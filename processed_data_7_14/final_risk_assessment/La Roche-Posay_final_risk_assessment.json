  "llm_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "HIGH",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high counterfeit/CCR risk score (99.85/100) with Amazon-specific fake product concerns",
      "High promotional content rate (61.8%) with significant content repetition (25.5%)",
      "Elevated sentiment risk (83.25/100) with organic negative sentiment at 9.5%",
      "Multiple risk indicators across promotional content (high promo rate, high duplicate rate)",
      "Presence of affiliate marketing dominance (40 instances) potentially diluting brand control"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The risk assessment confirms a HIGH risk level primarily driven by the alarming counterfeit concerns and promotional content issues. While the counterfeit risk represents only 5% of the weighted score, the near-perfect risk score (99.85/100) indicates critical authenticity concerns, particularly on Amazon where multiple fake product reports were identified. This represents a serious threat to brand integrity and consumer trust, especially for a dermatological skincare brand where product efficacy and safety are paramount.\n\nThe promotional landscape shows concerning patterns with affiliates dominating the conversation (40 instances versus only 13 brand-official communications), suggesting La Roche-Posay may be losing control of its brand narrative. The high promotional rate (61.8%) combined with significant content repetition (25.5%) indicates potential market saturation and diminishing authenticity in consumer engagement. When paired with the elevated sentiment risk score and organic negative sentiment nearly three times higher than overall negative sentiment, this suggests underlying consumer dissatisfaction that may be masked by promotional content but emerging in authentic conversations.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Investigate Amazon counterfeit reports immediately and engage with platform's brand protection services",
      "2. Conduct audit of affiliate marketing partners with focus on content quality and compliance",
      "3. Increase official brand presence to counter the affiliate-dominated conversation",
      "4. Develop response strategy for organic negative sentiment, particularly addressing specific product concerns",
      "5. Implement temporary monitoring of all \"suspicious source\" mentions to identify unauthorized sellers",
      "6. Contact top affiliates to reduce content repetition and establish new guidelines"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop comprehensive anti-counterfeit strategy including product authentication features and consumer education\n2. Restructure affiliate program with stricter quality controls, content guidelines, and performance metrics\n3. Create balanced content ecosystem with increased brand-controlled messaging and authentic UGC\n4. Establish sentiment improvement targets with focus on addressing recurring negative themes\n5. Implement regular seller verification process across all e-commerce platforms\n6. Develop crisis management protocol specifically for counterfeit/fake product allegations\n7. Invest in consumer education about identifying authentic La Roche-Posay products",
    "business_impact": "1. Revenue loss from diverted sales to counterfeit products\n2. Potential safety incidents and liability if consumers use fake products\n3. Erosion of brand trust and reputation damage in dermatological community\n4. Decreased marketing effectiveness due to promotional content saturation\n5. Reduced customer lifetime value as trust issues impact repeat purchases\n6. Potential regulatory scrutiny if counterfeit products cause consumer harm\n7. Weakened brand positioning as a premium dermatological solution",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Counterfeit mentions: Track daily with immediate escalation for any new reports\n2. Amazon product reviews: Monitor 3x weekly for authenticity concerns (escalate at >2 new concerns)\n3. Organic sentiment: Track weekly with focus on non-promotional conversations (escalate if organic negative sentiment exceeds 12%)\n4. Promotional content ratio: Maintain below 50% (currently 61.8%)\n5. Content repetition rate: Reduce to below 15% (currently 25.5%)\n6. Brand-to-affiliate ratio: Improve to at least 1:2 (currently approximately 1:3)\n7. Suspicious source mentions: Daily tracking with 24-hour response protocol"
