  "llm_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "CRITICAL",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high promotional content rate (86.2%) with significant affiliate marketing activity",
      "Perfect sentiment risk score (100/100) with concerning organic negative sentiment (26.9%)",
      "High content repetition rate (129.6%) suggesting coordinated promotional activity",
      "Significant comment intensity (84.1/100) creating visibility of potential issues",
      "Amazon-specific counterfeit concerns appearing in multiple comments"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The risk assessment for Optimum Nutrition reveals a critical situation primarily driven by an overwhelming promotional ecosystem that appears to be masking genuine consumer sentiment. With 86.2% of content being promotional (predominantly affiliate marketing), authentic consumer voices are being drowned out. This is particularly concerning when examining the organic negative sentiment rate of 26.9%, which indicates significant underlying consumer dissatisfaction that isn't immediately apparent in the overall metrics. The high content repetition rate (129.6%) suggests coordinated promotional campaigns that may be artificially inflating positive sentiment while suppressing legitimate consumer concerns.\n\nThe presence of Amazon-specific counterfeit concerns, though small in absolute numbers, represents a serious threat to brand integrity and consumer safety for a supplement brand. The clustering efficiency of 49.7% indicates that nearly half of all comments follow similar patterns, suggesting potential manipulation of the brand's social media presence. This combination of high promotional activity, masked negative sentiment, and counterfeit concerns creates a perfect storm that could rapidly escalate into a brand crisis if left unaddressed.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Conduct emergency audit of affiliate marketing partners and suspend high-volume/repetitive promoters pending review",
      "2. Implement 48-hour monitoring of organic negative comments to identify specific product or safety concerns",
      "3. Contact Amazon directly regarding counterfeit product reports and request expedited investigation",
      "4. Deploy social listening tools focused on health/safety keywords related to the brand's supplements",
      "5. Prepare crisis communication templates addressing potential counterfeit/safety concerns",
      "6. Temporarily increase moderation resources to ensure all consumer complaints receive prompt responses"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a balanced promotional content strategy with maximum thresholds for affiliate marketing percentage\n2. Implement affiliate marketing guidelines requiring disclosure and authentic content creation\n3. Create a verified retailer program with authentication measures consumers can verify\n4. Establish a consumer safety reporting channel separate from general social media\n5. Develop a sentiment recovery plan targeting specifically identified consumer concerns\n6. Implement regular authenticity testing of products from various sales channels\n7. Create educational content about identifying authentic products and safe supplement usage",
    "business_impact": "1. Potential regulatory scrutiny if counterfeit supplements cause adverse health effects\n2. Significant revenue loss if consumer trust erodes in supplement efficacy and safety\n3. Long-term brand damage in a category where trust is paramount to success\n4. Potential legal liability if promotional content makes unsubstantiated claims\n5. Market share erosion to competitors with stronger authenticity verification\n6. Reduced effectiveness of legitimate marketing due to consumer skepticism\n7. Increased customer acquisition costs as organic advocacy decreases",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Organic sentiment rate: Escalate if negative sentiment exceeds 15% for 3 consecutive days\n2. Counterfeit mentions: Immediate escalation for any health/safety concerns\n3. Promotional content ratio: Target reduction to <50% within 30 days\n4. Content repetition rate: Alert if exceeds 50% on any given day\n5. Response rate to negative comments: Maintain >90% response rate within 24 hours\n6. Amazon product review sentiment: Monitor daily for sudden negative shifts\n7. Establish weekly executive dashboard comparing organic vs. promotional sentiment metrics"
