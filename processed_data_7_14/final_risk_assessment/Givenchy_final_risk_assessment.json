    "risk_level": "HIGH",
    "key_factors": [
      "High content repetition rate (52.3%) indicating potential coordinated activity",
      "Significant promotional content (18.3% of total comments) with affiliate marketing dominance",
      "Spam content detected, though at low volume (0.92%)",
      "Moderate comment intensity (31.5/100) with clustering efficiency of only 6.4%",
      "Low but present negative sentiment (1.8% overall, 2.2% in organic content)"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The risk assessment confirms a HIGH risk level primarily driven by content manipulation patterns rather than negative sentiment. The 52.3% content repetition rate suggests coordinated activity that could be artificially inflating brand presence or manipulating consumer perception. This is particularly concerning when combined with the promotional content analysis showing 18.3% of comments contain promotional elements, predominantly affiliate marketing (17 instances). While the absolute volume of comments is moderate (109 over 13 days), the repetitive nature and promotional concentration indicate potential manipulation of the brand's social media footprint.\n\nThe sentiment profile shows minimal negative content (1.8%), with trust and joy as dominant emotions, suggesting the immediate reputational risk is contained. However, the combination of high repetition, promotional concentration, and detected spam signals an environment where authentic consumer engagement is potentially being crowded out by commercial interests. The low clustering efficiency (6.4%) further indicates that these promotional activities are dispersed rather than concentrated, making them harder to isolate and address systematically.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Conduct manual review of the repetitive content patterns to identify specific accounts or networks responsible for the 52.3% duplication rate",
      "2. Implement temporary monitoring of all affiliate marketing mentions to assess legitimacy and compliance with brand guidelines",
      "3. Investigate the detected spam instance to determine if it represents an isolated case or potential emerging pattern",
      "4. Cross-reference promotional content with authorized marketing campaigns to identify unauthorized affiliates",
      "5. Perform spot checks on engagement metrics to identify potential artificial amplification of content"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop an affiliate marketing governance framework with clear guidelines, approval processes, and monitoring protocols\n2. Implement automated detection systems for repetitive content patterns and unauthorized promotional activities\n3. Create a verified partner program for legitimate affiliates and influencers to distinguish from unauthorized promotions\n4. Establish regular content authenticity audits to measure and improve the ratio of genuine consumer engagement\n5. Develop response protocols for different types of promotional content risks, with clear escalation paths\n6. Consider selective enforcement actions against persistent violators of promotional guidelines",
    "business_impact": "1. Erosion of authentic brand perception as consumers encounter artificial or commercially-driven content\n2. Potential revenue leakage through unauthorized affiliate marketing activities\n3. Distorted market intelligence due to manipulated social signals affecting product and marketing decisions\n4. Reduced effectiveness of legitimate marketing efforts competing with unauthorized promotional content\n5. Potential regulatory scrutiny if promotional content lacks proper disclosures or makes unauthorized claims\n6. Diminished social media ROI as engagement metrics become less reliable indicators of genuine consumer interest",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Content repetition rate: Flag for investigation if exceeds 30%, escalate if exceeds 50%\n2. Unauthorized promotional content: Track weekly volume, escalate if exceeds 15% of total content\n3. Clustering efficiency: Monitor for decreases below 10% indicating dispersed manipulation\n4. Sentiment trends in organic content: Escalate if negative sentiment exceeds 5% or shows upward trend\n5. Affiliate link patterns: Track new domains and link structures weekly to identify unauthorized affiliates\n6. Engagement authenticity metrics: Monitor ratio of unique engagers to total engagement, escalate if below 0.7"
