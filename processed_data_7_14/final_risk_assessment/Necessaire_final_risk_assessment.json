  "llm_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "LOW",
    "key_factors": [
      "Very low overall risk score (6.01/100)",
      "Minimal comment volume (only 3 comments over 8 days)",
      "No counterfeit/CCR risks detected (0/100)",
      "No promotional content risks identified (0/100)",
      "Moderate sentiment risk (20/100) with 33.3% mixed sentiment"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The comprehensive risk analysis for Necessaire indicates a LOW risk level, which aligns with the calculated assessment. The brand demonstrates minimal risk across most key metrics, with an extremely low overall score of 6.01/100. The most notable factor is the sentiment risk score of 20/100, driven by 33.3% mixed sentiment, though this represents just one comment given the small sample size. The dominant emotions detected (Trust, Neutral, Joy) are positive or neutral, suggesting no significant negative perception issues.\n\nThe extremely low comment volume (3 comments over 8 days) indicates limited social media engagement, which reduces potential exposure to risks but also suggests limited visibility. The complete absence of counterfeit concerns, promotional content risks, and spam further supports the low-risk assessment. While the mixed sentiment warrants monitoring, the overall risk profile does not suggest any immediate concerns requiring urgent intervention.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Maintain standard monitoring protocols without need for escalation",
      "2. Review the specific content of the mixed sentiment comment to identify any potential product or service issues",
      "3. Consider implementing basic engagement strategies to increase social media visibility and gather more representative data",
      "4. Verify that monitoring tools are capturing all relevant brand mentions across platforms"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a proactive social media engagement plan to increase brand visibility and generate more consumer feedback\n2. Implement quarterly sentiment analysis reviews to track changes in consumer perception over time\n3. Create a lightweight early warning system that flags any sudden increases in negative sentiment or comment volume\n4. Consider competitive benchmarking to understand if low engagement is category-wide or specific to Necessaire\n5. Evaluate current social listening tools to ensure comprehensive coverage across relevant platforms where skincare discussions occur",
    "business_impact": "The current low risk profile suggests minimal negative business impact. However, the extremely low engagement could indicate:\n1. Limited brand awareness in digital channels\n2. Missed opportunities for consumer feedback and product improvement\n3. Potential vulnerability to competitors with stronger social media presence\n4. Difficulty in early detection of emerging issues due to limited data points",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Comment volume: Flag if daily average exceeds 2 comments (5x current rate)\n2. Sentiment tracking: Alert if negative sentiment exceeds 15% or mixed sentiment exceeds 40%\n3. Engagement metrics: Track month-over-month growth in brand mentions\n4. Platform distribution: Monitor which platforms generate brand discussions\n5. Escalation threshold: Immediate review if any counterfeit/CCR risks emerge or if promotional content risk exceeds 10/100"
