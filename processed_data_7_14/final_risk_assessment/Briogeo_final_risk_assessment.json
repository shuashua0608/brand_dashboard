  "llm_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "HIGH",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high promotional content rate (47.2%) with significant affiliate and influencer activity",
      "High content repetition rate (69.4%) suggesting coordinated promotional campaigns",
      "Low organic engagement with promotional content dominating conversations",
      "Negative sentiment in organic conversations (5.3%) that may be masked by promotional content",
      "Low overall comment volume (2.8 daily average) indicating limited authentic consumer engagement"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The risk assessment confirms a HIGH risk level primarily driven by the promotional content ecosystem surrounding Briogeo. With nearly half (47.2%) of all content being promotional in nature and dominated by affiliate and influencer marketing, the brand's social presence appears to be artificially maintained rather than driven by organic consumer interest. The concerning 69.4% content repetition rate suggests coordinated promotional campaigns that may be masking authentic consumer sentiment and creating a misleading impression of brand popularity.\n\nWhile the overall negative sentiment appears low at 2.8%, the organic negative sentiment rate is nearly double at 5.3%, indicating that promotional content is likely suppressing visibility of consumer concerns. The extremely low comment volume (only 2.8 comments per day) combined with the high promotional rate suggests the brand lacks genuine consumer engagement and may be overly dependent on paid or incentivized content. This creates significant vulnerability should promotional partners shift allegiance or if platform algorithms change to deprioritize promotional content.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Conduct manual review of all organic negative comments to identify specific product or service issues requiring immediate attention",
      "2. Implement temporary pause on affiliate marketing programs to assess baseline organic engagement",
      "3. Develop response protocols for addressing negative sentiment in organic conversations",
      "4. Audit top promotional partners for compliance with disclosure requirements and brand guidelines",
      "5. Establish daily monitoring of sentiment shifts among organic conversations"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Diversify engagement strategy to reduce dependency on promotional content by developing authentic community-building initiatives\n2. Implement stricter guidelines for promotional partners with emphasis on authentic content creation rather than repetitive messaging\n3. Develop a balanced content strategy with 70% organic/30% promotional target ratio\n4. Create dedicated customer feedback channels to capture and address concerns before they appear on social platforms\n5. Invest in product education content to build genuine consumer understanding of clean haircare benefits\n6. Establish quarterly promotional partner reviews with performance metrics tied to engagement quality, not just volume",
    "business_impact": "1. Potential algorithm penalties on social platforms that increasingly deprioritize promotional content\n2. Reduced consumer trust if perceived as a brand that relies on paid promotion rather than product quality\n3. Vulnerability to competitor disruption if authentic consumer loyalty is low\n4. Inefficient marketing spend with diminishing returns on promotional partnerships\n5. Risk of sudden visibility collapse if key promotional partners discontinue support\n6. Difficulty accurately assessing product market fit due to skewed feedback ecosystem",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Organic-to-promotional content ratio (escalate if organic falls below 40%)\n2. Sentiment trends in organic conversations (escalate if negative sentiment exceeds 8%)\n3. Content repetition rate (target reduction to below 30% within 60 days)\n4. Daily organic engagement metrics (comments, shares) with weekly trend analysis\n5. Conversion tracking from promotional vs. organic content (establish baseline within 30 days)\n6. Share of voice compared to competitors in organic conversations (establish baseline within 14 days)\n7. Promotional partner performance metrics beyond volume (engagement quality, sentiment, conversion)"
