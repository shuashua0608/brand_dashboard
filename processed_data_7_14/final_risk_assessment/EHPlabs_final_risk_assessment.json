  "llm_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "HIGH",
    "key_factors": [
      "100% promotional content rate with heavy influencer/affiliate marketing",
      "40% content repetition rate indicating coordinated promotional activity",
      "Highly imbalanced sentiment (exclusively positive) suggesting inauthentic engagement",
      "Low overall comment volume (only 25 comments over 11 days) with limited organic discussion",
      "Presence of suspicious source indicators despite low CCR risk score"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The risk assessment for EHPlabs confirms a HIGH risk level primarily driven by an extremely unbalanced content profile. The 100% promotional content rate combined with a 40% repetition rate strongly suggests a manufactured social media presence rather than authentic consumer engagement. The exclusive use of positive sentiment with no negative or mixed feedback is statistically improbable for a genuine supplement brand, indicating potential comment filtering or artificial engagement.\n\nWhile the absolute comment volume is low (25 comments over 11 days), the nature of these comments reveals a concerning pattern. The dominance of influencer (18) and affiliate (7) promotional content without corresponding organic consumer discussion creates a high-risk environment for potential reputation issues. The absence of negative sentiment doesn't indicate brand safety but rather suggests a carefully curated online presence that lacks authenticity, which could quickly collapse if genuine consumer concerns emerge.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Conduct manual review of all influencer/affiliate content for FTC disclosure compliance within 48 hours",
      "2. Implement sentiment diversification strategy to encourage authentic customer reviews",
      "3. Investigate the suspicious source indicator to rule out counterfeit product concerns",
      "4. Pause any automated comment filtering systems that may be suppressing negative feedback",
      "5. Establish emergency response protocols for potential consumer complaints about product efficacy/safety"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a balanced content strategy with 60% organic engagement and 40% promotional content\n2. Create a verified customer review program with incentives for honest feedback (both positive and negative)\n3. Implement advanced social listening tools to capture untagged mentions and competitor comparisons\n4. Establish quarterly authenticity audits to ensure promotional content meets transparency guidelines\n5. Develop relationships with fitness and nutrition experts for third-party credibility\n6. Create educational content about supplement safety and proper usage to build consumer trust",
    "business_impact": "1. Regulatory scrutiny from FTC for potential undisclosed promotional relationships\n2. Loss of consumer trust if the artificial engagement pattern becomes apparent\n3. Vulnerability to competitor attacks highlighting the lack of authentic reviews\n4. Reduced marketing effectiveness as algorithms increasingly prioritize authentic engagement\n5. Potential revenue decline of 15-30% if supplement efficacy concerns emerge without established trust\n6. Difficulty responding effectively to any product safety concerns due to lack of authentic communication channels",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Organic-to-promotional content ratio (target: minimum 40% organic within 30 days)\n2. Sentiment distribution (target: 60-80% positive, 10-30% neutral, 5-15% negative)\n3. Response rate to negative comments (target: 100% response within 24 hours)\n4. Engagement authenticity score (measure unique commenters vs. repeat promoters)\n5. Escalation threshold: Immediate alert for any product safety concerns or clusters of 3+ negative comments\n6. Weekly audit of influencer content compliance with disclosure requirements"
