  "llm_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "CRITICAL",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high counterfeit risk score (100/100) with 51 flagged instances",
      "Excessive promotional content (65.2% of all content) with high duplication (127.6%)",
      "Very high comment intensity (97.22/100) indicating coordinated activity",
      "Multiple risk indicators present simultaneously (suspicious sources, Amazon fake concerns, spam)",
      "Abnormal content patterns suggesting potential manipulation of brand conversation"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The risk assessment confirms a CRITICAL level primarily driven by the convergence of counterfeit concerns and manipulated promotional content. The perfect 100/100 counterfeit risk score, with 51 flagged instances (8 high-risk), indicates a significant threat to brand integrity and consumer safety. This is particularly concerning for fragrances, where counterfeit products can contain harmful ingredients. The 65.2% promotional content rate with 127.6% duplication suggests coordinated, potentially inauthentic activity dominating the brand conversation.\n\nWhat makes this situation particularly alarming is the combination of high comment intensity (97.22/100) with clustering efficiency at 46.2%, indicating potential coordinated campaigns. While sentiment appears positive (only 3.41/100 risk), this actually reinforces concerns about manipulation, as it's inconsistent with the high counterfeit indicators. The presence of Amazon-specific fake concerns (7 instances) suggests the counterfeit issue may be affecting authorized retail channels, compounding the risk to both brand reputation and consumer trust.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Initiate emergency counterfeit investigation focusing on the 8 high-risk instances identified",
      "2. Implement 24-hour monitoring of Amazon listings and report suspicious sellers",
      "3. Contact major social platforms to flag potential coordinated inauthentic behavior",
      "4. Prepare crisis communication materials addressing potential counterfeit concerns",
      "5. Conduct rapid audit of official promotional partners to identify unauthorized affiliates",
      "6. Temporarily pause influencer campaigns until proper vetting can be completed",
      "7. Deploy authentication messaging across official brand channels"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop comprehensive anti-counterfeit strategy including product authentication technology\n2. Establish formal affiliate/influencer guidelines with clear disclosure requirements\n3. Implement advanced social listening tools specifically targeting counterfeit discussions\n4. Create consumer education campaign about authentic product identification\n5. Strengthen e-commerce partnerships with enhanced verification protocols\n6. Review and potentially consolidate official promotional channels to better control messaging\n7. Develop rapid response protocol for future counterfeit incidents",
    "business_impact": "1. Revenue loss from diverted sales to counterfeit products (estimated 5-15% for luxury fragrances)\n2. Potential safety incidents and liability from consumers using counterfeit products\n3. Brand equity erosion from association with low-quality counterfeits\n4. Diminished effectiveness of legitimate marketing due to oversaturation of promotional content\n5. Reduced consumer trust in authentic products, particularly in online channels\n6. Increased customer service costs handling complaints about suspected fakes\n7. Potential regulatory scrutiny regarding product safety and promotional practices",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Counterfeit mentions: Track daily, escalate if new high-risk instances exceed 3 per day\n2. Amazon reviews: Monitor hourly for fake product concerns, escalate immediately if >5 new cases\n3. Promotional content ratio: Target reduction to <40%, escalate if remains >60% after 7 days\n4. Content duplication rate: Track daily, target <50%, escalate if remains >100%\n5. Sentiment tracking: Monitor for sudden increases in negative sentiment (>10% change)\n6. Suspicious source tracking: Establish baseline of legitimate sources, flag new unknown sources\n7. Geographic anomalies: Monitor for unusual activity clusters from atypical locations"
