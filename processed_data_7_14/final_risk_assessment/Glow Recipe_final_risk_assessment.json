    "key_factors": [
      "High promotional content rate (41.7%) with affiliate marketing dominance",
      "Low overall comment volume (only 12 comments over 9 days)",
      "Absence of negative sentiment despite high promotional content",
      "Presence of trust and joy as top emotions",
      "No counterfeit/CCR risks detected"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The calculated risk score of 16.37/100 suggests a lower risk profile than the initially assigned HIGH level. While the promotional content rate of 41.7% is concerning (primarily through affiliate marketing), several mitigating factors justify downgrading to MEDIUM risk. The complete absence of negative sentiment (0%), counterfeit issues (0%), and spam content (0%) indicates that current promotional activities aren't damaging brand perception. The emotional profile showing trust and joy as dominant emotions further supports a healthier brand environment than the raw score suggests.\n\nThe extremely low comment volume (just 12 comments over 9 days) is both a mitigating factor and a concern. While it means limited negative exposure, it also indicates low engagement and reduced visibility, making the high promotional percentage more significant as it dominates the limited conversation. The imbalance between organic and promotional content suggests potential authenticity issues that could impact consumer trust long-term, even though current sentiment remains positive.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Conduct affiliate marketing audit to identify top promoters and assess content quality/compliance",
      "2. Implement temporary guidelines for affiliates to reduce promotional density",
      "3. Create and distribute 2-3 pieces of engaging organic content to stimulate non-promotional conversation",
      "4. Reach out to 3-5 trusted micro-influencers for authentic product experiences rather than heavy promotion",
      "5. Set up daily monitoring alerts for any emerging negative sentiment"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a balanced content strategy with optimal promotional-to-organic ratio (target 20-25% promotional)\n2. Create an affiliate/influencer program with clear guidelines emphasizing authentic experiences over aggressive promotion\n3. Implement a community engagement plan to increase organic conversation volume\n4. Establish a sentiment early warning system with automated alerts\n5. Develop educational content about product authenticity to differentiate from potential future counterfeits\n6. Create a quarterly promotional content calendar to better distribute and control promotional activities",
    "business_impact": "1. Continued promotional imbalance could erode brand authenticity perception despite current positive sentiment\n2. Low engagement levels may indicate weakening brand relevance or community connection\n3. Over-reliance on affiliate marketing creates vulnerability if affiliate policies change\n4. Current positive sentiment could mask developing issues that aren't surfacing due to low conversation volume\n5. Missed opportunity to leverage positive sentiment for organic growth and community building",
    "monitoring_priorities": "\u2022 Daily tracking of promotional-to-organic content ratio (escalate if exceeds 30%)\n\u2022 Weekly sentiment analysis with alerts for any negative sentiment above 5%\n\u2022 Engagement rate per post (escalate if consistently below industry benchmark)\n\u2022 Affiliate content quality score (establish baseline and track weekly)\n\u2022 Share of voice compared to 2-3 key competitors (escalate if declining for 2+ weeks)\n\u2022 Emotion distribution trends (escalate if trust metrics decline for 2 consecutive weeks)"
