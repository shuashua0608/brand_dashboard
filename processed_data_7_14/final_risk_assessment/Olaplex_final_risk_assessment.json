  "llm_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "CRITICAL",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high promotional content rate (86.4%) with significant affiliate marketing activity",
      "Very high content repetition rate (120.2%) indicating coordinated promotional campaigns",
      "High comment intensity (37.2 daily average) with poor clustering efficiency (35.5%)",
      "Significant disparity between overall and organic negative sentiment (1.2% vs 9.1%)",
      "Presence of Amazon-specific counterfeit concerns, though limited in volume"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The risk assessment for Olaplex confirms a CRITICAL risk level primarily driven by an overwhelming promotional content ecosystem that appears to be masking underlying consumer sentiment issues. With 86.4% of content being promotional (372 affiliate posts) and a content repetition rate exceeding 120%, there is strong evidence of a coordinated promotional campaign that is artificially inflating positive brand presence. This is particularly concerning when examining the significant disparity between overall negative sentiment (1.2%) and organic negative sentiment (9.1%), suggesting that authentic consumer concerns are being drowned out by promotional content.\n\nThe combination of high comment volume (37.2 daily average) with poor clustering efficiency (35.5%) indicates that conversations about Olaplex are scattered and difficult to monitor effectively. While counterfeit risks appear relatively contained (71.69/100), the presence of Amazon-specific fake product concerns represents a potential growth vector for brand damage. The overall pattern suggests a brand that is heavily reliant on affiliate and influencer marketing to maintain positive perception, potentially masking underlying product or reputation issues that could rapidly escalate if the promotional shield weakens.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Implement enhanced sentiment monitoring focused specifically on organic (non-promotional) content to better understand true consumer concerns",
      "2. Conduct audit of top 20-30 affiliate promoters to verify content quality and compliance with brand guidelines",
      "3. Investigate Amazon-specific counterfeit claims immediately, including test purchases from flagged sellers",
      "4. Establish crisis response protocol for potential rapid escalation of negative sentiment if promotional content decreases",
      "5. Deploy social listening tools specifically targeting keywords related to product performance issues in organic conversations"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a more balanced content strategy with less reliance on affiliate marketing and more authentic user-generated content\n2. Implement affiliate program quality controls including regular content reviews and performance metrics beyond sales\n3. Create dedicated anti-counterfeit initiatives for e-commerce channels, particularly Amazon, including consumer education\n4. Establish regular sentiment analysis reporting that separates promotional from organic content\n5. Develop more cohesive community management strategy to improve conversation clustering and response efficiency\n6. Consider product quality investigation based on organic negative sentiment themes",
    "business_impact": "1. Revenue vulnerability if affiliate network faces disruption or regulatory scrutiny\n2. Potential rapid reputation damage if promotional content decreases and reveals underlying negative sentiment\n3. Customer trust erosion from counterfeit products, particularly on major platforms like Amazon\n4. Decreased marketing efficiency due to over-reliance on promotional content\n5. Potential regulatory concerns regarding undisclosed affiliate relationships\n6. Difficulty accurately assessing product performance and consumer satisfaction due to skewed feedback ecosystem",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Organic sentiment ratio: Track weekly with alert threshold if organic negative sentiment exceeds 12%\n2. Promotional content ratio: Alert if drops below 70% (indicating potential affiliate network issues)\n3. Amazon-specific counterfeit mentions: Daily monitoring with immediate escalation for any increase above 3 mentions/day\n4. Content clustering efficiency: Work to improve above 50% for better conversation management\n5. Sentiment disparity: Monitor gap between overall and organic sentiment with alert if gap widens beyond 10 percentage points\n6. Establish dedicated tracking for specific product complaint categories from organic conversations"
