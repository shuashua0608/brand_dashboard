    "risk_level": "CRITICAL",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high promotional content rate (85.2%) with significant content repetition (129.7%)",
      "Concerning organic negative sentiment (10.3%) despite overall positive appearance",
      "Low clustering efficiency (25.1%) indicating disorganized conversation patterns",
      "Presence of Amazon-specific counterfeit concerns, though limited in volume",
      "Spam content detected, suggesting inadequate content moderation"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The risk assessment reveals a social media presence dominated by promotional content (85.2%), with an alarming content repetition rate of 129.7%. This indicates an echo chamber effect where the same messaging is being amplified across channels, potentially masking genuine consumer sentiment. The disparity between overall negative sentiment (1.5%) and organic negative sentiment (10.3%) suggests promotional content is artificially inflating positive sentiment metrics, creating a misleading picture of brand health.\n\nThe low clustering efficiency (25.1%) combined with high comment intensity indicates disorganized conversation patterns that make monitoring difficult and increase vulnerability to emerging issues. While counterfeit concerns are currently limited, the presence of Amazon-specific fake product concerns could signal the beginning of a larger counterfeit problem. The detection of spam content further suggests inadequate content moderation practices that could allow more serious issues to proliferate undetected.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Implement emergency content moderation protocols focusing on Amazon-related counterfeit claims",
      "2. Reduce promotional content by 30-40% across channels to improve organic conversation visibility",
      "3. Engage directly with users expressing negative organic sentiment to address concerns",
      "4. Conduct rapid audit of all promotional partners to identify sources of repetitive content",
      "5. Deploy sentiment analysis specifically targeting product authenticity discussions",
      "6. Establish daily monitoring of organic sentiment separate from promotional content"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a balanced content strategy with healthier ratio of promotional to organic content (target: 50-60% maximum promotional content)\n2. Implement advanced duplicate content detection and management system\n3. Create dedicated response protocols for counterfeit claims with direct escalation paths\n4. Establish relationships with marketplace platforms (especially Amazon) for coordinated counterfeit response\n5. Redesign influencer guidelines to encourage authentic, diverse content creation\n6. Develop sentiment benchmarks by product category to better detect emerging issues\n7. Implement quarterly promotional content audits to prevent future saturation",
    "business_impact": "1. Reputation damage if counterfeit concerns spread beyond current limited scope\n2. Decreased consumer trust in product authenticity, particularly in e-commerce channels\n3. Reduced effectiveness of marketing spend due to promotional content saturation\n4. Potential revenue loss if consumers avoid purchasing due to authenticity concerns\n5. Increased customer service costs handling authenticity verification requests\n6. Possible regulatory scrutiny if counterfeit issues escalate and consumer complaints increase\n7. Long-term brand equity erosion if artificial sentiment masks underlying product issues",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Organic sentiment rate: Monitor daily, escalate if exceeds 15% negative\n2. Counterfeit/authenticity mentions: Zero tolerance, immediate escalation for any new mentions\n3. Content repetition rate: Target reduction to <80%, escalate if exceeds 100%\n4. Promotional content ratio: Track daily, target reduction to <70% within 14 days\n5. Clustering efficiency: Improve to >40% within 30 days\n6. Amazon-specific sentiment: Dedicated tracking, escalate if negative sentiment exceeds 5%\n7. Spam detection rate: Target <0.1%, implement automated alerts for any detected spam"
