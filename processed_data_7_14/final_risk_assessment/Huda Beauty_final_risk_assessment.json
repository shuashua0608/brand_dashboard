  "llm_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "HIGH",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high counterfeit/CCR risk score (100/100) with multiple Amazon fake concerns",
      "High promotional content rate (44.1%) with significant content repetition (29.4%)",
      "Multiple risk indicators present (high promo rate, high duplicate rate)",
      "Affiliate and influencer promotions dominating conversation (14 of 34 comments)",
      "Low overall comment volume (only 2.6 comments per day) limiting organic brand conversation"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The risk assessment confirms a HIGH risk level primarily driven by counterfeit concerns and promotional content saturation. While the overall comment volume is low (only 34 comments over 13 days), the quality of these interactions raises significant brand protection concerns. The perfect counterfeit risk score (100/100) indicates a critical situation where consumers are actively discussing fake Huda Beauty products, particularly on Amazon (4 specific mentions). This represents an immediate threat to brand integrity, consumer safety, and revenue.\n\nThe promotional content analysis reveals that nearly half (44.1%) of all brand mentions are promotional in nature, with affiliate marketing and influencer content dominating the conversation. Combined with the high content repetition rate (29.4%), this suggests an unbalanced brand presence where authentic consumer engagement is being drowned out by marketing content. While sentiment remains largely positive (no negative sentiment detected), this appears to be because actual consumer voices are underrepresented in the conversation. The clustering efficiency of only 8.8% indicates fragmented discussions without cohesive themes, making it difficult to identify and address emerging issues.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Initiate Amazon brand registry investigation focusing on the 4 identified counterfeit concerns",
      "2. Implement social listening for specific counterfeit keywords and suspicious source mentions",
      "3. Contact top affiliates to review their promotional practices and reduce repetitive content",
      "4. Develop and distribute authentic product verification guidelines to consumers",
      "5. Create emergency response templates for consumers reporting fake products",
      "6. Conduct audit of all authorized sellers and distribution channels"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a comprehensive anti-counterfeit strategy including product authentication features\n2. Establish a balanced content strategy to increase organic consumer engagement\n3. Create affiliate/influencer guidelines with quality standards to reduce repetitive content\n4. Implement regular marketplace monitoring program across all sales channels\n5. Develop consumer education campaign about authentic product identification\n6. Build relationships with e-commerce platforms for expedited counterfeit reporting\n7. Consider legal action against persistent counterfeiters identified through monitoring",
    "business_impact": "1. Revenue loss from diverted sales to counterfeit products\n2. Potential product safety incidents and liability from counterfeit products\n3. Brand reputation damage from consumers unknowingly using inferior fake products\n4. Decreased consumer trust in online purchasing channels\n5. Reduced marketing effectiveness due to oversaturation of promotional content\n6. Diminished authentic community engagement and brand advocacy\n7. Potential negative impact on retailer relationships if counterfeits become widespread",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Counterfeit mentions: Track daily, escalate immediately if new sources identified\n2. Amazon-specific counterfeit reports: Set threshold of 2+ new reports for immediate escalation\n3. Promotional content ratio: Target reduction to <30%, monitor weekly\n4. Content repetition rate: Target reduction to <15%, monitor weekly\n5. Organic engagement metrics: Track daily, aim for 5+ genuine consumer comments per day\n6. Sentiment tracking: Establish baseline and monitor for any negative shifts (threshold: >5% negative)\n7. Suspicious source mentions: Zero tolerance, immediate investigation of any new mentions"
