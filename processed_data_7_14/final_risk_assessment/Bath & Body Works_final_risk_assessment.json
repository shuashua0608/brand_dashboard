  "llm_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "CRITICAL",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high sentiment risk (100/100) with 21.1% organic negative sentiment",
      "High promotional content rate (54.2%) with significant content repetition (68.7%)",
      "Multiple risk indicators present (high promo rate, high duplicate rate)",
      "Presence of counterfeit/CCR risks including fake products and suspicious sources",
      "Moderate comment intensity with clustering suggesting coordinated activity"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The risk assessment confirms a CRITICAL risk level primarily driven by the alarming sentiment risk score of 100/100, with over 21% of organic comments expressing negative sentiment. This is significantly above acceptable thresholds and indicates serious consumer dissatisfaction. When combined with the high promotional content rate (54.2%) and content repetition rate (68.7%), this suggests a problematic pattern where the brand's social media presence is dominated by promotional content while actual consumers express negative experiences.\n\nThe presence of counterfeit risks, though weighted less heavily in the overall score, adds another concerning dimension as fake products and suspicious sources can directly damage brand reputation and consumer trust. The comment intensity metrics, particularly the clustering efficiency of 19.3%, suggest some level of coordinated activity that may be artificially influencing the brand's social media presence. This combination of negative organic sentiment, high promotional content, and potential coordinated activity creates a critical risk environment requiring immediate intervention.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Conduct emergency sentiment analysis deep-dive to identify specific product issues or service complaints driving negative sentiment",
      "2. Implement 24-hour monitoring of negative comments with immediate response protocol",
      "3. Investigate and document all identified counterfeit/suspicious source instances",
      "4. Temporarily reduce promotional content by 50% to rebalance organic vs. promotional ratio",
      "5. Engage directly with users expressing negative sentiment to demonstrate responsiveness",
      "6. Identify and address any coordinated negative posting patterns",
      "7. Brief executive team on critical risk status and initial mitigation efforts"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop comprehensive anti-counterfeit strategy including monitoring and enforcement\n2. Implement sentiment-based early warning system with automated alerts\n3. Establish healthier promotional content guidelines with maximum thresholds (30-35%)\n4. Create crisis communication playbook specific to product quality and authenticity issues\n5. Conduct quarterly brand health assessments focusing on sentiment trends\n6. Develop stronger verification processes for promotional partners and affiliates\n7. Implement content diversification strategy to reduce repetition rates below 40%\n8. Consider product quality review if negative sentiment relates to specific product lines",
    "business_impact": "1. Potential significant revenue decline (10-15%) if negative sentiment translates to reduced purchases\n2. Erosion of brand premium positioning in fragrance/personal care market\n3. Increased customer acquisition costs as negative word-of-mouth spreads\n4. Potential regulatory scrutiny if counterfeit products cause consumer harm\n5. Reduced effectiveness of marketing spend due to sentiment environment\n6. Decreased retailer confidence potentially affecting shelf space and positioning\n7. Long-term brand equity damage requiring costly rehabilitation campaigns",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Daily sentiment tracking with alert threshold at >10% negative organic sentiment\n2. Promotional content ratio (target: <40%, alert at >50%)\n3. Content repetition rate (target: <40%, alert at >60%)\n4. Counterfeit/suspicious source mentions (zero tolerance, immediate alert)\n5. Response rate to negative comments (target: 90% within 4 hours)\n6. Sentiment recovery metrics (target: 50% conversion of negative to neutral/positive)\n7. Weekly executive dashboard showing risk level trends and mitigation effectiveness"
