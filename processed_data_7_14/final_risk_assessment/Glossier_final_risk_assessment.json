    "risk_level": "HIGH",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high sentiment risk (100/100) with 11.8% organic negative sentiment",
      "Significant promotional content (37% of all content) with influencer dominance",
      "Very low comment volume (only 2.1 comments per day) indicating potential engagement issues",
      "Negative emotions present in 11.1% of content despite brand's positive positioning",
      "Disconnect between promotional activity and authentic engagement"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The risk assessment confirms a HIGH risk level primarily driven by the concerning sentiment metrics. With a perfect 100/100 sentiment risk score and 11.8% organic negative sentiment, Glossier is experiencing significant negative feedback that contradicts its minimalist, skin-first philosophy. This negative sentiment is particularly concerning given the low overall comment volume (only 27 comments over 13 days), suggesting that a substantial portion of the limited brand conversation is negative.\n\nThe promotional content analysis reveals that 37% of all content is promotional, predominantly from influencers rather than authentic user-generated content. This imbalance between promotional and organic engagement, combined with the negative sentiment in organic content, indicates a potential authenticity gap. The brand appears to be relying heavily on influencer marketing while actual customers express dissatisfaction. The extremely low comment intensity score (0.23/100) further supports this conclusion, showing minimal organic engagement despite promotional efforts.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Conduct urgent sentiment analysis deep-dive to identify specific product/service issues driving negative feedback",
      "2. Engage directly with users expressing negative sentiment to address concerns and demonstrate responsiveness",
      "3. Temporarily reduce influencer promotional content while increasing authentic engagement strategies",
      "4. Implement rapid response protocol for addressing negative comments within 24 hours",
      "5. Review recent product changes or launches that may correlate with negative sentiment spike"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a balanced content strategy with healthier ratio between promotional and organic content\n2. Create a customer feedback integration program to address product concerns identified in negative comments\n3. Implement sentiment monitoring dashboard with weekly executive reporting\n4. Diversify promotional strategy beyond heavy influencer reliance to include more authentic UGC\n5. Establish engagement-focused community building initiatives aligned with \"skin first\" philosophy\n6. Conduct quarterly sentiment analysis to track improvements and identify emerging issues",
    "business_impact": "If unaddressed, these risks could lead to declining brand perception in a highly competitive makeup category. The high negative sentiment combined with low engagement suggests customer dissatisfaction that could impact retention and lifetime value. The heavy reliance on promotional content without corresponding positive organic engagement indicates marketing inefficiency and potential wasted spend. For a brand built on minimalist, authentic positioning, the sentiment-promotion disconnect threatens core brand equity and could lead to reduced market share as customers seek alternatives more aligned with their expectations.",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Organic sentiment ratio: Track weekly with escalation if negative sentiment exceeds 8%\n2. Engagement-to-promotion ratio: Monitor balance between promotional and organic content (target <25% promotional)\n3. Response rate to negative comments: Maintain >90% response rate within 24 hours\n4. Sentiment by product category: Identify specific products driving negative feedback\n5. Emotional valence tracking: Monitor trust and joy metrics with alerts if they decline by >5%\n6. Daily comment volume: Set minimum threshold of 5 authentic comments per day with alerts if volume drops below target"
