  "llm_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "HIGH",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high counterfeit/CCR risk score (100/100) with Amazon-specific fake product concerns",
      "High promotional content rate (70.6%) with significant affiliate and influencer marketing",
      "Notable content repetition rate (23.5%) suggesting coordinated promotional activity",
      "Combination of high promotional activity with counterfeit concerns creates amplified risk"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The HIGH risk assessment is justified primarily by the dangerous combination of counterfeit product concerns on Amazon alongside an unusually high rate of promotional content. While the absolute number of counterfeit reports is relatively small (2 instances), they represent specific Amazon fake product concerns that could rapidly escalate consumer trust issues. This is particularly concerning when paired with the 70.6% promotional content rate, as promotional activities may inadvertently direct consumers toward counterfeit products.\n\nThe brand's social media presence shows signs of being heavily marketing-driven (70.6% promotional content) with significant affiliate and influencer involvement. The 23.5% content repetition rate suggests coordinated promotional campaigns that could amplify any negative issues. Despite the current absence of negative sentiment (0%), the high promotional environment creates a vulnerable situation where any product quality issues or counterfeit experiences could rapidly trigger negative sentiment cascades, especially given the premium positioning of this skincare brand where product authenticity is paramount.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Investigate Amazon counterfeit reports immediately and engage with Amazon Brand Registry",
      "2. Implement social listening specifically for terms related to \"fake\" + \"Drunk Elephant\" across all platforms",
      "3. Audit top affiliate and influencer partners to ensure they're directing to authorized retailers only",
      "4. Create crisis communication templates addressing potential counterfeit concerns",
      "5. Temporarily reduce promotional intensity while counterfeit investigation is underway"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a comprehensive anti-counterfeit strategy including product authentication features\n2. Create educational content for consumers about how to identify authentic Drunk Elephant products\n3. Establish stricter affiliate/influencer guidelines requiring explicit authorized retailer links\n4. Implement regular marketplace scanning (Amazon, eBay, etc.) for unauthorized sellers\n5. Diversify promotional content to reduce repetition and create more organic engagement\n6. Consider direct-to-consumer incentives to reduce third-party marketplace purchases",
    "business_impact": "1. Revenue loss from diverted sales to counterfeit products\n2. Potential reputation damage if consumers experience adverse reactions from fake products\n3. Erosion of premium brand positioning if counterfeits become widespread\n4. Reduced effectiveness of marketing spend if consumers become skeptical of promotional content\n5. Possible negative impact on retail partnerships if unauthorized channels gain market share\n6. Long-term customer loyalty decline if product authenticity concerns persist",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Daily tracking of counterfeit/fake product mentions across all platforms (Escalation threshold: >3 new mentions in 24 hours)\n2. Weekly audit of top 20 search results for \"Drunk Elephant Amazon\" and similar terms\n3. Sentiment tracking specifically for product authenticity discussions (Escalation threshold: any negative sentiment spike >5%)\n4. Conversion rates from affiliate/influencer links to verify they lead to legitimate purchases\n5. Ratio of promotional to organic content (Target: reduce to <50% promotional within 30 days)\n6. Geographic distribution of counterfeit reports to identify potential problematic supply chains"
