    "risk_level": "HIGH",
    "key_factors": [
      "High promotional content rate (31.9%) with significant content repetition (38.3%)",
      "Elevated negative sentiment in organic conversations (6.2%)",
      "Presence of spam content (4.26%) and affiliate marketing dominance",
      "Amazon-specific counterfeit concerns emerging",
      "Low authentic engagement despite promotional activity"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The Giorgio Armani fragrances brand is experiencing a concerning pattern where promotional content (31.9% of total) is dominating the conversation, yet authentic engagement remains low. The high content repetition rate (38.3%) suggests coordinated promotional activities that aren't generating genuine consumer interest. This imbalance between promotional efforts and organic engagement indicates potential market perception issues. The presence of spam (4.26%) alongside legitimate affiliate marketing further dilutes authentic brand conversations.\n\nWhat's particularly concerning is that despite the heavy promotional activity, negative sentiment in organic conversations (6.2%) exceeds the overall negative rate (4.3%), suggesting that actual consumers may be less satisfied than the promotional content implies. The emergence of Amazon-specific counterfeit concerns, while currently limited, represents a potential escalation point that could damage brand integrity in a key sales channel. The combination of these factors creates a high-risk environment where brand perception could rapidly deteriorate if left unaddressed.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Conduct audit of all affiliate marketing partners to identify sources of repetitive content and establish stricter guidelines",
      "2. Investigate Amazon counterfeit claims immediately and engage Amazon brand protection services",
      "3. Implement sentiment monitoring specifically for organic conversations to identify product or experience issues",
      "4. Temporarily reduce promotional posting frequency to improve organic/promotional content ratio",
      "5. Deploy social listening tools focused on detecting counterfeit discussions across all platforms"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a balanced content strategy with optimal promotional-to-organic ratio (target <20% promotional)\n2. Create an affiliate marketing code of conduct with clear guidelines on posting frequency and content uniqueness\n3. Establish a dedicated anti-counterfeit task force combining legal, digital and marketing teams\n4. Implement influencer authentication program to distinguish official partners from unauthorized promoters\n5. Develop consumer education campaign about authentic product identification\n6. Invest in direct consumer engagement strategies to increase organic positive sentiment\n7. Create crisis response protocols specifically for counterfeit and product authenticity challenges",
    "business_impact": "1. Revenue erosion from counterfeit products (estimated 10-15% for luxury fragrance brands)\n2. Diminished brand equity and premium positioning due to association with spam content\n3. Reduced effectiveness of legitimate marketing spend as consumers become skeptical of promotional content\n4. Potential damage to retailer relationships, particularly with Amazon, if counterfeit issues escalate\n5. Long-term customer loyalty decline as authentic product experiences become diluted by counterfeits\n6. Increased customer service costs handling authenticity inquiries and complaints",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Organic-to-promotional content ratio (escalate if promotional exceeds 25%)\n2. Counterfeit mentions (escalate immediately at any increase above current baseline)\n3. Sentiment in organic conversations (escalate if negative exceeds 8%)\n4. Content repetition rate (escalate if exceeds 30%)\n5. Amazon-specific sentiment (escalate if negative exceeds 5%)\n6. Spam content prevalence (escalate if exceeds current 4.26%)\n7. Daily engagement metrics segmented by content type (promotional vs. organic)"
