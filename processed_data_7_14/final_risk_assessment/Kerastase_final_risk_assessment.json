    "key_factors": [
      "100/100 Sentiment Risk with 11.8% organic negative sentiment",
      "46% promotional content rate with high content repetition (39.7%)",
      "Multiple promotional types suggesting uncoordinated marketing efforts",
      "Presence of Amazon-specific counterfeit concerns",
      "Low comment volume but high repetition suggesting potential manipulation"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The most alarming factor is the perfect 100/100 sentiment risk score, driven by 11.8% organic negative sentiment and 7.9% negative emotions. This indicates genuine customer dissatisfaction rather than random negativity. When combined with the high promotional content rate (46%), this creates a dangerous situation where the brand is actively promoting products while customers express significant dissatisfaction.\n\nThe promotional content analysis reveals multiple concerning patterns - high repetition rate (39.7%), diverse promotional types (Affiliate, Influencer, Brand_Official, UGC_Campaign), and potential coordination issues. This suggests unmanaged or poorly coordinated marketing efforts across channels. The presence of Amazon-specific counterfeit concerns, though limited in volume, adds another layer of risk that could damage brand reputation and customer trust in authentic products.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Conduct sentiment analysis deep-dive to identify specific product/service issues driving negative sentiment",
      "2. Temporarily pause affiliate marketing programs showing highest repetition rates",
      "3. Investigate Amazon counterfeit claims and engage with platform's brand protection team",
      "4. Implement emergency social listening for specific product complaints",
      "5. Prepare crisis communication templates for potential escalation",
      "6. Audit top influencer partners for content quality and alignment"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop comprehensive promotional content guidelines with clear differentiation between affiliate, influencer, and brand content\n2. Implement promotional content calendar to prevent oversaturation\n3. Create authentication system/campaign to help customers identify genuine products\n4. Establish regular sentiment analysis reporting with action thresholds\n5. Develop product quality feedback loop between social listening and product development teams\n6. Implement influencer quality scoring system based on engagement quality, not just quantity\n7. Consider reducing promotional content percentage to 25-30% maximum",
    "business_impact": "1. Revenue loss from potential customer churn due to negative sentiment\n2. Diminished ROI on marketing spend due to oversaturation and repetitive content\n3. Brand equity erosion in luxury positioning due to counterfeit concerns\n4. Reduced effectiveness of future campaigns due to audience fatigue\n5. Potential loss of retail partnerships if brand perception continues to decline\n6. Legal and compliance risks from unmanaged affiliate marketing practices",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Organic negative sentiment: Set alert threshold at >5%, immediate action at >8%\n2. Promotional content density: Track daily, maintain below 35%, alert at >40%\n3. Content repetition rate: Reduce to <20%, alert at >25%\n4. Counterfeit mentions: Zero tolerance, immediate escalation for any new mentions\n5. Sentiment trend: Track 7-day moving average with alerts for negative trends\n6. Engagement quality: Track comment-to-like ratio and sentiment distribution\n7. Channel-specific sentiment: Monitor differences between platforms to identify platform-specific issues"
