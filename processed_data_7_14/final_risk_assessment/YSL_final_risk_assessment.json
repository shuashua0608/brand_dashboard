  "llm_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "HIGH",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high counterfeit/CCR risk score (83.66/100)",
      "High promotional content repetition rate (57.2%)",
      "Significant presence of influencer and affiliate marketing (56 instances)",
      "Low organic engagement with high promotional content ratio (50.9%)",
      "Presence of suspicious source reports and fake product concerns"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The HIGH risk assessment is justified primarily by the concerning counterfeit risk score of 83.66/100, which indicates potential brand integrity issues in the marketplace. While counterfeit mentions represent a small percentage of total comments, the presence of high-risk instances suggests a quality control problem that could damage brand perception. This is particularly concerning for a luxury brand like YSL where authenticity is paramount to maintaining premium positioning.\n\nThe promotional content analysis reveals an ecosystem heavily dominated by marketing activities (50.9% promotional rate) with significant content repetition (57.2%). This suggests the brand conversation is being driven more by paid or incentivized content than organic consumer engagement. The high concentration of influencer and affiliate marketing (56 combined instances) indicates potential over-reliance on these channels, which could lead to audience fatigue and diminished authenticity perception. While sentiment remains largely positive, the relatively low comment intensity (37.31/100) suggests limited organic engagement despite heavy promotional activity.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Initiate targeted monitoring of identified suspicious sources and investigate the high-risk counterfeit instance within 48 hours",
      "2. Contact Amazon regarding the specific fake product concern to address platform-specific issues",
      "3. Implement temporary pause on repetitive promotional content across channels to reduce saturation",
      "4. Conduct rapid audit of top 10 influencer partners to verify compliance with brand guidelines and authenticity messaging",
      "5. Deploy social listening tools focused on counterfeit-related keywords to identify additional unreported instances"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a more balanced content strategy with increased focus on organic engagement and reduced promotional density\n2. Establish a formal anti-counterfeit task force combining marketing, legal and e-commerce teams\n3. Create enhanced authentication education for consumers to help identify legitimate products\n4. Implement stricter influencer selection criteria and content guidelines to reduce repetition\n5. Diversify content types to reduce reliance on promotional posts and increase authentic brand storytelling\n6. Develop direct-to-consumer channels that can better control the purchase experience and product authenticity",
    "business_impact": "1. Revenue loss from diverted sales to counterfeit products\n2. Brand equity erosion from association with inferior fake products\n3. Decreased consumer trust in authentic YSL fragrances\n4. Reduced marketing effectiveness due to promotional content fatigue\n5. Potential legal liability from consumers who unknowingly purchased counterfeits\n6. Diminished luxury positioning if brand is perceived as over-promoted or commonly counterfeited",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Counterfeit mentions: Track daily with escalation threshold of >2 new high-risk instances per week\n2. Promotional content ratio: Maintain below 40% with weekly reporting\n3. Content repetition rate: Reduce to <30% within 30 days\n4. Organic engagement metrics: Track weekly with goal of 15% increase in non-promotional engagement\n5. Amazon-specific issues: Daily monitoring with immediate escalation of any new counterfeit concerns\n6. Sentiment tracking among organic posts: Maintain negative sentiment below 5% with alert if exceeds 7%"
