    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high counterfeit risk score (88.53/100) with multiple fake product and suspicious source reports",
      "High content repetition rate (65.8%) suggesting coordinated promotional activity",
      "Moderate negative sentiment in organic conversations (6.3%)",

    "reasoning": "The risk assessment for Chanel fragrances reveals a concerning pattern centered around counterfeit products and promotional content management. While the overall comment volume is moderate (34.2 daily comments), the extremely high counterfeit risk score (88.53/100) indicates a significant threat to brand integrity. The detection of 8 fake product mentions and 5 suspicious source reports suggests an active gray market that could damage consumer trust and brand value. This is particularly concerning for a luxury brand like Chanel where authenticity is paramount.\n\nThe promotional landscape shows potential manipulation with a 65.8% content repetition rate and a promotional content rate of 35.6%. The dominance of affiliate marketing (79 instances) over official brand communications (24 instances) indicates the brand may be losing control of its narrative. While negative sentiment remains relatively low at 4.3% overall, the higher rate in organic conversations (6.3%) suggests genuine customer concerns that could escalate if not addressed. The presence of spam content, though limited, further contributes to an environment where the authentic brand voice is being diluted.\n\n##",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Investigate and document the 8 fake product mentions and 5 suspicious sources for potential legal action",
      "2. Implement comment moderation to address the identified spam content (5 instances)",
      "3. Analyze the 79 affiliate marketing posts to identify unauthorized resellers or misleading claims",
      "4. Engage with users reporting negative experiences (focus on the 6.3% organic negative sentiment)",
      "5. Review Amazon-specific counterfeit concern and coordinate with marketplace enforcement team",
      "##"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a comprehensive anti-counterfeit strategy including:\n   - Regular monitoring of suspicious sellers and websites\n   - Consumer education campaign on authentic product identification\n   - Strengthened supply chain controls and authentication technology\n\n2. Rebalance promotional content ecosystem:\n   - Increase official brand content presence to counter affiliate dominance\n   - Create guidelines for authorized affiliates and influencers\n   - Implement affiliate tracking system to monitor compliance\n\n3. Sentiment management program:\n   - Address recurring themes in negative feedback\n   - Develop response protocols for different types of negative comments\n   - Create positive content strategy highlighting product quality and authenticity\n\n4. Platform-specific strategies:\n   - Amazon: Enhanced Brand Protection enrollment\n   - Social media: Verified seller program and reporting mechanisms\n\n##",
    "business_impact": "1. Revenue loss from counterfeit sales estimated at 2-5% of category revenue\n2. Brand equity erosion from association with inferior fake products\n3. Customer trust degradation leading to potential lifetime value reduction\n4. Price integrity challenges from unauthorized sellers and gray market activity\n5. Increased customer service costs handling authenticity inquiries and complaints\n6. Legal exposure from consumers who unknowingly purchased counterfeits\n7. Potential negative media coverage if counterfeit issues escalate\n\n##",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Counterfeit mentions: Track daily, escalate if >3 new instances in 24 hours\n2. Content repetition rate: Monitor weekly, target reduction to <40%\n3. Organic negative sentiment: Track daily, escalate if exceeds 8%\n4. Affiliate:Official content ratio: Target 2:1 or lower (currently ~3:1)\n5. Spam content rate: Zero tolerance, immediate escalation for any new instances\n6. Amazon marketplace metrics: Weekly monitoring of seller ratings and authenticity complaints\n7. Sentiment by product line: Identify if specific fragrances have higher risk profiles"
