  "llm_assessment": {
    "risk_level": "HIGH",
    "key_factors": [
      "Extremely high promotional content rate (59.1%) with significant affiliate marketing presence",
      "High content repetition rate (53.0%) suggesting coordinated posting patterns",
      "Presence of spam content (3.66%) requiring moderation",
      "Clustering efficiency of 12.8% indicating potential coordinated activity",
      "Imbalance between promotional and organic user-generated content"
    ],
    "reasoning": "The risk assessment confirms a HIGH risk level primarily driven by the overwhelming promotional content dominating E.L.F.'s social media presence. With 59.1% of content being promotional in nature (predominantly affiliate marketing), the brand's social channels appear to be heavily commercialized rather than community-driven. This is compounded by the high content repetition rate of 53%, suggesting coordinated posting patterns that could undermine authenticity and consumer trust. The presence of spam content (3.66%) further degrades the quality of the conversation.\n\nWhile sentiment remains overwhelmingly positive (virtually no negative sentiment detected), this should be interpreted cautiously given the promotional nature of the content. The positive sentiment likely stems from affiliates and influencers rather than genuine consumer advocacy. The clustering efficiency of 12.8% suggests potential coordinated posting activity that could be manipulating the brand's social presence. The imbalance between promotional and organic content represents a significant risk to E.L.F.'s brand perception as consumers increasingly value authenticity and may become skeptical of overly commercialized social channels.",
    "immediate_actions": [
      "1. Implement immediate spam content moderation protocols to remove the identified spam posts",
      "2. Conduct audit of top affiliate and influencer accounts to identify those with repetitive or low-quality content",
      "3. Temporarily reduce affiliate marketing incentives to decrease promotional content saturation",
      "4. Develop and deploy 3-5 organic engagement campaigns to stimulate genuine user content",
      "5. Establish emergency guidelines for community managers to increase organic interaction with existing users"
    ],
    "long_term_strategy": "1. Develop a balanced content ecosystem with target ratios (30% promotional, 70% organic) and implement gradual steps to achieve this balance\n2. Create a tiered affiliate program with quality standards and content guidelines to reduce repetitive promotional content\n3. Implement an influencer diversification strategy focusing on micro-influencers with higher engagement rates\n4. Develop a UGC incentive program that rewards authentic, non-promotional content from actual customers\n5. Establish a social listening program to identify and amplify organic positive sentiment\n6. Create a content calendar that balances promotional periods with community-building activities",
    "business_impact": "1. Diminished brand authenticity perception leading to reduced consumer trust\n2. Potential algorithm penalties on social platforms that prioritize authentic engagement\n3. Reduced effectiveness of future marketing campaigns due to promotional fatigue\n4. Difficulty distinguishing brand voice from affiliate/promotional noise\n5. Vulnerability to competitors who maintain more authentic social presences\n6. Decreased organic reach as platforms may limit visibility of heavily promotional accounts\n7. Reduced conversion rates as consumers become skeptical of overwhelmingly positive but inauthentic content",
    "monitoring_priorities": "1. Promotional/Organic Content Ratio: Track weekly with alert threshold at >40% promotional\n2. Content Repetition Rate: Monitor daily with alert threshold at >25%\n3. Spam Content Rate: Zero tolerance policy with immediate alerts for any detected spam\n4. Engagement Rate on Organic vs. Promotional Content: Track differential with alert if organic engagement falls below promotional\n5. Sentiment Distribution Among Verified Customers vs. Affiliates: Monitor weekly\n6. Clustering Efficiency: Alert threshold at >10% to identify potential coordinated posting\n7. Daily Comment Volume Variance: Alert on sudden drops (>30%) indicating potential audience disengagement"
