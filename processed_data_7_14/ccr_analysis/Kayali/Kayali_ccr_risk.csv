n2457jf,"  Zara Supreme Vanilla, it opens with wood notes and then turns into a sweet vanilla. Bellavita Honey Oud, it's like a lighter version of Khamrah that can even be worn in the summer. It's less than $20 right now on Amazon. This would be my #1 choice if I could only have one spicy vanilla. Bath and Body Works Vanilla Romance smells great and the lotion will keep its scent all day. It layers gorgeously with any perfume that has a bit of spice. Rifaaqat and Lattafa Sehr are not to my liking. I bought both and they smell like gasoline. Rifaaqat turns into a cheap smelling musk after a few hours. Sehr has never made it that long before I had to wash it off. Lattafa Artisan Ethnique is spicy vanilla with a hint of rum. Nebras is an Ellish dupe. Paris Corner December Vanilla is a boozy vanilla patchouli bomb. I smelled it when I got it, and thought no way can I ever wear that, but it grew on me. It feels like being retro, tough and elegant all at the same time. Paris Corner Vanilla Mood is an interesting one. It doesn't smell like vanilla at first, more of a vaguely pleasant scent, then turns to a slightly leathery, sweet vanilla. Miim Miic 94 is a Kayali Vanilla 28 dupe. Miim Miic 108 and Khair Confection are Kayali vanilla candy rock sugar dupes. Both good, Confection is a bit better to me, plus the bottle is pretty.","Zara Supreme Vanilla, it opens with wood notes and then turns into a sweet vanilla.

n2gniiq,"  So I've been buying Middle Eastern  perfumes for over 2yrs. I've educated myself to read the notes on Fragranctica and read reviews also on Amazon ( good source too) Also  YouTube influencers. I've been very, very lucky on blind buys. I only disliked 3 out of 170 bottles. I feel thats a homerun. I just realized I truly love the note of Lychee Rose combo. So I have serveral fragrances with that blended in them but not the star notes. I've seen ""PARIS CORNER KHAIR FUSION"". I bought it. Supposedly dupe of Kayali Sparkling Lychee. And Lychee top note. I'm familiar of the maceration process. But this has to be the most screechy opening. Like sour rinds of citrus (grapefruit). That's not listed in this. It is fruity forward  but hoping this morphs into the fresh frizzy summer sweet Lychee scent . Anyone have this perfume and after your maceration are you happy with it. According to Fragranctica it seems like a 60/40 split on likability. 60 liking....hope it's not a fail for me and it turns into jueville fragrance. I feel the same as ""Lattafa Ansaam Gold"". It's a jueville gummy bear scent supposedly dupe for PDM ""Oriana"" High end perfume. Need some opinions on"""" Khair Fusion"". Thanks","So I've been buying Middle Eastern perfumes for over 2yrs.
