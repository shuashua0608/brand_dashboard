n0t29qm,"  lots of other folks have mentioned that the example picture is dimensional vs all over color. like others have said, it would be better to use a 20 vol developer with the lightener powder for a longer period of time, instead of using 30 volume for a shorter period of time. if you got to the strand test color in 30 mins with 30 volume, you can definitely achieve it with a longer processing time using 20 volume and you'd be less likely to cause major damage. you can process for up to an hour, so just keep checking the color while the lightener processes. my recommendation would be to lighten your entire head in sections like you said you plan to, to get to a base color similar to what your strand test looks like. if you can wait a couple days and do some deep conditioning treatments after you have your base color, that would be best. i'd then go back in with a technique like this to achieve something similar to the highlights shown in your goal picture — she's obviously using a different tone of color here, but the takeaway of the video should be the lightener application techniques: https://youtu.be/gegncnXXxi0 pay attention to the volumes she is using — DO NOT go back in to highlight your base with 30 volume developer, your highlights will fry. you must use a 10 volume developer and give it time to process. she also has a lot of other great videos about doing highlights if you wanna browse her channel — again, don't focus on the color/toner shades she's using, just the bleach application techniques to help achieve the dimensional look in your example. imo, if you are okay with your base color matching your swatch, you'd be better off leaving it at that and then adding the highlights with a volume 10 developer, versus trying to lighten your whole head again. your hair would be much better off that way, versus trying to push it with another whole head application of lightener! you'd be very close to the example photo anyway after toning. sally's ion line has an olaplex dupe that you should definitely pick up. it's under $15 and one set would probably get you through 2-3 processes, so you might wanna pick up 2 boxes if your hair is thick, because it would be better to to have a little extra for next time vs. running out. here's the link, they have it in stores too: https://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-color/other-products-and-applications/fillers-and-additives/absolute-perfection-dual-kit/SBS-405019.html i'd also buy some k18 and apply it before/after processes: cheapest option here that i have been able to squeeze 2-3 applications out of in the past, but you'd be better off investing in the $30 pump bottle that's available on amazon: https://www.target.com/p/k18-leave-in-molecular-repair-hair-mask-0-17-oz/-/A-85972091 and then use a bond repairing shampoo and conditioner to help rebuild your hair integrity after all these processes. redken's bond repair line is pretty good and relatively affordable! pick up a nice serum too to keep the mids/ends healthy. if you can't invest in these products, i promise your hair would look better at whatever color it is now than lighter and unhealthy! but i think if you invest in the bond builder from sally's, k18, and a bond repairing shampoo and conditioner, your goal example is within reach. also not sure what your current base color is like or if you've done a whole head lightening process before, but make sure you understand how to apply the lightener for a whole head application so you don't end up with an uneven base color before you go back in to highlight. if you don't apply the lightener correctly you will end up with really uneven color — lighter roots from the heat of your head accelerating the bleach, etc. here is a good video that explains how to approach whole head lightening — as with the other example video, don't focus on the end result color, just pay attention to the techniques used to achieve an even color. adjust the processing times according to your goal base color: https://youtu.be/tYg3ZmbX5iw?si=mXSeHVLH6rBVWubP saw that you don't have sally's in your country. there are other products similar to olaplex; see if you can find ALL hd PLEX or LIW ph plex! i think you'd need to order them online. they are both similar products you will mix into the bleach and color during the color/lightening processes. this step is definitely the most important","lots of other folks have mentioned that the example picture is dimensional vs all over color. like others have said, it would be better to use a 20 vol developer with the lightener powder for a longer period of time, instead of using 30 volume for a shorter period of time. if you got to the strand test color in 30 mins with 30 volume, you can definitely achieve it with a longer processing time using 20 volume and you'd be less likely to cause major damage. you can process for up to an hour, so just keep checking the color while the lightener processes. my recommendation would be to lighten your entire head in sections like you said you plan to, to get to a base color similar to what your strand test looks like. if you can wait a couple days and do some deep conditioning treatments after you have your base color, that would be best. i'd then go back in with a technique like this to achieve something similar to the highlights shown in your goal picture — she's obviously using a different tone of color here, but the takeaway of the video should be the lightener application techniques: pay attention to the volumes she is using — DO NOT go back in to highlight your base with 30 volume developer, your highlights will fry. you must use a 10 volume developer and give it time to process. she also has a lot of other great videos about doing highlights if you wanna browse her channel — again, don't focus on the color/toner shades she's using, just the bleach application techniques to help achieve the dimensional look in your example. imo, if you are okay with your base color matching your swatch, you'd be better off leaving it at that and then adding the highlights with a volume 10 developer, versus trying to lighten your whole head again. your hair would be much better off that way, versus trying to push it with another whole head application of lightener!

n1872a7,"  Hi, pro here. The ingredients are not the same. If you put a bit of store bought shampoo in your palm can you turn it upside down? It boils down to the ph balance on what makes hair products professional or not truly. I am not personally a fan of sulfate free products. I like the active cleaning agents/bubbles. However; I will say Pantene is the worst for your hair. It has wax in it. You can literally wax your floors with it. Long term use causes a waxy build up that I've personally cut off of peoples hair shaft. It's awful and can cause much bigger issues. I can wash someone's hair and tell if they use it (often). K18 and Olaplex can be good. However, too much protein can cause breakage and frizz, you don't need it that often unless it's very damaged. Using professional products correctly is the key. Some people aren't educated in the type of hair they have and actual products or frequency of use. I should also mention, there's a lot of fakes and expired products sold with really good packaging. Unless it's sold in a professional salon (not Amazon or a grocery store) there isn't a guarantee you're actually getting the correct product. Just a food for thought from someone who's been in the industry over 20 years. Best wishes.","Hi, pro here. The ingredients are not the same.

n2aiqey,"  how long did you leave the bleach on? did you use 30vol developer with the powder? it will be really really difficult, probably impossible, to go back in with another round of bleach and not cause breakage from overlap between the roots and the lengths that were already lightened. this is too dark to fix with toner though. **your options are (in order of riskiest to least risky):** 1 - another round of lightening with a volume 10 developer. i would section the hair into quarters, then very precisely apply the bleach as carefully as possible to only the darker section, on only one quarter of your hair. process that quarter, watching super carefully (wiping off a bit of the lightener to check every 5-10mins) and washing out as soon as its light enough. start with a section in the back first so if you get breakage, it's only to one quarter of the hair in the back. do the whole head by completely lightening one quarter of the hair at a time, this would give you the most control and reduce the risk of damage. if something goes wrong with the first section and you end up with a lot of breakage, you could do the rest of the hair with one of these other options. if this is successful, you'd tone with a vol 5 or 10 developer and a light blonde toner. 2 - using a high lift blonde color on the dark band of the hair. look up videos/tutorials about this to see how it works. 3 - coloring the dark band with a darker blonde color (something like a level 7 or 8) and then doing a root tap (right at the root, like an inch) with a shade or two darker (level 7 or 6) than the color you use on the whole dark band. this is the safest bet and would cause the least amount of damage. you could also consider doing some lowlights throughout the lengths with the darker color you use on the band to help add dimension and make things look more blended. regardless of which you choose, i'd still recommend a level 7-8 root tap! it just looks nicer and more professional, esp. when you have darker hair naturally. and with all of these options, you should definitely pick up an olaplex dupe. the type you mix into both bleach and/or toner, not the hair oil or shampoo/conditioner. this will make a huge difference in whether your hair incurs a lot of damage or only a little. sally's has one in their ion line, and there are also other brands on amazon. look up how to use them first, just search on youtube for “olaplex bleach dupe”. i would also pick up k18 to use before / after any more coloring. it would help a lot too. you can buy tiny bottles for $12 that give you 1-2 applications or a decent size bottle for $29 on amazon. the bigger bottle would be better and help preserve your hair longer term since you're processing it so much. and also buy a bond repair shampoo/conditioner to help reduce breakage, redken's is decent and affordable.","how long did you leave the bleach on?
