The floral maxi dress, which is just ¬£48, is part of Roman's summer collection and would be perfect for park picnics or days out at the beach. And, right now, shoppers can save an extra 10% using the code HAPPY. The dress boasts short sleeves, offering some coverage, an attention-grabbing shirred waist, and a tassel tie detail. There's even a modest slit in the skirt for that extra bit of breeziness, reports Nottingham Post. When it comes to accessorising, the options are endless. Dress it up with sparkling heels and gold trinkets for formal occasions, or pair it with ballet flats and standout sunglasses for casual garden get-togethers. The dress comes in a selection of different patterns, too, including various floral prints and an on-trend polka dot print. The dress comes in sizes 10 to 20. However, several sizes are already sold out in some of the patterns. If your size isn't available, Phase Eight also offers a fantastic range, including this floral maxi dress (¬£109, originally ¬£189) with long sleeves for a similar feel to the Roman dress. For something different yet equally enchanting, Joe Browns showcases a stunning floral knee-length number (¬£48), available in both petite and regular sizes. It's designed to highlight the waist and features a delightful V-neckline. Customers have been heaping praise on the Roman Originals light blue dress, with one satisfied buyer exclaiming: ""It's a lovely colour, and the material keeps you cool in this hot weather."" Another happy shopper shared their enthusiasm: ""I love this dress. It fits my size 16, hangs nicely, and looks good with my trainers."" One more pleased customer couldn't hide their delight: ""I just love this dress - I feel amazing in it. When you are a larger person, as I am, it isn't easy to find something you like. The dress flows and gives me a nicer shape. Everyone thought I looked amazing and that I had lost some weight."" Yet, not all reviews were positive, with a dissatisfied customer stating: ""I loved this dress but was very disappointed with the length. It was far too long."" On the other hand, another contented patron praised their find: ""(The dress is) beautiful, a wonderful fit, and a perfect length. I'm 5'7"". When you put on the dress, you feel amazing.

No es una paleta cualquiera. Fue desarrollada junto a Kate Moss, quien aporta ese toque cool brit√°nico a una f√≥rmula pr√°ctica y efectiva.

Pero en la pr√°ctica, tambi√©n ofrece versatilidad total: El bronceador es de tono neutro, sin subtono naranja, ideal para contorno sutil o efecto sunkissed. El iluminador tiene destello fino, nada glitter, que aporta ese glow elegante estilo Hailey Bieber. El rubor es rosa-melocot√≥n universal, favorecedor en todo tipo de pieles, que da ese toque de vitalidad instant√°nea.

Por 6 euros, la Rimmel Sculpting Palette ofrece calidad, practicidad y versatilidad. Perfecta para principiantes, minimalistas, chicas que viajan o quienes buscan un glow con poco esfuerzo. No sustituye a productos de gama alta en textura extrema o larga duraci√≥n tipo red carpet, pero para el d√≠a a d√≠a y looks de oficina o citas, es m√°s que suficiente.

mov_058A476C836C36EC4FB309836609132E,"‚Äâ In honour of their charitable work with The King's Trust, the human-rights attorney and the beauty mogul sat down with¬†Glamour's global editorial director Samantha Barry to discuss sisterhood, advocacy, and why showing up for women isn't a luxury, it's a legacy. The first time Amal Clooney met Charlotte Tilbury, the human rights lawyer was preparing for her wedding. Charlotte arrived at her front door heavily pregnant and wheeling five oversized suitcases of makeup. Amal blinked at the sheer theatricality of it. ‚ÄúIs all that for me?‚Äù she asked. For the renowned makeup artist, that was travelling light. By the time of the wedding, Charlotte was no longer just the makeup artist getting the bride ready‚Äîshe was an invited guest. Their connection, built on shared energy and strong maternal figures, became the beginning of something much more enduring: a sisterhood rooted in purpose, ambition, love, and a healthy dose of honesty. They come from different worlds (although as Charlotte points out, both are Aquarius with Pisces mothers)‚Äîone a decorated human rights lawyer, the other a global beauty entrepreneur. Amal has led landmark cases for women who went on to be Nobel laureates ‚Äì like Nadia Murad¬†and Maria Ressa. She has defended political prisoners, helped free journalists across continents, and shaped justice systems from Myanmar to The Hague. As cofounder of the Clooney Foundation for Justice with her husband, actor and director, George Clooney, she has now created a global network that provides free legal representation to thousands of women and girls around the world and helped free dozens of journalists who have been imprisoned for their speech. Charlotte has built a bona fide beauty empire valued at over $1 billion, was the first makeup artist to receive an MBE‚Äîmember of the Order of the British Empire, an honour awarded by the monarch for a particular achievement‚Äîand is a definitive staple in makeup bags for millions of people across the globe. I've known both women for years. Amal and I have been close friends since our single days in London, when I was working as a television producer for the BBC and Amal was already a phenomenal legal mind working as a barrister at law firm Doughty Street Chambers. I met Charlotte at Amal's wedding, where the sparkle on her eye shadow was rivalled only by her energy on the dance floor. Since then I've followed their work and their life paths. On a sunny June morning, I sit with both women in Amal's English country home to do more than just catch up‚Äîto discuss empowering initiatives that are dear to them both. Amal and Charlotte have just been at Buckingham Palace where they've used their friendship as a launchpad for real impact via their work with¬†The King's Trust, a charitable organisation founded by King Charles III (then Prince Charles) in 1976. It was renamed from The Prince's Trust in 2024 and focuses on providing young people who are facing challenges with mentorship, funding, job training, and skill building. Both Amal and Charlotte have spent the last four years mentoring and uplifting young women from around the world‚ÄîKenya, Pakistan, India‚Äîmany of whom are survivors of poverty, forced marriage, or systemic violence. The award created by the Trust in Amal's name honors one extraordinary young woman each year, while Charlotte hosts hands-on workshops to teach entrepreneurship and confidence. And then there are the Albie Awards, hosted by the Clooney Foundation for Justice‚Äîan annual event that shines a spotlight on the unsung heroes who are fighting for justice: journalists, advocates, and human rights defenders risking their lives for truth. Charlotte is not only a sponsor but truly committed to the vision. This fall the Albies will take place in London for the first time at the city's National History Museum. Amal's kitchen table, where we settled in to do our interview, still held the remains of breakfast. There were updates about children, requests for tea and Coca-Cola, and gentle teasing. Amal's husband, George, popped in and out‚Äîalways charming, always supportive, joking about his rival photo shoot taking place in the garden. This is a friendship that glows with love and joy, but it's also girded by hard work, deep trust, and shared mission. There is fun , yes, but also courtroom advocacy, cross-continental mentorship, and real-time strategy over WhatsApp. It's women who understand that showing up for one another isn't a luxury, it's a legacy. Samantha Barry: Let's go back to that first meeting between you two. What do you both remember? Amal Clooney:¬†When Charlotte showed up at my door with all those suitcases, I was aghast. I was like, ‚ÄúAre you going to need all of those products?‚Äù But I loved her energy and we got on so well. Charlotte Tilbury:¬†I fell in love with Amal because she's such an inspiration. And I met her mother Baria, too; she's actually helped me when I had to go and do TV interviews. I think all the women in her family are actually very inspirational. I mean, Amal obviously is a major champion of empowerment of women around the world. You're an inspiration to all and to me. Amal:¬†Well, can I just say I feel the same about you because I'm always so proud, because I think people meet Charlotte and they see this really attractive, bubbly, friendly, really down-to-earth person. And I'm always keen to point out, ‚ÄúBy the way, she's one of the most successful female entrepreneurs to ever come out of the United Kingdom.‚Äù Amal, this weekend you talked about George in such a beautiful way. Can you share what he means to your work? Amal:¬†I have a partner in life who is so supportive of what I do. So I don't feel like I have to apologize for it or rein it in. And I remember when I became a mom, which was obviously a new frontier, he was the first one to say, ‚ÄúI know you've got this speech at the Security Council. You have to go, I've got the kids, don't worry about it.‚Äù...","In honour of their charitable work with The King's Trust, the human-rights attorney and the beauty mogul sat down with Glamour's global editorial director Samantha Barry to discuss sisterhood, advocacy, and why showing up for women isn't a luxury, it's a legacy.

Amal and I have been close friends since our single days in London, when I was working as a television producer for the BBC and Amal was already a phenomenal legal mind working as a barrister at law firm Doughty Street Chambers. I met Charlotte at Amal's wedding, where the sparkle on her eye shadow was rivalled only by her energy on the dance floor. Since then I've followed their work and their life paths. On a sunny June morning, I sit with both women in Amal's English country home to do more than just catch up‚Äîto discuss empowering initiatives that are dear to them both. Amal and Charlotte have just been at Buckingham Palace where they've used their friendship as a launchpad for real impact via their work with The King's Trust, a charitable organisation founded by King Charles III (then Prince Charles) in 1976. It was renamed from The Prince's Trust in 2024 and focuses on providing young people who are facing challenges with mentorship, funding, job training, and skill building. Both Amal and Charlotte have spent the last four years mentoring and uplifting young women from around the world‚ÄîKenya, Pakistan, India‚Äîmany of whom are survivors of poverty, forced marriage, or systemic violence. The award created by the Trust in Amal's name honors one extraordinary young woman each year, while Charlotte hosts hands-on workshops to teach entrepreneurship and confidence. And then there are the Albie Awards, hosted by the Clooney Foundation for Justice‚Äîan annual event that shines a spotlight on the unsung heroes who are fighting for justice: journalists, advocates, and human rights defenders risking their lives for truth. Charlotte is not only a sponsor but truly committed to the vision. This fall the Albies will take place in London for the first time at the city's National History Museum. Amal's kitchen table, where we settled in to do our interview, still held the remains of breakfast. There were updates about children, requests for tea and Coca-Cola, and gentle teasing. Amal's husband, George, popped in and out‚Äîalways charming, always supportive, joking about his rival photo shoot taking place in the garden. This is a friendship that glows with love and joy, but it's also girded by hard work, deep trust, and shared mission. There is fun , yes, but also courtroom advocacy, cross-continental mentorship, and real-time strategy over WhatsApp. It's women who understand that showing up for one another isn't a luxury, it's a legacy. Samantha Barry: Let's go back to that first meeting between you two. What do you both remember? Amal Clooney: When Charlotte showed up at my door with all those suitcases, I was aghast. I was like, ‚ÄúAre you going to need all of those products?‚Äù But I loved her energy and we got on so well. Charlotte Tilbury: I fell in love with Amal because she's such an inspiration. And I met her mother Baria, too; she's actually helped me when I had to go and do TV interviews. I think all the women in her family are actually very inspirational. I mean, Amal obviously is a major champion of empowerment of women around the world. You're an inspiration to all and to me. Amal: Well, can I just say I feel the same about you because I'm always so proud, because I think people meet Charlotte and they see this really attractive, bubbly, friendly, really down-to-earth person. And I'm always keen to point out, ‚ÄúBy the way, she's one of the most successful female entrepreneurs to ever come out of the United Kingdom.‚Äù Amal, this weekend you talked about George in such a beautiful way. Can you share what he means to your work? Amal: I have a partner in life who is so supportive of what I do. So I don't feel like I have to apologize for it or rein it in. And I remember when I became a mom, which was obviously a new frontier, he was the first one to say, ‚ÄúI know you've got this speech at the Security Council. You have to go, I've got the kids, don't worry about it.‚Äù...",2025-07-03 13:09:18,en,WEB,,,,,False,1,False,False,,,This is a detailed article about Charlotte Tilbury and Amal Clooney's friendship and charitable work.

mov_3DB2B71E315E1E218D558EECD33BF5BF,"‚Äâ SPR_COMBO[de]Eines der gr√∂√üten Sch√∂nheitsunternehmen der Welt ist Berichten zufolge einen Verkauf von sich selbst. Anfang Juni berichtete WWD, dass Coty erw√§gt, seine Verbraucher- und Prestige-Divisionen zu ver√§u√üern, darunter einige der bekanntesten Marken von Beauty wie Covergirl sowie Chlo√©- und Hugo-Chef-Parfums. Die Ank√ºndigung versetzte den Aktienkurs von Coty 13 Prozent auf 5 USD; Die Ver√§u√üerung beider Waffen w√ºrde im Wesentlichen mehr als 120 Jahre als Unternehmen beendet. Coty lehnte es ab, sich zu dem Bericht zu √§u√üern. Trotz seiner Gr√∂√üe und Stall bekannter Namen hat das amerikanische Konglomerat in den letzten Jahren Schwierigkeiten, mit seinen Konkurrenten Schritt zu halten. Innerhalb des Portfolios seines gr√∂√üten Anteilseigners Jab Holdings ist Coty das schlechteste Kapital und senkt den Ausblick im letzten Gesch√§ftsjahr, wobei weitere Umsatzr√ºckg√§nge projiziert werden. Coty hat versucht, sein Ansehen zu verbessern. Seit seinem derzeitigen CEO Sue Nabi im Jahr 2020 eintraf, hat das Unternehmen das Fett getrimmt und nicht-Kernmarken wie Professional Lines Wella und OPI abgebrochen. Aber es bleibt immer noch seine √§u√üeren Kollegen wie L'Or√©al und Elf Beauty zur√ºck, und im Mai verkaufte es Skkn von Kim, der Prestige-Hautpflegemarke, an seinen Gr√ºnder zur√ºck, den Multi-Hyphenate-Reality-Star Kim Kardashian und ihre Bekleidungsfirma Skims, nachdem die Marke vers√§umt hatte, mit Schaufenster f√ºr Furore zu machen. Die Kerngesch√§fte, Duft- und Drogerie -Make -up, stehen ebenfalls unter Druck. W√§hrend der Duft die kategorische Kategorie der Branche ist und Coty einige der weltweit bekanntesten D√ºfte der Welt herstellt, ist der heftig wettbewerbsf√§hige Sektor mit neuen Herausforderern gef√ºllt. Die Bem√ºhungen, das Summen wie trendige K√∂rpermists f√ºr Calvin Klein und die Wiederbelebung von Marc Jacobs Beauty zu f√∂rdern, sind in einem von Nischenspieler und Tiktok -Viralit√§t dominierten Markt ein R√ºckgang des Ozeans. Die Drogerie -Marken haben ebenfalls unterdurchschnittlich geschafft. ‚ÄúSo ziemlich alles in der Messe hat nicht funktioniert ‚Ä¶ Ich gebe ihnen viel Anerkennung daf√ºr, dass sie kreativ sind und Dinge ausprobieren‚Äù, sagte Lauren Lieberman, Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer bei Barclays Consumer Practice, in der Bem√ºhungen zur Wiederbelebung von Covergirl. Sie bemerkte auch die ged√§mpfte Wiederbelebung der Philosophie, die Hautpflege und die Bade- und K√∂rperlinie, die ein gro√üer Erfolg in den Aughts sowie die Sun Care Line Lancaster war. Mit dem R√ºcktritt von Jab Holdings 'langj√§hriger Vorsitzender Peter Harb im April wird neue F√ºhrung wahrscheinlich f√ºr ein neues Denken bereit sein. Wenn Coty versucht, K√§ufer von Gerichts zu nehmen, sind potenzielle Bieter schlank und w√ºrden wahrscheinlich in einige ausgew√§hlte Kategorien fallen. bricht zusammen, wer interessiert sein k√∂nnte ‚Äì und warum ‚Äì unten. Die Kronjuwelen Prestige -Duft bleibt Cotys hei√üeste Eigenschaft. Es enth√§lt langfristige Lizenzen f√ºr Chlo√©, Gucci, Hugo-Chef und Calvin Klein, einige der ber√ºhmtesten Modeh√§user der Welt. Hugo -Chef wird als die gr√∂√üte Marke des Unternehmens angesehen, die rund 10 Prozent oder rund 585 Millionen US -Dollar in H√∂he von rund 9 Prozent und 7 Prozent des Gesamtumsatzes des Unternehmens umfasst. Dies sind w√ºnschenswerte Verm√∂genswerte, selbst mit intensiver Konkurrenz durch Inseln auf dem Weg. Diese D√ºfte des Modehaus sind weit verbreitet, bekannt und haben ein integriertes Prestige und Dynamik. Ein Spezialist f√ºr Duftlizenzspezialist wie Interphlum, das f√ºr Lacoste und Anna Sui Parfums herstellt, k√∂nnte theoretisch interessiert sein. Seit 2022 hat es DKNY wiederbelebt und die Linie neu anspricht, nachdem LVMH sie an die G-III-Gruppe, ein Modeportfoliounternehmen, abgeladen hatte. Das spanische Konglomerat Puig k√∂nnte auch ein Anw√§rter sein; W√§hrend es sein Vertrauen in die Lizenzierung verringert hat und sich stattdessen auf den Besitz von Marken ver√§ndert hat, nachdem sie Byredo und Charlotte Tilbury aufgenommen haben, verwaltet es geschickt √§hnliche Modehaus-Duftmarken wie Carolina Herrera und Jean-Paul Gaultier und k√∂nnte dazu beitragen, dass die Marken frische Energie injizieren k√∂nnten. Mode -Lizenzunternehmen wie Tapestry, PVH Corp oder Capri k√∂nnten auch daran interessiert sein, ihre Best√§nde zu diversifizieren und dem Mix Sch√∂nheit zu verleihen, insbesondere f√ºr bew√§hrte Linien wie Burberry und Calvin Klein, von denen letztere das Modegesch√§ft besitzt. Der Luxusmarken ' Mutterunternehmen m√∂chten m√∂glicherweise auch ihre Sch√∂nheitsangebote wieder in Haus bringen. Der Gucci-Besitzer Kering hat kein Geheimnis aus seinen lauwartigen Gef√ºhlen gegen√ºber der Gucci-Sch√∂nheitsmarke unter Cotys Besitz, die 2028 abl√§uft, kein Geheimnis gemacht, und Kering hat jetzt eine interne Sch√∂nheitsabteilung mit Creed. LVMH, dem Marc Jacobs geh√∂rt, hat sich als Expertise in Beauty bew√§hrt und Sch√∂nheitsangebote wie Dior und Guerlain verwaltet. ‚ÄûDie Tatsache, dass Coty gedauert hat [as a company] So lange ist, weil Duft ein so gro√üartiges Gesch√§ft ist ‚Äú, sagte Lieberman. In j√ºngerer Zeit beginnen Unternehmen wie LVMH und KERING ihre eigenen Sch√∂nheitswaffen oder konsolidieren ihre Bem√ºhungen auf andere Weise. Lieberman sagte, andere Firmen wie Puig oder Fashion Lizenzierh√§user k√∂nnten alle logische Bieter sein, aber das Reiben ist, dass Cotys F√§higkeit, diese Lizenzen zu verkaufen, nicht eindeutig ist. Abh√§ngig von der Art der unterzeichneten urspr√ºnglichen Vereinbarungen k√∂nnen sie m√∂glicherweise das Eigentum an ein neues Unternehmen √ºbertragen.

Tags: PrevPrevious NextJustin Wrobleski verleiht Dodgers beim Sieg √ºberraschend einen √ºberraschenden SchubNext","SPR_COMBO[de]Eines der gr√∂√üten Sch√∂nheitsunternehmen der Welt ist Berichten zufolge einen Verkauf von sich selbst. Anfang Juni berichtete WWD, dass Coty erw√§gt, seine Verbraucher- und Prestige-Divisionen zu ver√§u√üern, darunter einige der bekanntesten Marken von Beauty wie Covergirl sowie Chlo√©- und Hugo-Chef-Parfums. Die Ank√ºndigung versetzte den Aktienkurs von Coty 13 Prozent auf 5 USD; Die Ver√§u√üerung beider Waffen w√ºrde im Wesentlichen mehr als 120 Jahre als Unternehmen beendet. Coty lehnte es ab, sich zu dem Bericht zu √§u√üern. Trotz seiner Gr√∂√üe und Stall bekannter Namen hat das amerikanische Konglomerat in den letzten Jahren Schwierigkeiten, mit seinen Konkurrenten Schritt zu halten. Innerhalb des Portfolios seines gr√∂√üten Anteilseigners Jab Holdings ist Coty das schlechteste Kapital und senkt den Ausblick im letzten Gesch√§ftsjahr, wobei weitere Umsatzr√ºckg√§nge projiziert werden. Coty hat versucht, sein Ansehen zu verbessern. Seit seinem derzeitigen CEO Sue Nabi im Jahr 2020 eintraf, hat das Unternehmen das Fett getrimmt und nicht-Kernmarken wie Professional Lines Wella und OPI abgebrochen. Aber es bleibt immer noch seine √§u√üeren Kollegen wie L'Or√©al und Elf Beauty zur√ºck, und im Mai verkaufte es Skkn von Kim, der Prestige-Hautpflegemarke, an seinen Gr√ºnder zur√ºck, den Multi-Hyphenate-Reality-Star Kim Kardashian und ihre Bekleidungsfirma Skims, nachdem die Marke vers√§umt hatte, mit Schaufenster f√ºr Furore zu machen. Die Kerngesch√§fte, Duft- und Drogerie -Make -up, stehen ebenfalls unter Druck. W√§hrend der Duft die kategorische Kategorie der Branche ist und Coty einige der weltweit bekanntesten D√ºfte der Welt herstellt, ist der heftig wettbewerbsf√§hige Sektor mit neuen Herausforderern gef√ºllt. Die Bem√ºhungen, das Summen wie trendige K√∂rpermists f√ºr Calvin Klein und die Wiederbelebung von Marc Jacobs Beauty zu f√∂rdern, sind in einem von Nischenspieler und Tiktok -Viralit√§t dominierten Markt ein R√ºckgang des Ozeans. Die Drogerie -Marken haben ebenfalls unterdurchschnittlich geschafft. ‚ÄúSo ziemlich alles in der Messe hat nicht funktioniert ‚Ä¶ Ich gebe ihnen viel Anerkennung daf√ºr, dass sie kreativ sind und Dinge ausprobieren‚Äù, sagte Lauren Lieberman, Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer bei Barclays Consumer Practice, in der Bem√ºhungen zur Wiederbelebung von Covergirl. Sie bemerkte auch die ged√§mpfte Wiederbelebung der Philosophie, die Hautpflege und die Bade- und K√∂rperlinie, die ein gro√üer Erfolg in den Aughts sowie die Sun Care Line Lancaster war. Mit dem R√ºcktritt von Jab Holdings 'langj√§hriger Vorsitzender Peter Harb im April wird neue F√ºhrung wahrscheinlich f√ºr ein neues Denken bereit sein. Wenn Coty versucht, K√§ufer von Gerichts zu nehmen, sind potenzielle Bieter schlank und w√ºrden wahrscheinlich in einige ausgew√§hlte Kategorien fallen. bricht zusammen, wer interessiert sein k√∂nnte ‚Äì und warum ‚Äì unten. Die Kronjuwelen Prestige -Duft bleibt Cotys hei√üeste Eigenschaft. Es enth√§lt langfristige Lizenzen f√ºr Chlo√©, Gucci, Hugo-Chef und Calvin Klein, einige der ber√ºhmtesten Modeh√§user der Welt. Hugo -Chef wird als die gr√∂√üte Marke des Unternehmens angesehen, die rund 10 Prozent oder rund 585 Millionen US -Dollar in H√∂he von rund 9 Prozent und 7 Prozent des Gesamtumsatzes des Unternehmens umfasst. Dies sind w√ºnschenswerte Verm√∂genswerte, selbst mit intensiver Konkurrenz durch Inseln auf dem Weg. Diese D√ºfte des Modehaus sind weit verbreitet, bekannt und haben ein integriertes Prestige und Dynamik. Ein Spezialist f√ºr Duftlizenzspezialist wie Interphlum, das f√ºr Lacoste und Anna Sui Parfums herstellt, k√∂nnte theoretisch interessiert sein. Seit 2022 hat es DKNY wiederbelebt und die Linie neu anspricht, nachdem LVMH sie an die G-III-Gruppe, ein Modeportfoliounternehmen, abgeladen hatte. Das spanische Konglomerat Puig k√∂nnte auch ein Anw√§rter sein; W√§hrend es sein Vertrauen in die Lizenzierung verringert hat und sich stattdessen auf den Besitz von Marken ver√§ndert hat, nachdem sie Byredo und Charlotte Tilbury aufgenommen haben, verwaltet es geschickt √§hnliche Modehaus-Duftmarken wie Carolina Herrera und Jean-Paul Gaultier und k√∂nnte dazu beitragen, dass die Marken frische Energie injizieren k√∂nnten. Mode -Lizenzunternehmen wie Tapestry, PVH Corp oder Capri k√∂nnten auch daran interessiert sein, ihre Best√§nde zu diversifizieren und dem Mix Sch√∂nheit zu verleihen, insbesondere f√ºr bew√§hrte Linien wie Burberry und Calvin Klein, von denen letztere das Modegesch√§ft besitzt. Der Luxusmarken ' Mutterunternehmen m√∂chten m√∂glicherweise auch ihre Sch√∂nheitsangebote wieder in Haus bringen. Der Gucci-Besitzer Kering hat kein Geheimnis aus seinen lauwartigen Gef√ºhlen gegen√ºber der Gucci-Sch√∂nheitsmarke unter Cotys Besitz, die 2028 abl√§uft, kein Geheimnis gemacht, und Kering hat jetzt eine interne Sch√∂nheitsabteilung mit Creed. LVMH, dem Marc Jacobs geh√∂rt, hat sich als Expertise in Beauty bew√§hrt und Sch√∂nheitsangebote wie Dior und Guerlain verwaltet. ‚ÄûDie Tatsache, dass Coty gedauert hat [as a company] So lange ist, weil Duft ein so gro√üartiges Gesch√§ft ist ‚Äú, sagte Lieberman. In j√ºngerer Zeit beginnen Unternehmen wie LVMH und KERING ihre eigenen Sch√∂nheitswaffen oder konsolidieren ihre Bem√ºhungen auf andere Weise. Lieberman sagte, andere Firmen wie Puig oder Fashion Lizenzierh√§user k√∂nnten alle logische Bieter sein, aber das Reiben ist, dass Cotys F√§higkeit, diese Lizenzen zu verkaufen, nicht eindeutig ist. Abh√§ngig von der Art der unterzeichneten urspr√ºnglichen Vereinbarungen k√∂nnen sie m√∂glicherweise das Eigentum an ein neues Unternehmen √ºbertragen.

Touchland Power Mist hydrating hand sanitizer spray trio (30% off list price) Whether you're traveling this summer or simply moving through life, there are plenty of places that we frequent that can get pretty germy, making hand sanitizer a daily essential. The Touchland Power Mist Hydrating hand sanitizer is a great option that not only contains 70% alcohol to kill germs but is infused with nourishing skin care ingredients like aloe vera and lemon essential oil to keep your skin from drying out. L'Or√©al Lumi Glotion (41% off list price) We've formally called L'Oreal's Lumi Glotion the perfect shortcut to perfect skin and one of the most convincing alternatives to the famed Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter.

In the past, the 83-year-old has revealed some of the professional treatments she's received, the at-home face mask she swears by and the tinted sunscreen she relies on. Her skin-care routine isn't exactly cheap, but one affordable product she uses before applying makeup is L'Oreal True Match Lumi Glotion.

However, you can save yourself six bucks right now and achieve similar results as the domestic diva ‚Äî win-win! Why do I need this? On her website, Martha revealed the 14 beauty products she ""swears by,"" and this glow-enhancing priming lotion is near the top of the list. Her trusted makeup artist of many years, Daisy Toye, said she applies it to Martha's face after SPF to add dewiness and create ""a smooth canvas for makeup."" Infused with glycerin and shea butter, the lotion aims to hydrate and moisturize skin while enhancing its natural glow. The multitasker can be worn on its own for a natural look or as a primer under foundation if you prefer more coverage. You can also use it to contour your face by applying it to specific areas. It's available in five shades and can be used on your body too.

Pros ""I've been using this product for seven months, and I've been complimented almost weekly about how I get my skin to look so dewy and glowy,"" raved one longtime fan. ""I use this all over with a good coverage foundation, and I've never felt/looked so sun-kissed. Such an amazing product for a killer price!"" ""I'm 70 and each time I've worn it, someone has said I looked 'good' or one time I looked 'fresh,'"" shared a content customer. ""This cream adds a subtle shine to your skin. I can barely see it, but it seems to reflect light. I would say people are just being nice, but it has only happened when I've specifically worn this cream."" Others tried it after seeing Martha's seal of approval. ""I heard that this was one of Martha's low-cost beauty secrets ... I've been looking for something that could give me a little sparkle and pop, and this did both,"" said a five-star reviewer. ""Goes on light and has no scent, lasts all day, and I use it with my regular foundation. Love it so much! Gives me a glow that I've been looking for and very natural looking as well!"" Some call this an affordable alternative for Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Filter ‚Äî it's just a fraction of the price. ""This really is my favorite stuff in my makeup bag. ... It's a nice subtle glow, but also buildable. Looks good alone or under makeup if you need more coverage. I get compliments every time I wear it alone. It's just beautiful,"" said a fan, adding that they think it's ""better than Charlotte Tilbury. I have both and haven't reached for C.T. since purchasing this."" Cons A few reviewers say they had to pair this lotion with powder or other makeup to tone down the shine. ""I absolutely hate wearing foundation, and this is the perfect substitute,"" said one. ""It still gives me some color but doesn't feel like I have anything on! Only complaint is it does give me a little too much shine on my forehead where I'm already shiny, but some powder on top helps reduce the dew."" A final shopper said they wish the brand carried more shades. ""Medium is very hard to find, so if you see it, grab it,"" they said, adding that their ""only complaint is the limited shade range.""

""It still gives me some color but doesn't feel like I have anything on! Only complaint is it does give me a little too much shine on my forehead where I'm already shiny, but some powder on top helps reduce the dew."" A final shopper said they wish the brand carried more shades. ""Medium is very hard to find, so if you see it, grab it,"" they said, adding that their ""only complaint is the limited shade range.""

Und das ist das Lippen√∂l Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oil Strawberry Vanilla! Inhalt: Das Lippen√∂l enth√§lt hydratisierenden Hyalurons√§ure sowie antioxidantreichen Frucht√∂le um feine Linien zu gl√§tten und f√ºr pralle Lippen zu sorgen. Der Appliktor ist extra gebogen, so dass er m√ºhelos √ºber die Lippen gleitet. Verpackung/Design: Das Lippen√∂l ist einer rosafarbenen Schachtel verpackt. Auf dieser sind schon passend zum Duft Erdbeeren abgebildet! Nach dem Auspacken h√§lt man eine rosafarbene Tube in der Hand. Darauf sind auch Erdbeeren sowie Lippen abgebildet mit einer goldenen Kappe. Ich finde das Design total sch√∂n und ansprechend gestaltet! Duft: Zuerst musste ich nat√ºrlich schnuppern: der Duft ist etwas s√º√ülich, es duftet nach Erdbeere, nur Vanille kann ich nicht so heraus riechen. F√ºr mich duftet es ein bisschen wie nach einer leckeren Erdbeertorte. Ich k√∂nnte das Lippen√∂l glatt vernaschen! Anwendung: Durch den gebogenen Applikator l√§sst sich das Lippen√∂l viel besser auf meinen Lippen auftragen und verteilen! Ergebnis: Das Lippen√∂l hat nur einen sehr leichten r√∂tlichen Farbton, aber es sorgt f√ºr einen sch√∂nen Glanz. Und meine Lippen wirken auch voller! Meine Lippen f√ºhlen sich sch√∂n weich und geschmeidig an. Sie sind auch nicht mehr so trocken. Das Lippen√∂l ist schlie√ülich gleichzeitig auch eine gute Lippenpflege! Die Haltbarkeit ist richtig gut: nach dem Auftragen habe ich ein paar Mal was getrunken und das weiche Gef√ºhl des Lippen√∂ls blieb! Auch fast eine ganze Mahlzeit hielt das Lippen√∂l durch. Mein Fazit: Ich bin total verliebt in das neue Lippen√∂l von Charlotte Tilbury. Der Erdbeerduft ist himmlisch sch√∂n und das Lippen√∂l h√§lt unglaublich lange!
