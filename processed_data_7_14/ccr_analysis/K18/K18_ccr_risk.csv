n1872a7,"â€‰ Hi, pro here. The ingredients are not the same. If you put a bit of store bought shampoo in your palm can you turn it upside down? It boils down to the ph balance on what makes hair products professional or not truly. I am not personally a fan of sulfate free products. I like the active cleaning agents/bubbles. However; I will say Pantene is the worst for your hair. It has wax in it. You can literally wax your floors with it. Long term use causes a waxy build up that I've personally cut off of peoples hair shaft. It's awful and can cause much bigger issues. I can wash someone's hair and tell if they use it (often). K18 and Olaplex can be good. However, too much protein can cause breakage and frizz, you don't need it that often unless it's very damaged. Using professional products correctly is the key. Some people aren't educated in the type of hair they have and actual products or frequency of use. I should also mention, there's a lot of fakes and expired products sold with really good packaging. Unless it's sold in a professional salon (not Amazon or a grocery store) there isn't a guarantee you're actually getting the correct product. Just a food for thought from someone who's been in the industry over 20 years. Best wishes.","Hi, pro here. The ingredients are not the same.
