pick up a nice serum too to keep the mids/ends healthy. if you can't invest in these products, i promise your hair would look better at whatever color it is now than lighter and unhealthy! but i think if you invest in the bond builder from sally's, k18, and a bond repairing shampoo and conditioner, your goal example is within reach. also not sure what your current base color is like or if you've done a whole head lightening process before, but make sure you understand how to apply the lightener for a whole head application so you don't end up with an uneven base color before you go back in to highlight. if you don't apply the lightener correctly you will end up with really uneven color — lighter roots from the heat of your head accelerating the bleach, etc. here is a good video that explains how to approach whole head lightening — as with the other example video, don't focus on the end result color, just pay attention to the techniques used to achieve an even color. adjust the processing times according to your goal base color: saw that you don't have sally's in your country. there are other products similar to olaplex; see if you can find ALL hd PLEX or LIW ph plex! i think you'd need to order them online. they are both similar products you will mix into the bleach and color during the color/lightening processes. this step is definitely the most important",2025-07-01 18:46:14,en,REDDIT,,,,,False,1,False,False,,,"The comment is a detailed, technical discussion about hair coloring techniques and product recommendations.

1lpdd6c,"  Does anyone actually feel like bond repair actually made a drastic difference ? I recently started using k18 leave in mask and it feels strange not using conditioner. I'm afraid of protein build up and I'm just wondering if this is going to backfire. I have fine hair that I recently dyed with a Demi to get to my natural brunette color. I have felt like my hair has felt pretty dry and brittle. I had mostly virgin hair before I dyed it with maybe 1/4 at the bottom being left over balayage. I got scared that I was just depriving my hair of the moisture process by skipping actual conditioner by using k18 leave in mask. I only spent $30 on the mini so I'm okay to give up on it if it's just not realistic or meant for me. I'm just curious what other people's experience have been with bond repair. I use Kevin Murphy products, this is the first time in years I've been dealing with hair that feels so dry.

1lphmey,"  Hello, I have done a lot to my hair over the years and about two years ago I got my hair totally fried off by a stylist! So I covered it with black box dye as a natural blonde… I have had it for about 2 years, only touching up the roots with black every month or so. It's definitely healthy in my opinion and I have used lots of k18 and redken acidic bonding etc. I decided I was done with black and got two color removers (color zap) and my hair lifted a lot actually! I would say it's more of an auburn color now, not super orange or red, kind of orangey brown 6/7 level. No black is left. I planned to do it all myself but got too scared and decided to book a consultation at a rlly good hair salon I like. However I am so nervous to go because my hair looks so fucking ridiculous. I'm afraid to scare my stylist, I know how difficult it is to remove black but I'm hoping to just get to brunette. My hair isn't super long and perfect and I haven't cut it in forever plus I cut my own shitty bangs😭, anyway I am embarrassed to go in there for some reason! If anyone's a hairstylist, please let me know how you would feel! I just want to finally fix my mistake professionally, but I'm just embarrassed of my orange hair…","Hello, I have done a lot to my hair over the years and about two years ago I got my hair totally fried off by a stylist!

1lr092w,"  I've been getting my hair bleached for about two years now and in the last six months or so I've noticed the hair around my hairline has become much thinner and shorter (I keep telling myself they're just baby hairs, but now I'm fearing the worst), and also the hair near my crown at the back of my head is vastly shorter than the rest of my hair. I've recently started using a hair serum and K18, and I managed to pick up some topical minoxidil at the airport the other day which I might have to resort to if all else fails. I also take the contraceptive pill and have for years if that's relevant. I'm naturally a dark blonde but have got so used to the bleached look that I'm scared to go back 😅 I've kind of accepted I might have to start wearing extensions soon if this continues, but I fear that will only make it worse in the long term. Shall I continue trying to make the dyed hair work with the serum and see if the topical minoxidil helps at all? Or shall I just ditch the bleach altogether?

n1872a7,"  Hi, pro here. The ingredients are not the same. If you put a bit of store bought shampoo in your palm can you turn it upside down? It boils down to the ph balance on what makes hair products professional or not truly. I am not personally a fan of sulfate free products. I like the active cleaning agents/bubbles. However; I will say Pantene is the worst for your hair. It has wax in it. You can literally wax your floors with it. Long term use causes a waxy build up that I've personally cut off of peoples hair shaft. It's awful and can cause much bigger issues. I can wash someone's hair and tell if they use it (often). K18 and Olaplex can be good. However, too much protein can cause breakage and frizz, you don't need it that often unless it's very damaged. Using professional products correctly is the key. Some people aren't educated in the type of hair they have and actual products or frequency of use. I should also mention, there's a lot of fakes and expired products sold with really good packaging. Unless it's sold in a professional salon (not Amazon or a grocery store) there isn't a guarantee you're actually getting the correct product. Just a food for thought from someone who's been in the industry over 20 years. Best wishes.","Hi, pro here. The ingredients are not the same.
