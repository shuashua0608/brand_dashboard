mov_17CCF83D49AE6F8199AE48EAA9C46571,"  The results of this menswear season's top 10 most-viewed shows list on are in. Every season, this list acts as a failsafe indicator of which collections have captured the attention of those who are more interested in the clothes than the front rows. As ever, the list is ordered according to the amount of views each collection logged on within its first 48 hours of publication. And as ever, this season has thrown up a few surprises. There are four new entries on the list this season, of which only one – Yves Saint Laurent – we expected to see. That reliably blockbuster show has been held outside of the mainstream menswear calendar for the last few seasons, and its in-season arrival on the Paris schedule made it an almost certainty to figure here. The three other new entries include the oldest designer on the list, the second youngest designer on the list, and the longest serving non-founder creative director in all of fashion. This season, eight of the top 10 collections were presented in Paris, with only two in Milan. That will be catnip to those who contend that Milan lacks “energy”. And only one of the collections on the list was not presented on the runway, which will cheer those who relish watching fashion theatre in its purest form. Two of the collections were debut shows for creative directors at well-established houses. And you needn't need to be a fashion clairvoyant to divine which show, this season, would be the most-viewed. Haute-bourgeois boys in leather pants plus the hottest bags in the business make Hermès an irresistible viewing pleasure for many among menswear's cognoscenti. So it's little surprise to see French luxury's most serene heritage marque sliding back into this season's top 10, making it the first of the list's new entries. And without wishing to spoil the reveal at the other end of this list, there is a satisfying symmetry to the fact that Véronique Nichanian is the longest-serving creative director in all of fashion (menswear included). Hermès SS26 Men's. Photo: Daniele Oberrauch/ Gorunway.com Second new entry Grace Wales Bonner is also the second youngest designer on this list. This season, she was presenting a collection that marked her 10th anniversary as one of the most precarious of entities in fashion: a London-based indie. In her review, my colleague Sarah Mower described as a “total disgrace” the fact that GWB has not yet been tapped to be creative director of another brand or house, and that reading is fair enough; however, another way of seeing it might be that Wales Bonner is simply too self-determined to let herself be pinned down. Her three-pronged combo of artistic practice, conscious menswear opulence and hit Adidas output seems to have generated a stable and self-sustaining business ecosystem that she's thriving in.

So even though Van Noten hand-picked Julian Klausner to succeed him as creative director of the brand, the stakes at this menswear debut were as high as that fanbase's expectations. Before the show, I spoke to a few bench buddies who were, like me, a little trepidatious on his behalf: last season's menswear lookbook (a sort of holding collection as Klausner warmed his seat) seemed rather a narrow vision of this most expansive of design visions. Cometh the hour, however, Klausner delivered: this was a dreamily Dries-ian collection, but it also felt tangibly distinct — a favourite dish in a long-favourite restaurant cooked by a freshly promoted and talented chef.

That factor, plus the sheer enormity of this collection, might both have contributed to Mr Armani's return to the most-viewed menswear list this season. And yet, this designer — who at just shy of 91 years old remains the sole shareholder in a company he founded 50 years ago next month — more than merits the eyeballs. He is the singular author of his own utterly distinct dialect of fashion classicism, and despite his half-century of service, he continues to find variations on that dialect that are both surprising and subtle.

But in my opinion, the inclusion in this list of a lookbook-delivered collection of which more than 60 per cent of the images (by my quick count) relate to womenswear resort rather than to menswear Spring/Summer 2026 is, at best, a margin call. Still, it's also our margin call. Its place here on behalf of a collection presentation at which the ever observant Amy Verner highlighted the Julian Schnabel clothing rack upon which a pyjama set was displayed, is a powerful testament to the enigmatic magnetism of a brand that is both discreet and discrete.

The singer, who recently performed at the Glastonbury Festival, watched as Grand Slam champion Aryna Sabalenka defeated Marie Bouzkova of Czechia. For the tennis Grand Slam tournament, Rodrigo gave a nod to English style sensibility in a red and white gingham dress. Her vintage Ralph Lauren dress, courtesy of the spring 2000 collection, featured short sleeves and a sharp collar with white buttons running down the front placket of the frock. The red and white checkered patterned was reminiscent of the color scheme from one of Wimbledon's most popular treats — strawberries and cream. Rodrigo paired the dress with a coordinated red Khaite bag, complementing her attire's color scheme. She accessorized with a pair of Karen Wazen sunglasses. For his part, Patridge opted for suited attire, echoing the formal nature and extensive history of Wimbledon's atmosphere. The actor wore a navy blue blazer with a white and blue pinstripe shirt and a burgundy tie with yellow stripes. Patridge also accessorized with sunglasses. The couple has been in a relationship since the fall of 2023. Rodrigo's gingham-clad look for Wimbledon is a departure from the “Drivers License” singer's on-stage aesthetic. While performing at Glastonbury on Sunday, she styled a lingerie-inspired minidress with frilly white lace elements and corsetry on the bodice. Last October, Rodrigo wore a design courtesy of Ludovic de Saint Sernin's spring 2025 collection for her appearance on “The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.” The sleeveless minidress featured a body-con red leather design, embellished with a bevy of metallic rings forming interlinked horizontal stripes. Rodrigo is just one of many celebrities who have attended the 2025 edition of Wimbledon thus far. On Tuesday, Cate Blanchett attended the grand slam tennis tournament in a suited look with Prince of Wales patterning courtesy of Giorgio Armani.

mov_2CCEF76AD199EDB8C9E6E24FF8B7DBCB,"  1. Rise in Fashion Industry Enforcement as Green Claims Directive Stalls In recent years, legislative initiatives have increasingly reflected the green agenda and sustainability objectives of the European Commission (the Commission). Authorities have been paying closer attention to unfair commercial practices, including the dissemination of inaccurate corporate responsibility disclosures and false or exaggerated environmental claims. The fashion industry has emerged as a key focus area, with national agencies across Europe intensifying efforts to investigate greenwashing, deceptive labeling, and misleading ethical assertions, especially concerning labour practices. In the past month or so, two pivotal developments unfolded: The first one took place on 25 May 2025, when the Commission formally joined forces with several national competition authorities in urging the online fashion giant SHEIN to comply with EU consumer protection laws. The request followed a coordinated investigation that uncovered suspected fake discounts, manipulation of reviews and ratings, deceptive product labels, and misleading sustainability claims. This joint enforcement action complements a separate, ongoing Commission investigation under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The DSA imposes heightened due diligence obligations aimed at ensuring transparency and consumer trust in digital markets on very large online platforms (VLOPs), and SHEIN was designated a VLOP in April 2024. The second development occurred just last week, when the Commission announced - and later clarified - its intention to withdraw support for the Green Claims Directive (GCD) unless the Council's proposed amendment to include 30 million micro-enterprises within its scope was removed. Micro-enterprises are defined as companies with fewer than 10 employees and less than €2 million in revenue. Originally unveiled in March 2023, the GCD aimed to protect consumers from misleading environmental marketing by requiring companies to have their green claims independently verified. The final text of the Directive had been expected imminently. The Commission's reversal is formally grounded in concerns that the Directive, as amended, would impose a disproportionate administrative burden on small businesses. At the same time, there is growing concern that the GCD's stringent requirements could inadvertently discourage companies from communicating their environmental efforts—a phenomenon known as 'greenhushing'—or worse, deter them from pursuing sustainability initiatives altogether. The uncertainty surrounding the future of the GCD should not be interpreted, without more, as a rollback of the EU's broader sustainability agenda. Rather than signaling a retreat from environmental regulation, the Commission's recent move reflects a recalibration of scope and priorities. It is now up to the co-legislators to consider the Commission's position and renegotiate the Directive's scope. Importantly, the rest of the EU's green regulatory framework—including measures targeting greenwashing—remains intact and continues to advance. We recall that just last year, the Commission adopted two key green directives that embed sustainability into the EU's regulatory fabric. The first is designed to empower consumers during the green transition, strengthening safeguards against unfair commercial practices and ensuring access to reliable, verifiable product information. The second introduces more robust requirements around corporate sustainability reporting, reinforcing transparency and accountability. Member states have until next year to transpose both directives into national law, after which enforcement — particularly around deceptive green claims — is expected to intensify. 2. Reform Milestones As consumer scrutiny of ethical and environmental claims intensifies, the EU has rolled out a series of landmark policies targeting greenwashing, unethical labour practices, and digital consumer risks — particularly in high-impact sectors like fashion. Here is how the regulatory landscape has evolved in recent years: 3. Overview of Investigations Targeting Greenwashing and Unfair Practices Across Europe and the UK EU Investigates SHEIN and Temu Over Online Practices and Consumer Risks The Commission's recent enforcement action against SHEIN underscores the importance and gravity the EU attaches to greenwashing, false ethical claims, and other unfair practices. In this particular case, the Commission is investigating a variety of other SHEIN practices, which range from the presence of illegal goods and content on its platform to the opacity of its recommender system that influences the range of products recommended to users first, through a parallel, complementary DSA inquiry. The Commission has also asked the retailer to provide information on the measures adopted to mitigate risks relating to consumer protection, public health, users' well-being, and the processing of data. Another Chinese e-commerce giant, Temu, received a similar request for information, at the same time as SHEIN, after receipt of a consumer complaint alleging that the exponential increase in Temu's user base is the result of aggressive marketing that may violate EU consumer protection laws, notably articles 7, 34, 35, 38, and 40 of the DSA. The company is under investigation for failure to ensure traceability of those trading on the platform; lack of transparency; and insufficient measures to protect minors and mitigate the risks stemming from the service's allegedly addictive design and illegal product listings. The Dutch Authorities Rigorously Pursue Greenwashing In 2023, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) updated its guidelines on sustainability claims, introducing stricter requirements around clarity, accuracy, and specificity. This followed a wave of enforcement activity that began in 2022, when the ACM launched investigations into corporate green claims across the fashion sector. It concluded that Decathlon and H&M had made vague or misleading sustainability statements. Both companies committed to revising their labeling and online messaging practices and agreed to donate to sustainability causes as partial remediation for their lack of transparency. The ACM also took part in a broader European enforcement initiative examining SHEIN's environmental and ethical claims. Separately, in 2023, the Dutch Advertising Code Committee investigated a greenwashing complaint against Primark, further highlighting regulators' growing focus on sustainability messaging in the fashion industry. From Armani to SHEIN: Italy Scrutinizes Green and Ethical Fashion Claims In July 2024, the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) initiated proceedings and carried out inspections at the premises of Giorgio Armani and Christian Dior for alleged breaches of the Italian Consumer Code in their advertising of clothing and accessories. The Dior probe was closed just last month without finding an infringement after the company gave a set of legally binding commitments designed to address any possible false statements in ethics and social responsibility statements. In September 2024, AGCM also launched an investigation against Infinite Styles for possible generic, vague, confusing, and/or misleading environmental claims made in relation to SHEIN's Italian website. The authority focused on the misleading use of unclear claims such as “'circularity'” and “'green' fibres,” lack of information on additional recyclability of the garment, and contradictions between the company's sustainability reports in previous years and its commitment to decarbonise. The CMA Tightens Scrutiny on Green Cla...","1. Rise in Fashion Industry Enforcement as Green Claims Directive Stalls In recent years, legislative initiatives have increasingly reflected the green agenda and sustainability objectives of the European Commission (the Commission). Authorities have been paying closer attention to unfair commercial practices, including the dissemination of inaccurate corporate responsibility disclosures and false or exaggerated environmental claims. The fashion industry has emerged as a key focus area, with national agencies across Europe intensifying efforts to investigate greenwashing, deceptive labeling, and misleading ethical assertions, especially concerning labour practices. In the past month or so, two pivotal developments unfolded: The first one took place on 25 May 2025, when the Commission formally joined forces with several national competition authorities in urging the online fashion giant SHEIN to comply with EU consumer protection laws. The request followed a coordinated investigation that uncovered suspected fake discounts, manipulation of reviews and ratings, deceptive product labels, and misleading sustainability claims. This joint enforcement action complements a separate, ongoing Commission investigation under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The DSA imposes heightened due diligence obligations aimed at ensuring transparency and consumer trust in digital markets on very large online platforms (VLOPs), and SHEIN was designated a VLOP in April 2024. The second development occurred just last week, when the Commission announced - and later clarified - its intention to withdraw support for the Green Claims Directive (GCD) unless the Council's proposed amendment to include 30 million micro-enterprises within its scope was removed. Micro-enterprises are defined as companies with fewer than 10 employees and less than €2 million in revenue. Originally unveiled in March 2023, the GCD aimed to protect consumers from misleading environmental marketing by requiring companies to have their green claims independently verified. The final text of the Directive had been expected imminently. The Commission's reversal is formally grounded in concerns that the Directive, as amended, would impose a disproportionate administrative burden on small businesses.

Once again, at this year's Wimbledon tournament, the only thing distracting from the tennis is the court-side style. “Wimbledon has turned the stands into a catwalk, and I am here for it,” says model and presenter Leomie Anderson, who is covering Wimbledon as Clearpay's fashion expert this season. If recent years saw guests erring on the side of safe – quiet luxury defined by demure dresses, boxy blazers and the occasional fascinator – 2025 has shifted gear. “There's a real shift happening,” Anderson explains, “people used to play it safe with blazers, midi dresses, the usual suspects. But this year, the crowd is serving. It's like everyone got the memo that Wimbledon is just as much a style moment as it is a sport.” And the stats back her up. Broderie anglaise is booming – with maxi dresses up 147%, skirts up 33% – hats are having a high-fashion renaissance with floppy styles up 99%, and butter-yellow is surging according to Clearpay. The best celebrity looks managed to balance their personality with a playful nod to the tournament's stereotypes – from Wimbledon whites to strawberries and cream. “There's something powerful about its simplicity, the traditions – the setting, the subtlety,” says Anderson. “People know they have to bring their A-game.” Here are some of the best-dressed celebrities at the tournament so far and how they aced Wimbledon style. Olivia Rodrigo A masterstroke in edging up tradition, singer Olivia Rodrigo, 22, wore a red gingham shirt dress by Ralph Lauren from the spring/summer 2000 archive – a playful nod to Wimbledon's iconic strawberries and cream. Her boyfriend, Louis Partridge, 22, coordinated in a red striped tie and navy blazer. Following her headlining performance at Glastonbury Festival on Sunday, Rodrigo managed to nail the elusive balance of British heritage and Gen Z irreverence. Anna and Michael Murray Also sticking to Wimble classics was retail tycoon and CEO of Frasers Group, Michael Murray, who went traditional in a linen white suit, a cream Panama and brown suede loafers. His wife Anna wore the print of the season in a tulle black and white polka dot midi dress, with black suede pumps and black leather Birkin. Cate Blanchett Actress Cate Blanchett, 56, stood out on Centre Court in a pearlescent Prince of Wales check suit by Giorgio Armani. Sharply tailored but soft in palette, it was a classic Blanchett power move, turning heads without the noise. “Cate's baby blue tartan suit was effortless and elegant,” Anderson puts it, “that classic tailoring is signature Cate cool.” Leslie Mann Wimbledon whites are a fail-safe style to sport year after year. While they run the risk of becoming repetitive and – dare I say – boring; when styled right with interesting cuts, whites can be as elegant as ever. Actress Leslie Mann, 53, appeared on day three in an ivory Dior bar jacket and delicate lace skirt. The look was reminiscent of the Princess of Wales recent Self Portrait ensemble at the Order of the Garter in June. David Beckham One thing more certain than spotting a cream Panama hat in the Wimbledon stands is spotting David Beckham. The 50-year-old former footballer once again brought off-court elegance in a cream silk-linen suit from his own Boss collaboration, finished with a chocolate brown tie. The only fashion blunder was plaster cast on his right arm – though even that couldn't detract from his summer suiting credentials. Dominic Cooper Unlike Beckham, 47 year-old actor Dominic Cooper opted out of the classic Wimbledon look and sported a bright powder blue suit with matching trainers. “I'm seeing bold colour choices […] and people leaning into what makes their style unique,” says Anderson of the look. Cooper reminded us that co-ordination doesn't have to mean stiff – and tonal can be a statement when done right. Tom Daley Dusky teal was Olympic diver Tom Daley's shade of choice – cool and contemporary and a refreshing break from Wimbledon white. Daley, 31, paired the Paul Smith suit with a Christian Louboutin clutch and a Chopard watch. Judy Murray Mother to former Wimbledon champion Sir Andy Murray, Judy Murray chose a sunshine-yellow Me+Em dress with white platform trainers.

The best celebrity looks managed to balance the wearer's personality with a playful nod to the tournament's stereotypes – from Wimbledon whites to strawberries and cream. “There's something powerful about its simplicity, the traditions – the setting, the subtlety,” says Anderson. “People know they have to bring their A-game.” Here are some of the best-dressed celebrities at the tournament so far and how they aced Wimbledon style. Olivia Rodrigo A masterstroke in edging up tradition, singer Olivia Rodrigo, 22, wore a red gingham shirt dress by Ralph Lauren from the spring/summer 2000 archive – a playful nod to Wimbledon's iconic strawberries and cream. Her boyfriend, Louis Partridge, 22, coordinated in a red striped tie and navy blazer. Following her headlining performance at Glastonbury Festival on Sunday, Rodrigo managed to nail the elusive balance of British heritage and Gen Z irreverence. Anna and Michael Murray Also sticking to Wimble classics was the retail tycoon and CEO of Frasers Group, Michael Murray, who went traditional in a linen white suit, a cream Panama and brown suede loafers. His wife Anna wore the print of the season in a tulle black and white polka dot midi dress, with black suede pumps and black leather Birkin. Cate Blanchett Actress Cate Blanchett, 56, stood out on Centre Court in a pearlescent Prince of Wales check suit by Giorgio Armani. Sharply tailored but soft in palette, it was a classic Blanchett power move, turning heads without the noise. “Cate's baby blue tartan suit was effortless and elegant,” Anderson puts it, “that classic tailoring is signature Cate cool.” Leslie Mann Wimbledon whites are a fail-safe style to sport year after year. While they run the risk of becoming repetitive and – dare I say – boring; when styled right with interesting cuts, whites can be as elegant as ever. Actor Leslie Mann, 53, appeared on day three in an ivory Dior bar jacket and delicate lace skirt. The look was reminiscent of the Princess of Wales' recent Self Portrait ensemble at the Order of the Garter in June. David Beckham One thing more certain than spotting a cream Panama hat in the Wimbledon stands is spotting David Beckham. The 50-year-old former footballer once again brought off-court elegance in a cream silk-linen suit from his own Boss collaboration, finished with a chocolate brown tie. The only fashion blunder was a plaster cast on his right arm – though even that couldn't detract from his summer suiting credentials. Dominic Cooper Unlike Beckham, 47 year-old actor Dominic Cooper opted out of the classic Wimbledon look and sported a bright powder blue suit with matching trainers. “I'm seeing bold colour choices […] and people leaning into what makes their style unique,” says Anderson of the look. Cooper reminded us that co-ordination doesn't have to mean stiff – and tonal can be a statement when done right. Tom Daley Dusky teal was Olympic diver Tom Daley's shade of choice – cool and contemporary and a refreshing break from Wimbledon white. Daley, 31, paired the Paul Smith suit with a Christian Louboutin clutch and a Chopard watch. Judy Murray Judy Murray, the mother former Wimbledon champion Sir Andy Murray, chose a sunshine-yellow Me+Em dress with white platform trainers. The cheerful dress was bang on trend, with butter yellow emerging as the summer's sleeper hit. Murray, 65, wasn't the only celebrity to sport the shade. “[Actor] Omari Douglas's all-yellow outfit too … is exactly the kind of energy the tournament needs,” says Anderson.

2026 春夏系列中，整體輪廓保持一貫的鬆弛感，卻處處可見Armani先生精雕細琢的立體邏輯。 雙排扣青果領西裝選用低開襟設計，線條自然展開，內斂卻帶有男性自信。 褶襇闊長褲或自然垂墜、或束於踝間，搭配麂皮便鞋、編織涼鞋或粉彩查卡靴，這是 Giorgio Armani 式的放鬆輪廓：每一寸布料都有其流動節奏，每一道剪裁都緊扣內斂優雅。 3. 材質層次

VOGUE verrät, wie sie jetzt kombiniert werden. Diese 5 Schuhe aus den 80ern liegen jetzt wieder im Trend! Die Mode der 80er-Jahre ist schwer zu vergessen – die Schulterpolster zum Beispiel oder die knalligen Farben.

VOGUE verrät, welche Modelle zurück auf dem Laufsteg – und der Straße – sind und wie sie heute kombiniert werden. 5 Modelle aus den 80ern, die im Sommer 2025 wieder angesagt sind #1 Ballerinas In den 30er-Jahren lancierten Designer:innen wie Christian Dior, Elsa Schiaparelli und Yves Saint Laurent die ersten Ballerinas, die nicht nur für ihre Eleganz, sondern auch für ihren Komfort gefeiert wurden. Später dann, in den 80er-Jahren, war auch Prinzessin Diana ein großer Fan der Silhouette; während Kate Moss und Alexa Chung in den späten 2000er- und frühen 2010er-Jahren zu den Anhängerinnen gehörten. Perry Ellis stellte 1987 ein schlichtes weißes Modell vor, das sie gepaart mit einem weißen, geradlinigen Look über den Laufsteg schickte. Nachdem die Modelle dann einige Jahre von der Bildfläche verschwunden waren, bahnten sie sich in den letzten Saisons ihren Weg zurück an die Spitze. Während in den 80er-Jahren aber vorrangig klassische Designs im Vordergrund standen, zeigen sich die Ballerinas heute verspielter – zum Beispiel aus Mesh oder PVC, mit Leoparden- oder Reptilmuster. Bei Chloé präsentierte Chemena Kamali beispielsweise eine geschnürte Boho-Version der Schuhe, die sie zu einem fließenden roséfarbenen Set kombinierte. #2 Slingbacks Apropos elegante Schuhe: Slingback-Modelle, also jene mit Riemchen um die Ferse, gehörten in den 80er-Jahren zur Arbeitsuniform der Frauen. 1987, als das sogenannte Power-Dressing in vollem Gange war, brauchte man ein Design, das bequem, aber dennoch formell war. So wählte Giorgio Armani für seine Kollektion im besagten Jahr Slingbacks, die er zu einer Bundfaltenhose, einer Bluse und einem Blazer mit breiten Schulterpolstern kombinierte. In 2025 kommen Slingbacks besonders gerne mit Kitten Heels daher – wie Marken wie Jacquemus, Contessa Mills und Tamara Ralph bestätigen. Letztere setzte auf eine schwarze Variante der Slingbacks und kombinierte sie mit einer samtigen Off-Shoulder-Bluse und einem Midirock mit Perlenverzierung. #3 T-Steg-Sandalen Sich von vergangenen Jahrzehnten inspirieren zu lassen, ist kein neues Konzept. Und während die Mode der 80er-Jahre der Welt eine Mischung aus Opulenz, Sinnlichkeit und Dramatik bescherte, brachte sie auch viele Elemente der 20er-Jahre zurück – wie lange Halsketten und T-Steg-Sandalen. Givenchy stellte in 1988 beispielsweise ein mit Polka Dots verziertes Modell vor – in Kombination mit einem trägerlosen Kleid im gleichen Muster. Es gab eine Zeit, in der Schuhe mit T-Steg als altmodisch galten. Jetzt, im Sommer 2025, finden die geschichtsträchtigen und mühelos eleganten Schuhe wieder Anklang. Christopher Esber, eine Marke mit australischen Wurzeln, verlieh ihnen mit einer Mesh-Variante und gestylt zum minimalistischen Ensemble aus einem weißen Neckholdertop und einer schwarzen Stoffhose einen modernen Dreh. #4 Oxford-Schuhe In den späten 80er-Jahren begann sich langsam der Minimalismus, der die nächsten Jahre prägen sollte, zu etablieren. Ein Stil, der sich durch androgyne Accessoires – wie zum Beispiel die Oxford-Schuhe – bemerkbar machte. Ralph Lauren hatte sie 1985 bereits mit Absatz vorgestellt; Helmut Lang und Yohji Yamamoto verwischten die Geschlechtergrenzen dann mit Versionen, die fast identisch zu den Herrenschuhen waren. Lang kombinierte sie mit einem langärmeligen Rollkragenkleid, Yamamoto mit einer weißen Oversize-Weste und einem blauen Satinrock. Oxford-Schuhe zogen sich wie ein roter Faden durch die Frühjahr/Sommer-Kollektion 2025 von Loewe. Anstatt sie wie damals zu ebenso androgynen Looks zu stylen, sorgte Jonathan Anderson für einen Stilbruch und kombinierte sie zu romantisch-verspielten Blumen- und Babydoll-Kleidern. #5 Zweifarbige Pumps Das Chanel der 80er-Jahre verkörperte einen Luxus, der sich durch Tweed-Sets, Perlenschmuck – und zweifarbige Pumps auszeichnete. Gründerin Coco Chanel trug oft selbst ein Paar mit niedrigem Absatz. 1982 (ein Jahr bevor Karl Lagerfeld zum französischen Modehaus stieß) sah man zweifarbige Pumps in Kombination mit einem weißen Kleid, einem schwarzen Blazer, Handschuhen, Gürteln und langen Perlenketten auf dem Laufsteg. Während diese klassischen schwarz-cremefarbenen Pumps weiterhin bei Chanel zu sehen sind, gibt es Häuser wie Nina Ricci oder Balmain, die die zweifarbigen Modelle ausgefallener – aber immer noch im gleichen Stil – interpretieren. Balmain setzte für den Sommer 2025 beispielsweise auf eine rot-goldene Version, gepaart mit einem Tweed-Minirock und einer passenden Jacke.","SPR_COMBO[de]Ob zweifarbige Pumps oder T-Steg-Sandalen: Einige Schuhe aus den 80er-Jahren erleben in 2025 ein Comeback.

mov_5A4377AC7C70490E03D8426DECF164D7,"  According to : “Never before have two global icons of Italian , style, skill, ingenuity and success come together to create an 'instant classic'.” Impressive as this latest, of many, variations on the successful Fiat 500 theme is with the 500e Collector's Edition, I can't believe that the little car exceeds, say, Sophia Loren modelling one of 's sensational outfits. Indeed, Fiat has previously collaborated with two other “icons” to knock out a 500 special – the Fiat 500 by Gucci Edition (2011) and the Fiat 500 Riva (2016). There was also a pretty funky Fiat Panda Alessi (2006). There may be other examples. So maybe not “never before”, and “never better” would just be rude. Almost routine, you might add. Maybe one day they'll produce the Fiat 600e . I'll leave it at that. Another reason for researching these past special editions is to assess their investment potential. I regret to say that, thus far, they don't seem to go for much more than their unspecial peers, with the partial exception of the Panda Alessi. Unlike the Mini Inspired by Goodwood or the Aston Martin Cygnet, two more or less handcrafted versions of popular small cars, which have held their value very well, the 500 specials don't really justify the premium, leastways in economic terms. My test car, at £34,035 (nearer to £30,000 if you shop around), is quite the fashion premium, and only really makes sense on aesthetic grounds. The Spec Fiat 500e Giorgio Armani Price: £34,035 Propulsion: Single electric motor, powered by 42kWh battery, FWD Power (hp): 118 Top speed (mph): 93 0-60 (seconds): 9 Economy (mile/kWh): 4.3 Range (miles): circa 160 CO2 emissions: 0 On that challenge, the old boy has done a good job. At 91 this month (Buon compleanno!) , I'm not sure exactly how hands-on he's been, but the car literally bears his signature (on the touchscreen and discrete balding on its flanks), and the “GA” logo adorns the light grey artificial leather seats and the smart 17-inch alloy wheels, which catch the eye. The paint job works surprisingly well. It has a silky, mild sort of gloss to it, ceramic-style. The shade is “greige”, midway between grey and beige, and a lot nicer than that sounds (there's also a teal blue alternative). On a long (140-mile) drive to the excellent Heveningham Concours in Suffolk, where the Armani edition fits in effortlessly, I found the level of all-round comfort perfectly acceptable, and being electric only, it's fairly refined, plus the boot is big enough for an overnight bag. As a town car, it can cope with the occasional adventure. Fiat claims a range of 192 miles on a single charge but, in my experience, this is over-optimistic. Using “Sherpa” mode a lot to save energy, meaning poor acceleration and top speed of 49mph for much of the drive I squeezed about 140 miles out of it, plus 50 miles spare, and that was also on a hot day. In winter, on the motorway… much less. Petrol or hybrid 500s are no longer available, by the way. In fairness, I should add that the 500e is actually made in Italy, rather than Poland as its immediate predecessor was, and is the first between four (loosely speaking) Italian “icons” – Fiat, Armani and, albeit posthumously, Federico Fellini and Nino Rota. Rather than using a conventional electric whining sound for the legally-mandated pedestrian warning, Fiat took the opportunity to make a sonic brand. It's a melodic sample from Fellini's 1971 comedy-drama Amacord – which translates as “fond memory” – composed by Rota. It is broadcast through the front spoiler when you hit 12mph, but if you have the windows down you can hear it. It is delightful and unique. Chimes apart, the reason why the 500 is so popular has a lot to do with its looks, and here they are gently enhanced by the Fiat and Armani designers. In fact, I found it all a bit too subtle: the Armani signature below the rear side window being almost invisible, and no Armani badging on the boot at all. I mean, I'd be spending £30,000 and I'd at least want the world to know all about that. It also has some formidable competition with the arrivals of the new Renault 5 E-Tech, while the BYD Dolphin Surf is just a better product, looks aside. I'll wait for the second-hand ones, and then pounce, like finding an Armani tie in a charity shop.","According to : “Never before have two global icons of Italian , style, skill, ingenuity and success come together to create an 'instant classic'.” Impressive as this latest, of many, variations on the successful Fiat 500 theme is with the 500e Collector's Edition, I can't believe that the little car exceeds, say, Sophia Loren modelling one of 's sensational outfits. Indeed, Fiat has previously collaborated with two other “icons” to knock out a 500 special – the Fiat 500 by Gucci Edition (2011) and the Fiat 500 Riva (2016). There was also a pretty funky Fiat Panda Alessi (2006). There may be other examples. So maybe not “never before”, and “never better” would just be rude. Almost routine, you might add. Maybe one day they'll produce the Fiat 600e . I'll leave it at that. Another reason for researching these past special editions is to assess their investment potential. I regret to say that, thus far, they don't seem to go for much more than their unspecial peers, with the partial exception of the Panda Alessi. Unlike the Mini Inspired by Goodwood or the Aston Martin Cygnet, two more or less handcrafted versions of popular small cars, which have held their value very well, the 500 specials don't really justify the premium, leastways in economic terms. My test car, at £34,035 (nearer to £30,000 if you shop around), is quite the fashion premium, and only really makes sense on aesthetic grounds. The Spec Fiat 500e Giorgio Armani Price: £34,035 Propulsion: Single electric motor, powered by 42kWh battery, FWD Power (hp): 118 Top speed (mph): 93 0-60 (seconds): 9 Economy (mile/kWh): 4.3 Range (miles): circa 160 CO2 emissions: 0 On that challenge, the old boy has done a good job. At 91 this month (Buon compleanno!) , I'm not sure exactly how hands-on he's been, but the car literally bears his signature (on the touchscreen and discrete balding on its flanks), and the “GA” logo adorns the light grey artificial leather seats and the smart 17-inch alloy wheels, which catch the eye. The paint job works surprisingly well. It has a silky, mild sort of gloss to it, ceramic-style. The shade is “greige”, midway between grey and beige, and a lot nicer than that sounds (there's also a teal blue alternative). On a long (140-mile) drive to the excellent Heveningham Concours in Suffolk, where the Armani edition fits in effortlessly, I found the level of all-round comfort perfectly acceptable, and being electric only, it's fairly refined, plus the boot is big enough for an overnight bag. As a town car, it can cope with the occasional adventure. Fiat claims a range of 192 miles on a single charge but, in my experience, this is over-optimistic. Using “Sherpa” mode a lot to save energy, meaning poor acceleration and top speed of 49mph for much of the drive I squeezed about 140 miles out of it, plus 50 miles spare, and that was also on a hot day. In winter, on the motorway… much less. Petrol or hybrid 500s are no longer available, by the way. In fairness, I should add that the 500e is actually made in Italy, rather than Poland as its immediate predecessor was, and is the first between four (loosely speaking) Italian “icons” – Fiat, Armani and, albeit posthumously, Federico Fellini and Nino Rota. Rather than using a conventional electric whining sound for the legally-mandated pedestrian warning, Fiat took the opportunity to make a sonic brand. It's a melodic sample from Fellini's 1971 comedy-drama Amacord – which translates as “fond memory” – composed by Rota. It is broadcast through the front spoiler when you hit 12mph, but if you have the windows down you can hear it. It is delightful and unique. Chimes apart, the reason why the 500 is so popular has a lot to do with its looks, and here they are gently enhanced by the Fiat and Armani designers. In fact, I found it all a bit too subtle: the Armani signature below the rear side window being almost invisible, and no Armani badging on the boot at all.

In the US, the brand has become more of a punchline than a presence. Sales are sluggish, showroom traffic is a memory, and aside from the quirky charm of the 500e, the brand's lineup has shriveled into near irrelevance. Even in Europe, its historical foothold, Fiat has struggled to maintain momentum in the face of fierce competition and unpredictability of electrification. Fiat's parent company, Stellantis, has seen the Italian marque underperform compared to its French and American siblings. The Mirafiori plant in Turin, once the pride of Italian industry, has been underutilized thanks in part to the modest demand for the all-electric 500e. Enter the new Fiat 500 Hybrid, serving as a lifeline for the embattled automaker. Positioned between Fiat's full-electrification push and its internal-combustion past, the 500 Hybrid wants to win over those who want affordability, character, and efficiency without going fully electric. What the Fiat 500 Hybrid Brings to the Table At a glance, the new 500 Hybrid looks just like the 500e – stylish, compact, and unmistakably Italian – but underneath, it's a different animal. It's powered by Fiat's 1.0-liter FireFly three-cylinder mild-hybrid engine, expected to produce 69 horsepower and 68 lb-ft of torque. Paired with a six-speed manual transmission, it brings back an analog joy that's increasingly rare, especially in the world of electrified cars. The car will be available in three body styles: a traditional Hatchback, the quirky 3+1 with a rear-hinged third door, and a Cabrio, making the 500 still the only convertible in its class. The interior is equipped with modern features, such as a 10.25-inch touchscreen running Uconnect 5, wireless Apple CarPlay and Android Auto, and a suite of ADAS features like lane keeping and emergency braking. Production kicks off this November at Mirafiori, with 5,000 units planned by year's end and a ramp-up to 100,000 units annually. A ""500 Torino"" special edition will be launched to mark the occasion. Pricing and Availability In Europe, the Fiat 500 Hybrid will start at just €17,000, making it nearly €2,000 cheaper than the 500e. In the US, the fully electric 2025 500e is solely available at $35,500 for the Giorgio Armani Collector's Edition. If the 500 Hybrid makes it to American shores, it could undercut that by several thousand dollars, hopefully sliding in under $30,000, bringing some much-needed affordability to Fiat's US offerings. But that's still a big ""if."" Stellantis has not confirmed any plans to bring the 500 Hybrid to America... yet.

Paris Haute Couture Week is back with a bang, kicking off July's Fall 2025 couture shows with Schiaparelli's star-studded runway. Daniel Roseberry's “Back to the Future” collection explored Elsa Schiaparelli's signature designs from the 1930's with added glamour and futuristic flair, from metallic biker shoulders to a bejeweled anatomical heart, gleaming eye embroidery, and an array of flooring sheer-paneled silk gowns. Naturally, the occasion was witnessed by a chic crowd including Dua Lipa, Cardi B, Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, Karol G, and Hunter Schafer. But that's just the tip of the haute couture iceberg! As the shows continue from July 7 to 10, keep an eye out for new collections from Chanel, Giorgio Armani Privé, Giambattista Valli, Robert Wun, Maison Margiela, Georges Hobeika, and Germanier—plus Demna's final collection for Balenciaga! Daniel Roseberry (Courtesy) All images: Courtesy of Schiaparelli Anne Hathaway Blossoms In Sarah Burton's Givenchy For Vogue's August Issue Anne Hathaway is in full bloom for her latest Vogue cover! The actress fronts the magazine's August 2025 issue in a new editorial exclusively styled by Tabitha Simmons, wearing nine looks from Sarah Burton's debut Givenchy Fall 2025 collection. For her shoot by Annie Leibovitz, Hathaway takes Burton's celebrated creations on a journey through New York City, including Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. While speaking with Maya Singer for her feature interview, Hathaway also chats about her new film Mother Mary, feeling like a “beginner” in her role as its titular pop star in crisis, and her new chapter of wide-ranging projects in the 2020's (which will also include new Princess Diaries and Devil Wears Prada sequels!) . “What struck me right away, reading the script, is that you can't 'perform' Mother Mary,” said Hathaway. “If I got the part, I would have to become material David could craft with. I had to submit to being a beginner. The humility of that—showing up every day knowing you're going to suck. And it has to be okay. You're not 'bad.' You're just a beginner. Getting to that mindset—I had to shed some things that were hard to shed. It was welcome. But it was hard, the way transformational experiences can be hard.” All images: Annie Leibovitz JW Anderson Steps Back From Runways—And Steps Into Home Design Jonathan Anderson's namesake JW Anderson brand is taking a break from the runway, According to Dazed, the beloved designer's eclectic label is stopping its seasonal runway shows and largely stepping back from releasing large fashion collections. Instead, the brand will focusing on creating accessories, staple fashion pieces, and luxury home goods—as well as expanding its retail footprint with new stores in New York, Paris, Belgravia, and Pimlico. Anderson's new Resort 2026 collection is the first to introduce the concept, featuring a thinner J.W. Anderson logo across the designer's signature whimsical knits and denim. His ready-to-wear pieces are paired with a range of his favorite curated objects, including re-editions of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's oak lamps and stools, curated books, vintage gardening tools, Lucie Rie mugs, Murano glassware, Jason Mosseri's Hope Spring chairs, Akiko Hirai's ceramics, Welsh blankets, hand-forged nails, Houghton Hall Estate honey, and Postcard Teas' coffee-flavored tea. For a personal touch, all are shown in the brand's new lookbook, featuring a cast of JWA collaborators and friends like Joe Alwyn, Bella Freud, Ben Whishaw, Luca Guadagnino, and more.

mov_4F6C592BFF74DF8E1465287FFC8DB698,"  India, July 8 -- The runways at the Milan and Paris Fashion Weeks made one thing very clear: fashion's gaze is turned to India. Even as questions around appropriation arose, India was threaded firmly into the core of the season, from textiles and textures, right down to the models and set design. Fashion has always turned to India for ideas. It is a long history dressed up as inspiration. For instance, Jean Paul Gaultier showed turbans, bindis, and sherwani jackets in his 2007 couture line. John Galliano pulled heavily from Mughal silhouettes during his Dior years. Karl Lagerfeld sent Chanel's Metiers d'Art to Mumbai back in 2012. The staging was theatrical. The embroidery was Indian. The credits were barely there. Dries Van Noten once said India was his textile dreamland. He was not alone. Fast fashion jumped in too. High street brands have churned out block prints, mirror work, paisley shawls, and even yoga pants with temple motifs. Little to no credit was given. Dior served up Paris Fashion Week's most talked-about pieces: a shimmering, mukaish-embroidered long coat. This art form dates back to third-century Lucknow and involves flattened metal wires stitched into fabric. Once worn by royalty, the Dior version (valued at close to 1.72 lakh) took twelve artisans and over thirty days to finish. However, the brand did not credit the technique or the artisans involved in its show notes, drawing flak from Indian designers and craft activists. Prada's menswear show in Milan SS26 made waves for all the wrong reasons. Among the slick tailoring and rich fabrics was a humble-looking sandal. Open-toe, flat sole, a leather toe-loop. Yes, we are talking about Kolhapuris. These are not just any shoes. They are traditional hand-made sandals crafted in Maharashtra for generations. They have been granted geographical indication status, which means their design is protected, legally linked to their region and community. Prada described them as ""leather flat sandals."" That was it. No reference to Kolhapur. No mention of India. Nothing. The backlash was swift. The Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce raised formal concerns. Indian designers called it out. Eventually, Prada issued a letter acknowledging the sandals were inspired by India and said they were open to future dialogue with Indian artisans. While global brands were fumbling with credits, Kartik Research arrived in Paris and flipped the script. The Delhi-based label presented a travelogue-like collection, accompanied by a visual essay titled, How to Make It in India. The brand also finally forayed into womenswear amid serious buzz. From textiles to silhouettes, each piece told a story of Indian craftsmanship, ranging from handlooms to hand-weaving and dyeing. Surfaces also told a story of heritage, with Jaipur rugs covering every inch of the set. Pharrell Williams's second menswear show for Louis Vuitton was another moment where Indian craft played a leading role. The runway was staged on Paris's oldest bridge, which was transformed into a snakes and ladders board. The set was designed by Indian architect Bijoy Jain and built using Indian marble, stone, and wood. The soundtrack was created in collaboration with A R Rahman. Palm trees, crystal-studded trunks, elephant motifs, and even a miniature autorickshaw bag nodded to Indian and South Asian culture. This was not an abstract reference. Louis Vuitton clearly credited the designers, artists, and inspiration behind the show. India's fashion week footprint did not end at fabric or set designs - models from India took centre stage at some of the biggest showcases. Walking for Hermes was Nakul Bhardwaj, who made headlines last year as the first Indian on the Versace runway. Meanwhile, Jainil Mehta made waves at Louis Vuitton, Saurang Sharma (pictured left) brought his quiet power to Issey Miyake and Shubham Vaidkar appeared in Giorgio Armani's presentation....","India, July 8 -- The runways at the Milan and Paris Fashion Weeks made one thing very clear: fashion's gaze is turned to India.

That was it. No reference to Kolhapur. No mention of India. Nothing. The backlash was swift. The Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce raised formal concerns. Indian designers called it out. Eventually, Prada issued a letter acknowledging the sandals were inspired by India and said they were open to future dialogue with Indian artisans. While global brands were fumbling with credits, Kartik Research arrived in Paris and flipped the script. The Delhi-based label presented a travelogue-like collection, accompanied by a visual essay titled, How to Make It in India. The brand also finally forayed into womenswear amid serious buzz. From textiles to silhouettes, each piece told a story of Indian craftsmanship, ranging from handlooms to hand-weaving and dyeing. Surfaces also told a story of heritage, with Jaipur rugs covering every inch of the set. Pharrell Williams's second menswear show for Louis Vuitton was another moment where Indian craft played a leading role. The runway was staged on Paris's oldest bridge, which was transformed into a snakes and ladders board. The set was designed by Indian architect Bijoy Jain and built using Indian marble, stone, and wood. The soundtrack was created in collaboration with A R Rahman. Palm trees, crystal-studded trunks, elephant motifs, and even a miniature autorickshaw bag nodded to Indian and South Asian culture. This was not an abstract reference. Louis Vuitton clearly credited the designers, artists, and inspiration behind the show. India's fashion week footprint did not end at fabric or set designs - models from India took centre stage at some of the biggest showcases. Walking for Hermes was Nakul Bhardwaj, who made headlines last year as the first Indian on the Versace runway. Meanwhile, Jainil Mehta made waves at Louis Vuitton, Saurang Sharma (pictured left) brought his quiet power to Issey Miyake and Shubham Vaidkar appeared in Giorgio Armani's presentation....",2025-07-08 07:08:17,en,WEB,,,,,False,1,False,False,,,The comment is a detailed article about fashion trends and Indian influences in global fashion weeks.

Models emerged from an ornate entrance, parading long- skirted dresses in soft toned tweeds, with touches of sparkles and tufts of feathers. They wore tight buns and tall boots, which left u-shaped heel indentations in the plush carpet. Colors were muted, mostly ivory, beige and brown, but one silky dress came in a pale silvery blue, worn under a short, yellow-toned bomber jacket with a prominent, feathery collar. The show was held in the Salon d'Honneur, a smaller space of the freshly-restored Grand Palais, marking a contrast with the soaring, central exhibition hall usually favored by the label. Facing a prolonged slump, many labels in the high end fashion industry are renewing their design approach, with Kering-owned Gucci and Balenciaga, and LVMH's Dior among labels that have recently named new designers.

mov_75A0B96C670D8789063101DC493AF407,"  PARIS (AP) — Armani Privé opened Tuesday under an unmistakable shadow. For the first time in the 20-year history of his couture house, Giorgio Armani was not present in Paris to take his bow. Days from his 91st birthday and following doctors' advice after a recent hospital stay, Armani reportedly oversaw the Paris couture week show remotely from home, a moment of absence that lands heavily for a designer who has shaped every one of his brand's collections since its founding. The show's theme, “Seductive Black,” played out with literal and symbolic force on the runway: black in myriad forms, from liquid velvet and lacquered silk to pavé crystals and flashes of gold. Even the models' makeup followed suit, rendered in shades of gray. For some in the front row, the relentless palette felt pointed. Guests quietly wondered if the choice of black was a coded message from the maestro himself. Armani missed Milan, too This is not the first major show Armani has missed this season. Just weeks ago, he was forced to sit out Milan Fashion Week for the first time in the label's history, following a brief hospitalization. According to the brand, the absence was a precaution to save energy for his Paris couture appearance. For decades, Armani — often referred to as “Re Giorgio,” or King George, in Italy — has been both the creative and business force behind one of fashion's last great independent empires. The Tuesday collection balanced tension and control. After an uncertain start, including velvet jodhpurs and stark crystalline seams, Armani's familiar codes quickly emerged: tuxedo jackets transformed into evening gowns with plunging lapels and floating bow ties, tailored blazers worn on bare skin and military-inspired equestrian jackets paired with slim velvet pants. Bursts of embroidery and colored feathers provided a balance from the monochrome. More in Style A living fashion ma estro Armani's recent absences have sent ripples through the industry. In a landscape dominated by conglomerates like LVMH and Kering, Armani remains the sole shareholder of his company, personally overseeing every collection for nearly 50 years. In 2024, Armani Group reported revenues of $2.5 billion, while Giorgio Armani's personal fortune is estimated at $11–13 billion — even as the global luxury market faces headwinds. Armani is widely credited with redefining men's and women's tailoring, pioneering gender-fluidity in fashion, and inventing celebrity red-carpet dressing, from Julia Roberts to Cate Blanchett. Yet the designer himself has acknowledged that age is now a reality to deal with and that pulling back could be a necessity. Whether the monochrome collection was a deliberate metaphor or simply a showcase of discipline, “Seductive Black” felt personal — both a mood and a message, perhaps an understated nod to a master whose presence, even in absence, remains absolute. As the show closed, the final bow belonged to the models alone.

tw_sl_5ded616b1ed41785ba0a8212d218358f,"  Team GB's golden girl Keely Hodgkinson showed off her toned physique in an ice bath as she cooled off in the scorching heat. Hodgkinson, 23, might have been thinking more about recovery after she had been gunning for the world indoor 800m record at the inaugural Keely Klassic on February 15. However, she was left ""absolutely gutted"" after she was forced to withdraw from the event after feeling some soreness in her hamstring. Hodgkinson looks to be in the shape of her life as she dunked herself into an ice bath in a recent Instagram upload. The gold medalist wore a black bikini, as she clutched onto either side of the bath, and kept her long blonde hair out of her eyes with a blue headband. ""You're so cool,"" one friend joked as a second replied: ""Balance never looked so good!"" ""That water is going to boil with you in it! You smoking hot,"" a third responded. And another added: ""Ice bath sounds like heaven in this heat!"" While she's quick on the track, Hodgkinson is hot on her fashion - and the Olympian admitted her craziest post-Paris moment was meeting fashion guru Giorgio Armani.

""You're so cool,"" one friend joked as a second replied: ""Balance never looked so good!"" ""That water is going to boil with you in it! You smoking hot,"" a third responded. And another added: ""Ice bath sounds like heaven in this heat!"" While she's quick on the track, Hodgkinson is hot on her fashion - and the Olympian admitted her craziest post-Paris moment was meeting fashion guru Giorgio Armani.

""It was just quite funny because he's this powerful, small man… he's a lot older now… but he looks great. “He's still heavily involved in his work, and I think that was a really cool moment.

mov_122E6FE7AC2F0976B5601CF900BF5B47,"  Get classics from Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani for up to 30% off. Buying fragrances online is already a gamble. If you're pushing the boat out on a new oud or something summery, you want to smell it in person, especially since fragrances returns can be a pain in the ass. But the way Amazon and its Prime Day sale are set up is an even bigger pain in the ass. The section is growing, but right now only some brands and some fragrances are sold by Amazon directly and come with the reassurance that you're buying the real deal. But a lot of bottles are sold by third-party sellers, where discounts are big, but there's no way to know what you're getting before it shows up. It's unlikely you'll get scammed, but you have to be vigilant. Don't try to buy the best colognes out now during Prime Day. Stick to reputable names with a dedicated storefront, and accept that you'll have to buy Terre d'Hermès for retail price. Right now, the best Amazon deals on colognes come from two legends of the game that paved the way for mass-market domination: Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani. Both houses have dedicated Amazon storefronts selling their classic colognes for around 30 percent off. Neither Polo Original or Acqua di Giò are going to win fragrance awards, sure, but they're still wonderful daily drivers and make great gifts. Beyond the variations of those two, you can get Calvin Klein's CK One and selects from David Beckham's line of fragrances for up to 40 percent off. Again, I'd skip the designer stuff, just because Amazon isn't an authorized seller in that world, so it's a bit like the Wild West. Stick to these mass-market hits, so you can save up for a freaky fragrance purchase later in the year. Giorgio Armani Acqua di Giò – Eau de Parfum I usually prefer to get an eau de parfum, just for the sake of sillage and longevity. But in this case, I really do prefer the eau de parfum to the eau de toillette. The muskiness gets cut down for something that feels really fresh and sea-inspired. Giorgio Armani Acqua di Giò - Eau de Toilette But the eau de toilette is the classic. It's the perfect seaside citrus and musk. It might remind you of the '90s, but this style of fragrance is as popular as it's ever been. (As seen by releases like Ranger Station's Rich '90s Dad.) Ralph Lauren Polo The perfect first cologne, the perfect everyday cologne—Ralph Lauren Polo is as good as it gets for a lot of guys. It's one that might get overlooked as old fashioned these days, but no one is going to say woodsy tobacco smells bad. Keep this one stocked. Stetson Original Talking about old fashioned, I shouted out the current Stetson Original in our cologne awards, and it's one I'll always stand by. It's a classic musk. Starts herbal, then moves to amber, and dries down with a sweet amber-y musk. This is what my grandpa smelt like going to church, and these days that's one of the coolest things I can think of. Calvin Klein CK One For me, CK One and Acqua di Giò fight for the top spot in that '90s fresh category. I prefer Armani just because it leans more salty and marine. But CK One is a really solid pick if you prefer something greener. Instead of going citrus into sea salt air, CK One is citrusy to start and finishes with a little bit of amber but mostly green leaves. Also, the lack of musk compared to Armani makes this a more unisex option, in my opinion. David Beckham Refined Woods, Eau de Parfum I'm a Beckham lover. I spent untold hours trying to replicate that freekick against Greece when I was a kid. But I rolled my eyes when he came out with his fragrance collection. Jokes on me, because it's really good, one of my favorite value fragrance lines. None of it reinvents the wheel, but I have a real love for Refined Woods. It's simple: decent longevity vetiver and cedar wood with some spices mixed in at the front. (The brand calls out cardamom and clary sage, but I really get anise.) It's simple, straightforward, and affordable. Can't beat it. David Beckham Infinite Aqua, Eau de Parfum...","Get classics from Ralph Lauren and Giorgio Armani for up to 30% off.

mov_B07FA27E4E0BB5E5818C44D587B08C81,"  Giorgio Armani Privé unveiled its Fall/Winter 2025–26 haute couture collection in Paris with a show titled “Noir Séduisant” (Seductive Black). The presentation marked a significant moment for the fashion house: it celebrated 20 years of Privé and came just days before Giorgio Armani's 91st birthday. Though the designer was absent for the first time due to a brief hospital stay, his presence was felt in every detail of the collection, which he directed remotely. A Cinematic Stage for Couture The show unfolded in the opulent setting of the Palazzo Armani, nestled in Paris's prestigious Triangle d'Or. The ambiance was atmospheric and rich in old-school glamour, enhanced by a smoky jazz soundtrack reminiscent of a 1950s film noir. Models glided through the darkened space with an elegance that spoke volumes, setting the tone for what would be a visually striking and thematically cohesive presentation. The Power and Poetry of Black As its name suggests, “Noir Séduisant” was a poetic ode to black. Armani reimagined the color in myriad ways—through shimmering velvets, structured silks, sequined tulles, and glistening metallic threads. Each piece played with texture and sheen to give depth to a limited palette, proving that black, when wielded by a master, is far from basic. Throughout the collection, there was a rich interplay between masculine and feminine energies. Tailored jackets with sharp shoulders met flowing bustiers and sleek column gowns. Velvet wide-legged trousers sat alongside corseted tops, while velvet coats were paired with intricate embellishments and floral appliqués. The craftsmanship was exquisite, with many looks glittering subtly under the runway lights thanks to delicate beading, embroidery, and Swarovski detailing. Highlights of the Runway From the opening look—featuring an asymmetric sapphire-accented bustier with wide velvet pants—to the closing ensemble where an ethereal figure draped in midnight black lounged over a jade piano, every piece told a story of refined drama. One of the most talked-about looks was a shaggy black ensemble punctuated with bursts of magenta, cobalt, and emerald feathers. Other standout moments included crystal-embellished berets, sultry cartwheel hats, and sculpted evening gowns that sparkled with understated glamour. Accessories remained consistent with the mood: bold, artistic, and unapologetically elegant. A Star-Studded Audience The show drew a crowd of international style icons and celebrities. Among those in attendance were Angela Bassett, Marisa Berenson, Christine Chiu, and Iman Perez. Their presence further reinforced the global appeal of the Armani Privé brand, which continues to resonate with powerful women who appreciate timeless sophistication. Remote Mastery Though Giorgio Armani was not physically present at the show for the first time in the house's history, he supervised everything remotely and delivered a message of assurance and gratitude. His dedication to maintaining the integrity of his vision—even from a distance—underscored the precision and passion behind each look. Beauty & Styling The beauty look for the show was luminous and minimalist. Makeup focused on glowing skin and sculpted eyes, while hair was sleek and pulled back, ensuring that the intricate detailing of the garments remained the focus. The makeup complemented the clothing's richness, bringing balance to the overall styling. A Lasting Statement “Noir Séduisant” was not just a collection—it was a statement. In a world flooded with color and excess, Armani turned to black to showcase the emotion, elegance, and quiet power that can be found in simplicity. The show stood as a tribute to his lifelong commitment to timeless beauty and refined artistry. In a season filled with extravagance, Giorgio Armani reminded the fashion world that there is infinite richness in restraint—and that black, in all its depth and drama, remains the ultimate color of couture.","Giorgio Armani Privé unveiled its Fall/Winter 2025–26 haute couture collection in Paris with a show titled “Noir Séduisant” (Seductive Black).

AFP looks back on the key moments of the Autumn-Winter 2025-2026 season: - New eras - Demna bowed out at Balenciaga after a decade in charge with a show on Wednesday that drew the usual smattering of celebrities to the front rows but had some surprise models on the runway. Kim Kardashian channelled Elizabeth Taylor as she walked the room in a sultry slip dress, while veteran French actress Isabelle Huppert appeared in a turtleneck pulled up to her ears. Belgian Glenn Martens debuted at Maison Margiela the same day. Critics praised his bold first steps as a replacement for British design legend John Galliano, who stepped down in January. The New York Times called Martens' ""Artisanal"" collection, which included thrifted clothing, a ""brilliant no-holds-barred debut"" while Women's Wear Daily said it ""tilted the Paris house in a dark, daring and DIY direction"". - Armani's absence - One notably absentee was Giorgio Armani, 91, who had already cancelled his menswear show in Milan due to health reasons. He also missed the Paris Armani Prive show on doctors' orders. ""In 20 years of Armani Prive, it's the first time I'm not in Paris,"" he said in a statement sent to AFP. ""My doctors advised more rest, even though I felt ready."" He added that he had ""followed and overseen every aspect of the show remotely"", stressing: ""I approved and signed off on everything you will see."" - Cardi B's couture - New York rapper Cardi B had a busy week in Paris and seemed intent on out-couturing many of the models. She appeared at the opening show of the week on Monday at Schiaparelli in a traf fic-stopping tasselled neckpiece and posed with a crow perched on her hand outside the Petit Palais exhibition space. The next day, she turned heads at Stephane Rolland, with a sculptural black headpiece that surrounded her like a religious shroud. On Wednesday she was front row at Balenciaga. - The rose trend - Floral patterns were everywhere, with the rose especially dominant. Giambattista Valli adorned airy gowns with oversized fabric roses, Elie Saab featured them on princess-style dresses, while Armani Prive used pearl-embroidered roses. Balenciaga incorporated rose sequin prints into a skirt suit and Robert Wun showcased black-and-white roses on a structured strapless crinoline dress. - Best of the rest - Syrian designer Rami Al Ali made history as the first couturier from his country to take part in the official Paris calendar, choking back tears at the end of his show of exquisitely tailored pieces.

主催するパリ・オートクチュール組合の公式カレンダー上では、今季は昨シーズンの28から1つ減の27ブランドが参加。 「ディオール（DIOR）」や「ヴァレンティノ（VALENTINO）」、ジャン・ポール・ゴルチエのクチュールライン、「ゴルチエ パリ（GAULTIER PARIS）」等がコレクションを発表せず、久々に「アデリーヌ アンドレ（Adeline André）」等が参加するなどの増減が見られた。 その「ゴルチエ パリ」は、毎シーズン、注目度の高いデザイナーを迎えてコレクションを発表していたが、前回のルドヴィック・サン・セルナンによるコレクションをもってゲスト・デザイナー制は終了。 今年4月に、デュラン・ランティックがパーマネントなアーティスティック・ディレクターに就任。 9月のレディースコレクションに向けて始動し、来年の1月にはオートクチュール・コレクションの発表も予定されているという。 今季のトピックは、何よりも「メゾン マルジェラ（Maison Margiela）」と「バレンシアガ（BALENCIAGA）」だった。 ジョン・ガリアーノが去り、クリエイティブ・ディレクターにマルタン・マルジェラと同郷のベルギー人、グレン・マーティンスが着任した「メゾン マルジェラ」。 マーティンスが「Y/プロジェクト（Y/PROJECT）」で見せていたシュールレアリスティックな手法が、「メゾン マルジェラ」でどのような化学反応を引き起こすのか、大いに注目を集めた。 一方の、デムナによる最終コレクションとなった「バレンシアガ」は、オートクチュール会期中に終了したデムナの懐古作品展「Balenciaga by Demna」と共にメモリアルなものとなった。 来季は、ピエールパオロ・ピッチョーリによる「バレンシアガ」、ジョナサン・アンダーソンによる「ディオール」、マチュー・ブラジによる「シャネル（CHANEL）」、サラ・バートンによる　「ジバンシィ（GIVENCHY）」、そしてデュラン・ランティックによる「ゴルチエ パリ」と、全て出揃うかは現時点で不明ではあるものの、期待値の高いシーズンとなりそうである。 シャネル（CHANEL） Courtesy of CHANEL 今季もクリエイション・スタジオによるコレクションを、グラン・パレにて披露した「シャネル」。 ガブリエル・シャネルが度々イメージソースにして来たイギリスの田園風景や、スコットランドの荒野にインスパイアされた。 アイボリーやブラウン、グリーン、ブラックなどナチュラルなカラーパレットで構成。 ガブリエル・シャネルが好み、ファインジュエリーでも度々登場する麦穂のモチーフが随所にあしらわれ、自然の要素を滲ませた。 フランスでは、麦穂は豊穣の象徴としてのラッキーチャーム。 刺繍を施したツイードのドレスでスタートしたが、シンプルでマニッシュな印象。 ガブリエル・シャネルがメンズのスーツからインスパイアされて、「シャネルスーツ」を編み出したことを想起させた。 羽を飾ったケープにもツイードのメンズライクなワンピースを合わせ、ニーハイブーツをコーディネートしてモダンで若々しいスタイリングに。 チェーンを飾った黒のツイードのセットアップは、甲冑のような力強さを見せる。 麦穂のテクスチャーを思わせるツイードのブルゾンには、シルクサテンのドレープスカートを合わせて、スポーティでマスキュリンなアイテムに敢えてフェミニンなアイテムを組み合わせてコントラストを見せる。 フリンジをあしらったセットアップやワンピースも、フォルムはシンプルでマニッシュな印象。 シルクサテンのロングドレスにも、羽を刺繍してファーのように仕立てたメンズコートをコーディネートして、マスキュリン・フェミニンに。 ラグランスリーブのカーディガン風のツイードジャケットには、プリーツシフォンのスカートを合わせ、適度なカジュアルさを演出。 フェミニンなドレス一辺倒にするのではなく、敢えてマスキュリン・スポーティに仕上げて、ウルトラモダンなクチュールの世界観を描いて見せていた。 メゾン マルジェラ（Maison Margiela） Courtesy of Maison Margiela 文化複合施設である104（サン・キャートル）を会場に、オートクチュールと同等に扱われるアーティザナルコレクションのショーを開催した、新任のグレン・マーティンスによる「メゾン マルジェラ」。 104は、2008年9月にマルタン・マルジェラ本人による最終コレクションが発表された場所で、今季は全てのモデルにマスクが合わせられたことからも、オリジナルへのオマージュ・リスペクトを印象付けた。 今季は、フランドル地方の中世建築からインスパイア。 ゴシック建築に見られる彫像や教会に飾られる聖人たちの彫像、北ヨーロッパのルネッサンス期の邸宅のインテリア、16世紀のフランドル地方のエンボスによるレザーの壁紙、象徴主義の画家ギュスターヴ・モローの作品などにイメージを求め、ベルギー出身のデザイナーらしいダークかつ耽美な世界観を披露している。 透明のプラスチックドレスでスタート。 インナーに同素材のコルセットを合わせ、脚元にはアクリルウェッジソールの「タビ」サンダル。 ギュスターヴ・モローの筆致を思わせるハンドペイントを施したストレッチサテンのセットアップにも、プラスチックのプラストロンをコーディネート。 16世紀のフランドル地方のレザー製壁紙のモチーフをプリントした、金属糸を織り込んだファブリックによるドレスは、ハートの形にシェイプされ、ドラマティックな一点となった。 アップサイクルされたバイカージャケットにも、16世紀のフランドル地方のレザー製型紙のパターンをコピーした紙を貼り付け、敢えて朽ち果てて行く様を表現。 17世紀のオランダの静物画に登場する羽のイメージをプリントしたファブリックをカットアップして繋いだスカートや、アップサイクルされたヴィンテージのネックレスを繋いだニットドレス、17世紀のオランダの静物画に描かれた花をプリントして花をカットして縫い付けたプラスチックのコート。 そのどれもがこのブランドらしいシュールレアリスティックな手法に則っている。 アップサイクルされた素材をあしらうというコンセプトを守りつつ、より手の込んだ徹底した作品作りの姿勢を見せていた。 ジョルジオ アルマーニ プリヴェ（GIORGIO ARMANI PRIVÉ） Courtesy of Giorgio Armani／Photo by Marie-Laure Dutel Israël 「ジョルジオ アルマーニ プリヴェ」は、今年に入ってフランソワ1世通りにオープンさせたパラッツォ・アルマーニにてオートクチュール・コレクションを発表。 ブラックを主軸に据えて、黒というベーシックカラーが持つ究極のエレガンスを表現した。 夜をイメージさせるブルーを差し色にしたテイラードでスタート。 ブロケードや膨れ織り、デボレなど、凹凸感ある素材使いがこのブランドらしい。 プリント地に刺繍を施して絵画的に仕上げたジャケットや、花びらを散らしたような総刺繍のジャケット、抽象画のような刺繍のトップスとテクノ素材のスカートのセットアップなど、一つの時代やスタイルにこだわらない、バリエーション豊かな作品が並ぶ。...,SPR_COMBO[ja]写真左から「シャネル」「バレンシアガ」「メゾン マルジェラ」 「ジョルジオ アルマーニ プリヴェ」
