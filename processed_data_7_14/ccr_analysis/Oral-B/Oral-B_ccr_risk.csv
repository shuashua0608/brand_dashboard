1lyjm63,"‚Äâ As most people know, the official Oral B replacement heads are far too overpriced. The problem I have is that every generic branded replacement toothbrush head I've tried were subpar. Their fit is a little off, so there's a lot of rattle, and you can feel the fact that the head isn't vibrating as much/strongly as it does with an official replacement head. Because of this I'm apprehensive on buying generics online from Amazon/Temu/Aliexpress. I would be stuck with a bunch heads at once if they turn out to be bad (in addition to wasting money). The top listings always have a bunch of great reviews, but I can't help but think that many people either don't notice this flaw that I have, or have lower standards. Because there are some reviews that do point out the same issues I have. So does anyone know of a sure-fire way to get good quality generic Oral B toothbrush heads?","As most people know, the official Oral B replacement heads are far too overpriced.
