The duchess launched her 2023 Napa Valley Rosé through a new wine section of her lifestyle brand's website, Wine.AsEver.com.

Lady Elizabeth reportedly told the biographer: ""Meghan wouldn't tell her Queen Elizabeth II about the wedding dress."" The dress, a Givenchy design with a bateau neckline and three-quarter sleeves, was ultimately viewed by the Queen as ""flamboyant"" and, according to the notes, she felt it was ""not fit for a divorcee"". Meghan had previously been married to film producer Trevor Engelson. Lady Elizabeth also told Bedell Smith: ""The jury (was) out on whether she likes Meghan.""

1lpdp44,"  I'm one of those people who goes full tunnel vision whenever a new hobby catches my eye. I've flirted with coin collecting, dipped my toes into sneakers, and gotten somewhat into watches (budget's not allowing me to get too deep into this one). But for the past year, it's been all about fragrances—and honestly, aside from watches, this one's been the most fun. I've always had a soft spot for good scents. As a kid, my options were limited to budget bangers like Fogg and Axe. Occasionally, I'd sneak a few sprays from my dad's One Man Show by Jacques Bogart—which, in Bangladesh, was THE dad scent and I still enjoyed it. During my high school and college days, my dad gifted me a few designer fragrances—CK One, CH Men, Givenchy Gentlemen Only Absolute, Boss Bottled EDT, Emporio Armani… lui. I held onto each of them dearly—not just because they were gifts, but because they're what lit the spark. At the time, dropping more than $50 on a fragrance felt like a full-blown luxury. Even a year ago, I'd hesitate before going over $100. But post-graduation, once I landed a job, I figured—why not treat myself? I dove into YouTube reviews, fell hard for the Middle Eastern fragrance hype, and picked up 9PM, Hawas, Khamrah, Bade al Oud the usual suspects. Had a blast with them. Then I ventured into more mainstream designer stuff—Eros, Rabanne Victory Extreme… but they didn't hit like I hoped. That's when I started craving something different—something I hadn't smelled on every guy in a party or hangout . I slowly unfollowed the “Top 10 panty droppers” crowd and moved away from the hype-chasing echo chamber. I began doing my own research, dug into deeper reviews, curbed the blind buys, and started really learning. These days, I enjoy watching folks like Daniel from Seldomly Often, Sebastian from The Perfume Guy, Marcelo from The Niche Fragrance Collector, Justin from The Stay Fresh Production, and Alavi from Persolaise. No fluff, just passion and perspective. What's been especially refreshing is how welcoming the local fragrance community is. Compared to some hobbies that can get a bit… elitist, this one feels more open. Sure, some fragheads can be snobbish too, but I've had pretty smooth sailing so far. So here we are—a year and a month into this olfactory rabbit hole, and I'm loving every step. The failed blind buys, the hype traps, the unexpected gems—it's all part of the ride. I've sold off a few misses, gifted a couple to my brother and dad, and what's left are the ones I actually reach for and enjoy. There are still a few bottles I've got my eye on—ones that feel like missing pieces of my current collection. Once I grab those, I'll probably hit pause for a bit and shift focus to other priorities. Until then, I'll keep enjoying what I've already got on the shelf.","I'm one of those people who goes full tunnel vision whenever a new hobby catches my eye.

mov_AB28BCB31E9E0514AAFCF92C6D454F1F,"  They say, fashion comes its fair share of faux pas and flair! While luxurious wardrobes and style statements speak for the 'flair' part, the faux pas part most certainly includes the mispronunciations of the well-known fashion brands (despite those being extremely famous). And while these mishaps are quite cliché, they're not chic at all. Because let's be honest – in the world of fashion, half the battle is looking the part, and the rest of it is acing the etiquette (which includes the correct pronunciation of popular fashion brands). Mispronouncing a luxury label can cost you credibility faster than you can say “Céline.” Lucky for you, we've done the hard work. From Parisian labels to Italian icons and streetwear staples, this guide is sprinkled with phonetic line-drawing, brand backstories, and quirky insider tips to help you glide through any style conversation with ease. So, say goodbye to awkward pauses and hello to stylish confidence – let's break it down, brand by brand. French elegance: Subtle, chic, and tricky Hermès – Not “Her-meez,” but gentle vowel start, silent 'H' and 's': “air‑MEZ” or “er‑MEZ”, not “her‑meez.” Givenchy – Often butchered as “Gah‑vin‑chee.” The correct French flourish? “zhee‑VOHN‑shee”, with soft 'G', nasal 'on', and a gentle final “‑shee.” Chanel – Forget “Shan‑elle.” The proper style? “SHUH‑nel.” Chic, crisp, simple, and oh-so‑Parisian. Balmain – Yes, it's not “BAL‑mayn.” Roll it out like “bal‑MAH”, trailing off the 'n' softly for that French flair. Yves Saint Laurent – Drop those hard Ts! The smooth version: “EEV san‑loh‑rah(n)”, a lovers' lane nasal finish. Christian Louboutin – Strut smoothly: “kris‑tee‑ahn loo‑boo‑TAHN”, not “tin.” Christian Lacroix – “LA-kwa.” So “kris‑tee‑ahn luh‑kwa”, rolling that l–r combo beautifully. Comme des Garçons – Play it subtly: “comb‑DAY gar‑SON”, letting the 's' fade, nasal 'on' intact. Italian icons: Bold, bright, and vowely Gucci – It's “GOO‑chee”, emphasis on the first syllable, never “Goo‑kee.” Versace – Despite the trendy slip, it's properly “ver‑SAH‑cheh.” Donatella herself has piped up to confirm it. Prada – Simple and sweet: “PRAH‑dah”, sturdy first syllable, light second. Moschino – The fun-filled style comes through in “mos‑KEY‑no”, not “mos‑chee‑no.” Bottega Veneta – Soft and elegant: “boh‑TEH‑gah veh‑NEH‑ta”, a solid roll in every segment. Dolce & Gabbana – Smooth Italian gloss: “DOL‑chay eh ga‑BAN‑eh”, not “Gab‑anna.” Spanish flair and subtle sound Balenciaga – Spanish royalty. Break it into “bah‑LEN‑see‑AH‑gah,” emphasizing the “AH” and smoothing past the “cia.” Loewe – Spanish elegance meets German twist: say “lo‑WEH‑vay”, not “low‑eeve.” Athleisure staples Adidas – A German classic: “AH‑dee‑dahs”, emphasis on the first syllable, founder Adi Dassler's namesake. Nike – Named after the Greek goddess, it's “NY‑kee”, not “Nighk.” Porsche – Elegant German soap-opera: “POR‑shuh”, with a soft “‑uh” ending. Cross-cultural gems Bvlgari (Latin-script brand) – Pronounce “BOOL‑gah‑ree,” highlighting the “u” after “B.” Cartier – Soft, refined: “kar‑tee‑AY”, not “Car‑tee‑er.” Jacquemus – From French fashion forward: “ZHAK‑moose.” Celine – A blend of syllables: “seh‑LEEN,” soft start, piercing end. Nailing the correct pronunciation of a fashion might seem like a superficial conquest – but it isn't just about speaking the name; it's about stepping into the essence of each brand. Elevating your fashion conversations goes beyond clothes – it's about knowing the names and pronouncing them with confidence, creativity, and cultural awareness. From the sonorous softness of French designers to the vibrant clarity of Italian labels, each namescape tells a story – learn the sound, share the style.

She did not specify who this monarch is, but made it clear who she was alluding to. “When we spoke two weeks before the May 19 wedding, Liza had just heard from the Queen. ' The Number One Lady—I call her Jemima—says the jury is out on whether she likes Meghan,'” Anson reportedly said. “My Jemima is very worried. Harry is besotted and weak about women. We hope, but don't quite think she is in love. We think she [Meghan] engineered it all.” It gives one a vivid picture that the Queen was also feeling uneasy behind palace doors, considering that Harry was telling reporters, “I am close to my grandmother, and she is content with this.” Bedell Smith noted, “When I spoke with the Queen, she said she is not at all content.” Anson passed away later in 2020.

In her Royal Extra Substack, Bedell Smith shared insights from a conversation with Lady Elizabeth Anson, Queen Elizabeth's first cousin and longtime confidante, per the Daily Beast. Born at Windsor Castle and having been accustomed to the Queen all her life, Anson told Bedell Smith that two weeks before Harry and Meghan were married in 2018, the Queen had some doubts. She did not specify who this monarch is, but made it clear who she was alluding to. ""When we spoke two weeks before the May 19 wedding, Liza had just heard from the Queen. ' The Number One Lady-I call her Jemima-says the jury is out on whether she likes Meghan,'"" Anson reportedly said. ""My Jemima is very worried. Harry is besotted and weak about women. We hope, but don't quite think she is in love. We think she [Meghan] engineered it all."" It gives one a vivid picture that the Queen was also feeling uneasy behind palace doors, considering that Harry was telling reporters, ""I am close to my grandmother, and she is content with this."" Bedell Smith noted, ""When I spoke with the Queen, she said she is not at all content."" Anson passed away later in 2020. Queen Elizabeth died in September 2022. Another royal biographer, Ingrid Seward, in her book My Mother and I, wrote, ""The queen never voiced her true opinions except to her close confidants, such as Lady Elizabeth Anson, or Liza as she was known to her friends."" . ""She told me that the Queen had made only one remark about Meghan and Harry's wedding and that was that Meghan's Givenchy wedding gown was 'too white,'"" Seward wrote in an excerpt published by The Daily Mail. He added that, in the Queen's view, the choice of gown ""was not appropriate for a divorcee remarrying in church,"" and that she was reportedly unsettled by ""the Disneyesque spectacle of the day itself.""

VOGUE verrät, wie sie jetzt kombiniert werden. Diese 5 Schuhe aus den 80ern liegen jetzt wieder im Trend! Die Mode der 80er-Jahre ist schwer zu vergessen – die Schulterpolster zum Beispiel oder die knalligen Farben. Aber auch die ausgefallenen Schuhe aus dem vergangenen Jahrzehnt sind legendär und werden im Sommer 2025 wieder rauf und runter getragen – darunter Ballerinas, Slingbacks oder zweifarbige Pumps. VOGUE verrät, welche Modelle zurück auf dem Laufsteg – und der Straße – sind und wie sie heute kombiniert werden. 5 Modelle aus den 80ern, die im Sommer 2025 wieder angesagt sind #1 Ballerinas In den 30er-Jahren lancierten Designer:innen wie Christian Dior, Elsa Schiaparelli und Yves Saint Laurent die ersten Ballerinas, die nicht nur für ihre Eleganz, sondern auch für ihren Komfort gefeiert wurden. Später dann, in den 80er-Jahren, war auch Prinzessin Diana ein großer Fan der Silhouette; während Kate Moss und Alexa Chung in den späten 2000er- und frühen 2010er-Jahren zu den Anhängerinnen gehörten. Perry Ellis stellte 1987 ein schlichtes weißes Modell vor, das sie gepaart mit einem weißen, geradlinigen Look über den Laufsteg schickte. Nachdem die Modelle dann einige Jahre von der Bildfläche verschwunden waren, bahnten sie sich in den letzten Saisons ihren Weg zurück an die Spitze. Während in den 80er-Jahren aber vorrangig klassische Designs im Vordergrund standen, zeigen sich die Ballerinas heute verspielter – zum Beispiel aus Mesh oder PVC, mit Leoparden- oder Reptilmuster. Bei Chloé präsentierte Chemena Kamali beispielsweise eine geschnürte Boho-Version der Schuhe, die sie zu einem fließenden roséfarbenen Set kombinierte. #2 Slingbacks Apropos elegante Schuhe: Slingback-Modelle, also jene mit Riemchen um die Ferse, gehörten in den 80er-Jahren zur Arbeitsuniform der Frauen. 1987, als das sogenannte Power-Dressing in vollem Gange war, brauchte man ein Design, das bequem, aber dennoch formell war. So wählte Giorgio Armani für seine Kollektion im besagten Jahr Slingbacks, die er zu einer Bundfaltenhose, einer Bluse und einem Blazer mit breiten Schulterpolstern kombinierte. In 2025 kommen Slingbacks besonders gerne mit Kitten Heels daher – wie Marken wie Jacquemus, Contessa Mills und Tamara Ralph bestätigen. Letztere setzte auf eine schwarze Variante der Slingbacks und kombinierte sie mit einer samtigen Off-Shoulder-Bluse und einem Midirock mit Perlenverzierung. #3 T-Steg-Sandalen Sich von vergangenen Jahrzehnten inspirieren zu lassen, ist kein neues Konzept. Und während die Mode der 80er-Jahre der Welt eine Mischung aus Opulenz, Sinnlichkeit und Dramatik bescherte, brachte sie auch viele Elemente der 20er-Jahre zurück – wie lange Halsketten und T-Steg-Sandalen. Givenchy stellte in 1988 beispielsweise ein mit Polka Dots verziertes Modell vor – in Kombination mit einem trägerlosen Kleid im gleichen Muster. Es gab eine Zeit, in der Schuhe mit T-Steg als altmodisch galten. Jetzt, im Sommer 2025, finden die geschichtsträchtigen und mühelos eleganten Schuhe wieder Anklang. Christopher Esber, eine Marke mit australischen Wurzeln, verlieh ihnen mit einer Mesh-Variante und gestylt zum minimalistischen Ensemble aus einem weißen Neckholdertop und einer schwarzen Stoffhose einen modernen Dreh. #4 Oxford-Schuhe In den späten 80er-Jahren begann sich langsam der Minimalismus, der die nächsten Jahre prägen sollte, zu etablieren. Ein Stil, der sich durch androgyne Accessoires – wie zum Beispiel die Oxford-Schuhe – bemerkbar machte. Ralph Lauren hatte sie 1985 bereits mit Absatz vorgestellt; Helmut Lang und Yohji Yamamoto verwischten die Geschlechtergrenzen dann mit Versionen, die fast identisch zu den Herrenschuhen waren. Lang kombinierte sie mit einem langärmeligen Rollkragenkleid, Yamamoto mit einer weißen Oversize-Weste und einem blauen Satinrock. Oxford-Schuhe zogen sich wie ein roter Faden durch die Frühjahr/Sommer-Kollektion 2025 von Loewe. Anstatt sie wie damals zu ebenso androgynen Looks zu stylen, sorgte Jonathan Anderson für einen Stilbruch und kombinierte sie zu romantisch-verspielten Blumen- und Babydoll-Kleidern. #5 Zweifarbige Pumps Das Chanel der 80er-Jahre verkörperte einen Luxus, der sich durch Tweed-Sets, Perlenschmuck – und zweifarbige Pumps auszeichnete. Gründerin Coco Chanel trug oft selbst ein Paar mit niedrigem Absatz. 1982 (ein Jahr bevor Karl Lagerfeld zum französischen Modehaus stieß) sah man zweifarbige Pumps in Kombination mit einem weißen Kleid, einem schwarzen Blazer, Handschuhen, Gürteln und langen Perlenketten auf dem Laufsteg. Während diese klassischen schwarz-cremefarbenen Pumps weiterhin bei Chanel zu sehen sind, gibt es Häuser wie Nina Ricci oder Balmain, die die zweifarbigen Modelle ausgefallener – aber immer noch im gleichen Stil – interpretieren. Balmain setzte für den Sommer 2025 beispielsweise auf eine rot-goldene Version, gepaart mit einem Tweed-Minirock und einer passenden Jacke.","SPR_COMBO[de]Ob zweifarbige Pumps oder T-Steg-Sandalen: Einige Schuhe aus den 80er-Jahren erleben in 2025 ein Comeback.

526f67f3173ee2c07beda12ea74f5cb0,"  The late Queen Elizabeth allegedly 'saw through' Meghan Markle, and claimed her romance with Harry had become a 'complete catastrophe', just weeks before her death in September 2021. Prince Harry and his wife have always been at pains to stress that they enjoyed a warm bond with the late Queen, despite a rift with the other senior royals that has only deepened over the years. However, this week the Sussexes up and down relationship with the late Queen was revealed by journalist and royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith on her Substack Royal Extras , after her conversations with Her Majesty's late cousin Lady Elizabeth Anson. Lady Eliza, as she was known to friends, told Ms Bedell Smith that Harry had been 'rude' to his grandmother for 10 minutes during a meeting about his wedding and Meghan refused to disclose details of her dress, leaving the monarch 'saddened'. Her comments echo claims made previously in the Spectator magazine, that relations between Meghan, Harry and his grandmother were rather more complicated than the Sussexes have made out. According to a source, the Queen made some strongly-worded remarks about Meghan and Harry's union to guests at Balmoral just a month before she died. The source said: 'It was out of character for the Queen...but she saw straight through Meghan. ' At the drinks before the dinner, a small group were talking to the monarch and she explained that Harry meeting Meghan had become a complete catastrophe. Queen Elizabeth II and Meghan at an event in Cheshire in June 2018. During Meghan's brief time as a working royal, the Duchess and the Queen found themselves at loggerheads Meghan at the Queen's funeral. The late Queen allegedly described Meghan as 'evil' 'By this point we all knew the Queen's health was in decline and she had months left, she seemed regretful about how things had panned out.' By this stage, Harry and Meghan had stepped down as working royals and were living a new life in Montecito. When 'Megxit' was announced in January 2020, the late monarch released a statement saying: 'Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family.' That is not to say that relations between the couple and the monarch were always on an amicable footing with things beginning to sour during the planning of the couple's wedding, according to Lady Liza Anson. Born in Windsor Castle, Lady Elizabeth, a great-niece of the Queen Mother and a goddaughter of King George VI, was a high-society party planner. The Queen's first cousin, who arranged the Queen's 80th birthday party, allegedly said just days before Meghan and Harry's wedding: 'We hope but don't quite think she is in love. We think she engineered it all.' Meghan was apparently 'full of charm' and appeared 'natural, intelligent, and thoughtful' after she became engaged to Harry in 2017. But as the wedding approached, Meghan allegedly became increasingly 'bossy' and Liza said the Queen was privately 'very worried'. Ms Bedell Smith wrote: 'When we spoke two weeks before the May 19 wedding, Liza had just heard from the Queen. “The Number One Lady—I call her Jemima—says the jury is out on whether she likes Meghan,” said Liza. “My Jemima is very worried.” In Liza's view, “Harry is besotted and weak about women. Liza apparently said: 'It's worrying that so many people are questioning whether Meghan is right for Harry. The problem, bless his heart, is that Harry is neither bright nor strong, and she is both'. The cracks apparently appeared in February 2018. Liza claimed Harry wrote to her and said that his grandmother was 'content' with the way the wedding plans were coming along. But Sally Bedell Smith wrote that Liza had said: 'When I spoke with the Queen, she said she is not at all content'. Ms Bedell Smith wrote: 'According to Liza, the Queen was dismayed that Harry had asked the Archbishop of Canterbury to perform the wedding service in St. George's Chapel without first requesting permission from the Dean of Windsor. “Harry seems to think the Queen can do what she wants, but she can't,” said Liza. “On the religious side, it is the Dean of Windsor's jurisdiction.” As a result, Liza said that “Harry has blown his relationship with his grandmother. She said she was really upset. I was shocked when the Queen told me this, how she was so saddened. I had no idea about the conversation, that he was rude to her for ten minutes. They had tea with her the day before yesterday. She was trying to find out about the wedding dress, and Meghan wouldn't tell her.” .' Liza at this point predicted that Meghan could 'turn into nothing but trouble', remarking that the Suits actress 'sees things in a different way'. Following these February rows, towards the end of April, Liza claimed that “the Queen and Harry have patched things up'. Harry apparently visited her alone to smooth things over and later wrote to with more wedding details. Sally Bedell Smith wrote: 'Liza also said that Meghan's father, Thomas Markle, was “frightened of coming to the wedding.” I asked her if Meghan was being bossy. “So I gather,” Liza replied, “Very much so.” ' My Jemima is very worried', Liza apparently added.

New reports claim the late Queen called their relationship a ""complete catastrophe"" in what insiders say was an uncharacteristically blunt moment from the monarch. Meghan Markle spotted humbly serving the Royal Family in rare look at family life Despite public efforts by the Sussexes to portray a warm relationship with the late Queen , royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith has shed new light on behind-the-scenes tensions, revealing that Elizabeth ""saw through Meghan "" and expressed deep disappointment over how things had unfolded between Harry and his wife. Bedell Smith published the claims in her Royal Extras Substack, citing personal conversations with Lady Elizabeth Anson , the Queen's late cousin and confidante, also known to friends as Lady Liza . According to her, Queen Elizabeth appeared both regretful and saddened during a pre-dinner conversation at Balmoral, where she discussed Harry's marriage in unusually candid terms. ""It was out of character for the Queen ,"" a source told Bedell Smith. ""But she saw straight through Meghan ."" Queen's concern about Meghan's influence and Harry's judgment Lady Liza , a highly connected member of the royal family and a former party planner for the Queen's 80th birthday, confided that tensions had emerged as early as the couple's wedding planning in 2018. She said Harry had been ""rude"" to his grandmother during a 10-minute meeting and that Meghan had refused to share details about her dress with the Queen , leaving her upset. In a particularly pointed remark, Liza reportedly told Bedell Smith just two weeks before the wedding, ""We hope but don't quite think she is in love. We think she engineered it all."" The Queen , according to Liza , was ""very worried,"" particularly as Meghan's behavior shifted from being charming and thoughtful to increasingly controlling. Liza also claimed that Harry had bypassed royal protocol by requesting that the Archbishop of Canterbury conduct the wedding without first consulting the Dean of Windsor . The Queen was ""dismayed"" by this, she said. The Queen allegedly remarked that Meghan's Givenchy gown was ""too white"" for a second wedding, believing it inappropriate for a divorcée marrying in church. Liza's verdict on Harry was no less severe: ""He is neither bright nor strong, and she is both."" She predicted trouble ahead for the marriage and described Meghan as someone who ""sees things in a different way."" Lilibet name dispute and Megxit's collapse Tensions only escalated after the wedding. The Queen reportedly reacted with dismay when the Sussexes named their daughter Lilibet , a personal childhood nickname used only by close family. ""I don't own the palaces, I don't own the paintings, the only thing I own is my name. And now they've taken that,"" the Queen is said to have told an aide. Though Harry and Meghan insisted they had received the Queen's blessing, insiders dispute this, and Robert Hardman , in his biography of King Charles , claimed that the Queen was ""as angry as I'd ever seen her"" following the announcement. The Queen's initial hope for a compromise arrangement during the Sussexes' royal departure - known as ""Megxit"" - also fell apart. Author Valentine Low wrote that Meghan's desire to earn money independently clashed with palace expectations for working royals. In the Queen's view, if they could not abide by the restrictions on commercial activity, they could not continue representing the Crown in any capacity. In the final years of her reign, Queen Elizabeth II remained committed to the monarchy's image, even at the cost of personal relationships. While her public messages maintained a tone of affection - stating that "" Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family"" before Lilibet was born - the private remarks emerging now suggest a more complicated and painful story behind closed doors.","J ust a month before her passing in September 2022, Queen Elizabeth II reportedly shared her true feelings about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in a private conversation at Balmoral. New reports claim the late Queen called their relationship a ""complete catastrophe"" in what insiders say was an uncharacteristically blunt moment from the monarch. Meghan Markle spotted humbly serving the Royal Family in rare look at family life Despite public efforts by the Sussexes to portray a warm relationship with the late Queen , royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith has shed new light on behind-the-scenes tensions, revealing that Elizabeth ""saw through Meghan "" and expressed deep disappointment over how things had unfolded between Harry and his wife. Bedell Smith published the claims in her Royal Extras Substack, citing personal conversations with Lady Elizabeth Anson , the Queen's late cousin and confidante, also known to friends as Lady Liza . According to her, Queen Elizabeth appeared both regretful and saddened during a pre-dinner conversation at Balmoral, where she discussed Harry's marriage in unusually candid terms. ""It was out of character for the Queen ,"" a source told Bedell Smith. ""But she saw straight through Meghan .""

Paris Haute Couture Week is back with a bang, kicking off July's Fall 2025 couture shows with Schiaparelli's star-studded runway. Daniel Roseberry's “Back to the Future” collection explored Elsa Schiaparelli's signature designs from the 1930's with added glamour and futuristic flair, from metallic biker shoulders to a bejeweled anatomical heart, gleaming eye embroidery, and an array of flooring sheer-paneled silk gowns. Naturally, the occasion was witnessed by a chic crowd including Dua Lipa, Cardi B, Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, Karol G, and Hunter Schafer. But that's just the tip of the haute couture iceberg! As the shows continue from July 7 to 10, keep an eye out for new collections from Chanel, Giorgio Armani Privé, Giambattista Valli, Robert Wun, Maison Margiela, Georges Hobeika, and Germanier—plus Demna's final collection for Balenciaga! Daniel Roseberry (Courtesy) All images: Courtesy of Schiaparelli Anne Hathaway Blossoms In Sarah Burton's Givenchy For Vogue's August Issue Anne Hathaway is in full bloom for her latest Vogue cover! The actress fronts the magazine's August 2025 issue in a new editorial exclusively styled by Tabitha Simmons, wearing nine looks from Sarah Burton's debut Givenchy Fall 2025 collection. For her shoot by Annie Leibovitz, Hathaway takes Burton's celebrated creations on a journey through New York City, including Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. While speaking with Maya Singer for her feature interview, Hathaway also chats about her new film Mother Mary, feeling like a “beginner” in her role as its titular pop star in crisis, and her new chapter of wide-ranging projects in the 2020's (which will also include new Princess Diaries and Devil Wears Prada sequels!) . “What struck me right away, reading the script, is that you can't 'perform' Mother Mary,” said Hathaway. “If I got the part, I would have to become material David could craft with. I had to submit to being a beginner. The humility of that—showing up every day knowing you're going to suck. And it has to be okay. You're not 'bad.' You're just a beginner. Getting to that mindset—I had to shed some things that were hard to shed. It was welcome. But it was hard, the way transformational experiences can be hard.” All images: Annie Leibovitz JW Anderson Steps Back From Runways—And Steps Into Home Design Jonathan Anderson's namesake JW Anderson brand is taking a break from the runway, According to Dazed, the beloved designer's eclectic label is stopping its seasonal runway shows and largely stepping back from releasing large fashion collections. Instead, the brand will focusing on creating accessories, staple fashion pieces, and luxury home goods—as well as expanding its retail footprint with new stores in New York, Paris, Belgravia, and Pimlico. Anderson's new Resort 2026 collection is the first to introduce the concept, featuring a thinner J.W. Anderson logo across the designer's signature whimsical knits and denim. His ready-to-wear pieces are paired with a range of his favorite curated objects, including re-editions of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's oak lamps and stools, curated books, vintage gardening tools, Lucie Rie mugs, Murano glassware, Jason Mosseri's Hope Spring chairs, Akiko Hirai's ceramics, Welsh blankets, hand-forged nails, Houghton Hall Estate honey, and Postcard Teas' coffee-flavored tea. For a personal touch, all are shown in the brand's new lookbook, featuring a cast of JWA collaborators and friends like Joe Alwyn, Bella Freud, Ben Whishaw, Luca Guadagnino, and more.

The comedian and actress, known for her viral character videos and standout appearance on Hacks, is heading across the pond for her latest project: Lena Dunham's new rom-com Netflix series Too Much, out July 10. In her new cover story, Stalter dramatically poses in both glittering jewels and a bedazzled swimsuit—winking to American casual and formal British fashions—for photographer Luke Gilford. Her accompanying interview with Lindy Segal finds Stalter opening up on her first leading role, as well as growing up in Ohio, playing “talentless” characters, and approaching nudity onscreen. “I personally didn't feel the need to go fully topless,” Stalter says. “It all made sense to me without [nudity], and I never felt any pressure that it was needed. I kind of feel like it's empowering not to.” Megan Stalter Megan Stalter All images: Luke Gilford Alexis Bittar Is Directing A New Kind Of Documentary Alexis Bittar is joining the world of documentaries—though this one strays far from fashion.

Star appearances within the flick will include Marc Jacobs, Isaac Mizrahi, Jenna Lyons, George Takei, King Princess, Symone, Bill T.

Hoy en día, el magnetismo personal, la actitud, la trayectoria profesional e incluso el estilo de vida influyen en la percepción pública. En un momento donde las redes sociales, las plataformas de streaming y los grandes eventos marcan la pauta, algunos nombres destacan no solo por su talento, sino por ese halo irresistible que los convierte en auténticos iconos de seducción. A continuación, presentamos un ranking de los famosos más atractivos del momento, tanto dentro como fuera de España, que dominan titulares, alfombras rojas y corazones por igual. Para realizar este artículo hemos utilizado la ayuda del ChatGPT, una herramienta que funciona con inteligencia artificial. 1-Manu Ríos Desde que se hizo mundialmente conocido por su papel en Élite, Manu Ríos no ha dejado de escalar en el mundo de la moda, el entretenimiento y las redes sociales. Su elegancia natural y su estilo andrógino lo han llevado a protagonizar campañas para firmas como Balmain, Givenchy o Dior, consolidándose como un referente estético para las nuevas generaciones. 2-Ester Expósito Pocas actrices españolas han causado tanto impacto mediático en tan poco tiempo como Ester Expósito. Su papel en Élite fue solo el inicio de una carrera que no ha dejado de evolucionar, y su presencia en alfombras rojas internacionales la ha convertido en una auténtica embajadora del glamour. Más allá de sus rasgos delicados y su porte elegante, Ester desprende seguridad, intensidad y una energía arrolladora que la ha colocado entre las mujeres más deseadas del mundo. En redes sociales supera los 30 millones de seguidores, una cifra que habla de su impacto más allá de la pantalla. 3-Michele Morrone El actor y cantante italiano Michele Morrone alcanzó fama mundial gracias a su papel en la trilogía erótica 365 DNI, pero desde entonces ha demostrado que su talento va mucho más allá de la estética. Su físico imponente, su mirada penetrante y su voz grave lo han convertido en un icono de sensualidad, pero también en un artista completo. 4-Ana de Armas Cuba y España se dan la mano en la figura de Ana de Armas, una actriz que ha conquistado Hollywood con su belleza hipnótica y su talento frente a las cámaras. Desde Knives Out hasta Blonde, pasando por la saga de James Bond, ha dejado claro que su presencia no es casualidad. Ana combina un rostro de belleza singular con una carrera cuidadosamente trazada, y eso la convierte en una de las actrices más codiciadas del momento. 5-Mario Casas Mario Casas ha sido, durante más de una década, uno de los actores más deseados del panorama español y en 2025 su popularidad sigue intacta. Con una imagen más madura y una carrera consolidada, el intérprete ha sabido reinventarse, alejándose del estereotipo adolescente que lo lanzó a la fama en Tres metros sobre el cielo. Su cuerpo trabajado, su voz rasgada y su actitud desenfadada siguen generando suspiros, pero también lo ha hecho su evolución profesional. Mario se ha ganado el respeto del sector con papeles complejos y arriesgados, lo que ha reforzado su atractivo como hombre completo: seductor, comprometido y cercano. 6-Zendaya No hay alfombra roja, portada de revista ni desfile donde Zendaya pase desapercibida. La actriz y cantante estadounidense ha redefinido lo que significa ser atractiva en la era actual: segura de sí misma, multifacética y con un estilo que oscila entre lo urbano y lo vanguardista. 7-Álex González Con más de dos décadas de carrera a sus espaldas, Álex González sigue siendo uno de los hombres más atractivos del panorama nacional. Su participación en series como El Príncipe o Toy Boy lo han mantenido en el foco, y su físico imponente, combinado con una mirada intensa, le otorgan un aura de galán clásico. Fuera de la pantalla, Álex ha sabido mantener un perfil bajo, lo que le ha conferido cierto aire de misterio. Sus apariciones públicas son siempre medidas, pero cuando lo hace, acapara todas las miradas. El equilibrio entre lo reservado y lo apasionado lo coloca en esta lista sin discusión. 8-Timothée Chalamet Delicado, creativo, enigmático. Timothée Chalamet no responde a los cánones tradicionales de belleza masculina, y tal vez por eso genera tanta fascinación. El actor franco-estadounidense ha conquistado tanto a la crítica como al público joven gracias a su sensibilidad, su versatilidad interpretativa y su capacidad de expresar emoción con una sola mirada. 9-Blanca Suárez Pocas actrices nacionales combinan belleza, elegancia y carisma como Blanca Suárez. Su carrera se ha movido entre la televisión, el cine y la moda, pero ha sido su personalidad —desenfadada, directa, sin artificios— la que la ha convertido en un referente de atractivo natural. 10-Henry Cavill Aunque su fama se consolidó como Superman, Henry Cavill ha demostrado ser mucho más que un rostro esculpido. Su porte británico, su voz grave y su presencia imponente lo convierten en un ícono de masculinidad clásica, pero con una dimensión moderna que lo hace irresistible.","SPR_COMBO[es]En OKDIARIO hemos utilizado la inteligencia artificial para responder a una pregunta interesante Tenemos un ranking para catalogar a los famsosos más atractivos del momento El atractivo no depende únicamente de su apariencia física.

The actor, who broke through on the Regency-era Netflix series Bridgerton, has joined the cast of Darrah Cloud's House of McQueen as the titular Lee Alexander McQueen. The off-Broadway production following the life and career of the famed designer will open at the Mansion at Hudson Yards later this summer. “It is our absolute pleasure to announce Luke's involvement with House of McQueen,” executive producer Rick Lazes said, per Deadline. “We can't think of anyone better suited to bring Lee's story to life than this incredibly impressive multi-hyphenate.” Newton revealed news of the role on Instagram, where he posted three photos of McQueen, who died in 2010 at the age of 40. “It is the story of a boy born in the east end of London, who literally wears his heart on his sleeve, never meant to rise beyond his working-class family,” an official synopsis of the play reads. “From making doll clothes for his mother's friends to working in a tailor shop, he rises to the top of the fashion industry as chief designer for Givenchy and head of his own legendary fashion line, as his fashion shows become theatrical and artistic spectacles, attracting countless celebrities.” It continues: “Seeking to find beauty in the most devastating aspects of life, McQueen envisions and creates clothes to empower women in response to what is happening in his life and the world around him. Fighting against the commercial interests of legendary houses like Givenchy and Gucci to remain provocative, he challenges norms and pushes boundaries as an artist. In the end, the fight consumes him.” House of McQueen was written by Cloud and will be directed by Sam Helfrich. It will be the first production to grace the stage at The Mansion, which will open for previews on Aug. 19 and officially begin on Sept. 9. Newton's return to theater follows his stints in the West End production of The Book of Mormon and Neil LaBute's The Shape of Things.","Luke Newton at British Vogue/Netflix event for BAFTA Television Awards on May 8, 2025. - Credit: Jed Cullen/Dave Benett/ Luke Newton is stepping into the world of fashion with some major shoes to fill.

The Princess of Wales, 43, joined members of the British royal family at a state banquet on July 8, held to honor French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, during their state visit to the U.K. The Windsor Castle event was also attended by Prince William, King Charles and Queen Camilla, who all dressed the part for the regal occasion. Princess Kate wore what has become her go-to royal headpiece, Queen Mary's Lover's Knot Tiara, with a caped red dress designed by Sarah Burton for Givenchy, her royal wedding dress designer. The Prince and Princess of Wales also snapped a sweet photo glammed up together that they shared on social media. ""Ready for what promises to be a wonderful State Banquet this evening in Windsor,"" they wrote. Princess Kate has not worn a tiara since December 2023 when she slipped on the Queen Mary's Lover's Knot Tiara for the annual Diplomatic Reception at Buckingham Palace. She paired the headtopper with her pink Jenny Packham gown, a complete repeat of her look at the Jordan royal wedding earlier that year. Her last state banquet appearance was in November 2023 during the President and First Lady of South Korea's state visit. There, she slipped on the Strathmore Rose Tiara, which hadn't been worn since the 1930s. Since marrying Prince William in 2011, Princess Kate has worn four different tiaras from the royal collection on numerous occasions. The reason for Kate's tiara hiatus is partially due to her stepping out of the spotlight for most of 2024 while she focused on cancer treatment. Although the Princess of Wales did not don a tiara during the Qatar state visit in December, she did participate in the occasion. In a rare appearance, she joined Prince William in welcoming the Amir of the State of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, and his wife, Her Highness Sheikha Jawaher bint Hamad bin Suhaim Al Thani, on Dec. 3. However, she did not attend the state banquet with other royals later that evening. Chris Jackson/Getty Prince William and Kate Middleton at Windsor Castle state banquet on July 8, 2025 Princess Kate announced in January that she is in remission but is still working to balance her public duties with her recovery. She recently spoke about the ""really difficult"" phase after treatment during her July 2 Colchester Hospital visit. ""You put on a sort of brave face, stoicism through treatment. Treatment's done, then it's like, 'I can crack on, get back to normal,' but actually, the phase afterwards is really, really difficult,"" she said during the outing. At the state banquet, held at Windsor Castle for the first time in 11 years, King Charles and President Macron led the royal procession, followed by Queen Camilla and Brigitte. The Prince of Wales was next in the lineup beside Professor Edith Heard, while the Princess of Wales was right behind her husband with Christophe Leribault. Prince Edward and Sophie, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, also joined the evening banquet as well as Princess Anne, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and more members of the royal family. All aspects of the event were thoughtfully planned with touches related to France and the attendees. After dinner, guests were served Taylor's 1977 Vintage Port and a 1948 Grande Champagne Cognac by Frapin & Co, reflecting the years of President Macron's and King Charles' births. A cocktail was also created for the occasion: called ""L'entente,"" it combines British gin with lemon curd and French pastis, garnished with dried French cornflowers and English roses. Flowers from the gardens at Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle were hand-picked and used in the centerpieces. Any flowers that can't be reused will be donated to the charity Floral Angels, of which Queen Camilla is a patron, to be delivered to hospices, elderly care homes, shelters and other locations in the community.

The royal couple greeted the Macrons at RAF Northolt, an airbase located in Greater London, before they all traveled to Windsor together for a formal welcome from King Charles and Queen Camilla.

The flowing silk creponne gathered evening gown featured a cape back detailing. The Princess paired it with an evening clutch embroidered with a lily of the valley motif as well as the Lover's Knot Tiara. The diadem, made by the House of Garrard in 1913, consists of diamonds and a collection of 19 hanging pearls set in silver and gold. The Lover's Knot was also a favorite of the late Princess Diana. The Princess of Wales's choice of Sarah Burton for Givenchy is a clear statement of fashion diplomacy: a design by a British woman for a French fashion house, it serves as a sartorial symbol of the symbiotic relationship between the two European countries. It is also a moment that will excite followers of the fashion industry. Dressing the Princess for the state banquet is one of the highest-profile moments thus far for Burton during her tenure as Givenchy's creative director. Her appointment was announced in September 2024 and her debut collection was shown in March 2025. Previously, Elle Fanning wore one of her designs to the Oscars, as did Cynthia Erivo to the 2025 Tony Awards. It also further cements Middleton's role as a perennial muse for Burton. The designer was the creative mastermind behind the royal's now iconic ivory lace wedding dress, which she wore to marry Prince William at Westminster Abbey in 2011. She also designed three separate looks for the Princess's ethereal birthday portraits. Like Queen Elizabeth's longstanding relationship with British fashion designer Norman Hartnell, it seems that Sarah Burton and the Princess of Wales will continue to etch their fashion story together.","Tonight, the Princess of Wales made a statement in a dark red Givenchy by Sarah Burton gown to a state banquet at Windsor Castle honoring French President Emmanuel Macron.

The bold red hue of her gown echoed one of France's national colors, and her clutch embroidered with lily of the valley carried layers of symbolism: the flower traditionally represents happiness, humility, and motherhood, and in France, it's gifted on May 1 (La Fête du Muguet) as a token of luck and renewal. Christian Dior himself considered it his lucky bloom, frequently incorporating it into his designs. Completing the look were a series of high honors and sashes — visual reminders of Kate's evolving senior role in the royal family.

The Princess of Wales, 43, joined Prince William, King Charles, Queen Camilla and more members of the royal family at Windsor Castle on July 8 for the state banquet honoring French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, as part of their state visit to the U.K. The outing marked Kate's first time attending a state banquet since 2023, as she missed two similar events last year as she focused on her cancer treatment out of the public eye. In addition to wearing her first tiara in a year and a half, Princess Kate also debuted her Royal Family Order of King Charles III. She pinned the badge featuring a miniature portrait of her father-in-law with a pale blue ribbon on her sash, just above the late Queen Elizabeth's Royal Family Order. Queen Camilla previously wore the King's Royal Family Order at the Japan state visit in June 2024, making her the first person to wear it. She wore the piece again at the France state banquet.

Family Orders have since been instituted by Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, King George V, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II."" The honor was specially created for women in 1821, in part because only men could receive many honors. The Family Order is personally given out by the monarch without consultation with the government, traditionally after a female royal has been acting as a working member of the family for several years. Princess Kate has slowly returned to her royal duties since announcing in January that she is in remission. However, she is still working to balance her public duties with her recovery and recently spoke about the ""really difficult"" phase that follows treatment during her visit to Colchester Hospital on July 2. ""You put on a sort of brave face, stoicism through treatment.

The evening marked the start of the French state visit, and of course, all eyes were on Kate as she strutted down the grand banquet hall.

A British designer crafting a gown in collaboration with a French fashion house? Sounds like diplomacy to us. But, apart from the hidden meaning behind her choice, the gown was quite a gorgeous masterpiece too.The silk creponne dress featured a dramatic cape-style back and a perfectly tailored waist that flared into a soft pleated skirt. It was glamorous without being too over the top, a look that Kate is best known for. And, as if the look wasn't striking enough on it's own, her accessories told a rich story too. Perched atop her head was the Lover's Knot tiara, a piece that once belonged to Princess Diana and was originally made for Queen Mary back in 1913. It is also one of Kate's most treasured and worn pieces, although this seems to be her first major tiara moment since 2023. For more sparkle, the Princess of Wales put on the diamond chandelier earrings from the late Queen Elizabeth's collection, while a dainty clutch embroidered with lily of the valley flowers expertly complimented the look.

(Jemal Countess/WireImage for Saks Fifth Ave – NY) An off-Broadway play celebrating the life and career of gay fashion designer Alexander McQueen, titled House of McQueen, is in the works, and a Bridgerton star is set to portray the late icon. On Tuesday (8 July), Deadline reported that none other than actor Luke Newton will be stepping into McQueen's metaphorical dress shoes in the production, House of McQueen. The out gay fashion designer died in 2010 at the age of 40. Newton is best known for his role as Colin Bridgerton in the Netflix series, who was the star couple in season three, alongside Nicola Coughlan's Penelope Featherington. Luke Newton is set to portray the late gay fashion star. (Jed Cullen/Dave Benett/ for British Vogue) The official synopsis for the play reads: “House of McQueen is a new Off-Broadway play about the life and work of iconic fashion designer Alexander McQueen as told from his own revolutionary, daring and elegant perspective. It is the story of a boy born in the East End of London, who literally wears his heart on his sleeve, never meant to rise beyond his working-class family. “From making doll clothes for his mother's friends to working in a tailor shop, he rises to the top of the fashion industry as chief designer for Givenchy and head of his own legendary fashion line, as his fashion shows become theatrical and artistic spectacles, attracting countless celebrities. “Seeking to find beauty in the most devastating aspects of life, McQueen envisions and creates clothes to empower women in response to what is happening in his life and the world around him. Fighting against the commercial interests of legendary houses like Givenchy and Gucci to remain provocative, he challenges norms and pushes boundaries as an artist. In the end, the fight consumes him.” Directing House of McQueen is Angels in America director Sam Helfrich, while Rick Lazes (Lennox Lewis: The Untold Story), and McQueen's nephew, Gary James, are both joining as executive producer and creative director, respectively. The rest of the cast for the show is yet to be announced. Newton is not the only Bridgerton star to appear on stage after starring in the steamy period drama. His co-star, Jonathan Bailey, who plays his on-screen older brother Viscount Anthony Bridgerton, has been praised for his turn in the Shakespeare classic, Richard II. Meanwhile, other series stars, including Adoja Andoh, Luke Thompson, Golda Rosheuvel, and Regé-Jean Page, have an impressive collection of theatre credits. Previews for House of McQueen are set to launch at The Mansion at Hudson Yards, New York, on 19 August. The official opening is set for 9 September. Share your thoughts!

It is the story of a boy born in the East End of London, who literally wears his heart on his sleeve, never meant to rise beyond his working-class family. “From making doll clothes for his mother's friends to working in a tailor shop, he rises to the top of the fashion industry as chief designer for Givenchy and head of his own legendary fashion line, as his fashion shows become theatrical and artistic spectacles, attracting countless celebrities. “Seeking to find beauty in the most devastating aspects of life, McQueen envisions and creates clothes to empower women in response to what is happening in his life and the world around him. Fighting against the commercial interests of legendary houses like Givenchy and Gucci to remain provocative, he challenges norms and pushes boundaries as an artist. In the end, the fight consumes him.” Directing House of McQueen is Angels in America director Sam Helfrich, while Rick Lazes (Lennox Lewis: The Untold Story), and McQueen's nephew, Gary James, are both joining as executive producer and creative director, respectively. The rest of the cast for the show is yet to be announced. Newton is not the only Bridgerton star to appear on stage after starring in the steamy period drama. His co-star, Jonathan Bailey, who plays his on-screen older brother Viscount Anthony Bridgerton, has been praised for his turn in the Shakespeare classic, Richard II. Meanwhile, other series stars, including Adoja Andoh, Luke Thompson, Golda Rosheuvel, and Regé-Jean Page, have an impressive collection of theatre credits. Previews for House of McQueen are set to launch at The Mansion at Hudson Yards, New York, on 19 August. The official opening is set for 9 September. Share your thoughts!

Prince Harry and his wife have always been at pains to stress that they enjoyed a warm bond with the late Queen, despite a rift with the other senior royals that has only deepened over the years. However, this week the Sussexes up and down relationship with the late Queen was revealed by journalist and royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith on her Substack Royal Extras, after her conversations with Her Majesty's late cousin Lady Elizabeth Anson. Lady Eliza, as she was known to friends, told Ms Bedell Smith that Harry had been 'rude' to his grandmother for 10 minutes during a meeting about his wedding and Meghan refused to disclose details of her dress, leaving the monarch 'saddened'. Her comments echo claims made previously in the Spectator magazine, that relations between Meghan, Harry and his grandmother were rather more complicated than the Sussexes have made out. According to a source, the Queen made some strongly-worded remarks about Meghan and Harry's union to guests at Balmoral just a month before she died. The source said: 'It was out of character for the Queen...but she saw straight through Meghan. 'At the drinks before the dinner, a small group were talking to the monarch and she explained that Harry meeting Meghan had become a complete catastrophe. Queen Elizabeth II and Meghan at an event in Cheshire in June 2018. During Meghan's brief time as a working royal, the Duchess and the Queen found themselves at loggerheads Meghan at the Queen's funeral. The late Queen allegedly described Meghan as 'evil' TRENDING 'By this point we all knew the Queen's health was in decline and she had months left, she seemed regretful about how things had panned out.' By this stage, Harry and Meghan had stepped down as working royals and were living a new life in Montecito. When 'Megxit' was announced in January 2020, the late monarch released a statement saying: 'Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family.' That is not to say that relations between the couple and the monarch were always on an amicable footing with things beginning to sour during the planning of the couple's wedding, according to Lady Liza Anson. Born in Windsor Castle, Lady Elizabeth, a great-niece of the Queen Mother and a goddaughter of King George VI, was a high-society party planner. SCROLL DOWN TO CONTINUE ARTICLE The Queen's first cousin, who arranged the Queen's 80th birthday party, allegedly said just days before Meghan and Harry's wedding: 'We hope but don't quite think she is in love. We think she engineered it all.' Meghan was apparently 'full of charm' and appeared 'natural, intelligent, and thoughtful' after she became engaged to Harry in 2017. But as the wedding approached, Meghan allegedly became increasingly 'bossy' and Liza said the Queen was privately 'very worried'. Ms Bedell Smith wrote: 'When we spoke two weeks before the May 19 wedding, Liza had just heard from the Queen. “The Number One Lady—I call her Jemima—says the jury is out on whether she likes Meghan,” said Liza. “My Jemima is very worried.” In Liza's view, “Harry is besotted and weak about women. Liza apparently said: 'It's worrying that so many people are questioning whether Meghan is right for Harry. The problem, bless his heart, is that Harry is neither bright nor strong, and she is both'. The cracks apparently appeared in February 2018. Liza claimed Harry wrote to her and said that his grandmother was 'content' with the way the wedding plans were coming along. But Sally Bedell Smith wrote that Liza had said: 'When I spoke with the Queen, she said she is not at all content'. Ms Bedell Smith wrote: 'According to Liza, the Queen was dismayed that Harry had asked the Archbishop of Canterbury to perform the wedding service in St. George's Chapel without first requesting permission from the Dean of Windsor. “Harry seems to think the Queen can do what she wants, but she can't,” said Liza. “On the religious side, it is the Dean of Windsor's jurisdiction.” As a result, Liza said that “Harry has blown his relationship with his grandmother. She said she was really upset. I was shocked when the Queen told me this, how she was so saddened. I had no idea about the conversation, that he was rude to her for ten minutes. They had tea with her the day before yesterday. She was trying to find out about the wedding dress, and Meghan wouldn't tell her.” .' Liza at this point predicted that Meghan could 'turn into nothing but trouble', remarking that the Suits actress 'sees things in a different way'. Hosted by Royal Historians Robert Hardman and Professor Kate Williams, Queens, Kings, and Dastardly Things looks at the Royal Family - the secrets, the palace intrigues, and the Crown's bloodiest moments. Following these February rows, towards the end of April, Liza claimed that “the Queen and Harry have patched things up'. Harry apparently visited her alone to smooth things over and later wrote to with more wedding details. Sally Bedell Smith wrote: 'Liza also said that Meghan's father, Thomas Markle, was “frightened of coming to the wedding.” I asked her if Meghan was being bossy. “So I gather,” Liza replied, “Very much so.” 'My Jemima is very worried', Liza apparently added.

Emmanuel Macron was welcomed to Windsor Castle for a glittering banquet on Tuesday, as he was pictured clinking glasses and winking at royals. The French president sat amongst the likes of Mick Jagger and Elton John at the star-studded event on the first day of his state visit to the UK. The Princess of Wales was dressed in a dark red silk Givenchy gown as she sat next to Mr Macron for her first state banquet since her cancer diagnosis. The president was pictured winking and chatting with Kate as she sat next to Mr Macron wearing her favourite Lover's Knot tiara – a piece much loved by Diana, Princess of Wales. The princess and and her husband, the Prince of Wales, were pictured smiling and gazing at each other as they arrived together, walking side by side before the banquet at the castle. They were joined by other members of the royal family including the King and Queen, plus some 160 guests, in Windsor Castle's impressive St George's Hall. The King was seated between Mr Macron and French culture minister Rachida Dati, while Kate was on the other side of the French president. The Queen was on the other side of the table, between Brigitte Macron and French armed forces minister Sebastien Lecornu. On the other side of Mrs Macron was heir to the throne William. Staff said the table had taken six days to set up, with a highly polished table running the length of the room, decorated with hand-picked seasonal flowers and herbs from palace gardens. The menu, which was written in French as is the custom for state banquets, began with a selection of tender summer vegetables from the Gardens of Le Manoir with Sage, Raw Tomato and Extra Virgin Olive Oil Dressing. The next course was Supreme of Rhug Estate Chicken with Norfolk Asparagus and Tarragon Cream, followed by Iced Blackcurrant Parfait on a Blackcurrant-soaked Sponge with Elderflower Jelly for dessert. In a tradition started by the King, a cocktail was also created specially for the occasion, this time called L'entente. It combined British gin with lemon curd and French pastis, garnished with dried French cornflowers and English roses. Both the monarch and President delivered speeches at the event, where prime minister Sir Keir Starmer was also present. The King joked about the popular French cartoon character Asterix the Gaul's incomprehension about Britons' love of tea with a splash of milk, and how dinner guests had drunk “English sparkling wine made by a French Champagne house”. And he described the “perfect combinations” of French and British – Monet's paintings of London fog and Thierry Henry, a former French striker most famous for his time with Arsenal, scoring at Highbury. The French president even winked at the King when Charles mentioned the cultural ties between the UK and France and how a Frenchman, William the Conqueror, began building Windsor Castle more than 900 years ago and his son William has made Windsor his home. The King also spoke of more serious matters including the deepening co-operation between the UK and France that will protect against “profound challenges” such as terrorism, organised crime and “irregular migration” across the English Channel. In his speech Charles described the UK's closest continental neighbour as “one of our strongest allies” and said in the face of “complex threats” France and Britain “must help to lead the way”. Mr Macron also delivered a speech mostly in French but in English he spoke about France's loan of the Bayeux Tapestry which will go on display at the British Museum next year. Earlier in a speech to MPs and peers, Mr Macron promised to deliver on measures to cut the number of migrants crossing the English Channel, describing the issue as a “burden” to both countries. He told the gathering in Parliament: “France and the UK have a shared responsibility to address irregular migration with humanity, solidarity and fairness.” Decisions at Thursday's UK-France summit will “respond to our aims for co-operation and tangible results on these major issues”. Other notable invitees who turned out for the glittering banquet with Charles, were actress Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, former England goalkeeper Mary Earps, who now plays for Paris Saint-Germain, authors Joanne Harris and Sebastian Faulks and sculptor Sir Antony Gormley.

Emmanuel Macron was welcomed to Windsor Castle for a glittering banquet on Tuesday, as he was pictured clinking glasses and winking at royals. The French president sat amongst the likes of Mick Jagger and Elton John at the star-studded event on the first day of his state visit to the UK. The Princess of Wales was dressed in a dark red silk Givenchy gown as she sat next to Mr Macron for her first state banquet since her cancer diagnosis. The president was pictured winking and chatting with Kate as she sat next to Mr Macron wearing her favourite Lover's Knot tiara – a piece much loved by Diana, Princess of Wales. The princess and and her husband, the Prince of Wales, were pictured smiling and gazing at each other as they arrived together, walking side by side before the banquet at the castle. They were joined by other members of the royal family including the King and Queen, plus some 160 guests, in Windsor Castle's impressive St George's Hall. The King was seated between Mr Macron and French culture minister Rachida Dati, while Kate was on the other side of the French president. The Queen was on the other side of the table, between Brigitte Macron and French armed forces minister Sebastien Lecornu. On the other side of Mrs Macron was heir to the throne William. Staff said the table had taken six days to set up, with a highly polished table running the length of the room, decorated with hand-picked seasonal flowers and herbs from palace gardens. The menu, which was written in French as is the custom for state banquets, began with a selection of tender summer vegetables from the Gardens of Le Manoir with Sage, Raw Tomato and Extra Virgin Olive Oil Dressing. The next course was Supreme of Rhug Estate Chicken with Norfolk Asparagus and Tarragon Cream, followed by Iced Blackcurrant Parfait on a Blackcurrant-soaked Sponge with Elderflower Jelly for dessert. In a tradition started by the King, a cocktail was also created specially for the occasion, this time called L'entente. It combined British gin with lemon curd and French pastis, garnished with dried French cornflowers and English roses. Both the monarch and President delivered speeches at the event, where prime minister Sir Keir Starmer was also present. The King joked about the popular French cartoon character Asterix the Gaul's incomprehension about Britons' love of tea with a splash of milk, and how dinner guests had drunk “English sparkling wine made by a French Champagne house”. And he described the “perfect combinations” of French and British – Monet's paintings of London fog and Thierry Henry, a former French striker most famous for his time with Arsenal, scoring at Highbury. The French president even winked at the King when Charles mentioned the cultural ties between the UK and France and how a Frenchman, William the Conqueror, began building Windsor Castle more than 900 years ago and his son William has made Windsor his home. The King also spoke of more serious matters including the deepening co-operation between the UK and France that will protect against “profound challenges” such as terrorism, organised crime and “irregular migration” across the English Channel. In his speech Charles described the UK's closest continental neighbour as “one of our strongest allies” and said in the face of “complex threats” France and Britain “must help to lead the way”. Mr Macron also delivered a speech mostly in French but in English he spoke about France's loan of the Bayeux Tapestry which will go on display at the British Museum next year.

The banquet, hosted by King Charles and Queen Camilla on July 8, marked the French President's UK state visit. Prince William and Catherine, Princess of Wales, joined the royal hosts in welcoming President Macron and his wife Brigitte Macron at Windsor Castle. For the occasion, Kate wore a red gown by Sarah Burton for Givenchy. Burton, who famously designed Kate's wedding dress in 2011 while at Alexander McQueen, created this cape-style dress featuring an elegant round neckline, soft pleats, cape sleeves forming a flowing train, and a cinched waist. Kate completed her look with Queen Mary's Lover's Knot Tiara, a piece closely associated with both her and the late Princess Diana. According to People, this marked the first time in a year and a half that Kate has worn a tiara, having last worn it at the Diplomatic Reception in December 2023. She accessorised with diamond earrings, a delicate bracelet, a gemstone-embellished red clutch, and royal insignia pins displaying portraits of King Charles and Queen Camilla. Wearing her hair loose with a centre parting, Kate opted for a soft yet glamorous make-up look, including smokey eye shadow, defined lashes, flushed cheeks, and glossy pink lips.

Of those 15 tiara moments, 10 of them have been in the Queen Mary Lovers' Knot tiara—which was also the favorite tiara of Princess Diana. The Princess of Wales wore the Lovers' Knot tiara again on July 8 for a state banquet honoring France's President Emmanuel Macron and First Lady Brigitte Macron at Windsor Castle. Every tiara tells a story, and the deliberate choice of Kate Middleton wearing the Queen Mary Lovers' Knot tiara to last night's French state banquet is no exception. The Princess of Wales's favorite tiara—like her mother-in-law Princess Diana before her—is the Lovers' Knot, worn for 10 of the future queen's 15 tiara moments so far since marrying into the royal family in 2011. As Maxwell Stone of U.K. jeweler Steven Stone pointed out, the Lovers' Knot was the “very first Kate wore as Princess of Wales, making the moment deeply meaningful,” estimating that the sparkler is valued $135 million, “or potentially more, considering the legacies of the remarkable women who have worn it,” Stone said. “This piece is a true royal treasure,” he said of the tiara, adding that it is “renowned for its existing craftsmanship.” Kate Middleton and France's President Emmanuel Macron on July 8, 2025.

The tiara—which was reportedly so heavy it gave Diana headaches—was created in 1914 by Garrard for Queen Mary, who, following her death in 1953, passed the topper down to her granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth. After Diana married Prince Charles in 1981, the Queen gave the tiara to her, and she wore it many times throughout her royal life before returning it to the Queen following her divorce from Charles in 1996.

No one could ever accuse the Princess of Wales of not being an immensely thoughtful dresser—and July 8 was no exception.

mov_C6D870963BAA6AFFCE9D01BE8A18B662,"  Kate Middleton, Queen Camilla and Brigitte Macron made a unified sartorial statement with their attire at a state banquet on Tuesday held at Windsor Castle in Windsor, England. The Princess of Wales opted for a design by Givenchy, with Queen Camilla favoring one of her go-to designers, Fiona Clare, and Macron styled a custom royal blue cape gown by Louis Vuitton for the special occasion. Middleton's bespoke Givenchy gown was designed by Sarah Burton, who also designed the British royal family member's ornate lace wedding gown worn to her Westminster nuptials to Prince William in April 2011. The Princess of Wales' gown featured flowing chiffon fabric, with a sleeveless design, cinched waist for added silhouette definition and an elegant skirt. The gown also featured a cape element over the British royal's shoulders. Middleton carried the Lily of the Valley Embroidered Evening Clutch courtesy of Givenchy. As for finishing touches and further accessories, she wore a pair of burgundy velvet pumps by Jimmy Choo and the Queen Mary's Lover's Knot Tiara and the Greville Chandelier Earrings (both from Queen Elizabeth II's personal collection). The tiara is estimated to be worth roughly $1.3 million, according to the experts at Steven Stone in London. The tiara was designed by Queen Mary and then passed on to her granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth II. Middleton also wore Princess Diana's three-strand pearl bracelet. Queen Camilla wore a Fiona Clare ivory silk gown with embroidery on the front of the skirt and at the hemline and sleeves. She also carried the 'Bella' clutch in silver by Launer London. As for her jewels, Queen Camilla wore the late Queen Elizabeth II's Belgian Sapphire Tiara. She coordinated the tiara with Queen Elizabeth II's matching sapphire and diamond cluster line necklace as well as the sapphire earrings. The tiara is estimated to be worth $6.79 million, while the necklace is valued at $5.4 million, and the earrings are estimated to be worth roughly $407,000, according to the experts at Steven Stone in London. Brigitte Macron wore a deep blue silk crepe column gown by Louis Vuitton that featured a cape effect similar to that of Middleton's dress. The shoulders of the dress also included hand-embroidered black and silver jewel embellishments. Macron accessorized her attire with jewels courtesy of the French luxury fashion house as well. The red, white and blue colorscape of Middleton, Queen Camilla and Macron's attire seemingly referenced the colors of both the French flag and the flag of the U.K., also known as the Union Jack, creating an overall unified statement. French President Emmanuel Macron began his three-day state visit to the U.K. on Monday, marking the first visit by a European Union leader since the U.K.'s departure from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. The visit underscores efforts to renew ties between the two countries amid ongoing challenges such as migration across the English Channel and the war in Ukraine.

The Princess of Wales' gown featured flowing chiffon fabric, with a sleeveless design, cinched waist for added silhouette definition and an elegant skirt. The gown also featured a cape element over the British royal's shoulders. Middleton carried the Lily of the Valley Embroidered Evening Clutch courtesy of Givenchy. As for finishing touches and further accessories, she wore a pair of burgundy velvet pumps by Jimmy Choo and the Queen Mary's Lover's Knot Tiara and the Greville Chandelier Earrings (both from Queen Elizabeth II's personal collection). The tiara is estimated to be worth roughly $1.3 million, according to the experts at Steven Stone in London. The tiara was designed by Queen Mary and then passed on to her granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth II. Middleton also wore Princess Diana's three-strand pearl bracelet. Queen Camilla wore a Fiona Clare ivory silk gown with embroidery on the front of the skirt and at the hemline and sleeves. She also carried the 'Bella' clutch in silver by Launer London. As for her jewels, Queen Camilla wore the late Queen Elizabeth II's Belgian Sapphire Tiara. She coordinated the tiara with Queen Elizabeth II's matching sapphire and diamond cluster line necklace as well as the sapphire earrings. The tiara is estimated to be worth $6.79 million, while the necklace is valued at $5.4 million, and the earrings are estimated to be worth roughly $407,000, according to the experts at Steven Stone in London. Brigitte Macron wore a deep blue silk crepe column gown by Louis Vuitton that featured a cape effect similar to that of Middleton's dress. The shoulders of the dress also included hand-embroidered black and silver jewel embellishments. Macron accessorized her attire with jewels courtesy of the French luxury fashion house as well. The red, white and blue colorscape of Middleton, Queen Camilla and Macron's attire seemingly referenced the colors of both the French flag and the flag of the U.K., also known as the Union Jack, creating an overall unified statement. French President Emmanuel Macron began his three-day state visit to the U.K. on Monday, marking the first visit by a European Union leader since the U.K.'s departure from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. The visit underscores efforts to renew ties between the two countries amid ongoing challenges such as migration across the English Channel and the war in Ukraine.

On July 8, the Prince and Princess of Wales released a new photo of themselves dressed up for the state banquet at Windsor Castle, celebrating the state visit from France. ""Ready for what promises to be a wonderful State Banquet this evening in Windsor,"" their team wrote below the portrait shared to the couple's official social media accounts, adding emojis of the French flag and Great Britain's Union Jack. The Prince and Princess of Wales, both 43, were the picture of royal elegance in their white-tie attire and royal regalia, where William sported a black tailcoat and Kate wore a red gown with cape by Sarah Burton (her bridal gown designer) for Givenchy. Andrew Parsons / Kensington Palace Kate Middleton and Prince William in a portrait released on July 9, 2025. The image also revealed Princess Kate's tiara return for the first time since 2023, but that wasn't the only striking aspect. Switching things up, the picture of the Prince and Princess of Wales, credited to Andrew Parsons, was snapped outdoors. Royal portraits commemorating formal occasions like state visits are traditionally taken indoors in settings like state rooms, so it was different for William and Kate to capture such a snap outside. The shot showed them standing close together before a bucolic background below the summer sun. The Prince and Princess of Wales live close to Windsor Castle with their children, Prince George, 11, Princess Charlotte, 10, and Prince Louis, 7, meaning that the diplomatic dinner didn't take them far from home. The couple could have gotten ready at their Adelaide Cottage home and taken the picture there before heading out, or they may have snapped it elsewhere within the vast grounds of Windsor Castle.

Luke Newton may be famed for playing Colin Bridgerton (younger brother of Jonathan Bailey's Lord Anthony Bridgerton) on the Netflix period costume drama, but he's about to take on a whole new role – that of decidedly more modern, and openly gay, fashion designer Alexander McQueen. The 32-year-old English actor will portray the late London-born designer in the play ""House of McQueen"" by Darrah Cloud. The Off Broadway play is set to ""begin previews August 19 at The Mansion at Hudson Yards, with an official opening set for September 9,"" Deadline reported , with direction by Sam Helfrich. In addition to being a new play, ""House of McQueen"" ""will be the first production at the new Hudson Yards, Manhattan, venue,"" Deadline noted. The play's website describes the new stage work as being ""about the life and work of iconic fashion designer Alexander McQueen as told from his own revolutionary, daring and elegant perspective."" ""It is the story of a boy born in the east end of London, who literally wears his heart on his sleeve, never meant to rise beyond his working-class family,"" the description continues. ""From making doll clothes for his mother's friends to working in a tailor shop, he rises to the top of the fashion industry as chief designer for Givenchy and head of his own legendary fashion line, as his fashion shows become theatrical and artistic spectacles, attracting countless celebrities."" ""Seeking to find beauty in the most devastating aspects of life, McQueen envisions and creates clothes to empower women in response to what is happening in his life and the world around him,"" the site says. ""Fighting against the commercial interests of legendary houses like Givenchy and Gucci to remain provocative, he challenges norms and pushes boundaries as an artist."" ""In the end, the fight consumes him,"" the description summarizes. McQueen died in 2010 at the age of 40. McQueen became known for his low-rise jeans, called ""bumsters,"" as well as for his provocative designs and runway shows. He designed for recording stars like Lady Gaga – who wore his famed ""armadillo shoes"" – Björk, and David Bowie. McQueen's bold designs and dramatic fashion shows excited the fashion world but also led to allegations of misogyny , though the designer himself said he wished to ""empower women"" with his clothes. Deadline quoted Rick Lazes, who serves as an executive producer for the production, calling it an ""absolute pleasure to announce Luke's involvement with 'House of McQueen'"" and praising Newton as an ""incredibly impressive multi-hyphenate.""

Amazon's mini Christmas in July has consumers clicking on fashion — and there are more apparel brands in the promotional mix, including vintage designer style from ReBag as well as looks from Michael Kors, Naadam and more. Prime Day, which extended to four days this year and ends on Friday, has become a fixture on the retail calendar, prompting competing deals from other retailers. Altogether, retailers are expected to see $23.8 billion in sales, or the equivalent of two Black Fridays, according to Adobe. At Amazon, the event has had a strong fashion start. Numerator is tracking the e-commerce giant's Prime Day take, studying the activity of shoppers at 22,411 households and surveying 2,248 buyers during the sale's first two days. Thirty percent of buyers snatched up Prime Day apparel and footwear — tying for the top spot with cleaning products and other household essentials, according to the data and tech company. But in keeping with the general sense of caution in the market, consumers are being very calculated as they spend. Fifty-one percent of shoppers bought items that they'd been waiting to buy on sale and 37 percent of shoppers bought the same items they typically buy on Amazon. Numerator pegged the average order size on Prime Day at $57.12 and said 51 percent of households have made two or more orders, upping the average household spend to $126.26. Two-thirds of the Prime Day items have sold for under $20 while only 3 percent are over $100. Amazon has been steadily adding to its fashion mix and a company spokesperson pointed to the slate of fashions making their Prime Day debut. For the first time, the luxury resale player Rebag is offering price promotions on looks from Alexander McQueen, Chloé, Delvaux, Givenchy, Jacquemus, Valentino Garavani, Versace and Tom Ford on Amazon. And a host of brands have joined the rush this year and included select items in the event, such as Hervé Léger, Kate Barton, Calzedonia, Vans, Michael Kors and Naadam.","Numerator's research on the first two days of the event found that 30 percent of shoppers are clicking on apparel or footwear, tying with household essentials.

Vanessa Kirby stepped into shine and structure for Thursday's London premiere of “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” wearing Aquazzura's Minute Sandal 105 in metallic silver — the latest entry in her sculptural maternity footwear streak.QUES The Italian-made stilettos featured mirrored leather uppers, two slim straps and a high, tapered heel. A back zip created a clean finish at the ankle, and the brand's signature gold plaque was visible on the sole. The 105mm silhouette added lift without disrupting the overall proportion. Related Stories Kirby paired the sandals with a beaded turquoise dress from Loewe's spring 2025 collection. The strapless midi-length look, styled by Andrew Mukamal, was constructed entirely of layered bead strands that created fringe-like movement across the body. The runway version featured a shorter hemline and metallic underlayer, but Kirby's custom iteration removed any lining to emphasize the vertical drape. Combined with the clean stiletto, the full look felt visually elongated. This marked Kirby's latest footwear-forward look on the “Fantastic Four: First Steps” press tour. Earlier this week in Paris, she wore metallic wraparound stilettos with a lilac Givenchy halter dress. In Mexico, she styled two different Manolo Blahnik silhouettes — including the black snakeskin Paloma heel — with cutout knits and a teal Schiaparelli gown. And at the Alabama trailer launch in February, she wore pointed PVC stilettos with vintage Versace. Across each appearance, Kirby has relied on heels with clean lines and exaggerated finishes — think eye-catching metallics, sheer panels and snakeskin — to ground dresses that range from architectural to body-conscious. “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” marks the Marvel franchise's official reboot under Disney, introducing a new cast led by Kirby, Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. Directed by Matt Shakman, the film serves as both an origin story and launchpad for the characters' integration into the broader MCU, ahead of their expected crossover appearances in “Avengers: Secret Wars.” The film opens in U.S. theaters on July 25.

主催するパリ・オートクチュール組合の公式カレンダー上では、今季は昨シーズンの28から1つ減の27ブランドが参加。 「ディオール（DIOR）」や「ヴァレンティノ（VALENTINO）」、ジャン・ポール・ゴルチエのクチュールライン、「ゴルチエ パリ（GAULTIER PARIS）」等がコレクションを発表せず、久々に「アデリーヌ アンドレ（Adeline André）」等が参加するなどの増減が見られた。 その「ゴルチエ パリ」は、毎シーズン、注目度の高いデザイナーを迎えてコレクションを発表していたが、前回のルドヴィック・サン・セルナンによるコレクションをもってゲスト・デザイナー制は終了。 今年4月に、デュラン・ランティックがパーマネントなアーティスティック・ディレクターに就任。 9月のレディースコレクションに向けて始動し、来年の1月にはオートクチュール・コレクションの発表も予定されているという。 今季のトピックは、何よりも「メゾン マルジェラ（Maison Margiela）」と「バレンシアガ（BALENCIAGA）」だった。 ジョン・ガリアーノが去り、クリエイティブ・ディレクターにマルタン・マルジェラと同郷のベルギー人、グレン・マーティンスが着任した「メゾン マルジェラ」。 マーティンスが「Y/プロジェクト（Y/PROJECT）」で見せていたシュールレアリスティックな手法が、「メゾン マルジェラ」でどのような化学反応を引き起こすのか、大いに注目を集めた。 一方の、デムナによる最終コレクションとなった「バレンシアガ」は、オートクチュール会期中に終了したデムナの懐古作品展「Balenciaga by Demna」と共にメモリアルなものとなった。 来季は、ピエールパオロ・ピッチョーリによる「バレンシアガ」、ジョナサン・アンダーソンによる「ディオール」、マチュー・ブラジによる「シャネル（CHANEL）」、サラ・バートンによる　「ジバンシィ（GIVENCHY）」、そしてデュラン・ランティックによる「ゴルチエ パリ」と、全て出揃うかは現時点で不明ではあるものの、期待値の高いシーズンとなりそうである。 シャネル（CHANEL） Courtesy of CHANEL 今季もクリエイション・スタジオによるコレクションを、グラン・パレにて披露した「シャネル」。 ガブリエル・シャネルが度々イメージソースにして来たイギリスの田園風景や、スコットランドの荒野にインスパイアされた。 アイボリーやブラウン、グリーン、ブラックなどナチュラルなカラーパレットで構成。 ガブリエル・シャネルが好み、ファインジュエリーでも度々登場する麦穂のモチーフが随所にあしらわれ、自然の要素を滲ませた。 フランスでは、麦穂は豊穣の象徴としてのラッキーチャーム。 刺繍を施したツイードのドレスでスタートしたが、シンプルでマニッシュな印象。 ガブリエル・シャネルがメンズのスーツからインスパイアされて、「シャネルスーツ」を編み出したことを想起させた。 羽を飾ったケープにもツイードのメンズライクなワンピースを合わせ、ニーハイブーツをコーディネートしてモダンで若々しいスタイリングに。 チェーンを飾った黒のツイードのセットアップは、甲冑のような力強さを見せる。 麦穂のテクスチャーを思わせるツイードのブルゾンには、シルクサテンのドレープスカートを合わせて、スポーティでマスキュリンなアイテムに敢えてフェミニンなアイテムを組み合わせてコントラストを見せる。 フリンジをあしらったセットアップやワンピースも、フォルムはシンプルでマニッシュな印象。 シルクサテンのロングドレスにも、羽を刺繍してファーのように仕立てたメンズコートをコーディネートして、マスキュリン・フェミニンに。 ラグランスリーブのカーディガン風のツイードジャケットには、プリーツシフォンのスカートを合わせ、適度なカジュアルさを演出。 フェミニンなドレス一辺倒にするのではなく、敢えてマスキュリン・スポーティに仕上げて、ウルトラモダンなクチュールの世界観を描いて見せていた。 メゾン マルジェラ（Maison Margiela） Courtesy of Maison Margiela 文化複合施設である104（サン・キャートル）を会場に、オートクチュールと同等に扱われるアーティザナルコレクションのショーを開催した、新任のグレン・マーティンスによる「メゾン マルジェラ」。 104は、2008年9月にマルタン・マルジェラ本人による最終コレクションが発表された場所で、今季は全てのモデルにマスクが合わせられたことからも、オリジナルへのオマージュ・リスペクトを印象付けた。 今季は、フランドル地方の中世建築からインスパイア。 ゴシック建築に見られる彫像や教会に飾られる聖人たちの彫像、北ヨーロッパのルネッサンス期の邸宅のインテリア、16世紀のフランドル地方のエンボスによるレザーの壁紙、象徴主義の画家ギュスターヴ・モローの作品などにイメージを求め、ベルギー出身のデザイナーらしいダークかつ耽美な世界観を披露している。 透明のプラスチックドレスでスタート。 インナーに同素材のコルセットを合わせ、脚元にはアクリルウェッジソールの「タビ」サンダル。 ギュスターヴ・モローの筆致を思わせるハンドペイントを施したストレッチサテンのセットアップにも、プラスチックのプラストロンをコーディネート。 16世紀のフランドル地方のレザー製壁紙のモチーフをプリントした、金属糸を織り込んだファブリックによるドレスは、ハートの形にシェイプされ、ドラマティックな一点となった。 アップサイクルされたバイカージャケットにも、16世紀のフランドル地方のレザー製型紙のパターンをコピーした紙を貼り付け、敢えて朽ち果てて行く様を表現。 17世紀のオランダの静物画に登場する羽のイメージをプリントしたファブリックをカットアップして繋いだスカートや、アップサイクルされたヴィンテージのネックレスを繋いだニットドレス、17世紀のオランダの静物画に描かれた花をプリントして花をカットして縫い付けたプラスチックのコート。 そのどれもがこのブランドらしいシュールレアリスティックな手法に則っている。 アップサイクルされた素材をあしらうというコンセプトを守りつつ、より手の込んだ徹底した作品作りの姿勢を見せていた。 ジョルジオ アルマーニ プリヴェ（GIORGIO ARMANI PRIVÉ） Courtesy of Giorgio Armani／Photo by Marie-Laure Dutel Israël 「ジョルジオ アルマーニ プリヴェ」は、今年に入ってフランソワ1世通りにオープンさせたパラッツォ・アルマーニにてオートクチュール・コレクションを発表。 ブラックを主軸に据えて、黒というベーシックカラーが持つ究極のエレガンスを表現した。 夜をイメージさせるブルーを差し色にしたテイラードでスタート。 ブロケードや膨れ織り、デボレなど、凹凸感ある素材使いがこのブランドらしい。 プリント地に刺繍を施して絵画的に仕上げたジャケットや、花びらを散らしたような総刺繍のジャケット、抽象画のような刺繍のトップスとテクノ素材のスカートのセットアップなど、一つの時代やスタイルにこだわらない、バリエーション豊かな作品が並ぶ。...,SPR_COMBO[ja]写真左から「シャネル」「バレンシアガ」「メゾン マルジェラ」 「ジョルジオ アルマーニ プリヴェ」 メンズコレクション終了後、1週間を空けてスタートしたオートクチュール・コレクション。 2025年7月7日から10日までの4日間、パリ市内の各所でショーが開催された。 主催するパリ・オートクチュール組合の公式カレンダー上では、今季は昨シーズンの28から1つ減の27ブランドが参加。 「ディオール（DIOR）」や「ヴァレンティノ（VALENTINO）」、ジャン・ポール・ゴルチエのクチュールライン、「ゴルチエ パリ（GAULTIER PARIS）」等がコレクションを発表せず、久々に「アデリーヌ アンドレ（Adeline André）」等が参加するなどの増減が見られた。 その「ゴルチエ パリ」は、毎シーズン、注目度の高いデザイナーを迎えてコレクションを発表していたが、前回のルドヴィック・サン・セルナンによるコレクションをもってゲスト・デザイナー制は終了。 今年4月に、デュラン・ランティックがパーマネントなアーティスティック・ディレクターに就任。 9月のレディースコレクションに向けて始動し、来年の1月にはオートクチュール・コレクションの発表も予定されているという。 今季のトピックは、何よりも「メゾン マルジェラ（Maison Margiela）」と「バレンシアガ（BALENCIAGA）」だった。 ジョン・ガリアーノが去り、クリエイティブ・ディレクターにマルタン・マルジェラと同郷のベルギー人、グレン・マーティンスが着任した「メゾン マルジェラ」。 マーティンスが「Y/プロジェクト（Y/PROJECT）」で見せていたシュールレアリスティックな手法が、「メゾン

今年6月，纽约长岛一座私人庄园里，举行了一场低调奢华的婚礼，整个美国上流社会几乎全部聚集在这里。 宾客名单包括奥巴马夫妇、克林顿夫妇、希拉里、副总统哈尔斯以及传媒业巨头，再加华尔街精英。 相信你也看出来了，婚礼的主人既富又贵。 新郎是39岁的亚历山大.索罗斯。 没错，就是那个金融大鳄，富可敌国，随便动动手指全球经济就要抖三抖的索罗斯。 而新娘，不仅比新郎大9岁，离异带娃，儿子14岁，还曾深陷性丑闻，因为私生活导致事业全线崩溃。 她曾经差点就从地铁站台跳下去，一了百了。 如今她身穿一条Givenchy高定白裙嫁人，下摆的橄榄枝刺绣是唯一的点缀，除了耳环没有任何首饰，全凭自身优雅气质撑场。 她那身家250亿美金的老公，全程笑得见牙不见眼，像是捡到了绝世珍宝。 她整个婚礼的造型，由全美名利场公认品味最好的女魔头安娜包办。 安娜可不是砸钱就能请到的造型师。 你看她在桑切斯身边这坐立难安的样子。 她肯出手为新娘做造型，这几乎代表着全美时尚圈的高度认可。 婚礼当天飘着毛毛细雨，所有迎宾打起白伞，按我们中国人的审美，这场面肃穆到有点让人分不清是喜是丧。 礼成时，新娘14岁的儿子上前拥抱母亲，两人相拥而泣。 “爱的海啸席卷了我们，我沉浸在喜悦之中，充满幸福和感激。” 这行泪，一半是因为太过幸福，另一半是因为洗尽屈辱。 因为过去的14年，对于新娘来说是从云端跌落谷底，从人人称羡的名流一夜坠落为“全美笑柄”的过程。 新娘名叫胡玛Huma Abedin，希拉里最信任的心腹，中东问题的操盘手。 单亲妈妈拿下年下多金、高知巨富小奶狗，政商联姻、千亿豪门！ 咱就是说，网剧都不敢这么编！ 现实就这么摆在了你面前。 胡玛这是拿的什么剧本？ 她如何做到的？ 一 
胡玛的前半生，是中产家庭培养女儿的范本。 她1976年7月28日生于美国密歇根州，父母是印度裔穆斯林学者。 胡玛幼年随父母移居沙特阿拉伯，在吉达生活至18岁。 胡玛的父亲赛义德·阿贝丁是伊斯兰社会学专家，母亲萨利玛·阿贝丁则创办了《阿拉伯穆斯林研究杂志》。 这是一个标准的书香门第。 胡玛在1996年进入乔治·华盛顿大学，主修新闻与国际关系。 同年暑期，她进入白宫实习，成为第一夫人希拉里·克林顿的助手。 这是多么漂亮的履历。 胡玛的身上，充满着希拉里的“影子” 。 初期，她负责希拉里日程安排与信函处理，日均工作18小时。 四年后，胡玛随希拉里进入参议院，担任副幕僚长。 2008年，工作12年的胡玛任希拉里竞选团队旅行总监，协调全球行程。 同事称她“能在5分钟内搞定别人5天办不成的事”。 2009年，胡玛出任副幕僚长，经手所有机密文件。 《纽约时报》称她为“希拉里的第二个大脑”。 希拉里更是把胡玛当做自己的女儿对待。 胡玛的身上有野心有毅力，有强大的判断能力也有冷静的头脑。 《VOGUE》的专访这样形容她： 
    “胡玛·阿贝丁只睡了三个小时，喝了四杯咖啡，但她身穿的黑色普拉达套装毫无褶皱，皮肤完美无瑕。” 这个事业上如此成功的女人，同时还拥有无懈可击的外型。 全白宫最会穿的女人 
How？ 为什么小编我只是写1000字就困得想随地躺倒？ 大家都是人类，怎么基础设施区别这么大！ 作为女性，胡玛几乎是完美的。 她有高学历带来的高认知水准，同时手握美国社会最上层资源，她的美貌不肤浅，她的优秀有目共睹。 她值得最上等的婚姻，就是那种传说中珠联璧合的神仙眷侣。 一开始，胡玛也是这么以为的。...",SPR_COMBO[zh] 今年6月，纽约长岛一座私人庄园里，举行了一场低调奢华的婚礼，整个美国上流社会几乎全部聚集在这里。 宾客名单包括奥巴马夫妇、克林顿夫妇、希拉里、副总统哈尔斯以及传媒业巨头，再加华尔街精英。 相信你也看出来了，婚礼的主人既富又贵。 新郎是39岁的亚历山大.索罗斯。 没错，就是那个金融大鳄，富可敌国，随便动动手指全球经济就要抖三抖的索罗斯。 而新娘，不仅比新郎大9岁，离异带娃，儿子14岁，还曾深陷性丑闻，因为私生活导致事业全线崩溃。 她曾经差点就从地铁站台跳下去，一了百了。 如今她身穿一条Givenchy高定白裙嫁人，下摆的橄榄枝刺绣是唯一的点缀，除了耳环没有任何首饰，全凭自身优雅气质撑场。 她那身家250亿美金的老公，全程笑得见牙不见眼，像是捡到了绝世珍宝。 她整个婚礼的造型，由全美名利场公认品味最好的女魔头安娜包办。 安娜可不是砸钱就能请到的造型师。 你看她在桑切斯身边这坐立难安的样子。 她肯出手为新娘做造型，这几乎代表着全美时尚圈的高度认可。 婚礼当天飘着毛毛细雨，所有迎宾打起白伞，按我们中国人的审美，这场面肃穆到有点让人分不清是喜是丧。 礼成时，新娘14岁的儿子上前拥抱母亲，两人相拥而泣。 “爱的海啸席卷了我们，我沉浸在喜悦之中，充满幸福和感激。” 这行泪，一半是因为太过幸福，另一半是因为洗尽屈辱。 因为过去的14年，对于新娘来说是从云端跌落谷底，从人人称羡的名流一夜坠落为“全美笑柄”的过程。 新娘名叫胡玛Huma Abedin，希拉里最信任的心腹，中东问题的操盘手。 单亲妈妈拿下年下多金、高知巨富小奶狗，政商联姻、千亿豪门！ 咱就是说，网剧都不敢这么编！ 现实就这么摆在了你面前。 胡玛这是拿的什么剧本？ 她如何做到的？ 一 胡玛的前半生，是中产家庭培养女儿的范本。 她1976年7月28日生于美国密歇根州，父母是印度裔穆斯林学者。 胡玛幼年随父母移居沙特阿拉伯，在吉达生活至18岁。 胡玛的父亲赛义德·阿贝丁是伊斯兰社会学专家，母亲萨利玛·阿贝丁则创办了《阿拉伯穆斯林研究杂志》。 这是一个标准的书香门第。 胡玛在1996年进入乔治·华盛顿大学，主修新闻与国际关系。 同年暑期，她进入白宫实习，成为第一夫人希拉里·克林顿的助手。 这是多么漂亮的履历。 胡玛的身上，充满着希拉里的“影子” 。 初期，她负责希拉里日程安排与信函处理，日均工作18小时。 四年后，胡玛随希拉里进入参议院，担任副幕僚长。 2008年，工作12年的胡玛任希拉里竞选团队旅行总监，协调全球行程。 同事称她“能在5分钟内搞定别人5天办不成的事”。 2009年，胡玛出任副幕僚长，经手所有机密文件。 《纽约时报》称她为“希拉里的第二个大脑”。 希拉里更是把胡玛当做自己的女儿对待。 胡玛的身上有野心有毅力，有强大的判断能力也有冷静的头脑。 《VOGUE》的专访这样形容她： “胡玛·阿贝丁只睡了三个小时，喝了四杯咖啡，但她身穿的黑色普拉达套装毫无褶皱，皮肤完美无瑕。” 这个事业上如此成功的女人，同时还拥有无懈可击的外型。 全白宫最会穿的女人 How？ 为什么小编我只是写1000字就困得想随地躺倒？ 大家都是人类，怎么基础设施区别这么大！ 作为女性，胡玛几乎是完美的。 她有高学历带来的高认知水准，同时手握美国社会最上层资源，她的美貌不肤浅，她的优秀有目共睹。 她值得最上等的婚姻，就是那种传说中珠联璧合的神仙眷侣。 一开始，胡玛也是这么以为的。...,2025-07-12 16:33:08,zh,WEB,,,,,False,1,False,False,,,"The text is a long narrative in Chinese about a wedding involving Huma Abedin, mentioning a Givenchy wedding dress.
