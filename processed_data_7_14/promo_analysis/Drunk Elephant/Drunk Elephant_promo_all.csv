[Learn more] Amazon's big Prime Day sale doesn't start until tomorrow (Tuesday) but they've launched some great deals already. There's 63% off Olay's luxurious whipped moisturiser that leaves skin 'feeling fresh' and has a 'gorgeous scent'. The Olay Regenerist Whip Day Face Cream is usually £38 but it's down to just £14. The whipped moisturiser transforms from cream to liquid on contact and is quickly absorbed, giving a smooth matte finish without clogging pores. The lightweight, non-greasy cream acts as a 2-in-1 primer and moisturiser, ready for make-up. Enriched with vitamin B3, it helps promote skin cell renewal and reduce fine lines and wrinkles – and also provides SPF30 protection. MORE AMAZON DEALS One reviewer wrote: “I have always used various Olay products all my adult life and I'm in my 60s. This particular one is very creamy but sinks into the skin quickly and feels light. It has a touch of luxury when using it and lasts well.” Whipped face products have become a popular beauty trend in recent years. Drunk Elephant's Lala Retro Whipped Cream delivers intense hydration and costs £58, while Bondi Sands' Daydream Whipped Moisturiser is on offer at LookFantastic for £7.49. However, the Regenerist Whip Day Face Cream gets an overall rating of 4.5 stars from more than 2,800 Amazon customers. One said: ""I usually always use Olay and thought I would try this whip one, well I'm glad I did - its got the most gorgeous scent to it and I love it, also makes my skin look and feel better."" Another said: ""Absolutely love this. It's really lightweight but soaks in to the skin well without feeling oily and leaves my skin feeling fresh but not shiny. I have also noticed a better look to the laughter lines around my eyes!"" A third added: ""This whip version with a high SPF is perfect for day wear. I have been tempted to pay a fortune for other hyped skin care, believing they would be better. Not a chance, I stick with Regenerist and my skin looks lovely."" Some felt it was a little too expensive when not on offer, saying: ""Bit pricey considering it is whip, meaning there is slightly less actual product than original."" But that's why the current 63% discount is a great chance to try it out. Amazon will be announcing even more discounts come Tuesday, July 8 when Prime Day kicks off – and, despite the name, the event runs until July 11. ""With four full days to shop, Prime members have more time than ever to explore and save,"" Amazon said.

Ma ti sei mai chiesto se tutti questi prodotti che promettono risultati straordinari riescano davvero a mantenere le loro promesse? In questo articolo, andremo a scoprire alcune delle novità più interessanti nel mercato della bellezza, analizzando le loro caratteristiche, gli ingredienti e il potenziale impatto sulla tua routine di bellezza quotidiana. Dai sieri innovativi ai primer multifunzionali, vedremo come questi prodotti si distinguono nella folla e quali metriche possono guidare le nostre scelte. Le ultime innovazioni nei sieri e nei primer I dati ci raccontano una storia interessante riguardo ai sieri e ai primer che stanno conquistando il mercato. Prendiamo ad esempio il nuovo siero di Drunk Elephant, un prodotto che promette di regalare una pelle radiosa e ben idratata. Questo siero ha dimostrato, in uno studio clinico, un incremento immediato dell'idratazione della pelle del 115%: un risultato che ha catturato l'attenzione degli esperti del settore. La leggerezza della formulazione e la sua capacità di migliorare l'elasticità e la fermezza della pelle lo rendono un candidato ideale per chi cerca risultati tangibili. Sei curioso di sapere se può fare la differenza nella tua routine? Non possiamo dimenticare il primer di Anastasia Beverly Hills, arricchito con SPF, che rappresenta un altro esempio di come i marchi stiano rispondendo alle esigenze dei consumatori. Con l'84% di ingredienti dedicati alla cura della pelle, questo prodotto non solo protegge dai raggi UV, ma offre anche un'idratazione duratura. Ingredienti come niacinamide e glicerina contribuiscono a ottenere una pelle liscia e levigata; due fattori cruciali per un primer di successo. Hai mai pensato a quanto sia importante la protezione solare nella tua routine di bellezza? Case study: l'approccio di Deborah Pagani Nella mia esperienza in Google, ho imparato che il successo di un prodotto dipende non solo dalla sua qualità, ma anche dalla narrazione che lo circonda. Un ottimo esempio è Deborah Pagani, ex colorista di celebrità e ora fondatrice di un marchio di lusso. Ha lanciato un siero per capelli che combina ingredienti di alta qualità come acido ialuronico e squalano. Questo prodotto non solo idrata e ripara, ma offre anche un profumo distintivo, frutto della collaborazione con un noto profumiere. Pagani ha dichiarato di voler rompere gli standard di settore, puntando su ingredienti puliti e risultati efficaci. Non è interessante vedere come una strategia di marketing ben definita possa supportare un prodotto di bellezza? Analizzando le metriche di performance, è evidente che la popolarità del siero di Pagani è in crescita, grazie anche alla sua capacità di creare un'esperienza di lusso per il consumatore. I feedback sono stati positivi, evidenziando l'efficacia e la qualità degli ingredienti. E tu, cosa cerchi in un prodotto per capelli? Strategie di implementazione e KPI da monitorare Se desideri implementare strategie simili nel marketing dei prodotti di bellezza, è fondamentale concentrarsi su alcuni KPI chiave. Tra questi, il tasso di conversione (CTR), il ritorno sulla spesa pubblicitaria (ROAS) e il modello di attribuzione sono metriche essenziali che possono fornire informazioni dettagliate sulla performance delle campagne. Monitorare questi KPI permette di ottimizzare le strategie di marketing e di adattarsi rapidamente alle esigenze del mercato. Ti sei mai chiesto quanto un buon monitoraggio possa influenzare il successo delle tue campagne? Inoltre, avere una visione chiara del customer journey è cruciale: comprendere le fasi che un consumatore attraversa, dalla consapevolezza all'acquisto, consente di personalizzare le offerte e migliorare l'esperienza del cliente. Utilizzare strumenti di analisi come Google Analytics può aiutare a raccogliere dati preziosi per prendere decisioni informate e guidare le strategie di marketing. Sei pronto a scoprire come ottimizzare il tuo approccio al mercato della bellezza? In conclusione, il settore della bellezza è in continua trasformazione e la chiave del successo risiede nella combinazione di innovazione, analisi dati e comprensione profonda delle esigenze dei consumatori.

Learn more Creating the perfect summer skin is all about two things; hydration and glow. We all want a base that feels lightweight, comfortable and easy to wear whilst still giving us some added radiance, which is why we're loving this clever skincare hack that Zara McDermott shared on her Instagram recently. Zara used only two products to create the look; the L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion and the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Filler Replumping Water Cream, and although Zara herself is an ambassador for the brand, she revealed she'd spotted the hack going viral elsewhere and had to try it out for herself. If you're keen to copy her look, now is the ideal time as both products have landed in the Amazon Prime Day sale, with the Glotion slashed from £12.79 to £8.99, whilst the Replumping Water Cream has a huge 54% saving, taking it from £29.99 to £13.79. READ MORE: Millie Mackintosh shares her makeup hack to get a '10 second facelift' READ MORE: Frankie Bridge's go-to IPL hair removal device now has £500 off in flash sale Whilst it's obviously nothing groundbreaking to be wearing a moisturiser and a glow enhancer, the two can often be tricky to pair together, with some glow serums not sitting well over the top of your moisturiser. However Zara's hack involves blending the two hydrating products together, which avoids separation and patchiness that can happen when you try to layer them. That's why the L'Oréal Paris Replumping Water Cream is the perfect pick for this technique, as it has a non-greasy finish, not to mention a handy press down top which lets you mix the two together on top of the moisturiser, creating minimal waste. Zara showed how quick and easy it was to do, by pumping some moisturiser into the top of the pot before adding a healthy squeeze of the L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion and mixing it together with her finger. She then applied it directly onto her face using just her fingers to blend it all together, before sharing her amazement at the results. Zara's face had an instantly smoother look and a more radiant glow, whilst still looking like she was wearing nothing at all, giving her skin the perfect natural glow for summer.

tw_sl_3678e3a148265e95655d264a8a5819d2,"  Zara McDermott has shared a clever hack for getting naturally radiant, glowing skin this summer, with two L'Oréal products that are now discounted in the Amazon Prime Day sale Bookmark Share Faith RichardsonSenior Digital Style and Shopping Writer Bookmark Zara McDermott shared her skincare hack for glowy skin (Image: Instagram/zara_mcdermott) Achieving the perfect summer skin is all about two key elements; hydration and glow. We're all after a base that feels light, comfy and easy to wear while still giving us that added radiance, which is why we're totally smitten with this savvy skincare trick that Zara McDermott revealed on her Instagram recently. Zara used just two products to create the look; the L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion and the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Filler Replumping Water Cream. Even though Zara herself is an ambassador for the brand, she confessed she'd seen the hack going viral elsewhere and simply had to give it a whirl herself. If you're eager to replicate her look, now's the perfect time as both products are currently in the Amazon Prime Day sale, with the Glotion reduced from £12.79 to £8.99, whilst the Replumping Water Cream has a whopping 54% off, taking it from £29.99 to £13.79. READ MORE: Millie Mackintosh's '10 second facelift' hack is done using just two makeup products READ MORE: Frankie Bridge's favourite IPL hair removal device that's 'so easy to use' is now £500 off While it's not exactly earth-shattering news to be wearing a moisturiser and a glow booster, the two can often be tricky to pair together, with some glow serums not sitting well over your moisturiser. However, Zara's trick involves mixing the two hydrating products together, which avoids any separation and patchiness that can occur when you try to layer them. Zara showed how impressive the results of the skincare hack are (Image: Zara McDermott/Instagram) That's why the L'Oréal Paris Replumping Water Cream is an ideal choice for this method, thanks to its non-greasy finish and a convenient press-down top that allows you to blend the two products directly on the moisturiser, minimising waste. Zara demonstrated how simple and quick it was by dispensing some moisturiser into the pot's top, followed by a generous dollop of the L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion, and mixing them together with her finger. She then applied the mixture directly onto her face using only her fingers to blend it in, before expressing her astonishment at the outcome. Zara's complexion appeared instantly smoother and more luminous, yet still looked as if she wasn't wearing any makeup at all, providing her skin with the perfect natural glow for summer.

tw_sl_76a9c5c01e73aedf75f5c5a5ad4c8220,"  Amazon Prime Day is back. Shoppers can get their hands on bargains from bestselling brands - and this year it runs for four days for the first time. The sale started at midnight on Tuesday, July 8 - but despite its name, shoppers don't just have one day to get their hands on the bargains. It will run all the way until midnight on Friday, July 11, with four whole days to shop the sale. You will need to have an Amazon Prime subscription in order to access the vast majority of the exclusive Prime Day deals. But while a membership usually costs £8.99 per month, Amazon is currently offering shoppers the opportunity to try a 30-day free trial to unlock Prime Day without having to pay a penny. Shoppers who have flocked to previous Prime Day sales will know that deals span a huge range of categories, from high-end tech gadgets to everyday household essentials. Amazon's own devices are virtually guaranteed to feature, with price drops on the likes of Fire TVs and TV Sticks, Echo smart speakers, Kindle and Ring devices. Other big-name brands often pop up in Prime Day events, offering some major savings for shoppers. But whether you're after the latest Ninja air fryer, a new Dyson or Shark vacuum cleaner, or a new Apple or Samsung phone, it's always worth shopping around to check offers from other websites, including the brand's own, to ensure you are snagging the best deal. In addition, price tracking websites should be every shopper's best friend when browsing the Prime Day sale this year. Sites such as camelcamelcamel can show the full price history of any Amazon product you have your eye on to see whether its sale price is all it's cracked up to be, while the likes of PriceRunner and PriceSpy can compare it against offers from other retailers.

Key Events 13:00Catherine Addison-Swan Olay moisturiser 'better than high end brands' now 63% off Another stand-out beauty deal for today is on Olay's Regenerist Whip Moisturiser. Originally retailing at £38, this hydrating face cream is now just £14 - a substantial 63% reduction. Whipped facial products have become a beauty trend in recent years, with offerings like Drunk Elephant's Lala Retro Whipped Cream and Bondi Sands' Daydream Whipped Moisturiser making waves. Olay's anti-wrinkle cream contains 99% pure Niacinamide, which aids skin cell renewal, and anti-ageing peptides proven to diminish fine lines and wrinkles. Additionally, the cream boasts SPF 30, making it the perfect base for summer. Read more about this deal HERE. 12:42Lucy Addicott DAY TWO PRICE DROP: Amazon further reduce £80 Remington straighteners now under £20 Day two of Amazon Prime Day sees a bestselling Remington hair tool now even cheaper. Previously on sale for £23, beauty fans can currently get them for £19.66 in a 75% off deal. Typically £79.99 some shoppers have said they are 'better than my ghds', but they 'do take a little longer to get temperature' when compared with the £139 ghd alternative. More than 32,000 Amazon customers have left reviews for them, giving them an overall rating of 4.6 out of five stars. The Remington straighteners utilise unique anti-static, tourmaline ceramic plates to glide smoothly through hair, providing additional shine and protection compared to standard ceramic coating, as they are infused with Moroccan Argan Oil and Vitamin E. They also come equipped with floating plates for uniform pressure and heat distribution, capable of straightening hair in a single stroke and automatically switching off after 60 minutes. 12:20Catherine Addison-Swan Echo Pop speakers now £5.55 if shoppers do one thing Alexa smart home devices have become a staple in millions of homes since the Echo's debut in time for Black Friday 2014, with Amazon claiming the tech has picked up 'tens of thousands' of skills over the years, from playing music, audiobooks and podcasts to controlling compatible smart home devices like plugs or lights, all of which can be done hands free with Alexa voice control. Alexa can set timers, check the weather, place Amazon orders, answer questions and more. As one of the smallest and most versatile of Amazon's smart speaker range, the Echo Pop normally costs £44.99 but has been reduced to £20.99 for the Prime Day. While the 53% discount is already hefty, savvy shoppers have found a way to get one for less than £6 - working out an 88% saving on the usual price. Bargain hunters who sign up with money saving website TopCashback can get a free £15 new member sign up bonus payable on their first purchase through a qualifying website, alongside a percentage back of every qualifying spend.

E.l.f.'s Hydrating Core Lip Shine in the ""Ecstatic"" shade, which reviewers say captures the some magic as ""Black Honey,"" the $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique that's blowing up on TikTok at a fraction of the price. It doesn't shift colors as magically as the other version, but it's a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lip. I personally will live, breathe, and die by the magic of $25 ""universal"" Black Honey version — it lasts FOREVER and also functions as the perfect blush — but it sells out so often that I am also deeply relieved to know it has a cheap alternative in case of lip emergency! Promising review: ""I absolutely love this product. The dark color is perfectly sheer. It also adds the most beautiful color to your lips. I am a Clinique Black Honey lip fan, and this gives me the same look for a fraction of the cost. I love it and have multiple that I keep in various spots. Not sticky either, which is my biggest gripe about lip glosses. My hair doesn't get stuck in this like some glosses, but I get the shine."" —Hamps5 Get it from Amazon for $6 (also available in four other shades). 2. A set of square stemmed wineglasses inspired by the iconic Crate & Barrel version, except these are durable as heck (good for particularly rowdy wine-and-cheese nights). Reviewers especially love these chic, understated glasses because they work well for red and white wines. Promising review: ""We've had four of these glasses for over six months now and finally just added four more to our collection. These glasses are SO CHIC and are very similar to ones sold at Crate & Barrel but are MUCH more durable. Unlike the C&B glasses, you can cheers without feeling like the glasses will break. In fact, they've tipped over in the sink a few times and are still intact. They dry beautifully, sparkle after the dishwasher and we get so many compliments on them. I love them!"" —Katie B Get a set of two from Amazon for $27.99. 3. L'Oréal Paris Makeup True Match Lumi Glotion designed to enhance your skin's natural ✨ glow✨ just like the pricy Drunk Elephant drops — perfect for anyone who wants a lightweight alternative to foundation or just a lil' extra low-effort, ethereal shimmer in their lives. Promising review: ""Love love love this stuff. This is such a stellar product that is so versatile. Can be worn alone to put some glowy life to skin. Add to foundation or layer it. Beautiful. Use it as a base where you put highlighter on top. Mix some with moisturizer. This, in my opinion, is better than so many high-luxury brands that make similar products.
