1lq2g1h,"  I need help! I'm looking for a new signature scent (or two or three) but with the economy being what it is, I simply can't justify high prices for colognes anymore. (Goodbye Tom Ford and MFK!) Also, I want a new cologne with noticeable sillage and of course longevity. Colognes I have enjoyed: - Viktor & Rolf - Spicebomb* - Le Labo - Another 13* - Maison Francis Kurkdijan - Gentle Fluidity - Tom Ford - Lost Cherry* - YSL - MYSLF - Jean Paul Gaultier - Le Male* - Paco Rabanne - 1 Million * These are colognes I have gotten compliments on over the years (and asked what cologne I'm wearing) Chat GPT says that based on this list, my preferences are: Primary type: Warm spicy sweet, with a strong gourmand backbone. Secondary type: Musky, slightly woody, smooth ambers — to avoid smelling like a pure dessert. You enjoy: Seductive, cozy, slightly playful scents that still feel confident and modern. You avoid: Overly aquatic, green, pure fresh, barbershop-style fougères. Your skin likely amplifies sweet and spicy notes in a way that smells inviting, rather than cloying — that's why you get compliments. You handle denser, heavier base notes well (tonka, amber, woods) without them turning sour or muddy. Bright top notes (cherry, certain spices, soft citruses) add pop but don't define the scent for you. With all that, I'm hoping the experts of this forum can guide me to my next favorite long lasting compliment-receiving scent","I need help!

mov_95651F30C3BA85382716950A3EA8933D,"  Gracie Abrams is having a summer for the books. The 25-year-old singer-songwriter has spent the better part of 2025 on her Secret Of Us Tour which began last September, did her Glastonbury debut last weekend and today sees her opening for Noah Kahan at BST Hyde Park. “Playing at Glastonbury on a Friday was such a privilege. It allowed me the time to lean in hard into the festival, which I did. That was intense and perfect for me in a great way, but it's a rarity,” she tells Bazaar on a sunny evening at the Broadwick, Soho. Abrams, whose first album, Minor, released in 2020, notes that her post-show rituals are often a lot more “vanilla”. “It's a quick shower and I'll get in the biggest clothes I have. I'll journal for a little bit or read something before I fall asleep,” she reflects. In between performing in ethereal ensembles by Chanel and Rodarte (barefoot, of course), for loyal fans who get teary-eyed by her melancho-pop sounds and vulnerable songwriting, Abrams has signed on to front Hourglass Cosmetics' new complexion campaign. Abrams' clean and polished signature make-up look ties in beautifully with Hourglass' range of your-skin-but-better concealers, bases and the new Illusion Priming Moisturiser. Ahead of her special appearance in Soho's The Vinyl Factory, Abrams sat down with Bazaar to share the heartfelt story behind her bob haircut, the signature scent that reminds her of home and her go-to blush combination. On her beauty philosophy… “I tend to feel the most beautiful when I have the least on my face and when I feel the most like myself. It's really just about what makes you feel like you. [With beauty] when you find the lane that makes sense for you, it's exciting and inspiring to explore it. My mum wasn't someone who wore a lot of make-up but when she did a red lip, or something extra, it always caught my attention. I also love Alexa Chung.” On her skincare routine… “In the morning, I use cold water, sometimes ice cubes, because I get really puffy. I'll use a simple moisturiser which I got while we were on tour in Korea and then I use the La-Roche Posay SPF. At night, I use a benzoyl peroxide between those steps, without the SPF.” On doing her own tour make-up… “I like the time to myself in that way. I slot for 20 more minutes than I actually need, just because it's nice to have an hour of the day sitting alone in a room. I value that alone time very much, and I do think it's therapeutic. I'll listen to a podcast, I like On Being with Krista Tippett. The guests that she has on are always so beautifully spoken and experts in their respective fields, and she's an excellent moderator. [For my make-up] on stage it's really about emphasising certain features, because I'm so far away from so many people. Off-stage, I use a concealer for spot treating, a blush and do my brows. I like fine highlighting powders that both set and give your face some sheen. I'm not a lipstick person so I use a brown-ish lip liner and a glossy balm. For stage, I go a bit heavier with highlighter and blush. I fill my brows in more.” On her favourite blushes… “I'm obsessed with Hourglass Unreal Liquid Blush in Vision and Scene, and the Diffused Heat powder blush. I initially wouldn't have leant into pinks like that, but it's so nice on the skin and it's really sheer.” On her signature scent… “Another 13 from Le Labo always makes me feel like I'm at home. Smells are so important when you're away from home to make you feel like you're back there. But when we were in Seoul, Le Labo does the city specific scent and that one is a new favourite as well.” On her bob haircut… “I honestly feel the most like myself with shorter hair. It was off the back of, almost like a pre-break-up, when things inside start to feel a bit tangled up, and you feel like you need a change. I didn't know where to start so I cut it all off and felt so much lighter. People say hair holds memories and feelings. It felt good to sever ties where I needed to, which sounds harsh but it really was a lighter and nicer experience than that. I love it. I see pictures of myself with my long hair or I'll watch somebody else's show and they're using their hair like this extra limb, and I'll get jealous. I'll miss it sometimes, but I think overall, I feel way more like myself and in my skin with this hair. Bobby Eliot cuts it.”...","Gracie Abrams is having a summer for the books.

Just as a five-star hotel meticulously considers its scent profile to enhance the guest experience, you can do the same in your home. Here are five recommendations to help you achieve that level of sophistication: 1. HMNS – This is a Safe Space: A Sanctuary of Calm HMNS' “This is a Safe Space” isn't just an air freshener; it's an olfactory experience designed to promote relaxation and well-being. Unlike customary, often overpowering scents, this fragrance focuses on subtle, grounding notes. Think of it as the equivalent of stepping into a high-end spa – a blend of calming amber, sandalwood, and a hint of musk. It's ideal for bedrooms,living rooms,or any space where you want to foster a sense of tranquility.The brand emphasizes sustainable practices and non-toxic ingredients,appealing to the growing consumer demand for eco-conscious products. 2. Diptyque – Baies: The Classic Luxury A perennial favorite among fragrance connoisseurs, Diptyque's Baies is synonymous with understated elegance. This iconic scent combines the sweetness of blackcurrant leaves with the floral notes of rose and jasmine. It's reminiscent of walking through a lush garden on a summer evening. While a higher price point, the longevity and complexity of the fragrance make it a worthwhile investment for those seeking a truly premium experience. 3. Jo Malone London – Lime basil & Mandarin: A Refreshing Zest For a brighter,more invigorating atmosphere,Jo Malone London's Lime Basil & Mandarin is an excellent choice. This fragrance is a vibrant blend of citrusy lime and mandarin with herbaceous basil. It's a scent that feels both sophisticated and uplifting, akin to the ambiance of a chic boutique hotel lobby. It's especially well-suited for kitchens, bathrooms, or entryways. 4. Le Labo – Santal 26: A Sophisticated Woodiness Le Labo's Santal 26 is a more unisex and intensely woody fragrance. It features notes of sandalwood,cedar,and amber,creating a warm and inviting atmosphere. Imagine the scent of a luxurious library or a high-end men's grooming lounge. This is a great option for those who prefer a bolder, more grounding scent profile. 5. Nest New York – Bamboo: A serene Escape Nest New York's Bamboo offers a clean and refreshing scent inspired by the tranquility of a bamboo forest. It combines green bamboo, white orchid, and a touch of citrus.This fragrance is perfect for creating a spa-like atmosphere in bathrooms or bedrooms, evoking the feeling of a peaceful retreat.

Ultimately, the best air freshener for your home is a matter of personal preference.Experiment with different scents and find what resonates with you and creates the atmosphere you desire. investing in a quality fragrance can be a simple yet impactful way to transform your living space into a haven of comfort and style. In the increasingly popular world of independent perfumery, HMNS (Human Made Scents) has quickly gained a devoted following for its thoughtfully crafted and emotionally resonant fragrances.

Due to its immediate appeal and limited production run, it has become highly sought-after, frequently selling out at both the official HMNS online store and various fragrance marketplaces. A Fragrance Designed for Tranquility “This is a Safe Space” isn't simply a perfume; it's an olfactory experience designed to evoke feelings of calm, security, and renewal. The fragrance opens with a vibrant and uplifting blend of citrus notes – zesty lemon and invigorating lime – balanced by the delicate,soothing character of white tea.

Maison Crivelli - Rose Saltifolia • Salty sweet fresh rose. Beautiful daytime at the beach restaurant scent. Bjork and Berries - Never Spring • Reminds me of lemonade in the opening. Sweet and citrusy. Dior - Dioriviera • Light, dewy airy fig and rose. Malin&Goetz - Strawberry • Woody fresh, like a field of strawberries or taking a big sniff of an unripe strawberry.

J-Scent - Yawahada • The only milky scent I've found that works in heat without being too thick. The pear is delicate and juicy and the milk note is quiet but adds a lovely creaminess. Jeroboam - Floro • Fruity, musky. Similar to Valaya but pineapple and apple instead of peach. Phlur - Father Figure. Light fresh dewy fig. Masculine leaning. Vilhelm Parfumerie - Opus Kore • Acai berry note, really juicy and kind of reminds me of shampoo. Atelier des Ors - Pink Me Up • Date night rose for warmer months. Dark and jammy but not too heavy. Maison Crivelli - Rose Saltifolia • Salty sweet fresh rose. Beautiful daytime at the beach restaurant scent. Bjork and Berries - Never Spring • Reminds me of lemonade in the opening. Sweet and citrusy. Dior - Dioriviera • Light, dewy airy fig and rose. Malin&Goetz - Strawberry • Woody fresh, like a field of strawberries or taking a big sniff of an unripe strawberry. BTSO - Fig Porn • Juicy Juicy fig. Ellis Brooklyn - Miami Nectar • Piña colada. Jovoy - Musc Pallas • Beautiful airy clean skin scent. Ariana Grande - Thank U, Next 2.0 • Apple juice. Ariana Grande - God is a Woman • Pear candy. Xerjoff - Dama Bianca • Powdery sweet girly floral Dries Van Noten - Vanille Camouflage • Green figgy scent with a lovely cool vanilla dry down I could probably list a million more....",2025-07-08 18:51:27,en,REDDIT,,,,977a2e84ef441ddd7e0fd7255d02590c,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,"This appears to be a genuine, detailed user-generated review of multiple fragrances.

mov_60504A8B2DB130F23EFD2D38502F42CB,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Tuần trước, vụ kiện đình đám giữa Lululemon và chuỗi bán lẻ giá rẻ Costco chính thức được đưa ra tòa liên bang tại California. Tâm điểm của vụ việc không chỉ là cáo buộc sao chép trắng trợn các thiết kế đã được cấp bằng sáng chế, mà là một cuộc chiến ngầm ngày càng công khai giữa ""hàng thật"" và ""hàng dupe"" (hàng nhái chất lượng cao) trong đời sống tiêu dùng hiện đại tại Mỹ. Phải chăng, kỷ nguyên của sự xa xỉ đã nhường chỗ cho sự khôn ngoan tài chính, hay đây chỉ là một cơn sốt nhất thời trong bối cảnh kinh tế đầy biến động? Tại Mỹ, luật sở hữu trí tuệ rất yếu trong việc bảo vệ thiết kế thời trang. Trừ phi có bằng sáng chế hoặc bằng chứng rõ ràng về ""nhận diện thiết kế thương hiệu"" (trade dress), rất khó để các thương hiệu thắng kiện. Costco hoàn toàn có thể lập luận rằng sản phẩm của họ không gắn mác Lululemon, không gây nhầm lẫn và chỉ ""lấy cảm hứng"" từ đối thủ. Ngay cả Deckers, công ty sở hữu thương hiệu UGG, cũng từng kiện Costco vì sản phẩm ""mini-boot"" giống đến ngỡ ngàng, nhưng cuối cùng vẫn phải dàn xếp ngoài tòa. Áp lực kinh tế Lululemon cáo buộc Costco đã sao chép ít nhất sáu mẫu thiết kế đã được bảo hộ, trong đó có chiếc hoodie Scuba bán chạy và áo khoác Define – vốn là biểu tượng của phong cách athleisure cao cấp. Cửa hàng thành viên Costco, với mức giá chỉ bằng 1/6 giá gốc, tung ra các sản phẩm tương tự về kiểu dáng, chất liệu, thậm chí màu sắc. Ví dụ tiêu biểu như mẫu áo ""tidewater teal"" mà Lululemon vừa đăng ký thương hiệu chỉ một ngày trước khi nộp đơn kiện đã bị Costco sao chép trắng trợn. Costco không bình luận, nhưng ai cũng hiểu họ đang ""đi nước cờ quen thuộc"": bán rẻ, làm giống thiết kế và gắn nhãn Kirkland – thương hiệu riêng đầy quyền lực của họ. Điều đáng nói hơn cả là người tiêu dùng lại ủng hộ điều đó. Trong quá khứ, việc mua hàng nhái thường bị coi là sự keo kiệt đáng xấu hổ, gắn liền với hình ảnh ""hàng chợ"" kém chất lượng. Tuy nhiên, quan điểm này đang thay đổi chóng mặt, đặc biệt trong giới trẻ Mỹ. Nhờ sự bùng nổ của TikTok, Instagram và các hashtag như #dupealert, việc tìm kiếm và sở hữu ""hàng dupe"" đã trở thành một cuộc ""săn kho báu"" công khai, một biểu tượng của sự thông minh và khả năng tìm kiếm những lựa chọn thay thế tốt hơn, rẻ hơn. Các con số không biết nói dối. Một khảo sát của First Insight cho thấy, gần một nửa người tiêu dùng Mỹ đã từng thử một sản phẩm chỉ vì nó được gắn mác ""dupe"". Đáng ngạc nhiên hơn, 70% những người mua sắm có thu nhập hơn 150.000 USD/năm (12.500 USD/tháng) cũng cho biết họ có nhiều khả năng thử ""dupe"" hơn là các sản phẩm nhãn hiệu riêng khác. Không chỉ là quần áo. Từ son môi Dior, máy uốn tóc Dyson, đến nước hoa Le Labo, tất cả đều có bản ""dupe"" gần như hoàn hảo được bán tràn lan ở Amazon, Target, Shein, Ulta hay thậm chí… chợ điện tử TikTok Shop. Giới phân tích gọi đây là ""sự nổi dậy của tầng lớp tiêu dùng khôn ngoan"" – nơi mà giá trị sử dụng và vẻ ngoài gần giống quan trọng hơn logo hay danh tiếng thương hiệu. ""Ai cũng thích một mẫu thiết kế và các nhà bán lẻ sẽ cố gắng hết sức để thỏa mãn nhu cầu. Nếu Lululemon không bán hàng cho Costco thì họ sẽ tự làm hàng nhái của mình"", chuyên gia phân tích Joe Feldman tại Telsey Advisory Group nhận xét. Chưa kể, trong thời kỳ hậu lạm phát, người Mỹ – kể cả giới nhà giàu – cũng trở nên thực dụng hơn trong tiêu dùng. Họ không muốn bỏ ra 120 USD cho một chiếc áo khoác ""hàng thật"" khi có thể chi 20 USD mà người ngoài… không phân biệt nổi. Thêm vào đó, các nhà bán lẻ lớn và chuỗi thời trang nhanh luôn sẵn sàng nắm bắt xu hướng. Họ có khả năng sản xuất hàng loạt các sản phẩm mô phỏng nhanh chóng, đáp ứng nhu cầu thị trường mà các thương hiệu cao cấp không thể làm được về mặt tốc độ và giá cả. Hậu quả Quay trở lại vụ việc, vụ kiện Lululemon-Costco được dự đoán sẽ kết thúc bằng một thỏa thuận ngoài tòa, tương tự như vụ kiện Ugg trước đó. Costco có thể phải đối mặt với khoản bồi thường khổng lồ nếu thua kiện, trong khi Lululemon cũng có nhiều điều để mất. Nếu Lululemon thua, đây có thể là dấu chấm hết của các thiết kế thời trang độc quyền, mở cửa cho hàng loạt bản sao khác tràn ngập mặt thị trường. Bởi sau cùng, người tiêu dùng mới là bên quyết định cuối cùng đâu là mặt hàng đáng mua. Rõ ràng chưa có thời đại nào mà ""hàng hiệu"" lại dễ bị thay thế đến vậy. Và có lẽ điều đáng sợ nhất với các thương hiệu xa xỉ, không phải là hàng giả – mà là những bản dupe quá giống và quá rẻ. Đối với các thương hiệu cao cấp, đây là một thách thức lớn. Việc sao chép trắng trợn không chỉ ảnh hưởng đến doanh thu mà còn làm xói mòn giá trị thương hiệu, công sức sáng tạo và khả năng đổi mới. Nếu các thương hiệu không thể bảo vệ thiết kế của mình, ngành công nghiệp thời trang có nguy cơ trở thành một ""sân chơi"" mà ở đó, ý tưởng sáng tạo không được tôn trọng. Ranh giới giữa sự ""tôn vinh"" (imitation is the sincerest form of flattery) và ""trộm cắp"" (outright theft) trong ngành thời trang vẫn còn rất mong manh. Điều chắc chắn là, các thương hiệu cần phải tìm ra những chiến lược mới để thích nghi với một thị trường đang thay đổi nhanh chóng, nơi mà ""dupe"" không còn là một khái niệm xa lạ, mà đã trở thành một phần không thể phủ nhận của hành vi tiêu dùng hiện đại. Vụ kiện Lululemon có thể chỉ là một chương nhỏ trong cuộc chiến dài hơi giữa hàng cao cấp và hàng đại trà. Nhưng nó hé lộ một sự thật lớn hơn: giá trị thương hiệu đang bị thách thức không phải bởi đạo nhái, mà bởi một thế hệ người tiêu dùng không còn sùng bái logo thương hiệu. *Nguồn: FT, Fortune, BI Băng Băng Theo Nhịp sống thị trường Copy link Link bài gốc Lấy link! https://markettimes.vn/tiktok-lam-bung-no-nan-hang-nhai-tai-my-nguoi-co-thu-nhap-hon-12-500-usd-thang-cung-chuong-hang-cho-hon-thuong-hieu-that-86230.html","SPR_COMBO[vi]Tuần trước, vụ kiện đình đám giữa Lululemon và chuỗi bán lẻ giá rẻ Costco chính thức được đưa ra tòa liên bang tại California.
