mov_B6A3F559D41F6AE9BD0A524AACA163A3,"  Scouted selects products independently. If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission. Amazon has officially kicked off its annual Prime Day event, and the deals are some of the best we've seen all year long. Amazon Prime Day runs from Tuesday, July 8, through Friday, July 11 (the longest Prime Day ever!) , with thousands of Black Friday-level markdowns—including plenty of beauty deals on masstige, drugstore, and premium brands. Many of the featured beauty brands on sale (NuFace, iS Clinical, Too Faced, Estee Lauder, and many others) right now rarely get marked down, so this is the perfect opportunity to stock up on some of your pricier holy grail products or treat yourself to a new splurge without the dreaded buyer's remorse from paying full price. Scroll through below to check out a few discounted beauty items our editors are adding to their carts during this extended Amazon Prime Day event. Estée Lauder Advanced Night Repair Face SerumThere's a reason why this legendary anti-aging serum has been a cult-favorite for decades—it actually works—and does so without destroying your skin barrier. I rarely see this tried-and-true formula marked down, but right now, you can score a bottle for under $60. See At Amazon Free Shipping Too Faced Cloud Crush BlushDown From $31A powder blush that blurs fine lines, textures, and pores without compromising color payoff and staying power? Yes, such a thing does exist. Too Faced Cloud Crush Blush is the perfect cheek formula for those who love the effect of a cream blush but prefer a more velvet finish that lasts all day long. See At Amazon Free Shipping iS Clinical Active SerumThis multipurpose facial serum is an aesthetician favorite thanks to its ability to address acne, discoloration, fine lines, and virtually any skin concern one may have. The “results-oriented” serum is powered by a potent cocktail of, you guessed it, active ingredients, including vitamin A, salicylic acid, and aloe, to counteract irritation. This clinical brand doesn't go on sale often, so stock up while it's 20 percent off. See At Amazon Free Shipping Grande Cosmetics GrandeLASH-MD Lash Enhancing SerumDown from $36I have been a loyal fan of Grande Cosmetics' brow and lash-enhancing serums since I first tried them a few years ago. This lash serum works—and fast—without causing me irritation.See At Amazon Free Returns | Free Shipping Paula's Choice SKIN Perfecting 2% BHA Liquid Salicylic Acid ExfoliantDown From $35I was introduced to Paula's Choice by a dermatologist who recommended this BHA Exfoliant for my congested pores and budding crow's feet almost five years ago now, and it's still a staple I use nearly every single day. While the dark spot-earing elixir is reasonably priced in my book, I'll be stockpiling while it's 20 percent off. See At Amazon Kerastase Premiere Anti-Breakage MaskDown From $68Whether from bleach abuse or years of heat tool use, if your hair could use a little extra TLC, this spendy mask is where it's at. Yes, it's a splurge, but right now, you can grab a jar of this miracle cream for 20 percent off. See At Amazon Free Shipping LANEIGE Lip Sleeping MaskDown From $24There's a reason this Korean beauty lip mask is one of Amazon's bestsellers (and a viral TikTok product). Not only is it rich and hydrating without being sticky or oily, but it also doubles as a primer for lip products. Of course, you can use this before bed or as a lip balm during the day for ultra-soft lips.See At Amazon Free Returns | Free Shipping Murad Retinal ReSculpt Overnight TreatmentDown From $104This vitamin-A anti-aging serum is the closest thing to a facelift in a bottle. Yes, it's expensive, but it's worth every penny—especially when it's on sale. It's a great alternative to prescription-strength retinoids (e.g., Retin-A and Tretinoin), but it is more gentle.See At Amazon Free Returns | Free Shipping Oribe Dry Texturizing SprayDown From $52If I could only use one hair styling product for the rest of my life, it would undoubtedly be Oribe's iconic Dry Texturizing Spray. It smells incredible, isn't sticky, makes your locks look effortlessly sexy, and absorbs extra oil without overdrying or leaving behind a dusty residue. It never gets discounted, so take advantage of this limited-time deal. See At Amazon Free Shipping Le Prunier Plum Beauty Oil Superfood Antioxidant BoosterDown From $72This multitasking facial oil is one of the best-smelling skincare products I've ever smelled, but that's not why I always keep it stocked. The beautiful facial oil not only gives you a major glow while locking in moisture, but it also delivers a surge of antioxidants into the skin for reduced fine lines, texture, and discoloration. See At Amazon Free Shipping BeautyStat Universal C Skin Refiner Broad Spectrum SPF50Down From $125Founded by renowned cosmetic chemist Ron Robinson, BeautyStat's clinically backed and scientifically formulated skincare products never disappoint. I'm super picky about vitamin C serums because they tend to make my skin freak out, but this formula is magic in a bottle....","Scouted selects products independently.
