mov_140AD8ECB8F029D4AF306C03BEC0D836,"  Moncler teams up with Donald Glover for an Ojai-inspired collection, Regen Projects presents Kevin Beasley's “What delineates the edge,” FIFA celebrates the debut of its ready-to-wear brand in Beverly Hills and Eleventy Milano opens at South Coast Plaza Moncler teams up with Donald Glover for an Ojai-inspired collection Luxury fashion brand Moncler has teamed up with Emmy-winning actor and Grammy-winning musician Donald Glover on a new Genius collection inspired by Gilga Farm, his creative hub and retreat located in Ojai, California. Titled Moncler x Gilga Farm, the collection reinterprets Moncler's alpine heritage through a Californian lens, blending the brand's mountain wear DNA with Glover's focus on functionality, comfort and everyday usefulness. The collection includes quilted jackets, technical linen canvas, wool-cashmere knits, lightweight ripstop windbreakers and a standout burnt orange suede jacket. Other key pieces include oversized workwear-inspired layers, shorts, cotton tees and a convertible duvet jacket that transforms into a sleeping bag — a reference to Moncler's original sleeping bag product. The pieces are designed to be wearable in transitional weather, balancing practicality with relaxed style. Colorways are inspired by the Ojai Valley landscape and Gilga Farm's surroundings, featuring washed pinks, creams, oranges and pale blues. Natural-feel fabrics are used throughout and orange fiber — a nod to Gilga's citrus groves — is woven into select garments. The orange also appears as a recurring motif in logos and design accents. Footwear includes a simplified version of the Moncler Trailgrip Vela sandal, made from cotton ribbon and leather and finished with a pale pink Vibram sole. The collaboration also introduces playful design elements, including patches, comic strip graphics and a reimagined version of Moncler's Monduck mascot, shown as a farmer character across the collection. Animated care labels — voiced by Glover — reference the Monduck tag found in his first Moncler jacket, blending personal storytelling with brand heritage. “Functionality is key — it's something that connects the world of Gilga and Moncler,” Glover said of the collaboration. “We both create for real-world usefulness.” The campaign features a short animated film in which a cartoon version of Glover falls asleep at Gilga Farm and dreams of a Moncler alpine landscape, illustrating the merging of both worlds. Moncler x Gilga Farm is available now at select Moncler locations and online at moncler.com. A new book and exhibit explore Christian Dior's floral inspiration A new book titled “Dior Enchanting Gardens” explores the central role that nature, gardens and flowers have played in the creative universe of Christian Dior and the legacy of the house he founded. Published by Rizzoli, the volume traces Dior's lifelong fascination with the natural world, which began in his childhood home, Villa Les Rhumbs in Granville, and extended to other private residences including the Château de La Colle Noire in Montauroux and the Moulin du Coudret in Milly-la-Forêt. These locations and their gardens are presented chapter by chapter, offering insight into how they influenced both Dior's personal life and creative output. Flowers were a key inspiration for Dior from the start — notably in his 1947 New Look collection, which featured the Corolle line, and in the creation of Miss Dior, his first fragrance. The book connects these early inspirations to the work of Dior's artistic successors, including Maria Grazia Chiuri, showing how floral motifs have remained a defining element of the brand's aesthetic through decades of couture and fragrance design. Alongside text contributions, the book features rare archival documents and photographs by leading fashion photographers such as Henry Clarke, Patrick Demarchelier, Brigitte Niedermair and Paolo Roversi. Garments are shown alongside Dior's most iconic fragrances in a visual and historical survey that spans from the original femme-fleur silhouette to contemporary designs. “Dior Enchanting Gardens” includes a preface by Jean-Paul Claverie, an introduction by Brigitte Richart and essays by contributors including Philippe Deliau, Amy de La Haye, Vincent Leret, Barbara Jeauffroy-Mairet and Coline Zellal. The book is a companion to the exhibition of the same name, running at the Musée Christian Dior in Granville, France through Nov. 2. “Synth II” by Kevin Beasley (Source: Regen Projects) Regen Projects presents Kevin Beasley's “What delineates the edge” Artist Kevin Beasley returns to Regen Projects this summer with “What delineates the edge,” his second solo exhibition at the gallery. Known for his sculptural work that fuses found materials with experimental processes, Beasley continues his exploration of memory, materiality and spatial form through a new series of wall-mounted slabs and freestanding sculptures. The exhibition centers on the idea of thresholds — both literal and metaphorical — bringing together personal and cultural references. Using his signature cast resin technique, Beasley incorporates objects such as bedsheets, military uniforms, hats, carbon fiber, denim and shoes into sculptural screens that function like movable partitions. These works act as armatures for meaning, creating porous, layered boundaries that invite viewers to navigate the space through improvisation. Also on view are Beasley's “Synths” — large resin panels embedded with items like raw cotton, chipped pool cues, PPE components and T-shirts. The compositions reference both Beasley's personal history growing up in Virginia and broader cultural narratives, with the materials sometimes clearly visible and other times obscured. The title, drawn from musical synthesizers, reflects the work's aim to translate memory and emotion into visual form. The show follows Beasley's recent large-scale installation at Storm King Art Center and recent exhibitions at the Walker Art Center and the 15th Gwangju Biennale. His work is held in major public collections including the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Tate Modern in London and the Art Institute of Chicago. “What delineates the edge” is on view at Regen Projects, 6750 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90038, from July 2 to Aug. 16. Reformation x StyledSara debut the Sara Linen Dress Reformation, the cult-favorite Los Angeles label known for its effortlessly feminine silhouettes and commitment to sustainability, has launched a new collaboration with stylist and fashion consultant Sara Walker. The Sara Linen Dress is a ladylike midi crafted from 100% linen, complete with scalloped trim and buckle details that channel Walker's deep archive of fashion references. “I designed a piece that feels effortless and flattering, but still packed with personality,” she said. “The scalloped trim was inspired by a 1960s fashion magazine I've kept for years, and the buckle details are a subtle wink to a '90s runway moment I've never forgotten.” The dress will be available in three distinct colorways: Stampede, a chocolate brown zebra print; Nectarine, a coral-and-orange colorblock; and Parmesan, a soft yellow with crisp white accents. To celebrate the launch, Walker hosted an intimate lunch at the Chateau Marmont earlier this month. Guests including Tezza, Angela Fink, Gab Waller and Liv Perez all wore the new design, styled their own way — a fitting tribute to Reformation's blend of timeless appeal and individual expression. This collaboration follows a string of successful partnerships for the brand, which has previously teamed up with fashion and culture tastemakers like Kacey Musgraves, D.. .","Moncler teams up with Donald Glover for an Ojai-inspired collection, Regen Projects presents Kevin Beasley's “What delineates the edge,” FIFA celebrates the debut of its ready-to-wear brand in Beverly Hills and Eleventy Milano opens at South Coast Plaza Moncler teams up with Donald Glover for an Ojai-inspired collection Luxury fashion brand Moncler has teamed up with Emmy-winning actor and Grammy-winning musician Donald Glover on a new Genius collection inspired by Gilga Farm, his creative hub and retreat located in Ojai, California.

Titled Moncler x Gilga Farm, the collection reinterprets Moncler's alpine heritage through a Californian lens, blending the brand's mountain wear DNA with Glover's focus on functionality, comfort and everyday usefulness. The collection includes quilted jackets, technical linen canvas, wool-cashmere knits, lightweight ripstop windbreakers and a standout burnt orange suede jacket. Other key pieces include oversized workwear-inspired layers, shorts, cotton tees and a convertible duvet jacket that transforms into a sleeping bag — a reference to Moncler's original sleeping bag product. The pieces are designed to be wearable in transitional weather, balancing practicality with relaxed style. Colorways are inspired by the Ojai Valley landscape and Gilga Farm's surroundings, featuring washed pinks, creams, oranges and pale blues. Natural-feel fabrics are used throughout and orange fiber — a nod to Gilga's citrus groves — is woven into select garments. The orange also appears as a recurring motif in logos and design accents. Footwear includes a simplified version of the Moncler Trailgrip Vela sandal, made from cotton ribbon and leather and finished with a pale pink Vibram sole. The collaboration also introduces playful design elements, including patches, comic strip graphics and a reimagined version of Moncler's Monduck mascot, shown as a farmer character across the collection. Animated care labels — voiced by Glover — reference the Monduck tag found in his first Moncler jacket, blending personal storytelling with brand heritage. “Functionality is key — it's something that connects the world of Gilga and Moncler,” Glover said of the collaboration. “We both create for real-world usefulness.” The campaign features a short animated film in which a cartoon version of Glover falls asleep at Gilga Farm and dreams of a Moncler alpine landscape, illustrating the merging of both worlds. Moncler x Gilga Farm is available now at select Moncler locations and online at moncler.com. Source: Dior A new book and exhibit explore Christian Dior's floral inspiration A new book titled “Dior Enchanting Gardens” explores the central role that nature, gardens and flowers have played in the creative universe of Christian Dior and the legacy of the house he founded. Published by Rizzoli, the volume traces Dior's lifelong fascination with the natural world, which began in his childhood home, Villa Les Rhumbs in Granville, and extended to other private residences including the Château de La Colle Noire in Montauroux and the Moulin du Coudret in Milly-la-Forêt. These locations and their gardens are presented chapter by chapter, offering insight into how they influenced both Dior's personal life and creative output. More in Style Flowers were a key inspiration for Dior from the start — notably in his 1947 New Look collection, which featured the Corolle line, and in the creation of Miss Dior, his first fragrance. The book connects these early inspirations to the work of Dior's artistic successors, including Maria Grazia Chiuri, showing how floral motifs have remained a defining element of the brand's aesthetic through decades of couture and fragrance design. Alongside text contributions, the book features rare archival documents and photographs by leading fashion photographers such as Henry Clarke, Patrick Demarchelier, Brigitte Niedermair and Paolo Roversi. Garments are shown alongside Dior's most iconic fragrances in a visual and historical survey that spans from the original femme-fleur silhouette to contemporary designs. “Dior Enchanting Gardens” includes a preface by Jean-Paul Claverie, an introduction by Brigitte Richart and essays by contributors including Philippe Deliau, Amy de La Haye, Vincent Leret, Barbara Jeauffroy-Mairet and Coline Zellal. The book is a companion to the exhibition of the same name, running at the Musée Christian Dior in Granville, France through Nov. 2. “Synth II” by Kevin Beasley (Source: Regen Projects) Regen Projects presents Kevin Beasley's “What delineates the edge” Artist Kevin Beasley returns to Regen Projects this summer with “What delineates the edge,” his second solo exhibition at the gallery. Known for his sculptural work that fuses found materials with experimental processes, Beasley continues his exploration of memory, materiality and spatial form through a new series of wall-mounted slabs and freestanding sculptures. The exhibition centers on the idea of thresholds — both literal and metaphorical — bringing together personal and cultural references. Using his signature cast resin technique, Beasley incorporates objects such as bedsheets, military uniforms, hats, carbon fiber, denim and shoes into sculptural screens that function like movable partitions. These works act as armatures for meaning, creating porous, layered boundaries that invite viewers to navigate the space through improvisation. Also on view are Beasley's “Synths” — large resin panels embedded with items like raw cotton, chipped pool cues, PPE components and T-shirts. The compositions reference both Beasley's personal history growing up in Virginia and broader cultural narratives, with the materials sometimes clearly visible and other times obscured. The title, drawn from musical synthesizers, reflects the work's aim to translate memory and emotion into visual form. The show follows Beasley's recent large-scale installation at Storm King Art Center and recent exhibitions at the Walker Art Center and the 15th Gwangju Biennale. His work is held in major public collections including the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Tate Modern in London and the Art Institute of Chicago. “What delineates the edge” is on view at Regen Projects, 6750 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90038, from July 2 to Aug. 16.

El disco incluye colaboraciones de alto nivel con Natanael Cano, Kenia Os, Jared Leto (Thirty Seconds to Mars) y Natanael Cano, fusionando géneros como pop, corrido tumbado, urbano y regional . “Mentiras, la serie”, producción musical de Prime Video, se estrenó el 13 de junio y ya es la serie más vista en México . Su banda sonora acumula más de 2.4 millones de reproducciones, y revivió clásicos de los 80: Daniela Romo (+170 %), Amanda Miguel (+94 %), Yuri (+64 %) y Lupita D'Alessio (+90 %) . En entrevistas recientes, Belinda destacó que su enfoque creativo para Indómita surgió directamente del concepto: “indómita”, nombre que definió la fuerza interior que la guía .

In the 50s we sold evening wear, but nowadays we mainly do bridal, and some custom orders. I was closing the shop alone one night when I first met Betty. I had just closed the till and was about to flip our closed sign when a woman appeared at the glass door. She was stunning, ethereal really. She was taller. I would say about 5'10. Her hair seemed long, but was pulled into a French twist, the color of honey. Ivory, poreless skin. Light green eyes. She was wearing a vintage dress, lavender. She really was so, so lovely. She apologized for being last minute, but said she was eloping soon and needed to purchase something off the rack for the occasion. No problem, fairly common request nowadays with elopements being so popular. When I brought her to the rack she immediately steered towards our vintage line, picking out a classic Dior which everyone admired but left alone due to the cost. “Cost isn't a factor.” , she said, tracing the lace with her fingertips. I liked her already. She insisted to get dressed alone, and I obliged. I continued my busy work until she stepped out of the dressing room. I normally go through the same script in my head when a bride comes out in a dress. “Oh! Stunning! Your groom is a lucky man, he will cry when he sees your beauty!” But now. . I was speechless. She truly was the most beautiful bride I had ever seen. She sparkled, twirled, admired her reflection. “Oh this dress!” , she squealed, “I don't need to see anything else, I'll take this one!” “Perfect!” , I clasped my hands together, “Go ahead and get changed and we will get this rang up for you, it's truly your perfect dress!” She smiled at me, tears welled up in her eyes, and she turned and went behind the curtain to change. I was humming to myself at the register, thinking about what vacation I could book with the commission, when I noticed. . she's been changing for a while. At least 15 minutes. I walked up to the curtain. “Miss?” No answer. “Miss?

From Dior's intriguing new direction to Hermès' focus on sophisticated city living, and the playful energy of KidSuper, the menswear collections showcased a diverse range of aesthetics. This season wasn't just about clothes; it was about storytelling, cultural references, and a subtle shift towards comfort and practicality without sacrificing elegance. The shows signaled a move beyond strict formality, embracing a more relaxed yet refined approach to menswear. Dior's Artistic Evolution and a Nod to Wes Anderson Kim Jones' latest collection for Dior presented a compelling new chapter for the iconic house. The collection drew heavily from the aesthetic of the zoot suit, a bold and historically significant style. This unexpected inspiration was executed with Dior's signature tailoring and attention to detail, resulting in a collection that felt both fresh and respectful of its roots. Notably, the show featured a distinct visual echo of Wes Anderson's cinematic style – symmetrical staging and a carefully curated color palette – adding a layer of playful intellectualism. CNN provides a detailed look at the show's key moments. Hermès: The Modern Gentleman's Urban Wardrobe Hermès continued its tradition of understated luxury with a collection designed for the modern city dweller. The emphasis was on versatile pieces crafted from high-quality materials, offering a sophisticated yet effortless style. Silhouettes were relaxed and comfortable, prioritizing ease of movement and practicality. The color palette was muted and refined, reflecting a sense of quiet confidence. Nation.com.pk highlights the collection's focus on comfort and ease. Beyond the Big Names: KidSuper and Ziggy Chen Offer Fresh Perspectives While Dior and Hermès dominated headlines, other designers brought unique visions to the Paris runways. KidSuper presented a whimsical, fairytale-inspired collection, injecting a dose of playful creativity into the menswear landscape. Ziggy Chen, on the other hand, focused on lightness and breathability, utilizing linen fabrics to create a relaxed and airy aesthetic. These emerging designers demonstrate the evolving nature of menswear and the growing demand for individuality and self-expression. FashionUnited.uk provides a comprehensive overview of these and other standout shows. What does this shift towards more relaxed and versatile menswear signify for the future of fashion? And how will established houses like Dior continue to balance tradition with innovation? The Broader Trends Shaping Menswear in 2026 The Paris menswear shows weren't just about individual collections; they reflected broader trends shaping the industry. A key takeaway is the increasing importance of sustainability and ethical production. Designers are under growing pressure to minimize their environmental impact and prioritize fair labor practices. This is leading to a greater focus on durable materials, timeless designs, and responsible sourcing. Another significant trend is the blurring of lines between formal and informal wear. Men are increasingly seeking clothing that can seamlessly transition from the office to social settings. This has resulted in a demand for versatile pieces that can be dressed up or down. Finally, the rise of personalization and customization is empowering consumers to express their individuality through their clothing choices. Brands are responding by offering bespoke services and allowing customers to create unique, one-of-a-kind garments. Hermès' Summer 2026 collection, with its emphasis on refined simplicity, perfectly encapsulates these trends. DA MAN Magazine details the collection's focus on a modern city wardrobe. Similarly, 10 Magazine offers a concise overview of Hermès' SS26 menswear presentation.

mov_9D69E3A642C81C8B1FF9B627C5EF6351,"  SPR_COMBO[ru]Зачем люди собираются в книжные клубы и как они устроены В последние годы книжная индустрия находится в своем расцвете. Сегодня книги стали незаменимой частью массовой культуры: селебрити охотно позируют с новинками на камеру,  а бренды включают их в маркетинговые кампании. Некоторые просто начали скупать книги, чтобы казаться умнее и привлекательнее — одни ставят их как фон для видеозвонков, другие берут их с собой на прогулку как красивый аксессуар.   Книжные клубы также становятся новой популярной формой досуга. Все больше знаменитостей запускают свои читательские сообщества, где ежемесячно предлагают новую книгу и обсуждают ее с подписчиками.  Впрочем, сегодня, чтобы стать участником клуба, не нужно быть фанатом конкретной звезды — тематические сообщества легко найти как в офлайне, так и онлайн. Их создают книжные магазины, издательства, культурные пространства и просто любители литературы. Фото: Ugur Akdemir / Unsplash Механика книжных клубов довольно проста: участники заранее договариваются, какую книгу читают, а затем собираются, чтобы обсудить прочитанное. Формат встреч может быть любым — от офлайн-собраний в кафе до регулярных Zoom-сессий. Иногда книги читают вслух прямо на встречах. Обычно разговор ведет модератор — он помогает структурировать обсуждение, предлагает вопросы и следит за ходом беседы. В некоторых клубах к встречам присоединяются гости — авторы, переводчики, редакторы или книжные блогеры. Как зародились книжные клубы Идея собираться вместе, чтобы обсуждать книги, уходит корнями в античность. Еще в школе Сократа ученики рассуждали не только о литературе, но и о философии, политике и природе человека. Более привычный для нас формат появился позже — одним из первых стал клуб «Джунто», основанный Бенджамином Франклином в XVIII веке. Участники встречались по пятницам, чтобы говорить о литературе, а также организовали общественные проекты. Коммерческая модель книжного клуба появилась в 1926 году. Американец Гарри Шерман придумал подписной сервис Little Leather Library — за $2,98 читатели получали 30 небольших книг и шоколад в подарок. Позже проект перерос в клуб «Книга месяца», где редакторы выбирали важные произведения и рассылали их подписчикам.  Современный всплеск популярности начался в 1996 году, когда телеведущая Опра Уинфри запустила собственный книжный клуб. В рамках своей передачи она рекомендовала новинки, обсуждала их со зрителями и авторами. Проект стал настолько успешным, что вскоре за ним последовали другие знаменитости.  Сейчас книжные клубы есть у Сары Джессики Паркер, Дуа Липы и Риз Уизерспун. Последний — Reese's Book Club — стал настоящим феноменом: книги, попадающие в его список, неизменно становятся бестселлерами на годы. Только в 2023 году ее рекомендации разошлись тиражом более 2,3 миллиона экземпляров. Фото: Face to Face / Global Look Press К книжным клубам подключились и модные бренды. В 2024 году Miu Miu провел первую встречу своего литературного клуба в Милане, собрав представителей индустрии, журналистов и медийных персон. Chanel развивает проект Les Rendez-vous littéraires rue Cambon,  где они знакомят читателей с женской литературой. Dior также не остался в стороне — бренд посвящает литературе специальные мероприятия, приуроченные к новым коллекциям. Чем объясняется популярность книжных сообществ сегодня В мире, где цифровые технологии вытесняют живое общение, а ощущение одиночества становится все более распространенным, особенно среди молодежи, людям все чаще требуется так называемое «третье место» — пространство, отличное от дома и работы, где можно регулярно встречаться и общаться.  Книжные клубы как раз стали такой площадкой. Они дают возможность обсуждать прочитанное в кругу единомышленников, высказывать мнение, слушать других и развивать критическое мышление. Это не только способ взглянуть на текст под новым углом, но и повод выработать привычку к регулярному чтению и вдумчивому восприятию информации. Популярность литературных сообществ сегодня усиливается за счет внимания со стороны известных персон. Книги все чаще появляются в руках у селебрити, а книжные рекомендации становятся частью публичного образа.  Кроме того, важную роль сыграли социальные сети. В TikTok активно развивается сообщество BookTok, где пользователи делятся короткими отзывами, подборками, инсайтами и участвуют в литературных челленджах. Это вовлекло в чтение новую аудиторию и сделало обсуждение книг популярным форматом досуга.

Der er lidt af hvert – lige fra hylende morsomt feministisk hævntogt til en ikonisk western, afdankede pornostjerner, et barskt familiedrama og en hjertevarm hyggeversion af 'The Devil Wears Prada'. 'Promising Young Woman' Carey Mulligan tager sagen i egen hånd i 'Promising Young Woman' Foto: Focus Features Før kvinden bag 'Saltburn' fik os alle til at gå i kollektiv sexpsykose, mens vi kronisk havde 00'er-popsangen 'Murder on the Dancefloor' på hjernen og ikke rigtig kunne slette synet af en nøgen, dansende Barry Keoghan fra nethinden, var der 'Promising Young Woman'. Emerald Fennells fuldstændig forrygende, tankevækkende og ekstremt underholdende spillefilmsdebut, der sikrede hende en Oscar for bedste originale manuskript. Filmen har et guddommeligt soundtrack og handler om kvinden Cassie (Carey Mulligan), der forgæves forsøger at holde sit liv ud, efter at hendes bedste veninde går bort. Cassie får nu sine lange, ensomme nætter til at gå med at lege en form for sexet, kvindelig Batman-selvtægtshelt, der gør gaderne usikre for klamme mænd, der vil udnytte stangstive kvinder. Hun har et kynisk syn på hankøn og tror altid det værste. Cassie er derfor meget skeptisk, da kærligheden rammer hende i skikkelse af den vidunderlige børnelæge Ryan, spillet af klassekomikeren Bo Burnham. 'Red Rocket' 'Red Rocket' Foto: A24 Sean Baker, manden bag årets helt store Oscar-succes, 'Anora', er afgjort en af de mest interessante amerikanske instruktører pt. Han slog filmkarrieren an med 'Tangerine' og 'The Florida Project' og har siden vendt sit følsomme, forstående og imødekommende blik mod pornoindustrien og sexarbejde i 'Red Rocket'. Det er en morsom, men også socialrealistisk komedie, der handler om en falleret pornostjerne, der vender tilbage til sin hjemby i Texas. Hans navn er Mikey ""Saber"" Davies og spilles af 'Scary Movie'-stjernen Simon Rex. Mikey kan ikke finde sig til rette i hjembyen, der synes klaustrofobisk lille for ham. Mens han laver fejl på stribe, forsøger han at genopfinde sig selv og planlægger et storslået, sexet comeback til pornoscenen i Hollywood. 'Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris' En fornem greve (Lambert Wilson) og Mrs. Harris (Lesley Manville) deltager i et Dior-show i 'Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris' Foto: Dávid Lukács / Focus Features Hvis 'The Devil Wears Prada' og 'Phantom Thread' fik et feelgood-filmbarn, ville det være 'Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris'. Den charmerende, historiske komedie handler om en enke, der pludselig kommer til penge. Hun har altid sørget for andre, men på sine ældre dage indser rengøringskonen Ada Harris (Lesley Manville), at hun faktisk også selv fortjener lidt forkælelse. I et vildt forsøg på at finde sin drømmekjole fra Dior rejser hun derfor til Paris. Her kunne man forestille sig, at eventyret endte brat og hurtigt udviklede sig til den ubehøvlede sekvens i 'Pretty Woman', hvor den prostituerede Vivian fornærmes af snobbede butiksassistenter. Men i den her magiske, britiske fortælling er det modsatte tilfældet – og snart kommer Ada Harris på sit livs eventyr.

Her emmer stilheden før stormen af kugleregn i Sergio Leones mest ikoniske spaghettiwestern, der bugner af lange pauser, nærbilleder og intense dueller, der får en til at sidde på kanten af sofaen. I westernfilmen over dem alle tørner tre vidt forskellige mænd sammen: Den gode Blondie spilles af Clint Eastwood, der er en supercool og tilsyneladende hæderlig dusørjæger. Den onde skurk, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), er derimod en ubarmhjertig og hensynsløs lejemorder, der dræber uden at tøve. Og til sidst er der den grimme Tuco (Eli Wallach), som er en snu forbryder, der på listig vis altid undgår straf og snor sig ud af selv de mest håbløse situationer med skindet i behold. Til fælles har de alle, at de vil have fingre i en stor skat, der efter sigende er begravet på en kirkegård. Hver især har de små brikker af puslespillet, der kan føre dem mod enorm rigdom.

1lozl9k,"  Hello! I would really appreciate your help! I'm trying to build a simple, long-lasting base routine for both daily wear and small glam events. My skin is sensitive, acne-prone, and combination, so I really need something that: * Doesn't clog pores or break me out * Feels lightweight and comfortable * Lasts all day (I'm usually out from 6:30 AM to 7:30 PM, with gym after work — I can wash my face before the gym to remove makeup, but sometimes it's a hassle. That said, I'd rather have healthy skin, and the weather in my region is extremely hot in the summer and very cold in the winter) * I will be using that one product all over my face thinly for when I have events and such, but I only do that when there is something going on which is maximum 12 times a year and maybe even less. * Is actually worth the money (no fading, caking, or separating) **Budget for makeup:** I'd rather avoid expensive products that break the bank, but I'm willing to spend if it's something I'll truly use and not regret buying. I will be using that single product for a year or two, depending on its shelf life.

UgxHBWDe6zUAR4PAeQ14AaABAg,"  Aloha gorgeous, Wow, that Guerlain palette was made for you! So gorgeous, and I think you could wear it year round. For the Guerlain powder, I like the translucent all over, but more so for under the eyes, and any where I need brightening. It has a slight pink tint to it. The Medium powder I like all over, not under my eyes. It's a bit too dark under the eyes for me. I also love the medium shade if my foundation looks a bit too light, and it's gorgeous over a tinted SPF too. The powder is amazing, I agree with the container being a bit too big. I wish they would have included a smaller container to decant for travel. That would be great, especially for the price. I have to try a Guerlain blush, I'm having a hard time picking out a shade.I don't have a store nearby where I can swatch. Our Nordstrom is far, and they seem to not have much selection of Guerlain even on line. I'm not sure what's going on. My new obsession is the Prada eye shadows. I have 3 palettes, and I love them so much. Along with the Dior Cannage LE palettes. Have you tried the Dior Cannage yet? I think you would love Brown Cashmere. It's so gorgeous!! The formula is comparable to the Prada. I want to try the Guerlain shadows, but I haven't found a color story that resonates yet. Lately I've been into the smaller palettes versus large palettes. Just easier to put a look together when you're short on time. Thank you for your video, hope you're all enjoying the Summer! Xoxo PS. I love the Guerlain concealer it's lovely for the summer. I wish it came in a plastic container versus the glass, and the wand was easier to get out. I dropped mine on my tile floor, and it shattered. I order another one. What do you think about the Gucci concealer? I would like to try it, but can't figure out what shade.","Aloha gorgeous, Wow, that Guerlain palette was made for you!

Minis and maxis receive abundant fanfare, but the trusty midi is relatively uncelebrated, doing the hard work of clothing us for summer weddings and work events and everything in-between. Well, until now. This season, the midi dress finally found its way out of everyday rotation and onto the SS25 catwalks, where designers celebrated the calf-grazing style in multiple guises. The summer midi dress – be it figure-skimming and polka dotted or oversized and airy – is finally being given the attention it deserves. Consider a summer dress with an interesting neckline, namely something strapless or asymmetric. Specifically, we can't stop thinking about Versace's slinky, floral bandeau dress, which was styled with metallic chartreuse sling-backs and a mini bag (hello again, Y2K) on the runway.

See Simone Rocha and Tibi's offerings (which have pockets!) or Khaite's cut-out tunic dress, offering a glimpse of body beneath the swathes of fabric. On and off the runway, the polka-dot dress occupies a prize spot (pun intended). Notable mentions go to the 1990s-inspired, tomato-red, halterneck midi Kaia Gerber wore to the Tribeca Film Festival last month, and the wispy spot-print slip from Charles Jeffrey Loverboy's SS25 collection.

mov_AE68DC4D03200A163F33590A8D76A3BC,"  The global personal luxury goods market, valued at USD 410 billion in 2024, is projected to reach USD 526 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.24%. The U.S.-China trade war poses challenges, impacting costs and availability. Key trends include circular economy initiatives, online retail strategies, and urban demand in emerging markets. Segment growth varies, with watches and jewelry leading, while beauty and fragrances witness fastest growth. APAC remains the dominant region, driven by urbanization and digital retail transformation. Major players like LVMH and Rolex leverage strategic partnerships and innovation to maintain market positioning. Personal Luxury Goods Market Dublin, July 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Personal Luxury Goods Market Research Report 2025-2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Personal Luxury Goods Market was valued at USD 410 billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 526 billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 4.24%. The global personal luxury goods market is fragmented and characterized by numerous manufacturers that hold modest market share. Key players, including LVH, Prada Group, Rolex, Kering, and Richemont, among others, have established dominance in the market by continuously innovating and expanding their product offerings. Major vendors are strategically implementing innovative technologies to maintain their market positions. For instance, in 2023, Burberry introduced its virtual store by partnering with Blankos Block Party, a gaming platform, and offering interactive product discovery. The companies in the personal luxury goods industry are also focusing on several strategic partnerships with other providers to ensure continuous supply chains and manufacturing capabilities. For instance, in 2023, Kering completed a 30% acquisition of the Italian luxury fashion house Valentino. The partnership is between Valentino's parent company, Mayhoola, and it has also provided an option for Kering to acquire the remaining 70% by 2028. The leaders in the personal luxury goods market are making significant R&D investments to enhance the availability and differentiation of their products. For instance, in 2024, Richemont acquired Vhernier, which is an Italian jewelry brand, to enhance its Jewelry Maisons division. Furthermore, companies are increasingly expanding their product range and strengthening their market positions through acquisitions and partnerships. For instance, in 2024, Lavie Luxe launched its new 18% fragrance concentration perfume line, featuring four Eau de Parfum fragrances named LUSH, LILY, LAGOON, and LOVE. Consumers are increasingly interested in luxury goods that are designed with circular economic principles, such as those that can be easily upcycled. Gucci was the first luxury brand to use ECONYL recycled nylon in ready-wear pieces, which is a 100% recycled nylon derived from fishing nets, textile waste, and a thick pile fabric used for carpets and upholstery. Luxury brands have increasingly adopted online approaches to meet evolving consumer expectations. For instance, in 2023, Dior was the most popular luxury brand online because of its strategic investments in digital marketing, e-commerce, and social media engagement. This approach helped the brand to engage a wider audience, which has boosted its online sales, especially in markets like China and the US. Brands strategically position themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops in places like Bali and Phuket. It has created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. Hence, such factors are supporting the demand for the personal luxury goods market across emerging nations. As the global economies continue to grow, disposable income levels rise, leading to increased spending on luxury items like footwear. Consumers are increasingly inclined towards luxury footwear because of changing lifestyles and fashion trends. Luxury footwear companies are focusing on the growing consumer base in developing countries such as India and other Southeast Asian countries, where wealth and demand for luxury goods are rising. In 2022, Louis Vuitton introduced its exclusive footwear collection for the Indian market, which features new colors like Rani Pink and glittering designs for celebrating India's cultural heritage. Urbanization in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia continues to drive demand for the personal luxury goods market. In India, platforms like Luxepolis have significantly supported the development of the market by offering new and pre-owned luxury items to a growing audience in smaller cities, as the growing urban population increases the demand for high-end items. Brands are strategically positioning themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops to places like Bali and Phuket. Additionally, collaborations between fashion houses and hospitality venues such as Fendi's beach club in Marbella have created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS The disruption in the supply chain has led to increased costs for raw materials, logistics, and transportation, which have raised operational costs and are often passed on to end consumers which leading to higher luxury goods prices. The focus on limited production to maintain exclusivity significantly raises the production costs for luxury brands. Brands often face higher unit costs for manufacturing, sourcing premium materials, and utilizing skilled labor for producing limited edition items. This limits scalability and hampers the personal luxury goods market demand. Furthermore, major brands occasionally face backlash for products or marketing campaigns, such as Louis Vuitton for selling a scarf inspired by the Palestinian keffiyeh and a jacket that seems to present Jamaican culture by using the country's flags but incorrectly represented. These factors hamper the brand value and show the need for careful consideration in global marketing efforts. PERSONAL LUXURY GOODS MARKET GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS The APAC region dominated the global personal luxury goods market, accounting for a share of over 38% in 2024. APAC is experiencing a surge in urbanization and rising disposable income, particularly in countries like China, India, and Southeast Asian countries. A growing middle and upper-middle class is driving demand for luxury goods as markers of status, success, and aspiration.

I'll keep you posted ☺️. I haven't tried the Dior one but I keep thinking I need to order it, everyone loves it. Maybe I'll see if it's still available today maybe even look for a 4th of July sale or something 😁. Oh I LOVE the Gucci concealer. It's so nice. Shade matching is hard, but I really think that the formula is pretty light and flexible that you could make a big range work for you. IMO","Aloha I actually depotted both yesterday.

mov_0F616B39CDCF16B93AE3EDD8AD4F4C1C,"  An everyday lipstick, like any other part of a makeup or beauty routine, is inherently personal and varies from person to person. I've gone through practically every phase imaginable. At one point, a bright cherry red was my go-to. At another, I wanted a nude lipstick so subtle I could barely tell it apart from my natural lip color—the versatility is part of what makes playing with makeup so fun. Still, there are a few boxes that your go-to formula should easily check. “A great everyday lipstick is all about balance,” says celebrity makeup artist Ash K. Holm. “It should be comfortable, long-wearing, and easy to apply without a mirror.” Holm adds that a formula that hydrates the lips is ideal, but it also needs enough pigment to pull a look together. On top of that, it should fade evenly—no harsh lines as it wears off throughout the day. Sounds like a tall order? It is, but that's where I come in. Next to blush, lipstick is one of my absolute favorite makeup categories to test, and I've come across quite a few that can satisfy even the pickiest beauty lover. Keep reading to find the everyday lipstick that deserves a spot in your collection. The Best Everyday Lipsticks Best Everyday Lipstick Overall MAC Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick in Thanks, It's Mac! MAC's Lustreglass Lipstick, specifically in the shade Thanks It's MAC, is the closest thing to a truly universal lipstick that I have ever found. It's a taupey pink with a silver pearl, but don't let that scare you—the shimmer is virtually nonexistent in this formula once you swipe it onto your lips. One of my favorite things about this shade is that it can be worn with or without a lip liner, and it layers beautifully. Finish: Glossy Key Ingredients: Castor seed oil, shea butter, squalane (moisturizing) What I Love: Looks good on the majority of skin tones; Sleek packaging; Barely-there scent What I Don't: Due to the emollience of the formula, it wears off quickly Review for MC: “This is one of my favorite lipsticks of all time, and for good reason. It's a neutral-toned taupe pink color that doesn't veer too cool or warm, making it perfectly suitable for a variety of skin tones. It also layers beautifully with other lipstick formulas in my collection, acting almost like a traditional gloss by depositing color without taking over the entire look.” — Ariel Baker, Beauty Writer Ariel Baker testing MAC Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick in Thanks, Its Mac! (Image credit: Ariel Baker) Best Everyday Neutral Lipstick NYX Smushy Matte Lip Balm in Soft Smile This is a newer formula to my makeup routine, but I'm so glad I came across it. The Smush Matte Lip Balms sound a little confusing (mainly because I've never used a lip balm that's actually matte before), but once I applied it, I saw the magic in the formula. I'd consider this more of a blurring lipstick, similar to soft-focus formulas popular in the K-Beauty space. The shade Soft Smile, a brown nude, is the closest I've gotten to a true skin-toned match on myself in a long time, but it also works nicely as a neutral across a majority of skin tones. And as the brand claims, it really does blur the lines in my lips, creating a gorgeous, soft-matte canvas. Finish: Matte Key Ingredients: Dimethicone (silicone base that smooths lines); Ceramide np (improves skin barrier function); Shea butter (moisturizes) What I Love: 12 shades; Most affordable lipstick on this list What I Don't: Strong caramel scent that lingers for a bit before fading, which is a personal preference Review for MC: “This is such a fun lipstick to keep in my purse. Not only is it super compact, but the formula feels almost like a traditional silicone primer on my lips, and just like those formulas, it blurs the lines and imperfections on the area while depositing color—a win-win if you ask me. While it has a strong scent, I'm completely willing to overlook it not only for the unique formula but also the gorgeous nude shade that is Soft Smile, which complements my skin tone perfectly.” — Ariel Baker, Beauty Writer Ariel Baker testing NYX Smushy Matte Lip Balm in Soft Smile.

A longtime collaborator of Dior's, the Mumbai-based studio is renowned for its work in preserving and teaching an array of craft techniques, as well as creating immersive installations based on artworks. Nearly three decades ago, Chanakya's artistic director, Karishma Swali, first connected with designer Maria Grazia Chiuri and has since worked with her artisans to create immersive textiles for the brand's fashion shows, replicating and accompanying art by Judy Chicago, Faith Ringgold, Isabella Ducrot, and more. Earlier this year for Dior's Spring/Summer 2025 haute couture collection, Chanakya and graduates from its nonprofit, Chanakya School of Craft, created a backdrop of large-scale textile panels titled “The Flowers We Grew,” imagined by artist Rithika Merchant. The show's interior atmosphere was enlivened by nine large-scale panels that hung from the walls, each representing Indian heritage and values special to Merchant. Mimicking the brushstrokes and chemical composition of the watercolor paintings, the hand-embroidered collaboration took 306 artisans 144,000 hours to execute.

mov_CFEC879562AF3234331D44567D96AA6F,"  Evita, Palladium review and star rating: ★★★ Whole PHDs could be written about the publicity campaign for Jamie Lloyd's Evita. Hundreds of people are gathering outside the Palladium every night to watch Rachel Zegler belt 'Don't Cry for me Argentina' from the theatre balcony for free, a fun PR stunt that is getting so popular it risks being shut down by the police, while the ticketholders, some paying upwards of £245 per seat, have to settle for watching the performance via video link. And on opening night, Keanu Reeves, Jessica Alba and Pedro Pascal were some of the A-Listers sat metres from me who gave multiple standing ovations in the first act – not at the end, but half an hour into the show. It's common to see British acting titans at West End opening nights, but this random collection of A-Listers who aren't particularly known for theatre showed how far beyond the West End landscape this production has travelled. How come? It's from Jamie Lloyd, the zeitgeisty producer behind 2023's Sunset Boulevard, the man who is basically reinventing what West End shows can look like, so anything he does generates buzz. It also stars Rachel Zegler, who was most famously racially abused for playing Snow White. Lloyd uses live video effects and radical aesthetics (think the lighting and set design from a Wembley Arena pop show) to make the point that theatre can be bigger, louder and more ambitious. But where Sunset Boulevard was more of a gentle character study, Evita is primarily a series of phenomenal ensemble numbers. Ultimately it feels more like a music concert than conventional piece of theatrical storytelling. As for Zegler, with the straying of an eye or the tilt of her head, she finds depth in the Argentinian leader's story, finding warmth, confidence and vulnerability in the tragic figure. Evita is inspired by the real-life story of Eva Peron, a working class Argentinian who married leader Juan Peron and died of cervical cancer aged 33. She is viewed as a contradictory figure because she helped establish workers' rights and paid leave, and got women the vote, but also became an early Champagne socialist; for some, her love for Christian Dior dresses and the finer things in life felt at odds with her stance about equality. The show runs at three hours but feels half that because it is stuffed with utterly incredible choreography and the litany of musical numbers, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It's difficult to imagine that anything this stimulating has ever played in the West End before. And yet, I wasn't alone in finding Evita hard work. The outdated script introduces a range of historical characters without really putting them into context, or explaining their roles properly. The cast needs more space to tell the story with visual cues, but with barely any spoken lines – everything is delivered in verse as a rock opera – and a breakneck pace, the show is hard to follow for people who don't know the story well. I was relieved when, by the interval, multiple other journalists admitted to me they were finding the show hard to follow. It doesn't help that the production is also too loud, and when she sings Rachel Zegler's diction means she becomes difficult to understand. It's the same for the ensemble numbers: too often it's really difficult to catch what they're saying. It raises whole questions about accessibility, and the amount of knowledge audiences should come into shows with. Some critics will say cult musicals are designed for die-hard fans, but I tend to veer towards thinking shows should be able to be understood by newcomers. While this new production of Evita offers plenty of fresh thinking on the scope of the type of production values that are possible in these cranky, hundred-year-old theatres, I can't help but feel disappointed that so much of it went over my head.

You put your faith in the Gods as airport officials are hard to find and head through the scrum. The S-queues are neither clearly signposted nor explained, and the ""NO TIPPING"" video screens above immigration booths are the only indication of general direction. That is the light towards which the teeming masses shuffle. The green-lit automated immigration counters are for machine-readable passports only Others must queue. First fill out a health form using the QR code posted on a board as you approach immigration. Make sure your smartphone is charged and with mobile access and your passport/ticket details are at hand. You may have filled out and paid for an e-visa application for a VOA in advance and this saves time. You can also fill out a customs form in advance and keep the printout with QR code. This is to be presented after immigration. Your bags may or may not be x-rayed. Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport is tropical modern and friendly, but maddeningly casual. Still, it's part of the teleporting fun. And you will miraculously get through. Just believe. Arriving passengers face monster traffic jams — especially in the Kuta-Seminyak-Canggu belt, central Ubud, North Uluwatu and at times, while passing Sanur — but a 12km toll road to Benoa and Nusa Dua and the underpass at the notorious Kuta circle offer some relief. The slobbering Alsatians who sniffed me in parts unseen since my mother demanded my underwear for the laundry, are less in evidence at hotel security. Brusque guards with mirrors attached to poles continue with their bored routine. More fun stuff for families and romantics from golf and dining to island hopping and black sand in our Bali Guide. Departure is wonderfully efficient. Lines move steadily through immigration and the ultra-modern security check. You may get through in record time to sample some colourful but expensive brand shopping from TUMI to Quicksilver, Longchamp and Marc Jacobs. Grab a burger and fries or sample a last taste of Indonesia at the rightly popular Made's Warung. If you care for a spot of duty free shopping at Bali Airport, a one litre bottle of 12-year-old Chivas mid-2025 was roughly US$45, a one litre Johnnie Walker Black US$56 (compared with $33 in Bangkok) and a 50ml EDP of Miss Dior's Blooming Bouquet US$122.

Mange flere vil følge efter i denne og næste uge, hvor den helt store charterferie uge indledes. De fleste tager den obligatoriske tur gennem lufthavnens taxfree butikker, for her er det jo billigt at købe en masse rare ting, som man kan forkæle sig selv eller andre med på ferien, eller nå.r man vender solbrændt hjem igen. Alene ordet ”taxfree” giver indtryk af, at varerne er billige at købe i lufthavnen – og danskerne har ” altid godt kunnet lide at spare penge. Københavns Lufthavn har lynende travlt her ved optakten til sommerferien. (Foto: Mads Aarmgaard / Københavns Lufthavn) De vil dog blive slemt skuffede, viser en ny analyse, som pris-sammenlignings-siden Pricerunner har foretaget i Københavns Lufthavn. Pricerunner har kigget på 20 populære varer og sammenlignet deres priser i lufthavnens taxfree med, hvad man kan købe dem for ude i det ”almindelige” Danmark. Analysen afslører, at 18 af de 20 varer er dyrere i lufthavnen. Køber man dem alle sammen, er prisen 1.488 kroner højere i lufthavnens taxfree. Ifølge Pricerunner kostede de 20 produkter i gennemsnit næsten 20 procent mindre uden for lufthavnen end inde i dens toldfri område. Solcreme er uundværlig for de fleste, når de tager på sommerferie nu. Tjek dog lige prisen i og uden for lufthavnen. (Foto: Natalia Blauth / Unsplash+) ”Mange af os griber automatisk ud efter taxfree varer i lufthavnen, fordi vi tænker, at de da er billigere. Det er helt forkert,” siger Brian Kjer Sommer. Han er forbruger analytiker hos Pricerunner. Sandheden er en helt anden, og hvis man kigger sig om efter de samme varer ude i butikkerne i Danmark kan man få dem langt billigere,” fortsætter han. En af de helt klassiske varer i rejsetasken er chokolade, og her er en 100 grams Toblerone næsten dobbelt så dyr i lufthavnens taxfree som hos den billigste forhandler uden for. De trendy LEGO blomster butikker som f.eks. LEGO Botanicals Mini-orkidé 10343 koster tilsvarende 34 procent mere i taxfree. Her er prisen 229 kroner, mens buketten kan fås for 170 kroner hos en forhandler ude i Danmark. Denne slags butikker ser man mange af i lufthavne. (Foto: Pexels / Pixabay) Make-up og parfume er traditionelt også meget populære som taxfree. Det kan man tydeligt se, fordi de er placeret længst fremme og ved indgangen i lufthavnens store supermarkeder. Tager vi f.eks. den velkendte herreduft Emporio Armani Stronger with You EdP 50 ml, skal man betale 649 kroner for den lille flaske i Københavns Lufthavns taxfree. Uden for lufthavnen kan den købes 172 kroner billigere. Her i sommer er solcreme naturligvis uundværlig, men køb den hellere, inden I tager i lufthavnen. Her er bl.a. Biotherm Lait Solaire Hydratsant SPF50 i 400 ml beholder 20,7 procent dyrere. ”Det er velkendt, at priser kan være højere på de mest besøgte ferie-destinationer. Færre er nok klar over, at taxfree på vej til rejsemålet også er meget dyrere,” forklarer Brian Kjer Sommer Toblerone chokolade hører til storsællerterne i lufthavnes taxfree, selvom det sjældent kan betale sig at købe dem dér. (Foto: Hans / Pixabay) ”Hvis man i forvejen ved, hvad man gerne vil købe på sin ferie, er det klogt at sammenligne priserne med de danske, inden man tager afsted,” fortsætter han. Kun to af de 20 varer, som Pricerunner tjekkede priserne på, var billigere i taxfree shoppen i Københavns Lufthavn. Det var en bøtte med 295 gram Lakrids by Bülw A The Original, som man kan spare en enkelt krone på. Bedre var det med Diors Addict Lip Tint No. 542 Natural Sienna lipgloss.

mov_150F23C7BE9A090914854CCA8F191542,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Ein Sommerduft muss nicht aufdringlich sein, er sollte eine gewisse Frische ausstrahlen, verspielt-ozeanisch sein und zugleich mysteriös und aufregend wirken. Suchst du aktuell nach einer Duftkomposition, die dich an einen Ort der Erholung und der Sinnlichkeit entführt? Dann haben wir genau das Richtige für dich. Wir verraten dir, welche sechs Sommerdüfte aktuell beliebt sind und sich auf jeder Wunschliste wiederfinden sollten. #1 „Nivea Creme“ von Nivea Mit dem Duft „Nivea Creme“ gibt es die klassische und beliebte Nivea Creme auch als Eau de Toilette.

Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #2 „Nivea Sun“ von Nivea Suchst du einen leichten und angenehmen Unisex-Duft für die warmen Sommertage, ist „Nivea Sun“ von Nivea dein Duft.

mov_288F8824BE84655A34B1E28FF396C022,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Rihanna proudly displayed her bare baby bump on Wednesday, as she arrived at the Royal Monceau Hotel in Paris with her youngest son Riot by her side. The music superstar, 37, is currently pregnant with her third child with rapper boyfriend A$AP Rocky, with the couple already parents to sons RZA, three, and Riot, 23 months. She announced her exciting baby news in typically dramatic form, revealing her blossoming bump at May's Met Gala, where A$AP served one of the co-chairs. This week saw Rihanna enjoying a rare public outing with little Riot in the French capital, before the mother-and-son duo returned to their hotel. The hitmaker bared her growing bump in a cropped polo shirt teamed with a pair of very oversized cargo pants, and ballerina flats. While she toted the newly redesigned Book Tote from Dior, based on the first edition cover of Dracula by Bram Stoker. Doting on her youngest child, Rihanna beamed as she held tightly onto Riot's hand, while the adorable tot didn't hide his annoyance at the surrounding cameras. Her latest outing comes just days after boyfriend A$AP appeared to accidentally let slip the gender of their unborn child. The rapper was asked if the couple were set to have daughter after previously welcoming two boys, while attending the world premiere of Rihanna's new film, Smurfs, in Brussels on Sunday. On the blue carpet, Entertainment Tonight asked: 'Is that the girl you've been waiting for', A$AP immediately confirming: 'It is, man, it is.' The Everyday chart-topper - whose real name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers - then held up a plush Smurfette doll and added: 'Right here, you know what I'm saying? Right here.' But in response to the same question, Rihanna merely smiled coyly and replied: 'Let's see if it's a Smurfette...It could be a Papa Smurf. Who knows?' However, the singer did confirm that the couple would give their next child a name that begins with R, like their first two, adding: 'That's the one thing me and Rocky don't fight over.' When asked how many more children they planned on having, A$AP joked: 'We [are] going to be like the Wayans' family, you know? Yeah, I mean, love is beautiful and it's just [about] spreading it.' The power couple - who share matching 1988 tattoos to mark their birth year - originally met in 2011 when Rihanna first enlisted A$AP to rap on her song Cockiness (Love It). While they were romantically linked in 2013, after he after opened up for her Diamonds World Tour, they first confirmed their relationship in May 2021, when A$AP told GQ Rihanna was 'the love of my life'. Rihanna both produced and starred in Paramount Animation's Smurfs, playing the voice role of Smurfette - along with writing and recording original songs like Friend Of Mine. Smurfette was previously voiced by the billionaire's rival pop stars Katy Perry and Demi Lovato. Chris Miller's animated film will also feature Nick Offerman, Natasha Lyonne, JP Karliak, Dan Levy, Amy Sedaris, Nick Kroll, James Corden, Octavia Spencer, Hannah Waddingham, Sandra Oh, Alex Winter, Billie Lourd, Xolo Maridueña, Kurt Russell, and John Goodman. A$AP also took on an acting role as Yung Felony in Spike Lee's critically-acclaimed neo-noir crime thriller Highest 2 Lowest, which hits US theaters August 22 before streaming on Apple TV+ starting September 5. But there is still no release date for the New York native's long-delayed fourth studio album, Don't Be Dumb.","Have YOU got a story?

mov_0E38685FDFA51F6B7EF2BBA08A8C5A74,"  Paris Men's Fashion Week 2025 arrived with a quiet confidence. This summer season is defined less by spectacle and more by nuance. From Pharrell's global diplomacy at Louis Vuitton to Jonathan Anderson's subtle reimagining of Dior heritage, the collections echoed a world in motion yet craving calm. Craftsmanship met technology, tradition bowed to innovation, and desire found expression in restraint. This was a moment of elegance and thoughtful reinvention — the kind of fashion that invites reflection and adventure. Here's KHAMSA's roundup of the names that shaped the week. ١. LOUIS VUITTON – Le Monde est à Vous [embedded content] For his third collection at Louis Vuitton, Pharrell Williams staged a show on the rooftop of UNESCO in Paris, where diplomacy met design. A Damier-printed runway designed in collaboration with Bijoy Jain of Studio Mumbai. The collaboration set the tone for a cross-cultural vision that paid tribute to India's dress codes and craftsmanship. Dubbed “Le Monde est à Vous” (The World is Yours), the collection fused tailored safari silhouettes, cricket jerseys, and a new “damoflage” print in a palette of earthy saffron, khaki, and ivory. Embellished trunks, turbans, and luxe monogrammed cargos signaled a shift toward ornate utility. With live music by AR Rahman and Native Voices of Resistance, the show underscored Vuitton's message: global elegance grounded in heritage, movement, and meaning. ٢. DIOR – Jonathan Anderson's Debut Courtesy of Dior Courtesy of Dior Courtesy of Dior At the Hôtel des Invalides, Dior marked a new chapter as Jonathan Anderson unveiled his first menswear collection for the house. The designer, known for his sculptural work at JW Anderson and Loewe, brought a fresh irreverence to Dior's legacy, stripping back the theatricality of past seasons. Silhouettes nodded to the maison's archives — most notably the Bar jacket, here oversized and re-gendered — while loose cargo pants echoed couture gowns from the 1940s. The collection's quiet provocation lay in its restraint: historical references warped into modern utility, florals stitched as whispers, and tailoring that blurred between dressing up and dressing down. Set within a space modeled on Berlin's Gemäldegalerie, Anderson's debut redefined heritage as a structure to twist, not preserve. ٣. HERMÈS – Summer in the City Courtesy of Hermès Courtesy of Hermès At Hermès, Véronique Nichanian offered a study in air, light, and ease. The collection unfolded like a deep breath — technical yet sensual, refined yet grounded. Openwork leather traced clean lines across blousons and trousers, while a muted palette of putty, caramel, and mint gave way to richer tones like burgundy and vanilla. Shapes were fluid but never loose: shirt-jackets, cropped trousers, and soft parkas constructed with the precision of saddlery, but made to move. There was no spectacle here — only the subtle poetry of craftsmanship. This was summer not as a season, but as a texture: breathable, tactile, and wholly at peace with itself. Courtesy of Hermès ٤. SAINT LAURENT – Clinamen Courtesy of Saint Laurent Courtesy of Saint Laurent Courtesy of Saint Laurent Anthony Vaccarello's latest menswear show unfolded under dry afternoon light at the Bourse de Commerce, where stillness replaced spectacle. Inspired by a generation of artists who turned desire into form — and by Yves Saint Laurent's own 1974 retreat — the collection explored elegance through restraint. Waists were cinched, shoulders extended, and fabrics like silk and nylon floated close to the body without clinging. The palette, hushed and coastal, echoed sand, salt, and pale ochre. At the center of the space, porcelain bowls drifted in a circular basin — the Clinamen installation by Céleste Boursier-Mougenot — producing quiet collisions that mirrored the show's mood. There were no grand gestures, only presence, held with intent. Courtesy of Saint Laurent ٥. KENZO – Club Kenzo...","Paris Men's Fashion Week 2025 arrived with a quiet confidence.

mov_40D9ED93ACFBB2479F426AE4E07D0E73,"  It's rare for a West End theatre production to garner so much attention and excitement before opening night, yet that is exactly what Rachel Zegler has managed to do as she steps into the shoes of Eva Perón in director Jamie Lloyd's daring take on the beloved musical, Evita. Over the last two weeks of preview shows, Zegler has stepped out on to the balcony of The London Palladium, the musical's new home, mid-performance to perform a powerful rendition of 'Don't Cry For Me, Argentina'. ' I don't think any of us expected it to garner as much attention as it did,' the 24-year-old actor reflects to ELLE UK, the morning after Evita's opening night. 'People have been camping out for hours before I go on and it's humbling, beautiful and fits in the story very well.' Starring as Perón, Zegler has received rave reviews for her passionate, high-voltage performance which follows the life of the Argentine political leader Juan Perón, and his second wife. The dynamic show, set to Andrew Lloyd Webber's soaring score, dominated social media during its preview period and has now officially opened its doors to London audiences. Pedro Pascal, Sarah Paulson and Keanu Reeves were among the high-profile guests at the Palladium on opening night to see Zegler belt out beloved ballads like 'Rainbow High' and 'A New Argentina'. 'Sarah texted me last week asking for the link to get tickets. I had no idea she meant last night,' Zegler exclaims. ' Then, our ensemble member Harrison Wilde asked me backstage, ""Rachel, is Pedro here? "" and I said he probably would have told me. Then, during 'Rainbow High', I saw Pedro stand up. I was like, ""Dad, you're embarrassing me! ""' she jokes. ' No, he was so sweet. Keanu Reeves was there, too. I was freaking out!' For the occasion, Zegler wore a SS25 beige tulle Haute Couture Dior ballgown adorned with bejewelled bows, designed by the house's recently departed creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri. On her look, Zegler worked closely with her long-time stylist Sarah Tooley to pay a visual tribute to her character's legacy. ' It was so evident to Sarah and I that Dior had to be a part of the night because of the lyrics of 'Rainbow High' being ""Christian Dior me from my head to my toes "",' she shares. 'Christian Dior was such an influence on Eva's fashion in real life, so we wanted to pay homage and have classic elements as well as the modern, diva and Madonna-esque version of Eva. That's why this design was so perfect.' Having worked with her since the start of Zegler's acting career, Tooley is a stylist she truly trusts. ' She knows my taste, but she also knows my body and what I'll feel comfortable in. That's a testament to the friendship and trust [we've] built,' Zegler reflects. Her look was finished with fine jewellery from London-based brands Ananya and David Morris, a fresh, glossy make-up look and her signature soft waves on the hair, styled by Valeria Ferreira and Dayaruci respectively. ' I want to look like myself as much as possible, so I can be myself in a professional sphere where a lot of pressure is on,' Zegler says of her glam approach. The opening night of Evita followed two weeks of preview shows, in which the production is tweaked nightly before it officially opens. ' That is both exhilarating and exhausting for an ensemble group of people, so it was such a wonderful experience to lock it and get the response we've had so far,' Zegler reflects. Still, one thing has remained consistent – the unprecedented reaction to the electric moment she leaves the stage and heads to the the theatre's balcony for the musical's most beloved number. 'It's brilliant,' Zegler says of the scene. ' The second Jamie said that's what he was trying to get permission from Westminster Council to do, I said ""We need to do anything to make that possibility real. "" But, as simple as it may seem, it's a huge production as there are a lot of technology and hard work involved to show the theatre inside the Palladium.' Zegler shares that audiences inside applaud nightly when they see the amount of people waiting outside as it's 'such a ridiculously impressive thing to pull off.' 'When we first performed it, it was just me in a robe and my wig to figure out the lighting and sound for the show. The odd person would stop and take a picture, but the next day, it was 100 people, then 20o and it would double in size. It's overwhelming but really moving.' As for the critics, Zegler states there's deeper meaning behind the spectacle. ' It's a testament to the fact that this show is based on history,' Zegler continues. ' Eva was a real person and there is no world in which she would want to impress people who could afford to see a show at a theatre. She wanted to bring her message to the streets and to the people. Jamie integrates the modern ingenuity of theatre by respecting the source material in such a way that serves such a beautiful purpose.' It's clear playing this role means a lot to Zegler. ' It's a dream come true. I haven't been on stage in a musical since high school [for Shrek The Musical, famously] and I missed it so much... When you get to live your dream, you don't take any second for granted and I'm not, I'm soaking in every second....","It's rare for a West End theatre production to garner so much attention and excitement before opening night, yet that is exactly what Rachel Zegler has managed to do as she steps into the shoes of Eva Perón in director Jamie Lloyd's daring take on the beloved musical, Evita.

mov_3E7B54EBFBCE404FE724C963D393B0EC,"  The Starboard Group is seizing the moment. With the cruise industry experiencing a sustained rebound post-COVID-19, the Starboard Group, operator of boutiques aboard cruise liners and super yachts, has been rolling out new product initiatives and services ranging from personalizing jewelry and ear piercings, to tequila developed with the Invicta Watch Group. More from WWD Starboard also plans to launch a natural diamond program this fall, details of which will be revealed later this summer. “Cruising has never been more popular,” said Caryl Capeci, Starboard's senior vice president of fine jewelry and Swiss watches. “There was a stoppage of the cruise ships during COVID-19, and then it all came back. We've seen not only the number of passengers but also retail sales on cruise ships grow and grow and grow. And in June, we had record high sales volume.” During an interview Tuesday, Capeci cited statistics indicating the cruise industry is forecast to carry 37 million passengers in 2025, up from approximately 34.6 million last year, with expectations to reach 42 million by 2028. So an opportunity to capture greater wallet share from more passengers on board cruise ships exists. Last year, Starboard cruise line shops generated an estimated $800 million to under $1 billion, according to sources. Capeci declined to confirm the figure though she characterized Starboard's 2024 volume as in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Starboard works with 14 cruise lines, including Royal Caribbean, Virgin Voyages and Carnival Cruise Line, and more than 95 different cruise ships selling everything from beauty, fragrance and liquor to apparel, Swiss watches and fine and fashion jewelry. Through its cruise and luxury division, Starboard operates single-brand shops, as well as multibrand shops on ships. Among the brand shops are Omega, Brietling, Tag Heuer, Bulgari, Hublot, Cartier, IWC, Panerai, Piaget, Messika, Swarovski and Pandora. Also sold are beauty brands such as Dior, Chanel, Lancome, Clinique, Estée Lauder, Clarins and La Mer. Shops range from 100 to 750 square feet. The merchandise in the Starboard shops is duty free and tax free. Among the initiatives Capeci cited: Boutiques for Cartier, IWC Schaffhausen and Piaget aboard Luminara, the newest super yacht in The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, which was launched this week. The boutiques offer Swiss timepieces, fine jewelry and accessories, as well as private viewings, in-suite appointments and sessions with brand ambassadors to explore the craftsmanship and heritage of the brands. Also on offer are designer jewelry, luxury accessories and resortwear — from vintage Hermès bags and Stella McCartney handbags to fine jewelry by Ileana Makri, Lauren Rubinski and Sydney Evan. Ear piercing in partnership with Inverness, the ear piercing system, has been set up on 33 ships across multiple cruise lines in the past couple of months. Starboard says “expertly trained retail team members” administer the piercings. The debut of Invicta Tequila is for sale exclusively aboard 26 cruise ships worldwide, produced for the Invicta Watch Group by Mexico's Casa Maestri Distillery. Onboard tastings and personalized activations are offered. Engraving stations for personalizing jewelry are being set up. Mail-order services for most of the jewelry and watch brands sold at Starboard shops began rolling out in mid-May. Passengers can view digital catalogues on iPads to select styles, ring sizes or colors that not on the ship and have them shipped home. Rolling out financing through FlexPay with interest free, interest bearing and buy now, pay later options. The rollout began four months ago on Carnival and is being extended to all Starboard cruise line partners. “Most guests on cruises are celebrating something with their loved ones, whether it's a birthday, an anniversary or a family milestone so they come with a desire to splurge, to discover new brands and items connected to the destination they're traveling to,” Capeci said. “But most importantly, they want to mark the time with something meaningful, and we all know that jewelry and timepieces are among the most special ways to mark an event or a vacation, and remember time spent together with loved ones. For those reasons, most voyages we sell on do quite a nice business in fine jewelry. Fine jewelry and watches are probably 40 percent or more of our total sales. It's very significant.” Sales at Starboard's cruise line boutiques are selling at much higher rate than pre-COVID-19, globally, with the exception of China, Capeci said. “Pre-COVID, we did a significant business on ships sailing out of Shanghai and mainland China. That market has not returned. “The largest region in terms of retail value and sales is the Caribbean by far because of the sheer number of passengers that sail in the Caribbean and the size of the ships,” Capeci said. Cruises in Alaska and the Mediterranean, particularly summertime, also generate “very significant” business. Asked what's selling best, Capeci said: “Diamonds are huge. Yellow gold is huge. Materials that are connected to the destinations they travel to are very important. So if they're going to Australia, they want opals. If they're going to South America, they want green emeralds. The destination they're traveling to and the jewelry that we're offering are always connected. You could buy emeralds at home, but it's not as meaningful as it is when you just visited that location of their origin.” The Invicta brand, founded in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, in 1837, “is one of our most successful and longest running partners for watches,” Capeci said. “They're moving into more lifestyle-driven programs....","The Starboard Group is seizing the moment.

The debut of Invicta Tequila is for sale exclusively aboard 26 cruise ships worldwide, produced for the Invicta Watch Group by Mexico's Casa Maestri Distillery. Onboard tastings and personalized activations are offered. Engraving stations for personalizing jewelry are being set up. Mail-order services for most of the jewelry and watch brands sold at Starboard shops began rolling out in mid-May. Passengers can view digital catalogues on iPads to select styles, ring sizes or colors that not on the ship and have them shipped home. Rolling out financing through FlexPay with interest free, interest bearing and buy now, pay later options. The rollout began four months ago on Carnival and is being extended to all Starboard cruise line partners. “Most guests on cruises are celebrating something with their loved ones, whether it's a birthday, an anniversary or a family milestone so they come with a desire to splurge, to discover new brands and items connected to the destination they're traveling to,” Capeci said. “But most importantly, they want to mark the time with something meaningful, and we all know that jewelry and timepieces are among the most special ways to mark an event or a vacation, and remember time spent together with loved ones. For those reasons, most voyages we sell on do quite a nice business in fine jewelry. Fine jewelry and watches are probably 40 percent or more of our total sales. It's very significant.” Sales at Starboard's cruise line boutiques are selling at much higher rate than pre-COVID-19, globally, with the exception of China, Capeci said. “Pre-COVID, we did a significant business on ships sailing out of Shanghai and mainland China. That market has not returned. “The largest region in terms of retail value and sales is the Caribbean by far because of the sheer number of passengers that sail in the Caribbean and the size of the ships,” Capeci said. Cruises in Alaska and the Mediterranean, particularly summertime, also generate “very significant” business. Asked what's selling best, Capeci said: “Diamonds are huge. Yellow gold is huge. Materials that are connected to the destinations they travel to are very important. So if they're going to Australia, they want opals. If they're going to South America, they want green emeralds. The destination they're traveling to and the jewelry that we're offering are always connected. You could buy emeralds at home, but it's not as meaningful as it is when you just visited that location of their origin.” The Invicta brand, founded in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, in 1837, “is one of our most successful and longest running partners for watches,” Capeci said. “They're moving into more lifestyle-driven programs....",2025-07-02 17:38:00,en,WEB,,,,d17507a44ca3e1d06ef21d1e4a160cb8,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,This is a professional news article from Women's Wear Daily (WWD) about the Starboard Group's retail operations on cruise ships.

FULL TEXT A photo of Christian Dior's original salon stretched the width of the Invalides, the gold-domed palace where Napoleon is buried, offering a fish-eye view of the past to the throngs shrieking outside - and a sign of just where Dior believes it belongs in the pantheon of French power. Inside, dove-gray velvet lined the walls of a temporary event space and displayed two rare 18th-century oils by Jean Siméon Chardin on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland and the Louvre. Robert Pattinson gossiped with Josh O'Connor. Donatella Versace schmoozed with Roger Federer. A pregnant Rihanna arrived with ASAP Rocky a mere 45 minutes after the official start time. That's how much anticipation there was for the Dior men's show. The filmmaker Luca Guadagnino was even trailing around to document the moment. It was Jonathan Anderson's debut as the creative director/savior of the house, the first designer to be put in charge of both men's and women's wear. And under all the buzz, a giant question mark hovered: Could the former Loewe wunderkind reignite excitement not just in the brand but in fashion? Mr. Anderson made it look easy. Literally. Beginning with his take on the Bar jacket, the most famous Dior women's wear shape - the one that prompted the Harper's Bazaar editor Carmel Snow to jump out of her seat shrieking, ""It's a New Look!"" in 1947. It was reimagined in a Donegal tweed with a flat back and a whiff of the hourglass at the front, as if it retained a vague memory of what it once was. With it, he paired not a shirt but a stiff white stock collar and a pair of oversize white cotton cargo shorts, each side sporting elaborate folds to create the plumped out silhouette of a goose, or a 1948 couture dress called the Delft. Go on, shake your tail feathers. If little Lord Fauntleroy had spent a year at U.S.C. and then returned for a pickup game of basketball at Versailles, this is how he might dress. It was not a capital N New Look. It wasn't that radical, or shocking. But it was an awfully charming newish one. And it was situated smack in the middle of the tension between formality and informality, men's wear and women's wear, commerce and creativity (Mr. Anderson's own work at Loewe and Uniqlo and what he inherited at Dior), which seems to define this particular moment. No one is all one thing or another. Neither are their clothes. Neither are the totems of wealth. What Mr. Anderson proposed was a clear and convincing argument that contradictions can gracefully coexist. Most of all, he put forward the belief that fashion and wearability are not irreconcilable ideas - that you either have to look bizarro or look boring. For every highfalutin garment there was an equal and opposite this-old-thing, usually worn together. Velvet frock coats were paired with faded jeans in Japanese denim. Olive green puffer coats and down vests were cut with trapeze backs. The exact pattern of another classic Dior dress, the Caprice, with its elaborately swathed peplum skirt, was applied to a pair of loose khakis, giving one leg the fillip of a drape. An 18th-century frock coat was exactingly reproduced - in moleskin. There were shamrocks on tennis shoes and high-tops with driving shoe soles; cable knits under elaborate waist coats. There was a lot of neck action. Book totes borrowed, again, from the women's line, with actual book titles on them from Baudelaire and Françoise Sagan. Mr. Anderson had clearly done his homework. Easter eggs to early Dior were everywhere. Even the labels inside the clothes were in the designer's preferred silk faille. He was never going to toss everything out the window and start again. He couldn't. Dior is a multibillion-dollar business, after all, and some of his predecessors (Raf Simons, Hedi Slimane, John Galliano) were his idols. Once upon a time, a designer might have had the arrogance to wipe the slate clean, but this is a new age. The industry is in crisis, and the creative tectonic plates are shifting. It is why Mr. Anderson invited seemingly every other designer in Paris to join him at the show. It is also why he picked the Chardin oils and why he seeded his Instagram with Warhol Polaroids of Lee Radziwill and Jean-Michel Basquiat.

mov_2CCEF76AD199EDB8C9E6E24FF8B7DBCB,"  1. Rise in Fashion Industry Enforcement as Green Claims Directive Stalls In recent years, legislative initiatives have increasingly reflected the green agenda and sustainability objectives of the European Commission (the Commission). Authorities have been paying closer attention to unfair commercial practices, including the dissemination of inaccurate corporate responsibility disclosures and false or exaggerated environmental claims. The fashion industry has emerged as a key focus area, with national agencies across Europe intensifying efforts to investigate greenwashing, deceptive labeling, and misleading ethical assertions, especially concerning labour practices. In the past month or so, two pivotal developments unfolded: The first one took place on 25 May 2025, when the Commission formally joined forces with several national competition authorities in urging the online fashion giant SHEIN to comply with EU consumer protection laws. The request followed a coordinated investigation that uncovered suspected fake discounts, manipulation of reviews and ratings, deceptive product labels, and misleading sustainability claims. This joint enforcement action complements a separate, ongoing Commission investigation under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The DSA imposes heightened due diligence obligations aimed at ensuring transparency and consumer trust in digital markets on very large online platforms (VLOPs), and SHEIN was designated a VLOP in April 2024. The second development occurred just last week, when the Commission announced - and later clarified - its intention to withdraw support for the Green Claims Directive (GCD) unless the Council's proposed amendment to include 30 million micro-enterprises within its scope was removed. Micro-enterprises are defined as companies with fewer than 10 employees and less than €2 million in revenue. Originally unveiled in March 2023, the GCD aimed to protect consumers from misleading environmental marketing by requiring companies to have their green claims independently verified. The final text of the Directive had been expected imminently. The Commission's reversal is formally grounded in concerns that the Directive, as amended, would impose a disproportionate administrative burden on small businesses. At the same time, there is growing concern that the GCD's stringent requirements could inadvertently discourage companies from communicating their environmental efforts—a phenomenon known as 'greenhushing'—or worse, deter them from pursuing sustainability initiatives altogether. The uncertainty surrounding the future of the GCD should not be interpreted, without more, as a rollback of the EU's broader sustainability agenda. Rather than signaling a retreat from environmental regulation, the Commission's recent move reflects a recalibration of scope and priorities. It is now up to the co-legislators to consider the Commission's position and renegotiate the Directive's scope. Importantly, the rest of the EU's green regulatory framework—including measures targeting greenwashing—remains intact and continues to advance. We recall that just last year, the Commission adopted two key green directives that embed sustainability into the EU's regulatory fabric. The first is designed to empower consumers during the green transition, strengthening safeguards against unfair commercial practices and ensuring access to reliable, verifiable product information. The second introduces more robust requirements around corporate sustainability reporting, reinforcing transparency and accountability. Member states have until next year to transpose both directives into national law, after which enforcement — particularly around deceptive green claims — is expected to intensify. 2. Reform Milestones As consumer scrutiny of ethical and environmental claims intensifies, the EU has rolled out a series of landmark policies targeting greenwashing, unethical labour practices, and digital consumer risks — particularly in high-impact sectors like fashion. Here is how the regulatory landscape has evolved in recent years: 3. Overview of Investigations Targeting Greenwashing and Unfair Practices Across Europe and the UK EU Investigates SHEIN and Temu Over Online Practices and Consumer Risks The Commission's recent enforcement action against SHEIN underscores the importance and gravity the EU attaches to greenwashing, false ethical claims, and other unfair practices. In this particular case, the Commission is investigating a variety of other SHEIN practices, which range from the presence of illegal goods and content on its platform to the opacity of its recommender system that influences the range of products recommended to users first, through a parallel, complementary DSA inquiry. The Commission has also asked the retailer to provide information on the measures adopted to mitigate risks relating to consumer protection, public health, users' well-being, and the processing of data. Another Chinese e-commerce giant, Temu, received a similar request for information, at the same time as SHEIN, after receipt of a consumer complaint alleging that the exponential increase in Temu's user base is the result of aggressive marketing that may violate EU consumer protection laws, notably articles 7, 34, 35, 38, and 40 of the DSA. The company is under investigation for failure to ensure traceability of those trading on the platform; lack of transparency; and insufficient measures to protect minors and mitigate the risks stemming from the service's allegedly addictive design and illegal product listings. The Dutch Authorities Rigorously Pursue Greenwashing In 2023, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) updated its guidelines on sustainability claims, introducing stricter requirements around clarity, accuracy, and specificity. This followed a wave of enforcement activity that began in 2022, when the ACM launched investigations into corporate green claims across the fashion sector. It concluded that Decathlon and H&M had made vague or misleading sustainability statements. Both companies committed to revising their labeling and online messaging practices and agreed to donate to sustainability causes as partial remediation for their lack of transparency. The ACM also took part in a broader European enforcement initiative examining SHEIN's environmental and ethical claims. Separately, in 2023, the Dutch Advertising Code Committee investigated a greenwashing complaint against Primark, further highlighting regulators' growing focus on sustainability messaging in the fashion industry. From Armani to SHEIN: Italy Scrutinizes Green and Ethical Fashion Claims In July 2024, the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) initiated proceedings and carried out inspections at the premises of Giorgio Armani and Christian Dior for alleged breaches of the Italian Consumer Code in their advertising of clothing and accessories. The Dior probe was closed just last month without finding an infringement after the company gave a set of legally binding commitments designed to address any possible false statements in ethics and social responsibility statements. In September 2024, AGCM also launched an investigation against Infinite Styles for possible generic, vague, confusing, and/or misleading environmental claims made in relation to SHEIN's Italian website. The authority focused on the misleading use of unclear claims such as “'circularity'” and “'green' fibres,” lack of information on additional recyclability of the garment, and contradictions between the company's sustainability reports in previous years and its commitment to decarbonise.

In this particular case, the Commission is investigating a variety of other SHEIN practices, which range from the presence of illegal goods and content on its platform to the opacity of its recommender system that influences the range of products recommended to users first, through a parallel, complementary DSA inquiry. The Commission has also asked the retailer to provide information on the measures adopted to mitigate risks relating to consumer protection, public health, users' well-being, and the processing of data. Another Chinese e-commerce giant, Temu, received a similar request for information, at the same time as SHEIN, after receipt of a consumer complaint alleging that the exponential increase in Temu's user base is the result of aggressive marketing that may violate EU consumer protection laws, notably articles 7, 34, 35, 38, and 40 of the DSA. The company is under investigation for failure to ensure traceability of those trading on the platform; lack of transparency; and insufficient measures to protect minors and mitigate the risks stemming from the service's allegedly addictive design and illegal product listings. The Dutch Authorities Rigorously Pursue Greenwashing In 2023, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) updated its guidelines on sustainability claims, introducing stricter requirements around clarity, accuracy, and specificity. This followed a wave of enforcement activity that began in 2022, when the ACM launched investigations into corporate green claims across the fashion sector. It concluded that Decathlon and H&M had made vague or misleading sustainability statements. Both companies committed to revising their labeling and online messaging practices and agreed to donate to sustainability causes as partial remediation for their lack of transparency. The ACM also took part in a broader European enforcement initiative examining SHEIN's environmental and ethical claims. Separately, in 2023, the Dutch Advertising Code Committee investigated a greenwashing complaint against Primark, further highlighting regulators' growing focus on sustainability messaging in the fashion industry. From Armani to SHEIN: Italy Scrutinizes Green and Ethical Fashion Claims In July 2024, the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) initiated proceedings and carried out inspections at the premises of Giorgio Armani and Christian Dior for alleged breaches of the Italian Consumer Code in their advertising of clothing and accessories. The Dior probe was closed just last month without finding an infringement after the company gave a set of legally binding commitments designed to address any possible false statements in ethics and social responsibility statements. In September 2024, AGCM also launched an investigation against Infinite Styles for possible generic, vague, confusing, and/or misleading environmental claims made in relation to SHEIN's Italian website. The authority focused on the misleading use of unclear claims such as “'circularity'” and “'green' fibres,” lack of information on additional recyclability of the garment, and contradictions between the company's sustainability reports in previous years and its commitment to decarbonise. The CMA Tightens Scrutiny on Green Cla...",2025-07-02 19:47:28,en,WEB,,,,e2c7d4a441a505b3d8861e0845a23660,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,"This is a comprehensive, professional legal and regulatory analysis about sustainability claims and enforcement actions in the fashion industry.

mov_78143AB206C79744674BEC7A8B71B510,"  Luxury fashion houses are increasingly bypassing traditional media outlets and forging direct relationships with fashion creators through social media, offering exclusive previews and behind-the-scenes access. This shift, observed during the recent menswear season, signals a strategic realignment in how brands build hype and control their narrative. On June 24, Pharrell Williams, the creative director of Louis Vuitton Men's, personally messaged Albert Ayal, a talent scout for the fashion Instagram account @UpNextDesigner, with early details of the collection. “Hey — wanted you to be the first to see details of the collection from tonight's LV Men's show. Sending some pics soon,” the message read, originating from the @Skateboard Instagram account, Louis Vuitton's platform for behind-the-scenes content. Ayal promptly shared a screenshot of the direct message to his Instagram story. The Rise of the DM Reveal Ayal's experience wasn't isolated. Bally extended a similar courtesy to Scott Staniland, a sustainable fashion creator and consultant, sending him a photograph from the brand's Milan presentation, which Staniland then shared with his followers. Maison Margiela took a slightly different approach, directly inviting fashion critic Ashantéa Austin to its couture show via direct message, a moment Austin documented and shared as a reel. Perhaps the most proactive strategy came from Dior. In anticipation of Jonathan Anderson's menswear debut, the brand added content creator and fashion critic Hanan Besovic (@IDeserveCouture) to its Instagram “Close Friends” list. This granted Besovic exclusive access to sneak peeks of Anderson's mood boards and handbag designs, content she subsequently shared on both TikTok and Instagram. A New Era of Brand-Influencer Dynamics This trend represents a significant departure from traditional public relations practices. By directly engaging with key influencers, luxury brands are attempting to cultivate a more authentic and immediate connection with their target audiences. The practice also allows for greater control over messaging, as brands can share information directly, unfiltered by journalistic interpretation. The willingness of creators to publicly share these direct messages – screenshots and reels – further amplifies the brand's reach, effectively turning the initial outreach into additional marketing content. This symbiotic relationship highlights the growing power of social media marketing within the luxury sector and the increasing value placed on the curated perspectives of online tastemakers. The move towards direct engagement suggests a broader industry recognition that traditional media cycles are no longer sufficient to generate the desired level of buzz and consumer excitement. Instead, brands are prioritizing speed, exclusivity, and the perceived authenticity of influencer endorsements. This strategy is likely to continue evolving as the digital landscape shifts and new platforms emerge.

mov_0C31A16BA2532CF9CF37DA75CA81F56B,"  Change is afoot as fashion's musical chairs comes to a halt. When it comes to shifts in creative direction, menswear collections and the vision they represent have always served as the tip of the iceberg in signalling where the brand is headed. Often, they reflect a calculated risk or a tamer approach that holds more tightly to the brand's core values, in consideration of their male consumers and a smaller vernacular of silhouettes to play with. As Men's Fashion Week comes to an end, Men's Folio dissects the Top 5 trends for Spring/Summer 2026. FIT FLOP Where we come from, there has always been a slightly negative connotation when it comes to pairing open-toed footwear with trousers — anything but shorts, really. Can Spring/Summer 2026 usher in a shift in the perception commonly associated with a lack of sartorial care when one dons their slides or sandals with denim or chinos? As demonstrated by Hermes, Yohji Yamamoto and Dolce & Gabbana, what makes their trouser and chancla pairing feel like the epitome of casual summer dressing comes down to the fluidity of the trousers. A rigid dress pant may feel out of place, but lightweight materials that flow create a congruent impression when worn with sandals. This explains why the Dolce's “business on top, slumber party at the bottom” ensemble looks harmonious. DRAMATIC SUITING Suits in the summer should be anything but stuffy — across their construction, materials and finishes. The Power Suit takes on a slightly different connotation at Louis Gabriel Nouchi's Spring/Summer 26 collection, as he explores the notion of power through the lens of sexuality. Eroticism does not mean being unclothed, as Nouchi presents relaxed double-breasted suits styled with latex ties. Silhouettes portraying dramatic shoulders and a nipped-in waist take place, inspired by the Zoot Suit, are seen across EgonLab and Wooyoungmi, perhaps as a trickle-down effect from the last Met Gala that showcased facets of black dandyism. The most direct nod comes from Willy Chavarria during his PFW showcase, where the suit has been used to symbolise the identity and influence of immigrants, referencing his cultural upbringing. PRECARIOUS PASTELS Can pastels still be groundbreaking for Spring/Summer? Sure, answers Zegna, Prada and and Jonathan Anderson's debut collection for Dior. Rather than just desaturated colours for a demure impression, Zegna portrays a palette bleached by the sun from constant exposure, while Prada juxtaposed its simple silhouettes with sickly, off-kilter pastels that still commanded attention. Although Dior's use of pastels comes across as a display of affluence in ways an affinity for light-coloured clothing may convey a nonchalance towards wear, Willy Chavarria's take carries a form of rebellion worn on the backs of the working class. GO TO SLEEP, GIRL Amazing what rest and relaxation does to tired minds. Loungewear takes on a more literal interpretation — beyond just relaxed shirtings and short shorts for Spring/Summer 26. Dolce & Gabbana materialises the concept of rolling out your bed and starting your day immediately through a collection of pyjamas, worn together or as separates in all their wrinkled glory. AMIRI envisions winding down at their fictional Chateau through luxurious smoking jackets and matching lounge pants, complete with leather slippers. WHEN I GROW UP Through the lens of a child, the adult world may forge an impression of limitless opportunities and freedom. Before the concept of a business analyst or an SEO writer comes into their worldview as more conventional career pathways, there is an optimism tied to how work and adulthood are presented — as a pursuit of joy and self-driven purpose, rather than stakeholder value. Painters are seen on the runways, where childhood ambition is interpreted through paint-stained workwear at KidSuper and vests to hold paintbrushes at Homme Plisse Issey Miyake. Kenzo also proposes a joyful wardrobe that envisions adult dressing with a juvenile flair, through playful Lisa Frank-style illustrations, band jackets (also seen on the runways of Dior) and stickerbombed flat-brim caps.

2589BEB9B14AC7175588ED5AAA109DC6,"  A photo of Christian Dior's original salon stretched the width of the Invalides, the gold-domed palace where Napoleon is buried, offering a fish-eye view of the past to the throngs shrieking outside -- and a sign of just where Dior believes it belongs in the pantheon of French power. Inside, dove-gray velvet lined the walls of a temporary event space and displayed two rare 18th-century oils by Jean Siméon Chardin on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland and the Louvre. Robert Pattinson gossiped with Josh O'Connor. Donatella Versace schmoozed with Roger Federer. A pregnant Rihanna arrived with ASAP Rocky a mere 45 minutes after the official start time. That's how much anticipation there was for the Dior men's show. The filmmaker Luca Guadagnino was even trailing around to document the moment. It was Jonathan Anderson's debut as the creative director/savior of the house, the first designer to be put in charge of both men's and women's wear. And under all the buzz, a giant question mark hovered: Could the former Loewe wunderkind reignite excitement not just in the brand but in fashion? Mr. Anderson made it look easy. Literally. Beginning with his take on the Bar jacket, the most famous Dior women's wear shape -- the one that prompted the Harper's Bazaar editor Carmel Snow to jump out of her seat shrieking, ''It's a New Look!'' in 1947. It was reimagined in a Donegal tweed with a flat back and a whiff of the hourglass at the front, as if it retained a vague memory of what it once was. With it, he paired not a shirt but a stiff white stock collar and a pair of oversize white cotton cargo shorts, each side sporting elaborate folds to create the plumped out silhouette of a goose, or a 1948 couture dress called the Delft. Go on, shake your tail feathers. If little Lord Fauntleroy had spent a year at U.S.C. and then returned for a pickup game of basketball at Versailles, this is how he might dress. It was not a capital N New Look. It wasn't that radical, or shocking. But it was an awfully charming newish one. And it was situated smack in the middle of the tension between formality and informality, men's wear and women's wear, commerce and creativity (Mr. Anderson's own work at Loewe and Uniqlo and what he inherited at Dior), which seems to define this particular moment. No one is all one thing or another. Neither are their clothes. Neither are the totems of wealth. What Mr. Anderson proposed was a clear and convincing argument that contradictions can gracefully coexist. Most of all, he put forward the belief that fashion and wearability are not irreconcilable ideas -- that you either have to look bizarro or look boring. For every highfalutin garment there was an equal and opposite this-old-thing, usually worn together. Velvet frock coats were paired with faded jeans in Japanese denim. Olive green puffer coats and down vests were cut with trapeze backs. The exact pattern of another classic Dior dress, the Caprice, with its elaborately swathed peplum skirt, was applied to a pair of loose khakis, giving one leg the fillip of a drape. An 18th-century frock coat was exactingly reproduced -- in moleskin. There were shamrocks on tennis shoes and high-tops with driving shoe soles; cable knits under elaborate waist coats. There was a lot of neck action. Book totes borrowed, again, from the women's line, with actual book titles on them from Baudelaire and Françoise Sagan. Mr. Anderson had clearly done his homework. Easter eggs to early Dior were everywhere. Even the labels inside the clothes were in the designer's preferred silk faille. He was never going to toss everything out the window and start again. He couldn't. Dior is a multibillion-dollar business, after all, and some of his predecessors (Raf Simons, Hedi Slimane, John Galliano) were his idols. Once upon a time, a designer might have had the arrogance to wipe the slate clean, but this is a new age. The industry is in crisis, and the creative tectonic plates are shifting. It is why Mr. Anderson invited seemingly every other designer in Paris to join him at the show. It is also why he picked the Chardin oils and why he seeded his Instagram with Warhol Polaroids of Lee Radziwill and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Chardin, he said in a preview, ''kind of loosened up the still life''; Warhol made pop culture high art. Both crystallized an inflection point in culture. Mr. Anderson clearly wants his Dior to do the same. His show invitation came borne on a china plate with three china eggs on top, as if a reminder that the men's wear was just the beginning (and maybe to acknowledge that some shells may get broken along the way). Fair enough. The result may not knock you sideways, but it's likely to make you sit up and buy....","A photo of Christian Dior's original salon stretched the width of the Invalides, the gold-domed palace where Napoleon is buried, offering a fish-eye view of the past to the throngs shrieking outside -- and a sign of just where Dior believes it belongs in the pantheon of French power. Inside, dove-gray velvet lined the walls of a temporary event space and displayed two rare 18th-century oils by Jean Siméon Chardin on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland and the Louvre. Robert Pattinson gossiped with Josh O'Connor. Donatella Versace schmoozed with Roger Federer. A pregnant Rihanna arrived with ASAP Rocky a mere 45 minutes after the official start time. That's how much anticipation there was for the Dior men's show. The filmmaker Luca Guadagnino was even trailing around to document the moment. It was Jonathan Anderson's debut as the creative director/savior of the house, the first designer to be put in charge of both men's and women's wear. And under all the buzz, a giant question mark hovered: Could the former Loewe wunderkind reignite excitement not just in the brand but in fashion? Mr. Anderson made it look easy. Literally. Beginning with his take on the Bar jacket, the most famous Dior women's wear shape -- the one that prompted the Harper's Bazaar editor Carmel Snow to jump out of her seat shrieking, ''It's a New Look!'' in 1947. It was reimagined in a Donegal tweed with a flat back and a whiff of the hourglass at the front, as if it retained a vague memory of what it once was. With it, he paired not a shirt but a stiff white stock collar and a pair of oversize white cotton cargo shorts, each side sporting elaborate folds to create the plumped out silhouette of a goose, or a 1948 couture dress called the Delft. Go on, shake your tail feathers. If little Lord Fauntleroy had spent a year at U.S.C. and then returned for a pickup game of basketball at Versailles, this is how he might dress. It was not a capital N New Look. It wasn't that radical, or shocking. But it was an awfully charming newish one. And it was situated smack in the middle of the tension between formality and informality, men's wear and women's wear, commerce and creativity (Mr. Anderson's own work at Loewe and Uniqlo and what he inherited at Dior), which seems to define this particular moment. No one is all one thing or another. Neither are their clothes. Neither are the totems of wealth. What Mr. Anderson proposed was a clear and convincing argument that contradictions can gracefully coexist. Most of all, he put forward the belief that fashion and wearability are not irreconcilable ideas -- that you either have to look bizarro or look boring. For every highfalutin garment there was an equal and opposite this-old-thing, usually worn together. Velvet frock coats were paired with faded jeans in Japanese denim. Olive green puffer coats and down vests were cut with trapeze backs. The exact pattern of another classic Dior dress, the Caprice, with its elaborately swathed peplum skirt, was applied to a pair of loose khakis, giving one leg the fillip of a drape. An 18th-century frock coat was exactingly reproduced -- in moleskin. There were shamrocks on tennis shoes and high-tops with driving shoe soles; cable knits under elaborate waist coats. There was a lot of neck action. Book totes borrowed, again, from the women's line, with actual book titles on them from Baudelaire and Françoise Sagan. Mr. Anderson had clearly done his homework. Easter eggs to early Dior were everywhere. Even the labels inside the clothes were in the designer's preferred silk faille. He was never going to toss everything out the window and start again. He couldn't. Dior is a multibillion-dollar business, after all, and some of his predecessors (Raf Simons, Hedi Slimane, John Galliano) were his idols. Once upon a time, a designer might have had the arrogance to wipe the slate clean, but this is a new age. The industry is in crisis, and the creative tectonic plates are shifting. It is why Mr. Anderson invited seemingly every other designer in Paris to join him at the show. It is also why he picked the Chardin oils and why he seeded his Instagram with Warhol Polaroids of Lee Radziwill and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Chardin, he said in a preview, ''kind of loosened up the still life''; Warhol made pop culture high art. Both crystallized an inflection point in culture. Mr. Anderson clearly wants his Dior to do the same. His show invitation came borne on a china plate with three china eggs on top, as if a reminder that the men's wear was just the beginning (and maybe to acknowledge that some shells may get broken along the way).

On Friday in Paris, the Northern Irish designer Jonathan Anderson will show his first collection as the creative director of the French fashion house Dior. During his previous, 11-year tenure as the creative director of the Spanish brand Loewe, Anderson became known for his avant-garde sensibility and dedication to craft -- but also for his unique ability to turn the internet's so-called boyfriends (those young actors and musicians who are lusted over online with possessive familiarity) into bona fide celebrities. In the front row of Anderson's fall 2024 Loewe men's wear show in Paris were the established actors Jamie Dornan, Andrew Garfield and Nicholas Hoult, but also, seated with equal prominence, emerging ones, including Drew Starkey, who was set to star in ''Queer'' (the 2024 Luca Guadagnino movie for which Anderson oversaw the costumes), and Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist, who would soon appear as romantic leads in Guadagnino's film ''Challengers,'' a film that helped them reach mainstream heartthrob status, and with which Anderson was also involved as a costume designer. The following June, at Anderson's final Loewe men's runway show, the rising actors Kit Connor, Evan Peters and Enzo Vogrincic sat front row -- suggesting, based on the strength of the designer's track record, that they too would also soon become leading men. For Loewe, it was a display of cultural currency; for the actors, it was free publicity. It used to be that an association with a brand was, if not a career-killer, then certainly not chic for an actor. It was hard to be taken seriously as both an artist and a de facto fashion model. But in recent decades, the rise of social media and the expansion of the fashion industry have blurred the lines between model, actor and influencer. Back in the 1980s, the Italian fashion house Armani began dressing Hollywood celebrities, including, most notably, Richard Gere for his role in the 1980 movie ''American Gigolo.'' But gone are the days when one megastar served as a company's global face. Today brands adopt a multitiered system of ambassadors that includes international stars, yes, but also up-and-comers and influencers. While these cliques are often described by their members and parent brands as ''family,'' and frequently represent a genuine affinity, they are also carefully constructed to maximize a company's exposure on red carpets and billboards -- but also very specific corners of TikTok. Now, as this business decision solidifies into standard practice, the question is, Who ultimately wields the power, the celebrities or the brands? Until 2010, ''a few brands had ambassadors, but it was mainly for fragrance,'' says Ben Cercio, the founder of a consulting agency specializing in brand strategy and communications with clients including the French fashion house Givenchy. But with the launch of Instagram that year, a shift occurred: companies began to engage not just with major actors but also with ''microinfluencers'' -- online personalities with less than 100,000 followers -- to reach their audiences early on. And because social media has accelerated the rise to fame, whenever a new talent in any field emerges from the crowd, ''every brand wants to get its hands on them,'' says Cercio. Now an ingénue like the actress Mikey Madison, who starred in last year's ''Anora,'' might have a dozen offers from brands immediately after making a buzzy debut at a festival like Cannes, suggesting that it's often the young actors, rather than the brands, who are in control. When Madison accepted her Oscar for best lead actress in March, she wore a custom look from Dior. Cercio adds that while relationships once developed organically -- a talent would come to a fashion show, be given some pieces and maybe wear something from the latest collection on the red carpet -- increasingly, ''money is very quickly involved.'' Indeed, an ambassadorship is now a coveted deal among celebrities of all tiers. '' There's enough proof in the market of just how great a partnership can look,'' says George Georgopoulos, the director of brand partnerships at Huxley, an agency that represents artists including Charli XCX. After releasing her globally successful album ''Brat,'' last summer, the pop star partnered with companies from H&M to Acne Studios and performed with a seemingly empty Gucci bag on ''Saturday Night Live'' in what appeared to be a wink-wink placement. (She'd headlined the brand's annual LACMA Gala a few weeks before.) Getting a check for simply holding an object, she seemed to imply, was not selling out but making the system work for her. For many celebrities, ''there's more money in the ambassadorship than in a lot of the payments they receive for their work onscreen,'' says the writer and pop culture podcaster Evan Ross Katz. Those funds can free up major actors to pursue less commercial projects, like indie films and plays; they are also increasingly essential for younger performers who aren't yet earning large sums for their creative work. Depending on their level of fame, a celebrity can make anywhere from $50,000 to many millions of dollars with endorsement deals, according to several people who work on confidential contracts. On the lower end are social media posts: An artist with a significant following could be paid $100,000 to $150,000 for a single main-grid post holding a product and tagging a brand. If their following is in the multiple millions, however, these numbers can reach seven figures, one stylist said. Slightly more lucrative are red-carpet appearances. And on the higher end are elaborate contracts that require more than just showing up at Fashion Week twice a year. A deal worth around $3 million, for example, could involve appearing in advertising campaigns, attending events like store openings, being dressed for the red carpet, wearing the brand out more casually for paparazzi shots and creating several social media posts. The prestige of an endorsement deal can also boost the cachet of a relatively unknown artist or internet personality immeasurably. Katz cites the YouTuber Emma Chamberlain and the pop star Addison Rae as two recent examples of social media stars whose fame has grown well beyond their original audience, partly because of their fashion partnerships. Since 2019, Chamberlain has been an ambassador for Louis Vuitton; last year, Rae appeared in a campaign film for Saint Laurent. Likewise, while celebrity ambassadors might not necessarily move units for brands in the short term -- unless they have the influence of a Kardashian or a Hadid -- they give companies exposure to niche but devoted audiences. By putting the actor Jeremy Allen White on a billboard, for example, Calvin Klein helped transform a nascent sex symbol into the kind of established idol the brand more typically casts -- and it got to be a part of the cultural conversation following the success of White's show ''The Bear.'' And when, last summer, Marc Jacobs recruited the viral TikTok chef Nara Smith to ''make'' one of the brand's tote bags from baking ingredients in a tongue-in-cheek video, Smith gained fashion credibility, while the brand got to create a social media moment of its own. Both parties signaled that they were in on the joke. But not all relationships are the right match. '' I remember this desire for fashion to lead the conversation and not follow it,'' says Katz. '' Part of me worries that that's beginning to shift.'' Still, brands are continuing to experiment with new models...","And what's in it for the brands?

Y para lograrlo sin 17 productos ni gastar una fortuna, entra en escena Rimmel London Sculpting Palette, una joya low cost con tres tonos que trabajan en sinergia: bronceador, iluminador y colorete, todo en un compacto que cabe en cualquier bolso y cuesta apenas 6 euros. ¿Lo mejor? No es una paleta cualquiera. Fue desarrollada junto a Kate Moss, quien aporta ese toque cool británico a una fórmula práctica y efectiva. La promesa de la paleta es clara: esculpir, iluminar y dar color al rostro con naturalidad. Pero en la práctica, también ofrece versatilidad total: El bronceador es de tono neutro, sin subtono naranja, ideal para contorno sutil o efecto sunkissed. El iluminador tiene destello fino, nada glitter, que aporta ese glow elegante estilo Hailey Bieber. El rubor es rosa-melocotón universal, favorecedor en todo tipo de pieles, que da ese toque de vitalidad instantánea. Además, su textura sedosa y modulable permite trabajar las capas sin dejar manchones ni exceso de polvo. Se difumina fácil con brocha, esponja o incluso con los dedos si estás fuera de casa. Rimmel no es nuevo en el juego, pero esta paleta lleva meses en los primeros puestos de ventas de Amazon y es protagonista de muchos tutoriales en TikTok y YouTube. ¿La razón? Hace el trabajo de tres productos de lujo en un solo gesto. Muchas influencers la comparan con: La Filmstar Bronze & Glow de Charlotte Tilbury (pero 40 euros más barata). El Dior Backstage Glow Face Palette, por su efecto de segunda piel. O incluso con Fenty Beauty, en cuanto a practicidad y pigmentación. Además, en un contexto donde buscamos optimizar rutinas y espacio (bye neceser gigante), una paleta todo en uno tiene un valor emocional: es eficiente, compacta y libre de complicaciones. Por 6 euros, la Rimmel Sculpting Palette ofrece calidad, practicidad y versatilidad. Perfecta para principiantes, minimalistas, chicas que viajan o quienes buscan un glow con poco esfuerzo. No sustituye a productos de gama alta en textura extrema o larga duración tipo red carpet, pero para el día a día y looks de oficina o citas, es más que suficiente. Además, es un recordatorio de que el buen maquillaje no tiene por qué costar una fortuna. Porque al final, el estilo es lo que haces con lo que tienes, no lo que cuesta. @mundistyle","SPR_COMBO[es]La tendencia de “maquillaje sin maquillaje” sigue fuerte, pero con un giro: ahora no solo queremos lucir frescas, también estructuradas.

mov_C117CD8F1AAE5835A6446F122EC43ED4,"  Hotel Cipriani in Venice has unveiled a magnificent bar and a boutique by Dior as part of its seasonal reopening, alongside a sweeping renovation by architect Peter Marino. Olivia Palamountain reports Venice's Hotel Cipriani has launched an exclusive Dior bar as part of its 2025 season reopening, marking a new collaboration between the legendary hospitality brand and the French luxury fashion house. Il Bacaro Dior (open Tuesday to Sunday from 6.30pm to 11.30pm) takes in glorious views over St. Mark's basin and features rattan furniture offset by cushions upholstered in green toile de Jouy - a heritage printed cloth produced by Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf in the 18th century. To amplify the branded experience, guests can take archipelago excursions on boats bearing the Dior signature. Located moments from St Mark's Square via the hotel's private boat service, Hotel Cipriani sits on the tip of the island with panoramic views across the Venetian lagoon. The property, which became Belmond's first acquisition in 1976, features Venice's largest private swimming pool, the over-water Cip's Club restaurant and the Casanova wellness centre. Alongside the bar, the luxury fashion house has installed a Dioriviera boutique, selling a collection of branded resortwear. The boutique features art installations including a large bamboo mural by Korakot and a glass sculpture by Simone Crestani, alongside hand-made furniture by Italian manufacturer Bonacina. Also new for 2025 are a series of renovations by architect and interior designer Peter Marino, who has overseen the refined redesign of 13 rooms including two master suites designed as Venetian apartments. Marino's multi-phase renovation includes two master suites featuring dining rooms, libraries and salons with lagoon views, plus 11 suites and junior suites with private balconies overlooking the Casanova Gardens. The architect has maintained the beloved lobby whilst creating an adjacent double-height arrival experience. New lagoon experiences for the summer season include sunset tours and enhanced dining at the Michelin-starred Oro restaurant, led by Chef Yana Ghedini in collaboration with world-renowned chef Massimo Bottura. The Il Bacaro Dior bar and Dioriviera boutique represent the latest luxury brand partnership for the Belmond property, which has operated on Giudecca Island since 1958. Elsewhere this year, Dior has also been busy. In March 2025, The Royal Scotsman, A Belmond Train, collaborated with Dior to create its first wellness retreat on wheels, featuring 'mindful movement' classes and naturopathic menus.

Il Bacaro Dior (open Tuesday to Sunday from 6.30pm to 11.30pm) takes in glorious views over St. Mark's basin and features rattan furniture offset by cushions upholstered in green toile de Jouy - a heritage printed cloth produced by Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf in the 18th century. To amplify the branded experience, guests can take archipelago excursions on boats bearing the Dior signature. Located moments from St Mark's Square via the hotel's private boat service, Hotel Cipriani sits on the tip of the island with panoramic views across the Venetian lagoon. The property, which became Belmond's first acquisition in 1976, features Venice's largest private swimming pool, the over-water Cip's Club restaurant and the Casanova wellness centre. Alongside the bar, the luxury fashion house has installed a Dioriviera boutique, selling a collection of branded resortwear. The boutique features art installations including a large bamboo mural by Korakot and a glass sculpture by Simone Crestani, alongside hand-made furniture by Italian manufacturer Bonacina. Also new for 2025 are a series of renovations by architect and interior designer Peter Marino, who has overseen the refined redesign of 13 rooms including two master suites designed as Venetian apartments. Marino's multi-phase renovation includes two master suites featuring dining rooms, libraries and salons with lagoon views, plus 11 suites and junior suites with private balconies overlooking the Casanova Gardens. The architect has maintained the beloved lobby whilst creating an adjacent double-height arrival experience. New lagoon experiences for the summer season include sunset tours and enhanced dining at the Michelin-starred Oro restaurant, led by Chef Yana Ghedini in collaboration with world-renowned chef Massimo Bottura. The Il Bacaro Dior bar and Dioriviera boutique represent the latest luxury brand partnership for the Belmond property, which has operated on Giudecca Island since 1958. Elsewhere this year, Dior has also been busy. In March 2025, The Royal Scotsman, A Belmond Train, collaborated with Dior to create its first wellness retreat on wheels, featuring 'mindful movement' classes and naturopathic menus.

We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Once again, at this year's Wimbledon tournament, the only thing distracting from the tennis is the court-side style. “Wimbledon has turned the stands into a catwalk, and I am here for it,” says model and presenter Leomie Anderson, who is covering Wimbledon as Clearpay's fashion expert this season. If recent years saw guests erring on the side of safe – quiet luxury defined by demure dresses, boxy blazers and the occasional fascinator – 2025 has shifted gear. “There's a real shift happening,” Anderson explains, “people used to play it safe with blazers, midi dresses, the usual suspects. But this year, the crowd is serving. It's like everyone got the memo that Wimbledon is just as much a style moment as it is a sport.” And the stats back her up. Broderie anglaise is booming – with maxi dresses up 147%, skirts up 33% – hats are having a high-fashion renaissance with floppy styles up 99%, and butter-yellow is surging according to Clearpay. The best celebrity looks managed to balance their personality with a playful nod to the tournament's stereotypes – from Wimbledon whites to strawberries and cream. “There's something powerful about its simplicity, the traditions – the setting, the subtlety,” says Anderson. “People know they have to bring their A-game.” Here are some of the best-dressed celebrities at the tournament so far and how they aced Wimbledon style. Olivia Rodrigo A masterstroke in edging up tradition, singer Olivia Rodrigo, 22, wore a red gingham shirt dress by Ralph Lauren from the spring/summer 2000 archive – a playful nod to Wimbledon's iconic strawberries and cream. Her boyfriend, Louis Partridge, 22, coordinated in a red striped tie and navy blazer. Following her headlining performance at Glastonbury Festival on Sunday, Rodrigo managed to nail the elusive balance of British heritage and Gen Z irreverence. Anna and Michael Murray Also sticking to Wimble classics was retail tycoon and CEO of Frasers Group, Michael Murray, who went traditional in a linen white suit, a cream Panama and brown suede loafers. His wife Anna wore the print of the season in a tulle black and white polka dot midi dress, with black suede pumps and black leather Birkin. Cate Blanchett Actress Cate Blanchett, 56, stood out on Centre Court in a pearlescent Prince of Wales check suit by Giorgio Armani. Sharply tailored but soft in palette, it was a classic Blanchett power move, turning heads without the noise. “Cate's baby blue tartan suit was effortless and elegant,” Anderson puts it, “that classic tailoring is signature Cate cool.” Leslie Mann Wimbledon whites are a fail-safe style to sport year after year. While they run the risk of becoming repetitive and – dare I say – boring; when styled right with interesting cuts, whites can be as elegant as ever. Actress Leslie Mann, 53, appeared on day three in an ivory Dior bar jacket and delicate lace skirt. The look was reminiscent of the Princess of Wales recent Self Portrait ensemble at the Order of the Garter in June. David Beckham One thing more certain than spotting a cream Panama hat in the Wimbledon stands is spotting David Beckham. The 50-year-old former footballer once again brought off-court elegance in a cream silk-linen suit from his own Boss collaboration, finished with a chocolate brown tie. The only fashion blunder was plaster cast on his right arm – though even that couldn't detract from his summer suiting credentials. Dominic Cooper Unlike Beckham, 47 year-old actor Dominic Cooper opted out of the classic Wimbledon look and sported a bright powder blue suit with matching trainers. “I'm seeing bold colour choices […] and people leaning into what makes their style unique,” says Anderson of the look. Cooper reminded us that co-ordination doesn't have to mean stiff – and tonal can be a statement when done right. Tom Daley Dusky teal was Olympic diver Tom Daley's shade of choice – cool and contemporary and a refreshing break from Wimbledon white. Daley, 31, paired the Paul Smith suit with a Christian Louboutin clutch and a Chopard watch. Judy Murray Mother to former Wimbledon champion Sir Andy Murray, Judy Murray chose a sunshine-yellow Me+Em dress with white platform trainers. The cheerful dress was bang on trend, with butter yellow emerging as the summer's sleeper hit....","Your support helps us to tell the story From reproductive rights to climate change to Big Tech, The Independent is on the ground when the story is developing.

mov_B6B73E99B398B687DFCEE498EA2E43D0,"  While the world's top tennis players battle it out on the hallowed courts of Wimbledon, it's the increasingly bold fashion statements from the stands that are truly serving up a spectacle this year. The annual tournament, long associated with understated elegance, appears to have transformed its spectator areas into an unexpected runway. ""Wimbledon has turned the stands into a catwalk, and I am here for it,"" declares model and presenter Leomie Anderson, who is covering the event as Clearpay's fashion expert this season. Her observation highlights a significant shift from recent years, which saw guests largely adhering to a ""quiet luxury"" aesthetic defined by demure dresses, boxy blazers, and the occasional fascinator. “There's a real shift happening,” Anderson says. “People used to play it safe with blazers, midi dresses, the usual suspects. But this year, the crowd is serving. It's like everyone got the memo that Wimbledon is just as much a style moment as it is a sport.” This sartorial revolution is backed by compelling data from Clearpay. Broderie anglaise, a delicate embroidered fabric, is experiencing a significant boom, with maxi dresses in the style seeing a 147 per cent increase and skirts up by 33 per cent. Hats are also enjoying a high-fashion renaissance, with floppy styles surging by 99 per cent. Adding a splash of colour to the courtside scene, butter-yellow has emerged as a dominant trend, according to the payment platform. The best celebrity looks managed to balance the wearer's personality with a playful nod to the tournament's stereotypes – from Wimbledon whites to strawberries and cream. “There's something powerful about its simplicity, the traditions – the setting, the subtlety,” says Anderson. “People know they have to bring their A-game.” Here are some of the best-dressed celebrities at the tournament so far and how they aced Wimbledon style. Olivia Rodrigo A masterstroke in edging up tradition, singer Olivia Rodrigo, 22, wore a red gingham shirt dress by Ralph Lauren from the spring/summer 2000 archive – a playful nod to Wimbledon's iconic strawberries and cream. Her boyfriend, Louis Partridge, 22, coordinated in a red striped tie and navy blazer. Following her headlining performance at Glastonbury Festival on Sunday, Rodrigo managed to nail the elusive balance of British heritage and Gen Z irreverence. Anna and Michael Murray Also sticking to Wimble classics was the retail tycoon and CEO of Frasers Group, Michael Murray, who went traditional in a linen white suit, a cream Panama and brown suede loafers. His wife Anna wore the print of the season in a tulle black and white polka dot midi dress, with black suede pumps and black leather Birkin. Cate Blanchett Actress Cate Blanchett, 56, stood out on Centre Court in a pearlescent Prince of Wales check suit by Giorgio Armani. Sharply tailored but soft in palette, it was a classic Blanchett power move, turning heads without the noise. “Cate's baby blue tartan suit was effortless and elegant,” Anderson puts it, “that classic tailoring is signature Cate cool.” Leslie Mann Wimbledon whites are a fail-safe style to sport year after year. While they run the risk of becoming repetitive and – dare I say – boring; when styled right with interesting cuts, whites can be as elegant as ever. Actor Leslie Mann, 53, appeared on day three in an ivory Dior bar jacket and delicate lace skirt. The look was reminiscent of the Princess of Wales' recent Self Portrait ensemble at the Order of the Garter in June. David Beckham One thing more certain than spotting a cream Panama hat in the Wimbledon stands is spotting David Beckham. The 50-year-old former footballer once again brought off-court elegance in a cream silk-linen suit from his own Boss collaboration, finished with a chocolate brown tie. The only fashion blunder was a plaster cast on his right arm – though even that couldn't detract from his summer suiting credentials. Dominic Cooper Unlike Beckham, 47 year-old actor Dominic Cooper opted out of the classic Wimbledon look and sported a bright powder blue suit with matching trainers. “I'm seeing bold colour choices […] and people leaning into what makes their style unique,” says Anderson of the look. Cooper reminded us that co-ordination doesn't have to mean stiff – and tonal can be a statement when done right. Tom Daley Dusky teal was Olympic diver Tom Daley's shade of choice – cool and contemporary and a refreshing break from Wimbledon white. Daley, 31, paired the Paul Smith suit with a Christian Louboutin clutch and a Chopard watch. Judy Murray Judy Murray, the mother former Wimbledon champion Sir Andy Murray, chose a sunshine-yellow Me+Em dress with white platform trainers. The cheerful dress was bang on trend, with butter yellow emerging as the summer's sleeper hit. Murray, 65, wasn't the only celebrity to sport the shade. “[Actor] Omari Douglas's all-yellow outfit too … is exactly the kind of energy the tournament needs,” says Anderson.

urn:li:ugcPost:7346540675452043265,"  Officially an HEC Alumna I am proud to share that I have recently graduated from the MSc in Marketing at HEC Paris! From the very first day, we were immersed in a culture of excellence. We were encouraged by industry leaders and inspiring speakers to think boldly, communicate with purpose, and push the boundaries of what we believed possible. Throughout the program, I had the opportunity to work on real-world projects with some of the most influential names in the industry. We developed a 360° strategy for L'Oréal  La Roche-Posay Laboratoire Dermatologique, created a new fragrance concept for Parfums Christian Dior, reimagined Veepee's approach to Gen Z, crafted a sustainability narrative for Amazon  in collaboration with DDB  and tackled a strategic consulting case with McKinsey & Company, among others. We also attended thought-provoking conferences, including a particularly memorable session with Marc Chaya, CEO and Co-founder of Maison Francis Kurkdjian, which left a lasting impression on me. Beyond the projects and events, I explored new fields, refined critical skills, and experienced meaningful personal and professional growth. This was made possible thanks to the dedication of our professors and the collaboration of brilliant classmates who made the experience truly exceptional.

From the very first day, we were immersed in a culture of excellence. We were encouraged by industry leaders and inspiring speakers to think boldly, communicate with purpose, and push the boundaries of what we believed possible. Throughout the program, I had the opportunity to work on real-world projects with some of the most influential names in the industry. We developed a 360° strategy for L'Oréal La Roche-Posay Laboratoire Dermatologique, created a new fragrance concept for Parfums Christian Dior, reimagined Veepee's approach to Gen Z, crafted a sustainability narrative for Amazon in collaboration with DDB and tackled a strategic consulting case with McKinsey & Company, among others. We also attended thought-provoking conferences, including a particularly memorable session with Marc Chaya, CEO and Co-founder of Maison Francis Kurkdjian, which left a lasting impression on me. Beyond the projects and events, I explored new fields, refined critical skills, and experienced meaningful personal and professional growth. This was made possible thanks to the dedication of our professors and the collaboration of brilliant classmates who made the experience truly exceptional.

mov_0AE0CD3CA2DCF34CA5018FF6B22A4B2E,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Abbey Clancy's daughter Sophia showed she has taken after her model mother as she joined her famous family and footballer father Peter Crouch at the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club for day four of Wimbledon on Thursday. The daughter to the famous couple, 14, showed off her resemblance to her mother as she was seen topping up her lip gloss in the crowd. She joined Abbey, 39, and Peter, 44, who looked happier than ever and packed on the PDA with a kiss while sat in Centre Court, as she stepped out in an all white ensemble. For the outing, Sophie put on a very glamorous display as she toted her belongings around in a black leather Miu Miu bag. It appears that she also has her mother's eye for designer accessories, as she accessorised with four Christian Dior cloth bracelets, each worth a whopping £250. To finish her sporting day outfit, Sophia was seen wearing false eyelashes as she applied a layer of Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip gloss. Meanwhile Abbey - who is also a mother to Liberty, nine, Johnny, seven, and Jack, five - looked incredible for the outing as she wore a yellow striped suit. Liverpool football legend Peter, looked handsome as he attended the event in a casual blue shirt. Abbey has had a highly successful modelling career, while she's also branched out into presenting, novel writing and even won Strictly Come Dancing back in 2013. And Sophia has taken nepotism in her stride as she made her modelling debut aged eight when she joined Abbey for a Lipsy shoot. Sophia has reportedly had 'loads of offers' already from agencies as she is being dubbed the 'next Lila Moss' A source told Heat World: 'Sophia is getting lots of offers from modelling agencies. They see her as the next big thing, thanks to her looking like Abbey and having Pete's height. 'She has already done campaigns with her mum, but now big-name agencies are desperate to sign her and turn her into the next Lila Moss.' Centre Court spectators will be watching Jack Draper compete against 2017 Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic and Dan Evans takes on Novak Djokovic. Draper, the current world No4, takes on 2017 Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic this afternoon as he looks to progress past the second round for the first time at SW19. World number one Jannik Sinner is also back in the spotlight, up against Aleksandar Vukic, whilst Iga Swiatek plays Caty McNally in the other Centre Court match. Judy Murray has opened up on the secrets of the Royal Box at Wimbledon as celebrity guests continue to flood into Wimbledon. While there are 18 Championship grass courts at SW19, all eyes are often on the historic Centre Court, which plays host to the best stars the sport has to offer as they compete for glory. Centre Court boasts nearly 15,000 seats, meaning lucky punters can be seen cheering on their favourites, and are joined by guests in the Royal Box at around lunchtime each day. So far this week, the likes of John Cena, Thomas Tuchel and Olivia Rodrigo have all been present, with all three part of a star-studded line-up in the Box on Wednesday. On Tuesday Judy, renown for her coaching work in the sport and her support for tennis-playing sons Andy and Jamie, made an appearance. Before her trip, she opened up on what it is like in the Royal Box on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show with The National Lottery on Virgin Radio UK. 'Royal Boxing should be a verb, shouldn't it?' she said.' It should be a summer verb.' She added: 'Well, you arrive usually around 11.30, so you go upstairs, they have a champagne reception, then you go in for lunch and you could be sitting beside absolutely anybody at lunch. There's no seating plan, it's just as you go into the room. 'It's in the clubhouse of the All England Club, and the first year that I went I took my mum, of course, and we sat with Jack Nicklaus. I sat with a few years ago a lady who was the first female Spitfire pilot. I mean it's just you could be with absolutely anybody and the stories are fascinating. 'It's really tough when the sun comes round because there's no escape. 'It's actually I think worse for the guys because they have to wear a jacket and tie and they're not allowed to take the jacket off unless the royalty in the box takes their jacket off first. That's the protocol.'","Have YOU got a story?

mov_486D9E815810C5AB51AE53BFBCE2AA9E,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Somos referencia obligada en Tlaxcala. Muchas personas usan el término “perfume” para referirse a cualquier fragancia, pero no todas tienen la misma concentración ni duración. Las diferencias entre un perfume, un eau de parfum y un eau de toilette no solo radican en su nombre, sino también en su composición, intensidad y uso recomendado. Conocer estas variaciones es clave para elegir la opción más adecuada según el estilo de vida, el clima y el presupuesto. En el mercado mexicano, existe una amplia oferta que incluye desde marcas internacionales de alta gama hasta opciones accesibles y funcionales. Cada formato tiene sus ventajas dependiendo del contexto: si se busca una fragancia duradera para un evento especial, o algo más fresco y liviano para el día a día. Comprender estas diferencias ayuda a evitar errores comunes, cómo comprar una fragancia demasiado intensa para el uso diario. Este artículo detalla las particularidades de cada tipo de producto, presenta ejemplos representativos y ofrece recomendaciones prácticas para encontrar la fragancia ideal, ya sea de firmas de lujo o de marcas populares como los perfumes Aeropostale, Calvin Klein, Zara o Tous. Diferencias fundamentales entre las concentraciones Cada tipo de fragancia tiene una formulación distinta que influye directamente en su duración y proyección. ¿Qué es un perfume? El perfume o extrait de parfum es el formato más concentrado. Su contenido de aceites esenciales suele estar entre el 20 % y el 30 %, lo que le confiere una duración prolongada, a veces superior a 12 horas en la piel. Este tipo de fragancia es más costosa, pero también más persistente y sofisticada. Ejemplos comunes de perfumes concentrados incluyen Chanel No. 5 Extrait, Dior J'adore L'Absolu o Amouage Interlude Woman. Por su intensidad, se recomienda aplicarlos con moderación y reservarlos para eventos especiales o climas fríos, donde pueden desplegar todo su potencial sin resultar abrumadores. ¿Qué es un eau de parfum? El eau de parfum (EDP) es uno de los formatos más populares por su equilibrio entre duración y precio. Su concentración oscila entre el 15 % y el 20 %, lo que permite una fijación duradera de 6 a 8 horas, dependiendo del tipo de piel y las condiciones ambientales. Marcas como Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Carolina Herrera Good Girl, Montblanc Signature o los perfumes Aeropostale en su versión EDP son buenos ejemplos de esta categoría. Estas fragancias son ideales para el uso diario en ambientes cerrados o para quienes desean un aroma que permanezca durante toda la jornada. ¿Qué es un eau de toilette? El eau de toilette (EDT) contiene entre un 5 % y un 15 % de aceites aromáticos. Esto la convierte en una opción más ligera, con una duración que va de 3 a 5 horas. Es perfecta para climas cálidos, momentos casuales o como fragancia de reaplicación a lo largo del día. Algunos EDT populares son CK One, Versace Pour Femme Dylan Blue, Tous Touch o Light Blue de Dolce & Gabbana en su versión ligera. Son recomendables para quienes prefieren aromas sutiles y frescos que no invadan el espacio personal. Aplicaciones prácticas según el estilo de vida Cada formato responde a un tipo de uso diferente, según la ocasión y la rutina personal. Fragancias para el trabajo y el día a día Para entornos laborales o actividades cotidianas, el eau de toilette suele ser la mejor elección. Su ligereza evita que el aroma resulte molesto para los demás, y su frescura aporta una sensación de limpieza. También es común reaplicar este tipo de fragancia a lo largo del día sin saturar. Marcas como Zara, Burberry Weekend, Benetton Colors, o los perfumes Aeropostale presentan opciones adecuadas para este perfil de uso, especialmente en oficinas o ambientes escolares. Fragancias para eventos especiales Cuando se necesita una fragancia más notoria y duradera, como en bodas, cenas o reuniones nocturnas, lo ideal es optar por un perfume o un buen eau de parfum. Estas versiones logran mayor permanencia y proyección, creando una estela más distintiva. Algunas recomendaciones incluyen Lancome La Vie Est Belle, Tom Ford Black Orchid, Mugler Alien o Elie Saab Le Parfum. Estos productos se comportan bien en pieles secas o en climas templados. Cómo identificar el tipo de concentración Es clave revisar la etiqueta y los detalles del envase antes de comprar una fragancia. Qué buscar en la botella o caja Los productos suelen indicar claramente si se trata de un perfume, eau de parfum o eau de toilette. Estas leyendas aparecen junto al nombre de la fragancia, por lo general en francés. En caso de duda, también se puede consultar el porcentaje de concentración en la lista de ingredientes. Además, algunas marcas ofrecen el mismo aroma en diferentes concentraciones. Por ejemplo, Chanel Coco Mademoiselle tiene versiones tanto EDP cómo EDT, cada una con una estructura olfativa ligeramente distinta, pero fiel al ADN del perfume. Consideraciones al comprar en línea Cuando se adquiere una fragancia por internet, especialmente en tiendas mexicanas como Liverpool, Sears, Sanborns o Amazon México, es fundamental verificar la descripción del producto....","SPR_COMBO[es]Somos referencia obligada en Tlaxcala.

L'incident, révélé après que Vogue a profilé la somptueuse garde-robe de la mariée, a été confirmée par la suite par le -, qui a rapporté que Sánchez a décrit la robe comme «celle qui s'est échappée» et ne sait toujours pas où elle s'est terminée. Une garde-robe faite pour un mariage d'une semaine L'ancien ancre de télévision et pilote d'hélicoptère a commandé 27 robes pour les célébrations de mariage, qui se sont déroulées sur plusieurs jours fin juin sur l'île de Majorque. Bien que le couple s'est officiellement marié lors d'une cérémonie privée à bord de 394 millions de livres sterling de Bezos (500 millions de dollars) Yacht Koru, les festivités ont duré plusieurs emplacements et thèmes. Sánchez aurait travaillé avec des maisons de mode de renommée mondiale, notamment Dolce & Gabbana, Dior, Valentino et Schiaparelli. Chaque look a été conçu pour correspondre à une partie spécifique de la célébration, des dîners avant le mariage aux rassemblements de yachts post-cérémonie. Mais malgré une planification méticuleuse, l'une des robes n'est jamais arrivée. La robe manquante a disparu en transit. Bien que Sánchez n'ait pas identifié le designer, elle l'a appelé «un mystère» et a dit: «Peut-être que ce n'était pas censé être». L'absence n'a pas fait dérailler les célébrations mais a ajouté une tournure inattendue à ce qui était autrement une affaire étroitement chorégraphiée. Une liste d'invités et un budget pour correspondre Le mariage, qui a eu lieu le week-end du 22 juin 2025, était tout sauf petit. Le coût global aurait dépassé 15,7 millions de livres sterling (20 millions de dollars), couvrant tout, de la restauration de luxe au transport et à la sécurité des jets privés. Les invités comprenaient un who's who de la célébrité et de la royauté du monde technologique. Barbra Streisand, Oprah Winfrey, Kris Jenner et Bill Gates auraient tous été présents. Les participants ont été transportés entre les événements via l'hélicoptère, les convois de SUV privés et la flotte personnelle de Bezos. Le couple a loué un domaine du XVIe siècle dans les montagnes de Deià et a accueilli plusieurs rassemblements en plus de la cérémonie elle-même. Les installations florales, les menus sur mesure et la vaisselle des concepteurs auraient fait partie de l'expérience. Malgré sa taille, Sánchez a décrit le mariage dans son interview Vogue comme «intime et sacrée», une phrase qui a attiré des réactions mitigées en ligne. Une robe de mariée devient un sujet de discussion La nouvelle de la robe manquante, bien que mineure dans le contexte d'un événement aussi massif, est rapidement devenue symbolique de l'échelle et de l'excès entourant la célébration. La garde-robe de 27-durée de Sánchez, combinée à la liste des invités somptueuses et à un cadre exotique, a été considéré par certains comme emblématique de l'extravagance milliardaire. Les commentaires en ligne allaient de l'envie légère aux critiques plus nettes. Certains utilisateurs de médias sociaux ont décrit la situation comme un «problème milliardaire à laquelle personne d'autre ne pouvait se rapporter», tandis que d'autres se sont concentrés sur la logistique du stockage et du transport d'un nombre aussi élevé de robes de couture pour un week-end. Sánchez, cependant, semblait imperturbable. Sa citation, «Peut-être que ce n'était pas censé être», livrée en riant, semblait résumer son attitude: élégante mais non botrée. Un mariage fait pour se souvenir Qu'il s'agisse du cadre de superyacht, de la garde-robe rotative ou de la robe de designer manquante, le mariage Bezos – Sánchez a déjà cimenté sa place dans les titres culturels de 2025. Le couple, fiancé depuis 2023, est au centre de la fascination publique depuis des années, non seulement pour leur richesse mais aussi pour leur style de vie très visible et leurs efforts philanthropiques. Et tandis que la plupart des mariages ont un hoquet ou deux, dans celui-ci, une robe manquante pourrait être le détail le plus sur la marque de tous.","SPR_COMBO[fr]L'une des robes de mariée personnalisées de Lauren Sánchez a disparu en route vers Majorque, en Espagne, quelques jours avant son mariage extravagant de juin avec le fondateur d'Amazon Jeff Bezos, selon les rapports publiés cette semaine.

The passion, knowledge, and honest feedback here really guided me through my fragrance journey. In the last 4 months, I went all in tried over 150+ decants, visited a few local perfumeries, and explored and owned tons of perfume oils beyond what I'm sharing in this post. After a lot of research (and a bit of obsession), I ended up collecting these fragrances, and let's just say… it became quite the addiction! That said, I've decided to hit pause and not buy any more fragrances for the rest of the year (with one exception that might arrive in the next couple of days). I'll still be around and happy to help anyone here however I can. Thanks again for being such a great part of this journey! **Note**: I am not an expert , I trust my nose more than reviews, please do research or test fragrances before you buy, I am from Middle east / Asia English is not my native language, I apologize in advance for any mistakes i try to explain this in my words without using any AI or correction tool. I am reviewing all fragrances after giving them time to mature. From Top Left to Right: 1. **Icon by Dunhill**: Really Good citrusy, Aromatic and floral scent. A good alternative for those who don't like sweet or overly citrusy scents for summer. 2. **1 Million Prive:** The most complimented one on my list, absolutely amazing winter scent with sweet and tobacco notes; I failed to find anything that can beat that fragrance. 3. **1 Million Elixir:** Very sweet and creamy vanilla with colorful floral tones, especially on the dry down. Lasts a long time and projection is strong. **4. **   **Jasoor:** Clone of VUBIR Coral Fantasy Long Lasting with Good projection, Very Versatile for year-round wear except very hot evenings. **5. **   **Asad Bourbon:** Clone that covers VUBIR Intense, Most Wanted and Stronger with you. Smells cozy and rich. Feels confident and warm. **6. **   **Khamrah :** Amazing Scent, Sweet,  Warm , Cozy with Vanilla and amber. 7. **Khamrah Dukhan:** I tried Liquid Burn, and to my nose, it smells quite similar that same warm, spicy DNA. But Khamrah Dukhan was much cheaper, so I went for it. It's incredibly long-lasting and feels like a spicier, less sweet version of Khamrah. If the sweetness in the original Khamrah isn't your thing, this might be a better fit. Honestly, it's underrated and didn't get the recognition it deserves from early buyers or reviewers. This one needs more attention, it's a hidden gem. 8. **Alpine Homme Sport**: Clone of Allure Homme Sport, as a Sporty scent both last 4-5 hours, and it's enough for a sports session, very good gym scent. 9. **CDN Precieux:** Clone of Aventus Absolu with Twist, Great performance and quality scent better and smoother when compared with Supremacy CE but costs more and feel more expensive **10. ** **Mont Blanc Starwalker:** absolute masterpiece a good night time / bedtime scent. Calming and relaxing, Hyped for a reason very unique scent. **11. ** **Dunhill Desire for a man:** Apple, Citrus and Rose based scent, classic cheap summer scent suitable for any age. 12. **L'Homme by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of L'Homme Lacoste, long lasting, sweet, citrusy fresh scent. FD is a small local perfumery in my area. 13. **L'Homme Intense by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of Dior Homme Intense, Dior Homme intense clones were mostly sold out and its hard to get them in my country so i visited a local perfumery where they had this clone its using same french oils used by other clone houses. I tried it it was very long lasting so i bought the bottle, during testing it last 12+ hours on my skin. 14....","Hey everyone!

Or when you're obsessed with the quirky monster doll, Labubu, that everyone on social media seems to own? For some, the answer is simple: don't buy it. But for others - especially those stubborn, brand-loving souls - Indian markets have found a workaround. If you can't get the first copy, just buy the fifth one. And no, these aren't dupes with witty name changes or altered packaging. These are full-blown counterfeits: same branding, identical packaging, but at a mere fraction of the price. We took a deep dive into these murky online markets to find out what's being sold, how they are being sold, and more importantly, why so many people are buying them. But before we unpack all that, let's rewind a bit. The Rise Of India's Counterfeit Culture Counterfeit goods aren't new in India. They've existed in various forms for decades. When globalisation opened the floodgates to international brands, a majority of Indians found themselves unable to afford the real thing. The demand was high, but supply (at least the genuine kind) was out of reach. Naturally, the market responded in its own cheeky way. Think of places like D'manoj Pizza knocking off Domino's. Even when Domino's caught wind of the viral video of their doppelganger, their response was just as cheeky: ""Yahan ka address milega? (Can we get the address?)"" (Not a copyright claim) Today, that spirit has spilled across industries, from fast food to fashion to beauty. Markets like Sarojini Nagar in Delhi, Esplanade in Kolkata and Linking Road in Mumbai are prime examples, brimming with off-brand versions of luxury items. These IRL knock-offs often tweak a letter here, a logo there, or at least get the shade of lipstick slightly off. For beauty products though, the compromises run deeper - especially when it comes to ingredients and safety. But the game has changed online. Unlike the local bazaar, where, you know you're buying a knock-off, e-commerce marketplaces and social media are now peddling products that look identical to the original. Meesho, Facebook Marketplace, Amazon, Instagram... everyone is on it, and everyone is in on it. How These Fake Markets Operate Meesho Meesho is notorious (and simultaneously beloved) for offering bargain-basement prices. The brand claims this is possible because it eliminates middlemen, connects resellers directly to manufacturers, and focuses on lesser-known brands. But this has created the perfect breeding ground for fake products - especially viral beauty items. Take Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip treatment, for instance. Not officially available in India, but somehow being sold on Meesho for less than Rs 500. We even found fake Dior and Gisou lip oils, sold in nearly identical packaging but with slightly altered names. Facebook Marketplace It might not be trending in urban Gen Z circles, but Facebook Marketplace (FMP) is still massive. With over a billion global users shopping every month, it's a hotspot for everything from houseplants to handbags - and now, counterfeit beauty products in India. It's not just about fake luxury either. Some sellers offer bizarrely cheap prices for products that shouldn't even be in India, let alone available at that price. The sheer scale of the platform makes it easy for scamsters to thrive with little scrutiny. Instagram Instagram, Meta's glamorous baby, has become a thriving hub for small business sellers, even in India. Unfortunately, many of them are hawking knock-off makeup and skincare products via Reels. Some don't even bother to change the names-they rely on flashy visuals and discounted prices to hook unsuspecting users. The perfume industry is especially saturated with counterfeit sellers offering half-price on these bottles that may look legit but aren't even close.

In total, Dior achieved more than a billion views on social media, thanks to a communication campaign across 21 platforms in the run-up and aftermath of the June 27 display during men's fashion week in Paris. “The livestream of the show alone attracted over 200 million views, as did the two teaser videos featuring world football champion Kylian Mbappé,” according to Dior, sharing preliminary data with WWD. The full-court press around the show commenced with Andy Warhol's Polaroid of artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. Dior revealed the campaign first via an Instagram Story Close Friends activation, leaking the images to select editors and talents — whom Dior added to the Close Friends feature on Instagram. Before the show, whose opening look was a take on the Bar jacket paired with voluminously pleated cargo shorts, Dior broadcast a film depicting “The White Lotus” actor Sam Nivola in Versailles and guests — including Robert Pattinson — getting ready in their hotel rooms before arriving at the venue. As additional content, Dior released a podcast with Karen Binns and an audiobook based on the founding couturier's autobiography “Christian Dior et Moi,” read in French by Louis Garrel, who also attended the show.

Според италианското издание Corriere della Sera, тоалет от впечатляващата сватбена колекция на Санчес липсва. Макар сред местните да се шушука, че роклята може да е открадната, до момента няма подаден сигнал или започнато разследване по случая. Все още не е ясно коя точно от зашеметяващите рокли на Санчес се е „изпарила“, но според Daily Mail най-ценната ѝ рокля – уникалната дантелена Dolce & Gabbana, с която тя мина под венчило, е в безопасност. Този впечатляващ модел е вдъхновен от визията на София Лорен в култовия филм ""Houseboat"" от 1958 г., където тя се омъжва за Кари Грант. Роклята на Санчес впечатли с дълги ръкави, корсетен силует, висока яка и типична „русалка“ пола. Отпред бяха зашити 180 копчета – стилно подчертаване на уникалния дизайн.

In a notice posted on its website, Louis Vuitton Korea informed customers that a third-party entity temporarily accessed the company's systems on June 8 and leaked some customer information, reports Yonhap news agency. The company said it learnt of the incident on Wednesday. The compromised data may include customer names, contact details and additional information provided by customers, Louis Vuitton said, but stressed that no financial data, such as passwords and credit card numbers, was affected. The incident is the latest in a string of high-profile data leaks in the luxury sector in South Korea this year. In May, Dior apologised after discovering a data breach incident that occurred in January. Tiffany also revealed in May that it had suffered a breach in April.

The coat, which was part of Jonathan Anderson's debut collection as the creative director for both menswear and womenswear at Dior, featured traditional Indian Mukaish embroidery. Despite its heritage and craftsmanship, Anderson has reportedly failed to acknowledge these artisans' contributions. Craftsmanship details Coat made by 12 artisans over 34 days Fashion commentator Hanan Besnovic aka ideservecouture on Instagram highlighted why the coat was so expensive. The coat, unveiled at Paris Fashion Week on June 27, was made by 12 artisans over a period of 34 days. The embroidery technique used is called Mukaish or Badla work, which originated in the Awadh region of Lucknow. This traditional Indian embroidery involves using thin metal wires (badla) to create intricate designs on fabric without any thread or glue.

Според италианското издание ""Кориере дела Сера"", тоалет от впечатляващата сватбена колекция на Санчес липсва. Макар сред местните да се шушука, че роклята може да е открадната, до момента няма подаден сигнал или започнато разследване по случая. Все още не е ясно коя точно от зашеметяващите рокли на Санчес се е „изпарила“, но според ""Дейли Мейл"" най-ценната ѝ рокля – уникалната дантелена Dolce & Gabbana, с която тя мина под венчило, е в безопасност. Този впечатляващ модел е вдъхновен от визията на София Лорен в култовия филм ""Houseboat"" от 1958 г., където тя се омъжва за Кари Грант. Роклята на Санчес впечатли с дълги ръкави, корсетен силует, висока яка и типична „русалка“ пола. Отпред бяха зашити 180 копчета – стилно подчертаване на уникалния дизайн. ""Първоначално исках нещо модерно, изчистено и секси, а накрая се спрях на тоалет, който носи духа на момента и показва къде съм днес. Аз съм различна жена от тази преди пет години“, сподели новата госпожа Безос пред Vogue.

mov_85B88F3879C3CC38867E972D4AA36CAD,"  Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride. While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb - without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries, working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand - one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow, or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets it as a gown, be happy. One would be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires, but it has only two global consumer brands. Having a large home market - by volume, not value - our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts - a net $90 bn deficit. It doesn't help that India's GI regulation is the weakest form of 'sui-generis protection mechanism', as Akriti and Pinaki Ghosh wrote in 2024 in 'Challenges in the Utilization of GI Registration for Capitalizing GI Products', in Journal of Intellectual Property Rights. Lack of enforceability dilutes 'transparency, fairness, effectiveness, and accountability - pillars of good governance', they argue. Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous statutory drafting, sloppy marketing and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations to spur the ages- old artisanship and economically uplift kolhapuri makers. None of the large Indian business groups - those even in fashion or retail - have come forward yet to safeguard their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled sarees as part of a sustainability project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration of iconic monuments and archaeological sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship. From sarees to shoes, music to movies, we hardly prize our handlooms or history, artisans or antiquities. We do not appreciate our own, till the world appreciates it. Oddly enough, while we seek outside validation, we also get easily enraged. Satyajit Ray was 'extremely discouraged' by the initial reception of Pather Panchali in India, Kolkata included. International acclaim, starting with Best Human Document Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, turned the tide. It took America-born Sally Holkar to revive Maheshwari weaves, or John Bissell to create a brand for our fabrics in Fabindia. Delhi-based Scot William Dalrymple has taken India's primordial gift for myth and narrative to make scholarship in history accessible. While the renaissance of modern Indian art owes much to Japanese businessman Masanori Fukuoka. Unless we own, defend and develop our own value chains, we shall continue to let our misplaced chauvinism get the better of us. The devil doesn't just wear Prada.","Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride.

FA0724F511A32E4DC29B070B1282CCB9,"  Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride. While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb — without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries,   working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch   and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand — one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary   topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western   couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow,   or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri   has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets   it as a gown, be happy. One would   be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires,   but it has only two global consumer   brands. Having a large home market — by volume, not value — our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts   — a net $90 bn deficit. It doesn't help that India's GI regulation   is the weakest form of 'sui-generis   protection mechanism', as Akriti and Pinaki Ghosh wrote in 2024 in 'Challenges in the Utilization of GI Registration for Capitalizing GI Products',   in Journal of Intellectual Property   Rights. Lack of enforceability dilutes 'transparency, fairness, effectiveness,   and accountability — pillars of good governance', they argue. Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single   malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous   statutory drafting, sloppy marketing   and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative   zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism   of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace   and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations   to spur the ages old   artisanship and economically   uplift kolhapuri   makers. None of the large Indian business groups — those even in fashion or retail — have come forward yet to safeguard   their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative   process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled   sarees as part of a sustainability   project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration   of iconic monuments and archaeological   sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve   or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship. From sarees to shoes, music to movies, we hardly prize our handlooms or history, artisans or antiquities. We do not appreciate our own, till the world appreciates it. Oddly enough, while we seek outside validation, we also get easily enraged. Satyajit Ray was 'extremely discouraged'   by the initial reception of Pather Panchali in India, Kolkata included. International acclaim, starting with Best Human Document Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, turned the tide. It took America-born Sally Holkar   to revive Maheshwari weaves, or John Bissell to create a brand for our fabrics in Fabindia. Delhi-based Scot William Dalrymple has taken India's primordial gift for myth and narrative to make scholarship   in history accessible. While the renaissance of modern Indian art owes much to Japanese businessman Masanori Fukuoka. Unless we own, defend and develop our own value chains, we shall continue   to let our misplaced chauvinism get the better of us. The devil doesn't just wear Prada. arijit.barman@timesofindia.com","Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride.

96BC2D18B64724DEB9F8F603B6E69E78,"  Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride. While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb — without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries,   working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch   and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand — one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary   topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western   couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow,   or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri   has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets   it as a gown, be happy. One would   be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires,   but it has only two global consumer   brands. Having a large home market — by volume, not value — our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts   — a net $90 bn deficit.

Louis Vuitton、Chanel、Dior、Cartier、Hermès、YSL、Givenchy……
有没有发现，它们几乎都来自——法国‼️
这些品牌，构成了魅力法兰西🇫🇷的标志。 👑 一切从“太阳王”路易十四开始…
法国的奢侈品文化并非偶然，而是从王权时代就被“刻进DNA”。 17世纪，路易十四一边打造凡尔赛宫🌟，一边成立了皇家制造厂，让镜子这种奢侈品开始国产化。 奢侈品从王公贵族的宫廷生活延伸至工艺品、香水、家具🪑与时装👗，奠定了法国“时尚与奢华”的国家品牌。 为什么法国能称霸奢侈品界？ 🧐
这不是偶然，是一场“国家级的精心策划”：
1⃣ 历史文化传承：早在路易十四时代，奢华就已渗透进法国文化
2⃣ 政府全力扶持：法国政府长期为奢侈时尚行业提供资金、打击假货、保护品牌
3⃣ 手工艺精神：传承工坊文化，注重细节与品质
4⃣本地化营销：如在中国市场，会推出中式节日限定款
5⃣ 营造稀缺性：通过限量发售、候补名单营造“买不到”的高端感
6⃣银幕上的加持与文化影响：从赫本到梦露，明星效应强化法国品牌影响力✨
7⃣高端生活方式打造：不只是衣服包包，更是一种“精致的生活方式”
🫅强大的奢侈品集团
就像美国有科技四巨头 GAFA（Google、Amazon、Facebook、Apple）
法国也有自己的奢侈品四巨头——KHOL：
▪️Kering开云集团：旗下有Gucci、YSL、Balenciaga、BV等。 ▪️Hermès爱马仕：独立但实力强劲，球最难买的品牌之一，以手工工艺闻名。 ▪️L'Oréal欧莱雅：美妆界的王者，旗下包含Lancôme、YSL Beauty、Kiehl's等
▪️LVMH路威酩轩：涵盖Louis Vuitton、Dior、Celine、Fendi等80+品品牌。 这些集团凭借并购➕品牌矩阵➕高端战略，牢牢掌控全球市场话语权。 法国奢侈品，是艺术、工艺、身份与文化的集合。 不是一只包，而是一个故事📖
不是一瓶香水，而是一段传承💫

n1gcszy,"  Hey. I'm not a big makeup girl, but the best advice I was given was to get my skincare right first. I needed to exfoliate, hydrate, etc. That helped tremendously with my makeup routine- especially caking. I don't like a very heavy look, so I use Dior concealer on areas where I need it and blend it out well with a few dabs to keep things even. I do some brows to frame and mascara to open up my eyes. I finish with a quick neutral lip to wrap things up. Skincare was the real game changer. I went to a few stores, but what helped the most was telling Chat GPT my skin concerns. Then I used the suggested regimen and voila! Things are much better.","Hey. I'm not a big makeup girl, but the best advice I was given was to get my skincare right first.

n1k5oym,"  Emmy is on my permanent shit list because of this incident. Sorry if it's a bit long… Back in 2010/2011 I was still in college and interning part time at a fashion PR agency. Basically in our office we also had a showroom with designer gowns, shoes, jewelry, etc of all the fashion brands that we represented. We represented anything from high end brands like Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, and Jimmy Choo, all the way down to smaller brands like Nicole Miller. The way it worked is that these gowns, etc would be rented out to celebrities to wear at red carpet events (or any big event where they'd be photographed). 90% of the time the stylists of these people would come in on their own, grab a bunch of items, and then return them after the event was done. However, every so often a celebrity would come in with them to pick out the pieces. One thing I should mention that's important to the story is that for the super luxury brands, we would only rent them out to super A list people (people like Angelina Jolie, Halle Berry, etc). For anyone B list or below we would only allow them to rent mid-size or smaller brands. This particular day, Emmy had come in with her stylist. Her stylist called us a head of time and demanded that we close off the show room to them only…. we don't usually do this, but we did it any ways. I was also told by my boss that Emmy was one of those people who didn't allow people to look at her or speak to her directly. The day Emmy and her stylist came in was a busy day for the actual publicists so I was instructed to help them pick out clothing. They also told me which designer dresses to not allow her to borrow. So Emmy and her stylist come in and while they're selecting items, I'm taking the inventory down. Emmy then gets to the Christian Dior rack and sees a dress she loves. Unfortunately that's one of the designers I'm not supposed to allow her to rent from. I let her stylist know this who then told Emmy. Emmy then starts throwing a full blown temper tantrum and starts yelling at me to the point where both my manager and the owner of the agency come out to calm her down. We then have to lie to her and say that this particular dress is already on hold for someone else. They ended up leaving with the other rented items, but after this the owner of an agency made it a rule that no celebrities are allowed to come in with their stylists. Usually stylists know which designers their clients can and can't wear, and banning clients from the office prevents a lot of drama.","Emmy is on my permanent shit list because of this incident.

E talvez não exista ocasião melhor para observar essa dinâmica em ação do que durante os grandes eventos culturais do Cariri, como a Festa do Pau da Bandeira, o Juaforró e, claro, a aguardada Expocrato. A cada edição, o que vemos é uma verdadeira passarela a céu aberto, onde a movimentação do público revela mais do que tendências: mostra como identidade, memória e desejo se cruzam na construção do vestir. Em 2025, o que se destaca é a pluralidade. Se antes havia uma separação nítida entre o que era “moda da cidade” e o “estilo do sertão”, hoje esses limites estão cada vez mais borrados — e é aí que mora a riqueza. O streetwear dialoga com o forró raiz, o boho abraça o country, o artesanal invade o urbano. A moda no Cariri não copia: ela reinventa. E o resultado são looks autorais, criativos, e muitas vezes mais relevantes do que os que vemos nas grandes passarelas. Neste momento da temporada fashion, as lojas varejistas do Cariri já começam a lançar suas Coleções Expocrato . Enquanto influenciadores digitais promovem marcas e produtos que, muitas vezes, não refletem a realidade ou o estilo do público que frequenta o evento, os consumidores saem em busca de visuais que combinem com o clima da festa — sem abrir mão do custo-benefício.

Foto: Divulgação.   Country repaginado: o sertanejo que fala com o pop Não é coincidência que o estilo western esteja em alta. A cultura pop tem jogado luz sobre o country com narrativas que atualizam seus códigos visuais — como fez Beyoncé em Cowboy Carter , misturando herança negra, orgulho texano e estética maximalista. E ela não está sozinha: artistas como Lil Nas X, Dua Lipa e Post Malone também embarcaram nessa vibe western , misturando tradição e modernidade nos palcos e videoclipes. A tendência ultrapassou o universo musical e chegou às telas. Séries como Yellowstone (2018–2024) e Godless (2017), ambientadas no Oeste americano do século XIX, ajudaram a reacender o fascínio por esse visual rústico. Já nas passarelas, o xadrez — presença obrigatória no guarda-roupa sertanejo — apareceu com força na coleção Cruise 2025 , da marca francesa Dior, mostrando que até o luxo de grife se rende ao charme do country.   Coleção Cruise 2025, da marca Dior. Foto: Divulgação.   O sertanejo remixado  No Cariri, a moda western ganha uma releitura moderna e funcional, adaptada ao calor, ao ritmo dos eventos e ao estilo de quem frequenta festas como a Expocrato. Coturnos e botas de cano alto são os queridinhos da vez, assim como saias de couro, jaquetas de camurça, calças jeans de cintura alta e cintos com fivelas marcantes. A combinação certa entre esses elementos garante um visual estiloso, sem abrir mão do conforto necessário para dançar e curtir. O varejo local oferece conjuntos completos inspirados no western por preços que cabem no bolso — a partir de R$ 250. Já plataformas online, como a Shein, disponibilizam calças de couro ecológico por cerca de R$ 150. A dica é investir em peças-chave que podem ser reaproveitadas em outras ocasiões, como uma boa bota ou um cinto com design diferenciado. Para completar as composições, vale apostar em acessórios com pegada boho ou rústica : brincos de argola, colares com pedras naturais, lenços no pescoço e até bolsas com franjas. O importante é montar um visual que una identidade, conforto e ousadia — com o carimbo do Cariri.   Inspirações de visuais que fazem referência ao country repaginado. Foto: Reprodução/Pinterest.   Boho chic: o charme vintage que conquista o sertão Cores terrosas, estampas orgânicas, tecidos leves e um toque de suavidade definem o estilo boho — uma moda que une liberdade e sofisticação. Com elementos em comum com a estética country, como botas, acessórios marcantes e jeans, o boho pode facilmente se misturar a ela. Mas suas origens são distintas: ele nasce da influência dos artistas folk, indie e hippies dos anos 1970, incorporando referências românticas, vintage e boêmias. Um dos maiores ícones recentes dessa estética é a personagem Daisy Jones, da série Daisy Jones & The Six , da Amazon Prime Video. Ambientada na Los Angeles dos anos 70, a série retrata o visual boho de forma fiel e encantadora: vestidos fluidos, calças flare, batas leves e tops camponeses compõem um estilo despojado, mas cheio de atitude e glamour nostálgico. Nas passarelas, a marca francesa Chloé é uma das principais representantes do boho chic contemporâneo. Seus desfiles de 2025 reafirmam a tendência com peças como vestidos esvoaçantes, batas com babados, sandálias gladiadoras e franjas delicadas — tudo isso em tons naturais que remetem ao deserto, à terra e à natureza.    ...","SPR_COMBO[pt]A moda nunca é apenas sobre o que se veste — mas sobre quem veste, onde veste, por que veste.

A dica é investir em peças-chave que podem ser reaproveitadas em outras ocasiões, como uma boa bota ou um cinto com design diferenciado. Para completar as composições, vale apostar em acessórios com pegada boho ou rústica : brincos de argola, colares com pedras naturais, lenços no pescoço e até bolsas com franjas. O importante é montar um visual que una identidade, conforto e ousadia — com o carimbo do Cariri. Inspirações de visuais que fazem referência ao country repaginado. Foto: Reprodução/Pinterest. Boho chic: o charme vintage que conquista o sertão Cores terrosas, estampas orgânicas, tecidos leves e um toque de suavidade definem o estilo boho — uma moda que une liberdade e sofisticação. Com elementos em comum com a estética country, como botas, acessórios marcantes e jeans, o boho pode facilmente se misturar a ela. Mas suas origens são distintas: ele nasce da influência dos artistas folk, indie e hippies dos anos 1970, incorporando referências românticas, vintage e boêmias. Um dos maiores ícones recentes dessa estética é a personagem Daisy Jones, da série Daisy Jones & The Six , da Amazon Prime Video. Ambientada na Los Angeles dos anos 70, a série retrata o visual boho de forma fiel e encantadora: vestidos fluidos, calças flare, batas leves e tops camponeses compõem um estilo despojado, mas cheio de atitude e glamour nostálgico. Nas passarelas, a marca francesa Chloé é uma das principais representantes do boho chic contemporâneo. Seus desfiles de 2025 reafirmam a tendência com peças como vestidos esvoaçantes, batas com babados, sandálias gladiadoras e franjas delicadas — tudo isso em tons naturais que remetem ao deserto, à terra e à natureza. ...",2025-07-06 11:40:29,pt,WEB,,,,f368b6f22d05ea10334571f5208032bc,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,"This is a detailed, journalistic-style article about fashion trends in the Cariri region of Brazil, with a specific focus on western and boho chic styles.

In your piece on “Revisiting Akeredolu's cenotaph of controversy”, you dwelt extensively on the first cement block house in Owo. To be precise and correct, the first cement block house in Owo was built by Chief S. B. Aruwajoye in 1947 at No 9, Owaluwa Square, Owo. It was not necessarily the first two-storey building in the town but was popular because of the novel fancy block of its external walls.

As she prepares to welcome her third child with A$AP Rocky, the Fenty founder and Smurfs star is getting a whole lot of love, support, and late-night snack deliveries from her partner of five years. According to People, the couple is “thrilled” to be growing their family again, and sources close to the pair say this pregnancy feels different — softer, slower, and somehow even more full of love. “He's completely tuned into her needs,” the insider shared of Rocky, who's been “incredibly attentive and nurturing” as Rihanna rests and gets ready for baby no. 3. Related story Rihanna's Baby Bump Is on Full Display at the Met Gala After Revealing Her 3rd Pregnancy While some dads might think diaper duty earns them a gold star, Rocky's in full-service mode. He's reportedly handling bedtime routines, entertaining sons RZA, 3, and Riot Rose, almost 2, and running baths for Rihanna at the end of the day. Yes, baths. With foot rubs. And snacks. “He always makes her laugh,” the source added. “He keeps things light and full of love.” ASAP Rocky, Rihanna at the Dior Homme show as part of Paris Men's Fashion Week on June 27, 2025 in Paris. Swan Gallet/WWD The couple revealed the pregnancy just ahead of the 2025 Met Gala — in true Rihanna fashion, by casually stepping out of The Carlyle in a powder-blue two-piece with her bump on full display. It marked her third major pregnancy reveal in as many years, following her viral 2023 Super Bowl moment and her first pregnancy announcement in 2022, when she wore a $29K outfit in a paparazzi photo, per Us Weekly. Still, this time seems more intimate. Back in December, Rihanna joked that the only thing she hadn't achieved yet was having a daughter. “I'm batting at 75 percent for a boy next time,” she told E! News. “So, we'll just keep our fingers crossed.” And in April, she doubled down: “I would try for my girl,” she told Interview. “But of course, if it's another boy, it's another boy.” Either way, Rocky's right there next to her. Even if he doesn't help dress the kids — “That's their mother by herself,” he admitted last year — he still plays muse. “Sometimes she dresses them like me… kilts and all of that,” he said. Now, with a third baby on the way and a nightly foot rub seemingly locked in, it's safe to say this might be Rihanna's coziest pregnancy yet.

The 41-year-old revealed earlier this year that she had underwent surgery for endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, which can potentially lead to infertility and other complications. Alexa was diagnosed with the condition in July 2020, calling her experience in getting treatment ""frustrating"" while services were ""under-funded"". In April 2025, the Popworld presenter confirmed her first Vinted sale drop, in which she flogged items from her own wardrobe in order to raise money for Endometriosis UK, prompting millennial hysteria. She has since taken part in other drops, with the latest confirmed in the video she shared to TikTok on Wednesday (July 2). ""I'll be selling things such as these glorious boots,"" Alexa told viewers in front of a backdrop featuring the piar of black, leather Prada boots. ""I literally love them, they've served me very well but they've gotta go. Because, the proceeds go to Endometriosis UK, which is, of course, very close to my womb, I guess. ""There's load of other amazing things in there [the drop], they've got a Dior bag - a really nice, 90s red sequence dress. And I want to say thank you so much if you bought things last time."" More than 1.5million people in the UK live with the condition, roughly one in 10 women. Since her diagnosis, Alexa has continued to campaign and raise awareness for Endometriosis UK. Speaking earlier this year, Alexa told The Telegraph how she had underwent a laparoscopy, where the pelvis is accessed through small incisions, to cut out the affected tissue to try and aid her symptoms.

mov_93FF9F17A8A0288BB817116B811230E4,"  Rihanna recently headed for Paris to attend Men's Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2026, which included a stop at the AWGE (a.k.a. the label founded by her partner, A$AP Rocky) and Dior shows. For the artist, every appearance is an excuse to adorn herself with beautiful pieces. But a fashion show? That's when she takes her jewelry to a whole other level. Rihanna has worn a lot of extraordinary pieces over the years, but we couldn't take our eyes off the pearl and cameo necklace that served as a centerpiece for her look at Dior. As usual, Rihanna is proving that she's aware—and always a step ahead–of the latest trends. Whether they're mounted as pendants or set in a romantic ring, cameos are back in fashion. Cut from resin and tinged with a baroque touch, the old-fashioned jewelry trend is seeing a new life on and off the catwalk. To pay witness to the first collection by Jonathan Anderson, newly appointed head of Dior's men's collections, the star adorned herself in the jewelry classic by wearing a Marlo Laz pearl choker. The three-row necklace features a central cameo haloed by diamonds and a baroque pearl. Rihanna also wore two cameo rings by Lydia Courteille dated from the 19th century. Cameos are an art form in which an image is carved in relief on a precious or semi-precious stone, often composed of several layers of different colors. The fact that it's back on trend feels rooted in the “bygone glamour” phenomenon currently hitting the fashion cycle—that is, a return to vintage looks driven by nostalgia for past decades. Pearls, signet rings, and now cameos are now being dusted off and reimagined by designers like Jesse Marlo Lazowski, the founder of Marlo Laz, and fashion insiders a la Rihanna. Inspired?

I've been to events before, but this one felt... different. Intimate. Magical. Deeply cultural. Have you ever walked into a room and felt like you were stepping into someone's fairytale? Phones Down, Glam On Before entering the venue, we were asked to seal our phones in small plastic pouches — no cameras, no social media, no distractions. At first, I felt the reflex to reach for my phone, to capture something, anything... but then I realized: maybe this night isn't meant to be captured. Maybe it's meant to be lived. Would you be okay giving up your phone for the night if it meant being fully present? An Entrance Fit for a Queen To the right: a mini salon for touch-ups. To the left: a coffee bar with Arabic blends and Turkish tea. And everywhere in between: fresh flowers, oversized mirrors, and perfume stations filled with Chanel, Dior, and elegant oud blends that lingered in the air like poetry. Before stepping into the event hall, we were in abayas. But just before entering, we gracefully took them off, revealing our evening gowns — each one more stunning than the next. Mine was a sparkly silver piece, but honestly? Every woman in that room looked like art. A Celebration of Femininity and Tradition We greeted one another cheek to cheek, guided to our table by the bride's sister. Even the servers wore pressed uniforms, gracefully pouring endless cups of karak and herbal tea. Everything was intentional — from the Narumi bone china plates to the floral centerpieces that stood tall like sculptures. And the food? Think creamy hummus, beef stew, chicken biryani, sambusa, and more. But more than taste, it was the energy of being surrounded by women in full bloom — confident, graceful, glowing — that truly fed my soul. Have you ever felt beauty in a room so strongly, it didn't need to be said out loud? Then She Walked In... The bride entered like a vision — her dress glittering like stardust, her pace soft and steady. Romantic music filled the room. Big screens framed her walk to the stage. She looked like she belonged in a fairytale, but one grounded in heritage and pride. There was a collective pause, a silent awe — the kind you don't interrupt. A Shift in Energy Later, we were asked to wear our abayas again — the groom and his family were about to arrive. The vibe shifted: a little more formal, a little more sacred. I watched as he gazed at the bride, visibly in love. And though no photos were allowed, that moment will live in my memory far longer than anything I could've posted. What This Night Taught Me It reminded me that sometimes, the most beautiful moments are the ones we don't capture. That elegance isn't about extravagance — it's about intention. And that when women come together in celebration, something powerful happens. Would you say yes to attending a wedding like this if invited? Would you leave your phone behind and trust the moment to hold itself? Let's Talk: Have you ever experienced a wedding that made you feel something this deeply? Or have you ever been to a cultural celebration that opened your eyes to a new kind of beauty? I'd love to hear your story — leave a comment or DM me on Instagram.","The Invitation That Sparked Curiosity Two nights ago, I attended a Qatari wedding at the Grand Hyatt Doha — and I still find myself replaying it in my head.

The bride entered like a vision — her dress glittering like stardust, her pace soft and steady. Romantic music filled the room. Big screens framed her walk to the stage. She looked like she belonged in a fairytale, but one grounded in heritage and pride. There was a collective pause, a silent awe — the kind you don't interrupt. A Shift in Energy Later, we were asked to wear our abayas again — the groom and his family were about to arrive. The vibe shifted: a little more formal, a little more sacred. I watched as he gazed at the bride, visibly in love. And though no photos were allowed, that moment will live in my memory far longer than anything I could've posted. What This Night Taught Me It reminded me that sometimes, the most beautiful moments are the ones we don't capture. That elegance isn't about extravagance — it's about intention. And that when women come together in celebration, something powerful happens. Would you say yes to attending a wedding like this if invited? Would you leave your phone behind and trust the moment to hold itself? Let's Talk: Have you ever experienced a wedding that made you feel something this deeply? Or have you ever been to a cultural celebration that opened your eyes to a new kind of beauty?

But I wrote this a while back Monica Geller-Bing Career – After adopting Jack and Erica with Chandler, Monica worked part-time as a catering chef to spend more time at home. – As the kids grew older, she opened Monica's Kitchen, a catering company specialising in family dinners and events. – She has won New York's Best Home Chef twice and teaches cooking classes on weekends. Family – Jack and Erica are now teenagers. Jack loves basketball and plays for his school team, while Erica loves photography and dreams of working for National Geographic. – Monica is the ultimate organised mom – planning healthy meals, colour-coding calendars, and volunteering at their school. Marriage – She and Chandler are still strong. Monica knows he doesn't always understand her need for perfection, but he loves her for it. – Every autumn, they go away for a weekend in Vermont to reconnect and drink wine by the fireplace. Home – They still live in Westchester in the house they moved to after adopting the twins. Monica has remodelled the kitchen three times to get it “just right.” Chandler Bing Career – Chandler stayed in advertising but transitioned to a more creative writing role after feeling burnt out. Now he mostly writes campaigns from home. – He is the dad known for embarrassing jokes at school pickup, but the kids love him. Family – Erica shares his sense of humour, while Jack comes to him for late-night advice about girls and life. Marriage – Chandler still calls Monica “the most beautiful girl in any room,” and makes her laugh daily, which she considers his best trait.

Family – When Ben turned 18 and went to college in California, Ross and Rachel decided to move to Paris for Rachel's job at Louis Vuitton. – They lived there for six years, where Ross worked at the Natural History Museum of Paris and learned fluent French (though Phoebe still makes fun of his accent). – Emma grew up bilingual and now studies fashion in Paris, while Ross and Rachel moved back to New York two years ago when Lily started high school. – Ben is 29, working as a social worker in San Francisco, and visits often. Marriage – Ross and Rachel finally married in a small ceremony on a Paris rooftop at sunset. Rachel wore a simple but stunning silk dress, and Ross cried through his vows. – They still bicker about small things but always end up laughing. Rachel Green Career – Rachel excelled at Louis Vuitton and became Head of Global Merchandising. After returning to New York, she works from home half the time to be there for Lily. – She mentors young female designers and frequently travels to Paris for work, feeling like it's her second home.

Demna, known for his daring work as well as controversies during his decade-long stint at Kering-owned Balenciaga, will unveil his final collection on Wednesday in what is expected to be one of the highlights of the week. Not to be confused with Paris Fashion Week, Haute Couture Week takes place exclusively in Paris — in January for spring-summer collections and July for autumn-winter. It is a uniquely French event dedicated to handcrafted, one-of-a-kind creations made to wear at red carpets, galas, and other high-profile events. The 44-year-old Demna, acclaimed by millennials and Gen-Z stars from Kim Kardashian to British pop sensation Charli XCX, has been tasked with reviving the flagging fortunes of Gucci by Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault. After multiplying sales at Balenciaga, where he made headlines with a $2,000 ""Ikea"" bag and a $1,800 so-called ""trash pouch"", he is currently being honoured with an exhibition titled ""Balenciaga by Demna"" at Kering's Paris headquarters. He will be succeeded by Italian designer Pierpaolo Piccioli, who is set to present his first collection in October during Paris Women's Fashion Week. As usual, Schiaparelli will open Couture Week, followed later in the day by shows from Iris Van Herpen —- returning after a year-long break -— as well as Georges Hobeika, Imane Ayissi, Rahul Mishra, Julie de Libran, and Giambattista Valli. After Demna's farewell on Wednesday, Belgian designer Glenn Martens will find himself in the spotlight as he unveils a first collection for Maison Margiela following his appointment in January to succeed British designer John Galliano. American designer Michael Rider, who succeeded Hedi Slimane as chief designer at Celine, unveiled his first collection for the luxury French brand on Sunday, outside the official calendar. – Absences – On Tuesday, Chanel will present the final collection created by its in-house design studio, the fifth since Virginie Viard's sudden departure in June 2024. More in Style Her successor, the discreet and highly respected Franco-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy, was appointed in December and will showcase his first collection for Chanel in October. Up to Thursday, 27 houses will unveil their creations, including Elie Saab, Armani Prive, Aelis, Viktor&Rolf, Adeline Andre, and Dubai-based Rami Al Ali who is set to become the first Syrian to join the official calendar. Following a spate of major changes at fashion houses, some absences will stand out, particularly Dior's. After a highly anticipated debut during the men's Fashion Week on June 27, newly appointed artistic director Jonathan Anderson is holding back his first haute couture collection for January 2026. Named in early June to lead Dior's women's and couture lines as well, the 40-year-old Northern Irishman has become the first person since founder Christian Dior himself to oversee all three branches of the house. Jean Paul Gaultier is also missing. Dutch designer Duran Lantink, appointed as the brand's permanent artistic director in April, will make his debut during Women's Fashion Week in October. Since stepping back in 2020, Jean Paul Gaultier has handed over the reins of his couture collections to a series of guest designers, including Olivier Rousteing, Ludovic de Saint Sernin, Haider Ackermann, and Simone Rocha.
