A longtime collaborator of Dior's, the Mumbai-based studio is renowned for its work in preserving and teaching an array of craft techniques, as well as creating immersive installations based on artworks. Nearly three decades ago, Chanakya's artistic director, Karishma Swali, first connected with designer Maria Grazia Chiuri and has since worked with her artisans to create immersive textiles for the brand's fashion shows, replicating and accompanying art by Judy Chicago, Faith Ringgold, Isabella Ducrot, and more. Earlier this year for Dior's Spring/Summer 2025 haute couture collection, Chanakya and graduates from its nonprofit, Chanakya School of Craft, created a backdrop of large-scale textile panels titled “The Flowers We Grew,” imagined by artist Rithika Merchant. The show's interior atmosphere was enlivened by nine large-scale panels that hung from the walls, each representing Indian heritage and values special to Merchant. Mimicking the brushstrokes and chemical composition of the watercolor paintings, the hand-embroidered collaboration took 306 artisans 144,000 hours to execute.

mov_150F23C7BE9A090914854CCA8F191542,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Ein Sommerduft muss nicht aufdringlich sein, er sollte eine gewisse Frische ausstrahlen, verspielt-ozeanisch sein und zugleich mysteriös und aufregend wirken. Suchst du aktuell nach einer Duftkomposition, die dich an einen Ort der Erholung und der Sinnlichkeit entführt? Dann haben wir genau das Richtige für dich. Wir verraten dir, welche sechs Sommerdüfte aktuell beliebt sind und sich auf jeder Wunschliste wiederfinden sollten. #1 „Nivea Creme“ von Nivea Mit dem Duft „Nivea Creme“ gibt es die klassische und beliebte Nivea Creme auch als Eau de Toilette. Der Duft wurde erstmals im Jahr 2011 lanciert und ist seither unverändert geblieben. Sein frischer Zitrusduft und seine sanften Lavendelnoten verleihen ihm eine unverkennbare Frische. Darüber hinaus betört das Parfum mit einer erhabenen Präsenz – damit wird der Unisex-Duft dem Hype gerecht und ist eines unserer Sommer-Staples. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #2 „Nivea Sun“ von Nivea Suchst du einen leichten und angenehmen Unisex-Duft für die warmen Sommertage, ist „Nivea Sun“ von Nivea dein Duft. Das trendy Eau de Toilette bietet ein erfrischendes Dufterlebnis, das an warme Sommertage am Meer erinnert. Sinnlich und aufregend gehalten, verschmilzt der Zitrus-Cocktail mit einem Bouquet aus Blumen sowie mit würzig holzigen Akkorden, welche ein sensuelles und verführerisches Gefühl erwecken. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #3 „Boss The Scent“ von Hugo Boss „Boss The Scent“ von Hugo Boss ist ein Parfum für die facettenreiche Frau. Der im Jahr 2016 lancierte Duft ist das Gegenstück zum gleichnamigen Herrenparfum und seither für seine sinnliche und verführerische Wirkung beliebt. Raffiniert und feminin in seiner Komposition, ist er eine Hommage an die selbstsichere und elegante Frau und vereint geschickt saftigen Pfirsich mit blumiger Osmanthusblüte. Abschließend bildet sinnlicher, weißer Moschus eine subtile, aber hinreißende Duftnuance, welche das Eau de Parfum zu einem Must-have der Saison macht. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. Schönheitsideale im Wandel der Zeit Schönheitsideale im Wandel der Zeit #4 „The One“ von Calvin Klein Der Duft „The One“ von Calvin Klein ist ein aromatisch-zitrischer und frischer Unisex-Duft für den Sommer. Das Eau de Toilette entzückt mit einer sauberen Komposition aus frischem, grünen Tee sowie floralen Rosen und Veilchen und rundet das Dufterlebnis mit einem sanften Abschluss aus sinnlichem Moschus und holzig verführerischer Ambra ab. Unaufdringlich und perfekt für den Alltag! Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #5 „Hypnotic Poison“ von Christian Dior Für alle, die im Sommer intensivere Düfte bevorzugen, ist „Hypnotic Poison“ von Christian Dior die perfekte Wahl. In der Kopfnote sorgt der orientalische Duft für einen frischen und saftig-pflaumigen Auftakt, während sich im Herzen ein florales Zusammenspiel aus Jasmin- und Rosenakkorden entfaltet. Die Basisnote umhüllt dich schließlich in eine sanft betörende und würzige Wolke aus Moschus, Sandelholz und Vanille – so kennen und lieben wir den traumhaft, verführerischen Signatur-Duft von Dior. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #6 „Light Blue“ von Dolce & Gabbana Unser last but not the least: „Light Blue“ von Dolce & Gabbana ist eine moderne Interpretation des klassischen Zitronenduftes. Das Eau de Toilette entführt dich an das belebende Mittelmeer und entfaltet ein leichtes und entspanntes Lebensgefühl. Dabei vereint es einen spannenden Cocktail aus fruchtigen, zitrischen und holzig-pudrigen Duftakkorden, welche den Duft der mediterranen Amalfiküste einfangen. Der elegante Flakon rundet das Erlebnis ab. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. Lust auf sinnlich florale Düfte bekommen? Florale Parfums verströmen einen Hauch von Sinnlichkeit und Verspieltheit, welche mehr Romantik und Leichtigkeit im Alltag hervorbringen. Wir verraten dir, um welche sieben trendy Düfte echte Pfingstrosen-Liebhaber*innen diese Saison nicht herumkommen.","SPR_COMBO[de]Ein Sommerduft muss nicht aufdringlich sein, er sollte eine gewisse Frische ausstrahlen, verspielt-ozeanisch sein und zugleich mysteriös und aufregend wirken.

mov_40D9ED93ACFBB2479F426AE4E07D0E73,"  It's rare for a West End theatre production to garner so much attention and excitement before opening night, yet that is exactly what Rachel Zegler has managed to do as she steps into the shoes of Eva Perón in director Jamie Lloyd's daring take on the beloved musical, Evita. Over the last two weeks of preview shows, Zegler has stepped out on to the balcony of The London Palladium, the musical's new home, mid-performance to perform a powerful rendition of 'Don't Cry For Me, Argentina'. ' I don't think any of us expected it to garner as much attention as it did,' the 24-year-old actor reflects to ELLE UK, the morning after Evita's opening night. 'People have been camping out for hours before I go on and it's humbling, beautiful and fits in the story very well.' Starring as Perón, Zegler has received rave reviews for her passionate, high-voltage performance which follows the life of the Argentine political leader Juan Perón, and his second wife. The dynamic show, set to Andrew Lloyd Webber's soaring score, dominated social media during its preview period and has now officially opened its doors to London audiences. Pedro Pascal, Sarah Paulson and Keanu Reeves were among the high-profile guests at the Palladium on opening night to see Zegler belt out beloved ballads like 'Rainbow High' and 'A New Argentina'. 'Sarah texted me last week asking for the link to get tickets. I had no idea she meant last night,' Zegler exclaims. ' Then, our ensemble member Harrison Wilde asked me backstage, ""Rachel, is Pedro here? "" and I said he probably would have told me. Then, during 'Rainbow High', I saw Pedro stand up. I was like, ""Dad, you're embarrassing me! ""' she jokes. ' No, he was so sweet. Keanu Reeves was there, too. I was freaking out!' For the occasion, Zegler wore a SS25 beige tulle Haute Couture Dior ballgown adorned with bejewelled bows, designed by the house's recently departed creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri. On her look, Zegler worked closely with her long-time stylist Sarah Tooley to pay a visual tribute to her character's legacy. ' It was so evident to Sarah and I that Dior had to be a part of the night because of the lyrics of 'Rainbow High' being ""Christian Dior me from my head to my toes "",' she shares. 'Christian Dior was such an influence on Eva's fashion in real life, so we wanted to pay homage and have classic elements as well as the modern, diva and Madonna-esque version of Eva. That's why this design was so perfect.' Having worked with her since the start of Zegler's acting career, Tooley is a stylist she truly trusts. ' She knows my taste, but she also knows my body and what I'll feel comfortable in. That's a testament to the friendship and trust [we've] built,' Zegler reflects. Her look was finished with fine jewellery from London-based brands Ananya and David Morris, a fresh, glossy make-up look and her signature soft waves on the hair, styled by Valeria Ferreira and Dayaruci respectively. ' I want to look like myself as much as possible, so I can be myself in a professional sphere where a lot of pressure is on,' Zegler says of her glam approach. The opening night of Evita followed two weeks of preview shows, in which the production is tweaked nightly before it officially opens. ' That is both exhilarating and exhausting for an ensemble group of people, so it was such a wonderful experience to lock it and get the response we've had so far,' Zegler reflects. Still, one thing has remained consistent – the unprecedented reaction to the electric moment she leaves the stage and heads to the the theatre's balcony for the musical's most beloved number. 'It's brilliant,' Zegler says of the scene. ' The second Jamie said that's what he was trying to get permission from Westminster Council to do, I said ""We need to do anything to make that possibility real. "" But, as simple as it may seem, it's a huge production as there are a lot of technology and hard work involved to show the theatre inside the Palladium.' Zegler shares that audiences inside applaud nightly when they see the amount of people waiting outside as it's 'such a ridiculously impressive thing to pull off.' 'When we first performed it, it was just me in a robe and my wig to figure out the lighting and sound for the show. The odd person would stop and take a picture, but the next day, it was 100 people, then 20o and it would double in size. It's overwhelming but really moving.' As for the critics, Zegler states there's deeper meaning behind the spectacle. ' It's a testament to the fact that this show is based on history,' Zegler continues. ' Eva was a real person and there is no world in which she would want to impress people who could afford to see a show at a theatre. She wanted to bring her message to the streets and to the people. Jamie integrates the modern ingenuity of theatre by respecting the source material in such a way that serves such a beautiful purpose.' It's clear playing this role means a lot to Zegler. ' It's a dream come true. I haven't been on stage in a musical since high school [for Shrek The Musical, famously] and I missed it so much... When you get to live your dream, you don't take any second for granted and I'm not, I'm soaking in every second....","It's rare for a West End theatre production to garner so much attention and excitement before opening night, yet that is exactly what Rachel Zegler has managed to do as she steps into the shoes of Eva Perón in director Jamie Lloyd's daring take on the beloved musical, Evita.

mov_C117CD8F1AAE5835A6446F122EC43ED4,"  Hotel Cipriani in Venice has unveiled a magnificent bar and a boutique by Dior as part of its seasonal reopening, alongside a sweeping renovation by architect Peter Marino. Olivia Palamountain reports Venice's Hotel Cipriani has launched an exclusive Dior bar as part of its 2025 season reopening, marking a new collaboration between the legendary hospitality brand and the French luxury fashion house. Il Bacaro Dior (open Tuesday to Sunday from 6.30pm to 11.30pm) takes in glorious views over St. Mark's basin and features rattan furniture offset by cushions upholstered in green toile de Jouy - a heritage printed cloth produced by Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf in the 18th century. To amplify the branded experience, guests can take archipelago excursions on boats bearing the Dior signature. Located moments from St Mark's Square via the hotel's private boat service, Hotel Cipriani sits on the tip of the island with panoramic views across the Venetian lagoon. The property, which became Belmond's first acquisition in 1976, features Venice's largest private swimming pool, the over-water Cip's Club restaurant and the Casanova wellness centre. Alongside the bar, the luxury fashion house has installed a Dioriviera boutique, selling a collection of branded resortwear. The boutique features art installations including a large bamboo mural by Korakot and a glass sculpture by Simone Crestani, alongside hand-made furniture by Italian manufacturer Bonacina. Also new for 2025 are a series of renovations by architect and interior designer Peter Marino, who has overseen the refined redesign of 13 rooms including two master suites designed as Venetian apartments. Marino's multi-phase renovation includes two master suites featuring dining rooms, libraries and salons with lagoon views, plus 11 suites and junior suites with private balconies overlooking the Casanova Gardens. The architect has maintained the beloved lobby whilst creating an adjacent double-height arrival experience. New lagoon experiences for the summer season include sunset tours and enhanced dining at the Michelin-starred Oro restaurant, led by Chef Yana Ghedini in collaboration with world-renowned chef Massimo Bottura. The Il Bacaro Dior bar and Dioriviera boutique represent the latest luxury brand partnership for the Belmond property, which has operated on Giudecca Island since 1958. Elsewhere this year, Dior has also been busy. In March 2025, The Royal Scotsman, A Belmond Train, collaborated with Dior to create its first wellness retreat on wheels, featuring 'mindful movement' classes and naturopathic menus.

Located moments from St Mark's Square via the hotel's private boat service, Hotel Cipriani sits on the tip of the island with panoramic views across the Venetian lagoon. The property, which became Belmond's first acquisition in 1976, features Venice's largest private swimming pool, the over-water Cip's Club restaurant and the Casanova wellness centre. Alongside the bar, the luxury fashion house has installed a Dioriviera boutique, selling a collection of branded resortwear. The boutique features art installations including a large bamboo mural by Korakot and a glass sculpture by Simone Crestani, alongside hand-made furniture by Italian manufacturer Bonacina. Also new for 2025 are a series of renovations by architect and interior designer Peter Marino, who has overseen the refined redesign of 13 rooms including two master suites designed as Venetian apartments. Marino's multi-phase renovation includes two master suites featuring dining rooms, libraries and salons with lagoon views, plus 11 suites and junior suites with private balconies overlooking the Casanova Gardens. The architect has maintained the beloved lobby whilst creating an adjacent double-height arrival experience. New lagoon experiences for the summer season include sunset tours and enhanced dining at the Michelin-starred Oro restaurant, led by Chef Yana Ghedini in collaboration with world-renowned chef Massimo Bottura. The Il Bacaro Dior bar and Dioriviera boutique represent the latest luxury brand partnership for the Belmond property, which has operated on Giudecca Island since 1958. Elsewhere this year, Dior has also been busy. In March 2025, The Royal Scotsman, A Belmond Train, collaborated with Dior to create its first wellness retreat on wheels, featuring 'mindful movement' classes and naturopathic menus.

mov_93FF9F17A8A0288BB817116B811230E4,"  Rihanna recently headed for Paris to attend Men's Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2026, which included a stop at the AWGE (a.k.a. the label founded by her partner, A$AP Rocky) and Dior shows. For the artist, every appearance is an excuse to adorn herself with beautiful pieces. But a fashion show? That's when she takes her jewelry to a whole other level. Rihanna has worn a lot of extraordinary pieces over the years, but we couldn't take our eyes off the pearl and cameo necklace that served as a centerpiece for her look at Dior. As usual, Rihanna is proving that she's aware—and always a step ahead–of the latest trends. Whether they're mounted as pendants or set in a romantic ring, cameos are back in fashion. Cut from resin and tinged with a baroque touch, the old-fashioned jewelry trend is seeing a new life on and off the catwalk. To pay witness to the first collection by Jonathan Anderson, newly appointed head of Dior's men's collections, the star adorned herself in the jewelry classic by wearing a Marlo Laz pearl choker. The three-row necklace features a central cameo haloed by diamonds and a baroque pearl. Rihanna also wore two cameo rings by Lydia Courteille dated from the 19th century. Cameos are an art form in which an image is carved in relief on a precious or semi-precious stone, often composed of several layers of different colors. The fact that it's back on trend feels rooted in the “bygone glamour” phenomenon currently hitting the fashion cycle—that is, a return to vintage looks driven by nostalgia for past decades.

For the artist, every appearance is an excuse to adorn herself with beautiful pieces. But a fashion show? That's when she takes her jewelry to a whole other level. Rihanna has worn a lot of extraordinary pieces over the years, but we couldn't take our eyes off the pearl and cameo necklace that served as a centerpiece for her look at Dior. As usual, Rihanna is proving that she's aware—and always a step ahead–of the latest trends. Whether they're mounted as pendants or set in a romantic ring, cameos are back in fashion. Cut from resin and tinged with a baroque touch, the old-fashioned jewelry trend is seeing a new life on and off the catwalk. To pay witness to the first collection by Jonathan Anderson, newly appointed head of Dior's men's collections, the star adorned herself in the jewelry classic by wearing a Marlo Laz pearl choker. The three-row necklace features a central cameo haloed by diamonds and a baroque pearl. Rihanna also wore two cameo rings by Lydia Courteille dated from the 19th century.
