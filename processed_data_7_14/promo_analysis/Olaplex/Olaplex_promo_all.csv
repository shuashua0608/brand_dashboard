Marinelli Miller CanfieldMiller Canfield Resources The Made in the USA label carries significant marketing weight, especially in today's political landscape, but it also comes with legal risks. Federal regulators and class action attorneys are scrutinizing origin claims, leading major brands to face substantial penalties. The primary enforcement avenue for the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') is its Made in USA Labeling Rule, issued in 2021, which states that a product cannot be labeled as Made in the USA unless 'all or virtually all' of its components are made in the U.S. A corporation must have and rely on a 'reasonable basis' to back up a claim that its product was made in the U.S. There are generally two types of Made in the USA claims-qualified and unqualified. Unqualified claims,i.e.,those that do not explain or limit the extent to which a product has been made in the U.S., present the most risk for businesses. To make an unqualified Made in the USA claim, the product must be 'all or virtually all' made in the U.S. This means: (1) the final assembly or processing occurs in the U.S.; (2) all significant processing that goes into the product occurs in the U.S.; or (3) all or virtually all ingredients/components are made and sourced in the U.S. The FTC considers other factors as well, including how much of the total manufacturing costs can be assigned to the U.S., how far-removed foreign content is from the final product, and the importance of foreign content to the final product. Additionally, a product may claim to be 'Assembled in the USA' if its last 'substantial transformation' occurred in the U.S. Critically, when foreign components are assembled into a final product in the U.S., it is not a 'substantial transformation.' Qualified claimsdescribe the extent, amount or type of a product's domestic content or processing. For example, an advertisement claiming that a product includes '60% U.S. content' or was 'Made in the USA of U.S. and imported parts.' Qualified claims may be appropriate if a product 'include[s] U.S. content or processing' but otherwise fails to meet the criteria for an unqualified Made in the USA claim. Many corporations-both big and small-have faced class action lawsuits and FTC investigations regarding their claims that products are Made in the USA. As a result, companies are paying multi-million-dollar settlements: In April, a California jury hit R.C. Bigelow with a $2.36 million judgment in a class action lawsuit over its Made in the USA claims. While the company admitted to sourcing its tea from overseas, it argued that the label referred to the tea bags and assembly process. [1] In February, haircare brand Olaplex settled a lawsuit that alleged certain produces were falsely advertised as Made in the USA. Without admitting wrongdoing, Olaplex agreed to send $5 vouchers to class members in addition to paying $1.35 million in fees and costs. [2] In 2024, Williams-Sonoma paid the biggest civil penalty in a Made in the USA enforcement case by the FTC totaling $3.17 million. [3] And there are several class action lawsuits currently pending against many other companies. [4] What To Do Corporations should remember that they have an ongoing obligation to ensure that their products are correctly labeled, which also means communicating with suppliers and manufacturers. Additionally, corporations should consider their use of U.S. imagery on their products to avoid making an implied Made in the USA claim without substantiation. [1]Banks v. R.C.

n0t29qm,"  lots of other folks have mentioned that the example picture is dimensional vs all over color. like others have said, it would be better to use a 20 vol developer with the lightener powder for a longer period of time, instead of using 30 volume for a shorter period of time. if you got to the strand test color in 30 mins with 30 volume, you can definitely achieve it with a longer processing time using 20 volume and you'd be less likely to cause major damage. you can process for up to an hour, so just keep checking the color while the lightener processes. my recommendation would be to lighten your entire head in sections like you said you plan to, to get to a base color similar to what your strand test looks like. if you can wait a couple days and do some deep conditioning treatments after you have your base color, that would be best. i'd then go back in with a technique like this to achieve something similar to the highlights shown in your goal picture — she's obviously using a different tone of color here, but the takeaway of the video should be the lightener application techniques: https://youtu.be/gegncnXXxi0 pay attention to the volumes she is using — DO NOT go back in to highlight your base with 30 volume developer, your highlights will fry. you must use a 10 volume developer and give it time to process. she also has a lot of other great videos about doing highlights if you wanna browse her channel — again, don't focus on the color/toner shades she's using, just the bleach application techniques to help achieve the dimensional look in your example. imo, if you are okay with your base color matching your swatch, you'd be better off leaving it at that and then adding the highlights with a volume 10 developer, versus trying to lighten your whole head again. your hair would be much better off that way, versus trying to push it with another whole head application of lightener! you'd be very close to the example photo anyway after toning. sally's ion line has an olaplex dupe that you should definitely pick up. it's under $15 and one set would probably get you through 2-3 processes, so you might wanna pick up 2 boxes if your hair is thick, because it would be better to to have a little extra for next time vs. running out. here's the link, they have it in stores too: https://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-color/other-products-and-applications/fillers-and-additives/absolute-perfection-dual-kit/SBS-405019.html i'd also buy some k18 and apply it before/after processes: cheapest option here that i have been able to squeeze 2-3 applications out of in the past, but you'd be better off investing in the $30 pump bottle that's available on amazon: https://www.target.com/p/k18-leave-in-molecular-repair-hair-mask-0-17-oz/-/A-85972091 and then use a bond repairing shampoo and conditioner to help rebuild your hair integrity after all these processes. redken's bond repair line is pretty good and relatively affordable! pick up a nice serum too to keep the mids/ends healthy. if you can't invest in these products, i promise your hair would look better at whatever color it is now than lighter and unhealthy! but i think if you invest in the bond builder from sally's, k18, and a bond repairing shampoo and conditioner, your goal example is within reach. also not sure what your current base color is like or if you've done a whole head lightening process before, but make sure you understand how to apply the lightener for a whole head application so you don't end up with an uneven base color before you go back in to highlight. if you don't apply the lightener correctly you will end up with really uneven color — lighter roots from the heat of your head accelerating the bleach, etc. here is a good video that explains how to approach whole head lightening — as with the other example video, don't focus on the end result color, just pay attention to the techniques used to achieve an even color. adjust the processing times according to your goal base color: https://youtu.be/tYg3ZmbX5iw?si=mXSeHVLH6rBVWubP saw that you don't have sally's in your country. there are other products similar to olaplex; see if you can find ALL hd PLEX or LIW ph plex!

Initially the smell is divine. It smells exactly like BBW luminous. It kind of smoothened the ends. I can only imagine how smooth my hair would get if applied on damp hair. Purpose of buying this is coz chatgpt said it can perform as a dupe to k18, Olaplex focused on bond repair. If this did work really well then it's surely a very well made product at a budget price.

mov_091AD4C730FA61D9851F6AE1B6DCAFE4,"  SPR_COMBO[es]En la era donde los rizos son símbolo de identidad, orgullo y empoderamiento, ya no basta con un simple gel de fijación. Hoy buscamos algo que respete la fibra capilar, que dé forma sin frizz, que abrace la textura natural sin dejarla tiesa, y que además repare. En ese escenario nace el Olaplex Nº. 10 Bond Shaper®, un producto que no solo moldea tus rizos, sino que trabaja desde adentro para reconstruir los enlaces rotos del cabello. Si has oído hablar del “sistema de reparación molecular” de Olaplex, sabrás que no es una marca más: es una revolución en la industria capilar, con fórmulas patentadas que han cambiado la forma de tratar el cabello dañado. Y su Nº. 10 no se queda atrás: es el primer gel definidor de rizos con tecnología reparadora Bond Building. Lo que hace especial a este gel no es solo su acabado brillante, ni su capacidad de definir ondas sin apelmazarlas. Es su ingrediente estrella: el Bis-Aminopropyl Diglycol Dimaleate, el complejo molecular exclusivo de Olaplex, que reconecta los enlaces de disulfuro dañados por coloración, calor o maltrato físico. Pero no solo eso: aporta fijación flexible sin rigidez, elimina el frizz incluso con humedad alta, aumenta la elasticidad del rizo y mejora su memoria y proporciona brillo sin residuos ni acartonamiento. La textura es ligera, se funde con el cabello húmedo o seco, y no deja residuos pegajosos. Es ideal tanto para rizos tipo 2B como para 4C. En pruebas realizadas por usuarios: El 87 % notó rizos más definidos y suaves después de una sola aplicación. El 94 % dijo tener menos frizz tras 48 horas.

Frente a gels convencionales de 10 o 15 euros que ofrecen solo fijación temporal (y muchas veces resecan), el Olaplex Nº. 10 es un híbrido que trata, embellece y protege. En otras palabras: es skincare para tu cabello rizado. @mundistyle","SPR_COMBO[es]En la era donde los rizos son símbolo de identidad, orgullo y empoderamiento, ya no basta con un simple gel de fijación. Hoy buscamos algo que respete la fibra capilar, que dé forma sin frizz, que abrace la textura natural sin dejarla tiesa, y que además repare. En ese escenario nace el Olaplex Nº. 10 Bond Shaper, un producto que no solo moldea tus rizos, sino que trabaja desde adentro para reconstruir los enlaces rotos del cabello. Si has oído hablar del “sistema de reparación molecular” de Olaplex, sabrás que no es una marca más: es una revolución en la industria capilar, con fórmulas patentadas que han cambiado la forma de tratar el cabello dañado. Y su Nº. 10 no se queda atrás: es el primer gel definidor de rizos con tecnología reparadora Bond Building. Lo que hace especial a este gel no es solo su acabado brillante, ni su capacidad de definir ondas sin apelmazarlas. Es su ingrediente estrella: el Bis-Aminopropyl Diglycol Dimaleate, el complejo molecular exclusivo de Olaplex, que reconecta los enlaces de disulfuro dañados por coloración, calor o maltrato físico. Pero no solo eso: aporta fijación flexible sin rigidez, elimina el frizz incluso con humedad alta, aumenta la elasticidad del rizo y mejora su memoria y proporciona brillo sin residuos ni acartonamiento. La textura es ligera, se funde con el cabello húmedo o seco, y no deja residuos pegajosos. Es ideal tanto para rizos tipo 2B como para 4C. En pruebas realizadas por usuarios: El 87 % notó rizos más definidos y suaves después de una sola aplicación. El 94 % dijo tener menos frizz tras 48 horas. El 91 % sintió el cabello más saludable con el uso constante durante dos semanas.

Esa es exactamente la sensación que reproduce el Silky Glow Baked Bronzer 01 de KIKO Milano, una joya low cost que ha ganado espacio entre los imprescindibles del maquillaje diario. Y no, no necesitas vacaciones ni un filtro de Instagram para lograrlo. Por solo 11 euros en Amazon, este bronzer horneado reúne todo lo que buscamos: pigmento modulable, textura suave como terciopelo y un acabado natural que simula ese glow saludable y veraniego. Este producto se ha colado en tutoriales de TikTok, reseñas en YouTube y listas de favoritos en blogs de belleza por una razón clara: es bueno, bonito y barato. Pero además, tiene algo que los expertos valoran más que nunca: versatilidad y efecto realista. Tono universal: el tono 01 aporta ese dorado sutil, sin subtonos naranjas ni efecto “polvo sobre polvo”. Perfecto para pieles claras a medias, y modulable en pieles más profundas. Textura baked: no reseca, no marca poros ni genera parches. Se funde con la piel como un velo ligero. Acabado glow sin shimmer excesivo: es un glow “caro”. Ese que parece natural, que imita el rebote de la luz en tu piel. Más allá del color, lo que enamora es su fórmula horneada enriquecida con aceites emolientes, que hacen que aplicar este bronzer sea casi terapéutico. Se desliza fácil, se difumina sin esfuerzo y no acartona. ¿Tu piel necesita reset? Esta crema sueca es el botón de reinicio, ahora en Amazon     El acondicionador bifásico de 5 euros que te desenreda el pelo y la vida, está en Amazon     Seis euros, un milagro capilar y cero grasa: así actúa el No. 6 de Olaplex en Amazon No es casualidad que muchas comparen este producto con opciones mucho más caras, pero lo cierto es que el de KIKO Milano no intenta imitar a nadie: simplemente entiende lo que la piel necesita hoy. Mientras las fórmulas mates y pesadas del pasado han quedado atrás, ahora buscamos ese acabado tipo “clean girl makeup” o “effortless glow”, inspirado en modelos como Kaia Gerber o Lily Aldridge. Menos es más, pero tiene que verse bien. Este bronzer es parte de ese nuevo paradigma: lujo silencioso, con resultados visibles y un precio amable. ¿Vale la pena? Por 11 euros, absolutamente. Sobre todo si consideramos que se trata de un producto multitarea, que transforma la piel opaca en un rostro vibrante sin esfuerzo ni necesidad de técnica profesional. Además, al ser baked y pigmentado, te durará meses, incluso con uso frecuente. @mundistyle","SPR_COMBO[es]Hay algo casi cinematográfico en el verano: la piel besada por el sol, los hombros al descubierto, las mejillas ligeramente doradas como recién salidas de un barco en la costa amalfitana.

n15d1if,"  It depends how much risk you're willing to take. Your hair looks thick so that's a good start. This is what I would do, but I'm sure some won't agree - really, it all depends on your hair's overall health. So I'd start with color oops from the mids to the ends and follow with a deep conditioning mask for like 10-15 minutes after rinsing. I also always do a quick lamellar water rinse, too, after rinsing out bleach / dye. Let it air dry with some kind of leave-in conditioner / something moisturizing in it overnight. Next day: bleach mids to ends with 30 vol. and mix Olaplex 3 into your bleach solution. Saturate your hair. Mix bleach in small batches as you go so it doesn't lose its potency and move as fast as possible. Then watch and wait…. Rinse out all the bleach in lukewarm water - your hair is going to feel rough at this point: don't panic - and then mix purple conditioner (I use matrix) with a deep conditioning mask (I use Paul Mitchell or the Wella tub) and let it sit on there for like 10-15 mins. Rinse with cool water, lamellar water, rinse well. Hair should start looking more yellow than orange at this point, but don't be surprised (or worry) if you have to do some spot correcting following the same process. I've found doing it this way somehow makes my hair feel BETTER after each bleach session than it did before…. i also don't wash my hair frequently - not prone to greasy hair so I guess that helps - but I think this makes it inherently stronger. I'd see where you land after doing all of the above. From there I think you could try a Pulp Riot Semi-permanent dye (they have the best colors, IMO) to even out the yellow tone, if that's what you're looking to do. I get their dyes on Amazon; think I saw a color similar to your roots. Have fun with it! Once you get to where you want to be devote a few months at least to realllllly taking care of it; splurge a little on hair/scalp health products and “baby” it. Good luck!","It depends how much risk you're willing to take. Your hair looks thick so that's a good start.

Once a year, Amazon kicks off summer with savings across its site in over 35 categories, including electronics, kitchen, beauty, apparel, and back-to-school gear. This year marks the longest Prime Day with four days of shopping happening between July 8-11.

Be sure to look out for deals from popular brands like Ninja, Sony, and Too Faced (while supplies last). Psst... Check Out 12 Awesome River Tubing Spots Near NYC  ""We're excited for Prime members to experience our biggest Prime Day yet, with more days than ever and millions of deals from brands customers are eager to shop this season–from trending products and newly discovered brands to tried and true favorites,” said Carmen Nestares, vice president of North America Marketing and Prime Tech. If you would like to take advantage of the savings offered, you have to be a Prime member in advance of Prime Day. To sign up, visit the Amazon website, where you'll be prompted to enter information needed to set up your account. Amazon Prime membership costs $14.99 per month or $139 per year if you pay annually. Discounted options are available for young adults and qualifying government-assistance recipients. Membership allows for free shipping across the website, instead of the usual $35 minimum purchase required. Amazon Prime members also gain access to Prime Video , offering exclusive original content, like Dino Dex for the littles, and Pop Culture Jeopardy for the grownups, as well as old favorites like The Nanny . Amazon Music is another perk that allows subscribers to stream over 100 million songs, choose from the largest catalog of audiobooks from Audible , and listen to millions of podcast episodes. And if you're hungry, membership comes with free Grubhub+, with perks like $0 delivery fees on eligible orders, lower service fees, 5% credit back on pick-up orders, and other exclusive offers. But Let's Get Back to Prime Day  Before you start shopping, make a plan. Our philosophy when it comes to major shopping events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon Prime Day is to first consider what you need and make a list. If you don't have a plan, you could end up buying things you really don't need. Think about what you regularly shop for: snacks for the kids, batteries, cleaning supplies, etc. Then look around your house and see if you need bigger items like kitchen appliances or a new vacuum cleaner. Do the kids need anything? Outdoor toys, sports equipment, crafting kits, clothes, and back-to-school supplies come to mind. Maybe you have a wedding shower or birthday party that you need gifts for—this is a good time to score what they want at a savings. Load up your online shopping cart now for faster checkout on the big day. While the deals are too numerous to list, we've done some of the legwork for you and rounded up what you can expect this Prime Day, broken down by category, and what you can buy right now!

Check Out 12 Awesome River Tubing Spots Near NYC ""We're excited for Prime members to experience our biggest Prime Day yet, with more days than ever and millions of deals from brands customers are eager to shop this season–from trending products and newly discovered brands to tried and true favorites,” said Carmen Nestares, vice president of North America Marketing and Prime Tech. If you would like to take advantage of the savings offered, you have to be a Prime member in advance of Prime Day. To sign up, visit the Amazon website, where you'll be prompted to enter information needed to set up your account. Amazon Prime membership costs $14.99 per month or $139 per year if you pay annually. Discounted options are available for young adults and qualifying government-assistance recipients. Membership allows for free shipping across the website, instead of the usual $35 minimum purchase required. Amazon Prime members also gain access to Prime Video , offering exclusive original content, like Dino Dex for the littles, and Pop Culture Jeopardy for the grownups, as well as old favorites like The Nanny . Amazon Music is another perk that allows subscribers to stream over 100 million songs, choose from the largest catalog of audiobooks from Audible , and listen to millions of podcast episodes. And if you're hungry, membership comes with free Grubhub+, with perks like $0 delivery fees on eligible orders, lower service fees, 5% credit back on pick-up orders, and other exclusive offers. But Let's Get Back to Prime Day Before you start shopping, make a plan. Our philosophy when it comes to major shopping events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon Prime Day is to first consider what you need and make a list. If you don't have a plan, you could end up buying things you really don't need. Think about what you regularly shop for: snacks for the kids, batteries, cleaning supplies, etc. Then look around your house and see if you need bigger items like kitchen appliances or a new vacuum cleaner. Do the kids need anything? Outdoor toys, sports equipment, crafting kits, clothes, and back-to-school supplies come to mind. Maybe you have a wedding shower or birthday party that you need gifts for—this is a good time to score what they want at a savings. Load up your online shopping cart now for faster checkout on the big day. While the deals are too numerous to list, we've done some of the legwork for you and rounded up what you can expect this Prime Day, broken down by category, and what you can buy right now! Home Amazon always has great deals on its devices, and this year is no exception.

n16lyqu,"  I (23M) have had purely white platinum blonde before. Before I continue, OP I'm so glad you decided to go with getting a wig, and I'm so sorry about all the hate with these other people. From my experience, a wig is the best option, as when I finally achieved the white platinum hair, it was basically fried, and I had to refrain from doing anything to it for a while, and there was lots of broken pieces falling out when I'd wash my hair. Long story short, after I used lots of Olaplex on my hair, I decided to do black dye and have never looked back. Blonde, and especially white platinum is such a lovely color, but like others have said, it is so high maintenance and damaging. I may try again someday, but it's so important to keep the hair healthy.","I (23M) have had purely white platinum blonde before.

n1872a7,"  Hi, pro here. The ingredients are not the same. If you put a bit of store bought shampoo in your palm can you turn it upside down? It boils down to the ph balance on what makes hair products professional or not truly. I am not personally a fan of sulfate free products. I like the active cleaning agents/bubbles. However; I will say Pantene is the worst for your hair. It has wax in it. You can literally wax your floors with it. Long term use causes a waxy build up that I've personally cut off of peoples hair shaft. It's awful and can cause much bigger issues. I can wash someone's hair and tell if they use it (often). K18 and Olaplex can be good. However, too much protein can cause breakage and frizz, you don't need it that often unless it's very damaged. Using professional products correctly is the key. Some people aren't educated in the type of hair they have and actual products or frequency of use. I should also mention, there's a lot of fakes and expired products sold with really good packaging. Unless it's sold in a professional salon (not Amazon or a grocery store) there isn't a guarantee you're actually getting the correct product.

Lanzado en 2005 por Elizabeth Arden, con notas de kiwi, lichi, chocolate blanco y almizcle, este perfume es todo lo que el mainstream quiere enterrar: dulce, exagerado, hiperfemenino. Y, sin embargo, resiste. Hoy, por apenas 18 euros en Amazon, Fantasy es más que un perfume: es una declaración nostálgica, una botella de resistencia estética y una cápsula emocional para quienes crecimos entre hits pop y coreografías frente al espejo. Fantasy no es sutil, pero tampoco lo era Britney. En pleno auge del Y2K, cuando Paris Hilton era un mood y MySpace marcaba tu estatus social, Britney Spears lanzó Fantasy. Un perfume que parecía diseñado por una princesa adolescente con delirio de diva, y que terminó convirtiéndose en un icono cultural de la hiperglamourización. Su frasco rosa con cristales verdes parecía una pócima de Sailor Moon. Y su olor, una mezcla de cupcake en una noche de verano, resultaba tan escandalosamente dulce que ofendía a las narices “serias”. Pero eso era justo lo interesante. Fantasy no se disculpaba por su dulzura. La celebraba. Era un perfume que gritaba “soy femenina, soy pop, y no me interesa agradarte”. En un mundo que ahora finge preferir los perfumes unisex y neutros, Fantasy sobrevive como una reliquia aromática que se ha convertido, irónicamente, en una pieza de culto. El blush rosad de 3 euros que deja efecto Rare Beauty perfecto y sin gastar de más     El fijador de maquillaje viral de Amazon que revive delineadores y ahorra maquillaje     Rizos sin frizz, sin rigidez y con brillo: sí, existe, se llama Olaplex en Amazon Y no solo por el aroma, sino por lo que representa: la era Britney, la de los brillos, los excesos, el drama público y la constante presión mediática. Comprar Fantasy hoy no es solo adquirir un perfume barato, es hacer un guiño a una época en la que las popstars eran diosas vulnerables y los fans coreaban sus nombres como himnos generacionales. Su precio es otra ironía deliciosa: 18 euros por una botella que encapsula toda una estética, toda una actitud. Porque en un mercado donde los perfumes de autor cuestan más que un vuelo internacional, Fantasy sigue firme en su estante digital como diciendo: “no todo lo bueno tiene que ser caro, elitista o difícil de pronunciar”. Fantasy de Britney Spears es el perfume que nadie se atreve a decir en voz alta que sigue usando. Pero ahí está. Vibrante, dulce, ultra pop. Y en un mundo que exige madurez aromática como sinónimo de aburrimiento, llevar Fantasy es casi un acto de rebeldía estética. Así que sí, llévalo. Rocíalo.

Loved for its ability to dry and style the hair while inflicting no heat damage on our strands, it's become a cult hair tool for good reason. The tool has six attachments, including the flyaway attachment and extra-long curling barrels. This particular model is designed for people with hair on the longer side, and with 20% off, it's a rare deal that you'll probably want to take advantage of. Shop now Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Daily Hydrating Body Lotion 380ml $37.07 (was $55) at Amazon Elizabeth Arden's cult-famous Eight Hour Cream is an icon for a reason. So much so that Elizabeth Arden created an entire skincare line off the back of that orangey-peach-y tube of goodness. And yes, that includes body care, too.

If you've been thinking about a cosmetics change-up, now's your chance to do away with worn-out make-up brushes and dried-out mascaras.

We've been writing about sales – Amazon Prime Day included – for years, and can spot a great discount. My experience as a beauty expert (having tried and tested myriad products) means I can help you make informed decisions about the products you're considering snapping up in the sale. If you're on the lookout for a new blusher, hair oil or LED face mask, you know where to turn. Best early Amazon Prime Day beauty deals Elizabeth Arden eight hour cream skin protectant original for face and body: Was £31, now £15.39, Amazon.co.uk Elemis pro-collagen cleansing balm: Was £49, now £35.28, Amazon.co.uk Color Wow dreamcoat spray: Was £27, now £16, Amazon.co.uk Maybelline New York lash sensational sky high mascara: Was £12.99, now £7.49, Amazon.co.uk CeraVe hydrating cleanser for normal to dry skin: Was £12.50, now £8.75, Amazon.co.uk Elemis pro-collagen cleansing balm: Was £49, now £35.28, Amazon.co.uk The Elemis pro-collagen cleansing balm is about as luxurious as make-up removal gets, using a unique blend of algae and essential oils to restore and deeply nourish skin. Its heavenly scent offers a spa experience at home. Skincare expert has used it for years, and when reviewing it, she found it “a swift and efficacious way to remove make-up.” With 30 per cent off for Amazon Prime Day, now's a better time than ever to give your end-of-day cleanse an upgrade. I'm adding it to my basket now. Olaplex no.6 bond smoother: Was £28, now £19.50, Amazon.co.uk A great multi-purpose pick, Olaplex's no 6 formula works instantly. What's more, it can be applied to wet or dry hair and, as global IndyBest editor noted in her review, “it's a really great leave-in repairing treatment that made our locks feel a lot healthier and more manageable.” Reduced by more than £10 today, it's an easy solution for high-gloss, hydrated hair. Maybelline sky high lash sensation mascara: Was £12.99, now £7.49, Amazon.co.uk Maybelline's sky high lash sensational mascara is one of my favourite budget-friendly mascaras. But I'm not the only one to love it. In her review, IndyBest assistant editor found that her “eyelashes instantly looked lengthened and lifted, and most impressively, stayed that way all day.” This isn't the lowest-ever price it's been, but there's more than 40 per cent off. Color Wow dream coat: Was £32, now £16, Amazon.co.uk A non-negotiable step in my haircare regimen, Color Wow's dream coat anti-frizz treatment is a reliable way to keep my hair looking sleek, smooth and static-free. In my review, I loved that the formula kept my hair straight and added some serious shine and gloss, even after a day in the rain. Elizabeth Arden eight hour cream skin protectant original for face and body: Was £31, now £15.39, Amazon.co.uk A real handbag essential, I take my original eight hour cream everywhere with me, and use it for everything, be it dry cuticles or chapped lips. The balm smells like the inside of a luxury spa, and the texture is somewhere between a petroleum jelly and a thick cleansing balm, coming together to feel deeply nourishing.

Color Wow dream coat: Was £32, now £16, A non-negotiable step in my haircare regimen, Color Wow's dream coat anti-frizz treatment is a reliable way to keep my hair looking sleek, smooth and static-free. In my review, I loved that the formula kept my hair straight and added some serious shine and gloss, even after a day in the rain. Elizabeth Arden eight hour cream skin protectant original for face and body: Was £31, now £15.39, A real handbag essential, I take my original eight hour cream everywhere with me, and use it for everything, be it dry cuticles or chapped lips. The balm smells like the inside of a luxury spa, and the texture is somewhere between a petroleum jelly and a thick cleansing balm, coming together to feel deeply nourishing. If there's one product worth your money this Amazon Prime Day, it's this. Garnier ambre solair ultra-light sensitive sun protection face fluid SPF50+: Was £13, now £6.29, The best budget face SPF just got even cheaper thanks to the discount. The perfect pocket-sized sun cream is a great option for on-the-go application this summer. Our IndyBest tester trusted this SPF wholeheartedly as it protects from both UVB, UVA and long UVA rays. As for the “lightweight lotion” formula, it “instantly absorbs into the skin, while hyaluronic acid and vitamin E give that hit of hydration”, she found. Urban Decay all nighter make-up setting spray: Was £29.50, now £19.50, Setting spray is a must-have in the summer heat. But with so many options available, knowing where to start can be overwhelming. In her guide to the best setting sprays, Helen Wilson-Beevers loved that this all-nighter mist ensured her “make-up was sealed and secure from morning until evening,” and you can now save £10. Tan-Luxe the face self-tan drops: Was £36, now £20.77, If you like a year-round bronze, you're in luck: Tan-Luxe's face drops are reduced by 42 per cent for Amazon Prime Day. In her review, tanning expert Daisy Lester found these drops are the best for a deep tan and commended their skincare benefits, describing how they work “to strengthen the skin barrier, improve elasticity and firmness, and hydrate and soothe.” Weleda skin food: Was £8.95, now £5.65, Loved by the likes of Hailey Bieber and Victoria Beckham, this accessibly priced nourishing moisturiser is quite the skincare celebrity itself. It's thick and perfect for dry or rough patches and, our tester found in her pregnancy-safe skincare buys review, that Weleda skin food had “helped heal angry areas of dry, itchy and red skin,” as well as being, “an intensive redeemer that's nourished and restored a healthy barrier at an affordable price.”...","Discounts are dropping and skincare savings are rife – that's right, the Amazon Prime Day sale is here and with it comes the best beauty deals.

mov_B3160C60A7C091B068ED79747FF8D337,"  I've been waiting for an excuse to upgrade my ageing Kindle — and this Prime Day deal on the newest Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (16GB) has me ready to pounce. At £134.99 (down from £169.99), the price is spot on for summer, and everything about it feels like it was made for the kind of reading I plan to do on my upcoming holiday. I made a quiet resolution in January to read more this year — and, to my surprise, I've kept at it. But my trusty old Kindle (at least six years old, maybe more) has started to show its age: page turns feel sluggish, the screen's not as crisp as I'd like, and the battery barely makes it through a long weekend, let alone two solid weeks. This new Paperwhite seems to answer all of that and then some. Amazon calls it their fastest Kindle ever, with a next-gen 7-inch glare-free screen, 25% faster page turns, and weeks — not days — of battery life on a single USB-C charge. That's exactly what I want: to load it up with a hundred books, pop it in my hand luggage, and forget about charging it while I get lost in story after story. It's also waterproof, ultra-thin, and completely free of the social media distractions you get from tablets and phones. Add to that a warm light option for night reading and a massive Kindle Store library (plus Kindle Unlimited if you like), and it feels like a solid investment in my reading habit. Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (16GB) – Without Ads – Black Buy now for £134.99 at Amazon For anyone who's made — or wants to make — reading a bigger part of their life this summer, this is a deal worth grabbing while it lasts.

But my trusty old Kindle (at least six years old, maybe more) has started to show its age: page turns feel sluggish, the screen's not as crisp as I'd like, and the battery barely makes it through a long weekend, let alone two solid weeks. Read More This new Paperwhite seems to answer all of that and then some. Amazon calls it their fastest Kindle ever, with a next-gen 7-inch glare-free screen, 25% faster page turns, and weeks — not days — of battery life on a single USB-C charge. That's exactly what I want: to load it up with a hundred books, pop it in my hand luggage, and forget about charging it while I get lost in story after story. It's also waterproof, ultra-thin, and completely free of the social media distractions you get from tablets and phones. Add to that a warm light option for night reading and a massive Kindle Store library (plus Kindle Unlimited if you like), and it feels like a solid investment in my reading habit.

I've been waiting for an excuse to upgrade my ageing Kindle — and this Prime Day deal on the newest Amazon Kindle Paperwhite (16GB) has me ready to pounce. At £134.99 (down from £169.99), the price is spot on for summer, and everything about it feels like it was made for the kind of reading I plan to do on my upcoming holiday. I made a quiet resolution in January to read more this year — and, to my surprise, I've kept at it. But my trusty old Kindle (at least six years old, maybe more) has started to show its age: page turns feel sluggish, the screen's not as crisp as I'd like, and the battery barely makes it through a long weekend, let alone two solid weeks. This new Paperwhite seems to answer all of that and then some. Amazon calls it their fastest Kindle ever, with a next-gen 7-inch glare-free screen, 25% faster page turns, and weeks — not days — of battery life on a single USB-C charge. That's exactly what I want: to load it up with a hundred books, pop it in my hand luggage, and forget about charging it while I get lost in story after story. It's also waterproof, ultra-thin, and completely free of the social media distractions you get from tablets and phones. Add to that a warm light option for night reading and a massive Kindle Store library (plus Kindle Unlimited if you like), and it feels like a solid investment in my reading habit.

Amazon Prime Day is here, offering discounts on beauty and wellness items during the four-day sale, exclusive to Prime members. You can also find deals on tech, kitchen appliances, household essentials and more. I frequently cover shopping events like Prime Day, Black Friday and Cyber Monday as a writer for NBC Select, so I know how to find deals that are actually worth buying. I spent weeks combing through thousands of discounts to find the best Prime Day beauty deals — each one I recommend below is highly rated, at least 20% off and at its lowest price in at least three months. I'll frequently update this list throughout Prime Day. Selected.Our top picks You can use this teeth whitening kit — which is an NBC Select Wellness Award winner — to gently remove both old and new stains in as little as two weeks, according to the brand. Each pack comes with 18 treatments, all of which use enamel-safe hydrogen peroxide as the key whitening ingredient. Lowest Price Ever This Laneige lip mask is one of our absolute favorites — it has oils, butters and antioxidants to hydrate and protect your lips overnight. Our editors love that it keeps their lips feeling soft and moisturized, and say it's great for soothing irritation and dryness in the wintertime. You can use this viral shower oil to cleanse your skin in the shower and even replace your shaving cream. It has hydrating sweet almond oil, which gives it a vanilla-almond scent that NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio says is not too overpowering. Lowest Price Ever The Dyson Airwrap has three attachments that allow you to blow dry, curl and volumize your hair, according to the brand. It also has three airflow speeds and three heat settings, along with a cooling “cold shot” feature. Former “The Traitors” star Dorinda Medley told us she loves using these wipes to take off her makeup on the go. The disposable wipes are infused with micellar water to help you remove makeup, oil, bacteria and more without pulling or tugging, according to the brand. There are two packs, which have 25 wipes each. Olaplex's products are my favorites to use on wash days, and this kit has everything you need to get through an entire routine. It includes full sizes of the No.4 Bond Maintenance Shampoo, the No.5 Bond Maintenance Conditioner and the No.7 Bonding Oil, all of which hydrate, detangle and nourish hair by repairing damaged hair bonds, according to the brand. Sun Bum's Daily Face sunscreen made the top five on our 100 best sunscreens ranking, and this body spray version has the same broad-spectrum SPF 50 protection. It has vitamin E to moisturize your skin, plus it's noncomedogenic, which means it won't clog your pores. It's also water-resistant and reef-safe, making it ideal for a day at the beach. This body wash has glycerin to protect skin from dryness and provide moisture that lasts all day, according to the brand. The gentle, gel formula makes it great for sensitive skin. It's available in a variety of scents and has easy-to-use pump packaging. This moisturizer is fragrance-free, gentle and absorbs quickly into the skin. It has ceramides and niacinamide to hydrate skin, and layers well underneath makeup. A little also goes a long way with this moisturizer — NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin says that since she doesn't need to use a lot at a time, the tube tends to last a while. Malin uses the curly-hair version of this anti-frizz spray daily, and says it smooths out her curls while locking in definition. The heat-activated polymers in the spray protect your hair from moisture, preventing frizz and helping your hairstyle stay shiny, healthy and intact, according to the brand.

This award-winning, multi-tasking styling product has built a cult following for one reason: it delivers sleek, glassy, frizz-proof hair that lasts for days no matter the weather. What sets Dream Coat apart is that it's not just another anti-frizz spray.

How to use: Spray it generously and evenly onto damp hair, section by section. Do not apply other styling products before blow-drying, as they can interfere with the Dream Coat technology. Blow-dry smooth using tension to activate the formula. Once done, your hair will feel softer, look glossier, and stay sleek for days even in hot, humid, or rainy weather. If you've ever struggled with frizz or flat, dull strands that won't hold a sleek finish, Dream Coat could easily become your new go-to. It's a stylist secret that's now accessible for less during Prime Day so whether you're prepping for summer humidity or winter dryness, this spray will carry your style through every season flawlessly.

Now, as someone who was every shade of blonde at one stage, including platinum, I tended to rely on the iconic Olaplex brand to help keep my hair looking healthy, shiny and less frizzy at the ends. However, last year I decided to branch out with the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment that had attracted numerous TikTok videos and glowing reviews from shoppers who billed it as a ""miracle worker."" Read more: 'Sultry' Ghost perfume that 'suits all ages' now under £14 in Prime Day sale Read more: 'I tried a viral K-beauty serum for a week and my skin has never been glowier' That's not all, as for those who are obsessed with celebrity beauty secrets, this hair treatment is used by the current 'it' pop superstar of the moment Sabrina Carpenter, with the 'Espresso' hitmaker now a global ambassador for the Redken brand. To sweeten the deal even further, not only did I find this conditioner to be a ""lifesaver"" for damaged hair, but it's currently on offer for 32 percent less in the Amazon Prime Day sale, reduced from £26.40 to just £17.99 - and I am tempted to stock up for that price. For the beauty fans who are keen to take advantage of the Amazon deal, but aren't sure if the Bonding Treatment is right for them, I have provided below my full thoughts on when I first trialled it last year. ""Despite what you might think, I didn't run into this review with high expectations. I have used Olaplex in the past, which has helped the condition of my hair, but other products on the market don't tend to work well. Trust me, I have tried a lot. ""So, when I brought the Redken Leave-In Treatment on Amazon Prime Day, alongside the Pre-Shampoo Treatment, I decided to try and keep a level head. There's nothing worse than being disappointed, am I right? ""That being said, when I first popped this treatment on my damp ends, my first thought was that it seemed quite heavy, and I worried it would make my hair greasy. I couldn't have been more wrong, because like many reviews mentioned, a little goes a long way. ""I only needed just larger than a pea size amount to coat my lengths and ends evenly, and it melted in without weighing my fine hair down, unlike many other leave-in conditioners."" ""Considering many reviews and videos on TikTok say this treatment left their hair ""visibly healthier"" immediately, I was genuinely surprised to find myself agreeing with them. ""The first time I used the leave-in treatment, I used it alongside the pre-shampoo treatment and my hair felt smoother, with less tangles for my comb to snarl through. As soon as I blow dried my hair with the treatment in, I could notice that the broken, damaged ends of my hair were visibly smoother and a little shinier as well. ""Long gone were the gnarled looking straggly ends, and in their place was smooth, shiny hair that looked as though it had never been touched by any damage. Honestly, as someone who struggles with her fine hair, I was immediately surprised at the magic. ""After using the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment during my hair wash days in the week, I noticed that my hair doesn't look as damaged. ""Even though I've used it a few times now, the bottle still feels full, which is insane value for money. Considering my thin hair can go through products like crazy due to its weaker nature, I think that this treatment will be a staple that will save me cash in the long run. ""It's not just saving me money, as my hair genuinely feels softer and less fragile since I began using it. While it's no replacement for a good salon visit to cut off the dead ends, it's certainly a miracle worker in between appointments that has helped save my over processed hair to look, leaving it in much better condition."" Purchase my new go-to hair hero the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment for 32 percent less in the Amazon Prime Day event now. For a few alternatives worth trying out, I would still personally recommend the Olaplex No.6 Bond Smoother that is also on offer on Amazon for £19.80, down from £28.

So, when it comes to spotting a good deal, I like to think I have an eye for picking out the best options. This year's event kicked off at 00.01 today and will run until 23.59 on Friday 11 July. This sale is a little different to previous iterations of the popular shopping event, as it's the first time that the sale has run for more than 48 hours. This time around Amazon Prime Day will run for four days, with new deals (and price changes) popping up throughout the period. The sale is great for picking up all of your favourite brands at heavily discounted prices, but it's important to remember that deals don't always last for long, so acting quickly will help to avoid missing out on the best prices. Below, I've rounded up all my tried and tested shopping advice for landing the best deals and ensuring you're actually getting a good discount, as well as curating a list of all my top picks to buy during this year's sale event.

It's easy to assume that all deals shared during discounted shopping events offer good value, but as I've learnt from years of working as a shopping writer, that isn't always the case. To make sure you're getting a good deal, I'd recommend checking the price of sale items - you can do this using the free online price tracker CamelCamelCamel . To use the site, all you need to do is paste the link of the product you're interested in buying into the search bar and you'll be able to see its price history, including when it was last discounted - this will tell you whether a deal is actually offering a worthwhile saving. It's also important to check the prices that other retailers are offering for an item before buying it. Here's how to make sure you don't miss out on the best discounts If you've got your eye on a specific product or number of products, it's a good idea to make an Amazon wish list, so that you can shop directly from the list during the sale. Or, if you're worried about missing out on a deal, I'd recommend using the Amazon deals alert feature. This allows shoppers to get notifications for any items that have recently been searched or viewed on the website and in the app - to create a deal alert, all you need to do is head to the Amazon Prime Day event page to create deal alerts and set up push notifications for during the event. Other places to shop It's not just Amazon that's running a sale this week, a number of other UK retailers have also heavily discounted their products. If you're looking for a place to shop outside of Amazon Prime, these are all the other places offering reduced prices: Boots - Up to 50% off New Look - Up to 70% off Dunelm - Clearance sale Boden - Up to 60% off Very - Up to 30% off","I've been working as a shopping writer covering (and the various other Amazon deals that run throughout the rest of the year) for the past five years.

mov_624DC67854861C43F5020F4503350163,"  It feels like Black Friday in July with all the sales that are happening right now, and if you're one of the many that are looking at Amazon Prime Day deals, it might be a lot to go through. That's where we come in. We decided to have a little fun and showcase what our carts would look like if we had a budget of $500 to work with during Prime Day. As you can see below, the possibilities are endless. Spoiler alert: bulk candy is on the list. Check out what happened below when our team went window shopping during Prime Day. Francisco Here's what I'm adding to cart during Prime Day TheraGun Mini (3rd-Generation) - $187 Why: I'm training to run a marathon this year, and so having a massage gun has become paramount for pain relief and recovery. Not only that, but the TheraGun Mini is ultra-portable and TSA compliant, meaning I can bring it with me when I do some travel later this summer and run on the road. A note: The Therabody massage guns are HSA/FSA approved, so if you have an HSA account, you can use those funds towards this. Apple AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds - $160 Why: It's time for an upgrade from my current pair of AirPods, and these are currently seeing their lowest price of the year. While it's still not at its lowest price ever (that was back on Black Friday 2024), the deal is good enough and fits in my budget. Plus, my original AirPods are an older model, so I'm excited for a newer model. A note: If you add AppleCare+, it will be an extra $29 to your order. Bissell Crosswave Turbo wet dry vacuum - $130 Why: A cordless stick vacuum is pretty pricey, and I do still need a mop to pick up any messes and spills on my floors. This wet dry vacuum covers everything I need in one device, for a fraction of the cost of a Dyson cordless vacuum. Arm & Hammer Power Sheets box - $10 Why: Tackle up to 100 loads for $10? Need I say more? I'll say one more thing. Much easier to store away than a large bottle of liquid detergent, and takes away the worry of detergent spills too. Affresh washing machine cleaner - $10 Why: A six-month supply of tablets to clean my washing machine and keep it running properly. Parting with an Alexander Hamilton is a good trade, I think. Related video above: Top July Sales at Target, Walmart, and Amazon: Save Big This Summer Xin Xin Here's what I'm buying on Amazon Prime Day: Shark AI Ultra Voice Control Robot Vacuum - $297.99 Why: Who would have thought a miniature pinscher and a basset hound could shed this much? It seems like a never-ending, daily task to clean up dog hair everywhere on the floor. So this year, I've decided to cave in and get a robot vacuum. I am especially excited that the robot vacuum will get to hard-to-reach places, such as under the bed. Olaplex No. 7 Bonding Oil - $21 Why: I've been using Olaplex's No. 3 pre-wash hair conditioner for years, ever since I started bleaching my hair. It's done a great job at keeping it healthy even after the harsh bleaching treatments. So I've always wanted to try the No. 7 bonding oil as well. This is a great time to try a new product as I can save 30% as part of Amazon's Prime Day deals. COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence - $15.99 Why: With over 88,000 reviews and a 4.5-star rating, this internet viral skincare product promises to reduce dullness and soothe dehydrated skin.

That's where we come in. We decided to have a little fun and showcase what our carts would look like if we had a budget of $500 to work with during Prime Day. As you can see below, the possibilities are endless. Spoiler alert: bulk candy is on the list. Check out what happened below when our team went window shopping during Prime Day. Francisco Here's what I'm adding to cart during Prime Day TheraGun Mini (3rd-Generation) - $187 Why: I'm training to run a marathon this year, and so having a massage gun has become paramount for pain relief and recovery. Not only that, but the TheraGun Mini is ultra-portable and TSA compliant, meaning I can bring it with me when I do some travel later this summer and run on the road. A note: The Therabody massage guns are HSA/FSA approved, so if you have an HSA account, you can use those funds towards this. Apple AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds - $160 Why: It's time for an upgrade from my current pair of AirPods, and these are currently seeing their lowest price of the year. While it's still not at its lowest price ever (that was back on Black Friday 2024), the deal is good enough and fits in my budget. Plus, my original AirPods are an older model, so I'm excited for a newer model. A note: If you add AppleCare+, it will be an extra $29 to your order. Bissell Crosswave Turbo wet dry vacuum - $130 Why: A cordless stick vacuum is pretty pricey, and I do still need a mop to pick up any messes and spills on my floors. This wet dry vacuum covers everything I need in one device, for a fraction of the cost of a Dyson cordless vacuum. Arm & Hammer Power Sheets box - $10 Why: Tackle up to 100 loads for $10? Need I say more? I'll say one more thing. Much easier to store away than a large bottle of liquid detergent, and takes away the worry of detergent spills too. Affresh washing machine cleaner - $10 Why: A six-month supply of tablets to clean my washing machine and keep it running properly. Parting with an Alexander Hamilton is a good trade, I think. Related video above: Top July Sales at Target, Walmart, and Amazon: Save Big This Summer Xin Xin Here's what I'm buying on Amazon Prime Day: Shark AI Ultra Voice Control Robot Vacuum - $297.99 Why: Who would have thought a miniature pinscher and a basset hound could shed this much? It seems like a never-ending, daily task to clean up dog hair everywhere on the floor. So this year, I've decided to cave in and get a robot vacuum. I am especially excited that the robot vacuum will get to hard-to-reach places, such as under the bed. Olaplex No. 7 Bonding Oil - $21 Why: I've been using Olaplex's No. 3 pre-wash hair conditioner for years, ever since I started bleaching my hair. It's done a great job at keeping it healthy even after the harsh bleaching treatments. So I've always wanted to try the No. 7 bonding oil as well. This is a great time to try a new product as I can save 30% as part of Amazon's Prime Day deals. COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence - $15.99 Why: With over 88,000 reviews and a 4.5-star rating, this internet viral skincare product promises to reduce dullness and soothe dehydrated skin.

However, all hope isn't lost quite yet: It possible to repair damaged hair, making it look vibrant and healthy again, if you have the right products. One of the top-recommended hair repair treatments is Olaplex No. 3 Hair Perfector, a pre-wash treatment that you leave in for several minutes before showering. This hair product has legions of fans, and it's currently available at its lowest price of the year. If you're struggling with dried, fried, or otherwise damaged hair, this is one Amazon Prime Day deal you won't want to miss. The cult-favorite Olaplex No. 3 is currently 30% off, bringing its price down to just $21. Thousands of reviewers — myself included — swear that this formula is the key to reviving damaged hair, and if you've been wanting to try it out for yourself, there's no better time to grab a bottle (or two!) . Olaplex No. 3 is clinically proven to help reverse hair damage after just a single use, helping to improve your hair's strength, texture, and appearance. $21 at Amazon Why is this a good deal? Olaplex products work phenomenally, but they are definitely a splurge. The No. 3 formula typically retails for $30 for a 3.3-ounce bottle, and it rarely goes on sale. For Prime Day, this beloved hair repair treatment is marked down 30%, bringing its price to just $21 — the lowest we've seen all year. Why do I need this? If your hair is looking dull or frizzy due to damage, Olaplex No. 3 is arguably the best way to restore it. The product is designed to be put in damp hair, and you let it soak in for up to 10 minutes before rinsing it out. (Many people choose to apply it before their shower, then wash their hair as usual.) In just a few minutes, the formula is able to strengthen your hair — the brand explains that it repairs damage on a molecular level by rebuilding the disulfide bonds that give hair its strength. This will make your hair look smoother and less textured, and it should also be easier to detangle after washing. The product also helps to prevent future breakage, and you'll start seeing results after the very first use. No. 3 can be used on all types of hair, and it only needs to be applied once a week. What reviewers say Olaplex No. 3 has been clinically tested, but it also has thousands of avid fans who swear by the formula. In fact, Amazon says that more than 100,000 shoppers have purchased the hair treatment multiple times — so you know it works! ✅ Pros If you're skeptical about how well Olaplex No. 3 works, the glowing reviews will definitely put your worries to rest: “My hair? Fried. Frizzed. Emotionally unstable. It had seen things — bleach, box dye, questionable heat styling decisions — and it was holding a grudge,” writes one ecstatic reviewer. “Enter this little miracle worker. Olaplex No. 3 is worth the hype! It's a bond-builder, which sounds like something from a superhero movie, and honestly, that's the energy it brings. This is the closest thing to an apology your strands will ever get from you.” Older reviewers also love the formula, saying it makes their hair look much younger and healthier: “It is the fountain of youth for your hair,” explains a self-described skeptic. “Mine now looks and feels as good as it did over 20 years ago. Thick. Shiny. Soft. Bouncy. Gorgeous.” Many reviewers also say this product comes recommended by their hairdressers: “My hair is overly dry, brittle, and unable to manage because of the damage from highlighting,” says another repeat buyer. “I was absolutely hating my hair, to tears. My hairdresser suggested that I try this. It has made all the difference. My hair is shiny, feels healthier, and I have confidence again.” ⚠️ Cons One of the biggest downsides of this product is that it comes in a small 3.3-ounce bottle, and you may go through it quickly if you have long or thick hair: “This worked well when using it with Olaplex No. 4 and 5, but the bottle is so small, I only got four uses out of it,” says another reviewer....","If you regularly dye, blow dry, straighten, or curl your hair, chances are that your locks are slightly (or maybe more than slightly) damaged.

mov_44391FCDD54C3D9908C8C88517D365AF,"  The Independent's journalism is supported by our readers. When you purchase through links on our site, we may earn commission. Why trust us? Here's everything you need to know about the annual summer sale When did Amazon Prime Day 2024 start in the US? Amazon Prime Day is underway. And, as a shopping editor who has covered the retailer's sales for more than five years, it's safe to say I know how to spot a good deal from a dud. I'd always recommend using price comparison tools to make sure you're getting the best possible price, but I can confidently say some of the best deals see big-ticket products plummet to their lowest-ever price. Apple's AirPods Pro 2, for example, have been reduced by $100 to just $149, making them cheaper than their Black Friday price. And both Dyson's top-rated air purifier and Yeti's tumbler are now cheaper than ever. There are also impressive savings on Ninja air fryers, robot vacuums, CeraVe beauty products, and gaming devices. For the first ever year, the summer sale is running for four full days, but when will it end? Keep scrolling for answers to all of your burning questions, as well as a handpicked selection of the best deals across tech, appliances, beauty, and more. When did Amazon Prime Day 2024 start in the US? Amazon kicked off its Prime Day sale on July 8 at midnight. For the first year, the Amazon Prime Day sale will run for four days. Amazon Prime Day ends on July 11. From experience, the deals tend to stay the same for the duration of the event. But big-ticket items such as AirPods or games consoles do have a tendency to sell out before the end of the sales event. Is Prime Day only for Prime members? Yes, Prime Day is a celebration of Amazon's Prime members, so you'll actually need to be a Prime member to secure all the deals. Amazon Prime costs $14.99 per month or $139 per year. But there is a way around paying for the subscription. If you're not already a Prime member, you might be eligible for a free 30-day trial of Prime. It's only available to Amazon customers who have never been a Prime member before or haven't been a Prime member in the last 12 months. If you're between the ages of 18 and 22, you can also get an even longer six-month free trial, as well as half-price memberships, meaning you'll pay just $7.49 instead of $14.99 per month.

I have long hair and use one to cut down on breakage and my hair is so much less tangled in the morning,. It's actually pretty surprising.

— CeraVe 洗面奶
我和队友常年只用这家洗面奶，脸和身体都能用。 一年大概消耗3–4瓶。 按打折轮着囤。 绿色透明瓶（cream-to-foam）最滋润，适合干皮和中性皮，日常只涂防晒可不用单独卸妆。 透明蓝瓶（SA）没感觉到去角质，胜在清爽。 蓝绿色瓶（Foaming Cleanser）是油皮队友最爱，我干皮觉得略拔干，用完不及时护肤会紧绷。 — CeraVe 防晒霜
CeraVe之前有一款带防晒值的日霜我踩雷严重，从此对它家防晒敬而远之。 直到有天在Ulta看到一个女生直接拿5瓶，我试了试这个。 这款超轻薄、不糊眼、不泛白，像普通乳液一样。 SPF30对秋冬日常通勤或居家完全够用。 我干皮、队友油皮都爱，现在逢折必囤，不懂为啥这款还没火。 — CeraVe 乳液
全家常备，从头涂到脚。 比cream和intensive lotion好吸收，不黏。 只有冬天风大时才用cream厚涂急救，第二天皮肤就软了很多。 — Differin 0.1% A酸
系里成分党巴西姐姐推荐。 我混干皮，从CeraVe紫瓶过渡来毫无不适。 质地是水乳状凝胶，一泵全脸刚好，吸收快但略绷，我会叠Vichy精华+乳液。 官方说45g能用3个月，我感觉每天晚上用，大概2个月就用完，折扣太好我一次性囤了3支。 — Timeless 20% 维C（浅黄色瓶）
还是那位巴西姐姐推荐。 我原来用CeraVe入门款，但这瓶20%更高浓度，也不刺激，泵装不接触空气，不会变黄，心理使用感更好。 这次趁打折囤了3瓶。 — Vichy 保湿精华
常年囤货。 质地清透像水，叠面霜不卡。 皮肤喝饱水的感觉，换季泛红靠它维稳很快。 — Olaplex No. 4C 洗发水
队友最爱，他头发偏油但这瓶可以清得很干净，控油不干涩，用量极省，一瓶能用大半年。 他觉得味道特别高级，我感觉其实就是清新花香...
— L'Oréal Elvive Total Repair 5 洗护
我的最爱，直接设成amazon autoship。 味道有点像VS的Bombshell。 修复力强，第一次见洗完能直接出高颅顶的，头发蓬松挺立。 小红书居然很少人推荐。 #amazon好物 #amazon折扣 #primeday",SPR_COMBO[zh]趁着Amazon Prime Day折扣把接下来半年要用的洗护品大部分囤齐了。 下面是我的囤货总结： — CeraVe 洗面奶 我和队友常年只用这家洗面奶，脸和身体都能用。 一年大概消耗3–4瓶。 按打折轮着囤。 绿色透明瓶（cream-to-foam）最滋润，适合干皮和中性皮，日常只涂防晒可不用单独卸妆。 透明蓝瓶（SA）没感觉到去角质，胜在清爽。 蓝绿色瓶（Foaming Cleanser）是油皮队友最爱，我干皮觉得略拔干，用完不及时护肤会紧绷。 — CeraVe 防晒霜 CeraVe之前有一款带防晒值的日霜我踩雷严重，从此对它家防晒敬而远之。 直到有天在Ulta看到一个女生直接拿5瓶，我试了试这个。 这款超轻薄、不糊眼、不泛白，像普通乳液一样。 SPF30对秋冬日常通勤或居家完全够用。 我干皮、队友油皮都爱，现在逢折必囤，不懂为啥这款还没火。 — CeraVe 乳液 全家常备，从头涂到脚。 比cream和intensive lotion好吸收，不黏。 只有冬天风大时才用cream厚涂急救，第二天皮肤就软了很多。 — Differin 0.1% A酸 系里成分党巴西姐姐推荐。 我混干皮，从CeraVe紫瓶过渡来毫无不适。 质地是水乳状凝胶，一泵全脸刚好，吸收快但略绷，我会叠Vichy精华+乳液。 官方说45g能用3个月，我感觉每天晚上用，大概2个月就用完，折扣太好我一次性囤了3支。 — Timeless 20% 维C（浅黄色瓶） 还是那位巴西姐姐推荐。 我原来用CeraVe入门款，但这瓶20%更高浓度，也不刺激，泵装不接触空气，不会变黄，心理使用感更好。 这次趁打折囤了3瓶。 — Vichy 保湿精华 常年囤货。 质地清透像水，叠面霜不卡。 皮肤喝饱水的感觉，换季泛红靠它维稳很快。 — Olaplex No. 4C 洗发水 队友最爱，他头发偏油但这瓶可以清得很干净，控油不干涩，用量极省，一瓶能用大半年。 他觉得味道特别高级，我感觉其实就是清新花香... — L'Oréal Elvive Total Repair 5 洗护 我的最爱，直接设成amazon autoship。 味道有点像VS的Bombshell。 修复力强，第一次见洗完能直接出高颅顶的，头发蓬松挺立。 小红书居然很少人推荐。,2025-07-09 02:26:56,zh,WEB,amazon好物|amazon折扣|primeday,,,a099647d6dc450a7ed7bdd95c5b5b737,,False,1,False,,Medium,False,"This appears to be a genuine, detailed user review of multiple personal care products, including a brief mention of Olaplex No. 4C shampoo.

There are more deals than you could ever begin to look through on your own...so that's where we come in. We waded through the mountains of bargains for you and found some of the best deals in every category. FYI — deals move *fast*. We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. 40% off (that's $100 off, an all-new lowest price ever!) the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro. With active noise cancellation, spatial audio, three silicone tips for customized fit, and over 24 hours of listening time with the included case, the AirPods Pro 2 give you a *ton* of bang for your buck. Promising review: ""Nothing compares. The noise canceling is superior. I fly a lot on the airlines and I don't have to hear screaming babies anymore. I hit the noise canceling and watch my movie or listen to my music. These are the best earphones I've ever had."" —Patrice Price: $149 (originally $249 (and currently $249 at Apple); typically $189.99 at Amazon) — and shop all the Apple deals here AirPods 4 are also a new lowest price ever — 34% off with noise cancellation (down to $119), 31% off without (down to $89). 2. 60% off (the lowest price ever!) the TikTok-viral TirTir cushion foundation that offers 72 hours of flawless wear, blending seamlessly to hide redness, blemishes, and under-eye bags. It has buildable coverage, perfect for a natural look or full glam. Plus, it's packed with hibiscus and red propolis extracts for a boost in skin elasticity. And to top it all off, its oval-shaped puff can reach every little corner of your face. Check out this TikTok of Mikayla Nogueira's review of this foundation. Promising review: ""OMG! I cannot believe how amazing this foundation is! Please do not listen to the bad comments, run and buy it and test it yourself! I honestly did not order this sooner because of the bad reviews, but decided to give it a try. I have tried from the most expensive foundations and nothing compares to this one! I had people stop me and ask me what I was wearing. I love the fact that it's all in one simple compact and easy to travel with. I no longer need a brush nor a Beautyblender.

mov_3F002AECF3E70C76C9A4DF0AAAABDDD8,"  Amazon Prime Day is a four-day extravaganza this year, and it kicked off with a bang yesterday. Amazon slashed prices across all its departments, and we found all-time low prices on many popular products, ranging from bestselling tech to luxury haircare. We weren't the only ones impressed by this year's deals, either — AOL readers did some savvy shopping yesterday, snatching up the best sales as soon as they dropped. Curious about what fellow shoppers are adding to their carts? Perhaps unsurprisingly, people purchased Apple AirPods by the dozen — these top-rated earbuds only go on sale a few times a year, and for Prime Day, they're at their lowest price ! So, it's really a deal you won't want to miss. Other items that flew off the shelves include my personal favorite handheld vacuum, for less than $60 for Prime Day, as well as a reader-favorite electric spin scrubber, $8 bath mat, and these budget-friendly solar lights for your backyard. Quick OverviewSee 20 more Here's the good news: All of these top-selling items are still marked down for Day 2 of Amazon's summer savings event, and we're guessing that they'll be available all week long, assuming they don't sell out. Most of these deals are Prime exclusives, which means you do need an Amazon Prime account to access the sale price. However, you can easily sign up for a 30-day free Prime trial, which will allow you to shop all the best discounts. If you're ready to start shopping, the following are the most popular items that AOL readers bought on Prime Day yesterday. We always recommend waiting until Prime Day if you're in the market for AirPods, and we expected them to be marked down to around $160 for the sale. So imagine our surprise when Apple dropped the price of these popular earbuds to just $140! At 40% off, this is the lowest price we've ever seen for these fan-favorite noise-cancelling headphones, and many of our readers are taking advantage of the steep discount. Save $100 $149 at Amazon BLACK+DECKER I'm a huge fan of this handheld vacuum — I've tested many in my career, and this one is tops in terms of both performance and value. At just $59, it's an absolute steal, and I'm happy to see that AOL readers agree with my assessment. $59 at Amazon Once again, Apple is offering higher-than-normal discounts for Prime Day. If you spot AirTags under $80, you've found a great deal, and for Prime Day, this four-pack of the little trackers is actually under $70. AirTags are ideal for attaching to your keys, wallet, suitcase, or even pet, as they allow you to quickly track down lost items from your phone, and this is an unbeatable price for a set of the handy gadgets. $65 at Amazon Our readers buy these electric scrubbers in droves every time they're on sale, so we're not surprised that their Prime Day price has attracted lots of shoppers. The tool's battery-powered brushhead makes cleaning the shower and tub a breeze, and it will save your knees and back. It also comes with several attachments so you can clean virtually any surface in your home. $32 at Amazon No one wants to spend too much on a bath mat, but for just $8, this chenille mat is a great Prime Day buy for your bathroom. It's plush and absorbent underfoot, and its rubber backing helps prevent slipping. Our readers have been loving it, and we think you will, too. Save $7 with coupon$8 at Amazon We knew Crest Whitestrips would be on sale for Prime Day, but we didn't expect such a steep discount! These strips are one of the easiest and most effective options for whitening your teeth at home — they use hydrogen peroxide to help remove mild to moderate stains, and they're gentle on your enamel while still delivering visible results. Save $22 with coupon$28 at Amazon This two-pack of solar lights was a sleeper hit among AOL readers, and they're the perfect inexpensive option for jazzing up your outdoor living space in time for summer. They have a 270-degree wide lighting angle and dozens of LED diodes for maximum brightness, and you can grab a two-pack for just $10 right now. $10 at Amazon While not the most exciting purchase, I'd argue that a good meat thermometer is an essential for every kitchen — after all, you don't want to be serving your family over- or under-cooked meat! This instant-read thermometer is a popular pick among AOL shoppers this Prime Day, and you're sure to get plenty of use out of it for grilling season. $12 at Amazon Rubbermaid Here's another kitchen essential that our readers have been snatching up. The Rubbermaid Brilliance line of food storage containers is one of the best options out there, and virtually all the different sizes and styles are on sale for Prime Day. So if your cabinet is a mess of mismatched, stained, or cracked containers, now's the time to upgrade. $18 at Amazon If you have damaged hair or split ends, Olaplex No. 3 is a game-changer — I've personally used it and promise that it works wonders. This beloved product actually helps to reverse hair damage, and it will leave your locks softer and stronger after just one use. Plus, at just $21, there's no better time to grab a bottle to try for yourself. $21 at Amazon...","Amazon Prime Day is a four-day extravaganza this year, and it kicked off with a bang yesterday.

mov_2C3429D3C557F45BEAFFF0B3977F3634,"  SPR_COMBO[es]La sensualidad ha evolucionado. Ya no necesita gritar, ni inundar el aire a metros de distancia. En un mundo saturado de estímulos, el verdadero lujo es discreto, íntimo, casi secreto. El perfume sólido de Lalique lo sabe bien: una joya encapsulada en un formato inesperado, sofisticado, y hoy, por solo 39 euros en Amazon por Prime Day, se convierte en el arma silenciosa de quienes prefieren seducir sin estruendo. Los perfumes sólidos no son nuevos, pero Lalique convierte esta categoría en arte. Inspirado en la tradición de la perfumería francesa y en el legado de su fundador, el artista René Lalique, este perfume es una pieza de colección que desafía la idea convencional de lo olfativo. No hay frasco de vidrio ni vaporizador; hay un estuche elegante, compacto, que se desliza como un secreto en la palma de la mano o dentro de un clutch de noche. ¿El aroma? Íntimo, envolvente, con esa firma floral-amaderada que no busca complacer a todos, sino acompañarte de cerca. Porque el perfume sólido no se lleva para que los demás lo noten, se lleva para que tú lo sientas. Es piel, es memoria, es ritual. Su textura cremosa permite aplicar justo donde debe: en los puntos de pulso, donde el calor del cuerpo lo activa y lo vuelve parte de ti. En muñecas, cuello, clavículas… lugares que no se eligen al azar, sino por deseo. Y al ser sólido, es perfecto para viajar, para llevar en la bolsa, para reaplicar sin llamar la atención. Sin derrames, sin riesgos. Solo elegancia pura. El fijador de maquillaje viral de Amazon que revive delineadores y ahorra maquillaje     Rizos sin frizz, sin rigidez y con brillo: sí, existe, se llama Olaplex en Amazon     Glow overnight: el secreto de las influencers de belleza para piel radiante está en Amazon Lalique no hace concesiones. Cada detalle del packaging, del acabado, del diseño, remite a la herencia de una maison que entiende el lujo como algo que se hereda, se siente y se respeta. En ese contexto, 39 euros por este perfume sólido no es un gasto: es una inversión en una experiencia sensorial que puedes tocar y que nadie más tiene que ver. Además, estamos hablando de Prime Day. Un evento donde abunda lo práctico y lo masivo, pero rara vez aparecen objetos que, como este, invitan a la contemplación y al hedonismo personal. Si hay un momento para darte ese lujo, es este. Por eso, si quieres llevar contigo algo más que una fragancia—un símbolo de estilo, de discreción y de belleza contenida—este perfume sólido de Lalique está esperando. Y durante el Prime Day, por 39 euros, se vuelve alcanzable sin perder ni una gota de su mística. @mundistyle","SPR_COMBO[es]La sensualidad ha evolucionado.

Uno de ellos es ver tus manos impecables, con un esmalte que no se quiebra al segundo café ni desaparece al lavar platos. El OPI Gel con color, esmalte en gel para uñas, una de las fórmulas más profesionales del mercado, ahora está en oferta por solo 20 euros en Amazon gracias al Prime Day. Un precio más que justo por una manicura que dura semanas, brilla como recién hecha y te ahorra citas innecesarias en el salón. OPI no es cualquier marca. Es un nombre que suena en pasarelas, sets de cine y manos de celebridades. Pero más allá de lo aspiracional, ha construido su reputación en una fórmula real: larga duración, pigmentación intensa y un acabado gel que compite con el de los mejores salones profesionales. Su línea GelColor, en particular, es la joya del portafolio, diseñada para brindar ese efecto “recién pintado” por hasta tres semanas. Y ahora, por solo 20 euros, puedes tener ese resultado sin salir de casa. En un mundo donde el tiempo escasea y las prioridades cambian, la manicura en gel casera es un nuevo acto de autonomía. Ya no es solo estética: es una declaración. Te cuidas, te ves bien y lo haces a tu manera. El secreto de este esmalte está en su tecnología de gel semipermanente, que cura bajo lámpara LED y sella el color con un brillo que no se opaca con los días. No hay retoque constante, ni esquinas despostilladas. El color permanece intacto, como si el tiempo no pasara. Y eso, en términos beauty, es casi un superpoder. Seis euros, un milagro capilar y cero grasa: así actúa el No. 6 de Olaplex en Amazon     Cuidado minimalista y efectivo: la crema que los dermatólogos no dejan de recomendar     Protección 360º y cero dramas: así es cuidar la piel atópica bajo el sol, gracias Amazon Además, su paleta de tonos no se queda en lo básico. Desde los nudes sofisticados tipo “your nails but better” hasta rojos icónicos y tonos modernos con carácter, cada color parece tener historia y actitud. Porque en OPI, elegir un tono es también elegir un estado de ánimo. Si eres de las que valora el acabado de salón pero también quiere libertad y practicidad, este esmalte es para ti. Solo necesitas una base, una lámpara LED (que hoy puedes encontrar por menos de lo que cuesta una visita al nail bar) y un poco de paciencia para aplicar en capas finas. El resultado: uñas dignas de portada de revista, hechas por ti. Este Prime Day no es solo una oportunidad para renovar gadgets. Es una invitación a apostar por ti y por esos pequeños gestos de poder personal que elevan tu día a día. El OPI GelColor no es solo un esmalte: es una herramienta de belleza y empoderamiento en clave contemporánea. Por 20 euros, te llevas semanas de brillo profesional, sin prisas, sin citas, sin salir de casa. Y eso, honestamente, vale más de lo que cuesta. @mundistyle","SPR_COMBO[es]Hay pequeños lujos que cambian toda la narrativa de tu rutina.

n2cngus,"  If you're not using leave in conditioner, you're skipping a very important step in the hair process. In addition it's very possible that your hair just doesn't like the specific shampoo and conditioner that you are using. Here's my full routine: > 🫧 Shampoo & Conditioner: Invest in a high-quality shampoo and conditioner, preferably those enriched with natural oils. These oils can penetrate the scalp and nourish the hair follicles, promoting healthy growth from the roots. However, avoid products containing coconut oil, as it can clog pores and potentially hinder hair growth > 🧴Deep Conditioner: any type will work. Start by dampening your hair, then apply the deep conditioner and cover your hair with a plastic cap. Follow this with a heated cap, which you can easily find on Amazon. These caps are microwaveable and help open up the hair cuticle and pores, allowing the nutrients to penetrate more effectively. This process also softens the hair and adds much-needed moisture, making it more manageable and less prone to tangling. Deep conditioning is a must. > 🪼Protein Treatment:  once a week or every two weeks can help keep your hair strong and resilient. However, be careful not to overdo it, as too much protein can lead to buildup and brittleness. An affordable and effective option is the Elizavecca brand. > 🧴Leave-In Conditioner: This is a must-have in any hair care routine, as it helps protect your hair from heat damage. Despite common misconceptions, leave-in conditioner isn't just for curly hair—any hair type can benefit from it. It helps retain moisture and is typically applied from the mid-lengths to the ends of your hair. This is typically applied when hair is wet and brushed after the shower. > 🛢️ Oil Your Hair – Using the right oils can make a big difference in your hair health. There are oils specifically for the scalp and others meant for the mid-lengths to ends. For the scalp, opt for nourishing oils like rosemary oil, pumpkin seed oil, peppermint oil, or Jamaican black castor oil—these can help stimulate growth and improve scalp health. For the mid-lengths to ends, Olaplex oil is an excellent choice. It's lightweight, effective, and won't leave behind any greasy residue. > 💆🏻‍♀️ Scalp Massage: Each night, take a small amount of one of the oils mentioned earlier, dab it onto your fingertips, and gently massage it into your scalp. This helps stimulate the hair follicles, which can promote healthy hair growth. Also, I want you to be aware that clarifying does remove buildup however if you are not using silicone then there's no reason for you to use a clarifying shampoo. I would get shampoos and conditioner that are based on moisture that are more natural!","If you're not using leave in conditioner, you're skipping a very important step in the hair process.

Kiehls Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil 5.9 oz $28.50$38.0025% offBuy Now On Amazon A gentle but effective cleansing oil. The word oil can be triggering to some, especially those with oily skin. Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil is a cleanser you can trust, with an affordable price tag to boot. It's one you'll want to add to your arsenal for numerous reasons. This formula is packed with botanical oils that work gently to remove dirt, makeup and grime from the epidermis without leaving a greasy residue. Say hello to soft and supple skin. Squalane beefs up the formula by replenishing the skin's barrier. Simply lather a few pumps of the product onto the face, working in circular motions before washing away with water. Simple as that. T3 AireLuxe Professional Ionic Hair Dryer and Brush Set $142.49$209.9932% offBuy Now on amazon A hair dryer and two brush set. Three products for the price of one can never be wrong. Right now, you can get T3's AireLuxe Professional Ionic Hair Dryer along with a brush set for just $142.49. That's 32% off the bundle's original price. The included dryer is fitted with a custom-engineered fan that dries the hair 2x faster, while retaining natural moisture so you won't be left with dry or brittle locks. Both brushes are meant for styling while drying, working volume into your follicles without tugging or pulling. We can see these three pieces making a great gift for those just beginning their hair styling journey. Urban Decay All-Over Liquid Highlighter & Setting Spray Bundle $59.20$70.0015% offBuy Now On Amazon A duo set with a setting spray and a liquid highlighter.

All Nighter is a cult favorite that keeps makeup fresh and hydrated for up to 16 hours. Face Bond Luminizer is a liquid highlighter of sorts that works to add a luminous shine when applied to the high points of the face. The glitzy drops can also be mixed into your favorite foundations to create a more luminous finish. The stand-out combo results in a glossy and long-wearing makeup look that will have you turning heads. Ouai St. Barts Body Cleanser Travel Size $11.20$14.0020% offBuy Now On Amazon A foaming body wash. Ouai is best known for their haircare product; however, they also cater to skincare needs. The brand's St. Barts Foaming Body Wash is an underrated hit, and it's currently on sale for $11.20.

The foaming wash is scented with Ouai's St. Barts fragrance, which features notes of dragon fruit, orange blossom, tuberose and musk that evoke vacations sat beneath a blooming tropical tree.

n2j9azq,"  Don't listen to people - listen to me-  what you actually need to ask your hairdresser for is high lift tint. It will raise your colour maybe to something more caramel or lighter but do not use bleach!!! They will say oh we will use Olaplex or whatever story but it will destroy your hair. High lift tint only works on virgin hair and is super gentle! Ask them to balayage with high lift tint no bleach period. They won't like it they all like to use bleach but too bad it's your hair if the colour is a shade you don't like you can use toning shampoos and treatment after that can add pigment but my biggest regret is ever dealing with bleach my hair continually breaks off at the ends even though I haven't used it for almost 2 years, once I discovered high lift tint I never went back.

It smells DELICIOUS, use it to reduce blow dry time and get beautiful results! Styling for longevity? Use the platinum heat block spray for high gold before using hot tools! Wanna protect those strands? Igk good behavior smells like cookies and supports smooth flat iron styles. Antisocial is my personal favorite igk product, it's an aerosol overnight hair mask that you don't need to rinse out, it's like your silk bonnet in a bottle. Verb ghost, we know I love some verb, ghost oil and ghost dry oil can nourish those ends for any hair type. K18 detox shampoo is your clarifying bestie, and it's color safe! Follow up with the lightweight oil and let it sit for 4 minutes to get some repair and protection at home. And last but not least, for soft and manageable volume I am a fan of the olaplex volume blow dry mist. Pair with no. 6 leave in bond smoother to strengthen and fight frizz!

mov_F25A274A34C8973C75C9E46D06E48C91,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Durante años se nos enseñó que limpiar la piel era un trámite: algo que se hacía rápido, con lo que fuera, solo para pasar al “skincare real”. Pero basta de subestimar el primer paso. Porque si lo que usas para limpiar tu rostro lo irrita, lo reseca o lo intoxica, el resto de tu rutina ya está trabajando en desventaja. Y ahí es donde esta leche limpiadora 99% natural, por solo 16 euros en Amazon durante el Prime Day, entra como un acto de reconciliación con tu piel y con tu lógica. El concepto de “leche limpiadora” puede sonar a ritual vintage, de esos que usaban nuestras madres o abuelas, pero eso no la hace menos vigente. Al contrario: el formato ha evolucionado, pero la lógica sigue siendo impecable. Una buena leche limpiadora —como esta— limpia, desmaquilla, nutre y respeta la barrera cutánea. Todo al mismo tiempo. ¿Y qué hace distinta a esta en particular? Primero, su origen natural: 99% de sus ingredientes vienen de la naturaleza. No hay siliconas disfrazadas, ni perfumes agresivos, ni alcohol que reseca. Solo lo necesario: aceites vegetales, extractos botánicos, emolientes suaves. Y eso, en pieles sensibles, no es un capricho: es supervivencia. El blush rosad de 3 euros que deja efecto Rare Beauty perfecto y sin gastar de más     El fijador de maquillaje viral de Amazon que revive delineadores y ahorra maquillaje     Rizos sin frizz, sin rigidez y con brillo: sí, existe, se llama Olaplex en Amazon Además, su textura es cremosa pero no pesada, lo que permite masajearla con calma, incluso sobre maquillaje cargado. ¿Rímel waterproof? ¿Base full cover? Esta leche los derrite sin restregar, y sin dejar la piel como cartón mojado. El efecto post-limpieza es clave: no tira, no pica, no enrojece. Al contrario, se siente como un primer gesto de autocuidado real, no como un trámite apurado antes de aplicar el siguiente suero. En términos culturales, esta leche representa algo que va más allá de la fórmula. Representa el retorno al skincare sensato, a esa limpieza que no busca dejar la piel “chillando de limpia”, sino cómoda, balanceada, real. En un mercado saturado de activos potentes, exfoliantes químicos y promesas antiage extremas, volver a lo básico es casi radical. Esta leche limpiadora no grita ""tendencia"", pero sí susurra “piel feliz” al oído. Y en una época donde el skincare puede volverse performance, a veces lo más transformador es elegir la opción que no duele, no reseca y no abruma. A 16 euros por Prime Day, no es una ganga. Es un regreso al sentido común, bien formulado. @mundistyle","SPR_COMBO[es]Durante años se nos enseñó que limpiar la piel era un trámite: algo que se hacía rápido, con lo que fuera, solo para pasar al “skincare real”.

El concepto de “leche limpiadora” puede sonar a ritual vintage, de esos que usaban nuestras madres o abuelas, pero eso no la hace menos vigente. Al contrario: el formato ha evolucionado, pero la lógica sigue siendo impecable. Una buena leche limpiadora —como esta— limpia, desmaquilla, nutre y respeta la barrera cutánea. Todo al mismo tiempo. ¿Y qué hace distinta a esta en particular? Primero, su origen natural: 99% de sus ingredientes vienen de la naturaleza. No hay siliconas disfrazadas, ni perfumes agresivos, ni alcohol que reseca. Solo lo necesario: aceites vegetales, extractos botánicos, emolientes suaves. Y eso, en pieles sensibles, no es un capricho: es supervivencia. El blush rosad de 3 euros que deja efecto Rare Beauty perfecto y sin gastar de más El fijador de maquillaje viral de Amazon que revive delineadores y ahorra maquillaje Rizos sin frizz, sin rigidez y con brillo: sí, existe, se llama Olaplex en Amazon Además, su textura es cremosa pero no pesada, lo que permite masajearla con calma, incluso sobre maquillaje cargado. ¿Rímel waterproof? ¿Base full cover? Esta leche los derrite sin restregar, y sin dejar la piel como cartón mojado. El efecto post-limpieza es clave: no tira, no pica, no enrojece. Al contrario, se siente como un primer gesto de autocuidado real, no como un trámite apurado antes de aplicar el siguiente suero. En términos culturales, esta leche representa algo que va más allá de la fórmula. Representa el retorno al skincare sensato, a esa limpieza que no busca dejar la piel “chillando de limpia”, sino cómoda, balanceada, real. En un mercado saturado de activos potentes, exfoliantes químicos y promesas antiage extremas, volver a lo básico es casi radical. Esta leche limpiadora no grita ""tendencia"", pero sí susurra “piel feliz” al oído. Y en una época donde el skincare puede volverse performance, a veces lo más transformador es elegir la opción que no duele, no reseca y no abruma. A 16 euros por Prime Day, no es una ganga. Es un regreso al sentido común, bien formulado.",2025-07-12 06:51:00,es,WEB,,mundistyle,,e41845e1eab4676407d40d892b7d5ea5,,False,1,True,Affiliate,Medium,False,"While the comment is primarily about a cleansing milk, it contains multiple promotional elements:
