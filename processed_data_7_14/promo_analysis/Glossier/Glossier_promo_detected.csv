And not one that must be ignored if you want to make use of the content your users and audience have created for you. But that is not all. User generated content isn't just more trustworthy, it is a lot helpful for boosting SEO factors as well.

They also feature the user generated content on the company's page and social media. * **Lululemon #thesweatlife** - The athletic apparel brand encourages customers to take pictures of themselves doing various activities while clad in Lululemon clothing and post them on social media. * **‚ÄúCrash the Super Bowl‚Äù by Doritos -** Super Bowl aired commercials made by fans, enabling them to win and have them aired.
