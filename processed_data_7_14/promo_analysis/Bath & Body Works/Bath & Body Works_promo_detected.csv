With new drops and returning favorites all in store for this year, the Summerween collection is set to release earlier than ever before. “We're fully embracing this exciting summer trend, which is now bigger than ever, with an incredible collection of fragrances and accessories which capture the true essence of the spooky season,” says Betsy Schumacher, Chief Merchant at Bath & Body Works. “Halloween is one of our customers' favorite times of year and we're meeting them right where they are with the highest quality, trend-forward products to fit every mood and aesthetic.” See the exciting products that you can get your hands on in just a few days.

mov_407609FD1947183152B78CCC79AAE41E,"  Prime Day kicked off today, so there are discounts to be had on Amazon.com on all kinds of items. One way to lock in savings for the future is to take advantage of the numerous third party gift cards that Amazon has put on sale, with many brands available for 10%-20% off or more. That includes DoorDash, Instacart, Lowe's, Lyft, Sephora (indirectly) and more. The Deal   Save on select third party gift cards from Amazon. Direct link to offer (our affiliate link)   Key Terms   Various limits/denominations. Quick Thoughts   There are some great deals available today, but you'll have to check the details for each eligible brand's gift card as they're all different. For example, you can save $10 on $50 worth of Bath & Body Works gift cards, get $20 off $100 of Lyft gift cards, $15 off $100 of Lowe's gift cards, etc. Those are all straight discounts, but there are some deals offering Amazon promo credit that'll expire in the coming months, so you'll want to have a plan to redeem those credits. Also note that some of the deals are for eGift cards, while others are for physical gift cards that'll be shipped to you. There are a few One4All/Choice gift cards listed in there too which can be exchanged for many different brands. The One4All eGift Card is giving $10 off on $100 of spend and can be redeemed for a wide range of brands including Home Depot. The One4All/Choice Fun & Fabulous brand can be exchanged for gift cards for brands including Sephora, Nordstrom, Victoria's Secret and more. Be aware that you don't have to buy the specific denominations to get the discount. For example, if a deal gives $20 off a $100 gift card purchase, you don't necessarily have to buy a $100 gift card. You could instead buy two $50 gift cards, four $25 gift cards, etc. If you're buying for personal use then it might not be worth buying several smaller denominations, but if you want to buy some as gifts (e.g. by stocking up on stocking stuffers for December), buying several smaller denominations could come in handy. It looks like these aren't one-time only deals. Although you're limited to one discount per brand per order, it appears that you can get the discount again in a subsequent order. Just be sure to verify the discount is being correctly applied when checking out; it worked when quickly checking a brand I'd already bought just now, but some brands might have some kind of limit hardcoded. To take advantage of these deals you'll need a Prime subscription – adding them to your cart as a non-Prime member will result in no discount being applied. The good thing is that it's usually possible to get a 30 day free trial to Prime which means you can enroll for free now, then cancel before the 30 day trial is up if all you want to do is get Prime Day deals. Click here (our affiliate link) to see if you're targeted for the free trial. You can save even more on these gift card deals if you're targeted for one of the bank offers giving a discount on Amazon when using one or more of their points. For example, this Membership Rewards offer gives up to 40% off on up to $100 of spend. These types of deal are only valid on items shipped and sold by Amazon which these gift cards are. I bought $500 worth of gift cards earlier for $379.99 based on 15% and 20% discounts, as well as $40 off from that Membership Rewards deal, along with a $0.01 discount for redeeming one Membership Reward point. That's a total discount of 24% overall which is a superb deal. The post Amazon Prime Day gift card deals: Save on DoorDash, Lyft, Lowe's, Instacart & many more appeared first on Frequent Miler .
