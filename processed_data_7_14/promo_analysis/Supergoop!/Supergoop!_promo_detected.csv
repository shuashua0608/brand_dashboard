Nordstrom understands the beauty of a great deal. During the department store's much-awaited Anniversary Sale, hundreds of beauty sets are up for grabs — including exclusives from hardly-ever-on-sale luxury brands like La Mer, Augustinus Bader and Dr. Dennis Gross. Page Six's Picks While deals are already available for Nordstrom Icon cardholders, they open to the brand's Ambassador tier on July 9, followed by Influencers and the general public on July 10 and 12, respectively. Below, start shopping (or curating your wishlist) with our roundup of the best celebrity-approved beauty buys — but act fast, as the most popular products tend to sell out long before the sale ends on August 4. Nordstrom La Mer's products are famously pricey, but stars like Jennifer Lopez, Kate Hudson and Selena Gomez swear they're worth it. Right now, Nordstrom's offering a rare opportunity to bag the luxury line's signature Créme de La Mer for less, along with several other mini must-haves. Nordstrom Want to smell like a star? Sofia Richie and Meghan Markle have both cited this mineral, woody Jo Malone London blend as a signature scent. Nordstrom This bestselling formula does triple duty as makeup remover, cleanser and moisturizer. Equally multitasking stars like Bethenny Frankel rave about the stuff, now available in a jumbo value version exclusively at Nordstrom. “I am partial to the original one because it makes me feel like I'm in a botanical spa,” Frankel said on TikTok, naming it one of the “expensive” items she deems “worth it.” Nordstrom Emily Ratajkowski called these pre-packaged peels “the best for exfoliating your skin” in a recent W interview, admitting she'd skipped the skincare step before. “I've noticed a huge improvement in the texture and tonal quality of my skin,” she raved. Nordstrom If splurging doesn't scare you, there's also an unheard-of deal on a set featuring the brand's SpectraLite FaceWare Pro mask. (It's like getting peel pads, blurring cream and a lip treatment for free.) “I would die for it,” DeSorbo raved of the red- and blue light-powered mask in an Amazon Live. “I truly think it is one of the only LED masks I've ever used that actually works.” Pro tip: Sets like this have been among the first to sell out in previous years, so we'd recommend snapping this one up fast. Nordstrom From famous faces to Page Six staffers, plenty of beauty experts swear by NuFace. Tay Lautner told us the “super user-friendly” device is one of her “favorite things to use to help lift, plump and smooth [her] skin before an event,” while Kate Hudson raved about the brand to Mindbodygreen. “When I do the NuFace every day, I feel a huge difference in my skin,” she told the outlet. I was not expecting that because I always think those things feel gimmicky, but they really work.” Our very own managing editor, Alexandra D'Aluisio, is also a fan: “Nicola Coughlan used the NuFace Trinity+ in a Vogue “Beauty Secrets” video … she even insisted she knew when she 'went ham' on the product because her 'cheekbones were cheekboning' in certain scenes,” she says. “That was enough to convince me to buy, and I've been trying to use it at least three times a week ever since.” Nordstrom Sabrina Carpenter can do a lot with 15 minutes — but applying her signature blush will only take you a matter of seconds. The star's long worked with makeup artist Carolina Gonzalez, who told us she applies the blendable formula on the mid-apples of the pop phenom's cheeks. “When you start on the cheekbone and go up from there, it gives you more of a lifted and snatched look,” Gonzalez explained. Nordstrom Love the Longchamp Le Pliage totes stars and royals like Kate Middleton have carried? In addition to a full-size version, the sale also includes this adorable mini makeup bag. Nordstrom Plenty of superstars stock up on Supergoop! , from Brooke Shields and Jessica Chastain to Christie Brinkley. (The latter recently told us she swears by the brand's “easy formulas.”) Nordstrom The 411 on stars' favorite face masks? So many stars use 111Skin, it just might be easier to name A-listers who haven't raved about the brand. Sydney Sweeney, Lady Gaga, Bella Hadid, Jenna Lyons and Priyanka Chopra (to name but a few) have all been linked to the label's luxe skincare. Page Six Style & Shopping Editor Elana Fishman is also impressed with the products, saying of the rose gold mask included in this set, “I slapped on this mask the morning of a video shoot, hoping it'd help me look my best on camera — and boy, did it live up to the hype.” Nordstrom...","Page Six may be compensated and/or receive an affiliate commission if you click or buy through our links.

Unseen Sunscreen Spf 50 (Was $38) While technically this is a facial sunscreen, it doubles as a makeup primer that can be used anytime, anywhere. Katherine J.

STANLEY Quencher H2.0 Tumbler with Handle and Straw 40 oz — $27 (was $45) Stanley made big mugs THE thing to carry. This 40-ounce mother of mugs carries as much fluid as a 7-Eleven Super Big Gulp while stylishly keeping hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold, and it still fits in most car cup holders. Be warned: Stanley deals are going out of stock fast, and only some colors—think Almond Rose and Fuschia—are available for under $30 right now. Move fast. More deals on insulated drinkware and containers LEGO Classic Large Creative Brick Box 10698 Building Toy Set — $25.59 (was $59.99) People love a creative Lego set that becomes, say, the Millennium Falcon, Old Trafford, or a cute flower bouquet. The problem is that those masterpieces usually stay masterpieces forever. If you need a set of bricks to actually play with or fuel original designs, this box of classic blocks is it. The play set includes two green base plates, six toy tires with rims, and more than 700 other bricks in 33 colors.

If your current bottle is running low—or if you're still rationing those pea-sized dollops—consider this your nudge to restock. Dermatologists recommend using a full ounce on any exposed skin and reapplying every two hours, after swimming, or if you're super sweaty. Yeah, you probably need another tube. Unseen Sunscreen feels almost like a dry powder on the skin. It's never tacky, greasy, or shiny. It's basically magic in a tube, and your future sun-damage-free self will thank you.

I would say Korean skincare products work like magic, but that belittles the shocking amount of science behind them. LANEIGE specializes in hydrating skin, infusing products like this blurring powder with hyaluronic acid, ceramides, peptides, antioxidants, amino acids, and plant extracts.

There are more deals than you could ever begin to look through on your own...so that's where we come in. We waded through the mountains of bargains for you and found some of the best deals in every category. FYI — deals move *fast*. We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. Hypoallergenic Blueland laundry detergent tablets for 30% off — this powerful plastic-free tablet can be dropped directly into the drum of your washing machine for stain-lifting magic. Oh, and once you realize how much easier (and better for our planet) this is than liquid detergent/pods, you'll never want to go back, so prepare wisely now. Promising review: ""I absolutely love these laundry tablets. I have always felt guilty about throwing such a large plastic jug away, and now I don't have to! I love how compact these tablets are; it makes them perfect even for traveling, and they leave my clothes smelling great. They work well with both hot and cold water, so I have no complaints!"" —Eme N. Price: $20.99 (originally $29.99) 2. Supergoop best-sellers for 20% off, including the wildly popular Glowscreen SPF 40 for anyone who wants a super glowy, lit-from-within complexion at all times. Better yet, it doubles as a makeup-gripping primer, so your glow will shine through your foundation while keeping you protected. Promising review: ""I've tried a lot of sunscreen and primers over the last year. I mean A LOT. My skin is super sensitive, acne-prone, and prone to dryness and redness. (Complicated, I know) This stuff doesn't feel heavy and moisturizes really well while not feeling like I'll break out later. It protected my skin from sunburn during six hours at Six Flags. I don't wear a ton of makeup, but the foundation and bronzer I wore didn't budge or crease. It makes your skin glow like [wild], which alone is a bit much for me, but under some foundation, it looks amazing! Def worth the buy and will buy again."" —H.E. Price: $17.60+ (originally $22+; available in three sizes and four shades; see more Supergoop deals here) 3. An Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for 50% off — if you've been putting off upgrading your old one or getting another one for your guest room, then now is the time to do it! Use this to stream over a million movies and shows, plus it even has an AI-powered TV search to help you find exactly what you need without struggling to type it in. Promising review: ""The Alexa Fire Stick might be the greatest invention since drive-thru coffee. I plugged it in, blinked twice, and boom — it was up and running. I didn't need a tech degree or a YouTube tutorial narrated by someone whispering in a British accent. Setup? Ridiculously simple. Navigation? Smooth like jazz. Lag? Nonexistent. This thing moves faster than I do when someone says, “Free snacks in the break room.” I press the mic button and say, “Find mystery shows,” and Alexa serves them up like a psychic with a popcorn addiction. No scrolling, no back-and-forth, no spelling out titles like I'm on Wheel of Fortune. The layout is clean and makes actual sense. Everything I want is right there. It's like it knows I'm too tired to think after 8 p.m. and hands me exactly what I didn't know I needed. Bonus: It's tiny.

News I don't mean to alarm you, but there are fewer than 24 hours before Amazon Prime Day 2025 officially ends on July 11. Have you refreshed your minimalist wardrobe with the best fashion basics deals yet? Or have you picked up your favorite discounted summer beauty products? If not, don't fret—navigating the thousands of Prime Day clothing, shoes, and beauty deals can be overwhelming. That's why I'm sharing my curated selection of the best last-chance deals worth adding to your cart before Prime Day is over. Ahead, I've rounded up the can't-miss deals of Amazon Prime Day across every major category. There are summer travel essentials like linen pants, matching sets, and my favorite-ever headphones for airplanes. I also included it-girl-approved summery shoes to hold you over for the rest of the season. On the beauty front, expect to find deals on nail polishes and beauty devices, as well as my holy-grail sunscreen and laser hair removal device. Without further ado, see below for all of the Amazon Prime Day deals you don't want to miss. If you haven't filled up your cart just yet, I can practically guarantee you'll want to after seeing these picks.

These headphones were a personal Amazon Prime Day purchase that may be the best deal I've spotted of the entire sale event. Not only is the sound quality incredible, but I'm obsessed with being able to easily switch between the two listening modes, Noise Canceling and Transparency. These are the exact white tank tops Kendall Jenner loves. With how many ways you can style this button-down shirt, it's well worth adding to your cart. This summer dress would be so easy to throw on with sandals. These cute wedges fit summer's boho fashion trend to a T. You can never have too many staple tank tops. Wear this loungewear set to the airport to stay comfortable and stylish. How cool are these fisherman sandals? If this bag is good enough for Bella Hadid, it's good enough for me. Last Chance Amazon Prime Day Beauty Deals If your skills in hair styling are lacking, you need the Shark Flexstyle in your life. It makes doing a variety of styles, from voluminous curls to sleek blowouts, as easy as can be. One of the best upgrades you can make to your beauty routine is by investing in this laser hair device.

52e9bf580b11bae5432a889fa87f04e3,"  SPR_COMBO[fr]Soins beauté Coup de soleil sur les lèvres: nos conseils pour le prévenir et le traiter Photographe : Photo de Morgan Alley sur Unsplash Pour bien se protéger du soleil, les lèvres ne doivent pas être oubliées. Avant de s'exposer au soleil, on veille à protéger notre corps et notre visage. On choisit alors la bonne crème solaire, on l'applique méticuleusement sur les épaules, le dos, les bras, le visage, le cou... Pourtant, une zone manque souvent à l'appel. Si on met de la crème SPF sur le visage, on ne pense pas toujours aux lèvres. Les lèvres aussi ont besoin d'être protégées du soleil et de rester hydratées. La peau y est particulièrement fine et délicate, donc susceptible de prendre un coup de soleil. Comment reconnaître un coup de soleil sur les lèvres? Si vos lèvres ont trop pris le soleil et n'ont pas été protégées, en cas de coup de soleil léger, elles seront sèches et irritées. Si celui-ci est intense, des cloques blanches peuvent survenir, ainsi que des saignements. La lèvre inférieure sera très certainement la plus touchée, puisque c'est celle qui capte le plus la lumière. Comment traiter le coup de soleil sur les lèvres? Si le coup de soleil est léger, hydratez vos lèvres régulièrement. Vous pouvez utiliser de l'aloe vera que vous aurez au préalable laissé refroidir au réfrigérateur.

Avant de s'exposer au soleil, on veille à protéger notre corps et notre visage. On choisit alors la bonne crème solaire, on l'applique méticuleusement sur les épaules, le dos, les bras, le visage, le cou... Pourtant, une zone manque souvent à l'appel. Si on met de la crème SPF sur le visage, on ne pense pas toujours aux lèvres. Les lèvres aussi ont besoin d'être protégées du soleil et de rester hydratées. La peau y est particulièrement fine et délicate, donc susceptible de prendre un coup de soleil. Comment reconnaître un coup de soleil sur les lèvres? Si vos lèvres ont trop pris le soleil et n'ont pas été protégées, en cas de coup de soleil léger, elles seront sèches et irritées. Si celui-ci est intense, des cloques blanches peuvent survenir, ainsi que des saignements. La lèvre inférieure sera très certainement la plus touchée, puisque c'est celle qui capte le plus la lumière. Comment traiter le coup de soleil sur les lèvres? Si le coup de soleil est léger, hydratez vos lèvres régulièrement. Vous pouvez utiliser de l'aloe vera que vous aurez au préalable laissé refroidir au réfrigérateur. L'irritation peut aussi être soulagée par un gant de toilette humide qui va rafraîchir la zone. N'arrachez pas la peau sèche, elle se détachera toute seule lorsque la nouvelle sera prête. Si le coup de soleil est intense, n'essayez pas de faire éclater les cloques. Laissez-les disparaître d'elles-mêmes. Elles peuvent rester de 5 à 15 jours, alors faites preuve de patience.
