1lor7e8,"  Hi guys! I've recently started wearing perfume more often and I'm looking for some recs that are lower cost and where to find the good ones for cheap. I have: My way nectar by Armani - by far my fave and I've used half the bottle already. Idole - Clinique - I love but it's a little strong for work, I like the faded scent more than I love it when I first spray Mayar - lattafa I blind bought on Amazon for 25 bucks and I love how fruity it is. I bought the floral fruity one. I really would love recs to continue on my scent journey. I never really invested in perfume and only had ever tried like bath and body works spray that didn't last and gave me headaches. I'm really enjoying actual perfume. I'm around 30 so I'm not looking for any scents that feel super dated. If there's any cheap bangers, please let me know.","Hi guys!

7b7f3679dd7b680e20ddf4d1528ee52d,"  US Open: inizio misto per le contrattazioni del secondo semestre Martedì, le contrattazioni di Wall Street hanno registrato un inizio misto per le azioni, con gli investitori sintonizzati sul discorso del presidente della Federal Reserve, Jerome Powell. As of 1515 BST, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.43% at 44,284.97, while the S&P 500 lost 0.05% to 6,201.96 and the Nasdaq Composite came out of the gate 0.16% softer at 20,336.50. Martedì il Dow ha aperto in rialzo di 190.20 punti, basandosi sui guadagni registrati nella sessione precedente. Tuesday's primary focus was set to be comments from Powell, with the Fed head revealing that the central bank would have already eased monetary policy by now if not for Donald Trump's tariff so-called ""Liberation Day"" tariffs. ""In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,"" said Powell, just a day after Donald Trump sent him a handwritten note demanding ultra-low interest rates. ""Jerome, come al solito sei arrivato 'troppo tardi'. Sei costato una fortuna agli Stati Uniti, e continui a farlo. Dovresti abbassare il tasso, di molto!"" , ha detto Trump. ""Centinaia di miliardi di dollari persi! Nessuna inflazione."" Sul fronte macro, S&P Global's manufacturing PMI rose to 52.9 in June, up from 52 in May and ahead of both a flash estimate of 52 and expectations of 51. Output rose for the first time in four months and at the second fastest pace since March 2024 amid higher demand for capacity. On the price front, input costs accelerated the most in nearly three years, driving output charges to jump their highest level since September 2022. Altrove, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI ticked up to 49 in June, up from 48.5 in May and ahead of expectations of 48.8. While economic activity in the manufacturing sector contracted for the fourth consecutive month, the rate of contraction slowed amid a rebound in production and improvements in inventories. On another note, the US economy created 374,000 jobs in May, according to il Bureau of Labor Statistics, as job openings rose to 7.76m, with the largest gains seen in accommodation and food services. In contrast, job openings in the US federal government fell by 39,000. Finally, US construction spending decreased by 0.30% month-on-month in May, according to l'ufficio del censimento, dropping to a seasonally adjusted annualised rate of $2.13trn from April's revised 0.4% decrease. In the corporate space, shares Facebook parent company Meta Piattaforme traded higher after the tech giant revealed plans for an AI lab focused on ""superintelligence"" that will include researchers poached from OpenAI, while electric carmaker Tesla traded lower after Donald Trump suggested that il Dipartimento dell'Efficienza del Governo should look into the subsidies received by companies under the leadership of Elon Musk.

In a video posted Tuesday and receiving over 7 million views, Samantha, a content creator, walks around her house showing off a life of luxury with “rich people” items such as matching bedside tables, Bath and Body Works handsoap, and a large area rug in the living room. “If you got a fridge in the garage, you're rich,” Samantha said, proudly displaying her own unit. “Double points if you got a deep freezer – I ain't there yet.” In another scene, she proudly showed off the headboard on her bed. “Headboards in all the rooms, OK? My children, me, my other children, we all got a headboard.” Samantha continued, “There ain't nothing wrong with a mattress on the floor. Been there, done that. Not anymore. We're rich.” She even offered one “controversial” take. “A TV hanging on the wall, OK? That just screams rich people s**t. But I do still have some TVs on some entertainment centers, though,” Samantha admitted.

These are all rich people things! Congratulations – you've made it!” “Gotta keep a few TVs on stands so your guests don't feel too uncomfortable being in a mansion,” another person joked.

The Final Four: • Fairlane Town Center (Dearborn) • Southland Center (Taylor) • Laurel Park Place (Livonia) • Westland Mall (Westland) Each mall is scored on foot traffic, food court availability, and how many people are still pretending it's 2007. Southland is a top seed, powered by Cinemark, Ulta, H&M, and a Best Buy. “You can still get a pretzel and your eyebrows done in one trip,” said Mike Hunt, local shopper. “That's more than I can say for my marriage.” Fairlane, once counted out, is surging after renovations. With Macy's, H&M, Sephora, Zara, and a lively food court, it's the surprise comeback of the bracket. “It's the only place I've seen a working escalator and a Cinnabon in the same day,” said Buster Highman, local shopper and voter. Laurel Park wins points for being clean, calm, and oddly soothing. Anchored by Von Maur and Dunham's, it's basically a quiet place for mall walkers. “It's like a mall on Ambien,” said a former mall employee, Dia Rhea. Westland Mall is the wildcard. Most stores are gone, but a stubborn handful like Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret still hang on. “You go for the nostalgia,” said Westland resident Drew Peacock, “and because the ghost of Payless whispers deals to you in the hallway.” Meanwhile, Somerset and 12 Oaks are watching the bracket like rich cousins at a family reunion. “We don't really get involved with that side of the family,” said Somerset shopper, Dick Hertz. “But good luck to… whichever one has the pretzels.” The winner will receive a championship banner made from Auntie Anne's napkins and a Bath & Body Works candle labeled “Last One Lit.” Voting ends next week…assuming none of them shut down first.","With Eastland, Northland, and Wonderland gone, Wayne County residents have launched a March Madness-style bracket to decide which mall will be the last to survive.

n1m18di,"  I used to work in retail- most stores have really good return policies. Companies want to please the customer. They want you to come back and keep spending your money. Most places will usually take anything back- usually for full price or for a reduced price depending on different factors. The process is also usually pretty easy and hassle free. If you're ever having issues at a particular location/with an associate, they're just being difficult for no reason. Go to another location, on a different day, or try CS online. If you're ever worried about a return, look up the return policy online. An example store would be Ulta: I usually try to keep my box and receipt, because I'm anxious and want to make the process as smooth as possible. They honestly don't really need anything. When you go in they will ask if you have a receipt. If you don't, they can look up the purchase on your account with phone number. They may ask you how much was used or a reason for returning- sometimes they don't. They'll scan it and return the money. The process literally takes less than 5 minutes. Another example is Amazon: You can start the return in the app and return it to your local Kohls. You do 90% of it online. Take the QR code to the return desk and they will scan it and take it. No questions asked. When I worked at Bath and Body Works our return policy was 100% guarantee. This was back 2019-2021, so the policy has definitely changed. At the time you could literally return anything. It could be fully used or 1 year old- we had to take it. I saw your comment about it being an inconvenience, but it's not any weight on the employee. It's just another “transaction”. They would come in with their item. I would ask the reasoning because the system wants to know- I genuinely didn't care. I was just asking so I could press a button. If it was an item we still had in stock, the customer would get a full refund. If it was an old item that was no longer sold, I would grab a correlating item in one of the core collections and use that bar code. You would get back what the price of that was, even if it wasn't what you paid. If they wanted to exchange items, it would be a 1 for 1 thing. If you spent $49.95, you would go get your items totaling to $49.95. After the transaction was done, I would just toss the items on a shelf in the back. No hassle to me.","I used to work in retail- most stores have really good return policies. Companies want to please the customer. They want you to come back and keep spending your money.

mov_AEFB248551A03D17FC51A9B3597B02CE,"  A sense of déjà vu permeates the latest report on brand trust. Morning Consult's 2025 Most Reputable Brands analysis reveals that the companies consumers rely on most today bear a striking resemblance to those favored during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. This resurgence of trust in established brands underscores a continued prioritization of safety, security, and essential needs, even as the world navigates a new normal. The report, which surveyed consumers across all demographics, highlights a consistent preference for brands associated with cleanliness, health, and reliable service. But what does this sustained loyalty tell us about the evolving consumer mindset and the enduring power of established brands in a rapidly changing world? Across all consumer touchpoints, a handful of categories consistently emerged as leaders in brand trust. These include: Home Keeping and Hygiene: Brands like Dawn, Clorox, Lysol, Mr. Clean, and Home Depot continue to be cornerstones of consumer confidence. Self- and Personal Care: Dove, Oral-B, Kleenex, and Colgate remain trusted staples in daily routines. Health: BAND-AID and Tylenol exemplify the enduring trust in brands providing essential healthcare solutions. Packages and Shipping/Ecommerce: UPS, Amazon, the United States Postal Service, and FedEx are vital for modern commerce and maintain high levels of consumer trust. And, let's not forget the comfort factor: Hershey's and M&M's demonstrate that even indulgence can be a source of reliable satisfaction. Maslow's Hierarchy and the Modern Consumer These favored brands directly address fundamental human needs, as outlined in Maslow's Hierarchy. From physiological needs (food, hygiene) to safety and security, consumers are gravitating towards brands that provide a sense of stability and well-being. This isn't simply nostalgia; it's a reflection of ongoing anxieties and a desire for predictability in an uncertain world. Deeper Dive: Trust Across Specific Verticals Morning Consult's analysis extended beyond broad categories, examining trust within specific consumer verticals.

Younger consumers, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, demonstrate a growing trust in social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube, while older generations tend to favor legacy brands with established reputations. This generational gap highlights the evolving role of media and marketing in shaping consumer perceptions. Adweek's analysis provides further insight into these differing perspectives. Pro Tip: Building brand trust requires consistent delivery on promises, transparent communication, and a genuine commitment to customer well-being. The Rise of Health and Sustainability Concerns Recent data from the dunnhumby Consumer Trends Tracker reinforces the growing importance of health and sustainability for U.S. consumers. Two-thirds of consumers prioritize sourcing products that align with their dietary needs, and nearly half believe retailers should actively support healthy choices. This trend extends to a preference for local businesses and products, driven by a desire for transparency and connection. As the 2025 Edelman Trust Barometer demonstrates, trust is increasingly built through local relationships rather than distant national brands. However, economic realities are also impacting consumer behavior. With potential cuts to SNAP benefits and rising food costs, one in four U.S. households, and over a third of those aged 18-34, have been forced to skip meals in the past year. This underscores the critical role of food security and the need for accessible, affordable nutrition. The growing movement towards “food as medicine” is gaining traction, recognizing that food is not merely sustenance but a fundamental component of health and well-being....","A sense of déjà vu permeates the latest report on brand trust.

Amazon Prime Day is here, offering top-tier discounts across a ton of popular categories like beauty and wellness, tech and vacuums during the four-day event, which is exclusive to Prime members. Some of the best discounts extend to gift cards, which are often available as Lightning Deals that only run for a few hours and change throughout the day.

One way to lock in savings for the future is to take advantage of the numerous third party gift cards that Amazon has put on sale, with many brands available for 10%-20% off or more. That includes DoorDash, Instacart, Lowe's, Lyft, Sephora (indirectly) and more. The Deal   Save on select third party gift cards from Amazon. Direct link to offer (our affiliate link)   Key Terms   Various limits/denominations. Quick Thoughts   There are some great deals available today, but you'll have to check the details for each eligible brand's gift card as they're all different. For example, you can save $10 on $50 worth of Bath & Body Works gift cards, get $20 off $100 of Lyft gift cards, $15 off $100 of Lowe's gift cards, etc. Those are all straight discounts, but there are some deals offering Amazon promo credit that'll expire in the coming months, so you'll want to have a plan to redeem those credits. Also note that some of the deals are for eGift cards, while others are for physical gift cards that'll be shipped to you. There are a few One4All/Choice gift cards listed in there too which can be exchanged for many different brands. The One4All eGift Card is giving $10 off on $100 of spend and can be redeemed for a wide range of brands including Home Depot. The One4All/Choice Fun & Fabulous brand can be exchanged for gift cards for brands including Sephora, Nordstrom, Victoria's Secret and more. Be aware that you don't have to buy the specific denominations to get the discount. For example, if a deal gives $20 off a $100 gift card purchase, you don't necessarily have to buy a $100 gift card. You could instead buy two $50 gift cards, four $25 gift cards, etc. If you're buying for personal use then it might not be worth buying several smaller denominations, but if you want to buy some as gifts (e.g. by stocking up on stocking stuffers for December), buying several smaller denominations could come in handy. It looks like these aren't one-time only deals. Although you're limited to one discount per brand per order, it appears that you can get the discount again in a subsequent order. Just be sure to verify the discount is being correctly applied when checking out; it worked when quickly checking a brand I'd already bought just now, but some brands might have some kind of limit hardcoded. To take advantage of these deals you'll need a Prime subscription – adding them to your cart as a non-Prime member will result in no discount being applied. The good thing is that it's usually possible to get a 30 day free trial to Prime which means you can enroll for free now, then cancel before the 30 day trial is up if all you want to do is get Prime Day deals. Click here (our affiliate link) to see if you're targeted for the free trial. You can save even more on these gift card deals if you're targeted for one of the bank offers giving a discount on Amazon when using one or more of their points. For example, this Membership Rewards offer gives up to 40% off on up to $100 of spend. These types of deal are only valid on items shipped and sold by Amazon which these gift cards are. I bought $500 worth of gift cards earlier for $379.99 based on 15% and 20% discounts, as well as $40 off from that Membership Rewards deal, along with a $0.01 discount for redeeming one Membership Reward point.

I've always tried to make my place look presentable and nice for company (I don't even get that much company). But recently I feel like everything is kind of bland (I like that you used that, very fitting) and boring. I love books and Bath and Body works wallflower of all things gave me the idea to decorate and make my living room feel like a bookstore/cafe. From Tik Tok I found that I like a cottage vibe, so that's what I am going to do in the kitchen. I have a different theme or design idea for every room, and none of it goes together. And I don't care. I'm going to do what makes me happy. I've searched Pinterest, Amazon, and googled for ideas and items.

But recently I feel like everything is kind of bland (I like that you used that, very fitting) and boring. I love books and Bath and Body works wallflower of all things gave me the idea to decorate and make my living room feel like a bookstore/cafe. From Tik Tok I found that I like a cottage vibe, so that's what I am going to do in the kitchen. I have a different theme or design idea for every room, and none of it goes together. And I don't care. I'm going to do what makes me happy. I've searched Pinterest, Amazon, and googled for ideas and items.

2fc0825bbc71d0329f00efaddc0da417,"  Glendale couple, delivery driver arrested in connection with organized retail theft ring Jul 11, 2025, 12:32 PM PHOENIX — Three people, including a married couple, were arrested for their alleged involvement in a Valley-based organized retail theft ring, authorities announced Thursday. The operation allegedly trafficked over $350,000 in stolen merchandise, according to the Phoenix Police Department. In addition, the group is suspected of similar crimes in Texas and Nevada, police said. A Glendale husband and wife — Nephtali Santiago-Garcia and Yuli “Nissy” Degante-Vigueras – are accused of being the primary sellers for the organized retail theft ring. How did Glendale couple allegedly run organized retail theft ring? They allegedly turned their living room into a storefront for $160,000 in products mostly stolen from Bath & Body Works locations. Police said they fenced stolen merchandise at least 17 times from April 2023 to April 2024. The couple was arrested on April 9, 2025, and booked on counts of theft, fraudulent schemes, illegal control of an enterprise and trafficking in stolen property. The ongoing investigation led to Marcos Ortega Hernandez, a driver for a trucking company that delivered products to retailers such as Bath & Body Works, Old Navy, Victoria's Secret, Gap and Banana Republic. He allegedly was paid over $72,000 to divert about $200,000 worth of merchandise to the Glendale couple so they could sell it. Hernandez was arrested June 26 after police served a search warrant at his home and found stolen items. He was booked for fraudulent schemes and trafficking in stolen property. Organized retail theft is a growing problem in metro Phoenix. The number of cases the Maricopa County Attorney's Office received almost doubled in 2024 compared to the year before.

The ongoing investigation led to Marcos Ortega Hernandez, a driver for a trucking company that delivered products to retailers such as Bath & Body Works, Old Navy, Victoria's Secret, Gap and Banana Republic. He allegedly was paid over $72,000 to divert about $200,000 worth of merchandise to the Glendale couple so they could sell it. Hernandez was arrested June 26 after police served a search warrant at his home and found stolen items. He was booked for fraudulent schemes and trafficking in stolen property. Organized retail theft is a growing problem in metro Phoenix. The number of cases the Maricopa County Attorney's Office received almost doubled in 2024 compared to the year before.

Secondly, do things that make you happy or relaxed. For me, I take a bath with the works, epson salt, bath bomb, candles, a glass of wine, etc. I tense up when I'm stressed so it relaxes my muscles and I smell nice afterwards! Thirdly, do the basics. The three most important things to keep your body and mind healthy is eat, sleep, and exercise. Being consistent with these will do loads for you. I like walks with an audio book and I make sure to have easy meals when I have trouble making food and ones that take more prep for when I feel good.

mov_66BD69729AD155FFC2A5FFE6964E3456,"  To Pemberley and Beyond: A Traveller's Guide to England by the Bennets, Darcys, and Their Many Friends by Quincy Christian Alexander, Celestial Publishing Co., & Princeton Studios A couple of months ago Princeton Studios reached out me about their book, To Pemberley and Beyond, being available free on Amazon kindle for five days. They also asked me to read and review it. I promised I would… Just kidding! They didn't have to wait that long! I did plan to post this sooner but I had other promised reviews and then life got in the way. But here it is, finally. When I read the title of the book, I missed the part on the bottom that it was written by the Bennets and Darcy's; along with their family and friends. I expected it to be an actual travel guide, but then opened it up. It contains about 60 short essays about the Regnecy era written by the Bennets, Bingleys, Darcys, Collinses, de Bourgs, Phillips, Gardiner, etc. Almost every family member writes something. It's interesting because this is kind of like a hybrid of genres; it has factual information about the Regency Era, but each one is “told” by a fictional character. I would definitely recommend this for Jane Austen fans who are interested in learning more about the culture and society the Pride and Prejudice characters lived in that isn't written in a textbook way. This is especially perfect for those who struggle reading nonfiction or avoid them. Some of the essays are written a little too well; the ones by Mr. Collins were very entertaining but also very flowery, pompous, and he could have definitely said the same thing in less words. It was a perfect representation! I really enjoyed the essays on ladies clothing, although my kindle edition had some drawing that were intact and then others that had portions missing, I'm not sure if that was a “printer's error” or if that was how the image was supposed to be. For instance some images look like this: But then others like this: But that is my only real complaint (that and I did spot a reference to Robert Lewis Stevenson who wasn't born before 1813). In “From Morning Calls to Royal Galas: The Proper Wardrobe for a Society Lady in London” by Louisa Hurst she mentions that women should wear “a delicate scent, such as rose or bergamot.” I can't wear perfume because I'm sensitive to smells, but when I read this I thought I love Earl Grey Tea, I would love to have bergamot as my personal scent. Then yesterday, I went shopping at Bath and Body Works for hand sanitizer, and discovered they have a whole Lavender and Bergamot line. They also have a Rose and Ivy line, so if you are looking for bergamot or rose they have you covered. I bought the hand sanitizer so now I too can have a “delicate scent.” I also enjoyed the essay “How to Host a Proper Ball” by Mrs. Bennet. This composition details all that goes into planning a ball from food, to lighting, to entertainment. This part also stood out to me: “Nothing flatters a young lady's complexion more than the soft glow of candlelight. What is a ball if not an occasion to shine?” It reminded me of what Fran Fine always says in The Nanny about the best lighting being candles, sunset, and moonlight. Emma (1996) I also really enjoyed “The Rhythm of a Country Day: A Guide to Social Customs” by Jane Bennet Bingley which offers a view into what an average day would be like for someone on the social scale of the Bennets in 1813 England. I love tea, so of course I loved reading “Steeped in Tradition: History and Varieties of English Tea” by Jane Bennet Bingley. This was a great read as it went over the brief history of tea being brought to England, the type of teas that people drank, and the custom of “tea time”. “…tea serves as both an introduction and an invitation. It is a moment to pause amidst the bustle of the day, to savour not only the beverage but the company and the ritual itself. Whether you find yourself enjoying a smoky Bohea, a refreshing Hyson, or a delicate Young Hyson, may your experience of tea offer both comfort and delight…” Reading it made me want to prepare myself a pot of tea. So I did. It was a fun read and a perfect addition to any Jane Austen fan's collection.
