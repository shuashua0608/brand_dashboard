n1hgl22,"  I somewhat disagree. Depending on how bad the acne is, a lot can be achieved in 3.5 weeks. Mighty Patch - get some and use them on pimples. Invest in a skincare routine from The Ordinary. ""IT"" Cosmetics' ""Bye Bye Breakout"" serum is great (salicylic acid, lactic acid, and a postbiotic ferment). From The Ordinary (to get the products as quickly as possible, go to Ulta or Sephora), get a granactive retinoid emulsion (my preference) or a retinol (start with a low %), niacinamide, and a good face wash. If you don't get the Bye Bye Breakout, get salicylic acid from The Ordinary. Get Hyaluronic Acid from The Ordinary. You may need their ""Soothing & Barrier Support Serum,"" too. Wash your face at least every night - every morning, too, if your face is oily. Use the serums and patches after you wash your face - use them in the order I've listed them here. CeraVe & Cetaphil both make great facial moisturizers and body lotions - get some. Use the facial moisturizer at the end of your skincare routine. Use the lotion on your hands EVERY time you wash them. Use the lotion on your body *at least once a day* - be generous with it, take your time to coat every part of your body, and rub/massage it in. Use lotion after every shower/bath. If your skin is really *that* dry,  invest in Kosas Good Body Skin AHA + Enzyme Exfoliating Body Wash AND Glow Recipe's AHA body cream (you can pick whichever scent you'd like). Use the Kosas exfoliating body wash before each shower/bath - apply it to your body, let it sit as directed, then get in the shower/bath and wash it off. After the shower, apply the Glow Recipe AHA body cream. Heritage Store's roll-on castor oil - you can get this and apply this after each shower/before bed BEFORE lotion/body cream to the driest areas of your skin (knuckles, wrists, elbows, etc - wherever is driest). I also really like Everyone's Nourishing Lotion (coconut + lemon) and Ginger Lily Farms' Butter Lotion (available on Amazon in giant gallon bottles, super cheap - be sure to get a pump from Ginger Lily Farms). I have baby soft skin, and these are the products I use. I'm constantly complimented on how soft my skin is. Don't worry, OP! You can do *a lot* about dry skin and acne in 3 weeks. And, if she likes you and isn't a piece of crap, some acne or dry skin isn't going to change that.","I somewhat disagree. Depending on how bad the acne is, a lot can be achieved in 3.5 weeks.
