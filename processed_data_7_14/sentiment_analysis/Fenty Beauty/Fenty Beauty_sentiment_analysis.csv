353ffb64eee683bc3c4823c67a422e48,"  The Black Beauty market is exhibiting robust expansion driven by increasing consumer demand for inclusive and culturally resonant cosmetic and personal care products. Industry leaders are capitalizing on the growing preference for products tailored to diverse skin tones and hair textures, which is reshaping market dynamics significantly. Market Size and Overview The Global Black Beauty Market size is estimated to be valued at USD 8.96 billion in 2025 and is expected to reach USD 23.11 billion by 2032, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.5% from 2025 to 2032. Black Beauty Market Forecast indicates strong market opportunities fueled by rising awareness, product innovation, and expanded retail penetration. The market report highlights an escalating market revenue trajectory driven by the increasing demand for specialty skincare, cosmetics, and hair care products that address unique needs within the Black community. Impact of Geopolitical Situation on Supply Chain A notable real-world example is the US-China trade tariffs implemented in late 2024, which disrupted the supply of essential botanical extracts and synthetic ingredients vital to Black beauty formulations. This led to increased procurement costs for key players, compelling shifts toward nearshoring and strengthened supplier diversification in North America and Africa. Consequently, market growth strategies shifted to mitigate supply risks, ensuring steady market size expansion despite geopolitical turbulence. SWOT Analysis - Strengths: - Growing consumer demand for culturally attuned products is bolstering market revenue and industry size. - Enhanced R&D and personalization technologies increase market share and business growth potential. - Strong brand loyalty among core consumers fuels stable revenue streams. - Weaknesses: - Dependency on international raw materials exposes supply chains to geopolitical and economic uncertainties. - Regulatory compliance costs, especially in major markets like the EU, present ongoing market restraints. - Fragmented market segments in emerging regions limit rapid scalability. - Opportunities: - Rising e-commerce adoption in developing markets is expanding market scope and revenue streams. - Sustainability trends open markets for innovative natural and eco-friendly Black beauty products. - Strategic collaborations between market players and local manufacturers to optimize supply chains. - Threats: - Intensifying competition from niche and indie brands could dilute market share among established players. - Economic downturns and inflationary pressures might restrain consumer discretionary spending. - Political instability in key sourcing regions continues to threaten uninterrupted raw material flow.

tw_sl_5da78be4f42c33a255d7d0bcf2f0f026,"  C elebrities ARE venturing beyond the billboard and the big screen—and into big business. Hailey Bieber, a model married to Justin, recently sold Rhode, her make-up brand, in a deal valued at as much as $1bn. Skims, a shapewear label founded by Kim Kardashian, a reality- TV star, makes $1bn in annual sales and is expected to list on the stockmarket soon. Rihanna is now a billionaire not directly because of her music, but thanks to Fenty Beauty, her make-up label. Ryan Reynolds, a Hollywood actor, is active in everything from telecoms to online privacy. Surprisingly, many of these superstar businesses have become a source of innovative new consumer products. Celebrities have long used their fame to peddle things. Michael Jordan, a basketball player, is thought to have made over $1.5bn from his partnership with Nike over the past 40 years. Nespresso has reportedly paid George Clooney more than $40m to have his mug selling its coffee. Two decades ago Hulk Hogan, a professional wrestler, helped market the “Hulkster” cheeseburger, pre-cooked and frozen for your convenience. The practice continues. This week President Donald Trump launched “Victory 45-47”, a line of fragrances for men and women priced at $249, having launched “Fight Fight Fight” ($199) last year. By contrast, the new superstar brands put the A -list into capitalist. Ms Bieber and co are involved in operations and hold equity stakes of varying sizes in the underlying businesses. Many celebs have begun to rethink the value of traditional endorsement and licensing deals. Social media now give them a line straight to their fans. Direct-to-consumer distribution, meanwhile, has made getting a product to market easier than ever. Given that the real money is in building and owning a brand , rather than advertising, why not launch one instead? This thinking in turn is altering the life-cycle of consumer goods. Just as pharmaceutical giants acquire biotech startups to refresh their drug pipelines, so consumer giants are buying up the most successful celebrity brands. The match makes sense. The hardest part of building a brand is the first 100,000 sales, but the A -list has a fan base that is well disposed towards them and their wares. Once a celebrity brand gets off the ground, a consumer giant has the production and distribution networks to help it grow. Hence the series of deals. Among the first was Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics, a headphones and streaming business co-founded by Dr Dre, a music producer. Many were shocked when the tech giant, which prides itself on in-house research and design, paid around $3bn for the brand in 2014. More recently Diageo, a drinksmaker, has bought a tequila firm co-owned by Mr Clooney, in a deal valued at around $1bn, and a gin distiller partly owned by Mr Reynolds, for up to $610m. Obviously, a famous name is not enough on its own to get a second-rate product flying off the shelves. You need only peer into the bargain bin in any cosmetics shop to spot the remainders of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's beauty products, or Sarah Jessica Parker's scents. Some of Mr Trump's newest offerings may soon join them. According to a perfume-review website, Victory 45-47 for men is “not particularly memorable”. Shoppers today are quick to review products on social media. Fans might try a new lipstick or t -shirt produced by a celebrity. But they will not buy it a second time if they are disappointed. At their best, celebrity brands are innovative, creative—and lucrative for their owners. Yet, just like show business, brutal flops are possible, too. ■ Subscribers to The Economist can sign up to our Opinion newsletter , which brings together the best of our leaders, columns, guest essays and reader correspondence.

tw_sl_b6e15685b8620f55b3ae75c177d49f6f,"  Remember when celebrity endorsements meant awkward TV ads with stars clutching products they'd probably never use? Those days are long gone. Today's star entrepreneurs aren't just lending their names to existing products; they're building real brands from scratch, and some are absolutely smashing it (in line with the best rebrands). Because while fame gets a brand noticed, what keeps people coming back is authentic storytelling, smart positioning, and understanding what your audience wants. And that's something we can all learn from. So let's dive into what's working and why. 01. Rihanna: Fenty Beauty Barbadian singer Rihanna (real name Robyn Rihanna Fenty) is one of the wealthiest and best-selling musicians of all time, with estimated sales of 250 million records, as well as being a successful actor. In 2017 she launched Fenty Beauty, and it's now a billion-dollar business. Even more importantly, it's has forced the beauty industry to up their inclusivity game. Rihanna had a strong sense of what was wrong with beauty and wasn't afraid to fix it. As Hsu-Ying Fullick, executive creative director at Landor, explains: ""Her tag line of 'beauty for all' was reflected in the debut of 40 foundation shades. She mandated that retailers stock the full range, refusing to allow her brand to be limited to lighter, more popular tones. This genuine commitment to diversity made waves, ensuring the brand was seen, noticed and celebrated."" ""Fenty didn't just sell makeup,"" he concludes. ""It sold a story that people could support. I also admired how the packaging was simple and clean, using sleek, minimal colours and graphics that supported rather than overpowered Rihanna's vision."" Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. ""There are many 'celebrity brands' where the famous face is simply an ambassador,"" adds Fura Johannesdottir, global CCO at Interbrand. ""Fenty Beauty could not be more different. It's Rihanna's brand vision with a strong purpose and she seems heavily involved."" And it's had a huge impact. ""Fenty Beauty changed the game in the beauty category by solving a real issue: the lack of inclusive makeup for all skin tones,"" Fura explains. ""Its darkest shade of foundation sold out almost immediately after the launch; clearly there was a real need for it."" Many celeb brands feel fake or performative. ""But Fenty still feels fresh due to its personality and genuineness,"" says Hsu-Ying. ""It reminds us that authenticity and purpose are the most powerful branding tools we can ever have."" 02. Jessica Alba: The Honest Company Jessica Alba made her name as an actor in TV drama Dark Angel and the Fantastic Four movies. But she's got serious business chops too. The Honest Company, which she launched in 2011, focuses on safe, eco-friendly products for babies and households. It's now pulling in record revenue of $378 million a year, reportedly making her more money than her entire Hollywood career. It's important to stress that she isn't phoning it in. ""This is not name-only endorsement,"" says Alan Young, joint CCO at St Luke's. ""Jessica Alba has been heavily involved in product development, read studies, hired scientists and experts, and spent three years developing the range before launch."" The brand positions itself as the trustworthy option in a market full of dodgy claims. As Jason Braddy, ECD at Elmwood Singapore, explains: ""It succeeded because it positioned itself as a challenger in a category filled with distrust. Jessica Alba's credibility as a parent, not just a celebrity, provides a strong and real emotional anchor that resonates with consumers. And consistency, distinctiveness, and best-in-class storytelling have all helped sell this story."" The visual branding is spot-on too, with Craig praising its simplicity and directness. ""At its heart is a roundel, locking together the Honest name and butterfly icon,"" he explains. ""This stamp of honest authority cuts through the clutter: a memorable reassurance of trust parents will keep coming back to. ""This simplicity allows the rest of the branding – cute colours and patterns – to pull products and ranges apart and complement aspirational nursery interiors."" 03. Emma Chamberlain: Chamberlain Coffee Emma Chamberlain is the YouTuber who pretty much invented the ""messy, relatable influencer"" aesthetic everyone's copying now. She has a huge Gen Z following, and a knack for making everything feel real and unfiltered. In 2019, she launched Chamberlain Coffee, and it's found a natural home in the youth market....","Remember when celebrity endorsements meant awkward TV ads with stars clutching products they'd probably never use?

18101791264574156,"  Seit einer Weile teste ich den Maybelline Lifter Glaze Lip Oil Balm in der Farbe Berry Haze. Erst hatte mich das Produkt irgendwie nicht so angesprochen, aber der niedrige Preis von rund 5 Euro und der kleine aber feine Hype auf Social Media haben dafür gesorgt, dass ich das Produkt dann doch mal mitgenommen habe. Ich war neulich erst erstaunt, dass ein ähnliches Produkt von Manhattan so viel teurer war, daher finde ich 5 Euro für Maybelline echt nicht zu teuer. Das Design vom Produkt ist schlicht, gefällt mir aber schon gut. Vielleicht hätte man das Packaging noch an die Farbe des Produkts anpassen können, aber wollen wir mal keine Wunder erwarten. Das Produkt verspricht Pflege und Farbe in einem und “zart getönte Lippen”. Nun habe ich eine relativ dunkle Farbe genommen, finde aber, dass es für mich eher zur Kategorie dekorative Kosmetik als zur Kategorie Lippenpflege gehört. Oftmals sind solche Lippenpflegestifte, die auch Farbe haben, eher störend und schmierig, das ist hier nicht der Fall. Trotzdem finde ich ""zart getönte Lippen"" trifft es irgendwie gut. Ich finde, dass man bei meiner Farbe einen sehr hübschen mavig/rosanen my lips but better Look bekommt, aber auch keinen super spiegelden Glosseffekt, nicht wie zum Beispiel bei Fenty Beauty. Dafür merkt man das Produkt aber auch kaum auf den Lippen, das ist sehr angenehm. Ich merke, dass ich immer wieder zum Lifter Glaze greife und zu ""Marktforschungszwecken"" (😜) habe ich jetzt auch noch eine zweite Farbe gekauft. Ich bin mal gespannt, wie meine Meinung dort ausfallen wird, denn die Farbe ist deutlich heller. All in all bin ich ein bisschen leidenschaftslos. Das Produkt gefällt mir gut. Ich greife immer wieder dazu, auch wenn ich nun wirklich auch andere Produkte da hätte. Die Farbe gefällt mir sehr gut und passt zu den meisten Makeups. Für den Preis kann man sich das auf jeden Fall mal anschauen, ist aber für mich jetzt kein weltbewegendes must-have Produkt. Kennt ihr die Lifter Glaze Lip Balms von Maybelline? Gefallen sie euch? Welche Farben habt ihr gekauft? #maybellinelifterglaze #maybelline #neuinderdrogerie #neubeidm #neubeirossmann #beautyblogger_de #lippenstiftliebe","Seit einer Weile teste ich den Maybelline Lifter Glaze Lip Oil Balm in der Farbe Berry Haze.
