1lprdn3,"‚Äâ Hello guys ! I am an amateur perfume collector. I only own a couple of Perfumes and would love to grow my collection. Here are the Perfumes I currently own/owned and will repurchase: Macaron d'amande by Jeanne arthes : cheap vanilla almond gourmand, great for layering with summery scents. Khair pistachio: I like it its just more sweet than nutty. Would love a recommendation for a nuttier pistachio scent. Delice nacr√©: cheap perfect signature scent. It's clean musky sweet and slightly floral. I hate floral Perfumes but this one is just perfect. (I looked for this EVERYWHERE but couldn't find it only on Amazon for triple the original price:((  i am almost running out) Eclaire: I like it but it's too cloying. Sol de Janeiro 62 : I like it but honestly not worth the price ://. Eilish n1: perfect winter scent I get lots of compliments from it. Based on my current collection please tell me whether these Perfumes would be a good purchase (I love vanilla, plain, sweet, slightly spicy but not too much. I also like gourmand pistachios, caramels ans musky clean scents) I am planning to add to my collection (never smelled any of these): Delice ambr√©: giving that delice nacr√© is my signature scent I thought I would enjoy this too . Kenzo amour. Britney spears intimate fantasy. Latte Abyad. Juliette has a gun vanilla vibes. Kayali Capri in a bottle. Shaghaf oud tonka.

I am scrubbing immediately 2. Very underwhelming, probably would not purchase OR scrubbed but would give a second chance 3. Somewhat enjoyable, didn't scrub, could maybe try this again in the future 4. I am probably going to size up from the sample size, I enjoyed this 5. I love it, full size full size full size **Moon Bathing-** *""Lychee fruit, milk, vanilla, jasmine grandiflorum, salt""* Woah. The freshness/tart of the lychee balances the laconic of the milk and sweetness of the vanilla perfectly. This is a fruity gourmand in the best way possible. The light pink is gorgeous, this song smells like Pink in the Night by Mitski if you've ever heard it. I do not smell the salt but maybe it's just what's contributing to the ‚Äútart‚Äù of the lychee which I adore. As time progresses you can kind of get that floral in the background too. Which I would usually say I could do without but here it builds a solid base. Vibes are definitely light, delicate, fem, fruity, youthful but reserved, clean 4.5/5 **Parakeet-** *""Fizzy grapefruit soda, freshly picked daisies, tiny forget-me-nots, and the powdery sweet down feathers of a well groomed parakeet""* Omg why am I slowly coming to realize I love tart?! This smells like a Sweetart/tart candy to me. I think it's the grapefruit that does this. It's very beautiful and summer ish! This is what I would imagine that very pricey Odette fragrance with the swan on it smells like. However, I really do wish the dry down was as effervescent and pretty as the opening. You do still get hits of that grapefruit throughout, but it does become floral dominant and lose some of that fizzy soda aspect (which it does indeed capture perfectly). I feel very split on this only because I think the daisy note isn't for me but I would honestly recommend this to anyone who wants a fizzy grapefruit citrus soda flowery vibe. Of note: My boyfriend, who has to be the pickiest person on earth (maybe I only say this because I subject him to bakery level gourmands which he is not a fan of) LOVES THIS. 3/5 **Alibi-** *""Passionfruit, orange blossom, guava, strawberry yuzu lemonade, and a dash of coconut cream over a rosewood base""* More tart! But this means full tropical and it is beautiful. It is sexy, fruity, tropical, tart, and unapologetic. This immediately transports me to Maui. The coconut keeps it balanced, you can get a dash of it throughout. Personally it leans too fruity and juicy for me. Like you really do smell like a mix of red fruits. I do get the name though, you smell so delicious it's almost too good to be true. This is a great fragrance for sure but it is just not for me personally. 3/5 **A Dog Named Pam-** *""Juniper berry, petitgrain, bitter orange, red mandarin, cedarwood, palo santo, and a warm fuzzy musk that feels to me like the hot belly of a clean dog""* This is what I think Nami from One Piece would smell like. This is a new HG for me. This is bitter orange without being too astringent or violent on the nose....","I had been so curious about them and haven't seen many reviews, so I figured I would post mine!

It layers gorgeously with any perfume that has a bit of spice. Rifaaqat and Lattafa Sehr are not to my liking. I bought both and they smell like gasoline. Rifaaqat turns into a cheap smelling musk after a few hours. Sehr has never made it that long before I had to wash it off. Lattafa Artisan Ethnique is spicy vanilla with a hint of rum.

It feels like being retro, tough and elegant all at the same time. Paris Corner Vanilla Mood is an interesting one.
