Here are a few things that excited, motivated and challenged me this year so far, with a huge thanks to those who supported along the way: 1. January - Traveled to Vietnam✅a bucket list place. While a personal trip, new places and culture always recharge and inspire me when I get back to work🌍. 2. February - Back to my Alma Mateur Hofstra University📚 to visit the SHE-EOS Women's Business Club💪🏼. It's always a highlight to share my journey and what I learned since being in the classroom. I'm still learning… 3. March - My first Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios Premiere🎬 events in NYC. It's amazing to see the behind-the-scenes of these launches. We even got to meet the parents of a debut actor in the film, who beamed with pride🥹. My client personally introduced herself to Kevin 🥓, so that was incredible. 4. April - Are we still celebrating in-person client events👏🏼? I sure am. The energy of brainstorming🧠 and celebrating🎉 in-person is like no other. Good ideas, and great company. 5. May - Mixing my personal joys with career firsts, I traveled to Hamburg, Germany for the 2025 OMR Festival 👩‍💻. Highlights were, of course, cheering on Kory Marchisotto & Rina Yashayeva for their keynote presentations. E.L.F. BEAUTY 💄continues to be a company I admire, for its creativity, but ultimately its accessibility to the beauty masses. Second - the sheer intelligence 🤯and evolution before my eyes. I saw presenters across industries share, truly, what makes their companies great. I loved being a student for two days, learning about the future of AI💻, what makes a company a good employer, and all things Scott Galloway had to share on predictions for the year. I had the chance to meet with our Amazon team across the pond, too! 6. June - With the wave 🌊of new hires joining CPG, I launched the first CPG Back to Basics Training Program📝, bringing tenured AMs as presenters to share client wins and challenges, best practices, and the “how tos” that often get lost in the chapters of onboarding.

The U.S. color cosmetics market was valued at USD 21.52 billion in 2024, with projections indicating a rise to USD 35.52 billion by 2030, demonstrating a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.8% during the forecast period of 2025 to 2030. This expansion is significantly propelled by the growth of e-commerce and technological advancements that have revolutionized the industry. Consumers now have easier access to a diverse array of products, while brands can engage with a wider audience through digital channels. Innovations like augmented reality (AR) virtual try-ons have elevated the online shopping experience, allowing users to visualize products before purchase, thereby enhancing both convenience and personalization. Social media platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, have become instrumental in shaping beauty trends and influencing consumer choices. Beauty influencers and makeup artists leverage these platforms to share tutorials, product reviews, and new techniques, directly impacting purchasing decisions. Brands are increasingly utilizing social media for product launches, audience engagement, and the creation of viral trends to boost sales and cultivate brand loyalty. A notable trend in 2024 is the rapid growth of the men's grooming and skincare market, driven by evolving societal norms and the strong influence of platforms like TikTok, where hashtags such as #mensskincare have gained widespread popularity. This trend reflects a shifting perspective on masculinity, encouraging more men to adopt skincare and beauty routines, prompting brands to develop product lines specifically tailored for male consumers. Key Market Dynamics & Insights: Facial Color Cosmetics Dominance: In 2024, facial color cosmetics held a share of approximately 39.03% of the U.S. color cosmetics market. This is attributed to their fundamental role in daily beauty routines and the extensive range of products within this category.

That said, I'd rather have healthy skin, and the weather in my region is extremely hot in the summer and very cold in the winter) * I will be using that one product all over my face thinly for when I have events and such, but I only do that when there is something going on which is maximum 12 times a year and maybe even less. * Is actually worth the money (no fading, caking, or separating) **Budget for makeup:** I'd rather avoid expensive products that break the bank, but I'm willing to spend if it's something I'll truly use and not regret buying.

mov_9D08993078E11A85C9A929168894607B,"  Startups are declaring victory everywhere. Pepsi spent a monumental $2 billion for Poppi. E.l.f. cosmetics wired $1 billion to Hailey Bieber for Rhode. Most recently, Unilever swooped up Dr.Squatch for $1.5 billion. Most recently, start-up politician Zohran Mamdani upset Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral primary. Back in February, Mamdani was polling at a negligible one percent. He trounced Cuomo by 43.1 percent to 34.5 percent.

Pepsi spent a monumental $2 billion for Poppi. E.l.f. cosmetics wired $1 billion to Hailey Bieber for Rhode. Most recently, Unilever swooped up Dr.Squatch for $1.5 billion. Most recently, start-up politician Zohran Mamdani upset Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral primary. Back in February, Mamdani was polling at a negligible one percent. He trounced Cuomo by 43.1 percent to 34.5 percent.

mov_7F13C1D100441F95585B55B3DE4496D4,"  Scooter Braun is transitioning his role at HYBE, the South Korean entertainment giant, moving from CEO of HYBE America to an advisory position which will have him joining the HYBE Board of Directors as a director and a senior advisor to chairman and CEO Bang Si-Hyuk. The move marks the end of a five-year run at HYBE, which is home to such K-pop acts as BTS and Katseye. The news was announced to HYBE staffers on Monday when Braun, dialing in from David Geffen's yacht where he is vacationing, notified employees that the move was “in the works for quite some time,” according to a source who adds that the five-year plan was initiated with the sale of Braun's Ithaca Holdings to HYBE in 2021. Braun will remain active in current HYBE projects, like the just-launched girl group Katseye. Braun intimated that he “isn't going anywhere” and will “still help guide” the artists on the HYBE roster. During the call, Braun shared with the staff that, when he set out for a career in music 25 years ago, it was after reading the Geffen biography The Operator. Today, as he closes this chapter of his career, he reminded his colleagues of what he's learned from Geffen: “Follow your dreams and anything can happen.” Braun built his business managing music artists like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, J Balvin, Demi Lovato and The Kid LAROI under the SB Projects banner. In 2024, he stepped away from the management business, announcing his decision on social media, where he noted, “I have been blessed to have had a 'Forrest Gump'-like life while witnessing and taking part in the journeys of some of the most extraordinarily talented people the world has ever seen. I'm constantly pinching myself and asking 'how did I get here?'” The exit from management coincided with a split from Bieber which turned contemptuous, as THR reported in April, due to financial consequences triggered by the cancelation of Bieber's Justice tour in 2022. In not fulfilling his contractual obligation to AEG (the tour's promoter) and completing the concert dates, for which he received a $40 million advance, Bieber was left owing more than $20 million to AEG. Then-manager Braun, through his company, covered what was owed in the form of a loan at a highly favorable (to Bieber) rate. In addition, the two were partnered in a number of other businesses including a record label and film projects. Braun also helped secure a $200 million catalog deal for Bieber's songwriting interests, possibly the largest nest egg in music history for an artist under 30. (Worth noting: Hailey Bieber, who married Justin in 2018, recently sold her Rhode Beauty skincare brand to e.l.f. Beauty for $1 billion; Braun was a seed investor.) THR has learned that a settlement between Braun and Bieber is now completed. “Scooter and Justin squashed their issues and are in a good place,” says a source who adds that Braun's last act at HYBE was to close the book on the squabble and “leave the company, and Justin, in a good position.” Reps for Bieber declined to comment on the settlement. Stepping into the CEO position in Braun's place and leading all day-to-day duties is Isaac Lee, who has been chairman of HYBE Latin America since November of 2023. Lee's new title is chairman and CEO of HYBE Americas. In addition to running HYBE's operations in Mexico, Miami, and Medellin, Lee will also have oversight of Nashville-based Big Machine Label Group (BMLG) and Quality Control Media Holdings, headquartered in Atlanta. While Braun's next move is unclear, HYBE chief Bang Si-Hyuk commented, “Scooter has been an extraordinary partner, a visionary executive, and a true catalyst for cultural exchange. His contributions have been vital in establishing our ambitious presence in the U.S. market. I am deeply grateful for his leadership, his astute instincts and his unwavering passion for artists. We wish him immense success in his exciting next chapter and look forward to continuing our partnership in executing HYBE's global vision.” More in Business Braun also remains one of HYBE's largest individual shareholders. In announcing his new role, Braun said: “Being a part of HYBE and witnessing its remarkable growth has been one of the most inspiring chapters of my professional journey. Chairman Bang is a true visionary and a musical genius. What he has built with HYBE is unparalleled. I am incredibly proud of our collective accomplishments and look forward to supporting Chairman Bang and CEO Jason Jaesang Lee in their continued success as I step into what's next.”","Scooter Braun is transitioning his role at HYBE, the South Korean entertainment giant, moving from CEO of HYBE America to an advisory position which will have him joining the HYBE Board of Directors as a director and a senior advisor to chairman and CEO Bang Si-Hyuk.

mov_7C83FE67E2C3B97E9693C075A96233D4,"  NEW YORK (AP) — Fashion “dupes,” or less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories, are just about everywhere these days. They're also drawing some businesses into legal battles. In the latest example, Lululemon slapped a lawsuit against Costco on Friday, accusing the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure apparel. Across the retail industry, it's far from a new phenomenon. But social media is pushing the culture of online dupe shopping to new heights as influencers direct their followers to where they can buy the knockoffs. Want a taste of Hermès' $1,000 fuzzy slippers? Target has a version for $15. Looking for a $2,800 price Bottega Veneta hobo bag? There's a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas. It's not even the first time Lululemon has encountered what it says are knockoffs of its clothing, which often carry steep price tags of over $100 each for leggings and sporty zip-ups. Without specifying additional sellers beyond Costco in Friday's complaint, Lululemon noted that a handful companies have “replicated or copied” its apparel to sell cheaper offerings — including those popularized online through hashtags like “LululemonDupes” on TikTok and other social media platforms. Dupes aren't new For years, marketers have rolled out less expensive fashion and beauty alternatives for consumers to buy instead of pricey designer brands. Unlike more traditional counterfeits, which are illegal copies of the product that feature an unauthorized trademark or logo of a patented brand, “pure” dupes that resemble certain features of more expensive products are generally legitimate. They can even spark awareness of the original items. But the rising frenzy for dupes signals that many shoppers want a taste of luxury, but no longer want to pay for (or care about) getting the real thing. Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Hermès' coveted Birkin bag. The $78 item — sold by Kamugo, which doesn't appear to have its own website — was a fraction of the price of the original, which goes from $9,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars on resale and auction sites. Influencers labeled the leather bag a “wirkin.” Other suppliers including BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy were listed on Walmart's site selling similar totes. When dupes venture into uncertain legal territory Experts say some dupes move into shaky legal territory, including copyright and trademark infringement, particularly when a dupe marketer makes false claims about the duplicate or the original. Look-alikes can also frustrate the targeted companies. Following the viral fame of the “wirkin,” for example, Hermès Executive Chairman Axel Dumas said he was “irritated” and “annoyed” by the cheaper look-alikes. “Making a copy like this is quite detestable,” Dumas said in a corporate earnings call in February. Still, he acknowledged that it was “quite touching” to see so many consumers want a bag with the Birkin style — and that “difference in quality” was still evident, noting that nobody bought the dupe thinking it was from Hermès. Meanwhile, Benefit sued E.l.f. for trademark infringement over its $6 Lash 'N Roll mascara, which is similar to Benefit's $29 Roller Lash mascara. But in December, a California judge found that E.l.f.'s mascara didn't deceive shoppers and didn't infringe the trademarks and trade dress of Benefit's item. That was the first lawsuit of its kind in E.l.f.'s 20-year-history, and the judge's decision was “a resounding win for us,” CEO Tarang Amin previously told The Associated Press. Amin doesn't like to call his version dupes, referring to them as “holy grails"" instead. “The basic reality is we always put our E.l.f. twist on it,” he said. “It's an E.l.f. product that's a much better value.” Lululemon sues Costco In its lawsuit, Lululemon argued that Costco had “unlawfully traded” on Lululemon's reputation and that it was suing as part of wider intellectual property enforcement “directed to retailers who have chosen to copy rather than compete.” A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Costco on the lawsuit. The litigation could be more complicated because Lululemon also alleges that customers know Costco uses manufacturers of popular branded products for its private label Kirkland brand, although the companies involved don't reveal that information. Due to this, Lululemon claims at least some shoppers may believe that Kirkland-branded products are made by the authentic supplier of the “original” products. Lululemon accuses Costco of making duplicates of several producings, including its popular Scuba hoodies, Define jackets and ABC pants. Lululemon says one of the duplicates that Costco sells is the Hi-Tec Men's Scuba Full Zip, with the lawsuit showing a screenshot image of Costco's website showing the item priced at $19.97. Lululemon found itself in a similar dispute with Peloton back in 2021, when it sued the exercise bike company over alleged “copycat products” in its then-new clothing lines. Two years later, the companies announced a five-year partnership that included Lululemon becoming the primary athletic apparel partner to Peloton. —- AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report.","NEW YORK (AP) — Fashion “dupes,” or less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories, are just about everywhere these days.

mov_3CE8AB713D0909178739051EEE8553BD,"  NEW YORK (AP) — Fashion “dupes,” or less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories, are just about everywhere these days. They're also drawing some businesses into legal battles. In the latest example, Lululemon slapped a lawsuit against Costco on Friday, accusing the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure apparel. Across the retail industry, it's far from a new phenomenon. But social media is pushing the culture of online dupe shopping to new heights as influencers direct their followers to where they can buy the knockoffs. Want a taste of Hermès' $1,000 fuzzy slippers? Target has a version for $15. Looking for a $2,800 price Bottega Veneta hobo bag? There's a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas. It's not even the first time Lululemon has encountered what it says are knockoffs of its clothing, which often carry steep price tags of over $100 each for leggings and sporty zip-ups. Without specifying additional sellers beyond Costco in Friday's complaint, Lululemon noted that a handful companies have “replicated or copied” its apparel to sell cheaper offerings — including those popularized online through hashtags like “LululemonDupes” on TikTok and other social media platforms. Dupes aren't new For years, marketers have rolled out less expensive fashion and beauty alternatives for consumers to buy instead of pricey designer brands. Unlike more traditional counterfeits, which are illegal copies of the product that feature an unauthorized trademark or logo of a patented brand, “pure” dupes that resemble certain features of more expensive products are generally legitimate. They can even spark awareness of the original items. But the rising frenzy for dupes signals that many shoppers want a taste of luxury, but no longer want to pay for (or care about) getting the real thing. Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Hermès' coveted Birkin bag. The $78 item — sold by Kamugo, which doesn't appear to have its own website — was a fraction of the price of the original, which goes from $9,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars on resale and auction sites. Influencers labeled the leather bag a “wirkin.” Other suppliers including BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy were listed on Walmart's site selling similar totes. When dupes venture into uncertain legal territory Experts say some dupes move into shaky legal territory, including copyright and trademark infringement, particularly when a dupe marketer makes false claims about the duplicate or the original. Look-alikes can also frustrate the targeted companies. Following the viral fame of the “wirkin,” for example, Hermès Executive Chairman Axel Dumas said he was “irritated” and “annoyed” by the cheaper look-alikes. “Making a copy like this is quite detestable,” Dumas said in a corporate earnings call in February. Still, he acknowledged that it was “quite touching” to see so many consumers want a bag with the Birkin style — and that “difference in quality” was still evident, noting that nobody bought the dupe thinking it was from Hermès. Meanwhile, Benefit sued E.l.f. for trademark infringement over its $6 Lash 'N Roll mascara, which is similar to Benefit's $29 Roller Lash mascara. But in December, a California judge found that E.l.f.'s mascara didn't deceive shoppers and didn't infringe the trademarks and trade dress of Benefit's item.

mov_C9B5B4B5E4B6307D3255699BF1EC5579,"  NEW YORK (AP) — Fashion “dupes,” or less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories, are just about everywhere these days. They're also drawing some businesses into legal battles. NEW YORK (AP) — Fashion “dupes,” or less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories, are just about everywhere these days. They're also drawing some businesses into legal battles. In the latest example, Lululemon slapped a lawsuit against Costco on Friday, accusing the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure apparel. Across the retail industry, it's far from a new phenomenon. But social media is pushing the culture of online dupe shopping to new heights as influencers direct their followers to where they can buy the knockoffs. Want a taste of Hermès' $1,000 fuzzy slippers? Target has a version for $15. Looking for a $2,800 price Bottega Veneta hobo bag? There's a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas. It's not even the first time Lululemon has encountered what it says are knockoffs of its clothing, which often carry steep price tags of over $100 each for leggings and sporty zip-ups. Without specifying additional sellers beyond Costco in Friday's complaint, Lululemon noted that a handful companies have “replicated or copied” its apparel to sell cheaper offerings — including those popularized online through hashtags like “LululemonDupes” on TikTok and other social media platforms. Dupes aren't new For years, marketers have rolled out less expensive fashion and beauty alternatives for consumers to buy instead of pricey designer brands. Unlike more traditional counterfeits, which are illegal copies of the product that feature an unauthorized trademark or logo of a patented brand, “pure” dupes that resemble certain features of more expensive products are generally legitimate. They can even spark awareness of the original items. But the rising frenzy for dupes signals that many shoppers want a taste of luxury, but no longer want to pay for (or care about) getting the real thing. Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Hermès' coveted Birkin bag. The $78 item — sold by Kamugo, which doesn't appear to have its own website — was a fraction of the price of the original, which goes from $9,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars on resale and auction sites. Influencers labeled the leather bag a “wirkin.” Other suppliers including BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy were listed on Walmart's site selling similar totes. When dupes venture into uncertain legal territory Experts say some dupes move into shaky legal territory, including copyright and trademark infringement, particularly when a dupe marketer makes false claims about the duplicate or the original. Look-alikes can also frustrate the targeted companies. Following the viral fame of the “wirkin,” for example, Hermès Executive Chairman Axel Dumas said he was “irritated” and “annoyed” by the cheaper look-alikes. “Making a copy like this is quite detestable,” Dumas said in a corporate earnings call in February. Still, he acknowledged that it was “quite touching” to see so many consumers want a bag with the Birkin style — and that “difference in quality” was still evident, noting that nobody bought the dupe thinking it was from Hermès. Meanwhile, Benefit sued E.l.f. for trademark infringement over its $6 Lash 'N Roll mascara, which is similar to Benefit's $29 Roller Lash mascara. But in December, a California judge found that E.l.f.'s mascara didn't deceive shoppers and didn't infringe the trademarks and trade dress of Benefit's item. That was the first lawsuit of its kind in E.l.f.'s 20-year-history, and the judge's decision was “a resounding win for us,” CEO Tarang Amin previously told The Associated Press. Amin doesn't like to call his version dupes, referring to them as “holy grails"" instead. “The basic reality is we always put our E.l.f. twist on it,” he said. “It's an E.l.f. product that's a much better value.” Lululemon sues Costco In its lawsuit, Lululemon argued that Costco had “unlawfully traded” on Lululemon's reputation and that it was suing as part of wider intellectual property enforcement “directed to retailers who have chosen to copy rather than compete.” A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Costco on the lawsuit. The litigation could be more complicated because Lululemon also alleges that customers know Costco uses manufacturers of popular branded products for its private label Kirkland brand, although the companies involved don't reveal that information. Due to this, Lululemon claims at least some shoppers may believe that Kirkland-branded products are made by the authentic supplier of the “original” products. Lululemon accuses Costco of making duplicates of several producings, including its popular Scuba hoodies, Define jackets and ABC pants.

mov_431EAF1298CDBDD531BB66CC6F17D6A1,"  SPR_COMBO[ja]ブランド担当者こそ、この変化を見逃してはいけない。 「新しいキャンペーンを投下してもロイヤリティが高まらない」そんな企業マーケティングの“あるある”に、Cannes Lions 2025※1が明確なヒントをくれました。 企業でマーケティングやブランドを担当している皆さんにとって、Cannes Lionsは少し“遠い世界”に感じるかもしれません。 華やかなCMを表彰する祭典、そう思われている方も多いでしょう。 でも、実際に現地で話を聞いていると、むしろ今、企業側で日々マーケティングを回している人たちこそ見るべき内容ばかりだと感じました。 「データと感性のバランス」「ブランドパーパスの形骸化への問い直し」「AI時代の本当のクリエイティブとは何か」など、どれも今すぐ実務に関係するテーマです。 私自身も昨年に引き続き現地で参加しレポートを書いていますが、今年は特に“今すぐ実務に活かせる示唆”が多く、より深く感じる部分がありました。 「変わらない物語を軸にしながら、いかに接点を横断的に構築するか」それが今、世界中の優れたブランドに共通して見られる潮流だったからです。 このレポートでは、Mt.MELVIL（本社：Los Angeles, CA、CEO/エクゼクティブプロデューサー：村田未来子　日本支社：東京都渋谷区、CEO/エクゼクティブプロデューサー：山脇 愛理）のビジネスマネージャーとして、そして元・企業マーケターとして、Cannes Lions 2025の現地で得た“リアルな空気”をお届けします。 単なるセッションのまとめではなく、「明日から自社のマーケティングにどう活かせるか？」 という視点で抽出したヒントと問いを中心にお伝えします。 気温も熱気も最高潮のCannes会場より 【1. ストーリーの芯がブランドに“複利”をもたらす】 PepsiCo, Inc.（以下、PepsiCo）のGlobal CMOであるジェーン・ウェイクリー氏は、セッションで、「創造性は目的のない表現ではなく、成長のための手段である」と語り、食文化との結びつきがブランドのカテゴリー拡張においていかに重要かを強調しました。 Lay'sやCheetosなどの事例を通じて、“日常の中の物語を通じたブランド体験の再構築”が、事業成長と深く関係していることが示されました。 PepsiCoの元マーケティングVPであり、現在はKraft Heinz North AmericaのCMOを務めるトッド・カプラン氏は、ブランドとはリレーションシップであり、そこにはストーリーが欠かせないという姿勢を一貫して示してきました。 彼はこれまでも、一過性のバズではなく、語るべき“核”を定め、すべてのチャネルで繰り返し伝えていくことの重要性を主張しており、その考えは現在のブランドづくりにも通底しています。 この視点は、YouTube, LLC（以下、YouTube）CEOのニール・モーハン氏の「長く支持されるブランドは、語るべき“信念”を変えていない」という言葉とも重なります。 動画プラットフォームとして20年の軌跡を持つYouTubeは、変化し続けるテクノロジーの中でも、表現者とファンの“絆”を中心に据えたブランド構築を続けています。 また、ドラマ『This Is Us』のクリエイターであるダン・フォーゲルマン氏は、「脚本家として最も信頼するのは“驚き”と“心の痛み”。 そこにこそ人は惹きつけられる」と語り、自身の母親の死や家族の記憶など、個人的体験に根ざしたストーリーテリングが最も深く観客と接続する、とその背景を明かしました。 感情に響く表現こそが、物語の本質であり、ブランドにも通じる要素だと感じさせました。 単なる“わかりやすさ”や“映え”ではなく、繰り返し語られ、深く刺さるストーリーこそが、ブランドと生活者の関係に“複利”をもたらす。 その本質を、改めて感じさせられるセッションでした。 【2. 複数部門グランプリに見る“接点の越境”】 今年のCannes Lionsでは、単一チャネルや単発施策にとどまらず、社会・生活者・企業の“接点”を横断して作用するキャンペーンが高く評価されました。 1つのアイデアが複数の部門（＝視点）で受賞する傾向が見られたことは、今の時代におけるブランドの「振る舞い」の重要性を示しています。 特に注目を集めたのが、フランス発の保険グループAXAの『Three Words』キャンペーンです。 このキャンペーンは、Titanium Grand Prix、Direct、Creative Business Transformationの3部門でグランプリを受賞しました。 さらに、Film、Health & Wellness、Entertainmentなど複数部門でもGoldやBronzeを獲得し、その成果がAXA全体の高い評価に貢献。 AXAはCannes Lions2025において「Creative Brand of the Year」に選出されました。 『Three Words』キャンペーンの仕掛けはシンプルでありながら革新的。 住宅保険の契約文に“and domestic violence”を追加することで、家庭内暴力の被害者に対して避難・法的・心理的支援を保険の対象に含めたのです。 制度設計、サービス改善、社会的啓発の複数の接点を越境する設計が、多面的に評価された要因です。 また、Unilever傘下のDoveのキャンペーン『The Dove Code』（『Real Beauty Redefined for the AI Era』）は、Media部門でGrand Prixを獲得し、Glass部門でもショートリストに選出されました。 このキャンペーンでは、AIが生成するビジュアルが子どもたちの美意識に与える影響に着目し、教育用映像と「Real Beauty Prompt Playbook」を展開。 テクノロジー、教育、ジェンダーの接点をまたぐ設計によって、ブランドの社会的姿勢が高く評価されました。 さらに、Instagramの『Caption with Intention』は、Digital Craft、Design、Brand Experience & Activationの3部門でグランプリを受賞。 視覚障害のあるユーザーのためにaltテキスト記述の啓発活動、UI設計改善、クリエイター教育を並行展開し、テックとヒューマンセンタードデザインの交点に立つブランドの姿勢が評価されました。 これらの事例に共通していたのは、一発のバズや映えるビジュアルではなく、さまざまな接点を越境しながら連鎖的にブランド体験をつくっていること。 現代におけるブランド価値とは、単一チャネルのインパクトではなく、行動・サービス・社会的文脈が横断的につながる構造によって決まることを、今年のグランプリたちは示していました。 【3. “感情”が、体験設計の起点になる時代へ】 e.l.f. BeautyのCMOであるコリー・マルキゾット氏は、「いまZ世代に刺さるのは、“完璧な映像”ではなく“リアルな共感”だ」と語りました。 完璧に編集されたビジュアルや脚本された言葉ではなく、むしろ未完成さや素直な表現の中に、ユーザーが自己を投影できる“余白”がある、そうした感性が支持を集めているという指摘でした。 e.l.f.は、TikTok上で自社の楽曲『Eyes. Lips. Face.』※2をバイラルヒットさせ、ユーザー生成コンテンツ戦略で注目を集めた後も、“共創型マーケティング”を軸にしたキャンペーン展開を続けています。 2024年から実施している、ジェンダーバイアスにユーモアで切り込んだ『So Many Dicks』キャンペーンが話題となり、Cannes Lions 2025ではCreative Data Lions部門（Use of Humor）でSilver Lionを受賞。 さらにTitanium Lionsのショートリストにも選出され、実績としても高く評価されました。 マルキゾット氏は「共創には、私たちが信じる“声”が必要だ」と強調し、「単なるエンタメではなく、“信念をもって語るストーリー”が、ロイヤリティと購買に直結する」と語っていました。 この「共感を起点としたストーリーテリング」は、単にSNSでの拡散を狙うものではなく、ブランドそのものの“人格”を表すものだとする視点は、非常に実践的です。 同様のテーマは、Hello Sunshineの創設者であり俳優・プロデューサーのリース・ウィザースプーン氏も共有していました。...","SPR_COMBO[ja]ブランド担当者こそ、この変化を見逃してはいけない。 「新しいキャンペーンを投下してもロイヤリティが高まらない」そんな企業マーケティングの“あるある”に、Cannes Lions 2025※1が明確なヒントをくれました。 企業でマーケティングやブランドを担当している皆さんにとって、Cannes Lionsは少し“遠い世界”に感じるかもしれません。 華やかなCMを表彰する祭典、そう思われている方も多いでしょう。 でも、実際に現地で話を聞いていると、むしろ今、企業側で日々マーケティングを回している人たちこそ見るべき内容ばかりだと感じました。 「データと感性のバランス」「ブランドパーパスの形骸化への問い直し」「AI時代の本当のクリエイティブとは何か」など、どれも今すぐ実務に関係するテーマです。 私自身も昨年に引き続き現地で参加しレポートを書いていますが、今年は特に“今すぐ実務に活かせる示唆”が多く、より深く感じる部分がありました。 「変わらない物語を軸にしながら、いかに接点を横断的に構築するか」それが今、世界中の優れたブランドに共通して見られる潮流だったからです。 このレポートでは、Mt.MELVIL（本社：Los Angeles, CA、CEO/エクゼクティブプロデューサー：村田未来子 日本支社：東京都渋谷区、CEO/エクゼクティブプロデューサー：山脇 愛理）のビジネスマネージャーとして、そして元・企業マーケターとして、Cannes Lions 2025の現地で得た“リアルな空気”をお届けします。 単なるセッションのまとめではなく、「明日から自社のマーケティングにどう活かせるか？」 という視点で抽出したヒントと問いを中心にお伝えします。 気温も熱気も最高潮のCannes会場より 【1. ストーリーの芯がブランドに“複利”をもたらす】 PepsiCo, Inc.（以下、PepsiCo）のGlobal CMOであるジェーン・ウェイクリー氏は、セッションで、「創造性は目的のない表現ではなく、成長のための手段である」と語り、食文化との結びつきがブランドのカテゴリー拡張においていかに重要かを強調しました。 Lay'sやCheetosなどの事例を通じて、“日常の中の物語を通じたブランド体験の再構築”が、事業成長と深く関係していることが示されました。 PepsiCoの元マーケティングVPであり、現在はKraft Heinz North AmericaのCMOを務めるトッド・カプラン氏は、ブランドとはリレーションシップであり、そこにはストーリーが欠かせないという姿勢を一貫して示してきました。 彼はこれまでも、一過性のバズではなく、語るべき“核”を定め、すべてのチャネルで繰り返し伝えていくことの重要性を主張しており、その考えは現在のブランドづくりにも通底しています。 この視点は、YouTube, LLC（以下、YouTube）CEOのニール・モーハン氏の「長く支持されるブランドは、語るべき“信念”を変えていない」という言葉とも重なります。 動画プラットフォームとして20年の軌跡を持つYouTubeは、変化し続けるテクノロジーの中でも、表現者とファンの“絆”を中心に据えたブランド構築を続けています。 また、ドラマ『This Is Us』のクリエイターであるダン・フォーゲルマン氏は、「脚本家として最も信頼するのは“驚き”と“心の痛み”。 そこにこそ人は惹きつけられる」と語り、自身の母親の死や家族の記憶など、個人的体験に根ざしたストーリーテリングが最も深く観客と接続する、とその背景を明かしました。 感情に響く表現こそが、物語の本質であり、ブランドにも通じる要素だと感じさせました。 単なる“わかりやすさ”や“映え”ではなく、繰り返し語られ、深く刺さるストーリーこそが、ブランドと生活者の関係に“複利”をもたらす。 その本質を、改めて感じさせられるセッションでした。 【2. 複数部門グランプリに見る“接点の越境”】 今年のCannes Lionsでは、単一チャネルや単発施策にとどまらず、社会・生活者・企業の“接点”を横断して作用するキャンペーンが高く評価されました。 1つのアイデアが複数の部門（＝視点）で受賞する傾向が見られたことは、今の時代におけるブランドの「振る舞い」の重要性を示しています。 特に注目を集めたのが、フランス発の保険グループAXAの『Three Words』キャンペーンです。 このキャンペーンは、Titanium Grand Prix、Direct、Creative Business Transformationの3部門でグランプリを受賞しました。 さらに、Film、Health & Wellness、Entertainmentなど複数部門でもGoldやBronzeを獲得し、その成果がAXA全体の高い評価に貢献。 AXAはCannes Lions2025において「Creative Brand of the Year」に選出されました。 『Three Words』キャンペーンの仕掛けはシンプルでありながら革新的。 住宅保険の契約文に“and domestic violence”を追加することで、家庭内暴力の被害者に対して避難・法的・心理的支援を保険の対象に含めたのです。 制度設計、サービス改善、社会的啓発の複数の接点を越境する設計が、多面的に評価された要因です。 また、Unilever傘下のDoveのキャンペーン『The Dove Code』（『Real Beauty Redefined for the AI Era』）は、Media部門でGrand Prixを獲得し、Glass部門でもショートリストに選出されました。 このキャンペーンでは、AIが生成するビジュアルが子どもたちの美意識に与える影響に着目し、教育用映像と「Real Beauty Prompt Playbook」を展開。 テクノロジー、教育、ジェンダーの接点をまたぐ設計によって、ブランドの社会的姿勢が高く評価されました。 さらに、Instagramの『Caption with Intention』は、Digital Craft、Design、Brand Experience & Activationの3部門でグランプリを受賞。 視覚障害のあるユーザーのためにaltテキスト記述の啓発活動、UI設計改善、クリエイター教育を並行展開し、テックとヒューマンセンタードデザインの交点に立つブランドの姿勢が評価されました。 これらの事例に共通していたのは、一発のバズや映えるビジュアルではなく、さまざまな接点を越境しながら連鎖的にブランド体験をつくっていること。 現代におけるブランド価値とは、単一チャネルのインパクトではなく、行動・サービス・社会的文脈が横断的につながる構造によって決まることを、今年のグランプリたちは示していました。 【3. “感情”が、体験設計の起点になる時代へ】 e.l.f.

353ffb64eee683bc3c4823c67a422e48,"  The Black Beauty market is exhibiting robust expansion driven by increasing consumer demand for inclusive and culturally resonant cosmetic and personal care products. Industry leaders are capitalizing on the growing preference for products tailored to diverse skin tones and hair textures, which is reshaping market dynamics significantly. Market Size and Overview The Global Black Beauty Market size is estimated to be valued at USD 8.96 billion in 2025 and is expected to reach USD 23.11 billion by 2032, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.5% from 2025 to 2032. Black Beauty Market Forecast indicates strong market opportunities fueled by rising awareness, product innovation, and expanded retail penetration. The market report highlights an escalating market revenue trajectory driven by the increasing demand for specialty skincare, cosmetics, and hair care products that address unique needs within the Black community. Impact of Geopolitical Situation on Supply Chain A notable real-world example is the US-China trade tariffs implemented in late 2024, which disrupted the supply of essential botanical extracts and synthetic ingredients vital to Black beauty formulations. This led to increased procurement costs for key players, compelling shifts toward nearshoring and strengthened supplier diversification in North America and Africa. Consequently, market growth strategies shifted to mitigate supply risks, ensuring steady market size expansion despite geopolitical turbulence. SWOT Analysis - Strengths: - Growing consumer demand for culturally attuned products is bolstering market revenue and industry size. - Enhanced R&D and personalization technologies increase market share and business growth potential. - Strong brand loyalty among core consumers fuels stable revenue streams. - Weaknesses: - Dependency on international raw materials exposes supply chains to geopolitical and economic uncertainties. - Regulatory compliance costs, especially in major markets like the EU, present ongoing market restraints. - Fragmented market segments in emerging regions limit rapid scalability. - Opportunities: - Rising e-commerce adoption in developing markets is expanding market scope and revenue streams. - Sustainability trends open markets for innovative natural and eco-friendly Black beauty products. - Strategic collaborations between market players and local manufacturers to optimize supply chains. - Threats: - Intensifying competition from niche and indie brands could dilute market share among established players. - Economic downturns and inflationary pressures might restrain consumer discretionary spending. - Political instability in key sourcing regions continues to threaten uninterrupted raw material flow. Key Players Key players driving the Black beauty market growth include L'Oréal S.A., Estée Lauder Companies Inc., Procter & Gamble Co., Unilever PLC, Revlon Inc., E.l.f.

Industry leaders are capitalizing on the growing preference for products tailored to diverse skin tones and hair textures, which is reshaping market dynamics significantly. Market Size and Overview The Global Black Beauty Market size is estimated to be valued at USD 8.96 billion in 2025 and is expected to reach USD 23.11 billion by 2032, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.5% from 2025 to 2032. Black Beauty Market Forecast indicates strong market opportunities fueled by rising awareness, product innovation, and expanded retail penetration. The market report highlights an escalating market revenue trajectory driven by the increasing demand for specialty skincare, cosmetics, and hair care products that address unique needs within the Black community. Impact of Geopolitical Situation on Supply Chain A notable real-world example is the US-China trade tariffs implemented in late 2024, which disrupted the supply of essential botanical extracts and synthetic ingredients vital to Black beauty formulations. This led to increased procurement costs for key players, compelling shifts toward nearshoring and strengthened supplier diversification in North America and Africa. Consequently, market growth strategies shifted to mitigate supply risks, ensuring steady market size expansion despite geopolitical turbulence. SWOT Analysis - Strengths: - Growing consumer demand for culturally attuned products is bolstering market revenue and industry size. - Enhanced R&D and personalization technologies increase market share and business growth potential. - Strong brand loyalty among core consumers fuels stable revenue streams. - Weaknesses: - Dependency on international raw materials exposes supply chains to geopolitical and economic uncertainties. - Regulatory compliance costs, especially in major markets like the EU, present ongoing market restraints. - Fragmented market segments in emerging regions limit rapid scalability. - Opportunities: - Rising e-commerce adoption in developing markets is expanding market scope and revenue streams. - Sustainability trends open markets for innovative natural and eco-friendly Black beauty products. - Strategic collaborations between market players and local manufacturers to optimize supply chains. - Threats: - Intensifying competition from niche and indie brands could dilute market share among established players. - Economic downturns and inflationary pressures might restrain consumer discretionary spending. - Political instability in key sourcing regions continues to threaten uninterrupted raw material flow.

5173a9a9a8de2f69f518598a9b580a5a,"  AARP Hearing Center Summer is not always smooth sailing … at least not beauty-wise. After 50, the challenges amp up as the weather and sun-and-fun lifestyle mess with our looks and confidence. Women say, “My makeup feels slimy and disappears in a pool of sweat” and “Help! I wear one-piece swimsuits but need some extra grooming,” or “I love breezy midi skirts, but how do I stop the chafing between my thighs?” So relatable! As a beauty and fashion editor, stylist and personal shopper for women over 50, I hear complaints like these daily. Here's how to avoid and solve some of the most talked-about disasters. 1. Melty, greasy, cakey makeup Some women insist that matte formulas and powder are the way to go when it comes to summer makeup. Big mistake! Combine that strategy with heat, sweat and a hot flash or two, and all you'll have is a cakey, dull mask on your face. Other women blithely ignore the weather and continue to layer serums, moisturizer, sunscreen and makeup like it's dry, icy February, not steamy July. Of course, this bunch ends up with a runny, soggy mess that's gooey, not glowy. Looking fresh-faced during a heat wave depends on your willingness to pare down your makeup routine in favor of multitasking products that prevent buildup and reduce slide. To keep skin plumped, protected and polished during the day, all you need is one thing: a tinted moisturizer with built-in sun protection, like Merit Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen SPF 45 ($38, kohls.com) or Tower 28 Beauty SunnyDays SPF30 Tinted Sunscreen Foundation ($32, sephora.com); or, for extra coverage, a CC cream like IT Cosmetics Your Skin But Better CC+ Nude Glow SPF 40 ($47, target.com). The effect is subtly radiant and not greasy, sticky or shiny. If your skin feels wet or clammy as the day goes on, dampen a makeup sponge with cool water, squeeze out the excess and press it on spots where you have perspiration breakthrough. Then reapply the tinted moisturizer. If you're a heavy sweater, try a waterproof, sweatproof setting mist like Milani Make It Last Original- Natural Finish Setting Spray ($13, walgreens.com) or e.l.f. Stay All Night Micro-Fine Setting Mist ($10, cvs.com) — not powder. Simply spray it onto a makeup sponge and gently press it onto oil-prone areas like the sides of the nose and forehead, and in deep expression lines like those that extend from the nose to the mouth. 2. Bust, thigh and body chafing Can't stand the term “chub rub”? Me neither. However, it does describe the situation when one sweaty inner thigh meets its mate. This kind of irritation is not limited to the thighs. It also happens to bare, damp skin under sweaty bra bands and straps, sandal straps, waistbands on skirts and pants, even under the neckline border and leg-line openings of some swimsuits. One supereffective solution to chafing is wearing a light and stretchy control panty, like Red Hot by Spanx Women's Light Control Shapewear Primers Midthigh 10162R in Champagne Nude or Black ($26, kohls.com), under skirts and dresses, even breezy midis and maxis. Choose those with a cotton gusset that can be worn in place of underwear, long enough to cover the sensitive area. Anti-chafe sticks, a current and growing beauty trend, are another way to go. Designed like stick deodorant, they have a silky, almost powderlike finish that glides over the skin and creates a stay-put barrier to friction while soothing irritation with ingredients like aloe, coconut oil, grapeseed oil and shea butter. Some, like Megababe Thigh Rescue Anti-Friction Stick ($14, target.com), are designed for a specific spot. Others, like Dove Anti-Chafe Whole Body Deo in Raspberry & Rose ($13, cvs.com), which is gynecologist- and dermatologist-approved, and First Aid Beauty Anti-Chafe Stick ($20, nordstrom.com), work head to toe. 3. Frizzy, out-of-control hair Summer is frizz season. Just ask women who struggle to keep their smooth, sleek blowouts and polished curls from going haywire. Sure, genes are partly to blame, but sizzling, humid temperatures also cause styled hair to revert to its prestyled texture. Here's why: Once hair escapes the cool indoor environment of air-conditioning, it absorbs moisture from the air, and the hair shaft swells and produces a fluffy, unruly look. Your best fast fix is a chic hair band, claw clip or scrunchie, so throw these in your bag on humid days. Many women ask me about salon keratin treatments. They do delete frizz for the summer, but the intense chemicals, including formaldehyde, and reactions, including headache, stinging eyes, throat issues, and rashes, are a turnoff. So is the $350 to $800 cost and the possible harm to weak, fragile, thin or damaged hair. My advice? Try one of the new frizz banishers that activate with the heat from a blow-dryer. Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray for Frizzy Hair ($12, kohls.com), Tresemmé Keratin Smooth Blowout Heat Protectant Spray ($9, target.com) and John Frieda Frizz Ease Smooth Operator Blowout Spray ($12, cvs.com) keep hair smooth through three or more shampoos. Unlike frizz serums and creams, there's no heavy residue to weigh hair down, and results last for a steamy, sticky week or two. It's worth the extra time and effort to do the initial precise, section-by-section blow-dry with a round brush.","AARP Hearing Center Summer is not always smooth sailing … at least not beauty-wise.

He is survived by his wife and three children. Earlier this year, Rose revealed that he was undergoing treatment for Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL). This came after a fight against cancer that began in November 2023, when he was diagnosed with tonsil cancer. Following months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, he was initially told this had gone.

This is the result of an update to its fair use policy. Somewhat unsurprisingly, disgruntled customers have taken to social media to vent spleen. For instance, Rhea Sangha, Senior Marketing Manager at John Lewis Partnership, said in a LinkedIn post: ""This morning I received an email from Asos to inform me they were closing my account. I was pretty gobsmacked as I am die hard, loyal fan and have been a regular customer for years. It's my go to for holidays, weddings, parties and I bloody love Topshop!!"" ""Yes, I'm a big shopper so yes as a result I probably do send a fair amount of returns (which I pay for!) but isn't that the nature of online shopping?

Clothes unfortunately do not fit me like a glove…"" She added: “I spend hundreds of pounds year with Asos, in the last month alone I've purchased 12 items and spent £350+.

UK () July 3, 2025 Asos comes under fire as disgruntled customers' accounts are closed due to their online returns activity Online fast fashion giant Asos has recently been deleting customers' accounts due to high levels of return activity. This is the result of an update to its fair use policy. Somewhat unsurprisingly, disgruntled customers have taken to social media to vent spleen. For instance, Rhea Sangha, Senior Marketing Manager at John Lewis Partnership, said in a LinkedIn post: ""This morning I received an email from Asos to inform me they were closing my account. I was pretty gobsmacked as I am die hard, loyal fan and have been a regular customer for years. It's my go to for holidays, weddings, parties and I bloody love Topshop!!"" ""Yes, I'm a big shopper so yes as a result I probably do send a fair amount of returns (which I pay for!) but isn't that the nature of online shopping? Isn't that what happens when you can't feel the material/see the quality/check the sizing/try on the clothes to see how a style suits your figure. And as a curvy girl - NOT easy! Clothes unfortunately do not fit me like a glove…"" She added: “I spend hundreds of pounds year with Asos, in the last month alone I've purchased 12 items and spent £350+. I know quite a few other friends this has happened to who have complained for several months to Asos with no real clarity or solution. Is this really how retailers should be treating their best customers? Is this what loyalty should feel like?"" ""Very disappointing. Working in fashion retail myself I know how important it is to protect and reward your most frequent, loyal shoppers so I'm pretty disappointed (hence the post!) Please engage with my post if you agree and let me know what you think?""

'It took her three years,' the actor told Adam Carolla during a recent episode of The Adam Carolla Show. 'What, did you think that was just some rotten tomatoes journey? The cool part of it is she's super smart, smart in business,' he continued of the 28-year-old. His kind words came in the wake of a family rift after he publicly urged fans to pray for her and her husband Justin Bieber, which she considered to be him meddling in their affairs, a source told DailyMail.com. 'Succeeded as a model prior to everything she's doing now. But the cool part was she actually had an offer to do something pretty big and cool in the cosmetics a couple years ago and didn't.' Stephen, 58, went on to explain that Hailey didn't just endorse a brand someone else came up with, she made products that she would use herself. 'The reason its succeeding is people are responding to it,' he noted. ' It actually works as hydration and all of that.' Stephen is also dad to 32-year-old daughter Alaia Baldwin Aronow and he revealed he takes a hands-off approach to his kids' careers. 'I let my kids do what they're doing,' he shared. ' And if they want to throw a boomerang at me, I'll call them back.' Plus, both of his girls are married to successful men and he gushed over Justin Bieber and Alaia's husband Andrew Aronow. As Stephen added, 'I'm blessed that my two daughters married two great guys.' He also insisted that family comes first. 'The sweet part of my kids, too, is, in the wake of whatever their success is, their dad remains the same,' he gushed. 'I've always been the same way. You know you're going to tell your daughter the truth.' And he's crediting Hailey with helping Justin through the hard time he's having lately. The Usual Suspects actor said: 'I am just glad he connected with a great gal to help him survive.' Stephen added: 'Their happiness and their wellbeing and their health is more obviously now better than ever.' In August 2024, Hailey and Justin welcomed their first child, son Jack Blues, and his grandad Stephen gushed with pride about the newborn describing him as 'incredibly cute'. Asked about the new parents, who got married in 2018 after a whirlwind romance, Stephen said that new parenthood has been 'very relaxed' for the couple. He added: 'They're just spending really sweet, private quality time with Jack and we're just getting ready to watch him come out on the world here, come out on the scene.' He also offered his babysitting services: 'Sometimes grandpa can clean up. You know what I'm saying?' Hailey is allegedly choosing to keep her parents away from her baby son Jack amid her ongoing tensions with the pair, according to sources who say she has long clashed with Stephen and Kennya Baldwin over religious and political beliefs. Though her father celebrated the birth of his grandson with a post on Instagram, which Hailey did not like from her own account, the model's mother raised eyebrows after choosing not to mark the moment on her own social media feed. It highlights Hailey's strained relationship with her parents, which reportedly started to 'break down' further when the beauty mogul fell pregnant. 'Hailey's relationship with her family has been eroding for some time now,' a source told DailyMail.com exclusively. 'She was closer with her mom, but that started to break down when she fell pregnant because she didn't want to tell her family for months.' The insider explained that the situation that ultimately pushed Hailey over the edge was when her father shared a post asking fans to pray for Hailey and Justin, something which sparked concern for the couple.","Have YOU got a story?

' And if they want to throw a boomerang at me, I'll call them back.' Plus, both of his girls are married to successful men and he gushed over Justin Bieber and Alaia's husband Andrew Aronow. As Stephen added, 'I'm blessed that my two daughters married two great guys.' He also insisted that family comes first. 'The sweet part of my kids, too, is, in the wake of whatever their success is, their dad remains the same,' he gushed. 'I've always been the same way. You know you're going to tell your daughter the truth.' And he's crediting Hailey with helping Justin through the hard time he's having lately. The Usual Suspects actor said: 'I am just glad he connected with a great gal to help him survive.' Stephen added: 'Their happiness and their wellbeing and their health is more obviously now better than ever.' In August 2024, Hailey and Justin welcomed their first child, son Jack Blues, and his grandad Stephen gushed with pride about the newborn describing him as 'incredibly cute'. Asked about the new parents, who got married in 2018 after a whirlwind romance, Stephen said that new parenthood has been 'very relaxed' for the couple. He added: 'They're just spending really sweet, private quality time with Jack and we're just getting ready to watch him come out on the world here, come out on the scene.' He also offered his babysitting services: 'Sometimes grandpa can clean up. You know what I'm saying?' Hailey is allegedly choosing to keep her parents away from her baby son Jack amid her ongoing tensions with the pair, according to sources who say she has long clashed with Stephen and Kennya Baldwin over religious and political beliefs. Though her father celebrated the birth of his grandson with a post on Instagram, which Hailey did not like from her own account, the model's mother raised eyebrows after choosing not to mark the moment on her own social media feed. It highlights Hailey's strained relationship with her parents, which reportedly started to 'break down' further when the beauty mogul fell pregnant. 'Hailey's relationship with her family has been eroding for some time now,' a source told DailyMail.com exclusively. 'She was closer with her mom, but that started to break down when she fell pregnant because she didn't want to tell her family for months.' The insider explained that the situation that ultimately pushed Hailey over the edge was when her father shared a post asking fans to pray for Hailey and Justin, something which sparked concern for the couple.",2025-07-05 16:50:22,en,WEB,,dailymail,,,1,False,False,"The content is primarily about Hailey Bieber, Stephen Baldwin, and her Rhode skincare brand being sold to e.l.f.

Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder, which is SO GOOD at eliminating shine and blurring pores that I feel like it'd smirk at you and go, ""How 'bout that, huh? "" if it had a human form. If you dread summer because you love wearing makeup but the heat and humidity leave it looking patchy, this'll lock it in with a smooth, semi-matte finish. Your oily T-zone doesn't know what's coming for it. One reviewer compares this to a $59 Givenchy powder! Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""This is the secret for makeup in hot and humid climates! I am a sweaty person, but I also love wearing makeup regardless of the weather. While holidaying in Southeast Asia at the start of wet season, I faced temperatures between 35 and 40 degrees Celsius (95–104 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity. After finishing my base makeup, I applied this powder all over. I did not use a setting spray because most break me out. Luckily, no setting spray was necessary while using this setting powder! It kept my foundation and cream blush from separating or becoming patchy, and also kept me from being too shiny. I reapplied a couple of times per day. This is magical and I will definitely be using regularly during the summers in North America too!"" —Sara Lima Get it from Amazon for $25. 2. A smocked midi dress because Hill House's Nap Dress is truly ~dreamy~ but your bank account is like, ""Um, we still need to buy groceries."" This cutie's a fraction of the cost and just as gorgeous, not to mention breathable as heck thanks to its 100% organic cotton poplin fabric. Prepare to fall head over heels for this dress — I definitely did. I recently wore this dress (in shade Lipstick Pink) to an outdoor wedding and I. AM. OBSESSED. It hugs my frame beautifully with the stretchy smocked waist — I can even get away with not wearing a bra, though for context I'm a B cup — and the flowy bottom of the dress sits just right. I personally haven't tried Hill House's Nap Dress (I drool over the designs, but $178 is a little too steep for me), but I'm perfectly happy to stock up on this dress in a few colors for around the same price. My colleague Heather Braga, on the other hand, is a Hill House devotee — but even she was impressed by this cheaper option: ""Listen, I am the proud owner of NINE Hill House Nap Dresses. I condone splurging on them (truly, by all means) and will be the first to tell you they are worth every penny. That being said, I tried out one of these from Quince and LOVE it. I have the Tribeca Stripe pattern and cannot believe how similar it feels to the other brand. It's my current go-to style for my frame (two kids in two years, send prayers) and is one of the few things I know I can throw on and KNOW I look great. Will definitely add another to an upcoming order and have been shouting from the rooftops how wonderful this brand fits."" Get it from Quince for $69.90 (available in sizes XS–XL and nine styles). 3. E.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen if you're still trying to find a daily sunscreen you don't despise. This clear gel sunscreen offers SPF 35 and goes on so smooth and lightweight, you'll immediately forget you're wearing it — no white cast here, folks. It doubles as a blurring primer, so it's great for wearing under makeup too! If you love Supergoop but the price is becoming hard to swallow...may I suggest trying this, because it's *very* similar. The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop's cult-fave product end. I've tried both, and I honestly prefer this E.l.f. version. Supergoop's had a slight graininess to it that I didn't love, while this E.l.f. sunscreen is exactly what I'd hoped Supergoop's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top!...","This blurring powder is basically pure witchcraft and your *best* weapon against heat and humidity.

Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day, and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews, and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice, but both times I was outside and untouched. Delivery was very quick, so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hyper sensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive."" —Tracey Agopian Get a ten-pack from Amazon for $9.98. 4. And if it's entirely too late for that, a delightful little tool called the ""Bug Bite Thing"" — it suctions on all kinds of bug bites to reduce swelling, itchiness, and redness, so you don't spend half your trip itching your appendages. Bug Bite Thing is a family-owned small business established in 2017 that specializes in bug bite relief products. This works on mosquitoes, bees, wasps, biting flies, sea lice, and more (although TBH, if this list of bugs gets any longer I may just stay indoors forever!!) . Promising review: ""I cannot stress to you enough how much better this simple little tool has made my quality of life during summer in Ohio. It rains a lot. There are a lot of mosquitoes. I have horrific allergic reactions to mosquito bites. We're talking bumps swelling to the width of softballs within minutes of the bite. This tool doesn't make those bumps go away, but it stops the itch IMMEDIATELY. I was a huge skeptic; how could a little suction cure this agonizingly itchy allergic reaction? I'll be honest. I still really don't know how it does, but it provides instant relief that no pill, cream, or injection ever has ever achieved for me. If you live anywhere where insect bites are common, you need to own one of these.""...","This nifty sand eraser and TikTok-famous bug bite healing stick might be teensy in size, but they are ginormously handy. 1.

Let me just keep doing the stuff I've been doing.'” Now he's a king unleashed, and Bat City better get ready for the new Alexander. “My drag has already gone on such a journey of gender expansiveness and helping people understand that masculinity can be soft, flamboyant, effeminate, whatever, and still be masculine,” he explains, adding he has his new drag brothers to thank for his growth. “Seeing my cast mates, like my mind was just blown open… every single person just expanded the possibilities for me for drag. I feel like I learned something from every single person.” As always, some of the most moving and eye-opening moments on the show itself were in the interactions between the kings. This week saw the E.L.F. Cosmetics weenie challenge take a surprisingly emotional turn. It highlighted the ways in which makeup can be particularly fraught for kings. “Everyone on the cast definitely has a different relationship [with makeup], and mine has certainly evolved with time,” says Alexander. “In the early days...I would do my little eyeliner beard and fill in my brows. But I didn't want to play too much more with that, because I was trying to emulate masculinity.” Jesse Grant/ for Revry Alexander the Great attends the ""King of Drag"" S1 Premiere hosted by LGBTQ+ Streaming Network Revry at Beaches Tropicana on June 22, 2025 in West Hollywood, California. But that changed for the king during the pandemic, when, like so many who found themselves isolated at home, he found themselves on a journey of self-discovery. “I was able to just be at home and play with a lot of different versions of my mug and elevate. I experienced this kind of, like leveling up, this expansion, where I was like, wait a minute, even when I was...socialized as a female growing up, I never used makeup inway. I never used makeup to this extreme. I never contoured, I never highlighted. So once I realized that I would never have used makeup in this way, it became empowering again.” It was another moment that really illuminated the close bonds the cast formed, both on and off set, that allow for the kinds of raw and real conversations we see in the Man Cave. Off set, the vibes are a bit sillier, whether that was late night bonding seshes's with his hotel roommate Dick Von Dyke, who Alexander joked really impressed him with his ability to fall asleep mid conversation. “We would be talking, and then [he] would kind of go silent, and I would look over, and he'd be passed out, unconscious. And that was like, well, was enjoying our conversation,” laughs Alexander. But it was the Tuna Can Van, that really brought the eliminated kings (EKs as they called themselves) together. What is the Tuna Can Van? Well, it's the van that rented to cheer each of his fellow eliminated kings up after they left the competition. “Tuna is literally a saint,” Alexander gushes. “Let me tell you, I prepared my package backwards. I thought I was going to the finale. I spent a long time working on my stuff for the finale. So, when I got eliminated, I was like ! But Tuna was waiting for us back at the hotel, with snacks and goodies. And the next day took us to, like, Santa Monica.

He went against the grain aesthetically for a horror challenge, with a brightly colored cape and bodysuit, but every detail was intentional. “That costume was all recycled materials, fabric, a bodysuit I already had, and everything else was, yeah, a labor of love,” says Alexander.

Around the same time Michael Jordan, a basketball star, teamed up with Nike, a sports brand, to launch the Air Jordan line of trainers. More recently, however, a growing number of celebrities have opted to build consumer enterprises of their own.

Hailey Bieber launches skincare lipbalm for her brand Rhode Credit: Hailey Bieber/Instagram Since then the trend has continued apace, with stars from Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (men's skincare) and Emma Watson (gin) to Sir David Beckham (supplements) and Wiz Khalifa (mushroom-growing kits) all taking part. In May Hailey Bieber, wife of Justin Bieber, a pop star, sold her make-up brand Rhode to e.l.f. Beauty, a cosmetics firm, for as much as $1b. As the boundary between retail and social media blurs, celebrities are reshaping the world of consumer goods. The proliferation of celebrity brands is partly a reflection of changes in the media industry. In decades past, the business of communicating with consumers was largely intermediated by a handful of television channels, radio stations and print publications. No more. These days, says Douglas Holt, a marketing guru, every social-media account is a channel of its own. That has allowed celebrities to engage directly with their fans. Ms Kardashian has over 350m followers on Instagram. She frequently wears and talks about Skims online. “Kim is a phenomenal creative director,” says Jens Grede, her co-founder, “but she's also a one-woman media powerhouse.” According to Launchmetrics, an analytics firm, Skims last year generated more than $US600m in “media impact value”, a gauge of the monetary benefit of online posts, press coverage and other media exposure. That was eight times as much as for Spanx, a rival shapewear brand. Not only are celebrities now able to communicate directly with their fans. They can sell directly to them, too. Fledgling brands no longer need to sell via big retailers, who take a cut of profits, or to open physical stores, which involves enormous upfront investment. To sell online, they do not even need to go through e-commerce platforms like Amazon. Tools such as those offered by Shopify, a Canadian software firm, have made it easier than ever to build an e-commerce site or mobile app. Social-media platforms such as TikTok now allow brands to sell directly to users, too. Direct-to-consumer sales have risen to account for around one-seventh of e-commerce globally, according to NIQ, a data provider. Anita Balchandani of McKinsey, a consultancy, reckons they make up as much as 100 per cent of revenue in the early days of a typical celebrity brand, dropping to 30-60 per cent as firms expand and add third-party distribution. Of course, not every celebrity brand takes off. The Honest Company, a maker of baby and beauty products co-founded by Jessica Alba, an actress, has lost three-quarters of its market value since listing its shares in 2021. Alex Griffin, marketing chief for On, a sportswear brand worn by tennis player Roger Federer and actress Zendaya, says there is a reason many stars still opt for endorsements instead of starting their own brands: “It's not that easy.” Picking the right type of product matters. Clothes and booze are things people often buy for what they symbolise, rather than their functionality, says Sandra Cariglio of ReD Associates, an advisory firm. That makes them safer bets for celebrities. Attractive stars may naturally find it easy to sell beauty products, too. It helps that the production of cosmetics is easy to outsource to white-label manufacturers, as it is for fragrances. Jill Avery of Harvard Business School adds that products need to “fit” the celebrity's own brand. Fans buy make-up from Ms Bieber because she has long shared beauty tips online, and shapewear from Ms Kardashian because she is known for her curves. Asked why he is launching a running app, Mo Farah, an athlete with four Olympic gold medals to his name, says simply: “That's all I know.”...","The EconomistTHE ECONOMIST: As the boundary between retail and social media blurs, celebrities are reshaping the world of consumer goods.

mov_BF199872F59711547F7A8220AB90AD98,"  Shop her favorites from $28 now Scarlett Johansson is in her Prime — literally. Between filming fun movies like Jurassic World Rebirth and making history on the set of Saturday Night Live, she's juggling behind the scenes work on The Outset, her very own skincare line, and, spoiler, doing some Amazon shopping along the way. “I'm definitely a Prime member,” Johansson tells PEOPLE. “It's my go-to for everything from batteries to kids' snacks to random home essentials.” Ahead of Amazon Prime Day, we caught up with the actress to get details on all of the best The Outset products, as well as learn a little more about the things she buys when no one's watching. The Outset Deals to Shop During Amazon Prime Day The Outset Firming Vegan Collagen Prep Serum Amazon “I always say if I were stranded on a desert island, I'd need our Firming Prep Serum with me. It's really the backbone of my routine,” she tells PEOPLE. “[It's] super lightweight, absorbs instantly, and makes my skin feel balanced and hydrated. I use it morning and night without fail.” The under-$50 product contains Hyaluroset, the brand's better-than-hyaluronic acid hydrating ingredient and, contrary to its name, does more than just firm the skin. The fragrance-free product will also save you money on additional brightening and plumping products, since it does that, too. The Outset Botanical Barrier Rescue Balm Amazon The actress is not, in fact, on a stranded island, so she can have all the products with her whenever, wherever. The Botanical Barrier Rescue Balm is the one she never leaves home without. “It does everything — I use it to tame flyaways, moisturize cuticles, hydrate my lips… it's a true multitasker, and I reapply it multiple times a day,” she tells PEOPLE. The Outset Gentle Micellar Antioxidant Cleanser Amazon So you don't have time to do a skincare routine? “I get it,” says Johansson. “I have two kids, a production schedule, and a skincare line to run, so time is precious.” But those who relate should try the brand's Daily Essentials 3-Step Regimen. It includes this cleanser and her stranded-on-an-island-serum above. Plus, it's fast! “I've timed it,” she adds. “It takes me about 2 minutes and 36 seconds on the dot.” The Outset Squalane Daily Moisturizer Amazon The Squalane Daily Moisturizer is the third and final step of the beginner-friendly routine, which her friends and family are all fond of, and one that “really sets up your skin for success,” she adds. The Outset Lip Oasis Glossy Treatment Amazon The Lip Oasis Glossy Treatment is another popular pick among her loved ones and shoppers alike. The shiny lip treatment has sold out at least five times and racked up a 1,000+ person waitlist. It's said to give you “glass lips,” per the brand — which I can confirm. I was sent the product to try, and my lips quickly got the Cinderella-like effect. E.l.f. Cosmetics Wow Brow Gel Amazon As for her beauty buys outside of The Outset, the actress is a fan of brow gel since “it's such a quick way to feel polished, even with no makeup on.” She also calls blotting papers and setting spray “lifesavers for long days or events.” We didn't get the intel on which brands she uses, but thankfully, Amazon has so many to choose from. Apple AirPods Max Wireless Over-Ear Headphones Amazon It doesn't stop there: “I've found so many great organizing tools for the house on Amazon — everything from drawer dividers to silicone snack bags. I also swear by portable chargers and noise-canceling headphones for travel days. Anything that helps streamline the chaos is a win.” Another win?...","Shop her favorites from $28 now Scarlett Johansson is in her Prime — literally.

The shiny lip treatment has sold out at least five times and racked up a 1,000+ person waitlist. It's said to give you “glass lips,” per the brand — which I can confirm. I was sent the product to try, and my lips quickly got the Cinderella-like effect. E.l.f.

1ludsxs,"  I turn red in the face and I'm struggling to cover it up properly and effectively. So, for some context as to how this began: I started a medication last Christmas and with every medication comes their side effects as most would know. I didn't know that my medication would stop me from sweating as it was always cold in the house because it was winter, but once it started getting warmer, my face would turn red often even from the littlest bit of warmth. And I know some might say that's normal and unavoidable, but I've never had it happen as often and as severe as this. In previous years, including last year, my cheeks were the only part on my face that would frequently turn red from warmth. Nowadays, my medication causes my face to turn red when I'm even just a little bit too warm. The only way to help battle the redness without makeup (and also because I'm literally too overheated to function) is to cool myself down with air conditioning because nothing else helps. The reason I'm making this post is because I have been struggling with makeup lately to help cover up my redness (oftentimes before it happens), especially when I'm leaving the house. I've never turned this red before, and even if I did, it was usually only on my cheeks, not my entire face like it is nowadays thanks to the medication… I have dry and sensitive skin, and not a lot of products have worked for me, but for a couple months now, I have been using Jason Wu's Tinted Moisturizer Meets CC Cream and it's been the best base makeup product I've used in years! I've also switched from putting the green shade from the NYX Color Corrector palette all over my face (exhausting because it takes forever to work into the skin) to recently using Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Color Correcting Concealer (because I use their normal Age Rewind Concealer and I've loved it since forever). I have also purchased the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer since someone I know recommended it for my situation, but I haven't tried it yet since I don't understand how it helps… And no, this post isn't just me rambling about my struggles with makeup. I'm here asking for help from those who may have experience with these products, this situation, or those who have professional makeup advice for me. There's a few issues I've been having with my makeup lately: 1. I've found that sometimes touching my face will take my tinted moisturizer right off, or if my nail presses ever so slightly onto my skin, that it'll remove the makeup in that exact area. I've tried to combat this by setting my face with the only setting powder I own, which is one from E.L.F. I just don't remember the name. I've only done this method once and it seemed to have helped but I'm unsure about how much it helped. 2. If I don't apply enough of my chosen colour corrector (remember, I still haven't tried the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer yet) underneath my tinted moisturizer, then my redness will shine through later on and it makes me feel horrible about myself (I know many people have rosacea and other skin conditions that can cause mass redness, but I'm just remaining honest on how my type of redness makes me feel, so please don't take any offence as I don't mean any…). 3. To conclude this, I'm also heavily struggling with how to make this whole process simpler and less stress-inducing because I'm oftentimes trying to cover my redness before it actually appears, so I cannot tell how much green will help combat the red. Sometimes I've used too little and later my redness peeked through my makeup, or I've used too much and I've had to put on a lot of tinted moisturizer to cover it. It was also my first time using setting powder because I was scared it would cause me to dry out because of my skin type. I just need some advice… If anyone has any questions regarding what I mentioned, then please ask. I'd like to get some feedback and suggestions from anyone who is familiar with this or knows, professionally, how to help. I'm also on a tight budget as I barely make any money nowadays, so purchasing luxury beauty products or pricy items is something I'd very much like to avoid unless there's no other way. Sorry for this jumble of stuff. I've just been so frustrated lately and I've gotten very tired of spending a lot of time looking up how to help with these things and coming up with nothing, either because the advice found didn't help or wasn't the right solution to my problem. Thank you. ***TL;DR: I've been turning red in the face from a medication I take that stops me from sweating (meaning I cannot cool myself down). I'm struggling to both cover this up and maintain my makeup without it smudging off or rubbing off by a small tap to the face.

mov_79A661DC8BA2EC26E49A2ABA92F9599E,"  Higher prices for a lot of popular products seem inevitable on our current trajectory. James Martin/CNET In many cases and for many products in the US, the biggest impacts of President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff plans haven't hit yet — but that could be about to change as the 90-day pause on the “reciprocal” tariffs is set to end this week. However things shake out, numerous companies have already hiked prices or said that they'll increase in the near-future — including, most recently, a popular and CNET-approved brand of smart lights. The fact of the matter is that tariffs — a tax placed on the importing of certain products into a country — will ultimately cause prices to go up, with Walmart characterizing these eventual price hikes as “inevitable” during its earnings call last month. Given Trump's push to place historically high tariffs on goods from almost every country in the world, you can also expect these price hikes to hit a huge variety of products. This truth has begun to sink in for a lot of Americans. About 64% of American adults are making tech purchases soon to avoid potential price hikes, according to CNET's most recent tariff sentiment survey. Around 51% of Americans adults also said that they already bought or plan to buy a personal tech device — such as a smartphone, laptop or tablet — soon. To help you keep score, I've put together a list of all the companies that have either confirmed or warned of price hikes due to Trump's tariffs. As other companies make such announcements, you can expect new names to be added here. Continue on for all those details, and for more, find out why it's best if you wait on buying a new iPhone. One item you won't find on this list yet? The original Nintendo Switch, which will see a currently unspecified price hike on Aug. 1, but only in Canada for the time being. If that increase makes its way south of the border, we'll let you know. Best Buy Without getting into specifics, Best Buy CEO Corie Barry told the Wall Street Journal late last month that it has already raised prices on certain products as part of its response to the tariffs. e.l.f. Known as an affordable option in the beauty world, e.l.f. announced in late May that it would be implementing a $1 price hike across its product line in response to the tariffs. CEO Tarang Amin claimed that the reaction from customers was positive, on account of the company's transparency. “We're not trying to pull anything over on anyone,” Amin told Fortune. “This is exactly what we're facing, and they understand.” Macy's Speaking to CNBC in late May, Macy's CEO Tony Spring said that price hikes will be implemented on some products due to tariffs, while also emphasizing that other tactics — like discontinuing certain products altogether — will also be a response to rising costs. Mattel Known for brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels, Mattel sounded the alarm over likely price increases during an early May earnings call. While it's unclear how much the toymaker's prices have increased since then, the company told investors that it would be, “where necessary, taking pricing action in its US business,” or to put it plainly, raising prices for consumers to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Nikon Camera-maker Nikon will introduce price hikes in response to Trump's tariffs, effective June 23. This move will only target lenses and accessories the company makes and sells, so the cameras themselves are safe for now. “We will be carefully monitoring any tariff developments and may adjust pricing as necessary to reflect the evolving market conditions,” a statement from Nikon explained. “We wish to thank our customers for their understanding and know that we are taking every possible step to minimize the impact on our community.” Philips Hue Parent company Signify announced that prices for its popular and highly regarded Philips Hue brand of smart lights will see price hikes effective July 1. The company also confirmed that this decision was made “as a direct result of tariffs.” “Signify reserves the right to modify prices based on new or additional tariffs becoming effective in the future,” the company's official statement explained. Ralph Lauren Sales at the luxury goods retailer Ralph Lauren have apparently remained steady amid recent uncertainty, but the company is still forging ahead with a plan to combat tariff impacts by raising prices more than it had already intended to, according to the Wall Street Journal. Shein and Temu Trump's tariffs have made a notable target of China, hitting the country with a 30% rate only after initially hiking it all the way to 145%. Online retailers like Shein and Temu rely on direct shipments from markets like China in order to offer the rock-bottom prices that made them famous, so it's little surprise now that they've had to raise prices. The Trump administration has furthered the issues faced by these companies by doing away with a rule known as the “de minimus” exception, which used to exclude smaller purchases under $800 from import taxes. With that rule gone, Trump's China tariffs will now apply to both bulk orders of industrial building materials and those shoes you've been looking to buy from Shein. Subaru Subaru has hiked prices across almost its entire line. The increase ranged from $750 to $2,055, depending on the model, with only the EV Solterra avoiding any change. As has become a trend with some companies, Subaru avoided attributing the price hikes to Trump's tariffs, citing only the common refrain of “market conditions.” Trump has notably disparaged companies that explicitly lay the blame for price hikes on his policies. “The changes were made to offset increased costs while maintaining a solid value proposition for the customer. Subaru pricing is not based on the country of origin of its products,” a Subaru spokesperson said in a statement to Car & Driver....","Higher prices for a lot of popular products seem inevitable on our current trajectory.

mov_2772BA8226CF395470239914A63E9D8D,"  Last week's episode of saw Pressure K leaving alongside Alexander the Great in a heartbreaking double elimination. While every episode thus far in this inaugural season of the groundbreaking series has delivered on both laughs and heartfelt moments (truly, this show is of drag), this week's hit even harder. This time, the challenge was all about tapping into and embodying the competitors' deepest fears, and what that meant for many of the kings was unpacking their trauma and opening up some of their most vulnerable sides to the world. Leading the charge in that regard was . The comic and pride of the Atlanta king community opened up in ways that neither the kings, the audience, the judges, but most of all ever expected (Pressure K uses he/him pronouns in drag, and she/her off stage). It began with the weenie challenge, in which the kings were tasked with creating a dual makeup look, one side of their face being beautiful and the other monstrous, using e.l.f. Cosmetics. It proved to be an emotional challenge for Pressure K, who revealed a traumatic experience and relationship with makeup. “I came home to makeup,” he shared with his fellow kings. A loaded statement that only becomes more harrowing when you hear the story behind it. Courtesy of Pressure K “My mother felt like she needed to teach me how to be a woman,” Pressure recalls to PRIDE. “So I was, like, legit taking classes. ' This is what a woman does.' Or like, if I do something, 'what you did is wrong, this is what you're supposed to do.' [It] got to a point where I felt like feminine activities became a punishment.” As a result of some perceived deviation from prescribed womanhood, one day in her teens, Pressure came home one day to find someone waiting for her. “I'm not exactly sure what I did. I might have, like, wore a hat, or they might have caught me in baggy clothes. I might have made an aggressive move, and I came home to the Mary Kay party,” she recalls. While Pressure put on a happy face, one she says her mother had trained her to adopt growing up, “I knew how to like...” Pressure says while demonstrating a happy expression. “People think I'm built for the camera. Really it's my trauma of my mother turning me on, and turning me off.” As the makeup demonstration went on, Pressure became increasingly convinced it was evidence that she was unacceptable and unlovable. “They made me feel like I needed to cover up, like what I had was wrong, like my complexion was wrong,” she recalls. “The more makeup I put on, the more I didn't look like myself. And I took it as my mother thinks I'm ugly, like I have to cover this up.” From then on, Pressure's relationship with makeup was fraught, to say the least. That was until a chance encounter with one of her castmates, Perka $exx, changed everything for her — by watching the drag king perform in a full face of makeup and expressing a kind of freedom that Pressure craved. Matt Shaw “Back in the day, we had drag kings, but we didn't call it drag. We just, like, sing a song so you can get the girl at the club, like it wasn't a thing,” says Pressure. But then Perka took to the stage. “The way Perka moved and the art [of] his makeup... it wasn't that he was trying to be like, 'I'm ugly, I need to cover up.' It was like he was pushing the art out,” explains Pressure. “I was like, that's it. I don't know exactly what it is, but I need to know what that is, because it was just an aura of freedom that was coming off of him.” It would be a while before Pressure fully realized that “aura of freedom” for herself, but it happened one night when heartbreak over splitting from her mentor led her to perform her rawest number yet. “I was just so heartbroken. And I was listening to gospel at the time, and it was just like every time I heard it, I would just cry, like every time I just it,” so at an event called Mug Check, Pressure brought that energy to the stage. “[I put on] the most regular outfit: black button down, black pants with a robe, like the choir robe,” she recounts. “Everything started at the stairs and came down and had a whole choir behind me, and I just remember, like I looked up... and I felt that freedom that Perka had.” “It felt bigger than me. Felt bigger than the pain. It was my freedom,” she says. “It was the first time I felt like I was able to breathe since me and my wife got married.” When asked if drag is how they bypass some of the trauma when those old patterns of emotional repression arise, Pressure K is adamant, “Yes, it's the cheat code,” she says. Pressure had a similar revelation this week during the horror challenge that saw the king donning a robe again, this time with words emblazoned on it that represented all the dark influences that surround him. “This challenge was triggering,” Pressure says with a laugh. “I thought it was one thing, but it really was deeper.” Scott Youngblood...","Last week's episode of saw Pressure K leaving alongside Alexander the Great in a heartbreaking double elimination. While every episode thus far in this inaugural season of the groundbreaking series has delivered on both laughs and heartfelt moments (truly, this show is of drag), this week's hit even harder. This time, the challenge was all about tapping into and embodying the competitors' deepest fears, and what that meant for many of the kings was unpacking their trauma and opening up some of their most vulnerable sides to the world. Leading the charge in that regard was . The comic and pride of the Atlanta king community opened up in ways that neither the kings, the audience, the judges, but most of all ever expected (Pressure K uses he/him pronouns in drag, and she/her off stage). It began with the weenie challenge, in which the kings were tasked with creating a dual makeup look, one side of their face being beautiful and the other monstrous, using e.l.f. Cosmetics. It proved to be an emotional challenge for Pressure K, who revealed a traumatic experience and relationship with makeup. “I came home to makeup,” he shared with his fellow kings. A loaded statement that only becomes more harrowing when you hear the story behind it. Courtesy of Pressure K “My mother felt like she needed to teach me how to be a woman,” Pressure recalls to PRIDE. “So I was, like, legit taking classes. ' This is what a woman does.' Or like, if I do something, 'what you did is wrong, this is what you're supposed to do.' [It] got to a point where I felt like feminine activities became a punishment.” As a result of some perceived deviation from prescribed womanhood, one day in her teens, Pressure came home one day to find someone waiting for her. “I'm not exactly sure what I did. I might have, like, wore a hat, or they might have caught me in baggy clothes. I might have made an aggressive move, and I came home to the Mary Kay party,” she recalls. While Pressure put on a happy face, one she says her mother had trained her to adopt growing up, “I knew how to like...” Pressure says while demonstrating a happy expression. “People think I'm built for the camera.

Dies sehe ich als hervorragenden strategischen Schritt an, da die Marke „Rhode“ in kürzester Zeit ziemlich erfolgreich wurde. 👉Nun Infos zum Trade: Mit diesem Trade würde ich 100 Aktien von e.l.f.

mov_A2D8CC736AC52E156E7FA42BBFC11DC4,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Las estrellas usan su fama para crear prósperos negocios, según el semanario británico. Desde bebidas gaseosas y calzado hasta fragancias, a lo largo de los años los famosos han vendido de todo. En el pasado, la mayoría de las estrellas se conformaban con prestar sus rostros a campañas publicitarias a cambio de un poco de dinero extra. Algunos más emprendedores fueron un paso más allá y participaban en el diseño de los productos que promocionaban. En los años 80, un encuentro casual en un avión entre Jane Birkin, actriz británica, y un alto ejecutivo de Hermès, una marca de lujo, dio lugar a la creación del bolso Birkin. Por la misma época, Michael Jordan, la estrella del basquetbol, se asoció con Nike, una marca deportiva, para lanzar la línea de zapatillas deportivas Air Jordan. Sin embargo, más recientemente un número creciente de famosos ha optado por crear empresas de consumo propias. En la última década, los famosos, desde Beyoncé y Rihanna hasta George Clooney y Harry Styles, han lanzado líneas de belleza, marcas de bebidas alcohólicas, de ropa y mucho más. Un estudio realizado en 2023 por la empresa inmobiliaria JLL reveló que alrededor de tres quintas partes de las marcas minoristas de famosos en Estados Unidos se habían fundado en los seis años anteriores. Desde entonces, la tendencia ha continuado a buen ritmo, con la participación de estrellas como Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (cuidado de la piel masculina) y Emma Watson (ginebra), sir David Beckham (suplementos) y Wiz Khalifa (kits para cultivar setas). En mayo, Hailey Bieber, esposa de Justin Bieber, estrella del pop, vendió su marca de maquillaje Rhode a la firma de cosméticos e.l.f. Beauty por nada menos que US$ 1,000 millones. A medida que se difumina la frontera entre el comercio minorista y las redes sociales, los famosos están remodelando el mundo de los bienes de consumo. La proliferación de marcas de famosos es en parte un reflejo de los cambios en la industria de los medios de comunicación. En décadas pasadas, comunicarse con los consumidores estaba intermediado en gran medida por un puñado de canales de televisión, emisoras de radio y publicaciones impresas. Ya no. Hoy en día, dice Douglas Holt, un gurú de la mercadotecnia, cada cuenta de las redes sociales es un canal propio. Esto ha permitido a los famosos relacionarse directamente con sus fans. Kim Kardashian tiene más de 350 millones de seguidores en Instagram. A menudo usa Skims y habla de ellos en línea. “Kim es una directora creativa fenomenal”, dice Jens Grede, su cofundador, “pero también es una potencia mediática en solitario”. Según Launchmetrics, una empresa de análisis, el año pasado Skims generó más de US$ 600 millones en “valor de impacto mediático”, un indicador del beneficio monetario de las publicaciones online, la cobertura de prensa y otros tipos de exposición mediática. Esta cifra es ocho veces superior a la de Spanx, una marca rival de ropa moldeadora. Ahora los famosos no solo pueden comunicarse directamente con sus admiradores. También pueden venderles directamente. Las marcas emergentes ya no necesitan vender a través de grandes minoristas, que se llevan una parte de los beneficios, ni abrir tiendas físicas, lo que supone una enorme inversión inicial. Para vender en línea, ni siquiera necesitan pasar por plataformas de comercio electrónico como Amazon. Las herramientas como las que ofrece Shopify, una empresa de software canadiense, han facilitado más que nunca la creación de un sitio de comercio electrónico o una aplicación móvil. Las plataformas de redes sociales como TikTok también permiten ahora a las marcas vender directamente a los usuarios. Las ventas directas al consumidor han aumentado hasta representar alrededor de una séptima parte del comercio electrónico mundial, según NIQ, un proveedor de datos. Anita Balchandani, de la consultora McKinsey, calcula que representan hasta el 100% de los ingresos en los primeros días de una marca típica de famosos, y que descienden al 30%-60% a medida que las empresas se expanden y añaden la distribución por terceros. Por supuesto, no todas las marcas de famosos despegan. The Honest Company, fabricante de productos de belleza y para bebés cofundada por la actriz Jessica Alba, ha perdido tres cuartas partes de su valor de mercado desde que cotizó en bolsa en 2021. Alex Griffin, jefe de mercadotecnia de On, una marca de ropa deportiva que visten el tenista Roger Federer y la actriz Zendaya, dice que hay una razón por la que muchas estrellas siguen optando por los patrocinios en lugar de crear sus propias marcas: “No es tan fácil”. Elegir el tipo de producto adecuado es importante. La ropa y la bebida son cosas que la gente suele comprar por lo que simbolizan, más que por su funcionalidad, dice Sandra Cariglio, de ReD Associates, una empresa de asesoría. Eso los convierte en apuestas más seguras para los famosos. Naturalmente, a las estrellas atractivas también les resulta fácil vender productos de belleza. Ayuda que la producción de cosméticos sea fácil de subcontratar a fabricantes de marca blanca, como ocurre con las fragancias. Jill Avery, de la Harvard Business School, añade que los productos tienen que “encajar” con la propia marca del famoso. Las fans compran maquillaje a Hailey Bieber porque lleva mucho tiempo compartiendo consejos de belleza en Internet, y ropa moldeadora a Kim Kardashian porque es conocida por sus curvas. Cuando se le pregunta por qué lanza una aplicación para correr, Mo Farah, atleta con cuatro medallas de oro olímpicas a sus espaldas, dice sencillamente a The Economist: “Es lo único que sé”. Aun así, algunos famosos parecen capaces de vender cualquier cosa. Ryan Reynolds, estrella de comedias románticas convertido en superhéroe malhablado, se convirtió en 2019 en el rostro de Mint Mobile, una empresa de telecomunicaciones, tras adquirir alrededor del 25% del negocio. El año pasado, T-Mobile, un rival mayor, compró la empresa matriz de Mint por unos US$ 1,300 millones. En 2021, Reynolds se hizo con el Wrexham A.F.C., un equipo de fútbol galés en apuros, por 2 millones de libras (US$ 2.7 millones) junto con otro actor. La mejora en los resultados del equipo —y un documental ganador de un premio Emmy coproducido por Reynolds— han aumentado considerablemente su fama. Ahora se dice que el club está recaudando dinero con una valoración de hasta 350 millones de libras. Para los famosos que se dedican a los bienes de consumo, tener un producto decente es esencial.

「韓流帝王」SUPER JUNIOR帶著第十二張正規專輯《Super Junior25》回歸，此次是繼2022年12月發行的第十一張正規專輯Vol.2《The Road  Celebration》後，時隔約2年8個月的專輯，同時也是為了紀念團體出道20周年而發行，以此回顧歷程、展望未來。 專輯名稱延續出道作《Super Junior05》的命名脈絡，還是由成員發想而訂定，更增添特別意義。 成員表示這張並不是單純的專輯而已，更想把一起走過的二十年的時間，和其中發生過的故事傳給下一個世代，希望這段旅程能成為某些人在起點上的小小勇氣或希望，也想帶給後輩們“這樣堅持著、真心去做的話，是可能的”這樣的好先例。 而出道二十年來對SUPER JUNIOR來說變化最大和依然不變的部分，希澈表示變化最大的是自己的外貌，為了此次專輯很努力的減肥與控制飲食，不變的則是利特和銀赫的童顏與體重，看著兩人能獲得很大的激勵；藝聲覺得不變的是精神年齡，成員們至今仍像二十多歲的人；東海則感性表示變化最大的部分是成員對守護SUPER JUNIOR這個組合的心意更深了，不變的是對粉絲E.L.F.的心意和愛意。 ▲SUPER JUNIOR出道20周年。 （圖／SM Entertainment提供）
主打歌〈Express Mode〉是一首節奏明快、充滿能量的俱樂部風格的舞曲，結合極具動感的節奏與令人上癮的副歌旋律。 歌詞中傳遞出不滿足於當下，持續朝下個目標邁進的熱血態度。 神童介紹道「我們一直都在嘗試新事物嘛，這次真的苦惱很久，但一聽到〈Express Mode〉，大家馬上就覺得是這個了，這首歌曲有如SUPER JUNIOR般的活力與風趣，還有最近的感性，一聽就有主打歌的感覺」。 銀赫補充表示「既有不安於現狀、未來也會持續向前的意義，音樂和表演部分也能很好地將我們展現出來」。 為紀念專輯發行，回歸當天SUPER JUNIOR進行了倒數直播和線上Showcase與粉絲同樂。 尤其在Showcase中首次公開主打歌〈Express Mode〉和收錄曲〈Haircut〉、〈我們的花語 (Stuck With You)〉的舞台，還表演了經典歌曲〈U〉、〈SORRY, SORRY〉與〈So I〉，勁歌熱舞的帥氣模樣使人目不轉睛，其中〈SORRY, SORRY〉的舞台，希澈的solo爵士鼓秀時隔多年再度重現，令粉絲們大呼感動。 更多三立新聞網報導

One of the most prominent is the rising beauty consciousness among consumers. There is increasing awareness of aesthetics and personal grooming, especially among women. This is expected to drive demand for eyelash serums and other cosmetic enhancements during the forecast period. Celebrities, influencers, and social media trends are also playing a key role in fueling interest in long, thick eyelashes. This directly influences the eyelash serum market growth, and the trend will likely persist in the coming years. Immediate Delivery Available | Buy This Premium Research Report: Alternatives and Counterfeit Products Limiting Market Growth The future eyelash serum market outlook appears optimistic, owing to rising popularity of personal grooming trends. However, availability of alternatives and penetration of counterfeit products are significant barriers to widespread market expansion. Many consumers opt for alternative like eyelash extensions, mascaras, and false eyelashes for instant results. Adoption of these options may reduce eyelash serum market demand during the forecast period. Similarly, there is an increase in counterfeit products on e-commerce platforms. This can damage brand reputation as well as erode consumer trust, thereby negatively impacting eyelash serum market growth. Growing Preference for Non-Invasive Beauty Solutions Creating Growth Opportunities Modern consumers are increasingly seeking alternatives to eyelash extensions or surgeries. This puts eyelash serums into the limelight, offering a non-invasive, easy-to-apply, and cost-effective solution for enhancing lash growth. Thus, rising preference for non-invasive beauty solutions is expected to open new revenue-generation streams for eyelash serum manufacturers. Expansion of online shopping platforms and direct-to-consumer brands is making eyelash serums more accessible globally. Rising sales of eyelash serums through these online platforms will further boost market growth during the assessment period. Impact of AI on the Eyelash Serum Market Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making a notable impact on the eyelash serum market. It helps eyelash serum companies in product development, personalization, and marketing. AI-powered data analytics enable brands to analyze consumer feedback, usage patterns, and market trends. Similarly, AI tools like Ulta's GLAMlab let users preview beauty products, such as eyelash serums, boosting confidence and conversions. Emerging Eyelash Serum Market Trends Rising personalization trend is expected to trigger growth of the eyelash serum market during the assessment period. Top eyelash serum manufacturers are testing personalized serums to match individual needs as well as preferences. Increasing social media influence and celebrity endorsements is acting as a catalyst for market growth. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram play a crucial role in promoting eyelash serums through viral content, influencer reviews, and beauty tutorials. Ongoing product innovations are also contributing to expansion of the eyelash serum market. Leading brands are increasing using natural, vegan, and chemical-free ingredients to woo health-conscious and eco-aware consumers. Manufacturers of eyelash serums are also focusing on developing advanced serums enriched with biotin, peptides, and plant-based compounds for improved effectiveness. Similarly, they are shifting their preference towards using sustainable packaging and eco-friendly practices. Such innovations will positively impact eyelash serum sales growth in the coming years. Growing eyelash serum demand from the male grooming segment is expected to boost market growth. An increasing number of men are exploring eyelash and eyebrow products as part of their grooming routines....",2025-07-09 14:40:00,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The provided content is a market research report about the global eyelash serum market and does not mention e.l.f. specifically.

I found the right brush and the right combination to make this color work for me (I mix it with a softer warm blush)~~ 80. ~~A product from a previous project pan - Kilo Milano Create Your Balance Soft Touch Lip&Cheek in Velvet Bliss - 10/10. ~~ (It's not my favorite product, but layering it with other lip products that have the same color range helped me to use it more) 61. ~~Something bright - NYX Buttermelt Blush in Butta Than Before - 5/5. ~~ (I tried as much as I could to make this shade work by using it in new ways and with different brushes -I didn't count those ""test"" usages - but I'd instead declutter it because it's too pigmented and the shade doesn't work for me) 55. ~~A spray - Nyx Dewy Finish Setting Spray - 7/7. ~~ (I like it. The more I use it, the more I realize I don't like matte setting spray, so I'll repurchase it once it's done.) 32. ~~An eyeshadow - Glamshop Laser - 5/3. I used it as a toper on my nails and I loved it. ~~ 65. ~~Something autumnal - Haus Labs Color Fuse Powder Blush in Fire Moon - 5/5 - I still trying to make that color work on me because it look horrendous on my undertone. ~~ 59. ~~Something high-maintenance - NYX Professional Makeup Lift & Snatch Brow Tint Pen in Espresso - 10/10 - I like it again since I found a way to use it without it being too much of a hassle. I'll get a darker shade once I finish it. ~~ 16. ~~Something cool-toned - SEPHORA COLLECTION's About That Shine Sheer Shine Lipstick in Blinding Pink - 5/5 - I still find it too bright for an everyday look but it's easy to layer other products on top to tone down the color. ~~ 78. ~~A limited edition or discontinued product - Blend Bunny Forget Me Not palette - 10/10 - I fell in love again off this palette. I know it's one of the unpopular releases but I'm so glad I got my hands on it. I can use it for a wash of color on the eyes with the shimmer, for mapping the outline and fill in my brows, add warmth or cool to my face. ~~ ~~40. Something fun - By BEAUTY BAY Mini Charms Colour Palette - 10/10 - I'm still amazed by the fact that a palette of this quality is sold for just 12 euros. Although all the shimmers don't have the same wow effect, they exceeded my expectations because the swatches didn't do them justice, as far as I'm concerned. If it's still available, I really recommend getting one. ~~ **Ongoing:** 34. A bronzer - e.l.f. Luminous Putty Bronzer in Sun Chaser - 5/10 66.

mov_93D3CE7E2C56EBAF1171BFDD2BC25C15,"  Your beauty drawer is going to be *very* happy to welcome these two $7 cult-fave Clinique and Laneige lip alternatives. 1. E.l.f.'s Hydrating Core Lip Shine in the ""Ecstatic"" shade, which reviewers say captures the some magic as ""Black Honey,"" the $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique that's blowing up on TikTok at a fraction of the price. It doesn't shift colors as magically as the other version, but it's a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lip. I personally will live, breathe, and die by the magic of $25 ""universal"" Black Honey version — it lasts FOREVER and also functions as the perfect blush — but it sells out so often that I am also deeply relieved to know it has a cheap alternative in case of lip emergency! Promising review: ""I absolutely love this product. The dark color is perfectly sheer. It also adds the most beautiful color to your lips. I am a Clinique Black Honey lip fan, and this gives me the same look for a fraction of the cost. I love it and have multiple that I keep in various spots. Not sticky either, which is my biggest gripe about lip glosses. My hair doesn't get stuck in this like some glosses, but I get the shine."" —Hamps5 Get it from Amazon for $6 (also available in four other shades). 2. A set of square stemmed wineglasses inspired by the iconic Crate & Barrel version, except these are durable as heck (good for particularly rowdy wine-and-cheese nights). Reviewers especially love these chic, understated glasses because they work well for red and white wines. Promising review: ""We've had four of these glasses for over six months now and finally just added four more to our collection. These glasses are SO CHIC and are very similar to ones sold at Crate & Barrel but are MUCH more durable. Unlike the C&B glasses, you can cheers without feeling like the glasses will break. In fact, they've tipped over in the sink a few times and are still intact. They dry beautifully, sparkle after the dishwasher and we get so many compliments on them. I love them!"" —Katie B Get a set of two from Amazon for $27.99. 3. L'Oréal Paris Makeup True Match Lumi Glotion designed to enhance your skin's natural ✨ glow✨ just like the pricy Drunk Elephant drops — perfect for anyone who wants a lightweight alternative to foundation or just a lil' extra low-effort, ethereal shimmer in their lives. Promising review: ""Love love love this stuff. This is such a stellar product that is so versatile. Can be worn alone to put some glowy life to skin. Add to foundation or layer it. Beautiful. Use it as a base where you put highlighter on top. Mix some with moisturizer. This, in my opinion, is better than so many high-luxury brands that make similar products. And I am pretty sure it can be used by all skin types. It's not an oily feeling at all, and it doesn't dry out the skin either. Just a total package. Can't beat the price either."" —Figgy08 Get it from Amazon for $13.98 (available in five shades). 4. Glossmetics' Lychee Overnight Lip Mask, a Laneige or Tatcha alternatve that's already a cult-fave in the making — you can wear this non-stick, ultra glossy lip shine during the day or overnight as a lip treatment to help hydrate, soften, and condition your lips. Not to mention you will taste *delectable* all day and night (just ask the many lychee martinis I have downed on this here earth!) . Promising review: ""I'm obsessed with lip products. I have tried everything you can imagine, inexpensive and expensive. This is my favorite lip product I've purchased.

mov_ECA30C396618847039C0F5136760A72C,"  ...and you'll definitely get your money's worth since you'll use these items daily. 1. Lawless's ""Forget The Filler"" in a variety of delectable flavors (birthday cake!!!) — it'll hydrate your lips overnight (similar to Laneige's repairing sleep mask) and make your pout fuller. It's made of shea butter, hyaluronic acid, and a stimulating peptide complex that work so magically together you won't ever want to run out. Promising review: ""Really makes a difference. First overnight treatment I've used where my lips genuinely feel hydrated and plumper in the morning. I'm pleasantly surprised — I bought this on a whim after a rec from The Strategist and almost canceled the order. Now I use it every night!"" —Hilary Get it from Amazon $22 (available in five flavors). 2. Clinique Almost Lipstick Tinted Lip Balm in Black Honey that has been *all the rage* on TikTok (which is how you know it's good). It's lightweight, has a touch of gloss to it, and the shade will have you saying ""mhmmmm, honey!"" from the second you apply it. BuzzFeed writer Emma Lord has personally tested this baby out. She said: ""I was very adamant about not buying this for the longest time because I am stubborn about ""expensive"" beauty products, but this is worth every penny and then some. It's so lightweight and layerable, it's foolproof to apply, and I have yet to wear a single outfit it doesn't complement??? I love watching it instantly elevate a casual look or add simple elegance to dressy ones. I wear it every day now, and after weeks of use, I've barely made a dent. Also, and maybe this is just me, but I tend to get pigment on my teeth with a lot of lip products, and I've simply never had an issue with this magic stick. Anyway, watch this TikTok of someone using it on their lips AND cheeks, because I did and oops, this lipstick FELL into my cart."" Get it from Amazon for $25 (available in two shades). 3. Sol De Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream featuring scent notes of vanilla, pistachio, and salted caramel you'll enjoy applying to your skin just as much as you'd like it as an ice cream sundae. It's also filled with vitamin E, caffeine, coconut oil, and guarana extract to help smooth, firm, and hydrate your skin. BuzzFeed editor Elizabeth Lilly says, ""I've used this stuff before and can confirm that 1) the scent is indeed intoxicating and 2) everything from this brand has scents that really STICK to you. I'm currently using the Beija Flor body wash and I can smell it on my skin hours later — which is pretty rare for a body wash."" Promising review: ""I am 60 and I could not get rid of the cellulite on my legs. I started using this product six weeks ago and can noticeably see a difference. I apply morning and evening, before bed for optimal results. It goes on smooth and has a creamy, nonsticky feel. The smell is dreamy, and even my husband has commented on the improvement. Make sure you apply in a circular motion for optimal coverage, absorption and circulation."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24 (available in three sizes and in packs). 4. A motivating daily planner that literally says ""You've got this!"" at the top — it'll also look oh-so-cute on your desk or fridge and has sections to keep track of appointments, how much water you're drinking, a to-do list, what you ate (meal prep, perhaps?!) and a general notes/doodling area. Each pad comes with 50 sheets. Promising review: ""I use this first thing when I get in the office in the mornings as a 'personal to-do' before our morning meetings. It reminds me to stay productive when I might not have work to do in the office at that moment, but it also reminds me throughout the day of the intention I set early on. It's been a great visual reminder of my personal goals while I'm achieving professional goals."" —Chelsea Ashton Get it from Amazon for $5.99+ (available in five sizes and 17 styles). 5. Gradient tempered glass for your iPhone — it'll act as a privacy screen (sorry to the Nosy Nancy sitting next to you on the subway, they won't be able to see your texts to your mom), will help filter blue light, prevent your screen from scratching, and add a little bit of *~flair~* to your phone in the process. Psst: Read more about the effects of blue light and eye strain at UC Davis Health and the American Academy of Ophthalmology....","...and you'll definitely get your money's worth since you'll use these items daily. 1. Lawless's ""Forget The Filler"" in a variety of delectable flavors (birthday cake!!!) — it'll hydrate your lips overnight (similar to Laneige's repairing sleep mask) and make your pout fuller. It's made of shea butter, hyaluronic acid, and a stimulating peptide complex that work so magically together you won't ever want to run out. Promising review: ""Really makes a difference. First overnight treatment I've used where my lips genuinely feel hydrated and plumper in the morning. I'm pleasantly surprised — I bought this on a whim after a rec from The Strategist and almost canceled the order. Now I use it every night!"" —Hilary Get it from Amazon $22 (available in five flavors). 2. Clinique Almost Lipstick Tinted Lip Balm in Black Honey that has been *all the rage* on TikTok (which is how you know it's good). It's lightweight, has a touch of gloss to it, and the shade will have you saying ""mhmmmm, honey!"" from the second you apply it. BuzzFeed writer Emma Lord has personally tested this baby out. She said: ""I was very adamant about not buying this for the longest time because I am stubborn about ""expensive"" beauty products, but this is worth every penny and then some. It's so lightweight and layerable, it's foolproof to apply, and I have yet to wear a single outfit it doesn't complement??? I love watching it instantly elevate a casual look or add simple elegance to dressy ones. I wear it every day now, and after weeks of use, I've barely made a dent. Also, and maybe this is just me, but I tend to get pigment on my teeth with a lot of lip products, and I've simply never had an issue with this magic stick. Anyway, watch this TikTok of someone using it on their lips AND cheeks, because I did and oops, this lipstick FELL into my cart."" Get it from Amazon for $25 (available in two shades). 3. Sol De Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream featuring scent notes of vanilla, pistachio, and salted caramel you'll enjoy applying to your skin just as much as you'd like it as an ice cream sundae. It's also filled with vitamin E, caffeine, coconut oil, and guarana extract to help smooth, firm, and hydrate your skin. BuzzFeed editor Elizabeth Lilly says, ""I've used this stuff before and can confirm that 1) the scent is indeed intoxicating and 2) everything from this brand has scents that really STICK to you. I'm currently using the Beija Flor body wash and I can smell it on my skin hours later — which is pretty rare for a body wash."" Promising review: ""I am 60 and I could not get rid of the cellulite on my legs. I started using this product six weeks ago and can noticeably see a difference. I apply morning and evening, before bed for optimal results. It goes on smooth and has a creamy, nonsticky feel. The smell is dreamy, and even my husband has commented on the improvement. Make sure you apply in a circular motion for optimal coverage, absorption and circulation."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24 (available in three sizes and in packs). 4. A motivating daily planner that literally says ""You've got this!"" at the top — it'll also look oh-so-cute on your desk or fridge and has sections to keep track of appointments, how much water you're drinking, a to-do list, what you ate (meal prep, perhaps?!) and a general notes/doodling area. Each pad comes with 50 sheets. Promising review: ""I use this first thing when I get in the office in the mornings as a 'personal to-do' before our morning meetings. It reminds me to stay productive when I might not have work to do in the office at that moment, but it also reminds me throughout the day of the intention I set early on. It's been a great visual reminder of my personal goals while I'm achieving professional goals."" —Chelsea Ashton Get it from Amazon for $5.99+ (available in five sizes and 17 styles). 5. Gradient tempered glass for your iPhone — it'll act as a privacy screen (sorry to the Nosy Nancy sitting next to you on the subway, they won't be able to see your texts to your mom), will help filter blue light, prevent your screen from scratching, and add a little bit of *~flair~* to your phone in the process.

mov_DC94EA846D6FCA5D7C6F8B6307A2776E,"  Ulta Beauty's new chief executive officer Kecia Steelman continues to make significant moves, this time snapping up Space NK from investment firm Manzanita Capital. Terms of the deal were not disclosed apart from that the purchase was funded with cash on hand and capacity under Ulta's existing credit facility. More from WWD Press reports from last year suggested Manzanita was searching for a deal valued between 300 million pounds and 400 million pounds. Space NK, which has 83 stores in the U.K. and Ireland, will operate as a stand-alone subsidiary of Ulta Beauty and will continue to be led by its existing management team, including CEO Andy Lightfoot. “Today's announcement marks an exciting step forward for Ulta Beauty's global expansion efforts, adding the U.K. market to our existing planned openings in Mexico and the Middle East later this year,” said Steelman. “Space NK is a beloved brand with a strong operating model and customer loyalty, and we couldn't be more thrilled to welcome the brand into the Ulta Beauty family.” Space NK was founded in Covent Garden in 1993 by Nicky Kinnaird as a glossy destination for niche, international brands — many of them skin care — that were difficult to find in the U.K. It had been part of Manzanita Capital for 23 years. Reports that the firm was trying to sell Space NK emerged in April 2024. It previously tried to off-load it in 2018, before deciding to pull the retailer off the market. Bill Fisher, CEO and founder of Manzanita Capital, said: “I have every confidence that Ulta Beauty and this terrific management team will take Space NK to new heights.” Lightfoot added that he was excited by the opportunity to join Ulta Beauty and “benefit from its scale, brand relationships and resources.” “This acquisition sets both companies on a path to further success and importantly, enables us to reach more beauty enthusiasts throughout the world at scale. As a collective force of talented, passionate teams, I'm confident we will take Space NK to new heights,” he continued. The U.S. wholesale division of Space NK, which entails roughly 600 points of distribution across Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, Hudson's Bay and the company's shop-in-shop collaboration with Walmart and Beauty SpaceNK, was acquired by PCA Companies in June 2024. Since taking the reins as CEO of Ulta at the beginning of this year, Steelman has been executing its international expansion. Later this year Ulta will debut in Mexico through a joint venture with Axo, before arriving in the Middle East via a licensing agreement with Alshaya Group. In the Middle East, the first locations will be in Dubai and Kuwait City, with one store in each location to begin with, although the strategy is to expand quickly. It's the same story in Mexico. “We're getting ready to launch in the back half of 2025 for Mexico, and it will probably be in the later half of the year for the Middle East. For Mexico, it's a joint venture with Axo. We're very excited about our partnership. The teams are working very well together. We believe we can get 10 stores open in a pretty short period of time,” Steelman said during an April interview with WWD. “In regards to the Middle East, that's actually a licensed agreement that we're doing with Alshaya Group. We've talked to Alshaya Group for quite some time, and feel like they're a fantastic partner for us to bring our brand to life in the Middle East.” Thursday's announcement that Ulta is acquiring Spake NK is yet another sign that beauty M&A is picking up after a lengthy slowdown. Other recent deals include L'Oréal snapping up Medik8 and Color Wow, E.l.f. Beauty buying Hailey Bieber's Rhode and Unilever's purchase of Dr. Squatch. Other beauty brands that have been in the market for some time will no doubt be hoping that this thawing means they will soon have some success. Best of WWD Sign up for WWD's Newsletter.

mov_938934D3DC646AFCBCD354E2E246EC91,"  Healthy, glowing skin straight from your bathroom Last year, we renovated our house. It cost a fortune. So holidays abroad were well and truly put on hold. As a result, I have become a dab hand at faking that gorgeous glow that you really only get after a week or two on holiday. I'm talking unrivalled radiance, sun-kissed cheeks and golden limbs that make every outfit look better. As a beauty editor, I've made it my mission over the past year to find the products that warm up the skin to make me look (and feel) healthier quickly. From tinted SPFs and bronzers, to instant tans and illuminating primers, trust me when I say I have done the legwork to find out which products apply well, look most natural and crucially, make me look radiant and tanned. Because, call me fickle, that's all I really ever want. Here I break down the different steps of my ultimate instant glow routine, which I swear by... My love of self-tan started with tanning drops. As a naturally fair 'English rose', I had always been incredibly nervous of fake tan and the inevitable mishaps that come with it. However, when I was introduced to the Isle Of Paradise Self Tanning Drops, I liked that they gave me the sense of control. It wasn't long before these little drops of sunshine became a firm fixture in my everyday skincare routine. I believe the recommendation is to use them every other day, but a few drops in my moisturiser every morning means that my skin always has a lovely, glowy canvas to apply the rest of my products. The Caudalie Self-Tan Sun Drops have become another favourite. To avoid any obvious tell-tale signs around my hairline, I use a big kabuki brush to buff my moisturiser and tanning drops in, which allows for a more natural finish. Isle of Paradise elf Tanning Face Drops in Medium Self-Tan Sun Drops Once I've applied my moisturiser, laced with tanning drops, I go in with my SPF. I've always loved a product that does more, and a base product with added sun protection is right up my street. Heliocare's 360 Colour Water Gel Bronze SPF50+ gives my skin just the right amount of coverage, evens out any irregular tone in an instant and blends in beautifully. The texture is similar to a lightweight foundation, so once I've applied it with my hands, I often buff it in with a foundation brush in areas that need thinning out slightly, like around my nose. Despite its name, it warms, rather than bronzes, the skin. And it does so beautifully. The viral Beauty of Joseon Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen is another knockout product, with 12 shades to choose from. 360 Colour Water Gel Bronze SPF50+ Beauty of Joseon Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen SPF30 PA+++ Every time I wear the L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion, I receive a compliment. Not only does it add a touch of colour to the skin, but it's the pearlescent sheen that it leaves behind that really makes a difference. You can use it as a primer, as I like to, tapped in as a highlighter or mixed in with your foundation for a more subtle finish. Vieve's iconic Skin Nova Instant Radiance Primer works similarly, but without the bronzing effect. Both transform tired skin in an instant. L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion Skin Nova Instant Radiance Primer Bronzer is arguably the must-have product in any glowing skin routine. Everybody has a preferred texture; mine will always be cream. I have dry and often dehydrated skin, so I prefer cream and liquid textures that won't settle in dry patches or fine lines. I couldn't write about tanned-looking skin without including Chanel's mega (in size and results) Les Beiges Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream. Not only does it give a natural-looking effect (which is down to its velvet matte finish), but it lasts and lasts, so is worth the investment. Earlier this year, the shade range grew, meaning it finally works for all skin tones. I can't ignore the fact that this giant bronzer does not travel well, so when I'm away from home or on the go, I use the Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Truffle. This twist-up cream bronzer has a slightly dewier finish compared to Chanel's, but the pigment payoff is great, and stick formulations make for easy application. Les Beiges Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Truffle In the middle of last summer, blonzing (a technique that blends bronzer and blusher together) became a viral make-up trend....","Healthy, glowing skin straight from your bathroom Last year, we renovated our house.

While technology stocks get a lot of attention, and deservedly so, the consumer space is also full of solid companies with long growth trajectories. Here's a look at five consumer-focused stocks built for growth to buy and hold for the the long haul. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue » Amazon There is a reason why Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) The company is using AI to predict the best routes and even to make it easier for drivers to navigate complex drop-offs at places like large apartment buildings. It's also using AI to predict the best warehouses to store items in order to reduce shipping mileage and times. On top of that, it has invested heavily in robots, that with advancements in AI are now able to take on increasingly complex tasks. Its robots aren't just moving boxes and lifting heavy items, some have a sense of touch and can grab items in tough-to-reach places and others can spot damaged items, helping the company save money on costly returns. At the same time, Amazon continues to be a cloud computing leader with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It has created software tools that make it easy for developers to build and deploy AI models and tools, while the company has also developed its own proprietary chips for AI training and inference that give it a cost advantage over off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs). Put it all together, and Amazon is building one of the most powerful and defensible platforms on the planet. e.l.f. Beauty e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) Rhode brings with it higher price points and a strong skincare portfolio. That complements e.l.f.'s mass-market cosmetic lines and opens up cross-sell opportunities, as it's common in the beauty industry for consumers to use both prestige and mass products. Meanwhile, Hailey Bieber will stay on as chief creative officer, and e.l.f. will surely want to ramp up Rhode's product offerings. E.l.f. has already shown it knows how to gain share in a crowded market. It continues to expand internationally, and it should have opportunities in other adjacent markets down the road, like fragrance. With its brand-building track record and influencer marketing, e.l.f. has plenty of growth ahead. Dutch Bros One of the best themes to invest in in the consumer space is expansion, and Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) The company just rolled out mobile ordering, which should boost throughput, and it is finally looking to roll out more food options, an area where it's been notably absent. Breakfast is a massive category, and Dutch Bros has acknowledged that not offering food items during this important daypart has likely cost it sales. If its food pilot proves successful, it could be a significant driver of same-store growth. Between new food offerings and expansion, this is a stock to own for the long haul. Cava Group Another great restaurant expansion story in progress right now is Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) The introduction of grilled steak to its menu last year was a game changer, and its menu continues to evolve and improve. Its added higher-margin items like fresh juices, and add-ons are already boosting average tickets. Cava is also experimenting with new dishes and a loyalty program to keep customers coming back. The big story, though, is still geographic expansion. With under 400 locations at the end of last quarter and a target of 1,000 by 2032, Cava's growth runway is wide open. Its ""coastal smile "" expansion strategy has worked well, and now it's starting to enter major Midwest markets like Chicago and Detroit. Cava has plenty of growth in front of it. Philip Morris International Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) Zyn has become the breakout nicotine pouch brand in the U.S., with volumes up over 50% last quarter. The company acquired the brand when it bought Swedish Match in 2022, in what has to be one of the best deals in the consumer space over the past several years. Meanwhile, Iqos continues to take share overseas, especially in Europe and Japan, and is making inroads in newer markets like Mexico City and Jakarta. The company also bought back the U.S. rights to Iqos, giving it another potential growth driver in one of the world's biggest markets. At the same time, Philip Morris still runs a profitable legacy cigarette business overseas, where pricing remains strong and volumes are more stable. Importantly, the company typically uses local manufacturing, including with Zyn, meaning it faces little tariff risk. All in all, Philip Morris is a great growth stock in a defensive industry.

Here are five monster stocks to buy right now and hold for the next five years or more. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue » 1. Amazon While Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Another behind-the-scenes area where Amazon is a market leader is robotics. The company is the world's largest operator of mobile robots, having just deployed its millionth robot, which is working at one of its fulfillment centers. These robots aren't just moving boxes, they are detecting damaged goods, navigating tight aisles, and even fixing themselves. Meanwhile, the company recently introduced its DeepFleet AI model to coordinate the movement of its entire fleet of robots in order to save time and boost throughput. The company is also using AI to create better delivery routes and make it easier for drivers to find difficult drop-off locations within large apartment or office complexes. All of this is making Amazon more efficient and should lead to strong earnings growth in the years ahead. 2. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) However, the company's bigger opportunity lies in custom AI chips. Broadcom helped Alphabet design its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and now it has multiple customers developing their own custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These chips can offer better efficiency and performance than off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs), and Broadcom has become the primary partner for several top tech companies that are creating their own custom AI ASICs. Broadcom estimates that its three customers furthest along in their development could each deploy 1 million AI chip clusters by fiscal 2027, representing a $60 billion to $90 billion total serviceable addressable market. That's a big potential growth opportunity for the company in the years ahead. 3. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) At the same time, Meta's new AI tools are improving both ad creativity and targeting, leading to better ad performance. Last quarter, ad impressions rose 5% while average price per ad jumped 10%, demonstrating that its platform is becoming more effective for marketers. In addition, Meta has two new monetization opportunities emerging. The company just started serving ads on its popular messaging platform, WhatsApp, which boasts more than 3 billion users. At the same time, it's also begun to gradually serve ads to its new social media platform Threads, which had more than 350 million monthly users as of last quarter and is growing quickly. Between the better monetization of its core platforms and new opportunities with WhatsApp and Threads, Meta has a solid growth outlook over the next several years. 4. Philip Morris International Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) Internationally, Iqos is gaining strong traction. The company sold more than 37 billion heated tobacco units last quarter, with strong growth in Japan and Europe. Philip Morris recently regained U.S. rights to Iqos and is piloting it in Austin, Texas. Once the FDA clears its latest device, a broader U.S. rollout could begin. Best of all, this would not cannibalize existing sales, since Philip Morris doesn't sell cigarettes in the U.S. What really sets these products apart, though, are their unit economics. Zyn is 6 times more profitable than traditional cigarettes, while Iqos is more than twice as profitable. In addition, Philip Morris tends to use local manufacturing, which shields it from any tariffs. With global cigarette sales still holding up outside the U.S., Philip Morris is a rare growth stock in a defensive industry. 5. E.l.f. Beauty E.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) Rhode was already set to expand into Sephora stores this year, and e.l.f. has strong relationships with retailers Ulta Beauty and Target. Increased distribution is one of the surest ways to increase growth, and e.l.f. will have a long runway of getting Rhode products onto retail shelfs. The deal also diversifies e.l.f. into prestige skincare and cosmetics, complementing its mass-market cosmetics base. That should boost margins and expand its reach to a slightly more affluent demographic. While the company will face tariff headwinds, the Rhode deal should help power strong growth in the years ahead.

The “All About That Bass” singer, 31, shared on the July 10th episode of her podcast, Workin' On, that she caught a bug that went through her family — that's puzzlingly enough making her tongue burn. “I'm sick,” she said. “Yet again, but I'm not on antibiotics. I'm gonna fight it.” She then shared son Riley, 4, was the first to get sick, before the illness spread to husband Daryl Sabara, and then youngest son Barry, 2. “I have it because I just got sick, and then, I should get sick again,” she explained, her voice raspy. ” And my tongue is still burning.

It's a symptom of the mysterious burning mouth syndrome, which the Mayo Clinic explains is a painful sensation inside the mouth that doesn't have an obvious cause, but symptoms are similar to the burn felt after drinking a hot beverage. Trainor, who recently launched a “Cloud Skin” makeup collab with e.l.f. Cosmetics, shared that she's been treating it with mouthwash more than four times a day, but so far, the symptoms haven't abated, much to her doctor's surprise. “She goes, 'My last patient said after two swishes, she was fine. So, you'll heal right up.' And I'm like, 'I'm on day three. So, when's the healing right up going to happen?' Little concerned, a little worried,” she said. Oral rinses and mouthwashes can help numb the symptoms, the Mayo Clinic says, along with nerve blockers and other types of medications to relieve pain. Overall, Trainor said she's “not feeling good,” adding she “hawked lugies” that morning. “I'm like, I'm having a great time in life other than this.

mov_BED03247F68E24FB04A2E7D930FE3443,"  Is it finally clocking to you? Justin Bieber is back. The 31-year-old singer surprise-released a new album, ""Swag,"" Friday after teasing fans the previous morning with a series of billboards and social media posts. Bieber's first album since 2021's ""Justice,"" the new music prompted an online frenzy and revived a devoted community of Beliebers. From his marriage to his paparazzi encounters, Bieber has faced incredible scrutiny over the last few months, which he addresses head-on in ""Swag."" After listening to all 21 tracks, here are our biggest takeaways. Bieber has incorporated R&B elements in his music since early in his career and embraced the genre fully on the 2013 compilation album ""Journals."" But even after coining R&Bieber in 2019, he's struggled to be taken seriously. When 2020's ""Changes"" received a Grammy nomination for pop vocal album, Bieber expressed his confusion at not being nominated in the R&B category. ""To the Grammys I am flattered to be acknowledged and appreciated for my artistry. I am very meticulous and intentional about my music. With that being said I set out to make an R&B album. ' Changes' was and is an R&B album,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""It is not being acknowledged as an R&B album which is very strange to me. I grew up admiring R&B music and wished to make a project that would embody that sound."" ""To be clear I absolutely love Pop music,"" he added. ""It just wasn't what I set out to make this time around. My gratitude for feeling respected for my work remains and I am honored to be nominated either way."" On ""Swag,"" Bieber shows off his R&B chops. From opening track ""All I Can Take"" and the seemingly SZA-inspired ""Yukon"" to ""Daisies"" (which reportedly features Mk.gee on the guitar), he takes a more intimate approach than on previous albums. But still, longtime fans will hear hints of ""Journals"" and ""Changes"" throughout the project. In one of the album's unconventional moments, comedian Druski comments on Bieber's more ""soulful,"" R&B-infused sound. ""I said this album kinda sound, you got some soul on this album too, bro,"" he says on the interlude track ""Soulful."" ""Your skin white but your soul Black, Justin. I promise you, man."" Since Justin and Hailey Bieber wed in 2018, their marriage has been under a microscope. Divorce rumors circulated within months of them tying the knot, and it didn't help that many fans were still rooting for the singer to get back with ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. Bieber's love for his wife is evident throughout his catalog - from 2020's ""All Around Me"" to 2021's ""Hailey."" But in case anyone is still skeptical (they are), Bieber sets the record straight on ""Swag."" On album standout ""Walking Away,"" Bieber gets candid about his relationship troubles but also reaffirms that he's committed to his marriage. ""You were my diamond / Gave you a ring / I made you a promise / I told you I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away,"" he sings. Elsewhere on the album, he cheers on his wife. On ""Go Baby"" (which lyrically echoes 2021's ""There She Go""), he sings, ""That's my baby, she's iconic, iPhone case, lip gloss on it"" - a reference to the Rhode founder's famous lip gloss-holder phone case. Recently, Hailey sold her skin-care company, which she launched in 2022, to e.l.f Beauty for $1 billion. There she goes indeed. The Biebers' pregnancy announcement in May 2024 was accompanied by an unknown instrumental track. Now, fans have identified it as ""Devotion"" featuring Dijon. On the heartwarming track, Bieber sings, ""When your lips and fingernails are all mine / I promise to take my time givin' you devotion."" The singer also celebrates being a father to Jack Blues Bieber, born Aug. 23, 2024, on ""Dadz Love."" As rapper Lil B declares we need ""less hatin'"" and ""more love,"" Bieber repeats the track title (which sounds like ""that's love"") over and over. Soon after the singer announced the surprise album, fans flocked to social media to express their excitement. ""New album - bieber fever hitting like it's 2010,"" TikTok user @jennyboba posted to the will.i.am collab ""#thatPOWER."" ""Justin Bieber is back… I used to pray for times like this,"" singer d4vd posted on X. Others reactivated their old X fan accounts and created group chats to celebrate the release. ""We're creating a SWAG group chat to keep up with all the updates! Like or reply so I can add you,"" @statsonbieber announced in a post that's since received almost 6,000 likes and more than 600 comments. Bieber fever may have been latent for years, but it's making the rounds once again. Bieber's had his fair share of viral paparazzi moments over the past year. Most notable was his encounter with photographers while leaving Malibu's SoHo House, when he declared, ""It's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business."" The singer's misuse of African American Vernacular English has turned into an internet meme, but Bieber's in on the joke....","Is it finally clocking to you? Justin Bieber is back.

mov_131A63CB5B140FF0D349CDCF1CCF57B6,"  Is it finally clocking to you? Justin Bieber is back. The 31-year-old singer surprise-released a new album, ""Swag,"" Friday after teasing fans the previous morning with a series of billboards and social media posts. Bieber's first album since 2021's ""Justice,"" the new music prompted an online frenzy and revived a devoted community of Beliebers. From his marriage to his paparazzi encounters, Bieber has faced incredible scrutiny over the last few months, which he addresses head-on in ""Swag."" After listening to all 21 tracks, here are our biggest takeaways. Bieber has incorporated R&B elements in his music since early in his career and embraced the genre fully on the 2013 compilation album ""Journals."" But even after coining R&Bieber in 2019, he's struggled to be taken seriously. When 2020's ""Changes"" received a Grammy nomination for pop vocal album, Bieber expressed his confusion at not being nominated in the R&B category. ""To the Grammys I am flattered to be acknowledged and appreciated for my artistry. I am very meticulous and intentional about my music. With that being said I set out to make an R&B album. ' Changes' was and is an R&B album,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""It is not being acknowledged as an R&B album which is very strange to me. I grew up admiring R&B music and wished to make a project that would embody that sound."" ""To be clear I absolutely love Pop music,"" he added. ""It just wasn't what I set out to make this time around. My gratitude for feeling respected for my work remains and I am honored to be nominated either way."" On ""Swag,"" Bieber shows off his R&B chops. From opening track ""All I Can Take"" and the seemingly SZA-inspired ""Yukon"" to ""Daisies"" (which reportedly features Mk.gee on the guitar), he takes a more intimate approach than on previous albums. But still, longtime fans will hear hints of ""Journals"" and ""Changes"" throughout the project. In one of the album's unconventional moments, comedian Druski comments on Bieber's more ""soulful,"" R&B-infused sound. ""I said this album kinda sound, you got some soul on this album too, bro,"" he says on the interlude track ""Soulful."" ""Your skin white but your soul Black, Justin. I promise you, man."" Since Justin and Hailey Bieber wed in 2018, their marriage has been under a microscope. Divorce rumors circulated within months of them tying the knot, and it didn't help that many fans were still rooting for the singer to get back with ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. Bieber's love for his wife is evident throughout his catalog - from 2020's ""All Around Me"" to 2021's ""Hailey."" But in case anyone is still skeptical (they are), Bieber sets the record straight on ""Swag."" On album standout ""Walking Away,"" Bieber gets candid about his relationship troubles but also reaffirms that he's committed to his marriage. ""You were my diamond / Gave you a ring / I made you a promise / I told you I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away,"" he sings.

mov_5CF5282B7BDC672CB29FDDA77613FF3D,"  Is it finally clocking to you? Justin Bieber is back. The 31-year-old singer surprise-released a new album, “Swag,” Friday after teasing fans the previous morning with a series of billboards and social media posts. Bieber's first album since 2021's “Justice,” the new music prompted an online frenzy and revived a devoted community of Beliebers. From his marriage to his paparazzi encounters, Bieber has faced incredible scrutiny over the last few months, which he addresses head-on in “Swag.” After listening to all 21 tracks, here are our biggest takeaways. R&Bieber is back Table of Contents Bieber has incorporated R&B elements in his music since early in his career and embraced the genre fully on the 2013 compilation album “Journals.” But even after coining R&Bieber in 2019, he's struggled to be taken seriously. When 2020's “Changes” received a Grammy nomination for pop vocal album, Bieber expressed his confusion at not being nominated in the R&B category. “To the Grammys I am flattered to be acknowledged and appreciated for my artistry. I am very meticulous and intentional about my music. With that being said I set out to make an R&B album. ' Changes' was and is an R&B album,” he wrote on Instagram. “It is not being acknowledged as an R&B album which is very strange to me. I grew up admiring R&B music and wished to make a project that would embody that sound.” “To be clear I absolutely love Pop music,” he added. “It just wasn't what I set out to make this time around. My gratitude for feeling respected for my work remains and I am honored to be nominated either way.” On “Swag,” Bieber shows off his R&B chops. From opening track “All I Can Take” and the seemingly SZA-inspired “Yukon” to “Daisies” (which reportedly features Mk.gee on the guitar), he takes a more intimate approach than on previous albums. But still, longtime fans will hear hints of “Journals” and “Changes” throughout the project. In one of the album's unconventional moments, comedian Druski comments on Bieber's more “soulful,” R&B-infused sound. “I said this album kinda sound, you got some soul on this album too, bro,” he says on the interlude track “Soulful.” “Your skin white but your soul Black, Justin. I promise you, man.” He's not 'Walking Away' from his marriage Since Justin and Hailey Bieber wed in 2018, their marriage has been under a microscope. Divorce rumors circulated within months of them tying the knot, and it didn't help that many fans were still rooting for the singer to get back with ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. Bieber's love for his wife is evident throughout his catalog — from 2020's “All Around Me” to 2021's “Hailey.” But in case anyone is still skeptical (they are), Bieber sets the record straight on “Swag.” On album standout “Walking Away,” Bieber gets candid about his relationship troubles but also reaffirms that he's committed to his marriage. “You were my diamond / Gave you a ring / I made you a promise / I told you I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away,” he sings. Elsewhere on the album, he cheers on his wife. On “Go Baby” (which lyrically echoes 2021's “There She Go”), he sings, “That's my baby, she's iconic, iPhone case, lip gloss on it” — a reference to the Rhode founder's famous lip gloss-holder phone case.

mov_CBF88DB5433CA59566B26443100647CD,"  Justin Bieber has reportedly settled with Scooter Braun, his former manager, for $31.5 million over their financial dispute regarding the pop star's canceled ""Justice Tour"" and alleged unpaid commissions. This news came amid the release of the pop singer's seventh studio album, , on July 11, 2025. On July 10, 2025, TMZ reported that Bieber and Braun reached a $31.5 million settlement regarding their financial dispute. News of Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun reportedly settling their financial dispute was met with mixed reactions from netizens on X, with one user accusing the former manager of robbing Bieber. ""So scooter robbed justin, disgusting, karma is coming."" liv @grandesnasaso scooter robbed justin, disgusting, karma is coming Several netizens agreed with this sentiment, claiming Braun was a ""fake friend"" to Bieber. ""That person should change their name to scooter robber,"" one person tweeted. ""All my homies hate scooter braun,"" another person added. ""That's when you know there are no friends in the music business…Braun always acted like he was Justin's friend and cared for him…but once it affected his pockets all that fake friendship went out the window… and we all saw the medical issues that made Justin cancel the tour,"" someone else commented. ""Scooter deserves no more money after this,"" another user said. Others speculated whether the pop star's wife, Hailey Bieber, was instrumental in settling the debt. For context, Hailey sold her beauty brand, Rhode, to e.l.f Beauty for $1 billion in late May 2025. ""Hailey helped him pay the debt by selling her company,"" one person speculated. ""I bet that was Hailey's Rhode money,"" another person added. ""That rhode money is gonna last nothing at this point,"" someone else commented. ""Hence the lovely posts with wifey! Women always save the day smh,"" another user wrote. Exploring Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun's financial dispute The financial dispute between Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun began in 2022, while the singer was on his ""Justice Tour"" to promote his sixth studio album. For the uninitiated, Bieber reportedly received a $40 million advance from Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), which is Live Nation's parent company, for his ""Justice Tour"" in 2022. However, the singer canceled most of the tour in 2023 due to a health condition (he was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome) and was asked to pay back $26 million of the advance to AEG. According to TMZ, Scooter Braun, who was Bieber's manager at the time, shouldered the payment through his company Hybe, with the pop star promising to pay Hybe and Braun back in installments over the next 10 years. Justin Bieber reportedly paid just one installment and stopped. However, recent reports indicate that Bieber and Braun have settled the payment, which also included an additional clause requiring Bieber to pay half of the $11 million that he allegedly owed Braun in unpaid commissions, bringing the total to $31.5 million. As per the TMZ report, this does not include the additional $8.6 million that Bieber allegedly owed Braun in further unpaid commissions, which the former manager waived. There have been multiple reports of Justin Bieber's alleged financial struggles, which many believe contributed to the singer selling his 291-song catalogue to Hipgnosis Songs Capital in December 2022 for $200 million. A TMZ documentary released in May 2025, titled alleged that the singer “had to sell his music catalog because he was broke.” “I was on a call with multiple people — Justin's side acknowledges that in 2022, he was on the verge of… the words were 'financial collapse.' And that's why he had to sell his catalog,” TMZ executive producer Levin says in the documentary. However, Justin Bieber has denied all rumors of his alleged financial troubles, with his representative telling The Hollywood Reporter in April 2025: “Any source that is trying to sell you a story about alleged financial distress … either doesn't understand the entertainment industry or, more likely, is trying to paint an unflattering portrait of Justin, which bears no resemblance to reality.” As per Celebrity Net Worth, Justin Bieber's net worth is reportedly $200 million as of July 2025. In other news, Justin Bieber surprised fans after he released his new album, , on July 11 with minimal promotion. The 21-track album reportedly features artists like Cash Cobain, Gunna, and Druski.

A screen-cleaning brush for anyone who struggles to see out of their windows because of grime-covered mesh screens. Is that a twig or a crack in the glass? Maybe there's a dead bug clinging to the outside of the screen, and he's been there for so long that you've named him. (Everyone say hello to Carl!) Promising review: ""Our screens are on a second-floor balcony. There really isn't any good way to clean the outside of the screens. Luckily, the fibers on this screen cleaner are small enough that they seem to fit through the screen and clean both sides. I'm sure it doesn't clean the outside as well as it does the inside, but any help is always appreciated. I was actually shocked at how much dirt came off of the screens with this very simple tool. I used it wet with a small amount of dish soap, and it worked really well. I also appreciated that after I was finished I was just easily able to rinse and dry the screen cleaner for future use. A simple tool at an excellent price."" —BonjourBeautyByAmy Get it from Amazon for $17.09. 2. A slicker brush if your fave fleece blanket or rug started out so cozy and plush, but now the once-fluffy fabric is clumpy, matted, and not so soft. This genius brush is designed to restore cashmere, faux fur, sheepskin, wool, and more so it feels (and looks!) new again. Promising review: ""Where have these been all my life? We purchased a couple of beautiful charcoal-gray (dyed) sheepskin rugs for both sides of our bed. It used to feel really nice to get out of bed and set your feet on them. But after many years and a couple of dogs, my reaction to putting my feet down is, 'Ew. What the heck did I just step on?' Because of the dye, we can't just wash them or get them too wet. And I'm kind of lazy and forgetful. (Meaning, I've been thinking of taking them to a dry cleaner for years — but how much will that cost?) After our puppy had an accident (the worst kind of accident) on one, I knew I had to do something. These rugs weren't cheap, so tossing them wasn't an option. I cleaned up the 'accident' as best I could, but that left the spot feeling kind of dry and crunchy. So, after reading and googling, I decided to try one of these wire wool brushes. HALLELUJAH! It took some muscle to thoroughly brush each rug, but wow, not only did it re-fluff and revive the wool, but it also pulled up a lot of loose dirt and anything that was stuck to the fibers. I really wish I had gotten this brush sooner!"" —Renee Get it from Amazon for $17.99. 3. A collagen-coating hair treatment so you can give your dry, damaged, and overprocessed strands the TLC they need. This reparative five-minute hair mask will revive your mane and leave it soft, silky, and smooth. Promising review: ""My hair used to be really soft, and then I discovered hot tools and hair dye. While my hair looks good, I really missed the soft texture. This works so well. There are no instructions on the box, but I washed my hair with my usual shampoo, towel dried it, worked about two quarter-sized dollops through my hair, let it sit for 20 minutes, and then rinsed out. I went to bed with wet hair, which usually results in my hair being kind of tangled and rough-looking, but I woke up and my hair was as soft and silky as it was before I started coloring it. I'm totally in love with this product. I have long, fine hair, but this doesn't leave it greasy or weigh it down.

Jurassic World: Rebirth stayed strong in its second weekend, but all eyes are on the upcoming Fantastic Four: First Steps, as Marvel gears up for a major summer showdown. Streaming momentum showed no signs of slowing: – Squid Game became Netflix's third most-watched show of all time—just two weeks in – The Old Guard 2 dominated Netflix's global film rankings in over 70 countries – Sinners became the #1 movie on Max in nearly 50 countries – Heads of State topped Prime Video, powered by star power and global marketing – K-Pop: Demon Hunters proved it's more than a movie, with three tracks in Spotify's global Top 10 and the most-streamed album in the world. Transmedia synergy in full effect. On YouTube Shorts, AI-generated content continues to lead, while KIMPRO and MrBeast remain top performers. Live sports, K-Pop music videos, and Bollywood trailers drove long-form viewership. Star buzz is heating up: – Kerry Condon is breaking out in F1: The Movie – Charlize Theron is front and center with The Old Guard 2, Apex, and her next project with Christopher Nolan – Scarlett Johansson is everywhere—from Jurassic World to Prime Day skincare deals to her directorial debut Brand and fan culture came to life this week: Chuck E.

A heat-activated anti-frizz treatment sure to be a total game changer for people who straighten or blow dry their hair straight only for it to go *poof* when they step outside. This humidity-fighting formula ""waterproofs"" your hair to help protect it from 'do-ruining weather. Promising review: This product is incredible — just WOW. In all my years of existence, I was never able to tame my naturally curly hair into a sleek, silky, frizz-free look, until now.

I'm in my '60s, and my hair was dry and dull because of my medications. I just hated my hair. I bought this not expecting too much, but was I wrong!!!!

So I had to find something to make the stench go away without leaving me with an allergic reaction. Mini Moso was the answer. I honestly couldn't believe it. A few days after placing them in my prized off shoes, I took a whiff from about a foot away. Nothing. I got closer. Nothing. I stuck my nose practically in the shoe.
