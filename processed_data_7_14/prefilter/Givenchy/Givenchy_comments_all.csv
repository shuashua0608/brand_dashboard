1lpdp44,"  I'm one of those people who goes full tunnel vision whenever a new hobby catches my eye. I've flirted with coin collecting, dipped my toes into sneakers, and gotten somewhat into watches (budget's not allowing me to get too deep into this one). But for the past year, it's been all about fragrances—and honestly, aside from watches, this one's been the most fun. I've always had a soft spot for good scents. As a kid, my options were limited to budget bangers like Fogg and Axe. Occasionally, I'd sneak a few sprays from my dad's One Man Show by Jacques Bogart—which, in Bangladesh, was THE dad scent and I still enjoyed it. During my high school and college days, my dad gifted me a few designer fragrances—CK One, CH Men, Givenchy Gentlemen Only Absolute, Boss Bottled EDT, Emporio Armani… lui. I held onto each of them dearly—not just because they were gifts, but because they're what lit the spark. At the time, dropping more than $50 on a fragrance felt like a full-blown luxury. Even a year ago, I'd hesitate before going over $100. But post-graduation, once I landed a job, I figured—why not treat myself? I dove into YouTube reviews, fell hard for the Middle Eastern fragrance hype, and picked up 9PM, Hawas, Khamrah, Bade al Oud the usual suspects. Had a blast with them. Then I ventured into more mainstream designer stuff—Eros, Rabanne Victory Extreme… but they didn't hit like I hoped. That's when I started craving something different—something I hadn't smelled on every guy in a party or hangout . I slowly unfollowed the “Top 10 panty droppers” crowd and moved away from the hype-chasing echo chamber. I began doing my own research, dug into deeper reviews, curbed the blind buys, and started really learning. These days, I enjoy watching folks like Daniel from Seldomly Often, Sebastian from The Perfume Guy, Marcelo from The Niche Fragrance Collector, Justin from The Stay Fresh Production, and Alavi from Persolaise. No fluff, just passion and perspective. What's been especially refreshing is how welcoming the local fragrance community is. Compared to some hobbies that can get a bit… elitist, this one feels more open. Sure, some fragheads can be snobbish too, but I've had pretty smooth sailing so far. So here we are—a year and a month into this olfactory rabbit hole, and I'm loving every step. The failed blind buys, the hype traps, the unexpected gems—it's all part of the ride. I've sold off a few misses, gifted a couple to my brother and dad, and what's left are the ones I actually reach for and enjoy. There are still a few bottles I've got my eye on—ones that feel like missing pieces of my current collection. Once I grab those, I'll probably hit pause for a bit and shift focus to other priorities. Until then, I'll keep enjoying what I've already got on the shelf.","I'm one of those people who goes full tunnel vision whenever a new hobby catches my eye.

mov_526498EC64897596F08DBE3EFC42F22C,"  SPR_COMBO[fr]Depuis 2015, Sam Zirah s'investit pleinement dans la production, la réalisation et la présentation de ses émissions diffusées sur sa chaîne YouTube. D'abord focalisé sur le domaine de la téléréalité, dont il est devenu une référence incontournable et un passage obligé pour les protagonistes, le Montpelliérain s'est récemment diversifié en recevant notamment des politiques. Avec plus de deux millions d'abonnés, ses émissions cumulent chaque semaine des centaines de milliers de vues. Dans « En toute intimité », Sam Zirah prend le temps d'échanger en face-à-face avec ses invités. Des entretiens dans un climat de bienveillance où il ose poser toutes les questions. Son talk-show « Au jour d'aujourd'hui » consacré à l'actualité du monde de la téléréalité, qu'il anime aux côtés d'une équipe de chroniqueurs, est devenu un rendez-vous hebdomadaire attendu et apprécié fort de plus de 200 numéros. Il y a neuf mois, il a lancé « Chez Zirah », un format d'interview consacré aux personnalités sortant de la sphère de la téléréalité. En l'espace de seize numéros, il a notamment reçu Sébastien Delogu, Manon Aubry, Louis Boyard, Sébastien Chenu, Yaël Braun-Pivet, Julien Odoul, Rima Hassan et Arthur Delaporte dans le registre politique ainsi qu'Harry Roselmack pour la partie médias et l'avocate Nadia El Bouroumi. Sam Zirah nous a reçus dans ses locaux parisiens et nous raconte son parcours. » LIRE AUSSI - Lancement de sa chaîne YouTube en 2015 « Une des clés de la réussite d'un projet, c'est l'investissement et surtout la régularité. Au-delà de la motivation et de l'énergie, j'ai commencé avec l'idée de produire une émission par semaine. Ma première invitée était Aurélie Preston, candidate des “Marseillais” . Mon concept d'interview était de m'adresser à des personnalités de téléréalité comme un animateur télé pourrait le faire avec n'importe quelle célébrité : avec curiosité et considération. C'était une époque où la téléréalité était souvent traitée de manière légère et trash. Ce qui a dénoté au début, c'est que je vouvoyais mes interlocuteurs. Je tenais cela de mes années dans le milieu du prêt-à-porter de luxe où le vouvoiement était de rigueur. » Création de sa société 2ZS Production « J'ai commencé en autoentrepreneur jusqu'à ce que mon père me conseille de créer une structure et m'aide à monter ma société en février 2017. Tous les noms qui me plaisaient étaient déjà pris. Comme nous étions le père et le fils dans cette création d'entreprise, c'est devenu 2ZS Production, comme deux Zirah. » Une enfance dans le sud de la France « Je suis né à Montpellier. J'ai une sœur aînée et je suis tonton de deux petites-nièces que j'adore, une qui vient d'avoir 15 ans et une de 4 ans. Mon père est un entrepreneur dans l'âme, je l'ai toujours connu chef d'entreprise. Il a commencé de zéro et a réussi à créer une société très innovante pour l'époque dans la gestion électronique des files d'attente. Aujourd'hui, il a 140 salariés. J'ai toujours été admiratif de son parcours. Il rêvait de faire ce que je fais aujourd'hui mais il ne pouvait pas car il est sourd de naissance . Ma maman a toujours été là pour ma sœur et moi, elle était à la maison pour s'occuper de nous. Elle nous apportait beaucoup d'amour. » Une scolarité difficile « Comme beaucoup de timides et d'introvertis, je voulais faire quelque chose dans la représentation, je voulais être comédien. J'ai eu mon bac L, option arts plastiques, je suis parti à Paris un an après et j'ai fait le cours Florent. À l'école, je devais travailler énormément pour obtenir des résultats très moyens contrairement à ma sœur qui lisait une page deux fois et qui la connaissait par cœur. J'étais épileptique de mes 7 à mes 13 ans. Les neurologues avaient expliqué à ma mère que mon traitement créait des problèmes de concentration et je n'arrivais pas à apprendre mes leçons. C'était très dur pour moi. Je me sentais bête de ne pas réussir à apprendre. » De la comédie au monde de la mode « Je me suis rendu compte que la comédie n'était pas faite pour moi. Cela allait être très difficile parce que j'étais plus efféminé que les autres, j'avais plus de manières sans le faire exprès. J'avais mon accent du sud. Contrairement à d'autres, mon orientation se voyait et c'était difficile de jouer les jeunes premiers quand tu n'es pas crédible. En parallèle, j'ai travaillé dans le prêt-à-porter de luxe, j'aimais bien représenter et cela a plu à l'industrie du luxe. J'ai travaillé dans les cosmétiques chez Sephora, j'ai appris à maquiller sur le tas. Puis j'ai été vendeur chez Givenchy, ça a été extraordinaire. À 23 ans, je suis devenu directeur adjoint de trois boutiques Burberry puis directeur de ma propre boutique pour la marque Chloé. Au bout de quatre mois, j'ai tout stoppé.

D'abord focalisé sur le domaine de la téléréalité, dont il est devenu une référence incontournable et un passage obligé pour les protagonistes, le Montpelliérain s'est récemment diversifié en recevant notamment des politiques. Avec plus de deux millions d'abonnés, ses émissions cumulent chaque semaine des centaines de milliers de vues. Dans « En toute intimité », Sam Zirah prend le temps d'échanger en face-à-face avec ses invités. Des entretiens dans un climat de bienveillance où il ose poser toutes les questions. Son talk-show « Au jour d'aujourd'hui » consacré à l'actualité du monde de la téléréalité, qu'il anime aux côtés d'une équipe de chroniqueurs, est devenu un rendez-vous hebdomadaire attendu et apprécié fort de plus de 200 numéros. Il y a neuf mois, il a lancé « Chez Zirah », un format d'interview consacré aux personnalités sortant de la sphère de la téléréalité. En l'espace de seize numéros, il a notamment reçu Sébastien Delogu, Manon Aubry, Louis Boyard, Sébastien Chenu, Yaël Braun-Pivet, Julien Odoul, Rima Hassan et Arthur Delaporte dans le registre politique ainsi qu'Harry Roselmack pour la partie médias et l'avocate Nadia El Bouroumi. Sam Zirah nous a reçus dans ses locaux parisiens et nous raconte son parcours. » LIRE AUSSI - Lancement de sa chaîne YouTube en 2015 « Une des clés de la réussite d'un projet, c'est l'investissement et surtout la régularité. Au-delà de la motivation et de l'énergie, j'ai commencé avec l'idée de produire une émission par semaine. Ma première invitée était Aurélie Preston, candidate des “Marseillais” . Mon concept d'interview était de m'adresser à des personnalités de téléréalité comme un animateur télé pourrait le faire avec n'importe quelle célébrité : avec curiosité et considération. C'était une époque où la téléréalité était souvent traitée de manière légère et trash. Ce qui a dénoté au début, c'est que je vouvoyais mes interlocuteurs. Je tenais cela de mes années dans le milieu du prêt-à-porter de luxe où le vouvoiement était de rigueur. » Création de sa société 2ZS Production « J'ai commencé en autoentrepreneur jusqu'à ce que mon père me conseille de créer une structure et m'aide à monter ma société en février 2017. Tous les noms qui me plaisaient étaient déjà pris. Comme nous étions le père et le fils dans cette création d'entreprise, c'est devenu 2ZS Production, comme deux Zirah. » Une enfance dans le sud de la France « Je suis né à Montpellier. J'ai une sœur aînée et je suis tonton de deux petites-nièces que j'adore, une qui vient d'avoir 15 ans et une de 4 ans. Mon père est un entrepreneur dans l'âme, je l'ai toujours connu chef d'entreprise. Il a commencé de zéro et a réussi à créer une société très innovante pour l'époque dans la gestion électronique des files d'attente. Aujourd'hui, il a 140 salariés. J'ai toujours été admiratif de son parcours. Il rêvait de faire ce que je fais aujourd'hui mais il ne pouvait pas car il est sourd de naissance . Ma maman a toujours été là pour ma sœur et moi, elle était à la maison pour s'occuper de nous. Elle nous apportait beaucoup d'amour. » Une scolarité difficile « Comme beaucoup de timides et d'introvertis, je voulais faire quelque chose dans la représentation, je voulais être comédien. J'ai eu mon bac L, option arts plastiques, je suis parti à Paris un an après et j'ai fait le cours Florent. À l'école, je devais travailler énormément pour obtenir des résultats très moyens contrairement à ma sœur qui lisait une page deux fois et qui la connaissait par cœur. J'étais épileptique de mes 7 à mes 13 ans. Les neurologues avaient expliqué à ma mère que mon traitement créait des problèmes de concentration et je n'arrivais pas à apprendre mes leçons. C'était très dur pour moi. Je me sentais bête de ne pas réussir à apprendre. » De la comédie au monde de la mode « Je me suis rendu compte que la comédie n'était pas faite pour moi. Cela allait être très difficile parce que j'étais plus efféminé que les autres, j'avais plus de manières sans le faire exprès. J'avais mon accent du sud. Contrairement à d'autres, mon orientation se voyait et c'était difficile de jouer les jeunes premiers quand tu n'es pas crédible. En parallèle, j'ai travaillé dans le prêt-à-porter de luxe, j'aimais bien représenter et cela a plu à l'industrie du luxe. J'ai travaillé dans les cosmétiques chez Sephora, j'ai appris à maquiller sur le tas. Puis j'ai été vendeur chez Givenchy, ça a été extraordinaire. À 23 ans, je suis devenu directeur adjoint de trois boutiques Burberry puis directeur de ma propre boutique pour la marque Chloé. Au bout de quatre mois, j'ai tout stoppé. Ce que je voulais, c'était créer. » Accro aux vidéos « Quand j'étais petit, je fabriquais des sagas de l'été avec la caméra de mon père, je faisais tourner mes meilleurs amis et je les interviewais.

La robe frappante a connu son premier moment de tapis rouge en 2003, lorsque le mannequin brésilien Gisele Bündchen, alors la petite amie de Leonardo DiCaprio, l'a porté au Met Gala.

Contrairement aux pièces vintage, généralement plus de 20 ans, les vêtements d'archives se réfèrent souvent à des pièces de passerelle en édition limitée considérées comme de l'art portable. “Quelque chose de rare de l'histoire de la mode est un autre type de vantardise”, a déclaré Gill Linton, PDG de Byronesque, une plate-forme dédiée à la mode archivistique. “Les vêtements sont des célébrités à part entière, pour rendre les gens plus authentiques qu'ils ne le sont réellement.” Ceretti, qui a ensuite partagé des images de coutures déchirées de la robe délicate Instagramsemblait imperturbable par sa fragilité.

mov_AB28BCB31E9E0514AAFCF92C6D454F1F,"  They say, fashion comes its fair share of faux pas and flair! While luxurious wardrobes and style statements speak for the 'flair' part, the faux pas part most certainly includes the mispronunciations of the well-known fashion brands (despite those being extremely famous). And while these mishaps are quite cliché, they're not chic at all. Because let's be honest – in the world of fashion, half the battle is looking the part, and the rest of it is acing the etiquette (which includes the correct pronunciation of popular fashion brands). Mispronouncing a luxury label can cost you credibility faster than you can say “Céline.” Lucky for you, we've done the hard work. From Parisian labels to Italian icons and streetwear staples, this guide is sprinkled with phonetic line-drawing, brand backstories, and quirky insider tips to help you glide through any style conversation with ease. So, say goodbye to awkward pauses and hello to stylish confidence – let's break it down, brand by brand. French elegance: Subtle, chic, and tricky Hermès – Not “Her-meez,” but gentle vowel start, silent 'H' and 's': “air‑MEZ” or “er‑MEZ”, not “her‑meez.” Givenchy – Often butchered as “Gah‑vin‑chee.” The correct French flourish? “zhee‑VOHN‑shee”, with soft 'G', nasal 'on', and a gentle final “‑shee.” Chanel – Forget “Shan‑elle.” The proper style? “SHUH‑nel.” Chic, crisp, simple, and oh-so‑Parisian. Balmain – Yes, it's not “BAL‑mayn.” Roll it out like “bal‑MAH”, trailing off the 'n' softly for that French flair. Yves Saint Laurent – Drop those hard Ts! The smooth version: “EEV san‑loh‑rah(n)”, a lovers' lane nasal finish. Christian Louboutin – Strut smoothly: “kris‑tee‑ahn loo‑boo‑TAHN”, not “tin.” Christian Lacroix – “LA-kwa.” So “kris‑tee‑ahn luh‑kwa”, rolling that l–r combo beautifully. Comme des Garçons – Play it subtly: “comb‑DAY gar‑SON”, letting the 's' fade, nasal 'on' intact. Italian icons: Bold, bright, and vowely Gucci – It's “GOO‑chee”, emphasis on the first syllable, never “Goo‑kee.” Versace – Despite the trendy slip, it's properly “ver‑SAH‑cheh.” Donatella herself has piped up to confirm it. Prada – Simple and sweet: “PRAH‑dah”, sturdy first syllable, light second. Moschino – The fun-filled style comes through in “mos‑KEY‑no”, not “mos‑chee‑no.” Bottega Veneta – Soft and elegant: “boh‑TEH‑gah veh‑NEH‑ta”, a solid roll in every segment. Dolce & Gabbana – Smooth Italian gloss: “DOL‑chay eh ga‑BAN‑eh”, not “Gab‑anna.” Spanish flair and subtle sound Balenciaga – Spanish royalty. Break it into “bah‑LEN‑see‑AH‑gah,” emphasizing the “AH” and smoothing past the “cia.” Loewe – Spanish elegance meets German twist: say “lo‑WEH‑vay”, not “low‑eeve.” Athleisure staples Adidas – A German classic: “AH‑dee‑dahs”, emphasis on the first syllable, founder Adi Dassler's namesake. Nike – Named after the Greek goddess, it's “NY‑kee”, not “Nighk.” Porsche – Elegant German soap-opera: “POR‑shuh”, with a soft “‑uh” ending. Cross-cultural gems Bvlgari (Latin-script brand) – Pronounce “BOOL‑gah‑ree,” highlighting the “u” after “B.” Cartier – Soft, refined: “kar‑tee‑AY”, not “Car‑tee‑er.” Jacquemus – From French fashion forward: “ZHAK‑moose.” Celine – A blend of syllables: “seh‑LEEN,” soft start, piercing end. Nailing the correct pronunciation of a fashion might seem like a superficial conquest – but it isn't just about speaking the name; it's about stepping into the essence of each brand. Elevating your fashion conversations goes beyond clothes – it's about knowing the names and pronouncing them with confidence, creativity, and cultural awareness. From the sonorous softness of French designers to the vibrant clarity of Italian labels, each namescape tells a story – learn the sound, share the style. With this guide, you're not just knocking it out of the vocabulary park; you're stepping onto the stylistic stage with poise and pizzazz....","They say, fashion comes its fair share of faux pas and flair!

644585D332B4330B4F22FA250AE5663D,"  And what's in it for the brands? As the industry's model for working with public figures shifts, the power dynamics are becoming increasingly unclear. On Friday in Paris, the Northern Irish designer Jonathan Anderson will show his first collection as the creative director of the French fashion house Dior. During his previous, 11-year tenure as the creative director of the Spanish brand Loewe, Anderson became known for his avant-garde sensibility and dedication to craft -- but also for his unique ability to turn the internet's so-called boyfriends (those young actors and musicians who are lusted over online with possessive familiarity) into bona fide celebrities. In the front row of Anderson's fall 2024 Loewe men's wear show in Paris were the established actors Jamie Dornan, Andrew Garfield and Nicholas Hoult, but also, seated with equal prominence, emerging ones, including Drew Starkey, who was set to star in ''Queer'' (the 2024 Luca Guadagnino movie for which Anderson oversaw the costumes), and Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist, who would soon appear as romantic leads in Guadagnino's film ''Challengers,'' a film that helped them reach mainstream heartthrob status, and with which Anderson was also involved as a costume designer. The following June, at Anderson's final Loewe men's runway show, the rising actors Kit Connor, Evan Peters and Enzo Vogrincic sat front row -- suggesting, based on the strength of the designer's track record, that they too would also soon become leading men. For Loewe, it was a display of cultural currency; for the actors, it was free publicity. It used to be that an association with a brand was, if not a career-killer, then certainly not chic for an actor. It was hard to be taken seriously as both an artist and a de facto fashion model. But in recent decades, the rise of social media and the expansion of the fashion industry have blurred the lines between model, actor and influencer. Back in the 1980s, the Italian fashion house Armani began dressing Hollywood celebrities, including, most notably, Richard Gere for his role in the 1980 movie ''American Gigolo.'' But gone are the days when one megastar served as a company's global face. Today brands adopt a multitiered system of ambassadors that includes international stars, yes, but also up-and-comers and influencers. While these cliques are often described by their members and parent brands as ''family,'' and frequently represent a genuine affinity, they are also carefully constructed to maximize a company's exposure on red carpets and billboards -- but also very specific corners of TikTok. Now, as this business decision solidifies into standard practice, the question is, Who ultimately wields the power, the celebrities or the brands? Until 2010, ''a few brands had ambassadors, but it was mainly for fragrance,'' says Ben Cercio, the founder of a consulting agency specializing in brand strategy and communications with clients including the French fashion house Givenchy. But with the launch of Instagram that year, a shift occurred: companies began to engage not just with major actors but also with ''microinfluencers'' -- online personalities with less than 100,000 followers -- to reach their audiences early on. And because social media has accelerated the rise to fame, whenever a new talent in any field emerges from the crowd, ''every brand wants to get its hands on them,'' says Cercio. Now an ingénue like the actress Mikey Madison, who starred in last year's ''Anora,'' might have a dozen offers from brands immediately after making a buzzy debut at a festival like Cannes, suggesting that it's often the young actors, rather than the brands, who are in control. When Madison accepted her Oscar for best lead actress in March, she wore a custom look from Dior. Cercio adds that while relationships once developed organically -- a talent would come to a fashion show, be given some pieces and maybe wear something from the latest collection on the red carpet -- increasingly, ''money is very quickly involved.'' Indeed, an ambassadorship is now a coveted deal among celebrities of all tiers. '' There's enough proof in the market of just how great a partnership can look,'' says George Georgopoulos, the director of brand partnerships at Huxley, an agency that represents artists including Charli XCX. After releasing her globally successful album ''Brat,'' last summer, the pop star partnered with companies from H&M to Acne Studios and performed with a seemingly empty Gucci bag on ''Saturday Night Live'' in what appeared to be a wink-wink placement. (She'd headlined the brand's annual LACMA Gala a few weeks before.) Getting a check for simply holding an object, she seemed to imply, was not selling out but making the system work for her. For many celebrities, ''there's more money in the ambassadorship than in a lot of the payments they receive for their work onscreen,'' says the writer and pop culture podcaster Evan Ross Katz. Those funds can free up major actors to pursue less commercial projects, like indie films and plays; they are also increasingly essential for younger performers who aren't yet earning large sums for their creative work. Depending on their level of fame, a celebrity can make anywhere from $50,000 to many millions of dollars with endorsement deals, according to several people who work on confidential contracts. On the lower end are social media posts: An artist with a significant following could be paid $100,000 to $150,000 for a single main-grid post holding a product and tagging a brand. If their following is in the multiple millions, however, these numbers can reach seven figures, one stylist said. Slightly more lucrative are red-carpet appearances. And on the higher end are elaborate contracts that require more than just showing up at Fashion Week twice a year. A deal worth around $3 million, for example, could involve appearing in advertising campaigns, attending events like store openings, being dressed for the red carpet, wearing the brand out more casually for paparazzi shots and creating several social media posts. The prestige of an endorsement deal can also boost the cachet of a relatively unknown artist or internet personality immeasurably. Katz cites the YouTuber Emma Chamberlain and the pop star Addison Rae as two recent examples of social media stars whose fame has grown well beyond their original audience, partly because of their fashion partnerships. Since 2019, Chamberlain has been an ambassador for Louis Vuitton; last year, Rae appeared in a campaign film for Saint Laurent. Likewise, while celebrity ambassadors might not necessarily move units for brands in the short term -- unless they have the influence of a Kardashian or a Hadid -- they give companies exposure to niche but devoted audiences. By putting the actor Jeremy Allen White on a billboard, for example, Calvin Klein helped transform a nascent sex symbol into the kind of established idol the brand more typically casts -- and it got to be a part of the cultural conversation following the success of White's show ''The Bear.'' And when, last summer, Marc Jacobs recruited the viral TikTok chef Nara Smith to ''make'' one of the brand's tote bags from baking ingredients in a tongue-in-cheek video, Smith gained fashion credibility, while the brand got to create a social media moment of its own. Both parties signaled that they were in on the joke. But not all relationships are the right match. '' I remember this desire for fashion to lead the conversation and not follow it,'' says Katz. '' Part of me worries that that's beginning to shift.'' Still, brands are continuing to experiment with new models...","And what's in it for the brands?

VOGUE verrät, wie sie jetzt kombiniert werden. Diese 5 Schuhe aus den 80ern liegen jetzt wieder im Trend! Die Mode der 80er-Jahre ist schwer zu vergessen – die Schulterpolster zum Beispiel oder die knalligen Farben. Aber auch die ausgefallenen Schuhe aus dem vergangenen Jahrzehnt sind legendär und werden im Sommer 2025 wieder rauf und runter getragen – darunter Ballerinas, Slingbacks oder zweifarbige Pumps. VOGUE verrät, welche Modelle zurück auf dem Laufsteg – und der Straße – sind und wie sie heute kombiniert werden. 5 Modelle aus den 80ern, die im Sommer 2025 wieder angesagt sind #1 Ballerinas In den 30er-Jahren lancierten Designer:innen wie Christian Dior, Elsa Schiaparelli und Yves Saint Laurent die ersten Ballerinas, die nicht nur für ihre Eleganz, sondern auch für ihren Komfort gefeiert wurden. Später dann, in den 80er-Jahren, war auch Prinzessin Diana ein großer Fan der Silhouette; während Kate Moss und Alexa Chung in den späten 2000er- und frühen 2010er-Jahren zu den Anhängerinnen gehörten. Perry Ellis stellte 1987 ein schlichtes weißes Modell vor, das sie gepaart mit einem weißen, geradlinigen Look über den Laufsteg schickte. Nachdem die Modelle dann einige Jahre von der Bildfläche verschwunden waren, bahnten sie sich in den letzten Saisons ihren Weg zurück an die Spitze. Während in den 80er-Jahren aber vorrangig klassische Designs im Vordergrund standen, zeigen sich die Ballerinas heute verspielter – zum Beispiel aus Mesh oder PVC, mit Leoparden- oder Reptilmuster. Bei Chloé präsentierte Chemena Kamali beispielsweise eine geschnürte Boho-Version der Schuhe, die sie zu einem fließenden roséfarbenen Set kombinierte. #2 Slingbacks Apropos elegante Schuhe: Slingback-Modelle, also jene mit Riemchen um die Ferse, gehörten in den 80er-Jahren zur Arbeitsuniform der Frauen. 1987, als das sogenannte Power-Dressing in vollem Gange war, brauchte man ein Design, das bequem, aber dennoch formell war. So wählte Giorgio Armani für seine Kollektion im besagten Jahr Slingbacks, die er zu einer Bundfaltenhose, einer Bluse und einem Blazer mit breiten Schulterpolstern kombinierte. In 2025 kommen Slingbacks besonders gerne mit Kitten Heels daher – wie Marken wie Jacquemus, Contessa Mills und Tamara Ralph bestätigen. Letztere setzte auf eine schwarze Variante der Slingbacks und kombinierte sie mit einer samtigen Off-Shoulder-Bluse und einem Midirock mit Perlenverzierung. #3 T-Steg-Sandalen Sich von vergangenen Jahrzehnten inspirieren zu lassen, ist kein neues Konzept. Und während die Mode der 80er-Jahre der Welt eine Mischung aus Opulenz, Sinnlichkeit und Dramatik bescherte, brachte sie auch viele Elemente der 20er-Jahre zurück – wie lange Halsketten und T-Steg-Sandalen. Givenchy stellte in 1988 beispielsweise ein mit Polka Dots verziertes Modell vor – in Kombination mit einem trägerlosen Kleid im gleichen Muster. Es gab eine Zeit, in der Schuhe mit T-Steg als altmodisch galten. Jetzt, im Sommer 2025, finden die geschichtsträchtigen und mühelos eleganten Schuhe wieder Anklang. Christopher Esber, eine Marke mit australischen Wurzeln, verlieh ihnen mit einer Mesh-Variante und gestylt zum minimalistischen Ensemble aus einem weißen Neckholdertop und einer schwarzen Stoffhose einen modernen Dreh. #4 Oxford-Schuhe In den späten 80er-Jahren begann sich langsam der Minimalismus, der die nächsten Jahre prägen sollte, zu etablieren. Ein Stil, der sich durch androgyne Accessoires – wie zum Beispiel die Oxford-Schuhe – bemerkbar machte. Ralph Lauren hatte sie 1985 bereits mit Absatz vorgestellt; Helmut Lang und Yohji Yamamoto verwischten die Geschlechtergrenzen dann mit Versionen, die fast identisch zu den Herrenschuhen waren. Lang kombinierte sie mit einem langärmeligen Rollkragenkleid, Yamamoto mit einer weißen Oversize-Weste und einem blauen Satinrock. Oxford-Schuhe zogen sich wie ein roter Faden durch die Frühjahr/Sommer-Kollektion 2025 von Loewe. Anstatt sie wie damals zu ebenso androgynen Looks zu stylen, sorgte Jonathan Anderson für einen Stilbruch und kombinierte sie zu romantisch-verspielten Blumen- und Babydoll-Kleidern. #5 Zweifarbige Pumps Das Chanel der 80er-Jahre verkörperte einen Luxus, der sich durch Tweed-Sets, Perlenschmuck – und zweifarbige Pumps auszeichnete. Gründerin Coco Chanel trug oft selbst ein Paar mit niedrigem Absatz. 1982 (ein Jahr bevor Karl Lagerfeld zum französischen Modehaus stieß) sah man zweifarbige Pumps in Kombination mit einem weißen Kleid, einem schwarzen Blazer, Handschuhen, Gürteln und langen Perlenketten auf dem Laufsteg. Während diese klassischen schwarz-cremefarbenen Pumps weiterhin bei Chanel zu sehen sind, gibt es Häuser wie Nina Ricci oder Balmain, die die zweifarbigen Modelle ausgefallener – aber immer noch im gleichen Stil – interpretieren. Balmain setzte für den Sommer 2025 beispielsweise auf eine rot-goldene Version, gepaart mit einem Tweed-Minirock und einer passenden Jacke.","SPR_COMBO[de]Ob zweifarbige Pumps oder T-Steg-Sandalen: Einige Schuhe aus den 80er-Jahren erleben in 2025 ein Comeback.

UgwBOtGCnvh9_iYFOAl4AaABAg,"  The story (allegedly) at one point was that Harry was having doubts even after the engagement, and MM announced she was pregnant which is why the wedding was pushed ahead of Eugenie's wedding. My understanding is that Eugenie and Jack were meant to be getting married before H and M… Allegedly she left that room in her ill fitting dress in case there was a bump but unfortunately by the wedding there was no longer a baby, and even though she could have had the dress adjusted, I have no doubt she would have left it there to mess with H's head. Who would leave that amount of fabric on the stomach area of a Givenchy wedding gown? It just doesn't make sense unless there was an ulterior motive for leaving it there. There are no lengths she wouldn't go to, to get her place on the world wide stage. This all sort of makes sense to me, and would certainly be a reason for her not wanting to share details with Queen Elizabeth. I don't think it was a known thing that she was pregnant, I mean by the family, but I can imagine she made Harry put a rush on the wedding. Has anyone else heard this version of events? What infuriates me is that £32 million 'spectacle' was unnecessary as they had been told  y the Queen that they could have a discreet wedding anywhere they wanted, and that the big Royal wedding wasn't  necessary if they didn't want one.","The story (allegedly) at one point was that Harry was having doubts even after the engagement, and MM announced she was pregnant which is why the wedding was pushed ahead of Eugenie's wedding.

mov_85B88F3879C3CC38867E972D4AA36CAD,"  Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride. While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb - without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries, working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand - one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow, or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets it as a gown, be happy. One would be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires, but it has only two global consumer brands. Having a large home market - by volume, not value - our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts - a net $90 bn deficit. It doesn't help that India's GI regulation is the weakest form of 'sui-generis protection mechanism', as Akriti and Pinaki Ghosh wrote in 2024 in 'Challenges in the Utilization of GI Registration for Capitalizing GI Products', in Journal of Intellectual Property Rights. Lack of enforceability dilutes 'transparency, fairness, effectiveness, and accountability - pillars of good governance', they argue. Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous statutory drafting, sloppy marketing and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations to spur the ages- old artisanship and economically uplift kolhapuri makers. None of the large Indian business groups - those even in fashion or retail - have come forward yet to safeguard their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled sarees as part of a sustainability project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration of iconic monuments and archaeological sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship. From sarees to shoes, music to movies, we hardly prize our handlooms or history, artisans or antiquities. We do not appreciate our own, till the world appreciates it. Oddly enough, while we seek outside validation, we also get easily enraged. Satyajit Ray was 'extremely discouraged' by the initial reception of Pather Panchali in India, Kolkata included. International acclaim, starting with Best Human Document Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, turned the tide. It took America-born Sally Holkar to revive Maheshwari weaves, or John Bissell to create a brand for our fabrics in Fabindia. Delhi-based Scot William Dalrymple has taken India's primordial gift for myth and narrative to make scholarship in history accessible.

mov_DD5460C3F6890BB8502192BE529181DA,  SPR_COMBO[fa]به گزارش خبرنگار اقتصادی خبرگزاری تسنیم؛ صنعت نساجی ایران، با وجود تمام چالش‌های محیطی و سیاسی، از جمله تحریم‌های بین‌المللی، دارای ظرفیت‌های فراوان و مزیت‌های نسبی منحصر به فردی است که کمتر به آن توجه شده است. این ظرفیت‌ها که از منابع طبیعی، نیروی انسانی خلاق و بازار مصرف داخلی نشأت می‌گیرد، همراه با توانمندی‌های فناورانه و ابتکارات نوآورانه، زمینه‌ساز رشد و توسعه پایدار در این صنعت می‌باشد. نگاه به بیرون و انتظار رفع تحریم‌ها یا مذاکرات بین‌المللی هرگز نباید نقطه اتکا و راه‌حل اصلی توسعه صنعت نساجی ایران باشد. بلکه باید با اتکا به دارایی‌های خود و استفاده هوشمندانه از فرصت‌های بومی و جهانی، مسیری مستقل و مقتدرانه برای پیشرفت این صنعت طراحی کنیم.  در این مقاله با مرور 40 ظرفیت کلیدی ایران و 27 ابتکار عمل در صنعت نساجی در سطح جهانی، چارچوبی عملیاتی و مبتنی بر واقعیت‌های کشور ارائه شده که می‌تواند ایران را از بند محدودیت‌ها رها ساخته و به جایگاه واقعی خود در بازارهای جهانی برساند. در همین زمینه بیشتر بخوانید الف) 28 تجربه جهانی در صنعت پوشاک و نساجی 1. انگلستان – آغاز صنعتی‌سازی با صنعت نساجی در انقلاب صنعتی قرن 18 انگلستان نخستین کشوری بود که در اواخر قرن 18 با بهره‌گیری از ماشین بخار و سازماندهی کارخانه‌ای، صنعت نساجی را به نقطه آغاز انقلاب صنعتی تبدیل کرد. توسعه ماشین‌های بافندگی، پیدایش کارخانه‌های متمرکز در منچستر و لیدز، و بهره‌برداری از استعمار هند به‌عنوان منبع پنبه خام، این کشور را در قرن 19 به قطب بی‌بدیل تولید پارچه بدل کرد. دولت بریتانیا با حفاظت از نوآوری‌های تکنولوژیک (مانند ماشین اسپینینگ جنی) و ممنوعیت صادرات ابزار تولید تا مدت‌ها از سلطه خود دفاع کرد. تجربه بریتانیا نشان می‌دهد که نساجی می‌تواند پیشران توسعه صنعتی و آغازگر زنجیره‌های بزرگ اشتغال باشد. 2. هند – احیای صنعت نساجی در قرن بیست و یکم با تمرکز بر پنبه و صادرات هند در سال‌های اخیر با صادرات بیش از 40 میلیارد دلار پوشاک و پارچه، به یکی از غول‌های جهانی در صنعت نساجی تبدیل شده است. این کشور با بهره‌گیری از پنبه داخلی، نیروی کار ارزان، و سیاست‌های حمایتی از زنجیره تولید، به‌ویژه در ایالت‌هایی مانند تامیل‌نادو، گجرات و ماهاراشترا، توانسته است مزیت مقیاس را تثبیت کند. نهادهایی مانند وزارت نساجی هند با ارائه یارانه صادرات، تسهیل‌گری در تأسیس پارک‌های صنعتی و ایجاد زنجیره‌های خوشه‌ای، این صنعت را به یکی از پایه‌های توسعه منطقه‌ای تبدیل کرده‌اند. هند همچنین با توسعه برندهای داخلی مانند FabIndia، در پی ارتقاء ارزش افزوده و طراحی بومی است. 3. ترکیه – توسعه صنعت پوشاک با تمرکز بر صادرات و برندهای بومی ترکیه در دو دهه گذشته با تمرکز بر صادرات به اروپا، برندهای موفقی مانند LC Waikiki، Koton و Mavi را در بازارهای بین‌المللی تثبیت کرده است. سیاست‌های ترکیه در دهه 1990 شامل آزادسازی کنترل دولتی، خصوصی‌سازی صنایع نساجی و تأسیس مناطق آزاد بود. استان‌هایی مانند دنیزلی، بورسا، و قاضی‌انتپ به مراکز تخصصی تولید پارچه و پوشاک بدل شدند. ترکیه همچنین زنجیره کامل از نخ‌ریسی تا طراحی مد و بازاریابی بین‌المللی را توسعه داد. تجربیات این کشور نشان می‌دهد که پیوند میان صنعت، صادرات، طراحی و برندینگ می‌تواند صنعت پوشاک را از خام‌فروشی به قدرت‌آفرینی اقتصادی برساند. 4. بنگلادش – ظهور به‌عنوان دومین صادرکننده پوشاک جهان با نیروی کار ارزان و سیاست تشویقی بنگلادش با صادرات بیش از 38 میلیارد دلار پوشاک در سال 2022، پس از چین دومین صادرکننده پوشاک دنیاست. نقطه قوت این کشور، نیروی کار بسیار ارزان و نظام مالیاتی و تجاری خاص مناطق ویژه صادراتی است. سیاست‌هایی چون معافیت مالیاتی، عدم وجود تعرفه بر واردات مواد اولیه، و حمایت از تأسیس کارخانه‌های کوچک و متوسط، باعث شده بیش از 4000 کارخانه پوشاک در بنگلادش فعال باشند. دولت بنگلادش با حمایت از آموزش زنان در مناطق روستایی و ایجاد زنجیره‌های خانوادگی تولید، از صنعت پوشاک به‌عنوان اهرمی برای توسعه فراگیر استفاده کرده است. 5. چین – ساخت زنجیره‌ کامل نساجی از پنبه‌کاری تا برندینگ جهانی چین از دهه 1980 با سیاست درهای باز، صنعت نساجی را به یکی از پیشران‌های صنعتی خود بدل ساخت. زنجیره تولید در چین، از کشت پنبه در ایالت‌های غربی، تا تولید ماشین‌آلات نساجی، دوخت، طراحی و فروش بین‌المللی گسترده است. مناطق ویژه اقتصادی مانند شنژن و شانگهای میزبان برندهای جهانی و کارخانه‌های بزرگ پوشاک شدند. علاوه بر تولید انبوه، چین با شرکت‌هایی مانند Bosideng یا Peacebird وارد حوزه طراحی و برندینگ جهانی نیز شد. دولت چین همچنین با انعقاد توافق‌های تجارت آزاد در جنوب شرق آسیا، صادرات نساجی را تسهیل کرده است. 6. ایتالیا – تقویت برندهای لوکس با تمرکز بر طراحی، کیفیت و مد پایدار ایتالیا به‌واسطه برندهایی چون Gucci، Prada، Armani و Dolce & Gabbana نماد طراحی فاخر در صنعت پوشاک است. این کشور زنجیره‌ای از کارگاه‌های خانوادگی، طراحان مستقل، دانشگاه‌های مد، و شرکت‌های بافندگی باکیفیت را در شمال ایتالیا – به‌ویژه در منطقه لمباردی – توسعه داده است. دولت با حمایت از صادرات برندهای لوکس، شرکت در نمایشگاه‌های جهانی، و استفاده از ابزار دیپلماسی فرهنگی، صنعت مد را به یک قدرت نرم بدل کرده است. تجربه ایتالیا نشان می‌دهد که تمرکز بر ارزش افزوده، طراحی و تولید محدود، برخلاف تولید انبوه، می‌تواند منجر به موقعیت ممتاز در بازار جهانی شود. 7. ویتنام – استفاده از توافقات تجارت آزاد برای توسعه صنعت پوشاک صادراتی ویتنام با بهره‌گیری از توافقنامه‌های تجارت آزاد با اتحادیه اروپا (EVFTA)، کره‌جنوبی، ژاپن و کشورهای ASEAN، تعرفه‌های صادراتی را کاهش داده و سرمایه‌گذاران خارجی را جذب کرده است. شهرهایی مانند هوشی‌مین و هانوی به مراکز تولید پوشاک برای برندهای بین‌المللی مانند H&M و Zara تبدیل شده‌اند. دولت با تأسیس پارک‌های صنعتی، حمایت از آموزش فنی در مدارس و معافیت مالیاتی برای سرمایه‌گذاری خارجی، رشد سریعی را در صنعت پوشاک رقم زده است....,SPR_COMBO[fa]به گزارش خبرنگار اقتصادی خبرگزاری تسنیم؛ صنعت نساجی ایران، با وجود تمام چالش‌های محیطی و سیاسی، از جمله تحریم‌های

Louis Vuitton、Chanel、Dior、Cartier、Hermès、YSL、Givenchy……
有没有发现，它们几乎都来自——法国‼️
这些品牌，构成了魅力法兰西🇫🇷的标志。 👑 一切从“太阳王”路易十四开始…
法国的奢侈品文化并非偶然，而是从王权时代就被“刻进DNA”。 17世纪，路易十四一边打造凡尔赛宫🌟，一边成立了皇家制造厂，让镜子这种奢侈品开始国产化。 奢侈品从王公贵族的宫廷生活延伸至工艺品、香水、家具🪑与时装👗，奠定了法国“时尚与奢华”的国家品牌。 为什么法国能称霸奢侈品界？ 🧐
这不是偶然，是一场“国家级的精心策划”：
1⃣ 历史文化传承：早在路易十四时代，奢华就已渗透进法国文化
2⃣ 政府全力扶持：法国政府长期为奢侈时尚行业提供资金、打击假货、保护品牌
3⃣ 手工艺精神：传承工坊文化，注重细节与品质
4⃣本地化营销：如在中国市场，会推出中式节日限定款
5⃣ 营造稀缺性：通过限量发售、候补名单营造“买不到”的高端感
6⃣银幕上的加持与文化影响：从赫本到梦露，明星效应强化法国品牌影响力✨
7⃣高端生活方式打造：不只是衣服包包，更是一种“精致的生活方式”
🫅强大的奢侈品集团
就像美国有科技四巨头 GAFA（Google、Amazon、Facebook、Apple）

▪️Kering开云集团：旗下有Gucci、YSL、Balenciaga、BV等。 ▪️Hermès爱马仕：独立但实力强劲，球最难买的品牌之一，以手工工艺闻名。 ▪️L'Oréal欧莱雅：美妆界的王者，旗下包含Lancôme、YSL Beauty、Kiehl's等
▪️LVMH路威酩轩：涵盖Louis Vuitton、Dior、Celine、Fendi等80+品品牌。 这些集团凭借并购➕品牌矩阵➕高端战略，牢牢掌控全球市场话语权。 法国奢侈品，是艺术、工艺、身份与文化的集合。 不是一只包，而是一个故事📖

526f67f3173ee2c07beda12ea74f5cb0,"  The late Queen Elizabeth allegedly 'saw through' Meghan Markle, and claimed her romance with Harry had become a 'complete catastrophe', just weeks before her death in September 2021. Prince Harry and his wife have always been at pains to stress that they enjoyed a warm bond with the late Queen, despite a rift with the other senior royals that has only deepened over the years. However, this week the Sussexes up and down relationship with the late Queen was revealed by journalist and royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith on her Substack Royal Extras , after her conversations with Her Majesty's late cousin Lady Elizabeth Anson. Lady Eliza, as she was known to friends, told Ms Bedell Smith that Harry had been 'rude' to his grandmother for 10 minutes during a meeting about his wedding and Meghan refused to disclose details of her dress, leaving the monarch 'saddened'. Her comments echo claims made previously in the Spectator magazine, that relations between Meghan, Harry and his grandmother were rather more complicated than the Sussexes have made out. According to a source, the Queen made some strongly-worded remarks about Meghan and Harry's union to guests at Balmoral just a month before she died. The source said: 'It was out of character for the Queen...but she saw straight through Meghan. ' At the drinks before the dinner, a small group were talking to the monarch and she explained that Harry meeting Meghan had become a complete catastrophe. Queen Elizabeth II and Meghan at an event in Cheshire in June 2018. During Meghan's brief time as a working royal, the Duchess and the Queen found themselves at loggerheads Meghan at the Queen's funeral. The late Queen allegedly described Meghan as 'evil' 'By this point we all knew the Queen's health was in decline and she had months left, she seemed regretful about how things had panned out.' By this stage, Harry and Meghan had stepped down as working royals and were living a new life in Montecito. When 'Megxit' was announced in January 2020, the late monarch released a statement saying: 'Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family.' That is not to say that relations between the couple and the monarch were always on an amicable footing with things beginning to sour during the planning of the couple's wedding, according to Lady Liza Anson. Born in Windsor Castle, Lady Elizabeth, a great-niece of the Queen Mother and a goddaughter of King George VI, was a high-society party planner. The Queen's first cousin, who arranged the Queen's 80th birthday party, allegedly said just days before Meghan and Harry's wedding: 'We hope but don't quite think she is in love. We think she engineered it all.' Meghan was apparently 'full of charm' and appeared 'natural, intelligent, and thoughtful' after she became engaged to Harry in 2017. But as the wedding approached, Meghan allegedly became increasingly 'bossy' and Liza said the Queen was privately 'very worried'. Ms Bedell Smith wrote: 'When we spoke two weeks before the May 19 wedding, Liza had just heard from the Queen. “The Number One Lady—I call her Jemima—says the jury is out on whether she likes Meghan,” said Liza. “My Jemima is very worried.” In Liza's view, “Harry is besotted and weak about women. Liza apparently said: 'It's worrying that so many people are questioning whether Meghan is right for Harry. The problem, bless his heart, is that Harry is neither bright nor strong, and she is both'. The cracks apparently appeared in February 2018. Liza claimed Harry wrote to her and said that his grandmother was 'content' with the way the wedding plans were coming along. But Sally Bedell Smith wrote that Liza had said: 'When I spoke with the Queen, she said she is not at all content'. Ms Bedell Smith wrote: 'According to Liza, the Queen was dismayed that Harry had asked the Archbishop of Canterbury to perform the wedding service in St. George's Chapel without first requesting permission from the Dean of Windsor. “Harry seems to think the Queen can do what she wants, but she can't,” said Liza. “On the religious side, it is the Dean of Windsor's jurisdiction.” As a result, Liza said that “Harry has blown his relationship with his grandmother. She said she was really upset. I was shocked when the Queen told me this, how she was so saddened. I had no idea about the conversation, that he was rude to her for ten minutes. They had tea with her the day before yesterday. She was trying to find out about the wedding dress, and Meghan wouldn't tell her.” .'

New reports claim the late Queen called their relationship a ""complete catastrophe"" in what insiders say was an uncharacteristically blunt moment from the monarch. Meghan Markle spotted humbly serving the Royal Family in rare look at family life Despite public efforts by the Sussexes to portray a warm relationship with the late Queen , royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith has shed new light on behind-the-scenes tensions, revealing that Elizabeth ""saw through Meghan "" and expressed deep disappointment over how things had unfolded between Harry and his wife. Bedell Smith published the claims in her Royal Extras Substack, citing personal conversations with Lady Elizabeth Anson , the Queen's late cousin and confidante, also known to friends as Lady Liza . According to her, Queen Elizabeth appeared both regretful and saddened during a pre-dinner conversation at Balmoral, where she discussed Harry's marriage in unusually candid terms. ""It was out of character for the Queen ,"" a source told Bedell Smith. ""But she saw straight through Meghan ."" Queen's concern about Meghan's influence and Harry's judgment Lady Liza , a highly connected member of the royal family and a former party planner for the Queen's 80th birthday, confided that tensions had emerged as early as the couple's wedding planning in 2018. She said Harry had been ""rude"" to his grandmother during a 10-minute meeting and that Meghan had refused to share details about her dress with the Queen , leaving her upset. In a particularly pointed remark, Liza reportedly told Bedell Smith just two weeks before the wedding, ""We hope but don't quite think she is in love. We think she engineered it all."" The Queen , according to Liza , was ""very worried,"" particularly as Meghan's behavior shifted from being charming and thoughtful to increasingly controlling. Liza also claimed that Harry had bypassed royal protocol by requesting that the Archbishop of Canterbury conduct the wedding without first consulting the Dean of Windsor . The Queen was ""dismayed"" by this, she said. The Queen allegedly remarked that Meghan's Givenchy gown was ""too white"" for a second wedding, believing it inappropriate for a divorcée marrying in church. Liza's verdict on Harry was no less severe: ""He is neither bright nor strong, and she is both."" She predicted trouble ahead for the marriage and described Meghan as someone who ""sees things in a different way."" Lilibet name dispute and Megxit's collapse Tensions only escalated after the wedding. The Queen reportedly reacted with dismay when the Sussexes named their daughter Lilibet , a personal childhood nickname used only by close family. ""I don't own the palaces, I don't own the paintings, the only thing I own is my name. And now they've taken that,"" the Queen is said to have told an aide. Though Harry and Meghan insisted they had received the Queen's blessing, insiders dispute this, and Robert Hardman , in his biography of King Charles , claimed that the Queen was ""as angry as I'd ever seen her"" following the announcement. The Queen's initial hope for a compromise arrangement during the Sussexes' royal departure - known as ""Megxit"" - also fell apart. Author Valentine Low wrote that Meghan's desire to earn money independently clashed with palace expectations for working royals. In the Queen's view, if they could not abide by the restrictions on commercial activity, they could not continue representing the Crown in any capacity. In the final years of her reign, Queen Elizabeth II remained committed to the monarchy's image, even at the cost of personal relationships. While her public messages maintained a tone of affection - stating that "" Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family"" before Lilibet was born - the private remarks emerging now suggest a more complicated and painful story behind closed doors.","J ust a month before her passing in September 2022, Queen Elizabeth II reportedly shared her true feelings about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in a private conversation at Balmoral.

Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder, which is SO GOOD at eliminating shine and blurring pores that I feel like it'd smirk at you and go, ""How 'bout that, huh? "" if it had a human form. If you dread summer because you love wearing makeup but the heat and humidity leave it looking patchy, this'll lock it in with a smooth, semi-matte finish. Your oily T-zone doesn't know what's coming for it. One reviewer compares this to a $59 Givenchy powder! Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""This is the secret for makeup in hot and humid climates! I am a sweaty person, but I also love wearing makeup regardless of the weather. While holidaying in Southeast Asia at the start of wet season, I faced temperatures between 35 and 40 degrees Celsius (95–104 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity. After finishing my base makeup, I applied this powder all over. I did not use a setting spray because most break me out. Luckily, no setting spray was necessary while using this setting powder! It kept my foundation and cream blush from separating or becoming patchy, and also kept me from being too shiny. I reapplied a couple of times per day. This is magical and I will definitely be using regularly during the summers in North America too!"" —Sara Lima Get it from Amazon for $25. 2. A smocked midi dress because Hill House's Nap Dress is truly ~dreamy~ but your bank account is like, ""Um, we still need to buy groceries."" This cutie's a fraction of the cost and just as gorgeous, not to mention breathable as heck thanks to its 100% organic cotton poplin fabric. Prepare to fall head over heels for this dress — I definitely did. I recently wore this dress (in shade Lipstick Pink) to an outdoor wedding and I. AM. OBSESSED. It hugs my frame beautifully with the stretchy smocked waist — I can even get away with not wearing a bra, though for context I'm a B cup — and the flowy bottom of the dress sits just right. I personally haven't tried Hill House's Nap Dress (I drool over the designs, but $178 is a little too steep for me), but I'm perfectly happy to stock up on this dress in a few colors for around the same price. My colleague Heather Braga, on the other hand, is a Hill House devotee — but even she was impressed by this cheaper option: ""Listen, I am the proud owner of NINE Hill House Nap Dresses. I condone splurging on them (truly, by all means) and will be the first to tell you they are worth every penny. That being said, I tried out one of these from Quince and LOVE it. I have the Tribeca Stripe pattern and cannot believe how similar it feels to the other brand. It's my current go-to style for my frame (two kids in two years, send prayers) and is one of the few things I know I can throw on and KNOW I look great. Will definitely add another to an upcoming order and have been shouting from the rooftops how wonderful this brand fits."" Get it from Quince for $69.90 (available in sizes XS–XL and nine styles). 3. E.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen if you're still trying to find a daily sunscreen you don't despise. This clear gel sunscreen offers SPF 35 and goes on so smooth and lightweight, you'll immediately forget you're wearing it — no white cast here, folks. It doubles as a blurring primer, so it's great for wearing under makeup too! If you love Supergoop but the price is becoming hard to swallow...may I suggest trying this, because it's *very* similar. The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop's cult-fave product end. I've tried both, and I honestly prefer this E.l.f. version. Supergoop's had a slight graininess to it that I didn't love, while this E.l.f. sunscreen is exactly what I'd hoped Supergoop's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top!...","This blurring powder is basically pure witchcraft and your *best* weapon against heat and humidity.

Paris Haute Couture Week is back with a bang, kicking off July's Fall 2025 couture shows with Schiaparelli's star-studded runway. Daniel Roseberry's “Back to the Future” collection explored Elsa Schiaparelli's signature designs from the 1930's with added glamour and futuristic flair, from metallic biker shoulders to a bejeweled anatomical heart, gleaming eye embroidery, and an array of flooring sheer-paneled silk gowns. Naturally, the occasion was witnessed by a chic crowd including Dua Lipa, Cardi B, Philippine Leroy-Beaulieu, Karol G, and Hunter Schafer. But that's just the tip of the haute couture iceberg! As the shows continue from July 7 to 10, keep an eye out for new collections from Chanel, Giorgio Armani Privé, Giambattista Valli, Robert Wun, Maison Margiela, Georges Hobeika, and Germanier—plus Demna's final collection for Balenciaga! Daniel Roseberry (Courtesy) All images: Courtesy of Schiaparelli Anne Hathaway Blossoms In Sarah Burton's Givenchy For Vogue's August Issue Anne Hathaway is in full bloom for her latest Vogue cover! The actress fronts the magazine's August 2025 issue in a new editorial exclusively styled by Tabitha Simmons, wearing nine looks from Sarah Burton's debut Givenchy Fall 2025 collection. For her shoot by Annie Leibovitz, Hathaway takes Burton's celebrated creations on a journey through New York City, including Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. While speaking with Maya Singer for her feature interview, Hathaway also chats about her new film Mother Mary, feeling like a “beginner” in her role as its titular pop star in crisis, and her new chapter of wide-ranging projects in the 2020's (which will also include new Princess Diaries and Devil Wears Prada sequels!) . “What struck me right away, reading the script, is that you can't 'perform' Mother Mary,” said Hathaway. “If I got the part, I would have to become material David could craft with. I had to submit to being a beginner. The humility of that—showing up every day knowing you're going to suck. And it has to be okay. You're not 'bad.' You're just a beginner. Getting to that mindset—I had to shed some things that were hard to shed. It was welcome. But it was hard, the way transformational experiences can be hard.” All images: Annie Leibovitz JW Anderson Steps Back From Runways—And Steps Into Home Design Jonathan Anderson's namesake JW Anderson brand is taking a break from the runway, According to Dazed, the beloved designer's eclectic label is stopping its seasonal runway shows and largely stepping back from releasing large fashion collections. Instead, the brand will focusing on creating accessories, staple fashion pieces, and luxury home goods—as well as expanding its retail footprint with new stores in New York, Paris, Belgravia, and Pimlico. Anderson's new Resort 2026 collection is the first to introduce the concept, featuring a thinner J.W. Anderson logo across the designer's signature whimsical knits and denim. His ready-to-wear pieces are paired with a range of his favorite curated objects, including re-editions of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's oak lamps and stools, curated books, vintage gardening tools, Lucie Rie mugs, Murano glassware, Jason Mosseri's Hope Spring chairs, Akiko Hirai's ceramics, Welsh blankets, hand-forged nails, Houghton Hall Estate honey, and Postcard Teas' coffee-flavored tea. For a personal touch, all are shown in the brand's new lookbook, featuring a cast of JWA collaborators and friends like Joe Alwyn, Bella Freud, Ben Whishaw, Luca Guadagnino, and more. All images: Courtesy of JW Anderson Megan Stalter Sparkles On Glamour's Digital July Cover Glamour has a new covergirl: Megan Stalter! The comedian and actress, known for her viral character videos and standout appearance on Hacks, is heading across the pond for her latest project: Lena Dunham's new rom-com Netflix series Too Much, out July 10. In her new cover story, Stalter dramatically poses in both glittering jewels and a bedazzled swimsuit—winking to American casual and formal British fashions—for photographer Luke Gilford. Her accompanying interview with Lindy Segal finds Stalter opening up on her first leading role, as well as growing up in Ohio, playing “talentless” characters, and approaching nudity onscreen. “I personally didn't feel the need to go fully topless,” Stalter says. “It all made sense to me without [nudity], and I never felt any pressure that it was needed.

Star appearances within the flick will include Marc Jacobs, Isaac Mizrahi, Jenna Lyons, George Takei, King Princess, Symone, Bill T.

1lty23e,"  Hey frag fam, 24M from Delhi here. I've been into fragrances for a while now, but most of what I know today is thanks to this amazing community. Whether it was going down rabbit holes on old threads or reading all the reviews and recommendations, I've learned so much — and I genuinely want to thank all the fellow fragheads here for helping me become a more cognoscenti person in this world of scent. I started out with just 2–3 designer bottles, and looking back now, I'm genuinely proud of how far I've come. From blindly wearing basic stuff to now appreciating note breakdowns, flankers, seasonal wear — it's been a fun and nerdy ride I used ChatGPT to help organize this post, but all opinions are mine. Here's my current designer starter pack – 15 fragrances, quick thoughts, and ratings: 1. YSL Y EDP – My all-time favourite. Clean, fresh, sweet, gets compliments without even trying. 10/10 2. 1 Million Lucky – Hazelnut and plum combo that's just addictive. Discontinued and that hurts. 9/10 3. Acqua Di Giò Profumo – Classy AF. Smells like a CEO went for a walk by the sea. 9/10 4. YSL MYSLF – At first I was like meh… but it grew on me. Fresh, musky, different. 8.5/10 5. Dior Homme Sport 2021 – Ginger kick with a clean drydown. Very easy to wear. 8.5/10 6. Armani Code Parfum – Softer, modern version of the OG. Perfect for close settings. 8.5/10 7. Acqua Di Giò Parfum (2024) – The newest one, and honestly pretty good. Fresh with depth. 8/10 8. 1 Million EDT – Loud, sweet, and still works when I want to stand out. Club or winter frag. 8/10 9. Terre d'Hermès EDT – Smells like grown-man confidence. Dirty orange + vetiver vibe. 8/10 10. Versace Dylan Blue – My safe pick when I don't know what to wear. Just works. 8/10 11. Afnan SNOI – Aventus vibes with darker, fruitier twist....","Hey frag fam, 24M from Delhi here.

可以是实证方面的，或者例如实体对齐、KBQA、知识表示学习等任务中的 idea。 【写在前面】在上篇里提到了Daydream如何正面硬刚和的Agentic Shopping，怀抱同样雄心的另一支创业团队Gensmo也在6月底正式发布了其2.0版本。 这个将自己定位为世界第一个AI Fashion Agent的平台，在美通社发稿宣传已筹集超过6000万美元的种子资金，自去年12月上线测试版App以来，帮助用户生成了超过1000万种风格匹配，并索引了1亿件时尚产品，在TikTok和Instagram上，每天UGC穿搭分享量达数千次，一些视频的观看次数超过百万。 创始人胡宁拥有卡内基梅隆大学人工智能博士学位，曾担任谷歌移动搜索技术主管和阿里巴巴副总裁。 采访中她强调：“时尚的未来并非人工智能取代个人风格，而是利用科技让用户能够自信地表达自我，这种平衡是Gensmo的核心。” 是的，部分场景下的AI产品在设计之初就应该秉承增强人类的理念，而不是取代；也正如我在之前博客文章里反复谈到的观点，时尚购物路程本身对很多人来说也是乐趣，应该节制AI的侵入感，保留更多的权力还给用户。 更何况在现实的技术意义上，该领域的知识图谱至今与人类理解尚未完全拉齐。 麦肯锡《The state of fashion 2024》报告预计，未来3至5年内，生成式AI可为时尚及奢侈品行业增加1500至2750亿美元的经营利润。 很多传统时尚企业在上一个信息化时代，数字基础设施不够完善，其中就包括企业知识图谱的构建，使得AI的应用基本依赖第三方的标准化技术服务，在电商内容生成和产品辅助设计流程中浅尝即止。 对于有些数字化程度较高的头部企业，也因为背负品牌形象的价值负担，谨慎避开了让AI与消费者直接交互的风险，将仍存在“幻觉”的AI应用于中后台。 比如LVMH正在利用Agent快速无缝地建立VIC客户档案，并向SA（销售助理 ）提供建议。 AI基于「客户偏好-产品信息-时尚共识」知识图谱的数据整合，可以预测客户喜欢哪些其他商品，哪些与之前的购买可以搭配，甚至是之前因为时间或勇气不足而不敢尝试的类型，那些SA不会推荐的产品——他们可能担心无效，导致客户的不信任或失望。 然而像Gensmo这样的新创公司没有这样的顾虑，将时尚搭配、搜索、虚拟试穿和沉浸式个性化氛围无缝集成到一个AI赋能的用户体验中。 鼓励用户上传已经和希望拥有的衣服、或从社交媒体或时尚出版物中汲取的任意风格灵感照片，又或者仅仅简单地用自然语言描述他们的具体需求。 然后智能引擎直接将这些输入快速转化为实用的建议，、甚至合适的发型和化妆技巧，并结合，让用户可以毫不费力地想象推荐的服装在自己身上的实际外观，加速「灵感—购物车—下单」旅程的转化。 实现这些愿景的根基是对时尚的深刻理解，当前的人工智能技术非常擅长结构化理性任务，但时尚和美——受文化、情感和个人经历的影响——本质上是主观的。 因此创新的指导性问题就是：“人工智能能否学习品味并理解美？” 要让专用的AI模型不断进化，从人类的经验中学习，就离不开时尚图谱。 欢迎订阅我的笔记：

在通用模型基座已经达到落地可用标准的当下，「领域知识」成为阻扰时尚行业AI Mass Adoption的瓶颈之一。 Google的Agentic智能购物采用了Shopping Graph，构建了产品-卖家-品牌-评论之间的语义网络，但这种围绕「产品知识」的图谱，无法捕捉超越客观属性的细致美学、文化和主观意义。 另外，在众多杰出的生图模型中，也因为对时尚风格的理解局限，导致生成的换装可控性总有遗憾。 我想时尚领域知识应该还需要另一图谱用于构建视觉元素的语义网络：「时尚图谱」Styling Graph。 无论是GPT-4V还是Gemini 2.5 Pro在通用视觉理解上也只有70分，更谈不上精准的时尚生成（包括自然语言问答、生图生视频）。 对此，我将分三篇系列文章从跨学科（社会学、语言学、符号学、知识管理、时尚心理等）角度，首先抛砖引玉，在理论层面尝试提出可能改进时尚视觉语言模型（FVLM）的三角研究框架：【视觉特征←→文本术语←→规则逻辑】。 下一步的工作是将这些抽象思想转化为具体的计算模型、数据结构和算法，构建一个具有明确评估方法论的稳健实验设计。 最终的目标是让三角框架能用于构建视觉语言训练（VLP）的数据库，结合检索增强生成技术（ RAG），为视觉语言模型（VLM）扩展能力边界，缓解模型的知识固化、长尾知识缺失与幻觉问题，使用知识图谱支撑大模型的可解释性。 考虑到Agentic端到端流程场景，将其装配到两个“大脑”，供给端的专家Agent，以及用户消费端的决策Agent。 每个Agent有——一个知识图谱后端确保答案正确且符合上下文，一个LLM 前端确保交互自然。 从更广阔的角度看，如果能够成功解决这些挑战，该方法将为其他需要主观解释、文化语境和隐性人类理解的领域（如艺术、设计、烹饪等）提供一个构建“文化智能”人工智能系统的蓝图。 为泛化多模态知识图谱提供一个强大的范式，弥合人工智能研究中长期存在的鸿沟。 2024年1月巴黎高级定制时装周夏帕瑞丽（Schiaparelli）让模特怀抱机器人婴儿 
Part-3. 规则逻辑 
System of Fashion 
“规则逻辑”是人类时尚知识的总结，包括习俗化的符号象征、公认的趣味标准等，往往隐含于经验之中，需要显式提取并编码到知识库。 在“图像特征 ←→ 文本术语 ←→ 规则逻辑”三角结构中，扮演约束和推理依据的角色。 这些规则涵盖色彩搭配的协调技巧、图案组合的宜忌、不同场合的着装礼仪、以及依据体型选择服饰的指南等等。 它是知识关联桥梁，连接图像提取的视觉特征和文本语义标签。 例如，当视觉分析识别出服装款式或颜色时，规则可以决定这些视觉元素在特定情境下的可接受性或搭配优劣，从而将感知层信息提升到知识层进行推理。 通过让模型生成并筛选自身的高质量多跳推理路径，提升对主观语义的解释能力 
把模糊的时尚知识转化为无数的三元组 <主 (Subject), 谓 (Predicate), 宾 (Object)> ，抽象为机器可读格式的无数“神经元”，从而构建结构化的语义神经网络形成知识图谱，形成知识库骨架。 将图像、感知和经验纳入，并在此类多模态上进行表征学习，这些规则节点/关系可以与服饰实体和属性术语相连，形成推理规则集。 有研究表明LLM中的长思维链（CoT）同样能有效提升VLM的性能。 将文本CoT数据迁移到多模态场景，微调的效果接近多模态蒸馏，也许能处理时尚图像中复杂的文化符号。 例如解决“何以成为Halo Element”时，模型需先定位设计元素，再分析颜色、纹理、廓形等文化关联，在意义层借助强化学习与时间戳向量实现可辩论的符号演化追踪，最后综合生成结论。 仅靠数据驱动的模型难以掌握丰富的常识和逻辑规则，更不必说那种最受顶尖玩家们追捧的时尚法则竟然是“犯错”——它是一种耐人寻味、有意为之、深思熟虑的刻意疏忽，无论是意大利人口中的Sprezzatura，还是代表巴黎女性的Effortless，还是现在我们家常挂在嘴边的「松弛感」。 也许利用Transformer技术路线天然的幻觉“劣势”，反而更容易突变出这种“高级感”。 2024年2月赞达亚 (

搭建领域知识规则的两种技术路径，也代表了AI进化史上模仿人类的两种选择： 
   隐式规则学习 – 数据驱动
当前学术研究多采用数据驱动的方法，从大规模服饰搭配数据中学习搭配模式，捕捉服饰之间更复杂的规则与关联（如多维度兼容性、季节与材质适配等）。 典型做法是利用度量学习或图神经网络，将服饰组成Outfit的兼容性用向量空间（Vector Space）表示出来。 这类方法能够从非结构化的流行趋势和用户行为中总结出“隐性规则”（如哪些单品常一起出现），但瓶颈在于：模型缺乏对显性时尚规则的了解，可能学到的数据模式难以解释，而且需要大量搭配数据支持。 当碰到新颖搭配或违反常规的组合时，模型难以判断好坏，因为缺少先验的规则知识。 典型例子是Polyvore时尚Outfit数据集，其中包含约6.8万套由时尚爱好者搭配的服饰集合，每套搭配都精心挑选确保风格统一。 这类数据提供了隐式的上下文：哪些单品经常一起出现、某件上衣通常配何种风格下装等。...","SPR_COMBO[zh] 可以是实证方面的，或者例如实体对齐、KBQA、知识表示学习等任务中的 idea。 【写在前面】在上篇里提到了Daydream如何正面硬刚和的Agentic Shopping，怀抱同样雄心的另一支创业团队Gensmo也在6月底正式发布了其2.0版本。 这个将自己定位为世界第一个AI Fashion Agent的平台，在美通社发稿宣传已筹集超过6000万美元的种子资金，自去年12月上线测试版App以来，帮助用户生成了超过1000万种风格匹配，并索引了1亿件时尚产品，在TikTok和Instagram上，每天UGC穿搭分享量达数千次，一些视频的观看次数超过百万。 创始人胡宁拥有卡内基梅隆大学人工智能博士学位，曾担任谷歌移动搜索技术主管和阿里巴巴副总裁。 采访中她强调：“时尚的未来并非人工智能取代个人风格，而是利用科技让用户能够自信地表达自我，这种平衡是Gensmo的核心。” 是的，部分场景下的AI产品在设计之初就应该秉承增强人类的理念，而不是取代；也正如我在之前博客文章里反复谈到的观点，时尚购物路程本身对很多人来说也是乐趣，应该节制AI的侵入感，保留更多的权力还给用户。 更何况在现实的技术意义上，该领域的知识图谱至今与人类理解尚未完全拉齐。 麦肯锡《The state of fashion 2024》报告预计，未来3至5年内，生成式AI可为时尚及奢侈品行业增加1500至2750亿美元的经营利润。 很多传统时尚企业在上一个信息化时代，数字基础设施不够完善，其中就包括企业知识图谱的构建，使得AI的应用基本依赖第三方的标准化技术服务，在电商内容生成和产品辅助设计流程中浅尝即止。 对于有些数字化程度较高的头部企业，也因为背负品牌形象的价值负担，谨慎避开了让AI与消费者直接交互的风险，将仍存在“幻觉”的AI应用于中后台。 比如LVMH正在利用Agent快速无缝地建立VIC客户档案，并向SA（销售助理 ）提供建议。 AI基于「客户偏好-产品信息-时尚共识」知识图谱的数据整合，可以预测客户喜欢哪些其他商品，哪些与之前的购买可以搭配，甚至是之前因为时间或勇气不足而不敢尝试的类型，那些SA不会推荐的产品——他们可能担心无效，导致客户的不信任或失望。 然而像Gensmo这样的新创公司没有这样的顾虑，将时尚搭配、搜索、虚拟试穿和沉浸式个性化氛围无缝集成到一个AI赋能的用户体验中。 鼓励用户上传已经和希望拥有的衣服、或从社交媒体或时尚出版物中汲取的任意风格灵感照片，又或者仅仅简单地用自然语言描述他们的具体需求。 然后智能引擎直接将这些输入快速转化为实用的建议，、甚至合适的发型和化妆技巧，并结合，让用户可以毫不费力地想象推荐的服装在自己身上的实际外观，加速「灵感—购物车—下单」旅程的转化。 实现这些愿景的根基是对时尚的深刻理解，当前的人工智能技术非常擅长结构化理性任务，但时尚和美——受文化、情感和个人经历的影响——本质上是主观的。 因此创新的指导性问题就是：“人工智能能否学习品味并理解美？” 要让专用的AI模型不断进化，从人类的经验中学习，就离不开时尚图谱。 欢迎订阅我的笔记： 2025年3月宇树机器人亮相 上海时装周NMTG秀场。 本文所有配图旨在回顾“机器人”与时尚连接的某些“表演”时刻。 当人工智能革命从「生成式」转入「代理式」阶段，AI也从基于人类输入生成合成内容的工具，进化为具有问题推理、方案规划与执行能力的，可以自主决策的“机器人”，无论它是否具有物理外观 Styling Graph (1)(2)(3) 共同的前言 （读过Graph-1 & 2 的朋友可以直接跳到Part-3. 规则逻辑部分） 在通用模型基座已经达到落地可用标准的当下，「领域知识」成为阻扰时尚行业AI Mass Adoption的瓶颈之一。 Google的Agentic智能购物采用了Shopping Graph，构建了产品-卖家-品牌-评论之间的语义网络，但这种围绕「产品知识」的图谱，无法捕捉超越客观属性的细致美学、文化和主观意义。 另外，在众多杰出的生图模型中，也因为对时尚风格的理解局限，导致生成的换装可控性总有遗憾。 我想时尚领域知识应该还需要另一图谱用于构建视觉元素的语义网络：「时尚图谱」Styling Graph。 无论是GPT-4V还是Gemini 2.5 Pro在通用视觉理解上也只有70分，更谈不上精准的时尚生成（包括自然语言问答、生图生视频）。 对此，我将分三篇系列文章从跨学科（社会学、语言学、符号学、知识管理、时尚心理等）角度，首先抛砖引玉，在理论层面尝试提出可能改进时尚视觉语言模型（FVLM）的三角研究框架：【视觉特征←→文本术语←→规则逻辑】。 下一步的工作是将这些抽象思想转化为具体的计算模型、数据结构和算法，构建一个具有明确评估方法论的稳健实验设计。 最终的目标是让三角框架能用于构建视觉语言训练（VLP）的数据库，结合检索增强生成技术（ RAG），为视觉语言模型（VLM）扩展能力边界，缓解模型的知识固化、长尾知识缺失与幻觉问题，使用知识图谱支撑大模型的可解释性。 考虑到Agentic端到端流程场景，将其装配到两个“大脑”，供给端的专家Agent，以及用户消费端的决策Agent。 每个Agent有——一个知识图谱后端确保答案正确且符合上下文，一个LLM 前端确保交互自然。 从更广阔的角度看，如果能够成功解决这些挑战，该方法将为其他需要主观解释、文化语境和隐性人类理解的领域（如艺术、设计、烹饪等）提供一个构建“文化智能”人工智能系统的蓝图。 为泛化多模态知识图谱提供一个强大的范式，弥合人工智能研究中长期存在的鸿沟。 2024年1月巴黎高级定制时装周夏帕瑞丽（Schiaparelli）让模特怀抱机器人婴儿 Part-3. 规则逻辑 System of Fashion “规则逻辑”是人类时尚知识的总结，包括习俗化的符号象征、公认的趣味标准等，往往隐含于经验之中，需要显式提取并编码到知识库。 在“图像特征 ←→ 文本术语 ←→ 规则逻辑”三角结构中，扮演约束和推理依据的角色。 这些规则涵盖色彩搭配的协调技巧、图案组合的宜忌、不同场合的着装礼仪、以及依据体型选择服饰的指南等等。 它是知识关联桥梁，连接图像提取的视觉特征和文本语义标签。 例如，当视觉分析识别出服装款式或颜色时，规则可以决定这些视觉元素在特定情境下的可接受性或搭配优劣，从而将感知层信息提升到知识层进行推理。 通过让模型生成并筛选自身的高质量多跳推理路径，提升对主观语义的解释能力 把模糊的时尚知识转化为无数的三元组 <主 (Subject), 谓 (Predicate), 宾 (Object)> ，抽象为机器可读格式的无数“神经元”，从而构建结构化的语义神经网络形成知识图谱，形成知识库骨架。 将图像、感知和经验纳入，并在此类多模态上进行表征学习，这些规则节点/关系可以与服饰实体和属性术语相连，形成推理规则集。 有研究表明LLM中的长思维链（CoT）同样能有效提升VLM的性能。 将文本CoT数据迁移到多模态场景，微调的效果接近多模态蒸馏，也许能处理时尚图像中复杂的文化符号。 例如解决“何以成为Halo Element”时，模型需先定位设计元素，再分析颜色、纹理、廓形等文化关联，在意义层借助强化学习与时间戳向量实现可辩论的符号演化追踪，最后综合生成结论。 仅靠数据驱动的模型难以掌握丰富的常识和逻辑规则，更不必说那种最受顶尖玩家们追捧的时尚法则竟然是“犯错”——它是一种耐人寻味、有意为之、深思熟虑的刻意疏忽，无论是意大利人口中的Sprezzatura，还是代表巴黎女性的Effortless，还是现在我们家常挂在嘴边的「松弛感」。 也许利用Transformer技术路线天然的幻觉“劣势”，反而更容易突变出这种“高级感”。 2024年2月赞达亚 ( Zendaya)身穿Mugler 1995年作品“机器人套装”出席《 沙丘2》的首映红毯 搭建领域知识规则的两种技术路径，也代表了AI进化史上模仿人类的两种选择： 隐式规则学习 – 数据驱动 当前学术研究多采用数据驱动的方法，从大规模服饰搭配数据中学习搭配模式，捕捉服饰之间更复杂的规则与关联（如多维度兼容性、季节与材质适配等）。 典型做法是利用度量学习或图神经网络，将服饰组成Outfit的兼容性用向量空间（Vector Space）表示出来。 这类方法能够从非结构化的流行趋势和用户行为中总结出“隐性规则”（如哪些单品常一起出现），但瓶颈在于：模型缺乏对显性时尚规则的了解，可能学到的数据模式难以解释，而且需要大量搭配数据支持。 当碰到新颖搭配或违反常规的组合时，模型难以判断好坏，因为缺少先验的规则知识。 典型例子是Polyvore时尚Outfit数据集，其中包含约6.8万套由时尚爱好者搭配的服饰集合，每套搭配都精心挑选确保风格统一。 这类数据提供了隐式的上下文：哪些单品经常一起出现、某件上衣通常配何种风格下装等。...",2025-07-07 16:29:37,zh,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The text is a lengthy technical article about AI in fashion and technology, with no substantive mention or discussion of Givenchy fragrances or the brand's specific products.

In 2023, she took the creative helm at Fiorucci, the legendary Italian label founded in 1967 by Elio Fiorucci. Tasked with revitalizing a brand known for its irreverence and pop spirit, Murri has already presented four collections that pulse with energy, color, and optimism. Murri's approach to Fiorucci is equal parts reverence and reinvention. Drawing deeply from the house's rich archive, she reinterprets its iconic motifs—lips, angels, hearts, through a modern, playful lens. Her debut collection, unveiled at Milan Fashion Week in September 2023, set the tone for her tenure: a vibrant celebration of joy, freedom, and creativity, all rooted in Fiorucci's signature DNA. The upcoming “ Beatittudo ” FW25 collection continued this narrative, inspired by the pursuit of pure happiness and characterized by a bold palette that injects fresh energy into the brand. Under Francesca Murri, Fiorucci has become a platform for experimentation and dialogue, embracing collaborations with artists and emerging talents from across the creative spectrum. Her vision is about more than clothes; it's about fostering a community and spreading positive messages that resonate in today's world. By blending the brand's storied past with the needs and languages of modern society, Murri is ensuring Fiorucci's legacy remains as dynamic and relevant as ever. Below, Francesca Murri discusses with DSCENE's EIC Zarko Davinic her creative process, the role of Milan, the power of contrasts, and her hopes for Fiorucci's future post her Spring Summer 2026 runway show in Milan . Photo ©Sohom Das   What does it mean for you and Fiorucci to present your collections in Milano every season? How does the city's unique energy influence your creative process? – Milano is where Elio Fiorucci created everything and started dreaming. It's crucial for me to catch the spirit of the city and put it into a very international narrative. Influences come from everywhere in this place full of art. Piazza Fiorucci is described as a space where everyday reality and fantasy meet. How did you translate this concept into both the collection and the show's outdoor set design? – For the collection I asked Janina Zais to work body painting and hair spraying the models to inject the cartoonish approach into the products. I also take inspiration, for the red pois dress, from the Walt Disney character Minnie. For the set design I wanted to use banners that represented the sky and road signs on the ground with totally invented and fantastic elements such as the angel shooting the arrow. The collection is full of contrasts, urban yet dreamlike, tender yet sensual. How do you approach balancing these opposing elements in your designs? – I play very much with contrasts that are very crucial for the brand. When there's something basic I apply something unexpected in a very Fiorucci way. And also the contrast played through the association between products and faces is very important. Rock characters with chic products and the opposites work very well. Many pieces play with iconic Fiorucci motifs, like the lips, angels, and hearts, reimagined in playful, pop-art ways. What draws you to these symbols, and how do you keep them feeling fresh? – I always start by defining the key pillars of the brand and based on the seasonal concept I focus on the ones that help me to push forward the concept. This season the pop, cartoonish approach influenced my way to characterize them. The slogan “Make Hearts Beat Again” featured on accessories and tees is both affectionate and provocative. What message are you hoping to send with this phrase? – In these uncertain moments in which everyone is a bit scared, I wanted send out a positive message by inviting people to make hearts beat again. An ode to love! Photo ©Sohom Das   The collection uses a bold color palette and a mix of classic and innovative materials, from recycled PVC to Tyvek and glossy coatings. How do you decide which materials best express a new Fiorucci era? – We usually search for innovative materials and this is very important to express the feelings I am having at the beginning of the creative process. The unexpected approach to the usage of the materials can create uniqueness. In a time when the fashion industry faces economic challenges and a looming recession, what do you believe will help brands like Fiorucci stay resilient and relevant? – It's hard for the new projects to find a place in this tough and crowded market. I believe that Fiorucci can have a role in society by creating a platform for collaborations with emerging talents to generate very creative contents not only in fashion but also in art and music. Looking ahead, how do you see Fiorucci's identity evolving? What are your hopes for the brand, and for the industry? – I see the project more mature season after season. I hope the market will get better soon to have more opportunities to reach our targeted clients throughout pop ups and stores and give them more chances to experience the brand.

En un momento donde las redes sociales, las plataformas de streaming y los grandes eventos marcan la pauta, algunos nombres destacan no solo por su talento, sino por ese halo irresistible que los convierte en auténticos iconos de seducción. A continuación, presentamos un ranking de los famosos más atractivos del momento, tanto dentro como fuera de España, que dominan titulares, alfombras rojas y corazones por igual. Para realizar este artículo hemos utilizado la ayuda del ChatGPT, una herramienta que funciona con inteligencia artificial. 1-Manu Ríos Desde que se hizo mundialmente conocido por su papel en Élite, Manu Ríos no ha dejado de escalar en el mundo de la moda, el entretenimiento y las redes sociales. Su elegancia natural y su estilo andrógino lo han llevado a protagonizar campañas para firmas como Balmain, Givenchy o Dior, consolidándose como un referente estético para las nuevas generaciones. 2-Ester Expósito Pocas actrices españolas han causado tanto impacto mediático en tan poco tiempo como Ester Expósito. Su papel en Élite fue solo el inicio de una carrera que no ha dejado de evolucionar, y su presencia en alfombras rojas internacionales la ha convertido en una auténtica embajadora del glamour. Más allá de sus rasgos delicados y su porte elegante, Ester desprende seguridad, intensidad y una energía arrolladora que la ha colocado entre las mujeres más deseadas del mundo. En redes sociales supera los 30 millones de seguidores, una cifra que habla de su impacto más allá de la pantalla. 3-Michele Morrone El actor y cantante italiano Michele Morrone alcanzó fama mundial gracias a su papel en la trilogía erótica 365 DNI, pero desde entonces ha demostrado que su talento va mucho más allá de la estética. Su físico imponente, su mirada penetrante y su voz grave lo han convertido en un icono de sensualidad, pero también en un artista completo. 4-Ana de Armas Cuba y España se dan la mano en la figura de Ana de Armas, una actriz que ha conquistado Hollywood con su belleza hipnótica y su talento frente a las cámaras. Desde Knives Out hasta Blonde, pasando por la saga de James Bond, ha dejado claro que su presencia no es casualidad. Ana combina un rostro de belleza singular con una carrera cuidadosamente trazada, y eso la convierte en una de las actrices más codiciadas del momento. 5-Mario Casas Mario Casas ha sido, durante más de una década, uno de los actores más deseados del panorama español y en 2025 su popularidad sigue intacta. Con una imagen más madura y una carrera consolidada, el intérprete ha sabido reinventarse, alejándose del estereotipo adolescente que lo lanzó a la fama en Tres metros sobre el cielo. Su cuerpo trabajado, su voz rasgada y su actitud desenfadada siguen generando suspiros, pero también lo ha hecho su evolución profesional. Mario se ha ganado el respeto del sector con papeles complejos y arriesgados, lo que ha reforzado su atractivo como hombre completo: seductor, comprometido y cercano. 6-Zendaya No hay alfombra roja, portada de revista ni desfile donde Zendaya pase desapercibida. La actriz y cantante estadounidense ha redefinido lo que significa ser atractiva en la era actual: segura de sí misma, multifacética y con un estilo que oscila entre lo urbano y lo vanguardista. 7-Álex González Con más de dos décadas de carrera a sus espaldas, Álex González sigue siendo uno de los hombres más atractivos del panorama nacional. Su participación en series como El Príncipe o Toy Boy lo han mantenido en el foco, y su físico imponente, combinado con una mirada intensa, le otorgan un aura de galán clásico. Fuera de la pantalla, Álex ha sabido mantener un perfil bajo, lo que le ha conferido cierto aire de misterio. Sus apariciones públicas son siempre medidas, pero cuando lo hace, acapara todas las miradas. El equilibrio entre lo reservado y lo apasionado lo coloca en esta lista sin discusión. 8-Timothée Chalamet Delicado, creativo, enigmático. Timothée Chalamet no responde a los cánones tradicionales de belleza masculina, y tal vez por eso genera tanta fascinación. El actor franco-estadounidense ha conquistado tanto a la crítica como al público joven gracias a su sensibilidad, su versatilidad interpretativa y su capacidad de expresar emoción con una sola mirada. 9-Blanca Suárez Pocas actrices nacionales combinan belleza, elegancia y carisma como Blanca Suárez. Su carrera se ha movido entre la televisión, el cine y la moda, pero ha sido su personalidad —desenfadada, directa, sin artificios— la que la ha convertido en un referente de atractivo natural. 10-Henry Cavill Aunque su fama se consolidó como Superman, Henry Cavill ha demostrado ser mucho más que un rostro esculpido. Su porte británico, su voz grave y su presencia imponente lo convierten en un ícono de masculinidad clásica, pero con una dimensión moderna que lo hace irresistible.","SPR_COMBO[es]En OKDIARIO hemos utilizado la inteligencia artificial para responder a una pregunta interesante Tenemos un ranking para catalogar a los famsosos más atractivos del momento El atractivo no depende únicamente de su apariencia física.

The actor, who broke through on the Regency-era Netflix series Bridgerton, has joined the cast of Darrah Cloud's House of McQueen as the titular Lee Alexander McQueen. The off-Broadway production following the life and career of the famed designer will open at the Mansion at Hudson Yards later this summer. “It is our absolute pleasure to announce Luke's involvement with House of McQueen,” executive producer Rick Lazes said, per Deadline. “We can't think of anyone better suited to bring Lee's story to life than this incredibly impressive multi-hyphenate.” Newton revealed news of the role on Instagram, where he posted three photos of McQueen, who died in 2010 at the age of 40. “It is the story of a boy born in the east end of London, who literally wears his heart on his sleeve, never meant to rise beyond his working-class family,” an official synopsis of the play reads. “From making doll clothes for his mother's friends to working in a tailor shop, he rises to the top of the fashion industry as chief designer for Givenchy and head of his own legendary fashion line, as his fashion shows become theatrical and artistic spectacles, attracting countless celebrities.” It continues: “Seeking to find beauty in the most devastating aspects of life, McQueen envisions and creates clothes to empower women in response to what is happening in his life and the world around him. Fighting against the commercial interests of legendary houses like Givenchy and Gucci to remain provocative, he challenges norms and pushes boundaries as an artist. In the end, the fight consumes him.” House of McQueen was written by Cloud and will be directed by Sam Helfrich. It will be the first production to grace the stage at The Mansion, which will open for previews on Aug. 19 and officially begin on Sept. 9. Newton's return to theater follows his stints in the West End production of The Book of Mormon and Neil LaBute's The Shape of Things.","Luke Newton at British Vogue/Netflix event for BAFTA Television Awards on May 8, 2025. - Credit: Jed Cullen/Dave Benett/ Luke Newton is stepping into the world of fashion with some major shoes to fill.

I, Tarun Kumar Oberoi, am the registered owner of Hyundai Creta (Reg No: UK17P9825, Black), which was stolen in less than 60 seconds on the night of 25th June 2025 from outside B-40, opposite HDFC Bank, Amar Colony, Lajpat Nagar 4, New Delhi.

Since marrying Prince William in 2011, Princess Kate has worn four different tiaras from the royal collection on numerous occasions. The reason for Kate's tiara hiatus is partially due to her stepping out of the spotlight for most of 2024 while she focused on cancer treatment.

Prince Edward and Sophie, the Duke and Duchess of Edinburgh, also joined the evening banquet as well as Princess Anne, the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and more members of the royal family.

After dinner, guests were served Taylor's 1977 Vintage Port and a 1948 Grande Champagne Cognac by Frapin & Co, reflecting the years of President Macron's and King Charles' births.

The flowing silk creponne gathered evening gown featured a cape back detailing. The Princess paired it with an evening clutch embroidered with a lily of the valley motif as well as the Lover's Knot Tiara. The diadem, made by the House of Garrard in 1913, consists of diamonds and a collection of 19 hanging pearls set in silver and gold. The Lover's Knot was also a favorite of the late Princess Diana. The Princess of Wales's choice of Sarah Burton for Givenchy is a clear statement of fashion diplomacy: a design by a British woman for a French fashion house, it serves as a sartorial symbol of the symbiotic relationship between the two European countries. It is also a moment that will excite followers of the fashion industry. Dressing the Princess for the state banquet is one of the highest-profile moments thus far for Burton during her tenure as Givenchy's creative director. Her appointment was announced in September 2024 and her debut collection was shown in March 2025. Previously, Elle Fanning wore one of her designs to the Oscars, as did Cynthia Erivo to the 2025 Tony Awards. It also further cements Middleton's role as a perennial muse for Burton. The designer was the creative mastermind behind the royal's now iconic ivory lace wedding dress, which she wore to marry Prince William at Westminster Abbey in 2011. She also designed three separate looks for the Princess's ethereal birthday portraits. Like Queen Elizabeth's longstanding relationship with British fashion designer Norman Hartnell, it seems that Sarah Burton and the Princess of Wales will continue to etch their fashion story together.","Tonight, the Princess of Wales made a statement in a dark red Givenchy by Sarah Burton gown to a state banquet at Windsor Castle honoring French President Emmanuel Macron.

Read the original article on People","Queen Camilla previously debuted the special badge Stephanie Petit Link copied Chris Jackson/Getty Kate Middleton at the state banquet at Windsor Castle on July 8, 2025 NEED TO KNOW Kate Middleton attended the state banquet at Windsor Castle in honor of the French state visit The Princess of Wales wore her first tiara since December 2023, and she also debuted a new royal accessory Queen Camilla previously wore the badge in June 2024 during the Japanese state banquet, which Kate didn't attend Kate Middleton's return to state banquets came with a regal new accessory. The Princess of Wales, 43, joined Prince William, King Charles, Queen Camilla and more members of the royal family at Windsor Castle on July 8 for the state banquet honoring French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte Macron, as part of their state visit to the U.K. The outing marked Kate's first time attending a state banquet since 2023, as she missed two similar events last year as she focused on her cancer treatment out of the public eye. In addition to wearing her first tiara in a year and a half, Princess Kate also debuted her Royal Family Order of King Charles III. She pinned the badge featuring a miniature portrait of her father-in-law with a pale blue ribbon on her sash, just above the late Queen Elizabeth's Royal Family Order. Queen Camilla previously wore the King's Royal Family Order at the Japan state visit in June 2024, making her the first person to wear it. She wore the piece again at the France state banquet. Aaron Chown - Pool/Getty King Charles' Royal Family Order, worn by Queen Camilla on July 8, 2025 Buckingham Palace said in a statement at the time, ""The tradition of commissioning a Family Order, a badge worn by female members of the royal family personally bestowed by the sovereign, was established by King George IV over 200 years ago. Family Orders have since been instituted by Queen Victoria, King Edward VII, King George V, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth II."" The honor was specially created for women in 1821, in part because only men could receive many honors. The Family Order is personally given out by the monarch without consultation with the government, traditionally after a female royal has been acting as a working member of the family for several years. Princess Kate has slowly returned to her royal duties since announcing in January that she is in remission. However, she is still working to balance her public duties with her recovery and recently spoke about the ""really difficult"" phase that follows treatment during her visit to Colchester Hospital on July 2. ""You put on a sort of brave face, stoicism through treatment. Treatment's done, then it's like, 'I can crack on, get back to normal,' but actually, the phase afterwards is really, really difficult,"" she said during the outing.

mov_2D2C5C9F165679D0A267720A61495321,"  More than 15 years after Alexander McQueen's death, the fashion designer's career is coming into sharper focus with an off-Broadway show. One of the most acclaimed and incendiary designers of his generation, McQueen took his life in 2010 at the age of 40 in London. Daring and original with his designs and runway shows, the British-born talent burst on the scene in the 1990s. The son of a taxi driver and self-described “big mouth East English yob,” McQueen rose to the top of the fashion world. With his 1995 controversial Highland Rape collection that used remnants from fabric shops, McQueen caught the attention of European luxury titans. In 1996, Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, tapped the then-27-year-old to be the creative lead at Givenchy, a post he held for five years. In 2000, the Gucci Group bought a 51 percent stake in McQueen's company, allowing for expansion via signature boutiques; a secondary line called McQ licensed to Italy's SINV; menswear and leather goods, and collaborations with brands including Puma and Samsonite. Despite such reach and a Target collaboration in 2009, his namesake company did not have the financial might of his rivals, during his lifetime. A decade in the making, “House of McQueen” starts previews next month and the grand opening will be held Sept. 9 at the Mansion at Hudson Yards. In a joint interview Tuesday with show producer Rick Lazes and Gary McQueen, a nephew of the designer, Lazes said, “What would Lee do?” was their mantra, whenever they felt tripped up. (The designer was known as Lee to family and close friends.) The theater — the first new one to be built in Manhattan in more than 20 years — was financed and designed by their company Alexander McQueen LLC. McQueen said, “There are obviously a lot of complexities in Lee's life, both personally and his rise into the elites of fashion from his humble beginnings. That is really a true underdog story, and a very inspiring one. Hopefully, what we've achieved with this inspires the younger generation who don't really know Alexander McQueen the person, but also satisfies long-term fans of my uncle's work. It does touch some personal stuff.” Lazes said, “No matter what obstacles he encountered, he overcame them and his art continued to flourish, Despite adversity and the mercantile pressure of the fashion industry, his genius shone through. We're hoping people will leave the theater feeling like they've seen genius. For those who don't know McQueen, it will be like seeing Picasso for the first time. He [McQueen] was never accepted as a great artist, which he clearly was. He was always relegated as a fashion designer. We're hoping people will see that he influenced not only the fashion world, but music, art and pop culture. And he still does today.” Meant to be a well-rounded and entertaining representation of the designer's life, the 90-minute seated performance will feature “Bridgerton” actor Luke Newton in the lead role. Family members and other key figures in McQueen's life like Isabella Blow will also be portrayed. Ticket holders will also have access to a concurrent exhibition of original McQueen gowns that will be adjacent to the theater. With more than 1,000 square feet of LED screens, the show will feature creative content that was developed with Gary McQueen's oversight about Lee's motivation, thoughts and drive for creative genius to play up his art, work and spirit. Needless to say McQueen-designed pieces will not be worn by the actors. To write the play, Darrah Cloud drew from previous media interviews with the designer and from conversations with his nephew, who is an artist. After Gary McQueen lost his father unexpectedly, Lee McQueen stepped in to babysit him as an older brother might. Years later, they worked together. He said, “There's a certain spirit attached to being a McQueen. I share a similar aesthetic that is both inspired by Lee, but that is also quite inherent to myself,” his nephew said. What I've learned from Lee is what fashion could be. It went way beyond clothes and fashion. It was about storytelling and artistry.” Looking forward to sharing McQueen's mannerisms and gestures with Newton, Gary McQueen said, “Lee almost had two sides to himself, where he had a split personality. He was a very down-to-earth person, and at other times, he was Alexander McQueen, who ruled his kingdom in the fashion world. He kind of separated himself from family and to who he was professionally.” Showgoers may be surprised by how McQueen managed “to break down barriers and the snobbery that was attached to fashion houses at that time,” his nephew said. Coming of age in the 1990s, when many edgy designers and artists were making waves in various industries, that trajectory is “very relatable to how the world is quite a hard place today.” Gary McQueen's aim is to continue his uncle's legacy through his art. Wishful that they had had more time together, he said, “Lee could have achieved so much more. He never ran out of creative ideas. The only thing that took the joy away from what he did was the pressures of coming up with so many collections. As an artist, that really gets in the way of being creative. I feel that the pressure got to be too much for him.” Innovative with technology, the designer crafted a hologram of Kate Moss for his fall 2006 runway show. Speculating how technical advances like 3D printing and other ones used by Iris Van Herpen would have appealed to McQueen, his nephew said, “There was a lot more that he could have achieved....","More than 15 years after Alexander McQueen's death, the fashion designer's career is coming into sharper focus with an off-Broadway show.

As Kate joined King Charles, Queen Camilla, and Prince William at Windsor Castle to welcome French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte, her royal ensemble was all about class and diplomacy. The evening marked the start of the French state visit, and of course, all eyes were on Kate as she strutted down the grand banquet hall.

It was glamorous without being too over the top, a look that Kate is best known for. And, as if the look wasn't striking enough on it's own, her accessories told a rich story too. Perched atop her head was the Lover's Knot tiara, a piece that once belonged to Princess Diana and was originally made for Queen Mary back in 1913. It is also one of Kate's most treasured and worn pieces, although this seems to be her first major tiara moment since 2023. For more sparkle, the Princess of Wales put on the diamond chandelier earrings from the late Queen Elizabeth's collection, while a dainty clutch embroidered with lily of the valley flowers expertly complimented the look. If you haven't guessed by now, when it comes to nostalgic nods and symbolic messages through fashion, no one does it quite like Kate!","Kate Middleton turned heads at the Windsor state banquet in a deep burgundy Givenchy gown by Sarah Burton, blending British tradition with French flair.On a night full of royal sparkle and diplomatic charm, Kate, the Princess of Wales turned heads in her striking new look at the State Banquet.

(Jemal Countess/WireImage for Saks Fifth Ave – NY) An off-Broadway play celebrating the life and career of gay fashion designer Alexander McQueen, titled House of McQueen, is in the works, and a Bridgerton star is set to portray the late icon. On Tuesday (8 July), Deadline reported that none other than actor Luke Newton will be stepping into McQueen's metaphorical dress shoes in the production, House of McQueen. The out gay fashion designer died in 2010 at the age of 40.

Fighting against the commercial interests of legendary houses like Givenchy and Gucci to remain provocative, he challenges norms and pushes boundaries as an artist. In the end, the fight consumes him.” Directing House of McQueen is Angels in America director Sam Helfrich, while Rick Lazes (Lennox Lewis: The Untold Story), and McQueen's nephew, Gary James, are both joining as executive producer and creative director, respectively.

Prince Harry and his wife have always been at pains to stress that they enjoyed a warm bond with the late Queen, despite a rift with the other senior royals that has only deepened over the years. However, this week the Sussexes up and down relationship with the late Queen was revealed by journalist and royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith on her Substack Royal Extras, after her conversations with Her Majesty's late cousin Lady Elizabeth Anson.

Her comments echo claims made previously in the Spectator magazine, that relations between Meghan, Harry and his grandmother were rather more complicated than the Sussexes have made out. According to a source, the Queen made some strongly-worded remarks about Meghan and Harry's union to guests at Balmoral just a month before she died. The source said: 'It was out of character for the Queen...but she saw straight through Meghan.

By this stage, Harry and Meghan had stepped down as working royals and were living a new life in Montecito. When 'Megxit' was announced in January 2020, the late monarch released a statement saying: 'Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family.' That is not to say that relations between the couple and the monarch were always on an amicable footing with things beginning to sour during the planning of the couple's wedding, according to Lady Liza Anson. Born in Windsor Castle, Lady Elizabeth, a great-niece of the Queen Mother and a goddaughter of King George VI, was a high-society party planner.

The cracks apparently appeared in February 2018. Liza claimed Harry wrote to her and said that his grandmother was 'content' with the way the wedding plans were coming along. But Sally Bedell Smith wrote that Liza had said: 'When I spoke with the Queen, she said she is not at all content'.

Emmanuel Macron was welcomed to Windsor Castle for a glittering banquet on Tuesday, as he was pictured clinking glasses and winking at royals. The French president sat amongst the likes of Mick Jagger and Elton John at the star-studded event on the first day of his state visit to the UK. The Princess of Wales was dressed in a dark red silk Givenchy gown as she sat next to Mr Macron for her first state banquet since her cancer diagnosis. The president was pictured winking and chatting with Kate as she sat next to Mr Macron wearing her favourite Lover's Knot tiara – a piece much loved by Diana, Princess of Wales. The princess and and her husband, the Prince of Wales, were pictured smiling and gazing at each other as they arrived together, walking side by side before the banquet at the castle. They were joined by other members of the royal family including the King and Queen, plus some 160 guests, in Windsor Castle's impressive St George's Hall. The King was seated between Mr Macron and French culture minister Rachida Dati, while Kate was on the other side of the French president. The Queen was on the other side of the table, between Brigitte Macron and French armed forces minister Sebastien Lecornu. On the other side of Mrs Macron was heir to the throne William. Staff said the table had taken six days to set up, with a highly polished table running the length of the room, decorated with hand-picked seasonal flowers and herbs from palace gardens. The menu, which was written in French as is the custom for state banquets, began with a selection of tender summer vegetables from the Gardens of Le Manoir with Sage, Raw Tomato and Extra Virgin Olive Oil Dressing. The next course was Supreme of Rhug Estate Chicken with Norfolk Asparagus and Tarragon Cream, followed by Iced Blackcurrant Parfait on a Blackcurrant-soaked Sponge with Elderflower Jelly for dessert. In a tradition started by the King, a cocktail was also created specially for the occasion, this time called L'entente. It combined British gin with lemon curd and French pastis, garnished with dried French cornflowers and English roses. Both the monarch and President delivered speeches at the event, where prime minister Sir Keir Starmer was also present. The King joked about the popular French cartoon character Asterix the Gaul's incomprehension about Britons' love of tea with a splash of milk, and how dinner guests had drunk “English sparkling wine made by a French Champagne house”. And he described the “perfect combinations” of French and British – Monet's paintings of London fog and Thierry Henry, a former French striker most famous for his time with Arsenal, scoring at Highbury. The French president even winked at the King when Charles mentioned the cultural ties between the UK and France and how a Frenchman, William the Conqueror, began building Windsor Castle more than 900 years ago and his son William has made Windsor his home. The King also spoke of more serious matters including the deepening co-operation between the UK and France that will protect against “profound challenges” such as terrorism, organised crime and “irregular migration” across the English Channel. In his speech Charles described the UK's closest continental neighbour as “one of our strongest allies” and said in the face of “complex threats” France and Britain “must help to lead the way”. Mr Macron also delivered a speech mostly in French but in English he spoke about France's loan of the Bayeux Tapestry which will go on display at the British Museum next year. Earlier in a speech to MPs and peers, Mr Macron promised to deliver on measures to cut the number of migrants crossing the English Channel, describing the issue as a “burden” to both countries. He told the gathering in Parliament: “France and the UK have a shared responsibility to address irregular migration with humanity, solidarity and fairness.” Decisions at Thursday's UK-France summit will “respond to our aims for co-operation and tangible results on these major issues”. Other notable invitees who turned out for the glittering banquet with Charles, were actress Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, former England goalkeeper Mary Earps, who now plays for Paris Saint-Germain, authors Joanne Harris and Sebastian Faulks and sculptor Sir Antony Gormley. Sir Mick, whose formal white place card read “Sir Michael Jagger”, was seated between Dame Kristin and Alice Rufo, director general for international relations and strategy of the French ministry for the armed forces. Sir Elton, who has severe vision issues after contracting an eye infection, was seated next to his husband, rather than apart which is usually the custom for couples at royal banquets. Also making an appearance was First Dates' Fred Sirieix, as well as the French singer Mika, who was sat next to the Duchess of Edinburgh.

Of those 15 tiara moments, 10 of them have been in the Queen Mary Lovers' Knot tiara—which was also the favorite tiara of Princess Diana. The Princess of Wales wore the Lovers' Knot tiara again on July 8 for a state banquet honoring France's President Emmanuel Macron and First Lady Brigitte Macron at Windsor Castle. Every tiara tells a story, and the deliberate choice of Kate Middleton wearing the Queen Mary Lovers' Knot tiara to last night's French state banquet is no exception. The Princess of Wales's favorite tiara—like her mother-in-law Princess Diana before her—is the Lovers' Knot, worn for 10 of the future queen's 15 tiara moments so far since marrying into the royal family in 2011. As Maxwell Stone of U.K. jeweler Steven Stone pointed out, the Lovers' Knot was the “very first Kate wore as Princess of Wales, making the moment deeply meaningful,” estimating that the sparkler is valued $135 million, “or potentially more, considering the legacies of the remarkable women who have worn it,” Stone said. “This piece is a true royal treasure,” he said of the tiara, adding that it is “renowned for its existing craftsmanship.” Kate Middleton and France's President Emmanuel Macron on July 8, 2025. Getty “The tiara is famously heavy enough to have caused discomfort to Princess Diana, underscoring the exceptional quality of the diamonds and pearls it holds,” Stone said. The tiara—which was reportedly so heavy it gave Diana headaches—was created in 1914 by Garrard for Queen Mary, who, following her death in 1953, passed the topper down to her granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth. After Diana married Prince Charles in 1981, the Queen gave the tiara to her, and she wore it many times throughout her royal life before returning it to the Queen following her divorce from Charles in 1996. The tiara wasn't seen again until her daughter-in-law Kate wore it nearly two decades later, bringing it out of the vault in 2015 for a diplomatic reception at Buckingham Palace. Prince William and Kate Middleton. Getty The Princess of Wales—who wore bespoke red Sarah Burton for Givenchy Tuesday evening—often pairs the Lovers' Knot tiara with Queen Elizabeth's Greville Diamond Chandelier Earrings, created by Cartier. The earrings were made in London in 1918 and modified over a period of 11 years, until 1929, when they were completed in the style seen up to the present day. No one could ever accuse the Princess of Wales of not being an immensely thoughtful dresser—and July 8 was no exception. In wearing Sarah Burton for Givenchy, she masterfully honored a British designer—Burton, who 14 years ago (while working with Alexander McQueen) designed Kate's own wedding dress—while also honoring a French fashion house. Earlier in the day, in wearing Dior, she again honored a French fashion house, one which recently named Jonathan Anderson—who hails from Northern Ireland—as its creative director.

Getty The red color of Kate's Givenchy gown was not only one of France's national colors, but her Givenchy clutch—embroidered with lily of the valley—was also symbolic. Per People, the flower “traditionally represents happiness, humility, and motherhood, and in France, it's gifted on May 1 (La Fête du Muguet) as a token of luck and renewal.” Tying it all up with a bow, Christian Dior considered lily of the valley “his lucky bloom, frequently incorporating it into his designs,” People reported. Last night, Kate also debuted her Royal Family Order of King Charles III, a badge featuring a miniature portrait of her father-in-law with a pale blue ribbon. Stone said it was “truly heartwarming” to see Kate honor her role as Princess of Wales by wearing the first tiara she chose in her current position, which he called “a beautiful symbol of continuity, respect, and royal heritage.”","Surprisingly, Kate Middleton has only had 15 tiara moments in her 14 years as a royal, since marrying into the royal family on April 29, 2011.

The earrings were made in London in 1918 and modified over a period of 11 years, until 1929, when they were completed in the style seen up to the present day. No one could ever accuse the Princess of Wales of not being an immensely thoughtful dresser—and July 8 was no exception. In wearing Sarah Burton for Givenchy, she masterfully honored a British designer—Burton, who 14 years ago (while working with Alexander McQueen) designed Kate's own wedding dress—while also honoring a French fashion house. Earlier in the day, in wearing Dior, she again honored a French fashion house, one which recently named Jonathan Anderson—who hails from Northern Ireland—as its creative director. (Northern Ireland, along with England, Scotland, and Wales, make up the United Kingdom.) Kate Middleton toasting at the French state banquet on July 8, 2025. Getty The red color of Kate's Givenchy gown was not only one of France's national colors, but her Givenchy clutch—embroidered with lily of the valley—was also symbolic. Per People, the flower “traditionally represents happiness, humility, and motherhood, and in France, it's gifted on May 1 (La Fête du Muguet) as a token of luck and renewal.” Tying it all up with a bow, Christian Dior considered lily of the valley “his lucky bloom, frequently incorporating it into his designs,” People reported. Last night, Kate also debuted her Royal Family Order of King Charles III, a badge featuring a miniature portrait of her father-in-law with a pale blue ribbon. Stone said it was “truly heartwarming” to see Kate honor her role as Princess of Wales by wearing the first tiara she chose in her current position, which he called “a beautiful symbol of continuity, respect, and royal heritage.”",2025-07-09 13:23:17,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"While the content is primarily about Kate Middleton's royal attire, it specifically mentions Givenchy in the context of her wearing a ""bespoke red Sarah Burton for Givenchy"" dress at a state banquet, which connects the brand to fashion and design.

The Princess of Wales opted for a design by Givenchy, with Queen Camilla favoring one of her go-to designers, Fiona Clare, and Macron styled a custom royal blue cape gown by Louis Vuitton for the special occasion. Middleton's bespoke Givenchy gown was designed by Sarah Burton, who also designed the British royal family member's ornate lace wedding gown worn to her Westminster nuptials to Prince William in April 2011. The Princess of Wales' gown featured flowing chiffon fabric, with a sleeveless design, cinched waist for added silhouette definition and an elegant skirt. The gown also featured a cape element over the British royal's shoulders. Middleton carried the Lily of the Valley Embroidered Evening Clutch courtesy of Givenchy. As for finishing touches and further accessories, she wore a pair of burgundy velvet pumps by Jimmy Choo and the Queen Mary's Lover's Knot Tiara and the Greville Chandelier Earrings (both from Queen Elizabeth II's personal collection). The tiara is estimated to be worth roughly $1.3 million, according to the experts at Steven Stone in London. The tiara was designed by Queen Mary and then passed on to her granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth II. Middleton also wore Princess Diana's three-strand pearl bracelet. Queen Camilla wore a Fiona Clare ivory silk gown with embroidery on the front of the skirt and at the hemline and sleeves. She also carried the 'Bella' clutch in silver by Launer London. As for her jewels, Queen Camilla wore the late Queen Elizabeth II's Belgian Sapphire Tiara. She coordinated the tiara with Queen Elizabeth II's matching sapphire and diamond cluster line necklace as well as the sapphire earrings. The tiara is estimated to be worth $6.79 million, while the necklace is valued at $5.4 million, and the earrings are estimated to be worth roughly $407,000, according to the experts at Steven Stone in London. Brigitte Macron wore a deep blue silk crepe column gown by Louis Vuitton that featured a cape effect similar to that of Middleton's dress. The shoulders of the dress also included hand-embroidered black and silver jewel embellishments. Macron accessorized her attire with jewels courtesy of the French luxury fashion house as well. The red, white and blue colorscape of Middleton, Queen Camilla and Macron's attire seemingly referenced the colors of both the French flag and the flag of the U.K., also known as the Union Jack, creating an overall unified statement. French President Emmanuel Macron began his three-day state visit to the U.K. on Monday, marking the first visit by a European Union leader since the U.K.'s departure from the European Union, commonly referred to as Brexit. The visit underscores efforts to renew ties between the two countries amid ongoing challenges such as migration across the English Channel and the war in Ukraine.

The 32-year-old English actor will portray the late London-born designer in the play ""House of McQueen"" by Darrah Cloud. The Off Broadway play is set to ""begin previews August 19 at The Mansion at Hudson Yards, with an official opening set for September 9,"" Deadline reported, with direction by Sam Helfrich.

""It is the story of a boy born in the east end of London, who literally wears his heart on his sleeve, never meant to rise beyond his working-class family,"" the description continues. ""From making doll clothes for his mother's friends to working in a tailor shop, he rises to the top of the fashion industry as chief designer for Givenchy and head of his own legendary fashion line, as his fashion shows become theatrical and artistic spectacles, attracting countless celebrities.""

McQueen became known for his low-rise jeans, called ""bumsters,"" as well as for his provocative designs and runway shows.

Amazon's mini Christmas in July has consumers clicking on fashion — and there are more apparel brands in the promotional mix, including vintage designer style from ReBag as well as looks from Michael Kors, Naadam and more. Prime Day, which extended to four days this year and ends on Friday, has become a fixture on the retail calendar, prompting competing deals from other retailers. Altogether, retailers are expected to see $23.8 billion in sales, or the equivalent of two Black Fridays, according to Adobe. At Amazon, the event has had a strong fashion start. Numerator is tracking the e-commerce giant's Prime Day take, studying the activity of shoppers at 22,411 households and surveying 2,248 buyers during the sale's first two days. Thirty percent of buyers snatched up Prime Day apparel and footwear — tying for the top spot with cleaning products and other household essentials, according to the data and tech company. But in keeping with the general sense of caution in the market, consumers are being very calculated as they spend. Fifty-one percent of shoppers bought items that they'd been waiting to buy on sale and 37 percent of shoppers bought the same items they typically buy on Amazon. Numerator pegged the average order size on Prime Day at $57.12 and said 51 percent of households have made two or more orders, upping the average household spend to $126.26. Two-thirds of the Prime Day items have sold for under $20 while only 3 percent are over $100. Amazon has been steadily adding to its fashion mix and a company spokesperson pointed to the slate of fashions making their Prime Day debut. For the first time, the luxury resale player Rebag is offering price promotions on looks from Alexander McQueen, Chloé, Delvaux, Givenchy, Jacquemus, Valentino Garavani, Versace and Tom Ford on Amazon.

Vanessa Kirby stepped into shine and structure for Thursday's London premiere of “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” wearing Aquazzura's Minute Sandal 105 in metallic silver — the latest entry in her sculptural maternity footwear streak.QUES The Italian-made stilettos featured mirrored leather uppers, two slim straps and a high, tapered heel. A back zip created a clean finish at the ankle, and the brand's signature gold plaque was visible on the sole. The 105mm silhouette added lift without disrupting the overall proportion. Related Stories Kirby paired the sandals with a beaded turquoise dress from Loewe's spring 2025 collection. The strapless midi-length look, styled by Andrew Mukamal, was constructed entirely of layered bead strands that created fringe-like movement across the body. The runway version featured a shorter hemline and metallic underlayer, but Kirby's custom iteration removed any lining to emphasize the vertical drape. Combined with the clean stiletto, the full look felt visually elongated. This marked Kirby's latest footwear-forward look on the “Fantastic Four: First Steps” press tour. Earlier this week in Paris, she wore metallic wraparound stilettos with a lilac Givenchy halter dress. In Mexico, she styled two different Manolo Blahnik silhouettes — including the black snakeskin Paloma heel — with cutout knits and a teal Schiaparelli gown. And at the Alabama trailer launch in February, she wore pointed PVC stilettos with vintage Versace. Across each appearance, Kirby has relied on heels with clean lines and exaggerated finishes — think eye-catching metallics, sheer panels and snakeskin — to ground dresses that range from architectural to body-conscious. “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” marks the Marvel franchise's official reboot under Disney, introducing a new cast led by Kirby, Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. Directed by Matt Shakman, the film serves as both an origin story and launchpad for the characters' integration into the broader MCU, ahead of their expected crossover appearances in “Avengers: Secret Wars.” The film opens in U.S. theaters on July 25. Read More","She paired the metallic heels with a beaded Loewe dress. Vanessa Kirby stepped into shine and structure for Thursday's London premiere of “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” wearing Aquazzura's Minute Sandal 105 in metallic silver — the latest entry in her sculptural maternity footwear streak.QUES The Italian-made stilettos featured mirrored leather uppers, two slim straps and a high, tapered heel. A back zip created a clean finish at the ankle, and the brand's signature gold plaque was visible on the sole. The 105mm silhouette added lift without disrupting the overall proportion. Related Stories Kirby paired the sandals with a beaded turquoise dress from Loewe's spring 2025 collection. The strapless midi-length look, styled by Andrew Mukamal, was constructed entirely of layered bead strands that created fringe-like movement across the body. The runway version featured a shorter hemline and metallic underlayer, but Kirby's custom iteration removed any lining to emphasize the vertical drape. Combined with the clean stiletto, the full look felt visually elongated. This marked Kirby's latest footwear-forward look on the “Fantastic Four: First Steps” press tour. Earlier this week in Paris, she wore metallic wraparound stilettos with a lilac Givenchy halter dress. In Mexico, she styled two different Manolo Blahnik silhouettes — including the black snakeskin Paloma heel — with cutout knits and a teal Schiaparelli gown. And at the Alabama trailer launch in February, she wore pointed PVC stilettos with vintage Versace.

主催するパリ・オートクチュール組合の公式カレンダー上では、今季は昨シーズンの28から1つ減の27ブランドが参加。 「ディオール（DIOR）」や「ヴァレンティノ（VALENTINO）」、ジャン・ポール・ゴルチエのクチュールライン、「ゴルチエ パリ（GAULTIER PARIS）」等がコレクションを発表せず、久々に「アデリーヌ アンドレ（Adeline André）」等が参加するなどの増減が見られた。 その「ゴルチエ パリ」は、毎シーズン、注目度の高いデザイナーを迎えてコレクションを発表していたが、前回のルドヴィック・サン・セルナンによるコレクションをもってゲスト・デザイナー制は終了。 今年4月に、デュラン・ランティックがパーマネントなアーティスティック・ディレクターに就任。 9月のレディースコレクションに向けて始動し、来年の1月にはオートクチュール・コレクションの発表も予定されているという。 今季のトピックは、何よりも「メゾン マルジェラ（Maison Margiela）」と「バレンシアガ（BALENCIAGA）」だった。 ジョン・ガリアーノが去り、クリエイティブ・ディレクターにマルタン・マルジェラと同郷のベルギー人、グレン・マーティンスが着任した「メゾン マルジェラ」。 マーティンスが「Y/プロジェクト（Y/PROJECT）」で見せていたシュールレアリスティックな手法が、「メゾン マルジェラ」でどのような化学反応を引き起こすのか、大いに注目を集めた。 一方の、デムナによる最終コレクションとなった「バレンシアガ」は、オートクチュール会期中に終了したデムナの懐古作品展「Balenciaga by Demna」と共にメモリアルなものとなった。 来季は、ピエールパオロ・ピッチョーリによる「バレンシアガ」、ジョナサン・アンダーソンによる「ディオール」、マチュー・ブラジによる「シャネル（CHANEL）」、サラ・バートンによる　「ジバンシィ（GIVENCHY）」、そしてデュラン・ランティックによる「ゴルチエ パリ」と、全て出揃うかは現時点で不明ではあるものの、期待値の高いシーズンとなりそうである。 シャネル（CHANEL） Courtesy of CHANEL 今季もクリエイション・スタジオによるコレクションを、グラン・パレにて披露した「シャネル」。 ガブリエル・シャネルが度々イメージソースにして来たイギリスの田園風景や、スコットランドの荒野にインスパイアされた。 アイボリーやブラウン、グリーン、ブラックなどナチュラルなカラーパレットで構成。 ガブリエル・シャネルが好み、ファインジュエリーでも度々登場する麦穂のモチーフが随所にあしらわれ、自然の要素を滲ませた。 フランスでは、麦穂は豊穣の象徴としてのラッキーチャーム。 刺繍を施したツイードのドレスでスタートしたが、シンプルでマニッシュな印象。 ガブリエル・シャネルがメンズのスーツからインスパイアされて、「シャネルスーツ」を編み出したことを想起させた。 羽を飾ったケープにもツイードのメンズライクなワンピースを合わせ、ニーハイブーツをコーディネートしてモダンで若々しいスタイリングに。 チェーンを飾った黒のツイードのセットアップは、甲冑のような力強さを見せる。 麦穂のテクスチャーを思わせるツイードのブルゾンには、シルクサテンのドレープスカートを合わせて、スポーティでマスキュリンなアイテムに敢えてフェミニンなアイテムを組み合わせてコントラストを見せる。 フリンジをあしらったセットアップやワンピースも、フォルムはシンプルでマニッシュな印象。 シルクサテンのロングドレスにも、羽を刺繍してファーのように仕立てたメンズコートをコーディネートして、マスキュリン・フェミニンに。 ラグランスリーブのカーディガン風のツイードジャケットには、プリーツシフォンのスカートを合わせ、適度なカジュアルさを演出。 フェミニンなドレス一辺倒にするのではなく、敢えてマスキュリン・スポーティに仕上げて、ウルトラモダンなクチュールの世界観を描いて見せていた。 メゾン マルジェラ（Maison Margiela） Courtesy of Maison Margiela 文化複合施設である104（サン・キャートル）を会場に、オートクチュールと同等に扱われるアーティザナルコレクションのショーを開催した、新任のグレン・マーティンスによる「メゾン マルジェラ」。 104は、2008年9月にマルタン・マルジェラ本人による最終コレクションが発表された場所で、今季は全てのモデルにマスクが合わせられたことからも、オリジナルへのオマージュ・リスペクトを印象付けた。 今季は、フランドル地方の中世建築からインスパイア。 ゴシック建築に見られる彫像や教会に飾られる聖人たちの彫像、北ヨーロッパのルネッサンス期の邸宅のインテリア、16世紀のフランドル地方のエンボスによるレザーの壁紙、象徴主義の画家ギュスターヴ・モローの作品などにイメージを求め、ベルギー出身のデザイナーらしいダークかつ耽美な世界観を披露している。 透明のプラスチックドレスでスタート。 インナーに同素材のコルセットを合わせ、脚元にはアクリルウェッジソールの「タビ」サンダル。 ギュスターヴ・モローの筆致を思わせるハンドペイントを施したストレッチサテンのセットアップにも、プラスチックのプラストロンをコーディネート。 16世紀のフランドル地方のレザー製壁紙のモチーフをプリントした、金属糸を織り込んだファブリックによるドレスは、ハートの形にシェイプされ、ドラマティックな一点となった。 アップサイクルされたバイカージャケットにも、16世紀のフランドル地方のレザー製型紙のパターンをコピーした紙を貼り付け、敢えて朽ち果てて行く様を表現。 17世紀のオランダの静物画に登場する羽のイメージをプリントしたファブリックをカットアップして繋いだスカートや、アップサイクルされたヴィンテージのネックレスを繋いだニットドレス、17世紀のオランダの静物画に描かれた花をプリントして花をカットして縫い付けたプラスチックのコート。 そのどれもがこのブランドらしいシュールレアリスティックな手法に則っている。 アップサイクルされた素材をあしらうというコンセプトを守りつつ、より手の込んだ徹底した作品作りの姿勢を見せていた。 ジョルジオ アルマーニ プリヴェ（GIORGIO ARMANI PRIVÉ） Courtesy of Giorgio Armani／Photo by Marie-Laure Dutel Israël 「ジョルジオ アルマーニ プリヴェ」は、今年に入ってフランソワ1世通りにオープンさせたパラッツォ・アルマーニにてオートクチュール・コレクションを発表。 ブラックを主軸に据えて、黒というベーシックカラーが持つ究極のエレガンスを表現した。 夜をイメージさせるブルーを差し色にしたテイラードでスタート。 ブロケードや膨れ織り、デボレなど、凹凸感ある素材使いがこのブランドらしい。 プリント地に刺繍を施して絵画的に仕上げたジャケットや、花びらを散らしたような総刺繍のジャケット、抽象画のような刺繍のトップスとテクノ素材のスカートのセットアップなど、一つの時代やスタイルにこだわらない、バリエーション豊かな作品が並ぶ。...,SPR_COMBO[ja]写真左から「シャネル」「バレンシアガ」「メゾン マルジェラ」 「ジョルジオ アルマーニ プリヴェ」

インナーに同素材のコルセットを合わせ、脚元にはアクリルウェッジソールの「タビ」サンダル。 ギュスターヴ・モローの筆致を思わせるハンドペイントを施したストレッチサテンのセットアップにも、プラスチックのプラストロンをコーディネート。 16世紀のフランドル地方のレザー製壁紙のモチーフをプリントした、金属糸を織り込んだファブリックによるドレスは、ハートの形にシェイプされ、ドラマティックな一点となった。 アップサイクルされたバイカージャケットにも、16世紀のフランドル地方のレザー製型紙のパターンをコピーした紙を貼り付け、敢えて朽ち果てて行く様を表現。 17世紀のオランダの静物画に登場する羽のイメージをプリントしたファブリックをカットアップして繋いだスカートや、アップサイクルされたヴィンテージのネックレスを繋いだニットドレス、17世紀のオランダの静物画に描かれた花をプリントして花をカットして縫い付けたプラスチックのコート。 そのどれもがこのブランドらしいシュールレアリスティックな手法に則っている。 アップサイクルされた素材をあしらうというコンセプトを守りつつ、より手の込んだ徹底した作品作りの姿勢を見せていた。 ジョルジオ アルマーニ プリヴェ（GIORGIO ARMANI PRIVÉ） Courtesy of Giorgio Armani／Photo by Marie-Laure Dutel Israël 「ジョルジオ アルマーニ プリヴェ」は、今年に入ってフランソワ1世通りにオープンさせたパラッツォ・アルマーニにてオートクチュール・コレクションを発表。 ブラックを主軸に据えて、黒というベーシックカラーが持つ究極のエレガンスを表現した。 夜をイメージさせるブルーを差し色にしたテイラードでスタート。 ブロケードや膨れ織り、デボレなど、凹凸感ある素材使いがこのブランドらしい。 プリント地に刺繍を施して絵画的に仕上げたジャケットや、花びらを散らしたような総刺繍のジャケット、抽象画のような刺繍のトップスとテクノ素材のスカートのセットアップなど、一つの時代やスタイルにこだわらない、バリエーション豊かな作品が並ぶ。...,2025-07-12 10:38:03,ja,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"The text mentions Givenchy in the
