n12csio,"  I don't pay for chat gpt premium , but I use the free version and was curious what answer I'd get. It's a little different than yours. I only used the 2nd pic The image shows what appears to be droppings and chewed wood or insulation debris inside a cabinet or piece of furniture. The black, pellet-like droppings suggest the possible presence of rodents (likely mice) or insects such as cockroaches. Possible Issues: •Rodent Activity (Most Likely): •Droppings resemble mouse feces—small, black, and pellet-shaped. •Gnaw marks on wood and scattered debris are consistent with rodent nesting/feeding behavior. •Other Possible Pests: •Large cockroach infestations can also leave similar droppings, though usually glossier and with ridged ends. Actions You Should Take: 1. Clean & Disinfect Area: Wear gloves and a mask, and use a disinfectant. 2. Inspect Nearby Areas: Look for food sources, nesting materials, and entry points. 3.

The black, pellet-like droppings suggest the possible presence of rodents (likely mice) or insects such as cockroaches. Possible Issues: •Rodent Activity (Most Likely): •Droppings resemble mouse feces—small, black, and pellet-shaped. •Gnaw marks on wood and scattered debris are consistent with rodent nesting/feeding behavior. •Other Possible Pests: •Large cockroach infestations can also leave similar droppings, though usually glossier and with ridged ends. Actions You Should Take: 1. Clean & Disinfect Area: Wear gloves and a mask, and use a disinfectant. 2. Inspect Nearby Areas: Look for food sources, nesting materials, and entry points. 3. Seal Entry Points: Use steel wool or caulk for cracks and gaps. 4. Set Traps: Snap traps or bait stations can confirm if rodents are present. 5.

I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference! Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me.

1ls7lxs,"  I want to share a fragrance grieveance story of mine. I absolutely adore Cherry Ambition by The 7 Virtues. Looove the opening of this dark boozy but still juicy cherry and on paper I also really like the drydown. It reminds me of Angel's Share but for some reason spicy fragrances with a lot of notes go super dusty and powdery and overwhelming on my skin 🥲🥲 same thing happens with Angel's share where the drydown just smells like an oberwhelming powdery mess on me. I wore Cherry Ambition again yesterday and unfortunately after an hour, it just smells like I'm putting my nose into a dusty old makeup bag which I hate. So I think I'll have to sell it and it makes me really sad cause I love everything about The 7 Virtues and own many of their fragrances (Santal Vanille is my signature scent and I also have Amber Vanilla, Coconut Sun & Vetiver Elemi). So now I'm looking into cherry perfumes that can replace it and don't turn so powdery & dusty on me. I'd love a juicy or creamy cherry or even musky. Currently on my list to try: Clean Reserve Whipped Cherry, Kayali Lovefest Burning Cherry, Dolce & Gabbana Q, Sabrina Carpenter Cherry Baby - would love to hear your thoughts on those fragrances and if any of you have a similar problem with perfumes turning overwhelmingly powdery on skin.

I didn't knowwhat to do, but I was being drawn to her, the tether from earlier pulling at me even harder.

Her lips parted, but she said nothing. I could see the ghost of the word 'fake 'on them. I gripped the railing tighter. “I never wanted any of this to be pretend. Not one second of it has been for me. Has it been for you?” She shook her head methodically, as if knowing what she was unleashing, and my lips curved upward at her response. Especially when her body gravitated toward mine like she couldn't stand to be apart.

The first time, nothing would be covered up under the guise of Louis 'plan. “Luna, why did you write One More Hour? Was what you said on stage true?” I asked with urgency. But her face said it all.

It differs in the fact that it is not sponsored by the brand nor do the creators have any monetary gains to make from the content they have produced. And a lot of brands are now leveraging these user generated content pieces in their individual marketing efforts. This could be because UGC is known to be 20% more influential than any other type of media when it comes to driving Millennial's purchasing decisions. In this blog we are going to quickly look at some leading brands that are using user generated content and winning the marketing game. And learn from their tactics to implement in our own initiatives and efforts. **Why UGC Matters: The Power of Customer-Generated Content** Did you know that content created by real people greatly sways purchasing choices across age groups? Over 79% of individuals are influenced by it and 93% find it extremely helpful! That is a massive number. And not one that must be ignored if you want to make use of the content your users and audience have created for you. But that is not all. User generated content isn't just more trustworthy, it is a lot helpful for boosting SEO factors as well. Because UGC tends to unknowingly incorporate long tail keywords, specific facts and figures, and candid content that search engines like Google favour for being unbiased and human written content.

It rose in the '90s when R&B got glossier, faster — and some of us craved slowness. Depth. Groove. Truth. So artists like D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Maxwell, Lauryn Hill, and Jill Scott reached back — to vinyl, to jazz, to gospel — and breathed it forward. Neo Soul is a bridge. Between roots and now.

This award-winning, multi-tasking styling product has built a cult following for one reason: it delivers sleek, glassy, frizz-proof hair that lasts for days no matter the weather. What sets Dream Coat apart is that it's not just another anti-frizz spray.

I'd pretty much accepted that unless I was heading to a hairdresser, my dreams of fully, bouncy hair were doomed. That was until I tried Philip Kingsley's Body Building collection. I'd heard good things, but after using the products consistently for a couple of weeks, they truly transformed my locks, making them look and feel fuller, glossier, and healthier. The good news is the Body Building set, which includes travel sizes of shampoo, conditioner, root-boosting spray, and plumping cream, is currently reduced to £19.50 from £25 for Amazon Prime Day. It's the perfect chance to try the range without committing to the full-size price tag, especially for those cautious about spending money on products that mightn't work for them. Plus, a wider selection of Philip Kingsley products are also discounted for Prime Day. That includes the full-sized Body Building Shampoo and Conditioner (£37.50 from £49), making it a good time to try the range or stock up on favourites. Philip Kingsley Body-Building Volumizing Collection Shop the sale The haircare set includes the Body Building Shampoo (75ml), Body Building Conditioner (75ml), Maximiser Root Boosting Spray (60ml), and Maximiser Strand Plumping Cream (20ml). £19.50 Amazon Of course, Philip Kingsley isn't the only brand offering volumising solutions. Living Proof's Full Shampoo and Conditioner (£52, Cult Beauty) are cult favourites for a reason, promising weightless volume and softness without build-up. Otherwise, Color Wow's Raise the Root Spray (£16.13, Look Fantastic) is another bestseller, adding serious lift without making hair feel sticky or stiff. Plus, it's also a favourite among celebrity stylists (Kim Kardashian's hairdresser is reportedly a fan). Back to Philip Kingsley, the first thing I noticed was its sleek packaging and scent - it looks like something you'd find in a luxury salon, and the products smell fresh and clean without being overpowering. The shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling soft and nourished, although it wasn't until I added the Root Boosting Spray and Strand Boosting Cream that I saw the real transformation. The spray gave my roots a lightweight lift that lasted, with no crisp or crunchy texture - just natural bounce. And while the plumping cream required some trial and error (use a small amount unless you want sticky strands), it made styling significantly easier.

To take two humble, yet beloved, Malaysian Chinese staples and elevate them into a symphony of flavors worthy of a Michelin star, while maintaining their comforting essence. This is not merely a combination; it is a re-imagination, a culinary alchemy.

We'll extract the soul of the ingredients, refine them, and present them in a harmonious ballet of taste and texture. **Concept:** A crystal-clear, deeply flavorful consommé derived from the ABC soup ingredients, infused with subtle sweetness and richness from fresh corn, and finished with delicate, pearl-like corn textures and a nuanced umami depth. **Yields:** 6 servings **Prep time:** 45 minutes **Cook time:** 3 hours (plus overnight chilling for consommé) ### **Ingredients:** **For the Golden Harvest Consommé:** * 1 kg free-range chicken bones (back, wings, feet – for collagen) * 500g pork neck bones (for richness and sweetness) * 2 large organic carrots, peeled and roughly chopped * 2 medium organic potatoes, peeled and roughly chopped * 1 large Spanish onion, quartered * 2 ripe vine-ripened tomatoes, quartered * 1 ear of fresh sweet corn, kernels removed, cob reserved * 2-3 slices fresh ginger * 2.5 liters filtered water * 1 tsp sea salt (or to taste) * 1/2 tsp white peppercorns * 1 bay leaf **For the Silken Corn Pearls & Umami Essence:** * 2 ears of fresh sweet corn, kernels removed (approximately 2 cups) * 100ml high-quality chicken stock (from the consommé, if desired) * 50ml full-cream milk (organic preferred) * 1 tbsp unsalted butter, cold * 1/4 tsp white pepper * Pinch of sea salt * 1 tsp white truffle oil (optional, for an extra layer of luxury) * 2-3 sprigs fresh chervil or microgreens, for garnish **For the Umami Garnishes (optional but highly recommended for depth):** * 20g dried shiitake mushrooms, rehydrated and finely diced * 1 tbsp rendered Iberico ham fat (or high-quality bacon fat), finely diced for crisping * Small handful of finely chopped spring onion greens (for freshness) ### **Method:** **Part 1: The Golden Harvest Consommé (The Soul of the Soup)** 1. **Blanch the Bones:** In a large stockpot, place the chicken and pork bones.

mov_C0CF534DF6465BFA525F27FE361F2C63,"  Thomas Unger has made the unconventional choice to paint with coffee and motor oil. Courtesy Thomas Unger Like a lot of people, Thomas Unger is pretty particular about his coffee. How it tastes is important, but the Houston artist's principal interest is how it works as a painting medium. “I use brewed coffee sometimes, but mostly instant coffee,” he told Observer, mixing it with water until it reaches the right consistency for him to paint with. Darker grounds produce deeper and glossier browns, while a somewhat more watery slurry generates tans. Then, he starts painting on either thick watercolor paper or canvas that has been primed with motor oil. Again, he is pretty particular about the oil, preferring Pennzoil. “I use a mixture of used oil—carbon deposits make it darker, new oil and graphite powder,” he said. Unger doesn't go into why an artist might use coffee grounds and motor oil when watercolor paints and commercial primers already do the job satisfactorily, but perhaps the fact that his artistic sideline—he's a lieutenant in the U.S. Coast Guard—is called “CarsinCoffee” is reason enough. He is part of a small but notable group of artists who create works using nontraditional materials or use traditional mediums in nontraditional ways. Creatively stepping away from tried-and-true materials and techniques can result in unique output but may also create what art conservators call “inherent vices”—a flaw or defect that will cause an artwork to deteriorate. Unger asserted that his painting surfaces are stable and do not smell of oil, although some have a “pleasant” coffee aroma. Sometimes unconventional mediums just work. Artist Kiki Smith told Observer she “once had blood removed from my veins with a syringe and made drawings with it. I don't think there have been any conservation issues.” That's not always the case, however, and art conservators face challenges of all types. Ellen Moody, conservator of contemporary art at the Getty Conservation Institute in California, told Observer that she has worked on pieces made from chocolate (Dieter Roth), hair gel (Anicka Yi), milk and ketchup (Pope.L), epoxy and dried corn (Fernando Mastrangelo) and even a living beehive (Pierre Huyghe). SEE ALSO: Angelo Sotira Wants to Set the Standard for Displaying Code-Based Art Jackson Pollock used paint on canvas, but he used industrial paints such as house paint and automotive lacquers rather than more traditional artists' paints. “These paints were never designed for flexible supports and can become brittle and flake over time,” Moody explained. Her first job, after determining what she is dealing with, is to “stabilize the surface by introducing a suitable adhesive beneath partially detached areas, often using a syringe, then gently re-adhering and securing the flakes. We then tone the losses with materials that are stable, reversible and distinguishable under examination methods such as U.V. light.” It's not all bad news. She added that “many artworks using unconventional materials have aged surprisingly well. David Hammons' 1970s works incorporating grease, hair and chicken bones are a great example—they remain in good condition, likely due to careful construction and stable environments.” But not every experimental artist is as fortunate. In the late 1970s, Andy Warhol created a series of what he called “Oxidation Paintings” that involved studio assistants urinating and ejaculating on canvases prepared with copper-based metallic paints, which caused a chemical reaction resulting in abstract images of different colors. Urine, which is somewhat acidic, contributed to the oxidation and patina but did not eat through the canvas. “From my experience, if kept in the right environment, they are quite stable, but any high humidity can cause irreversible changes,” Suzanne Siano, a conservator in New York City, told Observer, adding that “the dried pee liquifies and runs down the work.” Urine also smells, but in the intervening years any odor has largely gone away. “A few piss paintings that were left after Warhol died that the foundation had me treat did smell of pee because they were stored in a drawer for many years, but I suspect that the smell has dissipated now that they are out in the air.” While the “piss paintings” (as they are often called) are in several major public collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney, the Tate in London and the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, those that used semen as a material (the “cum paintings”) are all stored at the Warhol Museum and generally are not on view. More recently, artist Dan Colen has produced numerous paintings that use, instead of paint, flowers, Hubba Bubba bubble gum, bird poop, tar and feathers. Siano, who has worked on many of Colen's artworks, told Observer that one of the first issues she dealt with was building stronger stretchers since the material on these canvases was far too heavy for the supports to hold. The chewing gum created separate problems, as pieces began oozing color and just falling off. The long-term prospects for these paintings were not part of his thinking, and Colen side-stepped the conservation issues of his work, noting that “my paintings are about the things they are made of.” Damien Hirst with one of his formaldehyde sharks at White Cube in London in 2007. CHRIS YOUNG/AFP via In 1991, British artist Damien Hirst acquired a preserved tiger shark that he submerged in a glass tank of water and formaldehyde, titling it The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living. The level of formaldehyde in the tank was not sufficient, and within a dozen years, the shark began to deteriorate and the water became murky, requiring the artist to replace the shark with another and to submerge it in a solution with a higher formaldehyde content. (As to whether it's still the same artwork, Hirst called the question “a big dilemma.”) Sometimes, artists just have to throw up their hands and consign an artwork to the trash bin. Painter Tom Christopher once used “roofing tar on a piece as a background. It eventually hardened, and chunks fell off.” He let the buyer pick a work from his inventory as a replacement. Norwegian painter Odd Nerdrum had to do the same when an unconventional medium from one of his paintings detached from the canvas. A redo is rare in the art field, however. More often, artists do the best they can. British artist Chris Ofili applied some concoction to the elephant dung pedestals used to hold up some of his paintings to eliminate the smell, but still, those “pedestals were breaking apart and needed to be stabilized,” Kelly O'Neill, an art conservator in New York City, told Observer....","Thomas Unger has made the unconventional choice to paint with coffee and motor oil.

mov_C385BD44FF25FF28A9B61E0D81B2612F,"  At first glance, the numbers look super solid. The latest MST Marquee retail summary shows that online retail is still growing and up 8.1 per cent, year on year, overall, with online food surging by 14.4 per cent and non-food rising by 5.3 per cent. Over A$4.3 billion moved through Australian digital checkouts in May 2025 alone. An amazing story at first glance, and these are the kind of stats that normally signal great health and ongoing momentum, digital stability and operational confidence. But if you zoom out just slightly, not on the numbers, but on the shape of the trend, we start to see something else. The growth curve is flattening and has been since mid-2023. Not falling. Not failing. Just plateauing quietly and steadily. We can confidently say this isn't a logistics problem, and that it's not a tech constraint. It's certainly not consumer fatigue with digital convenience. What we're seeing is something more human, deeper and way more strategic. We've almost hit the emotional ceiling of online retail. We trust online now, job done but in turn we don't feel anything about it. The explosion of e-commerce over the past 10 years was fundamentally built on the back of three simple things: convenience, speed and access. It delivered exactly what it promised (most of the time): fast transactions, low friction and a product on your doorstep. That's amazing, right? Today, the promise has been met. The infrastructure is there. Logistics are predictable, and consumers trust the process. But what's not being recognised is that trust has quietly shifted into indifference. There's no magic left in a 'delivered' notification. No spark of emotion in the checkout journey. No wonder or assisted discovery in the scroll. In fact, we're seeing a version of what I'd call the Uber Effect, which is that moment when a once-amazing innovation becomes background noise. Invisible. Assumed and expected. There goes the surprise and delight. And why is this a problem? Because people don't fall in love with what they trust. They fall in love with what moves them. What excites, surprises or grounds them. Function alone doesn't build any memories. Emotion does. For some time, we thought personalisation was going to be the answer. But it's more than that if we think further ahead. What we need is presence. In response to stagnation, many brands have doubled down on personalisation, which is great, and I'm definitely not knocking that approach. We have behavioural tracking, AI-based recommendations and dynamic content served by data. All of it aimed at relevance. But relevance without soul is just noise that fits. Consumers are craving more than just being understood by the algorithm; they want to be acknowledged. To be met. To feel like a brand is genuinely present in their moment and not just watching their clicks. This is going to be the next evolution of digital experience: presence over personalisation. Presence is about emotional timing. It's the right word at the right moment. The brand that seems to know what mood I'm in and not just what product I'm likely to buy. It's not the offer that is going to convert, but the energy that connects. And energy is the one thing missing from most digital storefronts....","At first glance, the numbers look super solid.

mov_7FE93565C69463F9982026C220C618F9,"  The Girls writer's new semi-autobiographical romcom is silly, touching - and world's away from the series that made her famous cancel email X WhatsApp Facebook link share Share bookmark Save share cancel email X WhatsApp Facebook link bookmark I wouldn't like to be Lena Dunham today. Eight years after her seminal, groundbreaking series Girls came to an end, her second-ever original TV show has finally arrived on Netflix (2018's Camping doesn't count – it was an American recreation of the British series created by Julia Davis). The pressure to recreate her own magic must be immense. But she needn't worry. With Too Much she's done it again. This romcom is a semi-autobiographical fictionalisation of how Dunham met and fell in love with her husband, English musician – and co-creator of the series – Luis Felber. This version of Dunham is Jessica, played by Megan Stalter, whose acerbic social media parody skits (an influencer pretending to be invited to a Charli XCX party; a business owner during Pride Month: “hi gay!”) landed her a role in the much-lauded sitcom Hacks. When we meet her in New York, Jessica is heartbroken and furious when she finds out her ex-boyfriend has started dating stunning influencer Wendy (Emily Ratajkowski). So when her boss (Girls alumnus Andrew Rannells) – who also happens to be the ex-husband of her sister (played by Dunham herself) – offers her a job in London, she jumps at the chance. But Jessica doesn't find the period drama, Jane Austen world she imagined; it turns out she has sorely misunderstood what an “estate” is. When she meets Felix (Will Sharpe) at a grotty pub's open mic night, the pair click almost immediately. He might be a walking red flag – he's a flailing musician with a precarious living arrangement, a historic drug addiction and a strained relationship with his family – but Jessica isn't exactly a catch, either. She's very self-absorbed, obnoxiously loud and works her way through her breakup by filming furious videos addressed to Wendy on a private social media account. Despite their flaws – or maybe because of them – Too Much is one of the most honest, realistic depictions of a modern romance I've ever seen. The grit of Girls is gone, but Dunham's talent for finding the truth in messy relationships shines through. There is the requisite fish-out-of-water transatlantic confusion (being given “a bollocking” can sound quite rude if you don't know what it means), but it's quickly done away with for something much deeper as the pair learn that sharing their traumas – as opposed to burying them and letting it explode in one another's faces – brings them closer. If that sounds a bit, well, too much, don't worry, the romcom never loses its sense of fun. From Rita Ora dressed as a fat Santa to Jessica having to shimmy her way down a drainpipe after getting locked in the toilet at a posh wedding, gleeful silliness can be found in each one of the 10 episodes. But the real marvel here is the performances. Stalter might grate on some, but that's entirely the point of her character – confident and capable yet neurotically dramatic. After a while, you'll find yourself warming to her shouty American-ness. Sharpe is a revelation as Felix, mumbling his way through Dunham's script with heartbreaking pathos and nonchalance that anyone who has been on a date with an edgy straight man will recognise. They're supported by an impressive rota of actors: Richard E Grant, Rhea Perlman, Rita Wilson, Stephen Fry, Andrew Scott and Naomi Watts are just a handful of the recognisable faces who pitch up. Surely a sign of the pull power Dunham has in the industry. It might be about a young woman finding her way in the world, but Too Much is a far cry from Girls. It's a little glossier, a little happier and not nearly as bold, moving the focus away from friendship to romantic love. But judged on its own merits, this romcom is a special slice of hopefulness that we have only seen glimpses of from Dunham in the past.

Eight years after her seminal, groundbreaking series Girls came to an end, her second-ever original TV show has finally arrived on Netflix (2018's Camping doesn't count – it was an American recreation of the British series created by Julia Davis). The pressure to recreate her own magic must be immense. But she needn't worry. With Too Much she's done it again. This romcom is a semi-autobiographical fictionalisation of how Dunham met and fell in love with her husband, English musician – and co-creator of the series – Luis Felber. This version of Dunham is Jessica, played by Megan Stalter, whose acerbic social media parody skits (an influencer pretending to be invited to a Charli XCX party; a business owner during Pride Month: “hi gay!”) landed her a role in the much-lauded sitcom Hacks. When we meet her in New York, Jessica is heartbroken and furious when she finds out her ex-boyfriend has started dating stunning influencer Wendy (Emily Ratajkowski). So when her boss (Girls alumnus Andrew Rannells) – who also happens to be the ex-husband of her sister (played by Dunham herself) – offers her a job in London, she jumps at the chance. But Jessica doesn't find the period drama, Jane Austen world she imagined; it turns out she has sorely misunderstood what an “estate” is. When she meets Felix (Will Sharpe) at a grotty pub's open mic night, the pair click almost immediately. He might be a walking red flag – he's a flailing musician with a precarious living arrangement, a historic drug addiction and a strained relationship with his family – but Jessica isn't exactly a catch, either.

601fbcca14913714c73c4c92fb1e2e72,"  Several months ago, I attended a BBQ- yes, we occasionally have clement weather in the Wairarapa in late Autumn. I talked to a High School teacher about career prospects for her students. During the conversation, she asked what advice I would give to her students concerning education and career paths they may be contemplating. Presumably, she considered the grey hairs amongst the blond as a sign of accumulated wisdom. The problem with this presumption can be summed up by an old adage: 'There is no fool like an old fool'. Anyway, even though the question belongs to the devil himself, I decided to rise to the challenge and was promptly arrested- this last bit didn't happen. So here goes Flaxen's perceived wisdom after nearly 70 years as a sentient being (Not a ferret) . First, it is impossible to compare the current 'life' situation with when I was eighteen, 51 years ago. The world has undoubtedly changed beyond comparison, socially, economically, technologically, geopolitically and industrially, and these changes have radically impacted the job market, and not necessarily to the good. At 16, I was about to graduate from High School (Stew Pony Secondary Modern). At that time, the British educational system was split into two categories: Secondary Modern and Grammar schools. Grammar schools were designed for pupils considering university training, while secondary modern schools focused on less academic careers. Regardless, most students in my class contemplated entering the trades, such as electricians, plumbers, builders, etc. And of those who applied, the vast majority managed to enter into an apprenticeship of their choice. O ne of my friends applied for a diesel mechanics apprenticeship while another became a draughtsman. Two other, older friends of mine job-hopped with ease. Admittedly, the jobs were basic, unskilled manual factory work. They obtained three jobs in one week and finally settled for Monk's pie factory, Brumagen. The point is that jobs and training programmes were plentiful. In addition, those exiting Grammar School education at 18 with A levels were qualified to enter the 'Hallowed Halls of Education', commonly known as universities. There, they could seek more cerebral pursuits and study toward a degree. At the time, about 5% of the UK population went forth to higher education. Contrast that with today's statistics, where 36.4% (2024 UK data) of pupils seek a university education. Universities are no longer venerable and venerated institutions of higher learning. Universities are thriving businesses touting degree courses to clueless students, knowing full well that the job prospects for vast swaths of students are grim. No matter how many students are engaged in useless degrees, the more that do, the more money the university makes. So, they produce glossy brochures exhorting the career prospects for students graduating with a Gender Studies degree. The secret: Any degree containing the word 'studies' is a scam. Al so, the glossier the brochure, the worse the prospects for a job, unless you really want that McDonald's position; students, take note. So what advice can I offer those fresh-faced and earnest 18-year-olds contemplating critical life choices? First, a fundamental truth needs to be stated boldly. University is not the giggle it once was. There is no 'free' ride as experienced by the 'Golden One'. Loans are required for expensive tuition and living expenses, and interestingly, fees have increased exponentially since the 70s- funny that. A degree circa 1970s was a passport to the professions, even those deemed useless today. Employers considered it a stamp on your academic respectability. Of course, entry and success in the best, as in high-paying, vocational professions have always been ring-fenced. Anecdote time: Entry into medical school in the UK has always been difficult and required the highest exam results. In the 70s, I worked as a trainee in a biochemistry laboratory. One day, I became involved in a casual conversation with a colleague. The individual had recently graduated from high school and was working in the lab for a year before attending medical school. Generally, three A levels at grade A are required to gain admission to med school in the UK. As the conversation developed, my erstwhile colleague let it be known that he had gained three A levels with the commonplace grade of three Cs. Usually, the bearer of such results would be ineligible for entry, especially in the prestigious Birmingham University Medical School. He eventually proffered the information that his father was Head of the Medical School- the scales fell from my eyes. The story underlies a vital life lesson: Life is easier with connections, and specific, usually high-paying professions have a tendency to be inherited. Let's drive the point in further and take a look at the uncontroversial figure of Hunter Biden. He passed the Bar in 1996 after a stint at Yale. He subsequently entered the gravy train and held multiple positions with varied financial returns, including consultancy, lobbyist, co-founder of various firms, and executive vice president.

mov_5F40130AA48D0370E808EAC950789558,"  On 10th August 1979, what started as a reasonable demand by electricians at Thames Television to renegotiate an unsatisfactory proposed pay increase resulted in a mass walkout at fourteen of ITV's fifteen regional broadcasters, effectively taking the entire network off the air for a whopping eleven weeks. For the best part of three months, viewers desperate to find out what Sapphire And Steel were up to at that haunted railway station were greeted with nothing more than a static white on blue IBA slide bluntly stating that “we are sorry that programmes have been interrupted – there is an industrial dispute – transmissions will start again as soon as possible”. While the unaffected Channel Television gamely ploughed ahead, doubtless resorting to deploying week-long instalments of Puffin's Pla(i)ce, bereft ITV viewers reputedly to the tune of one million kept that slide on their screens in the vain hope that Bobby Ball might suddenly appear and exclaim “Normality resumed, Tommy!” . Those with something approaching a shred of sense, however, elected to switch over to the BBC. Fortunately for the BBC, by accident rather than by any kind of design they happened to have an impressive line-up of potential hits ready and waiting for their unanticipated influx of new viewers. David Attenborough's stunningly photographed history of evolution Life On Earth and Penelope Keith's new sitcom vehicle To The Manor Born both found a massive and hugely receptive audience and record viewing figures that they might not have met with otherwise; the former's lavishly illustrated tie-in book repeatedly sold out as the present-giving season approached, while viewers followed Audrey Fforbes-Hamilton's downsized will-they-won't-they antagonism with Grantleigh Manor's new owner Richard DeVere as if it was a ratings-dominating soap opera storyline. The BBC had been trailing behind ITV's glossier and more expensive Saturday afternoon imports for years, but suddenly The Dukes Of Hazzard and The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries were inspiring a million playground games involving pitch-perfect replications of the General Lee's horn and Pamela Sue Martin's running then stopping and looking round nervously then running again acting. A reasonable hit on its inaugural outing earlier in the year, full-tilt celebrity trash game show Blankety Blank became must-watch much-loved laugh riot appointment viewing virtually overnight. Over in Studio 6 of Television Centre, with the first recording block for The Nightmare Of Eden about to commence, the Doctor Who production team must surely have been following events with keen interest, especially in the knowledge that they already had a long overdue return appearance by the Daleks and another story filmed almost entirely in Paris under their belt for the forthcoming 'New Season' on BBC1. None of them, however, can really have anticipated just how huge everything was about to get. A new Dalek story with discotastically fashionable new secondary antagonists and the return of Davros which was guaranteed huge press coverage on account of the headline-friendly supporting cast alone nudging close to fifteen million viewers was one matter. The fact that the story that followed was an uproariously witty and grippingly inventive Douglas Adams-written runaround set and filmed in Paris that dominated excitedly speculative conversations for an entire month, featured a cliffhanger that thrillingly terrified an entire generation and included a sidesplitting cameo from John Cleese – not only fresh from the success of the second series of Fawlty Towers but also dominating headlines thanks to his wittily barbed responses to the controversy over Life Of Brian – was something else entirely. City Of Death could almost have been made specifically for its unexpectedly doubled audience and it notched up an almighty seventeen million viewers, making it not only the most watched Doctor Who story but also, at least as far as sizeable proportion of fans are concerned, the best story ever full stop. That said, it also represented a high watermark that it would be to say the least difficult to meet moving forwards, and this tacit weight of expectation – especially when it relates to a story broadcast in the closing weeks of a decade and thereby almost instantly by default an object of nostalgia – is one of the most notable amongst several potential causes of Doctor Who's declining profile during the decade that followed. Not everything else on offer from Doctor Who in 1979 alone, it has to be said, quite matched up to this standard, and while the first episode of the likeable but undistinguised The Creature From The Pit went out a couple of days after ITV resumed broadcasting on 24th October 1979 – an evening heralded by The Mike Sammes Singers triumphantly trilling 'Welcome, Welcome, Welcome Home to I! T! V!' but which soon descended into a lacklustre and threadbare lineup that included two interrupted mid-storyline soap operas and, with no small irony, the opening instalment of the downbeat and mutedly received Quatermass revival, which was noticeably short on “my dear, nobody could be as stupid as he seems”-level gags – but it is almost certain that everyone concerned drew a small sigh of relief that certain adventures later in the run had not found themselves under so intense a spotlight. Overall, however – and much like the rest of the BBC – they must have been feeling like they could not believe their luck, little realising that industrial action would derail their own plans almost immediately… Movellan Side Arms Killed The Radio Star Destiny Of The Daleks, it is fair to say, does not enjoy the loftiest of retrospective reputations. Even on the rare occasions on which it is afforded a degree of grudging respect on account of its storyline, humour or visual flair, it is nonetheless held up as a textbook example – much like all of those other supposed 'textbook examples' – of a Terry Nation story where three men all called Tarrant are scowlingly attempting to stop something that The Doctor eventually realises they are actually starting or whatever it is, complete with a sort of Wes Parmalee Davros with Doug Yule on songwriting duties which forced anyone who had enjoyed classic Genesis Of The Daleks because it was a classic to have to join the New York City Newsboys Strike of 1899. All of which, it cannot be emphasised enough, does not exactly tally with the experience of younger viewers late in 1979, ITV strike or otherwise, who simply heard a shout go up from the front room of “QUICK – it's half of a man and half of a Dalek” and hurtled in at a sideboard-colliding velocity to catch what they knew instantly was the best Doctor Who no arguments until a certain other half of a man incident later in that very same series. More to the point, such analyses invariably swerve any mention of the story's brand new secondary antagonists drawn from the same gloriously absurd realm of inspiration as the Voord, the Exxilons, the Kraals and the Mire Beast – Legs & Co.-jumpsuited Floella Benjamin-coiffured Hot Gossip-accessoried androids The Movellans, who unusually appeared to enjoy, if that's the right word, both tactical and technological superiority over the Daleks. About as Studio 54-ready a defining example of the Disco Sci-Fi phenomenon – which you can hear more about here, incidentally – as you are liable to find, the Movellans shared an unusually fashionable look that, as comical as it may appear from a present day perspective, you would have found all over Noel Edmonds' Multicoloured Swap Shop, The Kenny Everett Video Show and Top Of The Pops at the time.

City Of Death could almost have been made specifically for its unexpectedly doubled audience and it notched up an almighty seventeen million viewers, making it not only the most watched Doctor Who story but also, at least as far as sizeable proportion of fans are concerned, the best story ever full stop. That said, it also represented a high watermark that it would be to say the least difficult to meet moving forwards, and this tacit weight of expectation – especially when it relates to a story broadcast in the closing weeks of a decade and thereby almost instantly by default an object of nostalgia – is one of the most notable amongst several potential causes of Doctor Who's declining profile during the decade that followed. Not everything else on offer from Doctor Who in 1979 alone, it has to be said, quite matched up to this standard, and while the first episode of the likeable but undistinguised The Creature From The Pit went out a couple of days after ITV resumed broadcasting on 24th October 1979 – an evening heralded by The Mike Sammes Singers triumphantly trilling 'Welcome, Welcome, Welcome Home to I! T! V!' but which soon descended into a lacklustre and threadbare lineup that included two interrupted mid-storyline soap operas and, with no small irony, the opening instalment of the downbeat and mutedly received Quatermass revival, which was noticeably short on “my dear, nobody could be as stupid as he seems”-level gags – but it is almost certain that everyone concerned drew a small sigh of relief that certain adventures later in the run had not found themselves under so intense a spotlight. Overall, however – and much like the rest of the BBC – they must have been feeling like they could not believe their luck, little realising that industrial action would derail their own plans almost immediately… Movellan Side Arms Killed The Radio Star Destiny Of The Daleks, it is fair to say, does not enjoy the loftiest of retrospective reputations. Even on the rare occasions on which it is afforded a degree of grudging respect on account of its storyline, humour or visual flair, it is nonetheless held up as a textbook example – much like all of those other supposed 'textbook examples' – of a Terry Nation story where three men all called Tarrant are scowlingly attempting to stop something that The Doctor eventually realises they are actually starting or whatever it is, complete with a sort of Wes Parmalee Davros with Doug Yule on songwriting duties which forced anyone who had enjoyed classic Genesis Of The Daleks because it was a classic to have to join the New York City Newsboys Strike of 1899. All of which, it cannot be emphasised enough, does not exactly tally with the experience of younger viewers late in 1979, ITV strike or otherwise, who simply heard a shout go up from the front room of “QUICK – it's half of a man and half of a Dalek” and hurtled in at a sideboard-colliding velocity to catch what they knew instantly was the best Doctor Who no arguments until a certain other half of a man incident later in that very same series. More to the point, such analyses invariably swerve any mention of the story's brand new secondary antagonists drawn from the same gloriously absurd realm of inspiration as the Voord, the Exxilons, the Kraals and the Mire Beast – Legs & Co.-jumpsuited Floella Benjamin-coiffured Hot Gossip-accessoried androids The Movellans, who unusually appeared to enjoy, if that's the right word, both tactical and technological superiority over the Daleks. About as Studio 54-ready a defining example of the Disco Sci-Fi phenomenon – which you can hear more about here, incidentally – as you are liable to find, the Movellans shared an unusually fashionable look that, as comical as it may appear from a present day perspective, you would have found all over Noel Edmonds' Multicoloured Swap Shop, The Kenny Everett Video Show and Top Of The Pops at the time.

We can't talk about African cinemas going global without paying attention to how Hollywood's colonial relationship with Africa has shaped and influenced what African filmmakers believe will sell globally. What price is being paid to appeal to global audiences? Film-makers might focus so much on the western gaze that they lose focus on telling African stories authentically and respectfully.

mov_CC02BD5DEE41CE8E18EB1C22F95038B2,"  Justin Bieber - Credit: Renell Medrano Just in case it's not clocking to you, Justin Bieber is so standing on business right now. The pop superstar is back with his excellent new surprise album Swag, a comeback he announced only hours before it dropped. It's been four years since we've gotten new music from Bieber, and he's got a lot to say, since he's been through it in recent years. It's got slick R&B, raw voice-memo rock guitar sketches, experimental collabos with Mk.gee and Dijon. He throws down with Cash Cobain, Gunna, and Sexyy Redd. Yet it's all him, as he chronicles the day-to-day struggles of Bieberhood. Bieber's last album was his 2021 Justice, a star-studded breakthrough spawning the hit “Peaches,” the most sensual tribute to the erotics of fruit since Harry Styles' “Watermelon Sugar” and “Cherry.” But at 31, he's taking stock of his adult life. He spends Swag addressing his tribulations, whether personal or business. As you may have heard, this guy's had some issues lately — becoming a dad, cancelling a massive tour to attend to mental health concerns, well-publicized altercations with the papparazzi, chaotic smoke-and-post social media rants, gossip about his marriage, descootifying his business life. There is so much healing going on in this album, it's no surprise Bieber includes three different “therapy sessions” with the comedian Druski, getting up close and personal about his life. “That's been a tough thing for me recently, is feeling like I have had to go through a lot of my struggles as a human, as all of us do, really publicly,” he confides. “And so people are always asking if I'm okay, and that starts to really weigh on mе.” That takes a toll. “It starts to make me feel like I'm the one with issues and everyone else is perfect.” But if he's looking to answer all the “what the hell's happening to this guy?” headlines, he couldn't do much better than Swag, because the musical energy and imagination here is Bieber at his most confident. Serious question: has he ever done as a song as appealing as “Butterflies”? A song this open-hearted, this melodic, this effusive, with a bittersweet R&B tune and pop uplift, plus a quivering guitar hook that comes straight from (of all people) the Smashing Pumpkins? Swag isn't just Bieber out to prove he's doing okay — he's out to top himself. He covers so much ground here musically, with the R&B pop glitz of “All I Can Take” and “Go Baby,” but also lo-fi acoustic demos. He works with ace producers like Carter Lang, Eddie Benjamin, and Tobias Jesso Jr, with a woozy Eighties R&B vibe. (Bieber, like the rest of us, has clearly been dangerously obsessed with SZA's SOS.) Some of the “therapy sessions” might hit the cringe button, but then, so do yours, probably. Druski shouldn't even bother applying for his therapist license, since his approach to counseling is to keep offering the patient a hit on some dubious cigar while cracking jokes. He assures Bieber, “Your skin white, but your soul Black, Justin. I promise you, man.” But he also clowns him about the infamous clip where he yells “I'm standing on business” at the papparrazzi. (“You can't pronunciate every word when you doing that!”) “Sweet Spot” is a slightly different kind of therapy session, where Bieber informs Sexyy Red, “I like it sticky between the sheets.” These two explore a little sexual healing for a freaky slow jam. “At first I was shy, but I'm a dog when I be in them sheets,” she raps. (Wait, when exactly was Sexyy Red's shy era? Did we just miss that?) “That's my G-spot, he make my coochie pop/I'm a changed woman, used to be a thot-thot/That's my boyfriend, I love him a lot.” Bieber spends a lot of time here singing about hanging on to his wife Hailey, with the pensive “Walking Away.” “Girl, we better stop before we say some shit,” he sings, in a genuinely wise lightbulb moment. “We've been testing our patience/I think we're better off if we just take a break and remember what grace is.” More in Celebrity He's making sure nobody doubts his commitment to being a husband and dad. “Go Baby” gives Hailey a pep talk, especially impressed by the fact that she built a lucrative beauty brand around a phone case. He sings, “That's my baby, she's iconic/iPhone case, lipgloss on it.” He celebrates fatherhood with “Dadz Love,” teaming up with the most based of gods, Lil B. They turn it into a universal we-are-family anthem, as Lil B urges, “We need more people to get together.” “Devotion” is a Dijon collaboration that goes even beyond what you'd hope: even warmer, more uplifting, more understatedly gorgeous, with discreet echoes of pedal-steel guitar over the country-soul harmonies. Along with “Butterflies,” it's the most immediately embraceable track on Swag. “Daisies” teams up with Mk.gee for a Phil Collins-style mid-Eighties synth-pop bop with distorted beats and Mr. Mister-style guitar, the kind of retro shopping-mall trip that makes you picture Toto listening to wild dogs cry out in the night. But some of the best moments on Swag come when he leaves the pop production behind and goes lo-fi. “Zuma House” is a stripped-down acoustic-guitar ballad in the mode of Neil Young's Hitchhiker, 83 seconds of raw beauty, while “Glory Voice Memo” is a bluesy micro-jam; both tracks sound like they got recorded on a phone and just uploaded straight to the album....","Justin Bieber - Credit: Renell Medrano Just in case it's not clocking to you, Justin Bieber is so standing on business right now.

mov_1F266297E16A01813A61DCEE34CBB3B0,"  Whether it's a designer's rise from obscurity or the brand's roots in European heritage, these narratives aren't afterthoughts. When people think of successful startups, they often picture fast-paced tech companies, disruptive business models, and agile go-to-market strategies. On the other hand, the fashion industry — especially luxury brands — seems like a completely different world: elegant, timeless, exclusive. But beneath the surface, some of the most iconic fashion houses actually operate with the same branding brilliance that startup founders strive to achieve. In fact, the luxury sector holds powerful lessons for young businesses that want to build lasting impact, emotionally resonant identities, and loyal communities. Let's break down what early-stage entrepreneurs can learn from the high-fashion playbook — not just in terms of aesthetics, but in storytelling, positioning, and value perception. Storytelling as a Strategic Asset Every great fashion house has a story. Whether it's a designer's rise from obscurity or the brand's roots in European heritage, these narratives aren't afterthoughts — they are central to how the brand connects with its audience. Startups, too, can benefit immensely from mastering their origin story. Why was the company founded? What problem does it solve, and why does it matter? Founders who lead with authenticity and vision create a deeper emotional bond with early users or customers. Brands like Valentino, for example, have evolved over decades not just by designing products, but by building a mythos around Italian craftsmanship, individuality, and elegance. The story sells as much as the product — if not more. Perceived Value Is Often Greater Than Functional Value A luxury product isn't just about materials; it's about what it represents. A handbag or pair of shoes becomes a symbol of taste, class, or aspiration. Smart startups understand this principle and apply it in their own markets — even if their product is software, a wellness app, or a subscription box. It's the emotional hook — not just the utility — that builds customer loyalty. And just like high fashion has adapted to new economic realities through limited-time offers and online access, startups can blend exclusivity with accessibility. Today, even shoppers can enjoy a taste of luxury at a smarter price point thanks to curated platforms like Valentino Promo Codes from Valuecom, proving that timeless brands can still thrive in a digital-first, value-conscious world. Visual Identity and Consistency Matter From their logo typography to color schemes and packaging, luxury brands never cut corners on design consistency. Every Instagram post, ad campaign, and product launch is carefully curated to reflect the brand's DNA. Startups often move fast, which is good — but that can sometimes lead to a disjointed brand image. A clear, polished visual identity helps a company look more professional, more trustworthy, and more investment-worthy. Using high-end fashion brands as visual references — not to copy, but to learn — can help startups elevate their aesthetics without losing authenticity. Community Over Customers The best fashion brands don't just sell to customers — they cultivate communities of advocates. Whether through exclusive events, brand ambassadors, or social media engagement, they turn buyers into storytellers. For startups, community building is often the X-factor that drives organic growth. Think about platforms like Notion, Figma, or Glossier — their communities are part of the product experience. Following luxury fashion's lead, startups can prioritize user-generated content, limited beta access, and loyalty programs to fuel long-term growth. While products evolve and features change, a strong brand endures. Whether you're building a luxury fashion empire or a SaaS platform, your brand — how it feels, what it stands for, and how it's remembered — is your most valuable long-term asset. Luxury isn't just about price; it's about perception, intention, and connection. For startup founders, that's a lesson worth learning early.","Whether it's a designer's rise from obscurity or the brand's roots in European heritage, these narratives aren't afterthoughts.

Startups, too, can benefit immensely from mastering their origin story. Why was the company founded? What problem does it solve, and why does it matter? Founders who lead with authenticity and vision create a deeper emotional bond with early users or customers. Brands like Valentino, for example, have evolved over decades not just by designing products, but by building a mythos around Italian craftsmanship, individuality, and elegance. The story sells as much as the product — if not more. Perceived Value Is Often Greater Than Functional Value A luxury product isn't just about materials; it's about what it represents. A handbag or pair of shoes becomes a symbol of taste, class, or aspiration. Smart startups understand this principle and apply it in their own markets — even if their product is software, a wellness app, or a subscription box. It's the emotional hook — not just the utility — that builds customer loyalty. And just like high fashion has adapted to new economic realities through limited-time offers and online access, startups can blend exclusivity with accessibility. Today, even shoppers can enjoy a taste of luxury at a smarter price point thanks to curated platforms like Valentino Promo Codes from Valuecom, proving that timeless brands can still thrive in a digital-first, value-conscious world. Visual Identity and Consistency Matter From their logo typography to color schemes and packaging, luxury brands never cut corners on design consistency. Every Instagram post, ad campaign, and product launch is carefully curated to reflect the brand's DNA. Startups often move fast, which is good — but that can sometimes lead to a disjointed brand image. A clear, polished visual identity helps a company look more professional, more trustworthy, and more investment-worthy. Using high-end fashion brands as visual references — not to copy, but to learn — can help startups elevate their aesthetics without losing authenticity. Community Over Customers The best fashion brands don't just sell to customers — they cultivate communities of advocates. Whether through exclusive events, brand ambassadors, or social media engagement, they turn buyers into storytellers. For startups, community building is often the X-factor that drives organic growth. Think about platforms like Notion, Figma, or Glossier — their communities are part of the product experience. Following luxury fashion's lead, startups can prioritize user-generated content, limited beta access, and loyalty programs to fuel long-term growth. While products evolve and features change, a strong brand endures. Whether you're building a luxury fashion empire or a SaaS platform, your brand — how it feels, what it stands for, and how it's remembered — is your most valuable long-term asset. Luxury isn't just about price; it's about perception, intention, and connection. For startup founders, that's a lesson worth learning early.",2025-07-11 22:06:02,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"The comment mentions Glossier specifically as an example of a brand that successfully builds community around its product, highlighting its approach to creating a brand experience beyond just selling makeup.

mov_F652BED29B42B393BDACC30BEC0CB1DF,"  There's a certain magic when someone's genuine spirit cuts through the noise of curated perfection online. That's exactly what happened when Beccaxbloom burst onto the scene. Forget overnight sensations built on gimmicks; Rebecca “Becca” Bloom's rise felt different. Starting in her cozy Portland apartment during the pandemic's isolating days, she shared unfiltered moments – messy kitchen experiments, vulnerable chats about anxiety, and joyful dances in mismatched socks. It wasn't just relatable; it was a breath of fresh air. Fast forward three years, and Beccaxbloom isn't just a username; she's a movement. With over 8 million followers across Instagram and TikTok, collaborations with global brands like Glossier, and a thriving mental health initiative, she embodies what it means to bloom authentically in the digital age. Her journey proves that isn't just a catchy phrase – it's her reality, resonating deeply in a world craving real connection. Beccaxbloom: Blooming into the Digital Limelight with Authentic Charm Beccaxbloom's ascent wasn't accidental; it was built on a foundation of unwavering authenticity that made millions feel seen. While influencers often chase trends, Becca, a 28-year-old former graphic designer from Portland, Oregon, started simply by sharing her “real, unedited days” in early 2020. Her first viral moment came unexpectedly. A tearful, makeup-free TikTok video about struggling with lockdown loneliness and body image struck a chord, amassing over 2 million views in 48 hours. People weren't just watching; they were commenting, “This is exactly how I feel,” and “Thank you for being real.” This raw honesty became her signature. Unlike the highly produced content dominating feeds, Becca's posts felt like chatting with a close friend – complete with laughter, occasional stumbles, and profound insights. Her content pillars seamlessly blend everyday relatability with uplifting positivity: “Morning Realness” Vlogs: Unscripted glimpses into her routine – from meditation wins to burnt toast fails – celebrating imperfection. “Bloom Chats” Live Sessions: Deep, empathetic discussions on mental wellness, relationships, and self-acceptance. Creative Expression: Whimsical DIY projects, watercolor painting sessions, and impromptu living-room dances showcasing her artistic roots. This approach fueled explosive growth. She hit 1 million Instagram followers within 18 months, a testament to her resonant message. Major publications like Teen Vogue and Bustle featured her as a leader in the “authenticity wave,” highlighting her refusal to use heavy filters or promote unrealistic standards. Her impact is measurable: engagement rates consistently double platform averages, and hashtags like #BloomWithMe and #RealNotPerfect , sparked by her, have garnered billions of views. Users share their own vulnerable stories, creating a supportive community. This organic, trust-based connection is the core of Beccaxbloom: Blooming into the Digital Limelight with Authentic Charm . She didn't just gain followers; she cultivated a tribe united by shared vulnerability and growth. Understanding how her authenticity reshaped audience expectations is crucial in analyzing modern social media success, as discussed in our exploration of evolving digital community dynamics. The Roots of Resilience: Becca's Journey Before the Likes Long before hashtags and brand deals, Becca's character was forged through experiences that shaped her empathetic worldview. Born in Seattle but raised primarily in Portland, Oregon, she grew up in a creative, supportive household. Her mother, a music teacher, and father, a landscape architect, encouraged curiosity and self-expression. However, Becca faced significant challenges. Diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder at 15, she navigated high school feeling isolated. “I felt like I was performing all the time, terrified people would see the 'messy' me,” she shared in a poignant 2022 interview. Art became her sanctuary – filling sketchbooks with intricate drawings and finding solace in writing poetry. After graduating from the University of Oregon with a BFA in Graphic Design in 2017, Becca worked at a Portland marketing agency. While successful, she felt creatively stifled and emotionally drained. The pressure to project constant professionalism clashed with her internal struggles. The pandemic lockdown in March 2020 became a pivotal turning point. Furloughed and isolated, she started an anonymous Instagram account, “@blooming_through,” initially as a personal visual diary. Her early posts were simple: a photo of a rainy window with reflections on uncertainty, a sketch of a wilting plant captioned “Still growing, even on hard days.” The anonymity provided safety, allowing her to share fears about her mental health and career doubts with startling honesty. This raw vulnerability resonated with others feeling similarly adrift. Her follower count grew steadily into the thousands, primarily through word-of-mouth shares in online support groups. By late 2020, embracing her full identity, she rebranded as Beccaxbloom , signaling a commitment to bloom openly, not anonymously. This period wasn't glamorous; it was foundational. The resilience built through her personal struggles became the bedrock of her authentic online presence, proving that Beccaxbloom: Blooming into the Digital Limelight with Authentic Charm was rooted in real-life perseverance long before the spotlight found her.
