1lshmb7,"  I have been dealing with this bs since I was a pre-teen, so like 26 yrs (sheesh time flies!) . In that time I've tried all the dandruff shampoos, all the derm prescriptions, and some specialty products I've come across. For many of these things I thought I'd finally found the solution, but ultimately my invaders would adapt and I'd be back to square one. Most shampoos are just too harsh for my wig 😫, so washing more than once a week is out of the question, periodt. I've also tried some remedies from this sub before, but recently I decided to try some old ideas with a new twist, just for funsies, and uhh, well… my scalp has been completely clear for almost a full 2 weeks, and I haven't applied any additional products in at least 11 days. I honestly don't know if it was one, or some, or all of these things that got me here today, but here's what I did… - Before washing, I sprayed my scalp with a 4:1 mix of water:xylitol (you read that right. The sweetener). I left it in long enough that it dried but I don't think it mattered. Reapplied right before washing too, for good measure. This step was the only thing I've never tried before. *I measured this out in grams btw, because I take ratios seriously - I butchered what was left of my $40 Briogeo Scalp Revival Megastrength shampoo (it wasn't working anymore anyway 🙄) by adding an unmeasured, incalculable amount of additional pure salicylic acid (but honestly not much), mct (c8, c10) oil, and tea tree oil. Lathered it into my hair, let it sit while I showered, rinsed my hair as the very last step. - Dried my hair and put a mix of mct oil, with tea tree and salicylic acid added in, all over my scalp. Again, didn't measure, just followed my heart. *You have to heat the oil to get the salicylic acid to dissolve. Under the hood, here's what each thing does: - If your sebderm is due to excess yeast, xylitol is essentially the first phase of a boss fight where you take down the shield before you can do damage. Xylitol disrupts formation of the biofilm (shield) of the yeast and left it open for a full blown assault by everything else I used. - Salicylic acid affects keratin in the skin, so it helps loosen up any flakes you already have, but it also is supposed to reduce inflammation and itchiness/dryness, and help reduce oil (sebum) production, which yeast feed on. - Tea tree oil is an anti fungal and anti inflammatory, but it's too strong on its own so it needs a carrier oil… - Mct oil is anti fungal, moisturizing, and… a great carrier oil. NOTHING I've tried has allowed me 2 weeks of normalcy without having to do ANYthing extra. Not ever. I haven't added a drop of my oil mix to my hair in about 11 days and I check my scalp every single day. Completely clear. The only thing I don't love is that I don't know if all this is necessary (butchering my shampoo and adding extra salicylic acid to everything), so over time I'm going to cut some corners and see how it goes. I just hope this continues to work","I have been dealing with this bs since I was a pre-teen, so like 26 yrs (sheesh time flies!) .

mov_5A4DEBA3C3502A1809F4B7D2F8F2EDF7,"  It's not every day that I'm willingly spend money on beauty products. That is, until Amazon Prime Day rolls around. As a beauty editor, my desk is consistently stacked high with boxes of products vying for a chance to be tried and praised, but few things beat the tubes and jars I've trusted for years. Because I'm a bit spoiled by free products, I find it hard to splash out on my favorites when I'm running low—but when they're slashed by as much as 50% during Prime Day, which runs from July 8 to 11, I'll never hesitate to hit purchase. To access these steep discounts while they last, you'll need to sign up for an Amazon Prime membership, which is free for 30 days before charging a monthly fee. From there, you can reap the benefits of on-sale luxury and drugstore beauty, along with the fashion must-haves, home décor findings, and more that Who What Wear editors have meticulously selected. Below, the Amazon beauty products that I buy on repeat (starting at just $4!) from brands such as Kiehl's, Laneige, Supergoop! , and more—plus a few big-ticket items I'd recommend snagging now that they're on sale. Editor-Approved Beauty Deals Under $30 Dr.Althea 345 Relief Cream Daily Face Moisturizer Of all the facial moisturizers I own, I never travel anywhere without the Dr.Althea 345 Relief Cream. I love this soothing cream for its niacinamide-forward formula, which helps quell my rosacea-induced redness, while hyaluronic acid and ceramides help hydrate the skin and lock in moisture. Plus, its squeeze-tube bottle makes it easily portable, which is why I never hesitate to hit buy when I spot it on sale. Wonderskin Wonder Blading Lip Stain Peel Off Masque I, along with the rest of the Who What Wear beauty team, fell in love with this best-selling viral lip stain from Amazon this year: the Wonderskin Wonder Blading Lip Stain that sent TikTok into a tizzy. All you do is let the dark formula sit for 10 to 30 seconds like a mask (I like to apply it like lip liner) before wiping it off with a damp towel for a tint that lasts for hours. Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Speaking of peeling things off, there's never been a better time to stock up on Hero's original pimple patches than while they're on sale for just $10. These hydrocolloid stickers work overnight to zap zits and whiteheads after just one use—no picking or popping necessary. I keep these patches in my medicine cabinet and pack a sheet in every carry-on for the inevitable travel-induced breakouts. Nécessaire The Body Wash Crowned one of our very favorite bodywashes this year, the Nécessaire The Body Wash is a necessity (get it?) for several reasons. It's made with a vitamin-rich formula that supports hydration, even skin tones, and smoother texture, and its gentle scent doesn't bother any of our beauty editors—even those of us with sensitive skin. Now, you can nab any scent for just $21. Briogeo Style + Treat Yuzu + Plum Oil Sleek Stick I, along with everyone else who favors a bad-hair-day updo, have a lot of love for the sleek, slicked-back bun. However, there were always stray hairs and breakage poking up at my hairline—that is until the Briogeo Sleek Stick came into my life. While other wax sticks at Amazon would take multiple washes to actually get out of my hair, this non-greasy, never-damaging wax offers a smooth, glossy finish that makes my strands feel soft and washes like a breeze, no scrubbing required. Oh, and did I mention it's a Who What Wear Beauty Award winner? Supergoop! Glowscreen SPF 40 I likely need not introduce you to the Supergoop! Glowscreen, but I do need to inform you that it's on sale and ripe for the taking. This radiant, tone-evening sunscreen offers a lit-from-within glow while smoothing your skin into a filter-like veil; its formula is pumped full of SPF 40 and hyaluronic acid for an extra dose of protection. It's not only a favorite tinted sunscreen, but it's a top-notch makeup primer, too. Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara The Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara from Essence was already a steal at just $5 full-price, but at its Prime Day rate, buying a tube almost feels illegal. My fellow beauty editors have waxed poetic about this inexpensive formula for its impressive lengthening and curl-preserving powers, and I've personally bought this tube twice in the past year.

mov_19EFB214706F9D35B333BDED0EA4D69C,"  The best curl creams can really take your hair care routine to the next level. For the uninitiated, these are styling products that are used on coily, curly, and wavy hair types in order to create more defined curls while also addressing issues like frizz and dryness. A good curl defining cream isn't always dependent on what your hair type or curl pattern is—sometimes the best things to look for are hydrating or nourishing ingredients that seal moisture into the hair. My hair, for example, is prone to dryness, and I've noticed that my curls respond a lot better to formulas that contain key ingredients like shea butter and coconut oil. The good news is that there are dozens of options to choose from, and we spent two months incorporating several different types into our regular hair care routines, before narrowing down our favorites to the list ahead. Whether you're looking for a multitasker that hydrates and prevents breakage (like our best overall winner!) or one that perfectly defines waves for your wash and go, there's something here for every hair type and need. The best curl defining creams, at a glance: Best Overall: Pattern Beauty Styling Cream Courtesy of brand Original photo from Paton Hardy testing Pattern Beauty Styling Cream ChevronChevron Pattern Beauty Styling Cream $28 Amazon Key ingredients: Shea butter, cacay oil, almond oil Size: 15 oz. Pros: Defines curls, prevents breakage Cons: Thick and may leave residue on the hair More often than not, curl creams are looked at simply as styling products that only help with defining curly hair, but that's only partly true, since some curl creams can also address frequent issues that people with curly, wavy, and coily hair face like damage and breakage. That's where the Pattern Beauty Styling Cream comes in—it's made with ingredients like shea butter, cacay oil, and almond oil to promote length and moisture retention and to prevent breakage at the ends. So not only will it give type 3 and 4 curls a crazy amount of definition, it puts in even more work to strengthen the hair from the inside out, something not all curl creams claim to do. “The texture for this one was really thick, but it gave my curls nice definition when I applied it,” says Condé Nast Content Licensing Associate, Paton Hardy, who has very fine, curly hair. “After the fact, it was a little drying for me, so I found it best to be used with a hair oil. It also smelled super fresh!” Best Drugstore: SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie Courtesy of brand Original photo from Danielle Jackson testing SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie Original photo from Danielle Jackson testing SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie ChevronChevron SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie $12 $8 (33% off) Amazon Key ingredients: Coconut oil, silk protein Size: 12 oz. Pros: Moisturizes really well, manages frizz, under $20 Cons: It's really thick, so your hair doesn't really absorb it This is an oldie but goodie that's a SheaMoisture bestseller (it was also highly-recommended by people in my immediate friend group when I first went natural in college), and it definitely lives up to the hype. It has ingredients like coconut oil and silk protein, which moisturizes the hair from inside the shaft, and it prevents common curl woes like frizziness. Sometimes I use this cream after washing and blowing out my coily, type 4 curls (I prefer to do twist outs on stretched hair), and even after applying it to my hair in a blown out state, the curls still manage to turn out looking like healthy spirals. I'm also a really big fan of the way this product makes my hair feel—after unraveling my twists, I usually find myself continuously touching my curls because of how satisfied I am with how soft and moisturized my hair feels. My only gripe is that this is a product that sort of sits on your hair—it's pretty thick, so that's to be expected—so if you're someone who touches your hair often, you'll definitely be able to feel that there's something on your strands, though it doesn't leave behind an oily or greasy film.

Whether you're looking for a multitasker that hydrates and prevents breakage (like our best overall winner!) or one that perfectly defines waves for your wash and go, there's something here for every hair type and need. The best curl defining creams, at a glance: Best Overall: Pattern Beauty Styling Cream Courtesy of brand Original photo from Paton Hardy testing Pattern Beauty Styling Cream ChevronChevron Pattern Beauty Styling Cream $28 Amazon Key ingredients: Shea butter, cacay oil, almond oil Size: 15 oz. Pros: Defines curls, prevents breakage Cons: Thick and may leave residue on the hair More often than not, curl creams are looked at simply as styling products that only help with defining curly hair, but that's only partly true, since some curl creams can also address frequent issues that people with curly, wavy, and coily hair face like damage and breakage. That's where the Pattern Beauty Styling Cream comes in—it's made with ingredients like shea butter, cacay oil, and almond oil to promote length and moisture retention and to prevent breakage at the ends. So not only will it give type 3 and 4 curls a crazy amount of definition, it puts in even more work to strengthen the hair from the inside out, something not all curl creams claim to do. “The texture for this one was really thick, but it gave my curls nice definition when I applied it,” says Condé Nast Content Licensing Associate, Paton Hardy, who has very fine, curly hair. “After the fact, it was a little drying for me, so I found it best to be used with a hair oil. It also smelled super fresh!” Best Drugstore: SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie Courtesy of brand Original photo from Danielle Jackson testing SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie Original photo from Danielle Jackson testing SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie ChevronChevron SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie $12 $8 (33% off) Amazon Key ingredients: Coconut oil, silk protein Size: 12 oz. Pros: Moisturizes really well, manages frizz, under $20 Cons: It's really thick, so your hair doesn't really absorb it This is an oldie but goodie that's a SheaMoisture bestseller (it was also highly-recommended by people in my immediate friend group when I first went natural in college), and it definitely lives up to the hype. It has ingredients like coconut oil and silk protein, which moisturizes the hair from inside the shaft, and it prevents common curl woes like frizziness. Sometimes I use this cream after washing and blowing out my coily, type 4 curls (I prefer to do twist outs on stretched hair), and even after applying it to my hair in a blown out state, the curls still manage to turn out looking like healthy spirals. I'm also a really big fan of the way this product makes my hair feel—after unraveling my twists, I usually find myself continuously touching my curls because of how satisfied I am with how soft and moisturized my hair feels. My only gripe is that this is a product that sort of sits on your hair—it's pretty thick, so that's to be expected—so if you're someone who touches your hair often, you'll definitely be able to feel that there's something on your strands, though it doesn't leave behind an oily or greasy film.
