mov_88A0F50056CE4F5AA9964A06605BB91B,"  SPR_COMBO[zh-tw]【記者呂承哲／台北報導】美國對等關稅暫緩期即將於7月9日到期，全球政經情勢面臨新一輪變局，「台股多頭總司令」國泰投信董事長張錫表示，儘管關稅政策、地緣戰爭與油價波動導致全球通膨壓力，但整體景氣呈現「先蹲後跳」格局，AI仍為全球剛性需求，資金與供應鏈緊密聚焦，對台灣產業與資本市場形成實質利多，「產業長線走多」的態勢明確。 張錫表示，美國總統川普推動對等關稅，實則為貿易談判增添籌碼，目的並非單純打壓對手，而是吸引更多製造業回流與外資赴美設廠。 但他點出，美國結構以服務業為主，製造業回流面臨「彈性」與「分工」困境，且當地勞動文化不利於高效率生產，即使不是成本問題，生產品質也難與亞洲相比。 換言之，「關稅只是手段，不是目的」，其長期效益尚未能顯現。 全球資本市場方面，張錫觀察到，AI產業已成市場主流與趨勢所在。 以四大CSP（超大規模雲端服務供應商）為例，原本就已規劃逾千億美元資本支出，近期更宣布進一步擴大投入，從雲端伺服器、AI晶片、終端裝置到邊緣運算全線開展，沒有AI的產業，股價基本不會漲，資本流向明確。 根據麥肯錫研究，在中性假設下，未來五年AI相關資料中心將成長至現有的3.5倍規模，支撐AI浪潮的「軍火庫」正是半導體。 張錫指出，台灣擁有先進製程與半導體封裝技術優勢，是AI科技不可或缺的一環。 經歷2021年供應高峰與兩年去化庫存後，半導體產業正走入補庫存週期。 近期台積電法說會釋出樂觀訊號，包括2奈米先進製程準備量產、CoWoS封裝大幅擴產，皆為AI需求升溫的佐證。 從台灣資金方面來看，張錫指出，主計總處估算，今年國內超額儲蓄將突破4兆元，若能有效導入資本市場，將為內需與投資注入強大動能。 他進一步提到，外資過去幾年雖大幅賣超，但台股並未因此重挫，背後正是本土資金與ETF長期布局的力量。 目前台灣ETF總規模已逾6.3兆元，受益人數合計逾1,500萬人，顯示「散戶已學會理性投資、逢低加碼」，特別是在4月川普宣布對等關稅導致股市急跌時，散戶進場撐盤，形成「散戶軋法人、軋外資」的新態勢。 展望未來，張錫認為，AI科技才剛起步，接下來幾年仍將帶動全球大規模資本支出，台灣科技與半導體供應鏈仍處領先地位，投資價值長線明確。 張錫建議投資人可透過市值型ETF，如國泰台灣領袖50（00922）來布局，該ETF涵蓋50檔台灣龍頭企業，成分股多元，風險分散，適合穩健參與台股成長。 他也強調，面對短期波動，可採「大跌時勇敢加碼」、「長期定期定額」兩大策略，提升投資勝率，把握台股長多行情。 【看原文連結】

Styling a classic tartan print Burberry string bikini with a set of black leather pirate boots, the 34-year-old leaned into the 'less is more' aesthetic.

Adding to the look, Rita paired her stack of colourful admission wrist bands with a slew of gold bangles and a dainty watch. To match her armcandy accessories, she layered a chunky necklace with other pendant options to create a mismatched ensemble. The Burberry Cobb bikini, which features as the hero piece in the brand's latest Burberry Check campaign starring Alexa Chung and Cara Delevingne, seems to be a fan favourite for Rita.

The U.S.-China trade war poses challenges, impacting costs and availability. Key trends include circular economy initiatives, online retail strategies, and urban demand in emerging markets. Segment growth varies, with watches and jewelry leading, while beauty and fragrances witness fastest growth. APAC remains the dominant region, driven by urbanization and digital retail transformation. Major players like LVMH and Rolex leverage strategic partnerships and innovation to maintain market positioning. Personal Luxury Goods Market Dublin, July 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Personal Luxury Goods Market Research Report 2025-2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Personal Luxury Goods Market was valued at USD 410 billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 526 billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 4.24%. The global personal luxury goods market is fragmented and characterized by numerous manufacturers that hold modest market share. Key players, including LVH, Prada Group, Rolex, Kering, and Richemont, among others, have established dominance in the market by continuously innovating and expanding their product offerings. Major vendors are strategically implementing innovative technologies to maintain their market positions. For instance, in 2023, Burberry introduced its virtual store by partnering with Blankos Block Party, a gaming platform, and offering interactive product discovery. The companies in the personal luxury goods industry are also focusing on several strategic partnerships with other providers to ensure continuous supply chains and manufacturing capabilities. For instance, in 2023, Kering completed a 30% acquisition of the Italian luxury fashion house Valentino. The partnership is between Valentino's parent company, Mayhoola, and it has also provided an option for Kering to acquire the remaining 70% by 2028. The leaders in the personal luxury goods market are making significant R&D investments to enhance the availability and differentiation of their products. For instance, in 2024, Richemont acquired Vhernier, which is an Italian jewelry brand, to enhance its Jewelry Maisons division. Furthermore, companies are increasingly expanding their product range and strengthening their market positions through acquisitions and partnerships. For instance, in 2024, Lavie Luxe launched its new 18% fragrance concentration perfume line, featuring four Eau de Parfum fragrances named LUSH, LILY, LAGOON, and LOVE. Consumers are increasingly interested in luxury goods that are designed with circular economic principles, such as those that can be easily upcycled. Gucci was the first luxury brand to use ECONYL recycled nylon in ready-wear pieces, which is a 100% recycled nylon derived from fishing nets, textile waste, and a thick pile fabric used for carpets and upholstery. Luxury brands have increasingly adopted online approaches to meet evolving consumer expectations. For instance, in 2023, Dior was the most popular luxury brand online because of its strategic investments in digital marketing, e-commerce, and social media engagement. This approach helped the brand to engage a wider audience, which has boosted its online sales, especially in markets like China and the US. Brands strategically position themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops in places like Bali and Phuket. It has created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. Hence, such factors are supporting the demand for the personal luxury goods market across emerging nations. As the global economies continue to grow, disposable income levels rise, leading to increased spending on luxury items like footwear. Consumers are increasingly inclined towards luxury footwear because of changing lifestyles and fashion trends. Luxury footwear companies are focusing on the growing consumer base in developing countries such as India and other Southeast Asian countries, where wealth and demand for luxury goods are rising. In 2022, Louis Vuitton introduced its exclusive footwear collection for the Indian market, which features new colors like Rani Pink and glittering designs for celebrating India's cultural heritage. Urbanization in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia continues to drive demand for the personal luxury goods market. In India, platforms like Luxepolis have significantly supported the development of the market by offering new and pre-owned luxury items to a growing audience in smaller cities, as the growing urban population increases the demand for high-end items. Brands are strategically positioning themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops to places like Bali and Phuket. Additionally, collaborations between fashion houses and hospitality venues such as Fendi's beach club in Marbella have created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS The disruption in the supply chain has led to increased costs for raw materials, logistics, and transportation, which have raised operational costs and are often passed on to end consumers which leading to higher luxury goods prices. The focus on limited production to maintain exclusivity significantly raises the production costs for luxury brands. Brands often face higher unit costs for manufacturing, sourcing premium materials, and utilizing skilled labor for producing limited edition items. This limits scalability and hampers the personal luxury goods market demand. Furthermore, major brands occasionally face backlash for products or marketing campaigns, such as Louis Vuitton for selling a scarf inspired by the Palestinian keffiyeh and a jacket that seems to present Jamaican culture by using the country's flags but incorrectly represented. These factors hamper the brand value and show the need for careful consideration in global marketing efforts. PERSONAL LUXURY GOODS MARKET GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS The APAC region dominated the global personal luxury goods market, accounting for a share of over 38% in 2024. APAC is experiencing a surge in urbanization and rising disposable income, particularly in countries like China, India, and Southeast Asian countries.

mov_F5FFB5E6CAAFD8C981AAA9AD9A2697C5,"  With the sun setting past teatime on a baking Wimbledon day, and the shade gradually emerging across the court, Britain's top singles player entered the arena in a primetime slot. Burberry models and social media influencers posed and pouted courtside, eager to show off their prized viewing spot. Only 23 years young, Jack Draper had better get used to this. Yet as first rounds at Wimbledon go, this was as comfortable as they come. Frankly, Draper could play on this stage for another decade and won't have an easier match at the All England Club. While world No 4 Alexander Zverev crashed out 200 metres south of the grounds on Centre Court – the 12th men's seed to be eliminated in the first round here – Draper's mission against Sebastian Baez on Court 1 was simple: total destruction. So much so that he forced his opponent into submission. A scoreline of supremacy read 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 (ret.) , with the Argentinean retiring due to a knee injury. With a bit of luck, Draper will be back home in Putney in time for Tuesday night's highlights show. Seventy-four minutes and done. Mission accomplished. The quick duration is not insignificant. At Grand Slams, playing best-of-five sets every other day, any chance of respite should gratefully be grasped. Draper's conditioning has deserted him before, not least when he vomited on court in the US Open semi-finals last summer. But this is the new and improved Draper: a well-oiled powerhouse and physical specimen. Here, he was keen not to waste anyone's time. Although that was not the party line. “I wanted to play a bit longer, in all honesty,” he said, with a smirk, on-court afterwards. “I was getting my tennis together a bit. It's no way to win like that, I wish Sebastian the best of recoveries.” Now the world No 4, Draper's rise from 28 in the world one year ago has been meteoric. With his run to the final four in New York and an illustrious title at Indian Wells behind him, the 23-year-old not only believes effusively in his hard graft and ability. Now, he has the results and the ranking to back it up. What's next? A tougher test, in the form of 2017 finalist Marin Cilic, in the second round on Thursday. Draper has not actually progressed to the third round at SW19 before; a record he'll be desperate to extinguish, with the weight of expectation around him now expecting at least a quarter-final. In this brief opening glimpse, it's hard to argue against the notion he'll have too much firepower for 36-year-old Cilic. Injured or not, Baez was never going to threaten the Briton today. By ranking, there were only five players who could've posed a tougher test for Draper in the opening two rounds. But the reality is that the world No 38 was on a five-match losing streak and had not won on a grass court in over two years. Truth be told, there are clay court specialists, and then there's Sebastian Baez. The Argentine is only a year older than Draper but actually has four more ATP tour titles to his name. However, six of those seven have come on the red dust; a surface Baez makes his unequivocal priority every season. In fact, this contest was his first match with pristine green under his shoes this year. Early on, you could tell. Draper broke in the first game of the match, dictating and dominating with his humdinger of a forehand: a shot so powerful it can go radically go astray in moments of tension, it is the Brit's biggest weapon when it's on song. Coupled with his whipped lefty serve, it makes for a handy one-two on the low-trajectory Wimbledon grass. Another break soon followed, signs of Baez's imminent surrender incoming. Having lost the opening set, Baez experienced a sudden slip changing direction, another sign of a player unaccustomed to the nuances of grass-court movement. Draper pounced quickly on his prey, immediately hitting a drop-shot to perfection. Beyond his imposing muscularity, the Brit's improved matchplay instincts are also worthy of merit in explaining his impressive last 12 months. He broke again to start the second, while Baez saw a group of medical staff who tended to his right knee. The Argentine opted to continue but was powerless to halt Draper's assault. The British No 1 went a double break up with a sparkling forehand crosscourt on the run, to the roar of 10,000 in Wimbledon's second biggest court. After an hour, Draper was a set from home. A quick break to love saw Draper lead 2-1 in the third set when Baez called it a day, due to a right knee injury. In sum, Draper lost four points against his serve all evening. And with big-serving dark horse Alexander Bublik, a potential third-round opponent, surprisingly exiting earlier on Tuesday, Draper's route to the second week looks a bit more rosy than 24 hours ago. For this to be the biggest fortnight of his life, things have to fall into place....","With the sun setting past teatime on a baking Wimbledon day, and the shade gradually emerging across the court, Britain's top singles player entered the arena in a primetime slot.

So much so that he forced his opponent into submission. A scoreline of supremacy read 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 (ret.) , with the Argentinean retiring due to a knee injury. With a bit of luck, Draper will be back home in Putney in time for Tuesday night's highlights show. Seventy-four minutes and done. Mission accomplished. The quick duration is not insignificant. At Grand Slams, playing best-of-five sets every other day, any chance of respite should gratefully be grasped. Draper's conditioning has deserted him before, not least when he vomited on court in the US Open semi-finals last summer. But this is the new and improved Draper: a well-oiled powerhouse and physical specimen. Here, he was keen not to waste anyone's time. Although that was not the party line. “I wanted to play a bit longer, in all honesty,” he said, with a smirk, on-court afterwards. “I was getting my tennis together a bit. It's no way to win like that, I wish Sebastian the best of recoveries.” Now the world No 4, Draper's rise from 28 in the world one year ago has been meteoric. With his run to the final four in New York and an illustrious title at Indian Wells behind him, the 23-year-old not only believes effusively in his hard graft and ability. Now, he has the results and the ranking to back it up. What's next? A tougher test, in the form of 2017 finalist Marin Cilic, in the second round on Thursday. Draper has not actually progressed to the third round at SW19 before; a record he'll be desperate to extinguish, with the weight of expectation around him now expecting at least a quarter-final. In this brief opening glimpse, it's hard to argue against the notion he'll have too much firepower for 36-year-old Cilic. Injured or not, Baez was never going to threaten the Briton today. By ranking, there were only five players who could've posed a tougher test for Draper in the opening two rounds. But the reality is that the world No 38 was on a five-match losing streak and had not won on a grass court in over two years. Truth be told, there are clay court specialists, and then there's Sebastian Baez. The Argentine is only a year older than Draper but actually has four more ATP tour titles to his name. However, six of those seven have come on the red dust; a surface Baez makes his unequivocal priority every season. In fact, this contest was his first match with pristine green under his shoes this year. Early on, you could tell. Draper broke in the first game of the match, dictating and dominating with his humdinger of a forehand: a shot so powerful it can go radically go astray in moments of tension, it is the Brit's biggest weapon when it's on song. Coupled with his whipped lefty serve, it makes for a handy one-two on the low-trajectory Wimbledon grass. Another break soon followed, signs of Baez's imminent surrender incoming. Having lost the opening set, Baez experienced a sudden slip changing direction, another sign of a player unaccustomed to the nuances of grass-court movement. Draper pounced quickly on his prey, immediately hitting a drop-shot to perfection. Beyond his imposing muscularity, the Brit's improved matchplay instincts are also worthy of merit in explaining his impressive last 12 months. He broke again to start the second, while Baez saw a group of medical staff who tended to his right knee. The Argentine opted to continue but was powerless to halt Draper's assault. The British No 1 went a double break up with a sparkling forehand crosscourt on the run, to the roar of 10,000 in Wimbledon's second biggest court. After an hour, Draper was a set from home. A quick break to love saw Draper lead 2-1 in the third set when Baez called it a day, due to a right knee injury. In sum, Draper lost four points against his serve all evening. And with big-serving dark horse Alexander Bublik, a potential third-round opponent, surprisingly exiting earlier on Tuesday, Draper's route to the second week looks a bit more rosy than 24 hours ago.

Draper broke in the first game of the match, dictating and dominating with his humdinger of a forehand: a shot so powerful it can go radically go astray in moments of tension, it is the Brit's biggest weapon when it's on song. Coupled with his whipped lefty serve, it makes for a handy one-two on the low-trajectory Wimbledon grass. Another break soon followed, signs of Baez's imminent surrender incoming. Having lost the opening set, Baez experienced a sudden slip changing direction, another sign of a player unaccustomed to the nuances of grass-court movement. Draper pounced quickly on his prey, immediately hitting a drop-shot to perfection. Beyond his imposing muscularity, the Brit's improved matchplay instincts are also worthy of merit in explaining his impressive last 12 months. He broke again to start the second, while Baez saw a group of medical staff who tended to his right knee. The Argentine opted to continue but was powerless to halt Draper's assault. The British No 1 went a double break up with a sparkling forehand crosscourt on the run, to the roar of 10,000 in Wimbledon's second biggest court. After an hour, Draper was a set from home. A quick break to love saw Draper lead 2-1 in the third set when Baez called it a day, due to a right knee injury. In sum, Draper lost four points against his serve all evening. And with big-serving dark horse Alexander Bublik, a potential third-round opponent, surprisingly exiting earlier on Tuesday, Draper's route to the second week looks a bit more rosy than 24 hours ago.

mov_CACBB39F8794686A8F8552E53931B476,"  Retail facilities maintenance and store experience management software company Worksmith has announced the acquisition of Progress Retail, a move that aims to transform how multi-location retail brands manage both their physical environments and their workforce. The strategic combination creates a vertically integrated retail operations platform that streamlines facilities management, staff learning, task execution, and communication. The integration brings together Worksmith's strengths in vendor management and service execution with Progress Retail's expertise in employee training and streamlining store operations and experience. This expanded capability targets the growing need among retailers for a unified solution to run operations efficiently at scale. Bryan Burkhart, CEO of Worksmith, said the acquisition marks a significant step toward realizing the company's long-term vision: “The acquisition of Progress Retail represents the next step in our vision at Worksmith to become the one-stop shop for retail operations. Up until now, retail operations leaders have had to rely on a multitude of different systems to run their complex, geographically-dispersed, operations. With the acquisition of Progress Retail by Worksmith, this job becomes a little easier.” Addressing a Fragmented Retail Tech Stack The combined platform aims to solve a major pain point for retailers: the fragmentation of tools used across departments like HR, learning and development, visual merchandising, and store maintenance. By unifying these functions, Worksmith and Progress Retail aim to reduce operational complexity, improve employee engagement, and enhance customer experience. According to Deloitte's 2025 Retail Outlook, 69% of retail CIOs plan to increase investment in frontline store technology to enable unified commerce and reduce attrition. The new combined platform responds to this shift by offering a fully integrated solution that supports both backend operations and frontline execution. Progress Retail's learning management and workforce experience tools — which include capabilities such as task management, employee communication, and training — over time will be integrated into Worksmith's service execution suite, which is already used by major global retail brands such as Burberry, Nespresso, Ferragamo, Louis Vuitton, and Tiffany & Co. Global Reach and Continued Innovation Progress Retail, which was founded in 2017 and led by Ray Riley has grown its client base internationally, with customers in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Notable clients include Fleet Feet, Faherty, Lume, in addition to Canadian brands including Pilgrim and Andrews. Importantly, all Progress Retail employees will remain with the company. This ensures continuity for current clients and is expected to accelerate product innovation across the combined platform. The Progress Retail business unit will continue operating under its existing leadership, with CEO Ray Riley assuming the new role of Vice President of Retail at Worksmith. “Coming off a strong 2024, we're eager to deliver a unified, tailored solution for cross-functional retail leadership across facilities and maintenance, visual merchandising, retail operations, HR, L&D, and more,” said Riley. “We are excited to continue our mission of simplifying retail operations with Bryan and the Worksmith team.” A Shared Vision for Future Growth Worksmith and Progress Retail say the integration will allow them to pursue expanded product capabilities and potentially other strategic acquisitions. The companies plan to cross-offer each platform to their respective client bases, and jointly market the new integrated solution to new retail brands. “We are excited to welcome the Progress Retail team to Worksmith; to increase investment in the Progress Retail software platform; to offer the Progress Retail software to existing Worksmith customers; to offer the Worksmith platform to Progress Retail customers; and to market the combined solution to new, prospective customers,” said Burkhart. “Together, we provide a comprehensive offering for retail operations leaders.” The joint platform is positioned as an all-in-one solution to help retailers optimize their store performance, automate key functions, and scale global operations efficiently.

La banda más representativa de britpop se separó en 2009, pero ha seguido muy presente musicalmente -sus dos primeros álbumes, 'Definitely Maybe' (1994) y '(What's the Story) Morning Glory?' (1995) están entre los discos más populares de finales del siglo XX en Spotify-, y también en la moda, donde el dúo de Manchester definió un estilo distintivo 'cool' y muy 'british' que fusionaba el armario de la clase trabajadora con influencias 'mod', de aquellos jóvenes de los 60 que escuchaban a los Beatles y se cortaban el pelo como el cuarteto de Liverpool. Los explosivos Gallagher han firmado la paz, o una tregua, y se suben juntos de nuevo a un escenario este viernes y sábado, 4 y 5 de julio, en Cardiff (Principality Stadium), en los dos primeros de los 14 conciertos que ofrecerán este verano en Europa.

En las antípodas del otro estilo dominante de los 90, el grunge originario de Seattle que lideró Nirvana, con sus guitarras distorsionadas, sus letras crudas e introspectivas, y sus 'looks' desaliñados de camisetas amplias, pantalones raídos y camisas de cuadros, el britpop buscaba revitalizar la escena británica con un sonido más optimista y melódico, una versión similar pero mejorada de las bandas de los años 60.

Los explosivos Gallagher han firmado la paz, o una tregua, y se suben juntos de nuevo a un escenario este viernes y sábado, 4 y 5 de julio, en Cardiff (Principality Stadium), en los dos primeros de los 14 conciertos que ofrecerán este verano en Europa. Los nostálgicos de aquella época, y sus hijos, la Generación Z que adora todo lo que huela a 'vintage', volverán a vestirse con aquellas prendas que tan bien refleja la película 'Trainspotting' (1996), o que tan bien vistieron otras bandas rivales de Oasis, como Blur, The Verve o Elastica.

La banda más representativa de britpop se separó en 2009, pero ha seguido muy presente musicalmente -sus dos primeros álbumes, 'Definitely Maybe' (1994) y '(What's the Story) Morning Glory?' (1995) están entre los discos más populares de finales del siglo XX en Spotify-, y también en la moda, donde el dúo de Manchester definió un estilo distintivo 'cool' y muy 'british' que fusionaba el armario de la clase trabajadora con influencias 'mod', de aquellos jóvenes de los 60 que escuchaban a los Beatles y se cortaban el pelo como el cuarteto de Liverpool. Los explosivos Gallagher han firmado la paz, o una tregua, y se suben juntos de nuevo a un escenario este viernes y sábado, 4 y 5 de julio, en Cardiff (Principality Stadium), en los dos primeros de los 14 conciertos que ofrecerán este verano en Europa. Los nostálgicos de aquella época, y sus hijos, la Generación Z que adora todo lo que huela a 'vintage', volverán a vestirse con aquellas prendas que tan bien refleja la película 'Trainspotting' (1996), o que tan bien vistieron otras bandas rivales de Oasis, como Blur, The Verve o Elastica.

La herencia cultural queda asegurada, pues, en la siguiente generación, en una campaña en la que también participan otros iconos británicos, como Cara Delevingne y Alexa Chung. El cantante Liam luce su propia parka Burberry, diseñada por Christopher Bailey, de la colección Primavera/Verano 2018, que se ha reeditado en una edición limitada, a la venta este mes de julio en tiendas físicas y 'online'. Además de parkas con bolsillos, otras prendas de abrigo, como anoraks y chubasqueros son muy representativas de este estilo, que también apuesta por prendas interiores icónicas, como los polos Fred Perry o Lacoste, chaquetas y camisetas deportivas, con especial querencia por los básicos retro de Adidas. Cultura popular y de fútbol, que la marca de las tres rayas, ha actualizado ahora con una nueva colección al alimón con los Gallagher. 'Original Forever' se llama la cápsula que consolida una relación de más de 30 años entre la marca y la banda originaria de Manchester. Nueva imagen juntos El lanzamiento, este pasado 22 de junio, ha coincidido con un vídeo del clásico 'Live Forever' (1994), que ensambla imágenes de conciertos actuales con otras de archivo de la banda, así como una foto nueva de los Gallagher juntos. Mirada desafiante sobre fondo negro. Nostalgia noventera en forma de chaquetas y conjuntos deportivos, zapatillas y sombreros de pescador. Además del icónico 'bucket hat' (por ejemplo, de Kangol), otros accesorios apuntalan el estilo britpop, como son las gafas de montura redonda y cristales tintados, al estilo John Lennon. Y, por supuesto, el peinado, conocido como 'Mod Hair' o 'Mod Cut'. Tras el revival' hace unos años del estilo ochentero del 'mullet', el peinado típico de los Gallagher se ha vuelto a poner de moda en barberías y redes sociales. Se caracteriza por un peinado más corto en los laterales, un flequillo recto y bien de volumen en la parte superior.

Practical, focused, and easy to consume, it's been thoughtfully designed to fit around buyers and deliver maximum value in minimal time. Taking place at the NEC Birmingham from 7–10 September 2025, this year's show recognises the pressures facing independent retailers, from rising costs and evolving customer behaviours to the demands of digital transformation and responds with a powerful new programme of over 30 short, high-impact sessions. Across the brand-new Retail Corner stage and Buyers Retreat, the agenda is packed with real-world strategies, future-facing trend intelligence, and expert-led workshops to help home, gift and fashion retailers buy smarter, sell better, and future-proof their businesses, while staying connected to the wider retail industry without missing a beat on the show floor. The agenda focuses on profit-driving insight, trend intelligence, and practical transformation, all curated with the realities of independent retail in mind. From social commerce and sustainability to licensing, merchandising and consumer psychology, the sessions offer buyers and brands a holistic view of where retail is headed, and how to stay ahead of it. This year's line-up is a masterclass in next-gen retail.

Priyanka Chopra with Nick Jonas Priyanka Chopra is not only an entertainer on-screen but off-screen too. On Wednesday (July 2), she posted a video hilariously listing some of the fashion mishaps actresses, including herself, face at red carpet events. Wearing a Burberry dress from its Fall/Winter '25 collection, Priyanka joked, “I'm an actress, of course, my nail falls off before the red carpet.” She even showed her broken nail as proof. Story continues below She followed it up with other hilarious fashion fails — like an actress's belt falling off on stage in public, or her 'plus one' stealing her look. The most hilarious moment, however, was when she showed off her outfit and added, “I'm an actress, of course I'm promoting my summer blockbuster in the mid-summer heat wearing Fall/Winter '25 Burberry.” And apparently, this wasn't just for laughs, it really happened. One fan commented, “Diva, I saw you handle the belt thing so subtly, it was iconic.” Another wrote, “You are an actress, of course you steal our hearts.” An internet user added, “You're Priyanka Chopra, of course you slay.” While she may have mocked the off-season timing of the look, she looked stunning in the belted fringe number, swaying and grooving joyfully. Her husband, Nick Jonas, also looked smitten. He shared a video of her dancing, and wrote, “Date night for Heads of State premiere in London.” Story continues below Earlier, for a press call, Priyanka was spotted in a plunging Dolce & Gabbana floral dress.

With U.S. equities back at highs and affluent consumers holding excess savings, the firm said, “Each 10% on U.S. equities (if maintained) adds 0.6-1.2% to U.S. consumption.” Tax cuts proposed in the ""Big, Beautiful Bill"" could further stimulate demand. However, China remains a headwind and “the housing outlook still looks problematic,” UBS warned, noting real estate wealth is a major driver of luxury consumption in China, which represents about 28% of global luxury demand. UBS continues to view the sector as a ""trading sector"" and sees upside surprises from Buy-rated Burberry (LON:BRBY) and Richemont (LON:0QMU) (SIX:CFR) in the upcoming earnings season. Hermes and Richemont “both look cheap” on a P/E relative basis, while China's Anta Sports (HK:2020) is highlighted as attractively valued. Despite the upgrade, UBS refrains from an outright overweight call, citing macroeconomic, valuation, and currency risks.

mov_D2EB42B5B72CAA641BA21BFBFA7CDFDB,"  Kate Middleton paid a visit to the Wellbeing Garden at Colchester Hospital on Wednesday in Colchester, England. The British royal family member, who has taken on more public royal engagements since completing her chemotherapy treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer in September, spent some time speaking with staff and planting flowers in the garden. For the special outing, she opted for a select few designers for her business casual attire. The royal wore the Wind Hunter Charmer double-breasted pinstriped grain de poudre blazer courtesy of Blazé Milano. The stripe motif perfectly complemented Middleton's shirt. The Princess of Wales also wore the “Capri” striped cotton-poplin shirt in tan and white by Ralph Lauren, a designer whose suits she has also styled in the recent past. Middleton paired her shirt and blazer with a pair of chocolate brown pants with a belt. As for other elements of her attire, the royal wore a pair of metallic-trimmed leather sneakers courtesy of Veja. Her jewelry consisted of a Cartier bracelet and white gold earrings, along with a necklace by London-based brand Auree Jewelry. Ralph Lauren, a designer also worn by Middleton's sister-in-law, Meghan Markle, has several pieces featured in Kate Middleton's royal wardrobe. Last April, Middleton wore the “Schmitt” herringbone tweed blazer in olive courtesy of the American designer. The Princess of Wales wore the jacket during her joint visit to the Ardura Community Forest in Ardura, Isle of Mull, Scotland, alongside her husband, Prince William. The trip coincided with the royal couple's 14th wedding anniversary. Known for her power suiting moments and royal rewears, Middleton's embrace of the business casual style created an approachable effect for her latest solo royal engagement. The combination of the Ralph Lauren shirt with the Blazé Milano blazer and Veja sneakers crafted a business casual aesthetic that still catered to Middleton's approach to fashion and style.

mov_1BC01FA250BB84C25B8630D0B10D5B8D,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Liam Gallagher has issued a public apology to fans after sparking outrage for tweeting out a racial slur. The singer, 52, is only days away from the start of the long-awaited Oasis reunion tour, with him set to take the stage with brother Noel, 58, for the first time in 15 years, on Friday in Cardiff. However, the famously outspoken and controversial star left many of his Asian fans hurt and offended, after tweeting out the derogatory phrase 'chingchong'. The slur is a derogatory imitation of the Chinese language and is used mock or denigrate people of East Asian descent. In the past both Shaquille O'Neal and Rosie O'Donnell have drawn public ire and issued apologies for using the offensive term. Liam appeared to tweet the phrase on Tuesday, responding to critics by claiming: 'it's an ancient thought process get on it', and responding to one fan warning him he'd be cancelled by saying: 'Whatever'. But he seemed to have learned the error of his ways by Wednesday, after deleting the original tweet and taking to X once again to apologise and insist his use of the slur wasn't 'intentional'. He wrote: 'Sorry if I offended anyone with my tweet before it wasn't intentional you know I love you all and I do not discriminate. peace and love LG x'. However, the damage was done for many, with some less than impressed by his apology and calling his behaviour 'disappointing'. They took to social media to say: 'My friend once went to Liam Gallagher's Knebworth gig alone, and got assaulted by racists. It was never just a wrong word. It sounds okay to you because you've never been scared by people calling you racist slurs. Grown ups should know it's never right to defend racism'. 'why are so many white people defending Liam Gallagher and saying he did nothing wrong?? Just because he sang your favourite songs doesn't mean you can excuse blatant racism.' 'liam gallagher deciding to get cancelled 3 days before their first gig since 2009'; 'liam gallagher could drop a nuclear bomb and *those* oasis fans would be like ""silly liam!!! its alright he didn't know"".' 'I mean i love oasis as much as the next guy and i cant deny the fondness for Liam in my heart BUT he posts ""rastas"" like every single day as a white guy...we shoulda seen this in the cards for him'. 'who would have thought in 2025 at the ripe age of 52 liam gallagher would still consider casual racism as being edgy.' 'It's fine that Liam apologized because it's the least the offended Chinese fans deserve, but if you're not Asian you shouldn't tell Liam that there was no mistake on his part, and that his apologies aren't necessary, YES they are necessary'. 'I personally don't care for his half-hearted apologies. He clearly doesn't care when his only responses to people calling him out on his previous remarks were “whatever”. That really says it all.' 'Those white people who forgive Liam Gallagher for tweeting “chingchong” certainly haven't been called by this racist, derogatory, disgusting name on the streets, multiple times, unprovoked, just for looking East Asian.' 'he was saying whatever in the replies yesterday but ig being scrubbed from a burberry campaign will do wonders for one's solemnity and reflection'. 'i appreciate the apology but the original tweet and the dismissiveness in his replies to ppl rightfully critiquing him still leave a bad taste hopefully he learns from this but it's just truly disappointing'. It comes as Oasis have arrived in Cardiff ahead of the first gig of their hotly-anticipated reunion tour, after a last minute change to the plans. The iconic Britpop band will perform stadium shows for the first time in 15 years across the United Kingdom, Ireland, Japan, South Korea and North, Central and South America, where it will conclude with a show at São Paulo's Estádio do Morumbi on November 23. And on Monday, fans became convinced that the duo had already arrived in Wales to sound check at the stadium after people heard music coming from inside. It has also been revealed the brothers have enlisted new bandmates for the tour, with drummer Joey Waronker and guitarists Andy Bell, Gem Archer and Paul 'Bonehead' Arthurs on board. A source told The Mirror: 'With a new lineup and it being such a huge first show, the boys will do some songs inside the venue too. 'Some tours would start with a smaller show or take a week or two to get into the groove again- but there is no time for that, and also Liam and Noel want every night to be massive. 'This is such a huge comeback show, and they are taking it very seriously, it all points to it being an incredible comeback tour.'","Have YOU got a story?

When he departed Jacobs last month, he wrote on LinkedIn, “These years have marked some of the company's most profitable and transformative eras, and I'm incredibly proud to have been part of it.” Rizzolo claimed in the post that he had helped shape some of Jacobs' major milestones, including “the meteoric rise of The Tote Bag, the revival of Stam (a popular bag) and Beauty, the re-launch of Ready-to-Wear, Footwear and Jewelry, the cultural impact of Heaven.” Earlier, Rizzolo was divisional vice president of global merchandising at Michael Kors and before that he was with Gucci as divisional merchandise manager. Other roles included buyer for Burberry, associate merchandiser at Calvin Klein, and assistant merchandiser at Gap, where he spent nearly eight years. Neither Rizzolo nor Alexander Wang could be reached for comment Wednesday morning. In a LinkedIn post, Rizzolo said he joined Wang on Tuesday. “This brand has held a place in my heart for two decades — genre-defying, culturally sharp, relentlessly creative. To take on this role alongside Alex and lead this exceptionally talented team into a new chapter is an honor I welcome with gratitude and energy. “I have always been inspired by the passion that fuels founder-led brands, and I'm thrilled to match Alex's drive and dedication to the brand and the business. The next chapter starts now,” he wrote. In a WWD story in December 2023, Wang said it was searching for a new chief executive officer. The company's adviser has been Paula Sutter (former president of Diane von Furstenberg), who's been advising the brand for over 15 years. Sutter couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday. In the 2023 WWD story, Wang said he had gone through “a complete transformation both personally, and through work,” after being accused of sexual misconduct and sexual assault in 2000. The company, which had moved into sprawling offices at 139 Beekman Street in 2023, was recommitting to its North American business. It had committed to building the bodywear category, opening freestanding stores in North America and strengthening its online business. It had also planned growth in Europe in 2024.

mov_B8190A65D7906AA719AFEE1CA9EA609A,"  Mass layoffs continue to sweep through global industries in 2025, with technology, finance, retail, and energy giants announcing deep cuts. The reductions are being driven by a mix of cost-cutting, restructuring, and the growing impact of artificial intelligence on business models. According to the World Economic Forum, 41% of global companies expect to reduce their workforce within five years due to AI. While AI-related roles in big data, fintech, and machine learning are set to grow, many traditional jobs are being phased out or reassigned. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is trimming about 200 jobs to better align its resources, while Jack Dorsey's fintech firm Block is letting go of 1,000 workers across its brands, including Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Ally Financial is laying off around 500 employees as part of a “right-sizing” strategy, while Automattic, parent company of Tumblr and WordPress, is cutting 16% of its workforce. CEO Matt Mullenweg noted, “While our revenue continues to grow, Automattic operates in a highly competitive market, and technology is evolving at unprecedented levels.” In aerospace, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is laying off 10% of staff to improve manufacturing focus, while Boeing plans to cut 400 roles from its moon rocket programme in line with NASA's delayed Artemis missions. Retail is feeling the pinch too. Burberry is axing 1,700 roles after slipping into a loss, and Kohl's has reduced 10% of corporate positions amid sluggish sales. Starbucks, meanwhile, laid off 1,100 corporate staff in February. Tech continues to face a mixed outlook. Meta is targeting “low-performers” in ongoing cuts, Intel is slashing 15% of its Foundry workforce, and Microsoft has made multiple rounds of layoffs, with another 9,000 planned in July. Salesforce and Workday have both cut over 1,000 roles, citing shifts towards AI-focused growth. Other notable companies undertaking cuts include Disney, GrubHub, PwC, Porsche, Sonos, and UPS. Many cite operational efficiency, automation, and changing market conditions as primary reasons. The layoff trend shows no signs of slowing as companies brace for an AI-powered future and a volatile economic landscape.","Mass layoffs continue to sweep through global industries in 2025, with technology, finance, retail, and energy giants announcing deep cuts.

Priyanka Chopra laughs about wardrobe malfunction At the Heads of State event in London, Priyanka Chopra dazzled in a bold fringe dress from Burberry's Fall/Winter 2025 collection.

A child with neon eyes stares into your soul and says, “Moisturise or perish.” You swipe up. You have absolutely no idea what you just witnessed. No, this isn't a fever dream. It's advertising today. Surrealism, once confined to arthouse films and niche magazines, is now front and centre in brand storytelling. Globally, big brands are tossing the old playbook. Gucci is making its models float mid-air, while Diesel has a freakish-style house. These ads are starting to look more like hallucinations than product promotions. Burberry made a film called 'Night Creatures' where people on a night walk get picked up by a mysterious creature and float in the air. Weird, absurd, and nothing to do with the brand. [embedded content] “People are tired of seeing the same kind of content every day”, says Rohan Mukherjee, Co-founder of byooooob. “Surrealism feels fresh because it's unpredictable… it reflects the kind of chaos we experience online and offline.” [embedded content] It's not just visual chaos for chaos's sake, it's intentional. Surrealism disorients, then delights. It mirrors the fragmented way we consume media, fast, fractured, and emotion-first. A LinkedIn column by Sami Viitamäki argues that “nonsense marketing” is outperforming traditional logic-led storytelling because it allows for deeper engagement through emotion, humour, and intrigue. “Surrealism offers us a gateway into our subconscious, a portal into dreams,” adds Shai Samantey, Co-founder & Director at Jungle. “Exploring these realms… gives one a bigger canvas to create.” [embedded content] What is driving this shift? One reason for this visual shift is technology. AI has cracked open surrealism's gate, allowing more creators to play in dreamlike, illogical spaces. Midjourney, DALL·E and Runway lets creators make bizarre visions without needing heavy design or VFX. “AI made surreal visuals more accessible. Anyone with an idea can create strange, dreamlike images without needing to know design software,” says Mukherjee. Samantey agrees, “As filmmakers, anything in our wildest imagination can now be brought to life. AI not only helps you build your vision but also reimagines it in ways you may not have seen before.” But not everyone sees AI as the magic bullet. “We are just scratching the surface. Even our most advanced AI models are nowhere near the complexity of the human brain,” says Ram Madhvani, Co-founder, Director, and Producer at Equinox Films. Pranoy Kanojia, VP Strategy, Enormous Brands, adds, “AI has supercharged this. The aesthetics of brain rot have improved, blurring the lines of absurd and real.” There's even a name for this online explosion of weird, AI-crafted content: AI Slop — a genre built on bizarre juxtapositions and visual overload, engineered to keep you scrolling. And young audiences, especially Gen Z, are leaning into it. Mukherjee says, “Mostly younger audiences who are online a lot. They're used to content that moves fast, breaks rules, and doesn't always make sense on the surface. Surrealism speaks to that mindset — it's emotional, visual, and leaves space for interpretation. “At the end of the day, we are all dreamers,” adds Samantey. “A good piece of content that uses surrealism can be appreciated and consumed by all audiences.” Studies support this. According to a YPulse survey, 73% of Gen Z actively seek 'visually bold, weird, or unexpected' content. Data from Kantar's 2024 Creative Effectiveness Awards also adds a strategic layer, ads with 'Bizarrely Bold' visuals like Deliveroo's surreal 'Octoman' featuring an octopus on a date via delivery, consistently outperform for attention and memorability.

Even our most advanced AI models are nowhere near the complexity of the human brain,” says Ram Madhvani, Co-founder, Director, and Producer at Equinox Films. Pranoy Kanojia, VP Strategy, Enormous Brands, adds, “AI has supercharged this. The aesthetics of brain rot have improved, blurring the lines of absurd and real.” There's even a name for this online explosion of weird, AI-crafted content: AI Slop — a genre built on bizarre juxtapositions and visual overload, engineered to keep you scrolling. And young audiences, especially Gen Z, are leaning into it. Mukherjee says, “Mostly younger audiences who are online a lot. They're used to content that moves fast, breaks rules, and doesn't always make sense on the surface. Surrealism speaks to that mindset — it's emotional, visual, and leaves space for interpretation. “At the end of the day, we are all dreamers,” adds Samantey. “A good piece of content that uses surrealism can be appreciated and consumed by all audiences.” Studies support this. According to a YPulse survey, 73% of Gen Z actively seek 'visually bold, weird, or unexpected' content. Data from Kantar's 2024 Creative Effectiveness Awards also adds a strategic layer, ads with 'Bizarrely Bold' visuals like Deliveroo's surreal 'Octoman' featuring an octopus on a date via delivery, consistently outperform for attention and memorability.

Amid the featured talent are Liam Gallagher, Goldie, Seungmin, Loyle Carner, Cara Delevingne, plus the next generation of Gallaghers: Lennon, Molly Moorish-Gallagher, and Gene. The aesthetic is undeniably '90s, drawing on archival footage mixed with stylised shots showcasing the spirit of a festival, set to a soundtrack of Liquid's rave-era classic 'Sweet Harmony'. “Burberry has always been a part of the fabric of the UK… you see it [Burberry check] on the underside of a hat or the inside of a jacket.

Defending champions the Utiku Old Boys went out on their shield at Macnab Domain last Saturday as the season's great success story, McCrea Scanning Counties, secured their away semifinal against the Forest 360 Marist Knights. Leading 17-3, Counties showed all their guile to eventually end Utiku's title reign 26-17, with their try-scorers including prop Frazer Matthews, flanker Tamati Aramoana and their marquee player, Lindsay Horrocks. Counties did lose to the Knights 40-19 in the first week of the competition, but they proceeded to lift the Whanganui Rugby Challenge Shield off fellow semifinalists Direct Connect Marist Celtic and rattle off five straight defences, before losing by one point to the top qualifiers, McCarthy's Transport Ruapehu. Celtic, in their 50th anniversary season, have come through a competitive mid-table pack to beat their Spriggens Park neighbours, the Seales Winslow Pirates, 36-19 and earn the trip up to face Ruapehu. A family-oriented team, Celtic are skippered by rugged veteran Maikara McDonnell, while first five-eighths Wineti McDonnell slotted five kicks in the quarter-final, with two tries credited between them. Prop Jeremy Seal, winger Ranginamu Lambert and centre Te Oranga Whareaitu also dotted down. It is historic to have both Marist teams in the semifinals, as the 2024 runners-up, the Knights, are determined not to be denied the crown. Their 73-16 quarter-final win over Kelso Hunterville saw No8 Brandon Burberry score a hat-trick, while standout fullback Joey Devine had 16 points from two tries and three conversions. Winger Heemi Metekingi, centre Epeli Delasau, hooker Cyprien Bernard, prop Raponi Tofa, flanker Kane Hinga and reserve Benidito Vakaruru also scored. Hosting Celtic, the undefeated Ruapehu will appreciate the upstart Border Seniors gave them more of a test than would have been expected in their 26-0 quarter-final win. Their try-scorers were flanker Taipari Wirepa, winger Tahatika Te Riaki, hooker Aaron Wilson and skipper Kahl Elers-Green. Women's competition The fourth semifinalists for the 2025 Tasman Tanning Women's competition was confirmed last week as Hunterville claimed a historic playoff spot in their first season of existence. The Rangitikei-based club side must now face the undefeated AGC Training Marist Clovers, who signalled their clear intentions after a big victory over defending champions Byfords Construction Taihape. Sitting three points behind fellow newcomers the Heidi Macaulay Realty Bulls heading into the final round-robin games, Hunterville secured their spot with a 61-0 win over the Marton Queenbeez at Marton Park. Flanker and skipper Brooke Henderson scored four tries and kicked a conversion, while second five Charlie Bennett got a hat-trick. The other try-scorers were centre Gracen Coe, winger Amoe Harawira, halfback Stacey Jones and flanker Tia Karatau-Kiu, while first five Maraea Graham slotted two conversions. Hunterville knew by Saturday that a win would take them to fourth, as Silks Audit Ratana had done them the favour the night before at Cooks Gardens by beating the Bulls 86-0. No8 Hayley Gabriel scored a hat-trick, with doubles coming from flanker Tash Kingi, centre Mikayla Heka, reserve Lexes Martin Tekoari and first five-eights Armani Martin, who also added a conversion. Ratana will now make the trek to Memorial Park to see if they can tip up Taihape. Taihape will be stinging from their 64-7 defeat to Marist at Cooks Gardens last Friday night. Second five-eighths Tiana Kauika scored a hat-trick, while fullback Alice Ireton had a 24-point haul from two tries and seven conversions. Marist's other tries were by prop and skipper Sosoli Talawadua, prop Waimarie Rauhina, No8 Lavenia Nauga-Grey, centre Awatere McLean-Wanoa and winger Kesaia Siganisucu, with Taihape's try coming from lock Leigha Stormont.","The Tasman Tanning Senior competition has reached the penultimate weekend, with four teams looking to punch their ticket to Cooks Gardens and crown a fresh champion for 2025.

The Rangitikei-based club side must now face the undefeated AGC Training Marist Clovers, who signalled their clear intentions after a big victory over defending champions Byfords Construction Taihape. Sitting three points behind fellow newcomers the Heidi Macaulay Realty Bulls heading into the final round-robin games, Hunterville secured their spot with a 61-0 win over the Marton Queenbeez at Marton Park. Flanker and skipper Brooke Henderson scored four tries and kicked a conversion, while second five Charlie Bennett got a hat-trick. The other try-scorers were centre Gracen Coe, winger Amoe Harawira, halfback Stacey Jones and flanker Tia Karatau-Kiu, while first five Maraea Graham slotted two conversions. Hunterville knew by Saturday that a win would take them to fourth, as Silks Audit Ratana had done them the favour the night before at Cooks Gardens by beating the Bulls 86-0. No8 Hayley Gabriel scored a hat-trick, with doubles coming from flanker Tash Kingi, centre Mikayla Heka, reserve Lexes Martin Tekoari and first five-eights Armani Martin, who also added a conversion. Ratana will now make the trek to Memorial Park to see if they can tip up Taihape. Taihape will be stinging from their 64-7 defeat to Marist at Cooks Gardens last Friday night. Second five-eighths Tiana Kauika scored a hat-trick, while fullback Alice Ireton had a 24-point haul from two tries and seven conversions. Marist's other tries were by prop and skipper Sosoli Talawadua, prop Waimarie Rauhina, No8 Lavenia Nauga-Grey, centre Awatere McLean-Wanoa and winger Kesaia Siganisucu, with Taihape's try coming from lock Leigha Stormont.",2025-07-03 18:04:55,en,PRINT,,,,,1,False,False,"The text is a detailed rugby match report that only mentions ""Brandon Burberry"" as a player's name.

Muchas personas usan el término “perfume” para referirse a cualquier fragancia, pero no todas tienen la misma concentración ni duración. Las diferencias entre un perfume, un eau de parfum y un eau de toilette no solo radican en su nombre, sino también en su composición, intensidad y uso recomendado. Conocer estas variaciones es clave para elegir la opción más adecuada según el estilo de vida, el clima y el presupuesto. En el mercado mexicano, existe una amplia oferta que incluye desde marcas internacionales de alta gama hasta opciones accesibles y funcionales. Cada formato tiene sus ventajas dependiendo del contexto: si se busca una fragancia duradera para un evento especial, o algo más fresco y liviano para el día a día. Comprender estas diferencias ayuda a evitar errores comunes, cómo comprar una fragancia demasiado intensa para el uso diario. Este artículo detalla las particularidades de cada tipo de producto, presenta ejemplos representativos y ofrece recomendaciones prácticas para encontrar la fragancia ideal, ya sea de firmas de lujo o de marcas populares como los perfumes Aeropostale, Calvin Klein, Zara o Tous. Diferencias fundamentales entre las concentraciones Cada tipo de fragancia tiene una formulación distinta que influye directamente en su duración y proyección. ¿Qué es un perfume? El perfume o extrait de parfum es el formato más concentrado. Su contenido de aceites esenciales suele estar entre el 20 % y el 30 %, lo que le confiere una duración prolongada, a veces superior a 12 horas en la piel. Este tipo de fragancia es más costosa, pero también más persistente y sofisticada. Ejemplos comunes de perfumes concentrados incluyen Chanel No. 5 Extrait, Dior J'adore L'Absolu o Amouage Interlude Woman. Por su intensidad, se recomienda aplicarlos con moderación y reservarlos para eventos especiales o climas fríos, donde pueden desplegar todo su potencial sin resultar abrumadores. ¿Qué es un eau de parfum? El eau de parfum (EDP) es uno de los formatos más populares por su equilibrio entre duración y precio. Su concentración oscila entre el 15 % y el 20 %, lo que permite una fijación duradera de 6 a 8 horas, dependiendo del tipo de piel y las condiciones ambientales. Marcas como Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Carolina Herrera Good Girl, Montblanc Signature o los perfumes Aeropostale en su versión EDP son buenos ejemplos de esta categoría. Estas fragancias son ideales para el uso diario en ambientes cerrados o para quienes desean un aroma que permanezca durante toda la jornada. ¿Qué es un eau de toilette? El eau de toilette (EDT) contiene entre un 5 % y un 15 % de aceites aromáticos. Esto la convierte en una opción más ligera, con una duración que va de 3 a 5 horas. Es perfecta para climas cálidos, momentos casuales o como fragancia de reaplicación a lo largo del día. Algunos EDT populares son CK One, Versace Pour Femme Dylan Blue, Tous Touch o Light Blue de Dolce & Gabbana en su versión ligera. Son recomendables para quienes prefieren aromas sutiles y frescos que no invadan el espacio personal. Aplicaciones prácticas según el estilo de vida Cada formato responde a un tipo de uso diferente, según la ocasión y la rutina personal. Fragancias para el trabajo y el día a día Para entornos laborales o actividades cotidianas, el eau de toilette suele ser la mejor elección. Su ligereza evita que el aroma resulte molesto para los demás, y su frescura aporta una sensación de limpieza. También es común reaplicar este tipo de fragancia a lo largo del día sin saturar. Marcas como Zara, Burberry Weekend, Benetton Colors, o los perfumes Aeropostale presentan opciones adecuadas para este perfil de uso, especialmente en oficinas o ambientes escolares. Fragancias para eventos especiales Cuando se necesita una fragancia más notoria y duradera, como en bodas, cenas o reuniones nocturnas, lo ideal es optar por un perfume o un buen eau de parfum. Estas versiones logran mayor permanencia y proyección, creando una estela más distintiva. Algunas recomendaciones incluyen Lancome La Vie Est Belle, Tom Ford Black Orchid, Mugler Alien o Elie Saab Le Parfum. Estos productos se comportan bien en pieles secas o en climas templados.

Estas leyendas aparecen junto al nombre de la fragancia, por lo general en francés. En caso de duda, también se puede consultar el porcentaje de concentración en la lista de ingredientes. Además, algunas marcas ofrecen el mismo aroma en diferentes concentraciones. Por ejemplo, Chanel Coco Mademoiselle tiene versiones tanto EDP cómo EDT, cada una con una estructura olfativa ligeramente distinta, pero fiel al ADN del perfume.

n17ylw6,"  Well, as you should know, a large fraction--but not majority--of people here purchase luxury handbags associated with Houses that have been in the industry for a *long* time. Your brand, unfortunately, won't reach a cult following any time soon; it takes decades to build and maintain that. So I would recommend you *not* rely on logo hardware or monograms of any sort. Every brand has a ""story"". It's a marketing tactic. I recommend you come up with one, and it doesn't have to be 100% true. You are welcome to embellish. You'd be surprised what a story can do. Chanel was a dying brand until Karl Lagerfeld took over. He reinvented the lore for the dying house and made Coco Chanel seem like the pinnacle of upper class from rags to riches (while simultaneously hiding her Nazi connections). What he did for the brand is immeasurable. Anyway, yeah, a good story always helps. Pick out your niche. What differentiates you from ""other"" handbag brands? Every brand is known for *something* . I wouldn't recommend going for ""all our pieces are unique and handcrafted by the finest artisans"" or ""made with the higest quality leathers"" as that has been over done and means very little to those actually into handbags. You need to pick a group--like age range and social economic status--you wish to appeal to. Have a distinct House code/style. You want to stick out. Having themes in your collection or iconic prints will help people recognise your product from afar. Think Chanel's quilted pattern, Burberry's Nova Check print, Versace's embellishments and safety pins, etc. All these repeat features help create world building, as we call it in the fashion world. Also, social media. I can't stress that enough.","Well, as you should know, a large fraction--but not majority--of people here purchase luxury handbags associated with Houses that have been in the industry for a *long* time. Your brand, unfortunately, won't reach a cult following any time soon; it takes decades to build and maintain that. So I would recommend you *not* rely on logo hardware or monograms of any sort. Every brand has a ""story"". It's a marketing tactic. I recommend you come up with one, and it doesn't have to be 100% true. You are welcome to embellish. You'd be surprised what a story can do. Chanel was a dying brand until Karl Lagerfeld took over. He reinvented the lore for the dying house and made Coco Chanel seem like the pinnacle of upper class from rags to riches (while simultaneously hiding her Nazi connections). What he did for the brand is immeasurable. Anyway, yeah, a good story always helps. Pick out your niche. What differentiates you from ""other"" handbag brands? Every brand is known for *something* . I wouldn't recommend going for ""all our pieces are unique and handcrafted by the finest artisans"" or ""made with the higest quality leathers"" as that has been over done and means very little to those actually into handbags.

mov_744E83C09D2D2D5A64773AFAFE2BE328,"  Burberry used to be classic British, associated with royalty, the upper classes and conservatism. Not anymore. The brand has embedded itself in the heart of fashion culture – and popular culture – with advertising that appeals to a young trend-aware audience. Extending that push is its celebration of festival season – because the clothes worn by pop stars and models are the clothes the young trend-aware audience wants to wear. Revolver's Kim Gehrig directs the brand's newest commercial, Burberry Festival, a candid view of the British fashion festival season and a nostalgic yet contemporary tribute to the 1990s British cultural movement known as Cool Britannia. The film intersperses new and archival footage with stills by photographer, Drew Vickers, all set to a soundtrack of Liquid's rave-era classic, Sweet Harmony. Highlighting Burberry's fashion credentials are Liam Gallagher, Goldie, Seungmin, Loyle Carner, Cara Delevingne, Alexa Chung, as well Gallagher offspring, Lennon, Molly Moorish-Gallagher and Gene. The campaign highlights the enduring influence of Burberry on music and youth culture, reinforcing its position as the essential uniform for festival-goers. A highlight of the campaign is Liam Gallagher wearing his own Burberry parka from Christopher Bailey's 2018 Spring/Summer collection — a piece set to be reissued in a limited run globally from July.

In the last 4 months, I went all in tried over 150+ decants, visited a few local perfumeries, and explored and owned tons of perfume oils beyond what I'm sharing in this post. After a lot of research (and a bit of obsession), I ended up collecting these fragrances, and let's just say… it became quite the addiction! That said, I've decided to hit pause and not buy any more fragrances for the rest of the year (with one exception that might arrive in the next couple of days). I'll still be around and happy to help anyone here however I can. Thanks again for being such a great part of this journey! **Note**: I am not an expert , I trust my nose more than reviews, please do research or test fragrances before you buy, I am from Middle east / Asia English is not my native language, I apologize in advance for any mistakes i try to explain this in my words without using any AI or correction tool. I am reviewing all fragrances after giving them time to mature. From Top Left to Right: 1. **Icon by Dunhill**: Really Good citrusy, Aromatic and floral scent. A good alternative for those who don't like sweet or overly citrusy scents for summer. 2. **1 Million Prive:** The most complimented one on my list, absolutely amazing winter scent with sweet and tobacco notes; I failed to find anything that can beat that fragrance. 3. **1 Million Elixir:** Very sweet and creamy vanilla with colorful floral tones, especially on the dry down. Lasts a long time and projection is strong. **4. **   **Jasoor:** Clone of VUBIR Coral Fantasy Long Lasting with Good projection, Very Versatile for year-round wear except very hot evenings. **5. **   **Asad Bourbon:** Clone that covers VUBIR Intense, Most Wanted and Stronger with you. Smells cozy and rich. Feels confident and warm. **6. **   **Khamrah :** Amazing Scent, Sweet,  Warm , Cozy with Vanilla and amber. 7. **Khamrah Dukhan:** I tried Liquid Burn, and to my nose, it smells quite similar that same warm, spicy DNA. But Khamrah Dukhan was much cheaper, so I went for it. It's incredibly long-lasting and feels like a spicier, less sweet version of Khamrah. If the sweetness in the original Khamrah isn't your thing, this might be a better fit. Honestly, it's underrated and didn't get the recognition it deserves from early buyers or reviewers. This one needs more attention, it's a hidden gem. 8. **Alpine Homme Sport**: Clone of Allure Homme Sport, as a Sporty scent both last 4-5 hours, and it's enough for a sports session, very good gym scent. 9. **CDN Precieux:** Clone of Aventus Absolu with Twist, Great performance and quality scent better and smoother when compared with Supremacy CE but costs more and feel more expensive **10. ** **Mont Blanc Starwalker:** absolute masterpiece a good night time / bedtime scent. Calming and relaxing, Hyped for a reason very unique scent. **11. ** **Dunhill Desire for a man:** Apple, Citrus and Rose based scent, classic cheap summer scent suitable for any age. 12. **L'Homme by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of L'Homme Lacoste, long lasting, sweet, citrusy fresh scent. FD is a small local perfumery in my area. 13. **L'Homme Intense by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of Dior Homme Intense, Dior Homme intense clones were mostly sold out and its hard to get them in my country so i visited a local perfumery where they had this clone its using same french oils used by other clone houses.

mov_E75F102C73A5CC1E0FADCBE53E3C853B,"  SPR_COMBO[tr]İngiliz moda markası Burberry, yaz festivallerine adanmış yeni kampanyasıyla sezonu karşılıyor. Kampanya filminde Oasis'in solisti Liam Gallagher, müzisyen Goldie, Loyle Carner, Seungmin, model ve sunucu Alexa Chung, Cara Delevingne ve Gallagher ailesinin yeni nesil üyeleri Lennon, Molly Moorish-Gallagher ve Gene yer alıyor. Film, Burberry'nin müzikle ve Britanya gençlik kültürüyle olan güçlü bağını yeniden gözler önüne seriyor. Reklam filmi, Kim Gehrig yönetmenliğinde ve Somesuch yapımcılığında hayata geçirildi. İngiltere'ye özgü festival deneyiminin çamurlu, enerjik ve gerçekçi atmosferine odaklanıyor. Alexa Chung'un da dediği gibi: “Festival havasında hep biraz seyyar tuvalet kokusu olur ama onunla birlikte bir de heyecanın tatlı kokusu yayılır.” Glastonbury gibi festivaller, bir yandan telefon şarj çadırları gibi günümüz ihtiyaçlarını karşılarken, bir yandan da hâlâ ilkel ve özgür bir deneyim sunmaya devam ediyor. 90'ların ruhu geri dönüyor Filmde 90'lı yılların enerjisi hâkim. Arşiv görüntüleriyle günümüzden kareler bir araya getirilerek özgün bir festival anlatısı kurulmuş. Müzik seçiminde ise rave döneminin unutulmaz parçası Liquid imzalı “Sweet Harmony” yer alıyor. Görsellikte ise o döneme ait sade ama güçlü bir stil anlayışı öne çıkıyor. Burberry'nin İngiliz kültüründeki kalıcı etkisine değinen Goldie, filmde şöyle diyor: “Burberry her zaman bu ülkenin dokusunun bir parçası olmuştur. Bir şapkanın ya da ceketin iç astarında bile onu görebilirsiniz. Zamanla bu iç detaylar dışa taşar.” Marka, hem stil hem kültür anlamında müziğe ve festivallere yön veren bir rol üstlenmeye devam ediyor. Liam Gallagher'ın parkası geri dönüyor Kampanyanın bir parçası olarak Liam Gallagher'ın 2018 yılında giydiği Burberry parkası sınırlı sayıda yeniden satışa sunulacak. Burberry Kreatif Direktörü Daniel Lee kampanyayı şu sözlerle özetliyor: “Burberry, yaz festivallerinin tam merkezinde yer alıyor. Hem bireysel bir ifade biçimi hem de festival katılımcılarının vazgeçilmez kıyafeti haline geliyor.” Yeni kampanya, Burberry'nin müzik, stil ve İngiliz kültürünün iç içe geçtiği festival geleneğindeki yerini bir kez daha pekiştiriyor.","SPR_COMBO[tr]İngiliz moda markası Burberry, yaz festivallerine adanmış yeni kampanyasıyla sezonu karşılıyor.

Film, Burberry'nin müzikle ve Britanya gençlik kültürüyle olan güçlü bağını yeniden gözler önüne seriyor. Reklam filmi, Kim Gehrig yönetmenliğinde ve Somesuch yapımcılığında hayata geçirildi. İngiltere'ye özgü festival deneyiminin çamurlu, enerjik ve gerçekçi atmosferine odaklanıyor. Alexa Chung'un da dediği gibi: “Festival havasında hep biraz seyyar tuvalet kokusu olur ama onunla birlikte bir de heyecanın tatlı kokusu yayılır.” Glastonbury gibi festivaller, bir yandan telefon şarj çadırları gibi günümüz ihtiyaçlarını karşılarken, bir yandan da hâlâ ilkel ve özgür bir deneyim sunmaya devam ediyor. 90'ların ruhu geri dönüyor Filmde 90'lı yılların enerjisi hâkim. Arşiv görüntüleriyle günümüzden kareler bir araya getirilerek özgün bir festival anlatısı kurulmuş. Müzik seçiminde ise rave döneminin unutulmaz parçası Liquid imzalı “Sweet Harmony” yer alıyor. Görsellikte ise o döneme ait sade ama güçlü bir stil anlayışı öne çıkıyor. Burberry'nin İngiliz kültüründeki kalıcı etkisine değinen Goldie, filmde şöyle diyor: “Burberry her zaman bu ülkenin dokusunun bir parçası olmuştur. Bir şapkanın ya da ceketin iç astarında bile onu görebilirsiniz. Zamanla bu iç detaylar dışa taşar.” Marka, hem stil hem kültür anlamında müziğe ve festivallere yön veren bir rol üstlenmeye devam ediyor. Liam Gallagher'ın parkası geri dönüyor Kampanyanın bir parçası olarak Liam Gallagher'ın 2018 yılında giydiği Burberry parkası sınırlı sayıda yeniden satışa sunulacak. Burberry Kreatif Direktörü Daniel Lee kampanyayı şu sözlerle özetliyor: “Burberry, yaz festivallerinin tam merkezinde yer alıyor. Hem bireysel bir ifade biçimi hem de festival katılımcılarının vazgeçilmez kıyafeti haline geliyor.” Yeni kampanya, Burberry'nin müzik, stil ve İngiliz kültürünün iç içe geçtiği festival geleneğindeki yerini bir kez daha pekiştiriyor.",2025-07-04 08:13:57,tr,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"The content is highly relevant to Burberry, discussing their latest summer festival campaign that deeply explores the brand's connection to British music, youth culture, and fashion.

mov_5F44ADECB935A969A501A6A992416630,"  Five years ago, she knew nothing about tennis – today, she's become a star at her boyfriend's show More than two decades ago, the term 'WAG' exploded into pop-culture consciousness. An acronym for the 'wives and girlfriends' of high-profile athletes, what began as an entertaining sports-adjacent moment quickly become thought of as a negative term. The original WAGs – Victoria Beckham, Colleen Rooney and Cheryl Cole – were blamed for the England football team's 2006 World Cup failure. A Spanish newspaper branded them ""hooligans with Visas"". The same media outlets that branded them poor role models also only saw them through the prism of their partners. Today, the word is being redefined through the lens of Morgan Riddle, the 27-year-old girlfriend of the American tennis star Taylor Fritz, currently rated the world No 5. She might be there supporting Fritz at every game, but she's also the star of her own story – a woman credited with bringing tennis to a younger, female-led demographic. The New York Times called her “the most famous woman in men's tennis” and her TikTok and Instagram combined following totals over a million. If Wimbledon has become a less stuffy, more stylish game in the past few years, Riddle is the new poster girl for it. Her accessible social media presence and her show, Wimbledon Threads, which breaks down the best spectator looks, has become a gateway into tennis for a Gen Z and Gen Alpha audience. She sees shifting perceptions of WAGs as a goal. “I've always embraced the WAG thing,” she tells me on a Zoom call. “I knew no matter what my feelings were on it, that's what I'd be called – so I never wanted to attach anything negative to it. Instead, I wanted to shift people's perspective on the word.” She compares the public's response to it to the divisive perception of influencers. “People immediately think 'urgh' and part of that is rooted in misogyny,” she says. “Fashion content creation is a female-led environment, so people criticise it. The same thing has happened in the WAG world, despite the fact that most WAGs are educated, run their own businesses and have good jobs. On top of that, these women also have the full-time job of supporting their partner. I'm not sure people understand and respect that.” Riddle has a way of talking about big achievements and ambitions with such lightness of touch. She might sound as peppy as a cheerleader, but she's self-aware, laser-focused and knows her self-worth. “People think of a WAG as someone who follows their partner around without having their own life,” she says. “Maybe they're financially dependant on them. I came in swinging, really making my own name in this space, and am trying to actively contribute to the sport. I don't just take glam pictures of myself. I know for a fact that I have brought a younger demographic to the game, and a younger, female-led audience too. I've made it more welcoming for female fans. Having a purpose for everything I'm doing is very important to me.” Tennis wasn't something Riddle grew up with; in fact, she knew very little about it. She was raised in Minnesota to a family of dairy farmers where the cooler weather meant that hockey was the sport of choice. Riddle thought she'd marry a farmer and would lead a bucolic life in the Mid-West until she watched the hit show Ugly Betty. The New York-based series was a siren call for her to move to the city, so she decided to study English at Wagner College on Staten Island. When she graduated, she moved into influencer marketing for Love Your Melon, which sold hats to raise money for paediatric cancer, and latterly for Gamers Outreach Foundation, a not-for-profit that brings video games to children's hospitals. During the pandemic in 2020, she was scrolling through the exclusive dating app Raya when she connected with Taylor Fritz. “In one of his pictures he was holding a koala and I just thought it was a really cute photo,” she recalls, laughing. “I mean, when you're swiping on dating apps it's not that deep.” She had no idea that he was a big shot in tennis. “In another of his pictures, he was playing tennis but I just thought, 'Oh cute, he must have played it at college or something.'” She knew pretty fast that he had staying power after she suggested watching the horror film Midsommar as a first-date activity, and he didn't balk despite hating the genre. The pandemic meant that Fritz was on a break from his usually intense tennis schedule, so the two enjoyed a quiet six-month period where they saw each other most days. “There was an instant connection,” she says. When Fritz did explain what was required of him outside of global pandemics in terms of training and travelling commitments, Riddle jumped at the chance to see more of the world. Her job at that time was remote, so she was able to work from wherever he was. She stresses that she doesn't just wait for her boyfriend in hotel rooms; when she's not watching the games, she's browsing museums, markets and trying out new restaurants. “I didn't travel very much growing up. We would go on spring break to South Dakota, but nowhere far-flung,” she says. ""So the idea of getting to travel the world and explore all these amazing places that the tennis tour brings us to was just amazing. I was and still am so game for it.”...","Five years ago, she knew nothing about tennis – today, she's become a star at her boyfriend's show More than two decades ago, the term 'WAG' exploded into pop-culture consciousness.

I wanted to look like I was supporting the Sixers, but I did not want to look like a walking American flag; I know I'm not alone in that trepidation. American history is marred by atrocities against Black people: Slavery, Jim Crow, lynching, centuries of systemic racism that has permeated everything from public education and the justice system to housing and healthcare. All of this has transpired, and much of it continues to, despite the fact that the United States as we know it would not exist without the contributions of Black people. I was born and raised here. I could not be more proud of my ancestors. I have lived a comfortable and privileged life in America. But given all the ways the country has mistreated and disenfranchised Black people, I've never been compelled to wear patriotism on my sleeve. That sentiment is especially strong today, as I find myself increasingly enraged by this country's current political and social landscape. This Fourth of July I will likely be in black; to me, it feels more like America's funeral than its birthday. My aversion to star-spangled fashion is such that in the rare instances when it actually resonates with me, I'm wholly taken aback. There is perhaps no better example of this than my reverence for Beyoncé's Cowboy Carter looks. When Beyoncé announced the release of Cowboy Carter in March of 2024, she did so with cover art that features the Houston native atop a white horse, holding an American flag, and wearing a custom red, white, and blue Busted Brand latex ensemble (fittingly inclusive of chaps), and white Paris Texas heeled boots. In an Instagram caption, she noted the criticism she faced while pursuing country music, and how she felt unwelcome in the genre's space—a space that wouldn't exist were it not for the contributions of Black artists. Sound familiar? As with nearly everything Beyoncé releases, the Cowboy Carter iconography became fodder for polarizing public discourse. In an opinion piece for The Guardian, Derecka Purnell wrote that the “pervasive idea that 'Black people built America' and are therefore entitled to its flag, pride, and positions of power can miss that much of what this country is and does is poisonous.” Janelle Hobson, who wrote about the visuals for Ms. and discussed them on NPR's Morning Edition podcast, ascertained that the imagery could have multiple meanings: Reclamation, yes, but also an acknowledgement of all the convictions and contradictions the American flag can stand for. Perhaps Beyoncé is “inviting us to wrest with the contentions between our different interpretations.” For Pop Sugar, my friend Jessican Andrews wrote that Beyoncé is “not embracing Americana fashion as propaganda or using it to seek white validation, [but] taking a nuanced approach. She's honoring her Black American cultural upbringing while acknowledging the ways American ideology has been exclusionary and problematic.” Beyoncé hasn't spoken publicly about her album cover art or the many red, white, and blue looks she's worn on the Cowboy Carter tour—and she and I aren't friends (yet)—so I can't say definitively why she has decided to lean so hard into the patriotic aesthetic. But as a fashion editor (and someone with exceptional vision) I can say that absolutely no one is wearing stars and stripes like she is. Painstakingly detailed, tailored to perfection, and rife with symbolism, the pieces that make up Beyoncé's current wardrobe will be remembered long after the tour concludes later this month. Since going on the road in April, Beyoncé has worn American flag Levi's chaps—the stars and stripes rendered in Swarovski crystals—and a shimmery USA-themed David Koma football jersey. Deftly styled by Shiona Turini, Bey donned a Coperni bodysuit with American flag bell bottoms to perform in L.A., and Burberry crystal-fringed American flag trousers in London. A red paisley bodysuit and draped overlay worn with distressed denim shorts came courtesy of Loewe, as did a checked-patterned shirt and skirt set in blue, paired with thigh-high white and red flame cowboy boots. Black designers have been integral to the Cowboy Carter story, with Beyoncé taking the stage in pieces by Telfar, Tongoro, Ib Kamara's Off-White, and Ferragamo by Maximilian Davis. Beyoncé's intentionality, Turini's talent, and a trove of custom pieces by renowned houses and emerging brands have made for an aspirational red, white, and blue wardrobe. That's no small feat for an aesthetic often embraced by groups with a narrow, exclusionary view of who can claim the American flag as their own. Fans show up to the Cowboy Carter tour in thoughtful, inventive takes on Western Americana fashion, stadiums filled with denim, bandanas, cowboy hats, and looks that don't just scream U.S.A but hoot and holler. When I went to the show in Houston, I carried a paisley-embossed NDG vanity bag (red), and wore a cropped HommeGirls tank (white) with denim 3x1 x Air Force 1 Nikes (blue). In the days since the concert, a number of friends, family, and colleagues have asked me about it—mostly inquiring about the set list and the car prop malfunction. What I inevitably discuss first, though, are the clothes. They're mesmerizing in their detail and design, but also worn with a sense of confidence and joy that, while understandably hard for many to relate to, echoes an optimism that will eventually overcome today's atrocities. I believe that this both sartorial and emotional spirit lives up to some semblance of what the American flag should represent. Well, one can only hope.","All products featured on Vogue are independently selected by our editors.

In an opinion piece for The Guardian, Derecka Purnell wrote that the “pervasive idea that 'Black people built America' and are therefore entitled to its flag, pride, and positions of power can miss that much of what this country is and does is poisonous.” Janelle Hobson, who wrote about the visuals for Ms. and discussed them on NPR's Morning Edition podcast, ascertained that the imagery could have multiple meanings: Reclamation, yes, but also an acknowledgement of all the convictions and contradictions the American flag can stand for. Perhaps Beyoncé is “inviting us to wrest with the contentions between our different interpretations.” For Pop Sugar, my friend Jessican Andrews wrote that Beyoncé is “not embracing Americana fashion as propaganda or using it to seek white validation, [but] taking a nuanced approach. She's honoring her Black American cultural upbringing while acknowledging the ways American ideology has been exclusionary and problematic.” Beyoncé hasn't spoken publicly about her album cover art or the many red, white, and blue looks she's worn on the Cowboy Carter tour—and she and I aren't friends (yet)—so I can't say definitively why she has decided to lean so hard into the patriotic aesthetic. But as a fashion editor (and someone with exceptional vision) I can say that absolutely no one is wearing stars and stripes like she is. Painstakingly detailed, tailored to perfection, and rife with symbolism, the pieces that make up Beyoncé's current wardrobe will be remembered long after the tour concludes later this month. Since going on the road in April, Beyoncé has worn American flag Levi's chaps—the stars and stripes rendered in Swarovski crystals—and a shimmery USA-themed David Koma football jersey. Deftly styled by Shiona Turini, Bey donned a Coperni bodysuit with American flag bell bottoms to perform in L.A., and Burberry crystal-fringed American flag trousers in London. A red paisley bodysuit and draped overlay worn with distressed denim shorts came courtesy of Loewe, as did a checked-patterned shirt and skirt set in blue, paired with thigh-high white and red flame cowboy boots. Black designers have been integral to the Cowboy Carter story, with Beyoncé taking the stage in pieces by Telfar, Tongoro, Ib Kamara's Off-White, and Ferragamo by Maximilian Davis. Beyoncé's intentionality, Turini's talent, and a trove of custom pieces by renowned houses and emerging brands have made for an aspirational red, white, and blue wardrobe. That's no small feat for an aesthetic often embraced by groups with a narrow, exclusionary view of who can claim the American flag as their own. Fans show up to the Cowboy Carter tour in thoughtful, inventive takes on Western Americana fashion, stadiums filled with denim, bandanas, cowboy hats, and looks that don't just scream U.S.A but hoot and holler. When I went to the show in Houston, I carried a paisley-embossed NDG vanity bag (red), and wore a cropped HommeGirls tank (white) with denim 3x1 x Air Force 1 Nikes (blue). In the days since the concert, a number of friends, family, and colleagues have asked me about it—mostly inquiring about the set list and the car prop malfunction. What I inevitably discuss first, though, are the clothes. They're mesmerizing in their detail and design, but also worn with a sense of confidence and joy that, while understandably hard for many to relate to, echoes an optimism that will eventually overcome today's atrocities. I believe that this both sartorial and emotional spirit lives up to some semblance of what the American flag should represent.

mov_35EB5128E5E2EDD3C1EB9E802E2A7F7F,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Poppy Delevingne has welcomed her first child with her partner Archie Keswick. The model, 39, and the billionaire businessman, 44, who went public with their relationship last June, shared their happy news to Instagram on Friday. Uploading a black and white snap clutching her baby girl's hand, Poppy penned: '20.05.25 The stars aligned, & then there was you.' Revealing her daughter's name, she continued: 'KAIA MOON KESWICK. Welcome to the world, baby bear. You have our hearts, our everything.' Poppy announced in January that she was expecting her first child, a baby girl, with her partner, Archie. The socialite said becoming a mother is 'all I've ever wanted,' as she shared the happy news with Elle magazine. Poppy first discovered she was pregnant during London Fashion Week when, during a fitting for a Burberry show, she noticed her clothes were tighter than usual. Sensing something was different, Poppy took a pregnancy test shortly after and then learned she was expecting a daughter. Speaking to ELLE UK in January, she said: 'Obviously, I would have been fine with either, and when I was younger, I always thought when I get pregnant, I wouldn't find out, but the second we got told we could find out, we did. I'm so excited. I come from all girls, we're very girl-heavy. Girls are great.' Poppy's sisters, model Cara, 32, and socialite Chloe, 39, were both delighted when she told them the news. She said: 'We were all in New York, with each other and with the bump, and there was a lot of talking to the bump, stroking the bump. They're just elated.' Poppy and Archie kept the news of her pregnancy to themselves for a while and only told friends and family around the four-month mark. The model previously admitted she was 'really nervous' about her pregnancy and wanted to 'protect' it for a while. She explained: 'It just feels like such an extraordinary privilege to be able to do this, to be able to have a baby at this age and at this time, and when it happened, I couldn't really believe it.' Poppy has long wanted to start a family of her own, but admitted in recent years she thought it might not happen for her and had 'made peace with it'. Poppy and Archie went public with their romance in July 2024, when they attended the BST Hyde Park festival together. Archie is the son of Simon Keswick, former director of multi-billion pound Hong Kong conglomerate Jardine Matheson - owner of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. The family has a private fortune of £6.35bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, and owns an 18,000-acre estate in Angus. Now the group's interests range from prime Hong Kong real estate and brands, including the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, to Vietnam's largest dairy producer. Archie was previously described as a 'demon on the tennis court' who 'loves house music' by Tatler. The Eton-educated businessman was named as one of the world's most eligible bachelors back in 2019. Archie is no stranger to a high-profile relationship. He previously dated actress Sienna Miller, 43, who once lived with Poppy during their New York days. He was linked to Sienna after reportedly being friends for years. The actress is now in a relationship with model Oli Green, 28, and they welcomed a daughter in December 2023. Poppy was previously married to James Cook. While neither addressed the break-up publicly, they are said to have called time on their union after eight years in 2022. Before finding love with Archie, Poppy was linked to Prince Constantine Alexios of Greece, 26, in April 2023.","Have YOU got a story?

mov_1C9393603063558DE8DB3D52B261DE71,"  Delay it as he has and request otherwise as he might, Cameron Norrie's time to take centre stage at Wimbledon has arrived. There was little attention on the 29-year-old heading into these Championships, the focus instead largely on Jack Draper and the assumption that he would lead the home charge over this fortnight. But Draper has succumbed to a early exit, as he did a year ago when losing to Norrie, and the thirst for British success must be quenched elsewhere. There will be no Burberry influencers in tow, the montages not quite as well-prepared, but Norrie finds himself in possession of the baton. He has made it clear he has little desire to grace Centre Court, preferring the setting and atmosphere of Court No1, and he looked at home once again in first battling and then cruising to a 7-6 6-4 6-2 win over Mattia Bellucci. There is only so long, however, that wishes can be granted. Norrie, a semi-finalist in 2022, is once again the last British man remaining in the singles draw and the spotlight cannot be avoided much longer. Nor, in all likelihood, the grandeur of Wimbledon's most hallowed ground, with a fourth-round clash to come against Joao Fonseca or Nicolas Jarry and beyond that, a potential quarter-final showdown with Carlos Alcaraz. “Every single big moment you got loud and changed the momentum, it was a big factor in the match,” Norrie said in his on-court interview afterwards. “I've got to thank you guys for that. “When I saw the schedule I was really happy. Hopefully I can play my next match on here, I don't know. Hopefully I can play all my matches on here.” Norrie's presence in the draw deep into the second week relies on that not being the case, but the sentiment is understandable. 12th seed Frances Tiafoe, beaten by Norrie in the second round, believed the support lifted the Briton to heights he would not otherwise have reached. It was Bellucci making the early noise here, though, with close to half of the Court No1 crowd still yet to return to their seats as the Italian made a flying start. He won the first seven points on Norrie's serve, which had been so much of a weapon against Tiafoe. Norrie's game is one not built on power or flair but rather grit and dogged determination. He just about avoided falling a double-break behind, scrambling out of trouble, before breaking to love in the following game to level it up at 4-4. They remained locked all the way through to 5-5 in the tie-break, when Norrie produced the match's best point at the biggest moment. The 24th and final shot of a bruising rally was a stunning backhand pass down the line, bringing up a set point that was duly converted. Bellucci was offering up an entertaining spectacle on his own, not shy in throwing everything at a huge forehand while also fighting a regular balance battle as he slid around, at times chaotically, behind the baseline. One awkward lunge early in the second set left him bent over, hand on knee, but Bellucci's mood was swiftly improved as a backhand winner recovered the break he had given up in the opening game. Norrie restored his advantage in familiar fashion, first hanging in and then taking charge of a another long rally to break for 4-3. The Briton has spoken of wanting an engaged crowd and he got just that, the good and the bad, as he served for the set. First the rallying cries when he fell 15-30 down, the murmurs of disappointment when a first serve crashed into the net, and the groans as a forehand flew long on set point. And then, minutes later, an almighty roar as an ace out wide sealed a two-set lead. Bellucci was at his most vulnerable when in control of a point, Norrie reading a smash and hammering a backhand winner down the line to secure a break early in the third. A break of serve and, seemingly, spirit. The Italian swiftly surrendered his serve again, this time to love, and that provided Norrie with ample breathing room. He was broken when serving for the match at 5-2, but completed the job in the following game. Now a nervous wait for Sunday's order of play.","Delay it as he has and request otherwise as he might, Cameron Norrie's time to take centre stage at Wimbledon has arrived.

mov_0269AFCF5A69D4DEE6DE250CE8EA8841,"  Delay it as he has and request otherwise as he might, Cameron Norrie's time to take centre stage at Wimbledon has arrived. There was little attention on the 29-year-old heading into these Championships, the focus instead largely on Jack Draper and the assumption that he would lead the home charge over this fortnight. But Draper has succumbed to a early exit, as he did a year ago when losing to Norrie, and the thirst for British success must be quenched elsewhere. There will be no Burberry influencers in tow, the montages not quite as well-prepared, but Norrie finds himself in possession of the baton. He has made it clear he has little desire to grace Centre Court, preferring the setting and atmosphere of Court No1, and he looked at home once again in first battling and then cruising to a 7-6 6-4 6-2 win over Mattia Bellucci. There is only so long, however, that wishes can be granted. Norrie, a semi-finalist in 2022, is once again the last British man remaining in the singles draw and the spotlight cannot be avoided much longer. Nor, in all likelihood, the grandeur of Wimbledon's most hallowed ground, with a fourth-round clash to come against Joao Fonseca or Nicolas Jarry and beyond that, a potential quarter-final showdown with Carlos Alcaraz. “Every single big moment you got loud and changed the momentum, it was a big factor in the match,” Norrie said in his on-court interview afterwards. “I've got to thank you guys for that. “When I saw the schedule I was really happy. Hopefully I can play my next match on here, I don't know. Hopefully I can play all my matches on here.” Norrie's presence in the draw deep into the second week relies on that not being the case, but the sentiment is understandable. 12th seed Frances Tiafoe, beaten by Norrie in the second round, believed the support lifted the Briton to heights he would not otherwise have reached. It was Bellucci making the early noise here, though, with close to half of the Court No1 crowd still yet to return to their seats as the Italian made a flying start. He won the first seven points on Norrie's serve, which had been so much of a weapon against Tiafoe. Norrie's game is one not built on power or flair but rather grit and dogged determination. He just about avoided falling a double-break behind, scrambling out of trouble, before breaking to love in the following game to level it up at 4-4. They remained locked all the way through to 5-5 in the tie-break, when Norrie produced the match's best point at the biggest moment. The 24th and final shot of a bruising rally was a stunning backhand pass down the line, bringing up a set point that was duly converted. Bellucci was offering up an entertaining spectacle on his own, not shy in throwing everything at a huge forehand while also fighting a regular balance battle as he slid around, at times chaotically, behind the baseline. One awkward lunge early in the second set left him bent over, hand on knee, but Bellucci's mood was swiftly improved as a backhand winner recovered the break he had given up in the opening game. Norrie restored his advantage in familiar fashion, first hanging in and then taking charge of a another long rally to break for 4-3. The Briton has spoken of wanting an engaged crowd and he got just that, the good and the bad, as he served for the set. First the rallying cries when he fell 15-30 down, the murmurs of disappointment when a first serve crashed into the net, and the groans as a forehand flew long on set point.

And if the tournament made them famous, it also transformed their lives off the pitch. From lucrative brand ambassadorships with high-end fashion labels such as Gucci to turns on the red carpet in dresses worthy of a Kardashian, England's female footballers now enjoy more than a touch of glitz and glamour. Once badly paid and barely recognised – who could forget goalie Mary Earps complaining before the last Euros that Nike hadn't even bothered to print replica shirts with her name on them – the nation's female footballers now have a soaring commercial appeal. So as they prepare to face France at 8pm tonight in their first game of this year's Euros – and inspire a new generation of young women with their sporting prowess – Molly Clayton reveals which of our Lionesses enjoys the most luxurious lifestyle. The Gucci model Shoots for Vogue, GQ and Elle Magazine. Modelling for Calvin Klein. Gucci snapping her up as a brand ambassador. Clearly, as well as being an impressive England captain, Leah Williamson, 28, has a catwalk-worthy fashion career too. One of the biggest earners off the pitch after leading the Lionesses to victory at the Euro 2022 final, the blonde beauty has a deal with Nike and has collaborated with global brands such as Aston Martin, Pepsi, Walkers and Mastercard. With 1.1 million Instagram followers, she has new advert partnerships with Weetabix and Cadbury, along with six children's books, titled The Wonder Team. With the deals comes the gloss: her recent lavish Mallorcan holiday to an Ikos resort would have set her back in the region of £1,000 a night. She is rumoured to be dating former model and Miss USA Elle Smith – both have posted about each other on social media. Ella the business brainbox With her ever-present fake eyelashes and love of make-up, Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone, 25, often showcases her beauty routine on her own YouTube channel. And with a canny business acumen to boot, Ella has already shaped an enviable off-pitch career. The first England women's player to trademark her name, she's set up her own brand, ET7, which includes a football academy for young girls. The name is inspired by her childhood hero, Portuguese footballing superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, whose own brand is called CR7. With some estimating her worth at more than £1 million, last month she set up her own creative agency, Amicizia, which aims to connect female athletes to commercial and marketing opportunities with top brands. Her sponsors include make-up company Charlotte Tilbury, orthodontic brand Invisalign and McDonald's, with her yearly earnings estimated as upwards of £200,000, fuelled by her popularity on social media. At one point, she was one of the top five most viewed athletes on TikTok. Ella has 737,000 Instagram followers and her own BBC podcast with best friend and fellow Lioness Alessia Russo, with whom she has appeared on the front cover of fashion and beauty magazine Elle. Ella loves nothing more than a red carpet bash. In a relationship with footballer Joe Bunney of Stalybridge Celtic FC, she regularly treats her fans to glimpses of their lavish holidays abroad and spa days at five-star hotels. Lauren's ooh la la lego Proving that every passion can be profitable, Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp, 24, has topped up her estimated £400,000 salary with a sponsorship deal with Lego. Devoted to creating Lego masterpieces in her downtime, saying it's 'the best way to relax', she's even made the Mona Lisa out of the bricks. Her other sponsors include Nike and Sports Direct. Lauren also has the support of her girlfriend, former Liverpool midfielder Ashley Hodson. Together for two years, the pair recently enjoyed a romantic trip to Paris, where Lauren saw the Mona Lisa in her more traditional setting. Shy superstar with an ex on the team Growing up, Lucy Bronze lived on Lindisfarne – also known as Holy Island – off the windswept coast of Northumberland. Her grandmother was caretaker of Lindisfarne Castle and today the outline of that building is tattooed on Lucy's wrist. Shy into adulthood, she was diagnosed with ADHD and autism in 2021. But neither her isolated upbringing nor her neurodiversity held her back. Rather, she's said she uses the intense focus associated with her conditions to her advantage – and now the 33-year-old is one of the biggest earners in the game. She reportedly took home £200,000 a year while playing at Barcelona before her move to Chelsea in 2024. Big money deals followed her triumph at the last Euros, with Pepsi, EE, Klarna and Visa among her backers. Her former girlfriend is fellow Lioness Keira Walsh. Fashion week regular She earned almost £2 million in 2023 alone, according to Forbes magazine. That same year, Alessia Russo's transfer from Manchester United to Arsenal made her one of the most expensive female footballers on the planet.

Hubungan yang secara historis retak antara Liam dan Noel Gallagher tidak hanya akan menghasilkan pertunjukan gemilang, namun emosional. Maka itu, menjangkau khalayak luas dan memanfaatkan gelombang nostalgia Britpop tahun 90-an untuk penjualan yang lebih tinggi seharusnya dilakukan para brand fesyen, menurut kolumnis Andrea Felsted, dikutip dari Bloomberg, Sabtu, 5 Juli 2025. Acara musik, terutama tur, selain perilisan album terkenal, seperti Cowboy Carter milik Beyonce dan Brat milik Charli XCX tahun lalu, telah jadi fenomena budaya. Levi Strauss & Co bekerja sama dengan Beyonce setelah lagunya ""Levii's Jeans,"" mengubah nama Instagram-nya sebentar menjadi ""Levii's"" dan meminta bintang tersebut untuk kampanye iklan. Banyak brand fesyen, termasuk Kate Spade milik Coach Inc., merangkul Brat. Sementara itu, desainer, termasuk Roberto Cavalli, Versace, dan Tiffany & Co. milik LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE mendandani Taylor Swift. Kini, para pengecer berbondong-bondong mengikuti apa yang disebut sebagai ""Wonderwall Summer.""  Merek mewah asal Inggris Burberry Group Plc jadi yang terdepan. Meski tidak secara eksplisit terkait dengan tur tersebut, kampanye Burberry Festival menampilkan Liam Gallagher dan kedua putranya, Lennon dan Gene Gallagher, serta putrinya Molly Moorish-Gallagher. Dorongan pemasaran ini mengingatkan publik pada masa kejayaan Burberry di tahun 1990-an. Kampanye terbaru memang menampilkan musisi Goldie, serta para pesohor perempuan: Cara Delevingne dan Alexa Chung, tapi Liam adalah bintang utamanya. Ia mengenakan parka Burberry miliknya sendiri dari tahun 2018, yang akan diterbitkan ulang dalam edisi terbatas. Adidas AG lebih terbuka dalam menarik penggemar Oasis, dengan memproduksi koleksi dari co-branded clothing, yang dijual secara daring dan di toko-toko Adidas, serta Oasisinet.com, situs resminya, dan di stadion selama tur. Di antara nama-nama lain yang terlibat adalah Levi's, yang membuat serangkaian kaus oblong, dan Stone Island milik Moncler SpA, yang menampilkan Liam dalam kampanye musim gugurnya. Band rock pria, kata Felsted, berarti audiensnya beragam, yang berguna untuk penjualan pakaian pria dan wanita. Menurut GlobalData, pasar pakaian dan alas kaki pria sekitar dua pertiga dari ukuran pakaian wanita, menjadikannya peluang yang signifikan. Meski ketertarikan yang terus berlanjut terhadap segala hal yang berbau tahun 90-an telah memperkenalkan Oasis pada generasi baru, hampir setengah dari mereka yang hadir telah menyaksikan konser band tersebut sebelumnya, menurut laporan Belanja Konsumen Barclays Plc. Mengingat bahwa Gallagher bersaudara belum pernah tampil bersama sejak 2009, hal itu menyiratkan demografi yang lebih tua, yang sering kali berarti kelompok yang memiliki uang untuk dibelanjakan pada kegiatan rekreasi.  Ini juga membantu bahwa banyak gaya yang dikenakan band tersebut. Di antaranya adalah elana jins longgar, kaus sepak bola, dan sepatu kets low-rise yang kembali jadi tren berkat apa yang disebut estetika ""Blokecore."" Sementara Swifties mungkin telah memilih payet dan Beyhive dengan topi koboi, penggemar Oasis tampaknya berfoya-foya dengan parka dan topi bucket.  Meski panasnya musim panas, rata-rata unggahan  TikTok mingguan yang menampilkan parka naik 188 persen antara 1 Juni dan 1 Juli, dibandingkan dengan bulan sebelumnya, menurut perusahaan intelijen pasar Trendalytics. Pencarian parka di pasar barang bekas Depop naik 1.850 persen pada Juni 2025, dibandingkan dengan periode tahun sebelumnya. Topi bucket juga punya daya tarik tersendiri. Menurut penelitian Barclays, hampir sepertiga penggemar yang menghadiri konser berencana mengenakan busana bergaya tahun 90-an, dan untuk mendorong perusahaan yang bekerja sama, lebih dari seperlima berencana mengenakan co-branded item. Pembelian tersebut akan menyumbang 1,06 miliar pound sterling (sekitar Rp23,4 trilioun) yang diharapkan akan dibelanjakan penggemar Oasis Inggris secara keseluruhan, menurut Barclays. Angka ini mencakup tiket, akomodasi, serta biaya makanan dan minuman. Oasis sendiri tidak selalu memiliki hubungan yang mudah dengan dunia mode.

With gloomy news headlines, rising government debt, and speculation that the Labour Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will be increasing taxes to recoup the overspend and government borrowing, many businesses are already scrutinising every line of their expenditure. The natural instinct in times of belt-tightening is often to wield the axe, and regrettably, marketing budgets are frequently the first to face the chop. But here's a crucial warning: reducing your brand's marketing exposure should not be one of the cuts you make. In fact, it could be the most counterproductive move. Why Your Brand's Awareness is Non-Negotiable When economic headwinds blow, protecting your brand and its awareness amongst your current and potential audience becomes more, not less, vital. Diminishing your visibility risks: • Losing Market Share: Competitors who maintain or even increase their presence will steal your audience. • Eroding Brand Equity: Long-term brand building takes consistent effort. A sudden absence can quickly lead to forgetfulness. • Impacting Future Growth: Even if sales slow now, you need to be top-of-mind when the market picks up. Cutting marketing is a false economy that can inflict long-term damage far greater than any short-term savings. The key isn't to cut, but to optimise.

De qué manera están cambiando los agentes de IA la vida cotidiana Al igual que tener un sitio web era sinónimo de modernidad hace 30 años, integrar agentes de IA se convierte hoy en un nuevo estándar para muchas empresas y usuarios. En menos de un año, asistentes virtuales empezaron a gestionar agendas, redactar documentos, responder consultas y ofrecer soluciones altamente personalizadas. Este auge responde, en parte, a la demanda de usuarios cada vez más exigentes que valoran la velocidad y la capacidad de producción. Según la consultora Gartner, los agentes de IA ya representan al menos el 15% de las decisiones laborales en diversos sectores. A diferencia de los sistemas tradicionales, no solo contestan preguntas, sino que aprenden e interpretan comportamientos, incorporan información y optimizan sus resultados. Pomies remarca: “El cambio exponencial es que no se limitan a responder, sino que analizan, ajustan, mejoran con el tiempo y ofrecen respuestas personalizadas. Definitivamente, el nuevo avance será una reconfiguración absoluta”. Qué sectores económicos lideran la adopción de agentes de inteligencia artificial Los sectores que mejor adaptan estas soluciones van desde el comercio minorista y los servicios financieros hasta la industria del entretenimiento. Según Pomies, los agentes de IA se consolidan como “socios estratégicos” integrados en los circuitos fundamentales de la economía digital. En la experiencia de compra, Burberry incorporó espejos interactivos y herramientas de realidad aumentada en sus tiendas. Estas tecnologías permiten a los clientes probar prendas virtualmente y recibir sugerencias instantáneas de artículos compatibles. Empresas como Ray-Ban y Amazon experimentan con desarrollos basados en IA para optimizar la toma de decisiones del consumidor.

Cómo impacta en la eficiencia y la producción los agentes de IA El crecimiento de los agentes de IA transformó los procesos internos de compañías de todo el mundo. Un banco líder automatizó la conversación de su servicio de programación y redujo en 80% su tiempo de modernización. Una tarea que tradicionalmente demandaba 560 horas se completó en apenas 105.

Tras la pandemia de COVID-19, el 85% de las industrias intentaron implementar soluciones digitales, aunque el 75% no obtuvo los resultados esperados por falta de madurez digital, según la consultora Boston Consulting Group. La actualización permanente de los sistemas y la capacitación continua aparecen como condiciones necesarias para aprovechar el potencial de los agentes inteligentes. Cuáles son los riesgos y obstáculos que acompañan este avance El ritmo acelerado de la adopción tecnológica exige a las empresas y a la sociedad anticiparse a los cambios, aunque las barreras no son menores. La curva de aprendizaje, la escasez de talento experimentado en IA y la necesidad de establecer marcos normativos y éticos adecuados presentan desafíos urgentes. Además, la transformación digital sigue incompleta en muchos sectores, lo que dificulta que las innovaciones tecnológicas se traduzcan en beneficios reales y sostenidos. Pomies subraya: “Durante tantos años se ha hablado de transformación digital, pero todavía el nuevo escenario con los agentes de IA está asomando. Aún parece lejos, pero si algo hemos visto en la evolución de internet desde Tim Berners-Lee hasta la fecha, es que todo sucede muy rápido y anticiparse suele ser la clave del éxito”.","SPR_COMBO[es]ChatGPT y Gemini fueron incorporadas de forma rápida en la rutina personal y profesional de millones de personas, pero la IA va más allá de dar respuestas a preguntas, su impacto permite mejorar el rendimiento de cualquier empresa A finales de los 80, la invención de la World Wide Web por Tim Berners-Lee marcó el inicio de una era que transformó la vida y el trabajo a nivel mundial. Más de tres décadas después, el impacto de los agentes de inteligencia artificial (IA) se perfila como un fenómeno de alcance comparable. Según especialistas de Globant, la irrupción de estos sistemas inteligentes genera un cambio profundo en las costumbres, tanto en personas como en empresas, y anticipa una nueva etapa, tan disruptiva como lo fue la llegada masiva de internet en los años noventa.

mov_E12C1B7A07A064AB815888D887139361,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com New mum Poppy Delevingne was seen for the first time since giving birth on Sunday as she headed to Wimbledon day seven with her father Charles. The model, 39, and her billionaire businessman partner Archie Keswick, 44, who went public with their relationship last June, shared the happy news to Instagram on Friday that they had welcomed a baby girl back in May. And she looked happy and healthy as she arrived for the sporting event in a flared white jumpsuit which she wore with a beige jacket. She accessorised with dark shades and wore her blonde tresses in loose waves as she posed with her father who wore a dapper navy suit. Meanwhile Andrew Garfield, 41, and his rumoured girlfriend Monica Barbaro arrived hand in hand to the All England Tennis and Croquet Club. The American actress, 35, showed off her incredible figure in a strappy white top as they appeared to confirm their romance - after first sparking relationship rumours in February this year. Andrew looked smart as he matched her in white and had a knitted jumper slung over his shoulders. It comes after last weekend the pair reportedly packed on the PDA at Glastonbury Festival. Poppy announced she had welcomed her first child with her partner Archie on Friday. She shared their happy news to Instagram. Uploading a black and white snap clutching her baby girl's hand, Poppy penned: '20.05.25 The stars aligned, & then there was you.' Revealing her daughter's name, she continued: 'KAIA MOON KESWICK. Welcome to the world, baby bear. You have our hearts, our everything.' Poppy announced in January that she was expecting her first child, a baby girl, with her partner, Archie. The socialite said becoming a mother is 'all I've ever wanted,' as she shared the happy news with Elle magazine. Poppy first discovered she was pregnant during London Fashion Week when, during a fitting for a Burberry show, she noticed her clothes were tighter than usual. Sensing something was different, Poppy took a pregnancy test shortly after and then learned she was expecting a daughter. Speaking to ELLE UK in January, she said: 'Obviously, I would have been fine with either, and when I was younger, I always thought when I get pregnant, I wouldn't find out, but the second we got told we could find out, we did. I'm so excited. I come from all girls, we're very girl-heavy. Girls are great.' Poppy's sisters, model Cara, 32, and socialite Chloe, 39, were both delighted when she told them the news. She said: 'We were all in New York, with each other and with the bump, and there was a lot of talking to the bump, stroking the bump. They're just elated.' Poppy and Archie kept the news of her pregnancy to themselves for a while and only told friends and family around the four-month mark. The model previously admitted she was 'really nervous' about her pregnancy and wanted to 'protect' it for a while. She explained: 'It just feels like such an extraordinary privilege to be able to do this, to be able to have a baby at this age and at this time, and when it happened, I couldn't really believe it.' Poppy has long wanted to start a family of her own, but admitted in recent years she thought it might not happen for her and had 'made peace with it'. Poppy and Archie went public with their romance in July 2024, when they attended the BST Hyde Park festival together. Archie is the son of Simon Keswick, former director of multi-billion pound Hong Kong conglomerate Jardine Matheson - owner of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. The family has a private fortune of £6.35bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, and owns an 18,000-acre estate in Angus. Now the group's interests range from prime Hong Kong real estate and brands, including the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, to Vietnam's largest dairy producer. Archie was previously described as a 'demon on the tennis court' who 'loves house music' by Tatler. The Eton-educated businessman was named as one of the world's most eligible bachelors back in 2019. Archie is no stranger to a high-profile relationship. He previously dated actress Sienna Miller, 43, who once lived with Poppy during their New York days. He was linked to Sienna after reportedly being friends for years. The actress is now in a relationship with model Oli Green, 28, and they welcomed a daughter in December 2023. Poppy was previously married to James Cook. While neither addressed the break-up publicly, they are said to have called time on their union after eight years in 2022. Before finding love with Archie, Poppy was linked to Prince Constantine Alexios of Greece, 26, in April 2023.","Have YOU got a story?

Poppy and Archie kept the news of her pregnancy to themselves for a while and only told friends and family around the four-month mark. The model previously admitted she was 'really nervous' about her pregnancy and wanted to 'protect' it for a while. She explained: 'It just feels like such an extraordinary privilege to be able to do this, to be able to have a baby at this age and at this time, and when it happened, I couldn't really believe it.' Poppy has long wanted to start a family of her own, but admitted in recent years she thought it might not happen for her and had 'made peace with it'.

Anfang Juni berichtete WWD, dass Coty erwägt, seine Verbraucher- und Prestige-Divisionen zu veräußern, darunter einige der bekanntesten Marken von Beauty wie Covergirl sowie Chloé- und Hugo-Chef-Parfums. Die Ankündigung versetzte den Aktienkurs von Coty 13 Prozent auf 5 USD; Die Veräußerung beider Waffen würde im Wesentlichen mehr als 120 Jahre als Unternehmen beendet. Coty lehnte es ab, sich zu dem Bericht zu äußern. Trotz seiner Größe und Stall bekannter Namen hat das amerikanische Konglomerat in den letzten Jahren Schwierigkeiten, mit seinen Konkurrenten Schritt zu halten. Innerhalb des Portfolios seines größten Anteilseigners Jab Holdings ist Coty das schlechteste Kapital und senkt den Ausblick im letzten Geschäftsjahr, wobei weitere Umsatzrückgänge projiziert werden. Coty hat versucht, sein Ansehen zu verbessern. Seit seinem derzeitigen CEO Sue Nabi im Jahr 2020 eintraf, hat das Unternehmen das Fett getrimmt und nicht-Kernmarken wie Professional Lines Wella und OPI abgebrochen.

Dies sind wünschenswerte Vermögenswerte, selbst mit intensiver Konkurrenz durch Inseln auf dem Weg. Diese Düfte des Modehaus sind weit verbreitet, bekannt und haben ein integriertes Prestige und Dynamik.

Read our privacy notice. First there was “Gareth Southgate” Tube station. Then Bond Street station was renamed “Burberry Street” and Old Street became “Fold Street”. Now Transport for London is looking to generate millions with a major gear change in how it cashes in on the Tube's world-famous brand – by offering businesses the chance to sponsor an entire line. TfL has begun promoting the opportunity to become the “first-ever sponsor of the Waterloo & City line”, the two-stop, three-minute shuttle service that links Waterloo and Bank stations. It has placed an advert on its LinkedIn page offering an “exclusive” deal that “goes far beyond a typical media opportunity”. TfL said: “It's full-line branding, from moquette seat fabric and signage to maps and experiential spaces, all right in the heart of London's business district. “Millions of professionals and decision-makers travel this route every year. Now, your brand can own the journey.” Nicknamed “The Drain” and traditionally used by commuters heading into the Square Mile after arriving by train at Waterloo, the Waterloo & City is the shortest of the 11 lines on the London Underground and is only open on weekdays. Southgate station, at the northern end of the Piccadilly line, was temporarily renamed “Gareth Southgate” Tube station by Visa in honour of the then England manager after the national team reached the semi-final of the 2018 World Cup. The two-day “takeover” of Southgate station generated £80,000 for TfL and included branded roundels, themed Tannoy announcements, digital screen messages and flash mobs. Bond Street was briefly renamed “Burberry Street” by the fashion brand to mark London Fashion Week in October 2023. However this led to 57 complaints to TfL, relating mainly to concerns about passengers becoming confused by the mock Tube signs. Last year, Old Street became “Fold Street” to promote Samsung's “Fold and Flip” smartphones, generating £250,000 for TfL. At the time, Transport For All, which represents passengers with disabilities, raised concerns about the Tube becoming a “wild-west PR playground”. One of the most lucrative Tube branding deals was the £830,000 TfL received from Galaxy when it allowed the Circle line to feature in a “reimagined” version of Harry Beck's classic Tube map in January 2024. But the five-year IFS Cloud sponsorship of the cable car – which crosses the Thames between the Royal Docks and North Greenwich – may be the best baseline indicator of the kind of deal TfL will be hoping to secure in return for allowing a firm to add its name as a prefix to the Waterloo & City line. The cable car sponsorship is worth £2.1m – but the Waterloo & City line boasts tens of thousands of commuters each day as a “ captive audience” - rather than day-trippers and foreign tourists. The Waterloo & City line first opened in 1898 and was only the second electric line on the Underground. Passenger access to the platforms at Bank station – originally known as City - was by a lengthy sloping subway, which is believed to have led to the nickname The Drain. The walkway was upgraded to have moving walkways in 1960. The 48-hour rebranding of the Circle line was done by Samsung to promote its S24 Ultra phone. There were advertising displays at Victoria, Blackfriars, Liverpool Street, Paddington and Westminster stations and “a complete domination of Kings Cross St Pancras”. TfL said the campaign was “hugely popular, receiving rave reviews and has been nominated for numerous awards”. Amazon Prime paid TfL £250,000 in 2020 to rebrand Piccadilly Circus station as Picardilly Circus for 48 hours to promote the Star Trek spin-off series, Picard. The station name was changed to Picardilly on all line maps and platform roundels to create an “immersive experience” for passengers. There were also themed Tannoy announcements in the voice of Captain Jean Luc Picard and an advertising domination throughout the station. The promotion was widely covered by the news media and even featured on The Graham Norton Show. It also won the 'Most Spectacular' award at the Drum Out of Home Awards.

A few years later, during London Fashion Week in October 2023, Bond Street was briefly renamed “Burberry Street”. The name change led to 57 complaints to TfL as passengers complained about becoming confused by the mock Tube signs. Complaints were also made last year when Samsung renamed Old Street to “Fold Street” to promote their new “Fold and Flip” smartphone, generating £250,000 for TfL.

The sponsorship included branded roundels, themed Tannoy announcements, digital screen messages and flash mobs. A few years later, during London Fashion Week in October 2023, Bond Street was briefly renamed “Burberry Street”. The name change led to 57 complaints to TfL as passengers complained about becoming confused by the mock Tube signs. Complaints were also made last year when Samsung renamed Old Street to “Fold Street” to promote their new “Fold and Flip” smartphone, generating £250,000 for TfL. The only time that a public transport line in London has been completely sponsored is the £2.1 million five-year IFS Cloud sponsorship of the cable car, which crosses the Thames between the Royal Docks and North Greenwich.

Listen to the best of BBC Radio London on Sounds and follow BBC London on , and Related internet links","Transport for London (TfL) is offering a new partnership to a company willing to pay to sponsor the Waterloo & City line. The line – which runs on weekdays between Bank and Waterloo Underground stations – was opened in July 1898 and is colloquially known as The Drain. A TfL spokesperson said: ""No line or stations will be renamed, but brands will have the chance to further incorporate their brand identity on platforms and in the train carriages, including on the seat moquette."" The line only runs on weekdays between Bank and Waterloo [] The two-stop, three-minute shuttle service is one of only two Tube lines that runs completely underground, the other being the Victoria line. TfL said: ""It's full-line branding, from moquette seat fabric and signage to maps and experiential spaces, all right in the heart of London's business district."" Moquette fabric is the durable, woollen seating material that is used in upholstery on Tube carriage seats, while an experiential space is described by TfL as a ""pop-up presence for sampling and distribution in a pre-approved station space"". TfL said: ""Millions of professionals and decision-makers travel this route every year. Now, your brand can own the journey.""

The Britannic Explorer, operated by Belmond, the LVMH-owned hospitality brand behind some of the world's most iconic trains and hotels, now turns its attention to the heart of Britain. From the end of the month, travellers will be able to enjoy an unforgettable experience that will take them through the heart of the British countryside in pure, slow-travel style. The brand behind the legendary Venice Simplon-Orient-Express and the much-loved sleeper through the Scottish Highlands has spared neither coin nor corner to create an experience as indulgent as it is memorable: a journey designed to make travellers feel no less privileged than had they boarded the now-decommissioned Royal Train. © Belmond If you want to truly pamper yourself while watching Cornwall's cliffs, Welsh valleys, and Lake District hills roll by, this is for you. Provided, of course, you have pockets deep enough. With journeys starting at £11,000 (€13,000), the three-night experience includes not just your cabin, but all meals, excursions, wine, and other beverages. Departing from London to three key regions, the journey includes curated off-board excursions such as coastal sailing and yoga by the sea, wild swimming, lavender farm visits, wood-fired saunas in Wales, and even a night at Belmond's Cadogan Hotel in London. Gary Franklin, Belmond's VP of Trains and Cruises, calls it a truly unique experience, 'an opportunity to discover the rugged Cornish coastline, Snowdonia's untamed National Park and the vast expanses of the Lake District like never before'. And if stepping off the train sounds optional, that's because the onboard world is an experience in itself. The Britannic Explorer features three Grand Suites and fifteen Double Suites, along with a spa, a cocktail bar, and a dining experience led by Michelin-starred chef Simon Rogan, known for his farm-to-fork ethos and reverence for seasonal British ingredients. His menus change with the landscape, drawing inspiration from the regions the train passes through. © Belmond 'I hope every passenger not only enjoys the flavours but also feels a connection between the dishes and the journey,' Rogan said. ' Each plate will reflect Britain's diverse landscapes.' But it's not just your taste buds that will be pampered. The interiors, classic in tone, conjure an atmosphere that feels like a full Burberry meets Laura Ashley meets Ashley Hicks – or in other words, the very best of British elegance, comfort, and quirk. Designed by London-based studio Albion Nord, the train brings together some of the UK's most distinctive contemporary artisans. © Belmond Designers such as Luke Edward Hall, Mel Campion, and Olly Fathers have each added their touch: whimsical wallpaper reinterpreting botanical patterns and travel motifs; shell-adorned mirrors in the powder rooms; bold contemporary panels in the Grand Suites. Wool, velvet, wood, brass, and stone are used to echo the natural landscapes rolling past the windows. It's a space that feels rich yet relaxed, familiar yet rare. © Belmond There's movement and mood woven into every corner.

Waterloo station (c) ianVisits Although TfL has often offered station takeover campaigns where an advertiser can effectively buy up all the advertising spaces in the station, this would be a far larger rebranding effort. In a posting on LinkedIn, TfL announced that it is offering an initial opportunity to be the exclusive sponsor of the Waterloo and City line. They say that “this goes far beyond a typical media opportunity. It's full-line branding, from moquette seat fabric and signage to maps and experiential spaces, all right in the heart of London's business district” This would be far more than a station takeover, as it would include the trains as well as the stations. The Waterloo and City line has likely been chosen to pilot the scheme, partially because it's a smaller line, but also because it offers a complete brand takeover for the entire journey from station to station. A TfL spokesperson said: “This new opportunity on the Waterloo & City line is part of our ongoing work to find new ways brands can use our network to engage with their audiences as they travel across the city. No line or stations will be renamed, but brands will have the chance to further incorporate their brand identity on platforms and in the train carriages, including on the seat moquette. “All revenue generated through any brand partnerships with us will be invested into the wider transport network, helping to keep London moving.” Whatever the end result, it will likely be controversial. Previous branding efforts have been controversial, none more so than the renaming of Bond Street tube station as Burberry Street station, which was accused of confusing passengers. That was a major wayfinding signage change, whereas most station branding campaigns tend to be more subtle. For example, the recent Playstation ad campaign on the Victoria line didn't seem to annoy people as it was subtle and also played into the London Underground branding. Then again, imagine riding the Yellow Pages train, where an entire tube train was turned bright yellow inside and out. Done well, advertising can even be popular. Yes, really. The swiftly announced renaming of (Gareth) Southgate tube station in 2018 saw people travelling to the station specifically to take a photo, and Picardilly Circus station for Star Trek was likewise popular.

While the other three men in the newest post were not identified, in an earlier Instagram Story chronicling a similar jam sesh, Bieber tagged several other musicians and friends, including singer-songwriter Jensen McRae, pastor Judah Smith, Josh Mehl, DJ Taylor James and producer Camper. The singer has kept a relatively low public profile over the past year since revealing that he was struggling with Ramsay Hunt syndrome, which caused him partial facial paralysis and resulted in him canceling all this tour dates in 2022. In addition to some emotional recent posts in which he told fans he felt like he was “drowning” in “hate” and struggling with feeling “unworthy,” Bieber recently fessed up to being “broken” and having “anger issues.” Over the weekend, Bieber shared a series of pictures with Hailey in which he was seen smiling and hugging her at sunset with the caption, “My forever n always [heart emoji].” That update was accompanied by another series, this time close-ups of the singer's sweaty face shrouded under a towel with the caption: “Detoxxxxxxxxxxx.” He also shared yet another studio snap over the weekend, this one featuring a black and white image of rapper Lil B and skater/stylist Burberry Erry.

Inspired by the simplicity of nature and Chanel's 31 rue Cambon ateliers, the line was the last created by the label's in-house team before new creative director Matthieu Blazy's first runway debuts in October. Tweed skirt suits, separates, and dresses were crafted in smooth knits and soft mohair, cast in tonal shades of deep gold, cream, plum, black, and dark green. Added levity came from multicolored flowers, seen in embroidery on dresses and coats. Wheat ears—which Gabrielle Chanel saw as a symbol of abundance—were prominent throughout the collection, embroidered across dresses, embossed on sparkling buttons, and clutched in a golden bouquet held by the show's finale bride. A star-studded crowd was in attendance for the occasion as well, including Lorde, Gracie Abrams, Keira Knightley, Naomi Campbell, Laufey, Kirsten Dunst, Sofia Coppola, Romy Mars, Cosima Mars, Marion Cotillard, and more. All images: Courtesy of Chanel Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, and Neiman Marcus Face Dropping Summer Sales It's shaping up to be a challenging sales year for luxury brands—including Saks Fifth Avenue. The retailer, which merged earlier this year with Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman in a $2.7 billion deal, has faced a sales drop of 28% compared to 2024, according to The Business of Fashion. Alongside Saks, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf's sales also dropped 26% each compared to last year. The shift follows Saks Global's release of its financial performance in May, where the combined revenue of Saks, Neiman's, and Bergdorf's dropped 10% to $7.3 billion. The group's low sales also follow the luxury slowdown of 2024 that's continued into 2025, with decreasing sales affecting brands including Chanel, Hermès, Gucci, Burberry, and more.

While speaking with writer Charlie Kolbrener in his accompanying feature profile, Role Model chats about the rerelease of his album Kansas Anymore, new role in Lena Dunham's upcoming Netflix film Good Sex, and friendship with fellow star Gracie Abrams—who he's also touring with this year. “She was one of the first people I met and hung around with when I first moved to LA, and was just very welcoming,” Pillsbury said. “She was about to put out her first EP Minor. I feel like I've had the privilege of watching her from that very beginning moment to now doing massive arena shows around the world and exploding, rightfully so. It's cool now, I get to watch it side stage. It's a very full circle moment for me personally.

The policy, which has existed at U.S. airports from the Transportation Security Administration since 2006, is being phased out this year, according to People. Some airports have already let passengers keep their shoes on while checking in, including Baltimore/Washington International Airport, Portland International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, Fort Lauderdale International Airport, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, and Piedmont Triad International Airport. As of Monday, the New York City's LaGuardia Airport and Los Angeles International Airport have also apparently begun implanting the new policy as well.

Here's a quick look at the openings that stood out in 2025 so far, plus a heads up: our monthly Where We're Eating & Drinking column is coming back, too. Spanish food: Atica, Ocean's Table - both have spanish menus with different angles of spanish food and completely different styles. Bars: Nora's Wine Shop & Bar, Penicillin - new spots for wine and cocktails that show two different sides of Shanghai nightlife. Pop ups: Nono's - a fun concept that opened in April and is back with a test kitchen at different F&B spots around the city. Special mentions: A few new fine dining places, a Japanese omakase, new places in the PAC, and some luxury label cafés. ática This will be Bottega group's fourth restaurant in Shanghai and third restaurant off of Xiangyang. Ática is a Spanish tapas restaurant from the Bottega and Forno team (Beijing), on the rooftop terrace of the Basement FG mansion just off Xiangyang Park (Xiangyang Bei Lu and Xinle Lu). The menu, made by Ferran Edo Andreu (also of Ocean's Table), has traditional Spanish tapas with dishes like olive and anchovy skewers with pickled Navarra piparra (58rmb), confit piquillo peppers with toasted peanuts (38rmb), and three kinds of patatas (48–58rmb). There's even flan (48rmb). The patio was built for long afternoons and summer nights: a full gin & tonic menu (16), eight types of sangria, and classic cocktails. DJs every weekend, and live flamenco on most. Atica seems like its designed to feel familiar to anyone who's spent time in Spain. Expect a wait or book ahead. penicillin Hong Kong's Penicillin (ranked #24 on Asia's 50 Best Bars), now has a Shanghai outpost. It's not here to serve your usual gin and tonic or whiskey sour. Opened in April, this is the spot for drinkers who want to be surprised. Expect cocktails with ingredients like fermented rice water, grilled red cabbage soda, or rotovap waste shell vodka. Drinks are split into fermented cocktails (88rmb), mocktails (75rmb), with 15 cocktails (90rmb), some exclusive to the Shanghai menu. The space is photo-friendly: glass-top tables with succulents, a tree in the center of the entryway, and a frozen (or heated) bar panel depending on the season. There's also a VIP room with no minimum spend. As the founders Agung Prabowo and Laura (originally from Indonesia) say, ""Everyone is VIP."" Sustainability is core to Penicillin: no coasters, plenty of ingredient upcycling, and a tree planted in Indonesia for every drink sold. Come curious, leave buzzed. Ocean's Table Ocean's Table opened in early June in the old Commune Social space. While its predecessor was modern fusion, Ocean's Table leans more contemporary Spanish. The interior still feels familiar: a sleek, two-story layout with the wraparound open kitchen bar and — thankfully — that leafy garden patio intact. Spanish chef Ferran Edo Andreu leads with a seafood-forward lineup, plus wagyu and vegetarian plates. Brunch runs Friday to Sunday, 11am–2pm, with set menus (268–398rmb) that include coffee and optional sangria. Dinner is à la carte, tapas-style, with mains topping out at 288rmb. Cocktails are between 58–98rmb, with a full wine list for when things go long. The upstairs bar seats about eight and leads to a small rooftop where you can take your drink and unwind. With its flexible layout, Ocean's Table works for a date, a group dinner, or solo time at the bar with a plate of croquettes and a glass of sangria. Bizy Boy Don't let the sandwich fame fool you: Bizy Boy is running a full, chef-driven menu. They opened in March and quickly made waves online for the above-mentioned, lunch-time only, pastrami sandwich. Chef Jeremy's menu includes house-made pastas like scallop mousse ravioli with black tiger prawn (128rmb), and rigatoni with scallop, spicy tomato, and vodka sauce (138rmb). You'll also find beetroot-apple soda (35rmb) and marinated mushrooms with burrata (98rmb). The food might read upscale, but the space keeps things casual and fun. Colorful interiors, collabs with brands like Bloom Coffee, and events like their recent block party with Franklin (Next Bottle, Nono's), where they turned the pastrami sandwich into a taco, makes this place more like a neighborhood restaurant.

Arnold Jerocki/Save this storySaveSave this storySave In April, Emma Watson turned 35 years old. She also celebrated more than five years away from the movies: the last time we saw her on the big screen was in Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Little Women, released back in 2019. Though Watson has been largely away from the spotlight since then, she has kept busy. Watson started an MA in creative writing at Oxford University in 2023; according to the Daily Mail, university life captivates her so much that she also started a PhD program this year. Perhaps Watson is making up for lost time. When she finished secondary school, she was unable to immediately enter university because she was committed to filming the last two installments of the Harry Potter saga. She took a gap year, then enrolled at Brown University to study English literature. Watson graduated in five years instead of four because she had to take two whole semesters off to film projects like My Week with Marilyn, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Bling Ring, This Is the End, and Noah. This time around, she has taken a complete hiatus from her film career so that it does not interfere with her education. But this is not the only reason she has stepped away from the movies. “I think I felt a bit caged,” Watson told the Financial Times in the spring of 2023, shortly before starting her master's degree. “The thing I found really hard was that I had to go out and sell something that I really didn't have very much control over. To stand in front of a film and have every journalist be able to say, 'How does this align with your viewpoint?' It was very difficult to have to be the face and the spokesperson for things where I didn't get to be involved in the process.” A few months later, in December 2023, she admitted to the British edition of Vogue that she was grateful for the respite she had taken. “I'm just so glad that I did [step away from acting] because I have this feeling of having my own voice and creative space and sovereignty in some way that I don't think I did before – more autonomy,” she said. “I'm so glad that I allowed things to be messy for a minute and to really allow myself to not know [what's next], because the knowing that I've come to, I wouldn't trade that for anything.” Watson used that creative space, to make her directorial debut in 2022 with a short film for Prada Beauty's Paradoxe fragrance campaign; she also wrote the script and acted in it. In 2024, Watson became the face of Prada's Re-Nylon collection, made solely from nylon taken from the recycling and purification of plastic collected from the sea. Emma Watson has been committed to sustainable fashion since she was a teenager. In 2009 she was already linked as a creative advisor to People Tree, one of the pioneers of ethical fashion. In 2020 she joined the board of directors of People Tree. That same year, she also joined the board of directors of Kering, the luxury conglomerate that encompasses firms such as Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, to lead its sustainability committee. Watson was its youngest member at the time. She left the position in 2023, when she returned to university. That year Watson also began a new and novel business venture alongside her younger brother, Alex, with whom she is very close. (He also has a background in fashion; in 2010, he starred in a campaign for Burberry with his sister.) Watson launched her own French-style gin, Renais, recalling her roots: Watson was born and lived near Paris until her parents divorced when she was five years old. The gin is made with sustainability in mind, and is very much anchored in the Watsons' family history. Their father, Chris, has owned vineyards in the Chablis region of Burgundy since the early nineties, and the siblings spent long periods of their childhood there, even participating in the grape harvest. Similar grapes are key to the character of this premium gin. Instagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. “To me, Renais is a family project; the Chablis region evokes very special memories of growing up. I've loved having the opportunity to create something with my brother Alex,” Watson said via a statement published in Wine Spectator. “I'm particularly proud of upcycling grapes from vineyards, including my dad's, to reduce waste and create something new.” The packaging is also sustainable. Watson has personally been in charge of the artistic design of its special editions, as she has shown her more than 73 million Instagram followers. The project is going so well that she and Alex recently received an investment of 5.8 million euros for the international expansion of Renais into more than a dozen countries, including the United States and Spain, where you can already find the gin in specialty stores. The fiercely private Watson does not share her university life on her social networks, but the Daily Mail recently photographed her taking part in one of Oxford's great traditions: acting as coxswain on a women's rowing team. The week before, the same tabloid reported on an alleged lakeside picnic date Watson had with a fellow student. Her last known relationship was with Brandon Green, son of businessman Sir Philip Green—although, again according to the Daily Mail, they broke up in 2023 after just over a year and a half together. Watson has always been very proud of her independence, and in fact coined the term “self-partnered.” The big question is when we will see Watson in the movies again. She reiterated to Vogue last year that her hiatus is not a retirement, and that in the future she sees herself acting in projects that she directs, writes and/or produces. She also remains close to the industry, as evidenced by her surprise appearance at the Cannes Film Festival in May, an event she hasn't attended since presenting Sofia Coppola's The Bling Ring in 2013. The Oxford Mail recently speculated that she is being considered to be the next Bond girl, a role that does not seem to fit precisely with her roadmap.

""I love the 'fled' thing,"" Jesse reacted to the rumors during the July 8 episode of SiriusXM's . ""I will confirm this now.

When she finished secondary school, she didn't immediately enter university because she was committed to filming the last two installments of the Harry Potter series. She took a gap year, then enrolled at Brown University to study English. Watson graduated in five years instead of four because she took two semesters off to film projects like My Week With Marilyn, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Bling Ring, This Is the End, and Noah. This time around, she has taken a complete hiatus from her film career so that it does not interfere with her education. But this is not the only reason she has stepped away from the movies. “I think I felt a bit caged,” Watson told the Financial Times in the spring of 2023, shortly before starting her master's degree. “The thing I found really hard was that I had to go out and sell something that I really didn't have very much control over. To stand in front of a film and have every journalist be able to say, 'How does this align with your viewpoint?' It was very difficult to have to be the face and the spokesperson for things where I didn't get to be involved in the process.” Some months later, in December 2023, she admitted to the British edition of Vogue that she was grateful for the respite she had taken. “I'm just so glad that I did [step away from acting] because I have this feeling of having my own voice and creative space and sovereignty in some way that I don't think I did before—more autonomy,” she said. “I'm so glad that I allowed things to be messy for a minute and to really allow myself to not know [what's next], because the knowing that I've come to, I wouldn't trade that for anything.” Watson used that creative space to make her directorial debut in 2022 with a short film for Prada Beauty's Paradoxe fragrance campaign; she also wrote the script and acted in it. In 2024, Watson became the face of Prada's Re-Nylon collection, made solely from nylon taken from the recycling and purification of plastic collected from the sea. Watson has been committed to sustainable fashion since she was a teenager. In 2009, she was already linked as a creative adviser to People Tree, one of the pioneers of ethical fashion. In 2020, she joined its board of directors. That same year, she also joined the board of directors of Kering, the luxury conglomerate that encompasses Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, to lead its sustainability committee. Watson was its youngest member at the time. She left the position in 2023, upon returning to school. That year Watson also began a new and novel business venture alongside her younger brother, Alex, with whom she is close. (He also has a background in fashion; in 2010, he starred in a campaign for Burberry with his sister.) Watson launched her own French-style gin, Renais, recalling her roots: She was born and lived near Paris until her parents divorced when she was five years old. The gin is made with sustainability in mind, and is very much anchored in the Watsons' family history. Their father, Chris, has owned vineyards in the Chablis region of Burgundy since the early '90s, and the siblings spent long periods of their childhood there, even participating in the grape harvest. Similar grapes are key to the character of this premium gin. Instagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. “To me, Renais is a family project; the Chablis region evokes very special memories of growing up. I've loved having the opportunity to create something with my brother Alex,” Watson said via a statement published in Wine Spectator. “I'm particularly proud of upcycling grapes from vineyards, including my dad's, to reduce waste and create something new.” The packaging is also sustainable. Watson has personally been in charge of the artistic design of its special editions, as she has shown her 73 million Instagram followers. The project is going so well that she and Alex recently received an investment of 5.8 million euros for the international expansion of Renais into more than a dozen countries, including the United States and Spain, where you can already find the gin in specialty stores. The fiercely private Watson does not share her university life on her social networks, but the Daily Mail recently photographed her taking part in one of Oxford's great traditions: acting as coxswain on a women's rowing team. The week before, the same tabloid reported on an alleged lakeside picnic date Watson had with a fellow student. Her last known relationship was with Brandon Green, son of businessman Sir Philip Green—although, again according to the Daily Mail, they broke up in 2023 after just over a year and a half together. Watson has always been proud of her independence, and in fact coined the term “self-partnered.” The big question is when we will see Watson in the movies again. She reiterated to Vogue last year that her hiatus is not a retirement, and that in the future she sees herself acting in projects that she directs, writes, and/or produces. She also remains close to the industry, as evidenced by her surprise appearance at the Cannes Film Festival in May, an event she hasn't attended since presenting Sofia Coppola's The Bling Ring in 2013. The Oxford Mail recently speculated that she is being considered to be the next Bond girl, a role that does not seem to fit precisely with her roadmap. But with a prestigious director like Denis Villeneuve attached to the project, who knows? Original story in VF Spain.

""Superman"" at TCL Chinese Theatre at TCL Chinese Theatre on July 07, 2025 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/WireImage)Matt WinkelmeyerSave this storySaveSave this storySave There's competition on the red carpet. Last month, Brad Pitt completed a highly successful fashion marathon while promoting his new project, F1. This month, it's Nicholas Hoult revealing himself as a real model before the eyes of photographers. The British actor first came to public attention at the age of 17 in the series Skins, alongside other future celebrities such as Dev Patel, Daniel Kaluuya, and Kaya Scodelario. Now in his thirties, he stars in Superman—in cinemas July 11—as the great villain Lex Luthor. After a successful 2024, where he starred in three major films—Juror No. 2, Nosferatu, and The Order—the actor is moving on to something even bigger. And he's well aware of the stakes, judging by his clothing choices during the Superman promotional tour, where he's been stealing the show even David Corenswet, who plays Superman himself. Like Pitt, Nicholas Hoult has relied on signature pieces to find his style. The actor is working with Jason Bolden, a stylist to the stars whose male clients include actors Michael B. Jordan and Aaron Pierre, as well as basketball player Stephen Curry. Together, the duo have created a capsule wardrobe, featuring timeless garments with a touch of modernity added through accessorizing or less classic pieces. The actor's fashion marathon began off the red carpet, with a brief (but noteworthy) stopover in New York.

A brown suit by Tom Ford, with an open jacket and beige cotton T-shirt for a semi-formal look. Hoult then appeared in a white tank top covered by a loose-fitting short-sleeved shirt, again in brown. The paparazzi also photographed him in a white wife-beater lightly covered by a gray sweater tied around his torso, accompanied by Céline jeans.

Specifically, the Prada Buckle bag seen with his last two outfits in the Big Apple. Brad Pitt also accessorized well on his F1 promotional tour, as does Jacob Elordi, a veritable collector of handbags. Hoult brought the same signature pieces—this time, coupled with Bottega Veneta's Weekender Getaway bag—during his visit to London. But instead of a white tank top, he wore a Prada outfit, consisting of a brown t-shirt (his new favorite color) with rolled-up sleeves and linen pants, and sunglasses hanging from his belt. He put his exposed biceps away for Superman's London premiere on July 3. Instead, he brought a suit out of his closet: one that was striped and signed Bottega Veneta. The following day, he appeared in a casual look with a Burberry leather jacket from the Winter 2025 collection.

F91233A6BD66151447D65234597CA668,"  In the sports world, some wives and girlfriends are more famous than the athletes they are watching. Fashion brands have noticed. As Wimbledon was underway this week, with players adhering to the tournament's strict all-white dress code, fashion watchers turned their attention to the stands, where personalities like Morgan Riddle, the fashion influencer and girlfriend of the American tennis player Taylor Fritz, brought a slightly bolder look to the Grand Slam. On Monday, the tournament's first day, Ms. Riddle wore a blush pink mini dress by Patou, paired with matching strawberry-adorned mules (a nod to the tournament's well-known strawberry and cream dish) and a red Chanel purse. Her blond hair was tied into a half up, half down style with face-framing tendrils. ''If I dressed incredibly inappropriately for Wimbledon, it would be blasted on social media almost instantly and people would probably troll him for it,'' Ms. Riddle said in an interview, referring to Mr. Fritz. Her wardrobe teems with skirts, dresses, blazers and button-down shirts from brands like Thom Browne, Miu Miu and Burberry -- a far cry from her early days on tour with Mr. Fritz, whom she began a relationship with in 2020. Back then, Ms. Riddle, who did not grow up watching tennis, favored jeans, crop tops and sweatshirts. But as she became more enmeshed in the world of the elite sport, her style evolved to meet its expectations. While Wimbledon does not enforce a dress code for spectators, attendees are encouraged to dress ''smart.'' For men, that typically means tailored separates in muted tones; for women, sundresses and low heels. Ms. Riddle takes it a step further. She is polished from every angle, with every sartorial detail deliberate. That's partly because she is a WAG. The term WAG, an acronym used to refer to the wives and girlfriends of sports stars, gained popularity in the British tabloids in the early 2000s, when it was often attached to the glamorous partners of male soccer players. It reached a fever pitch during the 2006 World Cup, when figures like Victoria Beckham were covered almost as closely as the players themselves were. WAGs have taken on a second life in the American sports world, linked to basketball, football and, more recently, Formula 1 and tennis. Vogue called the summer, packed with the N.B.A. playoffs, the U.S. Open, the Stanley Cup and more, ''WAG season,'' spotlighting figures like Jordyn Woods, an influencer and the girlfriend of the Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns as well as Kendall Murray, whose partner is Braiden McGregor of the New York Jets. Publications like Glamour published ''get the look'' edits inspired by Taylor Swift's game day outfits as she watched her boyfriend, Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs, play. Fashion brands have taken note. They're not just dressing the athletes anymore, but their partners, too -- for games, appearances and front rows. Reformation leaned in directly, debuting a collection last month designed for tennis spectators with the tagline: ''Those who can't play, watch.'' As interest in the styling choices of WAGs grows, the question becomes: What even is WAG style? Andrew Pokorny, a television producer who worked on ''WAGs Miami,'' a reality series from E! that aired in the mid-2010s, said that while there was not a singular look, most WAGs followed styling codes. For him, it comes down to one thing: projecting wealth. ''The bank account that they have access to, either through marriage or because they've been given beautiful gifts by their partners, does signal access to an elite club,'' Mr. Pokorny said. Bags from Louis Vuitton, Hermès and Fendi are mainstays, as are shoes from Christian Louboutin. But the illusion of wealth matters, too. According to Mr. Pokorny, many women on the show did not want to be seen in the same outfit twice, and they often worked with fast fashion companies like Fashion Nova to maintain the appearance of an endless wardrobe. In 2016, when the show was filming, that led to some flashy choices. But today's most visible WAGs opt for a more understated look. ''Whether it's ostentatious or subverted, it's always intentional,'' Mr. Pokorny said. '' These WAGs know that people are looking at them. It just depends on what's called for at the time.'' The performance of femininity is also crucial to WAG style, said Judy Liao, a professor at the University of Alberta who researches the sociology of sport and gender. In elite men's sports, women have traditionally been sidelined, seen by many as accessories helping to bolster their partner's masculinity rather than as ardent fans or active participants. What a WAG wears, and how she carries herself, can play a key role in that performance, Dr. Liao said. She sees the resurgence of the WAG as partly a pushback to the growing visibility of women's sports and of bodies that fall outside what she calls the Western ideal of femininity and heteronormativity. ''They're too strong, too Black or too queer,'' she said. '' That's still slightly challenging for the North American mainstream audience to really digest.'' ''WAGs really kind of offer the mainstream media this really good material to say, 'We support gender equality because we're showing women in sport,''' Dr. Liao added. '' But it's not the women who are actually playing the sports.'' Athletes themselves have noticed. In April, Daria Saville, the Australian professional tennis player, took to TikTok to express frustration over women tennis players being passed over for brand partnerships in favor of WAGs. Women who, she said, fit the tennis aesthetic that brands were profiting from. There has been, however, a growing trend of brands tapping women athletes for campaigns and endorsement deals. They include the W.N.B.A. player Angel Reese (Good American), the tennis star Coco Gauff (New Balance) and the rugby player Ilona Maher (Maybelline). But WAGs continue to thrive, with some developing larger social media followings than their partners. Sartorially, though, most roads lead back to the athlete. Dressing often becomes a form of fashion diplomacy, echoing the way political spouses represent their partners abroad....","In the sports world, some wives and girlfriends are more famous than the athletes they are watching.

mov_F4B73889A6C1322E2A7B32A7CC6D7CED,"  Sign Up for Gems of Wisdom Anyone who follows the British royal family will have come across the phenomenon that is known as the Kate Effect. Referring to the way in which the Princess of Wales wearing an outfit or piece of jewelry can lead to items selling out online in minutes and even websites crashing, it has been a firm feature of the royal narrative ever since Kate came on the scene. So the announcement this summer that the Princess, along with Prince William, will now have the power to grant Royal Warrants comes with a significant dose of anticipation for the businesses who may be in the running to receive one. She will be the first Princess of Wales to be a grantor in more than 100 years. But, perhaps more pertinently, the first ever to make such endorsements in the online shopping era. “There is a large swath of royal watchers who came to follow the royal family through her and, importantly, shop the brands she wears,” Elizabeth Holmes, author of the New York Times bestseller, HRH: So Many Thoughts on Royal Style, tells T&C. “I think the Princess now being able to grant royal warrants will introduce this honor in a new way to a new generation of royal watchers.” So what exactly is this coveted honor and who is eligible? A Royal Warrant is an official mark of recognition for individuals or companies who have regularly supplied goods or services to the royal household. A business must have supplied a royal for at least five out of the last seven years to qualify and must now also demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. The range of holders covers everything from clothing to food and drink to cleaning products and services, stationery, transport and home and gardening services. Holders can describe themselves as “by appointment” to the royals and display the arms belonging to the royal who selected them on their products and packaging. “A Royal Warrant is seen by many firms as the gold standard of endorsements,” says royal journalist Richard Palmer. “It's an honor but more importantly it's of commercial value…Kate's warrant will be especially sought after.” Shop Kate's Wardrobe Staples McQueen Classic Single-Breasted Suiting Blazer Kiki McDonough Classics Green Amethyst Pear Drop Earrings Mulberry Amberley Clutch Emmy London Rebecca High Heel After Queen Elizabeth's death there was a review of Royal Warrants and for a while King Charles was the only grantor. Queen Camilla has since been appointed a grantor, and she now has 14 warrants while the King has 586. The Palace announced that William and Kate will award their first warrants in a two-step process. Firstly, companies with warrants from the King or Queen can apply to also be endorsed by William or Kate. Those applications are open now and the selections will be announced next spring. Next year, applications will be open to other companies. So who might Kate choose? Intriguingly, while there is no requirement for warrant-holders to be British-owned or UK-based, William's private secretary made it clear that this is the route the couple plan to take. “Their Royal Highnesses are delighted to be able to recognise and celebrate British industry, creativity and skills through the granting of Warrants,” Ian Patrick said. Two favorite clothing brands of Kate's, Burberry and Barbour, already hold warrants from the King. She could also potentially add her endorsement to milliner Philip Treacy, who has a warrant from the Queen. In new appointments, several experts have suggested that her go-to designers Catherine Walker and Jenny Packham are at the top of the list of contenders. “Key factors are likely to include a brand's history and heritage, its role in British culture and contributions to the community, as well as its corporate governance and business practices,” Susan Kelley, founder of website What Kate Wore, tells T&C. Kelley cites labels including “Catherine Walker, Erdem, Beulah London, Jenny Packham, and perhaps a childrenswear brand like Trotters London,” as contenders. “Brora, a clothing brand specializing in cashmere manufactured using heritage textile mills in Scotland, seems a very good candidate for recognition, as do Campbell's of Beauly and Dubarry of Ireland,” she says. “I do wonder if Kate, who has mastered the art of high-low dressing, will include more affordable brands in her royal warrant selection,” says Elizabeth Holmes. “Her high street choices have made her seem accessible in a novel way, and I'm certain the impact on those brands would be sizable should she choose to recognize them.” Shop Kate's Wardrobe Staples Jenny Packham Georgia Embellished Sequined Tulle Gown Monica Vinader Siren Gemstone Wire Earrings LK Bennett Dora Green Suede Envelope Clutch Penelope Chilvers Tassel Knee High Boot Royal fashion expert Christine Ross also points out that the impact of a warrant could be more measurable if Kate chooses smaller or more affordable brands. “A brand's accessibility in both price and international delivery would be key to their Royal Warrant leading to success,” she adds. Kate's influence on the British fashion industry is so often highlighted, with figures such as her boosting it by an estimated £1 billion annually repeatedly cited. But there is a point to be made about to what extent she will want to highlight fashion with her first tranche of appointments. “The royal warrants come at an interesting time in the broader royal fashion conversation,” Elizabeth Holmes says. “So much has been made about whether or not to discuss the Princess's wardrobe, and where she wants the focus to be. That sentiment seems to have been walked back, and we've seen a number of fashion-focused moments this year, but it will be interesting to see the types of warrants she grants, and what share of those are clothing and accessories versus other categories.” “I suspect their first few Royal Warrants will be conservatively chosen,” says Christine Ross....","Sign Up for Gems of Wisdom Anyone who follows the British royal family will have come across the phenomenon that is known as the Kate Effect.

The focus will be on British-owned or UK-based businesses. A Royal Warrant serves as an official mark of recognition for companies that have regularly supplied goods or services to the royal household. Businesses must have supplied a royal for at least five of the past seven years and demonstrate sustainability commitments to qualify. “A Royal Warrant is seen by many firms as the gold standard of endorsements,” royal journalist Richard Palmer said. “It's an honour, but more importantly, it's of commercial value…Kate's warrant will be especially sought after.”","Princess Kate's new power is expected to have a huge impact on the British fashion industry, several commentators have claimed. The Princess of Wales will become the first holder of her title in more than a century to grant Royal Warrants, and many believe she will use her newly appointed power to promote British fashion houses. Several of these brands appear well-positioned for royal endorsement. Burberry and Barbour, two brands that Kate loves, already hold warrants from the King and could receive additional recognition. Meanwhile, milliner Philip Treacy holds a warrant from Queen Camilla. Princess Kate set for billion-pound impact as she gains major power. Getty The Princess's endorsements are arriving in the digital shopping age, where the “Kate Effect” has become legendary. Items she wears routinely sell out within minutes online, with websites sometimes crashing under demand. “There is a large swath of royal watchers who came to follow the Royal Family through her and, importantly, shop the brands she wears,” Elizabeth Holmes, author of HRH: So Many Thoughts on Royal Style, told Town & Country. Catherine Walker and Jenny Packham, two design houses loved by Kate, have emerged as leading contenders for new appointments. “Key factors are likely to include a brand's history and heritage, its role in British culture and contributions to the community, as well as its corporate governance and business practices,” Susan Kelley, founder of What Kate Wore, told the publication.

mov_657C6493F0689EBFEA60B957A70E22EB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Apenas unas semanas antes de su juicio, un exoficial de Aduanas y Protección Fronteriza de Estados Unidos admitió haber conspirado con narcotraficantes mexicanos para permitir que fentanilo, cocaína y metanfetamina pasaran sin control por sus carriles de inspección en el puerto de entrada de Tecate. Jesse Clark García se declaró culpable el martes en un tribunal federal de San Diego de nueve cargos relacionados con la importación de drogas. En su acuerdo de culpabilidad, admitió que él y otro exoficial de la CBP, Diego Bonillo, conspiraron con una organización narcotraficante mexicana no identificada para hacerse de la vista gorda mientras vehículos cargados de narcóticos pasaban por sus carriles de inspección. Bonillo se declaró inocente de cargos similares y su juicio está previsto para finales de mes. García enfrenta una pena de entre 10 años y cadena perpetua cuando sea sentenciado, y una posible multa de hasta 10 millones de dólares. Su abogado se negó a comentar sobre su declaración de culpabilidad el miércoles. Los fiscales alegaron que García y Bonillo se lucraron generosamente con la conspiración criminal, obteniendo decenas de miles de dólares por cada vehículo cargado de drogas que introdujeron en Estados Unidos sin escrutinio. La acusación formal alegó que ambos hombres permitieron el ingreso de más de 500 kilos de drogas a Estados Unidos en cinco ocasiones entre abril de 2021 y febrero de 2024, aunque esa cifra solo incluía las drogas que las autoridades incautaron posteriormente. Documentos judiciales presentados por los fiscales el año pasado indicaban que García “vivía con un salario muy superior al que le correspondía en la CBP” y hacían referencia a su copropiedad de un establo de carreras de caballos, la propiedad de varios vehículos, una casa en San Diego, un rancho en construcción en México y la compra de artículos de lujo de las marcas Burberry y Louis Vuitton. Tanto García como Bonillo fueron arrestados en mayo de 2024 como resultado de una investigación dirigida por el Grupo de Trabajo contra la Corrupción Fronteriza de la oficina local del FBI en San Diego. Según la acusación y otros registros judiciales, los investigadores creían que la actividad delictiva de García comenzó en abril de 2021. Una investigación posterior reveló patrones de presuntos narcotraficantes que solían cruzar el puerto de entrada de Tecate solo cuando García trabajaba y solo por su carril. La fiscalía alegó que algunos de esos mismos vehículos o conductores también pasaban regularmente por el carril de Bonilla en el puerto de entrada de Otay Mesa. La fiscalía alegó que, cerca del final de la investigación por corrupción el año pasado, García cruzó la frontera hacia México con un vehículo lleno y dejó de presentarse a trabajar. Solo regresó a Estados Unidos después de que las autoridades mexicanas lo arrestaran y lo entregaran a las autoridades estadounidenses en la frontera de Arizona. Agentes del FBI arrestaron a Bonillo unos días después en Las Vegas, donde la fiscalía alega que se alojaba en un hotel de lujo y tenía entradas de 2000 dólares para un combate de boxeo de alto perfil. “No toleramos la mala conducta dentro de nuestras filas”, declaró un portavoz de la CBP el año pasado en respuesta a preguntas sobre los agentes. Cuando descubrimos cualquier presunta o posible falta de conducta, la remitimos de inmediato a investigación y cooperamos plenamente con cualquier investigación penal o administrativa. García y Bonillo fueron arrestados un mes antes de que su excolega, Leonard Darnell George, fuera a juicio por un caso similar, pero no relacionado. George fue sentenciado a 23 años de prisión después de que un jurado lo declarara culpable de permitir el paso de drogas y migrantes indocumentados por el puerto de entrada de San Ysidro a cambio de cientos de miles de dólares en sobornos.

mov_DF5998B17D0D44AE1FCDB3D6D22F61CF,"  The latest earnings season kicks off in the week ahead, with a number of companies across a range of sectors due to report. Results from the major US investment banks act as the traditional starting gun for earnings season, with Goldman Sachs (GS) among those due to report. Another big name set to report in the coming week is Netflix (NFLX), with the stock trading near record highs, as the streaming giant has appeared to remain relatively insulated from tariff shocks that have weighed on other tech companies. In the semiconductor sector, TSMC (2330. TW, TSM) earnings will be in focus, given the company is the world's largest contract chipmaker so is considered a bellwether for the global industry. Dutch company ASML (ASML.AS, ASML), which is also set to report, is another company considered to act as a barometer for the health of the chip sector as its lithography machines are used to make semiconductors. What could trigger a late summer crisis for markets in the third quarter? Back on the London market, investors will be keeping an eye on Burberry's (BRBY.L) latest trading update, to see how the luxury fashion brand's turnaround efforts are progressing. Here's more on what to look out for: Major investment banks have become more bullish in their outlook for US stocks this year, looking past near-term uncertainties. Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs (GS) became the latest bank to raise its year-target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index, from 6,100 to 6,600 points. The index closed at 6,280.46 points on Thursday, having risen 6.8% year-to-date. According to a Reuters report, Goldman analysts said in a note on Monday: ""A resilient outlook for 2026 earnings growth, the resumption of Fed rate cuts, and neutral investor positioning argue for further market upside as the recent narrow rally broadens."" Bank of America (BAC) also lifted its S&P 500 (^GSPC) target this week, while Barclays (BARC.L), Citigroup (C) and Deutsche Bank (DBK.DE) raised theirs last month. Goldman appeared to benefit from market volatility in the first quarter, with its revenue from equities trading up 27% year-on-year to $4.19bn (£3.09bn), as investors sought to adjust their portfolios amid tariff turmoil. The firm's total revenue in the first quarter rose 6% to $15.06bn, which beat analyst consensus of $14.8bn, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $14.12 also came in ahead of expectations and was up from $11.58n in the first quarter of 2024. Goldman shares have rebounded from a fall following US president Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement, and have gained nearly 24% year-to-date, with the stock hitting a fresh high on Monday. While the firm didn't offer specific guidance in those results in April, Goldman CEO David Solomon said at the time that it was ""entering the second quarter with a markedly different operating environment than earlier this year"". Goldman is due to release its second quarter results on Wednesday, along with Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (MS). The day before JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup, BlackRock (BLK) and BNY Mellon (BK) are set to release their latest earnings. The final series of Squid Game and the latest season of Black Mirror were among the big Netflix releases on the streaming platform in the second quarter. In the first quarter, hit shows including the series Adolescence and the film Back in Action, starring Cameron Diaz, helped keep audiences hooked on the platform. Revenue came in at $10.54bn in the first quarter, which was up 12.5% year-on-year and slightly higher than Bloomberg analyst expectations of $10.5bn. Earnings per share of $6.61 also beat analyst estimates of $5.68. Netflix's revenue guidance of $11.04bn for the second quarter was also higher than the $10.88bn analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. The streamer has forecasted earnings per share of $7.03 for the second quarter. For full-year 2025, the company reiterated its prior forecast of $43.5bn to $44.5bn revenue growth and operating margins of 29%. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Netflix has been able to demonstrate its qualities as a recession and tariff resilient business, right at a time when those two traits are highly sought after. Add in strong fundamentals, plus good execution, and it's not too surprising to see Netflix flirting with all-time highs as we look ahead to second quarter results next week."" UK economy shrinks for second month in a row Since the company released its first quarter results, its shares have continued to climb, ending June at another record high and the stock is now up nearly 41% year-to-date. ""Netflix doesn't release subscriber growth numbers anymore, so analysts will have to make do with some traditional metrics,"" Britzman said. ""Operating margins will be in focus, with improvements in the last quarter expected to repeat next week as 33% has been touted as the target number."" He added: ""Things are expected to dip in the second half as content spend ramps up but there's scope for full year expectations to move higher if a solid margin number gets printed next week."" Chipmaker TSMC (2330. TW, TSM) released its first half revenue figures on Thursday, giving investors a sense of how it has performed since the start of the year ahead of its latest results. TSMC's revenue for April to June came in at $933.8bn Taiwan dollars (£23.6bn), according to Reuters, which was up nearly 39% on the same period last year and beat an LSEG SmartEstimate of $927.831bn Taiwan dollars. For June, TSMC posted revenue of approximately $263.71bn Taiwan dollars, which was down 17.7% on May but was nearly 27% higher than the same month last year. Revenue for January through June totalled $1.77tn Taiwan dollars, which was up 40% on the first six months of last year. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: ""Trading at TSMC remains robust despite a mix of currency headwinds and tariff turmoil, showing just how powerful and resilient the AI theme is proving to be. ""Companies continue to spend heavily in trying to get ahead in artificial intelligence and this benefits businesses such as TSMC which provide the required infrastructure."" Earlier this week, Trump said that tariffs on chips would soon be announced, though TSMC has been investing more in its operations in America. In March, TSMC announced plans to expand its investment in manufacturing in the US by $100bn, on top of the $65bn it was already putting behind its operations in Arizona. Stocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio In addition, TSMC CEO CC Wei said at the company's annual shareholders meeting last month that tariffs ""do have some impact on TSMC, but not directly"". ""That's because tariffs are imposed on importers, not exporters,"" he said, according to a Reuters report. ""TSMC is an exporter. However, tariffs can lead to slightly higher prices, and when prices go up, demand may go down."" ""If demand drops, TSMC's business could be affected,"" he added....","The latest earnings season kicks off in the week ahead, with a number of companies across a range of sectors due to report.

According to a Reuters report, Goldman analysts said in a note on Monday: ""A resilient outlook for 2026 earnings growth, the resumption of Fed rate cuts, and neutral investor positioning argue for further market upside as the recent narrow rally broadens."" Bank of America (BAC) also lifted its S&P 500 (^GSPC) target this week, while Barclays (BARC.L), Citigroup (C) and Deutsche Bank (DBK.DE) raised theirs last month. Goldman appeared to benefit from market volatility in the first quarter, with its revenue from equities trading up 27% year-on-year to $4.19bn (£3.09bn), as investors sought to adjust their portfolios amid tariff turmoil. The firm's total revenue in the first quarter rose 6% to $15.06bn, which beat analyst consensus of $14.8bn, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $14.12 also came in ahead of expectations and was up from $11.58n in the first quarter of 2024. Goldman shares have rebounded from a fall following US president Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement, and have gained nearly 24% year-to-date, with the stock hitting a fresh high on Monday. While the firm didn't offer specific guidance in those results in April, Goldman CEO David Solomon said at the time that it was ""entering the second quarter with a markedly different operating environment than earlier this year"". Goldman is due to release its second quarter results on Wednesday, along with Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (MS). The day before JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup, BlackRock (BLK) and BNY Mellon (BK) are set to release their latest earnings. The final series of Squid Game and the latest season of Black Mirror were among the big Netflix releases on the streaming platform in the second quarter. In the first quarter, hit shows including the series Adolescence and the film Back in Action, starring Cameron Diaz, helped keep audiences hooked on the platform. Revenue came in at $10.54bn in the first quarter, which was up 12.5% year-on-year and slightly higher than Bloomberg analyst expectations of $10.5bn. Earnings per share of $6.61 also beat analyst estimates of $5.68. Netflix's revenue guidance of $11.04bn for the second quarter was also higher than the $10.88bn analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. The streamer has forecasted earnings per share of $7.03 for the second quarter. For full-year 2025, the company reiterated its prior forecast of $43.5bn to $44.5bn revenue growth and operating margins of 29%. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Netflix has been able to demonstrate its qualities as a recession and tariff resilient business, right at a time when those two traits are highly sought after. Add in strong fundamentals, plus good execution, and it's not too surprising to see Netflix flirting with all-time highs as we look ahead to second quarter results next week."" UK economy shrinks for second month in a row Since the company released its first quarter results, its shares have continued to climb, ending June at another record high and the stock is now up nearly 41% year-to-date. ""Netflix doesn't release subscriber growth numbers anymore, so analysts will have to make do with some traditional metrics,"" Britzman said. ""Operating margins will be in focus, with improvements in the last quarter expected to repeat next week as 33% has been touted as the target number."" He added: ""Things are expected to dip in the second half as content spend ramps up but there's scope for full year expectations to move higher if a solid margin number gets printed next week."" Chipmaker TSMC (2330. TW, TSM) released its first half revenue figures on Thursday, giving investors a sense of how it has performed since the start of the year ahead of its latest results. TSMC's revenue for April to June came in at $933.8bn Taiwan dollars (£23.6bn), according to Reuters, which was up nearly 39% on the same period last year and beat an LSEG SmartEstimate of $927.831bn Taiwan dollars. For June, TSMC posted revenue of approximately $263.71bn Taiwan dollars, which was down 17.7% on May but was nearly 27% higher than the same month last year. Revenue for January through June totalled $1.77tn Taiwan dollars, which was up 40% on the first six months of last year. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: ""Trading at TSMC remains robust despite a mix of currency headwinds and tariff turmoil, showing just how powerful and resilient the AI theme is proving to be. ""Companies continue to spend heavily in trying to get ahead in artificial intelligence and this benefits businesses such as TSMC which provide the required infrastructure."" Earlier this week, Trump said that tariffs on chips would soon be announced, though TSMC has been investing more in its operations in America. In March, TSMC announced plans to expand its investment in manufacturing in the US by $100bn, on top of the $65bn it was already putting behind its operations in Arizona. Stocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio In addition, TSMC CEO CC Wei said at the company's annual shareholders meeting last month that tariffs ""do have some impact on TSMC, but not directly"". ""That's because tariffs are imposed on importers, not exporters,"" he said, according to a Reuters report. ""TSMC is an exporter. However, tariffs can lead to slightly higher prices, and when prices go up, demand may go down."" ""If demand drops, TSMC's business could be affected,"" he added....",2025-07-11 11:35:14,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The text briefly mentions Burberry only in the context of a general earnings report and market update, with no substantive discussion of the brand's fragrances, products, or brand-specific details.

mov_4110D25BB5D2AC08F1D238D049BEF656,"  SPR_COMBO[it]A quasi 30 anni dal loro esordio, gli Oasis sono tornati a dominare la scena – non solo musicale, ma anche della cultura di branding. Con il reunion tour finalmente in corso, il capitale culturale della band sembra più attuale che mai: streetwear, moda premium, retail pop-up e attivazioni ironiche sfruttano il ritorno di Liam e Noel per connettersi con una community transgenerazionale, attraverso nostalgia, identità e fandom. A guidare l'ondata è Adidas Originals , che a giugno ha lanciato una collaborazione ad alto profilo con la band. Anticipata sui social e svelata in TV su Channel 4, la campagna è accompagnata da Live Forever (1994), con un mix di filmati d'archivio e nuove clip dei fratelli Gallagher. In evidenza, i prodotti-guida della collezione: tute, maglie raglan, bucket hat e coach jacket. Non si tratta solo di merchandising, ma di storytelling condiviso. Adidas fa parte del look Oasis fin dai loro albori, e il claim “Original Forever” riscrive quella narrativa per le nuove generazioni. Anche Levi's ha realizzato una capsule di T-shirt in edizione limitata, ma la Oasis Mania va oltre lo streetwear e il denim. Burberry ha lanciato una campagna con Liam Gallagher e i suoi figli Lennon, Gene e Molly, insieme a volti noti come Goldie, Cara Delevingne e Alexa Chung, con uno styling che richiama l'era d'oro Burberry degli anni '90., mentre Stone Island ha scelto Liam come volto della campagna autunnale. Non si tratta solo di endorsement: l'artista è il concept. Oltre all'impatto culturale, c'è quello di business: secondo Barclays , i fan UK degli Oasis spenderanno oltre 1 miliardo di sterline tra biglietti, viaggi e merchandising – più di quanto registrato dai fan di Taylor Swift in occasione dell'Eras Tour, con sole 2 date in più. Nel cuore di Londra, il temporary store Oasis in Carnaby Street è già meta di pellegrinaggio per fan e curiosi. T-shirt, hoodie, bucket hat, poster e vinili in edizione limitata – inclusa la collezione Adidas Originals x Oasis – rendono il punto vendita un'esperienza immersiva che unisce musica e moda. Anche i retailer più mainstream si inseriscono nel trend. Primark ha celebrato la data di apertura del tour a Manchester con una campagna social che chiedeva ai fan di scegliere il loro Gallagher preferito, e un attivazione sul punto vendita con die ingressi separati: Liam e Noel. Lidl , invece, giocando sull'ironi, ha lanciato  Lidl by Lidl, una giacca da concerto in edizione limitata, presentata oltre che sul proprio sito web su un murale nei pressi dell'Etihad Stadium. Prezzo: £30. Caratteristiche: tasche refrigeranti, apribottiglie. Ovviamente esaurita, ma i fan possono approfittare del  prossimo drop: il Lidl  by Lidl bucket hat. Il tutto con finalità benefica a favore dell'NSPCC. Sul fronte digitale, abbiamo già segnalato come  Warner Music abbia attivato uno shop ufficiale con merch esclusivo su Amazon , permettendo ai fan di tutto il mondo di acquistare al di là delle date del tour o delle attivazioni locali. Un chiaro segnale: il fandom va oltre il live, e si costruisce anche attraverso una distribuzione scalabile. Sullo sfondo, parka e bucket hat sono l'ossessione della stagione, che qualche professionista dell'abbigliamento definisce ha già definito la “Wonderwall Summer”. L'Oasis Mania non è solo un ritorno nostalgico. È un caso di piattaforma culturale attiva : tra collaborazioni fashion, campagne streetwear, progetti retail e attivazioni ironiche, i Gallagher rimangono tra i pochi artisti capaci di connettere generazioni e sottoculture. E in un momento in cui i brand cercano autenticità, emozione e narrazione, Oasis è ancora una colonna sonora che fa vendere.","SPR_COMBO[it]A quasi 30 anni dal loro esordio, gli Oasis sono tornati a dominare la scena – non solo musicale, ma anche della cultura di branding.

Long story short, the descriptions just do not compute for me. This isn't just with cologne either, but also weed. When someone describes something as nutty or woody, I do not get that at all. I don't smell almond or vanilla, but I do smell the baby powered smell I've seen people use to describe it. So idk. Hoping to just kind of use examples of the vibes I like and see if maybe someone can point me in the right direction. I've used AI to the best of my ability with this, but it refuses to give me actual recommendations outside ones I've already tried (and told it about) and the same handful. Also, the relevant factors coming into play outside of preference are: - I'm 35; - I work in the legal field; and - I'm a cigarette smoker So, when I was young my go-to was Abercrombie fierce, then graduating to aqua De Gio as one did from 2005-2011, perhaps they still do idk lol. Those are too “fresh” and “young” to me tho nowadays. I wore guilty by Gucci & Gucci by Gucci in the past and would fluctuate between really liking one and not the other.

But I very much enjoy the “complexity” or “layers” I guess you'd say? And despite being a sweeter smell it endures cigarettes well. Sauvage is good until it isn't. No disrespect but I get axe body spray vibes from it but the grown up version. Bleu is awesome but everyone I know has it. My ex got me a jimmy choo one that I can't recall the exact name of that was so-so but didn't really blow my hair back. Would love you feedback on what u think I should look into more.

tw_sl_9e5e3e0c48c23eddc1c3991d3131eb2d,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]Durante anos, ter um Tesla em Portugal era uma afirmação. Representava inovação tecnológica, consciência ambiental e, sobretudo, distinção social. Não era apenas um automóvel — era símbolo de vanguarda, de luxo moderno sobre quatro rodas. Hoje, basta abrir a aplicação da Uber ou da Bolt para perceber o que se perdeu: o Tesla tornou-se banal. Democratizou-se, dirão uns; perdeu a alma, digo eu. Nas grandes cidades, os Model 3 e Y circulam em massa ao serviço das plataformas TVDE. São ferramentas de trabalho, conduzidas por motoristas muitas vezes em condições laborais precárias, com horários longos, cheiros duvidosos e contratos frágeis. O prestígio da marca, ironicamente, facilitou essa massificação — mas isso é insustentável. Ou não? Depende do objectivo… A economia ensina-nos que bens de luxo não seguem as mesmas regras dos bens comuns: o seu valor reside também na exclusividade. O economista Thorstein Veblen foi pioneiro ao estudar este fenómeno. No final do século XIX, cunhou o conceito de “consumo conspícuo”: bens cuja procura aumenta à medida que o seu preço sobe, precisamente porque sinalizam riqueza, sucesso e pertença a uma elite. São bens comprados não apenas pela sua utilidade, mas pelo que representam socialmente. O luxo, nesta lógica, não é acessório — é o produto. É por isso que um relógio Patek Philippe, uma carteira Hermès ou um Bentley valem o que valem. São difíceis de obter, exclusivos por natureza, e intencionalmente assim. O Tesla, no auge, cumpria essa função: era caro, ecológico e tecnologicamente avançado — logo, para muitos, desejável. Mas com a sua proliferação nas ruas, perdeu esse halo. Tornou-se o novo Peugeot, Renault ou Dacia do século XXI: funcional, acessível, repetitivo. Uma máquina de costura Singer com rodas, feita para coser percursos sem qualquer emoção. Nada contra essas marcas francesas — são práticas, eficientes — mas pertencem a outro segmento, por exemplo quando comparadas com marcas premium alemãs como a Mercedes ou BMW. O Tesla, ao deixar-se banalizar, diluiu-se. Hoje, muitos que compram um Tesla de €40.000-50.000 fazem-no por leasing ou crédito, muitas vezes sem capacidade real para absorver choques económicos. Confunde-se acesso temporário com posse verdadeira. É uma democratização ilusória, onde o luxo se transforma num bem indistinto e desprovido de valor simbólico. Este modelo de consumo — “tudo para todos, a prestações” — é perigoso. Cria endividamento, distorce a perceção de riqueza real e inflaciona artificialmente o mercado automóvel. O leasing automóvel generalizado é o novo subprime da classe média: uma bolha de consumo sustentada em rendimentos instáveis. Isso enfraquece famílias e corrói a função distintiva das marcas. Quando tudo é “premium”, nada o é. A história está cheia de exemplos. A Burberry enfrentou uma crise reputacional quando se tornou demasiado acessível. A Mercedes viu a sua imagem seriamente abalada quando integrou motores Renault-Nissan em modelos como o Classe A, B ou GLA. A recuperação passou por reposicionar a marca, recentrar na qualidade e revalorizar a exclusividade (com motores Mercedes). A Tesla parece ir no sentido contrário: entrega a sua imagem às frotas e incentiva uma falsa acessibilidade via financiamento fácil. À boleia da transição energética e da ansiedade ecológica, vende-se a ideia de que “todos devem ter um Tesla” ou “todos podem ter um Tesla”. Mas um bem de luxo que todos têm… deixa de o ser. O Tesla tornou-se o uniforme da classe média urbana globalizada — um símbolo reciclado em produto de massas. É mimetismo social com ar ecológico: carneirada travestida de consciência individual.

Sozinhos, claro, dentro do seu Tesla....","SPR_COMBO[pt]Durante anos, ter um Tesla em Portugal era uma afirmação. Representava inovação tecnológica, consciência ambiental e, sobretudo, distinção social. Não era apenas um automóvel — era símbolo de vanguarda, de luxo moderno sobre quatro rodas. Hoje, basta abrir a aplicação da Uber ou da Bolt para perceber o que se perdeu: o Tesla tornou-se banal. Democratizou-se, dirão uns; perdeu a alma, digo eu. Nas grandes cidades, os Model 3 e Y circulam em massa ao serviço das plataformas TVDE. São ferramentas de trabalho, conduzidas por motoristas muitas vezes em condições laborais precárias, com horários longos, cheiros duvidosos e contratos frágeis. O prestígio da marca, ironicamente, facilitou essa massificação — mas isso é insustentável. Ou não? Depende do objectivo… A economia ensina-nos que bens de luxo não seguem as mesmas regras dos bens comuns: o seu valor reside também na exclusividade. O economista Thorstein Veblen foi pioneiro ao estudar este fenómeno. No final do século XIX, cunhou o conceito de “consumo conspícuo”: bens cuja procura aumenta à medida que o seu preço sobe, precisamente porque sinalizam riqueza, sucesso e pertença a uma elite. São bens comprados não apenas pela sua utilidade, mas pelo que representam socialmente. O luxo, nesta lógica, não é acessório — é o produto. É por isso que um relógio Patek Philippe, uma carteira Hermès ou um Bentley valem o que valem. São difíceis de obter, exclusivos por natureza, e intencionalmente assim. O Tesla, no auge, cumpria essa função: era caro, ecológico e tecnologicamente avançado — logo, para muitos, desejável. Mas com a sua proliferação nas ruas, perdeu esse halo. Tornou-se o novo Peugeot, Renault ou Dacia do século XXI: funcional, acessível, repetitivo. Uma máquina de costura Singer com rodas, feita para coser percursos sem qualquer emoção. Nada contra essas marcas francesas — são práticas, eficientes — mas pertencem a outro segmento, por exemplo quando comparadas com marcas premium alemãs como a Mercedes ou BMW. O Tesla, ao deixar-se banalizar, diluiu-se. Hoje, muitos que compram um Tesla de €40.000-50.000 fazem-no por leasing ou crédito, muitas vezes sem capacidade real para absorver choques económicos. Confunde-se acesso temporário com posse verdadeira. É uma democratização ilusória, onde o luxo se transforma num bem indistinto e desprovido de valor simbólico. Este modelo de consumo — “tudo para todos, a prestações” — é perigoso. Cria endividamento, distorce a perceção de riqueza real e inflaciona artificialmente o mercado automóvel. O leasing automóvel generalizado é o novo subprime da classe média: uma bolha de consumo sustentada em rendimentos instáveis. Isso enfraquece famílias e corrói a função distintiva das marcas. Quando tudo é “premium”, nada o é. A história está cheia de exemplos. A Burberry enfrentou uma crise reputacional quando se tornou demasiado acessível. A Mercedes viu a sua imagem seriamente abalada quando integrou motores Renault-Nissan em modelos como o Classe A, B ou GLA. A recuperação passou por reposicionar a marca, recentrar na qualidade e revalorizar a exclusividade (com motores Mercedes). A Tesla parece ir no sentido contrário: entrega a sua imagem às frotas e incentiva uma falsa acessibilidade via financiamento fácil. À boleia da transição energética e da ansiedade ecológica, vende-se a ideia de que “todos devem ter um Tesla” ou “todos podem ter um Tesla”. Mas um bem de luxo que todos têm… deixa de o ser. O Tesla tornou-se o uniforme da classe média urbana globalizada — um símbolo reciclado em produto de massas. É mimetismo social com ar ecológico: carneirada travestida de consciência individual. E aqui Veblen continua atual: o consumo de bens de luxo é, muitas vezes, guiado por um impulso de distinção — de se destacar da multidão.

mov_C0EB683A05DC0CCE906F4361E8DD3143,"  By Wayne Noir - RION magazine. London's fashion landscape is about to feel a seismic shift. After a hiatus from the live runway, designer Joshua Kane is poised to make a thunderous return with Bespoken Dream—a new immersive show premiering July 16 at The Mandrake Hotel. Known for blurring the line between fashion and theatre, Kane's work doesn't merely drape the body—it commands it, turning silhouettes into storylines, buttons into punctuation marks, and seams into symphonic verses. For those unfamiliar with the name (though rare in the world of bespoke), Joshua Kane is far from a conventional tailor. Born in Oxfordshire in 1984, Kane's early years saw him toggling between semi-professional football and sketching designs  in his bedroom. He later enrolled at Kingston University, graduating with a First in Fashion Design, before cutting his teeth at Brooks Brothers in New York, Burberry Prorsum under Christopher Bailey, and ultimately as Senior Designer at Paul Smith. But Kane always had his eyes set on creating his own world—one in which craftsmanship collided unapologetically with performance. That world came to life in 2014, when Kane founded his namesake label out of his London flat. Within months, his Savile Row-level precision and Edwardian-inflected suiting were walking their own runway at London Collections Men. Soon after, a pop-up in Spitalfields gave way to a flagship on Great Portland Street, then evolved into a private showroom nestled inside a Marylebone townhouse. His studio quickly became more than a space for fittings—it became a stage. Unlike most designers, Kane doesn't believe in traditional fashion shows. “I never wanted to do a normal catwalk,” he once told Brummell Magazine. And he meant it. Each of his past showcases—be it the cinematic rush of Journey at the London Palladium, or the surreal drama of 2023's Shipwrecked Tailors—have drawn comparisons to West End productions. With choreographed movement, live musical scoring, and a cast of dancers, actors, and models, these events blur the boundaries of narrative, couture, and set design. And while the clothes are always the centerpiece, they exist within a living, breathing universe. But Kane's vision extends beyond the physical. In 2023, he dove headlong into the digital realm, designing garments for avatars and metaverse identities, minting NFTs, and testing the limits of digital tailoring—proving once again that tradition, in his hands, is no anchor. Now, with Bespoken Dream, Kane's myth-making reaches new heights. Details remain tightly under wraps, but early hints suggest the show will be his most intricate yet—a celebration of fine tailoring and fantasy told through an all-sensory spectacle. Set within the lush, dimly-lit corridors of The Mandrake, it promises couture not just worn, but performed. His fabric, famously woven exclusively in the UK, will be center stage. Each thread, each trim, painstakingly custom—an anthem of Kane's commitment to heritage and rebellion in equal measure. The show also coincides with a series of public studio events later this year—rare open hours where clients and collectors alike can glimpse the inner workings of Kane's atelier, perhaps even catch him mid-drape or deep in discussion with his creative team. That proximity is rare in a fashion world often hidden behind PR gates, but then again, Kane has always done things differently. Among those who've worn his designs: Rod Stewart, Jack Whitehall, Jason Momoa, and Tom Holland. His garments have graced the small screen via Bridgerton, She-Hulk, and Frontier. Yet for Kane, the celebrity name-drop has always taken a back seat to craftsmanship. “My goal was never to be famous,” he once said. “It was to make clothes that speak for themselves.” And speak they do. Whether standing still on a mannequin or flying down a runway surrounded by fog and violins, a Joshua Kane piece is unmistakable. This is fashion that doesn't whisper. It narrates. It dreams. And come July 16, it returns—with a vengeance. Joshuakanebespoke.com","By Wayne Noir - RION magazine. London's fashion landscape is about to feel a seismic shift.
