Bezos ficou noivo de Sánchez em 2023, quatro anos após o fim de seu casamento de 25 anos com a romancista e filantropa MacKenzie Scott. As festividades duraram três dias. Bill Gates, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Tom Brady, a rainha Rania da Jordânia, Oprah Winfrey, Kris Jenner e Kim e Khloé Kardashian, assim como Ivanka Trump e Jared Kushner, estavam entre as celebridades presentes. “Com cartazes sem espaço para Bezos”, moradores de Veneza protestaram contra a ocupação da cidade com o o turismo em massa. Alegaram que o crescimento explosivo do turismo está tornando a cidade inabitável e dos riscos das mudanças climáticas. Em Paris, o Museu do Louvre fechou as portas por um dia, contra o descontrole do turismo. O prefeito de Veneza defende o turismo e diz que os “visitantes” são mais venezianos do que os manifestantes. Esse tipo de protesto cresce na Europa. As núpcias de Bezos caracterizaram verdadeiro “casamento de fadas”, com custos estimados em US$ 56 milhões, segundo a Reuters, mas não fará nem cócegas na sua fortuna, estimada em US$ 237 bilhões (R$ 1,3 trilhão). Esse valor corresponde em mais de 600 vezes o custo médio de um casamento nos EUA, que gira em torno de US$ 33.000.O bilionário doou quase US$ 3,6 milhões (R$ 19,8 milhões) a três organizações da cidade. Na cerimônia, a noiva estava com um vestido de gola alta e um véu de tule e renda da Dolce & Gabbana, usado por Sophia Loren para se casar com Cary Grant no filme Houseboat, de 1958. Nas outras comemorações do casamento, ela usou os seus costumeiros decotes, com fenda lateral, ousados e profundos, que já chamou a atenção de Mark Zuckerberg, 41, magnata e empresário norte-americano. O jornal britânico “The Guardian” anotou algumas curiosidades sobre o casamento de Bezos. A soma dos patrimônios dos convidados foi estimada em US$ 435 bilhões. O preço médio de um quarto dos hotéis reservados pelo casal para os convidados é de US$ 2.000 por noite (R$ 11.000). Isso representa cerca de US$ 900.000 (R$ 4,95 milhões) para três noites, considerando aproximadamente 150 quartos reservados. O buffet foi assinado pelo chef Fabrício Mellino, do restaurante Quattro Passi, com três estrelas Michelin, localizado em Nerano, perto de Nápoles. O preço é de cerca de US$ 1.800 (R$ 9.900) por pessoa, para esse tipo de serviço. O restaurante ficou fechado por quatro dias e o custo da contratação totalizou cerca de US$ 1,1 milhão (R$ 6,05 milhões). Além disso, o casal presenteou cada convidado com uma caixa de produtos e doces locais, incluindo taças e copos de cores vibrantes da Laguna~B, especialista em vidro de Murano, feitos a mão. Realmente, um casamento extravagante! Hoje na história: Nascimento da filantropa britânica Diana Spencer, a princesa de Gales (60 anos).

Essence's Drop of Sunshine Bronzing Drops — this sheer, buildable formula is a perf $6 alternative to Drunk Elephant's version that goes for a whopping $39! Not only will this stuff leave you with a perfect sun-kissed glow, but it also contains glycerin to hydrate the skin barrier and vitamin E to soften the skin and smooth texture! Promising review: ""I love this so I ordered a second for backup! Depending on my day, I will add no more than one or two drops to my moisturizer or my primer. Takes away the winter pallor of my face, which definitely has not had enough sun lately. The bottle is small, but you don't need to use much. Reasonably priced for the amount. I would say buy it."" —Incognito Get it from Amazon for $5.99. 2. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder to instantly matte-ify your skin while helping it maintain its natural glow thanks to the blue hyaluronic acid. It even comes in a mess-free, travel-friendly case so you can take it on the go. That's a major upgrade to your routine, if I do say so myself. Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""I loved this setting powder, it blurred my pores and blended my makeup so well that even my husband noticed. Wow! I will be buying more before people find it and sell it all out, hehehe."" —Charlotte Laim Get it from Amazon for $25. 3.

It's compact enough to pop in your bag and take with you when you're traveling. This vegan, cruelty-free formula is free from parabens, fragrance, phthalates, alcohol, oil, preservatives, paraffin, and talc. Promising review: ""Does exactly what it says. Removes shine and gives a soft-focus effect to the makeup. Perfect for when you've been busy and your makeup is a little shiny in places. Doesn't change the color or texture of the makeup either or risk spilling or cracking like powder. A+"" —TheWildSide Get it from Amazon for $8. 4.

It comes with one bottle of hair identifier spray and four razors! Promising review: ""The power of the hair identifier's spray is unmatched. Once you spray in any direction that has hair, it automatically identifies the hair that needs to be removed. It is easily sprayed on and easily wiped off. No extra residue.

This is about to prevent SO many ""babe, stop leaving your peanut butter spoon on the counter"" arguments.

Here's a few of the many things I use this dishwasher-safe beauty for — and yep, it makes it into basically every dishwasher load, I use it THAT frequently. - Scraping every last bit of sauce, curry, salad dressing, or soup out of takeout or leftover containers, like in the picture above. This happens several times a week. I want every bit of all that flavor!! - Measuring out a few teaspoons of water when re-steaming takeout rice in the microwave. - Scraping out yogurt, hummus, salsa, hot sauce, peanut butter, expensive Bonne Maman jams, etc., etc., when I'm down to the last little bit of each. (It's too big for most beauty products, but that's fine.) - Mixing together a quick stir-fry sauce in a measuring cup, then scraping that sauce out of the cup into the pan, all with a single utensil. - Scrambling together a mixture of eggs and whatever else I want in a bowl and scraping all of that into a pan. - Scooping pancake batter my MIL sent over into a pan to make my 9-month-old fresh pancakes, including scraping the last bits out to get as much pancake as possible. Like, I know I functioned in the kitchen before I had this, but this saves me so much time scraping over and over with a spoon. And that price! A no-brainer.

mov_F6CC68ADAE8559C3EE972E8EFE74F497,"  From a filler-free body oil to an SPF you can apply over your makeup, these affordable faves are about to earn lifelong residency in your routine. 1. Peach Slices Redness Relief Color Correcting Cream for those days when your skin seems to be pitching a fit about something or another. This not only provides soothing, moisturizing ingredients like aloe and green algae, but it also has a subtle color-correcting tint that tones down redness. Think of it as a little tube of damage control for when your skin needs extra TLC. Promising review: ""I'm not one to normally leave reviews, but this is worth it. I've literally had this product for two days. I have severe rosacea on my nose. It's so bad I usually have to wear foundation to hide it because it's so noticeable. I've tried numerous products and serums with no luck, and honestly, I didn't expect this one to be any different. However, after only two days (probably applying it 4–5 times), almost all of the redness is gone! I'm in disbelief at the wonders it has done. I will without a doubt be stocking up on this product!"" —Tiffany Price: $19.88 2. Neutrogena Collagen Bank Facial Moisturizer that's basically an investment in your future face. Collagen helps keep things pinchably plump, bouncy, and glowy, which is great. But the real power player in this cream is the bakuchiol — an active ingredient which can boost cell turnover and smooth skin texture — which is basically retinol's less dramatic cousin. No joke, this study suggests that bakuchiol is just as effective as retinol while being way less likely to cause irritation. So basically, you get all the glow with none of the drama. It's a win-win. Promising review: ""The Neutrogena Collagen Bank moisturizer is making my skin feel smoother. It does not irritate my skin, and I really like the dispenser. I plan to keep using it."" —Serendipity Price: $19.97 (originally $22.97) 3. Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream because your skincare routine doesn't stop at your neck. It smells like summer vacation in a tub — think vanilla, salted caramel, and pistachio — and the fast-absorbing formula is infused with caffeine-rich guarana extract to visibly smooth and tighten. Your group chat will be demanding a scent rundown. Promising review: ""My skin is usually sensitive to anything with fragrances, this on the other hand, is perfect. It leaves my skin soft, and the fragrance ISN'T overpowering like other products. I would say over the span of a week or so I noticed a drastic improvement in my skin!"" —anonymous Price: $19.99+ (available in two sizes) 4. Aquaphor Lip Repair Ointment to rescue your lips when they feel like they've survived a beating. With a powerhouse blend of shea butter, beeswax, vitamin E, and chamomile, this ultra-soothing balm helps restore moisture, calms irritation, and keeps flakes at bay. Stop peeling and start slathering. Promising review: ""This product is highly recommended for maintaining moisture or replenishing moisture to chapped lips. I have sold lip conditioners that were 20 bucks. No need to pay that much money. Use this!"" —Tina Price: $8.36 for two 5. Or NYX Professional Makeup Fat Oil for a hydration boost that also gives your lips a juicy shine. With lots of moisturizing and antioxidant-rich ingredients, this lip oil is protective, long-lasting, and nonsticky.

João 15v12. 6-E amar o seu irmão não é dar-lhe coisas ou dinheiro, mas perdoar os seus pecados. 7-E assim, todo aquele que diz que te ama porque te dá coisas ou dinheiro. 8-Mas quando você peca contra ele, ele não perdoa seus pecados, ele mente, ele não te ama, porque amar significa perdoar. 9-E há muitos de nós que dizemos que amamos nossos irmãos porque lhes damos coisas ou dinheiro. 10-Mas mentimos porque quando eles pecam contra nós, não perdoamos seus pecados. 11-Portanto, quando Cristo vier, o perdão será exigido de todos os homens. Mateus 6:14-15. 13-Porque ninguém nesta terra que pode fazer todas as coisas boas em uma pessoa, aquele que pode fazer todas as coisas boas em uma pessoa é Deus Pai somente. 14-Porque se você fizer essas coisas boas para seu irmão, sempre permanecerão as outras coisas boas que você não pode fazer por ele que ele faz em si mesmo e que os outros homens fazem por ele. 15-Portanto, quem quiser escapar da ira de Deus deve perdoar os homens suas ofensas.

788194AC4F6EE38BAA09391FD01E85A6,"  In a 49-page lawsuit filed in California, Lululemon accused the retail wholesaler of selling knockoff versions of its Scuba clothing and popular ABC men's pants. For nearly as long as mankind has worn fancy things, someone out there has been trying to copy those things. Ancient artisans cribbed from each other's designs. Victorian hustlers duped diamond jewelry with shimmery paste. Christian Dior, the godfather of high fashion himself, was believed to sell his own designs to lesser known producers, who could make cheaper versions. For the modern athleisure giant Lululemon, however, the duping has gone too far. In a lawsuit filed in California on June 25, the company accused the wholesale retailer Costco of selling knockoff sweatshirts, jackets and other activewear at a fraction of what Lululemon charges. Successfully suing over knockoffs is notoriously difficult for fashion brands and designers, in part because copyright laws are often vague, experts say. Lululemon's case seeks restitution and payment from Costco, which it said profited off Lululemon's ''sweat equity'' and damaged the Lululemon brand. Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. What is Lululemon accusing Costco of doing? Lululemon said Costco is selling knockoffs of its Scuba hoodies and sweatshirts, Define jackets and popular ABC pants for men. Using design images and side-by-side comparisons, Lululemon, in a 49-page court filing, argued that Costco sold jackets and hoodies -- made by clothing manufacturers such as Danskin, Spyder and Jockey -- using terms in its marketing similar to what Lululemon uses. In one instance cited in the lawsuit, Costco sold a turquoise Danskin-made pullover -- which at a glance looks remarkably similar to Lululemon's Scuba sweatshirt -- with the color ''Tidewater Teal.'' It's the same way Lululemon describes the color of its own teal sweatshirts. Lululemon also accuses Costco of manufacturing a knockoff of its ABC pants -- which retail for about $130 -- under Costco's own brand, Kirkland, and selling them for $20. Contracts between vendors like Danskin and Jockey and retailers like Costco often include provisions like indemnification clauses, which can specify that vendors bear financial responsibility for legal issues that could arise from their products. It's unclear whether such clauses exist in this case. How has Lululemon dealt with dupes? Lululemon, with its unadorned styles and high prices, is famously a target for knockoffs. Hashtags on TikTok direct shoppers to cheap, duped versions of the brand's leggings and athletic wear. Since Lululemon's inception in Canada in 1998, fashion law experts in America say that the brand has been on the forefront of design trademark law, which is famously lax in the United States as compared to other markets, like Europe. ''They absolutely have been on the forefront of trying to find ways to protect their intellectual property,'' said Susan Scafidi, the founder and director of the Fashion Law Institute at the Fordham School of Law. Protecting trademarks, logos and labels is one thing. Protecting the design of a garment is another.'' ''In Europe that's easy. Design rights, done,'' said Ms. Scafidi. '' In the U.S., well in Lululemon terms, they have to warm up and stretch.'' Still, dupes are enough of a concern that Lululemon held several ''dupe'' exchanges in 2023, offering holders of confirmed ''dupe'' leggings to bring their clothes to designated sites and trade them for the real thing. At the time, Nikki Neuburger, Lululemon's chief branding officer, said it was an effort to acknowledge ''dupes'' as part of fashion while protecting the original producer. ''We saw it as a really fun way to play into something that is a real part of our culture, but in a way that really puts the focus back on the original,'' Ms. Neuburger told CNN. What is 'dupe' culture? Many millennials probably recall a school or family trip to New York City in the 2000s, when a coveted status symbol of adolescence was a pair of sunglasses or a candy-colored knockoff designer purse, bought after haggling with a vendor on Canal Street. But today's dupe market has gone digital, and TikTok has become a prime platform. Videos with the ''dupe'' hashtag have billions of views on the platform. For many in Gen Z, good dupes have become almost as coveted as originals. Many influencers promote knockoffs of Stanley mugs, Lululemon pants, sneakers and designer jewelry. ''Dupes are not only out there in the open, they are a point of pride. These are the modern versions of being an extreme coupon clipper or a bargain hunter, and it has lost a lot of its shame,'' Ms. Scafidi said. But designers are increasingly trying to stamp out knockoffs, and take back brands' power. In November 2024, Sol de Janeiro sued over dupes of its popular scented mist sprays. The year before that, Deckers, which owns the Ugg boot brand, sued over dupes of its ankle shearling boot. This May, Deckers sued Costco over the same thing, claiming the retailer's far cheaper Shearling slippers were a direct copy of the UGG equivalent. If the Lululemon suit succeeds, Ms. Scafidi said, it could rewind some of that clock, making original designer versions once again palatable. ''Lulu is trying to buy back some of that territory,'' Ms. Scafidi said. If they win, ''that will be a huge social victory.''","In a 49-page lawsuit filed in California, Lululemon accused the retail wholesaler of selling knockoff versions of its Scuba clothing and popular ABC men's pants.

A powerful call to defend hard-won rights under threat: over 90 legal rollbacks in the past three years, 62 countries still criminalize homosexuality, and marriage equality is recognized in only 38. The project, which honors those who ignited the fight for LGBTQ+ rights, was made possible through a collaboration with the production company Dim Sum and the support of organizations including Redi, Fundación 26 de Diciembre, Yaaj, Colectivo Sol, Colombia Diversa, Movilh, and Grand Rapids Pride, all of whom contributed to the research process. MADRID, July 02, 2025     Over the past three years, more than 90 legislative changes across different countries have rolled back essential rights for the LGBTQ+ community, reversing decades of hard-fought progress. Equally alarming: homosexuality is still criminalized in 62 countries, and marriage equality is officially recognized in just 38. In the face of this global backlash, listening to those who've fought this battle before has never been more urgent. In response, LLYC, the global Marketing and Corporate Affairs firm, is launching , a campaign that rekindles the original protest banners of the first Pride marches, returning them to the streets in 2025. Created in partnership with Dim Sum and with the backing of LGBTQ+ organizations from five countries, the campaign is a tribute to the roots of queer activism — at a time when past victories are once again under threat. shines a spotlight on senior LGBTQ+ activists — key figures from the earliest Pride protests — who re-emerge today as living symbols of memory, courage, and resistance. Their stories don't just honor history, they inspire action in the present and strengthen the collective will to protect the future. The initiative brings historic protest banners back into the spotlight in Pride marches this 2025, in cities such as Bogotá, Mexico City, Madrid, and Santiago de Chile. This was made possible through close collaboration with frontline LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations, including Redi, Fundación 26 de Diciembre, Yaaj, Colectivo Sol, Colombia Diversa, Movilh, and Grand Rapids Pride, who supported LLYC throughout the research and development process. At the heart of the campaign is a powerful short film featuring Ramón Linaza, a senior Spanish activist who revisits the early days of Pride. Through his story, we journey across decades of progress and confront the urgent challenges the community faces today. His voice is joined by nearly a dozen conversations with other senior activists from around the world— a multigenerational chorus that weaves together past and present, and reminds us why these signs of Pride still matter. The project's web experience allows viewers to dive deeper into each story: Who were the original banner holders? What was the world like when they first marched? And how do they see themselves reflected in today's struggles? Through a visual and emotional journey, the campaign presents then-and-now portraits taken in the same locations as the original photos with the same banners, either carefully restored or faithfully recreated by hand, to show that their messages still hold true.

mov_506F60092041276BDB4E49603CC4BA42,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]GB Edições 02/07/2025 - Cada vez mais pessoas têm optado por viajar sozinhas, aproveitando a oportunidade para se reconectar consigo mesmas e desfrutar da própria companhia. Nesta matéria, apresentamos cinco destinos especialmente indicados para quem quer viver essa experiência de forma independente, explorando novos lugares no seu próprio ritmo. As opções vão desde retiros de bem-estar e passeios por ilhas paradisíacas até mergulhos com snorkel e viagens urbanas repletas de cultura e história. Uma viagem urbana por Liverpool, no Reino Unido, é uma opção a ser considerada. Liverpool é um destino muito recomendado por viajantes devido aos seus simpáticos habitantes. Conhecida pelos Beatles, pelo estádio de futebol Anfield e pelo rio Mersey, essa cidade animada está cheia de “scousers” (como são chamados os moradores locais) acolhedores e oferece atividades interessantes – um ambiente perfeito para viajantes individuais. É possível visitar o vibrante Cavern Club, um antigo bar de jazz que se tornou o berço da música pop britânica e, para ter uma visão dos bastidores do Abbey Road Studios e fazer uma viagem no Yellow Submarine, uma dica é visitar a exibição “The Beatles Story”, dedicada à famosa banda de rock. O programa de revitalização urbana em andamento e a orla renovada da cidade estão transformando seu antigo centro em um dos destinos mais agradáveis e adaptados para ciclistas no Norte da Inglaterra. O viajante pode pedalar pelos parques e mergulhar na herança cultural da cidade, que inclui seus muitos edifícios tombados e duas grandes catedrais, a antiga e a nova. Um passeio pelo Georgian Quarter apresenta uma amostra bem preservada do passado, com suas belas casas geminadas e ruas charmosas repletas de pubs históricos. Outra opção é a região industrial-chique Baltic Triangle, que possui excelentes tavernas de cerveja artesanal e é outro ótimo lugar para conversar com os moradores locais. Se você é mais aventureiro, um mergulho com snorkel, em Ko Ngai, na Tailândia pode ser uma boa opção. Com praias de areia branca, águas cristalinas e palmeiras, o Ko Ngai é um destino ao longo da costa Sul de Andaman, onde viajantes solo descobrirão um fascinante mundo subaquático com vida marinha tropical. Rodeada por corais, essa pequena ilha densamente arborizada faz parte do Parque Nacional de Koh Lanta. O local é um paraíso secreto para quem quer curtir a praia na própria companhia, enquanto relaxa em uma rede e aproveita a água. Os recifes de coral ao longo da costa da ilha são um lugar perfeito para praticar mergulho com snorkel ou cilindro e observar as diferentes espécies de peixes. Outras atividades famosas oferecidas na região incluem caiaque e stand-up paddle. Nesse destino fora dos circuitos habituais, onde não há estradas ou grandes lojas por perto, é possível desfrutar de passeios em um barco e conhecer as ilhas vizinhas de Koh Mook, com sua famosa Caverna Esmeralda, e Koh Kradan, com outros recifes de coral. Com muitos viajantes brasileiros indicando que querem ter tempo para relaxar durante as férias, encontrar um refúgio relaxante para a mente e o corpo é uma ótima maneira de fazer uma viagem solo. Muito recomendada por viajantes da agência online Booking.com para a prática de ioga, Bad Füssing, na Alemanha, é uma cidade termal famosa no distrito de Passau, na Baviera. É o lugar perfeito para as pessoas que viajam sozinhas em busca de uma pausa de bem-estar e relaxamento profundo em um ambiente idílico. É possível escolher entre uma ampla seleção de aulas de ioga e retiros disponíveis, incluindo práticas de yin e vinyasa, em níveis que vão do iniciante ao avançado. Uma dica é mergulhar os músculos nos banhos termais curativos pelos quais essa cidade é famosa e aproveitar os benefícios para a saúde que a água mineral quente proporciona. Ou, ainda, mexer o corpo durante um passeio a pé ao longo do rio Inn, em Passau, que percorre as vielas históricas da cidade romana de Passau, situada a um curto trajeto de carro e aproveitar para explorar suas duas pontes, a Catedral de Santo Estêvão, de estilo barroco, e o antigo Palácio do Bispo. Para quem gosta de natureza, não há lugar melhor para viajar sozinho do que em meio a colinas e morros cheios de belezas naturais, em Búzios, que está situada em uma península oceânica a Leste do Rio de Janeiro. Esse balneário chique é repleto de boutiques, restaurantes elegantes e pousadas de luxo. Além disso, é muito recomendado por causa da natureza. Existem inúmeras maneiras de se conectar: o viajante pode fazer um passeio tranquilo ao longo do calçadão de madeira em direção à Praia de João Fernandes, apreciando as casas coloridas e estátuas de bronze de figuras históricas. Ao fim da caminhada, uma boa pedida é aproveitar para nadar nas três pequenas enseadas e também é possível fazer um passeio de barco em Búzios pelas águas azul-turquesa ao redor da península. Atividades cheias de adrenalina, como trekking e mergulho com cilindro, são bastante procuradas e revelam a singularidade da fauna e flora da região. Há muitas maneiras para conhecer uma ilha. No entanto, para quem quer visitar mais de um destino e conhecer diferentes culturas, tradições e culinárias, fazer um passeio que inclui a visita a diversas ilhas é uma excelente maneira de explorar mais em uma jornada solo. As remotas Yaeyama Islands, no Japão, são um paraíso escondido a Sudoeste de Okinawa. Elas são famosas devido às suas lindas praias, pôr do sol e paisagens de cana-de-açúcar em tons de verde-claro. Com algumas das melhores selvas subtropicais e manguezais do país, as ilhas também oferecem o melhor mergulho com snorkel e cilindro do Japão. Outra característica das Yaeyama Islands é a facilidade com que é possível explorá-las para descobrir sua diversidade. Serviços de balsa frequentes circulam entre a cidade de Ishigajo e as ilhas próximas, permitindo ao viajante visitar três ou quatro em uma viagem. Recomenda-se usar a ilha de Kohama como base e desfrutar de passeios do tipo “bate e volta” para as ilhas vizinhas de Taketomi e Ishigaki. Se você está planejando tirar férias na melhor companhia que existe – a sua própria –, aproveite estas sugestões. Escolha o destino que mais combina com o seu estilo e entre em contato com seu agente de viagens para transformar esse plano em realidade. .","SPR_COMBO[pt]GB Edições 02/07/2025 - Cada vez mais pessoas têm optado por viajar sozinhas, aproveitando a oportunidade para se reconectar consigo mesmas e desfrutar da própria companhia.

While I'm not saying I'm proud of it, I've never been a religious sunscreen user. While I do stay indoors most of the time (bring on the gloomy fall weather, please!) , sunscreen is a key step in my skincare routine when I'm going to be in the sun—especially during vacation. The last sunburn I got in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, stained my back for months, so lesson learned. Given that I've never been a diehard sunscreen enthusiast, I've never had a solid favorite. I recently got into the Sol de Janeiro Rio Radiance Body Spray SPF 50 because it has such a unique summer scent of Cheirosa '97, and it applies effortlessly. Of course, I've used the viral Vacation Sunscreen Classic Whip SPF 30 because what kind of beauty writer would I be otherwise? But when it comes to the face, it wasn't until my first Candela Matrix Pro radiofrequency microneedling treatment that I found my go-to sunscreen. The team at Candela sent me off with a goodie bag filled with post-microneedling care must-haves: Cetaphil Daily Oil-Free Hydrating Lotion and my new go-to SPF, La Roche-Posay's Anthelios Sunscreen-Gentle Lotion. La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen-Gentle Lotion “Mineral sunscreens like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen-Gentle Lotion have zinc or titanium dioxide, which are active mineral ingredients that protect the skin from UV rays,” explains Beauty Villa Vergara founder Dr. Mariana Vergara, who performed the three-session radiofrequency microneedling treatment on me. “They sit on the top of the skin and reflect the UV radiation, acting like a physical barrier. These types of sunscreens are recommended for sensitive skin or for its use after treatments like microneedling radiofrequency.” Buy At Dermstore$26 Buy At Amazon$26 Free Returns | Free Shipping Aside from being post-procedure-approved, Vergara says that this affordable sunscreen, which targets both UVA and UVB rays, is an especially solid option for users with oily skin, thanks to the inclusion of lipo hydroxy acid, which can help keep breakouts and shine at bay. “[Lipo Hydroxy Acid] is a derivative of salicylic acid, and it can renew oily skin,” she says. “It also contains vitamin E, which is a great antioxidant that helps neutralize free radicals,” she says. Given Vergara's approval, along with hundreds of glowing reviews from Amazon shoppers, I knew I had a winner in my hands—and after using it consistently for a few weeks, I understand the hype. Not only did it protect my skin from the sun post-treatment (when the skin is extra sensitive to light), but my makeup went on extremely smoothly over the SPF—and it stayed in place for hours. I've gone on to take it with me everywhere, but the product was really put to the test on my birthday when I stayed at the stunning Casa Del Mar in sunny Santa Monica. I slathered on the SPF from head to toe and spent the day lounging by the pool, with an early evening seaside stroll on the sand before dinner. Despite the hot temps, I piled my makeup on strong over the gentle sunscreen. To my surprise, the SPF helped keep my makeup looking smooth and velvety (no excess shine!) throughout the day, and I was left with not a burn in sight. Three months after regular use, I've decided that not only does the non-greasy SPF protect my face and body, but it truly does serve as a remarkable makeup primer as well, which is one less product I have to pack with me when I travel. I may not use this SPF every single day, but when I do reach for a sunscreen, La Roche-Posay's Anthelios Sunscreen-Gentle Lotion is the one I grab.

La protesta es encabezada por comisarios, delegados y transportistas de localidades como La Calera, Las Marías, Puente de Fierro, Pablo Galeana, Xolapa y El Playón. Daniel Rosas Martínez, coordinador de comisariados y representante de Xaltianguis, explicó que una de las demandas centrales es la reconstrucción del Hospital Básico Comunitario de esa localidad, que permanece inoperante y con daños estructurales desde antes del paso de los huracanes Otis y John. “Hoy no tenemos rayos X, quirófano, sala de partos ni ambulancia.

Blame it on the huge selection, speedy shipping, and simple return process, but let's just say I put my Prime account to good use—especially when it comes to beauty products. Whether it's a TikTok-viral lip stain or a cult-classic Korean essence, I've placed more orders in the last year than I'd like to admit. At the time, it was bad news for my bank account, but now, it's good news for you because I know which Amazon beauty products are actually worth ordering, and right in time for Prime Day, too. This year, Prime Day deals are happening from July 8 to 11. During the sale, Prime members can score big discounts on thousands of products, including the best of the beauty category. Excited? Me too. Keep scrolling to see my official, beauty editor–approved shopping guide. Wonderskin Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain - Adore I have to start with a product I use almost every single day—Wonderskin's Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain. It went viral on TikTok a few months ago, and once I tested it, I could see why. Apply the dark-blue liquid to the lips (don't worry—it doesn't stay that way), wait a few minutes to let it dry, and peel it off. You'll be left with the most stunning, long-lasting lip color. You can stop there, or you can apply lip gloss over the top. I prefer the latter. It's become my go-to lip combo. Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water I can't tell you how many makeup artists and skincare experts have recommended Bioderma's Sensibio H2O Micellar Water to me. The classic French pharmacy product quickly and easily dissolves makeup, cleansing the skin without leaving behind even a hint of redness or irritation. Bondi Sands Self Tanning Foam Behold! The only self-tanner I've used consistently for over five years—Bondi Sands' Self Tanning Foam in Dark. It doesn't streak. It doesn't smell. It also features a bronze guide color, allowing you to see exactly where you're placing it and where you need to blend. I wear it overnight, and by the next morning, I have natural-looking, sun-kissed limbs. COLOR WOW Dream Coat Supernatural Spray I've always wondered how celebrities like Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian get such glossy hair on the red carpet. Well, as it turns out, the answer is Color Wow's Dream Coat Supernatural Spray. Read my full review to learn why it's such an underrated gem. COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence Snail mucin is the ultimate glass-skin ingredient. It's moisturizing, antioxidant-rich, and anti-inflammatory, so no wonder this iconic snail mucin essence blew up on the internet. It's the key to firm, bouncy, dewy skin. Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey Clinique's Almost Lipstick in Black Honey is so good. It was *the* lipstick for '90s starlets and supermodels. Everyone from Drew Barrymore to Courteney Cox and Julia Roberts wore it in the decade of slip dresses, grunge music, and mood rings. Cut to modern day, and it's still as beloved as ever. It recently had a resurgence on TikTokafter Gen Z became aware of its sheer formula and unique and universally flattering raisin-esque color. divi Scalp Serum...","Kaitlyn McLintock wearing Wonderskin's Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain I love shopping on Amazon.

mov_27D5CAF6F05A62CD128CE9E1F5F3E24C,"  The sales on these beloved products could be gone before Prime Day is even over. Amazon Prime Day deals are here for four days this year, but that doesn't mean all your favorite products will be on sale for that full length of time. Popular products tend to sell out quickly when the discounts are this deep, so if you've had your eye on something, you don't want to miss your chance to grab it on sale. Below, we tracked down some of the most beloved products that are on sale right now — and all of these have historically sold out quickly. If you spot something on this list that you've been waiting to add to your cart, wait no more. A deal this good may not come around again for a while. Prices change quickly on Prime Day, so keep checking back to see the latest updates. Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. Stasher 10-piece reusable silicone storage bag set (40% off list price) Stasher's popular reusable storage bags can help you cut down on plastic waste (as well as the cost of buying single-use plastic bags), and we don't expect them to last long on the shelves. This 10-pack comes with bags in six different sizes, as well as four stretch lids. All are made with silicone and are safe for use in the dishwasher, freezer, microwave and oven. The TikTok-viral Meridian body hair trimmer (40% off list price) Rarely on sale for a price this low, this Meridian body hair trimmer is a viral product that may see a ton of orders this Prime Day (plenty of reviews mention first seeing it on TikTok). The trimmer can be used by both men and women, is 100% waterproof and promises a close shave without irritation, redness, ingrown hair, razor burn or bumps. It's cordless and rechargeable, and comes with an anti-nick guard to keep you safe. Cabeau TNE travel neck pillow (25% off list price) You might be familiar with Cabeau's popular neck pillows, and their TNE memory foam pillow will be on sale for Prime Day. Available in a bunch of different colors, this pillow is a must-have for flights, long train or car rides and more: It has seat straps you can attach to your chair to keep your head and neck in alignment, prevents your head from falling forward with ""head catch"" technology and is made with ergonomic memory foam. It also comes with a travel bag you can attach to your luggage. A bestselling absorbent and slip-resistant bath mat (50% off list price) An already affordable product just got an even better price. Gorilla Grip reports that their popular bath mat — which has 4.3 stars across more than 76,000 ratings — sold over 10,000 units in the past month alone, so with this half-off discount, we're expecting shoppers to flock here. Made with cozy, plush chenille, the absorbent bath mat has a textured rubber backing and is slip- and fade-resistant. It comes in so many sizes and colors, so you can match your bathroom's style and needs easily. Anua niacinamide 10 + TXA 4 serum (30% off list price) With the ongoing tariff situation potentially affecting the prices of Korean skin care and beauty products, as well as K-beauty's general popularity during Prime Day, we could see products like this Anua serum selling out. The brand reports that more than 40,000 units of the serum were bought in just the last month, too. Suitable for all skin types, the fragrance-free serum contains 10% niacinamide, as well as other skin-boosting ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramide to help your skin glow and provide hydration. The texture is described as lightweight and non-greasy, making this an easy add to any skin care routine. Lumineux teeth whitening strips (33% off list price) Yes, the ever-popular Crest 3D Whitestrips will be on sale for Prime Day (they appear elsewhere on this list), but we could also see this Lumineux alternative selling out too — it's garnered over 56,000 ratings with a 4.1-star average. These also come dentist-recommended for patients with sensitive teeth. The strips are enamel-safe and peroxide-free, relying on natural ingredients like coconut oil, lemon peel oil and more. Sol de Janeiro hair and body perfume mist (20% off list price) A constant Amazon beauty bestseller, we pretty much never see this Sol de Janeiro perfume mist on sale, so be prepared to grab it while you can. The mist comes in a ton of different scents, though the beachy, summer-ready Cheirosa '62 is probably the most well-known (it matches the viral Brazilian Bum Bum Cream scent, which also appears on this list). You can get a bottle in two sizes, including one that's travel-friendly. Blueair's newest air purifier (20% off list price) This Prime Day is the first time ever that Blueair's newest air purifier, the Blue Signature, is on sale, so you'll want to jump on this deal while you can. The purifier boasts seven stages of filtration, odor-blocking technology and an air quality indicator. You can control it using the accompanying app to set a schedule and get alerts for when the filter needs replacing. The purifier can clean up to 3,385 square feet and can even double as a table to make it multifunctional. Cocokind ceramide barrier serum (25% off list price) Another offering from a popular skin care brand, Cocokind's ceramide barrier serum can help soothe and hydrate the skin barrier using squalane and beta-glucan, as well as five ceramides. According to the brand, these ingredients can offer more hydration than hyaluronic acid, and with a comfortable, lightweight feel, the serum can layer with retinol, vitamin C and other skin care products and instantly absorb into the skin. HexClad 6-piece nonstick fry pan set (20% off list price) You're probably familiar with HexClad, the Gordon Ramsay-approved cookware brand. We could see this 6-piece set going quickly with the offered discount: It contains fry pans of three sizes (8-, 10- and 12-inch) as well as lids for each. The hexagonal nonstick surface provides an even sear and is easy to clean, not to mention dishwasher- and oven-safe up to 400 degrees....","The sales on these beloved products could be gone before Prime Day is even over.

HexClad 6-piece nonstick fry pan set (20% off list price) You're probably familiar with HexClad, the Gordon Ramsay-approved cookware brand.

Deus tem os Seus propósitos e, mesmo quando hesitamos, Ele continua agindo — com ou sem nossa participação.

Às vezes, nos sentimos pequenos ou despreparados, mas Deus não erra em Suas colocações. Se você está em uma situação difícil ou desafiadora, lembre-se: você pode ser a resposta de Deus para esse tempo e esse lugar. ORAÇÂO Senhor Deus, Obrigada por me lembrar que Tu tens um propósito para cada estação da minha vida. Ajuda-me a não me calar diante daquilo que precisa ser feito. Dá-me coragem, sabedoria e fé para agir conforme a Tua vontade. Usa-me como instrumento de transformação no tempo e lugar em que me colocaste. Em nome de Jesus, amém.

Foi a segunda capital da Revolução Farroupilha, o que lhe confere um valor simbólico e patriótico forte na memória do estado. Esse passado está presente em construções como o Forte Dom Pedro II e no Museu Lanceiros do Sul, que guardam registros da luta dos farroupilhas. As celebrações da Semana Farroupilha são especialmente intensas na cidade, reunindo a população em torno de festas, desfiles, músicas e danças tradicionais que reforçam o orgulho da identidade sul-rio-grandense. Além de seu legado histórico, Caçapava do Sul se destaca por sua forte ligação com a natureza e o patrimônio geológico. A cidade é um dos polos brasileiros do geoturismo, com paisagens únicas como a Pedra do Segredo e o Cerro do Depósito, que encantam tanto turistas quanto estudiosos. Essa relação com a terra influencia também na cultura local, refletida em expressões artísticas, no modo de vida e até mesmo na culinária regional. A mistura de tradição, história e natureza faz de Caçapava do Sul um lugar onde a cultura gaúcha é vivida com autenticidade e orgulho.

Quem sabe se não foi para um momento como este que você chegou à posição de rainha? "" Ester 4:14 PENSAMENTO Mardoqueu lembra a Ester que o silêncio diante da injustiça não a salvaria. Deus tem os Seus propósitos e, mesmo quando hesitamos, Ele continua agindo — com ou sem nossa participação. Mas o convite de Deus é claro: ""Quem sabe se não foi para este tempo que você chegou até aqui?"" Esta é uma chamada para reconhecermos os momentos em que somos posicionados por Deus para fazer a diferença. Pode ser na nossa família, trabalho, igreja ou comunidade. Às vezes, nos sentimos pequenos ou despreparados, mas Deus não erra em Suas colocações. Se você está em uma situação difícil ou desafiadora, lembre-se: você pode ser a resposta de Deus para esse tempo e esse lugar. ORAÇÂO Senhor Deus, Obrigada por me lembrar que Tu tens um propósito para cada estação da minha vida. Ajuda-me a não me calar diante daquilo que precisa ser feito. Dá-me coragem, sabedoria e fé para agir conforme a Tua vontade. Usa-me como instrumento de transformação no tempo e lugar em que me colocaste. Em nome de Jesus, amém.

It comes with 44 strips total, which is enough for 20 regular treatments and two one-hour express treatments. Check out a TikTok of the Crest 3D Whitestrips in action. Promising review: ""I haven't used Crest White Strips in over five years. Since then, my teeth have stayed really white, and I frequently get compliments or questions about how I got my teeth so white. I decided to get a box to boost the whiteness of my teeth. Wow, I was shocked at how much these have improved! Before, the strips were really flimsy, hard to remove from the package, and really hard to keep on your teeth — the old ones would slip or bunch up. These are such an improvement! The new strips remove easily from the plastic they are on. The strips are REALLY adhesive! These will not budge! Since I've purchased, I have only used them about four times, and I can already notice a difference. Other people have noticed, too. I think these are well worth the money and work as well as a professional treatment. I have had friends who have done professional treatments and their teeth are not as white as mine.

Whether I need to restock my combination skincare routine or am looking to test a buzzy new beauty device, a great deal is always around the corner. Looks like it's true that good things come to those who wait—Amazon Prime Day is here just in time to refresh my summer beauty routine. From now through July 11, you can spot hundreds (if not thousands) of deals on Amazon in every major category, including summer shoes and vacation essentials. However, it's the sale of the year for beauty fans as top brands like Supergoop, Sol de Janeiro, Shark Beauty, Laneige, and so many more are at a major discount. To put it simply, Amazon Prime Day is not a sale you want to skip. To ensure you don't miss out on any of the incredible discounts, I'm bringing you the ultimate edit of Amazon Prime Day's best beauty deals. Ahead, uncover some of our editors' holy grail nail finds, skincare, fragrance, devices, makeup, and hair care currently on sale.

The Best Overall Beauty Deals at Amazon Prime Day Amazon Prime Day at a Glance Best Skincare Deals at Amazon Prime Day Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Spf 50 (Was $38) While technically this is a facial sunscreen, it doubles as a makeup primer that can be used anytime, anywhere. Katherine J. Igoe, an MC contributing editor, says, ""It goes on smoothly and feels incredibly lightweight without any of the annoyances of most sunscreens."" Katherine J. Igoe tests Supergoop! Unseen Sunscren SPF 50. (Image credit: MC Editors) Bioderma Bioderma Sensibio H2o Micellar Water (Was $14) Waterproof mascara, SPF, makeup, and dirt don't stand a chance with this French pharmacy favorite in your routine. A couple of drops on a cotton pad will remove your makeup, all while balancing pH, hydrating, and soothing skin. CeraVe Cerave Hydrating Cream to Foam Cleanser (Was $20) This cleanser is just what your skincare routine needs as a first step—it gently removes makeup and grime without drying out your skin. The cream lathers quickly into a foam, so a little bit goes a long way. Embryolisse Embryolisse Lait-Crème Concentré (Was $29) Another French beauty staple, this moisturizer will have your skin feeling baby soft and smooth in no time. It's a rich cream that deeply nourishes the skin, without feeling too heavy or leaving behind any greasiness. Kiehl's Avocado Eye Treatment (Was $38) This is one of the best eye creams for dryness, so it's not a bad idea to stock up before the fall. It uses avocado oil and caffeine to help smooth puffy eyes and fine lines and to boost radiance. Best Beauty Device Deals at Amazon Prime Day Shark Shark Hd430 Flexstyle Air Styling & Drying System (Was $350) As someone with minimal hair styling skills, the Shark FlexStyle is the only way I know how to do my hair. It's easy as can be to use, and I can create a variety of styles from big, bouncy curls to sleek blowouts. Brooke Knappenberger tests the auto-wrap curler attachments of the Shark FlexStyle.

mov_1143B5BDE1550C1E516D4F1F909C312F,"  Amazon Prime Day kicks off Tuesday, July 8, and what used to be a 24-hour shopping frenzy has now evolved into a nearly week-long sales event. However, this year, the real giant faces some economic headwinds. The Wall Street Journal reports that interest in Prime Day has waned in recent years, with year-over-year growth stuck in the single digits. Shoppers are also keeping a close eye on looming tariffs from the Trump administration, which could raise prices on everyday goods in the months ahead. What are customers buying? Analysts expect consumers to focus on deeper discounts now, especially on big-ticket items like TVs. Senior analyst Zam Stambor at eMarketer said customers are “very focused on getting value where and when they can right now.” One third-party seller told the Journal that while he expects strong momentum on Day 1, interest may taper off later in the week. Still, he believes sales will outpace a typical July day. BuzzFeed highlighted top deals on items such as Stanley Quenchers, Sol de Janeiro body cream, AirPods Pro, the Philips Sonicare toothbrush and the Nespresso Vertuo Plus coffee maker. Amazon leans on AI tools To boost the shopping experience, Amazon is promoting Rufus, its relatively new AI-powered product comparison tool available in the Amazon app. While it helps customers narrow down options, some users say it still struggles to interpret more complex questions. Amazon officials hope extending Prime Day will supercharge Amazon's revenues, which already bring in more than $50 billion annually. The sales event drives major ad spending from sellers looking to outshine competitors offering similar products. The CEO of Bartesian, a cocktail machine maker, says he will use Prime Day to build brand awareness ahead of the more competitive Black Friday season. He also warned that prices may rise later this year, depending on the impact of tariffs. Prime memberships and revenue expectations Amazon is also hoping to use the event to convert more shoppers into Prime members. Current membership costs $139 per year, which includes perks such as fast shipping and TV streaming offers. According to eMarketer, Amazon is projected to bring in a record $12.9 billion in the U.S. during Prime week — a jump of more than 50% compared to last year. This year's event follows spring campaigns like Pet Day, Book Day and the Summer Beauty Haul — all part of Amazon's effort to stretch its sales calendar year-round. Jason Morrell (Morning Managing Editor), Shianne DeLeon (Video Editor), and Devin Pavlou (Digital Producer) contributed to this report.","Amazon Prime Day kicks off Tuesday, July 8, and what used to be a 24-hour shopping frenzy has now evolved into a nearly week-long sales event.

Revlon's One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumiser has been a viral hit, racking up more than 40,000 reviews on Amazon. At £39.99 full price it's still a lot cheaper than getting hair blown out in a salon, however, thanks to an Amazon Prime Day deal it's currently even more of a bargain on sale for £28.39. Shoppers will need to be a member of Amazon Prime to take advantage of the offer and those that are not can sign up for a free 30-day trial here. This makes the Revlon blow-dry brush cheaper at Amazon than it currently is at Boots and Argos. The clever gadget is a savvy combination of a dryer and a styling brush, designed to speed up the process of styling hair while keeping damage at bay. With a ceramic coating and ionic technology, it promises a frizz-free, smooth mane for varying hair types. It also has three heat settings, two speed options and a 'cool shot' feature to set the style firmly in place.

Dyson's Airwrap and Shark's Flexstyle both carry a price tag upwards of £200, which is why Revlon's offering is seen as a steal by beauty fans applauding it as 'much better' than pricier options.

It's a much easier way to tan the body, ensuring less risk of streaks and patchy tan. The formula is also boosted with caffeine, baobab and oat extract to help make the skin appear firmer, brighter and smoother.

There are more deals than you could ever begin to look through on your own...so that's where we come in. We waded through the mountains of bargains for you and found some of the best deals in every category. FYI — deals move *fast*. We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. The 2nd Gen AirPods Pro for 40% off (that's $100 off, an all-new lowest price ever!) . With active noise cancellation, spatial audio, three silicone tips for customized fit, and over 24 hours of listening time with the included case, the AirPods Pro 2 give you a *ton* of bang for your buck. Promising review: ""Holy cow. Anyone with standard AirPods should upgrade to these on the next go-around, if not sooner. These are indeed a game changer! I can hear my books/music/podcasts on the train without adjusting the volume, and even while standing on the noisy platform when trains come through. The noise cancellation is amazing. I no longer cringe when seated next to noisy people first thing in the morning. The options for total noise cancellation vs. the adaptive settings are terrific. I had avoided this style previously because I found them uncomfortable compared to the original AirPods, but with the different offered attachments, it is much easier to find the comfortable option. Highly recommend the extra money for these!"" —Rosemary Price: $149 (originally $249 (and currently $249 at Apple); typically $189.99 at Amazon) AirPods 4 are also a new lowest price ever — 34% off with noise cancellation (down to $119), 31% off without (down to $89). 2. Select colors of 40-ounce Stanley Quenchers for 40% off because if you're going to add to your collection or hop on the Emotional Support Water Bottle bandwagon, you might as well save a few bucks while you're at it. Promising review: ""I used to make fun of people for using these Stanley cups; I always thought they were overpriced and overhyped. But I purchased this for my little sister who is in nursing school, and she takes this thing with her everywhere!!! All she does is rave about how amazing it is! So I bought one as well, and they really are amazing products. Made super well, they keep ice in them for hours and hours! Super comfortable to hold in your hand, not too heavy or bulky. Easy to clean and seem to be super durable. I've dropped mine I don't even know how many times now, and not a single mark! They also don't leak easy at all. Unless you're holding it completely upside down, even then it doesn't leak fast. Super happy!"" —Jon & Katie Severs Price: $27 (originally $45; deal available on select colors, including fuchsia, plum, mist, and stargaze) and shop all the Stanley deals here 3. The *newest* Amazon 4K Fire TV Stick for 50% off — that's the best price outside of Cyber Week. It has 4K picture, Dolby sound, and ~WiFi 6~ to help with uninterrupted streaming, plus smart search so you can find a movie or TV show by actor, genre (""action movies with car chases""), or even quote! Just plug into your existing TV and stream all the shows, movies, and music you want at the push of a button. Promising review: ""I've been dealing with WebOS on my LG TV for three years now, and enough is enough. Fire TV stick is  I love this thing. I can even view my Blink cameras on the big screen now; so cool. Setup is so easy and it linked to my other Alexa-enabled devices just great.

The 2nd Gen AirPods Pro for 40% off (that's $100 off, an all-new lowest price ever!) . With active noise cancellation, spatial audio, three silicone tips for customized fit, and over 24 hours of listening time with the included case, the AirPods Pro 2 give you a *ton* of bang for your buck. Promising review: ""Holy cow. Anyone with standard AirPods should upgrade to these on the next go-around, if not sooner. These are indeed a game changer! I can hear my books/music/podcasts on the train without adjusting the volume, and even while standing on the noisy platform when trains come through. The noise cancellation is amazing. I no longer cringe when seated next to noisy people first thing in the morning. The options for total noise cancellation vs. the adaptive settings are terrific. I had avoided this style previously because I found them uncomfortable compared to the original AirPods, but with the different offered attachments, it is much easier to find the comfortable option. Highly recommend the extra money for these!"" —Rosemary Price: $149 (originally $249 (and currently $249 at Apple); typically $189.99 at Amazon) AirPods 4 are also a new lowest price ever — 34% off with noise cancellation (down to $119), 31% off without (down to $89). 2. Select colors of 40-ounce Stanley Quenchers for 40% off because if you're going to add to your collection or hop on the Emotional Support Water Bottle bandwagon, you might as well save a few bucks while you're at it. Promising review: ""I used to make fun of people for using these Stanley cups; I always thought they were overpriced and overhyped. But I purchased this for my little sister who is in nursing school, and she takes this thing with her everywhere!!! All she does is rave about how amazing it is! So I bought one as well, and they really are amazing products. Made super well, they keep ice in them for hours and hours! Super comfortable to hold in your hand, not too heavy or bulky. Easy to clean and seem to be super durable. I've dropped mine I don't even know how many times now, and not a single mark! They also don't leak easy at all. Unless you're holding it completely upside down, even then it doesn't leak fast. Super happy!"" —Jon & Katie Severs Price: $27 (originally $45; deal available on select colors, including fuchsia, plum, mist, and stargaze) and shop all the Stanley deals here 3. The *newest* Amazon 4K Fire TV Stick for 50% off — that's the best price outside of Cyber Week. It has 4K picture, Dolby sound, and ~WiFi 6~ to help with uninterrupted streaming, plus smart search so you can find a movie or TV show by actor, genre (""action movies with car chases""), or even quote! Just plug into your existing TV and stream all the shows, movies, and music you want at the push of a button. Promising review: ""I've been dealing with WebOS on my LG TV for three years now, and enough is enough. Fire TV stick is I love this thing. I can even view my Blink cameras on the big screen now; so cool. Setup is so easy and it linked to my other Alexa-enabled devices just great. Picture is great, response is lightning quick."" —MattSR Price: $24.99 (originally $49.99) — and shop all of the Amazon device deals here....",2025-07-08 21:39:09,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The provided content is an Amazon Prime Day deals article discussing AirPods, Stanley Quenchers, and Fire TV Sticks.

Promising review: ""I used to make fun of people for using these Stanley cups; I always thought they were overpriced and overhyped. But I purchased this for my little sister who is in nursing school, and she takes this thing with her everywhere!!! All she does is rave about how amazing it is! So I bought one as well, and they really are amazing products. Made super well, they keep ice in them for hours and hours! Super comfortable to hold in your hand, not too heavy or bulky. Easy to clean and seem to be super durable. I've dropped mine I don't even know how many times now, and not a single mark! They also don't leak easy at all. Unless you're holding it completely upside down, even then it doesn't leak fast.

From all sorts of fitness and health metrics to communication features (like texting and calling when your iPhone is out of reach) and even a car crash detection feature that can connect you to emergency services, it'll have your back no matter what the day throws at you. It's also swimproof with 50m water resistance too! Promising review: ""The Apple Watch Series 10 with Cellular is hands-down the best smartwatch I've ever owned. It's sleek, fast, and packed with features that make everyday life easier — from tracking workouts and heart rate to answering calls and messages without needing my phone nearby. The cellular feature gives me true freedom when I'm out running or running errands, and the improved battery life easily gets me through the day.

This is a cult-favorite body cream you're going to want to slather all over your body, thanks to the deep hydration (cupuaçu butter, coconut oil, and açai oil!) and temporary skin-tightening (caffeine!) it provides, plus a fragrance with notes of salted caramel and vanilla that reviewers L O V E.

The scent of summer has found its way into Amazon's biggest sale of the year, and beauty lovers everywhere are buzzing. Sol de Janeiro's Brazilian Bum Bum Cream Set is one of the most talked-about Prime Day steals — and for good reason. For 20% off during Amazon Prime Day, this cult-favorite body care bundle is being scooped up by fans and first-time buyers alike (as it should be). It's not your typical moisturizer, either. It's a full-blown trip to your piña-colada-sipping tropical resort. In short, it's an experience, wrapped in a golden jar and sealed with buttery bliss. For those unfamiliar with the phenomenon, Brazilian Bum Bum Cream is a rich, fast-absorbing body moisturizer powered by guaraná extract — an Amazonian plant packed with caffeine. After reviewing practically the entire brand, I can attest that this holy-grail item is worth the hype. The formula also features cupuaçu butter and coconut oil, ingredients known for their skin-softening properties. But beyond the hydration benefits, it's the fragrance that turns first-time users into lifelong devotees: warm pistachio, salted caramel and vanilla notes linger on the skin for hours, making it as much a perfume as a lotion. Prime Day kicked off on July 8 and lasts until July 11, and this set is definitely one of the best Prime Day beauty deals offered right now. The celebrity seal of approval has only fueled the frenzy. Blake Lively, Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber are among the high-profile names who've made this cream a mainstay in their skincare routines. The set being offered on Amazon includes not only the standard-size cream but also travel-friendly companions that enhance the fragrance and hydration experience. So yes, I'll be shopping this two-piece set and be taking the graceful mini on my Hawaiian honeymoon this September. Layering the cream with its matching body mist or shower gel intensifies the signature Cheirosa '62 scent and makes the daily routine feel like a spa-worthy escape. If you love indulgent scents, smooth skin, and that golden-hour glow, this is your moment. While it's 20% off, I can say with full certainty that this twin pack is the most dynamic duo Prime Day has to offer. Use promo code NYPOSTAB10 to save 10% on top of Prime Day deals.

It's made of shea butter, hyaluronic acid, and a stimulating peptide complex that work so magically together you won't ever want to run out. Promising review: ""Really makes a difference.

Now I use it every night!"" —Hilary Get it from Amazon $22 (available in five flavors). 2. Clinique Almost Lipstick Tinted Lip Balm in Black Honey that has been *all the rage* on TikTok (which is how you know it's good). It's lightweight, has a touch of gloss to it, and the shade will have you saying ""mhmmmm, honey!"" from the second you apply it. BuzzFeed writer Emma Lord has personally tested this baby out. She said: ""I was very adamant about not buying this for the longest time because I am stubborn about ""expensive"" beauty products, but this is worth every penny and then some. It's so lightweight and layerable, it's foolproof to apply, and I have yet to wear a single outfit it doesn't complement??? I love watching it instantly elevate a casual look or add simple elegance to dressy ones. I wear it every day now, and after weeks of use, I've barely made a dent. Also, and maybe this is just me, but I tend to get pigment on my teeth with a lot of lip products, and I've simply never had an issue with this magic stick. Anyway, watch this TikTok of someone using it on their lips AND cheeks, because I did and oops, this lipstick FELL into my cart."" Get it from Amazon for $25 (available in two shades). 3. Sol De Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream featuring scent notes of vanilla, pistachio, and salted caramel you'll enjoy applying to your skin just as much as you'd like it as an ice cream sundae. It's also filled with vitamin E, caffeine, coconut oil, and guarana extract to help smooth, firm, and hydrate your skin. BuzzFeed editor Elizabeth Lilly says, ""I've used this stuff before and can confirm that 1) the scent is indeed intoxicating and 2) everything from this brand has scents that really STICK to you. I'm currently using the Beija Flor body wash and I can smell it on my skin hours later — which is pretty rare for a body wash."" Promising review: ""I am 60 and I could not get rid of the cellulite on my legs. I started using this product six weeks ago and can noticeably see a difference. I apply morning and evening, before bed for optimal results. It goes on smooth and has a creamy, nonsticky feel. The smell is dreamy, and even my husband has commented on the improvement.

Kiehls Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil 5.9 oz $28.50$38.0025% offBuy Now On Amazon A gentle but effective cleansing oil. The word oil can be triggering to some, especially those with oily skin. Kiehl's Midnight Recovery Botanical Cleansing Oil is a cleanser you can trust, with an affordable price tag to boot. It's one you'll want to add to your arsenal for numerous reasons. This formula is packed with botanical oils that work gently to remove dirt, makeup and grime from the epidermis without leaving a greasy residue. Say hello to soft and supple skin. Squalane beefs up the formula by replenishing the skin's barrier. Simply lather a few pumps of the product onto the face, working in circular motions before washing away with water. Simple as that.

These are the best deals in the summer sales We're almost reaching the end of Amazon Prime Day, with the deals set to wrap up tomorrow (11 July) at midnight. In a bid to compete with the online giant, many retailers have launched their own sales with reductions that match or even beat Amazon's sale. From Currys and John Lewis to Boots and Lakeland, there are plenty of big-name retailers offering deals right now. If you're not a Prime member or want to snap up some offers this weekend, once the sale has ended, you can use this page as your ultimate guide to the best summer sales. Plus, unlike with Prime Day, you don't have to be a member to shop these sales. If none of Amazon's Prime Day discounts grab your attention, or an item on your wishlist hasn't been included in the sale, you can check this page for the latest deals on our tried-and-tested favourites from rival retailers. Currys has slashed the price of thousands of its appliances and electricals, with savings on Shark, Samsung, Dyson and more. In most cases, competing retailers are price-matching Currys, but if you notice popular products dropping out of stock in other summer sales, head to Currys to check if it has them in stock. These are some of the best deals in the Currys sale: Shark FlexBreeze HydroGo misting fan: Was £129.99, now £99.99, Currys.co.uk Breville one-touch coffeehouse coffee machine: Was £349.99, now £169.99, Currys.co.uk Shark flexbreeze hydrogo misting fan: Was £129.99, now £99.99, Currys.co.uk Much like Amazon, Currys slashed the price of this portable Shark fan to £99 back in June, just in time for the arrival of an early summer heatwave. The original FlexBreeze was named best cordless fan, and this version emits a fine mist thanks to a 150ml water tank. Our reviewer wrote that the original FlexBreeze did a “great job of cooling the air to each side of the unit as well as directly in front of it”, so you can expect the same cooling relief from this tabletop model. Stock is sparse on Amazon, so it's worth checking Currys if the colour that you want isn't available. Breville one-touch coffeehouse coffee machine: Was £349.99, now £169.99, Currys.co.uk If your morning coffee is an oat flat white, you'll want to take a look at this deal on our best coffee machine for vegan milks. Our appliances expert, Zoe Phillimore, praised this feature and said, “You can tweak how much foam and steamed milk is added to your coffee”. Plus, you can store the detachable milk container in the fridge to keep it cool. Right now at Currys, there's a chunky £180 off. John Lewis often price matches Amazon's Prime Day deals, so it's worth checking out its offering to see if you can get a longer warranty or free delivery. These are some of the best deals in the John Lewis sale: Dyson supersonic straight and wavy hair dryer: Was £329.99, now £279.99, Johnlewis.com Estee Lauder advanced night repair skincare gift set: Was £69, now £48, Johnlewis.com Ninja dual zone air fryer: Was £229.99, now £151.05, Johnlewis.com Dyson supersonic straight and wavy hair dryer: Was £329.99, now £279.99, Johnlewis.com I've spotted a few of our IndyBest favourites from Dyson in the Prime Day sale, including £80 off the airwrap. You won't find the supersonic hair dryer in Amazon's deals, but you can save £50 when you buy it from John Lewis. This model doesn't come with the full range of attachments, but there is a concentrator nozzle and flyaway attachment included. We've reviewed various iterations of the supersonic hair dryer over the years, including the supersonic nural and supersonic r, and they always receive rave reviews from our testers. Estee Lauder advanced night repair skincare gift set: Was £69, now £48, Johnlewis.com The set includes a full-sized bottle of Estee Lauder's much-loved advanced night repair serum – if you buy this alone, it'll set you back around £50. This set costs around the same but includes a moisturiser and eye cream, so you're really getting your money's worth. The advanced night repair serum made it into our round-up of the best anti-ageing serums. Beauty journalist, Jane Druker, says that it “helps to visibly soften, smooth and plump” thanks to the addition of skin-quenching hyaluronic acid. Ninja dual zone air fryer: Was £229.99, now £151.05, Johnlewis.com The Ninja dual zone air fryer has been a popular buy this Amazon Prime Day, and now John Lewis has matched the online retailer's price. This gives you more options to save if you notice it dropping out of stock at either store. Our reviewer was impressed with the variety of settings on this two-drawer air fryer and said “that it takes much of the guesswork out of timing and temperature, making mealtime feel less like a chore”.

But to the companies that make the original products, similar-but-cheaper items can be bad for business. While knock-offs are nothing new, dupes — short for ""duplicate"" — have exploded in popularity in recent years. And for many younger buyers, buying an imitation is no longer something to hide. ""A lot of the consumers that we're seeing on social media, on TikTok, are so proudly displaying the dupes that they found, kind of as a badge of honour. That stigma really isn't there anymore,"" said Julie Zerbo, editor-in-chief of fashion publication The Fashion Law. The rise of dupes has also brought a corresponding wave of lawsuits from companies, saying copies of their products shouldn't be allowed to exist. American Eagle, Sol de Janeiro, Benefit Cosmetics, Deckers Brands (Ugg's parent company) and Supergoop are just a few of the fashion and beauty companies on that list. Vancouver-based Lululemon became a recent entrant when it sued Costco late last month over three products it said were knock-offs of its clothing. But are they actually illegal? Intellectual property experts say it really depends on the rights a company has over a product, and whether customers can tell the difference between the original and its copycat. When do dupes cross the line? The term ""dupe"" itself has been appearing more in legal filings, says Alexandra Roberts, law and media professor at Northeastern University — including in Lululemon's against Costco. That could partially be because their appeal has grown among online shoppers. ""Where in previous years, a company might have just said, 'Oh, this looks to us like trademark infringement,' here, [brands] are kind of building a case around the idea of [a] dupe,"" Roberts said. ""The fact that something is perceived as a dupe ... that all works its way into the allegations."" WATCH | Trying to beat online fashion copies: Trying to beat online fashion copies 8 months agoDuration 2:25 Loren Mallett, an intellectual property lawyer in Vancouver, says any case where a company says it's been copied largely depends on the rights it has over its product. Patents, industrial designs and trademarks can all protect certain parts of an item — but a company has to formally register elements like its logo or packaging design. If it hasn't, it's probably out of luck, Mallett says. And even if it has, it still might be OK to sell something really similar. The legality of a dupe depends on whether customers could be confused by the two items and think they are the exact same, Roberts says. In Lululemon's case, for example, the question might be whether buyers of the Costco sweatshirt thought they were purchasing Lululemon's Scuba hoodie, Roberts says. She says people tend to like dupes specifically because they aren't the real deal, but a cheaper alternative. And for that reason, she says, many may not be successfully litigated against. LISTEN | Dupe culture: Why Gen Z is embracing fakes: While we don't necessarily think of them as dupes, generic brands — think Life brand products sold at Shoppers Drug Mart, or Walmart's Great Value — have occupied this space for a long time, Roberts says. And historically, courts have allowed them because customers understand that one is meant to be a cheaper alternative to the other. Mallett adds that the conversation around dupes could impact companies like Lululemon in court, as many customers have said online that some of Costco's products look just like Lululemon's. The athleisure company will likely argue this as evidence that Costco wanted to pass off its product as a Lululemon item — whereas Costco will likely say it is proof the customer knew for a fact they were buying a similar-looking alternative at a lower price, according to Mallett. A case study Zerbo says many dupe-related cases are still making their way through courts. But there are some resolved ones where the lookalike has come out on top. She points to a recent conflict in the U.S. between Steve Madden and Ganni as a good example. Danish footwear brand Ganni sent cease-and-desist letters to some companies that sold certain Steve Madden shoes, saying they looked too similar to its own buckle ballerina flats and two-strap sandals. But Steve Madden turned around and sued Ganni, saying it had no right to tell those retailers they couldn't sell the similar Steve Madden shoes, because there was ""nothing new or original"" about a shoe made of leather and that has straps, eyelets and buckles — common elements in lots of footwear. Ganni ultimately walked back its original legal threats, Zerbo said, and even agreed not to sue in the future over the shoe designs. (Ganni was more successful in its home country of Denmark, however.) Zerbo says these cases show how courts generally don't want monopolies, and try to prevent giving a brand that kind of power. ""That would be bad for competition, that would be bad for consumers, prices would go through the roof."" What does that mean for my dupes? Zerbo says duping is unlikely to slow down anytime soon, as many shoppers love a good deal. She says history is full of copycat designs, which have largely been allowed to exist. Take fast fashion, for example. Companies like H&M and Forever 21 became giants mainly by replicating runway elements for a cheaper price. ""It's such a big market. There's so much consumer demand for dupes that companies would be hard pressed to stop trying to make them.""...","Depending on how similar the items are, and the rights a company holds, dupes may or may not cross legal lines To customers, a lookalike to Ugg's Tasman slippers or a knock-off of Lululemon's ultra-popular Define jacket can be a fantastic bargain. But to the companies that make the original products, similar-but-cheaper items can be bad for business.

mov_270B1673215351001A05D4F437169F66,"  We're almost reaching the end of Amazon Prime Day, with the deals set to wrap up tomorrow (11 July) at midnight. In a bid to compete with the online giant, many retailers have launched their own sales with reductions that match or even beat Amazon's sale. From Currys and John Lewis to Boots and Lakeland, there are plenty of big-name retailers offering deals right now. If you're not a Prime member or want to snap up some offers this weekend, once the sale has ended, you can use this page as your ultimate guide to the best summer sales. Plus, unlike with Prime Day, you don't have to be a member to shop these sales. If none of Amazon's Prime Day discounts grab your attention, or an item on your wishlist hasn't been included in the sale, you can check this page for the latest deals on our tried-and-tested favourites from rival retailers. Currys: up to 30 per cent off, Currys has slashed the price of thousands of its appliances and electricals, with savings on Shark, Samsung, Dyson and more. In most cases, competing retailers are price-matching Currys, but if you notice popular products dropping out of stock in other summer sales, head to Currys to check if it has them in stock. These are some of the best deals in the Currys sale: Shark FlexBreeze HydroGo misting fan: Was £129.99, now £99.99, Currys.co.ukBreville one-touch coffeehouse coffee machine: Was £349.99, now £169.99, Currys.co.uk Shark flexbreeze hydrogo misting fan: Was £129.99, now £99.99, Much like Amazon, Currys slashed the price of this portable Shark fan to £99 back in June, just in time for the arrival of an early summer heatwave. The original FlexBreeze was named best cordless fan, and this version emits a fine mist thanks to a 150ml water tank. Our reviewer wrote that the original FlexBreeze did a “great job of cooling the air to each side of the unit as well as directly in front of it”, so you can expect the same cooling relief from this tabletop model. Stock is sparse on Amazon, so it's worth checking Currys if the colour that you want isn't available. Breville one-touch coffeehouse coffee machine: Was £349.99, now £169.99, If your morning coffee is an oat flat white, you'll want to take a look at this deal on our best coffee machine for vegan milks. Our appliances expert, Zoe Phillimore, praised this feature and said, “You can tweak how much foam and steamed milk is added to your coffee”. Plus, you can store the detachable milk container in the fridge to keep it cool. Right now at Currys, there's a chunky £180 off. John Lewis: up to 50 per cent off, John Lewis often price matches Amazon's Prime Day deals, so it's worth checking out its offering to see if you can get a longer warranty or free delivery. These are some of the best deals in the John Lewis sale: Dyson supersonic straight and wavy hair dryer: Was £329.99, now £279.99, Johnlewis.comEstee Lauder advanced night repair skincare gift set: Was £69, now £48, Johnlewis.comNinja dual zone air fryer: Was £229.99, now £151.05, Johnlewis.com Dyson supersonic straight and wavy hair dryer: Was £329.99, now £279.99, I've spotted a few of our IndyBest favourites from Dyson in the Prime Day sale, including £80 off the airwrap. You won't find the supersonic hair dryer in Amazon's deals, but you can save £50 when you buy it from John Lewis. This model doesn't come with the full range of attachments, but there is a concentrator nozzle and flyaway attachment included. We've reviewed various iterations of the supersonic hair dryer over the years, including the supersonic nural and supersonic r, and they always receive rave reviews from our testers. Estee Lauder advanced night repair skincare gift set: Was £69, now £48, The set includes a full-sized bottle of Estee Lauder's much-loved advanced night repair serum – if you buy this alone, it'll set you back around £50. This set costs around the same but includes a moisturiser and eye cream, so you're really getting your money's worth. The advanced night repair serum made it into our round-up of the best anti-ageing serums. Beauty journalist, Jane Druker, says that it “helps to visibly soften, smooth and plump” thanks to the addition of skin-quenching hyaluronic acid. Ninja dual zone air fryer: Was £229.99, now £151.05, The Ninja dual zone air fryer has been a popular buy this Amazon Prime Day, and now John Lewis has matched the online retailer's price. This gives you more options to save if you notice it dropping out of stock at either store. Our reviewer was impressed with the variety of settings on this two-drawer air fryer and said “that it takes much of the guesswork out of timing and temperature, making mealtime feel less like a chore”. Boots: up to 60 per cent off, Boots has launched its summer sale with thousands of offers on beauty electricals, skincare, haircare and more. You've got five more days to shop the sale, so there'll be plenty of discounts to snap up once Amazon Prime Day is done and dusted. These are the best Boots deals now: Philips lumea 8000 series: Was £509.99, now £349.99, Boots.comShark cryoglow under eye cooling and LED face mask: Was £299.99, now £265, Boots.comSol de Janeiro limited edition cheirosa hair & body perfume mist set: Was £38, now £26.60, Boots.com Philips lumea 8000 series: Was £509.99, now £349.99, Philips' lumea IPL range is one of our favourites for hair removal, so we're pleased to see the price of older models, such as the lumea 8000, slowly going down in price. Beauty editor Lucy Partington was impressed with the results after using this IPL machine, with “hair becoming sparser after just four treatments”. Right now, there's £160 off at Boots in its super savings week sale. Shark cryoglow under eye cooling and LED face mask: Was £299.99, now £265, Boots is one of the many retailers that have reduced the price of the viral Shark LED face mask. Amazon still has the best offer, but if you're not a Prime member or you've got advantage card points to spend, you can save with this offer. Senior shopping writer Daisy Lester was left “seriously impressed” after testing the Shark cryoglow mask for eight weeks. Its 'blemish repair' mode was her favourite setting, leaving her skin's texture and appearance “significantly improved”. Sol de Janeiro limited edition cheirosa hair & body perfume mist set: Was £38, now £26.60, Here's the perfect chance to sample Sol de Janeiro's popular perfume mists, with four bottles of its much-loved scents for £26.60, working out at £6.65 per 30ml bottle. The set includes Brazilian crush, which is a personal favourite with notes of salted caramel and pistachio, as well as delícia drench, which beauty writer Lauren Cunningham says smells like “holiday in a bottle”. Lakeland: up to 50 per cent off, If you want to upgrade your al fresco dining set-up, Lakeland has some great offers on outdoor cooking appliances and fun summer buys, such as ice cream makers. Here are some of our favourite deals in the Lakeland sale:...","We're almost reaching the end of Amazon Prime Day, with the deals set to wrap up tomorrow (11 July) at midnight.

Plus all the features of the previous version, like a warm light setting for late-night reading and waterproof rating for worry-free poolside or beach reading. I've been using my Kindle Paperwhite (a previous generation) before bed for years — and after reading for a while, I turn down the brightness to a low level just slightly dimmer than I'd want — after a page or two, my brain goes ""Nope!"" and shuts off to sleep. AND it helps me not even start thinking the anxious or negative thoughts that *usually* keep me up at night. I got to upgrade to this new Kindle Paperwhite a few months ago, and the warm light feature is a game-changer. And the page turns and responsiveness of this model are indeed faster — and I can really tell the difference compared to my old Kindle! Promising review: ""I can't say enough good things about my Kindle Paperwhite — it's truly a reader's dream! The screen is crisp and easy on the eyes, even in bright sunlight or total darkness, thanks to the adjustable backlight. No glare, no straining —just pure reading bliss. The lightweight design makes it super comfortable to hold, even for long reading sessions. Plus, the battery life is incredible — I can go weeks without needing to charge it! It's also waterproof, which means I can finally read by the pool or in the bath without worrying. One of my favorite features is how easy it is to carry an entire library with me wherever I go. Whether I'm traveling, commuting, or just relaxing at home, I always have something great to read at my fingertips. If you're on the fence about getting one—do it. The Kindle Paperwhite is sleek, powerful, and makes reading more convenient and enjoyable than ever. I'm completely obsessed with mine!

My car's upholstery was so dirty from my dogs and years of NOT getting it deep cleaned. This is a game changer. I should've taken a before and after because it was awesome. Not to mention how satisfying it is seeing the dirty water get sucked back into the tank. Easy to prep. Easy to use. Easy to clean. I definitely recommend. This will be perfect for other things in the house as well because if it can tackle MY car with two big dogs, it's gold."" —Taylor L.

Plus all the features of the previous version, like a warm light setting for late-night reading and waterproof rating for worry-free poolside or beach reading. I've been using my Kindle Paperwhite (a previous generation) before bed for years — and after reading for a while, I turn down the brightness to a low level just slightly dimmer than I'd want — after a page or two, my brain goes ""Nope!"" and shuts off to sleep. AND it helps me not even start thinking the anxious or negative thoughts that *usually* keep me up at night. I got to upgrade to this new Kindle Paperwhite a few months ago, and the warm light feature is a game-changer. And the page turns and responsiveness of this model are indeed faster — and I can really tell the difference compared to my old Kindle! Promising review: ""I can't say enough good things about my Kindle Paperwhite — it's truly a reader's dream! The screen is crisp and easy on the eyes, even in bright sunlight or total darkness, thanks to the adjustable backlight. No glare, no straining —just pure reading bliss. The lightweight design makes it super comfortable to hold, even for long reading sessions. Plus, the battery life is incredible — I can go weeks without needing to charge it! It's also waterproof, which means I can finally read by the pool or in the bath without worrying. One of my favorite features is how easy it is to carry an entire library with me wherever I go. Whether I'm traveling, commuting, or just relaxing at home, I always have something great to read at my fingertips. If you're on the fence about getting one—do it. The Kindle Paperwhite is sleek, powerful, and makes reading more convenient and enjoyable than ever. I'm completely obsessed with mine! "" —Amber Goddard Price: $124.99 (originally $159.99) — and shop all the Kindle deals here 2. 34% off the TikTok-famous Bissell Little Green carpet and upholstery cleaner that sprays on water and stain-fighting cleaner, then sucks it away to blast away years' of mess — on carpet *and* furniture. Reviewers love it for banishing pet stains, spills, and more — without having to waste a lot of their valuable storage space. Promising review: ""Yup, saw it on TikTok and had to buy it. My car's upholstery was so dirty from my dogs and years of NOT getting it deep cleaned. This is a game changer. I should've taken a before and after because it was awesome. Not to mention how satisfying it is seeing the dirty water get sucked back into the tank. Easy to prep. Easy to use. Easy to clean. I definitely recommend. This will be perfect for other things in the house as well because if it can tackle MY car with two big dogs, it's gold."" —Taylor L.

The 'Instant Face Lift' cream for smoothing mature skin (44% off) We write quite a bit about mature skincare here at HuffPost, so when we spot a highly-rated firming lotion that's new to us and at a great price, we have to share. Enter: this “Instant Facelift” cream made with retinol, collagen and hyaluronic acid. From the brand Snfajohe, it's currently 44% off. Reviewers say it's a fast-absorbing, lightweight formula that brings fairly quick tightening and glowing results. Celebrated for not being greasy or sticky, the cream helps make skin softer and smoother. Reviewers are literally singing this formula's praises. “From the first application, I noticed my skin looking firmer and more hydrated,” one review wrote. ” ...I've tried many anti-aging creams, but this one truly stands out. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a real difference in their skincare routine!” A sporty-cool polo shirt for beating sunshine, heat and sweat (up to 57% off list price) Freshly marked down up to 57% off (depending on color and size, of course), this Adidas polo shirt is the ultimate summer-ready top. For one, it sports (heh) the brand's Climacool technology, which claims to keep you dry and cool in hot weather. This top is meant for tennis, so it has split seams for extra mobility and ventilated fabric that also wicks moisture, but who says you can't wear it on a casual weekend out? Grab it in men's sizes XS-XXL in one of four colors. The Pink Stuff bundle (15% off) The Pink Stuff is a longtime fan favorite around here for it's ability to clean seemingly anything. This six-piece bundle gives you the classic paste, a multi-purpose spray, a bathroom foam spray and three sponges. Promising review: ""Love it !!!! My stove is so clean from the paste. Smells good.

This 180-chew jar is loaded with colostrum, licorice and ginger root and omega 3 to relieve seasonal allergies and beautify that skin and coat.

Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. 33% off a Ninja Artisan Outdoor Pizza Oven (the lowest it's been!) with an impressive 5-in-1 functionality that can make pizza, bake, broil, warm, and proof. Once it's preheated, you'll have restaurant-quality pies with melty, gooey cheese ready to devour in just three minutes. Choose from various settings to get your preferred pizza style, whether it be pan, thin crust, New York, Neapolitan, or custom. I bet you'll appreciate the chef's view window that allows you to watch your masterpiece while it cooks...try not to drool all over the place. It includes the pizza oven, a 12"" x 12"" pizza stone, 12"" x 12"" bake pan, and quick start guide with inspiration recipes! Promising review: ""Wow, what a powerful oven. I divided the pizza dough into three sections and cooked pizza at three temperatures to find the best combination, after using the dough recipe in the included book. I liked the 550 temperature because the crust was not overly cooked or undercooked. You definitely can not walk away from the oven or get busy making another pizza as it cooks super fast. It's best to test out the oven to find your sweet spot. I'm in love with the versatility of this oven. I've been wanting to cook more pizza outside in the summer to reduce heating the house. Highly recommend this oven "" —Brooks Price: $199.95 (originally $299.99) — and shop all the Ninja deals here 2. 30% off Biodance's TikTok-beloved Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask — it works overnight to refresh your skin. No, really, it's designed to be worn while you sleep. Don't worry, it's transfer-resistant, so it won't leave a mess on your pillow! It's infused with hyaluronic acid to hydrate, collagen to maximize absorption and minimize the appearance of pores, and probiotics to strengthen the skin's barrier. Best of all, it turns transparent when your skin is done absorbing the serum, so you'll know when it's ready to take off. Promising review: ""Caught wind of this on TikTok and decided to give it a whirl. Honestly, it's pretty solid! It really makes my skin look tight and shiny, like I just came out of a professional facial. It's an overnight mask, so yeah, it does have to stay on for a while, which is a bit of a hassle, but the payoff? Totally worth it. My skin feels more elastic, and the pores look minimized, too. If you don't mind the long wear time, this mask could be a game changer for your skincare routine!"" —Nala Price: $13.30 for four (originally $19) — and shop all the Biodance deals here 3. 29% off Puracy's stain remover powered by enzymes to completely remove the most annoying stains. (We're talking grass, blood, tomato, oil, sweat, and more!) Just spray on, let sit (overnight for the toughest spots), and wash. I will never (ever ever) buy a different stain remover again! Check out a TikTok of the laundry spray in action. And it's totally biodegradable too. These stain remover is IT. I spilled Thai yellow curry ALL OVER a brand new set of *light blue* Lou & Grey sweats, and this stuff got it out perfectly. I will NEVER not keep this stuff on hand. Just apply, let it sit a while for toucher stains, then simply run as usual in the wash!...",2025-07-11 22:01:02,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The provided text is an Amazon Prime Day deals article discussing various products like a pizza oven, a skincare mask, and a stain remover.

mov_412EE09BA5407D8806E95E9C5FAD6082,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Como era de esperar antes de que se pusiera en marcha, el Mundial de Clubes entronizó a un equipo europeo. Pero no fue ninguno de los candidatos que estaban en la primera línea, empezando por un Paris Saint Germain que se llevó un fuerte revolcón en la final. Antes habían quedado en el camino otros pesos pesados, como Bayern Munich, Inter o Real Madrid. El sistema de clasificación había dejado afuera a Barcelona y Liverpool, dos grandes animadores de la temporada, tanto en sus ligas como en la Champions League. En medio de ese nutrido frente europeo se coló un Chelsea que llegaba en un segundo pelotón y terminó dando un paso al frente. En realidad fue un salto gigantesco, pateó el tablero internacional al golear 3-0 a Paris Saint Germain. Le alcanzó un tiempo para establecer una diferencia que le quitó cualquier misterio a la resolución de la final. Fueron tres goles en la primera etapa y un ejercicio de conservación de la ventaja en la segunda. Un partido perfecto del club londinense, que hace poco había tenido figuración internacional con la obtención de la Conference League -tercer trofeo en importancia de la UEFA- al vencer a Betis. Y había finalizado cuarto en la Premier League. El zurdazo de Palmer, en un definición muy parecida al primer gol, se convertirá en el 2-0 de Chelsea - Créditos: @Matt Slocum Y más gloria para Enzo Fernández, doble campeón del mundo, en el nivel de selección y club, y también continental, con la Copa América que festejó hace un año en suelo estadounidense. Personalidad y jerarquía futbolística componen el perfil del volante argentino.

Su ascendencia dentro del grupo quedó a salvo, al ser designado como uno de los dos capitanes. Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad El repertorio futbolístico de Enzo es enorme. Si en la selección irrumpió con fuerza como volante central en pleno Mundial de Qatar, en Chelsea explota sus condiciones más ofensivas, sin desentenderse del repliegue para la recuperación de la pelota. En el exitoso 4-2-3-1 que dispuso Enzo Maresca para la final, Enzo ocupó posiciones adelantadas, casi en la misma línea que el centro-delantero João Pedro. Recostado preferentemente sobre la izquierda, le dio profundidad y continuidad a los ataques con asistencias que fueron estocadas para la defensa de PSG. Disputó un gran primer tiempo, fue actor principal en la sorprendente goleada por 3-0. Cansado -en ese mismo estadio había sufrido un golpe de calor en la semifinal contra Fluminense-, su rendimiento bajó un poco en el segundo período, hasta que fue reemplazado a los 15 minutos, con una molestia muscular en la pierna izquierda. Se llevó la ovación de los hinchas de Chelsea y cerró su Mundial con un gol y tres asistencias. Y agrandó su saldo favorable en finales, con siete títulos (Defensa y Justicia, River, selección argentina y Chelsea) y una derrota (Carabao Cup inglesa).

Las especulaciones se desvanecieron ante la realidad que llegó desde el campo, bajo un sol que hizo subir la temperatura a más de 30 grados.

Chelsea pareció sacar fuerzas y motivación de las previsiones que lo ubicaban un escalón por debajo de un Paris Saint Germain quizá demasiado confiado de su condición de favorito. Pecó de suficiencia contra un Chelsea que se le fue al humo desde el primer minuto, dispuesto a desafiarlo, sin complejos.
