mov_4E84BFB5343D9C7FC77850B6F7B1CCC3,"  A dedicated real ale enthusiast, who has embarked on the world's longest pub crawl for more than 40 years, has marked his 24,000th pub visit. Peter Hill celebrated his 69th birthday with a pint at the Elephant & Castle in Dudley, West Midlands, reaching this impressive milestone on June 20. His extraordinary pub crawl has seen him traverse 400,000 miles and down an astonishing 60,000 pints since he first started in 1984, when a pint was a mere 64p. Peter and his mates, known as the Black Country Ale Tairsters, began their unique journey of visiting different pubs after growing tired of frequenting the same local. Since then, Peter has made it into the record books by scouring the country far and wide, averaging 11 pub visits every week with the goal of ticking off every pub listed in the CAMRA guide. Committed Peter has accomplished the feat of having a drink in every pub in Wales, enjoying a pint on 69 islands around the UK, and popping into a pub in every British county. The father-of-two, from West Bromwich, shared: ""It's been a great adventure and I've met some amazing people along the way. I'm not sure if I'll ever stop, as I still really enjoy it. There's still hundreds of pubs to go, so I'll keep on going while I can."" He added: ""There's a little group of us who go, the numbers have gone up and down as people have got married, sometimes I just go by myself. We used to get a little drunk in the early days but it's more of a mature hobby now and I always take it easy and pace myself."" The group was established 41 years ago with the aim of visiting all 300 pubs listed on a map distributed by the local Banks's Brewery in Wolverhampton. After ticking off every single one, they decided to keep going, embarking on increasingly ambitious challenges to raise funds for charity. One room of his house is now crammed with 280 lever-arch files documenting each pub visit, complete with photos, menus and other keepsakes from his journeys. Retired engineer Peter, who is married to Dawn, 66, reminisced: ""We started back in November 1984 with a group of mates and my dad when the price of a pint was just 64p. We just got a bit bored of going to the same old place and it was my dad's idea to start visiting 300 from a Banks's map of Wolverhampton pubs. Then we sort of said 'shall we get to 1,000?' Then it was 2,000, then 3,000 and it just never stopped from there. ""We set a world record for the longest pub crawl but it was never about that. I'm just enjoying my life while trying to raise a bit of money for charity. ""I have raised over £35,000 for good causes over the years, I only ask for a quid a pub really but some landlords give more. We like to raise money for the local children's hospital wherever we are and also for the Air Ambulance. ""We have seen the industry drastically change over the years. It's sad to see so many pubs struggling, the price of the beer doesn't help – you can pay £7 a pint and even over a tenner for some of these fancy craft ales. ""But I don't go for them. My favourites are Oakham Cistra, Abbeydale Moonshine or Deception, Ossett White Rat and Black Country Ales. ""We've been to the Shetlands, Orkneys, Jersey, Guernsey. And to parts of Europe too as we like to visit military and war sites, like the Somme. ""I always leave a calling card which I have signed by a pub team member to prove I have been in. The wife is OK with it, she just accepts it's my hobby. It's our anniversary next week and she wants to go to Greenwich. ""So of course, I've checked if there's a few pubs I need to chalk off down there and there is, so we'll be popping for couple of pints. ""I'm trying to do my bit to keep the pub scene alive. I'll keep going until the beer runs out.""

mov_A747E85A1329BF21681953B79DA3CB67,"  SPR_COMBO[zh-tw]護手霜怎麼挑？ 5大重點學會選購秘訣
不同族群的手部保養需求不相同，有些重視高效滋潤，有些重視吸收不黏膩，也有些將護手霜當香氛享受，究竟該怎麼挑？ 1.熟齡、極乾燥雙手
年齡增長、乾性膚質或在冬季較寒冷時，會讓雙手容易乾燥、長細紋，甚至脫皮。 適合選擇高油脂含量，例如乳油木果脂、蜂蠟、植物油(橄欖油、甜杏仁油、摩洛哥堅果油等等)，搭配密集修護配方，幫助滋潤並鞏固肌膚屏障。 延伸閱讀：

2.主婦
常接觸洗碗精與清潔劑的主婦族群，手部易乾裂受損。 建議選擇有修護成份，質地偏潤的護手霜，例如甘油、泛醇(維他命B5)等等，最好還能形成保護膜，能在肌表加強防護，減少清潔時水分流失。 3.上班族
需要長時間打電腦或使用手機的上班族，最怕護手霜過於油膩。 選擇輕盈快吸型質地最實用，可含玻尿酸、積雪草萃取，兼顧清爽與修護。 4.香氛控
喜愛將護手霜當作日常香氛的人，可挑選出自香氛品牌，延伸自香水的款式，擦上彷彿補香一樣，自帶迷人香氣。 5.富貴手
這類型的手部肌膚容易乾癢、脫皮甚至龜裂出血，建議選擇無香料、低敏溫和配方且有修護力的護手霜，像包括：神經醯胺、泛醇(維他命B5)、燕麥萃取等成份。 護手霜塗抹技巧
擦護手霜時可別隨便擦擦，搭配按摩可以幫助吸收，打造更柔嫩細緻的美手。 1.先手背後手心
先將護手霜擠在手背，用另一手手背推開，避免手心一開始就過於滑膩，影響後續按摩。 2.螺旋按摩
以指腹畫小圓方式，從手背往手心輕柔按摩，促進吸收。 3.指縫與關節別忽略
特別針對指節、指縫等細節處，以拇指輕壓揉按，不錯過任何一個死角。 4.指緣護理
加強按摩指緣與甲床周圍，避免乾裂倒刺，幫助指甲邊緣維持柔嫩狀態。 5.帶到手腕
最後可順勢將護手霜帶到手腕，讓整隻手都細緻滑順。 使用護手霜的最佳時機
護手霜的正確使用方式，針對不同時機，用量與塗抹技巧也不盡相同。 1.早晚固定保養，形成護手習慣
早晨出門前塗抹，為雙手建立一層保護膜，減少白天外界刺激。 晚間睡前是修護黃金期，可使用較滋養的護手霜，搭配按摩加強吸收，有需要時可戴上棉質手套，隔天醒來雙手更柔嫩。 2.洗手後、接觸水分後記得補擦
每次洗手、洗碗或酒精清潔後，手部皮脂膜容易被破壞，既可馬上補擦護手霜，維持保濕屏障。 若環境乾燥(如在冷氣房或是冬天時)，可依需要每2～3小時重複塗抹，預防乾燥。 3.用量可視膚況與護手霜質地調整
日間保養或辦公室使用，使用約5元硬幣大小用量即可，避免手感油膩影響工作。 晚上可加量至10元硬幣大小，並延伸至手腕、指緣，仔細按摩吸收。 2025 20款護手霜推薦：滋潤不黏膩的人氣選擇

成份包括甜杏仁油、有「植物界的玻尿酸」之稱的藥蜀葵、金盞花、澳洲堅果油與紅花籽油，充分滋潤雙手肌膚。...","SPR_COMBO[zh-tw]護手霜怎麼挑？ 5大重點學會選購秘訣 不同族群的手部保養需求不相同，有些重視高效滋潤，有些重視吸收不黏膩，也有些將護手霜當香氛享受，究竟該怎麼挑？ 1.熟齡、極乾燥雙手 年齡增長、乾性膚質或在冬季較寒冷時，會讓雙手容易乾燥、長細紋，甚至脫皮。 適合選擇高油脂含量，例如乳油木果脂、蜂蠟、植物油(橄欖油、甜杏仁油、摩洛哥堅果油等等)，搭配密集修護配方，幫助滋潤並鞏固肌膚屏障。 延伸閱讀： 【保養知識王】手指脫皮、指緣粗糙怎麼辦？ 掌握7大成因、5招預防，還有3步驟教你正確修剪倒刺 2.主婦 常接觸洗碗精與清潔劑的主婦族群，手部易乾裂受損。 建議選擇有修護成份，質地偏潤的護手霜，例如甘油、泛醇(維他命B5)等等，最好還能形成保護膜，能在肌表加強防護，減少清潔時水分流失。 3.上班族 需要長時間打電腦或使用手機的上班族，最怕護手霜過於油膩。 選擇輕盈快吸型質地最實用，可含玻尿酸、積雪草萃取，兼顧清爽與修護。 4.香氛控 喜愛將護手霜當作日常香氛的人，可挑選出自香氛品牌，延伸自香水的款式，擦上彷彿補香一樣，自帶迷人香氣。 5.富貴手 這類型的手部肌膚容易乾癢、脫皮甚至龜裂出血，建議選擇無香料、低敏溫和配方且有修護力的護手霜，像包括：神經醯胺、泛醇(維他命B5)、燕麥萃取等成份。 護手霜塗抹技巧 擦護手霜時可別隨便擦擦，搭配按摩可以幫助吸收，打造更柔嫩細緻的美手。 1.先手背後手心 先將護手霜擠在手背，用另一手手背推開，避免手心一開始就過於滑膩，影響後續按摩。 2.螺旋按摩 以指腹畫小圓方式，從手背往手心輕柔按摩，促進吸收。 3.指縫與關節別忽略 特別針對指節、指縫等細節處，以拇指輕壓揉按，不錯過任何一個死角。 4.指緣護理 加強按摩指緣與甲床周圍，避免乾裂倒刺，幫助指甲邊緣維持柔嫩狀態。 5.帶到手腕 最後可順勢將護手霜帶到手腕，讓整隻手都細緻滑順。 使用護手霜的最佳時機 護手霜的正確使用方式，針對不同時機，用量與塗抹技巧也不盡相同。 1.早晚固定保養，形成護手習慣 早晨出門前塗抹，為雙手建立一層保護膜，減少白天外界刺激。 晚間睡前是修護黃金期，可使用較滋養的護手霜，搭配按摩加強吸收，有需要時可戴上棉質手套，隔天醒來雙手更柔嫩。 2.洗手後、接觸水分後記得補擦 每次洗手、洗碗或酒精清潔後，手部皮脂膜容易被破壞，既可馬上補擦護手霜，維持保濕屏障。 若環境乾燥(如在冷氣房或是冬天時)，可依需要每2～3小時重複塗抹，預防乾燥。 3.用量可視膚況與護手霜質地調整 日間保養或辦公室使用，使用約5元硬幣大小用量即可，避免手感油膩影響工作。 晚上可加量至10元硬幣大小，並延伸至手腕、指緣，仔細按摩吸收。 2025 20款護手霜推薦：滋潤不黏膩的人氣選擇 市面上護手霜眾多，一起來看看今年推薦的清單品項。 產品1：Bioderma貝膚黛瑪滋潤美甲護手霜 運用B3菸鹼醯胺、乳油木果油，修護舒緩，柔嫩滋養雙手與指緣。 還有聚季銨鹽-51及獨家肌膚仿生修護專利(DAF)，強化肌膚屏障，宛如隱形手套，經反覆沖洗10次後，仍能提供持久的保護。 無致敏香料、無酒精、無防腐劑，無色素，全家大小都適用。 容量：50ml 價錢：NT190 產品2：DR.WU瞬適膚舒緩保濕護手霜 針對手部乾燥、粗糙與反覆不適設計，質地輕盈、好吸收，即時舒緩並穩定膚況。 除應用 SENSIPHYTE瞬適膚屏障修護科技外，還添加茶樹精油與通過法規認可的抗菌成份，於肌膚表層形成隱形防護膜，強化防禦力。 配方溫和低敏，無添加酒精、香精、色料與 Parabens，適合改善手部敏弱膚況。 容量：50ml 價錢：NT450 產品3：新肌霓INGENI澎潤新生美手霜 新肌霓INGENI旗下熱賣明星商品「美手霜」系列2025年全新升級，還推出最新款的澎潤新生美手霜。 新肌霓特別與臺東小農攜手合作，將台灣原生品種「狐尾栗精萃」融入產品配方中，來自米糠萃取出的油脂，能有效加強肌膚屏障修護，改善粗糙與乾燥，為手部肌膚提供更多滋潤。 同時，每款護手霜都添加了深海火山多醣體、海茴香、黃金海藻、岩薔薇等活性成份，發揮多重保養功效。 澎潤新生美手霜更專注於「手背護理」，訴求淡化細紋並均勻提亮膚色，抵禦光老化。 容量：50ml 價錢：NT620 產品4：SAWWA方舟舒緩滋養護手霜 來自歐洲專利蓼藍萃取、韓國專利CalmYang與舒敏六胜肽作為主要修護關鍵，幫助肌膚形成保護作用、抵禦外在環境的傷害，同時撫平雙手紋路，立即舒緩不適感。 全方位高保濕保護配方，酵母發酵100%天然角鯊烷輕爽不黏膩，讓細緻的肌膚更加健康並提供長時間持久滋潤。 香氣以東方清新香甜的桃金孃搭配柔和自然的樹枝氣息，交織著白雪松與廣藿香的沉穩大地氣息。 容量：30ml 價錢：NT580 產品5：Naturals by Watsons摩洛哥堅果修護護手霜 Naturals by Watsons是屈臣氏旗下的天然系保養品牌，以綠色永續為核心。 全系列產品採用100%純素配方，不經動物測試，並嚴選全球有機認證植萃，旗下產品均蘊含超過95%天然來源成份。 摩洛哥堅果系列精選擁有「液態黃金」美譽的摩洛哥堅果油，富含維生素E與必需脂肪酸，能深入滲透肌膚，提供卓越修護與滋養效果。 護手霜同樣透過高效修護配方，滋養雙手，減少乾燥與淡化細紋，恢復細緻柔滑。 容量：30ml 價錢：NT179 產品6：L:A BRUKET 221 護手霜-雲杉 集結溫和的乳木果油、純淨椰子油，以及具有高度修護力的白芒花籽油，具備高度滋潤度同時低敏不易刺激肌膚。 還有來自北歐森林的清新氣息。 木質控不容錯過。 輕潤質地吸收快速，保濕修復乾燥的手部肌膚，強化肌膚屏障、抵禦外界環境侵害，特別推薦給經常使用鍵盤、觸控螢幕的使用者。 容量：30ml、70ml 價錢：NT600、NT950 延伸閱讀： 【美妝說書人】來自瑞典的溫柔保養L:A BRUKET必買5樣推薦！ 台灣還開了首間街邊店 產品7：L'OCCITANE歐舒丹乳油木護手霜 配方蘊含96%天然成份，蘊含20%乳油木果油揉合多重天然保濕因子，富含OMEGA 6 & 3及維他命E，能滋養修護、舒緩因外在刺激帶來的泛紅與不適，避免乾燥脫屑等。 加上天然植物性脂質有助於重新平衡肌膚並提升防禦機制，維持肌膚微生態平衡，有效強化建立健康的肌膚屏障。 容量：30ml、75ml、150ml 價錢：NT420、NT900、NT1,220 產品8：Jurlique茱莉蔻玫瑰護手霜 成份包括甜杏仁油、有「植物界的玻尿酸」之稱的藥蜀葵、金盞花、澳洲堅果油與紅花籽油，充分滋潤雙手肌膚。...",2025-07-03 16:00:00,zh-tw,WEB,,,™®,,1,False,False,"The content is a comprehensive guide about hand creams and their selection, but does not mention Drunk Elephant specifically.

[Learn more] Amazon's big Prime Day sale doesn't start until tomorrow (Tuesday) but they've launched some great deals already. There's 63% off Olay's luxurious whipped moisturiser that leaves skin 'feeling fresh' and has a 'gorgeous scent'. The Olay Regenerist Whip Day Face Cream is usually £38 but it's down to just £14. The whipped moisturiser transforms from cream to liquid on contact and is quickly absorbed, giving a smooth matte finish without clogging pores. The lightweight, non-greasy cream acts as a 2-in-1 primer and moisturiser, ready for make-up. Enriched with vitamin B3, it helps promote skin cell renewal and reduce fine lines and wrinkles – and also provides SPF30 protection.

It has a touch of luxury when using it and lasts well.” Whipped face products have become a popular beauty trend in recent years. Drunk Elephant's Lala Retro Whipped Cream delivers intense hydration and costs £58, while Bondi Sands' Daydream Whipped Moisturiser is on offer at LookFantastic for £7.49.

I have been tempted to pay a fortune for other hyped skin care, believing they would be better. Not a chance, I stick with Regenerist and my skin looks lovely."" Some felt it was a little too expensive when not on offer, saying: ""Bit pricey considering it is whip, meaning there is slightly less actual product than original.""

In questo articolo, andremo a scoprire alcune delle novità più interessanti nel mercato della bellezza, analizzando le loro caratteristiche, gli ingredienti e il potenziale impatto sulla tua routine di bellezza quotidiana. Dai sieri innovativi ai primer multifunzionali, vedremo come questi prodotti si distinguono nella folla e quali metriche possono guidare le nostre scelte. Le ultime innovazioni nei sieri e nei primer I dati ci raccontano una storia interessante riguardo ai sieri e ai primer che stanno conquistando il mercato. Prendiamo ad esempio il nuovo siero di Drunk Elephant, un prodotto che promette di regalare una pelle radiosa e ben idratata. Questo siero ha dimostrato, in uno studio clinico, un incremento immediato dell'idratazione della pelle del 115%: un risultato che ha catturato l'attenzione degli esperti del settore. La leggerezza della formulazione e la sua capacità di migliorare l'elasticità e la fermezza della pelle lo rendono un candidato ideale per chi cerca risultati tangibili. Sei curioso di sapere se può fare la differenza nella tua routine? Non possiamo dimenticare il primer di Anastasia Beverly Hills, arricchito con SPF, che rappresenta un altro esempio di come i marchi stiano rispondendo alle esigenze dei consumatori. Con l'84% di ingredienti dedicati alla cura della pelle, questo prodotto non solo protegge dai raggi UV, ma offre anche un'idratazione duratura.

Un ottimo esempio è Deborah Pagani, ex colorista di celebrità e ora fondatrice di un marchio di lusso. Ha lanciato un siero per capelli che combina ingredienti di alta qualità come acido ialuronico e squalano. Questo prodotto non solo idrata e ripara, ma offre anche un profumo distintivo, frutto della collaborazione con un noto profumiere. Pagani ha dichiarato di voler rompere gli standard di settore, puntando su ingredienti puliti e risultati efficaci. Non è interessante vedere come una strategia di marketing ben definita possa supportare un prodotto di bellezza? Analizzando le metriche di performance, è evidente che la popolarità del siero di Pagani è in crescita, grazie anche alla sua capacità di creare un'esperienza di lusso per il consumatore.

Strategie di implementazione e KPI da monitorare Se desideri implementare strategie simili nel marketing dei prodotti di bellezza, è fondamentale concentrarsi su alcuni KPI chiave. Tra questi, il tasso di conversione (CTR), il ritorno sulla spesa pubblicitaria (ROAS) e il modello di attribuzione sono metriche essenziali che possono fornire informazioni dettagliate sulla performance delle campagne. Monitorare questi KPI permette di ottimizzare le strategie di marketing e di adattarsi rapidamente alle esigenze del mercato.

Learn more Creating the perfect summer skin is all about two things; hydration and glow. We all want a base that feels lightweight, comfortable and easy to wear whilst still giving us some added radiance, which is why we're loving this clever skincare hack that Zara McDermott shared on her Instagram recently. Zara used only two products to create the look; the L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion and the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Filler Replumping Water Cream, and although Zara herself is an ambassador for the brand, she revealed she'd spotted the hack going viral elsewhere and had to try it out for herself. If you're keen to copy her look, now is the ideal time as both products have landed in the Amazon Prime Day sale, with the Glotion slashed from £12.79 to £8.99, whilst the Replumping Water Cream has a huge 54% saving, taking it from £29.99 to £13.79. READ MORE: Millie Mackintosh shares her makeup hack to get a '10 second facelift' READ MORE: Frankie Bridge's go-to IPL hair removal device now has £500 off in flash sale Whilst it's obviously nothing groundbreaking to be wearing a moisturiser and a glow enhancer, the two can often be tricky to pair together, with some glow serums not sitting well over the top of your moisturiser. However Zara's hack involves blending the two hydrating products together, which avoids separation and patchiness that can happen when you try to layer them. That's why the L'Oréal Paris Replumping Water Cream is the perfect pick for this technique, as it has a non-greasy finish, not to mention a handy press down top which lets you mix the two together on top of the moisturiser, creating minimal waste. Zara showed how quick and easy it was to do, by pumping some moisturiser into the top of the pot before adding a healthy squeeze of the L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion and mixing it together with her finger. She then applied it directly onto her face using just her fingers to blend it all together, before sharing her amazement at the results. Zara's face had an instantly smoother look and a more radiant glow, whilst still looking like she was wearing nothing at all, giving her skin the perfect natural glow for summer.

It doesn't shift colors as magically as the other version, but it's a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lip. I personally will live, breathe, and die by the magic of $25 ""universal"" Black Honey version — it lasts FOREVER and also functions as the perfect blush — but it sells out so often that I am also deeply relieved to know it has a cheap alternative in case of lip emergency! Promising review: ""I absolutely love this product. The dark color is perfectly sheer. It also adds the most beautiful color to your lips. I am a Clinique Black Honey lip fan, and this gives me the same look for a fraction of the cost. I love it and have multiple that I keep in various spots. Not sticky either, which is my biggest gripe about lip glosses. My hair doesn't get stuck in this like some glosses, but I get the shine."" —Hamps5 Get it from Amazon for $6 (also available in four other shades). 2. A set of square stemmed wineglasses inspired by the iconic Crate & Barrel version, except these are durable as heck (good for particularly rowdy wine-and-cheese nights). Reviewers especially love these chic, understated glasses because they work well for red and white wines. Promising review: ""We've had four of these glasses for over six months now and finally just added four more to our collection. These glasses are SO CHIC and are very similar to ones sold at Crate & Barrel but are MUCH more durable. Unlike the C&B glasses, you can cheers without feeling like the glasses will break. In fact, they've tipped over in the sink a few times and are still intact. They dry beautifully, sparkle after the dishwasher and we get so many compliments on them. I love them!"" —Katie B Get a set of two from Amazon for $27.99. 3. L'Oréal Paris Makeup True Match Lumi Glotion designed to enhance your skin's natural ✨ glow✨ just like the pricy Drunk Elephant drops — perfect for anyone who wants a lightweight alternative to foundation or just a lil' extra low-effort, ethereal shimmer in their lives. Promising review: ""Love love love this stuff. This is such a stellar product that is so versatile. Can be worn alone to put some glowy life to skin. Add to foundation or layer it. Beautiful. Use it as a base where you put highlighter on top. Mix some with moisturizer. This, in my opinion, is better than so many high-luxury brands that make similar products.

mov_938934D3DC646AFCBCD354E2E246EC91,"  Healthy, glowing skin straight from your bathroom Last year, we renovated our house. It cost a fortune. So holidays abroad were well and truly put on hold. As a result, I have become a dab hand at faking that gorgeous glow that you really only get after a week or two on holiday. I'm talking unrivalled radiance, sun-kissed cheeks and golden limbs that make every outfit look better. As a beauty editor, I've made it my mission over the past year to find the products that warm up the skin to make me look (and feel) healthier quickly. From tinted SPFs and bronzers, to instant tans and illuminating primers, trust me when I say I have done the legwork to find out which products apply well, look most natural and crucially, make me look radiant and tanned. Because, call me fickle, that's all I really ever want. Here I break down the different steps of my ultimate instant glow routine, which I swear by... My love of self-tan started with tanning drops. As a naturally fair 'English rose', I had always been incredibly nervous of fake tan and the inevitable mishaps that come with it. However, when I was introduced to the Isle Of Paradise Self Tanning Drops, I liked that they gave me the sense of control. It wasn't long before these little drops of sunshine became a firm fixture in my everyday skincare routine. I believe the recommendation is to use them every other day, but a few drops in my moisturiser every morning means that my skin always has a lovely, glowy canvas to apply the rest of my products. The Caudalie Self-Tan Sun Drops have become another favourite. To avoid any obvious tell-tale signs around my hairline, I use a big kabuki brush to buff my moisturiser and tanning drops in, which allows for a more natural finish. Isle of Paradise elf Tanning Face Drops in Medium Self-Tan Sun Drops Once I've applied my moisturiser, laced with tanning drops, I go in with my SPF. I've always loved a product that does more, and a base product with added sun protection is right up my street. Heliocare's 360 Colour Water Gel Bronze SPF50+ gives my skin just the right amount of coverage, evens out any irregular tone in an instant and blends in beautifully. The texture is similar to a lightweight foundation, so once I've applied it with my hands, I often buff it in with a foundation brush in areas that need thinning out slightly, like around my nose. Despite its name, it warms, rather than bronzes, the skin. And it does so beautifully. The viral Beauty of Joseon Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen is another knockout product, with 12 shades to choose from. 360 Colour Water Gel Bronze SPF50+ Beauty of Joseon Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen SPF30 PA+++ Every time I wear the L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion, I receive a compliment. Not only does it add a touch of colour to the skin, but it's the pearlescent sheen that it leaves behind that really makes a difference. You can use it as a primer, as I like to, tapped in as a highlighter or mixed in with your foundation for a more subtle finish. Vieve's iconic Skin Nova Instant Radiance Primer works similarly, but without the bronzing effect. Both transform tired skin in an instant. L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion Skin Nova Instant Radiance Primer Bronzer is arguably the must-have product in any glowing skin routine. Everybody has a preferred texture; mine will always be cream. I have dry and often dehydrated skin, so I prefer cream and liquid textures that won't settle in dry patches or fine lines. I couldn't write about tanned-looking skin without including Chanel's mega (in size and results) Les Beiges Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream. Not only does it give a natural-looking effect (which is down to its velvet matte finish), but it lasts and lasts, so is worth the investment. Earlier this year, the shade range grew, meaning it finally works for all skin tones. I can't ignore the fact that this giant bronzer does not travel well, so when I'm away from home or on the go, I use the Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Truffle. This twist-up cream bronzer has a slightly dewier finish compared to Chanel's, but the pigment payoff is great, and stick formulations make for easy application.
