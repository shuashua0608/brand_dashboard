n0pn799,"  Hi there! sorry for the late response, may I ask what type of acne do you have? Im not really an expert on mine but I get acne mostly on my cheeks and nose (sometimes on my chin and rarely on my forehead) I also get a little bit oily throughout the day and I've noticed eating cleaner helps reduce my acne. I struggle with PIH and somewhat sensitive skin and wanted to try the differin gel alongside this AA brand but I'm scared it will just cause more breakouts. Do you have any suggestions on how to start these products and how long did it take to see results? Btw rn I only use the cerave foaming cleanser and la roche posay triple repair moisturizer for PM and AM I use cerave acne foaming cream, the same moisturizer, but with black girl kids sunscreen SPF 50. I also use makeup everyday. Again, so sorry Ik you're not a dermatologist but you seem very knowledgeable but I just wanted to know if those 2 products could improve my acne and if I should change/remove any of the current products im using.","Hi there! sorry for the late response, may I ask what type of acne do you have?

1ltrmnr,"  Hey everyone, Looking for some advice, support, or recommendations. Even just someone who has been in the same boat. Pics: 1st photo from Nov 2024 (before restarting Yaz), White shirt x2 from 3rd June, Last 3 from today. Backstory: I was on Yaz birth control consistently for about a year and my skin actually did quite well on it. Then I stopped taking it for 6 months. I restarted Yaz in February, and ever since then, my skin just hasn't been the same. I've been getting more chin and jawline breakouts (some inflamed, some closed comedones), and nothing seems to be properly clearing them. Skincare I was using: • Cleanser: La Roche Posay Effaclar Foaming Cleanser (PM only) • Treatment: The Ordinary Azelaic Acid Suspension 10% to get rid of PIE • Moisturiser: Simple Light Moisturiser As I used to have no problem with my skin apart from a couple of spots here and there I decided to cut out all skincare 2 days ago. Literally just rinsing with water. I've considered using Cicaplast Baume B5 as a gentle moisturiser, but I'm worried it's too heavy and might clog me more, so I haven't used it yet. I'm unsure if I should even be moisturizing right now. My questions: 1. What's the best way to calm my skin down in this kind of flare-up phase? 2. Should I go fully minimalist — like, no products at all — or is that risky for healing? 4. Has anyone else had this kind of delayed skin reaction from restarting hormonal birth control (esp. Yaz)? I'm honestly feeling a bit lost. I know my skin won't change overnight, but I don't want to keep irritating it or over-treating it either. If anyone's been through something similar, I'd love to hear your story or see what worked for you. Thanks so much","Hey everyone, Looking for some advice, support, or recommendations.

mov_D85AA57C7F04CC3ACC3700FBE1009A0E,"  Wimbledon, one of four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, is underway. Some tennis players make tens of millions of dollars each year. Coco Gauff, Carlos Alcaraz, and Naomi Osaka were some of the highest-paid players in 2024. It's time to don your best tennis whites and sip a Pimm's Cup: Wimbledon is here. Wimbledon, the third Grand Slam tennis tournament, began on June 30 and wraps up on July 13. Some major players have already been eliminated from the tournament, including third-seed Alexander Zverev, ninth-seed Daniil Medvedev, and 12th-seed Frances Tiafoe for the men, and second- through-fifth-seeds Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini, and Zheng Qinwen for the women. In other words, it's anyone's game. Tennis is one of the biggest sports in the world, and according to Tennis.com, the number of players is only growing. There was a jump of nearly 2 million tennis players in the US from 2023 to 2024. While becoming a professional tennis player is grueling work, it can lead to huge paydays. Forbes ranked the highest-paid tennis players in the world in 2024, with earnings ranging from $13.7 million to an eye-popping $42.3 million. Here are the highest-earning tennis players in the world, and how they did it. 10. Aryna Sabalenka Sabalenka, a 27-year-old champ from Belarus, was ranked the first seed at Wimbledon this year, and remains the only woman from the top five still in competition. She's also ranked No. 1 in the world by the WTA. Forbes reported Sabalenka earned a total of $13.7 million last year: $6.7 million in prize money and $7 million in sponsorships and other deals. Most recently, she won the 2024 US Open and the 2024 Australian Open. She also made it to the finals of the 2025 Australian Open and the 2025 French Open. Sabalenka, who has 3 million followers on Instagram, has partnerships with Wilson, Nike, and Audemars Piguet. 9. Casper Ruud Ruud skipped Wimbledon this year, though he was seeded at No. 15. He announced on June 21 that a knee injury was hindering his ability to play, per ESPN. The 26-year-old hails from Norway, and although he's never won a Grand Slam (he's been runner-up three times), he's still earned a pretty penny. Forbes estimated that he earned $13.9 million last year, with $10 million coming from off-the-court endeavors and $3.9 million from winnings. His biggest endorsements are Samsonite, Vitamin Well, watch brand Fleming, Yonex, and Varsity Headwear. 8. Naomi Osaka Osaka, 27, has been one of the best-known tennis players in the world since her surprise 2018 US Open win over Serena Williams. In the years following, she's won another US Open and two Australian Opens. She also made it to the third round of Wimbledon for the first time since 2018 this year, though she was knocked out by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Osaka, who was born in Japan, earned an estimated $14.6 million last year, and just $600,000 of that came from winnings, Forbes reported. The remaining $14 million came from off-the-court partnerships with Maybelline, Etsy, Nike, and her own media company, Hana Kumo. She also has an impressively loyal fan base of 2.8 million Instagram followers. 7. Daniil Medvedev Medvedev, who was seeded at No. 9, has already been knocked out of Wimbledon this year, but that shouldn't keep the 29-year-old down for long. He's had multiple finals appearances in Grand Slams and won the US Open in 2021. He also made it to the quarterfinals at the 2020 Olympics as part of the Russian Olympic Committee. Of course, his $20.3 million earnings from last year should be a nice consolation prize, too. Medvedev has high-profile deals with video game brands EA Sports and Ubisoft, as a gamer himself, in addition to Lacoste, BMW, and Tecnifibre, which add up to $13 million, Forbes reported. He also earned $7.3 million in prize money last year. 6. Rafael Nadal Technically, Nadal isn't a tennis player anymore; he retired in 2024 at 38 years old and as one of three men who completed the career Golden Slam in men's singles (all four Grand Slam tournaments plus a gold medal at the Olympics). However, in the last full year of his career, he earned $23.3 million. While most of that ($23 million to be specific) came from off the court, we still have to pay respect to one of the GOATs of tennis. Especially one who has won over $120 million in prize money over the course of his career.

Forbes put her 2024 earnings at $26.7 million, with $11.7 million in winnings and $15 million from brand deals and other career endeavors. You might've seen her promoting Lancôme, On, Rolex, Visa, and Tecnifibre....","Wimbledon, one of four Grand Slam tennis tournaments, is underway. Some tennis players make tens of millions of dollars each year. Coco Gauff, Carlos Alcaraz, and Naomi Osaka were some of the highest-paid players in 2024. It's time to don your best tennis whites and sip a Pimm's Cup: Wimbledon is here. Wimbledon, the third Grand Slam tennis tournament, began on June 30 and wraps up on July 13. Some major players have already been eliminated from the tournament, including third-seed Alexander Zverev, ninth-seed Daniil Medvedev, and 12th-seed Frances Tiafoe for the men, and second- through-fifth-seeds Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini, and Zheng Qinwen for the women. In other words, it's anyone's game. Tennis is one of the biggest sports in the world, and according to Tennis.com, the number of players is only growing. There was a jump of nearly 2 million tennis players in the US from 2023 to 2024. While becoming a professional tennis player is grueling work, it can lead to huge paydays. Forbes ranked the highest-paid tennis players in the world in 2024, with earnings ranging from $13.7 million to an eye-popping $42.3 million. Here are the highest-earning tennis players in the world, and how they did it. Sabalenka, a 27-year-old champ from Belarus, was ranked the first seed at Wimbledon this year, and remains the only woman from the top five still in competition. She's also ranked No. 1 in the world by the WTA. Forbes reported Sabalenka earned a total of $13.7 million last year: $6.7 million in prize money and $7 million in sponsorships and other deals. Most recently, she won the 2024 US Open and the 2024 Australian Open. She also made it to the finals of the 2025 Australian Open and the 2025 French Open. Sabalenka, who has 3 million followers on Instagram, has partnerships with Wilson, Nike, and Audemars Piguet. Ruud skipped Wimbledon this year, though he was seeded at No. 15. He announced on June 21 that a knee injury was hindering his ability to play, per ESPN. The 26-year-old hails from Norway, and although he's never won a Grand Slam (he's been runner-up three times), he's still earned a pretty penny. Forbes estimated that he earned $13.9 million last year, with $10 million coming from off-the-court endeavors and $3.9 million from winnings. His biggest endorsements are Samsonite, Vitamin Well, watch brand Fleming, Yonex, and Varsity Headwear. Osaka, 27, has been one of the best-known tennis players in the world since her surprise 2018 US Open win over Serena Williams. In the years following, she's won another US Open and two Australian Opens. She also made it to the third round of Wimbledon for the first time since 2018 this year, though she was knocked out by Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova. Osaka, who was born in Japan, earned an estimated $14.6 million last year, and just $600,000 of that came from winnings, Forbes reported. The remaining $14 million came from off-the-court partnerships with Maybelline, Etsy, Nike, and her own media company, Hana Kumo. She also has an impressively loyal fan base of 2.8 million Instagram followers. Medvedev, who was seeded at No. 9, has already been knocked out of Wimbledon this year, but that shouldn't keep the 29-year-old down for long. He's had multiple finals appearances in Grand Slams and won the US Open in 2021. He also made it to the quarterfinals at the 2020 Olympics as part of the Russian Olympic Committee. Of course, his $20.3 million earnings from last year should be a nice consolation prize, too. Medvedev has high-profile deals with video game brands EA Sports and Ubisoft, as a gamer himself, in addition to Lacoste, BMW, and Tecnifibre, which add up to $13 million, Forbes reported. He also earned $7.3 million in prize money last year. Technically, Nadal isn't a tennis player anymore; he retired in 2024 at 38 years old and as one of three men who completed the career Golden Slam in men's singles (all four Grand Slam tournaments plus a gold medal at the Olympics). However, in the last full year of his career, he earned $23.3 million. While most of that ($23 million to be specific) came from off the court, we still have to pay respect to one of the GOATs of tennis. Especially one who has won over $120 million in prize money over the course of his career. Nadal's brand partnerships include Kia, Louis Vuitton, Nike, and the sports app Playtomic. Sinner, 23, is the No. 1 seed for Wimbledon this year and is still in competition for the win. In 2025, he won the Australian Open (which he also won in 2024) and was in the finals of the French Open. Sinner is also ranked No. 1 by ATP, the governing body of men's tennis. The Italian player, per Forbes, earned $26.6 million last year: $11.6 million in winnings and $15 million from other streams of income. A quick look at his Instagram feed tells us he has partnerships with Nike, the skincare brand La Roche Posay, Lavazza, and Gucci. Swiatek, 24, is currently ranked No. 4 in the world by the WTA, and was seeded eighth at Wimbledon, where she is still in contention to win. In addition to being the first Polish tennis player to win a singles title, she's won four of the seven French Opens she's competed in. She also won the US Open in 2022.

mov_135F6C2C030CCD196BCBB9A662483D98,"  Today the Prime Day deals are finally live, meaning it's time to lock in on which products I need this summer. Of course, it wouldn't be a true Amazon haul if it weren't for the best Prime Day beauty deals. Some of my desert island items are on sale across skincare, sunscreen, makeup, and haircare. Today, savvy shoppers can save on everything from luxury serums by Sunday Riley to everyday items like shampoo, lip balm, and pimple patches. Prime Day is a big opportunity for K-beauty fans like myself, with deals on popular Korean skincare. My favorite lip balm is Laneige's Glowy Lip Balm, so I'm stocking up while it's $5 off in the shade ""Berry."" COSRX also has a Prime Day beauty deal on its best-selling Snail Mucin Essence for nearly half off. Amid this hot weather, there are hot deals hot styling tools. Today, the notoriously expensive Dyson Supersonic Origin hair dryer is on sale for $80 off. Every woman I know who owns a Supersonic agrees it is by far the best hair dryer they've ever used. I've had my own Dyson hair dryer for over 3 years, and there's truly nothing quite like it. The award-winning daily face wash with cold-pressed antioxidants to remove makeup, prevent buildup in pores, and support pH balance. Compact in size, the Laneige Lip Glowy Balm is great to bring on the go. It offers all-day hydration and a slight glossy sheen. Cure your whiteheads overnight with this 36-pack of hydrocolloid pore-cleansing stickers. This extremely hydrating 2-in-1 toner and moisturizer is a must for a complete skincare routine. Its gentle formula helps your skin feel more smooth and plump. The Cosrx Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence uses snail mucin to repair and fortify your complexion. A dense, rich moisturizing cream that's safe for dry, sensitive skin. It's meant to help boost your skin barrier so you're protected from pollutants. Behold — a beauty editor's holy grail. This is one of the best, most effective vitamin C serums on the market, infused with cold-pressed ingredients to give your skin a natural, healthy glow. The Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask is like a lip balm version of the brand's cult-favorite Water Sleeping Mask. It deeply nourishes the lips and smells delicious. There's not one, but eight types of hyaluronic acid in this sunscreen to pull moisture into your skin. Another unique feature is the color-correcting green tint, which helps to counteract redness and even out your skin tone. Wear this yummy serum-infused lip tint on its own, or as a topper with your favorite lip combo. The donut-shaped applicator helps it glide on smoothly. This hair oil provides intense hydration and nourishment for dry, frizzy hair. Known for hydrating skin and refreshing makeup, the Mario Badescu Facial Spray is made with aloe, herbs, and rosewater, and is suitable for all skin types. You can use it at a toner after cleansing or as a refresher for makeup. If you're a beginner to skincare, this serum is a great place to start. It contains vitamin C to brighten skin and hyaluronic acid to lock in moisture. Prime Day is and ideal moment to save on an otherwise-too-expensive hair styling tool. Our expert beauty reporters have tested several of the best blow dryer brushes and best hair dryers that are on sale today, so you can achieve a DIY blowout for less.

Almost half (40%) spend their points over the festive** season, which means that many Brits are already starting to save for an extra treat for themselves or a gift for a loved one this December.

This group includes value-savvy parents who redeem their points on baby items.

n2n0hxk,"  Yes it's one of the newer filters that protects into Ultra long UVA 1, but not the only one, in fact uvmune stops short of protecting into visible light, which has been known to cause hyperpigmentation in people. Now if you get the tinted one, it will begin to protect you against visible light, but the tints are way too deep for me, and many people, I'm very pale and the tinted is too dark, and the unintended actually give me a yellow jaundice tint to my face. I know a lot of fair skinned people that prefer sunscreens that have tinosorb M instead. Tinosorb M protects against uvb, UVA 1 and 2, and into Ultra long UV as well as visible light. The one drawback? It's a white powder similar to zinc oxide and even in nano form, it can leave a slight very faint white cast. So deeper skin tones and those individuals with beards can get some white cast similar to a mineral sunscreen. Just like with the uvmune, there are tinted sunscreens that contain tinosorb m. So I would say no, it is not the gold standard by any means, tinosorb M has been out for a while now and actually protects throughout the entire spectrum including visible light which the untinted uvmune does not, unless you get the tinted one with iron oxide in it. It's definitely an awesome new tool for chemists to have in their tool belts when creating sunscreens although as of right now L'Oreal has the patent on it so only their sunscreens will be using this filter for now. As a very fair stand individual, I personally prefer p20 kids which contains two new filters that protect throughout the entire spectrum (tinosorb A2B, and tinosorb M). I love that this sunscreen has been tested for 3 hours water resistance and up to 10 hours out of water. So it depends what your needs are if you are not pasty pale, or have deeper skin tones or a beard, uvmune will a more appealing option. And as of recently, the European Union has just added a brand new filter that also protects against ultra long UVA that won't be patented by L'Oreal but it's not on the market yet, maybe next year. Avene has their own patented new filter known as triasorb ... Similarly to tinosorb m, it protects throughout the entire UV spectrum including visible light.
