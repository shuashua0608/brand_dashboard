And yet, SPF is often too greasy to use every day, not to mention it can be shiny on skin, unruly under makeup, and stain clothes. What are the sunscreens doctors themselves use, we wondered, with clean-feeling formulations light enough for everyday wear? We reached out to skincare experts, specifically dermatologists and plastic surgeons for their recommendations, and their picks are simple to use, easy to find, and seriously effective. The best sunscreen is the one you'll actually wear, so here are nine doctor-recommended sunscreens you can blend easily into your daily routine. Best Dermatologist-Recommended Sunscreens Skinceuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF 50 Credit: Skinceuticals The most effective sunscreen for you is one you'll reach for time and again. For Dr. Don Yoo, a board-certified facial plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, Calif., it's the Skinceuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF 50. “For daily use, what I look for in a sunscreen is broad-spectrum protection in a non-comedogenic mineral base. Since I tend to have sensitive skin, I prefer sunscreens with a mineral base, but with a finish that feels clean on the skin with no white cast or heaviness.” He loves this Skinceuticals pick as it's “100 percent mineral” but blends in “smoothly without leaving a residue,” he said. La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-in Milk Sunscreen SPF 60 Credit: Amazon The sunscreen format you choose each day may vary with the activities your day holds. While his preference for daily-wear sunscreen is mineral, Dr. Yoo—an avid golfer—prefers a chemical sunscreen when he hits the links. “My current go-to is La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-in Milk Sunscreen SPF 60, as it provides long-lasting broad-spectrum coverage with 80 minutes of water resistance in a light, non-greasy finish that leaves no white cast and does not sting even when it gets into my eyes.” Eucerin Sun Sensitive Mineral Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 Credit: Amazon Though mineral sunscreens are the gold standard, the zinc oxide and titanium dioxide they contain can leave behind a chalky, white residue, especially on melanated skin. For mineral-based coverage that's also sheer, Dr. Ha Linh Vu, a board-certified dermatologist with Dermatology Partners in Philadelphia, Pa., swears by the affordable drugstore brand Eucerin. “My personal favorite daily SPF is the Eucerin Sun Sensitive Mineral Sunscreen,” Dr. Vu said. “I like that it is not too liquidy, so it does not run too much when you apply it. It also rubs in nicely without leaving a white cast, working well even on darker skin tones.” TiZO2 Non-Tinted Facial Mineral Sunscreen and Primer SPF 40 Credit: Amazon Another favorite of Dr. Vu's is TiZO2 Non-Tinted Facial Mineral Sunscreen and Primer. “I like this for all of the same reasons as the Eucerin sunscreen. In addition, it has a nice matte finish, so [it's] great for hotter days and for use as a primer,” she said. “The smaller size also makes it perfect for travel use. It comes in a tinted version that is great if you want protection from visible light, or to use it as a light foundation.” Isdin Eryfotona Actinica Zinc Oxide Broad Spectrum SPF 50+ Credit: Amazon Dr. Maya Thosani, a board-certified dermatologist with Modern Dermatology in Scottsdale, Ariz., is a noted fan of dual-action sunscreens, which not only protect from UVA and UVB rays, but also pamper skin with nourishing goodies to help reverse existing UV damage. For head-to-toe protection each day, she trusts Isdin's Eryfotona Actinica Zinc Oxide Broad Spectrum SPF 50+. “I absolutely love this for how lightweight it goes on being a purely mineral sunscreen,” Dr. Thosani said. “This is a double-action sunscreen, is cosmetically elegant, and appreciated by women in its tinted version—and they have an untinted one that men love.” Making it an even better value, Dr. Thosani points out, the bottle design allows for all the product to be used, down to the very last UV-filtering drop.

mov_517D015024D32B26DBC0B04A5F9D7692,"  Mumbai: Harindarpal Singh Banga, along with Indra Banga, will sell a 2.1% stake worth $140.3 million (approximately ₹1,200 crore) in beauty and personal care company Nykaa through a block deal, according to a term sheet accessed by Mint. The Bangas, among Nykaa's earliest investors, are offloading about 60 million shares at an offer price of ₹200 per share, a 5.5% discount to the latest closing price, the term sheet showed. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are managing the transaction. Banga, Nykaa, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to Mint's requests for comment. Banga, a commodities billionaire and chairman of Hong Kong-based Caravel Group, held an 8.7% stake in Nykaa before it listed in 2021. The Nayar family, who founded the company, still owns 52% and has not sold any shares since the IPO. This latest sale comes nearly a year after Banga divested over four crore shares—amounting to a 1.43% stake—at ₹208.30 apiece in August 2024, netting ₹851.5 crore. Following that transaction, his holding fell from 6.40% to 4.97%. For the quarter ended 31 March, Nykaa reported a near three-fold jump in consolidated net profit to ₹20.28 crore from ₹6.93 crore a year earlier. Revenue from operations rose 23.61% to ₹2,061.76 crore from ₹1,667.98 crore in FY24. Over the past year, the company has launched a record number of global beauty brands, forging partnerships with Yves Saint Laurent, NARS, Kerastase, Eucerin, GHD, Armani Beauty, Supergoop, and Nexxus, among others. Nykaa is now shifting toward a more profitable growth trajectory, aiming for mid-20% annual growth in its beauty and personal care (BPC) business over the next five years. The strategy includes deeper market penetration, premiumization, and enhanced convenience. The company plans to scale its physical footprint across tier 2 and 3 cities, increasing store count from 237 to over 500 by FY30. It is also investing heavily in regional influencer marketing, working with over 28,000 influencers to drive discovery. To improve delivery speeds, Nykaa is ramping up its logistics infrastructure. Its two-hour fulfilment model, 'Nykaa Now', is live in seven metros. This is supported by a network of 44 warehouses and 40+ rapid hubs, enabling same- or next-day delivery in key cities.","Mumbai: Harindarpal Singh Banga, along with Indra Banga, will sell a 2.1% stake worth $140.3 million (approximately ₹1,200 crore) in beauty and personal care company Nykaa through a block deal, according to a term sheet accessed by Mint.

These are way more flexible, come in gorgeous summery patterns, and will actually stay on longer than it takes you to pick up coffee at Dunkin'. Promising review: ""These are SO cute and stay on for a long time! I've never really been a fan of plastic bandages, so these are my go-to when I'm looking for cloth Band-Aids."" —Jess Get a box of 30 from Amazon for $7.20. 2. A duo of Aquaphor Lip Repair tubes because I'm sure I'm not the only one suffering from extremely chapped lips. It's fragrance-and-paraben-free and filled with soothing shea butter and chamomile essence that'll help heal your lips in time for your next date night. Promising review: ""One of the best lip balms I've ever used. I love to sleep with it and wake up with my lips completely renewed. Highly recommended."" —Cintia Gomes Get a pack of two from Amazon for $8.36. 3. A low-profile under-the-cabinet banana hanger you'll, for lack of a better term, go *bananas* over when you see 1. how easy it is to install (it literally just sticks on with a strong adhesive) and 2. how much room you suddenly have on your counter without your go-to breakfast taking up residence. Check out a TikTok of the banana hanger in action. Promising review: ""I recently purchased this folding banana hook hanger, and it has been a great addition to my kitchen! The design is clever and space-saving, allowing me to easily fold it away when not in use. It keeps my bananas fresh and prevents them from bruising, which is a big plus. The hanger is sturdy and well-made, ensuring it can hold a bunch of bananas without any issues. Highly recommend for anyone looking to organize their kitchen and keep their fruit in great condition!"" —Challas Gordman Get it from Amazon for $6.79 (available in five colors and in packs of two). 4. A Dreo oscillating tower fan with six (!!!) speeds you can aim directly at yourself to ensure your always-too-hot body is kept at the epitome of comfort at all times.

BuzzFeed editor Jenae Sitzes swears by this fan, she said, ""I have this exact tower fan, and as someone who doesn't have an AC in her bedroom (because it's a fire escape window), LET ME TELL YOU: It comes in clutch. And not only in the summer, but year-round — in the winter, this thing keeps us from burning up once our ~overzealous~ radiator kicks on (New Yorkers know). So yeah, our Dreo fan works pretty much 365 days a year and has been going strong since summer 2023. It has six speeds, though I only need to kick it up to full blast occasionally. It keeps me cool at night, it's quiet, and the night mode is super handy because it turns off the LED display quickly if you need to adjust the speed during the night. You can mute the little beeping sounds with the remote too if needed."" Promising review: ""This fan saved my life. I like the noise, but it's not too loud. It's perfect for the slight white noise. The power is great! I usually keep it on settings 1–3 because I like the lower blo,w but level 5 is powerful and will keep you cool. It's so cool when connected to Alexa.

Investment banks Goldman Sachs (India) Securities and JP Morgan India were reportedly appointed as placement agents for the deal. Shares of FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd, the parent company of beauty and fashion retailer Nykaa, slipped sharply on Thursday, weighed down by a large block deal involving one of its early investors. The stock fell nearly 5 percent in early trade, touching an intraday low of around Rs 201 on the NSE, amid heightened selling pressure on the bourses. As per media reports, Harindarpal Singh Banga along with Indra Banga, offloaded approximately six crore shares in the company through bulk transactions. The deal was executed at a floor price of Rs 200 per share, which is around around 5 percent below Wednesday's closing price of Rs 211.59—triggering a swift reaction from investors. The total value of the transaction is estimated to be in the range of Rs 1,200 crore, as per multiple media reports. Investment banks Goldman Sachs (India) Securities and JP Morgan India were reportedly appointed as placement agents for the deal. Harindarpal Singh Banga, the founder of the Hong Kong-based Caravel Group, held an 8.7 per cent stake in Nykaa prior to the company's stock market debut in 2021. The Nayar family, who established the brand, continues to hold a controlling stake of 52 per cent and has not divested any shares since the IPO. This recent sale follows a similar move nearly a year ago, when Banga sold four crore shares—equivalent to a 1.43 per cent stake—at a price of Rs 208.30 per share in August. That transaction reduced his ownership from 6.40% to 4.97%. Robust financial results Despite Thursday's share price drop, Nykaa has posted solid financial performance in recent quarters. The company reported a three-fold jump in net profit for the March quarter, which rose to Rs 20 crore. For the full financial year, net profit more than doubled to Rs 66 crore, underpinned by continued strength in its beauty and personal care verticals. Expansion plans on track Over the last one year, Nykaa has introduced an unprecedented number of international beauty labels to the Indian market through new partnerships with globally renowned names such as Yves Saint Laurent, NARS, Kerastase, Eucerin, GHD, Armani Beauty, Supergoop, and Nexxus, among others. As it enters its next phase of expansion, the company is focused on driving sustainable profitability. It is targeting a mid-20 percent compound annual growth rate in its beauty and personal care (BPC) segment over the next five years. In parallel, Nykaa is looking to strengthen its offline footprint by scaling up its presence in tier 2 and tier 3 cities.

But Let's Get Back to Prime Day  Before you start shopping, make a plan. Our philosophy when it comes to major shopping events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon Prime Day is to first consider what you need and make a list. If you don't have a plan, you could end up buying things you really don't need. Think about what you regularly shop for: snacks for the kids, batteries, cleaning supplies, etc. Then look around your house and see if you need bigger items like kitchen appliances or a new vacuum cleaner. Do the kids need anything? Outdoor toys, sports equipment, crafting kits, clothes, and back-to-school supplies come to mind. Maybe you have a wedding shower or birthday party that you need gifts for—this is a good time to score what they want at a savings.

mov_650858BD98F0280FBFFC4D033651C378,"  This $10 version of Glossier's beloved $78 scent will have you smelling like a fairytale. 1. A tinted lip balm that's eerily close to the same magic as ""Black Honey,"" TikTok's beloved $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique, that it will genuinely startle you — especially when you see the price. This is a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lippie that's just a step above the ""no makeup makeup"" look, giving the perfect subtly polished effect. I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference! Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (also available in the pink honey version, and in a two-pack that mixes both!) . 2. Gold Bond's firming neck and chest cream your skin will be SO happy to soak up — this is formulated with aloe, salicylic acid, and jojoba oil to help hydrate, tighten, and gently exfoliate your skin so effectively that you should be able to see early results in two weeks. (For some reviewers, it only took a few days!) Promising review: ""I am a lotion user every single day. I use face moisturizers that I love. I am over the moon how good this is. I mainly use it on my neck, hands and forearms. The difference is amazing. My skin actually feels so good. I wish I could but larger containers of it."" —Kimberly P. Get it from Amazon for $11.19. 3. A travel-friendly SPF 50 Airy Sunstick Smoothing Bar, a K-beauty staple with a curved balm stick style that makes it super easy to apply, and a nonsticky, white cast–free formula that plays ABSURDLY well with makeup. If you're looking for a lightweight ""soft matte"" sunscreen to protect your skin, this is your new BFF. Check out a TikTok of the Airy Sunstick Smoothing Bar in action. Note that the AAD recommends using at least SPF 30 and reapplying as needed for skin protection. You can read about sunscreen myths and facts from dermatologists for more information! Promising review: ""NO WHITE CAST! I've been looking for a stick sunscreen and this was just exactly what was needed!! I'm a medium-toned Black woman and looking for something without a white cast is always a challenge. I have applied it on my bare skin and there isn't a white cast at all!

mov_B58F2493E0835F8513A519F3C794AE3D,"  This blurring powder is basically pure witchcraft and your *best* weapon against heat and humidity. And no, it's not the $59 Givenchy version. 1. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder, which is SO GOOD at eliminating shine and blurring pores that I feel like it'd smirk at you and go, ""How 'bout that, huh? "" if it had a human form. If you dread summer because you love wearing makeup but the heat and humidity leave it looking patchy, this'll lock it in with a smooth, semi-matte finish. Your oily T-zone doesn't know what's coming for it. One reviewer compares this to a $59 Givenchy powder! Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""This is the secret for makeup in hot and humid climates! I am a sweaty person, but I also love wearing makeup regardless of the weather. While holidaying in Southeast Asia at the start of wet season, I faced temperatures between 35 and 40 degrees Celsius (95–104 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity. After finishing my base makeup, I applied this powder all over. I did not use a setting spray because most break me out. Luckily, no setting spray was necessary while using this setting powder! It kept my foundation and cream blush from separating or becoming patchy, and also kept me from being too shiny. I reapplied a couple of times per day. This is magical and I will definitely be using regularly during the summers in North America too!"" —Sara Lima Get it from Amazon for $25. 2. A smocked midi dress because Hill House's Nap Dress is truly ~dreamy~ but your bank account is like, ""Um, we still need to buy groceries."" This cutie's a fraction of the cost and just as gorgeous, not to mention breathable as heck thanks to its 100% organic cotton poplin fabric. Prepare to fall head over heels for this dress — I definitely did. I recently wore this dress (in shade Lipstick Pink) to an outdoor wedding and I. AM. OBSESSED. It hugs my frame beautifully with the stretchy smocked waist — I can even get away with not wearing a bra, though for context I'm a B cup — and the flowy bottom of the dress sits just right. I personally haven't tried Hill House's Nap Dress (I drool over the designs, but $178 is a little too steep for me), but I'm perfectly happy to stock up on this dress in a few colors for around the same price. My colleague Heather Braga, on the other hand, is a Hill House devotee — but even she was impressed by this cheaper option: ""Listen, I am the proud owner of NINE Hill House Nap Dresses. I condone splurging on them (truly, by all means) and will be the first to tell you they are worth every penny. That being said, I tried out one of these from Quince and LOVE it. I have the Tribeca Stripe pattern and cannot believe how similar it feels to the other brand. It's my current go-to style for my frame (two kids in two years, send prayers) and is one of the few things I know I can throw on and KNOW I look great. Will definitely add another to an upcoming order and have been shouting from the rooftops how wonderful this brand fits."" Get it from Quince for $69.90 (available in sizes XS–XL and nine styles). 3. E.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen if you're still trying to find a daily sunscreen you don't despise. This clear gel sunscreen offers SPF 35 and goes on so smooth and lightweight, you'll immediately forget you're wearing it — no white cast here, folks. It doubles as a blurring primer, so it's great for wearing under makeup too! If you love Supergoop but the price is becoming hard to swallow...may I suggest trying this, because it's *very* similar. The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop's cult-fave product end. I've tried both, and I honestly prefer this E.l.f. version. Supergoop's had a slight graininess to it that I didn't love, while this E.l.f. sunscreen is exactly what I'd hoped Supergoop's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top!...","This blurring powder is basically pure witchcraft and your *best* weapon against heat and humidity.

For the last few weeks, I have been combing through thousands of beauty deals, and have come out the other side with the 59 best skin care, makeup, body care, and hair care must-haves you should shop before the sale ends. The lowest prices begin with a $4 body exfoliating brush that I consider necessary for smooth summer skin, and on the most expensive side, Shark's rarely-on-sale hair styler (which I've never seen this cheap before). You'll also find under-the-radar picks (Dearcloud's serum blush), top-rated products (L'Oreal's Lumi Glotion skin enhancer), celebrity-used favorites (Laura Geller's baked foundation), my go-tos (Medicube's exosome serum), and much more. Best Deals Overall It was hard enough to pare this list down to 59 products, and even more difficult to single out the nine best, but here they are.

CeraVe's Skin Renewing Anti-Aging Retinol Serum is a great choice because when it comes time for a restock, at $23, it's still a steal. The titular retinol is a wrinkle-reducing, dark spot-fading, and skin-firming powerhouse. It's complemented by a trio of plumping ceramides and ultra-hydrating hyaluronic acid.

Equally multitasking stars like Bethenny Frankel rave about the stuff, now available in a jumbo value version exclusively at Nordstrom. “I am partial to the original one because it makes me feel like I'm in a botanical spa,” Frankel said on TikTok, naming it one of the “expensive” items she deems “worth it.” Nordstrom Emily Ratajkowski called these pre-packaged peels “the best for exfoliating your skin” in a recent W interview, admitting she'd skipped the skincare step before. “I've noticed a huge improvement in the texture and tonal quality of my skin,” she raved. Nordstrom If splurging doesn't scare you, there's also an unheard-of deal on a set featuring the brand's SpectraLite FaceWare Pro mask. (It's like getting peel pads, blurring cream and a lip treatment for free.) “I would die for it,” DeSorbo raved of the red- and blue light-powered mask in an Amazon Live. “I truly think it is one of the only LED masks I've ever used that actually works.” Pro tip: Sets like this have been among the first to sell out in previous years, so we'd recommend snapping this one up fast. Nordstrom From famous faces to Page Six staffers, plenty of beauty experts swear by NuFace. Tay Lautner told us the “super user-friendly” device is one of her “favorite things to use to help lift, plump and smooth [her] skin before an event,” while Kate Hudson raved about the brand to Mindbodygreen. “When I do the NuFace every day, I feel a huge difference in my skin,” she told the outlet. I was not expecting that because I always think those things feel gimmicky, but they really work.” Our very own managing editor, Alexandra D'Aluisio, is also a fan: “Nicola Coughlan used the NuFace Trinity+ in a Vogue “Beauty Secrets” video … she even insisted she knew when she 'went ham' on the product because her 'cheekbones were cheekboning' in certain scenes,” she says. “That was enough to convince me to buy, and I've been trying to use it at least three times a week ever since.” Nordstrom Sabrina Carpenter can do a lot with 15 minutes — but applying her signature blush will only take you a matter of seconds. The star's long worked with makeup artist Carolina Gonzalez, who told us she applies the blendable formula on the mid-apples of the pop phenom's cheeks. “When you start on the cheekbone and go up from there, it gives you more of a lifted and snatched look,” Gonzalez explained. Nordstrom Love the Longchamp Le Pliage totes stars and royals like Kate Middleton have carried? In addition to a full-size version, the sale also includes this adorable mini makeup bag. Nordstrom Plenty of superstars stock up on Supergoop! , from Brooke Shields and Jessica Chastain to Christie Brinkley.

So many stars use 111Skin, it just might be easier to name A-listers who haven't raved about the brand.

Page Six Style & Shopping Editor Elana Fishman is also impressed with the products, saying of the rose gold mask included in this set, “I slapped on this mask the morning of a video shoot, hoping it'd help me look my best on camera — and boy, did it live up to the hype.” Nordstrom...","Page Six may be compensated and/or receive an affiliate commission if you click or buy through our links. Featured pricing is subject to change. Nordstrom understands the beauty of a great deal. During the department store's much-awaited Anniversary Sale, hundreds of beauty sets are up for grabs — including exclusives from hardly-ever-on-sale luxury brands like La Mer, Augustinus Bader and Dr. Dennis Gross. Page Six's Picks While deals are already available for Nordstrom Icon cardholders, they open to the brand's Ambassador tier on July 9, followed by Influencers and the general public on July 10 and 12, respectively. Below, start shopping (or curating your wishlist) with our roundup of the best celebrity-approved beauty buys — but act fast, as the most popular products tend to sell out long before the sale ends on August 4. Nordstrom La Mer's products are famously pricey, but stars like Jennifer Lopez, Kate Hudson and Selena Gomez swear they're worth it. Right now, Nordstrom's offering a rare opportunity to bag the luxury line's signature Créme de La Mer for less, along with several other mini must-haves. Nordstrom Want to smell like a star?

mov_91795B7876F9B5E21709A90BF6E8D425,"  Kaitlyn McLintock wearing Wonderskin's Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain I love shopping on Amazon. Blame it on the huge selection, speedy shipping, and simple return process, but let's just say I put my Prime account to good use—especially when it comes to beauty products. Whether it's a TikTok-viral lip stain or a cult-classic Korean essence, I've placed more orders in the last year than I'd like to admit. At the time, it was bad news for my bank account, but now, it's good news for you because I know which Amazon beauty products are actually worth ordering, and right in time for Prime Day, too. This year, Prime Day deals are happening from July 8 to 11. During the sale, Prime members can score big discounts on thousands of products, including the best of the beauty category. Excited? Me too. Keep scrolling to see my official, beauty editor–approved shopping guide. Wonderskin Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain - Adore I have to start with a product I use almost every single day—Wonderskin's Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain. It went viral on TikTok a few months ago, and once I tested it, I could see why. Apply the dark-blue liquid to the lips (don't worry—it doesn't stay that way), wait a few minutes to let it dry, and peel it off. You'll be left with the most stunning, long-lasting lip color. You can stop there, or you can apply lip gloss over the top. I prefer the latter. It's become my go-to lip combo. Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water I can't tell you how many makeup artists and skincare experts have recommended Bioderma's Sensibio H2O Micellar Water to me. The classic French pharmacy product quickly and easily dissolves makeup, cleansing the skin without leaving behind even a hint of redness or irritation. Bondi Sands Self Tanning Foam Behold! The only self-tanner I've used consistently for over five years—Bondi Sands' Self Tanning Foam in Dark. It doesn't streak. It doesn't smell. It also features a bronze guide color, allowing you to see exactly where you're placing it and where you need to blend. I wear it overnight, and by the next morning, I have natural-looking, sun-kissed limbs. COLOR WOW Dream Coat Supernatural Spray I've always wondered how celebrities like Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian get such glossy hair on the red carpet. Well, as it turns out, the answer is Color Wow's Dream Coat Supernatural Spray. Read my full review to learn why it's such an underrated gem. COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence Snail mucin is the ultimate glass-skin ingredient. It's moisturizing, antioxidant-rich, and anti-inflammatory, so no wonder this iconic snail mucin essence blew up on the internet. It's the key to firm, bouncy, dewy skin. Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey Clinique's Almost Lipstick in Black Honey is so good. It was *the* lipstick for '90s starlets and supermodels. Everyone from Drew Barrymore to Courteney Cox and Julia Roberts wore it in the decade of slip dresses, grunge music, and mood rings. Cut to modern day, and it's still as beloved as ever. It recently had a resurgence on TikTokafter Gen Z became aware of its sheer formula and unique and universally flattering raisin-esque color. divi Scalp Serum...","Kaitlyn McLintock wearing Wonderskin's Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain I love shopping on Amazon.

Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. Dawn Platinum Plus Powerwash dish spray (30% off list price) Dawn foaming dish spray works superbly and most professional cleaners will tell you that you can use it to clean more than dishes. Grab this household staple plus refills in this sale, and you probably won't buy dish soap again for the rest of 2025. A Simple Modern EVA beach tote (30% off list price) You may have coveted the Bogg Bag, a roomy and boxy tote made from rubber, so it's perfect for nearly every excursion and purpose. Simple Modern (maker of the beloved tumblers) has created a much more affordable and highly-rated version constructed that has a similar Croc-like design and easy-clean fabrication. Available in three sizes and tons of colors, the Simple Modern tote has fold-flat handles and comes with a detachable and water-resistant zipper pocket for holding smaller devices like phones and keys. Clinique Almost Lipstick tinted lip balm (30% off list price) Beauty lovers know that this perfectly hued beauty product is the end-all be-all of lip balms. It's available in Black Honey and Pink Honey shades, though Black Honey is a cult-favorite lip color that is considered universally flattering and has been popular since the early aughts. This semi-glossy balm is perfect for everyday wear and rarely goes on sale. Aquaphor itch relief ointment two-pack (30% off list price) Aquaphor's itch relief ointment for kids can be used on children ages two and up to soothe itchy patches of eczema, rashes, psoriasis and more. It's made with 1% hydrocortisone, and an absolute must as we approach the summer months, when insect bites abound and contact with poison ivy is a possibility. This is the first time this two-pack has been available for under $10 and featured during Prime Day. Away Bigger carry-on luggage (20% off list price) The Bigger carry-on is what put Away on the map. It fits an astonishing amount of clothing while still complying with carry-on regulations for most major airlines. It's a game-changer for people who never want to check a bag. Like all of Away's suitcases, it's made with durable, water-repellent and lightweight materials and 360-degree wheels that glide with ease. The adjustable trolley handle has two height settings, while the interior compression pad system and organizer makes it easy to load up on clothing. It also comes with a water-repellent laundry bag. It's available in seven colors. Scrub Daddy and Scrub Mommy 8-pack (20% off list price) Scrub Daddys and Scrub Mommys are beloved by cleaning enthusiasts, plus they come in fun colors. They stay firm in colder water for heavy-duty scrubbing and soften when exposed to warm water. You can even use them on stainless steel and cast iron, as they are scratch-free. Clean up after yourself without having to break a sweat thanks to these effective little dudes. This is the first time this pack is on sale during Prime Day and the lowest price of the year. Bag Balm moisturizer (41% off list price) This cult-favorite occlusive moisturizer is a permanent mainstay on my nightstand for how well it protects and nourishes the cracked, dry skin on my hands, face, lids and lips. New York-based dermatologist Dr. Marisa Garshick previously recommended using an occlusive product such as Bag Balm. ""For any areas of dry, cracked skin, it can help to use a thicker cream or petrolatum-containing ointment to provide an occlusive barrier to lock moisture in and protect the skin from external irritants,"" she said. This is the first time Bag Balm has been on sale during Prime Day. L'Oreal Lumi Le Glass highlighter stick (33% off list price) L'Oreal's newest highlighter stick debuted earlier this year, and it hasn't been drastically discounted until right now.

It is buildable and has a light texture that melts into the skin without feeling sticky or greasy. Tineco iFloor One cordless wet and dry vacuum mop (40% off list price) This wildly convenient vacuum-mop floor cleaner by Tineco has the suction power to deliver an immediate and streak-free clean with its mop head roller.

mov_5A4DEBA3C3502A1809F4B7D2F8F2EDF7,"  It's not every day that I'm willingly spend money on beauty products. That is, until Amazon Prime Day rolls around. As a beauty editor, my desk is consistently stacked high with boxes of products vying for a chance to be tried and praised, but few things beat the tubes and jars I've trusted for years. Because I'm a bit spoiled by free products, I find it hard to splash out on my favorites when I'm running low—but when they're slashed by as much as 50% during Prime Day, which runs from July 8 to 11, I'll never hesitate to hit purchase. To access these steep discounts while they last, you'll need to sign up for an Amazon Prime membership, which is free for 30 days before charging a monthly fee. From there, you can reap the benefits of on-sale luxury and drugstore beauty, along with the fashion must-haves, home décor findings, and more that Who What Wear editors have meticulously selected. Below, the Amazon beauty products that I buy on repeat (starting at just $4!) from brands such as Kiehl's, Laneige, Supergoop! , and more—plus a few big-ticket items I'd recommend snagging now that they're on sale. Editor-Approved Beauty Deals Under $30 Dr.Althea 345 Relief Cream Daily Face Moisturizer Of all the facial moisturizers I own, I never travel anywhere without the Dr.Althea 345 Relief Cream. I love this soothing cream for its niacinamide-forward formula, which helps quell my rosacea-induced redness, while hyaluronic acid and ceramides help hydrate the skin and lock in moisture. Plus, its squeeze-tube bottle makes it easily portable, which is why I never hesitate to hit buy when I spot it on sale. Wonderskin Wonder Blading Lip Stain Peel Off Masque I, along with the rest of the Who What Wear beauty team, fell in love with this best-selling viral lip stain from Amazon this year: the Wonderskin Wonder Blading Lip Stain that sent TikTok into a tizzy. All you do is let the dark formula sit for 10 to 30 seconds like a mask (I like to apply it like lip liner) before wiping it off with a damp towel for a tint that lasts for hours. Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Speaking of peeling things off, there's never been a better time to stock up on Hero's original pimple patches than while they're on sale for just $10. These hydrocolloid stickers work overnight to zap zits and whiteheads after just one use—no picking or popping necessary. I keep these patches in my medicine cabinet and pack a sheet in every carry-on for the inevitable travel-induced breakouts. Nécessaire The Body Wash Crowned one of our very favorite bodywashes this year, the Nécessaire The Body Wash is a necessity (get it?) for several reasons. It's made with a vitamin-rich formula that supports hydration, even skin tones, and smoother texture, and its gentle scent doesn't bother any of our beauty editors—even those of us with sensitive skin. Now, you can nab any scent for just $21. Briogeo Style + Treat Yuzu + Plum Oil Sleek Stick I, along with everyone else who favors a bad-hair-day updo, have a lot of love for the sleek, slicked-back bun. However, there were always stray hairs and breakage poking up at my hairline—that is until the Briogeo Sleek Stick came into my life. While other wax sticks at Amazon would take multiple washes to actually get out of my hair, this non-greasy, never-damaging wax offers a smooth, glossy finish that makes my strands feel soft and washes like a breeze, no scrubbing required. Oh, and did I mention it's a Who What Wear Beauty Award winner? Supergoop! Glowscreen SPF 40 I likely need not introduce you to the Supergoop! Glowscreen, but I do need to inform you that it's on sale and ripe for the taking. This radiant, tone-evening sunscreen offers a lit-from-within glow while smoothing your skin into a filter-like veil; its formula is pumped full of SPF 40 and hyaluronic acid for an extra dose of protection. It's not only a favorite tinted sunscreen, but it's a top-notch makeup primer, too. Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara The Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara from Essence was already a steal at just $5 full-price, but at its Prime Day rate, buying a tube almost feels illegal. My fellow beauty editors have waxed poetic about this inexpensive formula for its impressive lengthening and curl-preserving powers, and I've personally bought this tube twice in the past year. No really, you need it. Shop More Editor Recommendations L'Oréal Paris True Match Lumi Glotion...","It's not every day that I'm willingly spend money on beauty products.

The Best Overall Beauty Deals at Amazon Prime Day Amazon Prime Day at a Glance Best Skincare Deals at Amazon Prime Day Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Spf 50 (Was $38) While technically this is a facial sunscreen, it doubles as a makeup primer that can be used anytime, anywhere. Katherine J.

Embryolisse Embryolisse Lait-Crème Concentré (Was $29) Another French beauty staple, this moisturizer will have your skin feeling baby soft and smooth in no time. It's a rich cream that deeply nourishes the skin, without feeling too heavy or leaving behind any greasiness. Kiehl's Avocado Eye Treatment (Was $38) This is one of the best eye creams for dryness, so it's not a bad idea to stock up before the fall.

mov_FF01CBB2B88BCD4A1ED6B768510483A4,"  Current Issue — Most Popular — Good sun habits. Sunscreen is a product people are constantly reminded to wear every single day. And for good reason: protecting your skin from the sun's ultraviolet rays—UVA, which causes premature aging, and UVB, which leads to sunburn and can contribute to skin cancer. But that doesn't mean it has to feel like a chore—especially when the right formula doubles as a makeup primer or hydrating lotion. Here are the best sunscreens to slot into your routine and keep you sun-safe (and glowing) all summer long. No matter which one you choose, don't forget to apply it properly: use a nickel-sized dollop or follow the two-finger rule to ensure your face and neck get the coverage they need. Apply 15 minutes before heading outside, and reapply every two hours—especially if you're swimming or sweating. Cle de Peau Beauté UV Protective Cream SPF 50+ This chemical sunscreen offers up to 10 hours of hydration. It features standout ingredients like Moroccan thyme extract, which helps combat signs of photoaging, along with plant extracts such as mangosteen and ginseng, as well as a complex with Japanese pearl shell extract to help leave the skin looking refreshed. Shiseido Ultra Sun Protector Lotion SPF 50+ This non-comedogenic formula offers coverage against both types of ultraviolet rays and is powered by innovative technology that actually strengthens protection when exposed to heat and water. Infused with plant extracts and amino acids that help defend against blue light and signs of aging, it's an ideal choice for those who are active in the sun. Naked Sundays SPF50+ Collagen Glow 100% Mineral Perfecting Priming Lotion This non-comedogenic mineral sunscreen features ingredients effective for sun protection without oxybenzone, linked to coral reef damage. Gentle enough for sensitive skin, it's also infused with watermelon extract and leaves a translucent finish (no white cast in sight). EltaMD UV Clear Tinted Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 EltaMD's tinted sunscreen offers protection against both UVA and UVB rays with a hybrid, non-comedogenic formula that combines both chemical and physical filters. The subtle tint provides a natural-looking glow with no white cast. Infused with niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin E, it also has a lightweight texture that layers well under makeup and helps even out skin tone. La Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral Tinted Ultra Fluid SPF 50 Facial Sunscreen Another standout physical sunscreen, this formula uses mineral-based titanium dioxide to deliver broad-spectrum protection. It's a good option for sensitive skin as it is non-comedogenic, gentle, and tinted for a natural glow. Infused with thermal spring water for antioxidant benefits, it absorbs quickly, making it an ideal base under makeup. Supergoop! Protec(tint) Daily SPF Tint SPF 50 Sunscreen Skin Tint Supergoop's Protec(tint) SPF offers both chemical and physical sun protection—plus clay infused with hyaluronic acid and additional defence against stress on skin from radiation, blue light, and pollution. Available in 14 shades, it's a sunscreen that doubles as complexion coverage. Paula's Choice Resist Youth-Extending Daily Hydrating Fluid SPF 50 This sunscreen offers chemical protection against UVA and UVB rays, and features ingredients such as oat bran, green tea, and grape seed extract for a soothing effect. It's a water-based formula aiming to calm and even the skin tone, leaving a smooth finish—ideal for someone who wears sunscreen on its own or layered under makeup.

The list represents the absolute best of the best in each category we cover, featuring insights from our staff and industry experts. With Amazon Prime Day well underway, we've catalogued every winner on sale right now below, including 45% off our favorite water flosser, 25% off our top self-tanner, and 24% off this excellent personal blender. We stand by the quality and value of every item on this list even at full price, so when they're on sale you can be certain you're picking a winner. In addition to the extensive testing we've done on the products below, the deals featured here have been price-checked across multiple retailers and vetted by our deals staff.

It's an easy way to help maintain your dental hygiene, especially those harder to reach spaces in your mouth. Waterpik is like the Kleenex of the water flosser world and the Aquarius is our favorite model overall. It's powerful, versatile and carries an ADA seal of approval—which is not universal to all water flossers. This Prime Day deal is the best price we've seen for this model in 2025. Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0 Smokeless Fire Pit With Stand Fire pits are a year-round staple, whether you're camping, posted up at the beach or hanging out in your backyard. Solo Stove's portable smokeless design is our favorite fire pit overall for its efficiency and versatility. Just be warned: I let my dad borrow mine for a road trip and he never gave it back. A 20% discount on the solo stove is not atypical, but it's still a nice opportunity to grab one on sale if you're in the market. Field Company No.8 Cast-Iron Skillet This upgraded cast-iron is ideal for home cooks ready to invest in an heirloom-quality piece. The Field's skillet is lightweight—roughly a pound lighter than other designs we tested—and has a smooth cooking surface that helps create a nonstick barrier for delicate foods like eggs. Better yet: This discount is the best price we've seen for this skillet on Amazon. Supergoop PLAY Everyday Lotion SPF 50 Our favorite sunscreen hydrates, calms and protects your skin from the sun without leaving you feeling greasy. Its formula helps block UVA, UVB and infrared radiation, and it can hold up against sweat and water for over an hour. You can also use the lotion head-to-toe for quick, full-body coverage. Supergoop hosts semi-regular sales online, but this is still a great time to stock up for summer. Away The Bigger Carry-On Luggage You've likely heard of Away by now. The trendy suitcase brand is a favorite among our editors and the maker of our pick for the best carry-on luggage overall. The Bigger Carry-On is spacious, durable and thoughtfully designed with an internal compression system that makes it easier to fit everything you need in your bag. This 20% discount is limited to select colorways, including the pictured Cloud Gray above. Other colors are available for 15% off. St.Tropez Self Tan Express Mousse We love a sun-kissed tan; a good self-tanner can help give you that beachy look without the potential sun damage. Our favorite formula is an easy-to-apply mousse that absorbs quickly....","Every year we highlight top picks from our extensive product testing for the Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards (FVBPA).

It's an easy way to help maintain your dental hygiene, especially those harder to reach spaces in your mouth. Waterpik is like the Kleenex of the water flosser world and the Aquarius is our favorite model overall. It's powerful, versatile and carries an ADA seal of approval—which is not universal to all water flossers. This Prime Day deal is the best price we've seen for this model in 2025. Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0 Smokeless Fire Pit With Stand Fire pits are a year-round staple, whether you're camping, posted up at the beach or hanging out in your backyard. Solo Stove's portable smokeless design is our favorite fire pit overall for its efficiency and versatility. Just be warned: I let my dad borrow mine for a road trip and he never gave it back. A 20% discount on the solo stove is not atypical, but it's still a nice opportunity to grab one on sale if you're in the market. Field Company No.8 Cast-Iron Skillet This upgraded cast-iron is ideal for home cooks ready to invest in an heirloom-quality piece. The Field's skillet is lightweight—roughly a pound lighter than other designs we tested—and has a smooth cooking surface that helps create a nonstick barrier for delicate foods like eggs. Better yet: This discount is the best price we've seen for this skillet on Amazon. Supergoop PLAY Everyday Lotion SPF 50 Our favorite sunscreen hydrates, calms and protects your skin from the sun without leaving you feeling greasy. Its formula helps block UVA, UVB and infrared radiation, and it can hold up against sweat and water for over an hour. You can also use the lotion head-to-toe for quick, full-body coverage. Supergoop hosts semi-regular sales online, but this is still a great time to stock up for summer. Away The Bigger Carry-On Luggage You've likely heard of Away by now. The trendy suitcase brand is a favorite among our editors and the maker of our pick for the best carry-on luggage overall. The Bigger Carry-On is spacious, durable and thoughtfully designed with an internal compression system that makes it easier to fit everything you need in your bag. This 20% discount is limited to select colorways, including the pictured Cloud Gray above. Other colors are available for 15% off. St.Tropez Self Tan Express Mousse We love a sun-kissed tan; a good self-tanner can help give you that beachy look without the potential sun damage. Our favorite formula is an easy-to-apply mousse that absorbs quickly....",2025-07-08 19:50:54,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"The content directly discusses a Supergoop! product (PLAY Everyday Lotion SPF 50) in the context of a product review and Prime Day sale, highlighting its key features like sun protection, hydration, and water resistance.

mov_8FA0902E303B553C6016F99206C985DE,"  When it comes to skincare, I favour low-maintenance, hybrid formulas that can shave minutes off my routine. Eliminating the need for multiple steps, tinted SPFs protect my skin from sun damage and give me glowy, pigmented coverage. Tick, tick, tick. But with some of the best formulas on the market costing upwards of £30 for a small tube (we're looking at you, Ultra Violette and Supergoop!) , I'm always looking for budget buys that can do the job just as well. Enter: Garnier's vitamin C daily UV brightening fluid glow (a mouthful, I know). My go-to affordable tinted SPF, the lightweight formula has a creamy consistency that's easy to blend across your face, while SPF50 has all bases covered when it comes to sun protection. Designed to be one-shade-fits-all, the cream gives your skin a glowy and lightweight coverage. The slimline tube is perfect for packing in your beach bag on holiday and topping up when you want a little more coverage after a dip in the sea. The best part is that it costs a little more than £10 – but it's now even cheaper thanks to Amazon Prime Day. Whether you're jetting off on holiday, enjoying the first sunny days of spring or looking for a new everyday skincare staple, here's why Garnier's tinted SPF should be in your next beauty haul. How we tested Testing the vitamin C-infused formula alongside more premium products, I've worn it for beach days and office days. Considering the ease of application (whether with a brush, sponge or fingers), coverage claims, staying power, the look and feel on my skin, as well as its SPF credentials, here's my verdict on Garnier's tinted SPF. The verdict: Garnier vitamin C daily UV brightening fluid glow Easily rivalling more premium tinted SPF formulas, Garnier's vitamin C face cream not only provides SPF50 protection but also gives skin a glowy, lightweight coverage. The finish is long-lasting and dewy, while the value for money is stellar at £5. Looking for more tinted SPF recommendations?

Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. Kindle E-Readers back on sale for the first time since 2024! (23% off) You read that right! This well-rated Kindle e-reader hasn't been marked down since the holiday season of LAST YEAR, so you'll wanna move on this quickly. With a high-resolution, glare-free and paper-like display plus an adjustable built-in light and a dark mode — this e-reader can be used day and night. Its 16 GB of storage is enough to store thousands of books (and . pdfs and documents), and with an added Kindle Unlimited subscription (free for the first three months if you make the selection), you can just pull those ebooks from the cloud. This small device is perfect for commuters, travelers who can't pack a ton of books or anyone looking to declutter their libraries. Scrub Daddy and Scrub Mommy 8-pack (20% off list price) Scrub Daddys and Scrub Mommys are beloved by cleaning enthusiasts, plus they come in fun colors. They stay firm in colder water for heavy-duty scrubbing and soften when exposed to warm water. You can even use them on stainless steel and cast iron, as they are scratch-free. Clean up after yourself without having to break a sweat thanks to these effective little dudes. This is the first time this pack is on sale during Prime Day and the lowest price of the year. Aquaphor itch relief ointment two-pack (30% off list price) Aquaphor's itch relief ointment for kids can be used on children ages two and up to soothe itchy patches of eczema, rashes, psoriasis and more. It's made with 1% hydrocortisone, and an absolute must as we approach the summer months, when insect bites abound and contact with poison ivy is a possibility. This is the first time this two-pack has been available for under $10 and featured during Prime Day. HuffPost editor Quay Battle swears by this for ""instant itch relief"" on eczema patches. Dawn Platinum Plus Powerwash dish spray (30% off list price) Dawn foaming dish spray works superbly and most professional cleaners will tell you that you can use it to clean more than dishes.

The adjustable trolley handle has two height settings, while the interior compression pad system and organizer makes it easy to load up on clothing. It also comes with a water-repellent laundry bag. It's available in seven colors. Heads up: This is the first time Away luggage has been part of the Prime Day sale so grab it up while you can! Wet & Forget weekly shower cleaner (33% off list price) This super popular, low-maintenance shower cleaner promises to require no scrubbing at all — just spray it on scummy shower walls, let sit overnight and then rinse to get rid of built-up soap, grime, stains and body oils. It's bleach-free and safe for most surfaces, including glass, porcelain, sandstone and tile, though it's not recommended for use on natural marble. It's rarely on sale (we know; we've been tracking it) but today, you can get it for less than its usual $24 price tag. Clinique Almost Lipstick tinted lip balm (18% off list price) Beauty lovers know that this perfectly hued beauty product is the end-all be-all of lip balms. It's available in Black Honey and Pink Honey shades, though Black Honey is a cult-favorite lip color that is considered universally flattering and has been popular since the early aughts. This semi-glossy balm is perfect for everyday wear and rarely goes on sale. HEADS UP: This lip color is going like hot cakes right now so if you've been on the fence, now's the time to make a move.

Sure, the headlines are all about big-ticket Prime Day steals (looking at you, Ninja CREAMi), but let's not ignore the real heroes: under-$30 deals that make everyday life a little better. From discounted LEGO sets to Supergoop! sunscreen and LANEIGE blurring powder, these Prime Day finds prove you don't need to drop hundreds to feel like a savvy shopper stocking your home. Check out the best Prime Day deals under $30 before they sell out—because they definitely will.

STANLEY Quencher H2.0 Tumbler with Handle and Straw 40 oz — $27 (was $45) Stanley made big mugs THE thing to carry. This 40-ounce mother of mugs carries as much fluid as a 7-Eleven Super Big Gulp while stylishly keeping hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold, and it still fits in most car cup holders. Be warned: Stanley deals are going out of stock fast, and only some colors—think Almond Rose and Fuschia—are available for under $30 right now. Move fast. More deals on insulated drinkware and containers LEGO Classic Large Creative Brick Box 10698 Building Toy Set — $25.59 (was $59.99) People love a creative Lego set that becomes, say, the Millennium Falcon, Old Trafford, or a cute flower bouquet. The problem is that those masterpieces usually stay masterpieces forever. If you need a set of bricks to actually play with or fuel original designs, this box of classic blocks is it. The play set includes two green base plates, six toy tires with rims, and more than 700 other bricks in 33 colors.

Unseen Sunscreen – SPF 40 – $30.40 (was $38) Technically just over $30, but it's 20% off this beloved (and usually pricey) sunscreen. If your current bottle is running low—or if you're still rationing those pea-sized dollops—consider this your nudge to restock. Dermatologists recommend using a full ounce on any exposed skin and reapplying every two hours, after swimming, or if you're super sweaty. Yeah, you probably need another tube. Unseen Sunscreen feels almost like a dry powder on the skin. It's never tacky, greasy, or shiny. It's basically magic in a tube, and your future sun-damage-free self will thank you. More deals on sunscreens LANEIGE Neo Blurring Powder — $17.50 (was $25) Treat your skin with a treat. I would say Korean skincare products work like magic, but that belittles the shocking amount of science behind them. LANEIGE specializes in hydrating skin, infusing products like this blurring powder with hyaluronic acid, ceramides, peptides, antioxidants, amino acids, and plant extracts.

Sure, the headlines are all about big-ticket Prime Day steals (looking at you, Ninja CREAMi), but let's not ignore the real heroes: under-$30 deals that make everyday life a little better. From discounted LEGO sets to Supergoop! sunscreen and LANEIGE blurring powder, these Prime Day finds prove you don't need to drop hundreds to feel like a savvy shopper stocking your home. Check out the best Prime Day deals under $30 before they sell out—because they definitely will. Remember, if you don't have an active Amazon Prime subscription, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial here. STANLEY Quencher H2.0 Tumbler with Handle and Straw 40 oz — $27 (was $45) Stanley made big mugs THE thing to carry. This 40-ounce mother of mugs carries as much fluid as a 7-Eleven Super Big Gulp while stylishly keeping hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold, and it still fits in most car cup holders. Be warned: Stanley deals are going out of stock fast, and only some colors—think Almond Rose and Fuschia—are available for under $30 right now. Move fast. More deals on insulated drinkware and containers LEGO Classic Large Creative Brick Box 10698 Building Toy Set — $25.59 (was $59.99) People love a creative Lego set that becomes, say, the Millennium Falcon, Old Trafford, or a cute flower bouquet. The problem is that those masterpieces usually stay masterpieces forever. If you need a set of bricks to actually play with or fuel original designs, this box of classic blocks is it. The play set includes two green base plates, six toy tires with rims, and more than 700 other bricks in 33 colors.

Unseen Sunscreen – SPF 40 – $30.40 (was $38) Technically just over $30, but it's 20% off this beloved (and usually pricey) sunscreen. If your current bottle is running low—or if you're still rationing those pea-sized dollops—consider this your nudge to restock. Dermatologists recommend using a full ounce on any exposed skin and reapplying every two hours, after swimming, or if you're super sweaty. Yeah, you probably need another tube. Unseen Sunscreen feels almost like a dry powder on the skin. It's never tacky, greasy, or shiny. It's basically magic in a tube, and your future sun-damage-free self will thank you. More deals on sunscreens LANEIGE Neo Blurring Powder — $17.50 (was $25) Treat your skin with a treat. I would say Korean skincare products work like magic, but that belittles the shocking amount of science behind them. LANEIGE specializes in hydrating skin, infusing products like this blurring powder with hyaluronic acid, ceramides, peptides, antioxidants, amino acids, and plant extracts. This lightweight powder mattifies your face without looking cakey, and its no-spill packaging makes it great for your travel bag or daily routine.

n2igwby,"  I'm not saying this to be argumentative, but I can't find a way to word it otherwise. I'd like you to try and explain why a non-Australian sunscreen wouldn't be ok to use for extended periods in the sun here if they have the same ratings. I think you misunderstand what ""Australian standards"" actually are. Though obviously not the entirety of it, they largely boil down to picking what filters are known factors and okay to use. Korea is faster to approve new filters due to how their own regulations work; which means they end up with more cosmetically elegant products and avoid the use of the typical ingredients that give the ""greasy"" feel sunscreen is known for. Australia is fast compared to the US, but is still a bit ""behind the times"" in this regard. But conversely, it's not like the filters Korea is using are new and not yet tested/proven. Again, I want to emphasise - plenty of these products have widely available, peer-reviewed and cross-tested results. Because they're mostly white-label, it shouldn't scare you that they're using newer filters than those in Australian formulas at the moment. They're proven formulas. Australia is just slower to approve them, and that may not even be due to Australia doing more rigorous testing. They're just classified differently here, so the approval process takes longer. The story Lab Muffin/Michelle brings up about the SuperGOOP sunscreen wasn't mentioned to downplay that sunscreen's efficacy (I know nothing about it). If that was her intent, she wouldn't have spent the rest of the video recommending imported sunscreens. Her language is English-speaking; by this logic, she would have no reason to bring up Asian market sunscreens. Look at what she says prior to that; Australian restrictions are preventing the discussion of Australian sunscreen products online, but she believes more discussion should be encouraged because it lessens the reputation of sunscreen as cosmetically inelegant and just overall ""undesirable."" When influencers talk more about the sunscreens that have worked for them and feel good to use, it turns sunscreen into a product people actually WANT to use - which is the main issue affecting how many people adequately protect themselves from the sun. I want to emphasise too that nowhere in her video does she say Australian sunscreens will be more effective than others in the Australian sun. There is another video she talks about this more, it may be one of her more recent ""Correcting Misinformation"" videos. Forgive me, I'm at work so I can't get the link. Could have been a short debunking another woman on YouTube who was spreading misinformation? Unsure. One example: Biore UV (one of the first Asian sunscreens to get huge overseas) has four filters that are approved in Australia, and all it's formulations have been tested incredibly rigorously under ISO methods that Australia accepts. However, the company hasn't brought it over here because they'd have to get it listed on the ARTG, get their factories certified in GMP (not particularly related to sunscreen testing; just general manufacturing practice), manufacture with new labeling that meets our regulations, among a multitude of other costs to keep their product on Australian shelves. Plus, being a water-resistant sunscreen (and arguably one of the best), there are even more things they'd need to pay for certification on. It's just not worth it for many overseas companies. That does not mean that the overseas testing it has had done on it is less valid than Australian testing. It meets Australian standards in terms of testing procedure and formulation, but that doesn't suddenly mean the company has the go ahead to sell it here.

mov_E9341563588A2F77AF5CA430D6A324C5,"  Depending on how similar the items are, and the rights a company holds, dupes may or may not cross legal lines To customers, a lookalike to Ugg's Tasman slippers or a knock-off of Lululemon's ultra-popular Define jacket can be a fantastic bargain. But to the companies that make the original products, similar-but-cheaper items can be bad for business. While knock-offs are nothing new, dupes — short for ""duplicate"" — have exploded in popularity in recent years. And for many younger buyers, buying an imitation is no longer something to hide. ""A lot of the consumers that we're seeing on social media, on TikTok, are so proudly displaying the dupes that they found, kind of as a badge of honour. That stigma really isn't there anymore,"" said Julie Zerbo, editor-in-chief of fashion publication The Fashion Law. The rise of dupes has also brought a corresponding wave of lawsuits from companies, saying copies of their products shouldn't be allowed to exist. American Eagle, Sol de Janeiro, Benefit Cosmetics, Deckers Brands (Ugg's parent company) and Supergoop are just a few of the fashion and beauty companies on that list. Vancouver-based Lululemon became a recent entrant when it sued Costco late last month over three products it said were knock-offs of its clothing. But are they actually illegal? Intellectual property experts say it really depends on the rights a company has over a product, and whether customers can tell the difference between the original and its copycat. When do dupes cross the line? The term ""dupe"" itself has been appearing more in legal filings, says Alexandra Roberts, law and media professor at Northeastern University — including in Lululemon's against Costco. That could partially be because their appeal has grown among online shoppers. ""Where in previous years, a company might have just said, 'Oh, this looks to us like trademark infringement,' here, [brands] are kind of building a case around the idea of [a] dupe,"" Roberts said. ""The fact that something is perceived as a dupe ... that all works its way into the allegations."" WATCH | Trying to beat online fashion copies: Trying to beat online fashion copies 8 months agoDuration 2:25 Loren Mallett, an intellectual property lawyer in Vancouver, says any case where a company says it's been copied largely depends on the rights it has over its product. Patents, industrial designs and trademarks can all protect certain parts of an item — but a company has to formally register elements like its logo or packaging design. If it hasn't, it's probably out of luck, Mallett says. And even if it has, it still might be OK to sell something really similar. The legality of a dupe depends on whether customers could be confused by the two items and think they are the exact same, Roberts says. In Lululemon's case, for example, the question might be whether buyers of the Costco sweatshirt thought they were purchasing Lululemon's Scuba hoodie, Roberts says. She says people tend to like dupes specifically because they aren't the real deal, but a cheaper alternative. And for that reason, she says, many may not be successfully litigated against. LISTEN | Dupe culture: Why Gen Z is embracing fakes: While we don't necessarily think of them as dupes, generic brands — think Life brand products sold at Shoppers Drug Mart, or Walmart's Great Value — have occupied this space for a long time, Roberts says. And historically, courts have allowed them because customers understand that one is meant to be a cheaper alternative to the other. Mallett adds that the conversation around dupes could impact companies like Lululemon in court, as many customers have said online that some of Costco's products look just like Lululemon's. The athleisure company will likely argue this as evidence that Costco wanted to pass off its product as a Lululemon item — whereas Costco will likely say it is proof the customer knew for a fact they were buying a similar-looking alternative at a lower price, according to Mallett. A case study Zerbo says many dupe-related cases are still making their way through courts. But there are some resolved ones where the lookalike has come out on top. She points to a recent conflict in the U.S. between Steve Madden and Ganni as a good example. Danish footwear brand Ganni sent cease-and-desist letters to some companies that sold certain Steve Madden shoes, saying they looked too similar to its own buckle ballerina flats and two-strap sandals. But Steve Madden turned around and sued Ganni, saying it had no right to tell those retailers they couldn't sell the similar Steve Madden shoes, because there was ""nothing new or original"" about a shoe made of leather and that has straps, eyelets and buckles — common elements in lots of footwear. Ganni ultimately walked back its original legal threats, Zerbo said, and even agreed not to sue in the future over the shoe designs. (Ganni was more successful in its home country of Denmark, however.) Zerbo says these cases show how courts generally don't want monopolies, and try to prevent giving a brand that kind of power. ""That would be bad for competition, that would be bad for consumers, prices would go through the roof."" What does that mean for my dupes? Zerbo says duping is unlikely to slow down anytime soon, as many shoppers love a good deal. She says history is full of copycat designs, which have largely been allowed to exist. Take fast fashion, for example. Companies like H&M and Forever 21 became giants mainly by replicating runway elements for a cheaper price. ""It's such a big market. There's so much consumer demand for dupes that companies would be hard pressed to stop trying to make them.""...","Depending on how similar the items are, and the rights a company holds, dupes may or may not cross legal lines To customers, a lookalike to Ugg's Tasman slippers or a knock-off of Lululemon's ultra-popular Define jacket can be a fantastic bargain.

Avant de s'exposer au soleil, on veille à protéger notre corps et notre visage. On choisit alors la bonne crème solaire, on l'applique méticuleusement sur les épaules, le dos, les bras, le visage, le cou... Pourtant, une zone manque souvent à l'appel. Si on met de la crème SPF sur le visage, on ne pense pas toujours aux lèvres. Les lèvres aussi ont besoin d'être protégées du soleil et de rester hydratées. La peau y est particulièrement fine et délicate, donc susceptible de prendre un coup de soleil. Comment reconnaître un coup de soleil sur les lèvres? Si vos lèvres ont trop pris le soleil et n'ont pas été protégées, en cas de coup de soleil léger, elles seront sèches et irritées. Si celui-ci est intense, des cloques blanches peuvent survenir, ainsi que des saignements. La lèvre inférieure sera très certainement la plus touchée, puisque c'est celle qui capte le plus la lumière. Comment traiter le coup de soleil sur les lèvres? Si le coup de soleil est léger, hydratez vos lèvres régulièrement. Vous pouvez utiliser de l'aloe vera que vous aurez au préalable laissé refroidir au réfrigérateur. L'irritation peut aussi être soulagée par un gant de toilette humide qui va rafraîchir la zone. N'arrachez pas la peau sèche, elle se détachera toute seule lorsque la nouvelle sera prête. Si le coup de soleil est intense, n'essayez pas de faire éclater les cloques. Laissez-les disparaître d'elles-mêmes. Elles peuvent rester de 5 à 15 jours, alors faites preuve de patience. Prenez le temps de laisser vos lèvres se remettre du coup de soleil, notamment en évitant de vous exposer aux rayons UV. De plus, n'utilisez pas de produits potentiellement irritants, contenant des acides alpha, bêta-hydroxy, des rétinoïdes ou des ingrédients qui font gonfler les lèvres. Pour favoriser la cicatrisation, appliquez une hydratation régulièrement sur vos lèvres qui renforcera la barrière cutanée. Comment prévenir les coups de soleil sur les lèvres? Certains baumes à lèvres sont conçus spécialement pour nous accompagner tout au long de l'été. Les soins pour les lèvres avec un SPF peuvent être appliqués quotidiennement, tout comme votre crème de jour et votre crème solaire. Pour prendre soin de votre bouche, ne les oubliez pas.

We spoke with three certified lifeguards about their go-to sun protection strategies. ELISSA SANCI Lean into wearable sun protection. The best way to prevent sunburn is to keep your skin hidden from the sun. '' I try to stay as covered as possible even when it's pretty hot out,'' said Tess King, a Los Angeles County lifeguard. She wears a long-sleeve county-issued cotton sweatshirt when on duty. Other lifeguards opt for UV-protective clothing. Tommi Dubinski, a New York City--based lifeguard and emergency medical technician, is always decked out in protective sun clothing. One of her preferred items is the Outdoor Research Echo Hoodie, and she's a fan of Buff's UV neck gaiters. Wyatt Werneth, who has over 30 years of open-water lifeguarding experience in Cocoa Beach, Fla., said he keeps himself covered with a combination of sun shirts, sun hats and gaiters. Slather on the sunscreen, and reapply often. Wearing sunscreen is an extremely important part of sun safety. If you plan to spend long stretches of time outside, reapplying it multiple times is critical. At the beginning of her shift, Ms. King slathers herself in the sunscreen she's been using for 10 years: Blue Lizard Sensitive Mineral SPF 50 Sunscreen Lotion. She'll reapply Blue Lizard three to four times during her typical eight to 10 hours in the sun. Ms. King also swears by the tinted Vertra Sunscreen Face Stick SPF 38, which she uses as her primary face coverage. Ms. Dubinski's go-to body sunscreen is Supergoop Play Everyday Lotion SPF 50, a longtime Wirecutter pick. She likes that it doesn't feel tacky or greasy. Mr. Werneth keeps spray sunscreen on hand to use in a pinch. But if you do burn, this can help. Even the pros suffer from sunburn occasionally. The key is knowing how to treat the sting of your sunburn. '' Basic sunburn is considered a first-degree burn,'' Ms. Dubinski said, ''and the first thing we're taught in E.M.S. training is to stop the burn process. That could mean covering up, getting out of the sun, taking a cool shower.'' Once your skin is clean and cooled, reach for soothing topical creams. Ms. King treats her sunburns with Vanicream Moisturizing Cream.Elissa Sanci is a senior staff writer at Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times Company.

A duo of Aquaphor Lip Repair tubes because I'm sure I'm not the only one suffering from extremely chapped lips. It's fragrance-and-paraben-free and filled with soothing shea butter and chamomile essence that'll help heal your lips in time for your next date night. Promising review: ""One of the best lip balms I've ever used. I love to sleep with it and wake up with my lips completely renewed. Highly recommended."" —Cintia Gomes Get a pack of two from Amazon for $8.36. 2. La Roche-Posay triple repair moisturizer helps revive the dry skin of everyone in your household. It's safe for babies, children, and adults, so it helps reduce the number of products on your bathroom vanity! It's non-greasy and formulated with shea butter and niacinamide to restore the skin's protective barrier. Promising review: ""Most people have already said it perfectly — this is extraordinary. I use it on my face at night and feel the moisturizing effects last through the next morning and beyond. I've tried dozens of products all across price ranges, and this is just super special. I love that it is a bit thick, and it feels really pure. I don't know what the magic is here, but whatever they did could easily cost 5x the price. It evens tone, helps with wrinkles, refines pores, skin glows, and does not irritate.

Note that the AAD recommends using at least SPF 30 and reapplying as needed for skin protection. You can read about sunscreen myths and facts from dermatologists for more information!
