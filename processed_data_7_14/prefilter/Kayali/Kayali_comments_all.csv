These fruity fragrances have a versatile and rich scent, and experts agree: “Cherry can be the star of the fragrance or in a supporting role adding a layer of sweetness or sultriness to the scent,” says Linda G. Levy, president of The Fragrance Foundation. If you're looking to dive into this crave-worthy scent, we spoke with Glamour editors and perfumers to find the best ones, from iconic luxury high-end options to ones you can pick up at your local drugstore. Our top pick overall is Fine'ry Not Another Cherry Eau de Parfum, because it's affordable at under $50 and perfectly encapsulates the juicy note without being too sweet or sultry. But there are plenty more delightful cherry fragrances out there for every occasion. The best cherry perfumes, at a glance How we tested cherry perfumes AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevron We tested cherry perfumes by evaluating their notes, how sweet or tart they were and how long they lasted after application. The best ones had complex cherry notes and other scents and flavors like woods, vanilla and florals.

It blends cherry with almond amaretto and turkish rose for a sweet, sensual scent that's appropriate for day time and evening hours. “I love spritzing this on when I have a packed day heading from the office to events after work. It not only lasts a full eight hours, it also blends nicely with my skin's natural scent and makes me smell sweet but not overly saccharine.

With notes of black cherry, bitter almond and vanilla, it's suitable for special occasions and date nights. The brand also has other takes on the Lost Cherry eau de parfum, including Cherry Smoke, which is a warmer, spicier option and Electric Cherry, which is floral and more effervescent. “Electric Cherry is truly an explosion of cherry that is surprisingly wearable and addictive,” says Levy.

1lpxaf8,"  I had been so curious about them and haven't seen many reviews, so I figured I would post mine! Their TAT is insanely quick which I LOVE! Let's get into it! Here's my ranking scale: 1. I am scrubbing immediately 2. Very underwhelming, probably would not purchase OR scrubbed but would give a second chance 3. Somewhat enjoyable, didn't scrub, could maybe try this again in the future 4. I am probably going to size up from the sample size, I enjoyed this 5. I love it, full size full size full size **Moon Bathing-** *""Lychee fruit, milk, vanilla, jasmine grandiflorum, salt""* Woah. The freshness/tart of the lychee balances the laconic of the milk and sweetness of the vanilla perfectly. This is a fruity gourmand in the best way possible. The light pink is gorgeous, this song smells like Pink in the Night by Mitski if you've ever heard it. I do not smell the salt but maybe it's just what's contributing to the “tart” of the lychee which I adore. As time progresses you can kind of get that floral in the background too. Which I would usually say I could do without but here it builds a solid base. Vibes are definitely light, delicate, fem, fruity, youthful but reserved, clean 4.5/5 **Parakeet-** *""Fizzy grapefruit soda, freshly picked daisies, tiny forget-me-nots, and the powdery sweet down feathers of a well groomed parakeet""* Omg why am I slowly coming to realize I love tart?! This smells like a Sweetart/tart candy to me. I think it's the grapefruit that does this. It's very beautiful and summer ish! This is what I would imagine that very pricey Odette fragrance with the swan on it smells like. However, I really do wish the dry down was as effervescent and pretty as the opening. You do still get hits of that grapefruit throughout, but it does become floral dominant and lose some of that fizzy soda aspect (which it does indeed capture perfectly). I feel very split on this only because I think the daisy note isn't for me but I would honestly recommend this to anyone who wants a fizzy grapefruit citrus soda flowery vibe. Of note: My boyfriend, who has to be the pickiest person on earth (maybe I only say this because I subject him to bakery level gourmands which he is not a fan of) LOVES THIS. 3/5 **Alibi-** *""Passionfruit, orange blossom, guava, strawberry yuzu lemonade, and a dash of coconut cream over a rosewood base""* More tart! But this means full tropical and it is beautiful. It is sexy, fruity, tropical, tart, and unapologetic. This immediately transports me to Maui. The coconut keeps it balanced, you can get a dash of it throughout. Personally it leans too fruity and juicy for me. Like you really do smell like a mix of red fruits. I do get the name though, you smell so delicious it's almost too good to be true. This is a great fragrance for sure but it is just not for me personally. 3/5 **A Dog Named Pam-** *""Juniper berry, petitgrain, bitter orange, red mandarin, cedarwood, palo santo, and a warm fuzzy musk that feels to me like the hot belly of a clean dog""* This is what I think Nami from One Piece would smell like. This is a new HG for me. This is bitter orange without being too astringent or violent on the nose....","I had been so curious about them and haven't seen many reviews, so I figured I would post mine!

1ls7lxs,"  I want to share a fragrance grieveance story of mine. I absolutely adore Cherry Ambition by The 7 Virtues. Looove the opening of this dark boozy but still juicy cherry and on paper I also really like the drydown. It reminds me of Angel's Share but for some reason spicy fragrances with a lot of notes go super dusty and powdery and overwhelming on my skin 🥲🥲 same thing happens with Angel's share where the drydown just smells like an oberwhelming powdery mess on me. I wore Cherry Ambition again yesterday and unfortunately after an hour, it just smells like I'm putting my nose into a dusty old makeup bag which I hate. So I think I'll have to sell it and it makes me really sad cause I love everything about The 7 Virtues and own many of their fragrances (Santal Vanille is my signature scent and I also have Amber Vanilla, Coconut Sun & Vetiver Elemi). So now I'm looking into cherry perfumes that can replace it and don't turn so powdery & dusty on me. I'd love a juicy or creamy cherry or even musky.

Kayali Lovefest Burning Cherry. Blind buy (yeah, i know. I have a problem) but I'm soo glad I did! Love it. Hubby went nuts over it. Sephora. Scandal by JPG. I had tried a sampler of the Absolu and loved it but read the original had more honey notes. Went and tried it and loved it even more. Got 20 percent off at Shoppers today with the friends and family deal. Finally, Lattafa Yara Candy. Another blind buy (seriously, I need adult supervision) but I do like it.
