The U.S. color cosmetics market was valued at USD 21.52 billion in 2024, with projections indicating a rise to USD 35.52 billion by 2030, demonstrating a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 8.8% during the forecast period of 2025 to 2030. This expansion is significantly propelled by the growth of e-commerce and technological advancements that have revolutionized the industry. Consumers now have easier access to a diverse array of products, while brands can engage with a wider audience through digital channels. Innovations like augmented reality (AR) virtual try-ons have elevated the online shopping experience, allowing users to visualize products before purchase, thereby enhancing both convenience and personalization. Social media platforms, including Instagram, YouTube, and TikTok, have become instrumental in shaping beauty trends and influencing consumer choices. Beauty influencers and makeup artists leverage these platforms to share tutorials, product reviews, and new techniques, directly impacting purchasing decisions. Brands are increasingly utilizing social media for product launches, audience engagement, and the creation of viral trends to boost sales and cultivate brand loyalty. A notable trend in 2024 is the rapid growth of the men's grooming and skincare market, driven by evolving societal norms and the strong influence of platforms like TikTok, where hashtags such as #mensskincare have gained widespread popularity. This trend reflects a shifting perspective on masculinity, encouraging more men to adopt skincare and beauty routines, prompting brands to develop product lines specifically tailored for male consumers. Key Market Dynamics & Insights: Facial Color Cosmetics Dominance: In 2024, facial color cosmetics held a share of approximately 39.03% of the U.S. color cosmetics market. This is attributed to their fundamental role in daily beauty routines and the extensive range of products within this category. Hypermarkets and Supermarkets as Key Distribution Channels: Sales through hypermarkets and supermarkets accounted for roughly 34.14% of the total U.S. color cosmetics market in 2024.

mov_0F616B39CDCF16B93AE3EDD8AD4F4C1C,"  An everyday lipstick, like any other part of a makeup or beauty routine, is inherently personal and varies from person to person. I've gone through practically every phase imaginable. At one point, a bright cherry red was my go-to. At another, I wanted a nude lipstick so subtle I could barely tell it apart from my natural lip color—the versatility is part of what makes playing with makeup so fun. Still, there are a few boxes that your go-to formula should easily check. “A great everyday lipstick is all about balance,” says celebrity makeup artist Ash K. Holm. “It should be comfortable, long-wearing, and easy to apply without a mirror.” Holm adds that a formula that hydrates the lips is ideal, but it also needs enough pigment to pull a look together. On top of that, it should fade evenly—no harsh lines as it wears off throughout the day. Sounds like a tall order? It is, but that's where I come in. Next to blush, lipstick is one of my absolute favorite makeup categories to test, and I've come across quite a few that can satisfy even the pickiest beauty lover. Keep reading to find the everyday lipstick that deserves a spot in your collection. The Best Everyday Lipsticks Best Everyday Lipstick Overall MAC Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick in Thanks, It's Mac! MAC's Lustreglass Lipstick, specifically in the shade Thanks It's MAC, is the closest thing to a truly universal lipstick that I have ever found. It's a taupey pink with a silver pearl, but don't let that scare you—the shimmer is virtually nonexistent in this formula once you swipe it onto your lips. One of my favorite things about this shade is that it can be worn with or without a lip liner, and it layers beautifully. Finish: Glossy Key Ingredients: Castor seed oil, shea butter, squalane (moisturizing) What I Love: Looks good on the majority of skin tones; Sleek packaging; Barely-there scent What I Don't: Due to the emollience of the formula, it wears off quickly Review for MC: “This is one of my favorite lipsticks of all time, and for good reason. It's a neutral-toned taupe pink color that doesn't veer too cool or warm, making it perfectly suitable for a variety of skin tones. It also layers beautifully with other lipstick formulas in my collection, acting almost like a traditional gloss by depositing color without taking over the entire look.” — Ariel Baker, Beauty Writer Ariel Baker testing MAC Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick in Thanks, Its Mac! (Image credit: Ariel Baker) Best Everyday Neutral Lipstick NYX Smushy Matte Lip Balm in Soft Smile This is a newer formula to my makeup routine, but I'm so glad I came across it. The Smush Matte Lip Balms sound a little confusing (mainly because I've never used a lip balm that's actually matte before), but once I applied it, I saw the magic in the formula. I'd consider this more of a blurring lipstick, similar to soft-focus formulas popular in the K-Beauty space. The shade Soft Smile, a brown nude, is the closest I've gotten to a true skin-toned match on myself in a long time, but it also works nicely as a neutral across a majority of skin tones. And as the brand claims, it really does blur the lines in my lips, creating a gorgeous, soft-matte canvas. Finish: Matte Key Ingredients: Dimethicone (silicone base that smooths lines); Ceramide np (improves skin barrier function); Shea butter (moisturizes) What I Love: 12 shades; Most affordable lipstick on this list What I Don't: Strong caramel scent that lingers for a bit before fading, which is a personal preference Review for MC: “This is such a fun lipstick to keep in my purse. Not only is it super compact, but the formula feels almost like a traditional silicone primer on my lips, and just like those formulas, it blurs the lines and imperfections on the area while depositing color—a win-win if you ask me. While it has a strong scent, I'm completely willing to overlook it not only for the unique formula but also the gorgeous nude shade that is Soft Smile, which complements my skin tone perfectly.” — Ariel Baker, Beauty Writer Ariel Baker testing NYX Smushy Matte Lip Balm in Soft Smile.

Peach Slices Redness Relief Color Correcting Cream for those days when your skin seems to be pitching a fit about something or another. This not only provides soothing, moisturizing ingredients like aloe and green algae, but it also has a subtle color-correcting tint that tones down redness. Think of it as a little tube of damage control for when your skin needs extra TLC. Promising review: ""I'm not one to normally leave reviews, but this is worth it. I've literally had this product for two days. I have severe rosacea on my nose. It's so bad I usually have to wear foundation to hide it because it's so noticeable. I've tried numerous products and serums with no luck, and honestly, I didn't expect this one to be any different. However, after only two days (probably applying it 4–5 times), almost all of the redness is gone! I'm in disbelief at the wonders it has done. I will without a doubt be stocking up on this product!"" —Tiffany Price: $19.88 2. Neutrogena Collagen Bank Facial Moisturizer that's basically an investment in your future face. Collagen helps keep things pinchably plump, bouncy, and glowy, which is great. But the real power player in this cream is the bakuchiol — an active ingredient which can boost cell turnover and smooth skin texture — which is basically retinol's less dramatic cousin. No joke, this study suggests that bakuchiol is just as effective as retinol while being way less likely to cause irritation. So basically, you get all the glow with none of the drama. It's a win-win. Promising review: ""The Neutrogena Collagen Bank moisturizer is making my skin feel smoother. It does not irritate my skin, and I really like the dispenser. I plan to keep using it."" —Serendipity Price: $19.97 (originally $22.97) 3. Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream because your skincare routine doesn't stop at your neck. It smells like summer vacation in a tub — think vanilla, salted caramel, and pistachio — and the fast-absorbing formula is infused with caffeine-rich guarana extract to visibly smooth and tighten. Your group chat will be demanding a scent rundown. Promising review: ""My skin is usually sensitive to anything with fragrances, this on the other hand, is perfect. It leaves my skin soft, and the fragrance ISN'T overpowering like other products. I would say over the span of a week or so I noticed a drastic improvement in my skin!"" —anonymous Price: $19.99+ (available in two sizes) 4. Aquaphor Lip Repair Ointment to rescue your lips when they feel like they've survived a beating.

Stop peeling and start slathering. Promising review: ""This product is highly recommended for maintaining moisture or replenishing moisture to chapped lips.

Preis vom 02.07.2025 09:06 Uhr So gelingt dir der perfekte Eyeliner-Strich – auch mit Glitzer Ein präziser Eyeliner-Strich sieht toll aus, ist aber oft gar nicht so leicht – vor allem bei flüssigen oder glitzernden Texturen. Unser Tipp: Stütze deinen Ellbogen beim Auftragen auf einer festen Unterlage ab, um eine ruhige Hand zu behalten. Beginne mit kleinen Punkten oder kurzen Strichen entlang des Wimpernkranzes und verbinde sie dann sanft. Für Anfänger*innen kann es helfen, zuerst mit einem matten Kajal vorzuzeichnen und den Glitzer-Eyeliner darüber aufzutragen. Und keine Sorge, wenn's nicht gleich perfekt wird – mit einem in Make-up-Entferner getränkten Wattestäbchen lässt sich alles schnell korrigieren. Der Glitzer-Eyeliner von Rossmann überzeugt uns mit seiner intensiven Farbe und dem besonderen Schimmer – ideal, wenn du Lust auf ein kreatives Augen-Make-up hast....",2025-07-02 07:19:00,de,WEB,,context|type,,,1,False,True,"The comment extensively discusses a NYX Epic Ink Liner from the Jeanz collection, providing detailed product information, highlighting its features like water-resistance, vegan formula, and glittery finish.

I was wondering if anyone has some super nice suggestions on colorful products that are cheap but down act cheap. I'm talking eye liners, shadows and mascara mostly. I have found a few things I like from my local Walmart, but I have looked at a Sephora and couldn't find ANYTHING I was interested in. I like LA colors blue eye marker but I kinda hate their bold eyeshadow. It just doesn't show up. An eyeshadow I've used daily for like 10 years is Lorac Matt Pro and I'm looking for something similar but rainbow colors. I have a Nyx vivid eyeliner and I love her (ghosted green) but she burns my eyes like crazy and I can only wear her if I'm okay with having irritated eyes. Also she's so W E T that she gets stuck in my lashes. I definitely prefer a felt tip liner than a long brush. I've looked on Amazon and I'm not impressed with their products, plus most are obnoxiously sparkly and I appreciate sparkles from a distance. Plz help I wanna be a pretty rainbow and I'm so lost","Hi! I'm super new to attempting colorful makeup but I am lowkey sick of just blacks and browns and grays.

1lqudra,"  First off, I'm very uncomfortable making this post as my body dysmorphia makes me feel incredibly embarrassed and shameful about my appearance, but here it goes: I've been struggling to find out what I can do to improve my makeup. I feel like I come off as looking like a man in a wig. So I'm looking specifically for tips on how to feminize my face among these other things, though any constructive criticism at all is welcome: - how to properly line my lips and apply lipstick with my double lip line - generally achieve a more lifted look - how to apply lower lash mascara without smudging (I've tried toilet paper under the eye and I still smudge- maybe because of my really sparse lower lashes?) - what brow shape may suit me best - proper blush color and placement - eyeliner shape that suits the shape of my eyes As for the products used, my list is as follows (I'm on mobile y'all sorry!) Primer: ELF Hydrogrip Foundation: NARS Radiant Longwear (Barcelona) Setting Spray: O/S On Til Dawn Concealer: Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser (122) Brows: ABH Dipbrow Pomade (Ebony) Mascara: Milani Highly Rated Tubing Mascara Eyeliner: ELF H2O Proof Eyeliner Pen Lower lash line: NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil (White) and Milani Supreme Kohl Kajal Lashes are extensions that definitely need filling! Blush: Milani Baked Powder Blush (Dolce Pink) Highlighter: Revolution Highlighter Reloaded (Raise the Bar) Lips: Morphe Liquid Matte Lipstick (True Story) and NYX Lingerie Push-up (Teddy) Thank y'all in advance.","First off, I'm very uncomfortable making this post as my body dysmorphia makes me feel incredibly embarrassed and shameful about my appearance, but here it goes: I've been struggling to find out what I can do to improve my makeup.

n16nmer,"  Lol long response incoming: Since you still have some time, try to experiment and see what you feel most confident and comfortable with. These are general tips that have helped me “clean up” while also being super low effort. Brows: a light cleanup with tweezers makes a big difference (strays only). If you have sparse brows, look into drugstore eyebrow pencils (ex: elf, nyx, etc.) in your hair color and lightly fill them in. None of this needs to be transformative. A little goes a long way for brows. Hair: highly dependent on your hair type and style. . but try and wash the day before the date so it's clean and dry. Hair parting is also HUGE for me. Find your natural parting or one that suits your face shape, and keep that line relatively straight by using a comb to part your hair after a shower. If your hair is frizzy, try to embrace the waves/curls or slick/tie it back to keep it out of the way. Nails: cut your nails at the very least. Nothing is nastier than long unkempt nails imo. Clothes: biggest thing is wear something you're comfortable and relatively confident in. Make sure it's not wrinkly, stained, or stinky and you're golden. From one awkward girl to another, try your best to lean into your awkwardness and laugh about it if things you say/do don't land. You may be disgusted and uncomfortable about it, but trust me when I say some people do find it endearing and charming. I used to see myself the same way you see yourself, but multiple people in the past few years have told me that my awkwardness was their favorite thing about me/it was a big part of my charm lol. Like the other commenter said, try reframing your mindset or consider therapy if you can't. Ugly is very subjective. Something ugly to one person can be extremely beautiful to another and vice versa. You'd be surprised at what some folks find attractive. Good luck!! I know it feels so scary now but try to enjoy and have fun. First dates are not meant to be super serious. Even if the date is bad or awkward, you'll have a funny date story to look back on in the future.","Lol long response incoming: Since you still have some time, try to experiment and see what you feel most confident and comfortable with.

Always apply hyaluronic acid after washing your skin especially while your skin is still damp for maximum absorbtion. Ps. Make sure to use a gentle face wash so it's not stripping your skin of moisture. For face wash I use Anua Hyaluronic Acid 8+ Panthenol face wash. All of this can be found on Amazon.

Another brand I recommend for SPF is the Beauty of Joseon Daily Relief Sunscreen or The Nyx Sunscreen/primer for a good sticky base that has sun protection and if you're on the go and not wearing any sunscreen the e.l.f sun stick is a good option.","I recommend Saturday Skin Glacier Water Cream and some hyaluronic acid serum from the following brands: COSRX, The Ordinary or e.l.f Triple Bounce serum.

n1tbnv5,  I've been looking for something like this too! My skin is super dry and acne prone and this is the only base product that actually looks skin like and doesn't cling to my healing acne or dry patches. I have kinda given up finding a foundation that's similar and just do the following now: Best thing I have found is more base prep than anything else to help the concealer do the most. - I use the dewytree hydrating face mask with aha and hyloronic acid ( they come in a box of 30 for like £10) on olive young/ tkmaxx /amazon - any hydrating Korean suncream ( beauty of Joseon or skin 1004 are the best I've found) - and then colour correct with the saem concealer pot for dark circles and acne marks then use the nyx concealer on top and a darker nyx concealer for contour. Also a good tip for application is using one of those triangle flat wet spongy air puffs for application in a patting motion ( idk what they're called but I got mine for super cheap from Primark).

n1tmsj9,"  I really like the Nyx skin tint with spf. BUT. A skin tint with spf WILL NOT give you enough spf protection throughout the day. You need to apply 1/4 teaspoon of spf on your face and neck. But I love it as a skin tint regardless of the spf. I just don't want people to think that they're getting protection bc of it. I have an Ilia one and this smokes it performance wise. I've converted to the One/Size setting powder. I've tried Elf, L'Oreal, Huda, Hourglass, Laura Mercier (one of the worst for a cakey finish) and O/S or Kimchi (I think they're mostly online) give me the best and longest wear. I like Huda a lot, but it doesn't give me all day. You can get the sample sizes that will last forever to try them out. Halo glow is gorgeous on the skin but looks weird on my forehead... I don't know how to describe it other than that lol. I don't recall wear time on it. For bronzer. . I love the liquid Mario one. I'm kinda meh on his other products but love that. I recently got the Nyx one and she's great too, but you just have to be so careful to not over apply bc it is so pigmented it ends up being a lot of work. LOVE Juvias place for a matte bronzer. I'm very pale and it is one of the few bronzers that really works for me. (the Nyx fairest shade is orange, so I did have to go second lightest to get a bronzed color). Blush... Can't go wrong with elf! I also love the Juvias place liquids (especially their blush lighter) but it's like Rare Beauty pigmented lol. If you want to go online I love all things Moira as well. Maybelline Sky High is my favorite, with Tarte tubing (purple bottle) a close second. I rotate between the two pretty frequently. I'm 43, so the trick with concealer is less is more. Do not swipe it on your face like a lot of influencers do. I dab it on the back of my hand, then use the tiny sponges From real techniques to apply. Let it dry, pat out any creases, then set with powder. Eyeshadow. . Colourpop and Nyx are great. I'm very hooded and oily. I prime, powder, eyeshadow, bake, then top with a sparkly shade. Get crazy long wear since I started baking my first layer of shadow. Put it on heavy since the bake will lighten the color. I like the Mac primer (not the pots... Zero stars on the pots), Thank Me Later by Elizabeth Mott (cheap on Amazon) and Urban Decay in that order. Okay I wrote a novel. If you only take one thing from this... Sunscreen. Sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen. 1/4 tsp. You just keep rubbing it til it works into your skin.

1ludsxs,"  I turn red in the face and I'm struggling to cover it up properly and effectively. So, for some context as to how this began: I started a medication last Christmas and with every medication comes their side effects as most would know. I didn't know that my medication would stop me from sweating as it was always cold in the house because it was winter, but once it started getting warmer, my face would turn red often even from the littlest bit of warmth. And I know some might say that's normal and unavoidable, but I've never had it happen as often and as severe as this. In previous years, including last year, my cheeks were the only part on my face that would frequently turn red from warmth. Nowadays, my medication causes my face to turn red when I'm even just a little bit too warm. The only way to help battle the redness without makeup (and also because I'm literally too overheated to function) is to cool myself down with air conditioning because nothing else helps. The reason I'm making this post is because I have been struggling with makeup lately to help cover up my redness (oftentimes before it happens), especially when I'm leaving the house. I've never turned this red before, and even if I did, it was usually only on my cheeks, not my entire face like it is nowadays thanks to the medication… I have dry and sensitive skin, and not a lot of products have worked for me, but for a couple months now, I have been using Jason Wu's Tinted Moisturizer Meets CC Cream and it's been the best base makeup product I've used in years! I've also switched from putting the green shade from the NYX Color Corrector palette all over my face (exhausting because it takes forever to work into the skin) to recently using Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Color Correcting Concealer (because I use their normal Age Rewind Concealer and I've loved it since forever). I have also purchased the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer since someone I know recommended it for my situation, but I haven't tried it yet since I don't understand how it helps… And no, this post isn't just me rambling about my struggles with makeup. I'm here asking for help from those who may have experience with these products, this situation, or those who have professional makeup advice for me. There's a few issues I've been having with my makeup lately: 1. I've found that sometimes touching my face will take my tinted moisturizer right off, or if my nail presses ever so slightly onto my skin, that it'll remove the makeup in that exact area. I've tried to combat this by setting my face with the only setting powder I own, which is one from E.L.F. I just don't remember the name. I've only done this method once and it seemed to have helped but I'm unsure about how much it helped. 2. If I don't apply enough of my chosen colour corrector (remember, I still haven't tried the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer yet) underneath my tinted moisturizer, then my redness will shine through later on and it makes me feel horrible about myself (I know many people have rosacea and other skin conditions that can cause mass redness, but I'm just remaining honest on how my type of redness makes me feel, so please don't take any offence as I don't mean any…). 3. To conclude this, I'm also heavily struggling with how to make this whole process simpler and less stress-inducing because I'm oftentimes trying to cover my redness before it actually appears, so I cannot tell how much green will help combat the red. Sometimes I've used too little and later my redness peeked through my makeup, or I've used too much and I've had to put on a lot of tinted moisturizer to cover it. It was also my first time using setting powder because I was scared it would cause me to dry out because of my skin type. I just need some advice… If anyone has any questions regarding what I mentioned, then please ask. I'd like to get some feedback and suggestions from anyone who is familiar with this or knows, professionally, how to help. I'm also on a tight budget as I barely make any money nowadays, so purchasing luxury beauty products or pricy items is something I'd very much like to avoid unless there's no other way. Sorry for this jumble of stuff. I've just been so frustrated lately and I've gotten very tired of spending a lot of time looking up how to help with these things and coming up with nothing, either because the advice found didn't help or wasn't the right solution to my problem. Thank you. ***TL;DR: I've been turning red in the face from a medication I take that stops me from sweating (meaning I cannot cool myself down). I'm struggling to both cover this up and maintain my makeup without it smudging off or rubbing off by a small tap to the face. Products mentioned: - Jason Wu's Tinted Moisturizer Meets CC Cream (my base product) - NYX Color Corrector Palette (used to use their green shade to cover my whole face) - Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Color Correcting Concealer (currently use to cover the red underneath my tinted moisturizer) - E.L.F.

My reccos are nyx (from amazon-takes a month to get shipped from New york, but I got the shade espresso at 780/- ish), or elf lip liners, and more high end ones can be brought from mac (chestnut and root for me are my favs) Next, try out Laura mercier banana/honey powder(very mattifying), maybelline fit me compact, kay beauty loose powder are my trusted ones. Kaybeauty loose powder is very fine and is nice for under eyes imo. Same with Laura mercier but can look drying at first. (I'm shade nc46 in mac and this powder works) I think its the shade honey/banana, I'm not sure. Just get the mini version. And maybelline fit me compact matches my undertone well. Trusty powder and looks natural, not too matte like LM powder. But if you have super oily skin (my nose gets SUPER oily) you have to re-apply at least at noon. And I also have the MUR banana powder but didn't use it as much. If you are around my shade the lip liners shades I mentioned can work for you. And MUR banana powder and LM powder work for a wide variety of skin tones unless you are too pale/cool toned) One trick I use is: sunscreen, matte primer on oily areas, then mattifying powder all over those oily areas, and then my usual makeup. Works good imo atleast for me. I dont reapply anything Cuz I go to college Or, just get the BOJ rice sunstick. SUPER MATTIFYING. This sunstick acts as a primer, this paired with LM powder will be super matte istg. The sunstick shouldn't be your sole sun protection tho. Apply suncreen and then the sunstick as a matte primer. So my final reccs for oily skin: BOJ sunstick LM powder","Get a good lipliner.

mov_21A545BA0FC170CB96BF294C9FE5A8F1,"  Selena Gomez's Rare Beauty is expanding its palette of lip products with a line of translucent gloss, the first of its kind for the brand. In a rebellious “Spring Breakers“-themed campaign posted on Monday, the makeup and body care company unveiled the new Positive Light Luminizing Lip Gloss collection, available in six shades: Dazzle, Beam, Flicker, Glimmer, Spark and Blaze, priced at $20 each. “I wanted to create a lip gloss that feels really good and has a ton of shimmer. It's just so fun to wear,” Gomez said in the press release. The fun-loving spirit of the shimmery product was captured in the punky campaign, inspired by the 2012 thriller in which Gomez starred alongside Vanessa Hudgens, Ashley Benson, Rachel Korine and James Franco. Images shared on Instagram showed a robber in a pink ski mask holding a tube of the luminizing gloss with a sign that read, “Selena Gomez I Got Your Gloss.” Other videos featured the character driving away in a golf cart at night, leaving their lips lathered in the glistening product, visible in the moonlight. The formula of the gloss is designed to leave a lasting finish with notes of a subtle peach flavor. Though it's not a lip plumper, the shimmer creates the illusion of fuller, hydrated lips. Dazzle and Flicker are the only shades with blue undertones, while Beam and Glimmer boast warm pink and rose gold hues. Spark and Blaze, on the other hand, are infused with brown and bronze tones. Rare Beauty's product expansion hasn't slowed since its initial launch in 2020. Founded originally as a makeup brand, Rare Beauty moved into body care in 2023, dropping lotions, exfoliants, body washes, mists and creams. Before anything launched, Gomez tapped chief executive officer Scott Friedman, who subsequently brought on chief digital officer Mehdi Mehdi and chief product development officer Joyce Kim — all three NYX Cosmetics alums. “I basically said, 'I want people that have been doing this for so long, who are willing to take a chance and take this journey with me,'” Gomez told WWD in 2021 of building her ideal team. On working with Gomez to formulate a vision for the brand, Mehdi previously told WWD: “We really tried to absorb as much as we could about what makes [Gomez] so special and why people love her so much and that's kind of where the essence started. In terms of the creative, we took a lot of inspiration from the looks that she's done, the makeup that she's done, the fashion that she's done, her music videos, her personal aesthetic.” Rare Beauty's mission to drive conversations and provide services for mental health awareness, with a focus on underserved communities, is also at the heart of the business through its nonprofit counterpart, the Rare Impact Fund. One percent of all Rare Beauty sales go to the Rare Impact Fund. The goal is to raise $100 million over 10 years.

Founded originally as a makeup brand, Rare Beauty moved into body care in 2023, dropping lotions, exfoliants, body washes, mists and creams. Before anything launched, Gomez tapped chief executive officer Scott Friedman, who subsequently brought on chief digital officer Mehdi Mehdi and chief product development officer Joyce Kim — all three NYX Cosmetics alums. “I basically said, 'I want people that have been doing this for so long, who are willing to take a chance and take this journey with me,'” Gomez told WWD in 2021 of building her ideal team. On working with Gomez to formulate a vision for the brand, Mehdi previously told WWD: “We really tried to absorb as much as we could about what makes [Gomez] so special and why people love her so much and that's kind of where the essence started. In terms of the creative, we took a lot of inspiration from the looks that she's done, the makeup that she's done, the fashion that she's done, her music videos, her personal aesthetic.” Rare Beauty's mission to drive conversations and provide services for mental health awareness, with a focus on underserved communities, is also at the heart of the business through its nonprofit counterpart, the Rare Impact Fund. One percent of all Rare Beauty sales go to the Rare Impact Fund. The goal is to raise $100 million over 10 years.

Hun skal snart giftes, men inden da jonglerer hun med mange bolde som både skuespiller, instruktør og manuskriptforfatter. Min morgenrutine består af … at meditere i 10 minutter, bælle et glas iskoldt vand med D-vitamin og lege Usain Bolt for at nå toget. At pleje min hud betyder for mig … at dyrke min kvindelighed, som jeg til tider tilsidesætter for at være i visse rum.  Jeg prøver virkelig at give mig selv den omsorg og kærlighed, jeg fortjener. Jeg lægger makeup, når … jeg skal arbejde udenfor hjemmet. Jeg elsker at have en bar hud, så jeg lægger kun foundation, når jeg skal til store møder eller events. Pudder bruger jeg aldrig, da jeg er mere til sund og fugtet fremfor mat hud. Min makeuprutine er … til ære for ”æblekinder”.  Noget jeg plejede at hade ved mig selv. Jeg smiler og griner nemlig virkelig meget og højt, så mine kinder passer heller ikke til nogen solbriller. Så hvorfor ikke fremhæve netop det, der vil ses?  Mit signaturlook laves med en billig øjenbrynsblyant fra Normal og NYX Brow Glue, så mit pande-hår ikke forvirrer hårene. En mini ”Love the Lift”- Sephora-mascara, og den bedste melting blush i kongeriget fra Rare Beauty, hvor jeg bruger nuancen Nearly Berry. Kan huske, hvor vildt det var for mig for fem år siden at opdage, at lilla, som jeg var uvenner med, ser lyserødt ud på min hud. Jeg plejer mit hår med … rosmarinolie, som styrker håret, og Manuka Honey fra Shea Moisture, som reparerer og giver vildt meget lækker fugt. Hvis jeg kunne sige en ting til mine medsøstre, ville det være …  dyrk din kvindelighed. Og bliv bedre til at spørge kvinder, der ikke ligner dig, hvad deres forhold er til deres kvindelighed. Jeg tror, vi kan lære rigtig meget om hinanden og vores aftryk på verden i de samtaler. Den bedste duft for mig er … min mands læber, uanset hvad han har spist. Kikset, men cute. Når jeg skal have smilet frem, lytter jeg til … 'I Wanna Be Your Lover' af Prince, som jeg lige har genopdaget. Den gør mig ”bubbly” og er fantastisk at høre på vej til arbejde. Jeg føler mig som ”Pop Rocks” hver gang – det der slik fra barndommen, som popper og kilder på tungen. That's me! Thank you, Prince. May the master rest in peace. Hvis min hud slår ud, er mit trick at … stoppe sukkerindtaget, trække vejret og putte de der små dutter på – Master Patches. De er så gode! Det bedste skønhedstip, jeg nogensinde har fået … fik jeg af min mor, og det var at smile. ”Det skaber kun gode rynker.” Det mærkeligste produkt, jeg har på badeværelseshylden … er ikke så mærkeligt, men mere end tomt. Det er en gammel Ole Henriksen Facial Sauna Scrub, som var virkelig god. Aner ikke, hvorfor jeg ikke bare smider den ud.  Den dufter stadig godt. Hvis jeg kunne give mit unge jeg et skønhedsråd, ville det være … spis dine yndlingsfrugter, når du er træt eller har lyst til sukker. Tak mig senere. Luksus for mig er … at have en høj forbrænding. Jeg spiser ikke kartofler med brun sovs, men bruns sovs med kartofler, tak. Hvis jeg kunne ændre en ting i 2025, ville det være … den anti-antidiskriminerende bevægelse, der er i gang. Ingen har godt af den i sidste ende, slet ikke børn og den unge generation, men det er ærgerligt, hvor meget der skal til, før alle forstår det. Det sted, jeg er i livet netop nu, er … et sted, hvor jeg synes, jeg formår at være mere nærværende med min familie og venner trods rejser, arbejde og en hjerne, som er konduktør på 27 tog på én gang.  Det er den helt store udfordring, når man går fra job til karriere, og jeg har virkelig øvet mig i at trække vejret ved bl.a. at meditere. Og hold op, hvor er det rart og ikke mindst respektfuldt at slukke for deadlines og dyrke samværet. Nutidens skønhedsideal er … ikke noget, jeg vil gå op i.

Decoding the Distribution Network: Where to Find Your NYX Fix Finding NYX isn't difficult, but the extent of their product line can vary depending on the retailer.

They typically stock a comprehensive selection, including new releases, limited edition collections, and a wide range of colors and shades. Ulta also frequently offers promotions and discounts on NYX products, making it a great place to snag a bargain. Crucially, Ulta's knowledgeable beauty advisors can provide assistance with shade matching and product recommendations, enhancing the overall shopping experience. Target: Accessibility and Convenience Target provides excellent accessibility for NYX shoppers. Their stores carry a curated selection of the brand's most popular items, like lip products, foundations, and eyeshadow palettes. Target's convenience is a major draw, especially for those already making a shopping trip for other household necessities. Keep an eye out for Target's “beauty boxes” which sometimes feature NYX products, providing a chance to try new items at a reduced cost. Drugstore Options: CVS and Walgreens CVS and Walgreens offer a convenient option for picking up NYX products while running errands. While their selection might be more limited than Ulta or Target, you can still find essential items like mascaras, lipsticks, and basic complexion products. Both CVS and Walgreens often have rotating promotions and loyalty programs that can provide additional savings on your NYX purchases. Walmart: Budget-Friendly Beauty Walmart offers NYX at competitive prices, making it a great option for budget-conscious consumers.

Authentic NYX products typically have a batch code printed on the packaging, which can be used to verify the product's origin. FAQ 4: Does NYX Ever Have Sales or Promotions? Yes, NYX frequently offers sales and promotions throughout the year. Keep an eye out for seasonal sales, holiday promotions, and special offers on their website and at authorized retailers. Signing up for the NYX email list or following them on social media is a great way to stay informed about upcoming deals. Ulta Beauty also regularly includes NYX products in their “21 Days of Beauty” event and other promotions.

En la era del Zoom, del TikTok en pijama y del “beauty for fun”, tener una paleta versátil, potente y fácil de usar no es un lujo —es una necesidad creativa. Y justo ahí entra la Ultimate Shadow Palette de NYX, que por 11 euros en Amazon durante el Prime Day, te ofrece 16 tonos que pueden ir del look neutro de oficina al neón festivalero sin cambiar de estuche. Y sin arruinar tu cuenta bancaria. NYX no necesita presentación: es una de esas marcas que supo ocupar el espacio entre el maquillaje profesional y el asequible con actitud. Pero la Ultimate Shadow Palette se ha convertido en algo más: una pieza básica, como los Levi's 501 del beauty. No importa si maquillas por pasión, trabajo o por puro juego; esta paleta cumple. Y cumple bien. Lo que la hace única no es solo la variedad de tonos —que van desde mates sólidos hasta satinados con destellos sutiles— sino la calidad de su pigmentación. No necesitas hacer capas infinitas para que el color se note, ni cargar la brocha como si fueras a pelear. Neutrogena tiene el limpiador facial que todos aman, aprovecha la oferta en Amazon     La crema facial con SPF 50: tu mejor compra en el Prime Day de Amazon, sin discusión     El limpiador facial bifásico de Amazon que limpia profundamente y tu piel agradece Además, la textura es fácil de trabajar: se difumina bien, se adhiere sin primer (aunque con uno mejora, claro), y no se convierte en polvo flotante a la mínima. Cada tono tiene intención, algo raro en paletas económicas donde sobran sombras “de relleno”. Y si hablamos de estilo, esta paleta es un moodboard portátil. Puedes hacer un ahumado clásico con marrones y negros, un halo eye con verdes metálicos, un toque de amarillo para editorializar tu párpado o simplemente una línea de color inesperado. Todo cabe en esta caja, menos el aburrimiento. ¿Vale más que algunas paletas de alta gama? No necesariamente. Pero por 11 euros, la relación calidad-estética-precio es imbatible. Mientras otras marcas venden 5 sombras a 50 euros con discurso poético, NYX te da 16 colores y te deja hacer poesía tú misma. Ultimate Shadow Palette de NYX no pretende cambiar tu vida. Pero sí puede cambiar tu mirada. Y por 11 euros en Prime Day, es una de esas compras que no solo valen la pena —valen cada pigmento. @mundistyle","SPR_COMBO[es]El maquillaje de ojos, alguna vez símbolo de sofisticación distante, se ha vuelto un manifiesto de libertad.

Y por 33 euros durante Prime Day, eso ya es una victoria cotidiana para cualquiera con piel reactiva, sensible o simplemente harta del “más es más”. La marca británica Elemis no juega al hype: apuesta por la sensorialidad, la ciencia botánica y la elegancia silenciosa. Y este limpiador es una muestra exacta de esa filosofía. No hace espuma tipo detergente. No huele a perfume barato. No reseca. No irrita. No hace “efecto wow” porque no lo necesita. Este es un gel que limpia sin arrasar. Ideal para pieles que ya han pasado por exfoliaciones excesivas, climas agresivos, o simplemente por productos mal elegidos que dejaron más preguntas que respuestas. Su fórmula contiene: – Extracto de tomillo y camomila, calmantes clásicos pero vigentes. – Aceite de lavanda, suave y equilibrante. – Base limpiadora de origen vegetal, no agresiva, que respeta el pH y la barrera cutánea. Ni hype, ni glitter: esta brocha con rebaja en Amazon te da lo que las otras solo prometen     Por qué este labial mate de Amazon sigue derrotando a todos los glosses virales     NYX en Amazon: la paleta de 11 euros que hace más que muchas de 60 ¿El resultado?

Y aunque está pensado para pieles sensibles, no es un producto “light” o ineficaz. Retira impurezas, restos de maquillaje liviano, polución y grasa sin desmontar el rostro. Si lo acompañas con una doble limpieza o una muselina, funciona incluso como primer paso de rutina nocturna. Elemis Sensitive Cleansing Face Wash no te va a cambiar la vida. Pero va a cambiar cómo se siente tu piel después de limpiarla.

Y no todas se dejan domar con lápiz o sombra. Algunas piden más. O exigen, directamente. Ahí es donde entra el Fijador de Cejas de Larga Duración de NYX Professional Makeup, ese producto que, sin mucha publicidad ni drama, logra que tus cejas se queden exactamente donde las dejaste. Y ahora, por solo 12 euros en Amazon durante Prime Day, se vuelve un básico sin excusas. Hay fijadores que brillan más que tus párpados. Hay otros que prometen duración y desaparecen antes del almuerzo. Y luego está este de NYX, que ni brilla, ni se desintegra, ni necesita doble capa para funcionar. Su fórmula transparente y ligera tiene la fijación de un gel deportivo, pero sin rigidez. Se desliza fácil con su cepillo tipo spoolie, se seca rápido y no deja residuos ni esas bolitas blancas que convierten tu maquillaje en una traición. Y sí, resiste la jornada completa. Oficina, baile, calor, humedad. Tus cejas se mantienen firmes como si tuvieran contrato de permanencia. ¿Funciona para todo tipo de cejas? ✔️ Gruesas y rebeldes: las peina, levanta y fija. ✔️ Delgadas o poco pobladas: no las apelmaza y da efecto de volumen si las peinas hacia arriba. ✔️ Naturales: si no las maquillas, también sirve como gel de orden y brillo suave. No es tendencia, es resultado: el tratamiento antiedad que está arrasando en Prime Day     Frizz, resequedad, opacidad: tres problemas, una solución de 17 euros en Amazon     Piel luminosa sin maquillaje: así actúan las ampollas de Amazon en 3 minutos Este fijador es también una herramienta de diseño: puedes usarlo para lograr efecto “laminado”, despeinado editorial o estructura pulida. Es decir, no solo fija. Construye la actitud de tu ceja y eso, por 12 euros, no está nada mal. Lo mejor es que no huele a producto químico ni deja sensación plástica. No te das cuenta de que lo llevas puesto, y eso es justo lo que uno espera de un buen gel: que trabaje sin hacerse notar. El Fijador de Cejas Larga Duración de NYX no viene a inventar nada nuevo. Pero sí ejecuta lo básico con precisión quirúrgica. Y cuando hablamos de cejas, eso es más valioso que cualquier envoltorio dorado. A 12 euros en Prime Day, este gel es una inversión sensata para que tu cara diga lo que tú quieres —y no lo que decida el clima, el espejo o el paso de las horas. @mundistyle","SPR_COMBO[es]Las cejas ya no son solo un detalle.
