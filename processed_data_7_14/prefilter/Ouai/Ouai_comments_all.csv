1c290000133046f218a07e54573bb10d,"  L'Oréal's Color Wow Acquisition: A Bold Move in the Premium Haircare Race L'Oréal's June 2025 acquisition of Color Wow marks a pivotal moment in the beauty industry's push toward premiumization and consolidation. By securing a brand synonymous with salon-quality haircare, L'Oréal aims to fortify its position in a high-margin segment primed for growth. This move not only underscores the French giant's strategic agility but also signals escalating competition in the premium haircare market—a space where niche players once thrived unchallenged. Why the Premium Haircare Market Matters The global haircare market is projected to exceed $60 billion by 2028, with premium products capturing the fastest growth. Consumers, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are increasingly willing to pay a premium for science-backed, efficacy-driven products that deliver visible results. Color Wow's reputation as a “stylist's favorite” aligns perfectly with this trend, offering L'Oréal access to a loyal customer base and a portfolio of award-winning formulas like its Root Cover Up Powder and Dream Coat spray. Strategic Rationale: A Triple Win for L'Oréal Premium Segment Dominance: Color Wow's $300 million revenue (doubling in three years) and 40–60% profit margins highlight the profitability of premium haircare. L'Oréal's Professional Products Division, which generated €4.89 billion in 2024, now gains a foothold in styling and color correction—categories with double-digit growth rates.Omnichannel Synergy: Color Wow's hybrid distribution model (salons, Sephora, Amazon) complements L'Oréal's global retail network. By expanding Color Wow's presence in Asia and Europe, L'Oréal can capitalize on untapped markets where premium haircare demand is soaring.R&D & Innovation Boost: L'Oréal's $1.5 billion annual R&D investment can accelerate Color Wow's pipeline, while cost efficiencies from shared supply chains could improve margins further. Valuation: Paying a Premium for Growth While the exact purchase price remains undisclosed, industry sources suggest a valuation near $1 billion, implying a 25–30x EV/EBITDA multiple (Color Wow's EBITDA is estimated at $33–40 million). This aligns with L'Oréal's own 18.9x EV/EBITDA multiple, which is elevated compared to the broader CPG sector but justified by its scale and innovation. Risks and Competing Forces - Niche Brand Threats: Smaller players like IGK Hair or Ouai, which emphasize affordability and social media-savvy branding, could erode L'Oréal's premium positioning unless it maintains its innovation edge. - Sustainability Pressure: Rising demand for eco-friendly products (e.g., Unilever's Wild brand) forces L'Oréal to balance premium pricing with green initiatives. - Market Saturation: Over-indexing on premium haircare could backfire if demand softens in mature markets like North America, where tariffs already pressured sales in 2024. Investment Takeaways: Buy, Hold, or Wait? L'Oréal's stock trades at €372.60, well above analysts' fair value estimates of €208.78–€236.69. While this suggests near-term overvaluation, the Color Wow deal reinforces its long-term moat in premium beauty. Key considerations: - Upside Catalysts: Continued growth in SAPMENA-SSA (South Asia, Africa) and successful integration of Color Wow's brand identity. - Downside Risks: Margin pressure from tariffs, slower-than-expected premium segment adoption, or a shift toward budget-friendly alternatives. Final Recommendation Hold for the Long Term, but Be Selective Near-Term: L'Oréal's fundamentals—diversified revenue streams, geographic reach, and financial discipline—support its valuation. However, investors should wait for a pullback to the €200–€250 range before accumulating shares. Monitor Q2 earnings for signs of margin recovery and Color Wow's contribution to sales. For aggressive investors, consider a partial allocation now, hedged against sector volatility. In a beauty market increasingly defined by premiumization and consolidation, L'Oréal's move on Color Wow is a masterstroke—unless the next disruptor outpaces them in sustainability or affordability. The jury's still out, but L'Oréal's track record of turning niche brands into global juggernauts suggests this bet will pay off. Data as of June 2025. Always consult a financial advisor before making investment decisions.

It's the longest sale the mega-retailer has ever done, and the discounts are, as always, a doozy. For the last few weeks, I have been combing through thousands of beauty deals, and have come out the other side with the 59 best skin care, makeup, body care, and hair care must-haves you should shop before the sale ends. The lowest prices begin with a $4 body exfoliating brush that I consider necessary for smooth summer skin, and on the most expensive side, Shark's rarely-on-sale hair styler (which I've never seen this cheap before). You'll also find under-the-radar picks (Dearcloud's serum blush), top-rated products (L'Oreal's Lumi Glotion skin enhancer), celebrity-used favorites (Laura Geller's baked foundation), my go-tos (Medicube's exosome serum), and much more. Best Deals Overall It was hard enough to pare this list down to 59 products, and even more difficult to single out the nine best, but here they are. There are things like Laneige's lip mask and Cosrx's snail mucin serum that you should always stock up on during sales, plus celebrity favorites like NuFace's microcurrent device, Naturium's body butter, and Supergoop's tinted primer. Naturium Skin-Renewing Retinol Body Lotion Amazon Naturium's body care is next-level, which has made fans of Hailey Bieber, Demi Moore and me. I'm going to pass on my usual order to try out this retinol body lotion. Besides the titular ingredient, there's allatonin and shea butter; it's an anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, cell-renewing, radiance-enhancing, moisturizing (whew) combination. Best Anti-Aging Skin Care Deals I know that everyone has different skin care concerns, but to paint with a broad brush, it's safe to say a lot of people are concerned with reducing and/or preventing signs of aging. As such, I have meticulously picked the 10 best on-sale anti-aging products for everything wrinkle, fine lines, and firmness-related. On the cheapest end of the spectrum, there's a $12 Medicube serum, and the most expensive—yet still incredibly affordable—is a $35 Eight Saints Eye Cream. L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer, $21 (Originally $30) Womaness Let's Neck Firming Serum, $26 (Originally $35) CeraVe Skin Renewing Anti-Aging Retinol Serum, $23 (Originally $25) Nakery Lift-Tox Night Repair and Firm Cream, $20 (Originally $35) Body Firm Crepe Erase Ultra-Reparative Hand Cream, $20 (Originally $26) Gold Bond Age Renew Retinol Overnight Body and Face Lotion, $14 (Originally $17) Medicube Salmon DNA PDRN Pink Peptide Serum, $15 (Originally $22) Medicube One Day Exosome Shot 2,000 Serum, $12 (Originally $39) Eight Saints Wonder-fill Plumping Eye Cream, $35 (Originally $44) CeraVe Skin Renewing Anti-Aging Retinol Serum Amazon If you have a singular anti-aging skin care product in your routine, it should be formulated with retinol. CeraVe's Skin Renewing Anti-Aging Retinol Serum is a great choice because when it comes time for a restock, at $23, it's still a steal. The titular retinol is a wrinkle-reducing, dark spot-fading, and skin-firming powerhouse. It's complemented by a trio of plumping ceramides and ultra-hydrating hyaluronic acid. One shopper said that their “forehead had deep lines” that were visible even when they weren't  “creasing [their] brow.” After a month of using this they noted they “can't see them” anymore. Medicube Salmon DNA PDRN Pink Peptide Serum Amazon This feels like a line from Saturday Night Live, but it's true: salmon sperm skin care is everywhere. This Medicube serum uses bits of DNA derived from the stuff and for more than just shock value. It improves firmness, texture, and hydration, and fast. This formula also includes niacinamide and vitamin C-rich holy basil, a duo that has wrinkle-filling and skin-brightening properties. A shopper in their late 60s “loves the way this has made [their] face look” by making wrinkles look “less noticeable.” Best Hair Growth Deals If you want perpetually long, thick, and healthy hair, it means (unless you are genetically gifted) that you must always be searching for and buying hair growth products. To ease the financial strain this may cause, I recommend stocking up during mega-sales like Prime Day. You can go with an obvious choice like the fervently loved Mielle Organics' oil, try a celebrity go-to treatment, or upgrade your shampoo and conditioner routine. Virtue Healing Hair Oil Amazon There is a high probability that this is the most popular hair care product in Hollywood. Off the top of my head, I can tell you its celebrity fans include Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Garner, and Anne Hathaway. This oil helps promote hair growth through a variety of healing (hence its name) ingredients, the most important of which is the brand's proprietary Alpha Keratin 60ku; think of it as a honing system that targets the strands and areas that need it the most....","This year, Amazon Prime Day becomes Amazon Prime Days—you can score deals for four days (instead of two) to be exact, from now to July 11.

If you purchase something from our posts, we may earn a small commission. Grab your wallets—it's officially that time of year again. Amazon's annual Prime Day extravaganza is back, and this time, the so-called 'Black Friday in July' is bigger (and longer) than ever before. For 2025, the epic shopping event runs four days—double the usual two—kicking off Tuesday, July 8, and wrapping up Friday, July 11, at 11 p.m. PT. This means shoppers get 96 hours to snag the best deals across Amazon's virtual aisles. Prime members can expect thousands of markdowns on everything from big-ticket electronics and home upgrades to luxe beauty staples, with major names like LG, Dyson, NuFace, Levi's, Samsung, Peloton, Bissell, and more in the mix. This year also brings a shiny new shopping feature: “Today's Big Deals”—a daily, themed drop of limited-time offers from top brands like Samsung, Kiehl's, and Levi's, launching at midnight and available while supplies last. You do need to be an Amazon Prime member to partake in Prime Day 2025, but if you're not already signed up, Amazon offers a free 30-day trial, so you can score the deals without committing right away (otherwise, it's $14.99/month or $139/year).

Below, browse a handful of great deals on the Bravoleb's go-to activewear, skincare and makeup, but don't delay: Prime Day only runs through July 11. Page Six's Picks Amazon Richards called EltaMD “the best sunblock for the face” in an Amazon Live, and she's far from the brand's only famous fan; Hailey Bieber, Kourtney Kardashian, Kendall Jenner and Brooke Shields are all Team EltaMD, too. (As are multiple Page Six Style staffers.) Peter Thomas Roth “You know how much I love these,” Richards said of her “fave” eye patches during an Amazon Live, saying they “just [make] such a big difference.” Medicube The Bravoleb said these AHA-fueled pads “open your pores, but also let the products you're putting on top of it really penetrate.” The Gym People “They fit really well [and] make the butt look good,” Richards said of these leggings in another Live. “The reason they're thicker is to make everything feel held in, which they definitely do. They're very, very, very comfortable.” Ouai Richards discovered this scent when brand founder and celebrity hairstylist Jen Atkin sent her a bottle. “I have her other scents too, but this one is my favorite one,” Richards explained. “All the stuff she does is really, really great.” (Her daughters are also fans, with her eldest Farrah calling North Bondi “beautiful.”) Laneige Like Sydney Sweeney, Brooke Shields and countless beauty editors, Richards swears by this cult-favorite lip product. Though it's called a sleeping mask, fans wear it day and night — and as a lip gloss. It's a big hit on Amazon as well, with over 20,000 shoppers buying it multiple times. Medicube “I am loving — and everyone that I've shared this with is loving — the Medicube Booster tool. I love it, and it works. It reduces pore size, fine lines and helps push the product in,” Richards said in one Live, adding that it makes her feel like she “just had a facial.” Buxom Richards can't stop raving about this lip gloss, revealing on an Amazon Live that she has at least nine different shades. “It was the first lip plumper that I believed actually did something,” the “RHOBH” legend quipped. Nest New York “We love, love, love Nest,” Richards raved during a Mother's Day-themed Live. A favorite of fellow “Housewives” like Bethenny Frankel and Jill Zarin, the brand offers a wide range of elegant, long-lasting scents. Biodance Richards joins Paige DeSorbo, Ciara Miller and thousands of Amazon shoppers in loving these hyaluronic-acid-packed collagen sheet masks that hydrate skin and improve elasticity. TruSkin Richards once called TruSkin's vitamin C serum a “miracle,” saying that she could she could “automatically see a difference” after using it. Laura Gellar The “Real Housewife” can't stop raving about this Laura Geller palette; she's highlighted it in countless livestreams, saying it's “everything you need in one palette.” Prime Day FAQs, answered When is Prime Day 2025?

During the sale, Prime members can score epic discounts on thousands of products. I've already taken advantage of the best beauty deals—from a TikTok-viral lip stain to an iconic hair treatment, and more—but now, I'm focused on all things health and wellness. There are so many can't-miss wellness deals this year. Daily essentials (think sunscreen, collagen powder, electric toothbrushes, and more) are majorly discounted, while expensive tech items (think fitness trackers, massage guns, and under-desk walking pads) are up to 50% off. There's simply no world in which these on-sale items will stay in stock for long, so I suggest acting fast. Keep scrolling to see all 15 Prime Day wellness items I'm snagging while I still can. WALKINGPAD Z1 Foldable Walking Pad Treadmill Deal: 20% off I've wanted a walking pad for SO LONG. As someone who's tied to her desk most days, clacking away on a keyboard, I don't always take as many steps as I'd like. The perfect solution is an under-desk walking pad. Whether I'm researching products, answering emails, or writing about the best Amazon Prime wellness deals (ahem), I'll be able to move my body and stay active. This one is easy to store and move as it folds completely in half, so you can slide it under a bed, sofa, or desk when you're not using it. It's also lightweight (less than 50 lbs!) , and has earned thousands of glowing reviews. Philips Sonicare Diamondclean Smart 9500 Electric Toothbrush Deal: 46% off This is my favorite toothbrush, and it just so happens to be almost 50% off. Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects Teeth Whitening Kit Deal: 35% off Speaking of oral care products, I swear by these teeth-whitening strips for keeping my smile bright despite lots (I mean lots) of coffee drinking. They're way cheaper than in-office whitening treatments, yet they're still effective. Vital Proteins Collagen Peptides Powder Deal: 34% off This grass-fed, pasture-raised bovine collagen powder is full of protein and supports hair, skin, nails, joints, and bone wellness. It's unflavored and mixes easily into both hot and cold beverages, such as water, coffee, and smoothies. LifePro Vibration Plate Deal: 24% off I've seen people use vibration plates on TikTok to encourage relaxation and lymphatic drainage. Apparently, the vibration facilitates lymph flow, thereby keeping the skin bright, the body feeling energized, and puffiness at bay. Seed Ds-01 Daily Synbiotic - Prebiotic and Probiotic Deal: 28% off This is my go-to probiotic. Well, it's actually a synbiotic, meaning it's a prebiotic and probiotic. Translation? It boosts gut health. I take it every morning on an empty stomach. EltaMD UV Daily SPF 40 Face Sunscreen Moisturizer Deal: 20% off Sunscreen isn't just skincare, it's healthcare.

Packed with its titular ingredient, the formula promotes new growth; moreover, it strengthens existing strands to mitigate excessive shedding, prevent premature snapping, and yield longer, healthier-looking hair. The formula's key ingredient, rosemary, boasts benefits beyond the culinary realm. According to science, the herb is equally powerful in the beauty sphere as a growth-proliferating hair care ingredient. Specifically, rosemary extract improves blood flow to the scalp—in turn, providing hair follicles with nutrients and stimulating new growth. Notably, one study even found rosemary to be as effective as minoxidil (the active ingredient in products like Rogaine) for staving off certain forms of hair loss. Nécessaire Rosemary Shampoo With Pump Amazon In addition to fuller, stronger, longer hair, Nécessaire's Rosemary Shampoo softens and smooths—while adding bounce and shine—after a single use. The formula is available in an 8.4-ounce size and a larger 16.9-ounce size, contained in a pump-style bottle. I'm doubling down on rosemary's thickening benefits with the corresponding Nécessaire Rosemary Conditioner. I'd be remiss to omit the olfactory bliss this shampoo emits once lathered: A meld of herbaceous, spa-like notes turns my shower into an instant oasis of calm. Plus, the packaging adds a touch of elegant, cool-girl sophistication to my bathroom. I'm hardly alone in my love for Nécessaire's Rosemary Shampoo. One shopper who had struggled with postpartum hair loss said their “hair is growing back in so rapidly” after three months of using the formula in combination with the corresponding conditioner. Another fan dubbed it an “awesome product for [treating] hair loss,” citing stronger strands and significantly less shedding within three months of incorporating the shampoo into their routine. Finally, another shopper with “thin” hair said their mane feels “thicker” after only a week. For fuller, bouncier, longer hair, shop the Nécessaire Rosemary Shampoo at Amazon before it returns to full price. Consider similar options below.

mov_44929187B8384E2FCCCE2A3C3CAAD8B6,"  Levi Strauss LEVI has a simple strategy to deal with U.S. tariffs: stop offering less-popular styles during the holiday shopping season so they can avoid having to offer discounts to move inventory. The leading maker of jeans and other denim clothes on Thursday lifted its annual profit and revenue forecast, projecting strong demand for new styles and collections including dresses, skirts and wide-legged jeans even as shoppers are economizing due to the climbing prices of most goods. ""We are taking a hard look at productivity in our assortments,"" Levi Strauss' Chief Financial Officer Harmit Singh told Reuters, cutting styles and colors that are not selling, and making way for new product. ""And so, we're reducing our markdowns."" Other companies including toymaker Hasbro HAS are also cutting less-popular lines. That approach has been used before in difficult times such as the pandemic, by Nike NKE for instance. Levi Strauss is focusing on a ""common assortment"" of products, meaning it is producing similar or identical merchandise in various markets, Singh said. This gives Levi Strauss the ""flexibility and the agility to move product around the world,"" he said. U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on countries including China, Cambodia, Vietnam and Bangladesh have forced companies to rethink supply chains and import strategies as goods are often subject to layered tariffs. It could cost tens of thousands of dollars more to clear a shipping container of jeans at customs. This will boost retail prices for shoppers, especially during the crucial holiday shopping period. Levi's operating margin for the latest quarter rose 7.5% from 1.5% a year earlier. Analysts cheered the company's decision to tightly control stock-keeping units, or SKUs, an industry term for inventory. ""Levi's move to reduce non-productive SKUs is a smart and sustainable strategy,"" said Angeli Gianchandani, adjunct instructor at New York University's School of Professional Studies. ""Nike pursued a similar strategy through its ""fewer, bigger, bolder"" approach, which helped simplify assortments ... Brands like Coach and Uniqlo have also benefited from editing down to focus on hero products."" Hasbro said in April that the toymaker was doing a ""significant amount of SKU reduction"" and importing fewer items from China as a defense against tariffs. Hasbro CEO Christian Cocks said: ""We are changing what the SKU mix looks like inside of the aisles for the U.S. so that we can favor India-based SKUs, which maybe are older SKUs but are tried and true."" Smaller vendors who sell on Amazon AMZN are cutting SKUs to offset the impact of paying tariffs and commission fees, and offering sales on discounting events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, analysts said. E-commerce marketing consultancy Front Row, which works with beauty and haircare brands including Unilever's Tatcha and Procter & Gamble's Ouai, said some of its clients reduced the number of products offered for Amazon's 98-hour Prime Day. U.S. retailers drove $7.9 billion during July 8, making the first 24 hours of Prime Day the highest ecommerce shopping day so far this year, according to Adobe Analytics. “A lot of our brands are considering less SKUs,” Front Row Senior Vice President of Commercial Operations Alexandra Carmody said.

mov_2CEE73AED9DDE168E88B82A7B3EBBC2A,"  By Arriana McLymore and Anuja Bharat Mistry NEW YORK (Reuters) -Levi Strauss has a simple strategy to deal with U.S. tariffs: stop offering less-popular styles during the holiday shopping season so they can avoid having to offer discounts to move inventory. The leading maker of jeans and other denim clothes on Thursday lifted its annual profit and revenue forecast, projecting strong demand for new styles and collections including dresses, skirts and wide-legged jeans even as shoppers are economizing due to the climbing prices of most goods. ""We are taking a hard look at productivity in our assortments,"" Levi Strauss' Chief Financial Officer Harmit Singh told Reuters, cutting styles and colors that are not selling, and making way for new product. ""And so, we're reducing our markdowns."" Other companies including toymaker Hasbro are also cutting less-popular lines. That approach has been used before in difficult times such as the pandemic, by Nike for instance. Levi Strauss is focusing on a ""common assortment"" of products, meaning it is producing similar or identical merchandise in various markets, Singh said. This gives Levi Strauss the ""flexibility and the agility to move product around the world,"" he said. U.S. President Donald Trump's tariffs on countries including China, Cambodia, Vietnam and Bangladesh have forced companies to rethink supply chains and import strategies as goods are often subject to layered tariffs. It could cost tens of thousands of dollars more to clear a shipping container of jeans at customs. This will boost retail prices for shoppers, especially during the crucial holiday shopping period. Levi's operating margin for the latest quarter rose 7.5% from 1.5% a year earlier. Analysts cheered the company's decision to tightly control stock-keeping units, or SKUs, an industry term for inventory. ""Levi's move to reduce non-productive SKUs is a smart and sustainable strategy,"" said Angeli Gianchandani, adjunct instructor at New York University's School of Professional Studies. ""Nike pursued a similar strategy through its ""fewer, bigger, bolder"" approach, which helped simplify assortments ... Brands like Coach and Uniqlo have also benefited from editing down to focus on hero products."" Hasbro said in April that the toymaker was doing a ""significant amount of SKU reduction"" and importing fewer items from China as a defense against tariffs.

Analysts cheered the company's decision to tightly control stock-keeping units, or SKUs, an industry term for inventory. “Levi's move to reduce non-productive SKUs is a smart and sustainable strategy,” said Angeli Gianchandani, adjunct instructor at New York University's School of Professional Studies. “Nike pursued a similar strategy through its “fewer, bigger, bolder” approach, which helped simplify assortments … Brands like Coach and Uniqlo have also benefited from editing down to focus on hero products.” Hasbro said in April that the toymaker was doing a “significant amount of SKU reduction” and importing fewer items from China as a defense against tariffs. Hasbro CEO Christian Cocks said: “We are changing what the SKU mix looks like inside of the aisles for the U.S. so that we can favor India-based SKUs, which maybe are older SKUs but are tried and true.” Smaller vendors who sell on Amazon are cutting SKUs to offset the impact of paying tariffs and commission fees, and offering sales on discounting events like Black Friday and Cyber Monday, analysts said.

[embedded content] With over 30 films to her name and plenty of TV credits to match, Faris has proven she's more than just funny — she's personable, self-aware, and charming enough to make normal people think they're interviewing for “the easiest job in the world.” We sat down with her to talk about her Scrubbing Bubbles partnership, her go-to cleaning staples, and her other must-have products.

I was the kind of kid who my mom had me clean the bathroom as one of my chores.
