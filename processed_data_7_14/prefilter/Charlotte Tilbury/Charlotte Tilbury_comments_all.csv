An absolutely genius device called a ""Supoon"" — this perfectly sized spoon not only helps you scrape every last bit of food from the container (think: peanut butter, yogurt, cream cheese, etc.) but also has a unique design that keeps it away from the countertop when you set it down! This is about to prevent SO many ""babe, stop leaving your peanut butter spoon on the counter"" arguments.

Here's a few of the many things I use this dishwasher-safe beauty for — and yep, it makes it into basically every dishwasher load, I use it THAT frequently. - Scraping every last bit of sauce, curry, salad dressing, or soup out of takeout or leftover containers, like in the picture above. This happens several times a week. I want every bit of all that flavor!! - Measuring out a few teaspoons of water when re-steaming takeout rice in the microwave. - Scraping out yogurt, hummus, salsa, hot sauce, peanut butter, expensive Bonne Maman jams, etc., etc., when I'm down to the last little bit of each. (It's too big for most beauty products, but that's fine.) - Mixing together a quick stir-fry sauce in a measuring cup, then scraping that sauce out of the cup into the pan, all with a single utensil. - Scrambling together a mixture of eggs and whatever else I want in a bowl and scraping all of that into a pan. - Scooping pancake batter my MIL sent over into a pan to make my 9-month-old fresh pancakes, including scraping the last bits out to get as much pancake as possible. Like, I know I functioned in the kitchen before I had this, but this saves me so much time scraping over and over with a spoon. And that price! A no-brainer.

18317954479234353,"  SPR_COMBO[de]*Anzeige/ Werbung Ein tolles Produkttest von influenster und der Marke charlottetilbury Ich durfte den neuen #Unreal #Blush von. Charlotte Tilbury in der Farbe Sherry Glow testen – und ich muss sagen: Ich bin wirklich positiv überrascht! Zuerst das Packaging – typisch Charlotte Tilbury: luxuriös, hochwertig und einfach ein Hingucker auf jedem Schminktisch. Der Blush selbst ist ein flüssiges Gel-Cream-Produkt, das sich super einfach mit den Fingern oder einem Pinsel auftragen lässt. Die Textur ist leicht und verschmilzt fast schon mit der Haut – kein Absetzen, kein Fleckigwerden. Die Farbe ""Sherry Glow"" ist ein wunderschöner, warm-rosiger Ton mit einem ganz feinen Glow. Kein grober Glitzer, sondern eher ein natürlich strahlender Schimmer, der dem Gesicht sofort Frische verleiht. Ich finde, der Ton passt besonders gut zu mittleren bis leicht gebräunten Hauttönen – er zaubert diese “frisch-von-der-Sonne-geküsst”-Ausstrahlung. Mein Fazit: Ein tolles Produkt für alle, die den “dewy”, frischen Look lieben! Wer auf natürliche Ausstrahlung steht und Lust auf einen unkomplizierten Sommer-Blush hat, wird mit ""Sherry Glow"" richtig glücklich. Für mich ein echtes Highlight in meiner Sommer-Make-up-Routine obwohl ich eher immer noch zum Puder tendiere. 9 von 10 ⭐ #complimentary #charlottetilbury #unrealblush #influenster #produkttester #testen #blush #rouge #beautyprodukte #luxuriös #cherryglow","SPR_COMBO[de]*Anzeige/ Werbung Ein tolles Produkttest von influenster und der Marke charlottetilbury Ich durfte den neuen von.

The floral maxi dress, which is just £48, is part of Roman's summer collection and would be perfect for park picnics or days out at the beach. And, right now, shoppers can save an extra 10% using the code HAPPY. The dress boasts short sleeves, offering some coverage, an attention-grabbing shirred waist, and a tassel tie detail. There's even a modest slit in the skirt for that extra bit of breeziness, reports Nottingham Post. When it comes to accessorising, the options are endless. Dress it up with sparkling heels and gold trinkets for formal occasions, or pair it with ballet flats and standout sunglasses for casual garden get-togethers. The dress comes in a selection of different patterns, too, including various floral prints and an on-trend polka dot print. The dress comes in sizes 10 to 20. However, several sizes are already sold out in some of the patterns. If your size isn't available, Phase Eight also offers a fantastic range, including this floral maxi dress (£109, originally £189) with long sleeves for a similar feel to the Roman dress. For something different yet equally enchanting, Joe Browns showcases a stunning floral knee-length number (£48), available in both petite and regular sizes. It's designed to highlight the waist and features a delightful V-neckline. Customers have been heaping praise on the Roman Originals light blue dress, with one satisfied buyer exclaiming: ""It's a lovely colour, and the material keeps you cool in this hot weather."" Another happy shopper shared their enthusiasm: ""I love this dress. It fits my size 16, hangs nicely, and looks good with my trainers."" One more pleased customer couldn't hide their delight: ""I just love this dress - I feel amazing in it. When you are a larger person, as I am, it isn't easy to find something you like. The dress flows and gives me a nicer shape. Everyone thought I looked amazing and that I had lost some weight."" Yet, not all reviews were positive, with a dissatisfied customer stating: ""I loved this dress but was very disappointed with the length. It was far too long."" On the other hand, another contented patron praised their find: ""(The dress is) beautiful, a wonderful fit, and a perfect length. I'm 5'7"". When you put on the dress, you feel amazing.

We may earn commission on some of the items you choose to buy. Some shocking news: toners aren't all that necessary. Still, that doesn't mean they're not a good supplementary treatment to have in your skincare regimen, especially if you have chronically dry, dehydrated skin. Since toners are an optional step, if you do choose to use a toner, it should at least check off a few boxes, but one, in particular, is of the most importance: hydration. But what is a toner, anyway? “A toner is a solution that typically contains actives and is designed to be used after cleansing and before moisturizing. Toners can balance pH, remove impurities, exfoliate, and hydrate. They are not necessary, but they can provide great benefits,” says Dr. Blair Murphy-Rose, a board-certified dermatologist at Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York and clinical instructor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College. For those with dry skin, “the benefits of a toner depend on the specific formulation and the ingredients it contains. Many toners contain exfoliating actives that help to improve tone and texture, reduce dullness, diminish hyperpigmentation, and bring a glow to the skin,” she adds. Toners made specifically for dry skin can “hydrate, balance pH, and remove residual oils.” Best Calming Toner ANUA Heartleaf 77 Soothing Toner Read more Best Toner for Beginners CeraVe Hydrating Toner Read more Best for Gentle Exfoliation Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant Read more While your TikTok and Instagram bookmark tab is likely chock-full of toners on your wishlist, we did the hard work for you by combing through dozens of online customer reviews and our personal stash to find the 12 best toners for dry skin.

Still, that doesn't mean they're not a good supplementary treatment to have in your skincare regimen, especially if you have chronically dry, dehydrated skin. Since toners are an optional step, if you do choose to use a toner, it should at least check off a few boxes, but one, in particular, is of the most importance: hydration. But what is a toner, anyway? “A toner is a solution that typically contains actives and is designed to be used after cleansing and before moisturizing. Toners can balance pH, remove impurities, exfoliate, and hydrate. They are not necessary, but they can provide great benefits,” says Dr. Blair Murphy-Rose, a board-certified dermatologist at Laser & Skin Surgery Center of New York and clinical instructor of dermatology at Weill Cornell Medical College. For those with dry skin, “the benefits of a toner depend on the specific formulation and the ingredients it contains. Many toners contain exfoliating actives that help to improve tone and texture, reduce dullness, diminish hyperpigmentation, and bring a glow to the skin,” she adds. Toners made specifically for dry skin can “hydrate, balance pH, and remove residual oils.” Best Calming Toner ANUA Heartleaf 77 Soothing Toner Read more Best Toner for Beginners CeraVe Hydrating Toner Read more Best for Gentle Exfoliation Paula's Choice Skin Perfecting 6% Mandelic Acid + 2% Lactic Acid Liquid Exfoliant Read more While your TikTok and Instagram bookmark tab is likely chock-full of toners on your wishlist, we did the hard work for you by combing through dozens of online customer reviews and our personal stash to find the 12 best toners for dry skin.

mov_F4B5B8543CB34C8AB29B72ECA9E19296,"  SPR_COMBO[es]La tendencia de “maquillaje sin maquillaje” sigue fuerte, pero con un giro: ahora no solo queremos lucir frescas, también estructuradas. Y para lograrlo sin 17 productos ni gastar una fortuna, entra en escena Rimmel London Sculpting Palette, una joya low cost con tres tonos que trabajan en sinergia: bronceador, iluminador y colorete, todo en un compacto que cabe en cualquier bolso y cuesta apenas 6 euros. ¿Lo mejor? No es una paleta cualquiera. Fue desarrollada junto a Kate Moss, quien aporta ese toque cool británico a una fórmula práctica y efectiva. La promesa de la paleta es clara: esculpir, iluminar y dar color al rostro con naturalidad. Pero en la práctica, también ofrece versatilidad total: El bronceador es de tono neutro, sin subtono naranja, ideal para contorno sutil o efecto sunkissed. El iluminador tiene destello fino, nada glitter, que aporta ese glow elegante estilo Hailey Bieber. El rubor es rosa-melocotón universal, favorecedor en todo tipo de pieles, que da ese toque de vitalidad instantánea. Además, su textura sedosa y modulable permite trabajar las capas sin dejar manchones ni exceso de polvo. Se difumina fácil con brocha, esponja o incluso con los dedos si estás fuera de casa. Rimmel no es nuevo en el juego, pero esta paleta lleva meses en los primeros puestos de ventas de Amazon y es protagonista de muchos tutoriales en TikTok y YouTube. ¿La razón? Hace el trabajo de tres productos de lujo en un solo gesto. Muchas influencers la comparan con: La Filmstar Bronze & Glow de Charlotte Tilbury (pero 40 euros más barata). El Dior Backstage Glow Face Palette, por su efecto de segunda piel. O incluso con Fenty Beauty, en cuanto a practicidad y pigmentación. Además, en un contexto donde buscamos optimizar rutinas y espacio (bye neceser gigante), una paleta todo en uno tiene un valor emocional: es eficiente, compacta y libre de complicaciones. Por 6 euros, la Rimmel Sculpting Palette ofrece calidad, practicidad y versatilidad. Perfecta para principiantes, minimalistas, chicas que viajan o quienes buscan un glow con poco esfuerzo. No sustituye a productos de gama alta en textura extrema o larga duración tipo red carpet, pero para el día a día y looks de oficina o citas, es más que suficiente. Además, es un recordatorio de que el buen maquillaje no tiene por qué costar una fortuna. Porque al final, el estilo es lo que haces con lo que tienes, no lo que cuesta. @mundistyle","SPR_COMBO[es]La tendencia de “maquillaje sin maquillaje” sigue fuerte, pero con un giro: ahora no solo queremos lucir frescas, también estructuradas.

mov_058A476C836C36EC4FB309836609132E,"  In honour of their charitable work with The King's Trust, the human-rights attorney and the beauty mogul sat down with Glamour's global editorial director Samantha Barry to discuss sisterhood, advocacy, and why showing up for women isn't a luxury, it's a legacy. The first time Amal Clooney met Charlotte Tilbury, the human rights lawyer was preparing for her wedding. Charlotte arrived at her front door heavily pregnant and wheeling five oversized suitcases of makeup. Amal blinked at the sheer theatricality of it. “Is all that for me?” she asked. For the renowned makeup artist, that was travelling light. By the time of the wedding, Charlotte was no longer just the makeup artist getting the bride ready—she was an invited guest. Their connection, built on shared energy and strong maternal figures, became the beginning of something much more enduring: a sisterhood rooted in purpose, ambition, love, and a healthy dose of honesty. They come from different worlds (although as Charlotte points out, both are Aquarius with Pisces mothers)—one a decorated human rights lawyer, the other a global beauty entrepreneur. Amal has led landmark cases for women who went on to be Nobel laureates – like Nadia Murad and Maria Ressa. She has defended political prisoners, helped free journalists across continents, and shaped justice systems from Myanmar to The Hague. As cofounder of the Clooney Foundation for Justice with her husband, actor and director, George Clooney, she has now created a global network that provides free legal representation to thousands of women and girls around the world and helped free dozens of journalists who have been imprisoned for their speech. Charlotte has built a bona fide beauty empire valued at over $1 billion, was the first makeup artist to receive an MBE—member of the Order of the British Empire, an honour awarded by the monarch for a particular achievement—and is a definitive staple in makeup bags for millions of people across the globe. I've known both women for years. Amal and I have been close friends since our single days in London, when I was working as a television producer for the BBC and Amal was already a phenomenal legal mind working as a barrister at law firm Doughty Street Chambers. I met Charlotte at Amal's wedding, where the sparkle on her eye shadow was rivalled only by her energy on the dance floor. Since then I've followed their work and their life paths. On a sunny June morning, I sit with both women in Amal's English country home to do more than just catch up—to discuss empowering initiatives that are dear to them both. Amal and Charlotte have just been at Buckingham Palace where they've used their friendship as a launchpad for real impact via their work with The King's Trust, a charitable organisation founded by King Charles III (then Prince Charles) in 1976. It was renamed from The Prince's Trust in 2024 and focuses on providing young people who are facing challenges with mentorship, funding, job training, and skill building. Both Amal and Charlotte have spent the last four years mentoring and uplifting young women from around the world—Kenya, Pakistan, India—many of whom are survivors of poverty, forced marriage, or systemic violence. The award created by the Trust in Amal's name honors one extraordinary young woman each year, while Charlotte hosts hands-on workshops to teach entrepreneurship and confidence. And then there are the Albie Awards, hosted by the Clooney Foundation for Justice—an annual event that shines a spotlight on the unsung heroes who are fighting for justice: journalists, advocates, and human rights defenders risking their lives for truth. Charlotte is not only a sponsor but truly committed to the vision. This fall the Albies will take place in London for the first time at the city's National History Museum. Amal's kitchen table, where we settled in to do our interview, still held the remains of breakfast. There were updates about children, requests for tea and Coca-Cola, and gentle teasing. Amal's husband, George, popped in and out—always charming, always supportive, joking about his rival photo shoot taking place in the garden. This is a friendship that glows with love and joy, but it's also girded by hard work, deep trust, and shared mission. There is fun , yes, but also courtroom advocacy, cross-continental mentorship, and real-time strategy over WhatsApp. It's women who understand that showing up for one another isn't a luxury, it's a legacy. Samantha Barry: Let's go back to that first meeting between you two. What do you both remember? Amal Clooney: When Charlotte showed up at my door with all those suitcases, I was aghast. I was like, “Are you going to need all of those products?” But I loved her energy and we got on so well. Charlotte Tilbury: I fell in love with Amal because she's such an inspiration. And I met her mother Baria, too; she's actually helped me when I had to go and do TV interviews. I think all the women in her family are actually very inspirational. I mean, Amal obviously is a major champion of empowerment of women around the world. You're an inspiration to all and to me. Amal: Well, can I just say I feel the same about you because I'm always so proud, because I think people meet Charlotte and they see this really attractive, bubbly, friendly, really down-to-earth person. And I'm always keen to point out, “By the way, she's one of the most successful female entrepreneurs to ever come out of the United Kingdom.” Amal, this weekend you talked about George in such a beautiful way. Can you share what he means to your work? Amal: I have a partner in life who is so supportive of what I do. So I don't feel like I have to apologize for it or rein it in. And I remember when I became a mom, which was obviously a new frontier, he was the first one to say, “I know you've got this speech at the Security Council. You have to go, I've got the kids, don't worry about it.”...","In honour of their charitable work with The King's Trust, the human-rights attorney and the beauty mogul sat down with Glamour's global editorial director Samantha Barry to discuss sisterhood, advocacy, and why showing up for women isn't a luxury, it's a legacy.

mov_BE3D06152050723F3304E0D4DC56772D,"  The first time Amal Clooney met Charlotte Tilbury, the human rights lawyer was preparing for her wedding. Charlotte arrived at her front door heavily pregnant and wheeling five oversized suitcases of makeup. Amal blinked at the sheer theatricality of it. “Is all that for me?” she asked. For the renowned makeup artist, that was traveling light. By the time of the wedding, Charlotte was no longer just the makeup artist getting the bride ready—she was an invited guest. Their connection, built on shared energy and strong maternal figures, became the beginning of something much more enduring: a sisterhood rooted in purpose, ambition, love, and a healthy dose of honesty. They come from different worlds (although as Charlotte points out, both are Aquarius with Pisces mothers)—one a decorated human rights lawyer, the other a global beauty entrepreneur. Amal has led landmark cases for women who went on to be Nobel laureates – like Nadia Murad and Maria Ressa. She has defended political prisoners, helped free journalists across continents, and shaped justice systems from Myanmar to The Hague. As cofounder of the Clooney Foundation for Justice with her husband, actor and director, George Clooney, she has now created a global network that provides free legal representation to thousands of women and girls around the world and helped free dozens of journalists who have been imprisoned for their speech. Charlotte has built a bona fide beauty empire valued at over $1 billion, was the first makeup artist to receive an MBE—member of the Order of the British Empire, an honor awarded by the monarch for a particular achievement—and is a definitive staple in makeup bags for millions of people across the globe. I've known both women for years. Amal and I have been close friends since our single days in London, when I was working as a television producer for the BBC and Amal was already a phenomenal legal mind working as a barrister at law firm Doughty Street Chambers. I met Charlotte at Amal's wedding, where the sparkle on her eye shadow was rivaled only by her energy on the dance floor. Since then I've followed their work and their life paths. On a sunny June morning, I sit with both women in Amal's English country home to do more than just catch up—to discuss empowering initiatives that are dear to them both. Amal and Charlotte have just been at Buckingham Palace where they've used their friendship as a launchpad for real impact via their work with The King's Trust, a charitable organization founded by King Charles III (then Prince Charles) in 1976. It was renamed from The Prince's Trust in 2024 and focuses on providing young people who are facing challenges with mentorship, funding, job training, and skill building. Both Amal and Charlotte have spent the last four years mentoring and uplifting young women from around the world—Kenya, Pakistan, India—many of whom are survivors of poverty, forced marriage, or systemic violence. The award created by the Trust in Amal's name honors one extraordinary young woman each year, while Charlotte hosts hands-on workshops to teach entrepreneurship and confidence. And then there are the Albie Awards, hosted by the Clooney Foundation for Justice—an annual event that shines a spotlight on the unsung heroes who are fighting for justice: journalists, advocates, and human rights defenders risking their lives for truth. Charlotte is not only a sponsor but truly committed to the vision. This fall the Albies will take place in London for the first time at the city's National History Museum. Amal's kitchen table, where we settled in to do our interview, still held the remains of breakfast. There were updates about children, requests for tea and Coca-Cola, and gentle teasing. Amal's husband, George, popped in and out—always charming, always supportive, joking about his rival photo shoot taking place in the garden. This is a friendship that glows with love and joy, but it's also girded by hard work, deep trust, and shared mission. There is fun , yes, but also courtroom advocacy, cross-continental mentorship, and real-time strategy over WhatsApp. It's women who understand that showing up for one another isn't a luxury, it's a legacy. Samantha Barry: Let's go back to that first meeting between you two. What do you both remember? Amal Clooney: When Charlotte showed up at my door with all those suitcases, I was aghast. I was like, “Are you going to need all of those products?” But I loved her energy and we got on so well. Charlotte Tilbury: I fell in love with Amal because she's such an inspiration. And I met her mother Baria, too; she's actually helped me when I had to go and do TV interviews. I think all the women in her family are actually very inspirational. I mean, Amal obviously is a major champion of empowerment of women around the world. You're an inspiration to all and to me. Amal: Well, can I just say I feel the same about you because I'm always so proud, because I think people meet Charlotte and they see this really attractive, bubbly, friendly, really down-to-earth person.

mov_1B81680A041E0E5587A74250C80C93CD,"  Their triumph at the 2022 Euros turned England's Lionesses from little-known footballers into national heroines. And if the tournament made them famous, it also transformed their lives off the pitch. From lucrative brand ambassadorships with high-end fashion labels such as Gucci to turns on the red carpet in dresses worthy of a Kardashian, England's female footballers now enjoy more than a touch of glitz and glamour. Once badly paid and barely recognised – who could forget goalie Mary Earps complaining before the last Euros that Nike hadn't even bothered to print replica shirts with her name on them – the nation's female footballers now have a soaring commercial appeal. So as they prepare to face France at 8pm tonight in their first game of this year's Euros – and inspire a new generation of young women with their sporting prowess – Molly Clayton reveals which of our Lionesses enjoys the most luxurious lifestyle. The Gucci model Shoots for Vogue, GQ and Elle Magazine. Modelling for Calvin Klein. Gucci snapping her up as a brand ambassador. Clearly, as well as being an impressive England captain, Leah Williamson, 28, has a catwalk-worthy fashion career too. One of the biggest earners off the pitch after leading the Lionesses to victory at the Euro 2022 final, the blonde beauty has a deal with Nike and has collaborated with global brands such as Aston Martin, Pepsi, Walkers and Mastercard. With 1.1 million Instagram followers, she has new advert partnerships with Weetabix and Cadbury, along with six children's books, titled The Wonder Team. With the deals comes the gloss: her recent lavish Mallorcan holiday to an Ikos resort would have set her back in the region of £1,000 a night. She is rumoured to be dating former model and Miss USA Elle Smith – both have posted about each other on social media. Ella the business brainbox With her ever-present fake eyelashes and love of make-up, Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone, 25, often showcases her beauty routine on her own YouTube channel. And with a canny business acumen to boot, Ella has already shaped an enviable off-pitch career. The first England women's player to trademark her name, she's set up her own brand, ET7, which includes a football academy for young girls. The name is inspired by her childhood hero, Portuguese footballing superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, whose own brand is called CR7. With some estimating her worth at more than £1 million, last month she set up her own creative agency, Amicizia, which aims to connect female athletes to commercial and marketing opportunities with top brands. Her sponsors include make-up company Charlotte Tilbury, orthodontic brand Invisalign and McDonald's, with her yearly earnings estimated as upwards of £200,000, fuelled by her popularity on social media. At one point, she was one of the top five most viewed athletes on TikTok. Ella has 737,000 Instagram followers and her own BBC podcast with best friend and fellow Lioness Alessia Russo, with whom she has appeared on the front cover of fashion and beauty magazine Elle. Ella loves nothing more than a red carpet bash. In a relationship with footballer Joe Bunney of Stalybridge Celtic FC, she regularly treats her fans to glimpses of their lavish holidays abroad and spa days at five-star hotels. Lauren's ooh la la lego Proving that every passion can be profitable, Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp, 24, has topped up her estimated £400,000 salary with a sponsorship deal with Lego. Devoted to creating Lego masterpieces in her downtime, saying it's 'the best way to relax', she's even made the Mona Lisa out of the bricks. Her other sponsors include Nike and Sports Direct. Lauren also has the support of her girlfriend, former Liverpool midfielder Ashley Hodson. Together for two years, the pair recently enjoyed a romantic trip to Paris, where Lauren saw the Mona Lisa in her more traditional setting. Shy superstar with an ex on the team Growing up, Lucy Bronze lived on Lindisfarne – also known as Holy Island – off the windswept coast of Northumberland. Her grandmother was caretaker of Lindisfarne Castle and today the outline of that building is tattooed on Lucy's wrist. Shy into adulthood, she was diagnosed with ADHD and autism in 2021. But neither her isolated upbringing nor her neurodiversity held her back. Rather, she's said she uses the intense focus associated with her conditions to her advantage – and now the 33-year-old is one of the biggest earners in the game. She reportedly took home £200,000 a year while playing at Barcelona before her move to Chelsea in 2024. Big money deals followed her triumph at the last Euros, with Pepsi, EE, Klarna and Visa among her backers. Her former girlfriend is fellow Lioness Keira Walsh. Fashion week regular She earned almost £2 million in 2023 alone, according to Forbes magazine. That same year, Alessia Russo's transfer from Manchester United to Arsenal made her one of the most expensive female footballers on the planet. Her contract is said to be worth more than £500,000 a year and her commercial appeal is just as lucrative. She has deals with Gucci, Adidas, PlayStation, Beats by Dr Dre and last month was gifted an MGS5 EV car, which she proudly showed off on Instagram. A regular at London Fashion Week, Alessia, 26, has appeared on the cover of magazines such as Women's Health. The BAFTA TV Awards in May saw her in a £1,295 Roland Mouret dress, right. Revealing outfits... on pitch too! Hair scraped back and with braces on her teeth, Chloe Kelly scored that late winning goal against Germany at Wembley in 2022, famously taking off her top in celebration.

A regular at London Fashion Week, Alessia, 26, has appeared on the cover of magazines such as Women's Health. The BAFTA TV Awards in May saw her in a £1,295 Roland Mouret dress, right. BURBERRY CLAD GOALIE BURBERRY HANNAH Hampton - the longhaired goalkeeper with the girl-next-door looks - certainly has big shoes to fill after Mary Earps surprisingly announced her retirement from the squad last month. The 24-year-old Chelsea player has posed in Burberry for Elle magazine and counts Nike and Extra chewing gum among her corporate sponsors. She also works with Birmingham Children's Hospital after enduring numerous eye operations as a child to cure a squint. Hannah was told she would never be a professional sports player. ' I've gone through life proving people wrong,' she said recently, words that inspired devotion among her 228,000 Instagram followers. Her relationship status isn't known. DUBAI DEVOTEE SHE never travels without her Louis Vuitton luggage, can often be seen posing in a Maybach car, and enjoys swanky trips to Dubai, staying at the luxury Five resort there. Chelsea star Lauren James, 23, has treated herself to some of the finer things in life since her key role in the Lionesses' 2023 World Cup campaign. While her relationship status isn't known, she's close to her older brother Reece, who plays for the Chelsea men's team. She has commercial deals with Nike, Google Pixel, Optimum Nutrition, Sure deodorant and Walkers. The superstar siblings often attend red carpet events together. But while she is reportedly on £350,000 a year at Chelsea, Reece earns £250,000 a week. KOOKY STYLE SO DEVOTED is she to tattoos that midfielder Georgia Stanway, 26, not only has around 100 of her own inkings, but she's also learned to tattoo other people. The Bayern Munich star's kooky style has won her sponsors including Nike and an advertising deal with Celsius drinks, who featured on her Instagram page, where she has 433,000 followers. Off the pitch, she's been with Toulouse rugby league player Olly Ashall-Bott since 2022....",2025-07-05 10:35:26,en,PRINT,,,,,1,False,False,"The provided text is an article about female footballers and their sponsorship deals, careers, and personal lives.

The A list actor hailed the show as the 'greatest' she'd ever seen. Other famous faces to watch the performance included former Doctor Who star Matt Smith, who was also at last night's gig, and makeup mogul Charlotte Tilbury. Danny Dyer, Holly Willoughby and Vernon Kay were some of the stars on show for last night's concert. When Sienna was asked by The Mirror what she thought of the concert, she joked: ""It was alright,"" before revealing she was there for both Cardiff gigs. ""It's the greatest show I've ever seen. The love and the nostalgia and the joy, it's like saving the world."" Matt Smith said the show was ""amazing"". Oasis returned for a second night at the Principality Stadium to perform another two hour show, with the 23 song setlist unchanged from last night. The set started with Hello, the first song on 1995's (What's the Story) Morning Glory, and again ended with Champagne Supernova. The Gallagher brothers again strode onto the stage, arm in arm, as they did on Friday night. Liam then bowed down before his brother, as seen on fan footage of the gig. Like the first night, Liam enjoyed some banter with the crowd. After Bring It On Down, he asked the crowd to 'do the Poznan', the celebration which Manchester City fans took from Polish side Lech Poznan, where supporters turn their back to the game and jump up and down, arm in arm. Noel also got involved. Before beginning Half The World Away, he joked: ""This is for the Royale Family!"" During the final bars of Whatever, Liam changed the words and sang a few lines from The Beatles' Octopus's Garden. During Don't Look Back in Anger, tributes were again paid to victims of the Manchester Arena attack, with images of bees appearing on the big screen. Ending with Champagne Supernova, the band played the same setlist as the opening show of the tour. The brothers from Burnage were again joined on stage by guitarist Paul 'Bonehead' Arthurs, who is back with both Gallaghers for the first time in 25 years after leaving the group in 1999. The founding members were joined by long-time members Andy Bell, previously of shoegaze icons Ride, and guitarist Gem Archer, who replaced Bonehead. Completing the line up is new drummer Joey Waronker, who recently performed on Liam Gallagher and John Squire's recent album. Touring members also include Christian Madden on keyboards, Jessica Greenfield on backing vocals, Alastair White on trombone, Steve Hamilton on saxophone and Joe Auckland on trumpet.

If you haven't gotten into retinoids yet or are worried about irritating your skin, this gentle but effective serum is a great option — and reviewers say they like it better than other more expensive options (like Murad's Retinol Serum, which retails for $92). And remember, like with any retinol (that actually works) *just do not use it every day. * Start slow and work yourself up if needed, paying attention to your skin.

Anfang Juni berichtete WWD, dass Coty erwägt, seine Verbraucher- und Prestige-Divisionen zu veräußern, darunter einige der bekanntesten Marken von Beauty wie Covergirl sowie Chloé- und Hugo-Chef-Parfums. Die Ankündigung versetzte den Aktienkurs von Coty 13 Prozent auf 5 USD; Die Veräußerung beider Waffen würde im Wesentlichen mehr als 120 Jahre als Unternehmen beendet. Coty lehnte es ab, sich zu dem Bericht zu äußern. Trotz seiner Größe und Stall bekannter Namen hat das amerikanische Konglomerat in den letzten Jahren Schwierigkeiten, mit seinen Konkurrenten Schritt zu halten. Innerhalb des Portfolios seines größten Anteilseigners Jab Holdings ist Coty das schlechteste Kapital und senkt den Ausblick im letzten Geschäftsjahr, wobei weitere Umsatzrückgänge projiziert werden. Coty hat versucht, sein Ansehen zu verbessern. Seit seinem derzeitigen CEO Sue Nabi im Jahr 2020 eintraf, hat das Unternehmen das Fett getrimmt und nicht-Kernmarken wie Professional Lines Wella und OPI abgebrochen. Aber es bleibt immer noch seine äußeren Kollegen wie L'Oréal und Elf Beauty zurück, und im Mai verkaufte es Skkn von Kim, der Prestige-Hautpflegemarke, an seinen Gründer zurück, den Multi-Hyphenate-Reality-Star Kim Kardashian und ihre Bekleidungsfirma Skims, nachdem die Marke versäumt hatte, mit Schaufenster für Furore zu machen. Die Kerngeschäfte, Duft- und Drogerie -Make -up, stehen ebenfalls unter Druck. Während der Duft die kategorische Kategorie der Branche ist und Coty einige der weltweit bekanntesten Düfte der Welt herstellt, ist der heftig wettbewerbsfähige Sektor mit neuen Herausforderern gefüllt. Die Bemühungen, das Summen wie trendige Körpermists für Calvin Klein und die Wiederbelebung von Marc Jacobs Beauty zu fördern, sind in einem von Nischenspieler und Tiktok -Viralität dominierten Markt ein Rückgang des Ozeans. Die Drogerie -Marken haben ebenfalls unterdurchschnittlich geschafft. “So ziemlich alles in der Messe hat nicht funktioniert … Ich gebe ihnen viel Anerkennung dafür, dass sie kreativ sind und Dinge ausprobieren”, sagte Lauren Lieberman, Geschäftsführer bei Barclays Consumer Practice, in der Bemühungen zur Wiederbelebung von Covergirl. Sie bemerkte auch die gedämpfte Wiederbelebung der Philosophie, die Hautpflege und die Bade- und Körperlinie, die ein großer Erfolg in den Aughts sowie die Sun Care Line Lancaster war. Mit dem Rücktritt von Jab Holdings 'langjähriger Vorsitzender Peter Harb im April wird neue Führung wahrscheinlich für ein neues Denken bereit sein. Wenn Coty versucht, Käufer von Gerichts zu nehmen, sind potenzielle Bieter schlank und würden wahrscheinlich in einige ausgewählte Kategorien fallen. bricht zusammen, wer interessiert sein könnte – und warum – unten. Die Kronjuwelen Prestige -Duft bleibt Cotys heißeste Eigenschaft. Es enthält langfristige Lizenzen für Chloé, Gucci, Hugo-Chef und Calvin Klein, einige der berühmtesten Modehäuser der Welt. Hugo -Chef wird als die größte Marke des Unternehmens angesehen, die rund 10 Prozent oder rund 585 Millionen US -Dollar in Höhe von rund 9 Prozent und 7 Prozent des Gesamtumsatzes des Unternehmens umfasst. Dies sind wünschenswerte Vermögenswerte, selbst mit intensiver Konkurrenz durch Inseln auf dem Weg. Diese Düfte des Modehaus sind weit verbreitet, bekannt und haben ein integriertes Prestige und Dynamik. Ein Spezialist für Duftlizenzspezialist wie Interphlum, das für Lacoste und Anna Sui Parfums herstellt, könnte theoretisch interessiert sein. Seit 2022 hat es DKNY wiederbelebt und die Linie neu anspricht, nachdem LVMH sie an die G-III-Gruppe, ein Modeportfoliounternehmen, abgeladen hatte. Das spanische Konglomerat Puig könnte auch ein Anwärter sein; Während es sein Vertrauen in die Lizenzierung verringert hat und sich stattdessen auf den Besitz von Marken verändert hat, nachdem sie Byredo und Charlotte Tilbury aufgenommen haben, verwaltet es geschickt ähnliche Modehaus-Duftmarken wie Carolina Herrera und Jean-Paul Gaultier und könnte dazu beitragen, dass die Marken frische Energie injizieren könnten.

Der Gucci-Besitzer Kering hat kein Geheimnis aus seinen lauwartigen Gefühlen gegenüber der Gucci-Schönheitsmarke unter Cotys Besitz, die 2028 abläuft, kein Geheimnis gemacht, und Kering hat jetzt eine interne Schönheitsabteilung mit Creed. LVMH, dem Marc Jacobs gehört, hat sich als Expertise in Beauty bewährt und Schönheitsangebote wie Dior und Guerlain verwaltet. „Die Tatsache, dass Coty gedauert hat [as a company] So lange ist, weil Duft ein so großartiges Geschäft ist “, sagte Lieberman. In jüngerer Zeit beginnen Unternehmen wie LVMH und KERING ihre eigenen Schönheitswaffen oder konsolidieren ihre Bemühungen auf andere Weise. Lieberman sagte, andere Firmen wie Puig oder Fashion Lizenzierhäuser könnten alle logische Bieter sein, aber das Reiben ist, dass Cotys Fähigkeit, diese Lizenzen zu verkaufen, nicht eindeutig ist. Abhängig von der Art der unterzeichneten ursprünglichen Vereinbarungen können sie möglicherweise das Eigentum an ein neues Unternehmen übertragen. Massenbeschwerde Cotys Sortiment an Massenmarken wie Rimmel und Covergirl hat eine Namenserkennung, aber das Wachstum hat stagniert, da sie Marktanteile an schneller bewegende Indies wie Elf Beauty und Kiko Milano abgeschlossen haben. Sally Hansen ist laut Nielsen-IQ-Daten die größte Massennagelmarke der USA mit einem Marktanteil von 38 Prozent, obwohl der Umsatz auch gesunken ist, da die Verbraucher länger anhaltende Behandlungen priorisieren. Während die Massenmarken von Coty oft unter den Top 10 rangieren, ist der Drogeriekanal in den USA insgesamt weniger lukrativ geworden, da die Auswahl der Marken und im Geschäftserfahrung nicht mit Amazon und zunehmend Tiktok-Shop konkurrieren. Es ist unwahrscheinlich, dass ein strategischer Käufer eine so durchdrungene Marke mit niedrigem Wachstumskaderraum übernehmen möchte, aber Private Equity könnte für die Herausforderung stehen, insbesondere wenn er internationale Möglichkeiten für die Marken sieht. Solche Carve-Outs sind nicht ungewöhnlich in der Schönheit, sondern konzentrieren sich häufig auf Prestige-Marken: Private Equity Firm Advent Creecting im Jahr 2022, um Bareminerals, Buxom und Laura Mercier von Shiseido zu kaufen, während Coty einige seiner professionellen Marken, einschließlich Wella Company, im Jahr 2020 zum Private Equity-Unternehmen KKR abfuhr.

The best journalism often comes from topics that writers are personally passionate about—an obsession they have, or a question they can't stop thinking about. That's what happened for my colleague Jessica Mathews and her new Fortune story about Diaspora Co. The 8-year-old startup now pulling in “mid-millions” per year sells high-quality spices sourced from 140 farms. Founder Sana Javeri Kadri started with turmeric, after noting its growing popularity in the U.S., and has expanded to black pepper, cardamom, spice blends, and more. Among foodies and those who care about high-quality ingredients, the brand is incredibly popular. Jessica reached out to Javeri Kadri because she wanted to know, essentially, why and how her spices taste so good. The founder told her that most spices are indigenous to South Asia, and taste different when grown there—even compared to the same seeds, extracted and planted elsewhere. Diaspora Co. was bootstrapped for five years, before Javeri Kadri raised a $1 million pre-seed round and then a 2024 $1.5 million seed round from a whopping 75 angel investors, from Meena Harris to the founder of Salt & Straw ice cream—a strategy that helped her set aside 35% of the company's equity for farmers and employees. “With the grocery venture capital world right now, you're often selling an unprofitable product at scale and hoping that it'll eventually become profitable,” she told Jessica. “I can't do that for my farm partners—that's a very short-term outlook. I want their kids to inherit their family business, and the family business to be thriving. I want our farmers to be happy,” she says. Read the full story here.

Like many, I take advantage of Amazon Prime Day sales to stock up on the everyday things I use most in life, like contact solution, makeup remover, cleaning products and more. However, it's also the perfect time to shop some of Amazon's best-kept secrets, including products that you just didn't know you could get on Amazon, like luxury beauty products, Away suitcases and even a trendy (yet still effective) hand sanitizer brand. Because I would never gatekeep, I've rounded up quite the assortment of HuffPost's secret top-sellers and clandestine staff faves that are currently majorly discounted for Prime Day. Keep reading and pick up one of these secretly must-have items and enjoy serious deals while they are still hot. Prices change quickly on Prime Day, so keep checking back to see the latest updates. Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. Touchland Power Mist hydrating hand sanitizer spray trio (30% off list price) Whether you're traveling this summer or simply moving through life, there are plenty of places that we frequent that can get pretty germy, making hand sanitizer a daily essential. The Touchland Power Mist Hydrating hand sanitizer is a great option that not only contains 70% alcohol to kill germs but is infused with nourishing skin care ingredients like aloe vera and lemon essential oil to keep your skin from drying out. L'Oréal Lumi Glotion (41% off list price) We've formally called L'Oreal's Lumi Glotion the perfect shortcut to perfect skin and one of the most convincing alternatives to the famed Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter. Available in five flexible shades, this tinted moisturizer is famous for offering sheer yet luminous coverage and promises to melt seamlessly into skin without setting into fine lines or appearing cakey. Wear it alone, under makeup or as a highlighter and enjoy the formula infusion of long-adored ingredients such as shea butter and glycerin, a humectant that draws moisture into the skin for all-day hydration. Medicube Zero Pore pads (52% off list price) Few items have impressed me as much as these cult-favorite toning facial pads. I've ditched my traditional AHA serums for these bad boys, and my skin has never looked better. The Medicube pads are designed to help exfoliate, balance and brighten skin while reducing oil production, minimizing breakouts and refining the look of pores. They are formulated with powerful alpha and beta hydroxy acids like white willow bark, vitamin C and calming botanical extracts like lavender to soothe skin. I've noticed that my skin is softer, smoother and has a really noticeable glow. Most importantly, I've detected a decrease in melasma, which has plagued me since my pregnancy. They're incredibly potent, and it's very obvious to me why they're so popular. I've tried out other exfoliating pads and can confidently say that these are just as, if not more, effective at a fraction of the price. They've been a game-changer for my skin in the last couple of months, and I just hope they don't sell out now that the secret's out! A multifunctional electric spin scrubber brush (38% off list price) There's a good chance you've spotted bathroom spin scrubber brushes on social media, but this is the first time we've eyed a multi-use brush that can be used everywhere from the bathroom to the kitchen (although for sanitary reasons, we recommend you grab two for separate use in those rooms), on dishes and beyond. It includes a kitchen spin scrubber, a small flat brush, a sisal brush, two scouring pad brushes, two sponge brushes, two descaling brushes and a velcro adaptor for pads. This little guy will leave no grime left behind! A wireless CarPlay adapter (50% off list price) With this one tiny gadget, you'll have the power to seamlessly connect your phone to your vehicle's CarPlay system so that every function you enjoy on your phone — calls, voice commands, maps, music and more — can be accessible without needing to manually plug in. This even extends to the physical controls on your steering wheel. Please note that this lightning-fast adapter is only compatible with iPhones 10 and above. A similar model is often popping up on TikTok, but this one is our special secret. It's especially good for anyone proudly pushing an older vehicle that doesn't have Bluetooth capabilities. Clinique Almost Lipstick tinted lip balm (30% off list price) Many beauty lovers know that this perfectly hued beauty product is the end-all be-all of lip balms. It's available in Black Honey and Pink Honey shades, though Black Honey is a cult-favorite lip color that's considered universally flattering and has been popular since the early aughts. This semi-glossy balm is perfect for everyday wear and many a beauty insider's secret weapon. I honestly can't believe it's available as an Amazon Prime Day deal! Away Bigger carry-on luggage (20% off list price) The Bigger carry-on is what put Away on the map. It fits an astonishing amount of clothing while still complying with carry-on regulations for most major airlines. It's a game-changer for people who never want to check a bag. Like all of Away's suitcases, it's made with durable, water-repellent and lightweight materials and 360-degree wheels that glide with ease. The adjustable trolley handle has two height settings, while the interior compression pad system and organizer makes it easy to load up on clothing. It also comes with a water-repellent laundry bag and is available in seven colors. Away bags only landed on Amazon a of couple of months ago, and no one was expecting them to be included during Prime Day sales. A pair of silky pajamas (28% off list price) Parsing through the myriad of clothing deals during Prime Day is a bit of a chore, and the really good stuff easily gets lost in the shuffle, like this lightweight set. It is soft, breathable and feels silky smooth against the skin....","You won't believe what you can nab on Prime Day if you know where to look.Don't miss out on these secretly fabulous items at Amazon during Prime Day sales.

Medicube Zero Pore pads (52% off list price) Few items have impressed me as much as these cult-favorite toning facial pads. I've ditched my traditional AHA serums for these bad boys, and my skin has never looked better. The Medicube pads are designed to help exfoliate, balance and brighten skin while reducing oil production, minimizing breakouts and refining the look of pores. They are formulated with powerful alpha and beta hydroxy acids like white willow bark, vitamin C and calming botanical extracts like lavender to soothe skin. I've noticed that my skin is softer, smoother and has a really noticeable glow. Most importantly, I've detected a decrease in melasma, which has plagued me since my pregnancy. They're incredibly potent, and it's very obvious to me why they're so popular. I've tried out other exfoliating pads and can confidently say that these are just as, if not more, effective at a fraction of the price. They've been a game-changer for my skin in the last couple of months, and I just hope they don't sell out now that the secret's out! A multifunctional electric spin scrubber brush (38% off list price) There's a good chance you've spotted bathroom spin scrubber brushes on social media, but this is the first time we've eyed a multi-use brush that can be used everywhere from the bathroom to the kitchen (although for sanitary reasons, we recommend you grab two for separate use in those rooms), on dishes and beyond. It includes a kitchen spin scrubber, a small flat brush, a sisal brush, two scouring pad brushes, two sponge brushes, two descaling brushes and a velcro adaptor for pads. This little guy will leave no grime left behind! A wireless CarPlay adapter (50% off list price) With this one tiny gadget, you'll have the power to seamlessly connect your phone to your vehicle's CarPlay system so that every function you enjoy on your phone — calls, voice commands, maps, music and more — can be accessible without needing to manually plug in. This even extends to the physical controls on your steering wheel. Please note that this lightning-fast adapter is only compatible with iPhones 10 and above. A similar model is often popping up on TikTok, but this one is our special secret. It's especially good for anyone proudly pushing an older vehicle that doesn't have Bluetooth capabilities. Clinique Almost Lipstick tinted lip balm (30% off list price) Many beauty lovers know that this perfectly hued beauty product is the end-all be-all of lip balms. It's available in Black Honey and Pink Honey shades, though Black Honey is a cult-favorite lip color that's considered universally flattering and has been popular since the early aughts. This semi-glossy balm is perfect for everyday wear and many a beauty insider's secret weapon. I honestly can't believe it's available as an Amazon Prime Day deal! Away Bigger carry-on luggage (20% off list price) The Bigger carry-on is what put Away on the map. It fits an astonishing amount of clothing while still complying with carry-on regulations for most major airlines. It's a game-changer for people who never want to check a bag. Like all of Away's suitcases, it's made with durable, water-repellent and lightweight materials and 360-degree wheels that glide with ease. The adjustable trolley handle has two height settings, while the interior compression pad system and organizer makes it easy to load up on clothing. It also comes with a water-repellent laundry bag and is available in seven colors. Away bags only landed on Amazon a of couple of months ago, and no one was expecting them to be included during Prime Day sales. A pair of silky pajamas (28% off list price) Parsing through the myriad of clothing deals during Prime Day is a bit of a chore, and the really good stuff easily gets lost in the shuffle, like this lightweight set. It is soft, breathable and feels silky smooth against the skin....",2025-07-08 12:00:17,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"While the content is primarily about Amazon Prime Day deals, it directly references Charlotte Tilbury by comparing the L'Oréal Lumi Glotion to the Charlotte Tilbury Hollywood Flawless Filter, which is a relevant makeup product comparison within the brand's category.",Medium,1.9247074127197266,False

After I get out of the shower when my hair is still damp I put some on my ends and work the rest up into the top of my head. Sometimes I blow my hair dry after I get out of the shower and put it on and then after I blow dry I put it on some more, and it looks absolutely beautiful — no greasy hair here. My hair type is fine and gets oily really fast and yet somehow this product tames it a bit and keeps it looking healthy for days!

Essence's Lash Princess mascara for 30% off because reviewers call it out as an excellent comparison for Too Faced's ""Better Than Sex"" and Benefit's ""They're Real."" TBH, you it's high time you try this ~holy grail~ mascara — it's cheap, gives you instant length, and delightfully sweatproof. What more can you ask for? Here's what BuzzFeeder Emma Lord has to say about it: Hello, that is my face above, because I bought into the hype of all the 5-star reviews and now I will never look back!! Putting it on is like giving my eyelashes butterfly wings. It doesn't get clumpy, it stays put ALL the livelong day no matter how much you sweat, and you can apply it on very lightly if you don't want it to look so dramatic, or continue applying for longer lashes each time. Promising review: ""AWESOME. I've always bought overpriced mascara. I'm very picky and hesitant, but I saw some reviews saying how awesome this was. I'll never go back to 'Better Than Sex' mascara because that's what I always use, and I compare it to that. This is the best mascara!!

Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. A Peripera Ink Velvet Lip Tint for up to 30% off — reviewers compare this to Charlotte Tilbury's $35 Pillow Talk and Nars' $22 Velvet Lip Glide, and love this this version for the softness of the matte color, how buildable and long-lasting it is, and how it doesn't crack or leave skin feeling dry. Promising review: ""I know you have seen this on TikTok and wondering if they are worth the hype. They are so just order them. I have so many colors from this brand, they are so easy to apply. Get them."" —Milly Price: $6.90 (originally $9.90; available in a variety of shades) 2. Mise En Scene Perfect Serum for 32% off, an extra STEAL considering this beloved K-beauty staple compares to the $46 Gisou version — reviews swear by this for for MEGA hair hydration and heat protection up to 450 degrees, so you can style your hair without sacrificing on shine. This unique blend of seven-oil blend Moroccan argan, olive, coconut, apricot, Marula, jojoba, and camellia oil not only protects hair, but helps correct damage from dryness, *and* reduces drying time. Check out a TikTok of the serum in action. Promising review: ""Literally, the best hair product you can possibly get that is affordable and doesn't leave your hair greasy — it makes it shiny and super soft. After I get out of the shower when my hair is still damp I put some on my ends and work the rest up into the top of my head. Sometimes I blow my hair dry after I get out of the shower and put it on and then after I blow dry I put it on some more, and it looks absolutely beautiful — no greasy hair here. My hair type is fine and gets oily really fast and yet somehow this product tames it a bit and keeps it looking healthy for days! Will purchase again and again!!!"" —Tara Klein Price: $12.94 (typically $18.99; available in two sizes, a mist style, and four other formulas) 3. Essence's Lash Princess mascara for 30% off because reviewers call it out as an excellent comparison for Too Faced's ""Better Than Sex"" and Benefit's ""They're Real."" TBH, you it's high time you try this ~holy grail~ mascara — it's cheap, gives you instant length, and delightfully sweatproof. What more can you ask for? Here's what BuzzFeeder Emma Lord has to say about it: Hello, that is my face above, because I bought into the hype of all the 5-star reviews and now I will never look back!! Putting it on is like giving my eyelashes butterfly wings. It doesn't get clumpy, it stays put ALL the livelong day no matter how much you sweat, and you can apply it on very lightly if you don't want it to look so dramatic, or continue applying for longer lashes each time. Promising review: ""AWESOME. I've always bought overpriced mascara. I'm very picky and hesitant, but I saw some reviews saying how awesome this was. I'll never go back to 'Better Than Sex' mascara because that's what I always use, and I compare it to that. This is the best mascara!! I'll never go back."" —patrick hauk Price: $10.48 for three (originally $14.97) 4. A pair of waterproof wireless earbuds for 32% off with some real AirPods Pro energy — except these feature a charging case that, bless its technologically savvy heart, has an LED display letting you know exactly how much charge is left. Reviewers also love how delightfully comfortable and sweatproof these are, making them a solid, affordable option for talking on the phone and exercising. Promising review: ""I use these every day at work! Love these — easy to learn and to use. Best thing about them? Well, everything, lol. Good sound, they hold a charge for long periods, and I don't have to worry about them losing power....",2025-07-08 19:17:42,en,WEB,,,✨,,1,False,True,"While the content does not directly discuss Charlotte Tilbury products, it mentions a comparison between a lip tint and Charlotte Tilbury's Pillow Talk product, which creates a meaningful connection to the brand in the context of makeup and lip products.",Medium,1.8535635471343994,False

The formula is silicone-free and vegan friendly and it's easy to use - apply shampoo to wet hair, lather and massage into the scalp, rinse thoroughly. For conditioning, apply the thickening conditioner to the hair, leave in for a few minutes, then rinse out. Shoppers have reported 'noticeable' results, with many asserting their hair is fuller, thicker and easier to manage. One said: ""I've been suffering from hair loss for the last three years, to the point where I was considering buying a wig...my hair is 75% thinner than it was several years ago.

Being able to get it in the larger packs is great because it saved a little bit of money."" ""This is the best my hair has felt in years.

Another, however, said he wouldn't recommend purchasing it and explained: ""Whilst this creates some volume it leaves the hair very coarse and straw-like in texture, which had led to breakage when brushing.

Bookmark Share Jada JonesContent Commercialisation Editor Bookmark Lovehoney's 'life-changing' Womanizer sex toys are up to 40% off in Amazon Prime sale (Image: Frank and Helena via ) Amazon customers are rushing to secure bargains on a selection of pleasure products as Lovehoney cuts prices on its best-selling items. One of the sexual wellness company's most celebrated innovations, Pleasure Air Technology, has witnessed significant price reductions across multiple products. Pleasure Air Technology is renowned for creating a 'sucking' sensation - and has garnered outstanding feedback. The most affordable piece in the range is the Womanizer Starlet, which typically retails for €49 but has had 35% slashed off, bringing it down to €31.85. As it's the most wallet-friendly choice, it features just four intensity levels, yet delighted customers are still declaring it transformative.

For those willing to invest slightly more, the Womanizer Pro40 has remained a longstanding favourite amongst Lovehoney team members. It's been reduced to €79.20 from €99, with the enhanced version offering six intensity modes, reports the Irish Mirror. It comes as no shock that there are thousands of stellar reviews, with purchasers declaring: ""Best orgasms I've had by far without another human involved. It's hard to tell exactly what it's doing and why it feels amazing - which is a bit weird at first, but I got over it quickly."" Lovehoney Prime Sale LINKBY The sexual wellness brand has launched a massive range of discounts for Prime Week up to 40% off Amazon The Womanizer Next 3D, boasting depth control for the suction sensation, has also seen a price drop, with a 20% discount reducing it to €167.

Lelo offers similar toys in their collection, such as the Sona 2 and Dot, which are presently discounted in LookFantastic's latest sale.

Bookmark Share Jada JonesContent Commercialisation Editor Bookmark Lovehoney's 'life-changing' Womanizer sex toys are up to 40% off in Amazon Prime sale (Image: Frank and Helena via ) Amazon customers are rushing to secure bargains on a selection of pleasure products as Lovehoney cuts prices on its best-selling items. One of the sexual wellness company's most celebrated innovations, Pleasure Air Technology, has witnessed significant price reductions across multiple products. Pleasure Air Technology is renowned for creating a 'sucking' sensation - and has garnered outstanding feedback. The most affordable piece in the range is the Womanizer Starlet, which typically retails for €49 but has had 35% slashed off, bringing it down to €31.85. As it's the most wallet-friendly choice, it features just four intensity levels, yet delighted customers are still declaring it transformative.

I am in my 50s, and a friend recommended the Womanizer. It's not just another vibrator - it's a whole different level of experience."" For those willing to invest slightly more, the Womanizer Pro40 has remained a longstanding favourite amongst Lovehoney team members. It's been reduced to €79.20 from €99, with the enhanced version offering six intensity modes, reports the Irish Mirror. It comes as no shock that there are thousands of stellar reviews, with purchasers declaring: ""Best orgasms I've had by far without another human involved. It's hard to tell exactly what it's doing and why it feels amazing - which is a bit weird at first, but I got over it quickly."" Lovehoney Prime Sale LINKBY The sexual wellness brand has launched a massive range of discounts for Prime Week up to 40% off Amazon The Womanizer Next 3D, boasting depth control for the suction sensation, has also seen a price drop, with a 20% discount reducing it to €167. Despite the Womanizer range's immense popularity, customers note that they do require a two-handed operation, leading some adventure seekers to favour alternatives like the Lovehoney Jessica Rabbit Vibrator, now reduced by 30% to €27.99, or the We-Vibe Tango X Bullet, currently priced at €71.20. Lelo offers similar toys in their collection, such as the Sona 2 and Dot, which are presently discounted in LookFantastic's latest sale.

The sale started at midnight on Tuesday, July 8 - but despite its name, shoppers don't just have one day to get their hands on the bargains. It will run all the way until midnight on Friday, July 11, with four whole days to shop the sale. You will need to have an Amazon Prime subscription in order to access the vast majority of the exclusive Prime Day deals. But while a membership usually costs £8.99 per month, Amazon is currently offering shoppers the opportunity to try a 30-day free trial to unlock Prime Day without having to pay a penny. Shoppers who have flocked to previous Prime Day sales will know that deals span a huge range of categories, from high-end tech gadgets to everyday household essentials. Amazon's own devices are virtually guaranteed to feature, with price drops on the likes of Fire TVs and TV Sticks, Echo smart speakers, Kindle and Ring devices. Other big-name brands often pop up in Prime Day events, offering some major savings for shoppers. But whether you're after the latest Ninja air fryer, a new Dyson or Shark vacuum cleaner, or a new Apple or Samsung phone, it's always worth shopping around to check offers from other websites, including the brand's own, to ensure you are snagging the best deal. In addition, price tracking websites should be every shopper's best friend when browsing the Prime Day sale this year. Sites such as camelcamelcamel can show the full price history of any Amazon product you have your eye on to see whether its sale price is all it's cracked up to be, while the likes of PriceRunner and PriceSpy can compare it against offers from other retailers.

Um, OK, I'm sure it's lovely, but let's take a moment here, shall we? Are you completely sure you need to coordinate your beach jellies with your candy-striped shorts and cropped top? Look, I'm going to come out and ask the question here. Have our holiday wardrobes got a bit … overexcited? I don't want to be a killjoy. But there is a fine line between a cheerful holiday aesthetic and looking as though you bought the entire contents of your suitcase while on a sangria-fuelled shopping spree at Gatwick. Beguiling though all this stuff is, there is a point where tomato-print sundresses and sandals with ric-rac lacing stop looking delightfully Dolce, and start looking a tiny bit overwrought. Take a deep breath and put those fringed palazzo pants down. Think loose trousers or shorts, T-shirts or linen shirts, boat shoes or Birkenstocks. No perky sundresses or bedazzling sandals The holiday wardrobe is now as relentlessly marketed in summer as baubles at Christmas and roses on Valentine's Day. The powers that be have figured out that “holiday” is a magic word when it comes to unlocking our purse strings. You can be sensible the rest of the year, but holidays are all about the treats, right? Yes, you absolutely do deserve a treat. I'm on your side here, believe me. It is precisely because I am an absolute sucker for the chic Provençal promise of yet another straw basket that I am getting a bit fed up with how much the holiday glamour industrial complex takes out of my salary. So I'm trying to take the rosé-tinted sunglasses off and remember that living my best life is not actually the same thing as bankrupting myself on loads of gaudy tat. Also, the style tide is turning. I've been to a few fashion shows in the south of France and Italy in the past few months (I know, hard life), which provide excellent opportunities for close study of what fashiony people wear when it's hot. And while long, dramatic dresses and slick tailoring are still pulled out of the bag for fancy evenings, the daytime and travelling looks are distinctly low-key. Think loose trousers or shorts, T-shirts or linen shirts, boat shoes or Birkenstocks. No perky sundresses, no bright co-ords, no bedazzling sandals. The name for this deliberately low-key look? Bore-core. But here's the thing. In the sea of sunny pastels and jaunty polka dots that is the airside Pret queue, it is the traveller in sleek, muted neutrals who stands out. Of course, it has to be done well to work. Good quality fabric is key – but investing in quality linen or Supima cotton makes sense when the pieces you are buying will unpack straight from your holiday suitcase to your home wardrobe. To build this look, start with separates. You want soft tailoring, not athleisure. Look for shorts and trousers with belt loops – a belt adds sophistication without looking fussy – sleek tank tops as a bottom layer, and breezy collared shirts that can be buttoned up smartly or worn open as a beach cover-up. Keep everything in neutrals, but within that, tonal shades are good – not too matchy-matchy. But we still want to feel special, right? As soon as M&S online was back, I snapped up their gold flat sandals (£29.50), which have a comfy adjustable slingback.

COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence would usually cost £23.99 for a 100ml bottle, but has had more than 50% knocked off it in a Prime Day Deal, bringing it down to £11.50. It uses real snail essence, which has been obtained in a safe and environmentally friendly way. This essence is said to repair and rejuvenate the skin from dryness and ageing. It is lightweight and boasts quick absorption. While it is 100% natural, hypoallergenic and dermatologist tested some skincare buffs are squeamish at the thought of a snail based product.

Learn more Amazon Prime members are snapping up impressive deals with the launch of this year's Amazon Prime Day sale, and skincare lovers are no exception. COSRX Advanced Snail 96 Mucin Power Essence would usually cost £23.99 for a 100ml bottle, but has had more than 50% knocked off it in a Prime Day Deal, bringing it down to £11.50. It uses real snail essence, which has been obtained in a safe and environmentally friendly way. This essence is said to repair and rejuvenate the skin from dryness and ageing. It is lightweight and boasts quick absorption. While it is 100% natural, hypoallergenic and dermatologist tested some skincare buffs are squeamish at the thought of a snail based product. For those we would recommend the Hyaluronic Fix Extreme4 2% Hydration Hydration Concentrate from Nip+Fab that has been reduced to £20.26 on Sephora or Curél's Anti-Wrinkle Hydrating Serum which is a third off at Boots now bringing it to £16.66.

With an adjustable strap I can wear it in multiple ways and the medium-sized handbag has a slim, stylish design that complements any outfit. Despite its relaxed look and unobtrusive size, this bag would give the Tardis a run for its money when it comes to storage space. It boasts three zippered exterior pockets for easy access to frequently used items, while the main compartment is cleverly divided in the middle, keeping all other essentials organized and eliminating the hassle of rummaging around. Inside, there are four more pockets, one zippered and three drop pockets to neatly store smaller items.

mov_CACDE98A79A4563DBE8CBB8A28993C99,"  You already know that Martha Stewart makes magic in the kitchen, but if you've seen her ""unfiltered"" selfies on Instagram, you might suspect she's up to some sort of wizardry to keep her aging skin looking dewy and moisturized. In the past, the 83-year-old has revealed some of the professional treatments she's received, the at-home face mask she swears by and the tinted sunscreen she relies on. Her skin-care routine isn't exactly cheap, but one affordable product she uses before applying makeup is L'Oreal True Match Lumi Glotion. According to Martha herself, this top-seller helps give her a glowing complexion — and right now it's $11, from $17, for none other than Prime Day. Related: The best moisturizers for aging skin Amazon This multitasker will help give you a lit-from-within look, no matter the time of year. Choose from five shades (prices vary slightly). $11 at Amazon Why is this a good deal? This popular ""glotion"" regularly retails for $17, which is plenty affordable already, especially if you compare it to high-end brands. However, you can save yourself six bucks right now and achieve similar results as the domestic diva — win-win! Why do I need this? On her website, Martha revealed the 14 beauty products she ""swears by,"" and this glow-enhancing priming lotion is near the top of the list. Her trusted makeup artist of many years, Daisy Toye, said she applies it to Martha's face after SPF to add dewiness and create ""a smooth canvas for makeup."" Infused with glycerin and shea butter, the lotion aims to hydrate and moisturize skin while enhancing its natural glow. The multitasker can be worn on its own for a natural look or as a primer under foundation if you prefer more coverage. You can also use it to contour your face by applying it to specific areas. It's available in five shades and can be used on your body too. What reviewers say Martha's not the only one who adores this glowy product — over 34,000 Amazon shoppers have given it their five-star seal of approval. Pros ""I've been using this product for seven months, and I've been complimented almost weekly about how I get my skin to look so dewy and glowy,"" raved one longtime fan. ""I use this all over with a good coverage foundation, and I've never felt/looked so sun-kissed. Such an amazing product for a killer price!"" ""I'm 70 and each time I've worn it, someone has said I looked 'good' or one time I looked 'fresh,'"" shared a content customer. ""This cream adds a subtle shine to your skin.

Amazon Illuminating, priming and affordable: Getting Martha Stewart's glow is as easy as adding this little wonder to your cart....","You already know that Martha Stewart makes magic in the kitchen, but if you've seen her ""unfiltered"" selfies on Instagram, you might suspect she's up to some sort of wizardry to keep her aging skin looking dewy and moisturized. In the past, the 83-year-old has revealed some of the professional treatments she's received, the at-home face mask she swears by and the tinted sunscreen she relies on. Her skin-care routine isn't exactly cheap, but one affordable product she uses before applying makeup is L'Oreal True Match Lumi Glotion. According to Martha herself, this top-seller helps give her a glowing complexion — and right now it's $11, from $17, for none other than Prime Day. Related: The best moisturizers for aging skin Amazon This multitasker will help give you a lit-from-within look, no matter the time of year. Choose from five shades (prices vary slightly). $11 at Amazon Why is this a good deal? This popular ""glotion"" regularly retails for $17, which is plenty affordable already, especially if you compare it to high-end brands. However, you can save yourself six bucks right now and achieve similar results as the domestic diva — win-win! Why do I need this? On her website, Martha revealed the 14 beauty products she ""swears by,"" and this glow-enhancing priming lotion is near the top of the list. Her trusted makeup artist of many years, Daisy Toye, said she applies it to Martha's face after SPF to add dewiness and create ""a smooth canvas for makeup."" Infused with glycerin and shea butter, the lotion aims to hydrate and moisturize skin while enhancing its natural glow. The multitasker can be worn on its own for a natural look or as a primer under foundation if you prefer more coverage. You can also use it to contour your face by applying it to specific areas. It's available in five shades and can be used on your body too. What reviewers say Martha's not the only one who adores this glowy product — over 34,000 Amazon shoppers have given it their five-star seal of approval. Pros ""I've been using this product for seven months, and I've been complimented almost weekly about how I get my skin to look so dewy and glowy,"" raved one longtime fan. ""I use this all over with a good coverage foundation, and I've never felt/looked so sun-kissed. Such an amazing product for a killer price!""

mov_7DAF10F59CA636211BDB3E8215F35F56,"  PARIS – Puig is celebrating its more than 110 years of existence with a new book, called “Puig, Home of Creativity.” The 148-page tome published by Rizzoli will be sold in select bookstores starting Sept. 2. It focuses on the legacy, values and brands that comprise the company founded by the Puig family, as well as a snapshot of the group's present and future. “In the last few years we have been forced to talk more about Puig than just the brands that we have under our umbrella,” explained Marc Puig, chairman and chief executive officer of the company. That was particularly true since the group went public in May 2024. “When the 110-year anniversary arrived, we felt that many of the stories and things that had happened over the last decade were worth putting in black and white,” he said, adding this was important for the world — as well as company employees — to see. “It's a good reflection of the essence of who we are,” the executive said. “Puig, Home of Creativity” was fashioned to reflect the company's spirit. It is also meant to complement the book Puig published to mark its centenary, called “Puig, 100 Years of a Family Business.” “The 100-year anniversary was an homage to the second generation,” said Puig. At the time, three of the four of the family members who made that up were still alive. But by today, all of them have passed away. “This book is more a legacy for the next generation, because now we're transitioning, from the family point of view, from the third to the fourth generation,” said Puig. “This book is a platform of where we are going.” The company — with fashion and beauty brands including Rabanne, Carolina Herrera, Dries Van Noten and Jean Paul Gaultier — has been developing strongly. Last year Puig's sales were 4.79 billion euros. Its products are sold in over 150 countries. More in Business Puig has grown its worldwide market share of fragrances from 3 percent to more than 10 percent. “We have been able to, over time, propose ideas that broke the molds,” said Puig, explaining that has been in terms of products and storytelling. “We create the environment for people to be able to grow and take risks. “'Home of Creativity' was a good way to express we are a home, because Puig's culture is based on a family's culture that has [infused] through the organization, where you try to take care of people,” said Puig. “But at the same time, you push the limits, and you try to excel at what you do. It's [also] 'creativity,' because we like to think that we are willing to take risks.” The company's choices over the years that have shaped it into what Puig is today — be it the focus on fragrance or niche brands or own brands — are highlighted in the new book. It opens with a photographic look of Barcelona, home to Puig since its conception, and traces the group's evolution until today, when the company is a premium beauty and fashion powerhouse with fragrance, makeup and skin care. There's a dive into the Puig family's history, the company's values and creative partnerships, as well as the thinking behind its brands. This is sprung to life with contributions from the likes of perfume historian Michael Edwards and perfumer Jean-Claude Ellena, images from the archives and newly commissioned photographs. Fourteen of the brands are highlighted, including Rabanne and its iconic metallic chain-mail dress, plus interviews with Charlotte Tilbury, Jean Paul Gaultier and Dries Van Noten, who talks about how his garden has influenced his creative world. A section describes Wes Gordon's succeeding Herrera at her eponymous brand. There is also a spotlight on Uriage's history, among other notable brand moments. Edwards penned a section about the rise of niche fragrances, which are important strategically for Puig, which has brands such as Penhaligon's, L'Artisan Parfumeur and Byredo. Puig's globetrotting is highlighted, as is its product development. With a deep sailing history, a major moment came last year, with the first Puig Women's America's Cup. Puig, on the behalf of his family, asked Ellena to create four colognes in memory of Antonio Puig, who founded the house. “Historically, we had some products that had the Puig family name that we were very proud of and over time they have been disappearing,” said Puig. “We wanted to make an homage to the name and to some of the inspirations for those products that at some point really shaped who we were as a company.” The exercise made the family proud, according to Puig. “There's always the question that you have to ask yourself: What makes that brand or company's personality, its value system? What's the essence that differentiates that company?” said Puig. “What are the characteristics of this company that the family has shaped that we want to maintain?” Change is of the essence. If one stays still, they fall — like in bicycle riding, he said. “But you also have to decide what it is that we want to keep evolving and changing, so that this company can survive and excel going forward,” added Puig. “Creating this book is a long and ambitious process,” said Catherine Bonifassi, editorial director of Rizzoli New York, in a statement. “During this journey, as an editor, you truly get to see the personality of the people you work with, as you are facing together challenges, surprises, creative decisions…, exchanges that reveal the real values of a brand and its people's creativity, openness, commitment and boldness.” “Puig, Home of Creativity” can be pre-ordered on rizzoliusa.com.","PARIS – Puig is celebrating its more than 110 years of existence with a new book, called “Puig, Home of Creativity.” The 148-page tome published by Rizzoli will be sold in select bookstores starting Sept. 2.

Der Appliktor ist extra gebogen, so dass er mühelos über die Lippen gleitet. Verpackung/Design: Das Lippenöl ist einer rosafarbenen Schachtel verpackt.

Anwendung: Durch den gebogenen Applikator lässt sich das Lippenöl viel besser auf meinen Lippen auftragen und verteilen! Ergebnis: Das Lippenöl hat nur einen sehr leichten rötlichen Farbton, aber es sorgt für einen schönen Glanz. Und meine Lippen wirken auch voller!

17849798922503248,"  ✨ Charlotte Tilbury – Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oil ✨ Farbe: Juicylicious Candy Fig Ich bin absolut begeistert von diesem Lippenöl! 💖 Es kombiniert Pflege, Farbe und Glanz in einem Produkt – perfekt für den Alltag, aber auch für besondere Anlässe. 🌿 Textur: Die Textur ist federleicht, seidig und überhaupt nicht klebrig. Es fühlt sich angenehm auf den Lippen an, ohne zu verlaufen oder sich schwer anzufühlen. Nach dem Auftragen sind die Lippen geschmeidig, glatt und tief mit Feuchtigkeit versorgt – kein Trockenheitsgefühl mehr! 💧 Wirkung: Die pflegende Wirkung ist sofort spürbar. Selbst spröde oder rissige Lippen wirken schon nach kurzer Zeit regeneriert und gesund. Der leichte Glanz verleiht einen frischen, jugendlichen Look. Besonders toll: Der Glanz bleibt lange sichtbar, ohne dass man ständig nachlegen muss. 🍓 Duft: Der Duft ist angenehm dezent – leicht fruchtig, süßlich und sehr feminin. Nicht künstlich oder aufdringlich, sondern genau richtig, um das Pflegeerlebnis abzurunden. 💄 Farbe: Die Nuance „Juicylicious Candy Fig“ ist ein warmer, natürlicher Ton, der den Lippen eine zarte Farbe verleiht. Sie passt zu jedem Hautton und ist sowohl solo als auch über Lippenstift wunderschön. Die Lippen wirken voller, definierter und glänzend – ganz ohne Aufwand! 👜 Verpackung: Das Design ist hochwertig, handlich und elegant – typisch Charlotte Tilbury. Der Applikator ist präzise und ermöglicht ein gleichmäßiges Auftragen ohne Kleckern. Ideal für unterwegs oder für das schnelle Auffrischen zwischendurch. 🌱 Inhaltsstoffe: Ich schätze besonders, dass das Produkt mit pflegenden Ölen und feuchtigkeitsspendenden Inhaltsstoffen formuliert ist. Meine Lippen fühlen sich genährt und geschützt an – sogar bei kaltem Wetter. 📸 Ich habe es pur getragen und auch über Lippenstift – beide Varianten sehen traumhaft aus! Fazit: Ein absolutes Must-Have für glänzende, gepflegte Lippen – stilvoll, wirksam und angenehm in der Anwendung. Ich werde es definitiv nachkaufen! 💋 influenster charlottetilbury #complimentary #unreallipoil #charlottetilbury","Charlotte Tilbury – Unreal Lips Healthy Glow Nectar Oil Farbe: Juicylicious Candy Fig Ich bin absolut begeistert von diesem Lippenöl!
