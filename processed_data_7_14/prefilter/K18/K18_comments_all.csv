n0t29qm,"  lots of other folks have mentioned that the example picture is dimensional vs all over color. like others have said, it would be better to use a 20 vol developer with the lightener powder for a longer period of time, instead of using 30 volume for a shorter period of time. if you got to the strand test color in 30 mins with 30 volume, you can definitely achieve it with a longer processing time using 20 volume and you'd be less likely to cause major damage. you can process for up to an hour, so just keep checking the color while the lightener processes. my recommendation would be to lighten your entire head in sections like you said you plan to, to get to a base color similar to what your strand test looks like. if you can wait a couple days and do some deep conditioning treatments after you have your base color, that would be best. i'd then go back in with a technique like this to achieve something similar to the highlights shown in your goal picture — she's obviously using a different tone of color here, but the takeaway of the video should be the lightener application techniques: https://youtu.be/gegncnXXxi0 pay attention to the volumes she is using — DO NOT go back in to highlight your base with 30 volume developer, your highlights will fry. you must use a 10 volume developer and give it time to process. she also has a lot of other great videos about doing highlights if you wanna browse her channel — again, don't focus on the color/toner shades she's using, just the bleach application techniques to help achieve the dimensional look in your example. imo, if you are okay with your base color matching your swatch, you'd be better off leaving it at that and then adding the highlights with a volume 10 developer, versus trying to lighten your whole head again. your hair would be much better off that way, versus trying to push it with another whole head application of lightener! you'd be very close to the example photo anyway after toning. sally's ion line has an olaplex dupe that you should definitely pick up. it's under $15 and one set would probably get you through 2-3 processes, so you might wanna pick up 2 boxes if your hair is thick, because it would be better to to have a little extra for next time vs. running out. here's the link, they have it in stores too: https://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-color/other-products-and-applications/fillers-and-additives/absolute-perfection-dual-kit/SBS-405019.html i'd also buy some k18 and apply it before/after processes: cheapest option here that i have been able to squeeze 2-3 applications out of in the past, but you'd be better off investing in the $30 pump bottle that's available on amazon: https://www.target.com/p/k18-leave-in-molecular-repair-hair-mask-0-17-oz/-/A-85972091 and then use a bond repairing shampoo and conditioner to help rebuild your hair integrity after all these processes. redken's bond repair line is pretty good and relatively affordable! pick up a nice serum too to keep the mids/ends healthy. if you can't invest in these products, i promise your hair would look better at whatever color it is now than lighter and unhealthy! but i think if you invest in the bond builder from sally's, k18, and a bond repairing shampoo and conditioner, your goal example is within reach. also not sure what your current base color is like or if you've done a whole head lightening process before, but make sure you understand how to apply the lightener for a whole head application so you don't end up with an uneven base color before you go back in to highlight. if you don't apply the lightener correctly you will end up with really uneven color — lighter roots from the heat of your head accelerating the bleach, etc. here is a good video that explains how to approach whole head lightening — as with the other example video, don't focus on the end result color, just pay attention to the techniques used to achieve an even color. adjust the processing times according to your goal base color: https://youtu.be/tYg3ZmbX5iw?si=mXSeHVLH6rBVWubP saw that you don't have sally's in your country. there are other products similar to olaplex; see if you can find ALL hd PLEX or LIW ph plex!

It's definitely healthy in my opinion and I have used lots of k18 and redken acidic bonding etc. I decided I was done with black and got two color removers (color zap) and my hair lifted a lot actually! I would say it's more of an auburn color now, not super orange or red, kind of orangey brown 6/7 level. No black is left. I planned to do it all myself but got too scared and decided to book a consultation at a rlly good hair salon I like. However I am so nervous to go because my hair looks so fucking ridiculous. I'm afraid to scare my stylist, I know how difficult it is to remove black but I'm hoping to just get to brunette.

1lr092w,"  I've been getting my hair bleached for about two years now and in the last six months or so I've noticed the hair around my hairline has become much thinner and shorter (I keep telling myself they're just baby hairs, but now I'm fearing the worst), and also the hair near my crown at the back of my head is vastly shorter than the rest of my hair. I've recently started using a hair serum and K18, and I managed to pick up some topical minoxidil at the airport the other day which I might have to resort to if all else fails. I also take the contraceptive pill and have for years if that's relevant. I'm naturally a dark blonde but have got so used to the bleached look that I'm scared to go back 😅 I've kind of accepted I might have to start wearing extensions soon if this continues, but I fear that will only make it worse in the long term. Shall I continue trying to make the dyed hair work with the serum and see if the topical minoxidil helps at all? Or shall I just ditch the bleach altogether?

n1872a7,"  Hi, pro here. The ingredients are not the same. If you put a bit of store bought shampoo in your palm can you turn it upside down? It boils down to the ph balance on what makes hair products professional or not truly. I am not personally a fan of sulfate free products. I like the active cleaning agents/bubbles. However; I will say Pantene is the worst for your hair. It has wax in it. You can literally wax your floors with it. Long term use causes a waxy build up that I've personally cut off of peoples hair shaft. It's awful and can cause much bigger issues. I can wash someone's hair and tell if they use it (often). K18 and Olaplex can be good. However, too much protein can cause breakage and frizz, you don't need it that often unless it's very damaged. Using professional products correctly is the key. Some people aren't educated in the type of hair they have and actual products or frequency of use. I should also mention, there's a lot of fakes and expired products sold with really good packaging. Unless it's sold in a professional salon (not Amazon or a grocery store) there isn't a guarantee you're actually getting the correct product.

tw_sl_44c8eb782272906f590d113f82a2fdf9,"  Keeping your hair soft and smooth can be a real challenge, particularly if you're a fan of getting it bleached like I am. Each time I visit the hairdressers for my usual scalp bleach, I make sure I use all the top nourishing products to keep my hair in tact, such as K18 and Wella. It's safe to say that investing in haircare products isn't cheap, but I was so glad that I stumbled across this small but mighty hair mask. The Wella Professionals Care Ultimate Repair Overnight Serum is priced at £20, and is designed to be left on overnight, but sometimes I like to put it on in the morning and let my hair air dry too. On the LOOKFANTASTIC website, the full product description reads: ""The Wella Professionals Ultimate Repair Overnight Serum allows you to get ahead on your morning styling routine. Suitable for all types of hair damage, the leave-in treatment creates an invisible shield over the lengths while you sleep, helping to protect against tangling, moisture loss and snapping."" The miniature serum is blended with omega-9 and promises to offer 'instant' and 'long-term' results. Since getting my hair regularly bleached I've noticed slight areas of breakage, particularly on the root area, so I wanted to make sure I found a product that wasn't too pricey and easy to apply. The verdict Not only does the serum smell amazing, and like you've just come out of the salon - but it makes my hair feel noticeably more soft too. I like to apply a generous amount from just below the root to the tip of my hair (considering my hair is quite short) and let it dry naturally if I can. I'm left with soft, silky locks that look shiny, as opposed to dry bleached ends which is what I'm usually faced with. It's recommended on the LOOKFANTASTIC website that you use this product in the evening, but I'm not overly strict on that. One pump is the recommended amount, but sometimes I like to do two if I'm feeling extra indulgent. I've only ever used this serum on wet hair, so I can't comment on what it would feel like applying it to dry hair. Don't just take my word for it though, plenty of shoppers have been praising the Wella product on the LOOKFANTASTIC website. One shopper said: ""This serum is a game-changer for damaged hair. I wake up with softer, smoother strands every time. It's lightweight, non-greasy, and smells great. A little goes a long way—definitely worth it!"" A second review read: ""This works absolute wonders on my hair overnight. no matter how messy it is from a slick back bun or lack of brushing throughout the day, my hair is so shiny and soft when I wake up after using this. Its become a staple In my routine I can't be without and perfect for healthy looking hair in between washes."" A third fan added: ""Couldn't recommend this product anymore!! It is a great size for travel and works wonders for my bleach damaged ends."" If you like the sound of this Wella hair mask, you can purchase it here for £20. Alternatively, Amazon is selling this L'Oréal Professionnel for £18.25 instead of £27 that shoppers say makes their hair feel 'lightweight' and 'smooth'.","Keeping your hair soft and smooth can be a real challenge, particularly if you're a fan of getting it bleached like I am.

n1jnsz1,"  Ok so for shampooing you want take maybe an amount a little bigger than a quarter and then rub it a bunch between wet hands. Then apply directly on the scalp, not the lengths (those will get cleaned off when you wash and squeeze the shampoo out) and gently rub it in with your fingers. conditioner should only be applied on the mid lengths and below (and then scrunch). Keep it in and detangle. Then squish to condish which is basically cupping a bunch of water in your hands and squishing/scrunching it into your hair. Then repeat until the resulting water runs clear or your hair stops dripping. I personally prefer to do squish to condish with leave in conditioner (same rules apply for applying leave in) because that's the next step and because rinsing out ALL of the conditioner will kind ruin the curl clumps and I'm not sure about leaving in rinse out conditioner because it's not technically meant for that. YMMV. Then after, step out of the shower. For some people with finer textured hair, water weighs down the hair, so they use a microfiber towel (not a regular towel) to scrunch out excess water before styling (styling on damp hair). For others, styling on soaking wet hair is the best way to go. I've tried both and I think it works better if I scrunch out a little but not too much. YMMV. So people like to use a separate brush for styling. Either the denman brush (I've heard it's a bit difficult to get the hang of), or one of the bounce curl brushes (I use the volumizing one and honestly it's improved my routine so much!) For the best results, you want to section your hair with claw clips. Most people do 4 sections horizontally. Make sure you have a spray bottle to rewet each section before starting. Take a mousse and apply (I use the praying hands method or I apply the mousse directly on the brush). Use the brush to style. You want to brush the hair away from the scalp, causing tension. There are videos on how to do this, it's kind of complicated. I still haven't figured out how to brush style by looping the hair around the brush 💀. Very scared to try it. Do this stuff to each section. I haven't tried brush styling with gel. Take about a quarter sized (or slightly bigger) amount of gel and rub it between wet hands (like you're supposed to do with the shampoo). Add more water if you want to dilute the gel. Use praying hands method and scrunch. Some people use a microfiber towel before doing this step or after doing this step (instead of doing it before styling) but I personally don't understand the logic because wouldn't that wipe off most of the product (or maybe it would just take off the excess?) idk. I personally wait a few mins before putting on gel so that the excess water dries out and doesn't weigh down the curls (but I'm not sure if it actually does that or not). I don't use a diffuser so I can't say much about that but I'm pretty sure this is the part where you diffuse. You're gonna want heat protectant if you diffuse. Also, you will get better results diffusing than air drying. Halfway or 60-80% through drying (regardless of air drying or diffusing) some people apply a tiny bit more gel or mousse. I haven't tried this. YMMV. Once your hair is completely dry, you take a few drops of oil and either scrunch them in your hair (scrunching out the crunchy feeling of product) or lightly clap them into your hair. You don't need to do this entire process every day. Maybe once a week ish. On other days, do a refresh routine. Wet your hair with a spray bottle (the water reactivates the products you already put on the day before) and either put leave in and detangle and then put a tiny bit of gel and/or mousse, or just the tiny bit of gel and/or mousse. Some other things you might need: A spray bottle (definitely need) A deep conditioner (for moisture) (eg not your mother's matcha butter mask) (use treatments every other week or so/if needed. There are ways to tell if your hair is over moisturized, or has too much protein (idk if you can find out if it has too little of both or too much of both) A protein treatment (for protein) (eg hask henna and placenta mask, hask k18, aphogee two step (this one is complicated and long), Curlsmith bond curl rehab salve) A silk or satin bonnet (to preserve the curls overnight) (I haven't gotten one yet)...","Ok so for shampooing you want take maybe an amount a little bigger than a quarter and then rub it a bunch between wet hands.

n2z3l42,  It's probably the humidity here. It's been so rainy and awful in CTX I have curly hair and hate every summer bc of frizz. You should perhaps try an oil like the verb ghost oil! I hear good things and it's not greasy. Leave in conditioner will be heavy for you unless you get something thin or lighter or like a spray I use leave in luv ur curls Amazon and the hair gel they sell. I like both. I also use k18 sometimes bc I've dyed my hair. It's expensive but it works imo. I also want to try a bit of oil or a serum. This summer my hair has done a lot better. Definitely try an oil / serum but lighter one. Also the luv ur curls has wavy hair product too!,It's probably the humidity here.
