1lorvnl,"  Hello, I'm a 30-year-old woman and I am very interested in working in law enforcement, but I've made some bad decisions in my past. I'm wondering if I have any chance of becoming an officer, or if my history would make that impossible. I know it's a lot, but I was hoping there might still be a chance since I can show that I've changed and grown from my past. Here's what I've done (I'm not proud of any of it): * Grew and ate magic mushrooms a couple of times around age 15. * Trespassed in an abandoned daycare/church and an abandoned school around age 15. * Stole candy from a gas station when I was about 15. * Grew weed for personal use when I was about 17. * Have $20k in unpaid credit card debt from a failed business between ages 18–22. It has dropped off my credit report, but I still plan to repay it if my income allows. * Engaged in prostitution when I was 21 due to desperation and nearly being homeless. This is something I deeply regret. * Returned items worth around $30 to Amazon claiming they were defective when they weren't (around age 21). * Stole a $30 temperature gun from my work as a cashier around age 21 (impulsive decision, also deeply regret). * Smoked meth one time around age 25. My brother, who I looked up to at the time, pressured me to try it. I have completely cut him and other negative influences out of my life for years now. * I am prescribed Ritalin for ADHD, which I have taken legally since around age 25. * I do not have a strong work history. I've done things like selling items online, starting a bath and body business that eventually failed, tried an Airbnb rental business that failed, worked as a cashier, and worked as a bartender from around ages 18–24. After that, I followed my spouse's career while we moved frequently. I became a homemaker and raised our son while attending university and studying the local language. I also got certified to teach English and taught online part-time for a while. I recently graduated and am looking to start a stable career now. Here are some positive things I'm hoping might offset my past: * Never been arrested, never charged with anything. Completely clean legal and driving record. * Recently completed a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Project Management, with a 3.7 GPA. First-generation college graduate. * Got a Thai language education visa and traveled to Thailand to study Thai when I was around 25. I am now bilingual. This was around the time I really started turning my life around. * I am currently enrolled in an intensive Muay Thai training program in Thailand, which I will finish in six months. After that, I plan to return to the U.S. and start the application process for law enforcement. I am open to relocating anywhere in the U.S. (my spouse works remotely). * I have been clean from all illegal drugs and illegal or unethical activity for at least five years. I do still drink socially and have used marijuana socially in places where it is legal, but I have recently quit marijuana since I know it is not compatible with a career in law enforcement. I understand the severity of some of these things, but I am not the same person I used to be. I was wondering if there is any realistic chance that I could work in law enforcement. I've learned from my mistakes and I genuinely want to do something meaningful with my life. I know a lot of departments are short-staffed right now and are hiring, but I also fully understand why LE would be hesitant to hire someone with my background. I would be very grateful for any honest feedback, especially from someone who knows the background process.","Hello, I'm a 30-year-old woman and I am very interested in working in law enforcement, but I've made some bad decisions in my past.

mov_8A9252901D74A38E23DB03B1D7E5202F,"  A Caltech-led team has developed a safe, effective, and painless breast imaging technique that incorporates machine learning to help differentiate between suspicious and healthy tissue. The method has now been tested on patients and performs as well as or better than other conventional breast imaging techniques. For decades, X-ray mammography has been the gold standard of breast imaging for the early detection of breast cancer. While the technique remains valuable in terms of reducing cancer deaths, it does expose patients to small amounts of ionizing radiation, painfully squeezes breasts to allow X-rays to more easily pass through tissue, and, especially in the case of dense breast tissue, produces many false positive diagnoses. Other techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used for breast imaging, but these also have problems. Ultrasound is very safe, but its accuracy is dependent on the skill of the operator and the results are not always conclusive. MRI is time-intensive, expensive, and cannot be used on patients who are allergic to contrast agents or those who are claustrophobic or have certain implants. The technique that Wang and his colleagues have developed and refined over the past 20 years is called photoacoustic computed tomography, or PACT. It offers a breast imaging alternative without the discomfort, high costs, or risk associated with the conventional evaluation methods. PACT features a laser-sonic scanner that can identify tumors in as little as 15 seconds. Working with researchers at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, California, the team has tested PACT on 39 patients. It achieved comparable results to mammography and MRI in terms of differentiating between suspicious and normal tissue as well as malignant and benign growths or lumps. The scientists describe PACT and their clinical results in a new paper in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. The lead authors of the paper are Xin Tong (MS '21), Cindy Z. Liu, and Yilin Luo, graduate students in the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Department of Medical Engineering at Caltech; along with Li Lin (PhD '20), who completed the work while at Caltech and is now at Zhejiang University in China. ""This is the culmination of literally decades of work,"" says Wang, who is also the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Medical Engineering Leadership Chair and executive officer for medical engineering at Caltech. ""We'd like to make PACT a clinical tool that benefits patients-to help detect breast cancer without patients taking the risk of getting cancer or worrying about an allergic reaction."" How it works PACT works by shining a near-infrared laser pulse into the breast tissue. The laser light diffuses through the breast and is absorbed by molecules. For example, it can be absorbed by oxygen-carrying hemoglobin molecules in the patient's red blood cells, causing the molecules to vibrate ultrasonically. Unlike X-rays, which travel in a straight line, light waves scatter, or bounce around inside tissues, making it difficult to get high-resolution images. So PACT combines light and sound into a single modality. ""We use light to see the molecules, but we use sound to define the spatial location,"" Wang says. The vibrations from the molecules travel through the tissue and are picked up by an array of 512 tiny ultrasonic sensors placed over the skin of the breast. Data from those sensors are used to assemble an image of the breast's internal structures in a process that is similar to ultrasound imaging, though much more precise. PACT can provide a clear view of structures as small as a quarter of a millimeter at a depth of 4 centimeters. ""We basically use molecules to figure out the body's physiology,"" Wang says. ""That's the beauty of photoacoustic tomography: By detecting molecules, we can figure out exactly how the body is functioning. When there's a functional difference, that means we can potentially detect disease better."" For example, PACT is excellent at detecting hemoglobin and therefore revealing angiogenesis, a common signature of breast cancer that involves the growth of additional blood vessels to deliver more nutrient-rich blood to cancerous cells. PACT can also detect tumor hypoxia, another signature of cancer, where fast metabolism outstrips the blood supply, leaving parts of the tumor starved of oxygen. Machine learning can detect suspicious tissue, sometimes before humans can With the maturity of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, Wang says PACT has become better at detecting abnormalities in breast tissue than it was a few years ago. The scientists trained the system on images of malignant and benign growths or lumps as well as suspicious and healthy tissue, improving its ability to notice subtle variations that indicate what type of tissue has been imaged. Indeed, Wang says, PACT can often detect problematic features that would likely go unnoticed by the human eye. The patient experience During a PACT scan, the patient lies face down on a table with a recess containing a warm water bath, ultrasonic sensors, and the laser. One breast at a time is placed in the recess, and the laser shines into it from below. Because the technique is rapid, each scan can be accomplished while the patient holds their breath. ""We started with a basic lab system-just a single-element ultrasound transducer that we rotated around-and it took forever. Now we can do 3D imaging during a single breath, making it very practical,"" Wang says. Wang adds that in some ways, the new work is just the beginning, as the team believes it will be able to further enhance the technique's imaging quality by adding additional laser wavelengths to the two they currently use and improving additional features. Looking to the future, the team's next steps include acquiring a larger dataset from additional breast cancer volunteers, improving the classification model by leveraging more features, and eventually commercializing the technology.

At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.91% at 44,494.94, while the S&P 500 lost 0.11% to 6,198.01 and the Nasdaq Composite saw out the session 0.82% softer at 20,202.89. The Dow closed 400.17 points higher on Tuesday, building on gains recorded in the previous session, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite retreated from their recent record highs. Tuesday's primary focus was comments from Powell, with the Fed head revealing that the central bank would have already eased monetary policy by now if not for Donald Trump's tariff so-called ""Liberation Day"" tariffs. ""In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,"" said Powell. Powell's comments come just a day after Donald Trump sent him a handwritten note demanding ultra-low interest rates. ""Jerome – Ikaw, gaya ng dati, 'too late.' Nagkakahalaga ka ng USA - at patuloy na gawin ito - dapat mong babaan ang rate - nang malaki!"" sabi ni Trump. ""Daan-daang bilyong dolyar ang nawawala! Walang inflation."" Elsewhere, Elon Musk criticised Trump's megabill, branding it as ""utterly insane and destructive"". However, the bill passed in the Senate on Tuesday in a 51-50 vote and will now move on to the House, which can still reject recent changes to the legislation. Sa harap ng macro, Pandaigdigang S&P's manufacturing PMI rose to 52.9 in June, up from 52 in May and ahead of both a flash estimate of 52 and expectations of 51. Output rose for the first time in four months and at the second-fastest pace since March 2024 amid higher demand for capacity. On the price front, input costs accelerated the most in nearly three years, driving output charges to jump their highest level since September 2022. On another note, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI ticked up to 49 in June, up from 48.5 in May and ahead of expectations of 48.8. While economic activity in the manufacturing sector contracted for the fourth consecutive month, the rate of contraction slowed amid a rebound in production and improvements in inventories. Still on data, the US economy created 374,000 jobs in May, according to ang Bureau of Labor Statistics, habang ang mga pagbubukas ng trabaho ay tumaas sa 7.76m, na may pinakamalaking kita na nakikita sa mga serbisyo sa tirahan at pagkain. Sa kabaligtaran, bumaba ng 39,000 ang mga bakanteng trabaho sa pederal na pamahalaan ng US. Sa wakas, ang paggasta sa pagtatayo ng US ay bumaba ng 0.30% buwan-sa-buwan noong Mayo, ayon sa ang Census Bureau, bumababa sa isang seasonally adjusted annualized rate na $2.13trn mula sa binagong 0.4% na pagbaba ng Abril. Sa corporate space, nagbabahagi ng Facebook parent company Mga Meta Platform nakipagkalakalan nang mas mataas matapos ang tech giant ay nagsiwalat ng mga plano para sa isang AI lab na nakatuon sa ""superintelligence"" na magsasama ng mga mananaliksik na na-poach mula sa OpenAI, habang ang electric carmaker Tesla nakipagkalakalan nang mas mababa pagkatapos imungkahi ni Donald Trump iyon ang Department of Government Efficiency dapat tingnan ang mga subsidiya na natanggap ng mga kumpanya sa ilalim ng pamumuno ni Elon Musk.

mov_D539C215683E783F9B5EF46A366C9CE0,"  A woman who was beaten, burned and starved as a child has said it is never too late to seek justice after her mother was jailed for abusing her more than 50 years ago. Caroline Eshghi said she was subjected to years of ""terror"" by her mother, Melanie Burmingham, while living in Bristol, Somerset, and Wiltshire during the 1970s and 80s. Burmingham, 76, was jailed for 20 months in May after Ms Eshghi, 57, successfully appealed the initial suspended sentence. Now she is campaigning for a change in the law around sentencing guidelines for historical child abuse cases. ""My childhood was definitely stolen from me,"" she told the BBC. ""When you've survived child abuse, it never really goes away."" Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing Ms Eshghi, who now lives in Cornwall, grew up at houses in Redland in Bristol, Long Ashton on the outskirts of the city, Midsomer Norton in Somerset and Avebury in Wiltshire before she ran away at the age of 15. One of her earliest memories is being five-years-old and in a house with an L-shaped hallway, where she remembers being ""drop-kicked like a human football"". ""The viciousness of it made me pee blood,"" she said. Ms Eshghi recalls being put in the bath where her mother would hold her head under the water and turn out the lights, and being made to sleep on the floor. ""I used to sleep next to the bed that she was in and randomly through the night she would just lean over while I was sleeping on the floor and punch me, so I would be lying there in terror."" ""I think at the age of nine is when she became an alcoholic and the hell was amplified quite a bit,"" Ms Eshghi added. ""She would smash things, she split my face open with a broken glass butter dish. ""She would tell me to get the walking stick and make me kneel in front of her while she beat me with it and she put out cigarettes on my body."" Ms Eshghi said she would be sent to school unwashed, wearing broken wellington boots, with just a cream cracker in her lunchbox. ""I used to have the nickname Paddington Bear at school,"" she added. ""School dinners were torture for me because I had nothing and I used to watch the other children eating lovely food."" 'Seriously failed' Ms Eshghi said she was ""hugely let down"" by Bristol social services, formerly Avon social services, which she said allowed her to ""slip through the net"" despite referrals from schools she attended. ""The only thing I remember is that a lady used to come and visit and ask 'does your mum hit you?' ""Of course I was going to say no. As soon as she left I was beaten and assaulted."" Ms Eshghi made the decision to report the abuse she suffered to police in 2019. ""I was told on the phone that the records from that time were not looked after as they should have been and were put in a basement that flooded and many were lost,"" she said. Avon and Somerset Police launched an investigation and four years later, in March 2023, Burmingham was charged with one count of cruelty to a person under 16 years contrary to section 1 of the Children and Young Person Act 1933. She was given a 20-month suspended sentence after pleading guilty during trial at Portsmouth Crown Court. In May, Ms Eshghi appealed her mother's suspended sentence. ""I thought that was it, that was done,"" she said. ""But it went straight to the Attorney General who agreed that the sentence was unduly lenient."" The case was escalated to the Court of Appeal and on 23 May, Burmingham was sent to prison for 20 months. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith stated that if he was trying the case now he would be looking at a minimum term of nine years and a maximum of 14 years. Under current laws, judges can only pass a sentence within the maximum term available at the time of the offending but Ms Eshghi has launched a petition calling for this to change. ""The way the law works is that if you are taking a historical case through the judicial system for child abuse, they have to adhere to the sentencing rules of when the abuse took place. ""I would like the law changed so that historical cases will be charged on current sentencing guidelines and not on the guidelines from decades ago."" The Ministry of Justice has been approached for comment. Ms Eshghi said she feels a ""sense of peace"" knowing her mother has been sent to prison. ""When you are abused, it is part of you,"" she said. ""But you heal in such a way that you're not in denial of it. You're not ashamed of it. ""I'm very lucky, I've got wonderful children, I live in a beautiful home in a beautiful part of the world. I am blessed"". Historic files search A spokesperson for Bristol City Council said: ""The events described by Caroline are awful and should never be an environment any child has to experience. ""Whilst we cannot answer for a council and a social services regime that no longer exist, we are pleased to see that Caroline has received some form of justice but recognise that this does not remove the impact of the abuse experienced as a child. ""A search for historic files associated with this case was undertaken following a request received from the police. ""Three separate and extensive searches were undertaken in 2020, 2022 and 2023 but were unable to identify any records that matched the details given by police. ""The protocols often in place over 40 years ago meant that when an individual left the local authority area, their case files were transferred to the council for the area the person moved to.

'Seriously failed' Ms Eshghi said she was ""hugely let down"" by Bristol social services, formerly Avon social services, which she said allowed her to ""slip through the net"" despite referrals from schools she attended. ""The only thing I remember is that a lady used to come and visit and ask 'does your mum hit you?' ""Of course I was going to say no. As soon as she left I was beaten and assaulted."" Ms Eshghi made the decision to report the abuse she suffered to police in 2019. ""I was told on the phone that the records from that time were not looked after as they should have been and were put in a basement that flooded and many were lost,"" she said. Ms Eshghi's mum, Melanie Burmingham, was jailed for 20 months in May [Family handout] Avon and Somerset Police launched an investigation and four years later, in March 2023, Burmingham was charged with one count of cruelty to a person under 16 years contrary to section 1 of the Children and Young Person Act 1933. She was given a 20-month suspended sentence after pleading guilty during trial at Portsmouth Crown Court. In May, Ms Eshghi appealed her mother's suspended sentence. ""I thought that was it, that was done,"" she said. ""But it went straight to the Attorney General who agreed that the sentence was unduly lenient."" The case was escalated to the Court of Appeal and on 23 May, Burmingham was sent to prison for 20 months. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith stated that if he was trying the case now he would be looking at a minimum term of nine years and a maximum of 14 years. Under current laws, judges can only pass a sentence within the maximum term available at the time of the offending but Ms Eshghi has launched a petition calling for this to change. ""The way the law works is that if you are taking a historical case through the judicial system for child abuse, they have to adhere to the sentencing rules of when the abuse took place. ""I would like the law changed so that historical cases will be charged on current sentencing guidelines and not on the guidelines from decades ago."" The Ministry of Justice has been approached for comment. Ms Eshghi said she feels a ""sense of peace"" knowing her mother has been sent to prison. ""When you are abused, it is part of you,"" she said. ""But you heal in such a way that you're not in denial of it. You're not ashamed of it. ""I'm very lucky, I've got wonderful children, I live in a beautiful home in a beautiful part of the world. I am blessed"". Historic files search A spokesperson for Bristol City Council said: ""The events described by Caroline are awful and should never be an environment any child has to experience. ""Whilst we cannot answer for a council and a social services regime that no longer exist, we are pleased to see that Caroline has received some form of justice but recognise that this does not remove the impact of the abuse experienced as a child. ""A search for historic files associated with this case was undertaken following a request received from the police. ""Three separate and extensive searches were undertaken in 2020, 2022 and 2023 but were unable to identify any records that matched the details given by police....",2025-07-02 05:09:50,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"This content is a news article about child abuse and does not contain any reference to Bath & Body Works, its fragrances, products, or brand experience.

mov_8B2371A78150ABB695F2310A47C1B9E7,"  Among the most cherished and iconic natural fragrances in the world, rose attar original holds a place of unmatched elegance. Renowned for its rich floral aroma and therapeutic properties, this luxurious attar has been a symbol of love, beauty, and purity for centuries. Crafted from the petals of fresh roses—often the famed Damask or desi gulab varieties—this natural perfume oil is more than just a scent; it is a legacy passed down through generations of perfumers. What sets rose attar original apart from synthetic rose fragrances is its authenticity. It is distilled using age-old traditional methods, often in Kannauj, India—the perfume capital of the country—where natural attar-making techniques are still preserved and honored. Unlike mass-produced rose perfumes, the original version of rose attar contains no alcohol, synthetic chemicals, or artificial preservatives. It is a pure, potent oil that offers a deeper, more complex experience than any laboratory-created scent ever could. The Art of Crafting Rose Attar Original The making of rose attar original is a highly refined and time-intensive process. At its heart is the hydro-distillation method, which captures the essence of thousands of fresh rose petals. Here's how it works: Harvesting the Roses: Only fresh petals are used, often plucked in the early morning when their scent is strongest. Damask roses are preferred due to their deep, spicy, and slightly honeyed aroma. Distillation: The petals are placed in large copper vessels (degs) filled with water. These are heated slowly while the steam carries the rose oil into a separate receiver (bhapka) containing a natural base oil—typically sandalwood. Infusion and Aging: The rose essence infuses into the sandalwood oil, and the attar is aged for several weeks or months to allow the blend to mature and deepen in aroma. The result is a golden or pale amber-hued oil with an intensely rich floral scent—soft yet powerful, romantic yet grounded. Distinguishing Features of Rose Attar Original While there are many rose-based perfumes in the market, identifying rose attar original requires an understanding of its unique qualities: Natural Ingredients: Authentic rose attar uses real rose petals and natural sandalwood oil as a base. It is free from alcohol and synthetic fixatives. Complex Aroma: Unlike one-dimensional synthetic perfumes, rose attar has layers of scent that unfold over time—from the initial burst of freshness to a warm, woody dry-down. Long-Lasting: Being oil-based, rose attar lingers on the skin for hours. Just a drop on the wrist or neck can provide all-day fragrance. Non-Irritating: With no harsh chemicals, it is gentle on sensitive skin and ideal for those who prefer natural products. Eco-Friendly: The traditional distillation process is environmentally conscious and sustainable, relying on small-scale artisan production rather than industrial methods. Benefits of Using Rose Attar Original Beyond its enchanting aroma, rose attar original offers several emotional, spiritual, and physical benefits: 1. Uplifts Mood and Reduces Stress Rose oil has long been associated with emotional healing. Its scent is known to calm the mind, reduce anxiety, and promote a sense of peace and well-being. 2. Natural Aphrodisiac The scent of rose is inherently romantic. It has been used for centuries to kindle passion and intimacy, making it a favorite for special occasions and personal use. 3. Enhances Skin Health Rose attar, when diluted with a carrier oil, can be used as a skincare remedy. It helps tone the skin, reduce inflammation, and add a natural glow. 4. Supports Spiritual Practice Used widely in meditation, prayer, and religious ceremonies, rose attar is believed to purify the aura and open the heart chakra. 5. Safe for Daily Use Without alcohol or synthetic chemicals, it's perfect for everyday wear. Unlike spray perfumes, it doesn't dry out the skin or cause allergies. Versatile Ways to Use Rose Attar Original The beauty of rose attar original lies in its versatility. It can be used in various ways, each enhancing its charm:...","Among the most cherished and iconic natural fragrances in the world, rose attar original holds a place of unmatched elegance.

n12uhbq,"  I have recovered from this condition (it took years) and I am now able to actually enjoy flying believe it or not. Here is what worked for me... 1) Exposure therapy - essentially flying alot. By flying repeatedly I built up a backlog of neutral flight experiences. I began to get used to the normal aspects of flying (the boarding and check in process, turbulence,  deplaning, etc). 2) Learning about the science of flight- this helped me catastrophize less about every noise and movement I encounter on a plane. I also learned that choosing seats on the wings meant less feelings of turbulence so I now choose seats that make me feel better. 3) Upgrading- I splurge on creature comforts for myself when I fly. I upgrade to extra leg room seats and early boarding. I let myself eat whatever overpriced bullshit I want at the airport. I got an airline credit card to earn perks when flying with the same airline and I fly direct whenever possible. 4) Medication- I hear you that you have struggled with substances so many meds are not a fit. See if you can get some non habit -forming meds to ease your flight experience. By racking up experiences on planes where you are able to stay calm over time you teach yourself not to freak out. 5) Flight sensory tool kit- I bring items to help myself feel clean. I always bring disinfectant wipes and wipe down my seat, seat belt and window as soon as I board. This makes the plane feel clean and safe. I keep small bottles of hand sanitizer and lotion, face wipes (sometimes a cool wipe on the face is nice if Im having a hard time, can also be used to sponge bath in the restroom during really long international flights). I also bring items that offer different sensory experiences like sour candy, snacks, aromatherapy drops for my wrists, a big light blocking eye mask, quiet fidgets, a refillable water bottle, a tiny stuffed toy, neck pillow, and a big light weight scarf that can act as blanket if needed. Being comfortable is extremely important. 6) Flight playlist- I have two curated playlists (one of Feist and one of Astrud Gilberto, upbeat & calming tracks ONLY) I listen to these on repeat. You'll have to do some reflecting to see what will work for you. 7) Homemade Flashcards- I made a set of flash cards to take with me on a flight... the flashcards have the following things on them...A) Photos of places I dream of visiting some day (Hawaii, Italy, Japan etc), B) images of flying that have a positive association for me (stills of Kiki flying on her broom from kiki's deliver service) C) instructions for breathing and relaxation techniques to counteract panic (like counting backwards from 100, full body scan etc), D) Photos of art works I love (paintings by Odilon Redon). I flip through these as needed when I'm having issues on the flight. 8) The Bag- I bring a lightweight reusable nylon bag (think a baggu nylon bag) and tuck it into the seat pocket under the tray table at my seat. I then put any items I need (wet wipes, fidgets, my water bottle, my flight flash cards) inside the bag. When its time to deplane I grab the bag and go. I dont have to worry about accidentally leaving anything in the seat pocket because its all in the bag. Being prone to anxiety on flights could mean accidentally losing my items on a plane so this technique just gives me one less thing to stress about. Things Ive learned about myself... I love looking out the window on a plane. Even at my most scared I still find looking down and seeing everything miniaturized super cool. I love seeing cloud formations up close and Ive learned the big puffy clouds that I love looking at tend to make for bumpy flights so I am more prepared for those bumps.

With average highs reaching 43°C (109°F) in July and August with humidity levels soaring past 70%, traditional outdoor workouts become nearly impossible. GymNation's new class offers a refreshing alternative, combining cutting-edge fitness programming with temperature-controlled training to deliver maximum impact, without the meltdown. Rory McEntee, Chief Marketing Officer at GymNation, stated: ""At GymNation, we pride ourselves on being the people's gym and that means listening to what our members need. When the summer heat hits its peak in July and August, finding ways to stay active without overheating becomes a real challenge. With 'The Coolest Class in Dubai,' we're turning that challenge into an opportunity offering a fun, refreshing way to beat the heat while still smashing fitness and wellness goals."" Cold workouts place additional demands on the cardiovascular system, enhancing heart function and circulation. Beyond physical advantages, training in the cold builds mental toughness, requiring focus, discipline, and resilience to push through discomfort.

mov_E88D883268E7F14D210875670F18360C,"  A team led by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has developed a safe, effective, and painless breast imaging technique that incorporates machine learning to help differentiate between suspicious and healthy tissue. The method has now been tested on patients and performs as well as or better than other conventional breast imaging techniques. For decades, X-ray mammography has been the gold standard of breast imaging for the early detection of breast cancer. While the technique remains valuable in terms of reducing cancer deaths, it does expose patients to small amounts of ionizing radiation, painfully squeezes breasts to allow X-rays to more easily pass through tissue, and, especially in the case of dense breast tissue, produces many false positive diagnoses. We'd like to make PACT a clinical tool that benefits patients—to help detect breast cancer without patients taking the risk of getting cancer or worrying about an allergic reaction Lihong Wang Other techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used for breast imaging, but these also have problems. Ultrasound is very safe, but its accuracy is dependent on the skill of the operator and the results are not always conclusive. MRI is time-intensive, expensive, and cannot be used on patients who are allergic to contrast agents or those who are claustrophobic or have certain implants. ""We were strongly motivated to work on this problem because none of the current techniques are perfect,"" says Lihong Wang, the Bren Professor of Medical Engineering and Electrical Engineering at Caltech. ""The future of medicine has to be better than that."" The technique that Wang and his colleagues have developed and refined over the past 20 years is called photoacoustic computed tomography, or PACT. It offers a breast imaging alternative without the discomfort, high costs, or risk associated with the conventional evaluation methods. PACT features a laser-sonic scanner that can identify tumors in as little as 15 seconds. Working with researchers at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, California, the team has tested PACT on 39 patients. It achieved comparable results to mammography and MRI in terms of differentiating between suspicious and normal tissue as well as malignant and benign growths or lumps. The scientists describe PACT and their clinical results in a new paper in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. The lead authors of the paper are Xin Tong (MS '21), Cindy Z. Liu, and Yilin Luo, graduate students in the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Department of Medical Engineering at Caltech; along with Li Lin (PhD '20), who completed the work while at Caltech and is now at Zhejiang University in China. Recommended article News • Breast cancer Of the quarter-million women diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the United States, about 180,000 undergo surgery to remove the cancerous tissue while preserving as much healthy breast tissue as possible. However, there's no accurate method to tell during surgery whether all of the cancerous tissue has been successfully removed. ""This is the culmination of literally decades of work,"" says Wang, who is also the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Medical Engineering Leadership Chair and executive officer for medical engineering at Caltech. ""We'd like to make PACT a clinical tool that benefits patients—to help detect breast cancer without patients taking the risk of getting cancer or worrying about an allergic reaction."" PACT works by shining a near-infrared laser pulse into the breast tissue. The laser light diffuses through the breast and is absorbed by molecules. For example, it can be absorbed by oxygen-carrying hemoglobin molecules in the patient's red blood cells, causing the molecules to vibrate ultrasonically. Images of the same breast in two patients with invasive ductal carcinoma, shown from mammography (left), contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, middle), and non-invasive photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT, right). PACT is less affected by breast density than mammography and reveals more feeding vessels than MRI, as indicated by dashed arrows. Image credit: Xin Tong/Caltech Optical Imaging Laboratory Unlike X-rays, which travel in a straight line, light waves scatter, or bounce around inside tissues, making it difficult to get high-resolution images. So PACT combines light and sound into a single modality. ""We use light to see the molecules, but we use sound to define the spatial location,"" Wang says. The vibrations from the molecules travel through the tissue and are picked up by an array of 512 tiny ultrasonic sensors placed over the skin of the breast. Data from those sensors are used to assemble an image of the breast's internal structures in a process that is similar to ultrasound imaging, though much more precise. PACT can provide a clear view of structures as small as a quarter of a millimeter at a depth of 4 centimeters. ""We basically use molecules to figure out the body's physiology,"" Wang says. ""That's the beauty of photoacoustic tomography: By detecting molecules, we can figure out exactly how the body is functioning. When there's a functional difference, that means we can potentially detect disease better."" For example, PACT is excellent at detecting hemoglobin and therefore revealing angiogenesis, a common signature of breast cancer that involves the growth of additional blood vessels to deliver more nutrient-rich blood to cancerous cells. PACT can also detect tumor hypoxia, another signature of cancer, where fast metabolism outstrips the blood supply, leaving parts of the tumor starved of oxygen. With the maturity of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, Wang says PACT has become better at detecting abnormalities in breast tissue than it was a few years ago. The scientists trained the system on images of malignant and benign growths or lumps as well as suspicious and healthy tissue, improving its ability to notice subtle variations that indicate what type of tissue has been imaged. Indeed, Wang says, PACT can often detect problematic features that would likely go unnoticed by the human eye. During a PACT scan, the patient lies face down on a table with a recess containing a warm water bath, ultrasonic sensors, and the laser. One breast at a time is placed in the recess, and the laser shines into it from below. Because the technique is rapid, each scan can be accomplished while the patient holds their breath. ""We started with a basic lab system—just a single-element ultrasound transducer that we rotated around—and it took forever. Now we can do 3D imaging during a single breath, making it very practical,"" Wang says. Wang adds that in some ways, the new work is just the beginning, as the team believes it will be able to further enhance the technique's imaging quality by adding additional laser wavelengths to the two they currently use and improving additional features....","A team led by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has developed a safe, effective, and painless breast imaging technique that incorporates machine learning to help differentiate between suspicious and healthy tissue.

The Final Four: • Fairlane Town Center (Dearborn) • Southland Center (Taylor) • Laurel Park Place (Livonia) • Westland Mall (Westland) Each mall is scored on foot traffic, food court availability, and how many people are still pretending it's 2007. Southland is a top seed, powered by Cinemark, Ulta, H&M, and a Best Buy. “You can still get a pretzel and your eyebrows done in one trip,” said Mike Hunt, local shopper. “That's more than I can say for my marriage.” Fairlane, once counted out, is surging after renovations. With Macy's, H&M, Sephora, Zara, and a lively food court, it's the surprise comeback of the bracket. “It's the only place I've seen a working escalator and a Cinnabon in the same day,” said Buster Highman, local shopper and voter. Laurel Park wins points for being clean, calm, and oddly soothing. Anchored by Von Maur and Dunham's, it's basically a quiet place for mall walkers. “It's like a mall on Ambien,” said a former mall employee, Dia Rhea. Westland Mall is the wildcard. Most stores are gone, but a stubborn handful like Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret still hang on. “You go for the nostalgia,” said Westland resident Drew Peacock, “and because the ghost of Payless whispers deals to you in the hallway.” Meanwhile, Somerset and 12 Oaks are watching the bracket like rich cousins at a family reunion. “We don't really get involved with that side of the family,” said Somerset shopper, Dick Hertz. “But good luck to… whichever one has the pretzels.” The winner will receive a championship banner made from Auntie Anne's napkins and a Bath & Body Works candle labeled “Last One Lit.” Voting ends next week…assuming none of them shut down first.","With Eastland, Northland, and Wonderland gone, Wayne County residents have launched a March Madness-style bracket to decide which mall will be the last to survive.

mov_99826F6DAC649A633CFAF2B9FD87B2BD,"  Subject of a fierce bidding war, this charming debut shows Trevelyan has an impressive knack for character, but is let down by a predictable plot Writing a story from a child's perspective works like a filter over a lens. Novels such as Sofie Laguna's The Eye of the Sheep, Craig Silvey's Jasper Jones and Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time use a younger person's narration to process darker, adult themes and reveal the mythologies of the adult world. Jennifer Trevelyan's debut A Beautiful Family uses a similar framing to tell an immersive yet imperfect coming-of-age mystery set in New Zealand. It's 1985, and 10-year-old Alix – a tomboyish, inquisitive girl who is never without her red Walkman and Split Enz cassette tape – is on holiday with her family, who have left their Wellington home for the nearby Kāpiti Coast. Her novelist mother normally prefers secluded spots, but this time she has curiously opted for a populous beach town. Between her parents' bickering and her older sister's burgeoning interest in boys and alcohol, Alix has often felt invisible. This has made her a keen observer, and she understands more than people think. At the outset, Alix befriends a 12-year-old Māori boy named Kahu with whom she soon becomes inseparable. He invites her over to his house, which is full of cooking aunties, rowdy cousins and dogs – a contrast to Alix's loving yet somewhat siloed family. One day Kahu tells her about Charlotte, a young girl who drowned in the area a few years prior. The two children decide to search for her missing body, combing the beach and the nearby lagoon for remains. But as their investigation stretches on, other secrets begin to emerge. What is Alix's mother doing on her long walks? And who is the strange old man next door always watching them? Alix grasps at the truth of things, but her perspective means only the reader parses the more adult story unravelling around her. This framing is craftily handled, with Trevelyan building suspense as the underlying narratives coalesce, delving into familial ties, a child's desire for harmony, and the pinballing of a child on the brink of adolescence. Innocence is deftly chipped away, and some unsettling revelations begin to dawn on Alix. “Now I understood that a family wasn't a particularly solid thing,” she says. “It was a bubble purely of our own making and just like a bubble, it could burst.” A Beautiful Family is most enriching in Trevelyan's knack for character; Alix, Vanessa and her parents are all distinctive and familiar from the start, even with the story taking place from a single point of view. However, the novel stalls somewhat in pace and plot about halfway through, meandering into overwriting and a surfeit of detail – there are four consecutive pages on Alix's Walkman, for example. The novel's imagery also veers from tactile clarity (“the lagoon, flat and quiet as a bath”) to lines a bit sensorially inert. (“The soup had a dusty taste, like the inside of a long unopened cupboard.”) There's also a curious undercurrent of racial microaggressions. Alix's mother says that “Chinese people tend to look alike”. A school friend of Vanessa's, Crystal, mentions a boy with mixed parents has skin with the “perfect mix”. And when Alix is invited to Kahu's house for lunch, her mother becomes overly concerned about whether there's enough food. Trevelyan handles these inclusions delicately, and some help evoke the flawed nature of her characters. But though they appear to build towards something – an evocation of internalised prejudices, of casual discrimination, of a white child's recognition of cultural difference – they ultimately never really say anything impactful. By the novel's end, Alix and Kahu, having spent the summer playing detective, suddenly stumble across a much darker discovery. Treveylan pulls some of her threads taut while leaving others loose – and yet the secrets she does reveal are predictable and only end up undercutting her otherwise immersive story. Indeed, A Beautiful Family is a charming debut, bringing life to Tolstoy's adage that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, but it gets mired in what turns out to be a lacklustre mystery. Hopefully, Trevelyan's next work will lean more on her evident strengths.

1lqsexg,"  I think I've had BV for most of my life, though I didn't know it. Growing up, I thought using good-smelling soap would make things smell better down there. My mom always used soap on my vulva, and some would actually make it smell worse — Dove was the absolute worst. So, when I started making my own money, I went to Bath & Body Works and bought their fragranced liquid soap, thinking it would help. It did a little… but I still had a very strong odor. Whenever I had discharge, I could smell it through my clothes. It didn't always smell strongly of fish — I think my body got used to it and it mixed with my natural scent — but still, it was noticeable. I'd read articles online that said “having a smell is normal,” so I thought I was fine. I didn't know much about infections, and since I showered daily and kept up with hygiene, I assumed I was doing everything right. I do remember moments where I questioned my smell. Like… why didn't I ever notice any odor from other girls, even when we were in  close proximity? I'll never forget this one time at the club — I went to the bathroom with my friend, and since the line was long, we shared a stall. When I pulled down my underwear, there was a smell, as usual. But when she did? Nothing. That moment really stuck with me, but I never thought to bring it up to my doctor. The first time I really started to think something might be wrong was when I got on Depo-Provera. Suddenly, there was no smell at all — it was like magic. But a year later, I stopped because it affected my mood too much. That's when I noticed my natural smell returning, and I made it my mission to get back to that odorless hooha I had while on Depo. I changed soaps, use no soap, changed how I washed my vulva — and eventually, I found a “perfect” routine and stuck to it for a few years. Then one day, I was fooling around with my boyfriend and we used a sented wax candle. That's how I got diagnosed with BV for the first time (yes, I got tested). The treatment worked really well, but it gave me a yeast infection — which I didn't know at the time, so I thought it was just normal discharge. A few years later, I got BV again after some “ice play,” and that's when the recurring BV really started. I'll spare you the in-between, but fast-forward to last month: I realized I'd actually had recurrent BV this whole time. I had taken metronidazole every month since January, and more than five times last year. When I finally saw my doctor, she told me the only thing she could offer was a months-long course of metro. I'm sorry, but I wasn't about to give up terrasse season for something that might work — with no guarantee. When I went to the pharmacy to pick up the meds, I cried in front of the pharmacist. I was just so tired of this recurring infection that never seemed to fully go away — and worried about what it might do to my kidneys over time. I didn't want another “maybe.” I wanted a real plan. So, I went home, cried some more, and then did my research. That's when I learned about biofilm and boric acid. I read more, and with the help of ChatGPT (shoutout 🫶), we came up with a plan: since my BV symptoms were gone (no smell), I'd start a 14-day treatment with boric acid at night, while taking Garden of Life probiotics every morning (they contain the bacteria strains recommended for vaginal health). I just finished my 15-day boric treatment on Monday, and I've continued taking my probiotics daily (which I plan to do until the bottle runs out). I got my period yesterday — and guess what? No smell. Not before my period. Not during my period. Not even a hint. My friends… if you know, you know: the ultimate test is always your period. And so far? I think I might have cured it. I'm so, so happy. I'll update you all a few days after my period ends — but for now, this feels like the beginning of a fresh, clean chapter in my life 💕✨ (Thank you ChatGPT for correcting my text.

mov_589B6FB6058E2A60E8700958A9FB1069,"  Writing a story from a child's perspective works like a filter over a lens. Novels such as Sofie Laguna's The Eye of the Sheep, Craig Silvey's Jasper Jones and Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time use a younger person's narration to process darker, adult themes and reveal the mythologies of the adult world. Jennifer Trevelyan's debut A Beautiful Family uses a similar framing to tell an immersive yet imperfect coming-of-age mystery set in New Zealand. It's 1985, and 10-year-old Alix – a tomboyish, inquisitive girl who is never without her red Walkman and Split Enz cassette tape – is on holiday with her family, who have left their Wellington home for the nearby Kāpiti Coast. Her novelist mother normally prefers secluded spots, but this time she has curiously opted for a populous beach town. Between her parents' bickering and her older sister's burgeoning interest in boys and alcohol, Alix has often felt invisible. This has made her a keen observer, and she understands more than people think. At the outset, Alix befriends a 12-year-old Māori boy named Kahu with whom she soon becomes inseparable. He invites her over to his house, which is full of cooking aunties, rowdy cousins and dogs – a contrast to Alix's loving yet somewhat siloed family. One day Kahu tells her about Charlotte, a young girl who drowned in the area a few years prior. The two children decide to search for her missing body, combing the beach and the nearby lagoon for remains. But as their investigation stretches on, other secrets begin to emerge. What is Alix's mother doing on her long walks? And who is the strange old man next door always watching them? Related: Alix grasps at the truth of things, but her perspective means only the reader parses the more adult story unravelling around her. This framing is craftily handled, with Trevelyan building suspense as the underlying narratives coalesce, delving into familial ties, a child's desire for harmony, and the pinballing of a child on the brink of adolescence. Innocence is deftly chipped away, and some unsettling revelations begin to dawn on Alix. “Now I understood that a family wasn't a particularly solid thing,” she says. “It was a bubble purely of our own making and just like a bubble, it could burst.” A Beautiful Family is most enriching in Trevelyan's knack for character; Alix, Vanessa and her parents are all distinctive and familiar from the start, even with the story taking place from a single point of view. However, the novel stalls somewhat in pace and plot about halfway through, meandering into overwriting and a surfeit of detail – there are four consecutive pages on Alix's Walkman, for example. The novel's imagery also veers from tactile clarity (“the lagoon, flat and quiet as a bath”) to lines a bit sensorially inert. (“The soup had a dusty taste, like the inside of a long unopened cupboard.”) There's also a curious undercurrent of racial microaggressions. Alix's mother says that “Chinese people tend to look alike”. A school friend of Vanessa's, Crystal, mentions a boy with mixed parents has skin with the “perfect mix”. And when Alix is invited to Kahu's house for lunch, her mother becomes overly concerned about whether there's enough food. Trevelyan handles these inclusions delicately, and some help evoke the flawed nature of her characters. But though they appear to build towards something – an evocation of internalised prejudices, of casual discrimination, of a white child's recognition of cultural difference – they ultimately never really say anything impactful. By the novel's end, Alix and Kahu, having spent the summer playing detective, suddenly stumble across a much darker discovery. Treveylan pulls some of her threads taut while leaving others loose – and yet the secrets she does reveal are predictable and only end up undercutting her otherwise immersive story. Indeed, A Beautiful Family is a charming debut, bringing life to Tolstoy's adage that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, but it gets mired in what turns out to be a lacklustre mystery. Hopefully, Trevelyan's next work will lean more on her evident strengths.

If she's a little lonely, well, that's fine, that's what friends are for. On an out of state visit to her parents, she arrives just in time to disrupt a handsome stranger's plan to kill her parents, though why he'd want to in the first place, she cannot fathom. Instead he makes a demand for an exorbitant amount of money and to make sure he gets his money, he takes Charlotte as collateral... collateral he has no intention of keeping his hands off of. Charlotte is thrown into a world she knows nothing about, trying to survive a man determined to have her and he doesn't care what it takes to get there. In this slow burn battle of wills, Charlotte tries her best to retain her fighting spirit, while he doubles down on his resolve to own her, mind, body, and soul. But not everything is as it seems in this tale of hurt, fear and betrayal. In the end, will her captor be able to set aside his quest for vengeance if that's what it takes to keep Charlotte? Will Charlotte be able to move past the continually cascading domino effect that is constantly leaving her life in absolute upheaval? Will they make their decisions before the past catches up and makes the decision for them?

I am on a short hiatus, but will be back in the fall with Act 2. I don't know what the bath scene is like in the book you referenced, but I think my story might check that box for you. No poly, no cheating. Sort of Mafia. Organized Crime for sure. It is Defiance by An0neemouse (me) on Ao3 HEA, MF dark romance, Organized crime, Very controlling MMC, Very feisty MFC Charlotte is successful, single, and happy. If she's a little lonely, well, that's fine, that's what friends are for. On an out of state visit to her parents, she arrives just in time to disrupt a handsome stranger's plan to kill her parents, though why he'd want to in the first place, she cannot fathom. Instead he makes a demand for an exorbitant amount of money and to make sure he gets his money, he takes Charlotte as collateral... collateral he has no intention of keeping his hands off of. Charlotte is thrown into a world she knows nothing about, trying to survive a man determined to have her and he doesn't care what it takes to get there. In this slow burn battle of wills, Charlotte tries her best to retain her fighting spirit, while he doubles down on his resolve to own her, mind, body, and soul. But not everything is as it seems in this tale of hurt, fear and betrayal. In the end, will her captor be able to set aside his quest for vengeance if that's what it takes to keep Charlotte? Will Charlotte be able to move past the continually cascading domino effect that is constantly leaving her life in absolute upheaval? Will they make their decisions before the past catches up and makes the decision for them? [ ""In retrospect, spitting in his face was probably a mistake. He had let out a sound somewhere between a cat throwing up and tiger snarling and then next thing I knew there was a hand on my throat, my eyes bulging out of my skull, and then– nothing.

mov_EE5637647AFF610EC6F502CD8FEB6169,"  The secret to the U.S. Marine Corps' success is a blending of bedrock principles with innovation, the commander of U.S. Central Command said here last night. Using two examples from recent history -- the heroism of the last Marine Medal of Honor recipient and the turnaround in Iraq's Anbar province, -- Army Gen. David H. Petraeus shared his view at an event hosted by the Marine Association Foundation. “On the one hand, Marines display a stalwart resistance to change in those bedrock values that form the very foundation of what it means to be Marine,” he said. “On the other hand, Marines demonstrate a ready embrace of innovation that allows them to adapt to the environments in which they operate and to the enemies they face.” Some of those timeless, unchanging truths that describe the Marine Corps include an unflinching devotion to one's fellow Marines, a ready embrace of hardship and a universal emphasis on the skills and the spirit of the rifleman, he said. Petraeus said these underlying principles are illustrated in the story of Marine Corps Cpl. Jason Dunham. In 2004, the 22-year-old Marine was killed in action in Karabilah, Iraq, when he used his body to cover a grenade and shield his fellow Marines from the ensuing blast. Dunham became the 295th Marine to receive the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military decoration, which is bestowed for gallantry in action. The Navy will christen a ship named in the fallen Marine's honor -- the USS Jason Dunham -- next week during a ceremony at Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine. Petraeus said the Marines' actions in Anbar province illustrate their ability to adapt their strategy to meet unique challenges. In 2006, Anbar province was one of Iraq's most contentious regions. It was a society that had collapsed under the weight of an endemic insurgency with an infrastructure dilapidated by years of infighting and neglect. But amid the surge of U.S. forces in 2007, al-Qaida operatives overplayed their hands in Anbar, alienating local residents. Meanwhile, the influx of U.S. Marines helped to tamp down violence and create political breathing room, which in turn allowed the forging of key alliances between local tribal sheiks and coalition operators. “As a result, sheiks started coming forward to coalition forces to discuss an alliance to throw off al-Qaida,” Petraeus said. “And this was the opening we needed.” The “Anbar Awakening,” a societal purging of extremism by Anbaris, and formation of a civilian security group known as “Sons of Iraq” ushered in a level of stability unprecedented since U.S. operations in Iraq began. “It is not an exaggeration to say that the Anbar Awakening helped alter the course of events in Iraq,” Petraeus said. “And I believe that generations from now, historians will continue to view it as a great example of the principled application of long-standing counterinsurgency principles.” Story by John J.

mov_24E0EF63EE74B59966352B8C0D7B72BE,"  Chapter 87 Art in Alchemy: Visual Communication of Symbols Until the 1980s, alchemists were considered pseudo-scientists, and their efforts to transmute base metals into gold were described as futile. However, at the end of the 20th century, by deciphering the complicated alchemical texts, some researchers came to believe that the alchemists had in fact made a significant contribution to the development of science. Alchemical texts have been obscured, by secrecy, as alchemists deliberately described their experiences in metaphorical terms derived from mythology and history. For example, the text that describes a ""cold dragon"" that ""goes in and out of caves"" was the code for saltpeter (potassium nitrate) - a crystalline substance found on cave walls that tastes cool on the tongue. Lawrence Principe, a chemist and historian of science at Johns Hopkins University, concocted some obscure texts of 17th-century lab notebooks to piece together a recipe for growing a ""philosophers tree"". Supposedly, this tree was a precursor to the more famous and elusive Philosopher's Stone, which is said to be able to transmute metals into gold. By mixing specially prepared mercury and gold in a buttery form at the bottom of a vial and burying the sealed vial in a heated sand bath in his laboratory, Principe discovered that the vial was filled with ""a. sparkling and fully formed golden tree "". The mixture of metals had grown upward to form a coral-like structure or the branching canopy of a tree without the leaves. This was part of a growing evidence that alchemists seem to have performed legitimate experiments, manipulated and analyzed the material world in interesting ways, and reported genuine results. Alchemical image of the Divine Sophia as a Tree of Learning and source of the Elixir of Life. As such, she was known to alchemists as Sapientia, Lady Wisdom, Lady Nature, Alkimia. The multi-walled enclosure around her may suggest the multi-banded cosmos of the archons. Metaphorically, it represents the alcove of learning, then the exoteric, mesoteric, and esoteric chambers of divine instruction. From many  20th century discoveries of Sassanian  silver vessels that are now placed in various museums, we can identify this goddess as Ardvi Sura Anahita,  from  the pantheon of the  ancient  Iranian religion of Mitra. She was a mother and fertility goddess, who as the goddess of the water of life, presenting all living beings to drink the life-giving water of the haoma, the Elixir of Life, which flowed  forth from the tree of life. According to Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin,, in his La Religion de l'Iran Ancien, Les Anciens Religions Orientales IIIr:""The haoma is not only a plant and a liquor, it is also a god: for him  are sacrifices made, and certain parts of the sacrificial victim were reserved for him. Being a god, one kills him by pressing him. The brahmanas say the same thing of Soma. "" We can also see the image of Anahita, on the stone relief  at Taq-i Bustan,  giving  the princely  diadem  to King Pirooz I. As well, on the stone relief at Naqsh-i Rustam, where Anahita  presents King Narse  with the Farreh-Izadi, the divine symbol of his sovereign power on the occasion of his investiture. The work of art in Alchemy literature, using wide-ranging symbolism, methaphorical concepts, and surreal legends to express the association of chemical and physical concepts with esoteric and mystic ones constitutes a fascinating genre of visual communication design. At its core exhibiting a very fine balance between metaphysical aspects of life and reality of the chemical processes, which not only invites  viewers to explore spiritual processes, but also suggests , most often fraudulent and sometimes genuine, efforts  to resolve some actual scientific challenges to transmute a base metal into gold or to find a substance that could eradicate death and provide immortality. Many Europeans consider the Persian prophet Zoraster as the ""inventor"" of both magic and astrology. However, in the Hellenic heritage, Zoaraster was the ""prophet and founder of the religion of the Iranian peoples"" (e.g. Plutarch Isis and Osiris 46-7, Diogenes Laertius 1.6-9 and Agathias 2.23-5), ""the rest was mostly fantasy."" He was assumed of belonging to a deeply- ancient past, six or seven millennia BC, and was presented as a sovereign of Bactria, or a cobbler (or a teacher) living on the shores of Babylon. Similar to the ancient Rig Veda that contains hundreds of verses concerning soma, how to press and sieve plants, how to store it and drink it, in order to release its exhilarating and intoxicating effect, Zoroasterin literature is partial to huoma, one of the two trees in the original garden of paradise, a tree with the gift of immortality. Zoroaster, riding on the back of a fire-breathing salamander,  with three roses in his hand representing body, soul and spirit. 18th century alchemical manuscript - Clavis Artis. Biblioteca dell'Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Roma, vol. 1. Deriving from the alchemical practice and its symbolism, underpinned by an extensive literature rooted in  four papyrus rolls of the Asteroskopita (or Apotelesmatika) dealing with astrology or one lost papytus roll of Peri lithon timion (On Virtue of Stones) among other of alleged books of Zoroaster, including his  lost works that appear in many fragments in the works of others, that circulated the Mediterranean world (from the 3rd century BC), he was perceived as the founder the magi and of their magic arts. As well, Zoroaster's patron King Hystaspes and his disciple Ostanes who was described by the 4th century BC Hermodorus (apud Diogenes Laertius Prooemium ) as being a magus in the long line of magi descending from Zoroaster, were considered as practitioner of “magic” – Greek magikos. Pliny the Elder named Zoroaster as the inventor of magic, but that Ostanes was the first writer of it (Natural History 30.2.3, the 1st-century). ""This Ostanes,"" so Pliny reports, was a Persian magus, who had accompanied Xerxes in his invasion of Greece, and who had then introduced magicis the “ the most fraudulent of the arts, ” to that country. According to Pliny, Ostanes ' introduction of the “monstrous craft” to the Greeks gave those people not only a “lust” ( aviditatem) for magic, but downright “madness” (rabiem ), and many of their philosophers, such as Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, and Plato traveled abroad to study it and then returned to teach it. (xxx.2.8-10). Pliny also transmits Ostanes' definition of magic: “As Ostanes said, there are several different kinds of it: he professes to divine ( divina promittit) from water, globes, air, stars, lamps, basins, and axis, and by many other methods. And besides to converse with ghosts and those in the underworld” (XXX.2.8.-10). By the end of 1st century AD Ostanes is cited as an authority on alchemy, necromancy, divination, and on the mystical properties of plants and stones. Both his legend and literary output attributed to him increased with time, and by the 4th century he had become one of the great authorities in alchemy. The 18th century occultist Francis Barrett wrote of the influence of Zoroaster on the great and noble art of alchemy, in the clearest of terms: Alchymy, the grand touchstone of natural wisdom, is of divine origin: it was brought down from Heaven by the Angel Uriel. Zoroaster, the first philosopher by fire, made pure gold from all seven metals; he brought the sun ten times brighter from the bed of Saturn, and fixed it with the moon, who thereby copulating, begot numerous offspring of an immortal nature, a pure living spiritual sun, burning in the refulgency of its own...","Chapter 87 Art in Alchemy: Visual Communication of Symbols Until the 1980s, alchemists were considered pseudo-scientists, and their efforts to transmute base metals into gold were described as futile. However, at the end of the 20th century, by deciphering the complicated alchemical texts, some researchers came to believe that the alchemists had in fact made a significant contribution to the development of science. Alchemical texts have been obscured, by secrecy, as alchemists deliberately described their experiences in metaphorical terms derived from mythology and history. For example, the text that describes a ""cold dragon"" that ""goes in and out of caves"" was the code for saltpeter (potassium nitrate) - a crystalline substance found on cave walls that tastes cool on the tongue. Lawrence Principe, a chemist and historian of science at Johns Hopkins University, concocted some obscure texts of 17th-century lab notebooks to piece together a recipe for growing a ""philosophers tree"". Supposedly, this tree was a precursor to the more famous and elusive Philosopher's Stone, which is said to be able to transmute metals into gold. By mixing specially prepared mercury and gold in a buttery form at the bottom of a vial and burying the sealed vial in a heated sand bath in his laboratory, Principe discovered that the vial was filled with ""a. sparkling and fully formed golden tree "". The mixture of metals had grown upward to form a coral-like structure or the branching canopy of a tree without the leaves. This was part of a growing evidence that alchemists seem to have performed legitimate experiments, manipulated and analyzed the material world in interesting ways, and reported genuine results. Alchemical image of the Divine Sophia as a Tree of Learning and source of the Elixir of Life. As such, she was known to alchemists as Sapientia, Lady Wisdom, Lady Nature, Alkimia. The multi-walled enclosure around her may suggest the multi-banded cosmos of the archons. Metaphorically, it represents the alcove of learning, then the exoteric, mesoteric, and esoteric chambers of divine instruction. From many 20th century discoveries of Sassanian silver vessels that are now placed in various museums, we can identify this goddess as Ardvi Sura Anahita, from the pantheon of the ancient Iranian religion of Mitra. She was a mother and fertility goddess, who as the goddess of the water of life, presenting all living beings to drink the life-giving water of the haoma, the Elixir of Life, which flowed forth from the tree of life. According to Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin,, in his La Religion de l'Iran Ancien, Les Anciens Religions Orientales IIIr:""The haoma is not only a plant and a liquor, it is also a god: for him are sacrifices made, and certain parts of the sacrificial victim were reserved for him. Being a god, one kills him by pressing him. The brahmanas say the same thing of Soma. "" We can also see the image of Anahita, on the stone relief at Taq-i Bustan, giving the princely diadem to King Pirooz I. As well, on the stone relief at Naqsh-i Rustam, where Anahita presents King Narse with the Farreh-Izadi, the divine symbol of his sovereign power on the occasion of his investiture. The work of art in Alchemy literature, using wide-ranging symbolism, methaphorical concepts, and surreal legends to express the association of chemical and physical concepts with esoteric and mystic ones constitutes a fascinating genre of visual communication design. At its core exhibiting a very fine balance between metaphysical aspects of life and reality of the chemical processes, which not only invites viewers to explore spiritual processes, but also suggests , most often fraudulent and sometimes genuine, efforts to resolve some actual scientific challenges to transmute a base metal into gold or to find a substance that could eradicate death and provide immortality. Many Europeans consider the Persian prophet Zoraster as the ""inventor"" of both magic and astrology. However, in the Hellenic heritage, Zoaraster was the ""prophet and founder of the religion of the Iranian peoples"" (e.g. Plutarch Isis and Osiris 46-7, Diogenes Laertius 1.6-9 and Agathias 2.23-5), ""the rest was mostly fantasy."" He was assumed of belonging to a deeply- ancient past, six or seven millennia BC, and was presented as a sovereign of Bactria, or a cobbler (or a teacher) living on the shores of Babylon. Similar to the ancient Rig Veda that contains hundreds of verses concerning soma, how to press and sieve plants, how to store it and drink it, in order to release its exhilarating and intoxicating effect, Zoroasterin literature is partial to huoma, one of the two trees in the original garden of paradise, a tree with the gift of immortality. Zoroaster, riding on the back of a fire-breathing salamander, with three roses in his hand representing body, soul and spirit. 18th century alchemical manuscript - Clavis Artis. Biblioteca dell'Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Roma, vol. 1. Deriving from the alchemical practice and its symbolism, underpinned by an extensive literature rooted in four papyrus rolls of the Asteroskopita (or Apotelesmatika) dealing with astrology or one lost papytus roll of Peri lithon timion (On Virtue of Stones) among other of alleged books of Zoroaster, including his lost works that appear in many fragments in the works of others, that circulated the Mediterranean world (from the 3rd century BC), he was perceived as the founder the magi and of their magic arts. As well, Zoroaster's patron King Hystaspes and his disciple Ostanes who was described by the 4th century BC Hermodorus (apud Diogenes Laertius Prooemium ) as being a magus in the long line of magi descending from Zoroaster, were considered as practitioner of “magic” – Greek magikos. Pliny the Elder named Zoroaster as the inventor of magic, but that Ostanes was the first writer of it (Natural History 30.2.3, the 1st-century). ""This Ostanes,"" so Pliny reports, was a Persian magus, who had accompanied Xerxes in his invasion of Greece, and who had then introduced magicis the “ the most fraudulent of the arts, ” to that country. According to Pliny, Ostanes ' introduction of the “monstrous craft” to the Greeks gave those people not only a “lust” ( aviditatem) for magic, but downright “madness” (rabiem ), and many of their philosophers, such as Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, and Plato traveled abroad to study it and then returned to teach it. (xxx.2.8-10). Pliny also transmits Ostanes' definition of magic: “As Ostanes said, there are several different kinds of it: he professes to divine ( divina promittit) from water, globes, air, stars, lamps, basins, and axis, and by many other methods. And besides to converse with ghosts and those in the underworld” (XXX.2.8.-10). By the end of 1st century AD Ostanes is cited as an authority on alchemy, necromancy, divination, and on the mystical properties of plants and stones. Both his legend and literary output attributed to him increased with time, and by the 4th century he had become one of the great authorities in alchemy.

n1ifozf,"  Back with another set of reviews! My workplace is very dead today, so I've been enjoying reminiscing on my product purchases and reviewing them. I know most of these can't be purchased now, but I hope this is fun anyway! *Hello Kitty shower gel* - I really wasn't sure about ordering this one! I'm a little done with Snow Fairy products, although I do generally like the scent profile. But I caved, and I'm not sorry! It's a fabulous, lighter take on Snow Fairy. The sweet milky notes of Milky Bath and SF are there, but the addition of the strawberry and orange oil makes it fresh. I almost get hints of cantaloupe?? It's an amazing scent for summer. Syrupy but not cloying. I've been reaching for this a lot. *Bitzer body balm* - Like everybody else on earth, I beg Lush to make this a permanent product. Not just the scent, which is totally Hi-Chew candy and DELICIOUS, but the product itself. By far the best body balm I've used. The mango oil was soooo hydrating and thicc (in a good way). I loved the shape and size. I'm SO sorry I only purchased one. It was such a bright spot in my shower routine. *The Old Songs Are Waking body scrub* - This product is so aptly named. My mom made fun of it being nonsensical, but I GET it! This awoke things in me. I consider this to be a classic Lush scent alongside the likes of Supermilk, LoM, Turmeric Latte, Posh Choc & Rose etc. in that it is so unique and layered that you'll not find anything similar elsewhere. Before purchasing, I'd read a lot about the powdery/clean laundry notes, which scared me as I'm not big on that. And those notes are there, to be sure, but they WORK. They work so beautifully with the light, fruity sorbet scents it's unreal. I get just a hint of clean vanilla, the pink peppercorn notes, and a wonderful mix of bergamot and berry. This is my scent. I want to live in it & be known for it. My regret at not purchasing the body spray last year haunts me daily. If anybody is looking to offload one in Canada, hit. me. UP. This is also undoubtedly my favourite scrub I've used, texture-wise. The coconut oil and fine castor sugar are extremely smooth and moisturizing. I use it as a gentle exfoliant and them just shave with the leftover oils. It's a great two-in-one. *Happy Skin enzyme exfoliator* - I'm a sucker for gimmicks, OK? Not saying this product is a gimmick, but the idea of the bromelain enzymes in the pineapple/jackfruit breaking down my dead skin just makes sense to me, and I love the concept. I mean, pineapple surely eats tf out of my tongue and gums while I'm eating it lol! Overall, this is not life changing product, but it's definitely a lovely gentle mechanical and chemical exfoliant that I'm happy to have in my routine. I use it about 3x weekly after washing my face with the Turmeric Roll cleanser and let it sit on my face for a few minutes while I wash my body. I feel a little brighter afterward and it gets my dry bits off my nose. Because of the fine nut/bamboo powder, I do skip this one on days where my skin feels more sensitive. I'll typically use the Cosmetic Warrior mask instead on those days. *Naughty Pigs shower jelly* - This was such a delight to open, lol. Totally impractical and now a couple months later it's shredded to teeny jelly bits, but I don't care because the pigs were so cute. I know nothing about Shaun the Sheep; I'm just here for the concept and scent! I know the sand sprinkled throughout turned some people off and it does absolutely nothing, but I don't care because it's so on theme and I loved it. I'm glad Lush still adds those little details....","Back with another set of reviews! My workplace is very dead today, so I've been enjoying reminiscing on my product purchases and reviewing them. I know most of these can't be purchased now, but I hope this is fun anyway! *Hello Kitty shower gel* - I really wasn't sure about ordering this one! I'm a little done with Snow Fairy products, although I do generally like the scent profile. But I caved, and I'm not sorry! It's a fabulous, lighter take on Snow Fairy. The sweet milky notes of Milky Bath and SF are there, but the addition of the strawberry and orange oil makes it fresh. I almost get hints of cantaloupe?? It's an amazing scent for summer. Syrupy but not cloying. I've been reaching for this a lot. *Bitzer body balm* - Like everybody else on earth, I beg Lush to make this a permanent product. Not just the scent, which is totally Hi-Chew candy and DELICIOUS, but the product itself. By far the best body balm I've used. The mango oil was soooo hydrating and thicc (in a good way). I loved the shape and size. I'm SO sorry I only purchased one. It was such a bright spot in my shower routine. *The Old Songs Are Waking body scrub* - This product is so aptly named. My mom made fun of it being nonsensical, but I GET it! This awoke things in me. I consider this to be a classic Lush scent alongside the likes of Supermilk, LoM, Turmeric Latte, Posh Choc & Rose etc. in that it is so unique and layered that you'll not find anything similar elsewhere. Before purchasing, I'd read a lot about the powdery/clean laundry notes, which scared me as I'm not big on that. And those notes are there, to be sure, but they WORK. They work so beautifully with the light, fruity sorbet scents it's unreal. I get just a hint of clean vanilla, the pink peppercorn notes, and a wonderful mix of bergamot and berry. This is my scent. I want to live in it & be known for it. My regret at not purchasing the body spray last year haunts me daily. If anybody is looking to offload one in Canada, hit. me. UP. This is also undoubtedly my favourite scrub I've used, texture-wise. The coconut oil and fine castor sugar are extremely smooth and moisturizing. I use it as a gentle exfoliant and them just shave with the leftover oils. It's a great two-in-one. *Happy Skin enzyme exfoliator* - I'm a sucker for gimmicks, OK? Not saying this product is a gimmick, but the idea of the bromelain enzymes in the pineapple/jackfruit breaking down my dead skin just makes sense to me, and I love the concept. I mean, pineapple surely eats tf out of my tongue and gums while I'm eating it lol! Overall, this is not life changing product, but it's definitely a lovely gentle mechanical and chemical exfoliant that I'm happy to have in my routine. I use it about 3x weekly after washing my face with the Turmeric Roll cleanser and let it sit on my face for a few minutes while I wash my body. I feel a little brighter afterward and it gets my dry bits off my nose. Because of the fine nut/bamboo powder, I do skip this one on days where my skin feels more sensitive. I'll typically use the Cosmetic Warrior mask instead on those days. *Naughty Pigs shower jelly* - This was such a delight to open, lol. Totally impractical and now a couple months later it's shredded to teeny jelly bits, but I don't care because the pigs were so cute. I know nothing about Shaun the Sheep; I'm just here for the concept and scent! I know the sand sprinkled throughout turned some people off and it does absolutely nothing, but I don't care because it's so on theme and I loved it. I'm glad Lush still adds those little details....",2025-07-05 18:41:53,en,REDDIT,,,,,1,False,False,"The entire review is about Lush products and does not mention Bath & Body Works at all.

n1m18di,"  I used to work in retail- most stores have really good return policies. Companies want to please the customer. They want you to come back and keep spending your money. Most places will usually take anything back- usually for full price or for a reduced price depending on different factors. The process is also usually pretty easy and hassle free. If you're ever having issues at a particular location/with an associate, they're just being difficult for no reason. Go to another location, on a different day, or try CS online. If you're ever worried about a return, look up the return policy online. An example store would be Ulta: I usually try to keep my box and receipt, because I'm anxious and want to make the process as smooth as possible. They honestly don't really need anything. When you go in they will ask if you have a receipt. If you don't, they can look up the purchase on your account with phone number. They may ask you how much was used or a reason for returning- sometimes they don't. They'll scan it and return the money. The process literally takes less than 5 minutes. Another example is Amazon: You can start the return in the app and return it to your local Kohls. You do 90% of it online. Take the QR code to the return desk and they will scan it and take it. No questions asked. When I worked at Bath and Body Works our return policy was 100% guarantee. This was back 2019-2021, so the policy has definitely changed. At the time you could literally return anything. It could be fully used or 1 year old- we had to take it. I saw your comment about it being an inconvenience, but it's not any weight on the employee. It's just another “transaction”. They would come in with their item. I would ask the reasoning because the system wants to know- I genuinely didn't care. I was just asking so I could press a button. If it was an item we still had in stock, the customer would get a full refund. If it was an old item that was no longer sold, I would grab a correlating item in one of the core collections and use that bar code. You would get back what the price of that was, even if it wasn't what you paid. If they wanted to exchange items, it would be a 1 for 1 thing. If you spent $49.95, you would go get your items totaling to $49.95. After the transaction was done, I would just toss the items on a shelf in the back.

Entry is off Crown street (quite busy) or via rear entry of Crown Lane. Premises are clean and newly refurbished. Gent on reception was polite and after fixing finances was asked to take a seat as she got the room ready. After a few minutes I was invited down to room 8. Room was large, reasonably well lit with bed, spa, ensuite and what looked like a huge walk-in shower. The best part about the room was the goddess standing inside in tall black boots, lingerie and a button down shirt fully open. Hubba da hubba. If you are after an Asian waif, Chase is not for you. She is more Amazon warrior with a lean muscular body and flowing black hair. It was definitely a good selection. Body is tanned, but obviously keeps covered up when on the beach as her bikini line is apparent both around her breasts and pussy. All in all, a wondrous sight to behold After we both got undressed and stepped into the spa bath for a quick wash down with the hand-held shower. Looking down at this vision of beauty, squatting down and gently cleaning my cock, I was in heaven. After a quick shower and mouthwash it was time to adopt the position face down on the bed, that had a waterproof covering and towel on top. I've had a few massages but this was my first Nuru. The gel had been warmed up and after some gentle massaging Chase got down to business rubbing her body against mine. It must have been a couple of days since she last shaved/waxed her pussy as they was a little regrowth but the combination of the slippery gel with the stubble felt electric. A bit of TT and neck kisses and then it was time to flip over and I got to really enjoy her body. She is advertised as C-cup and whilst I'm no expert I would have probably sized them more as B-cups. That being said, her nipples were very responsive to the touch and felt great suckling on them, which she seemed to enjoy. Chase rubbed herself all over me, using not only her hands, but legs and feet as well. Some light kissing was allowed. She had been chatty on and off up until this point and she soon had her mouth full sucking my cock (covered). The sight of her bobbing up and down took a huge amount of willpower not to blow there and then. She has sultry eyes that really do say 'Come fuck me' (on the cards for next time). CBJ was great with good suction, tongue action and no teeth. I held on for what felt like eternity and then let go into the bag. She slid up and cuddled, more kissing and some general chit chat. Before long the first buzzer went off, so it was back into the spa bath for another shower to wash the gel off and I got admire that body again.

mov_AEFB248551A03D17FC51A9B3597B02CE,"  A sense of déjà vu permeates the latest report on brand trust. Morning Consult's 2025 Most Reputable Brands analysis reveals that the companies consumers rely on most today bear a striking resemblance to those favored during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. This resurgence of trust in established brands underscores a continued prioritization of safety, security, and essential needs, even as the world navigates a new normal. The report, which surveyed consumers across all demographics, highlights a consistent preference for brands associated with cleanliness, health, and reliable service. But what does this sustained loyalty tell us about the evolving consumer mindset and the enduring power of established brands in a rapidly changing world? Across all consumer touchpoints, a handful of categories consistently emerged as leaders in brand trust. These include: Home Keeping and Hygiene: Brands like Dawn, Clorox, Lysol, Mr. Clean, and Home Depot continue to be cornerstones of consumer confidence. Self- and Personal Care: Dove, Oral-B, Kleenex, and Colgate remain trusted staples in daily routines. Health: BAND-AID and Tylenol exemplify the enduring trust in brands providing essential healthcare solutions. Packages and Shipping/Ecommerce: UPS, Amazon, the United States Postal Service, and FedEx are vital for modern commerce and maintain high levels of consumer trust. And, let's not forget the comfort factor: Hershey's and M&M's demonstrate that even indulgence can be a source of reliable satisfaction. Maslow's Hierarchy and the Modern Consumer These favored brands directly address fundamental human needs, as outlined in Maslow's Hierarchy. From physiological needs (food, hygiene) to safety and security, consumers are gravitating towards brands that provide a sense of stability and well-being. This isn't simply nostalgia; it's a reflection of ongoing anxieties and a desire for predictability in an uncertain world. Deeper Dive: Trust Across Specific Verticals Morning Consult's analysis extended beyond broad categories, examining trust within specific consumer verticals.

Younger consumers, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, demonstrate a growing trust in social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube, while older generations tend to favor legacy brands with established reputations. This generational gap highlights the evolving role of media and marketing in shaping consumer perceptions. Adweek's analysis provides further insight into these differing perspectives. Pro Tip: Building brand trust requires consistent delivery on promises, transparent communication, and a genuine commitment to customer well-being. The Rise of Health and Sustainability Concerns Recent data from the dunnhumby Consumer Trends Tracker reinforces the growing importance of health and sustainability for U.S. consumers. Two-thirds of consumers prioritize sourcing products that align with their dietary needs, and nearly half believe retailers should actively support healthy choices. This trend extends to a preference for local businesses and products, driven by a desire for transparency and connection. As the 2025 Edelman Trust Barometer demonstrates, trust is increasingly built through local relationships rather than distant national brands. However, economic realities are also impacting consumer behavior. With potential cuts to SNAP benefits and rising food costs, one in four U.S. households, and over a third of those aged 18-34, have been forced to skip meals in the past year. This underscores the critical role of food security and the need for accessible, affordable nutrition. The growing movement towards “food as medicine” is gaining traction, recognizing that food is not merely sustenance but a fundamental component of health and well-being....","A sense of déjà vu permeates the latest report on brand trust.

n1tp9t5,"  Carlos didn't jump off the cliff in his flesh body! Re-read it...  Remember how don Genaro was teasing him about pooping from fright, up at the top? At the same time he was jumping... It's pretty common to do what you read there. Defy gravity. Instead of a cliff, you can simply swipe the ceiling away and jump outside the galaxy. It even hurts when you land on a planet in a galaxy far, far away. Seemingly in your physical body, and completely sober, eyes wide open, moving around. Or you can go chasing a witch who visits while you practice, leaping around over the trees like a cheesy Kungfu movie. Cholita taunts me to chase after her once in a while, but she's in her double, while I'm in my (old) flesh body, so keeping up is impossible. You don't understand what was going on in the books because you didn't read carefully, so the only jumping you're doing is to false conclusions. It's not even a difficult technique, if you practice ""darkroom"". Which is merely tensegrity done in darkness, to make ""*seeing*"" easier. Now, the last time when Carlos jumped off the cliff, as don Juan left the world,  he ALSO DIDN'T  jump in his physical body! He jumped by shrinking the tonal, like the story ""Shrinking the Tonal"" in ""Tales of Power"", where Carlos was shoved 1 mile away by don Juan, and several days into the past or future. And then walked home from there. Later he discovered, he couldn't possibly have been pushed there because the coin stands weren't open. He was pushed into a dream version. Common...  If you actually do some work. When Carlos jumped off the cliff after don Juan left, he still didn't jump in his physical body. He simply ""woke up"" in his apartment in Los Angeles, 2 days travel away, in just a half hour or so. Likely don Juan helped him wake up there. Just like when he woke up in Arizona, having gone to sleep in Mexico, at which point Carol Tiggs had to plunge him into a cold bath to keep him from dying of fright.

Blame it on the huge selection, speedy shipping, and simple return process, but let's just say I put my Prime account to good use—especially when it comes to beauty products. Whether it's a TikTok-viral lip stain or a cult-classic Korean essence, I've placed more orders in the last year than I'd like to admit. At the time, it was bad news for my bank account, but now, it's good news for you because I know which Amazon beauty products are actually worth ordering, and right in time for Prime Day, too. This year, Prime Day deals are happening from July 8 to 11. During the sale, Prime members can score big discounts on thousands of products, including the best of the beauty category. Excited? Me too. Keep scrolling to see my official, beauty editor–approved shopping guide. Wonderskin Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain - Adore I have to start with a product I use almost every single day—Wonderskin's Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain. It went viral on TikTok a few months ago, and once I tested it, I could see why. Apply the dark-blue liquid to the lips (don't worry—it doesn't stay that way), wait a few minutes to let it dry, and peel it off. You'll be left with the most stunning, long-lasting lip color. You can stop there, or you can apply lip gloss over the top. I prefer the latter. It's become my go-to lip combo. Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water I can't tell you how many makeup artists and skincare experts have recommended Bioderma's Sensibio H2O Micellar Water to me. The classic French pharmacy product quickly and easily dissolves makeup, cleansing the skin without leaving behind even a hint of redness or irritation. Bondi Sands Self Tanning Foam Behold! The only self-tanner I've used consistently for over five years—Bondi Sands' Self Tanning Foam in Dark. It doesn't streak. It doesn't smell. It also features a bronze guide color, allowing you to see exactly where you're placing it and where you need to blend. I wear it overnight, and by the next morning, I have natural-looking, sun-kissed limbs. COLOR WOW Dream Coat Supernatural Spray I've always wondered how celebrities like Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian get such glossy hair on the red carpet. Well, as it turns out, the answer is Color Wow's Dream Coat Supernatural Spray. Read my full review to learn why it's such an underrated gem. COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence Snail mucin is the ultimate glass-skin ingredient. It's moisturizing, antioxidant-rich, and anti-inflammatory, so no wonder this iconic snail mucin essence blew up on the internet. It's the key to firm, bouncy, dewy skin. Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey Clinique's Almost Lipstick in Black Honey is so good. It was *the* lipstick for '90s starlets and supermodels. Everyone from Drew Barrymore to Courteney Cox and Julia Roberts wore it in the decade of slip dresses, grunge music, and mood rings. Cut to modern day, and it's still as beloved as ever.

Amazon Prime Day, aka the biggest sale of the year so far, is officially here. Prime members have four days (yes, four) to shop exclusive discounts across categories, including tech, beauty, home and kitchen, plus take advantage of limited-time promotions like Lightning Deals. And while hundreds of deals are available to shop right now, they're not all worthwhile — in fact, most aren't. As shopping editors, we get an advanced preview of the deals, so I spent the past few weeks combing through discounts to find the ones I think are actually worth adding to your cart. I've covered Prime Day for the past six years and in that time, I've perfected the deal hunting process. I look for items that are: 20% off or more, highly rated from hundreds of reviews and at its lowest price in at least three months. Every single deal I recommend below meets those qualifications, and I'll update this list live throughout Prime Day as more drop. Selected.Our top picks Out of all the teeth whitening strips we've tested, these are our favorite because they're easy to use and highly effective. Strips are coated in a layer of hydrogen peroxide to remove stains, and they're flexible, so they mold to the shape of your mouth.

Lowest Price Ever Track workouts, daily activity, sleep, health metrics like heart rate and more with this smartwatch. It's water-resistant, so you can swim with it, and it connects to your phone, letting you answer calls and texts. The watch's battery lasts for about 18 hours when it's fully charged, and 30 minutes in the included charger gives you about 80% battery, according to Apple. It's always a good idea to have extra batteries at home, especially to put in your emergency kit and power kids toys, remotes and flashlights. This pack comes with 32 AA alkaline batteries, which last up to 10 years if they're unused, according to the brand. This corded vacuum can clean dirt, pet hair and other messes on all floors in your home. It has a detachable pod and long nozzle, letting you clean hard-to-reach areas like above door frames, on stairs and under furniture. The vacuum is built with a HEPA filter to trap allergens like dust and pollen, and it comes with crevice and upholstery tools. LifeStraw's personal filter can remove over 99% of bacteria, parasites and microplastics from water, making it ideal to bring with you while camping or hiking, or pack in an emergency kit. The tool can filter up to 1,000 gallons of water before you need to replace it. It has a cap to protect the part you sip from, and a layard so you can put it around your neck. Lowest Price Ever The Dyson Airwrap simultaneously dries and styles your hair, letting you create curly, wavy and straight styles without causing heat damage, according to Dyson.

It's an over-the-counter retinoid made with 0.1% adapalene, and it works best if you apply it to your entire face once daily, according to the brand. The Little Green Machine helps you get stains out of upholstered furniture, carpets, area rugs, car seats and more.

This Kindle gives you 12 weeks of battery life on a single charge, according to the brand, and it's thin and lightweight, making it easy to travel with. It also has a 7-inch glare-free screen and an adjustable warm light so you can clearly see text in any environment. The e-reader is water-resistant, too — you can use it at the beach, by the pool or in the bath without worrying about splashes. “I'm a devoted hardcover fan, but I still can't live without my Kindle,” says NBC Select editor Lindsay Schneider, who's used a number of Kindle models over the years, courtesy testing samples from Amazon. “It really is impossible to live without once you try it. It makes it a whole lot easier to read on the go and outside. The battery is quite impressive too, I feel like I never have to charge it.” You'll wake up with smooth, moisturized lips when you leave this mask on overnight, says NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio. “I use Laneige's lip mask on days when my lips are super dry and it makes my nighttime routine so much more luxurious,” she says. “My lips feel so soft after I apply it, and I love using the little included spatula.” The lip mask is made with hydrating ingredients like vitamin C, murumuru seed and shea butters, antioxidants and coconut oil.

One way to lock in savings for the future is to take advantage of the numerous third party gift cards that Amazon has put on sale, with many brands available for 10%-20% off or more. That includes DoorDash, Instacart, Lowe's, Lyft, Sephora (indirectly) and more. The Deal   Save on select third party gift cards from Amazon. Direct link to offer (our affiliate link)   Key Terms   Various limits/denominations. Quick Thoughts   There are some great deals available today, but you'll have to check the details for each eligible brand's gift card as they're all different. For example, you can save $10 on $50 worth of Bath & Body Works gift cards, get $20 off $100 of Lyft gift cards, $15 off $100 of Lowe's gift cards, etc. Those are all straight discounts, but there are some deals offering Amazon promo credit that'll expire in the coming months, so you'll want to have a plan to redeem those credits. Also note that some of the deals are for eGift cards, while others are for physical gift cards that'll be shipped to you. There are a few One4All/Choice gift cards listed in there too which can be exchanged for many different brands. The One4All eGift Card is giving $10 off on $100 of spend and can be redeemed for a wide range of brands including Home Depot. The One4All/Choice Fun & Fabulous brand can be exchanged for gift cards for brands including Sephora, Nordstrom, Victoria's Secret and more. Be aware that you don't have to buy the specific denominations to get the discount. For example, if a deal gives $20 off a $100 gift card purchase, you don't necessarily have to buy a $100 gift card. You could instead buy two $50 gift cards, four $25 gift cards, etc. If you're buying for personal use then it might not be worth buying several smaller denominations, but if you want to buy some as gifts (e.g. by stocking up on stocking stuffers for December), buying several smaller denominations could come in handy. It looks like these aren't one-time only deals. Although you're limited to one discount per brand per order, it appears that you can get the discount again in a subsequent order. Just be sure to verify the discount is being correctly applied when checking out; it worked when quickly checking a brand I'd already bought just now, but some brands might have some kind of limit hardcoded. To take advantage of these deals you'll need a Prime subscription – adding them to your cart as a non-Prime member will result in no discount being applied. The good thing is that it's usually possible to get a 30 day free trial to Prime which means you can enroll for free now, then cancel before the 30 day trial is up if all you want to do is get Prime Day deals. Click here (our affiliate link) to see if you're targeted for the free trial. You can save even more on these gift card deals if you're targeted for one of the bank offers giving a discount on Amazon when using one or more of their points. For example, this Membership Rewards offer gives up to 40% off on up to $100 of spend. These types of deal are only valid on items shipped and sold by Amazon which these gift cards are. I bought $500 worth of gift cards earlier for $379.99 based on 15% and 20% discounts, as well as $40 off from that Membership Rewards deal, along with a $0.01 discount for redeeming one Membership Reward point.

The company is benefiting from industry-leading postpaid customer growth with a record-low churn rate. Its acquisition strategy has significantly strengthened its position in the wireless industry over the past few years. TMUS' 2.5 GHz 5G spectrum delivers superfast speeds and extensive coverage with signals that go through walls and trees. This boosts its competitive edge against companies that provide 5G networks controlled by the mmWave spectrum. However, owing to the stock's premium valuation, we believe investors should remain cautious as macroeconomic factors, market saturation, or economic downturns can significantly impact overvalued stocks like TMUS. Fierce competition is straining profitability. To lure customers from competitors, T-Mobile has launched several low-priced service plans for consumers. This has put pressure on profits.

The company's key drugs like Lynparza, Tagrisso, Imfinzi and Fasenra should keep driving revenues. Its pipeline is strong, with pivotal late- and mid-stage pipeline data readouts lined up. AstraZeneca has also been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline. AstraZeneca believes it can post industry-leading top-line growth in the 2025-2030 period. However, potentially lower sales of Lynparza and Farxiga in China, the impact of Part D redesign on U.S. oncology sales and slowing sales of rare disease drugs are expected to hurt the top line in 2025.

The company has been persistently suffering from video-subscriber attrition due to cord-cutting. Broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless and fiber businesses. Theme Parks revenues declined due to lower revenues at domestic theme parks, driven by lower guest attendance, including the impact of the Hollywood wildfires. A leveraged balance sheet is a major concern for Comcast. Nevertheless, steady growth in Content & Experiences revenues driven by steady performances by Studios and Media segments is positive.

With a high-resolution, glare-free and paper-like display plus an adjustable built-in light and a dark mode — this e-reader can be used day and night. Its 16 GB of storage is enough to store thousands of books (and . pdfs and documents), and with an added Kindle Unlimited subscription (free for the first three months if you make the selection), you can just pull those ebooks from the cloud. This small device is perfect for commuters, travelers who can't pack a ton of books or anyone looking to declutter their libraries. Scrub Daddy and Scrub Mommy 8-pack (20% off list price) Scrub Daddys and Scrub Mommys are beloved by cleaning enthusiasts, plus they come in fun colors. They stay firm in colder water for heavy-duty scrubbing and soften when exposed to warm water. You can even use them on stainless steel and cast iron, as they are scratch-free. Clean up after yourself without having to break a sweat thanks to these effective little dudes. This is the first time this pack is on sale during Prime Day and the lowest price of the year. Aquaphor itch relief ointment two-pack (30% off list price) Aquaphor's itch relief ointment for kids can be used on children ages two and up to soothe itchy patches of eczema, rashes, psoriasis and more. It's made with 1% hydrocortisone, and an absolute must as we approach the summer months, when insect bites abound and contact with poison ivy is a possibility.

The adjustable trolley handle has two height settings, while the interior compression pad system and organizer makes it easy to load up on clothing. It also comes with a water-repellent laundry bag.

Wet & Forget weekly shower cleaner (33% off list price) This super popular, low-maintenance shower cleaner promises to require no scrubbing at all — just spray it on scummy shower walls, let sit overnight and then rinse to get rid of built-up soap, grime, stains and body oils. It's bleach-free and safe for most surfaces, including glass, porcelain, sandstone and tile, though it's not recommended for use on natural marble. It's rarely on sale (we know; we've been tracking it) but today, you can get it for less than its usual $24 price tag. Clinique Almost Lipstick tinted lip balm (18% off list price) Beauty lovers know that this perfectly hued beauty product is the end-all be-all of lip balms. It's available in Black Honey and Pink Honey shades, though Black Honey is a cult-favorite lip color that is considered universally flattering and has been popular since the early aughts. This semi-glossy balm is perfect for everyday wear and rarely goes on sale. HEADS UP: This lip color is going like hot cakes right now so if you've been on the fence, now's the time to make a move.

n27fx94,"  Hey Pal, I think it's great you've come on here asking for help. That's the first step, right? You're actively doing something about this already. So I was exactly the same: I used to be a Chef and I would spend all of my time at work or out drinking with friends, especially during periods I didn't have a partner. I hated being alone. Then something really shit happened to my health after getting covid and I became chronically ill and then bedbound for a year and a half whilst navigating a horrible break up and family and friends leaving me because they didn't understand what was going on I wasnt well enough to watch TV, listen to audio books, even talk long enough for a proper conversation. I spent most of my time in a dark room with noise cancelling headphones and an eye mask on. I was FORCED to learn to be with myself to an extreme degree. It was like hell at the beginning, and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone (well, maybe Trump) ANYWAY this isn't meant to be a sob story or inspirational porn, but more passing on what I've learnt from that shit time to get to the point where I love spending time by myself now. I'm nowhere near recovered but I have a full life again with good friends and a lovely partner I met when I wasn't even looking for one. I spent years in therapy trying to find a way to be okay with being alone, to find that safe place inside myself. I thought it was an impossible goal, but now I can absolutely say I have gotten there. But it took time. The more time you spend with yourself, the easier it gets. It's all about forming a habit and normalising it, not setting expectations too high or punishing yourself for not being able to be consistent all the time. You need to have a lot of self compassion. For instance, dedicate some time each day to being alone with your thoughts. No distractions. You can be at home, sitting on a park bench, having a coffee, but no headphones or screen time. Think you can do an hour? Start off with half an hour. Or even 10 - 15 minutes to begin with if that's less scary. Plan something each week to just do for yourself: go see a film solo, a meal or coffee out, a super luxurious bath with salts and candles, a nice walk or meal with your favourite drink just because you can. Hey, you deserve it. If you can, try and do a meditation each day. Or just a couple of times a week to start. Factor it into your routine ie when you wake up. Even a 5 minute meditation is something. The Insight Timer app is free and has a lot of good ones. I recommend morning meditations, yoga nidra, self compassion ones, body scans etc. This will help you get used to just being present without having to do anything or be anything. It took me months of meditations and breathing exercises and stuff before I actually began to feel more comfortable inside my own head. I always rejected that kind of thing but holy fuck I'm annoyed at how much it works and I didn't know. Again though, it takes time. I'd also recommend reading bell hooks' book, All About Love. There's a GREAT quote in it that says “Knowing how to be solitary is central to the art of loving. When we can be alone, we can be with others without using them as a means of escape.” Also look into mindfulness exercises. They're really nice to do somewhere outside in nature too. Which is another thing, get out into nature when you can. With yourself or with friends. Go wild camping for a couple of days, swim in a lake/the sea, read in a park. Take food with you and plenty of water and just enjoy it. I know this all sounds a bit wishy washy but I can honestly tell you it saved my life. And I hope it can help you too. If you want an accountability buddy to encourage you to do these things I'm more than happy to help. It's not about trying to reach impossible standards, but just meeting yourself where you are and doing the best you can with what you have.","Hey Pal, I think it's great you've come on here asking for help.

mov_0522E96E139AA0522DFE3CA3CAC0934C,"  I've featured the 'City Tales' series of books from Oxford University Press on the blog a good number of times, and so I was very pleased to hear that they were bringing out an edition which focused on the city of Venice. If you've not come across these before, they feature short works or extracts based in or about a particular urban location, and they're always fascinating and beautifully presented. Venice is a place which always hypnotises, a city of beauty and decay, and the pieces in this volume certainly explore the setting from all angles. ""Venice Tales"" is compiled and edited by Katia Pizzi, with translations by Katherine Gregor and Howard Curtis; the series editor is Helen Constantine. The book opens with an earthy extract from Boccaccio's ""Decameron"" and already the contrast between the glory of the city and its more uncouth elements is on display, even at this early time of 1353! From 1787 comes an extract from the Italian memoirs of the playwright Goldoni; and the notorious Casanova is represented in a marvellous extract from ""The Story of My Life"" (1788) which recounts his daring escape from a Venice prison. I'd never considered reading his book, but was so taken with this piece that I may well have to explore it! We reject the Venice of foreigners, the market of antique forgers, magnet for universal snobbery, and imbecility, a bed collapsed under droves of lovers, a bejewelled hip bath for cosmopolitan courtesans, the greatest cesspit for passeism. (Marinetti) Not all of the pieces sing the praises of the city, however; and the futurist Marinetti launches into a manifesto against it from 1910, decrying the fact that it's so lost in the past and demanding a modernised, mechanised Venice - the mind rather boggles at the thought of that! Central to this volume, for me anyway, is an extract from one of my favourite books by one of my favourite writers - ""Invisible Cities"" by Italo Calvino (1972). Although the book is ostensibly not about Venice, but a vast array of cities described by the traveller Marco Polo, it nevertheless captures the elusive magic of the place from multiple angles. Truly, here all cities are Venice. Moving into the 21st century, this collection really comes into its own, gathering as it does a fascinating assortment of more modern pieces. These range from an extract from ""Venice is a Fish"" (Tiziano Scarpa; 2000) which explores the city in terms of the effect on your body parts to ""The Man Who Sleeps in Churches"" from 2007; this is a haunting story by Andrea Perin which features a protagonist who is pursued by the sound of bells and visions of collapsing bell towers. ""A Ghost in Venice"" (Guiseppe O. Longo; 2019) is an evocative piece which explores the emotions of a man who left his city, but returns in later life to an inherited property; in it, he confronts the man he might have become had he stayed. ""The Valleys of Venice"" (Giancarlo Gemin; 2022), which closes the book, is a moving look at the life of author's mother, an Venetian woman who moved to South Wales after WW2 to be with her husband who had gone there to work in the mines. She ended up in many ways caught between two cultures, never entirely comfortable in either, and this thoughtful piece reflects the situation of so many nowadays, displaced by wars and disputes. I have to highlight one particular entry in the collection which was hard-hitting for me. ""Venice is the Lagoon"" by Roberto Ferrucci (2015) is an eye opening piece revealing the damage which is being done to La Serenissima by tourism, in particular the hideously gigantic cruise ships which come into the lagoon. The environmental effects are horrific yet, despite regulations being put in place to prevent this, apparently the ships just keep on coming. Presumably, money trumps everything else... I was saddened by this story, as well as being reminded how uncomfortable I feel sometimes watching Susan Calman's programmes where she's off on massive cruisers. I may have to rethink my viewing habits a little. Those are some of the highlights of this collection, but really the whole book made absolutely fascinating reading; and it was particularly lovely to read Italian writers on the subject of Venice, as the place has inspired authors from all over the world. I *have* read dark tales about Venice (""Murder Most Serene"") as well as some glorious descriptions of the place (from Charles Dickens, particularly) and it's clear that both sides of the city are equally fascinating. ""Venice Tales"" is an wonderful anthology of works which highlight La Serenissima's dual nature and it makes excellent reading; it's a welcome addition to a fascinating series and highly recommended by me!

n2f23ng,"  That's a good question, but the answer is a little more complex. Everyone's pain threshold is different, and warts can behave very differently depending on their location. Some aren't painful at all, while others—especially plantar warts—can be extremely painful, particularly if they're near a nerve. It sounds like you might have one of the unlucky ones, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with having a lower tolerance for this specific type of pain—it can be sharp and persistent. That said, when treating at home, the most effective approach is to debride (shave down) the wart before applying acid. The goal is to get down to the living wart tissue, and you'll usually know you've reached it if you see a tiny pinpoint of bleeding—not a big drop, just a red dot. That's actually a good sign, though understandably unpleasant. If that level of pain is too much for you, I completely get it—it's not something everyone can tolerate. Just be aware that if you skip the debriding, the acid won't work as well and the treatment may drag on for months or even longer. If it's getting unmanageable, it's definitely worth considering a podiatrist. They have access to treatments that are often more effective. One example is cantharidin, commonly referred to as “Beetlejuice.” I want to be really clear about this: it is extremely painful—brutally so for many people. But it's also highly effective. In some cases, just one or two rounds can wipe out the wart completely. So while the treatment itself is very intense, it might be worth it compared to a year or more of slow, painful home treatments. At the end of the day, it's about what you can handle and what works best for you. There's no shame in choosing the path that minimizes your overall suffering. Have you seen my self treatment advice yet on this subreddit? I will paste it below just in case you have not. Pay particular attention to the linked video as it is a perfect demonstration of how to debride. Here's what you do: Start by getting a pedicure knife kit (reasonably cheap on Amazon and I don't see why it wouldn't work on different kinds of warts, not on the foot), eyebrow razors, and/or a scalpel. Do not file, buff, or exfoliate your wart with an emery board or pumice stone unless you want a constellation of mosaic warts all over your foot/area where your wart is. I also advise against using disposable files or sandpaper, as they too often result in inadvertently filing healthy skin along with the wart. This can lead to the introduction of wart cells to vulnerable exfoliated healthy skin, creating more warts. Also get some disposable gloves so they don't keep spreading as they are highly contagious. Daily- soak in hot water to soften the tissue, use the scalpel and knife kit to debride (search debride here if you are unsure what that means- it's like carefully shaving away the top dead layer) the wart ideally to the point of pin point bleeding if you can handle it (could be quite painful so listen to your body and do only what you are comfortable with). See the link below where a redditor uses an eyebrow razor and perfectly demonstrates how to debride. Debriding will help the acid to penetrate the living wart tissue making it more effective. Obviously, listen to your body. Some warts are far more painful than others. If it's too much to debride every day, it's ok. Also, make sure you aren't going overboard with how much you are debriding, it need not be a blood bath. Next,  apply treatment - I suggest either 40% SA like Wartstick or ACV, then bandage and wrap with duct tape to suffocate it. Do this every day if you can. This could take many months. Intermittently you can also use the over the counter wart freeze products to zap the warts (maybe once a week or two but be aware freeze products can be pricey). Also, supplements are a good idea- high quality multivitamin, Vit c, zinc, Vit A, and Tagamet (google it and then search “Tagamet and warts” on TikTok). Tagamet can be taken orally to help your body fight the wart and can also be used topically (watch the videos). Vitamin A can also be used topically (search this subreddit for more info). Most importantly- keep everything sterile and clean. Wash your hands a lot and keep warts wrapped, preferably with duct tape, so they don't spread more or cause your friends/family to get warts too. Please be aware that some warts are extremely treatment resistant and require more aggressive intervention others spread rapidly and aggressively. If you've been doing everything right for months with no improvement, it's time to make an appointment with a doctor (podiatrist if it's a plantar wart). Please be aware of your own body and any pre-existing conditions that could make the following treatment advice ill-advised for your body. https://www.reddit.com/r/Warts/s/7IWO3A85YE","That's a good question, but the answer is a little more complex.

1lx9zat,"  Just wanted to hop on here and share my story with scabies in order to help others possibly recover as well. I would like to note I am not a doctor. However, my girlfriend is in life science and we've done numerous readings on everything about scabies after our diagnosis. I recommend following a physicians advise. There are some very important things to understand about Scabies in general that i'll talk about first and then a timeline of events. * MITE LIFE CYCLE * The mites can be active where they crawl on your body, this is when they can lay eggs. * They create burrows that appear as bumps, wavy tiny white lines. * UNDERSTANDING THEIR LIFE CYCLE * Mites eggs take 3-4 days to hatch and about a week to mature * Larvae cannot reproduce immediately * When you take treatment (I recommend NOTHING but Ivermectin and Prometherin) ensure you understand these life cycles. Treating on Day 1,2,3,4 is over treating yourself and will cost money. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE CLEANING! DO NOT SKIP THIS! * BAG ALL YOUR CLOTHES * STEAM CLEAN PILLOWS * **ENCASE YOUR MATTRESS IN A PLASTIC COVERING** I emphasized these points in all caps because you cannot skip this. If you do you will not treat yourself and environment I can guarantee it. You don't have to remove everything or be excessive about cleaning past the first couple nights, just make sure your throughly clean everything for the first two nights and again on the seventh when you take another round of treatment. Treating with two people * This is very difficult, if you can avoid it do not sleep together for a week * This is tough but genuinely it helps so much. I would not recommend sleeping together at all it can cause the mites to move back and forth especially if you're sleeping skin to skin. General Timeline I got scabies from my university couch in January 2025, I had it until June 2025. It is very important to try to have a strong mental state, the mites can drive you insane (as they did with me). I highly recommend anti-histamines every single night you can (I used Claritin). Just take one two is not needed. * It took the doctors two months to properly diagnose scabies it is very difficult to spot esepcially early on. * Honestly, if anyone has had it around you I highly recommend treating yourself with the cream as soon as possible to avoid any potential concerns. * When I finally found out I had scabies I took the treatment along with my girlfriend I used ivermectin and she used the cream * big NONO, Ivermectin works differently than prometherin. If you're treating two people treat with the exact same thing (I recommend Ivermectin and prometherin at the same time) * Do not hesitate to demand things from your doctor that's what I had to do. * Throughout February-June we went through multiple incomplete treatments * Please ensure you treat yourself while taking care of your environment or else active mites will survive * You need to treat on day 1 and day 7. * If your case is persistent ask the doctor for ivermectin if it's available. Take the ivermectin that's dosed to your body weight on days 1,2 and 8,9. Why you make ask? This is because ivermectin's half-life is 12-56 hours meaning if you take it Day 1 and Day 2 you you have a higher dose of ivermectin in your body about 1.5x. This is safe in crusted scabies cases they use almost 2x a persons body weight. Things I learned Treat yourself day 1 and 7 if your case isn't persistent If you case is persistent ask for both ivermectin and premetherin on Day 1,2 and 8,9. (This is what I did) Ensure your environment is clean, mattresses covered in plastic, couches, bath mats removed, try not to touch anything for a few days, bag all the clothes you don't need and put the clothes you need in a bin, freeze your shoes (yes you read that right), they will die in a cold environment and this is what I did because I needed my work shoes the next day.

2fc0825bbc71d0329f00efaddc0da417,"  Glendale couple, delivery driver arrested in connection with organized retail theft ring Jul 11, 2025, 12:32 PM PHOENIX — Three people, including a married couple, were arrested for their alleged involvement in a Valley-based organized retail theft ring, authorities announced Thursday. The operation allegedly trafficked over $350,000 in stolen merchandise, according to the Phoenix Police Department. In addition, the group is suspected of similar crimes in Texas and Nevada, police said. A Glendale husband and wife — Nephtali Santiago-Garcia and Yuli “Nissy” Degante-Vigueras – are accused of being the primary sellers for the organized retail theft ring. How did Glendale couple allegedly run organized retail theft ring? They allegedly turned their living room into a storefront for $160,000 in products mostly stolen from Bath & Body Works locations. Police said they fenced stolen merchandise at least 17 times from April 2023 to April 2024. The couple was arrested on April 9, 2025, and booked on counts of theft, fraudulent schemes, illegal control of an enterprise and trafficking in stolen property. The ongoing investigation led to Marcos Ortega Hernandez, a driver for a trucking company that delivered products to retailers such as Bath & Body Works, Old Navy, Victoria's Secret, Gap and Banana Republic. He allegedly was paid over $72,000 to divert about $200,000 worth of merchandise to the Glendale couple so they could sell it. Hernandez was arrested June 26 after police served a search warrant at his home and found stolen items. He was booked for fraudulent schemes and trafficking in stolen property. Organized retail theft is a growing problem in metro Phoenix. The number of cases the Maricopa County Attorney's Office received almost doubled in 2024 compared to the year before.

mov_DF53E2F6C928895203B204C69E8878E8,"  It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains. Published a little over a century after its source of inspiration, Seth Grahame-Smith's Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (2009) retains the original characters and narrative but replaces some discussions of yearly allowances and the size of estates with talk of katanas and the undead. While we cannot be sure what author Jane Austen (1775-1817) would have made of the Bennet sisters getting trained by Shaolin monks, as one Goodreads review puts it: “Fans will either think this book is brilliant or are already setting fire to Seth Grahame-Smith's lawn.” As Janeites around the world celebrate the Regency author ahead of her 250th birthday this December, her modest but mighty body of work has not only endured, but evolved, lending itself to myriad adaptations, spin-offs, memes and even counting books for toddlers (two rich gentlemen, five sisters, and so on). In all likelihood, you would have first encountered Austen in the classroom or because an adult in your life wanted you to be 'well read'. I first heard of her when a slightly older, much cooler family friend confidently told me that “Just as every man can quote from The Godfather, every woman can quote from Pride and Prejudice.” It was a while before I realised what an untrue and gendered statement that was, but I forgave her. After all, she had introduced me to Austen. 250 years of Jane Austen: what to do to get your Austen fix 250 years of Jane Austen: what to do to get your Austen fix | Video Credit: The Hindu The statement set me off in search of the book. I still remember the look of surprise on the face of Pazhani, the proprietor of Easwari Lending Library in Chennai, when I handed it over to him to check out. Up until that moment, my main preoccupation in life was keeping the many rows of Mills & Boons in steady rotation.

The special educator and co-founder of Cosy Nook Library in Bengaluru is a self-proclaimed super fan, and remembers her mother saying, “Here is something that will change your life.” “And it did,” she says. Radhika Sathe Mantri, special educator and co-founder of Cosy Nook Library in Bengaluru, is an Austen super fan. Mantri has been 'obsessed' with the writer and her body of work since then, reading and rereading the novels and watching all the adaptations. “I even sat down and annotated my copy of Pride and Prejudice while watching the 1980 BBC version starring David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy. Did you know it's the closest to the original text? The Colin Firth one is quite massified,” she says, quickly adding that she still loves it. A still from the 1995 Pride and Prejudice TV drama, starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. Nidhi Bhandari, an undergraduate student, first made an attempt at reading the classics when she was 12. “I started with Moby Dick but I couldn't relate to it at all,” she tells me. “But when I read Austen, all the day-to-day matters of life that are usually dismissed — friendship, finding love, and gossip — she treated all of these seriously, validating them for me and my friends.” This need for validation is something that came up in my conversation with writer, translator, and critic Meenakshi Bharat. The retired professor taught Austen to Honours students at Sri Venkateswara College, University of Delhi, for many years. Writer, translator, and critic Meenakshi Bharat “Amongst my undergraduate students, the girls would instinctively take to Jane Austen, but the boys would smile and stay silent. If I asked them what they thought about it all, they would respond that the heroes looked silly. It appeared initially, as if going along with the 'romance' went against their 'male' instincts,” she tells me over a Zoom interview. Bharat has a keen interest in film adaptations and started using them as a way to bring her students closer to Austen's work. She says, “When we watch Gurinder Chadha's Bride and Prejudice (2004), which transposes Austen to an Indian milieu, they feel 'okay, this is my world'. And they start seeing that Austen has relevance to their lives; that she has something significant to say about life's choices at the personal and social levels; that her works give direction in this globalised scenario; that her directions are emotionally, socially and economically sound. That's validation!” Money and marriage still matter Some of us arrive at Austen's work through these adaptations, without even realising they are based on her books. Bhandari recalls reading Emma and feeling a jolt of recognition. “I had seen Clueless (1995) and Aisha (2010), and not realised they were based on a book at the time.” A still from Aisha (2010), an adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma. Clueless, which turns 30 this year, came up in my conversation with novelist Mahesh Rao, whose Polite Society sets Emma in Lutyens' Delhi. “Clueless is so sharp and clever in the way it transposes Austen to Beverly Hills. There's really no one more obsessed with popularity and who is in and who is out than high school students,” he says....","It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains.

n2r4x93,"  I'm so sorry you're dealing with this, and I can't imagine what you're going through. It's important that you and your wife give each other grace to grieve the way you each need to. I'm a child life specialist and talk with kids of all ages about death of siblings and other family members. It's important at her age to use the word “died”, even though that may seem odd to do, and giving a simple, concrete explanation will help. Something like “everyone has a heart that works hard to make their body work, but your sister's heart stopped so her body didn't work anymore and she died.” Three-year-olds don't really have a concept of death and its finality so it's totally normal for her to not be sad for long (or at all), but you can tell her that you/her mom are sad that she died so she may see you crying and that's okay. It can also help to keep her routine as “normal” as you can (still going to daycare, bath/bedtime, etc.). There's a couple books called “We were gonna have a baby, but we had an angel instead” and “The Invisible String” that I've used with siblings and you can order on Amazon.","I'm so sorry you're dealing with this, and I can't imagine what you're going through.

Something like “everyone has a heart that works hard to make their body work, but your sister's heart stopped so her body didn't work anymore and she died.” Three-year-olds don't really have a concept of death and its finality so it's totally normal for her to not be sad for long (or at all), but you can tell her that you/her mom are sad that she died so she may see you crying and that's okay. It can also help to keep her routine as “normal” as you can (still going to daycare, bath/bedtime, etc.). There's a couple books called “We were gonna have a baby, but we had an angel instead” and “The Invisible String” that I've used with siblings and you can order on Amazon.",2025-07-12 16:48:54,en,REDDIT,,,,,1,False,False,"The comment is about dealing with grief and discussing the death of a sibling with a child.

I used codes for a $25 account credit and $100 reimbursement. I plan to keep this out of my calculations, I removed the $25 reward from my rewards balance already. I subscribed to “perks premium” for $9.99/month which boosts the cash back to Gas 5% Groceries 7% Recurring payments 4.5% Everything else 1.5% It can be boosted further by having a balance in a checking account with them, this I am not doing as their checking account interest rate is only 0.1% Essentially the annual cost for the card plus perks will be $245. My previous year Costco rebate was just under $400. My plan is to see how long it takes to get to a rewards rebate of $645. See if this card really is worth it.

They also asked me to read and review it. I promised I would… Just kidding! They didn't have to wait that long! I did plan to post this sooner but I had other promised reviews and then life got in the way. But here it is, finally. When I read the title of the book, I missed the part on the bottom that it was written by the Bennets and Darcy's; along with their family and friends. I expected it to be an actual travel guide, but then opened it up. It contains about 60 short essays about the Regnecy era written by the Bennets, Bingleys, Darcys, Collinses, de Bourgs, Phillips, Gardiner, etc. Almost every family member writes something. It's interesting because this is kind of like a hybrid of genres; it has factual information about the Regency Era, but each one is “told” by a fictional character. I would definitely recommend this for Jane Austen fans who are interested in learning more about the culture and society the Pride and Prejudice characters lived in that isn't written in a textbook way. This is especially perfect for those who struggle reading nonfiction or avoid them. Some of the essays are written a little too well; the ones by Mr. Collins were very entertaining but also very flowery, pompous, and he could have definitely said the same thing in less words. It was a perfect representation! I really enjoyed the essays on ladies clothing, although my kindle edition had some drawing that were intact and then others that had portions missing, I'm not sure if that was a “printer's error” or if that was how the image was supposed to be. For instance some images look like this: But then others like this: But that is my only real complaint (that and I did spot a reference to Robert Lewis Stevenson who wasn't born before 1813). In “From Morning Calls to Royal Galas: The Proper Wardrobe for a Society Lady in London” by Louisa Hurst she mentions that women should wear “a delicate scent, such as rose or bergamot.” I can't wear perfume because I'm sensitive to smells, but when I read this I thought I love Earl Grey Tea, I would love to have bergamot as my personal scent. Then yesterday, I went shopping at Bath and Body Works for hand sanitizer, and discovered they have a whole Lavender and Bergamot line. They also have a Rose and Ivy line, so if you are looking for bergamot or rose they have you covered. I bought the hand sanitizer so now I too can have a “delicate scent.” I also enjoyed the essay “How to Host a Proper Ball” by Mrs. Bennet. This composition details all that goes into planning a ball from food, to lighting, to entertainment. This part also stood out to me: “Nothing flatters a young lady's complexion more than the soft glow of candlelight. What is a ball if not an occasion to shine?” It reminded me of what Fran Fine always says in The Nanny about the best lighting being candles, sunset, and moonlight. Emma (1996) I also really enjoyed “The Rhythm of a Country Day: A Guide to Social Customs” by Jane Bennet Bingley which offers a view into what an average day would be like for someone on the social scale of the Bennets in 1813 England. I love tea, so of course I loved reading “Steeped in Tradition: History and Varieties of English Tea” by Jane Bennet Bingley. This was a great read as it went over the brief history of tea being brought to England, the type of teas that people drank, and the custom of “tea time”. “…tea serves as both an introduction and an invitation. It is a moment to pause amidst the bustle of the day, to savour not only the beverage but the company and the ritual itself. Whether you find yourself enjoying a smoky Bohea, a refreshing Hyson, or a delicate Young Hyson, may your experience of tea offer both comfort and delight…” Reading it made me want to prepare myself a pot of tea.
