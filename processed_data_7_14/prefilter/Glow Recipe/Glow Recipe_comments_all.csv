mov_D23E3712A15B4021B7A3F4739138284B,"‚Äâ The how, why and when of collagen banking The beauty world is ever evolving and no where is that more evident than in our skincare routines. From the emergence of new ingredients to breakthrough formulations, the skincare world is constantly innovating which is great news for anyone who strives to keep their skin looking its best. In truth, however, while there are a whole host of ingredients out there which promise to improve skin texture, fight fine lines or boost radiance, all these skin concerns all come down to one thing, a building block that's naturally found in our skin itself and which sadly decreases as we get older ‚Äî collagen. ‚ÄúCollagen is a protein that provides structure and support to our muscles, skin, connective tissues and bones. It is vital for skin firmness, plumpness and elasticity,‚Äù says Dr Derrick Phillips. ‚ÄúThe body naturally produces collagen to keep the skin healthy, but collagen production slows down with age and can also become depleted prematurely as a result of lifestyle factors such as UV exposure, smoking, and poor diet.‚Äù It's in light of this decrease in collagen that many skincare experts have come to hail ‚Äúcollagen banking‚Äù as the best way to keep our skin looking its best both now and in the future. So, what exactly does collagen banking mean? I turned to an army of skincare experts to get their expert advice on the how, why and when of collagen banking. You may like Firstly, what is collagen banking? ‚ÄúCollagen banking refers to the idea of early stimulation and preservation of collagen in the skin to prevent or delay signs of aging down the line,‚Äù says Dr Sina Ghadiri, Consultant Dermatologist and founder of Sinaesthetics, ‚Äúthe idea being that by 'banking' collagen in your 20s or 30s, you're setting yourself up for smoother, firmer skin later in your 50s, 60s and 70s.‚Äù What this means is, ‚Äúby proactively supporting your skin's collagen production now [through skincare, diet and professional treatments], you [can] help maintain stronger, more resilient skin in the years to come,‚Äù says Dr Dev Patel, Aesthetic Physician, Skin Doctor and founder of CellDerma. It's worth noting however, ‚ÄúIt's not literally ‚Äústoring‚Äù collagen in reserve,‚Äù Dr Ghadiri continued, ‚Äúbut by boosting your skin's natural collagen production capabilities before visible signs of aging occur, the aim would be to maintain a more youthful baseline for longer.‚Äù What are the benefits of collagen banking? We've already touched on many of the benefits of collagen banking especially when it comes to our skin but do the experts agree with these claims? Marie Claire Newsletter Celebrity news, beauty, fashion advice, and fascinating features, delivered straight to your inbox! By submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over. ‚Äú‚Äã‚ÄãCollagen banking can improve skin quality, keeping the skin supple, plump and healthy, and reducing the appearance of fine lines, and wrinkles which are the hallmark of premature skin ageing,‚Äù says Dr Phillips. Dr Ghadiri agrees, adding that by delaying the onset of fine lines and wrinkles, collagen banking can also ‚Äúreduce the need for potentially more invasive or aggressive procedures longer term.‚Äù And, it's not only your skin that can reap the benefits, ‚ÄúCollagen banking also goes beyond the skin,‚Äù says Dr Patel, ‚ÄúCollagen contains amino acids - especially proline - that the body uses to build keratin, the key structural protein in hair. [This means that collagen banking] also supports the health of the scalp and surrounding blood vessels, helping to create an optimal environment for hair growth and strength. Additionally, collagen plays a crucial role in maintaining joint and bone health, offering benefits that go well beyond cosmetics.‚Äù When should I start collagen banking? As collagen banking is best used as a preventative method, the earlier you start the better, ‚ÄúGenerally, it will be better suited for people from their mid-20s, as from around age 25, collagen production starts declining,‚Äù says Dr Ghadiri, ‚ÄúHowever, those seeing early signs of ageing (e.g. dullness, hollowing, fine lines) or with lifestyle risk factors (UV exposure, stress, smoking, poor sleep) may need to act sooner, and there isn't a one-size-fits-all all policy.‚Äù For those who are older, it's never too late to start. ‚ÄúStarting later is better than not starting at all,‚Äù explained Dr Phillips, ‚Äúas you will still see improvements in the look and feel of your skin.‚Äù So, exactly how do you start collagen banking? Once again, my experts were on hand with all the best advice‚Ä¶ 1. Introduce retinoids ‚ÄúA strong topical skincare regime is paramount,‚Äù says Dr Ghadiri. Firstly, retinoids, as ‚Äúthey are strong players in increasing collagen synthesis.‚Äù Retinoids work by increasing your skin cell turnover which in turn increases collagen production. Start with a low dosage and build up your tolerance to see the best results. Crystal Retinal 6 Resurfacing Retinol Serum 2. Add Vitamin C Next, introduce Vitamin C into your skincare routine. This works to ‚Äústabilise and protect collagen,‚Äù Dr Ghadiri continued, and also has ‚Äústrong photoprotective properties against UV damage."" SkinCeuticals 10% Waterless Vitamin C Serum 3. Peptides + Growth Factors ‚ÄúBio- and neuro-peptides have been shown to effect positive changes in the architecture of the skin,‚Äù says Dr Patel, ‚Äúso including these ingredients in your skincare routine is going to stimulate collagen production and target the facial expression muscles to soften existing wrinkles‚Äù And Dr Ghadiri agreed, ‚ÄúPeptides and growth factors support essential regulatory roles in many processes [including] cell signalling to stimulate collagen production.‚Äù Allies of Skin Multi Peptides & Growth Factors Advanced Lifting Serum...","The how, why and when of collagen banking The beauty world is ever evolving and no where is that more evident than in our skincare routines.

1A558FB6FDF87D5056204896075DE207,"‚Äâ If you're headed to New Orleans and you mention it to anyone, you'll be directed to the boundless joys of muffulettas and po' boys, gumbos and √©touff√©es, red beans and rice and jambalaya. This list goes on, an American canon built by overlapping culinary influences in what was once a hub for Indigenous tribes and later the trans-Atlantic slave trade, shaped and reshaped by hundreds of years of colonial rule and immigrant flux. Every city has its greatest hits from another century, its repertoire of untouchable classics, but New Orleans is so loaded with them, it can seem a little unfair. It can also give a visitor the wrong impression -- as if, somewhere back there, the city got stuck in time. No, the juice is always running here, and those influences keep bopping together deliciously. Call the Gulf whatever you want. At Acamaya, the chef Ana Castro insists on the connection between Louisiana and Mexico. Ms. Castro nixtamalizes heirloom corn to make chochoyotes, and lately she has immersed the pudgy, dimpled masa dumplings in a slippery green sauce, lush with sweet crab meat, prickling with the warmth of poblano chiles and peppery nasturtium leaves. To collect that crab, Ms. Castro drives 30 miles south from her restaurant in the Bywater neighborhood, past cypress trees slung with Spanish moss, to a centuries-old fishing village called Lafitte. That's where Dottie and Dennis Higgins run Higgins Seafood. Higgins is a tenuous family business, so small it's sometimes just the two of them cooking and picking and packing. To do their work, they rely on Gulf Coast fishermen up against forces beyond their control: a dwindling labor pool, shameless restaurants passing off imported seafood as local, and ferocious storms that batter a disappearing coast. Does the vulnerability of a taste sharpen its pleasure? If Ms. Castro can't get crab from Higgins, you won't find it on the menu at all. But you might find something else -- a surprising guest appearance from some less marketable fish, like strawberry grouper or barracuda, triggerfish or hogfish. Adapting to what purveyors can or can't get is as much a creative choice as a survival skill for some kitchens now -- a way to build interdependence and sustain a community against disasters, big and small. (''The idea that everything must be available at all times is a capitalistic construct,'' Ms. Castro told me over the phone.) Ms. Castro, who was born in Texas and grew up both there and in Mexico City, built her reputation with the Mexican tasting menus she devised at Lengua Madre in New Orleans, where she partnered with the chef and restaurateur Michael Stoltzfus. It was open only a few weeks in 2021 when Hurricane Ida blew the roof off. When the restaurant reopened months later, press and accolades followed -- Ms. Castro was in the national spotlight. She opened Acamaya last year with her sister Lydia Castro, who manages the place. The restaurant is light on its feet, constantly revising and adjusting. Though it doesn't specialize in crowd pleasers for the jazz dads, it knows how to satisfy them with carne asada and a sturdy costra -- here a tunnel of lightly browned cheese that might hold crawfish or shrimp -- on a flour tortilla. The blackened flounder is as Cajun as it is Veracruzana, with a paprika-heavy seasoning seared against the fish, and a briny stew of canned tomatoes and olives, lit with lemon zest. It's elegant grandma cooking (truly, the recipe is borrowed from Ms. Castro's grandma). Some of the riskier dishes play with unflinching bitterness. Results are expansive, as in the inky, crunchy arroz negro, the rice embellished with squid and shrimp, deeper and darker still with a blot of ripe huitlacoche. They can also be extreme, as in the sticky octopus smeared with cacao nib salsa macha and a slightly menacing coffee aioli. The kitchen cooks seafood with expertise, but can seem unnerved by vegetables, which tend to sound more exciting than they taste. A roasted beet dish that promised the flavors of hibiscus, sour cherry and rhubarb landed unexpectedly wet and muffled. There is a spikiness to Acamaya -- don't be fooled by the soft pink glow it emits on Dauphine Street. The restaurant takes some visual and spiritual inspiration from a young, progressive generation of restaurants in Mexico City. The kitchen is open, and the dining room is small but somehow capacious-feeling -- big tables set far apart. There's no tasting menu, but there is an ounce of golden Kaluga caviar on the menu for $90. The caviar course can be predictable, but this one comes with an unlikely extravagance: half a dozen popcorn-scented gorditas, their bubbled exteriors still hot and crackling and salty, ideal for splitting and filling with bean pur√©e and crema -- as well as the requisite cured egg yolk and chives. It might be jarring to spot gorditas and caviar on a menu if you're scanning for chips and salsa, but Acamaya isn't a chips-and-salsa kind of restaurant. It isn't dead-serious, committed to regional specialties, either. It's more idiosyncratic and puckish than that, more brainy and rewarding. Servers are composed, but approachable, and don't tend to explain the dishes much, though you might overhear them consoling diners who were expecting free guac, not crab chochoyotes. There's no easy way to say it: The guac isn't free. Also, there isn't any. Follow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest.

mov_1C64AEDF98FB238873A21483590FA1CF,"‚Äâ Monsoon may be romantic, but your skin, hands, and feet often tell a different story. The combination of muddy streets, humidity, wet shoes, and pollution creates a perfect recipe for skin irritation, dullness, and unwanted infections, especially in urban chaos like Mumbai. That's where a seasonal visit to a trusted salon becomes more than a luxury, it's a necessity. Your feet face the brunt of the season, literally. They're stuck in wet shoes, exposed to puddles, and forgotten once home. Monsoon causes the skin on your feet to soften, increasing the risk of infections and cracked heels. A proper pedicure at a salon doesn't just clean, it rejuvenates. From anti-bacterial soaks and exfoliation to hydration masks and massages, it helps restore hygiene and softness. Salons offers monsoon-special pedicures with added exfoliating scrubs and foot masks to prevent infections and boost circulation. If there's one reason to make a salon visit this season, let your feet be it. Constant washing and exposure to rain can leave your hands feeling dry, cracked, and aged. Monsoon hand care isn't just about manicures and pretty nails, it's about restoring softness, removing dead skin, and treating your nails and cuticles with nourishing oils. Look for a salon that includes paraffin dips or deep hydration masks in their monsoon hand rituals. These treatments not only feel luxurious, but they also work to prevent your hands from developing that rough, weather-worn look. Your Face Deserves a Monsoon Detox Too The humidity and pollution of Mumbai during the rains clog pores and leave your skin looking dull. That's where a facial tailored to this season comes in. Treatments like Mary Cohr's CatioVital Facial are designed to deeply cleanse, oxygenate, and hydrate the skin in one go. This facial includes a deep cleanse using steam and ionization, which opens up pores and infuses the skin with active ingredients. It not only clears out pollution and impurities but also revives tired skin that's been dulled by weather and stress. There's something about stepping into a quiet salon on a rainy day that feels instantly calming. The sound of rain outside, the warmth of a facial bed, the feeling of your hair being massaged, all of it combines to give you not just beauty benefits, but mental peace. Mary Cohr offers professional services that combine facial, foot care, and head massage, and many more into a single session, making it the perfect rainy-day ritual. Mumbai, Don't Let the Weather Dim Your Glow Monsoon is a time of chaos, but it can also be a time of pause. Let the rain slow you down just enough to take care of yourself. Whether it's fixing those post-rain feet, reviving your glow with a facial, or softening your hands from all the handwashing, we owe our bodies that little reset. A salon visit this season is no longer an indulgence; it's just smart skincare. Your feet, hands, and face will thank you.","Monsoon may be romantic, but your skin, hands, and feet often tell a different story.

Salons offers monsoon-special pedicures with added exfoliating scrubs and foot masks to prevent infections and boost circulation. If there's one reason to make a salon visit this season, let your feet be it. Constant washing and exposure to rain can leave your hands feeling dry, cracked, and aged. Monsoon hand care isn't just about manicures and pretty nails, it's about restoring softness, removing dead skin, and treating your nails and cuticles with nourishing oils. Look for a salon that includes paraffin dips or deep hydration masks in their monsoon hand rituals. These treatments not only feel luxurious, but they also work to prevent your hands from developing that rough, weather-worn look. Your Face Deserves a Monsoon Detox Too The humidity and pollution of Mumbai during the rains clog pores and leave your skin looking dull. That's where a facial tailored to this season comes in. Treatments like Mary Cohr's CatioVital Facial are designed to deeply cleanse, oxygenate, and hydrate the skin in one go. This facial includes a deep cleanse using steam and ionization, which opens up pores and infuses the skin with active ingredients. It not only clears out pollution and impurities but also revives tired skin that's been dulled by weather and stress. There's something about stepping into a quiet salon on a rainy day that feels instantly calming. The sound of rain outside, the warmth of a facial bed, the feeling of your hair being massaged, all of it combines to give you not just beauty benefits, but mental peace. Mary Cohr offers professional services that combine facial, foot care, and head massage, and many more into a single session, making it the perfect rainy-day ritual. Mumbai, Don't Let the Weather Dim Your Glow Monsoon is a time of chaos, but it can also be a time of pause. Let the rain slow you down just enough to take care of yourself. Whether it's fixing those post-rain feet, reviving your glow with a facial, or softening your hands from all the handwashing, we owe our bodies that little reset. A salon visit this season is no longer an indulgence; it's just smart skincare. Your feet, hands, and face will thank you.",2025-07-04 07:08:04,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The provided content is entirely about salon services during the monsoon season in Mumbai and does not mention Glow Recipe skincare products or have any meaningful connection to the brand.

There are more deals than you could ever begin to look through on your own...so that's where we come in.

We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial¬†here. 1. The TikTok-viral Tirtir cushion foundation ‚Äî for 60% off, a new lowest-ever price! ‚Äî that offers 72 hours of flawless wear, blending seamlessly to hide redness, blemishes, and under-eye bags. It has buildable coverage, perfect for a natural look or full glam. Plus, it's packed with hibiscus and red propolis extracts for a boost in skin elasticity. And to top it all off, its oval-shaped puff can reach every little corner of your face. Check out this TikTok of Mikayla Nogueira's review of this foundation. Promising review: ""I struggle with finding a foundation that's not orange. Someone recommended I try a Korean product, and this started going viral around the same time. I lucked into a perfect color match on the first try, but I've learned there are sample packs if you aren't sure about the color. The coverage is incredible. It was very lightweight, not heavy at all. It did settle into my under-eye wrinkles without primer, so if you're older, that's something to keep in mind. Overall, beautiful and long-lasting. This will be my go-to foundation from now on."" ‚ÄîAJ Bond Price: $10 (originally $25; available in 40 shades and a mini size) 2. A ""Gracula"" garlic crusher for 57% off, because you know what? If a 108-year-old vampire lurking moodily in the trees in the Pacific Northwest isn't going to fall in love with you and grant you immortality, one might as well make your life in the kitchen a little easier. Promising review: ""I love this little guy. I found him on a BuzzFeed list and had to have it as soon as I saw it! I've minced as many as five cloves in it in seconds. It's a little tricky getting all of the garlic out once minced (I use a silicone basting brush to get most of it, but I always use more than the recipe calls for anyway, so it's not a deal breaker). Cleanup is a breeze because he goes right in the dishwasher!"" ‚ÄîBarbie Price: $9.95 (typically $18.99) 3. Mixsoon Bean Essence for 55% off (the lowest price it's ever been!!) ‚Äî this TikTok-beloved K-beauty staple for exfoliating and hydrating is a secret weapon that anyone chasing the ~glass skin~ look will want to know about immediately. You can use this as a low-maintenance, high results exfoliant by massaging it into your skin two to three times a week for a smoother, brighter, more even complexion. Promising reviews: ""I saw this all over TikTok/Instagram and decided to buy it because I have a lot of sebaceous filaments on my chin and nose. It's a little expensive but I took a gamble: it works! You can physically see the sebaceous filaments come out of your pores; it is not the product bunching up. My problem areas were so much smoother after using and were left with a moisturized glow. I then proceeded to have my boyfriend use this product to see if it worked this well on everyone on the first try, and it worked on his nose as well. Amazing stuff.

From the Battle of Gettysburg to the well-preserved Victorian landmarks in Ridgway, every corner in the state is immaculate. Travel back in time when visiting Wellsboro, a pristine town with gaslit posts and a town square taken from a classic novel. Wander through the Story Book Forest in Ligonier to see childhood tales in three dimensions. While the autumn months light up the entire state, Jim Thorpe is a must-see when paired with a legendary train ride through the diverse landscape. Each town represents a chapter in Pennsylvania's compelling fairytale story. Jim Thorpe Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, in fall colors. Commonly known as the Little Switzerland of America, Jim Thorpe is a fairytale town in Pennsylvania surrounded by the lush forests of the Pocono Mountains. With a European-style downtown and streets lined with Victorian buildings, Jim Thorpe is a living postcard. Many residents count down the days until the annual Jim Thorpe Fall Festival, when the area comes alive with warm hues. Held on the first three weekends in October, the Fall Festival is jam-packed with local storytellers, live music, craft vendors, and local eateries offering foods and drinks bursting with autumn flavors. One of the best ways to go leaf peeping in Jim Thorpe is by hopping on the Lehigh Gorge Scenic Railway. Although the ride is memorable in any season, it is a phenomenal way to relax and be in awe of Pennsylvania's natural wonder. The town center in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. Image credit zimmytws via Shutterstock The town changed its name to honor Olympic athlete, and one of America's Best, Jim Thorpe. Visitors wishing to pay their respects can head to the Jim Thorpe Memorial. From a statue to various plaques highlighting his accomplishments, along with his final resting place, the area is thoughtfully designed to commemorate the legacy of the legend himself.

Chef David Thompson talks flavour, chaos, chocolate, and why Thai food still thrills him, 40 years on Chef David Thompson took Sunday mid day (and our 11-year-old plus one) straight into the kitchen for a hands-on masterclass in green Thai curry. Pic/Raj Patil We'd been warned ‚Äî Chef David Thompson's humour is, well, esoteric. Bold, even. And more often than not, it kicks off with the F-word. But when we met him at EHV International's Fireback Mumbai, he was calmer, more affable ‚Äî still razor-sharp, and wickedly funny. His wit doesn't keep you out ‚Äî you feel like an insider in his jokes. What followed was a fun, heartwarming conversation, after which he whisked us, along with our 11-year-old companion, straight into the kitchen to teach him how to make a proper green Thai curry. Thompson is patient in the kitchen, generous with his time, and peppers his teaching with his signature dry humour. What emerges is far from the watered-down versions we've come to expect ‚Äî it's raw, robust, and unapologetically bold. Widely regarded as one of the world's leading authorities on Thai cuisine, Thompson brings far more than recipes to Fireback (named after Thailand's national bird, the Siamese Fireback). First introduced in Goa last year, the concept builds on Thai cooking's primal rhythm, where spice and texture aren't mere accents, but integral to the structure. There's no overthinking, no heavy-handed reinterpretation ‚Äî just confident, flavour-forward food. Opening July 14 in Mumbai, the space is designed by Russell Sage Studio. and balances raw, tactile materials with clean lines and subtle nods to Thai design. A sculptural light feature undulates across the ceiling, casting a soft glow over the textured surfaces. Below, a long, sculpted bar anchors the room ‚Äî easygoing by day, electric by night, much like the rhythm of Thai street life. At the helm is Brand Chef Kaustubh Haldipur, leading a crew that has been trained under Thompson in Bangkok. He says, ‚ÄúWe are thrilled to bring Fireback to Mumbai. The food has proven to be bold, unique, and unlike most Thai offerings in the city. In a place like Mumbai, where diners are curious and open, this style will truly thrive. Working closely with Chef David, I've learned that Thai cuisine is about more than spice‚Äîit's about rhythm, restraint, and deep respect for ingredients. We're not reinventing the cuisine, just presenting it with honesty.‚Äù Kaustubh Haldipur The drinks programme follows suit. Crafted by Varun Sharma, Head of Bars at EHV International, the cocktails lean into Thai ingredients with inventive flair with drinks like The Thai Spiced Diablo that mixes tequila with tomato water and wasabi foam; the Tom Yum Highball pairs gin with guava and lemongrass cordial; while the Mango Rice takes cues from the iconic dessert, blending rum with mango and rice cordial. To complement the complexity of the food, Kevin Rodrigues has curated a thoughtful wine list, available by the glass. It is fruit-forward, aromatic, and perfectly lifts the spice. The menu plays out like a quiet conversation between the familiar and the unexpected. We began with Miang Kham (Rs 595) ‚Äî a textural betel leaf bundle layered with pomelo, toasted coconut, and roasted peanuts. The Spring Roll (Rs 595) with shiitake mushroom, garlic chives and glass noodles was comforting, while the Mushroom Larb (Rs 795), a northern-style herb salad with toasted rice powder and chilli, brought a gentler heat. The Pineapple Som Tam (Rs 595), a sweet-sour twist on the classic papaya salad, balanced tamarind, palm sugar and crushed peanuts with a punch of freshness. Mango & Sticky rice From the Josper grill, the Prawns Nahm Jim ¬†(Rs 1195) arrived smoky and succulent, with a lively mix of garlic, chillies, coriander root, lime, fish sauce, and palm sugar. And there was the Chicken Gorlae (Rs 675), marinated, double-basted, and triple-grilled. The Mango sticky rice (Rs 750)was beautifully done ‚Äî fragrant, not too sweet, and comforting. The Grilled banana (Rs 595) with Thai crispy roti and condensed milk ice cream was indulgent, unexpected, and the kind of dessert you don't share ‚Äî the perfect finish.

The science behind ""red sky at morning, sailor's warning "" reveals a fascinating intersection of atmospheric physics, light behavior, and meteorological patterns that continues to amaze modern scientists. The ""red sky at morning "" warning traces its roots back thousands of years to ancient civilizations who depended entirely on natural signs for weather prediction. Mediterranean sailors were among the first to document this phenomenon, passing down the knowledge through generations of maritime families. Ancient Greek and Roman texts reference the crimson dawn as a harbinger of rough seas and dangerous sailing conditions. Archaeological evidence suggests that even Bronze Age cultures recognized the connection between morning sky colors and incoming weather systems. These early observers lacked scientific instruments but possessed something equally valuable: generations of careful observation and pattern recognition. Their survival often depended on reading nature's subtle signals correctly.

These early observers lacked scientific instruments but possessed something equally valuable: generations of careful observation and pattern recognition. Their survival often depended on reading nature's subtle signals correctly. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters countless particles that scatter different wavelengths of light in various directions. Blue light, with its shorter wavelength, scatters more readily than red light, which has a longer wavelength. This principle, known as Rayleigh scattering, explains why we see blue skies on clear days and red skies under certain atmospheric conditions. During sunrise, sunlight must travel through more atmosphere to reach our eyes, filtering out most blue light along the way. The remaining red and orange wavelengths create the dramatic colors we associate with dawn. However, the intensity and distribution of these colors depend heavily on atmospheric conditions, particularly the presence of water vapor and dust particles.

Weather systems moving from west to east across most temperate regions create predictable patterns that ancient observers learned to read. When high pressure systems dominate an area, they typically bring clear, stable conditions with minimal cloud cover. These systems allow morning sunlight to penetrate the atmosphere with less obstruction, often producing beautiful but relatively pale sunrise colors. High pressure areas also tend to suppress the formation of new cloud systems, leading to several days of fair weather. Experienced weather watchers know that pale or golden morning skies often indicate continued pleasant conditions. The absence of dramatic red coloring suggests that the atmosphere contains fewer particles and moisture that would signal approaching storms.
