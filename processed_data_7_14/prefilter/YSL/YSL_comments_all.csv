The main notes are a beautiful blend: it opens with a fresh and vibrant bergamot, leading into a heart of rich orange üçä blossom, and finally settling into a warm and sensual base of woods üå≤üå¥ and patchouli. It's truly a modern masculine floral that feels both powerful and elegant. The sillage is fantastic, leaving a lovely trail, and the longevity is impressive ‚Äì it lasts all day without needing a top-up! Another major benefit? It's a REFILLABLE spray ‚ôªÔ∏è Love that YSL is stepping up with sustainable options. It's an investment that keeps on giving.

The main notes are a beautiful blend: it opens with a fresh and vibrant bergamot, leading into a heart of rich orange blossom, and finally settling into a warm and sensual base of woods and patchouli. It's truly a modern masculine floral that feels both powerful and elegant. The sillage is fantastic, leaving a lovely trail, and the longevity is impressive ‚Äì it lasts all day without needing a top-up! Another major benefit? It's a REFILLABLE spray Love that YSL is stepping up with sustainable options. It's an investment that keeps on giving. You can find this incredible scent at , , and directly.

mov_17CCF83D49AE6F8199AE48EAA9C46571,"‚Äâ The results of this menswear season's top 10 most-viewed shows list on are in. Every season, this list acts as a failsafe indicator of which collections have captured the attention of those who are more interested in the clothes than the front rows. As ever, the list is ordered according to the amount of views each collection logged on within its first 48 hours of publication. And as ever, this season has thrown up a few surprises. There are four new entries on the list this season, of which only one ‚Äì Yves Saint Laurent ‚Äì we expected to see. That reliably blockbuster show has been held outside of the mainstream menswear calendar for the last few seasons, and its in-season arrival on the Paris schedule made it an almost certainty to figure here. The three other new entries include the oldest designer on the list, the second youngest designer on the list, and the longest serving non-founder creative director in all of fashion. This season, eight of the top 10 collections were presented in Paris, with only two in Milan. That will be catnip to those who contend that Milan lacks ‚Äúenergy‚Äù. And only one of the collections on the list was not presented on the runway, which will cheer those who relish watching fashion theatre in its purest form. Two of the collections were debut shows for creative directors at well-established houses. And you needn't need to be a fashion clairvoyant to divine which show, this season, would be the most-viewed. Haute-bourgeois boys in leather pants plus the hottest bags in the business make Herm√®s an irresistible viewing pleasure for many among menswear's cognoscenti. So it's little surprise to see French luxury's most serene heritage marque sliding back into this season's top 10, making it the first of the list's new entries. And without wishing to spoil the reveal at the other end of this list, there is a satisfying symmetry to the fact that V√©ronique Nichanian is the longest-serving creative director in all of fashion (menswear included). Herm√®s SS26 Men's. Photo: Daniele Oberrauch/ Gorunway.com Second new entry Grace Wales Bonner is also the second youngest designer on this list. This season, she was presenting a collection that marked her 10th anniversary as one of the most precarious of entities in fashion: a London-based indie. In her review, my colleague Sarah Mower described as a ‚Äútotal disgrace‚Äù the fact that GWB has not yet been tapped to be creative director of another brand or house, and that reading is fair enough; however, another way of seeing it might be that Wales Bonner is simply too self-determined to let herself be pinned down. Her three-pronged combo of artistic practice, conscious menswear opulence and hit Adidas output seems to have generated a stable and self-sustaining business ecosystem that she's thriving in.

Before the show, I spoke to a few bench buddies who were, like me, a little trepidatious on his behalf: last season's menswear lookbook (a sort of holding collection as Klausner warmed his seat) seemed rather a narrow vision of this most expansive of design visions.

That factor, plus the sheer enormity of this collection, might both have contributed to Mr Armani's return to the most-viewed menswear list this season.

But in my opinion, the inclusion in this list of a lookbook-delivered collection of which more than 60 per cent of the images (by my quick count) relate to womenswear resort rather than to menswear Spring/Summer 2026 is, at best, a margin call. Still, it's also our margin call. Its place here on behalf of a collection presentation at which the ever observant Amy Verner highlighted the Julian Schnabel clothing rack upon which a pyjama set was displayed, is a powerful testament to the enigmatic magnetism of a brand that is both discreet and discrete.

Just *tap, tap, tap* the little powderpuff where you need some oil control, and your 'do will look freshly-washed with the added perk of mega volume. Pro tip: Apply just a bit of product, brush it out, and repeat. Putting too much product at once may lead to a sheen of white residue. Promising review: ""I was looking for a dry shampoo that would be easy to use on the go for a trip I was taking. I had no issues taking this through TSA, and it was so easy to use on the go. You literally just pat the poof on your scalp and then rub the powder in. I do have black hair, so dry shampoo is usually very visible in my hair, but I didn't have any harder time than usual rubbing this powder in. It did a really good job of soaking up all the oil and giving my hair volume. I'm not a fan of the price for the amount that you get, but it is lasting longer than I thought it would. I would definitely recommend and will purchase again."" ‚ÄîTeresa Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in seven shades). 3.

The passion, knowledge, and honest feedback here really guided me through my fragrance journey. In the last 4 months, I went all in tried over 150+ decants, visited a few local perfumeries, and explored and owned tons of perfume oils beyond what I'm sharing in this post. After a lot of research (and a bit of obsession), I ended up collecting these fragrances, and let's just say‚Ä¶ it became quite the addiction! That said, I've decided to hit pause and not buy any more fragrances for the rest of the year (with one exception that might arrive in the next couple of days). I'll still be around and happy to help anyone here however I can. Thanks again for being such a great part of this journey! **Note**: I am not an expert , I trust my nose more than reviews, please do research or test fragrances before you buy, I am from Middle east / Asia English is not my native language, I apologize in advance for any mistakes i try to explain this in my words without using any AI or correction tool. I am reviewing all fragrances after giving them time to mature. From Top Left to Right: 1. **Icon by Dunhill**: Really Good citrusy, Aromatic and floral scent. A good alternative for those who don't like sweet or overly citrusy scents for summer. 2. **1 Million Prive:** The most complimented one on my list, absolutely amazing winter scent with sweet and tobacco notes; I failed to find anything that can beat that fragrance. 3. **1 Million Elixir:** Very sweet and creamy vanilla with colorful floral tones, especially on the dry down. Lasts a long time and projection is strong. **4. ** ¬† **Jasoor:** Clone of VUBIR Coral Fantasy Long Lasting with Good projection, Very Versatile for year-round wear except very hot evenings. **5. ** ¬† **Asad Bourbon:** Clone that covers VUBIR Intense, Most Wanted and Stronger with you. Smells cozy and rich. Feels confident and warm. **6. ** ¬† **Khamrah :** Amazing Scent, Sweet,¬† Warm , Cozy with Vanilla and amber. 7. **Khamrah Dukhan:** I tried Liquid Burn, and to my nose, it smells quite similar that same warm, spicy DNA. But Khamrah Dukhan was much cheaper, so I went for it. It's incredibly long-lasting and feels like a spicier, less sweet version of Khamrah. If the sweetness in the original Khamrah isn't your thing, this might be a better fit. Honestly, it's underrated and didn't get the recognition it deserves from early buyers or reviewers. This one needs more attention, it's a hidden gem. 8. **Alpine Homme Sport**: Clone of Allure Homme Sport, as a Sporty scent both last 4-5 hours, and it's enough for a sports session, very good gym scent. 9. **CDN Precieux:** Clone of Aventus Absolu with Twist, Great performance and quality scent better and smoother when compared with Supremacy CE but costs more and feel more expensive **10. ** **Mont Blanc Starwalker:** absolute masterpiece a good night time / bedtime scent. Calming and relaxing, Hyped for a reason very unique scent. **11. ** **Dunhill Desire for a man:** Apple, Citrus and Rose based scent, classic cheap summer scent suitable for any age. 12. **L'Homme by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of L'Homme Lacoste, long lasting, sweet, citrusy fresh scent. FD is a small local perfumery in my area. 13. **L'Homme Intense by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of Dior Homme Intense, Dior Homme intense clones were mostly sold out and its hard to get them in my country so i visited a local perfumery where they had this clone its using same french oils used by other clone houses.

tw_sl_1a7b4fe388f1cc2353b719ba899f3398,"‚Äâ The tale of the Kolhapuri isn't contemporary, its roots run deep in Indian artisanal history Amidst the ongoing Prada Kolhapuri row, the Italian luxury brand recently faced legal action for selling its Indian-inspired flat leather sandals for Rs 1.2 lakh a pair. They now face demands to ""pay back Indians"". NDTV speaks to industry expert and Kolhapuri footwear brand owner, Aparajita Toor, to trace the journey of Kolhapuris through the years. This summer's hottest sandals, after all, are the Kolhapuris. The History Of Kolhapuri Chappals Kolhapuri chappals go back to the 12th century Kolhapur in Maharashtra, where artisans painstakingly craft these open sandals out of leather. Both King Bijjala and his prime minister, Basavanna, have been credited with encouraging the production of these footwear pieces to support local artisans. In their nascent years, Kolhapuri chappals were known by a couple of different names, generally based on their village of origin, such as Kapashi, Paytaan, Kachkadi, Bakkalnali and Pukri. By the 18th century, Kolhapuri chappals had become popular, and became known by their present name. Today, Kolhapuris are world-famous for their unique design and intricate handwork, which involves vegetable-tanned leather, braiding techniques, unique designs, and exceptional craftsmanship. It's precisely these qualities that have led to Kolhapuris being included in the footwear lineup of global luxury brands such as Prada, YSL, and more. What's more, in 2019, the Kolhapuri chappal was granted a Geographical Indication (GI) tag, officially recognising its origin and unique characteristics. Is The Kolhapuri A 'Trend'? NDTV spoke to Aparajita Toor, who runs a Kolhapuri footwear label favoured by Bollywood celebrities, named after herself. It was Aparajita Toor's undying love for Kolhapuris that made her realise the inherent need for comfortable, expressive, and wearable footwear for women, leading to the inception of the Aprajita Toor brand, a label symbolic of India's rich cultural heritage. Aparajita tells NDTV about where, when and how the Kolhapuri 'trend' began, according to her. ""To call it a 'trend' almost feels limiting. The Kolhapuri isn't a passing style; it's a 12th-century heirloom craft, rooted in tradition, history, and generational skill. If anything, it was never out of fashion; it was simply waiting to be re-seen, re-styled, and re-celebrated,"" Toor tells NDTV. Aparajita says that the Kolhapuri silhouette is timeless, and that she knew it could walk further. ""The craft has always been here, quietly holding its ground through generations. What's changed is the lens. The recent spotlight isn't because the silhouette is new; it's because the narrative around it is finally shifting. People are beginning to ask the right questions: Why hasn't this heritage craft been given the credit it so deeply deserves? It's not a trend revival. It's a long-overdue recognition of legacy,"" says Toor. Pride, Patience, And Wisdom For every artisan who crafts a Kolhapuri chappal, it comes with patience, pride, and wisdom. ""For the artisans, every Kolhapuri is the fruit of labor, not just of hands, but of heart. It's crafted with deep patience, quiet pride, and generational wisdom. While the design may appear simple, it demands an extraordinary eye for detail and a steady hand trained in caution. Every stitch, every cut, every curve is intentional,"" says Aparajita Toor. She adds, ""It's not just footwear. It's legacy, shaped by those who've spent a lifetime perfecting what others may overlook. The Kolhapuri isn't just a sandal; it's a living legacy. A symbol of heritage, skill, and storytelling, passed down through generations of master artisans."" The Kolhapuri's moment on the global stage is a reflection of rich artistic lineage, says Toor. ""Its silhouette speaks of timeless design, while its making reflects the kind of craftsmanship that the world is only now beginning to truly value."" But the lack of credit is hurtful, of course. ""It's always exciting to see Indian crafts make it to international mood boards, but what's disheartening is when they're showcased without context. Borrowing art forms is part of global fashion's evolution, but not acknowledging their roots is where it becomes problematic. We've seen this pattern before, where rich, centuries-old crafts are reimagined by luxury houses without so much as a mention of their origin, legacy, or the hands that shaped them,"" says Aparajita. ""Kolhapuris carry the weight of heritage, of artisan communities, of regional identity. Showcasing them without the right narrative does a disservice to the very essence of what makes them iconic,"" adds the designer. ""We've seen this before, moments where Indian art and craft are borrowed, styled into seasonal collections, and then left behind until the next revival. But what's hopeful now is a growing consciousness, a shift from consumption to conversation, from appropriation to appreciation. Where is it headed? Hopefully, towards deeper storytelling, sustained recognition, and a place in fashion that isn't just seasonal, but sacred,"" Toor signs off.

A symbol of heritage, skill, and storytelling, passed down through generations of master artisans."" The Kolhapuri's moment on the global stage is a reflection of rich artistic lineage, says Toor. ""Its silhouette speaks of timeless design, while its making reflects the kind of craftsmanship that the world is only now beginning to truly value."" But the lack of credit is hurtful, of course. ""It's always exciting to see Indian crafts make it to international mood boards, but what's disheartening is when they're showcased without context. Borrowing art forms is part of global fashion's evolution, but not acknowledging their roots is where it becomes problematic. We've seen this pattern before, where rich, centuries-old crafts are reimagined by luxury houses without so much as a mention of their origin, legacy, or the hands that shaped them,"" says Aparajita. ""Kolhapuris carry the weight of heritage, of artisan communities, of regional identity. Showcasing them without the right narrative does a disservice to the very essence of what makes them iconic,"" adds the designer. ""We've seen this before, moments where Indian art and craft are borrowed, styled into seasonal collections, and then left behind until the next revival. But what's hopeful now is a growing consciousness, a shift from consumption to conversation, from appropriation to appreciation. Where is it headed? Hopefully, towards deeper storytelling, sustained recognition, and a place in fashion that isn't just seasonal, but sacred,"" Toor signs off.

mov_93AAAC404957914D1575440370731693,"‚Äâ ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Atlanta rapper Young Thug's attorney has filed a motion Monday seeking to modify his famous client's sentencing. Brian Steel filed the motion in Fulton County Superior Court, a motion that seeks a hearing on his request to modify Young Thug's sentencing in Atlanta's trial of the 21st century. It is not known what the modifications will be. On May 9, 2022, Young Thug and 27 other suspected criminal gang members were arrested in Buckhead on several organized crime, weapons and drug-related charges. Fulton County prosecutors accused Jeffery Williams - Young Thug's real name - was the head of an organized criminal gang known as YSL, which they said stood for Young Slime Life. Defense attorneys maintained the crew was part of a legitimate non-criminal record label, known as Young Stoner Life. Young Thug himself was facing eight criminal counts under a federal law that was originally enacted to fight organized crime. He was also charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, possession of codeine with intent to distribute, possession of cocaine, possession of a firearm and possession of a machine gun. In a trial that broke Georgia records for the longest jury selection and the longest criminal trial itself, Young Thug took a non-negotiated plea deal on Oct. 31, 2024, in which he was sentenced to 40 years, with five years to serve in jail. His sentence was commuted to the time he had already served behind bars, which led to his release from jail not long after taking the plea deal. Most recently, Steel was part of a so-called legal ‚Äúdream team‚Äù that represented Sean ‚ÄúDiddy‚Äù Combs, who was found not guilty earlier this month on one count of racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking by a Manhattan jury. But the jury did find Combs guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, a violation of the Mann Act, which could still lead to prison time. The overall verdict is broadly considered a victory for Combs.

Filmed during the TFWA Asia Pacific Exhibition in Singapore (12-16 May), Abia speaks to The Moodie Davitt Report Brands Director Hannah Tan from the group's striking pavilion, which showcased its shoppertainment approach to beauty retail. According to Abia, this is driven by a major shift in shopper preferences with 47% of Gen Z and Millennial shoppers looking for immersive experiences when they travel.

The space brought together 22 luxury beauty brands from the L'Or√©al Travel Retail Asia Pacific¬†portfolio, including Lanc√¥me, YSL Beauty, SkinCeuticals, Prada Beauty, Aesop and K√©rastase. In the compelling video interview, Abia outlines how the beauty powerhouse is responding to the changing dynamics of travel retail post-COVID, particularly the growing demand for experiential retail and sustainable products. (Above and below) L'Or√©al shoppertainment experiences offer an elevated sense of service through personalised rituals and product recommendations as emphasised by the Lanc√¥me Absolue facial at the TFWA Asia Pacific show He says, ‚ÄúThe L'Or√©al Pavilion is a real statement of how strongly we believe in the strategic value of this channel. It's also an opportunity to share our vision of shoppertainment and how we want to make airports places of excitement. ‚ÄúTo do that, we need to reinvent the ecosystem of partnerships we have with our stakeholders. This is what we call Pentarchy. In our booth you can explore a variety of experiences that reflect what our vision of airport beauty retail can look like. ‚ÄúAt the stand, we have a pampering experience with Lanc√¥me Absolu for visitors with time to spare,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúAt the entrance, there's a quick beauty fix ‚Äì ideal for quick skincare or makeup touch-ups. We're also targeting men, which is why we've created a lifestyle and grooming area where travellers can enjoy a cocktail, get a haircut, listen to music and work.‚Äù Men are a big focus for the company in 2025. Pictured above is Abia experiencing the hydrafacial at the SkinCeuticals pop-up at Singapore Changi Airport.

Click here for an exclusive interview with L'Or√©al Travel Retail Chief Sustainability Officer Laurence Pardieu-Duthil about the #JoinTheRefillMovement campaign Abia highlights the group's recent experiential activations, such as the YSL Beauty Light Club and SkinCeuticals' first aesthetic skincare outpost in Changi as well as exclusive cross-category collaborations, such as Lanc√¥me x Monopoly, as examples of shoppertainment-focused campaigns brought to life by Pentarchy partnerships. He says, ‚ÄúThe market has radically changed. We're seeing more Gen Z, more Millennials and more travellers from emerging markets. But across all of them, there's one key trend: 47% are looking for immersive experiences when they travel. ‚ÄúWe see this as a huge opportunity, particularly because our fundamentals are strong. Appetite for travel is stronger than ever, and the appetite for beauty remains equally strong. This is why L'Or√©al Travel Retail is bringing all these new experiences to life.‚Äù Additionally, Abia discusses the group's ongoing sustainability efforts, including its recent #JoinTheRefillMovement campaign for World Refill Day (16 June). #JoinTheRefillMovement is the group's first global multi-brand, multi-category and multi-channel refill campaign. The initiative aimed to drive consumer adoption of refillable beauty products by positioning refills as a new beauty ritual and a meaningful step towards greater sustainability. Abia says, ‚Äú74% of travellers say they are looking for sustainable offers. We believe this is a fantastic opportunity as our refills offer great value to our customers. By the end of this year, almost a third of our catalogue will offer refillable options, such as Kiehl's. It's good for the planet and good for consumers' pockets.‚Äù L'Or√©al highlighted the 'Beauty Shopper-tainment of the Future' concept at the TFWA Asia Pacific Exhibition, where this interview was filmed.

Offering a final message to the industry, Abia says: ‚ÄúWe must always stay ahead of the game and continue to pioneer ‚Äì something we've shown with our recent activations and collaborations. Second, partnership is key and we have talked a lot about Pentarchy, which is the future of partnerships in this channel. I believe we can keep working together, and not in silos, to create value in our ecosystem. ‚ÄúFinally, it's about people‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúTravel retail is about unique people and we need to bring back this travel retail DNA that is about agility, an entrepreneurial mindset and a spirit of conquest.‚Äù ‚úà Pioneering activations, Pentarchy partnerships and people are at the heart of L'Or√©al's strategy, Abia says","[embedded content] [embedded content] ‚ÄúWe must stay ahead of the game and continue to pioneer.‚Äù So says L'Or√©al Travel Retail Asia Pacific Managing Director Jes√∫s Abia as he shares the beauty leader's ambitious vision for the future of airport retail in this engaging video interview.

It's also an opportunity to share our vision of shoppertainment and how we want to make airports places of excitement. ‚ÄúTo do that, we need to reinvent the ecosystem of partnerships we have with our stakeholders. This is what we call Pentarchy. In our booth you can explore a variety of experiences that reflect what our vision of airport beauty retail can look like. ‚ÄúAt the stand, we have a pampering experience with Lanc√¥me Absolu for visitors with time to spare,‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúAt the entrance, there's a quick beauty fix ‚Äì ideal for quick skincare or makeup touch-ups. We're also targeting men, which is why we've created a lifestyle and grooming area where travellers can enjoy a cocktail, get a haircut, listen to music and work.‚Äù Men are a big focus for the company in 2025. Pictured above is Abia experiencing the hydrafacial at the SkinCeuticals pop-up at Singapore Changi Airport. Below is the L'Or√©al Paris Men Expert Lounge at the Singapore show which offered grooming services alongside fragrance-inspired cocktails. Click here for an exclusive interview with L'Or√©al Travel Retail Chief Sustainability Officer Laurence Pardieu-Duthil about the campaign Abia highlights the group's recent experiential activations, such as the YSL Beauty Light Club and SkinCeuticals' first aesthetic skincare outpost in Changi as well as exclusive cross-category collaborations, such as Lanc√¥me x Monopoly, as examples of shoppertainment-focused campaigns brought to life by Pentarchy partnerships. He says, ‚ÄúThe market has radically changed. We're seeing more Gen Z, more Millennials and more travellers from emerging markets. But across all of them, there's one key trend: 47% are looking for immersive experiences when they travel. ‚ÄúWe see this as a huge opportunity, particularly because our fundamentals are strong. Appetite for travel is stronger than ever, and the appetite for beauty remains equally strong. This is why L'Or√©al Travel Retail is bringing all these new experiences to life.‚Äù Additionally, Abia discusses the group's ongoing sustainability efforts, including its recent campaign for World Refill Day (16 June). is the group's first global multi-brand, multi-category and multi-channel refill campaign. The initiative aimed to drive consumer adoption of refillable beauty products by positioning refills as a new beauty ritual and a meaningful step towards greater sustainability. Abia says, ‚Äú74% of travellers say they are looking for sustainable offers. We believe this is a fantastic opportunity as our refills offer great value to our customers. By the end of this year, almost a third of our catalogue will offer refillable options, such as Kiehl's. It's good for the planet and good for consumers' pockets.‚Äù L'Or√©al highlighted the 'Beauty Shopper-tainment of the Future' concept at the TFWA Asia Pacific Exhibition, where this interview was filmed. Click here for our full story on the experiential showcase. Offering a final message to the industry, Abia says: ‚ÄúWe must always stay ahead of the game and continue to pioneer ‚Äì something we've shown with our recent activations and collaborations. Second, partnership is key and we have talked a lot about Pentarchy, which is the future of partnerships in this channel. I believe we can keep working together, and not in silos, to create value in our ecosystem. ‚ÄúFinally, it's about people‚Äù he adds. ‚ÄúTravel retail is about unique people and we need to bring back this travel retail DNA that is about agility, an entrepreneurial mindset and a spirit of conquest.‚Äù Pioneering activations, Pentarchy partnerships and people are at the heart of L'Or√©al's strategy, Abia says",2025-07-08 07:49:02,en,WEB,JoinTheRefillMovement|JoinTheRefillMovement|JoinTheRefillMovement,,‚úà,,1,False,True,"The content specifically mentions YSL Beauty as one of the luxury beauty brands in L'Or√©al's Travel Retail Asia Pacific portfolio, discussing their experiential marketing strategies and brand activations like the YSL Beauty Light Club.

According to a report WSBTV's Michael Seiden in Atlanta posted on Monday night, May 9, Young Thug was arrested and booked at the Fulton County Jail. He's being held on charges of conspiracy to violate the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act (RICO) and participation in criminal street gang activity. A photo of Young Thug being arrested as well as the rapper's mugshot has also surfaced. He will have his first court appearance on Tuesday at 11:30 a.m. According to the 88-page indictment, Young Thug, born Jeffery Lamar Williams, reportedly stands accused of renting a 2014 Infiniti Q50 Sedan from Hertz, which was used to carry out the murder of Donovan Thomas, Jr., who is a rival gang member, back on January 10, 2015. The rapper also is reportedly accused of giving YSL associates Christian Eppinger and Antonio Sumlin the green light to pull off a second attempt at murdering rapper YFN Lucci while he's in Fulton County Jail. Meanwhile, Gunna, born Sergio Giavanni Kitchens, is reportedly facing one count of conspiracy to violate RICO. Gunna stands accused of appearing in a music video for Lil Keed's 2020 song ‚ÄúFox 5"" while wearing a ‚ÄúYSL‚Äù pendant and a ‚ÄúSlatt‚Äù pendant. As far as the other members, prosecutors allege that ‚ÄúYSL is a criminal street gang that started in late 2012 in the Cleveland Avenue area of ATL.

We've all been on the fitness tracker train for a while, using them to supercharge our sleep, track our cycles and monitor our stress. But when I learned of the Oura Ring, ridding me of the bulky watch-style band that spoils my seamless summer tan, I was sold. The wearable health monitor, the first model of which was launched all the way back in 2015, is designed to 'paint a truly holistic picture of your health' by monitoring your sleep, activity, stress, heart health, and hormonal cycle 24/7, before providing personalised insights and recommendations. The fact that it leans into the chunky jewellery trend, while also mimicking the classic wedding band? An added bonus, enjoyed by celebs including Kim Kardashian, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston and Mark Zuckerberg.

Arguably, the Oura Ring is one of the most sophisticated wellbeing monitors to date, measuring more than 20 biometrics that all directly impact how you feel, including heart rate variability (HRV), blood oxygen levels and temperature. For those concerned about accuracy, the finger actually provides the most accurate reading of your heart rate, blood oxygen levels and temperature. Plus, the brand's ongoing testing has measured the device to have a 79% sleep tracking accuracy, compared to clinical polysomnography at 83%. Need a tad more convincing? It also reported a 98% heart rate variability accuracy when compared to ECG2. Wondering how exactly it measures those metrics, though? Through a quartet of monitors: Red and infrared LEDsMeasure blood oxygen levels while you sleep.Green and infrared LEDsAlternate to measure heart rate and heart rate variability 24/7 and respiration rate during your sleep.Digital sensorMeasures your temperature variations.AccelerometerTracks movement and activity 24/7. But because a load of numbers and percentages aren't hugely helpful to those without a doctorate, it then shares its findings via the clear and concise Oura app in easy-to-digest graphics tables. This does mean you will need to sign up for an Oura Ring membership, but for just ¬£5.99 a month or ¬£69.99 a year, you'll also get tailored recommendations on how to up your scores. What are the differences between the Oura Ring Gen3 and the Oura Ring 4? First, the design and material. While the previous model had a titanium exterior surrounding an epoxy interior, the new iteration is made from lightweight, durable titanium the entire way through. The latter also comes fitted with recessed sensors, aiding a more comfortable fit and improved tracking. Talking of, the accuracy of the Oura Ring 4 is powered by Smart Sensing that dynamically selects the optimal signal path. In terms of battery life, designers claimed the Gen3 could last a whole seven days, while you now get up to eight days of uninterrupted tracking per charge with the 4. How we test the Oura Ring 4: Georgia Trodd wearing the Oura Ring 4 in gold. It's no secret that GLAMOUR editors often moonlight as testing guinea pigs. Over 12 weeks, various team members were asked to call into question the many claims made by the Oura Ring design team and consider the following: Ease of use ‚Äî Was the app intuitive to use, and were your results easy to understand? Design ‚Äî Did the ring feel big, bulky, heavy or get in the way? Any signs of wear and tear after 12 weeks? Waterproof ‚Äî Any issues when worn in the bath, shower or while getting sweaty in the gym? Effectiveness ‚Äî Did the personalised insights and recommendations make a difference to your health and/or wellbeing? Oura Ring 4: The Verdict We're still very much in the honeymoon period of our health tracking ‚Äî AKA Oura needs a few more weeks of data to properly notice any patterns. However, our team of testers have pulled together a list of perks so far. There were no complaints in terms of comfort, many commenting how they forgot they were even wearing it, most days. And the response was the same when it came to design ‚Äî many complimented how seamlessly it sat alongside their jewellery. One did point out that the gold is a little more yellow than most gold-plated bracelets and rings on the high street, but this is barely noticeable from a distance. ProsConsBattery lasts up to eight days, depending on activity level, and recharges super quickly in under two hours.There can be some tracking teething issues in those first few months ‚Äî for example, mis-reading drying your hair as a workout.Offers you trends over time, giving you daily, weekly and monthly calendar views of your key body metrics.Rest Mode automatically switches on when Oura detects that your body might be under stress.Super aesthetic and plenty of colour options.

Through a quartet of monitors: Red and infrared LEDsMeasure blood oxygen levels while you sleep.Green and infrared LEDsAlternate to measure heart rate and heart rate variability 24/7 and respiration rate during your sleep.Digital sensorMeasures your temperature variations.AccelerometerTracks movement and activity 24/7. But because a load of numbers and percentages aren't hugely helpful to those without a doctorate, it then shares its findings via the clear and concise Oura app in easy-to-digest graphics tables. This does mean you will need to sign up for an Oura Ring membership, but for just ¬£5.99 a month or ¬£69.99 a year, you'll also get tailored recommendations on how to up your scores. What are the differences between the Oura Ring Gen3 and the Oura Ring 4? First, the design and material. While the previous model had a titanium exterior surrounding an epoxy interior, the new iteration is made from lightweight, durable titanium the entire way through. The latter also comes fitted with recessed sensors, aiding a more comfortable fit and improved tracking. Talking of, the accuracy of the Oura Ring 4 is powered by Smart Sensing that dynamically selects the optimal signal path. In terms of battery life, designers claimed the Gen3 could last a whole seven days, while you now get up to eight days of uninterrupted tracking per charge with the 4. How we test the Oura Ring 4: Georgia Trodd wearing the Oura Ring 4 in gold. It's no secret that GLAMOUR editors often moonlight as testing guinea pigs. Over 12 weeks, various team members were asked to call into question the many claims made by the Oura Ring design team and consider the following: Ease of use ‚Äî Was the app intuitive to use, and were your results easy to understand? Design ‚Äî Did the ring feel big, bulky, heavy or get in the way? Any signs of wear and tear after 12 weeks? Waterproof ‚Äî Any issues when worn in the bath, shower or while getting sweaty in the gym? Effectiveness ‚Äî Did the personalised insights and recommendations make a difference to your health and/or wellbeing? Oura Ring 4: The Verdict We're still very much in the honeymoon period of our health tracking ‚Äî AKA Oura needs a few more weeks of data to properly notice any patterns. However, our team of testers have pulled together a list of perks so far. There were no complaints in terms of comfort, many commenting how they forgot they were even wearing it, most days. And the response was the same when it came to design ‚Äî many complimented how seamlessly it sat alongside their jewellery. One did point out that the gold is a little more yellow than most gold-plated bracelets and rings on the high street, but this is barely noticeable from a distance. ProsConsBattery lasts up to eight days, depending on activity level, and recharges super quickly in under two hours.There can be some tracking teething issues in those first few months ‚Äî for example, mis-reading drying your hair as a workout.Offers you trends over time, giving you daily, weekly and monthly calendar views of your key body metrics.Rest Mode automatically switches on when Oura detects that your body might be under stress.Super aesthetic and plenty of colour options. Choose from: silver, brushed silver, stealth, black, gold and rose gold....",2025-07-09 08:10:38,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,False,"The text is entirely about the Oura Ring health tracker and does not mention YSL (Yves Saint Laurent) at all.

But what's even better? Finding it on sale. Enter Amazon Prime Day 2025. Running from 8-11 July, we're now on day two of the retailer's annual mega-sale, and it's still bursting with beauty deals ‚Äì but the fragrance section is the true hidden gem. Think: YSL Black Opium, Gucci Bloom, Chlo√© Eau de Parfum, and Jean Paul Gaultier's Scandal ‚Äì all at prices that feel almost too good to be true. Whether you're stocking up on an everyday spritz, investing in something sensual for evenings out, or gift-hunting for the impossible-to-buy-for, this is the moment to strike. And with savings across eau de parfums, colognes, aftershaves, and cult-favourite body mists, it's never been easier to find your perfect match ‚Äì or to switch things up entirely. Below, we've rounded up the best Amazon Prime Day perfume deals for 2025, with picks from fragrance houses we know and love. The best part? They're all GLAMOUR editor-approved. STORY LAST UPDATED WEDNESDAY 9th JULY 10:50AM. Your Amazon Prime Day perfume deals FAQs, answered: When is Amazon Prime Day? What is Amazon Prime Day? How can I take part in Amazon Prime Day 2025? How we choose the best Amazon Prime Day fragrance deals The best Amazon Prime Day fragrances, reviewed How we choose the best Amazon Prime Day fragrance deals As a commerce writer for GLAMOUR, I spend an unreasonable amount of time scrolling through new fragrance launches, sifting through price drops, and mentally categorising every scent I spritz. So when it comes to Prime Day, I'm only interested in sharing the deals that are actually worth your attention. GLAMOUR's Lian Brooks testing perfumes ahead of Amazon Prime Day. GLAMOUR's Sophie Cockett testing perfumes ahead of Amazon Prime Day. I've handpicked these perfume offers based on a few non-negotiables: genuine savings, cult-status bottles, and scents I'd happily recommend to a friend or wear myself. Some are timeless bestsellers (hello, Daisy Marc Jacobs), others are underrated gems that deserve more air time. I've also kept different tastes and budgets in mind, from delicate florals to deep musks, lightweight body mists to full-bodied parfums. Whether you're loyal to a signature scent or on the hunt for something new, these are the deals I'd bookmark, spritz, and stock up on. Ahead, the top Amazon Prime Day perfume deals of 2025‚Ä¶ 1/27 Best Prime Day fragrance deal Ghost Deep Night Eau De Toilette Why we love it: This fragrance begins with alluring top notes of Indian rose and belle de nuit flower, which bloom and release their scent exclusively at night. And with 69% of savings for Prime Day, it's a steal. 2/27 Best Daisy fragrance Daisy Marc Jacobs EDT 50ml Why we love it: If you're looking for a fresh and feminine fragrance, look no further than the cult-favourite classic that is Daisy By Marc Jacobs. This floral eau de toilette spray features notes of violet, strawberry, grapefruit and gardenia, making it a perfect summertime scent. 3/27 Best celebrity scent Ariana Grande Cloud EDP Spray Why we love it: Ariana Grande Cloud is one of the most-complimented perfumes that you can get your hands on. The best part? It's just been reduced, courtesy of Amazon Prime Day. Even years after its initial release date, Ari's perfume is still a best-seller that we know and love. Our very own writer and expert on all things perfume associates the fragrance with ""warm, slightly undercooked, doughy waffles.‚Äù An absolute must-buy. 4/27...",2025-07-09 10:12:44,en,WEB,,,,,1,False,True,"The comment specifically mentions YSL Black Opium as one of the featured fragrances in the Amazon Prime Day deals, directly discussing the brand's perfume in the context of its fragrance category.

Learn more Tom Ford's perfumes have developed a cult following, with a stamp of approval from celebrities like Taylor Swift and Harry Styles. Tom Ford's Lost Cherry fragrance is TikTok's latest obsession, and maybe you've already caught a whiff of the delicious and romantic scent. With notes of cherry, almond, cinnamon, rose, jasmine and plum‚Äîthe scent is sweet, fresh and addictive. But a whopping $405 price tag makes it less accessible for those on a budget. That's whereDossier's Ambery Cherry perfume comes in. Beauty enthusiasts on Reddit called it first: Dossier's Ambery Cherry fragrance smells eerily similar to Tom Ford Lost Cherry's moody and sweet tones, but without the luxury markup. And it's on sale for Amazon's Prime Day sale. The 50-mL bottle of Dossier's Ambery Cherry is now available for just $39.20 on Amazon, as a result of the Prime Day Deal. Reviews of Dossier's Ambery Cherry perfume On Amazon, the scent has earned 4.2 stars out of 5, and continues to earn high praise‚Äîwith over 600 reviews confirming the hype is worth it. One says: ‚ÄúSmells just like the original, if not better.‚Äù A second one says, ‚ÄúThis is my everyday go-to. It's not a sickly sweet cherry scent, it's very sophisticated.‚Äù Another fan on Reddit states, ‚ÄúIt has a sweet, sexy, and mature cherry-almond-vanilla scent that just smells amazing.‚Äù The perfume lives up to Dossier's motto, 'Everyone deserves to smell like luxury'. Dossier's Ambery Cherry scent has also made waves on TikTok, with a user claiming that ‚Äúit lasts all day‚Äù and another one adding ‚ÄúSmells identical to Tom Ford's Lost Cherry‚Äù, and ""Bout as close as you can get to Mr. Ford's scent."" However, in contrast, some reviewers said that the fragrance doesn't last as long, ""but for the price is a definite buy if you like the cherry smell"". Another review criticized the packaging of the product, stating that it came out ""leaking/damaged inside box"", but that it was ""good value for money and lasted a few hours but not all day"". The vegan and paraben-free smell uses sustainable, non-toxic ingredients and is now on sale for Prime Day‚Äîa perfect addition to your summer beauty routine. The perfume is also sourced from Grasse, France, the perfume capital of the world. Amazon offers a wide range of similar Dossier fragrances inspired by the scents of high-end brands, such as the Ambery Vanilla inspired by YSL's Black Opium, and Ambery Saffron inspired by Baccarat Rouge 540 by Maison Francis Kurkdjian.

I try to be an encouraging voice to cancel out the toxic conversations we grew up with around women and aging, especially those I absorbed as a teenager in the Y2K era. When people call me an influencer, sometimes I wonder‚Äîdo they mean blogger, or do they mean someone who's online and influencing perspectives, skincare routines, that sort of thing? I think the word influence is powerful, and that role has evolved so much. Now, people want storytelling. They want to feel like they know you. I first started making content when I was around 30 or 31, and I was immediately seen as 'someone older.' It was the era of Addison Rae and Charli D'Amelio, so I get it. But that positioning actually helped me. People started coming to me for nostalgia and advice. I try to take the stance of your favorite coworker trying to help you out. I know a lot of people say 'big sister,' but I have actual siblings who don't ask me for advice. [Laughs] It's funny because when people started seeing me as a voice of reason, I had never been one in my life. I'm just someone who made mistakes, learned from them, and is now telling everyone. Like, I'm the kind of girl who goes to a gray-looking buffet, gets a stomach virus, and then tells everyone, Don't go to that buffet. I never thought this would be my career. But I started gaining followers, and then someone from InStyle reached out and asked me to interview for a position helping build their TikTok presence. I thought it was spam, but we were in quarantine, and I figured I had nothing to lose, so I took the call. They offered me the job immediately. At the time, I was in a relationship and something really interesting was happening: I didn't care if people wanted to fuck me; I didn't care if people found me attractive; I didn't care if people thought I was cringey. I already had someone. And that lack of self-consciousness gave me the freedom to really be myself online. It was the perfect storm that helped me grow a following‚Äîand from there, the career grew. Suddenly I was getting asked to do red carpets. Now, I'm also writing an advice column for The Cut. I never want my advice to come from a place of shame‚Äîjust from experience. Like, maybe don't kiss someone else when you're 19 and already have a boyfriend because maybe you won't feel great about it the next day. And I'm launching Tefi Talks, a topical weekly pop culture podcast, with Vox. The girls don't have anything to listen to on the subway anymore. There are a lot of surprises in store, but I can't reveal too much‚Äîyet. BEAUTY My mom and my grandma were beauty girls. I look at pictures of my mom, and she was eating these bitches up. She had a Madonna gap and brow, black hair, blue eyes, a naturally tan sort of bitch. If anything, she would accentuate her beauty. She would fluff up her eyebrows. I never heard her talk about her body. She only ever said to me, 'Have you seen your body? You're beautiful.' But we'd sit and look at tabloids together‚ÄîI remember asking her what cunnilingus was because she was reading Cosmo and it came up in a column‚Äîand I started to absorb the way the media talked about celebrity bodies. Then I'd turn on the TV and hear stories like how Nicole Richie supposedly had a Memorial Day party with a scale at the door, and if you weighed over 100 pounds, you weren't allowed in. Because I'm Latin and American, it felt like I had to choose between being Sofia Vergara or Paris Hilton. Over time, I realized I had to let go of a certain idea of femininity, and that maybe people don't need to be beautiful to be interesting. And all that brain space and energy? It could've gone to so many other things. SKINCARE I used to think you had to shock your skin into behaving, but moisturizing, using sunscreen, and the PanOxyl wash with 10% benzoyl peroxide are the best things to keep my skin in check.

Azzaro wanted EDP - Found it very generic like first an alcohol blast then aromatic and woody scent. 1 million edt - This one I have at him and at my home version didnt had any alcohol blast just a genuine spicy start but at SS there was a strong alcohol blast and then it followed its dry down which was amber and some spicy notes too. Dylan blue - This one had the strongest alcohol blast and like it settled after 25 mins and then I found some citruses and fresh notes in it. Found it very generic to be honest Skin raww - Didnt had any alcohol blast at start had some good fresh vibe but it faded very soon JPG Le male Le parfum - At start could smell some spicy notes and then it vanilla scent and it was quite pleasant. Valentino donna born in roma edp - Yes, its a feminine scent and no alcohol blast at all in the start it was fruity and a bit floral and woody and then after 1 hour it became more floral and vanilla scent. Ysl y - I could smell a prominent note of ginger and citruses and spicy but on fresher side and it was great to be honest but found it too generic. Nautica Voyage - It was like a fresh scent but faded too fast or maybe after smelling so many scents I couldnt smell this one. CDNIM PP - I applied it and smelled strong pungent smell of something like I dont even know what smell was it and like didnt like it. After trying designer fragrances , I must say that middle eastern perfumes are great value to money and have very increased respect for them. P.S - It was just my experience, it could be anything like testers having bad batch or anything, dont hate me for this.","So I went to SS today and tried multiple perfumes.

The ‚Äúone of those things‚Äù being: having your exposed foot stepped on in public or being the person to do the stepping. Everyone, at some point in their lives, has been on both sides of the equation. Today, Angela was on the side of being stepped on. And, in a fashion typical of the universe remarking ‚Äúyou should have stayed home,‚Äù it had been ages since the last time she had dared to go out. As in out out, like for a ‚Äúla-di-da‚Äù reason as opposed to a must-get-more-groceries-from-just-down-the-block in order to survive reason. This was a quick reminder, as far as Angela was concerned, about why you should never, ever leave the house unless it was absolutely, positively necessary. No matter what the ‚Äúhome invasion‚Äù genre of movies tries to impart‚Äîwhich is the idea that shit can be terrible and horrifying anywhere, even (and sometimes especially) in your own home. But Angela would take being tortured by an intruding stranger inside her apartment any day of the week over being tortured by an intruding stranger in public. Which is exactly what happened to her as she rode the metro toward Od√©on, not really sure why, just drawn to it because the stop got into her head. Not the location, but the stop name itself. She was coming from the more banal S√©gur area, which, while not as teeming with tourists, wasn't really teeming with much of anything apart from residences. So yes, she had made the mistake of telling herself that she ought to go to a more ‚Äúpopulated‚Äù area. ‚ÄúSee the sights.‚Äù As though she hadn't seen them all after eleven years of living in Paris. And yet, to someone on the outside looking in, they might take her occasional flicker of ‚Äúfaith in communing with the world around her‚Äù as a positive sign. A sign that she was still capable of bothering. Yet every time she did, it sent her back into her lair for at least a month. Such was the grace afforded to her by her profession as the head of graphic design for an ‚Äúethical‚Äù hair care company that didn't notice if she came into the office or not. All they were interested in was her timely assignation and delivery of the necessary labels and promotional materials. Thus, she was that rare breed who could not only afford to be a shut-in, but to be one in a luxurious manner. Complete with a De'Longhi espresso machine that she counted as her most prized (and most used) possession. And maybe she had hopped herself up on one too many espressos before leaving, therefore made herself even more prone to being hyper-aware of all the fuckery around her. Alas, the one thing that happened too quickly for her to be hyper-aware of was getting her big toe stepped on by some brown-haired woman wearing headphones, white shorts and a tailored black vest (featuring four decorative silver-tone buttons) with nothing underneath it. A ‚Äúsummer chic‚Äù look that confirmed to Angela that the woman was a bona fide Parisian and not a tourist. This should have endeared Angela more to her, but the woman was clearly feeling herself a little too much, which made her careless act less forgivable. Because, as far as Angela could tell, she was distracted by her own reflection in the window of the metro as she started to rise up and inch her way out of the four-seat area, not looking at what was right in front of her as she careened into the main aisle. Angela, situated in the seat closest to said aisle, thought she had moved far enough out of the way to avoid this woman falling right into her lap. But no, that wasn't entirely the case as she felt, out of nowhere, the full weight of this woman's body on her right big toe. And while, sure, the woman was an expected Parisian waif, even waifs can feel heavy when a single big toe is suddenly tasked with ‚Äúupholding‚Äù them. It was the nail of Angela's big toe in particular that was forced against its will to bear the brunt of the waif's mass, which was rounded out by high heels. Angela let out a faint cry of pain in response, but only a faint one. She was still the sort of person to show restraint in a public setting no matter how bad something hurt (physically or emotionally). Yet, despite her demure reaction, Angela was horrified to find that the waif wanted to make a ‚Äúbig thing‚Äù about it. Loudly apologizing and asking if Angela was okay. This, to her, was even more affronting than if she had just ignored what she had done altogether and walked away. In fact, that would have been preferable to calling all this attention to what she'd done. Making Angela's injury, so to speak, all about her. As though she needed the rest of the train to know that she was a good person. The type of person who would never do such a thing maliciously. Because, in this life, it seems that people are still na√Øve enough to believe that ‚Äúintent‚Äù (or lack thereof) makes all the difference. But regardless of intent, it doesn't change the outcome, which, in this scenario, was to get a black and blue (with a dash of purple) toe. The waif wouldn't see the final result of her ‚Äúinnocent‚Äù action though. All she would see was someone ‚Äúrude‚Äù in Angela. Someone who could barely mutter a ‚Äú√ßa va‚Äù to absolve her of her crime. And it was a crime. To be so clumsy, so cavalier. Then again, Angela had never felt that way when she was the stepper in the permutation. And oh, how she had stepped on other people in her day....","It was one of those things where you could empathize with either side of the story, depending on the position you were in. Or had been in.

Wystarczy jedna warstwa, ≈ºeby podkre≈õliƒá rzƒôsy na lekki makija≈º do pracy czy szko≈Çy, a dwie-trzy dynamiczne warstwy zamieniƒÖ spojrzenie w hipnotyzujƒÖce ‚Äì idealne na wiecz√≥r czy randkƒô. Dodatkowy plus? Ten tusz do rzƒôs nie kruszy siƒô, nie odbija na powiece i nie tworzy efektu pandy, nawet po kilku godzinach. To sprawia, ≈ºe makija≈º wyglƒÖda ≈õwie≈ºo od rana do wieczora, bez potrzeby poprawek. A gdy przychodzi czas na demakija≈º ‚Äì schodzi bez walki. Je≈õli rzƒôsy majƒÖ wyglƒÖdaƒá tak, jakby codziennie zajmowa≈Ç siƒô nimi profesjonalista, a przy okazji portfel ma nie cierpieƒá ‚Äì ten tusz to totalny must-have. I teraz jest idealny moment, ≈ºeby go przetestowaƒá. [Promocja, kt√≥rej nie warto przegapiƒá] W regularnej cenie ten tusz i tak jest wart swojej ceny, ale 46,99 z≈Ç w Rossmannie to ≈õwietna okazja. Szczeg√≥lnie ≈ºe wiele os√≥b por√≥wnuje efekt, jaki daje L'Or√©al Paris Volume Million Lashes So Couture, do dro≈ºszych tusz√≥w za ponad 100 z≈Ç. Je≈õli wiƒôc chodzi ci po g≈Çowie zakup luksusowego tuszu, ale bud≈ºet nie pozwala na Lanc√¥me czy YSL, to w≈Ça≈õnie ten zamiennik z Rossmanna mo≈ºe uratowaƒá sytuacjƒô ‚Äì i portfel. Nie do≈õƒá, ≈ºe daje spektakularny efekt, to jeszcze jest ≈Çatwo dostƒôpny ‚Äì wystarczy skoczyƒá do najbli≈ºszej drogerii albo kliknƒÖƒá online, zanim promocja siƒô sko≈Ñczy.
