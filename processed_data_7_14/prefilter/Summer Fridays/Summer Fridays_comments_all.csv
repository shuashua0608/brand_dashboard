A lil' polar bear hydrating eye stick for some sweet, sweet relief when you wake up with puffy, aching eyes. This formula is blended with Iceland glacial water to help tighten skin and tackle dark circles so you look and feel more ~refreshed~. Promising review: ""I have always had serious dark circles and bags under my eyes and this has really changed this for me. The results are incredible. The puffiness is gone. The dark circles are hardly noticeable. My sensitive skin has not broken out. I never write reviews, but this was so good that I had to write a review. This actually works."" —Ben Get it from Amazon for $9.85 (available in six styles). 2. McCormick's ""I'm A Total Spud"" Potato Topping Seasoning you should try if you're not afraid to get a little feral about your air-fried, mashed, and baked potatoes — this blend of salt, garlic, and asiago cheese is so mouthwateringly delicious that you'll be dumping it on everything from popcorn to grilled cheese to guacamole. Promising review: ""I literally had to run to the store and get mashed potatoes so my son could have this again versus ice cream. It's so well done. I'm a sous chef and this is a go to now for home cooking. Love it."" —Brandon Get it from Amazon for $4.98 (available in three variations). 3. A limited edition (!!) Eos Marshmallow ""Super Balm"" lip treatment from the brand's ""secret menu"" so good that reviewers say it's better than Carmex for healing and better than Summer Fridays for quality. Lip care that also tastes like you're perpetually eating a s'more for less than $5?? My friends, life is good. Check out a TikTok of the marshmallow lip treatment in action. Promising review: ""My new must-have! My number one go-to for healing lips was Carmex. This beat it. I love the consistency (very creamy/smooth), it's not heavily flavored or goopy, and it obviously smells amazing. It isn't overbearing and also doesn't keep coating your mouth like the Eos stick balms (still great, but more wax)."" —Breanah Shirazi Get ti from Amazon for $4.99 (also available in Strawberry Acai). 4. A ""Penny the Penguin"" silicone measuring cup designed with an easy grip, an even easier spout pour, and a design so adorable that you'll bake yourself out of house and home just for an excuse to use her. This is a new product from the iconic Ototo quirky kitchen line, responsible for other beloved gems like the Nessie Ladle and Crab Spoon Rest! Get it from Amazon for $10.46 (clip the 30% off coupon on the product page for this price). 5. Patchology's ""Rosé Toes"" moisturizing foot mask to give your dry, cracked heels some shea butter, strawberry oil-infused relief in ten minutes flat — not unlike the glass of rosé that hits at Friday happy hour. Reviewers are genuinely impressed by how much of a difference these make in so little time! Patchology is a small business that specializes in themed beauty products. Promising review: ""Super hydrating for my feet! You can usually see when my feet are dry, but when I use this, they stay hydrated for a week after use! Love these!"" —Michelle Get it from Amazon for $10. 6. An adorable little puppy night-light with a soft white glow that makes it the perfect critter for gently illuminating bedrooms and bathrooms at night. It even has eight different color modes so you can finally live your childhood dream of having a purple dog!...","No point in being boring when you can used *whipped* sunscreen and cat-shaped sponges instead. 1.

But maybe a little autobiography won't hurt if it's only me who reads it. I am 18(F). And I do not have any will to live anymore. I just had a fight with my mother. And Honestly this was my last straw. Since childhood. My family had named me the angry child, expensive child, narcissistic, God complex, fat, selfish Yara Yara. Now I dont want to potray them the bad way. My parents atleast, they are nice, they call me talented and maybe where proud of me at moments, but obviously they don't want to feed my ego. I was bullied since the age of maybe 7-9 till my teen hoods, by my friends. Bags and bottles broken, called stuffs and rumours here and there. Never really hurt me in a way although I did start self harm and I did try to self exit back than. I remember one time, a boy called me names, and it hurt me alot so I cried in shower,  when my parents found out they were mad at me and asked me ""do you like him? Why would you cry over thay?"" I used to be good at studies, I used to play guitar, do art, sing even got a certificate for 7 years of classical dancing. I have Two bunnies I adore alot and 3 dogs i love more than my life although at this point i love anything more than my life and a cat who's the only thing that's stopping me from cutting my throat open.

One reviewer went so far as to call it ""heaven in a bag!"" Read more about how an epsom salt soak or bath can help with stress and muscle relaxation at Cleveland Clinic. Promising review: ""I bought this product hoping for a fresh, divine scent, and wow, it completely blew me away! I'm usually not one to purchase scented products without smelling them first, but I took a leap of faith and it paid off. Hawaiian Bliss is everything I hoped for and more. The scent is absolutely heavenly; rejuvenating, relaxing, and somehow energizing at the same time. After using it, I feel calmer, refreshed, and even a little happier. I genuinely look forward to using it. I'm already planning to order more, not just for myself but to include in gift baskets for friends and family. If you're on the fence, go for it. Highly recommend!"" —K. Marie Price: $5.97 2. A limited edition (!!)

Moroccanoil's Mini Must-Haves Sampler, which is so affordable that I'm not not pinching myself to make sure I'm awake. Reviewers especially love these teensy versions for traveling in ~luxury~ on the cheap, and for trying these beloved splurgeworthy products without committing to the whole price first!

Start with KIKI'S unmistakable vibe, music that pulses till 3AM, sunsets that demand an extra spritz, and a crowd that knows their angles. Then fold in Sage's kitchen magic, flame-licked meats, Mediterranean flavours, and table spreads that feel like a well-fed fever dream. The result: KIKI'S Sage: where you brunch, barbecue, boogie, and barely remember what day it is. Speaking of days, this isn't your average beachfront shuffle. With a weekly calendar of four anchor event nights and 35 distinct experiences, KIKI'S Sage is clocking in like a party factory with better lighting. -  Wednesdays are for karaoke heroes. No shame, all falsetto. - Thursdays get groovy with live music and a signature set menu—dinner and a show, done right. - Fridays hit hard with Human Figures events powered by ByGanz. (Translation: don't make Saturday plans.) - Saturdays keep it family-friendly and fire-fed with open-flame BBQs, DJs, and a buffet that says come hungry or don't come at all.

Opening Aquarelle Baris Koroglu, an owner of this new luxuriously appointed East Village spot, is serving a European take on seafood, with dishes like fluke crudo with blood orange, scallops spiced with piri piri, branzino with Meyer lemon, and salt-baked red snapper with herbs and olive oil. It pays to note that the stoves stay lit until midnight for that restorative lobster pasta with heirloom tomatoes before you call it a night. 47 Avenue B (East Fourth Street), aquarellenyc.com. The Paris Café Originally founded in 1873, this restaurant, a testament to the significance of the South Street Seaport, has been lovingly restored. It's also proof that the current appeal of foie gras terrine, snails, onion soup and steak frites is not new. The food is by Benjamin Wolff who worked at Racines NY, pastries are by Emma Scanlon, and the entire project is the work of Julien Legeard, the founder of Legeard Studio and Opus Hospitality, with a deep bow to the history of the place. (Opens Thursday) 119 South Street (Peck Slip), 646-386-7038, pariscafenyc.com. Sailor's Choice This outdoor dining venue in Hudson Yards is from Alex and Miles Pincus of Grand Banks in Manhattan and Pilot in Brooklyn, pierside restaurants on vintage boats. The centerpiece for this summer's 200-seat sprawl is an old Hinkley lobster boat; the menu's mostly East Coast seafood lists oysters, fish and chips and a lobster BLT. Public Square and Gardens at Hudson Yards, 350 11th Avenue (West 30th Street), crew.fun Tourmaline Previously, a dinner prepared by the chef Yvan Lemoine, a Food Network celeb, could be arranged only by booking My Kitchen, the catering company he owns with his wife, Rebecca Sussman. Now, from Wednesdays through Fridays, the venue becomes this intimate French American restaurant with a leafy garden lounge. Among Mr. Lemoine's specialties is classic pressed duck with cherries ($225 for two), a rare tour de force (pun intended) finished tableside in a silver duck press. 106-17 Metropolitan Avenue (Ascan Avenue), Forest Hills, Queens, 646-535-5799, tourmalinenyc.com. Lucky Charlie The restaurateurs Nino Coniglio and Drew Toresco have opened a pizzeria and Sicilian restaurant in a location that has one of the oldest coal ovens in the country. Exposed brick, vintage photos and leather upholstery evoke an era when coal-oven pizza was the coin of the realm for proper cheese-and-tomato pies. 254 Irving Avenue (Menahan Street), Bushwick, Brooklyn, 718-954-7184, no website. Dolores Emir Dupeyron grew up in Mexico City and now, with his wife, Cressida Greening, he's bringing childhood memories to the table. The couple also owns Winona's nearby. Bar food like guacamole, sopes con picadillo, papadilla (potato quesadilla), and chicharrones can accompany an agave drink from a list by Leanne Favre, also a partner, who was at Leyenda. Tacos, plates of meatballs, enchiladas and fried red snapper round out the menu. (Wednesday) 397 Tompkins Avenue (Jefferson Avenue), Bedford-Stuyvesant, Brooklyn, doloresbk.com, no phone. Hundredfold Brasserie A shopping and dining enclave at the western edge of Nassau County adjacent to the Belmont racetrack is home to the chef Timothy Hollingsworth's first New York-area restaurant.

mov_159254586D8E1176EF2609924F3B9C5D,"  The Contenders is a midweek column that looks at artists aiming for the top of the Billboard charts, and the strategies behind their efforts. This week, for the upcoming Billboard 200 dated July 12, we look at a loaded week of new and surging releases, headlined by returning alt-pop star Lorde and what's quickly becoming the summer's hottest movie soundtrack. Lorde, Virgin (Republic): One of the most anticipated pop releases of the summer has certainly been Lorde's fourth album Virgin, her first full-length since 2021's polarizing Solar Power. The album came with an extensive rollout, led by first single “What Was That” — which was debuted at a stop-start live event in New York's Washington Square Park (filmed for the song's official video, released later that week) and which became her first Billboard Hot 100 top 40 hit of the 2020s, bowing at No. 36. That song fell off the Hot 100 after just a few weeks, and none of the other tracks released in advance of Virgin followed it onto the chart — and the set has only 11 tracks and no feature appearances — so it's unlikely to be a streaming blockbuster, though it should still perform respectably on DSPs. It's also expected to sell well, helped by its availability for purchase in eight vinyl variants, including two signed editions — as well as being available on CD and for digital download. (The early critical response for Virgin has also been much stronger than the relatively mixed reception for Solar Power.) It should be enough to continue Lorde's streak of each of her studio albums making the Billboard 200's top five, and may better the No. 5 debut of Solar Power. It's unlikely to give her a second No. 1 album on the chart, however — following the No. 1 bow of Melodrama in 2017 — as Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem continues to be an absolute streaming juggernaut, set to score a seventh consecutive week of six-digit units on the chart. KPop Demon Hunters Soundtrack (Republic): The greatest potential obstacle to Lorde's path to a No. 2 debut on the Billboard 200 may come from another Republic release, and one far fewer would have tabbed as such a charts contender. KPop Demon Hunters, the animated Netflix musical set in the Korean pop world, has become such a sensation since its release two Fridays ago (June 20) that its soundtrack — featuring the songs of its two primary fictional groups, HUNTR/X and Saja Boys, as well as a couple contributions from real-life K-pop stars TWICE — appears on its way to being one of the summer's biggest hits. The rising soundtrack already debuted on the Billboard 200 dated July 5 at No. 8, making it the first soundtrack to reach the chart's top 10 since Ariana Grande & Cynthia Erivo's Wicked accompanying set in January. And the set is still growing, up 220% in streams over the first four days of this tracking week (June 27-30), as its songs continue to scale the DSPs' daily charts — with the soundtrack now occupying five of the top 15 spots on Spotify's Daily Top Songs USA listing, and seven of the top 25. If the set continues to grow on streaming, it could not only crash the Billboard 200's top five next week, it could challenge Virgin for the chart's runner-up spot. And the album doesn't even have a physical release yet — it's only available for streaming and digital purchase at the moment — so if Republic could get a physical soundtrack together to tap into K-pop fans' investment in tangible products, the sky is the limit for KPop Demon Hunters' commercial potential. KATSEYE, Beautiful Chaos (Hybe UMG/Geffen): Speaking of K-pop — one of the biggest stories in the genre this year is of the global outfit KATSEYE, which encompasses members from not just Korea but the Philippines, Switzerland and the U.S., and sings in multiple languages, despite largely working within a K-pop framework. The group's approach has generated much discussion within various pop communities, and also a couple crossover hits: The group's singles “Gabriela” (No. 94) and “Gnarly” (No. 98) can both be found on this week's Hot 100. More in Entertainment Both those singles can also be found on the sextet's second EP, Beautiful Chaos. The five-track set contains contributions from behind-the-scenes stateside pop fixtures like Andrew Watt and Justin Tranter, and comes with a surfeit of physical options for purchase — including four vinyl variants and nine CD variants. It might not be enough to compete with the streaming power of KPop Demon Hunters on next week's Billboard 200, but it should be enough to further cement KATSEYE as a burgeoning force on the charts. IN THE MIX Russ, W!LD (Diemon): Billboard's 2025 Indie Trailblazer returned on Friday (June 27) with new set W!LD, follow-up to 2023's No. 12-debuting Santiago. The album should also be ticketed for a top 20 debut, as the 19-track collection has yet to produce any obvious breakout hits, but Russ' selling power remains considerable for an independent rapper — and W!LD is available for purchase in multiple vinyl, CD and cassette variants, some of which are signed. Barbra Streisand, The Secret of Life: Partners, Vol. 2 (Columbia): Barbra Streisand is one of the legends of the Billboard 200, having topped the chart a staggering 11 times in her career, ranging from 1964's People to 2016's Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway. Streisand's latest Partners duets set is unlikely to make it an even dozen, but should attract interest with its star-studded guest list — including modern-day chart-toppers Ariana Grande, Sam Smith and Hozier, as well as all-time legends like Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney and Mariah Carey — and is available for sale in a pair of vinyl variants, as well as on CD.","The Contenders is a midweek column that looks at artists aiming for the top of the Billboard charts, and the strategies behind their efforts.

mov_D00F83CA901BBEFFD66D30DCDA038FF1,"  Art After Dark returns to downtown Waynesville with a new look and feel 6-9 p.m. this Friday, July 4, thanks to a grassroots effort led by merchants to expand and rebrand the popular downtown gallery stroll. Since the Downtown Waynesville Commission cut ties to the event earlier this year, two merchants have led the charge to save the event and make it more inclusive of all downtown Waynesville businesses. For 25 years, Art After Dark has invited locals and visitors to explore Main Street through its art galleries on the first Fridays of summer months, but the tradition was at risk of disappearing this year. ""We have removed ourselves from the say of whether the event happens and how it happens. We will support it, but we are not going to be in charge,"" DWC Director Beth Gilmore told downtown merchants during a meeting in January. Jerry Jackson, owner of Salmagundi Gallery, and Tiffani Watts, manager of Twigs and Leaves, took up the reins and began steering Art After Dark in a more inclusive direction. ""Art After Dark was going to fall off the radar if someone didn't do something, so Jerry and I got together and said we're going to save this and make it better, taking in things we had heard from people downtown,"" Watts said. Merchants and galleries rallied in response to take ownership of the event, which provides a boost to downtown shops and restaurants. While the arts will still anchor the monthly event, the new vision also emphasizes Waynesville's food and beverage scene, retail shops, galleries and music venues. ""Years ago there were 15 to 18 galleries in town and it was much easier to say 'Hey, we're doing an art stroll that's more related to galleries,'"" Jackson said. ""There's so few (galleries) at this point that that's just not feasible, but there's enough businesses to make it a good experience."" Ideally, Jackson said, the event will draw people to town for more than just a stroll down Main Street. He and Watts are working to engage as many downtown merchants as possible to offer dinner and shopping options in conjunction with Art After Dark, and they hope visitors may even be encouraged to stay overnight to participate in any of the area's many attractions and events. ""The more people that are open, the more enjoyable downtown is, the more people want to come and stay longer,"" Watts said. But, that collaboration is only possible if merchants feel heard and supported. That's why Watts and Jackson have held listening sessions and other meetings with merchants to understand their needs and concerns. So far, their engagement efforts seem to be paying off. ""A lot of people have been excited - they felt like nobody had ever really asked them to be a part of it,"" Jackson added. The event scored a $10,000 grant from the Haywood County Tourism Development Authority to rebrand and promote it. A website and social media accounts are being created to promote monthly activities, including artist demonstrations, live music, drink or dinner specials, and other promotions from participating merchants.

Since the Downtown Waynesville Commission cut ties to the event earlier this year, two merchants have led the charge to save the event and make it more inclusive of all downtown Waynesville businesses. For 25 years, Art After Dark has invited locals and visitors to explore Main Street through its art galleries on the first Fridays of summer months, but the tradition was at risk of disappearing this year. ""We have removed ourselves from the say of whether the event happens and how it happens. We will support it, but we are not going to be in charge,"" DWC Director Beth Gilmore told downtown merchants during a meeting in January. Jerry Jackson, owner of Salmagundi Gallery, and Tiffani Watts, manager of Twigs and Leaves, took up the reins and began steering Art After Dark in a more inclusive direction. ""Art After Dark was going to fall off the radar if someone didn't do something, so Jerry and I got together and said we're going to save this and make it better, taking in things we had heard from people downtown,"" Watts said. Merchants and galleries rallied in response to take ownership of the event, which provides a boost to downtown shops and restaurants. While the arts will still anchor the monthly event, the new vision also emphasizes Waynesville's food and beverage scene, retail shops, galleries and music venues. ""Years ago there were 15 to 18 galleries in town and it was much easier to say 'Hey, we're doing an art stroll that's more related to galleries,'"" Jackson said. ""There's so few (galleries) at this point that that's just not feasible, but there's enough businesses to make it a good experience."" Ideally, Jackson said, the event will draw people to town for more than just a stroll down Main Street. He and Watts are working to engage as many downtown merchants as possible to offer dinner and shopping options in conjunction with Art After Dark, and they hope visitors may even be encouraged to stay overnight to participate in any of the area's many attractions and events. ""The more people that are open, the more enjoyable downtown is, the more people want to come and stay longer,"" Watts said. But, that collaboration is only possible if merchants feel heard and supported. That's why Watts and Jackson have held listening sessions and other meetings with merchants to understand their needs and concerns. So far, their engagement efforts seem to be paying off. ""A lot of people have been excited - they felt like nobody had ever really asked them to be a part of it,"" Jackson added. The event scored a $10,000 grant from the Haywood County Tourism Development Authority to rebrand and promote it. A website and social media accounts are being created to promote monthly activities, including artist demonstrations, live music, drink or dinner specials, and other promotions from participating merchants.

Dubai's new shorter work week will now involve all government workers, who will be divided into two groups. The first will work eight hours per day, but get Fridays completely off. The second will still work for 4.5 hours on Friday, but will only need to be on for seven hours on other days. SEE ALSO: Microsoft Japan's 4-day work week boosted productivity by 40 percent Such changes will be in effect from July 1 to September 12, at which point Dubai's government workers will presumably be obliged to return to their usual five-day schedules. The four-day work week is part of Dubai's 2025 Our Flexible Summer initiative. You May Also Like ""This initiative demonstrates our firm commitment to enhancing the government work environment, making it more adaptable and responsive to the needs of employees and the community,"" said Abdullah Ali bin Zayed Al Falasi, director general of the Dubai government's human resources department.

Dubai's four-day work week follows a trial it conducted in 2024 involving 21 government entities. This experiment resulted in overall employee satisfaction increasing by 98 percent, with workers experiencing enhanced productivity and happiness. Yet despite these results, as well as positive outcomes from previous experiments by other organisations, it seems Dubai's government still isn't quite ready to commit to a more permanent change.

Companies which have tried it include Microsoft Japan, which announced in 2019 that its four-day work week trial had increased productivity by 40 percent. New Zealand firm Perpetual Guardian saw productivity increase by 20 percent during their own trial, prompting them to switch to a permanent four-day work week in 2018. Both organisations saw savings in reduced electricity costs as well. Iceland ran a four-day work week trial between from 2015 to 2019, and found that the almost 3,000 workers involved were happier, healthier, and more productive. A similar 2022 UK trial produced favourable results as well, with the overwhelming majority of participating organisations still operating on a four-day work week one year after the study's publication. Belgium also approved a four-day work week in 2022, enabling workers to request longer 10-hour days in exchange for one day off, while Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic introduced an optional four-day work week. Yet despite years of trials spanning the globe, resulting in mountains of evidence demonstrating benefits to employers as well as employees, the four-day work week still remains a rare model.

Whether it's for the Curried Goat, Cow Foot Soup, Jerk Chicken Bites or Spicy Shrimp, more and more people are walking in the doors at the SaYum Jamaican Restaurant in Wilson. “Over the past 14 years, SaYum has gone to another level,” said Michael Bell, executive director of the St. John Community Development Corporation. The restaurant is operated in one of seven street-level retail units in the St. John CDC Wilson Renaissance Center housed in a redevelopment project across from the G.K. Butterfield Train Station. “We get a lot of traffic from the train station,” said Bell, who immigrated from Jamaica to Wilson in 2004. Most of the recipes prepared at the restaurant are taken from Bell's mother's cookbook. Armaleta “Pearl” Bell, was from Jamaica and died on Aug. 1, 2005, at the age of 67 in Royal Palm Beach, Florida. She was the inspiration for two books on Jamaican cooking through her association with Island Records. “My mother cooked for the Queen of England, the Duke of Edinburgh, Mick Jagger, Bob Marley, Grace Jones, Kool and the Gang,” Bell said proudly. Aliah M. Bell, 18, Michael Bell's granddaughter and a worker at SaYum Jamaican Restaurant, never had a chance to meet her great-grandmother. But there is a drawing of Pearl Bell outside Aliah's room at home. “She was very beautiful, I think,” Aliah said. “Every time I come out of my room, she's right there.” Now Aliah is spreading her family's Jamaican heritage through the food served at SaYum. “Just being able to meet her through her food since they are her recipes, I really like that because she cooked for a lot of people,” Aliah said. Now it is Aliah who is spreading her family's Jamaican heritage through the food served at SaYum. “It's truly awesome, especially seeing all of the personalities coming through from the train station,” Aliah said. “It is really a good spot. There are so many cultures that come in here just to try the food. Everybody comes in throughout the day.” Aliah said folks respond positively about the food, which is often spiced with fresh ginger, curry, garlic and turmeric. The meals are served with onions, beans, peas, beans, rice and cabbage and dressed with plantains and carrots and potatoes “It depends on if people want something spicy or mild,” Aliah said. Whatever the level of heat, the restaurant offers a wide variety of cool beverages made with pineapple, mango, orange, lime, lemon and other tropical delights. The restaurant serves something for everyone, even vegetarian dishes. “There is nothing like the bread when it comes out of the oven,” Aliah said. Some folks just stop by for ice cream to take the heat off a blazing afternoon.

Noble Harvest Farm owners Linda and Trent McNair first opened their farm to the public in 2020, in the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, to provide a space for friends and neighbors to gather outdoors. Since then, community members and visitors from the Bay Area and beyond have flocked to this small batch grosso lavender farm each summer to enjoy the calming effect of the blooming flowers with friends and family. At the start of each you-pick session, before visitors head out into the rows of flowers, Trent McNair teaches visitors the finer points of harvesting bunches of the green and purple plant, such as not cutting too low on the plant's stem.

I find that it's more gentle and cleansing without any weird film left behind. I hope they never discontinue this line because I love it!"" —D Get it from Amazon for $9.99. 2. A two-in-one nausea relief inhaler designed to work FAST on spontaneous nausea, motion sickness, morning sickness, and general queasiness (having a human body is hard). You can either use it as a scent inhaler or rub it directly on the tip of your nose for relief. Promising review: ""Took this on my first cruise.

Nigerian Dinner     If you fancy a spicy evening meal of freshly cooked Nigerian food — great news! African Meal Palace is now open at Mint Lane Café four nights a week, bringing the vibrant flavours of West Africa to Lincoln. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, and the food is simply fantastic. Behind the dishes is Kemisola Obafemi, a Lincoln resident who brings her love of cooking and community together in a unique and heartfelt way. Kemi, who moved to Lincoln with her husband and children in 2022, is passionate about colourful, nourishing food that tells a story. “It all starts with a desire to share,” Kemi says with a big smile. “It began with inviting friends and neighbours over for dinner. I don't know how to cook small portions!” she laughs. “So they said — why not share this amazing food with everyone?” Now supporting her family's food venture, Kemi helps prepare a wide variety of traditional dishes that might be new to British palates — such as catfish pepper soup, yam porridge, Ofada rice (a traditional Nigerian rice), pounded yam with egusi soup, ogbono soup, bitter leaf soup, and dishes made with fermented locust beans. Some of the meals pack a fiery punch, but there are also milder options like jollof rice for those less familiar with spicy cuisine. Many of the ingredients are sourced locally through AdeLincoln on the High Street, while others are brought in directly from Africa to ensure authenticity and the perfect taste. African Meal Palace is open at Mint Lane Café on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, from 4pm to 8pm — and everyone is welcome to experience this rich culinary culture. “The food is nice,” says Kemi. “And I just love seeing people enjoy it!” African Meal Palace is open at Mint Lane Cafe on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, 4-8pm - all welcome!

This year alone, the iconic brand has plans to close more than 125 stores across 18 states. And it appears that even more closures are on the horizon. According to the company's plan, there are still upwards of 70 stores that are potentially slated for closure. While the company has no drastic changes currently in mind for its online business, this might be the beginning of the end when it comes to brick-and-mortar Macy's stores.

In January 2025, the fabric and craft store Joann filed for bankruptcy for the second time in a year. They first filed in March 2024, but they went private and were able to keep all of their stores open. Not this time, however. Joann will be closing 500 of its 800 stores. Court documents show that all 50 states will be affected. The company blames its recent problems on unexpected inventory issues and is looking for a new buyer. Jo-Ann Fabric actually had a pretty good last few years. With more people staying at home than usual, it was the perfect time to pick up a new craft, and many of those aspiring DIY-ers headed to their local Jo-Ann's to pick up the supplies they needed to create something beautiful. However, as things return to normal, the craft supply giant has been struggling. So far, it's been reported that Jo-Ann Fabric will close at least eight stores in 2023. While that doesn't sound like a lot, there's talk that this is just the beginning of the company's problems and that they may be on the road to bankruptcy. The drug store chain Rite Aid has been struggling quite a bit in the last few years. In 2022 alone, the business closed more than 140 stores nationwide. However, this doesn't seem like it was enough to help keep the chain afloat, and even more closures are expected in 2023. According to the company's CFO Matt Schroeder, the 2022 closures did help reduce costs for the company, so they plan on continuing that trend. That's not great news for people who shop or work at the affected Rite Aid stores! We'll just have to wait and see how many stores get the axe this year.

Stay up to date on Lower Columbia news, wherever you go Access the latest Lower Columbia news in The Daily News app that lets you select the topics that matter most to you. The June 20 event was cancelled because teens had been diving in the pool, which is too shallow to do so safely, and disregarding instructions from lifeguards the week before. ""People say there's nothing for kids to do, so we're trying really hard to provide a safe and supervised space for healthy physical activities,"" Manny said. Staff spoke to participants before the June 27 teen night, which did not have the same issues, she said. Due to the holiday, there was no teen night held Friday. The weekly events, held on Fridays, give teens a chance to swim, play basketball, eat pizza and play board games. Between 30 and 60 teens attend each week. At 60 participants, the teen nights are at capacity for the current number of volunteers, Manny said. ""We're not really looking to grow it,"" she said. Putting the events on costs around $1,500 per month, Manny said. The program is funded by grants from local organizations like United Way of Cowlitz and Wahkiakum Counties and partially run by volunteers. The front desk staff and lifeguards are paid YMCA employees. Manny said the YMCA planned to cancel the event last summer because there were other activities available, but the teens who attended requested that it continue.

mov_9077C9B20EEC5A9205F24C3DFF1668DA,"  “It's just too much, isn't it?” says Julie, a retiree in Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, about the 42C (107.6F) heat that her brother had seen scorch Spain last week. The former local government worker has felt summers get hotter over her lifetime and says she “couldn't stand” such high heat herself. But like many who experienced Europe's first heatwave of the summer, Julie does not sound overly alarmed. She worries about climate breakdown for young people, but is not concerned about herself. She thinks more climate action would be nice, but does not know what can be done about it. She does not have much faith in the government. “It's like everything else,” she says. “I think it's all too little, too late.” As heatwaves engulfed large swathes of Europe and North America last week – the latest in a stream of deadly extremes made worse by fossil fuel pollution – green groups are frustrated that increasingly violent weather has not spurred the urgent support for climate action they had expected. Governments across the rich world continue to roll back policies to stop the planet from heating, while far-right parties that deny climate science lash out at environment rules even as disasters unfold. Their voters, while rarely climate deniers themselves, seem to tolerate their energetic attacks on environmental policy, if not support them. The views of someone like Julie – who declined to reveal her voting preference – sounded similar to what was seen across the country, said Ed Hodgson, an analyst at the research group More in Common who has run focus groups on climate action. Spectators at the Wimbledon tennis tournament in London try to cool down on Tuesday. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters Polls taken over the second-last weekend of June show most people in the UK found the previous week of weather too hot, are worried it will get hotter, and hold the climate crisis at least partly responsible. But the nonprofit also found the share of people concerned about climate change has fallen over the past year, dipping from 68% to 60%. Support for the UK's target to hit net zero emissions by 2050 fell even further, plunging from 62% to 46%. “The issue is really that there are so many other concerns now,” said Hodgson, citing the organisation's data tracking the top issues that people face each week. “Three years ago you'd have the cost of living first, then the National Health Service, and then immigration and climate – those two would compete for third place. Now, when we do those polls, climate is near the bottom of the list.” The contradictions are visible in towns such as Stanford-le-Hope, where Julie lives, which is among the few already represented in parliament by the rightwing populist Reform UK. A YouGov poll last month found just over half of Reform voters wanted a heatwave in the coming weeks. The party, which has promised to scrap the net zero target and “unlock Britain's vast oil and gas reserves”, is projected to win eight of the 10 most flood-prone constituencies at the next general election, according to an analysis in May by the NGO Global Witness and Round Our Way, a campaign group. Far-right parties across mainland Europe have been even more vocal in using the heatwave to take aim at climate policy, even as blazing wildfires force thousands to flee their homes and doctors warn of widespread excess deaths. Firefighters battle flames during wildfires on the Greek island of Crete on Friday. Photograph: Xinhua/Shutterstock In Spain, where the current heatwave brought a record June temperature of 46C, the Vox leader, Santiago Abascal, mocked a government promise to regulate fear-based advertising by asking if they were also going to “ban the propaganda of climate religion”. In Italy, which has limited outdoor work during the hottest parts of the day in most of the country, the Lega party MP Claudio Borghi said: “Climate change has always existed, the causes are anything but clear, and the solutions are contrary to what … is correct.” The planet's most important stories.

The post took a swipe at the World Economic Forum, the German public broadcaster and the Green party. The biggest political row over the heat erupted in France, where the National Rally figurehead, Marine Le Pen, called for a “major” air conditioning plan – one week after the party failed in its parliamentary push to halt new wind and solar projects. In an opinion article in Le Figaro on Thursday, the interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, a conservative, called to stop support for renewable energy and expand France's nuclear energy sector. Young girls pour water on their heads as temperatures exceed 40C in Berlin. Photograph: Maryam Majd/ The proposal earned rebukes from the ecology minister, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, who described it as “petty politics” that would write Algeria a check for oil, and the former prime minister Gabriel Attal, who called it an “incomprehensible” misstep. “As we endure several days of an unprecedented heatwave, we are witnessing a troubling resurgence of anti-science scepticism,” he said. Some far-right parties have focused their attention on old-school climate denial, while others have moved from questioning the science to aggressively campaigning against solutions. “I don't think the extreme heat is being weaponised, but the efforts to limit it certainly are,” said Ciarán Cuffe, a co-chair of the European Green party and former Irish environment minister. He added that Le Pen's call for more air conditioning – which he said should be one solution among many – may even represent a shift in strategy. “It's a recognition that these heatwaves are happening, and that they are extreme.” The paradox is that far-right parties bashing green rules are polling well above 20% in several European countries, even though the share of people who deny climate science is typically in single digits. In the UK, pollsters find just 6% of Reform voters list environmental policy as a reason for voting for the party, according to More in Common. That said, the level of threat perception among their voters is much higher than in other parties, said Hodgson....","“It's just too much, isn't it?” says Julie, a retiree in Stanford-le-Hope, Essex, about the 42C (107.6F) heat that her brother had seen scorch Spain last week. The former local government worker has felt summers get hotter over her lifetime and says she “couldn't stand” such high heat herself. But like many who experienced Europe's first heatwave of the summer, Julie does not sound overly alarmed. She worries about climate breakdown for young people, but is not concerned about herself. She thinks more climate action would be nice, but does not know what can be done about it. She does not have much faith in the government. “It's like everything else,” she says. “I think it's all too little, too late.” As heatwaves engulfed large swathes of Europe and North America last week – the latest in a stream of deadly extremes made worse by fossil fuel pollution – green groups are frustrated that increasingly violent weather has not spurred the urgent support for climate action they had expected. Governments across the rich world continue to roll back policies to stop the planet from heating, while far-right parties that deny climate science lash out at environment rules even as disasters unfold. Their voters, while rarely climate deniers themselves, seem to tolerate their energetic attacks on environmental policy, if not support them. The views of someone like Julie – who declined to reveal her voting preference – sounded similar to what was seen across the country, said Ed Hodgson, an analyst at the research group More in Common who has run focus groups on climate action. Spectators at the Wimbledon tennis tournament in London try to cool down on Tuesday. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters Polls taken over the second-last weekend of June show most people in the UK found the previous week of weather too hot, are worried it will get hotter, and hold the climate crisis at least partly responsible. But the nonprofit also found the share of people concerned about climate change has fallen over the past year, dipping from 68% to 60%. Support for the UK's target to hit net zero emissions by 2050 fell even further, plunging from 62% to 46%. “The issue is really that there are so many other concerns now,” said Hodgson, citing the organisation's data tracking the top issues that people face each week. “Three years ago you'd have the cost of living first, then the National Health Service, and then immigration and climate – those two would compete for third place. Now, when we do those polls, climate is near the bottom of the list.” The contradictions are visible in towns such as Stanford-le-Hope, where Julie lives, which is among the few already represented in parliament by the rightwing populist Reform UK. A YouGov poll last month found just over half of Reform voters wanted a heatwave in the coming weeks. The party, which has promised to scrap the net zero target and “unlock Britain's vast oil and gas reserves”, is projected to win eight of the 10 most flood-prone constituencies at the next general election, according to an analysis in May by the NGO Global Witness and Round Our Way, a campaign group. Far-right parties across mainland Europe have been even more vocal in using the heatwave to take aim at climate policy, even as blazing wildfires force thousands to flee their homes and doctors warn of widespread excess deaths. Firefighters battle flames during wildfires on the Greek island of Crete on Friday. Photograph: Xinhua/Shutterstock In Spain, where the current heatwave brought a record June temperature of 46C, the Vox leader, Santiago Abascal, mocked a government promise to regulate fear-based advertising by asking if they were also going to “ban the propaganda of climate religion”. In Italy, which has limited outdoor work during the hottest parts of the day in most of the country, the Lega party MP Claudio Borghi said: “Climate change has always existed, the causes are anything but clear, and the solutions are contrary to what … is correct.” The planet's most important stories.

The post took a swipe at the World Economic Forum, the German public broadcaster and the Green party. The biggest political row over the heat erupted in France, where the National Rally figurehead, Marine Le Pen, called for a “major” air conditioning plan – one week after the party failed in its parliamentary push to halt new wind and solar projects. In an opinion article in Le Figaro on Thursday, the interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, a conservative, called to stop support for renewable energy and expand France's nuclear energy sector. Young girls pour water on their heads as temperatures exceed 40C in Berlin. Photograph: Maryam Majd/ The proposal earned rebukes from the ecology minister, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, who described it as “petty politics” that would write Algeria a check for oil, and the former prime minister Gabriel Attal, who called it an “incomprehensible” misstep. “As we endure several days of an unprecedented heatwave, we are witnessing a troubling resurgence of anti-science scepticism,” he said. Some far-right parties have focused their attention on old-school climate denial, while others have moved from questioning the science to aggressively campaigning against solutions. “I don't think the extreme heat is being weaponised, but the efforts to limit it certainly are,” said Ciarán Cuffe, a co-chair of the European Green party and former Irish environment minister. He added that Le Pen's call for more air conditioning – which he said should be one solution among many – may even represent a shift in strategy. “It's a recognition that these heatwaves are happening, and that they are extreme.” The paradox is that far-right parties bashing green rules are polling well above 20% in several European countries, even though the share of people who deny climate science is typically in single digits. In the UK, pollsters find just 6% of Reform voters list environmental policy as a reason for voting for the party, according to More in Common.

Free By Jay Babcock Grand Royal Magazine No. 6 [1997] Lloyd Free was raised in housing projects in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn as part of a large family. He was a child of the streets, and so was his fame. Endless hours were spent on the playground courts made famous in this past summer's feature documentary <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjNCooPN7CA"">Soul in the Hole</a>, and Rick Telander's classic <a href=""https://amzn.to/405Dc70"">Heaven Is a Playground</a> (a chronicle of summer, 1974 at Foster Park in Bed-Stuy that remains essential to anyone was wants a better understanding of the inner city). In the streets, the best players had nicknames: Herman “the Helicopter,” Joe Hammond “the Damager,” “Fly” Williams. Lloyd's was “All-World.” Free made it to North Carolina's Guilford College, which he dropped out of after three years in 1976 to take a spot with the Philadelphia 76ers, just before Julius Erving arrived. Never a starter for the championship Sixers (who were overloaded with talent: Julius ""Dr. J"" Erving, Daryl “Chocolate Thunder” Dawkins, George McGinnis) but already infamous for his mouth and his predilection for shooting from anywhere at every opportunity. Free was traded to the struggling San Diego Clippers for basically nothing (a 1984 first-round draft pick, to be precise) after the end of the '77-78 season. Clippers coach Gene Shue let Free be free, and he finished second in scoring two years in a row behind George “the Ice Man” Gervin of San Antonio. Free was a sportswriter's wet dream, always eminently quotable and always opinionated: “That shot was so good, I thought I took it”; “I'm so good, even I can't stop me”; etc. Free had game too: flash, razzle-dazzle, jazz. He was a classic streak shooter capable of scoring 30 points in a half, a fan favorite, a short guy (6 foot 2½) with astounding vertical ability and a jump shot with such a high arc that it would leave the top edge of your TV screen—and then re-enter just in time to fall straight down into the basket, all net. While in San Diego. Free formed All-World Enterprises and opened a sporting goods store called The Free Throw. When Shue was fired, Free was traded to Golden State, where he had some success but was once again saddled with a team in the process of getting their shit together. ln any event, on December 8, 1981, Free went to a Brooklyn court and legally changed his first name from Lloyd to World. claiming that was what he was already being called anyway. When Free's career began to wane in the mid-80s, as he gained weight and his bricklaying increased, World ventured into the minor league United States Basketball League to get his game in order. He would emerge again to play successfully off the bench with Ralph Sampson and Akeem Olajuwon for the Houston Rockets in the '87-'88 season. Today World B.

A publicist confides that he's always ""on,"" and indeed, when Grand Royal caught up to him recently, World was good-natured, eager-to-please and, as always, couldn't be stopped. He speaks expressively in different voices and chuckles to himself, with a cadence and delivery that reminds one of prime Richard Pryor on good (read: no profanity) behavior.

Well, because tonight the sky was screaming again, and I don't like it when it does that. But the neighbors have been blowing off “bottles rockets” for days now… Usually, I love Fridays! It's my day to tell you all about my adventures, training wins, and Bear's latest grumbles. But today… things feel weird. Even Mommy said so. She's been quiet in that stormy-brain way all day, and the humans had that “big feelings” energy that makes me want to lean into them real close and put my head in their lap. We didn't go out and party, or wave flags, or say “Happy Birthday, America!” because… well, things aren't really worth celebrating right now. Mommy said that the president (who she called President… uh… Fluffup? Flopduck? I forget, I was distracted by Goldfish crackers) signed a bill that's going to hurt a lot of people like us- disabled people, sick people, people who already fight just to survive. I don't understand politics, but I do know how to recognize when the people I love are hurting. And today, that hurt was everywhere. So instead of fireworks and festivals, we had a quiet night at home. Bear and I got locked inside (RUDE) while Mommy, Mama the Moss Maiden, and our favorite Yard Yeti BJ played with sparklers outside. I saw them through the window, laughing just a little and trying so hard to make the night feel soft instead of needle-sharp. They needed it. I know they did. Dinner smelled amazing, by the way. Somebody super kind donated a steak to the food pantry, and Mommy made it fancy- with garlic and Worcestershire and lots of herbs. There were green beans from our garden (I helped water them and chase the bunnies away with Bear!) , buttery potatoes, zucchini, and mushrooms. We even got our own tiny bites of steak! But honestly? The best part wasn't the steak. It was the way Mommy and Mama and BJ sat at the table, leaning toward each other, smiling between the worry lines. I remember hearing Mommy talk about how she used to spend the Fourth of July once- about memories of summer nights on the lake. About Oma and Opa and fireworks that felt magical instead of dangerous. About a time when things made a little more sense. That's what we celebrated tonight- not the country, not the politics, not the broken promises. We celebrated each other. The family we've built out of pieces and pain and love. So, if you're out there feeling small or scared or angry- just like us- if the world feels too loud and unfair- you're not alone. Bear and I are right there with you, keeping watch, noses in the air, tails down but hearts strong. Stay inside. Stay safe. Don't let your hooman drink and drive. And please snuggle your pets. We need you just as much as you need us.

I don't understand politics, but I do know how to recognize when the people I love are hurting. And today, that hurt was everywhere. So instead of fireworks and festivals, we had a quiet night at home. Bear and I got locked inside (RUDE) while Mommy, Mama the Moss Maiden, and our favorite Yard Yeti BJ played with sparklers outside. I saw them through the window, laughing just a little and trying so hard to make the night feel soft instead of needle-sharp. They needed it. I know they did. Dinner smelled amazing, by the way. Somebody super kind donated a steak to the food pantry, and Mommy made it fancy- with garlic and Worcestershire and lots of herbs. There were green beans from our garden (I helped water them and chase the bunnies away with Bear!) , buttery potatoes, zucchini, and mushrooms. We even got our own tiny bites of steak! But honestly? The best part wasn't the steak. It was the way Mommy and Mama and BJ sat at the table, leaning toward each other, smiling between the worry lines. I remember hearing Mommy talk about how she used to spend the Fourth of July once- about memories of summer nights on the lake. About Oma and Opa and fireworks that felt magical instead of dangerous. About a time when things made a little more sense. That's what we celebrated tonight- not the country, not the politics, not the broken promises. We celebrated each other. The family we've built out of pieces and pain and love. So, if you're out there feeling small or scared or angry- just like us- if the world feels too loud and unfair- you're not alone. Bear and I are right there with you, keeping watch, noses in the air, tails down but hearts strong. Stay inside. Stay safe. Don't let your hooman drink and drive. And please snuggle your pets. We need you just as much as you need us.

mov_8472FC5471AE096A3F73313EB765CC3B,"  Many of us have enjoyed the attractions of North Wales' premier seaside town - but often when we were much younger. With the summer holidays coming up, I revisited Llandudno - dubbed the Queen of Welsh Resorts - to see whether they still have the same allure, and was pleasantly surprised. Llandudno has upwards of 2.8 million day visitors a year according to a Great British Tourism Survey from some time ago, giving the area a huge economic boost. On Tuesday morning, I started out at the Great Orme and drove to the summit car park. I intended to take a cable car ride but popped into the shop first for a mooch. Join the North Wales Live Whatsapp community now Biker seriously injured in Gwynedd crash with VW Transporter It has the usual fridge magnets and knicknacks but I was interested to see they sell a children's Fossil Dig Kit for £6.99, (marine invertebrate and coral fossils have been found in the carboniferious limestone hereabouts), a Llandudno seagull cuddly toy (£7.50) and mini bingo (£1.99) for the trip home. The adjoining summit cafe, with its hot buffet, was very popular. Then it was time to take a Great Orme cable car ride for the first time in years. You go around the back of the summit cafe and can buy a return ticket for £15 at a booth. Beware it's cash only though. Naturally, safety is crucial and aswell as a somewhat ambiguous sign warning customers ""Anyone standing up in the cable car may not return"", there were sandbags to weigh it down during the journey. With a gentle jolt, I was off, leaving behind the hubbub from the machinery. It's a nine-minute descent and I was impressed once again with the panoramic views of Llandudno Bay, Great Orme Country Park, disused quarries, St Tudno's Churchyard and Haulfre Gardens. The peacefulness and serenity were striking (I didn't look directly down), punctuated by an occasional, cheery ""Hello"" from the occupants of a passing cable car. I got off at the cable car station by Happy Valley (having to pay another 50p - not sure why) before walking around the building to get into another cable car for the returning ascent. I learnt there had been customers from Canada and Malaysia that day and I heard American, Irish and Brummie accents too. Clearly, Llandudno's cable cars are enduringly popular. On the way back to the summit car park I passed the Rocky Pines crazy golf course which I'd tried with the family years ago. It still looked fun and a woman was diligently hoovering the mini-fairways to keep them in tip-top condition. Next, I drove into town for a walk along Llandudno Pier - another attraction which has its seaside charms. I headed into the amusement arcade where I spent £1 at a machine to charge up a credit card-sized fun card. It paid for a chance to win a prize on a kind of mini-ferris wheel in a glass cabinet. There were Deadpool, Hello Kitty and Winnie the Pooh lamps but no joy, this time around. Wandering along the pier I was pleased to see a resurgent vinyl record stall - (Elvis Presley and Willie Nelson were among the artists), CDs and further along a Stormtrooper and Darth Vader figures. Of course, the squawking of seagulls is never far away in this town and at another kiosk fridge magnets proudly declared: ""I lost my sausage roll/donut/dignity to a seagull in Llandudno"". I thought I'd finish off with a lesser known attraction: Llandudno Chocolate Experience. I'd been here a while back but there is always more to learn. Customers get free chocolates of varying types - nutty, plain and milk etc - to be consumed at certain points on the trail to reflect how the taste of it developed. Display boards tell the story - ""Milk chocolate would not appear until after Henri Nestle invented powdered milk (in 1867) Daniel Peter worked out how to add it to chocolate."" And another board states: ""Chocolate was first officially sent as a gift during the Second Boer War to celebrate the New Year of 1901. Queen Victoria asked Cadbury's to make a chocolate bar for her soldiers, however this caused a problem. ""Cadbury's was a Quaker company and, as a result the owners were all pacifists. In the end they only branded the bars the Queen saw and the rest were totally unbranded."" The chocolate museum is open from 10am till 4pm Mondays to Fridays. (Admission up to £6.50). There's a factory beside the Llandudno Chocolate Experience and Paul Williams and the other staff are happy to explain to you about how chocolate is produced. It had been fun to revisit the attractions of yesteryear and to see they're still flourishing. The town holds happy memories for many and its enduring appeal is clearly attracting new generations of visitors too.","Many of us have enjoyed the attractions of North Wales' premier seaside town - but often when we were much younger.

mov_B480DDFB727A9773A84A322DD344A378,"  There's just something different about the way Sean Payton builds a team. It's not flashy. It's not numbers on a spreadsheet. It feels like it's written in ink, not in code. While some other front offices chase 40-yard dash times and TikTok clips, Payton chases the real football spirit. But why and where does it all start? Well, the answer is his High school! Like almost every football story. No stats. No stardom. Just belief. And somehow, that quiet chapter from a high school sideline still feels alive in the Broncos' locker room today. Still shaping the way his team is being built. To understand what Sean Payton really wants in his players, let's take a close look at the Broncos' NFL 2025 draft class. You'll notice a pattern. First-rounder Jahdae Barron from Texas. Second-round RB RJ Harvey out of UCF. Third-round WR Pat Bryant from Illinois. DE Sai'vion Jones (LSU), OLB Que Robinson (Alabama), P Jeremy Crawshaw (Florida), and TE Caleb Lohner (Utah). Seven picks, six of them stuck with one school their entire college career. No hopping around. No portal pit stops. Just loyalty! Why does it matter? Because in a college football world where over 4,000 players hit the transfer portal after the 2024 season, only 61%, per 2022 stats, find a new team. And that's why Sean Payton made a choice. He wants guys who stick it out. Who grind. As his old high school teammate Mark Bittner put it, Payton “like guys who didn't take the money and ran to another college as soon as they hit adversity.” That's not just a draft philosophy. That's his story. Benchwarmer. Backup. Underdog. Then starter. Then Super Bowl champ. And Denver walked the walk. PFF gave the Broncos high marks, especially for their Day 1 picks, and CBS Sports ranked their entire offseason fourth-best in the league. Deserved. Skipping through the shiny transfer names and betting on guys who stuck it out in college wasn't some dice roll, it was a very clearly laid out. A mindset. Less gamble, more gospel. The other offseason moves backed that same philosophy. Denver re-signed lineman Matt Peart, brought in running back J.K. Dobbins, added high-ceiling safety Talanoa Hufanga, and picked up tight end Evan Engram, who fits that reliable Drew Brees-era mold. None of it screams headline grab, and that's exactly the point. This team isn't chasing flash. It's stacking loyalty, toughness, and veterans who have been through it. This will make all the more sense when we dig into Sean Payton's high school roots. How Naperville Still Lives in Sean Payton's Coaching DNA We all know Sean as one of the most prominent football minds in the world....","There's just something different about the way Sean Payton builds a team.

CeraVe's Retinol Serum, which lives up to the CeraVe name and uses *encapsulated* retinol to reduce the appearance of scars and pores without flaking or redness. If you haven't gotten into retinoids yet or are worried about irritating your skin, this gentle but effective serum is a great option — and reviewers say they like it better than other more expensive options (like Murad's Retinol Serum, which retails for $92). And remember, like with any retinol (that actually works) *just do not use it every day. * Start slow and work yourself up if needed, paying attention to your skin. Promising review: ""I absolutely love this stuff! I saw a dermatologist on TikTok who raved about this product and tried it out, and it's been the most amazing stuff! It's helped my face to clear up very quickly removing all of the blemish spots and dark spots around my face. It's been one of the best products I've added to my face routine. This would be great for all ages/stages and for any weather types. It doesn't moisturize much, but that's not it's intention, and there is no scent, so I'd imagine it's great for all skin types and hypoallergenic."" —Successful Solo Promising review: ""I bought this for my teenager to use for his acne scars, but he ended up not using it. I ran out of my Murad retinol serum, so I gave this a try. I actually like it better than the Murad! It absorbs quickly, with zero smell or irritation.

Apply this as a luminous, blurring base, mix it with your moisturizer or foundation, or dot it over makeup as a natural-looking highlight. It's formulated with hyaluronic acid and squalene for a boost of hydration too! Promising review: ""This stuff is so legit I've gone through three bottles. Adds the perfect glow to your skin! Sometimes I use it under foundation, and sometimes, I use it solo with a bit of concealer. I will never not repurchase it for the price and how beautifully it sits on the skin. This stuff is viral for a reason!!"" —mapagill Promising review: ""If you like Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Filter, this is leaps and bounds better! Just buy it.

mov_FBA4E9A4C5612F0BD3429ABC545CF02A,"  Amazon's four-day Prime Day sales event is expected to drive a record $23.8 billion in U.S. e-commerce sales this week, according to a forecast released today by Adobe. The sales will take place not only on Amazon, but on other e-commerce sites, large and small, as competing retailers join in on what has become one of the biggest sales event of the year. “Two Black Fridays” Worth Of Spending Adobe expects the spending over the event, which was expanded from two days to four this year, to be equivalent to two Black Fridays, in terms of online spending. Last year, consumers spent $10.8 billion on U.S. e-commerce sites on Black Friday, according to Adobe. Spending for the four day event is forecast to be up 28.4%, or $9.6 billion, compared to a comparable period last year, Adobe reported. Amazon announced in June that this year's summer sale would extend from July 8 through 11, twice as long as last year's two-day event. This is the first time the July Prime Day sale has spanned four days. The e-commerce giant also added another first this year, daily deal drops available for limited times while supplies last. This strategy is designed to hold consumers' attentions throughout the four-day sale period, and keep them checking their phones frequently for new deals. Mobile Impulse Purchases Will Drive Growth Purchases made on phones and other mobile devices are again expected to hit record levels, at an estimated $12.5 billion, or 52.5% of online sales, according to Adobe's forecast. Mobile shopping is a growth driver because more impulse purchases are made on mobile devices, Adobe reported. Adobe expects Prime Day-related discounts to be comparable to last year's, and range between 10% to 24% off. The biggest average discounts are expected in apparel, at 24%, followed by electronics, 22% off; televisions, 17%; appliances, 16%; toys, 15%; furniture, 14%; computers, 12%; and sporting goods, 10%. Use Of AI Shopping Tools Expected To Surge Generative AI-powered chatbots and other AI shopping assistants are expected to play a big role in this year's Prime Day. Based on the surge in AI-driven sales during the 2024 holiday season, Adobe is anticipating that traffic from generative AI sources will be up 3,200% during the Prime Day event. “While AI-driven traffic remains modest compared to other channels such as paid search or email, the growth shows the value consumers are seeing in leveraging AI to quickly find information on deals and product details,” Adobe reported. Sales driven by affiliates and partners - which includes social media influencers - is expected to equal 19.9% of revenue, according to Adobe, up 16.6% over a year ago. Adobe's data shows consumers are 10 times more likely to make a purchase after seeing influencer content, compared to social media overall. Using Prime Day To 'Trade Up' Adobe tracks online spending throughout the year, and has studied Prime Day events in particular as an important indicator of consumer trends and spending confidence. It analyzes direct transactions online, covering over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites. Adobe expects, based on past behavior, that consumers are waiting for Prime Day discounts before buying big ticket items such as electronics and smartphones. Consumers also are expected to use Prime Day discounts to trade-up to higher-priced items, with the sales share of the most expensive goods expected to increase by 18% during the Prime Day event, compared to average levels.","Amazon's four-day Prime Day sales event is expected to drive a record $23.8 billion in U.S. e-commerce sales this week, according to a forecast released today by Adobe. The sales will take place not only on Amazon, but on other e-commerce sites, large and small, as competing retailers join in on what has become one of the biggest sales event of the year. “Two Black Fridays” Worth Of Spending Adobe expects the spending over the event, which was expanded from two days to four this year, to be equivalent to two Black Fridays, in terms of online spending. Last year, consumers spent $10.8 billion on U.S. e-commerce sites on Black Friday, according to Adobe. Spending for the four day event is forecast to be up 28.4%, or $9.6 billion, compared to a comparable period last year, Adobe reported.

mov_192C972C8D29D20C4FF5BFD144EB27A5,"  US stocks fell on Monday as President Trump made a fresh tariff threat and confirmed that country-specific duties will kick in on Aug. 1, ramping up trade uncertainty as the end to his tariff pause looms. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) slipped 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (ES=F) backed off 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.5% as Tesla (TSLA) stock sank amid worries about CEO Elon Musk's plan to launch a political party. Stocks are pulling back after a strong jobs report helped boost the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) to all-time closing highs on Thursday, before the early trading shutdown for the long Independence Day weekend. With equities at record levels, investors are wary that any sharp turn in trade negotiations could trigger volatility. Trump said late Sunday that any country aligning itself with the ""Anti-American policies of BRICS"" will face an additional 10% tariff. ""There will be no exceptions to this policy,"" he said in a post to social media. The warning came after BRICS — a group of countries including key US trading partners China and India — criticized Trump's tariff policy at its summit at the weekend. It ramped up already-high trade tensions as nations race to clinch tariff deals ahead of Trump's self-imposed deadline of July 9, when his ""pause"" on steep April tariffs would go back into effect. Global markets have been bracing for that potential shock, with the US only having reached deals with the UK and Vietnam, as well as a framework toward an agreement with China. On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump confirmed that while letters will be sent out this week informing countries of their tariff rates, those duties would not go into effect until Aug. 1. Bessent hinted at several possible deals in the coming days, suggesting the focus this week is clarity with 18 major trading partners before setting duties for the 100-plus other countries that the administration has in its sights for trade taxation. Earnings are coming back into the conversation this week, with Thursday's report from Delta (DAL) serving as the unofficial kickoff to the second quarter season.

El tema: ""De Patitas a la Feria"" La planificación de la feria comienza con un tema nuevo cada año, y en 2025 fue una celebración de las mascotas, el cual se vió reflejado en el entretenimiento, programación, señalización, oferta gastronómica y arte por toda la feria. El tema se manifestó principalmente a través de una exhibición temática personalizada de 1,858 metros cuadrados llamada ""Pets Rock: Live on Stage"", presentada por Kahoots, que llevó a los visitantes a un viaje desde el punto de vista de las mascotas. La exhibición también incluyó charlas educativas, una mini-tienda de mascotas Kahoots y animales adoptables de San Diego Humane Society. De los 42 animales adoptables que se presentaron en la exhibición, la mitad ya han encontrado familia. La Feria también contó con entretenimiento con temática de mascotas, como carreras de Corgis y Perros Salchicha; competencias de Dock Dogs y Flyball; exhibiciones de acrobacias caninas; sesiones de yoga para cachorros; y una velada con el famoso entrenador de perros César Millán. La Feria también permitió a los dueños de perros llevar a sus mascotas a una carrera y caminata recreativas antes de la apertura al público el sábado 5 de julio. Novedades en 2025 Pero la Feria es más que su tema anual: es una celebración única de la comunidad local. La Feria de este año ofreció algo para todos. Para garantizar la asistencia de todos, la Feria se centró en ofrecer promociones inigualadas por cualquier otro evento o recinto importante del Condado de San Diego. Además de las populares promociones como el Día para los Niños y las pulseras de Pepsi para los juegos mecánicos, la Feria 2025 presentó varias promociones y ofertas nuevas, entre ellas: ·         Viernes Gastronómicos (Foodie Fridays — 50% de descuento en 18 platillos finalistas del concurso de comida Fair-Tastic Foods de 11:00 a.m. a 4:00 p.m. los viernes en junio) ·         Viernes de Juegos (Game On Fridays — Todos los juegos de tiro por cuatro créditos de 11:00 a.m. a 4:00 p.m. los viernes en junio) ·         Venta de boletos con descuento en tiendas Albertsons | Vons ·         Venta de boletos en bases militares ·         Docenas de nuevos paquetes de comida por $15 ·         El regreso de los pases de temporada ·         Un descuento en el Fair Tripper para fomentar el uso del transporte público durante el feriado Juneteenth Compras y Exhibiciones Además, la Feria presentó una nueva experiencia de compras con el San Diego Marketplace, que presentó productos artesanales en un entorno de tienda de consignación cuidadosamente seleccionado, un salón de tatuajes y un popular estudio de retratos estilo centro comercial. La Feria también presentó una nueva exhibición: Farm 2U, ubicada en el O'Brien Hall, para promover la agricultura y brindar educación sobre alimentos y flores, desde la granja hasta la mesa. La exhibición destacó a varios agricultores locales y sus productos, además de ofrecer prácticas sesiones de cocina para aprender nuevas habilidades culinarias y otros conocimientos. Entretenimiento La Feria ofreció una gran variedad de géneros musicales. Por primera vez desde 2019, se presentaron espectáculos en el escenario Corona Grandstand todas las noches. La primera incursión de la Feria en un espectáculo de música electrónica, con Zedd, fue una de los dos conciertos con entradas agotadas durante la Serie de Conciertos de Verano de Toyota. El otro artista con entradas agotadas fue el de la estrella country Jon Pardi, quien atrajo a más de 8,300 asistentes. La Feria también contó con una variedad de espectáculos inmersivos y presentaciones de comedia como parte de su serie Summer Nights at The Sound, así como entretenimiento y festivales multiculturales, incluido el Festival inaugural de K-Pop, el evento anual con temática LGBt Out at the Fair, un Día de la Herencia Nativa Americana y los tradicionales domingos ""Domingueando en la Feria"", que culminan con grupos en español en el escenario Grandstand. Impacto Económico La Feria nuevamente brindó oportunidades económicas a trabajadores, pequeñas empresas, emprendedores, artistas, contratistas, vendedores, artesanos y otros. En particular, la tercera edición del Concurso de Alimentos Fair-tastic brindó un impulso promocional a los puestos de comida participantes. El tradicional puesto de comida Country Fair Cinnamon Rolls vendió más de 7,000 de sus nuevos Roles de Canela Tres Leches, casi 400 al día. El restaurante Farmer in the Del también experimentó un aumento de popularidad gracias a sus papas fritas Super Volcano, ganadoras del premio ""People's Choice"".

Over the last couple of weeks, the usual soap schedule has been thrown into chaos. And now fans have well and truly had enough of the long-wait. They've demanded that the channel comes up with a solution. Coronation Street schedule thrown into chaos Coronation Street usually airs on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays for one-hour each episode, between 8pm-9pm. However, the past couple of weeks have seen this usual routine be thrown up in the air. This is due to a summer of sport taking over ITV. The most recent episode of Coronation Street aired on Wednesday, July 2. And, the next won't air until Thursday, July 10 between 9pm-10pm. This gives an eight day break between Corrie episodes, with fans unhappy over missing their usual soap episode fix. Currently, the UEFA Women's Euros coverage is airing on the ITV main channel temporarily upheaving the schedule. Coronation Street fans beg for ITVX uploads for 'missing' episodes With episodes of Corrie usually being uploaded to ITVX and YouTube on the day they're due to air on the ITV main channel, fans are now begging for ITV to continue to upload episodes of Corrie onto these platforms as a replacement of the main channel episodes when sports are on. This way soap fans could still watch episodes on the day they're used to without feeling as though they're missing out. One fan on Reddit wrote: “I don't get it if they're releasing on the app before airing on ITV, why can't they on the days it's not shown live still put it onto ITVX? Hollyoaks used to do it if it wasn't going to be on a certain day it would still be available to watch on the app.” Another said: “I enjoy the women's football but surely they could put Corrie on later or just have the episodes available on demand?” A third person added: “There is no reason why the soaps need to stop. If ITV must show the Women's Football, then put the soaps on ITV2 at the normal time, and then air them later than normal on ITV.” Coronation Street usually airs Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8pm on ITV.

FOR THE RECORDER/LUKE MACANNUCO “Jaylin in RED” by artist and activist Nayana LaFond. FOR THE RECORDER/LUKE MACANNUCO A wall of Nayana LaFond's portraits at The LAVA Center in Greenfield. FOR THE RECORDER/LUKE MACANNUCO A wall of Nayana LaFond's portraits at The LAVA Center in Greenfield. FOR THE RECORDER/LUKE MACANNUCO The painted gaze of Littlefox, a Native American woman from Minneapolis, follows viewers who enter The LAVA Center to view the arts venue's current exhibit, “Portraits in RED: Missing and Murdered Indigenous People” by artist and activist Nayana LaFond. Littlefox's portrait is just one of 19 in the exhibit, which opened at 324 Main St. in Greenfield on May 2 and will continue through the end of July. The 19 portraits are a fraction of LaFond's series, which looks to highlight the widespread yet overlooked violence that Native Americans face, particularly women and girls. A 2016 National Institute of Justice study found that 84.3% of Native American women experience violence in their lifetime. LaFond's portraits are mostly black and white, with red being the only other color included, often in the form of a handprint. “The red hand represents being silenced,” LaFond said. “It represents the blood of our people, but it also represents resilience and fighting back.” LaFond, who grew up in western Massachusetts and is a citizen of the Mètis Nation of Ontario, got the idea for the portraits during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was May 5, 2020 — which is the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls — when LaFond was scrolling through a Facebook group called “Social Distance Powwow,” which is in part dedicated to the sharing of Native American culture through art. LaFond decided to paint a portrait of a member of the group whose selfie she saw. “I painted it, shared it with the group and got a lot of reactions, over 2,000 overnight,” LaFond recounted. After the first painting, LaFond decided to do another, which garnered twice as many reactions. Being isolated at home with plenty of canvases and acrylic paints, LaFond decided to keep the portraits going, advertising on the Facebook page that she would paint anyone who has been affected by the epidemic of violence against Indigenous people. “I got 25 [requests] in the first day,” LaFond said. “So at that moment, I went, 'Oh, I guess I should paint all of these, because I don't feel right about picking and choosing.' Because these are people with stories and lives.” Some of the portraits depict victims of violence or family members of victims. LaFond has been winding down the series over the last year and a half, and is in the process of returning the portraits to their subject or subject's family after her current run of shows is done. “If the family wants it, it's theirs, and I'll find a way to get it to them,” LaFond said. “And if they don't, if they're uncomfortable with having it in their home, they can sell it and keep the money or donate the money. It's up to them.” Matthew Barlow, The LAVA Center's humanities coordinator, is responsible for the curation of LaFond's work at the center. Barlow's position, which is funded by Mass Humanities, is coming to a close this summer, making LaFond's exhibit one of Barlow's final projects for the venue. When Barlow first saw LaFond's work, he said, he was overwhelmed. “These portraits kind of blew me away,” Barlow said. “I just felt physically affected.” Barlow's hope is that the exhibit raises awareness of the plight of Native American people. “I've watched people walk in and they can't look away,” Barlow said. “They come timidly, or they march right up, or they carefully go through every story. But people are really noticing it. I've had a lot of conversations with people about it.” For LaFond, the hope is that viewers are “reading [the subject's] story, looking at them as if they're looking at a person, not a painting, because that's the point.” The LAVA Center is open Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 8 p.m., Fridays from 5 to 8 p.m. and Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. More Arts for you 14 Hope St Suite 101 Greenfield, MA 01301 413-772-0261 Circulation Customer Service • 413-774-2741 • circinfo@recorder.com Social Media...","Greenfield Recorder - Centered is “Littlefox in RED,” by artist and activist Nayana LaFond.

mov_5494CCBB7BFD89FFE06921EE206EE99A,"  Amazon Prime Day is back—and it's bigger than ever. For the first time since its inception a decade ago, the members-only Prime event is scheduled to run for four days across 20 countries, instead of the typical two days. The extended Prime Day runs from midnight on July 8 through the 11th, and could generate more than $21 billion in gross merchandise value, growing 60% from last year, estimated Justin Post, an analyst at BofA Securities. “Amazon's 2025 summer Prime Day is poised to be its largest ever, with the potential to deliver record-breaking sales, reinforce its competitive moat, and boost both retail and advertising revenues,” wrote Ivan Feinseth, chief market strategist of Tigress Financial Intelligence. Last year's Prime Day broke records too, Amazon said at the time, notching a new high for both sales and number of items sold. But it isn't just Amazon. Although the e-commerce giant pioneered the midsummer shopping event back in 2015, mid-July sales have become as much of a staple as Black Friday across the sector. This year, Target's Circle Week runs from July 6 through the 12th and Walmart's deals from July 8 through the 13th. The deals will provide a big boost to the digital economy. From July 8 to July 11, U.S. retailers are expected to drive a record $23.8 billion in online spend, up 28.4% year over year, according to estimates from Adobe analytics released Monday. This is equivalent to two Black Fridays, which drove $10.8 billion in online spend in 2024, Adobe said. The firm expects discounts will remain at “historically high levels” across all retailers, ranging from 10% to 24% off an item's listed price. Those discounts should prompt shoppers to buy pricier items that they may have been holding off on until now, Adobe forecasts. Apparel, electronics, televisions, and appliances will see the best deals this week, Adobe projects. Indeed, Amazon already gave shoppers a sneak peek of what they can expect, including up to 50% off on Levi-Strauss apparel and Zappos shoes; up to 40% off on televisions, vacuums, Anker speakers, Samsung Chromebooks and tablets, and premium cosmetics; and up to 30% off on toys, fragrances, and Away suitcases. The company is also introducing “Today's Big Deals,” which are themed daily price drops exclusive to members. The special offers will launch daily at midnight Pacific time and will be available until supplies last, Amazon said. Target and Walmart aren't falling behind. Target is focusing on back-to-school prep, offering Target Circle members 30% off on select apparel, uniforms, backpacks and school supplies, as well as deals on groceries and personal care items. Walmart is also boasting sales on back to school, as well as discounts on electronics, such as knocking off $100 from a Samsung computer monitor. The deals will be available for all Walmart customers, but Walmart+ members get access a day early. And for the first time, Walmart is offering its deals both in stores and online, the company said. Yet even though Amazon's competitors are putting up a good fight, the company will still come out ahead. Prime Day isn't simply a big driver of sales—it also increases Prime membership sign-ups, wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies. In 2024, a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to Prime Day, with millions of new members worldwide. The Amazon Prime membership is a major loyalty driver for the retailer, Thill said. A recent Jefferies consumer survey found that 73% of respondents report having a Prime membership—far above 26% for Walmart+ and 22% for Target Circle. Most of those respondents said they intended to keep their memberships, which could present important upside for Amazon, given that research suggests that members of loyalty programs often make more frequent or larger purchases than non-loyalty members. Amazon may also get an extra boost from recently rolled out AI initiatives. This Prime Day, customers can ask Amazon's AI shopping assistant, Rufus, specific questions about timing and tailored deal recommendations; use AI-powered shopping guides to refine searches; and ask Alexa+, Amazon's AI personal assistant, to track prices and notify them when they drop. And that isn't counting any web-traffic benefits Amazon could get from third-party AI chat services and browsers. Adobe expects traffic from generative AI sources to increase by 3,200% year over year across all retailers. Web traffic from AI chatbots is still dwarfed by more traditional search methods, including going to web browsers or through email marketing, Adobe acknowledged, but it's becoming more ingrained in the consumer shopping pattern. In a recent survey of 5,000 U.S. consumers, 55% said they used generative AI for conducting shopping research, 47% said they used it for product recommendations, and 43% said it helped them seek out deals. Historically, Amazon shares have gotten a slight lift following Prime Day, gaining an average of 1.11% the week after the event ends and 3.29% the month after, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The stock could use the boost, no matter how small. Shares are up 1.8% this year as of Thursday's close, underperforming the S&P 500's 6.8% gain and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite's 6.7% increase. Saddle up, deal-hunters—we're in for a long week. Maybe investors should be preparing, too, in case the chance pops up to snap up Amazon stock. It isn't every day you get a potential bargain on a retail giant. Write to Sabrina Escobar at sabrina.escobar@barrons.com","Amazon Prime Day is back—and it's bigger than ever. For the first time since its inception a decade ago, the members-only Prime event is scheduled to run for four days across 20 countries, instead of the typical two days. The extended Prime Day runs from midnight on July 8 through the 11th, and could generate more than $21 billion in gross merchandise value, growing 60% from last year, estimated Justin Post, an analyst at BofA Securities. “Amazon's 2025 summer Prime Day is poised to be its largest ever, with the potential to deliver record-breaking sales, reinforce its competitive moat, and boost both retail and advertising revenues,” wrote Ivan Feinseth, chief market strategist of Tigress Financial Intelligence. Last year's Prime Day broke records too, Amazon said at the time, notching a new high for both sales and number of items sold. But it isn't just Amazon. Although the e-commerce giant pioneered the midsummer shopping event back in 2015, mid-July sales have become as much of a staple as Black Friday across the sector. This year, Target's Circle Week runs from July 6 through the 12th and Walmart's deals from July 8 through the 13th. The deals will provide a big boost to the digital economy. From July 8 to July 11, U.S. retailers are expected to drive a record $23.8 billion in online spend, up 28.4% year over year, according to estimates from Adobe analytics released Monday. This is equivalent to two Black Fridays, which drove $10.8 billion in online spend in 2024, Adobe said. The firm expects discounts will remain at “historically high levels” across all retailers, ranging from 10% to 24% off an item's listed price. Those discounts should prompt shoppers to buy pricier items that they may have been holding off on until now, Adobe forecasts. Apparel, electronics, televisions, and appliances will see the best deals this week, Adobe projects. Indeed, Amazon already gave shoppers a sneak peek of what they can expect, including up to 50% off on Levi-Strauss apparel and Zappos shoes; up to 40% off on televisions, vacuums, Anker speakers, Samsung Chromebooks and tablets, and premium cosmetics; and up to 30% off on toys, fragrances, and Away suitcases. The company is also introducing “Today's Big Deals,” which are themed daily price drops exclusive to members. The special offers will launch daily at midnight Pacific time and will be available until supplies last, Amazon said. Target and Walmart aren't falling behind. Target is focusing on back-to-school prep, offering Target Circle members 30% off on select apparel, uniforms, backpacks and school supplies, as well as deals on groceries and personal care items. Walmart is also boasting sales on back to school, as well as discounts on electronics, such as knocking off $100 from a Samsung computer monitor. The deals will be available for all Walmart customers, but Walmart+ members get access a day early. And for the first time, Walmart is offering its deals both in stores and online, the company said. Yet even though Amazon's competitors are putting up a good fight, the company will still come out ahead. Prime Day isn't simply a big driver of sales—it also increases Prime membership sign-ups, wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies. In 2024, a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to Prime Day, with millions of new members worldwide. The Amazon Prime membership is a major loyalty driver for the retailer, Thill said. A recent Jefferies consumer survey found that 73% of respondents report having a Prime membership—far above 26% for Walmart+ and 22% for Target Circle. Most of those respondents said they intended to keep their memberships, which could present important upside for Amazon, given that research suggests that members of loyalty programs often make more frequent or larger purchases than non-loyalty members. Amazon may also get an extra boost from recently rolled out AI initiatives. This Prime Day, customers can ask Amazon's AI shopping assistant, Rufus, specific questions about timing and tailored deal recommendations; use AI-powered shopping guides to refine searches; and ask Alexa+, Amazon's AI personal assistant, to track prices and notify them when they drop. And that isn't counting any web-traffic benefits Amazon could get from third-party AI chat services and browsers.

mov_08885FF4F54AF891B8AD31CF4564362C,"  San Diego County Fair in Del Mar (Photo by Chris Stone/Times of San Diego) The 2025 San Diego County Fair closed Sunday night after a smooth and festive 20-day run that drew more than 874,000 visitors and featured an array of new attractions, value deals, and pet-themed programming. Held under the theme “Summer Pet-tacular,” this year's fair embraced the joy of pet ownership with themed exhibits, entertainment, and educational activities—all while continuing its mission to provide a safe, inclusive, and affordable experience for all San Diegans. “Fair season is the most joyous time of the year — a time when we get to celebrate our community, with our community,” said Carlene Moore, CEO of the 22nd District Agricultural Association, which produces the annual event. “This year, we fostered a remarkable guest experience, tried out new ideas and layouts, and offered top-tier entertainment. The result? Smiling faces, sweet and savory treats, and a festive atmosphere enjoyed by guests of all ages.” Pet-Centered Fun and a New Exhibit The 2025 theme came to life through a 20,000-square-foot exhibit, “Pets Rock: Live on Tour,” presented by Kahoots. The immersive experience showcased life through the eyes of pets, featured adoptable animals from the San Diego Humane Society, and included interactive elements like a mini pet store and daily talks. Of the 42 animals showcased, half have already been adopted. Other pet-centric events included Corgi and Wiener dog races, DockDogs and Flyball competitions, stunt dog shows, puppy yoga, and a special appearance by dog trainer Cesar Millan. Dog owners even had a chance to walk or run with their pooches before the Fair opened on July 5. New Attractions and Expanded Deals Beyond the theme, the fair introduced new experiences and a broader range of value-driven promotions to ensure accessibility for all visitors. Highlights included: Foodie Fridays – 50% off select food items from 11 a.m.–4 p.m. Game On Fridays – All games are available for four credits on Friday afternoons New $15 meal deals and discounted tickets at Albertsons   Vons, for military families, and through community programs Fair Tripper transit discounts for Juneteenth The return of season passes The San Diego Marketplace, a new curated shopping space, debuted this year with artisan vendors, a tattoo parlor, and a portrait studio. Another major addition was Farm 2U, an agriculture-focused exhibit in O'Brien Hall showcasing local farmers, culinary demos, and the farm-to-table process. Entertainment Highlights For the first time since 2019, the Toyota Summer Concert Series filled the Corona Grandstand Stage every night of the Fair. Two shows sold out: country star Jon Pardi (8,333 attendees) and EDM artist Zedd (8,323 attendees). Evening programming also included the Summer Nights at The Sound series, comedy shows, and cultural festivals, such as the inaugural K-POP Festival, Native American Heritage Day, Out at the Fair, and Spanish-language Sundays under the popular “Domingueando en la Feria” banner. Economic and Community Impact The fair once again provided significant economic opportunities for small businesses, artisans, performers, vendors, and contractors. More than 1,200 temporary employees were hired by the 22nd DAA, in addition to thousands hired by concessionaires and partners. The third-annual Fair-Tastic Foods Competition helped elevate vendors like Country Fair Cinnamon Rolls, which sold over 7,200 of its new Tres Leches rolls, and Farmer in Del, whose “Super Volcano Fries” took home the People's Choice Award. This year's attendance—874,263 over 20 days—nearly matched 2024 figures, averaging almost 44,000 guests per day. Dignitaries in attendance included San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria, U.S. Rep. Mike Levin, Chula Vista Mayor John McCann, and other local officials. For the first time, the Fair also brought the festivities to Rady Children's Hospital, offering a mini-fair experience to patients and their families. “That's what the fair does best — bringing joy to the lives of all San Diegans,” Moore said. “We already can't wait to do it all over again next year.” By the Numbers: 2025 San Diego County Fair Highlights 874,263 attendees $293 million regional economic impact (inflation-adjusted from 2019 study) 0 major safety incidents 70 rides, including 10 new additions 1,268 temporary employees hired by the 22nd DAA 7,200 Tres Leches Cinnamon Rolls sold (2,600 pounds total) 30,321 turkey legs sold 18,222 performers 17,481 competitive exhibit entries 4,212 blue ribbons awarded 75,730 attendees at the Toyota Summer Concert Series 547 tattoos inked in the Marketplace 105 buyers participated in the Junior Livestock Auction, which raised $664,128 12,000+ water bottles saved by new refill stations 682 items turned into Lost & Found 917 entries in the Pet-tacular Photo Challenge 15,016 free tickets distributed through the Fair-for-All Program 58,520 – single busiest day attendance 87 piercings performed 628 local fairgoers featured on community banners Finally We wish PressBee provided you with enough information of ( ) Also on site","San Diego County Fair in Del Mar (Photo by Chris Stone/Times of San Diego) The 2025 San Diego County Fair closed Sunday night after a smooth and festive 20-day run that drew more than 874,000 visitors and featured an array of new attractions, value deals, and pet-themed programming.

Evening programming also included the Summer Nights at The Sound series, comedy shows, and cultural festivals, such as the inaugural K-POP Festival, Native American Heritage Day, Out at the Fair, and Spanish-language Sundays under the popular “Domingueando en la Feria” banner. Economic and Community Impact The fair once again provided significant economic opportunities for small businesses, artisans, performers, vendors, and contractors. More than 1,200 temporary employees were hired by the 22nd DAA, in addition to thousands hired by concessionaires and partners. The third-annual Fair-Tastic Foods Competition helped elevate vendors like Country Fair Cinnamon Rolls, which sold over 7,200 of its new Tres Leches rolls, and Farmer in Del, whose “Super Volcano Fries” took home the People's Choice Award. This year's attendance—874,263 over 20 days—nearly matched 2024 figures, averaging almost 44,000 guests per day. Dignitaries in attendance included San Diego Mayor Todd Gloria, U.S. Rep. Mike Levin, Chula Vista Mayor John McCann, and other local officials. For the first time, the Fair also brought the festivities to Rady Children's Hospital, offering a mini-fair experience to patients and their families. “That's what the fair does best — bringing joy to the lives of all San Diegans,” Moore said. “We already can't wait to do it all over again next year.” By the Numbers: 2025 San Diego County Fair Highlights 874,263 attendees $293 million regional economic impact (inflation-adjusted from 2019 study) 0 major safety incidents 70 rides, including 10 new additions 1,268 temporary employees hired by the 22nd DAA 7,200 Tres Leches Cinnamon Rolls sold (2,600 pounds total) 30,321 turkey legs sold 18,222 performers 17,481 competitive exhibit entries 4,212 blue ribbons awarded 75,730 attendees at the Toyota Summer Concert Series 547 tattoos inked in the Marketplace 105 buyers participated in the Junior Livestock Auction, which raised $664,128 12,000+ water bottles saved by new refill stations...","The 2025 San Diego County Fair closed Sunday night after a smooth and festive 20-day run that drew more than 874,000 visitors and featured an array of new attractions, value deals, and pet-themed programming. Held under the theme “Summer Pet-tacular,” this year's fair embraced the joy of pet ownership with themed exhibits, entertainment, and educational activities—all while continuing its mission to provide a safe, inclusive, and affordable experience for all San Diegans. “Fair season is the most joyous time of the year — a time when we get to celebrate our community, with our community,” said Carlene Moore, CEO of the 22nd District Agricultural Association, which produces the annual event. “This year, we fostered a remarkable guest experience, tried out new ideas and layouts, and offered top-tier entertainment. The result? Smiling faces, sweet and savory treats, and a festive atmosphere enjoyed by guests of all ages.” Pet-Centered Fun and a New Exhibit The 2025 theme came to life through a 20,000-square-foot exhibit, “Pets Rock: Live on Tour,” presented by Kahoots. The immersive experience showcased life through the eyes of pets, featured adoptable animals from the San Diego Humane Society, and included interactive elements like a mini pet store and daily talks. Of the 42 animals showcased, half have already been adopted. Other pet-centric events included Corgi and Wiener dog races, DockDogs and Flyball competitions, stunt dog shows, puppy yoga, and a special appearance by dog trainer Cesar Millan. Dog owners even had a chance to walk or run with their pooches before the Fair opened on July 5. New Attractions and Expanded Deals Beyond the theme, the fair introduced new experiences and a broader range of value-driven promotions to ensure accessibility for all visitors. Highlights included: Foodie Fridays – 50% off select food items from 11 a.m.–4 p.m. Game On Fridays – All games are available for four credits on Friday afternoons New $15 meal deals and discounted tickets at Albertsons | Vons, for military families, and through community programs Fair Tripper transit discounts for Juneteenth The return of season passes The San Diego Marketplace, a new curated shopping space, debuted this year with artisan vendors, a tattoo parlor, and a portrait studio. Another major addition was Farm 2U, an agriculture-focused exhibit in O'Brien Hall showcasing local farmers, culinary demos, and the farm-to-table process.

Exclusive research by The Independent reveals Fridays, Sundays and Mondays will be the most crowded days in the terminals. The peak days for the great getaway for all the top UK hubs can be revealed using sources including the airports themselves and flight data supplied exclusively by aviation data analyst Cirium. For the leading Scottish airports, the second week of July will bring the biggest crowds. Several English airports will see a surge in passenger numbers in the final 10 days of July when the schools have broken up. But the quartet of UK airports in the 30-million plus category – , , and – will see their busiest days in the second half of August. Along with peak passenger numbers, runways will be worked hard. At Gatwick, the world's busiest single-runway airport, a plane will land or take off an average of every 95 seconds around the clock on a couple of days in August – with just 65 seconds between departures and arrivals in peak hours. Choosing to fly on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday is likely to lead to a calmer experience. Five of the top airports are busiest on Fridays, and three each are predicted to have their peak days on Sundays and Mondays: Friday: Bristol, , Glasgow, , . Sunday: , Luton, . Monday: Glasgow, Liverpool, Newcastle. The main airports in Northern Ireland and Wales – Belfast International and Cardiff respectively – have already passed their peak days for summer 205. But the Welsh airport will see its busiest day for departures on 28 August, with 2,684 passengers expected to take off. On Monday 1 September, the signal that the country is back to back to work is that London City's busiest day is expected at the start of the ninth month. On that day 89 flights with 9,195 seats will depart from the Docklands airport. Crowd calendar: the peak dates Friday 11 July: Edinburgh Scotland's busiest airport is expected to handle 61,636 passengers, evenly distributed between arrivals and departures. Travellers heading off on holiday will benefit from the airport from the start of this week – raising the limit from 100ml to two litres. Monday 14 July: Glasgow Around 15,000 passengers will depart from the Clydeside airport on a predicted 113 flights to 52 destinations. The most popular international routes from Glasgow are to Dubai, Malaga, Palma, Paris, Tenerife, Faro, Dalaman, Corfu and Toronto. Monday 21 July: Newcastle On Tyneside, the first Monday after the schools break up will be busiest, with 75 departing flights and up to 24,000 passengers flying through Newcastle. Friday 25 July: Birmingham The West Midlands hub is thriving, with 161 flights carrying more than 26,000 people departing on the final Friday of the month. In contrast with the long queues experienced by some passengers in 2024, Birmingham was the first airport this summer to relax security restrictions on liquids. Sunday 27 July: Luton London's fourth-biggest airport (after Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) is expecting to handle more than 31,000 passengers both arriving and departing. The busiest day for departures alone will be the following Friday 1 August, while on the last day of August almost 32,000 passengers are expected to arrive. Peak departures from the busiest airport in the West are on Friday 25/Saturday 26 July. But these two August Fridays will be the busiest days of the summer with around 40,000 people coming and going. Sunday 17 August: Gatwick August is peak month at the Sussex holiday hub. “There are five days over the summer period where we have 900 or more flights, all in August,” a Gatwick spokesperson tells me.

Friday 22 August: Manchester Around 115,000 passengers, evenly split between inbound and outbound, are expected to fly out of the nation's third-busiest airport (after Heathrow and Gatwick). The top destinations are mostly Mediterranean sunspots – Palma, Alicante, Antalya and Dalaman – plus Dubai, thanks to the three daily Airbus A380 arrivals and departures on Emirates. Monday 25 August: Liverpool According to Cirium, departing flights and seats will be at a maximum on Monday 28 July, with 66 flights and more than 12,000 seats.

But at least one company is forecasting that sales for the online sales event will break records as budget-conscious shoppers look for deals. Amazon is holding its annual Prime Day sales from July 8 through July 11 – twice as long as last year's event. The event, open to Prime members, has also offered early-access deals. Still, some Amazon third-party sellers are sitting out this Prime Day, amid pressures from tariffs. A record $23.8 billion in sales is expected to be spent by consumers for Amazon Prime Days, Adobe said in a forecast released on July 7. That's a 28.4% increase year over year and $9.6 billion more than the comparable period last year. Last year, shoppers spent $14.2 billion during the two-day Amazon Prime event, according to Adobe. Adobe said discounts for Prime Days is expected to remain at historically high levels – on par with the major deals that consumers saw last year during the shorter sale. Overall, discounts across U.S. retailers will range from 10% to 24% off list prices with apparel expected to have the biggest deals at 24%, Adobe said. Other categories with major discounts include electronics (22%), televisions (17%), appliances (16%), toys (15%) furniture (14%), computers, (12%) and sporting goods (10%). Consumers are also expected to ""trade up"" to higher-ticket items, driven by strong discounts Adobe said. U.S. shoppers, in two separate surveys ahead of Prime Days, said looming tariffs were playing a role in how they are shopping. In a 2025 summer spending survey of 1,024 U.S. shoppers by Smarty, an online shopping rewards app, shoppers were pretty evenly split in how tariffs were affecting their shopping habits for the Amazon sales. Thirty-two percent of shoppers said they were being more selective about purchases due to budget constraints, while 25% were planning to buy more items to avoid anticipated future price increases. Another 23% said they would focus specifically on categories likely to be affected by tariffs. ""This year's July Prime Day represents a perfect storm of seasonal shopping and economic anxiety,"" Vipin Porwal, founder and CEO at Smarty, said in a press release. ""Consumers are leveraging the discounts not just for immediate needs, but as a hedge against potential future price increases in tariff-affected categories. Prime Day will be an early indicator for consumer savviness in using major sales events as opportunities to make strategic purchases ahead of anticipated price changes."" In another study of 1,000 consumers by Ankeneo, more than half or 57% of those surveyed said tariffs are impacting their Prime Day shopping habits with 25% saying they planned to skip or buy less because of possible price hikes. Four percent of shoppers surveyed said they planned to shop with other retailers, according to the survey by Ankeneo, a software company that works with retailers on its products. Some third-party merchants who previously sold China-made goods during Amazon's July event told Reuters earlier this year that they would be sitting out this year or reducing the amount of discounted merchandise they offer. The pullback, Reuters reported, was a way for sellers to protect profit margins amid the U.S China trade war. In April, Kim Vaccarella, chief executive of China-made tote bag company Bogg Bag, told Reuters that she had decided to skip Prime Day this year. Vaccarella said she wanted to retain some of her unsold U.S. inventory and hoped to sell to retailers and smaller, independent shops, at full price or for smaller discounts. She had also halted production of the bags, which sell for $70 to $200 on Amazon, while she worked to move manufacturing to Cambodia and Vietnam. Smaller third-party Amazon sellers are more impacted by tariff costs than larger retailers, said Katherine Black, a partner at global management consulting firm Kearney where she leads food, drug and mass market retail. ""There have been a number of small suppliers that have said 'Look, I did some forward buys, but I'm holding that inventory to try to sell it close to full price to manage my exposure and I'm not going to participate this year,' "" Black told USA TODAY. When is Amazon Prime Day 2025? Dates, deals and what to know about summer sales event There will still be plenty of deals for shoppers to choose from during Prime Days, Black said. She anticipates potentially seeing what she called big, showcase deals each day from big-named brands. ""Those are techniques we'll see when retailers are trying to drive traffic,"" she said. Lauren Beitelspacher, a professor in the marketing division of Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, whose area of study includes retail thinks the Prime Day event will be successful, especially since consumers are more price-conscious right now with tariffs and there is tariff confusion. ""I think customers are just really looking for a deal wherever they can get one,"" she told USA TODAY. Ten percent tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. began in April, with additional ""reciprocal"" tariffs on imports from more than 70 countries. President Donald Trump later delayed the reciprocal tariffs until July 9. The White House announced on July 7 that the deadline would be extended to August 1.

But these are exactly the creatures that appeared to an unnamed woman recluse living in Winchester, England, over the course of three nights in the summer of 1422. The woman was an anchoress. That means she had chosen - and subsequently vowed - to live in solitary confinement within a small cell attached to a church for the rest of her life.The recluse wrote a vivid account of her vision and sent it to her confessor and a circle of influential churchmen. Her letter, known today as A Revelation of Purgatory , makes her one of the earliest known women writers in the English language. Despite deserving this accolade, the Winchester recluse did not appear alongside her more famous contemporaries or near contemporaries, Julian of Norwich (1342 - after 1416) and Margery Kempe (circa 1373 - after 1438), in the British Library's hugely successful recent exhibition, Medieval Women: In Their Own Words .

Transformed into vicious satanic minions, Margaret's former pets joined the many devils responsible for doling out her punishments. They tore endlessly at her flesh and bit and scratched her relentlessly. They did so to remind her that, as a nun, she had broken her vows by keeping them as her companions in her nunnery and by devoting too much love and attention to them.

She not only detailed all she had seen, but also stipulated which prayers, and how many, should be said on behalf of poor Margaret to deliver her from her suffering and help her reach the gates of heaven.

mov_1ECE0932E8FF5EB0E1E3087323A18FD3,"  ( JTA ) — TRONDHEIM, Norway — If ever there was a synagogue that's earned the right to throw itself a birthday shindig, it's this elegant and intriguing house of worship in central Norway only 220 miles south of the Arctic Circle. Over the past century, the Trondheim Synagogue has weathered isolation from the rest of the Jewish world; the Holocaust, which wiped out half its community; challenges related to Shabbat observance because of its far northern latitude, and persistent antisemitism that has only grown worse since the war in Gaza began in 2023. This fall, the synagogue will be observing its 100-year anniversary with a three-day celebration, culminating with an Oct. 26 event which members of Norway's royal family, the country's prime minister, the mayor of Trondheim and other dignitaries are scheduled to attend. “There will be speeches, songs and, of course, we will tell the history of the community,” says John Arne Moen, president of the Trondheim Jewish Community. “We are on the outskirts of the Jewish world, living close to the polar circle. You will probably not find a community like ours any other place in the world.” With a population of about 200,000, Trondheim is Norway's third-largest city, behind Oslo and Bergen. Located on the shores of a fjord that's an inlet in the Norwegian Sea, the city was founded in the year 997 and was Norway's capital during the Viking Age. The city's most famous site is the Nidaros Cathedral, completed in 1300 at the burial place of King Olav II, who is credited with bringing Christianity to Norway. The unlikely story of Jewish life in Trondheim began in the late 19th century, when Jewish immigrants began arriving from Poland and Lithuania, usually because they couldn't afford to go to America. Many worked as traveling merchants. By 1900, there were more than 100 Jews living in Trondheim and the city's first synagogue was established. During the next 20 years, the community grew to more than 300 members, prompting the need for a larger synagogue. In 1923 an old railway station at Arkitekt Christies Gate 1 was purchased with the financial support of approximately 200 Jews from Oslo and converted into a synagogue. It was inaugurated in 1925 and remains — along with the synagogue in Oslo — one of only two synagogues in the country. The building, designed in the Neoclassical style, is fronted by a light-blue façade with arched windows and white molding. Inside, the two-story sanctuary also features a blue motif. Originally, women were seated in the balcony during services. Now, the balcony is no longer used; men and women sit together on the main floor. Germany occupied Norway from 1940 to 1945. The Nazis confiscated the synagogue and used it as a barracks, replacing the Stars of David in the windows with swastikas. It's believed that 165 local Jews — about half of Trondheim's Jewish population at the time — died in the Holocaust, fueled by robust collaboration by local authorities. Most of the victims were deported by train to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, where only a few survived. Early efforts to memorialize the murdered Jews of Trondheim were undertaken by the remnants of the community that survived . But in the mid-1990s, the city embarked on its own memorial enterprise, choosing Cissi Klein — who was 13 when she was seized from her school, deported to Auschwitz and killed upon arrival — to become a symbol of Trondheim's Nazi victims. A statue of Cissi stands in a quiet park a short walk from the Trondheim Synagogue. Built in 1997 as part of the city's millennium commemorations, the memorial is located outside the apartment building where Cissi lived with her parents and brother. A street alongside the park has been named in her honor. Today, Moen estimates there are 200 Jews living in Trondheim; about three-quarters are members of the synagogue. Shabbat services are typically held every other Friday. The chief rabbi of Norway, Michael Melchior, lives in Israel but periodically travels to Oslo and Trondheim to conduct services. ( Melchior's father was the longtime chief rabbi of Denmark .) When Melchior isn't in town, services are usually led by Israeli-born Asher Serussi, a religious leader in the community who has lived in Trondheim for 30 years. Serussi describes the Trondheim Synagogue as “Orthodox but very flexible and modern.” “Most of the people here are not observant Jews,” he said. “Our members are interested in the Jewish culture and traditions. But they don't keep kosher and they don't keep Shabbat. They enjoy very much when we have celebrations for holidays. Then it's a full house here.” For the more religious who follow halacha, or traditional Jewish law, the question about how to handle the starting and ending times of Shabbat has been a topic of debate ever since the congregation was founded in 1905. According to halacha, Shabbat begins a few minutes before sunset and lasts for 25 hours. But Trondheim is located so far north that the amount of daylight can vary between 20 hours in the summer and just four hours in the winter. So what's an Orthodox congregation to do in a country known as “the land of the midnight sun”? Other communities in far northern latitudes handle the issue in a variety of ways . Some set the Shabbat clock based on Jerusalem time, while others divide the day equally into two 12-hour segments. Some start Shabbat at the traditional moment, even if that means lighting candles around midnight. Moen says the congregation developed its own approach in its early years of existence that seemed to be palatable to its members and blessed by most of the Orthodox rabbis who have examined the question. For the Trondheim Synagogue, Shabbat begins at 5:30 p.m. on Fridays and ends at 6:30 p.m. on Saturdays, regardless of the time of year and whether or not there's sunlight or polar darkness. “It's been our rule for 120 years,” says Moen. “We have grown up with it....","( JTA ) — TRONDHEIM, Norway — If ever there was a synagogue that's earned the right to throw itself a birthday shindig, it's this elegant and intriguing house of worship in central Norway only 220 miles south of the Arctic Circle.

Bush and first lady Laura Bush, appeared during the early hours of the Today show to discuss her family's ties to Camp Mystic, the Christian summer camp, which suffered the loss of 27 young female campers and still has at least 10 others missing. ""My mom was a counselor there, but also so many of my friends were raised at this camp,” Bush Hager told co-host Craig Melvin while becoming audibly emotional. “Texas camps are institutions, as you just heard, where many family members, generations — this camp was 100 years old — so grandmothers, mothers, kids, have all gone there.” The mother of three added that her mom, Laura, was a “drama counselor” at Camp Mystic and shared that “many of my friends had their kids there last week.” The Texas native, whose father was previously a governor of Texas, added that the stories she's heard coming out of Texas have been “beautiful and heartbreaking.” More in Celebrity Bush Hager shares her three children with husband Henry Chase Hager.

mov_83B03F5FAA813FFED9238143FD72D71C,"  Going into Amazon's longest Prime Day event yet, Adobe Analytics projects consumers will spend $23.8 billion on ecommerce sites between July 8 and July 11. The longer Prime Day event also comes as U.S. retailers navigate tariffs and could be a strategic play to mitigate their effects. Over the past few years, Amazon's Prime Day event has had reverberations in ecommerce, leading other retailers to hold their own promotional periods to generate sales. In 2024, consumers spent $7 billion online outside Amazon on the second day of the Prime Day event. Meanwhile, Amazon didn't share how much it generated in sales but did say it broke its own record. Adobe said it expects four key trends to define the sales period: Steeper discounts An increase in back-to-school shopping Continued growth in buy now, pay later (BNPL) Increased impact of social media influencers on shopping behaviors “Strong spending during the Prime Day event will be driven by net-new demand, as opposed to higher prices,” Adobe said. “The Adobe Digital Price Index, which tracks online prices across 18 product categories, shows that ecommerce prices have fallen for 33 months — down 2.01% YoY in May 2025. Adobe's numbers are not adjusted for inflation, but if online inflation were factored in, there would be even higher growth in topline consumer spend. Adobe Analytics data is based on more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million SKUs and 18 product categories, according to the company. More than 200 online retailers in the Top 2000 use Adobe Analytics for their web analytics, and more than 100 use it for site design and development. Top 2000 online retailers also use it for content delivery and management, as an ecommerce platform, a marketing platform, for personalization and more. Key trends during Prime Day 2025 After Amazon announced dates for its summer Prime Day event, competitors Walmart and Target did the same, as did other players in the ecommerce space. Adobe expects paid search to “remain the top driver of retail sales” during Amazon's 2025 Prime Day event. It anticipates paid search accounting for about 28% of revenue, which would be up 1% to 3% year over year. It expects BNPL to drive between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion in overall online spending during Amazon's 2025 Prime Day sales event. That would represent an 8% share, up from 7.6% last year. For affiliates and partners — which include social media influencers — Adobe data indicates their share of revenue will be 19.9% on 16% year-over-year growth. Adobe said its data also shows that “influencers are set to convert shoppers (individuals making a purchase after seeing influencer content) 10 times more than social media overall.” Amazon ranks No. 1 in Digital Commerce 360's Top 2000 Database. The database is how Digital Commerce 360 tracks the largest North American online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales. Walmart ranks No. 2 and Target is No. 3. Amazon is also No. 3 in Digital Commerce 360's Global Online Marketplaces Database. That database ranks the 100 largest global marketplaces by third-party gross merchandise value (GMV). Walmart ranks No. 8 in that database, and Target is No. 64. Amazon is among the “Big Four” Mass Merchants that Digital Commerce 360 covers in depth as part of the State of American Ecommerce Report. Prime Day 2025 sales projection Adobe referred to Amazon's Prime Day event as “Black Friday in the summer.” The $23.8 billion projection that Adobe anticipates Prime Day 2025 to generate in U.S. ecommerce sales would be 28.4% year-over-year growth. It would also be $9.6 billion more than the Amazon Prime Day sales event in 2024. Adobe notes that if its projection is correct, the summer Amazon Prime Day event would generate the equivalent of two 2024 Black Fridays — it drove $10.8 billion in ecommerce sales. And similar to the overall 2024 holiday shopping season, Adobe expects mobile shopping to hit an all-time high, driving 52.5% of U.S. online sales during the event. That would be about $12.5 billion. Overall, Adobe projects U.S. retailers' discounts to be 10% to 24% off listed prices, with the apparel category having the largest deals at 24% (which compares to 20% for the category last year). Other categories Adobe expects to have large discounts include: Electronics at 22% (vs. 23%) Televisions at 17% (vs. 16%) Appliances at 16% (vs. 14%) Toys at 15% (vs. 15%) Furniture at 14% (vs. 16%) Computers at 12% (vs. 11%) Sporting goods at 10% (vs. 11%). Additionally, Adobe expects those discounts to lead consumers to “trade up” to higher-ticket items. It sees the share of the most expensive goods increasing by 18% compared to average year-to-date levels. In the electronics category, that share could rise by 52%, Adobe said....","Going into Amazon's longest Prime Day event yet, Adobe Analytics projects consumers will spend $23.8 billion on ecommerce sites between July 8 and July 11.

mov_3AB4B7F869D336842BDA58FB9AD4AD2C,"  YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio – Millennial Theatre Company will present “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” on July 11-13 and 18-20 at the Youngstown Playhouse. Curtain times are 7:30 p.m. Fridays and Saturday and 2:30 p.m. Sundays. Tickets start at $25 and are available at MillennialTheatre.org and by phone at 330 259 9651. Those who have seen “Joseph” before will find new surprises in this production, according to director Joe Asente. “We knew going into this that Youngstown audiences were very familiar with this show,” he said. “Between the universally beloved Donny Osmond film version and the rich history of this show being produced locally on a Broadway-scale by Easy Street Productions, there was a built-in expectation of what audiences would want to see from this show. We tried very hard to honor and meet those expectations, while also sprinkling in a few of our own new, creative twists throughout.” Asente said he has taken new directions with several of the characters by updating their references. “Dreamcoat” is an ideal choice for a summer musical, he added. “In the summer, we always try to program shows that you can bring your kids and family to, and there are few musicals more family-oriented than 'Joseph,'” Asente said. The cast features Samuel Darrin, Kate DeL, Colleen Chance, Holly Marshall, Terry Shears, Mikaylaa Moore, Ryan Stewart, Jillian Hibbard, Paula Staphenson, Alexander Chapman, Ethan Blevins, Sam Campbell, Rebecca Williams, Liam Burke, Kali Davies-Anderson, Ben Doss, Michelle Jalbert, Amelia Mihalik, Kate Klug, Danny Stephenson, Ashley Tirak, Natalie Horvath, Naomi Horvath, Nora Horvath, Katie Kurdziel, Megan Delaney, Charlotte Anderson, Zoe Bayer, Carlina Carbon, Scarlett Carbon, Annabeth Davidson, Zaina Haidar, Riley Hibbard, Scarlett Hibbard, Sarah Horkey, Spencer Miller, Sawyer Miller, Amaya Slipski, Makenna Slipski and Aleeya Williams. Choreography is by Danielle Mentzer, with musical direction by Megan Miller. One of the most enduring shows of all time, “Dreamcoat” is a reimagining of the Biblical story of Joseph, his father, Jacob, his 11 brothers and the coat of many colors. Told entirely through song with the help of a  narrator, the musical follows the preferred son,  Joseph. After being sold into slavery by his brothers, he ingratiates himself with Egyptian noble Potiphar but ends up in jail after refusing the amorous advances of Potiphar's wife. While imprisoned, Joseph discovers his ability to interpret dreams, and he soon finds himself in front of the mighty Pharaoh. Joseph's solution to Egypt's famine elevates him to Pharaoh's right-hand man and reunites him with his family.

mov_BFB776E9F5CA993808522FDCCB65C6E6,"  Greta Thunberg's little-known sister has spoken out about her relationship with the climate activist in rare comments after footage of her singing went viral. Bea Ernman, 19, told Swedish outlet Hänt that she was finding her time in the limelight 'fun' after MailOnline revealed how she had changed her name and was pursuing a career as a performer. She acknowledged she is often mentioned in the same breath as her famous older sister, 22, who made international headlines last month as she tried to sail to Gaza to deliver humanitarian aid in an audacious awareness campaign. Asked how she feels about the comparisons, she reflected: 'I think it happens to all people who are in the spotlight. 'But there you have such different things you do and you have completely different careers, so in the end it will be very different.' The young singer was pithy in her assessment of how they were as people: 'Very different.' Ernman came out of the shadows earlier this summer when she shared clips of herself singing in Stockholm. She said she has been performing since childhood and at the age of just 19-years-old is now putting the final touches on her first album. 'It's very cocky,' she told Hänt. ' I want people to feel uplifted when they listen to it.' The album is expected to be released later this year. Previously known as Beata Thunberg, the performer has started using her mother's maiden name, perhaps in an effort to put some distance between herself and her controversial older sibling, or echo the artistic flair running through the family. Bea's mother is Malena Ernman, a former Eurovision contestant and mezzo-soprano opera singer. Her father is Swedish film producer and screenwriter, Svante Thunberg. Bea is following in the footsteps of her successful parents - and sister - while insisting she wants to carve her own path. She acknowledged the attention can be overwhelming, but said that being an artist is 'about being seen, being on stage and getting attention'. While the Thunberg sisters have not shied away from building public profiles, Greta has in the past recognised the strain it can take. In 2019, she acknowledged the toll her work took on her sister when she admitted, 'the one who suffers is my sister'. 'The people who write threats and hate to me do it to the whole family, even to her. 'The difference between me and the people who are left at home is that I am always travelling, inaccessible. People don't know where I am staying, where I sleep at night, where I am. I have no daily life. 'But for my sister at home, who tries to have a daily life … she is much more reachable.' Bea, now old enough to embark on her own journey, judged that her 'voice was built from pain' as she reflected on a recent performance at Stockholm's Musikaliska - the same concert hall where Albert Einstein received his Nobel Prize over a century ago. She revealed on Instagram that the path to becoming a star has not been easy. Some in the audience 'looked scared' while others 'covered their ears', she said. Still a teenager, she has already built up enough resilience to take it on the chin. 'I don't care if people love my artistry or hate it, as long as I make them feel something,' she wrote. ' Not pity. Love or hate. That's the point of being an artist.' Greta has been supportive and protective of her little sister in the few comments made publicly. After Bea performed a rendition of her single Bara Du Vill (a Swedish phrase that translates to 'Only if you want') on Swedish TV in 2019, Greta plugged the song on her own Instagram and expressed admiration for 'my super talented sister' on Facebook. She reiterated her stance months later, while calling for kindness towards Beata. After her famous speech at the United Nations climate summit made her a household name, Greta - then 16 - told Swedish news outlet Dagens Nyheter how her 'wonderful and strong' sister had to bear the brunt of her activism work. Despite the hateful messages that were directed at Beata, she continued supporting Greta by showing up for the older Thunberg's Fridays for Future - or School Strike for Climate - action that turned the spotlight on the Swedish activist in 2018. In 2020, Beata was cast opposite her mother when she was chosen to play a young Edith Piaf in a musical, Malena depicting the French singer in her later years. 'I have been dancing and singing for as long as I can remember,' Beata reacted to the casting announcement, according to news agency DPA. 'To be able to perform her immortal music is a dream come true,' she said, referring to the iconic songstress Piaf. Greta has taken a vastly different path, becoming a recognisable face at the front of a number of activist campaigns. Thunberg shot to fame aged 15, in 2018, when she started skipping school in protest of Sweden's climate policies. Her School Strike for Climate garnered international attention, building a platform for the teenager to go on pressuring world leaders to do more to mitigate the impacts of climate change. More recently, Greta has piled criticism on Israel for its conduct in the war with Hamas in Gaza, and in June sailed from Sicily towards the beleaguered Palestinian enclave in an effort to raise awareness and deliver a symbolic amount of aid to the civilian population. Greta, and the 11 crew on board the Madleen, were apprehended by the IDF and detained before being deported.","Greta Thunberg's little-known sister has spoken out about her relationship with the climate activist in rare comments after footage of her singing went viral. Bea Ernman, 19, told Swedish outlet Hänt that she was finding her time in the limelight 'fun' after MailOnline revealed how she had changed her name and was pursuing a career as a performer. She acknowledged she is often mentioned in the same breath as her famous older sister, 22, who made international headlines last month as she tried to sail to Gaza to deliver humanitarian aid in an audacious awareness campaign. Asked how she feels about the comparisons, she reflected: 'I think it happens to all people who are in the spotlight. 'But there you have such different things you do and you have completely different careers, so in the end it will be very different.' The young singer was pithy in her assessment of how they were as people: 'Very different.' Ernman came out of the shadows earlier this summer when she shared clips of herself singing in Stockholm. She said she has been performing since childhood and at the age of just 19-years-old is now putting the final touches on her first album. 'It's very cocky,' she told Hänt. ' I want people to feel uplifted when they listen to it.' The album is expected to be released later this year. Previously known as Beata Thunberg, the performer has started using her mother's maiden name, perhaps in an effort to put some distance between herself and her controversial older sibling, or echo the artistic flair running through the family. Bea's mother is Malena Ernman, a former Eurovision contestant and mezzo-soprano opera singer. Her father is Swedish film producer and screenwriter, Svante Thunberg.

mov_74CB11B582C44552A319310E94EB6E8F,"  The Chi season 7 premiered on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME on May 16, 2025. It promises a dozen new episodes, with one episode to be released every week on Fridays. While the show has explored various storylines over the years, its story remains focused on the complexities of the Black community in the South Side of Chicago. Showtime's hit series The Chi season 7 was filmed and produced entirely in the city of Chicago. In that sense. It gives an authentic look and feel of the city and its culture that is the very essence of the story told by the show, because the series is set in Chicago. Lena Waithe's The Chi is all about the lives of the residents of the Chi neighborhood and the complexity in the Black community. Find out more about the show below, including where it was filmed. The city of Chicago has been the center of The Chi's filming and production since it debuted on SHOWTIME in January 2018, and its namesake city remains the primary backdrop for the new season. The filming for The Chi season 7 reportedly kicked off in May 2014 and went on until October of that same year. From the show's IMDb page, there were no specific areas where the series was filmed in the city. However, it also listed the Cinespace Chicago Film Studios as one of its shooting locations, which was most likely utilized for filming various indoor and outdoor scenes for the series. Cinespace has filming studios in various locations, including Chicago, Atlanta, Toronto, and Wilmington. It has been the shooting location of choice for many TV shows, like The Summer I Turned Pretty, Hulu's The Handmaid's Tale, and Stranger Things, to name a few. The Chicago studio, where The Chi season 7 was filmed, boasts a 1.6 million square-foot area with 36 active stages and two campuses. All of these are conveniently located 15 minutes from downtown, per their website. In The Chi season 7, there will be plenty of power struggles and a quest for revenge. Some of the deaths at the tail end of the last season will fuel some of the storylines in season 7, including Alicia trying to find justice for her son Rob's murder. Here's what the new season will be about, per the synopsis: Here are the main cast and characters returning for the seventh season of the series: After his character died in The Chi season 6, Curtiss Cook will not be returning as Douda in season 7. Other former cast members like Alex R. Hibbert, Tyla Abercrumbie, and Miriam A. Hyman won't be returning as well.

The stepdaughter of Travis Barker dropped an eye-popping snapshot on her Stories that has caught the attention of her social media fans. Atiana flaunted her killer physique in a tiny two-piece that bared her enviable curves. Atiana De La Hoya Takes A Dip In The Pool View this post on Instagram A post shared by Atiana De La Hoya (@atianadelahoya) The photo showed the 26-year-old lounging on a rectangular pool floatie featuring stripes and a checkered print in yellow, white, and green. She lay on her back along the edge of the inflatable but kept her upper body up using both arms. The socialite stretched her right leg and planted her left foot on the ledge. As if her scanty two-piece wasn't enough to tantalize her online audience, Atiana amped up the ante by tugging on her bikini bottoms. She also raised her chin to the sky while enjoying the sunshine, which cast a beautiful glow on her flawlessly tanned complexion. Bikini Body On Display  Instagram Stories | Atiana De La Hoya Atiana wore an olive green number that popped against her sun-kissed body. The top's triangle cups were so tiny that she spilled out from the sides -- exposing a hint of sideboob. Its low-cut neckline also displayed an ample amount of her cleavage, which was enhanced by the tight fit of the garment. The thin white straps were secured over her neck while the lower strings wrapped around her midriff. The model sported matching bottoms that were even more risqué than the top half of her look. Her scanty swimwear had high-leg cuts that helped accentuate her hips and hourglass silhouette. The front side dipped several inches below her navel, highlighting Atiana's taut tummy. Letting It All Hang View this post on Instagram A post shared by Atiana De La Hoya (@atianadelahoya) For the pool session, Atiana ditched the accessories to let her bikini body do all the talking. Despite posting the pic on a Monday, Atiana wrote, ""SUMMMERRR Fridays."" Some fans took the opportunity to shower the socialite with praise. ""Heating up summer I see,"" wrote one admirer, while another fan, who may have mentioned Atiana's half sister on her mother's side, remarked, ""Hotter than Alabama."" Atiana De La Hoya's Relationship With Stepdad Travis Barker View this post on Instagram A post shared by travisbarker (@travisbarker) Atiana is the daughter of Travis' ex-wife, Shanna Moakler, and the famous boxer, Oscar De La Hoya. The former exes' other children include Landon, 21, and Alabama, 22. Despite not being a biological child of Travis, he treats her like one of his own. Through the years, Atiana maintains a close relationship with her stepdad and her siblings, even when Travis and Shanna have broken up. Oscar De La Hoya Praises Travis Barker MEGA In July 2023, the legendary boxer opened up on why he let Shanna and Travis raise his daughter, Atiana. ""I basically ran away,"" De La Hoya admitted on the Allison Interviews podcast on July 20. ""I was scared. I was fearful. I did try to be a father full-time for a few years, and it was beautiful. It was amazing to raise a little girl but there came a point where you say to yourself, 'Wait a minute. You're not worthy of this.'"" De La Hoya also expressed his gratitude to the Blink-182 drummer for being a ""father figure"" to Atiana. ""I have to give credit where credit is due, and I'm grateful that Barker was there, you know, as a father figure to my daughter,"" he said. ""I have to be thankful that Shanna was a mother to Atiana, and I know my place, basically. My place, I obviously am a father, and I'm proud of that,"" De La Hoya continued.

mov_EEBA88824189E6D74A2C15F630DD02B8,"  Spokane cook Suwanee Lennon admits initial nerves about facing TV cameras for ""The Great American Recipe"" on PBS. Lennon landed a spot among eight contestants in the show's fourth season, scheduled locally at 6 p.m. Friday. Other weekly segments run Fridays through Aug. 15. Raised until age 13 in a leprosy village in Surin - a northeastern province of Thailand - Lennon loves the bold Isaan cuisine she now embraces for creating recipes. Her blog, Simply Suwanee, offers tips to home cooks to ease into Thai cooking. The show's team reached out to her. ""I didn't expect this; it just came out of nowhere,"" said Lennon, 47. Before her Nashville trip in fall 2024 for filming, Lennon said, she realized that the show offered a larger stage to share about her Thailand village and its residents. ""After some talking and thinking, I just knew this was bigger than me,"" she said. ""It was about me telling my story and the story of the people I grew up with. ""I wanted to go on the show for them and to showcase my culture, Thai food and the country I grew up in."" The PBS competition highlights a variety of tastes and traditions from around the U.S., while delving into the personal stories behind the home cooks' signature dishes. This season brings influences from Bangladeshi to Belizean, Puerto Rican to Southern flavor, Cajun to Afghan, and Filipino to Lennon's Thai dishes. Host Alejandra Ramos is joined by chefs and restaurateurs Tiffany Derry and Timothy Hollingsworth, along with ""Splendid Table"" host Francis Lam, as judges who guide the contestants. The opening episode includes guest judge Al Roker, TV weatherman, cookbook author and creator of an upcoming PBS KIDS series ""Weather Hunters."" Lennon, a photographer, sent in Thailand pictures to air on the show along with the stories she tells about her village. She first heard from ""The Great American Recipe"" staff via social media and email, initially mistaking it for spam. After a second email, she researched names and realized they were legitimate. Her follow-up call led to phone interviews, and Lennon said she felt comfortable from the start. She likes the show's storytelling and heritage. ""Eight of us were selected from around the country,"" Lennon said. ""We all competed against each other in the cuisine of our background, and with that, also the stories. ""I think that's the heart and soul of 'The Great America Recipe,' to share recipes we make in America, but they have a lot of heritage included with memories and families."" Each week, after two challenges, the judges determine who has the winning dish. For the finale, the top three cooks compete to win the national search for ""The Great American Recipe."" Lennon features signature dishes such as Khanom Jeen Nam Ya - also called Thai Fish Curry - and a spicy, herb-packed laab salad. ""Fish curry was a dish that I grew up with in Thailand, and the one I used when going back to feed the village,"" Lennon added. ""It's one of my favorite dishes of all time, the Khanom Jeen Nam Ya."" Lennon raises money for a campaign she began two years ago, Feed the Village Project, to give back to her hometown's elderly leprosy patients. Lennon has since made two trips to Thailand to help her community. She went alone in April 2023, when she and 15 women cooked enough food to feed the village for two days. In 2024, her children raised money with a Thai tea stand and art projects to benefit children in the village. They joined their mom on a return trip a year ago, in summer 2024. Lennon was born in Bangkok to a young, unwed mother, who didn't tell her American soldier boyfriend about the pregnancy. Unable to care for a baby, her mom took Lennon to a sister. Lennon was raised by that aunt and uncle, both who had leprosy. The Thailand government about 70 years ago built 14 leprosy villages, each gated and isolated, she said. Younger generations, including Lennon, don't have the disease but they saw the stigma faced by older residents. That's true even now, said Lennon, who went to school outside of the village. An American woman, who visited her village with a Thai doctor, later sponsored her journey to the U.S. at age 13. Before Lennon left her village, many of the residents gave her gifts and small bills, although they were poor. Lennon, who first lived in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, eventually married an Air Force pilot.

Raised until age 13 in a leprosy village in Surin - a northeastern province of Thailand - Lennon loves the bold Isaan cuisine she now embraces for creating recipes.

Before her Nashville trip in fall 2024 for filming, Lennon said, she realized that the show offered a larger stage to share about her Thailand village and its residents. ""After some talking and thinking, I just knew this was bigger than me,"" she said. ""It was about me telling my story and the story of the people I grew up with. ""I wanted to go on the show for them and to showcase my culture, Thai food and the country I grew up in."" The PBS competition highlights a variety of tastes and traditions from around the U.S., while delving into the personal stories behind the home cooks' signature dishes.

Host Alejandra Ramos is joined by chefs and restaurateurs Tiffany Derry and Timothy Hollingsworth, along with ""Splendid Table"" host Francis Lam, as judges who guide the contestants.

Her follow-up call led to phone interviews, and Lennon said she felt comfortable from the start. She likes the show's storytelling and heritage. ""Eight of us were selected from around the country,"" Lennon said. ""We all competed against each other in the cuisine of our background, and with that, also the stories. ""I think that's the heart and soul of 'The Great America Recipe,' to share recipes we make in America, but they have a lot of heritage included with memories and families."" Each week, after two challenges, the judges determine who has the winning dish. For the finale, the top three cooks compete to win the national search for ""The Great American Recipe."" Lennon features signature dishes such as Khanom Jeen Nam Ya - also called Thai Fish Curry - and a spicy, herb-packed laab salad.

""It's one of my favorite dishes of all time, the Khanom Jeen Nam Ya."" Lennon raises money for a campaign she began two years ago, Feed the Village Project, to give back to her hometown's elderly leprosy patients. Lennon has since made two trips to Thailand to help her community. She went alone in April 2023, when she and 15 women cooked enough food to feed the village for two days. In 2024, her children raised money with a Thai tea stand and art projects to benefit children in the village. They joined their mom on a return trip a year ago, in summer 2024. Lennon was born in Bangkok to a young, unwed mother, who didn't tell her American soldier boyfriend about the pregnancy. Unable to care for a baby, her mom took Lennon to a sister. Lennon was raised by that aunt and uncle, both who had leprosy. The Thailand government about 70 years ago built 14 leprosy villages, each gated and isolated, she said.

Raised until age 13 in a leprosy village in Surin - a northeastern province of Thailand - Lennon loves the bold Isaan cuisine she now embraces for creating recipes. Her blog, Simply Suwanee, offers tips to home cooks to ease into Thai cooking. The show's team reached out to her. ""I didn't expect this; it just came out of nowhere,"" said Lennon, 47. Before her Nashville trip in fall 2024 for filming, Lennon said, she realized that the show offered a larger stage to share about her Thailand village and its residents. ""After some talking and thinking, I just knew this was bigger than me,"" she said. ""It was about me telling my story and the story of the people I grew up with. ""I wanted to go on the show for them and to showcase my culture, Thai food and the country I grew up in."" The PBS competition highlights a variety of tastes and traditions from around the U.S., while delving into the personal stories behind the home cooks' signature dishes. This season brings influences from Bangladeshi to Belizean, Puerto Rican to Southern flavor, Cajun to Afghan, and Filipino to Lennon's Thai dishes. Host Alejandra Ramos is joined by chefs and restaurateurs Tiffany Derry and Timothy Hollingsworth, along with ""Splendid Table"" host Francis Lam, as judges who guide the contestants. The opening episode includes guest judge Al Roker, TV weatherman, cookbook author and creator of an upcoming PBS KIDS series ""Weather Hunters."" Lennon, a photographer, sent in Thailand pictures to air on the show along with the stories she tells about her village. She first heard from ""The Great American Recipe"" staff via social media and email, initially mistaking it for spam. After a second email, she researched names and realized they were legitimate. Her follow-up call led to phone interviews, and Lennon said she felt comfortable from the start. She likes the show's storytelling and heritage. ""Eight of us were selected from around the country,"" Lennon said. ""We all competed against each other in the cuisine of our background, and with that, also the stories. ""I think that's the heart and soul of 'The Great America Recipe,' to share recipes we make in America, but they have a lot of heritage included with memories and families."" Each week, after two challenges, the judges determine who has the winning dish. For the finale, the top three cooks compete to win the national search for ""The Great American Recipe."" Lennon features signature dishes such as Khanom Jeen Nam Ya - also called Thai Fish Curry - and a spicy, herb-packed laab salad. ""Fish curry was a dish that I grew up with in Thailand, and the one I used when going back to feed the village,"" Lennon added. ""It's one of my favorite dishes of all time, the Khanom Jeen Nam Ya."" Lennon raises money for a campaign she began two years ago, Feed the Village Project, to give back to her hometown's elderly leprosy patients. Lennon has since made two trips to Thailand to help her community. She went alone in April 2023, when she and 15 women cooked enough food to feed the village for two days. In 2024, her children raised money with a Thai tea stand and art projects to benefit children in the village. They joined their mom on a return trip a year ago, in summer 2024. Lennon was born in Bangkok to a young, unwed mother, who didn't tell her American soldier boyfriend about the pregnancy. Unable to care for a baby, her mom took Lennon to a sister. Lennon was raised by that aunt and uncle, both who had leprosy. The Thailand government about 70 years ago built 14 leprosy villages, each gated and isolated, she said. Younger generations, including Lennon, don't have the disease but they saw the stigma faced by older residents. That's true even now, said Lennon, who went to school outside of the village. An American woman, who visited her village with a Thai doctor, later sponsored her journey to the U.S. at age 13. Before Lennon left her village, many of the residents gave her gifts and small bills, although they were poor. Lennon, who first lived in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, eventually married an Air Force pilot. Now a cargo airline pilot, he retired from the military in 2022. At home in Spokane, they have a son, 12, and daughter, 10. Every four to six weeks, Lennon is a chef for a day to cook at Spokane's Feast World Kitchen, a nonprofit restaurant. That work has helped her boost her fundraising. ""When my husband retired from the Air Force, I decided I'm going to pursue this dream of feeding the village, of feeding the people who have given me so much, with the little they have,"" she said. ""Last year was bigger than expected because I was able to raise a lot more money. ""I was able to raise money to support my project and not just feed more people, but we also incorporated my kids in where we raised money for (village) school supplies and uniforms. We also built a house for a family of five and helped with different things in the village, like the solar lights that were broken for years.""...",2025-07-09 15:09:13,en,WEB,,,,cluster_5,4,False,False,"The text is a detailed article about a Thai-American cook named Suwanee Lennon and her participation in ""The Great American Recipe"" TV show.

Froedtert South Hospital in Pleasant Prairie is planning to add a 50,000 square foot, four story addition to its current site. Plans for the expansion were approved by the Pleasant Prairie Plan Commission during a meeting Monday A major expansion including an emergency medical services training facility is coming to Froedtert South Hospital in Pleasant Prairie. The hospital plans to add a 50,000 square-foot, four-story addition to the current hospital at 9555 76th St., which will include a dedicated EMS training facility on the first floor and space for future clinical expansion on the upper levels. Preliminary site and operational plans were approved during a Pleasant Prairie Plan Commission meeting Monday. It is tentatively schedule for start of construction by late summer, taking about 14 months to complete. The addition will take the space currently used for parking between the existing Emergency Department and Cancer Center, both of which will not be moved. The EMS training facility will provide hands-on education and simulation-based training for first responders and clinical personnel. People are also reading… ""The EMS Building is being built for all of the rescue squad members at all of our fire stations in Kenosha County as well as northern Illinois,"" said Froedteert South Hospital System President and CEO Ric Schmidt. ""The goal is for the EMS providers, predominantly paramedics and EMTs, to simulate real life experiences in a lab on simulation manikins that feel and respond virtually like human beings. ""The planning for the EMS Building is being steered by all of the chiefs and training chiefs in our service area so as to build a training center that we hope exactly meets their needs,"" Schmidt said. ""The labs can simulate being on the side of a busy highwa,y or in a bar or at an accident scene with all the visuals and sounds that one would experience if they were actually there."" He explained Froedtert South representatives have been meeting since 2024 with Kenosha County fire chiefs and fire training chiefs to get their input on the design, layout and equipment for the training facility. ""We are building this training facility specifically to meet their needs,"" Schmidt said. The facility is being designed to offer a comprehensive range of training opportunities, including basic life support certification, advanced cardiac life support certification, trauma life support certification, trauma response training and realistic simulation exercises. An accompanying training program is being developed to improve the skills and preparedness of EMS professionals and hospital staff through interaction with board-certified specialists and ongoing educational sessions. ""The lab will have extensive cameras and recording instruments which will permit a retrospective evaluation as to how the training exercise went,"" Schmidt said. Once constructed, the EMS training facility is projected to operate Mondays through Fridays from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., with potential weekend hours based on demand. When fully operational, the new facility is expected to add three to five new full-time and part-time positions. The upper three floors will be built but not initially outfitted. The space is meant for future clinical use, tailored to meet the needs of the community and the hospital, officials said. The expansion will include an additional entrance and connection to the main hospital on the first floor. Exterior building materials will be selected to match the existing building design to maintain a consistent architectural look throughout the entire facility. Hospital operations will continue uninterrupted throughout the construction period.

mov_9FA22C16F473CCD6EB1BDE359AFC3CD7,"  We are already beyond the halfway point of 2025 but it is great to see so many passengers coming through their local airport for a much-needed getaway. Whether it's a family holiday, a city break, or reconnecting with loved ones, Southampton Airport is proud to be the starting point for these important journeys. The summer marks the start of a busy travel season but 2025 has seen a lot of fantastic news coming from our airport. We are entering a new era, defined by strategic investment, innovation, and a renewed commitment to delivering an exceptional experience for every traveller. A transformational investment The recent acquisition of AGS Airports by AviAlliance, with Blackstone Infrastructure Partners joining as a minority investor, represents a significant milestone. This partnership brings with it more than £300m million investment plan across the AGS group, which includes Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Southampton airports. It is the single largest investment into our airport's since they came into existence, however this is not just a financial commitment—it's a clear endorsement of our long-term potential. The investment will support infrastructure upgrades, sustainability initiatives, and enhanced passenger services, ensuring we continue to meet the evolving needs of travellers and the region we serve. Enhancing the passenger experience One of the most immediate benefits passengers will notice is the rollout of Next Generation Security Screening (NGSS). This cutting-edge technology allows travellers to keep liquids and electronics in their hand luggage, significantly reducing wait times and streamlining the security process. Early feedback has been positive but the hard work doesn't stop there, we will continue to look for improvements so passengers can enjoy an efficient, comfortable and secure journey. Strengthening regional connectivity We're also delighted to announce that Loganair will establish a new base at Southampton Airport this October. This expansion will introduce new routes and increase connectivity across the UK and beyond, creating local jobs and supporting the regional economy. In addition, we've recently welcomed new services from easyJet to Paris and the airline has committed to starting a Barcelona route from our airport in October operating on a Monday and Fridays. There is always a buzz when a new service takes its first flight and the recent return of TUI after 15 years is a great example of this. It was a pleasure to see everyone excited about their trip to Palma. These developments reflect growing demand and our commitment to offering more choice to our passengers. Embracing innovation Our digital transformation continues with the launch of “Hello SOU,” an AI-powered assistant designed to provide real-time information and support to passengers. Whether it's flight updates or navigating airport services, this tool is part of our broader effort to enhance the travel experience through smart, user-friendly technology. Supporting our community Beyond the terminal, we remain deeply committed to our community. The newly launched Spitfire Wellbeing Fund has awarded its first grants to local organisations supporting mental health and wellbeing. This initiative honours the legacy of the Spitfire—born here in Southampton—and reflects our dedication to making a positive impact locally. We were also proud to host the return of our popular 5K Runway Run on 20th of July, raising funds for the Air Ambulance and bringing together runners of all ages for a unique experience on the tarmac. A focus on accessibility and quality Just a few weeks ago, we received word that we were ranked “Good” in the Civil Aviation Authority's annual Passenger Accessibility Report. The team work incredibly hard to ensure that air travel is for everyone and we remain committed to improving this facility so everyone – regardless of ability – feels welcome and supported at our airport. Meanwhile, our new partnership with SSP will transform our food and beverage offerings, bringing fresh, locally inspired options to our terminal and further enhancing the passenger experience. We'll have more on this soon but are looking forward to what our terminal will have to offer passengers. Looking ahead It was great to see our hard work be recognised by the National Transport Award judges as we received our first ever shortlisting in the Airport of the Year Category and we look forward to the evening in October. We are proud to serve as a gateway to the South Coast and beyond.","We are already beyond the halfway point of 2025 but it is great to see so many passengers coming through their local airport for a much-needed getaway. Whether it's a family holiday, a city break, or reconnecting with loved ones, Southampton Airport is proud to be the starting point for these important journeys. The summer marks the start of a busy travel season but 2025 has seen a lot of fantastic news coming from our airport. We are entering a new era, defined by strategic investment, innovation, and a renewed commitment to delivering an exceptional experience for every traveller. A transformational investment The recent acquisition of AGS Airports by AviAlliance, with Blackstone Infrastructure Partners joining as a minority investor, represents a significant milestone. This partnership brings with it more than £300m million investment plan across the AGS group, which includes Aberdeen, Glasgow, and Southampton airports. It is the single largest investment into our airport's since they came into existence, however this is not just a financial commitment—it's a clear endorsement of our long-term potential. The investment will support infrastructure upgrades, sustainability initiatives, and enhanced passenger services, ensuring we continue to meet the evolving needs of travellers and the region we serve. Enhancing the passenger experience One of the most immediate benefits passengers will notice is the rollout of Next Generation Security Screening (NGSS). This cutting-edge technology allows travellers to keep liquids and electronics in their hand luggage, significantly reducing wait times and streamlining the security process. Early feedback has been positive but the hard work doesn't stop there, we will continue to look for improvements so passengers can enjoy an efficient, comfortable and secure journey. Strengthening regional connectivity We're also delighted to announce that Loganair will establish a new base at Southampton Airport this October. This expansion will introduce new routes and increase connectivity across the UK and beyond, creating local jobs and supporting the regional economy. In addition, we've recently welcomed new services from easyJet to Paris and the airline has committed to starting a Barcelona route from our airport in October operating on a Monday and Fridays. There is always a buzz when a new service takes its first flight and the recent return of TUI after 15 years is a great example of this. It was a pleasure to see everyone excited about their trip to Palma. These developments reflect growing demand and our commitment to offering more choice to our passengers. Embracing innovation Our digital transformation continues with the launch of “Hello SOU,” an AI-powered assistant designed to provide real-time information and support to passengers. Whether it's flight updates or navigating airport services, this tool is part of our broader effort to enhance the travel experience through smart, user-friendly technology. Supporting our community Beyond the terminal, we remain deeply committed to our community. The newly launched Spitfire Wellbeing Fund has awarded its first grants to local organisations supporting mental health and wellbeing. This initiative honours the legacy of the Spitfire—born here in Southampton—and reflects our dedication to making a positive impact locally. We were also proud to host the return of our popular 5K Runway Run on 20th of July, raising funds for the Air Ambulance and bringing together runners of all ages for a unique experience on the tarmac. A focus on accessibility and quality Just a few weeks ago, we received word that we were ranked “Good” in the Civil Aviation Authority's annual Passenger Accessibility Report. The team work incredibly hard to ensure that air travel is for everyone and we remain committed to improving this facility so everyone – regardless of ability – feels welcome and supported at our airport.

mov_15B013CCDBFC7A208440BF9A3A685CD4,"  Michelin-recognized and hailed by the LA Times and New York Times, Filipino restaurant Spoon & Pork now finds itself in a battle just to keep the lights on. And they're not alone, according to a new report from NBC 4 News. Don't miss When Jay Tugas and Raymond Yaptinchay launched Spoon & Pork out of a food truck in 2017, they weren't just serving modern Filipino fare, they were introducing a culture. “When people enjoy the food, it touches our heart,” Tugas told the news station. “Because that's what we wanted to do, we wanted to introduce our dishes, our culture, to everyone.” By 2020, they had grown to two brick-and-mortar restaurants, one in Silver Lake, the other in Sawtelle Japantown. The rave reviews were rolling in. But now? “It's really tough, it's really hard,” Tugas said. “I had to let go of all my servers, and my kitchen staff. So now it's just me and my business partner Raymond.” 'What is going on?' Despite glowing 4-star reviews on Yelp and Google, Spoon & Pork is struggling to keep the lights on. In a social media clip, Tugas showed an empty dining room. “Sometimes it's just like, you know, it leaves my brain blank,” Tugas said. “Like what is going on?” More in Lifestyle “At the end of the day, it's more important for me to have people coming in than having the reviews,” he added. According to the report, Spoon & Pork's story echoes what many LA restaurant owners are experiencing. Recent closures are affecting everyone from buzzy newcomers to established favorites. “Everything's expensive, number one,” Tugas explains, “I think the taxes here are atrocious, we pay almost 30% after every sale. It's just crazy. Labor's very expensive.” Even for a Michelin-recognized kitchen, the math no longer adds up. Tugas believes the restaurant industry never truly recovered from COVID's economic wreckage. “We were like, 2020 is going to be awesome,” he recalls with tears in his eyes, “And then, come March, everything shuts down. So we've been really battling from that time, from the day we opened until now. It was a constant battle.” With government relief gone, prices rising, and consumer spending shrinking, many restaurants are hanging by a thread. “This one is not going to last,” Tugas says, “And I'm working hard for the other one to stay open as well.” Dining scene in trouble America's once-booming dining scene appears to be in trouble. Restaurants may be facing their worst financial squeeze since the pandemic with skyrocketing food and labor costs and a sharp decline in consumer spending. According to a KPMG survey, Americans plan to spend 7% less per month at restaurants this summer compared to fall 2024. “Nearly 70% say they're eating at home more often than last year, and 85% cite budget constraints as the top reason,” says the report. Fast food visits are up, while casual dining is down. Many chain restaurants are closing down locations. For example, TGI Fridays filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, reducing its U.S. locations to 85. Red Lobster, Hooters, Subway, Applebee's, Mod Pizza, and Buffalo Wild Wings have also scaled back significantly, closing dozens, sometimes hundreds, of units. Something contributing to the trouble may be the shift from in-person dining to delivery. An aftereffect of the pandemic is that consumers are more comfortable with getting takeout or delivery. Michael Kaufman from Harvard Business School told The Guardian that three-quarters of the restaurant traffic across the country is off-premises. “The majority of restaurant operators across all segments — including 90% of fine dining operators and 87% of casual dining operators — say building on-premises business is more important for their success than greater off-premises business,” says the National Restaurant Association. A Bank of America 2025 forecast says digital proficiency will continue to be a key differentiator.

The Catholic Charities St. Lucy Food Project gathers food year-round from many of the diocesan schools in the area. On Thursday (July 10), kids participating in summer camp at Bishop Ireton High School filled a box truck with canned fruit, vegetables, rice, and more. More than 1,200 pounds of food were collected at Bishop Ireton. “We're serving 24% more clients than last year,” James McCaskey, an outreach specialist from Catholic Charities St Lucy Food Project, told ALXnow. “It increased from 2022, which was just under 300,000 total food insecure individuals… and now we're at like 323,000 people.” The drive is part of the year-round organization's “Summer for Hungry Children” campaign. This fall, the St. Lucy Food Project will conduct its Fall Harvest drive, aiming to collect up to 60,000 pounds of food. More collections are scheduled for the coming days, and donations can also be made through the St. Lucy Food Project's Amazon wishlist. “It makes it a lot easier for people to donate remotely,” McCaskey said. “In the past month, we've received over 4,000 pounds just from Amazon wishlist donations.” Donations can also be dropped off at the Catholic Charities Alexandria food pantry at 4527A Eisenhower Avenue. Non-expired and unopened food donations are accepted on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The nonprofit needs the following: Breakfast cereals (in box) and instant or old-fashioned oatmeal (18 oz. or 42 oz.) Peanut butter (16 oz.) and jelly (15 oz. or 18 oz.) Canned meat (chicken, spam, corned beef, chili) Canned vegetables (corn, green beans, sweet peas, 15 oz.) Red kidney, black beans, or baked beans (15 oz.) Pasta: spaghetti and pasta sauce in can Canned fruits (15 oz.) Macaroni and cheese (7.25 oz.) Soup: Chunky, Progresso, or noodle soup Chicken broth (15 oz.) ; cream of mushroom soup (10.5 oz.) Diced tomatoes, stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce (15 oz.) Bagged rice (white or brown) Sugar (white or brown) Canola or vegetable oil (48 oz.) Canned pineapple (8 oz.)

On Thursday (July 10), kids participating in summer camp at Bishop Ireton High School filled a box truck with canned fruit, vegetables, rice, and more. More than 1,200 pounds of food were collected at Bishop Ireton. “We're serving 24% more clients than last year,” James McCaskey, an outreach specialist from Catholic Charities St Lucy Food Project, told ALXnow. “It increased from 2022, which was just under 300,000 total food insecure individuals… and now we're at like 323,000 people.” The drive is part of the year-round organization's “Summer for Hungry Children” campaign. This fall, the St. Lucy Food Project will conduct its Fall Harvest drive, aiming to collect up to 60,000 pounds of food. More collections are scheduled for the coming days, and donations can also be made through the St. Lucy Food Project's Amazon wishlist. “It makes it a lot easier for people to donate remotely,” McCaskey said. “In the past month, we've received over 4,000 pounds just from Amazon wishlist donations.” Donations can also be dropped off at the Catholic Charities Alexandria food pantry at 4527A Eisenhower Avenue. Non-expired and unopened food donations are accepted on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The nonprofit needs the following: Breakfast cereals (in box) and instant or old-fashioned oatmeal (18 oz. or 42 oz.) Peanut butter (16 oz.) and jelly (15 oz. or 18 oz.) Canned meat (chicken, spam, corned beef, chili) Canned vegetables (corn, green beans, sweet peas, 15 oz.) Red kidney, black beans, or baked beans (15 oz.) Pasta: spaghetti and pasta sauce in can Canned fruits (15 oz.) Macaroni and cheese (7.25 oz.) Soup: Chunky, Progresso, or noodle soup Chicken broth (15 oz.) ; cream of mushroom soup (10.5 oz.) Diced tomatoes, stewed tomatoes, tomato sauce (15 oz.) Bagged rice (white or brown) Sugar (white or brown) Canola or vegetable oil (48 oz.) Canned pineapple (8 oz.) Ramen noodles Single serving fruit juice Shelf stable milk, unsweetened: Almond or soy Canned yam, canned cranberry (15 oz.) Boxed stuffing and instant mashed potatoes Snacks, crackers, cookies, and granola bars Grocery gift cards from Giant or Aldi In the meantime, ALIVE! is also trying to collect 40,000 pounds of food in Alexandria by July 30.

The Broadway musical is based on Disney's 1992 film of the same name, which starred young actors Christian Bale and Christian Slater as the newsboys opposite Ann-Margaret as a nightclub singer, Bill Pullman as a determined newspaper reporter and Robert Duvall as Pulitzer. The stage version added seven new songs by the original team of Alan Menken and Jack Feldman while keeping many of the beloved songs from the film, including “Carrying the Banner,” “Seize the Day,” “King of New York” and “Santa Fe” during the two-and-a-half-hour tale of triumph. Performances are 7 p.m. Friday and Saturday, July 18, 19, 25 and 26, and 2 p.m. Sundays July 20 and 27, at Holdcraft Performing Arts Center, 1200 Spring St. in Michigan City.

mov_AA7AACF903007AC6F07C9DC7A8C17003,"  Brits are being warned over the busiest days to travel abroad this summer, following shocking new data that highlights just how jam-packed UK airports will be over the coming weeks Hundreds of thousands of Brits will be jetting abroad this summer, as UK airports across the nation brace for a record-breaking rush. Despite spreading wildfires, escalating anti-tourist sentiment, and the cost-of-living crisis still hitting cash-strapped Brits - many of us refuse to part with our beloved summer holiday. Whether you're heading for a booze-fuelled week in Benidorm, or plan on eating your body weight in feta cheese while exploring the picturesque Greek islands - surveys have found that around 55 per cent of Brits have or intend to book an overseas holiday this year. For those restricted to school term time, travelling in the peak summer months is their only option - despite spiralling costs and intense temperatures. In the past, this has resulted in huge traffic jams, long queues in security, and jam-packed airports. According to aviation data from Cirium shared with The Independent, flying on a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday could be your best bet - as these days tend to be much quieter than Fridays, Sundays, and Mondays. This particularly applies to London Heathrow Airport - the UK's biggest aviation hub - which is slated to handle a whopping 685 flights on the last Friday of August. Heathrow has not confirmed how many passengers will be flying through the airport on this particular day, but Cirium states it could be as high as 151,155. It's a similar story for London Gatwick, which is slated for a five-day rush in August where there will be more than 900 flights. ""The air-traffic controllers will have their work cut out on the first two Sundays, 3 and 10 August, with 904 flights on both days,"" The Independent states. ""The peak day for people [is] Sunday 17 August, with more than 160,000 passing through."" Up in the north, and things aren't much calmer. Manchester, the UK's third busiest airport following Heathrow and Gatwick, is bracing to handle a staggering 115,000 outbound and inbound passengers on Friday, August 22. The airport is highly popular amongst Brits wanting cheap flights to European hotspots such as Spain and Turkey. Edinburgh has already witnessed its 'busiest day' which is likely due to differences in when schools break up for the summer holidays in Scotland. On Friday, July 11, the airport was thought to have handled around 61,636 passengers.

mov_A5FC0DBCDEB3B8B8C6ABA314155B6095,"  July 10th, 2025 ( Newsbusters.org  - Delivered by  Newstex ) The left-wing media'shysteria revolving around the Immigration and CustomsEnforcement'sarrests and deportations nationwidehadcrankedupto the nextlevel.OnThursday'seditionof MSNBC'sMorning Joe,co-host of MSNBC'sTheWeekendSymone Sanders-Townsendclaimed people will see 'racial profiling' as ICE continuedto uphold the law.Meanwhile, another claimed ICE was 'kidnapping' people. Co-anchorJonathan Lemire framed the segment around fear of 'high profile clashes' in 'Democratic controlled cities' in thecountry, whereICE was focusing their efforts. It'sworth noting that citieslike Los Angeles,with Democratleadership,wereplaces that supported illegal immigration via their so-called sanctuary city polices. It's no wonder why ICE was in those places. As theformerSenior Advisor and Chief Spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris,Sander-Townsendmade statementsregardingICE's motivation for the arreststhat boiled down them just being racist: Yeah, this is about to bevery clear.It'sabout race.It'snot necessarily about risk because we have seen ICE go into disproportionately communities of color, disproportionately Latino and Hispanic. And I would also argue I would also note black and brown, black communities and go to courthouses...This is about, at this point, meeting a particular arbitrary quota, frankly, that the White House care of Stephen Miller has set forward. And we are going to continue as we get closer anddeeper and deeperinto the summer, as we go into the fall to see racial profiling. The factswerethatit's easierfor people who livedin LatinAmericaandSouth America to travel north, whichwaswhy Latinos andHispanics contribute to a major population of illegal immigrants.That fact wascompletely taken out of context forthe purpose ofwhat ICEwasfor.ICEwasnot arresting people based on their race, butratheriftheywere in the country illegally. The liberal mediahaveshown supportand sympathy towards illegal immigrants receiving thesame privilegesasAmerican citizens,andthey have forgotten that ICE wasestablishedtouphold the law andprotect thecountry. Former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki contributed to theconversation by suggesting that ICE was 'kidnapping' people. She also whined about them arresting people who lost the cases in immigration court: They are going into communities where peopledon'thave criminal records or people arelaw-abiding, even people who are going to their court hearingsandthey'retargeting people...So when they say they're going after the worst of the worst and the hardest of the hardest, what they'reactuallydoingto meet that, try to meet that 3000 number thatStephen Miller and others have set is they're going after what they consider low hanging fruit. People who arelaw-abiding, some who pay taxes, who are going to courtrooms to meet that number, andthey'regoing into citieslike L.A. to create a visionof chaosasif they are there to calm things, whenreallythey are the ones who are creating the chaos.Sothis is quite performative. Jen, theybrokethelaw ifthey were here illegally.Defending illegal immigrants as 'law-abiding' is hypocritical. Between 'racial profiling,''kidnapping,'and not getting the concept of the word illegal, the liberal mediapushedthe agenda that ICEwasthevillainfor keeping America safe and upholding thelaw. Meanwhile,they promotedthosewhowere hereillegally. Click here for the transcript. MSNBC's Morning Joe 7/10/25 9:24 a.m. Eastern JONATHAN LEMIRE: And Jen Psaki, a Trump official yesterday telling me that because the border is basically been closed, you know, that the heat, this this official suggests they're victim of their own success. Therefore it's not easy to find these deportations. You know, that's because they have to therefore go into the cities to make their numbers. And that's what I think is being telegraphed here is those, as Julia mentioned, those high profile clashes in Los Angeles, those ICE agents there leading to protests. President Trump has all but telegraphed that this summer we should expect a lot more of that in cities, particularly Democratic controlled cities across the country. JEN PSAKI: Well, I also think it's quite performative, Jonathan. I mean, they are - they have National Guard troops they shouldn't be using in this way. They are going into communities where people don't have criminal records or people are law abiding, even people who are going to their court hearings and they're targeting people. A lot of the reporting I've seen lately has been about 50 percent. I don't know what the exact latest numbers, but about 50 percent of the people who they are arresting, some of them kidnaping, some of them deporting are not, don't have any record at all. So when they say they're going after the worst of the worst and the hardest of the hardest, what they're actually doing to meet that - try to meet that 3,000 number that Stephen Miller and others have set, is they're going after what they consider low hanging fruit. People who are law abiding, some who pay taxes, who are going to courtrooms to meet that number. And they're going into cities like L.A. to create a vision of chaos as if they are there to calm things, when really they are the ones who are creating the chaos. So this is quite performative. It's also about trying to hit these numbers and not going after people who are doing anything in society aside from being law abiding. SYMONE SANDERS-TOWNSEND: Yeah, this is about - to be very clear. It's about race. It's not necessarily about risk because we have seen ICE go into disproportionately communities of color, disproportionately Latino and Hispanic. And I would also argue - I would also note black and brown -black communities and go to courthouses. We've seen them target traffic stops. We have seen viral videos of ICE approaching people in their yards. This is about, at this point, meeting a particular arbitrary quota, frankly, that the White House care of Stephen Miller has set forward. And we are going to continue as we get closer and deeper and deeper into the summer, as we go into the fall to see racial profiling. And we're going to see these stories come out more and more. And I have to wonder what local municipalities, but also Congress and just law abiding citizens think about this? Are we a country where we are comfortable, where we are going to racially profile people who are here based on the color of their skin, because Stephen Miller and the President wanted me to quota? That's the question we have to ask ourselves. MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Symone Sanders-Townsend, thank you....","July 10th, 2025 ( Newsbusters.org - Delivered by Newstex ) The left-wing media'shysteria revolving around the Immigration and CustomsEnforcement'sarrests and deportations nationwidehadcrankedupto the nextlevel.OnThursday'seditionof MSNBC'sMorning Joe,co-host of MSNBC'sTheWeekendSymone Sanders-Townsendclaimed people will see 'racial profiling' as ICE continuedto uphold the law.Meanwhile, another claimed ICE was 'kidnapping' people. Co-anchorJonathan Lemire framed the segment around fear of 'high profile clashes' in 'Democratic controlled cities' in thecountry, whereICE was focusing their efforts. It'sworth noting that citieslike Los Angeles,with Democratleadership,wereplaces that supported illegal immigration via their so-called sanctuary city polices. It's no wonder why ICE was in those places. As theformerSenior Advisor and Chief Spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris,Sander-Townsendmade statementsregardingICE's motivation for the arreststhat boiled down them just being racist: Yeah, this is about to bevery clear.It'sabout race.It'snot necessarily about risk because we have seen ICE go into disproportionately communities of color, disproportionately Latino and Hispanic. And I would also argue I would also note black and brown, black communities and go to courthouses...This is about, at this point, meeting a particular arbitrary quota, frankly, that the White House care of Stephen Miller has set forward. And we are going to continue as we get closer anddeeper and deeperinto the summer, as we go into the fall to see racial profiling. The factswerethatit's easierfor people who livedin LatinAmericaandSouth America to travel north, whichwaswhy Latinos andHispanics contribute to a major population of illegal immigrants.That fact wascompletely taken out of context forthe purpose ofwhat ICEwasfor.ICEwasnot arresting people based on their race, butratheriftheywere in the country illegally. The liberal mediahaveshown supportand sympathy towards illegal immigrants receiving thesame privilegesasAmerican citizens,andthey have forgotten that ICE wasestablishedtouphold the law andprotect thecountry. Former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki contributed to theconversation by suggesting that ICE was 'kidnapping' people. She also whined about them arresting people who lost the cases in immigration court: They are going into communities where peopledon'thave criminal records or people arelaw-abiding, even people who are going to their court hearingsandthey'retargeting people...So when they say they're going after the worst of the worst and the hardest of the hardest, what they'reactuallydoingto meet that, try to meet that 3000 number thatStephen Miller and others have set is they're going after what they consider low hanging fruit. People who arelaw-abiding, some who pay taxes, who are going to courtrooms to meet that number, andthey'regoing into citieslike L.A. to create a visionof chaosasif they are there to calm things, whenreallythey are the ones who are creating the chaos.Sothis is quite performative. Jen, theybrokethelaw ifthey were here illegally.Defending illegal immigrants as 'law-abiding' is hypocritical. Between 'racial profiling,''kidnapping,'and not getting the concept of the word illegal, the liberal mediapushedthe agenda that ICEwasthevillainfor keeping America safe and upholding thelaw. Meanwhile,they promotedthosewhowere hereillegally. Click here for the transcript. MSNBC's Morning Joe 7/10/25 9:24 a.m. Eastern JONATHAN LEMIRE: And Jen Psaki, a Trump official yesterday telling me that because the border is basically been closed, you know, that the heat, this this official suggests they're victim of their own success. Therefore it's not easy to find these deportations. You know, that's because they have to therefore go into the cities to make their numbers. And that's what I think is being telegraphed here is those, as Julia mentioned, those high profile clashes in Los Angeles, those ICE agents there leading to protests. President Trump has all but telegraphed that this summer we should expect a lot more of that in cities, particularly Democratic controlled cities across the country. JEN PSAKI: Well, I also think it's quite performative, Jonathan. I mean, they are - they have National Guard troops they shouldn't be using in this way. They are going into communities where people don't have criminal records or people are law abiding, even people who are going to their court hearings and they're targeting people. A lot of the reporting I've seen lately has been about 50 percent. I don't know what the exact latest numbers, but about 50 percent of the people who they are arresting, some of them kidnaping, some of them deporting are not, don't have any record at all. So when they say they're going after the worst of the worst and the hardest of the hardest, what they're actually doing to meet that - try to meet that 3,000 number that Stephen Miller and others have set, is they're going after what they consider low hanging fruit. People who are law abiding, some who pay taxes, who are going to courtrooms to meet that number. And they're going into cities like L.A. to create a vision of chaos as if they are there to calm things, when really they are the ones who are creating the chaos. So this is quite performative. It's also about trying to hit these numbers and not going after people who are doing anything in society aside from being law abiding. SYMONE SANDERS-TOWNSEND: Yeah, this is about - to be very clear. It's about race. It's not necessarily about risk because we have seen ICE go into disproportionately communities of color, disproportionately Latino and Hispanic. And I would also argue - I would also note black and brown -black communities and go to courthouses. We've seen them target traffic stops. We have seen viral videos of ICE approaching people in their yards. This is about, at this point, meeting a particular arbitrary quota, frankly, that the White House care of Stephen Miller has set forward. And we are going to continue as we get closer and deeper and deeper into the summer, as we go into the fall to see racial profiling. And we're going to see these stories come out more and more. And I have to wonder what local municipalities, but also Congress and just law abiding citizens think about this? Are we a country where we are comfortable, where we are going to racially profile people who are here based on the color of their skin, because Stephen Miller and the President wanted me to quota? That's the question we have to ask ourselves.

But I just watched a hillbilly back his pickup into a field and shoot probably $5,000 worth of fireworks into the sky Friday night. It occurred to me someone must have money, and a lot more than we had growing up. I am honestly astonished how much I can offer my kids…and they still bitch that it's not enough.

Tell me more: The exhibit, “Journey Through the Maze: 45 Years of PAC-MAN,"" is a collaboration between the city and PAC-MAN creator Bandai Namco Entertainment, whose U.S. headquarters are in Irvine. You'll find memorabilia, early game sketch designs — and three old-school arcade games where you can brush up on your ghost-gobbling skills. Why now: Bandai Namco is using the occasion of PAC-MAN's 45th anniversary to drop a new PAC-MAN game, called Shadow Labyrinth, on July 18. Read on ... for more about the exhibit and some special events planned for the summer. My eyes frequently glaze over when my 10-year-old son bursts into my room to tell me about the latest Fortnite update, or a new video game he just has to have. This is probably unfair since I also think fondly back to my old summer days spent flopped on the carpet playing Pong, and nights at the local Pizza Hut popping quarter after quarter into the PAC-MAN machine to defeat those pesky (and adorable) little ghosts.

The PAC-MAN exhibit at Irvine's Great Park Gallery is designed to appeal to middle-aged me and my son. The exhibit, “Journey Through the Maze: 45 Years of PAC-MAN,"" is a collaboration between the city and PAC-MAN creator Bandai Namco Entertainment. The company's U.S. headquarters are in Irvine — one of the city's greater claims to fame, IMO. My son and I went to check it out this week. What's at the exhibit? The first thing you should do at the exhibit is make a beeline to one of the three old-school arcade games, where you can brush up on your ghost-gobbling skills before checking out the rest. Displays outline the history of the game and the evolution of the PAC-MAN franchise. Another wall is dedicated to reproductions of original sketch designs of the game. Adam Sabolick, who coordinates Irvine's arts programming, told me these are among the items at the exhibit he finds most inspiring. “It shows how these really simple drawings and concepts spawned into 45 years of cultural influence,” Sabolick said. There's lots of PAC-MAN memorabilia on display, including PAC-MAN cereal boxes and a manual game — unfortunately you can't play that one. And a lot of PAC-MAN themed art. That was Susie Chadwick's favorite part. “There's so many different perspectives on it,” she said. Her son Arthur, 9, and friend Gibson, 10, were less impressed. They spent the visit improving their PAC-MAN scores. What's next for PAC-MAN Bandai Namco is using the occasion of PAC-MAN's 45th anniversary to drop a new PAC-MAN game, called Shadow Labyrinth, on July 18. In it, a warrior is accompanied by a familiar-looking yellow orb named Puck — a nod to PAC-MAN's original Japanese name — as they battle and chomp their way through a dark universe. It looks, appropriately, much more sophisticated than the old-school PAC-MAN games. I'm not sure my gaming skills are up-to-date enough to try this new version, but I bet my son will be all over it.

n2jgsw9,"  Author of ""Danmachi: Fated Hero or Foolish Demise?"" here. I'm sure most of you are aware by now, but Chapter 9 RW is out!! That's right, I've finished all the rewrites!!! I'm taking a little pause before I start working on Chapter 10 to enjoy some of my Summer, watch some of the shows I've had on my backlog for a while (Frieren), and so as not to burn myself out. That said, my break definitely won't be long as I'm far too excited for you guys to see where I'm taking the story. I don't want to give a guess as to when Chapter 10 will be out because I suck a keeping deadlines, so I'll just keep you all updated on here whenever these fanfic fridays pop up. On a side note, I've thought long and hard on how to do the backstories for several characters in a way that does them justice, and I think I've landed on what I'm going to do. Whenever I hit the end of arc 3 in my story (chapter 50ish), the next chapters will be just a general synopsis on the backstories of some characters, but the full stories will be in a separate fanfic. That way, Bell can still remain the main focus of the story without having the story derail into a 50-chapter (I'm just throwing out a random number) flashback. More information on that separate fanfic will come way, way later (you can probably tell who the characters will be and what it will be about if you look at my most recent post(s)). Fanfic information: * Excluding the prologue, it follows the events of a hypothetical MS18. Because it's hypothetical, you won't be spoiled by the actual MS18 (say, for a few things). * The main ship is BellxAis. * There is an OC, but Bell is still the main character. * Spoilers up to MS17 and SO12. * I also try to be as loyal as I can to the material, but some alterations should be expected (this is still a fanfic after all) Fanfic Link (The top is Wattpad, and the bottom is fanfic.net) * [https://www.wattpad.com/story/332032079-danmachi-fated-hero-or-foolish-demise](https://www.wattpad.com/story/332032079-danmachi-fated-hero-or-foolish-demise) * [Danmachi: Fated Hero or Foolish Demise?

mov_86565E2791C7C1B743FA72BE8588BDDA,"  has released its summer presenter line-up as regular hosts Cat Deeley and Ben Shephard prepare to take a break until September. Stars of traditionally take the summer off, with guest hosts drafted in to cover for them. A rotating cast of well-known faces are set for the This Morning sofa, including one brand new star who's making her presenting debut. Who are This Morning's summer presenters? As usual, This Morning's main hosts are set to take a summer holiday, which means a cast of guest presenters will be on the sofa in the coming weeks. Now, ITV has unveiled who will be standing in for Deeley and Shephard in an Instagram post showing polaroid photos of the relief presenters. It read: ""This summer, get ready for the best staycation ever! Holiday from home as some of our favourite faces come together to entertain you. From sofa to sun lounger, brighten up your mornings with our all-star lineup, this summer on This Morning."" Polaroids included regular Friday hosts Alison Hammond and Dermot O'Leary, who will still be in over the summer. As previously announced, former Love Islander Olivia Attwood will get her first run as host after serving as a Loose Women panellist. The rest of the summer line-up will be familiar to This Morning viewers - it includes competitions host and relief presenter Andi Peters, regular guest hosts Josie Gibson, Craig Doyle and Rochelle Humes, and entertainment reporter Sian Welby. Emma Willis, Joel Dommett and Rylan, who took turns presenting before Deeley and Shephard joined the show full time, will also be in over the summer. When will Cat Deeley and Ben Shephard be back on TV? Since Deeley and Shephard were announced as the new This Morning hosts in 2024, they have become a hit with viewers. Just like their predecessors Holly Willoughby and Phillip Schofield, they usually take breaks from the show over the school holidays and this summer will be no different. Deeley and Shephard are expected to finish for summer on Thursday, 17 July - they don't work on Fridays anyway - and although a specific return date has not been announced, they should be back on air in September. Are other ITV daytime stars taking a summer break? Deeley and Shephard aren't the only ones looking forward to a long summer break - Lorraine Kelly will be taking holiday over the coming weeks, too.

mov_329BE0DA3942D9FEBAADDF9198CD72A4,"  If ever there was a synagogue that's earned the right to throw itself a birthday shindig, it's this elegant and intriguing house of worship in central Norway only 220 miles south of the Arctic Circle. Over the past century, the Trondheim Synagogue has weathered isolation from the rest of the Jewish world; the Holocaust, which wiped out half its community; challenges related to Shabbat observance because of its far northern latitude, and persistent antisemitism that has only grown worse since the war in Gaza began in 2023. This fall, the synagogue will be observing its 100-year anniversary with a three-day celebration, culminating with an Oct. 26 event which members of Norway's royal family, the country's prime minister, the mayor of Trondheim and other dignitaries are scheduled to attend. “There will be speeches, songs and, of course, we will tell the history of the community,” says John Arne Moen, president of the Trondheim Jewish Community. “We are on the outskirts of the Jewish world, living close to the polar circle. You will probably not find a community like ours any other place in the world.” With a population of about 200,000, Trondheim is Norway's third-largest city, behind Oslo and Bergen. Located on the shores of a fjord that's an inlet in the Norwegian Sea, the city was founded in the year 997 and was Norway's capital during the Viking Age. The city's most famous site is the Nidaros Cathedral, completed in 1300 at the burial place of King Olav II, who is credited with bringing Christianity to Norway. The unlikely story of Jewish life in Trondheim began in the late 19th century, when Jewish immigrants began arriving from Poland and Lithuania, usually because they couldn't afford to go to America. Many worked as traveling merchants. By 1900, there were more than 100 Jews living in Trondheim and the city's first synagogue was established. During the next 20 years, the community grew to more than 300 members, prompting the need for a larger synagogue. In 1923 an old railway station at Arkitekt Christies Gate 1 was purchased with the financial support of approximately 200 Jews from Oslo and converted into a synagogue. It was inaugurated in 1925 and remains — along with the synagogue in Oslo — one of only two synagogues in the country. The building, designed in the Neoclassical style, is fronted by a light-blue façade with arched windows and white molding. Inside, the two-story sanctuary also features a blue motif. Originally, women were seated in the balcony during services. Now, the balcony is no longer used; men and women sit together on the main floor. Germany occupied Norway from 1940 to 1945. The Nazis confiscated the synagogue and used it as a barracks, replacing the Stars of David in the windows with swastikas. It's believed that 165 local Jews — about half of Trondheim's Jewish population at the time — died in the Holocaust, fueled by robust collaboration by local authorities. Most of the victims were deported by train to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, where only a few survived. Early efforts to memorialize the murdered Jews of Trondheim were undertaken by the remnants of the community that survived. But in the mid-1990s, the city embarked on its own memorial enterprise, choosing Cissi Klein — who was 13 when she was seized from her school, deported to Auschwitz and killed upon arrival — to become a symbol of Trondheim's Nazi victims. A statue of Cissi stands in a quiet park a short walk from the Trondheim Synagogue. Built in 1997 as part of the city's millennium commemorations, the memorial is located outside the apartment building where Cissi lived with her parents and brother. A street alongside the park has been named in her honor. Today, Moen estimates there are 200 Jews living in Trondheim; about three-quarters are members of the synagogue. Shabbat services are typically held every other Friday. The chief rabbi of Norway, Michael Melchior, lives in Israel but periodically travels to Oslo and Trondheim to conduct services. (Melchior's father was the longtime chief rabbi of Denmark.) When Melchior isn't in town, services are usually led by Israeli-born Asher Serussi, a religious leader in the community who has lived in Trondheim for 30 years. Serussi describes the Trondheim Synagogue as “Orthodox but very flexible and modern.” “Most of the people here are not observant Jews,” he said. “Our members are interested in the Jewish culture and traditions. But they don't keep kosher and they don't keep Shabbat. They enjoy very much when we have celebrations for holidays. Then it's a full house here.” For the more religious who follow halacha, or traditional Jewish law, the question about how to handle the starting and ending times of Shabbat has been a topic of debate ever since the congregation was founded in 1905. According to halacha, Shabbat begins a few minutes before sunset and lasts for 25 hours. But Trondheim is located so far north that the amount of daylight can vary between 20 hours in the summer and just four hours in the winter. So what's an Orthodox congregation to do in a country known as “the land of the midnight sun”? Other communities in far northern latitudes handle the issue in a variety of ways. Some set the Shabbat clock based on Jerusalem time, while others divide the day equally into two 12-hour segments. Some start Shabbat at the traditional moment, even if that means lighting candles around midnight. Moen says the congregation developed its own approach in its early years of existence that seemed to be palatable to its members and blessed by most of the Orthodox rabbis who have examined the question. For the Trondheim Synagogue, Shabbat begins at 5:30 p.m. on Fridays and ends at 6:30 p.m. on Saturdays, regardless of the time of year and whether or not there's sunlight or polar darkness. “It's been our rule for 120 years,” says Moen. “We have grown up with it....","If ever there was a synagogue that's earned the right to throw itself a birthday shindig, it's this elegant and intriguing house of worship in central Norway only 220 miles south of the Arctic Circle.

Voices include those who worked on the film - such as composer John Williams, production designer Joe Alves and actors Jonathan Filley and Lorriane Gary - as well as filmmaker luminaries from James Cameron and Jordan Peele to George Lucas. Alex Ross Perry's experimental documentary about the '90s indie band Pavement (""Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain"") is streaming on Mubi. There are actors (""Stranger Things' "" Joe Keery, Nat Wolff, Jason Schwartzman), the real guys (Stephen Malkmus), archival footage and irreverent stagings that help evoke the spirit of the band, and kind of tell its story, as unconventionally as possible. Writer-director Mark Anthony Green's debut movie ""Opus,"" a cult-​horror about a reclusive pop star and a mysterious retreat, did not receive the best reviews out of the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. But it touts the kind of cast and intriguing premise that makes it a hard-to-resist curiosity, with Ayo Edebiri and John Malkovich leading, that is now streaming on HBO Max. In his review for The Associated Press, Mark Kennedy wrote, ""How both could be totally miscast will haunt your dreams.""

Clipse, the dynamic duo of Pusha T and Malice, have returned for ""Let God Sort Em Out"" out now, their first new project as a duo in over 15 years. The two are as keen as ever; there has been no dull to either's flow in that time. And if that's not a strong enough co-sign, a quick look at the album's features will confirm its greatness: Kendrick Lamar, Tyler the Creator, Nas, Pharrell Williams, John Legend, the-Dream, Ab-Liva and Stove God Cooks. Nigerian superstar Burna Boy, a leading voice in Afrobeats, has released his eighth studio album, ""No Sign of Weakness,"" out now. It's a high-energy good time, as first made apparent in the percussion-heavy ""TaTaTa"" featuring rapper Travis Scott. It was one of the bestselling albums of all time. Backstreet Boys' 1999 boy band classic, ""Millennium,"" gets a facelift with the release of ""Millennium 2.0,"" out now. It's a deluxe reissue, now with a brand-new song, B-sides and live recordings. And that makes you larger than life. - Maria Sherman, Associated Press Television ABC's ""Bachelor in Paradise"" marks its 10th season this summer with a golden twist. Contestants from ""The Golden Bachelor"" and ""The Golden Bachelorette"" are sent to a resort in Costa Rica to have fun in the sun and possibly make romantic connections. There's also a number of younger ""Bachelor"" and ""Bachelorette"" cast members who randomly get added to the mix.

Dexter Morgan takes Manhattan in ""Dexter: Resurrection,"" a sequel to 2021's ""Dexter: New Blood."" Michael C. Hall reprises his role as the serial killer who hunts other serial killers.

Stream it on Peacock....","Movies Steven Spielberg reflects on the ""life altering experience"" that was ""Jaws,"" which celebrates its 50th anniversary this summer, in the new documentary ""Jaws @ 50: The Definitive Inside Story,"" now streaming on Disney+ and Hulu. Voices include those who worked on the film - such as composer John Williams, production designer Joe Alves and actors Jonathan Filley and Lorriane Gary - as well as filmmaker luminaries from James Cameron and Jordan Peele to George Lucas. Alex Ross Perry's experimental documentary about the '90s indie band Pavement (""Crooked Rain, Crooked Rain"") is streaming on Mubi. There are actors (""Stranger Things' "" Joe Keery, Nat Wolff, Jason Schwartzman), the real guys (Stephen Malkmus), archival footage and irreverent stagings that help evoke the spirit of the band, and kind of tell its story, as unconventionally as possible. Writer-director Mark Anthony Green's debut movie ""Opus,"" a cult-​horror about a reclusive pop star and a mysterious retreat, did not receive the best reviews out of the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. But it touts the kind of cast and intriguing premise that makes it a hard-to-resist curiosity, with Ayo Edebiri and John Malkovich leading, that is now streaming on HBO Max. In his review for Associated Press, Mark Kennedy wrote, ""How both could be totally miscast will haunt your dreams."" Kennedy added, ""Green wobbles as he tries to land this plane and what had been an intriguing premise to talk about fame and the parasitic industries that live off it turns into a gross-out, run-for-it bloodfest and a plot that unravels."" Lindsey Bahr, Associated Press Music The rap record of the summer is here. Clipse, the dynamic duo of Pusha T and Malice, have returned for ""Let God Sort Em Out"" out now, their first new project as a duo in over 15 years. The two are as keen as ever; there has been no dull to either's flow in that time. And if that's not a strong enough co-sign, a quick look at the album's features will confirm its greatness: Kendrick Lamar, Tyler the Creator, Nas, Pharrell Williams, John Legend, the-Dream, Ab-Liva and Stove God Cooks. Nigerian superstar Burna Boy, a leading voice in Afrobeats, has released his eighth studio album, ""No Sign of Weakness,"" out now. It's a high-energy good time, as first made apparent in the percussion-heavy ""TaTaTa"" featuring rapper Travis Scott. It was one of the bestselling albums of all time. Backstreet Boys' 1999 boy band classic, ""Millennium,"" gets a facelift with the release of ""Millennium 2.0,"" out now. It's a deluxe reissue, now with a brand-new song, B-sides and live recordings. And that makes you larger than life. Maria Sherman, Associated Press Television ABC's ""Bachelor in Paradise"" marks its 10th season this summer with a golden twist. Contestants from ""The Golden Bachelor"" and ""The Golden Bachelorette"" are sent to a resort in Costa Rica to have fun in the sun and possibly make romantic connections. There's also a number of younger ""Bachelor"" and ""Bachelorette"" cast members who randomly get added to the mix. Jesse Palmer hosts with Bachelor Nation favorites Wells Adams serving as in-house bartender and Hannah Brown, who is in charge of Paradise Relations, whatever that means. New episodes air Mondays and also stream on Hulu. Peyton Manning's Netflix docuseries ""Quarterback"" returns for a second season. Cameras follow NFL Quarterbacks Joe Burrow of the Cleveland Browns, Jared Goff of the Detroit Lions and Kirk Cousins. Cousins was also featured in Season 1 as the QB for the Minnesota Vikings but in Season 2 we see him injured from a torn Achilles. He eventually parts ways with the Vikings (who drafted Michigan's J.J. McCarthy) and signs with the Atlanta Falcons. All eight episodes are now streaming. There's a ""Bosch"" spinoff on Amazon Prime Video focusing on LAPD homicide detective Renée Ballard (who you may recognize from the ""Bosch: Legacy"" series finale.) ""Ballard,"" starring Maggie Q as the titular character, is also based on books by Michael Connelly and is now available to stream. Chip and Joanna Gaines' Magnolia Network presents ""a social experiment"" where three families live ""Little House on the Prairie""-​style for eight weeks. New episodes of ""Back to the Frontier"" are released Thursdays on Max. Meg Stalter of ""Hacks"" stars in a new Netflix comedy from Lena Dunham called ""Too Much.""

A significant aspect of the approval was its long-term vacancy and previous non-retail usage, which supported the green light for the new plans. Despite not fully complying with retail policy, economic and regeneration benefits were noted. Due to its self-contained nature and location in a mixed-use central zone, minimal impact on residential amenity is expected. While no external changes are proposed, signage will need separate consent. The site, although in a sensitive archaeological area, raised no objections from Heneb, known as The Trust for Welsh Archaeology, due to the scale of the proposed works. Natural Resources Wales also had no objections, despite the site falling within flood zones 2 and 3, but recommended awareness and resilience measures. Given its city centre location, no operational parking is required, and there were no objections from Highways. The arcade is expected to produce minimal waste, and it will have to adhere to a submitted waste plan. Although no biodiversity enhancements were proposed, a condition requires the submission and implementation of a biodiversity enhancement scheme. The application, led by M.

But there has been something especially poignant in the stories of the campers, counselors, and staff from Camp Mystic who died last week in the Guadalupe River's floodwaters. We think of the years that should have been ahead of them, filled with laughter, learning, friends, new adventures, fun, frustration, love and heartbreak and love again. Hanna and Rebecca Lawrence were twin sisters who had just finished second grade.

But there has been something especially poignant in the stories of the campers, counselors, and staff from Camp Mystic who died last week in the Guadalupe River's floodwaters. We think of the years that should have been ahead of them, filled with laughter, learning, friends, new adventures, fun, frustration, love and heartbreak and love again. Hanna and Rebecca Lawrence were twin sisters who had just finished second grade. Their parents said in a statement, ""We are devastated that the bond we shared with them, and that they shared with each other, is now frozen in time.""

mov_16044B634092DAF357B242F58A208EB7,"  Everybody begrudgingly say, ""thank you, TikTok,"" for this magical $5 foot-peeling spray and game-changing nausea relief inhaler. 1. A ""spray and go"" enzyme-based laundry stain remover that works its magic in one wash to help you instantly get rid of all that discolored dried sweat, oil stains, or deodorant residue on your favorite clothes, so you don't have to do any heavy scrubbing yourself. Check out a TikTok of the laundry spray in action. Puracy is a Texas-based, family-owned business specializing in plant-based, chemical-free, hypoallergenic home products, with a donation made to local families in need with a portion of every purchase. Psst — this spray also does a number on all those other miscellaneous stains in your life, like wine, coffee, soy sauce, makeup, and period blood! I recently bought this to test it for myself, and can attest to how well it works to get period blood out even after you've tried something else. I stained a pair of beloved bright-blue bike shorts in my sleep and tried to get it out with soap and water, but the stain was still there when it came out of the wash. I treated it with this, stuck it back in the wash, and BOOM, it's like it never happened (I panicked before I could get a before and after, please forgive me, laundry gods). Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in different sizes). 2. A delightfully affordable instant foot peeling spray for anyone ready to go full YEEHAW!! on a pedicure, without the big salon price tag. This not only helps gently remove dead skin, but moisturizes dry and cracked heels, so you'll really get some refreshing bang for your buck. Promising review: ""This product delivers exactly as promised and is incredibly easy to use. I suffer from dry skin and often apply various products to soften my feet. With this, I simply spray it on and immediately massage it in with my hands. The dead skin comes off effortlessly. There's no waiting time, and it's gentle on the skin. It leaves my feet feeling exceptionally soft. This has quickly become my new favorite thing."" —KimT Promising review: ""Wow, does this work amazingly!

Bounce Curl is a small business that specializes in curl brushes. Check out a TikTok of the Edgelift Curl Brush in action.

mov_F309F046BC65841D237EEE9A124AB48E,"  By Beth Wood Published: July 12, 2025, 6:05am Share One of the city of Vancouver's annual summer events is Friday Night Movies in the Park. On the first four Fridays in August, the city will host a different family movie, each in a different park. This year's movies are: “Coco,” “Moana 2,” “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” and “Barbie.” Refreshments are usually available for purchase, and the movies start around dark. It's a fun way to spend an evening outside in the summertime. The Kiggins Theatre is also hosting its annual “Grease” singalong today and Sunday. If you can't make it to the parks or theater, you can always check out DVDs from the library and have a movie night at home. Personally, I love musicals — you just can't beat the uplift you get from a great song-and-dance number. The library has many old favorites available to rent, like “The Sound of Music” and “West Side Story” (old and new versions), as well as some older titles and lesser-known musicals that you may not have seen: From Rodgers & Hammerstein: “Cinderella,” “Carousel,” “South Pacific” and “The King & I.” “Into the Woods” by Stephen Sondheim. Silver Screen Icons series: Broadway Musicals and Astaire & Rogers, Vol. 1 & 2 — each of these collections contains four musicals. “Jailhouse Rock” and “Viva Las Vegas” starring Elvis Presley. “Pitch Perfect 1-3” and “High School Musical 1-3.” And of course, Disney movies! Musicals not your thing? Pick a genre, and have a film festival — monster movies, or Hallmark romances both hold many options. Get the kids to dress up and have a '60s night or an '80s night. We also have lots of TV series to binge watch. Monster movies: “The Blob,” “Godzilla,” “Nosferatu: Symphony of Horror” and “Alien.” Movies from the 1960s: “Psycho,” “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “My Fair Lady” and “Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid.” Movies from the 1980s: “Valley Girl,” “The Breakfast Club,” “The NeverEnding Story” and “Back to the Future.” BBC TV shows to binge: “Doctor Who,” “The Office” and “All Creatures Great and Small.” Cartoons you watched as a kid: “Mr. Peabody & Sherman,” “Scooby-Doo! ,” “Hey Arnold” and “SpongeBob SquarePants.” If you're a true movie geek, ask your audience questions after the film. Which was your favorite “Breakfast Club” character and why? Was “The Blob” alive and how do you know? If you had a Tardis from “Doctor Who,” where and when would you travel? Which song from which musical best describes you?","By Beth Wood Published: July 12, 2025, 6:05am Share One of the city of Vancouver's annual summer events is Friday Night Movies in the Park.

The online retailing powerhouse – and tech giant – said Prime Day 2025, which ran from July 8-11, was its biggest ever, the company announced Saturday, July 12, in a news release. Amazon's 11th Prime Day drove record sales and a record number of items sold, larger than any previous four-day period that included a Prime Day event, the company said. (The promotion became a two-day affair in 2019; this year, Amazon expanded it to four days for the first time.) U.S. online spending during Prime Day's four days amounted to an estimated $24.1 billion, according to Adobe. Its Adobe Analytics sales data tracks online transactions across U.S. retail sites. The data, which is aggregated and anonymized, doesn't directly track Amazon's sales but does reflect overall spending and suggest Prime Day demand. How did Amazon Prime Day 2025 compare to Black Friday 2024? Spending for Prime Day amounted to ""more than two Black Fridays – which drove $10.8 billion in online spending during the 2024 holiday shopping season – and sets a new benchmark for the summer shopping season,"" Adobe said in a news release. The total also surpassed Adobe's pre-Prime Day estimate of $23.8 billion in sales. Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

(The promotion became a two-day affair in 2019; this year, Amazon expanded it to four days for the first time.) U.S. online spending during Prime Day's four days amounted to an estimated $24.1 billion, according to Adobe. Its Adobe Analytics sales data tracks online transactions across U.S. retail sites.

How did Amazon Prime Day 2025 compare to Black Friday 2024? Spending for Prime Day amounted to ""more than two Black Fridays – which drove $10.8 billion in online spending during the 2024 holiday shopping season – and sets a new benchmark for the summer shopping season,"" Adobe said in a news release. The total also surpassed Adobe's pre-Prime Day estimate of $23.8 billion in sales. ""This year's extended Prime Day event delivered incredible savings to our members across millions of deals,"" said Doug Herrington, CEO of Amazon Worldwide Stores, in a news release. ""We're thrilled to see record savings for our customers, who found great prices on the everyday essentials and products they love."" Herrington also saluted Amazon's employees, saying, ""Their efforts made this our biggest Prime Day yet, and I'm grateful for their contributions."" Independent sellers, including small and medium-sized businesses, also racked up record sales and a record number of items sold, according to Amazon. ""We saw impressive sales not just on our Prime exclusive deals but across our entire catalog,"" said Anne Maza, co-owner of the small business Olivia Garden, in a statement. ""Beyond the immediate revenue boost, we're especially thrilled about the increased brand awareness and the acquisition of new customers through the event.” A majority of shoppers (53.2%) made purchases on mobile devices, compared to on desktop computers, accounting for $12.8 billion of the spending, according to Adobe.

The online retailing powerhouse – and tech giant – said Prime Day 2025, which ran from July 8-11, was its biggest ever, the company announced Saturday, July 12, in a news release. Amazon's 11th Prime Day drove record sales and a record number of items sold, larger than any previous four-day period that included a Prime Day event, the company said. (The promotion became a two-day affair in 2019; this year, Amazon expanded it to four days for the first time.) U.S. online spending during Prime Day's four days amounted to an estimated $24.1 billion, according to Adobe. Its Adobe Analytics sales data tracks online transactions across U.S. retail sites. The data, which is aggregated and anonymized, doesn't directly track Amazon's sales but does reflect overall spending and suggest Prime Day demand. How did Amazon Prime Day 2025 compare to Black Friday 2024? Spending for Prime Day amounted to ""more than two Black Fridays – which drove $10.8 billion in online spending during the 2024 holiday shopping season – and sets a new benchmark for the summer shopping season,"" Adobe said in a news release. The total also surpassed . Need a break? ""This year's extended Prime Day event delivered incredible savings to our members across millions of deals,"" said Doug Herrington, CEO of Amazon Worldwide Stores, in a news release. ""We're thrilled to see record savings for our customers, who found great prices on the everyday essentials and products they love."" Shopping: Herrington also saluted Amazon's employees, saying, ""Their efforts made this our biggest Prime Day yet, and I'm grateful for their contributions."" Independent sellers, including small and medium-sized businesses, also racked up record sales and a record number of items sold, according to Amazon. ""We saw impressive sales not just on our Prime exclusive deals but across our entire catalog,"" said Anne Maza, co-owner of the small business Olivia Garden, in a statement.

Jules Lieveld can't walk twenty meters or he meets someone. Between the dozens of eating stalls with flutter (the stomach of a cow in spicy broth), meat sausage and shavings sounds music everywhere. “Cozy, cozy, cozy!” The MC at Tent Waterkant calls through the speaker that is at a maximum volume.

mov_44E1ABAE892F0349F8A1A25A99E90F5B,"  Dexter: Resurrection will see the return of a fan-favorite Miami Metro character from the original series. Dexter: Resurrection is one of the biggest shows of the summer as it continues the story of a beloved fictional serial killer played by Michael C. Hall. Weeks after being shot by his own son, Dexter emerges from a coma and heads to New York City to try to make things right with his kid. Unfortunately, he is being haunted by his past as Angel Batista returns to investigate Dexter under suspicion of being the Bay Harbor Butcher. It's hardly an unfamiliar plot line, but it's one that is made more dramatic given the two decades of history and current circumstances. The first episode of Dexter: Resurrection was jam-packed with cameos of characters from Dexter's past. Not only is he reconnected with the ghost of his father who will be by his side the whole season, but he also has some heart to hearts with the Trinity Killer, Miguel Prado, and James Doakes. It is expected that other Dexter characters will pop up later in the show, but there have still been some question marks with regards to a few key characters from Dexter's past. Earlier this year, Dexter actor Desmond Harrington was asked whether he was going to return as Joey Quinn in Dexter: Resurrection . He got very cagey and wouldn't confirm nor deny anything. People took this as a not-so-subtle hint that Harrington would return. The first two episodes of the show have aired and he hasn't popped up yet, calling into question when and if he will appear. Dexter: Resurrection Will Bring Back Joey Quinn , Confirms Desmond Harrington  dexter However, a new teaser for the rest of the season was released and eagle-eyed fans think they spotted Quinn. In a blink and you'll miss it shot, we see a Miami Metro police car with a detective standing over a body in the background. The detective is out of focus, but his body and stance look just like Quinn. Desmond Harrington took to Instagram to confirm it, posting the image and saying he couldn't say anything more. He thanked the creative team for bringing him back, confirming he is in Dexter: Resurrection . It's unclear just how large his role will be, but this is sure to excite fans. Quinn is one of the best characters from the original show and has a very interesting history with Dexter. Not only did Quinn hire someone to investigate Dexter, but he also dated Deb. He was in love with her up until she died and was willing to turn a blind eye to Dexter blatantly murdering her killer for revenge. Some have questioned over the years whether Quinn really knows the truth about Dexter . Either way, if Quinn is getting involved, he will likely find out that Dexter is alive and that may drum up some drama. If he finds out the truth, he could become motivated to take Dexter down as a way of avenging Deb. There's a lot of potential for something really intense here, but we'll just have to wait and see how it all unravels. Dexter: Resurrection has plans for at least three seasons , so even if Quinn doesn't become a main player this season, he could in the future. The show is already a massive hit with fans and critics alike. It has one of the highest ratings on Rotten Tomatoes of the entire Dexter franchise, holding a strong 90%. We gave Dexter: Resurrection a 4 out of 5 in our review , praising it for its thrilling drama, blending the old with the new, and offering a brilliant character study for Dexter Morgan.

Gold Bond's firming neck and chest cream your skin will be SO happy to soak up — this is formulated with aloe, salicylic acid, and jojoba oil to help hydrate, tighten, and gently exfoliate your skin so effectively that you should be able to see early results in two weeks. Reviewers especially love how affordable this is compared to creams that often cost three times this $12 price tag (or more)! Promising review: ""I am a lotion user every single day. I use face moisturizers that I love. I am over the moon about how good this is. I mainly use it on my neck, hands, and forearms. The difference is amazing. My skin actually feels so good.

I have been struggling to find a product that de-frizzes my hair without making it look oiled down, and this is it. I put it in my wet hair after washing, towel dried, and put my hair in a ponytail to go to work. My hair was frizz-free all night — even working outside in high humidity. People even asked if I did something to my hair! This is an amazing product for the price.

Promising review: ""My new must-have! My number one go-to for healing lips was Carmex. This beat it. I love the consistency (very creamy/smooth), it's not heavily flavored or goopy, and it obviously smells amazing. It isn't overbearing and also doesn't keep coating your mouth like the Eos stick balms (still great, but more wax)."" —Breanah Shirazi Get it from Amazon for $5.89 (also available in Strawberry Acai). 4.

Promising review: ""Took this on my first cruise. Anytime that I started to feel woozy I'd reach for it.

I wish I could but larger containers of it."" —Kimberly P. Get it from Amazon for $11.19. 2. Lottabody's Coconut Oil Foaming Curl Mousse designed for all hair types to give you satisfyingly hydrated, volumized, frizz-free curls at a FRACTION of the price of its competitors. Promising review: ""I have super frizzy, curly hair and live in New England, where we have super humid summers. I have been struggling to find a product that de-frizzes my hair without making it look oiled down, and this is it. I put it in my wet hair after washing, towel dried, and put my hair in a ponytail to go to work. My hair was frizz-free all night — even working outside in high humidity. People even asked if I did something to my hair! This is an amazing product for the price.

A teensy two-in-one nausea relief inhaler designed to work FAST on spontaneous nausea, motion sickness, morning sickness, and general queasiness (having a human body is hard).

Promising review: ""Took this on my first cruise. Anytime that I started to feel woozy I'd reach for it. I'm sure the required act of deep breathing helped a lot — and breathing in the fragrance of the essential oil is very calming and effective. Worked for me! Wonderful!"" —Willy&Lilly Get a pack of two from Amazon for $12.99 (also available in a pack of four). 5.
