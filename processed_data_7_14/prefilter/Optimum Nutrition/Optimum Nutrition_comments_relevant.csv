Its a good thing some brands are giving 500rs samples nowadays on blinkit due to competition so we can try before purchasing in bulk.

Is it our natural defense mechanism to avoid fatal issues caused by too much protein? 4- The taste of unflavoured muscle blaze whey protein concentrate is sour and bitter, also the taste of optimum nutrition double rich chocolate whey protein is very less chocolate/sweet type compared to mb double rich one, I have to try very hard to stop feeling of gag reflex/gastric uneasiness upon drinking of bad taste whey protein with water (i dont like adding it to milk, banana,etc, i like my protein raw in water), how are people really coping with them, though they really dont care for awful taste? then why do people still buying these two boxes of whey? 6- why beginner's whey protein boxes are not popular for people beginning gym?

My questions- 1- Why India being a leading producer of milk, has whey protein priced heavily even though its derived from milk? I think govt should subsidise them, won't increased productivity help govt in the end? 2- Why does the whole truth whey protein is being more bought then muscle blaze whey, even though whole truth is unflavoured, similarly priced and quite new entry (therefore suspicious) in market? 3- Many leading brands sell digestive enzymes along with whey protein, why do we Indians lack protein digesting enzymes? Is it our natural defense mechanism to avoid fatal issues caused by too much protein? 4- The taste of unflavoured muscle blaze whey protein concentrate is sour and bitter, also the taste of optimum nutrition double rich chocolate whey protein is very less chocolate/sweet type compared to mb double rich one, I have to try very hard to stop feeling of gag reflex/gastric uneasiness upon drinking of bad taste whey protein with water (i dont like adding it to milk, banana,etc, i like my protein raw in water), how are people really coping with them, though they really dont care for awful taste? then why do people still buying these two boxes of whey? 6- why beginner's whey protein boxes are not popular for people beginning gym? Why do I feel low on energy without whey protein and even eggs and chicken dont help much until I take whey protein? 7- Why should I mix whey evenly in water, whats wrong with leaving lumps?",2025-07-05 05:24:16,en,REDDIT,,,,,1,False,True,"The comment directly mentions Optimum Nutrition's double rich chocolate whey protein and compares it with other brands like Muscle Blaze, providing detailed personal experiences and opinions about taste, protein supplements, and the gym supplement market.

Clearly, as well as being an impressive England captain, Leah Williamson, 28, has a catwalk-worthy fashion career too. One of the biggest earners off the pitch after leading the Lionesses to victory at the Euro 2022 final, the blonde beauty has a deal with Nike and has collaborated with global brands such as Aston Martin, Pepsi, Walkers and Mastercard. With 1.1 million Instagram followers, she has new advert partnerships with Weetabix and Cadbury, along with six children's books, titled The Wonder Team. With the deals comes the gloss: her recent lavish Mallorcan holiday to an Ikos resort would have set her back in the region of £1,000 a night. She is rumoured to be dating former model and Miss USA Elle Smith - both have posted about each other on social media. LAUREN'S OOH LA LA LEGO PROVING that every passion can be profitable, Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp, 24, has topped up her estimated £400,000 salary with a sponsorship deal with Lego. Devoted to creating Lego masterpieces in her downtime, saying it's 'the best way to relax', she's even made the Mona Lisa out of the bricks. Her other sponsors include Nike and Sports Direct.

But neither her isolated upbringing nor her neurodiversity held her back. Rather, she's said she uses the intense focus associated with her conditions to her advantage - and now the 33-year-old is one of the biggest earners in the game. She reportedly took home £200,000 a year while playing at Barcelona before her move to Chelsea in 2024. Big money deals followed her triumph at the last Euros, with Pepsi, EE, Klarna and Visa among her backers. Her former girlfriend is fellow Lioness Keira Walsh.

n2by3nf,"  Damn, sorry you had a rough experience bro — totally fair to be frustrated when stuff like that happens. For what it's worth, I've had the opposite experience so far. Been using Hyugalife for the past 5 months, mainly for protein powders (bought Optimum Nutrition and MuscleBlaze a few times), and I've had no major issues. Deliveries usually show up in 3–5 days in Mumbai, and once when I had a delay, I DMed them on Instagram and actually got a quick reply — way faster than emailing support. Also made the address mistake once 😅 — I called the courier directly (they used Delhivery in my case), and the guy helped reroute it to a pickup point nearby. Still annoying, but I think these issues happen on most platforms, tbh. HealthKart gave me a broken shaker once, and Amazon once sent me the wrong flavor — so no one's perfect. That said, I always go for COD now and avoid big orders unless it's during their sale periods (like July 12–14 coming up), 'cause that's when the deals are actually worth it. If you're ordering again, maybe try sticking to known brands + COD and see if it's smoother? Hope your refund comes through fast though — been there, it sucks.","Damn, sorry you had a rough experience bro — totally fair to be frustrated when stuff like that happens.

Shop Prime Day Sports Nutrition Deals But the best sports supplements don't come cheap. That's why, when an Amazon sale comes around, it's worth spending time taking stock of your supplies and making use of the limited-time deals from across your favourite brands. Prime Day is Amazon's biggest sale outside of Black Friday and it's now here, running from today until Friday 12 July – four whole days (or 96 hours) of savings. We've already spotted sizeable discounts on some of our top-rated sports supplements, from whey and vegan protein powders to energy drinks, pre-workouts and creatine. Prime Day Sports Nutrition Deals You can currently bag 42% off Optimum Nutrition's Gold Standard Whey, our top-rated whey protein powder, and 10% off our best on-test vegan protein powder from Form Nutrition. Keen to tap into the muscle building potential of creatine monohydrate? A large tub of Optimum Nutrition's micronised powder is now almost half price, down to £21.89, while 30 sachets of Puresport electrolytes is 15% off. Whatever you're looking to stock up on, be sure to make use of these deals while they're here. You have four days to make use of these Prime Day savings before they go back to their normal prices. Above, we've rounded up the best Prime Day sports supplement deals on products our gear editors have spotted and verified so far. When Does Prime Day End? Prime Day 2025 ends tonight, Friday 11th July, and if you're serious about fuelling your training, now's the time to stock up. The sale kicked off on Tuesday 8th July, but the clock's ticking on some of the best sports nutrition deals you'll see all year. From protein powders and creatine to hydration tablets and recovery supplements, Prime Day is packed with savings on big-name brands. Think Myprotein, Optimum Nutrition, and Grenade — all with serious discounts, but only for a few more hours. Expect even deeper cuts in these final moments, but don't hang about. Once the clock strikes midnight, it's all over and prices go back to full whack. So whether you're training for a marathon or just levelling up your gym stack, this is your last shot to save. Move fast — your gains (and your wallet) will thank you.
