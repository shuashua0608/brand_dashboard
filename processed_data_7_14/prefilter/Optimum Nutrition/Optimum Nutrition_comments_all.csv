Its a good thing some brands are giving 500rs samples nowadays on blinkit due to competition so we can try before purchasing in bulk.

I think govt should subsidise them, won't increased productivity help govt in the end? 2- Why does the whole truth whey protein is being more bought then muscle blaze whey, even though whole truth is unflavoured, similarly priced and quite new entry (therefore suspicious) in market? 3- Many leading brands sell digestive enzymes along with whey protein, why do we Indians lack protein digesting enzymes? Is it our natural defense mechanism to avoid fatal issues caused by too much protein? 4- The taste of unflavoured muscle blaze whey protein concentrate is sour and bitter, also the taste of optimum nutrition double rich chocolate whey protein is very less chocolate/sweet type compared to mb double rich one, I have to try very hard to stop feeling of gag reflex/gastric uneasiness upon drinking of bad taste whey protein with water (i dont like adding it to milk, banana,etc, i like my protein raw in water), how are people really coping with them, though they really dont care for awful taste? then why do people still buying these two boxes of whey? 6- why beginner's whey protein boxes are not popular for people beginning gym?

My questions- 1- Why India being a leading producer of milk, has whey protein priced heavily even though its derived from milk? I think govt should subsidise them, won't increased productivity help govt in the end? 2- Why does the whole truth whey protein is being more bought then muscle blaze whey, even though whole truth is unflavoured, similarly priced and quite new entry (therefore suspicious) in market? 3- Many leading brands sell digestive enzymes along with whey protein, why do we Indians lack protein digesting enzymes? Is it our natural defense mechanism to avoid fatal issues caused by too much protein? 4- The taste of unflavoured muscle blaze whey protein concentrate is sour and bitter, also the taste of optimum nutrition double rich chocolate whey protein is very less chocolate/sweet type compared to mb double rich one, I have to try very hard to stop feeling of gag reflex/gastric uneasiness upon drinking of bad taste whey protein with water (i dont like adding it to milk, banana,etc, i like my protein raw in water), how are people really coping with them, though they really dont care for awful taste? then why do people still buying these two boxes of whey? 6- why beginner's whey protein boxes are not popular for people beginning gym? Why do I feel low on energy without whey protein and even eggs and chicken dont help much until I take whey protein? 7- Why should I mix whey evenly in water, whats wrong with leaving lumps?",2025-07-05 05:24:16,en,REDDIT,,,,,1,False,True,"The comment directly mentions Optimum Nutrition's double rich chocolate whey protein and compares it with other brands like Muscle Blaze, providing detailed personal experiences and opinions about taste, protein supplements, and the gym supplement market.

Clearly, as well as being an impressive England captain, Leah Williamson, 28, has a catwalk-worthy fashion career too. One of the biggest earners off the pitch after leading the Lionesses to victory at the Euro 2022 final, the blonde beauty has a deal with Nike and has collaborated with global brands such as Aston Martin, Pepsi, Walkers and Mastercard. With 1.1 million Instagram followers, she has new advert partnerships with Weetabix and Cadbury, along with six children's books, titled The Wonder Team. With the deals comes the gloss: her recent lavish Mallorcan holiday to an Ikos resort would have set her back in the region of £1,000 a night. She is rumoured to be dating former model and Miss USA Elle Smith - both have posted about each other on social media. LAUREN'S OOH LA LA LEGO PROVING that every passion can be profitable, Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp, 24, has topped up her estimated £400,000 salary with a sponsorship deal with Lego. Devoted to creating Lego masterpieces in her downtime, saying it's 'the best way to relax', she's even made the Mona Lisa out of the bricks. Her other sponsors include Nike and Sports Direct. Lauren also has the support of her girlfriend, former Liverpool midfielder Ashley Hodson. Together for two years, the pair recently enjoyed a romantic trip to Paris, where Lauren saw the Mona Lisa in her more traditional setting. SHY SUPERSTAR WITH AN EX ON THE TEAM GROWING up, Lucy Bronze lived on Lindisfarne - also known as Holy Island - off the windswept coast of Northumberland. Her grandmother was caretaker of Lindisfarne Castle and today the outline of that building is tattooed on Lucy's wrist. Shy into adulthood, she was diagnosed with ADHD and autism in 2021. But neither her isolated upbringing nor her neurodiversity held her back. Rather, she's said she uses the intense focus associated with her conditions to her advantage - and now the 33-year-old is one of the biggest earners in the game. She reportedly took home £200,000 a year while playing at Barcelona before her move to Chelsea in 2024. Big money deals followed her triumph at the last Euros, with Pepsi, EE, Klarna and Visa among her backers. Her former girlfriend is fellow Lioness Keira Walsh. FASHION WEEK REGULAR SHE earned almost £2million in 2023 alone, according to Forbes magazine. That same year, Alessia Russo's transfer from Manchester United to Arsenal made her one of the most expensive female footballers on the planet. Her contract is said to be worth more than £500,000 a year and her commercial appeal is just as lucrative. She has deals with Gucci, Adidas, PlayStation, Beats by Dr Dre and last month was gifted an MGS5 EV car, which she proudly showed off on Instagram. A regular at London Fashion Week, Alessia, 26, has appeared on the cover of magazines such as Women's Health. The BAFTA TV Awards in May saw her in a £1,295 Roland Mouret dress, right.

She also works with Birmingham Children's Hospital after enduring numerous eye operations as a child to cure a squint. Hannah was told she would never be a professional sports player. ' I've gone through life proving people wrong,' she said recently, words that inspired devotion among her 228,000 Instagram followers. Her relationship status isn't known. DUBAI DEVOTEE SHE never travels without her Louis Vuitton luggage, can often be seen posing in a Maybach car, and enjoys swanky trips to Dubai, staying at the luxury Five resort there.

n2by3nf,"  Damn, sorry you had a rough experience bro — totally fair to be frustrated when stuff like that happens. For what it's worth, I've had the opposite experience so far. Been using Hyugalife for the past 5 months, mainly for protein powders (bought Optimum Nutrition and MuscleBlaze a few times), and I've had no major issues. Deliveries usually show up in 3–5 days in Mumbai, and once when I had a delay, I DMed them on Instagram and actually got a quick reply — way faster than emailing support. Also made the address mistake once 😅 — I called the courier directly (they used Delhivery in my case), and the guy helped reroute it to a pickup point nearby. Still annoying, but I think these issues happen on most platforms, tbh. HealthKart gave me a broken shaker once, and Amazon once sent me the wrong flavor — so no one's perfect. That said, I always go for COD now and avoid big orders unless it's during their sale periods (like July 12–14 coming up), 'cause that's when the deals are actually worth it. If you're ordering again, maybe try sticking to known brands + COD and see if it's smoother? Hope your refund comes through fast though — been there, it sucks.","Damn, sorry you had a rough experience bro — totally fair to be frustrated when stuff like that happens.

As a Prime member for 12+ years, I've spent over $25,000 on Amazon US and always experienced seamless, respectful support whenever issues came up. But my recent experience with Amazon INDIA has been deeply frustrating. I ordered an Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein 2kg (₹7,800) via Amazon.in. The package was marked “Delivered” on July 3—but never arrived. Instead, delivery person swapped protein packets with 2 packets of 1 kg salt. A case of blatant package tampering and fraud. Despite 5+ calls and escalation to a customer service “leader,” I was denied both a refund and a replacement. With Amazon US, issues were resolved in minutes, with trust placed in the customer. With Amazon India, I was treated with suspicion and made to fight for basic accountability—for a product worth less than $100. It raises some hard questions: Why is the India team so disempowered?
