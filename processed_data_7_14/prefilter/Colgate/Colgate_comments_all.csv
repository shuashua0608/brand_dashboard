n0omv3a,"  I loved Bertha at the beginning of the series. I love how she started off as the ""new money"" underdog that was mistreated by ""old money"" society, and she ended up overcoming all of it. I rooted for her during season's 1 & 2 because she was the hero of her own story. And I still think she's interesting but it's really something to see her entering this villain era. And rest assured, she is being a villain. With the way she's forcing Gladys into a marriage that she doesn't want, essentially seeing Gladys as a pawn for even more success. She showed that several times in this episode. When she found out Gladys ran off, her first concern wasn't for Gladys's safety, she wondered if she had eloped. Later when she was talking to George about everything, she put her daughter in the category of a business transaction. And, during Mrs. Fane's party when Mrs. Fish asked her, what do you call the mother of a Duchess, Bertha was beaming from ear to ear with a Colgate commercial smile. Not to mention her very obviously leaking Gladys's engagement to the Duke in the papers with noone knowing about it & threatening to disinherit Gladys if she has the nerve to choose to marry a man she loves. I think Big Bertha only uses her ""best intentions"" for her daughter as a rationalization. She sees Gladys as an extension of herself rather than her own person & a means to stay at the very head of the same society that shunned her at first.

In a reflection on the dehumanisation of immigrants in the United States (based on horrifying images emerging from prisons in El Salvador), every man will wear a T-shirt created in partnership with the American Civil Liberties Union. 25Willy Chavarria Spring/Summer 2026 Chavarria spoke to the models: “We're going to deliver a very strong message about the erasing of people,” he began. “The name of the show is Huron, which is the name of the town I grew up in, in California. And right now, as we speak, my town Huron is being attacked by ICE.” His voice broke. “People are being taken away and put in prison. What we're representing here are the Brown and Black people, taken from their families.” Four hours later, those men would be kneeling, dressed in white, in a single row, heads bowed. As an image, it resonated wide – it was also heartfelt, and brave. As is well-known, speaking up against the Trump administration can have repercussions for US citizens and visitors alike. But, in Chavarria's own words. “It's always important for me to speak about what's happening … Everything we do, whether we want it to be or not, is political.” That said, this collection was not, aesthetically, dark. Rather, it popped with saturated colour – spearmint, thick yolky yellow, a socking cobalt under the sloping, graphic brims of traditional black Cordovan hats. The hues, Chavarria said, came from the humble uniforms of warehouse and factory workers from around the world – Colgate green, Amazon blue, the scarlet of Coca-Cola co. Willy Chavarria Spring/Summer 2026Photography by Harry MillerWilly Chavarria Spring/Summer 2026Photography by Harry Miller Here, they were elevated to high fashion, executed in deluxe, Italian-milled fabrics , whether a simple cotton or a blistered metallic cloqué which, Chavarria said, was very “Carol Burnett … a bit Liz Taylor”. Indeed, there was a slant of mid-century couture to these clothes – albeit via Palm Beach, with big Deeda Blair blow-outs over to a trio of ballooning gowns in Ikea blue, yellow and a hot spanked pink, and a slithery column with a pouched coccyx in a warty puce. But the same feeling could be eked out of a polo shirt, or bomber with cocooning back. Where did the impetus for all that colour come from? “It started in a very superficial way,” Chavarria reasoned. “I want to do joy this season. I wanted to turn the tables. That was five months ago, six months ago. And as things progressed … the idea of what this joy means transformed. Now, what this joy is, is endurance. A sign of endurance, a sign of hope, a sign of rebellion.” And for me, in Chavarria's generous, joyous tailoring for men and women, there were unmistakable nods to zoot suits, the brightly-coloured, dandyish tailoring that Black and Hispanic youths wore as a form of protest through extravagance in the 1940s. They elicited violent reactions, too: in June 1943, in Chavarria's home state of California, what became known as the Zoot Suit Riots broke out, with American servicemen attacking young Latino and Mexican Americans. They stripped them of their zoot suits, ostensibly because they considered their profligate use of fabric unpatriotic against the backdrop of wartime rationing. In fact, of course, it was racially motivated violence, tinged with fear and loathing. History, it seems is repeating itself. Willy Chavarria Spring/Summer 2026Photography by Harry MillerWilly Chavarria Spring/Summer 2026Photography by Harry Miller Why did those suits excite rage? Because they refused to be silenced. They were about fighting erasure, about emphasising presence, about pride.

But, in Chavarria's own words. “It's always important for me to speak about what's happening … Everything we do, whether we want it to be or not, is political.” That said, this collection was not, aesthetically, dark. Rather, it popped with saturated colour – spearmint, thick yolky yellow, a socking cobalt under the sloping, graphic brims of traditional black Cordovan hats. The hues, Chavarria said, came from the humble uniforms of warehouse and factory workers from around the world – Colgate green, Amazon blue, the scarlet of Coca-Cola co. Willy Chavarria Spring/Summer 2026Photography by Harry MillerWilly Chavarria Spring/Summer 2026Photography by Harry Miller Here, they were elevated to high fashion, executed in deluxe, Italian-milled fabrics , whether a simple cotton or a blistered metallic cloqué which, Chavarria said, was very “Carol Burnett … a bit Liz Taylor”. Indeed, there was a slant of mid-century couture to these clothes – albeit via Palm Beach, with big Deeda Blair blow-outs over to a trio of ballooning gowns in Ikea blue, yellow and a hot spanked pink, and a slithery column with a pouched coccyx in a warty puce. But the same feeling could be eked out of a polo shirt, or bomber with cocooning back. Where did the impetus for all that colour come from? “It started in a very superficial way,” Chavarria reasoned. “I want to do joy this season. I wanted to turn the tables. That was five months ago, six months ago. And as things progressed … the idea of what this joy means transformed. Now, what this joy is, is endurance. A sign of endurance, a sign of hope, a sign of rebellion.” And for me, in Chavarria's generous, joyous tailoring for men and women, there were unmistakable nods to zoot suits, the brightly-coloured, dandyish tailoring that Black and Hispanic youths wore as a form of protest through extravagance in the 1940s. They elicited violent reactions, too: in June 1943, in Chavarria's home state of California, what became known as the Zoot Suit Riots broke out, with American servicemen attacking young Latino and Mexican Americans. They stripped them of their zoot suits, ostensibly because they considered their profligate use of fabric unpatriotic against the backdrop of wartime rationing. In fact, of course, it was racially motivated violence, tinged with fear and loathing. History, it seems is repeating itself. Willy Chavarria Spring/Summer 2026Photography by Harry MillerWilly Chavarria Spring/Summer 2026Photography by Harry Miller Why did those suits excite rage? Because they refused to be silenced.

La medida fue tomada el 27 de marzo de 2025 como una acción preventiva tras reportes de efectos adversos por parte de consumidores. ¿Cuáles son los ingredientes que contiene este producto? Según el sitio oficial de Colgate y la tienda verificada de Amazon, los ingredientes de esta crema dental son: - Ingrediente activo: ​Fluoruro estañoso 0.454 % (equivalente a 0.15 % de ion flúor). - Otros ingredientes: ​Sorbitol, agua, sílice hidratada, glicerina, saborizantes (menta), lauril sulfato de sodio, pirofosfato tetrapotásico, goma de celulosa, nitrato de potasio, sacarina sódica, goma xantana, betaína de cocamidopropilo y dióxido de titanio. La combinación de flúor con agentes limpiadores como el lauril sulfato de sodio podría intensificar los efectos en mucosas sensibles, según publicaciones revisadas en PubMed sobre irritación oral relacionada con dentífricos. Usuarios denunciaron casos de ardor, úlceras, inflamación, ampollas y sensibilidad extrema tras usar la pasta, según comunicados de Anvisa. El componente señalado como posible causante es el flúor estañoso (stannous fluoride), un agente antibacterial que, aunque eficaz, puede provocar reacciones irritativas en ciertas personas.

n13c3nb,"  SPR_COMBO[sv]Förmodar att det är nya Sensodyne Repair and protect med Novamin. De kostar ordinarie 74 kr men kan fås ibland för 40 kr på nätapotek. I mitt tycke, med blottat dentin är det värt de få tiorna per månad mot en Colgate för 15 kr. Det känns också betydligt bättre i munnen efteråt, vilket även flera av de lite dyrare 30 kr varianterna av Oral-B Pro Expert och Sensodyne Pro Emalj gör. Om det har någon verkligt påtaglig långvarig effekt för emaljen är oklart, men det är ändå ingen utgift att bråka. Om någon föredrar den och tycker den är bra, låt det vara. Tandvård är betydligt mer kostsamt och vänta tills du hör vad en flaska Kerastase hårschampo och balsam kostar 😱 Hade en diskussion med ChatGPT om Sensodyne Repair & Protect innan jag provade  själv. Sensodyne Repair & Protect med 5 % NovaMin marknadsförs som en tandkräm som kan återuppbygga emaljen och täppa till blottade dentinkanaler, vilket minskar ilningar. NovaMin är ett varumärke för bioaktivt glas (kalcium-natrium-fosfosilikat), som frisätter kalcium- och fosfationener när det kommer i kontakt med saliv. Dessa joner kan bidra till att bilda ett mineral-liknande skikt (hydroxyapatit) på tändernas yta. Vad säger forskningen? Det finns viss vetenskaplig evidens för att NovaMin kan hjälpa till att: - Minska ilningar (dentinsensitivitet). - Främja remineralisering av emaljen under vissa förhållanden. Men: Studierna varierar i kvalitet och många är finansierade av tillverkaren. Det finns inte starka, oberoende långtidsstudier som bevisar att emaljen faktiskt ""byggs upp igen"" till samma styrka som tidigare. Vanlig fluoridtandkräm (t.ex. Colgate med natriumfluorid) är mycket väldokumenterad när det gäller kariesförebyggande effekt och remineralisering. Är det värt priset? Om du lider av ilningar eller har blottlagt dentin, kan Sensodyne med NovaMin vara värd pengarna, men för en frisk person med normal emalj är skillnaden mot vanlig fluortandkräm sannolikt marginell i praktiken.","SPR_COMBO[sv]Förmodar att det är nya Sensodyne Repair and protect med Novamin.

So let's say they have 17 Colgate toothpaste tubes and 3 knock offs. They just dump everything together and then ship it out. Even though they have 3 annoyed customers they have 17 happy ones. This model is profitable for them. So you can do your research and make sure it is a reputable brand and still end up with unsafe poorly made products. Also Amazon will make their own products based on what their competitors sell that is successful.

Find everything from toothpaste and body wash to baby wipes and dishwasher tablets, all at a fraction of the price. ð° Genuinely great value bulk buys to shop now ð° Finish Grab this twin pack of 83 dishwasher tablets (totalling 166 tablets) for a lot less on Amazon. For just one bag of 83, it usually costs £31 (though it is on sale right now for £12). ð° Price comparison: At Ocado, one 83 pack is on offer for £13 reduced from £32, which is still more expensive than Amazon, while a pack of 120 tablets is £20 (down from £40). So, you can get 46 extra tablets for £2 more with this great value multipack. Andrex Toilet roll might not be the most exciting bargain, but there's no denying that bulk buying household essentials like this is a clever move. Not only will it save you money in the long term, but it will also prevent you from spending more on smaller packs at your local supermarket. ð° Price comparison: At Asda (and most supermarkets) you'll find a four-pack of Andrex Gentle Clean Toilet Roll costs £2.48. You'd have to buy 11 packs to get 44 rolls, which adds up to a total of £27.28. Meanwhile, at Tesco, a pack of 24 Andrex Gentle Clean Toilet Tissue will cost you £11.75, so 48 rolls would cost you £23.50. To give a broader sense of bulk buying prices, Cheeky Panda's pack of 45 sustainable bamboo toilet rolls costs £32.50, while 48 rolls of Who Gives a Crap recycled toilet paper will set you back a massive £44. Amazon's also offering a solid saving on a massive 72-pack of Andrex - down from £37.50 to £27.42.

Whether you're navigating sandy dunes or winding through wildflower-lined mountain paths, the right footwear is essential for an enjoyable experience. To help you find the best hiking shoes for your next adventure, we spoke with outdoor enthusiasts and experienced hikers. What to Look for in Hiking Shoes Shopping for hiking shoes requires considering several key factors.” A great pair needs to be lightweight, waterproof, provide stability, and look good,” says Alison F. Heisler,hiking enthusiast,former D1 lacrosse athlete at Colgate,and founding member of LaunchBreak. “It's a small detail, but the laces are critically important – they shouldn't fray and need to tighten securely. I have narrow feet, so I need to ensure my foot doesn't slip inside the boot. Also, the best boots are always aligned with the socks you plan to wear. I use lighter-weight wool socks for trekking and running socks for trail runs, so I always try boots on with my socks.” Stephanie Beale, outdoor enthusiast and owner of GoatsTrail.com, adds another pro tip: break in your shoes before hitting the trails. “I prefer to wear them around the house or in the yard for a few hours,” she explains. “I don't like to start a long hike with brand new shoes without knowing how they'll feel after extended wear. If I can comfortably wear them for a few hours during normal walking, I know they'll likely be good for a longer hike.” Now, let's explore some top-rated hiking boots and shoes, as recommended by passionate hikers. 1. Salomon X Ultra 360 Mid Gore-tex Salomon's X Ultra 360 Mid Gore-Tex is a popular choice, praised for its rugged outsole, sleek design, waterproof membrane, and comfortable fit. “This was my go-to boot for a recent 10-day trek in bolivia through the Andes mountains,” Alison shares. “The terrain was uneven and we hiked through a lot of rain. This boot kept my foot dry, and I felt extremely stable. I didn't get a single blister!” RELATED: 6 Best Walking Workouts You Can Do on Your Local Track 2. Salewa Pedroc Air The Salewa Pedroc Air offers a lightweight and breathable design specifically for female hikers.” I love these hiking shoes,” says Alison. “They excel in so many areas.

Whalen, the longest-tenured Division I head coach at one school, won 11 Ivy League Red Rolfe Division titles, two Ivy League crowns, and his teams made two NCAA Tournament appearances. Since Whalen took over, Dartmouth has had 31 Major League Baseball draft picks, with six reaching the majors.

n1hcqlb,"  If the main issue is the mint in the dental products, could you try a product marketed towards kids? My 12 year old son is AuDHD and can't use mint because no matter how mild, it's a sensation he cannot handle. I Googled a lot a few years ago, because he also didn't care for all of the bubblgum flavors marketed to kids, and we ended up on Hello products. They have fruit flavors both with and without fluoride and we've successfully used most of them. He really likes the Mermaid (orange dreamcicle) and Dragon (blue raspberry) flavors, but grape and strawberry were well received too.

1lt2h6e,"  Hi everyone. I've seen posts like these in this subreddit and I have noted several ways people have experimented and reduced/reversed cavities. I recently got 6 cavities filled and why they happened in the first place is because of a number of reasons - 1. genetic predisposition 2. continued use of Colgate visible white ""enamel safe"" toothpaste for a few years 2x a day (I did 2x then to improve my oral health without knowing the abrasive effects of such toothpastes 🤦🏻‍♀️) 3. pitted molars 4. a monthly sick year of 2023 (legit sick every month) could've led to immunity loss and contributed to enamel health because of low iron and b12. Recently, my mental health has turned shit and I feel I betrayed myself by doing pt.2. I am talking to a therapist aboutmy health anxiety but it's honestly pretty bad lol. I cry constantly now and feel catastrophic all the time. This teeth situation is feeding onto my low self esteem and worth. I want to know, is there anyway I can ""STRENGTHEN"" my teeth naturally, NOT NECESSARILY reverse cavities? I am shit scared of them breaking and falling off etc. and feel addressing this will tremendously help. Some things I've picked up here- 1. nanohydroxyapatit toothpaste (switched to Biomin one in Jan but will switch to this) and especially letting it sit on teeth in trays(?) Can I just spit and let it be? 2. oil pulling 3. K2 tablets? ( I get homeopathic medicine, kinda aversive to allopathy but I'm not sure my doc would rightaway tell me to take these) 4. Low sugar carbs- ironically my teeth were splendid in childhood when I wasn't brushing 2x and had a big sweet tooth but worsened when I reversed the habits lol. maybe my childhood habits caught up?? 5. brushing or rinsing after every meal (making a habit of it now) Is there anything else? I would love your help and find a way to the light","Hi everyone. I've seen posts like these in this subreddit and I have noted several ways people have experimented and reduced/reversed cavities.

Navigo 집계에 따르면 이번 2분기는 미국 내 경제적 역풍이 지속되면서, 뷰티 카테고리 전반에서 검색과 참여가 약화됐다. 뷰티 및 퍼스널 케어 카테고리 검색량은 1분기 대비 16% 감소했고, 광고 없이 소비자 검색만으로 메인 페이지에 노출되는 '가시성'은 9.9% 떨어졌다. 브랜드들의 광고 활동은 0.3% 증가하며 보합세를 보였다. 효율성 중심의 광고를 선호하는 경향이 강해지고 있다. 구체적으로 뷰티 카테고리 매출 상위 브랜드는 △세라비(CERAVE, 매출점유율 8.6%) △뉴트라폴(NutraFol, 7.9%) △라로슈포제(La Roche-Posay, 5.5%) △클린 스킨 클럽(Clean Skin Club, 5.0%) △메디큐브(Medicube, 4.6%) △마이티패치(Mighty Patch, 4.4%) △솔 드 자네이루(Sol De Janeiro, 3.9%) △엘타엠디(ELTAMD, 3.7%) △폴라초이스(Paula's Choice, 3.5%) △뉴트로지나(Neutrogena, 3.1%) 순이다. 매출 상위 10개 브랜드가 뷰티 카테고리 전체 매출의 50%를 차지했다. 엘타엠디는 매출이 2.6% 증가하며 처음 10위권에 진입했다. 솔 드 자네이루도 매출이 1.5% 늘어나며 지난 분기 11위에서 7위로 올라왔다. 반면 라로슈포제와 뉴트라폴은 순위는 유지했으나 각각 매출이 1.0%, 0.3% 떨어진 것으로 나타났다. 뷰티 카테고리 매출 기준 상위 10개 제품엔 바이오던스(BIODANCE)의 '바이오 콜라겐 리얼 딥 마스크(Bio-Collagen Real Deep Mask)'와 메디큐브의 '제로 포어 패드 2.0(Zero Pore Pads 2.0)이 각각 8, 9위에 랭크됐다. 지난 분기 대비 5순위 뛰어오른 바이오던스 제품의 매출 점유율은 3% 미만이다. 뷰티 카테고리에서 광고를 가장 많이 한 브랜드는 △엘프(E.L.F) △웨이(OUAI) △도브(DOVE) △뉴트로지나 △로라 젤러 뉴욕(Laura Geller Newyork) △뉴트라폴 △랑콤(LANCOME) △비틀스 젤 폴리쉬(BEETLES GEL POLISH) △로레알 파리(LOREAL PARIS) △콜게이트(COLGATE) 순으로 확인됐다. 스폰서십 상위 10위권엔 국내 브랜드나 제품은 없었다. 1분기에 이어 국내 브랜드들은 다른 브랜드 대비 광고 집행율이 낮지만, 효율적인 매출 구조로 상위권에 오르고 있다. 스킨케어 카테고리 내 매출 상위 10위권에는 메디큐브와 바이오던스가 포함됐다. 매출 상위 10개 브랜드는 순서대로 △세라비(12.80%) △라로슈포제(7.80%) △메디큐브(6.50%) △엘타엠디(5.20%) △클린 스킨 클럽(4.70%) △폴라초이스(4.10%) △마이티 패치(4.10%) △디오디너리(THE ORDINARY, 3.40%) △바이오던스(3.20%) △도브(3.00%). 스킨케어 카테고리 매출 증가율은 엘타엠디가 2.2%로 증가로 가장 높았고, 메디큐브가 1.7% 상승해 두 번째로 높게 나타났다. 반면 세라비와 라로슈포제는 각각 2%, 1.1% 감소했다. 스킨케어 카테고리에서도 광고활동이 활발했던 브랜드 상위 10개 목록엔 국내 브랜드는 포함되지 않았다. 다만 제품 기준 광고활동 상위 목록엔 바이오던스의 '바이오 콜라겐 리얼 딥 마스크' 제품이 7위에 랭크됐다. NAVIGO의 분석에 따르면 바이오던스는 '제품 구매를 고려하고 있는 대상'에 집중적으로 광고를 집행했다. 제품 기준 매출 상위 10위 목록에도 바이오던스 '바이오 콜라겐 리얼 딥 마스크'(6위)와 메디큐브 '제로 포어 패드 2.0', '듀얼 텍스처 페이셜 토너 패드(Dual-Textured Facial Toner Pads)가 각각 6, 7위에 올랐다. NAVIGO는 ""K-뷰티의 강한 모멘텀이 작용해, 바이오던스와 메디큐브 제품의 스킨케어 매출 점유율이 2.9~3.2% 수준으로 올라왔다""고 설명했다. 향수, 헤어케어, 메이크업 카테고리의 매출 점유율 상위 10위권에 든 국내 브랜드는 없었다. 다만 1분기와 마찬가지로, 아누아(AUNA)의 '하트리프 포어 컨트롤 클렌징 오일(Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil)'이 메이크업 카테고리 6위에 이름을 올렸다. 아누아 제품은 메이크업 카테고리 내 매출점유율 3.2%로, 강력한 '중위권'으로 자리매김했다. NAVIGO는 ""2분기 아마존 뷰티 카테고리에선 '히어로 제품' 중심의 SKU를 보유한 브랜드가 높은 성과를 거뒀고, 피부과 전문의가 뒷받침하는 다기능·혜택 중심의 제품의 성공이 돋보였다""고 분석했다. 가격 정책보단 제품에 대한 신뢰와 명확성이 판매량을 늘리는 방법이라는 분석이다. 아울러 NAVIGO는 ""3분기엔 소비자의 기대치가 더욱 높아질 예정이며, 크로스 채널의 시너지가 차별화 요소가 될 것""이라며 ""관세 불확실성으로 인해 재고 계획이 불안정한 상황이니, 해외 생산 브랜드는 마진 압박을 피하기 위해 프라임데이 대비 가격 책정 및 프로모션 전략을 조기에 확정해야 한다""고 제언했다. |

mov_AEFB248551A03D17FC51A9B3597B02CE,"  A sense of déjà vu permeates the latest report on brand trust. Morning Consult's 2025 Most Reputable Brands analysis reveals that the companies consumers rely on most today bear a striking resemblance to those favored during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. This resurgence of trust in established brands underscores a continued prioritization of safety, security, and essential needs, even as the world navigates a new normal. The report, which surveyed consumers across all demographics, highlights a consistent preference for brands associated with cleanliness, health, and reliable service. But what does this sustained loyalty tell us about the evolving consumer mindset and the enduring power of established brands in a rapidly changing world? Across all consumer touchpoints, a handful of categories consistently emerged as leaders in brand trust. These include: Home Keeping and Hygiene: Brands like Dawn, Clorox, Lysol, Mr. Clean, and Home Depot continue to be cornerstones of consumer confidence. Self- and Personal Care: Dove, Oral-B, Kleenex, and Colgate remain trusted staples in daily routines. Health: BAND-AID and Tylenol exemplify the enduring trust in brands providing essential healthcare solutions. Packages and Shipping/Ecommerce: UPS, Amazon, the United States Postal Service, and FedEx are vital for modern commerce and maintain high levels of consumer trust. And, let's not forget the comfort factor: Hershey's and M&M's demonstrate that even indulgence can be a source of reliable satisfaction. Maslow's Hierarchy and the Modern Consumer These favored brands directly address fundamental human needs, as outlined in Maslow's Hierarchy. From physiological needs (food, hygiene) to safety and security, consumers are gravitating towards brands that provide a sense of stability and well-being. This isn't simply nostalgia; it's a reflection of ongoing anxieties and a desire for predictability in an uncertain world. Deeper Dive: Trust Across Specific Verticals Morning Consult's analysis extended beyond broad categories, examining trust within specific consumer verticals.

Younger consumers, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, demonstrate a growing trust in social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube, while older generations tend to favor legacy brands with established reputations. This generational gap highlights the evolving role of media and marketing in shaping consumer perceptions. Adweek's analysis provides further insight into these differing perspectives. Pro Tip: Building brand trust requires consistent delivery on promises, transparent communication, and a genuine commitment to customer well-being. The Rise of Health and Sustainability Concerns Recent data from the dunnhumby Consumer Trends Tracker reinforces the growing importance of health and sustainability for U.S. consumers. Two-thirds of consumers prioritize sourcing products that align with their dietary needs, and nearly half believe retailers should actively support healthy choices. This trend extends to a preference for local businesses and products, driven by a desire for transparency and connection. As the 2025 Edelman Trust Barometer demonstrates, trust is increasingly built through local relationships rather than distant national brands. However, economic realities are also impacting consumer behavior. With potential cuts to SNAP benefits and rising food costs, one in four U.S. households, and over a third of those aged 18-34, have been forced to skip meals in the past year. This underscores the critical role of food security and the need for accessible, affordable nutrition.

mov_AF809FF346DBADB942ACEDB7FA38DD4B,"  The award-winning “Magic Duos,” out of home campaign reminded people that the combination of their favourite food and an ice-cold Coca-Cola is magic. When CEO Rob Guénette stood at the helm of a newly merged VML Canada, bringing Taxi and Wunderman Thompson together, he knew the easiest route would be the wrong one. Simply fusing old cultures from the separate firms – Taxi having made its mark with influential creative and Wunderman building its reputation on CRM, commerce, data and tech – wasn't going to be enough. He wanted to build something entirely new: a fresh company that could, from day one, be a serious contender on the national stage. OLG Ontario Racing Unfiltered, a gripping docuseries, brought the raw, behind-the-scenes world of horse racing to life, helping a new audience fall in love with the sport. And in just over a year, with over 500 employees across Montréal, Toronto and Vancouver offices, the agency has done just that through deliberate leadership choices, an ambitious vision and a culture that prioritizes creativity and connection. “We established the leadership very quickly, so that set the tone,” Guénette says. And then he and Graham Lang, CCO, set one clear goal: “We have to come out of this, not only with a successful merger, but also to land in the top five most creative agencies in Canada with a body of work that represents the totality of our capabilities.” Lang highlights that VML Canada ranked fourth in the Strategy 2025 Creative Report Card. The agency now consistently tops creative industry benchmarks. But behind those wins lies a deliberate philosophy that Guénette and his team installed from the very start: a culture of creativity, connection and integration. At the heart of VML Canada's approach is the philosophy of creating “Connected Brands” – brands that meet customers with the right mix of humanity, persuasion and commerce at every stage of their journey. VML's integrated structure flows across three pillars, with Brand Experience, Customer Experience and Commerce under one roof. The company sees itself as a band of doers, innovators and believers in humanity. And for Guénette, those words are more than branding – they are the spirit behind every piece of work, whether it's a simple in-store shelf talker or a national television spot, the commitment to high creativity remains the same. “Pride Unravelled,” transformed data into a powerful visual statement and turned complex truths into an unforgettable celebration of identity and impact. VML's geographic reach is key to their success in a multicultural country like Canada. Québec isn't an afterthought, for example, it's built into every national campaign from the start. In fact, some national accounts are run entirely out of Montréal or Vancouver, reflecting the agency's inclusive model. Improv star Pier-Luc Funk electrified the screen in San Émission, the award-winning comedy special that transformed a TV station's dead airtime into a four-hour overnight hit powered by the all-electric Volkswagen. This approach has paid off, with standout campaigns like Volkswagen's “Sans Émissions” emerging from the Montréal office, which won a Grand Clio for Media. A simple but powerful double entendre, the campaign transformed Québec's TV “off-air” screens into a metaphor for Volkswagen's zero-emission vehicles, earning top global recognition and helping the automaker's electrification efforts resonate in a culturally authentic way. Other major accounts like Coca-Cola, Mazda, Fido, OLG, Vancity, Colgate and Kruger have also benefited from VML's distinctly Canadian storytelling. Guénette also explains that VML Canada negotiated significant local autonomy despite being part of the world's largest agency network, with over 30,000 employees globally. Technological innovation is also playing a part in the agency's future. Through VML's access to WPP Open, a proprietary AI-powered platform, the team can accelerate research and production without sacrificing creative quality. Though AI isn't a replacement for human insight, Guénette sees it as a powerful enabler. VML helped Coca-Cola Fuze make its Canadian debut with a bold launch campaign and introduced a fresh new brand with a familiar flavour to audiences across the country. Looking ahead, VML Canada's focus is on smart, sustainable growth. With a challenging economic landscape and uncertain global tensions, the agency is doubling down on deepening relationships with existing clients, strengthening their customer experience and commerce capabilities and applying their full creative force across every touchpoint. Ultimately, Guénette believes the balance between deep national pride and global connectedness is what sets VML Canada apart. That's why VML Canada's mantra is “Fiercely local. Proudly global.” CONTACT: Matt Shoom-Kirsch Chief operating officer matt.shoom-kirsch@vml.com The 2025 A-Listers: Intro Zulu Alpha Kilo: Connecting creativity and impact Mosaic: An era where anything's possible Agnostic: Rewriting narratives in service of the work Weber Shandwick: Where culture, creativity and tech collide Dentsu: Humanity in the age of algorithms Lifelong Crush: Sparking long-term devotion C&B Advertising: Leading with emotion PHD Canada: An intelligent transformation The Hive: Doubling down on beating boring Touché! : Flexing Canadian media muscle...","The award-winning “Magic Duos,” out of home campaign reminded people that the combination of their favourite food and an ice-cold Coca-Cola is magic.

Awarded in the 'Media (Use of Digital Platforms)' and 'Direct (Corporate Purpose & Social Responsibility)' categories, the wins recognized the RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA initiative as a bold collaboration between VTEX, Artplan, Desierto Vestido and Fashion Revolution, becoming a blueprint in enterprise circular commerce. In addition to the two Bronze Lions recognitions, RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA was also shortlisted in four additional categories. The Atacama Desert has become a global symbol of excess production, receiving more than 40,000 tons of retail waste every year, mainly from North America and Europe. RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA wasn't just about spotlighting a crisis. It was about proving the versatile power of digital commerce. Each garment was hand-selected, sanitized, and restored. Many were unworn, still bearing original brand tags. The inventory was redistributed at no cost, with consumers only paying for shipping. Winning two Bronze Lions over hundreds of submissions comes off the heels of VTEX, being recognized as the only vendor named a Gartner® Customers' Choice in the 2025 Voice of the Customer for Digital Commerce report for the second year in a row. The Impact of RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA: Activated the first globally scalable circular commerce model from recovered desert fast fashion waste, and powered by a simplified and adaptable enterprise-grade digital commerce platform. Redistributed inventory to consumers in 10+ countries around the globe. Sold out inventory in just under five hours without paid media. Generated a whopping 200,000 signups for future waste drops. Delivered branded UX, storytelling, and packaging that sparked global connection and community towards a larger movement. Built in full collaboration: Desierto Vestido (recovery), Fashion Revolution Brazil (upcycle), Artplan (creative), VTEX (commerce engine). Mariano Gomide de Faria, Founder and Co-CEO of VTEX, said: ""RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA winning two Bronze Lions at Cannes 2025 sends a clear message: commerce can do more than scale global enterprise brands. With the remarkable partnership of Artplan, Desierto Vestido, and Fashion Revolution, we have proven how adaptable digital commerce platforms can correct, redistribute, and challenge the logic of excess. At VTEX, we're proud to have disrupted the model of linear consumption. This is one of the most urgent and transformative campaigns we've been part of this year, and it signals to other digital commerce platforms that neutrality In the conversation of retail waste is no longer an option. RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA has set the standard for global impact as value is defined by what is recovered, not just by what is sold."" Built for viability over virality, RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA is now evolving into a long-term solution. In partnership with the University of Chile, the next phase focuses on transforming volunteer roles into paid work, generating local income, and formalizing the recovery and redistribution of discarded garments. The goal is a sustainable environmental and economic model led by a strong community. As AI reshapes the future of commerce, RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA is a case study in purposeful design meeting adaptable digital infrastructure. When intention is rooted in impact, transformation scales.

mov_392E81CF3A85400B2690AB79FE03A3B0,"  In this column, the usual roles are reversed, and I answer questions about my new book, “Franklin High School: Two Basketball Dynasties.” Question: What is your new book about? Answer: It is a book about the memoirs of Michael Ferrara. He was a legend in basketball in Sussex County during the 1970s. Q: What inspired the book? A: I caught up with Mike a year or so ago. He was keenly interested in recording his life in the sport of basketball and getting his experiences for others to have. As we are alumni of Franklin High School, we were aware that there were two times when basketball at our school was tremendously popular and successful. One era was in the 1950s or so with Coach Reginald Purdy. Another time was in the 1970s with the Stefkoviches and also Mike Ferrara. Q. Tell me about Ferrara. A. Mike grew up down near the city and his family moved to Pleasant Valley Lake in Vernon. He went to Franklin High School, which was still operating as such and had done so until the early 1980s. The kids now go to Wallkill Valley Regional High School. Mike became an outstanding player on the high school basketball team and went on to play at Colgate University and then was drafted into the NBA. Q: What are the highlights of his career? A. He started out in college at Niagara University and then moved to Colgate. While at Colgate, he scored 1,763 points, which was then a school record. He still holds the school record for points in a season, which is 772, and also the number of steals in a season of 94. He finished a very close second to the leading scorer in NCAA Division I during the 1980-81 season. During that time, Mike had a fantastic 28.6 points per game average. He was also named the Patriot Conference prestigious Player of the Year. Mike went on to be drafted by the Washington Bullets. He had a number of fascinating stories that he speaks about in the book. We also bring into play several of the important people in his life and athletic journey. Chiefly among them are the coaches he had. One was Coach Frank Virtue of his time at Franklin. Coach Virtue was beloved by many from the town. Through the book, Mike describes how influences by special people impacted his life, broadened his horizons and aided in the development as an exceptional player. Q. How is this book different from others you have written? A. This happens to be the seventh book that I have published. It is the first book where we were working on a memoir. The vigor that Mike had when we got together a year or so made me laugh. I had known him for some 40 years and he was always high-energy. But he still possessed the same level of enthusiasm and eagerness as way back when. He worked out daily near his home in Tampa, Fla., and had a strong regimen that he followed. Making the book was a fun time with him and interviewing our mutual old adviser, Coach Virtue. Q: Where can we get the book? A: “Franklin High School: Two Basketball Dynasties” is available at the Sparta Bookstore and Broad Street Books in Branchville. You also can get an e-version (Kindle) on Amazon along with a soft cover and a hard cover. Q: Any parting words? A: I certainly have mixed feelings on the book. You see, Mike, ole' #44 as he liked to be referred to (his retired number at Colgate), passed away on Sunday June 15. While he was full of his lifelong enthusiasm just a few months ago, he had been diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), often called Lou Gehrig's disease. While we didn't know it at the beginning, we worked hard to get the book done as soon as we could. As it turned out, I was only awaiting his last “yes” of approval on the back cover layout when he took deathly ill and was unable to reply with that one word. So, while the book is fantastic, the culmination was disheartening....","In this column, the usual roles are reversed, and I answer questions about my new book, “Franklin High School: Two Basketball Dynasties.” Question: What is your new book about?

mov_070BD393CED7A579E542E8EE1255E051,"  NEW YORK (July 9, 2025) – The New York Sirens announced today that defender Allyson Simpson has been re-signed to a two-year Professional Women's Hockey League (PWHL) Standard Player Agreement through the 2026-27 season. “Knowing that Allyson will be with us for at least the next two seasons adds to this wave of youth,” said Sirens General Manager Pascal Daoust. “It's her talent, speed, and leadership that we're proud and excited to build with and around.” The 24-year-old from Fort Worth, Texas, was a constant presence on the ice in her rookie season, appearing in all 30 games after being selected by New York in the third round of the 2024 PWHL Draft. She tallied four assists and added one goal, finishing the year with five points which tied for fourth among rookie rearguards. “I'm thrilled to be re-signing with the Sirens as we continue to create something special with this organization,” said Simpson. “I'm excited to play a role in the league's continued growth while helping shape the Sirens into a championship team. I can't wait to get back on the ice with my teammates, old and new, and give everything I have for them and the fans who have supported us from day one.” Before turning pro, Simpson honed her skills under Head Coach Greg Fargo at Colgate University, where she played for five seasons. She appeared in 174 games and recorded 107 points, capped by a career-high 34 points (9G, 25A) in 40 games during the 2023-24 campaign. She led the Raiders to a Frozen Four berth after scoring the game-winning goal against Cornell. Internationally, Simpson won back-to-back gold medals with Team USA at the 2017 and 2018 IIHF U18 Women's World Championships. The 5'8” Simpson returns to a Sirens lineup that has five other defenders under contract for the 2025-26 season, including Lauren Bernard, Jaime Bourbonnais, Maja Nylén Persson, Jincy Roese and captain Micah Zandee-Hart.

She tallied four assists and added one goal, finishing the year with five points which tied for fourth among rookie rearguards. “I'm thrilled to be re-signing with the Sirens as we continue to create something special with this organization,” said Simpson. “I'm excited to play a role in the league's continued growth while helping shape the Sirens into a championship team. I can't wait to get back on the ice with my teammates, old and new, and give everything I have for them and the fans who have supported us from day one.” Before turning pro, Simpson honed her skills under Head Coach Greg Fargo at Colgate University, where she played for five seasons. She appeared in 174 games and recorded 107 points, capped by a career-high 34 points (9G, 25A) in 40 games during the 2023-24 campaign. She led the Raiders to a Frozen Four berth after scoring the game-winning goal against Cornell. Internationally, Simpson won back-to-back gold medals with Team USA at the 2017 and 2018 IIHF U18 Women's World Championships. The 5'8” Simpson returns to a Sirens lineup that has five other defenders under contract for the 2025-26 season, including Lauren Bernard, Jaime Bourbonnais, Maja Nylén Persson, Jincy Roese and captain Micah Zandee-Hart.

Learn more Shoppers making the move from manual to electric toothbrushes might want to dive into Amazon Prime Day 2025's oral-care offers as there are some sparkling deals on top brands. The likes of Oral-B and Philips have slashed the prices on some of their gadgets, providing a great opportunity to upgrade a dental routine for less. With discounts of up to £310 off, there are some serious savings to be had and as a shopping writer who has tried and tested over five electric toothbrushes from Oral-B, SURI and more, my hand-picked deals make spotting the best ones a whole lot easier. While a manual brush can do the job, they have nothing on their tech counterparts in terms of ease, functionality and overall results. As the average person spends more than 80 days in their life cleaning their teeth, it's well worth investing in a high quality brush - and these deals mean you don't have to spend a fortune. READ MORE: 'I'm a beauty writer - the new ghd curling wand gave me perfect waves in 15 mins' READ MORE: The best electric toothbrush tested as Oral-B, Philips and Ordo compared To take advantage of the deals customers will need to be a member of Amazon Prime. Those that are not can sign up for a free 30 day trial and enjoy discounts during the duration of Amazon Prime Day. Elsewhere, Oral-B are also running a summer sale, with bundles including free toothbrush heads, toothpaste, mouthwash and more. It is also Boots 'super savings week' and shoppers can find discounts on electricals from brush-baby, Oral-B, Colgate and Philips.

Usually £8.99 a month, you can now get a 30-day free trial to get access to the latest deals. Oral-B iO2 Electric Toothbrush, now £40, was £100 With a 60% off discount, the Oral-B iO2 model is now £39.99 reduced from £100. This beats the price of Boots and the Oral-B website, where it is on sale for £45. It's a top of the range toothbrush as it boasts three brushing modes (daily clean, sensitive and super sensitive), a gum pressure sensor and a 30 second timer letting the user know when to clean a different part of the mouth. It also comes with a travel case, for less than £40 all in. There are various different colours in stock, from black to white, plus spending £3 extra means customers can get a sturdier case with a special design. One shopper was left very impressed with the 'long lasting battery' and another said its 'smooth and quiet clean' has 'exceeded expectations'. Someone else said the 'vibration feels a little rough', but they got used to the sensation 'pretty quickly'. Oral-B iO8 Electric Toothbrush, now £139, was £450 Saving shoppers more than £300, the Oral-B iO8 can be snapped up for £139.99, down from £450. Nearly 70% off, this mega deal has been hailed 'good value for money' as it is a 'five star toothbrush'. Features include six cleaning modes (daily clean, sensitive, whiten, gum care, intense and super sensitive) and sensor alerts. Oral-B's iO8 model takes things up a notch in terms of dentalcare as it boasts AI intelligence, recognising your brushing style and guiding you via an app. The real-time feedback is 'impressive' and 'by far the best' for some, while others found it 'not necessary'. SURI Electric Toothbrush, now £56, was £75 The SURI Sustainable Electric Toothbrush is the device I have been using for the last two years - and it's still serving me well. I find it is reducing my cost of hygienist visits and I've even has friends ask me where I got the toothbrush from when away on trips. On sale at Amazon for £56.25, it is incredibly lightweight, making it perfect for travel, and it comes in four stylish colours. The eco-friendly gadget has been designed to clean teeth with a minimal impact on the environment, using brush heads made from plant-based materials. It is important to note that users will have to stick to the SURI brush heads and you can pick up a pack of three for £14.99. The brand also offers a brush head subscription service. SURI toothbrushes are also 25% off on their website as part of the summer sale. Shoppers can read my full review here. Philips Sonicare 6100 Electric Toothbrush, now £99, was £290 Having tried the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Prestige 9900, I can vouch that the brand make an exceptional toothbrush. This model in particular is on sale for Prime, but is still at the pricier end of the scale at £199.99, down from £267. Those looking to spend under £100 can nab the Philips Sonicare 6100 model for £99.99, reduced from £290. A saving of £200, the toothbrush comes with two spare brush heads and a nifty travel case.

mov_ABD586C06AF3EAA7CABD6593FCAA7F4A,"  CBA forward Jack Donohue could be the latest in a line of former Siena ball boys to make their names as Division I basketball players. Donohue worked as a Saints ball boy for four seasons. He began under former coach Mitch Buonaguro and continued for Jimmy Patsos, a friend of Donohue's father, Darren. ""It was great,"" Jack Donohue said. ""I loved it. At halftime, you're able to play. When you roll out the balls, you're able to shoot a little bit before you get in trouble. It was fun to be out on the court, like you were a Division I athlete at the age of 10."" It's possible Donohue, entering his junior year of high school, could make MVP Arena his home in college. Siena coach Gerry McNamara has offered him a scholarship. But the Saints have growing competition for Donohue, who is 6-foot-7 and 215 pounds. He has been offered by several other schools, including the University at Albany, Bryant and Pennsylvania. Bryant coach Jamion Christian and Penn coach Fran McCaffery are former Siena coaches. ""He's a very good shooter,"" said dad Darren, a Shaker graduate. ""He's very tangible, is what all the coaches say. He can rebound, he can run, he's strong and he can really shoot the ball well."" Jack Donohue said he's talking to Siena, UAlbany, Penn, Bryant and La Salle about setting up official visits in August and September. He's also speaking with Colgate and Harvard. Assuming he gets to Division I, Donohue will continue a Siena ball boy tradition. McCaffery's sons Connor and Patrick served that role for the Saints before following their father to his next job at Iowa. They played for him with the Hawkeyes. Brothers Kevin and Thomas Huerter were also Siena ball boys. Kevin spent two seasons at Maryland, became a NBA first-round draft pick and now plays for the Chicago Bulls. Thomas played for Siena, his father Tom's alma mater. Siena offered Donohue last month. ""To be local and have such a great program, and the history of the program be held on a pedestal, it's great to be having them reach out to me,"" he said. ""The relationship's grown since then. They're always reaching out to me, which is nice."" The Donohues credit much of Jack's development to his play with the New Jersey Shoreshots, an AAU program directed by former Rutgers and Robert Morris coach Mike Rice. Donahue played this spring for the 16-and-under team. Quinton Redding, his 16U coach, said he watched Donohue develop from a catch-and-shoot player into someone who has the confidence to put the ball on the floor and become a stronger rebounder. ""I feel like he was maybe just trying to fit in, and told him just to be himself,"" Redding said. ""He's here for a reason. Once he heard that advice, he did his thing and took off."" Redding said Donohue had his breakout performance at an Under Armour tournament in Hamilton, Ohio in May. He shot better than 40% from 3-point range and rebounded well. ""I think he's a mid-major (college prospect) right now and, by the time he gets to his senior year, he has the potential to be a Power Five player,"" Redding said. Darren, his father, said Stanford and Notre Dame have reached out, but without offers, so far. Jack Donohue gets at least some of his height and talent from his mother, Danielle (Galarneau) Donohue, a 6-foot-1 Troy native. She's in the Marist Hall of Fame after scoring 1,141 points and grabbing 833 rebounds for the Red Foxes. ""She played down in the post, so anytime I have any questions about being a post player, or just footwork-wise down low, I always go to her because I know how successful she was on the court,"" Jack said. He returns next season to a talented CBA team that includes star teammate JJ Osinski, son of former Siena star Corey Osinski. When was a ball boy, Jack Donohue envisioned playing for Siena. He's getting closer to reaching Division I, whether for the Saints or somewhere else. ""Just playing at that level alone was a dream of mine,"" he said. ""To now be living it, it's pretty cool.""

She is currently President, Beauty & Wellbeing, Unilever. Story continues below In an exchange filing, the FMCG major said that she replaces Rohit Jawa, who will step down as CEO and MD on July 31, 2025 to pursue the next chapter in his personal and professional journey. According to analysts, Priya Nair will provide the FMCG player with the required boost to navigate the rising competitive challenges, while accelerating HUL's digital transformation efforts. Further, with her long-standing experience at HUL, she is well-positioned to help the firm capitalize on the evolving and long-term prospects of the Indian consumption market, stated Japan-based Nomura. The brokerage offered an example from Priya Nair's stint in the Home Care segment from 2014 to 2020. During this time, the segment's EBIT margin soared 570 basis points from 13.1 percent in FY14, to 18.8 percent in FY20. As a result, HUL's overall EBIR margin rose from 15 percent to 22.3 percent over the years. From 2020 to 2022, Priya Nair was instrumental in HUL's premiumization thrust. She drove the shift from from value offerings to the premium segment by driving 26 percent of HUL's portfolio focus towards premium demand spaces compared to 20 percent in 2020. With Nair stepping to the helm, HUL is likely to enter a new phase of growth and innovation, noted Nitin Paranjpe, Chairman, HUL. This will be very closely watched by experts, who have often voiced concerns around the FMCG player's underperformance compared to peers. Thanking Jawa for his contributions, Nitin Paranjpe, Chairman, HUL, said, “On behalf of the Board, I thank Rohit for steering the company through a challenging market and laying the foundations for future success. His strategic clarity and decisive actions further strengthened HUL's leadership.” Story continues below He added, “Priya has had an exemplary career across HUL and Unilever. With her deep knowledge of the Indian consumer and a global perspective, I am confident she will lead HUL into a new phase of growth and innovation.” Over the past five years, shares of HUL have recorded a mere eight percent uptick. However, the change should bring some comfort to the firm's stock price. Citi Research noted that management changes in the Indian consumer space have been a much talked about factor on Street. Further, in recent memory, the markets saw big rallies and eventual business performance improvements at Godrej Consumer and Colgate India, following a change in management. According to Goldman Sachs, HUL's volume growth will gradually improve over FY26. Morgan Stanley and Investec, both, noted that the departure of Rohit Jawa came as a surprise, given his shorter-than-expected stint. The brokerages also pointed to a recent reshuffle in HUL parent Unilever's CEO, with the former CEO stepping down in February. Macquarie, however, allayed concerns, noting that while the sudden departure of Rohit Jawa and the relatively short period of transition remain concerning, the brokerage gains comfort from Priya's long period of experience in India. Further, the change of guard will drive a stronger focus on growth, especially in the Beauty segment.

During this time, I neglected my oral hygiene and that led me to develop many cavities. Maybe around 20, I know, a lot. I ended up getting them filled not too long after. I was still left with weak enamel. Fast forward a few years later, I ended up having to get a gum graft. WORST experience ever. It was awful and I don't want to go through it again. I have tried to do everything. I try to floss daily. Brush 1 - 2 times a day. Enamel toothpaste burns so I just don't use it, I just stick to Colgate because it doesn't burn and seems to help a little bit. I do a water + salt rinse. Once a week I do a water + hydrogen peroxide mix. And on top of that I do oil pulling before I brush every night. I'm about to go to the dentist this week but I wanted opinions and suggestions before hand. I have had multiple dentists and they all said many different things. Some say you can reverse recession, others said I can't.
