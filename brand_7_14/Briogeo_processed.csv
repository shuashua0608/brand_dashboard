Growing concerns about hair fall, thinning, and scalp health are boosting the demand for specialized hair serums. Shoppers are gravitating toward clean, natural, and multifunctional products, which drive growth in this segment. Influencer promotions and social media conversations play a key role in raising product awareness and strengthening brand connections within the hair care market. In the U.S., androgenetic alopecia, commonly known as male or female pattern baldness, affects up to 70% of men and 40% of women. The emotional impact of hair thinning, including decreased confidence and self-esteem, has led many to seek effective treatment options. While clinical solutions like minoxidil and finasteride are available, their potential side effects and the necessity for prescriptions have prompted an increasing number of consumers to pursue non-invasive, user-friendly alternatives. Consequently, topical hair serums have become popular for their ease of use, natural or clinically supported ingredients, and suitability for daily application. U.S. consumers are increasingly favoring hair care products made with plant-based, organic, and environmentally friendly ingredients such as argan oil, green tea, and rosemary. They also expect brands to embody these values through sustainable and clean packaging. Supporting this trend, a CleanHub survey revealed that 81% of beauty shoppers want brands to reduce plastic use, 47% prefer recyclable packaging, and 40% favor refillable options.

In response, many styling serums now incorporate heat-protectant properties to shield hair during styling. A popular example in the U.S. is the TRESemmé Keratin Smooth Heat Protect Spray, which guards against temperatures up to 450°F. Enriched with keratin and marula oil, it helps reduce frizz, enhance shine, and prevent heat-related damage, making it a reliable choice for everyday styling. • Synthetic hair serums enjoy popularity among U.S. consumers due to their cost-effectiveness, dependable performance, and user-friendly nature. Typically crafted with silicones like dimethicone, these serums provide immediate benefits such as increased shine, frizz control, and a smooth texture that suits the fast-paced American lifestyle. For instance, Garnier Fructis Sleek & Shine Anti-Frizz Serum combines dimethicone with nourishing argan oil to deliver long-lasting smoothness, shine, and effective frizz protection, even in humid weather. . • Many U.S. consumers prefer to buy hair serums from pharmacies and drugstores because of their trusted product quality, expert pharmacist advice, convenient locations, and competitive prices. A Harris Poll found that 91% of consumers favor shopping for hair products in-store, appreciating the ability to see, touch, and sample items before purchasing, an experience more readily available at physical retail outlets.

1lhgnao,2025-06-22 05:50:01,en,REDDIT,"  My curls are often frizzy and inconsistent. I have rarely achieved that perfect smooth texture but when i have it seems spontaneous and for no good reason. The only difference is that i was sitting perfectly still for hours. (Can't figure out how to add another pic of what i mean) Rizzo's lightweight curl gel is the only thing i use for styling. I prefer to airdry but even if i use a diffuser my hair is frizzy. Don't get me wrong, i love my hair but i want her happier and healthier and would love to pin down a routine. For one, when i moved into my new apartment, my hair started shedding and falling out in the shower in a volume i haven't seen before. I have low iron and hypothyroidism so i know it could be attributed to health and i'm also going through a lot of stress. I still want to minimize anything that could be making my hair unhappy. I bought a shower filter from amazon because i believe the water is taking a toll. I am looking for shampoo and conditioner recs as well as some styling tips. Most of the time i let my hair do whatever but like i said the hair thinning is getting to me and its been getting tangled a lot easier too. Routine: - briogeo scalp oil for an hour before washes - maui milk coconut shampoo - dove coconut & hydration conditioner - rizzo's curls light hold gel while wet brush while wet, scrunch in a small amount of the curl gel, air dry. sometimes i use a hair towel. bonus if anyone could tell me what my curl pattern appears to be!

Ingredient-wise, biotin is widely preferred for its hair-strengthening benefits, followed by collagen and vitamins. The functionality segment is led by skincare support, largely due to the rising interest in anti-aging solutions.

The demand for clean-label, cruelty-free, and plant-based ingredients is also fueling product innovation and attracting ethically conscious consumers. Market Restraints Despite a favorable growth outlook, the market faces some critical restraints. Allergic reactions, adverse side effects, and lack of scientific validation raise safety concerns among consumers. Instances of product recalls and negative publicity can damage brand reputation and deter potential buyers. Furthermore, the subjective nature of beauty outcomes makes it difficult to quantify product efficacy, further amplifying the need for clinical validation. Regulatory complexities also pose hurdles, making market entry challenging for emerging brands. Market Opportunities The growing demand for clean beauty and sustainable formulations presents a significant opportunity for beauty supplement brands. Consumers are increasingly aligning their purchasing behavior with environmental values, showing preference for biodegradable packaging, ethically sourced ingredients, and cruelty-free practices. There is also a rising interest in personalized beauty, with innovations such as DNA-based customization promising tailored supplement solutions. Transparency in ingredient sourcing and manufacturing processes is another emerging trend, with informed consumers seeking brands that offer clear and honest product labeling.

Between constant heat styling and general neglect, I'm not ashamed to admit that I'm someone who tends to pay more attention to my skin than hair. Yes, my hair is thick and full, but it is beyond thirsty and lacks the nourishment necessary to make it look shiny and healthy. Leave-ins, oils, and deep conditioners seem to only work as a temporary fix, and I don't have time (or frankly, the patience) to wait 15 minutes for a hair mask to work its magic. Cue the Briogeo Superfoods Acai + Passionfruit lightweight hydration hair mask, a water-cream hair mask that claims to hydrate strands without weighing them down. Did I mention it does the job in under five minutes? The mask is the latest newcomer to Briogeo's Superfoods line, a collection of products inspired by (and infused with) superfoods that nourish, moisturize, and support healthy hair. While typically ultra-rich hair masks like this one can weigh down fine to medium hair, this one is specifically formulated for these hair types and addresses signs of damage and dehydration without jeopardizing volume. It's made with acai extract to repair sun damage and reduce frizz along with passionfruit oil for shine and moisture. After just one use of this hair mask, I noticed shinier, more hydrated hair, especially at my notoriously frayed ends. My parched hair drinks the formula right up, and what I love most is that it doesn't just make my hair look better for a day — it actually feels healthier even after I heat style it. The scent is also a huge selling point — it smells like a sophisticated bubblegum (Briogeo describes it as sweet and slightly tart with some freshness), and effectively perfumes my entire shower, making for a great sensorial experience. I'm someone who loves voluminous hair (a 90s blowout is my thing), and oftentimes hair masks can leave my hair looking limp and weighed down. Not this one. The mask feels super lightweight, rinses out clean (read: no residue) and somehow still gives me that deep-conditioning effect my hair begs for. I use this in place of conditioner once a week and have noticed that my hair has more moisture, shine and radiance to it. To use, I scoop up a generous amount and apply to the mid-shafts of my hair all way toward the ends, making sure to distribute it evenly. After five minutes, I rinse it out and voilà — gorgeous, healthy, commercial-ready hair. Get it from Amazon for $15+ (available in two sizes)."

mov_EEEB45782FB8E5BCFFB569B9836969DB,2025-07-01 04:05:08,fr,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[fr]Cette histoire a été initialement publiée sur Les médias sociaux aujourd'hui. Pour recevoir des nouvelles et des informations quotidiennes, abonnez-vous à notre journal gratuit Newsletter des médias sociaux aujourd'hui. Tiktok veut vraiment, vraiment que vous achetiez des choses dans l'application, c'est pourquoi elle héberge un flux de promotions de shopping apparemment en cours, avec sa poussée actuelle axée sur les petites entreprises et les options d'achat pour la nourriture dans l'application, qui sera donc suivie d'un autre événement de vente tout au long de juillet. Tout d'abord, au cours de la semaine suivante, Tiktok coure vers Promotion “acheter localement”ce sera “Célébrez les gens, les histoires et les communautés derrière les petites entreprises les plus distinctives d'Amérique. “ Tiktok est super enthousiaste met en évidence sa contribution à l'économie américaineEt attachez-le à sa poussée de shopping plus large, ressemble à un excellent véhicule pour sa poussée pour la conscience des achats prolongés. Comme expliqué par Tiktok: “SHOWNLOGAMYMADE fait partie de notre engagement à soutenir l'impact social par le commerce – cette fois en s'appuyant sur la valeur culturelle et économique des entreprises locales avec des racines régionales profondes. La campagne présentera des vendeurs exceptionnels de petites entreprises de tous les États-Unis, chacun avec un lien unique avec sa propre communauté et un record réussi à succès dans la boutique Tiktok. “ La campagne se concentrera pour la première fois sur Seattle et sur le célèbre marché des poissons de Pike Place, afin de promouvoir l'expansion de Tiktok dans les produits alimentaires à vendre en flux. «Les clients peuvent désormais découvrir et acheter un assortiment croissant de produits frais et surgelés, notamment des articles à pâtisserie, des repas préparés, du fromage et du salami, de la viande et des fruits de la mer et des boissons. Le marché de la pêche – connu pour sa gestion des poissons experts, qui apporte du poisson non pour le théâtre et la base de poisson non pour le théâtre et la base de poisson et la base de poisson et la base de poisson et de théâtre et de base La base du poisson et non pour le théâtre et la base du poisson et non pour le théâtre et la base du poisson et non pour le théâtre et la base des poissons de théâtre et la base du pathogène l'application. Je veux dire, je ne sais pas que j'aurais personnellement voulu commander des fruits de mer sur Tiktok, mais Tiktok dit que cela marque le début d'un coup de pouce national pour mettre en évidence les favoris de la nourriture locale et régionale, “aidant à apporter une dégustation à la maison à travers l'Amérique”. La transition vers la nourriture est logique, conformément à la façon dont Tiktok essaie d'évoluer ses options d'achat de câbles, même si je m'attendais à ce que la livraison de nourriture soit au centre de cet égard, pas de la nourriture. En Chine, la version locale de Tiktok Il propose déjà des services de commande et de livraison de nourritureélargir ses options d'achat dans le stam. En tant que tel, il semblait inévitable que Tiktok ait suivi l'exemple, alors qu'il essaie d'obtenir plus d'argent qui traverse ses circuits. Cependant, vraisemblablement, il existe des limites de livraison importantes sur les commandes de fruits de mer frais. Dans tous les cas, la campagne mettra en évidence davantage d'options d'achat locales dans l'application, dans le but de susciter plus d'intérêt, car Tiktok continue de pousser ses options d'achat sur plusieurs utilisateurs. Sa prochaine poussée des ventes est dans un territoire plus familier, avec Tiktok qui gère également un Événement “Offres pour vous” de 13 jours Du 7 au 19 juillet. «Les acheteurs peuvent trouver une excellente sélection des principales marques nationales telles que Briogeo, par nature de la peau, The Heritage Store, Pacsun, Fenty Beauty, Crocs, Liquid IV, Philips, Et plus. Les clients appropriés peuvent utiliser Ven le paiement pour échanger une remise supplémentaire. “ La promotion se poursuivra devant les ventes d'Amazon, comme moyen de s'accrocher à l'augmentation de l'intérêt de l'acheteur pour la période, Tiktok essayant de se concentrer spécifiquement sur les opportunités d'achat en direct dans l'application. En fait, le lancement de Tiktok est également lancé “Match de match de prix en direct“Programme, qui offrira aux clients qui consultent les offres sélectionnées pour vos jours de dos pour la différence s'ils trouvent un prix plus bas sur la plate-forme sur les produits au premier plan. Le shopping en direct était un autre élément clé de la poussée du shopping de Tiktok en Chine et espère attirer plus d'attention que le public pour cela comptez sur ses entrées aux revenus. Et ces opportunités pourraient être importantes. Génère la version chinoise de Tiktok (appelé “Douyin”) 490 milliards de dollars de ventes de produits bruts (GMV) en 2024une augmentation de 30% sur une base annuelle. Selon les rapports, Tiktok a généré 30 milliards de dollars en GMV en 2024Vous pouvez donc comprendre pourquoi Team Tiktok est de plus en plus désireux de se concentrer sur cet élément. Et bien que les achats dans l'application n'aient pas encore pris les pieds à Tiktok de la même manière, il y a des signes que les utilisateurs de Tiktok Ils s'intéressent de plus en plus à ses options d'achat. Au début de cette année, Tiktok a rapporté Que Les ventes des magasins Tiktok aux États-Unis ont augmenté de 120% par rapport à la même période l'année dernière, tandis que Les marques et les créateurs ont également accueilli plus de 8 millions d'heures de séances de magasinage en direct aux États-Unis Les ventes de petites entreprises américaines dans l'application ont augmenté de 70% sur une base annuelle et, en combinaison, vous pouvez comprendre pourquoi les managers de Tiktok se concentrent toujours sur les signes du dollar tout en recherchant plus de moyens de pousser ses options d'achat intégrées. Il reste à voir si Tiktok deviendra jamais un méga-hub pour faire du shopping, comme il l'a fait en Chine, mais avec des centaines de milliards potentiellement en jeu, vous pouvez parier que Tiktok fera un grand coup. Et vite, comme ça pourrait encore En fin de compte, être interdit aux États-Unis."

1lshmb7,2025-07-05 19:13:39,en,REDDIT,"  I have been dealing with this bs since I was a pre-teen, so like 26 yrs (sheesh time flies!) . In that time I've tried all the dandruff shampoos, all the derm prescriptions, and some specialty products I've come across. For many of these things I thought I'd finally found the solution, but ultimately my invaders would adapt and I'd be back to square one. Most shampoos are just too harsh for my wig 😫, so washing more than once a week is out of the question, periodt. I've also tried some remedies from this sub before, but recently I decided to try some old ideas with a new twist, just for funsies, and uhh, well… my scalp has been completely clear for almost a full 2 weeks, and I haven't applied any additional products in at least 11 days. I honestly don't know if it was one, or some, or all of these things that got me here today, but here's what I did… - Before washing, I sprayed my scalp with a 4:1 mix of water:xylitol (you read that right. The sweetener). I left it in long enough that it dried but I don't think it mattered. Reapplied right before washing too, for good measure. This step was the only thing I've never tried before. *I measured this out in grams btw, because I take ratios seriously - I butchered what was left of my $40 Briogeo Scalp Revival Megastrength shampoo (it wasn't working anymore anyway 🙄) by adding an unmeasured, incalculable amount of additional pure salicylic acid (but honestly not much), mct (c8, c10) oil, and tea tree oil. Lathered it into my hair, let it sit while I showered, rinsed my hair as the very last step. - Dried my hair and put a mix of mct oil, with tea tree and salicylic acid added in, all over my scalp. Again, didn't measure, just followed my heart. *You have to heat the oil to get the salicylic acid to dissolve. Under the hood, here's what each thing does: - If your sebderm is due to excess yeast, xylitol is essentially the first phase of a boss fight where you take down the shield before you can do damage. Xylitol disrupts formation of the biofilm (shield) of the yeast and left it open for a full blown assault by everything else I used. - Salicylic acid affects keratin in the skin, so it helps loosen up any flakes you already have, but it also is supposed to reduce inflammation and itchiness/dryness, and help reduce oil (sebum) production, which yeast feed on. - Tea tree oil is an anti fungal and anti inflammatory, but it's too strong on its own so it needs a carrier oil… - Mct oil is anti fungal, moisturizing, and… a great carrier oil. NOTHING I've tried has allowed me 2 weeks of normalcy without having to do ANYthing extra. Not ever. I haven't added a drop of my oil mix to my hair in about 11 days and I check my scalp every single day. Completely clear. The only thing I don't love is that I don't know if all this is necessary (butchering my shampoo and adding extra salicylic acid to everything), so over time I'm going to cut some corners and see how it goes. I just hope this continues to work"
n1vsdz2,2025-07-07 22:16:35,en,REDDIT,"  Here is my routine in case it helps you. Looks like we have similar hair. I have 2c/3a low porosity, thin hair but a lot of it. I use the JVN Embody volumizing line for shampoo/conditioner, I condition first then shampoo, then rinse everything out. Then I comb in my Briogeo heat protectant curl cream with my bounce curl brush (there's a dupe on amazon). Then I scrunch in Ouidad Whipped Curls conditioning mousse in the gray bottle. Then I rope in and scrunch Redken sculpting curl gel. Then plop for 15-20 mins. I unwrap my hair when it's damp, then diffuse a bit on high heat low flow, then usually I air dry the rest of the way. Then when it's all dry, I scrunch out the crunch with verb ghost oil on my hands. For a refresh (on non wash days since I only wash three times a week), I spray my hair with a continuous water bottle that has several pumps of Bumble and Bumble curl reactivator inside, as well as a small pump of Redken sculpting curl gel, and water. I usually just rake my fingers through a bit and scrunch, but sometimes I have to use my bounce curl brush if my curls are really out of shape. Then I scrunch in a little Ouidad whipped curls mousse mixed with warm water on my hands. Then when it's dry,  I scrunch out the crunch with Verb ghost oil."

mov_5A4DEBA3C3502A1809F4B7D2F8F2EDF7,2025-07-08 12:36:55,en,WEB,"  It's not every day that I'm willingly spend money on beauty products. That is, until Amazon Prime Day rolls around. As a beauty editor, my desk is consistently stacked high with boxes of products vying for a chance to be tried and praised, but few things beat the tubes and jars I've trusted for years. Because I'm a bit spoiled by free products, I find it hard to splash out on my favorites when I'm running low—but when they're slashed by as much as 50% during Prime Day, which runs from July 8 to 11, I'll never hesitate to hit purchase. To access these steep discounts while they last, you'll need to sign up for an Amazon Prime membership, which is free for 30 days before charging a monthly fee. From there, you can reap the benefits of on-sale luxury and drugstore beauty, along with the fashion must-haves, home décor findings, and more that Who What Wear editors have meticulously selected. Below, the Amazon beauty products that I buy on repeat (starting at just $4!) from brands such as Kiehl's, Laneige, Supergoop! , and more—plus a few big-ticket items I'd recommend snagging now that they're on sale. Editor-Approved Beauty Deals Under $30 Dr.Althea 345 Relief Cream Daily Face Moisturizer Of all the facial moisturizers I own, I never travel anywhere without the Dr.Althea 345 Relief Cream. I love this soothing cream for its niacinamide-forward formula, which helps quell my rosacea-induced redness, while hyaluronic acid and ceramides help hydrate the skin and lock in moisture. Plus, its squeeze-tube bottle makes it easily portable, which is why I never hesitate to hit buy when I spot it on sale. Wonderskin Wonder Blading Lip Stain Peel Off Masque I, along with the rest of the Who What Wear beauty team, fell in love with this best-selling viral lip stain from Amazon this year: the Wonderskin Wonder Blading Lip Stain that sent TikTok into a tizzy. All you do is let the dark formula sit for 10 to 30 seconds like a mask (I like to apply it like lip liner) before wiping it off with a damp towel for a tint that lasts for hours. Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Speaking of peeling things off, there's never been a better time to stock up on Hero's original pimple patches than while they're on sale for just $10. These hydrocolloid stickers work overnight to zap zits and whiteheads after just one use—no picking or popping necessary. I keep these patches in my medicine cabinet and pack a sheet in every carry-on for the inevitable travel-induced breakouts. Nécessaire The Body Wash Crowned one of our very favorite bodywashes this year, the Nécessaire The Body Wash is a necessity (get it?) for several reasons. It's made with a vitamin-rich formula that supports hydration, even skin tones, and smoother texture, and its gentle scent doesn't bother any of our beauty editors—even those of us with sensitive skin. Now, you can nab any scent for just $21. Briogeo Style + Treat Yuzu + Plum Oil Sleek Stick I, along with everyone else who favors a bad-hair-day updo, have a lot of love for the sleek, slicked-back bun. However, there were always stray hairs and breakage poking up at my hairline—that is until the Briogeo Sleek Stick came into my life. While other wax sticks at Amazon would take multiple washes to actually get out of my hair, this non-greasy, never-damaging wax offers a smooth, glossy finish that makes my strands feel soft and washes like a breeze, no scrubbing required. Oh, and did I mention it's a Who What Wear Beauty Award winner? Supergoop! Glowscreen SPF 40 I likely need not introduce you to the Supergoop! Glowscreen, but I do need to inform you that it's on sale and ripe for the taking. This radiant, tone-evening sunscreen offers a lit-from-within glow while smoothing your skin into a filter-like veil; its formula is pumped full of SPF 40 and hyaluronic acid for an extra dose of protection. It's not only a favorite tinted sunscreen, but it's a top-notch makeup primer, too. Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara The Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara from Essence was already a steal at just $5 full-price, but at its Prime Day rate, buying a tube almost feels illegal. My fellow beauty editors have waxed poetic about this inexpensive formula for its impressive lengthening and curl-preserving powers, and I've personally bought this tube twice in the past year. No really, you need it. Shop More Editor Recommendations L'Oréal Paris True Match Lumi Glotion..."

n28fcur,2025-07-09 19:38:25,en,REDDIT,"  Your pattern looks similar to mine, I have a mix of 2c and 3a. Here is my routine and products in case it helps you. I have 2c/3a low porosity, thin hair but a lot of it and I live in Florida. I wash at night because I have two kids. I use the Ouidad Advance Climate Control line for shampoo/conditioner, I condition first then shampoo, then rinse everything out. Then I comb in my Briogeo heat protectant curl cream with my bounce curl brush (there's a good dupe on amazon). Then plop for 15-20 mins. I unwrap my hair when it's damp, then diffuse a bit on high heat low flow and then pineapple and sleep on a silk pillowcase. In the morning, I spray my hair with a continuous water bottle that has several pumps of Bumble and Bumble curl reactivator inside, as well as a small pump of Ouidad advance climate control gel, and water. I usually just rake my fingers through a bit and scrunch, but sometimes I have to use my bounce curl brush if my curls are really out of shape. Then I scrunch in Ouidad Whipped Curls conditioning mousse in the gray bottle. If I feel like my curls need it, I use a bit of Ouidad advance climate control gel after. Then when it's all dry, I scrunch out the crunch with verb ghost oil on my hands and use Living proof defrizzer as a finishing spray. ! [img](ddtvl4vtiwbf1)"
mov_19EFB214706F9D35B333BDED0EA4D69C,2025-07-09 19:52:15,en,WEB,"  The best curl creams can really take your hair care routine to the next level. For the uninitiated, these are styling products that are used on coily, curly, and wavy hair types in order to create more defined curls while also addressing issues like frizz and dryness. A good curl defining cream isn't always dependent on what your hair type or curl pattern is—sometimes the best things to look for are hydrating or nourishing ingredients that seal moisture into the hair. My hair, for example, is prone to dryness, and I've noticed that my curls respond a lot better to formulas that contain key ingredients like shea butter and coconut oil. The good news is that there are dozens of options to choose from, and we spent two months incorporating several different types into our regular hair care routines, before narrowing down our favorites to the list ahead. Whether you're looking for a multitasker that hydrates and prevents breakage (like our best overall winner!) or one that perfectly defines waves for your wash and go, there's something here for every hair type and need. The best curl defining creams, at a glance: Best Overall: Pattern Beauty Styling Cream Courtesy of brand Original photo from Paton Hardy testing Pattern Beauty Styling Cream ChevronChevron Pattern Beauty Styling Cream $28 Amazon Key ingredients: Shea butter, cacay oil, almond oil Size: 15 oz. Pros: Defines curls, prevents breakage Cons: Thick and may leave residue on the hair More often than not, curl creams are looked at simply as styling products that only help with defining curly hair, but that's only partly true, since some curl creams can also address frequent issues that people with curly, wavy, and coily hair face like damage and breakage. That's where the Pattern Beauty Styling Cream comes in—it's made with ingredients like shea butter, cacay oil, and almond oil to promote length and moisture retention and to prevent breakage at the ends. So not only will it give type 3 and 4 curls a crazy amount of definition, it puts in even more work to strengthen the hair from the inside out, something not all curl creams claim to do. “The texture for this one was really thick, but it gave my curls nice definition when I applied it,” says Condé Nast Content Licensing Associate, Paton Hardy, who has very fine, curly hair. “After the fact, it was a little drying for me, so I found it best to be used with a hair oil. It also smelled super fresh!” Best Drugstore: SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie Courtesy of brand Original photo from Danielle Jackson testing SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie Original photo from Danielle Jackson testing SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie ChevronChevron SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie $12 $8 (33% off) Amazon Key ingredients: Coconut oil, silk protein Size: 12 oz. Pros: Moisturizes really well, manages frizz, under $20 Cons: It's really thick, so your hair doesn't really absorb it This is an oldie but goodie that's a SheaMoisture bestseller (it was also highly-recommended by people in my immediate friend group when I first went natural in college), and it definitely lives up to the hype. It has ingredients like coconut oil and silk protein, which moisturizes the hair from inside the shaft, and it prevents common curl woes like frizziness. Sometimes I use this cream after washing and blowing out my coily, type 4 curls (I prefer to do twist outs on stretched hair), and even after applying it to my hair in a blown out state, the curls still manage to turn out looking like healthy spirals. I'm also a really big fan of the way this product makes my hair feel—after unraveling my twists, I usually find myself continuously touching my curls because of how satisfied I am with how soft and moisturized my hair feels. My only gripe is that this is a product that sort of sits on your hair—it's pretty thick, so that's to be expected—so if you're someone who touches your hair often, you'll definitely be able to feel that there's something on your strands, though it doesn't leave behind an oily or greasy film.

n2a1wut,2025-07-10 00:34:39,en,REDDIT,"  Thank you! Yes it's low porosity. So on wash day, I wash 3 times a week and wash at night, because I have two kids and works out better for me. I use the Ouidad Advance Climate Control line for shampoo/conditioner, I condition first then shampoo, then rinse everything out. Then I comb in my Briogeo heat protectant curl cream with my bounce curl brush (there's a good dupe on amazon). Then plop for 15-20 mins. I unwrap my hair when it's damp, then diffuse a bit on high heat low flow and then pineapple and sleep on a silk pillowcase. Then I do that refresh I told you about in the morning. I felt like I was wasting product putting it all at night and then my curls were really bad in the mornings and I had to refresh anyways."
