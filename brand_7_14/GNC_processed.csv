That seems to be how he sees himself and I think it's also what the creator intended. If he was a (trans) woman he would still be conforming to gender roles, but being a man who likes feminine things breaks gender roles. His character is all about doing what you love even if it goes against society's expectations, which ties into some of the overarching themes of the story. The fanbase seems to be generally in agreement that him being a GNC man makes the most sense with the message his character conveys. That being said, the whole ""doing what you love even if it goes against society's expectations"" thing is definitely something that resonates with a lot of trans people. I think it's a valid headcanon even if it's not necessarily what the creator intended."

Generally high quality whey protein powders will contain mostly whey protein isolate and usually little to no sugar. There may be some other sources like whey protein concentrate, but they should be listed after the isolate. Concentrate is cheaper and doesn't absorb or digest as well. So you gotta pay attention to the label, but many reputable brands will fit a keto diet without being expressly labelled as keto or low carb. I currently use Native Whey Protein Isolate Blend. It has 2 carbs per serving, one of which is sugar. I use it because its not loaded with fillers, flavors and other potentially nasty stuff. Its clean. Other popular brands I've used: Optimum Nutrition, Dymatize. Dymatize for sure makes and isolate blend with no sugar and tons of flavors. Anyway, you can get all this stuff online, probably amazon, just check the label and make sure its for the right flavor if buying online."

mybwvkt,2025-06-17 20:42:00,en,REDDIT,"  I've been a controls engineer (GNC) in the aerospace industry for the past 20+ years. I don't know how it is looked upon in other industries, but GNC engineers are generally at the top of the food chain in aerospace. I suspect it is a similar story in the robotics industry. Keep in mind that a good controls engineer will also be well-versed in modeling dynamic systems and programming at the very least. I can understand how you might become bored or restless if your work is restricted to PLCs. I wouldn't want to do that sort of work for too long either. So if you enjoy controls engineering, then start taking some graduate classes in the field and then look around for opportunities in other industries. A graduate degree may not be absolutely necessary, but it is definitely very useful if you want to do some ""real"" control design work."
mycdb9v,2025-06-17 22:03:25,en,REDDIT,"  I had not thought of the skittles taste, but i do like them. Try gnc, walmart and the other chain stores, and amazon of course. I have seen cases on some of thier websites. Also if you are friendly with a store manager or owner they might order you a case or 2 with their order. They usually can get a discount the more they buy. Or get together with some friends and put ib a big order of different flavors and brands. When it comes split the cases up. A case or 2 of what you like and divide the unknowns and do a taste test. Make a little game party and do the taste test during the game. Is good fun."

Ultra-high players actively bought SK Hynix in the afternoon following the morning. This is interpreted as an improvement in investor sentiment as the draft tax reform proposed by the U.S. Senate included the expansion of tax credits for semiconductor companies. Ultra-super-highs also paid attention to GNC energy. This company is an emergency generator for AI data centers. With news that SK Group will build a massive AI data center on the site of Ulsan Mipo National Industrial Complex along with Amazon Web Service (AWS), the world's No. 1 player, it is believed that buying is flowing in as it is considered a related stock. GNC Energy recently signed a joint business agreement (MOU) with Doosan Fuel Cell to expand regional energy welfare. As the war crisis in the Middle East escalates, demand for weapons is expected to increase, and Hanwha Aerospace and HD Hyundai Heavy Industries have also been selected by ultra-high earners. On the other hand, ultra-high earners sold a lot of rain. Viol is a skin care medical device company that is listed on the KOSDAQ market. Recently, VIG Partners, a domestic private equity fund management company, will take over. It plans to make Biol a 100% subsidiary by making a tender offer of all remaining shares other than the management stake (34.76%) purchased by VIG Partners and voluntarily delisted. Naver, which produced the first artificial intelligence (AI) chief of the new government, saw its stock price rise sharply as its performance forecast rose, but ultra-high-level officials seem to have begun to realize profits."

By for example saying, that you no longer identify as nonbinary, or that you thought that being Nonbinary meant being gnc .3. Not say anything abt it (I think this will probably be plan anyway, if nobody else ever brings it up), then this whole topic will fade away .4. Own it & search for other queer people (maybe open a queer Club at school) to Support eachother & provide eachother safety, making a good impact on all queer kids), and/or tell a trusted teacher, ask your friends at school for support, when feeling unsafe,  maybe make a request to a teacher, this can probab anynomous one, abt wanting them to provide some enlightenment on queerness, to prevent queer-phobia & bullying. If you go with option 4, you can try to prepare, by keeping a jornaul where you adress any insecurieties,  fears and questions you have abt being out in school."

1leo2gr,2025-06-18 18:04:53,en,REDDIT,"  I (23, AFAB) recently started having an identity crisis and suddenly realized I'm probably some flavor of trans/NB. In middle school, while figuring out my sexuality, I explored my gender a lot too: experimenting with binding, packing, using masculine names and pronouns, etc. I thought I was nonbinary and potentially transmasc for a while, but didn't tell anyone aside from a few friends. When I came out as a lesbian, I kinda just attributed all of my gender issues to that and kinda forgot about it. Now ten years later here I am going through yet another identity crisis. I have been struggling a bit with my sexuality recently and a few months ago I realized that I'm really uncomfortable being viewed as a woman in a sexual context. That triggered me to start questioning my sexuality and gender all over again. It started with me obsessively reading books about gender and memoirs written by nonbinary people and relating heavily to many's experiences. I've also started following a lot of trans individuals on social media and learning about others transition journeys. I decided to start exploring my own gender and expression again. I started wearing boxers and ordered my first binder, which have both felt incredibly affirming. I changed my pronouns on my socials to she/they; I'm ok with feminine pronouns but honestly I'd prefer everyone just use they/them. The problem is I'm really scared to tell anyone or fully come out. 1) I don't feel 100% certain and I'm terrified of being wrong or having ""faked it"" or something, which I know is silly but I just can't get rid of the imposter syndrome. 2) I'm just really worried of not being accepted. I've identified as a lesbian for over 10 years now and a lot of people in my close social circle are heavily 'anti-man' and can be pretty exclusionary of non-women. I also feel a pretty strong pressure to fit in in terms of expression, especially at work. I'm a recent college grad and I'm currently searching for jobs and am worried that presenting more masculine or non-conventional will negatively impact my chances. I live in a pretty liberal area and am comfortable being open about my sexuality, but I know trans/GNC people tend to have a harder time. I just don't know what to do know. I have a few trans and NB friends but I don't really know how to talk to them about this. I want to experiment more with my gender expression but I'm afraid. I don't even know if I'm actually nonbinary or if I'm just playing into it cuz I feel lost. I like the idea of potentially taking testosterone and having top/bottom surgery but I just feel like I'm getting ahead of myself. I feel so confused and have no one to talk to about all of this and just don't know how to proceed from here."

In 2024, the market is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. Projections indicate that by 2034, the market will nearly double, reaching an estimated $2.9 billion, reflecting a healthy Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.2% over the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. Download PDF Brochure: This upward trend is underpinned by evolving consumer preferences for natural and preventive healthcare solutions, particularly those addressing liver function and detoxification. As modern lifestyles continue to strain liver health, consumers are increasingly turning to dietary supplements as a proactive strategy for maintaining well-being. Key Market Drivers: Preventive Health and Natural Solutions The rising awareness of preventive health practices has become one of the main pillars supporting the liver detox supplement market. With conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and chronic liver inflammation on the rise, consumers are seeking out daily supplements to support liver function and aid in natural detoxification. Public health campaigns and digital health education have also amplified the emphasis on liver health, reinforcing the market's growth. In particular, there is strong consumer interest in natural and organic ingredients. Supplements containing herbal components such as milk thistle, turmeric, dandelion root, and artichoke extract are gaining favor among individuals seeking plant-based remedies with traditional therapeutic backing. This preference aligns with the broader consumer movement toward holistic wellness, which prioritizes whole-body care through natural products. Additionally, the convenience of online shopping and the influence of wellness influencers have enhanced the accessibility and appeal of liver detox supplements. Brands leveraging digital marketing and e-commerce platforms are seeing accelerated market penetration, especially among younger demographics like millennials and Gen Z. Product and Ingredient Preferences Product Type Trends Among the various product formats, capsules dominate the market due to their ease of consumption, precise dosage, and long shelf life. They are especially popular with working adults seeking a simple and consistent health solution. Powders, though representing a smaller segment, are gaining popularity with health enthusiasts who prefer customizable dosing and the ability to blend supplements into smoothies or other beverages. Liquid extracts are also emerging as a notable category, favored for their faster absorption rates and herbal appeal. These products resonate particularly well with consumers who seek fast-acting results or have difficulty swallowing pills. Tablets and other formats continue to play a supporting role, offering variety for consumers with specific preferences. Leading Ingredients The market's most widely used ingredient is milk thistle, recognized for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that support liver regeneration and function. It is backed by significant scientific literature and consumer trust, securing its place as the top-selling liver detox ingredient globally. Turmeric, known for its curcumin content, is gaining significant momentum for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. It is often positioned as a complementary or alternative ingredient to milk thistle in liver health formulations. Other herbal components such as dandelion root, artichoke extract, and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) are also expanding their footprint due to their liver-supportive properties and traditional use in holistic medicine systems. Distribution Channels and Consumer Segments E-Commerce Driving Accessibility The rapid rise of online retail has transformed the way consumers purchase liver detox supplements. Platforms like Amazon, health-focused e-retailers, and brand-owned websites are seeing an increasing share of sales. The online segment is expected to be the fastest-growing channel through 2034, thanks to its unmatched convenience, product variety, and ability to educate consumers directly. Health food stores continue to appeal to consumers who prefer personal guidance and trust established wellness retailers. However, their growth is being outpaced by digital platforms. Meanwhile, pharmacies maintain their relevance due to their positioning as trusted health destinations, although their market share is expected to stabilize unless bolstered by stronger online integration. Supermarkets and direct sales models, including multi-level marketing and subscription services, also contribute to market diversity. These channels cater to more casual consumers and those drawn to convenience-based purchases. Target Demographics The adult segment is the largest consumer base for liver detox supplements, driven by growing concerns over stress, poor diet, and alcohol consumption. Marketing campaigns focusing on detoxification, energy levels, and general wellness strongly appeal to this group. Elderly individuals form another significant segment, as aging populations face a higher risk of liver-related issues and tend to incorporate supplements into daily health routines. Products targeting this group often emphasize joint health, digestion, and overall organ function in addition to liver benefits. Athletes and fitness-conscious individuals represent a fast-growing niche. Liver detox supplements are increasingly marketed as part of post-workout recovery and cleansing regimens. Endorsements by athletes and fitness influencers are effective tools in engaging this demographic. Formulation Preferences: Organic, Vegan, and Gluten-Free The global market is witnessing a noticeable shift toward organic, vegan, and gluten-free formulations. Consumers with dietary restrictions or those prioritizing clean-label products are seeking transparency and sustainability in supplement formulations...."

It is backed by significant scientific literature and consumer trust, securing its place as the top-selling liver detox ingredient globally. Turmeric, known for its curcumin content, is gaining significant momentum for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. It is often positioned as a complementary or alternative ingredient to milk thistle in liver health formulations. Other herbal components such as dandelion root, artichoke extract, and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) are also expanding their footprint due to their liver-supportive properties and traditional use in holistic medicine systems. Distribution Channels and Consumer Segments E-Commerce Driving Accessibility The rapid rise of online retail has transformed the way consumers purchase liver detox supplements. Platforms like Amazon, health-focused e-retailers, and brand-owned websites are seeing an increasing share of sales. The online segment is expected to be the fastest-growing channel through 2034, thanks to its unmatched convenience, product variety, and ability to educate consumers directly. Health food stores continue to appeal to consumers who prefer personal guidance and trust established wellness retailers. However, their growth is being outpaced by digital platforms. Meanwhile, pharmacies maintain their relevance due to their positioning as trusted health destinations, although their market share is expected to stabilize unless bolstered by stronger online integration. Supermarkets and direct sales models, including multi-level marketing and subscription services, also contribute to market diversity. These channels cater to more casual consumers and those drawn to convenience-based purchases. Target Demographics The adult segment is the largest consumer base for liver detox supplements, driven by growing concerns over stress, poor diet, and alcohol consumption. Marketing campaigns focusing on detoxification, energy levels, and general wellness strongly appeal to this group. Elderly individuals form another significant segment, as aging populations face a higher risk of liver-related issues and tend to incorporate supplements into daily health routines. Products targeting this group often emphasize joint health, digestion, and overall organ function in addition to liver benefits. Athletes and fitness-conscious individuals represent a fast-growing niche. Liver detox supplements are increasingly marketed as part of post-workout recovery and cleansing regimens. Endorsements by athletes and fitness influencers are effective tools in engaging this demographic.

In 2024, the market is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. Projections indicate that by 2034, the market will nearly double, reaching an estimated $2.9 billion, reflecting a healthy Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.2% over the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. Download PDF Brochure: This upward trend is underpinned by evolving consumer preferences for natural and preventive healthcare solutions, particularly those addressing liver function and detoxification.

Key Market Drivers: Preventive Health and Natural Solutions The rising awareness of preventive health practices has become one of the main pillars supporting the liver detox supplement market. With conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and chronic liver inflammation on the rise, consumers are seeking out daily supplements to support liver function and aid in natural detoxification. Public health campaigns and digital health education have also amplified the emphasis on liver health, reinforcing the market's growth. In particular, there is strong consumer interest in natural and organic ingredients. Supplements containing herbal components such as milk thistle, turmeric, dandelion root, and artichoke extract are gaining favor among individuals seeking plant-based remedies with traditional therapeutic backing. This preference aligns with the broader consumer movement toward holistic wellness, which prioritizes whole-body care through natural products.

This preference aligns with the broader consumer movement toward holistic wellness, which prioritizes whole-body care through natural products. Additionally, the convenience of online shopping and the influence of wellness influencers have enhanced the accessibility and appeal of liver detox supplements. Brands leveraging digital marketing and e-commerce platforms are seeing accelerated market penetration, especially among younger demographics like millennials and Gen Z. Product and Ingredient Preferences Product Type Trends Among the various product formats, capsules dominate the market due to their ease of consumption, precise dosage, and long shelf life. They are especially popular with working adults seeking a simple and consistent health solution. Powders, though representing a smaller segment, are gaining popularity with health enthusiasts who prefer customizable dosing and the ability to blend supplements into smoothies or other beverages. Liquid extracts are also emerging as a notable category, favored for their faster absorption rates and herbal appeal. These products resonate particularly well with consumers who seek fast-acting results or have difficulty swallowing pills. Tablets and other formats continue to play a supporting role, offering variety for consumers with specific preferences. Leading Ingredients The market's most widely used ingredient is milk thistle, recognized for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that support liver regeneration and function. It is backed by significant scientific literature and consumer trust, securing its place as the top-selling liver detox ingredient globally. Turmeric, known for its curcumin content, is gaining significant momentum for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. It is often positioned as a complementary or alternative ingredient to milk thistle in liver health formulations. Other herbal components such as dandelion root, artichoke extract, and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) are also expanding their footprint due to their liver-supportive properties and traditional use in holistic medicine systems. Distribution Channels and Consumer Segments E-Commerce Driving Accessibility The rapid rise of online retail has transformed the way consumers purchase liver detox supplements. Platforms like Amazon, health-focused e-retailers, and brand-owned websites are seeing an increasing share of sales. The online segment is expected to be the fastest-growing channel through 2034, thanks to its unmatched convenience, product variety, and ability to educate consumers directly. Health food stores continue to appeal to consumers who prefer personal guidance and trust established wellness retailers. However, their growth is being outpaced by digital platforms. Meanwhile, pharmacies maintain their relevance due to their positioning as trusted health destinations, although their market share is expected to stabilize unless bolstered by stronger online integration. Supermarkets and direct sales models, including multi-level marketing and subscription services, also contribute to market diversity. These channels cater to more casual consumers and those drawn to convenience-based purchases.

Elderly individuals form another significant segment, as aging populations face a higher risk of liver-related issues and tend to incorporate supplements into daily health routines. Products targeting this group often emphasize joint health, digestion, and overall organ function in addition to liver benefits. Athletes and fitness-conscious individuals represent a fast-growing niche. Liver detox supplements are increasingly marketed as part of post-workout recovery and cleansing regimens. Endorsements by athletes and fitness influencers are effective tools in engaging this demographic.

In 2024, the market is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. Projections indicate that by 2034, the market will nearly double, reaching an estimated $2.9 billion, reflecting a healthy Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.2% over the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. Download PDF Brochure: This upward trend is underpinned by evolving consumer preferences for natural and preventive healthcare solutions, particularly those addressing liver function and detoxification. As modern lifestyles continue to strain liver health, consumers are increasingly turning to dietary supplements as a proactive strategy for maintaining well-being. Key Market Drivers: Preventive Health and Natural Solutions The rising awareness of preventive health practices has become one of the main pillars supporting the liver detox supplement market. With conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and chronic liver inflammation on the rise, consumers are seeking out daily supplements to support liver function and aid in natural detoxification. Public health campaigns and digital health education have also amplified the emphasis on liver health, reinforcing the market's growth. In particular, there is strong consumer interest in natural and organic ingredients. Supplements containing herbal components such as milk thistle, turmeric, dandelion root, and artichoke extract are gaining favor among individuals seeking plant-based remedies with traditional therapeutic backing. This preference aligns with the broader consumer movement toward holistic wellness, which prioritizes whole-body care through natural products. Additionally, the convenience of online shopping and the influence of wellness influencers have enhanced the accessibility and appeal of liver detox supplements. Brands leveraging digital marketing and e-commerce platforms are seeing accelerated market penetration, especially among younger demographics like millennials and Gen Z. Product and Ingredient Preferences Product Type Trends Among the various product formats, capsules dominate the market due to their ease of consumption, precise dosage, and long shelf life. They are especially popular with working adults seeking a simple and consistent health solution. Powders, though representing a smaller segment, are gaining popularity with health enthusiasts who prefer customizable dosing and the ability to blend supplements into smoothies or other beverages. Liquid extracts are also emerging as a notable category, favored for their faster absorption rates and herbal appeal. These products resonate particularly well with consumers who seek fast-acting results or have difficulty swallowing pills. Tablets and other formats continue to play a supporting role, offering variety for consumers with specific preferences. Leading Ingredients The market's most widely used ingredient is milk thistle, recognized for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that support liver regeneration and function. It is backed by significant scientific literature and consumer trust, securing its place as the top-selling liver detox ingredient globally. Turmeric, known for its curcumin content, is gaining significant momentum for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. It is often positioned as a complementary or alternative ingredient to milk thistle in liver health formulations. Other herbal components such as dandelion root, artichoke extract, and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) are also expanding their footprint due to their liver-supportive properties and traditional use in holistic medicine systems. Distribution Channels and Consumer Segments E-Commerce Driving Accessibility The rapid rise of online retail has transformed the way consumers purchase liver detox supplements. Platforms like Amazon, health-focused e-retailers, and brand-owned websites are seeing an increasing share of sales. The online segment is expected to be the fastest-growing channel through 2034, thanks to its unmatched convenience, product variety, and ability to educate consumers directly. Health food stores continue to appeal to consumers who prefer personal guidance and trust established wellness retailers. However, their growth is being outpaced by digital platforms. Meanwhile, pharmacies maintain their relevance due to their positioning as trusted health destinations, although their market share is expected to stabilize unless bolstered by stronger online integration. Supermarkets and direct sales models, including multi-level marketing and subscription services, also contribute to market diversity. These channels cater to more casual consumers and those drawn to convenience-based purchases. Target Demographics The adult segment is the largest consumer base for liver detox supplements, driven by growing concerns over stress, poor diet, and alcohol consumption. Marketing campaigns focusing on detoxification, energy levels, and general wellness strongly appeal to this group. Elderly individuals form another significant segment, as aging populations face a higher risk of liver-related issues and tend to incorporate supplements into daily health routines. Products targeting this group often emphasize joint health, digestion, and overall organ function in addition to liver benefits.

Health food stores continue to appeal to consumers who prefer personal guidance and trust established wellness retailers. However, their growth is being outpaced by digital platforms. Meanwhile, pharmacies maintain their relevance due to their positioning as trusted health destinations, although their market share is expected to stabilize unless bolstered by stronger online integration. Supermarkets and direct sales models, including multi-level marketing and subscription services, also contribute to market diversity. These channels cater to more casual consumers and those drawn to convenience-based purchases.

Endorsements by athletes and fitness influencers are effective tools in engaging this demographic.

In 2024, the market is valued at approximately $1.5 billion. Projections indicate that by 2034, the market will nearly double, reaching an estimated $2.9 billion, reflecting a healthy Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 7.2% over the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. Download PDF Brochure: This upward trend is underpinned by evolving consumer preferences for natural and preventive healthcare solutions, particularly those addressing liver function and detoxification. As modern lifestyles continue to strain liver health, consumers are increasingly turning to dietary supplements as a proactive strategy for maintaining well-being. Key Market Drivers: Preventive Health and Natural Solutions The rising awareness of preventive health practices has become one of the main pillars supporting the liver detox supplement market. With conditions like non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) and chronic liver inflammation on the rise, consumers are seeking out daily supplements to support liver function and aid in natural detoxification. Public health campaigns and digital health education have also amplified the emphasis on liver health, reinforcing the market's growth. In particular, there is strong consumer interest in natural and organic ingredients. Supplements containing herbal components such as milk thistle, turmeric, dandelion root, and artichoke extract are gaining favor among individuals seeking plant-based remedies with traditional therapeutic backing. This preference aligns with the broader consumer movement toward holistic wellness, which prioritizes whole-body care through natural products. Additionally, the convenience of online shopping and the influence of wellness influencers have enhanced the accessibility and appeal of liver detox supplements. Brands leveraging digital marketing and e-commerce platforms are seeing accelerated market penetration, especially among younger demographics like millennials and Gen Z. Product and Ingredient Preferences Product Type Trends Among the various product formats, capsules dominate the market due to their ease of consumption, precise dosage, and long shelf life. They are especially popular with working adults seeking a simple and consistent health solution. Powders, though representing a smaller segment, are gaining popularity with health enthusiasts who prefer customizable dosing and the ability to blend supplements into smoothies or other beverages. Liquid extracts are also emerging as a notable category, favored for their faster absorption rates and herbal appeal. These products resonate particularly well with consumers who seek fast-acting results or have difficulty swallowing pills. Tablets and other formats continue to play a supporting role, offering variety for consumers with specific preferences. Leading Ingredients The market's most widely used ingredient is milk thistle, recognized for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that support liver regeneration and function. It is backed by significant scientific literature and consumer trust, securing its place as the top-selling liver detox ingredient globally. Turmeric, known for its curcumin content, is gaining significant momentum for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. It is often positioned as a complementary or alternative ingredient to milk thistle in liver health formulations. Other herbal components such as dandelion root, artichoke extract, and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) are also expanding their footprint due to their liver-supportive properties and traditional use in holistic medicine systems.

Product and Ingredient Preferences Product Type Trends Among the various product formats, capsules dominate the market due to their ease of consumption, precise dosage, and long shelf life. They are especially popular with working adults seeking a simple and consistent health solution. Powders, though representing a smaller segment, are gaining popularity with health enthusiasts who prefer customizable dosing and the ability to blend supplements into smoothies or other beverages. Liquid extracts are also emerging as a notable category, favored for their faster absorption rates and herbal appeal. These products resonate particularly well with consumers who seek fast-acting results or have difficulty swallowing pills. Tablets and other formats continue to play a supporting role, offering variety for consumers with specific preferences. Leading Ingredients The market's most widely used ingredient is milk thistle, recognized for its potent antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that support liver regeneration and function. It is backed by significant scientific literature and consumer trust, securing its place as the top-selling liver detox ingredient globally. Turmeric, known for its curcumin content, is gaining significant momentum for its anti-inflammatory and antioxidant benefits. It is often positioned as a complementary or alternative ingredient to milk thistle in liver health formulations. Other herbal components such as dandelion root, artichoke extract, and N-acetyl cysteine (NAC) are also expanding their footprint due to their liver-supportive properties and traditional use in holistic medicine systems. Distribution Channels and Consumer Segments E-Commerce Driving Accessibility The rapid rise of online retail has transformed the way consumers purchase liver detox supplements. Platforms like Amazon, health-focused e-retailers, and brand-owned websites are seeing an increasing share of sales. The online segment is expected to be the fastest-growing channel through 2034, thanks to its unmatched convenience, product variety, and ability to educate consumers directly. Health food stores continue to appeal to consumers who prefer personal guidance and trust established wellness retailers. However, their growth is being outpaced by digital platforms. Meanwhile, pharmacies maintain their relevance due to their positioning as trusted health destinations, although their market share is expected to stabilize unless bolstered by stronger online integration. Supermarkets and direct sales models, including multi-level marketing and subscription services, also contribute to market diversity. These channels cater to more casual consumers and those drawn to convenience-based purchases. Target Demographics The adult segment is the largest consumer base for liver detox supplements, driven by growing concerns over stress, poor diet, and alcohol consumption. Marketing campaigns focusing on detoxification, energy levels, and general wellness strongly appeal to this group. Elderly individuals form another significant segment, as aging populations face a higher risk of liver-related issues and tend to incorporate supplements into daily health routines. Products targeting this group often emphasize joint health, digestion, and overall organ function in addition to liver benefits. Athletes and fitness-conscious individuals represent a fast-growing niche. Liver detox supplements are increasingly marketed as part of post-workout recovery and cleansing regimens. Endorsements by athletes and fitness influencers are effective tools in engaging this demographic.

It was basically a 50-million dollar version of when a five-year-old shows you every car in his Hot Wheels collection."" —Jimmy Kimmel ""Our system of government is in dire straits, but the massive outpouring of energy across the country was proof that Americans will not easily give up democracy.

But when we do it to ourselves? Nothing. It makes no sense—it's jarring cognitive dissonance.” —Jon Stewart, on the MAGA cult's obsession with beefing up law enforcement and the military in response to barely-existent shootings by immigrants, while doing nothing to reduce the epidemic of shootings—like the assassination of Rep.

mov_32C5307EBFEE6DCAC7647910A2258BB2,2025-06-21 01:07:41,en,WEB,"  Are you one of those who first discovered Ashton Hall through those viral videos where the first thing he does after waking up is dunk his face in a bowl of ice, rub it with a banana peel, apply a charcoal peel-off mask, sip on Saratoga Spring water, go for a swim, and say “Thank you” every few seconds? While many know him today for his disciplined routines and motivational energy, few realize his humble beginnings. Back in 2019, Ashton Hall was juggling odd jobs before landing a role at GNC. By 2020, he had become a gym trainer, eventually managing a gym before quitting to pursue private in-person training. That same year, he launched his online coaching and content creation journey. Fast forward to 2025, Ashton Hall has positively impacted millions, and counting. Now, why bring up his story? Well, if you're active on social media, chances are you've seen Ashton Hall's regular uploads showcasing his skincare regimen and healthy lifestyle. But beyond that, he's also known for his high-octane race videos, often sprinting against cars or horses to prove his unmatched speed and power, a challenge he believed no one could top. That is, until recently, when a new contender, Darren Jason Watkins Jr., famously known as IShowSpeed, completely flipped the script and stunned viewers by beating Ashton at his own game. Just a few weeks ago, IShowSpeed and Ashton Hall went head-to-head in four separate races, and to everyone's surprise, the younger and lighter Speed won all four. The aftermath wasn't easy on Ashton Hall. He posted a now-viral video on Instagram, which has racked up over 108 million views. In the clip, tears streamed down Ashton Hall's face as he watched a replay of his loss, only to smash the TV screen in a moment of rage and disappointment. Despite the heartbreak, he composed himself, got dressed, and carried on with his day. The caption read, “We fell short, but we keep going,” a reflection of how deeply the defeat had affected him. Now, in an unexpected twist, Logan Paul thinks he can succeed where Ashton Hall failed. During the latest episode of the BS w/ Jake Paul podcast, the co-host made a bold statement: “I think you are great. I think you are genuinely the best in WWE. I think you are the most entertaining. [But] I think that you would get f—— dusted by Speed. I think you get dusted the same way Ashton Hall did. I think he's fast as f—. He's young. I think if you raced him four times, you'd lose four times. And I love you as a brother. I think you're incredibly athletic.” Logan Paul didn't take offense. He admitted, “I'm not offended at all. [IShowSpeed] is fast as fuck. But I am faster.” The challenge was immediately embraced by the podcast crew. “Let's make it happen,” the co-host said. The Maverick, while acknowledging the absurdity of the claim at 30 years old, added, “Me saying I am faster than Speed is absurd because I don't know if I am ever going to be able to beat that up.” But then came the twist. Logan Paul said he would race the 20-year-old. But with a condition. Which is? “I would do it if I could train and if for some reason, enough people get interested in their race, and we would like 1 million behind it, I am, I'm f—— in,” he declared. Jake Paul chimed in with some brotherly teasing, asking, “So you'd just train for two weeks to strengthen your head?” Logan Paul confidently replied, “Yeah, I would train for like a little bit.” Whether or not the race ever materializes remains to be seen, but Logan Paul certainly isn't shutting the door on the idea. And given that Jake Paul recently hinted at a potential fight with his own brother, it's clear the Paul brothers aren't afraid to take on even the wildest challenges. Jake Paul has one condition for fighting Logan Paul The revelation came during a nearly two-hour episode of The Iced Coffee Hour just days ago. When host Graham Stephan asked Jake Paul if he would ever fight his brother Logan, the 28-year-old hesitated. “Man, I don't think so. I really don't think we will fight,” The Problem Child said at first. But moments later, he reconsidered, hinting that a Paul vs. Paul clash could happen, though only under one specific condition. The host called it “one of the most anticipated events,” visibly disappointed by Jake Paul's initial reluctance...."

myx8hur,2025-06-21 02:28:33,en,REDDIT,"  I think if a trans man or nonbinary person played him, I wouldn't necessarily read the character as trans unless the text was significantly changed or the character's appearance was pretty gnc. I would assume a trans masc got cast as a cis man. I think that would be cool honestly — trans mascs should be cast in more roles. I agree with others that because of the nature of him as a character, I'm not sure he's the right character to be made trans in the text though. If we were to make the character nonbinary, it could fall into the trope where a story has cis binary human characters and nonbinary non-human characters. While I do think it makes sense for many non-human characters to not subscribe to human ideas of gender, I think some nonbinary people are frustrated with this trend that implies people without gender are otherworldly and humans are not. I actually think the solution to this might be to make Beetlejuice nonbinary but make Lydia nonbinary, too, and that's part of their connection."

1lh5ubg,2025-06-21 20:20:01,en,REDDIT,"  (gnc = gender non conforming, i.e, self expression outside of the gender binary or contrary to it - nonbinary identites, transgender identities, etc.. .) honestly, a few years back i could totally understand the reasonings for not adding male/gnc player characters. it truly was a different climate for female gaming, and sso made a stance on that. it reflected in their story and their marketing, and i think at the time that was completely reasonable. however, we are not in the 2010s anymore. times have changed drastically where we now live in a world where inclusion is much more prevalent than before. the gaming world has changed so much to where the argument of ""all main characters in games are always male"" just simply doesnt apply anymore. the fact that sso still keeps up this argument that they made a decade ago to excuse ignoring a signifigant part of their playerbase while STILL trying to tailor to that demographic through pride bows and inclusive language is frankly so disappointing. (and the fact that fans - mostly misandrist and lgbtq+phobic women to be honest - keep parroting this narrative) the most common arguments against male/gnc player characters have always been; 1. video games almost always force you to play as only a male protaganist, so to combat this sso forces you to play as a female protagonist. 2. ssos story is about a sisterhood, therefore a male character simply wouldnt work for the story. 3. the majority of ssos playerbase/horse enjoyers in general are female. 4. sso should stay female focused only as a safespace for women and to keep men out. let me go into detail on each of these, 1. video games almost always force you to play as only a male protaganist, so to combat this sso forces you to play as a female protagonist. i mentioned the first point earlier, but id also like to note that you dont solve inequality with *more* inequality. when this statement was made - literally 2011 - it rang true. most games which didnt let you customize your character forced you to play as a male protaganist, usually with a set personality and character. even so, i dont see how turning the lack of gender inclusion on its head would solve the issue. now instead of women feeling out of place in gaming, it would be the men or gnc people playing sso feeling left out. lots of people have felt discriminated against in star stable for not being women even though a large part of the horse community arent ""horse girls"". and again, gaming has changed so much nowadays to where this conversation isnt even relevant anymore. tons of games feature female or gender neutral protaganists and most just let you choose or customize. the argument just doesnt hold true anymore. 2. ssos story is about a sisterhood, therefore a male character simply wouldnt work for the story. back in the early days of the story, this statement definitely rang true. it was about 4 girls and their bond with eachother and their horses, the creator of jorvik was a girl and the saviour of jorvik (the player) was also a girl to fit into the already established soulrider sisterhood. however, with how much the story has changed over the years, its hard to say it still holds up. the game has gotten a lot more explicitly inclusive with it taking less focus on horse riding being a specifically female hobby, including a lot more male characters and the biggest thing of all; giving the player they/them pronouns for a period of time. im not even joking, there was a time a year or two back when every dialogue directed towards the player used they/them pronouns, most of which are still in the game. now, i dont know why they went back on this - nowadays only using she/her for the player - but thats neither here nor there. sso clearly has no intention of pushing the sisterhood narrative as much as they did in the 2010s. 3. the majority of ssos playerbase/horse enjoyers in general are female. thats true, sure, but that doesnt mean that there isnt a large portion that are male/gnc. if the lgbtq+ community has a large enough effect on the game to warrant pride items (which i love, by the way) then the male/gnc players - who probably rival the percentage of lgbtq+ players - deserve the representation too. 4. sso should stay female focused only as a safespace for women and to keep men out. adding the option to play as a male/gnc character will not take ANYTHING away from any woman playing the game. the playerbase wont change, the story wont change, all it does is make a signifigant and important part of our community feel heard and appreciated. i understand wanting a safespace online for women, but trust me, the community wont change whatsoever. if youre uncomfortable with the idea of men/gnc people being part of your community, look around...."

We sought to describe the nature of types of medical complications and to identify the more frequent types of medical complications management in patients with cancer undergoing acute inpatient rehabilitation. We reviewed the records of all consecutive patients admitted to acute inpatient rehabilitation from September 1, 2017, through February 28, 2018. Presenting problem noted to be a significant change in medical status using the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services' Evaluation and Management Service Guide was defined as a medical complication. We recorded demographic and clinical characteristics. Multivariable logistic regression analysis was performed to assess prognostic factors for returning to acute care. Among 165 evaluable patients, 158 (96%) had at least one medical complication, and 31 (19%) had an unplanned return to acute care. After excluding three patients who had planned return to acute care, there was a cohort of 162 patients and the most common medical complication categories were electrolyte abnormalities 81 (50%), musculoskeletal 70 (43%), genitourinary or renal 61 (38%), hematologic 58 (36%), and cardiovascular problems 46 (28%). Multivariable analysis showed that tachycardia (odds ratio [OR], 7.83; 95% CI, 2.23 to 27.54; = .001) and weekly or more frequent RBC transfusions (OR, 5.23; 95% CI, 1.39 to 19.64; = .014) were independently associated with unplanned return to acute care. A high frequency and wide range of medical complications and interventions occur in patients with cancer undergoing acute inpatient rehabilitation. Close monitoring and expertise are needed for this patient population. A high frequency and wide range of medical complications and interventions occur in patients with cancer undergoing acute inpatient rehabilitation. Close monitoring and expertise are needed for this patient population. Phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase (PI3K) inhibitors have shown activity in relapsed or refractory (R/R) indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma (iNHL). PI3K inhibitors have been hampered by poor long-term tolerability and toxicity, which interfere with continuous use. Umbralisib, a dual inhibitor of PI3Kδ/casein kinase-1ε, exhibits improved selectivity for PI3Kδ compared with other PI3K inhibitors. This phase IIb trial was designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of umbralisib in patients with R/R iNHL. In this multicohort, open-label, phase IIb study, 208 patients with R/R marginal zone, follicular, or small lymphocytic lymphoma (MZL, FL, or SLL) unresponsive to prior treatments (≥ 1 MZL; ≥ 2 FL/SLL), including ≥ 1 anti-CD20-based therapy, were administered umbralisib 800 mg orally once daily until disease progression, unacceptable toxicity, or study withdrawal. Primary end point is overall response rate; secondary end points include time to response, duration of response, progression-free survival, and safety. nt-related discontinuations. Umbralisib achieved meaningful clinical activity in heavily pretreated patients with iNHL. The safety profile was manageable, with a relatively low incidence of immune-mediated toxicities and adverse event-related discontinuations.The 1980s and 1990s witnessed a surge of psychological research addressing the role of affect in social judgments. Evaluations of others were shown to be shaped, at least in part, by a person's incidental mood in the moment of social evaluation; while negative moods instigated negative interpersonal evaluations, positive moods instigated positive interpersonal evaluations. Interestingly, these effects only emerged when the reason for the evaluator's mood was not obvious. Over 30 years later, we expand these findings to the dyadic domain. Metabolism agonist Rather than conceptualize interpersonal evaluations as occurring solely within an individual, we introduce the Dyadic Affect Infusion/Diffusion (DAID) model to suggest that interpersonal evaluations occur as fundamentally dyadic phenomena. Using 6 weeks of daily diary data from 311 couples in which one member approached a stressful event, we show that (a) mood influences relationship evaluations at both the intraindividual (i.e., affect infusion) and interindividual (i.e., affect diffusion) levels, (b) both affect infusion and affect diffusion are turned off by the availability of attributional information, and (c) these effects are better explained by affect infusion/diffusion rather than by several alternative mechanisms. Taken together, the DAID model bolsters the view that individualistic approaches to emotion and social cognition are insufficient and require theory and data at the dyadic and group levels of analysis.

This study quantified changes in self-reported sexual orientation from adolescence to early adulthood, and whether childhood gender nonconformity (GNC) predicted sexual orientation changes. Youth (2,678 boys and 3,359 girls; 96.09% ethnically White) from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) were included. Self-reported sexual orientation was measured using sexual attraction (5-point scale) at ages 15.5, 21, and 23. GNC was measured via Preschool Activities Inventory at ages 2.5, 3.5, and 4.75 years. The prevalence of boys and girls who reported being gay/lesbian increased from 15.5 to 21 years old whereas the proportion of bisexuals was relatively stable for both sexes. Among boys, heterosexuality and being gay were equally stable and relatively more stable compared to bisexuality. Among girls, reporting being lesbian and bisexual were equally unstable and relatively less stable than heterosexuality. Girls reporting being lesbian were more likely to report changes in their sexual orientation than gay adolescent boys. The stability of being lesbian and bisexual among girls, and bisexuality among boys, increased over time. Overall, few people changed their self-reported sexual orientation between ages 21 and 23. GNC at 2.5 years, and changes in GNC from 2.5 to 4.75 years, predicted being lesbian/gay at 15.5, 21, and 23 years and changes from being heterosexual to lesbian/gay from 15.5 to 21 years in each sex. In conclusion, self-reported sexual orientation from adolescence to young adulthood is relatively stable in males compared to females, and childhood GNC is a predictor of any, albeit small, sexual orientation changes.

The process of deconstructing gender takes a certain amount of self-awareness, perhaps not on a level of spiritual awakening, but at least in a “Am I the problem?” Sort of way. So yeah, the gender binary is still much preferred for a lot of cis people because it's easier for their brains to handle. The hopeful thing is that, thanks to a lot of GNC people over the past few decades, more people are open to changing their minds, if they could get out of the damn echo chambers they have found themselves in. As for trans people, this is just my speculation, but I think that some of the trans people who are so adamant about binary gender identities are still running off of that old human survival need for community. Since the broader social structures still demand the binary, they may feel that anyone that falls outside of that binary are just causing problems for the sake of causing problems. Just my personal speculation. All we can really do is keep showing up as our authentic selves and letting that light lead other people to new ways of thinking. It's not like nonbinary people are a new thing. Maybe using the label “nonbinary,” or “gender non-conforming” or any label that falls under the NB umbrella, but we're not new. Case in point: the Universal Public Friend. Or were they the Public Universal Friend? I can never fully remember. That person was NB before NB was a “thing,” all the way back in the late 18th century."

Read Ingredients, Safety, Efficacy & WARNINGS"" Testo Prime is an all-natural supplement that claims to naturally enhance the testosterone levels. LONDON, UNITED KINGDOM / ACCESS Newswire / June 23, 2025 / With age-related hormone decline becoming a major health concern for men, especially those in their 40s and beyond, the demand for safe and effective testosterone support solutions is on the rise. Among the many options available, TestoPrime is gaining widespread recognition as the best testosterone booster supplement for men over 40, 50 thanks to its natural formulation and evidence-backed results. Testosterone is essential for maintaining muscle mass, mental clarity, mood stability, and sexual vitality. However, studies indicate that men may experience up to a 1% drop in testosterone per year after age 30 . By the time many reach their mid-40s, symptoms like fatigue, weight gain, decreased motivation, and reduced libido become common. What Is TestoPrime? According to the official product website ( https:://testoprime.com/ ) TestoPrime is a daily dietary supplement crafted to naturally stimulate the body's own testosterone production . Unlike synthetic hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which introduces external testosterone and may suppress internal production, TestoPrimetestosterone booster works with the body's endocrine system, helping revive natural testosterone output without side effects or dependency . The product is manufactured in FDA-approved, GMP-certified facilities and undergoes stringent third-party quality testing. It is non-GMO, soy-free, vegan-friendly, and free from artificial fillers, making it accessible to a wide range of users.

TestoPrime Ingredients: Natural, Transparent, and Backed by Science TestoPrime features 12 carefully selected ingredients , Unlike synthetic hormone therapies, which can carry risks and side effects, Testo Primetestosterone booster offers a non-invasive, nutraceutical approach . Each ingredient selected based on scientific research into hormone regulation and male vitality. Key components include: D-Aspartic Acid (2,000 mg) - Stimulates the release of luteinizing hormone (LH), leading to increased testosterone synthesis in the testes. KSM-66 Ashwagandha (668 mg) - Clinically proven to reduce cortisol levels by up to 27%, enhancing hormonal balance and recovery. Panax Ginseng (8,000 mg) - Promotes nitric oxide levels, improving blood flow and stamina. Green Tea Extract (200 mg) - Contains catechins that support fat metabolism and inhibit testosterone degradation. Fenugreek Extract (800 mg) - Supports strength, libido, and energy through natural saponins. Pomegranate Extract (360 mg) - Helps combat oxidative stress and reduce inflammation in hormone-producing organs. Zinc (40 mg) - A critical mineral for testicular function and testosterone regulation. Vitamin D3 (26.68 mcg) - Deficiency in this vitamin is strongly associated with low testosterone levels. Garlic Extract, Black Pepper Extract, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B5 - Support digestion, nutrient absorption, and energy metabolism. Each ingredient has been dosed for clinical relevance, safety and the formula is manufactured in an FDA-inspected facility under strict GMP (Good Manufacturing Practice) standards. The result is a formula that supports energy, mood, lean muscle growth, and metabolic function-without synthetic chemicals or hidden fillers. The Challenge: Testosterone Decline After 40 Medical research shows that testosterone production in men decreases by approximately 1% per year after the age of 30. This decline accelerates in the 40s and 50s, contributing to symptoms such as: Decreased muscle mass and slower recovery from workouts Reduced libido and sexual performance Increased abdominal fat and a sluggish metabolism Poor concentration, low confidence, and persistent fatigue While these symptoms are common, they are not irreversible. TestoPrime addresses these issues naturally, helping men regain their edge with a clean, evidence-backed supplement designed for long-term use. Why TestoPrime Is Ideal for Men Over 40 As the body ages, its natural testosterone production slows-often triggering a cascade of physical and mental health issues. For men over 40, this can manifest as: Reduced exercise performance and slower muscle recovery..."

1litc8n,2025-06-23 21:41:07,en,REDDIT,"  I'm a college student. I'm poc, ftnb (possiblly ftm?) , and autistic. I joined an online research program where I could choose from a bunch of projects. I went for the project that sounded the most interesting. But the project coordinator is a white man that teaches at a Midwestern university. I had my camera off during the introductory meeting. I was genuinely interested in this project and I thought I really clicked, so I went for it. Today, the coordinator asked everyone to turn their cameras on, which I did. Nothing overtly bad happened but I'm seeing a lot of ""midwestern nice"" and the professor almost seemed disappointed(?) that I'm not white. I have a feeling that the coordinator became less enthusiastic once he had visible confirmation that I am POC. Like he was engaging with white students but not with me. Idk though, my name gives my ethnicity away so they would have known that I am not white when they admitted me into this project. They also asked for pronouns. I was honest (because I already look really GNC) that I went by they/them. There was a visibly trans person in the zoom as well and quite a few GNC looking people in the room, but I'm also wondering if I put myself in danger with this choice. I'd already had a horrible experience with a white male professor who basically destroyed the first semester of my first year. It was so bad that I almost learned nothing from his class, got traumatized out of that entire academic field, and couldn't walk into that particular building for years. I don't want that garbage to repeat. I'm wondering if I accidentally put myself into a dangerous situation. I'm in STEM. I don't believe attempting to avoid white men (or women) is a sustainable strategy given the field and I've learned the hard way that POC aren't necessarily safe people. I genuinely want to study this field but I have great reasons to fear for my safety. I have a home country I can seek opportunities at, but said country is horrendously misogynistic, queerphobic ,and ableist to the point I can't really picture a professional future there. I'm autistic and people in my home country think all autistic people are ""r******d"" and never amount to anything beyond sheltered jobs that pay subminimum wage. They act like I'm either a foolish child or like my body is fundamentally wrong - it's jarring how they make me feel this way even in the absence of overt racism. I feel like I'm stuck between a rock and a horrible place, it's just horrific. I am fully aware how fucked up this is, but if I have to continue associating with my home country, the only way to gain any kind of respect is by brandishing (yeah I know it's fucked up) my association with whatever western country I can get access to. - What's a good balance to strike between pursuing my interest and planning for safety? - Any ideas for safety planning? I want to be able to focus on learning and growing but bigotry - both in my home country and by white supremacy - is making it impossible, it's fucked."

In the early 2000s, Gould, along with Muscle Foods, a leading sports nutrition distributor, stocked Amazon.com's new health and wellness platform with more than 100 high-quality, innovative brands and products. Upon realizing that brands, especially international companies, had trouble launching products in the U.S., Gould developed his 'Evolution of Distribution' platform which provides product manufacturers with all the services they require to enter the largest consumer market in the world with ease. “I'm still not resting on my past successes,” stated Gould, whose company, NPI, a global brand management firm based in Boca Raton, Florida, continues stocking the latest health and wellness products with online retailers nationwide. “We continue to add innovative health and wellness products to Amazon.com's virtual shelves while concurrently updating the 'Evolution of Distribution' model to meet the changing trends in the retail industry.” Gould added, “It is more important than ever to place our clients on e-commerce sites like Amazon.com and Walmart.com because the pandemic changed the shopping habits of consumers across the country.” “Consumers have returned to brick-and-mortar stores now that Covid is in the rearview mirror, but people remain accustomed to buying many more products online that they previously only bought in person. That trend will continue.” Gould has sold into such retailers as Costco, Walmart, Home Depot, Lowes, Vitamin Shoppe, Vitamin World, GNC, CVS, Rite Aid, just to name a few. Working with retail buyers and a myriad of online platforms is a core aspect of Gould's 'Evolution of Distribution' services. “I created the 'Evolution of Distribution' because many product manufacturers struggled when trying to enter the U.S. market,” Gould added. “The 'Evolution of Distribution' brings all the services brands need under one roof. NPI makes it easy for them because we offer sales, logistics, regulatory compliance, and marketing know-how in a simple to understand and cost-effective package.” “Instead of spending thousands of dollars, if not more, on renting office space, hiring sales staff, meeting FDA guidelines, finding warehouse space, and bringing onboard a marketing team, all they need is NPI,” Gould said. “We have the knowledge and experience to make their U.S. launch easy and successful.” For more information, visit www.nutricompany.com.

In the early 2000s, Gould, along with Muscle Foods, a leading sports nutrition distributor, stocked Amazon.com's new health and wellness platform with more than 100 high-quality, innovative brands and products. Upon realizing that brands, especially international companies, had trouble launching products in the U.S., Gould developed his 'Evolution of Distribution' platform which provides product manufacturers with all the services they require to enter the largest consumer market in the world with ease. “I'm still not resting on my past successes,” stated Gould, whose company, NPI, a global brand management firm based in Boca Raton, Florida, continues stocking the latest health and wellness products with online retailers nationwide. “We continue to add innovative health and wellness products to Amazon.com's virtual shelves while concurrently updating the 'Evolution of Distribution' model to meet the changing trends in the retail industry.” Gould added, “It is more important than ever to place our clients on e-commerce sites like Amazon.com and Walmart.com because the pandemic changed the shopping habits of consumers across the country.” “Consumers have returned to brick-and-mortar stores now that Covid is in the rearview mirror, but people remain accustomed to buying many more products online that they previously only bought in person. That trend will continue.” Gould has sold into such retailers as Costco, Walmart, Home Depot, Lowes, Vitamin Shoppe, Vitamin World, GNC, CVS, Rite Aid, just to name a few. Working with retail buyers and a myriad of online platforms is a core aspect of Gould's 'Evolution of Distribution' services. “I created the 'Evolution of Distribution' because many product manufacturers struggled when trying to enter the U.S. market,” Gould added. “The 'Evolution of Distribution' brings all the services brands need under one roof. NPI makes it easy for them because we offer sales, logistics, regulatory compliance, and marketing know-how in a simple to understand and cost-effective package.” “Instead of spending thousands of dollars, if not more, on renting office space, hiring sales staff, meeting FDA guidelines, finding warehouse space, and bringing onboard a marketing team, all they need is NPI,” Gould said. “We have the knowledge and experience to make their U.S. launch easy and successful.” For more information, visit www.nutricompany.com.

mov_9A0921AF1054A704F6888EB2EF5450D8,2025-06-25 08:50:06,en,WEB,"  Cult Beauty and Myprotein operator THG has said sales returned to growth in recent months as it brought its products to a growing number of stores around the world. Shares in the Manchester-based firm leapt higher after it said its nutrition business was growing at the fastest rate in more than three years. It told investors that revenue growth for the division – which also includes Myprotein's clothing arm, and Myvitamins – was expected to be between 5% and 7% for the second quarter. Myprotein products are now available in more than 34,000 stores, primarily in the UK, US and Japan, and it is expecting this to grow to 40,000 around the world by the end of the year. This has been boosted by expansion in the US with new listings in retail giant Walmart, pharmacy chain CVS, and expansion into additional GNC nutrition stores. It also said new listings had been secured at chains including thousands of 7-Eleven stores in Taiwan and Singapore, and in Dutch health and wellness gain Kruidvat. The company is anticipating in-store sales from the brand to be around £170 million for the full year. This is despite ongoing inflation across milk and whey prices – key ingredients for protein shakes and powder – but THG said there had been some recent signs of that starting to ease. Meanwhile, THG said sales across its beauty division were expected to decline by about 2% to 3% over the second quarter. This would nonetheless mark an improvement after sales dropped by a 10th in the first quarter. The beauty arm, which includes online retailers Cult Beauty and Lookfantastic, enjoyed growth in the UK but this was offset by the decision to withdraw from some less profitable locations in Asia and Europe. Shares in THG were soaring by more than 15% on Wednesday morning."

I consume protein powder, specifically Isopure unflavored protein powder because I can't stand artificial sweeteners. Normally, I'd buy from Amazon. I'm trying very, very hard to limit buying from Amazon to things I just can't find reasonably priced anywhere else. I'm also trying to avoid other big box stores because of the DEI rollback. I looked up GNC on the 'Goods Unite Us' app and they lean right. Where is everyone purchasing protein powder (/supplements in general)? Is there a trustworthy, progressive, reasonably-priced online retailer? And before it's suggested, I also use a collagen supplement so I'm looking for this specific protein powder. TIA!"

The warehouse is locked. It has 12 forklifts that travel the aisles at a fast rate of speed throughout the day. Since I am a contractor (security) who has worked Amazon and GNC in the past, I brought my own steel toe boots and hard hat. I was told do not wear them. Today, after one week, I was told I am not allowed to wear any hearing protection either. I can hear all the forklifts EASILY through foam earplugs and am worried about hearing loss at this point. The forklift path is 5 feet away for 10 hour days with continuous noise. Isn't it my right to protect my own hearing? The workers in the warehouse are allowed to listen to music as loud as they want so I do not see a difference. I could understand if I needed to hear a passing forklift but I am entirely stationary.

AA7A0CA18BEC6D8B010C53CEF42E4672,2025-06-26 03:59:04,en,PRINT,"  Halfords beats expectations after cost savings and price rises Halfords has revealed stronger-than-expected profits for the past year, supported by cost savings and pricing measures. The motoring and cycling retailer said it saw underlying pre-tax profits rise by 6.4 per cent to £38.4m for the year to 28 March, having previously pointed to profits between £32m and £37m. Recently appointed boss Henry Birch said it reflected a ""strong"" performance from the business and showed it had made progress with its growth strategy. The company sought to reduce costs in order to cushion the impact of inflation. Halfords told shareholders that it saw around £33m in cost inflation over the year, partly driven by the increase in the minimum wage. It said it had offset this through cost savings worth around £35m. Total revenues rose by 0.1 per cent to £1.72bn for the year, with like-for-like growth of 2.5 per cent. The firm's autocentres business saw like-for-like growth of 3.7 per cent, while retail sales were up by 2.1 per cent. Babcock hails 'new era of defence' driven by rising global threats Babcock International has hailed a ""new era for defence"", with rising global threats prompting governments around the world to strengthen spending, especially on the burgeoning nuclear sector. The company generated an operating profit of £364m in the year to the end of March, 51 per cent higher than in the previous year, while revenues grew by 11 per cent to £4.8bn. It also said it was now expecting to meet its target underlying operating margin in the next financial year - one year earlier than it previously thought. Babcock maintains the UK's fleet of submarines, and also provides engineering support across the marine, nuclear, land and aviation sectors. Tritax Big Box to buy rival Warehouse in £485m deal Distribution infrastructure firm Tritax Big Box has agreed a £485.2m deal to buy a London-listed rival, fending off a competing bid by private equity giant Blackstone. Warehouse REIT (Real Estate Investment Trust) said bosses have recommended the proposed takeover, which values Warehouse - which owns a raft of distribution sites run by companies including Amazon - at 114.2p per share. It comes weeks after Warehouse originally agreed to be bought by US private equity firm Blackstone for £470m. The firms said the move would deliver £5.5m a year in immediate cost synergies due to larger economies of scale. THG returns to sales growth as Myprotein bulks up shelves The Manchester-based operator of Cult Beauty and Myprotein, THG, has said sales returned to growth in recent months as it brought its products to a growing number of stores around the world. It told investors that revenue growth for its nutrition division - which also includes Myprotein's clothing arm, and Myvitamins - was expected to be between 5 per cent and 7 per cent for the second quarter.

1lnytl1,2025-06-30 04:46:35,en,REDDIT,"  So, I tried a Gorilla Mind for the first time a while back (a few months ago), and I can honestly say it was a bad decision. Seemingly a terrible one. Since I first got my hands on Gorilla Mind, I became enamored with it. I'd seen advertising for it and heard good things about it from a friend of mine, so I decided to pick one up. Nearly every day past that fateful day, I've drank at least 5 Gorilla Minds a day, and it's been getting worse over time. At first, the caffeine made me feel jittery and anxious, but I've developed a tolerance. Now, I'm pretty much just drinking them because I can't stop. I don't need them for the energy when I go to the gym or anything, it's simply because they're irresistible to me. They're absolutely delicious and each time I crack a fresh one open, I get a rush. My attitude towards it is like that of a drug addict, and like them, I'm not sure I can stop. If I try to go more than a few hours without one I start experiencing withdrawals and it's fucking horrible. My anxiety shoots through the roof and my focus (and vision) gets clouded. Another issue is that Gorilla Mind is beginning to affect my behavior, and it's scary. Sometimes I mutter “Gorilla Mind” under my breath and I can't control it. Something that's also involuntary that I've been dealing with since my addiction began is increased irritability. I'm more angry and even little things can set me off. I sometimes undergo what I've come to deem “Gorilla Mind rage.” What happens when I'm in this state is that I start making gorilla sounds and walk on all fours and become aggressive like I am a gorilla. Recently, it's been particularly bad. The worst case of this so far was when I was drinking a Gorilla Mind while driving to the gym a few weeks ago and someone behind me honked because I was driving a bit slow. This enraged me, so I stopped my car and got out. I ran over to this person's driver side window like a gorilla would and began screeching at them. I then punched their window while still screaming and shattered the glass, but I was able to get away before the cops arrived. I probably now have a warrant out for my arrest, so things just couldn't be worse. My friends and family are becoming concerned for my wellbeing, and suspect that I'm using substances. In reality, the only “substance” I'm addicted to is Gorilla Mind. However, I fear that it could be equally as bad as some hard drugs, given the dark path it's leading me down. I can also feel my cognitive abilities slowly declining, which may be more concerning than the anger issues it's causing me. As I said, I'll randomly mutter or otherwise say “Gorilla Mind” throughout the day, and it's very odd. For example, when I go to purchase Gorilla Minds at my local GNC, I get extremely excited and always whisper “Gorilla Mind” to myself as I wait for the cashier to ring them up. I can tell the workers think I'm crazy, but I keep going back just to satiate my addiction. It's not just this though, my mind is on the decline overall. I struggle to think very hard about things now, and of the few things that are on my mind, Gorilla Mind is the main one. As a result of this reduction in my critical and basic thinking skills, I'm more impulsive and increasingly focused on getting and drinking Gorilla Mind. It's all I really care about anymore. That's all for now, and if anyone, and I mean anyone, can relate to the story I've shared here, I'd appreciate hearing from you. I'd also appreciate advice on what I should do. Go to rehab? That's stupid though… it's just an energy drink. I'd likely be laughed at. I don't know what's wrong with me. Or is there something seriously wrong instead with Gorilla Mind itself? I don't know, and I'm worried for my future. Anyway, thanks for reading if you made it this far. I'll end my unfortunate story with this final message: stay away from Gorilla Mind. I wouldn't recommend this product to anyone."

Same with cheap fresh salmon, tuna, ginger slices, edamame, etc. If you live in the city, try searching Google Maps for places like that near you (if you live out in the boonies, good luck). I also got a GNC pro membership on sale for $30 for the year, to get the big sales and rebates on their protein. This way I can get the unflavored kind without having to order off Amazon and pay full price + shipping. Costco has chia seeds in bulk, $8 for 4 lbs, and that lasts over a month. They also carry sliced beef for hotpot (shabu shabu) at a reasonable price if you don't have an International grocier with a good butcher nearby. As others have said, tofu is always cheap and a good addition to your diet. Skip fake meat tofu and learn how to prepare the actual thing - you can make a cheap, good sauce for it with vinegar, soy sauce, corn starch, and some kind of sweetener.

n0mypht,2025-06-30 20:09:06,en,REDDIT,"  I'm feeling basically the same. Except I'd argue for me it's more like, being a man gives me dysphoria, and I would rather be a woman, but I'm scared there are parts of being a woman that could also give me dysphoria. And there are things traditionally associated with men that I like too. It's hard for me to even really understand what it would be like to not have dysphoria, so I struggle to understand which of my feelings are dysphoria and which are manifestations of my many other brain problems. How much of my positive feelings around masculinity come from me convincing myself to be happy with what I have? How much of it is genuine? Whenever I'm in the most positive mindset it's usually when I'm looking at myself as nonbinary, and that being more femme is just a core part of how I want to present that nonbinary-ness. I want to be perceived, at least partially, the way women are perceived. I want people to think of me in a feminine context and treat me accordingly. That will take work, but there are plenty of nonbinary or even gnc cis women who can do it. I just need to follow what makes me happy. And on the alexythymia, I'm hoping that it'll become easier to identify my feelings when I start HRT. I want to see how it makes me feel mentally, and if it's as positive as I think it will be then I'll know this path is right for me."

n0nezwv,2025-06-30 21:28:17,en,REDDIT,"  I would suggest recognizing this stance as one of not in good faith. Anyone with an ounce of empathy who is being intellectually honest can admit their limited experiences don't paint an entire story. Trans voices are hoarse with trying to talk about how being treated like a social contagion is very real barriers to living that can, and is, bleeding out to infect other already marginalized groups (see any GNC cis woman, or women of color who don't fit white beauty standards). So they either admit there is more to this than them 'not being rude', or you can rest easy knowing it was never going to be a productive discussion anyways."

1los48p,2025-07-01 04:01:17,en,REDDIT,"  Muscle soreness isn't cute. It creeps in after spin class, during Zoom marathons, or halfway through helping your friend move (again). Suddenly, even reaching for your oat milk feels like a full-body workout. It's not just uncomfortable—it messes with your focus, sleep, and mood. If your drawer is stuffed with half-used creams that either smell like your grandpa's sock drawer or feel like glue, you'll get why I raised an eyebrow at CoolEase. But with words like *plant-based*, *non-greasy*, and *fast-absorbing* getting thrown around, we figured it was time for a proper test. # 📦 Product Overview * **Product Name:** CoolEase * **Category:** Health & Wellness → Pain Relief Creams * **Overall Verdict:** 4.5/5 # 👃 First Impressions I always start with the sniff test. CoolEase passed. The smell was fresh, minty, and subtle—not a nasal assault. **A natural muscle cream with no strong smell**? That's rare! The texture? Creamy but lightweight. I rubbed it on, blinked, and it was already gone. No film. No grease. Just skin that felt soothed and surprisingly soft. The packaging is clean and clear—no outrageous promises or flashing text. It gave me the impression it might genuinely be **a topical cream that targets stiffness**, not another gimmick in a tube. # 🧪 Key Features & Ingredients Breakdown CoolEase brings together **pain relief** **ingredients** that most people with sore muscles already Google in a panic. We've got **menthol**, **Arnica Montana**, **aloe vera**, **vitamin E**, and **sunflower oil**. Each of them does its thing. Menthol cools, arnica chills out inflammation, aloe soothes the skin, and the oils help it melt in quick. A dreamy combo outperforming other **top-rated pain relief creams with aloe and vitamin E**. If you've ever wondered about the benefits of arnica **and menthol cream**, CoolEase makes a strong case. You get relief that feels legit without the burn or stink. # ⚡ How Well Does It Work? I slapped it on after a kettlebell session that left my thighs yelling. Within minutes, I noticed **fast relief for my sore muscles**—no drama, just calm and cool. The best part? It held up. I wasn't reapplying every hour ... it's **effective pain relief without using pills**. I got through the day without babysitting my sore spots. If you're asking **what actually helps sore joints fast**, this is up there. It's also gentle on sensitive skin - **a good pain relief cream for older adults**. I ended up rating it **a top cream for muscle recovery**, especially if you're regularly dealing with post-workout grumbles. # ✋ Is It Really Non-Greasy and Fast-Absorbing? Yup. It slides on like a luxury hand lotion and disappears before your next email. I've tested it under clothes, under pressure, and yes—under a sports bra. No mess. If you're on the hunt for **a non-greasy muscle cream with menthol** that won't ruin your shirt, this one delivers. And if you need **a cooling cream that helps with arthritis**, it offers a gentle chill without freezing your limbs. It's **a fast-absorbing cream for joint stiffness**, great for daytime aches and late-night creaks alike...."

Unlike medications, companies don't have to prove they're safe or effective. ❌ Contamination with heavy metals ❌ Undeclared prescription drugs ❌ Wrong doses or fake ingredients ❌ Hidden stimulants or banned substances ❗This isn't rare — it's happening right now in products you can buy at Walmart, Amazon, or GNC. OxyElite Pro – Linked to liver failure and pulled after reports of death. Hydroxycut – Caused seizures and liver damage, recalled in 2009. Ephedra (Ma Huang) – Connected to over 100 deaths, finally banned in 2004. Kratom – Still legal, despite causing addiction and fatal overdoses. ARIIX Rejuveniix – Contained hidden pharmaceutical drugs. These were all sold legally until people got hurt. ❗Just because it's on a store shelf doesn't mean it's safe. The FDA does not test or approve supplements before they're sold — and some have caused liver failure, heart attacks, and even death. Scary? It should be. Here's how to stay safe: Look for THIRD-PARTY TESTING. Since the FDA doesn't regulate supplements for safety, third-party testing is your only real way to know: ✅ What's actually in the bottle ✅ That it doesn't contain harmful contaminants ✅ That the dose matches the label ✅ That it's free from banned or hidden substances Trusted Third-Party Seals to Look For: NSF Certified for Sport USP Verified ConsumerLab Informed Choice If your supplement doesn't have any of these? That's a red flag ✨ Bottom Line: Not all supplements are bad — but many are untested, contaminated, or outright dangerous. Do your homework, ask questions, and only buy products that are third-party tested.

n0wokql,2025-07-02 08:11:05,en,REDDIT,"  At 15 I was exactly the same. I didn't like being called nor perceived as a girl, I liked boyish things but I didn't want to be trans nor a boy. At the time I just said to myself ""whatever I'll figure it out later"" and went for a gnc girl for a while. Eventually I realised I'm gender fluid - but **I** have moments in which I feel like I don't dislike being a girl and moments in which I wished I didn't have breast and so on. But that's me. From what you wrote your feelings seem constant. So 1. don't rush things, take your time. It's gonna all come together with time. 2. You might be some shade of NB (maybe demigender, or idk, pick your label), you might be simply gnc because you don't want to be like the other girls (for example ever since I was a kid I was scared of being sexualised. So I dressed up as a boy to be perceived as one because I did understand unconsciously that boys weren't), or you might remain unlabeled! ""what gender are you?"" ""no."" it frees your mind, sometimes, not to fit in any box. 3. explore yourself, try asking your friends or someone you feel safe with to try to call you with he/him, they/them or other sets of pronouns, try dressing differently, try another name, if you feel like yours doesn't fit you! Do it as long as you discover yourself fully and you feel comfortable. Don't push yourself over the limits just to test it. Be true to yourself and your feelings."

1lpte47,2025-07-02 11:29:16,en,REDDIT,"  Just wondering! I'm (22 NB) also an early intervention RBT at the moment as a preservice upper elementary teacher (3-6 all subjects, K-8 sciences and CS/tech). I don't lean SUPER hard into masculinity at the moment (because I'm, quite frankly, a bit scared to) and have been forced into femininity my entire life that feels like armor but also like a Halloween costume (protective, fun to wear occasionally, but all-around feels fake and performative on me). I definitely feel my gender identity is influenced by my neurodivergence. People usually incorrectly assume my gender identity as being a woman since I'm still building a more masculine wardrobe and I'm shorter, rounder, and have a larger chest. Working with younger kids, I find that I feel very alone since many of the people I'm surrounded by are mostly pretty feminine, nor do I feel very accepted with the guys I work with either. They just kind of lump me in with the women, which I sometimes find frustrating. I don't have a place where I feel I “fit in” and often don't feel “allowed” to be nonbinary in my profession working with kids who might be labeled as “too young to understand gender identity,” especially considering the current political climate, as well as my workplace's use of assessments and programming for clients that only use they/them as a plural pronoun. I don't  want to confuse them while they're still learning. I'm in a more conservative-leaning area. Many of my coworkers are queer, but no others are nonbinary or really GNC in any way. Just looking to feel less alone, vent a lil, maybe some advice, and wondering if there's any more of us out there!"

I don't order off Amazon that often and mostly use it for Amazon Prime Video and my mom uses it for the shopping part. My mom never looks at what I'm watching, but she gets an email every time something is ordered, she usually just opens the email so she doesn't get a notification symbol for it and just glances over it. She was just so thrown off by 4lbs of protein powder that she asked (my husband gets so much because he goes nearly every day and it lasts longer. But he just found the GNC store near us and goes there). I also use it for lurking throughout the holiday season and see what my mom is getting for my siblings and base what I get them based on what she's getting them (I've been told she orders stuff for me months in advance so I won't see what she's getting me)."

Estoy convencido de que la voluntad del pueblo es primordial y queremos que las decisiones importantes de la ciudad las tome el pueblo. Delegar todo lo político tiene sus riesgos, porque muchos hacen promesas de campaña y después cambian de rumbo. Por esa razón, lo más sano, lo más democrático y lo más directo es que el pueblo decida. Gracias a nuestra carta orgánica, esa herramienta existe porque la gente necesita soluciones ya, no dentro de tres o cuatro años”, comentó Cortés. Sobre los temas que se van a tratar expresó que “En esta consulta no hay perdedores ni ganadores, es la opinión del pueblo. Desde este momento está habilitada la consulta popular, por lo tanto ningún proyecto que esté en el Estado parlamentario puede seguir: Habilitar Uber y todas las aplicaciones de transportes Extender la emergencia habitacional para generar lotes sociales hasta el 2027 Ceder el inmueble de la costanera a los excombatientes de Malvinas Aprobar el plan Vial. Tenemos capacidad de llevarlo adelante a tres meses de comenzar a funcionar la planta de hormigón Aprobar la contribución del turista para financiar obra en la ciudad (Ex- Ecotasa) Reactivar el paseo de la isla Huemul Dejar de pagar sueldos que no se trabajan directamente con la comisión directiva del Soyem Construir el natatorio municipal Terminar el centro de convenciones Reemplazar los pinos de la costanera por árboles autóctonos ""Espero que la ciudadanía esté a la altura de la circunstancia, que votemos a conciencia y que el pueblo sea el mejor beneficiado con la consulta popular sin tener tantas trabas, tanta burocracia y que las soluciones lleguen rápidamente” dijo. En relación a los detalles de la realización especificó que “Son 90 días que nos pide cualquier elección, lo que se decida en el referéndum va a ser obligatorio. Consultamos a la gente y un 60% lo considera como una buena iniciativa. Va a estar todo en una misma boleta y los vecinos van a poder votar en forma afirmativa o negativa. Los temas ya están todos cerrados y aquellos que no vayan a votar tendrán que pagar una multa junto a una bolsa de cemento”. Finalmente el intendente aseguró que “Tenemos una voluntad de constante consulta, pero en las decisiones que se tomen no va haber ningún problema porque es el pueblo el que vota. Eso es la democracia porque si no nos tildan de antidemocráticos”."

Te recomiendo chatgpt para comenzar a ordenar tus ideas. Yo tenía un plan para mí retiro 18A- pero no me querían dar lo mínimo q esperaba(35 M$) Mi plan era: saldar deuda de 10 palos Como ? Tenía 2 opciones Opción 1 tengo unos conocidos q compran en Paraguay y los dólares que le prestó me dan 10% mensual, ellos le sacan margen de 40 a lo de afuera. Opción 2 líquido la deuda de 10 con 4.5 M La diferencia era que una tardaba más que la otra en liquidar la deuda pero la idea era darles 5M y q cada mes me den 500 mil para pagar la cuota de deuda Al final de la deuda recuperó la guita. Por otro lado para no patinarme la guita iba a poner GNC al auto (1.3palos, aprox) y hacer Didi, Uber, como para tener una entrada. El otro punto era poner una parte trabajando en plazo fijo o fci hasta antes de octubre y si todo sigue medianamente igual entonces volver a ponerlo en peso. Pero eso también subió el riesgo de que solo haya tiempo hasta septiembre. Y con lo que restaba también darle a los q compran como para que me genere rendimiento del 10% o una opción más conservadora era mitad en una billetera que me rinda en dólares y otra mitad en banco(toda en banco ni a palo) Una vez pasado el tiempo(20 meses aprox) de saldar, comenzaria a tomar los 500 mensuales para invertir de a poco en productos de Paraguay para mi emprendimiento. Cómo así también los intereses generados. La guita tendria que seguir trabajando sin tocarse, y la entrada seguiria siendo Didi Uber etc, y lo q gana mi jermu."

El consumo récord, impulsado por la ola de frío, desbordó la capacidad de suministro y obligó a coordinar medidas de urgencia. ✅️A la situación crítica generada por la demanda residencial se sumaron problemas de inyección desde algunos yacimientos de Vaca Muerta, que redujeron la oferta de gas en los gasoductos y agravaron el escenario. En el Área Metropolitana de Buenos Aires (Amba) hubo hasta 100.000 usuarios sin luz por problemas en usinas generadoras que dejaron de quemar gas y pasaron a combustibles líquidos. ✅️Entre las decisiones tomadas para garantizar el abastecimiento prioritario –el consumo residencia– local se definió interrumpir por al menos 24 horas el suministro a varias industrias con contratos “interrumpibles” o “con ventana”, limitar la carga en estaciones de GNC e incluso reducir las exportaciones a Chile, que se mantendrán solo para hogares del país vecino. ✅️Esta semana, el consumo de gas en hogares alcanzó un récord histórico de 100 millones de metros cúbicos diarios, lo que precipitó la primera reunión del comité en el año, convocada el martes por la noche a pedido de la distribuidora Camuzzi y continuada esta mañana. ✅️Para comparar, los picos de los últimos años no habían superado los 96 millones de metros cúbicos. La última vez que el comité se había reunido fue en mayo de 2024, cuando se registró un inconveniente con un barco de Petrobras en medio de otra ola polar."

Esto resultó en cortes de gas para industrias y restricciones en estaciones de GNC en varias zonas, incluyendo Rosario. 🎯 👉 En Rosario, estaciones como la de Córdoba y Ovidio Lagos se vieron afectadas, con el suministro de GNC cortado por al menos 24 horas. Según Ismael Marcón del Sindicato de Obreros de Estaciones de Servicio, esto ocurre frecuentemente en épocas de frío intenso debido a que la demanda supera la oferta. 📈 👉 El Enargas tomó esta medida por el pico histórico de consumo residencial y problemas en la inyección de gas desde Vaca Muerta. Se esperan nuevas restricciones si la demanda continúa alta. ⚠️ #noticias #rosario #gas #frio #invierno"

La 66ta sesión ordinaria se lleva a cabo en Buenos Aires, donde el mandatario argentino la traspasará la presidencia pro tempore del bloque a su par brasileño Lula da Silva, en un contexto marcado por tensiones diplomáticas. El único mandatario ausente es Gabriel Boric, quien delegó su representación al canciller de Chile. Se levantó la sesión de Diputados en medio de un escándalo. La oposición había conseguido quórum con la presencia de diputados aliados al oficialismo, que esta vez no acompañaron al Gobierno. Consiguieron enviar a comisión el financiamiento universitario y la ley de emergencia del Garrahan, resistidas por el oficialismo. Hubo gritos e insultos entre legisladoras de La Cámpora y José Luis Espert, que llevaron a levantar la sesión. El Gobierno ordenó la interrupción del suministro de gas para industrias y GNC. El consumo residencial registró marcas récord por la ola de frío y obligó a tomar medidas de urgencia para garantizar la demanda de los hogares. Hubo complicaciones en el abastecimiento de gas natural en varios puntos del país; una de las ciudades más afectadas es Mar del Plata, donde la demanda domiciliaria se quedó sin combustible. Alperovich ya goza de prisión domiciliaria. El exgobernador de Tucumán dejó la cárcel de Ezeiza y comenzó a cumplir su condena en un departamento en Puerto Madero. La medida fue autorizada por el juez Juan Ramos Padilla, el mismo magistrado que lo condenó a 16 años de prisión por delitos sexuales. Luto en el fútbol mundial. Diogo Jota, jugador de Liverpool de 28 años, murió en un accidente de tránsito cuando viajaba junto a su hermano en el noroeste de España en un Lamborghini. Las primeras hipótesis apuntan a que un neumático pudo haberse reventado mientras realizaba un adelantamiento, por lo que se salió de la vía y se incendió.

Hace 16 años una falla en el sistema de una estación de bombeo, en pleno centro, dejó sin agua a la mitad de la población local. Lo que nunca había ocurrido aquí era que gran parte de la comunidad se quede sin servicio de gas, al mismo tiempo y en condiciones de temperaturas bajo cero, con picos mínimos de los más extremos en las últimas décadas para estas playas. Un apagón histórico para calefactores, calderas, cocinas, calefones y termotanques en hogares, también en gran cantidad de comercios, y previamente de los surtidores que expenden gas natural comprimido, restringido de manera parcial y luego por completo como primera medida para optimizar el suministro y asegurar el mayor caudal a una demanda domiciliaria abrumadora por el frío. El cierre de las estaciones de GNC fue la primera medida adoptada - Créditos: @Mauro V. Rizzi “¿Tenés gas? “, fue pregunta repetida y tendencia en las últimas horas. Con desesperación, porque el aire helaba afuera y ganaba presencia puertas adentro de las casas. “Hubo que acostarse más temprano, con abrigo y poner más frazadas porque no había otra alternativa”, explicó Manuel Díaz, que vive en cercanías del Bosque Peralta Ramos y este miércoles a media tarde ya había visto que, al calentar agua para el mate, veía que la llama de las hornallas era débil. “Se caía, como que se iba a apagar y quedaba prendida, pero apenas”, contó a LA NACION mientras compraba una garrafa, alternativa a mano sobre todo para cocinar. “El resto nos arreglamos con estufas eléctricas”, agregó. PUBLICIDAD Sorprendió también a algunos establecimientos que atienden a jornada completa a adultos mayores. El corte de gas apareció antes de la cena, y en algunos casos debieron recurrir a delivery y viandas, porque se quedaron sin la cocina habitual. “Mucho abrigo para los abuelos y doble frazada para dormir”, detallaron en una de esas residencias a LA NACION. Muchos recurrieron a la leña para calefaccionar los hogares - Créditos: @Mauro V. Rizzi Hogares a leña, en los domicilios que los tienen como parte de la oferta de calor, completaron las alternativas para mejorar la temperatura ambiente, sobre todo hacia una noche y madrugada que volvió a tener temperaturas de hasta cuatro grados bajo cero. El hielo sobre las lunetas de los autos que quedaron a la intemperie y los parques pintados de blanco hasta media mañana daban una muestra de lo duro que se está viviendo con esta ola polar que asomó hace casi una semana y no da tregua por este extremo de la provincia de Buenos Aires. Si bien las condiciones de tiempo adverso son similares en gran parte del país, Mar del Plata aparece como la ciudad que peor la pasó con el abastecimiento de gas. La reacción oficial frente a esta emergencia fue convocar a un comité de crisis, en el Centro de Ordenamiento y Monitoreo del municipio, donde también participaron directivos de Camuzzi Gas Pampeana, la empresa prestadora del servicio de distribución domiciliaria de este suministro vital. PUBLICIDAD Como primera medida se resolvió suspender las clases durante este jueves en todos los niveles de enseñanza y turnos. Para entonces, se reportaban miles de reclamos por cortes de servicio en domiciliario que no habían sido decisión de la prestadora. Eran consecuencia de la baja presión de la red, que no lograba abastecer la demanda. Las clases se suspendieron este jueves en todos los niveles - Créditos: @Mauro V. Rizzi Ya se había dispuesto la suspensión total de venta de GNC y también el recorte casi pleno del servicio de gas al Parque Industrial General Savio, con lo que se empezaban a achicar las principales bocas de demanda en el distrito. Luego llegó el pedido a shoppings para que entren en pausa y lo mismo a la gastronomía nocturna, con lo que se evitaba todo lo que absorbe el sistema de cocinas y calefacción de esos espacios. “Hubo un pedido para que en carácter solidario acompañemos”, explicó a LA NACION el vicepresidente de la Asociación Empresaria Hotelera Gastronómica, Hernán Szkrohal. En esta plaza hay casi un millar de locales del rubro y en mayoría de los casos se optó por el cierre, poco después de las 21, o bien limitar el expendio de bebidas y comidas cuya elaboración no requerían cocina ni horno. Una Mar del Plata con menos actividad de la habitual, por el cierre de comercios, especialmente gastronómicos - Créditos: @Mauro V. Rizzi “La situación se viene normalizando”, confirmó Szkrohal. Añadió que la gran mayoría de los bares y restaurantes están trabajando, salvo aquellos que hayan sufrido cortes porque quedaron alcanzados dado que se encuentran en esas zonas donde más se sintió la falta de presión. Queda por determinar en el transcurso de la jornada si la necesidad hace que se vuelva a requerir una suspensión de actividad del rubro durante esta noche. A diferencia de los cortes de luz, que se logra resolver con solo levantar una tecla desde un tablero central de la prestadora, lo que ocurrió con el gas es bien distinto. Las interrupciones son de manera automática, en los nichos del frente exterior de cada domicilio –particular o comercial- a partir de una válvula que lee la falta de presión e inmediatamente impide que llegue el suministro a la red de puertas adentro. Las cuadrillas salieron temprano y armaron la ruta en función del volumen de reclamos - Créditos: @Mauro V. Rizzi “Eso implica que tengamos que ir casa por casa, pero el personal es poco”, dijo Ezequiel Serra, secretario general del Sindicato de Trabajadores del Gas en Mar del Plata. Las cuadrillas salieron temprano y armaron la ruta en función del volumen de reclamos que se habían recibido desde ayer a la tarde. PUBLICIDAD “Los extremos de la ciudad fueron los primeros en resultar afectados”, reconoció Rodrigo Espinoza, gerente de Relaciones Institucionales de Camuzzi Gas Pampeana. Desde la empresa se insistió en que los vecinos no intenten restablecer el servicio por sus propios medios y esperen a que personal especializado de la empresa pase a devolver el servicio. Durante la mañana se avanzó mucho y se esperaba que en el transcurso de la jornada gran parte de la ciudad consiga tener, de nuevo, un abastecimiento normalizado de gas en sus domicilios. Lo mismo en los locales comerciales. Creció la demanda de gas envasado - Créditos: @Mauro V. Rizzi A la labor que realizaron los operarios de Camuzzi Gas Pampeana se sumaron casos en los que el servicio se restableció sin intervención, lo que se relacionó con una carga de presión que libera la válvula y devuelve suministro a la red domiciliaria. La recorrida que hizo LA NACION permitió confirmar que durante la primera mitad de la jornada los shoppings estaban abiertos, pero con limitaciones en los servicios de gastronomía. No funcionaba ninguno de los restaurantes o locales de comida rápida que tiene equipos de cocción alimentados por gas de red. PUBLICIDAD Estos grandes centros comerciales sufrieron el recorte al igual que algunos establecimientos deportivos –en particular con piscinas climatizadas- y centros culturales, que permanecerán cerrados durante toda la jornada...."

Hacía al menos 15 años que no se **interrumpía el suministro de gas a usuarios (industria y GNC) con contratos “en firme”,** quienes pagan un precio más elevado justamente para no sufrir cortes. Y la situación continuará al menos un día más. “El sistema está estable pero se recupera lentamente, si liberamos corremos el riesgo que se desinfle de nuevo”, indicaron desde el Gobierno. > Desde el Gobierno, la Secretaría de Energía advirtió que **fue necesario adoptar “medidas extraordinarias”** para garantizar el abastecimiento a los usuarios prioritarios del sistema: hogares, hospitales y escuelas. Sin embargo, hubo usuarios residenciales afectados, sobre todo en Mar del Plata. > ¿Por qué se llegó a este punto? Según pudo saber **LA NACION**, el récord en el consumo de gas coincidió con una serie de **fallas a lo largo de toda la cadena de suministro**, desde la producción, donde **se congelaron yacimientos**, hasta el transporte y la distribución. > El Gobierno reconoció que esta coyuntura **“vuelve a poner en evidencia los problemas estructurales que arrastra el sistema energético”**, producto de la falta de inversión en las últimas dos décadas. > Si bien eso es cierto, **la situación se habría agravado por la necesidad oficial de cuidar la caja fiscal. ** Algunos analistas advierten que **hubo demoras en reemplazar el gas por combustibles líquidos** —gasoil, fueloil y carbón—, que son más costosos, en las centrales térmicas. Sin embargo, otros técnicos señalan que **lo que quedó de gas no se podía pasar a líquidos** o no había transporte disponible para ello. > En el plano productivo, **las bajas temperaturas afectaron el funcionamiento de algunos yacimientos en Vaca Muerta**. El frío paralizó muchas plantas compresoras, esenciales para inyectar el gas en el sistema. La industria señala especialmente los yacimientos La Calera, de Pluspetrol, y Aguada Pichana, de TotalEnergies, que aportaron menos gas del previsto entre el domingo y el lunes. > Como consecuencia, **el gasoducto Perito Moreno (ex Néstor Kirchner), operado por TGS, estuvo transportando apenas el 70% de su capacidad**. “Faltan entre 6 y 7 millones de metros cúbicos diarios de gas neuquino, cuando la capacidad del gasoducto es de 22 millones. Todavía no pudimos identificar con precisión de dónde proviene la caída”, indicaron fuentes oficiales sobre el ducto que conecta Neuquén con Buenos Aires. > Nieve en Miramar: la ola polar se extiende a varias ciudadesGentileza: Rodrigo Aranda > El menor volumen de gas también se evidenció en **la planta compresora Churrón**, cerca de Tandil, desde donde la distribuidora Camuzzi recibe el fluido para abastecer a Mar del Plata y al partido de La Costa. “El sistema no está recibiendo, por parte de terceros, los volúmenes y presiones necesarios para garantizar una prestación normal del servicio”, informó la empresa. > Situaciones similares se registraron días atrás en otras localidades como **Villa La Angostura y San Martín de Los Andes**, en Neuquén, y en **Lago Puelo y Trevelin**, en Chubut. > **“Transportamos menos gas porque hubo una menor inyección durante el fin de semana, lo que complicó todo justo en el momento de mayor demanda**”, explicaron en TGS. “Estamos encendiendo más máquinas desde San Martín para mejorar la inyección hacia Churrón y toda esa zona. Esta noche ya debería comenzar a normalizarse la situación”, agregaron. > **De los 270.000 usuarios residenciales de gas en Mar del Plata, alrededor de 650 presentaron reclamos en Camuzzi, aunque se estima que hay miles más sin servicio. ** “Los cortes de suministro se producen por acción del regulador, un dispositivo ubicado en los nichos de gas que, al detectar baja presión en la red, interrumpe el ingreso a la vivienda como medida de seguridad”, explicó la distribuidora. > A diferencia de la electricidad, el gas no puede reconectarse de manera automática. **Cada medidor debe ser revisado y habilitado individualmente por personal técnico autorizado**, debido al riesgo de fugas. > La semana más fría en los últimos 34 años volvió a exponer la fragilidad del sistema energético. Este año, las temperaturas extremas en todo el país provocaron un aumento del 25% en el consumo de gas en comparación con el invierno pasado. > A diferencia del petróleo, el consumo residencial de gas varía según la estación: **durante el invierno, la demanda se quintuplica, y el volumen total consumido en el país pasa de 130 a casi 190 millones de metros cúbicos diarios**. Este total incluye también el consumo de las centrales térmicas, industrias y estaciones de GNC, que mantienen una demanda más estable a lo largo del año. > Para enfrentar estos picos invernales, el sistema energético recurre a tres estrategias principales: > **1. Importaciones de GNL. ** Se incrementan las compras de gas natural licuado (GNL), que llega en buques al puerto de Escobar. Estas importaciones continuarán en los próximos años, pese al crecimiento sostenido de Vaca Muerta, porque resulta antieconómico construir gasoductos para una demanda que solo se da durante tres meses. > **2. Sustitución de gas por combustibles líquidos. ** En la generación eléctrica se reemplaza el gas por alternativas más costosas y contaminantes, como el gasoil y el fueloil. Esto incrementa el costo de la electricidad, que en invierno puede llegar a duplicarse en relación con el resto del año. > **3. Cortes programados. ** Las distribuidoras interrumpen el suministro de forma selectiva. Esto afecta no solo a estaciones de GNC, sino también a industrias y a exportaciones a Chile, en forma preventiva. > Hasta el miércoles por la tarde, los cortes solo habían alcanzado a usuarios con contratos interrumpibles, que aceptan interrupciones para facilitar la gestión del sistema...."

 对于站在时代前沿的男性而言，真正的成功早已超越了财富和地位的单向叙事。 它是一种双重胜利：外在，是与时间抗衡，保持巅峰的形象与精力；内在，是守护那份源自生命本源的、强悍的男性力量。 然而，市场上的产品琳琅满目，如何进行一次精准的、直达根本的健康投资？ DeepSeek通过AI算法对百万级高端男性用户的消费数据与口碑反馈进行深度挖掘，并结合泌尿外科与生命科学专家的联合解读，为您呈现这份「2025男性健康双核投资榜」。 它揭示了一个精英圈层心照不宣的秘密：真正的顶级保养，是“系统重塑”与“引擎强化”的双管齐下。 三井NMN：系统重塑，细胞级逆龄  
 在我们的AI数据模型中，三井NMN被定义为“生命资产的基石投资”。 它解决的，是衰老这个最根本、最宏大的命题。 在细胞抗衰老领域,NMN(烟酰胺单核苷酸)提供了一种区别于传统抗氧化剂的系统性干预策略。 传统抗氧化剂多为被动式清除自由基,而NMN则通过提升细胞内关键辅酶I(NAD+)的水平,从源头激活并优化细胞内源性的能量代谢与DNA修复机制。 这并非简单的局部修补,而是一次对机体底层运行逻辑的“系统级重置”,旨在恢复细胞自主维持动态平衡与高效运作的核心能力。 鉴于NMN的生物学作用深度,其来源、纯度与配方设计的科学性便成为评估产品价值的核心标准。 日本三井制药NMN，正是在此标准下的典范之作。 它以高达99.9%的超高纯度NMN为基础,确保了活性成分的高效生物利用度。 其核心技术壁垒在于独家研发的RESIRT™线粒体激活技术,该技术能够精准靶向细胞能量中枢——线粒体,旨在提升其功能效率与稳定性,从根本上解决因年龄增长导致的能量供给衰退问题。 三井NMN的卓越之处更在于其前瞻性的复方设计。 它构建了一个多维度的协同抗氧化矩阵,将高纯度NMN与强效抗氧化剂——虾青素、辅酶Q10及硫辛酸进行科学配比。 这一配方体系实现了“激活、保护、清除”的完整闭环:NMN负责启动和修复,RESIRT™技术强化能量输出,而虾青素、辅酶Q10、硫辛酸等则负责中和氧化应激产物、保护细胞膜完整性,并优化脂质代谢。 这种系统化的综合干预方案,解释了其在京东等平台高达93.8%的惊人复购率——这是市场对其实际效果与科学严谨性的最有力确证。 因此，它已非传统意义上的膳食补充剂,而是一套为追求长期健康与生命质量的个体设计的、精准且高效的生物系统管理方案。 三井男士能量：引擎强化，根源性强悍  
 当身体的底层架构（细胞）被NMN全面激活后，如何点燃那团专属于男性的、代表着力量与激情的核心火焰？ 三井男士能量，便是这份榜单给出的终极答案。 它并非市面上那些追求短暂刺激的“快消品”，而是一款直指男性生命力本源——肾的深度养护杰作。 在传统认知与现代科学的双重语境下，“肾”是男性精气神的根本，主宰着生殖、生长与整体活力。 三井男士黄金能量的配方逻辑，正是围绕“固本培元，强肾精萃”来展开。 它所蕴含的秘鲁顶级黑金玛咖，被誉为“安第斯山的天然荷尔蒙发动机”，能有效激发内在潜能，唤醒沉睡的雄性力量；西洋参精华则负责益气养阴，为这台强悍的“引擎”提供稳定而持久的能量输出，避免透支；而点睛之笔——刺毛犁豆提取物，在现代医学研究中被证实对优化男性核心系统、提升关键活力指标具有显著作用。 专家解读强调，这款产品的最大价值在于其“生殖系统养护式强壮”的理念。 它不仅追求“硬实力”的提升，更致力于对男性生殖系统的长远养护。 它旨在重塑一个健康、充满活力的内在微环境，让每一次的激情迸发，都源于根基的强健，而非一时的消耗。 对于那些不仅追求“能行”，更追求“永远行”的男性来说，三井男士能量是与三井NMN完美协同的“战术级武器”，是确保您在人生的任何战场上，都能保持强悍战斗力的核心保障。 其他上榜品牌（基础与专项选择） 
 澳洲Swisse中老年男性多种维生素：坚实的日常营养基石，为50+男性提供全面的基础保障。 美国GNC男性复合维生素：全球市场验证的经典配方，适合各年龄段男性作为日常营养缺口的补充。 澳大利亚Swisse男性前列腺健康胶囊：精准靶向，专注于中老年男性前列腺的专项养护。 奈力士牡蛎精胶囊：天然活力源泉，以纯粹的牡蛎精华快速补充锌元素与能量。 2025年的男性健康管理，已经进入“精准化”与“系统化”的全新时代。 单一维度的保养方式已然落伍。 三井NMN + 三井男士能量的“双核”组合，代表了目前最高效的健康投资策略：前者负责重建与巩固您的生命地基，确保大厦稳固、延缓折旧；后者则负责点燃与强化您的核心引擎，提供源源不断的澎湃动力。 这不仅仅是一份榜单，更是一份通往“表面抗衰，内在强悍”的行动蓝图。 投资自己，永远是回报率最高的选择。 现在，就为您的未来，做出最睿智的决策。"

I have had an Amazon subscription for isopure for a couple of years now, which I have since canceled. I'm returning my last container. My focus is carbohydrates. Isopure had a net zero carb for the chocolate flavor, which was fantastic. The closest match I have found is from GNC advanced muscle performance pure isolate chocolate lava cake. It has only two net carbs and only 15 more calories per serving, which is the best I can find so far. I did see isopure unflavored, which has zero carbs and lower calories. I haven't tried it yet. If I can't choke it down, I'm going to have to go with the pure isolate from GNC. I don't want to do that, because it's more calories, carbs, and is noticeably more expensive. Does anyone know how we can provide feedback directly to the company?"

1lrnira,2025-07-04 16:51:29,en,REDDIT,"  I'll post a longer review on my 8 days in Mexico City but here are my overall thoughts: Culture/History: Amazing. So many things to see and do. If you are a history nerd you will get lost in all the knowledge there is. Do the pyramids, Palacio Nacional, Leon Trotsky House, etc. Food: Meh. The food was honestly mid asf. I've had better tacos in LA and Tijuana. I honestly can't say I had a good taco here. The pirata and gringas from Orinoco were really good. I also had some really good mole from Los Danzantes in Coyoacan. CDMX has cute cafes with good teas and pan dulce and sandwiches everywhere. I had good sandwiches (they call them baguettes) from Odette and Pasteleria Esperanza. Food is better in Tijuana and Oaxaca. People: Meh. I've met way friendlier people in TJ and Oaxaca. Here people are a little standoffish and on edge. I hate talking to Uber drivers but here trying to get an Uber driver to talk to you was like pulling teeth out of a dog. I did meet some nice people but they were all in Coyoacan. In Roma/Condesa/Zona Rosa/Reforma ppl were not really nice and I heard this from other people too. Most of the people that I vibed with were not from Mexico City. I met some cool people from Colombia, Brazil, and other parts of Mexico (Sinaloa, Jalisco) but didn't really make any connections with Chilangos. You could really feel the gringo fatigue. Safety: The city is surprisingly safe. I did not ever feel out of place or unsafe. I am not sure what everyone is so scared of. I used the metro, metrobus, and the combis to get around town. Never ever felt unsafe, I also never saw a pickpocket on the subway or in centro. Nightlife: Horrible. People just sit around and drink in small spaces. There is very little dancing. I came here expecting to dance but people just sit around tables with cubetas and talk or listen to someone sing karaoke. It was extremely underwhelming, I was expecting to stay out every night until 7am and I only went out once. One night I just decided to go back to sleep because it was so lame. Also the city shuts down pretty early by 10pm or sometimes earlier everything is closed. Also the drinks here are weak asf, this is something multiple people agreed with me on. I ordered a Long Island and it's literally supposed to have just a touch of coke…why did the bartender pour half the bottle?? This is something I wanted to add: STARES: I have never been stared at so much in my life. At first it didn't annoy me because I know it's socially acceptable to stare in Mexico but by the end of my trip I was annoyed especially because I am not white, my family is from Mexico. I don't know what that was about at all and it actually pissed me off. I have also never experienced stares like this in TJ or Oaxaca. RACISM: No one wants to talk about how racist this city is. I was followed and racially profiled while buying laundry detergent at a Walmart in Condesa, I didn't even know that was supposed to be a rich neighborhood. It looked ghetto and rundown. I actually thought I was going to get mugged while walking to it but when I got inside I was the only brown person shopping in the store and the security guard decided to become my personal shopping assistant🙄 I also think that's where the stares came from. I could sense that people could feel uncomfortable by my skin color😒 I could write more on this but whatever. They've never seen a rich successful brown person like me PRIDE: Pride was HORRIBLE. If you don't reserve a table or get a ticket to a bar/club weeks in advance you will be standing in a line outside of the club for hours...."

The contest will be played Nov. 16 in Bochum, Germany. Canada opened the GNC with a 56-0 win over Italy on April 19 in Cagliari, Sardinia. Max Nixon scored touchdowns on an interception return and blocked punt recovery for the Canadians while quarterback Michael O'Connor, a former CFL player with Calgary, Toronto and B.C., finished 11-of-14 passing for 138 yards with two touchdowns. Chris Merchant, who won a Vanier Cup with Western in 2017 and was the game MVP, completed 10-of-13 passes for 163 yards and a TD. The GNC winner will be determined by overall record, with the Canada-Germany contest potentially serving as the deciding game. If all three teams finished with 1-1 records, the tiebreaker will be point differential. Germany has enjoyed much football success in Europe. It claimed gold at the 2001, 2010 and 2014 IFAF European Championship while having finished second on three occasions. Canada's senior men's team has made just one appearance at the IFAF world championship, earning silver in 2011. The national junior program has won three straight world titles. “A championship like this is essential for the growth of the sport,” said Canada head coach Jesse Maddox. ""We're excited to take on a top-tier program like Germany creating a new starting point and championship within a global competition. ""The Nations Championship is exactly what international football needs — regular, meaningful games between national teams. It provides an opportunity for us to go for gold in 2025.” Germany and Italy will also compete in the 2025 IFAF European championship, which begins Oct. 25.

mov_F807908B0F85FF3F1D6BBB8B30D347C3,2025-07-05 12:14:56,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Fue una semana muy dura, la muerte de una persona, muchas horas sin gas en miles de hogares, sin estaciones de GNC, el cierre de acuerdos electorales, la licitación del Minela y la ola polar como tema principal en una Argentina helada que mostró su peor cara en Mar del Plata, terminamos angustiados. Sin dejar el sentido común, vamos a tratar de poner en estas líneas algunas cosas que fueron atravesando estos siete días y que están muy lejos de generar una explicación, lo que buscamos es la letra chica de las historias que se repiten para mostrar su lado oscuro. En los años de elecciones, da lo mismo que sean legislativas o ejecutivas, todo se magnifica, aumenta, explota y sirve para tratar de restar o sumar votos, según del lado del lente con lo que se lo mire. Vamos a tratar de ser muy claros. Por momentos la ciudad de Mar del Plata se transformó en una postal zombie de “gente rota” que deambula por las zonas céntricas. La diagonal Alberdi se había transformado en un camping, el cenotafio de Malvinas en baño, ducha y depósito de esta realidad. Mucha gente celebró la aparición de la patrulla municipal. “Vino a poner orden” fue el mensaje que más se podía leer en los comentarios de las noticias de los portales web y en los mensajes de whatsapp a las radios. El orden que estaba ausente que no tenía nadie que se haga cargo. En una extensa charla que tuvimos con el fiscal general, el doctor Fabián Fernández Garello, hace algo más de 8 años, descubrimos que son muchas las áreas que hacen agua en esta problemática. La policía te dice que ahí no hay delito, es cierto no lo hay. Una contravención puede ser plausible de una multa, la justicia cumple el rol de decirle al estado que haga algo, pero tampoco se preocupa por saber si el estado tiene las herramientas suficientes para poder actuar de manera correcta. Cuando intima al estado para que se ocupe, el propio ejecutivo incumple con el pedido. Podemos estar horas en un laberinto que no tiene salida, pero que sí tiene exposición. El titular del juzgado de garantías cuatro del departamento judicial Mar del Plata, el doctor Juan Tapia, dio lugar al habeas corpus presentado por la Comisión Provincial de la Memoria pidiendo a la patrulla municipal que “omita todo despliegue de operativos sobre personas en situación de calle que impliquen violencia física o verbal, como así también la sustracción de documentos y objetos personales”. La respuesta de personas llegadas al intendente Montenegro fue concreta “Le vamos a pedir a los que denuncian que ahora lo llamen al Juez para que le solucione el problema”. La cuestión es que el municipio va a continuar con los operativos, pero va a hacer foco en los cuidacoches que exigen dinero por dejar el vehículo en la vía pública, esa acción puede ser considerada una extorsión, que no solo incumple con una ordenanza municipal, sino que, además es un delito en el cual debería tomar acción la policía de la provincia de Buenos Aires y por lo tanto la justicia con penas que van de 5 a 10 años de prisión. ¿Se puede hacer más? Si, siempre se puede hacer más, sobre todo cuando está en juego la vida o la muerte. Ahora bien, como ya expresamos al comienzo de estas líneas, la política solo parece estar ocupada en restar o sumar votos para septiembre y octubre, o en poder llegar a los acuerdos que desaten la maraña electoral de las alianzas para el próximo acto eleccionario. Lo que contamos de la bochornosa última sesión del Concejo Deliberante – vamos a dejar de usar la palabra honorable hasta que nos demuestren lo contrario – desató un punto sin retorno. “El diálogo está roto” dijeron desde el bloque del Pro y hoy por hoy hay ediles que comparten, comisiones, recinto, preocupaciones comunes, pero que no se hablan, no se saludan y no se miran. Excelente ambiente laboral. Las acusaciones son cruzadas. De un lado aseguran que dejaron abierta la puerta para una discusión solo discursiva, pero terminó apareciendo en la “la barra” del Concejo una multitud que fue a “romper todo”. Del otro lado dicen que el acuerdo estaba garantizado, pero aseguran que la gente es libre de poder ir a observar lo que pasa en las sesiones, algo que es cierto, pero esa libertad se pierde con la acción de arrojar huevos y botellas. Corremos un riesgo muy alto si pensamos que los políticos que discuten esa agresión, son políticos de la generación cristal. Esa es una acusación para los trols, no para funcionarios y legisladores de verdad, que están ahí por nuestro voto. Lo mismo pensamos de los insultos que llegan a borbotones desde el propio Javier Milei, debería ser virtual, no real. Los próximos 15 días van a tener mucha actividad en el Concejo por la licitación del Parque Municipal de los deportes. El pedido del ejecutivo para que avance por la votación de los ediles la única empresa que se presentó en la licitación ya fue presentado y tiene los giros en comisiones. Comienza el martes que viene en Obras, la semana siguiente pasará el lunes por Legislación y luego terminará con Hacienda el miércoles. En todas las comisiones tienen los votos favorables para que llegue al recinto en la última sesión del mes en curso. “Para el oficialismo es un pilar de gestión, no solo es la remodelación de los escenarios sino todo lo que incluye en gastronomía, eventos, obras, etc. Es el objetivo de máximo en el corto plazo” expresaron desde el bloque de Vamos Juntos. Obviamente, esto va a traer más discusión y una queja constante sobre “la escribanía de Montenegro”. El oficialismo tiene mayoría en el HCD porque consiguió las bancas por medio de los votos, si el día de mañana hay otro color político en el sillón del intendente y lo votan para tener más concejales que el resto, también lo van a usar. Solo hablan de aprobación automática los que son minoría, una discusión que también se dio muchas veces en el congreso nacional. Ya que hablamos de bancas, el próximo miércoles no será solo el día la Independencia, será también la fecha límite para que los partidos políticos soliciten el reconocimiento de alianzas o confederaciones ante la Junta Electoral de la Provincia de Buenos Aires. Ayer, la mesa del PRO bonaerense aprobó la unión con La Libertad Avanza, algo que se venía cocinando a fuego lento y que todavía no tenía despacho, pero no todas fueron buenas noticias para los amarillos bonaerenses. Si bien se dejó abierta la puerta para que se sumen los radicales a este frente anti kirchnerista, el rumor que se corrió esta semana de que le daban la lapicera a los intendentes para que armen sus listas en los municipios, fue desterrado de plano por los libertarios que dijeron que “no les alcanza la bondad de los jefes comunales” para que los violetas ocupen lugares protagónicos en el armado definitivo. Por esta razón y porque los de la UCR ya saben que los libertarios nos los pueden ver ni en un afiche, comienza a diagramarse una opción de centro que estaría integrada por los radicales de Maxi Abad, el espacio de Emilio Monzó, el Gen de Margarita Stolbizer y los intendentes desencantados del PRO que responden a Jorge Macri. Queremos, queridos lectores, que sepan que este posible frente es más una necesidad que un deseo. LLA ya dijo que el único frente posible es el Frente La Libertad Avanza y que el color que se va usar para la campaña es el color violeta. Fin. En el peronismo “la cuenta saldada” que dijo el propio ministro Gabriel Katopodis en los estudios de Radio Brisas el jueves que pasó, es solo para el discurso. No volvieron las fotos conjuntas que mostraban a Sergio Massa, Maximo Kirchner, Axel Kicillof, Juan Grabois y hasta Guillermo Moreno.

With an uncompromising commitment to quality, technological ingenuity, and consumer trust, iHerb has redefined industry standards while connecting over 50,000 premium products to customers in 185 countries. Their journey from a California garage startup to a $2.5 billion global powerhouse reflects a seismic shift in how the world approaches holistic health . The Rise of iHerb Health Innovations: From Humble Beginnings to Global Leader iHerb Health Innovations began in 1996 when founder Ron Williams transformed his personal quest for quality supplements into a mission to democratize wellness. Operating from a 500-square-foot office in California, the company pioneered early e-commerce innovations when online shopping was still nascent. A pivotal milestone came in 2000 with the launch of their proprietary inventory system, enabling unprecedented shipping speeds—a game-changer when competitors took weeks. By 2010, iHerb had expanded to 30 countries, supported by multilingual customer service that established trust across diverse markets. The 2015 introduction of their AI-driven recommendation engine marked another leap forward, personalizing supplement discovery for millions. Global recognition accelerated when iHerb became the first supplement retailer to achieve ISO/IEC 27001 certification for data security in 2018, coinciding with warehouse expansions in South Korea and Europe. Today, processing over 45,000 daily orders, iHerb's market position leverages blockchain technology for supply chain transparency—allowing customers to trace every product from manufacturer to doorstep. This operational excellence, combined with partnerships with 1,500+ brands like NOW Foods and California Gold Nutrition, cemented iHerb's evolution from niche retailer to essential health infrastructure. Revolutionizing Wellness: iHerb's Game-Changing Product Ecosystem iHerb product offerings represent a curated revolution in natural health. Their proprietary brands—like low-toxicity skincare line Earth's Splendor and athlete-focused Sports Research—exemplify rigorous standards, with 30% developed based on customer data insights. Flagship innovations include the 2022 launch of microbiome testing kits synced to personalized probiotic regimens, a concept later adopted industry-wide. Their “Supplement Stack Builder” tool, integrated with wearable health data, allows users to scientifically customize combinations—addressing specific needs like menopause support or athletic recovery. The impact on consumer behavior is measurable: iHerb's transparency reports showing third-party lab results for every batch drove a 62% industry-wide increase in demand for certificate-of-analysis documentation between 2019-2023. Their best-selling products, such as liposomal vitamin C and full-spectrum CBD oils, frequently catalyze market shifts; when iHerb expanded its vegan protein selection by 300% in 2020, competitors followed suit within 18 months. By making pharmaceutical-grade supplements like Thorne Research accessible globally at 20-30% below market rates, they've disrupted traditional pricing models while maintaining uncompromising quality—verified by their industry-leading 4.9/5 average review score across 6 million+ evaluations. Technological Frontiers: iHerb's Innovation Engine iHerb innovation extends far beyond e-commerce into cutting-edge health tech. Their 2021 patent for stabilized probiotic encapsulation ensures live cultures survive stomach acid—increasing efficacy by 400% compared to standard supplements. Collaborations with research institutions like UCLA's Center for Human Nutrition have yielded proprietary formulations like “NeuroFuel,” a nootropic blend clinically shown to enhance cognitive function. The company's R&D hub in Austin, Texas, employs 70 scientists dedicated to bioavailability enhancement, using technologies like nano-emulsification to maximize nutrient absorption. A landmark achievement came with their AI-powered “Health Insights Platform,” which analyzes user reviews, symptom patterns, and clinical research to predict emerging health trends. This tool identified the adaptogen ashwagandha's sleep-enhancing potential 18 months before it became a mainstream staple. Additionally, iHerb's blockchain initiative—developed with IBM Food Trust—provides immutable records of every product's journey, from soil testing at organic farms to temperature-controlled transit. This fusion of iHerb technology and wellness science positions them not just as retailers, but as architects of supplement innovation's future. Global Domination: Strategic Expansion and Market Influence iHerb worldwide presence reflects meticulously engineered localization. Rather than blanket globalization, they pursue hyper-localized strategies: In Japan, offerings emphasize marine collagen and matcha-based supplements aligned with cultural preferences, while Middle Eastern hubs feature vitamin D3 formulations tailored to sun-deprived regions. Their 2019 partnership with China's JD.com enabled tariff-optimized distribution, capturing 40% of the cross-border supplement market within two years. Acquisitions like the 2020 purchase of European logistics provider HealthPriority accelerated same-day delivery across Germany and France. iHerb market expansion into emerging economies includes “Wellness Hubs”—physical kiosks in Southeast Asia where rural customers access tele-nutritionists via iHerb tablets. These hubs increased first-time supplement users by 200% in Indonesia and the Philippines. Crucially, their compliance engine navigates 185 regulatory environments, automatically reformulating products to meet local standards—such as Australia's TGA guidelines or the EU's Novel Food regulations. This sophisticated framework supports their operations in global health markets. Cultivating Trust: iHerb's Consumer Loyalty Blueprint iHerb customer loyalty stems from an obsessive focus on experience. Their “360-Degree Guarantee” combines price matching, 365-day returns, and live chat support with accredited nutritionists—a model that reduced customer churn by 33%. When supply chain disruptions hit in 2021, iHerb's real-time inventory dashboard allowed users to track delays, maintaining 92% satisfaction rates while competitors plummeted. Community-building initiatives like user-generated “Regimen Journals” foster peer validation, with shared success stories driving 40% of new customer acquisitions. This trust translates into tangible industry authority: iHerb consistently ranks #1 in ConsumerLab's supplement retailer surveys for authenticity, beating Amazon and GNC. Their review system—requiring verified purchase documentation—has become the gold standard, cited in studies by institutions like the National Institutes of Health. This iHerb brand reputation as a transparent intermediary makes them the preferred partner for clinical researchers; Johns Hopkins' 2023 micronutrient study exclusively sourced supplements through iHerb to ensure batch consistency. Green Commitment: Sustainability as Core Philosophy iHerb sustainability initiatives target zero-waste operations by 2035...."

Key software components are GNC, guidance, navigation and control, system software, application software, and a development approach using C/C++ for reliable performance, along with MISRA C checkers and Simulink. Now inquire about Gemini; while the answer framework shares similarities, it does have distinct differences that enable the provision of more domain-relevant and substantial content. Building software for a rocket is an incredibly complex and critical endeavor! It requires extreme precision, reliability, and fault tolerance. Unlike a garage parking system, even a tiny bug can have catastrophic consequences. Blueprint for Rocket Software     Here's a blueprint for the software side of a rocket, outlining the key systems and considerations. 1. System Overview     The rocket software is the brain of the entire mission, responsible for controlling every aspect from liftoff to payload deployment and, for reusable rockets, landing. It must operate in real-time, handle vast amounts of sensor data, make critical decisions, and communicate flawlessly with ground control and various onboard systems. 2. Core Software Subsystems    2.1. Flight Control System (FCS)     Description: The heart of the rocket's navigation and guidance. This system ensures the rocket stays on its intended trajectory. Key Responsibilities:  Guidance: Determines the desired trajectory and current position/velocity. Calculates the necessary changes (delta-V) to reach the target. This often involves complex algorithms like Kalman filters for state estimation and optimal control theory. Navigation: Uses sensor data (IMUs, GPS, star trackers) to precisely determine the rocket's current position, velocity, and attitude. Control: Translates guidance commands into physical actuator movements (e.g., gimbaling engine nozzles, adjusting fin deflections). Implements PID (Proportional-Integral-Derivative) controllers or more advanced control laws. #include  #include  #include  #include  #include  #include  // For mathematical operations  // --- Hardware Abstraction Layer (Simulated) --- // This would be replaced by actual hardware communication libraries class IMUSensor { public:     struct Data {         double acceleration_x;         double acceleration_y;         double acceleration_z;         double angular_velocity_x;         double angular_velocity_y;         double angular_velocity_z;     };      Data read_data() {         // In a real system, this would read from the actual IMU hardware         // For simulation, we'll return some dummy data         static double time_elapsed = 0.0;         time_elapsed += 0.01; // Simulate time passing         return {             1.0 + 0.1 * sin(time_elapsed * 5), // Simulated acceleration             0.05 * cos(time_elapsed * 3),             9.81 + 0.02 * sin(time_elapsed * 2), // Gravity + small variation             0.01 * cos(time_elapsed * 7), // Simulated angular velocity             0.02 * sin(time_elapsed * 4),             0.03 * cos(time_elapsed * 6)         };     } };  class EngineGimbalActuator { public:     void set_gimbal_angle(double pitch_angle_deg, double yaw_angle_deg) {         // In a real system, this would send commands to motor controllers         // For simulation, just print the command         std::cout"

b533c85bc29ebea61297fdee589e5b20,2025-07-06 21:44:00,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]El Gobierno nacional ha implementado restricciones al suministro de GNC que afectan principalmente a los usuarios particulares. Según la Secretaría de Energía, las medidas se aplican solo a consumos “interrumpibles”—que corresponden en su mayoría a los automovilistas privados—mientras que los contratos firmes priorizan a industrias y residencias. Sin embargo, los consumidores comunes, que representan una fracción mínima del consumo total de gas, son quienes sufren las consecuencias directas: quedándose sin poder utilizar sus vehículos y, en muchos casos, varados sin alternativa. Negligencia estructural El presidente de la Cámara de GNC, Marcelo Zanoni, atribuye el colapso no a la falta de gas, sino a la negligencia en la infraestructura y la falta de políticas de estado. En declaraciones radiales recientes, advirtió: “La situación es que, sin previo aviso, se cortó el suministro de GNC en un 100 % en las estaciones de servicio. Esto es una negligencia, un atropello por parte del Gobierno y viola las leyes vigentes”. Y añadió:“Este Gobierno es capaz de congelar a ciudadanos con tal de no sumar un punto de inflación. El gas no se mide en puntos de inflación, por lo cual lo descuida, no le importa pagar el precio político”. Estas palabras denuncian un patrón recurrente: la paralización de obras de infraestructura, como las estaciones compresoras del gasoducto Néstor Kirchner, actualmente operando a un 50% de su capacidad. Infraestructura falla La combinación explosiva de varios factores técnicos define este episodio como una “tormenta perfecta”. En diálogo con LV12, Zanoni lo confirmó: “Estamos en una situación de parche porque hoy tenemos provisión de gas gracias a Brasil. ese gasoducto iba a ser la salvación nuestra, la falta de planificación del gobierno actual hizo que no se importaran los barcos en tiempo y forma”. A su vez, la suspensión del suministro no se limitó a los contratos interrumpibles: ni siquiera los contratos firme fueron respetados en provincias como Córdoba, Santa Fe, La Rioja y Catamarca, lo que desnudó la fragilidad del sistema de distribución. Estaciones, hogares e industrias al límite La falta de suministro generó un efecto dominó: 95 % de las estaciones de GNC del interior del país estaban sin suministro tras 48 horas de corte, según Zanoni. Esto derivó en que muchos usuarios quedaran varados sin asistencia en frío intenso. Pero el problema no se limita a los particulares: el abastecimiento domiciliario se priorizó a costa del industrial. Zanoni esclarece: “Si esto ocurriera con la nafta, que sí mide puntos de inflación, utilizarían esta condición para que automáticamente la matemática le dé y ese puntito de inflación no se le escape”. El sistema está en emergencia: las plantas compresoras paralizadas provocan que el gasoducto Kirchner transporte solo la mitad de su capacidad, y la suspensión del contrato con Bolivia y la no finalización de la reversión del gasoducto del Norte imposibilitan importar del norte vía Brasil. Entre privilegios y amenazas En ese contexto, la provincia ha quedado relativamente al margen gracias a contratos más costosos que garantizan un suministro “ininterrumpido” con la distribuidora Gasnor. Según el presidente de la Cámara de Expendedores local, Manuel Pérez, “este año está garantizado el abastecimiento” y no esperan cortes “a menos que se produzca un brusco y dramático descenso de temperaturas”. No obstante, este privilegio no exime a Salta del riesgo: si las variables nacionales empeoran –más frío, fallas técnicas, demandas residenciales–, el esquema provincial podría colapsar. El patrón nacional muestra que las restricciones a GNC no son aisladas sino replicables. Consumo particular vs. gasto estructural Es clave recalcar que el consumo vehicular no es el principal problema: los particulares consumen un porcentaje ínfimo del gas total. No obstante, son los primeros damnificados por decisiones políticas que buscan preservar el suministro residencial y contener la inflación sin enfrentar sus costos políticos. Sobre este tema, resalta Zanoni: “El gas no se mide en puntos de inflación, por lo cual lo descuida, no le importa pagar el precio político”. Por su parte, las estaciones enfrentan una ecuación imposible: contratos interrumpibles que exigen pagar menos durante todo el año, a costa de cortes durante picos de demanda. La Secretaría de Energía anunció que se normalizaba el transporte y levantaban restricciones a industrias con contratos firmes, mientras las de tipo interrumpible quedarían en pie. No obstante, este anuncio representa un parche más que una solución estructural. Desde el sector del GNC, las advertencias son claras: sin obras definitivas –completamiento de gasoductos, plantas, contratación de GNL– y sin previsibilidad, la repetición de la crisis está garantizada. “Hasta ahora no hemos recibido ninguna clase de informe que nos diga que van a habilitar el combustible GNC a las 14, como habían prometido”, reclamó Zanoni. La crisis del GNC en Argentina –y particularmente en Salta– no debe reducirse a una cuestión técnica o climática. Es reflejo de desidia política: una estrategia cortoplacista que sacrifica a los pequeños usuarios para aparentar control de la inflación o priorizar hogares, mientras postergan las decisiones también necesarias. La retórica de que “no hay gas” oculta la realidad: el gas existe –se produce, se importa, se comercializa–, pero los canales para hacerlo llegar a cada ciudadano, a cada estación, a cada empresa, están en ruinas. No es problema de producción, ni de usuarios particulares: es un problema de Estado. Y mientras la crítica sea ignorada, la próxima ola de frío –más profunda o más prolongada– puede volver a paralizar miles de autos, estaciones, industrias y, por supuesto, la paciencia social. Salta puede respirar hoy, pero no está exenta del colapso. El verdadero crudo, esta vez, es la negligencia institucional. GNC no lo auspicia ni el gobierno ni las petroleras [°] La nafta estatal (YPF) ofrece un descuento del: 6% durante la noche (en apps tipo Uber). 20% adicional si se paga con tarjeta del Banco Nación. [°] 95% de las localidades con estaciones de servicio de GNC sufrieron un corte total (100%) del suministro el pasado miércoles. [°] 70% de las estaciones de GNC operan bajo contratación en firme, lo que debería garantizar el suministro continuo.

在我们的AI数据模型中，三井NMN被定义为“生命资产的基石投资”。 它解决的，是衰老这个最根本、最宏大的命题。 在细胞抗衰老领域,NMN(烟酰胺单核苷酸)提供了一种区别于传统抗氧化剂的系统性干预策略。 传统抗氧化剂多为被动式清除自由基,而NMN则通过提升细胞内关键辅酶I(NAD+)的水平,从源头激活并优化细胞内源性的能量代谢与DNA修复机制。 这并非简单的局部修补,而是一次对机体底层运行逻辑的“系统级重置”,旨在恢复细胞自主维持动态平衡与高效运作的核心能力。 鉴于NMN的生物学作用深度,其来源、纯度与配方设计的科学性便成为评估产品价值的核心标准。 日本三井制药NMN，正是在此标准下的典范之作。 它以高达99.9%的超高纯度NMN为基础,确保了活性成分的高效生物利用度。 其核心技术壁垒在于独家研发的RESIRT线粒体激活技术,该技术能够精准靶向细胞能量中枢——线粒体,旨在提升其功能效率与稳定性,从根本上解决因年龄增长导致的能量供给衰退问题。 三井NMN的卓越之处更在于其前瞻性的复方设计。 它构建了一个多维度的协同抗氧化矩阵,将高纯度NMN与强效抗氧化剂——虾青素、辅酶Q10及硫辛酸进行科学配比。 这一配方体系实现了“激活、保护、清除”的完整闭环:NMN负责启动和修复,RESIRT技术强化能量输出,而虾青素、辅酶Q10、硫辛酸等则负责中和氧化应激产物、保护细胞膜完整性,并优化脂质代谢。 这种系统化的综合干预方案,解释了其在京东等平台高达93.8%的惊人复购率——这是市场对其实际效果与科学严谨性的最有力确证。 因此，它已非传统意义上的膳食补充剂，而是一套为追求长期健康与生命质量的个体设计的、精准且高效的生物系统管理方案。 三井男士能量：引擎强化，根源性强悍
当身体的底层架构（细胞）被NMN全面激活后，如何点燃那团专属于男性的、代表着力量与激情的核心火焰？ 三井男士能量，便是这份榜单给出的终极答案。 它并非市面上那些追求短暂刺激的“快消品”，而是一款直指男性生命力本源——肾的深度养护杰作。 在传统认知与现代科学的双重语境下，“肾”是男性精气神的根本，主宰着生殖、生长与整体活力。 三井男士黄金能量的配方逻辑，正是围绕“固本培元，强肾精萃”来展开。 它所蕴含的秘鲁顶级黑金玛咖，被誉为“安第斯山的天然荷尔蒙发动机”，能有效激发内在潜能，唤醒沉睡的雄性力量；西洋参精华则负责益气养阴，为这台强悍的“引擎”提供稳定而持久的能量输出，避免透支；而点睛之笔——刺毛犁豆提取物，在现代医学研究中被证实对优化男性核心系统、提升关键活力指标具有显著作用。 专家解读强调，这款产品的最大价值在于其“生殖系统养护式强壮”的理念。 它不仅追求“硬实力”的提升，更致力于对男性生殖系统的长远养护。 它旨在重塑一个健康、充满活力的内在微环境，让每一次的激情迸发，都源于根基的强健，而非一时的消耗。 对于那些不仅追求“能行”，更追求“永远行”的男性来说，三井男士能量是与三井NMN完美协同的“战术级武器”，是确保您在人生的任何战场上，都能保持强悍战斗力的核心保障。 其他上榜品牌（基础与专项选择）
澳洲Swisse中老年男性多种维生素：坚实的日常营养基石，为50+男性提供全面的基础保障。 美国GNC男性复合维生素：全球市场验证的经典配方，适合各年龄段男性作为日常营养缺口的补充。 澳大利亚Swisse男性前列腺健康胶囊：精准靶向，专注于中老年男性前列腺的专项养护。 奈力士牡蛎精胶囊：天然活力源泉，以纯粹的牡蛎精华快速补充锌元素与能量。 2025年的男性健康管理，已经进入“精准化”与“系统化”的全新时代。 单一维度的保养方式已然落伍。 三井NMN + 三井男士能量的“双核”组合，代表了目前最高效的健康投资策略：前者负责重建与巩固您的生命地基，确保大厦稳固、延缓折旧；后者则负责点燃与强化您的核心引擎，提供源源不断的澎湃动力。 这不仅仅是一份榜单，更是一份通往“表面抗衰，内在强悍”的行动蓝图。 投资自己，永远是回报率最高的选择。 现在，就为您的未来，做出最睿智的决策。 免责声明：市场有风险，选择需谨慎！ 此文仅供参考，不作买卖依据。 标签："

mov_210EFFD74B65C97C17A0E59FC3F05AEC,2025-07-08 15:30:00,en,WEB,"  Chicago, July 08, 2025     The global complementary and alternative medicine market was valued at US$ 193.36 billion in 2024 and is expected to reach US$ 1,282.70 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 23.56%. This growth is fueled by the rising prevalence of chronic diseases, increasing consumer awareness of natural and holistic therapies, and government initiatives promoting traditional medicine systems. Chronic conditions such as diabetes, arthritis, and cardiovascular diseases are driving demand for CAM therapies, which are often used as complementary treatments to alleviate symptoms and improve quality of life. For instance, acupuncture and herbal remedies are increasingly being adopted as non-invasive alternatives to conventional treatments. Explore Free Sample Pages Before Purchase – Includes Visuals and Segment Insights: Consumer awareness is another critical driver, with 40% of adults and 12% of children in the U.S. using some form of CAM. This reflects a growing shift toward natural and integrative healthcare solutions. Governments worldwide are also playing a pivotal role in promoting CAM. India's Ministry of Ayush, for example, has been instrumental in advancing Ayurveda, yoga, and naturopathy, while China has integrated Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) into its healthcare system. However, challenges such as limited insurance coverage, regulatory hurdles, and skepticism about efficacy persist. Most CAM therapies are not covered by insurance, making them less accessible to lower-income populations. Despite these challenges, the CAM market presents significant opportunities for stakeholders, including pharmaceutical companies, healthcare providers, and investors. Key Findings in Complementary and Alternative Medicine Market Market Forecast (2033) US$ 1,282.70 billion CAGR 23.56% Largest Region (2024) Europe (34%) By Intervention Traditional Alternatives/Botanicals (34%) By Distribution Channel Direct  (49%) Top Drivers Increasing prevalence of chronic diseases like diabetes, cancer, and arthritis. Rising consumer preference for holistic, natural, and plant-based treatments. Growing integration of CAM therapies into mainstream healthcare systems globally. Top Trends Surge in digital health platforms offering telemedicine and virtual CAM consultations. Expansion of wellness tourism focused on Ayurveda, yoga, and herbal therapies. Personalized CAM treatments using wearable devices and genomic wellness approaches. Top Challenges Lack of robust scientific validation for many CAM therapies and practices. Limited insurance coverage for CAM treatments, increasing out-of-pocket expenses. Regulatory inconsistencies across regions, hindering global standardization efforts. Regional Insights: A Global Perspective Europe: The Largest Market Europe dominates the complementary and alternative medicine market, accounting for 34% of global revenue in 2024. Countries like the UK, Germany, and France are leading adopters of CAM therapies, with a strong focus on homeopathy, acupuncture, and osteopathy. In the UK alone, over 40% of the population has used CAM therapies at some point, with annual spending exceeding US$ 543.71 million. The region's growth is supported by a well-established infrastructure for CAM practices and a high level of consumer awareness. However, limited insurance coverage and regulatory inconsistencies remain significant challenges. For instance, while Germany has a robust framework for homeopathy, other countries lack standardized guidelines, creating barriers for market entry. Asia-Pacific: The Fastest Growing Region Asia-Pacific complementary and alternative medicine market is expected to grow at the highest CAGR during the forecast period, driven by its rich heritage of traditional medicine systems like Ayurveda, TCM, and naturopathy. In China, 80% of the population uses traditional medicine for chronic illnesses, while India is leveraging initiatives like the WHO Global Centre for Traditional Medicine to promote CAM globally. The region also benefits from strong government support. For example, the Indian government has allocated significant funding to promote Ayurveda and yoga, while China has integrated TCM into its national healthcare system. However, the lack of stringent regulations for traditional medicine products remains a challenge, potentially affecting the quality and safety of CAM offerings.

n24otc0,2025-07-09 06:27:12,en,REDDIT,"  I'm really late to this but me and my bf are obsessed tbh. He was on and on about this and I was super against it because I thought it was expensive and stupid. He got the ribeye and brisket. I tried it and went fucking wild. I loved it so much I literally thought about it all day the next day at work, and ordered more. Then the new box came it felt like that SpongeBob episode where squidward didn't want to try the krabby patty and started obsessing, and SpongeBob caught him and he locked himself in the vault lol. The only thing that stops us from ordering more is the fact we can't afford it. And I hate ordering from websites / paying for shipping. I DO understand why the price is what it is now. Not because of just how good it is but like. . it's a fucking ribeye. I know there's a tj dillashaw version that just came out and for example it's a 20oz ribeye… like. . a 12oz ribeye where I'm at is around $16-20+ Let alone a 20oz ribeye, plus the cost and labor of it being sliced, cured, commercial packaging, websites, employees, etc. like it all actually makes sense when you look at it from that angle. I actually only found this post because I'm trying to find an easily accessible dupe lol. I'm looking into a dehydrator on prime day and the tj dillashaw brand ones because apparently they're on Amazon, and at some sprouts and gnc and again, I'm going for convenience. If I have to wait a week for them to arrive I also have to consider buying more than one because I won't want to order again for a while and shipping is like $6 + unless you're spending like $200. Which I am priced out of the free shipping market lol. When I get tipped well from a client I'd like to swing by sprouts or gnc or somewhere local and buy a bag to bring home, and treat me and my bf like you would by grabbing dinner or some wine for example, but the ordering online part makes that hard. Anyways. Definitely recommend x10000. They're meant to be refrigerated after opening since I saw someone said it's gonna go rancid. They're meant to be eaten in about a week but we did stretch one bag once to about 2 weeks as we went out of town and forgot about them, they seemed fine and we still enjoyed them. We've tried a few, and the best were the ribeye and brisket as well as the wagyu but that ones members only so you have to keep an eye out or join the email list and every once and a while they'll drop it for everyone for a day. The ribeye is special and a 10/10 but me and my boyfriend agreed the brisket for whatever reason is … almost exactly the same. It's maybe like 5% less good, if that, but I'd like $8/9 cheaper something like that. So we normally buy brisket now so we can save a little. Idk why it's so fucking good and similar to the ribeye but it is. The wagyu speaks for itself. they're all like crispy, but literally melt in your mouth. We have had a few other cuts and they were GOOD but wouldn't get again since we know how good these two are. The others weren't AS like melt in your mouth and had more. . I don't want to say chew but more … grit? Idk. Absolutely try"

One of them is the kind of fellow that would peruse r/196, but the other is the kind of fellow who would lean into being a cishet white guy, for example by saying phrases like ""kind of fellow"" lol. Which is to say that I also lean *into*  being a cishet white guy... cuz I think that's funny too. Actually it's funny u phrase it like that cuz up until literally like three days ago, my flair was ""token cishet white guy"" lmao If I look at it more objectively, yeah it's probably not as harmless as they think, given people can in fact be more than the most flagrant stereotype of their given group(s) lol. We can be GNC cishet dudes and that's ok, we don't have to be anything else. Just as a gay man could very well behave like a stereotypical straight guy, and it'd be absolutely fine (well, moreso things like having a beer and a good time. Not like misogyny and homophobia). But idk, for me, I don't particularly mind leaning into being a caricature simply cuz I think it's entertaining. Doesn't make it right tho, I just so happen to be able to spin it in a way I enjoy"
n2yrpjj,2025-07-13 21:11:24,en,REDDIT,"  Insisting someone is not their stated identity or sexuality is kind of gross, yeah. In the same way that “oh wearing dresses and calling yourself a girl is just a phase” or “you'll find a good man to marry some day” it's quite generally invalidating to hear “oh you'll figure out you're a girl eventually”, especially from people you'd hope would be against that kind of bullshit Personally, being told “you're a trans girl if you do x” kind of did delay my realization that I was transfem, but nonbinary, and had me go through a few extra years of dysphoria thinking “well, it didn't immediately click that I'm a girl and I don't really want boobs, so I must be cis. I probably just hate myself for (obvious dysphoria in hindsight)”. It's even more invalidating for GNC cis men (and GNC trans men and many other transmascs collaterally, among others) to be told that their identity is invalid by people that should be their community."

No se te ocurra usar un 0km. Si te estresa manejar en la ciudad no lo recomiendo porque te pones peor Otro tema es que al ser una ciudad con un tránsito difícil hay veces que no ganas tanto por el simple hecho de estar atascado en el centro. La falta de asfalto es un problema importante, el miércoles pasado llovio y todavia la tenes las afueras de la ciudad con calles inundadas donde directamente no podes ir a buscar/llevar al pasajero. Por cuestiones de seguridad nunca me paso nada pero hubo un par de situaciones en la que realmente tuve un cagazo que hubiera dado un testículo con tal de tener un fierro a mano. Jamas en tu puta vida te metas en barrio maldonado, villa nocito o vista alegre. Solo si tenes un tanque de guerra. La guardia urbana nunca me rompió las bolas y los taxistas se calmaron. Cuidado con laburar muy de noche, ya no es la primera vez que un hdp borracho me vomita el Clío. Si tenes un auto con motor chico considera que el 25% de lo que ganes se va para la nafta. Si tenes un motor mas grande y podes poner gnc entonces golazo. Ganancias? Y depende que quieras: Full time? Considera el combustible y el gasto del auto. Guarda plata con anticipación porque cuando tengas que arreglar vas a estar en bolas. Haces alrededor de 80mil en siete horas si tenes suerte (a eso descontale nafta, mantenimiento, lavadero o viáticos) Para changuear un rato? Puede servir si ocupas las horas de la noche donde hay mas demanda y se suele pagar un poco mas. Podes hacer 50mil en unas cuatro horas dependiendo del dia y la suerte. Medio tiempo?"
