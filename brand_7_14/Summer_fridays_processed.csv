1lb699n,2025-06-14 11:15:04,en,REDDIT,"  Hi all! I could really use some advice or insight. I'm currently a full-time healthcare worker at a primary care clinic, and I have an approved FMLA accommodation to leave work 30 mins early on Thursdays and Fridays due to my son's needs— he's severely autistic and requires multiple therapies. I'm a single mom with no support here, and I've been trying to juggle everything alone. Right now, my son is away visiting my parents in another state for the summer so I could have a break and reset emotionally. But even with him gone, I'm completely burned out. I've been struggling with extreme fatigue, chronic migraines for the past two weeks, trouble concentrating, feeling lightheaded, and difficulty sleeping. I come home from work, eat, and crash—or lie awake all night. This isn't just “being tired.” I feel like my body and brain are shutting down. And I've realized it's not just from parenting—it's the accumulation of everything over the past year and it's been a lot. To be fully honest, I've had a hard time with tardiness this year. Some of it was due to my son's therapies or morning challenges—but some of it was poor time management caused by mental exhaustion. I've also missed a decent amount of work, but most of that has been covered by FMLA and doctors notes. Since my FMLA was approved, I've felt tension at work. Management has been visibly frustrated. They've been trying to push new responsibilities on me (like scheduling my own patients, which wasn't originally part of my job), and when I've tried to communicate or ask questions, I've often felt dismissed or shut down. Despite everything, I love my job and I don't want to lose it—but I'm seriously struggling. I plan to start therapy ASAP and was wondering: Can a therapist write a letter explaining my burnout and recommending temporary protections? Even though my current FMLA isn't for me, but for my son? I just need time and space to get myself together, and I'm trying to be proactive before it's too late. Any legal or HR-based insight would be so appreciated."

tw_sl_54639e700e17cacdf8e1f6f4439489bc,2025-06-14 20:21:29,en,WEB,"  Fox Nearly a decade before directing ""Spider-Man,"" Sam Raimi gave the world ""M.A.N.T.I.S."" To answer the most burning question right away, ""M.A.N.T.I.S."" stands for Mechanically Augmented Neuro-Transmitter Interception System. It's the nickname that Dr. Miles Hawkins (Carl Lumbly) gave to the elaborate metal exoskeleton that he strapped around his body to fight crime. Dr. Hawkins had previously been paralyzed from the waist down after being shot in the spine by the police while trying to rescue a child in peril during a riot. He tried to sue the police department, but instead found a racist conspiracy designed to keep the city's Black population oppressed. Moved to justice, Dr. Hawkins invented the M.A.N.T.I.S. exoskeleton to help him walk. The exoskeleton worked better than he could have possibly imagined, though, granting him superhuman strength. He elected to become a bug-inspired superhero, doling out justice and confronting police corruption. To round out his superhero accoutrements, Dr. Hawkins also outfitted his exoskeleton with paralysis darts he could fire from his fists, and a bodysuit that could deflect bullets. He also invented a flying car he called the Chrysalis. He had a few confidants, including the co-inventor of his exoskeleton, John Stonebreak, played by Roger Rees. His police contact was Lieutenant Leora Maxwell, played by Galyn Görg. The police chief was played by reliable character actor Gary Graham from ""Alien Nation,"" ""Star Trek,"" and ""Robot Jox."" ""M.A.N.T.I.S."" was co-created by Raimi and Sam Hamm (the screenwriter of the 1989 ""Batman"" movie), and debuted in the summer of 1994 on Fox. The show aired on Friday nights, however, meaning that the network didn't have a lot of faith in it. The series only lasted for 20 episodes, coming to an end in March of 1995. A few years later, the Sci-Fi Channel picked up the series, and found that two additional episodes had never aired. Sci-Fi finally presented the full 22-episode run of the series. Technically, ""M.A.N.T.I.S."" lasted until September of 1997. It's also pretty great, in that mid-budget, '90s sci-fi kind of way. M.A.N.T.I.S. was serious, until it wasn't Fox Given the origin of the hero, one might think ""M.A.N.T.I.S."" was a hard-hitting series about racial justice, meant to appropriately vilify the police and provide justice for the Black community, which was topical in 1994. The beating of Rodney King had only occurred three years prior. The following May, the LAPD cops were let off the hook, inspiring six days of riots. ""M.A.N.T.I.S."", on its surface, was created to address the righteous rage over the brazen racism that cops constantly express. This seemed like a far more political effort than anything Raimi had previously done; he was typically a more whimsical filmmaker. But the sense of racial justice in ""M.A.N.T.I.S."" eventually became only one of its features. It very quickly evolved into a pretty wacky show, involving time travel, parallel universes, superpowered villains, and an invisible dinosaur (!) . The police conspiracies transformed from natural corruption into a villainous plot enacted by a wicked Lex Luthor-type businessman named Solomon Box, an old friend of Dr. Hawkins. Brion James played Solomon Box, but was eventually replaced by ""Dirty Harry"" actor Andrew J. Robinson, who had also appeared in things like ""Hellraiser"" and ""Star Trek: Deep Space Nine."" Like with many shows, the pilot episode was very different from the series that followed. Most of the characters were different in the pilot, as was the M.A.N.T.I.S. costume (he wore a trench coat at first). And, yes, the stories were all silly. One episode sported a villain who shunted his consciousness into a computer. Another kidnapped M.A.N.T.I.S. and replaced him with a clone. There was a mad scientist who spliced jellyfish DNA into human subjects, making jellyfish people. Most of ""M.A.N.T.I.S."" was directed by recognizable TV vets whose names will be familiar to fans of ""The X-Files."" Rob Bowman, David Nutter, Joe Napolitano, Kim Manners, and Cliff Bole all took a crack at directing. M.A.N.T.I.S. is better than Sam Raimi's first Spider-Man movie Fox ""M.A.N.T.I.S"" was Sam Raimi's first foray into television, and he would move on to developing ""Xena: Warrior Princess"" while it was still on the air. The people who remember watching ""M.A.N.T.I.S."" in 1994 and 1995 likely remember its tone to be a little dark, especially in its first few episodes. A revisitation, however, reveals that it was just as silly as it sounds ... but while also dealing with some serious themes of racial justice. Raimi, of course, had learned to balance violent superhero mayhem with light comedic whimsy in his 1990 film ""Darkman,"" and he would try to strike that balance again in 2002 with his adaptation of ""Spider-Man,"" a film so successful, it spawned two sequels and a crossover movie. Call me kooky, but ""M.A.N.T.I.S."" does a better job of balancing its cartoonishness and its drama than Raimi's first Spider-Man movie. The first Spider-Man mishandled its more personal elements by reducing them to overplayed melodrama, while its action was weirdly low-energy. Raimi would improve greatly by the time he got to ""Spider-Man 2.""..."
1lbieql,2025-06-14 20:34:02,en,REDDIT,"  Hi all, I'm a full-time ultrasound tech in Florida and a single mom to a young, severely autistic child who requires frequent therapy. Earlier this year, I was approved for intermittent FMLA to leave 30 minutes early on Thursdays and Fridays to transport him to his sessions. The background: To be fair, I've had ongoing issues with tardiness for about a year—some related to my son's behavioral needs, some due to poor time management, and frankly, burnout. I've also missed work, though most of it has been covered either by FMLA or valid doctor's notes (I've had a surgery, serious illness, and a severe allergic reaction—all medically documented). I'm not perfect, but I've been trying to keep my head above water in a really overwhelming season. I just want to do my job and take care of my kid without constantly feeling like I'm under a microscope. The complication: As of June 3, my son has been out of state for the summer with my parents. I've continued using my FMLA-accommodated schedule, even though he's not currently attending therapy, because he'll be returning in August and I didn't want to risk losing or needing to reapply for the accommodation. I've never hidden this—I have written confirmation from his ABA therapist that he's been actively attending therapy and will return in August. On Thursday, I messaged my coworkers in our group chat, explaining that while I was willing to see a late patient that day (since my son isn't currently home), I wouldn't stay past my original scheduled time if the patient wasn't prepared. I also reminded them that once my son returns, I'll be unavailable for patients past my FMLA time. One coworker, who has had past issues with me, privately texted our manager about the fact that my son is out of state. That same day, I was called into a meeting with my supervisor and two managers and accused of: •Refusing patients •Giving orders I'm not authorized to give •Failing to complete duties like patient scheduling and pre-visit planning They told me I'd be written up and required to sign a disciplinary action. However, I've never been trained to do those tasks. I don't know how to schedule patients, handle insurance, or deal with copays—and I have written proof from a manager confirming I haven't been trained. My productivity is low, but that's because I'm not being given patients—not from a lack of work ethic. After the meeting, I emailed HR and my supervisor stating that I didn't feel comfortable signing any disciplinary action when I had not been trained for the responsibilities they claimed I was neglecting. HR responded that no disciplinary action had been finalized—but then pivoted the conversation, suddenly saying the “real issue” was my tardiness, which had never been brought up during the meeting. Previous concerns with HR and FMLA: •When I initially applied for FMLA, I explicitly told HR that I didn't feel comfortable attending a meeting without knowing my rights. I have proof of this. They told me “that's why you need to attend” and pressured me into joining. •I was denied FMLA in that first meeting, and my supervisor was harsh and dismissive—HR witnessed this and said nothing. •I later submitted documentation from my son's behavioral pediatrician and was approved. •But even now, nobody explained how to properly use FMLA: •I was submitting doctor's notes to managers instead of HR •I wasn't told FMLA needs to be renewed annually •I was never taught the correct procedures Since my approval, tension has increased. My supervisor is short with me. One coworker is openly passive-aggressive in our chat. Nothing is ever said to her, but I'm being reprimanded for things I didn't even know I was responsible for. Now: •HR and my supervisor want another meeting next week. •I don't feel safe or capable of defending myself alone. •I'm physically and emotionally exhausted—dealing with burnout, chronic fatigue, migraines, and anxiety. •Even with my son away, I come home and collapse from sheer mental overload. My questions: 1. Does this sound like retaliation for using FMLA? 2. Was it inappropriate to continue using my FMLA-approved schedule while my son is away, if I have documentation that he's returning to therapy soon? 3...."

mxx5dd3,2025-06-15 15:15:57,en,REDDIT,"  I hope you succeed in what you are doing. But be aware:  freelance workers have to sell themselves to employers OVER AND OVER again. That's a lot harder than getting into somewhere stable ONCE. I did some freelance work and the hiring process was similar to the process for staff--lots of interviews, lots of people with a veto--but no stability, no sick days, no vacations, lose a day's pay everytime there's a holiday, when the rest of the staff got Summer Fridays off, I didn't. I had the same hierarchies and the same personalities to deal with. It was like all the worst parts of being staff, but none of the benefits. Far from playing to my strengths, this setup made me work through my weaknesses over and over again, and when I needed something, I was a second class worker. Several places promised conversion to staff after a few months but held that conversion as bait, sometimes never given at all. I truly hated the freelancing I did."

mov_2CF5009B4222333C80E1C7B5E9548727,2025-06-15 15:51:58,en,WEB,"  The Pale Fountains were an English band formed in Liverpool in 1980, and composed of Mick Head, Chris McCaffery, Thomas Whelan, Andy Diagram, Ken Moss and John Head. Inspired by 1960s music (Love, Burt Bacharach), the band released two much-loved studio albums on Virgin, Pacific Street (1984) and …From Across the Kitchen Table (1985). This 4-CD box set brings together both albums as well as the B-Sides, mixes, and some previously unreleased material from the Virgin vaults all housed in a sturdy box with extensive sleeve notes by Classic Pop's John Earls. The music was mastered by Tony Dixon, with vinyl restoration (presumably for some of the singles) by Andy Pearce. The albums sounded pretty good with their previous CD incarnation, but this new master from Tony Dixon adds more punch and depth to the mixes. I bought both albums on cassette in the early 80s and also treated my self to the CD reissues a few years ago, but this box-set blows those reissues out of the water. The original two albums have never sounded better and the two discs of single cuts and unreleased demos adds real value to this release. Pacific Street and beyond    Pacific Street, the bands debut from 1984, is my favourite of the two Virgin studio albums, and is an album I still regularly play to this day. It has a consistent sound - often with bossa-nova rhythms topped by traditional pop / rock arrangements and a smattering of Andy Diagram's trumpet. Whilst no doubt influenced by the pure-pop of Burt Bacharach, Arthur Lee's Love and with a bold 60s swagger, the guitar exhibits a sharp new-wave bite that cuts through, adding a darker side to the songs. The album was produced by the band and Howard Gray (Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark / Public Image Limited / Simple Minds) and has intelligent and rich arrangements, with delicious harmonies and rapidly changing tempos. My favourite track arrives early in the album sequence, with the atmospheric Unless. In another universe, this song would have been a top 10 hit. Deep synths take centre-stage, a rarity, and Head's vocal is spell-binding. When the sequenced synth line kicks on the 3/4 mark, I'm transported to a musical nirvana. https://youtu.be/Ddluysg9NiE?si=TEOk4384weQaMMZI     (Don't Let Your Love) Start A War is a key album track, with chiming guitar lines and a restrained verse that makes the chorus all the more powerful. Beyond Friday's Field is the most experimental track on the album, led by Diagram's trumpet and a sparse 60s spy-thriller backing. The music coming out of Liverpool in the 80s was in such a rich vein of form, and The Pale Fountains were a key component of the wave of classic artists. Abergele Next Time has a confident swagger, and sits in your mind long after the last note has faded away. The bonus tracks from the era are solid gold. The “radio-hits” Thank You and Palm of my Hand are absolute classics . I didn't realise until recently that multi-instrumentalist Alan Rankin, who had recently quit The Associates, produced the Pale Fountains 1983 non-album single Palm Of My Hand. I bought the single when it was released but either didn't pick up on Rankine's involvement at the time or simply just forgot, but listening to the song with this knowledge, his influence is clear. The first disc ends with a couple of extended versions and the non-album track Love Situation, which suggests that Mick Head jumped into a time-machine and invented Primal Scream, bringing back this song on his return to the mid-80s. The second disc contains rough mixes and demos from around the time of the first album. Given the age of the recordings, the quality is surprisingly good. Highlights from this disc include the light mix of Fight Think Love / Love Situation - Rough Mix Take 1, a song that would not feel out of place as part of a Hollywood film soundtrack in Spanish Tragedy (Beyond Fridays Field) - Rough Instrumental Mix and the Motown infused twisted pop of Take A Little Shelter - Rough Mix Take 2. A shout-out needs to be given for the second version of Sundrenched Girl (Crazier) - Rough Mix - with contains a full-band performance of this supremely catchy, steel-drum adorned slice of summer pop. …From Across The Kitchen Table    The second album finds The Pale Fountains in a more strident, confident mood. The urgent Shelter opens the album, whilst a bluesy and more ragged Stole The Love paves the way for my favourite track from the album, the timeless Jean's Not Happening, with a sublime guitar line from John Head. Bruised Arcade has stood the test of time, and I enjoyed becoming reacquainted on reviewing the album. It's Only Hard passed me by when I first bought the album, by this slow-paced Dylanesque piece hits more directly now. https://youtu.be/p6RFhVib1uw?si=UwY-Y91-eIdicSj5     The title track incorporates some 'of the time' synths in its intro before it develops into an enjoyable, intelligent piece of dark pop. The rockabilly swing of September Sting ends the album on a high. The 4th and final disc collects mixes and unreleased tracks from this period. An extended mix of the title track works well as does a darker mix of Bicycle Thieves. The b-side Just A Girl - Remix feels more like an a-side, from the Thank You era, featuring a strong chorus, with a hint of the pop-nous of Pete Wylie / Wah! from around this time. A lost Palies classic. A warm, full remix of Thank You is a welcome inclusion. A series of well-preserved demos make up the rest of the final disc. Highlights include the drum-machine driven The Outsider, with its excellent bassline, the restraint turns to wild abandon of Summertime (It's Hard) and the promise that was never fully realised of These Are the Things (Stay). So even if, like me, you own both of The Pale Fountains first two albums, this expanded box-set is a must-own release from one of Liverpool's best kept secrets.

mov_33064586DAA967624E698837D6759835,2025-06-16 08:45:22,en,WEB,"  PLANS for a new Domino's Pizza takeaway in Llandudno Junction have sparked objections from residents worried about noise, traffic, and disruption. Domino's Pizza UK and Ireland Ltd has submitted an application to convert the former credit union at 144 Conway Road into a hot food takeaway. The proposed branch would operate from 11am to 11pm daily and create around 25 jobs. But the plans have attracted objections from residents, raising concerns about late-night disturbance and parking pressures, as well as a “saturation of takeaway premises in the area”. The site is flanked by residential properties on two sides, and objectors say the location is unsuitable for a busy takeaway. MORE NEWS: New car park in Llandudno to be ready for summer - these are charges proposed Llandudno school which had 18 members of staff absent daily sees 'improvement' Conwy also received a petition opposing the takeaway signed by 42 residents. Danny White-Meir, who owns the nearby Enochs fish and chip shop, wrote an objection letter to Conwy County Council. “The proposal allocates only two designated parking spaces at the rear of the premises for delivery drivers, which is insufficient given the high demand for parking in the area,” he said. “Most residents rely on personal vehicles to commute to work, and the existing parking spaces along Stanley Oak Road and Conway Road are already heavily utilised by residents. The addition of delivery drivers, particularly during peak hours (5pm to 9pm on Fridays and Saturdays, with up to six-eight drivers), will exacerbate the parking shortage, leaving residents struggling to find spaces near their homes.” MORE NEWS: New café to open in Colwyn Bay in memory of baby who died aged 9 months 'Outpouring of love' after North Wales church damaged by lightning strike He added: “The proposal assumes that 25% of trade will come from customer collections, with most customers accessing the premises on foot. However, this overlooks the fact that people purchasing hot food, such as pizzas, typically do not walk significant distances to collect their orders, as hot food is best consumed immediately. It is far more likely that customers will drive to the premises, increasing the demand for parking spaces.” He also had safety concerns due to congested streets. Lauren Stanley added: “As a resident of Stanley Oak Road, Llandudno Junction, this development severely impacts the residents of this street,” she said. “We already have limited parking spaces for the residents. We also have a very busy takeaway on one corner of the street.

The addition of another outlet predominately serving unhealthy food would likely exacerbate these issues,” the letter from the health board said. The proposal includes external alterations such as new front windows and doors, and the installation of extraction and ventilation equipment at the rear, including grilles, an air conditioning unit, and a cold room compressor. The two existing parking spaces behind the building would be used by Domino's delivery drivers. Nearby properties include a beauty salon, restaurant, and another takeaway. Despite the objections, Conwy planning officers have recommended councillors be minded to grant conditional approval, noting it would bring a vacant building back into use.

He's spent his entire life swooning over the love stories filling up his shelves until one day, he was brave—or delusional—enough to write his own. He currently lives in the heart of Washington, DC. and when he is not writing or chasing his pup, Margot, around, he can be found daydreaming of untold happily ever afters or on Bookstagram shouting about the books he loves. And snacking, like, all the time. ABOUT WINGING IT WITH YOU Popular bookstagrammer Chip Pons's gay rom-com about two men who impulsively pose as a couple to compete in a reality show contest just minutes after meeting at an airport, and their run-in with the very real feelings that start to simmer between them. Catching flights . . . and feelings Asher Bennett thought his relationship was just fine. Until he's unceremoniously dumped at the Boston airport ahead of the world-wide travel competition reality show, The Epic Trek. Armed with only a ticket and righteous indignation, Asher finds the closest solace he can: a mimosa and mozzarella sticks combo at an airport TGI Fridays. Still, Asher is determined to find a new partner and luckily, right in front of him is a smooth-talking airline pilot ready for takeoff. Theo Fernandez has been grounded. He's the only pilot that has never taken a vacation and the edict has been passed down: prove you're prioritizing a work-life balance or say goodbye to your wings. As he struggles to bask in his new downtime, without reconnecting with his family, he stumbles upon the perfect opportunity. The handsome guy who ""stole"" his mozzarella sticks at his favorite terminal eatery has a sudden opening for a partner . . . on a nationally televised reality show. Theo and Asher buckle up to fake date for the cameras, but as they do the undercurrents of attraction make them wonder if their on-screen chemistry hints at something bigger. Do they have the courage to leave behind their baggage, and wing it together for another chance at love?..."
72F72DF41B603744953180ABCA226CBC,2025-06-16 10:22:24,en,PRINT,"  PLANS for a new Domino-s Pizza takeaway in Llandudno Junction have sparked objections from residents worried about noise, traffic, and disruption. Domino-s Pizza UK and Ireland Ltd has submitted an application to convert the former credit union at 144 Conway Road into a hot food takeaway. The proposed branch would operate from 11am to 11pm daily and create around 25 jobs. But the plans have attracted objections from residents, raising concerns about late-night disturbance and parking pressures, as well as a -saturation of takeaway premises in the area-. The site is flanked by residential properties on two sides, and objectors say the location is unsuitable for a busy takeaway. MORE NEWS: New car park in Llandudno to be ready for summer - these are charges proposed Llandudno school which had 18 members of staff absent daily sees 'improvement' Conwy also received a petition opposing the takeaway signed by 42 residents. Danny White-Meir, who owns the nearby Enochs fish and chip shop, wrote an objection letter to Conwy County Council. -The proposal allocates only two designated parking spaces at the rear of the premises for delivery drivers, which is insufficient given the high demand for parking in the area,- he said. -Most residents rely on personal vehicles to commute to work, and the existing parking spaces along Stanley Oak Road and Conway Road are already heavily utilised by residents. The addition of delivery drivers, particularly during peak hours (5pm to 9pm on Fridays and Saturdays, with up to six-eight drivers), will exacerbate the parking shortage, leaving residents struggling to find spaces near their homes. - MORE NEWS: New cafxC3 to open in Colwyn Bay in memory of baby who died aged 9 months 'Outpouring of love' after North Wales church damaged by lightning strike He added: -The proposal assumes that 25% of trade will come from customer collections, with most customers accessing the premises on foot. However, this overlooks the fact that people purchasing hot food, such as pizzas, typically do not walk significant distances to collect their orders, as hot food is best consumed immediately. It is far more likely that customers will drive to the premises, increasing the demand for parking spaces. - He also had safety concerns due to congested streets. Lauren Stanley added: -As a resident of Stanley Oak Road, Llandudno Junction, this development severely impacts the residents of this street,- she said. -We already have limited parking spaces for the residents. We also have a very busy takeaway on one corner of the street. This development will only add to the already restricted parking by adding another takeaway on the opposite corner. - She added: -What will the level of dangerous parking be if this was to ever become another takeaway? - Conwy Town Council objected to the plans on the grounds of highway safety, with Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board also raising concerns about obesity in the area. -The local health (board already faces) challenges as the local area is already facing significant health challenges related to overweight (residents) and obesity.

7c8fea1d9e128a13039cff6fcde9685e,2025-06-16 12:46:00,en,WEB,"  The Safekeep by Yael van der Wouden has won the 2025 Women's prize . It revisits a dark, under-explored chapter of Dutch history. It asks what happened to all the possessions that Jews who were forced to flee or were taken to camps during the second world war had to leave behind. The trauma of this history hangs over the novel, a haunting buzz beneath this tale of a woman slowly losing control over her small and regimented world one summer in the early 1960s. That woman is Isabel, who lives alone in her sprawling family home in a rural area of the Netherlands. The house is the centre of Isabel's world and she spends most of her time obsessively keeping it in order, as her late mother would have wanted. To her, “a house is a precious thing”. Isabel is its possessive and careful caretaker, suspicious of anyone she perceives as interfering in her relationship with it. Isabel's relationship with the house is tied to a difficult childhood under the influence of her domineering mother, who is still asserting control from beyond the grave. Isabel is stuck in this history, aware that “she belonged to the house in the sense that she had nothing else, no other life than the house”. It is the only place she has, and can assert, a sense of control. But the house does not belong to her, she is simply its keeper. It will be inherited by her brother when he wants to start a family – a future which seems incredibly distant because of his playboy and big city ways. That is till he delivers his gauche new girlfriend, Eva, to stay at the house while he is away on business. Looking for something good? Cut through the noise with a carefully curated selection of the latest releases, live events and exhibitions, straight to your inbox every fortnight, on Fridays. Sign up here . What lies beneath? Set 15 years after the end of the second world war, van der Wouden's debut novel unearths terrible crimes from the past and the psychological legacies that still ripple across generations of families, ancestral homes and communities. It is a novel about theft, expropriation and convenient cultural memory loss. The Safekeep succeeds in blending the political with the domestic and the historical with the personal. The writing is restrained yet lyrical and poetic, allowing space for the readers to realise how easily injustice and a historical wrong can be quietly concealed under the surface of everyday respectability. The story unfolds slowly, like coming across an old box of photos long forgotten in a dusty attic, which reveals a devastating narrative in fragments. The Safekeep is the debut novel from Dutch author Yael van der Wouden. Roosmarijn Broersen Eva's penetration of Isabel's perfectly kept and regimented world, makes it clear to Isabel that the house and the objects she lovingly “kept” over decades were never, and will never, be hers. This graceless young woman stands in contention to everything Isabel (and her mother) thought a woman ought to be. As they spend time together and her desperate attempts to enforce control fail, Isabel has to confront the uncomfortable reality of her inheritance – that of the role she plays in her family, the life she has chosen to lead and the house she loves so dearly. There is mystery in this novel: pieces of a broken plate, missing objects, imperfect memories. The careful attention to detail and suspenseful prose makes the house take on a ghostly presence in the novel, becoming an archive of both sentimental memory and moral ambiguity."

Valhalla York is seeking a premise licence for the former ironmongers at Grape Lane, Whitby, which it won planning permission to convert to a pub and holiday let last month. The first and second floors will become three one-bedroom flats while a two-bedroom holiday apartment will be created on the third floor. The proposed licensable activities include the sale of alcohol and the playing of music. If the premises licence application is approved, alcohol could be sold and recorded music could be played from 11am to 11pm, Sunday to Thursday, and from 11am to 11.30pm on Fridays and Saturdays. The opening hours would be the same and the sale of alcohol would be for consumption “on the premises only”. Public comments regarding the application must be sent to the council by Friday, June 20 “stating the grounds for the representation”. Valhalla was granted planning permission despite objections from residents, who said the Grade II-listed property should not be altered because of an “over-proliferation of pubs in Whitby”. A council report stated: “Grape Lane is ultimately a public street, where pedestrians can freely pass – and do so already to a high level, and the licensing team would require assurances that patrons congregating outside the premises is discouraged.” As a result, a condition was set by planning officers that there can be no use or access of the external seating area by customers at any time. Vincent Roberts and Matthew Beddingham, co-owners and founders of Valhalla York, said: “Valhalla York has been a real success story and we always dreamed of one day having another venue. “We love the town, its people, its history and feel of the place and it'll be a very similar recipe to what makes Valhalla York tick but not quite the same.” They said they had “every hope to be opening the doors for summer 2026”. Anyone who wishes to make representations regarding the licence application can send comments in writing to: North Yorkshire Council, Licensing Services, Town Hall, St Nicholas Street, Scarborough, YO11 2HG, or by email to licensing.sca@northyorks.gov.uk."

What to Read Next Meanwhile, after Summer Spellman and Nina Lucas knowingly take the substance, their fun turns deadly… ""The night takes an unexpected turn, leaving Summer and Nina distraught,"" shares Harriet Bibby, who plays terrified Summer. ""Even without the drugs they'd be feeling really shocked and upset about what happens to them, so times that by 10 with the LSD in their system. They're really worried and scared…"" The frightening events of the evening begin as Aadi Alahan takes Bernie Winter's advice and hosts a spontaneous midsummer party . But the partygoers' innocent fun is soon sabotaged when arrives with a bottle of LSD… As the gathering gets going, Aadi is left upset when a romantic moment between him and Amy turns into a misunderstanding. His mood sours even more when he spots Brody with LSD and kicks him out – but when he empties the drug into three cups, some of the guests decide to experiment. ""We see the effects of the drugs hit Nina and Summer, and they seem to be having a lovely time,"" explains Harriet. ""Then the police arrive – or so they think, it's actually just DS Swain and Carla looking for Betsy. But Summer and Nina get very paranoid because they know they've taken something they shouldn't. So they decide to duck out of the party."" It's after the pair leave the house that the situation takes a dangerous turn. Confused and high, Nina and Summer head to Roy Cropper's café. They sit in the dark and begin to panic when they hear police sirens. What's happened to them during their drug-fuelled night? ""Nina and Summer witness something,"" teases Harriet.

The morning after, Summer and Nina try to make sense of what they saw. But as they try to piece together what happened, someone else's condition deteriorates after unknowingly taking LSD. Will Summer and Nina come forward? ""Nina wants to report what they've seen,"" reveals Harriet. ""But Summer thinks there's no point as they don't know for sure whether something happened. They look back on the night with regret – it's not just Summer and Nina in a dangerous situation…"" Scared by what she remembers, Nina betrays Summer and opens up to Roy. But while Roy urges his niece to go to the police, Kit Green tells Aadi he'll need to make a statement about the drugs at the party.

I got a new job last year and instead of quitting UPS, I decided to see how long they would take to fire me by just showing up when I want. It started out with just missing about 2 days a week for about a month straight. Nobody said nothing. not a writeup/verbal warning. My fulltime even asked if I wanted Fridays scheduled off since I was mainly missing Fridays lol. Then for about 3 months straight I only showed up Mondays and Wensdays, where I finally got a verbal warning for attendance. For about the last eight months I only work Mondays and Tuesdays because my steward told me if your gonna miss days, miss them in chuncks instead of singles because 3 days missed is still just 1 write up instead of 3 write ups for 3 single days etc. I've had two 14 day suspensions, 3 week suspension, 5 two day suspension,  and 4 intent to terminate letters! I even told my full time that after the 1st intent to terminte letter shouldn't you just be able to walk me out the next time I show up after a call in? and he said ""It's just not that easy"" ??? My hub is not a small hub, its a big Texas one, when I do show up to work I do work hard, and the only thing that sucks about this little experiment is all my coworkers hate me because they even know this is messed up and I don't blame them. MY next step is just show up mondays these next few summer months and hopefully be done by peak lol. any other suggestions?"

The Outsider, atop the Kimpton Journeyman Hotel. at 310 E. Chicago St. in Milwaukee's Third Ward, was recommended because of both its drinks and unique appetizers, as well as its views. Yelp Elites are locals in a city who nominate themselves to be on the squad and, if accepted, receive a badge on their profile. According to Yelp, the badge is a mark of trust, indicating that someone is a reliable reviewer with recommendations worth following. ""The Yelp Elite Squad is a fun group of passionate locals writing, photographing and adventuring their way through the city and beyond,"" Yelp said.

mov_22BE7C39ABC9DC2A7D1C27E4C540A215,2025-06-17 10:49:09,en,WEB,"  A Coronation Street actor has hinted at impending trouble for Gary Windass in future episodes. This comes as fresh spoilers suggest peril for Gary, who seems to vanish, causing worry among his family next week. Earlier this week, after backing Lou Michaelis following her husband Mick Michaelis' arrest for the murder of police officer Craig Tinker, Gary finally saw her true nature. On Friday evening, Gary's wife, Maria Connor, who has been suspicious of Lou, discovered her eyeing the salon's cash at the Platt family's residence during their summer barbeque. Even though Lou chose not to take it, Maria jumped to conclusions and a tussle broke out, resulting in Lou tripping and crashing through David Platt's cherished glass coffee table. After the incident, Gary escorted Lou to the hospital, where they exchanged a charged look, while Maria was mistakenly arrested for Actual Bodily Harm (ABH) after Lou claimed her son, Brody, had reported her to the police, reports Belfast Live. On Monday evening, Lou visited Gary's home to express her gratitude, where they shared a drink alone while Maria was away. After memorising Gary's passcode, Lou took the chance to send herself a damning text from his phone while he was in the loo. Later, Lou attempted to kiss Gary who rejected her advances before she threatened him, warning him to comply with her demands or she will spill the beans to Maria. However, Gary dared Lou to tell Maria as nothing had transpired and later announced to his family that he was leaving the cobbles to stay with his mum for a bit. Maria was left with her suspicions on high alert as she directly questioned him about cheating on her with Lou, to which he denied. Meanwhile, a smug Lou was spotted perusing the text she cunningly sent from Gary's phone, which read: ""I want you. When can I see you again?"" . With Gary waving goodbye to the cobbles on Monday night, his exit quickly raises alarm bells. In upcoming teasers, a troubled Liam confides in Maria that Gary's gone AWOL and hasn't returned from visiting his mum as expected, prompting Maria to hide her own worries for Liam's sake. This twist follows Coronation Street's Jack P Shepherd dropping hints of impending peril for Gary on the street. The actor behind David Platt dished to Digital Spy: ""[Mick's] still in it and he's still doing naughty, bad things. I'm kind of involved in that, in a way. ""And then something happens with Gary. Something bad happens with Gary. I'm kind of involved in that."" Coronation Street continues on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8pm on ITV and ITV X.

mov_78FCCB9D3BDA665E4AD23437FA6B3488,2025-06-17 13:45:45,en,WEB,"  Amazon Prime Day 2025 is just around the corner—here's what we know so far. Mark your calendars: It's almost time for Amazon Prime Day 2025. This year's Prime Day dates have officially been announced—and it's going to be bigger and better than ever before. For the first time, the annual two-day shopping event will be running for a whopping four days—offering shoppers more time to save on everything from durable luggage and tech accessories to home goods and shoes. You're probably wondering: When is Amazon Prime Day? This summer, it will run from Tuesday, July 8, through Friday, July 11, 2025. A longer sale means more chances to save on Amazon's steepest discounts of the year across all major categories, including electronics, camping gear, clothing essentials, comfortable shoes, premium beauty products, and more. Whether you've got a wish list ready or are new to the retail giant's Black Friday–like deals, we've put together a quick rundown of everything you need to know to make the most of Amazon Prime Day. We even gathered some already-running Amazon deals to shop now and top-selling items from last year's Prime Day to consider adding to your travel gear haul. What is Prime Day? In case you're not familiar with Amazon's upcoming sale, let's get you up to speed: Amazon Prime Day is an annual savings event in which shoppers can find thousands of deals across all major categories. It's usually a two-day event in July, but this year Amazon is extending its offerings for a full four days. For the past few years, Amazon has offered a similar sale in October, giving eager shoppers another chance to save ahead of Black Friday. Electronics and home goods tend to be the most popular items during these events—and amount to the biggest savings—but we typically also see great deals on clothing and shoes, luggage, beauty products, outdoor gear, and family travel essentials. When is Prime Day 2025? Amazon Prime Day began on Tuesday, July 8, and will run through Friday, July 11. The best deals tend to sell out before the sale ends, so if you see something you really want on sale, don't hesitate to add it to your cart. Do I have to be a member to participate? Yes, you do have to be an Amazon Prime member to take advantage of these deals. Membership costs $14.99 per month or $139 per year (college students get a discounted rate), but you can sign up for a free 30-day trial here to try it out without committing to a full year. If you do keep your Prime membership account, you'll have access to same-day, one-day, and two-day shipping on millions of products; two-hour grocery delivery via Whole Foods; Prime's Try Before You Buy program; and more. What sales can I shop during Prime Day? During Prime Day, you'll find a variety of can't-miss sales: Lightning Deals, which only run for a few hours; Deals of the Day, which run for one specific day; and Best Deals, which extend beyond the two-day sale. Shoppers will find deals on Amazon devices, as well as discounts across all categories, including luggage, clothing and shoes, tech accessories, outdoor gear, beauty products, home goods, and more. There are also discounts on big ticket items that travelers love, like noise-canceling headphones, e-readers, wearable tech, suitcase sets, and backpacks. What did Traveler readers purchase most last Prime Day? Below, we've rounded up some of the most-purchased products our readers bought during Amazon's last's Prime Day via our recommendations. In-flight essentials and travel accessories reigned supreme, with many of our readers stocking up on neck pillows, lightweight steamers, and handheld fans. Our readers also took advantage of deals on popular tech gadgets, like Apple AirPods, AirTags, and portable chargers. Some of the best Prime Day deals last year were on skincare and beauty favorites, including Hero's Mighty pimple patches and Crest 3D Whitestrips. And as always, our readers made sure to snag some camping essentials, too, including waterproof phone pouches and LifeStraw's personal water filter.

Learn more While many football fans are eagerly awaiting the start of the 2025/26 football season, there's plenty of other sporting events to tuck into this summer. Leading the pack is the FIFA Club World Cup, with the new-and-improved competition now in full swing. 32 of the world's best clubs are in the USA for the tournament, including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid and Paris Saint-Germain. Off the pitch, there's more must-see sporting events on the way in July, including the British Grand Prix at Silverstone, the Tour de France and the hotly-anticipated rematch between Oleksandr Usyk and Daniel Dubois. But as all of this sporting action is spread across a handful of broadcasters in the UK, it can be tricky to decide which subscription best suits our sporting tastes. With this, we've taken a look at a selection of major sports broadcasters including DAZN, Sky Sports and TNT Sports, plus the best deals currently up for grabs. READ MORE: DAZN to air every FIFA Club World Cup game for free – here's how to watch live in the UK READ MORE: Health app helped woman drop four stone in weight without giving up ice cream So read on for some of the highlights on the way this summer and the best deals to watch each one for less. DAZN While many sports fans associate DAZN with boxing, it's actually home to a whole lot more. Across June and July, the broadcaster is airing every game from the FIFA Club World Cup live from the USA. Fans can stream every fixture for free by setting up a free DAZN account, which also includes a host of documentaries, features and clips from previous tournaments. DAZN offers a paid Premium subscription for fans to stream in HDR picture quality and Dolby 5.1 Surround Sound, with fewer adverts and full access to the rest of the DAZN platform. Prices for DAZN Premium currently start at £9.99 for an annual plan, or £19.99 for the 30-day rolling Flex account. The DAZN App can be accessed on smart TVs, smartphones, tablets, games consoles, streaming devices and any device with a web browser. Watch the Club World Cup free on DAZN £0 DAZN Get DAZN here The FIFA Club World Cup will see 32 of the world's best club teams including Man City, Chelsea, Real Madrid, PSG and Bayern Munich play across 63 games from June 14-July 13. Fans can watch every match live and for free by signing up to DAZN. Aside from football, DAZN's boxing calendar includes Jake Paul vs Chavez Jr (June 28), Catterall vs Eubank (July 5) and Oleksandr Usyk vs Daniel Dubois 2 (July 19). However, keep in mind that select fights will only be available with pay-per-view and are not included in a standard DAZN subscription. In our review of the DAZN platform, we found the app occasionally slow to respond on an iPhone 13, but performs smoothly when content is up-and-running, while streaming on a TV presented no issues. Sky Sports Even though we're between Premier League and EFL seasons, Sky Sports has plenty to tempt sports fans ahead of the new campaign kicking off in August. Sky is increasing its Premier League coverage from the 2025/26 season, with a 'record minimum' of 215 matches broadcast live, which it claims is more than any other broadcaster. These are all available with Sky's flagship TV and sports package, the Essential TV and Sky Sports bundle, for £35 per month. This provides access to every fixture broadcast on Sky Sports, including more than 140 at weekends, evening matches on Fridays and Mondays and three midweek rounds, plus the return of the festive round of fixtures. Signing up for a 24-month Sky Sports package secures access to both the 2025/26 and 2026/27 Premier League and EFL seasons. It includes nine dedicated Sky Sports channels, such as Golf, Tennis, Cricket and F1, meaning members can catch every practice, qualifier and race from the British Grand Prix at Silverstone on July 3-6. It also includes more than 100 regular channels, alongside free Netflix and Discovery+ subscriptions. Perhaps the main downside with Sky is its 24-month contract length, which may be offputting for those not looking to make a long-term commitment. If this is the case, Sky also offers a 30-day rolling plan for £43 per month, which provides flexibility for a higher monthly cost. Existing Sky customers can add Sky Sports to their package for £22 per month. Sky Sports is also included with Virgin Media's £59.99 per month Bigger Combo bundle + Sports, which justifies its higher price tag with the inclusion of 362Mbps broadband and a shorter 18-month term. TNT Sports The broadcaster formally known as BT Sport is available as part of a Discovery+ Premium subscription here in the UK. Its coverage is spread across four TV channels and up to six digital or red-button channels, plus Eurosport 1 and 2. TNT broadcasts a range of sports to suit any fan, including football, cycling, tennis, snooker, Premiership Rugby, MotoGP, boxing, UFC and more. Events to watch this month include the remaining NBA finals games, with the Tour de France starting on July 5. There's also the Bennetts British Superbikes and World Superbikes, plus the Grand Slam Track events from Miami, Philadelphia and Los Angeles. Looking further ahead, TNT Sports will once again broadcast select fixtures in the upcoming seasons of the Premier League, UEFA Champions League, UEFA Europa League and UEFA Conference League. This is all available with a Discovery+ Premium subscription for £30.99 on a rolling monthly basis through Discovery+ or Amazon's Discovery+ Prime Video channel. TNT Sports can also be added to new or existing Sky and Virgin packages for £20 and £18 respectively. TNT Sports has attracted criticism for its commentary on certain sports, with some users taking to Trustpilot to vent their frustrations...."
842a53c6bef2756c4da8c28904594f29,2025-06-18 12:05:00,en,WEB,"  Are you ready for a vibrant adventure through the royal streets of Jaipur? Known as the Pink City, Jaipur is a captivating blend of heritage, culture, and color. A Jaipur Day Tour offers a perfect one-day getaway packed with grand palaces, ancient forts, bustling bazaars, and lip-smacking Rajasthani cuisine. Whether you're traveling from Delhi or already in Rajasthan, this day trip guarantees an unforgettable taste of India's royal history. Start of the Day: Journey to Jaipur If you're coming from Delhi, the tour begins early in the morning, around 5:00 to 6:00 AM. You can travel by air-conditioned private car or take the Shatabdi Express train. The scenic drive through the Delhi-Jaipur Highway (NH48) is smooth and usually takes about 4–5 hours. Welcome to Jaipur – The Pink City Once you arrive in Jaipur, your local guide will greet you and start the royal exploration. The city's distinct pink hue, introduced in 1876 to welcome Prince Albert, sets the tone for an architectural and cultural treat. 1. Amber Fort – The Hilltop Marvel Start your tour at the majestic Amber Fort, perched on a hilltop overlooking Maota Lake. A UNESCO World Heritage Site, this fort is a masterpiece of Rajput architecture, featuring large courtyards, mirrored halls, and stunning frescoes. Don't miss the Sheesh Mahal (Hall of Mirrors), where one candle can light up the entire room! You can choose a jeep ride or an elephant ride to ascend the fort, both of which add a royal touch to your visit. 2. Jal Mahal – Palace on the Water On your way back from Amber Fort, stop at Jal Mahal, a stunning water palace sitting in the middle of Man Sagar Lake. Though entry isn't allowed, it's a perfect spot for photos and a short break with scenic views. 3. City Palace – The Royal Residence Next, head to the heart of Jaipur to visit the City Palace, the residence of the royal family. It's an incredible mix of Mughal and Rajasthani architecture, with courtyards, museums, and ornate doorways. Marvel at the intricate designs and royal garments, and learn about the history that shaped Rajasthan. 4. Jantar Mantar – The Astronomical Wonder Just a short walk away lies the Jantar Mantar, an astronomical observatory built in the 18th century. This UNESCO-listed site features giant instruments used to measure time, predict eclipses, and study stars. It's fascinating to see how advanced Indian astronomy was long before the modern era. 5. Hawa Mahal – The Palace of Winds Arguably the most iconic symbol of Jaipur, the Hawa Mahal is a five-story palace with over 900 windows, designed to let royal women observe the city's street life without being seen. The honeycomb structure is especially beautiful when the morning sun casts a golden glow through its latticed façade. Lunch at a Traditional Rajasthani Restaurant After a busy morning of sightseeing, it's time to savor authentic Rajasthani cuisine at a local restaurant. Try dishes like Dal Baati Churma, Laal Maas, and Gatte ki Sabzi, followed by traditional sweets like Ghewar or Malpua. Most tours offer a fixed menu lunch at a royal-style haveli or heritage hotel. 6. Shopping in Jaipur's Colorful Markets Jaipur is a shopper's paradise! In the afternoon, visit local bazaars like Johari Bazaar and Bapu Bazaar, famous for gemstones, block-printed textiles, handicrafts, mojari shoes, blue pottery, and more. The vibrant atmosphere and rich colors will leave you mesmerized. 7. Optional Stop: Albert Hall Museum or Birla Mandir If time permits, wrap up your day with a visit to the Albert Hall Museum, the oldest museum in Rajasthan, or the Birla Mandir, a modern white marble temple with a peaceful vibe and stunning views at sunset. Return to Delhi or Your Hotel Your Jaipur adventure concludes by early evening. If you're returning to Delhi, expect to arrive by 10:00 PM...."

Owner Carl Graham has become a local favorite by baking up delicious gourmet goodies. From Strawberry Crumble Cookies to Sweet Potato Honey Bun Cakes to Banana Pudding and Strawberry Shortcake, there's something for everyone. You can't miss Big Boys Bakery. Graham and his four sons are stationed from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. Saturdays at the corner of Ward Boulevard and Tarboro Street. They are in the parking lot of the convenience store across from the former Wilson Mall. But if you want to purchase his sweet treats, you better get there early. “It gets gone pretty fast,” Graham said. “I always sell out on Saturdays.” Graham's boys ­—  Kameron Murchison, 6; Tristan Graham, 10; Jayden Graham, 11; and Elijah Graham, 12 ­ — are by their dad's side. The boys package the sweet treats, interact with customers and then send them on their way. There's also a tip jar with a sign on it: “Tips please. Dad doesn't pay well.” Other top sellers include Cookies and Cream and Cookie Monster cookies. Graham said a lot of people stop by just to purchase the Sweet Potato Honey Bun Cakes. “We're Southern folks,” he said. “It's a cake, a pound cake and pie mixed together. It's the best.” Graham, who has been baking since high school, previously worked in the banking industry. But he decided to take chance and follow his passion in 2021 and started Big Boys Bakery. “I took a risk,” he said. “Baking allows me to be creative. It's why I love it so much.” Graham also teaches baking classes to youths in the summer and has a line of children's books available on Amazon. Graham said when he worked for the bank he didn't have as much time to spend with his boys as he does now. Having quality time with his boys has been a blessing. “Now I get to work, make money and spend time with my boys,” he said. “What's better than that?” Graham said his sons help him package and set up every Saturday. “They learn about money,” he said. “They learn customer service. They learn respect. They learn all the intricacies of being an entrepreneur.” On this particular Saturday, Graham and his sons didn't get a break. Regular and new customers stopped by to purchase all the popular treats. They nearly sold out within the first hour. “Everything has my mouth watering,” said Harold Ivery, who bought one of just about everything. “I have been looking for them for a while.” He said once he saw Big Boys Bakery's tent, he knew he had to stop by. Regular customer Felicia Hines stopped to get her favorite ­ — Strawberry Crumble Cookies. “They are soft and melt in your mouth,” Hines said. Shonda Williams said she's been hearing the buzz about Big Boys Bakery all over social media. She had to try them out. Graham said he will also take orders on Saturdays and will deliver them after 1 p.m. Graham does cater events and bakes cakes as well. Big Boys Bakery is also stationed at the Rocky Mount Stockyard Flea Market from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. on Fridays. For more contact Carl Graham at 252-299-4499 or visit his"

The initiative aims to revitalize the area, which has faced economic challenges. What we know: The city council voted to approve the ordinance during a meeting Tuesday, with the new rules permitting alcohol consumption in downtown Long Beach to begin this summer. SUGGESTED: Santa Monica turns 3rd Street Promenade into entertainment zone with open alcohol rules Big picture view: Santa Monica's Entertainment Zone opened with a soft launch on Friday, June 13. The soft launch has limited outdoor hours. Adults will be able to purchase a drink from a participating, licensed business and consume it outside between 11 a.m. and 10 p.m. on Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. SUGGESTED: Santa Monica's outdoor drinking zone now open Per California law, the five essential rules of the entertainment zone are: You must be 21+ and wear an official wristband to enjoy alcoholic drinks to-go. Only alcoholic drinks purchased from participating businesses are allowed. Alcohol taken to-go must be in a non-glass, non-metal container. Finish your drink before exploring another bar, restaurant or shop. Enjoy your alcoholic beverages within the Entertainment Zone boundaries, Local perspective: Senate Bill 969 went into effect this year, allowing local governments to create ""Entertainment Zones,"" which are designated outdoor areas where open container prohibitions are lifted for beverages purchased from participating restaurants and bars. The zones are governed by a specific set of rules intended to keep these spaces safe and enjoyable for everyone. What we don't know: It's unknown which parts of downtown will be designated as part of the ""Entertainment Zone."" The other side: While some are optimistic about the potential benefits, others express concerns that the ordinance may add to the city's challenges. Critics worry it could worsen issues like homelessness and crime. What's next: The City Manager will work with local law enforcement and other relevant departments and offices to establish a one-year Entertainment Zone pilot program in the Downtown Dining and Entertainment District and will return to City Council by the next meeting with recommendations outlining city processes and others like street closure, open alcohol, and event permits, and immediate steps to develop a management plan. The plan should have a target of allowing a pilot to begin in summer 2025. The Source: Information for this story is from the Mayor of Long Beach and previous FOX 11 reports.

In June of 2024, the patio transformed an underused deck into a vibrant, licensed gathering space in one of Vancouver's most scenic waterfront locations. With local food, drinks, and live music overlooking the North Shore mountains, the patio has become a standout example of how thoughtful partnerships can enhance public spaces. “This is the kind of partnership that reflects our commitment to creating welcoming, dynamic public spaces while supporting local business,” said Park Board Chair Laura Christensen. “It's exciting to see people coming together in a vibrant community space while enjoying good food and live music set against Vancouver's picturesque skyline.” Open Tuesdays through Fridays 3 pm to 10 pm and Saturdays and Sundays noon to 10 pm, the concession now features menu offerings from DownLow Chicken, a Vancouver favourite known for its bold, Nashville-style fried chicken. The expanded menu includes a variety of DL Chicken classics, including the OG Sando and DL Tenders, well as new options such as Burrito on the DL, the SWagyu Dog, and the Kits All-Beef Burger. Menu offerings continue to spotlight locally sourced products in line with the Park Board's “Think Local” approach, which encourages prioritizing Canadian food and beverage products wherever feasible. “This partnership has been an incredible way to connect with the Kits community,” said John Negrin, owner of Batch. “We've always believed that public spaces can—and should—be lively, welcoming places that bring people together. We're thrilled to partner with DownLow Chicken and continue our collaboration with the Vancouver Park Board as we grow into this epic location.” “We're excited to be partnering with the Park Board and the amazing Batch team, and to be joining them at such an iconic Vancouver location this summer: the famous Kitsilano Pool Concession,” Doug Stephen, co-founder of DL Chicken. “Kitsilano has always been a neighbourhood full of energy and great food culture. We can't wait to be part of that and bring the heat to the community with our fried chicken creations.” The partnership aligns with the Park Board's “Think Big” Revenue Strategy PDF file (210 KB) by demonstrating how public-private partnerships can create revenue opportunities that improve visitor experiences. About Batch Batch External website, opens in new tab is a Vancouver-based hospitality group known for transforming public spaces into relaxed, open-air experiences with locally sourced food and beverages.

mov_12113C531A2464DB414ED35971A33109,2025-06-20 14:29:38,en,WEB,"  Six children have died in hot cars across the U.S. so far this year. In March, a 4-month-old who was supposed to be dropped off at a babysitter's home in New Jersey was forgotten in a minivan for two hours. Just last week in North Carolina, a 7-month-old was also left inside a hot minivan. It's a preventable tragedy that makes dozens of headlines every spring and summer. Nearly 40 children die in hot cars each year, according to data compiled by Kids and Car Safety, a national nonprofit that fights for child safety in and around vehicles. Since 1990, more than 1,000 kids have died from overheating in a car somewhere in the U.S. In 2024, 39 kids died in hot cars, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), down from 2018 and 2019, when a record-breaking 53 children died in hot cars. Excluding car crashes, heatstroke is the leading cause of death in vehicles for children 14 and younger. The majority of hot car deaths happen because the driver forgets the child is in the car, according to the NHTSA. The federal agency has found that 47% of these deaths happen when the caregiver has forgotten to drop those children off at day care or school, and it usually happens at the end of the workweek, on Thursdays or Fridays. The second leading cause is when unsupervised children get into unattended vehicles on their own. “The majority of parents and caregivers are misinformed and would like to believe that they could never 'forget' their child in a vehicle,” Kids and Car Safety notes. “The most dangerous mistake a parent or caregiver can make is to think leaving a child alone in a vehicle could never happen to them or their family.” An average of 38 kids die in a hot car every year in the U.S. Why? Children who get trapped in cars suffer from pediatric vehicular heatstroke, which happens when the child's body temperature rises because of the internal temperature of a car. For example, if the outside temperature is around 70°F, the inside of a car's temperature will increase to over 100°F within the first 30 minutes. A child's body will overheat three to five times faster than an adult's body, according to the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. More often than not, caregivers leave children in hot cars by accident, which is why they're usually not charged with murder, David Diamond, a psychology professor at the University of South Florida, told Yahoo News. Diamond has studied cases of children dying in hot cars for 20 years. “These are not parents who don't care about their kids,” Diamond said. “Everyone can relate to forgetting. It's something that we all do.” Why do parents forget their children are in the car? Diamond says parents leave their kids in overheating cars because of habit and routine. The “habit brain memory system” kicks in when people perform repetitive tasks almost automatically or without a second thought. Diamond has said that knowing how to ride a bike or tie shoelaces are examples of habit brain memory. “You're driving home from work, and you've done it hundreds of times by yourself,” Diamond explained to Yahoo News. “It's your brain's habit memory system that takes you from work to home without even having to think about it. You drive straight home.” Even if parents feel confident that they will remember their child is in the back seat and needs to be dropped off somewhere before they get to the office, the habit brain memory system can overpower that new addition to a routine they've done hundreds of times without the child, Diamond said. He emphasized this is not a “syndrome” or rare mental disorder, but something most people experience because it's how the brain functions. It does not mean the parent or caregiver doesn't love their child. “'Forgetting' really is the right word,” he said of situations where parents leave their kids in hot cars. But “forgetting” the child because of routine doesn't alleviate any severity or pain from the experience for those parents. “It truly is a form of forgetting. And that's as simple as it is. It is a catastrophe."" Legislation could be the key to helping parents protect their kids Creating relevant safety laws is crucial to helping parents protect their children in these situations, Amber Rollins, director of Kids and Car Safety, told Yahoo News. Rollins cited data dating back to 1990 that shows children died less frequently from airbags while sitting in the front seat of a car after states made it illegal for kids under 13 to ride in the passenger seat. (It also wasn't required in all states for kids to ride in car seats until 1985.) But as more children were placed in the back seats of cars to avoid airbag deaths, kids were instead dying of heatstroke because they were forgotten in the car. From 1990 to 2023, 186 children were killed by overpowered airbags in the front passenger seat. During that same time frame, at least 1,126 children died in hot vehicles. Children can be unknowingly left behind in the back seat by even the most responsible parents and caregivers. Always remember to open the back car door after parking your vehicle and ""look before you lock."" (Kids and Car Safety Database, as of June 2025) This is why groups like Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, Safe Kids Worldwide, the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association and Kids and Car Safety are advocating for it to be mandatory for car manufacturers to build in radar systems that help notify parents if their kids are still sitting in the back seat. Part of the argument for why radar should be built into the cars — instead of tools parents can order online and install themselves— is, as Diamond told Yahoo News, because most people do not believe they would ever forget their child in the back seat of the car and wouldn't buy it. “The best kind of solution available right now is radar detection,” Rollins said...."

mov_4C768716B35434B95FE0FEE7A33C0FB9,2025-06-20 16:48:00,en,WEB,"  Bill Shaffer has had a career as a “big-time” Hollywood film editor/producer. But he'll never forget the first job he had as a paperboy for The Porterville Recorder. “It was a good job,” Shaffer said. “I always referred to it as the second best job of my life.” He's always wanted to pay tribute to that job and admits he's been “kind of obsessed” about the idea. Now Shaffer's obsession has become reality as his Paperboy display is part of the Porterville Historical Museum's newest exhibit Paperboys and Radio. The exhibit will open with gala party at 4 p.m. Saturday, June 21 and will be displayed through the summer. The exhibit in the museum's main exhibit room will feature history about The Recorder and KTIP Radio. But the focal point will be Shaffer's display of an exact replica of what the paperboy's work area was at The Recorder. And of course it includes an exact replica of the bike Shaffer used when he worked as a paperboy when attending Bartlett Junior High School from 1972 to 1974. The bike is loaded with everything the paperboy had and used, with the bag full of newspapers on the back of the bike and rubber bands and the collection book on the handlebars. The bike even has a baseball glove for good measure. And the bag is complete with a pop bottle that's placed upside down in the bag because that's the only way it fits. Shaffer said after his paper route he would go to “Craigs Stop N Shop and get a nickle or whatever it was” for the bottle. “I still have all my receipts,” from his time as a paper boys, Shaffer said. And while he doesn't have the bikes he used as a paper boy, he still has the license plates from those bikes. Shaffer, the son of legendary Porterville High Panther Band Director Buck Shaffer, went onto a distinguished career himself, working as a Hollywood film editor/producer. Shaffer has worked on Disney films Meet The Robinsons, The Mighty Ducks, Mulan, The Hunchback of Notre Dame and Atlantis. He's also known for the movies April's Showers, William Shatner's Gonzo Ballet and Sommore: Chandelier Status. But he has always fondly remembered his time as a paperboy. “Most of my friends had paper routes,” he said, “I can think of less friends who were not paperboys than those who were.” “It was like Newsies,” said Shaffer about the Disney film and Broadway play on what the life of a paperboy was like. Shaffer remembers receiving a plaque for having a perfect record over two months. “But it took me 24 months to get it,” he said. “It was great responsibility and we were held accountable. It was a wonderful time in Porterville. It was perfect.” Shaffer said he can remember trading paper routes with his friends so he could work in areas where got better tips. And since what paperboys made depended on what they collected Shaffer remained determined to collect the $2.50 a month subscription in the event one of his subscribers he delivered to moved. “I'd chase them down to get that $2.50,” he said. The Recorder donated a number of items for the exhibit, including old block set type that was used. There's also a map of all the circulation routes circa 1970s-1980s that's displayed next to the paperboy display. Shaffer remembered the routes he had that were on the map. The paperboy display will also include a mannequin that's a paperboy. Other items include a jar of rubber bands that was used by paperboys and a photo, circa 1908 when The Recorder began of paperboys with their bikes standing in front of the Recorder's original location. There's also a display featuring Graham Dean, who owned The Recorder from 1960 until his death in 1974. Another display includes the nameplate of longtime Recorder Editor Bob Moyle. In addition there are a number of old newspapers to peruse. There's also displays dedicated to the history of KTIP and a 30-minute loop of old KTIP broadcasts will be featured in the exhibit. The museum is open from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Fridays and Saturdays. Recorder contributing reporter Esther Avila contributed to this story."

tw_sl_43458df5d5184f69877b37240bd9e0c4,2025-06-20 19:00:00,en,WEB,"  Coronation Street's Summer Spellman actress Harriet Bibby has revealed all about the ITV soap's LSD storyline, while she teased to The Mirror 'big' scenes are on the way One Coronation Street star has promised ""big"" scenes ahead on the ITV soap in the coming months. Summer Spellman actress Harriet Bibby spoke exclusively to The Mirror about the upcoming storylines for her character. She also teased the 65th anniversary plans for later this year, and the big Emmerdale crossover airing in 2026. After months of not being onscreen much, Harriet explained to us that she was having a quieter year following the huge and emotional 2024 storyline, that saw Summer's father figure Paul Foreman die after battling motor neurone disease. Summer featured heavily in this storyline, with lots of difficult scenes for actress Harriet. Often in soaps when a character features in a massive storyline, they tend to then go quiet which is what has happened with Summer. But that's all about to change as next week, she takes centre stage once more. This time, Summer and other characters are caught up in a drugs storyline, as three characters take LSD at a house party. What follows is a dramatic and devastating sequence of events. Teasing more from Summer ahead, Harriet told us: ""I've had a quieter year this year after the big storyline with Paul last year. It was brilliant, we loved doing it even though every day we were in tears. Article continues below ""We will be seeing more of Summer in the coming months."" Harriet also teased the big stuff on the way, saying: ""I'm really excited about the crossover. It's never been done before. It will be fun and a little different. ""I am hoping to be a part of it but we have no idea. I'd love to meet the Dingles."" When asked about the 65th, she said: ""I'm the worst person to ask, everything you're asking me I'm asking the bosses! It will be something big though."" As for the huge drugs storyline that is coming up, Harriet teased what the fallout will be with it clear something has happened, and that Summer and pal Nina Lucas have been witnesses to something while high. Revealing ""the night takes a turn"", she teased: ""Even with no drugs in their system they'd be feeling really shocked, upset and concerned about what's just happened. ""So times that by 10 with the LSD they've got in their system and they're distraught. They're really worried and really scared about what's just happened."" Harriet went on: ""They figure out that they've witnessed something. Article continues below ""They have different opinions on what to do with this and it causes a little bit of friction between them. Nina thinks they should tell someone and report it whereas Summer is more convinced that they don't know what they've seen because they were affected by the LSD so there's no point in reporting anything as they don't know for sure that something happened. ""They're very confused by what they think they saw because they're unsure about what was reality and what was not."" On the future impact of the huge plot, she shared: ""I think when you find yourselves in quite dangerous situations, and it's not just Summer and Nina who are affected, you look back and think that was a really stupid idea. It affects a lot of different people in different ways and it could have been avoided if these drugs were not at the party.""

myxf7xa,2025-06-21 03:12:49,en,REDDIT,"  Stoping cravings is hard. I used to eat a lot at night too. A few tricks that have worked for to curb night eating: - Drink hot tea. Sometimes I just want *something*. Tea can help. - Don't sit on the couch. For me it's too close to the kitchen. If I want to watch TV or scroll my phone, I'll do it upstairs in my bedroom where I don't usually eat. - Go for a nighttime walk. This is easier in the summer when it's light out later but I like to go for a walk after I put my kids to bed. My husband and I used to go together but now someone has to stay home. I'll take my dog and listen to an audiobook. - Go to bed early. You can't eat if you're asleep! And if you get more sleep, you can wake up early to go workout. I take studio classes 6 days a week. Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday I do them very early at 6:30AM. Fridays I start my work day late and do it at 8, Saturdays also at 8 and I do a class Monday night at 6PM. I am lucky to have a supportive partner who covers the kid routines while I workout."

A limited edition (!!) Eos Marshmallow ""Super Balm"" lip treatment from the brand's ""secret menu"" so good that reviewers say it's better than Carmex for healing and better than Summer Fridays for quality. Lip care that also tastes like you're perpetually eating a s'more for less than $6?? My friends, life is good. Promising review: ""My new must-have! My number one go-to for healing lips was Carmex. This beat it. I love the consistency (very creamy/smooth), it's not heavily flavored or goopy, and it obviously smells amazing. It isn't overbearing and also doesn't keep coating your mouth like the Eos stick balms (still great, but more wax)."" —Breanah Shirazi Get it from Amazon for $4.99 (also available in Strawberry Acai). 2. Pacifica's Wanderlust Spray Perfume Trial Set with five unique, deliciously sunny scents you can swap between all summer long. Sometimes you wake up in a full seize-the-day ""Island Vanilla"" mood, and other days you wake up with the zen of ""Tahitian Gardenia,"" you feel me?? Psst — a lot of reviewers love these small samplers for traveling, too! Each set includes Island Vanilla, French Lilac, Tahitian Gardenia, Coconut Nectar, and Tuscan Blood Orange. Promising review: ""Honestly, these were probably the best perfumes I've owned, and I have A LOT of perfumes. They're small, but the perfect size for me. I was looking for a perfume, but didn't know which one, so I got this trial set. The scents are AMAZING! My favorite one is the Island Vanilla. I definitely recommend them if you don't know what perfume you want."" —Griffin Get a set of five from Amazon for $15. 3. Dove's Coconut Milk & Sugar Lychee Body Wash so moisturizing, gentle, and decadently-scented that you're going to feel fully transported to your ~happy place~ every time you lather it on. This is especially lovely for sensitive skin, since the plant milk base is nutrient-rich and sulfate-free to keep your skin feeling eeextra soft and loved. Promising review: ""I am loving this body wash, the smell is incredible and the formula is great. Way better than the original Dove formula body washes. I find that it's more gentle and cleansing without any weird film left behind. I hope they never discontinue this line because I love it!"" —D Get it from Amazon for $5.99 (clip the $4 off coupon on the product page for this price). 4. Vacation Orange Gelée SPF 30 Gel, a luxurious ""balm to oil"" blend designed to smell and look so good that you'll wonder how the SPF even got in there. The iconic orange tint blends perfectly into all skin tones and leaves a glossy shine, and the scent is nothing short of decadent — a ""French Riviera"" scent that blends sandalwood, bergamot, saffron, patchouli, and clove. Suddenly putting on sunscreen doesn't feel like a chore!! Vacation is a small business that specializes in sun care and fragrance products. Promising review: ""LOVE THIS!! The smell is glorious and immediately takes me back in time to when all my girlfriends would gather poolside and slather on the original St. Tropez Orange Gel. I don't understand why they ever did away with the original Bain de Soleil, but this new orange gel will make you feel like you are on an eternal vacation and give you the best tan you have ever had. Going to stock up on several more tubes and invite my college girlfriends over to the pool. Oh, and mine came with a key for the tube and a cute message from the head of the company.

Summer road trips and cruises just got a HECK of a lot more bearable. You can either use it as a scent inhaler or rub it directly on the tip of your nose for relief. Promising review: ""Took this on my first cruise. Anytime that I started to feel woozy I'd reach for it. I'm sure the required act of deep breathing helped a lot - and breathing in the fragrance of the essential oil is very calming and effective. Worked for me! Wonderful!"" —Willy&Lilly Get a pack of two from Amazon for $12.99 (also available in a pack of four). 2. Lumify Eye Drops, a product so beloved by TikTok that despite being more $ than other brands, it's the number one selling brand on Amazon right now. Reviewers swear by this for instant reduction in redness in their eyes, with visible differences within a minute of use. Learn more about different kinds of eye drops and what they can do at Cleveland Clinic. Note that eye drops can potentially mask symptoms of eye conditions, so you should talk to your eye doctor about what's right for you. And according to Mayo Clinic, you should avoid redness-reducing drops if you're looking for dry eye relief. Promising review: ""I have a big spot of blood vessels in the inner corner of my left eye. I use the expensive lubricant eye drops for moisture — I've used Visine, Clear Eyes, you name it. No eye drop has made my eyes look this great. Only Lumify! I was soo happy when I looked in the mirror and saw some beauty in my eyes instead of darkness and redness."" —Angela Leonard Get it from Amazon for $11.93. 3. La Roche-Posay Anthelios SPF 40 Tinted Sunscreen, aka the ""holy grail"" of tinted sunscreens — reviewers love this lightweight, buildable formula so much that a lot of them replaced their foundation with it altogether. If you're in the market for some subtle but effective coverage that won't get goopy or settle in pores, this is your sunscreen match made in heaven. Psst, you can find the Attitude Oceanly Lip Balm that the reviewer is wearing on Amazon! Note that the AAD recommends using at least SPF 30 and reapplying as needed for skin protection. You can read about sunscreen myths and facts from dermatologists for more information! Promising review: ""Like a lot of women over 50, I prefer to use a tinted sunscreen instead of foundation these days. I have tried a dozen, and this one is the winner, hands down! It has a thin, non-greasy texture, no odor, and is lightweight and buildable if you want a little more coverage in certain areas. Best of all, it does not settle into pores or fine lines at all. So many of the others I've tried, including high-end expensive ones that are pushed heavily on social media, are greasy and settle into every pore and line. I've put this on auto ship and hope it never gets discontinued!"" —Chartwell Get it from Amazon for $39.99 (available in four tinted and non-tinted). 4.

This not only helps gently remove dead skin, but moisturizes dry and cracked heels, so you'll really get some refreshing bang for your buck.

With this, I simply spray it on and immediately massage it in with my hands. The dead skin comes off effortlessly. There's no waiting time, and it's gentle on the skin.

While all these things might not seem like they have anything in common, they all have a home at Small Town Creations. When you first walk in the door, you are met with the pleasant smell of coffee beans, which are stored behind the front counter. Just past the beans you will find nice decorations for your home, as well as a few other things. Past that and through the double-wide doorway, you then come to an area with lots of items that can be customized. These items include cutting boards, tea towels, glassware, hats, bracelets, and more. Finally, at the back of the store is the trophy shop, where you can order your own custom engraved trophies. Kathie Williams is the owner of Small Town creations. With the help of Vicki Purcell, Williams caters to many different types of customers in her store. The story of how Williams got to where she is today is a very interesting one, and it largely begins at another store called the Yellow Unicorn Gift and Pipe Emporium. This business, once on the Square but now long gone, was where Williams got her first custom item with her name spelled correctly on it. Williams shared that she was never able to get anything with her name on it, but the Yellow Unicorn was able to do this for her when she was in third grade. She shared remembering feeling “like a million bucks” when she left the store that day. This sent her down her path of enjoying art. Years later, in 2016, Small Town Creations was formed, but not at all in the form it is in today. This version of Small Town hosted paint parties and was out of Williams's home. One year later, she rented a space at 201 S. Sangamon Street in Lincoln. Shortly after this, Williams and her husband discovered that Purcell, owner of the Awards Shop, was looking to sell her business. They had a conversation with her, and then decided to think about the opportunity. Two days later, the owner of Beans and Such reached out to Williams, informing her that they were looking to sell their business too...."

mov_E34D05017518AB9AED71ABBAD283606B,2025-06-22 06:38:27,en,WEB,"  Northeastern Pennsylvania audiences will have a diverse range of theatrical experiences to choose from this summer, with the Little Theatre of Wilkes-Barre presenting a family-friendly production of “Oliver!” alongside the innovative, gender-swapped musical revue “Backwards Broadway” at the Providence Playhouse in Scranton. “Oliver!” Brings Dickens to Life in Wilkes-Barre The Little Theatre of Wilkes-Barre is currently staging a musical adaptation of Charles Dickens' classic novel, “Oliver Twist.” While the source material explores the grim realities of Victorian-era child poverty, the production aims for a more uplifting tone. According to a theater official, the musical is “charming, whimsical” and ideally suited as the theater's annual spring offering for families. “It's something fun, it's upbeat, it's lighthearted, you know the family can come to it,” the official stated. The production features memorable songs and is supported by a 10-piece orchestra, promising a lively and engaging experience. “How do you beat 'Consider Yourself?'” the official asked, referencing one of the show's most iconic numbers. Sabrina Sickler, 12, of Blakeslee, stars as Oliver, bringing a nuanced portrayal to the role. Having studied both the novel and previous adaptations, Sickler is focused on conveying Oliver's difficult past through her physical performance. She describes her Oliver as “always being fidgety and really jumpy, because of his workhouse upbringing,” demonstrating the character's vulnerability with a gesture. Jordan Paris, portraying the Artful Dodger, is a seasoned performer with over 20 productions under her belt, and is simultaneously appearing in the Little Theatre's youth production of “Disney's Descendants.” “I just like the thrill of getting to entertain people, while also getting a good experience out of being on stage,” Paris explained. Performances of “Oliver!” are scheduled for Sunday, plus June 27-29, with showtimes at 3 p.m. on Sundays and 8 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays. Tickets, priced at $27.50, can be reserved at ltwb.org or by calling 570-823-1875. Scranton's “Backwards Broadway” Offers a Unique Twist In Scranton, Actors Circle and Diva Theater Productions are collaborating on “Backwards Broadway,” a musical revue that subverts expectations through gender-swapped performances. The production reimagines classic musical numbers, including “I Just Can't Wait to be King,” “Sweet Transvestite,” and “Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend,” maintaining the original lyrics while flipping traditional gender roles. The creative choice results in striking reinterpretations, such as female performers delivering the traditionally male-dominated “There Is Nothin' Like a Dame” with full theatrical flair, while a male actor takes on the role of the harassed subject. This innovative approach drew Kim Stenlake and her daughter, Kaylee Caramanno, to the cast. Stenlake, making her stage debut, initially hoped for a role in “Hamilton,” but found an even more compelling opportunity in “Backwards Broadway.” The mother-daughter duo will perform “Dear Theodosia,” a poignant duet from “Hamilton,” exploring themes of parental hope and legacy. Caramanno, a veteran of the theater, noted that men often receive the most compelling songs, and expressed excitement at the chance to perform these numbers herself. “Backwards Broadway” will run from June 26-29 at the Actors Circle stage, Providence Playhouse, located at 1256 Providence Road, Scranton. Showtimes are 7 p.m. on Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, and 2 p.m. on Sunday. General admission is $15, with discounts available for seniors ($12) and students ($10). Tickets are available for purchase online at actorscircle.com, and payment at the door will be accepted in cash or check only. Related"

I didn't feel too badly taking the weekend off, mainly because of this: For my brother and I, every day of the year is Father's Day. In our eyes, dad passed the barrier between ""great dad"" and ""national treasure"" a long time ago. There aren't a lot of men like my 99-year-old father left. He's a World War II Navy veteran who served aboard a Sumner-class Destroyer in the Pacific Theater, and was in Tokyo Bay the day the peace treaty was signed. He went in at 18 and came back at war's end not yet 20 - no doubt haunted by things he saw and experienced, things that nobody really talked about then. So he went to work. Lord, how he worked. He took the weight of running the family's sheep farm on his shoulders while also (at various times) operating his own dairy, pulling green chain at Crane Mills, running our neighbor's cattle ranch and - perhaps most back-breaking of all - cutting firewood in the 100-plus-degree summer heat for a few extra dollars. It wasn't uncommon for him to do several of those jobs on the same day, and then pull an all-nighter on a hay baler. I never heard him complain. Not once. Somehow, he also found the time to be the best husband and father there could be, an opinion unanimously agreed upon by the three of us who were there. I could write books about the man. Someday, I might. But today, I'm going to touch on the one part of his life that probably drew him the most acclaim from people who didn't know him on the ranch: his talent as a musician. Dad - that's Elwyn Wolcott to the rest of you - never had a lesson in his life. But he managed to teach himself how to play guitar, and piano, and harmonica, and the accordion. I'll note this all happened at least 50 years before there were YouTube videos teaching anyone how to do any of this; he learned, as the old saying goes, ""by ear."" So, when Sunday would roll around, he'd usually grab his guitar, my uncle Bob would pull out the fiddle, and we'd be treated to the sweetest sounding old-time country music ever played this side of the Carter Family. They played at community dances for several years, right through the 1950s. Then dad took about a 40-year performance break to run the farm and raise his family. He sold the ranch in 1996, and decided it was time for a comeback. He read about a boy in the Corning area who had been mauled by dogs and was in need of help. Modestly, my dad went to the manager of the local Safeway and asked if he could sit out front with his guitar and a tip jar in hopes of raising some money to help the boy. Several weeks and around $2,000 in donations later, the legend of the Safeway Troubadour was born. For most Fridays the next 20 years or so, my dad would be at Corning's Safeway - always with a tip jar, and always with a charity in mind. He never took a penny out of the jar himself unless it was time to put a new set of strings on his prized 1959 Les Paul Junior. (That guitar is a story all by itself. Dad bought it and a Gretsch tube amp in 1961 for $125. Seldom a week went by at Safeway without someone offering him several thousand dollars for the guitar - offers my dad always rejected, saying, ""I'd spend the money, but then I wouldn't have my guitar."") Through his musical talent, generosity and humble nature, dad became a good-sized local celebrity. He built a good-sized following of local people who would come out to hear him play, and even a fair number of out-of-towners who made it a habit to always stop in Corning if they were traveling through on a Friday. He was featured on every local TV station and in every local newspaper at some point or another. Along the way, he raised thousands of dollars for everyone from local people in need to organizations such as veterans groups and the fire hall. When asked about it, he'd say the same thing: ""I love to play, and I'm just happy to help."" There's a lot of power in those words, isn't there? It meant a lot to me that thousands of people got to see the same strong, funny and musically gifted man I'd known my entire life, and that he was able to get so much enjoyment from it while spreading joy (and much-needed help) to others. He set the bar impossibly high for me in each of those categories; I consistently fall short, but I hope he knows I'll never stop trying. As I'm writing this on a windy Saturday morning, the Les Paul Junior sits proudly in my closet. (I'll never sell it, so don't ask.) When I'm done, I'm going out to play some music with my friends. If I see a chance to do something to make the world a better place for somebody else today, that's what I'm going to do, because that's all I've ever seen my dad do in the 60-plus years I've known him. I figure that's all the best tribute I could ever pay to the man. So, as always, Happy Father's Day, dad - regardless of what day of the year it is.

mov_B6F9CAFEB9C2D00B1866F821C5D62CBB,2025-06-22 16:53:04,en,WEB,"  There is news (don't we all know), just not really anything momentous from me, ya dig? I don't mean to be dismissive- I'm really not. I wasn't immune to children and innocents dying before, and I'm not now, and I don't like war, especially one so stupid. L'appel du vide does come in clutch sometimes though, I'm not gonna lie. Don't want to be insensitive over here is all, is what I want you to know, but I refuse to blog about world events. Just know my current blah/blue mood is one I came by honestly and earlier in the week than the bombs getting dropped. I was blah before it was cool, I will have you know. Hipster discontent. I couldn't write this Friday, my writing night. I just had this restlessness and nebulous ache that couldn't be soothed. I pulled out my “what helps” list and went through it: took a quick nap, worked outside, accomplished a task, cleaned up the house, got my hands in the soil to weed, and started a fire in the firepit and had a couple of beers. (I usually don't drink on Fridays… but like… for science, at that point.) I couldn't shake it and I really did give it the ol' college try. I just decided I did NOT want to do a writing night in that headspace as I wanted less of what my brain was serving up, not more- so I watched a movie instead. The escapism worked, and the next day I woke up in a slightly better mood. So there is that. But before that- last Sunday- the Father's Day plans did not go off without a hitch. We've had recent flooding here (one storm dumped 8 inches of rain in a night) so the river looked like chocolate milk. The real risk is not the color of the water but the potential for underwater debris… so we didn't boat down to Lucas's tree. We wouldn't have been able to fish anyway. Plus the pollutants that get washed into floodwater… just no. You don't get on or in floodwater… so we didn't. We talked about it and went to Austin instead, with the plan of a hike to Twin Falls and stopping by a record store. Figured it was a good choice as the girls had never been to Twin Falls and Lucas and I used to take our dog (back when we had a good dog) out there. Sure it was near water so was probably flooded, but we wouldn't have gotten in… it can still be scenic even if the water isn't clear. So pretty. On the way I decided we'd go to the record store first, not second (just in case we got all sweaty and muddy) and I'm gonna tell you… the children can certainly spend some time deciding on what album to buy. I didn't rush them… they enjoyed themselves. We then drove out to go hiking, parked, turned around… and there was a WALL of black clouds coming in from the west… it was insane. Twin Falls isn't exactly a slot canyon, but considering it's between two hills it can flood like a motherfucker… how else did it get scraped down to bedrock, you know? I know this and that's why I triple checked that there was no rain in the forecast before we left. And yet here we were- staring at a huge storm. I checked the app and now it was 100% chance of thunderstorms for the next 3 hours. AWESOME. We got back in the car and got buffeted about by high winds and huge rain drops the whole hour long ride home… where it continued to rain for hours and hours. Because of the storm we couldn't barbecue like we'd planned either. And while we'd also planned to watch The Godfather… my oldest had assignments due for her summer classes and needed a shorter night than a 3 hour movie, so we watched Cool Runnings instead. (Very different vibe, lemme tell ya- but this way the youngest had a movie she could enjoy too.) It was a day of changing and changing plans. The thing that strikes me is that if we'd gone hiking first we'd have been an hour down the trail when the storm hit. And sure we'd have pushed through the cedars and climbed the hillside and come up and through instead of following the trail back… but damn. It would have freaked everyone out for sure, especially the little one. It all worked out… aside from Uber Eats delivering our food to the wrong house and then not crediting back the $45 it cost… it was a whole thing the entire day, honestly. We rolled with it and made the most of it that we could. I had cut flowers for him and written Lucas a letter that morning and put it by his side of the bed. The records the girls bought I told them were gifts from their dad. And when plans changed and changed and changed throughout the day everyone adapted and rolled with it and it was okay. Nobody freaked out or lashed out or anything- which my therapist says this is an indication of how much healing we've all done and is a positive sign- so I'll take it. I can hardly recall Father's Day last year. I know we planted a rose… I really can't remember much...."

08a966132143afe46a01a2299fdb1a74,2025-06-23 02:55:00,en,WEB,"  What Happened? Chase Briscoe was able to stretch his fuel the distance at Pocono Raceway, leading 72 of the race's 160 laps to win Sunday's (June 22) Great American Getaway 400. On his final pit stop, Briscoe left the pit box earlier than crew chief James Small wanted him to, creating a situation where Briscoe was in constant fuel saving mode for the remainder of the race. The fuel lasted, and Briscoe picked up his first career win with Joe Gibbs Racing. Denny Hamlin, in his return after missing Autodromos Hermanos Rodriguez, finished second, followed by Ryan Blaney in third. Chris Buescher and Chase Elliott finished fourth and fifth, respectively. What Really Happened? Dirty air strikes again. Ugh. The Next Gen car's ability to pass (or lack thereof) is no secret at this point as its fourth season in use progresses. That's why it's so frustrating that we are continually having these discussions of dirty air ruining the racing at tracks like Pocono, where there should be incredible racing for more than just two laps after a restart. Let's get one thing straight right off the bat: All the credit in the world to Briscoe for saving fuel for almost 40 laps around a 2.5-mile track. The team was clearly panicked when he left the pit box early, and it was a monumental feat to save fuel from the lead for the entire final run. But let's be 100% honest with ourselves. For as much fuel as the No. 19 had to save, there is no way in any sensible form of racing that the leader can ever save as much fuel as Briscoe did, and do it comfortably. Second-place Hamlin, the polesitter and leader for 32 laps on the day, couldn't even mount a challenge against his teammate because dirty air prevented him from doing so. And that's with Briscoe spending considerably more time out of the throttle than the No. 11, who was good to go to the end on fuel. The worst part is that this is beating a dead horse. There have been way too many conversations about how dirty air affects the racing in the Next Gen, and that all the leader has to do to maintain the lead is aero block and cause the driver behind him to lose all momentum. It's common sense that if you're running slower than someone behind you, there's a high probability you ought to get passed, right? So in what universe can the leader comfortably save massive amounts of fuel while maintaining an equally comfortable lead with no risk of losing spots? I'm not even gonna pretend to be an expert and offer suggestions on how to change it, but it's glaringly obvious it needs to be changed. Dirty air dictates the racing in the Next Gen car way too much. The cons outweigh the pros when it comes to the current package we have with the current car. Something has to change, NASCAR. Please stop sitting on your hands and do something about it. Who Stood Out? It's time to make a bold prediction. John Hunter Nemechek will make the playoffs in 2025. Nemechek and the No. 42 team called a perfect race strategically, and it netted ol' JHN a sixth-place finish at The Tricky Triangle, his sixth on the season. Last season, Nemechek earned only four top 10s throughout the entire year, and not only has he surpassed that mark, but he also has that top five from the Daytona 500 under his belt as well. Legacy Motor Club, despite an ongoing lawsuit with Rick Ware Racing over a charter, continues to build its team with both Nemechek and Erik Jones. Nemechek as a driver has made meteoric gains over last season and is currently sitting 22nd in points, just 71 points out of a playoff spot. A playoff spot is not too far out of reach for him, and as long as others continue to slide, we might be looking at a Legacy car making the playoffs for the first time since Jimmie Johnson came in as an owner of any kind in 2023. Who are the 'others' that could continue slide and allow Nemechek to make the playoffs? Who Fell Flat? Boy, Bubba Wallace cannot buy a good finish if he wanted to. After three finishes of 12th or better to stop the bleeding of finishing 33rd or worse three races before that, Wallace found himself with yet another DNF after blowing a brake rotor and hitting the outside wall (which unfortunately isn't the first time that's happened to Wallace). Talladega Superspeedway was the last time that Wallace had a quality run, finishing eighth after tacking on a stage win. Though he finished sixth and fourth at Nashville Superspeedway and Michigan International Speedway, one could argue it was luck more than anything. Those finishes certainly stopped the bleeding, sure, but it can only do so much if the No. 23 team continues to rack up DNFs. Paint Scheme of the Race Welcome back, Pickle Car. Even after changing numbers from No. 38 to No. 34 for 2025, Todd Gilliland and Front Row Motorsports still retained the support of Grillo's Pickles and brought back the now-iconic “Pickle Car” for the third year in a row. This year, the scheme made its debut at The Tricky Triangle...."
mz9kbj5,2025-06-23 02:56:44,en,REDDIT,"  I haven't posted in ages and have been reading a lot. Because of the entire state of the world I've just been on a mostly feel good book kick and don't see it stopping anytime soon. Summer Fridays by Suzanne Rindall: Sawyer suddenly finds herself with unexpected free time and a chance to hit reset. Set in New York City during those dreamy, half-day summer Fridays, the story follows her as she stumbles through career mishaps, new friendships, a bit of romance, and a lot of self-discovery. It's a charming, witty take on how sometimes the best plans are the ones you never saw coming. This was a great read. 4/5 Love Haters by Katherine Center: A sweet, funny story about a woman who really doesn't believe in love—until she starts falling for someone totally wrong (or maybe totally right?) . With plenty of banter, unexpected twists, and Center's signature reminder that love has a way of showing up even when you're trying your best to avoid it. This was a nice read, not super memorable but good. 3/5 This Bird Has Flown by Susanna Hoffs:  A romantic comedy about Jane Start, a once-famous pop star now struggling to find her footing after her one big hit fades into the past. At a low point in both her career and personal life, she meets a dreamy, slightly mysterious Oxford professor on a flight to London—and sparks fly. As Jane navigates awkward gigs, publishing drama, and the complications of a new relationship, she starts to rediscover her confidence, her creativity, and fame. This was written by musician Susanna Hoffs (of The Bangles) but she's mainly a singer, not an author so I'd give it a chance if you're looking for a little more than your average romance. 2/5 How to Find Love in a Bookshop by Veronica Henry (Audio Book)  Very cozy, heartwarming tale set in a charming English village bookshop. When Emilia returns home to run her late father's beloved store, she discovers it's much more than a shop—it's a sanctuary for dreamers, romantics, and readers of all kinds. As Emilia tries to save the struggling business, she becomes entwined in the lives (and love stories) of the locals—each with their own reason for finding comfort among the shelves. It's a gentle, feel-good celebration of books, community, and the unexpected ways love can show up when you least expect it. This was such a great feel good novel and I truly enjoyed all the characters. Highly recommend for anyone who needs wants a nice cozy read. 5/5 The Lodge by Kayla Olson: Alix Morgan, a ghostwriter, retreats to a snowy Vermont lodge to write the memoir of a former boy band member, Sebastian Green. While uncovering secrets about Sebastian's past and the mysterious disappearance of his bandmate, she meets Tyler, a charming local ski instructor. As Alix and Tyler grow closer, she finds herself caught between her work and a new romance. Together, they navigate the challenges of fame, privacy, and opening their hearts. This was your basic romance novel. Will I remember it in a week? No. But still, I think this is a perfect vacation read and could easily rotate in to fill a book lull. 2/5"

Emmerdale's Robert Sugden finds himself in serious danger when killer John strikes and a few of Coronation Street's much-loved characters are left fearing the worst when a midsummer party goes horribly wrong. Over in EastEnders, horror strikes at the Vic when alcohol is served to the youngsters by accident, while Phil Mitchell is left injured. Hollyoaks, meanwhile, sees not one but two blast from the pasts for Mercedes McQueen and Karl Kennedy makes a big decision in Neighbours. For a first look at what's to come, we've got 25 spoilers to keep you enticed. EastEnders 1. Phil is struggling with Nigel, who leaves the house barefoot and then throws a pan of boiling water over him. Kat and Denise implore him to seek additional help, but will he agree? 2. Denzel agrees to look after the youngsters while the adults enjoy Patrick's birthday at The Vic, and it's not long before Joel causes trouble. The lads are served punch by Elaine, but they rush off with the jugs instead. As they enjoy their party, Raymond, Bert and Ernie knock back the alcohol… 3. Kat can't cope with cutting contact with Alfie during his trip to 'Australia', and when she tries to confide in Jean, she's quickly shut down. Jean still can't see past the fact she entered into business with Kathy and Harvey. 4. It's Christmas! Well, sort of. The Mitchells' half-Xmas celebration to lift Barney's mood turns awry when Nicola trashes the living room and Harry invites Zack along. Teddy agrees to support Barney if he wants to make a relationship with Zack. 5. Vicki is confused by some suspicious invoices in the Panesar accounts, but Bernie quickly makes some excuses for them. Ross encourages his partner to speak with Ravi and Suki, who track down Bernie and ask her themselves. Emmerdale 6. Robert makes attempts to intensify Aaron's jealousy, but his efforts fall flat. John is determined to rid him from the village and drugs him, and then stands over his lifeless body with a syringe. He's confused to wake up in the back of a van with no memory of what has happened… 7. Sarah is concerned about continuing with IVF when her own life is at risk, and is stunned when Jacob offers to be a sperm donor. She heads in for surgery, with Cain and Charity devastated when they learn that the operation hasn't gone to plan. 8. Belle tries to reason with Tracy over Nate's funeral, and when she feels like she's being accused of his murder, bans all of the Dingles from attending. Vanessa speaks with her sister, urging her to think twice. 9. Joe is panicked when he discovers that someone has stolen his autoimmune suppressant drugs. Believing Billy is out to get him, he decides that a 'replacement Graham' is needed to teach him a lesson or two. 10. Paddy voices his fears about Bear to Gabby, and she suggests that she may have dementia. Rather than broaching the subject with his dad, Paddy enlists Marlon to help him do an online test – but it could be harder than they initially thought. Coronation Street 11. Aadi hosts a party which quickly goes awry when Brody brings drugs. Nina and Summer knock back some LSD, and later, while still high, panic at the sound of sirens. The next day they retrace their steps following an incident, but will they find what they're looking for? 12. The DNA results come back, and Kit is confirmed to be Brody's father.

The airport marked the debut of this new flight with a special ceremony, warmly welcoming the inaugural passengers. To celebrate the launch, the first travelers received exclusive limited-edition postcards alongside their boarding passes as a memorable keepsake. This new connection will run twice each week, specifically on Mondays and Fridays, throughout the summer flight schedule. The service will utilize an Airbus A320 aircraft featuring a two-class cabin setup, with an estimated flight duration of about three and a half hours. Juneyao Air's addition increases the total weekly flights on the Shanghai-Vladivostok route to eight. Existing Russian carriers operating this corridor include Rossiya Airlines and S7 Airlines. Established in 2005 and based in Shanghai, Juneyao Air provides both domestic and international flights from Shanghai's Hongqiao and Pudong airports. MENAFN23062025000045017169ID1109708640"

Posting that beach vacation selfie while away could be putting the safety of their property at risk for theft because it also shares that their home is empty. The survey was conducted by Léger on behalf of Allstate Insurance Company of Canada ('Allstate') to explore how Canadians choose to share details about their vacation on social media before and during travel. Respondents to the survey reveal that 68 per cent of Canadian social media users plan to leave home for at least a few days this summer, with the highest rate among Gen Z and Millennials at 74 per cent and the lowest among those aged 55 and older. While 35 per cent of those staying within their province say they plan to post about their trip on social media, this proportion rises to 45 per cent among those planning to leave their province, and peaks at 51 per cent among travellers with international plans. Specifically, 9 per cent post before their trip to share their plans and 28 per cent post during the trip to show they are travelling. Young adults aged 18–34 are the most likely to publish content on social media during their vacation (39 per cent). Parents are more inclined to share (37 per cent) compared to those without children (30 per cent). In contrast, a majority (62 per cent) say their main concern is protecting their home from theft while they're away. This priority is even stronger among people aged 55 and over — 69 per cent choose not to post before or during their vacation. However, 15 per cent of respondents say sharing on social media is more of a priority than keeping their home safe from a break-in. Allstate has launched a public education campaign about the risks of sharing vacation travel plans online and how Canadians can better protect their homes. Allstate Claims Data Shows August is a Target Month for Home Theft Analysis of Allstate's in-house claims data over the last ten years reveals that property theft rises slightly over the summer, with August reaching a peak. Overall, the months of July through November are the busiest time for theft, making summer a critical period for home safety. As well, the claims data reveals Fridays rank highest for incidents, followed by Thursday, regardless of time of year. “While technology like smart cameras and alarm systems may offer peace of mind, oversharing on social media can put travellers' homes and valuables at risk. I encourage Canadians to keep this in mind before sharing their travel plans and adventures online,” says Odel Laing, Agency Manager at Allstate Canada. “This doesn't mean keeping all the excitement to yourself, but rather share the photos of your vacation when you return.” Allstate Encourages to Travel Smart this Summer Odel offers some advice that may help Canadians protect their homes from theft if they are planning on travelling this summer. As a general rule, year-round, use your phone's privacy settings to remove geolocation data from digital pictures and avoid sharing images of your street address or home number. Before a trip, avoid posting countdowns. If the itch to share online is too great, create a smaller trusted chat group to keep those closest to you informed of your plans. Setting social media accounts to “private” rather than public allows more control over who sees your content. Even then, keep dates and other travel plans vague. Delay sharing details about your vacation adventure online until your return. Discuss this approach with all household members, so they take the same precautions.

Léger Poll Methodology Allstate commissioned Léger to conduct a study among Canadians active on social media to better understand their online behaviour before, during and after their vacations and assess if they are in line with their level of concern towards home safety. In order to reach survey objectives, an online survey was conducted with 1,603 Canadians, aged 18 and over, who could express themselves in English or French, from April 17 to 20, 2025.

For comparative purposes, a probabilistic sample of 1,603 respondents via web panel (including 1,352 respondents active on social media) would have a global margin of error of ± 2.45% 19 times out of 20.

Baker, Stephen Kingsnorth, Sayani Mukherjee, Shiva Neupane, and Joe Nolan —Public Domain Birds Courtesy of Joe Nolan     FLIGHT SCHOOL —Nolcha Fox, Buffalo, WY Icarus had dreams of grandeur, He wanted to reach the heights. He fashioned wings of wax and feathers. The birds were irked. They pecked out plumage, Chased him off the cliff. He hadn't attended their flight school, and so he was dropped. WHEN BIRDS GET TOGETHER —Claire J. Baker, Pinole, CA to gather their daily A-B-C's, they seem lively, yet at ease. Already nice, they already please. Birds, god bless, don't wheeze, don't complain of worn-out knees, or of needing slicker skis. Too high-strung for afternoon teas, too quick to fear bedazzled bees, birds crave rufflings from a breeze to swift off lice in twos or threes. BIRDS OF A FEATHER… —Stephen Kingsnorth, Coedpoeth, Wrexham, Wales See flocks which stay with their own kind miss predators, critical friends. Surrounded by plumage alike, we protect from diversity; this preservation of gene pool comes at the cost, creative whole. At race course and sports stadia, the crack house, skid row, refugees, bridge players trumped, cricketers stumped, alcoholics as meet, anon, communities, like-minded isles, we need more crossing of those aisles. Both dip, stoup, stoop, to pray and prey, the pilgrim and the sparrowhawk, these words for birds, wing and prayer are interwoven, breast to tail, as featherweight in boxing ring while featherlight speaks for itself. Now this an anapodoton, the main clause missing, but implied, an idiom, the rest assumed— those in the know to understand; birds of a feather fits the bill— as flock together, lesson learned. It features, art of rhetoric; it's heard atop the omnibus. It's written by the quill in hand; transcribed by keyboard, laptop codes. Device in conversation, books, an agèd idiom revealed. THOSE DANG SQUIRRELS —Caschwa, Sacramento, CA Growing up in the city I would occasionally see a squirrel. I heard tell from folks who professed to have a more worldwide view, that there were actually 2 kinds of squirrels: ground squirrels and tree squirrels. I believed what they said and henceforth held the common sense view that if a squirrel was scavenging about on the ground, that was a ground squirrel, and if it was up in a tree, that was a tree squirrel. All that worked fine until we moved to the suburbs, and each and every day I would observe squirrels first scavenging about on the ground, and then those very same squirrels would climb up into a tree, no problem. So maybe these squirrels I see in the suburbs are some kind of hybrid, which I will hereby denote as the “all terrain squirrel.” And that's all I know. HOW TO APPROACH A VOLCANO —Caschwa Is that an active or inactive volcano? She's a gal in the dressing room volcano, and she'll be ready when she's ready. Find something else to occupy your time, pal. Blue-Footed Boobie ANTI-DEPRESSANT —Caschwa (Digital Age Advice) A key element of Spell Check helping you avoid the frown you would get from the act of pushing the wrong button down         FAMILY —Sayani Mukherjee, Chandannagar, W. Bengal, India I live among the trees The lush greenery of global earth Moonstone of glowing night Monsoon is spreading its wings The Mayflower of seasonal changes God is among us Watching the children grow The Godspeed of everything Poetry music nature of dappled earth Family of flora and fauna. As I sip my morning June With coveted rain and blessing. Shiva Neupane at Parliament House (Birds of a feather hang out together— at Parliament House!) MY TRIP TO CANBERRA —Shiva Neupane, Age 5, Melbourne, Australia I saw kangaroos on my way to Canberra. I saw sheep on my way to Canberra. I saw bridge on my way to Canberra. I had visited to Parliament house in Canberra. WARM BUTTER —Joe Nolan, Stockton, CA Don't say “old,” Since after old Very soon Comes dead. Don't say a word That augurs Something we All dread. Don't say it. Don't say it. Don't even think it. Think instead Of bread, Warm and delicious, Fresh from an oven, Ready to slather With butter. Oh! To be so well bred That you always had bread And better, still, To have had butter To slather at will, All you want. Such dreams of youth and pleasure Surely keep spirits young. Think of the way warm butter Went dripping onto your tongue. MOST LIKELY —Joe Nolan Most likely There will be A sense of ending. Most likely There will be A sense of loss, When all The timbers Of trees Are shattered By bombs That have Flown across. Most likely You won't have answers To questions How no one cared Better than To destroy all we know As if destruction were bliss. MIGHT HE MATCH YOU? —Joe Nolan Which windy whirl Might arc and swirl Autumn leaves Down from their trees?

Lottabody's Coconut Oil Foaming Curl Mousse designed for all hair types to give you satisfyingly hydrated, volumized, frizz-free curls even at the height of summer humidity. A $4 miracle in a bottle if there ever were one! Promising review: ""I have super frizzy, curly hair and live in New England, where we have super humid summers. I have been struggling to find a product that de-frizzes my hair without making it look oiled down, and this is it. I put it in my wet hair after washing, towel dried, and put my hair in a ponytail to go to work. My hair was frizz-free all night — even working outside in high humidity. People even asked if I did something to my hair! This is an amazing product for the price. Absolutely buying again and would recommend to anyone with a frizz issue."" —Marissa ""My baby has curly hair, and since the texture is a lot different than mine, I have been trying out different products for her hair. I saw this one on TikTok and decided to give it a try. It is slowly becoming one of my go-to products for her! It does not leave the hair crunchy at all, and it moisturizes her curls nicely. Also smells good!"" —Heather Get it from Amazon for $3.98. 2. A set of DEET-free handy mosquito-repelling bracelets for the ultimate in genius summer investments — these use essential oils, including citronella, to help stop those teensy vampires in their tracks. Cliganic is a small business that specializes in all-natural personal care products. Check out a TikTok of the mosquito-repelling bracelets in action. Promising review: ""I moved last year from Southern California to North Carolina. Bugs of all types have always been attracted to me but the amount of bites I got last summer was WILD. Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and un-touched. Delivery was very quick so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hyper sensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive."" —Tracey Agopian Get a ten-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in larger packs). 3. Or if it's entirely too late for that, a delightful little tool called the ""Bug Bite Thing"" — it suctions on all kinds of bug bites to reduce swelling, itchiness, and redness. Bug Bite Thing is a family-owned small business established in 2017 that specializes in bug bite relief products. Check out a TikTok of the Bug Bite Thing in action. This works on mosquitoes, bees, wasps, biting flies, sea lice, and more (although TBH, if this list of bugs gets any longer I may just stay indoors forever!!) . Promising review: ""I cannot stress to you enough how much better this simple little tool has made my quality of life during summer in Ohio. It rains a lot. There are a lot of mosquitoes. I have horrific allergic reactions to mosquito bites. We're talking bumps swelling to the width of softballs within minutes of the bite. This tool doesn't make those bumps go away, but it stops the itch IMMEDIATELY. I was a huge skeptic; how could a little suction cure this agonizingly itchy allergic reaction? I'll be honest. I still really don't know how it does, but it provides instant relief that no pill, cream, or injection ever has ever achieved for me. If you live anywhere where insect bites are common, you need to own one of these."" —Customer Get it from Amazon for $9.95...."

mov_D63D27749B1DB20079D46EC58AFD56FD,2025-06-26 09:07:27,en,WEB,"  The traditional 40-hour workweek has long been the hallmark of American employment — but is it still the best way to work? With more people logging in from home, balancing family demands and prioritizing flexibility, the once-sacred 9-to-5, five-day structure is showing its age. “Nearly half of workers said they were interested in reducing work hours to a 32-hour week without a reduction in pay and workload, and 27% want flexible schedules where they could choose their start and end times [in a November 2024 survey],” says Vicki Salemi, a career expert with Monster. The Monster survey also showed that three out of four job seekers are more likely to apply to a role if it offers a four-day workweek. Still, some employers are hesitant to reduce weekly hours while providing full pay and benefits. Enter the compressed work schedule, a growing alternative that trades longer workdays for fewer of them. “A compressed work schedule means you're working fewer days,” Salemi says. “For example, you might work 10-hour days Monday through Thursday.” That frees you up for a three-day weekend every weekend. Though a compressed schedule may sound ideal, it's not the right fit for everyone. Before you commit to a longer weekend, here's how to decide if the trade-off is worth it. Why embrace a compressed work schedule For employees who want more control without sacrificing full-time status, a compressed schedule offers an appealing alternative. From extra time to recharge to real savings on commuting costs, here's why this alternative schedule is gaining traction with today's workforce. More flexibility with your days One of the most significant advantages of a compressed work schedule is the added flexibility it gives you. Whether it's scheduling doctor's appointments, tackling errands or simply enjoying a slower-paced Friday, having an extra day off each week can make it easier to manage life outside of work. That kind of breathing room can reduce stress, boost productivity during work hours and help you feel more in control of your routine. A recent Gallup poll found one-third of workers are fully remote and half follow a hybrid schedule. But even for remote workers, fewer scheduled days can free up time and reduce screen fatigue. Better work-life balance and higher job satisfaction By freeing up an additional day each week, you can significantly improve work-life balance and overall job satisfaction. You have more time to rest, spend with family or pursue hobbies — all without using vacation days. The American Psychological Association reports that pilot programs have consistently shown a shift to a four-day workweek improves well-being and job satisfaction. Save money on gas — and give the planet a break “Workers with particularly long, tedious commutes benefit most from compressed schedules,” Salemi says. In 2023, the U.S. Bureau of Transportation Statistics estimated that it costs $0.81 per mile to operate and maintain a vehicle. Using that number, a 20-mile daily round-trip commute costs roughly $16.20. Skipping one commute day per week across 50 working weeks saves you approximately $810 annually. Spending one less day commuting each week can also have meaningful environmental benefits. A study by Cornell University and Microsoft found that skipping the commute just one day per week reduces an individual's carbon footprint by 2%. Drawbacks of a compressed work schedule Packing 40 hours into fewer days can lead to unintended challenges — from longer, more exhausting workdays to logistical hurdles such as childcare or team coordination. Before jumping into a condensed schedule, it's important to consider whether the benefits outweigh the potential stressors. Workdays may feel intense A compressed work schedule doesn't mean you're working fewer hours — your time is just condensed. That can result in increased stress during the workweek. “It can lead to work imbalance during those four work days, such as less time and energy to spend time with family, workout, do personal errands or go to appointments,” Salemi says. Additionally, if everyone is working on a different timeline, a team might have some difficulty coordinating meetings or events. Burnout is a potential trade-off If your workload is heavy, compressing it into fewer days can backfire. ""If workers have an insurmountable workload, this can lead to burnout,"" says Salemi. ""Even though a longer weekend can help boost work-life balance, during the week, they may find themselves more stressed out with those additional hours."" For jobs that involve physical labor, stress and fatigue can also raise the risk of exhaustion or even workplace accidents. Childcare might be an issue Many schools and childcare facilities open and close at hours aligned with the traditional workweek. “This may not be the best scenario for parents or caregivers who need to attend to children or the elderly throughout the day or at least be at home around dinner time,” Salemi says. How to pitch a condensed working schedule to your employer If you believe the benefits of a compressed working schedule outweigh the drawbacks, consider presenting this idea to your employer. “Keep the business top-of-mind,” Salemi says...."

mov_BA2B502BE6A3384A5ABDEF9A185D1D90,2025-06-26 19:28:50,en,WEB,"  Published June 26. 2025 03:04PM Jim Thorpe Area School District approved a five-year contract Monday with Teamsters Local Union 773, covering custodial, food service and maintenance employees in the district from July 1, 2025, through June 30, 2030. According to board President Mary Figura, negotiations were productive and completed without issue. “I was part of the committee working on this contract with the union,” Figura said. “It went very smoothly and we were able to hash it out pretty quickly. I want to thank them for the time and cooperation.” The agreement lays out terms regarding wages, hours, job classifications, benefits, grievance procedures and other employment conditions for union members. Wages and hours Employees in the bargaining unit will receive scheduled hourly increases across five steps. For example, a custodian or food service employee at Step 1 will earn $16 per hour in 2025-26, increasing to $18 by 2029-30. Those at Step 5 will receive $23 per hour in 2025-26, rising to $27 by the final year of the contract. Substitute wages are fixed at $1 less than the lowest applicable step each year. Custodians will have the option of working either five consecutive 8-hour days or four 10-hour days per week, both with a half-hour paid lunch. Food service employees working full-time also receive a paid half-hour lunch break. The contract outlines a summer schedule where the district may shut down on Fridays. Employees who opt into working four 10-hour days will have any days off during this schedule deducted at a rate of 10 hours from their leave time. Those who do not opt in and are not required for events will only be paid for 32 hours during weeks when the district is closed on Fridays. Custodians called into work outside their regular schedule will receive a minimum of 2.5 hours of pay at the overtime rate. Overtime must be posted five days in advance and awarded by seniority. Health benefits Employees will have a choice among three health insurance options: Plan 1 has a $500 in-network individual deductible and $1,000 family deductible. Premium contributions for individuals start at $68 in Year 1 and increase to $85 in Year 5. For dependent coverage, the contribution starts at $111 and increases to $131. Plan 2 has a $1,000 individual/$2,000 family deductible with additional co-insurance. Premium contributions start at $25 for individuals and $50 for dependents in Year 1, rising to $45 and $70 respectively by Year 5. Plan 3, a Qualified High Deductible Plan with an associated Health Savings Account, starts in Year 2. The district will contribute 100% of the deductible in Year 2, decreasing to 50% in Years 4 and 5. The premium for employees under this plan is $35 per month, with retirees paying $100. Employees who decline health coverage due to alternate insurance may receive a $200 monthly buyout. Other provisions The contract establishes a grievance procedure with four escalating steps, concluding with arbitration if necessary. A lead custodian position will be established in each building, with a $1,500 annual stipend. Job descriptions will be created for all departments, including a new maintenance role to be introduced before the end of the agreement. The district agrees not to subcontract custodial or maintenance work until after June 30, 2025, but retains the right to subcontract food service operations to companies such as Nutrition Inc. Each full-time employee retiring after 20 years of service in the district is eligible for six years of individual medical coverage until age 65 or Medicare eligibility. Retirees contribute $100 per month toward premiums."
mov_0561EA1CCD95D8D595BDBDA79AA8F0B0,2025-06-26 20:23:58,en,WEB,"  Eight children have died in hot cars across the U.S. so far this year. In March, a 4-month-old who was supposed to be dropped off at a babysitter's home in New Jersey was forgotten in a minivan for two hours. On Sunday, a 4-year-old was found inside a hot car after being reported missing in Georgia. It's a preventable tragedy that makes dozens of headlines every spring and summer. Nearly 40 children die in hot cars each year, according to data compiled by Kids and Car Safety, a national nonprofit that fights for child safety in and around vehicles. Since 1990, more than 1,000 kids have died from overheating in a car somewhere in the U.S. In 2024, 39 kids died in hot cars, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), down from 2018 and 2019, when a record-breaking 53 children died in hot cars. Excluding car crashes, heatstroke is the leading cause of death in vehicles for children 14 and younger. The majority of hot car deaths happen because the driver forgets the child is in the car, according to the NHTSA. The federal agency has found that 47% of these deaths happen when the caregiver has forgotten to drop those children off at day care or school, and it usually happens at the end of the workweek, on Thursdays or Fridays. The second leading cause is when unsupervised children get into unattended vehicles on their own. “The majority of parents and caregivers are misinformed and would like to believe that they could never 'forget' their child in a vehicle,” Kids and Car Safety notes. “The most dangerous mistake a parent or caregiver can make is to think leaving a child alone in a vehicle could never happen to them or their family.” An average of 38 kids die in a hot car every year in the U.S. Why? Children who get trapped in cars suffer from pediatric vehicular heatstroke, which happens when the child's body temperature rises because of the internal temperature of a car. For example, if the outside temperature is around 70°F, the inside of a car's temperature will increase to over 100°F within the first 30 minutes. A child's body will overheat three to five times faster than an adult's body, according to the Columbia University Irving Medical Center. More often than not, caregivers leave children in hot cars by accident, which is why they're usually not charged with murder, David Diamond, a psychology professor at the University of South Florida, told Yahoo News. Diamond has studied cases of children dying in hot cars for 20 years. “These are not parents who don't care about their kids,” Diamond said. “Everyone can relate to forgetting. It's something that we all do.” Why do parents forget their children are in the car? Diamond says parents leave their kids in overheating cars because of habit and routine. The “habit brain memory system” kicks in when people perform repetitive tasks almost automatically or without a second thought. Diamond has said that knowing how to ride a bike or tie shoelaces are examples of habit brain memory. “You're driving home from work, and you've done it hundreds of times by yourself,” Diamond explained to Yahoo News. “It's your brain's habit memory system that takes you from work to home without even having to think about it. You drive straight home.” Even if parents feel confident that they will remember their child is in the back seat and needs to be dropped off somewhere before they get to the office, the habit brain memory system can overpower that new addition to a routine they've done hundreds of times without the child, Diamond said. He emphasized this is not a “syndrome” or rare mental disorder, but something most people experience because it's how the brain functions. It does not mean the parent or caregiver doesn't love their child. “'Forgetting' really is the right word,” he said of situations where parents leave their kids in hot cars. But “forgetting” the child because of routine doesn't alleviate any severity or pain from the experience for those parents. “It truly is a form of forgetting. And that's as simple as it is. It is a catastrophe."" Legislation could be the key to helping parents protect their kids Creating relevant safety laws is crucial to helping parents protect their children in these situations, Amber Rollins, director of Kids and Car Safety, told Yahoo News. Rollins cited data dating back to 1990 that shows children died less frequently from airbags while sitting in the front seat of a car after states made it illegal for kids under 13 to ride in the passenger seat. (It also wasn't required in all states for kids to ride in car seats until 1985.) But as more children were placed in the back seats of cars to avoid airbag deaths, kids were instead dying of heatstroke because they were forgotten in the car. From 1990 to 2023, 186 children were killed by overpowered airbags in the front passenger seat. During that same time frame, at least 1,126 children died in hot vehicles. Children can be unknowingly left behind in the back seat by even the most responsible parents and caregivers. Always remember to open the back car door after parking your vehicle and ""look before you lock."" (Kids and Car Safety Database, as of June 2025) This is why groups like Advocates for Highway and Auto Safety, Safe Kids Worldwide, the Juvenile Products Manufacturers Association and Kids and Car Safety are advocating for it to be mandatory for car manufacturers to build in radar systems that help notify parents if their kids are still sitting in the back seat. Part of the argument for why radar should be built into the cars — instead of tools parents can order online and install themselves — is, as Diamond told Yahoo News, because most people do not believe they would ever forget their child in the back seat of the car and wouldn't buy it. “The best kind of solution available right now is radar detection,” Rollins said...."

Kuumba Made is a small business that specializes in luxury scents at affordable price points. Promising review: This is my absolute favorite scent. I heard of this from someone I follow on TikTok and figured I would try it out. I fell in love with it the second I put it on. The scent is nice, not super strong, which I like because most perfumes bother my allergies. The scent lasts for a while. One bottle lasts me a few months. I recommend this scent to all my friends. I have tried other scents from this brand, but I think this one is the best. "" —rich allen Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (and check out the rest of Kuumba Made's scents for more options!) . 2. Lumify Eye Drops, a product so beloved by TikTok that despite being more $ than other brands, it's the number one selling brand on Amazon right now. Reviewers swear by this for instant reduction in redness in their eyes, with visible differences within a minute of use. Learn more about different kinds of eye drops and what they can do at Cleveland Clinic. Note that eye drops can potentially mask symptoms of eye conditions, so you should talk to your eye doctor about what's right for you. And according to Mayo Clinic, you should avoid redness-reducing drops if you're looking for dry eye relief. Check out a TikTok of the eye drops in action. Promising review: ""I have a big spot of blood vessels in the inner corner of my left eye. I use the expensive lubricant eye drops for moisture — I've used Visine, Clear Eyes, you name it.

Promising review: ""My new must-have! My number one go-to for healing lips was Carmex. This beat it.

mov_FE674FCEBC702A9009288A8BEF30F8AE,2025-06-27 13:37:26,en,WEB,"  Summer vacation planning can feel like a financial obstacle course, especially when Airbnb prices skyrocket during peak travel months. With accommodation costs jumping 25-40% in tourist areas during summer, and weekend rates running 20-30% higher than weekdays in urban locations, finding affordable stays requires more than just wishful thinking. “Most people approach Airbnb booking the same way they'd book a hotel, but that's leaving money on the table,” says Fred Harrington, CEO of Proxy Coupons, a platform specialising in discount codes and deals across various online services. With years of experience in e-commerce and deal-hunting, Fred has identified several lesser-known strategies that can significantly reduce accommodation costs. These methods work by understanding how Airbnb's pricing algorithm operates and how hosts make their booking decisions. According to Fred, the key lies in timing, communication, and strategic search techniques that go beyond standard discount hunting. Below, Fred reveals the specific hacks that can help you secure better Airbnb rates this summer. 6 Clever Hacks to Score Cheaper Airbnb Deals This Summer Negotiate Directly With Hosts for Off-Platform Deals Most travellers never think to message hosts directly, but this can unlock significant savings. After browsing listings, reach out to hosts through Airbnb's messaging system to inquire about longer stays or potential discounts. Hosts sometimes prefer direct bookings to avoid Airbnb's service fees. “Hosts pay around 3% in fees to Airbnb, so they're often willing to pass some of those savings onto guests who book directly,” explains Fred. “The key is being polite and explaining you're interested in a longer stay or repeat bookings.” Book Longer Stays to Trigger Automatic Discounts Airbnb's platform automatically applies weekly and monthly discounts when hosts have enabled them. Even if you don't need a full week, booking seven nights instead of five can sometimes work out cheaper per night, giving you bonus days at a lower rate. “Search for properties offering weekly discounts of 20% or more,” advises Fred. “You might discover that extending your stay by a day or two actually reduces your total cost while giving you more vacation time.” Filter for 'Entire Place' Listings With Fewer Reviews Properties with hundreds of five-star reviews command premium prices. Instead, filter for entire apartments or houses with 10-50 positive reviews. These hosts are often eager to build their reputation and price competitively to attract bookings. “New hosts or those with fewer bookings are usually more flexible on pricing,” says Fred. “They're building their track record, so they're motivated to provide great value to secure positive reviews.” Avoid Peak Check-In and Check-Out Days Fridays and Sundays are the most expensive days for check-ins in most destinations. Shift your travel dates to start Tuesday through Thursday when possible. This simple adjustment can save 15-25% on nightly rates. “Weekend departures also cost more because hosts know most people prefer to travel home on Sundays,” Fred explains. “Try checking out on a Monday or Tuesday instead for additional savings.” Search Neighbourhoods Just Outside Tourist Hotspots Instead of searching “Times Square” or “Venice Beach,” expand your search radius to include neighbouring areas. Properties 10-15 minutes away from main attractions often cost 30-50% less while still offering easy access to everything you want to see. “Use Airbnb's map feature to identify clusters of listings in adjacent neighbourhoods,” suggests Fred. “You'll often find identical amenities at a fraction of the cost.” Book Split Stays to Bypass Minimum Night Requirements When hosts require minimum three or four-night stays during peak season, consider booking two different properties for shorter periods. This opens up access to lower-priced listings that you couldn't book for your full stay duration. Many budget-friendly properties have high minimum night requirements that force travellers toward more expensive options. “Some of the best-value properties get overlooked because travellers assume they need to stay in one place,” Fred notes. “By splitting a five-night trip between two different  two–to-three-night stays, you can access properties that might be 30-40% cheaper per night than places willing to accommodate your full duration.” Fred Harrington, CEO of Proxy Coupons, commented: “The biggest mistake I see travellers make is accepting the first price they see on Airbnb. The platform's algorithm and host behaviour patterns create multiple opportunities for savings that most people never explore. By understanding how hosts think about pricing and occupancy, you can position yourself as the ideal guest they want to book with. “These strategies work because they address the real motivations behind Airbnb pricing – hosts want consistent bookings, positive reviews, and reduced platform fees. When you approach booking from this angle, you're working with the system's natural incentives to find better deals. The best part is that these techniques often improve your travel experience while saving money, giving you better locations or longer stays than you originally planned.”"
mov_9C5E54AF2A0DFECED888CBCEB28A8744,2025-06-27 14:52:38,en,WEB,"  Every December in Nigeria and Ghana a giant party takes place, unfolding in a whirlwind of concerts, festivals, weddings, art shows, dress-ups, meet-ups and travel. Locals and diaspora west Africans returning from overseas come together to create Detty December, a festive event stretching from mid-December to the new year. Detty is a playful term for “dirty” in the regional Pidgin language and “Detty December” is a term commonly believed to have been coined by Afropop star Mr Eazi in 2016. It means letting loose and indulging in some fun and revelry. Major events headlined by local and international music stars punctuate Detty December. In Nigeria events range from Flytime Fest in Lagos to Carnival Calabar, which showcases cultural heritage. In Ghana, festivals like AfroFuture and Afro Nation attract global celebrities and influencers as well as returning citizens. [embedded content] But this isn't just a holiday fling. Propelled by youthful energy and cultural innovation, it's an economic phenomenon. And it represents a shift in Africa's urban landscape and its relationship with the rest of the world. Detty December now stands as a pillar of Africa's creative economy, which has built on the global popularity of music from the continent, from Afrobeats to amapiano. As marketing and entrepreneurship lecturers with an eye on the creative industries, we've researched Detty December and believe it's a cultural tourism phenomenon with the potential to spread across the continent. In fact, it's already begun to do so. Nigeria: the economic power of Detty December Despite infrastructure challenges, places like Lagos are new cultural epicentres. During Detty December the city becomes a carnival of reunions and celebrations. “I Just Got Backs” (IJGBs) return, music spills from every bar and events pop up daily. Once simply a cultural moment, Detty December has rapidly become a powerful economic engine. It makes a big impact on hospitality, entertainment, tourism and local businesses. In Lagos alone, the 2024 festivities generated an estimated US$71.6 million in state revenue. Hotels contributed US$44 million and short-term rentals added US$30 million. [embedded content] Nationally, the impact is even more staggering. Detty December injected over US$220 million into Nigeria's economy in 2023. More in World A major driver of this growth is tourism. An estimated 1.2 million visitors flocked to Lagos in December 2024. Nearly 90% of these were diaspora Nigerians. Afrobeats star Wizkid's Made in Lagos concert alone pulled in nearly US$650,000 in ticket sales. New song releases on Fridays have become features of the season. Beyond direct spending, Detty December creates temporary and permanent jobs and bolsters small businesses. Ghana: December in GH The government of neighbouring Ghana has recognised this potential, strategically branding its festive season December in GH. This initiative leverages cultural tourism for substantial economic gain. The country even takes measures like visa-on-arrival in December to encourage visitors. This builds on cultural tourism successes like the 2019 Year of Return campaign. In 2023, December in GH reportedly attracted about 115,000 participants. [embedded content] Even in a challenging economic climate, Detty December continues to thrive. This indicates a desire for cultural connection and a much-needed escape, especially among the continent's youth and its global diaspora communities. South Africa: Ke Dezemba From Flytime in Lagos and AfroNation in Accra to Alte Sounds in Kigali and the vibrant December nightlife in Mombasa or Johannesburg's rooftop party events, African cities have become seasonal epicentres for cultural consumption. “Ke Dezemba” is a term used in South Africa to describe the festive season. It's a vibrant and celebratory term that's often associated with summer holidays, braaiing (barbecuing) and social gatherings. It could become the branding of the country's own Detty December. [embedded content] South Africa's global profile has been raised during its 2025 presidency of the G20. Adopting its own version of Detty December could continue to amplify Brand South Africa. It could show off the country's vibrancy, creativity, hospitality and potential for investment...."
mov_32F37F7C148461DE6CCC0A3188CF15FC,2025-06-27 16:06:15,en,WEB,"  As peak summer travel season begins this weekend, Vancouver International Airport (YVR) is preparing for an estimated 6.7 million passengers from June 15 through Labour Day. “That is putting us on track for one of our busiest summers on record,” said YVR spokesperson Alyssa Smith, who says the airport authority has been preparing for the crowds with new programs and systems to keep everyone flowing through as speedily as possible. CLICK HERE TO LISTEN TO 1130 NEWSRADIO VANCOUVER LIVE! “We have a curbside greeting program, which we piloted a few months ago, that is now fully operational. Right from the time you get dropped off and you step onto our curb, we have a number of our guest experience representatives outside who are able to answer questions or direct you to your check-in counter,” she told 1130 NewsRadio. “For our domestic passengers, we have a new security screening facility that we operate together with CATSA, which offers new technology. Travellers don't have to take off their shoes, don't have to take out their laptops, no liquids need to be removed.” Smith says that it will be a time saver for domestic travellers, but reminds that the 100 millilitre restriction on carry-on liquids is still in place. Once through security, Smith says passengers flying with Air Canada can take advantage of new technology to speed up boarding. “We are offering biometric boarding and biometric security screening. For those who opt in and are flying with Air Canada, you can simply walk right through security screening and right onto your flight. Everything is tracked through your biometrics, and you can opt in through the Air Canada app. It's a really big time saver.” YVR is predicting a near four per cent increase in passengers for this summer compared to last, and a one per cent increase over pre-COVID levels in 2019. Smith suggests there are also obvious changes in travel patterns this year as more Canadians choose destinations other than the USA. “There is an increase in travel across Canada. We are seeing, from our data, that more people are travelling domestically than they were before, as well as to international destinations,” she explained. Related: Peak summer travel season kicks off with BC Ferries full    Vancouver airport running at reduced flight capacity    Air traffic back to normal at Vancouver's airport after days of delays    Flights at YVR impacted by NAV CANADA 'resource constraints' “We also have a really busy cruise season as well, so travellers coming up through the U.S. or across Canada to board cruises here in Vancouver is another factor driving passenger numbers.” She says the top destinations for passengers departing YVR have remained consistent from last year. “It's Toronto, Calgary, and Edmonton. San Francisco is our fifth top spot. Last year, it was sixth, switching places with LA. Internationally, it's the same familiar favourites — Hong Kong, London, as well as Frankfurt, where many are connecting onward to Asia.” The busiest summer travel day at YVR is expected to be Friday, Aug. 8. “Fridays are among the busiest days for travel with the exception of this weekend,” Smith added. “It's technically not a long weekend, but we know a lot of people will likely take Monday off, and that is evidenced by that being the busiest day of this weekend, with Tuesday as the holiday.” She says the busiest times of the day at YVR are 6 a.m. to 9 a.m., 1 p.m. to 3 p.m., and again later in the evening. “That's when folks are heading off for longer-haul flights and the red-eye flights. Between about 7 p.m. to 11 p.m. is another quite busy period for us here at YVR.” As the busy summer season ramps up, Smith is encouraging travellers to arrive early and plan in advance.

mov_A52EF30D37FABF3CE2392F51212CC20D,2025-06-27 19:06:00,en,WEB,"  As farmers markets in the area get underway this summer, cuts to federal programs and rising costs are on the minds of growers in Northeast Pennsylvania. Cuts to federal funding for farmers market vouchers have some farmers concerned heading into the summer. Agencies that distribute vouchers to income-eligible older adults and young families learned this spring they will receive fewer vouchers than they requested, which officials said was because of the Trump administration delivering less funding for nutrition programs than Congress appropriated. Caryn Long Earl, director of the state Department of Agriculture's Bureau of Food Assistance, notified county agencies that they'll only receive about 74% of the vouchers requested for distribution through the Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program. The program provides income-eligible county residents ages 60 and older up to five $5 voucher checks they can exchange for fruit, vegetables and herbs at participating farmers markets and farm stands. The similar WIC Farmers Market Nutrition Program provides Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children recipients three $10 vouchers for use at the same places. WIC agencies will receive only 49% of their requested vouchers. State Department of Agriculture spokeswoman Shannon Powers said in an email earlier this month the state received less than 39% of the funding that Congress appropriated to distribute to WIC recipients through the Farmers Market Nutrition Program for the year. “The federal government has given no explanation or reason for the delay in funding,” she said. “Cancellations and delays of this and other federal funding streams, along with drastically reduced staffing at the federal agencies who manage funding contracts, have left the question of whether funds will eventually be received up in the air.” Logan Brace, co-owner of Brace's Orchard in Dallas, said the vouchers are a big part of his business. He estimates 30% to 40% of the farm's revenue comes from them and estimates the cuts could reduce that revenue to 15%. The farm sells produce at the Wilkes-Barre, Pittston, Back Mountain and Scranton Co-op farmers markets. “When you cut that in half, it makes a big impact,” he said. Brace, who is also president of the Scranton Co-op Farmers Market, has started to see the impact of the federal funding cuts in other ways, as he used to deliver food to the Weinberg Northeast Regional Food Bank every other week but now has to do so every month. “They have a lot less money to spend with the farmer,” he said. Brace said he plans to play it by ear this year and is hopeful the food bank will allow him to drop off food there more often. He said he understands there is wasteful spending in the federal government but the cuts shouldn't be put on the consumer. Gary O'Malia, owner of Larry O'Malia's Farm and Greenhouse in Plains Twp., shares similar concerns. He said vouchers are a large part of his business and could impact his plans for next year's growing season. More in U.S. “It's going to hurt if it's reduced,” said O'Malia, who has a stand at the Wilkes-Barre Farmers Market.

(JASON ARDAN / STAFF PHOTOGRAPHER) Expand The reduced funding means Eric Gillis, owner of Gillis Vegetable Farms at Windy Hill in Pleasant Mount, has had to find different means to sell his products — and has had to raise prices. He said vouchers account for 15% of his revenue. He said he will see how things go with the growing season but worries about the number of people who won't be able to buy produce because of the cuts. O'Malia is hopeful that more funding will be provided for the vouchers. “A lot of people depend on it and I think it's going to hurt a lot of people,” he said. Organizers of area farmers markets say they are working to help customers and vendors sell and purchase food. Mike Slusser, Wilkes-Barre's special event coordinator, said he received more calls from people who qualify for senior farmers market vouchers this year. This year is the first time people eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program can purchase vouchers at the Pittston City Farmers Market. Mary Kroptavich, Pittston's deputy city administrator and Main Street manager, is hopeful it will help people — particularly seniors affected by cuts to the senior voucher program — afford food offered at the market. “I'm hoping that can help the seniors that receive any other type of federal funding,” she said. “We have a lot of low-income residents here in the city of Pittston and to be able to offer this I'm sure will be a drastic impact for them too.” Kroptavich said sponsors also help at the market with free giveaways, and she hopes they will show up this year to assist the community. It isn't just cuts to federal funding impacting farmers...."
mov_1775ED2D9106DCB9943C3AD9F7DAD58C,2025-06-28 01:07:36,en,WEB,"  Advancements in technology are, for the most part, great. Take what I am doing right now for example. I'm sitting in a coffee shop using free internet that somehow is beaming its way to my computer. Full transparency, I have no idea how WiFi actually works or what the hell the difference is between any amount of G's. All I know is that I have a magic machine that puts the world at my fingertips nowhere where my fingertips are in the world. Such is the relationship with technology of somebody who remembers life before the internet. My kids do not have that relationship. It has been true of every next generation since there have been next generations, but my kids have only known a world with technology that I had to adapt to. I have to believe there were primitive parents out there telling their children that they didn't always have the wheel. You had to drag the animal carcass back to the fire, it took 13 hours to get there, and that's how it was and you liked it. The technology changes but the situation is timeless. Also timeless, is the parental idea that your way was better and your kids don't know what's good for them. Insert my kid's relationship with TV, and my relationship with that. Might as well be hieroglyphics My kids only know streaming. The idea that a show would only be on a certain day at a specific time that is determined not by them is complete nonsense to them. Telling them that Santa Claus picks what shows people get to watch based on where they rank on the nice list would make more sense to them. (Site Note: that is a genius idea to use to Santa to both manipulate behavior and to limit screen time. Two birds one fanciful stone.) It isn't like they need to wait for the next episodes of shows to be released either, because for the most part all the shows they watch are several years old. The only new they got into was “Wizards Beyond Waverly Place” and when they watched to the point where the new episodes hadn't been released yet, I'm pretty sure they thought that was that and they stopped watching. Which brings me to the worst part of how my kids watch TV – they watch a show to death. Like locusts moving from field to field extracting anything of sustenance or value from the land, my kids move from show to show latching on and devouring every episode over and over until no actual entertainment value remains. For the better part of the last year they have watch, re-watched, and watched again episode after episode of “Wizards of Waverly Place” and “Elena of Avalor.” In a world of nearly endless entertainment options, they watch two shows. Part of me is grateful that despite the vast library of content they have access to, they are content with a small portion. In a way, I appreciate their minimalist tendencies. Though in another way, what the hell is the matter with them? Not only do they watch the same shows over and over again, they watch the same episodes repeatedly. It isn't like they are cycling through the seasons, they go back and re-watch the same handful of episodes with complete disregard for any plot line that crosses multiple episodes. The idea that shows were meant to be watched in a certain order for the sake of the story making sense is lost on them. To them, entertainment options are self-contained bits of content. A single song, not an album. A single show, not a season. A single YouTube video, not anything that requires any context at all. If anything, the one they do understand comes in a series devoid of technology – books. Books come in series, and each book has a number. Baby-Sitters Little Sister and Dogman are numbered, and they understand when they have read one of them, they read a different one next. My daughter will spend a considerable amount of time on our library's website looking for the next book she can request, and will patiently wait days while it is on hold until she can check it out. This is in sharp contrast to the four seconds she spends scrolling through the Disney+ menu until she finds the episode of Wizards where Justin goes on the date and ends up kissing some guy's belly. Telling my kids about how I used to watch TV is the new walking to school up hill both ways. A badge of honor for the fortitude that only having seven channels to watch built in me. Though even my example of how good my kids have it is lost on them. They don't know what a channel is. To them Disney+ is a channel, Hulu is a channel, and PBS Kids is a channel. They only know this because when they ask for a show or movie that isn't on one of those, I tell them “we don't get that channel.” That is the only context they have for different sources providing different options. Otherwise, everything they want is always available all the time. I dare not even try to explain the Disney Vault to them, I would only be wasting my breath. The only hardship of my childhood entertainment that has now been thrust upon my children are commercials. A few months ago we changed from the ad-free Disney+ to having commercials, and oddly enough they seemed to enjoy this novel new disruption in their viewing...."

Blackbridge Community and Sports Hub in Podsmead, Gloucester, includes a fitness gym, studio spaces for dance, yoga and Pilates classes, a sports pitch, and a social space for community activities. A youth team offering support has also moved in and will host an open day and celebration later. ""We wouldn't have been able to do any of this in the previous locations where we were, it just wasn't feasible in the hall we hired,"" said head of youth provision Debbie Etheridge. Podsmead is within one of the most health-deprived areas nationally for people aged 16 to 64, according to the latest government data, which is from 2019. The Blackbridge Youth Work Team is offering regular youth activities and has a packed programme of summer holiday events. ""We're going to have a new session called Fit Fridays, so they'll be learning about healthy options, healthy foods, healthy lifestyles, which we do anyway for the over-14s,"" Ms Etheridge said. Lilly-Anne, 16, is one of the teenagers enjoying the larger premises. ""When we were back in the old youth club, we weren't able to do things like cooking,"" she explained. ""We just had a TV, but this is a massive place."" Bentley, 14, enjoys meeting friends at the hub. ""There are quite a few more things to do now we've got a bigger space,"" he said. ""We've got a pool table now, table tennis, and I enjoy the baking."" Ms Etheridge said the centre has had a ""dramatic effect"" on young people, but was also a great resource for all ages.

F583BB584735B6CB988308D531EB57D7,2025-06-28 08:35:30,en,PRINT,"  Movies The Porky Pig and Daffy Duck movie ""The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie"" is streaming on Max. Reviews were a little mixed, but mostly positive for the full-length animated feature. Bob Strauss wrote in the San Francisco Chronicle that ""the laugh ratio is more hit-and-miss than in the tightly scripted shorts, but enough jokes land to satisfy most funny bones."" The film had a wild ride to end up where it was originally intended, including a theatrical release in December not from Warner Bros. but Ketchup Entertainment (who will also distribute the previously shelved ""Coyote vs. Acme""). Mariska Hargitay's documentary about her mother Jayne Mansfield, ""My Mom Jayne,"" is also streaming on Max. The Hollywood bombshell died in a car accident at age 34, when Hargitay was only 3. La-la-la-lava, ch-ch-ch-​chicken, Steve's lava chicken is now streaming on Max, as is the rest of ""A Minecraft Movie."" A box-office phenomenon with over $950 million in worldwide ticket sales and counting, this movie adaptation of the popular game stars Jack Black and Jason Momoa. In his review for The Associated Press, Mark Kennedy wrote that ""the Jared Hess-directed action-adventure artfully straddles the line between delighting preteen gamers and keeping their parents awake. It's an often-​bananas adaptation, with bizarre digressions into turquoise blouses and tater tot pizzas. It has Jennifer Coolidge being very Jennifer Coolidge. Need we say more?"" Nicholas Hoult, Lily-Rose Depp and Bill Skarsgård lead the Robert Eggers-​directed update of the 1922 silent vampire classic ""Nosferatu,"" streaming on Amazon Prime Video. Jocelyn Noveck wrote in her AP review that ""it will chill you to the bone"" but that ""it may not terrify you."" Everything, she adds, in Eggers' ""faithful, even adoring remake ... looks great. But with its stylized, often stilted dialogue and overly dramatic storytelling, it feels more like everyone is living in a quaint period painting rather than a world populated by real humans (and, well, vampires) made of flesh and, er, blood."" - Lindsey Bahr, Associated Press Music What will the next era of Lorde look like? ""What Was That,"" the singer's first new single in four years, recalls the clever synth-pop of her 2017 album ""Melodrama,"" casting aside the folk detour of 2021's ""Solar Power."" The song that followed, ""Man of the Year,"" is stripped and spare - just Lorde and a sorrowful bass. Who knows what will come next? Listeners no longer have to wait as her fourth studio album, ""Virgin"" is out now. The ""F1"" movie, starring Brad Pitt and Damson Idris, is quickly gearing up to be a summer tentpole. Naturally, the filmmakers knew its sound had to be massive, too. That arrives via a score by the many-time Oscar winner Hans Zimmer and a huge soundtrack releasing as ""F1 the Album"" via Atlantic Records, the team behind the award-winning ""Barbie"" album - with bespoke tracks from Chris Stapleton, Ed Sheeran, Myke Towers, Blackpink's Rosé, Tate McRae and many more. The soundtrack is out now. Arty alt-rock legends Failure receive documentary treatment in ""Every Time You Lose Your Mind: A Film about Failure,"" available to stream on Hulu and Hulu on Disney+. The unorthodox and influential band finally gets its due in the project, directed by frontman Ken Andrews. And don't worry if Failure isn't a familiar name to you. Some of the featured voices in the documentary certainly will be: Paramore's Hayley Williams, actor Jason Schwartzman, comedian Margaret Cho, legendary producers Steve Albini and Butch Vig and many more participate. - Maria Sherman, Associated Press Television All 10 episodes of Season 4 of FX's ""The Bear"" have dropped on Hulu. Viewers will find out if Michelin-​starred chef Carmy (Jeremy Allen White) can successfully run an acclaimed and profitable fine dining restaurant in Chicago. The series has led to acting awards for White, Ayo Edebiri, Ebon Moss-Bachrach and Liza Colón-Zayas. Jensen Ackles stars in a new crime thriller series for Amazon Prime Video called ""Countdown."" Ackles plays a LAPD detective assigned to a task force investigating the murder of a government official. Eric Dane of ""Grey's Anatomy"" and ""Euphoria"" also stars. New episodes drop on Wednesdays. Ben Affleck and Jennifer Lopez's second shot at love didn't work out but there's another celebrity couple who has rekindled a past flame.

n09l19p,2025-06-28 16:44:54,en,REDDIT,"  I've had it since June 3. I was platinum before that. And therefore the first day when I logged in, I saw a few Platinum orders before the system caught up. They were turds. Absolute turds saying exclusive platinum orders. Preferred whatever it is. I'm fine with people telling the truth. If it's working out for them, great. But what you need to watch out for are the shills who were in here instantly. They were using scripted language. Saying specifically that it was like a weekend day or a Saturday on a Tuesday. And there were several of them using this exact language. So when you see that, understand that they work for Uber. Now I'll actually answer your question. Since my acceptance rate was single digits, after those first couple of orders when the system caught up, I was dropped to green. The first three days were kind of slow. But, it's summertime. Weeknights in the summer are always slow. That Friday I made $330. That's actually pretty outstanding for a Friday in the summer and my market. In general, so far, my income is about the same as it is in previous summers. Although last night kind of felt busier. I did pretty good again last night. But what I'm saying is that I'm green, and I've seen no negative effect. Uber claims that platinum drivers would be making 40% more than me. But if I'm doing $300 on Fridays, I don't see these other drivers making $400 to almost $590. More power to them if they do. I truly believe that we should analyze every order on its own. And only take profitable orders. If you feel like you have to take money losing orders in order to maybe get a higher paying order later, then I think your market is done and it's time to move on. I think it's not at all a coincidence that Uber is doing these wider rollouts on Tuesdays in the summertime. These are dead days. And they want you to freak out. They want you to go out Tuesday and not make any money, which you probably wouldn't have made anyway, and freak out so you'll start running $2 orders to try to get your acceptance rate up."
mov_6BBB306D490D7FC2221B9067A327FFE2,2025-06-28 17:21:00,en,WEB,"  CHEYENNE — The second month of summer is already almost here, with Cheyenne's biggest event of the year, Cheyenne Frontier Days, the Fourth of July, and eight new artists and bands hitting the Depot stage for Fridays on the Plaza. This year's FOTP theme is all about nostalgia and time travel, and the lineup reflects that. The summer consists of bands dating back to the 1970s, all the way up to the modern day. Courtney Sanchez, the booking and marketing manager for Cheyenne Presents, said they had put out some of the feelers for artists like Gym Class Heroes and The Wallflowers “years ago” and were finally able to secure them this year. “We've been sitting on the theme since last year, but felt it fit better with the 20th anniversary,” said Sanchez. “So, we started thinking about who the biggest players were in the different generations and across different genres throughout time. “That's always been the bread and butter of Fridays on the Plaza. (The music) represents everybody in the community, and we intentionally go after different genres and age groups to make sure we bring something for everybody.” Every Friday, there will be a free performance at the Cheyenne Depot Plaza, with the exception of the Fourth of July. In addition, there will be a Fridays Extended concert during CFD on July 23, beginning at 1 p.m. On show days, the artists typically arrive in Cheyenne the day of or the night before, and the Cheyenne Presents technical team starts setting up as early as 8 a.m. The Friday shows begin, rain or shine, with the opener at 6 p.m., followed by the headliner at 7:30 p.m. The previous opener for Hoobastank was Shotgun Opera, a Linkin Park tribute band. Due to scheduling conflicts, the band was swapped out with Denver-based band Moonpool. Sanchez told the Wyoming Tribune Eagle the crew all loves Shotgun Opera, and they'll “definitely be back.” “It's so neat to see how much we've progressed over the years. We've talked about getting some of these artists so many years ago, and to see them come here, and for that to come to fruition is amazing.” Here's the full lineup for the month, as well as a little bit of background on each of the headliners: July 11: Boys Like Girls w/Public Figure Garnering 3 million monthly listeners on Spotify, almost 1 billion streams and multiple hits on Billboard's Hot 100 is none other than the American emo-rock group Boys Like Girls. The band, which consists of vocalist Martin Johnson, drummer John Keefe, bass guitarist Gregory James and lead guitarist Jamel Hawke, formed in 2005 in Andover, Massachusetts. The group got started by posting demo recordings of their music to MySpace, leading them to earn the No. 1 spot on the website's Top Unsigned Artists chart. Within the year, they toured with other emo-rock groups Hit the Lights, All Time Low and more. More in Entertainment They gained mainstream success almost right off the bat with their first of four albums, “Boys Like Girls,” from 2006, and went on to tour for the next eight years. They made appearances on the 2007 Vans Warped Tour, co-headlined with Good Charlotte for the Soundtrack of Your Summer Tour in 2008, and have toured with Fall Out Boy and Metro Station. The group took an 11-year hiatus for members to pursue solo careers in between their third album, “Crazy World” (2012), and returning single, “Blood and Sugar” (2023). They did, however, go back on tour together in 2022, and performed at the When We Were Young Festival. They began working on their fourth studio album, “Sunday at Foxwoods” (2023), shortly after the COVID-19 pandemic, released three singles in 2024 and are going on tour to support the Jonas Brothers on their Jonas20 tour this August. Notable tracks: “The Great Escape” (2006), “Two is Better Than One” feat. Taylor Swift (2009), “Love Drunk” (2009). July 18: Digital Underground w/Real Deal Music One of the older groups in the Fridays lineup this summer is Digital Underground. The alternative hip-hop group from Oakland, California, was formed by rapper Gregory “Shock G” Jacobs, DJ Kenneth “Kenny K” Waters and Jimi “Chopmaster J” Dright. Through the years, the funk R&B group added five more members, including the late rapper Tupac “2Pac” Shakur, and current members Money B and Young Hump. Digital Underground became known for sampling songs from various funk bands they were influenced by and gained massive popularity with the Billboard Top 10 hit “The Humpty Dance” (1990). They've toured nearly every year since 2008, and although founding member Shock-G died in 2021, Money B and Young Hump still continue to tour. To date, Money B and Shock G are the only two members that have been featured on every album. The group released six albums from 1990 to 2008, with their latest being “...Cuz a D.U. Party Don't Stop.” They also released an EP in 2010 called “The Greenlight EP,” which contains unreleased tracks. In honor of Shock G, the band released four singles to showcase his piano under the name Solo Piano Group in 2022. Money B, along with many of the past members, still releases solo music. Notable tracks: “The Humpty Dance” (1990), “Same Song” (2005), “Freaks of the Industry” (1990). July 23: The Burroughs w/Third Rail This is an extra concert taking place in the middle of Cheyenne Frontier Days. The concert will begin at 1 p.m. on the Wednesday of the “Daddy of 'em All” with opener Third Rail and headliner The Burroughs. Third Rail headlined the Wednesday CFD show last year. The Burroughs is a nine-member ensemble from Greeley, Colorado. They've been active in the music scene since 2013, and brand themselves as makers of “sweaty soul music.” The frontman, Johnny Burroughs, cites Stevie Wonder and Beyoncé as their musical inspirations...."
mov_E3A1CB1879E37C65AE190B08B8AB656E,2025-06-28 17:21:00,en,WEB,"  Those in need of food, especially children with school out for the summer, have several options to keep food on the table, regardless of income level, day of the week and address. At a time when potential federal funding cuts to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) and other financial sources are being considered, those who fill gaps — food banks, school backpack programs, nonprofits and other food assistance programs — are doing all they can. According to Feeding Pennsylvania, about 1-in-8 Pennsylvanians experience food insecurity. Nationally, 14 million children are food insecure. Montour County Human Services Director Greg Molter said there is no reason for residents to go hungry this summer, as different services cover every week of the month. Eileen Anderson, of Watsontown, visits the Union County Food Hub at the Miller Center every week, a few hours ahead of the opening, to socialize with other people who are also waiting. Anderson said she appreciates the frequency of the event, the variety of food and the recipes and information provided. “It's been a godsend,” Anderson. “The price of vegetables is enormous. I'm retired and I'm only on a little Social Security. I'm working with next to nothing. I have to rely on food pantries, and a lot of them don't give fresh vegetables. This is just marvelous.” On Friday, state Agriculture Secretary Russell Redding echoed previous comments from Gov. Josh Shapiro that the state could not replace the billions lost in federal funding cuts. “Radical reductions in SNAP would hurt not only the two million people who receive benefits and may be temporarily struggling, but would also hurt the Pennsylvania farm families, and families of those in 12,000 grocery industry jobs across the state supported by SNAP spending,” Redding said. Food Hub WellSpan Health supports the food distribution efforts in partnership with the Union-Snyder Community Action Agency and several local collaborators at the Miller Center for Recreation and Wellness, 120 Hardwood Drive, Lewisburg. The Miller Center is financially supported in partnership with WellSpan Evangelical Community Hospital and Geisinger. The Union County Food Hub at the Miller Center was established in 2020 and has become a vital resource in the region known as the Food Hub. It hosts a free distribution of produce every Thursday from 4 to 5:30 p.m. from May through October through its Pop-Up Produce Stand. This weekly event allows individuals to select fresh produce for free that is donated by local farms, community gardens and local retailers. “A lot of our food access programs in the area struggle to have fresh produce like this available at every distribution because it's a lot of logistical work to work with farmers on a weekly basis, getting all the produce in, getting it packaged and ready for distribution,” Food Security Manager Rachel Herman said. “It's a full two-day affair of us getting ready every week. It helps ensure people have access to fresh, local produce that's not always available at other food programs. It's a supplement to increase healthy habits and healthy eating.” More in U.S. The Food Hub offers non-perishables and perishables available in a self-selection pantry for individuals in emergency need of food as well as information on other food resources in the area that we help community members get connected to for long-term food support. They also offer recipes and meal kits for the food provided. “It is really dependent on the growing season and what our local farmers and gardeners grow,” Herman said. “As soon as something comes in season in Pennsylvania, we usually see it here. Right now, it's very green heavy. We're starting to get leeks, cabbages and carrots, and cherry season is upon as well.” In 2024 alone, the Food Hub redistributed approximately 35,000 pounds of food to 37 distinct food programs in the region to support the community. The pop-up produce stand sees about 60 people every week. It has no requirements or registration, Herman said. In addition to the Food Hub efforts mentioned above, WellSpan works with Dreamcatcher Farm to welcome local elementary students onsite to harvest produce as part of WellSpan's Farm to School Program and the Fresh Local Food Project to help address food insecurity. Greater Susquehanna Valley YMCA The Greater Susquehanna Valley YMCA prepares and distributes food in seven locations in Northumberland and Union County as part of its Summer Food Program. “A lot of families count on breakfast and lunch when students are in school, so it can be a struggle to provide nutritious meals for kids in the summer,” volunteer Philippe DuBois said. “The Summer Food Distribution program provides balanced and nutritious meals for kids in the summer.” It's four days' worth of food every Tuesday and Friday at the Mifflinburg Community Park. The packs of food come with sandwiches, milk, fruit, juice, breakfast items and other items that kids would like, DuBois said. “Money is tight, and there are budget cuts at the federal level,” he said. “Everyone must register, so we don't waste food and resources.” Shalene Baker, of Mifflinburg, is a single mother of two. “I don't get any help financially from anybody. This gives me a chance to get them food they need and helps stretch out my money. It's also kind of fun for them. It's like a mystery, they get to see what they're getting. They get excited to go and find out what they have that week,” Baker said...."

Brian wasn't just the creative force behind The Beach Boys—he was a visionary who changed the shape of modern music. He taught us that pop could hold deep sorrow, spiritual yearning, and sheer beauty—all in the same breath. With his passing, we've lost a singular voice, but the harmonies he created still echo in our lives. Tonight, we honor his journey: from the early days of surf and sunshine, through the introspection of Pet Sounds, into the kaleidoscopic ambition of Smile, and finally his brave return in later years.

mov_1915AF188F5D87CD5DDA67C332D39625,2025-06-29 23:28:36,en,WEB,"  Nearly 70% of global professionals report feeling burned out at least sometimes, a figure that's steadily climbing. This isn't just a personal issue; it's a systemic challenge reshaping how we work. The recent move by Dubai and Ajman to implement summer working hours – including remote Fridays and reduced daily schedules – isn't simply a response to the heat; it's a bold experiment in future-proofing the workforce and a potential blueprint for global adoption. Beyond the Heat: The Strategic Logic of Flexible Schedules The initial reports from Dubai and Ajman detail a shift to remote work on Fridays during the summer months, coupled with a reduction in daily working hours. While presented as a measure to mitigate the intense summer heat, the underlying motivations are far more strategic. Flexible work arrangements are increasingly recognized as vital for attracting and retaining top talent, boosting employee morale, and enhancing overall productivity. This isn't about working less; it's about working *smarter*. The Productivity Paradox: Less Time, More Output? Conventional wisdom often equates longer hours with greater output. However, a growing body of research challenges this assumption. Studies consistently demonstrate that beyond a certain point, increased working hours lead to diminishing returns, increased errors, and a decline in creativity. The UAE's experiment acknowledges this “productivity paradox” and seeks to optimize work patterns for peak performance. Reducing the workweek can force prioritization, streamline processes, and encourage employees to focus on high-impact tasks. The Role of Technology in Enabling Flexibility The feasibility of widespread flexible work arrangements is inextricably linked to advancements in technology. Cloud computing, collaborative software, and robust cybersecurity infrastructure have made remote work not just possible, but often *more* efficient than traditional office-based models. The UAE, a regional leader in technological innovation, is uniquely positioned to leverage these tools to maximize the benefits of its new working hours policy. Expect to see increased investment in technologies that facilitate seamless remote collaboration and enhance employee monitoring – not for control, but for performance optimization. The Ripple Effect: Implications for Real Estate and Urban Planning The shift towards flexible work isn't confined to the office. It has profound implications for real estate and urban planning. As employees spend less time commuting to and working in traditional office spaces, demand for centrally located commercial real estate may decline. Conversely, there could be increased demand for larger residential properties with dedicated home office spaces, and a greater emphasis on creating vibrant, mixed-use communities that offer a blend of work, leisure, and residential amenities. Cities will need to adapt their infrastructure and zoning regulations to accommodate these evolving needs. The Future of the Five-Day Workweek The four-day workweek, once considered a radical idea, is gaining traction globally. Companies in various industries are experimenting with compressed work schedules, and the results are often encouraging. The UAE's summer hours initiative could be a stepping stone towards a more widespread adoption of the four-day workweek, or even more customized flexible work arrangements tailored to individual employee needs and job requirements. The traditional 9-to-5, five-day workweek may soon become a relic of the past. The UAE's proactive approach to flexible work isn't just about adapting to the summer heat; it's about embracing a future where work is more adaptable, more human-centric, and more productive. This is a trend that will reshape not only the UAE's economy and society, but the global landscape of work itself.

mov_EF0D517972BD4C58A259FCBAEC9474B4,2025-06-30 16:32:00,en,WEB,"  Manage your account Rory Sweeting, Portland Press Herald, Maine2 min read Jun. 30—Maine School Administration District 6, which covers the towns of Standish, Hollis, Buxton, Limington, and Frye Island, started its summer food program on June 25. School Nutrition Director Erin Miller told Lakes Region Now that, while the district has been part of the Summer Food Service program for a number of years, the way the program operates has changed, going from a congregate site to a non-congregate site. In the past, the school required families to eat breakfast and lunch on-site. As of this year, parents and guardians are allowed to simply come to the school and pick up to-go meals for their children. According to Miller, this was because the Department of Agriculture, which runs the Summer Food Service federally, has changed its criteria for being able to operate sites. The USDA website gives further details on the changes, which came about as part of the 2023 Consolidated Appropriations Act (PL 117-328), and allow for non-congregate meals in certain rural districts, including rural ""pockets"" within metropolitan statistical areas. MSAD 6 covers towns in Cumberland and York counties, which are recognized by the federal government as part of the Portland-South Portland MSA. AdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisementAdvertisement The district could qualify for the program either through census data or school data on free and reduced meal applications, Miller said. There is a tool called the Area Eligibility Mapper that uses census tracts and blocks to determine how many children in a particular geographical area would qualify for free and reduced meals based on information reported in the census, she said. While the census block where Bonny Eagle High School is located qualifies, with more than 50% of children in the area being eligible for free and reduced meals, none of the other schools in MSAD 6 do. Within the wider Lakes Region, the only other areas that qualify for the program are parts of Bridgton and Casco. Although the program operates out of Bonny Eagle High School, it is considered an open site and not necessarily limited to children from the district or who are enrolled at the school. Miller estimated that the majority of the children enrolled in the program were not enrolled at Bonny Eagle. As the program started up in its current form for the first time, she said it has had at least 225 kids sign up, and the fact that Bonny Eagle is able to operate as a non-congregate site allows more families access to the program. The MSAD 6 summer food program will operate from June 25 until Aug. 15. Participants can pick up food at Bonny Eagle High School on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays from 8 to 10 a.m. All meals are available free of charge to children ages 18 and younger.

mov_CD551C85C4149FEEA2CF5E4650C2D662,2025-06-30 17:51:30,en,WEB,"  “Bonds are forged through shared adversity.” As an athlete, this statement aptly describes my collegiate athletic journey. The morning workouts my teammates and I endured still evoke a sense of trepidation within me, and I often wake up in a cold sweat, fearing I am tardy for a morning run at the stadium. These habits may take time to dissipate, but one thing remains unwavering: the unbreakable bond I shared with my teammates during those grueling mornings. The echoes of their encouraging voices resound in my mind as I pushed my body to the brink, striving to complete a 300-meter shuttle within the stipulated time frame. The exhaustion that overcame me was palpable, yet I found the strength to persevere, driven by the knowledge that my teammates were equally struggling but resolute in their pursuit of victory. The profound sense of accomplishment experienced on Fridays during the summer, when we collectively overcome the final, arduous lift of the week, is unparalleled. This feeling is even more intense when the fruits of our labor translate into a triumph on the gridiron during the season. These emotions are difficult to articulate, yet the upcoming generation of college athletes may miss out on the authentic experience of college athletics due to the emergence of a novel dynamic. Name, Image, and Likeness (NIL) presents a unique opportunity for college athletes, both past, present, and future. The potential to monetize oneself and receive compensation for one's contributions to a program is long overdue, and I wholeheartedly support this development. However, as with any decision, there are inherent advantages and disadvantages. The emergence of the NIL era will undoubtedly challenge student-athletes' commitments and reveal their true values during their college years. While this development may not align with the traditional model, it is likely that many student-athletes will prioritize NIL payments and the financial benefits offered by institutions over other considerations. The introduction of new transfer portal rules and the direct payments made by NCAA schools to players will further exacerbate this trend. Consequently, it is possible that players will increasingly leave their committed schools for those that provide greater monetary compensation. Payouts will not be the sole reason individuals will leave educational institutions. Many student-athletes will also prioritize playing time, seeking opportunities to play automatically. While this may not appear detrimental, athletes prioritizing playing time over other factors has been a common practice for years. However, the new regulations have significantly complicated the transfer process compared to previous years. With the restrictions on transfer portals being lifted and the introduction of regulations that permit virtually unlimited transfers, genuine commitments to schools will become increasingly rare. Many student-athletes dissatisfied with their current circumstances (inadequate playing time, desire for enhanced media coverage, or dissatisfaction with the program) may choose to enter the transfer portal. Unfortunately, they may not be selected or end up attending a school that is not as favorable as their previous institution. Regrettably, this is the reality faced by many student-athletes, and the situation is likely to deteriorate until new regulations are implemented. In light of the growing reasons for student-athletes to leave their committed institutions, it is crucial to consider the factors that retain them. The primary reason for athlete retention lies in the strong bonds they form with their teammates. Team chemistry is a pivotal aspect of any team's success, and the relationships student-athletes develop with their peers irrevocably shape their college experiences. True, enduring bonds are forged through shared adversity and strengthened through repeated challenges. In this new era, I predict that the most successful coaches will not be those who invest heavily in recruitment or rely solely on transfer portal experience. Instead, they will be those who provide a fulfilling and enriching experience for their athletes. By fostering team interactions and building a foundation of trust and camaraderie, these coaches will create an environment where student-athletes feel valued and motivated to stay, regardless of the financial implications. As a former athlete, I offer counsel to those embarking on the NIL era or nearing it: prior to engaging in negotiations with college coaches, introspect on your aspirations for the institution you intend to join. Identify your primary objectives. Related: BYU QB Jake Retzlaff to Enter Transfer Portal, Per Reports Are you seeking financial compensation through NIL deals? Aspiring to attain fame and recognition through televised appearances in a prominent program? Or are you seeking a second home away from home, an environment conducive to skill development and surrounded by individuals willing to provide the necessary resources? Are you aiming for the next level of success, and if so, which institution would best position you not only for athletic triumph but also for overall personal growth? Related: NIL Struggles Far From Over After NCAA's House Settlement Personally, I value athletic, academic, and social success, and the principles I upheld guided me to my current path. Ensure that the path you choose aligns with your aspirations and will leave you with a sense of pride upon reflection.

The company I work for does half day Fridays all summer long so I get quite a bit of extra reading time during those months. I read 22 books in June. Most were arcs but I also added two pretty thick books off my physical TBR, Quicksilver and Binding 13. With the exception of one book I DNFed after starting it three different times throughout the month and giving up each time, I really enjoyed everything I read, so I'd say it was a pretty good month. My photo features all of the physical copies I read, but I also read a few e-arcs and listened to several audiobooks as well. I got into such a groove with my reading that I got behind on my reviews so several of these reviews will be posting throughout the week. ❓QOTD:  How was your reading month?

1losiox,2025-07-01 04:23:40,en,REDDIT,"  I searched (self exit, killing yourself) This is long, and I get ignored alot. So I don't think anyone is reading this. But maybe a little autobiography won't hurt if it's only me who reads it. I am 18(F). And I do not have any will to live anymore. I just had a fight with my mother. And Honestly this was my last straw. Since childhood. My family had named me the angry child, expensive child, narcissistic, God complex, fat, selfish Yara Yara. Now I dont want to potray them the bad way. My parents atleast, they are nice, they call me talented and maybe where proud of me at moments, but obviously they don't want to feed my ego. I was bullied since the age of maybe 7-9 till my teen hoods, by my friends. Bags and bottles broken, called stuffs and rumours here and there. Never really hurt me in a way although I did start self harm and I did try to self exit back than. I remember one time, a boy called me names, and it hurt me alot so I cried in shower,  when my parents found out they were mad at me and asked me ""do you like him? Why would you cry over thay?"" I used to be good at studies, I used to play guitar, do art, sing even got a certificate for 7 years of classical dancing. I have Two bunnies I adore alot and 3 dogs i love more than my life although at this point i love anything more than my life and a cat who's the only thing that's stopping me from cutting my throat open. Although am scared that will hurt like fuck. I have been suffering from jaw dislocation (tmj) for more than 8 years now. As I type this, it still hurts. In recent days it has gone worse. My head hurts, basic things like chewing and talking exhausts me. I can't even do a basic task without exhaustion. I had other medical conditions previously but eh. My mom akways loved my brother more, and maybe my dad had started too. They say it's not true, I hope it isn't true, but it sure feels like thay. Like, how when I Crack a joke it's offensive and how when my brother cracks the same joke it's funny. How when I talk back in a fight I am sensitive and rude but when he does he is smart and standing up from himself, how when I shut my feelings down I am sad over something a ""boy"" but when he does he has hard time expressing himself, how when I am sensitive I am being rude but when he takes something to his ego he is sentimental and overthinker. But either ways, I understand. My parents worked really hard to get where they are. They are the nicest people. Dad is so respectable and mom even opened a shop. Everyone loves them. I wanted to be like them someday. But maybe be better in some way if I could. That's how people around me probably look at me. Narcissistic. Maybe. Maybe not. Somehow I am the nicest person to my friends. And thay makes me feel good at times. I hoped I seemed the same was to my parents. I always wanted to be an architect,  I had started to save money although I had to use them for my pup's treatment, poor guy got into an accident. I wanted fo have a cute daughter and name her Chrysanthemum. Tuesdays were field trips, Fridays were movie nights and Sundays were hangouts, my parents don't take us out much, but I wanted my daughter to know me and to hangout with me all the time. I wanted to open animals shelters and a school just for the orphans and beggers, although it was all a fantasy, but I wanted people to feel wanted. I try to help people online as much as I can. It never worked...."

It pays to note that the stoves stay lit until midnight for that restorative lobster pasta with heirloom tomatoes before you call it a night. 47 Avenue B (East Fourth Street), aquarellenyc.com. The Paris Café Originally founded in 1873, this restaurant, a testament to the significance of the South Street Seaport, has been lovingly restored. It's also proof that the current appeal of foie gras terrine, snails, onion soup and steak frites is not new. The food is by Benjamin Wolff who worked at Racines NY, pastries are by Emma Scanlon, and the entire project is the work of Julien Legeard, the founder of Legeard Studio and Opus Hospitality, with a deep bow to the history of the place.

They're on Fridays til mid-August so if you want to go, sign up now! [cityofsantacruz.com/tours](http://cityofsantacruz.com/tours) There's a classroom portion where City staff goes over all the minutiae of what can and can't be recycled and answer all your burning questions about how much peanut butter really needs to be cleaned out of the jar. Then you get to tour the facility! You get to go inside and see the huge sorting machines, balers and the machine they use to pulverize our food scraps (which no longer feed pigs by the way). I really thought I was a Pretty Good Recycler (I read all the brochures I get in the mail, etc lol) but it turns out I was getting a lot wrong!! A few things I learned in case anyone is curious (this applies for the City, the County has different rules): * You can recycle those envelopes with the little plastic address window in them, you don't need to cut out the plastic! * Those blue and white Amazon padded envelopes are NOT RECYCLABLE. Though supposedly you can collect them and return them to a Whole Foods (who knows what loser Bezos does with them though...) * You can recycle your batteries at the dump or at City Hall (or other locations too). Don't bag them and put them on your curbside bin anymore * If there's even one patch of oil on your pizza box it has to go in the trash * If you do recycle a pizza box, rip it in half so workers know there aren't crusts inside. Otherwise it can end up sorted out into the garbage * No you cannot recycle any type of to-go drinking cup, whether compostable or clean plastic or otherwise. * There are tons of things that ARE recyclable, just not in your curbside bin. For example hard plastic chairs, hard plastic tubs, laundry baskets, scrap metal, is all recyclable if you bring it to the dump (and recycling drop-offs are free) you just can't put it in your curbside bin. * The City has a [$40 rebate program on compost bins](https://www.cityofsantacruz.com/government/city-departments/public-works/resource-recovery-garbage-recycling-sweeping/recycling-and-waste-reduction/home-composting-40-discount-progra) City staff was great.

This week, for the upcoming Billboard 200 dated July 12, we look at a loaded week of new and surging releases, headlined by returning alt-pop star Lorde and what's quickly becoming the summer's hottest movie soundtrack. Lorde, Virgin (Republic): One of the most anticipated pop releases of the summer has certainly been Lorde's fourth album Virgin, her first full-length since 2021's polarizing Solar Power. The album came with an extensive rollout, led by first single “What Was That” — which was debuted at a stop-start live event in New York's Washington Square Park (filmed for the song's official video, released later that week) and which became her first Billboard Hot 100 top 40 hit of the 2020s, bowing at No. 36. That song fell off the Hot 100 after just a few weeks, and none of the other tracks released in advance of Virgin followed it onto the chart — and the set has only 11 tracks and no feature appearances — so it's unlikely to be a streaming blockbuster, though it should still perform respectably on DSPs. It's also expected to sell well, helped by its availability for purchase in eight vinyl variants, including two signed editions — as well as being available on CD and for digital download. (The early critical response for Virgin has also been much stronger than the relatively mixed reception for Solar Power.) It should be enough to continue Lorde's streak of each of her studio albums making the Billboard 200's top five, and may better the No. 5 debut of Solar Power. It's unlikely to give her a second No. 1 album on the chart, however — following the No. 1 bow of Melodrama in 2017 — as Morgan Wallen's I'm the Problem continues to be an absolute streaming juggernaut, set to score a seventh consecutive week of six-digit units on the chart. KPop Demon Hunters Soundtrack (Republic): The greatest potential obstacle to Lorde's path to a No. 2 debut on the Billboard 200 may come from another Republic release, and one far fewer would have tabbed as such a charts contender. KPop Demon Hunters, the animated Netflix musical set in the Korean pop world, has become such a sensation since its release two Fridays ago (June 20) that its soundtrack — featuring the songs of its two primary fictional groups, HUNTR/X and Saja Boys, as well as a couple contributions from real-life K-pop stars TWICE — appears on its way to being one of the summer's biggest hits. The rising soundtrack already debuted on the Billboard 200 dated July 5 at No. 8, making it the first soundtrack to reach the chart's top 10 since Ariana Grande & Cynthia Erivo's Wicked accompanying set in January. And the set is still growing, up 220% in streams over the first four days of this tracking week (June 27-30), as its songs continue to scale the DSPs' daily charts — with the soundtrack now occupying five of the top 15 spots on Spotify's Daily Top Songs USA listing, and seven of the top 25. If the set continues to grow on streaming, it could not only crash the Billboard 200's top five next week, it could challenge Virgin for the chart's runner-up spot. And the album doesn't even have a physical release yet — it's only available for streaming and digital purchase at the moment — so if Republic could get a physical soundtrack together to tap into K-pop fans' investment in tangible products, the sky is the limit for KPop Demon Hunters' commercial potential. KATSEYE, Beautiful Chaos (Hybe UMG/Geffen): Speaking of K-pop — one of the biggest stories in the genre this year is of the global outfit KATSEYE, which encompasses members from not just Korea but the Philippines, Switzerland and the U.S., and sings in multiple languages, despite largely working within a K-pop framework. The group's approach has generated much discussion within various pop communities, and also a couple crossover hits: The group's singles “Gabriela” (No. 94) and “Gnarly” (No. 98) can both be found on this week's Hot 100. More in Entertainment Both those singles can also be found on the sextet's second EP, Beautiful Chaos. The five-track set contains contributions from behind-the-scenes stateside pop fixtures like Andrew Watt and Justin Tranter, and comes with a surfeit of physical options for purchase — including four vinyl variants and nine CD variants. It might not be enough to compete with the streaming power of KPop Demon Hunters on next week's Billboard 200, but it should be enough to further cement KATSEYE as a burgeoning force on the charts. IN THE MIX Russ, W!LD (Diemon): Billboard's 2025 Indie Trailblazer returned on Friday (June 27) with new set W!LD, follow-up to 2023's No. 12-debuting Santiago. The album should also be ticketed for a top 20 debut, as the 19-track collection has yet to produce any obvious breakout hits, but Russ' selling power remains considerable for an independent rapper — and W!LD is available for purchase in multiple vinyl, CD and cassette variants, some of which are signed. Barbra Streisand, The Secret of Life: Partners, Vol. 2 (Columbia): Barbra Streisand is one of the legends of the Billboard 200, having topped the chart a staggering 11 times in her career, ranging from 1964's People to 2016's Encore: Movie Partners Sing Broadway. Streisand's latest Partners duets set is unlikely to make it an even dozen, but should attract interest with its star-studded guest list — including modern-day chart-toppers Ariana Grande, Sam Smith and Hozier, as well as all-time legends like Bob Dylan, Paul McCartney and Mariah Carey — and is available for sale in a pair of vinyl variants, as well as on CD."

Since the Downtown Waynesville Commission cut ties to the event earlier this year, two merchants have led the charge to save the event and make it more inclusive of all downtown Waynesville businesses. For 25 years, Art After Dark has invited locals and visitors to explore Main Street through its art galleries on the first Fridays of summer months, but the tradition was at risk of disappearing this year. ""We have removed ourselves from the say of whether the event happens and how it happens. We will support it, but we are not going to be in charge,"" DWC Director Beth Gilmore told downtown merchants during a meeting in January. Jerry Jackson, owner of Salmagundi Gallery, and Tiffani Watts, manager of Twigs and Leaves, took up the reins and began steering Art After Dark in a more inclusive direction. ""Art After Dark was going to fall off the radar if someone didn't do something, so Jerry and I got together and said we're going to save this and make it better, taking in things we had heard from people downtown,"" Watts said. Merchants and galleries rallied in response to take ownership of the event, which provides a boost to downtown shops and restaurants. While the arts will still anchor the monthly event, the new vision also emphasizes Waynesville's food and beverage scene, retail shops, galleries and music venues. ""Years ago there were 15 to 18 galleries in town and it was much easier to say 'Hey, we're doing an art stroll that's more related to galleries,'"" Jackson said. ""There's so few (galleries) at this point that that's just not feasible, but there's enough businesses to make it a good experience."" Ideally, Jackson said, the event will draw people to town for more than just a stroll down Main Street. He and Watts are working to engage as many downtown merchants as possible to offer dinner and shopping options in conjunction with Art After Dark, and they hope visitors may even be encouraged to stay overnight to participate in any of the area's many attractions and events. ""The more people that are open, the more enjoyable downtown is, the more people want to come and stay longer,"" Watts said. But, that collaboration is only possible if merchants feel heard and supported. That's why Watts and Jackson have held listening sessions and other meetings with merchants to understand their needs and concerns. So far, their engagement efforts seem to be paying off. ""A lot of people have been excited - they felt like nobody had ever really asked them to be a part of it,"" Jackson added. The event scored a $10,000 grant from the Haywood County Tourism Development Authority to rebrand and promote it. A website and social media accounts are being created to promote monthly activities, including artist demonstrations, live music, drink or dinner specials, and other promotions from participating merchants.

mov_F27C6A2C86FB376509E7D34A4FE85249,2025-07-03 07:31:21,en,WEB,"  The government of Dubai has officially implemented a temporary four-day work week for all its public sector workers. That could be us, but you playin'. Dubai's new shorter work week will now involve all government workers, who will be divided into two groups. The first will work eight hours per day, but get Fridays completely off. The second will still work for 4.5 hours on Friday, but will only need to be on for seven hours on other days. SEE ALSO: Microsoft Japan's 4-day work week boosted productivity by 40 percent Such changes will be in effect from July 1 to September 12, at which point Dubai's government workers will presumably be obliged to return to their usual five-day schedules. The four-day work week is part of Dubai's 2025 Our Flexible Summer initiative. You May Also Like ""This initiative demonstrates our firm commitment to enhancing the government work environment, making it more adaptable and responsive to the needs of employees and the community,"" said Abdullah Ali bin Zayed Al Falasi, director general of the Dubai government's human resources department. ""This supports Dubai's aspirations to lead in delivering flexible, sustainable, and people-centric government services."" Dubai's four-day work week follows a trial it conducted in 2024 involving 21 government entities. This experiment resulted in overall employee satisfaction increasing by 98 percent, with workers experiencing enhanced productivity and happiness. Yet despite these results, as well as positive outcomes from previous experiments by other organisations, it seems Dubai's government still isn't quite ready to commit to a more permanent change.

Numerous organisations across the globe have tried out shorter work weeks over the years, which have repeatedly reported positive results. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders also reiterated his ongoing support for a four-day work week last month, arguing that there's no reason workers shouldn't get a four-day work week if artificial intelligence is enhancing workers' productivity as its advocates claim. ""[A four-day work week is] not a radical idea,"" said Sanders. ""There are companies around the world that are doing it, with some success."" Companies which have tried it include Microsoft Japan, which announced in 2019 that its four-day work week trial had increased productivity by 40 percent. New Zealand firm Perpetual Guardian saw productivity increase by 20 percent during their own trial, prompting them to switch to a permanent four-day work week in 2018. Both organisations saw savings in reduced electricity costs as well. Iceland ran a four-day work week trial between from 2015 to 2019, and found that the almost 3,000 workers involved were happier, healthier, and more productive. A similar 2022 UK trial produced favourable results as well, with the overwhelming majority of participating organisations still operating on a four-day work week one year after the study's publication. Belgium also approved a four-day work week in 2022, enabling workers to request longer 10-hour days in exchange for one day off, while Japanese electronics manufacturer Panasonic introduced an optional four-day work week. Yet despite years of trials spanning the globe, resulting in mountains of evidence demonstrating benefits to employers as well as employees, the four-day work week still remains a rare model. Though it's popular for companies to portray themselves as forward thinking and at the cutting-edge, it seems few are willing to actually follow through and apply widely tested and scientifically-backed changes with clear proven benefits.

I am about to sweep and mop her bathroom and my reflex is to open the shower curtain. Don't ask me why but I've always been scared of a closed shower curtain. lol. Is it a lingering fear from watching horror movies as a kid? Did something happen to me in a bathroom and I repressed it? I may never know. But every time I am faced with a closed shower curtain, I inevitably open it. My son inherited this peculiarity. We both thought it was completely normal until we stayed with a former boyfriend. On one occasion, we were at my boyfriend's house and getting the house ready for guests. My son would use the bathroom, but only after he opened the shower curtain. The boyfriend would go behind him and close the curtain again so guests wouldn't see all of his shower secrets. I guess. This dance would go on a few more times until the boyfriend confronted us stating that our behavior was odd. lol What do you do that others find odd?"

(WRIC) -- Dinwiddie County and the National Park Service are enhancing heritage tourism by expanding access to the Five Forks Visitors Center and Park, starting this summer. According to a release from the county shared on Thursday, July 3, Five Forks begins a soft launch this July before a grand reopening on Friday, Aug. 1. This reportedly kicks off the site's First Friday's series, which is a monthly tradition going on from May to September, focusing on special programming and family-friendly activities. “We are proud to play a hands-on role in bringing Five Forks back to life for our community and visitors. Our team will be on-site to welcome guests, share the story of this historic battlefield, and ensure the Visitor Center is a hub of learning and engagement.” Quinell Henderson, Director of Parks & Recreation The First Friday will feature an outdoor showing of the 2023 animated film ""The Lorax,"" based on the children's book of the same name. This inaugural event is said to be ""environmental stewardship and community togetherness in a setting steeped in history,"" according to the release. The partnership agreement, which was formally executed in May after months of planning, helps expand access and increase historical education in the region, per the release. “This partnership not only breathes new life into Five Forks but also strengthens Dinwiddie County's commitment to preserving our past while investing in experiences that educate and inspire,"" said county administrator W. Kevin Massengill. Five Forks Visitor Center and Park, located at 9840 Courthouse Road in Dinwiddie, is open from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Friday through Monday, and from 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. on First Fridays from May to September.

Whether it's for the Curried Goat, Cow Foot Soup, Jerk Chicken Bites or Spicy Shrimp, more and more people are walking in the doors at the SaYum Jamaican Restaurant in Wilson. “Over the past 14 years, SaYum has gone to another level,” said Michael Bell, executive director of the St. John Community Development Corporation. The restaurant is operated in one of seven street-level retail units in the St. John CDC Wilson Renaissance Center housed in a redevelopment project across from the G.K. Butterfield Train Station. “We get a lot of traffic from the train station,” said Bell, who immigrated from Jamaica to Wilson in 2004. Most of the recipes prepared at the restaurant are taken from Bell's mother's cookbook. Armaleta “Pearl” Bell, was from Jamaica and died on Aug. 1, 2005, at the age of 67 in Royal Palm Beach, Florida. She was the inspiration for two books on Jamaican cooking through her association with Island Records. “My mother cooked for the Queen of England, the Duke of Edinburgh, Mick Jagger, Bob Marley, Grace Jones, Kool and the Gang,” Bell said proudly. Aliah M. Bell, 18, Michael Bell's granddaughter and a worker at SaYum Jamaican Restaurant, never had a chance to meet her great-grandmother. But there is a drawing of Pearl Bell outside Aliah's room at home. “She was very beautiful, I think,” Aliah said. “Every time I come out of my room, she's right there.” Now Aliah is spreading her family's Jamaican heritage through the food served at SaYum. “Just being able to meet her through her food since they are her recipes, I really like that because she cooked for a lot of people,” Aliah said. Now it is Aliah who is spreading her family's Jamaican heritage through the food served at SaYum. “It's truly awesome, especially seeing all of the personalities coming through from the train station,” Aliah said. “It is really a good spot. There are so many cultures that come in here just to try the food. Everybody comes in throughout the day.” Aliah said folks respond positively about the food, which is often spiced with fresh ginger, curry, garlic and turmeric. The meals are served with onions, beans, peas, beans, rice and cabbage and dressed with plantains and carrots and potatoes “It depends on if people want something spicy or mild,” Aliah said. Whatever the level of heat, the restaurant offers a wide variety of cool beverages made with pineapple, mango, orange, lime, lemon and other tropical delights. The restaurant serves something for everyone, even vegetarian dishes. “There is nothing like the bread when it comes out of the oven,” Aliah said. Some folks just stop by for ice cream to take the heat off a blazing afternoon. SaYum Jamaican Restaurant is located at 408 Nash St. The business is open 10:30 a.m. to 7 p.m. Tuesdays through Thursdays, 10:30 a.m. to 9 p.m. on Fridays and Saturdays.

Dubai's new shorter work week will now involve all government workers, who will be divided into two groups. The first will work eight hours per day, but get Fridays completely off. The second will still work for 4.5 hours on Friday, but will only need to be on for seven hours on other days. Such changes will be in effect from July 1 to September 12, at which point Dubai's government workers will presumably be obliged to return to their usual five-day schedules. The four-day work week is part of Dubai's 2025 Our Flexible Summer initiative. ""This initiative demonstrates our firm commitment to enhancing the government work environment, making it more adaptable and responsive to the needs of employees and the community, "" said Abdullah Ali bin Zayed Al Falasi, director general of the Dubai government's human resources department. ""This supports Dubai's aspirations to lead in delivering flexible, sustainable, and people-centric government services."" Dubai's four-day work week follows a trial it conducted in 2024 involving 21 government entities. This experiment resulted in overall employee satisfaction increasing by 98 percent, with workers experiencing enhanced productivity and happiness. Yet despite these results, as well as positive outcomes from previous experiments by other organisations, it seems Dubai's government still isn't quite ready to commit to a more permanent change. Is the four-day work week the future? Numerous organisations across the globe have tried out shorter work weeks over the years, which have repeatedly reported positive results. U.S. Senator Bernie Sanders also last month, arguing that there's no reason workers shouldn't get a four-day work week if artificial intelligence is enhancing workers' productivity as its advocates claim. ""[A four-day work week is] not a radical idea, "" said Sanders. ""There are companies around the world that are doing it, with some success."" Companies which have tried it include Microsoft Japan, which announced in 2019 that its four-day work week trial had increased productivity by 40 percent. New Zealand firm Perpetual Guardian saw productivity increase by 20 percent during their own trial, prompting them to switch to a permanent four-day work week in 2018. Both organisations saw savings in reduced electricity costs as well. between from 2015 to 2019, and found that the almost 3,000 workers involved were happier, healthier, and more productive. A similar 2022 UK trial produced favourable results as well, with the overwhelming majority of participating organisations one year after the study's publication. , enabling workers to request longer 10-hour days in exchange for one day off, while Japanese electronics manufacturer . Yet despite years of trials spanning the globe, resulting in mountains of evidence demonstrating , the four-day work week still remains a rare model.

Reviewers swear by this for instant reduction in redness in their eyes, with visible differences within a minute of use. Learn more about different kinds of eye drops and what they can do at Cleveland Clinic.

I use the expensive lubricant eye drops for moisture — I've used Visine, Clear Eyes, you name it. No eye drop has made my eyes look this great. Only Lumify!

I have really sensitive skin, so when I find something that works and doesn't irritate me, I stick with it. I returned to that store when I needed more and I could not find it, so I tried other stores and was not successful. I looked for it every time I went to the stores, and was still striking out.

Nigerian Dinner     If you fancy a spicy evening meal of freshly cooked Nigerian food — great news! African Meal Palace is now open at Mint Lane Café four nights a week, bringing the vibrant flavours of West Africa to Lincoln. The atmosphere is warm and welcoming, and the food is simply fantastic. Behind the dishes is Kemisola Obafemi, a Lincoln resident who brings her love of cooking and community together in a unique and heartfelt way. Kemi, who moved to Lincoln with her husband and children in 2022, is passionate about colourful, nourishing food that tells a story. “It all starts with a desire to share,” Kemi says with a big smile. “It began with inviting friends and neighbours over for dinner. I don't know how to cook small portions!” she laughs. “So they said — why not share this amazing food with everyone?” Now supporting her family's food venture, Kemi helps prepare a wide variety of traditional dishes that might be new to British palates — such as catfish pepper soup, yam porridge, Ofada rice (a traditional Nigerian rice), pounded yam with egusi soup, ogbono soup, bitter leaf soup, and dishes made with fermented locust beans. Some of the meals pack a fiery punch, but there are also milder options like jollof rice for those less familiar with spicy cuisine. Many of the ingredients are sourced locally through AdeLincoln on the High Street, while others are brought in directly from Africa to ensure authenticity and the perfect taste. African Meal Palace is open at Mint Lane Café on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays, and Fridays, from 4pm to 8pm — and everyone is welcome to experience this rich culinary culture. “The food is nice,” says Kemi. “And I just love seeing people enjoy it!” African Meal Palace is open at Mint Lane Cafe on Mondays, Wednesdays, Thursdays and Fridays, 4-8pm - all welcome!

In January 2025, the fabric and craft store Joann filed for bankruptcy for the second time in a year. They first filed in March 2024, but they went private and were able to keep all of their stores open. Not this time, however. Joann will be closing 500 of its 800 stores.

Jo-Ann Fabric actually had a pretty good last few years. With more people staying at home than usual, it was the perfect time to pick up a new craft, and many of those aspiring DIY-ers headed to their local Jo-Ann's to pick up the supplies they needed to create something beautiful. However, as things return to normal, the craft supply giant has been struggling. So far, it's been reported that Jo-Ann Fabric will close at least eight stores in 2023.

Stay up to date on Lower Columbia news, wherever you go Access the latest Lower Columbia news in The Daily News app that lets you select the topics that matter most to you. The June 20 event was cancelled because teens had been diving in the pool, which is too shallow to do so safely, and disregarding instructions from lifeguards the week before. ""People say there's nothing for kids to do, so we're trying really hard to provide a safe and supervised space for healthy physical activities,"" Manny said. Staff spoke to participants before the June 27 teen night, which did not have the same issues, she said. Due to the holiday, there was no teen night held Friday. The weekly events, held on Fridays, give teens a chance to swim, play basketball, eat pizza and play board games. Between 30 and 60 teens attend each week. At 60 participants, the teen nights are at capacity for the current number of volunteers, Manny said. ""We're not really looking to grow it,"" she said. Putting the events on costs around $1,500 per month, Manny said. The program is funded by grants from local organizations like United Way of Cowlitz and Wahkiakum Counties and partially run by volunteers. The front desk staff and lifeguards are paid YMCA employees. Manny said the YMCA planned to cancel the event last summer because there were other activities available, but the teens who attended requested that it continue.

The former local government worker has felt summers get hotter over her lifetime and says she “couldn't stand” such high heat herself. But like many who experienced Europe's first heatwave of the summer, Julie does not sound overly alarmed. She worries about climate breakdown for young people, but is not concerned about herself. She thinks more climate action would be nice, but does not know what can be done about it. She does not have much faith in the government. “It's like everything else,” she says. “I think it's all too little, too late.” As heatwaves engulfed large swathes of Europe and North America last week – the latest in a stream of deadly extremes made worse by fossil fuel pollution – green groups are frustrated that increasingly violent weather has not spurred the urgent support for climate action they had expected. Governments across the rich world continue to roll back policies to stop the planet from heating, while far-right parties that deny climate science lash out at environment rules even as disasters unfold. Their voters, while rarely climate deniers themselves, seem to tolerate their energetic attacks on environmental policy, if not support them. The views of someone like Julie – who declined to reveal her voting preference – sounded similar to what was seen across the country, said Ed Hodgson, an analyst at the research group More in Common who has run focus groups on climate action. Spectators at the Wimbledon tennis tournament in London try to cool down on Tuesday. Photograph: Toby Melville/Reuters Polls taken over the second-last weekend of June show most people in the UK found the previous week of weather too hot, are worried it will get hotter, and hold the climate crisis at least partly responsible. But the nonprofit also found the share of people concerned about climate change has fallen over the past year, dipping from 68% to 60%. Support for the UK's target to hit net zero emissions by 2050 fell even further, plunging from 62% to 46%. “The issue is really that there are so many other concerns now,” said Hodgson, citing the organisation's data tracking the top issues that people face each week. “Three years ago you'd have the cost of living first, then the National Health Service, and then immigration and climate – those two would compete for third place. Now, when we do those polls, climate is near the bottom of the list.” The contradictions are visible in towns such as Stanford-le-Hope, where Julie lives, which is among the few already represented in parliament by the rightwing populist Reform UK. A YouGov poll last month found just over half of Reform voters wanted a heatwave in the coming weeks. The party, which has promised to scrap the net zero target and “unlock Britain's vast oil and gas reserves”, is projected to win eight of the 10 most flood-prone constituencies at the next general election, according to an analysis in May by the NGO Global Witness and Round Our Way, a campaign group. Far-right parties across mainland Europe have been even more vocal in using the heatwave to take aim at climate policy, even as blazing wildfires force thousands to flee their homes and doctors warn of widespread excess deaths. Firefighters battle flames during wildfires on the Greek island of Crete on Friday. Photograph: Xinhua/Shutterstock In Spain, where the current heatwave brought a record June temperature of 46C, the Vox leader, Santiago Abascal, mocked a government promise to regulate fear-based advertising by asking if they were also going to “ban the propaganda of climate religion”. In Italy, which has limited outdoor work during the hottest parts of the day in most of the country, the Lega party MP Claudio Borghi said: “Climate change has always existed, the causes are anything but clear, and the solutions are contrary to what … is correct.” The planet's most important stories.

The post took a swipe at the World Economic Forum, the German public broadcaster and the Green party. The biggest political row over the heat erupted in France, where the National Rally figurehead, Marine Le Pen, called for a “major” air conditioning plan – one week after the party failed in its parliamentary push to halt new wind and solar projects. In an opinion article in Le Figaro on Thursday, the interior minister, Bruno Retailleau, a conservative, called to stop support for renewable energy and expand France's nuclear energy sector. Young girls pour water on their heads as temperatures exceed 40C in Berlin. Photograph: Maryam Majd/ The proposal earned rebukes from the ecology minister, Agnès Pannier-Runacher, who described it as “petty politics” that would write Algeria a check for oil, and the former prime minister Gabriel Attal, who called it an “incomprehensible” misstep. “As we endure several days of an unprecedented heatwave, we are witnessing a troubling resurgence of anti-science scepticism,” he said. Some far-right parties have focused their attention on old-school climate denial, while others have moved from questioning the science to aggressively campaigning against solutions. “I don't think the extreme heat is being weaponised, but the efforts to limit it certainly are,” said Ciarán Cuffe, a co-chair of the European Green party and former Irish environment minister. He added that Le Pen's call for more air conditioning – which he said should be one solution among many – may even represent a shift in strategy. “It's a recognition that these heatwaves are happening, and that they are extreme.” The paradox is that far-right parties bashing green rules are polling well above 20% in several European countries, even though the share of people who deny climate science is typically in single digits. In the UK, pollsters find just 6% of Reform voters list environmental policy as a reason for voting for the party, according to More in Common. That said, the level of threat perception among their voters is much higher than in other parties, said Hodgson...."

79111057_708,2025-07-04 23:44:57,en,WORDPRESS,"  ONE WORLD Q & A with World B. Free By Jay Babcock Grand Royal Magazine No. 6 [1997] Lloyd Free was raised in housing projects in the Brownsville section of Brooklyn as part of a large family. He was a child of the streets, and so was his fame. Endless hours were spent on the playground courts made famous in this past summer's feature documentary <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FjNCooPN7CA"">Soul in the Hole</a>, and Rick Telander's classic <a href=""https://amzn.to/405Dc70"">Heaven Is a Playground</a> (a chronicle of summer, 1974 at Foster Park in Bed-Stuy that remains essential to anyone was wants a better understanding of the inner city). In the streets, the best players had nicknames: Herman “the Helicopter,” Joe Hammond “the Damager,” “Fly” Williams. Lloyd's was “All-World.” Free made it to North Carolina's Guilford College, which he dropped out of after three years in 1976 to take a spot with the Philadelphia 76ers, just before Julius Erving arrived. Never a starter for the championship Sixers (who were overloaded with talent: Julius ""Dr. J"" Erving, Daryl “Chocolate Thunder” Dawkins, George McGinnis) but already infamous for his mouth and his predilection for shooting from anywhere at every opportunity. Free was traded to the struggling San Diego Clippers for basically nothing (a 1984 first-round draft pick, to be precise) after the end of the '77-78 season. Clippers coach Gene Shue let Free be free, and he finished second in scoring two years in a row behind George “the Ice Man” Gervin of San Antonio. Free was a sportswriter's wet dream, always eminently quotable and always opinionated: “That shot was so good, I thought I took it”; “I'm so good, even I can't stop me”; etc. Free had game too: flash, razzle-dazzle, jazz. He was a classic streak shooter capable of scoring 30 points in a half, a fan favorite, a short guy (6 foot 2½) with astounding vertical ability and a jump shot with such a high arc that it would leave the top edge of your TV screen—and then re-enter just in time to fall straight down into the basket, all net. While in San Diego. Free formed All-World Enterprises and opened a sporting goods store called The Free Throw. When Shue was fired, Free was traded to Golden State, where he had some success but was once again saddled with a team in the process of getting their shit together. ln any event, on December 8, 1981, Free went to a Brooklyn court and legally changed his first name from Lloyd to World. claiming that was what he was already being called anyway. When Free's career began to wane in the mid-80s, as he gained weight and his bricklaying increased, World ventured into the minor league United States Basketball League to get his game in order. He would emerge again to play successfully off the bench with Ralph Sampson and Akeem Olajuwon for the Houston Rockets in the '87-'88 season. Today World B. Free is a community rep for the Sixers, busy organizing summer hoops camps for youngsters and cheering on 76ers playmaker Allen Iverson. A publicist confides that he's always ""on,"" and indeed, when Grand Royal caught up to him recently, World was good-natured, eager-to-please and, as always, couldn't be stopped. He speaks expressively in different voices and chuckles to himself, with a cadence and delivery that reminds one of prime Richard Pryor on good (read: no profanity) behavior. Q: HOW'D YOU GET THE NAME ""WORLD""? A: This guy by the name of Herb Schmidt, he was the ""titlist,"" you would call him. He was one of those guys who'd see a guy who had an opportunity to make it out the ghetto, he would nickname 'em. James ""Fly"" Williams, Phil ""The Drill"" Sellars, Connie ""The Hawk"" Hawkins ... back then we had guys like that. He's the guy gives you names. And he called me ""All-World"" 'cause he thought that I had an opportunity. I was called ""All-World"" since Junior high school, yeah, when I was about 15. And the reason why I got it is from 360 slam dunks. That's how the name evolved. I haven't been called Lloyd since, really, and I finally made it. HOW DID STREET BALL IN BROWNSVILLE WORK? DID YOU JUST PLAY PICK-UP OR DID YOU HAVE TEAMS ... It was pick-ups. You didn't have no teams. You'd come out there, you'd pick your five, or if you're playin'' half court, pick your three, get the best you could and then you go with it, 'cause the wait's like umpteen years if you lose. [laughs] You don't wanna lose! WHAT ABOUT THESE TOURNAMENTS: SOUL IN THE HOLE, RUCKER... Rucker goes back since Julius Erving, them days. I played in it, too. Back then they were great. They had 'e, by the park, you had people all over the fences, you had the policemen stoppin',  you had the firetrucks, you had everybody in the Rucker projects. When they heard that the names were coming, anytime that they heard the names were gonna be down there, you couldn't get a fence. People say you couldn't get a seat? You couldn't get a fence...."

mov_5B0029575A5F0B019905B9FDA4FD4667,2025-07-05 04:06:16,en,WEB,"  Hi hi hoomans, it's me, Luna the Service Dingo, reporting live from underneath the kitchen table. Why am I here, you ask? Well, because tonight the sky was screaming again, and I don't like it when it does that. But the neighbors have been blowing off “bottles rockets” for days now… Usually, I love Fridays! It's my day to tell you all about my adventures, training wins, and Bear's latest grumbles. But today… things feel weird. Even Mommy said so. She's been quiet in that stormy-brain way all day, and the humans had that “big feelings” energy that makes me want to lean into them real close and put my head in their lap. We didn't go out and party, or wave flags, or say “Happy Birthday, America!” because… well, things aren't really worth celebrating right now. Mommy said that the president (who she called President… uh… Fluffup? Flopduck? I forget, I was distracted by Goldfish crackers) signed a bill that's going to hurt a lot of people like us- disabled people, sick people, people who already fight just to survive. I don't understand politics, but I do know how to recognize when the people I love are hurting. And today, that hurt was everywhere. So instead of fireworks and festivals, we had a quiet night at home. Bear and I got locked inside (RUDE) while Mommy, Mama the Moss Maiden, and our favorite Yard Yeti BJ played with sparklers outside. I saw them through the window, laughing just a little and trying so hard to make the night feel soft instead of needle-sharp. They needed it. I know they did. Dinner smelled amazing, by the way. Somebody super kind donated a steak to the food pantry, and Mommy made it fancy- with garlic and Worcestershire and lots of herbs. There were green beans from our garden (I helped water them and chase the bunnies away with Bear!) , buttery potatoes, zucchini, and mushrooms. We even got our own tiny bites of steak! But honestly? The best part wasn't the steak. It was the way Mommy and Mama and BJ sat at the table, leaning toward each other, smiling between the worry lines. I remember hearing Mommy talk about how she used to spend the Fourth of July once- about memories of summer nights on the lake. About Oma and Opa and fireworks that felt magical instead of dangerous. About a time when things made a little more sense. That's what we celebrated tonight- not the country, not the politics, not the broken promises. We celebrated each other. The family we've built out of pieces and pain and love. So, if you're out there feeling small or scared or angry- just like us- if the world feels too loud and unfair- you're not alone. Bear and I are right there with you, keeping watch, noses in the air, tails down but hearts strong. Stay inside. Stay safe. Don't let your hooman drink and drive. And please snuggle your pets. We need you just as much as you need us. Love always (and soft boofs), Luna Bean  https://linktr.ee/skylanarissa"
mov_8472FC5471AE096A3F73313EB765CC3B,2025-07-05 05:16:00,en,WEB,"  Many of us have enjoyed the attractions of North Wales' premier seaside town - but often when we were much younger. With the summer holidays coming up, I revisited Llandudno - dubbed the Queen of Welsh Resorts - to see whether they still have the same allure, and was pleasantly surprised. Llandudno has upwards of 2.8 million day visitors a year according to a Great British Tourism Survey from some time ago, giving the area a huge economic boost. On Tuesday morning, I started out at the Great Orme and drove to the summit car park. I intended to take a cable car ride but popped into the shop first for a mooch. Join the North Wales Live Whatsapp community now Biker seriously injured in Gwynedd crash with VW Transporter It has the usual fridge magnets and knicknacks but I was interested to see they sell a children's Fossil Dig Kit for £6.99, (marine invertebrate and coral fossils have been found in the carboniferious limestone hereabouts), a Llandudno seagull cuddly toy (£7.50) and mini bingo (£1.99) for the trip home. The adjoining summit cafe, with its hot buffet, was very popular. Then it was time to take a Great Orme cable car ride for the first time in years. You go around the back of the summit cafe and can buy a return ticket for £15 at a booth. Beware it's cash only though. Naturally, safety is crucial and aswell as a somewhat ambiguous sign warning customers ""Anyone standing up in the cable car may not return"", there were sandbags to weigh it down during the journey. With a gentle jolt, I was off, leaving behind the hubbub from the machinery. It's a nine-minute descent and I was impressed once again with the panoramic views of Llandudno Bay, Great Orme Country Park, disused quarries, St Tudno's Churchyard and Haulfre Gardens. The peacefulness and serenity were striking (I didn't look directly down), punctuated by an occasional, cheery ""Hello"" from the occupants of a passing cable car. I got off at the cable car station by Happy Valley (having to pay another 50p - not sure why) before walking around the building to get into another cable car for the returning ascent. I learnt there had been customers from Canada and Malaysia that day and I heard American, Irish and Brummie accents too. Clearly, Llandudno's cable cars are enduringly popular. On the way back to the summit car park I passed the Rocky Pines crazy golf course which I'd tried with the family years ago. It still looked fun and a woman was diligently hoovering the mini-fairways to keep them in tip-top condition. Next, I drove into town for a walk along Llandudno Pier - another attraction which has its seaside charms. I headed into the amusement arcade where I spent £1 at a machine to charge up a credit card-sized fun card. It paid for a chance to win a prize on a kind of mini-ferris wheel in a glass cabinet. There were Deadpool, Hello Kitty and Winnie the Pooh lamps but no joy, this time around. Wandering along the pier I was pleased to see a resurgent vinyl record stall - (Elvis Presley and Willie Nelson were among the artists), CDs and further along a Stormtrooper and Darth Vader figures. Of course, the squawking of seagulls is never far away in this town and at another kiosk fridge magnets proudly declared: ""I lost my sausage roll/donut/dignity to a seagull in Llandudno"". I thought I'd finish off with a lesser known attraction: Llandudno Chocolate Experience. I'd been here a while back but there is always more to learn. Customers get free chocolates of varying types - nutty, plain and milk etc - to be consumed at certain points on the trail to reflect how the taste of it developed. Display boards tell the story - ""Milk chocolate would not appear until after Henri Nestle invented powdered milk (in 1867) Daniel Peter worked out how to add it to chocolate."" And another board states: ""Chocolate was first officially sent as a gift during the Second Boer War to celebrate the New Year of 1901. Queen Victoria asked Cadbury's to make a chocolate bar for her soldiers, however this caused a problem. ""Cadbury's was a Quaker company and, as a result the owners were all pacifists. In the end they only branded the bars the Queen saw and the rest were totally unbranded."" The chocolate museum is open from 10am till 4pm Mondays to Fridays. (Admission up to £6.50). There's a factory beside the Llandudno Chocolate Experience and Paul Williams and the other staff are happy to explain to you about how chocolate is produced. It had been fun to revisit the attractions of yesteryear and to see they're still flourishing. The town holds happy memories for many and its enduring appeal is clearly attracting new generations of visitors too."
mov_B480DDFB727A9773A84A322DD344A378,2025-07-05 13:10:40,en,WEB,"  There's just something different about the way Sean Payton builds a team. It's not flashy. It's not numbers on a spreadsheet. It feels like it's written in ink, not in code. While some other front offices chase 40-yard dash times and TikTok clips, Payton chases the real football spirit. But why and where does it all start? Well, the answer is his High school! Like almost every football story. No stats. No stardom. Just belief. And somehow, that quiet chapter from a high school sideline still feels alive in the Broncos' locker room today. Still shaping the way his team is being built. To understand what Sean Payton really wants in his players, let's take a close look at the Broncos' NFL 2025 draft class. You'll notice a pattern. First-rounder Jahdae Barron from Texas. Second-round RB RJ Harvey out of UCF. Third-round WR Pat Bryant from Illinois. DE Sai'vion Jones (LSU), OLB Que Robinson (Alabama), P Jeremy Crawshaw (Florida), and TE Caleb Lohner (Utah). Seven picks, six of them stuck with one school their entire college career. No hopping around. No portal pit stops. Just loyalty! Why does it matter? Because in a college football world where over 4,000 players hit the transfer portal after the 2024 season, only 61%, per 2022 stats, find a new team. And that's why Sean Payton made a choice. He wants guys who stick it out. Who grind. As his old high school teammate Mark Bittner put it, Payton “like guys who didn't take the money and ran to another college as soon as they hit adversity.” That's not just a draft philosophy. That's his story. Benchwarmer. Backup. Underdog. Then starter. Then Super Bowl champ. And Denver walked the walk. PFF gave the Broncos high marks, especially for their Day 1 picks, and CBS Sports ranked their entire offseason fourth-best in the league. Deserved. Skipping through the shiny transfer names and betting on guys who stuck it out in college wasn't some dice roll, it was a very clearly laid out. A mindset. Less gamble, more gospel. The other offseason moves backed that same philosophy. Denver re-signed lineman Matt Peart, brought in running back J.K. Dobbins, added high-ceiling safety Talanoa Hufanga, and picked up tight end Evan Engram, who fits that reliable Drew Brees-era mold. None of it screams headline grab, and that's exactly the point. This team isn't chasing flash. It's stacking loyalty, toughness, and veterans who have been through it. This will make all the more sense when we dig into Sean Payton's high school roots. How Naperville Still Lives in Sean Payton's Coaching DNA We all know Sean as one of the most prominent football minds in the world...."

De acuerdo con un resumen elaborado por Newsweek y actualizado por USA Today, estas promociones no solo buscan atraer a los consumidores por el precio, sino que incorporan elementos temáticos, códigos festivos y beneficios exclusivos para miembros registrados en sus respectivas aplicaciones. Varias marcas activaron descuentos y beneficios exclusivos para usuarios registrados en sus aplicaciones móviles. Cadenas como Krispy Kreme, Sonic y TGI Friday's lanzan promociones y beneficios inmediatos para clientes vestidos de rojo, blanco y azul La reconocida marca Krispy Kreme ofrece el 4 de julio una dona Original Glazed gratuita a cualquier persona que vista los colores patrios: rojo, blanco y azul. Además, su colección especial ""Stars, Stripes & Sweetness"" forma parte de la promoción, reforzando la conexión visual con la festividad. En el caso de TGI Friday's, los clientes que decidan celebrar en el restaurante podrán disfrutar de un postre exclusivo: un brownie con helado coronado por una bengala, que se sirve únicamente en el local. Sonic, por su parte, ha activado su campaña ""Live Free Fridays"", que incluye un batido pequeño gratuito con cualquier compra realizada durante el 4 de julio. En tanto, 7 Brew lanza una oferta exclusiva para ese día: cuatro bebidas medianas por 16 dólares bajo su promoción ""fill-a-tray"" y una bebida temática llamada ""Firecracker 7 Energy Frozen Chiller"". Comidas temáticas, promociones 2x1 y productos gratuitos forman parte de las campañas comerciales del feriado. Plataformas como DoorDash extienden sus ofertas hasta el 9 de julio con alianzas clave con cadenas como McDonald's, Burger King y Pizza Hut Durante la semana festiva, DoorDash ha desplegado su campaña ""Summer of DashPass"", que incluye varios beneficios en marcas de comida rápida para los usuarios de su servicio de suscripción. Estas promociones estarán activas hasta el 9 de julio. Los usuarios pueden recibir ocho piezas de alitas boneless gratis en Pizza Hut por pedidos superiores a 15 dólares. En McDonald's, los clientes que pidan por la mañana recibirán un Egg McMuffin Meal gratuito en pedidos desde 20 dólares. Durante el resto del día, la misma cantidad mínima da acceso a una comida gratuita de 10 piezas de McNuggets o un Big Mac Meal. Burger King mantiene un 2x1 en su producto insignia, la Whopper, mientras que El Pollo Loco ofrece 10 dólares de descuento en pedidos por encima de 25 dólares. En bebidas, DoorDash incluye una promoción con Pepsi: por la compra de dos productos seleccionados se descuentan 5 dólares. Plataformas de entrega ampliaron sus alianzas con cadenas de comida rápida para impulsar el consumo durante la semana festiva. Códigos promocionales dominan las ofertas digitales en pizza, pasta y postres con descuentos válidos hasta el 7 de julio Mountain Mike's Pizza ofrece un descuento de 10 dólares en la compra de dos pizzas grandes con el código SUMMER25, disponible hasta el 4 de julio. Por su parte, Round Table Pizza incluye dos promociones válidas hasta el 7 de julio: 10 dólares de descuento en pedidos de 50 dólares o más con el código RTP704 y 7 dólares menos en cualquier pizza grande o extra grande usando el código RTP220. Fazoli's, cadena de comida italiana rápida, propone dos códigos para celebraciones en grupo: FIREWORKS25 para acceder a un combo familiar por 15.99 dólares, y BOGOJULY25, que activa una oferta 2x1 en fetuccine Alfredo. Peter Piper Pizza también se suma a las ofertas con un paquete familiar de 35.99 dólares que incluye una pizza especial grande, una pizza grande con un ingrediente y un postre de canela crujiente. Baskin-Robbins mantiene durante todo el mes de julio descuentos exclusivos para miembros registrados en su app: 2 dólares menos en bebidas congeladas grandes, 5 dólares de descuento en Polar Pizza y una bola de helado gratuita luego de una compra calificada para nuevos usuarios. Licorerías operan con horarios variables en función del estado, mientras supermercados y minoristas nacionales permanecen abiertos durante el feriado La disponibilidad de licorerías durante el Día de la Independencia depende directamente de la regulación estatal. Mientras que algunos estados permiten la operación de tiendas privadas con horarios reducidos, las tiendas estatales -conocidas como ABC stores- en lugares como Virginia y Carolina del Norte podrían cerrar completamente o cerrar temprano. Sin embargo, supermercados y grandes minoristas como Walmart y Target que comercializan bebidas alcohólicas suelen mantener su funcionamiento habitual, permitiendo a los consumidores adquirir bebidas sin restricciones de horario evidentes. La recomendación general es verificar directamente con los minoristas los horarios y opciones de entrega antes de planear celebraciones que incluyan alcohol. Por su parte, 7-Eleven ofrece una promoción exclusiva a través de su aplicación de entrega 7NOW: 17.76 dólares de descuento en pedidos superiores a 30 dólares usando el código USA2025, válido solo el 4 de julio. Los miembros del programa Gold Pass también reciben 10% de reembolso y entrega gratuita durante todo el día.

My mom is taking me to support to get a couple things like summer Fridays, but I don't have all that stuff and I definitely don't need all that stuff. I'll stick with my perfumes from Amazon."

I am a kid at heart, love Christmas, love playing games and am down to do something inconvenient just because it seems funny or goofy (one of the main reasons I want to get a doctorate is just to make jokes about it. The other is because it is a goal I have had since I was a child and I decided I am the kind of person that can stick with it and get it. Not there yet, still have a few years to go lol. Gotta finish my masters degree first, which will take me 2 more semesters.) I am fun motivated, but I guess more goal oriented than I thought. Fun is the primary motivation though. I don't think I dress like an ENFP, but maybe I do in a way I didn't think? (I love jean jackets, and have a really cool short sleeve jean jacket that has really good pockets and I wear that jacket all the time lol) I like RGB LED lights, appreciate black lights, loveee Christmas decorations (already mentioned Christmas lol), and I just realized I am doing the ENFP ramble essay.

CeraVe's Retinol Serum, which lives up to the CeraVe name and uses *encapsulated* retinol to reduce the appearance of scars and pores without flaking or redness. If you haven't gotten into retinoids yet or are worried about irritating your skin, this gentle but effective serum is a great option — and reviewers say they like it better than other more expensive options (like Murad's Retinol Serum, which retails for $92). And remember, like with any retinol (that actually works) *just do not use it every day. * Start slow and work yourself up if needed, paying attention to your skin. Promising review: ""I absolutely love this stuff! I saw a dermatologist on TikTok who raved about this product and tried it out, and it's been the most amazing stuff! It's helped my face to clear up very quickly removing all of the blemish spots and dark spots around my face. It's been one of the best products I've added to my face routine. This would be great for all ages/stages and for any weather types. It doesn't moisturize much, but that's not it's intention, and there is no scent, so I'd imagine it's great for all skin types and hypoallergenic."" —Successful Solo Promising review: ""I bought this for my teenager to use for his acne scars, but he ended up not using it. I ran out of my Murad retinol serum, so I gave this a try. I actually like it better than the Murad! It absorbs quickly, with zero smell or irritation. As with any retinol product, be sure to wear sunscreen when you're going to be outside."" —C. Munsterman Get it from Amazon for $18.68. 2. E.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter that reviewers say is comparable to (or even better than) Charlotte Tilbury's famous Flawless Filter. Apply this as a luminous, blurring base, mix it with your moisturizer or foundation, or dot it over makeup as a natural-looking highlight. It's formulated with hyaluronic acid and squalene for a boost of hydration too! Promising review: ""This stuff is so legit I've gone through three bottles. Adds the perfect glow to your skin! Sometimes I use it under foundation, and sometimes, I use it solo with a bit of concealer. I will never not repurchase it for the price and how beautifully it sits on the skin. This stuff is viral for a reason!!"" —mapagill Promising review: ""If you like Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Filter, this is leaps and bounds better! Just buy it. The coverage is better and makes my skin have the most amazing natural glow! The colors run with a more warm/yellow undertone, which worked great for me! Spend a fraction of the price and just get it; you will be happy you did!"" —Amazonreview Get it from Amazon for $14 (available in 12 shades). 3. And their Halo Glow Beauty Wand, a buildable liquid highlighter formula that delivers a majorly radiant, lit-from-within finish to your skin without lots of glitter (like Charlotte Tilbury's highlighter blush wands). The cushion-tip applicator is super easy to apply, too! One reviewer says it's an alternative to the Charlotte Tilbury highlighters! Promising review: ""We saw this highlighter in a makeup tutorial video online and thought we would try it. It was an easy decision to purchase it because the price was relatively low compared to other highlighters. It is worth every penny and more! I've seen this shade applied on different skin tones and it looks beautiful on everyone! Just the right shimmer, not glitter. It's gorgeous!"" —Joyinmyheart Get it from Amazon for $9 (available in three shades). E.l.f. also has reviewer-loved glowy blush and contour shades in the same wand design!..."

mov_FBA4E9A4C5612F0BD3429ABC545CF02A,2025-07-07 11:00:00,en,WEB,"  Amazon's four-day Prime Day sales event is expected to drive a record $23.8 billion in U.S. e-commerce sales this week, according to a forecast released today by Adobe. The sales will take place not only on Amazon, but on other e-commerce sites, large and small, as competing retailers join in on what has become one of the biggest sales event of the year. “Two Black Fridays” Worth Of Spending Adobe expects the spending over the event, which was expanded from two days to four this year, to be equivalent to two Black Fridays, in terms of online spending. Last year, consumers spent $10.8 billion on U.S. e-commerce sites on Black Friday, according to Adobe. Spending for the four day event is forecast to be up 28.4%, or $9.6 billion, compared to a comparable period last year, Adobe reported. Amazon announced in June that this year's summer sale would extend from July 8 through 11, twice as long as last year's two-day event. This is the first time the July Prime Day sale has spanned four days. The e-commerce giant also added another first this year, daily deal drops available for limited times while supplies last. This strategy is designed to hold consumers' attentions throughout the four-day sale period, and keep them checking their phones frequently for new deals. Mobile Impulse Purchases Will Drive Growth Purchases made on phones and other mobile devices are again expected to hit record levels, at an estimated $12.5 billion, or 52.5% of online sales, according to Adobe's forecast. Mobile shopping is a growth driver because more impulse purchases are made on mobile devices, Adobe reported. Adobe expects Prime Day-related discounts to be comparable to last year's, and range between 10% to 24% off. The biggest average discounts are expected in apparel, at 24%, followed by electronics, 22% off; televisions, 17%; appliances, 16%; toys, 15%; furniture, 14%; computers, 12%; and sporting goods, 10%. Use Of AI Shopping Tools Expected To Surge Generative AI-powered chatbots and other AI shopping assistants are expected to play a big role in this year's Prime Day. Based on the surge in AI-driven sales during the 2024 holiday season, Adobe is anticipating that traffic from generative AI sources will be up 3,200% during the Prime Day event. “While AI-driven traffic remains modest compared to other channels such as paid search or email, the growth shows the value consumers are seeing in leveraging AI to quickly find information on deals and product details,” Adobe reported. Sales driven by affiliates and partners - which includes social media influencers - is expected to equal 19.9% of revenue, according to Adobe, up 16.6% over a year ago. Adobe's data shows consumers are 10 times more likely to make a purchase after seeing influencer content, compared to social media overall. Using Prime Day To 'Trade Up' Adobe tracks online spending throughout the year, and has studied Prime Day events in particular as an important indicator of consumer trends and spending confidence. It analyzes direct transactions online, covering over 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites. Adobe expects, based on past behavior, that consumers are waiting for Prime Day discounts before buying big ticket items such as electronics and smartphones. Consumers also are expected to use Prime Day discounts to trade-up to higher-priced items, with the sales share of the most expensive goods expected to increase by 18% during the Prime Day event, compared to average levels."

Nadie la mencionaba sin decir cerra detrás. La frontera, cerra, tenía un fence largo de una punta a la otra con unos gates que nunca abrían, y eso que había gente de aquí chillando a gente de ayi. Mas fácil abrirla pa que charlen y eso, mejor no? Un tal Franco closed it. Sería un tio malaje. Creo que estaba cerra porque arriba se Pezzi's Steps (quien seria este Pezzi, y pa que le dieron unos steps?) decía 'With Britain til death do us part' y como sabia Franco que no queríamos ser part de Spain pues se cabreo y la cerro. Maybe también porque decíamos “British we are, British we stay” aunque la verda ni hablábamos mucho British between us ni miramos muy British tampoco, pero vamos, yo del United y quería que gane England conque that counts no? Po nada, la frontera cerra (igual perdieron las llaves no se?) Al final del fence largo…..Eastern Beach. Ayi íbamos en summer en el VW Beetle blue (pintao a brocha) que no arrancaba aveces con la humedad y teníamos que empujarlo. Se escuchana venir de lejos as we waited debajo de la cuesta de Pisani (donde mi abuela compraba comestibles y Henry la traía). En la playa la familia, los amigos, el sol, el mar, la sombrilla, los bolsos, el termo de té, las sillas, las toallas, la mesa, los drinks, los vasos, los gorros, la crema, la radio, y las palas. Con olas, los li-los red pa hacer surfing en plan Hawaii 5-0. Tambien el ice cream: el Carlos con el Flake, el Mivi, el Orange Maid, el 'family block' de 3 colores, el Choc-ice, el Fab y el Zoom (pa ponerte la lengua red como la napia del sol). Before long though, se acababa el verano, y venia el invierno…………… Si estaba el día feo, a ver TV un poco. Los Fridays el Un, Dos, Tres con la Ruperta y el Kiko, los Saturdays Mazinger Z, Heidi y Marco (“no te vayas mama, no te alejes de miiiii” – todavía no se si encontró la madre al final). GBC empezaba a las 5:30 y 3:30 los Sundays con Space Ghost, Banana Splits y the Monkees. Yo me chalaba. Pero con el día bueno…pal patio. El patio llanito. The place to go pa no dar la lata y para ver tus amigos. A place of equals…. em…. eso na-nay. En el football de patio, por ejemplo, el gorditio acababa de portero, los grandes de defensas y los demás a correr se ha dicho. El que traía la pelota era el captain cuando se shuaba equipos y se acababa todo cuando no se veía nada o cuando la madre del de la pelota abría las perisanas llamando “sube parriba ya”. Then it was “last goal wins”. Para mi, aparte del football, lo mejor era ir al cine. El regal 1 y 2, el Princes of Wales, pero numba wan el Queens Cinema. (Phone rings in Varyl Begg) “Hello” “Hello, ta Gerard?” “Si, quien es, Stephen? Gerrraaarrrrddddd, Steeeephennn” (era el Avelino.

Todos los shaveas de Gibraltar pal Queens para ver películas “U” or “A”. Fijo. “La cuesta cansa eh?” dijo el Costa. Una vez arriba, se ve que hay colon. Seguimos pal end del queue...."

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM=F) slipped 0.2%, while the S&P 500 (ES=F) backed off 0.3%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.5% as Tesla (TSLA) stock sank amid worries about CEO Elon Musk's plan to launch a political party. Stocks are pulling back after a strong jobs report helped boost the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) to all-time closing highs on Thursday, before the early trading shutdown for the long Independence Day weekend. With equities at record levels, investors are wary that any sharp turn in trade negotiations could trigger volatility. Trump said late Sunday that any country aligning itself with the ""Anti-American policies of BRICS"" will face an additional 10% tariff. ""There will be no exceptions to this policy,"" he said in a post to social media. The warning came after BRICS — a group of countries including key US trading partners China and India — criticized Trump's tariff policy at its summit at the weekend. It ramped up already-high trade tensions as nations race to clinch tariff deals ahead of Trump's self-imposed deadline of July 9, when his ""pause"" on steep April tariffs would go back into effect. Global markets have been bracing for that potential shock, with the US only having reached deals with the UK and Vietnam, as well as a framework toward an agreement with China. On Sunday, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent and Trump confirmed that while letters will be sent out this week informing countries of their tariff rates, those duties would not go into effect until Aug. 1. Bessent hinted at several possible deals in the coming days, suggesting the focus this week is clarity with 18 major trading partners before setting duties for the 100-plus other countries that the administration has in its sights for trade taxation. Earnings are coming back into the conversation this week, with Thursday's report from Delta (DAL) serving as the unofficial kickoff to the second quarter season. LIVE 9 updates Stocks fall amid trade uncertainty as Trump appears to extend tariff deadline Stocks opened lower amid renewed trade uncertainty after President Trump extended a tariff pause but issued new threats toward countries aligning with ""Anti-American policies."" The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) fell below the flatline. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) retreated 0.3% from its record high. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) dropped 0.5%, and Tesla (TSLA) shares sank as CEO Elon Musk announced a new political party. Comments from Trump sparked trade uncertainty over the weekend when he appeared to extend a July 9 tariff pause deadline to Aug 1. He also said late Sunday that any country aligning itself with the ""Anti-American policies of BRICS"" will face an additional 10% tariff. CoreWeave to buy crypto miner Core Scientific for $9 billion CoreWeave (CRWV) announced Monday it will buy crypto miner Core Scientific (CORZ) in an all-stock deal valued at about $9 billion. Shares of the Nvidia-backed (NVDA) company fell 4.6% just ahead of the opening bell, while Core Scientific stock dropped nearly 18%. Reuters reports: Amazon stock edges higher ahead of Prime Day kickoff Amazon stock (AMZN) edged 0.3% higher in premarket trading on Monday ahead of the kickoff of its Prime Day sales event. Online spending is expected to surge to $23.8 billion across US retailers during Amazon's four-day event, according to an Adobe Analytics forecast. Amazon extended the sales period to four days from two days. Reuters reported that sales from July 8 to 11 are projected to rise 28.4% compared with the same period last year. Online sales hit $14.2 billion during the two-day Amazon shopping event last year. ""This is equivalent to two Black Fridays,"" Adobe noted in the report.

Metals fall as Trump stirs trade uncertainty with BRICS threat Metals had a rough start to the week, with copper (HG=F) and other industrial metals extending losses after President Trump injected fresh uncertainty into his trade agenda with a warning to impose a 10% tariff on any country that supports what he called BRICS ""anti-American"" policies.

Coronation Street fans have begged for ITV to take action amid soap schedule changes due to sporting season. Over the last couple of weeks, the usual soap schedule has been thrown into chaos. And now fans have well and truly had enough of the long-wait. They've demanded that the channel comes up with a solution. Coronation Street schedule thrown into chaos Coronation Street usually airs on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays for one-hour each episode, between 8pm-9pm. However, the past couple of weeks have seen this usual routine be thrown up in the air. This is due to a summer of sport taking over ITV. The most recent episode of Coronation Street aired on Wednesday, July 2. And, the next won't air until Thursday, July 10 between 9pm-10pm. This gives an eight day break between Corrie episodes, with fans unhappy over missing their usual soap episode fix. Currently, the UEFA Women's Euros coverage is airing on the ITV main channel temporarily upheaving the schedule. Coronation Street fans beg for ITVX uploads for 'missing' episodes With episodes of Corrie usually being uploaded to ITVX and YouTube on the day they're due to air on the ITV main channel, fans are now begging for ITV to continue to upload episodes of Corrie onto these platforms as a replacement of the main channel episodes when sports are on. This way soap fans could still watch episodes on the day they're used to without feeling as though they're missing out. One fan on Reddit wrote: “I don't get it if they're releasing on the app before airing on ITV, why can't they on the days it's not shown live still put it onto ITVX? Hollyoaks used to do it if it wasn't going to be on a certain day it would still be available to watch on the app.” Another said: “I enjoy the women's football but surely they could put Corrie on later or just have the episodes available on demand?” A third person added: “There is no reason why the soaps need to stop. If ITV must show the Women's Football, then put the soaps on ITV2 at the normal time, and then air them later than normal on ITV.” Coronation Street usually airs Monday, Wednesday and Friday at 8pm on ITV.

FOR THE RECORDER/LUKE MACANNUCO “Jaylin in RED” by artist and activist Nayana LaFond. FOR THE RECORDER/LUKE MACANNUCO A wall of Nayana LaFond's portraits at The LAVA Center in Greenfield. FOR THE RECORDER/LUKE MACANNUCO A wall of Nayana LaFond's portraits at The LAVA Center in Greenfield. FOR THE RECORDER/LUKE MACANNUCO The painted gaze of Littlefox, a Native American woman from Minneapolis, follows viewers who enter The LAVA Center to view the arts venue's current exhibit, “Portraits in RED: Missing and Murdered Indigenous People” by artist and activist Nayana LaFond. Littlefox's portrait is just one of 19 in the exhibit, which opened at 324 Main St. in Greenfield on May 2 and will continue through the end of July. The 19 portraits are a fraction of LaFond's series, which looks to highlight the widespread yet overlooked violence that Native Americans face, particularly women and girls. A 2016 National Institute of Justice study found that 84.3% of Native American women experience violence in their lifetime. LaFond's portraits are mostly black and white, with red being the only other color included, often in the form of a handprint. “The red hand represents being silenced,” LaFond said. “It represents the blood of our people, but it also represents resilience and fighting back.” LaFond, who grew up in western Massachusetts and is a citizen of the Mètis Nation of Ontario, got the idea for the portraits during the COVID-19 pandemic. It was May 5, 2020 — which is the National Day of Awareness for Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women and Girls — when LaFond was scrolling through a Facebook group called “Social Distance Powwow,” which is in part dedicated to the sharing of Native American culture through art. LaFond decided to paint a portrait of a member of the group whose selfie she saw. “I painted it, shared it with the group and got a lot of reactions, over 2,000 overnight,” LaFond recounted. After the first painting, LaFond decided to do another, which garnered twice as many reactions. Being isolated at home with plenty of canvases and acrylic paints, LaFond decided to keep the portraits going, advertising on the Facebook page that she would paint anyone who has been affected by the epidemic of violence against Indigenous people. “I got 25 [requests] in the first day,” LaFond said. “So at that moment, I went, 'Oh, I guess I should paint all of these, because I don't feel right about picking and choosing.' Because these are people with stories and lives.” Some of the portraits depict victims of violence or family members of victims. LaFond has been winding down the series over the last year and a half, and is in the process of returning the portraits to their subject or subject's family after her current run of shows is done. “If the family wants it, it's theirs, and I'll find a way to get it to them,” LaFond said. “And if they don't, if they're uncomfortable with having it in their home, they can sell it and keep the money or donate the money. It's up to them.” Matthew Barlow, The LAVA Center's humanities coordinator, is responsible for the curation of LaFond's work at the center. Barlow's position, which is funded by Mass Humanities, is coming to a close this summer, making LaFond's exhibit one of Barlow's final projects for the venue. When Barlow first saw LaFond's work, he said, he was overwhelmed. “These portraits kind of blew me away,” Barlow said. “I just felt physically affected.” Barlow's hope is that the exhibit raises awareness of the plight of Native American people. “I've watched people walk in and they can't look away,” Barlow said. “They come timidly, or they march right up, or they carefully go through every story. But people are really noticing it. I've had a lot of conversations with people about it.” For LaFond, the hope is that viewers are “reading [the subject's] story, looking at them as if they're looking at a person, not a painting, because that's the point.” The LAVA Center is open Thursdays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. and 5 to 8 p.m., Fridays from 5 to 8 p.m. and Saturdays from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. More Arts for you 14 Hope St Suite 101 Greenfield, MA 01301 413-772-0261 Circulation Customer Service • 413-774-2741 • circinfo@recorder.com Social Media..."
mov_5494CCBB7BFD89FFE06921EE206EE99A,2025-07-07 16:44:05,en,WEB,"  Amazon Prime Day is back—and it's bigger than ever. For the first time since its inception a decade ago, the members-only Prime event is scheduled to run for four days across 20 countries, instead of the typical two days. The extended Prime Day runs from midnight on July 8 through the 11th, and could generate more than $21 billion in gross merchandise value, growing 60% from last year, estimated Justin Post, an analyst at BofA Securities. “Amazon's 2025 summer Prime Day is poised to be its largest ever, with the potential to deliver record-breaking sales, reinforce its competitive moat, and boost both retail and advertising revenues,” wrote Ivan Feinseth, chief market strategist of Tigress Financial Intelligence. Last year's Prime Day broke records too, Amazon said at the time, notching a new high for both sales and number of items sold. But it isn't just Amazon. Although the e-commerce giant pioneered the midsummer shopping event back in 2015, mid-July sales have become as much of a staple as Black Friday across the sector. This year, Target's Circle Week runs from July 6 through the 12th and Walmart's deals from July 8 through the 13th. The deals will provide a big boost to the digital economy. From July 8 to July 11, U.S. retailers are expected to drive a record $23.8 billion in online spend, up 28.4% year over year, according to estimates from Adobe analytics released Monday. This is equivalent to two Black Fridays, which drove $10.8 billion in online spend in 2024, Adobe said. The firm expects discounts will remain at “historically high levels” across all retailers, ranging from 10% to 24% off an item's listed price. Those discounts should prompt shoppers to buy pricier items that they may have been holding off on until now, Adobe forecasts. Apparel, electronics, televisions, and appliances will see the best deals this week, Adobe projects. Indeed, Amazon already gave shoppers a sneak peek of what they can expect, including up to 50% off on Levi-Strauss apparel and Zappos shoes; up to 40% off on televisions, vacuums, Anker speakers, Samsung Chromebooks and tablets, and premium cosmetics; and up to 30% off on toys, fragrances, and Away suitcases. The company is also introducing “Today's Big Deals,” which are themed daily price drops exclusive to members. The special offers will launch daily at midnight Pacific time and will be available until supplies last, Amazon said. Target and Walmart aren't falling behind. Target is focusing on back-to-school prep, offering Target Circle members 30% off on select apparel, uniforms, backpacks and school supplies, as well as deals on groceries and personal care items. Walmart is also boasting sales on back to school, as well as discounts on electronics, such as knocking off $100 from a Samsung computer monitor. The deals will be available for all Walmart customers, but Walmart+ members get access a day early. And for the first time, Walmart is offering its deals both in stores and online, the company said. Yet even though Amazon's competitors are putting up a good fight, the company will still come out ahead. Prime Day isn't simply a big driver of sales—it also increases Prime membership sign-ups, wrote Brent Thill, an analyst at Jefferies. In 2024, a record-breaking number of customers signed up for Prime in the three weeks leading up to Prime Day, with millions of new members worldwide. The Amazon Prime membership is a major loyalty driver for the retailer, Thill said. A recent Jefferies consumer survey found that 73% of respondents report having a Prime membership—far above 26% for Walmart+ and 22% for Target Circle. Most of those respondents said they intended to keep their memberships, which could present important upside for Amazon, given that research suggests that members of loyalty programs often make more frequent or larger purchases than non-loyalty members. Amazon may also get an extra boost from recently rolled out AI initiatives. This Prime Day, customers can ask Amazon's AI shopping assistant, Rufus, specific questions about timing and tailored deal recommendations; use AI-powered shopping guides to refine searches; and ask Alexa+, Amazon's AI personal assistant, to track prices and notify them when they drop. And that isn't counting any web-traffic benefits Amazon could get from third-party AI chat services and browsers. Adobe expects traffic from generative AI sources to increase by 3,200% year over year across all retailers. Web traffic from AI chatbots is still dwarfed by more traditional search methods, including going to web browsers or through email marketing, Adobe acknowledged, but it's becoming more ingrained in the consumer shopping pattern. In a recent survey of 5,000 U.S. consumers, 55% said they used generative AI for conducting shopping research, 47% said they used it for product recommendations, and 43% said it helped them seek out deals. Historically, Amazon shares have gotten a slight lift following Prime Day, gaining an average of 1.11% the week after the event ends and 3.29% the month after, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The stock could use the boost, no matter how small. Shares are up 1.8% this year as of Thursday's close, underperforming the S&P 500's 6.8% gain and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite's 6.7% increase. Saddle up, deal-hunters—we're in for a long week. Maybe investors should be preparing, too, in case the chance pops up to snap up Amazon stock.

Held under the theme “Summer Pet-tacular,” this year's fair embraced the joy of pet ownership with themed exhibits, entertainment, and educational activities—all while continuing its mission to provide a safe, inclusive, and affordable experience for all San Diegans. “Fair season is the most joyous time of the year — a time when we get to celebrate our community, with our community,” said Carlene Moore, CEO of the 22nd District Agricultural Association, which produces the annual event. “This year, we fostered a remarkable guest experience, tried out new ideas and layouts, and offered top-tier entertainment. The result? Smiling faces, sweet and savory treats, and a festive atmosphere enjoyed by guests of all ages.” Pet-Centered Fun and a New Exhibit The 2025 theme came to life through a 20,000-square-foot exhibit, “Pets Rock: Live on Tour,” presented by Kahoots.

Exclusive research by The Independent reveals Fridays, Sundays and Mondays will be the most crowded days in the terminals. The peak days for the great getaway for all the top UK hubs can be revealed using sources including the airports themselves and flight data supplied exclusively by aviation data analyst Cirium. For the leading Scottish airports, the second week of July will bring the biggest crowds. Several English airports will see a surge in passenger numbers in the final 10 days of July when the schools have broken up. But the quartet of UK airports in the 30-million plus category – , , and – will see their busiest days in the second half of August. Along with peak passenger numbers, runways will be worked hard. At Gatwick, the world's busiest single-runway airport, a plane will land or take off an average of every 95 seconds around the clock on a couple of days in August – with just 65 seconds between departures and arrivals in peak hours. Choosing to fly on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday is likely to lead to a calmer experience. Five of the top airports are busiest on Fridays, and three each are predicted to have their peak days on Sundays and Mondays: Friday: Bristol, , Glasgow, , . Sunday: , Luton, . Monday: Glasgow, Liverpool, Newcastle. The main airports in Northern Ireland and Wales – Belfast International and Cardiff respectively – have already passed their peak days for summer 205. But the Welsh airport will see its busiest day for departures on 28 August, with 2,684 passengers expected to take off. On Monday 1 September, the signal that the country is back to back to work is that London City's busiest day is expected at the start of the ninth month. On that day 89 flights with 9,195 seats will depart from the Docklands airport. Crowd calendar: the peak dates Friday 11 July: Edinburgh Scotland's busiest airport is expected to handle 61,636 passengers, evenly distributed between arrivals and departures. Travellers heading off on holiday will benefit from the airport from the start of this week – raising the limit from 100ml to two litres. Monday 14 July: Glasgow Around 15,000 passengers will depart from the Clydeside airport on a predicted 113 flights to 52 destinations. The most popular international routes from Glasgow are to Dubai, Malaga, Palma, Paris, Tenerife, Faro, Dalaman, Corfu and Toronto. Monday 21 July: Newcastle On Tyneside, the first Monday after the schools break up will be busiest, with 75 departing flights and up to 24,000 passengers flying through Newcastle. Friday 25 July: Birmingham The West Midlands hub is thriving, with 161 flights carrying more than 26,000 people departing on the final Friday of the month. In contrast with the long queues experienced by some passengers in 2024, Birmingham was the first airport this summer to relax security restrictions on liquids. Sunday 27 July: Luton London's fourth-biggest airport (after Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) is expecting to handle more than 31,000 passengers both arriving and departing. The busiest day for departures alone will be the following Friday 1 August, while on the last day of August almost 32,000 passengers are expected to arrive. Peak departures from the busiest airport in the West are on Friday 25/Saturday 26 July. But these two August Fridays will be the busiest days of the summer with around 40,000 people coming and going. Sunday 17 August: Gatwick August is peak month at the Sussex holiday hub. “There are five days over the summer period where we have 900 or more flights, all in August,” a Gatwick spokesperson tells me. The air-traffic controllers will have their work cut out on the first two Sundays, 3 and 10 August, with 904 flights on both days. Peak day for people: Sunday 17 August, with more than 160,000 passing through. Friday 22 August: Manchester Around 115,000 passengers, evenly split between inbound and outbound, are expected to fly out of the nation's third-busiest airport (after Heathrow and Gatwick). The top destinations are mostly Mediterranean sunspots – Palma, Alicante, Antalya and Dalaman – plus Dubai, thanks to the three daily Airbus A380 arrivals and departures on Emirates. Monday 25 August: Liverpool According to Cirium, departing flights and seats will be at a maximum on Monday 28 July, with 66 flights and more than 12,000 seats. But the peak day nominated by Liverpool John Lennon airport is 25 August, the final bank holiday before Christmas. Friday 29 August: Heathrow The UK's busiest airport has declined to specify when it expects the most passengers, but according to Cirium the final Friday in August will see a peak of 685 flights with 151,155 seats. How many of them will be occupied is uncertain. The total of arriving and departing passengers may exceed the all-time peak of 269,000 recorded on 18 August 2024 – which was achieved partly due to travellers attending Taylor Swift's performances at Wembley Stadium.

The peak days for the great getaway for all the top UK hubs can be revealed using sources including the airports themselves and flight data supplied exclusively by aviation data analyst Cirium. For the leading Scottish airports, the second week of July will bring the biggest crowds. Several English airports will see a surge in passenger numbers in the final 10 days of July when the schools have broken up. But the quartet of UK airports in the 30-million plus category – Heathrow, Gatwick, Manchester and Stansted – will see their busiest days in the second half of August. Along with peak passenger numbers, runways will be worked hard. At Gatwick, the world's busiest single-runway airport, a plane will land or take off an average of every 95 seconds around the clock on a couple of days in August – with just 65 seconds between departures and arrivals in peak hours. Choosing to fly on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday is likely to lead to a calmer experience. Five of the top airports are busiest on Fridays, and three each are predicted to have their peak days on Sundays and Mondays: Friday: Bristol, Edinburgh, Glasgow, Heathrow, Manchester. Sunday: Gatwick, Luton, Stansted. Monday: Glasgow, Liverpool, Newcastle. The main airports in Northern Ireland and Wales – Belfast International and Cardiff respectively – have already passed their peak days for summer 205. But the Welsh airport will see its busiest day for departures on 28 August, with 2,684 passengers expected to take off. On Monday 1 September, the signal that the country is back to back to work is that London City's busiest day is expected at the start of the ninth month. On that day 89 flights with 9,195 seats will depart from the Docklands airport. Crowd calendar: the peak dates Friday 11 July: Edinburgh Scotland's busiest airport is expected to handle 61,636 passengers, evenly distributed between arrivals and departures. Travellers heading off on holiday will benefit from the airport easing the “liquids rule” from the start of this week – raising the limit from 100ml to two litres. Monday 14 July: Glasgow Around 15,000 passengers will depart from the Clydeside airport on a predicted 113 flights to 52 destinations. The most popular international routes from Glasgow are to Dubai, Malaga, Palma, Paris, Tenerife, Faro, Dalaman, Corfu and Toronto. Monday 21 July: Newcastle On Tyneside, the first Monday after the schools break up will be busiest, with 75 departing flights and up to 24,000 passengers flying through Newcastle. Friday 25 July: Birmingham The West Midlands hub is thriving, with 161 flights carrying more than 26,000 people departing on the final Friday of the month. In contrast with the long queues experienced by some passengers in 2024, Birmingham was the first airport this summer to relax security restrictions on liquids. Sunday 27 July: Luton London's fourth-biggest airport (after Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted) is expecting to handle more than 31,000 passengers both arriving and departing. The busiest day for departures alone will be the following Friday 1 August, while on the last day of August almost 32,000 passengers are expected to arrive. Fridays 15 and 22 August: Bristol Peak departures from the busiest airport in the West are on Friday 25/Saturday 26 July. But these two August Fridays will be the busiest days of the summer with around 40,000 people coming and going. Sunday 17 August: Gatwick August is peak month at the Sussex holiday hub. “There are five days over the summer period where we have 900 or more flights, all in August,” a Gatwick spokesperson tells me. The air-traffic controllers will have their work cut out on the first two Sundays, 3 and 10 August, with 904 flights on both days. Peak day for people: Sunday 17 August, with more than 160,000 passing through. Friday 22 August: Manchester Around 115,000 passengers, evenly split between inbound and outbound, are expected to fly out of the nation's third-busiest airport (after Heathrow and Gatwick)...."

But at least one company is forecasting that sales for the online sales event will break records as budget-conscious shoppers look for deals. Amazon is holding its annual Prime Day sales from July 8 through July 11 – twice as long as last year's event. The event, open to Prime members, has also offered early-access deals. Still, some Amazon third-party sellers are sitting out this Prime Day, amid pressures from tariffs. A record $23.8 billion in sales is expected to be spent by consumers for Amazon Prime Days, Adobe said in a forecast released on July 7. That's a 28.4% increase year over year and $9.6 billion more than the comparable period last year. Last year, shoppers spent $14.2 billion during the two-day Amazon Prime event, according to Adobe. Adobe said discounts for Prime Days is expected to remain at historically high levels – on par with the major deals that consumers saw last year during the shorter sale. Overall, discounts across U.S. retailers will range from 10% to 24% off list prices with apparel expected to have the biggest deals at 24%, Adobe said. Other categories with major discounts include electronics (22%), televisions (17%), appliances (16%), toys (15%) furniture (14%), computers, (12%) and sporting goods (10%). Consumers are also expected to ""trade up"" to higher-ticket items, driven by strong discounts Adobe said. U.S. shoppers, in two separate surveys ahead of Prime Days, said looming tariffs were playing a role in how they are shopping. In a 2025 summer spending survey of 1,024 U.S. shoppers by Smarty, an online shopping rewards app, shoppers were pretty evenly split in how tariffs were affecting their shopping habits for the Amazon sales. Thirty-two percent of shoppers said they were being more selective about purchases due to budget constraints, while 25% were planning to buy more items to avoid anticipated future price increases. Another 23% said they would focus specifically on categories likely to be affected by tariffs. ""This year's July Prime Day represents a perfect storm of seasonal shopping and economic anxiety,"" Vipin Porwal, founder and CEO at Smarty, said in a press release. ""Consumers are leveraging the discounts not just for immediate needs, but as a hedge against potential future price increases in tariff-affected categories. Prime Day will be an early indicator for consumer savviness in using major sales events as opportunities to make strategic purchases ahead of anticipated price changes."" In another study of 1,000 consumers by Ankeneo, more than half or 57% of those surveyed said tariffs are impacting their Prime Day shopping habits with 25% saying they planned to skip or buy less because of possible price hikes. Four percent of shoppers surveyed said they planned to shop with other retailers, according to the survey by Ankeneo, a software company that works with retailers on its products. Some third-party merchants who previously sold China-made goods during Amazon's July event told Reuters earlier this year that they would be sitting out this year or reducing the amount of discounted merchandise they offer. The pullback, Reuters reported, was a way for sellers to protect profit margins amid the U.S China trade war. In April, Kim Vaccarella, chief executive of China-made tote bag company Bogg Bag, told Reuters that she had decided to skip Prime Day this year. Vaccarella said she wanted to retain some of her unsold U.S. inventory and hoped to sell to retailers and smaller, independent shops, at full price or for smaller discounts. She had also halted production of the bags, which sell for $70 to $200 on Amazon, while she worked to move manufacturing to Cambodia and Vietnam. Smaller third-party Amazon sellers are more impacted by tariff costs than larger retailers, said Katherine Black, a partner at global management consulting firm Kearney where she leads food, drug and mass market retail. ""There have been a number of small suppliers that have said 'Look, I did some forward buys, but I'm holding that inventory to try to sell it close to full price to manage my exposure and I'm not going to participate this year,' "" Black told USA TODAY. When is Amazon Prime Day 2025? Dates, deals and what to know about summer sales event There will still be plenty of deals for shoppers to choose from during Prime Days, Black said. She anticipates potentially seeing what she called big, showcase deals each day from big-named brands. ""Those are techniques we'll see when retailers are trying to drive traffic,"" she said. Lauren Beitelspacher, a professor in the marketing division of Babson College in Wellesley, Massachusetts, whose area of study includes retail thinks the Prime Day event will be successful, especially since consumers are more price-conscious right now with tariffs and there is tariff confusion. ""I think customers are just really looking for a deal wherever they can get one,"" she told USA TODAY. Ten percent tariffs on goods imported to the U.S. began in April, with additional ""reciprocal"" tariffs on imports from more than 70 countries. President Donald Trump later delayed the reciprocal tariffs until July 9. The White House announced on July 7 that the deadline would be extended to August 1.

But these are exactly the creatures that appeared to an unnamed woman recluse living in Winchester, England, over the course of three nights in the summer of 1422. The woman was an anchoress. That means she had chosen - and subsequently vowed - to live in solitary confinement within a small cell attached to a church for the rest of her life.The recluse wrote a vivid account of her vision and sent it to her confessor and a circle of influential churchmen. Her letter, known today as A Revelation of Purgatory , makes her one of the earliest known women writers in the English language. Despite deserving this accolade, the Winchester recluse did not appear alongside her more famous contemporaries or near contemporaries, Julian of Norwich (1342 - after 1416) and Margery Kempe (circa 1373 - after 1438), in the British Library's hugely successful recent exhibition, Medieval Women: In Their Own Words . One likely reason for this is that the manuscript copy of the full account of the vision was not available for display at the time. That situation has now changed. Looking for something good? Cut through the noise with a carefully curated selection of the latest releases, live events and exhibitions, straight to your inbox every fortnight, on Fridays. Sign up here . The British Library has just announced the purchase of five medieval manuscripts from Longleat House in Wiltshire. One of these manuscripts contains the complete surviving version of the recluse's letter, which, although referred to in an incomplete version elsewhere as""a revelation recently shown to a holy woman"", is untitled in this particular manuscript. This may be another reason for this woman's writing having been overlooked until very recently. This exciting purchase will hopefully now give the Winchester recluse and her writing the attention they deserve. Angels feeding souls through a purgatorial furnace in the 15th century manuscript Très Riches Heures du Duc de Berry.Wikimedia CommonsIn her vivid, technicolor visions, the recluse watched a dead friend, a nun named Margaret, ushered to the forefront of purgatory by a cat and dog that she had adored and pampered when she was alive. Transformed into vicious satanic minions, Margaret's former pets joined the many devils responsible for doling out her punishments. They tore endlessly at her flesh and bit and scratched her relentlessly. They did so to remind her that, as a nun, she had broken her vows by keeping them as her companions in her nunnery and by devoting too much love and attention to them. In Margaret's heart, too, a voracious little worm had taken up residence - a so-called""worm of conscience"" - that was intent on consuming her from the inside out as part of her torment. Read more:Cats in the middle ages: what medieval manuscripts teach us about our ancestors' pets So deeply troubling was this vision of her friend's suffering that the Winchester recluse immediately summoned her young maid, and the two women started to pray for the nun's soul. On the very next day the recluse decided there was nothing for it but to document her visions of Margaret's fate. She not only detailed all she had seen, but also stipulated which prayers, and how many, should be said on behalf of poor Margaret to deliver her from her suffering and help her reach the gates of heaven. The recluse's letter is very specific about the date of these visions: they took place on St Lawrence's day, August 10 1322, which fell on a Sunday that year. There was - and still is - a small church dedicated to this saint very close to the cathedral in Winchester (the so-called Mother Church of Winchester). As an anchoress, the author would almost certainly have occupied a cell attached to a church somewhere in Winchester. This would also have allowed her the time and the space for contemplation, study and writing. Read more:Dogs in the middle ages: what medieval writing tells us about our ancestors' pets As has been argued in a recent blog and podcast for the University of Surrey's Mapping Medieval Women Writers project, it is quite possible that the Church of St Lawrence was the location of her cell, where she experienced her visions, and where she wrote down her account of them. This manuscript now permanently joins an unparalleled collection of medieval women's writing in England held in the British Library. It includes not only The Book of Margery Kempe , manuscripts of both the short and long texts of Julian of Norwich's Revelations , but also the Lais and Fables of Marie de France , the Boke of Saints Albans attributed to Juliana Berners, and the letters of the 15th-century Norfolk gentlewoman Margaret Paston and other female family members. As such, the work of this unnamed Winchester anchoress now takes up its rightful place alongside the writing of her hitherto better-known literary sisters. MENAFN08072025000199003603ID1109772755"

mov_1ECE0932E8FF5EB0E1E3087323A18FD3,2025-07-08 14:24:43,en,WEB,"  ( JTA ) — TRONDHEIM, Norway — If ever there was a synagogue that's earned the right to throw itself a birthday shindig, it's this elegant and intriguing house of worship in central Norway only 220 miles south of the Arctic Circle. Over the past century, the Trondheim Synagogue has weathered isolation from the rest of the Jewish world; the Holocaust, which wiped out half its community; challenges related to Shabbat observance because of its far northern latitude, and persistent antisemitism that has only grown worse since the war in Gaza began in 2023. This fall, the synagogue will be observing its 100-year anniversary with a three-day celebration, culminating with an Oct. 26 event which members of Norway's royal family, the country's prime minister, the mayor of Trondheim and other dignitaries are scheduled to attend. “There will be speeches, songs and, of course, we will tell the history of the community,” says John Arne Moen, president of the Trondheim Jewish Community. “We are on the outskirts of the Jewish world, living close to the polar circle. You will probably not find a community like ours any other place in the world.” With a population of about 200,000, Trondheim is Norway's third-largest city, behind Oslo and Bergen. Located on the shores of a fjord that's an inlet in the Norwegian Sea, the city was founded in the year 997 and was Norway's capital during the Viking Age. The city's most famous site is the Nidaros Cathedral, completed in 1300 at the burial place of King Olav II, who is credited with bringing Christianity to Norway. The unlikely story of Jewish life in Trondheim began in the late 19th century, when Jewish immigrants began arriving from Poland and Lithuania, usually because they couldn't afford to go to America. Many worked as traveling merchants. By 1900, there were more than 100 Jews living in Trondheim and the city's first synagogue was established. During the next 20 years, the community grew to more than 300 members, prompting the need for a larger synagogue. In 1923 an old railway station at Arkitekt Christies Gate 1 was purchased with the financial support of approximately 200 Jews from Oslo and converted into a synagogue. It was inaugurated in 1925 and remains — along with the synagogue in Oslo — one of only two synagogues in the country. The building, designed in the Neoclassical style, is fronted by a light-blue façade with arched windows and white molding. Inside, the two-story sanctuary also features a blue motif. Originally, women were seated in the balcony during services. Now, the balcony is no longer used; men and women sit together on the main floor. Germany occupied Norway from 1940 to 1945. The Nazis confiscated the synagogue and used it as a barracks, replacing the Stars of David in the windows with swastikas. It's believed that 165 local Jews — about half of Trondheim's Jewish population at the time — died in the Holocaust, fueled by robust collaboration by local authorities. Most of the victims were deported by train to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, where only a few survived. Early efforts to memorialize the murdered Jews of Trondheim were undertaken by the remnants of the community that survived . But in the mid-1990s, the city embarked on its own memorial enterprise, choosing Cissi Klein — who was 13 when she was seized from her school, deported to Auschwitz and killed upon arrival — to become a symbol of Trondheim's Nazi victims. A statue of Cissi stands in a quiet park a short walk from the Trondheim Synagogue. Built in 1997 as part of the city's millennium commemorations, the memorial is located outside the apartment building where Cissi lived with her parents and brother. A street alongside the park has been named in her honor. Today, Moen estimates there are 200 Jews living in Trondheim; about three-quarters are members of the synagogue. Shabbat services are typically held every other Friday. The chief rabbi of Norway, Michael Melchior, lives in Israel but periodically travels to Oslo and Trondheim to conduct services. ( Melchior's father was the longtime chief rabbi of Denmark .) When Melchior isn't in town, services are usually led by Israeli-born Asher Serussi, a religious leader in the community who has lived in Trondheim for 30 years. Serussi describes the Trondheim Synagogue as “Orthodox but very flexible and modern.” “Most of the people here are not observant Jews,” he said. “Our members are interested in the Jewish culture and traditions. But they don't keep kosher and they don't keep Shabbat. They enjoy very much when we have celebrations for holidays. Then it's a full house here.” For the more religious who follow halacha, or traditional Jewish law, the question about how to handle the starting and ending times of Shabbat has been a topic of debate ever since the congregation was founded in 1905. According to halacha, Shabbat begins a few minutes before sunset and lasts for 25 hours. But Trondheim is located so far north that the amount of daylight can vary between 20 hours in the summer and just four hours in the winter. So what's an Orthodox congregation to do in a country known as “the land of the midnight sun”? Other communities in far northern latitudes handle the issue in a variety of ways . Some set the Shabbat clock based on Jerusalem time, while others divide the day equally into two 12-hour segments. Some start Shabbat at the traditional moment, even if that means lighting candles around midnight. Moen says the congregation developed its own approach in its early years of existence that seemed to be palatable to its members and blessed by most of the Orthodox rabbis who have examined the question. For the Trondheim Synagogue, Shabbat begins at 5:30 p.m. on Fridays and ends at 6:30 p.m. on Saturdays, regardless of the time of year and whether or not there's sunlight or polar darkness. “It's been our rule for 120 years,” says Moen. “We have grown up with it...."

mov_83B03F5FAA813FFED9238143FD72D71C,2025-07-08 16:01:59,en,WEB,"  Going into Amazon's longest Prime Day event yet, Adobe Analytics projects consumers will spend $23.8 billion on ecommerce sites between July 8 and July 11. The longer Prime Day event also comes as U.S. retailers navigate tariffs and could be a strategic play to mitigate their effects. Over the past few years, Amazon's Prime Day event has had reverberations in ecommerce, leading other retailers to hold their own promotional periods to generate sales. In 2024, consumers spent $7 billion online outside Amazon on the second day of the Prime Day event. Meanwhile, Amazon didn't share how much it generated in sales but did say it broke its own record. Adobe said it expects four key trends to define the sales period: Steeper discounts An increase in back-to-school shopping Continued growth in buy now, pay later (BNPL) Increased impact of social media influencers on shopping behaviors “Strong spending during the Prime Day event will be driven by net-new demand, as opposed to higher prices,” Adobe said. “The Adobe Digital Price Index, which tracks online prices across 18 product categories, shows that ecommerce prices have fallen for 33 months — down 2.01% YoY in May 2025. Adobe's numbers are not adjusted for inflation, but if online inflation were factored in, there would be even higher growth in topline consumer spend. Adobe Analytics data is based on more than 1 trillion visits to U.S. retail sites, 100 million SKUs and 18 product categories, according to the company. More than 200 online retailers in the Top 2000 use Adobe Analytics for their web analytics, and more than 100 use it for site design and development. Top 2000 online retailers also use it for content delivery and management, as an ecommerce platform, a marketing platform, for personalization and more. Key trends during Prime Day 2025 After Amazon announced dates for its summer Prime Day event, competitors Walmart and Target did the same, as did other players in the ecommerce space. Adobe expects paid search to “remain the top driver of retail sales” during Amazon's 2025 Prime Day event. It anticipates paid search accounting for about 28% of revenue, which would be up 1% to 3% year over year. It expects BNPL to drive between $1.8 billion and $1.9 billion in overall online spending during Amazon's 2025 Prime Day sales event. That would represent an 8% share, up from 7.6% last year. For affiliates and partners — which include social media influencers — Adobe data indicates their share of revenue will be 19.9% on 16% year-over-year growth. Adobe said its data also shows that “influencers are set to convert shoppers (individuals making a purchase after seeing influencer content) 10 times more than social media overall.” Amazon ranks No. 1 in Digital Commerce 360's Top 2000 Database. The database is how Digital Commerce 360 tracks the largest North American online retailers by their annual ecommerce sales. Walmart ranks No. 2 and Target is No. 3. Amazon is also No. 3 in Digital Commerce 360's Global Online Marketplaces Database. That database ranks the 100 largest global marketplaces by third-party gross merchandise value (GMV). Walmart ranks No. 8 in that database, and Target is No. 64. Amazon is among the “Big Four” Mass Merchants that Digital Commerce 360 covers in depth as part of the State of American Ecommerce Report. Prime Day 2025 sales projection Adobe referred to Amazon's Prime Day event as “Black Friday in the summer.” The $23.8 billion projection that Adobe anticipates Prime Day 2025 to generate in U.S. ecommerce sales would be 28.4% year-over-year growth. It would also be $9.6 billion more than the Amazon Prime Day sales event in 2024. Adobe notes that if its projection is correct, the summer Amazon Prime Day event would generate the equivalent of two 2024 Black Fridays — it drove $10.8 billion in ecommerce sales. And similar to the overall 2024 holiday shopping season, Adobe expects mobile shopping to hit an all-time high, driving 52.5% of U.S. online sales during the event. That would be about $12.5 billion. Overall, Adobe projects U.S. retailers' discounts to be 10% to 24% off listed prices, with the apparel category having the largest deals at 24% (which compares to 20% for the category last year). Other categories Adobe expects to have large discounts include: Electronics at 22% (vs. 23%) Televisions at 17% (vs. 16%) Appliances at 16% (vs. 14%) Toys at 15% (vs. 15%) Furniture at 14% (vs. 16%) Computers at 12% (vs. 11%) Sporting goods at 10% (vs. 11%). Additionally, Adobe expects those discounts to lead consumers to “trade up” to higher-ticket items. It sees the share of the most expensive goods increasing by 18% compared to average year-to-date levels. In the electronics category, that share could rise by 52%, Adobe said...."
mov_3AB4B7F869D336842BDA58FB9AD4AD2C,2025-07-08 16:43:00,en,WEB,"  YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio – Millennial Theatre Company will present “Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat” on July 11-13 and 18-20 at the Youngstown Playhouse. Curtain times are 7:30 p.m. Fridays and Saturday and 2:30 p.m. Sundays. Tickets start at $25 and are available at MillennialTheatre.org and by phone at 330 259 9651. Those who have seen “Joseph” before will find new surprises in this production, according to director Joe Asente. “We knew going into this that Youngstown audiences were very familiar with this show,” he said. “Between the universally beloved Donny Osmond film version and the rich history of this show being produced locally on a Broadway-scale by Easy Street Productions, there was a built-in expectation of what audiences would want to see from this show. We tried very hard to honor and meet those expectations, while also sprinkling in a few of our own new, creative twists throughout.” Asente said he has taken new directions with several of the characters by updating their references. “Dreamcoat” is an ideal choice for a summer musical, he added. “In the summer, we always try to program shows that you can bring your kids and family to, and there are few musicals more family-oriented than 'Joseph,'” Asente said. The cast features Samuel Darrin, Kate DeL, Colleen Chance, Holly Marshall, Terry Shears, Mikaylaa Moore, Ryan Stewart, Jillian Hibbard, Paula Staphenson, Alexander Chapman, Ethan Blevins, Sam Campbell, Rebecca Williams, Liam Burke, Kali Davies-Anderson, Ben Doss, Michelle Jalbert, Amelia Mihalik, Kate Klug, Danny Stephenson, Ashley Tirak, Natalie Horvath, Naomi Horvath, Nora Horvath, Katie Kurdziel, Megan Delaney, Charlotte Anderson, Zoe Bayer, Carlina Carbon, Scarlett Carbon, Annabeth Davidson, Zaina Haidar, Riley Hibbard, Scarlett Hibbard, Sarah Horkey, Spencer Miller, Sawyer Miller, Amaya Slipski, Makenna Slipski and Aleeya Williams. Choreography is by Danielle Mentzer, with musical direction by Megan Miller. One of the most enduring shows of all time, “Dreamcoat” is a reimagining of the Biblical story of Joseph, his father, Jacob, his 11 brothers and the coat of many colors. Told entirely through song with the help of a  narrator, the musical follows the preferred son,  Joseph. After being sold into slavery by his brothers, he ingratiates himself with Egyptian noble Potiphar but ends up in jail after refusing the amorous advances of Potiphar's wife. While imprisoned, Joseph discovers his ability to interpret dreams, and he soon finds himself in front of the mighty Pharaoh. Joseph's solution to Egypt's famine elevates him to Pharaoh's right-hand man and reunites him with his family.

Plus, it's really cute, so I can leave it sitting out on the stove and admire it even when I'm not cooking.” —Erin Johnson, editorial director of content marketing Dyson Airwrap Multi-Styler Nordstrom “The Dyson AirWrap is the Aston Martin of all hair tools, and it certainly has a price to show for it. But since I've been thinking about it for over two years now, it's long out of the 'impulse purchase' category and is something I genuinely think I'd use over and over again, probably every day, even — that's how often I wash my hair!” —Alyssa Grabinski, senior shopping writer Elescat Boho Vintage Sundress, $14 with Prime Amazon “I absolutely roast on the New York subway, so this summer, I'm on the hunt for breezy, lightweight dresses that I can throw on for the office, brunch, and everything in between. I think this simple dress is so cute with over 30 patterns and colors to choose from. Its A-line silhouette looks good on everyone, and the breathable cotton will be ideal as temperatures continue to rise.” —Madison Yauger, shopping editor Camkory Digital Camera, $40 with Prime Amazon “I bought this digital camera during Black Friday, as I wanted to try one out that was similar to the cameras I had when I was a teenager. It's been a fun little addition to my camera collection, especially when traveling and at parties and weddings I've brought it to. My 10-year-old nephew has become a fan of it, and it's super easy to use. Now he'll have his own camera to practice taking photos with instead of asking to use mine!” —Jennifer Maldonado, associate editorial director Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray, $20 with Prime Amazon “This frizz-fighting blow dry spray is an essential part of my summer haircare lineup, so I'm stocking up while it's on sale to keep my hair looking sleek and shiny all season long — even in the worst humidity.” —Maggie Horton, shopping writer Summer Fridays Tinted Lip Butter Balm People..."
1lv9z4v,2025-07-09 04:42:48,en,REDDIT,"  I'm currently on intermittent FMLA and New York State Paid Family Leave (PFL) to care for a newborn. My typical work schedule was Monday through Friday, 8 AM to 4 PM, but I'm now working Thursdays and Fridays while using leave for the rest of the week. My partner is doing the reverse, allowing us to maintain full-time childcare coverage. I'm considering resigning from my position after the FMLA/PFL period ends in the summer to take on full-time caregiving. I know that, under federal FMLA guidelines, if I don't return to work for at least 30 days after my leave ends, my employer can potentially recover the employer-paid portion of health insurance premiums. However, it's unclear whether this repayment obligation also applies in cases of *intermittent* FMLA/PFL. My company's benefits are administered through TriNet. Neither the internal company handbook nor TriNet's Employee Handbook seems to address this specific scenario. Since I'm not ready to inform HR about my resignation, I'm hesitant to raise the question directly with HR or TriNet and risk having the inquiry relayed back. Any guidance or experience with similar situations would be greatly appreciated."
mov_BFB776E9F5CA993808522FDCCB65C6E6,2025-07-09 07:33:31,en,WEB,"  Greta Thunberg's little-known sister has spoken out about her relationship with the climate activist in rare comments after footage of her singing went viral. Bea Ernman, 19, told Swedish outlet Hänt that she was finding her time in the limelight 'fun' after MailOnline revealed how she had changed her name and was pursuing a career as a performer. She acknowledged she is often mentioned in the same breath as her famous older sister, 22, who made international headlines last month as she tried to sail to Gaza to deliver humanitarian aid in an audacious awareness campaign. Asked how she feels about the comparisons, she reflected: 'I think it happens to all people who are in the spotlight. 'But there you have such different things you do and you have completely different careers, so in the end it will be very different.' The young singer was pithy in her assessment of how they were as people: 'Very different.' Ernman came out of the shadows earlier this summer when she shared clips of herself singing in Stockholm. She said she has been performing since childhood and at the age of just 19-years-old is now putting the final touches on her first album. 'It's very cocky,' she told Hänt. ' I want people to feel uplifted when they listen to it.' The album is expected to be released later this year. Previously known as Beata Thunberg, the performer has started using her mother's maiden name, perhaps in an effort to put some distance between herself and her controversial older sibling, or echo the artistic flair running through the family. Bea's mother is Malena Ernman, a former Eurovision contestant and mezzo-soprano opera singer. Her father is Swedish film producer and screenwriter, Svante Thunberg. Bea is following in the footsteps of her successful parents - and sister - while insisting she wants to carve her own path. She acknowledged the attention can be overwhelming, but said that being an artist is 'about being seen, being on stage and getting attention'. While the Thunberg sisters have not shied away from building public profiles, Greta has in the past recognised the strain it can take. In 2019, she acknowledged the toll her work took on her sister when she admitted, 'the one who suffers is my sister'. 'The people who write threats and hate to me do it to the whole family, even to her. 'The difference between me and the people who are left at home is that I am always travelling, inaccessible. People don't know where I am staying, where I sleep at night, where I am. I have no daily life. 'But for my sister at home, who tries to have a daily life … she is much more reachable.' Bea, now old enough to embark on her own journey, judged that her 'voice was built from pain' as she reflected on a recent performance at Stockholm's Musikaliska - the same concert hall where Albert Einstein received his Nobel Prize over a century ago. She revealed on Instagram that the path to becoming a star has not been easy. Some in the audience 'looked scared' while others 'covered their ears', she said. Still a teenager, she has already built up enough resilience to take it on the chin. 'I don't care if people love my artistry or hate it, as long as I make them feel something,' she wrote. ' Not pity. Love or hate. That's the point of being an artist.' Greta has been supportive and protective of her little sister in the few comments made publicly. After Bea performed a rendition of her single Bara Du Vill (a Swedish phrase that translates to 'Only if you want') on Swedish TV in 2019, Greta plugged the song on her own Instagram and expressed admiration for 'my super talented sister' on Facebook. She reiterated her stance months later, while calling for kindness towards Beata. After her famous speech at the United Nations climate summit made her a household name, Greta - then 16 - told Swedish news outlet Dagens Nyheter how her 'wonderful and strong' sister had to bear the brunt of her activism work. Despite the hateful messages that were directed at Beata, she continued supporting Greta by showing up for the older Thunberg's Fridays for Future - or School Strike for Climate - action that turned the spotlight on the Swedish activist in 2018. In 2020, Beata was cast opposite her mother when she was chosen to play a young Edith Piaf in a musical, Malena depicting the French singer in her later years. 'I have been dancing and singing for as long as I can remember,' Beata reacted to the casting announcement, according to news agency DPA. 'To be able to perform her immortal music is a dream come true,' she said, referring to the iconic songstress Piaf. Greta has taken a vastly different path, becoming a recognisable face at the front of a number of activist campaigns. Thunberg shot to fame aged 15, in 2018, when she started skipping school in protest of Sweden's climate policies. Her School Strike for Climate garnered international attention, building a platform for the teenager to go on pressuring world leaders to do more to mitigate the impacts of climate change. More recently, Greta has piled criticism on Israel for its conduct in the war with Hamas in Gaza, and in June sailed from Sicily towards the beleaguered Palestinian enclave in an effort to raise awareness and deliver a symbolic amount of aid to the civilian population. Greta, and the 11 crew on board the Madleen, were apprehended by the IDF and detained before being deported."
mov_74CB11B582C44552A319310E94EB6E8F,2025-07-09 09:32:40,en,WEB,"  The Chi season 7 premiered on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME on May 16, 2025. It promises a dozen new episodes, with one episode to be released every week on Fridays. While the show has explored various storylines over the years, its story remains focused on the complexities of the Black community in the South Side of Chicago. Showtime's hit series The Chi season 7 was filmed and produced entirely in the city of Chicago. In that sense. It gives an authentic look and feel of the city and its culture that is the very essence of the story told by the show, because the series is set in Chicago. Lena Waithe's The Chi is all about the lives of the residents of the Chi neighborhood and the complexity in the Black community. Find out more about the show below, including where it was filmed. The city of Chicago has been the center of The Chi's filming and production since it debuted on SHOWTIME in January 2018, and its namesake city remains the primary backdrop for the new season. The filming for The Chi season 7 reportedly kicked off in May 2014 and went on until October of that same year. From the show's IMDb page, there were no specific areas where the series was filmed in the city. However, it also listed the Cinespace Chicago Film Studios as one of its shooting locations, which was most likely utilized for filming various indoor and outdoor scenes for the series. Cinespace has filming studios in various locations, including Chicago, Atlanta, Toronto, and Wilmington. It has been the shooting location of choice for many TV shows, like The Summer I Turned Pretty, Hulu's The Handmaid's Tale, and Stranger Things, to name a few. The Chicago studio, where The Chi season 7 was filmed, boasts a 1.6 million square-foot area with 36 active stages and two campuses. All of these are conveniently located 15 minutes from downtown, per their website. In The Chi season 7, there will be plenty of power struggles and a quest for revenge. Some of the deaths at the tail end of the last season will fuel some of the storylines in season 7, including Alicia trying to find justice for her son Rob's murder. Here's what the new season will be about, per the synopsis: Here are the main cast and characters returning for the seventh season of the series: After his character died in The Chi season 6, Curtiss Cook will not be returning as Douda in season 7. Other former cast members like Alex R. Hibbert, Tyla Abercrumbie, and Miriam A. Hyman won't be returning as well. Catch new episodes of The Chi season 7 streaming on Paramount+ with SHOWTIME every Friday and on TV on SHOWTIME every Sunday."

The stepdaughter of Travis Barker dropped an eye-popping snapshot on her Stories that has caught the attention of her social media fans. Atiana flaunted her killer physique in a tiny two-piece that bared her enviable curves. Atiana De La Hoya Takes A Dip In The Pool View this post on Instagram A post shared by Atiana De La Hoya (@atianadelahoya) The photo showed the 26-year-old lounging on a rectangular pool floatie featuring stripes and a checkered print in yellow, white, and green. She lay on her back along the edge of the inflatable but kept her upper body up using both arms. The socialite stretched her right leg and planted her left foot on the ledge. As if her scanty two-piece wasn't enough to tantalize her online audience, Atiana amped up the ante by tugging on her bikini bottoms. She also raised her chin to the sky while enjoying the sunshine, which cast a beautiful glow on her flawlessly tanned complexion. Bikini Body On Display  Instagram Stories | Atiana De La Hoya Atiana wore an olive green number that popped against her sun-kissed body. The top's triangle cups were so tiny that she spilled out from the sides -- exposing a hint of sideboob. Its low-cut neckline also displayed an ample amount of her cleavage, which was enhanced by the tight fit of the garment. The thin white straps were secured over her neck while the lower strings wrapped around her midriff. The model sported matching bottoms that were even more risqué than the top half of her look. Her scanty swimwear had high-leg cuts that helped accentuate her hips and hourglass silhouette. The front side dipped several inches below her navel, highlighting Atiana's taut tummy. Letting It All Hang View this post on Instagram A post shared by Atiana De La Hoya (@atianadelahoya) For the pool session, Atiana ditched the accessories to let her bikini body do all the talking. Despite posting the pic on a Monday, Atiana wrote, ""SUMMMERRR Fridays."" Some fans took the opportunity to shower the socialite with praise. ""Heating up summer I see,"" wrote one admirer, while another fan, who may have mentioned Atiana's half sister on her mother's side, remarked, ""Hotter than Alabama."" Atiana De La Hoya's Relationship With Stepdad Travis Barker View this post on Instagram A post shared by travisbarker (@travisbarker) Atiana is the daughter of Travis' ex-wife, Shanna Moakler, and the famous boxer, Oscar De La Hoya. The former exes' other children include Landon, 21, and Alabama, 22. Despite not being a biological child of Travis, he treats her like one of his own. Through the years, Atiana maintains a close relationship with her stepdad and her siblings, even when Travis and Shanna have broken up. Oscar De La Hoya Praises Travis Barker MEGA In July 2023, the legendary boxer opened up on why he let Shanna and Travis raise his daughter, Atiana. ""I basically ran away,"" De La Hoya admitted on the Allison Interviews podcast on July 20. ""I was scared. I was fearful. I did try to be a father full-time for a few years, and it was beautiful. It was amazing to raise a little girl but there came a point where you say to yourself, 'Wait a minute. You're not worthy of this.'"" De La Hoya also expressed his gratitude to the Blink-182 drummer for being a ""father figure"" to Atiana. ""I have to give credit where credit is due, and I'm grateful that Barker was there, you know, as a father figure to my daughter,"" he said. ""I have to be thankful that Shanna was a mother to Atiana, and I know my place, basically. My place, I obviously am a father, and I'm proud of that,"" De La Hoya continued. ""But, again, I'm grateful for what they've done. Especially what Barker did. He's obviously stepped up."""

Lennon landed a spot among eight contestants in the show's fourth season, scheduled locally at 6 p.m. Friday. Other weekly segments run Fridays through Aug. 15. Raised until age 13 in a leprosy village in Surin - a northeastern province of Thailand - Lennon loves the bold Isaan cuisine she now embraces for creating recipes. Her blog, Simply Suwanee, offers tips to home cooks to ease into Thai cooking. The show's team reached out to her. ""I didn't expect this; it just came out of nowhere,"" said Lennon, 47. Before her Nashville trip in fall 2024 for filming, Lennon said, she realized that the show offered a larger stage to share about her Thailand village and its residents. ""After some talking and thinking, I just knew this was bigger than me,"" she said. ""It was about me telling my story and the story of the people I grew up with. ""I wanted to go on the show for them and to showcase my culture, Thai food and the country I grew up in."" The PBS competition highlights a variety of tastes and traditions from around the U.S., while delving into the personal stories behind the home cooks' signature dishes. This season brings influences from Bangladeshi to Belizean, Puerto Rican to Southern flavor, Cajun to Afghan, and Filipino to Lennon's Thai dishes. Host Alejandra Ramos is joined by chefs and restaurateurs Tiffany Derry and Timothy Hollingsworth, along with ""Splendid Table"" host Francis Lam, as judges who guide the contestants. The opening episode includes guest judge Al Roker, TV weatherman, cookbook author and creator of an upcoming PBS KIDS series ""Weather Hunters."" Lennon, a photographer, sent in Thailand pictures to air on the show along with the stories she tells about her village. She first heard from ""The Great American Recipe"" staff via social media and email, initially mistaking it for spam. After a second email, she researched names and realized they were legitimate. Her follow-up call led to phone interviews, and Lennon said she felt comfortable from the start. She likes the show's storytelling and heritage. ""Eight of us were selected from around the country,"" Lennon said. ""We all competed against each other in the cuisine of our background, and with that, also the stories. ""I think that's the heart and soul of 'The Great America Recipe,' to share recipes we make in America, but they have a lot of heritage included with memories and families."" Each week, after two challenges, the judges determine who has the winning dish. For the finale, the top three cooks compete to win the national search for ""The Great American Recipe."" Lennon features signature dishes such as Khanom Jeen Nam Ya - also called Thai Fish Curry - and a spicy, herb-packed laab salad. ""Fish curry was a dish that I grew up with in Thailand, and the one I used when going back to feed the village,"" Lennon added. ""It's one of my favorite dishes of all time, the Khanom Jeen Nam Ya."" Lennon raises money for a campaign she began two years ago, Feed the Village Project, to give back to her hometown's elderly leprosy patients. Lennon has since made two trips to Thailand to help her community. She went alone in April 2023, when she and 15 women cooked enough food to feed the village for two days. In 2024, her children raised money with a Thai tea stand and art projects to benefit children in the village. They joined their mom on a return trip a year ago, in summer 2024. Lennon was born in Bangkok to a young, unwed mother, who didn't tell her American soldier boyfriend about the pregnancy. Unable to care for a baby, her mom took Lennon to a sister. Lennon was raised by that aunt and uncle, both who had leprosy. The Thailand government about 70 years ago built 14 leprosy villages, each gated and isolated, she said. Younger generations, including Lennon, don't have the disease but they saw the stigma faced by older residents. That's true even now, said Lennon, who went to school outside of the village. An American woman, who visited her village with a Thai doctor, later sponsored her journey to the U.S. at age 13. Before Lennon left her village, many of the residents gave her gifts and small bills, although they were poor. Lennon, who first lived in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, eventually married an Air Force pilot. Now a cargo airline pilot, he retired from the military in 2022. At home in Spokane, they have a son, 12, and daughter, 10. Every four to six weeks, Lennon is a chef for a day to cook at Spokane's Feast World Kitchen, a nonprofit restaurant. That work has helped her boost her fundraising. ""When my husband retired from the Air Force, I decided I'm going to pursue this dream of feeding the village, of feeding the people who have given me so much, with the little they have,"" she said. ""Last year was bigger than expected because I was able to raise a lot more money. ""I was able to raise money to support my project and not just feed more people, but we also incorporated my kids in where we raised money for (village) school supplies and uniforms. We also built a house for a family of five and helped with different things in the village, like the solar lights that were broken for years.""..."

Froedtert South Hospital in Pleasant Prairie is planning to add a 50,000 square foot, four story addition to its current site. Plans for the expansion were approved by the Pleasant Prairie Plan Commission during a meeting Monday A major expansion including an emergency medical services training facility is coming to Froedtert South Hospital in Pleasant Prairie. The hospital plans to add a 50,000 square-foot, four-story addition to the current hospital at 9555 76th St., which will include a dedicated EMS training facility on the first floor and space for future clinical expansion on the upper levels. Preliminary site and operational plans were approved during a Pleasant Prairie Plan Commission meeting Monday. It is tentatively schedule for start of construction by late summer, taking about 14 months to complete. The addition will take the space currently used for parking between the existing Emergency Department and Cancer Center, both of which will not be moved. The EMS training facility will provide hands-on education and simulation-based training for first responders and clinical personnel. People are also reading… ""The EMS Building is being built for all of the rescue squad members at all of our fire stations in Kenosha County as well as northern Illinois,"" said Froedteert South Hospital System President and CEO Ric Schmidt. ""The goal is for the EMS providers, predominantly paramedics and EMTs, to simulate real life experiences in a lab on simulation manikins that feel and respond virtually like human beings. ""The planning for the EMS Building is being steered by all of the chiefs and training chiefs in our service area so as to build a training center that we hope exactly meets their needs,"" Schmidt said. ""The labs can simulate being on the side of a busy highwa,y or in a bar or at an accident scene with all the visuals and sounds that one would experience if they were actually there."" He explained Froedtert South representatives have been meeting since 2024 with Kenosha County fire chiefs and fire training chiefs to get their input on the design, layout and equipment for the training facility. ""We are building this training facility specifically to meet their needs,"" Schmidt said. The facility is being designed to offer a comprehensive range of training opportunities, including basic life support certification, advanced cardiac life support certification, trauma life support certification, trauma response training and realistic simulation exercises. An accompanying training program is being developed to improve the skills and preparedness of EMS professionals and hospital staff through interaction with board-certified specialists and ongoing educational sessions. ""The lab will have extensive cameras and recording instruments which will permit a retrospective evaluation as to how the training exercise went,"" Schmidt said. Once constructed, the EMS training facility is projected to operate Mondays through Fridays from 6 a.m. to 6 p.m., with potential weekend hours based on demand. When fully operational, the new facility is expected to add three to five new full-time and part-time positions. The upper three floors will be built but not initially outfitted. The space is meant for future clinical use, tailored to meet the needs of the community and the hospital, officials said. The expansion will include an additional entrance and connection to the main hospital on the first floor. Exterior building materials will be selected to match the existing building design to maintain a consistent architectural look throughout the entire facility. Hospital operations will continue uninterrupted throughout the construction period.

His show is titled Light Gathers at the Edge. Putt says of his work: “Like the maquettes of invented machines by Leonardo DaVinci or Vladimir Tatlin's revolutionary tower, I endeavor to give form to utopian aspirations and create alternative structures of perception and experience.” The second exhibition is Wild Growth, South Side by Ruby Chavez. She is a local multidisciplinary artist, creative director, and producer who says her art is “not just about what we see — it's about what we carry. It's about honoring the ground we stand on, the people we come from, and the colors that shaped us long before we knew their names.” Also at Echo this month is the Summer Ceramic Show, featuring 21 local artists “who create functional and sculptural work.” They were chosen for the event out of more than 50 applications - Kevin C. Madigan From the venue: “Light Gathers at the Edge” - Aaron Kagan Putt - Solo Exhibition Aaron Kagan Putt's work seeks to embody alternative possibilities through abstract forms that merge architectural structure with speculative visions. Drawing from sacred and utopian architecture, science fiction, and the natural world, Putt creates works that operate at the intersection of the tangible and the ineffable, offering a fantastical interpretation of the future through process-driven experimentation and material discovery. Aaron Kagan Putt (born in Tucson, AZ) is an artist and educator based in Atlanta, GA, whose multidisciplinary practice encompasses sculpture, painting, drawing, and photographic processes.

Coronation Street has finally resolved the mystery of what happened to Gary Windass. The truth is revealed in Thursday's episode, which is streaming early on ITVX and YouTube this morning ahead of the ITV1 airing at 9pm tonight. So only read on if you really want to know... What to Read Next Corrie's latest episode – – features which explain how Gary came to be . The first clue to the guilty party emerges when a guilty-looking Lou Michaelis is seen keeping watch at Gary's hospital bedside. Scheming Lou is posing as Gary's wife, disguising their identities by claiming that she is 'Gemma' and he is 'Chesney'. Flashbacks then show that Lou ruthlessly threatened Gary a few weeks ago, in a desperate bid for a cash payout. Lou warned Gary that she'd destroy his marriage to Maria Connor with false allegations that they were having an affair, unless he secured her silence by paying her off. Gary refused to be bullied and threatened to report Lou to the police for blackmail. When he then issued some home truths over Lou and her chaotic family, it was the final straw as she hit him over the head with an iron bar. This shocking turn of events took place on the night of , when some of the Street's younger crowd got high on LSD. While under the influence of the drug, Nina Lucas and Summer Spellman approached Gary after spotting him in a bad way on the ground. Gary reached out for help but Nina panicked and pushed him away, before the two friends rushed off in terror. Afterwards, they were confused about what they'd seen amid their hallucinations and had no idea that it was Gary. Another recent mystery finally solved. Lou covered her tracks by overseeing Gary's admission to hospital and posing as his wife. But the stage now looks set for , as Thursday's episode ends with Gary waking from his coma. Will Gary be able to identify Lou as his attacker? And will she manage to get away from Weatherfield before she's brought to justice?

mov_15B013CCDBFC7A208440BF9A3A685CD4,2025-07-10 11:30:00,en,WEB,"  Michelin-recognized and hailed by the LA Times and New York Times, Filipino restaurant Spoon & Pork now finds itself in a battle just to keep the lights on. And they're not alone, according to a new report from NBC 4 News. Don't miss When Jay Tugas and Raymond Yaptinchay launched Spoon & Pork out of a food truck in 2017, they weren't just serving modern Filipino fare, they were introducing a culture. “When people enjoy the food, it touches our heart,” Tugas told the news station. “Because that's what we wanted to do, we wanted to introduce our dishes, our culture, to everyone.” By 2020, they had grown to two brick-and-mortar restaurants, one in Silver Lake, the other in Sawtelle Japantown. The rave reviews were rolling in. But now? “It's really tough, it's really hard,” Tugas said. “I had to let go of all my servers, and my kitchen staff. So now it's just me and my business partner Raymond.” 'What is going on?' Despite glowing 4-star reviews on Yelp and Google, Spoon & Pork is struggling to keep the lights on. In a social media clip, Tugas showed an empty dining room. “Sometimes it's just like, you know, it leaves my brain blank,” Tugas said. “Like what is going on?” More in Lifestyle “At the end of the day, it's more important for me to have people coming in than having the reviews,” he added. According to the report, Spoon & Pork's story echoes what many LA restaurant owners are experiencing. Recent closures are affecting everyone from buzzy newcomers to established favorites. “Everything's expensive, number one,” Tugas explains, “I think the taxes here are atrocious, we pay almost 30% after every sale. It's just crazy. Labor's very expensive.” Even for a Michelin-recognized kitchen, the math no longer adds up. Tugas believes the restaurant industry never truly recovered from COVID's economic wreckage. “We were like, 2020 is going to be awesome,” he recalls with tears in his eyes, “And then, come March, everything shuts down. So we've been really battling from that time, from the day we opened until now. It was a constant battle.” With government relief gone, prices rising, and consumer spending shrinking, many restaurants are hanging by a thread. “This one is not going to last,” Tugas says, “And I'm working hard for the other one to stay open as well.” Dining scene in trouble America's once-booming dining scene appears to be in trouble. Restaurants may be facing their worst financial squeeze since the pandemic with skyrocketing food and labor costs and a sharp decline in consumer spending. According to a KPMG survey, Americans plan to spend 7% less per month at restaurants this summer compared to fall 2024. “Nearly 70% say they're eating at home more often than last year, and 85% cite budget constraints as the top reason,” says the report. Fast food visits are up, while casual dining is down. Many chain restaurants are closing down locations. For example, TGI Fridays filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy, reducing its U.S. locations to 85. Red Lobster, Hooters, Subway, Applebee's, Mod Pizza, and Buffalo Wild Wings have also scaled back significantly, closing dozens, sometimes hundreds, of units. Something contributing to the trouble may be the shift from in-person dining to delivery. An aftereffect of the pandemic is that consumers are more comfortable with getting takeout or delivery. Michael Kaufman from Harvard Business School told The Guardian that three-quarters of the restaurant traffic across the country is off-premises. “The majority of restaurant operators across all segments — including 90% of fine dining operators and 87% of casual dining operators — say building on-premises business is more important for their success than greater off-premises business,” says the National Restaurant Association. A Bank of America 2025 forecast says digital proficiency will continue to be a key differentiator. It says, “While not yet common, automation and robotics are set to play a more significant role in the industry.” What to read next Money doesn't have to be complicated — sign up for the free Moneywise newsletter for actionable finance tips and news you can use.

The Catholic Charities St. Lucy Food Project gathers food year-round from many of the diocesan schools in the area. On Thursday (July 10), kids participating in summer camp at Bishop Ireton High School filled a box truck with canned fruit, vegetables, rice, and more. More than 1,200 pounds of food were collected at Bishop Ireton. “We're serving 24% more clients than last year,” James McCaskey, an outreach specialist from Catholic Charities St Lucy Food Project, told ALXnow. “It increased from 2022, which was just under 300,000 total food insecure individuals… and now we're at like 323,000 people.” The drive is part of the year-round organization's “Summer for Hungry Children” campaign. This fall, the St. Lucy Food Project will conduct its Fall Harvest drive, aiming to collect up to 60,000 pounds of food. More collections are scheduled for the coming days, and donations can also be made through the St. Lucy Food Project's Amazon wishlist. “It makes it a lot easier for people to donate remotely,” McCaskey said. “In the past month, we've received over 4,000 pounds just from Amazon wishlist donations.” Donations can also be dropped off at the Catholic Charities Alexandria food pantry at 4527A Eisenhower Avenue. Non-expired and unopened food donations are accepted on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Fridays from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. The nonprofit needs the following: Breakfast cereals (in box) and instant or old-fashioned oatmeal (18 oz. or 42 oz.)

The Broadway musical is based on Disney's 1992 film of the same name, which starred young actors Christian Bale and Christian Slater as the newsboys opposite Ann-Margaret as a nightclub singer, Bill Pullman as a determined newspaper reporter and Robert Duvall as Pulitzer. The stage version added seven new songs by the original team of Alan Menken and Jack Feldman while keeping many of the beloved songs from the film, including “Carrying the Banner,” “Seize the Day,” “King of New York” and “Santa Fe” during the two-and-a-half-hour tale of triumph. Performances are 7 p.m. Friday and Saturday, July 18, 19, 25 and 26, and 2 p.m. Sundays July 20 and 27, at Holdcraft Performing Arts Center, 1200 Spring St. in Michigan City.

Despite spreading wildfires, escalating anti-tourist sentiment, and the cost-of-living crisis still hitting cash-strapped Brits - many of us refuse to part with our beloved summer holiday. Whether you're heading for a booze-fuelled week in Benidorm, or plan on eating your body weight in feta cheese while exploring the picturesque Greek islands - surveys have found that around 55 per cent of Brits have or intend to book an overseas holiday this year. For those restricted to school term time, travelling in the peak summer months is their only option - despite spiralling costs and intense temperatures. In the past, this has resulted in huge traffic jams, long queues in security, and jam-packed airports. According to aviation data from Cirium shared with The Independent, flying on a Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday or Saturday could be your best bet - as these days tend to be much quieter than Fridays, Sundays, and Mondays. This particularly applies to London Heathrow Airport - the UK's biggest aviation hub - which is slated to handle a whopping 685 flights on the last Friday of August. Heathrow has not confirmed how many passengers will be flying through the airport on this particular day, but Cirium states it could be as high as 151,155. It's a similar story for London Gatwick, which is slated for a five-day rush in August where there will be more than 900 flights. ""The air-traffic controllers will have their work cut out on the first two Sundays, 3 and 10 August, with 904 flights on both days,"" The Independent states. ""The peak day for people [is] Sunday 17 August, with more than 160,000 passing through."" Up in the north, and things aren't much calmer. Manchester, the UK's third busiest airport following Heathrow and Gatwick, is bracing to handle a staggering 115,000 outbound and inbound passengers on Friday, August 22. The airport is highly popular amongst Brits wanting cheap flights to European hotspots such as Spain and Turkey. Edinburgh has already witnessed its 'busiest day' which is likely due to differences in when schools break up for the summer holidays in Scotland. On Friday, July 11, the airport was thought to have handled around 61,636 passengers. UK Airport's busiest day - full list Edinburgh - Friday, July 11 Glasgow - Monday, July 14 Newcastle - Monday, July 21 Birmingham - Friday, July 25 London Luton - Sunday, July 27 Bristol - Friday, July 15 and Friday, August 22 London Gatwick - Sunday, August 17 Manchester - Friday, August 22 Liverpool - Monday, August 25 London Heathrow - Friday, August 29 Stansted - Sunday, August 31"

Co-anchorJonathan Lemire framed the segment around fear of 'high profile clashes' in 'Democratic controlled cities' in thecountry, whereICE was focusing their efforts. It'sworth noting that citieslike Los Angeles,with Democratleadership,wereplaces that supported illegal immigration via their so-called sanctuary city polices. It's no wonder why ICE was in those places. As theformerSenior Advisor and Chief Spokesperson for Vice President Kamala Harris,Sander-Townsendmade statementsregardingICE's motivation for the arreststhat boiled down them just being racist: Yeah, this is about to bevery clear.It'sabout race.It'snot necessarily about risk because we have seen ICE go into disproportionately communities of color, disproportionately Latino and Hispanic. And I would also argue I would also note black and brown, black communities and go to courthouses...This is about, at this point, meeting a particular arbitrary quota, frankly, that the White House care of Stephen Miller has set forward. And we are going to continue as we get closer anddeeper and deeperinto the summer, as we go into the fall to see racial profiling. The factswerethatit's easierfor people who livedin LatinAmericaandSouth America to travel north, whichwaswhy Latinos andHispanics contribute to a major population of illegal immigrants.That fact wascompletely taken out of context forthe purpose ofwhat ICEwasfor.ICEwasnot arresting people based on their race, butratheriftheywere in the country illegally. The liberal mediahaveshown supportand sympathy towards illegal immigrants receiving thesame privilegesasAmerican citizens,andthey have forgotten that ICE wasestablishedtouphold the law andprotect thecountry. Former White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki contributed to theconversation by suggesting that ICE was 'kidnapping' people. She also whined about them arresting people who lost the cases in immigration court: They are going into communities where peopledon'thave criminal records or people arelaw-abiding, even people who are going to their court hearingsandthey'retargeting people...So when they say they're going after the worst of the worst and the hardest of the hardest, what they'reactuallydoingto meet that, try to meet that 3000 number thatStephen Miller and others have set is they're going after what they consider low hanging fruit. People who arelaw-abiding, some who pay taxes, who are going to courtrooms to meet that number, andthey'regoing into citieslike L.A. to create a visionof chaosasif they are there to calm things, whenreallythey are the ones who are creating the chaos.Sothis is quite performative. Jen, theybrokethelaw ifthey were here illegally.Defending illegal immigrants as 'law-abiding' is hypocritical. Between 'racial profiling,''kidnapping,'and not getting the concept of the word illegal, the liberal mediapushedthe agenda that ICEwasthevillainfor keeping America safe and upholding thelaw. Meanwhile,they promotedthosewhowere hereillegally. Click here for the transcript. MSNBC's Morning Joe 7/10/25 9:24 a.m. Eastern JONATHAN LEMIRE: And Jen Psaki, a Trump official yesterday telling me that because the border is basically been closed, you know, that the heat, this this official suggests they're victim of their own success. Therefore it's not easy to find these deportations. You know, that's because they have to therefore go into the cities to make their numbers. And that's what I think is being telegraphed here is those, as Julia mentioned, those high profile clashes in Los Angeles, those ICE agents there leading to protests. President Trump has all but telegraphed that this summer we should expect a lot more of that in cities, particularly Democratic controlled cities across the country. JEN PSAKI: Well, I also think it's quite performative, Jonathan. I mean, they are - they have National Guard troops they shouldn't be using in this way. They are going into communities where people don't have criminal records or people are law abiding, even people who are going to their court hearings and they're targeting people. A lot of the reporting I've seen lately has been about 50 percent. I don't know what the exact latest numbers, but about 50 percent of the people who they are arresting, some of them kidnaping, some of them deporting are not, don't have any record at all. So when they say they're going after the worst of the worst and the hardest of the hardest, what they're actually doing to meet that - try to meet that 3,000 number that Stephen Miller and others have set, is they're going after what they consider low hanging fruit. People who are law abiding, some who pay taxes, who are going to courtrooms to meet that number. And they're going into cities like L.A. to create a vision of chaos as if they are there to calm things, when really they are the ones who are creating the chaos. So this is quite performative. It's also about trying to hit these numbers and not going after people who are doing anything in society aside from being law abiding. SYMONE SANDERS-TOWNSEND: Yeah, this is about - to be very clear. It's about race. It's not necessarily about risk because we have seen ICE go into disproportionately communities of color, disproportionately Latino and Hispanic. And I would also argue - I would also note black and brown -black communities and go to courthouses. We've seen them target traffic stops. We have seen viral videos of ICE approaching people in their yards. This is about, at this point, meeting a particular arbitrary quota, frankly, that the White House care of Stephen Miller has set forward. And we are going to continue as we get closer and deeper and deeper into the summer, as we go into the fall to see racial profiling. And we're going to see these stories come out more and more. And I have to wonder what local municipalities, but also Congress and just law abiding citizens think about this? Are we a country where we are comfortable, where we are going to racially profile people who are here based on the color of their skin, because Stephen Miller and the President wanted me to quota? That's the question we have to ask ourselves. MIKA BRZEZINSKI: Symone Sanders-Townsend, thank you...."

After offering countless hits such as Water, Push 2 Start, ART, Jump and many more, Mzansi's popiano princess has evidently cracked the code to delivering a certified banger, as merely hours after its release, her latest song Is it is giving major 'song of the summer' vibes, as per social media users. Much like her previous hit-songs, this new tune has quickly made its way onto countless playlists, and has debuted at number six on Spotify's New Music Fridays playlist. Social media users have not stopped raving about the quality of the song, as well as the music video. They have also hailed the youngster for her consistent ability to pull off a successful roll out."

mov_35C6FBF52D705AC1B98101F9061EDB4C,2025-07-11 12:18:07,en,WEB,"  Topline: The PAC-MAN exhibit at Irvine's Great Park Gallery is designed to appeal to middle-agers who remember the game when it first came out — and their kids. Tell me more: The exhibit, “Journey Through the Maze: 45 Years of PAC-MAN,"" is a collaboration between the city and PAC-MAN creator Bandai Namco Entertainment, whose U.S. headquarters are in Irvine. You'll find memorabilia, early game sketch designs — and three old-school arcade games where you can brush up on your ghost-gobbling skills. Why now: Bandai Namco is using the occasion of PAC-MAN's 45th anniversary to drop a new PAC-MAN game, called Shadow Labyrinth, on July 18. Read on ... for more about the exhibit and some special events planned for the summer. My eyes frequently glaze over when my 10-year-old son bursts into my room to tell me about the latest Fortnite update, or a new video game he just has to have. This is probably unfair since I also think fondly back to my old summer days spent flopped on the carpet playing Pong, and nights at the local Pizza Hut popping quarter after quarter into the PAC-MAN machine to defeat those pesky (and adorable) little ghosts. Visit the PAC-MAN exhibit Address: 8000 Great Park Blvd., Irvine Hours: Noon to 4 p.m. Thursdays and Fridays; 10 a.m. to 4 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays Entrance and parking: Free! The PAC-MAN exhibit at Irvine's Great Park Gallery is designed to appeal to middle-aged me and my son. The exhibit, “Journey Through the Maze: 45 Years of PAC-MAN,"" is a collaboration between the city and PAC-MAN creator Bandai Namco Entertainment. The company's U.S. headquarters are in Irvine — one of the city's greater claims to fame, IMO. My son and I went to check it out this week. What's at the exhibit? The first thing you should do at the exhibit is make a beeline to one of the three old-school arcade games, where you can brush up on your ghost-gobbling skills before checking out the rest. Displays outline the history of the game and the evolution of the PAC-MAN franchise. Another wall is dedicated to reproductions of original sketch designs of the game. Adam Sabolick, who coordinates Irvine's arts programming, told me these are among the items at the exhibit he finds most inspiring. “It shows how these really simple drawings and concepts spawned into 45 years of cultural influence,” Sabolick said. There's lots of PAC-MAN memorabilia on display, including PAC-MAN cereal boxes and a manual game — unfortunately you can't play that one. And a lot of PAC-MAN themed art. That was Susie Chadwick's favorite part. “There's so many different perspectives on it,” she said. Her son Arthur, 9, and friend Gibson, 10, were less impressed. They spent the visit improving their PAC-MAN scores. What's next for PAC-MAN Bandai Namco is using the occasion of PAC-MAN's 45th anniversary to drop a new PAC-MAN game, called Shadow Labyrinth, on July 18. In it, a warrior is accompanied by a familiar-looking yellow orb named Puck — a nod to PAC-MAN's original Japanese name — as they battle and chomp their way through a dark universe. It looks, appropriately, much more sophisticated than the old-school PAC-MAN games. I'm not sure my gaming skills are up-to-date enough to try this new version, but I bet my son will be all over it. The exhibit runs through Sept. 28. [embedded content] Special upcoming events Saturday, July 12: 1 to 3 p.m.: The first 100 visitors will get a free, limited-edition PAC-MAN fingerboard courtesy of Slushcult. Saturday, Aug. 9: 1 to 3 p.m.: Industry professionals and game designers discuss their work and the cultural legacy of PAC-MAN."

That's right, I've finished all the rewrites!!! I'm taking a little pause before I start working on Chapter 10 to enjoy some of my Summer, watch some of the shows I've had on my backlog for a while (Frieren), and so as not to burn myself out. That said, my break definitely won't be long as I'm far too excited for you guys to see where I'm taking the story. I don't want to give a guess as to when Chapter 10 will be out because I suck a keeping deadlines, so I'll just keep you all updated on here whenever these fanfic fridays pop up. On a side note, I've thought long and hard on how to do the backstories for several characters in a way that does them justice, and I think I've landed on what I'm going to do. Whenever I hit the end of arc 3 in my story (chapter 50ish), the next chapters will be just a general synopsis on the backstories of some characters, but the full stories will be in a separate fanfic. That way, Bell can still remain the main focus of the story without having the story derail into a 50-chapter (I'm just throwing out a random number) flashback. More information on that separate fanfic will come way, way later (you can probably tell who the characters will be and what it will be about if you look at my most recent post(s)). Fanfic information: * Excluding the prologue, it follows the events of a hypothetical MS18. Because it's hypothetical, you won't be spoiled by the actual MS18 (say, for a few things). * The main ship is BellxAis. * There is an OC, but Bell is still the main character. * Spoilers up to MS17 and SO12. * I also try to be as loyal as I can to the material, but some alterations should be expected (this is still a fanfic after all) Fanfic Link (The top is Wattpad, and the bottom is fanfic.net) * [https://www.wattpad.com/story/332032079-danmachi-fated-hero-or-foolish-demise](https://www.wattpad.com/story/332032079-danmachi-fated-hero-or-foolish-demise) * [Danmachi: Fated Hero or Foolish Demise?

If the “Songbird Supreme” seems determined to ring in the season early, it's worth remembering: this wasn't always the plan. “I felt it was too early in my career,” Carey told The New York Times in a 2024 interview, reflecting on the moment her label pitched a Christmas album in the early '90s. But with a Casio keyboard, a brain full of bells, and a studio decked out in lights, she got to work. One night, she tapped out a melody — “ding ding ding ding ding ding ding ding” — and wrote what would become “All I Want for Christmas Is You.” Released in October 1994, the track went on to become the first holiday single to be certified Diamond in December 2021, spent more than 65 weeks on Billboard's charts, and was added to the Library of Congress' National Recording Registry in April 2023."

mov_329BE0DA3942D9FEBAADDF9198CD72A4,2025-07-11 15:19:35,en,WEB,"  If ever there was a synagogue that's earned the right to throw itself a birthday shindig, it's this elegant and intriguing house of worship in central Norway only 220 miles south of the Arctic Circle. Over the past century, the Trondheim Synagogue has weathered isolation from the rest of the Jewish world; the Holocaust, which wiped out half its community; challenges related to Shabbat observance because of its far northern latitude, and persistent antisemitism that has only grown worse since the war in Gaza began in 2023. This fall, the synagogue will be observing its 100-year anniversary with a three-day celebration, culminating with an Oct. 26 event which members of Norway's royal family, the country's prime minister, the mayor of Trondheim and other dignitaries are scheduled to attend. “There will be speeches, songs and, of course, we will tell the history of the community,” says John Arne Moen, president of the Trondheim Jewish Community. “We are on the outskirts of the Jewish world, living close to the polar circle. You will probably not find a community like ours any other place in the world.” With a population of about 200,000, Trondheim is Norway's third-largest city, behind Oslo and Bergen. Located on the shores of a fjord that's an inlet in the Norwegian Sea, the city was founded in the year 997 and was Norway's capital during the Viking Age. The city's most famous site is the Nidaros Cathedral, completed in 1300 at the burial place of King Olav II, who is credited with bringing Christianity to Norway. The unlikely story of Jewish life in Trondheim began in the late 19th century, when Jewish immigrants began arriving from Poland and Lithuania, usually because they couldn't afford to go to America. Many worked as traveling merchants. By 1900, there were more than 100 Jews living in Trondheim and the city's first synagogue was established. During the next 20 years, the community grew to more than 300 members, prompting the need for a larger synagogue. In 1923 an old railway station at Arkitekt Christies Gate 1 was purchased with the financial support of approximately 200 Jews from Oslo and converted into a synagogue. It was inaugurated in 1925 and remains — along with the synagogue in Oslo — one of only two synagogues in the country. The building, designed in the Neoclassical style, is fronted by a light-blue façade with arched windows and white molding. Inside, the two-story sanctuary also features a blue motif. Originally, women were seated in the balcony during services. Now, the balcony is no longer used; men and women sit together on the main floor. Germany occupied Norway from 1940 to 1945. The Nazis confiscated the synagogue and used it as a barracks, replacing the Stars of David in the windows with swastikas. It's believed that 165 local Jews — about half of Trondheim's Jewish population at the time — died in the Holocaust, fueled by robust collaboration by local authorities. Most of the victims were deported by train to the Auschwitz concentration camp in Poland, where only a few survived. Early efforts to memorialize the murdered Jews of Trondheim were undertaken by the remnants of the community that survived. But in the mid-1990s, the city embarked on its own memorial enterprise, choosing Cissi Klein — who was 13 when she was seized from her school, deported to Auschwitz and killed upon arrival — to become a symbol of Trondheim's Nazi victims. A statue of Cissi stands in a quiet park a short walk from the Trondheim Synagogue. Built in 1997 as part of the city's millennium commemorations, the memorial is located outside the apartment building where Cissi lived with her parents and brother. A street alongside the park has been named in her honor. Today, Moen estimates there are 200 Jews living in Trondheim; about three-quarters are members of the synagogue. Shabbat services are typically held every other Friday. The chief rabbi of Norway, Michael Melchior, lives in Israel but periodically travels to Oslo and Trondheim to conduct services. (Melchior's father was the longtime chief rabbi of Denmark.) When Melchior isn't in town, services are usually led by Israeli-born Asher Serussi, a religious leader in the community who has lived in Trondheim for 30 years. Serussi describes the Trondheim Synagogue as “Orthodox but very flexible and modern.” “Most of the people here are not observant Jews,” he said. “Our members are interested in the Jewish culture and traditions. But they don't keep kosher and they don't keep Shabbat. They enjoy very much when we have celebrations for holidays. Then it's a full house here.” For the more religious who follow halacha, or traditional Jewish law, the question about how to handle the starting and ending times of Shabbat has been a topic of debate ever since the congregation was founded in 1905. According to halacha, Shabbat begins a few minutes before sunset and lasts for 25 hours. But Trondheim is located so far north that the amount of daylight can vary between 20 hours in the summer and just four hours in the winter. So what's an Orthodox congregation to do in a country known as “the land of the midnight sun”? Other communities in far northern latitudes handle the issue in a variety of ways. Some set the Shabbat clock based on Jerusalem time, while others divide the day equally into two 12-hour segments. Some start Shabbat at the traditional moment, even if that means lighting candles around midnight. Moen says the congregation developed its own approach in its early years of existence that seemed to be palatable to its members and blessed by most of the Orthodox rabbis who have examined the question. For the Trondheim Synagogue, Shabbat begins at 5:30 p.m. on Fridays and ends at 6:30 p.m. on Saturdays, regardless of the time of year and whether or not there's sunlight or polar darkness. “It's been our rule for 120 years,” says Moen. “We have grown up with it...."

Absolutely soaked and too exhausted to move away when I wanted to get out. So, I hauled myself out on the pool edge next to him(?) , dried off, then used my towel to pick him(?) up in it and set him on the pool deck. Unfortunately he(?) was clinging to the towel, so I had to shake it, and he(?) fell off and ran under the fence back into the bushes. I didn't get bitten or scratched, but did touch him(?) for a second trying to make him(?) go. Washed the towel afterwards because I always do laundry on Fridays."

Amazon effectively created an unofficial “Summer Shopping Week” that every retailer wants a to be a part of. Major retailers launched their own overlapping summer deals events to compete during the same window. - Walmart's 6-day “Walmart Deals” sale - Target's week-long “Circle Week,” - Best Buy's revived a “Black Friday in July” sale - Newer players like TikTok Shop jumped in too, with one of the longest sales (spanning July 7–19) Prime Day might originate on Amazon, but as we are seeing, a huge chunk of shoppers are channel-agnostic during “deal week.” They will jump to Walmart, Target, or anywhere else if the price is right. According to Numerator, 63% of shoppers said they like the extended Prime Day format because it gives them more time to shop and find deals. Brands cannot deny the halo effect. There's no question Prime Day drives a huge surge in traffic. Prime Day 2025 has shown that our industry keeps evolving – from extended deal durations to a crowded competitive landscape to shifting consumer priorities (and even macroeconomic influences). For those of us in marketplace marketing, it's a reminder that we need to stay nimble and data-informed. The brands that win are the ones who truly understand their customers' behavior during events like this and pivot quickly! Excited to see how all the data shakes out next week and read the PoVs across brands and categories, and all the learnings we will take away going into preparing and planning for Q4! #ecommerce #AmazonPrimeDay #onlineretail"

It looks like in Coronation Street after she was taken to the police station. On Friday's (11 July) episode, following his accident, with the figure becoming confused after a nurse called him 'Chesney Winter-Brown' and said his wife had been visiting him. What to Read Next After getting in touch with wife Maria, Gary discovered that he had not only suffered a severe head injury, but also that a mystery woman had been posing as his wife. Maria confided in Lou about suspicious activity seen on Gary's bank card. Worried that her visits to the hospital as Gary's fake wife were about to be exposed, Lou panicked and slipped the card into Summer Spellman's bag. Lou then called the police and lied, saying that she'd witnessed an assault and knew who the culprits were in an attempt to set Summer and Nina Lucas up. The two friends were brought in for questioning - after previously - but it quickly became clear that Lou's story didn't add up. Meanwhile, Maria had rushed to be by Gary's bedside in hospital and checked the phone number his hospital 'wife' had been calling from. After becoming convinced that Lou was behind the deceit, Maria immediately searched for her. Lou tried to lie her way out of the confrontation, but made an error by mentioning the name of the shop where the crime took place. She was then led to the police station for questioning, though she still pleaded innocence. Brody found out about his mother's arrest and quickly called Mick in prison, who told him to keep his phone on as he would be needing his help. Will Lou be able to lie her way out of this one - or is the game finally up? Coronation Street airs on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays at 8pm on ITV1 and streams on .

There are actors (""Stranger Things' "" Joe Keery, Nat Wolff, Jason Schwartzman), the real guys (Stephen Malkmus), archival footage and irreverent stagings that help evoke the spirit of the band, and kind of tell its story, as unconventionally as possible. Writer-director Mark Anthony Green's debut movie ""Opus,"" a cult-​horror about a reclusive pop star and a mysterious retreat, did not receive the best reviews out of the Sundance Film Festival earlier this year. But it touts the kind of cast and intriguing premise that makes it a hard-to-resist curiosity, with Ayo Edebiri and John Malkovich leading, that is now streaming on HBO Max. In his review for The Associated Press, Mark Kennedy wrote, ""How both could be totally miscast will haunt your dreams."" Kennedy added, ""Green wobbles as he tries to land this plane and what had been an intriguing premise to talk about fame and the parasitic industries that live off it turns into a gross-out, run-for-it bloodfest and a plot that unravels."" - Lindsey Bahr, Associated Press Music The rap record of the summer is here.

And if that's not a strong enough co-sign, a quick look at the album's features will confirm its greatness: Kendrick Lamar, Tyler the Creator, Nas, Pharrell Williams, John Legend, the-Dream, Ab-Liva and Stove God Cooks. Nigerian superstar Burna Boy, a leading voice in Afrobeats, has released his eighth studio album, ""No Sign of Weakness,"" out now. It's a high-energy good time, as first made apparent in the percussion-heavy ""TaTaTa"" featuring rapper Travis Scott. It was one of the bestselling albums of all time. Backstreet Boys' 1999 boy band classic, ""Millennium,"" gets a facelift with the release of ""Millennium 2.0,"" out now. It's a deluxe reissue, now with a brand-new song, B-sides and live recordings. And that makes you larger than life. - Maria Sherman, Associated Press Television ABC's ""Bachelor in Paradise"" marks its 10th season this summer with a golden twist. Contestants from ""The Golden Bachelor"" and ""The Golden Bachelorette"" are sent to a resort in Costa Rica to have fun in the sun and possibly make romantic connections. There's also a number of younger ""Bachelor"" and ""Bachelorette"" cast members who randomly get added to the mix. Jesse Palmer hosts with Bachelor Nation favorites Wells Adams serving as in-house bartender and Hannah Brown, who is in charge of Paradise Relations, whatever that means.

Additionally, I have only 6 GB left in my plan, and I can't afford an upgrade. However, I will try to delete some old content to see if it helps. For the time being, I'm doing a book tag since it's fun and easy on my hands. The original creator is Heather from Bookables. Sand in your toes- A book that's perfect to read on the beach         A short and sweet female/female rom-com. Goodreads Blurb:     When skeptical engineer Alex Murphy's perfectly ordered world collides with mystical cruise director Luna Hartwell's cosmic chaos, sparks fly higher than the Northern Lights. Can a woman who believes in electromagnetic fields learn to trust in magic? Can a woman who reads tarot cards convince a scientist that love is the most powerful force in the universe? Aboard the lesbian cruise ship Sappho's Dream, opposites don't just attract—they create miracles that defy the laws of physics and prove that some equations balance perfectly when you stop trying to solve them and start living them instead. Summer thunderstorm- A book that truly spooked you         Some things I didn't see coming here. Goodreads Blurb:     Keep your enemies close...your sister closer...     To outsiders, twins Mia and Chloe have always been close, like good sisters should be. But in private their relationship is one of jealousy, resentment and bitterness. Popular and attractive Mia is always the centre of attention, loved by all. Quiet and reserved, Chloe is overlooked and underestimated, and has tried to build a life away from Mia and her manipulation. Finally she is happy and content. But then Mia returns and makes it clear that she wants to be part of her sister's life again, to have everything Chloe has...including her new fiancé Scott. Chloe can't allow Mia to ruin her life again. She's done this too many times in the past – always taking things that don't belong to her. As old tensions, secrets and lies return, tragedy strikes. And one sister will use the opportunity to live the life she has always wanted…the life she has always deserved. Heating up- A book that was seriously steamy         Goodreads Blurb:     Blue: When my ex walks into the resort bar with his new husband on his arm, I want nothing more than to prove to him that I've moved on. Thankfully, the sexy stranger sitting next to me is more than willing to share a few kisses in the name of revenge. It gets even better when those scorching kisses turn into a night of fiery passion. The only problem? Turns out the stranger's brother is marrying my sister later this week. Tristan: I have one rule: no messing with the guests at my vineyard resort. Of course the one exception I make turns out to be the brother of the woman my brother's about to marry. Now we're stuck together for a week of wedding activities, and there's no avoiding the heat burning between us. So fine, we make a deal: one week. One week to enjoy each other's bodies and get it out of our system. Once the bride and groom say I do and we become family, it'll all be over between us. Right? Rained out- a book that you were anticipating but was let down immensely         I couldn't connect with the characters, and for me, that is key. Goodreads Blurb:     Sully is ready to get out of Hearst, Pennsylvania. With a fashion internship secured, the gender-nonconforming eighteen-year-old is trading in their stifling small town for the big city. Sully even sells their beloved car, to Bread—er, Brad—the most boring (and maybe only other) gay kid in town. When Sully's internship goes up in smoke, they're trapped in Hearst with no cash—and no car. Desperate, they go to the thrift store, their personal sanctuary. There, they discover a vintage bag—like ""put this baby in an airtight case at the MET"" vintage. If Sully can authenticate it, the resale value would be enough for a new life in the city. But when they begin to investigate, Sully finds themself haunted. Literally. With the ghost of Rufus, a drag performer from the fifties with no memory of how he died standing—no, floating—in their bedroom, Sully's summer has a new 1) help this ghostly honey unlock his past and move on and 2) make bank—after all, the Real Real doesn't take poltergeist purses. With Rufus in tow, and Brad—who's looking pretty scrumptious these days—playing chauffeur, Sully delves into the history of the town they're so desperate to escape. Only to discover that there might be more to Hearst than they ever knew. Vacay mode- a book that features a vacation         A novella I'm slowly reading     Goodreads Blurb:     This is a story about a vacation. About getting lost at sea. About a girl who wasn't really a girl. And about a pair of red swim trunks that, somehow, saved her life...."

The plans for Chartist Tower, Upper Dock Street, Newport, were  on July 3. The new arcade, is situated in an archaeologically sensitive area, and will have access from Corn Street. It will operate from 4pm to 8pm on Fridays, and from 10am to 8pm on Saturdays, Sundays, and bank holidays. However, under a condition, the from 9am to 10pm all week. The site, once a retail spot, was later transformed into a space for restaurant use and then cinema pods with overnight stays. A significant aspect of the approval was its long-term vacancy and previous non-retail usage, which supported the green light for the new plans. Despite not fully complying with retail policy, economic and regeneration benefits were noted. Due to its self-contained nature and location in a mixed-use central zone, minimal impact on residential amenity is expected. While no external changes are proposed, signage will need separate consent. The site, although in a sensitive archaeological area, raised no objections from Heneb, known as The Trust for Welsh Archaeology, due to the scale of the proposed works. Natural Resources Wales also had no objections, despite the site falling within flood zones 2 and 3, but recommended awareness and resilience measures. Given its city centre location, no operational parking is required, and there were no objections from Highways. The arcade is expected to produce minimal waste, and it will have to adhere to a submitted waste plan. Although no biodiversity enhancements were proposed, a condition requires the submission and implementation of a biodiversity enhancement scheme. The application, led by M. Brown, saw no objections or comments from 140 neighbours and local councillors who were consulted. The arcade must adhere to the submitted plans, maintain the waste management strategy as per the submitted plan, and operate within the restricted hours of 9am to 10pm daily. According to the arcade's official website, it is expected to open later this summer on July 19."

But there has been something especially poignant in the stories of the campers, counselors, and staff from Camp Mystic who died last week in the Guadalupe River's floodwaters. We think of the years that should have been ahead of them, filled with laughter, learning, friends, new adventures, fun, frustration, love and heartbreak and love again. Hanna and Rebecca Lawrence were twin sisters who had just finished second grade. Their parents said in a statement, ""We are devastated that the bond we shared with them, and that they shared with each other, is now frozen in time."" Mary Grace Baker had just celebrated her first Communion. St. Anne Catholic school in Beaumont, Texas, said on Facebook, ""Her giggle was contagious, as was her spirit."" Eloise Peck and Lila Bonner were 8 and 9 years old. Eloise's mother, Missy Peck, told KDFW-TV that Eloise — known as Lulu — ""loved spaghetti but not more than she loved dogs and animals. She passed away alongside her best friend and cabinmate."" Chloe Childress was 18, and a fourth-generation Camp Mystic camper, back this summer as a counselor. The head of her Houston school said in a statement, ""Chloe made space for others to feel safe, valued, and brave."" Families who send their children off to summer camp miss them every day. But they also feel that being away, nestled into nature, will shelter their children and help them grow. Cody Crossman wrote a post on Facebook about losing his 8 year old niece, Hadley Hanna. Each detail pierces your heart. ""Sweet Hadley, I can't believe it. The joy you brought everyone with your smile and laughter can't be replaced. I will miss our Monday dance Hopdoddy milkshakes and just that time we got to spend together. I will always remember the last time I saw you, the night before you left. You said you were nervous, I said don't be, gave you double high five and hug and said Have Fun."" This week as Camp Mystic tries to make sense of its wrenching losses, the camp website cites the Book of Matthew: ""our Mystic girls will forever shine…. because you girls are the light of the world.""

A ""spray and go"" enzyme-based laundry stain remover that works its magic in one wash to help you instantly get rid of all that discolored dried sweat, oil stains, or deodorant residue on your favorite clothes, so you don't have to do any heavy scrubbing yourself. Check out a TikTok of the laundry spray in action. Puracy is a Texas-based, family-owned business specializing in plant-based, chemical-free, hypoallergenic home products, with a donation made to local families in need with a portion of every purchase. Psst — this spray also does a number on all those other miscellaneous stains in your life, like wine, coffee, soy sauce, makeup, and period blood! I recently bought this to test it for myself, and can attest to how well it works to get period blood out even after you've tried something else. I stained a pair of beloved bright-blue bike shorts in my sleep and tried to get it out with soap and water, but the stain was still there when it came out of the wash. I treated it with this, stuck it back in the wash, and BOOM, it's like it never happened (I panicked before I could get a before and after, please forgive me, laundry gods). Get it from Amazon for $6.99+ (available in different sizes). 2. A delightfully affordable instant foot peeling spray for anyone ready to go full YEEHAW!! on a pedicure, without the big salon price tag. This not only helps gently remove dead skin, but moisturizes dry and cracked heels, so you'll really get some refreshing bang for your buck.

With this, I simply spray it on and immediately massage it in with my hands. The dead skin comes off effortlessly. There's no waiting time, and it's gentle on the skin. It leaves my feet feeling exceptionally soft. This has quickly become my new favorite thing."" —KimT Promising review: ""Wow, does this work amazingly! I discovered this from a TikTok video, and I am so pleased with how this works. It is literally like magic; my feet have never been this soft."" —Brian Get it from Amazon for $5.39. 3. A holy grail 5-in-1 Edgelift Curl Brush to define curls, waves, and coils, help prevent frizz, and create precise parts and sections. Reviewers of all curl and wave types are just short of shouting in the comments about how they never found a brush that worked as well as this one, and parents are especially grateful for how easily this untangles their kiddo's hair! Bounce Curl is a small business that specializes in curl brushes. Check out a TikTok of the Edgelift Curl Brush in action. Promising review: ""Best brush hands down, I am a mixed girl with thick curly hair, and when I run this brush through my hair wet, it does magic. My curls after using this in the shower to detangle are amazing, then I use my choice of product to style it row by row, and it gives me bouncy curls that help cover more scalp but separate effectively. It's extremely sturdy. I break brushes all the time, and this one lasts!!!"" —Janay K Get it from Amazon for $29.99 (available in four colors) 4.

mov_F309F046BC65841D237EEE9A124AB48E,2025-07-12 13:05:22,en,WEB,"  By Beth Wood Published: July 12, 2025, 6:05am Share One of the city of Vancouver's annual summer events is Friday Night Movies in the Park. On the first four Fridays in August, the city will host a different family movie, each in a different park. This year's movies are: “Coco,” “Moana 2,” “E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial” and “Barbie.” Refreshments are usually available for purchase, and the movies start around dark. It's a fun way to spend an evening outside in the summertime. The Kiggins Theatre is also hosting its annual “Grease” singalong today and Sunday. If you can't make it to the parks or theater, you can always check out DVDs from the library and have a movie night at home. Personally, I love musicals — you just can't beat the uplift you get from a great song-and-dance number. The library has many old favorites available to rent, like “The Sound of Music” and “West Side Story” (old and new versions), as well as some older titles and lesser-known musicals that you may not have seen: From Rodgers & Hammerstein: “Cinderella,” “Carousel,” “South Pacific” and “The King & I.” “Into the Woods” by Stephen Sondheim. Silver Screen Icons series: Broadway Musicals and Astaire & Rogers, Vol. 1 & 2 — each of these collections contains four musicals. “Jailhouse Rock” and “Viva Las Vegas” starring Elvis Presley. “Pitch Perfect 1-3” and “High School Musical 1-3.” And of course, Disney movies! Musicals not your thing? Pick a genre, and have a film festival — monster movies, or Hallmark romances both hold many options. Get the kids to dress up and have a '60s night or an '80s night. We also have lots of TV series to binge watch. Monster movies: “The Blob,” “Godzilla,” “Nosferatu: Symphony of Horror” and “Alien.” Movies from the 1960s: “Psycho,” “2001: A Space Odyssey,” “My Fair Lady” and “Butch Cassidy and The Sundance Kid.” Movies from the 1980s: “Valley Girl,” “The Breakfast Club,” “The NeverEnding Story” and “Back to the Future.” BBC TV shows to binge: “Doctor Who,” “The Office” and “All Creatures Great and Small.” Cartoons you watched as a kid: “Mr. Peabody & Sherman,” “Scooby-Doo! ,” “Hey Arnold” and “SpongeBob SquarePants.” If you're a true movie geek, ask your audience questions after the film. Which was your favorite “Breakfast Club” character and why? Was “The Blob” alive and how do you know? If you had a Tardis from “Doctor Who,” where and when would you travel? Which song from which musical best describes you?"

The online retailing powerhouse – and tech giant – said Prime Day 2025, which ran from July 8-11, was its biggest ever, the company announced Saturday, July 12, in a news release. Amazon's 11th Prime Day drove record sales and a record number of items sold, larger than any previous four-day period that included a Prime Day event, the company said. (The promotion became a two-day affair in 2019; this year, Amazon expanded it to four days for the first time.) U.S. online spending during Prime Day's four days amounted to an estimated $24.1 billion, according to Adobe. Its Adobe Analytics sales data tracks online transactions across U.S. retail sites. The data, which is aggregated and anonymized, doesn't directly track Amazon's sales but does reflect overall spending and suggest Prime Day demand. How did Amazon Prime Day 2025 compare to Black Friday 2024? Spending for Prime Day amounted to ""more than two Black Fridays – which drove $10.8 billion in online spending during the 2024 holiday shopping season – and sets a new benchmark for the summer shopping season,"" Adobe said in a news release. The total also surpassed Adobe's pre-Prime Day estimate of $23.8 billion in sales. Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle.

The dance floor of Tent La Spang is full. Everyone dances together on the rolling Kaseko music of the Surinamese formation Amantare. Every year Jules Lieveld comes from Spijkenisse to the Kwaku Summer Festival in the Bijlmer. Kwaku started a football tournament fifty years ago. He played football from the first edition in 1975, with his Amsterdam cousins: “We were the Lieveld Boys”. In the meantime, in the four weekends of the festival, a total of between 120,000 and 150,000 visitors. Kwaku is the place where Surinamese Antilian Netherlands meets. Jules Lieveld can't walk twenty meters or he meets someone. Between the dozens of eating stalls with flutter (the stomach of a cow in spicy broth), meat sausage and shavings sounds music everywhere. “Cozy, cozy, cozy!” The MC at Tent Waterkant calls through the speaker that is at a maximum volume. The football slowly disappeared from the program. At the back of the Nelson Mandelapark is still a football field where the youth plays matches of four to four up to the age of sixteen. Football was once the heart of the Kwaku Festival, but has become less important. Photo Simon Lenskens Zoom in Allan Sedney (51) came to Kwaku every weekend as a little boy. It has changed in those years, he says: “It is better arranged now and you also see ultra Dutch families here good food and enjoyment, I like that.” Today he is encouraging his son Yves (11) at the field. The Rotterdam Yves loses a shoe but still scores twice. He did not yet know his three teammates from Krommenie, Hoofddorp and Amsterdam. “We make a team here and then we become friends, that's how it goes every year,” says Yves. We make a team here and then we become friends, that's how it goes every year Yves (11) Footballer on Kwaku Pillars as changing rooms “To understand how Kwaku originated, you must understand the history of the Bijlmer,” says co-founder Roy Groenberg (72). In 1963 the municipality started the construction of the new, promising district Bijlmermeer. Ten years later, a large part of the 18,000 homes were empty, the white middle class families for which the neighborhood was intended remained away. In the run -up to the independence of Suriname in 1975, many Surinamese people come to the Netherlands and to the Amsterdam Bijlmer. Among them Groenberg, who came to Amsterdam in 1973: “There was nothing to do in the Bijlmer, we were closed off from the rest of Amsterdam.” The promised metro was not yet laid out, there were no supermarkets. This is how evening shops and hairdressing shops were created from basement boxes. Groenberg, who then follows a training as a socio-cultural worker, founded the Kwakoe Jongerencentrum Foundation in 1975. In the summer most children go out of the city, the Surinamese children do not go on holiday. Together with the late Dennis Rust, he organizes the first six -week football tournament on the lawn for those who stay behind, where the Amsterdamse Poort shopping center now stands.

mov_44E1ABAE892F0349F8A1A25A99E90F5B,2025-07-13 15:31:32,en,WEB,"  Dexter: Resurrection will see the return of a fan-favorite Miami Metro character from the original series. Dexter: Resurrection is one of the biggest shows of the summer as it continues the story of a beloved fictional serial killer played by Michael C. Hall. Weeks after being shot by his own son, Dexter emerges from a coma and heads to New York City to try to make things right with his kid. Unfortunately, he is being haunted by his past as Angel Batista returns to investigate Dexter under suspicion of being the Bay Harbor Butcher. It's hardly an unfamiliar plot line, but it's one that is made more dramatic given the two decades of history and current circumstances. The first episode of Dexter: Resurrection was jam-packed with cameos of characters from Dexter's past. Not only is he reconnected with the ghost of his father who will be by his side the whole season, but he also has some heart to hearts with the Trinity Killer, Miguel Prado, and James Doakes. It is expected that other Dexter characters will pop up later in the show, but there have still been some question marks with regards to a few key characters from Dexter's past. Earlier this year, Dexter actor Desmond Harrington was asked whether he was going to return as Joey Quinn in Dexter: Resurrection . He got very cagey and wouldn't confirm nor deny anything. People took this as a not-so-subtle hint that Harrington would return. The first two episodes of the show have aired and he hasn't popped up yet, calling into question when and if he will appear. Dexter: Resurrection Will Bring Back Joey Quinn , Confirms Desmond Harrington  dexter However, a new teaser for the rest of the season was released and eagle-eyed fans think they spotted Quinn. In a blink and you'll miss it shot, we see a Miami Metro police car with a detective standing over a body in the background. The detective is out of focus, but his body and stance look just like Quinn. Desmond Harrington took to Instagram to confirm it, posting the image and saying he couldn't say anything more. He thanked the creative team for bringing him back, confirming he is in Dexter: Resurrection . It's unclear just how large his role will be, but this is sure to excite fans. Quinn is one of the best characters from the original show and has a very interesting history with Dexter. Not only did Quinn hire someone to investigate Dexter, but he also dated Deb. He was in love with her up until she died and was willing to turn a blind eye to Dexter blatantly murdering her killer for revenge. Some have questioned over the years whether Quinn really knows the truth about Dexter . Either way, if Quinn is getting involved, he will likely find out that Dexter is alive and that may drum up some drama. If he finds out the truth, he could become motivated to take Dexter down as a way of avenging Deb. There's a lot of potential for something really intense here, but we'll just have to wait and see how it all unravels. Dexter: Resurrection has plans for at least three seasons , so even if Quinn doesn't become a main player this season, he could in the future. The show is already a massive hit with fans and critics alike. It has one of the highest ratings on Rotten Tomatoes of the entire Dexter franchise, holding a strong 90%. We gave Dexter: Resurrection a 4 out of 5 in our review , praising it for its thrilling drama, blending the old with the new, and offering a brilliant character study for Dexter Morgan. Dexter: Resurrection airs Fridays on Paramount+. What characters do you want to see return? Let me know in the comments.
