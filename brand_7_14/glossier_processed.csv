my0atkg,2025-06-16 01:35:53,en,REDDIT,"  Holistically, I wouldn't recommend the lip IV. There are many Korean makeup brands like Romand that will give you a better or similar finish and feeling and cost less (Yesstyle). I was initially bought into the Lip IV thing from influencers promoting it as something that would last all day. Short story, it did not. Maybe two hours at best, but definitely not the all day wear that was advertised. Secondly, the colour did not match the photos. This is always a problem so that's alright with me but instead of getting a warm shade, I got a neutral shade which was unexpected, since I bought the product because I hoped it would be warm. However the most pressing issue is the fact that IT MELTS and SEPERATES. If you heard of the Glossier oil separation thing (which I do not recommend for the same reason), it's basically the same. I recently just tilted down my gloss and all of the colouring just dropped out. I barely have any left and I have to blend it manually on my lips now AND it has turned even more cold-toned since, I suspect, the warm tint has melted away. Overall, 1/5. I had the product for 2 months and it turned out like this. I'm not sure why either--I haven't placed it in direct sun. Just in my drawer or purse. For anyone who wants that matte-like finish, I would recommend the Fwee melting pots and or Peripera mood tints."
mov_2B4816E89ADDF27DE1DEB0529051137D,2025-06-16 03:18:33,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]LONDON (IT BOLTWISE) – In der heutigen digitalen Welt, in der Kundenerwartungen durch globale Marken geprägt werden, können es sich Startups nicht leisten, die Kundenerfahrung zu vernachlässigen. In der dynamischen Welt der Startups ist die Kundenerfahrung ein entscheidender Faktor, der oft unterschätzt wird. Viele Gründer glauben fälschlicherweise, dass sie sich erst nach Erreichen eines bestimmten Wachstums darauf konzentrieren sollten. Doch diese Denkweise kann sich als fataler Fehler erweisen. Die Erwartungen der Kunden werden nicht nur durch direkte Wettbewerber, sondern durch die besten Erfahrungen mit globalen Marken wie Amazon oder Netflix geprägt. Diese setzen hohe Standards, die auch für lokale Startups gelten. Besonders im Nahen Osten, wo die Technologieakzeptanz hoch ist, steigen die Erwartungen der Verbraucher rasant. Startups in Städten wie Riad oder Abu Dhabi stehen nicht nur im Wettbewerb mit lokalen, sondern auch mit internationalen Giganten, die erhebliche Mittel in die Gestaltung nahtloser Kundenerlebnisse investieren. Diese Herausforderung bietet jedoch auch eine enorme Chance: Startups, die frühzeitig die Bedeutung der Kundenerfahrung erkennen, können sie zu einem Wettbewerbsvorteil ausbauen. Ein weit verbreiteter Irrglaube in der Startup-Welt ist, dass die Optimierung der Kundenerfahrung erst nach dem Erreichen des Produkt-Markt-Fit erfolgen sollte. In Wirklichkeit bildet die Kundenerfahrung die Grundlage für organisches Wachstum, Loyalität und Markenunterscheidung. Wenn das Budget für Marketing knapp ist, zählt jeder Nutzer. Wer zu lange wartet, riskiert, den Anschluss zu verlieren. Ein Beispiel für ein erfolgreiches Startup, das von Anfang an auf Kundenerfahrung gesetzt hat, ist Ounass. Mit einer Plattform, die kuratierte Mode mit einer eleganten Benutzeroberfläche und schnellem Lieferservice kombiniert, hat Ounass früh Vertrauen und Loyalität aufgebaut. Diese Investitionen in die Kundenerfahrung haben sich als Wachstumsmotor erwiesen. Die Realität zeigt, dass reibungslose Kundenerfahrungen ein Wachstum generieren können, das allein durch Marketingbudgets nicht erreicht werden kann. Ein positives Erlebnis führt nicht nur zu wiederkehrenden Kunden, sondern auch zu Mundpropaganda. Airbnb und Glossier sind Beispiele für Unternehmen, die durch gezielte Investitionen in die Kundenerfahrung und das Zuhören ihrer Kunden erfolgreich gewachsen sind. Viele Startups stolpern jedoch über häufige Fallstricke. Sie schaffen fragmentierte Kundenerlebnisse, ignorieren wichtige Momente nach dem Kauf oder versäumen es, Feedback-Schleifen zu etablieren. Startups haben den Vorteil der Agilität und können schnell auf Kundenfeedback reagieren, was größere Unternehmen oft nicht können. Ein herausragendes Beispiel aus der Region ist Cafu, ein On-Demand-Treibstofflieferdienst in den VAE. Durch die Implementierung von Echtzeit-Tracking und proaktiven Benachrichtigungen hat Cafu das Kundenerlebnis erheblich verbessert und eine loyale Kundenbasis aufgebaut. Obwohl Technologie, insbesondere KI, die Kundenerfahrung verbessern kann, ist der menschliche Kontakt weiterhin entscheidend. Unternehmen sollten nicht vergessen, dass Menschen sich daran erinnern, wie sie sich gefühlt haben, nicht wie schnell ein Chatbot reagiert hat. Für Gründer ist es wichtig, die eigene Kundenerfahrung aus der Perspektive des Kunden zu betrachten und kontinuierlich zu verbessern. Ein einfacher Anruf oder eine persönliche Nachricht an Kunden kann wertvolle Einblicke liefern und die Grundlage für eine starke Kundenbindung schaffen.

urn:li:share:7340429804581584896,2025-06-16 17:27:24,en,LINKEDIN,"  Changing Marketing Dynamics with Examples Marketing dynamics have drastically evolved, driven by rapid technological advancements, shifting consumer expectations, and digital platforms. These changes have transformed how businesses reach audiences and how consumers interact with brands. Several key trends illustrate this shift: 1. From Traditional to Digital Marketing Earlier, marketing relied on TV, radio, and print ads. Today, digital marketing dominates. The Coca-Cola Company for example, shifted a large portion of its budget toward digital—focusing on online video ads, social media, and influencers for real-time engagement and precise targeting. 2. Rise of Social Media Marketing Social media is now essential. Brands interact directly with customers instead of just broadcasting messages. Nike uses Instagram and TikTok to collaborate with athletes and influencers, creating authentic content that resonates with younger audiences. Viral challenges and user-generated content amplify engagement. 3. Personalization and Data-Driven Marketing Consumers expect tailored experiences. With data analytics and AI, companies customize content and offers. Amazon recommends products based on browsing and purchase history, boosting conversions and satisfaction. Spotify's “Wrapped” campaign gives users fun, shareable insights, strengthening loyalty. 4. Influencer and Creator Economy Influencer marketing has surged. Brands like Glossier, Inc. built their model around micro-influencers and customer testimonials instead of traditional ads. This peer-to-peer marketing fosters trust and authenticity, especially with Gen Z and Millennials. 5. Content as the New Currency Consumers seek informative or entertaining content. Brands like Red Bull operate like media companies—producing extreme sports videos, podcasts, and documentaries that align with their identity. This content builds brand narrative without direct selling. 6. Privacy and Ethical Marketing With growing data privacy concerns, companies must balance personalization with transparency. GDPR and Apple's App Tracking Transparency have reshaped data practices. Apple even uses privacy as a core marketing message in its campaigns. 7. Shift to Omnichannel Experiences Customers expect seamless interactions across physical and digital touchpoints. Starbucks delivers this through its app—offering order-ahead, rewards, and payment integration for a unified brand experience. In summary, marketing has shifted from static, mass-based tactics to dynamic, personalized, and interactive strategies. Companies embracing digital tools, respecting privacy, and engaging meaningfully are better poised for long-term success in a competitive, connected world. #MarketingDynamics #DigitalMarketing #SocialMediaStrategy #Personalization #DataDrivenMarketing #InfluencerMarketing #ContentMarketing #OmnichannelExperience #BrandEngagement #ConsumerExpectations #MarketingTrends #TechInMarketing #CustomerInteraction"

Created by Jason Keller, the series stars Owen Wilson as Pryce Cahill, a washed-up former golf pro who's now a grumpy club salesman. After his wife left him and he was fired from his job, Pryce is at his lowest point when he is persuaded to coach a talented teen golfer Santi Wheeler (Peter Dager). Although Santi is a talented player, he quit the sport after his father walked out. What starts as a reluctant partnership between Wheeler and Pryce gradually becomes a journey of redemption, trust, and second chances. With dry humor, awkward team dinners, and touching moments of growth, transforms the quiet world of golf into something moving. The supporting cast includes Lilli Kay as a bartender, Mariana Treviño as Santi's mother, and Marc Maron as Pryce's ex-caddy and confidant. Fans of will find similar warmth and laughs in these seven sports comedies. Exclusive preview to the hottest show this season RIGHT HERE. , and more sports comedies like Apple TV's 1) (2022) A League of Their Own (Image via Amazon) reimagines the 1992 film of the same name with new characters and a richer focus on identity, ambition, and love. Set in 1943, the new show follows Carson Shaw (Abbi Jacobson) and her team the Rockford Peaches as they break barriers in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. It also sees Max Chapman (Chanté Adams), a Black pitcher, fight for a chance to play despite being shut out due to her race. Like Apple TV's , the show uses sports to explore themes of being queer, being underdogs, and facing the struggle to belong. While goes toward comic anarchy, balances drama and comedy to illustrate that sports are about participation and not always about winning. Where to watch: Amazon Prime Video 2) (2025-Present) Running Point (Image via Netflix) When an ex-party girl Isla Gordon (Kate Hudson) is put in charge of her family's professional basketball team, the Los Angeles Waves, she isn't the only one who is surprised. The fast-paced Netflix comedy follows Isla as she deals with deal with family rivalries, player drama, and office politics while proving that she is more than just a party girl. The show was made by Elaine Ko, Mindy Kaling, Ike Barinholtz, and David Stassen. has a great cast including Drew Tarver, Scott MacArthur, Brenda Song, and Chet Hanks. Where to watch: Netflix 3) (2025-Present) Ted Lasso (Image via Apple TV) Jason Sudeikis stars in the sports comedy-drama on Apple TV+ as a perennially hopeful American football coach. He has been recruited to oversee the fictional English soccer team AFC Richmond—despite having no soccer expertise. Originally a sabotage scheme hatched by team owner Rebecca Welton (Hannah Waddingham), what starts as a negative story turns into a story of belief, progress, and kindness rapidly changes. Much like Apple TV's , celebrates misfits who rise through camaraderie, not just talent. Both shows thrive on quirky humor, sports chaos, and emotional growth—proving that the real win is learning to stick together, no matter the game. Where to watch: Apple TV 4) (1996) Happy Gilmore (Image via Amazon Prime Video) Adam Sandler's turns golf into chaotic comedy gold. Sandler plays Happy, a failed hockey player with a killer drive who joins the PGA Tour to save his grandma's home. His wild antics clash with golf's prim traditions—most memorably in a legendary brawl with Bob Barker. Packed with offbeat humor, underdog charm, and absurd training montages, echoes the tone of Apple TV's , where unpolished athletes shine in unlikely sports. Directed by Dennis Dugan and co-written by Sandler, the film was a box-office hit and remains a cult favorite in the golf world. With a sequel set to reportedly release in 2025, there's no better time to revisit this sports-comedy classic. Where to watch: Apple TV, Hulu, Netflix 5) (2015-2019) Ballers (Image via HBO) The sports comedy-drama tracks retired NFL great turned business advisor for pro athletes, Spencer Strasmore. Played by Dwayne Johnson, Spencer helps athletes control fame, money, and personal challenges while negotiating the glittering and competitive world of sports business. Like Apple TV's , explores the realm of sports off of the field by fusing comedy with real-life issues players off the field encounter. While leans into the ridiculousness of amateur floorball, offers a glossier, high-stakes look at professional sports. However, both catch the emotion, pressure, and friendship that make sports stories so interesting. Where to watch: HBO..."
mov_CE064C57656C08D65B6C3F8F5C5F3C2C,2025-06-17 16:27:23,en,WEB,"  Seven short months of globbing onto countless sandwiches, and now one of the most notable CPG launches of the past year is making its strongest squeeze yet. Ayoh! Foods, the flavor-focused condiment company from chef Molly Baz, enters Whole Foods Market stores nationwide. “[Ayoh!] is a colossal project,” Baz tells me. “I am so grateful that people are chasing the product, recognizing its quality, and helping us get there so quickly.” Ayoh! Foods also reveals that it has raised a $4.5 million seed round, $3.3 million of which is new cash, led by Imaginary Ventures. In addition to its Dill Pickle, Hot Giardinayo and Tango Dijonayo varieties, Ayoh! will launch its flavored products on Whole Foods shelves with an exclusive flavor to the natural grocer, a brand new umami-rich flavor. “I saw a white space in the marketplace,” Baz adds. “I am committed to solving problems in the food industry and delivering deliciousness at all costs.” Sandwich Shop To Countertop Jeff Mauro better make some room on the throne, because Baz keeps a close eye on each and every sandwich accoutrement possible. The venture for her particularly started during the pandemic. “I became very sandwich obsessed,” she says. On her social media accounts, she's practically made condiments her entire personality, even starting a sandwich podcast where she would dissect the necessary minutia of the likes of tuna melts, BLTs and PB&Js. From a Philly cheesesteak to a Chicago hoagie to a reuben at a New York deli, there's personal pride in each corner of the country that makes people feel at home with their sandwich of choice. Ayoh! capitalizes on that. “I'm a huge fan of Chicago style giardiniera,” Baz says about her inspiration behind her punchy pepper Hot Giardinayo sauce. “When I stir this giardiniera into the mayo, all of a sudden the mayo becomes so much more dynamic.” Ayoh! is a practical extension of those beloved staples. “We're really trying to bring that sandwich shop to countertop moment at home,” says Ayoh! Foods cofounder and CEO David McCormick. That intention that the brand was founded on is working in real time. Baz has found that Ayoh! customers are not only using it in their homemade sandwiches, but they're bringing their deli-bought sandwiches home so that they can specifically squeeze Ayoh! onto it. “For me,” she says, “that's the ultimate success story of Ayoh!” Not Just Another Celebrity Brand Her pulsecheck that there was a vacuum specifically in “dialed up, super bold-flavored, textured sando sauces,” as Baz puts it, seems to have been accurate, because consumers from the coasts to middle America are making it a staple in their homes. “We sold out four months worth of inventory in two weeks,” says McCormick. “It was almost 100,000 pounds of Mayo.” More than 170,000 bottles of Ayoh! have been sold since launch. And Ayoh! has proven that it's not some coastal craze. “Early indicators when we launched showed there's plenty of momentum in the Midwest…that's really important to us,” McCormick says. “We'll win the day if we can actually be just as popular in Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee. The great thing is there's a lot of affinity for mayo throughout the US.” That's something rarely seen in celebrity brands, but Baz and McCormick have managed to unlock genuine authenticity. “Nobody sat down in a room and looked at categories and thought about the gaps…Molly was like, 'some people I know make boring sandwiches.' It's just that easy.” Ayoh's timely resonance also allowed the brand to raise a relatively quick seed round, the capital of which will go towards expanding the Ayoh! team, broadening brand presence, and facilitating wider distribution. “[Imaginary Ventures has] some incredible portfolio companies of the likes of Skims and Glossier,” McCormick says. “For them to be interested in a mayo company, I think sends a really strong signal in terms of what we're building here.” Flavor And Format..."

mydq7q0,2025-06-18 02:37:41,en,REDDIT,"  You have such beautiful green eyes! I think the suggestions of softer eyeliner and warmer colors are great and spot-on. I also believe there's significance in what we choose—Dita Von Teese had a cute story about how everyone has their own drag I still remember from the old days of Into the Gloss—and honestly, your look does highlight your eye color really well. That said, just to shake things up one day, I'd love to see you in a no eye-makeup or brown mascara only look with a rich, warm rosy lip and strongish peach cream blush. I think it would be quite youthful and pretty on you. Maybe try a sheer foundation too that's got a bit of glow to it (like a good bb cream, tinted moisturizer, or skin tint—there are some great Korean brands for this like Misha if you don't want to spend a fortune, though if you like a touch more coverage, I could see you liking Chanel Vitalumiere Aqua too if it's not out of budget). Similarly, you might like a sheer champagne highlight like the one from Glossier or Violette, just so a little more of your own skin shines through a bit and to give a more muted glow. You're lovely though and can rock this look forever if you want, but I hope you get some fun inspiration and maybe pick up a few new colors!"

mov_9A48718CF4B7DF59A7DBFCBA0CBF21C4,2025-06-19 09:59:57,ar,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[ar]بقلم جورج الفغالي، عضو مجلس الإدارة ونائب الرئيس التنفيذي للاستشارات وتطوير استراتيجيات النمو في شركة CXG، المتخصصة في تصميم وتطوير تجارب العملاء للعلامات التجارية. خلال حديث مع مؤسس إحدى الشركات الناشئة، هزّ كتفيه بلا مبالاة حين سألته عن استراتيجيتهم لتحسين تجربة المستخدم، وأجاب قائلاً: ""سنهتم بذلك لاحقًا، عنما نتوسّع"". لم تكن هذه الإجابة التي وددت سماعها. فانتظار اللحظة المناسبة للاستثمار في تحسين تجربة المستخدمين (CX) لا يُعدّ استراتيجية، بل مخاطرة حقيقية. في الحقيقة، توقعات العملاء اليوم تجاوزت حدود المقارنة بينك وبين منافسيك المباشرين في السوق المحلي، وأصبحت تتأثر بأفضل تجربة عاشها المستخدم مع أي علامة تجارية، أيًا كانت، سواء كانت سهولة الطلب من أمازون، أو دقة توصيات نتفليكس، أو الاهتمام الخاص الذي يقدّمه موظفو المتاجر الراقية، فهذه هي المعايير التي يحاكم بها أداء شركتك الناشئة. في الشرق الأوسط، حيث يتمتع المستهلكون بوعي عالٍ ويواكبون التطورات التكنولوجية بسرعة لافتة، أصبحت توقعاتهم في ارتفاع مستمر. فالشركة الناشئة في الرياض أو أبو ظبي لا تنافس فقط نظراءها المحليين، بل تدخل في سباق مع عمالقة عالميين يستثمرون بكثافة في تصميم تجارب سلسة ومتكاملة للعملاء والمستخدمين. قد يبدو هذا التحدي مربكًا للبعض، لكنه في الحقيقة فرصة واعدة: فالشركات الناشئة التي تدرك هذا مبكرًا، يمكنها أن تحوّل تجربة المستخدم إلى مصدر تفوّق حقيقي. تجربة المستخدم ليست رفاهية يمكن تأجيلها من أكثر المفاهيم الخاطئة ضررًا في عالم الشركات الناشئة هو الاعتقاد بأن تحسين تجربة المستخدمين يمكن تأجيله إلى ما بعد التوسّع، أي أن الشركة تصل أولًا إلى مرحلة تلبي فيها احتياجات السوق، ثم تُسرّع وتيرة النمو، وتعود لاحقًا لمعالجة جوانب تجربة العملاء. لكن في الواقع، تجربة العميل هي الركيزة الأساسية للنمو الطبيعي لأي علامة تجارية، إذ تساهم في ترسيخ ثقة المستخدمين وبناء ولاء طويل الأمد للعلامة التجارية والتميّز وسط المنافسين، خصوصًا حين تكون الميزانيات التسويقية محدودة ولا مجال لخسارة أي عميل. الانتظار قد يعني أنك لن تصل إلى تلك المرحلة أبدًا. لنأخذ منصة Ounass  كمثال. منذ اليوم الأول، جعلت Ounass من تجربة المستخدم محورًا أساسيًا في رؤيتها وطريقة تقديمها للخدمة. تجمع المنصة بين أزياء مختارة بعناية، وواجهة استخدام أنيقة، وخدمة توصيل في اليوم نفسه داخل المدن الكبرى، إلى جانب خدمة دعم عملاء تمنح المتسوقين شعورًا بالعناية الشخصية رغم اتساع نطاق العمل. كما أدمجت المنصة تفاصيل مدروسة بعناية -من التغليف الفاخر إلى سهولة إجراءات الإرجاع- لتُقدّم تجربة تمزج بين سهولة التسوق التي اعتدناها من عمالقة التجارة الإلكترونية مثل أمازون أو نون، وبين الفخامة والاهتمام بالتفاصيل. لقد ساهمت هذه الاستثمارات المبكرة في ترسيخ الثقة وبناء ولاء طويل الأمد مع المستخدمين. العميل السعيد هو أفضل حملة تسويقية الواقع أن تجربة المستخدم السلسة قادرة على دفع عجلة النمو بطريقة لا تستطيع الميزانيات التسويقية وحدها تحقيقها. حين يحظى العميل بتجربة ممتازة، فإنه لا يكتفي بالعودة، بل يحدّث الآخرين عنها. وهذا بالضبط ما حدث مع شركةAirbnb  في بداياتها. فقد قام المؤسسون بزيارة أصحاب العقارات في نيويورك بأنفسهم، وساعدوهم في تحسين صور الوحدات السكنية وتنسيقها، بل وقاموا بصياغة الإعلانات معهم. هذه الاستثمارات المباشرة في تجربة المستخدم انعكست بسرعة في شكل حجوزات أعلى وتوصيات شفهية إيجابية. وخذ مثالًا آخرGlossier، شركة التجميل الناشئة التي تحوّلت إلى علامة تجارية عالمية. بدأت المؤسِّسة إميلي فايس من مدونة  ""Into the Gloss""، حيث أنشأت مجتمعًا من القارئات، ثم طوّرت منتجاتها استنادًا إلى ما كانت تقرأه وتسمعه منهن. شعر العملاء أنهم مسموعون، وأنّ رأيهم يصنع فارقًا. هذا الارتباط العاطفي تحوّل إلى ولاء، وجزء كبير من مبيعات Glossier  جاء من التوصيات الطبيعية لا الإعلانات. هذه الأمثلة ليست استثناءات نادرة. صحيح أنك بحاجة إلى منتج أو خدمة ممتازة، لكن تجربة العميل هي ما يمنح هذا المنتج تأثيره الحقيقي. عندما تُصمَّم التجربة بعناية منذ البداية، تصبح واحدة من أقوى محرّكات النمو القابلة للتوسّع لأي شركة ناشئة. أخطاء شائعة أين تتعثر الشركات الناشئة عادة؟ أولًا، في خلق تجارب مجزأة. فقد يبدو الموقع الإلكتروني ممتازًا، لكن تجربة التوصيل بطيئة وغير مُرضية، أو قد يكون التسجيل والاستخدام الأول سلسًا، لكن لا وجود لأي دعم أو متابعة بعد ذلك. تذكّر: العميل لا يتعامل مع علامتك التجارية كمجموعة من الأقسام المنفصلة، بل يعيش تجربة واحدة شاملة، وكل نقطة احتكاك قد تصنع فارقًا. ثانيًا، إهمال ما بعد البيع. فكثير من الشركات الناشئة تركز بشكل مفرط على جذب العملاء، كنها تغفل عن المرحلة الأهم: الحفاظ عليهم. قد يكون التغليف ركيكًا، أو عملية الإرجاع مربكة، أو يُقابل المستخدم بصمت تام بعد إتمام الشراء. كل ذلك كفيل بأن يفقد العلامة التجارية زخمها. لا تقع في هذا الفخ: فالتجربة المميزة لا تنتهي عند الدفع، بل تبدأ من هناك. وثالثًا، غياب آليات التغذية الراجعة. الشركات الناشئة تتحرك بسرعة، لكن التحرك دون الاستماع للمستخدمين يُعد مجازفة. إن لم تكن تستمع باستمرار لعملائك -سواء من خلال استبيانات، مراجعات، أو تتبع لما يُقال على المنصات -فأنت تعمل في الظلام. والقاعدة هنا بسيطة: الشركات التي تستمع وتتعلّم وتتجاوب، هي من تنجح وتبقى في الصدارة.  تجربتك أسرع وعميلك أقرب تتمتع الشركات الناشئة بميزة حقيقية تتمثَّل في قدرتها على الحركة بسرعة ومرونة. فهي لا تحتاج إلى فرق عمل ضخمة أو أنظمة إدارية معقدة كي تقدّم تجربة مستخدم متميزة. ما تحتاجه فعلاً هو عقلية واضحة، وثقافة تنظيمية تُعطي تجربة المستخدم أولوية منذ اليوم الأول -ثقافة تعتبر ملاحظات العملاء وسيلة للتطوير، لا تهديدًا، وتؤمن بأن تجربة العميل مسؤولية الجميع، من فريق المنتج إلى التسويق إلى خدمة العملاء. من خلال عملي مع عدد من أبرز العلامات التجارية الفاخرة عالميًا،

Grab a sample PDF of this report: https://www.imarcgroup.com/hand-cream-market/requestsample Our report includes: ● Market Dynamics ● Market Trends And Market Outlook ● Competitive Analysis ● Industry Segmentation ● Strategic Recommendations Growth Factors in the Hand Cream Market ● Rising Awareness of Skincare and Hygiene: Increasing consumer awareness of skincare and hygiene is a significant growth factor in the hand cream market. People are becoming more educated about the importance of maintaining healthy skin, especially on their hands, which are exposed to environmental stressors like UV rays, pollution, and frequent washing. This awareness has been amplified by global health campaigns emphasizing hand hygiene, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, brands like L'Occitane have capitalized on this trend by promoting their shea butter hand creams as both moisturizing and protective, appealing to consumers seeking products that align with their heightened focus on self-care and skin health. Social media platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok, further drive this trend by showcasing skincare routines, encouraging consumers to invest in premium hand creams. ● Demand for Natural and Organic Products: The growing preference for natural and organic products is fueling the hand cream market's expansion. Consumers are increasingly wary of synthetic chemicals like parabens and sulfates, opting instead for formulations with plant-based ingredients, such as aloe vera, coconut oil, or essential oils. This shift is driven by a broader movement toward sustainability and eco-conscious purchasing decisions. For instance, Burt's Bees has gained popularity with its beeswax-based hand creams, marketed as environmentally friendly and free from harmful additives. Retailers like Whole Foods and Sephora have also expanded their natural skincare sections, making these products more accessible. This trend reflects a cultural shift toward holistic wellness, boosting demand for clean-label hand creams. ● Innovation in Product Formulations and Packaging: Continuous innovation in product formulations and packaging is a key driver of the hand cream market. Brands are developing specialized creams targeting specific concerns, such as anti-aging, hyperpigmentation, or extra-dry skin, to cater to diverse consumer needs. Additionally, convenient and aesthetically pleasing packaging, like travel-sized tubes or sleek dispensers, enhances product appeal. For example, Neutrogena's Norwegian Formula Hand Cream offers concentrated hydration in compact packaging, ideal for on-the-go use. Companies are also experimenting with eco-friendly packaging, such as biodegradable tubes, to attract environmentally conscious buyers. These innovations not only improve user experience but also differentiate brands in a competitive market, driving consumer loyalty and sales. Key Trends in the Hand Cream Market ● Premiumization and Luxury Branding: The trend toward premiumization is reshaping the hand cream market, with consumers willing to invest in high-end products that offer a luxurious experience. Premium hand creams often feature exotic ingredients, sophisticated fragrances, and elegant packaging, positioning them as status symbols. For instance, Dior's Miss Dior Hand Cream combines skincare with its iconic floral scent, appealing to luxury beauty enthusiasts. Department stores like Nordstrom and high-end retailers like Net-a-Porter have seen increased sales of such products, as consumers treat hand creams as indulgent self-care items. This trend is particularly strong among millennials and Gen Z, who value experiential purchases and share their luxury finds on social media. ● Growth of Gender-Neutral and Inclusive Products: The rise of gender-neutral and inclusive products is a prominent trend in the hand cream market. Traditional marketing often targeted women, but brands are now creating unisex formulations to appeal to all genders, focusing on functionality over stereotyped aesthetics. For example, Aesop's Reverence Aromatique Hand Balm, with its minimalist packaging and universal appeal, has become a favorite among diverse demographics. This shift aligns with broader societal moves toward inclusivity, encouraging brands to use neutral scents and avoid gendered language in marketing...."

mov_9522A2EA8BC0B2D970BAC0637CF452DF,2025-06-20 16:43:34,en,WEB,"  2025 has been an exciting year for high performance OLED televisions and it's not even half over yet. We've seen an entirely new OLED panel design from LG Display, the Primary RGB Tandem OLED panel, offering a big improvement in brightness, which has previously been OLED's Achilles Heel. . And Samsung Display has refined their own OLED panel (QD-OLED) with improved brightness and performance as well. LG's WRGB panel uses white, red, green and blue OLED sub-pixels, while Samsung uses blue OLED pixels with a Quantum Dot color layer for color reproduction. Each approach is valid but Samsung's QD-OLEDs have historically been a bit brighter than LG's WRGB OLEDs and offer a wider color gamut and higher color volume, which can be seen on some 4K/HDR content. In 2025, Samsung's latest QD-OLED panel is included in Sony's BRAVIA 8 II, as well as in Samsung's S90F and S95F OLED TVs (up to 77 inches). The S95F is a strong performer for video quality, but it's unique glare-free screen has drawn some criticism from consumers due to black level performance in bright rooms. The Samsung S90F and Sony BRAVIA 8 II use a glossier screen which maintains solid black levels in brighter rooms, but at the expensive of some on-screen glare and light reflection. Meanwhile, LG's latest Quad Stack Tandem RGB OLED panel is featured in LG's G5 and M5 OLED TVs in 2025. The G5 in particular has received rave reviews this year for its high peak brightness, in both full screen mode and in a smaller 10% test window. Our friend Al Griffin over at Tech Radar measured the G5's peak brightness in Vivid mode at over 2500 nits. Even in the more accurate Filmmaker mode, the TV put out over 2260 nits in a 10% window. We've seen the G5 and M5 up close at LG events at CES and at their NJ headquarters and can confirm that it's a stunning performer. But the LG G5 and M5 aren't the only TVs that use LG Display's new Quad Stack Tandem RGB OLED panel. Panasonic, who pulled out of the US TV market in 2016 after the demise of plasma TVs, is also using LG Display's new OLED panel in their upcoming Z95B flagship OLED TV. Panasonic is putting its own twist on the new panel, not just with its video processor but with a highly effective cooling system they call “ThermalFlow.” This system uses the chimney effect to passively draw heat from the panel out through the top of the TV through air vents. The ThermalFlow system should allow the TV to reach even higher peak brightness levels without running too hot. The system is passive, so you won't have to worry about the whir of fans in the background. The Z95B includes two up-firing drivers and two side-firing drivers as well as a built-in subwoofer. Panasonic has also tweaked the audio performance thanks to a partnership with the company's Technics Hi-Fi brand. Up-firing speakers on the TV are now both higher and wider apart than they were on last year's model, adding to a much improved sense of width and spaciousness on Dolby Atmos content. Instead of going with the wow factor of a super-skinny panel with a big bump at the bottom for inputs and outputs, they opted instead for a uniformly thick panel with plenty of cabinet volume for audio performance. This cabinet designed is also critical for the ThermaFlow heat management system. She Thicc. Side profile of last year's Z95A compared to the Z95B. They've even got built-in beam-forming audio so you can direct the TV's sound to specific parts of the room. This can be helpful when you're working from home while your toddler wants to watch “SpongeBob SquarePants” in all his 4K/Dolby Vision Glory… repeatedly. Our society has peaked. Even SpongeBob is now available in 4K with Dolby Vision HDR. We got a chance to spend some quality time with the Z95B at Panasonic's US headquarters in NJ earlier this week up against last year's model and liked what we saw (and heard). Its predecessor, the Z95A was highly regarded among reviewers and consumers though we did not have a chance to review it at eCoustics. It used LG's MLA (micro lens array) tech to boost the panel's brightness, but the Z95B bested it in both white and color brightness producing a noticeably brighter and more saturated image. Though not obvious in the picture, the Z95B (right) offers significantly higher white and color brightness than last year's Z95A. While Panasonic exited the US TV market in 2016, the company has continued making and selling TVs in Asia, Europe and other markets. So they haven't exactly been standing still in the picture processing department (something they've always been well-known for). Their current generation processor, the HCX PRO AI Processor, Mark II, is on-board to handle video processing and upconversion. In addition to the flagship OLED TV, Panasonic is planning to introduced a flagship MiniLED TV as well as a more budget-friendly “Core LED” LCD TV model in the U.S. later this year. Last fall, the company returned to the US market with the Z85A and Z95A OLED TVs. I was impressed enough with the Z85A that when it fell to $999 for a 65-inch model, I bought one myself. It replaced a smaller Panasonic plasma, which is actually still going strong. But the improvements in resolution, brightness and overall operation were huge. No buyer's remorse here. Advertisement. Scroll to continue reading. Panasonic Z85A OLED TV (2024 model). Some folks (ahem, Caleb Denison) may criticize Panasonic for choosing the Amazon FireTV OS, but as a long time FireTV user myself, I have found nothing to complain about on the Z85A. There are some video ads which can display on the home screen but these can be disabled in the settings menu if you find them annoying or obtrusive. Google TV might have been a better choice, but honestly either platform provides a quick and robust interface with tons of options for streaming...."

e799c2b8e272eadb3ae76bbc429c9dde,2025-06-24 04:03:00,en,WEB,"  This week, I checked in on the burgeoning beauty supplement category. Additionally, Unilever is set to acquire men's personal care leader Dr. Squatch, there's another exec shakeup at Violet Grey, and Beautycounter founder Gregg Renfrew is back with Counter. The beauty supplement marketplace is expanding again Part of this growth is driven by consumer behavior formed during the Covid-19 pandemic. “In 2019, retail sales were at $26.2 billion [for vitamins and supplements], but as the pandemic pushed health and immunity into the spotlight, the market surged by 22.1% to reach $32 billion in 2020,” David Hamlette, health and wellness research analyst at Mintel market research company, told Glossy. “This initial boom continued into 2021, with sales climbing to $34.8 billion. However, as pandemic-related concerns began to ease, so did the rapid growth.” The market slowed significantly in 2022, up just 0.6%, followed by 3.5% growth in 2023 to reach $36.2 billion. Growth in 2024 is estimated to have been around 3.2%. “While the explosive growth of the early pandemic period has tapered off, the category has now stabilized and continues to see a gradual, sustainable rise,” Hamlette said. “The good news is that consumer interest in health and wellness remains strong.” For some brands, reaching this evolving supplement consumer means adding beauty benefits into the mix. The beauty supplement category has traditionally included vitamins and drink mixes benefitting the hair, skin and nails but has more recently grown to include supplements targeting cellular health, the microbiome and gut, all of which impact our outward appearance. “Beauty and wellness is collapsing in on each other,” Henry Davis, CEO of Sakara Life, told Glossy. “It is an artificial divide that retailers have put in place.” Davis — who led Glossier as president and COO from 2014 to 2018 and joined meal delivery company Sakara in 2023 — has big ambitions for the beauty category. On Monday the company launched Beauty Biome, a $65 daily capsule supplement that targets gut health for healthier skin, at the retailer Credo. “Over 90% of our clients have been asking us for supplements and over 75% have been asking us for beauty [offerings],” Davis said. Sakara debuted its supplement line in February with offerings that target cell health, sleep and metabolism. But Beauty Biome, and its distribution through Credo, is a more direct leap into beauty. “We're very focused on an all-body [approach], and the biggest organ in your body is skin, so that's something we're obviously very focused on and interested in,” Davis said. “It's a very natural and obvious opportunity for us to do more [in beauty], and Beauty Biome is our step in that direction. [We're] really trying to collapse these categories in on each other and be the people that tell that story.” But the merging of beauty and wellness isn't necessarily new. For example, L'Oréal-backed Timeline, a Swiss company launched in 2020 and known for a proprietary molecule said to increase cell longevity through ingestibles, launched a line of moisturizers called Timeline Skin Health in 2023 to complement its oral supplements. A representative for the brand told Glossy that Timeline has seen high double-digit growth so far this year. That's partially been driven by its newest launch, The Eye Cream, which retails DTC for $150 and is powered by the same anti-aging compound found in its vitamins. According to Mintel market research company, just under half of supplement users surveyed this year have also taken a beauty supplement. However, the majority of beauty supplement consumers surveyed agree that regular health supplements are just as effective in maintaining their appearance. “Beauty supplements are currently perceived as a 'nice-to-have.' … To establish itself as a 'must-have', the category will need to advance science-backed messaging and demonstrate proven effectiveness,” Joan Li, beauty and personal care senior analyst at Mintel, told Glossy. “High-income adults, particularly those aged 55 and older, are showing a growing interest in products designed to promote anti-aging benefits, improve skin firmness and boost elasticity,” said Mintel's Hamlette. Many oral vitamin brands have also expanded the beauty supplement category. For example, MaryRuth Organics, a liquid vitamin line launched in 2014, entered the beauty supplement space in 2022 with a biotin hair gummy followed by a $75 sugar-free liquid vitamin for hair health the next year. The latter is currently a bestseller, and in April, the company expanded the line to include new flavors. This offering has been clinically tested to improve hair growth and reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Collaborations and partnerships have also been category drivers. For example, Skin Laundry, the laser facial provider, and Nutrafol, the beauty supplement brand backed by Unilever, just announced a new partnership to promote an inside-outside acne treatment protocol. It includes a recommendation for laser treatments and oral supplements. The campaign, which will run through August, includes special promotions for brand clients who patronize the partnering brand. As previously reported by Glossy , vitamin therapy was first used in Western medicine in the early 1900s to treat issues like rickets or scurvy, but it wasn't until the 1970s that vitamins gained mass popularity. The category is projected to reach $239 billion by 2028, according to Research and Markets . Executive moves: Tracy Kline is the new group president of specialty beauty retailer and content site Violet Grey. Her CV includes nine years at Macy's-owned Bluemercury, most recently as its head of merchandising and spa. Byredo founder Ben Gorham is leaving the brand. Gorham founded the luxury fragrance brand in 2006 and sold it to Spanish beauty conglomerate Puig in 2022. Luca de Meo is the new CEO of Gucci-owner Kering. He previously served as CEO of carmaker Renault Group. François-Henri Pinault previously held the CEO role at Kering and will stay on as chairman of the board of directors...."

New product features use AI to deliver personalized, cross-channel experiences based on individual customer preferences all from one platform. Unveiled live at K:LDN, Klaviyo's flagship European event, the launch gives global brands like Castore, AS Beauty, and Paul Smith a first look at what's possible for true omnichannel marketing. Built on the Klaviyo Data Platform (KDP)—which processes over 2 billion daily events across 7 billion+ customer profiles—this release addresses a core problem: fragmented tools and slow decision-making. Marketers can now run campaigns across email, SMS/RCS, push, WhatsApp, and mobile, all from one place, without waiting on integrations or syncs. In a market where budgets are tight and attention is scarce, this gives teams the ability to move faster, cut waste, and prove real-time impact, without adding cost or complexity. “Klaviyo has completely transformed how we operate. We're no longer guessing what works—Klaviyo AI helps us move faster, make smarter decisions, and drive better results,” said Max Holland, Senior CRM Manager at Castore. “As a fast-growing brand, we need tech that keeps pace with our team and our customers. It's not just about managing channels anymore—it's about unlocking new ways to connect as we scale.” What's New: Redefining Omnichannel Marketing Klaviyo's latest innovations give marketers full control of their omnichannel strategy—powered by real-time data and designed for growth. Omnichannel Campaign Builder (in beta, GA in Q3): a brand-new canvas inside Klaviyo for marketers to plan, launch, and measure complex, multi-day campaigns across email, SMS/RCS, push and WhatsApp. With built-in insights and AI-optimized delivery, teams can execute faster, reduce costs, and increase ROI—without switching tools or duplicating work. Channel Affinity powered by Klaviyo AI (GA): AI automatically learns each customer's preferred channels and time to engage, then delivers messages where and when they're most likely to convert. Native Support for WhatsApp and RCS (in beta, GA in Q3): Allows brands to reach customers where they already are with rich, interactive messages that boost engagement and drive action—all without leaving the messaging app. Multi-Touch Attribution (GA on June 30): Provides real-time visibility into what's driving revenue, not just what got the last click—so you can invest in what's really working. Why Now: The Market Has Changed Consumer shopping behavior is more complex than ever, moving across channels and devices. But most martech stacks weren't built for that. Marketing teams lose time switching between systems and reconciling disconnected data. Klaviyo removes the friction by bringing customer data, content, orchestration, and reporting into one platform. New Klaviyo research* shows the cost of inaction: 54% of consumers ignore brand messages in at least one channel, waiting for better offers elsewhere 77% shop across three or more channels and they expect brands to deliver a connected, personalized experience across all of them Consumers switch channels based on time of day, with email and SMS preferred most in the morning, and apps or social in the evening In this new reality, precision, timing and orchestration aren't optional, they're a requirement. “Marketing isn't broken—but the way brands have been forced to do it is,” said Andrew Bialecki, CEO and co-founder of Klaviyo. “We're giving consumer businesses a fundamentally better system: one that's built on real-time insights, doesn't sacrifice scalability or performance, and helps them operate the way consumers behave: fluidly, across channels, in real-time.” “The biggest mistake brands make is assuming customers behave logically. They don't—and never have,” said Rory Sutherland, Vice Chairman, Ogilvy. “In an omnichannel world, success depends on your ability to adapt to how people actually act, not how you wish they behaved. Brands that cling to outdated models of consistency and control will be outpaced by those that embrace nuance, and real-time responsiveness.” Channel Affinity is currently GA and available globally to all Klaviyo customers with Multi-touch Attribution scheduled to GA on June 30. Other capabilities are currently in beta and will be going live later this year. *The Klaviyo 2025 Online Shopping Report surveyed 2000 consumers globally About Klaviyo Klaviyo (NYSE: KVYO) is the only CRM built for B2C brands.

tw_sl_29420909dde81b0704c3b73d2c1a2d37,2025-06-24 11:06:53,en,WEB,"  At a pristine, multimillion-dollar lab on the Manhattan waterfront, just down the street from a men's homeless shelter and the medical examiner's office, a slice of summer plum is being converted into fragrance code. This is the work of Osmo, a fragrance tech startup claiming to build artificial olfactory intelligence. Osmo has parlayed this innovation into offering turnkey fragrance compounding that promises a 48-hour sample turnaround from initial client prompt. In the time it takes your Amazon Prime order to arrive, you may now order a custom perfume. Traditionally, creating a fragrance isn't fast. After a client provides a brief — usually a mood, memory, or concept — a perfumer begins weeks or months of formulation trials, compounding and revising dozens of modifications, or “mods.” Each must settle before it can be evaluated for balance, projection, and drydown. Raw materials often need years of cultivation. Bottling, regulatory reviews, packaging, and testing follow. From concept to shelf, a single perfume can take six to 18 months — even longer in luxury. And like fine wines, fragrance materials vary with climate concerns. One year's yield will not smell like the next one, or the one before. Osmo built its shiny new empire, hoping to disrupt the fragrance market, on its digitization of a plum and the speed with which it can analyze and transport odor molecules. Its goal: to disrupt the fragrance market with AI-powered scent creation. I first encountered the smell of this “digitized plum” at a scent conference, handed to me by an independent perfumer like contraband. A group gathered around the blotter, whispering: it was too medicinal, too clean. “Where's the bruising, the rot — the heat?” someone asked. “Where's the craftsmanship? Where's the perfumer?” I've judged hundreds of perfumes blindly for international fragrance awards and worked on machine learning systems at tech startups. I know the pull of scent well formulated — and the allure of tech's frictionless promises. To me, the plum smelled real, if strangely large and genetically modified. I could smell it from yards away — James and the Giant Plum, rolling toward me from a Roald Dahl retelling. But the question hanging in the air was larger than a fruit: as AI enters perfumery, are we expanding access to beauty — or automating the soul out of it? AI isn't coming to fragrance — it's already here, and in most things that the average consumer smells. The four fragrance conglomerates responsible for most of what the world smells — DSM-Firmenich, Givaudan, IFF, and Symrise — all integrate AI into their pipelines. Givaudan's Carto system helps perfumers refine formulas. DSM-Firmenich's EmotiON claims to produce scents that improve well-being. These systems are used not just in product labs but in fragrance education worldwide. The hairsprays and soaps and cleaning products and luxury fragrances that line your shelves — all of these have been touched by these four powerhouses of perfume and, so too, the AI involved in their processes. The principal perfumer at DSM-Firmenich, Frank Voelkl, who is behind the fragrances that make up so much of our current odor aura — Le Labo's Santal 33, Glossier's You, Tom Ford's Tuscan Leather — uses AI on a daily basis as part of his creative process. “When I began as a perfumer, there were no emails — we were still communicating with fax machines, you know. I started by handwriting my formulas. The beauty of AI is that it manages regulatory concerns, issues around stability, phasing, performance. These tools are tremendously helpful in resolving technical issues so I can focus much more on the creative part, which requires my imagination, emotions, intuition, and the human factor. It's like a clerk.” Heather, a perfumer-in-training in France, tells me AI use is now standard among her peers. “Most, if not all my classmates, have used AI for every project or question. Gen Z uses it like an operating tool — older generations use it like a browser.” When Heather says Gen Z uses AI “like an operating tool,” she means they rely on it as a functional extension of the creative process — from selecting materials to refining accords. Older generations, meanwhile, still treat it as a secondary resource, like a search engine or inspiration board. For new creators, AI isn't just assistance — it's infrastructure, taking over essential parts of the perfumery processes. Pierre Vouard, a professor at FIT, sees both opportunity and loss: “Compounding by hand, knowing the exact amount of each material, weighing it yourself — that's going to disappear. But is it crucial?” He knows AI is used in his own classroom. “Perhaps this will be true democratization of fragrance because it drastically reduces the cost of creating one. But it does make you ask: Where's the craftsmanship? Where's the perfumer?” “There've only been about 100,000 fragrances ever made...."

(Wyze Photo) Melissa Kirmayer Eamer, who spent nearly 20 years at Amazon, including as vice president of the company's Devices division, is the new president and chief operation officer at Wyze, the Seattle-area maker of smart-home security cameras and more. Kirmayer Eamer adds to the Amazon pedigree at Kirkland, Wash.-based Wyze, which was co-founded in 2017 by three veterans of the tech giant — CEO Yun Zhang, CMO Dave Crosby, and CPO Dongsheng Song. After leaving Amazon in 2019, Kirmayer Eamer spent a year as COO at beauty supply company Glossier before founding wellness/longevity clinic Modern Age, which was acquired in 2024. “Amazon is a massive company, and in the 20 years that I was there I really started to miss that startupy feel of chaos and sort of building from scratch,” she told GeekWire. She called Wyze a “perfect combination” of what she was looking for. “The co-founders have the Amazon DNA of starting with a customer and working backwards,” Kirmayer Eamer said. “And they have this business that's really built on the combination of hardware and magical software and making people's lives better.” Wyze originally started with security cameras but expanded to various other smart-home devices, now offering more than 70 different products, from light bulbs to vacuums to scales. The company raised $110 million in 2021 and ranks No. 18 on the GeekWire 200 list of top Pacific Northwest startups. Kirmayer Eamer, who oversaw product development and sales for Amazon's Kindle and Echo, said her goal is to lean on her experience from Amazon and help Wyze get to the next level and scale the business. “When I think of the future of really being able to monitor what's going on with your safety, with your security, with your well-being, there's so much more surface area for us to cover,” she said. “I'm really excited to help bring accessible devices into all of those segments.” Kirmayer Eamer's appointment follows a series of new product innovations from Wyze, including AI-powered video search capability and a “NBD” Notifications Filter which uses AI-enabled descriptive alerts to identify events that are “no big deal,” only sending notifications for events worthy of attention. Earlier this month Wyze released the Bulb Cam, which combines a lightbulb with a security camera to turn any light fixture into a motion-activated surveillance object. For its part, Amazon offers a variety of its own competing smart-home security devices from its subsidiaries, Ring, which it acquired in 2018, and Blink, which it acquired in 2017.

LaMonica McIver pleaded not guilty Wednesday to federal charges accusing her of assaulting and interfering with immigration officers outside a New Jersey detention center during a congressional oversight visit at the facility. ""They will not intimidate me. They will not stop me from doing my job,"" she said outside the courthouse in Newark after the brief hearing. McIver, a Democrat, was charged by interim U.S. Attorney Alina Habba, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump, following the May 9 visit to Newark's Delaney Hall. Immigration and Customs Enforcement uses the privately owned, 1,000-bed facility as a detention center. This month she was indicted on three counts of assaulting, resisting, impeding and interfering with federal officials. Two of the counts carry a maximum sentence of up to eight years in prison. The third is a misdemeanor with a maximum punishment of one year in prison. During Wednesday's hearing, McIver stood and told U.S. District Judge Jamel Semper: ""Your honor, I plead not guilty."" The judge set a Nov. 10 trial date. Outside the courthouse, McIver warned that anyone who pushes back against the Trump administration will find themselves in a similar position. McIver's lawyer, former U.S. Attorney for New Jersey Paul Fishman, said McIver pleaded not guilty because she is not guilty. He said federal agents created a risky situation at Delaney Hall. A message seeking comment Wednesday was left with Habba's office. Among those at McIver's side Wednesday were her family and elected officials, including Newark Mayor Ras Baraka, who was outside the detention center with McIver and other legislators on May 9. Baraka was also arrested on a trespassing charge that was later dropped and is suing Habba over what he called a malicious prosecution. Baraka accused the Trump administration of using law enforcement as ""an appendage of their ideology to begin to hammer us."" The indictment of McIver is the latest development in a legal-political drama that has seen the Trump administration take Democratic officials from New Jersey's largest city to court amid the president's ongoing immigration crackdown and Democrats' efforts to respond. The prosecution is a rare federal criminal case against a sitting member of Congress for allegations other than fraud or corruption. A nearly two-minute video clip released by the Department of Homeland Security shows McIver at the facility inside a chain-link fence just before Baraka's arrest on other side of the barrier, where other people were protesting. McIver and uniformed officials go through the gate, and she joins others shouting that they should circle the mayor. The video shows McIver in a tightly packed group of people and officers. At one point her left elbow and then her right elbow push into an officer wearing a dark face covering and an olive green uniform emblazoned with the word ""Police."" It is not clear from police bodycam video if the contact was intentional, incidental or the result of jostling in the chaotic scene. The complaint alleges that she ""slammed"" her forearm into an agent and then tried to restrain the agent by grabbing him. The indictment also says she placed her arms around the mayor to try to stop his arrest and says again that she slammed her forearm into and grabbed an agent...."
mov_7784A45273CA1F41162B8C330AFDBBA9,2025-06-25 16:31:31,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]SEATTLE / LONDON (IT BOLTWISE) – Melissa Kirmayer Eamer, eine erfahrene Führungskraft mit fast zwei Jahrzehnten Erfahrung bei Amazon, hat eine neue Herausforderung angenommen. Sie ist nun Präsidentin und COO des Smart-Home-Startups Wyze, das sich auf Sicherheitskameras und andere intelligente Haushaltsgeräte spezialisiert hat. Melissa Kirmayer Eamer bringt eine beeindruckende Karriere bei Amazon mit, wo sie unter anderem als Vizepräsidentin der Geräteabteilung tätig war. Ihre neue Rolle bei Wyze, einem aufstrebenden Unternehmen im Bereich Smart-Home-Technologie, markiert einen bedeutenden Schritt in ihrer beruflichen Laufbahn. Wyze, das 2017 von ehemaligen Amazon-Mitarbeitern gegründet wurde, hat sich schnell einen Namen gemacht und bietet mittlerweile über 70 verschiedene Produkte an, darunter Sicherheitskameras, Glühbirnen und Staubsauger. Nach ihrem Abschied von Amazon im Jahr 2019 war Kirmayer Eamer als COO bei Glossier tätig und gründete später die Wellness-Klinik Modern Age, die 2024 übernommen wurde. Ihre Rückkehr in die Startup-Welt bei Wyze beschreibt sie als eine perfekte Kombination aus ihrer Erfahrung und ihrer Leidenschaft für innovative Technologien. Sie sieht in Wyze die Möglichkeit, die von Amazon geprägte Kundenorientierung mit der Dynamik eines kleineren Unternehmens zu verbinden. Wyze hat sich von einem Anbieter von Sicherheitskameras zu einem umfassenden Anbieter von Smart-Home-Geräten entwickelt. Das Unternehmen hat 2021 eine Finanzierung von 110 Millionen US-Dollar erhalten und rangiert auf Platz 18 der GeekWire 200-Liste der führenden Startups im pazifischen Nordwesten. Kirmayer Eamer plant, ihre umfangreiche Erfahrung aus der Zeit bei Amazon zu nutzen, um Wyze auf die nächste Stufe zu heben und das Geschäft weiter zu skalieren. Ein zentraler Aspekt ihrer Strategie ist die Erweiterung des Produktsortiments von Wyze, um den wachsenden Bedürfnissen der Verbraucher nach Sicherheit und Wohlbefinden gerecht zu werden. Sie betont die Bedeutung von zugänglichen Geräten, die das Leben der Menschen verbessern können, und sieht großes Potenzial in der Integration von KI-gestützten Funktionen, wie der kürzlich eingeführten AI-Video-Suchfunktion und dem „NBD“-Benachrichtigungsfilter. Die jüngste Innovation von Wyze, die Bulb Cam, kombiniert eine Glühbirne mit einer Sicherheitskamera und verwandelt jede Leuchte in ein bewegungsaktiviertes Überwachungsgerät. Diese Art von Produktentwicklung zeigt, wie Wyze versucht, die Grenzen der Smart-Home-Technologie zu erweitern und gleichzeitig die Benutzerfreundlichkeit zu gewährleisten. Während Amazon mit seinen Tochtergesellschaften Ring und Blink ebenfalls im Bereich der Smart-Home-Sicherheit aktiv ist, sieht Kirmayer Eamer in Wyze eine einzigartige Gelegenheit, sich durch innovative Lösungen und eine starke Kundenorientierung zu differenzieren. Ihre Vision ist es, Wyze als führenden Anbieter in der Branche zu etablieren und die Art und Weise, wie Menschen mit ihren Smart-Home-Geräten interagieren, grundlegend zu verändern.

Kuumba Made is a small business that specializes in luxury scents at affordable price points. Promising review: This is my absolute favorite scent. I heard of this from someone I follow on TikTok and figured I would try it out. I fell in love with it the second I put it on. The scent is nice, not super strong, which I like because most perfumes bother my allergies. The scent lasts for a while. One bottle lasts me a few months. I recommend this scent to all my friends. I have tried other scents from this brand, but I think this one is the best. "" —rich allen Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (and check out the rest of Kuumba Made's scents for more options!) . 2. Lumify Eye Drops, a product so beloved by TikTok that despite being more $ than other brands, it's the number one selling brand on Amazon right now. Reviewers swear by this for instant reduction in redness in their eyes, with visible differences within a minute of use. Learn more about different kinds of eye drops and what they can do at Cleveland Clinic. Note that eye drops can potentially mask symptoms of eye conditions, so you should talk to your eye doctor about what's right for you. And according to Mayo Clinic, you should avoid redness-reducing drops if you're looking for dry eye relief. Check out a TikTok of the eye drops in action. Promising review: ""I have a big spot of blood vessels in the inner corner of my left eye. I use the expensive lubricant eye drops for moisture — I've used Visine, Clear Eyes, you name it. No eye drop has made my eyes look this great. Only Lumify! I was soo happy when I looked in the mirror and saw some beauty in my eyes instead of darkness and redness."" —Angela Leonard Get it from Amazon for $11.93. 3. A limited edition (!!) Eos Marshmallow ""Super Balm"" lip treatment from the brand's ""secret menu"" so good that reviewers say it's better than Carmex for healing and better than Summer Fridays for quality. Lip care that also tastes like you're perpetually eating a s'more for less than $5?? My friends, life is good. Check out a TikTok of the marshmallow lip treatment in action. Promising review: ""My new must-have! My number one go-to for healing lips was Carmex. This beat it. I love the consistency (very creamy/smooth), it's not heavily flavored or goopy, and it obviously smells amazing. It isn't overbearing and also doesn't keep coating your mouth like the Eos stick balms (still great, but more wax)."" —Breanah Shirazi Get ti from Amazon for $4.99 (also available in Strawberry Acai). 4.

mov_535854A8B342EF32BB8B347E80D67BED,2025-06-27 04:29:16,en,WEB,"  Netflix began its Africa operations in South Africa in 2016. When the US streaming giant announced it was setting up shop in Nigeria in 2020, many west African film-makers, writers, artists and media audiences were jubilant. Finally, west Africa's creativity and brilliance would be formally recognised on the world stage. Netflix Naija's purpose was to produce local content for Netflix just like Netflix South Africa and later Netflix Kenya. Read more: Netflix Naija: creative freedom in Nigeria's emerging digital space? Some film-makers have been wary of US cultural imperialism happening through the market dominance of Netflix and other US streamers. Others have rushed to the streamer to sign deals that will gain their films and TV shows a global audience. Netflix's interest in African stories comes with a colonial power dynamic that research and scholarship has not fully explored. As a scholar of media and communication, I recently examined the effect US streamers are having on the stories being told in films in Nigeria and Ghana. In my study, I argue that despite the growing global interest in African pop culture, African creative workers need to be careful about interest from global conglomerates. We can't talk about African cinemas going global without paying attention to how Hollywood's colonial relationship with Africa has shaped and influenced what African filmmakers believe will sell globally. Read more: Black Panther, Wakanda Forever and the problem with Hollywood - an African perspective What price is being paid to appeal to global audiences? Film-makers might focus so much on the western gaze that they lose focus on telling African stories authentically and respectfully. In my study, I analyse various films including the Ghanaian film Azali and the Nigerian movie Lionheart to argue that that's exactly what's happening. Dancing to the tune of the west Despite the existence of thriving African film and TV industries before the advent of streaming technologies, we are seeing a replication of what I call the everydayness of colonialism in the area of media representations of the continent. Here, African filmmakers and producers find themselves jumping through hoops to tell stories that are ""fit"" to be streamed to Netflix's millions of American, European and global subscribers. Global cosmopolitan audiences are prioritised over African audiences. Read more: Woman King is set in Benin but filmed in South Africa - in the process it erases real people's struggles African audiences at home and in the diaspora are the reason we have vibrant film industries such as Nollywood to begin with. This displacement of African audiences happens both in representation and in access. Most African movie audiences do not have access to Netflix and other streaming platforms due to the digital divide and the cost of subscribing. So the target audience shifts to the elite, both African and global, who can afford to stream. Azali and Lionheart Ghana and Nigeria's film industries were developed by artists who wanted to reflect their societies to their communities. I found that with Netflix's arrival, there is a danger of disrupting and undoing this important work. The intervention of US streamers has led to the development of glossier versions of Africa. They are universal enough to be consumed by anyone, anywhere in the world, even if it means sacrificing the integrity of stories to achieve this global appeal. In Azali, for example, I found that the film sacrificed authentic language and geographical accuracy to tell a story for a western audience. Azali explores the themes of child marriage, child-trafficking and rural-urban migration in Ghana. Here, a film about the Dagbamba was set in the town of Zebilla, where Dagbanli is not the dominant language. The film cast non-Dagbanli speakers in major roles to speak a language they neither understood nor had any proficiency in. If Dagbamba had been centred as the primary audience of the movie, this cultural indignity might not have happened. Lionheart, though star-studded, departed from traditional Nollywood narrative conventions. The film tells the story of a wealthy Nigerian family and the quest of a young woman to take control of the family business. The movie had high production values and told a story that would be considered universally relatable. However, it was disqualified in its bid for an Oscar nomination in the Best International Feature Film category because of its majority English dialogue. Despite appealing to Netflix in the area of production quality and storyline, African film-makers were still punished by the Academy. Nigeria and Ghana's film industries have traditionally told a wide variety of African stories. Netflix's arrival is reducing African stories to narratives about the elite and for the global cosmopolitan elite. Stories about the majority of Africans are being erased. Africa becomes a backdrop to tell stories about the elite class. In my study, I argue that narrative construction is an important part of identity and that when external factors begin to determine how African stories are told, it distorts the image of Africa for Africans and raises questions of cultural sovereignty. Moving forward It is refreshing to see African cultures appreciated on a global scale. But this shouldn't erase narratives about the African masses and working communities.

62AD55B1040D7DB490B8B1F8AD10A6C2,2025-06-27 07:16:25,en,PRINT,"  In tanned, tousled form, the actor stars in a Formula 1 story about fast cars, last chances and pretty people by the director of ''Top Gun: Maverick.'' Set in the world of Formula 1 racing, the easy, oh-so breezy ''F1: The Movie'' wants you to believe that it's about winning and losing, talent and teamwork and all the tough love and hard work that go into Grand Prix glory. That's the pitch, though there's both more and less at play. An enjoyably arranged collection of all the visual attractions and narrative clichés that money can buy, ''F1'' is very simply about the satisfactions of genre cinema and the pleasures of watching appealing characters navigate fast, exotic cars that whine like juiced-up mosquitoes. It's also about the pleasures of that ultrasmooth performance machine, Brad Pitt. At once calculated and almost touchingly sincere, the story is as formulaic as its title subject. Pitt plays Sonny Hayes, a driver who could've been, should've been, a world-class contender. Recruited for service by an old pal, Ruben (a silky Javier Bardem), Sonny gets one last proverbial chance to prove himself while facing the customary hurdles, including his past, a wary crew, a corporate tool and a hungry young rival. There are crackups, breakdowns, near-misses and some well-lit darkish nights (well, minutes) of the soul. Three women have decent speaking roles; all share at least one meaningful moment with Sonny. The whole sleek package is as hackneyed as it sounds, but when the cars and cameras zoom around the track, it scarcely matters. A great deal depends on your love of or maybe just tolerance for straightforward, ostentatious, professionally crafted spectacles that don't ask much of you but time and money. In return, you get nearly three hours of fizzy drama, some superficial peeks into a rarefied world and a studiously casual, tousled and tanned Pitt in classic Hollywood Zen master mode. Much like the movie itself, which is an enjoyable metaphor for the filmgoing experience, Pitt's star performance is nothing if not self-reflexive. To that end, the director Joseph Kosinski showcases Pitt like an old-studio attraction, bathing him in pretty light, putting him in signifying outfits -- think of a coyly grinning, blue-jeaned Robert Redford circa the 1970s -- and at times stripping off some of that clothing. Kosinski buffed Tom Cruise to a similar high gloss in ''Top Gun: Maverick.'' As in that movie, ''F1'' deploys its star for a classic setup between an individual and a community, one in which a loner-outsider rides in to deliver wisdom and near-mystical gifts. (The producers include Lewis Hamilton, a seven-time Formula 1 world champ, and Jerry Bruckheimer, who, with films like ''Top Gun,'' helped define modern American blockbuster cinema.) Written by Ehren Kruger, the veneer-thin story opens with Sonny at Daytona, where he awakes in his van next to the speedway, fires up Zeppelin's ''Whole Lotta Love'' and runs winning circles around the competition. Not long after, his former track rival, Bardem's Ruben, offers Sonny a chance to drive for a (fictional) losing Formula 1 team. Sonny takes it, sliding into an aerodynamic open-wheel ride amid some back story, character development, pro forma antagonism with a hotshot teammate, Joshua (Damson Idris), and a romance with the team's technical director, Kate (Kerry Condon), all elements that the filmmakers use like brick mortar to help build what is effectively a series of races into a cohesive whole. [Video:  Watch on YouTube.] It's no surprise given that the Formula 1 organization cooperated in the making of ''F1'' that there are no shocks or revelations about it or the controversies relating to its current leadership. Like other racing movies, including John Frankenheimer's ''Grand Prix'' (1966), and Ron Howard's ''Rush'' (2013), personalities drive this movie and sell the brand. And, also like those films -- and Michael Mann's 2024 biographical portrait ''Ferrari'' -- Kosinski amps up ''F1'' by trying to lessen the distance between you and the racers. He does that partly by integrating images of Formula 1 events, from the tracks to the crowded stands, with shots of Pitt and Idris doing their own driving in cars tricked out to look like the real deal. Much like Formula 1 does during its races, Kosinski and his team have tried to intensify the audience's experience by mounting multiple cameras onboard the cars, which together provide a collagelike display of different viewpoints, from inside the vehicles and out. The results look unsurprisingly brighter, glossier and significantly more artful than those captured by Formula 1 (it also uses itty-bitty helmet cams) and have been edited together for maximum dramatic tension and pow. As the camera angles change along with the gears, creating a rotation of close-ups and wider shots, you are, by turns, watching Sonny and Joshua watch the track, other drivers and each other, sharing their circuit of gazes. Every so often, as Sonny and Joshua zip around, visors down, you see their eyes in close-up, alternately narrowing and bugging, perhaps much like yours. As intended, these images help close the divide between you and the characters, and they amplify the movie's visceral effect, which you can feel down to your toes. Formula 1's attempt to put its fans in the driver's seat, or thereabouts, is a reminder of the cinematification of everyday life. For its part, ''F1'' is a reminder that sometimes, though maybe especially when you need a break from reality and its banal spectacles, some movies can still sweep you up and transport you to other far-out realms -- a foundational power that remains, no matter who's in the driver's seat.

mov_D439F307360A5D6A67B1E365B309D144,2025-06-27 11:10:32,en,WEB,"  In the rapidly evolving world of online marketing, TikTok has emerged as a groundbreaking platform upon which businesses are able to achieve unprecedented visibility through calculated appearances on highlights and viral videos. The content delivery mechanism on the platform through an algorithm opens avenues of opportunity for businesses to reach colossal numbers of individuals organically, revolutionizing traditional forms of advertising and setting new benchmarks for actual brand interaction. Entertainment and Sports Brands Take the Lead Sporting goods brands and media companies have been extremely good at using the virality of TikTok. Nike is seen often in fitness do-it-yourself makeover clips, dance challenges, and sports achievement series seamlessly integrating their brands into user-generated material without feeling too corporate. The gaming sector has also taken notice of this potential, with sites such as MelBet positioning themselves strategically in sporting material and game discussion to reach interested clients which engagement-only participate in sports betting and casino gaming. Disney's strategy paves the way for advanced content strategy, having their brand portrayed in film reaction videos, theme park engagement, and vintage content outside demographic niches. The triumph of the entertainment business is because of the understanding that TikTok favors real storytelling over traditional marketing methods. Such brands know that coercive product placements tend to fail primarily, while natural inclusion in engaging stories increases engagement and conversion rates way beyond traditional marketing methods. Overwhelming Organic Integration: Technological Giants Apple, Samsung, and other tech companies have mastered the art of making an appearance on TikTok videos without explicitly advertising their products. Their products appear in innovative videos, tutorials, and lifestyle videos that rack up millions of impressions through sheer product placement that never feels artificial. Game studios are another group finding resounding success on the platform. Epic Games, Riot Games, and mobile game studios are staples in gameplay clips, reaction videos, and community challenges. Those staples habitually earn more engagement than typical ad campaigns through their utilization of the genuine excitement of gaming communities. The key to success for the tech sector is understanding that users of TikTok are watching for entertainment first, and for advertising messages second. It's successful technology brands that focus on enabling creativity rather than pushing sales messages, and this translates into higher engagement rates and greater brand affinity with younger viewers. Fashion and Beauty Brands Sweeping Viral Content The beauty and fashion industries have witnessed unprecedented growth through TikTok features, with Rare Beauty, Fenty Beauty, and Glossier emerging as household brands due to mostly viral videos and consumer reviews. These brands have excelled at product exposure rather than virtual user experience. Some of the reasons behind fashion and beauty brand success on TikTok are: Transformation Content: Fashion style and makeup tips vlogs merely demonstrate products in a way that truly creates value for a viewer User-Generated Reviews: Real product reviews and “get ready with me” vlogs build trust and influence purchasing more than traditional advertising does Participation in Trends: Fashion brands that rapidly respond to emerging trends and challenges stay in the game and current in the platform's high-speed culture Influencer Collaborations: Strategic influencer partnerships involving macro and micro-influencers enable reach extension with preservation of authenticity The specific value of the beauty market on TikTok is the visual format of its content. Transformative videos, before-and-after, and tutorial content all lend themselves easily to demonstrations of products and thus offer strong incentives for viewers to watch and share branded content. These brands have also been beautifully in tune with trending sounds, hashtags, and cultural happenings, remaining current in content within the ever-changing world of TikTok. Food and Beverage Industry's Viral Recipe Revolution Quick-serve restaurants and beverage brands are finding recipe videos, hacks, and taste tests generating incredible action on TikTok. Starbucks, Chipotle, and other energy drink manufacturers continue to crop up in user-generated content, as consumers feature innovative ways of using the brands. The success in the food industry shows the strength of functional content that delivers value to consumers instantaneously. Recipe modifications, secret menus, and cooking tips become irresistible motivations for consumers to use brand content while, at the same time, driving traffic and revenue.

A Color Charm clear hair gloss (which *also* comes in various color-depositing options!) that's enriched with shea butter and works like a ~charm~ to add new richness and multi-dimensional shine to your locks. You'll come for the shine, but you'll stay for its alluring scent, which has notes of peach, jasmine, and sandalwood. Promising reviews: ""I have been dying my hair blonde since high school, and decided I want to go back to my natural color of dark brown. I used the bronze/copper color as filler and then dyed it with this color. It IS darker than it looks!! But it was just what I wanted, a deep brown. Your hair will be shiny and soft, too. I've bought and re-dyed twice (I do it every two-ish months) while I wait for my natural color to grow out, and I like it a lot."" —Alayna ""Great demi-permanent dye for those that don't want to continue damaging bleached hair, works great as a toner. Toned me to a nice ash blonde. Hair felt silky, conditioned, and healthier afterwards. I would definitely recommend this and buy this again."" —ma'iinganiwi Get the clear gloss from Amazon for $9.99 (available in 21 other colors). 2. A L'Oreal Paris Glossing Lamination Hair Mask formulated with glycolic acid to give your locks that ~glass-like shine~. This mask intensely smooths your hair fibers to look like they're basically...reflecting light?! It's also deliciously scented with bergamot and peony, which is just the cherry on top. After rinsing shampoo and conditioner, apply the mask on damp hair from lengths to tips. Leave on for five minutes, then rinse. Promising reviews: ""Liquid gold. I loveeee this product! It is so affordable and works like magic!!! It feels like I just got my hair done each time I use it! Such a self-esteem booster! It is so nice to do this for five minutes in the shower, and it just lifts your mood and makes you feel so much more put together once you are out of the shower! I highly recommend!"" —Annalisa Kampel ""I have 3C curly frizzy hair, and previous glossing treatments didn't do anything, so I didn't have high expectations. I was super surprised that my curls appeared glossier and were reflecting light after using this. It didn't do much for the frizz, but it's not meant to. It's also super easy to use!"" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $9.99. 3. Or a L'Oreal Paris Le Color toning hair gloss that'll boost shine as well as hit on any color-correcting you'd like to do — such as neutralizing brassiness, adding a cool tone to blonde hair, or enhancing warm, golden tones. Its coconut oil-infused, deep conditioning base will lock in some top-tier shine, all while giving it a fresh hint of color. Reviewers mention that it helps with maintenance between salon appointments, and helps them save some major $$. This in-shower toning gloss is easy to use — no mixing, no gloves, no hassle! Just leave it on for 15 minutes, then rinse. Promising review: ""I LOVE this stuff. I have cowboy copper hair, and red hair fades to this ugly golden orange color. And the shade isn't bad, it's that golden hue I can't stand 'til I redye it. This stuff! Tones it in one wash and instantly gets rid of the yellow and keeps it nice and copper-brown-red color. For $8, it lasts me about three weeks, and it smells incredible and leaves my hair silky soft...."
mov_B026BF8875B52F20B224888F57B5D3D6,2025-06-28 21:05:54,en,WEB,"  Pulp, Pyramid Stage ★★★★☆ It's the big reveal of Glastonbury's worst kept secret. Yes, Patchwork are the cult Britpop-ish band, Pulp. “Did you know we were gonna play?” asks a suited and booted Jarvis Cocker, full of his offbeat British charm. The completely packed out crowd whoops. “How?!” the frontman replies, miffed. Whether it's on their unofficial anthem of longing “Disco 2000”, with its rambunctious chorus, or equally lustful indie rock bop “Babies”, Pulp lean into the hits which go down like a cool lager on this warm evening. But it seems the crowd isn't only here for those. New single, “Got To Have Love” shines with the input of the gospel backing singers and its simple lyrics punched up on the screen for the punters (how many bands on a reunion sprint can say that about their fresh material?) . Cocker's charisma is palpable: he flops around the stage, in constant communication with the crowd, whether via dead-pan expressions or playful exchanges of chatter. It's inconceivable today but Cocker was nervous last time they played at Glastonbury, he says, adding, “But today I feel very relaxed.” The lively band are evidently buoyed by the hot reception of their critically successful UK No 1 album, More. Here Pulp prove the party doesn't have to end, as long as common people are around to join in. Brandi Carlile, Pyramid Stage ★★★☆☆ As the smooth riffs of evanescent ballad “Broken Horses” massage the senses of the hungover and overheated gatherers, it's clear Brandi Carlile was a solid choice for an early main stage slot. The country star is chirpy, curious about being here, reporting that she's always wanted to see what Glastonbury is all about, and her porch-sitting, liquor-swigging soft rock songs are totally inoffensive to the casual (and perhaps sunburned) listener. It's been a colourful few years for the Grammy award winning Americana songwriter. After forming the wonderful all-female supergroup of country artists, The Highwaywomen, around the turn of this decade, Carlile then partnered up with another LGBTQ star, Elton John, for their 2025 collaboration album, “My wife tried to warn me, she told me this was a magical. magical place,” Carlile says, choked up. “It's hard to fathom actually, so many peace loving people in one place.” If people know any of her songs, rousing alt-rock love song “The Story” would be it – violinists warble along gently as Carlile belts every word. What's missing is a crowd more familiar with her rich, earnest body of work, but as she plays the greatest hits for anyone in the know, she wins over some stragglers; it's a perfectly lovely start to Saturday. Not Completely Unknown, Acoustic Stage ★★★☆☆ Back in the real world you can go and see Bob Dylan to feel the great man's mumbling presence, but it's only in the idealistic dreamland of Glastonbury that you might hear a recognisable and coherent performance of his songs. Rumours that the Acoustic Stage presentation entitled Not Completely Unknown might feature Timothy Chalamet turn out to be mere distraction to lure crowds away from Kneecap – Andrew Garfield and Eddie Redmayne make an early exit when Timbo fails to show – but it does involve an array of notables telling their best Dylan stories and delivering their most heartfelt renditions from a catalogue which, historically, has often benefited from being shorn of Bob's sandpaper vocal. Sid Griffin of the Long Ryders fronts rich and resonant takes on “Ballad of Easy Rider” and Dylan-penned Byrds classic “You Ain't Goin' Nowhere”; Ralph McTell recreates Bob's finest harmonica lilts; Paul Carrack takes “Mr Tambourine Man” back to the porch swing and Katya reimagines “One More Cup of Coffee” in haunting trip-hop fashion. RAYE, Pyramid Stage ★★★★☆ The slot between the not-so-secret Pulp set and Neil Young is a tough one to fill, and Raye's first half hour gives us a lot to think about. Devastating songs about sexual assault have dozens in the crowd in tears. Raye's voice and presence are phenomenal but the music lessons and never-ending ballads of the first half of her set are a bit too Graham Norton – like a sanitised Amy Winehouse, to whom the comparisons are many and justified. The crowd's good will begins to wane before she thankfully pulls it back with her Jax Jones collab “You Don't Know Me”. The track gets everyone bobbing while “the nightclub section” of the evening keeps the energy up – “Prada” and its pyro alone has thousands ready for a night out at the South East Corner. But the real crest of the wave arrives with set closer “Escapism” – the perfect combination of euphoria and catharsis. Haim, Pyramid Stage ★★★☆☆ TBA fatigue? Has Glastonbury 2025 reached Peak Secret? Whatever, with half the festival across site reliving 1995 with “Patchwork” and the Gen XCX half already camped up at the Other Stage in fear of a Lorde/Kneecap style lockout, Haim hit the Park Stage to a busy but not overwhelmed field. And get busy not overwhelming it. “Wow, this is crazy!” Danielle Haim exclaims, surveying the crowd, but “polite” would be a better descriptor. Haim's fundamental oddity has always been that they come on like a kick-ass rock band but are actually more of a stroke-cheek soft rock act...."

No greeting, just that slow flick of his eyes down, then up. A pause at her mouth. Her skirt. Her eyes. He doesn't move until the car pulls away. Then it's the lean — shoulder brushing hers, thigh finding alignment. Dinner is casual. Familiar. Her glass stays mostly full. He watches her tongue against the rim. The rust red halter plays well with the low light — not attention-seeking, just difficult to ignore. He doesn't reach for her hand, but she notices his knee drift closer every time she shifts. They talk, laugh, drift through one course to another. She lets the silence between refills build just enough before breaking it. He holds her gaze longer than necessary each time. She props one elbow on the table, half-listening, half-watching him talk about something that's clearly meant to distract. He's good at that — peppering charm between stories, folding glances under compliments. She shifts in her seat. The pearls press just right. She crosses her legs and lets the rhythm settle. They clink faintly, once, against the seam of her thoughts. He doesn't notice. Yet... The bar comes next. Dimmer. Louder. A pool table tucked in the back, worn cues stacked in a corner rack. He calls stripes before the cue ball even moves. She perches on the stool nearby — one leg crossed, then uncrossed. Eyes low. Lips glossier now, just enough to make someone pause mid-sentence. “Your turn.” She doesn't move right away. Just watches him chalk the cue again. The veins on his forearm shift with the angle. Her gaze lingers. Then — she slides off the stool and leans over the table. One hand flat against the felt. The other steadying the cue. He moves behind her. Not close enough to touch. Close enough to notice. That the skirt lifts slightly when she bends. That the shrug slips lower across her shoulders. That she's warm — deliberately so. He breathes in like he wants to speak, but the words don't make it past his throat. She takes the shot. It misses...."

Establish the core thought and core identity (or even what that means in real life terms) 2. Make the brand aspirational to form a community 3. Make social media content in line to the core identity / thought 4. How to do branding elements in line to all this Like if you have made a brand, what *actual* work went into all of it? Like not just oh branding needs a strong story telling but like how is this story telling formed, how do you translate it across? I know the question is loaded so any solid inputs will be helpful."
mov_9EEE985075BE1F94DE2D39613144F621,2025-06-30 14:50:26,en,WEB,"  One of the things that brings me the most joy in summer as a plant parent is watching my houseplants thrive. New growth doubles them in size, while their glossy foliage soaks up sun, making up for any losses during the harsher seasons. But, only through trial and error have I been able to make the most of the warmest season for my houseplants, avoiding summer houseplant care mistakes. You see, indoor plant care requires effort all year round. So, while the summer provides much more favorable conditions for houseplants (unlike cold windows and lack of light when caring for houseplants in winter), there is still room for things to go wrong if you neglect care. More specifically, the hotter temperatures bring new challenges for houseplant hydration and protecting plants from scorch and active pest populations. But, don't fret. All you need to do is familiarize yourself with these five summer houseplant care mistakes to avoid. 5 summer houseplant care mistakes You'll find a lot of these summer houseplant care mistakes go back to the basics of common indoor plant mistakes. However, it's important to understand how the warmest season specifically impacts houseplant health and what you need to do to ensure they make it through to fall. 1. Keeping sensitive plants on a south-facing windowsill The first thing I always tell new houseplant collectors is that not every plant grows in the same conditions. This is especially true when it comes to indoor low light plants vs indoor plants for direct sun. The former won't do well in a direct sun position. In fact, such intense sunlight exposure can cause leaf scorch and discoloring foliage. 'More light does indeed come through south-facing windows compared to others, so there's a high chance that on sunny days, delicate plant leaves may get sunburned,' says Anastasia Borisevich of Plantum. 'If the plants are not succulents, cacti, or variegated varieties that benefit from sunlight to maintain their coloration, it's better to choose an east or west-facing window, where the amount of direct bright light is limited to four to six hours.' If you're struggling to find a less intense sunlight spot in your home, try creating filtered light with these sheer curtains from Wayfair. 2. Not increasing watering frequency Watering houseplants is where a lot of indoor gardeners go wrong, as too little or too much water can quickly lead to the downfall of houseplants. A factor that impacts watering frequency: temperature. So, as summer days warm up the temperature, it's important to adjust watering frequency accordingly. 'In summer, the soil in pots dries out faster, so plants need to be watered more frequently than usual. It's very important that watering is thorough and regular, but the surface of the soil has time to dry out between waterings,' says Anastasia. Of course, each houseplant has differing watering needs and some will be able to deal with drought better than others. Nevertheless, they will all dry out more quickly in summer, so it's likely you'll need to water more often than in other seasons. Dehydration can cause a few symptoms, for example a monstera drooping or an asparagus fern turning yellow. To avoid this, I like to use this soil moisture meter from Amazon to monitor moisture levels in my houseplant soil. Depending on the plant, I tend to top up water when the top couple of inches have dried out. 3. Watering too often Just like underwatering, overwatering is also something to avoid in summer. I've been guilty of this in previous years, worrying about the hot weather dehydrating my houseplants and rushing to pick up my watering can to add more water to the soil. But, if you don't allow houseplant soil to dry sufficiently before watering again, it could waterlog the soil and cause houseplant root rot. Not only this, but too-wet soil can cause problems like a fungus gnat infestation or a build-up of mold and mildew. 'Many assume more sun equals more water, but the real key is checking the soil, not the schedule. When it's hot, soil can dry quickly on the surface while still holding moisture deeper down,' says Donna Letier, houseplant expert and CEO of Gardenuity. ' Always test with your finger or a moisture meter,' she adds. Donna also says to avoid using cold water in the heat: 'Room temperature water is easier on stressed roots. Plus, whenever possible remember to hydrate from the bottom up,' she says. Make sure you're equipped with a houseplant watering can (from Amazon) for the summer season ahead. 4. Overfertilizing houseplants Fertilizing mistakes are also common during summer. This is because spring and summer are the ideal time to feed houseplants (because they're actively growing), but feeding too much could kill off indoor plants by burning roots. 'When a plant is stressed from high temps, it's not focused on growth. Instead of monthly feeding, cut back to a diluted mix every six weeks,' says Donna. ' Skip the fertilizer entirely if your plant is showing signs of sunburn or root stress,' she adds...."
mov_FB1D7ECEBFF88D659FEA70A13ED68A49,2025-06-30 15:00:56,en,WEB,"  Perfume is meant to be worn year-round. But in heat of summer, it's a good idea to lighten up with everything and that includes fragrance. That might explain why hair and body mists, a lighter alternative to perfume, are exploding right now. “I find hair and body mists to be super versatile, they're fresh, light and easy to use,” says Chriselle Lim, Co-Owner and Creative Director of PHLUR. “They're the perfect way to add fragrance to your day without feeling too heavy or formal, and they're great for layering. There's also something playful and approachable about them. It's a little luxury that feels accessible, and I think that really resonates with people right now and reflects a broader shift towards embracing elevation and self-expression in our beauty routines.” No stranger to the trend, PHLUR has expanded their presence in the category. “Launching body mists felt like a natural next step for PHLUR as we're always thinking about ways to make fragrance more approachable and expanding the ways you can bring fragrance into different parts of your day,” Lim says. “With body mists, we wanted to give people more ways to express themselves through fragrance. Body mists are a lighter, more effortless way to enjoy scent, while still delivering the quality and complexity our customers expect from PHLUR. I personally love layering our body mists with our eau de parfums. I use the eau de parfum as a base on my pulse points and then apply the mist to my hair and clothes for a subtle, fresh layer. My favorite combo right now is PHLUR Beach Skin Hair & Body Mist and Missing Person Eau de Parfum.” So what exactly makes hair and body mists unique from perfumes? “The main difference is in the fragrance concentration,” Lim says. “Body mists are meant to be more subtle and light, and so carry a lower concentration of fragrance oil than eau de parfums. With our PHLUR Body Mists though, we actually formulate with a much higher fragrance load than is typical for body mists—it was important for us that our body mists have a stronger projection and last longer, so customers still get that bold, unexpected PHLUR scent experience.” Start spritzing with these top new hair and body mists. Phlur Peach Skin Hair & Body Fragrance Mist Imagine sipping a fresh, juicy mimosa al fresco while basking in the sun and you have this soft, sweet (but not too sweet), velvety scent. “We hadn't formulated a fruity gourmand in over a year, and I was craving a scent that captured a summer feeling but with a juicy, fruity twist,” Lim says. “I love that Peach Skin isn't a straightforward peach—it is fresh, juicy, velvety, like biting into a ripe peach, but it is layered with beautiful florals and a woody, creamy base that elevates the fragrance. I love to take a twist on nostalgic fragrances, and I feel like it's hard to get a peach scent that doesn't feel too juvenile. We worked tirelessly on Peach Skin and am so proud of what we created. It's sophisticated, yet flirty and entirely addictive.” Notes of peach are rounded out with plum, amber, bergamot, jasmine, vanilla orchid, milky sandalwood and coconut caramel. $38, phlur.com Josie Maran Bohemian Fig Fragrance Mist When clean beauty queen Josie Maran relaunched her brand last year to be more eco-friendly, she did so with new fragrances inspired by growing up in California. Now all four scents are available in fragrance mist format, made with 100% natural ingredients and designed to be super hydrating with argan oil and jojoba. Bohemian Fig feels like a night out in a tropical town with fig, vetiver and vanilla orchid. Layer them with her body products or wear them solo. $26, sephora.com Dior Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet Hair Mist When you really want to give your scent staying power, apply both a perfume and a mist. In this case, opt for the classic Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet Hair Mist, an alcohol-free hair perfume infused with rosewater to scent your locks in the gorgeous floral. After applying the eau de toilette to skin, spritz on the hair mist for a lasting trail. $82, dior.com Nest Santa Barbara Strawberry The sensation of warm summer afternoons is evoked with every spritz of this light and luminous body spray. To balance the scent of Santa Barbara strawberries, the fruity floral adds pink peony and solar woods.

n0lutyr,2025-06-30 16:59:34,en,REDDIT,"  Honestly I bought some glossier products back in 2020 and while I liked them I haven't purchased anything since. I don't really like wearing makeup. I don't like being able to feel products on my face and I wear makeup so rarely it makes me self conscious when I do wear it that I'll have applied it poorly and look silly. So the lightweight, subtle, and buildable nature of a lot of their products was very appealing to me. There's been a few times I've looked into replacing my products but found things about reformulations and stuff that scared me off. It's annoying because I really want new makeup to wear on the odd occasion. All of mine is definiviely far too old now. But I have no idea what's worth repurchasing these days vs what has since been done better by other brands. When I look at glossier now it seems more oriented towards perfumes which makes makes me dubious of their other products. Especially when combined with my very vague understanding that some have been reformulated unfavorably."

I placed my hands on either side of her hips, grabbing the cold railing with everything I had, desperate to be close to her. Then I leaned into her slightly. “He's just an idiot who's upset he lost the best thing he's ever had. Nothing in the world could make me want to 'return' you.

It slowly absorbs into the lips, so it's not as occlusive as it seems it will be. It's not a favorite. It doesn't last longer than 3-4 hours, so it doesn't last through the night on me. It's also pretty messy. The little handle to lift off the white seal is so small that it's hard to grab.

I only used the 2nd pic The image shows what appears to be droppings and chewed wood or insulation debris inside a cabinet or piece of furniture. The black, pellet-like droppings suggest the possible presence of rodents (likely mice) or insects such as cockroaches. Possible Issues: •Rodent Activity (Most Likely): •Droppings resemble mouse feces—small, black, and pellet-shaped. •Gnaw marks on wood and scattered debris are consistent with rodent nesting/feeding behavior. •Other Possible Pests: •Large cockroach infestations can also leave similar droppings, though usually glossier and with ridged ends. Actions You Should Take: 1. Clean & Disinfect Area: Wear gloves and a mask, and use a disinfectant. 2. Inspect Nearby Areas: Look for food sources, nesting materials, and entry points. 3. Seal Entry Points: Use steel wool or caulk for cracks and gaps. 4. Set Traps: Snap traps or bait stations can confirm if rodents are present. 5. Consider Pest Control: If infestation seems large or persistent. Would you like help identifying safe cleaning methods or trapping recommendations?"

It's literally hands down the best under makeup. I also sometimes the day I'm wearing makeup, do the naturium bha toner, after cleansing, once skin is dry, to get rid of any dead skin. . that's another great prep step before makeup, and then I wait for that to dry, and follow with the soothing milky toner + moisturizer. Also, the moisturizer does include vitamin c, so you really don't need to add a vit c serum. I also shave my face, wherever the peach fuz is with disposable sensitive razors that I get in a big pack cheap on amazon, like every 3-4 weeks & that does WONDERS. Hope all of this helps!!"

A tinted lip balm that's eerily close to the same magic as ""Black Honey,"" TikTok's beloved $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique, that it will genuinely startle you — especially when you see the price. This is a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lippie that's just a step above the ""no makeup makeup"" look, giving the perfect subtly polished effect. I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference! Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (also available in the pink honey version, and in a two-pack that mixes both!) . 2. Gold Bond's firming neck and chest cream your skin will be SO happy to soak up — this is formulated with aloe, salicylic acid, and jojoba oil to help hydrate, tighten, and gently exfoliate your skin so effectively that you should be able to see early results in two weeks. (For some reviewers, it only took a few days!) Promising review: ""I am a lotion user every single day. I use face moisturizers that I love. I am over the moon how good this is. I mainly use it on my neck, hands and forearms. The difference is amazing. My skin actually feels so good. I wish I could but larger containers of it."" —Kimberly P. Get it from Amazon for $11.19. 3. A travel-friendly SPF 50 Airy Sunstick Smoothing Bar, a K-beauty staple with a curved balm stick style that makes it super easy to apply, and a nonsticky, white cast–free formula that plays ABSURDLY well with makeup. If you're looking for a lightweight ""soft matte"" sunscreen to protect your skin, this is your new BFF. Check out a TikTok of the Airy Sunstick Smoothing Bar in action. Note that the AAD recommends using at least SPF 30 and reapplying as needed for skin protection. You can read about sunscreen myths and facts from dermatologists for more information! Promising review: ""NO WHITE CAST! I've been looking for a stick sunscreen and this was just exactly what was needed!! I'm a medium-toned Black woman and looking for something without a white cast is always a challenge. I have applied it on my bare skin and there isn't a white cast at all! It's a 'soft matte' finish, for sure, and looks like natural skin. Like you're not wearing anything at all."" —Martina Get it from Amazon for $17.02. 4.

A delightfully affordable instant foot peeling spray for anyone ready to go full YEEHAW!! on a pedicure, without the big salon price tag. This not only helps gently remove dead skin, but moisturizes dry and cracked heels, so you'll really get some refreshing bang for your buck. Promising review: ""This product delivers exactly as promised and is incredibly easy to use. I suffer from dry skin and often apply various products to soften my feet. With this, I simply spray it on and immediately massage it in with my hands. The dead skin comes off effortlessly. There's no waiting time, and it's gentle on the skin. It leaves my feet feeling exceptionally soft. This has quickly become my new favorite thing."" —KimT Promising review: ""Wow, does this work amazingly!

1ls7lxs,2025-07-05 11:21:15,en,REDDIT,"  I want to share a fragrance grieveance story of mine. I absolutely adore Cherry Ambition by The 7 Virtues. Looove the opening of this dark boozy but still juicy cherry and on paper I also really like the drydown. It reminds me of Angel's Share but for some reason spicy fragrances with a lot of notes go super dusty and powdery and overwhelming on my skin 🥲🥲 same thing happens with Angel's share where the drydown just smells like an oberwhelming powdery mess on me. I wore Cherry Ambition again yesterday and unfortunately after an hour, it just smells like I'm putting my nose into a dusty old makeup bag which I hate. So I think I'll have to sell it and it makes me really sad cause I love everything about The 7 Virtues and own many of their fragrances (Santal Vanille is my signature scent and I also have Amber Vanilla, Coconut Sun & Vetiver Elemi). So now I'm looking into cherry perfumes that can replace it and don't turn so powdery & dusty on me. I'd love a juicy or creamy cherry or even musky. Currently on my list to try: Clean Reserve Whipped Cherry, Kayali Lovefest Burning Cherry, Dolce & Gabbana Q, Sabrina Carpenter Cherry Baby - would love to hear your thoughts on those fragrances and if any of you have a similar problem with perfumes turning overwhelmingly powdery on skin. It happens a lot to me with florals too (apart from jasmine for some reason) For example even Glossier You Fleur turned extremely powdery and vintage smelling on me"

Content note: This book contains discussions of anxiety, depression, and panic attacks. Goodreads / Amazon ~Excerpt~ As soon as the doors closed, I turned to her. “Luna,” I breathed. I didn't knowwhat to do, but I was being drawn to her, the tether from earlier pulling at me even harder. I placed my hands on either side of her hips, grabbing the cold railing with everything I had, desperate to be close to her. Then I leaned into her slightly. “He's just an idiot who's upset he lost the best thing he's ever had. Nothing in the world could make me want to 'return 'you. If you were mine, I'd do anything to keep you.” Her eyes became even glossier as they drifted up to meet mine. “You don't even know what it is.” She looked away. “I didn't think I needed to tell you since this is all . . .” “This is all what?” I asked her more pointedly. Her lips parted, but she said nothing. I could see the ghost of the word 'fake 'on them. I gripped the railing tighter. “I never wanted any of this to be pretend. Not one second of it has been for me. Has it been for you?” She shook her head methodically, as if knowing what she was unleashing, and my lips curved upward at her response. Especially when her body gravitated toward mine like she couldn't stand to be apart. I started to remove my glasses, knowing this was the first time my feelings and intentions would be on full display for her. The first time, nothing would be covered up under the guise of Louis 'plan. “Luna, why did you write One More Hour? Was what you said on stage true?” I asked with urgency. But her face said it all. I didn't need the words her lips mouthed so sensually . . .“Yes . . . It was you I wanted. I've always wanted you. I still do.” As I went to pull off my glasses, she stopped me, shaking her head emphatically. I felt like a dork, with the goofiest grin on display. “What? You want me to keep them on? I was trying to look less like a nerd.”..."

1ltmnzl,2025-07-07 06:06:15,en,REDDIT,"  User generated content is basically any content that is created by the consumer, customer, or user of a product, service, or a business. It differs in the fact that it is not sponsored by the brand nor do the creators have any monetary gains to make from the content they have produced. And a lot of brands are now leveraging these user generated content pieces in their individual marketing efforts. This could be because UGC is known to be 20% more influential than any other type of media when it comes to driving Millennial's purchasing decisions. In this blog we are going to quickly look at some leading brands that are using user generated content and winning the marketing game. And learn from their tactics to implement in our own initiatives and efforts. **Why UGC Matters: The Power of Customer-Generated Content** Did you know that content created by real people greatly sways purchasing choices across age groups? Over 79% of individuals are influenced by it and 93% find it extremely helpful! That is a massive number. And not one that must be ignored if you want to make use of the content your users and audience have created for you. But that is not all. User generated content isn't just more trustworthy, it is a lot helpful for boosting SEO factors as well. Because UGC tends to unknowingly incorporate long tail keywords, specific facts and figures, and candid content that search engines like Google favour for being unbiased and human written content. With that being said we hope you are ready to dive into some great examples of user generated content across different brands. Let us check them out. **10 Best User-Generated Content Examples in Action** **A. Social Media UGC** * **GoPro** - Their entire social media strategy revolves around featuring stunning videos and pictures taken by clients using their cameras. The “Photo Of The Day”, along with other hashtag competitions, motivates clients to post GoPro content on social media. * **Apple's “Shot On iPhone”** - Campaigns shot with the phone by regular iphone users are put on a billboard around the globe and on social media for everyone to see. Showcases the camera features available in their devices. * **Starbucks' “White Cup Contest”** - Guests were allowed to personalize the plain white Starbucks cups and post pictures of them on social media. The winning design was turned into a limited edition reusable cup. * **Airbnb Instagram strategy** - They have ever featured pictures taken by the hosts and the guests at actual Airbnb properties, which show real life rather than promotional materials to market the brand. * **Coca-Cola “Share a Coke” campaign** - By customizing their bottles with names and asking people to post a picture whenever they come across a bottle with their name, Coca-Cola sparked millions of social media posts. * **Adobe #Adobe_Perspective** - The Software Company uses hashtag posts to show off art made using their products. They also feature the user generated content on the company's page and social media. * **Lululemon #thesweatlife** - The athletic apparel brand encourages customers to take pictures of themselves doing various activities while clad in Lululemon clothing and post them on social media. * **“Crash the Super Bowl” by Doritos -** Super Bowl aired commercials made by fans, enabling them to win and have them aired. For quite a while do-it-yourself commercials were broadcast by Doritos, extending prize-winning opportunities in the form of fans turned superbowl winners. * **Hashtag AsSeenOnMe by ASOS. ** Customers are entitled to post pictures showcasing their outfits, tagging the fashion retailer. The snapshots are displayed on their corporate website and social media platforms, providing them with a requisitioned feed of genuine buyers. * **Glossier**. True clients of the beauty brand are made the center of attention always in their ads placed on social media, which is their entire marketing strategy, and so is leveraging user paid pictures and ratings to make their brand gain pieces of color in the beauty world. **Collecting More Customer Reviews to Improve SEO** **B. Customer Review & Testimonial UGC** 1. **Amazon** -The infrastructure of Amazon is built around it's own verified customer ratings and reviews that are globally recognized.

1ltucwo,2025-07-07 13:36:24,en,REDDIT,"  This photo is Glossier concealer in very light 3 with yellow undertones. It is an amazing match for me. I've learned that yellow foundation does not automatically equal warm, and Chat GPT says this swatch would be a slightly muted, soft yellow that is neutral to cool and lacks peachy/orange-y warmth. Does this seem correct that my undertone would be yellow, but either neutral or cool rather than warm?"

18034035692673987,2025-07-07 15:04:50,en,INSTAGRAM,"  #MusicMonday Today I'm covering Neo Soul and this track is by one of my favourite artists Jill Scott ❤️❤️❤ Why is it called Neo Soul? Because it's not just soul — it's soul, reborn. ""Neo"" means new — but not in a way that forgets the past. Neo Soul carries Marvin's protest, Aretha's fire, Donny's ache, and wraps it in lo-fi beats, poetry, incense, and intention. It rose in the '90s when R&B got glossier, faster — and some of us craved slowness. Depth. Groove. Truth. So artists like D'Angelo, Erykah Badu, Maxwell, Lauryn Hill, and Jill Scott reached back — to vinyl, to jazz, to gospel — and breathed it forward. Neo Soul is a bridge. Between roots and now. Between body and spirit. Between vulnerability and rhythm. It's called Neo Soul because it remembers, but it also remakes. A new kind of soul — for a new kind of listener. Still sacred. Still slow. Still soaked in truth. #redhead #🇯🇲 #🇨🇮 #🇬🇧 #fashion #photoshoot #aigirl  #aimodel #aibeauty  #travelvibes #ginger #bikini #swimsuitmodel #fashionmodel #gingermodel #freckles #casual  #Ai_generated  #aiart #aiartoftheday #reggae #NeoSoul #NewSoulOldRoots #WhyItMatters #SoairseSounds #LeilaExplains #Eryk"

mov_D1E5439F0AC53A000E8AF97E7AA68143,2025-07-08 12:36:26,en,WEB,"  I've spent years battling flat, lifeless hair - no matter how many styling products I tried, my freshly volumised look would inevitably fall flat within 30 minutes. I'd pretty much accepted that unless I was heading to a hairdresser, my dreams of fully, bouncy hair were doomed. That was until I tried Philip Kingsley's Body Building collection. I'd heard good things, but after using the products consistently for a couple of weeks, they truly transformed my locks, making them look and feel fuller, glossier, and healthier. The good news is the Body Building set, which includes travel sizes of shampoo, conditioner, root-boosting spray, and plumping cream, is currently reduced to £19.50 from £25 for Amazon Prime Day. It's the perfect chance to try the range without committing to the full-size price tag, especially for those cautious about spending money on products that mightn't work for them. Plus, a wider selection of Philip Kingsley products are also discounted for Prime Day. That includes the full-sized Body Building Shampoo and Conditioner (£37.50 from £49), making it a good time to try the range or stock up on favourites. Philip Kingsley Body-Building Volumizing Collection Shop the sale The haircare set includes the Body Building Shampoo (75ml), Body Building Conditioner (75ml), Maximiser Root Boosting Spray (60ml), and Maximiser Strand Plumping Cream (20ml). £19.50 Amazon Of course, Philip Kingsley isn't the only brand offering volumising solutions. Living Proof's Full Shampoo and Conditioner (£52, Cult Beauty) are cult favourites for a reason, promising weightless volume and softness without build-up. Otherwise, Color Wow's Raise the Root Spray (£16.13, Look Fantastic) is another bestseller, adding serious lift without making hair feel sticky or stiff. Plus, it's also a favourite among celebrity stylists (Kim Kardashian's hairdresser is reportedly a fan). Back to Philip Kingsley, the first thing I noticed was its sleek packaging and scent - it looks like something you'd find in a luxury salon, and the products smell fresh and clean without being overpowering. The shampoo and conditioner left my hair feeling soft and nourished, although it wasn't until I added the Root Boosting Spray and Strand Boosting Cream that I saw the real transformation. The spray gave my roots a lightweight lift that lasted, with no crisp or crunchy texture - just natural bounce. And while the plumping cream required some trial and error (use a small amount unless you want sticky strands), it made styling significantly easier. My usual hot brush routine actually held its shape for hours - a first for me. Amazon Prime Signup Free Amazon Prime membership Fancy free takeaway delivery? Access to Deliveroo Plus is one of a host of advantages of Amazon Prime membership, including exclusive Prime Day discounts and perks on Hello Fresh, music, books and Prime Video. Usually £8.99 a month, you can now get a 30-day free trial to get access to the latest deals. Free Amazon After two weeks of regular use, I looked back at some older photos and was genuinely surprised at the difference. My hair looked shinier, fuller and healthier (see feature image). And while the full-size products are a bit of an investment (the shampoo alone retails for £45 on Philip Kingsley's website), the results make it worth it. Trust me - if you're on the fence, this travel set is the ideal entry point."

1luo2wl,2025-07-08 13:06:34,en,REDDIT,"  I asked an AI (Google Gemini) to create a Michelin level soup that combines the ABC Soup with the Sweet Corn soup and it gave me the recipe below which it named as Golden Harvest Consommé with Silken Corn Pearls & Umami Essence. I find it quite interesting and wonder what your thoughts are? Ah, a most intriguing challenge! To take two humble, yet beloved, Malaysian Chinese staples and elevate them into a symphony of flavors worthy of a Michelin star, while maintaining their comforting essence. This is not merely a combination; it is a re-imagination, a culinary alchemy. As a Cordon Bleu chef, I envision a soup that marries the rustic wholesomeness of the ABC soup with the silken sweetness of creamed corn, all while introducing refined textures and aromatic layers. My invention shall be called: ## **The Golden Harvest Consommé with Silken Corn Pearls & Umami Essence** This is not a thick, hearty soup, but rather a sophisticated, multi-layered experience. We'll extract the soul of the ingredients, refine them, and present them in a harmonious ballet of taste and texture. **Concept:** A crystal-clear, deeply flavorful consommé derived from the ABC soup ingredients, infused with subtle sweetness and richness from fresh corn, and finished with delicate, pearl-like corn textures and a nuanced umami depth. **Yields:** 6 servings **Prep time:** 45 minutes **Cook time:** 3 hours (plus overnight chilling for consommé) ### **Ingredients:** **For the Golden Harvest Consommé:** * 1 kg free-range chicken bones (back, wings, feet – for collagen) * 500g pork neck bones (for richness and sweetness) * 2 large organic carrots, peeled and roughly chopped * 2 medium organic potatoes, peeled and roughly chopped * 1 large Spanish onion, quartered * 2 ripe vine-ripened tomatoes, quartered * 1 ear of fresh sweet corn, kernels removed, cob reserved * 2-3 slices fresh ginger * 2.5 liters filtered water * 1 tsp sea salt (or to taste) * 1/2 tsp white peppercorns * 1 bay leaf **For the Silken Corn Pearls & Umami Essence:** * 2 ears of fresh sweet corn, kernels removed (approximately 2 cups) * 100ml high-quality chicken stock (from the consommé, if desired) * 50ml full-cream milk (organic preferred) * 1 tbsp unsalted butter, cold * 1/4 tsp white pepper * Pinch of sea salt * 1 tsp white truffle oil (optional, for an extra layer of luxury) * 2-3 sprigs fresh chervil or microgreens, for garnish **For the Umami Garnishes (optional but highly recommended for depth):** * 20g dried shiitake mushrooms, rehydrated and finely diced * 1 tbsp rendered Iberico ham fat (or high-quality bacon fat), finely diced for crisping * Small handful of finely chopped spring onion greens (for freshness) ### **Method:** **Part 1: The Golden Harvest Consommé (The Soul of the Soup)** 1. **Blanch the Bones:** In a large stockpot, place the chicken and pork bones. Cover with cold water and bring to a rolling boil. Boil for 5 minutes, skimming any scum that rises to the surface. Drain the bones, rinse them thoroughly under cold water, and clean any remaining impurities. This step is crucial for a clear consommé. 2...."

mov_C0CF534DF6465BFA525F27FE361F2C63,2025-07-08 16:26:01,en,WEB,"  Thomas Unger has made the unconventional choice to paint with coffee and motor oil. Courtesy Thomas Unger Like a lot of people, Thomas Unger is pretty particular about his coffee. How it tastes is important, but the Houston artist's principal interest is how it works as a painting medium. “I use brewed coffee sometimes, but mostly instant coffee,” he told Observer, mixing it with water until it reaches the right consistency for him to paint with. Darker grounds produce deeper and glossier browns, while a somewhat more watery slurry generates tans. Then, he starts painting on either thick watercolor paper or canvas that has been primed with motor oil. Again, he is pretty particular about the oil, preferring Pennzoil. “I use a mixture of used oil—carbon deposits make it darker, new oil and graphite powder,” he said. Unger doesn't go into why an artist might use coffee grounds and motor oil when watercolor paints and commercial primers already do the job satisfactorily, but perhaps the fact that his artistic sideline—he's a lieutenant in the U.S. Coast Guard—is called “CarsinCoffee” is reason enough. He is part of a small but notable group of artists who create works using nontraditional materials or use traditional mediums in nontraditional ways. Creatively stepping away from tried-and-true materials and techniques can result in unique output but may also create what art conservators call “inherent vices”—a flaw or defect that will cause an artwork to deteriorate. Unger asserted that his painting surfaces are stable and do not smell of oil, although some have a “pleasant” coffee aroma. Sometimes unconventional mediums just work. Artist Kiki Smith told Observer she “once had blood removed from my veins with a syringe and made drawings with it. I don't think there have been any conservation issues.” That's not always the case, however, and art conservators face challenges of all types. Ellen Moody, conservator of contemporary art at the Getty Conservation Institute in California, told Observer that she has worked on pieces made from chocolate (Dieter Roth), hair gel (Anicka Yi), milk and ketchup (Pope.L), epoxy and dried corn (Fernando Mastrangelo) and even a living beehive (Pierre Huyghe). SEE ALSO: Angelo Sotira Wants to Set the Standard for Displaying Code-Based Art Jackson Pollock used paint on canvas, but he used industrial paints such as house paint and automotive lacquers rather than more traditional artists' paints. “These paints were never designed for flexible supports and can become brittle and flake over time,” Moody explained. Her first job, after determining what she is dealing with, is to “stabilize the surface by introducing a suitable adhesive beneath partially detached areas, often using a syringe, then gently re-adhering and securing the flakes. We then tone the losses with materials that are stable, reversible and distinguishable under examination methods such as U.V. light.” It's not all bad news. She added that “many artworks using unconventional materials have aged surprisingly well. David Hammons' 1970s works incorporating grease, hair and chicken bones are a great example—they remain in good condition, likely due to careful construction and stable environments.” But not every experimental artist is as fortunate. In the late 1970s, Andy Warhol created a series of what he called “Oxidation Paintings” that involved studio assistants urinating and ejaculating on canvases prepared with copper-based metallic paints, which caused a chemical reaction resulting in abstract images of different colors. Urine, which is somewhat acidic, contributed to the oxidation and patina but did not eat through the canvas. “From my experience, if kept in the right environment, they are quite stable, but any high humidity can cause irreversible changes,” Suzanne Siano, a conservator in New York City, told Observer, adding that “the dried pee liquifies and runs down the work.” Urine also smells, but in the intervening years any odor has largely gone away. “A few piss paintings that were left after Warhol died that the foundation had me treat did smell of pee because they were stored in a drawer for many years, but I suspect that the smell has dissipated now that they are out in the air.” While the “piss paintings” (as they are often called) are in several major public collections, including the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney, the Tate in London and the Andy Warhol Museum in Pittsburgh, those that used semen as a material (the “cum paintings”) are all stored at the Warhol Museum and generally are not on view. More recently, artist Dan Colen has produced numerous paintings that use, instead of paint, flowers, Hubba Bubba bubble gum, bird poop, tar and feathers. Siano, who has worked on many of Colen's artworks, told Observer that one of the first issues she dealt with was building stronger stretchers since the material on these canvases was far too heavy for the supports to hold. The chewing gum created separate problems, as pieces began oozing color and just falling off. The long-term prospects for these paintings were not part of his thinking, and Colen side-stepped the conservation issues of his work, noting that “my paintings are about the things they are made of.” Damien Hirst with one of his formaldehyde sharks at White Cube in London in 2007. CHRIS YOUNG/AFP via In 1991, British artist Damien Hirst acquired a preserved tiger shark that he submerged in a glass tank of water and formaldehyde, titling it The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living. The level of formaldehyde in the tank was not sufficient, and within a dozen years, the shark began to deteriorate and the water became murky, requiring the artist to replace the shark with another and to submerge it in a solution with a higher formaldehyde content. (As to whether it's still the same artwork, Hirst called the question “a big dilemma.”) Sometimes, artists just have to throw up their hands and consign an artwork to the trash bin. Painter Tom Christopher once used “roofing tar on a piece as a background. It eventually hardened, and chunks fell off.” He let the buyer pick a work from his inventory as a replacement. Norwegian painter Odd Nerdrum had to do the same when an unconventional medium from one of his paintings detached from the canvas. A redo is rare in the art field, however. More often, artists do the best they can. British artist Chris Ofili applied some concoction to the elephant dung pedestals used to hold up some of his paintings to eliminate the smell, but still, those “pedestals were breaking apart and needed to be stabilized,” Kelly O'Neill, an art conservator in New York City, told Observer...."

mov_C385BD44FF25FF28A9B61E0D81B2612F,2025-07-10 06:34:58,en,WEB,"  At first glance, the numbers look super solid. The latest MST Marquee retail summary shows that online retail is still growing and up 8.1 per cent, year on year, overall, with online food surging by 14.4 per cent and non-food rising by 5.3 per cent. Over A$4.3 billion moved through Australian digital checkouts in May 2025 alone. An amazing story at first glance, and these are the kind of stats that normally signal great health and ongoing momentum, digital stability and operational confidence. But if you zoom out just slightly, not on the numbers, but on the shape of the trend, we start to see something else. The growth curve is flattening and has been since mid-2023. Not falling. Not failing. Just plateauing quietly and steadily. We can confidently say this isn't a logistics problem, and that it's not a tech constraint. It's certainly not consumer fatigue with digital convenience. What we're seeing is something more human, deeper and way more strategic. We've almost hit the emotional ceiling of online retail. We trust online now, job done but in turn we don't feel anything about it. The explosion of e-commerce over the past 10 years was fundamentally built on the back of three simple things: convenience, speed and access. It delivered exactly what it promised (most of the time): fast transactions, low friction and a product on your doorstep. That's amazing, right? Today, the promise has been met. The infrastructure is there. Logistics are predictable, and consumers trust the process. But what's not being recognised is that trust has quietly shifted into indifference. There's no magic left in a 'delivered' notification. No spark of emotion in the checkout journey. No wonder or assisted discovery in the scroll. In fact, we're seeing a version of what I'd call the Uber Effect, which is that moment when a once-amazing innovation becomes background noise. Invisible. Assumed and expected. There goes the surprise and delight. And why is this a problem? Because people don't fall in love with what they trust. They fall in love with what moves them. What excites, surprises or grounds them. Function alone doesn't build any memories. Emotion does. For some time, we thought personalisation was going to be the answer. But it's more than that if we think further ahead. What we need is presence. In response to stagnation, many brands have doubled down on personalisation, which is great, and I'm definitely not knocking that approach. We have behavioural tracking, AI-based recommendations and dynamic content served by data. All of it aimed at relevance. But relevance without soul is just noise that fits. Consumers are craving more than just being understood by the algorithm; they want to be acknowledged. To be met. To feel like a brand is genuinely present in their moment and not just watching their clicks. This is going to be the next evolution of digital experience: presence over personalisation. Presence is about emotional timing. It's the right word at the right moment. The brand that seems to know what mood I'm in and not just what product I'm likely to buy. It's not the offer that is going to convert, but the energy that connects. And energy is the one thing missing from most digital storefronts...."
mov_7FE93565C69463F9982026C220C618F9,2025-07-10 07:01:00,en,WEB,"  The Girls writer's new semi-autobiographical romcom is silly, touching - and world's away from the series that made her famous cancel email X WhatsApp Facebook link share Share bookmark Save share cancel email X WhatsApp Facebook link bookmark I wouldn't like to be Lena Dunham today. Eight years after her seminal, groundbreaking series Girls came to an end, her second-ever original TV show has finally arrived on Netflix (2018's Camping doesn't count – it was an American recreation of the British series created by Julia Davis). The pressure to recreate her own magic must be immense. But she needn't worry. With Too Much she's done it again. This romcom is a semi-autobiographical fictionalisation of how Dunham met and fell in love with her husband, English musician – and co-creator of the series – Luis Felber. This version of Dunham is Jessica, played by Megan Stalter, whose acerbic social media parody skits (an influencer pretending to be invited to a Charli XCX party; a business owner during Pride Month: “hi gay!”) landed her a role in the much-lauded sitcom Hacks. When we meet her in New York, Jessica is heartbroken and furious when she finds out her ex-boyfriend has started dating stunning influencer Wendy (Emily Ratajkowski). So when her boss (Girls alumnus Andrew Rannells) – who also happens to be the ex-husband of her sister (played by Dunham herself) – offers her a job in London, she jumps at the chance. But Jessica doesn't find the period drama, Jane Austen world she imagined; it turns out she has sorely misunderstood what an “estate” is. When she meets Felix (Will Sharpe) at a grotty pub's open mic night, the pair click almost immediately. He might be a walking red flag – he's a flailing musician with a precarious living arrangement, a historic drug addiction and a strained relationship with his family – but Jessica isn't exactly a catch, either. She's very self-absorbed, obnoxiously loud and works her way through her breakup by filming furious videos addressed to Wendy on a private social media account. Despite their flaws – or maybe because of them – Too Much is one of the most honest, realistic depictions of a modern romance I've ever seen. The grit of Girls is gone, but Dunham's talent for finding the truth in messy relationships shines through. There is the requisite fish-out-of-water transatlantic confusion (being given “a bollocking” can sound quite rude if you don't know what it means), but it's quickly done away with for something much deeper as the pair learn that sharing their traumas – as opposed to burying them and letting it explode in one another's faces – brings them closer. If that sounds a bit, well, too much, don't worry, the romcom never loses its sense of fun. From Rita Ora dressed as a fat Santa to Jessica having to shimmy her way down a drainpipe after getting locked in the toilet at a posh wedding, gleeful silliness can be found in each one of the 10 episodes. But the real marvel here is the performances. Stalter might grate on some, but that's entirely the point of her character – confident and capable yet neurotically dramatic. After a while, you'll find yourself warming to her shouty American-ness. Sharpe is a revelation as Felix, mumbling his way through Dunham's script with heartbreaking pathos and nonchalance that anyone who has been on a date with an edgy straight man will recognise. They're supported by an impressive rota of actors: Richard E Grant, Rhea Perlman, Rita Wilson, Stephen Fry, Andrew Scott and Naomi Watts are just a handful of the recognisable faces who pitch up. Surely a sign of the pull power Dunham has in the industry. It might be about a young woman finding her way in the world, but Too Much is a far cry from Girls. It's a little glossier, a little happier and not nearly as bold, moving the focus away from friendship to romantic love. But judged on its own merits, this romcom is a special slice of hopefulness that we have only seen glimpses of from Dunham in the past. I cried at the end of both series, but for very different reasons. 'Too Much' is streaming on Netflix EXPLORE MORE ON THE TOPICS IN THIS STORY..."
601fbcca14913714c73c4c92fb1e2e72,2025-07-10 09:44:00,en,WEB,"  Several months ago, I attended a BBQ- yes, we occasionally have clement weather in the Wairarapa in late Autumn. I talked to a High School teacher about career prospects for her students. During the conversation, she asked what advice I would give to her students concerning education and career paths they may be contemplating. Presumably, she considered the grey hairs amongst the blond as a sign of accumulated wisdom. The problem with this presumption can be summed up by an old adage: 'There is no fool like an old fool'. Anyway, even though the question belongs to the devil himself, I decided to rise to the challenge and was promptly arrested- this last bit didn't happen. So here goes Flaxen's perceived wisdom after nearly 70 years as a sentient being (Not a ferret) . First, it is impossible to compare the current 'life' situation with when I was eighteen, 51 years ago. The world has undoubtedly changed beyond comparison, socially, economically, technologically, geopolitically and industrially, and these changes have radically impacted the job market, and not necessarily to the good. At 16, I was about to graduate from High School (Stew Pony Secondary Modern). At that time, the British educational system was split into two categories: Secondary Modern and Grammar schools. Grammar schools were designed for pupils considering university training, while secondary modern schools focused on less academic careers. Regardless, most students in my class contemplated entering the trades, such as electricians, plumbers, builders, etc. And of those who applied, the vast majority managed to enter into an apprenticeship of their choice. O ne of my friends applied for a diesel mechanics apprenticeship while another became a draughtsman. Two other, older friends of mine job-hopped with ease. Admittedly, the jobs were basic, unskilled manual factory work. They obtained three jobs in one week and finally settled for Monk's pie factory, Brumagen. The point is that jobs and training programmes were plentiful. In addition, those exiting Grammar School education at 18 with A levels were qualified to enter the 'Hallowed Halls of Education', commonly known as universities. There, they could seek more cerebral pursuits and study toward a degree. At the time, about 5% of the UK population went forth to higher education. Contrast that with today's statistics, where 36.4% (2024 UK data) of pupils seek a university education. Universities are no longer venerable and venerated institutions of higher learning. Universities are thriving businesses touting degree courses to clueless students, knowing full well that the job prospects for vast swaths of students are grim. No matter how many students are engaged in useless degrees, the more that do, the more money the university makes. So, they produce glossy brochures exhorting the career prospects for students graduating with a Gender Studies degree. The secret: Any degree containing the word 'studies' is a scam. Al so, the glossier the brochure, the worse the prospects for a job, unless you really want that McDonald's position; students, take note. So what advice can I offer those fresh-faced and earnest 18-year-olds contemplating critical life choices? First, a fundamental truth needs to be stated boldly. University is not the giggle it once was. There is no 'free' ride as experienced by the 'Golden One'. Loans are required for expensive tuition and living expenses, and interestingly, fees have increased exponentially since the 70s- funny that. A degree circa 1970s was a passport to the professions, even those deemed useless today. Employers considered it a stamp on your academic respectability. Of course, entry and success in the best, as in high-paying, vocational professions have always been ring-fenced. Anecdote time: Entry into medical school in the UK has always been difficult and required the highest exam results. In the 70s, I worked as a trainee in a biochemistry laboratory. One day, I became involved in a casual conversation with a colleague. The individual had recently graduated from high school and was working in the lab for a year before attending medical school. Generally, three A levels at grade A are required to gain admission to med school in the UK. As the conversation developed, my erstwhile colleague let it be known that he had gained three A levels with the commonplace grade of three Cs. Usually, the bearer of such results would be ineligible for entry, especially in the prestigious Birmingham University Medical School. He eventually proffered the information that his father was Head of the Medical School- the scales fell from my eyes. The story underlies a vital life lesson: Life is easier with connections, and specific, usually high-paying professions have a tendency to be inherited. Let's drive the point in further and take a look at the uncontroversial figure of Hunter Biden. He passed the Bar in 1996 after a stint at Yale. He subsequently entered the gravy train and held multiple positions with varied financial returns, including consultancy, lobbyist, co-founder of various firms, and executive vice president. After being convicted of his second felony in 2024, Biden was facing potential gaol time of up to 25 years...."

mov_5F40130AA48D0370E808EAC950789558,2025-07-11 11:57:39,en,WEB,"  On 10th August 1979, what started as a reasonable demand by electricians at Thames Television to renegotiate an unsatisfactory proposed pay increase resulted in a mass walkout at fourteen of ITV's fifteen regional broadcasters, effectively taking the entire network off the air for a whopping eleven weeks. For the best part of three months, viewers desperate to find out what Sapphire And Steel were up to at that haunted railway station were greeted with nothing more than a static white on blue IBA slide bluntly stating that “we are sorry that programmes have been interrupted – there is an industrial dispute – transmissions will start again as soon as possible”. While the unaffected Channel Television gamely ploughed ahead, doubtless resorting to deploying week-long instalments of Puffin's Pla(i)ce, bereft ITV viewers reputedly to the tune of one million kept that slide on their screens in the vain hope that Bobby Ball might suddenly appear and exclaim “Normality resumed, Tommy!” . Those with something approaching a shred of sense, however, elected to switch over to the BBC. Fortunately for the BBC, by accident rather than by any kind of design they happened to have an impressive line-up of potential hits ready and waiting for their unanticipated influx of new viewers. David Attenborough's stunningly photographed history of evolution Life On Earth and Penelope Keith's new sitcom vehicle To The Manor Born both found a massive and hugely receptive audience and record viewing figures that they might not have met with otherwise; the former's lavishly illustrated tie-in book repeatedly sold out as the present-giving season approached, while viewers followed Audrey Fforbes-Hamilton's downsized will-they-won't-they antagonism with Grantleigh Manor's new owner Richard DeVere as if it was a ratings-dominating soap opera storyline. The BBC had been trailing behind ITV's glossier and more expensive Saturday afternoon imports for years, but suddenly The Dukes Of Hazzard and The Hardy Boys/Nancy Drew Mysteries were inspiring a million playground games involving pitch-perfect replications of the General Lee's horn and Pamela Sue Martin's running then stopping and looking round nervously then running again acting. A reasonable hit on its inaugural outing earlier in the year, full-tilt celebrity trash game show Blankety Blank became must-watch much-loved laugh riot appointment viewing virtually overnight. Over in Studio 6 of Television Centre, with the first recording block for The Nightmare Of Eden about to commence, the Doctor Who production team must surely have been following events with keen interest, especially in the knowledge that they already had a long overdue return appearance by the Daleks and another story filmed almost entirely in Paris under their belt for the forthcoming 'New Season' on BBC1. None of them, however, can really have anticipated just how huge everything was about to get. A new Dalek story with discotastically fashionable new secondary antagonists and the return of Davros which was guaranteed huge press coverage on account of the headline-friendly supporting cast alone nudging close to fifteen million viewers was one matter. The fact that the story that followed was an uproariously witty and grippingly inventive Douglas Adams-written runaround set and filmed in Paris that dominated excitedly speculative conversations for an entire month, featured a cliffhanger that thrillingly terrified an entire generation and included a sidesplitting cameo from John Cleese – not only fresh from the success of the second series of Fawlty Towers but also dominating headlines thanks to his wittily barbed responses to the controversy over Life Of Brian – was something else entirely. City Of Death could almost have been made specifically for its unexpectedly doubled audience and it notched up an almighty seventeen million viewers, making it not only the most watched Doctor Who story but also, at least as far as sizeable proportion of fans are concerned, the best story ever full stop. That said, it also represented a high watermark that it would be to say the least difficult to meet moving forwards, and this tacit weight of expectation – especially when it relates to a story broadcast in the closing weeks of a decade and thereby almost instantly by default an object of nostalgia – is one of the most notable amongst several potential causes of Doctor Who's declining profile during the decade that followed. Not everything else on offer from Doctor Who in 1979 alone, it has to be said, quite matched up to this standard, and while the first episode of the likeable but undistinguised The Creature From The Pit went out a couple of days after ITV resumed broadcasting on 24th October 1979 – an evening heralded by The Mike Sammes Singers triumphantly trilling 'Welcome, Welcome, Welcome Home to I! T! V!' but which soon descended into a lacklustre and threadbare lineup that included two interrupted mid-storyline soap operas and, with no small irony, the opening instalment of the downbeat and mutedly received Quatermass revival, which was noticeably short on “my dear, nobody could be as stupid as he seems”-level gags – but it is almost certain that everyone concerned drew a small sigh of relief that certain adventures later in the run had not found themselves under so intense a spotlight. Overall, however – and much like the rest of the BBC – they must have been feeling like they could not believe their luck, little realising that industrial action would derail their own plans almost immediately… Movellan Side Arms Killed The Radio Star Destiny Of The Daleks, it is fair to say, does not enjoy the loftiest of retrospective reputations. Even on the rare occasions on which it is afforded a degree of grudging respect on account of its storyline, humour or visual flair, it is nonetheless held up as a textbook example – much like all of those other supposed 'textbook examples' – of a Terry Nation story where three men all called Tarrant are scowlingly attempting to stop something that The Doctor eventually realises they are actually starting or whatever it is, complete with a sort of Wes Parmalee Davros with Doug Yule on songwriting duties which forced anyone who had enjoyed classic Genesis Of The Daleks because it was a classic to have to join the New York City Newsboys Strike of 1899. All of which, it cannot be emphasised enough, does not exactly tally with the experience of younger viewers late in 1979, ITV strike or otherwise, who simply heard a shout go up from the front room of “QUICK – it's half of a man and half of a Dalek” and hurtled in at a sideboard-colliding velocity to catch what they knew instantly was the best Doctor Who no arguments until a certain other half of a man incident later in that very same series. More to the point, such analyses invariably swerve any mention of the story's brand new secondary antagonists drawn from the same gloriously absurd realm of inspiration as the Voord, the Exxilons, the Kraals and the Mire Beast – Legs & Co.-jumpsuited Floella Benjamin-coiffured Hot Gossip-accessoried androids The Movellans, who unusually appeared to enjoy, if that's the right word, both tactical and technological superiority over the Daleks. About as Studio 54-ready a defining example of the Disco Sci-Fi phenomenon – which you can hear more about here, incidentally – as you are liable to find, the Movellans shared an unusually fashionable look that, as comical as it may appear from a present day perspective, you would have found all over Noel Edmonds' Multicoloured Swap Shop, The Kenny Everett Video Show and Top Of The Pops at the time. Indeed, sitting at the ..."

mov_30A4195599F4BC4BDEFD9255D7FBA073,2025-07-11 12:00:48,en,WEB,"  Lionheart is a story of wealthy elites that appeals to global audiences in a language they understand best. Image courtesy Netflix by Wunpini Fatimata Mohammed, Cornell University Netflix began its Africa operations in South Africa in 2016. When the US streaming giant announced it was setting up shop in Nigeria in 2020, many west African film-makers, writers, artists and media audiences were jubilant. Finally, west Africa's creativity and brilliance would be formally recognised on the world stage. Netflix Naija's purpose was to produce local content for Netflix just like Netflix South Africa and later Netflix Kenya. Some film-makers have been wary of US cultural imperialism happening through the market dominance of Netflix and other US streamers. Others have rushed to the streamer to sign deals that will gain their films and TV shows a global audience. Netflix's interest in African stories comes with a colonial power dynamic that research and scholarship has not fully explored. As a scholar of media and communication, I recently examined the effect US streamers are having on the stories being told in films in Nigeria and Ghana. In my study, I argue that despite the growing global interest in African pop culture, African creative workers need to be careful about interest from global conglomerates. We can't talk about African cinemas going global without paying attention to how Hollywood's colonial relationship with Africa has shaped and influenced what African filmmakers believe will sell globally. What price is being paid to appeal to global audiences? Film-makers might focus so much on the western gaze that they lose focus on telling African stories authentically and respectfully. In my study, I analyse various films including the Ghanaian film Azali and the Nigerian movie Lionheart to argue that that's exactly what's happening. Dancing to the tune of the west Despite the existence of thriving African film and TV industries before the advent of streaming technologies, we are seeing a replication of what I call the everydayness of colonialism in the area of media representations of the continent. Here, African filmmakers and producers find themselves jumping through hoops to tell stories that are “fit” to be streamed to Netflix's millions of American, European and global subscribers. Global cosmopolitan audiences are prioritised over African audiences. African audiences at home and in the diaspora are the reason we have vibrant film industries such as Nollywood to begin with. This displacement of African audiences happens both in representation and in access. Most African movie audiences do not have access to Netflix and other streaming platforms due to the digital divide and the cost of subscribing. So the target audience shifts to the elite, both African and global, who can afford to stream. Azali and Lionheart Ghana and Nigeria's film industries were developed by artists who wanted to reflect their societies to their communities. I found that with Netflix's arrival, there is a danger of disrupting and undoing this important work. The intervention of US streamers has led to the development of glossier versions of Africa. They are universal enough to be consumed by anyone, anywhere in the world, even if it means sacrificing the integrity of stories to achieve this global appeal. In Azali, for example, I found that the film sacrificed authentic language and geographical accuracy to tell a story for a western audience. [embedded content] Azali explores the themes of child marriage, child-trafficking and rural-urban migration in Ghana. Here, a film about the Dagbamba was set in the town of Zebilla, where Dagbanli is not the dominant language. The film cast non-Dagbanli speakers in major roles to speak a language they neither understood nor had any proficiency in. If Dagbamba had been centred as the primary audience of the movie, this cultural indignity might not have happened. Lionheart, though star-studded, departed from traditional Nollywood narrative conventions. The film tells the story of a wealthy Nigerian family and the quest of a young woman to take control of the family business. The movie had high production values and told a story that would be considered universally relatable. However, it was disqualified in its bid for an Oscar nomination in the Best International Feature Film category because of its majority English dialogue. Despite appealing to Netflix in the area of production quality and storyline, African film-makers were still punished by the Academy. [embedded content] Nigeria and Ghana's film industries have traditionally told a wide variety of African stories. Netflix's arrival is reducing African stories to narratives about the elite and for the global cosmopolitan elite. Stories about the majority of Africans are being erased. Africa becomes a backdrop to tell stories about the elite class. In my study, I argue that narrative construction is an important part of identity and that when external factors begin to determine how African stories are told, it distorts the image of Africa for Africans and raises questions of cultural sovereignty. Moving forward It is refreshing to see African cultures appreciated on a global scale. But this shouldn't erase narratives about the African masses and working communities. There are film-makers that are resisting the Netflix canon...."
mov_CC02BD5DEE41CE8E18EB1C22F95038B2,2025-07-11 21:08:48,en,WEB,"  Justin Bieber - Credit: Renell Medrano Just in case it's not clocking to you, Justin Bieber is so standing on business right now. The pop superstar is back with his excellent new surprise album Swag, a comeback he announced only hours before it dropped. It's been four years since we've gotten new music from Bieber, and he's got a lot to say, since he's been through it in recent years. It's got slick R&B, raw voice-memo rock guitar sketches, experimental collabos with Mk.gee and Dijon. He throws down with Cash Cobain, Gunna, and Sexyy Redd. Yet it's all him, as he chronicles the day-to-day struggles of Bieberhood. Bieber's last album was his 2021 Justice, a star-studded breakthrough spawning the hit “Peaches,” the most sensual tribute to the erotics of fruit since Harry Styles' “Watermelon Sugar” and “Cherry.” But at 31, he's taking stock of his adult life. He spends Swag addressing his tribulations, whether personal or business. As you may have heard, this guy's had some issues lately — becoming a dad, cancelling a massive tour to attend to mental health concerns, well-publicized altercations with the papparazzi, chaotic smoke-and-post social media rants, gossip about his marriage, descootifying his business life. There is so much healing going on in this album, it's no surprise Bieber includes three different “therapy sessions” with the comedian Druski, getting up close and personal about his life. “That's been a tough thing for me recently, is feeling like I have had to go through a lot of my struggles as a human, as all of us do, really publicly,” he confides. “And so people are always asking if I'm okay, and that starts to really weigh on mе.” That takes a toll. “It starts to make me feel like I'm the one with issues and everyone else is perfect.” But if he's looking to answer all the “what the hell's happening to this guy?” headlines, he couldn't do much better than Swag, because the musical energy and imagination here is Bieber at his most confident. Serious question: has he ever done as a song as appealing as “Butterflies”? A song this open-hearted, this melodic, this effusive, with a bittersweet R&B tune and pop uplift, plus a quivering guitar hook that comes straight from (of all people) the Smashing Pumpkins? Swag isn't just Bieber out to prove he's doing okay — he's out to top himself. He covers so much ground here musically, with the R&B pop glitz of “All I Can Take” and “Go Baby,” but also lo-fi acoustic demos. He works with ace producers like Carter Lang, Eddie Benjamin, and Tobias Jesso Jr, with a woozy Eighties R&B vibe. (Bieber, like the rest of us, has clearly been dangerously obsessed with SZA's SOS.) Some of the “therapy sessions” might hit the cringe button, but then, so do yours, probably. Druski shouldn't even bother applying for his therapist license, since his approach to counseling is to keep offering the patient a hit on some dubious cigar while cracking jokes. He assures Bieber, “Your skin white, but your soul Black, Justin. I promise you, man.” But he also clowns him about the infamous clip where he yells “I'm standing on business” at the papparrazzi. (“You can't pronunciate every word when you doing that!”) “Sweet Spot” is a slightly different kind of therapy session, where Bieber informs Sexyy Red, “I like it sticky between the sheets.” These two explore a little sexual healing for a freaky slow jam. “At first I was shy, but I'm a dog when I be in them sheets,” she raps. (Wait, when exactly was Sexyy Red's shy era? Did we just miss that?) “That's my G-spot, he make my coochie pop/I'm a changed woman, used to be a thot-thot/That's my boyfriend, I love him a lot.” Bieber spends a lot of time here singing about hanging on to his wife Hailey, with the pensive “Walking Away.” “Girl, we better stop before we say some shit,” he sings, in a genuinely wise lightbulb moment. “We've been testing our patience/I think we're better off if we just take a break and remember what grace is.” More in Celebrity He's making sure nobody doubts his commitment to being a husband and dad. “Go Baby” gives Hailey a pep talk, especially impressed by the fact that she built a lucrative beauty brand around a phone case. He sings, “That's my baby, she's iconic/iPhone case, lipgloss on it.” He celebrates fatherhood with “Dadz Love,” teaming up with the most based of gods, Lil B. They turn it into a universal we-are-family anthem, as Lil B urges, “We need more people to get together.” “Devotion” is a Dijon collaboration that goes even beyond what you'd hope: even warmer, more uplifting, more understatedly gorgeous, with discreet echoes of pedal-steel guitar over the country-soul harmonies. Along with “Butterflies,” it's the most immediately embraceable track on Swag. “Daisies” teams up with Mk.gee for a Phil Collins-style mid-Eighties synth-pop bop with distorted beats and Mr. Mister-style guitar, the kind of retro shopping-mall trip that makes you picture Toto listening to wild dogs cry out in the night. But some of the best moments on Swag come when he leaves the pop production behind and goes lo-fi. “Zuma House” is a stripped-down acoustic-guitar ballad in the mode of Neil Young's Hitchhiker, 83 seconds of raw beauty, while “Glory Voice Memo” is a bluesy micro-jam; both tracks sound like they got recorded on a phone and just uploaded straight to the album...."
mov_1F266297E16A01813A61DCEE34CBB3B0,2025-07-11 22:06:02,en,WEB,"  Whether it's a designer's rise from obscurity or the brand's roots in European heritage, these narratives aren't afterthoughts. When people think of successful startups, they often picture fast-paced tech companies, disruptive business models, and agile go-to-market strategies. On the other hand, the fashion industry — especially luxury brands — seems like a completely different world: elegant, timeless, exclusive. But beneath the surface, some of the most iconic fashion houses actually operate with the same branding brilliance that startup founders strive to achieve. In fact, the luxury sector holds powerful lessons for young businesses that want to build lasting impact, emotionally resonant identities, and loyal communities. Let's break down what early-stage entrepreneurs can learn from the high-fashion playbook — not just in terms of aesthetics, but in storytelling, positioning, and value perception. Storytelling as a Strategic Asset Every great fashion house has a story. Whether it's a designer's rise from obscurity or the brand's roots in European heritage, these narratives aren't afterthoughts — they are central to how the brand connects with its audience. Startups, too, can benefit immensely from mastering their origin story. Why was the company founded? What problem does it solve, and why does it matter? Founders who lead with authenticity and vision create a deeper emotional bond with early users or customers. Brands like Valentino, for example, have evolved over decades not just by designing products, but by building a mythos around Italian craftsmanship, individuality, and elegance. The story sells as much as the product — if not more. Perceived Value Is Often Greater Than Functional Value A luxury product isn't just about materials; it's about what it represents. A handbag or pair of shoes becomes a symbol of taste, class, or aspiration. Smart startups understand this principle and apply it in their own markets — even if their product is software, a wellness app, or a subscription box. It's the emotional hook — not just the utility — that builds customer loyalty. And just like high fashion has adapted to new economic realities through limited-time offers and online access, startups can blend exclusivity with accessibility. Today, even shoppers can enjoy a taste of luxury at a smarter price point thanks to curated platforms like Valentino Promo Codes from Valuecom, proving that timeless brands can still thrive in a digital-first, value-conscious world. Visual Identity and Consistency Matter From their logo typography to color schemes and packaging, luxury brands never cut corners on design consistency. Every Instagram post, ad campaign, and product launch is carefully curated to reflect the brand's DNA. Startups often move fast, which is good — but that can sometimes lead to a disjointed brand image. A clear, polished visual identity helps a company look more professional, more trustworthy, and more investment-worthy. Using high-end fashion brands as visual references — not to copy, but to learn — can help startups elevate their aesthetics without losing authenticity. Community Over Customers The best fashion brands don't just sell to customers — they cultivate communities of advocates. Whether through exclusive events, brand ambassadors, or social media engagement, they turn buyers into storytellers. For startups, community building is often the X-factor that drives organic growth. Think about platforms like Notion, Figma, or Glossier — their communities are part of the product experience. Following luxury fashion's lead, startups can prioritize user-generated content, limited beta access, and loyalty programs to fuel long-term growth. While products evolve and features change, a strong brand endures. Whether you're building a luxury fashion empire or a SaaS platform, your brand — how it feels, what it stands for, and how it's remembered — is your most valuable long-term asset. Luxury isn't just about price; it's about perception, intention, and connection. For startup founders, that's a lesson worth learning early."

That's exactly what happened when Beccaxbloom burst onto the scene. Forget overnight sensations built on gimmicks; Rebecca “Becca” Bloom's rise felt different. Starting in her cozy Portland apartment during the pandemic's isolating days, she shared unfiltered moments – messy kitchen experiments, vulnerable chats about anxiety, and joyful dances in mismatched socks. It wasn't just relatable; it was a breath of fresh air. Fast forward three years, and Beccaxbloom isn't just a username; she's a movement. With over 8 million followers across Instagram and TikTok, collaborations with global brands like Glossier, and a thriving mental health initiative, she embodies what it means to bloom authentically in the digital age. Her journey proves that isn't just a catchy phrase – it's her reality, resonating deeply in a world craving real connection. Beccaxbloom: Blooming into the Digital Limelight with Authentic Charm Beccaxbloom's ascent wasn't accidental; it was built on a foundation of unwavering authenticity that made millions feel seen. While influencers often chase trends, Becca, a 28-year-old former graphic designer from Portland, Oregon, started simply by sharing her “real, unedited days” in early 2020. Her first viral moment came unexpectedly. A tearful, makeup-free TikTok video about struggling with lockdown loneliness and body image struck a chord, amassing over 2 million views in 48 hours. People weren't just watching; they were commenting, “This is exactly how I feel,” and “Thank you for being real.” This raw honesty became her signature. Unlike the highly produced content dominating feeds, Becca's posts felt like chatting with a close friend – complete with laughter, occasional stumbles, and profound insights. Her content pillars seamlessly blend everyday relatability with uplifting positivity: “Morning Realness” Vlogs: Unscripted glimpses into her routine – from meditation wins to burnt toast fails – celebrating imperfection. “Bloom Chats” Live Sessions: Deep, empathetic discussions on mental wellness, relationships, and self-acceptance. Creative Expression: Whimsical DIY projects, watercolor painting sessions, and impromptu living-room dances showcasing her artistic roots. This approach fueled explosive growth. She hit 1 million Instagram followers within 18 months, a testament to her resonant message. Major publications like Teen Vogue and Bustle featured her as a leader in the “authenticity wave,” highlighting her refusal to use heavy filters or promote unrealistic standards. Her impact is measurable: engagement rates consistently double platform averages, and hashtags like #BloomWithMe and #RealNotPerfect , sparked by her, have garnered billions of views. Users share their own vulnerable stories, creating a supportive community. This organic, trust-based connection is the core of Beccaxbloom: Blooming into the Digital Limelight with Authentic Charm . She didn't just gain followers; she cultivated a tribe united by shared vulnerability and growth. Understanding how her authenticity reshaped audience expectations is crucial in analyzing modern social media success, as discussed in our exploration of evolving digital community dynamics. The Roots of Resilience: Becca's Journey Before the Likes Long before hashtags and brand deals, Becca's character was forged through experiences that shaped her empathetic worldview. Born in Seattle but raised primarily in Portland, Oregon, she grew up in a creative, supportive household. Her mother, a music teacher, and father, a landscape architect, encouraged curiosity and self-expression. However, Becca faced significant challenges. Diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder at 15, she navigated high school feeling isolated. “I felt like I was performing all the time, terrified people would see the 'messy' me,” she shared in a poignant 2022 interview. Art became her sanctuary – filling sketchbooks with intricate drawings and finding solace in writing poetry. After graduating from the University of Oregon with a BFA in Graphic Design in 2017, Becca worked at a Portland marketing agency. While successful, she felt creatively stifled and emotionally drained. The pressure to project constant professionalism clashed with her internal struggles. The pandemic lockdown in March 2020 became a pivotal turning point. Furloughed and isolated, she started an anonymous Instagram account, “@blooming_through,” initially as a personal visual diary. Her early posts were simple: a photo of a rainy window with reflections on uncertainty, a sketch of a wilting plant captioned “Still growing, even on hard days.” The anonymity provided safety, allowing her to share fears about her mental health and career doubts with startling honesty. This raw vulnerability resonated with others feeling similarly adrift. Her follower count grew steadily into the thousands, primarily through word-of-mouth shares in online support groups. By late 2020, embracing her full identity, she rebranded as Beccaxbloom , signaling a commitment to bloom openly, not anonymously. This period wasn't glamorous; it was foundational. The resilience built through her personal struggles became the bedrock of her authentic online presence, proving that Beccaxbloom: Blooming into the Digital Limelight with Authentic Charm was rooted in real-life perseverance long before the spotlight found her. Viral Moments and Major Milestones: The Meteoric Rise Beccaxbloom's transition from relatable creator to digital powerhouse was marked by specific, game-changing moments that showcased her unique appeal...."

Moroccanoil's Mini Must-Haves Sampler, which is so affordable that I'm not not pinching myself to make sure I'm awake. Reviewers especially love these teensy versions for traveling in ~luxury~ on the cheap, and for trying these beloved splurge-worthy products without committing to the whole price first! This handy travel set includes deluxe sample sizes of Moroccanoil hair treatment, shampoo, conditioner, styling cream, and shower gel.

They're perfect as a gift or just for your own use. So worth it!"" —Alehandra Get it from Amazon for $10. 2. Dr Teal's ""Hawaiian Bliss"" Epsom salt magnesium soak, a ~limited edition~ blend of red sea salt, papaya, and hibiscus, reviewers are so in love with that a ton of them are buying extra bags (or literally hoarding them) before the brand runs out. One reviewer went so far as to call it ""heaven in a bag!"" Read more about how an epsom salt soak or bath can help with stress and muscle relaxation at Cleveland Clinic. Promising review: ""I bought this product hoping for a fresh, divine scent, and wow, it completely blew me away!

The scent is absolutely heavenly; rejuvenating, relaxing, and somehow energizing at the same time. After using it, I feel calmer, refreshed, and even a little happier. I genuinely look forward to using it. I'm already planning to order more, not just for myself but to include in gift baskets for friends and family. If you're on the fence, go for it. Highly recommend!"" —K. Marie Get it from Amazon for $5.87. 3. A limited edition (!!) Eos Marshmallow ""Super Balm"" lip treatment from the brand's ""secret menu"" so good that reviewers say it's better than Carmex for healing and better than Summer Fridays for quality. Lip care that also tastes like you're perpetually eating a s'more for less than $5?? My friends, life is good. Check out a TikTok of the marshmallow lip treatment in action. Promising review: ""My new must-have! My number one go-to for healing lips was Carmex. This beat it. I love the consistency (very creamy/smooth), it's not heavily flavored or goopy, and it obviously smells amazing. It isn't overbearing and also doesn't keep coating your mouth like the Eos stick balms (still great, but more wax)."" —Breanah Shirazi Get ti from Amazon for $4.99 (also available in Strawberry Acai). 4. A set of cheerful Lego botanical ""happy plants,"" aka your new favorite coworkers. How can capitalism bring you down when these two are smiling up at you all day long?

From the moment I opened the box, I was impressed by the thoughtfully organized bags and clear instructions, making the build both enjoyable and manageable.
