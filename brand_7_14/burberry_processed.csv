Do you think a grown adult shelling out huge amounts of cash on Labubu dolls is ridiculous? Well, maybe it is, but they are thinking exactly the same thing about your limited edition Nike Air Jordans. They've been discussing this on the AskUK subreddit after user One_Tumbleweed_565 asked this: Everyone can spend their money however they please but, in your opinion, what is the biggest waste of money purchase? I cannot understand spending money on a private reg for a car. MAYBE for a business and the private reg is business related. A personal one, I just don't get it. And people were not backwards in coming forwards when it came to dunking on other people's shopping choices. 1. 'Cars in general. Too many people have them on expensive monthly contracts, that aren't really within their means, just because they want a flashy car. The interest can be crazy if you're not careful, and you often don't even own the car at the end of the contract. In most circumstances, you'd be dramatically better off either saving up for a good while to buy one outright (although I know that's not always possible if you have a sudden need for a car etc) or but it's also often much cheaper to take out a personal loan to buy a car outright then pay back the loan rather than these finance deals people do.' ‚ÄìConor2704 2. 'Astroturf. Covering your lawn in plastic does not make it look like a pleasant garden and doesn't compensate for your inability to manage a tiny patch of land. Just learn how to garden.' ‚ÄìRadiant_Incident4718 3. ‚ÄùHealing Crystals', the NHS would be selling them if they worked.' ‚ÄìMrSMT88 4. 'Excessive takeaway deliveries. It's at least ¬£25-¬£30 for two people to have a takeaway. People who do that three or four times a week are utterly insane in my book.' ‚ÄìYeorge 5. 'Smoking. Why not cut out the middle man that ruins your health and just burn money?' ‚ÄìSilverellaUK 6. 'Some contract phones. I see people complaining about their phone bills being ¬£60+ a month just so they have the latest phone.' ‚ÄìSoft-Square-8929 7. 'Weddings, biggest waste of money there is.' ‚ÄìGlad-Animator-1030 8. 'Designer clothing, or just anything designer. I'm not talking about 'base' designer brands like Boss, Diesel, Lacoste, Nike etc since I'm prone to spending money on nice clothes here and there, I mean spending hundreds and sometimes even thousands on brands like Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Palm Angles, Burberry. Literally the biggest waste of money, paying for the brand only to wear a t shirt that looks exactly the same as one you can buy from Tesco for ¬£10. Sure, I guess if you can afford it you only live once right? But Jesus, and I've even heard of people using Klarna to pay for these things.

mov_E4C8EE048D07C36FA883256C2E807560,2025-06-14 20:00:49,es,WEB,"‚Äâ SPR_COMBO[es]Acabo de terminar de leer un brillante ensayo que disecciona las tribus urbanas alojadas en los alrededores de los cayetanos y los pijos. ‚ÄúQuiero y no puedo‚Äù, el libro de Raquel Pel√°ez, radiograf√≠a c√≥mo, desde el nacimiento de la clase media, algunos individuos/as han querido revestirse de los atributos de las clases superiores, sean arist√≥cratas, famosos o, sencillamente, ricos de cuna. Con escaso √©xito, claro, porque aunque la mona se vista de seda y todo eso. Ese fen√≥meno de lo aspiracional ha trasladado a la sociedad la idea de que comprando un bolso de Vuitton tus semejantes te equiparar√°n a la Falc√≥ o a la Georgina, por ejemplo. La cosa es que los ricos riqu√≠simos han llevado el lujo a otro nivel y las marcas no marcas, fuera del alcance del mortal, son lo que les priva. Un Vuitton, ¬°menuda ordinariez de clase media! (aunque cueste el sueldo de un trimestre de algunos). Cu√°nto da√±o ha hecho hist√≥ricamente la emulaci√≥n y, como pasa en otros campos, las redes sociales no han hecho m√°s que reforzar hasta el paroxismo la estupidez de los b√≠pedos. Antes segu√≠an al Beau Brummel o al duque de Windsor unos pocos, ahora la Kardashian es ejemplo al mismo tiempo para millones de ni√±as bien, burguesitas de medio pelo y poligoneras. Qu√© horror. Cuando era algo m√°s joven que ahora, digamos en los setenta, jej√©, mi ideal aspiracional era un polo Lacoste (o Burberry's), una Barbour, vaqueros Chevignon y mocasines Castellano, comprados en su tienda de la zona hiperpija de Madrid (y que eran copia de los Sebago, aunque luego los tuve tambi√©n y me parecen mucho peores, patriota que es uno). Obviamente era un pijo con √≠nfulas aunque me espantara tal definici√≥n, pero, como dice la autora, todos somos el modelo de pijo de alguien, es cuesti√≥n de escalas. Como reconocer que todos somos el cu√±ao de otros cu√±aos y as√≠ hasta el infinito. Sin embargo hay algo curioso en esta tesis del pijer√≠o global: de alg√∫n modo los modelos aspiracionales impiden la revoluci√≥n y la lucha de clases por v√≠as violentas, lo que es un negocio redondo para las clases altas. Si un empleado de bajo nivel aspira a comprarse unas Jordan de las prohibitivas, de las que lleva alg√∫n rapero, estar√° calladito ganando un salario raqu√≠tico y sin montar pollos. Cuando las consiga, se las calce y las ense√±e (si no se cuenta, algo no existe, como dijo Domingu√≠n tras acostarse con Ava Gardner) pensar√° que est√° al nivel de un futbolista famoso y se conformar√° en su mediocridad. Lo mismo que la que est√° loca por unos ‚ÄúManolos‚Äù o unos Louboutin. Que es lo que nos pasa mas o menos a todos, por otra parte, salvando a los anacoretas y las monjas de clausura. Si bien se fijan, es un c√≠rculo perfecto: las c√∫pulas promueven el lujo como requisito aspiracional, los pardillos caemos en la trampa por af√°n de imitaci√≥n, nos entrampamos para compartir con las √©lites un rango de consumo y somos ya esclavos de por vida de empresarios y bancos. Sin darnos cuenta de que, cuando nosotros avanzamos un paso, ellos dan cuatro y cada vez est√°n m√°s lejos. Pero, bueno, lo aspiracional no va s√≥lo de ropa y complementos, hay quienes tienen la ilusi√≥n de ser ‚Äúcosa‚Äù y son capaces de vender a su madre por alcanzar un nivel que no les corresponde. Este caso es tan rid√≠culo como pretender ser el duque de Alba poni√©ndose una ‚Äúteba‚Äù, esa americana informal creada para el tiro de pich√≥n, tan c√≥moda. Dec√≠a que pretender ser, con un grado √≠nfimo de cultura general y una inteligencia emocional lindante con la del gorila de monta√±a, no es ni mucho menos imposible. Tenemos ejemplos en Alicante, en la pol√≠tica y hasta en las instituciones, y hoy no me har√°n decir nombres ni bajo tortura. Piensen un poco, que para eso ustedes tienen c√©lulas grises en el cerebro y ellos (o ellas), no. El caso es que lo aspiracional conduce a la melancol√≠a, porque despu√©s de hacer un v√≠deo en TikTok con fondo fake, tal que si estuvieran en un resort exclusivo en las Maldivas, apagan los focos, decae la magia y vuelven al piso oscuro alquilado en un barrio obrero. Pero a algunos les compensa, dejan de hacerse preguntas y so√±ar con ser y no √∫nicamente con tener. Trampa saducea esta de desear los bienes del pr√≥jimo. Antes se curaba con la revoluci√≥n y la toma del Palacio de Invierno o las guillotinas dale que te pego en la plaza de la Concorde. Ahora basta con un poco de consumo y un mucho de fingir en redes. Por lo menos la toma de la Bastilla ten√≠a efectos taumat√∫rgicos y los arist√≥cratas se lo pensaban un poco y tem√≠an por sus vidas y haciendas. Con una story en instagram se parten de risa, si es que llega a su conocimiento. Que ya les dijo yo que no."

This past year has been a whirlwind of creativity, strategy, and growth ‚Äî and I've had the chance to work on unforgettable real-world projects with iconic brands: Parfums Christian Dior ‚Äì Designed a Gen Z fragrance collection and promotional plan. L'Or√©al x La Roche-Posay USA Bootcamp ‚Äì Built a product concept and 360¬∞ campaign for next-gen UV protection. Veepee ‚Äì Developed e-commerce strategies to engage younger audiences. McKinsey & Company ‚Äì Crafted consulting strategies for platform growth. DDB x Amazon ‚Äì Led a social media strategy to spotlight Amazon's sustainability efforts. Kering x DoDo Jewels ‚Äì Selected as finalists to present a 360¬∞ market expansion strategy for DoDo Jewels. Cartier ‚Äì Created storytelling and launch strategy for Cartier Home new collection. Our team won 1st placeü•á and was invited to a private Cartier piano concert. Another highlight: our London learning expedition, where we visited Burberry, Cartier, and Warner Bros. Discovery HQs, and connected with the HEC UK Alumni House. I was deeply inspired by the powerful voices of women leaders in marketing and luxury. To my incredible marketing crew ‚Äî thanks for all the brainstorms, good vibes, and late-night laughs. And to our amazing program directors Gachoucha Kretz, PhD and Marion BOUYOU ‚Äî thank you for crafting a journey that was both challenging and deeply rewarding. When I enrolled in this program, I never expected to grow this much ‚Äî but it truly prepared me to become a better marketing leader, with stronger creativity, strategic thinking, and empathy. I'm thrilled to share my next chapter: I'll be joining The Est√©e Lauder Companies Inc.

062d53dd0cb3d1dbb45e34dfcd940ac5,2025-06-18 04:17:00,en,WEB,"‚Äâ ""Damn. These guys are robbing the place. It's affecting everyone."" We've read and enjoyed Les Cam√©l√©ons, the investigation into the fake bank adviser scam. The book is already out of stock on Amazon, just one week after its release. And that's to be expected, because it's a real page turner, well written and well researched. It's also a chilling investigation because it reveals a little-known and little-shown part of the behind-the-scenes world of phone-spoofing, banking, telephone operators and KYC. The law - and its representatives - on the other hand, appear motivated and embodied, simply overwhelmed from the outset, because of their limited resources in relation to the scale of the fraud, and the precautions they have to take to hit hard and effectively. To convince you to read all 250 pages, here are a few extracts from Thibaut Martinez-Delcayrou's book, published by Flammarion. And perhaps ask yourself three questions, depending on who you are and what you do. The ones that came to mind at the end of a memorable reading experience. Who, when, how many ? To be known Me Sylvie Noachovitch and Arnaud Delomel ( located in Paris and Rennes) are two of the rare french lawyers who has helped french victims to be reimbursed by their bank (BNP-Paribas). Read here. The ""fake advisor"" scam consists of calling the victim to ""help"" them stop alleged fraud on their account and asking them to approve transactions or asking them for their login details and then carrying out transactions from their personal account. A new variant involves sending a courier to the victim's home to collect a supposedly faulty bank card. AMF warning, in December 2024. A must read book as thrilling as a Stephen King, Jean-Patrick Manchette or Iain Levison one. Who ... to play Marine Fontange ? Marine Fontange is a young and tenacious examining magistrate. After spending six years at the financial division, one evening she is assigned to the DSK case. Because Dominique Strauss-Kahn, like many other Frenchmen, was also involved in a fake bank adviser scam. As an American Express customer, the former minister was relieved of ‚Ç¨8,950. However, unlike many other victims, he will be reimbursed by his bank. All banks were involved, including the Caisse d'Epargne, the bank of the author, who was also the victim of a damn good ‚Äútelemarketer‚Äù on a match night. In my pocket, my phone vibrates. It's the Caisse d'Epargne. Mr Martinez-Delcayrou. I hate my bank (...) How many times have I lost my nerve in the afternoon when my banker's answering machine told me that I'd have to call back in the morning to have the privilege of speaking to her directly. Understand, you have the right to have an emergency, but only between 9am and midday. This time it's different. The call is coming from much higher up. Sorry to disturb you, Dominique Bertrand, from the Caisse d'Epargne fraud department (...) Is it really you who initiated the transfer of the sums of ‚Ç¨1,400 and ‚Ç¨850 from your account a few minutes ago? When did it happen? Over a million victims in France. Over a billion looted. When will this affect you? The Chameleons is a breathless thriller about a gigantic modern-day scam: more than a million French people have been affected and the loot is said to be in excess of a billion euros. Every day, each Paris police station registers between one and ten complaints. And 2025 looks set to be even worse. The author of the book spent more than a year investigating at the heart of the PJ and lawyers' offices, and met examining magistrates, Oscar, the BFMP police officer, and MP Christophe Naegelen, during the implementation of MAN, the number authentication mechanism, which was supposed to enable action to be taken against fraud. Was. Based on STIR/SHAKEN technology, MAN was supposed to deal a fatal blow to spoofing fraud. ""It won't. The crooks realised that all they had to do to fool the French was to use a foreign telephone operator. The scammers tell me that they use the following operators: Plivo and Flowroute"". Breathless and perfectly documented, the investigation takes the reader into the mysteries of call centres dedicated to KYC, the justice system and the police, whose efficiency and speed we discover, although their resources appear disproportionate compared to the agility of the bandits. One of the features of the book is that the young journalist who wrote it, an ex-Canal + contributor, is not a fan of circumlocutions. He names things, the protagonists, and manages to :..."

This season, Burberry Festival takes centre stage, reimagining British fashion through the lens of music, rebellion, and raw self-expression. It's a tribute to the cultural pulse of the '90s ‚Äî the era of Cool Britannia, when fashion wasn't just about what you wore, but what you stood for. Back then, the lines between catwalk and curb blurred. Bands like Oasis and Blur weren't just shaping sound ‚Äî they were shaping style. Britpop swagger met underground grunge, and Burberry's iconic check became more than a motif; it became a symbol of defiant individuality. Now, that same energy is back‚Äîrecharged, remixed, and lit up under festival lights. Cropped Reversible Check Jacket | Belted Check Denim Shorts | Horseshoe Crossbody Bag | Rubber Marsh Stamp High Boots | Burberry Cropped Reversible Check Jacket | Belted Check Denim Shorts | Horseshoe Crossbody Bag | Rubber Marsh Stamp High Boots | Burberry Burberry's latest collection captures this spirit perfectly: trenches thrown over sheer layers, signature checks clashing with vintage-wash denim, and boots made for dancing long after dark. The look is loud, effortless, and made for the mud-slicked, music-fuelled fields of summer. This isn't about dressing up ‚Äî it's about dressing real. Our shoot doesn't aim for polish. It's reactive, loose, and sometimes out of focus ‚Äî the way real festival memories are. There's movement. There's mud. The sound is great, the signal's bad, and everyone's peeling off layers only to throw them back on as the sun sets. Burberry's codes are all still here ‚Äî the check, the cut, the quiet British confidence ‚Äî but they've been softened by weather, blurred by motion, and worn in by the day. Knight"

Natalie Slater and husband Steven, both 45, flew to Cape Verde with children Alifie, 13, and Amelia, seven, on what was supposed to be a dream holiday. However, business owner Natalie claimed she and Steven woke up on day two of the trip with a severe case of itchy sores all over their bodies after staying at Melia Tortuga Hotel. ""I could feel biting at night time,"" Natalie, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, claimed to Luxury Travel Daily. ""I sprayed mosquito spray on the bed and had plug ins."" She claimed: ""Amelia started getting bitten on her face then my son got bitten. My husband said I looked like a pepperoni pizza because I was covered in that many bites. ""They were shockingly painful, itchy and had pus in them. There were more and more every day so we looked under the mattress and behind the bed."" She alleged: ""The mattresses were covered in brown blood stains and there were bed bug shells on the floor. I was absolutely horrified. I stormed to see the rep who was amazing and couldn't do enough to help. ""She told the hotel to do an investigation but they never came so me, my husband and two children sat up all night on the settee."" Natalie alleged: ""Amelia was crying, sat up on the settee. She had 25 bites on her face. I didn't know what to do. I got my torch out in the pitch black and took photos of the bugs on the bed at 2am.‚Äù The family-of-four said they slept on a sofa in a five-star hotel during their two-week break. Natalie said she reported the insects to staff and they promised to send someone to investigate. But she said they never came, leaving the family forced to share a couch, they claimed. TUI got a third party contractor to assess the room on the same day Natalie made the report and that there was no evidence of bed bugs, just mosquitos. The travel company had no reports from other guests either. TUI also claimed they moved the family to a new room and offered to wash their clothes, and maintained there was no evidence of bed bugs in the room. Natalie added: ""We couldn't settle but we had two children and had to try and make the most of it. I cried every day. I wanted to go home but it would have been ¬£400 each and we didn't have that money."" Natalie says she decided to leave ¬£800 worth of clothes behind because she claimed they could have bedbugs on them. She did bring home ¬£2,000 worth of designer gear that she says she'll have to replace. Natalie said: ""We had thousands of pounds of designer clothes that are in a suitcase in the garage. There were Casablanca shirts that are ¬£350 a pop, pairs of crocs for ¬£40, sandals, FCUK tops, Stone Island clothes, Amelia had a Burberry dress and ¬£25 rucksacks. We can't afford to replace all that."" The Daily Star has reached out to TUI and Melia Tortuga Hotel for comment.

mov_7AE6C4C6074F2CCCD2B9FD3E905A958D,2025-06-19 08:22:09,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Lennon Gallagher kept it casual as he led the stars out and about at the Burberry Festival Pub Quiz in Notting Hill on Wednesday evening. The son of Liam Gallagher and Patsy Kensit opted for a khaki plaid jacket which he paired with a simple black Burberry Tee. He completed the look with a pair of dark blue oversized jeans, smart black shoes and large black sunglasses as he was seen puffing on a cigarette outside the venue. Meanwhile Mia Regan embraced a more preppy look as she paired a stylish checked playsuit with a grey short-sleeved polo jumper. Putting on a leggy display in the ensemble the model, 22, added a statement pair of dark green leather boots and black and white plaid handbag. Sugababes star Keisha Buchanan also made sure to flash plenty of skin in a black mini dress as she strode down the street. The singer, 40, covered up in a dark khaki Burberry coat with a plaid feature panel on one side. She added a pair of tortoise brown framed sunglasses, beige leather ankle boots and a white leather handbag. Keisha was joined by her fellow Sugababes Mutya Buena and¬†Siobh√°n Donaghy after the threesome recently performed at Radio 1's Big Weekend last month. Mutya, 40, put on a very busty display in a bralette top which she wore underneath a stylish cream trench coat. The singer accessorised the look with a pair of gradient lens square shades, Burberry headband and black sandals. Elsewhere Siobh√°n kept it more casual in a pair of light denim jeans, black T-shirt and famous Burberry trench coat. Jordan Stephens opted for a summery ensemble in beige linen trousers and a plaid shirt which he wore open over a white T-shirt which read 'Love You'. Nick Grimshaw also opted for a plaid shirt over a white T-shirt which he paired with straight legged denim jeans and shades. It has been a busy week for Lennon after he attended day one of Royal Ascot on Tuesday. The aspiring singer was joined by his girlfriend Isobel Richmond who opted for an elegant, pale pink slip dress tat featured floral detailing and ruffles across the shoulders. Lennon wore a grey top hat, which he teamed with a tailored jacket and a beige waistcoat by Gieves & Hawkes. As well as modelling, Lennon has also followed in his father's footsteps by making music with his band Automotion. Last year Lennon - who has graced Italian Vogue and appeared at London Fashion Week - spoke candidly to MailOnline about the world of modelling and admitted it can be 'difficult at times'. He was first scouted at the age of 16 while walking down Brick Lane and he explained: 'I was walking in Brick Lane, and I was like, 16. 'I just got an army jacket and I was walking away from the store, this woman pulled me over and was like, ''You should be a model, take this card. We have a shoot in Africa, you should do it''.' Noting the situation seemed 'sketchy', Lennon went on: 'I didn't do the shoot because it seemed really sketchy, so I told my mum and she was like, ''If you want to get into it, I know some people''.' Lennon told how he reaches out to his agent if ever he feels unsure about a shoot or casting call. 'It's always pretty difficult putting yourself up for castings and stuff and putting yourself out there,' he stated. 'And then there's like hundreds of people who maybe look a bit like you, look so different to you, and like everyone is going in and out, and you're like, ''I'm not going to get this!''' Lennon admitted: 'You kind of do get a bit insecure, I can't lie,' before noting the importance of asking for help. 'For the context of being in the studio, if there's something you don't like you can always call your agent and they are always willing to help you out. 'They'll always try to help you out to their best ability. You're not alone. 'You should never feel like you should be pushed into something you don't want to do.'"

mylrwrp,2025-06-19 09:46:35,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ See you are in office and you are wearing Hawas that is the first thing you did wrong if you want to get noticed , like i'd rather like to not get noticed with Hawas lol while i have not even sniffed it once . I am saying this because it is the same invictus style DNA while i respect the OG it is mass pleasing it is very well done but it is generic and like you said people with edge got edge umm everyone smells the same :P . You know i wear invictus or one of its clone that i got which is Lattafa hayyati once in a while when i'm hanging out with really young people or even sometimes alone and i love how salty/musky/ambergreasy invictus get as the scent transitions personally i like that but i will never use it in office. You are wrong when you said to not use expensive/ moderately expensive fragrances in the office . Stop thinking about compliments just wear your shit and do your work stay laser focused and in your vibe . . wear your fragrance and not let it wear you off . Time you spend with a fragrance is more of a personal experience like I will never ever feel-good wearing Edge at this point of time in life, but I certainly appreciate people who like it that means they like the DNA and everyone with time will up their fragrance game all blessings to all the readers. I suggest you to get some good decants of ME fragrances and designers also make the best use of your budget as it is important to feel good while you are working and again fragrance is a personal experience on top of everything so quality matters , discover what else you like mate. Some random fragrances that came to my mind for you is Eros flame EDP , Mr. Burberry EDP, eau intense vetiver Hermes , Valentino Uomo Intense 2021. Peace"

mynk6jx,2025-06-19 16:14:16,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Some of my favorite affordable fragrances that smell higher end. Now my disclaimer is that I wear whatever scents I want all year long so I'm not always the best at saying what's good in warm vs cold weather üòÇ I also recommend spraying your clothes if you don't mind doing that. Bath and Body Works Midnight Temptation, pair it with the lotion to up longevity. It's very similar to Black Opium Le Parfum. Just spray the heck out of your body and clothes. Sol De Janeiro the edt paired with 62 body spray. This is actually a summer scent for me, so I get the 8ml in the edt and a small body spray, theis will be about $40 to $50 for both, but the sprays go on sale a lot. If you can swing a small bum bum cream and the glow oil, I highly recommend. This is a compliment getter! I wouldn't recommend blind buying but a lot of Mancera perfumes are crazy strong. I got a 4oz of Roses vanille on Jomashop for $60ish. I've barely made a dent cuz she's strong! Lattafa Liam Grey less than $25 for 100 ml bottle. This is a dupe for BDK Gris Chanel, but it's stronger and longer lasting. This smells like money, but I would recommend testing out the OG to see if you like that scent DNA. Adam Levine, around $15 but I've seen it way lower. This smells way more expensive than what it is and it projects. Avon Imari Elixir. It smells niche. You can find it on EBay with free delivery for less than  $15. If you are a fan of roses- French Avenue Rose Explosion. This is like being at the flower shop and you walk in right as they are cutting down the rosettes to make a bouquet, you smell  fresh petals, leaves, and stems. It's a dupe for atomic rose. $22 on Amazon Paris Hilton Gold Rush pair it with the body spray. It smells really good, the best in the line. You can get both, 100 ml perfume and 8oz spray for less than $40 on Amazon. Guess Seductive Noir. So good. Very similar to Mon Guerlain. $22 for a 2.5 0z bottle and $13 for the body spray on Amazon. People rave about this fragrance and it deserves all the hype! Narciso Rodriguez has a lot of great perfumes $60 or under. I really like For Her edt and Musc Noir Rose (this would probably be too musky), the projection is good on both, stays on clothes until you wash them. Lattafa Mayar Natural Intense. A freshy that projects and has some longevity. $20 on Amazon. Lattafa Angham. This is beautifully done. And it projects and lasts longer than Burberry Goddess. $30ish on Amazon. Lastly if you really want to project and you don't get headaches try Ciara by Revlon. She's strong and surprisingly unique. Less than $15 on Amazon. You can probably find some of these even cheaper but Im addicted to 2 day shipping"

mov_7BC3AEFE9D6F3E35A2C6E94139A9ED0D,2025-06-19 18:00:48,en,WEB,"‚Äâ luxury Market Faces headwinds: Disillusionment and Declining Engagement The global luxury market is experiencing a notable slowdown, a situation not seen since the financial crisis of 2008-2009, with the exception of the pandemic-induced dip in 2020. Recent analysis indicates a challenging period ahead, driven by a complex interplay of economic pressures, geopolitical instability, and a growing disconnect between luxury brands and their consumers. A Shift in Consumer Sentiment Beyond macroeconomic factors like fluctuating currencies and rising geopolitical tensions, a core issue is emerging: luxury consumers are increasingly disillusioned. The rapid price increases implemented post-pandemic have disrupted the conventional value proposition of luxury goods, leaving many questioning the justification for escalating costs. This isn't simply about affordability; it's about perceived value. As one industry expert noted, consumers struggle to reconcile substantial price hikes with a lack of demonstrable innovation. For instance, a handbag that previously retailed for $1,200 now costing $2,000 feels disproportionate without a corresponding leap in design or craftsmanship. this sentiment is especially pronounced among younger demographics, who are ofen the driving force behind luxury trends. They are more attuned to authenticity and value, and less willing to accept price increases that aren't supported by genuine innovation. This shift in mindset is contributing to a broader trend of emotional detachment from luxury brands. Declining Market Numbers & Consumer base The impact of this disillusionment is reflected in recent market performance. The luxury market saw a 1% decline to $418 billion (‚Ç¨364 billion) in 2023 at current exchange rates, remaining flat when adjusted for constant rates. More significantly, the luxury consumer base has shrunk. Over the past two years,the market has lost approximately 50 million customers,bringing the total estimated number of luxury consumers worldwide down to 353 million from 400 million in 2022. This isn't merely a temporary pause in purchasing; it represents a genuine alienation from the industry. Engagement with luxury brands is waning across all demographics, not just aspirational buyers. Data reveals a concerning trend: brand-related searches have decreased by over 40%, and social media follower growth has plummeted by a staggering 90%. These declines are directly linked to price fatigue and a perceived lack of creative momentum. In 2024, preliminary data suggests this trend is continuing, with some brands reporting double-digit declines in key product categories. The Creative Director Carousel & Its Consequences The luxury industry's reliance on artistic creativity is being undermined by frequent changes in leadership.A high rate of turnover among senior executives and creative directors is creating instability and hindering the development of cohesive brand narratives. While these transitions might potentially be largely invisible to the average consumer, the effects are palpable. The period between creative director appointments can be particularly damaging. brands may lack a clear creative vision during this time, resulting in collections that feel uninspired or derivative. This lack of innovation further fuels consumer disillusionment. Consider the recent changes at brands like Gucci and Burberry; while intended to revitalize the brands, the transitions have created periods of uncertainty and impacted sales figures. A recent report by McKinsey indicated that brands experiencing creative leadership changes saw an average 5% dip in brand equity within the first year. Reorienting Towards Timelessness & Value In response to these challenges, many luxury brands are re-evaluating their strategies. Ther's a growing emphasis on timeless design and enduring quality, rather than fleeting trends. Brands are attempting to justify their price points by focusing on craftsmanship, heritage, and the longevity of their products. Though, simply emphasizing timelessness isn't enough. Brands must also demonstrate a commitment to innovation and creativity. This requires investing in design talent, exploring new materials and technologies, and fostering a culture of experimentation. Furthermore, brands need to be transparent about their pricing strategies and clearly communicate the value proposition of their products. The future of the luxury market hinges on its ability to reconnect with consumers, address their concerns, and deliver experiences that are both aspirational and meaningful. A return to genuine creativity, coupled with a renewed focus on value, will be crucial for navigating the current headwinds and securing long-term success. The Shifting Sands of Luxury: A market in Transition The global luxury market is undergoing a meaningful recalibration, marked by a complex interplay of economic headwinds and evolving consumer sentiment. A recent report by Bain & Company highlights a period of ‚Äúfar-reaching disruptions,‚Äù yet also acknowledges the industry's inherent resilience. However, simply relying on past successes won't suffice; luxury brands must adapt to a new landscape demanding sharper focus, cultural relevance, and purpose-driven growth. Profitability under Pressure: The Impact of Strategic Shifts A key trend reshaping the luxury sector is a intentional pullback from multi-brand retail platforms.Over 70% of luxury houses are reducing their volume through these channels, a move driven by factors like increased tariffs, decreased foot traffic in traditional retail spaces, and a slowdown in new product launches. While these decisions may initially impact overall revenue, the effect on profitability is disproportionately positive. ‚ÄúThese shifts have a noticeable impact on the topline,but an even greater one on the bottom line and EBIT,‚Äù explains federica levato,a partner at Bain. this suggests brands are prioritizing margin protection over sheer volume,focusing on channels where they have greater control over brand presentation and pricing. This strategy is particularly relevant given the current economic climate, where further price increases are becoming increasingly challenging to justify.For example, brands like Chanel and herm√®s have already implemented multiple price hikes in recent years, and further increases risk alienating even their most loyal customers...."

mov_DE151326715CCACD2E8C7ACA65AD8875,2025-06-20 04:02:43,it,WEB,"‚Äâ SPR_COMBO[it]Finalmente ci siamo, dopo qualche sbalzo d'umore climatico di troppo ad aumentare il desiderio, la stagione dei sandali pu√≤ dichiararsi ufficialmente iniziata: √® giunto il momento di prenotare quell'appuntamento per la pedicure e di aggiornare le proprie conoscenze in merito ai modelli attualmente sulla cresta dell'onda, anche se non necessariamente in questo ordine. Per il secondo proposito, nel frattempo, possiamo fare qualcosa noi. Sandali di tendenza per l'estate 2025: 5 modelli da cui lasciarsi conquistare In veste di grande classico dell'estate, i sandali, perfetti per completare i tanti outfit da spiaggia quanto quelli per il tempo libero, sono tornati ad imperare sullo scenario tendenze delle scarpe di stagione pi√π in forma che mai: una volta abbandonati quegli scenografici ma decisamente poco pratici tacchi scultorei insieme ai plateau, i modelli del 2025 abbracciano tacchi stiletto e solo qualche zeppa slim, con lacci e cinturini a brillare sul dorso del piede. Non mancano ovviamente le proposte ultra flat ad esaudire il dilagante bisogno di comfort, con le infradito come insospettabili protagoniste da indossare dal mattino alla sera senza sensi di colpa. A lanciarne di nuove e fiammanti, ma sempre minimal all'osso, sono stati il brand danese By Malene Birger, The Row e Max Mara, fornendo alle fashion addicted in preda alla disperazione un'inattesa opzione ad alto tasso di coolness quando fa troppo caldo per ergersi su tacchi vertiginosi. Proposte pi√π stravaganti e sperimentali, dal versante opposto, sono provenute da Maximilian Davis di Ferragamo, che ha impreziosito i suoi sandali infradito con frange color caramella su un tacco sferico in sughero. Grazie a Khaite e Balenciaga, invece, le fibbie approdano anche sulle calzature con anelli a D e morsetti argentati su varianti open toe. Dalla sua Herm√®s, marchio che ci ha sempre fortemente tentato dall'invenzione dell'Oran, nel 1997, ad oggi, si fa portavoce di un inedito diktat modaiolo: saranno gli zoccoli la scarpa favorita di ogni It-Girl nei mesi a venire, un'azzardata tacita dichiarazione fatta attraverso l'elegante proposta in tonalit√† moka. Insomma, i sandali simbolo dell'estate 2025 hanno qualcosa da offrire ad ogni tipologia di acquirente, dal fashion victim pi√π conservatore a quello sempre all'instancabile ricerca di novit√†. Pronti a scoprirli tutti? Sandali con cinturino Eleganti, versatili e sorprendentemente pratici i mitici sandali con cinturino sono tornati a prendere posto sullo scaffale in alto di ogni scarpiera anche se, forse, dopotutto, non hanno mai smesso di occuparlo. Parte fondamentale della controversa combo sandalo e calzino durante le mezze stagioni, questi si indossano volentieri perch√© tenuti ben saldi al piede dalle fibbie, le quali garantiscono aderenza mentre sostengono la camminata. Le evoluzioni del 2025 ne contemplano di classici e neri, di gusto minimalista e dall'eleganza senza tempo, come nel caso di The Row, ma anche modelli dal design bold perfetti per ricalibrare le mise da sera pi√π sobrie. Ferragamo, ad esempio, ha rivisitato i sandali con cinturino secondo i codici dell'estetica balletcore, portando alla sbarra le proprie modelle e vestendole per la primavera/estate con cardigan rosa antico e proposte accessoriate di spessi nastri in raso legati attorno alle caviglie. Altri, come Jimmy Choo, Burberry, Toteme e Proenza Schouler, lo hanno fatto invece attraverso sottili listini in pelle e corde ad abbracciare il piede su altezze diverse. Trovi qui i sandali con cinturino e t-bar di Patrizia Pepe Sandali cage Lontani parenti dei summenzionati, stanno letteralmente spopolando in questo principio d'estate i cosiddetti sandali cage, anch'essi caratterizzati da listini e intrecci e allo stesso modo sensuali ma con una caratteristica fondamentale che permette loro di distinguersi: una tomaia a ‚Äúgabbia‚Äù che tiene ben franco il piede nella falcata, persino quando lo scoglio da superare √® quello di tacchi a stiletto. A darne la propria personale interpretazione sono stati Giorgio Armani, Miu Miu, Tom Ford, Proenza Schouler e con loro tanti altri, completando in raffinatezza gli eleganti look scorsi in passerella. Un click per i sandali cage fucsia di Zara Mules e ciabattine Forse non saranno sensuali come un paio di altissimi tacchi, ma in compenso hanno dalla loro invidiabile comfort: mules e ciabattine con l'approdo della calda stagione tornano finalmente a popolare le citt√†, con la corrispondenza comodo ‚Äì ugly stravolta per sempre. S√¨, perch√© quest'anno le scarpe basse estive pi√π confortevoli in circolazione hanno deciso con coraggio di prendersi la loro rivincita, acquisendo una giusta dose di glamour. Come? Attraverso fibbie gioiello e design variopinti a rendere meno anonimi suole ergonomiche e materiali traspiranti. Le tanto amate quanto odiate Birkenstock, rinnovate nella forma, ad esempio, ora sanno coniugare alla perfezione la comodit√† dei plantari sagomati all'unicit√† della silhouette in un mix ben bilanciato. Con l'avvicinarsi dell'estate 2025 persino le infradito hanno subito un trattamento di alta moda: ci√≤ che ne √® uscito non assomiglia per niente alle antenate in gomma che noi tutti conosciamo. Carven ha dato vita ad un ibrido, simile ad una flip-flops sul davanti ma come una d√©collet√© bassa sul retro, mentre Ala√Øa ne ha accentuato il fattore eleganza disegnandole dotate di tacco in raso rosa. Leader nel campo delle calzature di gusto minimalista, The Row ha detto la propria in merito lanciando un'infradito di alta moda: dopo il successo delle Ginza ecco il nuovo design chiamato Dune, con plantare in gomma texturizzata e cinturino in grosgrain di cotone. Dopo il tramonto, poi, le ciabatte lasciano spazio a comodi tacchi a blocco che promettono di slanciare la silhouette e, al tempo stesso, garantire comfort a lunga durata. Da scegliere in nuance vitaminiche o in variante metallizzata, i tacchi bassi e squadrati uniscono eleganza e praticit√† in uno solo. Perfetti sotto a gonne midi e tailleur leggeri, si adattano benissimo anche a dress code pi√π formali per serate estive nel segno del buon gusto. Clicca qui per acquistare i sandali bassi con fibbie di Michael Kors Sandali flat Chi ha detto che si debba necessariamente soffrire per essere alla moda? A smentire questa antica ‚Äì e forse anche poco veritiera ‚Äì credenza ci pensano i sandali flat dell'estate 2025. Comodi e funzionali, secondo Isabel Marant, Tod's, Max Mara e Miu Miu la loro peculiarit√† √® quella di poter essere indossati con tutto e a tutte le ore del giorno. La tipica linea affusolata che li contraddistingue √® da ritenersi la controtendenza della moda chunky, che sta incontrando sempre meno plauso tra i fashionisti: ne sono un esempio le scarpe con le zeppe slim, le cage e i gladiator, modelli fedeli ad un'estetica sempre pi√π minimal e che predilige gli indispensabili per costruire un completo guardaroba capsula su cui costruire numerose possibilit√† di styling. Qui trovi i sandali flat di Ria Menorca Sandali gioiello Ogni passo diventa abbagliante con i sandali gioiello ai piedi: sono loro la calzatura imprescindibile dell'estate 2025, piccoli capolavori artigiani in grado di firmare ogni mise a colpi di cristalli e strass. Adatti a cerimonie e cene come anche a giornate in ufficio o a pomeriggi di shopping, poco importa che siano bassi oppure con il tacco, sotto forma di mules oppure infradito. Costellati di glitter, mini pepite dorate e fiori luccicanti, quelli odierni si indossano con qualsiasi cosa spostando il focus del look su piedi e caviglie; lo hanno dimostrato efficacemente in pedana Aquazurra, Roger Vivier e Amina Muaddi. Ti innamorerai di questi sandali gioiell..."

June 12 was a day of sorrow for many Indians, especially those whose family members and friends were on the flight or in the building that it crashed into. Javed Ali Syed and Dr Prateek Joshi died alongside their families. Photo credit: Daily Mail. Source: UGC The tragedy was so horrific that some families were all gone, a sorrowful example being Dr Prateek Joshi, his wife and their three children, who all perished. Legit.ng shares a list of five couples who were travelling together but all died in the Air India plane that crashed at Ahmedabad. 1. Javed Ali Syed, Mariam Syed, and their two children All the Syeds in the ill-fated Air India flight that crashed on June 12 lost their lives. They were four in number, including Javed Ali Syed, Mariam Syed, Zayn Ali Syed, 6, and Amani Ali Syed, 4. The husband, Javed Ali Syed, was a hotel manager at the Best Western Kensington Olympia Hotel, UK. Mariam, on the other hand, was the wife of Javed Ali Syed.

mov_6C5E3D3C530F8E20EE0F9EDF530E4F66,2025-06-21 06:45:00,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Those with a Stocks and Shares ISA will be familiar how it can be badly affected by uncontrollable events. In recent weeks, President Trump's erratic approach to tariffs has caused turmoil for global stock markets. And with so much uncertainty, it's hard to know who the winners and losers will be. That's why, at times like these, I think it's a good idea to try and spread risk over as many investments as possible . But that's easier said than done. For example, how many is the 'correct' number of stocks to own? A possible option   One way of achieving a diversified portfolio ‚Äî with the minimum of effort ‚Äî is to buy an investment trust. And I've found four that, between them, have positions in around 1,000 companies. I say 'approximately' because some of their investments are in other trusts, and information about how many stocks these own isn't readily available. Stock Net asset value (¬£bn) Market cap (¬£bn) Premium / (Discount) (%) Dividend yield (%) City of London Investment Trust 2.377 2.423 1.9 4.3 Alliance Witan 5.026 4.795 (4.6) 2.3 The Bankers Investment Trust 1.355 1.237 (8.7) 2.3 Caledonia Investments 2.937 2.000 (31.9) 2.0 Combined 11.695 10.455 ¬†(10.6) ¬†2.7 Source: Hargreaves Lansdown at close of business on 19 June and the London Stock Exchange   Importantly for those looking to diversify, the four own shares in businesses that operate in many different industries including IT, financial services, healthcare, real estate and utilities, across every continent. Many of the stocks are privately-owned, which means they are less affected by stock market volatility. Despite this, it's inevitable there will be some overlap. For example, Alliance Witan ( LSE:ALW ), Caledonia Investments and The Bankers Investment Trust all own Microsoft shares. And because these three trusts trade at a discount to their net asset value, they are ‚Äì on paper at least ‚Äî undervalued. However, it should be pointed out that discounts are common with these types of funds, especially ones that have a large exposure to unquoted companies. These holdings can be difficult to value as there isn't an active market for their shares. I also think it's worth noting that the four share an impressive record of increasing their dividends for 58 consecutive years! Top of the shop   The largest on the list is Alliance Witan. Following a merger with a rival in 2024, it became a member of the FTSE 100 . The trust has a simple investment objective, which is to achieve long-term capital and income growth. At 31 May, it held 229 stocks with a market-cap of ¬£4.7bn. Its three biggest holdings were Microsoft, Amazon and Visa . Some investment trusts can have relatively high levels of debt which makes them vulnerable to rising borrowing costs. But Alliance Witan's gross gearing was only 8.4% at the end of 2024. Its target is 7.5-12.5%. Over the past eight years or so, it's delivered a healthy return. From 1 April 2017 to 31 May, its share price increased by 105.6%. During the five years to the end of May, it went up 76.3%. However, because it mainly invests in global equities it's not immune from stock market volatility. And over the past five years, the trust's been marginally outperformed by the MSCI ACWI index, the benchmark against which it measures itself. But with over 200 positions in 11 sectors, spread across four continents, it's well diversified. On this basis, I think Alliance Witan's a stock that those looking to follow a risk-averse strategy could consider. As for the other three, I'd have to do more research before deciding whether to part with my cash but, in principle, I believe investment trusts are an excellent way of spreading risk.

Email tips@dailymail.com Jodie Turner-Smith¬†looked as stylish as ever as she stepped out in Manhattan's SoHo with her best friend Nancy Gomez on Friday. The British actress, 38, put on a leggy display in a pair of denim shorts and a fitted black T-shirt. She kept comfortable in a pair of flat, black ballet pumps and she¬†completed her outfit with a large, yellow Burberry shoulder bag. Meanwhile, photographer Nancy cut an equally casual figure in an oversized white T-shirt. She completed the look with a pair of black sunglasses and a baseball cap and they appeared in excellent spirits as they headed out for a stroll. The friends are often seen together and they are so close¬†that Jodie joked about them 'never beating the lesbian allegations' on social media in May. She had shared a playful picture of them sharing a kiss with Jodie captioning her cheeky words, with Nancy responding:¬†'Like ever lol.' Their jovial outing comes after a difficult time amid¬†Jodie's bitter custody battle with her ex-husband¬†Joshua Jackson, 46, over their five-year-old daughter Juno. Relations between the pair took a further downward turn earlier this month when she appeared to compare him to a Disney villain. Jodie and the Dawson's Creek star split in October 2023 citing 'irreconcilable differences' reportedly caused by their busy work schedules - after first sparking up a romance in 2018 and welcoming daughter Juno, now five. The Queen & Slim actress took to Instagram earlier this month to share a cryptic post showing an array of Disney villains, who at first appeared nice. The post read: 'Why don't you like that person? They seem so nice. You know who else seemed to be nice?' with Jodie adding the caption 'stay safe out there ' The post came after Joshua filed a motion and request for an emergency custody order modification, according to court documents obtained by E! News. In the motion, filed on May 30, he claimed Jodie changed their five-year-old daughter's school for kindergarten without his permission. He claimed she selected an establishment that was outside of the 45-minute commute time from his home that they had previously agreed upon. He requested that Juno remains at her current school where she is 'flourishing' and is seeking joint consent with her ex-wife over any decisions regarding her education. DailyMail.com reached out to reps for both Joshua and Jodie at the time but did not immediately hear back."

Este plan de viajero frecuente, creado en 2005 tras la fusi√≥n de Fr√©quence Plus de Air France y Flying Dutchman de KLM, cuenta con casi 30 millones de miembros en todo el mundo. El club fue creado para los clientes de las aerol√≠neas Air France, KLM y Aircalin, pero con los a√±os se incorporaron TAROM en 2010, y Transavia, en 2013. Actualmente, el sistema de beneficios abarca a m√°s de 40 aerol√≠neas y m√°s de 100 socios comerciales, lo que permite acumular y canjear millas tanto al volar como en el d√≠a a d√≠a. TE PUEDE INTERESAR: Incorporan zapatillas: SKY present√≥ su nuevo uniforme de tripulaci√≥n Recientemente, Flying Blue fue distinguido como ""Mejor Programa de Recompensas de Aerol√≠neas del Mundo"" por el especialista en programas de fidelizaci√≥n Point.me, y como ‚ÄúMejor Programa Elite en Europa y √Åfrica‚Äù por los premios Freddie Awards. Para conmemorar este aniversario, el grupo lanz√≥ la campa√±a ""Convirtiendo Millas en Recuerdos, desde hace 20 a√±os"". Esta iniciativa tiene como objetivo mostrar la evoluci√≥n del programa y los recuerdos de viajes creados a lo largo de los a√±os. Es por esto que desde el 6 de junio la campa√±a est√° presente en los aeropuertos de Par√≠s-Charles de Gaulle, Par√≠s-Orly, √Åmsterdam Schiphol y Nueva York JFK. Adem√°s, se ha difundido en las redes sociales de Air France KLM y Flying Blue, incluyendo Facebook, Instagram y Spotify. Adicionalmente, se lanz√≥ una promoci√≥n especial denominada como ""Millas Recuerdos"". Con esta oferta, brindar√°n a ciertos afortunados miembros de m√°s de 30 pa√≠ses la oportunidad de volver a visitar destinos ic√≥nicos de la red en la que opera el grupo. Flying Blue se convirti√≥ en un programa de fidelizaci√≥n completo A lo largo de su historia, el programa ha lanzado una serie de productos y servicios como la tarjeta cobranding con American Express. Tambi√©n ofrece una opci√≥n de arriendo de autos con Hertz, as√≠ como innovaciones como Cash & Miles, entre otros. En 2022, se incorpor√≥ la funci√≥n Flying Blue Family, que permite a los miembros de una familia agrupar sus millas. Adem√°s, entre 2023 y 2025 se han establecido nuevas alianzas con empresas como Amazon, Uber, Hertz y la operadora ferroviaria nacional francesa SNCF. Con el objetivo de multiplicar las oportunidades de acumular millas, el club ha evolucionado hasta convertirse en un programa de fidelizaci√≥n integral, ya que no limita el uso ni la acumulaci√≥n de beneficios exclusivamente al √°mbito de los viajes. Otra de las novedades es el lanzamiento de la nueva aplicaci√≥n m√≥vil Flying Blue+ con la que el programa contin√∫a en transformaci√≥n. Esta plataforma, por el momento disponible en Reino Unido y Estados Unidos, permite a los usuarios ganar millas en sus compras en tiendas como Macy's, Burberry y Apple. Asimismo, los socios tienen la posibilidad de donar sus recompensas a ONG's como Cruz Roja, UNICEF y The Ocean Cleanup. El grupo inform√≥ que, en 2024, los miembros del programa entregaron 450 millones de millas para apoyar las operaciones y misiones de estas entidades."

80690BAB5EA4EFEE9DB3672110F50F35,2025-06-23 07:15:59,en,PRINT,"‚Äâ Now that we're all back in the office, I'm wondering how to navigate work wear this summer. The office is ''business causal,'' and people wear anything from a suit to jeans and a T-shirt, but what I don't see is shorts. Why not? Are they really that different than a skirt? Caitlin, Washington, D.C.   To give you a ... well, short answer: not at all. Shorts are often longer than skirts these days and often more conservative. There is no reason a woman shouldn't wear them to the office. It's a little more complicated for men, even considering the success of Thom Browne, because of our more complicated feelings about men's legs. But that's a whole different story. If there's any hesitancy about women, work and shorts, I think it comes from our deep-seated associations with the garment, which generally have to do with summer, weekends and childhood. Shorts are what we wear when we aren't at work, so it can seem uncomfortable, or even subversive, to wear them in the office. In our psychographic wardrobe, they represent leisure, and sports. Opting to wear them in a professional capacity for anyone who isn't an athlete is as much a mental choice as a fashion decision. Which may be why they seem to be the last frontier of dress code revisionism. In practical terms, however, there is no reason not to wear shorts to work -- or at least a certain style of shorts. As with any garment, it's the kind of shorts you wear that matter and how you dress them up. Very short shorts, no matter how tailored or office appropriate the fabric, should be avoided, just like very short skirts. So should rompers. (No one will take you seriously in something called a romper.) Instead, opt for shorts that reach almost to the knees or fall below the knee. Not to mention Bermuda shorts or walking shorts. Then, said the stylist Karla Welch when I asked for her recommendations, add a T-shirt (tucked in and belted), a blazer and ''conservative shoes'': platform loafers, say, or kitten heels or even pumps. Another option: an oversize button-up shirt. Shorts add a bit of surprise, and cool, to what could otherwise be a fairly staid look, transforming the stiffness of a suit into business casual almost by definition. Also, they make walking a lot easier. And in a heat wave, they are just more comfortable to wear. The good news is, fashion has been pushing exactly these kinds of shorts for a few seasons now, with Burberry, Dries Van Noten, Emilia Wickstead and Victoria Beckham embracing the idea most recently. Still, the fact that it has taken such repetition, and that this question keeps coming up every summer, reflects the ambivalence many consumers feel about office shorts. It may be time to give them a new name to reflect their new status, a sort of portmanteau of pants and shorts, though no combination of those words trips off the tongue. (Try it. You'll see what I mean.) Still, the more we see the whatever-you-want-to-call-them, the easier it becomes to imagine wearing them off the catwalk and into the conference room. Someone has to be first. Why shouldn't it be you?Every week in the Open Thread newsletter, The Times's chief fashion critic, Vanessa Friedman, answers a reader's fashion-related question.

Shorts are often longer than skirts these days and often more conservative. There is no reason a woman shouldn't wear them to the office. It's a little more complicated for men, even considering the success of Thom Browne, because of our more complicated feelings about men's legs. But that's a whole different story. If there's any hesitancy about women, work and shorts, I think it comes from our deep-seated associations with the garment, which generally have to do with summer, weekends and childhood. Shorts are what we wear when we aren't at work, so it can seem uncomfortable, or even subversive, to wear them in the office. In our psychographic wardrobe, they represent leisure, and sports. Opting to wear them in a professional capacity for anyone who isn't an athlete is as much a mental choice as a fashion decision. Which may be why they seem to be the last frontier of dress code revisionism. We've abandoned the tie, accepted the hoodie, but shorts ‚Ä¶ well. The jury is still out. In practical terms, however, there is no reason not to wear shorts to work ‚Äî or at least a certain style of shorts. As with any garment, it's the kind of shorts you wear that matter and how you dress them up. Very short shorts, no matter how tailored or office appropriate the fabric, should be avoided, just like very short skirts. So should rompers. (No one will take you seriously in something called a romper.) So should anything resembling bike shorts. Demi Moore wore them once with a brocade skirt to the Oscars, but the resulting derision is all you really need to remember about that. Instead, opt for shorts that reach almost to the knees or fall below the knee, so they have more in common with their sartorial ancestor, short pants (or at least capri pants), than, say, underwear. Not to mention Bermuda shorts or walking shorts. Then, said the stylist Karla Welch when I asked for her recommendations, add a T-shirt (tucked in and belted), a blazer and ‚Äúconservative shoes‚Äù: platform loafers, say, or kitten heels or even pumps. Another option: an oversize button-up shirt. Shorts add a bit of surprise, and cool, to what could otherwise be a fairly staid look, transforming the stiffness of a suit into business casual almost by definition. Also, they make walking, not to mention reaching for anything on a high shelf, a lot easier. And in a heat wave, they are just more comfortable to wear. The good news is, fashion has been pushing exactly these kinds of shorts for a few seasons now, with Burberry, Dries Van Noten, Emilia Wickstead and Victoria Beckham embracing the idea most recently. Still, the fact that it has taken such repetition, and that this question keeps coming up every summer, reflects the ambivalence many consumers feel about office shorts. It may be time to give them a new name to reflect their new status, a sort of portmanteau of pants and shorts, though no combination of those words trips off the tongue. (Try it. You'll see what I mean.) Still, the more we see the whatever-you-want-to-call-them, the easier it becomes to imagine wearing them off the catwalk and into the conference room.

Sempre impeccabilmente vestita, la publisher di Calvin Klein divenne un nome noto alla stampa quando inizi√≤ a frequentare John F. Kennedy Jr. nel 1994. Due anni dopo, la coppia si sposava sull'isola remota di Cumberland, nello stato americano della Georgia. La sposa indossava un abito di seta realizzato da Narciso Rodriguez e sandali di perline firmati Manolo Blahnik, una mise che comparve sulle prime pagine di tutti i quotidiani del mondo. Negli anni che seguirono, fu il suo stile street style dall'appeal naturalmente cool a rubare la scena. Viso acqua e sapone e capelli al naturale, divenne l'immagine simbolo del minimalismo anni '90 ispirando anche quella che √® l'attuale uniforme di molte editor di moda: leggi capi sobri e raffinati dall'eleganza intramontabile. Leggi anche: Carolyn Bessette e John Kennedy Jr, arriva la serie tv sulla loro tragica love story: ecco le prime foto Nonostante la vita di Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy sia stata oscurata dalla sua tragica morte in un incidente aereo nel 1999, il suo stile indimenticabile continua a vivere. √à comparsa nelle moodboard degli stilisti durante gli scorsi trent'anni e negli ultimi mesi l'interesse del mondo della moda nei suoi confronti non ha fatto che aumentare. Musa di Calvin Klein, Bessette-Kennedy riempiva il guardaroba di capi Prada, Helmut Lang, Jil Sander e Yohji Yamamoto ( cui era particolarmente affezionata, e che dava al suo stile elegante un tocco d'avanguardia). Questo non significa che fosse del tutto inaccessibile ‚Äì era fedele ai Levi's 517 ‚Äì ma supporre che il suo stile possa essere replicato senza sforzo sarebbe un errore. Se il look di Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy √® nello vostre corde, ecco le nove tendenze base che hanno definito il suo inconfondibile stile #1 Sandali effetto nudo La scarpa must √® quella tanto amata da Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy: stiamo parlando del sandalo a listini con tacco midi molto minimal. Abbinati a jeans dal taglio crop e canotta, questi sandali diventano immediatamente sinonimo di uno stile easy e nonchalant. Marco Tozzi #2 Il cerchietto Prada potr√† anche aver reintrodotto il cerchietto-fascia in satin di seta ma Bessette-Kennedy fu una delle prime a promuoverne la moda, abbinando abitualmente un ampio cerchietto tartaruga Charles J. Wahba con occhiali da sole dalla montatura ovale e T-shirt bianca, sia con un abito Miu Miu e stivali Prada, sia con i suoi Levi's. Si sono viste molte versioni rigide e strutturate del cerchietto da Simone Rocha, Alexandre de Paris e Lele Sadoughi, il che dimostra che questo accessorio bon-ton che arriva direttamente dall'infanzia si adatta benissimo a essere reinterpretato in versione New York street style, e Quiet Luxury. Righe e Pois #3 La camicia bianca sartoriale Quando si tratta di elevare un capo classico, sono in poche le donne in grado di competere con Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy. Per una cena di gala al Whitney Museum of American Art, trasform√≤ una camicia bianca in un capo eveningwear, semplicemente sbottonandola fino allo sterno, arrotolandone le maniche e abbinandola a una maxi gonna a balze. Accessoriato con sandali neri e borsetta di perline color oro, il look era l'epitome di un glamour ricercato ma assolutamente discreto. John F. Kennedy Jr. e Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, New York, 1999 (Photo by Arnaldo Magnani/Liaison) #4 L'abito sottoveste Gli abiti sottoveste con taglio di sbieco erano il capo chiave del guardaroba di Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy: dall'abito di nozze firmato Narciso Rodriguez ai minidress neri che era solita indossare durante le afose estati in citt√†, passando per le versioni grigie a coste abbinate allo spolverino per le giornate pi√π fresche. Dopo il boom degli anni 90, e il revival degli ultimi anni sulle passerelle, lo slip dress √® diventato un capo intramontabile. #5 Beige e nero Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy amava l'accostamento beige e nero in tutte le sue forme: dalla gonna a matita color cammello con pullover nero e stivali marroni, alla T-shirt con pantaloni color kakhi e mocassini fino ai pantaloni di velluto a coste nei toni caramello abbinati al dolcevita nero. Un buon punto di riferimento per questo abbinamemto cromatico √® Burberry, a partire dal suo iconico check. #6 La bandana foulard Proprio come la suocera Jacqueline Kennedy, che era solita raccogliere i capelli sotto un foulard di seta durante le vacanze a Capri, Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy aveva la passione per la bandane foulard color block. Abbinata a un paio di jeans, canotta e blazer fa molto ""chic"" Costa Azzurra, ma in versione moderna. Karl Loven #7 L'abito midi floreale Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy sapeva certamente come iniettare una sferzata di brio al tipico abito floreale estivo: vedi tacchi a spillo, capelli sensualmente in disordine e borsa Prada nera dal finish glossy per un look che mixa eleganza e naturalezza. #8 Il total black Bessette-Kennedy aveva un debole per i look completamente neri, soprattutto quando si trattava di abiti da cerimonia. Ha mostrato un'ampia gamma di capi, dai tailleur con gonna che le stringevano la vita agli affascinanti due pezzi off-the-shoulder, firmati Yohji Yamamoto, Jean Paul Gaultier, Alexander McQueen. Da indossare con sandali neri con cinturino, guanti da opera in velluto nero, d√©collet√© a punta, e abbinare a un beauty look con labbra scarlatte e chignon elegante.

mov_5A6ED8D9FF0C3357EB9CC2A0B145CF2B,2025-06-23 16:30:05,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Law Roach is so booked and busy, he must have the power to bend space and time. The celebrity stylist and self-described ‚Äúimage architect‚Äù is constantly adding to his r√©sum√© and A-list clientele. This year at the Met Gala alone, he dressed six luminaries ‚Äî Zendaya, Jeremy Pope, Angela Bassett, Cardi B, Andr√© 3000, and Tyla ‚Äî and consulted on styling choices for the Burberry table at the annual fundraiser for the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costume Institute. On top of his stylist work, Roach has made a name in the television world as a judge on reality show competitions like RuPaul's Drag Race and HBO's ballroom show, Legendary. As if he's not busy enough, the celebrity stylist was announced as a judge on season 21 of Project Runway, which is set to premiere July 31 on Disney+, Freeform, and Hulu. It is fitting that one of Hollywood's premier fashion consultants is now a judge on a show centered around finding the next prominent designer ‚Äî alongside Heidi Klum, Christian Siriano, and Elle's editor in chief, Nina Garcia. Aside from forming a tight-knit friendship with Siriano and working with Garcia professionally, Roach says he was excited about the opportunity to join the seasoned fashion veterans. Nina Garcia and Law Roach are judges on Project Runway season 21Disney/Spencer Pazer ‚ÄúIt just felt like the right time to enter a space that felt really familiar because I grew up watching that show,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúI remember watching Christian's season when he won, so it felt like a full-circle moment to be invited to be a judge.‚Äù Being a stylist is what makes Roach a captivating judge on these panels. But it's not only his impeccable eye for beauty that makes him a fan favorite; he's also funny. His critiques aren't crass or shiftless, and they come with his signature charm. ‚ÄúWhen I'm on television, I get to show a small part of myself that is quick-witted and sassy, things I don't do in my professional life,‚Äù Roach says. ‚ÄúThis gives me a chance to be expressive in a different way.‚Äù Whether it's critiquing on Project Runway or Drag Race, his approach is the same. ‚ÄúRuPaul's Drag Race is a talent show that includes fashion, and Project Runway is a fashion show with great talent,‚Äù the stylist explains. ‚ÄúWhat makes me excited about Project Runway is that I'm looking at the next generation of Michael Kors and Marc Jacobs and being able to meet those talents at the ground level.‚Äù The foundation of his career, he says, was built on working with newer talent and emerging brands, so getting to share his experiences and give real-world advice is something he's proud to do. EASTON SCHIRRA The connections Roach has formed over the past decade of working in the fashion industry are why he cut his retirement short. In March 2023, the image architect announced in an Instagram post that he had retired from styling. But at the 2025 Fashion Trust Awards in April, Roach revealed he was making his foray back into styling with his new muse, actress Ryan Destiny. He's spoken in various media appearances about his focus on working with his two main clients, Zendaya and Dion. But it was his love for fashion that brought him back to the styling world. ‚ÄúI just had so much FOMO seeing these beautiful new collections by designers that I call my friends,‚Äù Roach explains. Not being able to touch, see, or use the clothes outside the fashion shows made him feel like he wasn't living up to his true potential, using his ‚Äúonly God-given talent.‚Äù With an achievement list as long as his, it's hard to wonder what else Roach is striving for ‚Äî but he says there's still much more he wants to do. One of his biggest goals is doing more scripted television. Earlier this year, he had a cameo as himself in the Kate Hudson Netflix series Running Point, and he says he wants to continue flexing that muscle. As for future celebrity clients, Roach believes the universe determines which people and opportunities come into his life and when, so there's no point in forcing anything. ‚ÄúEverything happens organically, and I hope to keep it that way.‚Äù This article is part of Out's July/Aug 2025 issue, which hits newsstands July 1.

mov_8CF9F8E8C0E52C5CCDC6CFF714B3F646,2025-06-23 17:45:04,it,WEB,"‚Äâ SPR_COMBO[it]Tra un discorso sui costumi di tendenza e un occhio allo stile da sfoggiare nell'agognata meta delle nostre ferie sono spuntate alcune - insospettabili - icone di stile in questo torrido inizio estate. Non sono quelle che ci aspetteremmo (leggi: non c'√® l'ultima influencer che condivide reel delle sue esotiche vacanze), ma vengono dalla musica, dal mondo dei Millennial o direttamente dai lontani anni Novanta. Passiamo in rassegna le loro identit√† e perch√© se ne parla (di nuovo).¬† Lana Del Rey La regina dell'amore perduto, delle emozioni e della malinconia ha raggiunto il traguardo dei quaranta qualche giorno fa, e tanto √® bastato per far tornare alla ribalta tutti i suoi look cupi, romantici e hollywoodiani (perch√© in fatto di stile c'√® solo l'imbarazzo della scelta). Dall'estetica anni Sessanta liberamente ispirata a Priscilla Presley, con eyeliner pesante e capelli cotonati, al mood boho chic che ha contribuito a formare la classica Coachella aesthetic, passando per lo stile American Girl con stivali, paillettes e minidress degli Yankees. Senza dimenticare l'era dark: dal Met Gala del 2018 (Heavenly Bodies, finora il tema pi√π spettacolare mai realizzato), dopo il quale tutte noi cominciammo a sfoggiare croci al limite della blasfemia agli ultimi look da concerto come quello, meraviglioso, di pizzo total black firmato Dolce&Gabbana. Insomma, da pi√π di 10 anni √® nata una stella, complice anche l'amicizia con Alessandro Michele, con il quale il sodalizio era quasi scontato: quell'aura vintage che all'ultimo Met Gala si √® tramutata in un outfit da diva di Hollywood dei tempi che furono con maxi fiocco e acconciatura retr√≤. Ma non serve la gran serata: pensiamo a Lana ogni volta che indossiamo un abitino a fiori vintage. Questo fanno le icone, sono sempre nella nostra mente nonch√© nel nostro guardaroba.¬† Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy Sono passati 26 anni dall'incidente in cui ha perso la vita insieme al marito John F. Kennedy junior: e allora, vi chiederete voi, perch√© il nostro Instagram √® invaso dalle foto del suoi look minimal? Due motivi: lo stile di Carolyn, imitatissimo negli anni Novanta, √® tornato in auge con il ritorno del mood minimal, ma soprattutto perch√© sono partite le riprese di American Love Story, una serie sulla favola (finita in tragedia) della pubblicitaria di New York che si innamor√≤ del rampollo della famiglia pi√π famosa degli Stati Uniti. I due saranno interpretati da Paul Kelly e Sarah Pidgeon ma non appena sono uscite le prime foto la serie √® stata sommersa dalle critiche, soprattutto per i look di lei che, citiamo i commenti su Instagram, sembrano usciti direttamente dall'ultimo negozio di fast fashion del centro commerciale. Un paradosso per un'icona di stile che √® stata musa di Calvin Klein e vestiva notoriamente Prada, Helmut Lang e Yohji Yamamoto. Il suo abito da sposa? Narciso Rodriguez. Ma se il suo stile √® nelle vostre corde, non spaventatevi perch√©¬†Carolyn indossava spesso e volentieri semplici Levi's 501, giacche di pelle dal taglio semplice e anche le All Star: tutto incredibilmente attuale.¬† Alexa Chung Altra icona del minimalismo, ma con un twist estroso: Alexa Chung √® tornata, direttamente dagli anni dell'Indie rock in cui si accompagnava a cantanti del calibro di Alex Turner (e se non avete mai letto la lettera d'amore che lui le scrisse recuperatela subito, non ve ne pentirete). Per noi Millennial era LA ragazza da imitare, anche perch√© i suoi look erano tutto sommato replicabili, l'importante era il mood: gli shorts di jeans, il Barbour, gli stivali infangati a Glastonbury. Chi ama il genere la ha sempre seguita, ma ultimamente sta tornando alla ribalta: ne abbiamo parlato per la partecipazione alla nuova campagna Burberry, e ne parliamo ancora per alcune foto della sua ultima vacanza italiana. Poesia: la bandana e gli short shorts must dell'estate (e lei a 40 anni li indossa benissimo), l'abito bianco di pizzo con il cardigan, il costume rosso con la camicia aperta. Gi√† tutto salvato nella nostra cartella ""Outfit per le vacanze"".¬† ¬© RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA"

e799c2b8e272eadb3ae76bbc429c9dde,2025-06-24 04:03:00,en,WEB,"‚Äâ This week, I checked in on the burgeoning beauty supplement category. Additionally, Unilever is set to acquire men's personal care leader Dr. Squatch, there's another exec shakeup at Violet Grey, and Beautycounter founder Gregg Renfrew is back with Counter. The beauty supplement marketplace is expanding again Part of this growth is driven by consumer behavior formed during the Covid-19 pandemic. ‚ÄúIn 2019, retail sales were at $26.2 billion [for vitamins and supplements], but as the pandemic pushed health and immunity into the spotlight, the market surged by 22.1% to reach $32 billion in 2020,‚Äù David Hamlette, health and wellness research analyst at Mintel market research company, told Glossy. ‚ÄúThis initial boom continued into 2021, with sales climbing to $34.8 billion. However, as pandemic-related concerns began to ease, so did the rapid growth.‚Äù The market slowed significantly in 2022, up just 0.6%, followed by 3.5% growth in 2023 to reach $36.2 billion. Growth in 2024 is estimated to have been around 3.2%. ‚ÄúWhile the explosive growth of the early pandemic period has tapered off, the category has now stabilized and continues to see a gradual, sustainable rise,‚Äù Hamlette said. ‚ÄúThe good news is that consumer interest in health and wellness remains strong.‚Äù For some brands, reaching this evolving supplement consumer means adding beauty benefits into the mix. The beauty supplement category has traditionally included vitamins and drink mixes benefitting the hair, skin and nails but has more recently grown to include supplements targeting cellular health, the microbiome and gut, all of which impact our outward appearance. ‚ÄúBeauty and wellness is collapsing in on each other,‚Äù Henry Davis, CEO of Sakara Life, told Glossy. ‚ÄúIt is an artificial divide that retailers have put in place.‚Äù Davis ‚Äî who led Glossier as president and COO from 2014 to 2018 and joined meal delivery company Sakara in 2023 ‚Äî has big ambitions for the beauty category. On Monday the company launched Beauty Biome, a $65 daily capsule supplement that targets gut health for healthier skin, at the retailer Credo. ‚ÄúOver 90% of our clients have been asking us for supplements and over 75% have been asking us for beauty [offerings],‚Äù Davis said. Sakara debuted its supplement line in February with offerings that target cell health, sleep and metabolism. But Beauty Biome, and its distribution through Credo, is a more direct leap into beauty. ‚ÄúWe're very focused on an all-body [approach], and the biggest organ in your body is skin, so that's something we're obviously very focused on and interested in,‚Äù Davis said. ‚ÄúIt's a very natural and obvious opportunity for us to do more [in beauty], and Beauty Biome is our step in that direction. [We're] really trying to collapse these categories in on each other and be the people that tell that story.‚Äù But the merging of beauty and wellness isn't necessarily new. For example, L'Or√©al-backed Timeline, a Swiss company launched in 2020 and known for a proprietary molecule said to increase cell longevity through ingestibles, launched a line of moisturizers called Timeline Skin Health in 2023 to complement its oral supplements. A representative for the brand told Glossy that Timeline has seen high double-digit growth so far this year. That's partially been driven by its newest launch, The Eye Cream, which retails DTC for $150 and is powered by the same anti-aging compound found in its vitamins. According to Mintel market research company, just under half of supplement users surveyed this year have also taken a beauty supplement. However, the majority of beauty supplement consumers surveyed agree that regular health supplements are just as effective in maintaining their appearance. ‚ÄúBeauty supplements are currently perceived as a 'nice-to-have.' ‚Ä¶ To establish itself as a 'must-have', the category will need to advance science-backed messaging and demonstrate proven effectiveness,‚Äù Joan Li, beauty and personal care senior analyst at Mintel, told Glossy. ‚ÄúHigh-income adults, particularly those aged 55 and older, are showing a growing interest in products designed to promote anti-aging benefits, improve skin firmness and boost elasticity,‚Äù said Mintel's Hamlette. Many oral vitamin brands have also expanded the beauty supplement category. For example, MaryRuth Organics, a liquid vitamin line launched in 2014, entered the beauty supplement space in 2022 with a biotin hair gummy followed by a $75 sugar-free liquid vitamin for hair health the next year. The latter is currently a bestseller, and in April, the company expanded the line to include new flavors. This offering has been clinically tested to improve hair growth and reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Collaborations and partnerships have also been category drivers. For example, Skin Laundry, the laser facial provider, and Nutrafol, the beauty supplement brand backed by Unilever, just announced a new partnership to promote an inside-outside acne treatment protocol. It includes a recommendation for laser treatments and oral supplements. The campaign, which will run through August, includes special promotions for brand clients who patronize the partnering brand. As previously reported by Glossy , vitamin therapy was first used in Western medicine in the early 1900s to treat issues like rickets or scurvy, but it wasn't until the 1970s that vitamins gained mass popularity. The category is projected to reach $239 billion by 2028, according to Research and Markets . Executive moves: Tracy Kline is the new group president of specialty beauty retailer and content site Violet Grey. Her CV includes nine years at Macy's-owned Bluemercury, most recently as its head of merchandising and spa. Byredo founder Ben Gorham is leaving the brand. Gorham founded the luxury fragrance brand in 2006 and sold it to Spanish beauty conglomerate Puig in 2022. Luca de Meo is the new CEO of Gucci-owner Kering. He previously served as CEO of carmaker Renault Group. Fran√ßois-Henri Pinault previously held the CEO role at Kering and will stay on as chairman of the board of directors...."

As the global landscape continues to evolve, British businesses are showing a remarkable ability to adapt to both opportunities and challenges, ensuring the UK business news cycle remains dynamic and highly relevant. One of the most significant trends shaping the Business News in UK is the sustained growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), particularly in the tech and green energy sectors. These industries are at the forefront of driving employment, attracting investment, and fueling regional development. Recent data shows that startups in Manchester, Leeds, and Glasgow are outperforming their pre-pandemic revenue projections, drawing attention from international investors and venture capital firms. Meanwhile, the Bank of England's latest interest rate decisions have been a central focus in the UK Times Business News. In response to easing inflation, the Bank has hinted at a possible rate cut, which could offer relief to mortgage holders and stimulate spending. However, business leaders remain cautious, weighing potential benefits against ongoing uncertainty in the global supply chain and energy markets. Retail has also made a strong comeback, especially in the e-commerce and luxury sectors.

Despite the cost-of-living crisis, UK consumers are showing a willingness to spend on premium experiences and products, signaling a shift in post-pandemic buying behavior. Another critical area featured prominently in the business news in UK is the government's evolving stance on international trade. The post-Brexit environment has prompted renewed negotiations with both EU and non-EU countries. Trade deals with India, Australia, and members of the CPTPP (Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership) are being seen as vital pathways to diversify exports and reduce dependence on European markets.

In the finance sector, the UK business news has been closely following the performance of the London Stock Exchange and the fluctuating value of the British pound. Investor confidence has remained relatively stable, though analysts urge caution due to geopolitical tensions and macroeconomic risks that could impact future growth. As we head into the second half of 2025, the business news in UK is expected to be shaped by key developments in digital transformation, artificial intelligence, and workplace innovation.

mov_953807745A614F491AFB262406D7DF91,2025-06-24 12:11:37,en,WEB,"‚Äâ You could argue that the first half of this year has been a particularly fashionable one for Jason Isaacs. In February, Burberry's creative director Daniel Lee cast the 61-year-old actor for his first modelling gig. Much like his recent role in The White Lotus Now, he's receiving guest invites instead of show day call sheets, having tail-ended a family trip to Tuscany with the Giorgio Armani show in Milan. ""I say I'm on holiday, but I'm basically chauffeuring my children and their boys, friends, girlfriends around to different towns and restaurants, "" he says to me over video call, before he slips into a GA linen suit to sit front row. ""So I left my chauffeuring duties for a day to come here."" It's fair to say that Isaacs is having a moment. He's had plenty of them before ‚Äì thanks to iconic roles in The Harry Potter franchise, Netflix's The OA and much more besides ‚Äì but he was caught up in the zeitgeist this year with his depiction of Timothy Ratcliff, the big-shot patriarch who leans on Lorazepam during his fraught stay at The White Lotus's Thai outpost. Then came The Salt Path, an independent film that adapted Raynor Winn's book of the same name, telling the story of a couple who take a 630-mile trek along the Cornish coast. It grossed ¬£1.4 million upon its opening weekend, and has outperformed Mission: Impossible ‚Äì The Final Reckoning ""It's been a very heartening reminder that when you tell great stories, it doesn't matter whether you have stunts or giant budgets, ""says Isaacs. ""In the end, we must hold human stories. With his fashion expertise growing, Esquire asked Isaacs about his sense of style, holiday dressing, and what it was like to walk the runway with Naomi Campbell. This interview has been edited for length and clarity As you've come from a holiday, what are some essentials that you always pack? I'm a tennis player, so I pack a tennis racket, and I pack things that I can play tennis in like tennis shoes and shorts, tops. Hopefully that will not hang heavily on me. Always pack two pairs of swimming trunks, because one will be wet and you might want to wear the other one. But it doesn't really matter, because my girls steal everything. My daughters steal my underwear and T shirts, and all of those baggy clothes. That's the sign of a fashionable wardrobe I do [have that] now, funnily enough. Since The White Lotus, I've been gifted so many things. I had a relatively empty wardrobe before, and now I have a wardrobe packed full of these fabulous suits and clothes. And my wife loves the transformation and begs me to keep dressing like this. But when we lived in California, she rightly identified that I liked living there because I wanted to dress like a skateboarder until I died. I was a professional skateboarder when I was 14 and 15, and I've never quite grown out of that. So this is the new incarnation for me. I don't know if it'll stick. I now have a bunch of lovely suits I feel very uncomfortable wearing them. I'm aware that one looks better wearing them, but my ideal clothes are Covid clothes: sweatpants and an old t-shirt. What's a film you think is really stylish? A film that comes to mind is Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris, because it was all about Dior and fashion. But I'm in that so it's likely too vain, possibly. I love The Godfather, that era of clothes and those extraordinary suits. They conjure up a sense of manhood and asylum people want. Even the casual clothes when Michael goes to Sicily, and those baggy suits! There's something about the men of that era, the hats and the mob clothes and how they embraced clothes that they couldn't wear during the war, the shapes of them that haven't really come back in, despite [fashion] being cyclical. I can't think of a time when men have looked like they looked in the forties. Are costumes vital in helping you to get into character? No more me than all actors. I mean, that's one of the tools you have to tell the audience in some visual shorthand about where you come from. One of the reasons I'm here [attending the Giorgio Armani show] is that I was in The White Lotus, I'm sure. You knew so much about those characters by what they wore. Alex [Bovaird] did the costumes and they told the audience so clearly and so specifically what world these characters came from. She does it so brilliantly that she's continually getting Emmy nominations for it. You almost didn't need to get to know where they're from, you could tell what they were like from what they were wearing on the boat [in the first episode]. You make assumptions that's then subverted by Mike White's brilliant writing...."

Over the centuries, it evolved into a symbol of class, professionalism, and personal flair. Today, neckwear is not only a nod to tradition but also a canvas for self-expression in a globalised fashion landscape. Market segmentation and product categories  Ties, scarves, and bowties The market comprises a variety of products, with neckties holding the lion's share in corporate fashion, while scarves dominate winterwear and women's segments. Bowties, though niche, maintain steady traction in formal events and vintage revivals. The recent fusion of classic styles with contemporary patterns has widened the appeal of all three categories. Gender-based preferences and usage Men predominantly drive the necktie and bowtie segment, whereas scarves find favour across genders. Women are increasingly influencing design direction, especially in the luxury silk scarf category. Androgynous fashion trends are further blurring traditional lines, giving rise to gender-neutral neckwear collections. Formal vs. casual neckwear trends While formal neckwear remains integral to corporate wardrobes, casual alternatives such as printed bandanas, infinity scarves, and lightweight stoles are reshaping the everyday fashion narrative. Designers are integrating neckwear into streetwear and hybrid outfits, tapping into a younger, style-conscious audience. Current market landscape and size  Global market valuation and forecast As of 2024, the global neckwear market is estimated at over USD 5.3 billion , with projections indicating a CAGR of 4.2% through 2030. Steady demand from professional sectors, combined with rising fashion consciousness among millennials and Gen Z, fuels this growth trajectory. Regional dominance and growth hotspots North America remains the leading region, owing to strong corporate culture and holiday gift traditions. Meanwhile, the Asia-Pacific region is experiencing rapid growth, propelled by expanding middle-class income, e-commerce penetration, and increased fashion exposure. Europe continues to emphasise artisanal craftsmanship and heritage brands. Key demographics and consumer behaviour Urban professionals, fashion-forward youth, and gift-buyers constitute the core consumers. Preference leans toward brands that offer personalisation, sustainability, and quality materials. There's also an uptick in demand for multifunctional and season-agnostic neckwear pieces. Material innovations and design dynamics  Traditional fabrics vs. sustainable alternatives Silk, wool, cotton, and polyester dominate the traditional material palette. However, eco-conscious consumers are driving interest in bamboo fibre, Tencel, and recycled polyblends. Brands that integrate sustainability without compromising elegance are gaining a competitive edge. Influence of colour psychology and pattern trends Neckwear colour palettes often reflect emotional resonance‚Äîdeep blues for trust, reds for authority, and pastels for approachability. Geometric patterns, floral motifs, and abstract prints have replaced staid stripes and solids, signalling a shift toward individuality. Rise of artisan and bespoke creations Hand-stitched, limited-edition pieces are captivating premium buyers who seek exclusivity. Local artisans, heritage mills, and boutique labels are finding their place alongside mass-market players, adding richness and diversity to the industry's tapestry. E-commerce and omni-channel retail trends  Surge of online marketplaces The proliferation of online retail has democratised access to niche and global brands. Platforms like Etsy, ASOS, and Amazon have become vital conduits for neckwear purchases, offering consumers endless options at their fingertips. Role of social media in product discovery Instagram, Pinterest, and TikTok have turned fashion discovery into a visual feast. Influencers, stylists, and fashion vloggers play a pivotal role in showcasing how to style neckwear, turning dormant accessories into statement pieces. Bridging physical and digital experiences While digital channels dominate, physical retail still plays a crucial role in luxury and tactile engagement. Experiential stores, pop-ups, and AR-based try-ons are helping bridge the sensory gap in neckwear retailing...."

mov_019F0EECB44686DEE74ED3F2BCD551E6,2025-06-25 10:54:14,en,WEB,"‚Äâ (Reuters) -London's main stock indexes were mostly flat on Wednesday as investors digested a batch of corporate earnings and kept a cautious eye on the shaky truce between Israel and Iran. The blue-chip FTSE 100 was flat by 1022 GMT, while the mid-cap FTSE 250 added 0.1% and hovered near a two-week high. Global markets had rallied earlier in the week after a ceasefire between Iran and Israel brought an end to a 12-day air war between the two-arch rivals. However, caution loomed as Washington said talks with Tehran for a long-term peace deal were ""promising."" Markets were now focused on a fresh set of corporate results. Defence engineering company Babcock topped the blue-chip index with a 13.3% gain after upgrading its medium-term guidance as it expects to benefit from boosted defence spending. Fellow defence names Rolls-Royce and Bae Systems gained 1.7% and 0.9%, respectively. The broader sector is one of the best performing on the FTSE so far this year. Defence stocks were further buoyed as Britain announced plans to acquire twelve F-35A fighter jets capable of deploying tactical nuclear weapons during the NATO summit, where member nations committed to increased defence expenditure. Meanwhile, gains on the sectoral charts were led by the personal goods index, with heavyweight Burberry rising 5.6% after brokerage HSBC raised the luxury brand's target price. Halford's gave up early declines and was last up 1% as traders were focused on the bicycle and car products retailer's underlying pre-tax profit that surpassed expectations. On the flipside, Wealth manager Liontrust Asset Management fell 7.7% to the bottom of the small-cap index after reporting a drop in annual profit due to tariff-related market volatility. Labour market data showed cooling conditions, with pay growth lagging inflation and job vacancies dropping - metrics central to policy decisions. On Tuesday, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey pointed to signs of a softer labour market and said interest rates were likely to keep falling. Among others stocks, WPP slid 2.6% after Barclays downgraded the advertising giant, citing recent management changes. (Reporting by Twesha Dikshit; Editing by Tasim Zahid)"

mov_437D6391A74B1B2B9B621915AA620EA4,2025-06-26 16:41:38,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Why did Aritzia open a caf√© inside its flagship store in Toronto? Why did Burberry pivot from fashion photography to cinematic ads that transport viewers into dreamlike sequences? And why is Simons, Canada's remaining department store, incorporating art and interactive technologies into its retail spaces? The answer lies in a trend known as escapist marketing. In an era marked by economic uncertainty, climate anxiety, geopolitical tensions and relentless digital fatigue, brands are turning to fantasy, storytelling and emotionally immersive design to sell products to consumers. Escapist marketing is a strategy that creates emotionally immersive experiences to help consumers temporarily escape from reality, often through fantasy, nostalgia or idealized lifestyles. It taps into the desire for relief from stress or monotony by offering imaginative or aspirational narratives. Escapist marketing has been gaining traction in Canada as consumers are drawn to brands that spark imagination and emotional engagement. According to a 2024 Retail Council of Canada report, Gen Z shoppers prefer brands that offer emotional connection, purpose and creativity. The inaugural Great Canadian Brand Index, which one of us (Eugene Y. Chan) helped develop, found that brands perceived as adventurous, honest and imaginative scored highest in overall public favourability. These are precisely the qualities expressed through fantastical storytelling. As marketing professors and researchers, we've been studying how and why this approach works, and we've found it's grounded in psychology. While brands have long used aspiration in their marketing, today's strategies feel noticeably different. The focus has shifted from luxury and exclusivity to escapism itself, and it's becoming increasingly visible across industries. Consider Coca-Cola's ‚ÄúReal Magic‚Äù campaign, for instance, which uses AI-generated imagery to create whimsical dreamscapes. Or Apple's recent ‚ÄúMother Nature‚Äù ad, which reframes a corporate report about the brand's support of environmental and social issues as a high-concept film starring Octavia Spencer. In London, Gucci's ‚ÄúGucci Cosmos‚Äù series invites visitors into a surreal world of time travel and design history. These marketing campaigns are all designed to be emotional experiences for consumers. This means that the emotional reactions consumers have during interactions with a brand, product or service influence their attitudes, memories and future decision-making. These emotions deepen engagement and strengthen brand loyalty. As consumers continue to feel burned out and overstimulated, fantasy in the form of escapism offers them mental relief. Research shows that immersive experiences ‚Äî whether through entertainment, retail environments or brand storytelling ‚Äî can distract from stressors and promote emotional recovery. By providing a temporary break from reality, fantasy-driven marketing taps into a deep psychological need for comfort and cognitive release. To understand why escapist marketing is so effective, it helps to look at the psychology behind it. One explanation comes from construal level theory, a framework that examines how psychological distance shapes thinking. When something feels far away in time, space or familiarity, we tend to think about it more abstractly. Surreal or fantastical branding increases this distance, shifting consumers' focus from immediate utility to emotional resonance, identity and imagination. While escapist marketing is a broader strategy that aims to help consumers mentally disengage from reality, surreal or fantastical branding is one specific tactic that uses dreamlike, imaginative visuals and narratives to achieve that goal. Not all escapist marketing is surreal, but surreal branding often serves as a powerful form of escapism by transporting consumers into an alternate world. Our research supports this. In one study, we explored how concave visual design ‚Äî where ad elements curve inward ‚Äî draws viewers into the imagery, increases feelings of immersion and enhances message recall and persuasion. This is likely why dreamlike campaigns often use fluid, expansive or distorted imagery. Another factor is anthropomorphism: the tendency to assign human traits to objects or environments. In our studies on destination branding, we found that people are more emotionally connected to places or products that seem to come alive. These findings help explain why fantastical branding resonates so strongly with consumers, particularly in times of stress. Escapism also pairs naturally with luxury branding, where emotional desire often outweighs functional need. In a recent study with our research colleagues, we found that luxury brands were evaluated more favourably when their positioning felt abstract or elevated. Fantasy enhances this effect, allowing consumers to feel both wealthier and transported. There's a fine line between meaningful escapism and empty spectacle. If a brand's fantasy narrative feels disconnected from its action, or appears to mask unethical practices, consumers are quick to notice. Greenwashing, AI overuse or tone-deaf advertising can easily backfire on businesses. When consumers perceive a brand as inauthentic ‚Äî whether through misleading sustainability claims, excessive reliance on AI or insensitive messaging ‚Äî it can erode trust, trigger public criticism and lead to brand avoidance. Studies show that such missteps often result in reputational damage and decreased customer loyalty, particularly among values-driven or socially aware consumers This is where the concept of radical honesty intersects with escapism. The most effective marketing campaigns today blend creativity with transparency. They tell imaginative stories while also acknowledging real-world issues like carbon emissions, labour practices and social justice issues. Brands like Patagonia ‚Äî and Peace Collective in Canada that's working in conjunction with McDonalds ‚Äî have managed to strike this balance by combining emotionally impactful ad campaigns with commitments to ethical and sustainable practices. In times of economic stress and cultural fatigue, Canadians are seeking experiences that resonate with them. When done thoughtfully and grounded in psychology and authenticity, escapist marketing can respond to consumers' desire to feel something deeper, even via something as brief as a 30-second ad. So next time you find yourself smiling at a surreal commercial or lingering in a carefully curated retail space, understand that small moment of wonder is a strategic choice, supported by research...."

The items were headed to Pittsburgh and were intercepted by local CBP agents there. ""The international trade in counterfeit consumer goods is illegal,"" a release from the CBP said. ""It steals trademark holders and tax revenues from the government, it funds international criminal organizations, and the unregulated products can threaten the health and safety of American consumers."" The label on the shipment, from the United Arab Emirates, was marked ""Empty Poly Bag Ladies Hand Bags,"" but instead contained a half dozen counterfeit Rolex Perpetual Cosmograph Daytona watches, a pair of counterfeit Rolex Diamond iced-Out watches and counterfeit Burberry, Chanel, Gucci, Miu and Valentino sunglasses. Agents suspected that the watches and sunglasses were counterfeit and detained them for further inspection when they arrived in Pittsburgh. CBP sent photos and documentation to the Center of Excellence and Expertise and worked with trademark holders, which determined that the items were counterfeit and subject to immediate seizure by Border Patrol agents. ""Unsuspecting consumers could be victimized twice by counterfeit products,"" a statement from James Hindes, CBP's acting port director in Pittsburgh, said, ""such as these fake Rolex watches, because they may end up paying close to authentic prices for cheaper knockoffs, and they'll learn that the product isn't warrantied should it need repair."" The seizure of the counterfeit Rolex watches and sunglasses in Pittsburgh comes just days after CBP intercepted 5 shipments of fake jewelry over 2 nights in Louisville, Ky. that would have been worth more than $25 million had it been authentic."

mov_DAC48A63F0F7FB65A8C9EE3967BBC6A0,2025-06-27 15:06:30,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Sebastian Picardo, the president and chief executive officer of Holt Renfrew for the past five years, is leaving the Canadian luxury retailer on Sept. 30. ‚ÄúAn active global search is underway for our new president and CEO with final candidates being reviewed,‚Äù the Toronto-based company said in a statement Friday. More from WWD Holt also said that Picardo decided to¬†return to Europe ‚Äúto be closer to family and pursue other opportunities.‚Äù He is moving to London. Holt Renfrew, which is owned by the Weston family, is considered Canada's leading luxury retailer. The Weston family, which has owned Holt Renfrew since 1986, are also owners of Wittington Investments, which is based in London and also has two big names in food in its portfolio, Loblaws in Canada and Associated British Foods in the U.K. Picardo joined Holt Renfrew at a time of unprecedented challenges including the pandemic; a slumping Canada economy marked by stalled income growth and high inflation; rising prices on imports due to unfavorable exchange rates, changes in the communities Holt serves due to immigration, and the global luxury decline. But Picardo developed a comprehensive strategy and mission statement to attract more consumers and brand partners, while maintaining Holt's luxury aura and reinforcing its social values. ‚ÄúIn the last few years we've been gradually expanding our offer to bring products that have different price points, but still remain exceptional in the sense that they're very special products,‚Äù Picardo told WWD during an interview in January. ‚ÄúWe ask ourselves, is this product sustainable? Is this product new? Is this product diverse? Is this product Canadian? And can this product be available at Holt Renfrew only? We think of all these different things.‚Äù He led efforts to expand the range of product offerings and prices focusing on contemporary and ‚Äúaccessible‚Äù brands. ‚ÄúWe felt that there was a large group of people who were not necessarily thinking there were things for them at Holt, and that was partly because of our luxury positioning,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúWe still have a luxury positioning, but we know our customers come here because they want to have a multibrand experience. They also like high and low prices, as long as it's a special product, a special brand.‚Äù Such brands as Kim Kardashian's Skims, Mejuri, the Canadian¬†fine jewelry¬†label, as well as Carhartt, Adidas and Commes des Gar√ßons Play were among the ‚Äúaccessible‚Äù labels that were brought into the assortment, as well as Fear of God, a brand that blends luxury and streetwear. Picardo also introduced a marketplace format and a redesigned website that is easier to navigate and bring products to market; provided sales associates with enhanced selling tools, and shut down the freestanding Holt men's store at 100 Bloor Street in Toronto, relocating men's to the 50 Bloor Street flagship nearby. Another part of Holt Renfrew's agenda has involved helping the environment by focusing more on waste reduction, energy efficiency and promoting sustainable brands. In a letter to his employees this week, Picardo highlighted several of his accomplishments, citing an increase in profitability of merchandise owned by Holt Renfrew, more customers choosing to shop Holt's, and a revitalization of the digital offering and experience. Early this year, sources placed Holt Renfrew's annual volume at around 700 million Canadian dollars, which at current exchange rates translates to about $512 million. The company operates six stores: three in Toronto at 50 Bloor Street West, in the Yorkdale and Square One shopping centers; the Holt Renfrew Ogilvy store in Montreal; and in downtown Calgary and downtown Vancouver. Five locations were closed beginning in 2015 as market conditions became more difficult. Before joining Holt Renfrew, ¬†Picardo served as deputy president of Asia's Lane Crawford. Earlier in his career, Picardo worked at Burberry, where he played a key role in building up the digital side of the London-based business. He also held senior slots at Net-a-porter and Alexander McQueen. Picardo's ‚Äústrong leadership and vision played an integral role in guiding Holts through a time never seen before in the retail landscape,‚Äù Holt said in its statement. ‚ÄúWe are grateful for everything Sebastian brought to Holt Renfrew, our brand, our people, partners, and communities. There are many accomplishments and today we are stronger as a brand, and as a proud Canadian business than ever before. As Canada's leading fashion and lifestyle retailer, Holts has a clear strategy, goals, and values to continue to drive the brand by empowering self-expression and igniting positive change.‚Äù Best of WWD Sign up for WWD's Newsletter.

mov_224D08120639D3924918C6ECC151C4C5,2025-06-27 15:35:23,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Emma Raducanu believes that the recent success enjoyed by Jack Draper can only help her as the two old friends tackle Wimbledon, and all the pressure that comes with it, as Britain's No 1 players. Draper has taken over Andy Murray's mantle on the men's side of the game, having reached No 4 in the world rankings after a remarkable six months. Although Draper has never passed the second round at Wimbledon, he is capable of making his first deep run at the All England Club when the championships begin on Monday. The 23-year-old's burgeoning profile ‚Äì he shot a Burberry campaign with the model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in between winning the Indian Wells title and reaching the French Open quarter-finals this month ‚Äì has diverted some of the focus on Raducanu since her breakout summer of 2021, when a run to the fourth round at Wimbledon while ranked 338 in the world was followed by victory in the US Open. ‚ÄúIt is amazing,‚Äù Raducanu said of Draper's rise. ‚ÄúI've known him for so long, so many years, and when we were juniors, we were both pretty promising, and now to kind of be British No 1 on both men and women's side and the real thing is, it's pretty cool. So this Wimbledon, I'm sure, for him, will feel different, but he's in a great place, and obviously with his seeding you know, hopefully it can help him.‚Äù Seeded fourth, Draper is in the other half of the draw from Jannik Sinner and can only face the reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals ‚Äì but could play Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals. Raducanu, meanwhile, is now ranked 38 as she attempts to establish herself at the top of the game chasing players such as the world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, who knocked her out in the second round at Roland Garros and to manage the back problem she has had since just before the French Open. This year will mark the first Wimbledon without line judges, with the tournament adopting electronic line-calling. A total of 23 British players will compete in the men's and women's singles draw, including Katie Boulter, Sonay Kartal, Jacob Fearnley and Cameron Norrie ‚Äì the most British main-draw entrants since 1984. Raducanu believes their friendly competition will push each other to greater heights. ‚ÄúYou see them win their match so you want to win your match, and it's that kind of healthy competition, because you don't want to be the one left behind, you know? And I think that's a good thing, and it's not coming from any bad place,‚Äù said Raducanu. Raducanu has spent much of the past four years trying to adjust to her status as a major champion and all the scrutiny that comes with it. Her difficulties have included several encounters with a stalker during her tournaments in Asia last year, with a tearful Raducanu hiding behind the umpire's chair after spotting the man during her match at the Dubai Open in February. The man, who has never been named publicly, signed a document agreeing to stay away from Raducanu. The All England Club subsequently removed the man from Wimbledon's ticket waiting list. In general, however, Raducanu appears to be in a better place. She has found herself gravitating towards people she knew before her breakthrough results, including her current coach, Mark Petchey. In the past, Raducanu did not trust the people around her enough to be completely open and vulnerable. ‚ÄúIt just felt like I couldn't speak out really, because I didn't want what I said to kind of be shared and spoken about and gossiped about, because you know how the Chinese whispers go. It's just exaggerated and things are twisted. So I just prefer to keep everything in and that is not necessarily the best thing because when you're on the court, you're kind of playing, holding a lot in rather than being expressive, and that's when I'm at my best,‚Äù said Raducanu. Having been academically inclined in her youth, Raducanu recently found herself wanting to return to her studies. She has taken up a one-year art history course, a stark contrast to maths and economics, her chosen A-level subjects. In recent months, she has come to understand that she is a creative person and those qualities are key to her success on the court. ‚ÄúIt is something I've discovered recently,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI think I was growing up very kind of boxed into a way of thinking that, like maths and logic and like ABC, and then as I kind of went through it over the last few years and figured out what I actually enjoy. I think when I play my best, I'm very free. I'm enjoying it, I don't have to be so serious and 'on' all the time, because sometimes on the court, if you're laughing, it can be seen as unserious. But actually for me, it's a better way, and I'm probably going to play better than if I'm just putting so much pressure on myself to be 'on' and perfect.‚Äù This year, Raducanu has made some positive progress, reestablishing herself inside the top 40 and putting herself in position to rise even further. Her susceptibility to injury, however, has continued to be a significant problem. After losing in the second round of Eastbourne on Wednesday, she also noted that she has been dealing with some undisclosed personal issues. Looking at the bigger picture, the goal is to simply ensure that she enjoys her time on and off the court. ‚ÄúSometimes I want to go into the future and think: 'Oh my God, am I going to regret not enjoying this moment?'‚Äù said Raducanu. ‚ÄúI'm 22 now, so I'm kind of living for that person to not have any regrets to look back on.‚Äù"
mov_0E44E847ADBB3F59113A7111639F0734,2025-06-27 15:35:23,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Emma Raducanu believes that the recent success enjoyed by Jack Draper can only help her as the two old friends tackle Wimbledon, and all the pressure that comes with it, as Britain's No 1 players. Draper has taken over Andy Murray's mantle on the men's side of the game, having reached No 4 in the world rankings after a remarkable six months. Although Draper has never passed the second round at Wimbledon, he is capable of making his first deep run at the All England Club when the championships begin on Monday. Related: Wimbledon hands Emma Raducanu tough draw after British teenager Xu The 23-year-old's burgeoning profile ‚Äì he shot a Burberry campaign with the model Rosie Huntington-Whiteley in between winning the Indian Wells title and reaching the French Open quarter-finals this month ‚Äì has diverted some of the focus on Raducanu since her breakout summer of 2021, when a run to the fourth round at Wimbledon while ranked 338 in the world was followed by victory in the US Open. ‚ÄúIt is amazing,‚Äù Raducanu said of Draper's rise. ‚ÄúI've known him for so long, so many years, and when we were juniors, we were both pretty promising, and now to kind of be British No 1 on both men and women's side and the real thing is, it's pretty cool. So this Wimbledon, I'm sure, for him, will feel different, but he's in a great place, and obviously with his seeding you know, hopefully it can help him.‚Äù Seeded fourth, Draper is in the other half of the draw from Jannik Sinner and can only face the reigning champion Carlos Alcaraz in the semi-finals ‚Äì but could play Novak Djokovic in the quarter-finals. Raducanu, meanwhile, is now ranked 38 as she attempts to establish herself at the top of the game chasing players such as the world No 1 Aryna Sabalenka and Iga Swiatek, who knocked her out in the second round at Roland Garros and to manage the back problem she has had since just before the French Open. This year will mark the first Wimbledon without line judges, with the tournament adopting electronic line-calling. A total of 23 British players will compete in the men's and women's singles draw, including Katie Boulter, Sonay Kartal, Jacob Fearnley and Cameron Norrie ‚Äì the most British main-draw entrants since 1984. Raducanu believes their friendly competition will push each other to greater heights. ‚ÄúYou see them win their match so you want to win your match, and it's that kind of healthy competition, because you don't want to be the one left behind, you know? And I think that's a good thing, and it's not coming from any bad place,‚Äù said Raducanu. Raducanu has spent much of the past four years trying to adjust to her status as a major champion and all the scrutiny that comes with it. Her difficulties have included several encounters with a stalker during her tournaments in Asia last year, with a tearful Raducanu hiding behind the umpire's chair after spotting the man during her match at the Dubai Open in February. The man, who has never been named publicly, signed a document agreeing to stay away from Raducanu. The All England Club subsequently removed the man from Wimbledon's ticket waiting list. In general, however, Raducanu appears to be in a better place. She has found herself gravitating towards people she knew before her breakthrough results, including her current coach, Mark Petchey.

mov_3DCAA4F5CF05CEA91AD78582BD8615DE,2025-06-27 16:23:30,en,WEB,"‚Äâ European blue-chips ended solidly higher on Friday, shaking off robust US data which may have cemented another Federal Reserve hold next month, with tariff optimism lifting morale. The FTSE 100 index closed up 63.31 points, 0.7%, at 8,798.91. The FTSE 250 was up 241.30 points, 1.1%, at 21,715.96, and the AIM All-Share added 2.29 points, 0.3%, at 769.33. For the week, the FTSE 100 added 0.3%, the FTSE 250 surged 2.7% and the AIM All-Share gained 1.3%. Over the course of the whole first half of the year, the FTSE 100 has climbed 7.7%. In European equities on Friday, the CAC 40 in Paris jumped 1.8%, while the DAX 40 in Frankfurt surged 1.6%. The pound was quoted lower at 1.3713 dollars at the time of the London equities close, compared to 1.3733 dollars on Thursday. The euro stood at 1.1717 dollars, higher against 1.1698 dollars. Against the yen, the dollar was trading higher at 144.75 yen compared with 144.48 yen. The yield on the US 10-year Treasury was quoted at 4.27%, narrowing from 4.28%. The yield on the US 30-year Treasury was quoted at 4.82%, narrowing from 4.84%. In New York, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 1.0%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite each added 0.6%. ‚ÄúStock markets this week have been on a frenzy, with Nasdaq leading the US Indices to new all-times on Wednesday and the S&P 500 is joining its tech-focused colleague,‚Äù Oanda analyst Elior Manier commented. ‚ÄúMarkets are awaiting and getting a few good news on the US trade deals ‚Äì the latest is the White House announcing that July 9 is in the end not too important, and Trump mentioning the completion of a deal with China, however the details are still missing.‚Äù The analyst added: ‚ÄúEven the release of PCE data hasn't sparked major volatility. The buying momentum after the de-escalation and ceasefire in the Middle East really has been mind-boggling. Dip buyers have had the hand in the past five years, particularly when bullish catalysts come into play (or bearish catalysts fade away). A three-month recovery took the [S&P 500] back from 4,800 all the way to 6,160 current levels.‚Äù The US Federal Reserve's key inflationary gauge, the core personal consumption expenditures price index, was higher than anticipated in May, data published by the Bureau of Economic Analysis showed Friday. Annual core PCE inflation was 2.7% in May, accelerating a notch from 2.6% in April, the latter upwardly revised from 2.5%. Market consensus for May had been 2.6%, according to FXStreet. With core PCE inflation rising, it is unlikely that the Federal Reserve will cut US interest rates before September, much to the chagrin of President Donald Trump, who is pushing for immediate rate cuts. The White House said on Thursday no decision is imminent on naming a successor to Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell, after a report suggested the president could do so this summer. ‚ÄúNo decisions are imminent, although the president has the right to change his mind,‚Äù a White House official told AFP. ‚ÄúThe president has many good options to nominate as the next Federal Reserve chairman,‚Äù the official added. Mr Powell's term as chief of the independent central bank ends in May 2026, and the choice of a successor by this summer or autumn would be sooner than usual. But a Wall Street Journal report late Wednesday said President Trump has considered selecting and unveiling Mr Powell's replacement by September or October. Among the stocks shining across the Atlantic, Nike jumped 15%. The sportswear firm reported a drop in annual profit amid softer revenue and warned of a one billion dollar cost increase in financial 2026 due to new tariffs, which it aims to mitigate through targeted actions across the business. AJ Bell analyst Russ Mould commented: ‚ÄúThe footwear manufacturer has brought back Elliott Hill as CEO to drive a turnaround and investors lapped up his every word on plans to get the business back on track with new sports-focused product lines.‚Äù JD Sports rose 7.6%, the athleisure retailer leading the way on the FTSE 100 in a positive read across. ‚ÄúA healthier Nike playing catch-up with product innovation could stimulate new demand for its products and theoretically JD Sports would benefit as it is a key retailer of Nike shoes,‚Äù Mr Mould added. Also on the up in London were stocks with an exposure to China. Among them, luxury fashion firm Burberry added 7.1%. XTB analyst Kathleen Brooks commented: ‚ÄúThe key theme for markets in the next week and a half will be US trade agreements, as July 9 is the deadline for the reciprocal tariff reprieve. There has been some good news on this front. Both China and the US have confirmed that they have agreed a trade framework going forward.‚Äù Brent oil was quoted lower at 66.83 dollars a barrel late on Friday afternoon in London from 67.83 dollars late Thursday. Gold fetched 3,273.76 dollars an ounce, lower against 3,322.21 dollars. Weaker gold prices hurt precious metal miners. Hochschild Mining gave back 2.6%. Elsewhere, Next 15 added 15%, recovering some of its 28% slide from Thursday. It confirmed it is in early talks to dispose of some of its brands, a day after it announced a new chief executive and warned on profit. The London-based business growth consultant said it is actively considering options to speed up value creation across its business units and enhancing the delivery of its commercial and strategic objectives. ‚ÄúThe board's primary focus is maximising shareholder value. At this time, there can be no certainty that any agreement will be reached, nor as to the terms of any such agreement, including if sufficient value is not realised. Further updates will be provided as appropriate,‚Äù Next 15 said. The biggest risers on the FTSE 100 were JD Sports, up 6.18p at 87.88p, Ashtead Group, up 249.00p at 4,732.00p, Melrose Industries, up 18.60p at 536.00p, Standard Chartered, up 33.00p at 1,219.00p, and IMI, up 50.00p at 2,116.00p. The biggest fallers on the FTSE 100 were Endeavour Mining, down 96.00p at 2,176.00p, Fresnillo, down 63.00p at 1,433.00p, Babcock, down 20.00p at 1,137.00p, BAE Systems, down 25.50p at 1,862.00p, and Coca-Cola Europacific Partners, down 70.00p at 6,640.00p.

mov_85BD933C7CFDAFA08FA0B18FC63523EC,2025-06-27 16:34:49,en,WEB,"‚Äâ The Oasis reunion might not be happening at Glastonbury, but the rock band's famous aesthetic is well and truly alive at Worthy Farm ‚Äì almost as ubiquitous as an unsolicited singalong to ‚ÄúWonderwall‚Äù at the campsite around 3am. Few festival trends have proven as stubborn as the bucket hat and now, with Noel and Liam Gallagher preparing to reunite on tour next week, Glastonbury-goers are out in force sporting said hats along with camo pants, gore-tex trainers and Adidas galore. No parkas, though ‚Äì apparently this is overkill (even if Liam Gallagher has in the past been spotted wearing them in the scorching Spanish sun). We're calling it Oasis-core. As the band's merch stores start to pop up across the UK, flogging everything from football shirts to shot glasses, sales of Oasis-inspired products have also surged by 150 per cent. Searches for bucket hats are up 275 per cent, suggesting that they've somehow transcended from somewhat naff sartorial staple to a must-have when incorporated into an Oasis-inspired outfit. Far from fashion victims ‚Äì most fans sporting bucket hats this year look more like Hackney hipsters. It's all a tad ironic considering Oasis were initially rumoured to be making their big comeback at Glastonbury. Cue major disappointment when it was revealed this wouldn't be the case, but it also explains why the Oasis-Glastonbury fan crossover is rather high. It probably helps that they've already headlined several times ‚Äì their 1995 set on the Pyramid is still widely considered one of the best in the festival's history. The jackets the Gallaghers wore then (Liam in a parka; Noel in a duffle) became integral to their identity as a band, and arguably still are to this day. Onto Glastonbury's muddy fields. Branded merch aside, the Oasis look is one that has always been popular among a certain set of east London-dwelling, natural wine-drinking, roll-up smoking set. It's normcore, really, which came to the fore a few years ago ‚Äì check out the Instagram account @realhousewivesofclapton for frequent satirisations of this look. This summer, though, it seems to have gone mainstream by way of a cornucopia of Oasis-adjacent items. Beyond the bucket hats (seen this weekend in a variety of animal prints and eye-popping colours), there are also oversized vintage football shirts, strappy sports tops, cycling shorts, retro parkas, baggy trousers, cargo shorts, tiny sunglasses, and sporty trainers, like the black Salomon ones with the rainbow-coloured tongue we've seen on literally everyone. ‚ÄúI don't have tickets for Oasis but money-wise it was either Glasto or Oasis this year,‚Äù Will, 32, from Rhode Island told ‚ÄúBucket hats are very practical in the sun for having shade with you at all times, but let's be honest they're also a little bit funny. I don't think they're supposed to actually look good, but at Glastonbury it's fun to look a little bit ridiculous, that's kinda the vibe.‚Äù Frederick, 29, from Bristol, remarked: ‚ÄúIt's a hungover fit really, you just chuck whatever you find on.‚Äù Of the stubborn refusal of bucket hats to die, he added: ‚ÄúIt's not really a fashion thing, it keeps the sun off your face. It's more practical. we don't really use sunscreen that much, let's face it. We pack light.‚Äù Asked whether men put much thought into their fashion choices at music festivals, he responded: ‚ÄúMaybe football shirts. And Adidas just released their range with Oasis... Adidas in general is just so influential right now to be fair.‚Äù If any more evidence was needed that Oasis-core is thriving at Glastonbury 2025, an actual Gallagher is strolling around sporting just that: Lennon Gallagher, the 25-year-old son of Liam, at a pre-Glastonbury party held with Barbour at the nearby hotel, The Pig Near Bath. Dressed in a dusty blue Barbour jacket paired with white combat trousers, a khaki shoulder bag, red baseball cap and slim black shades, the model was the spit of his musician father. Similarly Oasis-coded is actor Charlie Rowe, photographed making his way around the fields in fisherman garb complete with a waistcoat, bucket hat and ankle wellies. He also had a similar shoulder bag. Of course, the Oasis look is unisex, and you can roll with it with or without a bucket hat. For versatility on the trend, look to model Mia Reagan who is clocked walking through the site in a pair of loose, long camo shorts paired with Burberry ankle wellies, a purple strappy bra top and the signature shoulder bag that looks like it had been tied to the side of her trousers. It might not carry the same specific Oasis items as some of the other outfits we've seen, but it's very much tapping into the same vibe: relaxed, tomboyish, inherently Nineties. So if you want to get with the times at Glastonbury this year, all you really need is one of your dad's old football shirts, a pair of baggy shorts or trousers and, of course, the oh-so important bucket hat, which apparently really does live forever."

1lnmawa,2025-06-29 18:48:56,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Every little town has their own scary story attached to them. Whether it's a murder mystery about a serial killer who never got caught, or a ‚ÄúDon't walk under the overpass at midnight‚Äù, or just a haunted house at the end of the road. My town has a haunted gym. Not a ghost or anything similar, but the building itself, more precisely - a part of it. A locker, at the corner of the men's changing room behind an opening in the wall. You'd easily miss the lockers in that section of the changing room if you weren't paying attention. But everybody who lives here knows about it, the stories surrounding that one locker. The numberless locker. Nobody uses it willingly and for good reasons. Whether you believe in scary stories or not, the realm of creepiness is a stranger to nobody. Stories range from people's gym bags disappearing if left in the numberless locker overnight, which is usually blamed on the janitor stealing them, to being a gateway to hell. But reality is far, far worse. My name is Alex. When I was twelve my family and I moved into a new town, which for obvious reasons will not be named. Me and my younger sister shared the misery of leaving our hometown. In hindsight, I was probably a shitty kid who didn't care about anything in the world outside of friends and games. By all means, I should have been grateful for what I had, but being a twelve year old without a care in the world, this was the end. ‚ÄúNew house, same home‚Äù my dad would say, ultimately knowing his efforts to cheer me and my sister up were futile anyways. And I don't blame him, despite how appealing he tried to make it sound, I knew he didn't want this either, for any of us. ‚ÄúA new opportunity‚Äù sounds a lot better than ‚Äúforced to get a new job‚Äù. I can't believe how strong someone can be for the sake of others, but my dad was a testament to that fact. ‚ÄúThere's our new home‚Äù, my dad said, pointing to a small white house. ‚ÄúIt's nothing fancy, but we'll make it our home in no time‚Äù, said my mom, shooting a glance at both me and my sister. ‚ÄúI don't like it here‚Äù, my sister said. ‚ÄúOur old house was much bigger‚Äù, I said. ‚ÄúGive it some time, I'm sure you two will love it here once we get settled in"", my mom said. ""I heard the school serve ice cream once every month."" Not a word was uttered, and the only sound heard from miles away when we pulled into the driveway was my dads sigh. A comforting look was shared between my mom and dad as we all got out of the car. After what felt like an extremely nerve wracking and uncomfortably short house tour, a much required but heavy feeling of needing to be left alone for a second fell on everyone. After staying in my room for a while, exploring things to dislike, my dads presence covered the frame of the door. ‚ÄúListen kid, I know you're upset about the move and all, but this could be the start of your new life. New places to explore, new friends‚Äù, he said. ‚ÄúI like the friends I have.‚Äù ‚ÄúI know, I know. And I know nothing I say can cheer you up right now. So how about I take you around town and see if we can find something worth our while here?‚Äù I have my dad to thank for always being able to help me out of a bad mood. We rolled around the town for a while, calling it small would be an understatement. Nothing caught my eye and my sour mood slowly crept its way back to me, until we turned a corner of an empty parking lot. A small, one floored building engulfed by abandonment immediately came into my view. It would have easily fallen into a realm of forgetfulness, yet, a lively colored sign clearly stated ‚ÄúBurberry Gym‚Äù, which was nothing short of a miracle to me at this point. Before you say anything, that's not the real name, don't bother searching for it. ‚ÄúWhat about that dad? Think they're open?‚Äù ‚ÄúAren't you a bit young to start going to the gym?‚Äù ‚ÄúYou really want me to stay mad, huh?‚Äù He chuckled as he turned the car towards the gym. The outside of the gym was as desolate and empty as the town of which it was housed in, covered in graffiti containing everything from slurs to inexplicable sentences. Litters of garbage and an assorted collection of trash cans coated the pavement surrounding the building, which gave nothing to save it from its sorrow. As sad and dark this place looked, this was the start of a new life for me, and I couldn't wait to begin...."

So I blind bought Eclaire because it was like $18 with free shipping from Walmart. I wanted to like it so much but it just didn't hit right for me. It smells a bit like Choco Musk but kind of powdery. I'm not sure how to describe it. It did seem to get a little better over the day, so I can see that this perfume may get better over time. Ultimately I decided to return it."

A lo largo de los a√±os, los asistentes han convertido el evento en un espect√°culo de vestimenta, desde los conjuntos pastel de la princesa Diana en los a√±os 90 hasta las modernas interpretaciones de la sastrer√≠a cl√°sica de Zendaya. Los estrictos c√≥digos de vestimenta del torneo, especialmente el requisito completamente blanco para los jugadores, han inspirado a los invitados a encontrar formas creativas de destacarse mientras se adhieren a la tradici√≥n. A medida que se desarrolla la 138¬™ edici√≥n, es el momento perfecto para reflexionar sobre los momentos de moda de Wimbledon m√°s emblem√°ticos. A continuaci√≥n, profundizamos en los estilos destacados que han adornado el torneo a lo largo de los a√±os ‚Ä¶ En 1995, la princesa Diana asisti√≥ a Wimbledon con un traje de falda amarilla pastel. Un momento que todav√≠a reside en nuestras tablas de humor hoy. Emma Corrin lleg√≥ a Wimbledon de 2023 en su propia versi√≥n del traje de verano amarillo beb√© de Polo Ralph Lauren (completo con un corte de zumbido blanqueado). Alguna vez nuestra musa de estilo, Alexa Chung combin√≥ su falda de algod√≥n beige con elegantes slingbacks negros y un c√°rdigan con cable al torneo de tenis 2024. Usando una chaqueta de espiga, una corbata de punto, un bot√≥n azul y jeans de Ralph Lauren, Zendaya obviamente combin√≥ el look con una bolsa LV (para quien es embajadora). La pareja se visti√≥ con sus mejores trajes blancos y beige para Wimbledon en 1995. El modelo se puso un ajuste completamente blanco debajo de una zanja amarilla beb√©, combinada con planos de ballet negro Chanel y gafas de sol a juego. Una vez m√°s, este tono amarillo mantecoso es una cancha favorita, esta vez por el modelo Jourdan Dunn en 2023. Un caso para los blancos de tenis, incluso en las tribunas. Un Margot Robbie muy embarazada se puso el lado de la cancha de Ala√Øa de lunares en 2024. La modelo llevaba un vestido de resbal√≥n azul de ma√≠z de Ralph Lauren en 2023. Miller se dirigi√≥ a Wimbledon en 2016 con un aspecto completo de Burberry. Y, por supuesto, no podemos olvidar mencionar esta toma ic√≥nica de la ley y la apariencia de Miller en 2004. En 2016, el actor se puso este rosa de dos piezas establecido por Stella McCartney, mientras que el socio Chiwetel Ejiofor llevaba a Thom Sweeney. Turner asisti√≥ al torneo en 2023 en esta falda azul marina y blusa blanca. El Bridgerton Star se puso una simple trinchera y una falda de seda en 2022. Las ramitas de FKA salieron con un traje de lino blanco crujiente mientras asist√≠a al s√©ptimo d√≠a de Wimbledon en 2021. Im√°genes de caracter√≠sticas: uno, dos."

Pi√π che la London Fashion Week, a dettare tendenza in fatto di stile e outfit in Gran Bretagna √® un altro evento, attesissimo e sempre molto affollato. Il Festival di Glastonbury 2025, non a caso, √® stato ancora una volta sinonimo di un'estetica ben riconoscibile e intramontabile. Mentre gli occhi del mondo erano puntati su Venezia e sul faraonico matrimonio Bezos-Sanchez, nella fresca campagna del Somerset andava in scena un altro tipo di show. Pi√π discreto e sofisticato, ma non meno d'effetto. Tra stivaletti della pioggia, giacche antivento e abiti ultra femminili, il guardaroba di Glastonbury 2025 si conferma tanto attuale quanto d'ispirazione anni Novanta e Duemila. Parola di star. Margot Robbie, biker e sportiva Tra le tante star accorse al celeberrimo festival inglese, spicca l'attrice e produttrice australiana. Dopo la gravidanza, infatti, Margot Robbie √® tornata in grande stile. Protagonista di un talk, Robbie ha optato per un mini dress dal design sportivo firmato Miu Miu, contraddistinto da un inaspettato dettaglio cut out sulla schiena. Completavano il look un paio di stivali in stile biker con tanto di fibbia metallica e una giacca di jeans legata in vita. Il risultato finale, grintoso e femminile, √® perfetto da replicare in vista dei prossimi concerti estivi. Margot Robbie arriva ad un panel organizzato all'interno del Festival di Glastonbury 2025 (Photo by Samir Hussein/WireImage) Leggi anche Glastonbury 2025, lezioni di stile all'inglese Non sarebbe il Festival di Glastonbury senza una miriade di stivali della pioggia, di ogni altezza e nuance, preferibilmente firmati Hunter. La battaglia contro l'imprevedibile meteo inglese ‚Äì e l'inevitabile fango ‚Äì pu√≤ essere dunque condotta in grande stile. Lo sa bene Daisy Edgar-Jones, che in questa edizione ha sfoggiato un leggero abito in lino con spalline sottili. Oltre ai rain boots, il look era completato da una mini bag di Gucci in rafia e pelle, per un gradito tocco estivo.

La candidata al Premio Oscar per A Complete Unknown, infatti, si √® distinta grazie ad un maxi abito con schiena scoperta, illuminato da una collana con pendente argentato. La borsa hobo in suede e gli stivali alti in pelle, poi, rendevano il look contemporaneo e chic. Grazie alla collaborazione con la stylist Dani Michelle, Barbaro si sta velocemente affermando come un'icona di stile da tenere d'occhio. Accessori che si fanno notare: √® questo il segreto dell'outfit sfoggiato da Monica Barbaro (Photo by Samir Hussein/WireImage) Leggi anche Passione Y2K L'estetica simbolo del Festival di Glastonbury esercita da anni un fascino impareggiabile su appassionate di moda di ogni et√† e provenienza. Le immagini di Kate Moss, Alexa Chung e Sienna Miller tra i prati del Somerset non smettono di fare la loro comparsa in moodboard d'ispirazione e pagine Instagram. Si colloca in bilico tra passato e presente, per l'appunto, l'outfit indossato dalla modella inglese Mia Regan. La top model ha abbinato un bikini dal finish brillante ad un paio di capri pants in stile workwear. Un foulard annodato tra i passanti dei pantaloni e una collana pendente regalano al look un tocco inaspettato.

Il merito √® senza dubbio di line-up accattivanti e in linea con i tempi, sebbene non si possa negare quanto l'aspetto estetico e stilistico del festival ricopra un ruolo primario. Lo sa bene la maison Burberry, che nell'ultima campagna Burberry Festival ha voluto rendere omaggio proprio alla cultura musicale britannica.

Burberry kicked things off in true British style with a campaign shot on the Glastonbury site. A series of portraits include hip young things, 90s legends like Goldie and Liam Gallagher wearing trench coats, checked kilts and Harrington jackets. In fact, Liam wore his own Burberry parka from Christopher Bailey's Spring/Summer 2018 collection for the shoot ‚Äì a piece soon to be reissued in a limited run, landing in-store and online this July. Closer to home, we've been digging out vintage gems, putting together outfits with what we've got, and channeling Mossy nostalgia. Here's what we've been wearing (and dancing in) this summer. Amie at Glastonbury: Y2K revival   For her first Glastonbury, Field Grey designer Amie channelled the ultimate 2000s festival icon: Kate Moss. Think golden lurex, statement belts and, of course, mud-splattered boots. Her hero piece was a one-shoulder cream and gold knit dress from our founder Janice Turner's 1996 RCA graduate show ‚Äì bravely revived for a very stylish comeback in the fields of 2025. ‚ÄúI'm inspired by those early It-girl moments ‚Äì Sienna, Alexa, Kate,‚Äù says Amie. ‚ÄúThere's something timeless about the mix of grunge and glamour.‚Äù She layered the dress with a vintage suede tassel jacket, sourced from Vinted . A Y2K boho belt completes the throwback look, while hiking shoes were an obligatory sensible addition. ‚ÄúGlasto is a marathon,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúComfort is key!‚Äù Thomas at Beyonc√©: customised cowboy   For his two-night stint (yes, two) at Totenham Hotspur Stadium to see Queen Bey herself, designer Thomas took inspiration straight from the source: Cowboy Carter. Where Renaissance was pure futurism, this tour is all about American roots reimagined. ‚ÄúI wanted to pay homage to the Western themes of the album while giving it a sparkle Beyonc√© would be proud of,‚Äù he says. Thomas customised his denim vest with star patches and diamant√© trim, while cowboy boots and a wide-brimmed hat completed the look. Most of the pieces came from his own wardrobe, lovingly upcycled. ‚ÄúI've been a Beyonc√© fan since Destiny's Child,‚Äù he says. ‚ÄúThis tour felt like a celebration of Black country music, of heritage, of joy. It was incredible to be part of it. We ended up getting tickets for the second night and 15 friends from all over the world came over. It felt like our own little festival.‚Äù Anna at Moovin Festival: rave spirit   Up north in the rolling hills of Whitebottom Farm near Stockport, our digital content manager Anna tried out Moovin Festival ‚Äì an independent weekender with a heavy-hitting line-up and laidback vibe. The outfit: a printed top, battered denim shorts, and chunky boots with green detailing that happened to match the print. ‚ÄúI didn't overthink it. Everything ended up green, so we're calling that a theme,‚Äù she says. A pale green Nike cap and a colour-block Sweaty Betty mac (yes, more green) were on standby for the rain ‚Äì which made a blink and you'll miss it appearance. ‚ÄúAs a former 90s raver, the line-up was right up my street,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúDJ Paulette, Derrick Carter and even a techno ceilidh ‚Äì chaos, but brilliant fun.‚Äù The standout moment? ‚ÄúEzra Collective's closing set. Pure, unadulterated joy.‚Äù The post Burberry-inspired, field-tested: our festival looks appeared first on Field Notes | Blog and News | Field Grey ."

I echo the current majority sentiment here on her,  but do find myself watching her old 2015/2016 apartment vlogs a lot. She was def more relatable in that time, but I didn't watch much of her nomad content when she was doing it all--it was super out of touch. For her current vids, I just watch if I need something I can breeze through or have something on. Also re: OP--unfortunately all influencer eventually conform to the same formula of content. Same styles, brands, aspirations, ""aesthetics,"" etc. One thing I always liked about Taylor though is she isn't your typical name-brand this, name-brand that guru.

As expected, Glasto 2025 left no crumbs when it comes to style, with the queen of summer style, Rita Ora, leading the charge. You may also like Posting a recap of her mega weekend at the iconic Somerset event to her Instagram on Monday evening, the singer, actress, and beauty buff proved just how enviable her festival wardrobe really is. One look in particular that has gone straight to the top of our summer style moodboard is her boots and bikini look. Styling a classic tartan print Burberry string bikini with a set of black leather pirate boots, the 34-year-old leaned into the 'less is more' aesthetic. The beachside meets emo-chic look was made all the more festival appropriate thanks to her ultra chunky waist belt, which came complete with a large and in-charge silver ring accent. Adding to the look, Rita paired her stack of colourful admission wrist bands with a slew of gold bangles and a dainty watch. To match her armcandy accessories, she layered a chunky necklace with other pendant options to create a mismatched ensemble. The Burberry Cobb bikini, which features as the hero piece in the brand's latest Burberry Check campaign starring Alexa Chung and Cara Delevingne, seems to be a fan favourite for Rita. In another snap shared, she paired the itsy bitsy top with a pair of micro mini bright yellow Adidas shorts and her beloved brown Acne Studios buckle boots. You may also like Glastonbury weekend was a famous face affair, Rita hanging out all weekend with Anya Taylor-Joy, Lorde, Alexa Chung, Idris Elba and her husband Taika Waititi. It's safe to say we're jealous of both Rita's wardrobe and the company she keeps."

mov_AE68DC4D03200A163F33590A8D76A3BC,2025-07-01 13:11:00,en,WEB,"‚Äâ The global personal luxury goods market, valued at USD 410 billion in 2024, is projected to reach USD 526 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.24%. The U.S.-China trade war poses challenges, impacting costs and availability. Key trends include circular economy initiatives, online retail strategies, and urban demand in emerging markets. Segment growth varies, with watches and jewelry leading, while beauty and fragrances witness fastest growth. APAC remains the dominant region, driven by urbanization and digital retail transformation. Major players like LVMH and Rolex leverage strategic partnerships and innovation to maintain market positioning. Personal Luxury Goods Market Dublin, July 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Personal Luxury Goods Market Research Report 2025-2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Personal Luxury Goods Market was valued at USD 410 billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 526 billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 4.24%. The global personal luxury goods market is fragmented and characterized by numerous manufacturers that hold modest market share. Key players, including LVH, Prada Group, Rolex, Kering, and Richemont, among others, have established dominance in the market by continuously innovating and expanding their product offerings. Major vendors are strategically implementing innovative technologies to maintain their market positions. For instance, in 2023, Burberry introduced its virtual store by partnering with Blankos Block Party, a gaming platform, and offering interactive product discovery. The companies in the personal luxury goods industry are also focusing on several strategic partnerships with other providers to ensure continuous supply chains and manufacturing capabilities. For instance, in 2023, Kering completed a 30% acquisition of the Italian luxury fashion house Valentino. The partnership is between Valentino's parent company, Mayhoola, and it has also provided an option for Kering to acquire the remaining 70% by 2028. The leaders in the personal luxury goods market are making significant R&D investments to enhance the availability and differentiation of their products. For instance, in 2024, Richemont acquired Vhernier, which is an Italian jewelry brand, to enhance its Jewelry Maisons division. Furthermore, companies are increasingly expanding their product range and strengthening their market positions through acquisitions and partnerships. For instance, in 2024, Lavie Luxe launched its new 18% fragrance concentration perfume line, featuring four Eau de Parfum fragrances named LUSH, LILY, LAGOON, and LOVE. Consumers are increasingly interested in luxury goods that are designed with circular economic principles, such as those that can be easily upcycled. Gucci was the first luxury brand to use ECONYL recycled nylon in ready-wear pieces, which is a 100% recycled nylon derived from fishing nets, textile waste, and a thick pile fabric used for carpets and upholstery. Luxury brands have increasingly adopted online approaches to meet evolving consumer expectations. For instance, in 2023, Dior was the most popular luxury brand online because of its strategic investments in digital marketing, e-commerce, and social media engagement. This approach helped the brand to engage a wider audience, which has boosted its online sales, especially in markets like China and the US. Brands strategically position themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops in places like Bali and Phuket. It has created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. Hence, such factors are supporting the demand for the personal luxury goods market across emerging nations. As the global economies continue to grow, disposable income levels rise, leading to increased spending on luxury items like footwear. Consumers are increasingly inclined towards luxury footwear because of changing lifestyles and fashion trends. Luxury footwear companies are focusing on the growing consumer base in developing countries such as India and other Southeast Asian countries, where wealth and demand for luxury goods are rising. In 2022, Louis Vuitton introduced its exclusive footwear collection for the Indian market, which features new colors like Rani Pink and glittering designs for celebrating India's cultural heritage. Urbanization in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia continues to drive demand for the personal luxury goods market. In India, platforms like Luxepolis have significantly supported the development of the market by offering new and pre-owned luxury items to a growing audience in smaller cities, as the growing urban population increases the demand for high-end items. Brands are strategically positioning themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops to places like Bali and Phuket. Additionally, collaborations between fashion houses and hospitality venues such as Fendi's beach club in Marbella have created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS The disruption in the supply chain has led to increased costs for raw materials, logistics, and transportation, which have raised operational costs and are often passed on to end consumers which leading to higher luxury goods prices. The focus on limited production to maintain exclusivity significantly raises the production costs for luxury brands. Brands often face higher unit costs for manufacturing, sourcing premium materials, and utilizing skilled labor for producing limited edition items. This limits scalability and hampers the personal luxury goods market demand. Furthermore, major brands occasionally face backlash for products or marketing campaigns, such as Louis Vuitton for selling a scarf inspired by the Palestinian keffiyeh and a jacket that seems to present Jamaican culture by using the country's flags but incorrectly represented. These factors hamper the brand value and show the need for careful consideration in global marketing efforts. PERSONAL LUXURY GOODS MARKET GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS The APAC region dominated the global personal luxury goods market, accounting for a share of over 38% in 2024. APAC is experiencing a surge in urbanization and rising disposable income, particularly in countries like China, India, and Southeast Asian countries. A growing middle and upper-middle class is driving demand for luxury goods as markers of status, success, and aspiration. As consumers become more brand-conscious, luxury ownership is increasingly viewed as a symbol of achievement...."

mov_F5FFB5E6CAAFD8C981AAA9AD9A2697C5,2025-07-01 19:03:33,en,WEB,"‚Äâ With the sun setting past teatime on a baking Wimbledon day, and the shade gradually emerging across the court, Britain's top singles player entered the arena in a primetime slot. Burberry models and social media influencers posed and pouted courtside, eager to show off their prized viewing spot. Only 23 years young, Jack Draper had better get used to this. Yet as first rounds at Wimbledon go, this was as comfortable as they come. Frankly, Draper could play on this stage for another decade and won't have an easier match at the All England Club. While world No 4 Alexander Zverev crashed out 200 metres south of the grounds on Centre Court ‚Äì the 12th men's seed to be eliminated in the first round here ‚Äì Draper's mission against Sebastian Baez on Court 1 was simple: total destruction. So much so that he forced his opponent into submission. A scoreline of supremacy read 6-2, 6-2, 2-1 (ret.) , with the Argentinean retiring due to a knee injury. With a bit of luck, Draper will be back home in Putney in time for Tuesday night's highlights show. Seventy-four minutes and done. Mission accomplished. The quick duration is not insignificant. At Grand Slams, playing best-of-five sets every other day, any chance of respite should gratefully be grasped. Draper's conditioning has deserted him before, not least when he vomited on court in the US Open semi-finals last summer. But this is the new and improved Draper: a well-oiled powerhouse and physical specimen. Here, he was keen not to waste anyone's time. Although that was not the party line. ‚ÄúI wanted to play a bit longer, in all honesty,‚Äù he said, with a smirk, on-court afterwards. ‚ÄúI was getting my tennis together a bit. It's no way to win like that, I wish Sebastian the best of recoveries.‚Äù Now the world No 4, Draper's rise from 28 in the world one year ago has been meteoric. With his run to the final four in New York and an illustrious title at Indian Wells behind him, the 23-year-old not only believes effusively in his hard graft and ability. Now, he has the results and the ranking to back it up. What's next? A tougher test, in the form of 2017 finalist Marin Cilic, in the second round on Thursday. Draper has not actually progressed to the third round at SW19 before; a record he'll be desperate to extinguish, with the weight of expectation around him now expecting at least a quarter-final. In this brief opening glimpse, it's hard to argue against the notion he'll have too much firepower for 36-year-old Cilic. Injured or not, Baez was never going to threaten the Briton today. By ranking, there were only five players who could've posed a tougher test for Draper in the opening two rounds. But the reality is that the world No 38 was on a five-match losing streak and had not won on a grass court in over two years. Truth be told, there are clay court specialists, and then there's Sebastian Baez. The Argentine is only a year older than Draper but actually has four more ATP tour titles to his name. However, six of those seven have come on the red dust; a surface Baez makes his unequivocal priority every season. In fact, this contest was his first match with pristine green under his shoes this year. Early on, you could tell. Draper broke in the first game of the match, dictating and dominating with his humdinger of a forehand: a shot so powerful it can go radically go astray in moments of tension, it is the Brit's biggest weapon when it's on song. Coupled with his whipped lefty serve, it makes for a handy one-two on the low-trajectory Wimbledon grass. Another break soon followed, signs of Baez's imminent surrender incoming. Having lost the opening set, Baez experienced a sudden slip changing direction, another sign of a player unaccustomed to the nuances of grass-court movement. Draper pounced quickly on his prey, immediately hitting a drop-shot to perfection. Beyond his imposing muscularity, the Brit's improved matchplay instincts are also worthy of merit in explaining his impressive last 12 months. He broke again to start the second, while Baez saw a group of medical staff who tended to his right knee. The Argentine opted to continue but was powerless to halt Draper's assault. The British No 1 went a double break up with a sparkling forehand crosscourt on the run, to the roar of 10,000 in Wimbledon's second biggest court. After an hour, Draper was a set from home. A quick break to love saw Draper lead 2-1 in the third set when Baez called it a day, due to a right knee injury. In sum, Draper lost four points against his serve all evening. And with big-serving dark horse Alexander Bublik, a potential third-round opponent, surprisingly exiting earlier on Tuesday, Draper's route to the second week looks a bit more rosy than 24 hours ago. For this to be the biggest fortnight of his life, things have to fall into place...."

Burberry models and social media influencers posed and pouted courtside, eager to show off their prized viewing spot. Only 23 years young, Jack Draper had better get used to this. Yet as first rounds at Wimbledon go, this was as comfortable as they come. Frankly, Draper could play on this stage for another decade and won't have an easier match at the All England Club.

The strategic combination creates a vertically integrated retail operations platform that streamlines facilities management, staff learning, task execution, and communication. The integration brings together Worksmith's strengths in vendor management and service execution with Progress Retail's expertise in employee training and streamlining store operations and experience. This expanded capability targets the growing need among retailers for a unified solution to run operations efficiently at scale. Bryan Burkhart, CEO of Worksmith, said the acquisition marks a significant step toward realizing the company's long-term vision: ‚ÄúThe acquisition of Progress Retail represents the next step in our vision at Worksmith to become the one-stop shop for retail operations. Up until now, retail operations leaders have had to rely on a multitude of different systems to run their complex, geographically-dispersed, operations. With the acquisition of Progress Retail by Worksmith, this job becomes a little easier.‚Äù Addressing a Fragmented Retail Tech Stack The combined platform aims to solve a major pain point for retailers: the fragmentation of tools used across departments like HR, learning and development, visual merchandising, and store maintenance. By unifying these functions, Worksmith and Progress Retail aim to reduce operational complexity, improve employee engagement, and enhance customer experience. According to Deloitte's 2025 Retail Outlook, 69% of retail CIOs plan to increase investment in frontline store technology to enable unified commerce and reduce attrition. The new combined platform responds to this shift by offering a fully integrated solution that supports both backend operations and frontline execution. Progress Retail's learning management and workforce experience tools ‚Äî which include capabilities such as task management, employee communication, and training ‚Äî over time will be integrated into Worksmith's service execution suite, which is already used by major global retail brands such as Burberry, Nespresso, Ferragamo, Louis Vuitton, and Tiffany & Co. Global Reach and Continued Innovation Progress Retail, which was founded in 2017 and led by Ray Riley has grown its client base internationally, with customers in North America, Europe, Africa, and Asia-Pacific. Notable clients include Fleet Feet, Faherty, Lume, in addition to Canadian brands including Pilgrim and Andrews. Importantly, all Progress Retail employees will remain with the company. This ensures continuity for current clients and is expected to accelerate product innovation across the combined platform. The Progress Retail business unit will continue operating under its existing leadership, with CEO Ray Riley assuming the new role of Vice President of Retail at Worksmith. ‚ÄúComing off a strong 2024, we're eager to deliver a unified, tailored solution for cross-functional retail leadership across facilities and maintenance, visual merchandising, retail operations, HR, L&D, and more,‚Äù said Riley. ‚ÄúWe are excited to continue our mission of simplifying retail operations with Bryan and the Worksmith team.‚Äù A Shared Vision for Future Growth Worksmith and Progress Retail say the integration will allow them to pursue expanded product capabilities and potentially other strategic acquisitions. The companies plan to cross-offer each platform to their respective client bases, and jointly market the new integrated solution to new retail brands. ‚ÄúWe are excited to welcome the Progress Retail team to Worksmith; to increase investment in the Progress Retail software platform; to offer the Progress Retail software to existing Worksmith customers; to offer the Worksmith platform to Progress Retail customers; and to market the combined solution to new, prospective customers,‚Äù said Burkhart. ‚ÄúTogether, we provide a comprehensive offering for retail operations leaders.‚Äù The joint platform is positioned as an all-in-one solution to help retailers optimize their store performance, automate key functions, and scale global operations efficiently. About Worksmith Austin-based Worksmith is a facilities maintenance and store experience management platform focused on simplifying store operations for multi-location retailers. A three-time Inc. 5000 honoree (2022‚Äì2024), Worksmith enables brands to streamline vendor management and ensure service consistency across their store networks.

On Tuesday, July 1, the pair attended a screening of Priyanka's latest film, in London. The actress, 42, and Nick, 32, shared an adorable video on Instagram of the date night, which included Nick making room for Priyanka to show off her stylish fringe gown. Priyanka wore a Burberry brown, orange and black gown from the Fall 2025 Ready-to-Wear line. The intricate gown featured sheer fringe details across the dress's bodice and again on the midi-length skirt. The gown was cinched with a black Bridle belt. Nick sported a sophisticated navy pinstriped suit with a double-breasted suit jacket and black leather Burberry Rogue loafers. After the married couple posted the collaborative Instagram video, Priyanka also added it to her Instagram Stories, and simply wrote: ‚ÄúMy ‚ù§Ô∏è.‚Äù The pair's London date night was in celebration of the actress's new film with John Cena and Idris Elba. The Prime Video film imagines Cena, 48, as U.S. President Will Derringer and Elba, 52, as U.K. Prime Minister Sam Clarke. The two ""have a not-so-friendly and very public rivalry that jeopardizes their countries' 'special relationship,' "" a synopsis reads. ""But when they become the targets of a powerful and ruthless foreign adversary ‚Äî who proves more than a match for the two leaders' security forces ‚Äî they are begrudgingly forced to rely on the only two people they can trust: each other."" Ahead of the special London screening, the couple had another chic date night at the 2025 Met Gala on May 5, marking their fourth time attending the fashionable event together. For that occasion, they coordinated their looks with the event's ‚ÄúTailored for You‚Äù dress code. The actress wore a matching white blazer and skirt with black polka dots. The Balmain look was finished with a large, wide-brimmed black hat and matching gloves. She accessorized with a jaw-dropping Bulgari necklace that featured the 241-carat ""Magnus Emerald,"" which is ""the largest faceted stone ever set by Bulgari, according to a release.

La banda m√°s representativa de britpop se separ√≥ en 2009, pero ha seguido muy presente musicalmente -sus dos primeros √°lbumes, 'Definitely Maybe' (1994) y '(What's the Story) Morning Glory?' (1995) est√°n entre los discos m√°s populares de finales del siglo XX en Spotify-, y tambi√©n en la moda, donde el d√∫o de Manchester defini√≥ un estilo distintivo 'cool' y muy 'british' que fusionaba el armario de la clase trabajadora con influencias 'mod', de aquellos j√≥venes de los 60 que escuchaban a los Beatles y se cortaban el pelo como el cuarteto de Liverpool. Los explosivos Gallagher han firmado la paz, o una tregua, y se suben juntos de nuevo a un escenario este viernes y s√°bado, 4 y 5 de julio, en Cardiff (Principality Stadium), en los dos primeros de los 14 conciertos que ofrecer√°n este verano en Europa.

Esta √∫ltima marca acaba de lanzar la colecci√≥n Festival, ""inspirada en la cultura brit√°nica de los 90 y el fen√≥meno 'cool britannia' (...), un legado que sigue vigente"", asegura la marca. La c√°psula cuenta con Liam Gallagher junto a sus hijos Lennon, Molly Moorish-Gallagher y Gene (hijos de Patsy Kensit, Lisa Moorish y Nicole Appleton, respectivamente). La herencia cultural queda asegurada, pues, en la siguiente generaci√≥n, en una campa√±a en la que tambi√©n participan otros iconos brit√°nicos, como Cara Delevingne y Alexa Chung.

La banda m√°s representativa de britpop se separ√≥ en 2009, pero ha seguido muy presente musicalmente -sus dos primeros √°lbumes, 'Definitely Maybe' (1994) y '(What's the Story) Morning Glory?' (1995) est√°n entre los discos m√°s populares de finales del siglo XX en Spotify-, y tambi√©n en la moda, donde el d√∫o de Manchester defini√≥ un estilo distintivo 'cool' y muy 'british' que fusionaba el armario de la clase trabajadora con influencias 'mod', de aquellos j√≥venes de los 60 que escuchaban a los Beatles y se cortaban el pelo como el cuarteto de Liverpool. Los explosivos Gallagher han firmado la paz, o una tregua, y se suben juntos de nuevo a un escenario este viernes y s√°bado, 4 y 5 de julio, en Cardiff (Principality Stadium), en los dos primeros de los 14 conciertos que ofrecer√°n este verano en Europa. Los nost√°lgicos de aquella √©poca, y sus hijos, la Generaci√≥n Z que adora todo lo que huela a 'vintage', volver√°n a vestirse con aquellas prendas que tan bien refleja la pel√≠cula 'Trainspotting' (1996), o que tan bien vistieron otras bandas rivales de Oasis, como Blur, The Verve o Elastica. En las ant√≠podas del otro estilo dominante de los 90, el grunge originario de Seattle que lider√≥ Nirvana, con sus guitarras distorsionadas, sus letras crudas e introspectivas, y sus 'looks' desali√±ados de camisetas amplias, pantalones ra√≠dos y camisas de cuadros, el britpop buscaba revitalizar la escena brit√°nica con un sonido m√°s optimista y mel√≥dico, una versi√≥n similar pero mejorada de las bandas de los a√±os 60.

Esta √∫ltima marca acaba de lanzar la colecci√≥n Festival, ""inspirada en la cultura brit√°nica de los 90 y el fen√≥meno 'cool britannia' (...), un legado que sigue vigente"", asegura la marca. La c√°psula cuenta con Liam Gallagher junto a sus hijos Lennon, Molly Moorish-Gallagher y Gene (hijos de Patsy Kensit, Lisa Moorish y Nicole Appleton, respectivamente). La herencia cultural queda asegurada, pues, en la siguiente generaci√≥n, en una campa√±a en la que tambi√©n participan otros iconos brit√°nicos, como Cara Delevingne y Alexa Chung.

La banda m√°s representativa de britpop se separ√≥ en 2009, pero ha seguido muy presente musicalmente -sus dos primeros √°lbumes, 'Definitely Maybe' (1994) y '(What's the Story) Morning Glory?' (1995) est√°n entre los discos m√°s populares de finales del siglo XX en Spotify-, y tambi√©n en la moda, donde el d√∫o de Manchester defini√≥ un estilo distintivo 'cool' y muy 'british' que fusionaba el armario de la clase trabajadora con influencias 'mod', de aquellos j√≥venes de los 60 que escuchaban a los Beatles y se cortaban el pelo como el cuarteto de Liverpool. Los explosivos Gallagher han firmado la paz, o una tregua, y se suben juntos de nuevo a un escenario este viernes y s√°bado, 4 y 5 de julio, en Cardiff (Principality Stadium), en los dos primeros de los 14 conciertos que ofrecer√°n este verano en Europa.

Mon concept d'interview √©tait de m'adresser √† des personnalit√©s de t√©l√©r√©alit√© comme un animateur t√©l√© pourrait le faire avec n'importe quelle c√©l√©brit√© : avec curiosit√© et consid√©ration. C'√©tait une √©poque o√π la t√©l√©r√©alit√© √©tait souvent trait√©e de mani√®re l√©g√®re et trash. Ce qui a d√©not√© au d√©but, c'est que je vouvoyais mes interlocuteurs. Je tenais cela de mes ann√©es dans le milieu du pr√™t-√†-porter de luxe o√π le vouvoiement √©tait de rigueur. ¬ª Cr√©ation de sa soci√©t√© 2ZS Production ¬´ J'ai commenc√© en autoentrepreneur jusqu'√† ce que mon p√®re me conseille de cr√©er une structure et m'aide √† monter ma soci√©t√© en f√©vrier 2017. Tous les noms qui me plaisaient √©taient d√©j√† pris. Comme nous √©tions le p√®re et le fils dans cette cr√©ation d'entreprise, c'est devenu 2ZS Production, comme deux Zirah. ¬ª Une enfance dans le sud de la France ¬´ Je suis n√© √† Montpellier. J'ai une s≈ìur a√Æn√©e et je suis tonton de deux petites-ni√®ces que j'adore, une qui vient d'avoir 15 ans et une de 4 ans. Mon p√®re est un entrepreneur dans l'√¢me, je l'ai toujours connu chef d'entreprise. Il a commenc√© de z√©ro et a r√©ussi √† cr√©er une soci√©t√© tr√®s innovante pour l'√©poque dans la gestion √©lectronique des files d'attente. Aujourd'hui, il a 140 salari√©s. J'ai toujours √©t√© admiratif de son parcours. Il r√™vait de faire ce que je fais aujourd'hui mais il ne pouvait pas car il est sourd de naissance . Ma maman a toujours √©t√© l√† pour ma s≈ìur et moi, elle √©tait √† la maison pour s'occuper de nous. Elle nous apportait beaucoup d'amour. ¬ª Une scolarit√© difficile ¬´ Comme beaucoup de timides et d'introvertis, je voulais faire quelque chose dans la repr√©sentation, je voulais √™tre com√©dien. J'ai eu mon bac L, option arts plastiques, je suis parti √† Paris un an apr√®s et j'ai fait le cours Florent. √Ä l'√©cole, je devais travailler √©norm√©ment pour obtenir des r√©sultats tr√®s moyens contrairement √† ma s≈ìur qui lisait une page deux fois et qui la connaissait par c≈ìur. J'√©tais √©pileptique de mes 7 √† mes 13 ans. Les neurologues avaient expliqu√© √† ma m√®re que mon traitement cr√©ait des probl√®mes de concentration et je n'arrivais pas √† apprendre mes le√ßons. C'√©tait tr√®s dur pour moi. Je me sentais b√™te de ne pas r√©ussir √† apprendre. ¬ª De la com√©die au monde de la mode ¬´ Je me suis rendu compte que la com√©die n'√©tait pas faite pour moi. Cela allait √™tre tr√®s difficile parce que j'√©tais plus eff√©min√© que les autres, j'avais plus de mani√®res sans le faire expr√®s. J'avais mon accent du sud. Contrairement √† d'autres, mon orientation se voyait et c'√©tait difficile de jouer les jeunes premiers quand tu n'es pas cr√©dible. En parall√®le, j'ai travaill√© dans le pr√™t-√†-porter de luxe, j'aimais bien repr√©senter et cela a plu √† l'industrie du luxe. J'ai travaill√© dans les cosm√©tiques chez Sephora, j'ai appris √† maquiller sur le tas. Puis j'ai √©t√© vendeur chez Givenchy, √ßa a √©t√© extraordinaire. √Ä 23 ans, je suis devenu directeur adjoint de trois boutiques Burberry puis directeur de ma propre boutique pour la marque Chlo√©. Au bout de quatre mois, j'ai tout stopp√©. Ce que je voulais, c'√©tait cr√©er. ¬ª Accro aux vid√©os ¬´ Quand j'√©tais petit, je fabriquais des sagas de l'√©t√© avec la cam√©ra de mon p√®re, je faisais tourner mes meilleurs amis et je les interviewais. J'avais invent√© une soci√©t√© de production qui s'appelait ZS Company. J'ai continu√© √† cr√©er des contenus en grandissant et √† faire mes petits montages. Apr√®s avoir arr√™t√© mon travail pour Chlo√©, j'ai postul√© pour la cha√Æne Non Stop People , j'ai √©t√© appel√© en plein mois d'ao√ªt, je me suis rendu √† Paris et trois jours apr√®s, j'√©tais retenu pour enregistrer le pilote du ‚ÄúJT de la t√©l√©r√©alit√©‚Äù. C'est comme √ßa que je suis rest√© trois ans sur cette cha√Æne en tant que chroniqueur. Je me suis r√©gal√©. ¬ª Un enfant de ¬´ Loft Story ¬ª ¬´ Le Loft, c'√©tait le gros ph√©nom√®ne...."

The British royal family member, who has taken on more public royal engagements since completing her chemotherapy treatment for an undisclosed form of cancer in September, spent some time speaking with staff and planting flowers in the garden. For the special outing, she opted for a select few designers for her business casual attire. The royal wore the Wind Hunter Charmer double-breasted pinstriped grain de poudre blazer courtesy of Blaz√© Milano. The stripe motif perfectly complemented Middleton's shirt. The Princess of Wales also wore the ‚ÄúCapri‚Äù striped cotton-poplin shirt in tan and white by Ralph Lauren, a designer whose suits she has also styled in the recent past. Middleton paired her shirt and blazer with a pair of chocolate brown pants with a belt. As for other elements of her attire, the royal wore a pair of metallic-trimmed leather sneakers courtesy of Veja. Her jewelry consisted of a Cartier bracelet and white gold earrings, along with a necklace by London-based brand Auree Jewelry. Ralph Lauren, a designer also worn by Middleton's sister-in-law, Meghan Markle, has several pieces featured in Kate Middleton's royal wardrobe. Last April, Middleton wore the ‚ÄúSchmitt‚Äù herringbone tweed¬†blazer¬†in olive courtesy of the American designer. The Princess of Wales wore the jacket during her joint visit to the Ardura Community Forest in Ardura, Isle of Mull, Scotland, alongside her husband, Prince William. The trip coincided with the royal couple's 14th wedding anniversary. Known for her power suiting moments and royal rewears, Middleton's embrace of the business casual style created an approachable effect for her latest solo royal engagement. The combination of the Ralph Lauren shirt with the Blaz√© Milano blazer and Veja sneakers crafted a business casual aesthetic that still catered to Middleton's approach to fashion and style.

Email tips@dailymail.com Liam Gallagher has issued a public apology to fans after sparking outrage for tweeting out a racial slur. The singer, 52, is only days away from the start of the long-awaited Oasis reunion tour, with him set to take the stage with brother Noel, 58, for the first time in 15 years, on Friday in Cardiff. However, the famously outspoken and controversial star left many of his Asian fans hurt and offended, after tweeting out the derogatory phrase 'chingchong'. The slur is¬†a derogatory imitation of the Chinese language and is used mock or denigrate people of East Asian descent. In the past both Shaquille O'Neal and Rosie O'Donnell have drawn public ire and issued apologies for using the offensive term. Liam appeared to tweet the phrase on Tuesday, responding to critics by claiming: 'it's an ancient thought process get on it', and responding to one fan warning him he'd be cancelled by saying: 'Whatever'. But he seemed to have learned the error of his ways by Wednesday, after deleting the original tweet and taking to X once again to apologise and insist¬†his use of the slur wasn't 'intentional'. He wrote: 'Sorry if I offended anyone with my tweet before it wasn't intentional you know I love you all and I do not discriminate. peace and love LG x'. However, the damage was done for many, with some less than impressed by his apology and calling his behaviour 'disappointing'. They took to social media to say: 'My friend once went to Liam Gallagher's Knebworth gig alone, and got assaulted by racists. It was never just a wrong word. It sounds okay to you because you've never been scared by people calling you racist slurs. Grown ups should know it's never right to defend racism'. 'why are so many white people defending Liam Gallagher and saying he did nothing wrong?? Just because he sang your favourite songs doesn't mean you can excuse blatant racism.' 'liam gallagher deciding to get cancelled 3 days before their first gig since 2009'; 'liam gallagher could drop a nuclear bomb and *those* oasis fans would be like ""silly liam!!! its alright he didn't know"".' 'I mean i love oasis as much as the next guy and i cant deny the fondness for Liam in my heart BUT he posts ""rastas"" like every single day as a white guy...we shoulda seen this in the cards for him'. 'who would have thought in 2025 at the ripe age of 52 liam gallagher would still consider casual racism as being edgy.' 'It's fine that Liam apologized because it's the least the offended Chinese fans deserve, but if you're not Asian you shouldn't tell Liam that there was no mistake on his part, and that his apologies aren't necessary, YES they are necessary'. 'I personally don't care for his half-hearted apologies. He clearly doesn't care when his only responses to people calling him out on his previous remarks were ‚Äúwhatever‚Äù. That really says it all.' 'Those white people who forgive Liam Gallagher for tweeting ‚Äúchingchong‚Äù certainly haven't been called by this racist, derogatory, disgusting name on the streets, multiple times, unprovoked, just for looking East Asian.' 'he was saying whatever in the replies yesterday but ig being scrubbed from a burberry campaign will do wonders for one's solemnity and reflection'. 'i appreciate the apology but the original tweet and the dismissiveness in his replies to ppl rightfully critiquing him still leave a bad taste hopefully he learns from this but it's just truly disappointing'. It comes as¬†Oasis¬†have arrived in Cardiff ahead of the first gig of their hotly-anticipated reunion tour, after a last minute change to the plans. The iconic Britpop band will perform stadium shows for the first time in 15 years across the United Kingdom, Ireland, Japan, South Korea¬†and North, Central and South America, where it will conclude with a show at S√£o Paulo's Est√°dio do Morumbi on November 23. And on Monday, fans became convinced that the duo had already arrived in Wales to sound check at the stadium after people heard music coming from inside. It has also been revealed the brothers have enlisted new bandmates for the tour, with drummer Joey Waronker and guitarists Andy Bell, Gem Archer and Paul 'Bonehead' Arthurs on board. A source told The Mirror: 'With a new lineup and it being such a huge first show, the boys will do some songs inside the venue too. 'Some tours would start with a smaller show or take a week or two to get into the groove again- but there is no time for that, and also Liam and Noel want every night to be massive. 'This is such a huge comeback show, and they are taking it very seriously, it all points to it being an incredible comeback tour.'"

Other roles included buyer for Burberry, associate merchandiser at Calvin Klein, and assistant merchandiser at Gap, where he spent nearly eight years. Neither Rizzolo nor Alexander Wang could be reached for comment Wednesday morning. In a LinkedIn post, Rizzolo said he joined Wang on Tuesday. ‚ÄúThis brand has held a place in my heart for two decades ‚Äî genre-defying, culturally sharp, relentlessly creative. To take on this role alongside Alex and lead this exceptionally talented team into a new chapter is an honor I welcome with gratitude and energy. ‚ÄúI have always been inspired by the passion that fuels founder-led brands, and I'm thrilled to match Alex's drive and dedication to the brand and the business. The next chapter starts now,‚Äù he wrote. In a WWD story in December 2023, Wang said it was searching for a new chief executive officer. The company's adviser has been Paula Sutter (former president of Diane von Furstenberg), who's been advising the brand for over 15 years. Sutter couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday. In the 2023 WWD story, Wang said he had gone through ‚Äúa complete transformation both personally, and through work,‚Äù after being accused of sexual misconduct and sexual assault in 2000. The company, which had moved into sprawling offices at 139 Beekman Street in 2023, was recommitting to its North American business. It had committed to building the bodywear category, opening freestanding stores in North America and strengthening its online business. It had also planned growth in Europe in 2024. It was reported that the company was tracking to close out 2023 with more than $200 million in global revenues. China had become its number-one market, followed by North America. 03"

mov_B8190A65D7906AA719AFEE1CA9EA609A,2025-07-03 09:28:11,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Mass layoffs continue to sweep through global industries in 2025, with technology, finance, retail, and energy giants announcing deep cuts. The reductions are being driven by a mix of cost-cutting, restructuring, and the growing impact of artificial intelligence on business models. According to the World Economic Forum, 41% of global companies expect to reduce their workforce within five years due to AI. While AI-related roles in big data, fintech, and machine learning are set to grow, many traditional jobs are being phased out or reassigned. BlackRock, the world's largest asset manager, is trimming about 200 jobs to better align its resources, while Jack Dorsey's fintech firm Block is letting go of 1,000 workers across its brands, including Square, CashApp, and Tidal. Ally Financial is laying off around 500 employees as part of a ‚Äúright-sizing‚Äù strategy, while Automattic, parent company of Tumblr and WordPress, is cutting 16% of its workforce. CEO Matt Mullenweg noted, ‚ÄúWhile our revenue continues to grow, Automattic operates in a highly competitive market, and technology is evolving at unprecedented levels.‚Äù In aerospace, Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin is laying off 10% of staff to improve manufacturing focus, while Boeing plans to cut 400 roles from its moon rocket programme in line with NASA's delayed Artemis missions. Retail is feeling the pinch too. Burberry is axing 1,700 roles after slipping into a loss, and Kohl's has reduced 10% of corporate positions amid sluggish sales. Starbucks, meanwhile, laid off 1,100 corporate staff in February. Tech continues to face a mixed outlook. Meta is targeting ‚Äúlow-performers‚Äù in ongoing cuts, Intel is slashing 15% of its Foundry workforce, and Microsoft has made multiple rounds of layoffs, with another 9,000 planned in July. Salesforce and Workday have both cut over 1,000 roles, citing shifts towards AI-focused growth. Other notable companies undertaking cuts include Disney, GrubHub, PwC, Porsche, Sonos, and UPS. Many cite operational efficiency, automation, and changing market conditions as primary reasons. The layoff trend shows no signs of slowing as companies brace for an AI-powered future and a volatile economic landscape."

Priyanka Chopra laughs about wardrobe malfunction At the Heads of State event in London, Priyanka Chopra dazzled in a bold fringe dress from Burberry's Fall/Winter 2025 collection. The full-length black, red, and brown look featured layers of fringe and a black leather belt cinched at the waist. She paired it with a new set of wispy bangs while walking hand-in-hand with Nick Jonas. But according to Chopra, the night wasn't as smooth as it looked. In an Instagram reel, the Citadel star showed off the moments fans didn't get to see. ‚ÄúI'm an actress. Of course my nail falls off right before the red carpet,‚Äù she said, pointing at her manicure missing a nail.

In the lead-up to the UK event, Priyanka Chopra also walked the carpet at the Heads of State's New York premiere on June 24. Speaking to E!

Shah Rukh Khan levitates near a beach, eating parathas with a third hand sprouting from his shoulder. A washing machine flashes its teeth. A child with neon eyes stares into your soul and says, ‚ÄúMoisturise or perish.‚Äù You swipe up. You have absolutely no idea what you just witnessed. No, this isn't a fever dream. It's advertising today. Surrealism, once confined to arthouse films and niche magazines, is now front and centre in brand storytelling. Globally, big brands are tossing the old playbook. Gucci is making its models float mid-air, while Diesel has a freakish-style house. These ads are starting to look more like hallucinations than product promotions. Burberry made a film called 'Night Creatures' where people on a night walk get picked up by a mysterious creature and float in the air. Weird, absurd, and nothing to do with the brand. [embedded content] ‚ÄúPeople are tired of seeing the same kind of content every day‚Äù, says Rohan Mukherjee, Co-founder of byooooob. ‚ÄúSurrealism feels fresh because it's unpredictable‚Ä¶ it reflects the kind of chaos we experience online and offline.‚Äù [embedded content] It's not just visual chaos for chaos's sake, it's intentional. Surrealism disorients, then delights. It mirrors the fragmented way we consume media, fast, fractured, and emotion-first. A LinkedIn column by Sami Viitam√§ki argues that ‚Äúnonsense marketing‚Äù is outperforming traditional logic-led storytelling because it allows for deeper engagement through emotion, humour, and intrigue. ‚ÄúSurrealism offers us a gateway into our subconscious, a portal into dreams,‚Äù adds Shai Samantey, Co-founder & Director at Jungle. ‚ÄúExploring these realms‚Ä¶ gives one a bigger canvas to create.‚Äù [embedded content] What is driving this shift? One reason for this visual shift is technology. AI has cracked open surrealism's gate, allowing more creators to play in dreamlike, illogical spaces. Midjourney, DALL¬∑E and Runway lets creators make bizarre visions without needing heavy design or VFX. ‚ÄúAI made surreal visuals more accessible. Anyone with an idea can create strange, dreamlike images without needing to know design software,‚Äù says Mukherjee. Samantey agrees, ‚ÄúAs filmmakers, anything in our wildest imagination can now be brought to life. AI not only helps you build your vision but also reimagines it in ways you may not have seen before.‚Äù But not everyone sees AI as the magic bullet. ‚ÄúWe are just scratching the surface. Even our most advanced AI models are nowhere near the complexity of the human brain,‚Äù says¬†Ram Madhvani, Co-founder, Director, and Producer at Equinox Films. Pranoy Kanojia, VP Strategy, Enormous Brands, adds, ‚ÄúAI has supercharged this. The aesthetics of brain rot have improved, blurring the lines of absurd and real.‚Äù There's even a name for this online explosion of weird, AI-crafted content: AI Slop ‚Äî a genre built on bizarre juxtapositions and visual overload, engineered to keep you scrolling. And young audiences, especially Gen Z, are leaning into it. Mukherjee says, ‚ÄúMostly younger audiences who are online a lot. They're used to content that moves fast, breaks rules, and doesn't always make sense on the surface. Surrealism speaks to that mindset ‚Äî it's emotional, visual, and leaves space for interpretation. ‚ÄúAt the end of the day, we are all dreamers,‚Äù adds Samantey. ‚ÄúA good piece of content that uses surrealism can be appreciated and consumed by all audiences.‚Äù Studies support this. According to a YPulse survey, 73% of Gen Z actively seek 'visually bold, weird, or unexpected' content. Data from Kantar's 2024 Creative Effectiveness Awards also adds a strategic layer, ads with 'Bizarrely Bold' visuals like Deliveroo's surreal 'Octoman' featuring an octopus on a date via delivery, consistently outperform for attention and memorability.

2722F869C3BDDDD298E1BEE346FC727E,2025-07-03 18:04:55,en,PRINT,"‚Äâ The Tasman Tanning Senior competition has reached the penultimate weekend, with four teams looking to punch their ticket to Cooks Gardens and crown a fresh champion for 2025. Defending champions the Utiku Old Boys went out on their shield at Macnab Domain last Saturday as the season's great success story, McCrea Scanning Counties, secured their away semifinal against the Forest 360 Marist Knights. Leading 17-3, Counties showed all their guile to eventually end Utiku's title reign 26-17, with their try-scorers including prop Frazer Matthews, flanker Tamati Aramoana and their marquee player, Lindsay Horrocks. Counties did lose to the Knights 40-19 in the first week of the competition, but they proceeded to lift the Whanganui Rugby Challenge Shield off fellow semifinalists Direct Connect Marist Celtic and rattle off five straight defences, before losing by one point to the top qualifiers, McCarthy's Transport Ruapehu. Celtic, in their 50th anniversary season, have come through a competitive mid-table pack to beat their Spriggens Park neighbours, the Seales Winslow Pirates, 36-19 and earn the trip up to face Ruapehu. A family-oriented team, Celtic are skippered by rugged veteran Maikara McDonnell, while first five-eighths Wineti McDonnell slotted five kicks in the quarter-final, with two tries credited between them. Prop Jeremy Seal, winger Ranginamu Lambert and centre Te Oranga Whareaitu also dotted down. It is historic to have both Marist teams in the semifinals, as the 2024 runners-up, the Knights, are determined not to be denied the crown. Their 73-16 quarter-final win over Kelso Hunterville saw No8 Brandon Burberry score a hat-trick, while standout fullback Joey Devine had 16 points from two tries and three conversions. Winger Heemi Metekingi, centre Epeli Delasau, hooker Cyprien Bernard, prop Raponi Tofa, flanker Kane Hinga and reserve Benidito Vakaruru also scored. Hosting Celtic, the undefeated Ruapehu will appreciate the upstart Border Seniors gave them more of a test than would have been expected in their 26-0 quarter-final win. Their try-scorers were flanker Taipari Wirepa, winger Tahatika Te Riaki, hooker Aaron Wilson and skipper Kahl Elers-Green. Women's competition The fourth semifinalists for the 2025 Tasman Tanning Women's competition was confirmed last week as Hunterville claimed a historic playoff spot in their first season of existence. The Rangitikei-based club side must now face the undefeated AGC Training Marist Clovers, who signalled their clear intentions after a big victory over defending champions Byfords Construction Taihape. Sitting three points behind fellow newcomers the Heidi Macaulay Realty Bulls heading into the final round-robin games, Hunterville secured their spot with a 61-0 win over the Marton Queenbeez at Marton Park. Flanker and skipper Brooke Henderson scored four tries and kicked a conversion, while second five Charlie Bennett got a hat-trick. The other try-scorers were centre Gracen Coe, winger Amoe Harawira, halfback Stacey Jones and flanker Tia Karatau-Kiu, while first five Maraea Graham slotted two conversions. Hunterville knew by Saturday that a win would take them to fourth, as Silks Audit Ratana had done them the favour the night before at Cooks Gardens by beating the Bulls 86-0. No8 Hayley Gabriel scored a hat-trick, with doubles coming from flanker Tash Kingi, centre Mikayla Heka, reserve Lexes Martin Tekoari and first five-eights Armani Martin, who also added a conversion. Ratana will now make the trek to Memorial Park to see if they can tip up Taihape. Taihape will be stinging from their 64-7 defeat to Marist at Cooks Gardens last Friday night. Second five-eighths Tiana Kauika scored a hat-trick, while fullback Alice Ireton had a 24-point haul from two tries and seven conversions. Marist's other tries were by prop and skipper Sosoli Talawadua, prop Waimarie Rauhina, No8 Lavenia Nauga-Grey, centre Awatere McLean-Wanoa and winger Kesaia Siganisucu, with Taihape's try coming from lock Leigha Stormont."

mov_486D9E815810C5AB51AE53BFBCE2AA9E,2025-07-03 23:01:03,es,WEB,"‚Äâ SPR_COMBO[es]Somos referencia obligada en Tlaxcala. Muchas personas usan el t√©rmino ‚Äúperfume‚Äù para referirse a cualquier fragancia, pero no todas tienen la misma concentraci√≥n ni duraci√≥n. Las diferencias entre un perfume, un eau de parfum y un eau de toilette no solo radican en su nombre, sino tambi√©n en su composici√≥n, intensidad y uso recomendado. Conocer estas variaciones es clave para elegir la opci√≥n m√°s adecuada seg√∫n el estilo de vida, el clima y el presupuesto. En el mercado mexicano, existe una amplia oferta que incluye desde marcas internacionales de alta gama hasta opciones accesibles y funcionales. Cada formato tiene sus ventajas dependiendo del contexto: si se busca una fragancia duradera para un evento especial, o algo m√°s fresco y liviano para el d√≠a a d√≠a. Comprender estas diferencias ayuda a evitar errores comunes, c√≥mo comprar una fragancia demasiado intensa para el uso diario. Este art√≠culo detalla las particularidades de cada tipo de producto, presenta ejemplos representativos y ofrece recomendaciones pr√°cticas para encontrar la fragancia ideal, ya sea de firmas de lujo o de marcas populares como los perfumes Aeropostale, Calvin Klein, Zara o Tous. Diferencias fundamentales entre las concentraciones Cada tipo de fragancia tiene una formulaci√≥n distinta que influye directamente en su duraci√≥n y proyecci√≥n. ¬øQu√© es un perfume? El perfume o extrait de parfum es el formato m√°s concentrado. Su contenido de aceites esenciales suele estar entre el 20‚ÄØ% y el 30‚ÄØ%, lo que le confiere una duraci√≥n prolongada, a veces superior a 12 horas en la piel. Este tipo de fragancia es m√°s costosa, pero tambi√©n m√°s persistente y sofisticada. Ejemplos comunes de perfumes concentrados incluyen Chanel No. 5 Extrait, Dior J'adore L'Absolu o Amouage Interlude Woman. Por su intensidad, se recomienda aplicarlos con moderaci√≥n y reservarlos para eventos especiales o climas fr√≠os, donde pueden desplegar todo su potencial sin resultar abrumadores. ¬øQu√© es un eau de parfum? El eau de parfum (EDP) es uno de los formatos m√°s populares por su equilibrio entre duraci√≥n y precio. Su concentraci√≥n oscila entre el 15‚ÄØ% y el 20‚ÄØ%, lo que permite una fijaci√≥n duradera de 6 a 8 horas, dependiendo del tipo de piel y las condiciones ambientales. Marcas como Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Carolina Herrera Good Girl, Montblanc Signature o los perfumes Aeropostale en su versi√≥n EDP son buenos ejemplos de esta categor√≠a. Estas fragancias son ideales para el uso diario en ambientes cerrados o para quienes desean un aroma que permanezca durante toda la jornada. ¬øQu√© es un eau de toilette? El eau de toilette (EDT) contiene entre un 5‚ÄØ% y un 15‚ÄØ% de aceites arom√°ticos. Esto la convierte en una opci√≥n m√°s ligera, con una duraci√≥n que va de 3 a 5 horas. Es perfecta para climas c√°lidos, momentos casuales o como fragancia de reaplicaci√≥n a lo largo del d√≠a. Algunos EDT populares son CK One, Versace Pour Femme Dylan Blue, Tous Touch o Light Blue de Dolce & Gabbana en su versi√≥n ligera. Son recomendables para quienes prefieren aromas sutiles y frescos que no invadan el espacio personal. Aplicaciones pr√°cticas seg√∫n el estilo de vida Cada formato responde a un tipo de uso diferente, seg√∫n la ocasi√≥n y la rutina personal. Fragancias para el trabajo y el d√≠a a d√≠a Para entornos laborales o actividades cotidianas, el eau de toilette suele ser la mejor elecci√≥n. Su ligereza evita que el aroma resulte molesto para los dem√°s, y su frescura aporta una sensaci√≥n de limpieza. Tambi√©n es com√∫n reaplicar este tipo de fragancia a lo largo del d√≠a sin saturar. Marcas como Zara, Burberry Weekend, Benetton Colors, o los perfumes Aeropostale presentan opciones adecuadas para este perfil de uso, especialmente en oficinas o ambientes escolares. Fragancias para eventos especiales Cuando se necesita una fragancia m√°s notoria y duradera, como en bodas, cenas o reuniones nocturnas, lo ideal es optar por un perfume o un buen eau de parfum. Estas versiones logran mayor permanencia y proyecci√≥n, creando una estela m√°s distintiva. Algunas recomendaciones incluyen Lancome La Vie Est Belle, Tom Ford Black Orchid, Mugler Alien o Elie Saab Le Parfum. Estos productos se comportan bien en pieles secas o en climas templados. C√≥mo identificar el tipo de concentraci√≥n Es clave revisar la etiqueta y los detalles del envase antes de comprar una fragancia. Qu√© buscar en la botella o caja Los productos suelen indicar claramente si se trata de un perfume, eau de parfum o eau de toilette. Estas leyendas aparecen junto al nombre de la fragancia, por lo general en franc√©s. En caso de duda, tambi√©n se puede consultar el porcentaje de concentraci√≥n en la lista de ingredientes. Adem√°s, algunas marcas ofrecen el mismo aroma en diferentes concentraciones. Por ejemplo, Chanel Coco Mademoiselle tiene versiones tanto EDP c√≥mo EDT, cada una con una estructura olfativa ligeramente distinta, pero fiel al ADN del perfume. Consideraciones al comprar en l√≠nea Cuando se adquiere una fragancia por internet, especialmente en tiendas mexicanas como Liverpool, Sears, Sanborns o Amazon M√©xico, es fundamental verificar la descripci√≥n del producto...."

n17ylw6,2025-07-04 00:01:28,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Well, as you should know, a large fraction--but not majority--of people here purchase luxury handbags associated with Houses that have been in the industry for a *long* time. Your brand, unfortunately, won't reach a cult following any time soon; it takes decades to build and maintain that. So I would recommend you *not* rely on logo hardware or monograms of any sort. Every brand has a ""story"". It's a marketing tactic. I recommend you come up with one, and it doesn't have to be 100% true. You are welcome to embellish. You'd be surprised what a story can do. Chanel was a dying brand until Karl Lagerfeld took over. He reinvented the lore for the dying house and made Coco Chanel seem like the pinnacle of upper class from rags to riches (while simultaneously hiding her Nazi connections). What he did for the brand is immeasurable. Anyway, yeah, a good story always helps. Pick out your niche. What differentiates you from ""other"" handbag brands? Every brand is known for *something* . I wouldn't recommend going for ""all our pieces are unique and handcrafted by the finest artisans"" or ""made with the higest quality leathers"" as that has been over done and means very little to those actually into handbags. You need to pick a group--like age range and social economic status--you wish to appeal to. Have a distinct House code/style. You want to stick out. Having themes in your collection or iconic prints will help people recognise your product from afar. Think Chanel's quilted pattern, Burberry's Nova Check print, Versace's embellishments and safety pins, etc. All these repeat features help create world building, as we call it in the fashion world. Also, social media. I can't stress that enough."
mov_744E83C09D2D2D5A64773AFAFE2BE328,2025-07-04 00:02:55,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Burberry used to be classic British, associated with royalty, the upper classes and conservatism. Not anymore. The brand has embedded itself in the heart of fashion culture ‚Äì and popular culture ‚Äì with advertising that appeals to a young trend-aware audience. Extending that push is its celebration of festival season ‚Äì because the clothes worn by pop stars and models are the clothes the young trend-aware audience wants to wear. Revolver's Kim Gehrig directs the brand's newest commercial, Burberry Festival, a candid view of the British fashion festival season and a nostalgic yet contemporary tribute to the 1990s British cultural movement known as Cool Britannia. The film intersperses new and archival footage with stills by photographer, Drew Vickers, all set to a soundtrack of Liquid's rave-era classic, Sweet Harmony. Highlighting Burberry's fashion credentials are Liam Gallagher,¬†Goldie,¬†Seungmin,¬†Loyle Carner,¬†Cara Delevingne,¬†Alexa Chung, as well Gallagher offspring, Lennon, Molly Moorish-Gallagher and Gene. The campaign highlights the enduring influence of Burberry on music and youth culture, reinforcing its position as the essential uniform for festival-goers. A highlight of the campaign is¬†Liam Gallagher wearing his own Burberry parka¬†from Christopher Bailey's 2018 Spring/Summer collection ‚Äî a piece set to be reissued in a limited run globally from July.

1lr893b,2025-07-04 03:04:24,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Hey everyone! Just wanted to take a moment to thank this amazing community, you've all helped me so much over the past few months. The passion, knowledge, and honest feedback here really guided me through my fragrance journey. In the last 4 months, I went all in tried over 150+ decants, visited a few local perfumeries, and explored and owned tons of perfume oils beyond what I'm sharing in this post. After a lot of research (and a bit of obsession), I ended up collecting these fragrances, and let's just say‚Ä¶ it became quite the addiction! That said, I've decided to hit pause and not buy any more fragrances for the rest of the year (with one exception that might arrive in the next couple of days). I'll still be around and happy to help anyone here however I can. Thanks again for being such a great part of this journey! **Note**: I am not an expert , I trust my nose more than reviews, please do research or test fragrances before you buy, I am from Middle east / Asia English is not my native language, I apologize in advance for any mistakes i try to explain this in my words without using any AI or correction tool. I am reviewing all fragrances after giving them time to mature. From Top Left to Right: 1. **Icon by Dunhill**: Really Good citrusy, Aromatic and floral scent. A good alternative for those who don't like sweet or overly citrusy scents for summer. 2. **1 Million Prive:** The most complimented one on my list, absolutely amazing winter scent with sweet and tobacco notes; I failed to find anything that can beat that fragrance. 3. **1 Million Elixir:** Very sweet and creamy vanilla with colorful floral tones, especially on the dry down. Lasts a long time and projection is strong. **4. ** ¬† **Jasoor:** Clone of VUBIR Coral Fantasy Long Lasting with Good projection, Very Versatile for year-round wear except very hot evenings. **5. ** ¬† **Asad Bourbon:** Clone that covers VUBIR Intense, Most Wanted and Stronger with you. Smells cozy and rich. Feels confident and warm. **6. ** ¬† **Khamrah :** Amazing Scent, Sweet,¬† Warm , Cozy with Vanilla and amber. 7. **Khamrah Dukhan:** I tried Liquid Burn, and to my nose, it smells quite similar that same warm, spicy DNA. But Khamrah Dukhan was much cheaper, so I went for it. It's incredibly long-lasting and feels like a spicier, less sweet version of Khamrah. If the sweetness in the original Khamrah isn't your thing, this might be a better fit. Honestly, it's underrated and didn't get the recognition it deserves from early buyers or reviewers. This one needs more attention, it's a hidden gem. 8. **Alpine Homme Sport**: Clone of Allure Homme Sport, as a Sporty scent both last 4-5 hours, and it's enough for a sports session, very good gym scent. 9. **CDN Precieux:** Clone of Aventus Absolu with Twist, Great performance and quality scent better and smoother when compared with Supremacy CE but costs more and feel more expensive **10. ** **Mont Blanc Starwalker:** absolute masterpiece a good night time / bedtime scent. Calming and relaxing, Hyped for a reason very unique scent. **11. ** **Dunhill Desire for a man:** Apple, Citrus and Rose based scent, classic cheap summer scent suitable for any age. 12. **L'Homme by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of L'Homme Lacoste, long lasting, sweet, citrusy fresh scent.

mov_5F44ADECB935A969A501A6A992416630,2025-07-04 09:45:00,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Five years ago, she knew nothing about tennis ‚Äì today, she's become a star at her boyfriend's show More than two decades ago, the term 'WAG' exploded into pop-culture consciousness. An acronym for the 'wives and girlfriends' of high-profile athletes, what began as an entertaining sports-adjacent moment quickly become thought of as a negative term. The original WAGs ‚Äì Victoria Beckham, Colleen Rooney and Cheryl Cole ‚Äì were blamed for the England football team's 2006 World Cup failure. A Spanish newspaper branded them ""hooligans with Visas"". The same media outlets that branded them poor role models also only saw them through the prism of their partners. Today, the word is being redefined through the lens of Morgan Riddle, the 27-year-old girlfriend of the American tennis star Taylor Fritz, currently rated the world No 5. She might be there supporting Fritz at every game, but she's also the star of her own story ‚Äì a woman credited with bringing tennis to a younger, female-led demographic. The New York Times called her ‚Äúthe most famous woman in men's tennis‚Äù and her TikTok and Instagram combined following totals over a million. If Wimbledon has become a less stuffy, more stylish game in the past few years, Riddle is the new poster girl for it. Her accessible social media presence and her show, Wimbledon Threads, which breaks down the best spectator looks, has become a gateway into tennis for a Gen Z and Gen Alpha audience. She sees shifting perceptions of WAGs as a goal. ‚ÄúI've always embraced the WAG thing,‚Äù she tells me on a Zoom call. ‚ÄúI knew no matter what my feelings were on it, that's what I'd be called ‚Äì so I never wanted to attach anything negative to it. Instead, I wanted to shift people's perspective on the word.‚Äù She compares the public's response to it to the divisive perception of influencers. ‚ÄúPeople immediately think 'urgh' and part of that is rooted in misogyny,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúFashion content creation is a female-led environment, so people criticise it. The same thing has happened in the WAG world, despite the fact that most WAGs are educated, run their own businesses and have good jobs. On top of that, these women also have the full-time job of supporting their partner. I'm not sure people understand and respect that.‚Äù Riddle has a way of talking about big achievements and ambitions with such lightness of touch. She might sound as peppy as a cheerleader, but she's self-aware, laser-focused and knows her self-worth. ‚ÄúPeople think of a WAG as someone who follows their partner around without having their own life,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúMaybe they're financially dependant on them. I came in swinging, really making my own name in this space, and am trying to actively contribute to the sport. I don't just take glam pictures of myself. I know for a fact that I have brought a younger demographic to the game, and a younger, female-led audience too. I've made it more welcoming for female fans. Having a purpose for everything I'm doing is very important to me.‚Äù Tennis wasn't something Riddle grew up with; in fact, she knew very little about it. She was raised in Minnesota to a family of dairy farmers where the cooler weather meant that hockey was the sport of choice. Riddle thought she'd marry a farmer and would lead a bucolic life in the Mid-West until she watched the hit show Ugly Betty. The New York-based series was a siren call for her to move to the city, so she decided to study English at Wagner College on Staten Island. When she graduated, she moved into influencer marketing for Love Your Melon, which sold hats to raise money for paediatric cancer, and latterly for Gamers Outreach Foundation, a not-for-profit that brings video games to children's hospitals. During the pandemic in 2020, she was scrolling through the exclusive dating app Raya when she connected with Taylor Fritz. ‚ÄúIn one of his pictures he was holding a koala and I just thought it was a really cute photo,‚Äù she recalls, laughing. ‚ÄúI mean, when you're swiping on dating apps it's not that deep.‚Äù She had no idea that he was a big shot in tennis. ‚ÄúIn another of his pictures, he was playing tennis but I just thought, 'Oh cute, he must have played it at college or something.'‚Äù She knew pretty fast that he had staying power after she suggested watching the horror film Midsommar as a first-date activity, and he didn't balk despite hating the genre. The pandemic meant that Fritz was on a break from his usually intense tennis schedule, so the two enjoyed a quiet six-month period where they saw each other most days. ‚ÄúThere was an instant connection,‚Äù she says. When Fritz did explain what was required of him outside of global pandemics in terms of training and travelling commitments, Riddle jumped at the chance to see more of the world. Her job at that time was remote, so she was able to work from wherever he was. She stresses that she doesn't just wait for her boyfriend in hotel rooms; when she's not watching the games, she's browsing museums, markets and trying out new restaurants. ‚ÄúI didn't travel very much growing up. We would go on spring break to South Dakota, but nowhere far-flung,‚Äù she says. ""So the idea of getting to travel the world and explore all these amazing places that the tennis tour brings us to was just amazing. I was and still am so game for it.‚Äù..."

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. It is very rare that I find myself overthinking an outfit. While I do put ample thought into what I wear‚Äîchecking the weather, getting dressed with important meetings and after-work commitments in mind, and asking myself how long I can really walk in a pair of platforms‚ÄîI'm not one to spiral like Cher in Clueless looking for her white, collarless shirt from Fred Segal, or make a mess of my room, trying on everything I own while bemoaning that I have nothing to wear! There are two exceptions, though: If I'm going to a game and cheering for a team with red, white, and blue team colors, or, if it's the Fourth of July. A few months ago, while in Philadelphia for a 76ers vs. Golden State Warriors game, I opted for a blue crop top, a white faux fur coat, and a bold red lip. I wanted to look like I was supporting the Sixers, but I did not want to look like a walking American flag; I know I'm not alone in that trepidation. American history is marred by atrocities against Black people: Slavery, Jim Crow, lynching, centuries of systemic racism that has permeated everything from public education and the justice system to housing and healthcare. All of this has transpired, and much of it continues to, despite the fact that the United States as we know it would not exist without the contributions of Black people. I was born and raised here. I could not be more proud of my ancestors. I have lived a comfortable and privileged life in America. But given all the ways the country has mistreated and disenfranchised Black people, I've never been compelled to wear patriotism on my sleeve. That sentiment is especially strong today, as I find myself increasingly enraged by this country's current political and social landscape. This Fourth of July I will likely be in black; to me, it feels more like America's funeral than its birthday. My aversion to star-spangled fashion is such that in the rare instances when it actually resonates with me, I'm wholly taken aback. There is perhaps no better example of this than my reverence for Beyonc√©'s Cowboy Carter looks. When Beyonc√© announced the release of Cowboy Carter in March of 2024, she did so with cover art that features the Houston native atop a white horse, holding an American flag, and wearing a custom red, white, and blue Busted Brand latex ensemble (fittingly inclusive of chaps), and white Paris Texas heeled boots. In an Instagram caption, she noted the criticism she faced while pursuing country music, and how she felt unwelcome in the genre's space‚Äîa space that wouldn't exist were it not for the contributions of Black artists. Sound familiar? As with nearly everything Beyonc√© releases, the Cowboy Carter iconography became fodder for polarizing public discourse. In an opinion piece for The Guardian, Derecka Purnell wrote that the ‚Äúpervasive idea that 'Black people built America' and are therefore entitled to its flag, pride, and positions of power can miss that much of what this country is and does is poisonous.‚Äù Janelle Hobson, who wrote about the visuals for Ms. and discussed them on NPR's Morning Edition podcast, ascertained that the imagery could have multiple meanings: Reclamation, yes, but also an acknowledgement of all the convictions and contradictions the American flag can stand for. Perhaps Beyonc√© is ‚Äúinviting us to wrest with the contentions between our different interpretations.‚Äù For Pop Sugar, my friend Jessican Andrews wrote that Beyonc√© is ‚Äúnot embracing Americana fashion as propaganda or using it to seek white validation, [but] taking a nuanced approach. She's honoring her Black American cultural upbringing while acknowledging the ways American ideology has been exclusionary and problematic.‚Äù Beyonc√© hasn't spoken publicly about her album cover art or the many red, white, and blue looks she's worn on the Cowboy Carter tour‚Äîand she and I aren't friends (yet)‚Äîso I can't say definitively why she has decided to lean so hard into the patriotic aesthetic. But as a fashion editor (and someone with exceptional vision) I can say that absolutely no one is wearing stars and stripes like she is. Painstakingly detailed, tailored to perfection, and rife with symbolism, the pieces that make up Beyonc√©'s current wardrobe will be remembered long after the tour concludes later this month. Since going on the road in April, Beyonc√© has worn American flag Levi's chaps‚Äîthe stars and stripes rendered in Swarovski crystals‚Äîand a shimmery USA-themed David Koma football jersey. Deftly styled by Shiona Turini, Bey donned a Coperni bodysuit with American flag bell bottoms to perform in L.A., and Burberry crystal-fringed American flag trousers in London. A red paisley bodysuit and draped overlay worn with distressed denim shorts came courtesy of Loewe, as did a checked-patterned shirt and skirt set in blue, paired with thigh-high white and red flame cowboy boots. Black designers have been integral to the Cowboy Carter story, with Beyonc√© taking the stage in pieces by Telfar, Tongoro, Ib Kamara's Off-White, and Ferragamo by Maximilian Davis. Beyonc√©'s intentionality, Turini's talent, and a trove of custom pieces by renowned houses and emerging brands have made for an aspirational red, white, and blue wardrobe. That's no small feat for an aesthetic often embraced by groups with a narrow, exclusionary view of who can claim the American flag as their own. Fans show up to the Cowboy Carter tour in thoughtful, inventive takes on Western Americana fashion, stadiums filled with denim, bandanas, cowboy hats, and looks that don't just scream U.S.A but hoot and holler. When I went to the show in Houston, I carried a paisley-embossed NDG vanity bag (red), and wore a cropped HommeGirls tank (white) with denim 3x1 x Air Force 1 Nikes (blue). In the days since the concert, a number of friends, family, and colleagues have asked me about it‚Äîmostly inquiring about the set list and the car prop malfunction. What I inevitably discuss first, though, are the clothes. They're mesmerizing in their detail and design, but also worn with a sense of confidence and joy that, while understandably hard for many to relate to, echoes an optimism that will eventually overcome today's atrocities. I believe that this both sartorial and emotional spirit lives up to some semblance of what the American flag should represent. Well, one can only hope."

urn:li:share:7345391940508524547,2025-07-04 14:09:44,en,LINKEDIN,"‚Äâ One of the biggest developments in addressable media over this year has been the rollout of AI driven targeting solutions and at dentsu  our focus this year has been to come aboard the algorithmic era exploring solutions in market from our key partners like Teads  Smart Targeting and Amazon  Perfomance+. as well as dentsu's own AI solutions. A dentsu (industry) client has even seen one of these AI solutions account for the largest share of conversions as a result of AI boosting the decisions traders have already made. Why do these solutions perform so well? Their ability to iterate... As marketers we can fairly easily create a targeting strategy for a particular brand, Burberry shoppers are very likely going to be high earners who read Tatler etc. And maybe we can think laterally to an extent as well, throw in those with an affinity for luxury cars or investment for example. But the Deep Learning models which underpin these solutions allow us to target IDs which we would not even consider and then rapidly learn and iterate based on signals, while remaining conscious of KPIs. This allows for an extremely efficient and effective method for hitting targets, and I foresee a time when the vast majority of campaigns will have an AI component as part of the initial targeting strategy. The iterative nature of the solutions means these models can provide data and insights about potential demographics for products which brands may not have even thought to consider. Will this information ever be available for brands to access? One day, for a steep price I imagine. This is the most use of data, the ability to find out what we don't know... Feel free to share your thoughts in the comments. #AI ##programmatic #digitalmarketing #tech"

Con 42 a√±os, Priyanka deslumbr√≥ con un vestido de Burberry que defini√≥ la elegancia contempor√°nea, fusionando moda y significado en cada detalle. Nick Jonas, de 32 a√±os, complement√≥ el look de su esposa con un traje azul marino y zapatillas Burberry Rogue, creando una imagen de sofisticaci√≥n conjunta que cautiv√≥ todas las miradas. Un momento cinematogr√°fico inolvidable La pel√≠cula ""Heads of State"", dirigida por Ilya Naishuller, presenta a Priyanka como Noel Bisset, una agente del MI6, compartiendo pantalla con estrellas como John Cena e Idris Elba. La trama, una comedia de acci√≥n, promete mantener al p√∫blico en vilo desde su estreno en Prime Video, seg√∫n apuntan desde People. La elecci√≥n de Chopra por papeles que desaf√≠an estereotipos reafirma su posici√≥n como una actriz vers√°til en la industria cinematogr√°fica internacional. Su interpretaci√≥n refleja no solo talento, sino tambi√©n un compromiso con narrativas contempor√°neas. La aparici√≥n de la pareja trasciende lo visual, representando un momento de celebraci√≥n que entrelaza amor, profesionalismo y glamour. Su presencia en la alfombra roja no solo atrae miradas, sino que tambi√©n amplifica conversaciones sobre diversidad y representaci√≥n en el mundo del entretenimiento. En cada paso, cada pose, Priyanka y Nick demuestran que su conexi√≥n va m√°s all√° de lo rom√°ntico: es una alianza de dos carreras exitosas que se potencian mutuamente, inspirando a una generaci√≥n que valora tanto el amor como la realizaci√≥n profesional. La noche londinense se convirti√≥ en un testimonio viviente de c√≥mo dos celebridades pueden crear momentos m√°gicos que resuenan m√°s all√° de la alfombra roja, conectando con su audiencia a trav√©s de su autenticidad y pasi√≥n compartida. Heads of State no es solo una pel√≠cula, es un nuevo cap√≠tulo en la brillante trayectoria de Priyanka Chopra Jonas, un proyecto que promete sorprender y entretener, reflejando su continua evoluci√≥n como artista global. La qu√≠mica entre Priyanka y Nick, su apoyo mutuo y su capacidad para brillar individual y conjuntamente, confirman que son mucho m√°s que una pareja de figuras p√∫blicas: son un equipo que redefine el √©xito en m√∫ltiples dimensiones."

The model, 39, and the billionaire businessman, 44, who went public with their relationship last June, shared their happy news to Instagram on Friday. Uploading a black and white snap clutching her baby girl's hand, Poppy penned: '20.05.25 The stars aligned, & then there was you.' Revealing her daughter's name, she continued: 'KAIA MOON KESWICK. Welcome to the world, baby bear. You have our hearts, our everything.' Poppy announced in January that she was expecting her first child, a baby girl, with her partner, Archie. The socialite said becoming a mother is 'all I've ever wanted,' as she shared the happy news with Elle magazine. Poppy first discovered she was pregnant during London Fashion Week when, during a fitting for a Burberry show, she noticed her clothes were tighter than usual. Sensing something was different, Poppy took a pregnancy test shortly after and then learned she was expecting a daughter. Speaking to ELLE UK in January, she said: 'Obviously, I would have been fine with either, and when I was younger, I always thought when I get pregnant, I wouldn't find out, but the second we got told we could find out, we did. I'm so excited. I come from all girls, we're very girl-heavy. Girls are great.' Poppy's sisters, model Cara, 32, and socialite Chloe, 39, were both delighted when she told them the news. She said: 'We were all in New York, with each other and with the bump, and there was a lot of talking to the bump, stroking the bump. They're just elated.' Poppy and Archie kept the news of her pregnancy to themselves for a while and only told friends and family around the four-month mark. The model previously admitted she was 'really nervous' about her pregnancy and wanted to 'protect' it for a while. She explained: 'It just feels like such an extraordinary privilege to be able to do this, to be able to have a baby at this age and at this time, and when it happened, I couldn't really believe it.' Poppy has long wanted to start a family of her own, but admitted in recent years she thought it might not happen for her and had 'made peace with it'. Poppy and Archie went public with their romance in July 2024, when they attended the BST Hyde Park festival together. Archie is the son of Simon Keswick, former director of multi-billion pound Hong Kong conglomerate Jardine Matheson - owner of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. The family has a private fortune of ¬£6.35bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, and owns an 18,000-acre estate in Angus. Now the group's interests range from prime Hong Kong real estate and brands, including the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, to Vietnam's largest dairy producer. Archie was previously described as a 'demon on the tennis court' who 'loves house music' by Tatler. The Eton-educated businessman was named as one of the world's most eligible bachelors back in 2019. Archie is no stranger to a high-profile relationship. He previously dated actress Sienna Miller, 43, who once lived with Poppy during their New York days. He was linked to Sienna after reportedly being friends for years. The actress is now in a relationship with model Oli Green, 28, and they welcomed a daughter in December 2023. Poppy was previously married to James Cook. While neither addressed the break-up publicly, they are said to have called time on their union after eight years in 2022. Before finding love with Archie, Poppy was linked to Prince Constantine Alexios of Greece, 26, in April 2023."

There was little attention on the 29-year-old heading into these Championships, the focus instead largely on Jack Draper and the assumption that he would lead the home charge over this fortnight. But Draper has succumbed to a early exit, as he did a year ago when losing to Norrie, and the thirst for British success must be quenched elsewhere. There will be no Burberry influencers in tow, the montages not quite as well-prepared, but Norrie finds himself in possession of the baton. He has made it clear he has little desire to grace Centre Court, preferring the setting and atmosphere of Court No1, and he looked at home once again in first battling and then cruising to a 7-6 6-4 6-2 win over Mattia Bellucci. There is only so long, however, that wishes can be granted. Norrie, a semi-finalist in 2022, is once again the last British man remaining in the singles draw and the spotlight cannot be avoided much longer. Nor, in all likelihood, the grandeur of Wimbledon's most hallowed ground, with a fourth-round clash to come against Joao Fonseca or Nicolas Jarry and beyond that, a potential quarter-final showdown with Carlos Alcaraz. ‚ÄúEvery single big moment you got loud and changed the momentum, it was a big factor in the match,‚Äù Norrie said in his on-court interview afterwards. ‚ÄúI've got to thank you guys for that. ‚ÄúWhen I saw the schedule I was really happy. Hopefully I can play my next match on here, I don't know. Hopefully I can play all my matches on here.‚Äù Norrie's presence in the draw deep into the second week relies on that not being the case, but the sentiment is understandable. 12th seed Frances Tiafoe, beaten by Norrie in the second round, believed the support lifted the Briton to heights he would not otherwise have reached. It was Bellucci making the early noise here, though, with close to half of the Court No1 crowd still yet to return to their seats as the Italian made a flying start. He won the first seven points on Norrie's serve, which had been so much of a weapon against Tiafoe. Norrie's game is one not built on power or flair but rather grit and dogged determination. He just about avoided falling a double-break behind, scrambling out of trouble, before breaking to love in the following game to level it up at 4-4. They remained locked all the way through to 5-5 in the tie-break, when Norrie produced the match's best point at the biggest moment. The 24th and final shot of a bruising rally was a stunning backhand pass down the line, bringing up a set point that was duly converted. Bellucci was offering up an entertaining spectacle on his own, not shy in throwing everything at a huge forehand while also fighting a regular balance battle as he slid around, at times chaotically, behind the baseline. One awkward lunge early in the second set left him bent over, hand on knee, but Bellucci's mood was swiftly improved as a backhand winner recovered the break he had given up in the opening game. Norrie restored his advantage in familiar fashion, first hanging in and then taking charge of a another long rally to break for 4-3. The Briton has spoken of wanting an engaged crowd and he got just that, the good and the bad, as he served for the set. First the rallying cries when he fell 15-30 down, the murmurs of disappointment when a first serve crashed into the net, and the groans as a forehand flew long on set point. And then, minutes later, an almighty roar as an ace out wide sealed a two-set lead. Bellucci was at his most vulnerable when in control of a point, Norrie reading a smash and hammering a backhand winner down the line to secure a break early in the third. A break of serve and, seemingly, spirit. The Italian swiftly surrendered his serve again, this time to love, and that provided Norrie with ample breathing room. He was broken when serving for the match at 5-2, but completed the job in the following game. Now a nervous wait for Sunday's order of play."

And if the tournament made them famous, it also transformed their lives off the pitch. From lucrative brand ambassadorships with high-end fashion labels such as Gucci to turns on the red carpet in dresses worthy of a Kardashian, England's female footballers now enjoy more than a touch of glitz and glamour. Once badly paid and barely recognised ‚Äì who could forget goalie Mary Earps complaining before the last Euros that Nike hadn't even bothered to print replica shirts with her name on them ‚Äì the nation's female footballers now have a soaring commercial appeal. So as they prepare to face France at 8pm tonight in their first game of this year's Euros ‚Äì and inspire a new generation of young women with their sporting prowess ‚Äì Molly Clayton reveals which of our Lionesses enjoys the most luxurious lifestyle. The Gucci model Shoots for Vogue, GQ and Elle Magazine. Modelling for Calvin Klein. Gucci snapping her up as a brand ambassador. Clearly, as well as being an impressive England captain, Leah Williamson, 28, has a catwalk-worthy fashion career too. One of the biggest earners off the pitch after leading the Lionesses to victory at the Euro 2022 final, the blonde beauty has a deal with Nike and has collaborated with global brands such as Aston Martin, Pepsi, Walkers and Mastercard. With 1.1 million Instagram followers, she has new advert partnerships with Weetabix and Cadbury, along with six children's books, titled The Wonder Team. With the deals comes the gloss: her recent lavish Mallorcan holiday to an Ikos resort would have set her back in the region of ¬£1,000 a night. She is rumoured to be dating former model and Miss USA Elle Smith ‚Äì both have posted about each other on social media. Ella the business brainbox With her ever-present fake eyelashes and love of make-up, Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone, 25, often showcases her beauty routine on her own YouTube channel. And with a canny business acumen to boot, Ella has already shaped an enviable off-pitch career. The first England women's player to trademark her name, she's set up her own brand, ET7, which includes a football academy for young girls. The name is inspired by her childhood hero, Portuguese footballing superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, whose own brand is called CR7. With some estimating her worth at more than ¬£1 million, last month she set up her own creative agency, Amicizia, which aims to connect female athletes to commercial and marketing opportunities with top brands. Her sponsors include make-up company Charlotte Tilbury, orthodontic brand Invisalign and McDonald's, with her yearly earnings estimated as upwards of ¬£200,000, fuelled by her popularity on social media. At one point, she was one of the top five most viewed athletes on TikTok. Ella has 737,000 Instagram followers and her own BBC podcast with best friend and fellow Lioness Alessia Russo, with whom she has appeared on the front cover of fashion and beauty magazine Elle. Ella loves nothing more than a red carpet bash. In a relationship with footballer Joe Bunney of Stalybridge Celtic FC, she regularly treats her fans to glimpses of their lavish holidays abroad and spa days at five-star hotels. Lauren's ooh la la lego Proving that every passion can be profitable, Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp, 24, has topped up her estimated ¬£400,000 salary with a sponsorship deal with Lego. Devoted to creating Lego masterpieces in her downtime, saying it's 'the best way to relax', she's even made the Mona Lisa out of the bricks. Her other sponsors include Nike and Sports Direct. Lauren also has the support of her girlfriend, former Liverpool midfielder Ashley Hodson. Together for two years, the pair recently enjoyed a romantic trip to Paris, where Lauren saw the Mona Lisa in her more traditional setting. Shy superstar with an ex on the team Growing up, Lucy Bronze lived on Lindisfarne ‚Äì also known as Holy Island ‚Äì off the windswept coast of Northumberland. Her grandmother was caretaker of Lindisfarne Castle and today the outline of that building is tattooed on Lucy's wrist. Shy into adulthood, she was diagnosed with ADHD and autism in 2021. But neither her isolated upbringing nor her neurodiversity held her back. Rather, she's said she uses the intense focus associated with her conditions to her advantage ‚Äì and now the 33-year-old is one of the biggest earners in the game. She reportedly took home ¬£200,000 a year while playing at Barcelona before her move to Chelsea in 2024. Big money deals followed her triumph at the last Euros, with Pepsi, EE, Klarna and Visa among her backers. Her former girlfriend is fellow Lioness Keira Walsh. Fashion week regular She earned almost ¬£2 million in 2023 alone, according to Forbes magazine. That same year, Alessia Russo's transfer from Manchester United to Arsenal made her one of the most expensive female footballers on the planet. Her contract is said to be worth more than ¬£500,000 a year and her commercial appeal is just as lucrative. She has deals with Gucci, Adidas, PlayStation, Beats by Dr Dre and last month was gifted an MGS5 EV car, which she proudly showed off on Instagram. A regular at London Fashion Week, Alessia, 26, has appeared on the cover of magazines such as Women's Health. The BAFTA TV Awards in May saw her in a ¬£1,295 Roland Mouret dress, right. Revealing outfits... on pitch too! Hair scraped back and with braces on her teeth, Chloe Kelly scored that late winning goal against Germany at Wembley in 2022, famously taking off her top in celebration. Since then, she has revelled in her success with a glossy makeover...."

The 24-year-old Chelsea player has posed in Burberry for Elle magazine and counts Nike and Extra chewing gum among her corporate sponsors. She also works with Birmingham Children's Hospital after enduring numerous eye operations as a child to cure a squint. Hannah was told she would never be a professional sports player. ' I've gone through life proving people wrong,' she said recently, words that inspired devotion among her 228,000 Instagram followers. Her relationship status isn't known. DUBAI DEVOTEE SHE never travels without her Louis Vuitton luggage, can often be seen posing in a Maybach car, and enjoys swanky trips to Dubai, staying at the luxury Five resort there. Chelsea star Lauren James, 23, has treated herself to some of the finer things in life since her key role in the Lionesses' 2023 World Cup campaign. While her relationship status isn't known, she's close to her older brother Reece, who plays for the Chelsea men's team. She has commercial deals with Nike, Google Pixel, Optimum Nutrition, Sure deodorant and Walkers. The superstar siblings often attend red carpet events together. But while she is reportedly on ¬£350,000 a year at Chelsea, Reece earns ¬£250,000 a week. KOOKY STYLE SO DEVOTED is she to tattoos that midfielder Georgia Stanway, 26, not only has around 100 of her own inkings, but she's also learned to tattoo other people.

Off the pitch, she's been with Toulouse rugby league player Olly Ashall-Bott since 2022...."

mov_BC9A4FEEB4A452B2F015FEC91BF9BA46,2025-07-05 21:00:41,id,WEB,"‚Äâ SPR_COMBO[id]Liputan6.com, Jakarta - Ketika Oasis memulai tur reuni yang telah lama ditunggu-tunggu pada Jumat, 4 Juli 2025, dengan menggelar konser pembuka di Cardiff, Wales, merek-merek fesyen diperkirakan akan merapat memberi ""dukungan."" Hubungan yang secara historis retak antara Liam dan Noel Gallagher tidak hanya akan menghasilkan pertunjukan gemilang, namun emosional. Maka itu, menjangkau khalayak luas dan memanfaatkan gelombang nostalgia Britpop tahun 90-an untuk penjualan yang lebih tinggi seharusnya dilakukan para¬†brand¬†fesyen,¬†menurut¬†kolumnis¬†Andrea Felsted, dikutip dari Bloomberg, Sabtu, 5 Juli 2025. Acara musik, terutama tur, selain perilisan album terkenal, seperti Cowboy Carter milik Beyonce dan Brat milik Charli XCX tahun lalu, telah jadi fenomena budaya. Levi Strauss & Co bekerja sama dengan Beyonce setelah lagunya ""Levii's Jeans,"" mengubah nama Instagram-nya sebentar menjadi ""Levii's"" dan meminta bintang tersebut untuk kampanye iklan. Banyak brand fesyen, termasuk Kate Spade milik Coach Inc., merangkul Brat. Sementara itu, desainer, termasuk Roberto Cavalli, Versace, dan Tiffany & Co. milik LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE mendandani Taylor Swift. Kini, para pengecer berbondong-bondong mengikuti apa yang disebut sebagai ""Wonderwall Summer.""¬† Merek mewah asal Inggris Burberry Group Plc jadi yang terdepan. Meski tidak secara eksplisit terkait dengan tur tersebut, kampanye Burberry Festival menampilkan Liam Gallagher dan kedua putranya, Lennon dan Gene Gallagher, serta putrinya Molly Moorish-Gallagher. Dorongan pemasaran ini mengingatkan¬†publik¬†pada masa kejayaan Burberry di tahun 1990-an. Kampanye terbaru memang menampilkan musisi Goldie, serta para pesohor¬†perempuan:¬†Cara Delevingne dan Alexa Chung, tapi Liam adalah bintang utamanya. Ia mengenakan parka Burberry miliknya sendiri dari tahun 2018, yang akan diterbitkan ulang dalam edisi terbatas. Adidas AG lebih terbuka dalam menarik penggemar Oasis, dengan memproduksi koleksi dari co-branded clothing, yang dijual secara daring dan di toko-toko Adidas, serta Oasisinet.com, situs resminya, dan di stadion selama tur. Di antara nama-nama lain yang terlibat adalah Levi's, yang membuat serangkaian kaus oblong, dan Stone Island milik Moncler SpA, yang menampilkan Liam dalam kampanye musim gugurnya. Band rock pria, kata¬†Felsted, berarti audiensnya beragam, yang berguna untuk penjualan pakaian pria dan wanita. Menurut GlobalData, pasar pakaian dan alas kaki pria sekitar dua pertiga dari ukuran pakaian wanita, menjadikannya peluang yang signifikan. Meski ketertarikan yang terus berlanjut terhadap segala hal yang berbau tahun 90-an telah memperkenalkan Oasis pada generasi baru, hampir setengah dari mereka yang hadir telah menyaksikan konser band tersebut sebelumnya, menurut laporan Belanja Konsumen Barclays Plc. Mengingat bahwa Gallagher bersaudara belum pernah tampil bersama sejak 2009, hal itu menyiratkan demografi yang lebih tua, yang sering kali berarti kelompok yang memiliki uang untuk dibelanjakan pada kegiatan rekreasi.¬† Ini juga membantu bahwa banyak gaya yang dikenakan band tersebut. Di antaranya adalah elana jins longgar, kaus sepak bola, dan sepatu kets low-rise yang kembali jadi tren berkat apa yang disebut estetika ""Blokecore."" Sementara Swifties mungkin telah memilih payet dan Beyhive dengan topi koboi, penggemar Oasis tampaknya berfoya-foya dengan parka dan topi bucket.¬† Meski panasnya musim panas, rata-rata¬†unggahan¬† TikTok mingguan yang menampilkan parka naik 188 persen antara 1 Juni dan 1 Juli, dibandingkan dengan bulan sebelumnya, menurut perusahaan intelijen pasar Trendalytics. Pencarian parka di pasar barang bekas Depop naik 1.850 persen pada Juni 2025, dibandingkan dengan periode tahun sebelumnya. Topi bucket juga punya daya tarik tersendiri. Menurut penelitian Barclays, hampir sepertiga penggemar yang menghadiri konser berencana mengenakan busana bergaya tahun 90-an, dan untuk mendorong perusahaan yang bekerja sama, lebih dari seperlima berencana mengenakan co-branded item. Pembelian tersebut akan menyumbang 1,06 miliar pound sterling (sekitar Rp23,4 trilioun) yang diharapkan akan dibelanjakan penggemar Oasis Inggris secara keseluruhan, menurut Barclays. Angka ini mencakup tiket, akomodasi, serta biaya makanan dan minuman. Oasis sendiri tidak selalu memiliki hubungan yang mudah dengan dunia mode. Liam memulai Pretty Green pada 2009, tapi lini tersebut diakuisisi JD Sports Fashion Plc tahun 2019. Tiga tahun kemudian, JD menjualnya pada pesaingnya Frasers Group Plc. Namun, peritel yang dikendalikan Mike Ashley tersebut tidak lagi memiliki label tersebut."

(And Potentially Save Big) The whisper of economic uncertainty is growing louder. With gloomy news headlines, rising government debt, and speculation that the Labour Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, will be increasing taxes to recoup the overspend and government borrowing, many businesses are already scrutinising every line of their expenditure. The natural instinct in times of belt-tightening is often to wield the axe, and regrettably, marketing budgets are frequently the first to face the chop. But here's a crucial warning: reducing your brand's marketing exposure should not be one of the cuts you make. In fact, it could be the most counterproductive move. Why Your Brand's Awareness is Non-Negotiable When economic headwinds blow, protecting your brand and its awareness amongst your current and potential audience becomes more, not less, vital. Diminishing your visibility risks: ‚Ä¢ Losing Market Share: Competitors who maintain or even increase their presence will steal your audience. ‚Ä¢ Eroding Brand Equity: Long-term brand building takes consistent effort. A sudden absence can quickly lead to forgetfulness. ‚Ä¢ Impacting Future Growth: Even if sales slow now, you need to be top-of-mind when the market picks up. Cutting marketing is a false economy that can inflict long-term damage far greater than any short-term savings. The key isn't to cut, but to optimise.

M√°s de tres d√©cadas despu√©s, el impacto de los agentes de inteligencia artificial (IA) se perfila como un fen√≥meno de alcance comparable. Seg√∫n especialistas de Globant, la irrupci√≥n de estos sistemas inteligentes genera un cambio profundo en las costumbres, tanto en personas como en empresas, y anticipa una nueva etapa, tan disruptiva como lo fue la llegada masiva de internet en los a√±os noventa. Herramientas como ChatGPT y Gemini aparecieron en la vida diaria en un plazo sorprendentemente breve. Su expansi√≥n ilustra la rapidez con que los avances tecnol√≥gicos redefinen h√°bitos y expectativas sociales. Estos agentes, lejos de limitarse a ofrecer informaci√≥n, habilitan nuevas formas de interacci√≥n: analizan datos, generaran contenido y ajustan sus respuestas seg√∫n las necesidades del usuario. Patricia Pomies, Global Chief Operating Officer en Globant, se√±ala: ‚ÄúEl cambio es incesante y nada indica que se detendr√°‚Äù. De qu√© manera est√°n cambiando los agentes de IA la vida cotidiana Al igual que tener un sitio web era sin√≥nimo de modernidad hace 30 a√±os, integrar agentes de IA se convierte hoy en un nuevo est√°ndar para muchas empresas y usuarios. En menos de un a√±o, asistentes virtuales empezaron a gestionar agendas, redactar documentos, responder consultas y ofrecer soluciones altamente personalizadas. Este auge responde, en parte, a la demanda de usuarios cada vez m√°s exigentes que valoran la velocidad y la capacidad de producci√≥n. Seg√∫n la consultora Gartner, los agentes de IA ya representan al menos el 15% de las decisiones laborales en diversos sectores. A diferencia de los sistemas tradicionales, no solo contestan preguntas, sino que aprenden e interpretan comportamientos, incorporan informaci√≥n y optimizan sus resultados. Pomies remarca: ‚ÄúEl cambio exponencial es que no se limitan a responder, sino que analizan, ajustan, mejoran con el tiempo y ofrecen respuestas personalizadas. Definitivamente, el nuevo avance ser√° una reconfiguraci√≥n absoluta‚Äù. Qu√© sectores econ√≥micos lideran la adopci√≥n de agentes de inteligencia artificial Los sectores que mejor adaptan estas soluciones van desde el comercio minorista y los servicios financieros hasta la industria del entretenimiento. Seg√∫n Pomies, los agentes de IA se consolidan como ‚Äúsocios estrat√©gicos‚Äù integrados en los circuitos fundamentales de la econom√≠a digital. En la experiencia de compra, Burberry incorpor√≥ espejos interactivos y herramientas de realidad aumentada en sus tiendas. Estas tecnolog√≠as permiten a los clientes probar prendas virtualmente y recibir sugerencias instant√°neas de art√≠culos compatibles. Empresas como Ray-Ban y Amazon experimentan con desarrollos basados en IA para optimizar la toma de decisiones del consumidor. Con gafas inteligentes ya es posible comparar precios en tiempo real en diferentes marketplaces, mientras que los algoritmos de Amazon anticipan las preferencias de los compradores y sugieren productos ajustados a cada perfil. C√≥mo impacta en la eficiencia y la producci√≥n los agentes de IA El crecimiento de los agentes de IA transform√≥ los procesos internos de compa√±√≠as de todo el mundo. Un banco l√≠der automatiz√≥ la conversaci√≥n de su servicio de programaci√≥n y redujo en 80% su tiempo de modernizaci√≥n. Una tarea que tradicionalmente demandaba 560 horas se complet√≥ en apenas 105. Esta mejora ilustra el potencial de la IA para multiplicar la productividad y agilizar la gesti√≥n de recursos. Sin embargo, adoptar esta tecnolog√≠a implica desaf√≠os. Tras la pandemia de COVID-19, el 85% de las industrias intentaron implementar soluciones digitales, aunque el 75% no obtuvo los resultados esperados por falta de madurez digital, seg√∫n la consultora Boston Consulting Group. La actualizaci√≥n permanente de los sistemas y la capacitaci√≥n continua aparecen como condiciones necesarias para aprovechar el potencial de los agentes inteligentes. Cu√°les son los riesgos y obst√°culos que acompa√±an este avance El ritmo acelerado de la adopci√≥n tecnol√≥gica exige a las empresas y a la sociedad anticiparse a los cambios, aunque las barreras no son menores. La curva de aprendizaje, la escasez de talento experimentado en IA y la necesidad de establecer marcos normativos y √©ticos adecuados presentan desaf√≠os urgentes. Adem√°s, la transformaci√≥n digital sigue incompleta en muchos sectores, lo que dificulta que las innovaciones tecnol√≥gicas se traduzcan en beneficios reales y sostenidos. Pomies subraya: ‚ÄúDurante tantos a√±os se ha hablado de transformaci√≥n digital, pero todav√≠a el nuevo escenario con los agentes de IA est√° asomando. A√∫n parece lejos, pero si algo hemos visto en la evoluci√≥n de internet desde Tim Berners-Lee hasta la fecha, es que todo sucede muy r√°pido y anticiparse suele ser la clave del √©xito‚Äù."

Email tips@dailymail.com New mum¬†Poppy Delevingne¬†was seen for the first time since giving birth on Sunday as she headed to¬†Wimbledon day seven with her father Charles. The model, 39, and her billionaire businessman partner Archie Keswick, 44, who went public with their relationship last June, shared the happy news to Instagram on Friday that they had welcomed a baby girl back in May. And she looked happy and healthy as she arrived for the sporting event in a flared white jumpsuit which she wore with a beige jacket. She accessorised with dark shades and wore her blonde tresses in loose waves as she posed with her father who wore a dapper navy suit. Meanwhile Andrew Garfield,¬†41,¬†and his rumoured girlfriend Monica Barbaro arrived hand in hand to the All England Tennis and Croquet Club. The American actress,¬†35, showed off her incredible figure in a strappy white top as they appeared to confirm their romance - after first sparking relationship¬†rumours in February this year. Andrew looked smart as he matched her in white and had a knitted jumper slung over his shoulders. It comes after last weekend the pair reportedly¬†packed on the PDA at Glastonbury Festival. Poppy¬†announced she had welcomed her first child with her partner Archie on Friday. She shared their happy news to Instagram. Uploading a black and white snap clutching her baby girl's hand, Poppy penned: '20.05.25 The stars aligned, & then there was you.' Revealing her daughter's name, she continued: 'KAIA MOON KESWICK. Welcome to the world, baby bear. You have our hearts, our everything.' Poppy announced in January that she was expecting her first child, a baby girl, with her partner, Archie. The socialite said becoming a mother is 'all I've ever wanted,' as she shared the happy news with Elle magazine. Poppy first discovered she was pregnant during London Fashion Week when, during a fitting for a Burberry show, she noticed her clothes were tighter than usual. Sensing something was different, Poppy took a pregnancy test shortly after and then learned she was expecting a daughter. Speaking to ELLE UK in January, she said: 'Obviously, I would have been fine with either, and when I was younger, I always thought when I get pregnant, I wouldn't find out, but the second we got told we could find out, we did. I'm so excited. I come from all girls, we're very girl-heavy. Girls are great.' Poppy's sisters, model Cara, 32, and socialite Chloe, 39, were both delighted when she told them the news. She said: 'We were all in New York, with each other and with the bump, and there was a lot of talking to the bump, stroking the bump. They're just elated.' Poppy and Archie kept the news of her pregnancy to themselves for a while and only told friends and family around the four-month mark. The model previously admitted she was 'really nervous' about her pregnancy and wanted to 'protect' it for a while. She explained: 'It just feels like such an extraordinary privilege to be able to do this, to be able to have a baby at this age and at this time, and when it happened, I couldn't really believe it.' Poppy has long wanted to start a family of her own, but admitted in recent years she thought it might not happen for her and had 'made peace with it'. Poppy and Archie went public with their romance in July 2024, when they attended the BST Hyde Park festival together. Archie is the son of Simon Keswick, former director of multi-billion pound Hong Kong conglomerate Jardine Matheson - owner of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group. The family has a private fortune of ¬£6.35bn, according to the Sunday Times Rich List, and owns an 18,000-acre estate in Angus. Now the group's interests range from prime Hong Kong real estate and brands, including the Mandarin Oriental Hotel, to Vietnam's largest dairy producer. Archie was previously described as a 'demon on the tennis court' who 'loves house music' by Tatler. The Eton-educated businessman was named as one of the world's most eligible bachelors back in 2019. Archie is no stranger to a high-profile relationship. He previously dated actress Sienna Miller, 43, who once lived with Poppy during their New York days. He was linked to Sienna after reportedly being friends for years. The actress is now in a relationship with model Oli Green, 28, and they welcomed a daughter in December 2023. Poppy was previously married to James Cook. While neither addressed the break-up publicly, they are said to have called time on their union after eight years in 2022. Before finding love with Archie, Poppy was linked to Prince Constantine Alexios of Greece, 26, in April 2023."

Poppy first discovered she was pregnant during London Fashion Week when, during a fitting for a Burberry show, she noticed her clothes were tighter than usual. Sensing something was different, Poppy took a pregnancy test shortly after and then learned she was expecting a daughter. Speaking to ELLE UK in January, she said: 'Obviously, I would have been fine with either, and when I was younger, I always thought when I get pregnant, I wouldn't find out, but the second we got told we could find out, we did. I'm so excited. I come from all girls, we're very girl-heavy. Girls are great.' Poppy's sisters, model Cara, 32, and socialite Chloe, 39, were both delighted when she told them the news. She said: 'We were all in New York, with each other and with the bump, and there was a lot of talking to the bump, stroking the bump. They're just elated.' Poppy and Archie kept the news of her pregnancy to themselves for a while and only told friends and family around the four-month mark. The model previously admitted she was 'really nervous' about her pregnancy and wanted to 'protect' it for a while. She explained: 'It just feels like such an extraordinary privilege to be able to do this, to be able to have a baby at this age and at this time, and when it happened, I couldn't really believe it.' Poppy has long wanted to start a family of her own, but admitted in recent years she thought it might not happen for her and had 'made peace with it'. Poppy and Archie went public with their romance in July 2024, when they attended the BST Hyde Park festival together. Archie is the son of Simon Keswick, former director of multi-billion pound Hong Kong conglomerate Jardine Matheson - owner of the Mandarin Oriental Hotel Group."

Anfang Juni berichtete WWD, dass Coty erw√§gt, seine Verbraucher- und Prestige-Divisionen zu ver√§u√üern, darunter einige der bekanntesten Marken von Beauty wie Covergirl sowie Chlo√©- und Hugo-Chef-Parfums. Die Ank√ºndigung versetzte den Aktienkurs von Coty 13 Prozent auf 5 USD; Die Ver√§u√üerung beider Waffen w√ºrde im Wesentlichen mehr als 120 Jahre als Unternehmen beendet. Coty lehnte es ab, sich zu dem Bericht zu √§u√üern. Trotz seiner Gr√∂√üe und Stall bekannter Namen hat das amerikanische Konglomerat in den letzten Jahren Schwierigkeiten, mit seinen Konkurrenten Schritt zu halten. Innerhalb des Portfolios seines gr√∂√üten Anteilseigners Jab Holdings ist Coty das schlechteste Kapital und senkt den Ausblick im letzten Gesch√§ftsjahr, wobei weitere Umsatzr√ºckg√§nge projiziert werden. Coty hat versucht, sein Ansehen zu verbessern. Seit seinem derzeitigen CEO Sue Nabi im Jahr 2020 eintraf, hat das Unternehmen das Fett getrimmt und nicht-Kernmarken wie Professional Lines Wella und OPI abgebrochen. Aber es bleibt immer noch seine √§u√üeren Kollegen wie L'Or√©al und Elf Beauty zur√ºck, und im Mai verkaufte es Skkn von Kim, der Prestige-Hautpflegemarke, an seinen Gr√ºnder zur√ºck, den Multi-Hyphenate-Reality-Star Kim Kardashian und ihre Bekleidungsfirma Skims, nachdem die Marke vers√§umt hatte, mit Schaufenster f√ºr Furore zu machen. Die Kerngesch√§fte, Duft- und Drogerie -Make -up, stehen ebenfalls unter Druck. W√§hrend der Duft die kategorische Kategorie der Branche ist und Coty einige der weltweit bekanntesten D√ºfte der Welt herstellt, ist der heftig wettbewerbsf√§hige Sektor mit neuen Herausforderern gef√ºllt. Die Bem√ºhungen, das Summen wie trendige K√∂rpermists f√ºr Calvin Klein und die Wiederbelebung von Marc Jacobs Beauty zu f√∂rdern, sind in einem von Nischenspieler und Tiktok -Viralit√§t dominierten Markt ein R√ºckgang des Ozeans. Die Drogerie -Marken haben ebenfalls unterdurchschnittlich geschafft. ‚ÄúSo ziemlich alles in der Messe hat nicht funktioniert ‚Ä¶ Ich gebe ihnen viel Anerkennung daf√ºr, dass sie kreativ sind und Dinge ausprobieren‚Äù, sagte Lauren Lieberman, Gesch√§ftsf√ºhrer bei Barclays Consumer Practice, in der Bem√ºhungen zur Wiederbelebung von Covergirl. Sie bemerkte auch die ged√§mpfte Wiederbelebung der Philosophie, die Hautpflege und die Bade- und K√∂rperlinie, die ein gro√üer Erfolg in den Aughts sowie die Sun Care Line Lancaster war. Mit dem R√ºcktritt von Jab Holdings 'langj√§hriger Vorsitzender Peter Harb im April wird neue F√ºhrung wahrscheinlich f√ºr ein neues Denken bereit sein. Wenn Coty versucht, K√§ufer von Gerichts zu nehmen, sind potenzielle Bieter schlank und w√ºrden wahrscheinlich in einige ausgew√§hlte Kategorien fallen. bricht zusammen, wer interessiert sein k√∂nnte ‚Äì und warum ‚Äì unten. Die Kronjuwelen Prestige -Duft bleibt Cotys hei√üeste Eigenschaft. Es enth√§lt langfristige Lizenzen f√ºr Chlo√©, Gucci, Hugo-Chef und Calvin Klein, einige der ber√ºhmtesten Modeh√§user der Welt. Hugo -Chef wird als die gr√∂√üte Marke des Unternehmens angesehen, die rund 10 Prozent oder rund 585 Millionen US -Dollar in H√∂he von rund 9 Prozent und 7 Prozent des Gesamtumsatzes des Unternehmens umfasst. Dies sind w√ºnschenswerte Verm√∂genswerte, selbst mit intensiver Konkurrenz durch Inseln auf dem Weg. Diese D√ºfte des Modehaus sind weit verbreitet, bekannt und haben ein integriertes Prestige und Dynamik. Ein Spezialist f√ºr Duftlizenzspezialist wie Interphlum, das f√ºr Lacoste und Anna Sui Parfums herstellt, k√∂nnte theoretisch interessiert sein. Seit 2022 hat es DKNY wiederbelebt und die Linie neu anspricht, nachdem LVMH sie an die G-III-Gruppe, ein Modeportfoliounternehmen, abgeladen hatte. Das spanische Konglomerat Puig k√∂nnte auch ein Anw√§rter sein; W√§hrend es sein Vertrauen in die Lizenzierung verringert hat und sich stattdessen auf den Besitz von Marken ver√§ndert hat, nachdem sie Byredo und Charlotte Tilbury aufgenommen haben, verwaltet es geschickt √§hnliche Modehaus-Duftmarken wie Carolina Herrera und Jean-Paul Gaultier und k√∂nnte dazu beitragen, dass die Marken frische Energie injizieren k√∂nnten. Mode -Lizenzunternehmen wie Tapestry, PVH Corp oder Capri k√∂nnten auch daran interessiert sein, ihre Best√§nde zu diversifizieren und dem Mix Sch√∂nheit zu verleihen, insbesondere f√ºr bew√§hrte Linien wie Burberry und Calvin Klein, von denen letztere das Modegesch√§ft besitzt. Der Luxusmarken ' Mutterunternehmen m√∂chten m√∂glicherweise auch ihre Sch√∂nheitsangebote wieder in Haus bringen. Der Gucci-Besitzer Kering hat kein Geheimnis aus seinen lauwartigen Gef√ºhlen gegen√ºber der Gucci-Sch√∂nheitsmarke unter Cotys Besitz, die 2028 abl√§uft, kein Geheimnis gemacht, und Kering hat jetzt eine interne Sch√∂nheitsabteilung mit Creed. LVMH, dem Marc Jacobs geh√∂rt, hat sich als Expertise in Beauty bew√§hrt und Sch√∂nheitsangebote wie Dior und Guerlain verwaltet. ‚ÄûDie Tatsache, dass Coty gedauert hat [as a company] So lange ist, weil Duft ein so gro√üartiges Gesch√§ft ist ‚Äú, sagte Lieberman. In j√ºngerer Zeit beginnen Unternehmen wie LVMH und KERING ihre eigenen Sch√∂nheitswaffen oder konsolidieren ihre Bem√ºhungen auf andere Weise. Lieberman sagte, andere Firmen wie Puig oder Fashion Lizenzierh√§user k√∂nnten alle logische Bieter sein, aber das Reiben ist, dass Cotys F√§higkeit, diese Lizenzen zu verkaufen, nicht eindeutig ist. Abh√§ngig von der Art der unterzeichneten urspr√ºnglichen Vereinbarungen k√∂nnen sie m√∂glicherweise das Eigentum an ein neues Unternehmen √ºbertragen. Massenbeschwerde Cotys Sortiment an Massenmarken wie Rimmel und Covergirl hat eine Namenserkennung, aber das Wachstum hat stagniert, da sie Marktanteile an schneller bewegende Indies wie Elf Beauty und Kiko Milano abgeschlossen haben. Sally Hansen ist laut Nielsen-IQ-Daten die gr√∂√üte Massennagelmarke der USA mit einem Marktanteil von 38 Prozent, obwohl der Umsatz auch gesunken ist, da die Verbraucher l√§nger anhaltende Behandlungen priorisieren. W√§hrend die Massenmarken von Coty oft unter den Top 10 rangieren, ist der Drogeriekanal in den USA insgesamt weniger lukrativ geworden, da die Auswahl der Marken und im Gesch√§ftserfahrung nicht mit Amazon und zunehmend Tiktok-Shop konkurrieren. Es ist unwahrscheinlich, dass ein strategischer K√§ufer eine so durchdrungene Marke mit niedrigem Wachstumskaderraum √ºbernehmen m√∂chte, aber Private Equity k√∂nnte f√ºr die Herausforderung stehen, insbesondere wenn er internationale M√∂glichkeiten f√ºr die Marken sieht. Solche Carve-Outs sind nicht ungew√∂hnlich in der Sch√∂nheit, sondern konzentrieren sich h√§ufig auf Prestige-Marken: Private Equity Firm Advent Creecting im Jahr 2022, um Bareminerals, Buxom und Laura Mercier von Shiseido zu kaufen, w√§hrend Coty einige seiner professionellen Marken, einschlie√ülich Wella Company, im Jahr 2020 zum Private Equity-Unternehmen KKR abfuhr. Coty besitzt auch einige in Brasilien ans√§ssige K√∂rperpflege -Linien wie Bozzano, Monange, Paixao und Risiken, was f√ºr einen inl√§ndischen Spieler wie den fr√ºheren Aesop und Avon -Besitzer Natura mit seinem Heimatvorteil von Interesse sein k√∂nnte. Unabh√§ngig davon, welcher Weg es weitergibt, ist eine Neukalibrierung wahrscheinlich bei Coty erforderlich. Und K√§ufer achten Sie auf-selbst die bekanntesten Marken von Beauty k√§mpfen darum, ein sinnvolles Wachstum in einer so wettbewerbsf√§higen Landschaft zu erzielen. ‚Äú[Coty's] Marken sollten relevant sein, aber es ist drau√üen √ºberf√ºllt ‚Äú, sagte Lieberman.

The two-day ‚Äútakeover‚Äù of Southgate station generated ¬£80,000 for TfL and included branded roundels, themed Tannoy announcements, digital screen messages and flash mobs. Bond Street was briefly renamed ‚ÄúBurberry Street‚Äù by the fashion brand to mark London Fashion Week in October 2023. However this led to 57 complaints to TfL, relating mainly to concerns about passengers becoming confused by the mock Tube signs. Last year, Old Street became ‚ÄúFold Street‚Äù to promote Samsung's ‚ÄúFold and Flip‚Äù smartphones, generating ¬£250,000 for TfL. At the time, Transport For All, which represents passengers with disabilities, raised concerns about the Tube becoming a ‚Äúwild-west PR playground‚Äù. One of the most lucrative Tube branding deals was the ¬£830,000 TfL received from Galaxy when it allowed the Circle line to feature in a ‚Äúreimagined‚Äù version of Harry Beck's classic Tube map in January 2024. But the five-year IFS Cloud sponsorship of the cable car ‚Äì which crosses the Thames between the Royal Docks and North Greenwich ‚Äì may be the best baseline indicator of the kind of deal TfL will be hoping to secure in return for allowing a firm to add its name as a prefix to the Waterloo & City line. The cable car sponsorship is worth ¬£2.1m ‚Äì but the Waterloo & City line boasts tens of thousands of commuters each day as a ‚Äú captive audience‚Äù - rather than day-trippers and foreign tourists. The Waterloo & City line first opened in 1898 and was only the second electric line on the Underground. Passenger access to the platforms at Bank station ‚Äì originally known as City - was by a lengthy sloping subway, which is believed to have led to the nickname The Drain. The walkway was upgraded to have moving walkways in 1960. The 48-hour rebranding of the Circle line was done by Samsung to promote its S24 Ultra phone. There were advertising displays at Victoria, Blackfriars, Liverpool Street, Paddington and Westminster stations and ‚Äúa complete domination of Kings Cross St Pancras‚Äù. TfL said the campaign was ‚Äúhugely popular, receiving rave reviews and has been nominated for numerous awards‚Äù. Amazon Prime paid TfL ¬£250,000 in 2020 to rebrand Piccadilly Circus station as Picardilly Circus for 48 hours to promote the Star Trek spin-off series, Picard. The station name was changed to Picardilly on all line maps and platform roundels to create an ‚Äúimmersive experience‚Äù for passengers. There were also themed Tannoy announcements in the voice of Captain Jean Luc Picard and an advertising domination throughout the station. The promotion was widely covered by the news media and even featured on The Graham Norton Show. It also won the 'Most Spectacular' award at the Drum Out of Home Awards. In 2020, Sony replaced the roundels outside Oxford Circus station with PlayStation symbols for 48 hours to promote the launch of the PS5.

One of the most lucrative Tube branding deals was the ¬£830,000 TfL received from Galaxy when it allowed the Circle line to feature in a ‚Äúreimagined‚Äù version of Harry Beck's classic Tube map in January 2024. But the five-year IFS Cloud sponsorship of the ‚Äì may be the best baseline indicator of the kind of deal TfL will be hoping to secure for the Waterloo & City line. The cable car sponsorship is worth ¬£2.1m ‚Äì but the Waterloo & City line boasts tens of thousands of commuters each day as a ‚Äú captive audience‚Äù, rather than day-trippers and foreign tourists. The rebranding of the 42nd Street Shuttle by the Metropolitan Transport Authority in New York is said to have inspired the idea for the Waterloo & City line. and was only the second electric line on the Underground. Passenger access to the platforms at Bank station ‚Äì originally known as City station - was via a lengthy sloping subway, which is believed to have led to the nickname The Drain. The walkway was upgraded with moving walkways in 1960. The 48-hour rebranding of the Circle line was done by Samsung to promote its S24 Ultra phone. There were advertising displays at Victoria, Blackfriars, Liverpool Street, Paddington and Westminster stations and ‚Äúa complete domination of Kings Cross St Pancras‚Äù. TfL said the campaign was ‚Äúhugely popular, receiving rave reviews and has been nominated for numerous awards‚Äù. Amazon Prime paid TfL ¬£250,000 in 2020 to rebrand Piccadilly Circus station as Picardilly Circus for 48 hours to promote the Star Trek spin-off series, Picard. The station name was changed to Picardilly on all line maps and platform roundels to create an ‚Äúimmersive experience‚Äù for passengers. There were also themed Tannoy announcements in the voice of Captain Jean Luc Picard and an advertising domination throughout the station. The promotion was widely covered by the news media and even featured on The Graham Norton Show. It also won the 'Most Spectacular' award at the Drum Out of Home Awards. In 2020, Sony replaced the roundels outside . Inside the station, PlayStation symbols featured on line maps and special vinyls across all six platforms. At four other stations, large-scale graphics were installed featuring the name of the station changed to reference a PS5 game, such as Ratchet and Clankaster Gate and Miles End.

In a post on the social media platform LinkedIn, announced it was offering ‚Äúexclusive sponsorship‚Äù of the Waterloo and City line, which connects and Waterloo stations. The two-stop, three-minute shuttle service, which is only open on weekdays, is London's least-used line, but still ferries around 15 million people each year. TfL said the opportunity to sponsor the line would not involve renaming it but would ‚Äúgo far beyond a typical media opportunity‚Äù. They said the sponsorship would include ‚Äúfull-line branding, from moquette seat fabric and signage to maps and experiential spaces‚Äù. ‚ÄúMillions of professionals and decision-makers travel this route every year,‚Äù the advert read. ‚ÄúNow, your brand can own the journey.‚Äù While this would be the first time an entire Tube line has been offered for sponsorship, several stations have been sponsored. Southgate station was temporarily renamed ‚Äú‚Äù Tube station by Visa in honour of the then-England manager after the national team made the semi-final of the 2018 World Cup. The two-day takeover of the final stop on the Piccadilly line generated ¬£80,000 for TfL. The sponsorship included branded roundels, themed Tannoy announcements, digital screen messages and flash mobs. A few years later, during London Fashion Week in October 2023, Bond Street was briefly renamed ‚ÄúBurberry Street‚Äù. The name change led to 57 complaints to TfL as passengers complained about becoming confused by the mock Tube signs. Complaints were also made last year when Samsung renamed Old Street to ‚ÄúFold Street‚Äù to promote their new ‚ÄúFold and Flip‚Äù smartphone, generating ¬£250,000 for TfL. The only time that a public transport line in London has been completely sponsored is the ¬£2.1 million five-year IFS Cloud sponsorship of the cable car, which crosses the Thames between the Royal Docks and North Greenwich. The Waterloo and City line, however, boasts 10 times the number of annual users."

En cambio, piensan en silencio, escritura sagrada y autorreflexi√≥n. El inter√©s por el #MonkMode est√° en auge en Estados Unidos, y los conventos y monasterios se est√°n llenando de mujeres que, siguiendo el ejemplo de Piper Ratliff de White Lotus , est√°n reservando retiros espirituales. Originalmente, el #MonkMode ten√≠a su lugar en la manosfera, donde los hombres recurr√≠an a principios mon√°sticos de abstinencia como forma de superaci√≥n personal. Pero ahora, las chicas tambi√©n est√°n participando. La usuaria de TikTok MC, quien ha ganado seguidores documentando sus ‚Äúside quests‚Äù, fue mencionada por Bustle al declarar que su monasterio cat√≥lico favorito en el norte del estado de Nueva York ya estaba completamente reservado para la temporada. Usualmente, ‚Äúsolo le mandas un correo a las monjas‚Äù, pero este a√±o tuvo que entrar a lista de espera. Monk Mode: la nueva tendencia de TikTok para las chicas este verano (TikTok) Hist√≥ricamente, los monasterios y conventos han servido como escenarios de met√°foras aterradoras sobre el patriarcado en pel√≠culas de terror. En 2024, Sydney Sweeney interpret√≥ a la hermana Cecilia, una joven monja estadounidense que se une a un convento remoto en Italia en la pel√≠cula Immaculate. Ese mismo a√±o, The First Omen mostr√≥ a mujeres tomando los h√°bitos con consecuencias igual de escalofriantes. Te explicamos qu√© es #MonkMode (Neon/Shutterstock/Neon/Shutterstock) Pero en 2025, estos espacios est√°n siendo tratados como centros de bienestar. En TikTok, las mujeres est√°n trazando una l√≠nea ‚Äîo mejor dicho, construyendo un castillo amurallado‚Äî entre ellas y las exigencias de la vida diaria, al tomar retiros silenciosos en conventos y monasterios. Y no se trata solo de buscar espacios libres de hombres (MC aclar√≥ que est√° ‚Äúenamorada‚Äù y tiene novio, pero ‚Äúcuando el monasterio llama, simplemente tienes que responder‚Äù). Publicaciones como The Cut y Bustle sugieren que las mujeres se sienten atra√≠das por todo, desde la idea de una vida m√°s comunitaria hasta la oportunidad de reducir el tiempo frente a las pantallas o encontrar inspiraci√≥n para la decoraci√≥n de interiores. Hay un tipo de minimalismo extremo, al estilo Marie Kondo , en algunas de las estancias mon√°sticas que aparecen en TikTok. Levantarse muros de ladrillos dobles entre una y el mundo exterior con la esperanza de encontrar paz interior tiene sentido, considerando que hoy en d√≠a hay demasiadas formas de ser contactadas. Las apps en nuestros tel√©fonos, desde Rappi, Justo hasta Uber Eats, nos mandan notificaciones push constantemente, y nuestros DMs son un enjambre de actividad. Entrar en un espacio donde mirar el celular se considera casi una ofensa espiritual parece ser nuestra mejor opci√≥n para lograr un retiro tecnol√≥gicamente silencioso. Sin embargo, este auge de lo mon√°stico no solo ha sido evidente en nuestras redes sociales y agendas de viaje. Tambi√©n ha llegado a las pasarelas y a nuestros cl√≥sets. Algunas de las tendencias m√°s importantes del a√±o incluyen el Castlecore (predicho por Pinterest), junto con el medieval core (y su versi√≥n Medieval Y2K Core, inspirada en Ella Enchanted). Como se√±al√≥ Vogue, marcas como Zoe Gustavi, Christopher Esber, Fendi, Ulla Johnson y Alberta Ferretti hicieron referencias al claustro en sus colecciones oto√±o/invierno, mientras que Burberry fue m√°s all√° y envi√≥ a un caballero medieval directo a la pasarela. M√°s all√° de las pasarelas internacionales, marcas independientes como la australiana Catholic Guilt ‚Äîque visti√≥ a Julia Fox en su reciente visita a Australia‚Äî y J'adorable est√°n conquistando la escena nocturna. Dado el clima pol√≠tico actual, en el que los individuos m√°s corruptos de nuestra sociedad parecen tener el mayor poder y visibilidad, la idea de una especie de guerra espiritual y un retiro hacia el ascetismo (lejos de todo lo relacionado con la boda de Bezos y S√°nchez) tiene bastante sentido. Este art√≠culo fue publicado por primera vez en ELLE AUS ."

La firma da una nueva muestra de ello con su campa√±a ‚ÄúFestival‚Äù, en la que conecta con la temporada de festivales de m√∫sica, el legado cultural brit√°nico y todo el estilo de vida que se ha generado alrededor de estos eventos. Ideada in-house y con producci√≥n de Somesuch, la campa√±a capitaliza la nostalgia y la est√©tica propia de la d√©cada de los a√±os 90, en lo que se denomin√≥ el movimiento ""Cool Britannia"", ante un verano marcado a nivel social y cultural por el emblem√°tico festival Glastonbury y la gira de reencuentro de Oasis. La pieza audiovisual principal est√° dirigida por Kim Gehrig y est√° protagonizada, entre otros, por los m√∫sicos Liam Gallagher y Goldie, o las modelos Alexa Chung y Cara Delevingne. Im√°genes de archivo y otras contempor√°neas se mezclan al ritmo del tema ‚ÄúSweet Harmony‚Äù, de Liquid, un cl√°sico de la m√∫sica electr√≥nica. La campa√±a supone una visi√≥n nost√°lgica, pero aut√©ntica de la temporada de festivales en Reino Unido y el papel que desempe√±a la moda, concretamente la propuesta de Burberry. La marca evidencia c√≥mo forma parte del tejido social del pa√≠s y su influencia en la m√∫sica y la cultura destacando su presencia, no s√≥lo entre los asistentes a los eventos, sino tambi√©n entre los artistas protagonistas.

Adem√°s de la pieza audiovisual principal, la campa√±a incluye una serie de piezas cortas para redes sociales protagonizadas por los m√∫sicos, modelos y artistas que dan vida al mensaje de la marca. Se crea con ello un ""collage"", una combinaci√≥n de retratos que reflejan la vida, el ambiente y las emociones de los festivales. La campa√±a se completa, adem√°s de con fotograf√≠as que destacan las prendas que pueden ser id√≥neas para disfrutar de un festival, con contenido que profundiza en el v√≠nculo entre Burberry, la m√∫sica y la cultural popular brit√°nica."

Both the blue-chip FTSE 100 and the domestically focussed mid-cap index were flat by 1000 GMT U.S. told 14 nations on Monday, including Japan and South Korea, that they face 25% tariffs from the new deadline of August 1, but also hinted at opportunities for further negotiations. Britain and Vietnam remain the only nations to have struck a deal and avoid the new levies, which are separate from existing tariffs on autos, steel and aluminium. Sectoral gains were led by precious metal mining stocks, which rose 2.3% as gold prices remained steady, with Hochschild adding 4.1%, while Fresnillo and Endeavour Mining gained 2.5% and 1.6%, respectively. Industrial metals also rose with copper prices edging higher. Glencore was up 2.9%, while Anglo American and Antofagasta were marginally up. On the flipside, personal goods index fell 1.5%, weighed down by luxury brand Burberry dropping over 2%. Among individual stocks, Victrex was the bottom performer on the midcap index. The polymer manufacturer's shares fell 8.7% after it appointed a new CEO and gave a tepid second-half profit outlook. Meanwhile, mining giant Rio Tinto's yet-to-be-named CEO should be open to merger and acquisition deals along with sharpening productivity and cost cuts, sources told Reuters. The news gave mining shares a marginal boost. Fast fashion retailer Shein has filed for an IPO in Hong Kong to accelerate its listing process and pressure Britain's regulators to approve its London debut, the Financial Times reported on Tuesday.

The Britannic Explorer, operated by Belmond, the LVMH-owned hospitality brand behind some of the world's most iconic trains and hotels, now turns its attention to the heart of Britain. From the end of the month, travellers will be able to enjoy an unforgettable experience that will take them through the heart of the British countryside in pure, slow-travel style. The brand behind the legendary Venice Simplon-Orient-Express and the much-loved sleeper through the Scottish Highlands has spared neither coin nor corner to create an experience as indulgent as it is memorable: a journey designed to make travellers feel no less privileged than had they boarded the now-decommissioned Royal Train. ¬© Belmond If you want to truly pamper yourself while watching Cornwall's cliffs, Welsh valleys, and Lake District hills roll by, this is for you. Provided, of course, you have pockets deep enough. With journeys starting at ¬£11,000 (‚Ç¨13,000), the three-night experience includes not just your cabin, but all meals, excursions, wine, and other beverages. Departing from London to three key regions, the journey includes curated off-board excursions such as coastal sailing and yoga by the sea, wild swimming, lavender farm visits, wood-fired saunas in Wales, and even a night at Belmond's Cadogan Hotel in London. Gary Franklin, Belmond's VP of Trains and Cruises, calls it a truly unique experience, 'an opportunity to discover the rugged Cornish coastline, Snowdonia's untamed National Park and the vast expanses of the Lake District like never before'. And if stepping off the train sounds optional, that's because the onboard world is an experience in itself. The Britannic Explorer features three Grand Suites and fifteen Double Suites, along with a spa, a cocktail bar, and a dining experience led by Michelin-starred chef Simon Rogan, known for his farm-to-fork ethos and reverence for seasonal British ingredients. His menus change with the landscape, drawing inspiration from the regions the train passes through. ¬© Belmond 'I hope every passenger not only enjoys the flavours but also feels a connection between the dishes and the journey,' Rogan said. ' Each plate will reflect Britain's diverse landscapes.' But it's not just your taste buds that will be pampered. The interiors, classic in tone, conjure an atmosphere that feels like a full Burberry meets Laura Ashley meets Ashley Hicks‚Äâ‚Äì‚Äâor in other words, the very best of British elegance, comfort, and quirk. Designed by London-based studio Albion Nord, the train brings together some of the UK's most distinctive contemporary artisans. ¬© Belmond Designers such as Luke Edward Hall, Mel Campion, and Olly Fathers have each added their touch: whimsical wallpaper reinterpreting botanical patterns and travel motifs; shell-adorned mirrors in the powder rooms; bold contemporary panels in the Grand Suites. Wool, velvet, wood, brass, and stone are used to echo the natural landscapes rolling past the windows. It's a space that feels rich yet relaxed, familiar yet rare. ¬© Belmond There's movement and mood woven into every corner. Paintings by Sarah Woods in the Wellness Suite soothe with muted coastlines; the dining car comes alive with Ed Burke's joyful dancing figures and Adam Hall's layered, hand-dyed panels inspired by algae and lichen. Even the lighting has a story‚Äâ‚Äì‚Äâdesigned by Rose Uniacke to cast a warm, domestic glow over the carriages. ¬© Belmond And should you want a moment to sip a G&T, Negroni, or something rarer, the bar carriage awaits, perfect for aperitifs, digestifs, or simply contemplating life as fields, hedgerows, cliffs, and castle ruins glide silently by. The Royal Train may have made its final stop, but with the Britannic Explorer, a new crown jewel is on the rails. Stylish, spoiling, and steeped in storytelling, it's the kind of train you secretly hope will never reach its final station."

Waterloo station (c) ianVisits Although TfL has often offered station takeover campaigns where an advertiser can effectively buy up all the advertising spaces in the station, this would be a far larger rebranding effort. In a posting on LinkedIn, TfL announced that it is offering an initial opportunity to be the exclusive sponsor of the Waterloo and City line. They say that ‚Äúthis goes far beyond a typical media opportunity. It's full-line branding, from moquette seat fabric and signage to maps and experiential spaces, all right in the heart of London's business district‚Äù This would be far more than a station takeover, as it would include the trains as well as the stations. The Waterloo and City line has likely been chosen to pilot the scheme, partially because it's a smaller line, but also because it offers a complete brand takeover for the entire journey from station to station. A TfL spokesperson said: ‚ÄúThis new opportunity on the Waterloo & City line is part of our ongoing work to find new ways brands can use our network to engage with their audiences as they travel across the city. No line or stations will be renamed, but brands will have the chance to further incorporate their brand identity on platforms and in the train carriages, including on the seat moquette. ‚ÄúAll revenue generated through any brand partnerships with us will be invested into the wider transport network, helping to keep London moving.‚Äù Whatever the end result, it will likely be controversial. Previous branding efforts have been controversial, none more so than the renaming of Bond Street tube station as Burberry Street station, which was accused of confusing passengers. That was a major wayfinding signage change, whereas most station branding campaigns tend to be more subtle. For example, the recent Playstation ad campaign on the Victoria line didn't seem to annoy people as it was subtle and also played into the London Underground branding. Then again, imagine riding the Yellow Pages train, where an entire tube train was turned bright yellow inside and out. Done well, advertising can even be popular. Yes, really. The swiftly announced renaming of (Gareth) Southgate tube station in 2018 saw people travelling to the station specifically to take a photo, and Picardilly Circus station for Star Trek was likewise popular. (c) TfL So, the message is that if you're a consumer-friendly brand with a loyal fan base and you play into the London Underground brand as well, then you can get away with it. So long as it doesn't confuse people."

Inspired by the simplicity of nature and Chanel's 31 rue Cambon ateliers, the line was the last created by the label's in-house team before new creative director Matthieu Blazy's first runway debuts in October. Tweed skirt suits, separates, and dresses were crafted in smooth knits and soft mohair, cast in tonal shades of deep gold, cream, plum, black, and dark green. Added levity came from multicolored flowers, seen in embroidery on dresses and coats. Wheat ears‚Äîwhich Gabrielle Chanel saw as a symbol of abundance‚Äîwere prominent throughout the collection, embroidered across dresses, embossed on sparkling buttons, and clutched in a golden bouquet held by the show's finale bride. A star-studded crowd was in attendance for the occasion as well, including Lorde, Gracie Abrams, Keira Knightley, Naomi Campbell, Laufey, Kirsten Dunst, Sofia Coppola, Romy Mars, Cosima Mars, Marion Cotillard, and more. All images: Courtesy of Chanel Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, and Neiman Marcus Face Dropping Summer Sales It's shaping up to be a challenging sales year for luxury brands‚Äîincluding Saks Fifth Avenue. The retailer, which merged earlier this year with Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman in a $2.7 billion deal, has faced a sales drop of 28% compared to 2024, according to The Business of Fashion. Alongside Saks, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf's sales also dropped 26% each compared to last year. The shift follows Saks Global's release of its financial performance in May, where the combined revenue of Saks, Neiman's, and Bergdorf's dropped 10% to $7.3 billion. The group's low sales also follow the luxury slowdown of 2024 that's continued into 2025, with decreasing sales affecting brands including Chanel, Herm√®s, Gucci, Burberry, and more.

The policy, which has existed at U.S. airports from the Transportation Security Administration since 2006, is being phased out this year, according to People. Some airports have already let passengers keep their shoes on while checking in, including Baltimore/Washington International Airport, Portland International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, Fort Lauderdale International Airport, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, and Piedmont Triad International Airport. As of Monday, the New York City's LaGuardia Airport and Los Angeles International Airport have also apparently begun implanting the new policy as well. However, if passengers' shoes trigger security scanners, they will still have to remove their shoes to be screened. (firstVIEW) Additional reporting by Julia Karns and Katie Bradshaw.

mov_8E21A7B6C2C10FEDA02749C3F02111D4,2025-07-09 13:11:15,en,WEB,"‚Äâ We know ‚Äî our dining coverage has been patchy lately. But we're back in the game. Here's a quick look at the openings that stood out in 2025 so far, plus a heads up: our monthly Where We're Eating & Drinking column is coming back, too. Spanish food: Atica, Ocean's Table - both have spanish menus with different angles of spanish food and completely different styles. Bars: Nora's Wine Shop & Bar, Penicillin - new spots for wine and cocktails that show two different sides of Shanghai nightlife. Pop ups: Nono's - a fun concept that opened in April and is back with a test kitchen at different F&B spots around the city. Special mentions: A few new fine dining places, a Japanese omakase, new places in the PAC, and some luxury label caf√©s. √°tica This will be Bottega group's fourth restaurant in Shanghai and third restaurant off of Xiangyang. √Åtica is a Spanish tapas restaurant from the Bottega and Forno team (Beijing), on the rooftop terrace of the Basement FG mansion just off Xiangyang Park (Xiangyang Bei Lu and Xinle Lu). The menu, made by Ferran Edo Andreu (also of Ocean's Table), has traditional Spanish tapas with dishes like olive and anchovy skewers with pickled Navarra piparra (58rmb), confit piquillo peppers with toasted peanuts (38rmb), and three kinds of patatas (48‚Äì58rmb). There's even flan (48rmb). The patio was built for long afternoons and summer nights: a full gin & tonic menu (16), eight types of sangria, and classic cocktails. DJs every weekend, and live flamenco on most. Atica seems like its designed to feel familiar to anyone who's spent time in Spain. Expect a wait or book ahead. penicillin Hong Kong's Penicillin (ranked #24 on Asia's 50 Best Bars), now has a Shanghai outpost. It's not here to serve your usual gin and tonic or whiskey sour. Opened in April, this is the spot for drinkers who want to be surprised. Expect cocktails with ingredients like fermented rice water, grilled red cabbage soda, or rotovap waste shell vodka. Drinks are split into fermented cocktails (88rmb), mocktails (75rmb), with 15 cocktails (90rmb), some exclusive to the Shanghai menu. The space is photo-friendly: glass-top tables with succulents, a tree in the center of the entryway, and a frozen (or heated) bar panel depending on the season. There's also a VIP room with no minimum spend. As the founders Agung Prabowo and Laura (originally from Indonesia) say, ""Everyone is VIP."" Sustainability is core to Penicillin: no coasters, plenty of ingredient upcycling, and a tree planted in Indonesia for every drink sold. Come curious, leave buzzed. Ocean's Table Ocean's Table opened in early June in the old Commune Social space. While its predecessor was modern fusion, Ocean's Table leans more contemporary Spanish. The interior still feels familiar: a sleek, two-story layout with the wraparound open kitchen bar and ‚Äî thankfully ‚Äî that leafy garden patio intact. Spanish chef Ferran Edo Andreu leads with a seafood-forward lineup, plus wagyu and vegetarian plates. Brunch runs Friday to Sunday, 11am‚Äì2pm, with set menus (268‚Äì398rmb) that include coffee and optional sangria. Dinner is √† la carte, tapas-style, with mains topping out at 288rmb. Cocktails are between 58‚Äì98rmb, with a full wine list for when things go long. The upstairs bar seats about eight and leads to a small rooftop where you can take your drink and unwind. With its flexible layout, Ocean's Table works for a date, a group dinner, or solo time at the bar with a plate of croquettes and a glass of sangria. Bizy Boy Don't let the sandwich fame fool you: Bizy Boy is running a full, chef-driven menu. They opened in March and quickly made waves online for the above-mentioned, lunch-time only, pastrami sandwich. Chef Jeremy's menu includes house-made pastas like scallop mousse ravioli with black tiger prawn (128rmb), and rigatoni with scallop, spicy tomato, and vodka sauce (138rmb). You'll also find beetroot-apple soda (35rmb) and marinated mushrooms with burrata (98rmb). The food might read upscale, but the space keeps things casual and fun. Colorful interiors, collabs with brands like Bloom Coffee, and events like their recent block party with Franklin (Next Bottle, Nono's), where they turned the pastrami sandwich into a taco, makes this place more like a neighborhood restaurant. Come for the sandwich, stay for the menu. Nono's Nono's is a semi-elusive pop-up concept fromthe Yaya's boys, Chef Chris Zhu (Blaz), and Franklin from Next Bottle. It started as a cheeky offshoot of Yaya's but has evolved into something more refined and experimental. No spicy egg yolk pappardelle or Sichuan eggplant here. Instead, it's a blend of Italian and Chinese.Think squid spaghetti with xuecai (118rmb) and Bone Marrow (108rmb)...."

Arnold Jerocki/Save this storySaveSave this storySave In April, Emma Watson turned 35 years old. She also celebrated more than five years away from the movies: the last time we saw her on the big screen was in Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Little Women, released back in 2019. Though Watson has been largely away from the spotlight since then, she has kept busy. Watson started an MA in creative writing at Oxford University in 2023; according to the Daily Mail, university life captivates her so much that she also started a PhD program this year. Perhaps Watson is making up for lost time. When she finished secondary school, she was unable to immediately enter university because she was committed to filming the last two installments of the Harry Potter saga. She took a gap year, then enrolled at Brown University to study English literature. Watson graduated in five years instead of four because she had to take two whole semesters off to film projects like My Week with Marilyn, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Bling Ring, This Is the End, and Noah. This time around, she has taken a complete hiatus from her film career so that it does not interfere with her education. But this is not the only reason she has stepped away from the movies. ‚ÄúI think I felt a bit caged,‚Äù Watson told the Financial Times in the spring of 2023, shortly before starting her master's degree. ‚ÄúThe thing I found really hard was that I had to go out and sell something that I really didn't have very much control over. To stand in front of a film and have every journalist be able to say, 'How does this align with your viewpoint?' It was very difficult to have to be the face and the spokesperson for things where I didn't get to be involved in the process.‚Äù A few months later, in December 2023, she admitted to the British edition of Vogue that she was grateful for the respite she had taken. ‚ÄúI'm just so glad that I did [step away from acting] because I have this feeling of having my own voice and creative space and sovereignty in some way that I don't think I did before ‚Äì more autonomy,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúI'm so glad that I allowed things to be messy for a minute and to really allow myself to not know [what's next], because the knowing that I've come to, I wouldn't trade that for anything.‚Äù Watson used that creative space, to make her directorial debut in 2022 with a short film for Prada Beauty's Paradoxe fragrance campaign; she also wrote the script and acted in it. In 2024, Watson became the face of Prada's Re-Nylon collection, made solely from nylon taken from the recycling and purification of plastic collected from the sea. Emma Watson has been committed to sustainable fashion since she was a teenager. In 2009 she was already linked as a creative advisor to People Tree, one of the pioneers of ethical fashion. In 2020 she joined the board of directors of People Tree. That same year, she also joined the board of directors of Kering, the luxury conglomerate that encompasses firms such as Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, to lead its sustainability committee. Watson was its youngest member at the time. She left the position in 2023, when she returned to university. That year Watson also began a new and novel business venture alongside her younger brother, Alex, with whom she is very close. (He also has a background in fashion; in 2010, he starred in a campaign for Burberry with his sister.) Watson launched her own French-style gin, Renais, recalling her roots: Watson was born and lived near Paris until her parents divorced when she was five years old. The gin is made with sustainability in mind, and is very much anchored in the Watsons' family history. Their father, Chris, has owned vineyards in the Chablis region of Burgundy since the early nineties, and the siblings spent long periods of their childhood there, even participating in the grape harvest. Similar grapes are key to the character of this premium gin. Instagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. ‚ÄúTo me, Renais is a family project; the Chablis region evokes very special memories of growing up. I've loved having the opportunity to create something with my brother Alex,‚Äù Watson said via a statement published in Wine Spectator. ‚ÄúI'm particularly proud of upcycling grapes from vineyards, including my dad's, to reduce waste and create something new.‚Äù The packaging is also sustainable. Watson has personally been in charge of the artistic design of its special editions, as she has shown her more than 73 million Instagram followers. The project is going so well that she and Alex recently received an investment of 5.8 million euros for the international expansion of Renais into more than a dozen countries, including the United States and Spain, where you can already find the gin in specialty stores. The fiercely private Watson does not share her university life on her social networks, but the Daily Mail recently photographed her taking part in one of Oxford's great traditions: acting as coxswain on a women's rowing team. The week before, the same tabloid reported on an alleged lakeside picnic date Watson had with a fellow student. Her last known relationship was with Brandon Green, son of businessman Sir Philip Green‚Äîalthough, again according to the Daily Mail, they broke up in 2023 after just over a year and a half together. Watson has always been very proud of her independence, and in fact coined the term ‚Äúself-partnered.‚Äù The big question is when we will see Watson in the movies again. She reiterated to Vogue last year that her hiatus is not a retirement, and that in the future she sees herself acting in projects that she directs, writes and/or produces. She also remains close to the industry, as evidenced by her surprise appearance at the Cannes Film Festival in May, an event she hasn't attended since presenting Sofia Coppola's The Bling Ring in 2013. The Oxford Mail recently speculated that she is being considered to be the next Bond girl, a role that does not seem to fit precisely with her roadmap. But with a prestigious director like Denis Villeneuve attached to the project, who knows?..."

Watch: The Valley's Janet Caperna Details Working for Cameron Diaz as Assistant Janet Caperna is tuning out the haters. 's Jesse Lally shot down speculation that his costar recently fled the country after receiving backlash on social media amid the ongoing drama currently playing out of the Bravo series' second season. ""I love the 'fled' thing,"" Jesse reacted to the rumors during the July 8 episode of SiriusXM's . ""I will confirm this now. They called me‚Äîone of my best friends lives in Zurich‚Äîand they were talking about summer vacations, going to Switzerland, maybe Lake Como. I gave them recommendations. That was a planned vacation. That was much needed."" And Jesse thinks Janet, her husband Jason Caperna and their 18-month-old son Cameron deserve the much-needed summer getaway, whether they are trying to escape the online chatter or not. ""I mean, Switzerland would be a good place to flee to,"" the real estate mogul jokingly added. ""I would do that right now if I could."" Jesse also weighed in on the polarizing reaction fans have had towards Janet throughout the show's two seasons. ""The thing about Janet, I think, the reaction from the crowd is, 'What do we know about Janet and Jason? What made Jason choose the law? What is this story with Janet's past marriage? Where did she come from?'"" Jesse noted. ""All of those questions we don't know the answers to because it's just constant sort of involving yourself in other storylines instead of creating your own storyline. I think if there were these storylines, maybe there'd be some vulnerability with them."" Plus, after Janet inserted herself in the feud between Kristen Doute and Jesse's estranged wife Michelle Saniei during the June 24 episode, Jesse added of the backlash, ""Right now, people are just reacting to her constantly trying to be involved in these dramatic situations."" ""People are really drilling her with that one,"" he continued, ""and it's true: She didn't need to be involved in that conversation."" Jesse's comments come one week after Janet made her Instagram private following the social media hate. ""It's gotten so dark and bad almost on a daily basis of threats and slurs and things that now I decided to make all of my social media completely private,"" she said on the July 2 episode of her podcast. ""[I'm] being very cautious about what I share, especially about my family...If you're feeling so bothered by [] that you're using racial slurs and threatening people, reality TV is not for you.""

The gin is made with sustainability in mind, and is very much anchored in the Watsons' family history. Their father, Chris, has owned vineyards in the Chablis region of Burgundy since the early '90s, and the siblings spent long periods of their childhood there, even participating in the grape harvest. Similar grapes are key to the character of this premium gin. Instagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. ‚ÄúTo me, Renais is a family project; the Chablis region evokes very special memories of growing up. I've loved having the opportunity to create something with my brother Alex,‚Äù Watson said via a statement published in Wine Spectator. ‚ÄúI'm particularly proud of upcycling grapes from vineyards, including my dad's, to reduce waste and create something new.‚Äù The packaging is also sustainable. Watson has personally been in charge of the artistic design of its special editions, as she has shown her 73 million Instagram followers. The project is going so well that she and Alex recently received an investment of 5.8 million euros for the international expansion of Renais into more than a dozen countries, including the United States and Spain, where you can already find the gin in specialty stores. The fiercely private Watson does not share her university life on her social networks, but the Daily Mail recently photographed her taking part in one of Oxford's great traditions: acting as coxswain on a women's rowing team. The week before, the same tabloid reported on an alleged lakeside picnic date Watson had with a fellow student. Her last known relationship was with Brandon Green, son of businessman Sir Philip Green‚Äîalthough, again according to the Daily Mail, they broke up in 2023 after just over a year and a half together. Watson has always been proud of her independence, and in fact coined the term ‚Äúself-partnered.‚Äù The big question is when we will see Watson in the movies again. She reiterated to Vogue last year that her hiatus is not a retirement, and that in the future she sees herself acting in projects that she directs, writes, and/or produces. She also remains close to the industry, as evidenced by her surprise appearance at the Cannes Film Festival in May, an event she hasn't attended since presenting Sofia Coppola's The Bling Ring in 2013. The Oxford Mail recently speculated that she is being considered to be the next Bond girl, a role that does not seem to fit precisely with her roadmap. But with a prestigious director like Denis Villeneuve attached to the project, who knows? Original story in VF Spain. The post appeared first on Vanity Fair."

""Superman"" at TCL Chinese Theatre at TCL Chinese Theatre on July 07, 2025 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Matt Winkelmeyer/WireImage)Matt WinkelmeyerSave this storySaveSave this storySave There's competition on the red carpet. Last month, Brad Pitt completed a highly successful fashion marathon while promoting his new project, F1. This month, it's Nicholas Hoult revealing himself as a real model before the eyes of photographers. The British actor first came to public attention at the age of 17 in the series Skins, alongside other future celebrities such as Dev Patel, Daniel Kaluuya, and Kaya Scodelario. Now in his thirties, he stars in Superman‚Äîin cinemas July 11‚Äîas the great villain Lex Luthor. After a successful 2024, where he starred in three major films‚ÄîJuror No. 2, Nosferatu, and The Order‚Äîthe actor is moving on to something even bigger. And he's well aware of the stakes, judging by his clothing choices during the Superman promotional tour, where he's been stealing the show even David Corenswet, who plays Superman himself. Like Pitt, Nicholas Hoult has relied on signature pieces to find his style. The actor is working with Jason Bolden, a stylist to the stars whose male clients include actors Michael B. Jordan and Aaron Pierre, as well as basketball player Stephen Curry. Together, the duo have created a capsule wardrobe, featuring timeless garments with a touch of modernity added through accessorizing or less classic pieces. The actor's fashion marathon began off the red carpet, with a brief (but noteworthy) stopover in New York.

A brown suit by Tom Ford, with an open jacket and beige cotton T-shirt for a semi-formal look. Hoult then appeared in a white tank top covered by a loose-fitting short-sleeved shirt, again in brown. The paparazzi also photographed him in a white wife-beater lightly covered by a gray sweater tied around his torso, accompanied by C√©line jeans.

Hoult brought the same signature pieces‚Äîthis time, coupled with Bottega Veneta's Weekender Getaway bag‚Äîduring his visit to London. But instead of a white tank top, he wore a Prada outfit, consisting of a brown t-shirt (his new favorite color) with rolled-up sleeves and linen pants, and sunglasses hanging from his belt. He put his exposed biceps away for Superman's London premiere on July 3. Instead, he brought a suit out of his closet: one that was striped and signed Bottega Veneta. The following day, he appeared in a casual look with a Burberry leather jacket from the Winter 2025 collection.

F91233A6BD66151447D65234597CA668,2025-07-10 08:23:14,en,PRINT,"‚Äâ In the sports world, some wives and girlfriends are more famous than the athletes they are watching. Fashion brands have noticed. As Wimbledon was underway this week, with players adhering to the tournament's strict all-white dress code, fashion watchers turned their attention to the stands, where personalities like Morgan Riddle, the fashion influencer and girlfriend of the American tennis player Taylor Fritz, brought a slightly bolder look to the Grand Slam. On Monday, the tournament's first day, Ms. Riddle wore a blush pink mini dress by Patou, paired with matching strawberry-adorned mules (a nod to the tournament's well-known strawberry and cream dish) and a red Chanel purse. Her blond hair was tied into a half up, half down style with face-framing tendrils. ''If I dressed incredibly inappropriately for Wimbledon, it would be blasted on social media almost instantly and people would probably troll him for it,'' Ms. Riddle said in an interview, referring to Mr. Fritz. Her wardrobe teems with skirts, dresses, blazers and button-down shirts from brands like Thom Browne, Miu Miu and Burberry -- a far cry from her early days on tour with Mr. Fritz, whom she began a relationship with in 2020. Back then, Ms. Riddle, who did not grow up watching tennis, favored jeans, crop tops and sweatshirts. But as she became more enmeshed in the world of the elite sport, her style evolved to meet its expectations. While Wimbledon does not enforce a dress code for spectators, attendees are encouraged to dress ''smart.'' For men, that typically means tailored separates in muted tones; for women, sundresses and low heels. Ms. Riddle takes it a step further. She is polished from every angle, with every sartorial detail deliberate. That's partly because she is a WAG. The term WAG, an acronym used to refer to the wives and girlfriends of sports stars, gained popularity in the British tabloids in the early 2000s, when it was often attached to the glamorous partners of male soccer players. It reached a fever pitch during the 2006 World Cup, when figures like Victoria Beckham were covered almost as closely as the players themselves were. WAGs have taken on a second life in the American sports world, linked to basketball, football and, more recently, Formula 1 and tennis. Vogue called the summer, packed with the N.B.A. playoffs, the U.S. Open, the Stanley Cup and more, ''WAG season,'' spotlighting figures like Jordyn Woods, an influencer and the girlfriend of the Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns as well as Kendall Murray, whose partner is Braiden McGregor of the New York Jets. Publications like Glamour published ''get the look'' edits inspired by Taylor Swift's game day outfits as she watched her boyfriend, Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs, play. Fashion brands have taken note. They're not just dressing the athletes anymore, but their partners, too -- for games, appearances and front rows. Reformation leaned in directly, debuting a collection last month designed for tennis spectators with the tagline: ''Those who can't play, watch.'' As interest in the styling choices of WAGs grows, the question becomes: What even is WAG style? Andrew Pokorny, a television producer who worked on ''WAGs Miami,'' a reality series from E! that aired in the mid-2010s, said that while there was not a singular look, most WAGs followed styling codes. For him, it comes down to one thing: projecting wealth. ''The bank account that they have access to, either through marriage or because they've been given beautiful gifts by their partners, does signal access to an elite club,'' Mr. Pokorny said. Bags from Louis Vuitton, Herm√®s and Fendi are mainstays, as are shoes from Christian Louboutin. But the illusion of wealth matters, too. According to Mr. Pokorny, many women on the show did not want to be seen in the same outfit twice, and they often worked with fast fashion companies like Fashion Nova to maintain the appearance of an endless wardrobe. In 2016, when the show was filming, that led to some flashy choices. But today's most visible WAGs opt for a more understated look. ''Whether it's ostentatious or subverted, it's always intentional,'' Mr. Pokorny said. '' These WAGs know that people are looking at them. It just depends on what's called for at the time.'' The performance of femininity is also crucial to WAG style, said Judy Liao, a professor at the University of Alberta who researches the sociology of sport and gender. In elite men's sports, women have traditionally been sidelined, seen by many as accessories helping to bolster their partner's masculinity rather than as ardent fans or active participants. What a WAG wears, and how she carries herself, can play a key role in that performance, Dr. Liao said. She sees the resurgence of the WAG as partly a pushback to the growing visibility of women's sports and of bodies that fall outside what she calls the Western ideal of femininity and heteronormativity. ''They're too strong, too Black or too queer,'' she said. '' That's still slightly challenging for the North American mainstream audience to really digest.'' ''WAGs really kind of offer the mainstream media this really good material to say, 'We support gender equality because we're showing women in sport,''' Dr. Liao added. '' But it's not the women who are actually playing the sports.'' Athletes themselves have noticed. In April, Daria Saville, the Australian professional tennis player, took to TikTok to express frustration over women tennis players being passed over for brand partnerships in favor of WAGs. Women who, she said, fit the tennis aesthetic that brands were profiting from. There has been, however, a growing trend of brands tapping women athletes for campaigns and endorsement deals. They include the W.N.B.A. player Angel Reese (Good American), the tennis star Coco Gauff (New Balance) and the rugby player Ilona Maher (Maybelline). But WAGs continue to thrive, with some developing larger social media followings than their partners. Sartorially, though, most roads lead back to the athlete. Dressing often becomes a form of fashion diplomacy, echoing the way political spouses represent their partners abroad...."

Referring to the way in which the Princess of Wales wearing an outfit or piece of jewelry can lead to items selling out online in minutes and even websites crashing, it has been a firm feature of the royal narrative ever since Kate came on the scene. So the announcement this summer that the Princess, along with Prince William, will now have the power to grant Royal Warrants comes with a significant dose of anticipation for the businesses who may be in the running to receive one. She will be the first Princess of Wales to be a grantor in more than 100 years. But, perhaps more pertinently, the first ever to make such endorsements in the online shopping era. ‚ÄúThere is a large swath of royal watchers who came to follow the royal family through her and, importantly, shop the brands she wears,‚Äù Elizabeth Holmes, author of the New York Times bestseller, HRH: So Many Thoughts on Royal Style, tells T&C. ‚ÄúI think the Princess now being able to grant royal warrants will introduce this honor in a new way to a new generation of royal watchers.‚Äù So what exactly is this coveted honor and who is eligible? A Royal Warrant is an official mark of recognition for individuals or companies who have regularly supplied goods or services to the royal household. A business must have supplied a royal for at least five out of the last seven years to qualify and must now also demonstrate a commitment to sustainability. The range of holders covers everything from clothing to food and drink to cleaning products and services, stationery, transport and home and gardening services. Holders can describe themselves as ‚Äúby appointment‚Äù to the royals and display the arms belonging to the royal who selected them on their products and packaging. ‚ÄúA Royal Warrant is seen by many firms as the gold standard of endorsements,‚Äù says royal journalist Richard Palmer. ‚ÄúIt's an honor but more importantly it's of commercial value‚Ä¶Kate's warrant will be especially sought after.‚Äù Shop Kate's Wardrobe Staples McQueen Classic Single-Breasted Suiting Blazer Kiki McDonough Classics Green Amethyst Pear Drop Earrings Mulberry Amberley Clutch Emmy London Rebecca High Heel After Queen Elizabeth's death there was a review of Royal Warrants and for a while King Charles was the only grantor. Queen Camilla has since been appointed a grantor, and she now has 14 warrants while the King has 586. The Palace announced that William and Kate will award their first warrants in a two-step process. Firstly, companies with warrants from the King or Queen can apply to also be endorsed by William or Kate. Those applications are open now and the selections will be announced next spring. Next year, applications will be open to other companies. So who might Kate choose? Intriguingly, while there is no requirement for warrant-holders to be British-owned or UK-based, William's private secretary made it clear that this is the route the couple plan to take. ‚ÄúTheir Royal Highnesses are delighted to be able to recognise and celebrate British industry, creativity and skills through the granting of Warrants,‚Äù Ian Patrick said. Two favorite clothing brands of Kate's, Burberry and Barbour, already hold warrants from the King. She could also potentially add her endorsement to milliner Philip Treacy, who has a warrant from the Queen. In new appointments, several experts have suggested that her go-to designers Catherine Walker and Jenny Packham are at the top of the list of contenders. ‚ÄúKey factors are likely to include a brand's history and heritage, its role in British culture and contributions to the community, as well as its corporate governance and business practices,‚Äù Susan Kelley, founder of website What Kate Wore, tells T&C. Kelley cites labels including ‚ÄúCatherine Walker, Erdem, Beulah London, Jenny Packham, and perhaps a childrenswear brand like Trotters London,‚Äù as contenders. ‚ÄúBrora, a clothing brand specializing in cashmere manufactured using heritage textile mills in Scotland, seems a very good candidate for recognition, as do Campbell's of Beauly and Dubarry of Ireland,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúI do wonder if Kate, who has mastered the art of high-low dressing, will include more affordable brands in her royal warrant selection,‚Äù says Elizabeth Holmes. ‚ÄúHer high street choices have made her seem accessible in a novel way, and I'm certain the impact on those brands would be sizable should she choose to recognize them.‚Äù Shop Kate's Wardrobe Staples Jenny Packham Georgia Embellished Sequined Tulle Gown Monica Vinader Siren Gemstone Wire Earrings LK Bennett Dora Green Suede Envelope Clutch Penelope Chilvers Tassel Knee High Boot Royal fashion expert Christine Ross also points out that the impact of a warrant could be more measurable if Kate chooses smaller or more affordable brands. ‚ÄúA brand's accessibility in both price and international delivery would be key to their Royal Warrant leading to success,‚Äù she adds. Kate's influence on the British fashion industry is so often highlighted, with figures such as her boosting it by an estimated ¬£1 billion annually repeatedly cited. But there is a point to be made about to what extent she will want to highlight fashion with her first tranche of appointments. ‚ÄúThe royal warrants come at an interesting time in the broader royal fashion conversation,‚Äù Elizabeth Holmes says. ‚ÄúSo much has been made about whether or not to discuss the Princess's wardrobe, and where she wants the focus to be. That sentiment seems to have been walked back, and we've seen a number of fashion-focused moments this year, but it will be interesting to see the types of warrants she grants, and what share of those are clothing and accessories versus other categories.‚Äù ‚ÄúI suspect their first few Royal Warrants will be conservatively chosen,‚Äù says Christine Ross...."

Jesse Clark Garc√≠a se declar√≥ culpable el martes en un tribunal federal de San Diego de nueve cargos relacionados con la importaci√≥n de drogas. En su acuerdo de culpabilidad, admiti√≥ que √©l y otro exoficial de la CBP, Diego Bonillo, conspiraron con una organizaci√≥n narcotraficante mexicana no identificada para hacerse de la vista gorda mientras veh√≠culos cargados de narc√≥ticos pasaban por sus carriles de inspecci√≥n. Bonillo se declar√≥ inocente de cargos similares y su juicio est√° previsto para finales de mes. Garc√≠a enfrenta una pena de entre 10 a√±os y cadena perpetua cuando sea sentenciado, y una posible multa de hasta 10 millones de d√≥lares. Su abogado se neg√≥ a comentar sobre su declaraci√≥n de culpabilidad el mi√©rcoles. Los fiscales alegaron que Garc√≠a y Bonillo se lucraron generosamente con la conspiraci√≥n criminal, obteniendo decenas de miles de d√≥lares por cada veh√≠culo cargado de drogas que introdujeron en Estados Unidos sin escrutinio. La acusaci√≥n formal aleg√≥ que ambos hombres permitieron el ingreso de m√°s de 500 kilos de drogas a Estados Unidos en cinco ocasiones entre abril de 2021 y febrero de 2024, aunque esa cifra solo inclu√≠a las drogas que las autoridades incautaron posteriormente. Documentos judiciales presentados por los fiscales el a√±o pasado indicaban que Garc√≠a ‚Äúviv√≠a con un salario muy superior al que le correspond√≠a en la CBP‚Äù y hac√≠an referencia a su copropiedad de un establo de carreras de caballos, la propiedad de varios veh√≠culos, una casa en San Diego, un rancho en construcci√≥n en M√©xico y la compra de art√≠culos de lujo de las marcas Burberry y Louis Vuitton. Tanto Garc√≠a como Bonillo fueron arrestados en mayo de 2024 como resultado de una investigaci√≥n dirigida por el Grupo de Trabajo contra la Corrupci√≥n Fronteriza de la oficina local del FBI en San Diego. Seg√∫n la acusaci√≥n y otros registros judiciales, los investigadores cre√≠an que la actividad delictiva de Garc√≠a comenz√≥ en abril de 2021. Una investigaci√≥n posterior revel√≥ patrones de presuntos narcotraficantes que sol√≠an cruzar el puerto de entrada de Tecate solo cuando Garc√≠a trabajaba y solo por su carril. La fiscal√≠a aleg√≥ que algunos de esos mismos veh√≠culos o conductores tambi√©n pasaban regularmente por el carril de Bonilla en el puerto de entrada de Otay Mesa. La fiscal√≠a aleg√≥ que, cerca del final de la investigaci√≥n por corrupci√≥n el a√±o pasado, Garc√≠a cruz√≥ la frontera hacia M√©xico con un veh√≠culo lleno y dej√≥ de presentarse a trabajar. Solo regres√≥ a Estados Unidos despu√©s de que las autoridades mexicanas lo arrestaran y lo entregaran a las autoridades estadounidenses en la frontera de Arizona. Agentes del FBI arrestaron a Bonillo unos d√≠as despu√©s en Las Vegas, donde la fiscal√≠a alega que se alojaba en un hotel de lujo y ten√≠a entradas de 2000 d√≥lares para un combate de boxeo de alto perfil. ‚ÄúNo toleramos la mala conducta dentro de nuestras filas‚Äù, declar√≥ un portavoz de la CBP el a√±o pasado en respuesta a preguntas sobre los agentes. Cuando descubrimos cualquier presunta o posible falta de conducta, la remitimos de inmediato a investigaci√≥n y cooperamos plenamente con cualquier investigaci√≥n penal o administrativa. Garc√≠a y Bonillo fueron arrestados un mes antes de que su excolega, Leonard Darnell George, fuera a juicio por un caso similar, pero no relacionado. George fue sentenciado a 23 a√±os de prisi√≥n despu√©s de que un jurado lo declarara culpable de permitir el paso de drogas y migrantes indocumentados por el puerto de entrada de San Ysidro a cambio de cientos de miles de d√≥lares en sobornos. Los exoficiales de la CBP Farlis Almonte, Ricardo Rodr√≠guez y Kairy Quinonez enfrentan cargos por permitir el paso de inmigrantes indocumentados por sus carriles de inspecci√≥n en San Ysidro a cambio de sobornos. Ambos se han declarado inocentes de dichos cargos. Original Story"

Crews from Union Fire Company No. 1 and other York County stations were called to the 100 block around 2:52 p.m. on Tuesday, July 9, 2025, according to Station 23. Smoke was showing from a two-story residential structure when responders arrived. Firefighters made entry and discovered heavy fire engulfing the kitchen with flames extending to the second floor, the department said. Due to the intense heat of the day, a second alarm was struck to bring in additional manpower. One cat was rescued from the home, but tragically, two others perished in the blaze. One firefighter was hospitalized for a heat-related injury, according to officials. The cause of the fire remains under investigation."

The internationally oriented FTSE 100 fell 0.5% by 0925 GMT but was on track for a third week of gains. The midcap index dropped 0.3% and was also set for weekly gains. Britain's economy shrank for a second consecutive month in May, as declines in industrial output and construction outweighed growth in services, adding to domestic challenges for Finance Minister Rachel Reeves. ""It will now take something quite special for the UK to avoid an outright contraction in GDP in Q2, which doesn't appear at all likely quite frankly given the perfect storm of downside risks,"" said Matthew Ryan, head of market strategy at global financial services firm Ebury. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump ramped up his trade war by announcing 35% tariffs on Canada on Thursday, while adding that blanket tariffs of 15% or 20% would be implemented on most other trading partners. Sectoral gains on Friday were led by precious metal miners with safe-haven gold rising on the expanding trade war. Fresnillo added 2% while Hochschild and Endeavour rose 1.6% and 1%, respectively. Energy giant BP shares rose 2.3% to top of the blue-chip after the company forecasted a higher upstream output production for second-quarter driving gains for oil and gas stocks. Losses on the day were led by personal good stocks with luxury brand Burberry dropping 2.2%. Dr. Martens fell 1.5%. Traders are currently pricing in a 78.6% chance of a rate cut during August's Bank of England meeting, according to data compiled by LSEG.

mov_DF5998B17D0D44AE1FCDB3D6D22F61CF,2025-07-11 11:35:14,en,WEB,"‚Äâ The latest earnings season kicks off in the week ahead, with a number of companies across a range of sectors due to report. Results from the major US investment banks act as the traditional starting gun for earnings season, with Goldman Sachs (GS) among those due to report. Another big name set to report in the coming week is Netflix (NFLX), with the stock trading near record highs, as the streaming giant has appeared to remain relatively insulated from tariff shocks that have weighed on other tech companies. In the semiconductor sector, TSMC (2330. TW, TSM) earnings will be in focus, given the company is the world's largest contract chipmaker so is considered a bellwether for the global industry. Dutch company ASML (ASML.AS, ASML), which is also set to report, is another company considered to act as a barometer for the health of the chip sector as its lithography machines are used to make semiconductors. What could trigger a late summer crisis for markets in the third quarter? Back on the London market, investors will be keeping an eye on Burberry's (BRBY.L) latest trading update, to see how the luxury fashion brand's turnaround efforts are progressing. Here's more on what to look out for: Major investment banks have become more bullish in their outlook for US stocks this year, looking past near-term uncertainties. Earlier this week, Goldman Sachs (GS) became the latest bank to raise its year-target for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index, from 6,100 to 6,600 points. The index closed at 6,280.46 points on Thursday, having risen 6.8% year-to-date. According to a Reuters report, Goldman analysts said in a note on Monday: ""A resilient outlook for 2026 earnings growth, the resumption of Fed rate cuts, and neutral investor positioning argue for further market upside as the recent narrow rally broadens."" Bank of America (BAC) also lifted its S&P 500 (^GSPC) target this week, while Barclays (BARC.L), Citigroup (C) and Deutsche Bank (DBK.DE) raised theirs last month. Goldman appeared to benefit from market volatility in the first quarter, with its revenue from equities trading up 27% year-on-year to $4.19bn (¬£3.09bn), as investors sought to adjust their portfolios amid tariff turmoil. The firm's total revenue in the first quarter rose 6% to $15.06bn, which beat analyst consensus of $14.8bn, according to Bloomberg. Meanwhile, earnings per share of $14.12 also came in ahead of expectations and was up from $11.58n in the first quarter of 2024. Goldman shares have rebounded from a fall following US president Donald Trump's ""Liberation Day"" tariff announcement, and have gained nearly 24% year-to-date, with the stock hitting a fresh high on Monday. While the firm didn't offer specific guidance in those results in April, Goldman CEO David Solomon said at the time that it was ""entering the second quarter with a markedly different operating environment than earlier this year"". Goldman is due to release its second quarter results on Wednesday, along with Bank of America and Morgan Stanley (MS). The day before JPMorgan Chase (JPM), Wells Fargo (WFC), Citigroup, BlackRock (BLK) and BNY Mellon (BK) are set to release their latest earnings. The final series of Squid Game and the latest season of Black Mirror were among the big Netflix releases on the streaming platform in the second quarter. In the first quarter, hit shows including the series Adolescence and the film Back in Action, starring Cameron Diaz, helped keep audiences hooked on the platform. Revenue came in at $10.54bn in the first quarter, which was up 12.5% year-on-year and slightly higher than Bloomberg analyst expectations of $10.5bn. Earnings per share of $6.61 also beat analyst estimates of $5.68. Netflix's revenue guidance of $11.04bn for the second quarter was also higher than the $10.88bn analysts polled by Bloomberg had expected. The streamer has forecasted earnings per share of $7.03 for the second quarter. For full-year 2025, the company reiterated its prior forecast of $43.5bn to $44.5bn revenue growth and operating margins of 29%. Matt Britzman, senior equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""Netflix has been able to demonstrate its qualities as a recession and tariff resilient business, right at a time when those two traits are highly sought after. Add in strong fundamentals, plus good execution, and it's not too surprising to see Netflix flirting with all-time highs as we look ahead to second quarter results next week."" UK economy shrinks for second month in a row Since the company released its first quarter results, its shares have continued to climb, ending June at another record high and the stock is now up nearly 41% year-to-date. ""Netflix doesn't release subscriber growth numbers anymore, so analysts will have to make do with some traditional metrics,"" Britzman said. ""Operating margins will be in focus, with improvements in the last quarter expected to repeat next week as 33% has been touted as the target number."" He added: ""Things are expected to dip in the second half as content spend ramps up but there's scope for full year expectations to move higher if a solid margin number gets printed next week."" Chipmaker TSMC (2330. TW, TSM) released its first half revenue figures on Thursday, giving investors a sense of how it has performed since the start of the year ahead of its latest results. TSMC's revenue for April to June came in at $933.8bn Taiwan dollars (¬£23.6bn), according to Reuters, which was up nearly 39% on the same period last year and beat an LSEG SmartEstimate of $927.831bn Taiwan dollars. For June, TSMC posted revenue of approximately $263.71bn Taiwan dollars, which was down 17.7% on May but was nearly 27% higher than the same month last year. Revenue for January through June totalled $1.77tn Taiwan dollars, which was up 40% on the first six months of last year. Dan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell (AJB.L), said: ""Trading at TSMC remains robust despite a mix of currency headwinds and tariff turmoil, showing just how powerful and resilient the AI theme is proving to be. ""Companies continue to spend heavily in trying to get ahead in artificial intelligence and this benefits businesses such as TSMC which provide the required infrastructure."" Earlier this week, Trump said that tariffs on chips would soon be announced, though TSMC has been investing more in its operations in America. In March, TSMC announced plans to expand its investment in manufacturing in the US by $100bn, on top of the $65bn it was already putting behind its operations in Arizona. Stocks: Create your watchlist and portfolio In addition, TSMC CEO CC Wei said at the company's annual shareholders meeting last month that tariffs ""do have some impact on TSMC, but not directly"". ""That's because tariffs are imposed on importers, not exporters,"" he said, according to a Reuters report. ""TSMC is an exporter.

It appears to be a customer service guide regarding refunds,specifically related to taxes and customs duties when returning goods to Korea. I. General Refund Information (First Section) Voluntary Reporting is Key: If you don't voluntarily report the goods for tax purposes upon entering Korea, you cannot get a refund. Taxation customs Clearance Refund: This section details the documents needed for a refund related to taxes paid during customs clearance.

Necessary documents for Refund: Refund application Customs clearance statement Return and refund confirmation (from duty-free shops) Copy of deposit accounts (for receiving the refund) UNIPASS System: Refunds can be applied for through the UNIPASS system (korea Customs Service's electronic system) if all requirements and documents are met.

Key Takeaways: Voluntary reporting: This is the most important aspect. Documentation: Gather all the listed documents before applying for a refund.

Con il reunion tour finalmente in corso, il capitale culturale della band sembra pi√π attuale che mai: streetwear, moda premium, retail pop-up e attivazioni ironiche sfruttano il ritorno di Liam e Noel per connettersi con una community transgenerazionale, attraverso nostalgia, identit√† e fandom. A guidare l'ondata √® Adidas Originals , che a giugno ha lanciato una collaborazione ad alto profilo con la band. Anticipata sui social e svelata in TV su Channel 4, la campagna √® accompagnata da Live Forever (1994), con un mix di filmati d'archivio e nuove clip dei fratelli Gallagher. In evidenza, i prodotti-guida della collezione: tute, maglie raglan, bucket hat e coach jacket. Non si tratta solo di merchandising, ma di storytelling condiviso. Adidas fa parte del look Oasis fin dai loro albori, e il claim ‚ÄúOriginal Forever‚Äù riscrive quella narrativa per le nuove generazioni. Anche Levi's ha realizzato una capsule di T-shirt in edizione limitata, ma la Oasis Mania va oltre lo streetwear e il denim. Burberry ha lanciato una campagna con Liam Gallagher e i suoi figli Lennon, Gene e Molly, insieme a volti noti come Goldie, Cara Delevingne e Alexa Chung, con uno styling che richiama l'era d'oro Burberry degli anni '90., mentre Stone Island ha scelto Liam come volto della campagna autunnale. Non si tratta solo di endorsement: l'artista √® il concept. Oltre all'impatto culturale, c'√® quello di business: secondo Barclays , i fan UK degli Oasis spenderanno oltre 1 miliardo di sterline tra biglietti, viaggi e merchandising ‚Äì pi√π di quanto registrato dai fan di Taylor Swift in occasione dell'Eras Tour, con sole 2 date in pi√π. Nel cuore di Londra, il temporary store Oasis in Carnaby Street √® gi√† meta di pellegrinaggio per fan e curiosi. T-shirt, hoodie, bucket hat, poster e vinili in edizione limitata ‚Äì inclusa la collezione Adidas Originals x Oasis ‚Äì rendono il punto vendita un'esperienza immersiva che unisce musica e moda. Anche i retailer pi√π mainstream si inseriscono nel trend. Primark ha celebrato la data di apertura del tour a Manchester con una campagna social che chiedeva ai fan di scegliere il loro Gallagher preferito, e un attivazione sul punto vendita con die ingressi separati: Liam e Noel. Lidl , invece, giocando sull'ironi, ha lanciato ¬†Lidl by Lidl, una giacca da concerto in edizione limitata, presentata oltre che sul proprio sito web su un murale nei pressi dell'Etihad Stadium. Prezzo: ¬£30. Caratteristiche: tasche refrigeranti, apribottiglie. Ovviamente esaurita, ma i fan possono approfittare del¬† prossimo drop: il Lidl¬† by Lidl bucket hat. Il tutto con finalit√† benefica a favore dell'NSPCC. Sul fronte digitale, abbiamo gi√† segnalato come  Warner Music abbia attivato uno shop ufficiale con merch esclusivo su Amazon , permettendo ai fan di tutto il mondo di acquistare al di l√† delle date del tour o delle attivazioni locali. Un chiaro segnale: il fandom va oltre il live, e si costruisce anche attraverso una distribuzione scalabile. Sullo sfondo, parka e bucket hat sono l'ossessione della stagione, che qualche professionista dell'abbigliamento definisce ha gi√† definito la ‚ÄúWonderwall Summer‚Äù. L'Oasis Mania non √® solo un ritorno nostalgico. √à un caso di piattaforma culturale attiva : tra collaborazioni fashion, campagne streetwear, progetti retail e attivazioni ironiche, i Gallagher rimangono tra i pochi artisti capaci di connettere generazioni e sottoculture. E in un momento in cui i brand cercano autenticit√†, emozione e narrazione, Oasis √® ancora una colonna sonora che fa vendere."

1lygvjd,2025-07-13 01:41:34,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Hey yall, Been out the game a while & looking at prices these days I figured aside from trying out testers I could perhaps get some advice from some more seasoned folks (pardon the pun). Long story short, the descriptions just do not compute for me. This isn't just with cologne either, but also weed. When someone describes something as nutty or woody, I do not get that at all. I don't smell almond or vanilla, but I do smell the baby powered smell I've seen people use to describe it. So idk. Hoping to just kind of use examples of the vibes I like and see if maybe someone can point me in the right direction. I've used AI to the best of my ability with this, but it refuses to give me actual recommendations outside ones I've already tried (and told it about) and the same handful. Also, the relevant factors coming into play outside of preference are: - I'm 35; - I work in the legal field; and - I'm a cigarette smoker So, when I was young my go-to was Abercrombie fierce, then graduating to aqua De Gio as one did from 2005-2011, perhaps they still do idk lol. Those are too ‚Äúfresh‚Äù and ‚Äúyoung‚Äù to me tho nowadays. I wore guilty by Gucci & Gucci by Gucci in the past and would fluctuate between really liking one and not the other. My favorite female scent is D&G Light Blue, but the male version didn't really do it for me. I bought the Yves Saint Laurent [here](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/yves-saint-laurent-mens-2-pc.-y-myslf-eau-de-parfum-gift-set?ID=19213960&cm_mmc=SMS-_-MAPP_pdpshare-_-n-_-n‚Äù) And while I like them both, I want something a tad ‚Äúheavier‚Äù. I also bought a tester of Tom Ford's Fucking Fabulous and I really enjoy it but the ‚Äúbaby powder‚Äù smell that is present bugs me enough to not wanna fork over the money for a full bottle. But I very much enjoy the ‚Äúcomplexity‚Äù or ‚Äúlayers‚Äù I guess you'd say? And despite being a sweeter smell it endures cigarettes well. Sauvage is good until it isn't. No disrespect but I get axe body spray vibes from it but the grown up version. Bleu is awesome but everyone I know has it. My ex got me a jimmy choo one that I can't recall the exact name of that was so-so but didn't really blow my hair back. Would love you feedback on what u think I should look into more. The ones I've been considering are: - Le Male by SPG - Afternoon Swim (concern is lasting power) - Jazz Club by MM - Valentino Uomo Born in Roma -  Burberry Weekend -  Terre d'Herm√®s - Tom Ford Oud Wood And then based on the descriptions I feel like I prob won't like spice bomb but who knows. Any and all help is greatly appreciated!"

tw_sl_9e5e3e0c48c23eddc1c3991d3131eb2d,2025-07-13 08:16:19,pt,WEB,"‚Äâ SPR_COMBO[pt]Durante anos, ter um Tesla em Portugal era uma afirma√ß√£o. Representava inova√ß√£o tecnol√≥gica, consci√™ncia ambiental e, sobretudo, distin√ß√£o social. N√£o era apenas um autom√≥vel ‚Äî era s√≠mbolo de vanguarda, de luxo moderno sobre quatro rodas. Hoje, basta abrir a aplica√ß√£o da Uber ou da Bolt para perceber o que se perdeu: o Tesla tornou-se banal. Democratizou-se, dir√£o uns; perdeu a alma, digo eu. Nas grandes cidades, os Model 3 e Y circulam em massa ao servi√ßo das plataformas TVDE. S√£o ferramentas de trabalho, conduzidas por motoristas muitas vezes em condi√ß√µes laborais prec√°rias, com hor√°rios longos, cheiros duvidosos e contratos fr√°geis. O prest√≠gio da marca, ironicamente, facilitou essa massifica√ß√£o ‚Äî mas isso √© insustent√°vel. Ou n√£o? Depende do objectivo‚Ä¶ A economia ensina-nos que bens de luxo n√£o seguem as mesmas regras dos bens comuns: o seu valor reside tamb√©m na exclusividade. O economista Thorstein Veblen foi pioneiro ao estudar este fen√≥meno. No final do s√©culo XIX, cunhou o conceito de ‚Äúconsumo consp√≠cuo‚Äù: bens cuja procura aumenta √† medida que o seu pre√ßo sobe, precisamente porque sinalizam riqueza, sucesso e perten√ßa a uma elite. S√£o bens comprados n√£o apenas pela sua utilidade, mas pelo que representam socialmente. O luxo, nesta l√≥gica, n√£o √© acess√≥rio ‚Äî √© o produto. √â por isso que um rel√≥gio Patek Philippe, uma carteira Herm√®s ou um Bentley valem o que valem. S√£o dif√≠ceis de obter, exclusivos por natureza, e intencionalmente assim. O Tesla, no auge, cumpria essa fun√ß√£o: era caro, ecol√≥gico e tecnologicamente avan√ßado ‚Äî logo, para muitos, desej√°vel. Mas com a sua prolifera√ß√£o nas ruas, perdeu esse halo. Tornou-se o novo Peugeot, Renault ou Dacia do s√©culo XXI: funcional, acess√≠vel, repetitivo. Uma m√°quina de costura Singer com rodas, feita para coser percursos sem qualquer emo√ß√£o. Nada contra essas marcas francesas ‚Äî s√£o pr√°ticas, eficientes ‚Äî mas pertencem a outro segmento, por exemplo quando comparadas com marcas premium alem√£s como a Mercedes ou BMW. O Tesla, ao deixar-se banalizar, diluiu-se. Hoje, muitos que compram um Tesla de ‚Ç¨40.000-50.000 fazem-no por leasing ou cr√©dito, muitas vezes sem capacidade real para absorver choques econ√≥micos. Confunde-se acesso tempor√°rio com posse verdadeira. √â uma democratiza√ß√£o ilus√≥ria, onde o luxo se transforma num bem indistinto e desprovido de valor simb√≥lico. Este modelo de consumo ‚Äî ‚Äútudo para todos, a presta√ß√µes‚Äù ‚Äî √© perigoso. Cria endividamento, distorce a perce√ß√£o de riqueza real e inflaciona artificialmente o mercado autom√≥vel. O leasing autom√≥vel generalizado √© o novo subprime da classe m√©dia: uma bolha de consumo sustentada em rendimentos inst√°veis. Isso enfraquece fam√≠lias e corr√≥i a fun√ß√£o distintiva das marcas. Quando tudo √© ‚Äúpremium‚Äù, nada o √©. A hist√≥ria est√° cheia de exemplos. A Burberry enfrentou uma crise reputacional quando se tornou demasiado acess√≠vel. A Mercedes viu a sua imagem seriamente abalada quando integrou motores Renault-Nissan em modelos como o Classe A, B ou GLA. A recupera√ß√£o passou por reposicionar a marca, recentrar na qualidade e revalorizar a exclusividade (com motores Mercedes). A Tesla parece ir no sentido contr√°rio: entrega a sua imagem √†s frotas e incentiva uma falsa acessibilidade via financiamento f√°cil. √Ä boleia da transi√ß√£o energ√©tica e da ansiedade ecol√≥gica, vende-se a ideia de que ‚Äútodos devem ter um Tesla‚Äù ou ‚Äútodos podem ter um Tesla‚Äù. Mas um bem de luxo que todos t√™m‚Ä¶ deixa de o ser. O Tesla tornou-se o uniforme da classe m√©dia urbana globalizada ‚Äî um s√≠mbolo reciclado em produto de massas. √â mimetismo social com ar ecol√≥gico: carneirada travestida de consci√™ncia individual. E aqui Veblen continua atual: o consumo de bens de luxo √©, muitas vezes, guiado por um impulso de distin√ß√£o ‚Äî de se destacar da multid√£o. Quando esse impulso √© frustrado pela massifica√ß√£o, a procura desloca-se para outro s√≠mbolo. √â por isso que marcas verdadeiramente de luxo protegem a sua raridade como um ativo valioso. H√° tamb√©m um lado regulat√≥rio que importa destacar. Os incentivos √† mobilidade el√©trica ‚Äî subs√≠dios, isen√ß√µes fiscais, benef√≠cios no IUC ‚Äî foram bem-intencionados, mas geraram distor√ß√µes. Facilitou-se o acesso a ve√≠culos como os Teslas por motoristas e empresas nas plataformas TVDE, sem grande reflex√£o de fundo sobre o impacto urbano. Em vez de menos carros e mais mobilidade partilhada, temos mais tr√¢nsito ‚Äî agora silencioso, √© certo, mas n√£o menos ca√≥tico. E como se n√£o bastasse, junta-se o novo ‚Äúnormal‚Äù p√≥s-Covid: o ‚Äúteletrabalho‚Äù, essa abstra√ß√£o laboral moderna, espalhou o tr√¢nsito por todas as horas do dia.

mov_C0EB683A05DC0CCE906F4361E8DD3143,2025-07-13 22:05:40,en,WEB,"‚Äâ By Wayne Noir - RION magazine. London's fashion landscape is about to feel a seismic shift. After a hiatus from the live runway, designer Joshua Kane is poised to make a thunderous return with Bespoken Dream‚Äîa new immersive show premiering July 16 at The Mandrake Hotel. Known for blurring the line between fashion and theatre, Kane's work doesn't merely drape the body‚Äîit commands it, turning silhouettes into storylines, buttons into punctuation marks, and seams into symphonic verses. For those unfamiliar with the name (though rare in the world of bespoke), Joshua Kane is far from a conventional tailor. Born in Oxfordshire in 1984, Kane's early years saw him toggling between semi-professional football and sketching designs  in his bedroom. He later enrolled at Kingston University, graduating with a First in Fashion Design, before cutting his teeth at Brooks Brothers in New York, Burberry Prorsum under Christopher Bailey, and ultimately as Senior Designer at Paul Smith. But Kane always had his eyes set on creating his own world‚Äîone in which craftsmanship collided unapologetically with performance. That world came to life in 2014, when Kane founded his namesake label out of his London flat. Within months, his Savile Row-level precision and Edwardian-inflected suiting were walking their own runway at London Collections Men. Soon after, a pop-up in Spitalfields gave way to a flagship on Great Portland Street, then evolved into a private showroom nestled inside a Marylebone townhouse. His studio quickly became more than a space for fittings‚Äîit became a stage. Unlike most designers, Kane doesn't believe in traditional fashion shows. ‚ÄúI never wanted to do a normal catwalk,‚Äù he once told Brummell Magazine. And he meant it. Each of his past showcases‚Äîbe it the cinematic rush of Journey at the London Palladium, or the surreal drama of 2023's Shipwrecked Tailors‚Äîhave drawn comparisons to West End productions. With choreographed movement, live musical scoring, and a cast of dancers, actors, and models, these events blur the boundaries of narrative, couture, and set design. And while the clothes are always the centerpiece, they exist within a living, breathing universe. But Kane's vision extends beyond the physical. In 2023, he dove headlong into the digital realm, designing garments for avatars and metaverse identities, minting NFTs, and testing the limits of digital tailoring‚Äîproving once again that tradition, in his hands, is no anchor. Now, with Bespoken Dream, Kane's myth-making reaches new heights. Details remain tightly under wraps, but early hints suggest the show will be his most intricate yet‚Äîa celebration of fine tailoring and fantasy told through an all-sensory spectacle. Set within the lush, dimly-lit corridors of The Mandrake, it promises couture not just worn, but performed. His fabric, famously woven exclusively in the UK, will be center stage. Each thread, each trim, painstakingly custom‚Äîan anthem of Kane's commitment to heritage and rebellion in equal measure. The show also coincides with a series of public studio events later this year‚Äîrare open hours where clients and collectors alike can glimpse the inner workings of Kane's atelier, perhaps even catch him mid-drape or deep in discussion with his creative team. That proximity is rare in a fashion world often hidden behind PR gates, but then again, Kane has always done things differently. Among those who've worn his designs: Rod Stewart, Jack Whitehall, Jason Momoa, and Tom Holland. His garments have graced the small screen via Bridgerton, She-Hulk, and Frontier. Yet for Kane, the celebrity name-drop has always taken a back seat to craftsmanship. ‚ÄúMy goal was never to be famous,‚Äù he once said. ‚ÄúIt was to make clothes that speak for themselves.‚Äù And speak they do. Whether standing still on a mannequin or flying down a runway surrounded by fog and violins, a Joshua Kane piece is unmistakable. This is fashion that doesn't whisper. It narrates. It dreams. And come July 16, it returns‚Äîwith a vengeance. Joshuakanebespoke.com"

Burberry, known for its trademark trench coats and check pattern scarves, is in the early stages of a reboot as Schulman tries to reverse the group's years of underperformance and return sales and profit to growth. Analysts expect the group to report on Friday that comparable retail sales fell 3% in the April-June quarter from a year earlier, according to a consensus provided by Burberry. That would mark an improvement from a 6% fall in the January-March period. Burberry issued a string of profit warnings under previous CEO Jonathan Akeroyd, and Schulman after taking over said the brand had lost its focus on outerwear and recognisable British references, and had strayed too far into a ""niche aesthetic"". Its shares are up around 63% since Schulman took the helm, outperforming luxury peers, and analysts have grown more upbeat in recent weeks, with HSBC saying Burberry has the opportunity to gain market share from rivals. ""We are seeing the improvement in terms of the product range, pricing, marketing, and there are early signs that is leading to a pickup in sales ‚Äì but it's early days still,"" said Dan Carter, a member of the investment team at Phoenix Asset Management Partners in London. Burberry's marketing under Schulman has drawn on its association with British heritage, but in a way that is also contemporary, Carter added. Burberry typically makes more of its revenue in the autumn/winter season. However, it has been trying to tap into key events of the British summertime, with its most recent ""Burberry Festival"" campaign timed to coincide with Glastonbury music festival. The campaign featured hip-hop artist Loyle Carner and music producer Goldie, as well as model Cara Delevingne sitting in a pit of mud in Burberry rain boots, in a nod to Glastonbury's unpredictable weather. ""They're a brand that is focusing on outerwear and protection against the weather... so to try and stretch that through the year makes sense,"" said Carter. As part of its turnaround, Burberry announced in May it would cut a fifth of its global workforce, a radical cost-cutting move that investors have welcomed. LESS EXPENSIVE BAGS, MORE HIGH-END TRENCHES The brand has moved away from high-priced bags and brought in more affordable models like its recently launched Cotswold range, priced at 1,490 pounds to 1,890 pounds ($2,012.99 to $2,553.39), and the 850-pound Horseshoe crossbody bag - driving its average bag price down by 9% since the start of October last year, according to pricing analysis by Luxurynsight. ""They're kind of trying to thread the needle of being luxury while shifting the assortment down a little bit,"" said Brett Sharoni, senior analyst at Pzena Investment Management in New York, which owns shares in Burberry. ""We had been engaging with Burberry for over a year before we ended up buying - and one of our big pieces of feedback to them was, you know, you don't really have a right to sell handbags for $3,000,"" he said. Burberry has, though, brought in some higher-priced outerwear products such as a 115,000 yuan ($16,044.65) corduroy trench coat in China, Luxurynsight found, and has broadened its range of outerwear products by 22% since the start of October last year. Yumi Shin, chief merchandising officer at New York department store Bergdorf Goodman, said she supports the emphasis on the brand's trademark products, like the classic trench coat and winter accessories.

Burberry, known for its trademark trench coats and check pattern scarves, is in the early stages of a reboot as Schulman tries to reverse the group's years of underperformance and return sales and profit to growth. Analysts expect the group to report on Friday that comparable retail sales fell 3% in the April-June quarter from a year earlier, according to a consensus provided by Burberry. That would mark an improvement from a 6% fall in the January-March period. Burberry issued a string of profit warnings under previous CEO Jonathan Akeroyd, and Schulman after taking over said the brand had lost its focus on outerwear and recognisable British references, and had strayed too far into a ""niche aesthetic"". Its shares are up around 63% since Schulman took the helm, outperforming luxury peers, and analysts have grown more upbeat in recent weeks, with HSBC saying Burberry has the opportunity to gain market share from rivals. ""We are seeing the improvement in terms of the product range, pricing, marketing, and there are early signs that is leading to a pickup in sales ‚Äì but it's early days still,"" said Dan Carter, a member of the investment team at Phoenix Asset Management Partners in London. Burberry's marketing under Schulman has drawn on its association with British heritage, but in a way that is also contemporary, Carter added. Burberry typically makes more of its revenue in the autumn/winter season. However, it has been trying to tap into key events of the British summertime, with its most recent ""Burberry Festival"" campaign timed to coincide with Glastonbury music festival. The campaign featured hip-hop artist Loyle Carner and music producer Goldie, as well as model Cara Delevingne sitting in a pit of mud in Burberry rain boots, in a nod to Glastonbury's unpredictable weather. ""They're a brand that is focusing on outerwear and protection against the weather... so to try and stretch that through the year makes sense,"" said Carter. As part of its turnaround, Burberry announced in May it would cut a fifth of its global workforce, a radical cost-cutting move that investors have welcomed. LESS EXPENSIVE BAGS, MORE HIGH-END TRENCHES The brand has moved away from high-priced bags and brought in more affordable models like its recently launched Cotswold range, priced at 1,490 pounds to 1,890 pounds ($2,012.99 to $2,553.39), and the 850-pound Horseshoe crossbody bag - driving its average bag price down by 9% since the start of October last year, according to pricing analysis by Luxurynsight. ""They're kind of trying to thread the needle of being luxury while shifting the assortment down a little bit,"" said Brett Sharoni, senior analyst at Pzena Investment Management in New York, which owns shares in Burberry.
