mxs4f6h,2025-06-14 18:24:23,en,REDDIT,"  Yeah I've personally never been a fan of noon, Amazon is much more consistent and the returning process is very convenient. Bought all sorts of stuff and returned a handful of them (a mechanical keyboard, a whole ass monitor). I got Fakhar Lattafa (decent), Rasasi Shuhrah (Nuclear and very cheap), and Qaed Al Fursan (decent and very cheap) from Amazon and they were all completely fine. Just make sure that the product is fulfilled by Amazon and sold by either the company themselves or their official distributor (e.g. Sterling for Armaf)."
mxs6i3u,2025-06-14 18:35:30,en,REDDIT,"  I think Lattafa's main website isn't significantly more expensive than Amazon (compared to Rasasi and Armaf), but it's still cheaper on the latter. It's quite a mystery, probably sales or Amazon trying to drive people towards their website? Dunno, but I'll take advantage of it."
mxusffb,2025-06-15 03:54:37,en,REDDIT,  They smell great i would return the jpg and just get lattafa the kingdom cause i stg its the same or better and 27 on amazon but yeah thats just me
mxux5l2,2025-06-15 04:30:18,en,REDDIT,"  The only Lattafa frag Ive gotten that I actually really enjoy is Emeer. Oh, actually, Al Nashama Caprice is okay as well. A lot of the others I find have an unwanted aldehydic tinge. You'd prolly have better luck in r/fragranceclones"
mxv1aqj,2025-06-15 05:03:24,en,REDDIT,"  I'm from the UK, I've not found any actual walk in stores that sell Lattafa and I've not had any issues at all yet even if they hadnt come direct from Amazon but a 3rd party despite listed on Amazon"
mxv4vmq,2025-06-15 05:33:25,en,REDDIT,"  Ok yeah if you're into Khamrah because it's cozy, I'd try Ameer. It's pretty sweet and cozy. I also have Shagaf Oud by Swiss Arabian (not Lattafa) and that one is also a cozy sweet smokey scent with more depth and maybe less familiarity than BTF would. I'd def recommend it and it's not expensive from when I purchased it last granted that was probably 2022…"

mxw5rzi,2025-06-15 11:27:45,en,REDDIT,"  If you're in America, I strongly suggest checking out r/MontagneParfums. The difference in quality is night and day. I know I sound like a “shill” but just go read there and see what everyone says. Lattafa/Armaf/Dua/Alt etc have some okayish stuff, and even a couple gems. For the most part though I've just been disappointed with their stuff. Anyways, I haven't looked back since I found em. If I want it & Montagne makes it, I'm going Montagne 99% of the time."

1ld1lgy,2025-06-16 19:04:23,en,REDDIT,"  So when I first started collecting fragrances I avoided anything with jasmine and tuberose and gardenia . . and heck even rose. . I stuck with mostly 'clean skin scent' fragrances or vanilla or fruity or spicy and woody. I think the most floral I got would have been purple florals like violet and Iris which I've always liked but to me they don't smell very floral. I could tolerate Jasmine in the background as long as it isn't prominent. But even with a Gourmand if there was a strong floral note in it I didn't like it. For example at first I didn't like Devotion because of the orange blossom. (Now I love it) But I really think with my sense of smell sometimes I get stuck in a certain scent profiles, and then when I depart from that I don't like it so I tried to experiment more with florals,  then one day I tried Nishane Hundred Silent Ways on a tester strip at the store, and I loved it and I ended up trying it on my skin and I loved it even more. . even though tuberose is the main floral in it which surprised me how much I liked it. Maybe just that day was the day I liked tuberose lol. I was sitting there thinking wait a sec I thought I don't like tuberose why is this so good. . Well it turns out that one fragrance after I bought a decant of it has made my sense of smell much more open to things with tuberose, and even Jasmine in them when the note is prominent since to me they have many similarities. I find myself enjoying a lot more fragrances now I'm not scared off if they are floral heavy. I still am not a big fan of sort of vintage aldehydes or indolic florals but there's so many good modern ones that I've been missing out. I admit though it's kind of hard to bounce from wearing vanilla Gourmand or fruity fragrances into wearing florals it feels like you need time to ...adjust almost? But I'm curious for anyone else have you ever done a complete ""about face"" on a certain note or family of notes because you loved a certain fragrance so much that had it, to where you know appreciated it more in other fragrances, like for me with Hundred Silent Ways ? The other one I am totally in love with is Printtemps Blanc which is super floral heavy. . and also lattafa atheeri. And Paris corner vanilla and roses."

mov_DFCB7B2B50BA39AB3B950ADFF9EC05FB,2025-06-17 01:31:02,en,WEB,"  Once you try this holy grail tinted sunscreen and birthday cake lip balm, ""bandwagon"" will be your middle name. Fun fact: Amazon has an ""Internet Famous"" section curated with TikTok-viral products. Here are a few of the current ones so beloved by reviewers that they are *definitely* worth the hype: 1. A delightfully affordable instant foot peeling spray for anyone ready to go full YEEHAW!! on that at-home pedicure. This not only helps gently remove dead skin, but moisturizes dry and cracked heels, so you'll really get some refreshing bang for your buck. Promising review: ""This product delivers exactly as promised and is incredibly easy to use. I suffer from dry skin and often apply various products to soften my feet. With this, I simply spray it on and immediately massage it in with my hands. The dead skin comes off effortlessly. There's no waiting time, and it's gentle on the skin. It leaves my feet feeling exceptionally soft. This has quickly become my new favorite thing."" —KimT Price: $5.48 2. Lumify Eye Drops, a product so beloved by TikTok that despite being more $ than other brands, it's the number one selling brand on Amazon right now. Reviewers swear by this for instant reduction in redness in their eyes, with visible differences within a minute of use. Learn more about different kinds of eye drops and what they can do at Cleveland Clinic. Note that eye drops can potentially mask symptoms of eye conditions, so you should talk to your eye doctor about what's right for you. And according to Mayo Clinic, you should avoid redness-reducing drops if you're looking for dry eye relief. Promising review: ""I have a big spot of blood vessels in the inner corner of my left eye. I use the expensive lubricant eye drops for moisture — I've used Visine, Clear Eyes, you name it. No eye drop has made my eyes look this great. Only Lumify! I was soo happy when I looked in the mirror and saw some beauty in my eyes instead of darkness and redness."" —Angela Leonard Price: $11.93 3. La Roche-Posay Anthelios SPF 40 Tinted Sunscreen, aka the ""holy grail"" of tinted sunscreens — reviewers love this lightweight, buildable formula so much that a lot of them replaced their foundation with it altogether. If you're in the market for some subtle but effective coverage that won't get goopy or settle in pores, this is your sunscreen match made in heaven. Psst, you can find the Attitude Oceanly Lip Balm that reviewer is wearing on Amazon! Note that the AAD recommends using at least SPF 30 and reapplying as needed for skin protection. You can read about sunscreen myths and facts from dermatologists for more information! Promising review: ""Like a lot of women over 50 I prefer to use a tinted sunscreen instead of foundation these days. I have tried a dozen, and this one is the winner, hands down! It has a thin, non-greasy texture, no odor, and is lightweight and buildable if you want a little more coverage in certain areas. Best of all it does not settle in to pores or fine lines at all. So many of the others I've tried, including high-end expensive ones that are pushed heavily on social media, are greasy and settle into every pore and line. I've put this on auto ship and hope it never gets discontinued!"" —Chartwell Price: $39.99 (available in four tinted and non-tinted) 4. Lottabody's Coconut Oil Foaming Curl Mousse designed for all hair types to give you satisfyingly hydrated, volumized, frizz-free curls at a FRACTION of the price of its competitors. Promising review: ""I have super frizzy, curly hair and live in New England, where we have super humid summers. I have been struggling to find a product that de-frizzes my hair without making it look oiled down, and this is it. I put it in my wet hair after washing, towel dried, and put my hair in a ponytail to go to work. My hair was frizz-free all night — even working outside in high humidity. People even asked if I did something to my hair!..."

To answer your question 9pm rebel gave me around 6 hours on skin and preformed very well. It is a strong fragrance so you will go nose blind but I promise everyone around you can smell it. But In my opinion I would say get qaed al fursan as the dry down smells the same as the opening and also lasted longer on my skin, not to mention you can get it for less than $20 on amazon!"
mylrwrp,2025-06-19 09:46:35,en,REDDIT,"  See you are in office and you are wearing Hawas that is the first thing you did wrong if you want to get noticed , like i'd rather like to not get noticed with Hawas lol while i have not even sniffed it once . I am saying this because it is the same invictus style DNA while i respect the OG it is mass pleasing it is very well done but it is generic and like you said people with edge got edge umm everyone smells the same :P . You know i wear invictus or one of its clone that i got which is Lattafa hayyati once in a while when i'm hanging out with really young people or even sometimes alone and i love how salty/musky/ambergreasy invictus get as the scent transitions personally i like that but i will never use it in office. You are wrong when you said to not use expensive/ moderately expensive fragrances in the office . Stop thinking about compliments just wear your shit and do your work stay laser focused and in your vibe . . wear your fragrance and not let it wear you off . Time you spend with a fragrance is more of a personal experience like I will never ever feel-good wearing Edge at this point of time in life, but I certainly appreciate people who like it that means they like the DNA and everyone with time will up their fragrance game all blessings to all the readers. I suggest you to get some good decants of ME fragrances and designers also make the best use of your budget as it is important to feel good while you are working and again fragrance is a personal experience on top of everything so quality matters , discover what else you like mate. Some random fragrances that came to my mind for you is Eros flame EDP , Mr. Burberry EDP, eau intense vetiver Hermes , Valentino Uomo Intense 2021. Peace"

My son loves his fragrances and bought Khamrah Qahwa EDP by Lattafa. It's a unisex fragrance and  includes notes of: Cardamom, ginger, white flowers, vanilla, coffee, tonka bean, and musk. This makes it a warming and comforting fragrance, striking, strong, and long-lasting. And yes....I wear this myself although my son would call it theft not sharing!!!

Są zmysłowe, intensywne i trwałe, jakby zamykały w szklanej buteleczce całą duszę Bliskiego Wschodu. A teraz ten sekret Arabek możesz mieć pod ręką – i to za jedyne 58,99 zł. Właśnie tyle kosztują teraz perfumy LATTAFA Ana Abiyedh Rouge w promocji w Rossmannie. Zjechały z niemal stówki, a pachną jak luksus za kilka stówek więcej. Jeśli klasyczne zapachy wydają się nudne i ulotne, czas sięgnąć po coś, co naprawdę zostawia ślad. Ten ogoniasty zapach nie tylko przyciąga uwagę, ale trzyma się skóry i ubrań nawet przez 10 godzin. I choć to uniseks, to wielu zachwyconych recenzentów mówi jasno: ten flakon to must-have dla każdej miłośniczki intensywnych, kobiecych woni. [Arabskie perfumy Lattafa za grosze? W Rossmannie znajdziesz luksus, który pachnie przez 10 godzin] Jeśli jeszcze nie znasz marki Lattafa Perfumes, pora nadrobić. To jeden z największych graczy na rynku arabskich perfum. Marka pochodzi z Dubaju i jest specjalistą w łączeniu nowoczesnych trendów z klasyczną sztuką arabskiego perfumiarstwa. Jej znakiem rozpoznawczym są intensywne, długotrwałe zapachy o niezwykle bogatym składzie. Wszystko zamknięte w eleganckich flakonach, które równie dobrze mogłyby stać na półce z ekskluzywnymi markami niszowymi. Ana Abiyedh Rouge to jeden z najbardziej popularnych zapachów Lattafa. Kompozycja przyciąga uwagę już od pierwszej nuty – świeżość bergamotki i gruszki Nashi przełamana zostaje egzotycznym kumkwatem. Potem wkracza serce zapachu, gdzie rządzi karmel i geranium – słodko, ale nie duszno. A baza? Tu dzieje się magia: mech dębowy, piżmo i ambra tworzą ogon, który zostaje z tobą naprawdę długo. To perfumy, które wciąż czujesz na ubraniach następnego dnia. [Dlaczego warto postawić na arabskie perfumy Lattafa?] Arabskie perfumy mają zupełnie inną konstrukcję niż te z europejskich perfumerii. Są bardziej skoncentrowane, intensywniejsze i tworzone na bazie olejków, dzięki czemu ich trwałość znacznie przewyższa przeciętne zapachy z drogerii. Marka Lattafa to synonim luksusu dostępnego na każdą kieszeń. Nie musisz wydawać majątku, żeby pachnieć jak milion dolarów. Flakon Ana Abiyedh Rouge nie tylko wygląda pięknie, ale zawiera perfumy, które spokojnie wytrzymują cały dzień w pracy, wieczór z przyjaciółmi i randkę po zmroku. W cenie 58,99 zł to absolutny hit – szczególnie że wcześniej kosztowały 99,99 zł. [Gdzie kupić arabskie perfumy Lattafa?] Rossmann to jeden z niewielu sklepów stacjonarnych, gdzie znajdziesz arabskie perfumy od Lattafa. Warto sprawdzać promocje, bo często można dorwać perełki za połowę ceny. W przypadku Ana Abiyedh Rouge to właśnie teraz idealny moment – pachniesz luksusowo, płacisz grosze. Jeśli nie masz jeszcze swojego flakonika, biegnij po niego, zanim zniknie z półek. Te perfumy robią furorę na TikToku i w beauty-grupkach – i trudno się temu dziwić.."

mynk6jx,2025-06-19 16:14:16,en,REDDIT,"  Some of my favorite affordable fragrances that smell higher end. Now my disclaimer is that I wear whatever scents I want all year long so I'm not always the best at saying what's good in warm vs cold weather 😂 I also recommend spraying your clothes if you don't mind doing that. Bath and Body Works Midnight Temptation, pair it with the lotion to up longevity. It's very similar to Black Opium Le Parfum. Just spray the heck out of your body and clothes. Sol De Janeiro the edt paired with 62 body spray. This is actually a summer scent for me, so I get the 8ml in the edt and a small body spray, theis will be about $40 to $50 for both, but the sprays go on sale a lot. If you can swing a small bum bum cream and the glow oil, I highly recommend. This is a compliment getter! I wouldn't recommend blind buying but a lot of Mancera perfumes are crazy strong. I got a 4oz of Roses vanille on Jomashop for $60ish. I've barely made a dent cuz she's strong! Lattafa Liam Grey less than $25 for 100 ml bottle. This is a dupe for BDK Gris Chanel, but it's stronger and longer lasting. This smells like money, but I would recommend testing out the OG to see if you like that scent DNA. Adam Levine, around $15 but I've seen it way lower. This smells way more expensive than what it is and it projects. Avon Imari Elixir. It smells niche. You can find it on EBay with free delivery for less than  $15. If you are a fan of roses- French Avenue Rose Explosion. This is like being at the flower shop and you walk in right as they are cutting down the rosettes to make a bouquet, you smell  fresh petals, leaves, and stems. It's a dupe for atomic rose. $22 on Amazon Paris Hilton Gold Rush pair it with the body spray. It smells really good, the best in the line. You can get both, 100 ml perfume and 8oz spray for less than $40 on Amazon. Guess Seductive Noir. So good. Very similar to Mon Guerlain. $22 for a 2.5 0z bottle and $13 for the body spray on Amazon. People rave about this fragrance and it deserves all the hype! Narciso Rodriguez has a lot of great perfumes $60 or under. I really like For Her edt and Musc Noir Rose (this would probably be too musky), the projection is good on both, stays on clothes until you wash them. Lattafa Mayar Natural Intense. A freshy that projects and has some longevity. $20 on Amazon. Lattafa Angham. This is beautifully done. And it projects and lasts longer than Burberry Goddess. $30ish on Amazon. Lastly if you really want to project and you don't get headaches try Ciara by Revlon. She's strong and surprisingly unique. Less than $15 on Amazon. You can probably find some of these even cheaper but Im addicted to 2 day shipping"

Szukacie jednak czegoś lekkiego, przeznaczonego na lato? Mgiełka perfumowana w nutach gourmand pozwoli na chwile zapomnienia. To elegancki zapach, który przenosi w klimaty Dubaju. Jeżeli chcecie pachnieć, jak żony szejków i kusić słodyczą baklawy, ta mgiełka z Superpharm jest dla was. [Al Wataniah Perfumowana mgiełka do ciała, Pistachio Musk — jak pachnie?] Perfumowana mgiełka znajduje się w pięknym, ornamentowym opakowaniu. Atomizer świetnie rozpyla ją, tworząc „deszczowy płaszcz”, który otula ciało. Zapach jest ciepły, stonowany i bardzo elegancki. To nie nachalny słodziak, lecz wyrafinowany luksus na wyciągnięcie ręki! Soczysta pomarańcza miesza się z korzennym kardamonem i pistacją, tworząc mariaż doskonały. Natomiast w trakcie dłuższej projekcji możemy wyczuć piwonię, która dopiero zaczęła kwitnąć na polskich ROD-osach. Całość jest otulona ciepłym piżmem z wanilią, przez co ma dość apetyczna woń. [Nuty zapachowe perfumowanej mgiełki] Złożone nuty zapachowe tej perfumowanej mgiełki sprawiają, że to idealny zapach dla pań, które szukają ciepłych i nieco kremowych akordów: - Nuty głowy: pomarańcza, kardamon, ananas, zielone nuty, pistacja, - Nuty serca: nuty kwiatowe, piwonia, mleko - Nuty bazy: nuty drzewne, krem, piżmo, wanilia - Typ: gourmand (apetyczny), kwiatowy, waniliowy To słodkawy zapach, który pozwala na chwilę oddechu. Nuty cytrusowe łagodzą jego projekcję i pozwalają na wyłonienie się kwiatów piwonii. Kardamon, piżmo i wanilia są na tyle delikatne, że nie przytłoczą podczas letnich wieczorów swoim pudrowym akcentem. [Te arabskie perfumy gourmand są tanie i pachną kilkanaście godzin] Chcecie, aby zapach utrzymywał się znacznie dłużej? Aromat ciepłych bułeczek czy chrupiącej kajzerki to wasz faworyt? Arabskie perfumy Lattafa Brioche Vanille otula jak żadne inne przez długie godziny. A może kochacie woń nadziewanej czekolady, w której kryje się brzoskwiniowy dżem? To esencja Lattafa Afeef, który zniewoli każdego fana słodkości. Wybrzmiewają doskonale na ciele, jak i na ubraniach — jedwabna apaszka będzie nimi pachniała przez kilka dni, kusząc zapachem nie tylko kobiety, ale i mężczyzn."

mov_61D6FED86E14629FE1F9D2D72E1E21EE,2025-06-20 15:09:38,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]Eclair Lattafa, il profumo dolce e gourmand che ricorda i sentori della patisserie francese. Confronto con Biancolatte Ci sono fragranze che piacciono e non piacciono, gusti olfattivi che variano a seconda della temperatura, del periodo dell'anno, dell'umore. Lattafa Eclaire è uno dei profumi più venduti sulla nuova piattaforma di acquisto interattiva TikTok Shop e sta facendo molto parlare di se per il suo rapporto qualità prezzo. L'associazione delle sue note dolcissime a base di vaniglia, caramello, cioccolato e quella generosa base di burro che rende tutta la pâtisserie un sogno goloso, risponde alla tendenza di neuromarketing che infonde sapore di cibo. È stato lanciato nel 2024 gourmand ricco di caramello, latte e vaniglia, che ricorda i biscotti e i dolci tipici della tradizione francese voluttiosi e dolci. Per questa capacità di attivare la sfera del gusto viene spesso paragonato a Biancolatte di Giardini di Toscana, una delle fragranze più popolari dello scorso anno che continua ad avere un grande successo. Lattafa Eclaire Eau De Parfum Note e caratteristiche del goloso profumo Il nome del bignè fatto di morbida pasta choux, ripieno di crema pasticcera alla vaniglia o al cioccolato e ricoperto di glassa significa “lampo” proprio perché è talmente buono che si divora in pochi secondi e anche la fragranza che ne prende il nome possiede la stessa velocità comunicativa. È un profumo che si fa sentire, con lunga persistenza e una scia ampia, che rimane presente nel tempo, anche sui vestiti dopo qualche lavaggio. Si apre con note di latte, caramello e zucchero, un'esplosione zuccherina immediata a primo fiuto, stabilizzata dalle note centrali di miele e fiori bianchi, estremamente popolari nelle costruzioni olfattive gourmand. Sul fondo, si percepiscono note muschiate accompagnate da una vaniglia profonda e una stuzzicante pralina nocciolata. Collegarlo al profumo avvolgente del pasticcino francese morbido, voluttuoso ma allo stesso tempo leggero e goloso, è facilissimo. Un profumo intrigante come un gelato a fine serata, rotondo e ricco che sicuramente può non piacere a chi preferisce le più leggere fragranze al limone o ai fiori bianchi. eclairs with white glaze and poppy seeds close upAnton Dobrea Perché è il più venduto I suoi punti di forza principali sono la persistenza, anche se gli esperti di fragranze consigliano sempre di non giudicare un profumo dalla sua durata ma dalla qualità delle materie prime, il suo prezzo accessibile ed un packaging elegante. Molte recensioni dicono anche che «crea dipendenza» data la componente lattonica che secondo il neuromarketing va a stimolare nell'amigdala, situata nel sistema limbico che gioca un ruolo chiave nell'elaborazione delle emozioni e dei ricordi le sensazioni piacevoli di ricordi di infanzia o sensazioni di benessere generate dalla felicità e spensieratezza degli anni da bambini. Sappiamo che odori come questi possono innescare risposte emotive intense e calmanti. Il confronto con Biancolatte Nonostante molti definiscano Eclair Lattafa il dupe di Biancolatte di Giardini di Toscana, dalla tabella si evincono somiglianze e differenze. È chiaro che la costruzione delle due fragranze sia praticamente la stessa nella parte di apertura con le classiche note gourmand e dolci che li accomunano, ma Eclair si ferma dove Biancolatte intesse una complessità maggiore insieme ad accordi legnosi, aromatici e muschiati dati da materie prime come la cumarina, un ingrediente sintetico che mima la molecola che compone gli odori della fava tonka, della cannella, della lavanda, dell'erba cipollina e della salvia, dolce ma allo stesso tempo erbacea e secca. Per l'estate Eclaire è più leggero mentre Biancolatte risulta, per i suoi maggiori livelli di composizione, più avvolgente e dunque pesante per la bella stagione. La differenza si nota anche nel punto prezzo, che per Eclair è di 36,10 euro su Amazon e per Biancolatte di Giardini di Toscana 125 euro.

Algunas fragancias logran un impacto tan fuerte que trascienden el nicho y se convierten en fenómenos virales. Tal es el caso del perfume árabe Sakeena, de la casa Lattafa Perfumes, que se convirtió en uno de los más buscados en Mercado Libre y en redes sociales como TikTok. Lanzado en 2022 y catalogado dentro de la familia floral frutal gourmand, este eau de parfum sorprende por su composición intensa y envolvente, a un precio mucho más accesible que otros perfumes de alta gama. Los usuarios lo describen como “adictivo”, “dulce y embriagador”, y “único en su tipo”. Perfume árabe ""Sakeena"" de Lataffa. Foto: Amazon. Sakeena ofrece una experiencia olfativa por capas, con una salida de mandarina, notas ozónicas y maracuyá, que luego evoluciona hacia un corazón más floral y salino. Allí aparecen acordes de frambuesa, rosa, flor de azahar y sal de mar, creando una fusión equilibrada entre lo dulce y lo fresco. Finalmente, el fondo se vuelve cálido y profundo, con notas de vainilla, praliné, almizcle y toffee, generando un efecto de duración prolongada en la piel. El resultado es una fragancia femenina, sensual y muy versátil ideal tanto para el día como para la noche, aunque muchos expertos la recomiendan especialmente para climas templados o fríos, como el otoño y el invierno.

Classic/vintage type perfumes always smell strong to me, I think because they had to compete with cigarette smoke. Such as Tabu, it's been reformulated a few times but this one is definitely mature but it's so strong. I do not wear it but I have a bottle because it reminds me of my grandma. Less than $15. Halston for women. Still gets really good reviews to this day, and has projection and longevity. Ciara by Revlon. She is extra strength. I still wear it to this day. Incensey and surprisingly unique. I'm sure the neighbors can smell it with just one spray! I love it! Less than $15. Fire and Ice by Revlon. I'm not sure how strong this really is, I just remember my mom choking me out with the stuff when she was getting ready to go out Mancera perfumes are notoriously strong. You can find them on grey market sites for around $70ish for 4oz bottles. I have Roses Vanille and sometimes I choke myself out because I tend to over spray. Lattafa Liam Grey. Strong and smells rich! Around $22. It's a dupe for BDK Gris Chanel but it's stronger and lasts longer. Rose Explosion by French Avenue, around $20. It's a 90% dupe for Atomic Rose. It's the whole rose in a fragrance and I find it quite strong and lovely. Lattafa Khamrah, any of them. Between $25 to $40. I don't find these overly strong, but some people do. The scent does last all day. Beautiful fragrances, so well done. Adam Levine for women. $14. Such a hidden gem. Great projection and staying power. Most of these I got from Amazon or Walmart, but you might be able to find them cheaper if you look around."

1lgio6f,2025-06-20 23:47:31,en,REDDIT,"  After finding out about actual clones, I've been intrigued and keep getting the cheaper ones to start off, but I'll admit I've been fairly happy. So far I got CDN Milestone and Lattafa Suqraat. I have Supremacy CE and Sceptre Malachite on the way from Walmart (had a $50 GC) and I can't wait. I have no idea how to properly describe fragrances, but I can say that CDN Milestone smells very fruity and sweet with a hint of musk, feels fruity in a manly way to me. My only somewhat complaint is that it doesn't project much, I spray on 4-6 sprays and I smell it for 30 minutes then it fades and I can only smell it on my skin or shirt directly. Made me think this wasn't a real cologne, but it's sold by Amazon and the packaging and bottle look like top tier fancy stuff so I'll somewhat trust it until I buy from discounters. Now Suqraat! $17 total blind buy from a seller on Amazon (fulfilled), this is powerful and to me it's unique. I feel like I've smelled something similar before but idk what it is. I will say initial spray gave me straight up Alcanfor that mom used to put on the corner of the room, and after 30 minutes from 1 spray it still smells that way, 1 hour later though and the cologne is fading fast even when sniffed on the skin. I don't dislike it, but does give me a little bit of “old man” vibe. I probably wouldn't go get another one, but I'll be wearing this here and there. So, what do you guys think of these two, and what should I get next (after Rayhaan Lion and CDNIM Parfum)?"

Zobacz, dlaczego Noble Blush podbija TikToka i półki Hebe. To jeden z najbardziej pożądanych zapachów tego sezonu. [Perfumy na lato. Jakie wybierać?] Lato nie znosi ciężkich zapachów. Gdy słońce grzeje, a powietrze drży od ciepła, potrzebujesz czegoś lekkiego, ale wyjątkowego. Najlepsze letnie perfumy to te, które pachną świeżością, kwiatami, może odrobiną cytrusów lub nutą kremowej słodyczy. To musi być zapach, który nie męczy, ale koi i orzeźwia w upalne dni. W wakacyjnych kompozycjach idealnie sprawdzają się: piwonia, róża, jaśmin, ale też mleczne, migdałowe i pudrowe akordy, które sprawiają, że zapach „przykleja się” do skóry jak miękka mgiełka. Jeśli szukasz właśnie takich nut, to mamy coś dla ciebie. [Luksusowe perfumy z Hebe. Pachną kwiatowo-migdałowo] Lattafa Badee Al Oud Noble Blush to woda perfumowana, która idealnie wpisuje się w klimat ciepłych dni. Już od pierwszego psiknięcia czuć, że nie jest to przypadkowa kompozycja. Wszystko tu gra: kremowy migdał, subtelna róża, odrobina piżma i nuty pudrowe. Są to najlepsze luksusowe perfumy w tak przystępnej cenie. Ten zapach zaczyna się bardzo miękko. Mleczno-migdałowa nuta otula jak kremowy balsam. Później pojawia się róża, delikatna, nie dusząca. A baza: czysta, z odrobiną drzewnych tonów i piżma, które dodają trwałości i lekkości jednocześnie. Co ciekawe, choć perfumy mają luksusowy charakter, kosztują znacznie mniej niż zapachy z ekskluzywnych perfumerii. A teraz, w Hebe, kupisz je z 30% rabatem. To naprawdę świetna okazja, jeśli chcesz pachnieć wyjątkowo, nie wydając fortuny: 120 zł za fiolkę. [Perfumy Lattafa Badee Al Oud Noble Blush. Jak wyglądają?] Nie da się przejść obojętnie obok tego flakonu. Różowy, matowy, z geometrycznym zdobieniem – wygląda jak luksusowy kosmetyk z francuskiej perfumerii. W środku 100 ml perfum woda, a całość zamknięta w eleganckim pudełku z przezroczystym okienkiem. To flakon, który z dumą postawisz na toaletce. Widać tu inspiracje orientem, ale bardzo nowoczesne, wręcz instagramowe. Pudrowy róż w połączeniu ze srebrzystym zdobieniem robią świetne wrażenie, zarówno na żywo, jak i na zdjęciach. Jeśli szukasz prezentu (nawet dla samej siebie), to ten flakon to pewniak. A za tę cenę, trudno znaleźć coś równie stylowego i dopracowanego. [Jak przedłużyć ich działanie na skórze?] Choć Noble Blush to perfumy o naprawdę niezłej trwałości (około 6–8 godzin na skórze), warto znać kilka trików, które pomogą wydłużyć ten efekt. - Nawilżenie - sucha skóra szybciej „zjada” zapach. Użyj bezzapachowego balsamu lub olejku przed aplikacją perfum. - Psikaj w ciepłe miejsca - nadgarstki, szyja, zgięcia łokci i kolan, za uszami. Tam, gdzie pulsuje krew, zapach rozwija się najpiękniej. - Nie rozcieraj - pozwól zapachowi się ułożyć. Rozcieranie niszczy kompozycję. - Delikatne spryskanie włosów lub ubrania - tylko ostrożnie, żeby nie zostawić plam. Ubrania (szczególnie naturalne tkaniny) dobrze trzymają zapach. - Nie przesadzaj z ilością - Noble Blush są wystarczająco intensywne. Dwa psiknięcia w zupełności wystarczą."

mzgss4i,2025-06-24 05:55:38,en,REDDIT,"  Perfumes are a nice hobby because how expensive it will be is entirely dependent on your choices in perfumes. Definitely not like watches, shoes, or something where it can become super expensive even for entry brands. Sometimes it depends on the brands of perfumes you buy. A lot of Middle Eastern brands, mainly Emirati, like Lattafa or Al Haramain usually create dupes/clones of the more expensive/mainstream fragrances that are pretty close to smelling like the real deal. It's not gonna be a hundred percent there obviously but they are still pretty good imo -- others in the perfume hobby may disagree with that though. Lattafa's fragrances, from my experience, can be bought for usually around 20-40 USD on sites like Fragrancenet. Also never buy perfumes from a retail store, Amazon etc. -- they up charge like hell. If you really want to experience the more expensive stuff you can always get smaller decants/samples of those fragrances for way cheaper. For example, a 3.4 oz bottle of Tom Ford is like 230 USD but you can get a 5 mL decant for like 25 bucks. Thats a quite extreme example because Tom Ford is ridiculously expensive but you get the idea. It's way more cost effective and 5 mL for me lasts like 4-5 months since I'm not using perfume every single day. Getting decants is also nice because you can sample way more perfumes without having to ""commit"" to certain fragrances."

I'm a huge fan of UAE fragrances and stumbled across this gem while exploring; it might look a wee bit dodgy but I assure you it is full of genuine Lattafa, Al Rehab and other houses, but it excels at its Lattafa stock (even air fresheners). I live in Ireland and have to order online and try samples etc because trying in store isn't an option. The guys in there are lovely and super helpful and they order directly from UAE. They said a lot of people order from tik top shops, Amazon etc and end up with fakes. I had a lot of fun sampling, and bought a few 50ml (travel restrictions ugh), notably Khamrah, Yara Tous and a Yara original roll on oil. The 50mls are £5 each people! No im not affiliated lol, I just had a great and surprising experience and wanted to share in case anyone is down there. It's a great shop for middle eastern fans!"

Preis vom 26.06.2025 07:35 Uhr Worauf du bei Sommerdüften achten solltest Sommerdüfte dürfen ruhig leichter und luftiger sein als ihre winterlichen Pendants. Ideal sind fruchtige, florale oder zitrische Noten, die nicht beschweren – wie bei dem Lattafa Orangen-Parfum. Besonders angenehm wirken Düfte mit frischer Kopfnote und weicher Basis, da sie sich bei Wärme sanft entfalten. Achte darauf, Eau de Toilettes oder leichte Eau de Parfums zu wählen, da sie oft dezenter sind und sich gut für den Alltag eignen. Wer empfindliche Haut hat oder Naturkosmetik bevorzugt, findet in veganen und alkoholfreien Alternativen eine schonende Lösung für den Sommer. Ein guter Sommerduft sollte nicht nur gut riechen, sondern auch ein Gefühl transportieren – Leichtigkeit, Wärme und Lebensfreude. Genau das gelingt mit den fruchtig-pudrigen und zitrischen Kompositionen von Lattafa Rave Now Pink. Ein perfekter Duft für herrliche Sommertage."

1lla7g0,2025-06-26 20:06:55,en,REDDIT,"  After seeing a whole bunch of heavy handed ""dos and don'ts"" floating around, I decided to do one of my own. Why not, right? Not really a bunch of advice, just a few things I do and saves me a lot of headache, time, and stress. These are habits/culture I have picked up/developed over time. I have been there 300 years ago when Muglers were considered affordable high end and clones were thought of as knock offs, and then CDNIM became this underground resistance, and now we are here. Hopefully this helps some of you **Blind buying is viable only when:** You have done a good amount of research and are *very* familiar with the scent profiles/accords from other fragrances. That is to say if you like fig on frag1, doesn't mean you will like it in frag 2. But if you have liked it in frags 1-3, you will probably like it in 4, if the reviews (a lot of them) are saying it is good. There is still a chance you might not, but after these two criteria, that gets slim. **Decants are great for elevating your fragrance game:** A lot of people think of it as waste, but if you are new and haven't sampled 100s of frags, get decants. I have used fragrancenet for a long time, and I have always filled out one or two decants to get free shipping (most decants are between 2-8 CAD, more expensive, but not when it saved me 12$ of shipping). There might be good local sellers selling decants, and there are international shippers with some good reviews as well. Once you have reached that level, your blind buying success will go up if that's your thing. Or keep getting decants. You do you. **AIs are a great tool for research:** Right now its almost exclusively Gemini. If you know how to talk to AI efficiently (like its the monkey's paw which also needs a very clear and short statements) you can save yourself hours and hours of research as it can crawl the forums, assign points, give you a summary, ranking, whatever you want. If you want, I can show you some examples **Buying off of Amazon/eBay is safe if you know where to look:** Check the sellers, check how far back the reviews go, and generally how positive they are. If you don't want to put in the work, get a browser add on like Fakespot **If you are looking for specific profiles:** You can use Parfumo/Frgrantica. Parfumo can be curated way more - [here](https://www.parfumo.com/s_perfumes_x.php?v=grid&filter=&b_id=2163%2C17122%2C13458%2C385%2C2549%2C1135%2C351%2C189%2C582%2C8997%2C1808%2C8692%2C2819%2C8430%2C7397%2C10107%2C18424%2C2019%2C14885%2C8487%2C13722%2C16792%2C18829%2C17719&m_id=&pf_id=&c_id=&n_inc_id=&n_exc_id=&nc_inc_id=&nc_exc_id=&t_id=&o=nr_desc&filter=&g_m=1&g_f=1&g_u=1&y_t=2&y_0=&y_1=0&y_2=0&y_3=&n_t=1&cl_35=0&cl_26=0&cl_13=0&cl_14=0&cl_38=0&cl_15=0&cl_16=0&cl_17=0&cl_18=0&cl_27=0&cl_31=0&cl_19=0&cl_20=0&cl_21=0&cl_22=0&cl_36=0&cl_37=0&cl_34=0&cl_33=0&cl_23=0&cl_24=0&cl_9=0&cl_10=0&cl_11=0&cl_12=0&cl_25=0&cl_6=0&cl_7=0&cl_32=0&cl_8=0&cl_5=0&cl_4=0&cl_3=0&cl_1=0&cl_2=0) is a list of filters with the clone brands I have used (there might be more but if I haven't used them, I didnt add them to the filter), just look for the note group you want and take it from there. Once you get a result, google the frag's notes to make sure the notes in parfumo weren't wrong **""Nuclear"" doesn't have to be a thing:** You are not likely to wear the same clothing for 10 hours+, so anything that pushes past 8-10 hours doesn't add that much value, at least to me. But anything that lasts longer, *likely* projects more as well, if its an EDP or the old school chemical warfare grade EDTs. Extraits are by design heavier to last longer, but with less alcohol, project less. Ideally, I want a few nuclears but I don't aim for most in my collection to be. **Always check multiple shops even if they are international:** Specially if you are buying multiple frags - chances are at the other retailer across the ocean is charging you twice for the shipping but their frags being cheaper will work out cheaper total order cost (for the sites that do duty paid shipping like Joma, Fragrancenet and FragranceX) **Don't discount smaller houses:** Armaf and Lattafa were once little known in NA. CDNIM used to cost 20$. There are new houses popping up (could be an old house previously not in the spotlight), relatively unknown but doing solid work. I recently got some Azhas for 20 CAD. These easily match most of my 30$ stuff. I'll review them in a week when they have matured - they are getting better every day. Not saying blind buy, just give them a chance. **Clone Perfumeries are your friend:** I make a distinction between mass production houses like Lattafa where they have a formula and mass producing them based on it. There's always going to be quality and batch variations. Smaller entities, like a perfumery that makes approximation is using the exact formula 1:1 they set as the recipe for a clone in every bottle. The quality will be higher on average. Cost is a different thing though...."

17978758169892630,2025-06-29 22:31:41,en,INSTAGRAM,"  Yesterday, I received my new perfume in the mail from Amazon - Sensuelle by Risala! This is the first ever Arabic fragrance I have added to my collection! I'm so excited to have more coming in the mail soon! I should be getting two arriving today and one on Monday. So far, I've bought this one, Yara, Haya & Rave Now, all three perfumes by the Arabic brand Lattafa. risala_perfumes_official Top Notes: Litchi, rhubarb, and tangerine. Middle Notes: Tropical fruits, peony, rose, and gourmand accord. Base Notes: Sandalwood, cashmeran, vanilla, and musk. First Impressions: The fragrance is a very girly & soft, fruity-floral sweet type of scent and the bottle is really pretty. It does project well, and I can easily smell myself with it on when I'm walking around outside in the sun. I've only worn it for a couple of hours, and it seemed to be holding up decently well. Update: After wearing for a few hours, it does fade away easily, so I recommend wearing it with a scented body lotion & body oil + Vaseline on pulse points to get it to last longer. It does, in fact, dry down to a more gourmand type of scent with the vanilla really shining through in the base. Also, it kind of smells like coconut with a really smooth velvety quality to it. So it might go great with some coconut scented body care products! (maybe Victoria's Secret Pink - Coco mist and lotion?) Honestly though, I was expecting a strawberry milkshake type of scent because of this one TikTok review that I watched where the girl said it smelled like that. Also, I didn't read the scent notes after to confirm if it had strawberry as an actual scent note or not, which is, of course, my own fault. I'd give it a 6.5/10 for the overall scent. I will be keeping it in my perfume collection and using it tonight as my bedtime scent! #risalasensuelle #risala #sensuelle #perfume #perfumebottle #perfumecollection #perfumelovers #perfumeaddict #perfumeaddicted #perfumeaddiction #arabic #arabicperfume #arabicfragrance #fragrance #fragrances #fragrancelover #fragrancecommunity #perfumereview #fragrancereviews #pink #pinkperfume #pinkaesthetic #pinkfragrance"

I'm so excited to smell it since it has notes of both strawberries and champagne! Fingers crossed that it's good! The bottle is also so pretty with all the gold and the pink rhinestone added to it. Also, the bottle itself is a velvety material, very fuzzy and soft. lataffaa Top Notes: Champagne, strawberry, tangerine, blood orange, and rose. Middle Notes: Gardenia, jasmine, and vanilla orchid. Base Notes: Amber, sandalwood, and chestnut. First Impressions: Immediately upon first spray to the skin, I smell the bright fruitiness, the bubbly champagne note, and the rose! Then it dries down with the floral notes standing out a bit more. (The vanilla orchid in particular). So far, it seems to project really well, and the scent is gorgeous.

Base Notes: Vanilla, musk, and moss. First Impressions: I really like the bottle, and it's a very pretty baby pink color. Upon first spray to bare skin, I definitely smell the red fruits and citrusy orange notes. When dried down, I can smell more of the marshmallow note, floral notes, and even the vanilla in the base. I really enjoy it! It's a very pretty & girly, bright, fruity-floral, and powdery gourmand scent. The more I smell it, I can detect the small amount of moss in the base.

Parent loss is always something that pulls at my heartstrings in books. The relationship Libby and Nora have as sisters is honestly very close and endearing. This really is a sister closeness relationship story with - 55% being about the sisters and 45% being about the romance with our man main character. I enjoy reading about sisters who are close, and these two have gone on a getaway trip to sunshine falls North Carolina where our other main character Charlie is from. Charlie and Nora have a bad business meeting over a book Nora asked Charlie to edit. Charlie is extremely rude in Nora's opinion about the book, but later finds out why he was so rude that day. As their relationship expands they turn from enemies, to lovers. This was the first book I've ever read to mention an actual fragrance. The fragrance is called book by commodity. They're both wearing the same one our two main characters, and it actually brings them together more. I love that so much! I have a fragrance collection, and the closest thing I have to the same notes as this is Liam by Lattafa. Both scents are woody, warm spicy, powdery, and green. Two book enthusiasts would wear a fragrance named book. Emily Henry mentions multiple different kinds of fragrances in the book, and how they bring up memories for the main character and that made me happy. This definitely had some spicy parts if that's your thing. It's an easy, light hearted, palette cleaner overall. I enjoyed it, and I'll be reading more from Emily Henry in the future.

This sub opened avenue of Decants for me and I'm so grateful for that , writing this review as a gesture to thank people who have helped me pull trigger on decants. Ordered this from whiff culture , delivered in 4 days so that's good I use to own full bottles before many hit and miss with likes of Nautica voyage, jaguar classic black , Versace eros ysl black opium etc etc Here mine 2 cents on this Khamrah Qahwa - too sweet , diabetic actually . This is more women leaning to me cuz of extra sweetness. Smells of nice toffee , apple pie , coffee to me. But It reacted badly with my odour and result was something very bad , nausetic i can say. Projects nice though and fills rooms. Fragrance are subjective and I won't reorder this. 7 / 10 9pm - my batch was weak actually , I apply this after work. This has some coconut smell in it in base notes , soothing and mellow. I don't care if it doesn't project or is beast mode. It is best suited for evening wear , applying this everyday after work. I get whiffs until late night. Will order full bottle and macerate it .8.5 / 10 Asad Boubon - bhai what is this juice. This is nuclear stuff. Short story i got 30 ml decant of this and end up applying more than I should. I got chronic headache had to visit doctor . It beast mode, compliments on day one. It has cacao note in drydown which is simply beautiful. Vanilla too which is awesome. But I won't order full bottle, it's toooooo loud, it's crazy. It don't want people to say hey this guy is walk in room freshner lol. I can handle eros edt loud but not this but yeah what a fragrance. 8.5 / 10, 10/ 10 for longevity and projection. Good job lattafa my next fav after black opium if I consider gourmand frags."

18053138567458760,2025-07-02 21:04:20,en,INSTAGRAM,"  Four days ago, I received my new perfume in the mail from Amazon - Sensuelle by Risala! (Eau de Parfum). This is the first ever Arabic fragrance I have added to my collection! I'm so excited to have more coming in the mail soon! I should be getting two arriving today and one on Monday. So far, I've bought this one, Yara, Haya & Rave Now, all three perfumes by the Arabic brand Lattafa. risala_perfumes_official Top Notes: Litchi, rhubarb, and tangerine. Middle Notes: Tropical fruits, peony, rose, and gourmand accord. Base Notes: Sandalwood, cashmeran, vanilla, and musk. First Impressions: The fragrance is a very girly & soft, fruity-floral sweet type of scent and the bottle is really pretty. It does project well, and I can easily smell myself with it on when I'm walking around outside in the sun. I've only worn it for a couple of hours, and it seemed to be holding up decently well. Update: After wearing for a few hours, it does fade away easily, so I recommend wearing it with a scented body lotion & body oil + Vaseline on pulse points to get it to last longer. It does, in fact, dry down to a more gourmand type of scent with the vanilla really shining through in the base. Also, it kind of smells like coconut with a really smooth velvety quality to it. So it might go great with some coconut scented body care products! (maybe vspink - Coco mist and lotion?) Honestly though, I was expecting a strawberry milkshake type of scent because of this one TikTok review that I watched where the girl said it smelled like that. Also, I didn't read the scent notes after to confirm if it had strawberry as an actual scent note or not, which is, of course, my own fault. I'd give it a 7/10 for the overall scent. I will be keeping it in my perfume collection and using it tonight for bed! #risalasensuelle #risala #sensuelle #perfume #perfumebottle #perfumecollection #perfumelovers #perfumeaddict #perfumeaddicted #perfumeaddiction #arabic #arabicperfume #arabicfragrance #fragrance #fragrances #fragrancelover #fragrancecommunity #perfumereview #fragrancereviews #pink #pinkperfume #pinkaesthetic #pinkfragrance #affordableperfumes #affordablefragrances #scentcombo"

This is the second Arabic fragrance that I will be adding to my collection! I'm so excited to smell it since it has notes of both strawberries and champagne! Fingers crossed that it's good! The bottle is also so pretty with all the gold and the pink gemstone added to it. Also, the bottle itself is a velvety material, very fuzzy and soft. lataffaa Top Notes: Champagne, strawberry, tangerine, blood orange, and rose. Middle Notes: Gardenia, jasmine, and vanilla orchid. Base Notes: Amber, sandalwood, and chestnut. First Impressions: Immediately upon first spray to the skin, I smell the bright fruitiness, the bubbly champagne note, and definitely the rose! Then it dries down with the floral notes standing out a bit more. (The vanilla orchid in particular). So far, it seems to project really well, and the scent is gorgeous. I could smell myself with this on when running errands, and it stayed pretty well after several hours of wearing. I would personally like to combine this fragrance with victoriassecret - Strawberries and Champagne mist + lotion! This scent gets a 7/10 from me! #lattafahaya #lattafa #haya #perfume #perfumebottle #perfumecollection #perfumelovers #perfumeaddict #perfumeaddicted #perfumeaddiction #arabic #arabicperfume #arabicfragrance #fragrance #fragrances #fragrancelover #fragrancecommunity #perfumereview #fragrancereviews #pink #pinkperfume #pinkaesthetic #pinkfragrance #affordableperfumes #affordablefragrances #scentcombo"

It's by the Arabic perfume brand Lattafa, and it's called Rave Now Eau de Parfum for women. This is the third Arabic fragrance I will be adding to my collection! The bottle itself is obviously plastic, with a dome shaped cap that says 'RAVE' on it. I'm really excited to spray it and give my first impression of what this smells like! lataffaa Top Notes: Red fruits, orange. Middle Notes: Marshmallow, jasmine, and lily of the valley. Base Notes: Vanilla, musk, and moss. First Impressions: I really like the bottle, and it's a very pretty baby pink color. Upon first spray to bare skin, I definitely smell the red fruits and citrusy orange notes. When dried down, I can smell more of the marshmallow note, floral notes, and even the vanilla in the base. I really enjoy it! It's a very pretty, bright, and powdery fruity-floral gourmand scent. The more I smell it, I can detect the small amount of moss in the base. But not enough of a moss scent to ruin the sweetness for me! This fragrance also seems to project really well and has great staying power. Since I want to actually bring out more of the vanilla note in the fragrance, I would probably pair this with victoriassecret - Bare Vanilla body mist & lotion! I think I actually like this scent better than the Lattafa - Haya. Overall, I give the scent and lasting power a 7/10! #lattafaravenow #lattafa #ravenow #perfume #perfumebottle #perfumecollection #perfumelovers #perfumeaddict #perfumeaddicted #perfumeaddiction #arabic #arabicperfume #arabicfragrance #fragrance #fragrances #fragrancelover #fragrancecommunity #perfumereview #fragrancereviews #pink #pinkperfume #pinkaesthetic #pinkfragrance #affordableperfumes #affordablefragrances #scentcombo"

This is now the fourth Arabic perfume I have in my fragrance collection! This is the most popular and most reviewed Lattafa fragrance on TikTok and YouTube. I will be giving my first impressions on this scent and what my nose picks up on the most. lattafa Top Notes: Orchid, heliotrope, and tangerine. Middle Notes: Gourmand accord, tropical fruits. Base Notes: Vanilla, musk, and sandalwood. First Impressions: Upon spraying this twice into the plastic cap, I immediately smell the floral notes and get a very powdery vibe from it as well. Then the vanilla and musk come out from the base. It's a very pretty scent but definitely not a ""Strawberry Milkshake-y"" scent like everyone is saying. Once again, I've been fooled by the reviews and didn't check the scent notes before buying to confirm if it actually had a strawberry note in it or not. I do still enjoy this fragrance, and it will be a part of my everyday fragrance rotation. I give it a 7/10 for the overall scent. The staying power and projecting power is decent. I'd give it 3-5 hours before having to re-apply! I would probably combine this fragrance with the new victoriassecret - Bare Vanilla Bliss mist and lotion! I will also say that this pairs well with Aquolina - Pink Sugar, as they both have that vanilla-y kind of sweetness! :) #lattafayara #lattafa #yara #perfume #perfumebottle #perfumecollection #perfumelovers #perfumeaddict #perfumeaddicted #perfumeaddiction #arabic #arabicperfume #arabicfragrance #fragrance #fragrances #fragrancelover #fragrancecommunity #perfumereview #fragrancereviews #pink #pinkperfume #pinkaesthetic #pinkfragrance #affordableperfumes #affordablefragrances #scentcombo"

Ideal sind fruchtige, florale oder zitrische Noten, die nicht beschweren – wie bei dem Lattafa Orangen-Parfum. Besonders angenehm wirken Düfte mit frischer Kopfnote und weicher Basis, da sie sich bei Wärme sanft entfalten. Achte darauf, Eau de Toilettes oder leichte Eau de Parfums zu wählen, da sie oft dezenter sind und sich gut für den Alltag eignen. Wer empfindliche Haut hat oder Naturkosmetik bevorzugt, findet in veganen und alkoholfreien Alternativen eine schonende Lösung für den Sommer. Ein guter Sommerduft sollte nicht nur gut riechen, sondern auch ein Gefühl transportieren – Leichtigkeit, Wärme und Lebensfreude. Genau das gelingt mit den fruchtig-pudrigen und zitrischen Kompositionen von Lattafa Rave Now Pink. Ein perfekter Duft für herrliche Sommertage."

1lqsk0s,2025-07-03 15:31:21,en,REDDIT,"  Hi everyone, I just wanted to make this post and get some insight if my Ameer Al Oudh is legit or not. I typically order Lattafa fragrances from Amazon (If the seller is Amazon itself) and they all seem to be legit until I got this. How I check if the fragrance is legit is through reviews and checking the batch code with a website like checkfresh.com. I also scanned the QRcode from the sticker and it took me to the official Lattafa website. But when I checked the batch code from the bottom of the packaging it came back as invalid. The rest of my Lattafa fragrances from Amazon returned data. While looking around on YouTube there are about 2 other instances where the batch code looked similar to mine and also returned invalid when I checked. The fragrance is still fairly new so maybe it hasn't been updated on the website yet. The perfume does perform decently where I still smelt it the next morning when I sprayed it on my wrist before going to bed. But smell wise, it's not as similar as I thought it would be  to By The Fireplace. Less Smokey, more sugary/sweet? Kinda reminds me of Pine Sap in a way? Maybe I'm tripping Maybe I just need to let the fragrance mature for a while and determine after if this is a good dupe or not."

mov_5F4EE16B4FC81F35F49A0CEA4346A422,2025-07-03 17:01:01,en,WEB,"  Oud is one of the most popular scents in the world, but for some perfume enthusiasts, its powerful presence can be intimidating. The Perfume Closet explains how to pick the right oud fragrance for you. (firmenpresse) - Sometimes called ""liquid gold,"" oud been cherished for centuries in Middle Eastern fragrance traditions and is now experiencing a renaissance in Western perfumery. Yet for some fragrance enthusiasts, oud—with its powerful presence and strong profile—can be intimidating. How do you choose the right oud fragrance that suits your personality and lifestyle? Interested in learning more about Arabian perfumes? You can find all the information you need at The Perfume Closet UK https://www.theperfumecloset.co.uk/product-category/brands/arabian-fragrances/ Understanding the Complexity of OudUnlike most perfume ingredients harvested from flowers, fruits, or spices, oud involves a more complex process. A resin, oud forms only when the Aquilaria tree becomes infected with a particular fungus, or when it's injured or infested by insects. The tree's defense mechanism produces a rich, resinous heartwood that, when distilled, yields one of perfumery's most precious ingredients. This origin story explains why genuine oud commands such extraordinary prices. Oud can cost around $5,000 per pound, a price point that has historically kept oud fragrances in the realm of luxury collections. Today, however, more accessible interpretations are emerging. The Oud Spectrum: Finding Your MatchWhat many fragrance newcomers don't realize is that oud isn't a single scent profile but rather a spectrum of aromatic possibilities. Traditional Deep Woods - At one end of the spectrum lies traditional oud with its profound depth. These fragrances showcase oud's natural characteristics: woody, slightly animalic, with subtle hints of leather and earth. They're uncompromising and authentic, best suited for those who appreciate heritage and want to experience oud in its most traditional form. Sweet Amber - Moving along, we encounter oud blended with amber and balsamic notes. These combinations soften oud's intensity while preserving its distinctive character, creating a warmer, more approachable profile that works beautifully in cooler weather. Smoke and Incense - Another traditional interpretation pairs oud with incense notes like frankincense and myrrh. These compositions suit evening wear and moments when you want something profound but not overwhelming. Contemporary Bright Citrus - Modern perfumers have discovered that pairing oud with bright citrus notes creates an unexpected but beautiful contrast. These blends juxtapose oud's depth against the sparkle of bergamot, lemon, or mandarin, making them perfect daytime options for oud enthusiasts. Gourmand Fusion - Another innovative direction blends oud with gourmand elements like vanilla, tonka bean, or even chocolate. These creations feel indulgent and comforting—ideal for those who appreciate sweetness but want something with more sophistication than typical dessert-inspired scents. Green Interpretation - Perhaps the most unexpected modern take introduces green notes alongside oud. Fresh herbs, violet leaf, or fig can transform oud into something surprisingly refreshing and versatile for everyday wear. Tips for Selecting Oud FragrancesDon't Rush the Decision - Unlike lighter fragrances that reveal themselves immediately, oud perfumes evolve significantly over time. What might seem overwhelming at first spray often settles into something much more nuanced after 30 minutes. A full day's wear may help you better judge an oud fragrance. Test on Your Skin: Oud interacts dramatically with individual skin chemistry. What smells divine on your friend might present completely differently on you. Factor in Seasonality - Heavier oud compositions that feel perfect in December might become cloying in July. Consider having different oud options for different seasons, or focus on lighter interpretations if you live in warmer climates. Overlooking Concentration - The concentration matters enormously with oud. An eau de toilette will present oud's character very differently than a parfum or attar. Higher concentrations aren't necessarily ""better""—they're simply different experiences. Finding Quality Without Breaking the BankWhile pure oud commands astronomical prices, quality oud fragrances don't have to empty your bank account. The key is understanding what you're paying for: Synthetic vs. Natural - Many excellent contemporary oud fragrances use high-quality synthetic oud accords that effectively replicate natural oud without the extreme price tag. These aren't ""fake"" but rather skilled interpretations that can be remarkably beautiful. Concentration and Longevity - A modestly priced oud fragrance with excellent longevity often represents better value than a more expensive option that fades quickly. UK retailers like The Perfume Closet understand this balance, offering options like their Luminous Oud that provides impressive longevity at accessible price points. The Blending Factor - Well-crafted blends where oud plays a supporting rather than starring role can offer exceptional value. These fragrances capture oud's magic without requiring massive quantities of raw material that drive up prices. Finding Your Oud Journey PartnerFinding a retailer that understands oud's complexities can transform your exploration from overwhelming to enjoyable. The Perfume Closet in Birmingham has built its reputation on guiding customers through the oud landscape with expertise and patience. With their expanded Arabian perfume collection featuring over 600 fragrances—including renowned houses like Lattafa and Ajmal alongside their own Luminous Oud creation—they exemplify the kind of knowledgeable guidance that makes oud accessible to newcomers and connoisseurs alike. ""We believe everyone should have the chance to discover their perfect oud fragrance,"" notes Saj, the founder. ""That's why we offer options across price points and encourage customers to take their time testing before committing.""..."

All the other three smelled incredibly synthetic even after letting it macerate for couple months. I've bought all of em from Amazon with more than 3k+ reviews. So why does it suck? And where else can I buy colognes from in case Amazon is fake."

1lr893b,2025-07-04 03:04:24,en,REDDIT,"  Hey everyone! Just wanted to take a moment to thank this amazing community, you've all helped me so much over the past few months. The passion, knowledge, and honest feedback here really guided me through my fragrance journey. In the last 4 months, I went all in tried over 150+ decants, visited a few local perfumeries, and explored and owned tons of perfume oils beyond what I'm sharing in this post. After a lot of research (and a bit of obsession), I ended up collecting these fragrances, and let's just say… it became quite the addiction! That said, I've decided to hit pause and not buy any more fragrances for the rest of the year (with one exception that might arrive in the next couple of days). I'll still be around and happy to help anyone here however I can. Thanks again for being such a great part of this journey! **Note**: I am not an expert , I trust my nose more than reviews, please do research or test fragrances before you buy, I am from Middle east / Asia English is not my native language, I apologize in advance for any mistakes i try to explain this in my words without using any AI or correction tool. I am reviewing all fragrances after giving them time to mature. From Top Left to Right: 1. **Icon by Dunhill**: Really Good citrusy, Aromatic and floral scent. A good alternative for those who don't like sweet or overly citrusy scents for summer. 2. **1 Million Prive:** The most complimented one on my list, absolutely amazing winter scent with sweet and tobacco notes; I failed to find anything that can beat that fragrance. 3. **1 Million Elixir:** Very sweet and creamy vanilla with colorful floral tones, especially on the dry down. Lasts a long time and projection is strong. **4. **   **Jasoor:** Clone of VUBIR Coral Fantasy Long Lasting with Good projection, Very Versatile for year-round wear except very hot evenings. **5. **   **Asad Bourbon:** Clone that covers VUBIR Intense, Most Wanted and Stronger with you. Smells cozy and rich. Feels confident and warm. **6. **   **Khamrah :** Amazing Scent, Sweet,  Warm , Cozy with Vanilla and amber. 7. **Khamrah Dukhan:** I tried Liquid Burn, and to my nose, it smells quite similar that same warm, spicy DNA. But Khamrah Dukhan was much cheaper, so I went for it. It's incredibly long-lasting and feels like a spicier, less sweet version of Khamrah. If the sweetness in the original Khamrah isn't your thing, this might be a better fit. Honestly, it's underrated and didn't get the recognition it deserves from early buyers or reviewers. This one needs more attention, it's a hidden gem. 8. **Alpine Homme Sport**: Clone of Allure Homme Sport, as a Sporty scent both last 4-5 hours, and it's enough for a sports session, very good gym scent. 9. **CDN Precieux:** Clone of Aventus Absolu with Twist, Great performance and quality scent better and smoother when compared with Supremacy CE but costs more and feel more expensive **10. ** **Mont Blanc Starwalker:** absolute masterpiece a good night time / bedtime scent. Calming and relaxing, Hyped for a reason very unique scent. **11. ** **Dunhill Desire for a man:** Apple, Citrus and Rose based scent, classic cheap summer scent suitable for any age. 12. **L'Homme by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of L'Homme Lacoste, long lasting, sweet, citrusy fresh scent. FD is a small local perfumery in my area. 13. **L'Homme Intense by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of Dior Homme Intense, Dior Homme intense clones were mostly sold out and its hard to get them in my country so i visited a local perfumery where they had this clone its using same french oils used by other clone houses. I tried it it was very long lasting so i bought the bottle, during testing it last 12+ hours on my skin. 14...."

A delightfully affordable instant foot peeling spray for anyone ready to go full YEEHAW!! on that at-home pedicure. This not only helps gently remove dead skin, but moisturizes dry and cracked heels, so you'll really get some refreshing bang for your buck. Promising review: ""This product delivers exactly as promised and is incredibly easy to use. I suffer from dry skin and often apply various products to soften my feet. With this, I simply spray it on and immediately massage it in with my hands. The dead skin comes off effortlessly. There's no waiting time, and it's gentle on the skin. It leaves my feet feeling exceptionally soft. This has quickly become my new favorite thing."" —KimT Price: $4.79 2. La Roche-Posay Anthelios SPF 40 Tinted Sunscreen, aka the ""holy grail"" of tinted sunscreens — reviewers love this lightweight, buildable formula so much that a lot of them replaced their foundation with it altogether. If you're in the market for some subtle but effective coverage that won't get goopy or settle in pores, this is your sunscreen match made in heaven. Psst, you can find the Attitude Oceanly Lip Balm that reviewer is wearing on Amazon! Promising review: ""Like a lot of women over 50 I prefer to use a tinted sunscreen instead of foundation these days. I have tried a dozen, and this one is the winner, hands down! It has a thin, non-greasy texture, no odor, and is lightweight and buildable if you want a little more coverage in certain areas. Best of all it does not settle in to pores or fine lines at all. So many of the others I've tried, including high-end expensive ones that are pushed heavily on social media, are greasy and settle into every pore and line. I've put this on auto ship and hope it never gets discontinued!"" —Chartwell Price: $39.99 (available in four tinted and non-tinted) 3.

Promising review: ""I have super frizzy, curly hair and live in New England, where we have super humid summers. I have been struggling to find a product that de-frizzes my hair without making it look oiled down, and this is it. I put it in my wet hair after washing, towel dried, and put my hair in a ponytail to go to work. My hair was frizz-free all night — even working outside in high humidity. People even asked if I did something to my hair! This is an amazing product for the price. Absolutely buying again and would recommend to anyone with a frizz issue."" —Marissa Price: $3.98 4. Clinique Almost Lipstick Tinted Lip Balm in *PINK* Honey — aka, the sweet, subtle sister of the iconic ""Black Honey"" that has been so popular over the past few decades that it just about broke TikTok when it finally had its moment over there. The skin tone-matching, pH-adaptive pink version is every bit as buildable, polished, and decadent feeling as the original black honey, and perfect for everyday makeup looks. The ""Almost Lipsticks"" are also well-known for working as a subtle lip *and* blush shade for a perfectly dewy, au naturelllll look!

I'm so excited to have more coming in the mail soon! I should be getting two arriving today and one on Monday. So far, I've bought this one, Yara, Haya & Rave Now, all three perfumes by the Arabic brand Lattafa. risala_perfumes_official Top Notes: Litchi, rhubarb, and tangerine. Middle Notes: Tropical fruits, peony, rose, and gourmand accord. Base Notes: Sandalwood, cashmeran, vanilla, and musk. First Impressions: The fragrance is a very girly & soft, fruity-floral sweet type of scent and the bottle is really pretty. It does project well, and I can easily smell myself with it on when I'm walking around outside in the sun. I've only worn it for a couple of hours, and it seemed to be holding up decently well. Update: After wearing for a few hours, it does fade away easily, so I recommend wearing it with a scented body lotion & body oil + Vaseline on pulse points to get it to last longer. It does, in fact, dry down to a more gourmand type of scent with the vanilla really shining through in the base. Also, it kind of smells like coconut with a really smooth velvety quality to it. So it might go great with some coconut scented body care products! (maybe vspink - Coco mist and lotion?) Honestly though, I was expecting a strawberry milkshake type of scent because of this one TikTok review that I watched where the girl said it smelled like that. Also, I didn't read the scent notes after to confirm if it had strawberry as an actual scent note or not, which is, of course, my own fault. I'd give it a 7/10 for the overall scent. I will be keeping it in my perfume collection and using it tonight for bed! #risalasensuelle #risala #sensuelle #perfume #perfumebottle #perfumecollection #perfumelovers #perfumeaddict #perfumeaddicted #perfumeaddiction #arabic #arabicperfume #arabicfragrance #fragrance #fragrances #fragrancelover #fragrancecommunity #perfumereview #fragrancereviews #pink #pinkperfume #pinkaesthetic #pinkfragrance #affordableperfumes #affordablefragrances #scentcombo"

I'm so excited to smell it since it has notes of both strawberries and champagne! Fingers crossed that it's good! The bottle is also so pretty with all the gold and the pink gemstone added to it. Also, the bottle itself is a velvety material, very fuzzy and soft. lataffaa Top Notes: Champagne, strawberry, tangerine, blood orange, and rose. Middle Notes: Gardenia, jasmine, and vanilla orchid. Base Notes: Amber, sandalwood, and chestnut. First Impressions: Immediately upon first spray to the skin, I smell the bright fruitiness, the bubbly champagne note, and definitely the rose! Then it dries down with the floral notes standing out a bit more. (The vanilla orchid in particular). So far, it seems to project really well, and the scent is gorgeous. I could smell myself with this on when running errands, and it stayed pretty well after several hours of wearing. I would personally like to combine this fragrance with victoriassecret - Strawberries and Champagne mist + lotion!

The bottle itself is obviously plastic, with a dome shaped cap that says 'RAVE' on it. I'm really excited to spray it and give my first impression of what this smells like! lataffaa Top Notes: Red fruits, orange. Middle Notes: Marshmallow, jasmine, and lily of the valley. Base Notes: Vanilla, musk, and moss. First Impressions: I really like the bottle, and it's a very pretty baby pink color. Upon first spray to bare skin, I definitely smell the red fruits and citrusy orange notes. When dried down, I can smell more of the marshmallow note, floral notes, and even the vanilla in the base. I really enjoy it! It's a very pretty, bright, and powdery fruity-floral gourmand scent. The more I smell it, I can detect the small amount of moss in the base. But not enough of a moss scent to ruin the sweetness for me! This fragrance also seems to project really well and has great staying power.

This is the most popular and most reviewed Lattafa fragrance on TikTok and YouTube. I will be giving my first impressions on this scent and what my nose picks up on the most. lattafa Top Notes: Orchid, heliotrope, and tangerine. Middle Notes: Gourmand accord, tropical fruits. Base Notes: Vanilla, musk, and sandalwood. First Impressions: Upon spraying this twice into the plastic cap, I immediately smell the floral notes and get a very powdery vibe from it as well. Then the vanilla and musk come out from the base. It's a very pretty scent but definitely not a ""Strawberry Milkshake-y"" scent like everyone is saying. Once again, I've been fooled by the reviews and didn't check the scent notes before buying to confirm if it actually had a strawberry note in it or not. I do still enjoy this fragrance, and it will be a part of my everyday fragrance rotation. I give it a 7/10 for the overall scent. The staying power and projecting power is decent. I'd give it 3-5 hours before having to re-apply! I would probably combine this fragrance with the new victoriassecret - Bare Vanilla Bliss mist and lotion! I will also say that this pairs well with Aquolina - Pink Sugar, as they both have that vanilla-y kind of sweetness! :) #lattafayara #lattafa #yara #perfume #perfumebottle #perfumecollection #perfumelovers #perfumeaddict #perfumeaddicted #perfumeaddiction #arabic #arabicperfume #arabicfragrance #fragrance #fragrances #fragrancelover #fragrancecommunity #perfumereview #fragrancereviews #pink #pinkperfume #pinkaesthetic #pinkfragrance #affordableperfumes #affordablefragrances #scentcombo"

n20bkck,2025-07-08 16:15:14,en,REDDIT,"  Ohhhhh, okay. Sorry about that. To me, fragrances don't have a gender, that's just marketing. But I did miss the part that you're a guy, I probably wouldn't have suggested Tea Rose - ha ha. Bath & Body Works does have men's fragrances and they are about $35. Although I don't know where you can smell them in person, the Lattafa line of fragrances is very affordable and has unisex and masculine fragrances. They are pretty long lasting and come in nice packaging. I got Khamra based on a recommendation from Reddit and was very happy - it's a gourmand sort of vanilla smell. Although I haven't smelled it, I imagine their Oud fragrances would read as masculine and they're only about $20 on Amazon right now."

The start is a bit tricky but smooth. Later it smells nice with jasmine and musk. You need a mature nose to get it fully, but for the price - no regrets! I'd give it 8/10 for smell and performance."
n2457jf,2025-07-09 03:54:39,en,REDDIT,"  Zara Supreme Vanilla, it opens with wood notes and then turns into a sweet vanilla. Bellavita Honey Oud, it's like a lighter version of Khamrah that can even be worn in the summer. It's less than $20 right now on Amazon. This would be my #1 choice if I could only have one spicy vanilla. Bath and Body Works Vanilla Romance smells great and the lotion will keep its scent all day. It layers gorgeously with any perfume that has a bit of spice. Rifaaqat and Lattafa Sehr are not to my liking. I bought both and they smell like gasoline. Rifaaqat turns into a cheap smelling musk after a few hours. Sehr has never made it that long before I had to wash it off. Lattafa Artisan Ethnique is spicy vanilla with a hint of rum. Nebras is an Ellish dupe. Paris Corner December Vanilla is a boozy vanilla patchouli bomb. I smelled it when I got it, and thought no way can I ever wear that, but it grew on me. It feels like being retro, tough and elegant all at the same time. Paris Corner Vanilla Mood is an interesting one. It doesn't smell like vanilla at first, more of a vaguely pleasant scent, then turns to a slightly leathery, sweet vanilla. Miim Miic 94 is a Kayali Vanilla 28 dupe. Miim Miic 108 and Khair Confection are Kayali vanilla candy rock sugar dupes. Both good, Confection is a bit better to me, plus the bottle is pretty."
n25586a,2025-07-09 09:00:42,en,REDDIT,"  Yeah. Paris Corner, which are the worst of the major clone brands by a lot, are ""discounted"" to still more expensive than much better fragrances from Lattafa, Maison Alhambra, Fragrance World, etc. tldr; Paris Corner are crap and Prime Day is a scam."

Muy conocidas ya, pero quiero destacar que hay una oferta de aniversario en el que las dos te salen casi al precio de uno. Por cierto, tened cuidado que hay muchas imitaciones de Lataffa, en aliexpresss por ejemplo. Son bonitas, en mí rendimiento medio (pero están abiertas hace 10 días, y es muy posible que aumente), creo que magnifica relación calidad precio. Son muy girly Yara queda en mi piel como una crema de dulces flores. Notas orquídea, heliotropo y naranja tangerina / Acuerdo goloso y frutas tropicales / vainilla, almizcle y sándalo Yara Candy encantadora, le siento el caralmelito. Notas: grosellas negras y Mandarina verde /Strawberry Fizz Candy y gardenia / vainilla, almizcle, ámbar y sándalo How lucky I am, my friend Betty let me enjoy them for 10 days🥰. They're already very popular, but I want to highlight that there's an anniversary sale where you can get them both for almost the price of one. By the way, be careful, there are many Lataffa imitations, on AliExpress, for example. They're beautiful; in my opinion, the average yield (but they've been open for 10 days, and it's very possible that it will increase), I think they're a great value. They're very girly Yara feels like a sweet floral cream on my skin. Notes: orchid, heliotrope, and tangerine / Gourmet accord and tropical fruits / vanilla, musk, and sandalwood Yara Candy is lovely, I can feel the caramel.

I've...went a bit crazy All prices and stores are Canadian. Anyway, from left to right: Gooey Butter Cake from The Good Scent. $14 at Winners. Smells divine and matches my Hempz Buttercream Vanilla Cake lotion and lip balm. Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth perfume and matching body spray cause I'm a likes to layer bitch. Walmart. Blind buy! Mugler Angel Eau de Toilette. Amazon Canada Prime deal. Very nice light scent. Also, blind buy! D&C Devotion. Saw one box at Winners, ran to Shoppers to test it, then prayed to the perfume gods and ran back to get it at Winners. Got it for a freakin' STEAL. Kayali Lovefest Burning Cherry. Blind buy (yeah, i know. I have a problem) but I'm soo glad I did! Love it. Hubby went nuts over it. Sephora. Scandal by JPG. I had tried a sampler of the Absolu and loved it but read the original had more honey notes. Went and tried it and loved it even more. Got 20 percent off at Shoppers today with the friends and family deal. Finally, Lattafa Yara Candy. Another blind buy (seriously, I need adult supervision) but I do like it. Like my other Lattafa--Eclaire and Angham--I'm going to let it sit a bit to do it's thing. So, that's it for me for awhile. Probably...maybe."

Preis vom 10.07.2025 04:13 Uhr Worauf du bei Sommerdüften achten solltest Sommerdüfte dürfen ruhig leichter und luftiger sein als ihre winterlichen Pendants. Ideal sind fruchtige, florale oder zitrische Noten, die nicht beschweren – wie bei dem Lattafa Orangen-Parfum. Besonders angenehm wirken Düfte mit frischer Kopfnote und weicher Basis, da sie sich bei Wärme sanft entfalten. Achte darauf, Eau de Toilettes oder leichte Eau de Parfums zu wählen, da sie oft dezenter sind und sich gut für den Alltag eignen. Wer empfindliche Haut hat oder Naturkosmetik bevorzugt, findet in veganen und alkoholfreien Alternativen eine schonende Lösung für den Sommer. Ein guter Sommerduft sollte nicht nur gut riechen, sondern auch ein Gefühl transportieren – Leichtigkeit, Wärme und Lebensfreude. Genau das gelingt mit den fruchtig-pudrigen und zitrischen Kompositionen von Lattafa Rave Now Pink. Ein perfekter Duft für herrliche Sommertage."

n2gniiq,2025-07-11 00:15:42,en,REDDIT,"  So I've been buying Middle Eastern  perfumes for over 2yrs. I've educated myself to read the notes on Fragranctica and read reviews also on Amazon ( good source too) Also  YouTube influencers. I've been very, very lucky on blind buys. I only disliked 3 out of 170 bottles. I feel thats a homerun. I just realized I truly love the note of Lychee Rose combo. So I have serveral fragrances with that blended in them but not the star notes. I've seen ""PARIS CORNER KHAIR FUSION"". I bought it. Supposedly dupe of Kayali Sparkling Lychee. And Lychee top note. I'm familiar of the maceration process. But this has to be the most screechy opening. Like sour rinds of citrus (grapefruit). That's not listed in this. It is fruity forward  but hoping this morphs into the fresh frizzy summer sweet Lychee scent . Anyone have this perfume and after your maceration are you happy with it. According to Fragranctica it seems like a 60/40 split on likability. 60 liking....hope it's not a fail for me and it turns into jueville fragrance. I feel the same as ""Lattafa Ansaam Gold"". It's a jueville gummy bear scent supposedly dupe for PDM ""Oriana"" High end perfume. Need some opinions on"""" Khair Fusion"". Thanks"

1lxo864,2025-07-12 01:31:08,en,REDDIT,"  I just received this Lattafa, it is a 10 out of 10 for me. Soft, fruity, slightly floral with a slight gourmand lean. Classy. Perfect for work so you don't  smell too loud for others, but great on a date as well. Just look at these notes: * **Top:** Raspberry, Italian Bergamot (Orange), Saffron * **Heart:** Amber, Bay Leaf, Geranium, Chamomile, Lavender, Cardamom, Caramel, Nutmeg * **Base:** Sandalwood, Cedarwood, Oakmoss, Resins, Vetiver, Oud, Vanilla, Musk Beautiful presentation if you save boxes and bottles. Got it on Amazon from VerSure, sold by Amazon, for $18.54."
n2pzbgs,2025-07-12 13:00:23,en,REDDIT,"  Yeah I only buy from the actual sellers on Amazon (lattafa, afnan, al haramain, etc) it's when you buy from the third party sellers is when it gets dicey."
n2qzlt2,2025-07-12 16:21:01,en,REDDIT,"  There are both scams and legitimate stores on Amazon so it's difficult to tell. There is a real Lattafa store on Amazon. But I don't believe it is called LattafaUSA, even in the US. It has an Amazon storefront that links to the actual Lattafa site. On the product page, the link to it should specifically say ""Visit the Lattafa Store."" (Are we allowed to link? If so, I'll just link but I didn't think it was!)"
n2r0ob2,2025-07-12 16:26:35,en,REDDIT,"  This is the one in your picture, and from here this links to the real storefront from the link that says ""Visit the Lattafa store."" I don't know if the one you saw that says USA is another one or not, but I know for sure this one is real! https://www.amazon.com/Lattafa-Parfum-Spray-Women-Ounce/dp/B0BTQ693W6?ref_=ast_sto_dp&th=1&psc=1"
n2rcs1h,2025-07-12 17:28:27,en,REDDIT,"  Lattafa has an Amazon storefront, so as long as the Seller says Lattafa, you should be good."

n2szhec,2025-07-12 22:45:44,en,REDDIT,"  I don't own Yara but what you got is the packaging I have definitely seen at Marshall's a few times. It always confuses me when I see it because I'm like, wait, I thought that was made by Lattafa... Because the box and label have that other brand on them, and the box itself doesn't have any authenticity indicators on it. Like someone else said, somebody might have bought it cheap at Amazon, Marshalls, etc. and returned it."
