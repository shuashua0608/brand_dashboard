Here are the ones I've tried: Nacific Uyu Cream Ampoule: underrated and so so hydrating. Love the texture Skin1004 Probio Cica Ampoule: nothing jaw dripping but a very solid option for hydration Manyo V Collagen Heartfit Ampoule: I love the texture and scent of this one. Very hydrating Dermafirm Soothing Repair Toning Serum: nice texture. Still skeptical about effectiveness of bakuchiol. Abib Jericho Rose Bifida serum: great hydrating option with bifida Mixsoon Soybean Milk Serum: Meh, was a little too gel like for my taste Numbuzin 9+: technically an essence but one of my holy grail products that I will forever repurchase Non-Korean: Byoma Hydrating Serum: very good hydration but I think there are better options Cocokind: another solid option for hydration Naturium Multi-Peptide serum: love this line in general. Excellent choice for peptides Agency peptide serum: only $9.99 on Amazon and another great peptide serum"

n0a9ei7,2025-06-28 18:50:24,en,REDDIT,"  Fidget toys/stim toys/picky pads/slime really help me. As far as skin care goes I've unfortunately mastered that. After I've picked at my face I wash my face with a gentle balm cleanser(I like the Byoma one) and then I use a milky toner(ITK brand on Amazon) with a few drops of panthenol(really good for skin barrier healing/protection) I also get mine on Amazon - just look for pure panthenol and find the one with the best reviews in your budget. You can't put pure panthenol directly on your face so you'll want to mix it in with your toner. Then I use The Ordinary Barrier Serum. Then I'll use a really great moisturizer(I recommend a Korean beauty brand - something that focuses on barrier health/repair again I love Byoma) I then put a layer of weleda skin food on. And then for days that are really really bad I put a thin layer of diaper rash cream(zinc oxide is also fantastic for skin barrier healing) on the areas I've picked(face, chest, arms) and sleep in that and wash it off with a gentle cleanser in the morning. And repeat everything except for the weleda and diaper rash cream. Good luck remember to have patience with yourself"

n134en7,2025-07-03 07:04:58,en,REDDIT,"  I would cut out the BYOMA toner and the beta glucan serum. You don't want anything getting in the way of the clindamycin and benzoyl peroxide, and if you're not familiar with the beta glucan serum already, you don't need something that could potentially break you out while you're adjusting to Tret. Keep your routine simple at the start. Washing twice a day might be too stripping, so consider a water-only cleanse in the morning. Also, Tret once a week, especially at .025%, is not enough for results. Start off every 3-4 nights and increase as tolerated."

My skin truly has never felt better. Now I can prioritize my skincare in less than 5 minutes, 2x a day at a price that doesn't break the bank as a gig working actor. It's a win win!

mov_8648266BC368754E5686EF1AB7827AF6,2025-07-09 06:00:00,en,WEB,"  Beauty that's worth buying As a beauty journalist, I've had the opportunity to try thousands of products over the years. From game-changing skincare innovation to viral makeup launches and pro-approved hair tools, my dressing table is a constantly revolving display of the latest and greatest in beauty. And yet, even with access to new products every day, I have curated a selection of staples I return to time and time again that deliver without fail. I used to have to traipse around sourcing them from various high street shops and ordering from different websites, but with Amazon's recent expansion into premium beauty, many of them are available online with next day delivery—and now, some of them are part of the latest Prime Day offerings. With so many deals flying around, so I wanted to share my absolute beauty must-buys to streamline your shopping list. From the self-tan mist that doesn't require any blending, to the multi-tasking hair hero I've been using for years, these are the products I trust and love enough to use on repeat. And yes, I will be buying multiples. Whether you want to stock up on products that you can be sure are worth your money, or are looking to test out something new (without the full-price commitment), these picks are where I'd suggest you start this Prime Day. The Best Prime Day Beauty Picks St.tropez Self Tan Purity Face Mist I have tried every face self tan, but return to this one every time. The ultra fine mist means that there's no blending required. None. And it's streak-free and flawless every time. Plus, it dries instantly and doesn't stain my pillow case. It's become a staple in my product roundup—I'm seldom without a bottle (or two!) . Shark Smoothstyle Heated Brush and Comb I love Shark for their powerful tools that make day-to-day styling easier, but I'm particularly a fan of their wet-to-dry hair styling solutions, including their SmoothStyle Brush and Comb. When on wet mode, it doesn't reach hair-damaging temperatures, and the can seamlessly be switched to dry mode to ensure lasting style. In other words it's time-saving, space-saving and hair-saving. Redken One United 25 Multi-Benefits Leave-In Conditioner and Treatment Spray This product may be the gold standard when it comes to multitasking. It delivers a whopping 25 hair benefits in one, from detangling and conditioning, to heat protection and frizz control. Plus, it will make your hair smell fresh from the salon. Elemis Pro-Collagen Marine Oil This is the perfect choice for anyone who says they don't 'do' facial oils. It's super lightweight and packed with marine actives including Padina Pavonica, Golden Seaweed and Roaring Water Kelp for instant skin plumping and lasting hydration. I love to use it for a lymphatic drainage massage along with a Gua Sha or facial roller. Sacheu Lip Liner Stay-N Peel Off Lip Stain I always think it's optimal to try a trending product at a discount in case it's not worth the hype—so if you haven't tried the viral Sacheu Lip Liner, now is your chance. Having said that, this product is worth the hype if you like long-lasting lip products in a range of colours, including Billie Eilish's favourite shade Noo-hed, although I tend to use it as an all-over tint rather than a liner (the applicator is quite wide and doesn't allow you to draw a fine lip line). St.tropez Self Tan Express Mousse While I love a leave-on self-tan mist for my face, I've never been able to master full body self-tans unless they have a guide colour, they dry instantly, and I can wash them off after a few hours. Enter express tanning mousses, i.e. the only self-tan format I can cope with where my body is concerned. This one has a guide colour to ensure zero streaks, and it develops in as little as one hour, after which time you can wash it off and basque in your golden glow. Byoma Milky Moisture Cleanser Milky skincare is having a moment—and for good reason. Originally from Korea (as so many great beauty innovations are), milky skincare includes formulas that are supremely lightweight, hydrating and gentle on the skin. Byoma's hero Miky Cleanser not only boasts all the aforementioned, but also a Tri Ceramide Complex (ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids) to dissolve daily build up including SPF, oil and makeup while ensuring skin feels soft – never stripped. It's a must-have for sensitive, redness-prone skin. CeraVe SA Smoothing Cleanser CeraVe has long been a beauty editor favourite when it comes to their range of cleansers, and their Salicyclic Acid cleanser is ideal for anyone who struggles with breakouts or congested pores. While the salicyclic acid exfoliates and regulates sebum, hyaluronic acid and ceramides support the skin barrier and boost moisture. Schwarzkopf Schwarzkopf Eyebrow Tint While I'm a natural brunette, my eyebrows missed the memo and have always been a very pale shade of mousey. I rely on at-home tints to save me having to draw my eyebrows on every morning, and to save me the hassle of going to a salon every week to have them dyed professionally. Of all the at-home tints, this one offers a rich colour and lasts the longest...."

mov_0328E3DD5BBFB5C4FA825D586C4AD822,2025-07-09 13:22:40,en,WEB,"  Sneaky, sneaky. Seven years ago, Charlotte Palermino, a skin-care expert, aesthetician and cofounder of Dieux, says she started working on the product side of beauty and was shocked to learn that things like “dusting” were industry practice. (And no, we're not talking about a dusting vs. a trim at the salon.) So what is dusting in skin care exactly? Here, the self-proclaimed “skincare fairy godmother” breaks it down for us. Why Do Skin-Care Brands 'Dust'? “Just because a brand claims an ingredient, does not mean it's at a level that actually works,” says Palermino. “It's a practice called 'dusting,' aka a sprinkling of a trending active ingredient so you think it's in there—but it's not, at an efficacious dose.” Palermino says sometimes “dusting” happens because brands just don't know. “At times, contract manufacturers do not share full formulas until certain production numbers are hit,” she explains. Another reason, she continues, is that brands think it's a stronger marketing story and the formula delivers as a whole. “This is more common—aka, you know the powerhouse isn't the highlighted ingredient. For example, a brand boasts ceramides, but it's the dimethicone doing all the heavy lifting.” How Much of an Ingredient Is Needed to Be Considered Efficacious? “Bigger isn't always better when it comes to skin-care ingredients,” Palermino says. “It doesn't always make sense to go outside the 'zone' of efficacy. A good example is niacinamide. Research shows that it's a powerhouse between 2 and 5 percent. For barrier repair, 2 percent, for hyperpigmentation, 4 to 5 percent. Large doses over that? Unclear.” Another example is lactic acid. “Under 1 percent, it's usually a pH adjuster; 1 to 3 percent, it's usually a humectant,” Palermino explains. “Pending the pH, 5 percent or more is when it's exfoliating. Lactic acid is water-soluble, so when there's no water in a formula—anhydrous—it's unclear how it works. Just because an ingredient is on the list, does not mean it's doing the thing it's known for. I love how BYOMA categorizes ingredients by what they do.” The 1 Percent Line on an Ingredient List You probably know that the ingredients included at the beginning of the list are the most potent, and that's a rule brands must follow. “The FDA requires brands to order your ingredient list in order of potency up to 1 percent. Anything under that, you can reorder, which is unusual for large corporations,” says Palermino, noting that every ingredient on Dieux labels is in order of potency. “There is a hydrating gel moisturizer we make called Air Angel. Anything under the blue [pictured below] is at or under 1 percent.” The skin-care guru also explains that one solution to dusting is when brands tell you the percentage of their hero ingredients included in a formula. For example, when a brand writes “10% glycerin” or 2% salicylic acid” and you know exactly what you're getting. However, Palermino explains that not all brands need to do this. “There are many reasons to omit percentages on products—one being that it's the formula, not a single ingredient that's the hero. Or, just list out the top one or two ingredients and share those percentages, which you see a lot with The Ordinary and The INKEY List.” The Bottom Line “You don't need complicated or cutting-edge ingredients to have an incredible product,” says Palermino. “Great skin care is available at all price points. What is less cool is claiming an expensive active, developing your marketing around the ingredient, and then sprinkling it in.” Related Posts"

Whenever a major sale like Amazon Prime Day rolls around, our team here at HuffPost Shopping has a few predictions of what will top our bestsellers list. Typically, we expect high-end tech products and HuffPost reader favorites like water flossers to do well, and we're usually right — but there are always a few surprises. This year, we used our data of the top-selling items we've covered for Prime Day to round up this list of surprise bestsellers. These run the gamut from beauty to tech, kitchen, cleaning and other categories, so keep scrolling to see what worthwhile deals you might've missed when Prime Day began that other shoppers have been flocking to. Prices change quickly on Prime Day, so keep checking back to see the latest updates. Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. A 4-in-1 charging cord (22% off list price) Chargers were in high demand this year, and this one was a favorite. Between phones, laptops, Bluetooth speakers, karaoke microphones and tiny digital cameras, there are just too many damn things to charge – and you may be constantly struggling to keep track of the variety of cords that go with each item. This 4-in-1 charging cord comes at the recommendation of HuffPost growth strategist Adam Schubak. “I got this from TikTok actually and I'm obsessed,” he wrote. “It's a great way to stay organized with all of your various gadgets since it has adapters for most devices you need to charge.” With USB-A, C, and lightning cable adapters, you can power up a multitude of gadgets with a charging speed that the brand describes as “impossibly fast.” Speedo unisex kids' swim goggles (48% off list price) Emily Ruane, HuffPost Shopping managing editor and mom of two, wrote about this pair of goggles from Speedo, which comes with an adjustable strap and are designed for children aged 3-8. ""After swim lessons last summer, I learned that goggles are a.) not at all a necessity and b.) a total novelty that makes them want to get into the pool. Go figure!"" she said. It seems other parents agree, since these were among the top 10 most-ordered products we saw on Days 1 and 2 of Prime Day. A fun book for the family (40% off list price) The summer edition of “Would You Rather?” is geared toward kids ages 8-12, and it encourages them to think about their preferences and how they'd respond to hypothetical situations. It's great for road trips — if only to avoid another round of, “Are We There Yet?” Best of all, it's less than $5 on Prime Day, a deal that many families appeared to jump on on Days 1 and 2. An absorbent and slip-resistant bath mat (34% off list price) An already affordable product (and surprise bestseller) just got an even better price. Gorilla Grip reports that their popular bath mat — which has 4.3 stars across more than 76,000 ratings — sold over 10,000 units in the past month alone, so with this discount, we're expecting shoppers to flock here. Made with cozy, plush chenille, the absorbent bath mat has a textured rubber backing and is slip- and fade-resistant. It comes in so many sizes and colors, so you can match your bathroom's style and needs easily. Palmer's Cocoa Butter formula lotion (36% off list price) You may have been focused on sales for popular K-beauty products, but those aren't the only skin care deals shoppers loved this year. Palmer's debuted its beloved cocoa butter formulas 175 years ago, making it one of the oldest skincare companies around. Today, customers still adore the brand's aromatic and hydrating moisturizers like this deliciously hydrating lotion. It's packed with vitamin E that soothes and softens rough skin. It rarely goes on sale, making this the perfect time to snag this skin care essential. Scrub Daddy and Scrub Mommy sponge set (20% off list price) The Scrub Daddy sponge is a magical household scrubbing tool that promises to be resistant to odors, unlike traditional sponges, and won't scratch surfaces while also being tough on messes. A viral innovation that first made waves when it appeared on Shark Tank, Scrub Daddy's unique texture and polymer foam material change from firm to soft based on water temperature, while the holes are great for cleaning smaller utensils. This discounted eight-pack also includes four Scrub Mommy sponges, which are a combination of the original scrubbing material and a foam material on the other side that generates suds. Clinique Almost Lipstick tinted lip balm (30% off list price) Beauty lovers know that this perfectly hued beauty product is the end-all be-all of lip balms, but we didn't expect it to be as popular as it has been so far. The balm is available in Black Honey and Pink Honey shades, though Black Honey is a cult-favorite lip color that is considered universally flattering and has been popular since the early aughts. This semi-glossy balm is perfect for everyday wear and rarely goes on sale. Amazon says this is 25% off, but based on the list price of $25, it's actually closer to 30% off. Even better! Mouthwatchers flossing toothbrushes two-pack (40% off list price)Normally, fancy electric toothbrushes are flying off the shelves on Prime Day. This year, however, they appeared to fall out of favor — instead, the only toothbrush that's made it near the top of our bestsellers list so far is this affordable option. These clever toothbrushes sport extra-thin ""flossing"" bristles to help clean deeper and more gently into grooves and gums. They're 10 times thinner than typical bristles making them more suitable for sensitive gums and teeth...."

1lz2arl,2025-07-13 20:01:20,en,REDDIT,"  # Ok so my current daily routine is: 1. good molecules foaming salicylic acid (BHA) cleanser 1. wet face, then work the foam into the face, rinse off 2. good molecules glycolic acid (AHA) toner (only do this occasionally when I feel like it) 1. dispense onto a cotton round and wipe onto skin 3. amazon basics benzol peroxide 10% cream 1. put a pea size amount on finger and rub on skin avoiding eye area 4. BYOMA moisturizing gel cream (ceramides, niacinamide, and green tea extract) 1. take a few pumps and rub into skin 5. Neutrogena mineral sunscreen stick (SPF) 1. spread a few passes over face and rub in # Why and how I am treating my skin: *  My skin is fair in completion, I have small bumps/pimples that sometimes form on my hairline and forehead, I have (now mild-moderate) cystic acne on my cheeks and jaw line, acne scars on my cheeks that are slightly textured and , and my t zone is a lil more red than the rest of my face (like mild rosacea). * I include: * salicylic acid (BHA) for its exfoliation, and acne treatment * benzol peroxide for acne treatment (good for cystic acne) * glycolic acid (AHA) for some exfoliation and to address acne scars/texture * gel moisturizer because it is not too thick on my skin, this is what feels best on my skin * ^ceramides to moisturize skin * ^niacinamide and green tea to soothe inflammation and treat redness * ^I like that the moisturizer I got includes the three of these together so I can simplify my routine and not drown my skin * mineral sunscreen **stick**- it feels way better on my skin and doesn't clog up my skin, absorbs nicely and washes off nicely at the end of the day, also doesn't run into or burn eyes at all with sweat!! my skin has definitely improved some. I have recently locked in my routine and am getting more consistent, so I am hoping to keep seeing more improvement # Where I would like advice and to learn more: * Other than not applying SPF I don't have a difference in my AM/PM routines.

1lz3ikm,2025-07-13 20:50:34,en,REDDIT,"  # Ok so my current daily routine is: 1. good molecules foaming salicylic acid (BHA) cleanser 1. wet face, then work the foam into the face, rinse off 2. good molecules glycolic acid (AHA) toner (only do this occasionally when I feel like it) 1. dispense onto a cotton round and wipe onto skin 3. amazon basics benzol peroxide 10% cream 1. put a pea size amount on finger and rub on skin avoiding eye area 4. BYOMA moisturizing gel cream (ceramides, niacinamide, and green tea extract) 1. take a few pumps and rub into skin 5. Neutrogena mineral sunscreen stick (SPF) 1. spread a few passes over face and rub in # Why and how I am treating my skin: * My skin is fair in completion, I have small bumps/pimples that sometimes form on my hairline and forehead, I have (now mild-moderate) cystic acne on my cheeks and jaw line, acne scars on my cheeks that are slightly textured and , and my t zone is a lil more red than the rest of my face (like mild rosacea). * I include: * salicylic acid (BHA) for its exfoliation, and acne treatment * benzol peroxide for acne treatment (good for cystic acne) * glycolic acid (AHA) for some exfoliation and to address acne scars/texture * gel moisturizer because it is not too thick on my skin, this is what feels best on my skin * ^ceramides to moisturize skin * ^niacinamide and green tea to soothe inflammation and treat redness * ^I like that the moisturizer I got includes the three of these together so I can simplify my routine and not drown my skin * mineral sunscreen **stick**- it feels way better on my skin and doesn't clog up my skin, absorbs nicely and washes off nicely at the end of the day, also doesn't run into or burn eyes at all with sweat!! my skin has definitely improved some. I have recently locked in my routine and am getting more consistent, so I am hoping to keep seeing more improvement # Where I would like advice and to learn more: * Other than not applying SPF I don't have a difference in my AM/PM routines.

1lzbk1n,2025-07-14 03:03:51,en,REDDIT,"  I think I ruined my moisture barrier around my eyes, especially on the left, from crying and wiping/dabbing my eyes with my sweatshirt sleeve, which wasn't the softest material. I've always had veiny undereyes and eyelids, and afterwards i noticed my eyes were purplish which I've never seen after crying (there's a photo on my profile). I figured i just broke some blood vessels and 2 days later those have healed by like 75%, but my eyelids and undereyes still sting so bad and feel raw. On the more irritated side i noticed my undereye veins are bulging which they never have before so i must have thinned the skin a lot. i also noticed a fine line i've never seen before on that side, it's only visible in certain light so maybe it was already there but i can't find it in any picture from the last 6 months. but ofc i wasn't angling to catch my fine lines in those pictures lol. I will be adjusting my routine starting tonight but my current routine is: AM: Beauty of Joseon Refreshing Green Plum Cleanser or La Roche Posay Hydrating Gentle Cleanser Peach Slices Snail Rescue Toner Pyunkang Yul Ultimate Calming Solution Ampoule Cocokind Revitalizing Eye Cream Azelaic Acid 15% Pyunkang Yul Blue Label Ato Cream Haruharu Wonder Black Rice Moisture Airyfit Daily Sunscreen SPF 50+ PM: Beauty of Joseon Refreshing Green Plum Cleanser or La Roche Posay Hydrating Gentle Cleanser Cocokind Revitalizing Eye Cream or my regular moisturizer around eyes Aquaphor or Cerave Healing Ointment around eyes Tazarotene .1% Pyunkang Yul Blue Label Ato Cream Slug with Aquaphor/Cerave sometimes the Pyunkang Yul cream and ampoule are new as of 2ish weeks ago, before i wasn't using an ampoule and for moisturizer i was using Soon Jung 2x Barrier Intensive Cream. I only switched bc the PKY was a bit cheaper and I haven't decided how I feel about it yet. I'm quitting both of these just because they're new and i'm not sure if they're exacerbating any irritation. I'm definitely quitting Tazarotene and Azelaic acid for now. Today I purchased Byoma Barrier Repair Eye Cream, La Roche Posay Cicaplast Balm, and Tower 28 SOS Barrier Recovery Cream. I'm debating whether to use Tower 28 or just Vanicream, but even though Vanicream doesn't irritate me it also doesn't sink in well so I wanted to try something else. When I was searching for products to help with barrier repair around the eye I saw the Byoma eye cream recommended on a few different reddit posts, but I'm a little scared to try it lol. I've never used the LRP cicaplast because i've never had barrier issues before, but I trust everyone else that it's a godsend lol. So I'm thinking my new routine will be: AM: Wash with water only Maybe keep the Peach Slices snail toner? My skin likes it but it is newer in my routine, I bought it as a quick replacement for Cosrx Byoma Barrier Repair Eye Cream Tower 28 SOS Cream or Vanicream Cicaplast over eyes (I don't wear makeup and don't care about the white cast rn lol) Haruharu Sunscreen, probably avoiding the eyes for now and just wearing sunglasses outside because I think it stung me a bit today PM: La Roche Posay Hydrating Gentle Cleanser Peach Slices Snail Toner (maybe) Byoma Eye Cream Tower 28 SOS Cream or Vanicream LRP Cicaplast over eye area Slug maybe? Please help, I wish I made this post earlier when I was researching/shopping because I have to wash my face for bed soon and don't know exactly what I'm gonna do"
