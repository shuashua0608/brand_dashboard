Yeah I was thinking of using my irrigation floss with the green tea solution. . it's a generic one from Amazon... they were saying that won't go as deep as 9mm tho. Is Waterpik or something better?

Contrary to what you see on social media and in TV shows and movies, sometimes it's the simplest and cheapest habits that end up really improving your quality of life. Recently, frugal people on Reddit shared the cheapest habit that changed their lives for the better, and it was a goldmine of good ideas. Here's what they had to say: 1. ""Cleaning frequently but half assed adds up to pretty clean over time. Quick wipe of the stove and counters, clean a few dishes, walk away. Do this once or twice per day, and it adds up to a pretty clean kitchen. Then, if you want an even shinier kitchen, you're already most of the way there."" ‚ÄîJustPandering ""I play a game with myself to see how much kitchen cleaning I can do in the two minutes it takes to heat my water up in the microwave for coffee. I usually can empty the dishwasher in about two minutes!"" ‚ÄîRonscat 2. ""Buy multiples of a clothing item that fits me. I stopped caring if people noticed it's the same cut or style. Guys can wear the same thing over and over again and no one really bats an eye. So if I find pants that fit. I'm buying five. A shirt that fits well. I'm buying multiples of that color or other colors."" ‚ÄîGlassfern ""I make my own clothing, and yes, I will make a dress six times in different fabrics because I love it."" ‚ÄîOwn-Tea-4836 3. ""Read the instructions/manual for your new items! The instructions on new electronics, kitchen gadgets, etc., outline exactly how to care for the item and how to troubleshoot issues. It takes like 5-10 minutes and definitely ensures longevity on most items."" ‚ÄîQuestFarrier ""We have a Google Drive folder. As soon as something new comes into the house, I Google it and find the PDF of the manual and save it to that folder. We always have the manual to troubleshoot. And I don't need to find a place to keep the papers."" ‚ÄîWhimsical_Adventurer 4. ""Floss. There are a bunch of different products that can be more expensive, but once you're addicted to it, you can't go back. You will notice if you skip days. I started with just the roll kind, but now use a toothbrush-looking kind. Never tried the Waterpik kind, but curious if it's any good."" ‚Äîelvis8mybaby ""I cannot even fathom sleeping without gliding floss between my teeth, or I feel extreeeemely uncomfortable lol."" ‚Äîpetrastales 5. ""Practicing gratitude. My misery was in defaulting to a 'victim' mindset, and things I don't have. It paralyzed me. By focusing on the things I am capable of doing, and the things I do have, I was able to dig myself out of that hole."" ""I won't suggest it's a mindset that works for everyone, because you really have to dig deep sometimes to focus on something to be happy about. So in that sense, it can feel unrealistic...."

We first looked at Amazon's daily deals page, which is typically labeled ‚ÄúToday's Deals‚Äù on Amazon's toolbar if you're viewing on a desktop or laptop computer. Then, we used two third-party tools, CamelCamelCamel and Keepa, to look at the price history associated with an item we've chosen to see whether or not its current price was at or matching the lowest price seen so far this year. Now some products may not be seeing their lowest price of the year right now, but they could either as we get closer to or during Prime Day. We'll be sure to try to keep you updated as best we can, but feel free to use those tools as you look to score the best deal possible for you.

The pressure is good. Compared with Waterpik battery models, this is a better made product. Also compared to the Quip flosser, this is better because the water tank is fully removable, and you can clean it thoroughly. You can disassemble this flosser so it can dry completely which helps against bacteria or mold forming on its surfaces. The quip water tank is not removable and there is gunk/microbes forming in the crevaces over time. Some Waterpik water tanks are L shaped which also make some areas unreachable for cleaning. This is a superior design. The water intake tube is also weighted so it can draw water from the corners when tilted.

mz2qxdd,2025-06-22 00:41:54,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ To preface, I am a dental hygienist: You said you started to notice the spacing‚Ä¶ when did you start to notice it? It hasn't always been present? In any event, diastemas (gaps in between teeth) and open contacts are notorious food traps that are harder to keep clean. This can end up eventually affecting the gums substantially in these areas. If finances are a concern at all, I HIGHLY recommend going to a dental hygiene school for this cleaning. I can see subgingival buildup (the tartar/calculus with a dark brown/black tinge to it) around the lower front teeth along with some puffiness of the gums caused by the associated inflammation. This will 100% require a deep cleaning to address. Their ballpark cost at most dentists' offices is $1-2K+ usually before insurance ($300-800ish after for most people‚Ä¶ some can cover more but it's usually around this range). The hygiene program I went to: $30 - every cleaning, every time (or sometimes we wouldn't charge at all depending on circumstance). You'll pay with your time instead of your money - they're long appointments and it will likely take a few to do your whole mouth. If you can take the time out to do it, you'll save a fortune. Things you can do to halt disease progression (overall): 1) deep cleaning (this is a must) 2) great home care 3) hygiene appointments at an interval of every 3 months 4) I'd look into ortho to fix the spacing issues and create contacts between those lower front teeth. That's already the #1 buildup hotspot, so having teeth that are misaligned in any way in this area (both with overlapping or diastemas) is likely to cause gingivitis/perio issues unless you're super diligent and effective with your plaque control. (You may also be able to do ortho at a dental college that trains orthodontists for a cheaper price there too, but idk for sure. Schools that train dental professionals are usually the most affordable route available tho). In the meantime and moving forward: 1) try not to worry too much before the appointment. Perio can't be reversed, but it can be arrested. 2) Keep with your 2x daily toothbrushing. If you don't have an electric, I recommend getting one. (Sonicare is the best imo and I'll die on that hill). 3) Try an expanding floss. The floss fibers spread out and grab more plaque than any waxed floss ever will. I personally recommend Cocofloss (not found in stores, but can be ordered from [here](https://cocolab.com/collections/cocofloss) or their Amazon storefront). It has coconut oil woven into it which can help soothe the gums. Also, coconut oil is an excellent, natural antimicrobial! They're a super eco-friendly company also. 4) try some proxabrushes to help clean between the front teeth. (For these I'd go G.U.M brand only - I've used the generic ones and they don't seem to hold up as well). 5) a 1/2 teaspoon of bleach can be added to a Waterpik tank (countertop models, I wouldn't use it in a cordless) and you can use the Pik Pocket tip at the lowest setting to irrigate your gums at home. Obviously don't swallow it - rinse your mouth out with water after. Then flush regular water through the Waterpik after use. This helps to kill periodontal bacteria and keep their levels below the gums down a bit while keeping the gum pockets flushed out. In the meantime all you can really do is keep plaque levels down. Sorry that this is so long. Lots of love and luck with this moving forward! ‚ù§Ô∏è you can keep me posted if you like or DM me with questions if you have any. Edit: I tried to fix the spacing but it didn't work."

If I don't need the tea and I want to get ready for bed, I floss, waterpik, mouthwash, brush my teeth, wash my face, do my skincare routine, pee one last time, switch into pjs (if I'm not ready in them), FaceTime my boyfriend for 5-10 minutes to say goodnight, either scroll on Reddit or IG, then finally put my phone down, put on my eye mask, have Google turn off my bedroom light, and then turn my audiobook on for a 15 minute timer and fall asleep listening to it. All in, from the time I decide to get ready for bed and going to sleep, it's about anywhere between 1-2 hours. Depends on how tired I am that day."

Amazon Prime Day is coming! From July 8th through July 11th, we'll be wading through the mountains of bargains for you to find some of the best deals in every category. For *now*, we're finding the best pre-Prime Day deals and reminding you to sign up for a¬†Prime membership¬†so you can take advantage of the sale! 1. 62% off the latest model of Blink outdoor security cameras (the cheapest they ever go for, and the first time they've been this price in 2025) offering 1080p HD day and infrared night footage so you can watch over your property right from your phone. The kit is easy to install (even if you're not tech savvy), you can save and send video, and there's two-way talk so you can scream at the squirrels stealing your bird food. Squirrels need to eat, too, but I get it. These wire-free security cameras come with two-year batteries and a free 30-day Blink trial. The subscription is not necessary, but it offers extra features like video storage and person detection. Promising review: ""I've never owned a home camera before so I asked around and did my research‚Ä¶The app alone is AMAZING! The quality of the video is great and you can adjust it how you want as far as motion detection. The night vision...WILD! And the fact that I can talk to my dog and hear him if he barks‚Ä¶I would definitely recommend both indoor and outdoor cameras. THEY ARE AMAZING!!!"" ‚ÄîJomyra Malave Price:¬†$99.99 (originally $259.99) 2. 50% off the *newest* Amazon 4K Fire TV Stick ‚Äî that's the best price outside of Cyber Week. It has 4K picture, Dolby sound, and ~WiFi 6~ to help with uninterrupted streaming, plus smart search so you can find a movie or TV show by actor, genre (""action movies with car chases""), or even quote! Just plug into your existing TV and stream all the shows, movies, and music you want at the push of a button. Promising review:¬†""I've been dealing with WebOS on my LG TV for three years now, and enough is enough. Fire TV stick is  I love this thing. I can even view my Blink cameras on the big screen now; so cool. Setup is so easy and it linked to my other Alexa-enabled devices just great. Picture is great, response is lightning quick."" ‚ÄîMattSR Price:¬†$24.99 (originally $49.99) ‚Äî and shop all of the¬†Amazon device deals here. 3. Up to $105 off a portable Black & Decker air conditioner (that also works as a dehumidifier and fan) with all the power and cooling you need, without any permanent changes ‚Äî you can even move it easily from room to room as needed. And reviewers note it's much cheaper than running central air! It comes with a window kit for easy installation, too! Promising review:¬†""Incredible portable AC unit. This unit is a hoss. It is the only one we have gotten that cools our bedroom in under 30 minutes. We have tried at least three other units that were too weak, t,o loud, or failed after a few weeks. Stop looking around and get this one."" ‚ÄîAndrew Promising review:¬†""I love to sleep in a freezing¬†cold¬†room, but I hate the power bill that goes along with cooling an entire house. This unit was the best solution. It keeps the room frigid, and I sleep like a rock. It barely increases my bill and really improves my sleep."" ‚ÄîMat Price:¬†$224.99+¬†(originally $329.99+; available in 8,000, 8,500, 10,000, 12,000, and 14,000 BTU versions, plus a version that also functions as a heater). 4. Up to 42% off a set of lightweight packing cubes to help you fit *more* in whatever back or backpack you're trying to squeeze everything into. The individual cubes mean you do *not* have to sit on your carry-on roller to get it closed. And you can even organize them by day, clothing type, ~segment of your trip~ (like city/beach/weather), etc. And they're mesh so you can easily see what's inside!..."

At least, the early July 4th sales I'm seeing at Amazon on this lovely Tuesday sure feel like presents. I've been a professional deals hunter for years now, and, if I'm being honest, I'm not usually impressed by markdowns leading up to Prime Day (which kicks off on July 8, FYI). But I've spotted some rare gems, and even a few record-low prices to scoop up before next week's markdown madness ensues. If a new hand vacuum is in order, this heavy-duty Craftsman (which I swear by) is on sale for its best price ever at $59 (down from $100). Did last week's ""heat dome"" catch you unprepared? ""One if by air, two if by water"" are the bywords for this indoor/outdoor Shark misting fan. Liberate yourself from seasonal swelter while saving a very cool 50 bucks (also an all-time low). Summertime means your face needs extra-special care. Alas, not all eye creams are created equal, so make sure you score a tube of this line-minimizing option from ROC ‚Äî it's nearly 35% off (and comes recommended by our beauty editor). All that, plus deals on Apple, Waterpik, KitchenAid, Hanes and s'more. (You be eating some of those this weekend, right?) Best Amazon July 4th deals: Rare sales Amazon Apple products are so sought after that they don't really need to go on sale, and when they do, it's often because they're older models. This is the latest version of this iPad, which makes the markdown all the more impressive. According to Yahoo Senior Deals Writer Chris McGraw, who specializes in all things tech, ""It's an ultra-light, thin tablet that's powerful enough to replace your laptop for most tasks but slips into your bag without a second thought. With a large 11-inch Liquid Retina display, you're swiping and scrolling in vibrant color and sharpness that makes any screen that came before feel like an old tube TV. ""If you've got a habit of toggling between a dozen apps, streaming videos and replying to messages at once, you're in for a treat. This iPad is ready to keep up with whatever you throw its way. And if you're into gaming, the graphics capabilities mean you can play even demanding games without dropping a frame."" $299 at Amazon Amazon Don't want a new vac to suck a ton of cash from your wallet? This sleek stick's a rare $74 (it's only dipped lower than this once). It boasts strong suction for zapping up everything from dust to pet hair, and provides up to 40 minutes of run time per charge. Plus, its LED lights help you see those darker spaces, and its cyclonic filtration system traps airborne particles as well. Related: The best cordless stick vacuums for 2025, tested and reviewed $74 at Amazon Amazon If the thought of making ice cream at home is intimidating to you, these have your name on them. Really, they couldn't be easier to use ‚Äî just make sure your mugs are frozen for at least 24 hours, then mix up your ice cream base (there's a recipe book included). Once your mugs are sufficiently chilled (you want them to be cold), you'll add your base, turn 'em on and they'll start churning away. You can also add mix-ins of your choosing via the pour chutes while they're running, and in about 20 minutes, you'll have ice cream. Simple, right? This duo rarely dips lower than this, so scoop 'em up for their lowest price in over a year. Save $12¬†with Prime $28 at Amazon Amazon If a smaller screen suits your needs, you won't do much better than this highly affordable No. 1 bestseller. It's equipped with Alexa voice control and is compatible with Apple AirPlay, meaning you can pair it with your Apple device to broadcast photos and videos on the screen. Plus, at a mere $70, it's down to its best price of 2025 ‚Äî and my price trackers tell me it's never been on sale for less. Save $60¬†| Lowest price ever $70 at Amazon Amazon The best meals are the ones you can make by tossing all of the ingredients into one cooking vessel, then setting and forgetting. That's probably why these appliances are such fan favorites ‚Äî and this model, with its nine functions in one, is so versatile, it just might become the most-used thing in your kitchen. Make rice, sear chicken ... or heck, even whip up some yogurt in it. You'll be able to cook enough food to feed six people, so I'll be awaiting my dinner party invitation. Oh, and this 50% discount brings the price down to its lowest of 2025 ‚Äî for comparison, a 3-quart version is only $10 less......"

Amazon Prime Day 2025 is just around the corner, happening July 8-11. The massive sale event is always a great time to pull the trigger on some fancy new tech, clothing, or other long-wishlisted items, but here's a secret: The best way to shop Prime Day is to buy the boring stuff that you'd buy anyway. During Prime Day, Amazon discounts thousands of everyday essentials. Sure, we might ‚Äúneed‚Äù AirPods, but we need things like toilet paper, toothpaste, paper towels, and cleaning supplies. During Prime Day, you can bulk-buy these essentials while they're heavily discounted and actually save hundreds, if not thousands over the next few months. It's not glamorous, but it's the best way to save during Prime Day. Even better news? Amazon is kicking things off early with some of the best early Prime Day essentials deals already live ahead of the event next week. The Best Early Prime Day Essentials Deals Looking to save on basics ahead of Prime Day? Read on. Ahead is our selection of the best early Prime Day essentials deals. We focused on discounted bulk items that just about everyone can use, from shampoo to coffee filters. Some of the discounts don't seem like a lot (maybe 15%), but that adds up.

Our philosophy when it comes to major shopping events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon Prime Day is to first consider what you need and make a list. If you don't have a plan, you could end up buying things you really don't need. Think about what you regularly shop for: snacks for the kids, batteries, cleaning supplies, etc. Then look around your house and see if you need bigger items like kitchen appliances or a new vacuum cleaner. Do the kids need anything? Outdoor toys, sports equipment, crafting kits, clothes, and back-to-school supplies come to mind. Maybe you have a wedding shower or birthday party that you need gifts for‚Äîthis is a good time to score what they want at a savings.

n1aeghv,2025-07-04 11:20:16,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ I love my water flosser! I recommend them all the time (with a couple of caveats) to patients, especially those who can't or won't floss with traditional string. So are you supposed to use string floss along with water flossing? Technically, yes. HOWEVER... the ADA (American Dental Association) says that water flossing is an acceptable substitution for those who can't or won't. Here's how to ensure you're getting an excellent clean: 1. Use a water flosser that carries the ADA seal. Currently only two brands do:  WaterPik and Phillips Sonicare. I've used a couple of the cheap ones available on Amazon and I'm not impressed, mostly because the pressure is inadequate. 2. Frequency of use. Gotta do this daily. 3. Adequate pressure. If you have a counter-top model that goes to 10, you're going to want to work up to around level 7, give or take. Cordless flosser that has 3 levels, try to get to 3 (they aren't as strong as the counter model)  **CHECK WITH YOUR HYGIENIST**  if you have unhealthy tissue, (or gingival treatments like LANAP) you need to stabilize before you can use higher pressure. 3a. Work up to pressure. Start on a low setting and turn it up until it is uncomfortable. Back off a level and there's your starting place. Every week or two increase the pressure and see if it's tolerable. 3b. Don't aim the stream into the pocket; aim it 90 degrees to the tooth at the gum margin. The water will flush down into the pocket just fine. 3c. Use proper technique - check out the mfr website for videos. You want to make little ""m"" shapes on the top arch and little ""w"" shapes on the bottom arch, following the gumline and praising for a second or two between each tooth. Throw some string floss in there a few times a week and you'll be in great shape! I personally do both daily (super passionate about oral care!) but even a few times a week paired with water flossing is excellent. I'll probably get downvoted for this take by other dental professionals because for a long time, it was drilled into everyone that water flossing is not a replacement. But tech advances and clinical studies are showing that it is really darn good! I follow the studies about it pretty closely, and, anecdotally, the patients that I have convinced to try it have massively improved home care. Like night and day difference with plaque control, less bleeding, healthier tissue overall, etc. I could go on! I hope this helps, and if anything you may have learned never to engage a tooth nerd on their favorite subject"

However, effective cleaning ‚Äì tooth brushing twice a day, with the removable of debris from interproximal spaces ‚Äì isn't easy for some patients. Dexterity is something that many people may take for granted, but for those that cannot clean their dentition with ease, their clinician is a primary source of support. Dental professionals need to be aware of prominent dexterity issues, and how they may affect a wide array of patients. They should also understand the aspects of an oral hygiene routine that can be most difficult, and identify opportunities to use alternative oral hygiene adjuncts. Making a connection Hand dexterity is the ability to perform small, precise hand movements with flow and accuracy. [i] Some studies differentiate manual ability and manual dexterity, with the latter describing the proficiency of the skill to perform a manual task depending on factors such as cognition. [ii] Complications may be seen throughout the entirety of an oral hygiene routine. Take the use of traditional dental floss as an example. A patient needs to take floss from a dispenser, which uses unilateral or bilateral gross motor movement of the shoulder, elbow, forearm, wrist, and fingers; then onto the action of flossing itself, they require fine motor control with manual dexterity of the arms, hands and fingers once more. [iii] Studies have shown that manual dexterity is linked to the effectiveness of dental flossing,iii and some that focus on patients in residential homes have found that manual dexterity can be connected to the amount of dental plaque present.ii Where more plaque is present, patients are more likely to develop periodontal infections, which can be severely damaging in the long term. Patients affected Causes for limited dexterity vary, but one of the most well-known connections is age. This, alongside grip strength, is a significant predictor of hand dexterity. [iv] Maintaining oral health into old age is paramount, as tooth loss can be severely detrimental to general health. Edentulism, which may come from periodontal disease, impacts mastication and makes bolus formation difficult, which creates dysfunctional swallowing. This may lead to a change in diet, and an avoidance of harder foods such as meat, fruits or vegetables, which can lead to malnutrition. [v] The effects of malnutrition include an increase in severity of oral infections.v Rheumatoid arthritis is another potential cause for concern. It is the most common inflammatory arthritis and affects around 1% of the UK population,[vi] with women under 50 around four to five times more likely to be affected by men ‚Äì though this disparity diminishes with age. [vii] As well as changes to systemic immune function, rheumatoid arthritis can cause physical impairment, most frequently affecting the wrist, proximal interphalangeal joint (middle of each finger) and the metacarpophalangeal joints (knuckles). vii This complicates oral hygiene routines, especially those that utilise traditional dental floss. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis are found to have a greater risk of periodontal disease.vii Other causes for limited dexterity may include cerebral palsy, muscular dystrophy, multiple sclerosis and stroke. [viii] These may appear in a patient's medical history, or the individual could volunteer the information during an appointment. Engaging in a discussion around the difficulties faced when performing an oral hygiene routine can then help clinicians recommend the right alternatives for a patient's needs. Recommending alternatives Powered toothbrushes have been recommended in the literature for individuals with decreased manual dexterity, owing to an improved action and control over tooth cleaning. [ix] By implementing this solution, the research even states that any individual can use good brushing technique, and experience greater plaque removal and improvement to gingival health, irrespective of manual dexterity. Water flossers have also been recommended for patients lacking manual dexterity[x] as an alternative to traditional flossing, and should still be used alongside tooth brushing. Patients can disrupt plaque and debris with jets of water, using the different pressure options typically available, and they are also able to target bacteria beneath the gingival margin. Patients should be sure to choose high-quality and clinically proven adjuncts above all else. Clinicians can recommend those from Waterpik‚Ñ¢, the only water flosser brand to be approved by the Oral Health foundation. With an easy-to-use oral hygiene solution in the Waterpik‚Ñ¢ Cordless Advanced water flosser, patients can remove up to 99.9% of plaque from treated areas in just three seconds. [xi] Plus, it is clinically proven to be up to 50% more effective than traditional dental floss for improving gum help. [xii] Dexterity may make oral hygiene routines challenging, but not impossible. Clinicians can provide support to patients in appointments, as well as through appropriate recommendations for oral hygiene solutions. This helps more patients maintain their dentition, for more healthy, bright smiles. For more information on WaterpikTM¬†water flosser products visit¬†www.waterpik.co.uk.

Amazon Prime Day is here, and while the retailer is touting deals on electronics, bedding, luxury apparel and housewares, many shoppers are using the four-day event (July 8-11) to stock up on everyday household essentials, as fears of tariff hikes, rising prices and unemployment continue to linger. Some of the bestselling Prime Day products from 2024 already included things like Energizer batteries, Glad trash bags, Crest WhiteStrips and Liquid I.V. packs, showing that customer intent was less about a wishlist, and more about immediate needs. Data from consumer insights company Numerator revealed a similar trend, with skincare essentials, office supplies, and vitamins and supplements among the top categories that saw year over year growth from Prime Day 2023. Half of shoppers surveyed say they specifically waited for items to go on sale during Prime Day before adding to cart, while almost 30% say they stocked up on must-have products in bulk during the Prime Day dates. This year's Prime Day deals seem to reflect that sentiment, with up to 30% off everyday supplies and household essentials from Amazon Basics (starting at $3); up to 30% off¬†pet food and¬†supplies; and up to 35% off lawn and garden items, among others. Amazon Prime members can also take $20 off their grocery bill when they spent $75 or more online at Amazon Fresh or at Whole Foods Market. In addition, Prime members get three months of free access to Amazon's grocery subscription service, which offers unlimited free delivery on orders from Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and local grocery retailers on Amazon.com. While Amazon is promoting discounts of up to 65% off site-wide, the feeling seems to be that ‚Äúevery little bit counts‚Äù when it comes to cost savings this year. Even getting a couple dollars off daily essentials like toilet paper and laundry detergent could be enough reason to stock up and save. Here's a look at some of the bestselling essentials to buy during Prime Day. Note: you'll have to be an Amazon Prime member to see the biggest discounts (and final price), so make sure you're logged into Amazon with your membership details before you shop. Not a Prime member? Get a 30-day free trial here to shop Prime Day with no commitments.

However, if you can't wait until then, you're in luck. Some of the best early Amazon Prime Day deals can score you major savings right now. Prime Day carries some of the best sales we see each year outside Black Friday and Cyber Monday, making it a great shopping event for those who don't want to wait another four to five months for notable discounts. This year's July event will last for a whopping four days, from July 8-11, which is twice as long as previous years. The sale is exclusive to people with Amazon Prime memberships, but those who have never had a Prime subscription before can get it on the action with a 30-day free trial (and those who have subscribed to Amazon before can also restart their paid memberships). We've scoured Amazon and compared several of the live deals to past sales to identify some of the best offers currently available ahead of Prime Day. Some available deals are all-time low prices, and others are simply good deals on our favorite brands and products, like Apple, Nespresso, Dyson, and more. Keep reading to see all the available deals, including five can't-miss discounts. You're also welcome to peruse the Amazon Prime deals page at your own leisure. As a team, we at Business Insider Reviews have spent years covering Prime Day and other shopping holidays, so we know a good deal when we see one. This means that we can also tell when a deal has previously been much lower and might not be worth shopping this time around. Below, you can find five of our absolute favorite deals that are live right now. The Nespresso VertuoPlus and Milk Frother bundle is the cheapest we've ever seen it, only previously marked this low during Black Friday. The Samsung 65-inch The Frame TV is also a great deal, discounted even more than it was for the 4th of July. Your perfect latte is only two steps away with the Nespresso VertuoPlus and Milk Frother. Upgrade your coffee set-up with this bundle at the best price we've seen all year. The AirPods Pro 2 are a big upgrade from their predecessors, with improved noise cancellation and battery life. They also support new aural health features to assess your hearing and function as hearing aids. This model comes with a USB-C charging case and added dust resistance. Samsung's Frame TV can be mounted flush against your wall like a hanging piece of art. It also features a matte screen to make it look more like canvas, and you can purchase optional magnetic frame bezels in different colors and designs. For a Dyson at the lowest price possible, you can't go wrong with the basic but mighty Dyson V8 Plus Cordless Vacuum. It offers two cleaning modes, three attachments, and a cleaning time of up to 40 minutes. The newest MacBook Air is powered by an M4 chip for ultimate speed and efficiency. The 13-inch, 16 GB laptop comes in traditional silver and three other sky-inspired colors. Amazon's best 4K panel stretches out to 75 inches. Omni QLED promises a brighter picture with better colors and contrast. The Omni Mini LED is Amazon's flagship smart TV model. It uses a Mini LED backlight to provide a bright, high-contrast image. The display also has a fast 144Hz refresh rate for smoother gaming performance. The Samsung Galaxy Z Flip 6 offers a lot of the same features as its predecessors, plus improved durability, better battery life, and better cameras. The new Amazon Echo Spot features a brand-new display face and functions best as an alarm clock smart speaker. It offers rich sound and can control your smart home's other devices with the help of Alexa. Like its predecessor, the Link 2 delivers high-quality 4K video. Its large half-inch sensor captures more light, resulting in better quality in low light. Its camera sits on a gimbal, allowing it to track and automatically pan and tilt to keep the user in the center of the screen. Besides a new design, the Link 2 has improved noise cancellation and a lower price. The Jackery Explorer 300 Portable Power Station can power or charge six small devices at a time and recharges using a solar panel (not included), wall outlet, or car port. Right now, it's at an all-time low price when hitting the coupon box at Amazon.

The Breville the Barista Express is the best all-in-one, semi-automatic espresso machine you can find. Though newer, more expensive models have been released, this one is still our favorite. It's a pressure cooker, slow cooker, rice and grain cooker, steamer, saute, sous vide, yogurt maker, sterilizer, and warmer all-in-one. The 28 program settings are great for making a bunch of different meals, but there are also five programmable settings for your own special recipes. The 6-quart capacity cooks up to six portions , and it has over 11 different safety features. From one of our favorite air purifier brands, the Levoit Core 300 is a solid investment for keeping your air clean without breaking the bank...."

Though Amazon's sale kick off July 8, we have our sights set on the deals coming out from Amazon's biggest competitor ‚Äî Walmart. The Walmart Deals event ‚Äî Walmart's alternative to Prime Day ‚Äî runs from Tuesday, July 8 to to Sunday, July 13, lasting an entire two days longer than Amazon Prime Day (which ends on Thursday the 11th). The sales event includes markdowns on big-name brands and top-rated products at low prices we don't expect to see again until November. Quick OverviewSee 45 more As AOL's resident shopping experts, we spend our days doing lots (and lots) of digital window shopping, checking prices and testing products to make sure we recommend only the very best products and deals on them to you, dear reader. That means we know whether or not a price drop of $50 on 40-inch smart TV is actually good or not, or if $154 really is the lowest price we've seen on a small chest freezer. (Spoiler: The answer is yes in both of those situations!) . As someone who's been covering Amazon Prime Day and all of its competition for about eight years now, I'd say I'm a bit of an expert at knowing what's a good deal and what's a dud. In fact, it's not uncommon to see prices of non-name brand items go around Prime Day at many retailers as third-party sellers try to capitalize on added site traffic during the sales event. That's why it's more important than ever for experts like us to comb through the deals and highlight the ones that we know are actually worth your money. With that, we'll get into some of the best deals we're seeing from Walmart's Prime Day sale, including $87 for our tech editor's favorite smart mug, $20 for a Sam's Club annual membership and a Frigidaire ice maker for the lowest price we've ever seen. If you own a less-than-ideal TV, this is a budget-friendly upgrade for the garage, a bedroom or the kids' video games ‚Äî at just $118, it's a real steal. It has 1080p resolution, and the Roku platform is baked right into the hardware. You can navigate through your most-loved streaming apps with just a few buttons. Another perk: You can pair it with Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa. $118 at Walmart The ultimate smart travel toothbrush, this Sensonic brush from Waterpik includes all the features you know and love from the brand: a long-lasting battery that runs for a month on a single charge, a 2-minute timer with 30-second pacers, three brushing modes, ADA-compliant soft bristles and a soft-grip handle. ""The soft bristles are gentle on gums, and the long battery life is a bonus,"" wrote a recent shopper. ""Highly recommend it for a professional-level clean at home!"" $55 at Walmart FRIGIDAIRE We love a discounted ice maker. This one from Frigidaire has great customer reviews, and during the Walmart's Deal Days, it's down to just $79 for that sweet, crisp countertop ice ‚Äî the lowest price we've seen. Save $50¬†$79 at Walmart It's iced coffee season! Whip one up faster than a barista at the end of a shift with this clever hot/iced K-cup device, now just $59. Simply place a glass of ice (tumbler included!) or a mug beneath the drip, make your selection, and your order will be up in a jiffy. The water reservoir holds up to 36 ounces. $59 at Walmart With 4GB of RAM, 64GB of onboard storage and a free one-year subscription to Office 365, this laptop is ideal for everyday use. And a 14-inch screen, a slim profile and a weight of only a few pounds make it ideal for stuffing into a backpack or shoulder bag, for work on the go. $171 at Walmart In the world of hair dryers, the Dyson Supersonic is considered the gold standard. But it comes with a $430 price tag, putting it out of reach for many people. However, this alternative from Nexpure is now on sale for a fraction of that price. This dryer offers a lot of perks to help you get a sleek, salon-worthy blowout, including ionic technology to reduce frizz and ramp up the shine as the hair dries, giving you a smooth look. $36 at Walmart Designed to be worn around the neck, this battery operated bladeless neck fan provides three speeds of cooling air directly where you need it most on a hot day. The air blasts the back of your neck along your hairline where sweat gathers, instantly cooling you down. The hands-free design means that you can wear it while doing other tasks ‚Äî like working, cooking, doing yard work, at a ball game and much, much more. And because it's designed with a low-noise feature, it means that it keeps you cool and free from distractions ‚Äî you can even carry on a conversation while wearing it without problems. $28 at Walmart If you're a Clinique fan, you can get this 4.2-ounce jar of hydrator for more than half-off at Walmart right now. It can provide much-needed moisture to dry or sensitive skin. $18 at Walmart With this smart bird feeder, you can watch and learn about the birds (and, let's be honest, squirrels!) in your own backyard...."
n1vqcty,2025-07-07 22:05:53,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Heeeey, apologies for belated answer, and thanks for such an elaborate response. I do not know why, but dentists here are like, you do not have to spend money on this and that if you have a proper brushing technique, etc. They were even telling me not to by waterpik, but in the end I bought it as an extra help and I also bought a suculus brush. My ortho told me during my last visit that I have about 6 months left until the end of my therapy. That is not too long, and hopefully after that it will be once again much easier to brush my teeth, and I will also check with my perio in a couple of weeks whether she recommends me switching to a sonic brush. When it comes to xylitol powder, I've read about its benefits, but I bought some bubble gums instead. I know that powder version is much more recommended/potent, but I have a small dog, so I am super worried not to accidentally spill some powder on the floor, as I've read it's highly toxic for them. Thanks again for your recommendations! :)"

I do thankfully have the perio tip for the waterpik but was scared to use it in case I made it worse somehow haha. If I use it on the lowest setting though, hopefully it'd be safe! Yeah the hygienist said I didn't seem to have any pockets that would indicate periodontal disease, and she said there wasn't really any buildup (she even said she didn't necessarily think it needed a deep cleaning, but I opted for one just to make sure). Since then, the swelling has reduced and there's only the reddish spot (it looks like a small cluster of petechiae close up?) and I just keep obsessing over it haha. would a reddish petechiae spot be normal/expected after a localized deep cleaning? I was thinking maybe I just keep irritating it when eating (that's what I'm hoping it is at least lol)"

mov_FE07B29E4459C26F0BA9A0EC5E0AE2E8,2025-07-08 08:09:53,en,WEB,"‚Äâ It's that time of year again ‚Äî Amazon Prime Day is officially in full swing. With thousands (okay, hundreds of thousands!) of deals flooding the site, it's easy to feel overwhelmed. But at Yahoo Shopping, we follow one golden rule: a good deal on a bad product isn't really a deal at all. That's where our team of expert shoppers comes in. Over the past year alone, we've hands-on tested hundreds of products ‚Äî from powerful vacuums that actually make cleaning kind of fun, to kitchen tools we swear by, to ultra-comfy shoes you'll never want to take off. To help you figure out what's worth your money, we started by cross-referencing the top-tested picks in our expert shopping guides with what's currently on sale ‚Äî and then dug into the data to make sure those markdowns were the real deal (because nothing's worse than a fake ‚Äúbargain‚Äù). The result? A curated list of legit Prime Day discounts on products our editors have tested, loved and genuinely recommend. Below, you'll find more than a dozen of our favorite tried-and-true items ‚Äî all at prices worth jumping on. But don't wait: while Prime Day runs through Friday, July 11 (yep, it's the longest one yet!) , these standout deals might not last that long. Black+Decker Why we love it: We put over a dozen popular car vacuums to the test, and this compact powerhouse from Black+Decker came out on top. Senior Home Editor Jessica Dodell-Feder was especially wowed by how easily it tackled everything from pebbles and crushed leaves to snack crumbs and chunky dirt. But what really won her over? The impressive reach. ""It has a flexible 4-foot hose with a curved nozzle that helped me easily access the tightest, most awkward spaces,"" she wrote. ""For the first time ever, I was able to get the way under the front seats of my car without having to strain my back or crouch down."" The deal: This is the lowest price we've seen on this vac all year, so if you're thinking about grabbing one, now's the time! $95 at Amazon Waterpik Why we love it: Need a little push to make flossing part of your daily routine? This top-rated water flosser might do the trick. It's our best overall pick for a reason ‚Äî packing a ton of versatility into a sleek, compact design. With 10 pressure settings and seven different tips (yep, even one with a toothbrush head!) , it basically turns your countertop into a mini dental spa. The deal: At only a few bucks more than its Black Friday drop last year to $50, this is the lowest price we've seen on this Waterpik in 2025. So if you've been thinking about upgrading your oral care game, now's the time. $55 at Amazon RoC Why we love it: Good news: When it comes to under-eye cream, you don't have to spend a fortune to get results. Senior Beauty Editor Jennifer Romolini swears by this budget-friendly find. ""If you're looking for a low-cost retinol treatment to help with dark pigmentation, this is for you,"" she wrote. ""RoC is the premier name in over-the-counter retinol, and its eye cream is highly rated ... It's excellent for improving the appearance of both fine lines and dark circles, and it's dermatologist-recommended too. I only wish it contained more antioxidant, nourishing ingredients. But for the price, it honestly cannot be beat."" Translation? Your eyes can look fresher and brighter draining your bank account. Win-win! The deal: This is about as low as we've seen it in months. For an even better deal, RoC is also selling this winning under-eye cream as a duo with its Deep Wrinkle Anti-Aging Night Face Cream for just $31 (that's 15% off). $20 at Amazon Ninja Why we love it: With six cooking functions, an easy-to-use display and the ability to cook two different foods at once, this mighty Ninja Foodi has definitely earned its spot on our list of the best air fryers of 2025. And we're not the only ones obsessed ‚Äî over 33,000 Amazon shoppers have given it a five-star review. Home & Garden Writer Kristin Granero claims it's a total game-changer for bigger households, thanks to its dual baskets. And when you need to go big? Just remove the center divider to create one mega space for roasting and crisping. ""With the center insert removed, we successfully roasted an entire chicken, complete with sides, in about an hour, with only a few minutes of preheating and without heating the entire kitchen in the process,"" she wrote...."
1luj402,2025-07-08 08:17:03,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Not sure what to do anymore. I'm 25 and I drink occasionally and do have history of teeth grinding. I had braces done in 2016 so they made a special retainer for teeth grinding after discovering the grinding in 2020 or so. I clean my retainer at least once every two weeks with either hydrogen peroxide or just regular soap, my teeth twice a day (with sensodyne toothpaste and soft bristle toothbrush), and I floss every night. My hygienist told me I have some level 5 pockets and since my flossing technique was fine she recommend I get a water flosser. I did indeed get a water flosser (not the waterpik kind but one from Amazon; has 5 levels and is handheld). I followed her instructions to use the water flosser and regular floss until I could build up to the strongest level on the water flosser which I did then I switched to mainly user the water flosser. I will still occasionally use regular floss (maybe once or twice a week). I still bleed even with the water flosser and with the regular floss despite my flossing technique being fine. I'm not sure what to do anymore. Last visit they saw no bone loss and they schedule my next visit 6 months out (I think it's in September/October). Should I go back to see my dentist early for a deep clean? I'm not sure what else to do about the bleeding but I know it's not a good sign. I just don't understand how I'm still bleeding despite flossing nightly with regular floss for a few years and then making these changes to accommodate."

In early May 2025, the company unveiled a major shift: it had begun relocating production for key items, like Waterpik flossers, out of China. Management expects this adjustment to trim roughly 80% of its ~$190 million anticipated annual tariff exposure. On June 2, 2025, RBC Capital Markets analysts raised CHD's rating from Sector Perform to Outperform and raised its price target from $100 to $114. RBC noted that ongoing engagement with CHD's leadership, particularly the CEO and CFO, reinforced their view that the company's current guidance accurately reflects ongoing challenges. A retail employee stocking shelves with consumer packaged goods/manufacturing products. They also highlighted CHD's acquisition of Touchland as a strategic and growth-positive move, citing the brand's strong loyalty and distribution potential. Essentially, RBC believes CHD has the right blend of tariff mitigation and portfolio expansion to regain momentum. Church & Dwight (NYSE:CHD) makes and sells everyday essentials like Arm & Hammer, OxiClean, Waterpik, and Batiste, positioning itself as a defensive stalwart in consumer staples. While we acknowledge the potential of CHD as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

mov_CFCA1CD92806DCC352486E3382C1123A,2025-07-08 16:52:05,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Welcome to SELF Checkout, a series in which we share the wellness-boosting products currently in our carts. In each installment, you can expect to find our staffers' essentials as well as genuinely useful splurges and group-chat-worthy finds. I was raised to shop in bulk (shout out to my mother, who once bought a dozen bags of pretzels because they were on sale, even though no one in our family really liked them). So I naturally view Amazon Prime Day as the perfect opportunity to stock up on the essentials I always end up running low on (hello, dog poop bags, toothbrush heads, deodorant, and coffee filters). But I also recognize Prime Day's value as a time to save on what would otherwise be a pricey purchase (like, say, a vacuum). Luckily, you can fit both types of items in your Amazon cart and still save a nice chunk of change. Even luckier, the retailer has extended its biggest sale of the year by two extra days‚Äîso you can shop a little today, then come back for more tomorrow, Thursday, and Friday. Not sure where to start? We're keeping track of all the best deals right here. And below, you can see what we're adding to our own carts this Prime Day. Scroll down for some wellness editor-approved shopping inspo. Sarah Felbin, SELF's senior commerce editor Amazon Smart Plug To make her life a little easier (and more futuristic), Felbin stocks up on these smart plugs. ‚ÄúI can control them remotely using the Amazon Alexa app on my phone‚Äîmeaning I can turn my A/C on from miles away, so my apartment is nice and cool by the time I get home,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúThey're also great for lights‚Äîyou can turn them on hands-free, just ask Alexa.‚Äù Dr. Loretta Intense Replenishing Serum Felbin, who has ‚Äúsuper sensitive skin,‚Äù also loves how thick and nourishing this hydrating serum feels. ‚ÄúIt's a little pricey, but it usually goes on sale for Prime Day, so you can bet it's in my cart,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúTwo pumps is enough for my face and neck, and even though the bottle is pretty small, it lasts a while.‚Äù Therabody TheraFace Pro Curious about red light therapy, microcurrent treatments, or facial massage? You can get a feel for all three with the SELF Healthy Beauty Award‚Äìwinning TheraFace Pro. You'll be in good company, as Felbin will likely add one to her cart this year too: ‚ÄúLots of SELF staffers love theirs, and I'm thinking Prime Day is the perfect time to take the plunge and grab one for myself,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúGirl math says it'll save me hundreds on pricey treatments and facials later down the road.‚Äù Her logic is sound. Milk Makeup Lip + Cheek Stick Like me, Felbin's using Prime Day to restock her old reliables, including Milk's super versatile blush stick. ‚ÄúI love the color Werk‚Äîit's a really pretty pink that gives me the perfect, natural-looking flush,‚Äù she says, adding she may give the Quirk and Dash shades a try too. Jessica Kasparian, SELF's commerce writer Apple AirPods Pro 2 Kasparian basically lives in her AirPods: ‚ÄúI seriously wear them every single day to listen to music and podcasts, take calls, and drown out NYC noise.‚Äù Her trusty old pair have gone kaput, so she's using Prime Day as an opportunity to upgrade to a pair of Pro 2s. ‚ÄúMy boyfriend and I use our Nespresso coffee maker every day, and restocking on pods can get pricey,‚Äù Kasparian explains. Buying up their favorite flavors while they're 20% off should help. Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray Medium In the name of reducing heat wave-induced frizz, Kasparian will be bringing Moroccanoil's Luminous hairspray back into her routine. ‚ÄúI used to use this hairspray years ago and have been missing it lately, as the summer humidity has been wreaking havoc on my hair,‚Äù she says. ‚ÄúIt's a fine mist that leaves my hair looking shiny, and I love its fresh scent.‚Äù Cyklar Nutrient Rich Body Cream ‚ÄúI can't get enough of this Cyklar Nutrient Rich Body Cream‚ÄîI love the Sacred Santal and Vanilla Verve scents,‚Äù Kasparian says. She's overdue for a restock‚Äîand while she's at it, she may give the matching body wash a try too. Sara Coughlin, SELF's senior commerce writer..."

It's an easy way to help maintain your dental hygiene, especially those harder to reach spaces in your mouth. Waterpik is like the Kleenex of the water flosser world and the Aquarius is our favorite model overall. It's powerful, versatile and carries an ADA seal of approval‚Äîwhich is not universal to all water flossers. This Prime Day deal is the best price we've seen for this model in 2025. Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0 Smokeless Fire Pit With Stand Fire pits are a year-round staple, whether you're camping, posted up at the beach or hanging out in your backyard. Solo Stove's portable smokeless design is our favorite fire pit overall for its efficiency and versatility. Just be warned: I let my dad borrow mine for a road trip and he never gave it back. A 20% discount on the solo stove is not atypical, but it's still a nice opportunity to grab one on sale if you're in the market. Field Company No.8 Cast-Iron Skillet This upgraded cast-iron is ideal for home cooks ready to invest in an heirloom-quality piece. The Field's skillet is lightweight‚Äîroughly a pound lighter than other designs we tested‚Äîand has a smooth cooking surface that helps create a nonstick barrier for delicate foods like eggs. Better yet: This discount is the best price we've seen for this skillet on Amazon. Supergoop PLAY Everyday Lotion SPF 50 Our favorite sunscreen hydrates, calms and protects your skin from the sun without leaving you feeling greasy. Its formula helps block UVA, UVB and infrared radiation, and it can hold up against sweat and water for over an hour. You can also use the lotion head-to-toe for quick, full-body coverage. Supergoop hosts semi-regular sales online, but this is still a great time to stock up for summer. Away The Bigger Carry-On Luggage You've likely heard of Away by now. The trendy suitcase brand is a favorite among our editors and the maker of our pick for the best carry-on luggage overall. The Bigger Carry-On is spacious, durable and thoughtfully designed with an internal compression system that makes it easier to fit everything you need in your bag. This 20% discount is limited to select colorways, including the pictured Cloud Gray above. Other colors are available for 15% off. St.Tropez Self Tan Express Mousse We love a sun-kissed tan; a good self-tanner can help give you that beachy look without the potential sun damage. Our favorite formula is an easy-to-apply mousse that absorbs quickly...."

Up to 28% off a popular foot exfoliant with results that are equal parts disgusting and oh-so-satisfying. Within one to two weeks, the dead skin on your feet will literally start to peel off (gross!) and reveal the supremely soft skin that was hiding underneath (satisfying!) . Check it out in action on TikTok ! Promising review: ""I was dubious at first, having seen this on TikTok. I can now confirm that it works as directed, and the results are amazing. 24 hours after I soaked my feet in the plastic bag, nothing happened. Then, 48 hours later, it started working. 72 hours, and it was in full working mode. Like other reviewers, I also suggest just letting the skin come off naturally. As someone who wears flip-flops often, I opted for socks and shoes during the shedding period to capture the skin, even when sleeping, because who wants chunks of dead skin in their bedsheets?! (it sounds so gross, but you'll understand once you do it) The shedding lasts for a few days. The results are incredible. Will use this again!"" ‚ÄîVanessa Price: $14.38 (originally $19.99; available in five scents) 2. 50% off Philips Sonicare ~ExpertClean~ toothbrush (at its best price, and the first time it's been this price since *October 2022*) because if your manual toothbrush from the 1900s isn't giving you a deep cleaning to remove annoying food particles, this will! It comes with a charging case for traveling, and it even has a SENSOR THAT TELLS YOU IF YOU'RE BRUSHING TOO HARD. The technology we have!! Promising review:¬†""I've been flying through a few of the cheapest sonicares for years, and after frustration, I caved and paid for this high-end one. It's really a treat to have a cadillac of a toothbrush! So many options. It's so nice to have a simple on and off button instead of one button controlling all the settings and taking forever to turn the brush off. This brush has one simple power button. A separate button to change the various modes to brush with and when the brush is on you can adjust power level. The brush comes with some really fancy brush heads, and they are a game changer. I might have to buy brand name brush heads after this. They're longer and curve to hit your teeth just right. You will instantly feel the difference after brushing with a sonicare, treat yourself to a higher end one. Your dental hygiene is worth it. You're worth it."" ‚ÄîCharlotte Price:¬†$99.96¬†(originally $199.95; available in three colors) ‚Äî and shop all the Philips Sonicare deals here. The Sonicare Protective Clean toothbrush is 36% off, bringing it down to $69.95. 3. And! 45% off a Waterpik Water Flosser that can work wonders for improving gum health while getting rid of food gunk stuck in your teeth that your regular toothbrush and floss duo can't do alone. It claims to remove up to 99.9% of plaque with good 'ol water pressure, and make it especially easier to maneuver around braces, implants, and other dental work!..."

The right oral hygiene products should protect against cavities and gum disease, and may even help lower your risk for bigger health issues like diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis. Quick Overview See 5 more ""Your mouth is the gateway to the rest of your body, which means poor oral hygiene can lead to infections that can impact your whole system,"" says a dentist in Las Vegas. In fact, there is substantial evidence linking periodontal disease to several systemic health issues, including stroke, heart disease, diabetes, and rheumatoid arthritis. A healthier mouth may even make for a healthier mind. Research has linked gum disease with an increased incidence of dementia. If you think gum disease happens only to ""other people,"" here's a surprising news flash for you: If you're over 30, flip a coin ‚Äî those are roughly your odds of having periodontitis right now, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This severe form of chronic gum disease quietly eats away at the bone around your teeth, and, yes, it can lead to tooth loss. Here's the good news: You can easily protect your teeth, gums and overall health by regularly caring for your mouth. After speaking with five experts and testing more than 60 products over the course of six months, we've narrowed down the overwhelming wall of dental care options to the absolute best choices. From the best mouthwash to the best tongue scraper, we're here to help you build the ideal oral care arsenal. Read on for our expert-backed, thoroughly tested recommendations. Update, July 8, 2025: We checked all product prices and availability. Several of our top picks are up to 45% off for Amazon Prime Day right now. Best toothpaste Best tongue scraper Best floss and flossing tools Best mouthwash Best water flosser Best toothbrushes Types of oral hygiene products Your mouth deserves the best care possible, and today's dental products make that easier than ever. Whether you're looking to brighten your smile, protect against cavities or maintain healthy gums, understanding the right tools for the job is a must. Let's break down the essentials: Toothbrush: ""Choosing the right toothbrush is key to effective cleaning,"" says Kunik. Soft-bristled manual toothbrushes are great when used correctly because they're gentle on gums and enamel. But electric toothbrushes can take the clean a step further. They're more effective at removing plaque and improving gum health, making them a worthwhile investment. Interdental brush: Also known as mini brushes, interdental brushes are ideal for cleaning significant gaps between teeth or around braces, bridges and implants, says Kunik. Mini brushes are also an A+ choice for people with gum recession or periodontal issues. (But make sure to consult your dentist before using.) String floss: Flossing is a crucial step for removing debris and plaque from between teeth, areas your toothbrush can't reach. And finding the best floss is simple ‚Äî it's the one you'll actually use, says White. What matters most of all is simply making flossing a consistent part of your routine. Water flosser: Water flossers use an adjustable pressurized stream of water to remove food and plaque between your teeth. They're especially effective for folks with braces, implants, gum disease or sensitive gums, says White. Floss pick: This convenient device consists of a string of dental floss attached to a plastic handle. While a great choice for flossing on the go, Marashi notes that it's not as effective as traditional floss. Tongue scraper: This U-shaped metal or plastic tool is useful for removing bacteria, food debris and dead cells from the surface of the tongue, says Wei. Using a tongue scraper regularly can help promote better oral health and reduce bad breath. Mouthwash: Regularly swishing mouthwash allows you to reach areas in your mouth that may be missed by brushing and flossing alone. ""Choose a mouthwash that fits your oral health needs, such as fluoride mouthwash for cavity prevention or antibacterial mouthwash for gum health,"" says Wei. At-home oral care is essential ‚Äî and so is care from a dentist. ""Only a professional cleaning can remove calcified plaque (tartar) stuck between your teeth, below the gum line and on top. No mouthwash, brushing or flossing can fix this. You must have it professionally removed,"" says Marashi. The American Dental Association recommends dental cleaning every six months or, if you have gum issues, every three to four months. Factors to consider when purchasing oral hygiene products..."

Absolutely amazing because flossing never works for me.

Truly, Bell has one of the most in all of Hollywood, and she takes proper care of her pearly whites to ensure they dazzle. You won't catch her using Crest or Colgate. Nope, the actress' favorite dental brand happens to be . Bell has openly praised this cosmetic dentist-founded brand over the years, but her favorite product is a game-changer for those with busy schedules. Whether she's on set or jetsetting around the world, you can always find the in her purse. ‚Äúit's so easy to use anywhere ‚Äì and I keep packets with me on set because, as an actor, it's so important to have fresh breath! It's genius,‚Äù This isn't your average, though. These handy little packets act as an all-in-one mouth refresher, removing plaque and whitening teeth quickly and efficiently. All you have to do is open the packet, add a dash of water, swish for 30 seconds and spit. You'll experience the freshness immediately, and it only takes a few uses to notice the stain-removing effect. The little is extra convenient on travel days, though shoppers who have discovered this innovation find themselves using it daily. ‚ÄúThis is perfect for travel. I find it more gentle than regular, liquid mouthwashes,‚Äù ‚ÄúIn fact, it's become my everyday mouthwash regardless of travel because it does help me maintain the whiteness of my teeth.‚Äù Others have gotten innovative with how they incorporate the into their routines. ‚ÄúI don't want to sound like an ad, but this stuff is so versatile,‚Äù . ‚ÄúI mix a few packets into my WaterPik flosser's dam and get whiter teeth as I water floss. I also pop a few in my bag to use as mouthwash on the go. I even use it as travel toothpaste to clean/extra whiten, pouring a bit of the powder directly on a damp toothbrush.‚Äù Ready to smile like Bell? Head to Amazon to nab her go-to oral care before the secret's out! Get the for $29 at Amazon! Please note, prices are accurate as of the publishing date but are subject to change.

El Waterpik Ultra, apto para quienes utilizan ortodoncia o tienen condiciones espec√≠ficas de salud dental, incluye siete boquillas distintas para abordar diversas necesidades. Su dise√±o compacto y f√°cil manejo lo convierten en una opci√≥n pr√°ctica, aunque algunos usuarios han se√±alado que el bot√≥n del mango podr√≠a presentar fallas con el tiempo y que el dep√≥sito no es extra√≠ble, complicando su mantenimiento. Sin embargo, la mayor√≠a coincide en que el costo inicial es una inversi√≥n que vale la pena, especialmente considerando sus m√∫ltiples beneficios. Leer noticia completa en 20minutos .

Not to mention the new deals that pop up as we make our way through this four-day bacchanal of bargains. We're talking all-time lows from the like of , Bissell, and more. Now, there's no telling how long each sale will last ‚Äî we're already seeing prices change from one day to the next. Our advice? Scoop up the discounts that catch your eye while you can. Now, if you're feeling a little overwhelmed, that's understandable ‚Äî there are thousands of deals to weed through, including new deals that just popped up today. But not all of them are worth your time. That's what our team of shopping editors is here for; we spend all of our waking hours hunting down the deals, not the ones with inflated original pricing or those products boasting the same ""50% off"" for the better part of a year. With that in mind, here are the best for day two we recommend adding to cart ASAP. Trending Prime Day deals Best Prime Day deals: Our best-tested products Apple Why we love it: Never lose your keys, luggage, purse or anything else ever again. Just attach one of these trackers and your phone will always know where it is. Senior Tech Writer Rick Broida named the Apple AirTag the for iPhone users because it supports ultra-wideband (UWB) wireless technology on top of Bluetooth. ""When your phone is within range, you don't have to rely on just beeps (which might be muffled or drowned out by other noise); an onscreen compass arrow points you in the right direction, in real time,"" he wrote. ""That definitely gives it a big leg up on competing trackers that use Apple's Find My network; UWB is exclusive to AirTags."" The deal: While AirTags are frequently discounted, this is the best deal we've ever seen on this four-pack, bringing each tag down to about $17 (usually $25 each). Save $34 Lowest price ever $65 at Amazon Stanley Why we love it: The Stanley IceFlow landed a spot on our list of the because, unlike the brand's FlowState tumbler, this one proved to be 100% leak-proof with the flip straw folded. On top of that, because you can easily flip the IceFlow straw down when not in use, we found that dirt and debris weren't as likely to get through. The foldable, flexible lid handle makes for compact packing and easy carrying, too! The deal: This is a truly rare sale ‚Äî at 34% off, it's the lowest price we've ever seen. Save $14 Lowest price ever $26 at Amazon Neutrogena Why we love it: Topping our list of the recommended by dermatologists is this lightweight, fast-absorbing fave from Neutrogena. It's got everything you want in a daily SPF: high protection, zero greasy mess and a matte finish. As Dr. Joshua Zeichner told us, ‚ÄúThis sunscreen has been clinically tested and shown to give better sunburn protection compared to sunscreens with lower SPFs.‚Äù The deal: This is the lowest price we've seen on this cult-favorite SPF all year, so go ahead and stock up before it's gone. $7 at Amazon Samsung Why we love it: If you're in the market for the , Senior Tech Writer Rick Broida says that Samsung's The Frame is the way to go. ""If your primary goal is to buy a new TV that can also class up your decor, the Frame is pretty great,"" he wrote in his . ""I love the art selection, love the way art looks on the low-glare matte screen, love how people are genuinely fooled ‚Äî from a distance, anyway ‚Äî into thinking there's an actual painting on the wall."" While he notes that the TV isn't without its flaws (including a buggy app and poor setup instructions), it offers surprisingly decent speakers and vibrant, well-balanced color. The deal: The Frame Series goes on sale fairly regularly, but this is the lowest price we've ever seen the 55-inch model listed for. (Take note that the is also on sale for 40% off, too!) Save $700 Lowest price ever $798 at Amazon VITRUVI Why we love it: Essential oil diffusers scent your home without sprays or candles ‚Äî and this one's a standout. Home & Garden Writer Kristin Granero named Vitruvi's model the for its sculptural design and simple setup. ""This ceramic vessel from Vitruvi is compact, but its intuitive design, performance and captivating glow make it a winner,"" she wrote...."

One of the sexual wellness brand's most buzzed-about innovations, Pleasure Air Technology, has seen a slew of discounts across a variety of toys. This tech is famed for creating a 'sucking' sensation and has garnered top-notch reviews. The most wallet-friendly item in the lineup is the Womanizer Starlet, which normally retails at ‚Ç¨49 but now boasts a 35% discount, bringing it down to just ‚Ç¨31.85. As the most affordable option, it comes with four intensity levels, yet satisfied customers claim it's a game-changer. READ MORE:Oasis resale tickets - Cheapest last-minute Oasis reunion tickets as desperate fans rush to resales READ MORE:Top-rated Waterpik flosser slashed 32% in Amazon Prime Day's big beauty deals A reviewer shared: ""This toy (too slight a term) has changed my life. I am in my 50s, and a friend recommended the Womanizer. It's not just another vibrator - it's a whole different level of experience."" For those willing to splash out a bit more, the Womanizer Pro40 remains a firm favourite among Lovehoney staff. Now priced at ‚Ç¨79.20, down from ‚Ç¨99, this enhanced model features six intensity modes, reports the Irish Mirror. With thousands of positive reviews, it's no shock that shoppers are raving: ""Best orgasms I've had by far without another human involved. It's hard to tell exactly what it's doing and why it feels amazing - which is a bit weird at first, but I got over it quickly."" There's a massive range of toys reduced on the site The Womanizer Next 3D, which provides depth control for the sucking sensation, has similarly seen a price drop, with a 20% discount reducing it to ‚Ç¨167. Despite the Womanizer range being hugely popular, shoppers note that they do necessitate a two-handed approach, leading some thrill seekers to favour the likes of the Lovehoney Jessica Rabbit Vibrator, now reduced by 30% to ‚Ç¨27.99, or the We-Vibe Tango X Bullet, currently priced at ‚Ç¨71.20. Lelo offers similar toys in their collection, such as the Sona 2 and Dot, currently discounted in LookFantastic's latest sale. Boots also boasts a vast range of toys on their website, catering to both men and women, like the ‚Ç¨24.99 Arcwave Ghost Stroker or the ‚Ç¨139.99 Tor 2 from Lelo. However, they're not the only brand offering rings. The We-Vibe Bond Wearable Ring, controllable via app and remote control, has been slashed by 40% on Amazon, bringing it down from ‚Ç¨129 to ‚Ç¨77.40. Lovehoney's toy cleaners and lubricants are also currently discounted on Amazon. The full range of sale options can be found here."

Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask This cult favorite leave-on lip mask by Laneige is a favorite among Forbes Vetted editors for delivering deep hydration and antioxidants as you sleep. ‚ÄúI keep the Laneige mask on my nightstand and slather it on before bed,‚Äù says special projects editor Jennifer Ferrise.

Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've seen for this lip sleeping mask all year. Limited Edition Dyson Airwrap i.d. Multi-Styler And Dryer Straight+Wavy After testing multiple hair tools for several months, features and special projects director Kim Peiffer named the Dyson Airwrap the best luxury blow dryer brush. ‚ÄúI've had this multi-styling tool for over a year now, and have seen firsthand all that it does‚Äîfrom smoothing strands to adding volume to creating perfect curls that mimic a professional in-salon blowout,‚Äù says Peiffer. During Prime Day, you can score the limited edition model in the color Jasper Plum for $100 less than the typical retail price. Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've seen for this model of the Dyson Airwrap all year. Solawave 4-In-1 Red Light Therapy Facial Wand This portable red light therapy wand targets fine lines and wrinkles, and helps with skin elasticity and firmness.

It also helps reduce facial puffiness after a late night.‚Äù Why It's A Good Deal: This is the second-lowest price we've seen for the Solawave wand this year. Living Proof Perfect Hair Day Dry Shampoo Several members of the Forbes Vetted team have tried and loved this formula from Living Proof‚Äîso much so, it earned the title of best dry shampoo as a part of the 2024 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards. ‚ÄúThis is the holy grail of dry shampoos,‚Äù says one tester, who has used it regularly for years. ‚ÄúIt's consistently lightweight and volumizing, without leaving behind a chalky feel.‚Äù Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've seen for this dry shampoo all year. Nood Flasher 2.0 Kit Just in time for swimsuit season, the Nood Flasher 2.0 makes at-home laser hair removal easy. It's our top pick for coarse hair on our list of the best laser hair removal devices. ‚ÄúThe Flasher 2.0 has a thoughtful, compact design that fits nicely in the hand, and it's lightweight enough that lengthier IPL sessions don't feel like a chore,‚Äù says one of our testers. Get it bundled with an exfoliating cleanser and soothing aloe treatment for 24% off. Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've ever seen for this laser hair removal device on Amazon.

Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. 53% off a cat DNA test (it's from Shark Tank!) that'll unlock a whole new world of info about your cat, like whether that gray baby is actually a Russian Blue or some kind of mix. It'll also give info on health markers and traits your cat is likely to have based on their breed ‚Äî so now you'll know *why* your kitty is so uniquely lovable! PS: The dog version is also 50% off! Promising review: ""I purchased this kit because I have an 18-pound green-eyed, long-haired cat, whom everyone asks me about. ' Is she a Maine Coon?' ' Is she part Maine Coon?' I had no idea as to her lineage, as I found her struggling for her survival on the street and had no idea who her parents were. She turned out not to be a Maine Coon, but showed similar ancestry to rag dolls. Believable, as she's very people-friendly and almost acts like a dog. However, the most important part of this test is the health reports. I've sent a copy to her veterinarian, so that we can be on the lookout for anything she may be predisposed to and to have the vet give suggestions as to how to avoid certain outcomes. I'm very happy with the test and recommend it to anyone with concerns about their cat's health or curiosity about their lineage."" ‚ÄîMadouc Price: $74.99 (originally $159) 2. 50% off a pair of HEYDUDE canvas slip-on loafers you've likely seen ALL over the internet, because they're just *that* comfy. (And fashionable without being too flashy, you know?) At this price, you ought to snag a couple pairs to see you through the rest of the summer *and* fall. Just be ready to hear a lot of, ""Hey dude! Where did you get those?"" Promising reviews: ""My husband loved these so much that he bought a second pair! He is usually a 9.5, and I therefore bought a size 10, and it fit him great! They are high quality and excellent support, not to mention look great! They are easy to slip on and off, which is an additional perk."" ‚ÄîElizabeth Nelson ""Great shoes. Always get that brand. Perfect for work specially if you walk a lot."" ‚ÄîJorge A. Price: $32.49 (regularly $64.99; available in sizes 7‚Äì15 and four colors) 3. 50% off a Waterpik Water Flosser that can work wonders for improving gum health while getting rid of food gunk stuck in your teeth that your regular toothbrush and floss duo can't do alone. It claims to remove up to 99.9% of plaque with good 'ol water pressure, and make it especially easier to maneuver around braces, implants, and other dental work! Promising review:¬†""So...this Waterpik is amazing. I had 4mm and 5mm periodontal pockets from not flossing and also experienced some bone loss, I also had to get a very uncomfortable deep gum pocket cleaning. I literally hated flossing and would find myself avoiding to floss, even though I needed it very much. My gums were red, swollen, and inflamed because I was in the early stages of periodontal disease. I started using the Waterpik flosser and instantly liked this way of flossing much better! After using it consecutively each night for only five days my gums were noticeably better and felt much better. After two weeks of using the Waterpik flossing, coconut oil pulling, and mouthwash treatment,¬†my gums have done a complete 180 and my mouth and gums are starting to heal properly!..."
n2nltd8,2025-07-12 01:30:32,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Fun story i was always complimented by my dentist because I floss every day. Stupidly (or thanks to marketing), i thought waterpik would be a direct substitute for flossing and did it for a year. When I went back to my dentist, he went, ""whoa, what happened?"" and went on to explain it is not the same thing at all. So back to flossing I went."

n2xl3em,2025-07-13 17:40:29,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Check out interdental brushes, they come in all different sizes so they'll fit very tight spaces or wide gaps. There are also things called soft picks and various names. One of the latter is GUM (brand) Soft-Picks Advanced, Easy to Use Dental Picks for Teeth Cleaning and Gum Health, Disposable Interdental Brushes. They're @7 cents each on Amazon but once you find them you'll see that there are lots of options! I wouldn't go for the cheapest, straight plastic ones that are priced too good to be true. (They prove why that saying exists, instead.) But you'll see some that look nearly identical to the ones I named for you. The first interdental brush I mentioned is like a very thin, small toothbrush. You'll see that the handles relate to the size. I believe Orange is for very small spaces(?) but please check as I'm not positive. They will have bristles similar to a toothbrush but not as packed and not nearly as long. The second ones are bendable rubber with little bumps on the ends. They taper to a skinny point at the tip that will fit between my tightest teeth. And I'm talking about upper molars that act like floss shredders/cutters! I think you might have more success and better results with those as you can control the contact with your gums and over time your gums will become used to and thankful for the attention. I promise. You can grab a single pack at your local grocery/pharmacy store. A few bucks at Walmart to try them out. But you definitely should look at them at minimum. I don't want you to end up at the dentist hearing that you've developed periodontal disease! It requires a special cleaning that most insurers don't cover and it is the one linked to higher risk of heart attack. Sorry. I'm not trying to scare you. I just want what's best for you, I promise. And a Waterpik is fine, good even. But it doesn't replace flossing and these interdental brushes and picks? They get @20% better cleaning than flossing! Please update me after you check them out?? If you hate both, I'll find something else. Have a great day!"
