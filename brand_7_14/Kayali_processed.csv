I think this KORRES Body Milk it's nice, similar to the Ginger Soufflé by Origins but the scent is more subtle in the Korres . You don't like the banana smell either 😂😂 I totally feel you 😅 I never tried the Artisan Parfumeur Banana scent... I guess I was to scared to do it 😅 but when I have the opportunity, I will remember you and give it a sniff... It's so nice when can get over my ""traumas "" 😂 and actually enjoy the scent I thought was not for me ! The Kayali it's really yummy ! What a surprise ! Thanks for watching 🙏🏻❤"

Who's washing their hair today? In my last reel I shared my wash n go routine  using a new gel and here are my final results! After doing a wash n go, I always wait until my curls are fully dry before stretching them. This helps me maintain definition at the roots while adding that extra volume and shape I love—without causing unnecessary frizz or disrupting my curl pattern. Stretching also helps me get more wear out of my style throughout the week. It keeps my hair from shrinking too much and helps with minimizing tangles. I shared my complete Wash N Go routine on YouTube channel, including the products and techniques I use to get this definition.

mzxktsl,2025-06-26 18:53:12,en,REDDIT,"  First I wore Kayali Yum Boujee Marshmallow (and my uber driver this morning was SUCH a creep about it oh my god. Told me “jokes” too that I definitely cannot ever repeat, so heinous and disgusting. Guess I'll only wear this one if I know I have a ride to work) but it wore off within 4 hours so now I'm wearing a custom perfume from Lovesick that I just ordered a full bottle of. This one is called **Wild Faerie** and I'm so obsessed, I can't stop wearing it lately. The notes are dried flowers, lavender marshmallow, thunderstorm, vanilla suede, vanilla bean, lavender coconut milk, rice petals & shea butter, whipped cream, white musk. I did sooo good coming up with this one lmao. It's very pretty, like when you first roll it on you get that thunderstorm note which I can only describe as a rainy day electrified by lightning. Like I can genuinely smell the storm on me, which also opens in a blend with the lavender marshmallow note and it's so gorgeous. The lavender marshmallow continues to waft at me for the entirety of its wear but if I smell it up close, then I get the other notes like the lavender coconut milk, the vanilla bean and vanilla suede, the white mus… it's just insanely pretty. I feel like a wild faerie when I wear it for sure. I just ordered this one along with two other customs I full sized AND got a bespoke travel altar as well! So excited for that. New to having a witchy altar in my craft, I had kept my stuff in a shoebox but now I do have some things on a bookshelf in my room. I'm excited to get that order!! Oh and I also bit the bullet and ordered from Mythpunk Olfactive. Ya know, just to see what happens. I had found an old visa gift card so I decided to order a few samples with it because I've wanted to try them for like a year but ofc they were on hiatus 🙃 but since it wasn't money in my bank account if something goes wrong then at least it wasn't really a loss. well at least that's what I'd be telling myself lmao. I'll be sure to update you guys on my order. But based on what I've read about the evaporation issues (whyyy were those not addressed??? I do not get it) I will be decanting the samples into 2ml rollers to hopefully prevent that from happening for as long as possible. Even though I've never tried them I'm genuinely rooting for the brand but I seriously hope they've decided to make everything right with previous customers who never got their stuff. So yeah assuming it comes, stay tuned for some brutally honest Mythpunk reviews. TW: the planned parenthood bs. Ok so I know free talk is tomorrow but I just wanna cry hearing about what they're doing to Planned Parenthood. How dare they. I go there every three months for my BC or for any other feminine health issues I may have because they've always been there for me, including when I was homeless at age 19. Therefore I am so damn sad for all the patients in this godforsaken country who will possibly lose their access to affordable healthcare because of all the freaks in this nation who think it's okay to dictate others bodies and take their rights away. Why are you wasting your life being so hateful and acting this horrific. I hate it here. Anywayyy have a great day friends, I hope you feel as good as you smell!!!"

Palestinians try to buy bread from a bakery in Rafah, as food shortages continue to worsen. Fatima Shbair/AAP. However, Egypt, the only country aside from Israel that has a border with Gaza, has rebuffed pressure to accept Palestinian refugees displaced by Israel. Reports have indicated that Israeli officials have tried to lobby international support to compel Egypt to accept refugees from Gaza. Egyptian President Abdel Fattah Al-Sisi, however, has been adamant in refusing to allow humanitarian corridors or the entry of large numbers of Palestinians into Sinai. He has called it a “red line” that, if crossed, would “liquidate the Palestinian cause”. In recent days, the UN's High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, has validated Egypt's position. Grandi said displacing Gazans to Egypt would be “catastrophic” for both Egypt and the Palestinians, who, he indicated, would likely not be allowed to return. Why Egypt is opposed to the idea There are a few reasons for Egypt's opposition. The first is that Egypt does not want to be seen to be facilitating ethnic cleansing through the permanent resettlement of Palestinians outside of Gaza. In October, a leaked document from Israel's Intelligence Ministry included recommendations to forcibly transfer of Gaza's population of 2.3 million out of the territory and into tent cities in Egypt's Sinai Desert. Government ministers Bezalel Smotrich and Itamar Ben-Gvir have also both openly advocated the expulsion of Palestinians from Gaza to make way for their replacement by Israeli settlers. Further, in January, a conference in Israel calling for this very plan was attended by 11 members of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's cabinet and 15 additional members of parliament. While Netanyahu last month said Israel has “no intention of permanently occupying Gaza”, he hasn't shut down talk from his ministers about it. When asked about the conference in January, for example, he said everyone was “entitled to their opinions”."

1lprdn3,2025-07-02 09:28:19,en,REDDIT,"  Hello guys ! I am an amateur perfume collector. I only own a couple of Perfumes and would love to grow my collection. Here are the Perfumes I currently own/owned and will repurchase: Macaron d'amande by Jeanne arthes : cheap vanilla almond gourmand, great for layering with summery scents. Khair pistachio: I like it its just more sweet than nutty. Would love a recommendation for a nuttier pistachio scent. Delice nacré: cheap perfect signature scent. It's clean musky sweet and slightly floral. I hate floral Perfumes but this one is just perfect. (I looked for this EVERYWHERE but couldn't find it only on Amazon for triple the original price:((  i am almost running out) Eclaire: I like it but it's too cloying. Sol de Janeiro 62 : I like it but honestly not worth the price ://. Eilish n1: perfect winter scent I get lots of compliments from it. Based on my current collection please tell me whether these Perfumes would be a good purchase (I love vanilla, plain, sweet, slightly spicy but not too much. I also like gourmand pistachios, caramels ans musky clean scents) I am planning to add to my collection (never smelled any of these): Delice ambré: giving that delice nacré is my signature scent I thought I would enjoy this too . Kenzo amour. Britney spears intimate fantasy. Latte Abyad. Juliette has a gun vanilla vibes. Kayali Capri in a bottle. Shaghaf oud tonka. Please if you have any other suggestions drop them in the comments."

These fruity fragrances have a versatile and rich scent, and experts agree: “Cherry can be the star of the fragrance or in a supporting role adding a layer of sweetness or sultriness to the scent,” says Linda G. Levy, president of The Fragrance Foundation. If you're looking to dive into this crave-worthy scent, we spoke with Glamour editors and perfumers to find the best ones, from iconic luxury high-end options to ones you can pick up at your local drugstore. Our top pick overall is Fine'ry Not Another Cherry Eau de Parfum, because it's affordable at under $50 and perfectly encapsulates the juicy note without being too sweet or sultry. But there are plenty more delightful cherry fragrances out there for every occasion. The best cherry perfumes, at a glance How we tested cherry perfumes AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevron We tested cherry perfumes by evaluating their notes, how sweet or tart they were and how long they lasted after application. The best ones had complex cherry notes and other scents and flavors like woods, vanilla and florals. They also weren't overly sweet or cloying, and lasted all day long, even after a full eight hours at work. Best Overall: Fine'ry Not Another Cherry Eau de Parfum Courtesy of brand Original photo from Alanna Martine Kilkeary testing Fine'ry Not Another Cherry Eau de Parfum ChevronChevron Fine'ry Not Another Cherry Eau de Parfum $43 Amazon Notes: Wild cherry, turkish rose, amaretto Size: 2 fl oz Best for: Someone who wants a versatile and luxurious-smelling cherry perfume without breaking the bank This eau de parfum is a favorite of Glamour commerce writer Alanna Martine Kilkeary simply because it captures the fruit at its finest (pun intended). It blends cherry with almond amaretto and turkish rose for a sweet, sensual scent that's appropriate for day time and evening hours. “I love spritzing this on when I have a packed day heading from the office to events after work. It not only lasts a full eight hours, it also blends nicely with my skin's natural scent and makes me smell sweet but not overly saccharine. It's versatile enough to wear to different events during the day or at night, and it smells like luxury in a bottle at under $50!” Best Splurge: Tom Ford Lost Cherry Courtesy of brand Original photo from Alanna Martine Kilkeary testing Tom Ford Lost Cherry ChevronChevron Tom Ford Lost Cherry $255 $190 Amazon Notes: Black cherry, bitter almond, vanilla Size: 1 fl oz Best For: Someone looking for a signature date night perfume If you're already familiar with cherry scents and want to splurge on your next one, you can't go wrong with this iconic option by Tom Ford. With notes of black cherry, bitter almond and vanilla, it's suitable for special occasions and date nights. The brand also has other takes on the Lost Cherry eau de parfum, including Cherry Smoke, which is a warmer, spicier option and Electric Cherry, which is floral and more effervescent. “Electric Cherry is truly an explosion of cherry that is surprisingly wearable and addictive,” says Levy. Best Budget: Florence by Mills Love Core Hair & Body Mist Courtesy of brand Original photo from Alanna Martine Kilkeary testing Florence by Mills Love Core Hair & Body Mist ChevronChevron Florence by Mills Love Core Hair & Body Mist $18 Ulta Notes: Black cherry, lime blossom, oud Size: 5 fl oz Best For: Someone looking for an everyday, approachable and energetic cherry scent..."
1lpxaf8,2025-07-02 14:28:01,en,REDDIT,"  I had been so curious about them and haven't seen many reviews, so I figured I would post mine! Their TAT is insanely quick which I LOVE! Let's get into it! Here's my ranking scale: 1. I am scrubbing immediately 2. Very underwhelming, probably would not purchase OR scrubbed but would give a second chance 3. Somewhat enjoyable, didn't scrub, could maybe try this again in the future 4. I am probably going to size up from the sample size, I enjoyed this 5. I love it, full size full size full size **Moon Bathing-** *""Lychee fruit, milk, vanilla, jasmine grandiflorum, salt""* Woah. The freshness/tart of the lychee balances the laconic of the milk and sweetness of the vanilla perfectly. This is a fruity gourmand in the best way possible. The light pink is gorgeous, this song smells like Pink in the Night by Mitski if you've ever heard it. I do not smell the salt but maybe it's just what's contributing to the “tart” of the lychee which I adore. As time progresses you can kind of get that floral in the background too. Which I would usually say I could do without but here it builds a solid base. Vibes are definitely light, delicate, fem, fruity, youthful but reserved, clean 4.5/5 **Parakeet-** *""Fizzy grapefruit soda, freshly picked daisies, tiny forget-me-nots, and the powdery sweet down feathers of a well groomed parakeet""* Omg why am I slowly coming to realize I love tart?! This smells like a Sweetart/tart candy to me. I think it's the grapefruit that does this. It's very beautiful and summer ish! This is what I would imagine that very pricey Odette fragrance with the swan on it smells like. However, I really do wish the dry down was as effervescent and pretty as the opening. You do still get hits of that grapefruit throughout, but it does become floral dominant and lose some of that fizzy soda aspect (which it does indeed capture perfectly). I feel very split on this only because I think the daisy note isn't for me but I would honestly recommend this to anyone who wants a fizzy grapefruit citrus soda flowery vibe. Of note: My boyfriend, who has to be the pickiest person on earth (maybe I only say this because I subject him to bakery level gourmands which he is not a fan of) LOVES THIS. 3/5 **Alibi-** *""Passionfruit, orange blossom, guava, strawberry yuzu lemonade, and a dash of coconut cream over a rosewood base""* More tart! But this means full tropical and it is beautiful. It is sexy, fruity, tropical, tart, and unapologetic. This immediately transports me to Maui. The coconut keeps it balanced, you can get a dash of it throughout. Personally it leans too fruity and juicy for me. Like you really do smell like a mix of red fruits. I do get the name though, you smell so delicious it's almost too good to be true. This is a great fragrance for sure but it is just not for me personally. 3/5 **A Dog Named Pam-** *""Juniper berry, petitgrain, bitter orange, red mandarin, cedarwood, palo santo, and a warm fuzzy musk that feels to me like the hot belly of a clean dog""* This is what I think Nami from One Piece would smell like. This is a new HG for me. This is bitter orange without being too astringent or violent on the nose...."

'Yet the need for Starmer to tell an uplifting story to Britons about Britain is at least as important as his need to solve some of his more specific policy problems.' On the 12th September Amcham Finland's annual FDI Forum will bring together business leaders, industry experts and decision-makers to discuss global investment trends and Finland's future competitiveness to drive sustainable development and economic growth. It is about the trends in global value chains, technological advancements, geopolitical dynamics and environmental concerns that are increasingly shaping companies' investment decisions – but as with the PM Starmer in the UK (link to the article in the comments) it's also about the VISION that our decision-makers articulate to the businesses (and individuals) that makes all the difference in how attractive they see Finland as a future investment destination. After that it's about solving those specific policy issues. On the 12th September, our impressive speakers (below) will discuss the vision, policies, and international best practices in investment attraction. The in-person event is for Amcham Finland members and key stakeholders by invitation only, but everyone can join us virtually (9am-11am) by clicking this link https://lnkd.in/dr8a69MH Minister of Economic Affairs Sakari Puisto Baedr Kayali, General Manager, AbbVie Finland Casper Herler, Partner, Borenius Douglas van den Berghe, CEO, NxtZones Eveliina Heinäluoma, MP & the Chairperson of the Helsinki City Council Ida Schauman, Head of Defense & National Security, Amazon Web Services (AWS) Iiris Saittakari, Assistant Professor,  Aalto University School of Business Kalle Härkki, CEO, VTT Philip Duggan, CEO, Nordic Generation Tommi Taskinen, Chairman of the Board, Honeywell (More speakers to be announced soon) Wishing you all a great summer and I look forward to seeing many of you in September!"

1ls7lxs,2025-07-05 11:21:15,en,REDDIT,"  I want to share a fragrance grieveance story of mine. I absolutely adore Cherry Ambition by The 7 Virtues. Looove the opening of this dark boozy but still juicy cherry and on paper I also really like the drydown. It reminds me of Angel's Share but for some reason spicy fragrances with a lot of notes go super dusty and powdery and overwhelming on my skin 🥲🥲 same thing happens with Angel's share where the drydown just smells like an oberwhelming powdery mess on me. I wore Cherry Ambition again yesterday and unfortunately after an hour, it just smells like I'm putting my nose into a dusty old makeup bag which I hate. So I think I'll have to sell it and it makes me really sad cause I love everything about The 7 Virtues and own many of their fragrances (Santal Vanille is my signature scent and I also have Amber Vanilla, Coconut Sun & Vetiver Elemi). So now I'm looking into cherry perfumes that can replace it and don't turn so powdery & dusty on me. I'd love a juicy or creamy cherry or even musky. Currently on my list to try: Clean Reserve Whipped Cherry, Kayali Lovefest Burning Cherry, Dolce & Gabbana Q, Sabrina Carpenter Cherry Baby - would love to hear your thoughts on those fragrances and if any of you have a similar problem with perfumes turning overwhelmingly powdery on skin. It happens a lot to me with florals too (apart from jasmine for some reason) For example even Glossier You Fleur turned extremely powdery and vintage smelling on me"

I bought a tester set of Kayali perfumes with 8 minis and my papa liked only this one, the first time in life he has actually liked and wanted anything, I tried finding it everywhere, even across countries, researched so much to find out it's not available now huhhh!!!! I wish I could surprise him with it. Just writing it here as a short not so sweet story of the ordeal to find the perfume hehe. So much love to you❤"
n2457jf,2025-07-09 03:54:39,en,REDDIT,"  Zara Supreme Vanilla, it opens with wood notes and then turns into a sweet vanilla. Bellavita Honey Oud, it's like a lighter version of Khamrah that can even be worn in the summer. It's less than $20 right now on Amazon. This would be my #1 choice if I could only have one spicy vanilla. Bath and Body Works Vanilla Romance smells great and the lotion will keep its scent all day. It layers gorgeously with any perfume that has a bit of spice. Rifaaqat and Lattafa Sehr are not to my liking. I bought both and they smell like gasoline. Rifaaqat turns into a cheap smelling musk after a few hours. Sehr has never made it that long before I had to wash it off. Lattafa Artisan Ethnique is spicy vanilla with a hint of rum. Nebras is an Ellish dupe. Paris Corner December Vanilla is a boozy vanilla patchouli bomb. I smelled it when I got it, and thought no way can I ever wear that, but it grew on me. It feels like being retro, tough and elegant all at the same time. Paris Corner Vanilla Mood is an interesting one. It doesn't smell like vanilla at first, more of a vaguely pleasant scent, then turns to a slightly leathery, sweet vanilla. Miim Miic 94 is a Kayali Vanilla 28 dupe. Miim Miic 108 and Khair Confection are Kayali vanilla candy rock sugar dupes. Both good, Confection is a bit better to me, plus the bottle is pretty."

I've...went a bit crazy All prices and stores are Canadian. Anyway, from left to right: Gooey Butter Cake from The Good Scent. $14 at Winners. Smells divine and matches my Hempz Buttercream Vanilla Cake lotion and lip balm. Sabrina Carpenter Sweet Tooth perfume and matching body spray cause I'm a likes to layer bitch. Walmart. Blind buy! Mugler Angel Eau de Toilette. Amazon Canada Prime deal. Very nice light scent. Also, blind buy! D&C Devotion. Saw one box at Winners, ran to Shoppers to test it, then prayed to the perfume gods and ran back to get it at Winners. Got it for a freakin' STEAL. Kayali Lovefest Burning Cherry. Blind buy (yeah, i know. I have a problem) but I'm soo glad I did! Love it. Hubby went nuts over it. Sephora. Scandal by JPG. I had tried a sampler of the Absolu and loved it but read the original had more honey notes. Went and tried it and loved it even more. Got 20 percent off at Shoppers today with the friends and family deal. Finally, Lattafa Yara Candy. Another blind buy (seriously, I need adult supervision) but I do like it. Like my other Lattafa--Eclaire and Angham--I'm going to let it sit a bit to do it's thing. So, that's it for me for awhile. Probably...maybe."

n2gniiq,2025-07-11 00:15:42,en,REDDIT,"  So I've been buying Middle Eastern  perfumes for over 2yrs. I've educated myself to read the notes on Fragranctica and read reviews also on Amazon ( good source too) Also  YouTube influencers. I've been very, very lucky on blind buys. I only disliked 3 out of 170 bottles. I feel thats a homerun. I just realized I truly love the note of Lychee Rose combo. So I have serveral fragrances with that blended in them but not the star notes. I've seen ""PARIS CORNER KHAIR FUSION"". I bought it. Supposedly dupe of Kayali Sparkling Lychee. And Lychee top note. I'm familiar of the maceration process. But this has to be the most screechy opening. Like sour rinds of citrus (grapefruit). That's not listed in this. It is fruity forward  but hoping this morphs into the fresh frizzy summer sweet Lychee scent . Anyone have this perfume and after your maceration are you happy with it. According to Fragranctica it seems like a 60/40 split on likability. 60 liking....hope it's not a fail for me and it turns into jueville fragrance. I feel the same as ""Lattafa Ansaam Gold"". It's a jueville gummy bear scent supposedly dupe for PDM ""Oriana"" High end perfume. Need some opinions on"""" Khair Fusion"". Thanks"
