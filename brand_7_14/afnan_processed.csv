In my Amazon basket one of the bottles I've got is Club De Nuit (EAU DE TOLIETTE) my question is should I be paying abit more and going for the Parfum version? Or are generally the EDT versions fine for projection and long lasting? For context I'm also about to buy; Afnan Supremacy, Cremo Spice & Black Vanilla EDT but I'm sceptical if I should be avoiding EDT Thanks in advance"
my43mxg,2025-06-16 17:21:31,en,REDDIT,"  I'm personally happy with the EDT version, it's a good starter. As long as you pick the ones that Amazon fulfills you should be fine. Bought plenty through them and have had no issues so far. I also recommend Afnan Supremacy but the Collector's Edition if you like the Aventus DNA. Nice and smoky like CDNIM but more floral. Cremo is nice but doesn't last very long."

In reminding the government that the nation's future does not lie in the prime minister's “vanity symbols”, PAS Youth chief Afnan Hamimi Taib Azamudden criticised the government for “irresponsibly” taking on new commitments. He claimed that while the project is said to have an estimated total cost of RM4 billion, the government quarters project based in Putrajaya could carry a higher financial commitment if financed through a private finance initiative.

1lr893b,2025-07-04 03:04:24,en,REDDIT,"  Hey everyone! Just wanted to take a moment to thank this amazing community, you've all helped me so much over the past few months. The passion, knowledge, and honest feedback here really guided me through my fragrance journey. In the last 4 months, I went all in tried over 150+ decants, visited a few local perfumeries, and explored and owned tons of perfume oils beyond what I'm sharing in this post. After a lot of research (and a bit of obsession), I ended up collecting these fragrances, and let's just say… it became quite the addiction! That said, I've decided to hit pause and not buy any more fragrances for the rest of the year (with one exception that might arrive in the next couple of days). I'll still be around and happy to help anyone here however I can. Thanks again for being such a great part of this journey! **Note**: I am not an expert , I trust my nose more than reviews, please do research or test fragrances before you buy, I am from Middle east / Asia English is not my native language, I apologize in advance for any mistakes i try to explain this in my words without using any AI or correction tool. I am reviewing all fragrances after giving them time to mature. From Top Left to Right: 1. **Icon by Dunhill**: Really Good citrusy, Aromatic and floral scent. A good alternative for those who don't like sweet or overly citrusy scents for summer. 2. **1 Million Prive:** The most complimented one on my list, absolutely amazing winter scent with sweet and tobacco notes; I failed to find anything that can beat that fragrance. 3. **1 Million Elixir:** Very sweet and creamy vanilla with colorful floral tones, especially on the dry down. Lasts a long time and projection is strong. **4. **   **Jasoor:** Clone of VUBIR Coral Fantasy Long Lasting with Good projection, Very Versatile for year-round wear except very hot evenings. **5. **   **Asad Bourbon:** Clone that covers VUBIR Intense, Most Wanted and Stronger with you. Smells cozy and rich. Feels confident and warm. **6. **   **Khamrah :** Amazing Scent, Sweet,  Warm , Cozy with Vanilla and amber. 7. **Khamrah Dukhan:** I tried Liquid Burn, and to my nose, it smells quite similar that same warm, spicy DNA. But Khamrah Dukhan was much cheaper, so I went for it. It's incredibly long-lasting and feels like a spicier, less sweet version of Khamrah. If the sweetness in the original Khamrah isn't your thing, this might be a better fit. Honestly, it's underrated and didn't get the recognition it deserves from early buyers or reviewers. This one needs more attention, it's a hidden gem. 8. **Alpine Homme Sport**: Clone of Allure Homme Sport, as a Sporty scent both last 4-5 hours, and it's enough for a sports session, very good gym scent. 9. **CDN Precieux:** Clone of Aventus Absolu with Twist, Great performance and quality scent better and smoother when compared with Supremacy CE but costs more and feel more expensive **10. ** **Mont Blanc Starwalker:** absolute masterpiece a good night time / bedtime scent. Calming and relaxing, Hyped for a reason very unique scent. **11. ** **Dunhill Desire for a man:** Apple, Citrus and Rose based scent, classic cheap summer scent suitable for any age. 12. **L'Homme by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of L'Homme Lacoste, long lasting, sweet, citrusy fresh scent. FD is a small local perfumery in my area. 13. **L'Homme Intense by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of Dior Homme Intense, Dior Homme intense clones were mostly sold out and its hard to get them in my country so i visited a local perfumery where they had this clone its using same french oils used by other clone houses. I tried it it was very long lasting so i bought the bottle, during testing it last 12+ hours on my skin. 14...."

1lrgzxt,2025-07-04 12:00:40,en,REDDIT,"  As far as I know, I have fallen into the rabbit hole, and my downfall has begun. Here's my take on these fragrances as a noob. I bought them from Whiff Culture, they are very kind and reply to the earliest. # Nautica Voyage: The opening is like a salty cucumber (in a good way) which is refreshing and as the notes suggest the rose is there BUT it has little to negligible smell of it (i got this after sniffing aggressively) and in the dry down the musky and oak note is prominent with the hint of amber which is very relaxing. The projection and longevity of this very poor and not, it's good to wear when you have to stay indoors and do your work, not for outside world definitely. **Scent Profile: 6/10** **Projection: 5/10** **Longevity: 5/10** # Hawas: The opening is very citrusy and frutiy which is very pleasing and mass appealing, in the dry down it has a dominant plum mixed in water like smell and after like 4-5 hours the patchouli starts kicking in. Personally, it is not my taste in scents but I think it is a mass appealing scent because I have got a decent amounts of compliments from my friends. My girlfriend likes it and compliments me often, when I wear it she keeps sniffing around in the gaps of an hour (i love that :p). It projects decent enough so that people around me can notice and the longevity is for like 6-8 hours for me. **Scent Profile: 8/10** **Projection: 7/10** **Longevity: 8/10** # Hawas Ice: This perfume is a BEAST. The initial sprays of this are very strong, it fills the room very quickly. The prominent top note for this MINT with hints of citrus, you can smell the top notes for about an hour and then the middle notes start opening up where I smell the plum very much (I dont like plum smell) and the smell reminds me of boomer chewing gum (in a good way) and lastly the base notes are muskyish which I like. The scent projects very loudly and the longevity is very very good on this for about 10-12 hours, I spray this before college and smell it till the evening. Personally, I am not fond of the scent profile and if you are curious about compliment factor, I did not get one from this. **Scent Profile: 5/10 (for you, it might be better)** **Projection: 9/10** **Longevity: 9.5/10** # Davidoff Coolwater: Wish it lasted more :( Before anything, I love this perfume. Initial profile is very good with flowers like lavenders (my fav one) and hints of mint and watery notes, the most lovable profile of this perfume for me is the middle note, it has amazingly pleasing scent that smells like bubblegum which I fell in love with surprisingly. The base notes are again muskyish with a hint of tobacco. The projection is okaish but the longevity is trash (3-4 hours with projection for 1-2 hours) and I wish it could last longer. **Scent Profile: 9.5/10** **Projection: 5/10** **Longevity: 2/10** # Afnan 9PM: My girlfriend loves this, she keeps sniffing it. One of the best perfumes I have tried, its perfect for winters and if you're in an AC environment for a date, it performs GREAT there too. The initial notes are cinnamon prominent with the hints of apple and some flowers and in the dry down the vanilla with amber takes over everything which is just very pleasing. To some the top notes MIGHT smell boozy (because my roommate does). The projection is incredible and the longevity is eternal for me (12-14 hours). I mostly use this for my dates and end up smelling the lingering scent over my skin. Also my most complimented perfume so far, may it be males or females I have gathered compliments from every one of them. PS: I love every note of this perfume and one of my favorites so far. **Scent Profile: 10/10** **Projection: 9/10** **Longevity: 10/10** # Asad: The top notes are tobacco and spice (I hate both of them) which are harsh initially after maybe 10 minutes they are endurable and I forgot the middle note but I liked the base notes to some extent. It projects very well and is eternal lasting. I am sure this is a winter perfume...."

n1bv35d,2025-07-04 16:21:22,en,REDDIT,"  Julio Savi's 'Towards the Summit of Reality: An Introduction to the Study of Baha'u'llah's Seven Valleys and Four Valleys' gives some background on the Seven Sleepers of Ephesus on pages 198-203: >Seven Christian youth are mentioned in an ancient Christian Syriac legend related by James of Sarugh, a Monophysite bishop of the 5th century. The legend says that during cruel persecutions by the Roman Emperor Decius (248-251) seven Christian Ephesian youth took refuge in a cave, in order to avoid sacrificing to the pagan idols. They fell asleep and woke up 196 years later during the reign of the Emperor Theodosius (347-395). The persecutions of the Christians had ended and Christianity was an established religion, but the seven youth thought they had slept for just one day. (p. 198) Savi also provides background on the mystical meaning of sleep, the association of the word 'youth (fitya)' with chivalry, references to the Seven Sleepers in Rumi, and symbolic meanings of right and left. Two entries in the Partial Inventory have 'Companions of the Cave' in their first lines: AB03341 and ABU1615. The entry for AB03341 is: >AB03341. 340 words, mixed. ای بنده الهی نامه مشک ی واصل و بر مضا م ی اطلاع حاصل >شد تا بحال خ ی مداومت... در خصوص اصحاب کهف سؤال نموده بوديد O servant of God! >The musk-scented letter was received and its contents were noted. Until now, news of steadfastness... As to what thou didst ask concerning the Companions of the Cave [3.5s]... Mss: [INBA85:007](https://afnanlibrary.org/d/inba_v085/?page=9). Pubs: [MMK6#280x](https://bahai-library.com/bahailib/1699.pdf#page=206). Trans: None. Subjects: stories; anecdotes, spiritual meetings; gatherings; devotional gatherings; feasts, interpretation of words and passages in scripture, teaching the Cause; call to teach, detachment; severance; renunciation; patience. AB03341 is from Majmú`ih-yi Makátíb, and in manuscript in the Iranian National Baha'i Archives, vol 85, on the Afnan library. A text file which hasn't been proofread is available for this volume, and their website cautions that this isn't suitable for reading but is useful for searches. I used ChatGPT to translate a part of this tablet where 'Abdu'l-Baha provides an interpretation of the Companions of the Cave. Posting this translation was apparently contrary to the AI content rules of the subreddit, so my original comment was removed by the moderators. I understand the reasons for this, but those interested can attempt the translation themselves, or perhaps a Persian speaker can provide their provisional translation of the relevant section.

1ltixfd,2025-07-07 02:34:08,en,REDDIT,"  Bought a travel size decant of Creed SMW, absolutely loved it, but the price tag of the actual bottle brought me to research some dupes to see if I could at least get ""near"" the scent profile. After lurking hundreds of reviews, CDN - Sillage (vs) Afnan Supremacy In Heaven were the top contenders. In a nutshell, it was described as Musky dupe (vs) Citrusy dupe. I played it safe with citrusy. On to the review! THE PROS-- The best way to describe Supremacy In Heaven is if D&G Light Blue and Creed SMW had a baby. Very fresh, bright, a touch of green leaves, and heavy on the citrus oils. Smells like walking through a citrus grove, wet green leaves, and light green tea. On the dry down you get a little bit more of the woodsy notes coming through, but the citrus is still front and center. Performance is medium, but then again so is SMW so wasn't too worried here. Another big selling point was the bottle design, the blue to chrome fade and the halo top I am proud to display, beautiful. I would consider Supremacy In Heaven in the ""safe"" freshie blind buy territory as it really does not have any offensive/musky element to it, you just have to like citrus. Price was about $27 on Amazon. THE CONS-- The biggest note that SIH is lacking is that wet river rock ""pertichor-ish"" type scent. SMW just nails that minerality and morning dew covered hiking trail scent that SIH is lacking in its profile. This one was hard for me to give up as it is that exact profile that drew me to SMW in the first place. The citrus can be overpowering to some people that are expecting the smooth/balanced opening of SMW. THE VERDICT-- How close is it to SMW? 85% It's a close one! If they toned down the citrus note and upped the petrichor/minerality - it would be a perfect match. What would I rate it on its own? 8.5/10 I love citrus freshies so this one ranks fairly well with me, it truly does feel like walking through a citrus grove in the morning. For it to hit that mood and vibe so well at $27 is just insanely worth it IMHO. Thanks for reading everyone!"

1lty23e,2025-07-07 16:03:21,en,REDDIT,"  Hey frag fam, 24M from Delhi here. I've been into fragrances for a while now, but most of what I know today is thanks to this amazing community. Whether it was going down rabbit holes on old threads or reading all the reviews and recommendations, I've learned so much — and I genuinely want to thank all the fellow fragheads here for helping me become a more cognoscenti person in this world of scent. I started out with just 2–3 designer bottles, and looking back now, I'm genuinely proud of how far I've come. From blindly wearing basic stuff to now appreciating note breakdowns, flankers, seasonal wear — it's been a fun and nerdy ride I used ChatGPT to help organize this post, but all opinions are mine. Here's my current designer starter pack – 15 fragrances, quick thoughts, and ratings: 1. YSL Y EDP – My all-time favourite. Clean, fresh, sweet, gets compliments without even trying. 10/10 2. 1 Million Lucky – Hazelnut and plum combo that's just addictive. Discontinued and that hurts. 9/10 3. Acqua Di Giò Profumo – Classy AF. Smells like a CEO went for a walk by the sea. 9/10 4. YSL MYSLF – At first I was like meh… but it grew on me. Fresh, musky, different. 8.5/10 5. Dior Homme Sport 2021 – Ginger kick with a clean drydown. Very easy to wear. 8.5/10 6. Armani Code Parfum – Softer, modern version of the OG. Perfect for close settings. 8.5/10 7. Acqua Di Giò Parfum (2024) – The newest one, and honestly pretty good. Fresh with depth. 8/10 8. 1 Million EDT – Loud, sweet, and still works when I want to stand out. Club or winter frag. 8/10 9. Terre d'Hermès EDT – Smells like grown-man confidence. Dirty orange + vetiver vibe. 8/10 10. Versace Dylan Blue – My safe pick when I don't know what to wear. Just works. 8/10 11. Afnan SNOI – Aventus vibes with darker, fruitier twist...."

mov_5272E4D217382E0A331C3E8438EB12F6,2025-07-12 04:03:55,en,WEB,"  Cooking with love: Afnan's TikTok journey is a mix of tradition and modernity Lakshana N Palat, Assistant Features Editor 4 MIN READ Afnan, known as @AfnanRecipes on TikTok, shares how her everyday moments turned into content millions love. She wasn't trying to chase views or go viral. She was just doing what she loved best, cooking with her daughter, and casually recording it. For Dubai-based mum Afnan, it was about capturing joy in the purest form, family, food and laughter. “I've always loved cooking for my family, and every dish came with a story. What really pushed me to start was my daughter, Mouna. We used to cook together and laugh so naturally, so I thought, why not share these moments on TikTok? I never imagined it would grow this big, but people really connected with the family vibe and the real, relatable energy,” she explains. Perhaps, it's this raw authenticity that builds Afnan's loyal following. She doesn't show her face in her TikTok videos, but her presence is unmistakable. Each video carries her voice, warmth, and intention, serving not just recipes, but slices of home and parenting moments that resonate far beyond the screen. You can feel the two of them having a blast. Also Read: A Dubai mum's rescue mission for abandoned animals—and the son who made it unforgettable: 'We fostered 8 dogs once' Creativity starts in the fridge and comments Afnan doesn't plan her recipes. And, perhaps that spontaneity is her secret ingredient in the kitchen. “I get inspired by everything around me, what my kids ask for, dishes I try at restaurants, TikTok trends, and even my followers' comments. Sometimes a recipe starts with one simple ingredient I have at home, and I keep building on it until it becomes something fun, new, and easy.” That spontaneous, what's-in-the-fridge approach resonates with her audience, especially fellow busy parents looking for ideas that are practical yet flavourful. Her signature style She loves blending traditional Arabic flavours with modern, easy techniques. “I like taking classic recipes and simplifying them for today's busy moms. It's a way to stay connected to our roots while keeping up with modern tastes,” she says. This gentle balance of heritage and ease brings a sense of accessibility, and is also emotionally satisfying, comfort food that feels both familiar and fresh. Why her lunchbox recipes went viral One of her most viral moments was a video featuring her daughter's lunch. “My lunchbox recipe for my daughter went viral. The story was real, the setup was simple, and every mom related to it. The success wasn't in the filming, it was in the emotion and connection.” That video catapulted her into the spotlight, but Afnan remained grounded in the very thing that brought her there, relatability."
