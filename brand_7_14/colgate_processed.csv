mov_44E0A751A74D0197A5F8426FAC586C23,2025-06-16 18:31:40,en,WEB,"  The University of California, San Francisco (UCSF) has received a $5 million donation from the Jean Pierre “JP” Conte Family Foundation to support neurology research focused on Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions. The gift, made in November 2024, will endow two professorships within the Department of Neurology. The professorships will be overseen by Dr. S. Andrew Josephson, chair of the UCSF Department of Neurology, and are intended to advance faculty-led research at UCSF's Weill Institute for Neurosciences, one of the nation's leading centers for brain health research. The professorships funded by Conte's gift are expected to help advance understanding and the treatment of Parkinson's disease and related disorders. By supporting the work of leading researchers within the Department of Neurology and the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences, the donation aims to contribute to breakthrough discoveries that could improve diagnosis, treatment, and potentially prevention of these conditions. UCSF Work with Neurological Disorders Neurological disorders represent some of the most complex challenges in medicine today. Parkinson's disease, which affects millions worldwide, progressively damages the nervous system, causing tremors, stiffness, and difficulty with balance and coordination. Despite decades of research, many aspects of the disease remain poorly understood, and current treatments address symptoms rather than underlying causes. UCSF has been widely recognized for its contributions to understanding and treating neurological disorders, including Parkinson's disease, a progressive condition affecting millions globally. The new positions are expected to support long-term research into the causes, progression, and treatment of such conditions. ""UCSF is an incredible place,"" Conte stated when discussing his decision to support the institution. UCSF's premier status in medical research further underscored his choice to direct his philanthropy toward the university's neuroscience programs. Strategic Philanthropy Inspired by Personal Experience The gift aligns with UCSF's standing as a leader in brain health research. As one of the world's premier medical research institutions, the UCSF Weill Institute for Neurosciences has established itself as a hub for groundbreaking research in understanding and treating neurological conditions. Conte's donation will further strengthen this position by adding faculty positions dedicated to advancing knowledge in the field. The gift was made in memory of Conte's father, Pierre Conte, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's disease in his 70s and passed away in 2017, and underscores Conte's strategic approach to philanthropy. Following this experience, the Conte family directed increased attention to supporting neurological research through their foundation, established that same year. The foundation's support for UCSF reflects its efforts to back organizations tackling complex health challenges with strong institutional leadership and research capacity. The professorships aim to sustain long-term investigations into Parkinson's and related disorders by providing stable support for clinician-scientists dedicated to this field. JP Conte's Background in Philanthropy Jean-Pierre “JP” Conte is an American business executive and investor with more than three decades of experience in private equity. He launched Lupine Crest Capital, a family office established in 2025, and is recognized for his support of causes in healthcare, education, and public art. His philanthropic efforts are deeply rooted in his heritage, particularly in his parents, who are both immigrants. Conte received his undergraduate degree from Colgate University in 1985 and earned an MBA from Harvard Business School in 1989. He began his finance career at a bank in New York City before transitioning into the private equity field shortly thereafter, quickly advancing to various leadership positions. Throughout his career, Conte has maintained a ""family-first"" management approach that emphasizes collaborative culture and a focus on building teams of top specialists to transform companies into industry leaders. This people-centered philosophy extends to his philanthropic efforts, which focus on making targeted investments in organizations and initiatives with the potential for significant positive impact. Past philanthropic contributions include support for the Bay Lights public art project in San Francisco and Sponsors for Educational Opportunity. The UCSF donation represents one of the most extensive neuroscience-related contributions made by the JP Conte Family Foundation to date. Strategic Investment in Scientific Excellence To Conte, the generous donation represents a strategic approach to philanthropy that reflects his business acumen. He explains, “Investing in UCSF means empowering the best-equipped players to tackle the most complex problems in health.” Philanthropy History The $5 million gift to UCSF continues Conte's established pattern of significant philanthropic contributions. In addition to his neuroscience funding, he has supported a range of impactful community projects. In 2015, he was among the lead donors to ""The Bay Lights,"" an $8 million public art installation that permanently illuminated the San Francisco–Oakland Bay Bridge. And, for many years, he has backed Sponsors for Educational Opportunity, a non-profit that supports students on the path to being a first-generation college graduate. By diversifying his philanthropy across healthcare, science, art, and education, Conte demonstrates a comprehensive approach to giving that addresses both immediate needs and long-term challenges. However, his shift toward funding neuroscience research after his father's illness shows how personal experience has shaped his philanthropic priorities. Financial Market Success The second-generation American achieved tremendous success in the financial market by applying the work ethic he learned from his father's work at a clothing store in New York. He is not afraid to learn from his mistakes and pass these lessons on to others, which he attributes to his business acumen. His work culminated in his ability to donate to UCSF for a cause dear to his heart. Conte's story is one of humble beginnings and hard work, leading to charitable causes and an established history of philanthropy."

52416986c899c2636af94cb6372755b8,2025-06-17 02:47:00,en,WEB,"  India's booming OTT market is undergoing a clear shift in viewer behavior. Once riding high on a surge in paid subscriptions, the industry is now seeing a return to its roots: free, ad-supported content. As more consumers balk at rising subscription costs, hybrid and AVOD (Advertising Video on Demand) models are gaining traction—particularly in Tier 2 and 3 cities where affordability shapes viewing choices. “Subscription fatigue is real, especially in a market like India where value drives decisions,” says Prashant Puri, CEO & Co-Founder of AdLift. “The hybrid model—ads plus subscription—is emerging as the sweet spot, offering affordability without compromising on content quality.” India's digital advertising market is thriving. According to Dentsu India, digital ad spends are projected to cross Rs 59,200 crore by 2025. OTT platforms are primed to capture a large chunk of this pie, especially as user acquisition slows down in the SVOD space. “Platforms like YouTube and JioStar have normalized ad exposure even within premium content,” says Raj Swaminathan, Sr. Director at Globale Media. “For platforms, this means scaling reach without alienating users.” As per Ormax's OTT Report released last year, India's digital video audience universe stands at 547.3 million, of which 28% are SVOD audiences while the remaining (72%) are AVOD audiences. The SVOD audience base has shown a 2% decline, dropping from 153.0 million in 2023 to 150.6 million in 2024. While platforms like Netflix and Amazon Prime have carved out a premium subscriber base, much of the mass market remains price-sensitive, experts say SVOD penetration remains lower compared to Western markets. Even premium platforms are now experimenting with ad-supported tiers to reach wider audiences. The result is a more nuanced streaming model—offering users a choice between completely free content with ads, low-cost plans with limited ads, and premium ad-free experiences. “In Tier 2 and Tier 3 markets, people don't want to pay Rs 200 a month just to skip ads,” says a media planner, adding, ""but they'll watch ads if the content is regional, fresh, and culturally relevant.” This trade-off—time for value—is something Indian audiences are uniquely comfortable with. Dhurvin Shah, CEO of JOJO, underscores this. “India has long embraced ad-supported content. Viewers either pay with time or money, depending on the experience. For us, AVOD helped us build a base of over 65 lakh users.” The Shift Is Structural, Not Temporary While the COVID-19 years saw an unprecedented spike in paid OTT subscriptions, the post-pandemic economy is recalibrating consumption habits. Inflation, app overload, and content fatigue are forcing consumers to consolidate where they spend—and platforms are taking note, say experts. “Indian consumers were ambushed by choice,” says Sadamate. “Now they want flexibility, relevance, and consistency. That's where AVOD wins.” Even Amazon Prime Video's recent move to introduce ads in India underscores this evolution. With its deep e-commerce integration and massive reach, Amazon could become the poster child for a content-to-commerce ecosystem that marries AVOD efficiency with transactional convenience. The Path Forward: Personalization and Control Ad tolerance may be high, but relevance is key. As Sukhpreet Singh, CRO of Dish TV, points out: “Seamless, intelligent ad integration will be the differentiator. The goal is to make advertising feel less like an interruption and more like part of the viewing experience.” That means more targeted ads, smarter frequency caps, and increased personalization based on user behavior and geography. “India isn't just ready for AVOD—it's leading the way,” says Siddharth Devani, Co-Founder of SoCheers. “Unlike the West, where ad resistance is high, India's digital ecosystem thrives on flexibility. Platforms that understand this duality—free and premium, urban and rural, ad-tolerant and ad-free—will be the ones to win.” This isn't a death knell for SVOD, but rather a moment of realignment, sums up experts. The high-ARPU, low-churn subscribers will remain loyal—but they're now the exception, not the norm, believe experts. To scale sustainably, OTT platforms in India must blend premium storytelling with accessible monetization models. In a country where 32% of total media revenue now comes from digital, the future of OTT lies in diversity not just of content, but of pricing, access, and ad experiences. As India eyes global leadership in media, entertainment and gaming, Storyboard18's Digital Entertainment Summit, set to take place on June 27 in the capital, will spotlight the bold strategies, policy pathways and creative innovations shaping the future of the industry. From the chiefs of Nestle, Diageo, Colgate, PepsiCo, Zetwerk and CRED to AI visionaries, marketing mavens, top creators, ad legends and leading global agencies' CEOs, the brightest minds converged at the Storyboard18 Global Pioneers Summit for an action-packed day of meaningful dialogues on creativity, commerce and culture."

Aquí te mostramos recomendaciones de protección al consumidor y en el apartado de la ciberseguridad: Compra siempre desde la web oficial de Amazon Evita acceder a Amazon a través de enlaces de correos electrónicos o mensajes sospechosos. Es preferible escribir directamente la dirección de la tienda online en el navegador para evitar sitios fraudulentos que imitan la apariencia de Amazon. Verifica la autenticidad de las ofertas Desconfía de descuentos excesivos o productos que parecen demasiado baratos para ser ciertos. Consulta el historial de precios con herramientas como CamelCamelCamel para asegurarte de que realmente se trata de una oferta y no de una subida previa de precio antes del descuento. Revisa las valoraciones y opiniones de otros compradores Antes de realizar una compra, lee las reseñas y valoraciones de otros usuarios. Presta atención a los comentarios negativos y a las valoraciones verificadas. Si un producto tiene pocas opiniones o todas son excesivamente positivas y recientes, podría tratarse de reseñas falsas. Protege tus datos personales y bancarios Utiliza contraseñas seguras y no compartas tus datos personales ni bancarios fuera de la plataforma oficial de Amazon. Habilita la verificación en dos pasos para añadir una capa extra de seguridad a tu cuenta. Comprueba el vendedor Amazon vende productos directamente, pero también permite a terceros vender en su plataforma. Verifica la reputación del vendedor, su antigüedad y las valoraciones recibidas. Si tienes dudas, prioriza productos vendidos y gestionados por Amazon.

mov_BBE951EF401FB09984C310034F889548,2025-06-17 17:03:38,fr,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[fr]Le tournoi     Créée en 1955, cette épreuve se nommait le LPGA Championship avant de connaître diverses appellations en raison des partenaires financiers qui ont attaché leur image à ce tournoi. En 2015, L'association des golfeurs professionnels américains (PGA) introduit cette épreuve à son calendrier et fait disparaître le nom de l'association LPGA, à son profit. C'est aussi l'opportunité, pour le LPGA Tour, de mieux promouvoir ce tournoi et le golf féminin. Il s'agit de la 71e édition de ce tournoi. Ce majeur accueille également des pro enseignantes de la PGA, en partenariat avec l'équipe de la société Corebridge Financial. Elles sont dix à participer de cette opportunité. Le champ de joueuses     Elles étaient 155 l'an dernier et sont 156 cette année pour quatre jours de tournoi avec un Cut, après deux tours, qui conservera les 70 meilleures et ex æquo. Ce champ est composé, comme pour tous les tournois majeurs, du Top 80 de la Race, agrémenté de plusieurs catégories, dont celle des anciennes vainqueurs de majeur et celle des vainqueurs de tournois. Aussi, retrouvons-nous Lydia Ko, Nelly Korda, Céline Boutier, Ayaka Furue, Maja Stark, Jennifer Kupcho, Yuka Saso, Allisen Corpuz, Minjee Lee ou encore A Lim Kim, Lilia et Mao Saigo. Mais aussi Rose Zhang, Leona Maguire, Alexa Pano, Chenette Wannasaen, Megan Khang, Hae Ran Ryu, Bailey Tardy, Atthaya « Jeeno » Thitikul, Linnea Strom Chisato Iwai et Carlota Ciganda, bien entendu. Se joignent à ce champ des joueuses non membres comme la Suissesse du LET Chiara Tamburlini, ainsi que l'Anglaise Mimi Rhodes, qui bénéficie d'une invitation sponsor, au même titre de Stacy Lewis. Et l'Américaine n'est pas la seule ancienne gloire du circuit à participer à ce tournoi, puisque Cristie Kerr est également présente. Enfin, ce champ est complété par 10 joueuses enseignantes, dont certaines ont évolué sur l'Epson Tour ou le LPGA Tour. Côté Français, en plus de Céline Boutier, on note la présence de Pauline Roussin-Bouchard. Le champ de joueuses en détail => ICI    Les rookie dans le champ        Les pro enseignantes du team Corebridge Financial        Les invitées sponsors     Mimi Rhodes – Angleterre    Stacy Lewis – USA     Les anciennes lauréates du tournoi dans le champ        Les joueuses qui jouent leur premier KPMG Women's PGA Championship     Elles sont 28 cette semaine à faire leur début dans ce tournoi majeur qui a célébré une première victoire en carrière pour des joueuses comme Hannah Green et Danielle Kang. Les douze derniers vainqueurs     2024 : Amy Yang    2023 : Ruoning Yin    2022 : In Gee Chun    2021 : Nelly Korda    2020 : Sei Young Kim    2019 : Hannah Green    2018 : Sung Hyun Park    2017 : Danielle Kang    2016 : Brooke M.Henderson    2015 : Inbee Park    2014 : Inbee Park    2013 : Inbee Park     Les multiples vainqueurs     39 joueuses différentes ont remporté cette épreuve. Trois nous ont quitté en la personne de Louise Suggs, Mickey Wright et Kathy Ahern. 14 joueuses sont multiples vainqueurs dont voici les noms :     Mickey Wright : 1958 – 1960 – 1961 – 1963    Kathy Whitworth : 1967 – 1971 – 1975    Nancy Lopez : 1978 – 1985 – 1989    Patty Sheehan : 1983 – 1984 – 1993    Annika Sorenstam : 2003 – 2004 – 2005    Se Ri Pak : 1998 – 2002 – 2006    Inbee Park : 2013 – 2014 – 2015    Betsy Rawls : 1959 – 1969    Mary Mills : 1964 – 1973    Sandra Haynie : 1965 – 1974    Donna Caponi : 1979 – 1981    Laura Davies : 1994 – 1996    Juli Inkster : 1999 – 2000    Yani Tseng : 2008 – 2011      Seules Inbee Park et Annika Sorenstam ont remporté l'épreuve 3 années de suite. Le parcours     Direction le Texas, cette semaine, état où sont basées de nombreuses joueuses du LPGA Tour, et notamment Céline Boutier. Le parcours est celui du PGA Frisco, au nord et à 45 minutes de la ville de Dallas. Le tracé date de 2023 et s'inscrit dans un complexe type centre de performance dédié au golf, niché dans une zone en cours d'urbanisation. Conçu par l'architecte Gil Hanse, le Fields Ranch se caractérise par de larges green, de nombreux bunker et plusieurs pièces d'eau, potentiellement asséchées cette semaine. Un cours d'eau serpente cependant entre les trous 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 17 et 18. La conception du parcours est un subtil mélange entre links et parcours modernes à l'américaine, avec des rough laissés à l'état sauvage, des bunker de sable blanc, de différentes profondeurs, et des fairway ondulés parfois étroits. Les green comportent de nombreuses pentes, et comme à l'US Women's Open, il est fort possible que nous assistions à des moments périlleux qui devraient occasionner bogey et double bogey. Les joueuses qui auront apprécié le parcours dans l'Utah devraient facilement y prendre leurs repères. Plusieurs trous réservent des moments de bravoure, dont le 18, dont le fairway est scindé, à deux endroits, par le cours d'eau, et le green qui se termine, à droite, par un profond fossé. Quant à la graminée, c'est de la bermudagrass qui est majoritairement plantée, y compris dans les rough. La vidéo de chaque trou     https://www.youtube.com/watch? v=2AXTqc8g6yY     Prime et dotation     L'entreprise KPMG est spécialisée dans l'audit en entreprise et propose des services telles les expertises comptables. Elle est investie dans le golf depuis plusieurs années et son arrivée sur ce tournoi majeur a permis de faire considérablement évoluer la dotation. En 1955 la prime totale était fixée à 6000 dollars dont 1200 pour la vainqueur. Le début des années 70, avec les revendications des groupes de joueuses de tennis et l'avènement du Colgate Dinah Shore Circle, a permis de faire évoluer les primes entre les hommes et les femmes, si bien que le PGA Women's Championship a franchi le cap des 50 000 dollars de prime en moins de 20 ans. Grâce à KPMG, le PGA Women's Championship a été doté d'une prime de 3,5 millions en 2015 dont 525 000 au vainqueur. En 2018, la prime totale fut portée à 3,65 millions de dollars et elle connut, en 2022, une sensible augmentation, passant de 4,3 millions de dollars, en 2020, à 4,5 millions. En 2023, pour la 69ème édition, c'est une dotation exceptionnelle qui fut accordée avec 9 millions de dollars. Faisant du KPMG Women's PGA Championship, le second majeur le mieux doté de la saison après l'US Women's Open. En 2024, la dotation évoluait encore pour passer à 10 millions de dollars. Cette année, cette dotation évolue encore avec 400 000 dollars supplémentaires. Anecdotes     La première épreuve fut disputée en matchplay. C'est seulement en 1956 que l'épreuve se déroula en stroke-play     Le LPGA Championship connut 12 playoff. Le premier eut lieu en 1956. En 2018, un playoff opposa So Yeon Ryu, Nasa Hataoka et Sung Hyun Park après une égalité sur le score de –10. Sung Hyun Park l'emporta au terme de deux trous de playoff qui connut une interruption en raison de la pluie. Le PGA Championship n'est pas reconnu comme épreuve Majeur par le Ladies European Tour     En 2017, Axel Bettan officiait comme caddie de I.K Kim. De même, Klara Spilkova et Georgia Hall étaient les deux joueuses du L.E.T à bénéficier d'une exemption. En 2020, la joueuse sud-coréenne, Sei Young Kim, signait une carte de 63, lors du dernier tour, ce qui n'était jamais arrivé dans cette épreuve. Quatre joueuses se partagent le record du tournoi, fixé à –19. Il s'agit de Yani Tseng, de Cristie Kerr, de Inbee Park, et depuis 2021, de Nelly Korda. Cependant, la LPGA considère Sei Young Kim comme la joueuse ayant réalisé le score le plus bas, en 2020, soit 266. Mais le parcours, cette année-là, était un Par 70."

myg54u8,2025-06-18 13:47:16,en,REDDIT,"  As a newcomer to the franchise, the only part of the story I liked was the Colgate focused section, since they had to actually put all of the relevant information in this game for that, being that she is a new character and all. The rest has been a lot of yapping without anything useful actually being said. I liked Aphelion too, as they once again put everything I needed to know in the story. I've just given up and started skipping the story for the rest of the events, they aren't worth my time to read. Lore is so terribly presented in this game that I know essentially none of it, despite playing since launch, so I'd give this part a very low score. The characters are mostly great, and are pretty much the only reason I'm still playing. That and the gameplay is pretty good, although the end game grind is kinda boring. Gunsmoke is the most boring way to do a boss fight I've ever seen in a videogame. I haven't looked into any of MICA's other stuff, since the poor way the story is handled in this game doesn't inspire me to look for more. I'm happy to continue playing this for now, as it's a pretty low maintenance gacha game, all things considered, but I have little desire to try anything else by them."

Μέσα σε ένα διάστημα 15 χρόνων (1991-2006), η Reis ζητούσε από τις εταιρείες αυτές να της πουλήσουν προϊόντα (π.χ. φορτηγά ολόκληρα γεμάτα καλλυντικά ή αναψυκτικά) σε εξαιρετικά χαμηλή τιμή, τα οποία υποτίθεται πως προορίζονταν για διαφημιστικές καμπάνιες. Επιπλέον, μέσα από την εταιρεία – «μαϊμού» που είχε ιδρύσει, έταζε στις εταιρείες αποκλειστική διάθεση των προϊόντων τους σε καταστήματα με μεγάλη πελατεία. ΔΙΑΒΑΣΤΕ ΕΠΙΣΗΣ Στην πραγματικότητα, η Reis δεν πραγματοποιούσε καμιά από τις υποσχέσεις της, παρά μεταπωλούσε τα προϊόντα που της είχαν δώσει οι εταιρείες, αποκομίζοντας μεγάλα κέρδη για την ίδια – συνολικά, εκτιμάται ότι έκλεψε πάνω από 80 εκατομμύρια δολάρια!  Το 2013, καταδικάστηκε σε φυλάκιση 19 μηνών και πλήρωσε πρόστιμα και αποζημιώσεις ύψους 6,7 εκατομμυρίων δολαρίων. Justin David May (και 16χρονος) Ο 31χρονος May από το Ντέλαγουερ των ΗΠΑ έθεσε στο στόχαστρό του μεγάλες εταιρείες τεχνολογίας όπως η Cisco, η Microsoft, η Lenovo και η APC. Για τρία χρόνια (2016-2019) ο άνδρας υποκρινόταν τον εταιρικό πελάτη, πλαστογραφώντας διευθύνσεις e-mail υπαρκτών εταιρειών, και έπειτα ζητούσε από τους τεχνολογικούς «κολοσσούς» να του αντικαταστήσουν υποτιθέμενες… ελαττωματικές συσκευές, προσκομίζοντας πλαστές αιτήσεις εγγύησης. Ο May κατάφερε να λάβει εκατοντάδες νέες συσκευές εντελώς δωρεάν, τις οποίες και μεταπωλούσε. Στην περίπτωση της Microsoft, μάλιστα, συνεργάστηκε και με έναν…δεκαεξάχρονο, καταφέρνοντας μαζί να αποσπάσουν 56 λάπτοπ αξίας περίπου 195.000 δολαρίων. Η συνολική «μπάζα» του May έφτασε τα 3,5 εκατομμύρια δολάρια. Ο άνδρας καταδικάστηκε σε φυλάκιση σχεδόν πέντε ετών το 2022 και πλήρωσε αποζημίωση περίπου 1,9 δολαρίων. Volodymyr Kvashuk Ο Ουκρανός μηχανικός Volodymyr Kvashuk στόχευσε επίσης την Microsoft, αλλά «εκ των έσω», καθώς εργαζόταν σε αυτήν όταν έστησε την πλεκτάνη του με πλαστές δωροκάρτες. Ο Kvashuk χρησιμοποιούσε το σύστημα της ίδιας της εταιρείας για να κατασκευάζει τις κάρτες αυτές, τις οποίες είτε εξαργύρωνε ο ίδιος, είτε πωλούσε σε τρίτους στο διαδίκτυο. Συνολικά, αποκόμισε 10 εκατομμύρια δολάρια, με τα οποία πρόλαβε να αγοράσει ένα πολυτελές αυτοκίνητο και σπίτι. Συνελήφθη το 2019 και το 2020 καταδικάστηκε σε 9 χρόνια φυλάκισης. Οι απατεώνες του…πενταγράμμου Τρεις άνδρες από τη Βρετανία δημιούργησαν στα…πρόχειρα μία σειρά από τραγούδια, τα οποία στην συνέχεια ανέβηκαν σε πλατφόρμες streaming όπως το Spotify, το iTunes και το Amazon Music. Έπειτα, αγόραζαν τα συγκεκριμένα κομμάτια ή συνδρομές στις πλατφόρμες με κλεμμένες ή πλαστές πιστωτικές κάρτες, αποκομίζοντας περίπου ένα εκατομμύριο λίρες από τα…δικαιώματα των κομματιών. Έδρασαν για περίπου ένα έτος, από το 2018 έως το 2019 ώσπου τελικά συνελήφθησαν και καταδικάστηκαν όλοι σε φυλάκιση 3-5 ετών. Evaldas Rimasauskas, ο… πειρατής του ίντερνετ Μία από τις πιο εντυπωσιακές περιπτώσεις…απατεώνα είναι αυτή του Λιθουανού Evaldas Rimasauskas, ο οποίος απέσπασε περί τα 122 εκατομμύρια δολάρια από τη Facebook και τη Google. Ο τρόπος που διέπραξε το έγκλημά του ήταν ο εξής: Ο Rimasauskas γνώριζε ότι οι συγκεκριμένες εταιρείες προμηθεύονταν hardware (π.χ. ρούτερ κτλ) από μία άλλη εταιρεία με έδρα την Ταϊβάν, ονόματι Quanta. Έτσι, λοιπόν, δημιούργησε μία ψεύτικη εταιρεία – «καθρέφτη» της Quanta, με έδρα την Λετονία και την Κύπρο. Έπειτα, ξεκίνησε να στέλνει στην Google και την Facebook τιμολόγια για προϊόντα που υποτίθεται πως είχαν αγοράσει από την Quanta, τα οποία οι εταιρείες πλήρωναν χωρίς να το…πολυσκεφτούν. Τα χρήματα κατέληγαν, φυσικά, σε λογαριασμούς όπου είχε πρόσβαση ο ίδιος ο Rimasauskas. Φαίνεται ότι ο άνδρας θα μπορούσε να συνεχίσει να κλέβει τα χρήματα επ' αόριστον, αλλά τελικά, κάποιος στην Google αντιλήφθηκε την απάτη και ενημέρωσε τις αρχές. Αφού εντόπισαν τις πληρωμές, κατάφεραν να εντοπίσουν και τον δράστη, ο οποίος συνελήφθη από τις λετονικές αρχές το 2017 και εκδόθηκε στη Νέα Υόρκη για να αντιμετωπίσει τη δικαιοσύνη. Ο Rimasauskas κατηγορήθηκε για απάτη μέσω ηλεκτρονικών συναλλαγών, ένα έγκλημα που επισύρει μέγιστη ποινή 30 ετών. Τελικά, αναγκάστηκε να επιστρέψει 49,7 εκατομμύρια δολάρια και καταδικάστηκε σε 5 χρόνια φυλάκισης. Ωστόσο, περίπου 50 εκατομμύρια δολάρια παραμένουν αγνοούμενα. Γνωρίζοντας το… ταλέντο του Rimasauskas στο ξέπλυμα χρήματος, οι αρχές υποθέτουν ότι πιθανότατα είναι κρυμμένα σε μια σειρά τραπεζών παρόμοιες με εκείνες που χρησιμοποίησε για να ξεπλύνει τα χρήματα εξαρχής."

Also there's no such defence systems exists in current world which has 100% accuracy, if you are throwing a thousand missiles there's a great probability that  a dozen may not be intercepted. The whole purpose of Air defence systems is to minimize your own casualities and achieving your operational goals. Sad part is here in india we have part time youtube defence analyst like you and a mass ignorant people who think that there's no cost of war, thats not how it works.

39108681_4061,2025-06-22 21:00:00,en,WORDPRESS,"  The Holy Grail for business start-ups and mature organizations alike is customer procurement. Winning customers at a sufficient pace is critical to the survival of every company and especially for those at the fledgling stage. And yet I cannot tell you how many times I have seen entrepreneurs focus more on other aspects of their business rather than making sure they have enough customers to keep the doors open. There is no doubt that we must have a minimally viable product that our customers want to buy. And implementing a wide variety of systems and processes is also an important factor. But without the customers, everything else is moot. To find the customers and convince them to spend their money with us requires pulling out all the stops. Top notch interactive websites, regular informational blogs, referral programs, social media, drip marketing, multi-media advertising and positive publicity are building blocks toward customer procurement. Yet, even with full implementation, the customers may not come in numbers or as quickly as are needed. What to do? Go back to the basics and fundamentals. Think back to prom night – what was happening? Girls had their hair done. Guys were renting tuxedos. Corsages and boutonnieres were purchased; makeup was applied, and shoes were shined to a fine gloss. In other words, we were all trying to look our very best. Think about this with respect to our products or services. <strong><u>Have we done everything possible to look fantastic to those outside our company? </u></strong> Do prospective customers clearly understand our value proposition? How strongly are we able to demonstrate that our product or service solves a problem and preferably one with which a lot of pain is associated? This is a major failure for a vast number of companies. Their product/service might be nice to have, but the customer cannot find a compelling reason to purchase it. Think of Colgate Kitchen Entrees. Never heard of this? You are not alone. The folks that make Colgate toothpaste thought it might be a good idea to launch a line of frozen dinners. Customers could eat a Colgate meal and then use Colgate toothpaste to brush their teeth. What kind of value proposition is that?! <strong><u>If we can't nail our value proposition, then neither can our customers. </u></strong> Customers have many choices when purchasing a product or service. Entrepreneurs sometimes become so enamored with their own ideas that they fail to objectively assess the competition. I have certainly been guilty of this myself in the past. I would pooh-pooh a competitor and rationalize that our approach was far more sophisticated and desirable. And yet, I did not ask the bottom-line question of what customers liked better about the competition. We may have a product or service that truly is twice as good as anything else on the market, but unless we can make a clear and concise case for differentiation, we'll be stuck with the rest of the pack. <strong><u>Effectively communicating product or service differentiation means life or death in the business world. </u></strong> A strong uptrend for customer procurement will happen if we practice the basics and fundamentals. This can be accomplished by presenting our product or service in as attractive a manner as possible; when we have a killer value proposition, and when we effectively communicate how we are different. Doing all of this will ensure that we will be the hit of the party. <em>This blog is being written in tandem with my book, “An Entrepreneur's Words to Live By,” available on Amazon.com in paperback and Kindle (</em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/An-Entrepreneurs-Words-Live-By/dp/0615573185/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1347813871&sr=8-1&keywords=an+entrepreneurs+words+to+live+by""><em>My Book</em></a><em>)</em><em>, as well as being available in all of the other major eBook formats. </em><strong></strong> <figure><a href=""https://anentrepreneurswords.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/prom.jpg""><img src=""https://anentrepreneurswords.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/prom.jpg?w=600"" alt="""" /></a></figure>"

mza99um,2025-06-23 06:04:43,en,REDDIT,"  Gonna be honest, main story didn't catch my interest or made me like it. It has good moments for sure, but nothing that will makes wish to anticipate more of it. Villains are one dimensional and dull. Emotional moments while have a good build up and exaction, feel empty? Idk how to explain but I feel attacked only to one side in every emotional scene we had, Colgate and Springfield. Commander always feels so dull in it. Idk why but GF2 Commander feels so boring as character, despite having actually good lines and part of emotional moments, he feels like outsider who barely does anything. Honestly, my main issue is how game drags the 'Commander didn't call his dolls because of promise and obligation' and then almost every character from the first game accuses us of leaving them behind, when as I new player to franchise I get frustrated over MC's actions that quickly stop making sense and become just drama bait. Then there bond scenes where MC is honestly your typical dense protagonist. Another thing, Commander barely interacts with anyone except Groza. He has moments with others but they are so far in between, he feels like outsider to main team. Compared to Nikke story that until 30s chapters overall had little issues with pacing and making entire cast feel like actual team. Counters quickly feel like an actual team with dynamics and their own history despite only meeting in first chapter. Meanwhile what dynamic does Krolik has with anyone outside Nemesis? Blushing when Commander talks to her? Nemesis is the same. Colgate has better interactions with almost everyone than Krolik, Nemesis and Groza. Gameplay wise, while I enjoy it, 6 months and there is nothing new. No new interactive maps, no new in testing enemies. Boss fights are gimmicky and boring. Gonna be honest, I'm here more fore dorm interactions at this point because everything else is just not captivating enough. I will keep playing game, but in the future if I will need to ditch one gacha for new one, GF2 will be my first choice."

Broader market indices The shares of smallcap and midcap companies recovered sharply on June 23, pushing the broader market indices into the green while benchmarks hovered in the red. The Nifty Smallcap 100 index recovered over 1.2 percent from its intraday low level to stand at around 18,281 in the morning. The Nifty Midcap 100 index meanwhile rose nearly 1 percent from its day's low to hover around 58,112. The indices have now extended gains for the second consecutive session, after a multi-session losing streak. Story continues below Top midcap gainers: Glenmark Pharma shares were the top gainer on the midcap index, jumping over 3 percent to trade at Rs 1,693 apiece. Dixon Tech and Polycab shares followed, rising over 3 percent each. Defence majors Mazagon Dock Shipbuilders, Bharat Dynamics (BDL) and Cochin Shipyard shares gained over 2 percent, while AB Capital and NHPC shares gained around 2 percent. Other notable midcap stocks which recorded strong gains include Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE), Nykaa, HUDCO, Hindustan Zinc, Colgate Palmolive, MRF, National Aluminium, Paytm and others. Top smallcap gainers: On the smallcap index, Kfin Tech shares were the top gainer, jumping over 5 percent to trade at Rs 1,336 apiece. Zen Tech shares meanwhile rallied 5 percent to hit the upper circuit at Rs 1,995 apiece. Other notable smallcap stocks which recorded strong gains include ITI, GRSE, Poonawalla Fincorp, NBCC, Amber Enterprises, Angel One, CDSL, Nuvama, MCX, BEML, Laurus Labs and more. Here's what analysts say Story continues below Notably, analysts have noted that the earlier drop in the stock prices were driven by profit booking following a record run. ""Broader market sentiment remained risk-averse [earlier], as mid- and small-cap segments witnessed pronounced profit-booking. [The drop reflected] a flight to safety as market participants rotated capital into large-cap, defensively positioned blue-chip counters,"" said Bajaj Broking. ""The recent correction in small- and mid-cap stocks is driven by profit booking and stretched valuations after a sharp rally, alongside concerns over rising crude prices due to geopolitical tensions. These factors have heightened inflation worries and dampened market sentiment. Investors should adopt a selective, long-term approach—focusing on quality stocks with strong fundamentals, reasonable valuations, and credible promoters,"" said Ajit Mishra, SVP of Research at Religare Broking Ltd. However, with significant correction having taken place in the space during its three-day losing streak, the midcap and smallcap stocks may have again attracted investor interest."

Currently operating with Colgate and Palmolive, the company is in discussions for expansion into India's growing market. MD & CEO Prabha Narasimhan emphasizes the focus on leveraging a diverse product portfolio to capitalize on India's demographic and economic potential. FMCG giant Colgate-Palmolive (India) is set to widen its footprint in the burgeoning Indian market by introducing more brands from its global portfolio. This strategic move forms part of the company's growth blueprint, as explained by Managing Director and CEO Prabha Narasimhan on Monday. Currently active in oral and personal care with its flagship brands Colgate and Palmolive, the company is in ongoing discussions with its parent firm to explore further brand expansions. Narasimhan emphasized the enthusiastic support from global counterparts, underscoring India's key role in the company's international strategy. With 88 years of history in India, Colgate-Palmolive currently accounts for 4-5% of the New York-based multinational's global revenue. Narasimhan projects an increase in this contribution as India, home to over 1.4 billion people, becomes a central growth market. Further digital expansion through e-commerce channels is also underway."

FMCG major Colgate-Palmolive (India) plans to introduce more brands here from the company's global portfolio to upscale its play in India -- one of the drivers for its growth, MD & CEO Prabha Narasimhan said on Monday. New Delhi, Jun 23 (PTI) FMCG major Colgate-Palmolive (India) plans to introduce more brands here from the company's global portfolio to upscale its play in India -- one of the drivers for its growth, MD & CEO Prabha Narasimhan said on Monday. The company, having presence in the country with two brands - Colgate and Palmolive - currently operates in the oral care and personal care, and is in ""active ongoing conversation"" with the parent firm for expanding the portfolio. ""We are very excited about what all we can do in India, both with our existing brands and portfolio, and with what we can do with the things that we can bring in from the globe. We have tremendous support from our global counterparts in terms of their excitement about what we can achieve in India,"" Narasimhan told PTI. About the Palmolive brand, which is currently operating in the personal care space with a premium body wash and hand wash range, Narasimhan said, they have tremendous potential and grow at 20 to 30 per cent CAGR. When asked as whether Colgate-Palmolive India Ltd (CPIL) will extend the brand Palmolive in new segments, she added she would rather focus on introducing more brands. ""Actually, more than extending the brand Palmolive, we have a lot of products portfolio that is available globally. We are looking to see what of that product portfolio can legitimately be brought into India and make sense for the Indian consumer, and leverage the strengths that Colgate Palmolive India has. So that's a very active ongoing conversation,"" she added. CPIL, which has been operating in India for the last 88 years, currently contributes around 4 to 5 per cent of the global revenue of the Midtown Manhattan, New York City-based multinational consumer products major Colgate-Palmolive Company. According to Narasimhan, ""in the coming years, the contribution of India will certainly increase."" India, with its over 1.4 billion population, is always a ""central part"" of Colgate's global strategy and is now among five markets, which are called out as being the drivers of growth. ""If you listen to our global CEO... who was speaking even recently at a conference where he talked about the fact that India will add more middle-class people in the next few years than any other country in the world, and therefore represents a tremendous opportunity for us,"" she said. Besides, on the channel side, CPIL, as per its strategy, is also extending its play into the fast-growing e-commerce channels, by adding more digital-first brands, exclusive to online sales channels. It has launched Colgate Purple and Max Fresh Sensories range, mouthwash sticks, which is for a small audience in the market. ""We have quite a few, and we have a pipeline of many more,"" she added. However, she also added that traditional trade, which is neighbourhood kirana stores, is actually the bulk of CPIL's business and critical for the company. It has a ""tremendous relationship"" with its distributors, many of whom have been with it for decades. Earlier in May, All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF), an umbrella body of FMCG distributors pan-India, had called for the suspension of the purchase of all products of CPIL in Maharashtra, alleging deep discounting by it in favour of quick commerce channels. However, Narasimhan said there is ""enough room"" for all the channels in the market. Talking about the trend of consumers becoming more health-conscious, seeking better products and organic options, Narasimhan said consumers buy benefits and CPIL has the right science to deliver all of these benefits. Recently, the oral care segment has witnessed heightened competition, where several brands have launched their toothpaste based on ingredients derived from traditional ayurveda and organic options. ""Indian consumers are sensible enough to know that they look for a benefit, they find products that deliver to that benefit, and that's our primary job,"" she said."

mov_7CAED61D15D2942FF0EEC64F6E96648E,2025-06-23 18:03:25,en,WEB,"  As accustomed as Matt Desrosiers was to seeing defenseman Haley Winn take one attempt after another at the RapidShot machine inside Clarkson's training facility during her freshman season four years ago, the Golden Knights coach was stunned upon learning the final tally. How does 35,000 shots sound? “We actually had people from RapidShot grab us at the coaches' convention and tell us they hadn't seen anything like it,” Desrosiers said. “And that's not including the pucks she went on the ice and shot extra, too. She's just the most dedicated athlete we've been fortunate enough to have.” The 21-year-old Winn laughed at the memory. “Yeah, that sounds pretty accurate,” she said. “I could stay at the rink all day just because that's what I enjoy doing. I don't have to force myself to do it.” The relentless work translated into Winn completing her college career ranking second among Clarkson defensemen with 130 career points (37 goals, 93 assists), seven behind Erin Ambrose at the school in upstate New York. It helped Winn, at 19, land a spot on the U.S. national team, with her already winning two gold medals in three world championship appearances. And she's considered a top-three pick entering the eight-team, six-round PWHL draft in Ottawa on Tuesday. “It doesn't even feel real that my name should be up there,” said Winn, who got her start at 3 on her father's backyard rink in Rochester, New York. “When I was that young, really, all I wanted to do was go to the Olympics,” added Winn, who has an opportunity to achieve that dream at the Milan-Cortina Winter Games in February. “As I grew older, I realized the steps to get there and what it was going to take. So yeah, it's just awesome.” Sirens have No. 1 pick The New York Sirens hold the No. 1 pick for a second straight year, followed by the Boston Fleet and Toronto Sceptres. Next year's expansion teams, Vancouver and Seattle, pick seventh and eighth, respectively. . Rounding out the top prospects are Colgate forward Kristyna Kaltounkova, who is from the Czech Republic and could be the first European chosen first; and Wisconsin forward Casey O'Brien, this season's Patty Kazmaier Award winner as women's college hockey's MVP. The prevailing consensus has the Sirens looking for a forward to complement last year's No. 1 pick, Sarah Fillier, who finished tied for the PWHL lead with 29 points. New York's offense took a hit in the PWHL's expansion process by losing forwards Alex Carpenter and Jessie Eldridge. They combined for 20 of the team's PWHL-low 71 goals last season. Meantime, New York is deep at defense with the return of Ella Shelton, Maja Nylan Persson and Micah Zandee-Hart. Not ruling out D New York GM Pascal Daoust acknowledged a need at forward, while refusing to rule out targeting a defenseman at No. 1. “Thinking that it automatically means we go forward is probably not covering all the angles, knowing me,” Daoust said, referring to potential trade opportunities. “There's still a lot that can still be done between June and November.” Sirens coach Greg Fargo previously coached Kaltounkova at Colgate, where he also faced Winn in ECAC competition. At 5-foot-9 and 165 pounds, the 23-year-old Kaltounkova brings a physical style with offensive flair. She finished her five-year college career with 233 points (111 goals, 122 assists) and 218 penalty minutes in 171 games. The only potential blemish was the ECAC assessing Kaltounkova a two-game suspension for an undisclosed reason in February 2024, after which she missed two more games to, as the school put it, “step away from the team.” Kaltounkova staying grounded Kaltounkova told the Rinkside Rundown podcast last week she's doing her best to stay grounded in approaching the draft. “There's moments where I'm like, `Oh my god, what if this and what if that?' And then I pause and just like, `I can't think about that.' Like, that would just bring me down a rabbit hole,” she said. “It kind of fuels me because it's either people hyping you up and cheering you on, or it's people criticizing you. And both things motivate me so much.” Kaltounkova had four goals and six points in her world championship tournament debut on home ice in April. “She's coming with speed, she's coming with physicality, she's coming with a great shot — a PWHL shot-level quality,” Daoust said of Kaltounkova. As for Winn, Daoust noted her puck-moving ability and defensive presence. “Great person, great leader, so a lot of positives under her name,” he said. Winn reflected on her younger days in joining her three older brothers on the family's rink. “They never wanted me to play because I was the little sister. But I think I've earned my spot now,” Winn said. “Obviously, they were pretty tough on me. But that's what made me who I am today.” AP women's hockey:  ://apnews.com/hub/womens-hockey..."

mov_A02D9BD65F9222F3859A0EC50D20D354,2025-06-23 19:21:13,en,WEB,"  ABSTRACT Big brands are increasingly courting social media stars, who descended on a major annual festival in France to pitch themselves to advertisers. FULL TEXT Dhar Mann, the creator of a YouTube channel with more than 25 million followers, first heard about the Cannes Lions advertising festival last year from a couple of friends. ""It was incredible - the amount of brands they met, the amount of opportunities that they walked out getting,"" Mr. Mann, 41, said. So this year, he and his wife and the chief executive of his 200-person company, Dhar Mann Studios, flew themselves to the south of France for dozens of meetings with marketers and agencies. The goal, he said, was to land long-term sponsorship deals for his YouTube channel. Marketers, he said, were keen to take the meetings and learn about his videos. Mr. Mann's company has primarily made money through ads on YouTube, he said, but wants to expand revenue, particularly as marketers grow increasingly interested in working with creators to reach consumers. ""Folks are realizing that creators have something special with their audience that paid media can't get you,"" Mr. Mann said. Creator marketing - the business in which brands pay popular social media personalities to promote their wares - has long been a fixture on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok. But social media stars are playing a bigger role in the ad industry than ever, in an era when shows like ""Saturday Night Live"" are drafting talent from TikTok and television ratings continue to erode. The energy was on display this week at Cannes Lions, a major event for the media and tech industry, as social media stars from Amelia Dimoldenberg to Jake Shane made appearances, ad holding companies hailed their creator agency purchases and Forbes unveiled its newest ""Top Creators List"" at a party where more than a few attendees appeared to be trailed by their own photographers. TikTok flew in creators like the Nigerian chef @chefabbys for panels and meetings, including face time with the company's chief executive, Shou Chew. ""Influencers are everything,"" said Craig Brommers, the chief marketing officer of American Eagle Outfitters. ""I don't care if you're a bank, health care, anything - everyone is working with influencers."" While plenty of companies, especially in beauty and fashion, have tapped influencers for a decade now, the scale is new. Unilever, one of the world's biggest advertisers and the owner of brands like Dove and Hellmann's, made waves earlier this year when its chief executive said that half its marketing spending would become ""social-first"" and that the company would work with 20 times as many creators as it had in the past. ""It's a significant part of the marketing transformation we're driving, which is moving from the old 'one to many' communication model - which is one message broadcast to many people - to what we call 'many to many,'"" Esi Eggleston Bracey, Unilever's chief marketing officer, said in an interview this week. Major ad holding companies have also gotten in on the action, suggesting that the Don Drapers of the world need the Alix Earles. Publicis recently announced the acquisition of the creator agency Captiv8 after buying another agency, Influential, last year. WPP has bought Obviously, the Goat Agency and Village Marketing - all agencies that work in the creator space - in the last three years. ""There is seemingly a big opportunity for many of these companies in extending the reach of campaigns with paid media which the agency manages,"" Brian Wieser, a media analyst, wrote in a recent note. He said Hershey, Colgate, Macy's and Gap were among major advertisers that mentioned influencers on recent earnings calls. Coco Bassey, a fashion and lifestyle creator with around 338,000 Instagram followers, said she, too, had paid her own way to attend the ad festival in Cannes. On Wednesday, she met with marketers for Ciroc, the vodka brand, and joined a lunch for creators that Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook, hosted at the Hotel du Cap. She likened her decision to go to Cannes to the time when, in her early years as an influencer, she and a creator friend paid their way to attend Fashion Week in New York and split a hotel room. ""I wasn't even getting invited to shows, but it was coming out, showing up, meeting with brands,"" Ms. Bassey, 37, said. In the last few years, she said, she has attended such events with sponsors like American Express. Marketers are flocking to many creators whose end goal may no longer be ""traditional fame."" Adam Waheed, a 32-year-old comedian who posts as @adamw, said that because his videos got two billion views per month across platforms, ""it's almost a step backward to do an 'S. N.L.'"" Outside of his videos, he has been performing stand-up with mentors including Kevin Hart and working on a movie that he plans to release exclusively on YouTube. ""There's always been this pressure of like, 'Oh, you built this audience - take them to Netflix,"" he said. ""Why can't I just have them right here?"" TikTok sponsored Mr. Waheed's trip, but said he would have flown himself out anyway because of the value in mingling with marketers. He hopes to start landing seven-figure advertising deals soon. ""Everything's six figures,"" he said of his deals now. That is a far cry from where he started, he noted. ""At one point, I would do something for a free hat!"""

The PWHL Draft, set for Tuesday at 7 p.m. ET in Ottawa, will see each team select players over six rounds. The New York Sirens will pick first, followed by the Boston Fleet, Toronto Sceptres, Montreal Victoire, Ottawa Charge, Minnesota Frost, PWHL Vancouver and PWHL Seattle. Vancouver and Seattle will alternate draft positions each round, while the rest of the teams will maintain the same order. Unlike in 2023 and 2024, which brought Taylor Heise (Minnesota) and Sarah Fillier (New York) into the league, the choice at first overall isn't as clear cut this season. The draft also isn't quite as deep as last season, when teams could pick from a large cohort of players finishing their NCAA careers and veterans coming from Europe. But that doesn't mean there isn't high-end talent available. Top contenders to be taken first include Casey O'Brien, a centre out of the University of Wisconsin who scored at a prolific rate in college, sharp-shooting forward Kristýna Kaltounková (Colgate University), and two-way defender Haley Winn (Clarkson University). Here's a look at what each team needs to add, and which draft prospect might fit those needs. New York Sirens Pick: Casey O'Brien, forward (Wisconsin) The Sirens have major holes at forward after losing both Alex Carpenter and Jessie Eldridge to PWHL Seattle. The best outcome for the Sirens would see the team acquire a top forward who can play alongside Fillier, who is a restricted free agent in need of a new contract. Leadership will also be a key factor in who GM Pascal Daoust selects in the draft. Last season, all seven of his picks were former captains. The obvious choice would be O'Brien, the 2025 Patty Kazmaier winner who has the smarts to play alongside one of the world's best forwards. No Wisconsin player, male or female, scored more career points than O'Brien's 267, a number that only seven female players in history have surpassed during their college careers. O'Brien also served as co-captain of the national championship-winning Badgers. What the five-foot-four centre lacks in size, she makes up for with her skating and IQ. ""She plays way above her size,"" Gordie Stafford, who coached O'Brien in prep school at Shattuck-St. Mary's, told CBC Sports. ""Her strength on her skates is incredible, but to also skate on top of the ice like she does, I think that's one of the things that's been really remarkable. You cannot knock that kid off the puck."" Alternatively, New York could opt for Kaltounková, who Sirens' head coach Greg Fargo would know well, having coached Colgate before coming to the PWHL. Boston Fleet Pick: Haley Winn, defender (Clarkson University) GM Danielle Marmer has prioritized rebuilding her defence, where five players have departed due to free agency or expansion. Marmer added size and toughness in free agency with Zoe Boyd and Rylind MacKinnon, but a top-four defender who can move the puck will likely be on her shopping list. Winn would be the perfect candidate. She could play on Boston's top pair beside Megan Keller or anchor a second pair. Clarkson University head coach Matt Desrosiers described Winn as a dynamic defender who excels at both ends of the ice. She's a strong skater, but she also works harder than just about anyone else. ""I've been fortunate to have some really good players go through our program but Haley's definitely at the top as someone who puts in the time, the effort, the preparation,"" Desrosiers told CBC Sports. ""She's really dialled in to reaching her goals of making the Olympics and being on the national team and making it to the PWHL."" Toronto Sceptres Pick: Nicole Gosling, defender (Clarkson University) It wouldn't be a stretch to imagine GM Gina Kingsbury and head coach Troy Ryan opting for a player they know well in Gosling, who became a world champion with Team Canada in 2024. Gosling is an intelligent two-way defender who could quarterback a power play. She models her game after Renata Fast, who would become her teammate. ""She has the ability as a defenceman to slow the game down but then also speed it up,"" Clarkson coach Desrosiers said. Montreal Victoire Pick: Rory Guilday, defender (Cornell University) GM Danièle Sauvageau has done a formidable job rebuilding the team's defence after losing several key pieces to expansion or free agency. She re-signed Kati Tabin and brought in Jessica Digirolamo and Maggie Flaherty via free agency. But adding another top tier defender should be the goal in the first round of the draft. Winn or Gosling would be an ideal fit. Assuming both are gone by the time Montreal picks at number four, the next best bet might be Guilday. The five-foot-11 defender is more of a shutdown type than Gosling or Winn. She won a world championship with Team USA in 2023. Anna Wilgren and Mariah Keopple blocked 117 shots combined on Montreal's blue line last season...."

Isabella Ohrt '25, Brittany Cohen '26, Caiden Williams '26, Grace Owusu-Amoah '26, and Shuhei Matsutoya '28 will engage with an expanded 2025 curriculum, which spans pitching, nonprofit management, film festival strategy, entrepreneurship, and representation. Open conversations and workshops will allow them and their fellow students to seek out opportunities and carve a strategic path into the media industry. Students explore one of six focused tracks through conversations with industry professionals in their field of interest: Narrative Filmmaking, Documentary Filmmaking, Television and Episodic, New Media and Entrepreneurship, Executive Leadership, and Multi-Hyphenate Work. In previous EDU cycles, session leaders have included independent filmmakers as well as representatives from companies such as Netflix, CAA, PBS, MACRO, and ColorCreative. “With the new programmatic tracks, students will gain hands-on experience tailored to their goals — setting them up for the next step in their careers,” said Kia Brooks, The Gotham's deputy director. The Gotham EDU Film and Media Career Development Program runs from June 16 to August 1. The first career development program was held with 22 students in 2020. The summer 2025 program will be the seventh edition with 37 students representing 20 colleges and universities. It will continue to be run virtually to improve access for students across the country. The program is supported through corporate, philanthropic, and institutional support, which covers the full cost of tuition. “Gotham EDU continues to open the door for emerging talent, offering students a rare opportunity to engage directly with working professionals at a formative moment in their creative lives,” said Jeffrey Sharp '89, The Gotham's executive director. “Thanks to the incredible generosity of our supporters and partners, the program has grown into a vital launchpad for the next generation of storytellers and film and media executives, with alumni already making their mark across the industry.” The student participants will also have the opportunity to attend this year's Gotham Week. Select students will participate in shadowing opportunities with companies, including Storm City Films, through the Executive Ambassador track. The program now has 153 alumni representing 35 schools. They have gone on to work at A24, Apple, Amazon Studios, CBS News, HBO Documentaries, Letterboxd, PBS Kids, Warner Bros.

Rather than expanding the Palmolive brand into new segments, Colgate-Palmolive India is aiming to introduce entirely new global brands that align with Indian consumer preferences. “We are very excited about what all we can do in India, both with our existing brands and portfolio, and with what we can bring in from the globe,” said Narasimhan. “We have tremendous support from our global counterparts in terms of their excitement about what we can achieve in India.” India currently contributes 4–5% to Colgate-Palmolive's global revenue. However, the company expects this figure to grow significantly, with India now listed among the five key global markets designated as future growth drivers. “India will add more middle-class people in the next few years than any other country in the world, and therefore represents a tremendous opportunity for us,” Narasimhan added. Colgate-Palmolive India, which has operated in the country for 88 years, is also focusing on digital expansion. The company is strengthening its presence in the e-commerce segment with a range of online-exclusive, digital-first products, including the Colgate Purple and Max Fresh Sensories lines, as well as mouthwash sticks. “We have quite a few, and we have a pipeline of many more,” Narasimhan noted. Despite the growing focus on online sales, the company remains committed to its traditional retail base. Local kirana stores continue to account for the bulk of sales, and Colgate-Palmolive India maintains long-standing relationships with its distributor network. “We have a tremendous relationship with our distributors, many of whom have been with us for decades,” Narasimhan said. This reassurance comes in the wake of a recent call for a product boycott in Maharashtra by the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF), citing concerns over pricing disparities in favour of quick commerce platforms. Addressing this, Narasimhan said there is “enough room” in the market for all channels and reaffirmed the company's commitment to its distributor partnerships. As Indian consumers increasingly prioritise health, sustainability, and ingredient transparency, Colgate-Palmolive India is positioning its science-backed products as competitive alternatives to ayurvedic and organic offerings. “Consumers look for benefits, not just buzzwords, and we're here to deliver exactly that,” Narasimhan said. The Palmolive brand, currently focused on premium body wash and hand wash products, continues to perform well in the personal care space, with reported growth of 20–30% CAGR. However, the company prefers to expand through new global brands rather than stretch Palmolive into unrelated categories. With a population exceeding 1.4 billion and a rapidly expanding middle class, India remains a central focus of Colgate-Palmolive's global strategy. The company is optimistic about its long-term growth prospects in the country."

Palmolive brand shows strong growth potential. The focus is on bringing relevant global products to India. E-commerce expansion is underway with digital-first brands. Traditional trade remains crucial for Colgate-Palmolive India. The company addresses competition and consumer health trends. Press Trust of India Copy Link Share on WhatsApp Share on Linkedin Share on X Share on Telegram Share on Facebook (Mark Stehle/AP Content Services for Colgate Bright Smiles, Bright Futures)FMCG major Colgate-Palmolive (India) plans to introduce more brands here from the company's global portfolio to upscale its play in India -- one of the drivers for its growth, MD & CEO Prabha Narasimhan said on Monday. The company, having presence in the country with two brands - Colgate and Palmolive - currently operates in the oral care and personal care, and is in ""active ongoing conversation"" with the parent firm for expanding the portfolio. ""We are very excited about what all we can do in India, both with our existing brands and portfolio, and with what we can do with the things that we can bring in from the globe. We have tremendous support from our global counterparts in terms of their excitement about what we can achieve in India,"" Narasimhan told PTI. About the Palmolive brand, which is currently operating in the personal care space with a premium body wash and hand wash range, Narasimhan said, they have tremendous potential and grow at 20 to 30 per cent CAGR. When asked as whether Colgate-Palmolive India Ltd (CPIL) will extend the brand Palmolive in new segments, she added she would rather focus on introducing more brands. ""Actually, more than extending the brand Palmolive, we have a lot of products portfolio that is available globally. We are looking to see what of that product portfolio can legitimately be brought into India and make sense for the Indian consumer, and leverage the strengths that Colgate Palmolive India has. So that's a very active ongoing conversation,"" she added. CPIL, which has been operating in India for the last 88 years, currently contributes around 4 to 5 per cent of the global revenue of the Midtown Manhattan, New York City-based multinational consumer products major Colgate-Palmolive Company. According to Narasimhan, ""in the coming years, the contribution of India will certainly increase."" India, with its over 1.4 billion population, is always a ""central part"" of Colgate's global strategy and is now among five markets, which are called out as being the drivers of growth. ""If you listen to our global CEO... who was speaking even recently at a conference where he talked about the fact that India will add more middle-class people in the next few years than any other country in the world, and therefore represents a tremendous opportunity for us,"" she said. Besides, on the channel side, CPIL, as per its strategy, is also extending its play into the fast-growing e-commerce channels, by adding more digital-first brands, exclusive to online sales channels. It has launched Colgate Purple and Max Fresh Sensories range, mouthwash sticks, which is for a small audience in the market. ""We have quite a few, and we have a pipeline of many more,"" she added. However, she also added that traditional trade, which is neighbourhood kirana stores, is actually the bulk of CPIL's business and critical for the company. It has a ""tremendous relationship"" with its distributors, many of whom have been with it for decades. Earlier in May, All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF), an umbrella body of FMCG distributors pan-India, had called for the suspension of the purchase of all products of CPIL in Maharashtra, alleging deep discounting by it in favour of quick commerce channels. However, Narasimhan said there is ""enough room"" for all the channels in the market. Talking about the trend of consumers becoming more health-conscious, seeking better products and organic options, Narasimhan said consumers buy benefits and CPIL has the right science to deliver all of these benefits. Recently, the oral care segment has witnessed heightened competition, where several brands have launched their toothpaste based on ingredients derived from traditional ayurveda and organic options. ""Indian consumers are sensible enough to know that they look for a benefit, they find products that deliver to that benefit, and that's our primary job,"" she said.

f1e28a5dbee39819bdd30b0dcdf5380e,2025-06-24 04:43:00,en,WEB,"  New Delhi: Colgate-Palmolive (India) is in discussions with its parent company to expand its product portfolio in India by introducing additional brands from its global offerings, according to Managing Director and CEO Prabha Narasimhan. The company currently operates in the Indian market with two brands, Colgate in oral care and Palmolive in personal care. Narasimhan said there is ongoing engagement with the global team regarding the possibility of bringing in more products that are relevant for Indian consumers. “We are very excited about what all we can do in India, both with our existing brands and portfolio, and with what we can do with the things that we can bring in from the globe. We have tremendous support from our global counterparts in terms of their excitement about what we can achieve in India,” Narasimhan said. Commenting on Palmolive's performance in the Indian market, where it operates in the premium body wash and hand wash segment, Narasimhan said the brand is witnessing steady growth in the range of 20 to 30 per cent CAGR. However, she indicated that rather than expanding Palmolive into new segments, the focus is on evaluating which global products are suitable for the Indian market. “Actually, more than extending the brand Palmolive, we have a lot of products portfolio that is available globally. We are looking to see what of that product portfolio can legitimately be brought into India and make sense for the Indian consumer, and leverage the strengths that Colgate Palmolive India has. So that's a very active ongoing conversation,” she said. Colgate-Palmolive India, which has been operational in the country for 88 years, currently accounts for around 4 to 5 % of the global revenue of the US-based parent company. Narasimhan noted that India is among the five markets identified by the multinational as key contributors to future growth. “In the coming years, the contribution of India will certainly increase,” she said, adding that the country continues to be an integral part of the group's overall strategy. “If you listen to our global CEO... who was speaking even recently at a conference where he talked about the fact that India will add more middle-class people in the next few years than any other country in the world, and therefore represents a tremendous opportunity for us,” Narasimhan said. In addition to expanding its product mix, Colgate-Palmolive India is strengthening its presence across distribution channels, including digital platforms. The company has introduced digital-first brands, such as Colgate Purple and the Max Fresh Sensories range, which includes mouthwash sticks targeted at niche consumer groups. These products are made available exclusively through online retail. “We have quite a few, and we have a pipeline of many more,” she said. Despite the growing presence of e-commerce, Narasimhan emphasised the continuing significance of traditional trade, including local kirana stores, which she described as forming the core of the company's business. She also highlighted long-standing relationships with distributors across the country. Earlier in May, the All India Consumer Products Distributors Federation (AICPDF) had called for a halt in the purchase of CPIL products in Maharashtra, citing concerns over pricing practices favouring quick commerce platforms. When asked about this, Narasimhan said there is ""enough room"" for multiple sales channels in the market. Addressing evolving consumer preferences, including an increased interest in health and natural products, Narasimhan stated that consumers primarily seek functional benefits and that CPIL's offerings are built around this principle. “Indian consumers are sensible enough to know that they look for a benefit, they find products that deliver to that benefit, and that's our primary job,” she said. The oral care segment in India has seen intensified competition in recent times, with several companies introducing products based on ayurvedic and organic formulations."

EFB0396C37D0CD0E05D717DA57DA800F,2025-06-24 07:20:00,en,PRINT,"  Dhar Mann, the creator of a YouTube channel with more than 25 million followers, first heard about the Cannes Lions advertising festival last year from a couple of friends. ''It was incredible -- the amount of brands they met, the amount of opportunities that they walked out getting,'' Mr. Mann, 41, said. So this year, he and his wife and the chief executive of his 200-person company, Dhar Mann Studios, flew themselves to the south of France for dozens of meetings with marketers and agencies. The goal, he said, was to land long-term sponsorship deals for his YouTube channel. Marketers, he said, were keen to take the meetings and learn about his videos. Mr. Mann's company has primarily made money through ads on YouTube, he said, but wants to expand revenue, particularly as marketers grow increasingly interested in working with creators to reach consumers. ''Folks are realizing that creators have something special with their audience that paid media can't get you,'' Mr. Mann said. Creator marketing -- the business in which brands pay popular social media personalities to promote their wares -- has long been a fixture on Instagram, YouTube and TikTok. But social media stars are playing a bigger role in the ad industry than ever, in an era when shows like ''Saturday Night Live'' are drafting talent from TikTok and television ratings continue to erode. The energy was on display this week at Cannes Lions, a major event for the media and tech industry, as social media stars from Amelia Dimoldenberg to Jake Shane made appearances, ad holding companies hailed their creator agency purchases and Forbes unveiled its newest ''Top Creators List'' at a party where more than a few attendees appeared to be trailed by their own photographers. TikTok flew in creators like the Nigerian chef @chefabbys for panels and meetings, including face time with the company's chief executive, Shou Chew. ''Influencers are everything,'' said Craig Brommers, the chief marketing officer of American Eagle Outfitters. '' I don't care if you're a bank, health care, anything -- everyone is working with influencers.'' While plenty of companies, especially in beauty and fashion, have tapped influencers for a decade now, the scale is new. Unilever, one of the world's biggest advertisers and the owner of brands like Dove and Hellmann's, made waves earlier this year when its chief executive said that half its marketing spending would become ''social-first'' and that the company would work with 20 times as many creators as it had in the past. ''It's a significant part of the marketing transformation we're driving, which is moving from the old 'one to many' communication model -- which is one message broadcast to many people -- to what we call 'many to many,''' Esi Eggleston Bracey, Unilever's chief marketing officer, said in an interview this week. Major ad holding companies have also gotten in on the action, suggesting that the Don Drapers of the world need the Alix Earles. Publicis recently announced the acquisition of the creator agency Captiv8 after buying another agency, Influential, last year. WPP has bought Obviously, the Goat Agency and Village Marketing -- all agencies that work in the creator space -- in the last three years. ''There is seemingly a big opportunity for many of these companies in extending the reach of campaigns with paid media which the agency manages,'' Brian Wieser, a media analyst, wrote in a recent note. He said Hershey, Colgate, Macy's and Gap were among major advertisers that mentioned influencers on recent earnings calls. Coco Bassey, a fashion and lifestyle creator with around 338,000 Instagram followers, said she, too, had paid her own way to attend the ad festival in Cannes. On Wednesday, she met with marketers for Ciroc, the vodka brand, and joined a lunch for creators that Meta, the owner of Instagram and Facebook, hosted with The Ankler, a media company, at the Hotel du Cap. She likened her decision to go to Cannes to the time when, in her early years as an influencer, she and a creator friend paid their way to attend Fashion Week in New York and split a hotel room. ''I wasn't even getting invited to shows, but it was coming out, showing up, meeting with brands,'' Ms. Bassey, 37, said. In the last few years, she said, she has attended such events with sponsors like American Express. Marketers are flocking to many creators whose end goal may no longer be ''traditional fame.'' Adam Waheed, a 32-year-old comedian who posts as @adamw, said that because his videos got two billion views per month across platforms, ''it's almost a step backward to do an 'S. N.L.''' Outside of his videos, he has been performing stand-up with mentors including Kevin Hart and working on a movie that he plans to release exclusively on YouTube. ''There's always been this pressure of like, 'Oh, you built this audience -- take them to Netflix,'' he said. '' Why can't I just have them right here?'' TikTok sponsored Mr. Waheed's trip, but said he would have flown himself out anyway because of the value in mingling with marketers. He hopes to start landing seven-figure advertising deals soon. ''Everything's six figures,'' he said of his deals now. That is a far cry from where he started, he noted. '' At one point, I would do something for a free hat!''"

mov_A322789B675D03B785673BD905DF6A2C,2025-06-24 11:00:00,en,WEB,"  The PWHL's Sirens scored big with the top overall draft pick last year in Rookie of the Year shoo-in Sarah Fillier. Now, after a second straight last-place finish and the hectic movement around the league's expansion process, they're back with the No. 1 pick in Tuesday night's draft. Unlike with Fillier, there is no consensus No. 1 pick this season. The conversation about the No. 1 pick revolves around three college standouts: Colgate forward Kristyna Kaltounkova, Wisconsin forward Casey O'Brien and Clarkson defender Haley Winn. Other top prospects to watch include Nicole Gosling, Natalie Mlynkova and Rory Guilday. When is the 2025 PWHL draft? The 2025 PWHL draft takes place on Tuesday, June 24, at 7 p.m. ET in Ottawa, Ontario. The league's eight teams, including the two expansion teams, will select 48 players during a six-round process. The Sirens are followed by the Boston Fleet, Toronto Scepters, Montreal Victoire, Ottawa Charge and the Minnesota Frost. PWHL Vancouver and PWHL Seattle participate in a random draw to determine their first-round order of selection. After the first round, the two expansion teams will alternate positions while the other six maintain their order. Explore More In addition to the No. 1 pick, the Sirens have the No. 9, No. 17, No. 25, No. 33 and No. 41 picks. What's the state of the Sirens roster? The Sirens lost top goal-scorer Alex Carpenter and first-string goalie Corinne Schroeder to PWHL Seattle after leaving them unprotected in the exclusive signing window for expansion teams. Later Jessie Eldridge was selected by PWHL Seattle, with Gabby Rosenthal headed to PWHL Vancouver in the expansion draft. Since the expansion draft, New York has re-signed Taylor Girard, Lauren Bernard, Kayla Vespa and Savannah Norcross to one-year contracts. They also picked up Jincy Roese, an alternate captain for the Ottawa Charge for the last two seasons. Teams can continue signing players on expiring contracts and completing trades, which may include 2025 draft picks, until the signing period pauses on Friday, June 27 and re-opens on July 8. Sirens general manager Pascal Daoust has expressed confidence in the back end with defenders such as Ella Shelton and Micah Zandee-Hart, who were protected from expansion teams along with Fillier. With this, an emphasis may be placed on drafting forwards to complement Fillier. Who could the Sirens pick at No. 1? Kristyna Kaltounkova: The former Colgate forward is on paper a perfect pick for New York. Not only did she play at Colgate under current Siren's head coach Greg Fargo, but she also comes with solid stats and international experience playing for her native Czech Republic. During the collegiate season, she ranked No. 6 in goals per game (0.70), and at Colgate holds the records for most goals in program history (111), most game-winning goals (19) and most power-play goals (37). “[Kaltounkova] is built for the PWHL game,” said Casey Ditzel, play-by-play announcer for Clarkson, Colgate's rival in the ECAC. “She's a big-body player, a physical forward that can dominate puck possession but also has 50-goal scorer capabilities. … She really dominated in college.” Casey O'Brien: O'Brien is the reigning Patty Kazmaier Memorial Award winner as the top player in college hockey. A three-time national champion and two-time First Team All-American with Wisconsin, O'Brien led the country with 88 points and 62 assists. Haley Winn: If the Sirens go defense, Winn figures to be the pick. The First Team All-American out of Clarkson can play both ends of the rink and ranked No. 7 nationally this past season in assists per game (0.84). She also helped the USA win gold at April's World Championships. “I think Haley Winn is a generational talent,” Ditzel said. “She is a player that has a skill set that has not been seen very often or at all in women's hockey. She has the skating ability to contend with forwards from a defensive position. She has a shot that Pierre McGuire touted as an NHL-caliber shot, which is something that's never seen in women's hockey. … A player who is likely going to wear the 'C' for Team USA in the future and is going to be the face of women's hockey when we look down the road in 10 years.” Who are some possibilities for the Sirens' No. 9 pick? Michelle Karvinen: Under the radar compared to the draftees coming straight out of college, the 35-year-old Karvinen enters the draft as an established star in Europe. The forward is a three-time Olympic bronze medalist for Finland, a four-time SDHL Champion and a Russian League Champion. Jenna Buglioni: The forward was a two-time national champion and captain for the Buckeyes. She tallied 70 goals and 94 assists in her career while becoming the program record-holder for game-winning goals. She is small, though, coming in at 5-foot-3. Nicole Gosling: Another stellar defender from Clarkson, Gosling is also a part of the Canadian national team. While unlikely to get out of the first round, she could be a steal at the No. 9 pick. “Gosling is a building block that's going to be sturdy on the defensive end,” Ditzel said. “She showed over five years at Clarkson that she can play big minutes. She can take power play roles and penalty kills. She has the ability to run a blue line.”..."

Fake example, if their seller/brand name is Oakly Moss. They are changing a colgate toothpaste listing, changing brand name from colgate to Oakly Moss & changing title from colgate toothpaste to colgate toothpaste with Oakly Moss sticker. Then they are reporting all other sellers on the listing as violating their Oakly & Moss trademark. Is this a reportable offense to Amazon?

At Colgate this season, she finished top-10 in goals in the nation and set a program record in goals (111) and game-winning goals (19). She finished her career just six points shy of the Colgate record in points, which is held by Danielle Serdachny, who was drafted second overall last season. Kaltounková is a pro-ready forward who already has experience at the senior international level; she was tied for the scoring lead for Czechia in her women's world championship debut in April. She has a solid frame (5-foot-9) and strong skating with a physical style of play that will benefit her in the PWHL. Kaltounková has a heavy and accurate shot that makes her a consistent threat in the offensive zone and off the rush. She wins puck battles along the wall, plays through contact, and does well to get to the netfront, where she has good hands and uses her size to take away goalies' sightlines. In New York, Kaltounková could center her own line, giving the Sirens a one-two punch up the middle behind Canadian star Sarah Fillier. Or one of the two could move to the wing to load up the top line. Last season, Fillier was excellent on the wing beside Alex Carpenter. But after Carpenter was left unprotected in expansion and signed in Seattle, there's a major hole at the top of New York's lineup. Kaltounková could fill that position either at center or on the wing with her shot and nose for the net. Defender Haley Winn and forward Casey O'Brien were other potential No. 1 picks, but with seven defenders currently on the roster it makes sense that New York opted for a forward. O'Brien was the No. 1 prospect in 's pre-draft ranking, but Kaltounková has history playing for New York coach Greg Fargo at Colgate, which made her an easy selection. Kaltounková is New York's second-straight No. 1 selection after drafting Fillier first in 2024. The Sirens have finished last in the PWHL standings in back-to-back seasons and won the Gold Plan — the league's innovative approach to determining its draft order — and the No. 1 pick in both years. The hope for the Sirens is that with Fillier and Kaltounková at the top of the lineup, the team can climb out of the basement of the standings for the first time in 2025-26. But a Fillier contract extension looms large — she only signed a one-year contract and is a restricted free agent — and is the single-biggest item on Daoust's to-do list this offseason.

Kaltounková became the first player from the Czech Republic to become a finalist for the Patty Kazmaier Award as the top player in college hockey this season at Colgate, where she produced 48 points in 37 games. She is Colgate's all-time leading goal scorer, with 111 goals over five seasons. In her world championship debut this past spring, Kaltounková tied fellow draft-eligible forward, Natálie Mlýnková, for the team lead in points (six in seven games). She is now the highest-drafted player in the PWHL from the Czech Republic. The Sirens could slot Kaltounková on its first line alongside Sarah Fillier, giving the team two bonafide shooting threats, and filling a hole left by the departure of Alex Carpenter during the expansion process. Kaltounková is New York's second first-overall pick in three PWHL seasons, after GM Pascal Daoust picked Fillier in 2024. PWHL GMs will select players over six rounds at the PWHL Draft. New York has the first pick of each round, followed by the Boston Fleet, Toronto Sceptres, Montreal Victoire, Ottawa Charge, Minnesota Frost, PWHL Vancouver and PWHL Seattle. Vancouver and Seattle will swap draft order in each subsequent round. The draft comes after an expansion process that saw the league's rosters thrown in a blender. Vancouver and Seattle will begin play next season, and lots of teams still have holes to fill after the expansion draft and free agency. Other top prospects include University of Wisconsin forward Casey O'Brien and Clarkson University defenders Haley Winn and Nicole Gosling."

Gentry, a 5-foot-11 forward with the Colgate Huskies, was the third pick in the second round by the Toronto Sceptres. In the third round, Anna Segedi of St. Lawrence University was taken by the two-time defending champion Minnesota Frost with the sixth pick. In the fourth round, Ohio State defenseman Riley Brengman of China, Mich., was selected by the Boston Fleet with the second pick, and Commerce goalie Callie Shanahan of Boston University was drafted by the New York Sirens with the fourth pick. Also Tuesday, Sault Ste. Marie's Abby Roque was traded from the Sirens to the Montréal Victoire in exchange for forward Kristin O'Neill and their fourth-round pick. Roque had 12 goals and 18 assists in 54 games in two seasons with the Sirens, who opened the draft by selecting Colgate forward Kristyna Kaltounkova with the No. 1 pick. Kaltounkova is from the Czech Republic and became the first European-born player to go first in the PWHL draft. She is reunited with Sirens coach Greg Fargo, who coached her at Colgate. Kaltounkova leaves the Raiders after five seasons as the school's career-leading scorer with 111 goals and second with 223 points. The PWHL draft features five rounds with eight teams. Come back for complete results when the draft ends. Darche weighs Hagens with top pick Mathieu Darche's phone keeps ringing as he prepares for his first NHL draft as general manager of the New York Islanders, and he's sure of only one thing: They are not trading the No. 1 pick. Beyond that, it's wide open. While Darche is not saying, the growing consensus is the Islanders are expected to select defenseman Matthew Schaefer on Friday night. With Long Island native James Hagens also in the mix as a likely top-10 pick, there has been plenty of speculation about them making a splash to trade back into the first half of the first round to get both. Link to Image “I'm looking at everything,"" Darche said on a video call with reporters Tuesday. "" If I feel the opportunity warrants that trade, I'll try it. … Whether it's moving up in the draft with another pick, whether it's acquiring another pick, whether it's trading another pick to get a player, I'm looking at all options to improve our team.” Hagens grew up in Hauppauge going to Nassau Coliseum as a kid. He still has the towel from his first playoff game, and his buddies who are Islanders fans were pumped to see them win the draft lottery to get the first pick. It has started to look increasingly unlikely that Hagens is the top prospect in this draft, but that has not stopped folks in the New York area from rooting for Darche to keep the local boy. Hagens has had people approach him on the golf course and recently saw a bumper sticker reading, “Bring Hagens Home,” at which point he tried to drive by without making eye contact. “It was cool,” Hagens a bit blushingly acknowledged. “Moments like that, it puts a smile on your face.” Hagens, a 5-foot-11 center who was a point-a-game player during his freshman season at Boston College, spoke with Darche but also sounds at peace with the possibility he ends up somewhere else. ""I have no idea what's going to happen on draft day, so it's just being ready,"" Hagens said during the top prospects' visit to the Stanley Cup Final in South Florida earlier this month. “I know that whatever team does takes the chance on me, I'm a loyal guy so I'd want to stick with them for however long they want me. I just want to be at a spot that wants me the most."" That still could be the Islanders, though probably not the rival Rangers after they transferred the 12th pick to Pittsburgh on Tuesday to complete an earlier trade and keep their first-rounder next year. Maybe Hagens is playing down I-95 in Philadelphia, up the East Coast in Boston or across New York in Buffalo. Schaefer and a couple of centers, Canadian Michael Misa and Swede Anton Frondell, are expected to be the top three off the board. San Jose, which took Macklin Celebrini first a year ago, and Chicago, which got Connor Bedard at No. 1 in 2023, have the second and third picks after New York. ""We're going to keep debating it till the end, keep calling around and getting as much info,"" said Darche, who spent seven seasons in Tampa Bay's front office before getting his first job running an NHL team. “There's a few guys we like, and do I have an idea at this point because it's in four days? Probably. But we're going to keep doing our due diligence all the way through Friday.” Asked specifically about Schaefer, Darche raved about the maturity of the soon-to-be-18-year-old, who has dealt with the grief of the deaths of his mom and his junior hockey host family mother in Erie and has turned it into a way of helping others. “He's an impressive young man,” Darche said. ""He's a hell of a player. He's a great person. But having said that, there's a lot of other kids at the draft that we met that are very impressive. That's why I say, regardless of who we pick on Friday, we'll get a special player that's going to help the New York Islanders fairly quickly.” Marchment excited for fresh start Seattle – Stanley Cup playoff hockey hasn't been all that common in Seattle since the Kraken played their first season. However, Mason Marchment already knows full well what it looks like. Marchment, who was acquired from the Dallas Stars last Thursday for a 2025 fourth-round pick and a 2026 third-rounder, played in a few of the Stanley Cup playoff games at Climate Pledge Arena in 2023 when the Kraken and Stars faced off. Dallas won the second-round series in seven games, but Marchment learned firsthand just how rowdy fans in the Emerald City can get...."

mov_D9A330755B798FF57C8DA66D8D4F6BF5,2025-06-25 21:31:33,en,WEB,"  Wednesday morning, Marie-Philip Poulin and Montreal Victoire cleaned up at the 2025 PWHL Awards. The Montreal captain, who led the league with 19 goals in 30 regular-season games, was named the league's top forward and winner of the Billie Jean King MVP Award. Amid a decorated career that includes three Olympic gold medals, four world championship golds and, last week, the IIHF's 2024-25 female player of the year award, the 34-year-old called her latest honors “pretty special.” After acknowledging the support of her teammates, she admitted that “Honestly, I would exchange these trophies for the bigger one — that's for sure.” Despite finishing comfortably atop the regular-season standings, the Victoire failed to advance out of the first round of the Walter Cup playoffs for the second-straight year. Montreal netminder Ann-Renee Desbiens was also named the league's goaltender of the year, coach Kori Cheverie was named coach of the year, and forward Laura Stacey received the 'Hockey for All' award, which recognized the player who made the biggest impact in her community during the 2024-25 season. Stacey raised over $100,000 through her 'LS7 Sticks In For Charity' Road Hockey Tournament, with funds supporting under-resourced communities in Toronto and Montreal. “As I'm starting to get older and realize that I do want to have an impact and we could leave a legacy,” said Stacey, 31. “There's so many leaders, trailblazers and community heroes who have done so much for sport and for women, so it was a huge honor to receive this award today. I definitely don't take it lightly.” Renata Fast of the Toronto Sceptres won the league's defender of the year award, and Sarah Fillier of the New York Sirens was named the league's top rookie. Sirens Take Big Swings At The Draft On Tuesday, Fillier's Sirens had a dramatic evening at the PWHL's third entry draft. After his team finished last in the standings for a second-straight season, GM Pascal Daoust elected to shake things up with the league's first-ever draft-day player trade, moving defender Ella Shelton to Toronto in exchange for the third-overall pick and the No. 27 pick. After scoring the fewest total goals over the league's first two seasons and losing top forwards Jessie Eldridge and Alex Carpenter to Seattle during the expansion process, the Sirens made Kristyna Kaltounkova of Colgate University the first Czech player ever to be selected first overall at the PWHL draft. Then, Daoust followed up by choosing 2025 Patty Kazmaier Award winner Casey O'Brien out of the University of Wisconsin, thus boosting his forward group with arguably the two top talents available this year. Later, Daoust dealt forward Abby Roque to Montreal in exchange for gritty forward Kristin O'Neill and the 28th pick. When the dust settled, the Sirens had made nine picks in the six-round draft — six forwards, one defender and two goaltenders. “We felt that it was an opportunity for us to gear up and cover a new angle,” Daoust said. “We're very happy with it.” Vancouver And Ottawa Take International Approach As the PWHL prioritized competitive balance when setting the stage for its expansion process and with more expansion on the horizon, it has become apparent that teams might not get the opportunity to develop their draft prospects over a period of time. Five of last year's six first-round picks were claimed by the two new expansion teams, with Seattle bringing in Danielle Serdachny (Ottawa), Hannah Bilka (Boston), Cayla Barnes (Montreal) and Julia Gosling (Toronto), while Vancouver signed Claire Thompson away from Minnesota. Rather than look for NCAA prospects to develop at the draft, the GMs for Vancouver and Ottawa looked to Europe to add immediate offensive pop. Vancouver GM Cara Gardner Morey used her team's first-round pick at No. 7 to select Michelle Karvinen, a 35-year-old Finn who is a legend in the international game. Her eight world championship medals include a silver from 2019, and she served as captain of Finland's bronze-medal group in 2025. Lately, Karvinen has been playing in Sweden. Earlier in her career, she spent three years at the University of North Dakota. She also won a championship with the KRS Vanke Rays in Russia's women's league in 2021-22, on a team coached by new Vancouver bench boss Brian Idalski which also included PWHL Vancouver players Michela Cava and Hannah Miller. “I just kept hoping that no one picked her ahead of us,” said Gardner Morey. “We obviously wanted a top forward and Michelle is a proven winner — she's got the experience. I think that leadership, and veteran players, are really important in this league. We had a chance to get one of those in an entry draft that's usually not available. I've gotten to know her personality through some players, and she's going to be one of those special players in the locker room.” Gardner Morey also shored up her crease through a trade. Former Toronto Sceptres netminder Kristen Campbell headed west along with the 19th pick in a deal that saw Vancouver send the 16th and 23rd picks to the Sceptres. Vancouver then selected North Vancouver native Nina Jobst-Smith with that 19th pick and closed out the draft by choosing the PWHL's first-ever South Asian player and the only player this year from Canada's USports program — local product Chanreet Bassi from the University of British Columbia. After the Walter Cup finalist Ottawa Charge lost 15-goal-scorer Tereza Vanisova to Vancouver as well as seeing Serdachny go to Seattle, GM Mike Hirshfeld set his sights on two veteran forwards from Russia's women's league. With the fifth pick in the second round, he selected 28-year-old Anna Shokhina. He added her 27-year-old St. Petersburg teammate, Fanuza Kadirova, in Round 6. “We think Anna Shokhina — we had her as probably the fourth-most-talented player in this draft. That's how highway we thought of her,” Hirshfeld said. “To get her at 13 was really exciting for us. We think she's going to be a superstar in this league.” One other veteran from the European leagues was also selected. Sara Hjalmarsson, a 27-year-old Swedish defender, went to Toronto in the fifth round. Roster Rebuilds After the shocking losses of the expansion process, the inaugural six teams and their fanbases can now breathe a little easier. Forty-six new roster spots were created by adding the Vancouver and Seattle franchises, and 48 players were selected in Tuesday's draft. That breaks down to 30 forwards, 13 defenders and 5 goaltenders, with 43 players coming out of NCAA programs...."
eb4a8e43aa5d771c211e267543f10438,2025-06-25 21:37:00,en,WEB,"  It was a balmy Windsor evening in 1878 and her grandson, Prince William of Prussia, was in attendance as Queen Victoria entertained the distinctly deaf Rear-Admiral The Hon Fitzgerald Algernon Foley to dinner. Conversation lagging, she asked kindly after his sister, whom said Admiral foggily mistook for the recently wrecked training-ship Eurydice – which he had just raised and salvaged, hence this coveted invitation for soup-to-nuts at the Royal table. ' Well, Ma'am, I am going to turn her over and have her bottom scraped…' As the future Kaiser Wilhelm II would dine out on for the rest of his life, Victoria 'hid her face in her handkerchief and shook and heaved with laughter,' as others present gnawed their napkins, or a knuckle, in desperate suppression of mirth. ' Yet,' as Elizabeth Longford intoned in an early, 1983 biography of our own late Queen, Victoria's great-great-granddaughter, 'only two photographs have ever been published of this amused old lady smiling.' Smiling is precious, personal – and, on occasion, political. As I thought lately when a text-messaged pinged from my dentist, suggesting I book what said BDS calls my annual check-up and what I like to call smile-maintenance. I happen to be blessed with a natural lighthouse-smile, at least since I quit smoking in 2014 and my gnashers lost the impression of tenemented Partick c 1969. And that, bar two wisdom-jobs I wisely had extracted in 2004 - I focused hard on the ceiling as the redoubtable dentist braced his left foot against the chair - all the MacLeod fangs survive and my two lonely fillings have been deftly maintained since the Callaghan administration. One is, indeed, gold, though you'd need to be tickling my tonsils to have the chance for a glimpse: the queue to do so is oddly short. Taking care of your smile can defuse a lot of tricky situations But among the things I missed most, amidst the bemasked foggy-specs era of you-know-what half a decade ago, was the inability to lighten or defuse so many social, supermarket-aisle situations simply by beaming. I ended up hoisting my left hand in a sort of me-Tarzan-you-Jane placatory habit instead, and we were well into 2024 before I finally broke it. In September 2022, when all was over, I was briefly in sole charge of the family home in Edinburgh and an Amazon delivery dude called just half a minute before I was safely home with the Scottish Daily Mail and my lunch. I enthused. I sprinted. I gabbled. Moments later, I beheld him. I was late and he was Polish, but I raised an arm and beamed and, in an instant, our lad Zycinski glowed back in parallel ivory-castles. If you heard that wonderful What's up Doc? episode on Radio Four the other day – presented by identical twins Chris and Xand van Tulleken, still available on BBC Sounds – you will already know that smiling is a gesture both placatory and defensive. We do not usually switch on the famous grin with people we live with, or see every day. That's a realm of grunts, gurgles and downplayed chuckles. We smile for sought-after and hopeful significant others, eminent strangers, and potential foes. The gesture – not that I endorse van Tulleken evolutionary nonsense – is, like the chimpanzees recruited of yore for P G Tips ads, actually a fear-based grin. I am here, this is me, and I am no threat to you. In fact, the loveliest smile I ever saw – personally, and just for me, across St George's Gallery in Windsor Castle – was in April 2002 and from our late Queen, who for the Golden Jubilee had heroically invited the company of 500 of her best friends In the British media. An experiment she never repeated. To her, the Press was a necessary evil and, though I enjoyed banter with Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, to him we were a wholly unnecessary evil. For half a century on the throne, Elizabeth II had the daunting competition of her mother, her face blessed with a natural smile even in repose. The Queen's natural expression was earnest. Humourless. Late in life, she managed to make a joke of it. ' Oh, look, Philip, I've got my Miss Piggy face on…' But, even before she turned thirty – touring Canada and the USA as Princess Elizabeth; the Antipodes in 1953 as new-minted Queen – folk jibed at how often they beheld an unsmiling face. Even though, as she once justly protested, she would smile till it hurt. ' My mother is a star,' she once flared, around 1985. ' My daughter-in-law is a star. What does that make me?' Elizabeth the Steadfast, as it proved, beloved and respected – though the Queen was well in her seventies before reaching that haven. It is striking, looking back and over a longer arc of modern history, how late it is before we actually see many folk smiling. The Mona Lisa musters the faintest simper.

But there is also the horrific cultural fracture of the Great War. Before it, we have a gazillion surviving images of boys and youths in happy sporting teams, genial clubs and the Boys Brigade and so on, arms draped over one another, hands on mutual knees, cheek-to-cheek chumship and evidently poised to kick seven bells out of their opponents. Afterwards, we are suddenly in an era where it is all crossed-arms, upright posture, stern gazes ahead and where you sense – mere opponents duly defeated – said lads might then happily knock seven bells out of each other. On top of that, we have the ensuing decades of when cameras were still rather slow affairs and when, even in my lifetime, many public figures still had terrible teeth. Denis Healey, Denis Thatcher, Charlie Haughey, Mick McGahey– yellow, jaggy tartar-clotted leers. In the vanguard of a new political master-race, John F Kennedy blithely re-invented the modern professional politician as The Beatles recast the pop group. Hatless, 2-button suited, narrow tie, a glowing grin, permanent tan and a big, newscasterish TV head. But even Kennedy, as someone once shrewdly observed, was careful whom he was snapped smiling with: no photo-opportunity shared with Nixon or Khruschev betrays more than a scholarly frown...."
9131a827f3ecfbddbd696cf8707fa790,2025-06-25 21:37:00,en,WEB,"  It was a balmy Windsor evening in 1878 and her grandson, Prince William of Prussia, was in attendance as Queen Victoria entertained the distinctly deaf Rear-Admiral The Hon Fitzgerald Algernon Foley to dinner. Conversation lagging, she asked kindly after his sister, whom said Admiral foggily mistook for the recently wrecked training-ship Eurydice – which he had just raised and salvaged, hence this coveted invitation for soup-to-nuts at the Royal table. ' Well, Ma'am, I am going to turn her over and have her bottom scraped…' As the future Kaiser Wilhelm II would dine out on for the rest of his life, Victoria 'hid her face in her handkerchief and shook and heaved with laughter,' as others present gnawed their napkins, or a knuckle, in desperate suppression of mirth. ' Yet,' as Elizabeth Longford intoned in an early, 1983 biography of our own late Queen, Victoria's great-great-granddaughter, 'only two photographs have ever been published of this amused old lady smiling.' Smiling is precious, personal – and, on occasion, political. As I thought lately when a text-messaged pinged from my dentist, suggesting I book what said BDS calls my annual check-up and what I like to call smile-maintenance. I happen to be blessed with a natural lighthouse-smile, at least since I quit smoking in 2014 and my gnashers lost the impression of tenemented Partick c 1969. And that, bar two wisdom-jobs I wisely had extracted in 2004 - I focused hard on the ceiling as the redoubtable dentist braced his left foot against the chair - all the MacLeod fangs survive and my two lonely fillings have been deftly maintained since the Callaghan administration. One is, indeed, gold, though you'd need to be tickling my tonsils to have the chance for a glimpse: the queue to do so is oddly short. Taking care of your smile can defuse a lot of tricky situations But among the things I missed most, amidst the bemasked foggy-specs era of you-know-what half a decade ago, was the inability to lighten or defuse so many social, supermarket-aisle situations simply by beaming. I ended up hoisting my left hand in a sort of me-Tarzan-you-Jane placatory habit instead, and we were well into 2024 before I finally broke it. In September 2022, when all was over, I was briefly in sole charge of the family home in Edinburgh and an Amazon delivery dude called just half a minute before I was safely home with the Scottish Daily Mail and my lunch. I enthused. I sprinted. I gabbled. Moments later, I beheld him. I was late and he was Polish, but I raised an arm and beamed and, in an instant, our lad Zycinski glowed back in parallel ivory-castles. If you heard that wonderful What's up Doc? episode on Radio Four the other day – presented by identical twins Chris and Xand van Tulleken, still available on BBC Sounds – you will already know that smiling is a gesture both placatory and defensive. We do not usually switch on the famous grin with people we live with, or see every day. That's a realm of grunts, gurgles and downplayed chuckles. We smile for sought-after and hopeful significant others, eminent strangers, and potential foes. The gesture – not that I endorse van Tulleken evolutionary nonsense – is, like the chimpanzees recruited of yore for P G Tips ads, actually a fear-based grin. I am here, this is me, and I am no threat to you. In fact, the loveliest smile I ever saw – personally, and just for me, across St George's Gallery in Windsor Castle – was in April 2002 and from our late Queen, who for the Golden Jubilee had heroically invited the company of 500 of her best friends In the British media. An experiment she never repeated. To her, the Press was a necessary evil and, though I enjoyed banter with Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, to him we were a wholly unnecessary evil. For half a century on the throne, Elizabeth II had the daunting competition of her mother, her face blessed with a natural smile even in repose. The Queen's natural expression was earnest. Humourless. Late in life, she managed to make a joke of it. ' Oh, look, Philip, I've got my Miss Piggy face on…' But, even before she turned thirty – touring Canada and the USA as Princess Elizabeth; the Antipodes in 1953 as new-minted Queen – folk jibed at how often they beheld an unsmiling face. Even though, as she once justly protested, she would smile till it hurt. ' My mother is a star,' she once flared, around 1985. ' My daughter-in-law is a star. What does that make me?'

mov_8B44D96468A85C3E9903600493ACB9AE,2025-06-26 17:56:33,en,WEB,"  Bill Winters, CEO of Standard Chartered, believes his Wharton MBA was 'a waste of time' By almost any account, Bill Winters has had a very successful career. After earning his MBA from Wharton in 1988, during the peak of MBA popularity when the degree's ROI was at its highest, Winters returned to JPMorgan to continue his role in the firm's graduate trainee program. He climbed the ranks over the next 26 years, ultimately becoming co-CEO of JP Morgan's investment bank. For the past decade, Winters has been CEO of Standard Chartered Bank in the United Kingdom, receiving a total compensation package of $14.7 million last year. His net worth has been estimated as high as $336 million. Did his MBA training at Wharton helped to put him on this high-flying trajectory? Not, according to Winters. In a recent interview with Bloomberg, Winters claims his MBA degree had little to no value. It was, in his own words, “a waste of time.” VALUE OF AN MBA: NOT MUCH ACCORDING TO THIS CEO Far more helpful, he suggested, was his 1983 undergraduate degree in international relations from Colgate University, a degree that opened the door to JPMorgan in the first place. “I studied international relations and history,” he told Bloomberg. “I got an MBA later, but that was a waste of time,” It is a stunning admission from one of Wharton's most successful alums. When Winters graduated from the school in 1988, the MBA program was ranked fourth best in  's first MBA ranking. The annual tuition was just $15,440, and the typical Wharton MBA started with average pay of  $55,183. Today, tuition and fees are $92,820 a year, six times more, while the median salary is $175,000, little more than three times higher. OUSTED FROM JPMORGAN BY A HARVARD MBA Because Winters returned to JPMorgan after getting his MBA, it's highly likely he didn't even have to pay for it. JPMorgan would have picked up the tab. It's not clear why Winters is so down on his MBA degree. The Bloomberg interviewer did not follow up to explore why he thinks so little of his MBA education. Despite having a successful career, however, Wharton has never publicly acknowledged Winters with any honor or award–not a Distinguished Service Award or the Dean's Medal. And then there was the temporary setback in his career caused when JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon ousted Winters from his job as co-head of investment banking in 2009. Dimon, one of Harvard Business School's most successful MBA graduates, removed Winters abruptly by phone. SKILLS LEARNED DURING HIS HUMANITIES DEGREE MORE USEFUL Winters did say that the soft skills he learned from majoring in the humanities are more relevant now. “I learned how to think at university, and for the 40 years since I left university, those skills have been degraded, degraded, degraded. They're coming back now,” Winters said."

An array of toothpaste, toothbrushes, and mouthwashes on a bright background, highlighting the company's oral care products. Becoming the world's most chosen personal care brand is no small feat. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is present in over half of all households globally, which reflects strong leadership, a deep understanding of consumers, and steady investment in innovation and branding. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) has carefully built its flagship Colgate brand since the early 1800s, transforming it from a simple dental powder into a global leader in oral care, now available in more than 200 countries. The brand is backed by solid research and development and offers a wide range of products. Colgate holds a 20 percent share of the global toothpaste market, which grew at an average rate of 5 percent annually from 2009 to 2023. That makes it 2.5 times larger than its closest competitor. Its dominance is even stronger in some regions, with about 53 percent market share in Australia and 77 percent in Mexico. Oral care contributes roughly half of Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL)'s $20 billion in global revenue, making the Colgate brand the core of the company's competitive strength. After past underinvestment, the company has boosted marketing and innovation, launching new products like whitening pens, which have reignited growth. With solid retail ties and ongoing investment, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is well-positioned to adapt to changing consumer needs and continue delivering value. In addition, the company is a strong dividend payer, having raised its payouts for 62 consecutive years. It has never missed a dividend since 1895. It offers a quarterly dividend of $0.52 per share and has a dividend yield of 2.36%, as of June 24. While we acknowledge the potential of CL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

I lived in Wallisellen and St Gallen and rent is extremely cheap in comparison. Even buying a private property outright seems pretty cheap compared to Singapore. The advantage is Singapore has good online shopping, shopee and grab sometimes have good pickup deals for food. Lazada has red mart with a good international selection for groceries. I recently switch to using Pinduoduo as things are half price or less that of Shopee and use it to get the same brands like Colgate, Dove (soap) and other stuff but the interface is in chinese.

mov_D5B2E7D2E2A59157FF10A65A64956D44,2025-06-29 18:24:06,en,WEB,"  Podcast advertising saw a notable spike in May, with BetterHelp leading all advertisers in monthly spend – a move that coincided with Mental Health Awareness Month. According to new data from Magellan AI, the online therapy platform spent $5.82 million, targeting listeners primarily through comedy content. The surge in spend aligns with a broader industry trend of using timely awareness campaigns to drive brand engagement across audio platforms. Amazon and Unilever followed closely behind with $5.77 million and $5.14 million in spending, respectively, rounding out the top three. Most top 10 advertisers in May increased their spend over April, with notable growth from Shopify, Toyota, and State Farm. However, DraftKings and Quince pulled back. Sports remained the dominant podcast genre, drawing ad dollars from brands such as FanDuel, Toyota, and T-Mobile, while Quince joined BetterHelp in investments in comedy and society & culture programming. On the “Top Movers & Shakers” list, McDonald's made the largest month-over-month gain, increasing its podcast ad spend 333% to $2.65 million. St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, Colgate, AbbVie, and Ticketmaster also posted sharp increases, signaling growing brand interest in leveraging podcasts for scaled, high-intent reach. Share via"

n0kg8od,2025-06-30 12:40:14,en,REDDIT,"  I'm in the middle of writing a book about marketing and this is a question I think about often. My fundamental hypothesis is that building a long term emotional connection to a brand is more cost effective than short term activities e.g. like buying ads, offering discounts. It's hard to pick just one so, I'll list a few very different brands I've been thinking about and share why I feel emotionally connected to them. **Sensodyne** - Toothpaste Growing up Mum used Sensodyne because she had sensitive teeth. It was a soft pink colour and I always associated it with her. I must have inherited the same dental sensitivity, so when I left home began buying Sensodyne. Over the years their product range has changed more towards strengthening and whitening, but it retains a less flashy aesthetic compared to brands like Colgate and Crest. **Apple** Our family bought a Mac in 1991 and growing up I was the only kid at school who had an Apple Mac at home. Without many games I used the design software to do my homework. I learned about the story behind Apple and attended a MacWorld conference in London with my Mum. We've remained an Apple household and I resonate strongly with many of the modern brand values (e.g. privacy). I don't consider myself a fanboy, but I do appreciate the seamlessness of the ecosystem e.g. being able to copy/paste between devices and seamless photo sharing within out family. **Specialized** - Bicycle Manufacturer I got into mountain biking in the early 90s. As a teenager Specialized was out of my price range, but they were often ridden by my favourite riders and even sponsored Team Mountain Biking UK. When I got into road cycling I bought a $1,000 Specialized cyclocross bike and despite weighing 12kg it was fast enough to get me hooked. Within 18 months I upgrade to a carbon fibre Roubaix and I've now owned 6 Specialized road bikes, 4 of them flagship S-WORKS models. I like seeing the research and development that goes into developing bikes highly adapted to their purpose. I like having a direct connection to the brand through their owned retail stores and the peace of mind that most places I fly in the world will have a Specialized store. On multiple occasions I've had a problem and almost always received great support which has allowed me to get back riding quickly. **Boots** - UK Health & Beauty Retailer This one is more bittersweet. Since I was young we always went to boots to collect prescriptions, buy toiletries and get camera films developed. On a high street, I still gravitate towards a Boots store even though cheaper options are probably available. Despite it being owned by Walgreens and listed on the NASDAQ, I still think of it as an institution of the British high street. In recent years I've actively tried to buy from Boots instead of Amazon or other online retailers, but the company feels so behind the times. Their digital touch points are chronically bad to the point of being almost unusable and many of their stores feel tired and dated."

And I don't think crypto separates us from anything, if anything, it makes us beholden to whoever owns the largest amount of coin. At least when the US imperial ass kills peolle and controls the standard of trade, our poorest are still in the top 30% of living standard globally. Also, the fed sucks, but at LEAST they're the smartest people in the room. If anything, and this may be insane, if the Fed offered free accounts to all Americans, the big banks would have to appeal to us, like no fees, lower credit card rates, etc. they'd have to actually COMPETE for business. Like cell phones. Mint mobile comes out, Super cheap, proving cell costs are a fucking lie, and a big org immediately buys them. Like Colgate owning vertical integration on toothpaste, or Costco selling similac as Kirkland brand for 1/3 the cost. It's all a show. The fed will not be ended, ever, because it outs dimbasses back in control. They're doing Bitcoin for a very clear and obvious reason IMO. When we went off gold standard, it was because we couldn't pay back our debts in gold, so we told countries we'll pay you in dollars or we won't pay you at all. They then got to decide what a dollar is worth, and forced the world to use it. And yet, that was essentially (Nixon and Reagan) the fall of the American middle class, because the dollars worth became “worth less” and we started shipping manufacturing off shore with the idea we'd get smarter and better and everyone would have easier office jobs with AC. And yet, classic politics, they laid out NO plan to actually upskill anyone, so instead, we got a McDonald's on every street and a 30 year 7.25 minimum wage. We want Bitcoin because - well, one, bribes for Trump. And two, we are debt fucked, so we'll have our elites who own large chunks of bitcoin spike the price, pay countries in bitcoin, then tank the shit and we're back to the dollar again"

mov_DE096A83090E07226C331C6359371486,2025-06-30 16:50:35,en,WEB,"  CAZENOVIA — The Cazenovia Public Library & Museum (CPL) will host two book talks in the community room in July. “History buffs will love both these talks,” said CPL Adult Programming and Service Coordinator Renee Joseph. On July 15 at 6 p.m., Cazenovia author Maureen Sullivan will discuss “Dear Brother.” The book shares the story of Stephen and Hannah McOmber and their nine children, as told through their letters spanning 72 years from 1851 to 1923. “Their stories are personal, yet universal,” Sullivan's website states. “Individually, the letters reveal the experiences, thoughts, and feelings of the writer; collectively, they offer a time capsule of sorts, offering insights into the social history of pre-Civil War America to the early 20th century.” The book is structured mostly chronologically but also by topic, with chapters such as “Leaving Home,” “Civil War,” “Friends,” “Free Silver,” and “Enid, Oklahoma.” “With each letter that I read, I wanted to know more, and the only way to make sense of them was to transcribe them and arrange them chronologically, and in time, chapters made sense,” said Sullivan. Most of the featured letters — those addressed as “Dear Brother” — were written to and collected by Edmund McOmber, the great-great-grandfather of Sullivan's husband, Peter Tonetti, whose family home was in Waterville, NY. The collection, known in the family as the “Civil War letters,” was passed down and saved by Tonetti's grandmother, Mildred Kellogg, who lived in the same house Edmund built in Black River, NY. Edmund died at the age of 95 in Black River in 1924, and Kellogg died in 1990 at the age of 96. “From time to time, someone might casually mention these 'Civil War letters,' but what they contained and who had written them remained unclear,” Sullivan wrote in her book's introduction. “One day, interested in learning more, I asked my mother-in-law about them. She handed me a cardboard box filled with old letters. As I began to sort through and read them, it became apparent that this box of letters contained far more than letters written by brother soldiers who served together in the Union's Army of the Potomac.” Sullivan noted that she knew little about the McOmber family when she began reading, but each letter revealed a bit more about Edmund, his family, his neighbors, and his friends. “I was intrigued by the sketches of Civil War camps that brother George included in his letters home,” the introduction says. “I wished to know more about the young Theodore who wanted new boots for the upcoming Independence Day celebrations, but who didn't have [enough money] to buy them. I wondered if Edmund's sister Hank would end up marrying the man she wished her brother to meet, and I was eager to know more about that spirited girl named Nettie who wrote that she was 'mad as a hen' at her brother for not coming home for a visit. At one point, I gasped out loud when a lock of chestnut brown hair fell into my lap upon opening one of the envelopes.” Sullivan grew up in upstate New York and began her college experience at Cazenovia College before moving to New York City, where she continued her studies and earned bachelor's and master's degrees from New York University's Stern School of Business. After a 25-year career in finance, she earned an additional master's degree in teaching from Manhattanville College and is now a certified pre-k through 6th-grade teacher in New York State. Before releasing Dear Brother, Sullivan published a book titled “Simply Growing Up: Stories of Family and of Life Growing Up on a Farm.” Both books are available through Amazon and links on her website, mjsdearbrother.com. Copies of Dear Brother will also be available for purchase at the July 15 event. “Angels of Bastogne” Book Talk On July 30 at 6 p.m., North Syracuse native Glenn Ivers will discuss his book “Angels of Bastogne, a Remembrance of World War II.” Based on a true story, the book follows US Army doctor Jack Prior, M.D., and two heroic Belgian nurses, Augusta Chiwy and Renee Lemaire, who volunteered in his aid station in Bastogne, Belgium, which was bombed on Christmas Eve, 1944. It is also the story of soldiers and civilians swept up in the struggle for control of the strategic town during the Battle of the Bulge, and of the veterans who reunited in Bastogne 50 years later to reminisce and remember fallen comrades. Ivers graduated from Colgate University in 1973 with a degree in English literature. He served in the US Peace Corps in Liberia, West Africa, from 1974 to 1976, and he traveled extensively throughout West Africa after completing his service. Ivers spent his professional career in the human services field in Central New York. During the 1990s, he produced three one-hour Telly Award-winning documentary films that were distributed by the Public Broadcasting Service. Angels of Bastogne is his first book-length publication. According to Ivers' website, he was the executive director of the American Lung Association of CNY during the same period that Prior served on its board of directors. “I was inspired to write Angels of Bastogne after Dr. Jack Prior told me his extraordinary World War II story in 2002 and gave me a copy of an article he wrote about it in the Onondaga Medical Society newsletter in 1972,” Ivers said. “It was a long, arduous process, but I finally published the book in 2022.” To learn more about the context in which the story occurred, Ivers first read Charles MacDonald's “A Time for Trumpets: The Untold Story of the Battle of the Bulge,” in which Prior is quoted twice. He then read dozens of other books and articles and travelled to Bastogne in 2014. He recently returned to Bastogne in May. According to his website, Ivers planned to produce a documentary film about Prior revisiting Bastogne; unfortunately, Prior's health declined before the project could get off the ground, and he passed away in 2007. Ivers documented his writing process in “Author's Journey to Bastogne” on his website. “There are all sorts of terms for books that blend fact with fiction, but I prefer narrative nonfiction,” he said. “The book is based on Jack's actual experiences and follows the historical timeline. The dilemma for me was that, other than a few short conversations, there is no record of what any of the people said to each other. So, I added virtually all the dialogue. In essence, the characters — some real and some imagined — 'narrate' history.” To purchase and learn more about the book, visit angelsofbastogne.com."

Things like Apple or Windows or Amazon being brands is a pretty recent development, and in the case of Apple, the name was pretty heavily scrutinized at the time of its founding. These brand names are probably more a result of how long capitalism has had to mature in America; give Eastern Europe long enough to move away from the utilitarian naming conventions of communism and you'll end up with more nouns as brands in the coming decades."

Ahora se dio a conocer que Colgate-Palmolive retiró del mercado una de sus cremas dentales tras denuncias por lesiones en boca y labios. Los retiros conocidos como product recalls, se trata cuando un lote de alimentos, bebidas, medicamentos, juguetes o electrónicos se retira por mala calidad o riesgos a la salud, el impacto va mucho más allá de la pérdida económica para las empresas pone a prueba la confianza de los consumidores y la capacidad de respuesta de toda la cadena de valor. En ese sentido, para los consumidores, estos retiros pueden traducirse en un riesgo directo para la salud y la seguridad de sus familias. Según un informe de la Organización Mundial de la Salud, más de 600 millones de personas en el mundo sufren enfermedades relacionadas con alimentos contaminados cada año, lo que hace evidente la importancia de sistemas de control y respuesta eficientes. Y es que tan solo en 2024, en México la Procuraduría Federal del Consumidor (Profeco) reportó más de 150 retiros de productos, una cifra que, de acuerdo con expertos en derecho del consumo, refleja un aumento del 20 por ciento respecto a 2023. Las causas principales: contaminación cruzada en alimentos, fallas mecánicas en electrodomésticos, presencia de sustancias tóxicas no declaradas en cosméticos y defectos de fabricación en artículos infantiles. Crema dental de Colgate retirada del mercado La reputación de una de las marcas más confiables en el sector de higiene bucal enfrenta un duro golpe en Brasil. La multinacional Colgate-Palmolive decidió descontinuar de manera definitiva su crema dental Colgate Total Active Prevention Clean Mint tras una ola de reportes de efectos adversos que puso en alerta a consumidores y autoridades sanitarias. De acuerdo con un comunicado oficial publicado el 26 de junio en su página web, la compañía anunció el cese de producción de este producto en respuesta a una alerta emitida por la Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria (Anvisa), la autoridad reguladora brasileña, que desde marzo de este año prohibió su comercialización debido a múltiples quejas. Foto: Sitio web de Colgate Brasil La controversia surgió cuando, hasta finales de mayo, más de mil 200 personas reportaron reacciones adversas tras utilizar esta pasta dental, según medios internacionales. Entre los principales efectos denunciados se encuentran lesiones orales, ardor, inflamación gingival, hinchazón de labios y dolor persistente. A estos reportes se suman miles de quejas registradas en el sitio brasileño Reclame Aquí, plataforma que concentra denuncias de consumidores insatisfechos. Asimismo, se dio a conocer que Anvisa detalló que estos problemas de salud bucal tuvieron un impacto directo en la calidad de vida de los usuarios, generando desde gastos médicos y ausencias laborales, hasta dificultades para comer, hablar y un profundo malestar emocional. La gravedad de estos reportes motivó la prohibición de venta del producto el pasado 27 de marzo. Aunque Colgate-Palmolive apeló la resolución y logró una suspensión temporal de la medida, la agencia reafirmó la restricción a finales de abril al constatar que las denuncias persistían. La empresa insiste en que la pasta dental “no presenta problemas de calidad”, pero reconoce que la fórmula introducida en julio de 2024 —que sustituyó el fluoruro de sodio por fluoruro de estaño como ingrediente activo— podría estar relacionada indirectamente con los efectos adversos. No obstante, la hipótesis más fuerte apunta a los saborizantes a base de aceites esenciales incluidos en la receta, conocidos por su potencial alergénico, así como a los colorantes y aditivos presentes. Actualmente, la compañía continúa investigando estos componentes, pero optó por retirar el producto de forma definitiva como medida de prevención y para proteger la confianza del consumidor, uno de sus activos más valiosos. Esta situación sólo se está registrando en Brasil, donde muchos medios internacionales han tocado el tema difundiendoló. Y es así como este caso pone sobre la mesa un tema clave para la industria de consumo masivo: la responsabilidad de las empresas frente a la salud pública. Los retiros de productos no solo implican pérdidas millonarias por devoluciones, compensaciones y litigios, sino también un daño reputacional que puede tardar años en repararse. Además, evidencia la necesidad de fortalecer los controles regulatorios, garantizar la transparencia y dar seguimiento riguroso a nuevas formulaciones, especialmente cuando involucran ingredientes con historial de posibles reacciones adversas. Un ejemplo lo vimos en diciembre del 2024 cuando se dio a conocer que están retirando del mercado bolsas de papas fritas clásicas Lay's debido a los temores de que “puedan contener leche no declarada” que puede representar un “riesgo de reacción alérgica grave o potencialmente mortal” para los consumidores, según la Administración de Alimentos y Medicamentos. El retiro del producto afectó a las bolsas de papas fritas que se distribuyen a minoristas en los estados de Oregon y Washington, según la FDA. Ahora lee: USPS launches SpongeBob SquarePants stamps!

mov_AF360FE5ED913DC32028CCEE139BC05A,2025-06-30 22:15:32,en,WEB,"  Mark Few and the Gonzaga Bulldogs made a big splash on Monday, landing a commitment from 6'4 Spanish guard Mario Saint-Supery for the 2025-26 season. Saint-Supery has been linked to Gonzaga for over two months, and his arrival in Spokane for Hoopfest over the weekend all but solidified his commitment, even before Gonzaga's press release announcing the signing. The 6'4 guard is the latest in a long line of high profile international additions for Gonzaga, which includes Rui Hachimura, Filip Petrusev, Domantas Sabonis, Przemek Karnowski, Killian Tillie, Joel Ayayi, and Ronny Turiaf among others. Saint-Supery gives Gonzaga another ball-handler to join a new look backcourt that includes Colgate transfer Braeden Smith, Arizona State transfer Adam Miller, Grand Canyon transfer Tyon-Grant Foster, as well as returners Emmanuel Innocenti and Steele Venters. Below is a look at Gonzaga's projected starting lineup and rotation with the team's roster very likely set ahead of the 2025-26 season: Projected Starting Lineup C: Graham Ike (17.3 PPG last year) PF: Braden Huff (11 PPG last year) SF: Tyon Grant-Foster (14.8 PPG last year at Grand Canyon) SG: Adam Miller (9.8 PPG last year at Arizona State) PG: Braeden Smith (12.5 PPG in 2023-24 at Colgate) The pairing of Ike and Huff in the starting lineup didn't happen until the final three games of Gonzaga's season, but it worked beautifully. It was done first as a way to counter the size of Saint Mary's in the WCC championship, which resulted in a big win for the Zags. The team deployed the lineup again in a blowout win over Georgia in the first round of the NCAA Tournament, and once more in the team's season-ending loss to eventual runner-up Houston. There's no reason these two won't start together again this upcoming season. Grant-Foster didn't perform quite as well last year as he did in his first season at Grand Canyon, when he was named WAC Player of the Year after averaging 20.1 points and 6.1 rebounds, but an early season ankle injury likely had a lot to do with that. For Gonzaga he will slide in nicely into the role filled by Khalif Battle last year as a driving wing who puts pressure on the rim, generates points from the free throw line, and impacts the game defensively with his length and veteran experience. Miller is a well-travelled guard who spent time at Illinois, LSU, and most recently Arizona State, where he averaged 9.8 points while shooting 42.9% from three last year for the Sun Devils. His history as an outside shooter is a bit spotty, but he's always been a good scorer and should fit nicely as a veteran addition for the Zags backcourt. Smith spent last year redshirting as the point guard in waiting behind Nembhard, and the Colgate transfer who averaged 12.5 points and 5.6 assists while winning Patriot League Player of the Year will be an outstanding replacement at the one. Bench/Rotation 6'7 wing Jalen Warley (7.5 PPG in 2023-24 at Florida State) 6'7 wing Steele Venters (15.3 PPG in 2022-23 at Eastern Washington) 6'4 guard Mario Saint-Supery (6.3 PPG with BAXI Manresa in Spain) 6'5 guard Emmanuel Innocenti (1.7 PPG last year) 7'0 center Ismaila Diagne (3.4 PPG last year) 6'7 wing Davis Fogle (No. 32 in ESPN Top 100 for 2025 class) 6'10 center Parker Jefferson (No. 164 in 247Sports Composite Rankings for 2025 class) Warley is a point forward type who doesn't do a ton of scoring but is a great facilitator and defender, using his disruptive length and high basketball IQ to make plays. If Steele Venters is healthy the sharpshooter could be a perfect 'addition' to the Zags, after he agonizingly sat two consecutive seasons with knee and foot injuries, respectively. Saint-Supery has extremely high upside, but as an international freshman who didn't arrive in Spokane until late June it's unlikely he plays a big role for the Zags right away. As the year goes on the 6'4 guard - who has been likened to Ricky Rubio for his creative passing and fluidity - could start to push for more time on the floor and it wouldn't be a surprise if he's a huge part of the team in 2026-27. Innocenti is very similar stylistically to Warley and best served as a key bench piece for coach Few and the Zags. He provides tenacious on-ball defense and while his offensive game is still developing, the potential is there. Speaking of potential, Diagne showcased incredible upside against Santa Clara late in the regular season, and his tremendous athleticism and size make him an extremely tantalizing piece of this roster, and one who should see more playing time as a sophomore behind the two starting bigs. Fogle is from Anacortes, WA and grew from 6'2 to 6'7 while in high school which ballooned his stock from unheralded high schooler to top 50 prospect. The addition of Grant-Foster could push Fogle into a redshirt situation if he is willing, because the path to playing time in year one is quite blocked. Jefferson is a mobile big man prospect with plus floor vision, soft hands, and good footwork around the rim. In other words, the exact type of player Gonzaga has developed extremely well in coach Few's soon-to-be Hall of Fame tenure in Spokane. He's likely a bit player this season, if he doesn't redshirt, but if he puts his time in he could be a future star in Spokane. What's Next Adding Miller and Jefferson filled two key holes for Gonzaga, and Grant-Foster gives them much-needed scoring punch in the backcourt. The final need for the Zags was a young backup point guard, and with Saint-Supery now in the mix it seems quite likely the Bulldogs are done making roster additions for the upcoming season.

Segundo a autarquia, ambas mantiveram a oferta do serviço de mototáxi na capital paulista, mesmo com a proibição em vigor determinada pela Justiça. O Procon aplicou multa de R$ 13.791.524,54 à Uber e de R$ 3.533.836 à 99. O órgão baseou as sanções no artigo 14 do Código de Defesa do Consumidor, e as plataformas ainda podem contestar os valores. + Leia mais notícias de Brasil em Oeste Atendendo a um pedido da prefeitura, o Tribunal de Justiça de São Paulo vetou o serviço. Ainda assim, as empresas mantiveram a oferta de corridas com motocicletas. “O arcabouço legal garante ampla defesa, mas sempre a partir do cumprimento de decisão judicial, ainda mais advinda do Tribunal de Justiça”, disse Luiz Orsatti Filho, diretor-executivo do Procon de São Paulo. “Portanto, o argumento das empresas de que mantêm o serviço enquanto aguardam esclarecimentos não é justificável.” Uber enfrenta veto e aguarda decisão sobre mototáxi A polêmica se arrasta desde 2023, quando a Prefeitura de São Paulo publicou um decreto para proibir a modalidade. O principal argumento é a segurança dos passageiros. No entanto, Uber e 99 retomaram brevemente o serviço em maio, sob a alegação de que poderiam operar até a regulamentação definitiva. + Leia também: “Queixas por alergia aumentam, e Colgate para de vender marca de creme dental” Em meio ao conflito judicial, o governador Tarcísio de Freitas (Republicanos) sancionou, em 24 de junho, uma lei estadual que transfere para os municípios a decisão sobre liberar ou vetar mototáxis por aplicativos. Na capital, o serviço continua proibido, e atualmente está indisponível nos aplicativos das duas empresas."

n0omv3a,2025-07-01 01:32:52,en,REDDIT,"  I loved Bertha at the beginning of the series. I love how she started off as the ""new money"" underdog that was mistreated by ""old money"" society, and she ended up overcoming all of it. I rooted for her during season's 1 & 2 because she was the hero of her own story. And I still think she's interesting but it's really something to see her entering this villain era. And rest assured, she is being a villain. With the way she's forcing Gladys into a marriage that she doesn't want, essentially seeing Gladys as a pawn for even more success. She showed that several times in this episode. When she found out Gladys ran off, her first concern wasn't for Gladys's safety, she wondered if she had eloped. Later when she was talking to George about everything, she put her daughter in the category of a business transaction. And, during Mrs. Fane's party when Mrs. Fish asked her, what do you call the mother of a Duchess, Bertha was beaming from ear to ear with a Colgate commercial smile. Not to mention her very obviously leaking Gladys's engagement to the Duke in the papers with noone knowing about it & threatening to disinherit Gladys if she has the nerve to choose to marry a man she loves. I think Big Bertha only uses her ""best intentions"" for her daughter as a rationalization. She sees Gladys as an extension of herself rather than her own person & a means to stay at the very head of the same society that shunned her at first. Shameful."

In cases of fraud, most offenders were experienced professionals: 96% in healthcare, 88% in financial services, and 79% in IT/ITeS had already spent a few years in the workforce. The study is based on an analysis of over 1 million background pre-employment screening conducted across more than 90 mid- to large-sized organizations. As technology permeates every aspect of our lives, the risks that come with it are evolving equally rapidly. From resume fraud and submission of fake job documents to dual employment, and the use of deepfakes for virtual interviews-digital hiring risks are challenging HR professionals to find ways to maintain workforce integrity while hiring talent. Arpinder Singh, Global Markets and India Leader, Forensic and Integrity Services, EY said, ""Employment fraud has been a longstanding menace in India. To tackle this, today, employee background checks have become a non-negotiable across sectors. As we rapidly adopt technology in the workplace, the risks associated with it are evolving equally fast. HR professionals are struggling to keep up with the changing landscape of hiring frauds in India. While technology poses challenges, it is also the solution to this issue. Technology-led background verification solutions help organisations with insightful and accurate reports for better decision making and significantly reduced turnaround time.""

In a reflection on the dehumanisation of immigrants in the United States (based on horrifying images emerging from prisons in El Salvador), every man will wear a T-shirt created in partnership with the American Civil Liberties Union. 25Willy Chavarria Spring/Summer 2026 Chavarria spoke to the models: “We're going to deliver a very strong message about the erasing of people,” he began. “The name of the show is Huron, which is the name of the town I grew up in, in California. And right now, as we speak, my town Huron is being attacked by ICE.” His voice broke. “People are being taken away and put in prison. What we're representing here are the Brown and Black people, taken from their families.” Four hours later, those men would be kneeling, dressed in white, in a single row, heads bowed. As an image, it resonated wide – it was also heartfelt, and brave. As is well-known, speaking up against the Trump administration can have repercussions for US citizens and visitors alike. But, in Chavarria's own words. “It's always important for me to speak about what's happening … Everything we do, whether we want it to be or not, is political.” That said, this collection was not, aesthetically, dark. Rather, it popped with saturated colour – spearmint, thick yolky yellow, a socking cobalt under the sloping, graphic brims of traditional black Cordovan hats. The hues, Chavarria said, came from the humble uniforms of warehouse and factory workers from around the world – Colgate green, Amazon blue, the scarlet of Coca-Cola co. Willy Chavarria Spring/Summer 2026Photography by Harry MillerWilly Chavarria Spring/Summer 2026Photography by Harry Miller Here, they were elevated to high fashion, executed in deluxe, Italian-milled fabrics , whether a simple cotton or a blistered metallic cloqué which, Chavarria said, was very “Carol Burnett … a bit Liz Taylor”. Indeed, there was a slant of mid-century couture to these clothes – albeit via Palm Beach, with big Deeda Blair blow-outs over to a trio of ballooning gowns in Ikea blue, yellow and a hot spanked pink, and a slithery column with a pouched coccyx in a warty puce. But the same feeling could be eked out of a polo shirt, or bomber with cocooning back. Where did the impetus for all that colour come from? “It started in a very superficial way,” Chavarria reasoned. “I want to do joy this season. I wanted to turn the tables. That was five months ago, six months ago. And as things progressed … the idea of what this joy means transformed. Now, what this joy is, is endurance. A sign of endurance, a sign of hope, a sign of rebellion.” And for me, in Chavarria's generous, joyous tailoring for men and women, there were unmistakable nods to zoot suits, the brightly-coloured, dandyish tailoring that Black and Hispanic youths wore as a form of protest through extravagance in the 1940s. They elicited violent reactions, too: in June 1943, in Chavarria's home state of California, what became known as the Zoot Suit Riots broke out, with American servicemen attacking young Latino and Mexican Americans. They stripped them of their zoot suits, ostensibly because they considered their profligate use of fabric unpatriotic against the backdrop of wartime rationing. In fact, of course, it was racially motivated violence, tinged with fear and loathing. History, it seems is repeating itself. Willy Chavarria Spring/Summer 2026Photography by Harry MillerWilly Chavarria Spring/Summer 2026Photography by Harry Miller Why did those suits excite rage? Because they refused to be silenced. They were about fighting erasure, about emphasising presence, about pride. They seem as prescient of now as they were of then."

Conozca la lista completa y qué respondió la empresa sobre esta situación La multinacional Colgate-Palmolive luego de recibir múltiples denuncias sobre lesiones en boca, labios y encías, según informó la Agencia Nacional de Vigilancia Sanitaria de Brasil (Anvisa). La medida fue tomada el 27 de marzo de 2025 como una acción preventiva tras reportes de efectos adversos por parte de consumidores. ¿Cuáles son los ingredientes que contiene este producto? Según el sitio oficial de Colgate y la tienda verificada de Amazon, los ingredientes de esta crema dental son: - Ingrediente activo: ​Fluoruro estañoso 0.454 % (equivalente a 0.15 % de ion flúor). - Otros ingredientes: ​Sorbitol, agua, sílice hidratada, glicerina, saborizantes (menta), lauril sulfato de sodio, pirofosfato tetrapotásico, goma de celulosa, nitrato de potasio, sacarina sódica, goma xantana, betaína de cocamidopropilo y dióxido de titanio. La combinación de flúor con agentes limpiadores como el lauril sulfato de sodio podría intensificar los efectos en mucosas sensibles, según publicaciones revisadas en PubMed sobre irritación oral relacionada con dentífricos. Usuarios denunciaron casos de ardor, úlceras, inflamación, ampollas y sensibilidad extrema tras usar la pasta, según comunicados de Anvisa. El componente señalado como posible causante es el flúor estañoso (stannous fluoride), un agente antibacterial que, aunque eficaz, puede provocar reacciones irritativas en ciertas personas. La fórmula mejorada con fluoruro estañoso fue lanzada para ofrecer mayor protección contra la placa y las encías sensibles, pero no todos los organismos reaccionan favorablemente a este ingrediente, sobre todo en personas con predisposición a reacciones bucales. Qué dice la ciencia sobre el flúor estañoso El fluoruro estañoso ha sido respaldado por la Asociación Dental Americana (ADA) por su efectividad contra la caries y la gingivitis. Sin embargo, estudios como el publicado en el International Dental Journal (2021) advierten que puede producir reacciones adversas en tejidos blandos de la cavidad oral si no se formula adecuadamente. En ciertos pacientes, el flúor estañoso también ha sido asociado con alteraciones del gusto, sensación de ardor e hipersensibilidad en lengua y encías, sobre todo si el producto contiene aditivos que refuercen su efecto químico. Colgate asegura que el producto es seguro La empresa Colgate-Palmolive indicó que su fórmula cumple con estándares internacionales de seguridad, y que los reportes son casos aislados de sensibilidad individual. Sin embargo, la compañía decidió retirar el producto para no comprometer la confianza de los consumidores mientras se investigan los casos reportados. ""Nos tomamos en serio todas las denuncias y actuamos de forma preventiva mientras evaluamos los componentes involucrados"", expresó la firma en un comunicado difundido en medios brasileños."

So, im 17, a few years back (2022-early 2024) i struggled really badly with my mental health and bodily image, (Im trans MtF) and i ended up developing bulimia and struggled a lot with upkeeping personal hygiene, (just over a year clean from bulimia now and doing a lot better mostly), I got referred for a root canal about 2 years ago and completed it 6 months back, and since i have been taking extra good care of my teeth, (brushing twice sometimes 3 times daily, with colgate and an electric toothbrush, flossing every evening etc) and i have the 6 month checkup in a few days, and i am PETRIFIED. I initially got it done as i had a spot on the gum that kept draining then coming back. I got the root canal, then a crown fitted, and i havent experienced any symptoms (no drainage, no swelling, no new spot, no sensetivity, etc) however during anxiety episodes the last few weeks, ive had a very light dull ache in my mouth, at random spots in my mouth, which goes away when i am not thinking about it. I know its realistically anxiety, and i have had a history of physical anxiety symptoms (Ill hyperfixate on an illness, say a heart attack, and when i worry about it a lot i end up with chest pains etc) , it should be fine the success rates are so high, but the idea of having to have another 2 long appointments terrifies me, i have really bad hypochondria, im scared of needles, i struggle sitting still for long periods. the stress has brought me to a point where i am constantly worrying, its next tuesday the checkup. This is so obviously anxiety part of me thinks, but can someone please just confirm itll be okay? I am so scared its horrible. Any reply is really really appreciated and remove if this isnt okay<33"

So, im 17, a few years back (2022-early 2024) i struggled really badly with my mental health and bodily image, (Im trans MtF) and i ended up developing bulimia and struggled a lot with upkeeping personal hygiene, (just over a year clean from bulimia now and doing a lot better mostly), I got referred for a root canal about 2 years ago and completed it 6 months back, and since i have been taking extra good care of my teeth, (brushing twice sometimes 3 times daily, with colgate and an electric toothbrush, flossing every evening etc) and i have the 6 month checkup in a few days, and i am PETRIFIED. I initially got it done as i had a spot on the gum that kept draining then coming back. I got the root canal, then a crown fitted, and i havent experienced any symptoms (no drainage, no swelling, no new spot, no sensetivity, etc) however during anxiety episodes the last few weeks, ive had a very light dull ache in my mouth, at random spots in my mouth, which goes away when i am not thinking about it. I know its realistically anxiety, and i have had a history of physical anxiety symptoms (Ill hyperfixate on an illness, say a heart attack, and when i worry about it a lot i end up with chest pains etc) , it should be fine the success rates are so high, but the idea of having to have another 2 long appointments terrifies me, i have really bad hypochondria, im scared of needles, i struggle sitting still for long periods. the stress has brought me to a point where i am constantly worrying, its next tuesday the checkup.

n13c3nb,2025-07-03 08:19:23,sv,REDDIT,"  SPR_COMBO[sv]Förmodar att det är nya Sensodyne Repair and protect med Novamin. De kostar ordinarie 74 kr men kan fås ibland för 40 kr på nätapotek. I mitt tycke, med blottat dentin är det värt de få tiorna per månad mot en Colgate för 15 kr. Det känns också betydligt bättre i munnen efteråt, vilket även flera av de lite dyrare 30 kr varianterna av Oral-B Pro Expert och Sensodyne Pro Emalj gör. Om det har någon verkligt påtaglig långvarig effekt för emaljen är oklart, men det är ändå ingen utgift att bråka. Om någon föredrar den och tycker den är bra, låt det vara. Tandvård är betydligt mer kostsamt och vänta tills du hör vad en flaska Kerastase hårschampo och balsam kostar 😱 Hade en diskussion med ChatGPT om Sensodyne Repair & Protect innan jag provade  själv. Sensodyne Repair & Protect med 5 % NovaMin marknadsförs som en tandkräm som kan återuppbygga emaljen och täppa till blottade dentinkanaler, vilket minskar ilningar. NovaMin är ett varumärke för bioaktivt glas (kalcium-natrium-fosfosilikat), som frisätter kalcium- och fosfationener när det kommer i kontakt med saliv. Dessa joner kan bidra till att bilda ett mineral-liknande skikt (hydroxyapatit) på tändernas yta. Vad säger forskningen? Det finns viss vetenskaplig evidens för att NovaMin kan hjälpa till att: - Minska ilningar (dentinsensitivitet). - Främja remineralisering av emaljen under vissa förhållanden. Men: Studierna varierar i kvalitet och många är finansierade av tillverkaren. Det finns inte starka, oberoende långtidsstudier som bevisar att emaljen faktiskt ""byggs upp igen"" till samma styrka som tidigare. Vanlig fluoridtandkräm (t.ex. Colgate med natriumfluorid) är mycket väldokumenterad när det gäller kariesförebyggande effekt och remineralisering. Är det värt priset? Om du lider av ilningar eller har blottlagt dentin, kan Sensodyne med NovaMin vara värd pengarna, men för en frisk person med normal emalj är skillnaden mot vanlig fluortandkräm sannolikt marginell i praktiken."

n18fzb0,2025-07-04 01:50:00,en,REDDIT,"  Someone on Reddit said when Amazon has an inventory of something, they don't check the safety/quality of the products. They just dump everything together. So let's say they have 17 Colgate toothpaste tubes and 3 knock offs. They just dump everything together and then ship it out. Even though they have 3 annoyed customers they have 17 happy ones. This model is profitable for them. So you can do your research and make sure it is a reputable brand and still end up with unsafe poorly made products. Also Amazon will make their own products based on what their competitors sell that is successful.

Whether you're navigating sandy dunes or winding through wildflower-lined mountain paths, the right footwear is essential for an enjoyable experience. To help you find the best hiking shoes for your next adventure, we spoke with outdoor enthusiasts and experienced hikers. What to Look for in Hiking Shoes Shopping for hiking shoes requires considering several key factors.” A great pair needs to be lightweight, waterproof, provide stability, and look good,” says Alison F. Heisler,hiking enthusiast,former D1 lacrosse athlete at Colgate,and founding member of LaunchBreak. “It's a small detail, but the laces are critically important – they shouldn't fray and need to tighten securely. I have narrow feet, so I need to ensure my foot doesn't slip inside the boot. Also, the best boots are always aligned with the socks you plan to wear. I use lighter-weight wool socks for trekking and running socks for trail runs, so I always try boots on with my socks.” Stephanie Beale, outdoor enthusiast and owner of GoatsTrail.com, adds another pro tip: break in your shoes before hitting the trails. “I prefer to wear them around the house or in the yard for a few hours,” she explains. “I don't like to start a long hike with brand new shoes without knowing how they'll feel after extended wear. If I can comfortably wear them for a few hours during normal walking, I know they'll likely be good for a longer hike.” Now, let's explore some top-rated hiking boots and shoes, as recommended by passionate hikers. 1. Salomon X Ultra 360 Mid Gore-tex Salomon's X Ultra 360 Mid Gore-Tex is a popular choice, praised for its rugged outsole, sleek design, waterproof membrane, and comfortable fit. “This was my go-to boot for a recent 10-day trek in bolivia through the Andes mountains,” Alison shares. “The terrain was uneven and we hiked through a lot of rain. This boot kept my foot dry, and I felt extremely stable. I didn't get a single blister!” RELATED: 6 Best Walking Workouts You Can Do on Your Local Track 2. Salewa Pedroc Air The Salewa Pedroc Air offers a lightweight and breathable design specifically for female hikers.” I love these hiking shoes,” says Alison. “They excel in so many areas. I wore them almost every day during my 25-day trek to Everest Base Camp and throughout Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal.They're lightweight, below the ankle, and Grace O'Connor — Health & Science Editor Grace O'Connor ensures every medical claim is grounded in peer-reviewed research.

mov_2E707D30010FEF24F2C58DEBF9603D74,2025-07-04 22:47:00,en,WEB,"  Dartmouth College baseball coach Bob Whalen this week announced his retirement after 36 years and 653 wins, the most of any Ivy League baseball coach at a single institution. Whalen, the longest-tenured Division I head coach at one school, won 11 Ivy League Red Rolfe Division titles, two Ivy League crowns, and his teams made two NCAA Tournament appearances. Since Whalen took over, Dartmouth has had 31 Major League Baseball draft picks, with six reaching the majors. Before his arrival at Dartmouth, Whalen was an assistant at the University of Maine from 1982-89 and was promoted to associate head coach in 1987. A successor has yet to be announced. UNH soccer team to open Aug. 21 at home The UNH men's soccer team, which fell short of making the NCAA Tournament last season for the first time in nine seasons, will play Boston University on Thursday, Aug. 21 (3 p.m.) at Wildcat Stadium in its home opener, it was announced this week. The Wildcats will play a total of 16 games, split evenly between home and road. After the BU game, UNH will stay at home to face Colgate on Sunday, Aug. 24, and will then hit the road for three straight games, at St. John's, Western Michigan and UC Irvine. A highlight of the schedule is the annual Granite State battle with Dartmouth, this season on Sept. 20 in Durham. The Wildcats finished 7-3-7 last fall and won the America East regular-season championship. Vermont won the America East tournament title and eventually the national championship, 2-1 in overtime, over Marshall.

My 12 year old son is AuDHD and can't use mint because no matter how mild, it's a sensation he cannot handle. I Googled a lot a few years ago, because he also didn't care for all of the bubblgum flavors marketed to kids, and we ended up on Hello products. They have fruit flavors both with and without fluoride and we've successfully used most of them. He really likes the Mermaid (orange dreamcicle) and Dragon (blue raspberry) flavors, but grape and strawberry were well received too. They are more expensive than a tube of crest or Colgate, but to me it's more than worth it. I've gotten them from Target, Amazon, and Sam's Club."

When the Quantum Field Effect wore off, he returned — still wearing a coat and shoes given to him by John Lawrence Burns, a Civil War hero. This suggests that physical matter can move through time.

1lt2h6e,2025-07-06 14:24:41,en,REDDIT,"  Hi everyone. I've seen posts like these in this subreddit and I have noted several ways people have experimented and reduced/reversed cavities. I recently got 6 cavities filled and why they happened in the first place is because of a number of reasons - 1. genetic predisposition 2. continued use of Colgate visible white ""enamel safe"" toothpaste for a few years 2x a day (I did 2x then to improve my oral health without knowing the abrasive effects of such toothpastes 🤦🏻‍♀️) 3. pitted molars 4. a monthly sick year of 2023 (legit sick every month) could've led to immunity loss and contributed to enamel health because of low iron and b12. Recently, my mental health has turned shit and I feel I betrayed myself by doing pt.2. I am talking to a therapist aboutmy health anxiety but it's honestly pretty bad lol. I cry constantly now and feel catastrophic all the time. This teeth situation is feeding onto my low self esteem and worth. I want to know, is there anyway I can ""STRENGTHEN"" my teeth naturally, NOT NECESSARILY reverse cavities? I am shit scared of them breaking and falling off etc. and feel addressing this will tremendously help. Some things I've picked up here- 1. nanohydroxyapatit toothpaste (switched to Biomin one in Jan but will switch to this) and especially letting it sit on teeth in trays(?) Can I just spit and let it be? 2. oil pulling 3. K2 tablets? ( I get homeopathic medicine, kinda aversive to allopathy but I'm not sure my doc would rightaway tell me to take these) 4. Low sugar carbs- ironically my teeth were splendid in childhood when I wasn't brushing 2x and had a big sweet tooth but worsened when I reversed the habits lol. maybe my childhood habits caught up?? 5. brushing or rinsing after every meal (making a habit of it now) Is there anything else? I would love your help and find a way to the light"

mov_AEFB248551A03D17FC51A9B3597B02CE,2025-07-07 00:43:02,en,WEB,"  A sense of déjà vu permeates the latest report on brand trust. Morning Consult's 2025 Most Reputable Brands analysis reveals that the companies consumers rely on most today bear a striking resemblance to those favored during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. This resurgence of trust in established brands underscores a continued prioritization of safety, security, and essential needs, even as the world navigates a new normal. The report, which surveyed consumers across all demographics, highlights a consistent preference for brands associated with cleanliness, health, and reliable service. But what does this sustained loyalty tell us about the evolving consumer mindset and the enduring power of established brands in a rapidly changing world? Across all consumer touchpoints, a handful of categories consistently emerged as leaders in brand trust. These include: Home Keeping and Hygiene: Brands like Dawn, Clorox, Lysol, Mr. Clean, and Home Depot continue to be cornerstones of consumer confidence. Self- and Personal Care: Dove, Oral-B, Kleenex, and Colgate remain trusted staples in daily routines. Health: BAND-AID and Tylenol exemplify the enduring trust in brands providing essential healthcare solutions. Packages and Shipping/Ecommerce: UPS, Amazon, the United States Postal Service, and FedEx are vital for modern commerce and maintain high levels of consumer trust. And, let's not forget the comfort factor: Hershey's and M&M's demonstrate that even indulgence can be a source of reliable satisfaction. Maslow's Hierarchy and the Modern Consumer These favored brands directly address fundamental human needs, as outlined in Maslow's Hierarchy. From physiological needs (food, hygiene) to safety and security, consumers are gravitating towards brands that provide a sense of stability and well-being. This isn't simply nostalgia; it's a reflection of ongoing anxieties and a desire for predictability in an uncertain world. Deeper Dive: Trust Across Specific Verticals Morning Consult's analysis extended beyond broad categories, examining trust within specific consumer verticals. Health Sector Trust Leaders Medicines: Tylenol Health Retail: CVS Health Pharmaceuticals: Bayer Health Services: Minute Clinic at CVS Health Insurance: Blue Cross Blue Shields Personal Care Brand Leaders Personal Care: Dove Dental Care: Oral-B Skin Care: Vaseline Lip Care: ChapStick Beauty: Bath & Body Works Cosmetics: CeraVe Hair Care: Head & Shoulders Gyms: Planet Fitness Hair Services: Great Clips Fitness Equipment: NordicTrack Generational Divides in Brand Loyalty Trust isn't uniform across all age groups. Younger consumers, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, demonstrate a growing trust in social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube, while older generations tend to favor legacy brands with established reputations. This generational gap highlights the evolving role of media and marketing in shaping consumer perceptions. Adweek's analysis provides further insight into these differing perspectives. Pro Tip: Building brand trust requires consistent delivery on promises, transparent communication, and a genuine commitment to customer well-being. The Rise of Health and Sustainability Concerns Recent data from the dunnhumby Consumer Trends Tracker reinforces the growing importance of health and sustainability for U.S. consumers. Two-thirds of consumers prioritize sourcing products that align with their dietary needs, and nearly half believe retailers should actively support healthy choices. This trend extends to a preference for local businesses and products, driven by a desire for transparency and connection. As the 2025 Edelman Trust Barometer demonstrates, trust is increasingly built through local relationships rather than distant national brands. However, economic realities are also impacting consumer behavior. With potential cuts to SNAP benefits and rising food costs, one in four U.S. households, and over a third of those aged 18-34, have been forced to skip meals in the past year. This underscores the critical role of food security and the need for accessible, affordable nutrition. The growing movement towards “food as medicine” is gaining traction, recognizing that food is not merely sustenance but a fundamental component of health and well-being...."

Things that have worked for my kid include: * Pretending to be the germs in her mouth coming to eat her teeth * Encouraging her to make a toothbrushing song by opening and closing her lips slightly as she brushes (using the mouth as a resonance cavity) * Various toothbrushing songs by kids artists * Telling a story to distract her Can you find a toothpaste that has a similar flavour to the one she likes? It looks like Colgate makes a watermelon kids toothpaste."

Todd was a power broker at Cantor Fitzgerald. He was an all-American guy. Talented athlete. Graduate of Colgate University. Married six years to Megan Pezzuti. Father of two. In fact, that fateful day began with a tender phone call to his young son, as reported by the Rochester News: Two hours before the terrorist attack, Todd D. Pelino called his 2-year-old son from his office in the World Trade Center to wish him well on his first day of nursery school. The next time the Pittsford native called, he was telling his wife, Megan, that he loved her and their two young children, and he would try to get down from the 107th floor of the burning building.

mov_AF809FF346DBADB942ACEDB7FA38DD4B,2025-07-07 21:31:24,en,WEB,"  The award-winning “Magic Duos,” out of home campaign reminded people that the combination of their favourite food and an ice-cold Coca-Cola is magic. When CEO Rob Guénette stood at the helm of a newly merged VML Canada, bringing Taxi and Wunderman Thompson together, he knew the easiest route would be the wrong one. Simply fusing old cultures from the separate firms – Taxi having made its mark with influential creative and Wunderman building its reputation on CRM, commerce, data and tech – wasn't going to be enough. He wanted to build something entirely new: a fresh company that could, from day one, be a serious contender on the national stage. OLG Ontario Racing Unfiltered, a gripping docuseries, brought the raw, behind-the-scenes world of horse racing to life, helping a new audience fall in love with the sport. And in just over a year, with over 500 employees across Montréal, Toronto and Vancouver offices, the agency has done just that through deliberate leadership choices, an ambitious vision and a culture that prioritizes creativity and connection. “We established the leadership very quickly, so that set the tone,” Guénette says. And then he and Graham Lang, CCO, set one clear goal: “We have to come out of this, not only with a successful merger, but also to land in the top five most creative agencies in Canada with a body of work that represents the totality of our capabilities.” Lang highlights that VML Canada ranked fourth in the Strategy 2025 Creative Report Card. The agency now consistently tops creative industry benchmarks. But behind those wins lies a deliberate philosophy that Guénette and his team installed from the very start: a culture of creativity, connection and integration. At the heart of VML Canada's approach is the philosophy of creating “Connected Brands” – brands that meet customers with the right mix of humanity, persuasion and commerce at every stage of their journey. VML's integrated structure flows across three pillars, with Brand Experience, Customer Experience and Commerce under one roof. The company sees itself as a band of doers, innovators and believers in humanity. And for Guénette, those words are more than branding – they are the spirit behind every piece of work, whether it's a simple in-store shelf talker or a national television spot, the commitment to high creativity remains the same. “Pride Unravelled,” transformed data into a powerful visual statement and turned complex truths into an unforgettable celebration of identity and impact. VML's geographic reach is key to their success in a multicultural country like Canada. Québec isn't an afterthought, for example, it's built into every national campaign from the start. In fact, some national accounts are run entirely out of Montréal or Vancouver, reflecting the agency's inclusive model. Improv star Pier-Luc Funk electrified the screen in San Émission, the award-winning comedy special that transformed a TV station's dead airtime into a four-hour overnight hit powered by the all-electric Volkswagen. This approach has paid off, with standout campaigns like Volkswagen's “Sans Émissions” emerging from the Montréal office, which won a Grand Clio for Media. A simple but powerful double entendre, the campaign transformed Québec's TV “off-air” screens into a metaphor for Volkswagen's zero-emission vehicles, earning top global recognition and helping the automaker's electrification efforts resonate in a culturally authentic way. Other major accounts like Coca-Cola, Mazda, Fido, OLG, Vancity, Colgate and Kruger have also benefited from VML's distinctly Canadian storytelling. Guénette also explains that VML Canada negotiated significant local autonomy despite being part of the world's largest agency network, with over 30,000 employees globally. Technological innovation is also playing a part in the agency's future. Through VML's access to WPP Open, a proprietary AI-powered platform, the team can accelerate research and production without sacrificing creative quality. Though AI isn't a replacement for human insight, Guénette sees it as a powerful enabler. VML helped Coca-Cola Fuze make its Canadian debut with a bold launch campaign and introduced a fresh new brand with a familiar flavour to audiences across the country. Looking ahead, VML Canada's focus is on smart, sustainable growth. With a challenging economic landscape and uncertain global tensions, the agency is doubling down on deepening relationships with existing clients, strengthening their customer experience and commerce capabilities and applying their full creative force across every touchpoint. Ultimately, Guénette believes the balance between deep national pride and global connectedness is what sets VML Canada apart. That's why VML Canada's mantra is “Fiercely local. Proudly global.” CONTACT: Matt Shoom-Kirsch Chief operating officer matt.shoom-kirsch@vml.com The 2025 A-Listers: Intro Zulu Alpha Kilo: Connecting creativity and impact Mosaic: An era where anything's possible Agnostic: Rewriting narratives in service of the work Weber Shandwick: Where culture, creativity and tech collide Dentsu: Humanity in the age of algorithms Lifelong Crush: Sparking long-term devotion C&B Advertising: Leading with emotion PHD Canada: An intelligent transformation The Hive: Doubling down on beating boring Touché! : Flexing Canadian media muscle..."

mov_3DEB631B8BEC28DE47A629CD4B750160,2025-07-08 09:39:16,en,WEB,"  Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is one of the Best Stagflation Stocks to Buy Now. On May 28, Piper Sandler reiterated its Overweight rating on Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE: CL) and held its price target at $109, implying roughly 18% upside from current trading levels. The reaffirmation followed a private meeting with CEO Noel Wallace and Investor Relations head John Faucher, which gave the firm a closer look at the company's strategic footing. The conversation focused heavily on how Colgate is steering through the current tariff dynamics, a situation the firm believes the company is handling efficiently and with minimal disruption. Piper Sandler described Colgate as one of the more stable names within its consumer staples coverage, citing its global footprint and shareholder-focused philosophy as core strengths. The analysts came away with increased confidence in Colgate's ability to manage international complexity, maintain consistent performance, and stay aligned with its long-standing emphasis on value creation. That blend of steadiness and strategic agility is what continues to anchor their bullish view on the stock. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is a global consumer goods leader specializing in oral care, personal hygiene, and pet nutrition. With iconic brands like Colgate, Palmolive, Tom's of Maine, and Hill's Science Diet, its products remain essential even during economic slowdowns, cementing its status as a defensive staple. While we acknowledge the potential of CL as an investment, we believe certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.

n1zntqa,2025-07-08 14:21:58,en,REDDIT,"  Toothbrushes. I've used an expensive Oral-B iO, a cheap Chinese brand from Amazon, and basic non-electric brushes from Crest, Colgate, etc. The expensive Oral-B was disgusting. It had crevices that accumulated mold and slime and were impossible to clean. Lots of people online reported the same issue. It also required expensive brush head replacements every 3 months. I discarded the brush within a year because of the mold and gunk issue. The cheap electric brush had a simple design and thus was easy to clean. The brushing action was rougher compared to the expensive brush, but still good and seemed equally effective. I used it for a few years until it died. The basic brushes are trivial to clean, don't require charging, and cost maybe $10 per year for replacements. They work well enough. I use a one-touch timer on my phone to replicate the electric brushes' built-in timers. And they are easy to travel with since they don't require a charger. I don't miss electric brushes."

3ef1f00dd36250cd8f36cbd969dfb609,2025-07-08 15:36:00,ro,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[ro]Cum si de ce sa-i dai literaturii romane, o tenta optimista! Întreba cineva deunăzi, în timpul unei conversații: — Cum se face că toate nuvelele cu adevărat izbutite conțin atâta tristețe și atâta suferință, atâtea crime și atâta răutate? De ce nu pot să fie acești oameni necontenit fericiți? Nici unul dintre cei de față n-a fost în stare să răspundă la întrebare. Eu am cugetat îndelung mai târziu și cred că am înțeles. În definitiv, o povestire fericită e o lectură destul de plicticoasă. Dacă în viața trăită aievea ți se întâmplă toate după pofta inimii — cu o fericire nedezmințită și un noroc permanent — e foarte bine, e perfect; dar în literatură nu merge! Dați-mi voie să ilustrez această idee. Să ticluim împreună o povestire în care să nu fie vorba, tot timpul, decât despre fericire și, pe măsură ce se desfășoară firul ei, să ne gândim, în contrast, la felul cum e înfățișată viața într-o nuvelă cu adevărat reușită. Aristotel Ganju, nu va uita niciodată luminoasa dimineață de octombrie, când i-a sosit scrisoarea care avea să-i schimbe dintr-o dată destinul. Tocmai sosise la biroul său din oraș, când a intrat stenografa și i-a pus scrisoarea pe masă. — E pentru dumneata, i-a spus. Apoi l-a sărutat și a ieșit din nou. Aristotel, a rămas câteva clipe în picioare, privind scrisoarea din fața lui. S-o deschidă? Să n-o deschidă? La urma urmelor, de ce n-ar deschide-o? A deschis plicul, apoi i-a venit o idee: să citească scrisoarea! De ce n-ar citi-o? gândi el. Iubite domnule Aristotel (spunea scrisoarea), dacă aţi avea amabilitatea să treceţi pe la biroul nostru, am fi fericiţi să vă facem o comunicare importantă, în propriul dumneavoastră interes. “ Scrisoarea era semnată: Vasile C. Tanoviceanu. Hârtia purta antetul: Tanoviceanu C. & comp., consilieri juridici, avocaţi etc., str. Lunii nr. 13. După câteva minute, Aristotel era în drum spre biroul avocaţilor de la Tanoviceanu C. & comp. Niciodată străzile nu i se păruseră mai curate şi mai vesele ca în acea minunată lumină a soarelui de toamnă. Şi poate nici nu fuseseră. Aristotel nu era stăpânit de nici o presimţire rea şi nici nu bănuia o ştire proastă, când domnul Tanoviceanu, primul asociat al firmei, s-a ridicat de pe scaun ca să-l salute. Dimpotrivă! Domnul Tanoviceanu, era un bărbat plăcut, între două vârste, a cărui privire, în dosul ochelarilor înrămaţi în aur, era plină de bunăvoinţă şi prietenie. — A, domnul Aristotel Ganju, spuse el; sau poate îmi vei îngădui să te numesc pur şi simplu Aristotel. N-am socotit cu cale să-ţi dau prea multe amănunte în scurta scrisoare pe care ţi-am adresat-o. Iată despre ce e vorba. Biroul nostru a primit însărcinarea de a-ţi înmâna o moştenire, sau mai bine zis o donaţie. Ai răbdare! îl opri avocatul, văzându-l pe Aristotel gata să-l întrerupă cu întrebări. Singura dorinţă a clientului nostru a fost ca numele lui să rămână necunoscut. A socotit că va fi mult mai plăcut pentru dumneata să primeşti banii fără să ştii cine ţi i-a dat. Aristotel, a murmurat că e de aceeaşi părere. Domnul Tanoviceanu a apăsat pe o sonerie. — Banii cuveniţi domnului Aristotel Ganju, te rog, a spus el. O nostimă stenografă, purtând la talie un trandafir „Frumuseţe moldovenească“, a intrat în birou cu un sac de mătase. — Aici e o jumătate de milion de dolari în bancnote de 100 de dolari, a spus avocatul. Noi nu i-am numărat, dar e cifra pe care ne-a comunicat-o clientul nostru. Aristotel, a luat sacul de mătase, a mulţumit şi a plecat. Pe drum, în tramvaiul care-l ducea spre casă, se gândea ce plăcut e să ai noroc. În buzunar avea douăzeci şi cinci de lei — era tot ce-i rămăsese — şi în poală, în tramvai, ţinea cu grijă sacul de mătase cu o jumătate de milion de dolari...."
mov_A43C2030A51E6D9230940A65C28DAC79,2025-07-08 15:40:00,en,WEB,"  From Waste to Worldwide Use: A Bold Commerce Initiative Powered by VTEX NEW YORK, July 08, 2025 BUSINESS WIRE From landfill to Lions: what began as a project in one of the world's most polluted landscapes earned VTEX (NYSE: VTEX), the backbone of connected commerce, two Bronze Lions Awards at the 2025 Cannes Lions International Festival. Awarded in the 'Media (Use of Digital Platforms)' and 'Direct (Corporate Purpose & Social Responsibility)' categories, the wins recognized the RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA initiative as a bold collaboration between VTEX, Artplan, Desierto Vestido and Fashion Revolution, becoming a blueprint in enterprise circular commerce. In addition to the two Bronze Lions recognitions, RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA was also shortlisted in four additional categories. The Atacama Desert has become a global symbol of excess production, receiving more than 40,000 tons of retail waste every year, mainly from North America and Europe. RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA wasn't just about spotlighting a crisis. It was about proving the versatile power of digital commerce. Each garment was hand-selected, sanitized, and restored. Many were unworn, still bearing original brand tags. The inventory was redistributed at no cost, with consumers only paying for shipping. Winning two Bronze Lions over hundreds of submissions comes off the heels of VTEX, being recognized as the only vendor named a Gartner® Customers' Choice in the 2025 Voice of the Customer for Digital Commerce report for the second year in a row. The Impact of RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA: Activated the first globally scalable circular commerce model from recovered desert fast fashion waste, and powered by a simplified and adaptable enterprise-grade digital commerce platform. Redistributed inventory to consumers in 10+ countries around the globe. Sold out inventory in just under five hours without paid media. Generated a whopping 200,000 signups for future waste drops. Delivered branded UX, storytelling, and packaging that sparked global connection and community towards a larger movement. Built in full collaboration: Desierto Vestido (recovery), Fashion Revolution Brazil (upcycle), Artplan (creative), VTEX (commerce engine). Mariano Gomide de Faria, Founder and Co-CEO of VTEX, said: ""RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA winning two Bronze Lions at Cannes 2025 sends a clear message: commerce can do more than scale global enterprise brands. With the remarkable partnership of Artplan, Desierto Vestido, and Fashion Revolution, we have proven how adaptable digital commerce platforms can correct, redistribute, and challenge the logic of excess. At VTEX, we're proud to have disrupted the model of linear consumption. This is one of the most urgent and transformative campaigns we've been part of this year, and it signals to other digital commerce platforms that neutrality In the conversation of retail waste is no longer an option. RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA has set the standard for global impact as value is defined by what is recovered, not just by what is sold."" Built for viability over virality, RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA is now evolving into a long-term solution. In partnership with the University of Chile, the next phase focuses on transforming volunteer roles into paid work, generating local income, and formalizing the recovery and redistribution of discarded garments. The goal is a sustainable environmental and economic model led by a strong community. As AI reshapes the future of commerce, RE-COMMERCE ATACAMA is a case study in purposeful design meeting adaptable digital infrastructure. When intention is rooted in impact, transformation scales. And what started in the desert is now a global benchmark for regenerative commerce powered by technology, community, and creativity.

mov_392E81CF3A85400B2690AB79FE03A3B0,2025-07-09 01:10:57,en,WEB,"  In this column, the usual roles are reversed, and I answer questions about my new book, “Franklin High School: Two Basketball Dynasties.” Question: What is your new book about? Answer: It is a book about the memoirs of Michael Ferrara. He was a legend in basketball in Sussex County during the 1970s. Q: What inspired the book? A: I caught up with Mike a year or so ago. He was keenly interested in recording his life in the sport of basketball and getting his experiences for others to have. As we are alumni of Franklin High School, we were aware that there were two times when basketball at our school was tremendously popular and successful. One era was in the 1950s or so with Coach Reginald Purdy. Another time was in the 1970s with the Stefkoviches and also Mike Ferrara. Q. Tell me about Ferrara. A. Mike grew up down near the city and his family moved to Pleasant Valley Lake in Vernon. He went to Franklin High School, which was still operating as such and had done so until the early 1980s. The kids now go to Wallkill Valley Regional High School. Mike became an outstanding player on the high school basketball team and went on to play at Colgate University and then was drafted into the NBA. Q: What are the highlights of his career? A. He started out in college at Niagara University and then moved to Colgate. While at Colgate, he scored 1,763 points, which was then a school record. He still holds the school record for points in a season, which is 772, and also the number of steals in a season of 94. He finished a very close second to the leading scorer in NCAA Division I during the 1980-81 season. During that time, Mike had a fantastic 28.6 points per game average. He was also named the Patriot Conference prestigious Player of the Year. Mike went on to be drafted by the Washington Bullets. He had a number of fascinating stories that he speaks about in the book. We also bring into play several of the important people in his life and athletic journey. Chiefly among them are the coaches he had. One was Coach Frank Virtue of his time at Franklin. Coach Virtue was beloved by many from the town. Through the book, Mike describes how influences by special people impacted his life, broadened his horizons and aided in the development as an exceptional player. Q. How is this book different from others you have written? A. This happens to be the seventh book that I have published. It is the first book where we were working on a memoir. The vigor that Mike had when we got together a year or so made me laugh. I had known him for some 40 years and he was always high-energy. But he still possessed the same level of enthusiasm and eagerness as way back when. He worked out daily near his home in Tampa, Fla., and had a strong regimen that he followed. Making the book was a fun time with him and interviewing our mutual old adviser, Coach Virtue. Q: Where can we get the book? A: “Franklin High School: Two Basketball Dynasties” is available at the Sparta Bookstore and Broad Street Books in Branchville. You also can get an e-version (Kindle) on Amazon along with a soft cover and a hard cover. Q: Any parting words? A: I certainly have mixed feelings on the book. You see, Mike, ole' #44 as he liked to be referred to (his retired number at Colgate), passed away on Sunday June 15. While he was full of his lifelong enthusiasm just a few months ago, he had been diagnosed with Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS), often called Lou Gehrig's disease. While we didn't know it at the beginning, we worked hard to get the book done as soon as we could. As it turned out, I was only awaiting his last “yes” of approval on the back cover layout when he took deathly ill and was unable to reply with that one word. So, while the book is fantastic, the culmination was disheartening...."

She tallied four assists and added one goal, finishing the year with five points which tied for fourth among rookie rearguards. “I'm thrilled to be re-signing with the Sirens as we continue to create something special with this organization,” said Simpson. “I'm excited to play a role in the league's continued growth while helping shape the Sirens into a championship team. I can't wait to get back on the ice with my teammates, old and new, and give everything I have for them and the fans who have supported us from day one.” Before turning pro, Simpson honed her skills under Head Coach Greg Fargo at Colgate University, where she played for five seasons. She appeared in 174 games and recorded 107 points, capped by a career-high 34 points (9G, 25A) in 40 games during the 2023-24 campaign. She led the Raiders to a Frozen Four berth after scoring the game-winning goal against Cornell. Internationally, Simpson won back-to-back gold medals with Team USA at the 2017 and 2018 IIHF U18 Women's World Championships. The 5'8” Simpson returns to a Sirens lineup that has five other defenders under contract for the 2025-26 season, including Lauren Bernard, Jaime Bourbonnais, Maja Nylén Persson, Jincy Roese and captain Micah Zandee-Hart.

Learn more Shoppers making the move from manual to electric toothbrushes might want to dive into Amazon Prime Day 2025's oral-care offers as there are some sparkling deals on top brands. The likes of Oral-B and Philips have slashed the prices on some of their gadgets, providing a great opportunity to upgrade a dental routine for less. With discounts of up to £310 off, there are some serious savings to be had and as a shopping writer who has tried and tested over five electric toothbrushes from Oral-B, SURI and more, my hand-picked deals make spotting the best ones a whole lot easier. While a manual brush can do the job, they have nothing on their tech counterparts in terms of ease, functionality and overall results. As the average person spends more than 80 days in their life cleaning their teeth, it's well worth investing in a high quality brush - and these deals mean you don't have to spend a fortune. READ MORE: 'I'm a beauty writer - the new ghd curling wand gave me perfect waves in 15 mins' READ MORE: The best electric toothbrush tested as Oral-B, Philips and Ordo compared To take advantage of the deals customers will need to be a member of Amazon Prime. Those that are not can sign up for a free 30 day trial and enjoy discounts during the duration of Amazon Prime Day. Elsewhere, Oral-B are also running a summer sale, with bundles including free toothbrush heads, toothpaste, mouthwash and more. It is also Boots 'super savings week' and shoppers can find discounts on electricals from brush-baby, Oral-B, Colgate and Philips. Free Amazon Prime membership £8.99 Free Amazon Get Prime here Amazon Prime membership, including exclusive Prime Day discounts and perks on Hello Fresh, music, books and Prime Video. Usually £8.99 a month, you can now get a 30-day free trial to get access to the latest deals. Oral-B iO2 Electric Toothbrush, now £40, was £100 With a 60% off discount, the Oral-B iO2 model is now £39.99 reduced from £100. This beats the price of Boots and the Oral-B website, where it is on sale for £45. It's a top of the range toothbrush as it boasts three brushing modes (daily clean, sensitive and super sensitive), a gum pressure sensor and a 30 second timer letting the user know when to clean a different part of the mouth. It also comes with a travel case, for less than £40 all in. There are various different colours in stock, from black to white, plus spending £3 extra means customers can get a sturdier case with a special design. One shopper was left very impressed with the 'long lasting battery' and another said its 'smooth and quiet clean' has 'exceeded expectations'. Someone else said the 'vibration feels a little rough', but they got used to the sensation 'pretty quickly'. Oral-B iO8 Electric Toothbrush, now £139, was £450 Saving shoppers more than £300, the Oral-B iO8 can be snapped up for £139.99, down from £450. Nearly 70% off, this mega deal has been hailed 'good value for money' as it is a 'five star toothbrush'. Features include six cleaning modes (daily clean, sensitive, whiten, gum care, intense and super sensitive) and sensor alerts. Oral-B's iO8 model takes things up a notch in terms of dentalcare as it boasts AI intelligence, recognising your brushing style and guiding you via an app. The real-time feedback is 'impressive' and 'by far the best' for some, while others found it 'not necessary'. SURI Electric Toothbrush, now £56, was £75 The SURI Sustainable Electric Toothbrush is the device I have been using for the last two years - and it's still serving me well. I find it is reducing my cost of hygienist visits and I've even has friends ask me where I got the toothbrush from when away on trips. On sale at Amazon for £56.25, it is incredibly lightweight, making it perfect for travel, and it comes in four stylish colours. The eco-friendly gadget has been designed to clean teeth with a minimal impact on the environment, using brush heads made from plant-based materials. It is important to note that users will have to stick to the SURI brush heads and you can pick up a pack of three for £14.99. The brand also offers a brush head subscription service. SURI toothbrushes are also 25% off on their website as part of the summer sale. Shoppers can read my full review here. Philips Sonicare 6100 Electric Toothbrush, now £99, was £290 Having tried the Philips Sonicare DiamondClean Prestige 9900, I can vouch that the brand make an exceptional toothbrush. This model in particular is on sale for Prime, but is still at the pricier end of the scale at £199.99, down from £267. Those looking to spend under £100 can nab the Philips Sonicare 6100 model for £99.99, reduced from £290. A saving of £200, the toothbrush comes with two spare brush heads and a nifty travel case. Shoppers can get it in black, white or blue, and enjoy perks such as two brushing modes and three intensity levels...."

mov_ABD586C06AF3EAA7CABD6593FCAA7F4A,2025-07-10 20:44:30,en,WEB,"  CBA forward Jack Donohue could be the latest in a line of former Siena ball boys to make their names as Division I basketball players. Donohue worked as a Saints ball boy for four seasons. He began under former coach Mitch Buonaguro and continued for Jimmy Patsos, a friend of Donohue's father, Darren. ""It was great,"" Jack Donohue said. ""I loved it. At halftime, you're able to play. When you roll out the balls, you're able to shoot a little bit before you get in trouble. It was fun to be out on the court, like you were a Division I athlete at the age of 10."" It's possible Donohue, entering his junior year of high school, could make MVP Arena his home in college. Siena coach Gerry McNamara has offered him a scholarship. But the Saints have growing competition for Donohue, who is 6-foot-7 and 215 pounds. He has been offered by several other schools, including the University at Albany, Bryant and Pennsylvania. Bryant coach Jamion Christian and Penn coach Fran McCaffery are former Siena coaches. ""He's a very good shooter,"" said dad Darren, a Shaker graduate. ""He's very tangible, is what all the coaches say. He can rebound, he can run, he's strong and he can really shoot the ball well."" Jack Donohue said he's talking to Siena, UAlbany, Penn, Bryant and La Salle about setting up official visits in August and September. He's also speaking with Colgate and Harvard. Assuming he gets to Division I, Donohue will continue a Siena ball boy tradition. McCaffery's sons Connor and Patrick served that role for the Saints before following their father to his next job at Iowa. They played for him with the Hawkeyes. Brothers Kevin and Thomas Huerter were also Siena ball boys. Kevin spent two seasons at Maryland, became a NBA first-round draft pick and now plays for the Chicago Bulls. Thomas played for Siena, his father Tom's alma mater. Siena offered Donohue last month. ""To be local and have such a great program, and the history of the program be held on a pedestal, it's great to be having them reach out to me,"" he said. ""The relationship's grown since then. They're always reaching out to me, which is nice."" The Donohues credit much of Jack's development to his play with the New Jersey Shoreshots, an AAU program directed by former Rutgers and Robert Morris coach Mike Rice. Donahue played this spring for the 16-and-under team. Quinton Redding, his 16U coach, said he watched Donohue develop from a catch-and-shoot player into someone who has the confidence to put the ball on the floor and become a stronger rebounder. ""I feel like he was maybe just trying to fit in, and told him just to be himself,"" Redding said. ""He's here for a reason. Once he heard that advice, he did his thing and took off."" Redding said Donohue had his breakout performance at an Under Armour tournament in Hamilton, Ohio in May. He shot better than 40% from 3-point range and rebounded well. ""I think he's a mid-major (college prospect) right now and, by the time he gets to his senior year, he has the potential to be a Power Five player,"" Redding said. Darren, his father, said Stanford and Notre Dame have reached out, but without offers, so far. Jack Donohue gets at least some of his height and talent from his mother, Danielle (Galarneau) Donohue, a 6-foot-1 Troy native. She's in the Marist Hall of Fame after scoring 1,141 points and grabbing 833 rebounds for the Red Foxes. ""She played down in the post, so anytime I have any questions about being a post player, or just footwork-wise down low, I always go to her because I know how successful she was on the court,"" Jack said. He returns next season to a talented CBA team that includes star teammate JJ Osinski, son of former Siena star Corey Osinski. When was a ball boy, Jack Donohue envisioned playing for Siena. He's getting closer to reaching Division I, whether for the Saints or somewhere else. ""Just playing at that level alone was a dream of mine,"" he said. ""To now be living it, it's pretty cool.""

This is first time a woman will lead the FMCG giant in its 92-year history. Investors and brokerages are cheering India's largest fast moving consumer goods player Hindustan Unilever Ltd's (HUL) latest CEO and MD Priya Nair, who will replace the current chief Rohit Jawa, starting August 1, 2025. HUL announced the appointment of Priya Nair as its new Chief Executive Officer and Managing Director, making her the first woman to lead the FMCG giant in its 92-year history. She is currently President, Beauty & Wellbeing, Unilever. Story continues below In an exchange filing, the FMCG major said that she replaces Rohit Jawa, who will step down as CEO and MD on July 31, 2025 to pursue the next chapter in his personal and professional journey. According to analysts, Priya Nair will provide the FMCG player with the required boost to navigate the rising competitive challenges, while accelerating HUL's digital transformation efforts. Further, with her long-standing experience at HUL, she is well-positioned to help the firm capitalize on the evolving and long-term prospects of the Indian consumption market, stated Japan-based Nomura. The brokerage offered an example from Priya Nair's stint in the Home Care segment from 2014 to 2020. During this time, the segment's EBIT margin soared 570 basis points from 13.1 percent in FY14, to 18.8 percent in FY20. As a result, HUL's overall EBIR margin rose from 15 percent to 22.3 percent over the years. From 2020 to 2022, Priya Nair was instrumental in HUL's premiumization thrust. She drove the shift from from value offerings to the premium segment by driving 26 percent of HUL's portfolio focus towards premium demand spaces compared to 20 percent in 2020. With Nair stepping to the helm, HUL is likely to enter a new phase of growth and innovation, noted Nitin Paranjpe, Chairman, HUL. This will be very closely watched by experts, who have often voiced concerns around the FMCG player's underperformance compared to peers. Thanking Jawa for his contributions, Nitin Paranjpe, Chairman, HUL, said, “On behalf of the Board, I thank Rohit for steering the company through a challenging market and laying the foundations for future success. His strategic clarity and decisive actions further strengthened HUL's leadership.” Story continues below He added, “Priya has had an exemplary career across HUL and Unilever. With her deep knowledge of the Indian consumer and a global perspective, I am confident she will lead HUL into a new phase of growth and innovation.” Over the past five years, shares of HUL have recorded a mere eight percent uptick. However, the change should bring some comfort to the firm's stock price. Citi Research noted that management changes in the Indian consumer space have been a much talked about factor on Street. Further, in recent memory, the markets saw big rallies and eventual business performance improvements at Godrej Consumer and Colgate India, following a change in management. According to Goldman Sachs, HUL's volume growth will gradually improve over FY26. Morgan Stanley and Investec, both, noted that the departure of Rohit Jawa came as a surprise, given his shorter-than-expected stint. The brokerages also pointed to a recent reshuffle in HUL parent Unilever's CEO, with the former CEO stepping down in February. Macquarie, however, allayed concerns, noting that while the sudden departure of Rohit Jawa and the relatively short period of transition remain concerning, the brokerage gains comfort from Priya's long period of experience in India. Further, the change of guard will drive a stronger focus on growth, especially in the Beauty segment.

During this time, I neglected my oral hygiene and that led me to develop many cavities. Maybe around 20, I know, a lot. I ended up getting them filled not too long after. I was still left with weak enamel. Fast forward a few years later, I ended up having to get a gum graft. WORST experience ever. It was awful and I don't want to go through it again. I have tried to do everything. I try to floss daily. Brush 1 - 2 times a day. Enamel toothpaste burns so I just don't use it, I just stick to Colgate because it doesn't burn and seems to help a little bit. I do a water + salt rinse. Once a week I do a water + hydrogen peroxide mix. And on top of that I do oil pulling before I brush every night. I'm about to go to the dentist this week but I wanted opinions and suggestions before hand. I have had multiple dentists and they all said many different things. Some say you can reverse recession, others said I can't. Currently 18, and I'm scared that all of these cavities and neglect from when I was younger are going to lead to root canal's, crowns, more gum grafts, or extraction of the tooth in general. Is there any way I can keep my real teeth throughout the majority of my lifetime even with the current damage at a young age."

Encore faudrait-il ne pas passer l'aspirateur en mode silencieux, avec le sac percé. Marine Le Pen et Jordan Bardella n'ont pas arrêté de claironner leur volonté de faire “la chasse aux brebis galeuses” au sein du RN. Propre sur lui, sourire Colgate, Bardella se présente en gendre idéal de la Ve République. Et Marine, elle, joue à la candidate républicaine, “dédiabolisée”, presque fréquentable. Mais la réalité ? Elle est beaucoup moins présentable. Et carrément encombrante. 👉 Dernière en date : Caroline Parmentier, très proche de Marine, ex-journaliste au journal ultra-catho Présent, qui qualifiait l'avortement de “génocide moral”, regrettait que le Maréchal Pétain soit “sali” par les historiens, évoquait les “supporters babouins”, le “lobby juif”, et assimilait le préservatif à une “tromperie criminelle”. Et la réaction de Marine ? Une pirouette rhétorique : “C'est une fierté d'avoir arraché certaines personnes à ces pensées-là”. Donc, tout va bien, tant qu'on n'utilise pas trop de majuscules sur Facebook. 🚨 Sauf que ce n'est pas un cas isolé. Une dizaine de députés RN ont récemment tenu des propos racistes ou antisémites. Aucune exclusion. Aucune mise à l'écart. Silence radio. Parce qu'au RN, on ne renie pas ses racines : on les planque sous le tapis du salon. Et pendant ce temps-là, Roger Chudeau, député du Loir-et-Cher, peut attaquer tranquillement les binationaux et Najat Vallaud-Belkacem sans que ça déclenche autre chose qu'un haussement d'épaules. Les “brebis galeuses”, en fait, on les garde… tant qu'elles rapportent des voix. Mais ce n'est pas tout. Parlons un peu des affaires judiciaires : • L'affaire des emplois fictifs au Parlement européen (le RN a été condamné à rembourser plus de 300 000 euros) • Les détournements de fonds publics liés à leurs assistants parlementaires • Les financements obscurs des campagnes (prêts russes, montages bancaires douteux…) • Les procès à répétition pour provocation à la haine raciale, injures publiques ou homophobie • Et plus récemment, les propos d'élus RN qui multiplient les dérapages sans conséquences internes : du racisme soft à la nostalgie pétainiste en passant par le sexisme crasse. 🎭 Le RN “nouveau”, c'est une opération marketing : Bardella fait des selfies à l'Assemblée, serre la main de Sarkozy, et sourit sur CNews comme s'il allait vendre des brosses à dents. Mais grattes un peu sous le vernis, et tu retrouves toujours la même base : une idéologie d'extrême droite, servie par les mêmes réflexes autoritaires, les mêmes ambiguïtés sur les droits humains, et la même indulgence pour les discours nauséabonds. Et à ce rythme-là, ce sont les travailleurs, les retraités, les femmes, les minorités, et tous ceux qui croient à une République sociale, solidaire et laïque qui risquent de payer l'addition. ⸻ 🧨 Conclusion ? Le RN ne chasse pas les brebis galeuses. Il les tond, les maquille, et les met sur les affiches. Et certains continuent de bêler en cadence."

Una mossa unilaterale, punitiva, che rafforza l'idea di un mondo diviso in blocchi dominati da interessi privati. Ma noi, persone normali, abbiamo un potere che sottovalutiamo: il potere del consumo consapevole. Basta con l'America nel carrello Non stiamo parlando di odio, ma di coerenza. Se veniamo attaccati economicamente, se l'Europa è trattata come colonia commerciale, perché dovremmo continuare ad arricchire le multinazionali americane con i nostri acquisti quotidiani? La lista dei marchi americani in Italia è lunga, e li troviamo in ogni supermercato: Coca‑Cola, Kellogg's, Oreo, Pringles Dash, Gillette, Oral‑B, Pampers Colgate, Palmolive, Ajax Swiffer, Mr. Muscle, Glade, Duracell Sono marchi radicati nelle nostre abitudini. Ma non sono insostituibili. E non finisce al supermercato Anche auto, telefoni, lavatrici, computer, TV sono spesso americani: Auto: Ford, Jeep, Tesla Elettrodomestici: Whirlpool, GE, KitchenAid Tecnologie: Apple, Microsoft, HP, Google Smartphone: iPhone, Pixel Servizi digitali: Amazon, Netflix, Meta Ognuno di questi acquisti sostiene un'economia che non ci rispetta. E non ci protegge. Esistono alternative Vuoi una bibita? Scegli un prodotto italiano. Vuoi un'auto? Preferisci europeo, giapponese o coreano. Hai bisogno di tecnologia? Asus, Samsung, Bosch sono opzioni solide e fuori dal circuito USA. Smetti di pensare che non serva a niente. Serve eccome. Se milioni di europei smettono di comprare americano, il messaggio arriva forte. Colpisce dove fa più male: nei profitti. Attivismo è anche questo Non servono bandiere né cortei. Serve coscienza. La prossima volta che prendi in mano una bottiglia, un dentifricio, un detersivo, un telefono, chiediti: sto nutrendo chi mi sta affamando? Boicottare non è odio. È autodifesa. È una forma di solidarietà silenziosa, potente, concreta. Ora tocca a te. Non subire. Reagisci. Comincia dal tuo carrello. Comincia da oggi. ADDENDUM – ELENCO RAGIONATO PER SETTORI DEI PRODOTTI E MARCHI AMERICANI DA BOICOTTARE IN ITALIA Boicottare significa scegliere. Significa usare la propria volontà come leva.

Gestiscono i tuoi dati come merce: ogni click, messaggio e amicizia viene profilata e venduta a inserzionisti. 2. Sono strumenti di condizionamento politico e culturale, veicolano valori funzionali al potere dominante americano. 3. Oscurano contenuti non allineati, pur mantenendo finta neutralità. 4.

Encore faudrait-il ne pas passer l'aspirateur en mode silencieux, avec le sac percé. Marine Le Pen et Jordan Bardella n'ont pas arrêté de claironner leur volonté de faire “la chasse aux brebis galeuses” au sein du RN. Propre sur lui, sourire Colgate, Bardella se présente en gendre idéal de la Ve République. Et Marine, elle, joue à la candidate républicaine, “dédiabolisée”, presque fréquentable. Mais la réalité ? Elle est beaucoup moins présentable. Et carrément encombrante. 👉 Dernière en date : Caroline Parmentier, très proche de Marine, ex-journaliste au journal ultra-catho Présent, qui qualifiait l'avortement de “génocide moral”, regrettait que le Maréchal Pétain soit “sali” par les historiens, évoquait les “supporters babouins”, le “lobby juif”, et assimilait le préservatif à une “tromperie criminelle”. Et la réaction de Marine ? Une pirouette rhétorique : “C'est une fierté d'avoir arraché certaines personnes à ces pensées-là”. Donc, tout va bien, tant qu'on n'utilise pas trop de majuscules sur Facebook. 🚨 Sauf que ce n'est pas un cas isolé. Une dizaine de députés RN ont récemment tenu des propos racistes ou antisémites. Aucune exclusion. Aucune mise à l'écart. Silence radio. Parce qu'au RN, on ne renie pas ses racines : on les planque sous le tapis du salon. Et pendant ce temps-là, Roger Chudeau, député du Loir-et-Cher, peut attaquer tranquillement les binationaux et Najat Vallaud-Belkacem sans que ça déclenche autre chose qu'un haussement d'épaules. Les “brebis galeuses”, en fait, on les garde… tant qu'elles rapportent des voix. Mais ce n'est pas tout. Parlons un peu des affaires judiciaires : • L'affaire des emplois fictifs au Parlement européen (le RN a été condamné à rembourser plus de 300 000 euros) • Les détournements de fonds publics liés à leurs assistants parlementaires • Les financements obscurs des campagnes (prêts russes, montages bancaires douteux…) • Les procès à répétition pour provocation à la haine raciale, injures publiques ou homophobie • Et plus récemment, les propos d'élus RN qui multiplient les dérapages sans conséquences internes : du racisme soft à la nostalgie pétainiste en passant par le sexisme crasse. 🎭 Le RN “nouveau”, c'est une opération marketing : Bardella fait des selfies à l'Assemblée, serre la main de Sarkozy, et sourit sur CNews comme s'il allait vendre des brosses à dents. Mais grattes un peu sous le vernis, et tu retrouves toujours la même base : une idéologie d'extrême droite, servie par les mêmes réflexes autoritaires, les mêmes ambiguïtés sur les droits humains, et la même indulgence pour les discours nauséabonds. Et à ce rythme-là, ce sont les travailleurs, les retraités, les femmes, les minorités, et tous ceux qui croient à une République sociale, solidaire et laïque qui risquent de payer l'addition. Conclusion ? Le RN ne chasse pas les brebis galeuses. Il les tond, les maquille, et les met sur les affiches. Et certains continuent de bêler en cadence"

Gonzalez starred overseas for Real Madrid, and was briefly teammates with incoming Gonzaga freshman guard Mario Saint-Supery, who committed to Mark Few's club in early July. Gonzalez spoke highly of the 19-year-old guard in a conversation with Theo Lawson of the Spokesman-Review at NBA Summer League on Friday, saying Gonzaga is ""going to get a slasher that's really, really aggressive."" ""Really good defender on ball,"" Gonzalez continued. ""He's also a big competitor. We're both really, really competitive.""

Really good defender on ball. He's also a big competitor. We're both really, really competitive."" Saint-Supery has long been connected to Mark Few and the Zags, with rumors swirling about the 6'4 guard coming to Spokane way back in April. Saint-Supery is the latest international find for Gonzaga's coaching staff, who have an incredibly rich history of bringing in talent from overseas - including Rui Hachimura, Filip Petrusev, Killian Tillie, Pryzemek Karnowski, Ronny Turiaf, Joel Ayayi, and Elias Harris among many others. Saint-Supery starred for Spain in the 2024 FIBA U18 EuroBasket event, averaging over 21 points per game along with six assists and five rebounds. Compared to Ricky Rubio due to his elite passing skills, Saint-Supery is an excellent fit in Few's high-octane, heavy ball movement offensive sets. While Colgate transfer Braeden Smith, who redshirted last year behind Ryan Nembhard, is projected to be Gonzaga's starter at point guard this year, Saint-Supery should get plenty of run right away for the Zags and could play his way into a bigger role as the season goes on, particularly as he gets comfortable in the new system, and new country.

Allergies could indicate MCAS which is generally helped by type 1 and 2 antihistamines alongside mast cell stabilisers such as ketotifen and cromolyn sodium."
