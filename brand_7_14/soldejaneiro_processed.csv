A paraben-free self-tanner perfect for summoning a sun-kissed glow without ever needing to step outside. This dreamy mousse glides over your skin smoothly, ensuring an even application without those pesky streaks *and* you don't have to wait ages to see the magic happen — just one hour, and you'll be glowing like you've spent a day basking in the sun. It's also vegan, cruelty free, made from recycled materials, and *doesn't* leave any gross fake tan smells! Promising review: “If you use St. Tropez tan products or any fake tanner, do yourself a favor and try this. This stuff is AWESOME. Dries quickly, lasts longer, does NOT make your skin stinky, applies evenly, and you get a fair amount of product!! Other tanners I've used become VERY noticeable when they start fading. Gross hand lines, patchy white spots, etc., but not this stuff. The best one-hour tan I have ever used!” —Review Writer Get it from Amazon for $9.09+ (available in five tanning levels and 12 styles). 2. A bestselling Sol De Janeiro body cream that can help tighten and smooth your skin with the help of caffeine-rich guarana, hydrating cupuacu butter, açaí oil, and coconut oil. This fast-absorbing formula allows your skin to indulge in a little pampering, leaving your skin soft and supple and smelling like a tropical paradise. Seriously, people are *obsessed* with how this stuff smells. Its warm gourmand fragrance has notes of salted caramel, pistachio, and vanilla — yum! Caffeine can brighten skin and temporarily minimize the appearance of stretch marks and cellulite, if that's something you're looking for in a product. Read more about the skincare benefits of caffeine at the Cleveland Clinic. Promising review: ""I am 60 and I could not get rid of the cellulite on my legs. I started using this product six weeks ago and can noticeably see a difference. I apply morning and evening, before bed for optimal results. It goes on smooth and has a creamy, nonsticky feel. The smell is dreamy, and even my husband has commented on the improvement. Make sure you apply in a circular motion for optimal coverage, absorption and circulation."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24+ (available in three sizes). 3. A hydrating lip-plumping gloss here to make you wonder if you've mysteriously swapped smiles with Angelina Jolie herself. This set comes with a daytime formula featuring ginger essence to give you that extra ✨ plumpness ✨ and a nighttime formula with mint to repair and moisturize. You'll get one lip plumper and one minty sleeping mask for your lips. Promising review: ""I loved this stuff, it was magic. The evening moisturizer was fabulous. It is the first plumper that actually works for me. Will be buying more for gifts!!!!!"" —Alexandra Get it from Amazon for $9.98. 4. An adorable hydrating eye stick, aka the perfect remedy for dehydrated skin. This treatment is made with Icelandic glacier water, giving your delicate under-eye skin the fresh hydration boost it needs on days when you've hit the snooze button one too many times. It also helps tighten eye wrinkles if you'd prefer for them not to be as noticeable. And here's a tip! It reduces puffiness faster if used after refrigeration. Promising review: ""This stuff is magic! I purchased this product on a recommendation from a BuzzFeed list, and was not disappointed! I have not been sleeping well due to stress, and the first day I used it, my coworkers commented how well rested I looked! I told them about it and all of them ordered one for themselves. Very impressed!"" —Saminyah Marcelin..."

OK, I need 30 bottles of Mike's Hot Honey *right now*. 1. An O'Keeffe's Lip Repair sleeping mask so you can wake up with soft, hydrated lippies. No one loves a chapped pout, so let this balm heal and repair your dry, cracked lips. Reviewers love love love this brand's Working Hands and Healthy Feet creams, and they're obsessing over this sleep mask just as much. Promising review: ""When I travel, my lips get so chapped! It's painful. I discovered this product while searching for something to treat extremely chapped lips. I've used other O'Keeffe's products, so I trusted the brand. I used this as directed in the morning and before bed, and my lips healed faster than ever. Also, on the next trip I went on, I took it with me and used it daily. My lips stayed healthy and didn't get chapped at all. This stuff is magic and I won't go anywhere without it now."" —Anna C. Adams Get it from Amazon for $8.86 (also available in a two-pack). 2. A good ol' roll of boob tape that'll do all the bra lifting without needing to *actually* wear one. It's breathable, sweat-proof, and the perfect option to wear under any shirt or dress. Tape 'em up however you need for whatever you wear! I have this, and it works great for my C-cup boobs. Although I personally have never had an issue with it ripping my skin, here's some adhesive remover just in case. Promising review: ""As someone with large boobs, I've always struggled with strapless bras and basically accepted that I'd never be able to wear backless clothing. Growing up, I used those little sticky bras (the ones that look like chicken cutlets, you know the ones) but now, they just don't provide enough coverage or support for 36G boobs. For an upcoming wedding, I got a beautiful jumpsuit with an open-ish back and was determined to find something to hold my boobs up/in. Tried this boob tape and watched a couple of YouTube how-to videos and my life has been changed!!! Worked super well and held up perfectly for 8–9 hours in the LA summer heat (+ after party sweat). It was also not painful at all to remove at the end of the night. Highly recommend this boob tape for your backless top needs!!!"" —k Get it from Amazon for $14.95+ (available in 10 styles/colors). 3. A jar of Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum body cream made with a caffeine-rich guarana extract formula to help smooth and tighten skin. People are in loooove with this stuff, and some reviewers even just use it as, like, a perfume. Yeah, it smells that good. Read more about the skincare benefits of caffeine at the Cleveland Clinic. Promising reviews: ""I bought this for the first time a few years ago to replace the body lotion I had previously used for years and years. While more expensive, I was willing to try Bum Bum cream based on the previous reviews. And it has not disappointed! Not too thick. Not sticky. And the smell is amazing. I get told many times a week how good I smell."" —Libby Solomon Get it from Amazon for $24+ (available in three sizes and a two-pack). 4. An under-eye brightener because you aren't sure if you'll ever actually not be exhausted, but you can def stop looking like it. It's ~enriched~ with shea butter and hyaluronic acid to give your dark circles a more ✨radiant✨ look. The pinkish tint helps balance out the blueish tint under your eyes as if you said a spell to make your dark circles *poof* away. Promising review: ""Took years off my eyes!..."

I was unfamiliar with your game."" —Me seeing the before and after photos for their shimmering body oil. 1. A useful waterproof baby carrier if you'd appreciate having your hands free when you take your little one in the pool. It's made of a fast-drying neoprene material (think surf suits) and has soft, padded straps. Promising review: ""Absolutely love this product. I used it when my son was only about 6–9-months-old, and I still use it now as he is 15-months-old. I just love this product. It is so easy to use the babies. Love it as they get to be in the water as well; this product also dries very quickly. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be in the water with their children. An added benefit is that you are hands free!"" —Hannabelle Price: $89.99 (available in six colors) 2. A pair of sockless shoe liners because the return of the sun also means the return of stinky, sweaty feet. Bleh! Sometimes, you don't want or need a layer of socks, and that's where these washable and absorbent shoe liners come in handy! The liners come with trimming guidelines so that you can cut the insert to your desired size. Promising review: ""I can't recommend these inserts enough! After a week of heavy use, they hardly smell. Pop them in the wash, and they are ready to go again! Super comfy and doesn't move around. So nice to have in shoes you don't feel like wearing socks with! Plus, so many fun patterns!"" —Vicky L. Parr Price: $9.99+ (available in two sizes [fits women's sizes 6–13] and four colors) 3. A Sol de Janeiro shimmering body oil with SPF 50 for a dazzling glow without the white cast or the greasy feel — because my sweat glands are already in overdrive the minute temps rise above 80 degrees. And it's Sol de Janeiro, so you know it smells amazing. Duh! Promising review: ""I use this on vacation every time. As a Black girl, it makes my skin GLOWWWW! and the SPF is great, and I feel protected always."" —Jilly Price: $30 4. A lavender-scented Downy laundry odor remover to really get into the fibers of your clothing and linens to remove odor-causing residue. If you're sweating up a storm in the warmer months or stinking up your clothes in front of a campfire (worth it for the s'mores, tho!) , you'll wanna keep this on hand. Promising review: ""My husband is a Master Mechanic and obviously works with different oils, greases, and fluids. Even though I use really good detergent, stain booster, and good liquid softener along with a pre-wash, it never seemed like I could get all of the smells out. Not now, this product is amazing!!! My husband's work clothes come out smelling so fresh! I was actually supposed to, but it really does a great job. Now I use it with all my laundry and it's never smelled so good."" —Joann Baker Price: $12.97 5...."

Fruchtig und leicht durch den wunderschönen Feigenakkord, ein wenig frisch durch die Mandarine, abgerundet durch eine herbe Galbanharz-Note, sodass der Duft einen - gerade an wärmeren Tagen - nicht erdrückt. Falls es doch mal etwas süßer sein darf, ist das Sol de Janeiro Água Mística Hair and Body Fragrance Mist aktuell mein Favorit.

Abgerundet wird der Duft von einer salzigen Meeresbrise. Ebenfalls aus dem Hause Sol de Janeiro: das Rio Deo! Hier habe ich mich für die 59 entschieden, meinen persönlichen all time favourite.

Did you know that Amazon has a fun little section called ""Most Wished For,"" where you can see which products your fellow Amazon shoppers are currently adding to their wishlists? From TikTok-viral beauty finds to reviewer-beloved products, here are some items you'll want to add to your cart (or wish list) ASAP! 1. Some solar-powered lights to illuminate your summer garden with bursts of light that make it seem like Tinkerbell and crew are celebrating from dusk to dawn. These lights sway with the tiniest of breezes to mimic the appearance of fireflies, and their waterproof design means they'll weather almost any summer storm that blows through. Promising review: ""I am totally obsessed with these lights. I bought my first set and had them for about a week and couldn't get over how lovely they were. So, I have now purchased two more sets. They light up my flowers and azalea bushes beautifully. They have a lovely orange glow like little fireflies."" —A Lombardo Price: $14.98 (available as a four-, six-, or 10-pack) 2. A very chic crisscross swimsuit featuring a flirty cutout on the midriff that's going to turn heads like a scene out of Baywatch when you finally wade out into the water. And since swimsuits can be pretty pricey, no one will judge you for nabbing more than one of the bright color options! Promising review: ""Very glam in a '50s starlet way, a real bikini feel without being super exposed. I hate swimsuits, and this is the first one I've worn in about 10 years. I felt confident in it and really enjoyed myself at the weekend getaway. The little cutout makes it sexy to wear with a sarong or wrap for when you need to take a break from the poolside."" —Ms. Willows Price: $36.99+ (available in women's sizes XS–22 Plus and 20 colors) 3. A portable camping chair designed with patented rocking technology, so you can kick back and rock away next to the campfire while listening to scary stories. Elevate your comfort VIP seats (aka bring your own) at your pre-teen's little league games this summer with soft armrests, a phone pocket, and a beverage holder. FYI, the spring-action technology for the rocking works best on flat surfaces! Promising review: ""This chair was just what I was looking for! I am a mom of three, and this chair is my comfort zone when it comes to late-night sports and activities. I love that I can rock my one-year-old while my older kids do what they love. The chair is durable, easy to carry, and cute! I found that the product is well worth the money spent."" —Amazon Customer Price: $82.58 (available in five colors and five other styles) 4. A deet-free and spray-less mosquito repellent device — it creates a 15-foot shield around your yard or patio to repel those pesky bloodsuckers from party crashing. And the best part? No citronella smell! Promising review: ""We have used Thermacell for about 2 years, and it is a great product. My skin doesn't do well with applied repellant, so I was motivated to try a different strategy. I am astounded at how completely Thermacell repels mosquitoes and other flying insects — like black flies, deer flies, etc. We were in very thick mosquitoes last summer in MI, and could sit/eat/work outside the camper or at the beach without being bothered. ...The only time it doesn't work well is when it is windy (but the bugs don't bother so much when it is windy), so we position ourselves with a wind break. Have to watch the fuel level so we don't run out — which we have a few times, and immediately notice it because the bugs are back! Thermacell is DEFINITELY worth the money."" —A. Nichols Price: $15.41+ (available in eight colors) 5. A genius veggie chopper that can chop and dice pretty much anything in literal seconds. It comes with four interchangeable dice blades and a built-in storage container that you can use to prep and store food! You're going to be whipping up a lot of pico de gallo, salads, dips, and more this summer, so why not get some dependable help?..."

It looked phenomenal. So I purchased some. I haven't used it yet. My big thing is, I'm more fair skinned than her, but how does this not get all over clothes?

A tub of brightening, firming, and rejuvenating eye cream that'll halt all annoying comments about how tired you look. The rose hip and hibiscus-infused eye cream helps reduce dark circles and puffiness, leaving your eyes to look bright and wide (or alert and awake). Promising review: ""I have been using this daily for about eight months now. I am 60 years old. It reduced the puffiness and bags under my eyes. I am Sicilian and had dark circles. It has brightened up my eye area. I am very surprised as I have paid much more for eye creams that have done so much less. I recently had pre-cancerous cells removed at the bridge of my nose. After healing, I was left with a dark scar. The dermatologist told me that it would heal over time. Since I began to apply this eye cream, the mark has almost disappeared entirely. I shop constantly from Amazon. This is the first time that I have taken the time to write a review. That's how impressed I am with this product. If you decide to purchase this, you won't be sorry."" —Lynda M. Get it from Amazon for $12.74+ (available in three sizes). 2. Cosrx Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence, a gentle, lightweight, hydrating face serum designed for *all* skin types — even those with sensitive skin! It's used to protect your skin's moisture barrier, but reviewers swear by it for healing acne scars, fading dark spots, and smoothing fine lines, too. Reviewers say it's the most magical beauty product around! Promising review: ""I've been using this for only a few days now and I can already tell a difference in my skin. I wash my face and apply snail mucin to my damp face by patting it on and not rubbing it in. Just one pump is enough, so this bottle should last me a while with morning and night use. It's completely odorless and not sticky once it dries. It hasn't bothered my skin at all, which is wonderful because I can be a bit sensitive. I don't wear makeup and only moisturize with coconut oil. I'm 50 years old now and feel like I could use a little help with my facial skincare. My skin looks so much younger, smoother, and hydrated in such a short time. I'm happy to have found this!"" —Renee Get it from Amazon for $16.98. 3. K-Beauty's SeoulCeuticals Snail Repair Cream if you already have a serum in your routine that you love, but still want to reap the benefits of snail mucin. This non-comedogenic moisturizer contains 97.5% snail mucin filtrate as well as vitamin E, organic aloe, AND shea butter. It's practically a recipe for better skin. SeoulCeuticals is a small business! Promising review: ""I'm 55 years old, and my skin is a bit sensitive. I don't have a lot of wrinkles, but I'm definitely noticing a few more laugh lines and forehead crinkles than I had a few years ago! I've tried several moisturizers and have not been terribly impressed with any of them until now. This stuff really is great — incredibly hydrating without feeling greasy, and it absorbs quickly. It feels great on my skin. In just a few short weeks, I definitely noticed an improvement in my skin tone and fewer lines and wrinkles! Plus, the customer service is great. I had questions when I first received the product and got a follow-up response immediately. I will definitely be ordering this product again...."
my7h326,2025-06-17 04:05:48,en,REDDIT,"  Top tier: L'OCCITANE Instant Golden Glow with Almond Shimmering Body Oil $75 Your skin will look and smell amazing, not a sparkle definitely a beautiful shimmer. Don't let the almond fool you, the fragrance is also very appealing. My favourite, but less so now that I can only find it on Amazon and that kind of gives me the ick, however: SOL DE JANEIRO Glowmotions Rio Sunset Glow Oil by Sol de Janeiro $50-100 I mix this in with whatever lotion I'm using for my day to day. When I want my skin to look extra I'll use it on its own or closer to a one to one ratio with lotion. I love the smell as well. Layers well with other products. Accessible, drug store option: St. Moriz Glow Oil Body Illuminator $25 Mix with lotion or use it straight, not much of a smell. Not a glitter but not a super fine milled shimmer either but I go through the entire bottle when I end up picking it up in about a month sooo I am a fan(: When I use any of the products on their own I'll apply with a big kabuki brush. When I mix them with lotion I apply with my hands. Either way make sure your dry before putting on delicate fabrics/ clothes One I want to try is the Ellis Brooklyn Vanilla Milk Shimmering Scented Body Oil 😍 if anyone has tried it, I'd love to hear your thoughts on it."

Há um golpe de Estado sendo aplicado todos os dias no Brasil, em plena luz do sol, por civis que descobriram as atrações de ficar o resto da vida no governo. Estão convencidos que as Forças Armadas vão lhes prestar a assistência que se fizer necessária – em nome do que os golpistas lhes dirão que é “a lei” e encantados por promessas de soldos, aposentadorias, pensões e mais do mesmo. Esse golpe está sendo dado por Lula, pela esquerda radical e pelo STF, mais a Confederação Nacional de Ladrões que se pendura neles todos. Em sua fase atual, e na prática, está sendo aplicado pelos Processos de Brasília contra os supostos líderes do suposto “golpe” de janeiro de 2023. As sentenças de condenação que o STF se prepara para aplicar serão apenas um passo a mais na construção da sua ditadura cada vez menos disfarçada Um país em que o Supremo Tribunal Federal, que tirou Lula da cadeia e formou um consórcio com ele para mandar no governo, elimina a ordem jurídica, é um país governado por um regime de exceção. O Brasil de hoje, é um estado de exceção a caminho de se tornar uma ditadura. Os Processos de Brasília são um passo decisivo nessa caminhada rumo à escuridão. Há pelo menos seis anos, quando abriu um inquérito ilegal que substituiu a Constituição Federal e deu poderes de ditador jurídico a um cidadão que jamais recebeu um voto na vida, o STF começou empurrar o Brasil para a ilegalidade. Com o processo do golpe que não existiu, chegou ao estágio mais avançado da sua intentona. É simples. Os Processos de Brasília estão deixando mais patente do que nunca, e agora na fase do juízo e não mais da investigação, que jamais houve tentativa de golpe no dia 8 de janeiro. Houve só um quebra-quebra sem propósito, sem organização, sem armas, sem liderança e sem a mais remota possibilidade prática de derrubar a diretoria de um clube de carteado. ➡️ JR GUZZO THE NEW YORK TIMES... Operação Lava Jato, que começou no Brasil, revelou um esquema de corrupção que se estendeu por pelo menos 12 países; Supremo Tribunal Federal reverteu grande parte do seu impacto, inclusive soltando Lula, que continua condenado em todas as instâncias jurídicas do país!

Amazon just relaunched Prime for Young Adults Amazon just threw young adults a money-saving lifeline with the return of Prime for Young Adults — a membership specifically created for the 18-24 crowd who want all the Prime perks without the sting of paying full price. This isn't just a regular discount slapped onto existing memberships; it's a completely reimagined program that understands what it's like to be navigating early adulthood on a tight budget. The program kicks off with a six-month free trial,  then continues at half the regular price once the trial ends. After that initial period, members pay just $7.49 monthly or $69 annually. But Prime for Young Adults is also loaded with extra perks that actually matter to younger users, including 5% cash back on beauty, apparel, electronics and personal care purchases. That's money back on the stuff young adults actually buy, from skin care essentials to the latest tech gadgets. The timing couldn't be better, especially with Prime Day approaching. During the July 8-11 Prime Day event, Prime for Young Adults members can earn 10% cash back on eligible purchases in those categories — double the usual rate. Beyond the enhanced cash back, members get access to exclusive surprise experiences, special deals throughout the year and double or triple cash back boosters on popular brands. It's Amazon acknowledging that young adults deserve premium perks even when premium prices aren't in the budget. In this article: Beats Solo 4 and Sol de Janeiro Bum Bum Cream The program goes beyond just saving money on shipping and streaming. It's designed around the reality that people in their late teens and early 20s are building their independence, furnishing first apartments and establishing their personal style — all while managing student loans, entry-level salaries and the general financial chaos of early adulthood. Prime for Young Adults gives them access to the same fast shipping, entertainment options and exclusive deals that regular Prime members enjoy, just at a price that won't demolish their ramen noodle budget. Exclusive offers for Prime for Young Adults today 5% cash back on Beats Solo 4 These wireless on-ear headphones deliver up to 50 hours of listening time with Fast Fuel charging technology.

Instead, Prime Day 2025 will be a 96-hour savings event, meaning for four straight days, Amazon Prime members have the ability to score massive savings on millions of deals. Now while Prime Day is exclusive to Prime members, from now until Prime Day, there are deals you can take advantage of regardless of whether you are a Prime member or not. Every day, Amazon is offering deals on a number of products, so with Prime Day on the horizon, we're being even more attentive to the markdowns on the major retailer's deals section than we have been this year. We've been looking through Amazon's daily deals section, and something we noticed is that while Prime Day isn't live, we're actually seeing some of the best deals taking place right now. How good are those deals? How about “lowest price of the year” good? Below we've highlighted several of those deals that are either matching or at their lowest price of the year as of this writing.

Instead, Prime Day 2025 will be a 96-hour savings event, meaning for four straight days, Amazon Prime members have the ability to score massive savings on millions of deals. Now while Prime Day is exclusive to Prime members, from now until Prime Day, there are deals you can take advantage of regardless of whether you are a Prime member or not. Every day, Amazon is offering deals on a number of products, so with Prime Day on the horizon, we're being even more attentive to the markdowns on the major retailer's deals section than we have been this year. We've been looking through Amazon's daily deals section, and something we noticed is that while Prime Day isn't live, we're actually seeing some of the best deals taking place right now. How good are those deals? How about “lowest price of the year” good? Below we've highlighted several of those deals that are either matching or at their lowest price of the year as of this writing. Related video above: Retailers compare tariff uncertainty to pandemic-era business challenges How did you find these early Prime Day deals? We first looked at Amazon's daily deals page, which is typically labeled “Today's Deals” on Amazon's toolbar if you're viewing on a desktop or laptop computer. Then, we used two third-party tools, CamelCamelCamel and Keepa, to look at the price history associated with an item we've chosen to see whether or not its current price was at or matching the lowest price seen so far this year. Now some products may not be seeing their lowest price of the year right now, but they could either as we get closer to or during Prime Day. We'll be sure to try to keep you updated as best we can, but feel free to use those tools as you look to score the best deal possible for you.

Not to mention, it also makes me buttery soft and hydrated (thanks to coconut and jojoba oil), and it's sun-safe too, with SPF 30. Seriously, I'll be dunking myself in this for the foreseeable future, and I can't wait.” Best Spray: Kopari Sunglaze Sheer Body Mist Sunscreen SPF 42 Courtesy of brand Kopari Sunglaze Sheer Body Mist Sunscreen SPF 42 This super-fine mist doesn't just make your skin shine, it also protects it from damaging UV rays thanks to water-resistant, broad spectrum SPF 42 protection. The quick-drying chemical sunscreen also includes skin-nourishing ingredients like hyaluronic acid, vitamin E and vitamin C. “If you have an outdoor wedding ceremony coming up, this is a great SPF spray. It doesn't feel sticky or heavy on my skin and leaves behind a gorgeous shimmer,” says Glamour senior commerce editor Jenifer Calle. Just make sure to shake the bottle well before applying she says. Best for Wedding: Anastasia Beverly Hills Shimmer Body Oil Courtesy of brand Original photo from Catharine Malzahn testing Anastasia Beverly Hills Shimmer Body Oil Original photo from Catharine Malzahn testing Anastasia Beverly Hills Shimmer Body Oil Anastasia Beverly Hills Shimmer Body Oil Want to stand out from the crowd? Look no further than Anastasia's body oil, which is a bridal favorite amongst online reviewers and friends of our editors. It delivers major shine and comes in three shades–rose gold, white, and gold shimmer. “For super high-impact shimmer, I turn to this almost sparkly body oil from Anastasia Beverly Hills,” says Malzahn. “It sinks into my skin beautifully and is perfect for a beach day, vacation, or special event.” Note that it can transfer onto hands when you're applying it, likely because of just how shimmering it is. Best for Dark Skin: Vaseline Illuminate Me Shimmering Body Oil Courtesy of brand Original photo from Catharine Malzahn testing Vaseline Illuminate Me Shimmering Body Oil Original photo from Catharine Malzahn testing Vaseline Illuminate Me Shimmering Body Oil Vaseline Illuminate Me Shimmering Body Oil Created specifically with melanin-rich skin in mind, Vaseline's shimmery body oil contains hydrating oils like sweet almond oil and a warm coppery finish to avoid ashy skin and deliver warmth. Plus, this budget-friendly formula looks beautiful on all skin tones and skin types, delivering high-impact shine and a healthy glow that commands attention. “It catches the light perfectly,” says Malzahn. “Even though it delivers so much shine, it isn't overpowering whatsoever. Also not overpowering: The light, fresh scent.” Upon application, the product feels more like a watery gel texture than others and spreads very easily (we love that it's non-sticky); a little goes a long way to avoid greasiness. Plus, the brand says it uses responsibly-sourced mica so you can feel good about your glow. Best Hydrating: Moroccanoil Shimmering Body Oil Courtesy of brand Original photo from Catharine Malzahn testing Moroccanoil Shimmering Body Oil Original photo from Catharine Malzahn testing Moroccanoil Shimmering Body Oil Moroccanoil Shimmering Body Oil Sparkly residue on hands and clothes is not an issue with this Moroccanoil formula that comes in a dropper bottle and is a game changer for dry skin. “I love that I don't have to worry about leaving sparkles all over my hands if I apply this body oil,” says Malzahn, who experienced zero transfer. “If anything, it could be more shimmery on my body. It gives my body a good dose of hydration but the shimmer is pretty subtle unless the sun hits my skin just right.” Hydrating, indeed: Thanks to moisturizing ingredients like sesame seed oil and argan oil, this will hydrate your skin all day long. Best Dry Oil: Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Shimmer Multi-Purpose Dry Oil Courtesy of brand Nuxe Huile Prodigieuse Shimmer Multi-Purpose Dry Oil French brand Nuxe makes a golden shimmering dry oil that's loved worldwide, and for good reason. Made with several botanical oils (camellia, macadamia, and argan oils, just to name a few) and boosted with a golden shimmer, Nuxe's oil is dry-touch and many reviewers say it won't leave your body looking or feeling greasy after application (though some disagree)...."

Ormai ogni estate ci prosciuga le illusioni – quest'anno già prima di metà giugno! Cioè: ho realizzato solo l'altro giorno che siamo ancora in primavera!!! – sbattendoci in faccia che, per quanto caldo farà, sarà sempre meno di quello che patiremo in futuro. Ok. Lo sappiamo. Non ditecelo più, vi prego. Intanto lo shopping per il mare si fa necessario: ho deciso di partire per immergermi nel Tirreno e uscire solo prima di raggiungere il livello tracce biologiche rilevate dai Ris di Parma. Qui vedete cosa ho comprato, cosa comprerò in questi giorni e cosa rimarrà nella wishlist finché il santo protettore dei saldi non metterà un 50%. @margo_and_sea@bbcvl Che dire, marzianine e marzianini? Idratatevi, evitate di esporvi al sole nelle ore più calde – Studio Aperto vibes – e fatevi un bel bagno appena potete, che abbiamo il 95% delle acque costiere e lacustri nella classe di qualità eccellente! Cani che viaggiano meglio di me | @pacos.place Shopping per il mare: già comprati, nei desideri e nei piani a breve termine! Costume intero animalier, grande must-have: il tocco wild al mare non guasta mai, anche se il safari sarà ai Bagni Diana di Laigueglia e non alla Diani Beach del Kenya. Maledetto Sol de Janeiro che fa questi spray numerati che inebriano di profumo corpo e capelli! Il mio preferito è il n°87 che sa totalmente di mare e vacanze. La wishlist da Lanapo sarebbe infinita, compresa la crema solare grafica e nostalgica Mi Ricordi il Mare che fa tanto estate italiana. Poco più a destra vedete il berretto con la visiera che merita di oltrepassare i confini liguri perché siamo tutti d'accordo che Focaccia e Mare è un mantra universalmente riconosciuto. Lo stick rosso di Fenty Beauty è il prodotto tutto in uno che ci porta all'aperitivo in spiaggia in modo superlativo: via la salsedine dal viso e stick idratante che colora guance e labbra adattandosi alla pelle per apparire più luminose e curate. Shopping per il mare e per il caldo già avvenuto un paio di anni fa, ce l'ho color crema e mi piace constatare che sia ancora riproposta, ora in versione madreperla: non giudicate la pinza per capelli con le ciliegie perché è necessaria come un lettino in prima fila. Fantastica la t-shirt bianca con la scritta Scandalo al Sole! , dichiara subito che siamo in modalità dolce vita. Vale anche in ufficio. Ok, la t-shirt bianca sta bene con tutto, ma che bella coi pantaloni larghi che mixano colore e cultura, mood vacanziero on. Veniamo alla nota dolente della mia wishilist di inizio estate: l'abito chemisier di Gerard Darel, visto dal vivo in negozio e molto (molto) più bello che in foto. Il prezzo è molto (molto) più brutto di quello che avrei desiderato. H&M che propone spesso degli ottimi costumi da bagno che durano nel tempo, ha in assortimento questo bikini giallo burro in vari modelli e forme di reggiseno e slip: quello coi volants è romantico e delicato come un gelato alla crema. Shopping per il mare che devo fare in presenza, nei camerini, piangendo tutte le lacrime al sapore di carbonara e tiramisù. Preso nel corner coreano del centro commerciale di Arese, per poi scoprire che su Amazon l'avrei pagato meno: lo stick SPF 50 di Beauty of Joseon è da comprare a occhi chiusi. Assolutamente impalpabile e leggero, non lascia alcuna traccia, è la protezione ideale da mettere (e rimettere) durante il giorno, e finalmente ho trovato il prodotto perfetto da utlizzare anche sopra al make-up senza che si disfi tutto. Decenni di successi hanno decretato che chi non possiede un paio di sandali piatti color cuoio, praticamente non vive l'estate chic. Quelli col dettaglio dorato sono essenziali ma hanno quel tocco gold che fa quiet luxury. Vi siete già sventolate in questi giorni? Io sì, con annessi amici che si avvicinano per rinfrescarsi da parassiti. Ecco, nella borsa devo assolutamente aggiungere il ventaglio La Vacanza, alleato contro l'afa da tirare fuori con nonchalance (finché non oserò col ventilatore da collo!).

mov_947469542565DBAFFC8E0C3AAB0D4E63,2025-06-18 10:52:32,en,WEB,"  Home » Latest Travel News of Spain » Wednesday, June 18, 2025 Madrid, Spain's vibrant capital, has seen a dramatic increase in tourism, recording an impressive 3.4 million foreign visitors between January and April 2025. This marks a significant 28.5% rise from the same period last year, solidifying Madrid's position as one of Europe's top tourist destinations. This surge underscores the success of the city's strategic initiatives and its growing appeal among international visitors. The tourism boom is driven by multiple factors, including enhanced marketing strategies, a focus on sustainable travel, and the city's dedication to offering diverse and unique experiences throughout the year. According to the Japan National Tourism Organization (JNTO) and official tourism bodies, such as the Madrid City Council, these numbers reflect the growing demand for both cultural and business tourism in the Spanish capital. Key Factors Driving Growth in Madrid's Tourism Several factors have contributed to the remarkable rise in Madrid's visitor numbers. One of the most significant elements has been the city's active focus on decentralization and deseasonalization of tourism. By promoting lesser-known neighborhoods and attractions beyond the popular central districts, Madrid has successfully spread tourism across the city, ensuring that visitors explore more than just the traditional tourist hotspots. This effort has also helped alleviate congestion in the busiest areas, allowing travelers to enjoy the city's authentic local experiences. Madrid's commitment to sustainable tourism has also played a key role. The city's efforts to introduce greener practices and eco-friendly solutions in tourism and transport have attracted more environmentally conscious travelers. These strategies are aligned with global trends in sustainable travel, where visitors increasingly prefer destinations that are working to reduce their environmental impact. Boost in Ibero-American Markets A significant portion of Madrid's tourism growth is attributed to Ibero-American markets, including Argentina and Brazil. The number of visitors from these countries has increased significantly, with Argentina seeing a rise of 27.3%, and Brazil not far behind with a 21.2% growth. This is a testament to Madrid's continued efforts to strengthen its relationship with Latin America and position itself as the primary European destination for travelers from these regions. As part of its strategic plan, the city has ramped up its promotional activities in key Ibero-American cities such as Buenos Aires, São Paulo, and Rio de Janeiro. These efforts are coupled with Spain's participation in international tourism fairs and events, such as the ILTM Latin America 2025 and España Única conferences, where Madrid is prominently showcased. Digital Transformation and Innovation Another cornerstone of Madrid's tourism growth is its embrace of digitalization. The VisitMadridGPT project, an AI-powered digital assistant, has revolutionized how visitors interact with the city. This tool allows tourists to receive real-time, personalized recommendations, making their visit more engaging and efficient. Additionally, the development of Sustainable Tourism Plans and digital infrastructure to enhance visitor experience has attracted tourists seeking easy access to information and services, thus improving overall satisfaction. Madrid City Council's proactive steps in promoting digital travel and hospitality services are further solidifying the capital's status as a smart city for tourism. Major Events and Sports Tourism Madrid's role as a hub for sports tourism has further boosted its global appeal. In 2025, the city will host some of the world's most exciting events, such as the Formula 1 Grand Prix in September and the NFL regular season games in November. These events attract thousands of international visitors, further cementing Madrid's position as a top destination for sports tourism. The city's hosting of the Madrid Marathon, which brought together 45,000 runners from 118 countries, further demonstrates Madrid's ability to attract large-scale international events that generate substantial economic benefits. The marathon, with 27% of its participants coming from overseas, had an estimated economic impact of €64.5 million. Decentralization and Cultural Expansion Madrid's tourism strategy has focused on decentralizing tourism to avoid overcrowding in the city's most popular areas, such as Gran Vía and Puerta del Sol. Through campaigns like “Te faltan calles” (“You're Missing Streets”), the city is highlighting 22 new tourist areas, with plans to add nine more. These efforts encourage tourists to explore Madrid's lesser-known districts, enriching their experience while supporting local businesses and cultural heritage. In addition to these efforts, Madrid continues to promote itself as a world leader in Spanish-language musicals and cultural events. With new performances, exhibitions, and festivals planned throughout the year, Madrid is becoming a cultural hotspot for visitors seeking unique artistic experiences. The city's work to preserve and celebrate its cultural heritage while embracing modern developments creates a diverse tourism offering that appeals to a wide range of travelers. Looking Toward the Future: Sustainable Tourism Plans Madrid is committed to sustainability and is implementing several initiatives to reduce the environmental footprint of its tourism sector. The RESIDE Plan, which focuses on regulating tourist housing and protecting the local business community, was approved to manage the growth of short-term rentals and preserve Madrid's unique neighborhoods. Additionally, Madrid has set ambitious goals to reduce the carbon footprint of its tourism sector, investing in green energy projects and sustainable infrastructure. The Sustainable Tourism Plan, which is funded by NextGenerationEU resources, aims to track, reduce, and offset the carbon emissions associated with tourism. Madrid is one of the first cities in Europe to receive technical assistance for carbon measurement and reduction projects in tourism. Conclusion: A Bright Future for Madrid's Tourism Madrid's tourism sector has demonstrated remarkable resilience and growth in 2025, attracting millions of visitors from around the world. The city's focus on decentralization, digital innovation, cultural promotion, and sustainable tourism has positioned it as a global leader in the travel industry. With continued efforts to promote sustainability and expand its global reach, Madrid is set to remain a top destination for international visitors. As the city continues to host major events and strengthen its international ties, the future looks bright for Madrid's tourism sector...."

Rajskie ptaki, soczyste owoce i drinki z palemką. Jeżeli z tym kojarzą wam się najlepsze wojaże, wybierzcie tę mgiełkę, która przeniesie was w cudowny czas każdego dnia. [So...? Pina Colada Mgiełka Zapachowa - jak pachnie?] Mgiełka So...? Pina Colada znajduje się w opakowaniu z wygodnym atomizerem, który świetnie rozpyla mgiełkę. Jest lekka, bardzo ożywcza i niezwykle tropikalna. Soczyste ananasy mieszają się z wodą i mleczkiem kokosowym, które jest otulone ziarnami wanilii. Dość długo się utrzymuje i pachnie jak Sol de Janeiro Agua Mistica. W niej również znajdziecie akordy ananasa, kokosa, kwiatu pomarańczy oraz dojrzałych w słońcu mandarynek. Mgiełka jest 10x tańsza i zdecydowanie jest warta uwagi. Nie ułatwię wam wyboru - do zgarnięcia jest więcej nut zapachowych, które pachną tak, jak serie Sol de Janeiro. Sami sprawdźcie! [Opinie użytkowników] Ten zapach to synonim lata i najlepszych słonecznych wakacji nad wodą. Powiew ananasa i kokosa jest wyraźnie wyczuwalny. Sprawdźcie, jak wypowiada się o nim jedna z użytkowniczek: Mgiełka ma umiarkowaną projekcję i trwałość, a buteleczka jest bardzo poręczna i idealnie nadaje się do torebki. Jeśli chodzi o sam zapach, to jest on typowo letni. Wyraźnie czuć klimaty pinacolady, czyli ananasa, kokosa i różne egzotyczne owoce, ale wyczuwa się również aromat drinku, przez co może niektórym użytkowniczkom nie za bardzo odpowiadać (pachnie dosłownie jak drink, nawet po odparowaniu alkoholu). wspomina użytkowniczka na łamach Kosmetyku Wszech Czasów [Ten tani balsam o zapachy koktajlu pina colada pachnie przez kilka godzin] Pina colada to jeden z moich ulubionych zapachów oraz letnich drinków bezalkoholowych na bazie wody kokosowej. Perfumy czy mgiełki świetnie się spisują w ciągu dnia. Natomiast kocham podbijać ten efekt i smaruję ciało balsamem, który sprawia, że ciało jest nawilżone, gładkie i pachnie jak świeżo zerwany ananas na Azorach! Zawartość aloesu dogłębnie nawilża skórę, a konsystencja sorbetu pomaga lepiej wchłaniać się w skórę.

Apesar do estouro de filmes como ""Ainda Estou Aqui"" e ""Homem com H"" nos últimos tempos, a produção audiovisual tem mais de um século, com os primeiros registros em movimento feitos no final da década de 1890.  Desde então, o cinema nacional possui uma vasta produção que fez um registro pela história do Brasil nesses mais de 100 anos. Em 2015, a Associação Brasileira de Críticos de Cinema elegeu os 100 melhores filmes de todos os tempos. Para a data, veja 5 filmes da lista que estão disponíveis no streaming: ""Deus e o Diabo na Terra do Sol"" (1964) Dirigido por Glauber Rocha, a produção é considerada como um marco do Cinema Novo. Na trama, o vaqueiro Manuel foge com sua esposa depois de matar o coronel Moraes. Enquanto tenta escapar dos jagunços do coronel, o casal se junta aos seguidores do beato Sebastião, que promete uma vida melhor a partir de um catolicismo místico. Disponível no Globoplay e Telecine. ""Cabra Marcado para Morrer"" (1984) O documentário assinado por Eduardo Coutinho, nasce quando o realizador tem a ideia de fazer um filme de ficção com base na história real do assassinato em 1962 de João Pedro Teixeira, um dos fundadores da Liga Camponesa de Sapé, na Paraíba. Produzido ao longo de 22 anos, Coutinho optou por usar como atores camponeses que viviam na região das filmagens. Você pode assistir no Globoplay e no Curta! On. ""Cidade de Deus"" (2002) Dirigido por Fernando Meirelles, o longa acompanha a vida de Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues), um jovem pobre e negro que mora na comunidade Cidade de Deus, considerada uma das regiões mais violentas no Rio de Janeiro. Disponível no Globoplay, Max, Netflix, Paramount +, Telecine e para aluguel no YouTube. Em 2024, Alexandre Rodrigues retornou para o papel para a série ""Cidade de Deus: a Luta Não Para"", da Max. ""O Bandido da Luz Vermelha"" (1968) Um assaltante que comete crimes em residências e se arrisca em fugas ousadas é apelidado de Bandido da Luz Vermelha pela imprensa sensacionalista. Dirigido por Rogério Sganzerla, a produção pode ser encontrar no streaming gratuito Itaú Cultural Play. Aclamado pela crítica nacional e internacional, o que rendeu uma indicação ao Oscar de Melhor Atriz para Fernanda Montenegro, ""Central do Brasil"" traz a história de Dora (Montenegro), uma professora aposentada que trabalha como escritora de cartas na Estação Central do Brasil, que passa a ajudar Josué, uma criança que busca pelo seu pai no Nordeste. Disponível na Netflix, Globoplay, Prime Video e para aluguel no YouTube."

Cualquiera se familiariza con el evento desde que llega al aeropuerto, si está de visita, o al transitar los cautivantes caminos, donde las publicidades alusivas invitan a no perderse ningún detalle de la cita internacional. Es un fin de semana largo donde los cariocas están en modo deportivo. Por el Mundial de Clubes que se juega en los Estados Unidos, donde participan tres equipos de fútbol de la ciudad, Flamengo, Fluminense y Botafogo, lo que hace que sus fanáticos luzcan esas camisetas por las calles, bares y playas. Y por las carreras: en la pista del hipódromo de Gávea se corre el Gran Premio Brasil, la máxima competencia del turf local, este domingo, después de disfrutar cuatro días a toda velocidad de los atletas en sus calles. En rigor, la Maratón de Río de Janeiro es la mayor carrera de calle de América Latina y este año alcanza un récord increíble: 60.000 corredores –un 33% más que en 2024– distribuidos en cinco pruebas (5K, 10K, 21K, 42K y el Desafío Cidade Maravilhosa, que consiste en la sumatoria de las dos carreras más extensas, en las mañanas del sábado y domingo). Un detalle: las mujeres son mayoría en las tres primeras competencias. Todo eso en medio de un ambiente pintoresco fantástico, en jornadas consecutivas desde este jueves, antes de caer el sol. El keniata Josphat Kiprotich volverá a competir en la 42K, la prueba que obtuvo en 2024 y en la que tiene el récord de la distancia - Créditos: @Prensa Maratón do Rio Hay estrellas locales e internacionales. El keniata Josphat Kiprotich es el campeón defensor de la especialidad y ostenta el récord de 2h12m35/1000 para los 42K. Su compatriota Joshua Kipkemboi Kogo se subió al podio en Praga el mes pasado. El etíope Yemane Tsegay Adhane es una leyenda. El paulista Ederson Vilela Pereira tuvo su primera participación fuera de las fronteras en Mar del Plata en 2006 en un torneo Sub 18, fue campeón panamericano de los 10.000 metros llanos en Lima 2019 y viene de llegar primero en la media Maratón corrida el 25 de mayo en Orla de Itaipuaçu, en otra zona costera de Río. Justino Pedro da Silva ya ganó dos veces la Maratón de Río (2011/2012), dejó su huella en Venezuela hace dos años y mantiene la ambición intacta. PUBLICIDAD La etíope Zinash Debebe Getachew ya sabe lo que significa ganar la 42k femenina en esta ciudad: fue primera en 2023. La keniata Rael Cherop Boiyo corrió su primera Maratón en diciembre pasado en Torino, obtuvo la prueba y, a los 24 años, ya aparece entre las máximas referentes. Amanda Aparecida de Oliveira fue bicampeona brasileña Sub 23 y hoy, a los 28, busca revancha tras quedar segunda el año pasado en los 42K. El sueño de miles de atletas vuelve a Río de Janeiro, donde habrá cinco pruebas en cuatro días entre la tarde del jueves y la mañana del domingo - Créditos: @Prensa Maratón do Rio Entre los argentinos, Marcela Cristina Gómez Cordeiro, que correrá la maratón completa y posee una marca de 2h34m3s lograda en Valencia, España, en 2023, y Alan Esteban Niestroj, el campeón argentino de los 10.000 metros que competirá en los 21K, forman parte del pelotón de elite y llegan con buenas expectativas. Un puñado de nombres entre tantos consagrados que dicen presente. Denise Amaral, de 62 años, va a afrontar su Maratón número 200 en Río, anticipan desde la organización. Es un verdadero hito para quien ya corrió en varias ocasiones la que se desarrolla en la capital argentina y recibió, además, la medalla Mega Finisher por haber completado las maratones de Buenos Aires, Lima, Asunción, Montevideo y Brasilia. Desde su primera experiencia, en 1983, lo intentó en más de 30 ciudades y 15 países, aunque su mayor proeza resulta la enseñanza que deja en las generaciones más jóvenes que la toman de ejemplo de vida. Fue la primera mujer en el planeta en recibir la medalla del circuito World Marathon Majors, conformado por las carreras de Berlín, Boston, Chicago, Londres, Nueva York y Tokio. Llegó a la meta en todas ellas. Épico. Las carreras que conforman el festival de atletismo de Río están acompañadas de entretenimientos y shows para toda la familia - Créditos: @Prensa Maratón de Río La competencia principal, la del domingo desde las 5 de la mañana, atravesará barrios famosos como Leblon, Ipanema, Copacabana, Botafogo y Flamengo a lo largo de un recorrido que incluye 26,2km que bordean las hermosas playas cariocas. En su ruta hacia la meta, los atletas acelerarán en medio de un paisaje atrapante, entre el océano y las montañas, donde gran parte del camino podrán decir que tienen la bendición del Cristo Redentor, ese ícono cultural que se alza imponente en la cima del cerro Corcovado, a poco más de 700m sobre el nivel del mar. Una cita maravillosa a los pies de una de las siete maravillas del mundo. Hay subidas y bajadas, al ritmo de la samba y la bossa nova. El evento trasciende las horas de competencia. Desde la tarde del miércoles, Río de Janeiro es un festival musical, gastronómico, cultural, deportivo y con espacios de entretenimiento para toda la familia a cielo abierto. Impulsa el turismo y la economía. Esta edición reparte en premios 312.000 reales (unos 56.000 dólares), una cifra récord que incluye bonificaciones por batir plusmarcas. En 2024, la Maratón de Río generó un impacto estimado en 64 millones de dólares y la generación de unos 2800 empleos. En esta oportunidad, los shows, las tiendas de 35 marcas y los puntos de encuentro se extienden en la zona de la Explanada de la Marina y el Aterro de Flamengo, allí donde está la inmensa bahía de Guanabara. Una vía rápida para el transporte que esta vez lo será, además, para las decenas de miles de atletas, la mayoría de ellos residentes fuera de esta metrópoli."

mynk6jx,2025-06-19 16:14:16,en,REDDIT,"  Some of my favorite affordable fragrances that smell higher end. Now my disclaimer is that I wear whatever scents I want all year long so I'm not always the best at saying what's good in warm vs cold weather 😂 I also recommend spraying your clothes if you don't mind doing that. Bath and Body Works Midnight Temptation, pair it with the lotion to up longevity. It's very similar to Black Opium Le Parfum. Just spray the heck out of your body and clothes. Sol De Janeiro the edt paired with 62 body spray. This is actually a summer scent for me, so I get the 8ml in the edt and a small body spray, theis will be about $40 to $50 for both, but the sprays go on sale a lot. If you can swing a small bum bum cream and the glow oil, I highly recommend. This is a compliment getter! I wouldn't recommend blind buying but a lot of Mancera perfumes are crazy strong. I got a 4oz of Roses vanille on Jomashop for $60ish. I've barely made a dent cuz she's strong! Lattafa Liam Grey less than $25 for 100 ml bottle. This is a dupe for BDK Gris Chanel, but it's stronger and longer lasting. This smells like money, but I would recommend testing out the OG to see if you like that scent DNA. Adam Levine, around $15 but I've seen it way lower. This smells way more expensive than what it is and it projects. Avon Imari Elixir. It smells niche. You can find it on EBay with free delivery for less than  $15. If you are a fan of roses- French Avenue Rose Explosion. This is like being at the flower shop and you walk in right as they are cutting down the rosettes to make a bouquet, you smell  fresh petals, leaves, and stems. It's a dupe for atomic rose. $22 on Amazon Paris Hilton Gold Rush pair it with the body spray. It smells really good, the best in the line. You can get both, 100 ml perfume and 8oz spray for less than $40 on Amazon. Guess Seductive Noir. So good. Very similar to Mon Guerlain. $22 for a 2.5 0z bottle and $13 for the body spray on Amazon. People rave about this fragrance and it deserves all the hype! Narciso Rodriguez has a lot of great perfumes $60 or under. I really like For Her edt and Musc Noir Rose (this would probably be too musky), the projection is good on both, stays on clothes until you wash them. Lattafa Mayar Natural Intense. A freshy that projects and has some longevity. $20 on Amazon. Lattafa Angham. This is beautifully done. And it projects and lasts longer than Burberry Goddess. $30ish on Amazon. Lastly if you really want to project and you don't get headaches try Ciara by Revlon. She's strong and surprisingly unique. Less than $15 on Amazon. You can probably find some of these even cheaper but Im addicted to 2 day shipping"

mov_CB29BF99773538923DDE400DEA3318CF,2025-06-19 18:48:20,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]La joya de Rocafonda se encuentra por segunda vez con su ídolo para hacer travesuras en Río de Janeiro Ni Alex Padilla ni Anna Gegnoso: la influencer que pasó sus vacaciones con Lamine Yamal y le saca 13 años Lamine Yamal ya no puede dar un paso sin tener la cámara de un paparazzi pendiente de sus movimientos. Como desveló Culemanía, la joya de Rocafonda se relajó unos días en Sicilia junto a la influencer Fati Vázquez, de 29 años. De vuelta a Barcelona, la estrella del FC Barcelona celebró el 39 cumpleaños de su padre, Mounir Nasraoui, en el restaurante Gaudim de Barcelona. A un mes de regresar al trabajo para el comienzo de la pretemporada, la joya de la Masía no desaprovecha ni un minuto y ha vuelto a partir, rumbo a Brasil. En las playas brasileñas, ha hecho sus primeros pinitos con el surf, instruido por Gabriel Medina, tricampeón mundial de la disciplina. Otro fenómeno precoz que en 2014, con 20 años, conquistó su primer título. Ya de paso, el prodigio del Barça se ha citado con una leyenda azulgrana durante su estancia en Sudamérica. Cita de estrellas Como estaba previsto, Lamine se ha reunido con Neymar Jr, el ídolo de su infancia. El barcelonismo recuerda las gambetas de Ney cada vez que el 19 baila con el balón en los pies. La magia se ha juntado en Brasil. Concretamente, en un campo de fútbol playa, como ha mostrado el delantero de 33 años en una historia de Instagram. El crack azulgrana toca balón en bañador, con el pelo tintado de rubio y un moreno fruto de estas primeras semanas bajo el sol. Lamine ha resubido la historia de su amigo en su perfil, y también ha dado pistas de dónde podría haber disputado la pachanga futbolística. En otra story el joven extremo ha compartido su ubicación en Río de Janeiro. Ambos exponentes del regate tuvieron un primer encuentro en los Globe Soccer Awards, a finales de 2024. Aquel mismo año, el buque insignia del Barça reconoció en una entrevista con la Liga que idolatra a la estrella paulista desde pequeño: ""Mi ídolo de la infancia era Neymar, era a quien admiraba y de quien veía todos los vídeos que había. Messi, obviamente, para mí, siempre ha sido el mejor. Pero es verdad que la manera de ser y de jugar de Neymar me encantaba""."

A fan-fave Laneige lip mask, which honestly requires no introduction. Enriched with vitamin C, coconut oil, shea butter, and antioxidants, it nourishes and protects your lips while giving them a supple, glossy finish. It's a splurge-worthy staple you'll probably love as much as the reviewer who called it ""absolute magic."" BTW, some people use it as a daily lip balm or lip protectant over their lipstick too! Laneige is an Asian-owned brand that has been in the beauty game for years. (Seriously, since the 90s!) The luxury brand prides itself on being affordable too, and has many fan favorite products because of it. Promising reviews: ""I'd have a hard time pulling the trigger on this for the coat, but when you have seasonally dry lip irritation you can't escape, you get desperate. I finally decided to splurge, glad I did! A little goes a long way so should last a good while, and never had a quicker turnaround on fixing dry lips. My kids are now asking for it, definitely worth the splurge."" —Michelle Get it from Amazon for $24 (available in seven scents). 2. And a lightweight, moisture-coating Laneige Lip Glowy Balm packed with murumuru (a palm native to the Amazon) and shea butter, making it the perfect daytime partner in crime to the cult-favorite lip sleeping mask. Be careful using this around your besties, because they *will* be asking if they can have some. Check out how all the colors look when applied in this TikTok! Promising review: ""Yes, it's a pricy lip gloss. I splurged on one of these and a lip mask, just to see what all the hype is about and...it's valid. Very valid. Ridiculously valid. This lip gloss goes on thick like a luxe gloss, but smooth like an oil. Lots of slip on the lip and absolutely zero stickiness. It also lasts for hours where most lip gloss is gone with one sip of water. It is, seriously, the best lip gloss that I've ever used."" —DarlingBlueEyes Get it from Amazon for $19 (available in nine scents). 3. A wildly popular Olaplex repairing treatment, which is the OG when it comes to products that help strengthen your locks. It features a highly concentrated formula designed to help rebuild breakage, reduce split ends, and prevent future damage. Plus, reviewers rave about the fast results! BTW, it has over 99,000 5-star ratings! Promising reviews: ""Worth the splurge. If you are thinking about trying this, DO IT! I know it's a bit expensive for such a small bottle but it's so worth it. I color my hair, but I also have just dry sometimes frizzy curly hair. I use this about once a month, as recommended by my curly hair specialist. Use it before you shampoo and condition. The result is amazing, my hair is so soft and my curly are so bouncy after using it."" —Bcampbell Get it from Amazon for $30. 4. A super effective high-frequency wand, because it's a whole skincare system wrapped up into one truly powerful, multi-talented tool. This wand helps boost cell metabolism through increased energy production and blood circulation. Consider it a workout for your skin! It can help you achieve your most elusive, radiant complexion. ✨ To use on skin while preventing irritation, simply apply a generous layer of water-based serum, place your index finger on the glass tube, turn the device on, touch the glass tube's tip to your skin, then remove your finger and glide the tube across your skin...."

mov_2A261792F0ABDDF38B4A716BCFBB37B6,2025-06-21 14:47:41,pt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]DA ASSESSORIA DE IMPRENSA  “Araguaia”, longa documental do cineasta e escritor tocantinense Hermes Leal, teve sua estreia nacional no dia  de 19 de junho, data na qual celebramos o “Dia do Cinema Brasileiro”. Depois de percorrer o circuito de salas do Norte e Centro-Oeste, o filme será lançado em outras regiões brasileiras. Com distribuição da Jalapão Filmes e narração do ator Paulo Betti, o documentário reconstrói a desconhecida Guerrilha do Araguaia, com relatos de militares e ex-guerrilheiros, que saíram do anonimato para relatar torturas e mortes, em um dos maiores extermínios de  pessoas na história do Brasil. O longa-metragem, construído a partir do seriado documental para TV “Guerra do Araguaia”, denuncia e reconstitui o massacre de 69 pessoas que faziam parte da Guerrilha do Araguaia,  ocorrida entre 1972 e 1974, na floresta amazônica no sul do Pará. Pela primeira vez, militares assumem seus crimes e descrevem em detalhes como mataram dezenas de pessoas a sangue  frio. No conflito, houve a maior mobilização de tropas no Brasil desde a Guerra do Paraguai e a Segunda Guerra Mundial; as forças militares utilizaram cerca de sete mil homens para combater e eliminar os guerrilheiros. “Araguaia” revela a verdade dos fatos, de forma a jogar luz sobre um dos episódios mais obscuros da História do Brasil, ainda no anonimato. Por isso, relata, cronologicamente, os  cinco anos de preparação e os dois anos de combates desta sangrenta guerra, com  depoimentos de militares (coronéis e soldados); documentos secretos; relatos inéditos de guerrilheiros, que há mais de 40 anos vivem no anonimato; de camponeses, que foram  torturados e mortos tanto quanto os guerrilheiros; e contextualizada por historiadores e jornalistas especializados no assunto. O filme aborda todo o período dos combates, mostrando fatos inéditos dos dois lados do conflito, dos militares e dos guerrilheiros, e como dezenas de militantes do PC do B, vindos  do Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Ceará e Bahia, enfrentaram um Exército bem armado, que precisou de três grandes campanhas para derrotar, decapitar e exterminar guerrilheiros mal  armados, mas adaptados à selva. Até hoje, os militares não informaram o destino dos corpos de 49 pessoas desaparecidas no conflito. Os depoimentos dos sobreviventes, oito guerrilheiros, que estão vivos porque foram presos  no início do conflito, ou conseguiram escapar no calor dos combates, antes do massacre final, dão um teor real aos acontecimentos do dia a dia da guerrilha. Suas façanhas foram  presenciadas por camponeses, que sofreram nas mãos dos militares tanto quanto os guerrilheiros, e até hoje mantêm suas cicatrizes e a presença dos amigos guerrilheiros em  suas vidas. Filmado nas locações onde os eventos ocorreram, na região entre Marabá (sul do Pará) e  Xambioá (norte do Tocantins), “Araguaia” busca, em seu conjunto e seus desdobramentos,compreender o que foi este fato histórico do país. Foram necessários meses de investigação para localizar e convencer guerrilheiros e militares a quebrar seus silêncios e revelar tudo o que foi mantido em segredo até hoje. Até os dias atuais, nenhum militar havia assumido seus crimes publicamente, nem detalhado suas operações de guerra. Coronel Lício, por  exemplo, um dos personagens do filme, pode ser considerado a pessoa que mais matou durante todo o regime militar. O longa revela também um dos maiores centros de tortura do país, senão o maior, por onde passaram mais pessoas torturadas, chamado Casa Azul,  que até hoje se mantém de pé na periferia de Marabá como uma memória viva das  atrocidades cometidas lá dentro. E encerra com um diagnóstico sobre a busca da verdade, a  punição dos responsáveis pelas atrocidades – ainda há 49 corpos desaparecidos –, e a dor  de quem perdeu seus amigos e parentes. A narrativa reconstrói, cronologicamente, os sete anos de conflito, revelando os antecedentes, os treinamentos, as campanhas militares, até iniciar os combates, onde os militares e seus guias descrevem com detalhes como mataram, por exemplo, a guerrilheira Sônia, com oitenta tiros. Este evento é relatado pelos militares que a executaram, sendo que  um deles carrega até hoje uma cicatriz do tiro recebido no rosto por Sônia antes de morrer.Relatam também a morte de vários outros guerrilheiros em cenas sangrentas, incluindo a decapitação dos corpos dos mortos, que lembram uma carnificina.  .

The padded face hole and arm holes make it easy to read or be on your phone while lounging and tanning on your stomach! Check it out on TikTok here! Promising review: ""This is the most comfortable beach chair! I absolutely love it. My main complaint with all the beach chairs that I've ever had is that you can't lie face down comfortably. Either the bars hit across the hips, the chair doesn't recline correctly, your arms end up in an awkward position and you always have to turn your head to the side. It's a major topic of conversation in my friend group. Well, This company has been listening to us! I have zero complaints! When I lie face down, there's a nifty hole cut out with padding that is very comfortable for my face, there's cutouts for my arms to slip through…great for playing on my phone or reading a book, the back and seat part must be a tad longer than most chairs because the bars do not hit my hip bones at all. And I REALLY like the footrest! The material is super durable and easy to clean up. Several of my friends have bought one after trying mine out. As you can tell, I HIGHLY recommend this chair!"" —Hannah Jane Get it from Amazon for $129.99+ (available in 10 colors). 2. Or, a waterproof and portable inflatable lounger if you want a seating option that's easy to carry to and from the beach and easy to set up.

Perhaps most importantly for larger fams — it comes in a *ton* of different colors, so everyone will always know which one is ""theirs."" Check it out on TikTok here! Promising review: ""Super easy to use and sooo comfy. Lightweight, sand doesn't stick, and you can float in the water. They can fly away, so attach to something if it's windy.

A set of sunscreen reminder stickers that'll tell you when it's time to reapply, because PSA, one application at the start of the day is not enough to prevent sunburn. Plus, they last up to 12 hours and are even waterproof! Sooo...how does it work? It's simple: If the sticker is clear, you're in the clear (aka, your sunscreen is working). As soon as the sticker turns purple, it's time to reapply. Then, after you do, it will turn back to clear. Check out a TikTok of the sunscreen stickers in action. Promising review: ""After yet another bad sunburn, even though I'm trying VERY HARD to keep sunscreen on, I bought these. First use was at Disneyland on a 90-degree, zero-clouds day. This helped so much! I kept an eye (as did my friends) on the dot, so we all knew when to reapply sunscreen and not one of us got burned. I also used these on a weeklong hiking adventure in Utah, which was also in the 90s with an extreme UV index. None of us got burned, so all in all, this is one of the best inventions!"" —Catherine Shock Get two packs from Amazon for $25.99. 4...."

Brasileira que caiu à beira de um vulcão, na Indonésia, está há mais de 48 horas à espera de socorro O cenário é descrito como ""de outro mundo"" por turistas: chão de cascalhos, nuvens baixas e a vista para o lago Sinara Anak, no entorno do vulcão Rinjani, na Indonésia. Mas a beleza da trilha de dois dias de duração contrasta com o drama vivido pela brasileira Juliana Marins, que desapareceu após um acidente no local. Juliana tem 26 anos, é de Niterói, no Rio de Janeiro, formada em publicidade pela Universidade Federal do Rio de Janeiro. Nadadora e praticante de pole dance, ela decidiu embarcar em uma aventura sozinha pela Ásia. Passou por Filipinas, Vietnã e Tailândia até chegar à Indonésia, no fim de fevereiro. No país, juntou-se a um grupo de cinco turistas e um guia para escalar o Monte Rinjani, com mais de 3 mil metros de altura. A italiana Federica Matricardi, que conheceu Juliana um dia antes da trilha, relembrou o esforço da subida e a decepção com a vista encoberta por neblina. Elas acamparam e retomaram a trilha na madrugada seguinte, por volta de 5h15. ""Estava muito frio, e foi muito difícil (...) começamos a caminhar juntas e alguns rapazes foram mais rápido"", lembra. Federica seguiu à frente, acompanhada de outros turistas, enquanto Juliana caminhava com o guia, logo atrás. O francês Antoine Le Gac, também do grupo, contou que as condições eram ruins: ainda estava escuro, com pouca visibilidade e o terreno era escorregadio, iluminado apenas por lanternas. ""Durante a trilha, tínhamos diferenças de nível. (...) no momento do acidente, eu estava bem na frente. Ela estava sozinha com o guia. Era muito cedo, antes do sol nascer, em condições de visão ruins, com uma simples lanterna para iluminar terrenos difíceis, escorregadios"" Segundo autoridades locais, Juliana teria caído cerca de 300 metros abaixo da trilha, perto do ponto mais alto da montanha. Horas depois, outro grupo chegou ao local e, com ajuda de um drone, a localizou. A brasileira estava presa em uma fresta da pedra, com dificuldade para se mover. Vestia calça jeans, camiseta, luvas e tênis — sem agasalho, apesar do frio intenso, e sem os óculos, fundamentais para sua visão, pois tinha cinco graus de miopia. A notícia do acidente chegou ao Brasil na sexta-feira (20), por uma rede social. A irmã de Juliana, Mariana Marins, inicialmente duvidou da informação, mas reconheceu a jovem pelas roupas e pelo rosto nas imagens. Desde então, a família vive à espera de respostas e enfrenta dificuldades para obter informações confiáveis à distância. “A verdade é que, a gente descobriu isso em contato com pessoas que trabalham no parque, é que a Juliana estava nesse grupo de cinco pessoas, sim, com um guia. Porém, a Juliana ficou muito cansada, pediu pra parar um pouco (...) eles seguiram em frente. O guia não ficou com ela. (...) As informações que a gente tem também, vindas do parque, são de que a Juliana entrou em desespero porque não sabia o que fazer — e aí acabou culminando no sumiço dela. Quando percebeu que ela estava demorando muito, ele chegou. Ele chegou e viu que ela tinha caído lá embaixo"" Além da angústia, a família ainda precisou lidar com informações falsas. A irmã da vítima recebeu um vídeo que sugeria que Juliana já havia sido resgatada e recebido comida e água. A informação foi desmentida mais tarde. ""Chegamos a comemorar. Foi um choque descobrir que era mentira"", contou a irmã. O embaixador do Brasil na Indonésia admitiu, em ligação registrada pelo Fantástico, que repassou informações incorretas no início, com base em relatos imprecisos das autoridades locais. Ele afirmou ainda que a equipe de resgate chegou ao local onde Juliana tinha sido vista, mas ela já não estava mais lá. As buscas foram ampliadas com o uso de drones térmicos, mas uma forte neblina interrompeu a operação. Juliana estava há mais de 48 horas à espera de resgate. Cada minuto fazia diferença diante das condições extremas da montanha. Mariana, que se manteve em contato com autoridades, amigos e voluntários, disse que continuava acreditando: ""Eu acredito que minha irmã está viva."" Juliana Marins caiu à beira de um vulcão, na Indonésia, está há mais de 48 horas à espera de socorro.

Las firmas premium encontraron en la plataforma una vía para controlar precios. El auge del comercio electrónico impulsa el segmento en América Latina. Amazon está reenfocando su estrategia en productos de belleza premium como una forma de elevar sus utilidades y atenuar el impacto de aumentos en aranceles. Según datos de NielsenIQ, las ventas en la categoría Amazon Premium Beauty crecieron casi un 20% entre abril de 2024 y abril de 2025, alcanzando los 15,000 millones de dólares, por encima del 14% del resto de la belleza en línea, analizan en Reuters . Estos productos, por su precio elevado y tamaño compacto, ofrecieron mayores márgenes: pueden enviarse fácilmente y generan comisiones extras (hasta 15% sobre cada venta), lo cual beneficia tanto a Amazon como a las marcas participantes. Mientras que otras categorías (como electrónica o moda) suelen aplicar descuentos del 14% a 22% en eventos como Prime Day, la belleza premium se mantuvo con rebajas menores de entre 10% y 17%. Durante el Prime Day de 2024 , Amazon generó ingresos récord de 14,200 millones de dólares, colocando a la belleza de lujo en un lugar privilegiado dentro de sus estrategias de promoción y marketing. Amazon: control de imagen y percepción de las marcas premium Al inicio, Amazon era vista con recelo por marcas como Estée Lauder y L'Oréal, inquietas por un posible impacto negativo en su imagen. Sin embargo, la presencia de estas firmas en Amazon Premium Beauty cambió el panorama. Ahora, L'Oréal dice que las ofertas en Amazon impulsaron su participación en el mercado estadounidense. Estée Lauder, en tanto, lanzó 11 marcas en la plataforma desde marzo de 2024 y garantiza que más del 75% de sus productos en Estados Unidos provienen de ese país o Canadá, lo que los exime de nuevos aranceles. Este viraje no sólo permite que las marcas mantuvieran control sobre su pricing e inventario, sino que también atraigan a un perfil de consumidor más adulto y de mayor poder adquisitivo. En otras palabras, Etsy Beauty, L'Oréal y Dyson encontraron en Amazon un aliado para sumar volumen sin sacrificar prestigio. Auge del comercio electrónico y oportunidades en Latinoamérica La expansión del segmento premium de belleza coincide con un auge del comercio electrónico, cuya proporción en la venta total de cuidado personal en Estados Unidos llegó a 41%. Se espera que el mercado global de belleza crezca desde 430,000 millones de dólares en 2022 hasta 580,000 millones en 2027, dicen en Bluehost . En América Latina el mercado de belleza alcanzó los 61,400 millones de dólares en 2022, destacando a Brasil como cuarto a nivel mundial y a México entre los tres primeros de la región, según VogueBusiness . A su vez, el incremento proyectado para la región es de alrededor de 3.5 % anual entre 2022 y 2025. Marcas latinoamericanas como Sol de Janeiro y Nopalera están capitalizando la presencia digital para ganar visibilidad más allá de sus fronteras, apoyadas en ingredientes nativos como el nopal o acai. Varias razones convergieron para que Amazon apueste por el lujo: Márgenes y logística : Los artículos de belleza premium generan alto margen por su valor y bajo costo de envío. Aranceles y origen local : Una gran parte de productos premium proviene de Norteamérica, evadiendo nuevos impuestos. Percepción cambiada : Marcas de lujo ya no temen asociarse con Amazon; ven valor en su control de imagen, inventario y precios. Crecimiento del ecommerce: La digitalización aceleró la compra de belleza, incluso en Latinoamérica.

mov_D0BBA8BFF663B694F79EB1B9E1158184,2025-06-23 23:35:00,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Está circulando una estafa en la que roban datos y dinero a cambio de prometer una caja de productos de belleza, aparentando ser de Farmacity. Alertate. Hay una estafa que está circulando sobre una supuesta caja misteriosa de productos de belleza de alta gama aparentando ser de la reconocida cadena Farmacity. A través de las redes sociales, viralizan esta ""ganga imperdible"" de la cual hay que estar alerta ya que muchos cayeron hasta el momento. ¿En qué consiste? Los estafadores se las ingenian cada vez más fácil para lograr su cometido. En este caso por tan sólo $1.700 o $2.000 y completar una simple encuesta ""te llegará de regalo una caja repleta de productos para disfrutar"". Utilizan el logo de la empresa y hasta fotos de tickets (truchos) que hacen que la gente caiga. El link se encuentra oculto y una vez que los interesados ingresan, deben completar una encuesta con todos sus datos y el costo de la sorpresa es únicamente el envío de esta ""caja misteriosa"" (como la llaman los estafadores). Luego, prometen que te llega a tu hogar con productos importados que Farmacity ni siquiera comercializa. La estafa viene dando vueltas hace algunos meses, por lo que es importante viralizar dicha información para que cada vez llegue a más personas y evitar así que continúe la cadena. Foto: TikTok: mkp.jennifer. Cómo evitar caer en la estafa del momento Como punto principal cabe aclarar que Farmacity no vende Nars, no vende Sol de Janeiro, Dior, Channel ni ninguna de las marcas que promete la caja. Farmacity únicamente trabaja con marcas de farmacia, como por ejemplo, L´Oreal, Maybelline, Garnier, o de su línea como Get the Look, Extreme, entre otras. Al momento, ya fueron muchos los estafados, en su mayoría mujeres. ""No llegué a pagar pero lo malo es que se quedaron con mis datos"", ""Caí, se quedaron con mi dinero"" Son estafas muy fáciles en las que uno puede caer por eso es importante viralizar de qué se trata para alertar. No sólo roban dinero a cada uno que utiliza su tarjeta sino que además, a través de la encuesta quitan datos personales, datos bancarios, clonan tarjetas, ingresan a las cuentas. En este caso además, Farmacity es víctima de una suplantación de identidad por parte de los ciberestafadores que simulan ser la empresa para estafarte. Embed - Nany -Blogg mi día a día, perfumes, belleza en Instagram: ""Farmacity Estafa! Ojo con estas cosas chicas! Están viralizando que hay una chica que dice la hecharon de Farmacity y que hay una encuesta oculta que si la completas podes tener una caja misteriosa x $1700/ $2000 ojo es mentira no caigan en estas cosas! #estafa #farmacity #CajaMisteriosa #nany_skincare"" La estafa con el link puede llegar por mail, no sólo a través de Facebook o Instagram, o redes sociales. En caso de posteos de Facebook, los estafadores convencían a las personas a través del siguiente relato, por ejemplo, simulando ser trabajadores de la empresa. Uno de los casos que se viralizó relataba: ""Mi hermana trabaja en Farmacity y después de días de grandes descuentos les quedaron un montón de maquillajes y productos de belleza sin vender, por acuerdos internos están obligados a armar esas ""misterys boxes"" que mandan a cambio de una reseña o encuesta. Si quieren recibir una ingresen al link de los comentarios. Yo ya la pedí y está buenísima, todo original"". Y luego, para hacerlo más creíble ese posteo se llenaba de comentarios de personas que supuestamente compraron y les llegó la caja con todos los productos. Pero Farmacity no es la única víctima, atentos, ya que también sucedió lo mismo con Amazon, Mercado Libre, Milka (prometiendo cajas de chocolates), entre otras marcas con estafadores que operaban del mismo modo.

Juliana caiu em um desfiladeiro na sexta-feira (20/6), enquanto fazia o percurso rumo ao cume do vulcão, e desde então equipes de resgate tentam localizá-la em meio a terreno acidentado, falésias e condições climáticas instáveis. Além do terreno desafiador, o clima imprevisível — com neblina, chuvas e ventos fortes — costuma surpreender até montanhistas experientes. Nos últimos cinco anos, pelo menos cinco mortes foram registradas na região, incluindo a de escaladores portugueses, malaios e indonésios. Em dezembro de 2021, um montanhista de 26 anos, natural de Surabaya, morreu após cair em um desfiladeiro de 100 metros de profundidade enquanto subia o monte Rinjani pela rota de Senaru, em North Lombok. Em agosto de 2022, um alpinista português, de 37 anos, morreu ao despencar de um penhasco no cume do monte Rinjani. Ele caiu enquanto tirava uma selfie na beira do abismo. O acidente ocorreu no dia 19 de agosto e o corpo foi retirado do local no dia 22. Em junho de 2024, uma turista suíça morreu após cair na trilha do Bukit Anak Dara, no distrito de Sembalun, East Lombok. A estrangeira havia se arriscado por uma rota ilegal. Em setembro de 2024, um escalador de Jacarta desapareceu após supostamente cair em um desfiladeiro na área do monte Rinjani, em 28 de setembro. O corpo foi localizado por um drone com câmera térmica, a centenas de metros de profundidade, e resgatado uma semana depois. Em outubro de 2024, um alpinista irlandês caiu em um desfiladeiro de 200 metros enquanto subia rumo ao cume do monte Rinjani, em 9 de outubro. Ele foi resgatado pela equipe de busca e salvamento (SAR) e sofreu apenas ferimentos leves. Em maio de 2025, um montanhista da Malásia, Rennie Bin Abdul Ghani, de 57 anos, morreu ao cair durante a descida do monte Rinjani pela rota de Torean. Ele despencou em um desfiladeiro com cerca de 80 a 100 metros de profundidade, na trilha de Banyu Urip, quando o grupo retornava do cume. Terreno hostil e clima imprevisível aumentam risco O monte Rinjani é conhecido pelas vistas deslumbrantes, mas também pelo terreno traiçoeiro. Com mais de 3.700 metros de altitude, é o segundo maior vulcão da Indonésia e famoso pelas trilhas íngremes, com trechos estreitos junto a penhascos e áreas de solo arenoso que aumentam o risco de quedas. Segundo a comunidade local de montanhistas, o Rinjani não é recomendado para iniciantes e é mais adequado a trilheiros experientes. As trilhas são estreitas e rochosas, com ravinas íngremes e trechos de areia solta que tornam a escalada particularmente escorregadia e perigosa. ""Os montanhistas costumam iniciar a subida por volta das 2h da manhã para tentar ver o nascer do sol do cume, geralmente usando lanternas simples que oferecem pouca visibilidade. Normalmente, são acompanhados por guias, mas a combinação de escuridão, terreno instável e clima imprevisível aumenta bastante o risco. Localizado em uma região remota e sem acesso a transporte motorizado, todo o trabalho de resgate depende de equipes que se deslocam a pé"", explica Astudestra Ajengrastri, indonésia e editora assistente do Asia Production Digital Hub da BBC.

A montanha ficou fechada entre janeiro e março deste ano, durante a estação chuvosa da Indonésia, e só foi reaberta após ser considerada segura."""

Terreno hostil e clima imprevisível aumentam risco O monte Rinjani é conhecido pelas vistas deslumbrantes, mas também pelo terreno traiçoeiro. Com mais de 3.700 metros de altitude, é o segundo maior vulcão da Indonésia e famoso pelas trilhas íngremes, com trechos estreitos junto a penhascos e áreas de solo arenoso que aumentam o risco de quedas. Segundo a comunidade local de montanhistas, o Rinjani não é recomendado para iniciantes e é mais adequado a trilheiros experientes. As trilhas são estreitas e rochosas, com ravinas íngremes e trechos de areia solta que tornam a escalada particularmente escorregadia e perigosa. ""Os montanhistas costumam iniciar a subida por volta das 2h da manhã para tentar ver o nascer do sol do cume, geralmente usando lanternas simples que oferecem pouca visibilidade. Normalmente, são acompanhados por guias, mas a combinação de escuridão, terreno instável e clima imprevisível aumenta bastante o risco.

mov_765F1F95B04865E1CDBE9079395F31F1,2025-06-24 14:21:01,en,WEB,"  Asos shoppers have expressed anger after their accounts were shut for returning too many orders. Some customers have received emails in recent days informing them they are banned for allegedly breaching the online fashion giant's fair use policy. It comes after the company last year began charging a controversial £3.95 fee if customers make frequent returns and keep less than £40 worth of items in an order. In a statement, Asos told the BBC: ""We recently closed the accounts of a small group of customers whose shopping activity has consistently fallen outside our fair use policy. ""This helps us maintain our commitment to offering free returns to all customers across all core markets."" Asos' fair use policy says that it may shut down accounts that have ""unusual or suspicious activity"", which it says includes ""unusual patterns of returns activity"" and items being returned that look worn. The retailer first warned customers in 2019 that it might deactivate accounts displaying such patterns, but customers say a tougher crackdown has begun in the last week. Lucy Britnell, a self-confessed ""shopaholic"" from Teesside, has paid for a premier Asos account since 2018, which gives customers free delivery - but has now been banned. ""I probably spend at least £100 a month with Asos - my latest holiday shop [over several orders] was £500,"" she says. ""Most of the time I have to order two sizes and then I'll return the one that doesn't fit - and Asos sizing, especially its own brands, is very unpredictable."" In an email on Thursday, Asos told Lucy: ""After reviewing your recent return activity, we've noticed that it no longer aligns with our current policy."" It said that it would close her account in 30 days and the ban would apply to any new accounts she opens. The same day, she received an Instagram request from Asos, asking permission to repost onto its account a photo of an Asos outfit she was wearing. ""It was a real slap in the face - I thought it was a joke at first,"" she said. ""Even if they did reinstate my account, I'd take my money elsewhere,"" Lucy says. ""It's really left a bad taste in my mouth."" Asos, which is based in the UK, says it shipped 67.2 million orders worldwide in the last financial year. As well as its own lines, it sells hundreds of other brands, and its website offers everything from low-priced clothing and vintage fashion to Korean skincare and Sol de Janeiro. Some customers have complained of being dismissed when trying to appeal their account bans. Louise Gowrie, 27, from Glasgow, says she was ""cut off"" when she tried to raise a complaint on the live chat feature of Asos' website. ""I tried again and asked how to complain regarding this and they told me the decision was final - and cut me off again with no reasoning,"" she told the BBC. Meanwhile Frankie Allen, 32, a PR director from London who has been an Asos customer for about 20 years, says she often orders clothes in two sizes and returns the one that doesn't fit. After being banned recently, she tried to explain this on the live chat but was told nothing could be done, screenshots seen by the BBC show. Such ""robotic comms"" have changed the way people view the company and ""alienated a lot of loyal customers,"" Frankie claimed. But she says she still understands why Asos is cracking down on returns. ""I've received ripped jeans and clothes with make-up on them before from Asos, so I know there are some people who abuse the policy - like they wear the clothes once, keep the labels on, then return them for a refund,"" she says. It's a view backed up by some industry insiders, who point out that shipping returned items back to warehouses, processing and inspecting them for damage all adds up. Inflation and freight issues have hit fashion companies hard too. ""Managing high volumes of returns simply isn't a sustainable model,"" retail expert Medi Parry-Williams says. ""In many cases, a return fee of £3.95 doesn't come close to covering these costs."" That said, closing customers' accounts is a ""fairly severe line to take"" and not one Asos would have taken lightly, says John Stevenson, retail analyst at Peel Hunt. Following a boom in returns since Covid lockdowns, some retailers introduced charges to return items by post or collection, including Next, Zara, H&M, Uniqlo and New Look, though they still offer free returns in store. Pretty Little Thing faced a backlash when it started deactivating accounts it said had high rates of return last year. The policy came in shortly after it introduced £1.99 fee for returns. Asos did not respond to further requests for comment from the BBC about customers being banned. Some are now calling on the company to change course. Broadcaster and consultant Tskenya-Sarah Frazer, 31, launched an online petition after she was banned from the site, calling for a halt on ""charging and punishing"" customers for online returns. ""As a plus-size, tall, and neurodivergent individual, shopping online is my only option,"" she tells the BBC. ""As the high street shrinks and we exist and have to shop more online, it is absolutely imperative that customers have the freedom to shop and return freely."""

El apoyo que este programa proporciona al periodismo es un ejemplo que otras compañías deberían seguir especialmente en estos tiempos de dificultades para los medios. El periodismo es y seguirá siendo un bien público indispensable en nuestras sociedades. Es un placer estar de vuelta en Buenos Aires o, como siempre digo a mis amigos, en Mi Buenos Aires Querido. Tuve la suerte de vivir aquí por cinco años en dos épocas, como corresponsal de un gran diario brasileño, en los años 70 y 80. Volver siempre trae recuerdos y me alegra mucho. Antes de la parte más interesante de nuestro encuentro, que será la conversa con Hernán y Gonzalo y con ustedes, voy a presentarles unas reflexiones iniciales sobre los profundos cambios que la era de la inteligencia artificial tendrá en el mundo en general y en el ecosistema mediático en particular. Cambio que ya empezaron y que seguramente muchos de ustedes ya están involucrados. La idea es tratar de entender, a través de una visión panorámica, cómo esos cambios van a afectar al mejor oficio del mundo, como cariñosamente Gabriel García Márquez se refería al periodismo. Antes de mirar hacia adelante, permítanme contarles que, como decimos allá en Texas: This is not my first rodeo. No, no es mi primer rodeo en esa tarea de tratar de llamar la atención de mis colegas sobre la inminencia de cambios radicales en el ambiente de los medios. Hace casi cuatro décadas tuve mi “aha moment”, mi momento Eureka, cuando estudiaba en la Universidad de Harvard en 1987. Participé en un seminario con uno de los fundadores del MIT Media Lab y sobre la revolución digital que más parecía ficción científica pero que vendría inexorablemente y cambiaría el mundo en las próximas décadas. Desde entonces, nunca dejé de pensar en eso. De regreso a Río de Janeiro, sentí que necesitaba hacer algo concreto. En 1991 lancé el primer servicio de distribución de noticias por computadoras en el país: el SIN, Sistema Instantâneo de Notícias de la Agência Jornal do Brasil. Ese servicio de periodismo en línea, pre-internet, pre-web, difundía noticias en tiempo real para unos 6 mil terminales de operadores bursátiles. Por primera vez, durante las operaciones de la Bolsa de Valores, esos operadores veían en las pantallas de sus terminales de una gran computadora mainframe las noticias que estarían en el periódico mañana. Era difícil escalar ese tipo restricto de servicio. Así que, cuando llegó la web, cerramos el SIN y sus reporteros y redactores pasaron a trabajar para el Jornal do Brasil Online en 1995, la primera edición en internet de un diario brasileño y uno de los primeros de América Latina. Al año siguiente, en 1996, me fui a Austin para ocupar la Cátedra Knight de Periodismo Internacional. Mi principal misión era la enseñanza e investigación académica sobre el trabajo de corresponsales extranjeros. Pero pronto me dediqué más a mi otra pasión: lancé el primer curso de periodismo online de nuestra universidad, uno de los primeros en Estados Unidos, y, durante las tres décadas siguientes, recorrí el mundo como una especie de “evangelizador digital”. Mi evangelio era el impacto que internet tendría en el periodismo. Mi misión era convencer a periodistas y ejecutivos de medios sobre la necesidad de adaptarse a la era digital. Yo decía dramáticamente que la muerte era la alternativa a no adaptarse: la muerte de los medios o de las carreras de periodistas reacios a los cambios que vendrían. Por eso tengo una sensación de déjà vu en estos tiempos en que empiezo a hablar de la necesidad urgente de que periodistas y medios piensen seriamente en cómo prepararse para la era de la inteligencia artificial. En las dos primeras décadas de mi peregrinaje de evangelizador digital, era común encontrar escepticismo y a veces hostilidad y cinismo entre periodistas, ejecutivos y dueños de medios. Los cambios radicales en el lucrativo ambiente de los medios parecían impensables. No podía ser —me decían—, llamándome exagerado y otras cositas menos agradables. Una vez un director de un periódico importante me dijo, medio en broma, que, cuando hablaba de internet, yo inventaba dificultades para vender facilidades como consultor de medios. Muy ofensivo, ¿no? Hace unos 15 años, me contrataron para hablar en un retiro corporativo de planeación estratégica de un conglomerado de medios en un lujoso resort en una playa. Yo era el orador principal, pero antes de mí habló el CEO de la compañía, que tenía excelentes noticias sobre extraordinarias ganancias del año anterior, incluyendo un generoso bono para todos los empleados. Yo me sentí un poco molesto por tener que hablar de disrupción, de vacas flacas, después del festival de vacas gordas que acabábamos de escuchar. Entonces tuve una idea. Empecé mi charla pidiendo a la gente que imaginara este escenario: estábamos todos en la playa vecina, en un lindo domingo de sol, y yo aparecía gritando que teníamos que salir de inmediato, refugiarnos en lugares altos, pues venía un tsunami enorme. Y los imaginaba contestándome así: “Rosental, ¿ya estás borracho a esta hora de la mañana? El cielo está azul, el día está lindo, todo el mundo está disfrutando, tomá otra caipirinha, relajá, aprovechá la playa”. Más o menos así los imaginaba pensando sobre lo que les iba a decir de la inminente disrupción de sus modelos de negocios y de los hábitos de consumo de sus audiencias. Aquí en Buenos Aires, creo que hace casi veinte años, periodistas de FOPEA me escucharon decir en su congreso que pronto íbamos a pasar “de la era de los medios de masa a una era de una masa de medios.” A FOPEA le gustó tanto la frase que la imprimió en una taza de café que guardo en mi oficina en la universidad con mucho cariño, mientras veo la enorme fragmentación de los medios, los miles y miles de influencers e otros fenómenos similares.. Pues aquí estamos otra vez para hablar de otro tsunami que se avecina. Obviamente, no me atrevo a decir cómo será el mundo en los próximos 30 años, pero sí tengo la audacia de predecir que la transformación del ecosistema mediático será aún más fuerte, la disrupción de la IA será aún más intensa que la de los últimos 30 años. El tsunami será mayor, y una vez más estará lleno de amenazas y oportunidades. No sé exactamente lo que va a pasar. Nosotros, los humanos, no somos buenos en profecías, porque casi siempre prevemos el futuro con base en el presente o en el pasado, lo que causa distorsiones fatales. Pero sí podemos hacer algunas comparaciones, tratar de identificar errores que cometimos en el último tsunami y aprender de ellos...."
daa1a4a52098acc0799af262c567326a,2025-06-24 18:48:00,pt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]“Araguaia”, do cineasta e escritor tocantinense Hermes Leal, estreia nacionalmente a partir de 26 de junho de 2025, no circuito de arte do país. Com distribuição da Jalapão Filmes e narração do ator Paulo Betti, o documentário reconstrói a desconhecida Guerrilha do Araguaia, com relatos de militares e ex-guerrilheiros, que saíram do anonimato para relatar torturas e mortes, em um dos maiores extermínios de pessoas na história do Brasil. O longa-metragem, construído a partir do seriado documental para TV “ Guerra do Araguaia”, denuncia e reconstitui o massacre de 69 pessoas que faziam parte da Guerrilha do Araguaia, ocorrida entre 1972 e 1974, na floresta amazônica no sul do Pará. Pela primeira vez, militares assumem seus crimes e descrevem em detalhes como mataram dezenas de pessoas a sangue frio. Neste conflito, houve a maior mobilização de tropas no Brasil desde a Guerra do Paraguai e a Segunda Guerra Mundial; as forças militares utilizaram cerca de sete mil homens para combater e eliminar os guerrilheiros. “Araguaia” revela a verdade dos fatos, de forma a jogar luz em um dos episódios mais obscuros da História do Brasil, ainda no anonimato. Por isso, relata, cronologicamente, os cinco anos de preparação e os dois anos de combates desta sangrenta guerra, com depoimentos de militares (coronéis e soldados); documentos secretos; relatos inéditos de guerrilheiros, que há mais de 40 anos vivem no anonimato; de camponeses, que foram torturados e mortos tanto quanto os guerrilheiros; e contextualizada por historiadores e jornalistas especializados no assunto. O filme aborda todo o período dos combates, mostrando fatos inéditos dos dois lados do conflito, dos militares e dos guerrilheiros, e como dezenas de militantes do PC do B, vindos do Rio de Janeiro, São Paulo, Ceará e Bahia, enfrentaram um Exército bem armado, que precisou de três grandes campanhas para derrotar, decapitar e exterminar guerrilheiros mal armados, mas adaptados à selva. Até hoje, os militares não informaram o destino dos corpos de 49 pessoas desaparecidas no conflito. Os depoimentos dos sobreviventes, oito guerrilheiros, que estão vivos porque foram presos no início do conflito, ou conseguiram escapar no calor dos combates, antes do massacre final, dão um teor real aos acontecimentos do dia a dia da guerrilha. Suas façanhas foram presenciadas por camponeses, que sofreram nas mãos dos militares tanto quanto os guerrilheiros, e até hoje mantêm suas cicatrizes e a presença dos amigos guerrilheiros em suas vidas. Filmado nas locações onde os eventos ocorreram, na região entre Marabá (sul do Pará) e Xambioá (norte do Tocantins), “ Araguaia” busca, em seu conjunto e seus desdobramentos, compreender o que foi este fato histórico do país. Foram necessários meses de investigação para localizar e convencer guerrilheiros e militares para quebrar seus silêncios e revelar tudo o que foi mantido em segredo até hoje. Até os dias atuais, nenhum militar havia assumido seus crimes publicamente, nem detalhado suas operações de guerra. Coronel Lício, por exemplo, um dos personagens do filme, pode ser considerado a pessoa que mais matou durante todo o regime militar. O longa revela também um dos maiores centros de tortura do país, senão o maior, por onde passaram mais pessoas torturadas, chamado Casa Azul, que até hoje se mantém de pé na periferia de Marabá como uma memória viva das atrocidades cometidas lá dentro. E encerra com um diagnóstico sobre a busca da verdade, a punição dos responsáveis pelas atrocidades – ainda há 49 corpos desaparecidos –, e a dor de quem perdeu seus amigos e parentes. A narrativa reconstrói, cronologicamente, os sete anos de conflito, revelando os antecedentes, os treinamentos, as campanhas militares, até iniciar os combates, onde os militares e seus guias descrevem com detalhes como mataram, por exemplo, a guerrilheira Sônia, com oitenta tiros. Este evento é relatado pelos militares que a executaram, sendo que um deles carrega até hoje uma cicatriz do tiro recebido no rosto por Sônia antes de morrer.

mov_C6E5951CC911AE2DBA605297D212427C,2025-06-25 08:54:15,en,WEB,"  Asos shoppers have expressed anger after their accounts were shut for returning too many orders. Some customers have received emails in recent days informing them they are banned for allegedly breaching the online fashion giant's fair use policy. It comes after the company last year began charging a if customers make frequent returns and keep less than £40 worth of items in an order. In a statement, Asos told the BBC: ""We recently closed the accounts of a small group of customers whose shopping activity has consistently fallen outside our fair use policy. ""This helps us maintain our commitment to offering free returns to all customers across all core markets."" Asos' fair use policy says that it may shut down accounts that have ""unusual or suspicious activity"", which it says includes ""unusual patterns of returns activity"" and items being returned that look worn. The retailer first warned customers in 2019 that it might displaying such patterns, but customers say a tougher crackdown has begun in the last week. Lucy Britnell, a self-confessed ""shopaholic"" from Teesside, has paid for a premier Asos account since 2018, which gives customers free delivery - but has now been banned. ""I probably spend at least £100 a month with Asos - my latest holiday shop [over several orders] was £500,"" she says. ""Most of the time I have to order two sizes and then I'll return the one that doesn't fit - and Asos sizing, especially its own brands, is very unpredictable."" In an email on Thursday, Asos told Lucy: ""After reviewing your recent return activity, we've noticed that it no longer aligns with our current policy."" It said that it would close her account in 30 days and the ban would apply to any new accounts she opens. The same day, she received an Instagram request from Asos, asking permission to repost onto its account a photo of an Asos outfit she was wearing. ""It was a real slap in the face - I thought it was a joke at first,"" she says. ""Even if they did reinstate my account, I'd take my money elsewhere,"" Lucy says. ""It's really left a bad taste in my mouth."" Asos, which is based in the UK, says it shipped 67.2 million orders worldwide in the last financial year. As well as its own lines, it sells hundreds of other brands, and its website offers everything from low-priced clothing and vintage fashion to Korean skincare and Sol de Janeiro. Some customers have complained of being dismissed when trying to appeal their account bans. Louise Gowrie, from Glasgow, says she was ""cut off"" when she tried to raise a complaint on the live chat feature of Asos' website. ""I tried again and asked how to complain regarding this and they told me the decision was final - and cut me off again with no reasoning,"" the 27-year-old tells the BBC. Meanwhile Frankie Allen, 32, a PR director from London who has been an Asos customer for about 20 years, says she often orders clothes in two sizes and returns the one that doesn't fit. After being banned recently, she tried to explain this on the live chat but was told nothing could be done, screenshots seen by the BBC show. Such ""robotic comms"" have changed the way people view the company and ""alienated a lot of loyal customers,"" Frankie claims. But she says she still understands why Asos is cracking down on returns. ""I've received ripped jeans and clothes with make-up on them before from Asos, so I know there are some people who abuse the policy - like they wear the clothes once, keep the labels on, then return them for a refund,"" she says. It's a view backed up by some industry insiders, who point out that shipping returned items back to warehouses, processing and inspecting them for damage all adds up. Inflation and freight issues have hit fashion companies hard too. ""Managing high volumes of returns simply isn't a sustainable model,"" retail expert Medi Parry-Williams says. ""In many cases, a return fee of £3.95 doesn't come close to covering these costs."" That said, closing customers' accounts is a ""fairly severe line to take"" and not one Asos would have taken lightly, says John Stevenson, retail analyst at Peel Hunt. Following a boom in returns since Covid lockdowns, some retailers introduced charges to return items by post or collection, including Next, Zara, H&M, Uniqlo and New Look, though they still offer free returns in store. Pretty Little Thing faced a backlash when it started last year. The policy came in shortly after it introduced £1.99 fee for returns. Asos did not respond to further requests for comment from the BBC about customers being banned. Some are now calling on the company to change course. Broadcaster and consultant Tskenya-Sarah Frazer has launched an online petition after she was banned from the site, calling for a halt on ""charging and punishing"" customers for online returns. ""As a plus-size, tall, and neurodivergent individual, shopping online is my only option,"" the 31-year-old tells the BBC. ""As the high street shrinks and we exist and have to shop more online, it is absolutely imperative that customers have the freedom to shop and return freely."" More on this story"

THE Sol de Janeiro Cheirosa 39 Hair & Body Perfume Mist you can snag now that it's back for a spell (which is great news for the reviewers who've been hoarding previously bought bottles). The mouthwatering coconut cream and tropical orchid scent might just inspire you to queue up a YouTube playlist of Carmen Miranda bops, the legendary Brazilian performer who inspired the scent! Promising review: ""This is the best scent they have ever released! I purchased like 11 more bottles. I hoarded the other two that I had already had and only used them on special occasions. Now I can use it whenever!"" —TAMMY Get it from Ulta for $25. 2. Or a Bath & Body Works Off the Vine fragrance if the best line anyone can use on you is ""You smell so good!"" Here's to having a Tomato Girl Summer, even if you're plucking cans of San Marzano tomatoes off the grocery store shelf. I received this upon its release and have (seriously) considered buying 4–5 more bottles because I'm afraid B&BW will discontinue it. It's SO delectable but as someone who likes some gourmand scents, but not all, I wouldn't quite lump it in with those. (Its fragrance notes are heirloom tomato, garden geranium and Mediterranean moss.) I've gotten super into layering fragrances lately but I don't even do that with this because it smells interesting and is impactful enough! Get it from Bath & Body Works for $69.95. 3. Ice pop sleeves in different prints so everyone knows whose is whose while enjoying a frozen dessert at their own pace, instead of in a race against sticky, melting syrupy fun!

After all, if you're out and about enjoying the nice weather all day, you may not be drinking as much liquid as you should (or drinking too many beers instead of water). And! This one tastes like Firecracker Popsicles! Now THAT feels like summer. FYI, depending on your situation, water may be enough to rehydrate you! Read more about electrolyte-enhanced drinks and hydration at Cleveland Clinic. Promising review: ""Liquid IV does an amazing job hydrating. I purchase their product for 40+ employees who work in a construction-related industry. Hydration is so important while working in the hot Georgia Sun, and this product aids in this 100%. Now, let's talk about the firecracker flavor! When we produced these for our crew, ages 23–60, all of their eyes lit up, and they were super excited. Many of them did not know this flavor existed. Quite honestly, I didn't either until I came across them on Amazon. They all loved the flavor. In particular, the ones who were older kept telling me it tasted like their childhood. Seriously, who hasn't stood outside an ice cream truck ordering the Firecracker Popsicle?"" —Disney Diva Get a 16-pack from Amazon for $24.99. 5. A Western-inspired patio rug that's waterproof, reversible, and made from recycled plastic so you'll have a barefoot-friendly surface on your worse-for-wear deck. But if (ahem, WHEN) someone spills some wine on it, you can just hose it off! Promising review: ""This is the third one of these rugs I have bought over the last 10 years. Not because they wear out, but because I am adding to the stock...."

mov_2E2E68DDEA252D486E7BA8E76D6414E7,2025-06-25 15:05:16,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Si el riesgo de tormentas ha provocado la interrupción de algunos partidos durante el Mundial de Clubes, otro fenómeno meteorológico se ha convertido en protagonista de este torneo que se disputar por primera vez en en Estados Unidos: el calor sofocante. Pese a estar a comienzos del verano (boreal), el este de Estados Unidos se enfrenta ya a una ola de calor. Desde que el torneo, con su nuevo formato ampliado, comenzó hace dos semanas, se han registrado temperaturas más allá de los 35ºC en muchas de las ciudades que albergan partidos. Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Incluso por las noches, el termómetro raramente baja de los 30ºC en ciudades como Miami u Orlando, a lo que hay que añadir una alta humedad. En Charlotte, el mercurio subió incluso a los 40ºC el martes por la tarde durante el partido que enfrentó al Benfica de Portugal con el Bayern de Múnich (1-0). - Picos de hasta 42ºC - A la media hora, el jugador argentino del Benfica Gianluca Prestianni tuvo que permanecer varios minutos tumbado en el suelo, exhausto, aturdido. Tras refrescarse con una bolsa de hielo, el jugador pudo continuar aunque fue sustituido en la segunda parte. Al no poder descartar que algún jugador pueda sufrir un colapso, varios clubes han tomado medidas para limitar daños. Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Borussia Dortmund y Bayern de Múnich, por ejemplo, tomaron la decisión de que los jugadores del banquillo vieran la primera parte de sus partidos contra Benfica y el Mamelodi Sundowns sudafricano dentro del vestuario para protegerles del sol plomizo en Charlotte y Cincinnati, tal como informaron en sus redes sociales. Enzo Maresca, el entrenador italiano del Chelsea de Inglaterra, acortó el entrenamiento de su equipo el lunes en Filadelfia, donde el ayuntamiento había declarado la situación de urgencia sanitaria en la ciudad ante unas previsiones de temperaturas de hasta 42 grados... que al final ""solo"" fueron 38ºC. Más en Deportes - Anticipo ardiente de 2026 - Desde el inicio del torneo, la FIFA ha impuesto unas pausas de hidratación a la media hora de cada periodo, lo que permite a los jugadores y árbitros refrescarse y recuperar el aliento. Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Interrogada por la AFP, la FIFA aseguró que la salud de los futbolistas es una ""prioridad"" y recordó que los equipos ""pueden realizar un cambio adicional"" a los cinco permitidos en caso de prórroga. Además, que todos los clubes ""disponen de un mínimo de tres días entre dos partidos para facilitar la recuperación"" de los jugadores. Como otros equipos, el Dortmund impone medidas adicionales para luchar contra la humedad y el calor asfixiante. ""Nuestro personal médico cuida de los muchachos. Tenemos toallas muy frías. que metemos en cubos con hielo. Los jugadores también necesitan refrescar las piernas y los pies en agua fría y con baños de hielo"", explicó el entrenador Niko Kovac. Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Para el técnico, el calor tendrá incluso un impacto directo en el resultado del torneo: ""Creo que no lo ganará el mejor equipo, sino el que mejor se adapte a estas condiciones"". Los europeos no son los únicos en sufrir las altas temperaturas. Más habituado al calor como técnico del Fluminense de Rio de Janeiro, Renato Portaluppi advirtió que el bochorno es un ""punto crucial"" del renovado torneo de la FIFA. ""El calor aquí es casi insoportable. El equipo que tenga más posesión del balón puede estar seguro de que se desgastará menos"", dijo antes de enfrentar este miércoles al Mamelodi Sundowns en Miami. La experiencia vivida por los actores del torneo parece ser un anticipo de lo que espera a las 48 selecciones que dentro de un año disputen la Copa del Mundo, coorganizada por Estados Unidos, México y Canadá. Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad - Episodios más frecuentes e intensos - Un reciente estudio publicado por el International Journal of Biometeorology advirtió a jugadores y espectadores contra los riesgos de exponerse a temperaturas extremas, que son cada vez ""más frecuentes y más intensas"" debido al cambio climático.

mov_E3759979EF95C2CD0DDA08F0A3047F08,2025-06-25 16:25:07,pt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]Após quatro dias à espera de resgate, Juliana Marins foi encontrada morta nesta terça-feira, 24 de junho. A jovem brasileira, de 26 anos, perdeu a vida após cair num penhasco a cerca de 650 metros de altura, no Monte Rinjani, na ilha de Lombok, na Indonésia, e ficar presa numa encosta de difícil acesso e com um vasto histórico de acidentes.  A notícia foi avançada pela família da turista. “A equipa de resgate conseguiu chegar até ao local”, escreveram. “Com imensa tristeza, informamos que ela não resistiu. Seguimos muito gratos por todas as orações, mensagens de carinho e apoio que temos recebido.” Juliana, que viajava pela região desde fevereiro, e que já tinha passado pelas Filipinas, Tailândia e Vietname, preparava-se agora para chegar ao cume daquele que é o segundo vulcão mais alto da Indonésia, com cerca de 3.700 metros de altitude. O percurso estava previsto durar entre 20 e 22 de junho, com três dias e duas noites. O incidente voltou a expor os riscos de um dos destinos mais desafiadores — mas também mais procurados — do sudeste asiático. Com uma duração entre dois a quatro dias, o roteiro implica a passagem por zonas de declive acentuado e com um clima imprevisível, nomeadamente em épocas de chuva e neblina. Segundo dados oficiais do governo indonésio, entre 2019 e 2024, foram registados 180 acidentes e 8 mortes nas trilhas da Parque Nacional de Rinjani. Uma das vítimas mortais era portuguesa, um alpinista de 37 anos que morreu em agosto de 2022. As causas mais comuns apontam para quedas ou torções. Juliana é a vítima mais recente. O mesmo relatório, partilhado em março, mostra que, do total de acidentes, 44 envolvem turistas estrangeiros e 136 apontam para locais. O número, porém, tem vindo a crescer. Enquanto em 2021 se contavam 21 casos, só nos primeiros meses de 2024 já se somavam seis dezenas. O percurso imprevisível “Os montanhistas costumam iniciar a subida por volta das 2 horas da manhã para tentar ver o nascer do sol do cume, geralmente usando lanternas simples que oferecem pouca visibilidade”, começa por explicar a  editora assistente do Asia Production Digital Hub da BBC, Astudestra Ajengrastri. Conhecido pelas vistas deslumbrantes, o monte conta também com um terreno traiçoeiro. Destaca-se pelos troços estreitos e rochosos, com desfiladeiros íngremes e um solo arenoso que torna a escalada mais escorregadia e perigosa.  “Normalmente, são acompanhados por guias, mas a combinação de escuridão, terreno instável e clima imprevisível aumenta bastante o risco”, acrescenta. “Localizado numa região remota e sem acesso a transporte motorizado, todo o trabalho de resgate depende de equipes que se deslocam a pé.” Além disso, Ajengrastri destaca que, por vezes, os ventos transformam-se rapidamente numa tempestade. A altura ideal para visitar é, por isso, a época seca, entre abril e novembro.  “Uma neblina densa frequentemente cobre a montanha, ocultando penhascos e reduzindo drasticamente a visibilidade — o que impõe desafios adicionais tanto aos escaladores quanto às equipes de resgate.” Entre janeiro e março deste ano, a montanha ficou precisamente encerrada durante a estação chuvosa da Indonésia. Só foi reaberta durante o segundo trimestre de 2025 após ter sido considerada segura. Se, por um lado, há fatores difíceis de controlar, como a passagem por zonas de elevada inclinação ou estas condições meteorológicas adversas, há muitos acidentes por negligência dos próprios turistas. Fala-se em falta de preparação física, uso de equipamentos pouco adequados ou fora dos circuitos autorizados. Como resposta, as autoridades indonésias comprometeram-se a reforçar as medidas de segurança. Instalaram placas de alerta em algumas das zonas mais perigosas. Os visitantes também recebem orientações de segurança na entrada do trilho, embora muita gente não as siga. "

mov_63FA50A9B0ECFCC92FBEAD3B32532768,2025-06-25 18:38:59,pt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]O lançamento de “Quando uma mulher descobre o mundo”, livro de Michelli Lopes, mato-grossense que desde os 3 anos de idade é cega, promete ser um evento carregado de emoção. Na quinta-feira, dia 26 de junho, 18h, na Casa Barão, sede da Academia Mato-Grossense de Letras, os convidados estarão diante de uma jornada de resistência e superação. Na obra “Quando uma mulher descobre o mundo”, a escritora Michelli Lopes, uma mulher negra, cega, pobre, mato-grossense, da cidade de Cáceres, que foi alfabetizada pela oralidade, narra suas experiências pessoais e dá o tom maior para sua poesia. Fala, dentre outras vivências, sobre o abandono paterno e da luta de sua mãe Nilza Lopes uma guerreira que criou sozinha 3 filhos, relata seu caminhar para a alfabetização, com poucas incursões, não bem sucedidas, pelo Braile, ainda quando nem mesmo os professores dominavam a técnica. O livro que tem a chancela da Mágico de Oz Editora, de Portugal/Brasil será lançada no dia 26 de junho, 19h30 na Casa Barão, sede da Academia Mato-Grossense de Letras. Leia também - Seciteci oferece curso gratuito de informática básica A autora, traz através de relatos fortes, ora pela poesia que nem sempre abranda um cotidiano carregado de superações, preconceitos e exclusões; ora pelo percurso que percorreu para ser ouvida e lida, que foi longo, pois foram muitos anos de isolamento social, desde que ficou cega, aos 3 anos de idade. Ela acredita, entretanto, que pode ir mais além, tendo um sonho ainda maior, o de cursar a Faculdade de Serviço Social. O livro, não só por uma evidência da influência de sua escrita, dentro da chamada literatura decolonial, deu voz para Michelli, que viveu sua vida até 28 anos, fora suas passagens pela Associação de Pais e Amigos de Excepcionais-APAE, de Cáceres, em solidão, enclausurada em casa, entre quatro paredes, sem muitas perspectivas de uma vida fora do ambiente familiar, temendo sempre ser marginalizada, subalternizada e distante da chamada justiça social. Divulgação   Na parte 3 da obra, a lira de Michelli grita. No texto intitulado “Divisor de águas, desaguar? A autora diz que houve um dia, em que ela parou de chorar. Depois um dia que parou de concordar! E, então, foi quando percebeu que assustou as pessoas por manifestar as suas vontades, inclusive de vestir-se com roupas de baixo, e além desta dignidade, queria mais, a exemplo de estudar, ouvir música e escrever. Jornalistas sensíveis A apresentação e o prefácio da obra de Michelli Lopes foram escritos, respectivamente, com a sensibilidade das jornalistas e escritoras, Sueli Batista e Mirella Duarte. Sueli que também empreendedora social, produtora cultural e empresária, viabilizou a obra e a noite de lançamento, através de suas redes de relacionamentos. Ela deixou registrado que a inspiração de Michelli Lopes trafegou pela via da oralidade e foi convertida em texto, com precisão, por uma professora da APAE, de Cáceres. “Isso mostra a importância dos educadores na construção da cidadania”. Numa forma de homenagem para a professora Maria José, uma das páginas do caderno com a poesia “a força do querer” que foi datada em 4 de abril de 2017, quando ela assinava Michelli Roberta, foi reproduzida no final da obra. A homenagem para Maria José, que elaborou uma primeira versão do livro, que foi escrita a tinta, em um caderno, no qual Michelli ditava e a professora escrevia mostra o quanto devemos sempre lembrar daqueles que ajudam no percurso. O caderno foi encapado e entregue para a autora, que agora está debutando como escritora, em “Quando uma mulher descobre o mundo”. Sueli diz que Michelli é a personificação da resiliência. Quando afirma que “quando se tem muita vontade de transformar os sonhos em realidade, realizamos”, ela nos lembra que a luz mais poderosa não é aquela que vemos, mas a que carregamos dentro de nós. Essa ideia, destaca a jornalista, se traduz lindamente em seus versos: “navego no escuro, mas meu coração é farol, as palavras são as velas que me guiarão ao sol.” Para Sueli, que sempre foi muito sensível às causas sociais, inclusive em conexão com a arte, a poesia a nova autora, é um testemunho de que, mesmo nas noites mais sombrias, há sempre um caminho iluminado pela determinação. Falando num tom da Psicologia Positiva, Sueli revelou que a obra de Michelli nos convida para a descoberta de nós mesmos e que seus escritos ressoaram profundamente nela, e ela espera que também faça sentido para os leitores. Isso porque, diz ela, que no livro é mostrado que a verdadeira visão não está nos olhos, mas em um olhar interno guiado pela coragem e pela esperança. Descobertas e inspirações A escrita de Michelli é fruto de seus vários momentos de descobertas e inspirações, seja dentro de suas vivências, pelo que lia e ouvia através da música. Ela cita, dentre suas referências, duas negras que saíram do caminho comum, a escritora mineira, Conceição Evaristo e Elza Soares, sendo que a cantora inspirou até mesmo o título do seu livro, com a composição “A mulher do fim do mundo”, de Romulo Froes e Alice Coutinho, que Elza interpretou tocando a autora pelas vias do seu coração. A composição depois que ouviu pela primeira vez, ela guardou a referência, e diz que após seis meses, veio a sua mente para dar nome edição: “Quando uma mulher descobre o mundo”. Mirella Duarte, vencedora do Prêmio Literário ExpoFavela 2023, no prefácio do livro, o considerou como “uma obra prima que desnuda dores e amores, nem sempre reveladas tão honestamente pela humanidade, de forma fácil e breve”. Ela disse que cada poema de Michelli é como arrancar um curativo recém-feito, deixando as feridas arderem sem medo e expondo-o ao tempo. Para ela a coleção de poemas mostra a dor da solidão de uma escritora descobre máscaras com direito a frustrações, mágoas, reencontros e descobertas. Mirella foi além, comparando o livro como um portal de autoconhecimento para um mundo. Classificou a obra com indicativo para pessoas maduras e dispostas a observar as fragilidades com o ponto de partida e para recomeços. O percurso da realização Pode se dizer que a concretização do livro de Michelli, seja fruto da sensibilidade de quem empreende socialmente. O projeto chegou às mãos de Sueli Batista através da professora Ayo Adeola, que a jornalista conheceu, quando presidiu a Academia Mato-Grossense de Letras. A educadora lembra como foi a história. Ela estava em desespero, porque haviam lhe prometido publicar o livro, e ela encheu Micheli de esperanças e isso não se realizou. Ao relatar o fato, nem ousou pedir patrocínio, mas sim justificar porque havia a convidado para apresentação da obra. Porém, com uma grande sensibilidade, ela disse que iria publicar o livro, em 2025, buscando alternativas em janeiro. E assim o fez. Primeiro reuniu-se online, de Cuiabá, para além mar, com Izadora Valadares, CEO da Mágico de Oz Editora, em Portugal, empresa com quem Sueli já tem relacionamento por outros trabalhos. Ouvindo o sim, e boas condições para tornar o sonho uma realidade, tocou o projeto adiante. Na mesma semana Sueli conseguiu sensibilizar dois dirigentes de cooperativas de crédito, a presidente da Sicoob União MS/MT, Aifa Naomi e o gerente da Sicredi Outro Verde, da Carmino de Campos, de Cuiabá para a impressão da obra...."

I'm heading for 60, and I inherited my family's crepey skin. Nothing has really worked after the first hour, but this was amazing! My skin looked more for my age instead of an 80-year-old's. It isn't dry and flaky anymore. Got one for my 86-year-old mother, whose calves looked like molted snake skin. No more flakes! Day after day! I use it on damp skin after my shower."" —Veronica Get it from Amazon for $24 (available in three sizes and as a two-pack). 2.

Promising review: ""At 60 years old, I have some darkness, lines, and wrinkles around my eyes, and small bags just above my cheekbones. This product works miracles for me. I just have to make sure I don't get it below my cheekbones because you can't put makeup where the product is. Any moisture contact will make the product stop working. Also, there is a pulling sensation when first applied, but I get used to it after a few minutes. A little bit of the gel goes a long way. If you apply too much, you'll get a white flaey look. It takes a little practice to get it right. The product works a good 8 hours for me unless I'm sweating or get wet."" —westielove Get it from Amazon for $38. 4.

18033169034668606,2025-06-28 00:00:06,es,INSTAGRAM,"  ✝️Boadilla del Monte es el lugar donde la Asociación Católica Sagrado Corazón, constituida por vecinos y fieles de la localidad, se ha propuesto construir la que está llamada a ser la estatua del Sagrado Corazón de Jesús más grande del mundo. Una figura de 37 metros de altura y casi 60 de envergadura, superando incluso al famoso Cristo Redentor de Río de Janeiro por solo 1metro de altura. Tanto es así, que el proyecto contempla que la estatua pueda visitarse por dentro y aspira a que se convierta en un nuevo centro espiritual de relevancia internacional. (Adjuntamos infografías y video promocional). ❤️Su corazón, de 2,5 metros, latirá, brillará y descenderá cada mañana para ser tocado por los visitantes. (En ese corazón, se grabarán los nombres, de los que pongan su dinero voluntariamente, para su construcción). EI diseño, basado en la Sábana Santa de Turín, deja ver las heridas de la Pasión como aberturas por donde entrará la luz del sol durante el día...y saldrá como una constelación luminosa por la noche. 💰Para hacer realidad esta iniciativa, que se encuentra aún en su fase inicial, la asociación ha lanzado una campaña de crowdfunding que permita financiar su construcción.

However, I got it in a ""no coins required"" shipping day, so I didn't have to spend the 500 coins just to get the damn box shipped. Worth it to me, but that also depends on how much time you spend on PINCHme and how often you pursue their offers to get more coins. That's the only time I've won bidding on anything, which I don't do very often. But I do check the app daily and apply for everything so I can obtain my measley 2 coins and save them."

mov_2E8AE71BC51DE4D88EFD178F66CC6F89,2025-06-29 19:49:08,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]MIAMI (Enviado especial).- El cruce quedó definido hace apenas unos días, pero la pregunta se instaló mucho antes: ¿a quién hubieran preferido enfrentar los hinchas de Flamengo en los octavos de final del Mundial de Clubes? ¿Al poderoso Bayern Munich o al siempre incómodo Boca? El formato del torneo y el orden de los grupos dejaron ese escenario abierto hasta la última fecha. Flamengo, primero del Grupo D, debía cruzarse con el segundo del C. Y en ese grupo estaba Boca, que llegó con chances de clasificarse, pero empató con Auckland City cuando necesitaba golear. De todos modos, aun con una victoria amplia, el Xeneize habría quedado al margen, porque en el otro partido Benfica venció al Bayern y se adueñó del segundo puesto. Si el cierre del grupo hubiera sido distinto, otra habría sido la historia. Flamengo pisó fuerte en fase de grupos y va por los cuartos de final ante el Bayern - Créditos: @DAN MULLAN La disyuntiva entre Bayern y Boca parece, a simple vista, despareja. El equipo teutón es uno de los grandes candidatos al título, con una historia marcada por sus seis Champions League y su dominio en la liga alemana. Flamengo, sin embargo, tiene presente y pasado de sobra como para plantarse con cualquiera. Y en el medio, aparecía la opción de Boca: no tan fuerte en lo económico ni en lo institucional, pero con una mística copera que no tiene comparación en Sudamérica. Y que, incluso en Brasil, genera respeto. Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad El historial entre Flamengo y Boca no es tan extenso, pero sí concluyente: se enfrentaron cuatro veces en torneos oficiales, y el Xeneize ganó tres. Dos por la Libertadores 1991 -en los cuartos de final- y otras dos por la Mercosur 1998, en la primera fase del torneo. Ese antecedente explica por qué muchos hinchas del Mengao preferían evitar al equipo de Miguel Russo. Porque más allá de los nombres, hay algo que se repite cada vez que Boca afronta un partido mano a mano: da la sensación de que siempre tiene una vida más. Aun así, el marco que Boca genera en las tribunas también despierta admiración entre los hinchas del Mengao, que reconocen el magnetismo de ver al Xeneize en ese tipo de escenarios. “Hubiera preferido a Boca. Es un gran equipo y, aunque hoy no tiene grandes figuras, por su tradición y su camiseta, habría sido una verdadera fiesta sudamericana“, comenta un fanático de Flamengo con una bandera doblada en la mano, mientras espera su turno para comprar en uno de los puestos de comida rápida afuera del estadio. El partido de este domingo será en el Hard Rock Stadium, la casa de los Miami Dolphins, con capacidad para más de 65 mil personas. Si bien hay seguidores del Bayern repartidos por el mundo, los que llegaron hasta aquí son pocos en comparación con la marea roja y negra que copó las calles y las tribunas. Buena parte del público “alemán” está compuesto por latinos que siguen al club por sus hazañas en la Champions, por el paso de figuras como James Rodríguez o por el peso histórico del escudo. “Con Boca somos hinchadas hermanas. A mi me hubiese gustado jugar contra ellos, porque son parecidos a nosotros”, dice otro torcedor carioca, que llegó directo desde Río de Janeiro. Hay un patrón que se repite: para los brasileños, Bayern Munich representa un desafío más exigente dentro de la cancha, pero varios preferían enfrentar a Boca por el clima que se habría vivido en las tribunas, más allá de que ese fervor podía inclinar la balanza a favor del equipo argentino. Boca no pudo avanzar a octavos, y se perdió el cruce contra Flamengo - Créditos: @FEDERICO PARRA De todos modos, no faltarán hinchas de Boca en las tribunas. Son los más entusiastas, que compraron sus entradas con anticipación y decidieron quedarse en Miami incluso después de la eliminación del equipo. Los que confiaban ciegamente en la clasificación y, aunque se llevaron una desilusión, les resultó más barato quedarse que pagar la multa para cambiar los pasajes. Además, el clima ayuda: playa, sol y fútbol hacen que la espera valga la pena. Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad “Hubiera elegido a Boca, porque es más emocionante un juego entre brasileños y argentinos”, graficó un tercer hincha en la previa. A su lado, otro agrega con una sonrisa: “Les hubiésemos ganado a los dos”. El vencedor de Bayern Munich-Flamengo irá contra PSG, que goleó 4 a 0 a Inter Miami y se metió entre los ocho mejores del certamen. Bayern se clasificó segundo en el Grupo C, pero sigue siendo un rival de temer - Créditos: @PATRICIA DE MELO MOREIRA “Boca es un buen rival, pero Bayern es más difícil. Y, como todo hincha, deseo que mi equipo gane”, admite un hincha con acento bahiano, que viajó por primera vez a Estados Unidos para seguir al conjunto de Filipie Luís. Será Bayern, entonces, el rival de Flamengo en octavos. Pero el fantasma de Boca todavía ronda la previa. Porque la historia pesa, y para los brasileños, enfrentar a un argentino tiene siempre un condimento especial."

mov_0E21D36180CC6481DE6CFD5E10E76521,2025-06-30 12:30:21,en,WEB,"  “Will the girl who I just met at the perfume store please comment the perfume you recommended,” wrote Chappell Roan on Instagram last month. “You said it smelled like lipstick.” The post went viral and the scent – Girl of the Year by the Los Angeles perfume house Thin Wild Mercury – instantly sold out. It's hard to think of a more appropriate perfume for the performer. The house describes it as having “top notes of lipstick and incense; middle notes of 'smoker's leather jacket' and a base of sandalwood, orris root and vintage fur”. The brand – whose name is culled from a Bob Dylan quote – is one of a growing set of perfumers reinventing scent for new fragrance fans. Like bedroom DJs or T-shirt screen-printers before them, they're changing the culture of an established industry. The global fragrance market is the biggest it has ever been and still growing; it is set to generate revenue of about £45bn in 2025, according to Statista. The UK market alone reached £1.74bn in 2024 and, if growth continues apace, will top £2bn by 2029 according to a 2024 Mintel report. This growth is driven by gen Z and millennials, who have formed a unique relationship with fragrance due to social media and Covid isolation – PerfumeTok drove 45% of social media scent sales in the US by 2023. Instead of a dab behind the ear, they prefer scent layering – wearing two or more perfumes at the same time – and scent wardrobing (matching fragrances to different occasions). Eighty-three per cent of gen Z wear fragrance as often as three times a week, according to a recent report by Circana. Perfume took off, somewhat unexpectedly, during lockdown, says Suzy Nightingale of the podcast On the Scent. “It was expected the fragrance market would fall, but it boomed,” says Nightingale, an award-winning perfume blogger. “People discovered they could punctuate their day with moments of difference – travel with their noses, revel in nostalgia or excite their senses with novelty. I think that was when people realised it's not about 'attracting a partner' or having a signature scent – if it ever was. It's donning an invisible cloak of protection, empowering yourself.” Successful perfume influencers play a key role in the storytelling side of these products. Theatrical and charismatic TikTokkers such as @professorperfume and @jeremyfragrance explain new scents so vividly that their followers sometimes buy without smelling the perfume first. They spin tales of the weird girls and confident boys who wear these scents; PerfumeTok influences 66% of gen Z purchases. Teenage boys have become surprising cognoscenti when it comes to luxury aftershave. The TikTok term for scent layering in this age group is “smellmaxxing”, a buzzword that became so prevalent that the New York Times defined it last year as a “term for enhancing one's musk”. According to a 2025 US trend report by Piper Sandler, teenagers are spending more money across beauty categories in general, but fragrance has grown the most – up 22% year on year. On a recent visit to Bloom Perfumery, a boutique selling independent and niche fragrances in the UK, I watched a boy who couldn't have been older than 16 chat about cologne with an assistant twice his age with a genuinely inspiring level of passion and sophistication, beaming through his braces as he discussed smoky notes. “There's been a lot of pearl-clutching commentary worrying about how much [teenagers] spend,” says Nightingale. “But if you actually bother to talk to the younger generations thronging the halls of perfumeries from Boots to the Black Hall of Harrods, you discover they're saving their pocket money – sometimes for years – and taking on part-time jobs to explore scent.” While previous generations were satisfied with scent juggernauts such as CK One, Le Male, Poison or Opium, an emerging group of “frag heads” wants more. The idea of personalising your scent – smellmaxxing or scent layering – is key for them. Still, what 16-year-old can afford to layer a £90 Loewe scent with something marginally cheaper from Armani – and to that end, how did such expensive scents become the norm? As luxury scents boomed post-pandemic, so too did dupes – replicas of designer products. Offering luxury style at low prices, dupes feel more Robin Hood than guilty secret. Some new brands got their start providing vegan or cruelty-free alternatives to blockbuster fragrances, notably Eden Perfumes, a family-run business in Brighton now lauded for its own scents as much as its knockoffs. Meanwhile, the high street stepped up to do what it does best: producing designer style at affordable prices. The Zara perfume counter is currently the place to go if you want to smell like a million dollars for less than £20. While logos and bottle designs are easy to trademark, you cannot trademark a scent nor patent a perfume recipe under UK law. Some dupes can be poorer quality than luxury brands, but they're safe as long as you use common sense. A trusted retailer will follow safety standards; an unknown one may not be as stringent. As well as dupes, “niche perfumes” gained traction. While cosmetics giants such as Coty, Guerlain and Estée Lauder have dominated since the early 20th century, independent pioneers appeared who followed their instincts and taste rather than market research. Brands such as Le Labo, Sol de Janeiro and Byredo changed the game – Le Labo's Santal 33 was the fashion circle's signature scent and a Santal 26 candle appeared in Beyoncé's Lemonade film in 2016. Victoria Beckham and Sienna Miller namechecked Byredo as their favourite perfumer. It is no wonder these brands have now been snapped up by LVMH and other conglomerates. More indie scents launched after lockdown, including complicated and counterintuitive fragrances. The idea of perfume as confrontational, confusing art grew. The Canadian brand Zoologist found fame for its award-winning Bee scent (notes of ginger syrup, royal jelly and broom) in 2020, as did Inexcusable Evil by the Romanian perfumer Toskovat, with its bouquet of bandages, blood and burnt flowers. This year brings Silver Haze from Alloy Studio, which evokes “a backseat smoke session” and has notes of cannabis, chocolate powder and strawberries. Food-inspired fragrances are the latest perfume craze with scents like pretzels and cherries finding favour. Some fans went deep, obsessing over process, rarity or a unique note in a scent, discussing them like oenophiles on Reddit and dedicated scent chatrooms. Some turned to DIY, using Sam Macer's YouTube channel and forums such as Basenotes to swap tips on sourcing ingredients and aroma combinations. For a few, the hobby became a side hustle and finally a career...."

It'll also wake up and temporarily tighten your skin with the same stuff you use to become awake and alert for the day...caffeine! That's right, our skin enjoys the stuff as much as the rest of us. This smells like vanilla and caramel, which means it's basically a latte for your skin. Delicious. You can read more about the skincare benefits of caffeine at the Cleveland Clinic. Promising review: ""This stuff is magic. I've tried a lot of products, and this one works the best out of everything I've tried. I love the scent. Sol de Jeneiro makes a body spray of it, and I get lots of compliments every time I wear it."" —Stephanie Hooper Get it from Amazon for $24+ (available in two sizes). 3. Gold Bond's firming neck and chest cream — whether you've noticed your neck skin practically hanging on for dear life thanks to that darn gravitational pull or find your décolletage creased in the center from side sleeping, the glycerin and aloe in this formula can give that delicate skin some much-needed hydration, while the salicylic acid can gently exfoliate dead skin cells. Reviewers say patience is worth it with this one, so give your body time to soak it all in and enjoy those results! Promising review: ""My dry neck and the annoying itchiness I used to experience have completely gone away after using this cream. It's not only soothing, but it also feels like it's really nourishing my skin. The firming benefits are a bonus! I highly recommend this product to anyone dealing with dryness or discomfort in their neck and chest area. It's become a must-have in my skincare routine."" —JAcosta Get it from Amazon for $11.19 (also available in a two-pack). 4. Cerave eye repair cream, which is cooked up with their famous blend of ceramides (a skincare ""secret sauce"" if you will) and a healthy dose of hyaluronic acid to boost hydration and niacinamide to help tighten and brighten the appearance of skin. If you're revitalizing your skincare routine, add this to the mix and reduce the appearance of dark circles, under-eye puffiness, *and* fine lines. ~Eye~ love to see it. Promising review: ""What sorcery is this??? Listen I'm 48, and I've bought a lot of face cream 'stuff' over the years. Expensive stuff that did nothing. Finally started using Cerave thanks to my 19-year-old daughter and TikTok, lol. I decided to try the eye cream, and I noticed a difference the morning I started using it. The brightening is apparent. Love this stuff."" —Michelle Petrosh..."

mov_8FD794035C0DC5B8DA9B16DA778573DF,2025-07-01 08:22:06,pt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]Ney Lopes [ nl@neylopes.com.br ]   No final da última semana, o fundador da Amazon, Jeff Bezos,61, (a terceira pessoa mais rica do mundo) e a jornalista Lauren Sánchez, 55, casaram-se na pequena ilha privativa de San Giorgio Maggiore, em Veneza, acompanhados pelo canto de Matteo Bocelli, filho do tenor italiano Andrea Bocelli. Bezos ficou noivo de Sánchez em 2023, quatro anos após o fim de seu casamento de 25 anos com a romancista e filantropa MacKenzie Scott. As festividades duraram três dias. Bill Gates, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Tom Brady, a rainha Rania da Jordânia, Oprah Winfrey, Kris Jenner e Kim e Khloé Kardashian, assim como Ivanka Trump e Jared Kushner, estavam entre as celebridades presentes. “Com cartazes sem espaço para Bezos”, moradores de Veneza protestaram contra a ocupação da cidade com o o turismo em massa. Alegaram que o crescimento explosivo do turismo está tornando a cidade inabitável e dos riscos das mudanças climáticas. Em Paris, o Museu do Louvre fechou as portas por um dia, contra o descontrole do turismo. O prefeito de Veneza defende o turismo e diz que os “visitantes” são mais venezianos do que os manifestantes. Esse tipo de protesto cresce na Europa. As núpcias de Bezos caracterizaram verdadeiro “casamento de fadas”, com custos estimados em US$ 56 milhões, segundo a Reuters, mas não fará nem cócegas na sua fortuna, estimada em US$ 237 bilhões (R$ 1,3 trilhão). Esse valor corresponde em mais de 600 vezes o custo médio de um casamento nos EUA, que gira em torno de US$ 33.000.O bilionário doou quase US$ 3,6 milhões (R$ 19,8 milhões) a três organizações da cidade. Na cerimônia, a noiva estava com um vestido de gola alta e um véu de tule e renda da Dolce & Gabbana, usado por Sophia Loren para se casar com Cary Grant no filme Houseboat, de 1958. Nas outras comemorações do casamento, ela usou os seus costumeiros decotes, com fenda lateral, ousados e profundos, que já chamou a atenção de Mark Zuckerberg, 41, magnata e empresário norte-americano. O jornal britânico “The Guardian” anotou algumas curiosidades sobre o casamento de Bezos. A soma dos patrimônios dos convidados foi estimada em US$ 435 bilhões. O preço médio de um quarto dos hotéis reservados pelo casal para os convidados é de US$ 2.000 por noite (R$ 11.000). Isso representa cerca de US$ 900.000 (R$ 4,95 milhões) para três noites, considerando aproximadamente 150 quartos reservados. O buffet foi assinado pelo chef Fabrício Mellino, do restaurante Quattro Passi, com três estrelas Michelin, localizado em Nerano, perto de Nápoles. O preço é de cerca de US$ 1.800 (R$ 9.900) por pessoa, para esse tipo de serviço. O restaurante ficou fechado por quatro dias e o custo da contratação totalizou cerca de US$ 1,1 milhão (R$ 6,05 milhões). Além disso, o casal presenteou cada convidado com uma caixa de produtos e doces locais, incluindo taças e copos de cores vibrantes da Laguna~B, especialista em vidro de Murano, feitos a mão. Realmente, um casamento extravagante! Hoje na história: Nascimento da filantropa britânica Diana Spencer, a princesa de Gales (60 anos). Guerra Fria: o Pacto de Varsóvia é oficialmente dissolvido em uma reunião em Praga (30 anos). Dia Mundial das Bibliotecas 1944 – Início da Conferência de Breton Woods, a criação do Fundo Monetário Internacional. A lei que determinou a união dos Estados da Guanabara e Rio de Janeiro foi sancionada. 1979 – A Sony lançou o walkman. 1994 – Um novo plano econômico mudou a moeda brasileira do cruzeiro real para o real.

Presunto cru de primeira qualidade O “presunto artesanal cru Cangaira”, produzido em Macaíba, RN, pelo empresário Mano Targino, atinge níveis de qualidade semelhantes ao prosciutto italiano e ao “jamón pata negra”. Vitória de uma empresa genuinamente potiguar, que se afirma no competitivo mercado global.

mov_0DFD1F8ECF69FAB1F680EFD0FB1B76F1,2025-07-01 09:28:04,en,WEB,"  Fragrance aficionados are raving about a perfume that's been hailed as ""the best ever made"" by its loyal fans. At the reasonable price of £23.95, Calvin Klein's Eternity Moment for Women Eau De Parfum is capturing the hearts of purchasers who claim they ""can't imagine being without it"". Blending notes of lychee and guava with passionflower and musks, Eternity Moment delivers a delicate floral fragrance that users report has impressive lasting power. Crowned 'number one best-seller' in Amazon's fragrance category, this scent boasts an impressive tally of over 24,000 reviews on the platform, showcasing an average rating of 4.6 out of 5 stars. Those on the hunt for more affordable floral and musk perfumes might be keen to explore Cosmic by Kylie Jenner Eau de Parfum, presently £55 for a 100ml bottle at LookFantastic, or Narciso Rodriguez For Her Musc Noir, now just £54.99 for a 50ml bottle, slashed from £92 at The Perfume Shop. Meanwhile, back at Amazon, the Calvin Klein fragrance continues to attract glowing reviews, with many customers complimenting its delightful scent and durability. However, some remarks indicate it might be ""too sweet"", which serves as a reminder that scent preferences are highly individual. One enthusiastic customer raved: ""Absolute Game Changer. This has genuinely made such a difference-I didn't realise how much I needed it until I had it. Now I can't imagine being without it. It's reliable, well made, and just makes life that little bit better every day. Total game changer. If you're on the fence, take this as your sign to go for it!"" , reports the Liverpool Echo. Emma gushed: ""The best perfume ever made. You wanna know how good this perfume is? I have tried probably 30-40 perfumes in my life and never found one that I love AND actually stays on my skin. This lasts all day. Literally all day. I put it on yesterday after my bath about 6pm. . can still smell it 10am the next day and on clothes even longer. I love it that much I ordered another bottle a few days later as didn't wanna lose out on the amazing price. If you're contemplating it just get it it's incredible I've finally found my signature scent!"" . However, not everyone shared the same enthusiasm. A three-star reviewer noted: ""Not that keen on the scent when it arrived but will use it with other perfumes. Wish we could have small samples before buying."" Jackie commented: ""Very sweet smelling. Age range range for the young."" On the other hand, Maria praised the perfume, saying: ""Great! I recommend it: good price, great fragrance and great staying power. The best investment you can make is in yourself. You won't be disappointed."" For those who fancy sampling a variety of fragrances before investing in a full-sized bottle, the Sol de Janeiro Exclusive and Limited Edition Perfume Mist Discovery Set could be just the ticket. Currently reduced to £22.80, the set includes four 30ml bottles of their best-selling scents."

Once you spray in any direction that has hair, it automatically identifies the hair that needs to be removed. It is easily sprayed on and easily wiped off. No extra residue. Comes with four blades, and I say these blades are soft and gentle yet get the job done. Not sure why no one ever thought of coming up with a hair identifier spray.

53250758ddb4979f89fffaaa34e2ada2,2025-07-02 00:01:00,en,WEB,"  1. An absolutely genius device called a ""Supoon"" — this perfectly sized spoon not only helps you scrape every last bit of food from the container (think: peanut butter, yogurt, cream cheese, etc.) but also has a unique design that keeps it away from the countertop when you set it down! This is about to prevent SO many ""babe, stop leaving your peanut butter spoon on the counter"" arguments. Natalie Brown / BuzzFeed ""When I impulse-bought this mini spatula (called a ""supoon"") at the grocery store a few years ago, I knew it was good, but not THIS good. See that little dip in the neck? That means you can set it down on the counter and whatever's on it won't end up touching said counter. Here's a few of the many things I use this dishwasher-safe beauty for — and yep, it makes it into basically every dishwasher load, I use it THAT frequently. - Scraping every last bit of sauce, curry, salad dressing, or soup out of takeout or leftover containers, like in the picture above. This happens several times a week. I want every bit of all that flavor!! - Measuring out a few teaspoons of water when re-steaming takeout rice in the microwave. - Scraping out yogurt, hummus, salsa, hot sauce, peanut butter, expensive Bonne Maman jams, etc., etc., when I'm down to the last little bit of each. (It's too big for most beauty products, but that's fine.) - Mixing together a quick stir-fry sauce in a measuring cup, then scraping that sauce out of the cup into the pan, all with a single utensil. - Scrambling together a mixture of eggs and whatever else I want in a bowl and scraping all of that into a pan. - Scooping pancake batter my MIL sent over into a pan to make my 9-month-old fresh pancakes, including scraping the last bits out to get as much pancake as possible. Like, I know I functioned in the kitchen before I had this, but this saves me so much time scraping over and over with a spoon. And that price! A no-brainer. "" — Natalie Brown Get it from Amazon for $6.99 , and find more sizes and colors on the Dreamfarm Amazon Store Page . 2. Miss Mouth's Messy Eater Stain Treater Spray , which is so effective that you'll remain suspiciously calm the next time your tot's chocolate milk makes its way from their sippy cup to the couch cushion. Or when your glass of merlot faces a similar fate. Just spray, blot, rinse, and pour another. Heather Braga/BuzzFeed "" My 1-year-old is a big ice pop fan, so I've got a long life ahead of me to be filled with stain removal. In the above photo I held her while she sucked down a red ice pop on a 90 degree day. Naturally, it dripped all over my white tank top (note to self: stop wearing white around these kids). I was actually kind of excited because it meant I got to put my newly purchased bottle of Miss Mouth's Messy Eater Stain Treater Spray to the test! I followed the directions on the bottle that said to dampen the stained area, spray it with the stain remover, then pop it into the washing machine as usual. What do ya know — it really worked! Completely cleared away all the red stains! Not sure what witchcraft has been used to make this product, but I'm here for it."" — Heather Braga Promising review: ""My 1-year-old has taco meat stains ALL over the sleeves of his shirt. The stains were 2–3 days old, too. I sprayed the shirt, let it sit for about 15 minutes, and then washed the shirt with regular laundry soap. Almost every bit of the stains came out. Definitely buying bulk in this product!"" — Sloan Avery Get it from Amazon for $7.97 (available in three sizes and multipacks). 3. A Ninja Swirl machine that makes soft serve ice cream at the touch of a button, which is truly the future Spy Kids promised us. You can also use it to whip up frozen yogurt, frozen custard, sorbet, milkshakes, and scooped ice cream. Heather Braga / BuzzFeed ""I have this machine and can assure you it is actually worth every penny. IDK about you, but where I live in New York, it's gotten VERY expensive to go out for ice cream (or buy it to bring home). Now that I have a family of four, it just makes more sense to find a way to make our favorite flavors at home. Setting the Ninja Swirl up was very simple; the ""hardest"" part is just remembering to freeze the ""base"" of your ice creams ahead of time so they're ready to be ""spun"" when you want to eat them. I've seen all over TikTok how people 'meal prep' their ice creams for the week and just pop 'em in the freezer (incredible). Anyways, the soft serve feature is incredible!..."

Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and un-touched. Delivery was very quick so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hyper sensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive."" —Tracey Agopian Get a ten-pack from Amazon for $9.99. 3.

This is a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lippie that's just a step above the ""no makeup makeup"" look, giving the perfect subtly polished effect. I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag.

Manuel Belgrano, el general que se había ganado la admiración de todos, atravesaba uno de sus peores momentos. Las ruidosas derrotas en las batallas de Vilcapugio y Ayohuma lo habían dejado en una mala posición, no solo política. Abandonado a su suerte y lejos de la gloria, estaba a merced de lo que sobre su persona decidieran los poderosos de siempre, aquellos que poco y nada sabían de las tragedias del campo de batalla. No tenía opción: lo esperaban la cárcel y el escarnio, o aceptar a ciegas la misión que le encomendaba el gobierno de Buenos Aires en el Viejo Continente. Dijo que sí. Pero nunca imaginó que lo que tenía por delante era una de las misiones más descabelladas de la historia del Río de la Plata y que su compañero de viaje sería el siempre ambiguo Bernardino Rivadavia. En esa deriva alucinada, que se iniciaría en una Río de Janeiro imperial y seguiría en el Londres de la Regencia, tendría que lidiar a sol y a sombra con Lord Strangford, Manuel de Sarratea, el bufonesco conde Domingo Cabarrús y toda una serie de personajes brumosos, artífices de las más oscuras intrigas. Viajes, complots, traiciones, amores fugaces, lealtades que duran lo que un soplo y otras que se firman con sangre. Con un pie en un hecho real y otro en las elucubraciones de aquello que bien pudo haber sido, con el pulso de un thriller de espionaje y la atención que reclaman, siempre, las grandes figuras históricas. Una novela única y que solo un reconocido historiador podía escribir. ◀️ #ebook #epub #mobi #kindle #pdf #kindleespañol #libroelectronico #librodigital #ebookdigital #ebookdigitales #novedad2025 #lectura2025 #queleer #librosdigitales #novela #novelas"

Peach Slices Redness Relief Color Correcting Cream for those days when your skin seems to be pitching a fit about something or another. This not only provides soothing, moisturizing ingredients like aloe and green algae, but it also has a subtle color-correcting tint that tones down redness. Think of it as a little tube of damage control for when your skin needs extra TLC. Promising review: ""I'm not one to normally leave reviews, but this is worth it. I've literally had this product for two days. I have severe rosacea on my nose. It's so bad I usually have to wear foundation to hide it because it's so noticeable. I've tried numerous products and serums with no luck, and honestly, I didn't expect this one to be any different. However, after only two days (probably applying it 4–5 times), almost all of the redness is gone! I'm in disbelief at the wonders it has done. I will without a doubt be stocking up on this product!"" —Tiffany Price: $19.88 2. Neutrogena Collagen Bank Facial Moisturizer that's basically an investment in your future face. Collagen helps keep things pinchably plump, bouncy, and glowy, which is great. But the real power player in this cream is the bakuchiol — an active ingredient which can boost cell turnover and smooth skin texture — which is basically retinol's less dramatic cousin. No joke, this study suggests that bakuchiol is just as effective as retinol while being way less likely to cause irritation. So basically, you get all the glow with none of the drama. It's a win-win. Promising review: ""The Neutrogena Collagen Bank moisturizer is making my skin feel smoother. It does not irritate my skin, and I really like the dispenser. I plan to keep using it."" —Serendipity Price: $19.97 (originally $22.97) 3. Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream because your skincare routine doesn't stop at your neck. It smells like summer vacation in a tub — think vanilla, salted caramel, and pistachio — and the fast-absorbing formula is infused with caffeine-rich guarana extract to visibly smooth and tighten. Your group chat will be demanding a scent rundown. Promising review: ""My skin is usually sensitive to anything with fragrances, this on the other hand, is perfect. It leaves my skin soft, and the fragrance ISN'T overpowering like other products. I would say over the span of a week or so I noticed a drastic improvement in my skin!"" —anonymous Price: $19.99+ (available in two sizes) 4. Aquaphor Lip Repair Ointment to rescue your lips when they feel like they've survived a beating. With a powerhouse blend of shea butter, beeswax, vitamin E, and chamomile, this ultra-soothing balm helps restore moisture, calms irritation, and keeps flakes at bay. Stop peeling and start slathering. Promising review: ""This product is highly recommended for maintaining moisture or replenishing moisture to chapped lips. I have sold lip conditioners that were 20 bucks. No need to pay that much money. Use this!"" —Tina Price: $8.36 for two 5. Or NYX Professional Makeup Fat Oil for a hydration boost that also gives your lips a juicy shine. With lots of moisturizing and antioxidant-rich ingredients, this lip oil is protective, long-lasting, and nonsticky. The gorg hint of color and lovely scent are just icing on the cake...."

João 15v12. 6-E amar o seu irmão não é dar-lhe coisas ou dinheiro, mas perdoar os seus pecados. 7-E assim, todo aquele que diz que te ama porque te dá coisas ou dinheiro. 8-Mas quando você peca contra ele, ele não perdoa seus pecados, ele mente, ele não te ama, porque amar significa perdoar. 9-E há muitos de nós que dizemos que amamos nossos irmãos porque lhes damos coisas ou dinheiro. 10-Mas mentimos porque quando eles pecam contra nós, não perdoamos seus pecados. 11-Portanto, quando Cristo vier, o perdão será exigido de todos os homens. Mateus 6:14-15. 13-Porque ninguém nesta terra que pode fazer todas as coisas boas em uma pessoa, aquele que pode fazer todas as coisas boas em uma pessoa é Deus Pai somente. 14-Porque se você fizer essas coisas boas para seu irmão, sempre permanecerão as outras coisas boas que você não pode fazer por ele que ele faz em si mesmo e que os outros homens fazem por ele. 15-Portanto, quem quiser escapar da ira de Deus deve perdoar os homens suas ofensas.

788194AC4F6EE38BAA09391FD01E85A6,2025-07-02 08:15:45,en,PRINT,"  In a 49-page lawsuit filed in California, Lululemon accused the retail wholesaler of selling knockoff versions of its Scuba clothing and popular ABC men's pants. For nearly as long as mankind has worn fancy things, someone out there has been trying to copy those things. Ancient artisans cribbed from each other's designs. Victorian hustlers duped diamond jewelry with shimmery paste. Christian Dior, the godfather of high fashion himself, was believed to sell his own designs to lesser known producers, who could make cheaper versions. For the modern athleisure giant Lululemon, however, the duping has gone too far. In a lawsuit filed in California on June 25, the company accused the wholesale retailer Costco of selling knockoff sweatshirts, jackets and other activewear at a fraction of what Lululemon charges. Successfully suing over knockoffs is notoriously difficult for fashion brands and designers, in part because copyright laws are often vague, experts say. Lululemon's case seeks restitution and payment from Costco, which it said profited off Lululemon's ''sweat equity'' and damaged the Lululemon brand. Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. What is Lululemon accusing Costco of doing? Lululemon said Costco is selling knockoffs of its Scuba hoodies and sweatshirts, Define jackets and popular ABC pants for men. Using design images and side-by-side comparisons, Lululemon, in a 49-page court filing, argued that Costco sold jackets and hoodies -- made by clothing manufacturers such as Danskin, Spyder and Jockey -- using terms in its marketing similar to what Lululemon uses. In one instance cited in the lawsuit, Costco sold a turquoise Danskin-made pullover -- which at a glance looks remarkably similar to Lululemon's Scuba sweatshirt -- with the color ''Tidewater Teal.'' It's the same way Lululemon describes the color of its own teal sweatshirts. Lululemon also accuses Costco of manufacturing a knockoff of its ABC pants -- which retail for about $130 -- under Costco's own brand, Kirkland, and selling them for $20. Contracts between vendors like Danskin and Jockey and retailers like Costco often include provisions like indemnification clauses, which can specify that vendors bear financial responsibility for legal issues that could arise from their products. It's unclear whether such clauses exist in this case. How has Lululemon dealt with dupes? Lululemon, with its unadorned styles and high prices, is famously a target for knockoffs. Hashtags on TikTok direct shoppers to cheap, duped versions of the brand's leggings and athletic wear. Since Lululemon's inception in Canada in 1998, fashion law experts in America say that the brand has been on the forefront of design trademark law, which is famously lax in the United States as compared to other markets, like Europe. ''They absolutely have been on the forefront of trying to find ways to protect their intellectual property,'' said Susan Scafidi, the founder and director of the Fashion Law Institute at the Fordham School of Law. Protecting trademarks, logos and labels is one thing. Protecting the design of a garment is another.'' ''In Europe that's easy. Design rights, done,'' said Ms. Scafidi. '' In the U.S., well in Lululemon terms, they have to warm up and stretch.'' Still, dupes are enough of a concern that Lululemon held several ''dupe'' exchanges in 2023, offering holders of confirmed ''dupe'' leggings to bring their clothes to designated sites and trade them for the real thing. At the time, Nikki Neuburger, Lululemon's chief branding officer, said it was an effort to acknowledge ''dupes'' as part of fashion while protecting the original producer. ''We saw it as a really fun way to play into something that is a real part of our culture, but in a way that really puts the focus back on the original,'' Ms. Neuburger told CNN. What is 'dupe' culture? Many millennials probably recall a school or family trip to New York City in the 2000s, when a coveted status symbol of adolescence was a pair of sunglasses or a candy-colored knockoff designer purse, bought after haggling with a vendor on Canal Street. But today's dupe market has gone digital, and TikTok has become a prime platform. Videos with the ''dupe'' hashtag have billions of views on the platform. For many in Gen Z, good dupes have become almost as coveted as originals. Many influencers promote knockoffs of Stanley mugs, Lululemon pants, sneakers and designer jewelry. ''Dupes are not only out there in the open, they are a point of pride. These are the modern versions of being an extreme coupon clipper or a bargain hunter, and it has lost a lot of its shame,'' Ms. Scafidi said. But designers are increasingly trying to stamp out knockoffs, and take back brands' power. In November 2024, Sol de Janeiro sued over dupes of its popular scented mist sprays. The year before that, Deckers, which owns the Ugg boot brand, sued over dupes of its ankle shearling boot. This May, Deckers sued Costco over the same thing, claiming the retailer's far cheaper Shearling slippers were a direct copy of the UGG equivalent. If the Lululemon suit succeeds, Ms. Scafidi said, it could rewind some of that clock, making original designer versions once again palatable. ''Lulu is trying to buy back some of that territory,'' Ms. Scafidi said. If they win, ''that will be a huge social victory.''"

A powerful call to defend hard-won rights under threat: over 90 legal rollbacks in the past three years, 62 countries still criminalize homosexuality, and marriage equality is recognized in only 38. The project, which honors those who ignited the fight for LGBTQ+ rights, was made possible through a collaboration with the production company Dim Sum and the support of organizations including Redi, Fundación 26 de Diciembre, Yaaj, Colectivo Sol, Colombia Diversa, Movilh, and Grand Rapids Pride, all of whom contributed to the research process. MADRID, July 02, 2025     Over the past three years, more than 90 legislative changes across different countries have rolled back essential rights for the LGBTQ+ community, reversing decades of hard-fought progress. Equally alarming: homosexuality is still criminalized in 62 countries, and marriage equality is officially recognized in just 38. In the face of this global backlash, listening to those who've fought this battle before has never been more urgent. In response, LLYC, the global Marketing and Corporate Affairs firm, is launching , a campaign that rekindles the original protest banners of the first Pride marches, returning them to the streets in 2025. Created in partnership with Dim Sum and with the backing of LGBTQ+ organizations from five countries, the campaign is a tribute to the roots of queer activism — at a time when past victories are once again under threat. shines a spotlight on senior LGBTQ+ activists — key figures from the earliest Pride protests — who re-emerge today as living symbols of memory, courage, and resistance. Their stories don't just honor history, they inspire action in the present and strengthen the collective will to protect the future. The initiative brings historic protest banners back into the spotlight in Pride marches this 2025, in cities such as Bogotá, Mexico City, Madrid, and Santiago de Chile. This was made possible through close collaboration with frontline LGBTQ+ advocacy organizations, including Redi, Fundación 26 de Diciembre, Yaaj, Colectivo Sol, Colombia Diversa, Movilh, and Grand Rapids Pride, who supported LLYC throughout the research and development process. At the heart of the campaign is a powerful short film featuring Ramón Linaza, a senior Spanish activist who revisits the early days of Pride. Through his story, we journey across decades of progress and confront the urgent challenges the community faces today. His voice is joined by nearly a dozen conversations with other senior activists from around the world— a multigenerational chorus that weaves together past and present, and reminds us why these signs of Pride still matter. The project's web experience allows viewers to dive deeper into each story: Who were the original banner holders? What was the world like when they first marched? And how do they see themselves reflected in today's struggles? Through a visual and emotional journey, the campaign presents then-and-now portraits taken in the same locations as the original photos with the same banners, either carefully restored or faithfully recreated by hand, to show that their messages still hold true. "" is our way of standing up for LGBTQ+ rights at a time when backlash is growing in many parts of the world,” says David González Natal, Partner at LLYC and project lead. “This campaign revives the legacy of those who helped spark the movement and whose voices haven't always been heard. What they wrote decades ago still matters today."" This action is part of LLYC's ongoing commitment to diversity and inclusion. The firm was recognized by HRC Equidad Mexico as one of the Best Places to Work for LGBTQ+ Talent in 2024, and has developed several award-winning campaigns such as , Rainbot, Compañías y diversidad LGBTIQ+, and Transparentes, known for their innovation and social impact. In addition, through the Fundación José Antonio Llorente, LLYC actively partners with nonprofit organizations to promote job opportunities for LGBTQ+ youth living in vulnerable conditions.

Nesta matéria, apresentamos cinco destinos especialmente indicados para quem quer viver essa experiência de forma independente, explorando novos lugares no seu próprio ritmo. As opções vão desde retiros de bem-estar e passeios por ilhas paradisíacas até mergulhos com snorkel e viagens urbanas repletas de cultura e história. Uma viagem urbana por Liverpool, no Reino Unido, é uma opção a ser considerada. Liverpool é um destino muito recomendado por viajantes devido aos seus simpáticos habitantes. Conhecida pelos Beatles, pelo estádio de futebol Anfield e pelo rio Mersey, essa cidade animada está cheia de “scousers” (como são chamados os moradores locais) acolhedores e oferece atividades interessantes – um ambiente perfeito para viajantes individuais. É possível visitar o vibrante Cavern Club, um antigo bar de jazz que se tornou o berço da música pop britânica e, para ter uma visão dos bastidores do Abbey Road Studios e fazer uma viagem no Yellow Submarine, uma dica é visitar a exibição “The Beatles Story”, dedicada à famosa banda de rock. O programa de revitalização urbana em andamento e a orla renovada da cidade estão transformando seu antigo centro em um dos destinos mais agradáveis e adaptados para ciclistas no Norte da Inglaterra. O viajante pode pedalar pelos parques e mergulhar na herança cultural da cidade, que inclui seus muitos edifícios tombados e duas grandes catedrais, a antiga e a nova. Um passeio pelo Georgian Quarter apresenta uma amostra bem preservada do passado, com suas belas casas geminadas e ruas charmosas repletas de pubs históricos. Outra opção é a região industrial-chique Baltic Triangle, que possui excelentes tavernas de cerveja artesanal e é outro ótimo lugar para conversar com os moradores locais. Se você é mais aventureiro, um mergulho com snorkel, em Ko Ngai, na Tailândia pode ser uma boa opção. Com praias de areia branca, águas cristalinas e palmeiras, o Ko Ngai é um destino ao longo da costa Sul de Andaman, onde viajantes solo descobrirão um fascinante mundo subaquático com vida marinha tropical. Rodeada por corais, essa pequena ilha densamente arborizada faz parte do Parque Nacional de Koh Lanta. O local é um paraíso secreto para quem quer curtir a praia na própria companhia, enquanto relaxa em uma rede e aproveita a água. Os recifes de coral ao longo da costa da ilha são um lugar perfeito para praticar mergulho com snorkel ou cilindro e observar as diferentes espécies de peixes. Outras atividades famosas oferecidas na região incluem caiaque e stand-up paddle. Nesse destino fora dos circuitos habituais, onde não há estradas ou grandes lojas por perto, é possível desfrutar de passeios em um barco e conhecer as ilhas vizinhas de Koh Mook, com sua famosa Caverna Esmeralda, e Koh Kradan, com outros recifes de coral. Com muitos viajantes brasileiros indicando que querem ter tempo para relaxar durante as férias, encontrar um refúgio relaxante para a mente e o corpo é uma ótima maneira de fazer uma viagem solo. Muito recomendada por viajantes da agência online Booking.com para a prática de ioga, Bad Füssing, na Alemanha, é uma cidade termal famosa no distrito de Passau, na Baviera. É o lugar perfeito para as pessoas que viajam sozinhas em busca de uma pausa de bem-estar e relaxamento profundo em um ambiente idílico. É possível escolher entre uma ampla seleção de aulas de ioga e retiros disponíveis, incluindo práticas de yin e vinyasa, em níveis que vão do iniciante ao avançado. Uma dica é mergulhar os músculos nos banhos termais curativos pelos quais essa cidade é famosa e aproveitar os benefícios para a saúde que a água mineral quente proporciona. Ou, ainda, mexer o corpo durante um passeio a pé ao longo do rio Inn, em Passau, que percorre as vielas históricas da cidade romana de Passau, situada a um curto trajeto de carro e aproveitar para explorar suas duas pontes, a Catedral de Santo Estêvão, de estilo barroco, e o antigo Palácio do Bispo. Para quem gosta de natureza, não há lugar melhor para viajar sozinho do que em meio a colinas e morros cheios de belezas naturais, em Búzios, que está situada em uma península oceânica a Leste do Rio de Janeiro. Esse balneário chique é repleto de boutiques, restaurantes elegantes e pousadas de luxo. Além disso, é muito recomendado por causa da natureza. Existem inúmeras maneiras de se conectar: o viajante pode fazer um passeio tranquilo ao longo do calçadão de madeira em direção à Praia de João Fernandes, apreciando as casas coloridas e estátuas de bronze de figuras históricas. Ao fim da caminhada, uma boa pedida é aproveitar para nadar nas três pequenas enseadas e também é possível fazer um passeio de barco em Búzios pelas águas azul-turquesa ao redor da península. Atividades cheias de adrenalina, como trekking e mergulho com cilindro, são bastante procuradas e revelam a singularidade da fauna e flora da região. Há muitas maneiras para conhecer uma ilha. No entanto, para quem quer visitar mais de um destino e conhecer diferentes culturas, tradições e culinárias, fazer um passeio que inclui a visita a diversas ilhas é uma excelente maneira de explorar mais em uma jornada solo. As remotas Yaeyama Islands, no Japão, são um paraíso escondido a Sudoeste de Okinawa. Elas são famosas devido às suas lindas praias, pôr do sol e paisagens de cana-de-açúcar em tons de verde-claro. Com algumas das melhores selvas subtropicais e manguezais do país, as ilhas também oferecem o melhor mergulho com snorkel e cilindro do Japão. Outra característica das Yaeyama Islands é a facilidade com que é possível explorá-las para descobrir sua diversidade. Serviços de balsa frequentes circulam entre a cidade de Ishigajo e as ilhas próximas, permitindo ao viajante visitar três ou quatro em uma viagem. Recomenda-se usar a ilha de Kohama como base e desfrutar de passeios do tipo “bate e volta” para as ilhas vizinhas de Taketomi e Ishigaki. Se você está planejando tirar férias na melhor companhia que existe – a sua própria –, aproveite estas sugestões. Escolha o destino que mais combina com o seu estilo e entre em contato com seu agente de viagens para transformar esse plano em realidade. ."

Calvin Klein's Eternity Moment for Women Eau De Parfum, priced at an affordable £23.94, has captivated many with its aroma to the extent that they ""can't imagine being without it."" Eternity Moment combines the sweetness of lychee and guava with passionflower and musks to create a light floral scent renowned for its lasting impression. It has clinched the title of 'number one best-seller' in its category on Amazon, amassing an impressive 24,793 reviews on the platform alone, with an average score of 4.6 out of 5 stars. For those on the hunt for a bargain with a penchant for floral/musk fragrances, Cosmic by Kylie Jenner Eau de Parfum might be worth a look, with a 100ml bottle currently discounted to £44 at LookFantastic.

Shoppers are singing praises for its delightful scent and durability, though some have noted it as ""too sweet"", indicating that it may not suit everyone's taste. One customer enthused: ""Absolute Game Changer. This has genuinely made such a difference-I didn't realise how much I needed it until I had it. Now I can't imagine being without it. It's reliable, well made, and just makes life that little bit better every day. Total game changer. If you're on the fence, take this as your sign to go for it!"" , reports the Liverpool Echo. Emma shared her thoughts: ""The best perfume ever made. You wanna know how good this perfume is? I have tried probably 30-40 perfumes in my life and never found one that I love AND actually stays on my skin. This lasts all day. Literally all day. I put it on yesterday after my bath about 6pm. . can still smell it 10am the next day and on clothes even longer. I love it that much I ordered another bottle a few days later as didn't wanna lose out on the amazing price. If you're contemplating it just get it it's incredible I've finally found my signature scent!"" . However, not everyone was as enamoured. A three-star review read: ""Not that keen on the scent when it arrived but will use it with other perfumes. Wish we could have small samples before buying."" Jackie offered her opinion: ""Very sweet smelling. Age range for the young."" Yet, Maria recommended: ""Great! I recommend it: good price, great fragrance and great staying power. The best investment you can make is in yourself. You won't be disappointed.""

Currently priced at £28.50, this set includes four 30ml bottles of their best-selling scents."

From July 8th through July 11th, we'll be wading through the mountains of bargains for you to find some of the best deals in every category. For *now*, we're reminding you to sign up for a Prime membership so you can take advantage of the sale! 1. A useful waterproof baby carrier if you'd appreciate having your hands free when you take your little one in the pool. It's made of a fast-drying neoprene material (think surf suits) and has soft, padded straps. Promising review: ""Absolutely love this product. I used it when my son was only about 6–9-months-old, and I still use it now as he is 15-months-old. I just love this product. It is so easy to use the babies. Love it as they get to be in the water as well; this product also dries very quickly. Highly recommend it to anyone who wants to be in the water with their children. An added benefit is that you are hands free!"" —Hannabelle Price: $89.99 (available in six colors) 2. A pair of sockless shoe liners because the return of the sun also means the return of stinky, sweaty feet. Bleh! Sometimes, you don't want or need a layer of socks, and that's where these washable and absorbent shoe liners come in handy! The liners come with trimming guidelines so that you can cut the insert to your desired size. Promising review: ""I can't recommend these inserts enough! After a week of heavy use, they hardly smell. Pop them in the wash, and they are ready to go again! Super comfy and doesn't move around. So nice to have in shoes you don't feel like wearing socks with! Plus, so many fun patterns!"" —Vicky L. Parr Price: $9.99+ (available in two sizes [fits women's sizes 6–13] and four colors) 3. A Sol de Janeiro shimmering body oil with SPF 50 for a dazzling glow without the white cast or the greasy feel — because my sweat glands are already in overdrive the minute temps rise above 80 degrees. And it's Sol de Janeiro, so you know it smells amazing. Duh! Promising review: ""I use this on vacation every time. As a Black girl, it makes my skin GLOWWWW! and the SPF is great, and I feel protected always."" —Jilly Price: $30 4. A lavender-scented Downy laundry odor remover to really get into the fibers of your clothing and linens to remove odor-causing residue. If you're sweating up a storm in the warmer months or stinking up your clothes in front of a campfire (worth it for the s'mores, tho!) , you'll wanna keep this on hand. Promising review: ""My husband is a Master Mechanic and obviously works with different oils, greases, and fluids. Even though I use really good detergent, stain booster, and good liquid softener along with a pre-wash, it never seemed like I could get all of the smells out. Not now, this product is amazing!!! My husband's work clothes come out smelling so fresh! I was actually supposed to, but it really does a great job. Now I use it with all my laundry and it's never smelled so good."" —Joann Baker Price: $12.97..."

The last sunburn I got in Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, stained my back for months, so lesson learned. Given that I've never been a diehard sunscreen enthusiast, I've never had a solid favorite. I recently got into the Sol de Janeiro Rio Radiance Body Spray SPF 50 because it has such a unique summer scent of Cheirosa '97, and it applies effortlessly. Of course, I've used the viral Vacation Sunscreen Classic Whip SPF 30 because what kind of beauty writer would I be otherwise? But when it comes to the face, it wasn't until my first Candela Matrix Pro radiofrequency microneedling treatment that I found my go-to sunscreen. The team at Candela sent me off with a goodie bag filled with post-microneedling care must-haves: Cetaphil Daily Oil-Free Hydrating Lotion and my new go-to SPF, La Roche-Posay's Anthelios Sunscreen-Gentle Lotion. La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen-Gentle Lotion “Mineral sunscreens like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Sunscreen-Gentle Lotion have zinc or titanium dioxide, which are active mineral ingredients that protect the skin from UV rays,” explains Beauty Villa Vergara founder Dr. Mariana Vergara, who performed the three-session radiofrequency microneedling treatment on me. “They sit on the top of the skin and reflect the UV radiation, acting like a physical barrier. These types of sunscreens are recommended for sensitive skin or for its use after treatments like microneedling radiofrequency.” Buy At Dermstore$26 Buy At Amazon$26 Free Returns | Free Shipping Aside from being post-procedure-approved, Vergara says that this affordable sunscreen, which targets both UVA and UVB rays, is an especially solid option for users with oily skin, thanks to the inclusion of lipo hydroxy acid, which can help keep breakouts and shine at bay. “[Lipo Hydroxy Acid] is a derivative of salicylic acid, and it can renew oily skin,” she says. “It also contains vitamin E, which is a great antioxidant that helps neutralize free radicals,” she says. Given Vergara's approval, along with hundreds of glowing reviews from Amazon shoppers, I knew I had a winner in my hands—and after using it consistently for a few weeks, I understand the hype. Not only did it protect my skin from the sun post-treatment (when the skin is extra sensitive to light), but my makeup went on extremely smoothly over the SPF—and it stayed in place for hours. I've gone on to take it with me everywhere, but the product was really put to the test on my birthday when I stayed at the stunning Casa Del Mar in sunny Santa Monica. I slathered on the SPF from head to toe and spent the day lounging by the pool, with an early evening seaside stroll on the sand before dinner. Despite the hot temps, I piled my makeup on strong over the gentle sunscreen. To my surprise, the SPF helped keep my makeup looking smooth and velvety (no excess shine!) throughout the day, and I was left with not a burn in sight. Three months after regular use, I've decided that not only does the non-greasy SPF protect my face and body, but it truly does serve as a remarkable makeup primer as well, which is one less product I have to pack with me when I travel. I may not use this SPF every single day, but when I do reach for a sunscreen, La Roche-Posay's Anthelios Sunscreen-Gentle Lotion is the one I grab.

Eos Marshmallow ""Super Balm"" lip treatment from the brand's ""secret menu"" so good that reviewers say it's better than Carmex for healing and better than Summer Fridays for quality. Lip care that also tastes like you're perpetually eating a s'more for less than $5?? My friends, life is good. Check out a TikTok of the marshmallow lip treatment in action. Promising review: ""My new must-have! My number one go-to for healing lips was Carmex. This beat it. I love the consistency (very creamy/smooth), it's not heavily flavored or goopy, and it obviously smells amazing. It isn't overbearing and also doesn't keep coating your mouth like the Eos stick balms (still great, but more wax)."" —Breanah Shirazi Get ti from Amazon for $5.89 (also available in Strawberry Acai). 2. An affordable, Lululemon-esque longline sports bra so comfy, supportive, and versatile that reviewers love it both for outdoor workouts, gym use, *and* errand running. This is designed to be supportive without being too compressive, with lightweight fabric that keeps you breezy in the heat. Promising review: ""LOVE. It is super comfortable to wear and is great for supporting my chest when I go on a run. Doesn't collect sweat, very nice and cool material for hotter environments. I have it is so many colors because I love them so much. HIGHLY recommend!"" —Cheyenne Get it from Amazon for $19.99 (available in women's sizes XS–3XL and 29 colors). 3. Catrice ""Instant Awake"" Under Eye Brightener, which will be your holy grail for concealing and brightening dark circles under your eyes when your summer schedule is throwing you for a loop. This lightweight, color-adapting formula is designed for truly ~invisible~ coverage that makes a drastic difference — one that a lot of reviewers compare to the $33 Becca version. The color-adaptive formula is designed so one of four shades will work on any skin tone. Promising review: ""Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it."" —Monica T. Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades). 4. Jergens Natural Glow Firming Self Tanner Body Lotion to give you a gradual-building, vacation-worthy ~sunkissed glow~ over the course of just a few days. Not only is this easy peasy to apply compared to other finickier, streaking lotions, but it's formulated with collagen and elastin to help your skin appear firmer *and* glowier, and a HECK of a lot cheaper than its competitors. Promising review: ""I'm really impressed with this product. It's very easy to apply, the same way you would any lotion. It absorbs quickly into the skin. There is a very light, pleasant, fragrance. I had no issues with application or streaks. The tanning lotion gives a nice bronze appearance to the skin which is what I was looking for. The sunless tanner allows you to continue to build the color until you reach your desired look."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $10.47 (available in Fair to Medium, Medium to Deep, and several sizes). 5. A tinted lip balm so close to the same magic as ""Black Honey,"" TikTok's beloved $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique, that it will genuinely startle you — especially when you see the price...."

La protesta es encabezada por comisarios, delegados y transportistas de localidades como La Calera, Las Marías, Puente de Fierro, Pablo Galeana, Xolapa y El Playón. Daniel Rosas Martínez, coordinador de comisariados y representante de Xaltianguis, explicó que una de las demandas centrales es la reconstrucción del Hospital Básico Comunitario de esa localidad, que permanece inoperante y con daños estructurales desde antes del paso de los huracanes Otis y John. “Hoy no tenemos rayos X, quirófano, sala de partos ni ambulancia. Hay equipos de más de 10 millones de pesos que se están echando a perder por filtraciones”, denunció. Los manifestantes exigen ser atendidos directamente por los titulares de dependencias como la Secretaría de Salud federal, el Instituto Mexicano del Bienestar y la Comisión Federal de Electricidad (CFE), antes de considerar levantar el bloqueo. Se prevé que otras 200 personas se sumen a lo largo del día.

Esta obra es responsabilidad de CAPASEG, SDUOPOT y Conagua, según los organizadores. Otro de los reclamos es un adeudo de más de 150 millones de pesos por parte de la CFE a ejidatarios de La Tortolita, correspondiente al pago de derechos de vía y renta de tierras que no se ha cubierto desde hace más de cinco años. “Traemos más de 150 peticiones, y no son nuevas. Llevan años sin atenderse. No hay obra prioritaria municipal. Nos han dado largas y nadie responde”, acusó Rosas Martínez. Hasta el momento, ninguna autoridad se ha presentado a dialogar.

Tudo isso com um jatinho particular restrito para 48 pessoas. Essa é uma das propostas da rede de hotéis Four Seasons para os turistas de luxo que querem fazer viagens de “volta ao mundo” da forma mais confortável e exclusiva possível. A Private Jet Experience é uma das ofertas de hospitalidade mais sofisticadas da empresa. Todos os trajetos são feitos em um jato da Airbus personalizado, com as cabines mais espaçosas da categoria. Durante os voos, os viajantes têm um concierge, um chef, um diretor de experiências e um médico sempre à disposição. Ao chegar nos destinos, as hospedagens são feitas em hotéis ou resorts — da Four Seasons, claro. Por ora, apenas os trechos em alto-mar não são operados diretamente pela rede. Mas não seria surpreendente se esse cenário mudasse em breve: em junho, a companhia anunciou seu primeiro “hotel-iate”. - LEIA TAMBÉM: Para estar bem-informado sobre viagens, estilo, tecnologia, esporte e bem-estar, veja como receber a newsletter de Lifestyle do Seu Dinheiro A exclusividade e a personalização do roteiro cobram o seu custo. Para 2027, o pacote mais barato sai a partir de US$ 167 mil (R$ 905 mil) por pessoa. A demanda, no entanto, está aquecida. As reservas de 2025 já superaram as do ano anterior, segundo o vice-presidente executivo, Marc Speichert. Para 2026, as quatro experiências confirmadas já estão com reservas abertas. Leia Também A Four Seasons divulgou recentemente os pacotes para 2027, que vão incluir até uma visita privativa à escultura David, de Michelangelo. Quanto custa fazer uma viagem de luxo com o jatinho particular da Four Seasons A primeira partida de 2027 acontece já no dia 20 de janeiro. Na Uncharted Discovery, os viajantes partem de Los Angeles, fazem paradas no México, na Colômbia e na Costa Rica. A jornada acaba na Argentina, com passagem por Buenos Aires e depois uma expedição para a Antártica. Os valores começam em US$ 234 mil (R$ 1,3 milhão) por pessoa. Aproveitando a febre do turismo no Japão e no continente asiático em geral, a expedição Asia Unveiled passa por diversos destinos que estão no hype. Uma das experiências mais interessantes nesse roteiro é a visita ao Mercado de Tsukiji, em Tóquio. Por lá, os turistas poderão aprender a fazer sushi com um chef Michelin. É o trajeto mais barato da temporada: são US$ 167 mil por pessoa. Em março, a International Intrigue passa por quatro continentes e faz um mix entre destinos clássicos, como Paris e Florença, e outros mais fora do radar, como Hoi An (no Vietnã) e Tanzânia. É nesta opção que os viajantes poderão ter acesso à oficina em que Michelangelo esculpiu a estátua de David. Para viver isso, é preciso desembolsar a partir de US$ 230 mil (R$ 1,24 milhão) por pessoa. O último roteiro confirmado para 2027 é o Timeless Encounters. A partir de US$ 235 mil (R$ 1,27 milhão), os turistas vão ao Taj Mahal, assistem ao pôr do sol no prédio mais alto do mundo, em Dubai, conhecem a Sydney Opera House e curtem um resort cinco-estrelas em Bora Bora.

At Sol de Janeiro, we built a real-time Amazon Operations Hub—powered by Databricks and DOMO—that drives decisions across inventory, profitability, and marketing ROI. See how the Databricks Lakehouse and DOMO dashboards work together to simplify workflows, surface actionable insights, and enable smarter decisions across the business—from frontline operators to the executive suite. In this session, you'll get a behind-the-scenes look at how we unified trillions of rows from NetSuite, Amazon, Shopify, and carrier systems into a single source of truth. We'll show how this hub streamlined cross-functional workflows, eliminated manual reporting, and laid the foundation for AI-powered forecasting and automation.

Blame it on the huge selection, speedy shipping, and simple return process, but let's just say I put my Prime account to good use—especially when it comes to beauty products. Whether it's a TikTok-viral lip stain or a cult-classic Korean essence, I've placed more orders in the last year than I'd like to admit. At the time, it was bad news for my bank account, but now, it's good news for you because I know which Amazon beauty products are actually worth ordering, and right in time for Prime Day, too. This year, Prime Day deals are happening from July 8 to 11. During the sale, Prime members can score big discounts on thousands of products, including the best of the beauty category. Excited? Me too. Keep scrolling to see my official, beauty editor–approved shopping guide. Wonderskin Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain - Adore I have to start with a product I use almost every single day—Wonderskin's Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain. It went viral on TikTok a few months ago, and once I tested it, I could see why. Apply the dark-blue liquid to the lips (don't worry—it doesn't stay that way), wait a few minutes to let it dry, and peel it off. You'll be left with the most stunning, long-lasting lip color. You can stop there, or you can apply lip gloss over the top. I prefer the latter. It's become my go-to lip combo. Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water I can't tell you how many makeup artists and skincare experts have recommended Bioderma's Sensibio H2O Micellar Water to me. The classic French pharmacy product quickly and easily dissolves makeup, cleansing the skin without leaving behind even a hint of redness or irritation. Bondi Sands Self Tanning Foam Behold! The only self-tanner I've used consistently for over five years—Bondi Sands' Self Tanning Foam in Dark. It doesn't streak. It doesn't smell. It also features a bronze guide color, allowing you to see exactly where you're placing it and where you need to blend. I wear it overnight, and by the next morning, I have natural-looking, sun-kissed limbs. COLOR WOW Dream Coat Supernatural Spray I've always wondered how celebrities like Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian get such glossy hair on the red carpet. Well, as it turns out, the answer is Color Wow's Dream Coat Supernatural Spray. Read my full review to learn why it's such an underrated gem. COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence Snail mucin is the ultimate glass-skin ingredient. It's moisturizing, antioxidant-rich, and anti-inflammatory, so no wonder this iconic snail mucin essence blew up on the internet. It's the key to firm, bouncy, dewy skin. Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey Clinique's Almost Lipstick in Black Honey is so good. It was *the* lipstick for '90s starlets and supermodels. Everyone from Drew Barrymore to Courteney Cox and Julia Roberts wore it in the decade of slip dresses, grunge music, and mood rings. Cut to modern day, and it's still as beloved as ever. It recently had a resurgence on TikTokafter Gen Z became aware of its sheer formula and unique and universally flattering raisin-esque color. divi Scalp Serum..."

mov_27D5CAF6F05A62CD128CE9E1F5F3E24C,2025-07-08 09:00:17,en,WEB,"  The sales on these beloved products could be gone before Prime Day is even over. Amazon Prime Day deals are here for four days this year, but that doesn't mean all your favorite products will be on sale for that full length of time. Popular products tend to sell out quickly when the discounts are this deep, so if you've had your eye on something, you don't want to miss your chance to grab it on sale. Below, we tracked down some of the most beloved products that are on sale right now — and all of these have historically sold out quickly. If you spot something on this list that you've been waiting to add to your cart, wait no more. A deal this good may not come around again for a while. Prices change quickly on Prime Day, so keep checking back to see the latest updates. Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. Stasher 10-piece reusable silicone storage bag set (40% off list price) Stasher's popular reusable storage bags can help you cut down on plastic waste (as well as the cost of buying single-use plastic bags), and we don't expect them to last long on the shelves. This 10-pack comes with bags in six different sizes, as well as four stretch lids. All are made with silicone and are safe for use in the dishwasher, freezer, microwave and oven. The TikTok-viral Meridian body hair trimmer (40% off list price) Rarely on sale for a price this low, this Meridian body hair trimmer is a viral product that may see a ton of orders this Prime Day (plenty of reviews mention first seeing it on TikTok). The trimmer can be used by both men and women, is 100% waterproof and promises a close shave without irritation, redness, ingrown hair, razor burn or bumps. It's cordless and rechargeable, and comes with an anti-nick guard to keep you safe. Cabeau TNE travel neck pillow (25% off list price) You might be familiar with Cabeau's popular neck pillows, and their TNE memory foam pillow will be on sale for Prime Day. Available in a bunch of different colors, this pillow is a must-have for flights, long train or car rides and more: It has seat straps you can attach to your chair to keep your head and neck in alignment, prevents your head from falling forward with ""head catch"" technology and is made with ergonomic memory foam. It also comes with a travel bag you can attach to your luggage. A bestselling absorbent and slip-resistant bath mat (50% off list price) An already affordable product just got an even better price. Gorilla Grip reports that their popular bath mat — which has 4.3 stars across more than 76,000 ratings — sold over 10,000 units in the past month alone, so with this half-off discount, we're expecting shoppers to flock here. Made with cozy, plush chenille, the absorbent bath mat has a textured rubber backing and is slip- and fade-resistant. It comes in so many sizes and colors, so you can match your bathroom's style and needs easily. Anua niacinamide 10 + TXA 4 serum (30% off list price) With the ongoing tariff situation potentially affecting the prices of Korean skin care and beauty products, as well as K-beauty's general popularity during Prime Day, we could see products like this Anua serum selling out. The brand reports that more than 40,000 units of the serum were bought in just the last month, too. Suitable for all skin types, the fragrance-free serum contains 10% niacinamide, as well as other skin-boosting ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramide to help your skin glow and provide hydration. The texture is described as lightweight and non-greasy, making this an easy add to any skin care routine. Lumineux teeth whitening strips (33% off list price) Yes, the ever-popular Crest 3D Whitestrips will be on sale for Prime Day (they appear elsewhere on this list), but we could also see this Lumineux alternative selling out too — it's garnered over 56,000 ratings with a 4.1-star average. These also come dentist-recommended for patients with sensitive teeth. The strips are enamel-safe and peroxide-free, relying on natural ingredients like coconut oil, lemon peel oil and more. Sol de Janeiro hair and body perfume mist (20% off list price) A constant Amazon beauty bestseller, we pretty much never see this Sol de Janeiro perfume mist on sale, so be prepared to grab it while you can. The mist comes in a ton of different scents, though the beachy, summer-ready Cheirosa '62 is probably the most well-known (it matches the viral Brazilian Bum Bum Cream scent, which also appears on this list). You can get a bottle in two sizes, including one that's travel-friendly. Blueair's newest air purifier (20% off list price) This Prime Day is the first time ever that Blueair's newest air purifier, the Blue Signature, is on sale, so you'll want to jump on this deal while you can. The purifier boasts seven stages of filtration, odor-blocking technology and an air quality indicator. You can control it using the accompanying app to set a schedule and get alerts for when the filter needs replacing. The purifier can clean up to 3,385 square feet and can even double as a table to make it multifunctional. Cocokind ceramide barrier serum (25% off list price) Another offering from a popular skin care brand, Cocokind's ceramide barrier serum can help soothe and hydrate the skin barrier using squalane and beta-glucan, as well as five ceramides. According to the brand, these ingredients can offer more hydration than hyaluronic acid, and with a comfortable, lightweight feel, the serum can layer with retinol, vitamin C and other skin care products and instantly absorb into the skin. HexClad 6-piece nonstick fry pan set (20% off list price) You're probably familiar with HexClad, the Gordon Ramsay-approved cookware brand. We could see this 6-piece set going quickly with the offered discount: It contains fry pans of three sizes (8-, 10- and 12-inch) as well as lids for each.

I have been using this for maybe three days now, and putting it on in the morning and evening are the best parts of my day.

Se você está em uma situação difícil ou desafiadora, lembre-se: você pode ser a resposta de Deus para esse tempo e esse lugar. ORAÇÂO Senhor Deus, Obrigada por me lembrar que Tu tens um propósito para cada estação da minha vida. Ajuda-me a não me calar diante daquilo que precisa ser feito. Dá-me coragem, sabedoria e fé para agir conforme a Tua vontade. Usa-me como instrumento de transformação no tempo e lugar em que me colocaste. Em nome de Jesus, amém.

Foi a segunda capital da Revolução Farroupilha, o que lhe confere um valor simbólico e patriótico forte na memória do estado. Esse passado está presente em construções como o Forte Dom Pedro II e no Museu Lanceiros do Sul, que guardam registros da luta dos farroupilhas. As celebrações da Semana Farroupilha são especialmente intensas na cidade, reunindo a população em torno de festas, desfiles, músicas e danças tradicionais que reforçam o orgulho da identidade sul-rio-grandense. Além de seu legado histórico, Caçapava do Sul se destaca por sua forte ligação com a natureza e o patrimônio geológico. A cidade é um dos polos brasileiros do geoturismo, com paisagens únicas como a Pedra do Segredo e o Cerro do Depósito, que encantam tanto turistas quanto estudiosos. Essa relação com a terra influencia também na cultura local, refletida em expressões artísticas, no modo de vida e até mesmo na culinária regional. A mistura de tradição, história e natureza faz de Caçapava do Sul um lugar onde a cultura gaúcha é vivida com autenticidade e orgulho.

It comes with 44 strips total, which is enough for 20 regular treatments and two one-hour express treatments. Check out a TikTok of the Crest 3D Whitestrips in action. Promising review: ""I haven't used Crest White Strips in over five years. Since then, my teeth have stayed really white, and I frequently get compliments or questions about how I got my teeth so white. I decided to get a box to boost the whiteness of my teeth. Wow, I was shocked at how much these have improved! Before, the strips were really flimsy, hard to remove from the package, and really hard to keep on your teeth — the old ones would slip or bunch up. These are such an improvement! The new strips remove easily from the plastic they are on. The strips are REALLY adhesive! These will not budge! Since I've purchased, I have only used them about four times, and I can already notice a difference. Other people have noticed, too. I think these are well worth the money and work as well as a professional treatment. I have had friends who have done professional treatments and their teeth are not as white as mine. I highly recommend these to anyone who wants a brighter/whiter smile!"" —Vanessa5o5 Price: $29.99 (originally $44.95) 2. A pack of Scrubbing Bubbles toilet cleaning stamps for 25% off so you can polish your toilet without ever having to pick up a dirty toilet brush. *shudders* The stamp releases the cleaning gel, which foams and cleans your toilet.

Also the scent is light but really nice and fresh! I recommend these 100%! They're super interesting but they do the job."" —Janet Price: $3.49 (regularly $4.67) 3. A 32-pack of Energizer AA batteries for 25% off because there's always something that needs a few of these.

Whether I need to restock my combination skincare routine or am looking to test a buzzy new beauty device, a great deal is always around the corner. Looks like it's true that good things come to those who wait—Amazon Prime Day is here just in time to refresh my summer beauty routine. From now through July 11, you can spot hundreds (if not thousands) of deals on Amazon in every major category, including summer shoes and vacation essentials. However, it's the sale of the year for beauty fans as top brands like Supergoop, Sol de Janeiro, Shark Beauty, Laneige, and so many more are at a major discount. To put it simply, Amazon Prime Day is not a sale you want to skip. To ensure you don't miss out on any of the incredible discounts, I'm bringing you the ultimate edit of Amazon Prime Day's best beauty deals. Ahead, uncover some of our editors' holy grail nail finds, skincare, fragrance, devices, makeup, and hair care currently on sale. Be sure to keep this page bookmarked, as the beauty deals will continue to arrive as I discover them in real-time. The Best Overall Beauty Deals at Amazon Prime Day Amazon Prime Day at a Glance Best Skincare Deals at Amazon Prime Day Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Spf 50 (Was $38) While technically this is a facial sunscreen, it doubles as a makeup primer that can be used anytime, anywhere. Katherine J. Igoe, an MC contributing editor, says, ""It goes on smoothly and feels incredibly lightweight without any of the annoyances of most sunscreens."" Katherine J. Igoe tests Supergoop! Unseen Sunscren SPF 50. (Image credit: MC Editors) Bioderma Bioderma Sensibio H2o Micellar Water (Was $14) Waterproof mascara, SPF, makeup, and dirt don't stand a chance with this French pharmacy favorite in your routine. A couple of drops on a cotton pad will remove your makeup, all while balancing pH, hydrating, and soothing skin. CeraVe Cerave Hydrating Cream to Foam Cleanser (Was $20) This cleanser is just what your skincare routine needs as a first step—it gently removes makeup and grime without drying out your skin. The cream lathers quickly into a foam, so a little bit goes a long way. Embryolisse Embryolisse Lait-Crème Concentré (Was $29) Another French beauty staple, this moisturizer will have your skin feeling baby soft and smooth in no time. It's a rich cream that deeply nourishes the skin, without feeling too heavy or leaving behind any greasiness. Kiehl's Avocado Eye Treatment (Was $38) This is one of the best eye creams for dryness, so it's not a bad idea to stock up before the fall. It uses avocado oil and caffeine to help smooth puffy eyes and fine lines and to boost radiance. Best Beauty Device Deals at Amazon Prime Day Shark Shark Hd430 Flexstyle Air Styling & Drying System (Was $350) As someone with minimal hair styling skills, the Shark FlexStyle is the only way I know how to do my hair. It's easy as can be to use, and I can create a variety of styles from big, bouncy curls to sleek blowouts. Brooke Knappenberger tests the auto-wrap curler attachments of the Shark FlexStyle.

mov_1143B5BDE1550C1E516D4F1F909C312F,2025-07-08 14:47:34,en,WEB,"  Amazon Prime Day kicks off Tuesday, July 8, and what used to be a 24-hour shopping frenzy has now evolved into a nearly week-long sales event. However, this year, the real giant faces some economic headwinds. The Wall Street Journal reports that interest in Prime Day has waned in recent years, with year-over-year growth stuck in the single digits. Shoppers are also keeping a close eye on looming tariffs from the Trump administration, which could raise prices on everyday goods in the months ahead. What are customers buying? Analysts expect consumers to focus on deeper discounts now, especially on big-ticket items like TVs. Senior analyst Zam Stambor at eMarketer said customers are “very focused on getting value where and when they can right now.” One third-party seller told the Journal that while he expects strong momentum on Day 1, interest may taper off later in the week. Still, he believes sales will outpace a typical July day. BuzzFeed highlighted top deals on items such as Stanley Quenchers, Sol de Janeiro body cream, AirPods Pro, the Philips Sonicare toothbrush and the Nespresso Vertuo Plus coffee maker. Amazon leans on AI tools To boost the shopping experience, Amazon is promoting Rufus, its relatively new AI-powered product comparison tool available in the Amazon app. While it helps customers narrow down options, some users say it still struggles to interpret more complex questions. Amazon officials hope extending Prime Day will supercharge Amazon's revenues, which already bring in more than $50 billion annually. The sales event drives major ad spending from sellers looking to outshine competitors offering similar products. The CEO of Bartesian, a cocktail machine maker, says he will use Prime Day to build brand awareness ahead of the more competitive Black Friday season. He also warned that prices may rise later this year, depending on the impact of tariffs. Prime memberships and revenue expectations Amazon is also hoping to use the event to convert more shoppers into Prime members. Current membership costs $139 per year, which includes perks such as fast shipping and TV streaming offers. According to eMarketer, Amazon is projected to bring in a record $12.9 billion in the U.S. during Prime week — a jump of more than 50% compared to last year. This year's event follows spring campaigns like Pet Day, Book Day and the Summer Beauty Haul — all part of Amazon's effort to stretch its sales calendar year-round. Jason Morrell (Morning Managing Editor), Shianne DeLeon (Video Editor), and Devin Pavlou (Digital Producer) contributed to this report."
mov_D1A74AB396EEA0E06E4CBD862F035699,2025-07-08 14:49:40,en,WEB,"  The Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumiser has been hailed a 'game-changer' for beauty buffs and it's reduced on Amazon Prime Day by 29% Bookmark Share Lucy Addicott Bookmark Beauty fans praise the Revlon hair tool for keeping their locks frizz-free in warm weather (Image: Amazon) Getting a professional blow-dry can soon start to add up but beauty fans have found a way to get a 'professional finish' at home for under £30. Revlon's One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumiser has been a viral hit, racking up more than 40,000 reviews on Amazon. At £39.99 full price it's still a lot cheaper than getting hair blown out in a salon, however, thanks to an Amazon Prime Day deal it's currently even more of a bargain on sale for £28.39. Shoppers will need to be a member of Amazon Prime to take advantage of the offer and those that are not can sign up for a free 30-day trial here. This makes the Revlon blow-dry brush cheaper at Amazon than it currently is at Boots and Argos. The clever gadget is a savvy combination of a dryer and a styling brush, designed to speed up the process of styling hair while keeping damage at bay. With a ceramic coating and ionic technology, it promises a frizz-free, smooth mane for varying hair types. It also has three heat settings, two speed options and a 'cool shot' feature to set the style firmly in place.

Skeptical shoppers have been left very pleased with the Revlon purchase, raving over how convenient it is and its ability to make hair sleek and shiny. One person wrote: ""So I wasn't expecting much from this product - but I am amazed. I sectioned my hair as instructed and away I went. It took about 10-15 minuets and my hair looks amazing (and even my husband agrees)! I could keep the tension and my hair didn't get tangled up once. I look like I just stepped out of Dry Bar. This is the best beauty purchase I have made in ages!"" Amazon Prime Sign Up Amazon Prime membership, including exclusive Prime Day discounts and perks on Hello Fresh, music, books and Prime Video. Usually £8.99 a month, you can now get a 30-day free trial to get access to the latest deals. Free Amazon While there are comments from some that the gadget could feel 'a bit heavy' over time, its 360 swivel cord aims to ease that burden. Following the buzz of the Dyson Airwrap debut in 2018, air stylers became the go-to, prompting various brands to release their versions. Dyson's Airwrap and Shark's Flexstyle both carry a price tag upwards of £200, which is why Revlon's offering is seen as a steal by beauty fans applauding it as 'much better' than pricier options. The Shark and Dyson stylers do come with lots more accessories than Revlon including a wide tooth comb and a diffuser. Another Amazon customer left a five star review saying they didn't agree that it was too heavy, writing: ""Very happy so far with this product! Not as heavy as you think and did a great job at giving me some volume and the ends of my hair a nice blow dry finish which lasted all day during warm weather."" Shoppers are getting a professional level blow dry at home (Image: Amazon) And someone else said the 'brush dryer has changed my life as it looks as if I have had a professional blow dry'. They explained: ""The Revlon One-Step Hair Dryer and Volumiser is a true game-changer for those with mid-length hair. It has simplified my hairstyling routine, delivering salon-worthy results without the salon price tag. If you're looking to upgrade your hair care routine, I highly recommend giving this product a try. It's a time-saving, hair-loving, and styling powerhouse that has earned a permanent spot in my daily routine. Say goodbye to bad hair days!"" It has also been noted that it works for 'long hair and short hair', as well as hair types including curly, afro and wavy. Calling it 'the best hairdryer for afro hair', someone wrote: ""Best hair dryer ever for afro hair. Always struggled to use a hairbrush and hold the hairdryer which always took so long normally about an hour to get the right texture this hair dryer not only do you use one hand but it really straightens the hair ready in preparation but if you wanna straighten your hair after and only takes half the time."" Another person said: ""I have naturally wavy/curly hair, (it's also bleached at the ends) and not so much thick but I just have a lot of hair so usually it takes so long to do, however after using this styler I noticed how fast it dried my hair. Usually hairdryers leave my hair feeling dry and frizzy but this styler left my hair looking 'not frizzy' and shiny."""

mov_FCD9CCFF858DFF77CA557E2040CDE28F,2025-07-08 15:19:16,en,WEB,"  As a beauty writer I'm always on the look-out for new products to add to my arsenal so while on a recent holiday to Portugal I had to know what self-tan my friend was using to achieve her gorgeous glow. The item in question turned out to be the Isle of Paradise Self-Tanning Body Drops, which come in three shades - light, medium and dark. Founded by celebrity tanning expert Jules Von Hep, several A-listers have been rumoured to use products from Isle of Paradise including Margot Robbie who was reportedly tanned using the medium self-tanning water for the Barbie Tour. The self-tanning drops would typically retail for £24.95, however, an Amazon Prime Day deal sees them reduced to £17.89. The Amazon offer beats the price shoppers will currently find them at Boots, Sephora and Cult Beauty. To take advantage of the Amazon deal, consumers must be a member of Prime and they can sign up for a free 30-day trial here. READ MORE: Amazon's £28 maxi dress 'hugs every contour' and 'feels just like' Kim Kardashian's brand READ MORE: Fragrance fans snap up £36 Sol de Janeiro tote bag set that's worth £52 Isle of Paradise's self-tanning drops are completely customisable so the user can add as many drops as they wish into their usual body moisturiser. It's a much easier way to tan the body, ensuring less risk of streaks and patchy tan. The formula is also boosted with caffeine, baobab and oat extract to help make the skin appear firmer, brighter and smoother. Shoppers say 'this is the first fake tan I've used where someone has asked me if I'd been on holiday so I'm pretty pleased with it', making it an ideal choice for the summer season. Another loyal customer wrote: ""On my third consecutive bottle. 8 drops gives a healthy skin glow. Looks great under makeup. Nice consistency, dries well and is not patchy as it comes off."" Amazon Prime Sign Up Amazon Prime membership, including exclusive Prime Day discounts and perks on Hello Fresh, music, books and Prime Video. Usually £8.99 a month, you can now get a 30-day free trial to get access to the latest deals. Free Amazon It has been noted by a few users the drops should be 'used sparingly' and one customer gave a warning, writing: ""Beware though, you do need to wash your hands thoroughly after use though otherwise you will be left with brown tide marks on your skin. I would recommend starting off gradually and then adding more as needed."" Other popular self-tanning drops include the Charlotte Tilbury Beautiful Skin Island Glow Easy Tanning Drops. They are £38 at Space NK and reviews say 'these are the most flawless tanning drop I've ever used'. However, they only come in two shades, compared the Isle of Paradise's three. Another option that is said to 'hydrate as it glows' are from Pai. The Impossible Tan Hydrating Self Tan Drops retail for £34 at LookFantastic and shoppers say they 'create a lovely natural healthy looking tan'. Customers of Isle of Paradise share before and after results (Image: Amazon) But, the most affordable option out of the above are the Isle of Paradise drops, part of the Amazon Prime Day sale. A happy customer wrote: ""I love this product - I was introduced to it in a gift set and this is me replenishing what I've already used! A couple of drops in my normal moisturiser and I have a natural glow! I keep getting comments on how well I look."" Someone else raved about how it extended their existing tan, writing: ""I bought these drops to carry on my glow from holiday. I am very fair skinned and even after two weeks in the Maldives I was barely tanned! These little drops were great for adding to that, I used two-three drops in with my nighttime moisturiser two or three times a week, that's all I needed and I got compliments from the first use. I think I looked more glowing from these than the holiday."" And a third commented: ""I love this. I first tried a sample of this and fell in love. This product lets you control the tan, I tend to go for 4 drops for a natural looking tan. I just drop the tan into my moisturiser and apply it as normal. It takes about 2-4hrs to develop."""

Most shoppers associate Amazon Prime Day with tech and household items, but the massive sale event also delivers some of the best fashion deals of the year. The retail giant is currently slashing prices on best-sellers from name brands like Ray-Ban, Levi's, and Dr. Martens, making it a great time to stock up on essentials or pull the trigger on a bigger purchase, like a Citizen watch. The only downside to Amazon's fashion deals is that there are genuinely too many of them. To help with the legwork, our shopping experts have combed through Amazon's clothing and footwear sections to find some of the best Prime Day fashion deals right now. Check them out below. The Best Amazon Prime Day Fashion Deals Below are some of the best Prime Day fashion deals, featuring discounts on a wide range of items, from sneakers to jeans and watches. Keep in mind that most Prime Day deals require a Prime membership to shop — get a 30-day free trial now if you're not already a member. Amazon PRime Free Trial Reminder: Most of these deals will be gone tomorrow, so act fast if you see something you like. Best Prime Day Shoe Deals Some of the best Prime Day fashion deals are on footwear, including sneakers from brands like Adidas and Puma, as well as boots from Dr. Martens. If you need a last-minute summer refresh (or something new ahead of winter), pick them up now at a discount.

mov_54139EE9AECA33E92523A2726E52DD42,2025-07-08 21:39:09,en,WEB,"  These deals are really good, and I simply don't think you can resist. Amazon Prime Day is here! There are more deals than you could ever begin to look through on your own...so that's where we come in. We waded through the mountains of bargains for you and found some of the best deals in every category. FYI — deals move *fast*. We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. The 2nd Gen AirPods Pro for 40% off (that's $100 off, an all-new lowest price ever!) . With active noise cancellation, spatial audio, three silicone tips for customized fit, and over 24 hours of listening time with the included case, the AirPods Pro 2 give you a *ton* of bang for your buck. Promising review: ""Holy cow. Anyone with standard AirPods should upgrade to these on the next go-around, if not sooner. These are indeed a game changer! I can hear my books/music/podcasts on the train without adjusting the volume, and even while standing on the noisy platform when trains come through. The noise cancellation is amazing. I no longer cringe when seated next to noisy people first thing in the morning. The options for total noise cancellation vs. the adaptive settings are terrific. I had avoided this style previously because I found them uncomfortable compared to the original AirPods, but with the different offered attachments, it is much easier to find the comfortable option. Highly recommend the extra money for these!"" —Rosemary Price: $149 (originally $249 (and currently $249 at Apple); typically $189.99 at Amazon) AirPods 4 are also a new lowest price ever — 34% off with noise cancellation (down to $119), 31% off without (down to $89). 2. Select colors of 40-ounce Stanley Quenchers for 40% off because if you're going to add to your collection or hop on the Emotional Support Water Bottle bandwagon, you might as well save a few bucks while you're at it. Promising review: ""I used to make fun of people for using these Stanley cups; I always thought they were overpriced and overhyped. But I purchased this for my little sister who is in nursing school, and she takes this thing with her everywhere!!! All she does is rave about how amazing it is! So I bought one as well, and they really are amazing products. Made super well, they keep ice in them for hours and hours! Super comfortable to hold in your hand, not too heavy or bulky. Easy to clean and seem to be super durable. I've dropped mine I don't even know how many times now, and not a single mark! They also don't leak easy at all. Unless you're holding it completely upside down, even then it doesn't leak fast. Super happy!"" —Jon & Katie Severs Price: $27 (originally $45; deal available on select colors, including fuchsia, plum, mist, and stargaze) and shop all the Stanley deals here 3. The *newest* Amazon 4K Fire TV Stick for 50% off — that's the best price outside of Cyber Week. It has 4K picture, Dolby sound, and ~WiFi 6~ to help with uninterrupted streaming, plus smart search so you can find a movie or TV show by actor, genre (""action movies with car chases""), or even quote! Just plug into your existing TV and stream all the shows, movies, and music you want at the push of a button. Promising review: ""I've been dealing with WebOS on my LG TV for three years now, and enough is enough. Fire TV stick is  I love this thing. I can even view my Blink cameras on the big screen now; so cool. Setup is so easy and it linked to my other Alexa-enabled devices just great. Picture is great, response is lightning quick."" —MattSR Price: $24.99 (originally $49.99) — and shop all of the Amazon device deals here...."

Promising review: ""I used to make fun of people for using these Stanley cups; I always thought they were overpriced and overhyped. But I purchased this for my little sister who is in nursing school, and she takes this thing with her everywhere!!! All she does is rave about how amazing it is! So I bought one as well, and they really are amazing products. Made super well, they keep ice in them for hours and hours! Super comfortable to hold in your hand, not too heavy or bulky. Easy to clean and seem to be super durable. I've dropped mine I don't even know how many times now, and not a single mark! They also don't leak easy at all. Unless you're holding it completely upside down, even then it doesn't leak fast. Super happy!"" —Jon & Katie Severs Price: $27 (originally $45; deal available on select colors, including fuchsia, plum, almond rose, and stargaze) and shop all the Stanley deals here 2. The Apple Watch Series 10 for 30% off (that's $120 off, an all-new lowest price ever) with 30% more screen area and improved battery life *and* a lighter, thinner design than previous models! From all sorts of fitness and health metrics to communication features (like texting and calling when your iPhone is out of reach) and even a car crash detection feature that can connect you to emergency services, it'll have your back no matter what the day throws at you. It's also swimproof with 50m water resistance too! Promising review: ""The Apple Watch Series 10 with Cellular is hands-down the best smartwatch I've ever owned. It's sleek, fast, and packed with features that make everyday life easier — from tracking workouts and heart rate to answering calls and messages without needing my phone nearby. The cellular feature gives me true freedom when I'm out running or running errands, and the improved battery life easily gets me through the day. The new health and fitness upgrades are incredibly detailed, and the always-on display is sharp and responsive. It's not just a watch — it's a powerful tool that keeps me connected, active, and on top of everything. Worth every penny!"" —Austin Price: $279 (originally $399; available in six colors) You can also get the Apple Watch SE for the best price it goes for outside of Cyber Week: $169.99 (originally $249 (currently $249 at Apple); typically $189 at Amazon) 3. 20% off Sol de Janeiro, including their Brazilian Bum Bum Cream (a deal worth replenishing for, because it *rarely* goes on sale). This is a cult-favorite body cream you're going to want to slather all over your body, thanks to the deep hydration (cupuaçu butter, coconut oil, and açai oil!) and temporary skin-tightening (caffeine!) it provides, plus a fragrance with notes of salted caramel and vanilla that reviewers L O V E. Caffeine has a number of skincare benefits, including brightening and temporarily reducing the appearance of stretch marks and cellulite, if that's something you're looking to do! You can read more about the skincare benefits of caffeine at the Cleveland Clinic. Promising review: ""OBSESSED. I can't say enough great things about this lotion. Don't hesitate, just buy"" —Summer Promising review: ""Where has this been all my life? I have been using this for maybe three days now, and putting it on in the morning and evening are the best parts of my day. The description of the scent as ""pistachio, salted caramel, and vanilla"" does not even begin to describe the incredibly decadent smell of this cream on my skin. My skin feels like velvet and I saw improvements in the texture after the first application...."

When you click on or buy through our links, we may earn a commission. Learn more. Amazon Prime Day, aka the biggest sale of the year so far, is officially here. Prime members have four days (yes, four) to shop exclusive discounts across categories, including tech, beauty, home and kitchen, plus take advantage of limited-time promotions like Lightning Deals. And while hundreds of deals are available to shop right now, they're not all worthwhile — in fact, most aren't. As shopping editors, we get an advanced preview of the deals, so I spent the past few weeks combing through discounts to find the ones I think are actually worth adding to your cart. I've covered Prime Day for the past six years and in that time, I've perfected the deal hunting process. I look for items that are: 20% off or more, highly rated from hundreds of reviews and at its lowest price in at least three months. Every single deal I recommend below meets those qualifications, and I'll update this list live throughout Prime Day as more drop. Want more from NBC Select?

Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects Crest 3D Whitestrips Professional Effects $29.99 at Amazon Out of all the teeth whitening strips we've tested, these are our favorite because they're easy to use and highly effective.

Dyson Airwrap Origin Dyson Airwrap Origin $399.99 at Amazon The Dyson Airwrap simultaneously dries and styles your hair, letting you create curly, wavy and straight styles without causing heat damage, according to Dyson. It comes with three interchangeable attachments: a smoothing dryer, round volumizing brush and long barrel. The Airwrap also has a cool shot button. Differin Acne Treatment Gel Differin Acne Treatment Gel $19.89 at Amazon Dermatologists we've talked to say Differin Gel is one of the best acne treatments. It's an over-the-counter retinoid made with 0.1% adapalene, and it works best if you apply it to your entire face once daily, according to the brand. Bissell Little Green Multi-Purpose Portable Carpet and Upholstery Cleaner The Little Green Machine helps you get stains out of upholstered furniture, carpets, area rugs, car seats and more. It has two 48-ounce tanks to separate cleaning solution from dirty liquid, and the head on the end of its long hose lets you spray cleaner on messes, scrub and suction them. You get a bottle of Bissell's Oxy Formula with your purchase, as well as a tough stain tool, self-cleaning hose tool and spraying crevice tool. Amazon Kindle Paperwhite This Kindle gives you 12 weeks of battery life on a single charge, according to the brand, and it's thin and lightweight, making it easy to travel with. It also has a 7-inch glare-free screen and an adjustable warm light so you can clearly see text in any environment. The e-reader is water-resistant, too — you can use it at the beach, by the pool or in the bath without worrying about splashes. “I'm a devoted hardcover fan, but I still can't live without my Kindle,” says NBC Select editor Lindsay Schneider, who's used a number of Kindle models over the years, courtesy testing samples from Amazon. “It really is impossible to live without once you try it. It makes it a whole lot easier to read on the go and outside. The battery is quite impressive too, I feel like I never have to charge it.”..."

The main reason that I upgraded was so that I could get noise-cancelling (I work in a loud environment where only earbuds can be used). I was at first concerned that the noise cancelling from earbuds wouldn't be nearly as strong as if they were from full-on headphones, but these are about as close as you are going to get. The inclusion of different-sized ear tips is great, as the ability to pick the size makes these much more comfortable than the regular AirPods. The case size is slightly larger than regular AirPods, but the fact that it has the internal lanyard loop will make you save space when selecting a case. The sound quality blows regular AirPods out of the water, especially with noise cancelling on, as it keeps you from having to turn up the volume in loud environments. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for their next sound upgrade.

AirPods Max are up to 27% off, which (you guessed it!) is also a lowest-ever price — they're down to $399+ (depending on the color). 49% off Y0140 iRobot Roombat Promising review: ""I love this robot. We got this because our baby is constantly on the floor, so we just wanted a little extra help with keeping the floors clean. We run it every night, and seeing how much it picks up blows our mind. We have two dogs, so dog hair and Cheerios are mainly what we get, but it has definitely made a difference with our floors on top of what we already do to keep our floors clean. Highly recommend. We have vinyl wood floors, so it runs fine on it, but it can go on carpet as well. We just leave the room doors closed because it is very loud when it runs and we don't want it to come into the rooms."" — Makayla Price: $139.99 (originally $274; also available in two other styles for a different or no discount) — and shop all the Roomba deals here 20% off Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream Caffeine has a number of skincare benefits, including brightening and temporarily reducing the appearance of stretch marks and cellulite, if that's something you're looking to do!

Featured pricing is subject to change. The scent of summer has found its way into Amazon's biggest sale of the year, and beauty lovers everywhere are buzzing. Sol de Janeiro's Brazilian Bum Bum Cream Set is one of the most talked-about Prime Day steals — and for good reason. For 20% off during Amazon Prime Day, this cult-favorite body care bundle is being scooped up by fans and first-time buyers alike (as it should be). It's not your typical moisturizer, either. It's a full-blown trip to your piña-colada-sipping tropical resort. In short, it's an experience, wrapped in a golden jar and sealed with buttery bliss. For those unfamiliar with the phenomenon, Brazilian Bum Bum Cream is a rich, fast-absorbing body moisturizer powered by guaraná extract — an Amazonian plant packed with caffeine. After reviewing practically the entire brand, I can attest that this holy-grail item is worth the hype. The formula also features cupuaçu butter and coconut oil, ingredients known for their skin-softening properties. But beyond the hydration benefits, it's the fragrance that turns first-time users into lifelong devotees: warm pistachio, salted caramel and vanilla notes linger on the skin for hours, making it as much a perfume as a lotion. Prime Day kicked off on July 8 and lasts until July 11, and this set is definitely one of the best Prime Day beauty deals offered right now. The celebrity seal of approval has only fueled the frenzy. Blake Lively, Selena Gomez and Hailey Bieber are among the high-profile names who've made this cream a mainstay in their skincare routines. The set being offered on Amazon includes not only the standard-size cream but also travel-friendly companions that enhance the fragrance and hydration experience. So yes, I'll be shopping this two-piece set and be taking the graceful mini on my Hawaiian honeymoon this September. Layering the cream with its matching body mist or shower gel intensifies the signature Cheirosa '62 scent and makes the daily routine feel like a spa-worthy escape. If you love indulgent scents, smooth skin, and that golden-hour glow, this is your moment. While it's 20% off, I can say with full certainty that this twin pack is the most dynamic duo Prime Day has to offer. Use promo code NYPOSTAB10 to save 10% on top of Prime Day deals.

You work hard, so you deserve nice things. And if you don't work hard, well, who am I to judge? Everyone's earned a lil' treat, in my humble opinion. Whether it's a completely unnecessary bottle of hand sanitizer you impulse-buy at checkout (despite having a personal stockpile rattling around in your bag) or a quick online shopping break during work hours just to feel something, I fully support it. A “lil' treat” can be anything, really. It's how we cope in the modern world (have you seen the news?) . And right now, thanks to Amazon's Prime Day Sale, you can snag some delightfully unnecessary-but-deeply-satisfying goodies for $50 or less. SOL DE JANEIRO Rio Trio Body Cream Set $26.60 $38.00 30% off Buy Now On Amazon We're talking about the viral Jisulife handheld mini fan that might literally save you from melting this summer, or the iconic Stanley tumbler that everyone seems to have. There's also the Sol de Janeiro hair mist and body spray, which smells like a beach vacation, and a silky Kitsch satin pillowcase that promises to help protect your hair — all discounted and mostly priced between $10 and $30. LANEIGE Lip Sleeping Mask $16.80 $24.00 30% off Buy Now On Amazon But let's be clear: a lil' treat (noun) is not limited to what's on this list. It just needs to be something that makes you feel happy. If hitting “Place Order” gives you a dopamine rush, if unboxing something pretty makes you forget your favorite band just announced a breakup, or if it simply helps you get through Tuesday, then yes, it counts. So go ahead. Shop our must-buy lil' treats during Amazon Prime Day (running through July 11, 2025). And if you're in the mood to splurge a bit more, check out our full guide to shopping editor-approved faves.

Lawless's ""Forget The Filler"" in a variety of delectable flavors (birthday cake!!!) — it'll hydrate your lips overnight (similar to Laneige's repairing sleep mask) and make your pout fuller. It's made of shea butter, hyaluronic acid, and a stimulating peptide complex that work so magically together you won't ever want to run out. Promising review: ""Really makes a difference. First overnight treatment I've used where my lips genuinely feel hydrated and plumper in the morning. I'm pleasantly surprised — I bought this on a whim after a rec from The Strategist and almost canceled the order. Now I use it every night!"" —Hilary Get it from Amazon $22 (available in five flavors). 2. Clinique Almost Lipstick Tinted Lip Balm in Black Honey that has been *all the rage* on TikTok (which is how you know it's good). It's lightweight, has a touch of gloss to it, and the shade will have you saying ""mhmmmm, honey!"" from the second you apply it. BuzzFeed writer Emma Lord has personally tested this baby out. She said: ""I was very adamant about not buying this for the longest time because I am stubborn about ""expensive"" beauty products, but this is worth every penny and then some. It's so lightweight and layerable, it's foolproof to apply, and I have yet to wear a single outfit it doesn't complement??? I love watching it instantly elevate a casual look or add simple elegance to dressy ones. I wear it every day now, and after weeks of use, I've barely made a dent. Also, and maybe this is just me, but I tend to get pigment on my teeth with a lot of lip products, and I've simply never had an issue with this magic stick. Anyway, watch this TikTok of someone using it on their lips AND cheeks, because I did and oops, this lipstick FELL into my cart."" Get it from Amazon for $25 (available in two shades). 3. Sol De Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream featuring scent notes of vanilla, pistachio, and salted caramel you'll enjoy applying to your skin just as much as you'd like it as an ice cream sundae. It's also filled with vitamin E, caffeine, coconut oil, and guarana extract to help smooth, firm, and hydrate your skin. BuzzFeed editor Elizabeth Lilly says, ""I've used this stuff before and can confirm that 1) the scent is indeed intoxicating and 2) everything from this brand has scents that really STICK to you. I'm currently using the Beija Flor body wash and I can smell it on my skin hours later — which is pretty rare for a body wash."" Promising review: ""I am 60 and I could not get rid of the cellulite on my legs. I started using this product six weeks ago and can noticeably see a difference. I apply morning and evening, before bed for optimal results. It goes on smooth and has a creamy, nonsticky feel. The smell is dreamy, and even my husband has commented on the improvement. Make sure you apply in a circular motion for optimal coverage, absorption and circulation."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24 (available in three sizes and in packs). 4. A motivating daily planner that literally says ""You've got this!"" at the top — it'll also look oh-so-cute on your desk or fridge and has sections to keep track of appointments, how much water you're drinking, a to-do list, what you ate (meal prep, perhaps?!) and a general notes/doodling area. Each pad comes with 50 sheets. Promising review: ""I use this first thing when I get in the office in the mornings as a 'personal to-do' before our morning meetings. It reminds me to stay productive when I might not have work to do in the office at that moment, but it also reminds me throughout the day of the intention I set early on. It's been a great visual reminder of my personal goals while I'm achieving professional goals."" —Chelsea Ashton Get it from Amazon for $5.99+ (available in five sizes and 17 styles). 5. Gradient tempered glass for your iPhone — it'll act as a privacy screen (sorry to the Nosy Nancy sitting next to you on the subway, they won't be able to see your texts to your mom), will help filter blue light, prevent your screen from scratching, and add a little bit of *~flair~* to your phone in the process. Psst: Read more about the effects of blue light and eye strain at UC Davis Health and the American Academy of Ophthalmology...."

Promising review: ""I recently got accepted into school and didn't want a laptop — I wanted something that could do what a laptop does and more. Fresh out of the box, the iPad is a PURE BEAUTY! It came in great condition, no visual damage from shopping. The iPad last all day long! I play games, watch movies, do homework, FaceTime my friends, and more — and about time i'm done with that my iPad is still charged! The battery is long-lasting and very strong! The iPad A-16 chip works very fast and processes everything I do very quickly! This iPad definitely exceeded my expectations!"" —Thee Baddie Price: $279 for the 128GB model (originally $349; available in four colors) 2. 40% off (that's $100 off, an all-new lowest price ever!) the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro. With active noise cancellation, spatial audio, three silicone tips for customized fit, and over 24 hours of listening time with the included case, the AirPods Pro 2 give you a *ton* of bang for your buck. Promising review: ""I upgraded to these from AirPods Gen 3, and while it was not entirely necessary, these are AWESOME!! The main reason that I upgraded was so that I could get noise-cancelling (I work in a loud environment where only earbuds can be used). I was at first concerned that the noise cancelling from earbuds wouldn't be nearly as strong as if they were from full-on headphones, but these are about as close as you are going to get. The inclusion of different-sized ear tips is great, as the ability to pick the size makes these much more comfortable than the regular AirPods. The case size is slightly larger than regular AirPods, but the fact that it has the internal lanyard loop will make you save space when selecting a case. The sound quality blows regular AirPods out of the water, especially with noise cancelling on, as it keeps you from having to turn up the volume in loud environments. I would definitely recommend these to anyone looking for their next sound upgrade. "" —Ch_Sail23 Price: $149 (originally $249 (and currently $249 at Apple); typically $189.99 at Amazon) — and shop all the Apple deals here AirPods 4 are also a new lowest price ever — 34% off with noise cancellation (down to $119), 31% off without (down to $89). AirPods Max are 22% off, they're down to $429 (depending on the color). 3. 50% off a Shark robot vacuum — an affordable but powerful machine with a self-emptying base, HEPA filtration, and 360-degree home mapping tech so it *won't* repeatedly run into the leg of your coffee table or get stuck under your couch. And the self-cleaning brushroll?? Genius! Promising review: ""If I could give this vacuum 10 stars I would!!! I have four dogs and a long haired cat. My house always felt dirty and hair was always everywhere. I dreaded vacuuming because I would have to repeat areas so much, it took forever!! I bought this months ago but for reasons I won't go into I just started using it a week ago. I ran it 3 times for the first few days and every time it picked up sooooo much!! I've been running it two to three times a day for a week now. I did not map anything because I am changing the room soon and will map it then. But just going on its own it gets everywhere thoroughly!..."

Why trust us? These are the best deals in the summer sales We're almost reaching the end of Amazon Prime Day, with the deals set to wrap up tomorrow (11 July) at midnight. In a bid to compete with the online giant, many retailers have launched their own sales with reductions that match or even beat Amazon's sale. From Currys and John Lewis to Boots and Lakeland, there are plenty of big-name retailers offering deals right now. If you're not a Prime member or want to snap up some offers this weekend, once the sale has ended, you can use this page as your ultimate guide to the best summer sales. Plus, unlike with Prime Day, you don't have to be a member to shop these sales. If none of Amazon's Prime Day discounts grab your attention, or an item on your wishlist hasn't been included in the sale, you can check this page for the latest deals on our tried-and-tested favourites from rival retailers. Currys has slashed the price of thousands of its appliances and electricals, with savings on Shark, Samsung, Dyson and more. In most cases, competing retailers are price-matching Currys, but if you notice popular products dropping out of stock in other summer sales, head to Currys to check if it has them in stock. These are some of the best deals in the Currys sale: Shark FlexBreeze HydroGo misting fan: Was £129.99, now £99.99, Currys.co.uk Breville one-touch coffeehouse coffee machine: Was £349.99, now £169.99, Currys.co.uk Shark flexbreeze hydrogo misting fan: Was £129.99, now £99.99, Currys.co.uk Much like Amazon, Currys slashed the price of this portable Shark fan to £99 back in June, just in time for the arrival of an early summer heatwave. The original FlexBreeze was named best cordless fan, and this version emits a fine mist thanks to a 150ml water tank. Our reviewer wrote that the original FlexBreeze did a “great job of cooling the air to each side of the unit as well as directly in front of it”, so you can expect the same cooling relief from this tabletop model. Stock is sparse on Amazon, so it's worth checking Currys if the colour that you want isn't available. Breville one-touch coffeehouse coffee machine: Was £349.99, now £169.99, Currys.co.uk If your morning coffee is an oat flat white, you'll want to take a look at this deal on our best coffee machine for vegan milks. Our appliances expert, Zoe Phillimore, praised this feature and said, “You can tweak how much foam and steamed milk is added to your coffee”. Plus, you can store the detachable milk container in the fridge to keep it cool. Right now at Currys, there's a chunky £180 off. John Lewis often price matches Amazon's Prime Day deals, so it's worth checking out its offering to see if you can get a longer warranty or free delivery. These are some of the best deals in the John Lewis sale: Dyson supersonic straight and wavy hair dryer: Was £329.99, now £279.99, Johnlewis.com Estee Lauder advanced night repair skincare gift set: Was £69, now £48, Johnlewis.com Ninja dual zone air fryer: Was £229.99, now £151.05, Johnlewis.com Dyson supersonic straight and wavy hair dryer: Was £329.99, now £279.99, Johnlewis.com I've spotted a few of our IndyBest favourites from Dyson in the Prime Day sale, including £80 off the airwrap. You won't find the supersonic hair dryer in Amazon's deals, but you can save £50 when you buy it from John Lewis. This model doesn't come with the full range of attachments, but there is a concentrator nozzle and flyaway attachment included. We've reviewed various iterations of the supersonic hair dryer over the years, including the supersonic nural and supersonic r, and they always receive rave reviews from our testers. Estee Lauder advanced night repair skincare gift set: Was £69, now £48, Johnlewis.com The set includes a full-sized bottle of Estee Lauder's much-loved advanced night repair serum – if you buy this alone, it'll set you back around £50. This set costs around the same but includes a moisturiser and eye cream, so you're really getting your money's worth. The advanced night repair serum made it into our round-up of the best anti-ageing serums. Beauty journalist, Jane Druker, says that it “helps to visibly soften, smooth and plump” thanks to the addition of skin-quenching hyaluronic acid. Ninja dual zone air fryer: Was £229.99, now £151.05, Johnlewis.com The Ninja dual zone air fryer has been a popular buy this Amazon Prime Day, and now John Lewis has matched the online retailer's price. This gives you more options to save if you notice it dropping out of stock at either store. Our reviewer was impressed with the variety of settings on this two-drawer air fryer and said “that it takes much of the guesswork out of timing and temperature, making mealtime feel less like a chore”. Boots has launched its summer sale with thousands of offers on beauty electricals, skincare, haircare and more. You've got five more days to shop the sale, so there'll be plenty of discounts to snap up once Amazon Prime Day is done and dusted. These are the best Boots deals now: Philips lumea 8000 series: Was £509.99, now £349.99, Boots.com Shark cryoglow under eye cooling and LED face mask: Was £299.99, now £265, Boots.com Sol de Janeiro limited edition cheirosa hair & body perfume mist set: Was £38, now £26.60, Boots.com..."

mov_E9341563588A2F77AF5CA430D6A324C5,2025-07-11 08:00:00,en,WEB,"  Depending on how similar the items are, and the rights a company holds, dupes may or may not cross legal lines To customers, a lookalike to Ugg's Tasman slippers or a knock-off of Lululemon's ultra-popular Define jacket can be a fantastic bargain. But to the companies that make the original products, similar-but-cheaper items can be bad for business. While knock-offs are nothing new, dupes — short for ""duplicate"" — have exploded in popularity in recent years. And for many younger buyers, buying an imitation is no longer something to hide. ""A lot of the consumers that we're seeing on social media, on TikTok, are so proudly displaying the dupes that they found, kind of as a badge of honour. That stigma really isn't there anymore,"" said Julie Zerbo, editor-in-chief of fashion publication The Fashion Law. The rise of dupes has also brought a corresponding wave of lawsuits from companies, saying copies of their products shouldn't be allowed to exist. American Eagle, Sol de Janeiro, Benefit Cosmetics, Deckers Brands (Ugg's parent company) and Supergoop are just a few of the fashion and beauty companies on that list. Vancouver-based Lululemon became a recent entrant when it sued Costco late last month over three products it said were knock-offs of its clothing. But are they actually illegal? Intellectual property experts say it really depends on the rights a company has over a product, and whether customers can tell the difference between the original and its copycat. When do dupes cross the line? The term ""dupe"" itself has been appearing more in legal filings, says Alexandra Roberts, law and media professor at Northeastern University — including in Lululemon's against Costco. That could partially be because their appeal has grown among online shoppers. ""Where in previous years, a company might have just said, 'Oh, this looks to us like trademark infringement,' here, [brands] are kind of building a case around the idea of [a] dupe,"" Roberts said. ""The fact that something is perceived as a dupe ... that all works its way into the allegations."" WATCH | Trying to beat online fashion copies: Trying to beat online fashion copies 8 months agoDuration 2:25 Loren Mallett, an intellectual property lawyer in Vancouver, says any case where a company says it's been copied largely depends on the rights it has over its product. Patents, industrial designs and trademarks can all protect certain parts of an item — but a company has to formally register elements like its logo or packaging design. If it hasn't, it's probably out of luck, Mallett says. And even if it has, it still might be OK to sell something really similar. The legality of a dupe depends on whether customers could be confused by the two items and think they are the exact same, Roberts says. In Lululemon's case, for example, the question might be whether buyers of the Costco sweatshirt thought they were purchasing Lululemon's Scuba hoodie, Roberts says. She says people tend to like dupes specifically because they aren't the real deal, but a cheaper alternative. And for that reason, she says, many may not be successfully litigated against. LISTEN | Dupe culture: Why Gen Z is embracing fakes: While we don't necessarily think of them as dupes, generic brands — think Life brand products sold at Shoppers Drug Mart, or Walmart's Great Value — have occupied this space for a long time, Roberts says. And historically, courts have allowed them because customers understand that one is meant to be a cheaper alternative to the other. Mallett adds that the conversation around dupes could impact companies like Lululemon in court, as many customers have said online that some of Costco's products look just like Lululemon's. The athleisure company will likely argue this as evidence that Costco wanted to pass off its product as a Lululemon item — whereas Costco will likely say it is proof the customer knew for a fact they were buying a similar-looking alternative at a lower price, according to Mallett. A case study Zerbo says many dupe-related cases are still making their way through courts. But there are some resolved ones where the lookalike has come out on top. She points to a recent conflict in the U.S. between Steve Madden and Ganni as a good example. Danish footwear brand Ganni sent cease-and-desist letters to some companies that sold certain Steve Madden shoes, saying they looked too similar to its own buckle ballerina flats and two-strap sandals. But Steve Madden turned around and sued Ganni, saying it had no right to tell those retailers they couldn't sell the similar Steve Madden shoes, because there was ""nothing new or original"" about a shoe made of leather and that has straps, eyelets and buckles — common elements in lots of footwear. Ganni ultimately walked back its original legal threats, Zerbo said, and even agreed not to sue in the future over the shoe designs. (Ganni was more successful in its home country of Denmark, however.) Zerbo says these cases show how courts generally don't want monopolies, and try to prevent giving a brand that kind of power. ""That would be bad for competition, that would be bad for consumers, prices would go through the roof."" What does that mean for my dupes? Zerbo says duping is unlikely to slow down anytime soon, as many shoppers love a good deal. She says history is full of copycat designs, which have largely been allowed to exist. Take fast fashion, for example. Companies like H&M and Forever 21 became giants mainly by replicating runway elements for a cheaper price. ""It's such a big market. There's so much consumer demand for dupes that companies would be hard pressed to stop trying to make them.""..."

mov_270B1673215351001A05D4F437169F66,2025-07-11 08:55:43,en,WEB,"  We're almost reaching the end of Amazon Prime Day, with the deals set to wrap up tomorrow (11 July) at midnight. In a bid to compete with the online giant, many retailers have launched their own sales with reductions that match or even beat Amazon's sale. From Currys and John Lewis to Boots and Lakeland, there are plenty of big-name retailers offering deals right now. If you're not a Prime member or want to snap up some offers this weekend, once the sale has ended, you can use this page as your ultimate guide to the best summer sales. Plus, unlike with Prime Day, you don't have to be a member to shop these sales. If none of Amazon's Prime Day discounts grab your attention, or an item on your wishlist hasn't been included in the sale, you can check this page for the latest deals on our tried-and-tested favourites from rival retailers. Currys: up to 30 per cent off, Currys has slashed the price of thousands of its appliances and electricals, with savings on Shark, Samsung, Dyson and more. In most cases, competing retailers are price-matching Currys, but if you notice popular products dropping out of stock in other summer sales, head to Currys to check if it has them in stock. These are some of the best deals in the Currys sale: Shark FlexBreeze HydroGo misting fan: Was £129.99, now £99.99, Currys.co.ukBreville one-touch coffeehouse coffee machine: Was £349.99, now £169.99, Currys.co.uk Shark flexbreeze hydrogo misting fan: Was £129.99, now £99.99, Much like Amazon, Currys slashed the price of this portable Shark fan to £99 back in June, just in time for the arrival of an early summer heatwave. The original FlexBreeze was named best cordless fan, and this version emits a fine mist thanks to a 150ml water tank. Our reviewer wrote that the original FlexBreeze did a “great job of cooling the air to each side of the unit as well as directly in front of it”, so you can expect the same cooling relief from this tabletop model. Stock is sparse on Amazon, so it's worth checking Currys if the colour that you want isn't available. Breville one-touch coffeehouse coffee machine: Was £349.99, now £169.99, If your morning coffee is an oat flat white, you'll want to take a look at this deal on our best coffee machine for vegan milks. Our appliances expert, Zoe Phillimore, praised this feature and said, “You can tweak how much foam and steamed milk is added to your coffee”. Plus, you can store the detachable milk container in the fridge to keep it cool. Right now at Currys, there's a chunky £180 off. John Lewis: up to 50 per cent off, John Lewis often price matches Amazon's Prime Day deals, so it's worth checking out its offering to see if you can get a longer warranty or free delivery. These are some of the best deals in the John Lewis sale: Dyson supersonic straight and wavy hair dryer: Was £329.99, now £279.99, Johnlewis.comEstee Lauder advanced night repair skincare gift set: Was £69, now £48, Johnlewis.comNinja dual zone air fryer: Was £229.99, now £151.05, Johnlewis.com Dyson supersonic straight and wavy hair dryer: Was £329.99, now £279.99, I've spotted a few of our IndyBest favourites from Dyson in the Prime Day sale, including £80 off the airwrap. You won't find the supersonic hair dryer in Amazon's deals, but you can save £50 when you buy it from John Lewis. This model doesn't come with the full range of attachments, but there is a concentrator nozzle and flyaway attachment included. We've reviewed various iterations of the supersonic hair dryer over the years, including the supersonic nural and supersonic r, and they always receive rave reviews from our testers. Estee Lauder advanced night repair skincare gift set: Was £69, now £48, The set includes a full-sized bottle of Estee Lauder's much-loved advanced night repair serum – if you buy this alone, it'll set you back around £50. This set costs around the same but includes a moisturiser and eye cream, so you're really getting your money's worth. The advanced night repair serum made it into our round-up of the best anti-ageing serums. Beauty journalist, Jane Druker, says that it “helps to visibly soften, smooth and plump” thanks to the addition of skin-quenching hyaluronic acid. Ninja dual zone air fryer: Was £229.99, now £151.05, The Ninja dual zone air fryer has been a popular buy this Amazon Prime Day, and now John Lewis has matched the online retailer's price. This gives you more options to save if you notice it dropping out of stock at either store. Our reviewer was impressed with the variety of settings on this two-drawer air fryer and said “that it takes much of the guesswork out of timing and temperature, making mealtime feel less like a chore”. Boots: up to 60 per cent off, Boots has launched its summer sale with thousands of offers on beauty electricals, skincare, haircare and more. You've got five more days to shop the sale, so there'll be plenty of discounts to snap up once Amazon Prime Day is done and dusted. These are the best Boots deals now: Philips lumea 8000 series: Was £509.99, now £349.99, Boots.comShark cryoglow under eye cooling and LED face mask: Was £299.99, now £265, Boots.comSol de Janeiro limited edition cheirosa hair & body perfume mist set: Was £38, now £26.60, Boots.com Philips lumea 8000 series: Was £509.99, now £349.99, Philips' lumea IPL range is one of our favourites for hair removal, so we're pleased to see the price of older models, such as the lumea 8000, slowly going down in price. Beauty editor Lucy Partington was impressed with the results after using this IPL machine, with “hair becoming sparser after just four treatments”. Right now, there's £160 off at Boots in its super savings week sale. Shark cryoglow under eye cooling and LED face mask: Was £299.99, now £265, Boots is one of the many retailers that have reduced the price of the viral Shark LED face mask. Amazon still has the best offer, but if you're not a Prime member or you've got advantage card points to spend, you can save with this offer. Senior shopping writer Daisy Lester was left “seriously impressed” after testing the Shark cryoglow mask for eight weeks. Its 'blemish repair' mode was her favourite setting, leaving her skin's texture and appearance “significantly improved”. Sol de Janeiro limited edition cheirosa hair & body perfume mist set: Was £38, now £26.60, Here's the perfect chance to sample Sol de Janeiro's popular perfume mists, with four bottles of its much-loved scents for £26.60, working out at £6.65 per 30ml bottle. The set includes Brazilian crush, which is a personal favourite with notes of salted caramel and pistachio, as well as delícia drench, which beauty writer Lauren Cunningham says smells like “holiday in a bottle”. Lakeland: up to 50 per cent off, If you want to upgrade your al fresco dining set-up, Lakeland has some great offers on outdoor cooking appliances and fun summer buys, such as ice cream makers. Here are some of our favourite deals in the Lakeland sale:..."

There are more deals than you could ever begin to look through on your own...so that's where we come in. We waded through the mountains of bargains for you and found some of the best deals in every category. FYI — deals move *fast*. We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. 22% off (a new lowest price ever) the newest version of the Kindle Paperwhite — it has 25% faster page turns (!!) , higher contrast ratio, and a glare-free 7-inch display. Plus all the features of the previous version, like a warm light setting for late-night reading and waterproof rating for worry-free poolside or beach reading. I've been using my Kindle Paperwhite (a previous generation) before bed for years — and after reading for a while, I turn down the brightness to a low level just slightly dimmer than I'd want — after a page or two, my brain goes ""Nope!"" and shuts off to sleep. AND it helps me not even start thinking the anxious or negative thoughts that *usually* keep me up at night. I got to upgrade to this new Kindle Paperwhite a few months ago, and the warm light feature is a game-changer. And the page turns and responsiveness of this model are indeed faster — and I can really tell the difference compared to my old Kindle! Promising review: ""I can't say enough good things about my Kindle Paperwhite — it's truly a reader's dream! The screen is crisp and easy on the eyes, even in bright sunlight or total darkness, thanks to the adjustable backlight. No glare, no straining —just pure reading bliss. The lightweight design makes it super comfortable to hold, even for long reading sessions. Plus, the battery life is incredible — I can go weeks without needing to charge it! It's also waterproof, which means I can finally read by the pool or in the bath without worrying. One of my favorite features is how easy it is to carry an entire library with me wherever I go. Whether I'm traveling, commuting, or just relaxing at home, I always have something great to read at my fingertips. If you're on the fence about getting one—do it. The Kindle Paperwhite is sleek, powerful, and makes reading more convenient and enjoyable than ever. I'm completely obsessed with mine! "" —Amber Goddard Price: $124.99 (originally $159.99) — and shop all the Kindle deals here 2. 34% off the TikTok-famous Bissell Little Green carpet and upholstery cleaner that sprays on water and stain-fighting cleaner, then sucks it away to blast away years' of mess — on carpet *and* furniture. Reviewers love it for banishing pet stains, spills, and more — without having to waste a lot of their valuable storage space. Promising review: ""Yup, saw it on TikTok and had to buy it. My car's upholstery was so dirty from my dogs and years of NOT getting it deep cleaned. This is a game changer. I should've taken a before and after because it was awesome. Not to mention how satisfying it is seeing the dirty water get sucked back into the tank. Easy to prep. Easy to use. Easy to clean. I definitely recommend. This will be perfect for other things in the house as well because if it can tackle MY car with two big dogs, it's gold."" —Taylor L. Price: $81.99 (typically $123.59; if you see a ""regular"" price of $105.99, it's from a third-party seller, not from Bissell/Amazon) — and shop all the Bissell deals here 3. 45% off a Philips Sonicare toothbrush (the cheapest it typically goes for) with all the bells and whistles you know and love: the two-minute QuadPacer timer so you make sure you're brushing all areas of the mouth effectively, a pressure sensor to prevent over-brushing, and different cleaning modes (gum care, whitening, etc!) . Aaaand a charging travel case! I have this toothbrush and love it!..."

The 'Instant Face Lift' cream for smoothing mature skin (44% off) We write quite a bit about mature skincare here at HuffPost, so when we spot a highly-rated firming lotion that's new to us and at a great price, we have to share. Enter: this “Instant Facelift” cream made with retinol, collagen and hyaluronic acid. From the brand Snfajohe, it's currently 44% off. Reviewers say it's a fast-absorbing, lightweight formula that brings fairly quick tightening and glowing results. Celebrated for not being greasy or sticky, the cream helps make skin softer and smoother. Reviewers are literally singing this formula's praises. “From the first application, I noticed my skin looking firmer and more hydrated,” one review wrote. ” ...I've tried many anti-aging creams, but this one truly stands out. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a real difference in their skincare routine!” A sporty-cool polo shirt for beating sunshine, heat and sweat (up to 57% off list price) Freshly marked down up to 57% off (depending on color and size, of course), this Adidas polo shirt is the ultimate summer-ready top. For one, it sports (heh) the brand's Climacool technology, which claims to keep you dry and cool in hot weather. This top is meant for tennis, so it has split seams for extra mobility and ventilated fabric that also wicks moisture, but who says you can't wear it on a casual weekend out? Grab it in men's sizes XS-XXL in one of four colors. The Pink Stuff bundle (15% off) The Pink Stuff is a longtime fan favorite around here for it's ability to clean seemingly anything. This six-piece bundle gives you the classic paste, a multi-purpose spray, a bathroom foam spray and three sponges. Promising review: ""Love it !!!! My stove is so clean from the paste. Smells good. Sprayed and foamed up and cleaned my toilets and showers. Shower shined."" — Kayla Chewable tablets for Fido's itchy, itchy allergies (36% off list price) Even dogs hate seasonal allergies, so if you find Fido sneezing, scratching and paw-licking a little more than usual, consider grabbing this pack of soft chews while it's 36% off for Prime Day. This 180-chew jar is loaded with colostrum, licorice and ginger root and omega 3 to relieve seasonal allergies and beautify that skin and coat. It's also peanut butter flavored, so he'll have zero idea it's to help with those flakes. Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum cream (20% off list price) The Sol de Janeiro Bum Bum cream catapulted to cult status several years ago for its custardy and nourishing formula and a lasting fragrance that's gourmand, nutty and ultra-cozy. It's made with caffeine-rich guarana to help visibly smooth and tighten skin while cupuacu butter delivers deep hydration. Kindle E-Readers back on sale for the first time since 2024! (23% off) You read that right! This well-rated Kindle e-reader hasn't been marked down since the holiday season of LAST YEAR, so you'll wanna move on this quickly. It's also on a BOGO $20 off deal if you clip the on-page coupon before adding to your cart!

E está provado por Tribunal que os Anjos se surpreenderam com o Humor da Joana sobre eles. A nós cidadãos, nem dei por esse vídeo, nem o tenciono ver. Surpreendeu - me o Acne! Tenho tenho uma irmã, foi Professora, uma pele linda de pêssego, todos nós, mas a dela era rosada e a mais bonita. Por volta dos 50 anos teve uma espécie de”alergia” na pele e foi ao Dr. Pereira Coutinho, então Director dermatologista do Hospital Santa Maria. Ele tratou-a 1 ano. Foi stress da vida, tinha uma água francesa para borrifar a pele, uns produtos para a cara farmacêuticos, ficou a partir daí alérgica a camarão e mais sensível. Sofreu muito, uma obsessão, e depois de 1 ano passou. Embora tenha alguns cuidados com a pele o borrifar- se na praia com essa água francesa spray e não lavar a cara com água da torneira. Mas trabalhou e na Escola publica não é fácil. E fez mais de 40 anos. A minha filha, foi estudar para Lisboa tinha acabado de fazer 18 anos, e para um Ap. divido. Nunca tinha feito nada (na Madeira há empregadas baratas), e não estava habituada ao frio, ao Técnico, a fazer a sua vida toda desde comida roupa, compras. Aluna de exceção mas claro muito sacrifício e noites e fins de semana na biblioteca. Nem a casa podia vir um fim de semana ou Natal, pois tinha exames em 2 janeiro e as condições climatéricas não deixam os aviões descolarem, então no Inverno. Ficou com os dedos das mãos dobrados e não os conseguia mexer nem no computador. Deram um nome de um médico: cortisona SOS e má circulação com o frio, e não tinha dinheiro para aquecedores. Mandei- lhe o carro para ir para a NOVA SBE de Carcavelos entrava ás 8 h e mestrados e saia já não havia metro e melhorou. A pele dela linda, branca e seda de loiro e olhos verdes, aqui sempre dourada pois é surfista. Em Lisboa passa a vida em dermatologistas. Claro que noto, está tudo bem e trabalha, vai ao ginásio, supermercado, talho, frutaria. Faz jantar e marmita. Passei o cão ás 7.15 da manhã e à noite. Eu noto quando cá vem tem rosácea e complexos e cremes dermatológicos do stress que diz que está tudo bem. Mas nem um domingo para almoçar nos pais. O namorado também é madeirense. Vem cá e ao Porto Santo passa tudo. Foi muita coisa e fazer tudo direitinho e estudar para dispensar e trabalhos de grupo e mestrados e trabalho e casa, para quem nunca teve que fazer nada e nem um familiar para um feriado ou Páscoa. A Culpa foi do Técnico…!? Ou da Joana Marques. Conclusão depois de 11 anos, já compraram casa cá, os dois e constituir família assim, prefere ganhar menos e viver cá. O sol é todo o ano. As amigas desde a creche, a família. E a pele irá voltar ao normal. Quando cá cheguei à 40 anos, casei, trabalhei, engravidei, não tinha carro. Não tinha ninguém. E 2 anos depois tive Lúpus e fui internada nem sabia o que era. O stress que eu também dizia que estava tudo bem, e estava, vamos aguentando por dentro e o médico de Lisboa, não é hereditário pode ter sido stress. E até ao fim da vida! Vou pedir indemnização a quem . Na altura, esta terra era tão atrasada trataram-me como se tivesse SIDA."

A Laura Mercier translucent loose setting powder, the OG powder we all know and love that'll soften pores, set makeup, and control shine like a pro. Laura put her foot in this one (and a sprinkle of witchcraft). Promising review: ""This is worth the hype. I use it primarily under my eyes on top of my concealer. It makes the concealer last a lot longer and allows the concealer and CC cream to just blend right in. I've used other setting powders, and they are trash compared to this. Also, a little goes a looooong way. Buy it, you won't be disappointed."" —Janelli Price: $43 (available in four shades) 2. Eos Shea Butter lotion that is oh so beloved by TikTok. And rightfully so — this stuff smells too good to be true. It's lightweight, will deliver a whole lotta long-lasting moisture, and will surely make its way up to the top of your favorites list. Take a peek at it on TikTok! *TikTok made me buy it* and I can confirm, it's worth the hype. Every scent I've tried smells AMAZING. Promising review: ""I bought this lotion to layer with my perfumes, and I received plenty of compliments. It also leaves my skin feeling smooth."" —Daijah Price: $12.99 (available in four scents) 3. A cleansing balm to help melt away makeup and impurities after a long day of absolutely slaying your beat face. It's hard work being a baddie, but this'll make things a bit easier. Good Molecules is a small biz that specializes in skincare products! Promising review: ""This balm really cleanses. I used a small amount and it seriously melted off my makeup, I couldn't believe it. Definitely recommend as a great first step to your nighttime routine."" —Cierra Price: $15 4. A Morphe brush set — it comes with 12 brushes picked by celebrity makeup artist Ariel (@Makeupbyariel). And by the way, Ariel beats a face DOWNNN, so you know these brushes have gotta be *a chef's kiss. * You'll get 11 different brushes and a sponge! Promising review: ""I'm in LOVE with my new set! The size selection is great. A brush for everything and then some! The texture and quality are unlike any other brush I've ever owned! I definitely recommend this set 1,000%!!!!"" —Lindsey Price: $98 5. An Anastasia Beverly Hills brow pencil with an ultra slim tip to help you get the thinnest, most *precise* hair-like strokes ever, keeping your brows looking super natural. It's dual-ended with a spoolie on the other end, so you can blend away easily. If we're choosing magic wands, I'm pickin' this one. The magic that is this product, omg. This brow pencil is my guilty pleasure...."

mov_412EE09BA5407D8806E95E9C5FAD6082,2025-07-13 22:45:15,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Como era de esperar antes de que se pusiera en marcha, el Mundial de Clubes entronizó a un equipo europeo. Pero no fue ninguno de los candidatos que estaban en la primera línea, empezando por un Paris Saint Germain que se llevó un fuerte revolcón en la final. Antes habían quedado en el camino otros pesos pesados, como Bayern Munich, Inter o Real Madrid. El sistema de clasificación había dejado afuera a Barcelona y Liverpool, dos grandes animadores de la temporada, tanto en sus ligas como en la Champions League. En medio de ese nutrido frente europeo se coló un Chelsea que llegaba en un segundo pelotón y terminó dando un paso al frente. En realidad fue un salto gigantesco, pateó el tablero internacional al golear 3-0 a Paris Saint Germain. Le alcanzó un tiempo para establecer una diferencia que le quitó cualquier misterio a la resolución de la final. Fueron tres goles en la primera etapa y un ejercicio de conservación de la ventaja en la segunda. Un partido perfecto del club londinense, que hace poco había tenido figuración internacional con la obtención de la Conference League -tercer trofeo en importancia de la UEFA- al vencer a Betis. Y había finalizado cuarto en la Premier League. El zurdazo de Palmer, en un definición muy parecida al primer gol, se convertirá en el 2-0 de Chelsea - Créditos: @Matt Slocum Y más gloria para Enzo Fernández, doble campeón del mundo, en el nivel de selección y club, y también continental, con la Copa América que festejó hace un año en suelo estadounidense. Personalidad y jerarquía futbolística componen el perfil del volante argentino. Supo pilotear la tormenta interna en el plantel que le cayó tras el Mundial, con aquel video con connotaciones discriminatorias. Su ascendencia dentro del grupo quedó a salvo, al ser designado como uno de los dos capitanes. Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad El repertorio futbolístico de Enzo es enorme. Si en la selección irrumpió con fuerza como volante central en pleno Mundial de Qatar, en Chelsea explota sus condiciones más ofensivas, sin desentenderse del repliegue para la recuperación de la pelota. En el exitoso 4-2-3-1 que dispuso Enzo Maresca para la final, Enzo ocupó posiciones adelantadas, casi en la misma línea que el centro-delantero João Pedro. Recostado preferentemente sobre la izquierda, le dio profundidad y continuidad a los ataques con asistencias que fueron estocadas para la defensa de PSG. Disputó un gran primer tiempo, fue actor principal en la sorprendente goleada por 3-0. Cansado -en ese mismo estadio había sufrido un golpe de calor en la semifinal contra Fluminense-, su rendimiento bajó un poco en el segundo período, hasta que fue reemplazado a los 15 minutos, con una molestia muscular en la pierna izquierda. Se llevó la ovación de los hinchas de Chelsea y cerró su Mundial con un gol y tres asistencias. Y agrandó su saldo favorable en finales, con siete títulos (Defensa y Justicia, River, selección argentina y Chelsea) y una derrota (Carabao Cup inglesa). El resumen de Chelsea 3 - Paris Saint Germain 0 [embedded content] La definición vino con sorpresas. Las especulaciones se desvanecieron ante la realidad que llegó desde el campo, bajo un sol que hizo subir la temperatura a más de 30 grados. El equipo que se especializa en disolver rivales con su fútbol de presión y combinaciones se vio neutralizado por un adversario que encaró la final con valentía y muy convencido de su plan. Chelsea pareció sacar fuerzas y motivación de las previsiones que lo ubicaban un escalón por debajo de un Paris Saint Germain quizá demasiado confiado de su condición de favorito. Pecó de suficiencia contra un Chelsea que se le fue al humo desde el primer minuto, dispuesto a desafiarlo, sin complejos. Como si el equipo inglés, en la preparación de la final, hubiera interiorizado la consigna “no somos menos, es nuestra oportunidad de pasar a la historia”. Con esa mentalidad, ante un PSG con muchas lagunas y lento de reacción, Chelsea se encaminó al título con un primer tiempo impecable en lo táctico y en eficacia, con un Cole Palmer estelar, autor de dos goles y una asistencia para la deliciosa definición de João Pedro en el 3-0. Enzo Fernández se esfuerza para evitar que la pelota le llegue a Vitinha - Créditos: @Seth Wenig Bajo la mirada de Donald Trump, sentado junto a un Gianni Infantino con el que últimamente lo une muchas coincidencias programáticas en cuanto al fútbol, el MetLife entregó un primer tiempo que pocos esperaban. Vecina de una Nueva York que es el ícono del espectáculo y las luminarias, Nueva Jersey también fue escenario del entretenimiento para que el Mundial tuviera un broche de alto contenido futbolístico. Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Mérito de Chelsea, que tuvo a un Palmer inspiradísimo. Su exquisita zurda ya había alertado con un remate que salió junto a un poste. Poco considerado por Guardiola en Manchester City, este hincha de Manchester United emigró a Chelsea en septiembre de 2023, por 50 millones de euros. “Puede jugar en cualquier lado, hace cosas únicas con la pelota”, lo elogió hace poco Maresca. Los incidentes del final, con la agresión de Luis Enrique a Joao Pedro - Créditos: @Pamela Smith En el Mundial, Palmer ya había jugado de diez, de extremo derecho e izquierdo. Contra PSG tuvo punto de partida sobre la derecha, desde donde quedó perfilado para dos definiciones calcadas, con zurdazos que entraron junto a la base del poste derecho de Donnarumma...."
