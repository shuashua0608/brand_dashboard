1lc5fdn,2025-06-15 17:09:28,en,REDDIT,"  I had an order from Ulta an upscale beauty care products store. Only six items. pay wasn't great, but it had been a slow morning, and I needed the batch, especially a small one, as I was working on a promotion. . My first customer had three Redken hair care products, shampoo, conditioner and some other stuff. Not a hard order, but I had to have someone go back and find the third product. The store was busy and there was a long wait. Then a long distance to the customer. When I was done with order, lo and behold the first customer with expensive hair care products didn't tip. Do I make an extra effort had I known she didn't tip? I don't know, probably. One thing is that I delivered the shampoo to military housing. A lot of times, I will offer my military customers, a Starbucks, with my rewards, in tribute to their service. But she buys expensive shampoo, and she can't tip? This is why so many customers complain about shoppers who don't care, Sometimes, we have to make an extra effort, and I feel like next time, I won't make the effort."
mxy37gj,2025-06-15 18:09:25,en,REDDIT,"  So if she had bought cheap shampoo, you'd feel differently? She still serves our country (and gets paid the same as everyone else her rank) whether she buys Suave or Biolage or Redken. Maybe she has hair issues and needs that kind in particular. Maybe she spends what money she has on hair products because, as part of her duty, she uses a lot of hair products like gel and ties her hair back in a tight bun every single day, which can cause hair thinning and loss. Doesn't mean she has more disposable income than Joe Schmoe who's the same rank as her... It just means that Joe doesn't gaf about his buzzcut hair starting to bald the same way she feels about her hair. If it was Joe ordering $100 worth of something else and not tipping, would you have posted the same thing? I feel ya on non-tippers, though. It's frustrating, especially if you go above and beyond to give good service. I just know military women and hair care can be more of a necessity than someone just trying to be bougie."

I'm looking into redken or it's a 10 but they are so expensive 😭 which I guess would be ok but my daughters also use it I really don't think I can swing multiple bottles for everyone right now,has anyone else used the 1 brands I mentioned?

However, we may receive compensation from retailers and/or from purchases of products through these links. In 2022, I declared myself over nostalgic beauty trends, worried that the aesthetic of the decade would be defined solely by references to the past (with little looking to the future). But a multicolor hair trend that's taken over my feeds has me almost regretting my words. Calico hair is a new-ish trend that may remind you of the chunky highlights of the early aughts. (Remember Kelly Clarkson's thick streaks of color?) It's aptly named for the tricolor fur of a calico cat and typically features blonde, brown, copper, red, and/or black. Hauppauge, New York-based colorist Meaghan Masterson thinks it likely took off because it's a statement comprised mostly of natural hues. While this look involves a simple palette, the uniqueness of a cat's coat inspires infinite color combinations and placements. I've seen many takes on TikTok and Instagram: Some folks opt for peekaboo patches of blonde, brown, and copper that are only revealed when you lift up the top layer of hair. Others go for bolder versions with patches or stripes of blonde, orange, and red splattered throughout their hair. I've even spotted calico-fied boho box braids. If you're thinking of trying calico hair, here's what you can expect: Typically, stylists will want a consultation ahead of your actual appointment. “Everyone's vision of calico hair is very different,” says Lois Bonsu, a London-based hairstylist specializing in textured hair. While the trend works for a range of lengths, curl types, and densities, this part of the process shouldn't be skipped or rushed as it helps ensure the outcome is exactly what you want. If you have medium-to-long hair, you're the ideal candidate for this trend, explains Bonsu. The longer your hair, the easier it is to section and place the color. If you have short hair, it's not impossible, as you'll see in our photo inspiration below, you just may be limited in color and placement options. Maelee Baxter, a Gainesville, Florida-based hairstylist and colorist, suggests that if you have straight or wavy hair, you may want to consider stripes of color for a more striking look. “If you have kinky or curly hair, going for more of a grid pattern or abstract blocking of the color can [have a] higher impact, especially because you can see more of the interior layering and texture with curlier hair,” she says. Bonsu adds that “on textured hair, it looks like an actual calico cat. You can really see the vision coming true.” On the day of your appointment, your colorist will begin by sectioning your hair, taking note of which areas will be dyed. If you have dark hair, those areas will need to be lifted to a blonde shade. Bonsu says the hair is then rinsed and blow-dried before it's dyed. You can expect this process to take between three and six hours, depending on your texture and length. Bonsu says she'll do reparative treatments for textured hair because it tends to be drier and more fragile than straighter strands. Calico hair, like the feline it was inspired by, needs love and attention. Try not to wash your hair more than once a week. If you have fine hair or a scalp that tends to get oily, Bonsu suggests trying to stretch the time between washes to at least three days. Temple,Texas-based hairstylist Raven Carnes adds that, after shampooing and conditioning, you might want to do a final rinse with cold waters. “This will help [preserve] the longevity of the color as well as prevent any potential bleeding from the copper or dark sections onto the blonde,” she explains. New York City-based board-certified dermatologist Ellen Marmur agrees that the temperature of the water can affect how much your hair color fades. “When exposed to warm or hot water, the [hair] cuticle cells become more pliable and may lift slightly,” she says, which can release color molecules. “In contrast, cold water exposure induces cuticle contraction. The cuticle cells lay flatter against the hair shaft, creating a smoother surface,” helping lock in color and create shine. And you're going to want to stock your shower with color-safe shampoo. Bonsu suggests Redken's Acidic Bonding Concentrate range. We also like the Nexxus Color Assure Shampoo, which is formulated with strengthening amino acids, which your hair could use after you've bleached and/or dyed it. Redken Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Conditioner $30 Shop Now Nexxus Color Assure Shampoo $16 Amazon (13.5 oz.) $18 Walmart (16.5 oz.) You'll also want to saturate your hair with masks and treatments at least once a month. Carnes recommends K18's Leave-In Molecular Repair Hair Mask, a bond-building mask that Allure editors have seen smooth their color-treated, brittle strands. For a traditional moisturizing formula, I recommend the Best of Beauty Award-winning Fekkai Super Strength + Repair Mask. Best Hydrating Hair Mask Fekkai Super Strength + Repair Mask $40 Ulta Beauty Bonsu suggests touch-ups every six weeks. Those with curly or coily hair might be able to stretch the time between touchups, says Baxter, as the “tightness of the texture almost hides the [growing] roots a little bit more. The curls tend to shrink.” If you decide to let your hair grow out for more than a month, be prepared for a longer touch-up appointment, as it can be more challenging to match the multiple colors to their original placements if you have a lot of growth, Baxter explains. You might also need time for additional lightening if you have dark roots. The multicolor mix of calico colors might take some back to the early 2000s, but this version of chunky highlights firmly belongs to the 2020s...."

With each coach boasting remarkable portfolios across fashion, film, and television, JC reinforces its reputation as the go-to destination for young dreamers with big ambition. At JC, aspiring models, actors, and influencers aren't just learning from textbooks—they're learning from professionals who are thriving in the entertainment and fashion industries. The trio of Darvinique, Melissa, and Zoie are not only experienced performers but also proven professionals whose guidance and mentorship are transforming lives at JC every day. Darvinique Hawthorne: A Voice of Versatility in Entertainment With credits spanning across lead and supporting roles, red carpet hosting, and live event promotions, Darvinique Hawthorne exemplifies the well-rounded, working actor that JC seeks to model for its students. Represented by MTM Agency, Darvinique's on-camera experience includes leading roles in “Love Under Serious Temptation” and “HOUSTON Leading Medicine,” as well as key supporting appearances in films like “Dark Summer” and “The RING WIDOW.” Her adaptability and professionalism have earned her recurring roles with Purple Heart Productions and features with ALL3N DNA Films. Her on-camera charisma extends off-screen too—Darvinique has hosted red carpet events for productions such as “Bloody Nickel” and events honoring sports legends like MBA Terry Cummings. She trains JC talent with authenticity and authority in commercial technique, monologue delivery, and voiceover craft. Her commitment to helping students find their own voice has become a hallmark of the John Casablancas experience. A proud graduate of John Casablancas herself, Darvinique now teaches from a full-circle perspective—equipping young talent with techniques in teleprompter reading, cold reads, script work, and runway choreography.

Her coaching covers everything from scene study and audition prep to on-camera technique and character development. With certifications in CPR and training from industry giants like Howard Fine Studios and KD Conservatory, Melissa offers both artistic refinement and the practical knowledge necessary to thrive in today's competitive landscape. Fluent in Spanish and conversational in Portuguese, Melissa also empowers diverse talent to own their voice and embrace their cultural identities—crucial elements in an industry that is rapidly diversifying. Her presence within JC is not just inspiring—it's strategic. Zoie Zeller: From Vogue Covers to NYFW—Runway Royalty Meets Real-World Mentor A high-fashion force with a commercial edge, Zoie Zeller's modeling portfolio reads like a global campaign rollout. From walking in New York Fashion Week an astonishing thirteen seasons in a row to gracing the pages of Italian Vogue and British Vogue, Zoie has worked with the fashion elite—including Nars, Redken, Tory Burch, Michael Kors, Pureology, North Face, and Citizen Watches. She has become the standard of what's possible for JC's modeling talent. Whether it's fashion shows for Golden Goose or e-commerce for brands like Ph5, Macy's, and Neiman Marcus, Zoie's command of the runway and camera makes her an indispensable coach for JC's aspiring models. Her appearances in hit series like Gossip Girl and Three Women may be background credits, but her fashion work is front and center on the world stage. What sets Zoie apart isn't just her modeling success—it's how she bridges the industry's high standards with personal mentorship. She works closely with JC talent on runway steps, posing, proper on-set & audition etiquette, portfolio strategy, and the grit it takes to stand out in castings.

1ll21yh,2025-06-26 14:48:36,en,REDDIT,"  Okay so I've never written a review here before but I just had to talk about this because my hair hasn't felt this good in a while. I have very fine, straight hair with an oily scalp and dry ends. It's not really damaged but just gets super fluffy, frizzy and full of flyaways especially in this horrible humidity. I was using Dove Dryness Care for the longest time and honestly it's a pretty good range! It made my hair feel soft and clean, and I think it works great if you're in a dry climate. But in humid weather, it started making my hair look puffy and flyaway-ish. Like too much moisture and no control. Yesterday I saw a post on this sub about the new Dove Peptide Bond Strength mask and I got instantly influenced 😂 The mask was available on Myntra and it was gonna take a few days to reach, but I couldn't wait so I ordered the shampoo from Amazon and the conditioner from Blinkit (yes I'm that impatient). I washed my hair today with the shampoo and conditioner and omg??? Even while rinsing the shampoo, my hair already felt smooth and silky, which never happens. Then I left the conditioner on for around 5–6 mins. After towel drying, I used a bit of my Redken ABC leave-in and now my hair is just smooth, shiny, soft, bouncy and no frizz/flyaways. It just looks sleek and feels really light. I haven't felt this happy with a shampoo/conditioner combo in a long time. Really excited for the mask to arrive now because if just the shampoo + conditioner did this, I can't wait to see what the mask does. Anyway yeah, if you have a similar hair type maybe give this a try."

n0psk0z,2025-07-01 06:30:27,en,REDDIT,"  Thank you so much for your kind words! I'm so sorry you didn't get the birth you dreamed of either, and I hope you are able to get your dream VBAC. You put into words so much of what I've been feeling but struggling to articulate- missing the first cries, meeting her after my husband and mom got to, but loving watching her personality develop. My girl has giggled twice now, once at the ceiling fan and once at the cat running on her giant hamster wheel. I think she likes things that spin 😂 Bought some toys from Amazon to test that theory and see if I can hear that gorgeous giggle again soon. Loving every minute with her, and desperately trying to forget the trauma of how she came into this world. From feeling her tiny fluttery kicks to mom telling me how beautiful and perfect she is because everyone else got to see her first to then getting to be the one to send her videos of baby's milestones as it should be. Thinking of you and your family. Thank you again so much for taking the time to read and share your experience If it helps, I'm really loving Redken shampoo. A couple weeks before my daughter was born I impulsively dyed my hair and I've been using Redken Color Magnetics. Color has held on well and I've had minimal postpartum hair loss. Before dying my hair I liked the way Redken All Soft made my hair look and feel, although it smells a touch too much like coconut for my personal preferences."

n0t29qm,2025-07-01 18:46:14,en,REDDIT,"  lots of other folks have mentioned that the example picture is dimensional vs all over color. like others have said, it would be better to use a 20 vol developer with the lightener powder for a longer period of time, instead of using 30 volume for a shorter period of time. if you got to the strand test color in 30 mins with 30 volume, you can definitely achieve it with a longer processing time using 20 volume and you'd be less likely to cause major damage. you can process for up to an hour, so just keep checking the color while the lightener processes. my recommendation would be to lighten your entire head in sections like you said you plan to, to get to a base color similar to what your strand test looks like. if you can wait a couple days and do some deep conditioning treatments after you have your base color, that would be best. i'd then go back in with a technique like this to achieve something similar to the highlights shown in your goal picture — she's obviously using a different tone of color here, but the takeaway of the video should be the lightener application techniques: https://youtu.be/gegncnXXxi0 pay attention to the volumes she is using — DO NOT go back in to highlight your base with 30 volume developer, your highlights will fry. you must use a 10 volume developer and give it time to process. she also has a lot of other great videos about doing highlights if you wanna browse her channel — again, don't focus on the color/toner shades she's using, just the bleach application techniques to help achieve the dimensional look in your example. imo, if you are okay with your base color matching your swatch, you'd be better off leaving it at that and then adding the highlights with a volume 10 developer, versus trying to lighten your whole head again. your hair would be much better off that way, versus trying to push it with another whole head application of lightener! you'd be very close to the example photo anyway after toning. sally's ion line has an olaplex dupe that you should definitely pick up. it's under $15 and one set would probably get you through 2-3 processes, so you might wanna pick up 2 boxes if your hair is thick, because it would be better to to have a little extra for next time vs. running out. here's the link, they have it in stores too: https://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-color/other-products-and-applications/fillers-and-additives/absolute-perfection-dual-kit/SBS-405019.html i'd also buy some k18 and apply it before/after processes: cheapest option here that i have been able to squeeze 2-3 applications out of in the past, but you'd be better off investing in the $30 pump bottle that's available on amazon: https://www.target.com/p/k18-leave-in-molecular-repair-hair-mask-0-17-oz/-/A-85972091 and then use a bond repairing shampoo and conditioner to help rebuild your hair integrity after all these processes. redken's bond repair line is pretty good and relatively affordable! pick up a nice serum too to keep the mids/ends healthy. if you can't invest in these products, i promise your hair would look better at whatever color it is now than lighter and unhealthy! but i think if you invest in the bond builder from sally's, k18, and a bond repairing shampoo and conditioner, your goal example is within reach. also not sure what your current base color is like or if you've done a whole head lightening process before, but make sure you understand how to apply the lightener for a whole head application so you don't end up with an uneven base color before you go back in to highlight. if you don't apply the lightener correctly you will end up with really uneven color — lighter roots from the heat of your head accelerating the bleach, etc. here is a good video that explains how to approach whole head lightening — as with the other example video, don't focus on the end result color, just pay attention to the techniques used to achieve an even color. adjust the processing times according to your goal base color: https://youtu.be/tYg3ZmbX5iw?si=mXSeHVLH6rBVWubP saw that you don't have sally's in your country. there are other products similar to olaplex; see if you can find ALL hd PLEX or LIW ph plex! i think you'd need to order them online. they are both similar products you will mix into the bleach and color during the color/lightening processes. this step is definitely the most important"

Also- I am planning on using Redken Crystal Clear gloss a couple of days before to help avoid the porous parts from soaking up too much colour!"
1lphmey,2025-07-02 00:06:21,en,REDDIT,"  Hello, I have done a lot to my hair over the years and about two years ago I got my hair totally fried off by a stylist! So I covered it with black box dye as a natural blonde… I have had it for about 2 years, only touching up the roots with black every month or so. It's definitely healthy in my opinion and I have used lots of k18 and redken acidic bonding etc. I decided I was done with black and got two color removers (color zap) and my hair lifted a lot actually! I would say it's more of an auburn color now, not super orange or red, kind of orangey brown 6/7 level. No black is left. I planned to do it all myself but got too scared and decided to book a consultation at a rlly good hair salon I like. However I am so nervous to go because my hair looks so fucking ridiculous. I'm afraid to scare my stylist, I know how difficult it is to remove black but I'm hoping to just get to brunette. My hair isn't super long and perfect and I haven't cut it in forever plus I cut my own shitty bangs😭, anyway I am embarrassed to go in there for some reason! If anyone's a hairstylist, please let me know how you would feel! I just want to finally fix my mistake professionally, but I'm just embarrassed of my orange hair…"
mov_6D2AFB662BDB0CE37F94793B39DE0E6C,2025-07-02 04:33:59,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]La cura dei capelli è una combinazione di attenzioni preventive e gesti riparatori, che si uniscono in un fronte comune per mantenere la chioma in salute. Il sole e il freddo, ma anche cloro e salsedine, vento e inquinamento sono tutti elementi che affliggono le lunghezze, rendendole ispide, spente e indomabili. Oltre ai viraggi di colore, le conseguenze del tempo all'aria aperta e dei bagni, al mare o in piscina, includono il danneggiamento delle cuticole che rivestono il capello, la perdita di idratazione e oli naturali e l'accumulo di umidità - da cui si genera il crespo. Nebulizzare sulle ciocche prodotti protettivi o protezioni solare è il miglior modo per contenere il più possibile i danni. Per quanto, però, le e altri trattamenti come siano un valido alleato, i prodotti nutrienti e idratanti, come i balsami e le maschere, rimangono un must per tutto l'anno. Il balsamo da usare sui capelli rovinati e secchi Nella vasta offerta di prodotti dopo shampoo disponibili sul mercato, ce n'è uno che risulta particolarmente calzante per prendersi cura dei capelli rovinati. La sua formula contiene oli preziosi curativi e un complesso di estratti naturali che sigillano gli oli e l'acqua all'interno delle cuticole, rivitalizzando e setificando i capelli. Si tratta del Gold Lust Repair & Restore, il balsamo per capelli danneggiati ideato da Oribe. L'olio di argan illumina, quello di maracuja migliora l'idratazione, l'estratto di cipresso nutre, mentre il complesso a base di anguria, lici ed estratto di fiore di stella alpina fornisce ai capelli un booster di antiossidanti che proteggono dallo stress ossidativo e dalla perdita di colore. Ad aggiungersi, infine, a questa ricca composizione specifica per capelli rovinati sono un complesso bio-ristorativo a base di collagene vegano, caffeina e biotina e un pool proteico che, nell'insieme, vanno a rinforzare la fibra capillare sia dentro che fuori, rigenerando la chioma. Per ottenere benefici visibili a ogni risciacquo, il consiglio è di lasciare il balsamo in posa per almeno un minuto prima di risciacquare. L'effetto finale vede i capelli di nuovo luminosi, morbidi, nutriti e idratati in profondità, oltre che protetti da possibili danni in seguito all'applicazione.

1lqzqi6,2025-07-03 20:17:41,en,REDDIT,"  ! [img](9fapcy00vpaf1) Hi all! I wanted to share my growth journey and haircare routine as I heal from a bixie gone wrong and grow out a cut and color. No pics of the bixie because I hated it that much. I enjoy reading others' hair journeys, so here's my routine and my story. Hopefully it helps someone else out too. I used ChatGPT to help format my routine and hair history for an organized snapshot: **🧼 My Routine** * **Washing** I'm team **daily wash**—otherwise I get major scalp oiliness, flakes, smell, and breakouts. I alternate: * **L'Oréal EverPure Clarifying Shampoo + Restoring Conditioner** * **L'Oréal EverPure Hyaluron Plump Shampoo + Redken All Soft Conditioner** * **Amika The Kure Mask** – used occasionally for repair * **Scalp Care (once a week)** 1. Oil with **Mielle Rosemary Mint Oil** in sections 2. Massage oil in with fingertips 3. Do **scalp gua sha** for circulation 4. Use a **bamboo bristle brush** for 5–10 minutes, focusing on stimulating the scalp 5. Wash the oil out with **2 rounds of clarifying shampoo**, then condition based on how my hair feels * **After washing** * I apply **Kérastase Elixir Ultime Oil** on damp (microfiber towel-dried) hair * Reapply to dry ends as needed for softness & shine * I used to **blow-dry the scalp** lightly after washing to prevent wet flakes but do this less now **✂️ My Hair Journey (Life context + Cut regret)** * In 2024, my dad passed away from brain cancer. After he died, I had a grief spiral and did a drastic **DIY chop and color**. * It wasn't terrible, but I wanted something more refined. I found a stylist known for **short razor cuts** and asked for a bixie… * …but what I got was very “**toy soldier**” / **mushroom cap** vibes. The cut didn't allow for the style I brought in—despite handing over a literal **printed mood board**. * It was devastating. That was **August 2024**. * I've been growing it out ever since, now **July 2025**. * I did a **small self-trim between May and June** and it helped SO much with shape and confidence. * I'm also growing out my **natural color** now. **💡Current Focus** * Looking for **heatless styling** tips for short-to-medium length hair * Loving the **Sleepy Tie** for volume—though my hair isn't quite long enough to fully stay secured in it overnight * Would love to hear what others recommend for shape + volume at this awkward stage"

The division accounted for 11% of L'Oréal's 2024 sales, with haircare as its #2 growth category behind fragrance Color Wow's Edge: ✨ Founded by gail federici (co-founder of John Frieda Professional Care  John Frieda) ✨ Hero products like @Dream Coat built a cult following and Amazon dominance (14.8% share in hairspray) ✨ 878K+ TikTok followers and nearly 800K units sold on TikTok Shop ✨ 73% Amazon growth YoY, 24% EMV growth, and unmatched product page storytelling This deal follows a flurry of beauty transactions: ✅ Unilever acquired Dr. Squatch ($1.5B) and K18 ($700M) ✅ E.L.F. BEAUTY scooped up rhode skin (up to $1B) ✅ Church & Dwight Co., Inc. & Dwight bought touchland (up to $880M) Industry insiders say this is no anomaly—it's a signal. Performance, staying power, and science-backed results are driving the next wave of high-value exits. Is haircare the next billion-dollar beauty frontier? Which brands are poised to be next?

1ls2y7d,2025-07-05 06:03:12,en,REDDIT,"  So I recently went to a hair salon last Friday to get a cut and some face framing done a week ago at the place I normally go to the cut itself was great but when it came to styling thats where it all went wrong! When styling my hair they used TWO diffusers on my head with VERY high heat and no protectent for probably 10-20 minutes maybe even longer. I felt like my scalp and face was melting off during this, not to mention the curl styling they left me with was very artificial curls. My hair felt so bad after this idk how to describe it as it'd my first time feeling the texture but it was very coarse feeling and not at all the silky smooth hair I normally enjoy. I did recently change my hair products too around the same time just cause I ran out of my old product and wanted to try something new that would benefit my hair and at first thought it might be the new product but the more I think about that experience the weirder it sounds in my head. The products I currently use is the matrix a curl can dream shampoo and conditioner, goldwell curl cream with the addition of the wow dream coat for curly hair spray. The shampoo and curl cream are new previously used the redken mega curl line which i did like but it was a little costly over time. I haven't changed my routine either but its not a very stable one, brush my hair while in the shower while washing scrunch it to get rid of excess water and then put some products in. I normally air dry due to not having alot of time before I need to leave when I have extra time I will diffuse but low heat and low speed with protectent in my hair. This normally gives my hair an extra oummff but when I tried to diffuse today it just didnt even want to curl! The first photo was my hair before the cut/style from the hair salon only with redken shampoo and the wow curl spray applied and left to air dry. The second photo was taken today after a full wash shampoo and conditioner curl cream and spray plus diffused! I'm really not sure if maybe I'm just not doing something right but the last wash i did after the experience was left to air dry and had similar results with little to NO curls. I really feel like the only parts that curl now are the strands around my face that didnt get attacked by the two diffusers. Not seeing my hair automatically curl around itself after brushing it was really a kick in a gut and a realisation that they may have screwed me over. Im fairly new to my hair journey and I'm scared and stressed that I have to restart and spend alot of money trying to fix this!! I will note that curly hair specialised spots are not common or popular where i live so any advice is greatly appreciated"

The newlyweds exchanged vows at St Paul's Cathedral in London today, with Mel, 50, having announced her engagement to the hairdresser in October 2022. Celebrity faces were spotted arriving at the ceremony this afternoon, with those on the guest list including former bandmate Emma Bunton, known as Baby Spice, who attended with her partner, Jade Jones, and son, Beau. Other famous pals donning their finery for the grand occasion included Katherine Ryan, Alan Carr, Angellica Bell, Daisy Lowe, Cara Delevingne, and Gaby Roslin. Noticeably absent were Spice Girls Victoria Beckham and Mel C, but VB's parents, Tony and Jackie Adams, were present. The fashion designer also reached out to Mel ahead of the wedding with a sweet social media post. Ahead of the wedding, Scary Spice Mel worked closely with Evelie Bridal and Josephine Scott to design her luxury georgette crepe gown. Of course, all eyes were on her show-stopping dress as Mel arrived at the cathedral, and upon her exit, new husband on her arm as they climbed into a horse-drawn carriage to make their getaway, royal wedding-style. Caroline Black, owner of Evelie Bridal, told the PA news agency: 'For her look at St Paul's Cathedral, Melanie B wanted a bespoke gown that embodies strength, sensuality, and timeless glamour.' The dress has been described by Caroline as a 'luxury georgette crepe gown with a sculpted corset bodice', featuring 'intricate draping that hugs the silhouette and flows into a dramatic, sweeping train'. It also had a 'sheer illusion detachable jacket, hand-embellished with pearl constellations,' which has been described as creating a high-neck, long-sleeve effect that framed the singer's shoulders and added 'ethereal elegance to complement the ceremony and honour St Paul's etiquette'. Mel also wore a cathedral-length veil, which was embroidered with scattered pearls to complete the look. Speaking about the process of styling the Wannabe hitmaker for her wedding day, Caroline hailed it as 'an honour' and 'nothing short of extraordinary'. She said: 'Helping a real Spice Girl choose her wedding dress—what could possibly top that? 'But what's truly made this experience so meaningful is getting to know Mel as just Mel, not the icon, but the woman.' Josephine added: 'Designing this gown for Mel was about capturing her fearless spirit and softness all in one look. 'She's iconic, powerful, and radiant—and this dress had to be worthy of that. 'Every detail was chosen to honour her strength and sensuality while celebrating the woman and the love story beneath the girl power.' Mel was previously married to Stephen Belafonte until she filed for divorce in 2017 following allegations of abuse. They have a daughter, Madison Brown Belafonte. Mel B also has two daughters, Phoenix Chi Gulzar and Angel Iris Murphy Brown, from two previous relationships. Who is Mel B's husband, Rory McPhee? Rory is a celebrity hairstylist said to be a specialist when it comes to curly styles. He's previously worked with fellow stylist Lee Stafford and for major brand Redken, which is part of the L'Oreal group. Mel and Rory didn't get together romantically until 2018, despite knowing each other for years before. It's believed he was a family friend of Mel's cousin, having gone to school with Christian Cooke. Rory's hairdressing expertise is believed to have helped him in wooing Mel, as the star chopped her famous curls off after her previous relationship ended. While Rory began 'nurturing' her locks, she praised him for doing the same to her 'belief in love again and trust'. Got a story?

Toners- last supply, step- you have to tint your hair with another demi-permanent to cancel any orange (better to wait for the bleach to get rid of it, actually-) or green or pink or yellow PLUS add the tones you want- like ash, or gold, or icy or buttery or beige blonde-  etc Check Redken EQ Glosses on Cosmeticworld in Canada- they have a chart that's easy to read! If you want level 8 and 9 highlights, pick a level 9 toner you like, any slightly less bleached areas will still pick up the tones at their level (7 or 8, eg) You can find both demi-permanent (YES) and permanent (NO) toners on Amazon as well. if your strand test got stuck on any orange, wait longer bleach it out, + choose a toner with a B(lue)or A(sh) or I If your strand test had red or pink in it, choose a toner that includes G or green-gold If your strand test has very yellow tones you want to tone down, make sure there's a V or violet or mauve in the toner Recommend: Use demi- and the suggested developer, or a 10 vol developer They all need a low vol peroxide developer (Redken's EQ developer is 7 vol w/ an acid,  Wella's Color charm 10 vol w/an acid) - max is plain 10 vol for this because a higher peroxide will begin to remove colours again!

Loved for its ability to dry and style the hair while inflicting no heat damage on our strands, it's become a cult hair tool for good reason. The tool has six attachments, including the flyaway attachment and extra-long curling barrels. This particular model is designed for people with hair on the longer side, and with 20% off, it's a rare deal that you'll probably want to take advantage of. Shop now Elizabeth Arden Eight Hour Daily Hydrating Body Lotion 380ml $37.07 (was $55) at Amazon Elizabeth Arden's cult-famous Eight Hour Cream is an icon for a reason. So much so that Elizabeth Arden created an entire skincare line off the back of that orangey-peach-y tube of goodness. And yes, that includes body care, too. This body lotion is calming but super-hydrating in a way that our mid-winter skin all needs. It's also infused with shea butter, avocado oil, and glycerin, and helps to restore a impaired skin barrier. shop now Olaplex Hair Perfector No. 3 $45.99 (usually $54) at Amazon Anyone familiar with a bleach and tone will also be well-acquainted with the Olaplex Hair Perfector No. 3. It's a hair treatment that helps to repair the bonds damaged by bleach, and is many hairstylists' secret weapon against prolonged hair damage from colouring. Shop Now COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence 100ml $19.50 (usually $38) at Amazon This serum is praised for its intense hydration and gentle exfoliation properties. Though the texture may take a minute to get used to (let's just say, it's a bit sticky), many reviewers credit this essence for helping to calm the skin while helping to fade dark spots and brighten the skin. shop now Bioderma Hydrabio H2O Micellar Water $29.69 (usually $32.99) at Amazon In case you haven't gathered, we are big fans of French pharmacy beauty buys, and this is one of the best. The Bioderma micellar water range removes makeup without irritating the skin or leaving a heavy film behind, but it also removes all makeup with ease. The Hydrabio range is particularly well-suited for anyone with dehydrated or dry skin, which in the winter months, is probably most of us. Shop Now Revlon One-Step Volumiser Plus 2.0 Blowout Brush $99 (usually $149.99) at Amazon If you don't need all the fancy attachments and just want a round brush hot tool that gives you a bouncy blowout, this is a good option. It has four speed settings and features gently rounded edges to help you add volume or flicked ends without ending up with a full curl. Plus, the brush attachment can be removed, making it more compact for storage. shop now..."

The hairspray wax and mouse is adding product build up and weighing your hair down, and if your not using a sulfate shampoo it's probably not getting washed out well enough. the reality of fine hair is it's too soft to a hold a style, mine only holds a style when it's highlighted because then the damage makes it hold. Pantene volume and body is a really great option for shampoo, and a salicylic acid scalp serum for 15 minutes once a week can help control oil too, shea moisture makes one that's salicylic acid and apple cider vinegar, you can find it at target, Amazon, and ulta."

Then I comb in my Briogeo heat protectant curl cream with my bounce curl brush (there's a dupe on amazon). Then I scrunch in Ouidad Whipped Curls conditioning mousse in the gray bottle. Then I rope in and scrunch Redken sculpting curl gel. Then plop for 15-20 mins. I unwrap my hair when it's damp, then diffuse a bit on high heat low flow, then usually I air dry the rest of the way. Then when it's all dry, I scrunch out the crunch with verb ghost oil on my hands. For a refresh (on non wash days since I only wash three times a week), I spray my hair with a continuous water bottle that has several pumps of Bumble and Bumble curl reactivator inside, as well as a small pump of Redken sculpting curl gel, and water. I usually just rake my fingers through a bit and scrunch, but sometimes I have to use my bounce curl brush if my curls are really out of shape. Then I scrunch in a little Ouidad whipped curls mousse mixed with warm water on my hands. Then when it's dry,  I scrunch out the crunch with Verb ghost oil."

n1x1mh9,2025-07-08 02:29:07,en,REDDIT,"  Don't brush it when it's dry, only soaking wet with conditioner in. You need a product that forms a cast, either a mousse or a gel. I use both. I love Ouidad Whipped curls conditioning mousse, then Redken sculpting gel, then I scrunch out the cast with verb ghost oil on my hands. I only wash 2-3 times a week. On non wash days or for a refresh, get a continuous mist water bottle and fill it with two pumps of curl reactivator and one pump of gel and the rest water. I use Bumble and Bumble reactivator and Redken sculpting curl gel. Spray your hair down and if you feel like you need to comb it wait until it's super damp and slippery and use a wide tooth comb or a bounce curl brush (there's a good dupe on amazon). Then use a small pump of the mousse and scrunch your hair again. When it's completely dry scrunch out the crunch with an oil."
mov_F1254549D1DBD47580C95E78C21C8ABD,2025-07-08 11:59:48,en,WEB,"  Bond treatments are all the rage in the world of haircare. For anyone with frizzy, bleached or damaged lengths, they have become a must in a weekly routine. Now, as someone who was every shade of blonde at one stage, including platinum, I tended to rely on the iconic Olaplex brand to help keep my hair looking healthy, shiny and less frizzy at the ends. However, last year I decided to branch out with the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment that had attracted numerous TikTok videos and glowing reviews from shoppers who billed it as a ""miracle worker."" Read more: 'Sultry' Ghost perfume that 'suits all ages' now under £14 in Prime Day sale Read more: 'I tried a viral K-beauty serum for a week and my skin has never been glowier' That's not all, as for those who are obsessed with celebrity beauty secrets, this hair treatment is used by the current 'it' pop superstar of the moment Sabrina Carpenter, with the 'Espresso' hitmaker now a global ambassador for the Redken brand. To sweeten the deal even further, not only did I find this conditioner to be a ""lifesaver"" for damaged hair, but it's currently on offer for 32 percent less in the Amazon Prime Day sale, reduced from £26.40 to just £17.99 - and I am tempted to stock up for that price. For the beauty fans who are keen to take advantage of the Amazon deal, but aren't sure if the Bonding Treatment is right for them, I have provided below my full thoughts on when I first trialled it last year. ""Despite what you might think, I didn't run into this review with high expectations. I have used Olaplex in the past, which has helped the condition of my hair, but other products on the market don't tend to work well. Trust me, I have tried a lot. ""So, when I brought the Redken Leave-In Treatment on Amazon Prime Day, alongside the Pre-Shampoo Treatment, I decided to try and keep a level head. There's nothing worse than being disappointed, am I right? ""That being said, when I first popped this treatment on my damp ends, my first thought was that it seemed quite heavy, and I worried it would make my hair greasy. I couldn't have been more wrong, because like many reviews mentioned, a little goes a long way. ""I only needed just larger than a pea size amount to coat my lengths and ends evenly, and it melted in without weighing my fine hair down, unlike many other leave-in conditioners."" ""Considering many reviews and videos on TikTok say this treatment left their hair ""visibly healthier"" immediately, I was genuinely surprised to find myself agreeing with them. ""The first time I used the leave-in treatment, I used it alongside the pre-shampoo treatment and my hair felt smoother, with less tangles for my comb to snarl through. As soon as I blow dried my hair with the treatment in, I could notice that the broken, damaged ends of my hair were visibly smoother and a little shinier as well. ""Long gone were the gnarled looking straggly ends, and in their place was smooth, shiny hair that looked as though it had never been touched by any damage. Honestly, as someone who struggles with her fine hair, I was immediately surprised at the magic. ""After using the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment during my hair wash days in the week, I noticed that my hair doesn't look as damaged. ""Even though I've used it a few times now, the bottle still feels full, which is insane value for money. Considering my thin hair can go through products like crazy due to its weaker nature, I think that this treatment will be a staple that will save me cash in the long run. ""It's not just saving me money, as my hair genuinely feels softer and less fragile since I began using it. While it's no replacement for a good salon visit to cut off the dead ends, it's certainly a miracle worker in between appointments that has helped save my over processed hair to look, leaving it in much better condition."" Purchase my new go-to hair hero the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment for 32 percent less in the Amazon Prime Day event now. For a few alternatives worth trying out, I would still personally recommend the Olaplex No.6 Bond Smoother that is also on offer on Amazon for £19.80, down from £28. Over at Boots, one shoppers also say is a good option is the L'Oréal Paris Elvive Bond Repair Leave-In Serum that costs £16.99."

1lvaibq,2025-07-09 05:14:28,en,REDDIT,"  hair growth from march 25(my last haircut) and july 2nd. okay i'm just gonna start off by saying my hair is sooo damaged and i'm on my journey to growing it out healthy and long. i've made some sort of progress which i'll show a picture of but now that that's out of the way i need some serious advice! i saw on tiktok recently that ur hair type doesn't matter but instead your hair porosity?? but idk either of them so im scared ive been doing everything wrong on my hair care journey i have very thin pin straight hair. i recently bleached underneath of my head and dyed it pink with splat. my hair has gotten thicker since i've started oiling it but its still on the thinner side ESPECIALLY when it's oily. my hair is about bra strap length and when it gets to there it  stops growing so i think its genetics?? my hair is oily at the roots and super dry at my ends. my main concern is breakage which i'll also attach a picture of. it doesn't break as much anymore as it used to, but i have very short hairs in some places and my hair just looks messy because of it. i tried looking up the different characteristics for hair porosity and i think im in the middle at the top of my head but high porosity near my ends? i just showered at about 1140 and its now 1am and my hair is still pretty wet. i dyed my hair less than a week ago and my color is fading already and i looked it up and it said i probably have high porosity?? but idk. i listed all the products i use after this and if anyone has any suggestions for anything i should change or just like literally anything let me know!! i want my hair to be healthy again the products i currently use: -holiroots the ritual oil; i leave this in my hair before every washday (wednesday/sunday) and i put a bit on my ends aswell. i keep it on for a minimum of an hour and maximum a whole day. -redken extreme length poo/condition; i use this nearly every shower and if im not using this im using the all soft by redken -oaui detox shampoo; i use this before using my redken shampoo, so i shampoo twice. -amika the kure/soulfood masks; i used to use the kure but i ran out so now i use my normcore one. i use this for 10 mins and then condition with my redken conditioner. -oaui leave in conditioner; i only recently started using this, but i used to use the it's a 10 keratin leave in. i heard it was too harsh for ur hair so i js stopped using it. -redken anti-snap/split end sealer leave in; i dont use my anti-snap leave in as much anymore, but i do still use my split end sealer. i think these are both amazing products. -kerastase night serum; i use this before i sleep to prevent breakage but only sometimes when my hair feels super dry. i like this stuff a lot too since my ends don't feel as dry as they normally do. -argon oil; i dont really know where its from but sometimes i will apply it to my ends and idk it seems to work a little 🤷‍♀"
mov_8648266BC368754E5686EF1AB7827AF6,2025-07-09 06:00:00,en,WEB,"  Beauty that's worth buying As a beauty journalist, I've had the opportunity to try thousands of products over the years. From game-changing skincare innovation to viral makeup launches and pro-approved hair tools, my dressing table is a constantly revolving display of the latest and greatest in beauty. And yet, even with access to new products every day, I have curated a selection of staples I return to time and time again that deliver without fail. I used to have to traipse around sourcing them from various high street shops and ordering from different websites, but with Amazon's recent expansion into premium beauty, many of them are available online with next day delivery—and now, some of them are part of the latest Prime Day offerings. With so many deals flying around, so I wanted to share my absolute beauty must-buys to streamline your shopping list. From the self-tan mist that doesn't require any blending, to the multi-tasking hair hero I've been using for years, these are the products I trust and love enough to use on repeat. And yes, I will be buying multiples. Whether you want to stock up on products that you can be sure are worth your money, or are looking to test out something new (without the full-price commitment), these picks are where I'd suggest you start this Prime Day. The Best Prime Day Beauty Picks St.tropez Self Tan Purity Face Mist I have tried every face self tan, but return to this one every time. The ultra fine mist means that there's no blending required. None. And it's streak-free and flawless every time. Plus, it dries instantly and doesn't stain my pillow case. It's become a staple in my product roundup—I'm seldom without a bottle (or two!) . Shark Smoothstyle Heated Brush and Comb I love Shark for their powerful tools that make day-to-day styling easier, but I'm particularly a fan of their wet-to-dry hair styling solutions, including their SmoothStyle Brush and Comb. When on wet mode, it doesn't reach hair-damaging temperatures, and the can seamlessly be switched to dry mode to ensure lasting style. In other words it's time-saving, space-saving and hair-saving. Redken One United 25 Multi-Benefits Leave-In Conditioner and Treatment Spray This product may be the gold standard when it comes to multitasking. It delivers a whopping 25 hair benefits in one, from detangling and conditioning, to heat protection and frizz control. Plus, it will make your hair smell fresh from the salon. Elemis Pro-Collagen Marine Oil This is the perfect choice for anyone who says they don't 'do' facial oils. It's super lightweight and packed with marine actives including Padina Pavonica, Golden Seaweed and Roaring Water Kelp for instant skin plumping and lasting hydration. I love to use it for a lymphatic drainage massage along with a Gua Sha or facial roller. Sacheu Lip Liner Stay-N Peel Off Lip Stain I always think it's optimal to try a trending product at a discount in case it's not worth the hype—so if you haven't tried the viral Sacheu Lip Liner, now is your chance. Having said that, this product is worth the hype if you like long-lasting lip products in a range of colours, including Billie Eilish's favourite shade Noo-hed, although I tend to use it as an all-over tint rather than a liner (the applicator is quite wide and doesn't allow you to draw a fine lip line). St.tropez Self Tan Express Mousse While I love a leave-on self-tan mist for my face, I've never been able to master full body self-tans unless they have a guide colour, they dry instantly, and I can wash them off after a few hours. Enter express tanning mousses, i.e. the only self-tan format I can cope with where my body is concerned. This one has a guide colour to ensure zero streaks, and it develops in as little as one hour, after which time you can wash it off and basque in your golden glow. Byoma Milky Moisture Cleanser Milky skincare is having a moment—and for good reason. Originally from Korea (as so many great beauty innovations are), milky skincare includes formulas that are supremely lightweight, hydrating and gentle on the skin. Byoma's hero Miky Cleanser not only boasts all the aforementioned, but also a Tri Ceramide Complex (ceramides, cholesterol, fatty acids) to dissolve daily build up including SPF, oil and makeup while ensuring skin feels soft – never stripped. It's a must-have for sensitive, redness-prone skin. CeraVe SA Smoothing Cleanser CeraVe has long been a beauty editor favourite when it comes to their range of cleansers, and their Salicyclic Acid cleanser is ideal for anyone who struggles with breakouts or congested pores. While the salicyclic acid exfoliates and regulates sebum, hyaluronic acid and ceramides support the skin barrier and boost moisture. Schwarzkopf Schwarzkopf Eyebrow Tint While I'm a natural brunette, my eyebrows missed the memo and have always been a very pale shade of mousey. I rely on at-home tints to save me having to draw my eyebrows on every morning, and to save me the hassle of going to a salon every week to have them dyed professionally. Of all the at-home tints, this one offers a rich colour and lasts the longest...."
n25lmq3,2025-07-09 11:17:01,en,REDDIT,"  “Like steel wool”? Say goodbye to that Nexxus and transition into something like Redken's All Soft line. And I know it's unfair and I hate it too but don't even bother with the conditioner that matches the shampoo. Buy the tube(s) of All Soft Heavy Cream and use as your conditioner. Wash hair first in the shower then comb your conditioner through and clip it up. Leave it on until you're ready to get out then rinse. And it doesn't need to be squeaky clean rinsed out. Apply a leave in (like It's a 10, or Redken or if you're looking to save check out Marc Anthony products on Amazon) to wet hair and comb it through. You can do it flipped upside down in the shower if you want to start scrunching and see if you can get some curls going. Get a hair oil. Plenty of good ones around nearly every price point. Olaplex is nearly weightless, I prefer something heavier. Trader Joe's has a coconut oil serum that's @6 bucks. Also, L'Oréal (who is owned by the same company as their luxury cousin, Kerastase) is at your local store and makes some nice products. I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry- not trying to be rude short or bossy! Please let me know if any of this sounds good or if you'd rather go with a different goal like Paul Mitchell's The Skinny Serum? I'm happy to help! And want to, just needed to get this here so hopefully I'll be back. Hope  you have a wonderful day! (If you're off and staying in, warm up whatever- within reason- oil you have and run it through from mid shaft to ends. Or just put your deep conditioner on and top it with a shower cap. If you want to, of course. Again, so sorry for the rushed delivery!)"

n2aiqey,2025-07-10 02:12:16,en,REDDIT,"  how long did you leave the bleach on? did you use 30vol developer with the powder? it will be really really difficult, probably impossible, to go back in with another round of bleach and not cause breakage from overlap between the roots and the lengths that were already lightened. this is too dark to fix with toner though. **your options are (in order of riskiest to least risky):** 1 - another round of lightening with a volume 10 developer. i would section the hair into quarters, then very precisely apply the bleach as carefully as possible to only the darker section, on only one quarter of your hair. process that quarter, watching super carefully (wiping off a bit of the lightener to check every 5-10mins) and washing out as soon as its light enough. start with a section in the back first so if you get breakage, it's only to one quarter of the hair in the back. do the whole head by completely lightening one quarter of the hair at a time, this would give you the most control and reduce the risk of damage. if something goes wrong with the first section and you end up with a lot of breakage, you could do the rest of the hair with one of these other options. if this is successful, you'd tone with a vol 5 or 10 developer and a light blonde toner. 2 - using a high lift blonde color on the dark band of the hair. look up videos/tutorials about this to see how it works. 3 - coloring the dark band with a darker blonde color (something like a level 7 or 8) and then doing a root tap (right at the root, like an inch) with a shade or two darker (level 7 or 6) than the color you use on the whole dark band. this is the safest bet and would cause the least amount of damage. you could also consider doing some lowlights throughout the lengths with the darker color you use on the band to help add dimension and make things look more blended. regardless of which you choose, i'd still recommend a level 7-8 root tap! it just looks nicer and more professional, esp. when you have darker hair naturally. and with all of these options, you should definitely pick up an olaplex dupe. the type you mix into both bleach and/or toner, not the hair oil or shampoo/conditioner. this will make a huge difference in whether your hair incurs a lot of damage or only a little. sally's has one in their ion line, and there are also other brands on amazon. look up how to use them first, just search on youtube for “olaplex bleach dupe”. i would also pick up k18 to use before / after any more coloring. it would help a lot too. you can buy tiny bottles for $12 that give you 1-2 applications or a decent size bottle for $29 on amazon. the bigger bottle would be better and help preserve your hair longer term since you're processing it so much. and also buy a bond repair shampoo/conditioner to help reduce breakage, redken's is decent and affordable."

If you make a purchase via links on this page we will earn commission – learn more We're currently besotted with Sabrina Carpenter, I mean she's the girl of the moment! But more specifically with her hair. Like how does she keep it so healthy, shiny and blonde all at once? Anyone who's trashed their hair with dye and bleach will know keeping it in good condition is no easy task, but the secret for Sabrina is probably in using Redken – as the international superstar was announced as the brand's first-ever Global Ambassador. Luckily for you, this Amazon Prime Day this July, the products that she swears by for keeping her hair in tip-top condition have been reduced in price, with a saving of up to 33%. Yes both the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Shampoo and Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment have been marked down in the sales event – and you only have until Friday to snap up a bargain or two. By using the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Shampoo (now £17.93 – save 18%), you can transform a year's worth of visible damage in just one use, by using the award-winning Acidic Bonding Concentrate range – starting with the shampoo, a concentrated all-in-one formula suitable for all hair types and textures. The ultra-rich, luxurious shampoo delivers intense conditioning, reduces breakage, and protects against colour fade too. Featuring Citric Acid, an alpha hydroxy acid in Redken's concentrated bonding care complex, this helps protect weak bonds and enhances hair strength and resilience after bleaching or colouring services. Specifically formulated with an acidic pH, this pH-balancing shampoo helps defend against the potential negative effects of hair colouring, lightening, and heat styling. The result? Hair that looks and feels healthy, a la Miss Carpenter. The equally impressive Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment (now £17.80 – save 33%), offers heat protection up to 230 degrees, smooths and tames frizz, adds shine, and provides intense conditioning to help reduce hair breakage. Now we know how and why her hair looks so good, we're going to add into our virtual basket. Looking for more Amazon Prime Big Deal Days stories?

n2ipn7b,2025-07-11 09:23:25,en,REDDIT,"  OPI is a professional brand that was subject to a lot of diversion early on. They technically only were sold at salons and beauty supply stores, which is why you'd never see their brand new collections or any PR displays at target. Gelish is also a professional brand, you can only buy their minis at Sally's, full size is at cosmoprof / salon centric. Redken & Paul Mitchell never used to be available anywhere either, brands sell to conglomerates, or just decide to now also sell to the public sometimes. There's still plenty of brands at cosmoprof that you cannot (shouldn't be able to) buy anywhere else, other than in a salon. People are unaware of diversion and that they're buying things that did not come directly from the company. However resell sites also exist, like beyondpolish- where you can buy OPI gel at a markup. It's also posted on Amazon sometimes. So yes, professional-only brands exist, OPI used to be one. This typically means sold only to people with a license *or in salons. * If you're going to a pro that uses beetles, fucking run."

1lyf8vh,2025-07-13 00:18:49,en,REDDIT,"  Hi everyone! So, i was literally crying the other day cause i don't know how to handle my hair (tmi, i know). My dad was the only person in my life that had curly hair and he passed away so I never learnt how to take care of it. I decided that I wanted to stop blowing out my hair and embrace my natural hair but I have no idea what to use on my hair. I don't know about curl types or patterns or anything. All I know is I have low porosity hair. Routine and Products I've used: In Shower Routine: &Honey Damage Shampoo, Redken Cleansing Cream (once every two to three weeks when my hair is really oily). &Honey Damage Conditioner. Shiseido Tsubaki and Fino hair mask. Curl Specific Products I've tried: Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Gel, Cream and Mouse. I tried using a diffuser but I feel like maybe the setting was on too high because my hair dried very quickly and didn't feel stiff or like there was a cast despite the amount of gel I used. I'm too scared to use deeper hydration products out of fear it will weigh my hair down significantly."
