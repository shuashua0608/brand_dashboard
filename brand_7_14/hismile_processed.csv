Learn more With sun-soaked holidays, garden gatherings and grand celebrations on the cards this summer, it's the perfect time to think about teeth whitening. But knowing what brand to turn to can be difficult, especially with so much on offer. However, Dermatest - a German collection of dermatologists and dentists that work with organisations like the Fraunhofer Society - has given MySweetSmile their 5-star Seal of Approval. This means it's been rigorously tested by their researchers to guarantee safety during application. For the brand, this means their products were tested to be safe for the enamel, boast sensitivity-free protection and also are effective at what they do. MySweetSmile is the UK's top peroxide-free teeth whitening brand, including the Teeth Whitening Powder and Teeth Whitening Strips.

On Amazon, a set of 42 strips is currently tagged at £19.95, but there's an opportunity to cut costs further by snagging an extra 5% off, making it a more wallet-friendly choice. Meanwhile, Superdrug is dishing out discounts of up to 33% on HiSmile dental care items, including the PAP+ Teeth Whitening Strips now down from £29 to an attractive £19. Meanwhile, MySweetSmile's most popular product is their Teeth Whitening Powder, boasting Pentasodium Triphosphate for safe, enamel-friendly cleaning – ideal even for sensitive teeth. They are currently offering a 20% markdown on their Teeth Whitening Powder, dropping from £29.99 to £23.99. The product has amassed a fan base of over 250,000 users and proudly sits with a stellar review score of 4.7 out of 5. Feedback has been overwhelmingly positive, with many praising it as the best they've used. A particularly pleased 77 year old customer revealed: ""I am 77 years old and I bought this thinking it's going to be like everything you see advertised, but to my surprise, it's made my old teeth look amazing. I shall be ordering again."" Another satisfied user commented: ""A really great product, not only does it remove stains it makes your teeth much whiter and brighter, it seems to be the only product I've found that actually leaves your teeth feeling clean and fresh. This was my 2nd order. With super speedy delivery as well."" However, not all reviews were positive, with one person saying: ""Cleans teeth very well but this small tub is more like a sample tub as it didn't really whiten my teeth by much. In my case I'd probably need a lot of these tubs for it to work."" Elsewhere, their PAP Teeth Whitening Strips are intended to clear out stains and discolouration in seven days. The brand says the peroxide-free composition doesn't cause irritation or sensitivity while also ensuring enamel protection during treatment. The Teeth Whitening Strips boast a 4.6-star out of five-star rating and also comes with a 20% discount, dropping the price from £29.99 to £23.99. One pleased customer said: ""I've tried a lot of whitening strips and MySweetSmile's are by far the best on the market. They stick well, don't slide around, and my teeth are noticeably whiter after just a few uses without any sensitivity when drinking cold water and tea."" Another said: ""After trying MySweetSmile's whitening powder - I knew I had to try the new PAP Whitening Strips to pair with it. It's safe to say I'm nothing short of amazed. I have gotten compliments on the whiteness and cleanliness of my teeth from family and friends almost daily since the use of these strips! They pair with the powder like magic."" Article continues below However, some shoppers have described the application of teeth whitening strips as quite troublesome, with one stating: ""The strips were a major faff to use"". To tackle this issue, MySweetSmile suggests that consumers ""leave a small area overhanging to speed up the removal process, in order to assist with strip removal.""

I've always had trouble with toothpaste flavors and the awful toothbrush texture, but something I've found that helps for me personally is all of the different flavors of HiSmile toothpaste (idk if you've heard of them but they have soooo many good flavors, though I'd personally not recommend the cream or dairy flavored ones even if they have another flavor mixed in, they genuinely kind of have a dairy taste and its disconcerting for toothpaste imo)"

One of the bolder promo plays of the week came from Hismile who look set to log a bumper week off the back of double barrel masterbrand promos with ~24 SKUs half price in Woolies and ~30 SKUs at 40% off in Coles. Coca-Cola Europacific Partners had a solid week of digital execution in both majors with a home page video for Coles supporting the Mount Franklin SecondBite campaign and a 10x Boost Rewards homepage carousel slot in Woolworths for the Coca-Cola and Powerade brands.
