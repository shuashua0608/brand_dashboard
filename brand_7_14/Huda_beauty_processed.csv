Lip Stains sind die Geheimwaffe für alle, die sich einen natürlichen, langanhaltenden Farbkick auf den Lippen wünschen. Aber was genau verbirgt sich hinter diesem Beauty-Trend und welche Produkte halten, was sie versprechen? Wir verraten dir alles über die revolutionären Lippentönungen und stellen die sechs besten Lip Stains vor, die dein Make-up-Game ab sofort für immer verändern werden. Wie funktioniert ein Lip Stain? Lip Stains (oder auch Lip Tints genannt) sind flüssige Lippentönungen, die deine Lippen von innen heraus färben, anstatt nur oberflächlich zu wirken. Anders als herkömmliche Lippenstifte oder Glosse ziehen sie in die oberen Hautschichten ein und hinterlassen eine natürlich wirkende Farbe, die stunden- oder sogar tagelang hält. Je nach Produkt bleibt die Farbe auf den Lippen oder du musst sie abwischen bzw. abziehen. Das Beste daran? Sie überstehen problemlos Mahlzeiten, Getränke und sogar intensive Knutscherei, hehe. #1 Wonderskin – Wonder Blading Lip Stain Peel Off Masque Die Mutter aller Lip Tints kommt definitiv von der Brand Wonderskin. Der innovative Lip Stain ist zunächst tatsächlich knallblau, doch keine Sorge, bei dieser Farbe bleibt's nicht. Du trägst den Lip Tint auf, lässt es kurz einwirken und ziehst dann die blaue Peeling-Schicht ab. Zurück bleibt eine perfekte, natürliche Tönung, die bis zu 10 Stunden hält. Die Formel mit natürlichen Fruchtextrakten und pflegenden Ölen ist vegan, tierversuchsfrei und in ganzen 36 (!) verschiedenen Nuancen erhältlich. Die revolutionäre Peel-off-Technologie sorgt zudem dafür, dass sich die Farbe an dein natürliches Lippenrot anpasst und einen individuellen Look kreiert, der auf dich zugeschnitten ist.

mov_FFB019DB46B10BAAA11CE6927D9A94FB,2025-06-15 14:00:57,en,WEB,"  Adolescence, education, and married life Nusrat Jahan Nazlee was born and raised in Dhaka, where her father held a prominent position in the Bangladesh Government. Due to his transfer to various districts, Nazlee spent her formative years in Dhaka, Chittagong, and Khulna. She showed a strong passion for drawing at early age, often utilising calendar pages as her canvas. Her class teacher appreciated her talent, and her peers used to eagerly wait for her next artistic creations. In addition to her drawing pursuits, she worked for dramas during the school's cultural programs and also engaged in various sports activities. She took her BA degree from a local college in Dhaka. Nazlee, a dedicated housewife, has carved out a segment of her daily routine for the pursuit of painting after fulfilling her family responsibilities. In addition to her passion for painting, she is also interested in interior decoration. She designed the interior of her elegant two-story home. Furthermore, she possesses a keen interest in landscape architecture. An accomplished cook, Nazlee's food presentation is truly commendable. Her father-in-law, Md Shamsul Haque, a former president of Beximco and later the founder of Shams Group, holds her in high regard. Nazlee is also skilled in cake-making, and her culinary creations and presentation are highly praiseworthy. During his travels abroad, her father-in-law thoughtfully brought back colour tubes of multiple shades, spatulas, brushes, and other materials essential for her painting endeavours. Nazlee's spouse, Md. Shamsul Huda, consistently motivates her to pursue her passion for painting. Upon the completion of each artwork, her husband is the first to view it and provide feedback. Nazlee believes that her journey as a painter would be significantly more challenging without the inspiration and support from her husband. Additionally, her brother-in-law, Md. Shamsu Zoha regularly brings her art materials whenever he travels abroad. Flowers Nazlee generally uses a large canvas to depict flowers and untamed nature. Losing herself in the natural world, the artist frequently takes themes from this affluent source and plays with shades and textures on canvas. She sometimes likes to experiment with diverse vague and plain forms, and enjoys breaking and constructing them in many ways. Blossoming and budding flowers as well as dense forests are recurring features in her paintings. In many of Nazlee's works, one finds a great interchange between abstract and realistic forms. As a nature admirer, Nazlee's focus is on colour and its various facets. She also experiments with unstructured forms and vague compositions, which are scrupulously used in her works. The artist has often applied colours directly piling up thick and at times thin layers on the canvas, thereby, producing bold and dynamic images. Strong brush strokes create textural vibes in her works which have not been intentionally done. Occasionally, she deliberately creates a texture according to the paintings' distinctive requirements. She concentrates more on the application aspect and this trait creates a personal hallmark for her creations.Boats of Bangladesh and riverine beauty Nature has consistently served as Nazlee's primary source of inspiration. She endeavours to establish a connection with the natural world. The artist perceives nature as an inexhaustible reservoir of beauty, enigma, and anonymity. Her exceptional ability lies in capturing the philosophical dimensions of nature, its form and colour, to evoke sensitive emotions. Nazlee has depicted various types of boats found in different regions of the country, skillfully illustrating the beauty of rivers and the charm of rural landscapes. Throughout her career, she has cultivated a distinctive style, particularly focused on these themes. She predominantly favours acrylic as her medium due to its clarity and expressiveness. Acrylic allows her to convey her creativity with ease. Many of her works feature dynamic brushstrokes. She possesses the determination and talent essential for transforming her visual perceptions of the world into an emotionally resonant expression. Recently, Nazlee has demonstrated her skill in capturing the nuances of light and shadow, particularly in her representations of nature that feature serene rivers with boats and tranquil surroundings. 1971 Nazlee is a passionate artist dedicated to depicting the significant events of our esteemed Liberation War and Language Movement. She has created numerous collage-based paintings that reflect these themes. Her artwork is intricately linked to the tumultuous period surrounding the nation's birth and highlights its pivotal moments in history. Through her paintings, she conveys a spectrum of emotions, including joy, love, and suffering. Elements such as the Language Movement of 1952, the six-point and eleven-point demands, Shaheed Minar, and letters written by Freedom Fighters are incorporated into her artworks...."

As Season 7 of Love Island USA continues to heat up on Peacock, OG Huda Mustafa is one Islander who is causing a lot of discourse on social media. After viewers opted to pair Mustafa's original beau, Jeremiah Brown, with Iris Kendall, as of the most recent episode, Mustafa recently turned on Brown, and things may have spiraled out of control. The North Carolina native is unleashing a wrath, with fans and fellow Islanders calling her “Hurricane Huda.” But who is Mustafa in calmer waters? Read on for everything we know about the reality star. She has a 4-year-old daughter As fans watched Mustafa (eventually) share with Brown, Mustafa has a 4-year-old daughter. According to Us Weekly, the reality TV star's mini-me is named Arleigh and was born in July 2020. Mustafa shares a daughter with ex Noah Sheline. Mustafa marked her daughter's fourth birthday on social media, sharing a sweet picture of the two sharing a kiss along with a heartfelt message about being a single mother. “To the girl who made me a mommy. if i could have a million of you, i would,” she shared in July 2024. “You give me purpose. you give me strength. you give me happiness. you give me unconditional love i never knew was possible. you gave me the love i needed. you give me laughs. you are my world. happiest of birthdays to my stinker. mommy loves you so much,” she wrote. Noah Sheline has defended Huda Mustafa against fan critiques Sheline did take to social media recently to defend Mustafa against harsh fan critiques about her behavior in the villa. He wrote in a TikTok story, “At the end of the day I hope everyone remembers we're human. Her going on that show to find love, or whatever you think it was she's doing, remember she's still human, she has a daughter, and a life.” He continued, “She's maybe not doing a great job idk I don't watch the show but I don't like that I'm seeing so much negative s**t on my page or even clips of it about her…It's not my job to police her or the people in my comments, but I will say what you guys do will affect her mental health and my daughter's maybe in the future…“So I'm looking out for her in that aspect. Out of respect for our daughter.” She's a fitness influencer and offers online coaching In addition to being a mother, Mustafa is also a fitness influencer and often shares videos of her workouts and health on socials. The plethora of gym inspiration she posts to Instagram and TikTok has garnered her hundreds of thousands of followers across platforms. She's also an online fitness coach and offers classes for those inspired by her health journey. Mustafa's website details different programs that provide fitness and nutritional guidance. “Redefine your reality with programs customized to your needs and lifestyle,” her website reads. She shares on the website that her goal is to make fitness approachable and fun for women. “My mission is to help other women reclaim their strength, confidence, and beauty, without losing themselves in the process,” she explains. “I've made it my goal to make fitness fun, approachable, and something that fits seamlessly into your life. The gym doesn't have to be intimidating, and no goal is too big or small when you have the right support.” She continues, “I specialize in helping women navigate both the weight loss and muscle-building journey, with an emphasis on feeling good in your own skin.”"

mov_DF8D0B56CC55F9BF2EE80F7255E5A08A,2025-06-20 18:02:10,en,WEB,"  Not sure where to apply blush? You're not alone. Despite being one of the buzziest makeup products in recent years, wearing blush can be confusing with all the different application trends and product formulations available. TikTok has helped hacks like W blush and sundae blush go viral, while brands are offering cream blush, liquid blush, and powder blush options. So, how do you figure out which product and method is right for you? First, it's important to focus on what blush is designed to achieve. According to Hayley Kassel, a makeup artist and beauty photographer who has worked on campaigns for Fenty Beauty and ColorPop, blush has a simple function. “Overall applying blush can add warmth, dimension, and a healthy glow to your face,” she says. In some instances, it can also function like contour or highlighter to sculpt the face. “If you want a lifted look, try placing blush above your cheekbones, closer to highlighter placement,” Kassel adds. Most important of all, blush is whatever you want it to be. The viral term “blush blindness,” used to describe a person wearing too much blush, isn't real. “I'm a bit of a blush enthusiast, if you will, so I love any sort of blush in any sort of way,” says Kassel. Ahead, we asks professional makeup artists everything you need to know about where to apply blush. Where should you apply blush? Your blush placement all depends on the look you're trying to achieve. Want a youthful flush? “Keep the blush more centered on the apples of your cheeks,” says Kassel. “You can also blend the blush downward for a very 'romantic renaissance' vibe.” For a more natural look, Kassel recommends using your fingers. “I love to dab the blush across the nose and chin to create a cohesive, sun-kissed glow,” she says.

I always start applying powder or cream blush, at the top back of the cheekbone and bring it forward, towards your nose,” says Luna. Once you've created a base blush, then you can go in with any additional product. “You can always finish any blush look by applying what's left on your brush, sponge or fingertips, on the bridge of your nose, forehead and chin, to bring your look together.” Courtesy of brand Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush $24 Amazon Huda Beauty Blush Filter Soft Glow Liquid Blush Bubblegum $32 Sephora Saie Dew Blush in Poppy $25..."
mov_38FFFA4A27D1A1266372E2CF3DF766B2,2025-06-20 18:30:10,en,WEB,"  The annual Cannes Lions festival, traditionally a showcase for established advertising agencies, is increasingly recognizing the power of a new breed of marketing professional: the influencer. Influencer marketing – leveraging individuals with a dedicated social media following to promote products or services – is no longer a peripheral tactic but a central component of modern advertising strategies. As one advertising executive noted from the Croisette, “Ignoring the influence of creators is simply not an option; it's arguably the most vibrant segment within the advertising landscape today.” A counter-Current in a Challenging Market while the broader advertising industry faces headwinds, the influencer marketing sector is demonstrating remarkable resilience and growth. Recent data from Statista projects a substantial 36% increase in brand investment in this area between 2024 and 2025, reaching a projected $33 billion. This surge reflects a broader shift in consumer behavior, with audiences increasingly turning to trusted individuals for recommendations rather than conventional advertising channels. Consider the rise of “de-influencing” on platforms like TikTok, where creators actively discourage unneeded purchases, highlighting a demand for authenticity that traditional advertising often struggles to meet. The Rise of User-Generated Content & Creator Revenue The impact extends beyond mere promotion. WPP Media reports that user-generated content (UGC) is now surpassing professionally produced advertising in volume and, increasingly, in effectiveness. This isn't simply about cost savings; it's about authenticity and relatability. Consumers are more likely to engage with content that feels genuine and reflects real-life experiences. WPP estimates that creator-driven revenue will reach $184.9 billion this year, a 20% jump from 2023. This figure encompasses not only sponsored content but also revenue generated through affiliate marketing, direct sales of merchandise, and platform monetization programs like YouTube's Partner Programme or TikTok's Creator Fund. Beyond Brand Partnerships: The Evolution of the Creator Ecosystem The creator economy is evolving beyond simple brand partnerships. We're seeing the emergence of specialized creator agencies, platforms designed to connect brands with relevant influencers (like aspireiq or Upfluence), and tools that empower creators to manage their businesses more effectively.Furthermore, the lines between influencer and entrepreneur are blurring. Many creators are launching their own brands, leveraging their established audiences to build triumphant businesses. Such as, beauty influencers like Huda Kattan (Huda Beauty) and Patrick Starrr (ONE/SIZE) have built multi-million dollar empires from their online presence. Challenges and Future Trends Despite the notable growth, the influencer marketing landscape isn't without its challenges. Concerns around clarity, authenticity, and the potential for misleading advertising remain. Regulatory bodies like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) are increasing scrutiny of influencer marketing practices, requiring clear disclosure of sponsored content. Looking ahead, several trends are poised to shape the future of the industry: Micro and Nano-Influencers: Brands are increasingly focusing on smaller, more niche influencers with highly engaged audiences. AI-Powered Influencers: The emergence of virtual influencers (CGI characters) raises questions about authenticity and the future of influencer marketing. the Metaverse & Virtual Worlds: Opportunities for influencer marketing are expanding into virtual environments like Roblox and Decentraland. Long-Term Partnerships: Moving away from one-off campaigns towards sustained collaborations between brands and creators. The creator economy is fundamentally altering the dynamics of advertising. brands that embrace this shift and prioritize authentic engagement with creators and their audiences will be best positioned to succeed in the evolving digital landscape.

Summer-ready styles in apparel and footwear—such as sundresses, skirts, shorts, cotton shirts, swimwear, flip flops and sandals—are seeing strong traction.Myntra said demand for these categories rose around 2.2 times year-on-year in March and April compared to the beginning of the year. Popular brands in this space include H&M, MANGO, Puma, Crocs, US Polo, Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas, Trendyol and Levi's. Standardised products readily available with convenient return options are likely to spur demand on quick commerce platforms like M-Now, Myntra's M-Express has already been popular with customers, delivering orders in one to two business days.Thus, expanding to Delhi-NCR and Mumbai region would open opportunities to tap urban consumers looking for quick deliveries.In FY24, Myntra posted a net profit of Rs 30.9 crore against revenue of Rs 5,173.7 crore.Rising competitionQuick commerce now accounts for 20% of India's ecommerce market and is growing at a rate of 50% annually, Walmart International chief executive Kathryn McLay said in May.

Companies such as Zepto are in advanced talks with Edelweiss Alternative Asset, domestic family offices and smaller credit funds for around Rs 1,500 crore structured debt.Blinkit had an annualised GOV of $3.6 billion in the quarter ended December 31, 2024. Swiggy Instamart posted an annualised gross sales run rate of $1.8 billion in the same quarter.As price becomes the primary differentiator for these apps with near-similar user experience, intense discounting and attendant cash burn are likely to intensify further, a recent report by ET highlighted.This month, average discounts across categories rose to 20–25% on maximum retail price compared to below 10% two years ago across various quick commerce platforms, including for segments like dairy and groceries, the sources said.

This service focuses on delivering clothes from premium brands. Customers can now get rapid delivery on items from Vero Moda, Mango, Calvin Klein, and more. Other fashion platforms like Ajio and Nykaa are also exploring ultra-fast delivery. Myntra has rolled out its ""M-Now"" 30-minute delivery service to Delhi-NCR and Mumbai, following a successful pilot in Bengaluru, a report has said. Unlike Blinkit, Zepto and other food-related quick commerce platforms, M-Now will specifically focus on delivering clothes, including from premium brands, in 30-minutes. Notably, Blinkit and Zepto also deliver some basic apparels such as tees and shorts. The M-Now service, first trialed in Bengaluru last December with around 10,000 SKUs, now offers collections from nearly 600 brands. Customers in the expanded zones can now get rapid delivery on items from popular names like Vero Moda, Mango, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Levi's and even luxury beauty and accessory brands such as Dyson, YSL, Prada, Carolina Herrera, and Huda Beauty, as per a report by The Economic Times.Myntra CEO Nandita Sinha had previously indicated the company's plans to bring the service to Mumbai, New Delhi and Pune. She noted a ""significant demand from fashion-first and trend-focused premium customers for quick deliveries."" Myntra's move is part of a larger trend in India's e-commerce landscape, where fashion platforms like Ajio and Nykaa, along with new-age brands such as Newme, Slikk and Blip, are all exploring ultra-fast delivery. This momentum was initially sparked by quick commerce pioneers like Blinkit, Instamart, and Zepto, who expanded beyond groceries to include fashion and apparel from brands like Jockey, Manyavar, Puma, and Adidas.The report also pointed out the challenges, saying that one key hurdle is customer behaviour. As per as Snitch founder Siddharth Dungarwal, while initial interest in fast delivery is high, shoppers often revert to purchasing only basic wardrobe essentials like black t-shirts or shirts through these services."

1lh7fdk,2025-06-21 21:33:16,en,REDDIT,"  To elaborate, I'm 16 years old, and I have terrible hyperpigmentation where my smile lines are. I don't have fine lines there. Right now, I go to a dermatologist and use tretinoin to lighten it. I attached a picture of what I look like. I'm sorry if I look greasy or shiny; I just did my skincare and I don't have any filter on. Whenever I put makeup on that area it creases where I smile. I feel like if I don't put on a lot of product it's not covering up the marks but then it creases. It looks like I'm trying way too hard and I feel so insecure. It takes me three hours to get ready and it's so annoying. I feel like crying after because it looks so terrible. I know that having your makeup crease is normal but I don't think it should be that obvious the moment I put makeup on. My morning skincare routine: Oil cleanser, foam cleanser, toner, moisturizer, and lastly sunscreen. I have combination skin and I wait 5-10 minutes before applying makeup so everything soaks in. The order I apply my makeup products: Huda Beauty color corrector in shade Peach, Haus Labs concealer in shade 31, Charlotte Tilbury setting spray, and finally the Laura Mercier loose longwear setting powder in shade Honey. I use brushes from amazon to blend it out. Is there a special technique I'm supposed to do? Any advice would be extremely helpful. Thank you so much!!"

4f8e49d32c3778b61d5cf7cf1158658d,2025-06-23 00:43:00,en,WEB,"  Topics Fans Are Attacking Love Island's Huda, But Her Best Support Is From A Surprising Source Love Island USA's Huda Mustafa has emerged this season as the most polarizing person in the cast, but she's getting support from an unlikely source: the father of her daughter, Arleigh Sheline. Part of the beauty of Love Island USA is that it's filmed and airs in near real time, meaning the things happening on current episodes are happening at the villa within a day or so of airing. There is very little delay, so audiences can follow along as things unfold, without needing to wait very long. The audience at home gets to see everything play out, but the Islanders aren't sure of what is airing and what people are seeing, or how they are coming across to audiences. The Islanders are cut off from all forms of communication as well, so oftentimes, their friends and family at home are defending them, or speaking for them, unbeknownst to the Islanders themselves. In Huda's case, Noah Sheline, the father of her 4-year-old daughter, has taken to social media to ask fans to be kinder to Huda. Huda's Love Island Stint Is Controversial Huda Is Due For A Redemption Arc From the moment They gleefully coupled up, and Huda revealed that she has a daughter at home after a few days at the villa together.Huda burst onto the scene on Love Island USA season 7 and laid her eyes on Jeremiah Brown, she was locked into a relationship with him. They coupled up quickly, and the love bombing that was apparent didn't feel like red flags to Huda or Jeremiah. Huda became very territorial over Jeremiah, which rubbed her fellow Islanders the wrong way. Huda would make jokes about how nobody could go near Jeremiah, and when she sensed Jeremiah was beginning to pull away, her anxious attachment style went into overdrive. Huda “crashing out” became something that might make her a target for mockery, as she's obviously a sensitive and emotional woman. Jeremiah cooled off on their relationship early on, but it was after he'd told her he loved kids and could see a future with her outside the villa. Huda may have exaggerated Jeremiah's emotions. However, he continued to feed into her misconceptions, ultimately making her look like she had trouble facing reality when she was simply reacting to him. Maybe Huda should have been voted off the island, but she still remains, hoping to find a connection with another man in the villa before her time runs out. Huda's Baby Daddy Noah Asked For Kindness Huda's Baby Daddy Supports Her As Mother Of His Child The father of Huda's daughter, Noah took to social media to ask fans to be more kind to Huda because he worries about her mental health when she leaves the villa and sees the reaction from the audience. Huda already has an idea that America might not be on her side, since they voted to separate her and Jeremiah, which sent Huda spiraling. Jeremiah has now coupled up with Iris Kendall, a new bombshell, and he chose Iris over Huda, which left her devastated. Related 20 Best Reality TV Shows Right Now Reality TV is more popular than ever. With so many to choose from, here are some of the best reality TV shows to stream or watch right now. Noah shared a message on his TikTok story, as per ZacharyReality, where he addressed his connection to Huda for the first time publicly. He claimed he wasn't watching the show, and had no intention of ever getting back with Huda, but he wanted her to be healthy for their daughter. Noah wrote: “remember that she's still human, she has a daughter, and a life.” He continued that, “what you guys do will affect her mental health and my daughters maybe in the future. So I'm looking out for her in that aspect. Out of respect for our daughter.” Huda Is Lucky To Have A Strong Support System Huda Needs All The Support She Can Get Huda is extremely lucky to have Noah in her corner. He could easily pile on, revealing things about their relationship that might paint her in an unflattering light. Instead, he took the high road and asked for sensitivity concerning Huda and her actions on the show. “I don't want my daughter's mom to get out and see this and her mental health goes down a hill,” he said, displaying a level of emotional maturity and kindness not often seen on social media or reality TV. “Just to clarify, I don't watch the show, I don't want to get back with her, I'm not gonna go on the show if they asked… Stop assuming things if you don't know me or her, it makes you seem dumb. About 90% are totally off on the negative stuff you comment about me. I can only imagine her page.” When Huda leaves the villa in a couple or alone, she will be exposed to comments that have been made about her while she's been in Fiji. It will most likely be upsetting for her, unless she gets a redemption arc. There are still a lot of episodes left to air, and Huda's story could go in an entirely new direction. Huda's been saved from elimination a few times, so there's clearly a desire to keep her on the show, perhaps to see her overcome her break-up or to provide more entertainment. Whatever happens to Huda, she's very lucky to have a man like Noah in her corner and as the father of her daughter. Noah seems like a stand-up guy and a good dad, and the fact that he's choosing to spread positivity instead of slinging mud is a sign of his good character. Huda has good taste in men, since she picked such a good one to have a child with, so hopefully she can find someone as good as Noah in the villa...."

mov_0FC305692DE6BB224F62A1C643C1A0E3,2025-06-27 17:32:37,en,WEB,"  “What you see is what you know, and all I ever saw growing up was women cooking. My parents were very against the idea of it becoming my career. My family doesn't drink or eat pork, and they worried I wouldn't be able to avoid those things in a professional kitchen. When it was time to go to college, I started out studying finance at Baruch College, but I landed an internship at Time Inc. during my freshman year. From there, every internship I had was in fashion, beauty, or media. Halfway through college, I realized I didn't have the experience—or interest—for a finance job, so I created an ad hoc major that blended communications, marketing, and journalism, with a minor in art. My first job out of school was at BuzzFeed. By then, I'd already started posting food videos on TikTok and was gaining some traction. BuzzFeed had a talent incubator program where you could create content, and after two months there, Bon Appétit food director Chris Morocco emailed me about an assistant food editor position that was opening up. I interviewed and got the job. Less than six months into Bon Appétit, I signed with a manager. I was feeling overwhelmed by influencer work, which had become a real—and lucrative—part of my life, and I didn't want to give it up. Pretty quickly, my team asked if I had any interest in doing a cookbook. I initially said no—it felt too soon—but they encouraged me to think it over. I did, and the book, Third Culture Cooking: Classic Recipes for a New Generation, took more than two years to make. If you're the child of immigrants—or come from a family that recently immigrated—the term third culture kid really resonates. For a long time, I couldn't make sense of the tension of being from two places. Both of my parents are of Indian descent, my grandma came from a farming family in East Africa, and I was raised in New Jersey. That in-between space is real, but different, and there's no blueprint for how to exist in it. So when I first heard the term, I felt an immediate sense of peace. It was like, Oh—I don't have to pick. I exist here. And that's enough. My cooking is third culture cooking. I'm not exclusively doing American classics, and I'm not strictly recreating my grandmother's recipes either. A term like fusion might sound similar, but it feels hollow and it lacks context. Third culture cooking has layers—there's history, storytelling, and meaning. BEAUTY I feel uniquely lucky to have always been surrounded by women. My mom is a hairdresser and aesthetician by trade, and I have two sisters. Seeing them interact with beauty made me feel like This is what girls do. This is a part of girlhood. Also, the idea of getting ready has always been part of my life. As someone who wears a scarf, there are a few steps before you head out the door—I have to put my scarf on, and if I'm doing that, I might as well put on some lip gloss. One of my sisters wears a scarf too, so she's my go-to for hair stuff because she's in the know. My other sister and I talk about skincare constantly, because when you're framing your face with a scarf, your skin is everything because that's all people see. SKINCARE The Drunk Elephant line was truly revelatory for me. I was maybe 18 when I discovered it, and a few of their products completely changed my skin. Their Beste cleanser is super soft on my skin—it's what I travel with because it removes anything left after my first cleanse with Sulwhasoo's cleansing oil. I also like the Youth To The People's and Kiehl's Ultra Facial cleansers. And if I want gentle physical exfoliation, Humanrace's Rice Powder is my go-to. My skin always looks smooth afterward, and makeup goes on beautifully. Another game-changer: I bought a 15-pack of washcloths and switch them out every night. For chemical exfoliation, I tone with Ren's Ready Steady tonic, usually in place of my Drunk Elephant T.L.C. Framboos serum, which has glycolic acid. And I've been using Tower 28's SOS spray for over a year—I can't travel without it. It has hypochlorous acid and helps calm my skin and reduce hormonal breakouts. And TikTok convinced me to try Beauty of Joseon's Revive eye serum, and I swear my eyes look brighter since I started using it. During the day, I like Drunk Elephant's C-Firma serum. I've tried the vitamin C from Skinceuticals, but like everyone says, it smells like hot dog water and was too much for me...."

urn:li:share:7345473082003722241,2025-06-30 15:27:35,en,LINKEDIN,"  Recently, Amazon's aggressive pricing had been called out as the primary factor impacting SEPHORA's online growth ambitions in the US. I delved deeper and data shows a more nuanced story. Turns out, Pricing is not Sephora's main struggle ! Some key highlights on the data - The share of beauty and personal care sales taking place online in the US, increased from 35% in 2023 to 39% in 2024. - Amazon's share in beauty and personal care e-commerce increased to 47% from 44% during this period. - Sephora, the second-largest online retailer for beauty and personal care in the US, experienced a slight market share dip from 10% in 2023 to 9% in 2024 despite growing value sales. - Color Cosmetics and Skin care collectively form nearly 70% of Sephora's online sales in the US, both categories experienced a decline in online sales. - Most top-performing brands in colour cosmetics, including Charlotte Tilbury, Rare Beauty, and Sephora, had higher average prices at Amazon compared to Sephora in 2024. Despite lower prices, these brands experienced sales declines on Sephora. - Charlotte Tilbury, continues to decline across both retailers. - In skin care, most brands posted growth on Amazon in 2024 despite higher average prices. While Laneíge, Sol de Janereiro, Claudalie and Tower 28 saw lower prices on Amazon, these brands performed well across both retailers, with higher share of sales made via Sephora online. ➖ Source: Euromonitor International Read on to know what really should matter more for Sephora and its peer retailers in today's e-commerce landscape : http://bit.ly/3TNr8U7 #brandstrategy #ecommerce #sephora #amazon Fortune #digital #beauty Huda Beauty Rare Beauty NARS Cosmetics TATCHA  Charlotte Tilbury Beauty"

Not much to say, it does the job! - The one hiding is a Decléor Cleansing Milk that I got as a freebie when the brand was discontinued. This breaks my heart because I looooved this product. - Tower 28 mini Daily Barrier Recovery Cream: loved it, worked out well for my oily skin. - Huda Beauty Easy Bake Setting Spray: I wanted to love it but you can see in the phone how messy the spray is, they need to rework the packaging for it to be a good product. As it is the mist just lands as blotches on your face. - Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm in Pink Sugar: loved it. But it took me six months of pretty regular use so I'm scared of the fact I have it in five other shades… - Laura Mercier Mini Caviar Stick Eye Shadow in shade Gilded: fantastic stick shadow. - Rare Beauty Perfect Strokes Volumizing Mascara (mini): I liked it but wouldn't get the mini again as it was difficult to apply without making a mess. - Ilia Fullest Volumizing Mascara (mini): Really good, and not an issue applying like the Rare Beauty one."

This expansion is significantly propelled by the growth of e-commerce and technological advancements that have revolutionized the industry. Consumers now have easier access to a diverse array of products, while brands can engage with a wider audience through digital channels. Innovations like augmented reality (AR) virtual try-ons have elevated the online shopping experience, allowing users to visualize products before purchase, thereby enhancing both convenience and personalization.

Beauty influencers and makeup artists leverage these platforms to share tutorials, product reviews, and new techniques, directly impacting purchasing decisions. Brands are increasingly utilizing social media for product launches, audience engagement, and the creation of viral trends to boost sales and cultivate brand loyalty. A notable trend in 2024 is the rapid growth of the men's grooming and skincare market, driven by evolving societal norms and the strong influence of platforms like TikTok, where hashtags such as #mensskincare have gained widespread popularity. This trend reflects a shifting perspective on masculinity, encouraging more men to adopt skincare and beauty routines, prompting brands to develop product lines specifically tailored for male consumers. Key Market Dynamics & Insights: Facial Color Cosmetics Dominance: In 2024, facial color cosmetics held a share of approximately 39.03% of the U.S. color cosmetics market. This is attributed to their fundamental role in daily beauty routines and the extensive range of products within this category.

1lozl9k,2025-07-01 11:49:54,en,REDDIT,"  Hello! I would really appreciate your help! I'm trying to build a simple, long-lasting base routine for both daily wear and small glam events. My skin is sensitive, acne-prone, and combination, so I really need something that: * Doesn't clog pores or break me out * Feels lightweight and comfortable * Lasts all day (I'm usually out from 6:30 AM to 7:30 PM, with gym after work — I can wash my face before the gym to remove makeup, but sometimes it's a hassle. That said, I'd rather have healthy skin, and the weather in my region is extremely hot in the summer and very cold in the winter) * I will be using that one product all over my face thinly for when I have events and such, but I only do that when there is something going on which is maximum 12 times a year and maybe even less. * Is actually worth the money (no fading, caking, or separating) **Budget for makeup:** I'd rather avoid expensive products that break the bank, but I'm willing to spend if it's something I'll truly use and not regret buying. I will be using that single product for a year or two, depending on its shelf life. Right now, I'm looking at these (ChatGPT suggested them, lol): # Base * [Dior Forever Skin Correct Concealer](https://www.dior.com/en_us/beauty/products/dior-forever-skin-correct-Y0326000.html) * [Tower 28 Swipe Serum Concealer](https://www.tower28beauty.com/products/swipe-serum-concealer) * [NARS Soft Matte Complete Foundation](https://www.narscosmetics.com/USA/soft-matte-complete-foundation/999NAC0000112.html) * [Haus Labs Triclone Skin Tech Concealer](https://www.hauslabs.com/products/triclone-skin-tech-concealer) * [Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear Concealer](https://www.lancome-usa.com/makeup/face-makeup/concealers/teint-idole-ultra-wear-all-over-full-coverage-concealer/00422-LAC.html) * [Lancôme Teint Idole Ultra Wear Foundation (2023)](https://www.lancome-usa.com/makeup/face-makeup/foundation/teint-idole-ultra-wear-foundation/00716-LAC.html) * [NARS Light Reflecting™ Foundation](https://www.narscosmetics.com/USA/light-reflecting%E2%84%A2-advanced-skincare-foundation/999NAC0000141.html) * [NARS Natural Radiant Longwear Foundation](https://www.narscosmetics.com/USA/natural-radiant-longwear-foundation/999NAC0000065.html) * [Natasha Denona Hy-Glam Concealer](https://natashadenona.com/products/hy-glam-concealer) * [Shiseido Synchro Skin Self-Refreshing Foundation](https://international.shiseido.co.jp/products/shiseido-synchro-skin-self-refreshing-foundation-1012176130SHI.html) * [Estée Lauder Double Wear Stay-in-Place Foundation](https://www.esteelauder.com/product/643/22830/product-catalog/makeup/face/foundation/double-wear/stay-in-place-foundation) # Blush & Setting Powder * [Huda Beauty Mini “Baby Bake” Easy Bake Loose Setting Powder](https://hudabeauty.com/us/en_US/powder-and-setting-spray/baby-bake-easy-bake-loose-powder-mini-banana-bread-HB01420.html) * [Laura Mercier Translucent Loose Setting Powder Ultra-Blur Mini](https://www.lauramercier.com/products/translucent-loose-setting-powder-ultra-blur-mini) * [Tower 28 BeachPlease Lip + Cheek Cream Blush](https://www.tower28beauty.com/products/beachplease-luminous-tinted-balm-blush) * [e.l.f.

Or is there something better I should get instead (especially for the price)? I've tried Estée Lauder Double Wear from my mom and loved how it looked (even though her bottle is 6+ years old, lol).

643036D9764BDB3BD8714AA12B0943BD,2025-07-04 02:29:59,en,PRINT,"  New Delhi, July 4 -- India's copycat economy is coming under pressure as global brands are starting to fight back. On Tuesday the Delhi High Court revived a long-pending lawsuit by American shoemaker Crocs Inc. against brands such as Bata, Liberty and Relaxo for copying its signature clog shoe design. The case, filed in 2014, had been pending for years before the court revived it this week. While the Crocs suit targets physical retailers, the copycat challenge for global brands has also moved online. Lookalike products that were once confined to local markets or grey channels are easily available on major e-commerce platforms. Some of these copies fall into the category of ""dupes"", which imitate the style of high-end products without logos and often remain in a legal grey zone, but others cross into counterfeiting by replicating trademarks. Digital marketplaces are flooded with lookalikes. A Rs.2-lakh Hermes sandal copy is listed for Rs.599 on one platform while replicas of Tory Burch handbags appear on another. Knockoffs of Marc Jacobs sling bags are available, too. You can also buy a replica of an Rs.18,000 Labubu doll-created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung-for less than Rs.1,000. Industry executives said this pointed to a growing ""dupe economy"" in India, where platforms host products en masse that mimic global designs, while mostly avoiding legal consequences. French brand Longchamp's signature nylon totes have inspired lookalikes at a leading retail chain and Birkenstock-style cork sandals, priced at Rs.5,000-8,000, are being sold for as little as Rs.1,000 online. Social media is driving much of this demand, with influencers on platforms such as Instagram and YouTube frequently showcasing budget versions of high-end goods, contributing to the sales growth of lookalike products. Abhay Gupta, founder of Delhi-based consultancy Luxury Connect, said, ""The explosion of social media platforms and dominant e-commerce sites has made it nearly impossible to track the spread of luxury fakes and dupes. It's threatening the luxury industry's integrity, discouraging genuine buyers, and diluting brand value. We need stricter intellectual property enforcement and strong action against these platforms. A unified industry voice along with platform accountability is crucial."" Gupta said India is becoming an important luxury market and such practices could dilute its global credibility. ""When mass platforms allow lookalikes of Hermes or Coach to flourish, they send a dangerous message-that originality is optional. If India wants to be taken seriously in the luxury ecosystem, we need sharper policing, better consumer awareness, and greater platform responsibility,"" he said. According to data available online, more than 64% of the world's fake luxury goods are produced in China. In 2021, counterfeit goods accounted for $467 billion in global trade. In India, a 2023 report by ASSOCHAM said 5% of all luxury apparel sold was counterfeit. Amazon said last week that its global Counterfeit Crimes Unit has helped secure over $180 million in court-ordered penalties and prosecuted more than 65 individuals worldwide since 2020, including in India. ""That said, people buying fakes were probably never the customers of the original,"" said Neelesh Hundekari, partner at global consultancy Kearney, who specialises in retail and luxury. ""But if they buy [fakes] out of aspiration, they may become future [genuine] buyers. Most genuine buyers are generally aware of where they can buy originals, but if there aren't enough genuine channels available then these buyers may also end up being cheated."" In mid-June Mint was able to find fakes of several luxury and high-end brands such as Saint Laurent and Tory Burch handbags on Amazon India in mid June. These were priced around Rs.7,000-well below the price of the original products. We sent several queries about this to Amazon on 18 June, to which it said it operates as a third-party marketplace where sellers list and sell products in accordance with applicable laws and selling policies. A spokesperson said, ""We have a zero tolerance policy for counterfeit products and continuously monitor our marketplace. We act quickly to protect customers and brands, including removing counterfeit listings and blocking accounts. We have several brand protection programs under which we collaborate with brands to protect our customers from bad actors attempting to abuse our marketplace."" Some listings were removed after we sent the queries, but new ones have since surfaced with slightly altered brand names. FirstCry, which was advertising fake Labubu dolls through Instagram ads until late last month, did not respond to Mint's queries.The listings were later taken down. Meesho declined to comment on specific products but said its Project Suraksha initiative has multiple strategies to tackle counterfeits and educate sellers. A spokesperson for Myntra said the platform ensures only authorised brands are listed, and has strict systems in place to check authenticity. However, it added that design decisions rest with the brands themselves. Swati Sharma, partner and head of intellectual property at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said India's laws do provide protection against counterfeit goods and misleading listings, but enforcement remains weak and reactive. ""Products that copy a luxury brand's design or logo qualify as counterfeits,"" she said. . She added that courts have taken a strict view in such cases, holding marketplaces accountable when they have promoted or enabled the sale of such products and granting remedies including injunctions, raids, seizures and damages. Despite these challenges, several global luxury brands have secured legal victories in India in recent months. In 2024 the Delhi High Court barred two businessmen from selling fake Louis Vuitton goods through platforms 'Mr. Shoes' and 'Mr. Retail,' ruling they had misused the brand's name. In June, Huda Beauty obtained an injunction against Vision Enterprises, which had imported 28,368 counterfeit cosmetics intercepted at Kolkata Port. Noida-based intellectual property lawyer Safir Anand of Anand & Anand said influencers who promote lookalike products could also face legal consequences. ""Such practices erode brand value, betray consumer trust, and are not protected under law,"" he said. He added that even if influencers don't claim a product is original, promoting it as a cheaper version can still amount to ""passing off"" and may thus violate IP laws. ""There's been a big rise in takedown notices,"" Anand said. ""Luxury brands are stepping up legal action, with quicker trials and stricter enforcement...."

On the current seventh season of the popular reality dating show, Madix, 40, seriously stepped up her game for her second round as host. Her looks have been more wide-ranging than ever, shocking fans with jaw-dropping hair color transformations and super-sexy ensembles. Hairstylist tells PEOPLE that he knew Madix would be a ""chameleon"" this season. ""The main goal was to make it completely different from last year. Every episode had to feel fresh,"" he says of preparing for filming the series in Fiji. ""We injected a bit of edge, some '90s references, girly vibes, high-fashion moments and sexy looks,"" Bembridge explains. ""One thing I've noticed is that we've played with a lot more curly and wavy hairstyles this time around, especially that mermaid texture. I actually told Ariana, 'This is giving , [the 1984 film] with Daryl Hannah,' so I nicknamed her Mer-Madix."" In order to achieve the roster of looks he'd dreamed up, the hairstylist packed accordingly. ""I brought three suitcases and one of them was completely full of hairpieces: wigs, clip-ins, bangs, different lengths, different shades,"" he shares. ""So in total, around came with me. My girls have to have options!"" Aside from Madix's beachy, mermaid-inspired waves, the star has rocked a dramatic brunette wig, a Rapunzel-like braid and piece-y bangs — and the season is not over yet. For makeup artist , her creations are a collaborative effort between other members of the glam team and Madix herself. ""Most of it came together on the day,"" Dawn tells PEOPLE. ""We'd see what [Ariana] was wearing, chat about what vibe she felt like. Sometimes she'd have inspo pics, and then we'd match it up with the hair look, too. If her hair was pulled back, we might do a winged eye; if she had a fringe, we'd keep it fresh and focus more on blush and lips."" When it comes to preserving Madix's makeup in the scorching island heat, Dawn says good skin prep and a solid base are crucial. ""I've been using the Milk Hydro Grip Primer, sometimes the original and sometimes the illuminating one for extra glow. For foundation, NARS and Haus Labs have been real heroes — they hold up way better on Ariana's skin than what we used last year. Huda Beauty's new setting spray is a game-changer too."" Surprisingly, Dawn doesn't use a lot of powder to combat sweat and shine. ""We don't like her skin to look overly matte or cakey, so I keep powder really minimal,"" she explains. ""Just a light dusting near the end, and then a final mist of setting spray right before she goes on. There's no heavy baking. Once she's out there for hours, you sometimes just have to trust the prep — so far, so good!"" Because stylist isn't on set with Madix in Fiji, she has to be bit more meticulous about her planning (she says she sent the host off with three checked suitcases full of clothes!) . ""We have a big fitting in the week before she leaves to try everything on and decide what we like and don't like,"" she explains. ""Then, I accessorize everything and pair each outfit with jewelry, shoes, undergarments — all the things! I try to consider every detail and angle for each outfit, even down to her nails."" The stylist has been loving press-ons for their versatility, and so she can switch Madix's nails with every look. Men adds that she personally tailors all of Madix's clothes and ensures everything fits perfectly at a second fitting before she leaves for filming. ""If any last-minute adjustments need to be made, we are so lucky to have the on-set wardrobe team of , and , who are amazing and able to sort out any last-minute issues! "" Never miss a story — sign up for  to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. While she and Madix always prepare mood boards based on what's inspiring them, Men says that confidence is always an underlying theme. ""Ariana and I work so well together because she is open to trying anything and everything,"" says the stylist. ""She is so comfortable in her own skin that she can effortlessly pull off so many different looks, and that confidence really shines through."" ""Also, you have to give a lot of credit to her amazing glam team, Carl Bembridge and Krystal Dawn — we all work together on these looks and make sure each component complements the others!"""

I'm a bit of a homebody, but will probably leave later today to use my free birthday Emagine theater ticket and see Bride Hard. At least that's the plan. So happy holiday weekend, even if 'Independence' day seems to be a stretch lately (check out the shirt at left here). As I think I've stated before, high school graduation season is no joke. I've spent the last several Sunday mornings either preparing for graduation parties or college orientation visit, taking the younger one to camp, recovering from a graduation party at our house, and even sneaking in a breakfast with out of town friends. It's been a month, but now I'm back to post with Kimberly at the Caffeinated Reviewer for Sunday Post, and Deb at Readerbuzz for Sunday Salon. And I need to say that I really missed my slow, reflective Sunday mornings sitting right here, saying what really doesn't feel like a lot, but is a spilling of my words. Even if who I am is often a response to my kids, family, and work. None of them oversee this - it's me. What I'm reading this week: As part of this great, at-home, doing me stuff weekend, I finished two books yesterday, reviewed two, and started two more. My reviews for The Athena Protocol (which published years ago, and I finished reading weeks ago) and Into the Leopard's Den (published on Tuesday, July 1, 2025, and apparently the last in the much-loved Bangalore Detectives Club series) were written yesterday and will be publishing to Books I Think You Should Read soon. While I finished Reading Into the Leopard's Den yesterday on my kindle, I also finished Funny Story by Emily Henry. That was my first read of the four adult Battle of the Books contest reads for mid-August. Our local library does a super-fun trivia contest on four pre-announced books at a local bar/restaurant. The first one was postponed from April 2020 until summer of 2023, and our team/book club (formed in January 2020 for the purpose of this contest) WON! Last year I think we came in third by just a couple points. This year, 3 out of 5 of our members from our championship year are not available, so the two remaining have added one of my co-workers, and the other team member's sister. The other three books are Huda F Are You? by Huda Fahmy, Escape! : The Story of the Great Houdini by Sid Fleischman, and The Lost City of the Monkey God by Doulas Preston. So I finished the pop fiction, started the kids' book, and still have the graphic novel and non-fiction to go. Wish us luck! I'm currently reading the print copy of Escape! : The Story of the Great Houdini and Fog and Fury by Rachel Howzell Hall on my kindle. Three Good Things: I think Deb started '3 Good Things' during COVID lockdowns, but I'm still all in too. More good news is always good :) We spent a few days at Northern Michigan University, where our daughter will attend in the fall, for new student (and support person) orientation. It was a fabulous event. She stayed in a dorm room with another incoming freshman, learned her way around campus a bit, met her suite-mates and a bunch of other new students, and even got to do an off-campus hike to see the beauty of the area. We're more sure than ever that she's made the right choice and is gonna love the next step in her life. Actually, this weekend so far has been a good thing :) I love staying home, reading, building LEGO, puttering/cleaning/improving my surroundings, a bit of coloring, watching movies with the kids.... Our son and I even had steak dinner Friday night. It's really been my optimal weekend off.I'm reading more books lately. What that actually means to me is that I'm focusing and checking things off, not just vegging out and sleeping as much as possible. It's a good thing. Three Goals for this week/month/whatever: While our son's closet re-org/design is done and he's working on putting it, and his whole room, in a better place, I've also found the motivation to work on my home office. And I've made noticeable progress! My goal is to have room for a table in here, so I can do my LEGO without stray pieces being at risk of being in someone's way. Cleaning out part of my office has already unearthed three brand-new water bottles (I think they have company logos, which reminds me I'd rather have an actual RAISE than another 'free' water bottle, but I digress). Anyway, I'd like to clean out a couple kitchen cupboards which will give me a box of similar items to donate. And get them out of my house!The kids and I have been wanting to re-do the curio cabinets. I have two of my grandmother's old curio cabinets in our 'formal' dining room (with an old table where I've been doing LEGO). While there is memorable stuff in them, we'd like to update it with stuff that is currently meaningful to us. It's on the list. Hope you're having a summer you're enjoying :)"

7fa5058fd25bf6c3ae9778b67a19c9d2,2025-07-07 07:24:00,en,WEB,"  GCC Cosmetics Market Size To Worth USD 14.40 Billion by 2033 | CAGR of 6.0% 07-07-2025 08:56 AM CET | Business, Economy, Finances, Banking & Insurance Press release from: IMARC Group GCC Cosmetics Market GCC Cosmetics Market Overview Market Size in 2024: USD 8.50 Billion Market Size in 2033: USD 14.40 Billion Market Growth Rate 2025-2033: 6.0% According to IMARC Group's latest research publication, ""GCC Cosmetics Market Size, Share, Trends and Forecast by Product Type, Category, Gender, Distribution Channel, and Country, 2025-2033"", the GCC cosmetics market size was valued at USD 8.50 billion in 2024. Looking forward, IMARC Group estimates the market to reach USD 14.40 billion by 2033, exhibiting a CAGR of 6.0% from 2025-2033. Download a sample PDF of this report: https://www.imarcgroup.com/gcc-cosmetics-market/requestsample Growth Factors in the GCC Cosmetics Market ● Rising Disposable Income The GCC region, especially the UAE and Saudi Arabia, has seen an increase in disposable income. This growth drives the cosmetics market forward. As people earn more, they spend more on luxury beauty products. They look for high-quality formulas and attractive packaging. This economic boom draws global brands like L'Oréal and Estée Lauder to the area. These brands serve the expanding middle and upper classes. Duty-free shops at Dubai and Riyadh airports have seen a rise in high-end cosmetics sales. Consumers are keen to invest in products that enhance their looks and confidence. ● Increasing Consumer Awareness Awareness of personal grooming and wellness is boosting demand for cosmetics in the GCC. Influencers share products and routines, influencing preferences. Many people now prefer skin health products, like vitamin C serums. A key example is the ""Gen Z's Skincare Evolution in GCC: Unfiltered"" report by Chalhoub Group and Meta. ● Expanding Working Women Population More women are joining the workforce in Saudi Arabia and the UAE. This change is boosting growth. More women are entering professional roles, creating a higher demand for cosmetics that support a polished look. For example, Saudi Arabia saw a rise in female labor force participation in 2024. This boosted the need for long-lasting makeup and skincare for busy schedules. Brands like Huda Beauty have taken advantage of this trend. They offer products designed for professional women, such as durable foundations and lipsticks. This focus has helped the market grow significantly. Key Trends in the GCC Cosmetics Market ● Demand for Natural and Organic Products Consumers in the GCC are seeking natural, organic, and eco-friendly cosmetics. Their concerns about synthetic ingredients and the environment drive this trend. Brands like Asteri, a Saudi-based company, have gained popularity by offering vegan makeup. They use local ingredients like moringa and date seed oil. This trend fits a broader shift toward sustainable living. Many consumers now give high rankings to cruelty-free and ethically sourced products. Retailers are responding by expanding their clean beauty lines. They ensure their formulations are free from harmful chemicals. This approach resonates with health-conscious buyers across the region. ● Growth of E-Commerce and Social Media Influence E-commerce and social media have changed the GCC cosmetics market. Products are now easier to find, and brands gain more visibility. Platforms like Instagram and YouTube influence buying decisions through endorsements and tutorials. For instance, Sisley Paris launched an e-commerce channel for GCC countries in 2021. This channel offers easy access to its luxury products...."
n1tmsj9,2025-07-07 15:31:36,en,REDDIT,"  I really like the Nyx skin tint with spf. BUT. A skin tint with spf WILL NOT give you enough spf protection throughout the day. You need to apply 1/4 teaspoon of spf on your face and neck. But I love it as a skin tint regardless of the spf. I just don't want people to think that they're getting protection bc of it. I have an Ilia one and this smokes it performance wise. I've converted to the One/Size setting powder. I've tried Elf, L'Oreal, Huda, Hourglass, Laura Mercier (one of the worst for a cakey finish) and O/S or Kimchi (I think they're mostly online) give me the best and longest wear. I like Huda a lot, but it doesn't give me all day. You can get the sample sizes that will last forever to try them out. Halo glow is gorgeous on the skin but looks weird on my forehead... I don't know how to describe it other than that lol. I don't recall wear time on it. For bronzer. . I love the liquid Mario one. I'm kinda meh on his other products but love that. I recently got the Nyx one and she's great too, but you just have to be so careful to not over apply bc it is so pigmented it ends up being a lot of work. LOVE Juvias place for a matte bronzer. I'm very pale and it is one of the few bronzers that really works for me. (the Nyx fairest shade is orange, so I did have to go second lightest to get a bronzed color). Blush... Can't go wrong with elf! I also love the Juvias place liquids (especially their blush lighter) but it's like Rare Beauty pigmented lol. If you want to go online I love all things Moira as well. Maybelline Sky High is my favorite, with Tarte tubing (purple bottle) a close second. I rotate between the two pretty frequently. I'm 43, so the trick with concealer is less is more. Do not swipe it on your face like a lot of influencers do. I dab it on the back of my hand, then use the tiny sponges From real techniques to apply. Let it dry, pat out any creases, then set with powder. Eyeshadow. . Colourpop and Nyx are great. I'm very hooded and oily. I prime, powder, eyeshadow, bake, then top with a sparkly shade. Get crazy long wear since I started baking my first layer of shadow. Put it on heavy since the bake will lighten the color. I like the Mac primer (not the pots... Zero stars on the pots), Thank Me Later by Elizabeth Mott (cheap on Amazon) and Urban Decay in that order. Okay I wrote a novel. If you only take one thing from this... Sunscreen. Sunscreen sunscreen sunscreen. 1/4 tsp. You just keep rubbing it til it works into your skin. I actually don't prime after and it has been working well for me."

The milestone celebration coincides closely with a historic moment in global commerce today: in June of 1974, the very first product was scanned using a GS1 barcode in a supermarket in Ohio, USA. What began as a simple scan of a pack of chewing gum sparked a revolution in how the world tracks, sells, and understands products. Today, GS1 UAE stands at the forefront of that same legacy — helping businesses in the UAE digitize, standardize, and future-proof their operations.

In the healthcare sector, GS1 UAE has partnered with health authorities such as Dubai Health, Emirates Drug Establishment,and Emirates Health Services,as well as hospitals such as Cleveland Clinic Abu Dhabi,and manufacturer associations such as Mecomed and Pharmag to implement serialization and traceability systems that strengthen patient safety, combat counterfeiting for pharmaceuticals and facilitate unique identification for medical devices.

[CMN 특별취재팀] 대한화장품산업연구원은 최근 발간한 글로벌 코스메틱 포커스 4호 인도, 인도네시아편에서 “(K-뷰티는) 마케팅 측면에서 현지화 전략을 통해 현지 소비자에게 친숙함을 어필하는 것이 필요하다”고 강조했다.
K-뷰티는 인도 소비자들 사이에서 여전히 트렌디하고 선망의 대상으로 인식되고 있다. 뚜렷한 포인트 메이크업을 선호하던 트렌드가 투명하고 맑은 피부 표현, 은은한 블러셔, 연한 컨투어링 등 자연스러운 한국식 메이크업으로 이동했다.
기미나 잡티 없이 유리처럼 맑고 매끄러운 피부를 연상시키는 한국식 스킨케어도 인기다. 얼굴, 모발, 입술 등 전반적인 피부관리에 한국산 화장품을 선호하는 추세다.
이처럼 K-뷰티의 영향력은 여전하지만 인도 로컬 브랜드들은 소비자들의 수요에 기반한 제품을 개발하고, 유통 채널을 다변화하면서 시장의 주도권을 강화하고 있다. 인도 정부도 신규 브랜드 프로그램과 같은 다양한 지원 사업을 통해 현지 화장품 산업 성장을 뒷받침하고 있다.
K-뷰티, 인도 주류 트렌드로 부상
K-뷰티의 글로벌 확산에 따라 인도에서도 그 영향력은 뚜렷하게 감지되고 있다. 과거 인도 뷰티 시장은 윤곽 강조, 도톰한 입술, 각진 눈썹과 같은 뚜렷한 포인트 메이크업 중심의 서구 스타일이 주를 이뤘다.
그러나 최근에는 K-뷰티 특유의 투명하고 맑은 피부 표현, 은은한 블러셔, 연한 컨투어링 등 자연스러운 메이크업으로 미적 기준이 이동하고 있다.
K-뷰티는 스킨케어 방법에도 영향을 미쳤다. 한국 뷰티의 핵심인 레이어링(Layering) 개념이 인도 소비자들 사이에서 확산돼 예전보다 더 많은 단계의 스킨케어 루틴이 일상화됐고, 이로 인해 인도 시장에서 화장품의 사용량과 카테고리 자체가 확대됐다. 이와 같은 변화는 단지 한국 화장품의 인기 상승에 그치지 않고 현지 기업들의 제품 개발, 브랜드 및 유통업체의 마케팅 전략에도 영향을 미치고 있다.
인도 배우 카리나 카푸어 칸(Kareena Kapoor Khan)과 슈가 코스메틱스(Sugar Cosmetics)의 공동 창업자 비네타 싱(Vineeta Singh)이 함께 론칭한 K-뷰티 콘셉트 기반의 스킨케어 브랜드 퀜치 보타닉스(Quench Botanics)가 대표적인 사례다. 이 브랜드는 메이드 인 코리아를 전면에 내세우며 쌀뜨물, 유자, 대나무 등 한국산 자연 유래 성분을 활용한 제품을 한국에서 생산해 인도에서 판매하고 있다.
나이카는 지난 4월 25일부터 27일까지 아모레퍼시픽 데이를 개최해 라네즈, 이니스프리, 에뛰드 등의 대규모 마케팅 캠페인을 전개했고, 인도 뷰티 플랫폼 카인드라이프(Kindlife)는 올해 자국 내 뷰티 트렌드를 반영하기 위해 K-뷰티 브랜드 유치에 본격적으로 나설 것이라고 밝히기도 했다.
럭셔리 뷰티 제품 수요 급증
커니(Kerney)의 2024년 9월 리포트에 따르면, 인도 럭셔리 뷰티 시장은 아직 초기 단계에 머물러 있어 구조적 성장 여력이 크다. 전체 뷰티 시장에서 럭셔리 제품이 차지하는 비중은 불과 4%로 태국, 베트남, 말레이시아와 같은 아시아 개발도상국의 20~25% 점유율에 비해서도 현저히 낮은 수준이다.
하지만 최근 인도의 럭셔리 뷰티 부문이 대중적인 뷰티 시장보다 두 배 빠른 속도로 성장하고 있으며, 미래 전망도 밝다.
글로벌 럭셔리 뷰티 브랜드들은 인도를 차세대 성장 동력으로 주목하며 적극적인 시장 공략에 나서고 있다. 이러한 흐름은 이미 수년 전부터 이어져 왔지만, 2025년에는 보다 구체적이고 전략적인 진출 사례들이 잇따라 등장하고 있다.
프랑스 명품 브랜드 샤넬(Chanel)은 2025년 5월 기준 총 7개의 부티크 매장을 운영하고 있으며 인도 내 입지를 강화하기 위해 뷰티 플랫폼 나이카(Nykaa)와 파트너십을 체결했다. 2025년 말까지 인도 전역에 위치한 10개 이상의 오프라인 매장으로 유통망을 확대할 계획이다.
일본 시세이도 그룹의 메이크업 브랜드 나스(NARS)도 2025년 나이카를 통해 인도 온라인 뷰티 시장에 공식 진출했다.
입생로랑(YSL)도 2024년 7월에 나이카를 통해 인도에 첫 진출했으며, 같은 해 11월에는 남인도 내 첫 오프라인 매장을 개점했다.
인도 소매업체 릴라이언스 리테일(Reliance Retail)의 옴니채널 뷰티 전문점 티라(Tira)는 인도 럭셔리 뷰티 시장을 본격적으로 공략해 2024년 11월 뭄바이(Mumbai)에 위치한 최고급 쇼핑몰 지오 월드 플라자(Jio World Plaza)에 플래그십 매장을 오픈했다.
위조 및 유해 화장품 단속 강화
불법 화장품 문제에 대응하기 위해 인도 당국은 2023년부터 '사운다라야(Soundarya) 작전'이라는 이름으로 대규모 단속을 진행해왔다.
이 과정에서 라끄메(Lakme), 로레알(L'Oral), 후다 뷰티(Huda Beauty), 메이블린(Meybelin)을 모방한 위조품이 적발된 적 있다.
인도 정부는 2025년에도 인도 전 지역에서 불법 화장품 유통에 대한 대대적인 수사와 단속을 진행했다.
2025년 1월 인도 서부 최남단 해안에 위치한 케랄라(Kerala)주에서는 70만 루피(한화 약 1,120만 원) 규모의 유해 화장품이 적발됐다. 이번 단속으로 33개 업체가 적발돼 법적 조치가 진행 중이다. 압수된 립스틱과 페이셜 크림 샘플에서는 수은 함유량이 법정 기준치보다 최대 1만 2,000배 높게 검출되는 충격적인 결과가 나타났다.
지난 3월 말에는 인도 국세청 산하 조세 정보국(DRI)이 해외에서 밀반입된 중국발 대규모 위조 화장품 컨테이너를 적발했다. 내용물이 신고 품목과 전혀 다른 가짜 화장품으로 확인됐다.
위인도표준국(BIS)은 2025년 3월 델리에 위치한 글로벌 유통업제조 및 불량 화장품 단속의 일환으로, 2025년 3월에 아마존(Amazon)과 현지 대형 전자상거래 플랫폼 플립카트(Flipkart)의 창고를 급습해 각각 8만 1,561달러(한화 약 1억 1,205만 원)와 7,000달러(한화 약 962만 원) 상당의 품질 기준 미달 상품을 압수했다.
이에 따라 정품 유통망 식별을 위해 전자로고(e-log)를 도입한 샤넬의 디지털 기반 위조 방지 시스템 강화 사례처럼, 뷰티 브랜드들은 각자의 방법으로 대응에 나서고 있다.
로컬 뷰티 브랜드 생태계 확장
인도 화장품 시장은 경쟁력 있는 로컬 브랜드들이 두각을 나타내며 새로운 성장 국면을 맞이하는 모습이다. 실제 소비자들의 수요에 밀착한 제품 개발과 유통채널 다변화를 통해 인도 토종 브랜드들이 화장품 시장의 주도권을 확장하고 있다.
2004년 설립된 컬러바(Colorbar)는 2025년 5월 기준 100개 이상의 직영 매장과 쇼퍼스 스톱(Shoppers Stop), 라이프스타일(Lifestyle) 등의 주요 소매점을 통해 1,200개 이상의 매장에 입점해 있다. 2025년까지 수익을 두 배로 늘려 100억 루피(약 1,400억 원) 이상을 달성할 것으로 전망하며, 2027년 초 기업공개(IPO)를 계획 중이다.
대표적인 인도 뷰티 브랜드 라끄메(Lakm)는 인구 구조와 소비 트렌드 변화에 대응해 '미니스(Minis)'라 불리는 소형 패키지 제품군에 주력하고 있다. 소용량 제품은 합리적인 가격, 휴대 편의성, 저렴한 가격으로 다양한 체험을 할 수 있기 때문에 Z세대 소비자층에서 강한 지지를 얻고 있다.
인도는 전체 인구의 약 65%가 35세 이하로 젊은층의 비중이 압도적인 국가인 만큼, 다양한 제품을 부담없이 시도하고 싶어하는 젊은 소비자층을 타깃으로 삼았다.
인도 메이크업 브랜드 매트룩 코스메틱(Mattlook Cosmetics) 또한 디지털 네이티브 세대를 공략하고 있다.
2025년 2월부터 퀵커머스 플랫폼 스위기 인스타마트(Swiggy Instamart)와의 제휴를 통해 10분 이내에 메이크업 제품을 배송해주는 혁신적인 배송 서비스를 제공하며 옴니채널을 구축했다.
지난 3월, 에스티로더 컴퍼니즈(ELC)는 인도상공업부(Ministry of Commerce and Industry)와 정부 주도 창업 지원 플랫폼 스타트업 인디아(Startup India)와 양해각서(MOU)를 체결했다.
뷰티앤유 인디아(BEAUTY&YOU India) 프로그램을 통해 현지 유망 스타트업을 발굴 및 지원할 예정이다.
인기 스킨케어 제품 분석
2025년 2월 3주차부터 5월 1주차까지 인도 아마존의 스킨케어 상위 10개 인기 제품을 분석한 결과, 클렌징 제품과 선케어 제품의 강세가 두드러졌다.
특히, 선케어 제품의 경우, 2월 3주차에는 3개, 5월 1주차에는 4개가 순위권에 올라 자외선 차단에 대한 인도 소비자들의 지속적인 관심을 확인할 수 있다.
5월 1주차에는 청량감과 쿨링 효과를 강조한 여름철 특화 선케어 제품이 새롭게 순위에 등장하면서, 계절 변화에 민감하게 반응하는 소비 트렌드를 보여줬다.
국가별 브랜드 분포를 살펴보면, 2025년 2월 3주차와 5월 1주차 Top 10 중 각각 7개, 6개를 인도 브랜드가 차지해 자국 브랜드에 대한 인도 소비자들의 신뢰가 돋보인다.
또한, 스위스 브랜드 세타필, 영국 브랜드 심플과 데톨이 6주 간의 분석 기간 내내 10위권을 유지해 특정 글로벌 브랜드에 대한 인도 소비자들의 선호도가 꾸준함을 입증했다.
비누 1위, 가르 솝 매직 솝
가르 솝(Ghar Soap)은 2019년 의붓형제인 라지브 쿠마르(Rajeev Kumar)와 로힛 쿠마르(Rohit Kumar)가 인도에서 창업한 스킨케어 브랜드다.
천연 비누에 담긴 철학과 비전을 진정성있게 전닿하며 대중의 마음을 사로잡았고, 그 후 브랜드 인지도와 매출이 가파르게 상승하며 인도에서 클린뷰티를 대표하는 스킨케어 브랜드로 자리잡았다.
가르 솝의 매직 솝은 샤프론, 샌달우드, 코코넛 오일 등 엄선한 자연유래 성분만 담았고, 제조과정은 100% 수작업으로 이뤄진다. 동물실험을 하지 않는 윤리적인 철학으로 소비자의 신뢰를 얻고 있다.
인도 소비자들의 후기를 분석한 결과, 대부분 일주일 이내에 피부 톤 개선을 체험했다는 평이 많았다.
인기 메이크업 제품 분석
2025년 2월 3주차부터 5월 1주차까지 인도 아마존의 메이크업 상위 10개 인기 제품을 분석한 결과, 립 메이크업과 아이라이너가 강세를 보였다.
특히, 메이블린의 아이라이너와 매트 립 시리즈는 6주 간의 분석 기간 내내 상위권을 유지해 지속력이 좋고 매트한 마무리감을 가진 제품들에 대한 소비자 선호도가 높음을 입증했다.
또한, 2월 3주차에는 파운데이션과 스트롭 크림이 순위에 포함된 반면, 5월 1주차에는 파우더 제품의 순위가 상승하는 등 계절에 따른 베이스 메이크업 제품에 대한 소비자 선호도 변화가 나타났다.
국가별 브랜드 분포를 살펴보면, 미국과 인도 브랜드가 균형을 이루고 있다. 미국 브랜드 메이블린이 단독으로 주차별 순위의 과반을 차지하는 압도적인 점유율을 보였다. 반면, 인도 브랜드로는 슈가 코스메틱, 르네, 라끄메, 스위스 뷰티 등 다양한 브랜드가 고르게 분포됐다.
특히, 슈가 코스메틱의 매트 립스틱은 집계 기간 내 세 차례 1위를 차지하는 등 높은 인기를 보여줬다.
립스틱 인기 1위, 슈가 코스메틱
슈가 코스메틱(SUGAR Cosmetics)은 2015년 비니타 싱(Vineeta Singh)이 설립한 뷰티 브랜드다.
창립자는 뷰티 구독 서비스 '팹 백(Fab Bag)'을 통해 20만 명 이상의 여성들과 소통하며 인도 여성들의 다양한 피부 톤에 맞는 제품이 부족하다는 문제를 발견했고, 이를 바탕으로 22가지 색상의 파운데이션 스틱을 포함한 다양한 메이크업 제품을 개발했다.
전 직원의 75%를 여성으로 구성하는 등 다양성과 포용의 가치를 실천하고 있으며, 여성의 자립과 사회 참여를 독려하는 다채로운 활동으로 브랜드 철학을 다져왔다.
슈가 코스메틱의 매트 애즈 헬 크래용 립스틱은 레드, 누드, 핑크, 퍼플 등 총 30가지 이상의 다채로운 색상으로 출시됐다.
인기 헤어케어 제품 분석
2025년 2월 3주차부터 5월 1주차까지 인도 아마존의 헤어케어 상위 10개 인기 제품을 분석한 결과, 헤어 세럼, 샴푸, 염모제 등 다양한 제품군이 고르게 포함됐다.
특히, 모발에 영양을 공급하고 수분을 유지해주는 기능성 제품들의 강세가 두드러졌다. 그 외에도 모발 성장과 비듬 개선 효과를 강조하는 제품들이 꾸준히 순위에 들어가 두피 건강 중심의 헤어케어가 주요 트렌드로 자리잡았다.
국가별 브랜드 분포를 살펴보면, 프랑스 브랜드 로레알이 2025년 2월 3주차에 5개, 5월 1주차에 6개 제품을 상위 10위에 올려 인도 헤어케어 시장에서 압도적인 영향력을 보여줬다.
헤어 세럼 인기 제품, 위시케어
위시케어(WishCare)는 2019년에 인도에서 출범한 뷰티 스타트업이다.
위시케어는 제품 출시 전부터 인도 소비자들로부터 피드백을 적극 수집 및 분석해 수요를 파악하고, 이를 제품 성분, 효능, 사용감을 개선하는데 활용해 브랜드 신뢰도를 높이고 있다.
3개월 이상 제품을 사용한 소비자들의 후기를 분석한 결과, 눈에 띄게 탈모가 줄고 새로운 모발이 자라기 시작했다는 경험담이 다수 확인됐다. 두피 가려움증 완화와 모발 굵기 개선에 대한 만족도가 높았다."

Por eso cogí la de Huda, aunque no use esas tres o cuatro sombras con ese glitter tan enorme ( muy peligroso para mis ojos operados), al resto le puedo sacar partido. Y por otro lado en Druni compré la paleta de Ysl, que me parece preciosa,y la paleta y las brochas de BH, que están a 2,99€, (al menos cuando los compré), un chollo. #comprasmaquillaje #comprascultbeauty #cultbeauty #comprasdruni  #beauty #makeup #skincare #beautyblogger #beautybloggerspain"
