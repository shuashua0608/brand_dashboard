1lc0s9u,2025-06-15 13:49:59,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ So I recently ordered Optimum Nutrition Gold Standard Whey (Dark Chocolate flavour), which is probably one of the best-selling proteins globally. The main reason I chose this was because of ON's solid reputation for consistent quality over the years ‚Äî they're supposed to be the leaders in the protein game, right? I was extra careful this time. After reading about people getting fake products from Amazon and Flipkart, I decided to order directly from the official Optimum Nutrition India website, thinking that would eliminate any risk of fakes. The order was dispatched the same day via Primarc Pecan Retail Pvt Ltd and got delivered in two days. Here's where things got weird ‚Äî I scratched the code on the bottle to verify the product, and it showed up as NOT GENUINE. I honestly didn't expect this at all, especially when ordering from their official site. Now, I do see a return option on the website, but there's no clear reason to select like ‚ÄúReceived fake product.‚Äù Has anyone else experienced this? What's the best way to go about this? Should I go straight for a return or contact customer care first? Would really appreciate any advice on this!"
mxxtosl,2025-06-15 17:21:33,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ I'm not in the US, so I can't help locally, but you can find all this stuff online or in stores like GNC or Vitamin Shoppe. Generally high quality whey protein powders will contain mostly whey protein isolate and usually little to no sugar. There may be some other sources like whey protein concentrate, but they should be listed after the isolate. Concentrate is cheaper and doesn't absorb or digest as well. So you gotta pay attention to the label, but many reputable brands will fit a keto diet without being expressly labelled as keto or low carb. I currently use Native Whey Protein Isolate Blend. It has 2 carbs per serving, one of which is sugar. I use it because its not loaded with fillers, flavors and other potentially nasty stuff. Its clean. Other popular brands I've used: Optimum Nutrition, Dymatize. Dymatize for sure makes and isolate blend with no sugar and tons of flavors. Anyway, you can get all this stuff online, probably amazon, just check the label and make sure its for the right flavor if buying online."
mxz1br7,2025-06-15 21:05:35,en,REDDIT,‚Äâ Creatine is pretty well researched and low risk for side effects. Just make sure you get creatine monohydrate. I either use bulksupplements or optimum nutrition but don't feel any sort of brand loyalty. I get 'em on Amazon.
my02i6p,2025-06-16 00:43:10,en,REDDIT,‚Äâ I personally don't trust MB and whatever that avataar brand is. I use optimum Nutrition or one science. You can try optimum Nutrition trial packs which are available online on Amazon or blinkit. Also try to consume protein with some regular food. Like protein shake after eating daal roti in breakfast.
my0bqh1,2025-06-16 01:41:34,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Not a fan of body fortress. Its a pretty low quality protein brand with alot of whey protein concentrate and fillers. I'm not sure about the macros on it. I use Optimum Nutrition, Native, and Dymatize brands regularly. Pick one that has whey protein isolate before whey protein concentrate on the label. Or ONLY isolate. You can get some good brands on amazon, or other online shops if the stuff in your local stores is garbo. Obviously just make sure it doesn't have sugar in it!"

Nutritional scientists from the University of Nottingham have tested diets comprising protein and all other nutrients against those containing little and none, and found that whilst mealworms could survive eating no protein they do need a minimum amount of protein to grow and pupate. Their findings have been published in the¬†Journal of Insects as Food and Feed. The larvae of the beetle Tenebrio molitor (yellow mealworms) were studied,¬†the insect's main components are protein, fat and fibre giving them high¬†nutritional value, and the potential to be a sustainable alternative protein source, which is likely to be as animal feed but is also being explored as a possible¬†sustainable food source for humans. These mealworms have the versatility of being able to grow on relatively low quality food sources, such as wheat bran and other cereals as well as industry by-products such as distiller's grains and garden and vegetable waste. Recent research has also shown certain types of¬†mealworm can be fed on polystyrene. This new research shows that this is not enough to produce the levels of growth and nutrition required to provide a food source and that the crude protein and fat composition of mealworms varies considerably, dependent on the feed utilised. To prove that a minimum level of nutrition is required the teams fed groups of mealworms different diets containing varying amounts of nutritional components and protein. Mealworms fed the protein-free diets appeared to halt growth and didn't enter the pupation stage of their life-cycle which is vital for breeding. This casts considerable doubt of the value of substrates free of protein (such as plastics) as viable feed sources for commercial production of mealworms. John Brameld, Professor of Nutritional Chemistry at the University of Nottingham said: ‚ÄúOur research is focused on mealworms as an effective and sustainable alternative source of protein, and we are trying to find the optimum composition of nutrients to achieve this. This research is an important step towards that as we now know that despite what previous research has suggested, mealworms need all nutrients, including protein to be able to grow and pupate. Eating plastics alone or another non-protein diet does allow them to survive, but doesn't provide the nutrients needed for the mealworms to be used as food.‚Äù Tim Parr, Professor in Nutritional Biochemistry added: ‚ÄúUnderstanding the miniumum nutritional requirements for production animals such as mealworms is a vital part of being able to move towards using them at scale as a nutritious alternative food source. We now have that baseline and know that protein is a key requirement, so we can build on this with further work to fine tune the nutritional density and quantities of feed until we find a formula that is optimal for growth of the mealworm and delivery of key nutrients in a way that is is cost effective and sustainable.‚Äù"

The global vitamin supplements market has been experiencing consistent growth, driven by rising health awareness and increasing recognition of nutritional deficiencies among consumers. Current market trends indicate a growing demand for dietary supplements, particularly vitamins and minerals, as more individuals prioritize preventive healthcare. Consumers are increasingly turning to supplements to bridge dietary gaps and support overall well-being. Request Sample Pages: Global Vitamin Supplements Market Key Takeaways According to Coherent Market Insights (CMI), the global vitamin supplements market size is projected to total USD 56.64 Bn in 2025 and USD 95.27 Bn by 2032. Global demand for vitamin supplements is anticipated to increase at a CAGR of 7.7% during the assessment period. By product type, multivitamins segment is expected to generate a market revenue of about USD 16.99 Bn in 2025. Based on formulation, tablets segment is expected to account for nearly two-fifths of the global vitamin supplements market share in 2025. Pharmacies/drugstores category will likely hold a prominent market share of over 2/5 in 2025. North America is set to retain its dominance, accounting for nearly two-fifths of the global vitamin supplements market revenue share in 2025. As per CMI's new vitamin supplements market analysis, Asia Pacific is anticipated to experience fastest growth throughout the assessment period. Rising Interest in Preventive Healthcare Fueling Market Growth Coherent Market Insights' latest vitamin supplements market research report outlines major factors driving market growth. One such key growth driver is the increasing interest in preventive healthcare. In the contemporary world, individuals are becoming more proactive in maintaining their health and preventing chronic diseases. This is prompting them to consume dietary supplements like vitamins that support immunity, bone health, and overall well-being. Consumers, especially across developing nations, are increasingly realizing the potential health benefits of vitamin supplements like vitamin D, vitamin C, and vitamin B. This growing awareness is expected to significantly boost vitamin supplement demand in the coming years. Purchase Now Up to 25% Discount on This Premium Report Regulatory Hurdles and Preference for Natural Foods Limiting Market Growth Despite a positive growth trajectory, certain factors are restraining growth of the vitamin supplements market. These include regulatory challenges and growing consumer preference for natural foods. Vitamin supplements are subject to stringent regulations, which can delay or restrict product launches. Varying regulations across different nations may hinder market expansion in the coming years. Many consumers prefer to consume whole foods and natural vitamin sources rather than opting for supplements. This is also negatively impacting the overall vitamin supplements market demand. Rising Prevalence of Chronic and Deficiency Disorders Creating Growth Prospects The incidence of chronic conditions like osteoporosis, diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases is increasing steadily. This is expected to drive demand for vitamin supplements as many of these conditions require nutritional intervention. Similarly, vitamin D deficiency, anemia, and iodine deficiency are becoming common health problems globally. Surge in such health issues is expected to open revenue-generation streams for vitamin supplement manufacturers. Many public health campaigns are being launched by government and health organizations to raise awareness about the role of vitamins and minerals in disease prevention and overall well-being. Such initiatives will also create growth avenues for manufacturers of vitamin supplements. Impact of AI on the Vitamin Supplements Market Artificial intelligence (AI) is having a profound impact on the vitamin supplements industry. This revolutionary technology is reshaping the way vitamin supplements are developed, manufactured, and distributed, leading to enhanced efficiency, accuracy, and customer satisfaction. AI is taking personalized nutrition to a whole new level by allowing companies to develop tailored products. AI-powered algorithms analyze individual health data, lifestyle patterns, and genetic information to recommend tailored supplement regimens. Artificial intelligence also assists in streamlining supply chains and enhancing product development. Additionally, it optimizes inventory management and demand forecasting, reducing waste and operational costs for manufacturers and retailers. Emerging Vitamin Supplements Market Trends A key growth-shaping trend is the rising demand for clean-label and natural products. Consumers are showing a keen preference for organic, plant-based, non-GMO vitamin supplements. Rising geriatric population is expected to positively impact sales of vitamin supplements. This is because older people often require additional vitamin intake due to age-related deficiencies. Growth of e-commerce and online channels is making it easier for consumers to access vitamin supplements.

Cereals provide most daily energy, while pulses, dairy, fruits, vegetables, and healthy fats supply protein, fibre, and essential nutrients. Fibre-rich, colourful foods aid digestion, boost immunity, and lower lifestyle disease risks. Fibre-rich food benefits: A daily diet rich in fibre helps lower cholesterol and supports blood sugar control. Diets high in fibre have been linked to reduced risks of heart disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes (Image: Canva) In a world where fast food and calorie-dense snacks are gaining popularity, many Indian adults are unknowingly missing out on essential nutrients. Here is a simple way to understand how much and what type of food you should eat daily for balanced nutrition. Tailored for a 2000 kcal diet, this ICMR model focuses on achieving the right mix of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins and minerals for optimum health. According to the ICMR-National Institute of Nutrition (NIN), the ideal daily diet for an adult consuming 2000 kcal should come from a diverse range of food groups. The guidelines suggest specific raw weight targets for each group: 250 gm of cereals (including millets), 85 gm of pulses, 300 ml of milk or curd, 400 gm of green leafy vegetables, 100 gm of fruits, 35 gm of nuts and seeds, and 27 gm of fats and oils. This balance, it says, ensures adequate intake of energy, protein, healthy fats and dietary fibre. Story continues below Alongside, ICMR also emphasises sourcing at least half of your recommended cereals from whole grains like millets, given their rich micronutrient, fibre and antioxidant content. Additionally, a colourful variety of vegetables and fruits should make up almost half your plate, improving gut health and boosting immunity through phytochemicals and antioxidants. Diet guide basics Here's how each food group fuels your body, and why balanced energy and nutrition is vital: Diet guide: Cereals, including wheat, rice, and millets, contribute about 42 percent of your daily energy needs (Image: Canva) Make cereals your main energy provider for the day:¬†Cereals, including wheat, rice, and millets, contribute about 42¬†percent of your daily energy needs, according to ICMR data. They provide complex carbohydrates that fuel your body with sustained energy throughout the day. Millets, in particular, offer bonus points for fibre and micronutrients. Health benefits of lentils: Pulses like lentils, beans and peas are a fantastic plant-based source of protein and rich in dietary fibre (Image: Canva) Rely on pulses for plant-based protein and fibre boost:¬†Pulses like lentils, beans and peas offer around 14¬†percent of your daily energy. They are a fantastic plant-based source of protein and rich in dietary fibre. Regular intake can help in muscle repair, immune function and maintaining blood sugar levels. Health benefits of milk: Dairy products like milk and curd contribute 11 percent of daily energy and provide essential nutrients like calcium, vitamin B12, and good quality protein (Image: Canva) Don't underestimate the role of milk and curd for bone health: Dairy products like milk and curd contribute 11¬†percent of daily energy and provide essential nutrients like calcium, vitamin B12, and good quality protein. This food group supports bone density, gut health, and muscle function, especially important for growing children and ageing adults. Add fats and oils mindfully for calorie density and nutrient absorption:¬†Though consumed in small quantities, fats and oils supply 12¬†percent of your total energy, thanks to their calorie density. They help in the absorption of fat-soluble vitamins like A, D, E and K. Choose healthier options like groundnut oil, mustard oil or sunflower oil for better heart health. Health benefits of fruits and vegetables: They offer a mix of vitamins (like C and A), minerals (like potassium and magnesium), and plenty of dietary fibre (Image: Canva) Fill your plate with fruits and vegetables for vitamins, minerals and fibre:¬†While low in calories, fruits and vegetables are nutrient powerhouses. They offer a mix of vitamins (like C and A), minerals (like potassium and magnesium), and plenty of dietary fibre. This makes them crucial for digestion, immunity and skin health. Prioritise dietary fibre to improve digestion and prevent lifestyle diseases: The ICMR highlights that foods like cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits, and nuts collectively meet your daily fibre needs. Fibre not only improves digestion but also keeps you feeling full for longer, helps lower cholesterol and supports blood sugar control. Diets high in fibre have been linked to reduced risks of heart disease, obesity and type 2 diabetes. Focus colourful eating to fill vitamin and mineral gaps:¬†Including green leafy vegetables, colourful fruits and whole grains like millets boosts your intake of essential micronutrients like calcium, iron, magnesium and a range of vitamins (A, C, E and B-complex). The vibrant pigments in fruits and veggies also deliver phytonutrients like flavonoids and polyphenols, offering antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.

n0m3zld,2025-06-30 17:41:16,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ This is gonna be a long answer, strap in. Here is everything I wish I'd been told when I started out. Your pellet choices are probably the best out there, so that's a good start! For feeding quantities, I would recommend getting a set of mini scales from amazon for weighing small quantities, you can (and should) weigh your birds every morning on these too. Start by giving them about 1 tbsp each of veg for breakfast and pellets for dinner, and fine tune how much you give them based on how much they eat. The pellets, tops especially, turn to powder pretty quick, but don't worry, the powder is perfectly edible too, you can leave it in (not overnight or they will probably eat that in the morning instead of chop). All birds will have different appetites, so I can't give a one size fits all answer, your best tool for how much to feed will be keeping track of the ratios of veg:pellets:nuts/seeds. There are a lot of different answers on what the ideal ratio is, I'd say a minimum of 40% veg (by weight), my tiel is pretty healthy on 50/50 breakfast/dinner, + extra bits and bobs for foraging, but every now and then he just isn't felling the veggies and leaves most of it, you don't wanna panic unless they're consistently leaving the food they normally eat. You want no more than 10-15% nuts and seeds, I weigh him a little treat portion every morning, but you can eyeball it once you know roughly what it looks like. Spike is pretty small for a cockatiel, he only eats about 6 grams of food a day. I'd also recommend buying some different whole grains (oat, wheat, rye, spelt, etc) and making a little grain mix, super healthy and good for training or foraging. The key to nutrition is diversity, as many different ingredients in little jars clogging up your cupboards as you can reasonably get, and lots of different colours and types of veggies in the chop. Stick to human grade ingredients as much as possible. If the birds are fussy with the veg to begin with, I find mixing it with a bit of steamed and mashed sweet potato works wonders for getting them to try new things. I make a dry mix for his dinner, which is pellets, whole grains, herbs, flowers, and freeze dried sprouted legumes + seeds, and some freeze dried veggies too. It has taken a LONG time to convince him half this food is edible, so keep offering new healthy things and don't give up. You will have to do some observing and fine tuning based on their specific needs, just keep adjusting until you find what maintains them at an ideal weight. For in the cage, yours already looks better than a lot of the first setups you see on here, so props to you for that. Basically, you want as many different branch widths and textures of perches you can fit, for optimum foot health. Avoid dowels, they're slippery, too consistent in width, and in my opinion, boring and a waste of potential in a setup. Adding some perches lower down, maybe a rope that leads down to the floor, will encourage them to explore and be more active. Cockatiels also like to find snacks off the floor, they do a lot of ground feeding in the wild, unlike a lot of other parrots. And if you catch them chewing up that cotton rope perch, or any other cotton they may have access too, take it out and replace it with something like sisal, jute, or hemp. Cotton, if injested, can cause dangerous crop impactions, and no one wants to send their precious baby in for surgery. Stuff attached to the outside of the cage and stands around the room/house will do wonders for their confidence in this strange new environment. If you can where you live, hang swings from the ceiling too, they'll love it. You can help them explore by training them to follow a finger, touch a target stick, or go where you point. In terms of toys, there are a few good destructible materials that are great for small birds: sola, mahogany pods, cork (spike's favourite), dried palm leaf, and balsa wood, often sold as kabobs and kabob chips. Buying loose parts and making your own is fun! If they don't know what to do with these things, you can train them to rip things up, which is also fun. A lot of bird toys are made to look good to people, but are no fun for birds. You want to look for things they can rip up, and things you can hide snacks in. The solid hard wood toys, plastic toys, mirrors, and bells are not what you want. There are some brilliant YouTube channels I've gotten a lot of my info from: BirdTricks, excellent content on training and behaviour, and BirdNerdSophie + the parrot teacher, a duo that focuses more on small birds with some great stuff on diet, foraging, and enrichment. Definitely look up foraging ideas, teaching my two how to forage, slowly making it harder and more complex, and watching their little bird brains working is so rewarding, and it keeps them happy too. It's just Spike now, and he gets his dinner in foraging activities every day, if he didn't he'd eat it in 5 seconds and then spend the next hour yelling at me. Some excellent starting materials for foraging are crinkly paper, wooden blocks to push about, and tissue paper for making little food parcels to hunt down (very cute). Most importantly, stay calm, take it at your own pace, don't get overwhelmed at the absolute wall of information I've just given you, be creative, and have fun! Parrots are difficult, complicated, and infuriating at times, but they are absolutely wonderful and I hope you can fill each other's lives with joy. Good luck!"

It's supplements that aren't allowed Second- if you are not receiving the maximum allotment of CalFresh, you can have your doctor write a note that the protein powder (specific brand will help in case your county asks you to try a cheaper brand) is medically necessary and provide proof of purchase. It should be allowed as an out of pocket medical expense to help you get a higher amount of CalFresh. But that only works if it really can't be purchased with CalFresh. Speaking of cheaper brand - really look around. Optimum Nutrition brand has 24g of protein per scoop, and is available on Amazon with listings that are EBT eligible. And I can usually get it at Costco if that's a cheaper option for you."

1ls2cmj,2025-07-05 05:24:16,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Citing- Last month around 4,000 people bought muscle blaze double rich chocolate whey protein on amazon. While around 6,000 people bought the whole truth unflavoured whey protein. Its a good thing some brands are giving 500rs samples nowadays on blinkit due to competition so we can try before purchasing in bulk. My questions- 1- Why India being a leading producer of milk, has whey protein priced heavily even though its derived from milk? I think govt should subsidise them, won't increased productivity help govt in the end? 2- Why does the whole truth whey protein is being more bought then muscle blaze whey, even though whole truth is unflavoured, similarly priced and quite new entry (therefore suspicious) in market? 3- Many leading brands sell digestive enzymes along with whey protein, why do we Indians lack protein digesting enzymes? Is it our natural defense mechanism to avoid fatal issues caused by too much protein? 4- The taste of unflavoured muscle blaze whey protein concentrate is sour and bitter, also the taste of optimum nutrition double rich chocolate whey protein is very less chocolate/sweet type compared to mb double rich one, I have to try very hard to stop feeling of gag reflex/gastric uneasiness upon drinking of bad taste whey protein with water (i dont like adding it to milk, banana,etc, i like my protein raw in water), how are people really coping with them, though they really dont care for awful taste? then why do people still buying these two boxes of whey? 6- why beginner's whey protein boxes are not popular for people beginning gym? Why do I feel low on energy without whey protein and even eggs and chicken dont help much until I take whey protein? 7- Why should I mix whey evenly in water, whats wrong with leaving lumps?"

Clearly, as well as being an impressive England captain, Leah Williamson, 28, has a catwalk-worthy fashion career too. One of the biggest earners off the pitch after leading the Lionesses to victory at the Euro 2022 final, the blonde beauty has a deal with Nike and has collaborated with global brands such as Aston Martin, Pepsi, Walkers and Mastercard. With 1.1 million Instagram followers, she has new advert partnerships with Weetabix and Cadbury, along with six children's books, titled The Wonder Team. With the deals comes the gloss: her recent lavish Mallorcan holiday to an Ikos resort would have set her back in the region of ¬£1,000 a night. She is rumoured to be dating former model and Miss USA Elle Smith - both have posted about each other on social media. LAUREN'S OOH LA LA LEGO PROVING that every passion can be profitable, Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp, 24, has topped up her estimated ¬£400,000 salary with a sponsorship deal with Lego. Devoted to creating Lego masterpieces in her downtime, saying it's 'the best way to relax', she's even made the Mona Lisa out of the bricks. Her other sponsors include Nike and Sports Direct. Lauren also has the support of her girlfriend, former Liverpool midfielder Ashley Hodson. Together for two years, the pair recently enjoyed a romantic trip to Paris, where Lauren saw the Mona Lisa in her more traditional setting. SHY SUPERSTAR WITH AN EX ON THE TEAM GROWING up, Lucy Bronze lived on Lindisfarne - also known as Holy Island - off the windswept coast of Northumberland. Her grandmother was caretaker of Lindisfarne Castle and today the outline of that building is tattooed on Lucy's wrist. Shy into adulthood, she was diagnosed with ADHD and autism in 2021. But neither her isolated upbringing nor her neurodiversity held her back. Rather, she's said she uses the intense focus associated with her conditions to her advantage - and now the 33-year-old is one of the biggest earners in the game. She reportedly took home ¬£200,000 a year while playing at Barcelona before her move to Chelsea in 2024. Big money deals followed her triumph at the last Euros, with Pepsi, EE, Klarna and Visa among her backers. Her former girlfriend is fellow Lioness Keira Walsh. FASHION WEEK REGULAR SHE earned almost ¬£2million in 2023 alone, according to Forbes magazine. That same year, Alessia Russo's transfer from Manchester United to Arsenal made her one of the most expensive female footballers on the planet. Her contract is said to be worth more than ¬£500,000 a year and her commercial appeal is just as lucrative. She has deals with Gucci, Adidas, PlayStation, Beats by Dr Dre and last month was gifted an MGS5 EV car, which she proudly showed off on Instagram. A regular at London Fashion Week, Alessia, 26, has appeared on the cover of magazines such as Women's Health. The BAFTA TV Awards in May saw her in a ¬£1,295 Roland Mouret dress, right. BURBERRY CLAD GOALIE BURBERRY HANNAH Hampton - the longhaired goalkeeper with the girl-next-door looks - certainly has big shoes to fill after Mary Earps surprisingly announced her retirement from the squad last month. The 24-year-old Chelsea player has posed in Burberry for Elle magazine and counts Nike and Extra chewing gum among her corporate sponsors. She also works with Birmingham Children's Hospital after enduring numerous eye operations as a child to cure a squint. Hannah was told she would never be a professional sports player. ' I've gone through life proving people wrong,' she said recently, words that inspired devotion among her 228,000 Instagram followers. Her relationship status isn't known. DUBAI DEVOTEE SHE never travels without her Louis Vuitton luggage, can often be seen posing in a Maybach car, and enjoys swanky trips to Dubai, staying at the luxury Five resort there. Chelsea star Lauren James, 23, has treated herself to some of the finer things in life since her key role in the Lionesses' 2023 World Cup campaign. While her relationship status isn't known, she's close to her older brother Reece, who plays for the Chelsea men's team. She has commercial deals with Nike, Google Pixel, Optimum Nutrition, Sure deodorant and Walkers. The superstar siblings often attend red carpet events together. But while she is reportedly on ¬£350,000 a year at Chelsea, Reece earns ¬£250,000 a week. KOOKY STYLE SO DEVOTED is she to tattoos that midfielder Georgia Stanway, 26, not only has around 100 of her own inkings, but she's also learned to tattoo other people. The Bayern Munich star's kooky style has won her sponsors including Nike and an advertising deal with Celsius drinks, who featured on her Instagram page, where she has 433,000 followers. Off the pitch, she's been with Toulouse rugby league player Olly Ashall-Bott since 2022...."

I do also enjoy the soya based fake meats every now and then, they're usually pretty good for protein. I buy the Chia Charge soya protein crispies from Amazon. They're pretty bland but a good protein boost and good to add to breakfasts (I like them added to soya yogurt and protein granola) There are a good number of vegan protein shakes available but I'm personally not a massive fan. The Optimum Nutrition clear vegan protein is quite nice (I buy the peach flavour) and iirc it was higher protein than the other clear vegan proteins."

n2by3nf,2025-07-10 08:57:26,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Damn, sorry you had a rough experience bro ‚Äî totally fair to be frustrated when stuff like that happens. For what it's worth, I've had the opposite experience so far. Been using Hyugalife for the past 5 months, mainly for protein powders (bought Optimum Nutrition and MuscleBlaze a few times), and I've had no major issues. Deliveries usually show up in 3‚Äì5 days in Mumbai, and once when I had a delay, I DMed them on Instagram and actually got a quick reply ‚Äî way faster than emailing support. Also made the address mistake once üòÖ ‚Äî I called the courier directly (they used Delhivery in my case), and the guy helped reroute it to a pickup point nearby. Still annoying, but I think these issues happen on most platforms, tbh. HealthKart gave me a broken shaker once, and Amazon once sent me the wrong flavor ‚Äî so no one's perfect. That said, I always go for COD now and avoid big orders unless it's during their sale periods (like July 12‚Äì14 coming up), 'cause that's when the deals are actually worth it. If you're ordering again, maybe try sticking to known brands + COD and see if it's smoother? Hope your refund comes through fast though ‚Äî been there, it sucks."

As a Prime member for 12+ years, I've spent over $25,000 on Amazon US and always experienced seamless, respectful support whenever issues came up. But my recent experience with Amazon INDIA has been deeply frustrating. I ordered an Optimum Nutrition Whey Protein 2kg (‚Çπ7,800) via Amazon.in. The package was marked ‚ÄúDelivered‚Äù on July 3‚Äîbut never arrived. Instead,¬†delivery person swapped protein packets with 2 packets of 1 kg salt. A case of blatant package tampering and fraud. Despite 5+ calls and escalation to a customer service ‚Äúleader,‚Äù I was denied both a refund and a replacement. With Amazon US, issues were resolved in minutes, with trust placed in the customer. With Amazon India, I was treated with suspicion and made to fight for basic accountability‚Äîfor a product worth less than $100. It raises some hard questions: Why is the India team so disempowered? Why is trust in the customer nonexistent, even with proof? Is this the same Amazon that built its reputation on ‚Äúcustomer obsession‚Äù? Loyal customers shouldn't have to beg for fairness. @Amazon ‚Äì this isn't the standard we expect Amit Agarwal from Amazon India #CustomerExperience #AmazonIndia #CustomerService #Trust #Ecommerce #Leadership #CX #PrimeMember"

1lzed7l,2025-07-14 05:39:06,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ This might be a dumb question, but the dilemma made no sense to me with the information about creatine and creapure i found online so i decided to ask here in case im missing something. I read that creapure is better than normal creatine but creatine is cheaper. I looked through a post about creatine in a subreddit about my country. Everyone said they sourced their creatine from this popular online shopping platform that's similar to amazon cause it was apparently the cheapest place. The website is selling optimum nutrition micronized creatine powder 300g for 36.80 dollars. But the decathlon in my country is selling creapure powder 300g for 24.90 dollars. Am i missing something obvious? Why did everyone in my country recommend to buy online when its clearly cheaper at decathlon? Is decathlon creapure considered bad or ineffective or something since its that much cheaper?"
