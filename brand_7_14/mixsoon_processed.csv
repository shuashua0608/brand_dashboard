Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder to absorb oil and blur pores so effectively that you'll be like, ""Oh ... witchcraft??"" Might be the only explanation for how this can matte-ify your complexion while still keeping it radiant and glowy ‚ú®. Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""I loved this setting powder, it blurred my pores and blended my makeup so well that even my husband noticed. Wow! I will be buying more before people find it and sell it all out, hehehe."" ‚ÄîCharlotte Laim Get it from Amazon for¬†$25. 2. Kuumba Made's¬†$11 Vanilla Bean fragrance roll-on¬†and Golden Sky roll-on¬†‚Äî the first is a ""true vanilla"" that layers with other scents like a dream, whereas Golden Sky is a decadent blend of vanilla, rose, and amber that does all the layering for you. These are potent, super long-lasting, and oh-so-delicious ... hence why TikTok keeps selling them out. Kuumba Made is a small business that specializes in roll-on scents. Check out a TikTok of the vanilla bean roll-on in action. Promising review (for Vanilla Bean): ""Buy it now. I love the smell of this, it's a true vanilla scent, super strong, and I got soooo many compliments. I had no leaks. Feels great on the skin. Not super floral, a perfect vanilla. Totally worth the money."" ‚ÄîKc Promising review (for Golden Sky): ""The scent is absolutely divine ‚Äî sweet, warm, and rich without being overly overpowering. It's the perfect vanilla fragrance that feels both cozy and elegant. I love how natural and smooth it smells, with no artificial or overly sugary notes."" ‚ÄîTamara Jones Get it from Amazon: Vanilla Bean for¬†$9.99¬†and Golden Sky for $9.99. 3. L'Or√©al Paris BB Cream, a FAST-acting, anti-redness moisturizer with results that feel like legitimate magic ‚Äî especially considering its competitor, the Dr Jart+¬†Cicapair¬†Color Correcting Cream, is over twice as expensive. Reviewers especially love this as a base for their makeup, because it leaves skin super soft and primed. Promising review: ""I'd yet to find anything (even foundation) that could cover up my red areas. Checks, chin, nose, and forehead. It comes out green, but has a gorgeous lightweight finish of a tint that indeed covers my redness beautifully. There's no greasiness to it at all. It dries down to a beautiful matte finish. It's super easy to use. I use my fingers. The texture is like silk. It leaves my face baby-soft, not sticky at all. It doesn't settle into my fine lines or wrinkles, and I don't need powder to 'bake' it under my eyes. It also covers the black circles under my eyes."" ‚ÄîJulie F. Get it from Amazon for $9.98¬†(available in six styles). 4. Olay Super Serum Body Wash that will make anyone with dry or dull skin REJOICE ‚Äî this is packed with niacinamide, shea butter, and collagen peptides to nourish your skin for 24-hour hydration that will make you feel ~luminous~. (Psst ‚Äî this is the body wash version of their TikTok-famous, super effective facial Super Serum, so you KNOW they mean business.) Check out a TikTok of the Olay Super Serum Body Wash in action. Promising review: ""I recently tried the Olay Super Serum Body Wash, and I am absolutely in love with it! The formula is incredibly hydrating, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth after every use. It lathers beautifully and has a lovely, light fragrance that isn't overpowering...."

Cleansing Oil ‚Äì Removes waterproof makeup easily while keeping the skin nourished. It has a noticeable scent, but removes my makeup very well. Centella Essence ‚Äì 100% centella asiatica. It's been great for calming down inflammation, it absorbs without feeling sticky. Bean Essence ‚Äì A refreshing step that helps with oil balance and smooth texture. Fermented ingredients include pomegranate, pear, and barley seed. The Master Serum has been the most effective ‚Äî I love its repairing properties and how it helps clear up my skin gently. I rarely finish skincare products, but this is one I've actually emptied really fast‚Ä¶ and I'll definitely repurchase it. The Bean Cream is another favorite. I usually save it for nighttime or when my skin feels extra dry ‚Äî especially during colder months. It's rich, comforting, and works fast when my skin needs a little extra help. ‚òÄÔ∏è Centella Sun Cream ‚Äì SPF 50+ PA++++, with a soft, non-greasy finish.

An¬†Anua pore-clearing cleansing oil¬†that visibly sucks out sebum from your pores and removes makeup residue and blackheads, leaving your skin looking clearer and feeling smoother. Reviewers of all skin types swear by it, including those with acne-prone skin (who say it doesn't cause¬†breakouts)! BTW, a lot of reviewers say they use this as part of their double cleansing routine. As the name implies, double cleansing is¬†a method of cleansing your face twice: first with an oil-based cleanser, and again with a water-based cleanser to help get all the yucky stuff out of your pores. Promising review:¬†""BEST OIL CLEANSER I SWEAR. I've gone through 3‚Äì4 bottles now and it continues to cleanse my skin AMAZING. It melts makeup, clears pores. Honestly it's heaven-sent. The first time I used it, it cleared a lot of my sebum and even now when I use it, it clears any dead skin and dirt I have, even when I don't wear makeup. BUY IT, it's amazing. You can see all the dirt that came out of my face recently in the¬†photo¬†[above, right]."" ‚Äîrexichor Get it from Amazon for $17.69. 2. A¬†Beauty of Joseon glow serum, aka the secret ingredient to more glass-like skin. This lightweight serum uses rice bran water and 2% alpha-arbutin, a skin-brightening hero that can help fade hyperpigmentation and acne scars. One reviewer said they don't have to wear as much highlighter because their skin was glowing so much, while another¬†swears they don't even need foundation anymore because their skin tone is so even. And don't worry: Even though this is a serum, it won't leave you feeling like you just smeared olive oil over your face. Promising review: ""I love starting my day with this face product! It feels light and refreshing on my skin, and it absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy residue. Since I started using it, my face looks more awake, hydrated, and glowing. It's become an essential part of my morning routine and helps me feel confident all day. Highly recommend for anyone wanting a simple but effective skincare boost!"" ‚ÄîAmazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $16.50. 3. The¬†Saem hydrating eye stick, a perfect remedy for dehydrated skin. This eye treatment is made with Icelandic glacier water, giving your skin the fresh hydration boost it needs on days when you've hit the snooze button one too many times. It can also help tighten the appearance of eye wrinkles if you'd prefer for them not to be as noticeable. And here's a tip! It reduces puffiness faster if used after refrigeration. Promising review: ""I'm a 64-year-old woman who has entered the realm of 'mature-aged skin' and I was looking for a stick moisturizer to use around my eyes. I have dark circles and puffiness around my eyes, and I wanted to find something to lighten the dark circles, decrease the puffiness, and hydrate my eye area. This little bear did just that, and I use it every morning and evening. It has helped my eye area quite a bit (better than putting ice cubes on my eyes when I was a teenager). This will not eliminate the dark circles and the puffiness, but it does reduce it. Very nice product and great price point."" ‚ÄîM. Ellis Get it from Amazon for $9.99. 4. Mixsoon Bean Essence¬†that hydrates and exfoliates your skin at the same dang time.

Promising reviews: ""I saw this all over TikTok/Instagram and decided to buy it because I have a lot of sebaceous filaments on my chin and nose. It's a little expensive but I took a gamble: it works! You can physically see the sebaceous filaments come out of your pores, it is not the product bunching up. My problem areas were so much smoother after using and are left with a moisturized glow.

From July 8th through July 11th, we'll be wading through the mountains of bargains for you to find some of the best deals in every category. For *now*, we're finding the best pre-Prime Day deals and reminding you to sign up for a¬†Prime membership¬†so you can take advantage of the sale! 1. Y0140 iRobot Roomba for 49% off (the best price yet) because if robots are gonna steal our jobs, it might as well be the bad ones. This bagless machine vacuums AND mops at the same time with a special brush, meaning you might actually have clean floors for once. Promising review: ""I love this robot. We got this because our baby is constantly on the floor, so we just wanted a little extra help with keeping the floors clean. We run it every night, and seeing how much it picks up blows our mind. We have two dogs, so dog hair and Cheerios are mainly what we get, but it has definitely made a difference with our floors on top of what we already do to keep our floors clean. Highly recommend. We have vinyl wood floors, so it runs fine on it, but it can go on carpet as well. We just leave the room doors closed because it is very loud when it runs and we don't want it to come into the rooms."" ‚ÄîMakayla Price: $139.99 (originally $274; also available in two other styles for a different or no discount) 2. A super cute one-piece swimsuit for up to 50% off with ruched details and a fun cut-out design that will have people falling over themselves to compliment you. Just remind them there's no running by the pool after you brag that you scored it at its lowest price ever. Promising reviews: ""I had to come on here and rave about this bathing suit. I NEVER leave reviews. I have literally tried at least 10 bathing suits from different stores including Amazon due to postpartum. This bathing suit is IT. The ruching is in the right places, and the cut of the bathing suit is so nice. I love that it looks like a two-piece. Get it!"" ‚ÄîRuby B. ""The best one-piece swimsuit I've ever worn! So comfy and the fit is so chic. Great suit for the price!"" ‚ÄîLeslie Price: $19.99+ (typically $39.99; available in sizes XS‚ÄìXXL and 17 styles) 3. A lightning-fast ionic hair dryer and diffuser for 50% off reviewers say will dry your hair faster than you can text your friend ""leaving now."" It comes with two nozzles for straight and curly hair, so this quiet, lightweight dryer is kind of a must-buy. Promising review: ""The 150,000 RPM motor is incredibly powerful ‚Äî it dries my thick, shoulder-length hair in under 5 minutes. This is a huge time-saver, especially on busy mornings. My hair feels smoother, shinier, and far less frizzy after each use. No more static flyaways either. This dryer is surprisingly lightweight and compact without sacrificing performance. It's easy to handle, and it doesn't take up much space in my travel bag. It easily rivals more expensive salon brands at a fraction of the price."" ‚ÄîAmazon Customer Price: $59.99 (typically $119.99; available in two colors) 4. Quick-dry retractable gel pens for 36% off perfect for bullet journalers, dedicated color coders, and type A+ people looking for a superior writing utensil option. Reviewers confirm these don't smudge, and the colors really pop. Promising review: ""These are my absolute favorite pens. I feel like they are priced pretty fair for how many you get in one package. I love all the different colors...."

Essence's Drop of Sunshine Bronzing Drops¬†‚Äî this¬†sheer, buildable formula is a perf $6 alternative to Drunk Elephant's version that goes for a whopping $39! Not only will this stuff leave you with a perfect sun-kissed glow, but it also contains glycerin to hydrate the skin barrier and vitamin E to soften the skin and smooth texture! Promising review: ""I love this so I ordered a second for backup! Depending on my day, I will add no more than one or two drops to my moisturizer or my primer. Takes away the winter pallor of my face, which definitely has not had enough sun lately. The bottle is small, but you don't need to use much. Reasonably priced for the amount. I would say buy it."" ‚ÄîIncognito Get it from Amazon for $5.99. 2. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder¬†to instantly matte-ify your skin while helping it maintain its natural glow thanks to the blue hyaluronic acid. It even comes in a mess-free, travel-friendly case so you can take it on the go. That's a major upgrade to your routine, if I do say so myself. Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""I loved this setting powder, it blurred my pores and blended my makeup so well that even my husband noticed. Wow! I will be buying more before people find it and sell it all out, hehehe."" ‚ÄîCharlotte Laim Get it from Amazon for¬†$25. 3. OR¬†Catrice's Magic Shine Eraser¬†if the *final* step in your skincare regimen involves trying literally anything and everything to prevent that unwanted oily layer from showing up uninvited. This gel-to-powder formula will help smooth, mattify, and refine your skin for a flawless blurring effect that'll feel like you're walking around with a filter on your face! It's compact enough to pop in your bag and take with you when you're traveling. This vegan, cruelty-free formula is free from parabens, fragrance, phthalates, alcohol, oil, preservatives, paraffin, and talc. Promising review: ""Does exactly what it says. Removes shine and gives a soft-focus effect to the makeup. Perfect for when you've been busy and your makeup is a little shiny in places. Doesn't change the color or texture of the makeup either or risk spilling or cracking like powder. A+"" ‚ÄîTheWildSide Get it from Amazon for $8. 4. A hair identifier spray¬†because if dermaplaning has become an essential step in your routine, this stuff is about to change the game. This spray will lower your chances of missing a spot, and reviewers even say it left their skin feeling baby smooth because it helps the razor glide across the skin more easily! It comes with one bottle of hair identifier spray and four razors! Promising review: ""The power of the hair identifier's spray is unmatched. Once you spray in any direction that has hair, it automatically identifies the hair that needs to be removed. It is easily sprayed on and easily wiped off. No extra residue. Comes with four blades, and I say these blades are soft and gentle yet get the job done. Not sure why no one ever thought of coming up with a hair identifier spray. Great value and smells like baby powder. Great quality."" ‚ÄîKarine Get it from Amazon for¬†$8.99¬†(also available in multipacks). 5. Sol De Janeiro's Delicia Drench Body Butter¬†that'll shower you with fast-absorbing moisture that lasts all day long while working to improve your skin barrier. It also smells downright delightful, like the¬†Cheirosa 59 body mist, to be exact ‚Äî¬† if you don't know, it's a tantalizing blend of vanilla orchid, sugared violet, and sandalwood...."

Promising review: ""I thought this promotion was fake, but I ordered it hoping I'd get a good product ‚Äî and I did! OMG! If you're thinking about trying Moroccanoil, you can totally start with these minis to see if they work for you. And let me tell you, these products are 100% recommended! They're perfect as a gift or just for your own use. So worth it!"" ‚ÄîAlehandra Get it from Amazon for $10. 3. A clever¬†magnetic two-layer fridge shelf so roomy and useful that your fruit bowl will be like ""Excuse me? What is SHE doing here??"" Reviewers are especially impressed with how strong the magnet is on these, and how much space it saves them! Promising review: ""OMG. This was a worthy investment. I can't tell you how many people ask about these baskets when they visit my house. If you are into the farmhouse vibes, these are the perfect addition. I hate storing things on my counter, but I love that I can always keep fresh fruit and veggies from the store or garden readily available. The kids love that it is easy to get to, and I am incredibly surprised by how strong the magnet is. I have another one in the coffee nook on the other side of the fridge that holds the coffee pods and seasonings. Love how this has saved me space."" ‚ÄîHereIAm Get it from Amazon for $22.98 (available in three colors). 4. Olay's Firming Body Lotion full of collagen peptides and a Vitamin B3 complex for *ultra* hydration designed to visibly plump, firm, and moisturize your skin ‚Äî all at a fraction of the price of other firming lotions, like the internet's beloved $48 Elasti-Cream. Psst ‚Äî there's a matching elasticity-boosting collagen body wash as well! Promising review: ""I have spent a lifetime looking for a lotion as good as this one. I am so happy to have tried this, and now I will use it forever. It smells fantastic, comes in a cute bottle, is reasonably priced, and my skin is softer and more hydrated than ever. I've tried everything for dry, itchy, sensitive skin. I use this daily, and I love it. Butters and oils leave me feeling gross and greasy, and most lotions simply do not do the job, and I'll have to reapply constantly. This I apply once daily, and my skin is so soft and healthy now."" ‚ÄîPaige Get it from Amazon for $9.99¬†(available in four other styles). 5. Marshmallow Blush Perfume, a romantic, soft scent that has taken TikTok by STORM for this summer ‚Äî reviewers are obsessed with how beautifully this strawberry-leaning scent blends vanilla, floral, and fruity notes for the ultimate summer vibe...."

It glides on, but the best part is that it doubles as a moisturizer! It's two of your skincare steps in one, and it's super moisturizing. No white cast, great for your face. I'm sure you know that sunscreen DAILY is the best thing you can do for your skin. The price is better than the expensive US brands. Korea sunscreens have UVA and UVB filters. The FDA hasn't approved any new sunscreen ingredients since 1999, but Korean beauty has, and it can be sold on Amazon. The FDA is slow to approve the newest products that have been proven safe and better.

18069223444843562,2025-07-05 22:30:08,en,INSTAGRAM,"‚Äâ Lately, I've been more intentional about what goes into my skincare routine, especially when it comes to cleansing. Mixsoon, a premium Korean brand known for its minimalist 3-layer skincare philosophy, caught my attention. Their Cleansing Oil is enriched with fermented ingredients like soybean, barley, pomegranate, and pear‚Äîdesigned to deeply cleanse without irritating sensitive skin. I specifically picked this up for days when I wear heavier makeup‚Äîthose times when a foaming cleanser alone doesn't quite get the job done. I wanted something that would effectively remove makeup without over-stripping or irritating my skin. This oil cleanser did just that‚Äîit melted everything away while leaving my skin soft and my eyelashes intact. The only thing that didn't quite work for me was the fragrance. It's subtle and not unpleasant, but I tend to be sensitive to artificial scents. Otherwise, it's been a solid addition to my routine. mixsoon_usa stackinfluence #mixsoon #mixsoonpartner #koreanskincare #glassskin #skincareroutine #amazonproducttester #amazonfinds #ecommerce #amazoninfluencer"

If you missed my last post, here's the quick rundown: they're a Korean skincare brand that takes a less-is-more approach, using fermented botanicals and clean formulations to deliver glass-skin results. This Galactomyces Ferment Essence isn't so much about exfoliating as it is about calming and refining the skin. With fermented sake at its core, it helps even out texture, minimize the look of pores, and support collagen production‚Äîwhich becomes increasingly important in your 30s. I also appreciate that it doesn't have any strong fragrances, and on the days I use it, I've noticed my skin looks a little less red and more balanced overall. I'll share more updates as I continue using it. mixsoon_usa stackinfluence #mixsoon #mixsoonpartner #koreanskincare #glassskin #skincareroutine #amazon #ecommerce #producttester #amazoninfluencer"

There are more deals than you could ever begin to look through on your own...so that's where we come in. We waded through the mountains of bargains for you and found some of the best deals in every category. FYI ‚Äî deals move *fast*. We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder for 30% off (the first time it's been on sale since it launched, and LOWEST price it's ever been) to absorb oil and blur pores so effectively that you'll be like, ""Oh ... witchcraft??"" Might be the only explanation for how this can matte-ify your complexion while still keeping it radiant and glowy. ‚ú® Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""I loved this setting powder, it blurred my pores and blended my makeup so well that even my husband noticed. Wow! I will be buying more before people find it and sell it all out, hehehe."" ‚ÄîCharlotte Laim Price: $17.50 (typically $25) 2. Clinique Almost Lipstick Tinted Lip Balm in Black Honey for 30% off you're definitely going to want to stock up on *now*, before TikTokers go feral again (guilty as charged). This cult-classic, lightweight, slightly glossy shade is beyond ""holy grail"" status ‚Äî it matches skin tones so beautifully that I'm personally starting to suspect witchcraft, after seeing so many TikToks of it subtly transforming entire beauty looks with just a few swipes. I was very adamant about not buying this for the longest time because I am stubborn about ""expensive"" beauty products, but this is worth every penny and then some. It's so lightweight and layerable, it's foolproof to apply, and I have yet to wear a single outfit it doesn't complement??? I love watching it instantly elevate a casual look or add simple elegance to dressy ones. I wear it every day now, and after weeks of use, I've barely made a dent. Also, and maybe this is just me, but I tend to get pigment on my teeth with a lot of lip products, and I've simply never had an issue with this magic stick. Anyway, watch this TikTok of someone using it on their lips AND cheeks, because I did and oops, this lipstick FELL into my cart. Promising review: ""This lipstick is a game changer. It goes on and stays on well. It is pretty sheer, but buildable. I have trouble with most red lipsticks turning pink after a bit. So, I will put this over my other colors, and it absolutely makes a difference. It's a great staple to keep in your cosmetic bag. It is something I will definitely buy again. You should absolutely try it!"" ‚ÄîAmy H. Price: $17.50 (originally $25; also available in pink honey!) 3. A pack of Crest 3D Whitestrips for 35% off so you can channel Chip Skylark and belt out ""My Shiny Teeth And Me"" wherever you roam. It comes with 44 strips total, which is enough for 20 regular treatments and two one-hour express treatments. Check out a TikTok of the Crest 3D Whitestrips in action. Promising review: ""I haven't used Crest White Strips in over five years. Since then, my teeth have stayed really white, and I frequently get compliments or questions about how I got my teeth so white. I decided to get a box to boost the whiteness of my teeth. Wow, I was shocked at how much these have improved! Before, the strips were really flimsy, hard to remove from the package, and really hard to keep on your teeth ‚Äî the old ones would slip or bunch up. These are such an improvement! The new strips remove easily from the plastic they are on. The strips are REALLY adhesive! These will not budge!..."

We waded through the mountains of bargains for you and found some of the best deals in every category. FYI ‚Äî deals move *fast*. We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder for 30% off Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""I loved this setting powder, it blurred my pores and blended my makeup so well that even my husband noticed. Wow! I will be buying more before people find it and sell it all out, hehehe."" ‚Äî Charlotte Laim Price: $17.50 (typically $25) A 40-ounce Stanley Quencher for 40% off select colors Check out a TikTok of the Stanley in action. Promising review: ""I used to make fun of people for using these Stanley cups; I always thought they were overpriced and overhyped. But I purchased this for my little sister who is in nursing school, and she takes this thing with her everywhere!!! All she does is rave about how amazing it is! So I bought one as well, and they really are amazing products. Made super well, they keep ice in them for hours and hours! Super comfortable to hold in your hand, not too heavy or bulky. Easy to clean and seem to be super durable. I've dropped mine I don't even know how many times now, and not a single mark! They also don't leak easy at all. Unless you're holding it completely upside down, even then it doesn't leak fast. Super happy!"" ‚Äî Jon & Katie Severs Price: $27 (originally $45; deal available on select colors, including fuchsia, plum, mist, and stargaze) and shop all the Stanley deals here Clinique Almost Lipstick Tinted Lip Balm in Black Honey for 30% off I was very adamant about not buying this for the longest time because I am stubborn about ""expensive"" beauty products, but this is worth every penny and then some. It's so lightweight and layerable, it's foolproof to apply, and I have yet to wear a single outfit it doesn't complement??? I love watching it instantly elevate a casual look or add simple elegance to dressy ones. I wear it every day now, and after weeks of use, I've barely made a dent. Also, and maybe this is just me, but I tend to get pigment on my teeth with a lot of lip products, and I've simply never had an issue with this magic stick. Anyway, watch this TikTok of someone using it on their lips AND cheeks, because I did and oops, this lipstick FELL into my cart. Promising review: ""This lipstick is a game changer. It goes on and stays on well. It is pretty sheer, but buildable. I have trouble with most red lipsticks turning pink after a bit. So, I will put this over my other colors, and it absolutely makes a difference. It's a great staple to keep in your cosmetic bag. It is something I will definitely buy again. You should absolutely try it!"" ‚Äî Amy H. Price: $17.50 (originally $25; also available in pink honey!) A pack of Crest 3D Whitestrips for 35% off Check out a TikTok of the Crest 3D Whitestrips in action. Promising review: ""I haven't used Crest White Strips in over five years. Since then, my teeth have stayed really white, and I frequently get compliments or questions about how I got my teeth so white. I decided to get a box to boost the whiteness of my teeth...."

We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial¬†here. 1. The TikTok-viral Tirtir cushion foundation ‚Äî for 60% off, a new lowest-ever price! ‚Äî that offers 72 hours of flawless wear, blending seamlessly to hide redness, blemishes, and under-eye bags. It has buildable coverage, perfect for a natural look or full glam. Plus, it's packed with hibiscus and red propolis extracts for a boost in skin elasticity. And to top it all off, its oval-shaped puff can reach every little corner of your face. Check out this TikTok of Mikayla Nogueira's review of this foundation. Promising review: ""I struggle with finding a foundation that's not orange. Someone recommended I try a Korean product, and this started going viral around the same time. I lucked into a perfect color match on the first try, but I've learned there are sample packs if you aren't sure about the color. The coverage is incredible. It was very lightweight, not heavy at all. It did settle into my under-eye wrinkles without primer, so if you're older, that's something to keep in mind. Overall, beautiful and long-lasting. This will be my go-to foundation from now on."" ‚ÄîAJ Bond Price: $10 (originally $25; available in 40 shades and a mini size) 2. A ""Gracula"" garlic crusher for 57% off, because you know what? If a 108-year-old vampire lurking moodily in the trees in the Pacific Northwest isn't going to fall in love with you and grant you immortality, one might as well make your life in the kitchen a little easier. Promising review: ""I love this little guy. I found him on a BuzzFeed list and had to have it as soon as I saw it! I've minced as many as five cloves in it in seconds. It's a little tricky getting all of the garlic out once minced (I use a silicone basting brush to get most of it, but I always use more than the recipe calls for anyway, so it's not a deal breaker). Cleanup is a breeze because he goes right in the dishwasher!"" ‚ÄîBarbie Price: $9.95 (typically $18.99) 3. Mixsoon Bean Essence for 55% off (the lowest price it's ever been!!) ‚Äî this TikTok-beloved K-beauty staple for exfoliating and hydrating is a secret weapon that anyone chasing the ~glass skin~ look will want to know about immediately. You can use this as a low-maintenance, high results exfoliant by massaging it into your skin two to three times a week for a smoother, brighter, more even complexion. Promising reviews: ""I saw this all over TikTok/Instagram and decided to buy it because I have a lot of sebaceous filaments on my chin and nose. It's a little expensive but I took a gamble: it works! You can physically see the sebaceous filaments come out of your pores; it is not the product bunching up. My problem areas were so much smoother after using and were left with a moisturized glow. I then proceeded to have my boyfriend use this product to see if it worked this well on everyone on the first try, and it worked on his nose as well. Amazing stuff. "" ‚ÄîLosa ""I have hyperpigmentation and oily skin. I feel this product regulates my oil production and it helps my makeup look so flawless. 10/10."" ‚ÄîMissKayMae..."
