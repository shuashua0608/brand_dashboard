mov_27F9D1C4243FF8EC371CD32D35C8E4E5,2025-06-14 08:31:03,en,WEB,"  The audacity of this body wash version of Olay's Super Serum to be so good for dry skin and *not* just magically appear in your shower. 1. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder to absorb oil and blur pores so effectively that you'll be like, ""Oh ... witchcraft??"" Might be the only explanation for how this can matte-ify your complexion while still keeping it radiant and glowy ✨. Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""I loved this setting powder, it blurred my pores and blended my makeup so well that even my husband noticed. Wow! I will be buying more before people find it and sell it all out, hehehe."" —Charlotte Laim Get it from Amazon for $25. 2. Kuumba Made's $11 Vanilla Bean fragrance roll-on and Golden Sky roll-on — the first is a ""true vanilla"" that layers with other scents like a dream, whereas Golden Sky is a decadent blend of vanilla, rose, and amber that does all the layering for you. These are potent, super long-lasting, and oh-so-delicious ... hence why TikTok keeps selling them out. Kuumba Made is a small business that specializes in roll-on scents. Check out a TikTok of the vanilla bean roll-on in action. Promising review (for Vanilla Bean): ""Buy it now. I love the smell of this, it's a true vanilla scent, super strong, and I got soooo many compliments. I had no leaks. Feels great on the skin. Not super floral, a perfect vanilla. Totally worth the money."" —Kc Promising review (for Golden Sky): ""The scent is absolutely divine — sweet, warm, and rich without being overly overpowering. It's the perfect vanilla fragrance that feels both cozy and elegant. I love how natural and smooth it smells, with no artificial or overly sugary notes."" —Tamara Jones Get it from Amazon: Vanilla Bean for $9.99 and Golden Sky for $9.99. 3. L'Oréal Paris BB Cream, a FAST-acting, anti-redness moisturizer with results that feel like legitimate magic — especially considering its competitor, the Dr Jart+ Cicapair Color Correcting Cream, is over twice as expensive. Reviewers especially love this as a base for their makeup, because it leaves skin super soft and primed. Promising review: ""I'd yet to find anything (even foundation) that could cover up my red areas. Checks, chin, nose, and forehead. It comes out green, but has a gorgeous lightweight finish of a tint that indeed covers my redness beautifully. There's no greasiness to it at all. It dries down to a beautiful matte finish. It's super easy to use. I use my fingers. The texture is like silk. It leaves my face baby-soft, not sticky at all. It doesn't settle into my fine lines or wrinkles, and I don't need powder to 'bake' it under my eyes. It also covers the black circles under my eyes."" —Julie F. Get it from Amazon for $9.98 (available in six styles). 4. Olay Super Serum Body Wash that will make anyone with dry or dull skin REJOICE — this is packed with niacinamide, shea butter, and collagen peptides to nourish your skin for 24-hour hydration that will make you feel ~luminous~. (Psst — this is the body wash version of their TikTok-famous, super effective facial Super Serum, so you KNOW they mean business.) Check out a TikTok of the Olay Super Serum Body Wash in action. Promising review: ""I recently tried the Olay Super Serum Body Wash, and I am absolutely in love with it! The formula is incredibly hydrating, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth after every use. It lathers beautifully and has a lovely, light fragrance that isn't overpowering...."

17935233833917816,2025-06-15 21:55:14,en,INSTAGRAM,"  Just sharing a quick routine today with Mixsoon's skincare products: What's in this reel: Cleansing Foam – Made with 32.8% cica extract to soothe irritation, salicylic acid for gentle pore care, and sea algae for hydration. Cleansing Oil – Removes waterproof makeup easily while keeping the skin nourished. It has a noticeable scent, but removes my makeup very well. Centella Essence – 100% centella asiatica. It's been great for calming down inflammation, it absorbs without feeling sticky. Bean Essence – A refreshing step that helps with oil balance and smooth texture. Fermented ingredients include pomegranate, pear, and barley seed. The Master Serum has been the most effective — I love its repairing properties and how it helps clear up my skin gently. I rarely finish skincare products, but this is one I've actually emptied really fast… and I'll definitely repurchase it. The Bean Cream is another favorite. I usually save it for nighttime or when my skin feels extra dry — especially during colder months. It's rich, comforting, and works fast when my skin needs a little extra help. ☀️ Centella Sun Cream – SPF 50+ PA++++, with a soft, non-greasy finish. No white cast, and it's calming enough for sensitive skin thanks to centella and lavender oil. Have you found any skincare products lately that you've actually finished — and would repurchase?

mov_05C888C4030F238A1D049FED88CAD1C5,2025-06-21 16:01:03,en,WEB,"  ⚠️ Warning: Your skin will look and feel amazing after using this warming vitamin C scrub. 1. An Anua pore-clearing cleansing oil that visibly sucks out sebum from your pores and removes makeup residue and blackheads, leaving your skin looking clearer and feeling smoother. Reviewers of all skin types swear by it, including those with acne-prone skin (who say it doesn't cause breakouts)! BTW, a lot of reviewers say they use this as part of their double cleansing routine. As the name implies, double cleansing is a method of cleansing your face twice: first with an oil-based cleanser, and again with a water-based cleanser to help get all the yucky stuff out of your pores. Promising review: ""BEST OIL CLEANSER I SWEAR. I've gone through 3–4 bottles now and it continues to cleanse my skin AMAZING. It melts makeup, clears pores. Honestly it's heaven-sent. The first time I used it, it cleared a lot of my sebum and even now when I use it, it clears any dead skin and dirt I have, even when I don't wear makeup. BUY IT, it's amazing. You can see all the dirt that came out of my face recently in the photo [above, right]."" —rexichor Get it from Amazon for $17.69. 2. A Beauty of Joseon glow serum, aka the secret ingredient to more glass-like skin. This lightweight serum uses rice bran water and 2% alpha-arbutin, a skin-brightening hero that can help fade hyperpigmentation and acne scars. One reviewer said they don't have to wear as much highlighter because their skin was glowing so much, while another swears they don't even need foundation anymore because their skin tone is so even. And don't worry: Even though this is a serum, it won't leave you feeling like you just smeared olive oil over your face. Promising review: ""I love starting my day with this face product! It feels light and refreshing on my skin, and it absorbs quickly without leaving any greasy residue. Since I started using it, my face looks more awake, hydrated, and glowing. It's become an essential part of my morning routine and helps me feel confident all day. Highly recommend for anyone wanting a simple but effective skincare boost!"" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $16.50. 3. The Saem hydrating eye stick, a perfect remedy for dehydrated skin. This eye treatment is made with Icelandic glacier water, giving your skin the fresh hydration boost it needs on days when you've hit the snooze button one too many times. It can also help tighten the appearance of eye wrinkles if you'd prefer for them not to be as noticeable. And here's a tip! It reduces puffiness faster if used after refrigeration. Promising review: ""I'm a 64-year-old woman who has entered the realm of 'mature-aged skin' and I was looking for a stick moisturizer to use around my eyes. I have dark circles and puffiness around my eyes, and I wanted to find something to lighten the dark circles, decrease the puffiness, and hydrate my eye area. This little bear did just that, and I use it every morning and evening. It has helped my eye area quite a bit (better than putting ice cubes on my eyes when I was a teenager). This will not eliminate the dark circles and the puffiness, but it does reduce it. Very nice product and great price point."" —M. Ellis Get it from Amazon for $9.99. 4. Mixsoon Bean Essence that hydrates and exfoliates your skin at the same dang time. This thick (but not sticky) essence contains natural ingredients like fermented bean, barley, and pomegranate to remove dead skin cells and revitalize skin tone. Promising reviews: ""I saw this all over TikTok/Instagram and decided to buy it because I have a lot of sebaceous filaments on my chin and nose. It's a little expensive but I took a gamble: it works! You can physically see the sebaceous filaments come out of your pores, it is not the product bunching up. My problem areas were so much smoother after using and are left with a moisturized glow. I then proceeded to have my boyfriend use this product to see of it worked this good on everyone on the first try and it worked on his nose as well. Amazing stuff "" —Losa Safriwe..."

The formulas are gentle, plant-based, and rooted in the same skin-first approach Mixsoon is known for. It's designed to feel like a reset for your face, using organic ingredients without overwhelming your skin. To be honest, I don't know how much long-term change these masks create—but I did notice immediate results. When the mask said it would brighten or moisturize, it actually did. My skin's been looking dull lately (aging is real), and the brightening mask made me look noticeably more refreshed the same day. I also didn't experience any irritation at all—which is rare for me when it comes to face masks. That alone made it worth trying. mixsoon_usa stackinfluence #mixsoon #mixsoonpartner #koreanskincare #glassskin #skincareroutine #amazon #producttester"

Amazon Prime Day is coming! From July 8th through July 11th, we'll be wading through the mountains of bargains for you to find some of the best deals in every category. For *now*, we're finding the best pre-Prime Day deals and reminding you to sign up for a Prime membership so you can take advantage of the sale! 1. A ridiculously durable, windproof travel umbrella for 40% off with a LIFETIME warranty, making it the true last umbrella you'll ever buy. This uses fiberglass ribs instead of flimsier aluminum, which helps it keep its shape in 70+ MPH winds, and still manages to be super lightweight and compact for travel. Check out a TikTok of the Tumella Umbrella in action. Promising review: ""Why would anyone want to purchase another umbrella with the warranty this one gives? Not like you will need the warranty with this build quality. Almost every umbrella I have owned has five, maybe six, thin metal rods held together with a tiny pin to form the frame. This thing has reinforced ribs, is as light as you can get, looks great, and all at a low price. Yeah, this is all I need."" —E. Smoker Price: $17.99+ (typically $29.99; available in 25 colors and packs of two) 2. A Blink Outdoor 4 Floodlight Camera for 54% off (the best price it's ever been!) that will go a long way toward having peace of mind in your home. This wire-free, drill-free setup features an enhanced motion detection system that will let you see *and* speak through it on the Blink app, with a battery life of two entire years with the included batteries. Promising review: ""The setup is easy to do, and the sensitivity is perfect. I am thoroughly impressed. I wish I had made the change sooner. The cameras are very inconspicuous and extremely capable. My home feels more secure."" —Darnell Lindsay Price: $59.99 (typically $129.98) 3. A Beats Solo 4 headphones for 35% off — full disclosure, these have been and might be 50% off on Prime Day, but this is still enough of a steal that you might want to snag a pair early just in case they sell out the color you want! They flex some GORGEOUS spatial audio, a whopping 50 hours of battery life, and genuine ""all day wear"" comfort — reviewers love how lightweight and wearable these are compared to other brands. Promising review: “Impressive sound, stylish and sophisticated headphones. I personally like how it's not complete noise cancellation since I like to be aware of the environment around me. So this headphone is amazing for the right reasons. Quality, style, sound, and safety. Not to mention how sleek it is. Finally, headphones that are not bulky or heavy. I appreciate the smooth texture, feel, and the cushioned headband part. It's also easy to pair with my Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra. The blue slate color is classy, too! Excellent product!” —Diane Price: $129.95+ (originally $199.99; available in four colors – discount varies per color) 4. A set of thermal-insulated blackout curtains for 37% off to block the sunlight blaring into your home, whether you're trying to take a nap, you need to reduce the glare on your television screen, or you're trying to cut costs on A/C bills and want to keep the house as cool as possible. Promising review: ""Awesome panels and they wash well. I have bought them in different colors for several rooms. They really black out the light, even in the light colors. The dark blue and the dark gray make the room almost like night, even in the daytime, so be warned. I love it for naps!"" —Tati M. Price: $14.44 (typically $23)..."

K-beauty has been dominating the beauty scene thanks to its skin-first philosophy, especially when it comes to sunscreen. Korean sunscreens go beyond basic protection — they hydrate, brighten and help you achieve that signature glow-from-within look. From hydration-packed SPF sticks to silky finishes that layer perfectly under makeup, these SPFs are designed to leave your skin looking radiant — no filter needed. 1. This convenient SPF stick With a sunscreen stick like this one from Belif, there's really no excuse to skip re-application. And why would you? The formula delivers an immediate glow and blurs the look of pores. Plus, the stick format makes it easy to tote around in your bag without the risk of spillage. Get it from Sephora for $28. 2. This watermelon-infused dewy sunscreen Gone are the days of chalky, slow-absorbing sunscreens. If you're looking for something that blends to perfection, look no further than this SPF from fan-favorite Glow Recipe. It's infused with watermelon seed oil, which is full of antioxidants, to prevent oxidative stress. Translation: free radicals don't stand a chance. Get it from Glow Recipe for $35. 3. A skin-soothing pick Skin lean sensitive? Opt for this super soothing formula, which is made with green tea sourced from Jeju Island in South Korea, known for its unique ecosystem. This, plus cica, help to calm irritation and reduce redness — all while protecting the skin from the UVA and UVB rays. Get it from Amazon for $18+ (available in two sizes). 4. This two-in-one formula From South Korea-based brand The Face Shop comes this dual-action sunscreen. It's formulated to not just protect from damaging rays, but to also hydrate the skin so you can skip your morning moisturizer. How's that for efficiency? Get it from Amazon for $18. 5. This antioxidant-rich luxury option Chasing luxury? This hard-working formula provides a smooth, hydrating finish without leaving a white cast, making it suitable for daily use and as a base under makeup. It's made with Korean white ginseng to protect from environmental aggressors — plus, a blend of five herbals work to moisturize and balance skin. Get it from Sephora for $75. 6. A creamy, whitecast-free formula Creamy and goopy are often synonymous when it comes to sunscreen formulas, but that's not the case with this quick-absorbing option from Mixsoon. It glides on seamlessly and blends even easier, providing a nice hydrating base for the rest of your skincare. Get it from Amazon for $15. 7. This lightweight, radiant finish SPF A pioneer in K-beauty, Dr. Jart's science-first approach means you're getting the best of the best when it comes to sun protection. This SPF 50 formula has a liquid-y texture for a smooth application and lightweight coverage — perfect for all skin types, oily included. Get it from Amazon for $44. 8. A green tea sunscreen You know the brand for their playful aesthetics and effective sheet masks, but this sunscreen from Tonymoly will quickly earn top-tier status in your skincare drawer. The reason lies in the 0.5% green tea extract, which protects against sun damage, pollution and skin aging...."

I believe someone had left it at my house from a party. I loved that bowl and used it all the time. After 10 years of use, it was time to say goodbye.

Promising review: ""I saw this all over TikTok/Instagram and decided to buy it because I have a lot of sebaceous filaments on my chin and nose. It's a little expensive but I took a gamble: it works! You can physically see the sebaceous filaments come out of your pores; it is not the product bunching up. My problem areas were so much smoother after using and were left with a moisturized glow. I then proceeded to have my boyfriend use this product to see if it worked this well on everyone on the first try, and it worked on his nose as well. Amazing stuff.

For *now*, we're finding the best pre-Prime Day deals and reminding you to sign up for a Prime membership so you can take advantage of the sale! 1. Y0140 iRobot Roomba for 49% off (the best price yet) because if robots are gonna steal our jobs, it might as well be the bad ones. This bagless machine vacuums AND mops at the same time with a special brush, meaning you might actually have clean floors for once. Promising review: ""I love this robot. We got this because our baby is constantly on the floor, so we just wanted a little extra help with keeping the floors clean. We run it every night, and seeing how much it picks up blows our mind. We have two dogs, so dog hair and Cheerios are mainly what we get, but it has definitely made a difference with our floors on top of what we already do to keep our floors clean. Highly recommend. We have vinyl wood floors, so it runs fine on it, but it can go on carpet as well. We just leave the room doors closed because it is very loud when it runs and we don't want it to come into the rooms."" —Makayla Price: $139.99 (originally $274; also available in two other styles for a different or no discount) 2. A super cute one-piece swimsuit for up to 50% off with ruched details and a fun cut-out design that will have people falling over themselves to compliment you. Just remind them there's no running by the pool after you brag that you scored it at its lowest price ever. Promising reviews: ""I had to come on here and rave about this bathing suit. I NEVER leave reviews. I have literally tried at least 10 bathing suits from different stores including Amazon due to postpartum. This bathing suit is IT. The ruching is in the right places, and the cut of the bathing suit is so nice. I love that it looks like a two-piece. Get it!"" —Ruby B. ""The best one-piece swimsuit I've ever worn! So comfy and the fit is so chic. Great suit for the price!"" —Leslie Price: $19.99+ (typically $39.99; available in sizes XS–XXL and 17 styles) 3. A lightning-fast ionic hair dryer and diffuser for 50% off reviewers say will dry your hair faster than you can text your friend ""leaving now."" It comes with two nozzles for straight and curly hair, so this quiet, lightweight dryer is kind of a must-buy. Promising review: ""The 150,000 RPM motor is incredibly powerful — it dries my thick, shoulder-length hair in under 5 minutes. This is a huge time-saver, especially on busy mornings. My hair feels smoother, shinier, and far less frizzy after each use. No more static flyaways either. This dryer is surprisingly lightweight and compact without sacrificing performance. It's easy to handle, and it doesn't take up much space in my travel bag. It easily rivals more expensive salon brands at a fraction of the price."" —Amazon Customer Price: $59.99 (typically $119.99; available in two colors) 4. Quick-dry retractable gel pens for 36% off perfect for bullet journalers, dedicated color coders, and type A+ people looking for a superior writing utensil option.

Not only will this stuff leave you with a perfect sun-kissed glow, but it also contains glycerin to hydrate the skin barrier and vitamin E to soften the skin and smooth texture! Promising review: ""I love this so I ordered a second for backup! Depending on my day, I will add no more than one or two drops to my moisturizer or my primer. Takes away the winter pallor of my face, which definitely has not had enough sun lately. The bottle is small, but you don't need to use much. Reasonably priced for the amount. I would say buy it."" —Incognito Get it from Amazon for $5.99. 2. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder to instantly matte-ify your skin while helping it maintain its natural glow thanks to the blue hyaluronic acid. It even comes in a mess-free, travel-friendly case so you can take it on the go. That's a major upgrade to your routine, if I do say so myself. Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""I loved this setting powder, it blurred my pores and blended my makeup so well that even my husband noticed. Wow! I will be buying more before people find it and sell it all out, hehehe."" —Charlotte Laim Get it from Amazon for $25. 3. OR Catrice's Magic Shine Eraser if the *final* step in your skincare regimen involves trying literally anything and everything to prevent that unwanted oily layer from showing up uninvited. This gel-to-powder formula will help smooth, mattify, and refine your skin for a flawless blurring effect that'll feel like you're walking around with a filter on your face! It's compact enough to pop in your bag and take with you when you're traveling. This vegan, cruelty-free formula is free from parabens, fragrance, phthalates, alcohol, oil, preservatives, paraffin, and talc. Promising review: ""Does exactly what it says. Removes shine and gives a soft-focus effect to the makeup. Perfect for when you've been busy and your makeup is a little shiny in places. Doesn't change the color or texture of the makeup either or risk spilling or cracking like powder. A+"" —TheWildSide Get it from Amazon for $8. 4. A hair identifier spray because if dermaplaning has become an essential step in your routine, this stuff is about to change the game. This spray will lower your chances of missing a spot, and reviewers even say it left their skin feeling baby smooth because it helps the razor glide across the skin more easily! It comes with one bottle of hair identifier spray and four razors! Promising review: ""The power of the hair identifier's spray is unmatched. Once you spray in any direction that has hair, it automatically identifies the hair that needs to be removed. It is easily sprayed on and easily wiped off. No extra residue. Comes with four blades, and I say these blades are soft and gentle yet get the job done. Not sure why no one ever thought of coming up with a hair identifier spray. Great value and smells like baby powder. Great quality."" —Karine Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in multipacks). 5. Sol De Janeiro's Delicia Drench Body Butter that'll shower you with fast-absorbing moisture that lasts all day long while working to improve your skin barrier. It also smells downright delightful, like the Cheirosa 59 body mist, to be exact —  if you don't know, it's a tantalizing blend of vanilla orchid, sugared violet, and sandalwood...."

A ridiculously versatile solar-powered bird bath fountain pump — all you have to do is plop it in water in a traditional bird bath, planter, or backyard decor, and boom! You have a sweet little bird haven that can burble water up to a foot high for all our feathered friends to enjoy. Solatec is a small business that specializes in solar-powered outdoor products. Promising review: ""This is a fantastic little fountain with very good power. I shoots up to 12 inches in the air in direct sun. For $10 I cannot understand how it can be made and shipped."" —Ben Phillips Get it from Amazon for $10.29. 2. Moroccanoil's Mini Must-Haves Sampler, which is so affordable that I'm not not pinching myself to make sure I'm awake. Reviewers especially love these teensy versions for traveling in ~luxury~ on the cheap, and for trying these beloved splurgeworthy products without committing to the whole price first! This handy travel set includes deluxe sample sizes of Moroccanoil hair treatment, shampoo, conditioner, styling cream, and shower gel. Promising review: ""I thought this promotion was fake, but I ordered it hoping I'd get a good product — and I did! OMG! If you're thinking about trying Moroccanoil, you can totally start with these minis to see if they work for you. And let me tell you, these products are 100% recommended! They're perfect as a gift or just for your own use. So worth it!"" —Alehandra Get it from Amazon for $10. 3. A clever magnetic two-layer fridge shelf so roomy and useful that your fruit bowl will be like ""Excuse me? What is SHE doing here??"" Reviewers are especially impressed with how strong the magnet is on these, and how much space it saves them! Promising review: ""OMG. This was a worthy investment. I can't tell you how many people ask about these baskets when they visit my house. If you are into the farmhouse vibes, these are the perfect addition. I hate storing things on my counter, but I love that I can always keep fresh fruit and veggies from the store or garden readily available. The kids love that it is easy to get to, and I am incredibly surprised by how strong the magnet is. I have another one in the coffee nook on the other side of the fridge that holds the coffee pods and seasonings. Love how this has saved me space."" —HereIAm Get it from Amazon for $22.98 (available in three colors). 4. Olay's Firming Body Lotion full of collagen peptides and a Vitamin B3 complex for *ultra* hydration designed to visibly plump, firm, and moisturize your skin — all at a fraction of the price of other firming lotions, like the internet's beloved $48 Elasti-Cream. Psst — there's a matching elasticity-boosting collagen body wash as well! Promising review: ""I have spent a lifetime looking for a lotion as good as this one. I am so happy to have tried this, and now I will use it forever. It smells fantastic, comes in a cute bottle, is reasonably priced, and my skin is softer and more hydrated than ever. I've tried everything for dry, itchy, sensitive skin. I use this daily, and I love it. Butters and oils leave me feeling gross and greasy, and most lotions simply do not do the job, and I'll have to reapply constantly. This I apply once daily, and my skin is so soft and healthy now."" —Paige Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in four other styles). 5. Marshmallow Blush Perfume, a romantic, soft scent that has taken TikTok by STORM for this summer — reviewers are obsessed with how beautifully this strawberry-leaning scent blends vanilla, floral, and fruity notes for the ultimate summer vibe...."

Mixsoon大豆精华，我是在Markham的Costco发现它的，因为很少用日韩的护肤产品，所以对这个品牌完全没了解。 这款大豆精华，看着水水润润💦的，开始以为它是偏油一些的质地，但它其实是粘稠的会拉丝的精华！ 还挺神奇的🤣 涂抹的时候流动性特别好，据说用它按摩黑头和角质多的部位，可以把皮肤里的角质和油脂就都揉出来，但我尝试了一下，用肉眼观察，没有发现揉出什么角质🥹😅 难道是我的角质黑头不够多？？ 我个人用了几周下来，感觉皮肤亮了一些，虽然拉丝，但是完全没有黏腻感，挺好吸收的，而且不影响后续的护肤，再用其他面霜和精华的话也不会搓泥油腻。 我一般晚上用它，或者叠加Darphin朵梵的双生精华，目前感觉它还算是一个还不错的精华！ 买来尝试一下，完全不亏[赞R]

It glides on, but the best part is that it doubles as a moisturizer! It's two of your skincare steps in one, and it's super moisturizing. No white cast, great for your face. I'm sure you know that sunscreen DAILY is the best thing you can do for your skin. The price is better than the expensive US brands. Korea sunscreens have UVA and UVB filters. The FDA hasn't approved any new sunscreen ingredients since 1999, but Korean beauty has, and it can be sold on Amazon.

18069223444843562,2025-07-05 22:30:08,en,INSTAGRAM,"  Lately, I've been more intentional about what goes into my skincare routine, especially when it comes to cleansing. Mixsoon, a premium Korean brand known for its minimalist 3-layer skincare philosophy, caught my attention. Their Cleansing Oil is enriched with fermented ingredients like soybean, barley, pomegranate, and pear—designed to deeply cleanse without irritating sensitive skin. I specifically picked this up for days when I wear heavier makeup—those times when a foaming cleanser alone doesn't quite get the job done. I wanted something that would effectively remove makeup without over-stripping or irritating my skin. This oil cleanser did just that—it melted everything away while leaving my skin soft and my eyelashes intact. The only thing that didn't quite work for me was the fragrance. It's subtle and not unpleasant, but I tend to be sensitive to artificial scents. Otherwise, it's been a solid addition to my routine. mixsoon_usa stackinfluence #mixsoon #mixsoonpartner #koreanskincare #glassskin #skincareroutine #amazonproducttester #amazonfinds #ecommerce #amazoninfluencer"

If you missed my last post, here's the quick rundown: they're a Korean skincare brand that takes a less-is-more approach, using fermented botanicals and clean formulations to deliver glass-skin results. This Galactomyces Ferment Essence isn't so much about exfoliating as it is about calming and refining the skin. With fermented sake at its core, it helps even out texture, minimize the look of pores, and support collagen production—which becomes increasingly important in your 30s. I also appreciate that it doesn't have any strong fragrances, and on the days I use it, I've noticed my skin looks a little less red and more balanced overall. I'll share more updates as I continue using it. mixsoon_usa stackinfluence #mixsoon #mixsoonpartner #koreanskincare #glassskin #skincareroutine #amazon #ecommerce #producttester #amazoninfluencer"

We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder for 30% off (the first time it's been on sale since it launched, and LOWEST price it's ever been) to absorb oil and blur pores so effectively that you'll be like, ""Oh ... witchcraft??"" Might be the only explanation for how this can matte-ify your complexion while still keeping it radiant and glowy. ✨ Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""I loved this setting powder, it blurred my pores and blended my makeup so well that even my husband noticed. Wow! I will be buying more before people find it and sell it all out, hehehe."" —Charlotte Laim Price: $17.50 (typically $25) 2. Clinique Almost Lipstick Tinted Lip Balm in Black Honey for 30% off you're definitely going to want to stock up on *now*, before TikTokers go feral again (guilty as charged). This cult-classic, lightweight, slightly glossy shade is beyond ""holy grail"" status — it matches skin tones so beautifully that I'm personally starting to suspect witchcraft, after seeing so many TikToks of it subtly transforming entire beauty looks with just a few swipes. I was very adamant about not buying this for the longest time because I am stubborn about ""expensive"" beauty products, but this is worth every penny and then some. It's so lightweight and layerable, it's foolproof to apply, and I have yet to wear a single outfit it doesn't complement??? I love watching it instantly elevate a casual look or add simple elegance to dressy ones. I wear it every day now, and after weeks of use, I've barely made a dent. Also, and maybe this is just me, but I tend to get pigment on my teeth with a lot of lip products, and I've simply never had an issue with this magic stick. Anyway, watch this TikTok of someone using it on their lips AND cheeks, because I did and oops, this lipstick FELL into my cart. Promising review: ""This lipstick is a game changer. It goes on and stays on well. It is pretty sheer, but buildable. I have trouble with most red lipsticks turning pink after a bit. So, I will put this over my other colors, and it absolutely makes a difference. It's a great staple to keep in your cosmetic bag. It is something I will definitely buy again. You should absolutely try it!"" —Amy H. Price: $17.50 (originally $25; also available in pink honey!) 3. A pack of Crest 3D Whitestrips for 35% off so you can channel Chip Skylark and belt out ""My Shiny Teeth And Me"" wherever you roam. It comes with 44 strips total, which is enough for 20 regular treatments and two one-hour express treatments. Check out a TikTok of the Crest 3D Whitestrips in action. Promising review: ""I haven't used Crest White Strips in over five years. Since then, my teeth have stayed really white, and I frequently get compliments or questions about how I got my teeth so white. I decided to get a box to boost the whiteness of my teeth. Wow, I was shocked at how much these have improved! Before, the strips were really flimsy, hard to remove from the package, and really hard to keep on your teeth — the old ones would slip or bunch up. These are such an improvement! The new strips remove easily from the plastic they are on. The strips are REALLY adhesive! These will not budge!..."

mov_FC1A2C140F1B6D89056DB900484EEC04,2025-07-09 19:48:23,en,WEB,"  Post Prime Day, you can have your overpriced coffee back — deal? Amazon Prime Day is here! There are more deals than you could ever begin to look through on your own...so that's where we come in. We waded through the mountains of bargains for you and found some of the best deals in every category. FYI — deals move *fast*. We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. The TikTok-viral Tirtir cushion foundation — for 60% off, a new lowest-ever price! — that offers 72 hours of flawless wear, blending seamlessly to hide redness, blemishes, and under-eye bags. It has buildable coverage, perfect for a natural look or full glam. Plus, it's packed with hibiscus and red propolis extracts for a boost in skin elasticity. And to top it all off, its oval-shaped puff can reach every little corner of your face. Check out this TikTok of Mikayla Nogueira's review of this foundation. Promising review: ""I struggle with finding a foundation that's not orange. Someone recommended I try a Korean product, and this started going viral around the same time. I lucked into a perfect color match on the first try, but I've learned there are sample packs if you aren't sure about the color. The coverage is incredible. It was very lightweight, not heavy at all. It did settle into my under-eye wrinkles without primer, so if you're older, that's something to keep in mind. Overall, beautiful and long-lasting. This will be my go-to foundation from now on."" —AJ Bond Price: $10 (originally $25; available in 40 shades and a mini size) 2. A ""Gracula"" garlic crusher for 57% off, because you know what? If a 108-year-old vampire lurking moodily in the trees in the Pacific Northwest isn't going to fall in love with you and grant you immortality, one might as well make your life in the kitchen a little easier. Promising review: ""I love this little guy. I found him on a BuzzFeed list and had to have it as soon as I saw it! I've minced as many as five cloves in it in seconds. It's a little tricky getting all of the garlic out once minced (I use a silicone basting brush to get most of it, but I always use more than the recipe calls for anyway, so it's not a deal breaker). Cleanup is a breeze because he goes right in the dishwasher!"" —Barbie Price: $9.95 (typically $18.99) 3. Mixsoon Bean Essence for 55% off (the lowest price it's ever been!!) — this TikTok-beloved K-beauty staple for exfoliating and hydrating is a secret weapon that anyone chasing the ~glass skin~ look will want to know about immediately. You can use this as a low-maintenance, high results exfoliant by massaging it into your skin two to three times a week for a smoother, brighter, more even complexion. Promising reviews: ""I saw this all over TikTok/Instagram and decided to buy it because I have a lot of sebaceous filaments on my chin and nose. It's a little expensive but I took a gamble: it works! You can physically see the sebaceous filaments come out of your pores; it is not the product bunching up. My problem areas were so much smoother after using and were left with a moisturized glow. I then proceeded to have my boyfriend use this product to see if it worked this well on everyone on the first try, and it worked on his nose as well. Amazing stuff. "" —Losa ""I have hyperpigmentation and oily skin. I feel this product regulates my oil production and it helps my makeup look so flawless. 10/10."" —MissKayMae..."

That's right, it's the final Amazon Prime Day, which means all the Korean beauty steals you've been eyeing will disappear after the clock strikes midnight (very Cinderella-core—am I right?) . Whether you open a tab to sleuth-shop at work or make a deciding move on a late-night scroll, there's still plenty of glowy skin-care products and innovative new makeup formulas up for grabs. And while Amazon likes to lean into its reputation of being the “Everything Store,” a targeted approach to scoping out the best Prime Day deals always pays off. Those shopping the beauty aisle should make the Prime Day K-beauty deals their first port of call. Why, you ask? Korean beauty products are renowned for their innovative formulas, skincare-first ingredients, and unique textures—in addition to being just an absolute treat to use and hold. From jelly-like serums and and whipped moisturizers that melt into skin to cushion compacts that snap shut with a satisfying click, there's a tactile delight to every step. Plus, who doesn't delight at super cute packaging? Korean beauty products are often not only wildly effective, but can also spark a bit of joy with each use. Vogue's Guide to the Best Discounted Amazon K-Beauty Products: Featured in this article Best Eye Cream Sulwhasoo Concentrated Ginseng Rejuvenating Eye Cream Jump to review “K-beauty revolves around nurturing [the skin] barrier–optimizing the hydration within and blocking out pollutants and environmental stressors,” Dr. Christine Hall, a general practitioner in medical aesthetics, previously told Vogue. “The whole regime centers around maximizing hydration of the skin or 'skin flooding' with product after product aimed at restoring the skin barrier and locking in hydration—no matter what your skin-type is.” It's hard to keep up with every single markdown that pops up at the 11th hour—but we're staying vigilant on all the K-beauty steals. In other words: we're doing the obsessive scrolling, so you have the pick of the lot. We've rounded up over 80 curated options of top-tier Korean beauty buys (plus a few new obsessions) to choose from right here, so all you have to do is tap “add to cart.” Happy shopping! The Best Prime Day Beauty Deals, By Category Sometimes you want to peruse the Amazon Prime Day deals, other times, you know exactly what you're looking for. To help you quickly find a specific item, we've broken our guide into categories below. Prime Day Korean Cleanser Deals The best Korean face washes typically focus on soothing, gentle ingredients. Whether you're opting for a cleansing oil to melt away makeup and SPF, or a hydrating foaming cleanser—either make a great first step in any routine. Though, ideally, you'll do both as part of the Korean cleansing method, a.k.a the lauded double cleanse. From balms to low ph gel, anyone of these picks will give you an effective cleanse, sans irritation. Banila Co Clean it Zero Original Cleansing Balm This pick was Vogue beauty shopping writer Conçetta Ciarlo's intro into the K-Beauty world back in her university days, before the category fully broke mainstream in the US. “A radom Amazon purchase in 2017 turned into a consistant favorite for me—just one scoop of the whipped-texture product lathers effortlessy, removing waterproof makeup with ease,” she says. CosRx Low pH Good Morning Gel Face Cleanser This gel cleanser is safe for all skin types to use, helping maintain the barrier rather than stripping it. Its pH-balanced and contains tea tree oil and BHA to soothe the skin and banish breakouts. Sulwhasoo Board-certified dermatologist Dr. Christina Chung is a fan of this gentle cleanser, noting that it's become a favorite for everyone in her family, from teens to elders. “Sulwhasoo products are generally ginseng-based and fabulous for sensitive skin types,” she previously told Vogue. Anua Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil Chock full of anti-inflammatory, antibacterial ingredients like turmeric and heartland extract, this cleansing oil soothes while removing makeup and SPF.
