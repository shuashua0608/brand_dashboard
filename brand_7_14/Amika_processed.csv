Nela, ele o parabenizou e explicou que seu desabafo anterior não era sobre ele, mas sobre a Academia responsável pelo Grammy. Ele também incluiu três emojis diferentes, incluindo uma pessoa encolhendo os ombros, mãos rezando e um coração vermelho, que foram adicionados sobre a foto. “Parabéns meu irmão.. Eu gostaria de me desculpar se você se ofendeu com minha reação no Grammy”, escreveu Chris na mensagem. “Você não era o alvo pretendido e sei que fui muito rude e maldoso. “Depois de fazer minha pesquisa, eu realmente acho o seu [sic] incrível. A ORGANIZAÇÃO NÃO ESTÁ FAZENDO NÓS NEGROS NOSSA DEVIDA DILIGÊNCIA. VOCÊ E EU nunca DEVEMOS estar na mesma categoria [y].. duas vibrações e gêneros totalmente diferentes. “Então, de um homem negro para outro… PARABÉNS”, acrescentou. “ESPERO QUE VOCÊ POSSA ALIMENTAR SUA FAMÍLIA PARA TODA A VIDA. Deus abençoe meu G.” (ORIGINAL) Chris Brown está sacudindo sua decepção sobre uma grande perda no Grammy com um pequeno vôo em um jato particular. A cantora de “Run It”, de 33 anos, levou para Instagram na segunda-feira, 6 de fevereiro, para posar ao lado de seu filho de três anos Aeko Catori Brown enquanto os dois embarcavam em um luxuoso jato particular. 'Eu e meu homem principal pronto para a turnê”, ele legendou a foto, ao lado de um emoji de coração. Na foto, Chris usava preto da cabeça aos pés com sandálias brancas e meias brancas. Ele também balançou um boné de beisebol preto enquanto se inclinava para seu filho. Veja esta postagem no Instagram Uma postagem compartilhada por BROWN (@chrisbrownofficial) Dele filho sósia Aeko parecia pronto para negócios sérios enquanto usava calças esportivas vermelhas, um top esbranquiçado e tênis de cano alto. O pequeno, com quem Chris divide Amika Harris , adoravelmente agarrou o colarinho de seu pai famoso para a foto, mantendo-o perto. A foto vem um dia depois que ele foi às histórias do IG para explodir o Grammy Awards depois que ele perdeu o Melhor Álbum de R&B para o pianista Robert Glasper na cerimônia de 5 de fevereiro. Muitos dos 131 milhões de seguidores da estrela na plataforma correram para o tópico de comentários para mostrar seu apoio. “Chris Brown é o Michael JACKSON Of MY Era ima [sic] Continue a dizer que seu impacto nas pessoas é REAL ”, escreveu um seguidor. “Sempre amaremos Chris com ou sem Grammy”, comentou outro. “O melhor da geração dele sem dúvida”, comentou um terceiro. Chris Brown e seu filho Aeko (SOUTHPAW / BACKGRID) Outros estavam lá pela aparição adorável ao lado de Aeko. “ Fazendo memórias por toda a vida! Muito fofo!' reagiu um fã, ao lado de emojis de coração. “Vá buscá-los, Chris, com Aeko no convés, faça uma turnê segura e bem-sucedida”, escreveu outro. 'Nós te amamos !' O Sob a influência A turnê começa em Dublin, na Irlanda, em 11 de fevereiro. Mas mesmo uma série de aparições em shows de alto nível não conseguiu amortecer o impacto de sua derrota na noite de domingo, e a estrela não teve nenhum problema em deixar seus fãs saberem como ele se sentia. “Mano, quem diabos é esse? Vocês estão tocando”, escreveu ele em um slide após o evento, e em outro fez referência às habilidades de piano de Robert. “Eu tenho que melhorar minhas habilidades”, ele também escreveu. “Vou começar a tocar gaita.” Clique para se inscrever para receber nosso boletim informativo diário gratuito do HollywoodLife para obter as notícias mais quentes sobre celebridades."

18362401033151238,2025-06-16 17:32:11,en,INSTAGRAM,  I get asked allllll the time how I get my hair like this! So here is a quick video on how. The tool is the 'Bed Head Waver' and you can get it on Amazon for like 20 bucks! Yes it can steam sometimes but it's just bc of the product I put on my hair it's not burning my hair Here are a couple steps to make sure your hair stays healthy and looks good after: 1. Always use a heat protectant- my favorite is the Olaplex #6 2. I use it on medium heat or lower 3. After I finish I like to coat my hair in a serum- my fave is the Amika serum. 4. Start about 4 fingers from the scalp 5. If it feels too big I promise the next day it's my favorite- so sometimes I like to do it at night and then sleep in it. Happy Crimping!! #crimpinghair #wavyhair #hairstyles #amika #olaplex

1ld9htg,2025-06-17 00:33:11,en,REDDIT,"  Hi everyone. I'm looking for some recommendations of dry shampoo that are affordable. Recently I tried the living proof phd dry shampoo advanced (the silver one) and I really didn't like it, left my hair feeling tangled and with a lot of buildup. I'm new to dry shampoo, I've never used it in my hole life. So, bring your best recommendations and tips. I've heard that the amika one is good, but since the living proof one for me was a fail, I'm a little scared on splurging on something that won't work."
my6yw0n,2025-06-17 02:11:00,en,REDDIT,"  I hated the amika one… didn't work for me, neither did living proof. DAE has a lovely one, smells great and a bottle lasts me about 3-4 months… my favourite one I've found is called tap secret… you can find it on amazon. Definitely will have some buildup but it adds some volume and it's pretty easy to use with no mess."

mym0ohj,2025-06-19 11:03:33,en,REDDIT,"  Part of this is definitely product. What you listed never works for my hair, it's heavy and leaves it looking flat or too fluffy and without much curl The best thing that's worked for me is a leave in conditioner (the hydrating one from amika is good, it's blue, whatever you choose, ulta is your friend here) and a strong curling gel (right now I use not your mothers) Shower, brush the leave in through, put the gel all over, and then flip and use a t-shirt to scrunch. Flip back, keep scrunching with it and whatever's not quite right, finger curl, let air dry. If it's extra humid out there I'll create an even thicker cast with a mousse. Don't touch your hair after all this is in, once it's dry if you want to remove some of the stiffness just scrunch it with a bit of argan oil, but usually for me that cast fights super humid weather Using a t-shirt has reduced my frizz significantly. Depending on the thickness of your hair you'll need a decent amount of gel/mousse (don't be scared of this) Overnight braids also give a great look on day 2 and 3"

AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, is a lobby group focused on strengthening the U.S.-Israel relationship. Their agenda centers around promoting policies that enhance the security of both nations, ensuring Israel's safety and fostering cooperation across various sectors. AIPAC's key goals include advocating for security assistance to Israel, countering Iran's nuclear ambitions and regional aggression, and promoting a two-state solution for peace between Israel and the Palestinians. Here's a more detailed breakdown:
1. Strengthening the U.S.-Israel Relationship:
AIPAC works to solidify the alliance between the United States and Israel, emphasizing shared values and strategic cooperation. They support robust foreign aid and government partnerships, including joint efforts in anti-terrorism, technology, and other crucial areas. AIPAC encourages strategic cooperation in areas like technology, energy, cybersecurity, and intelligence sharing. 2. Ensuring Israel's Security:
AIPAC actively advocates for security assistance to Israel, including funding for missile defense systems. They prioritize maintaining Israel's Qualitative Military Edge (QME). AIPAC opposes efforts to boycott, sanction, or divest from Israel. They work to counter threats from Iran, including its nuclear program and regional aggression. 3. Promoting Peace:
AIPAC supports a negotiated two-state solution, with a secure Jewish state of Israel living alongside a demilitarized Palestinian state. They back initiatives that normalize relations between Israel and Arab states. 4. Engaging in the Political Process:
AIPAC encourages pro-Israel Americans to participate in the political process and support candidates who align with their goals. They provide research and information to policymakers on issues related to the U.S.-Israel relationship. While AIPAC is not a political action committee and does not endorse candidates, they do support pro-Israel policies through various means. THEY LOBBY SENATOR'S $100 MILLION A TIME TO PUSH THEIR INTERESTS. WHERE DOES ISRAEL GET ITS FUNDING? Listed below are some of where Israel gets its funding from to support its genocide. If you are not supporter of genocide. You might consider boycotting the companies, products and services. Some of which are listed below.

tw_sl_54b3808ef424a00edab1a4cf94dbe0b7,2025-06-20 14:38:14,en,WEB,"  Curious about thermal brushes? Here's what they can and can't do for your hair, and which ones are worth buying. You've seen thermal brushes before, maybe touted as a blow-out brush or an infrared brush. The best thermal brush for you will recreate a blow-out type of look on your dry hair—different than a blow-dry brush, which is designed for wet hair but has a similar look. It reminds me of how I would use a curler in my youth to straighten while adding a little body to the roots and a little curl to the ends. If that's your preferred hairstyle too, then these are the devices for you. Thermal brushes use a different type of heat than your usual hair tools. Rather than blowing hot air or pressing heated plates onto your head, a thermal brush uses infrared heat to warm the hair from the inside out. That style of heat does a good job of locking in moisture compared to other tools, but it can give different results depending on your hair type. It can also be tricky to nail the motion with these devices to create blow-out volume. Even if you don't get the volume you hoped for on your first try, these brushes are great for smoothing out and controlling day-two hair while you learn the method. The best thermal brush I've tried is the Wavytalk Heatwave Pro ($80), which comes with three different heads you can switch out, allowing for the most styling flexibility. It has five heat temperature settings, too, making it easy to achieve your perfect brush size and heat level for your hair type and intended style. My personal favorite single brush is the Amika Blowout Babe Thermal Round Brush ($100), since I like the easy toggle control, but the Sutra Infrared Thermal Styling Brush ($110) is a good choice for a single brush with five heat options to choose from. Curious for more information about thermal brushes? Head down to the Frequently Asked Questions section below to learn how the technology works, how to get the best blow-out look with them, and more. Looking for more hair tools and tips? Check out our guides to the Best Blow-Dry Brushes, Best Hair Straighteners, Best Hair Dryers, and Best Heat Protectant Sprays. AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevron Best Thermal Brush Courtesy of Wavytalk Photograph: Nena Farrell Photograph: Nena Farrell Photograph: Nena Farrell 01 Heatwave Pro Thermal Set The best thermal brush I've tried is actually a set. The Wavytalk Heatwave Pro comes with three different thermal heads you can switch out to choose the best size for the hairstyle you want. There's a little digital screen on the handle, with a power button and temperature button that lets you toggle between the five temperature settings. It ranges from 300 degrees up to 420 degrees Fahrenheit, with most of the heat options in the 300 range. The thermal heads come in the following sizes: 1.2 inches, 1.5 inches, and 1.75 inches. Each one has different strengths. The smallest size is great if you want a curler effect, while the larger sizes are good for smoother blow-out waves or a clean C-shape to your hair. Even with shoulder-length hair, I've been able to take advantage of the different sizes to get the exact results I'm looking for. It's a great set, and it's often on sale on Amazon, often also including a carrying case and some extra accessories like a heat glove and hair clips. SettingsFive heat settings between 300 and 420 degrees FahrenheitWhat's includedBrush base and three thermal heads (1.2 inches, 1.5 inches, and 1.75 inches). Amazon set comes with case and accessoriesWarrantyOne-year warranty Another Good Thermal Brush Courtesy of Sutra Photograph: Nena Farrell Photograph: Nena Farrell 02 Infrared Thermal Round Brush Sutra's Infrared Thermal Styling Brush has a design similar to our top pick, the Wavytalk, but instead of having two buttons, there's a single power button that you can hold down to turn on and off, or tap to toggle between the five heat settings. The button is easy to tap while you're using it, but it won't change the heat settings right away, so it's not the worst thing if you find yourself accidentally pressing it. It reaches the highest heat level of the thermal brushes I've tested, making it a good choice for unruly hair that needs higher heat to corral it. It does a good job smoothing my frizzy, curly hair after I air dry it, or reviving my DIY blowout the day after I use a blow-dry brush. I would prefer better controls, but it's worked well for me for months. I have the 43-millimeter option (which is about 1.7 inches), which has been a nice oval size for a classic blowout look, but Sutra also has a smaller, rounded 32-mm brush ($110) if that's more your style.

Personally, I always use used World Nomads. After 15+ countries, they're still just as reliable! Get a Quote Portugal is the 7th safest country in the world [source]. Things can still happen, though. Injuries, lost bags, missed flights. Getting travel insurance is a choice only you can make, but it makes me feel more secure. Personally, I choose to get travel insurance even in a safe country like Portugal. World Nomads has been my go-to when it comes to travel insurance, and I would never start packing without it.International Charging Adapter Our Pick Ceptics World International Travel Plug Adapter I've tried a lot of international charging adapters over the years, but I recently discovered a new favorite with the Ceptics brand. I can use it for everything from my phone to my laptop. View on Amazon You won't really think about putting an international charging adapter on your packing list until you forget it. Once that happens, it can be a domino effect of annoying circumstances afterward. I won't go on a trip abroad without the Ceptics World International Travel Plug Adapter anymore. It works anywhere in the world and can accommodate pretty much every type of gadget.Small Day Pack Our Pick Osprey Arcane Small Day Pack I'm obsessed with Osprey's adorable Arcane day pack. It's very simple and sleek, but it still has all the functionality you need in a smaller day bag. View on Osprey Whether you're spending a day at the beach or exploring the mountainous wine country, your small day pack will be a core part of every excursion in Portugal. I promise you it's nice to have a bag that's bigger than a handbag but smaller than your main backpack. Osprey carries lots of daypacks that can get the job done, like the high-quality Arcane small day pack. Its simple design is stylish but effective. It comes complete with a laptop sleeve and a self-locking security hook as an anti-theft measure.Packing Cubes Our Pick Well Traveled Packing Cubes These Well Traveled packing cubes make it 100X easier to fit all your stuff in a bag. This brand is my favorite because they allow you to actually smooth your clothes down flat. View on Amazon Packing cubes have completely revolutionized travel for me. They save space and make it effortless to organize it all. However, not all packing cubes are created equal. Trust me, I've had a cube or two break in the worst possible moment. Thankfully, I know I can always trust these Well Traveled compression packing cubes. They're very durable and squeeze down to nearly flat.Dry Shampoo Our Pick Amika Perk Up Dry Shampoo The Amika dry shampoo will be your best friend after the beach. On those days when you need to fix your hair after baking under the Portuguese sun, all you need is a little spritz. View on Amazon Dry shampoo is a total lifesaver when you need to freshen up your hair but don't want to take a whole shower. Just a spray or two and you're grease-free for another few hours. My favorite one on the market right now is the Amika perk-up dry shampoo. It doesn't have that nasty, pasty residue that a lot of dry shampoos leave behind. Quick-Dry Travel Towel Our Pick Rainleaf Microfiber Towel This lightweight Rainleaf towel is way more convenient than a heavy & wet beach towel. It dries fast and is super high-quality so you don't have to worry about it fraying. View on Amazon Whether you stay in an Airbnb or a hotel, most places in Portugal will specify that you can't use their towels at the beach. So, what are your options? Buy a huge beach towel and lug it around, or go without one at all? My suggestion is that you bring along a lightweight, easy-to-carry Rainleaf microfiber towel. Rainleaf towels dry in minutes after use and come with a little bag making them very convenient to pack.

1lqzqi6,2025-07-03 20:17:41,en,REDDIT,"  ! [img](9fapcy00vpaf1) Hi all! I wanted to share my growth journey and haircare routine as I heal from a bixie gone wrong and grow out a cut and color. No pics of the bixie because I hated it that much. I enjoy reading others' hair journeys, so here's my routine and my story. Hopefully it helps someone else out too. I used ChatGPT to help format my routine and hair history for an organized snapshot: **🧼 My Routine** * **Washing** I'm team **daily wash**—otherwise I get major scalp oiliness, flakes, smell, and breakouts. I alternate: * **L'Oréal EverPure Clarifying Shampoo + Restoring Conditioner** * **L'Oréal EverPure Hyaluron Plump Shampoo + Redken All Soft Conditioner** * **Amika The Kure Mask** – used occasionally for repair * **Scalp Care (once a week)** 1. Oil with **Mielle Rosemary Mint Oil** in sections 2. Massage oil in with fingertips 3. Do **scalp gua sha** for circulation 4. Use a **bamboo bristle brush** for 5–10 minutes, focusing on stimulating the scalp 5. Wash the oil out with **2 rounds of clarifying shampoo**, then condition based on how my hair feels * **After washing** * I apply **Kérastase Elixir Ultime Oil** on damp (microfiber towel-dried) hair * Reapply to dry ends as needed for softness & shine * I used to **blow-dry the scalp** lightly after washing to prevent wet flakes but do this less now **✂️ My Hair Journey (Life context + Cut regret)** * In 2024, my dad passed away from brain cancer. After he died, I had a grief spiral and did a drastic **DIY chop and color**. * It wasn't terrible, but I wanted something more refined. I found a stylist known for **short razor cuts** and asked for a bixie… * …but what I got was very “**toy soldier**” / **mushroom cap** vibes. The cut didn't allow for the style I brought in—despite handing over a literal **printed mood board**. * It was devastating. That was **August 2024**. * I've been growing it out ever since, now **July 2025**. * I did a **small self-trim between May and June** and it helped SO much with shape and confidence. * I'm also growing out my **natural color** now. **💡Current Focus** * Looking for **heatless styling** tips for short-to-medium length hair * Loving the **Sleepy Tie** for volume—though my hair isn't quite long enough to fully stay secured in it overnight * Would love to hear what others recommend for shape + volume at this awkward stage"

Already over 60 nations have decided on total boycott of Israel and the number is growing. What can you do as an individual member of the public do to help stop the genocide in Gaza AIPAC's sole agenda to wipe out Palestine and Iran. Also note that some products of Johnson's, Maggie, Nestle have been linked with serious side effects such as cancer. It may also help if you also boycotted nations that support Israel. Such as US, UK, German products, services and companies too. Cars such as Mercedes Benz, BMW, Audi, Porsche, Ford, Rolls Royce, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Mondeo, Mustang, EcoSport. With this the being tip of the iceberg of buying and controlling power. McDonalds and Burger King are also responsible for vast tracts of the Amazon rainforest being decimated beef production and converted into desert. Last year the Amazon experienced its first drought on record. Even the US govt would be hard put not cater to Israel's needs including veto power at the UNSC. Same applies to UK and Germany among other supporting nations of Israel. As Israel is not alone in committing genocide in Gaza. The driving force is behind Netanyahu is AIPAC. The more boycotting occurs, the better, and the faster Israel's ability to fund the war dries up. We can also pray that his own people are desperate for him to step down. Act on it sooner than later. Ben Gvir has revealed Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has had a pacemaker, fitted last year. Thank you."

Amazon's annual Prime Day extravaganza is back, and this time, the so-called 'Black Friday in July' is bigger (and longer) than ever before. For 2025, the epic shopping event runs four days—double the usual two—kicking off Tuesday, July 8, and wrapping up Friday, July 11, at 11 p.m. PT. This means shoppers get 96 hours to snag the best deals across Amazon's virtual aisles. Prime members can expect thousands of markdowns on everything from big-ticket electronics and home upgrades to luxe beauty staples, with major names like LG, Dyson, NuFace, Levi's, Samsung, Peloton, Bissell, and more in the mix. This year also brings a shiny new shopping feature: “Today's Big Deals”—a daily, themed drop of limited-time offers from top brands like Samsung, Kiehl's, and Levi's, launching at midnight and available while supplies last. You do need to be an Amazon Prime member to partake in Prime Day 2025, but if you're not already signed up, Amazon offers a free 30-day trial, so you can score the deals without committing right away (otherwise, it's $14.99/month or $139/year).

The Best Overall Beauty Deals at Amazon Prime Day Amazon Prime Day at a Glance Best Skincare Deals at Amazon Prime Day Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Spf 50 (Was $38) While technically this is a facial sunscreen, it doubles as a makeup primer that can be used anytime, anywhere. Katherine J. Igoe, an MC contributing editor, says, ""It goes on smoothly and feels incredibly lightweight without any of the annoyances of most sunscreens."" Katherine J. Igoe tests Supergoop! Unseen Sunscren SPF 50.

CeraVe Cerave Hydrating Cream to Foam Cleanser (Was $20) This cleanser is just what your skincare routine needs as a first step—it gently removes makeup and grime without drying out your skin.

It uses avocado oil and caffeine to help smooth puffy eyes and fine lines and to boost radiance.

We know the truth: Some things are just easier to order on Amazon. Quick deliveries, low or no shipping costs, and easy returns make it a convenient emporium. While most don't exactly think of the site as a destination to source high-quality or pretty products, there are a few elevated household and personal-care items our team buys over and over. From a fancy hotel candle to refillable German wood dish brushes, many of these must-haves would just as likely be found at a cute boutique. We tapped our editors and rounded up all our favorites, below. Kristen Flanagan, contributing editor Amazon Grown Alchemist Hydra-Restore Cream Facial Cleanser $50 $40 Shop Now A facialist used this creamy cleanser on me during a treatment, and I've been hooked ever since. It's light, yet moisturizing which is amazing for my sensitive but dry skin. Plus, it smells incredible—so fresh and citrusy. I feel like I'm being transported to a spa for the fleeting few minutes I spend on my morning and evening skincare. Amazon Aglary 20 Minute Meditation Beeswax Candles $15 $13 Shop Now I'm not big on meditation, but someone recommended I try these candles that burn for 20 minutes as a way to get into it. While I can't say I'm any more zen, I have taken to using them for motivation when there's a small task that I need to get done that I'm procrastinating. If there's a particularly difficult article I need to write, I light a candle and spend 20 minutes getting started. Sometimes that's all it takes to get in the zone. The same goes for organizing my office or cleaning up the house before I head to bed. It makes mundane moments feel more like rituals. Samantha Weiss-Hills, managing editor Amazon Debbie Meyer GreenBags, 40-Pack $20 Shop Now I added these produce bags to cart ASAP after my CSA recommended them to extend the life of our weekly delivery of fruits and vegetables. They're reusable several times over with just a quick wash, and keeps cucumbers, blueberries, and all kinds of greens fresh longer. And don't just take my word for it: nearly 27,000 reviewers have given them a 5-star review. Amazon Marvis Classic Strong Mint Toothpaste $11 Shop Now Marvis is the only toothpaste brand I've used for years, and my dentist tells me my teeth are very clean. I love that the distinct design makes it nice to look at on our open shelves and it can stand upright on its shapely cap. But it can be hard to find except in specialty stores, so Amazon is the most reliable place to order it. Amazon Hyoola 9-Inch Beeswax Taper Candles, 12-Pack $30 Shop Now For dinner parties, I love to serve meals by candlelight. That means I tend to burn through tapers quickly. I prefer beeswax, not only for the natural color but also because they don't drip and are unscented. These make sure I'm always stocked for the next time people come over...."

n2ay0ul,2025-07-10 03:49:41,en,REDDIT,"  It looks like frizz to me. Do you sleep with your hair braided? A satin bonnet or silk pillow case may be very beneficial. It looks like you have a fine hair and a leave in would be quite beneficial at the very minimum. If you are looking for a drugstore leave in - I recommend the Pantene 10 in 1 spray or the L'Oréal 21 in 1 spray. I've also had incredible results pairing the leave ins the with Tressemme A list smoothing cream (a little goes a long way). I think your shampoo / conditioner mask routine is fine tbh. What products do you use? You could consider skip conditioner altogether and just use a mask in its place but it would have to be a lightweight mask like the Dove serum mask, Pantene Miracle Deep Repair Conditioner or the Elizavecca one on Amazon. You could also try incorporating some targeted treatments like the L'Oréal wonder waters (in place of conditioner) or L'Oréal glycolic gloss (post conditioner) or Amika's smooth over 1 min treatment- they really help smooth down frizz. Ultimately it will be a combination of a good conditioning routing and post shower products and protective styles while sleeping that can help calm this down."

Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask This cult favorite leave-on lip mask by Laneige is a favorite among Forbes Vetted editors for delivering deep hydration and antioxidants as you sleep. “I keep the Laneige mask on my nightstand and slather it on before bed,” says special projects editor Jennifer Ferrise. ""I'm always amazed at how much softer my lips are every morning thanks to the mask's moisturizing ingredients like shea butter and murumuru seed. Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've seen for this lip sleeping mask all year. Limited Edition Dyson Airwrap i.d. Multi-Styler And Dryer Straight+Wavy After testing multiple hair tools for several months, features and special projects director Kim Peiffer named the Dyson Airwrap the best luxury blow dryer brush. “I've had this multi-styling tool for over a year now, and have seen firsthand all that it does—from smoothing strands to adding volume to creating perfect curls that mimic a professional in-salon blowout,” says Peiffer. During Prime Day, you can score the limited edition model in the color Jasper Plum for $100 less than the typical retail price. Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've seen for this model of the Dyson Airwrap all year. Solawave 4-In-1 Red Light Therapy Facial Wand This portable red light therapy wand targets fine lines and wrinkles, and helps with skin elasticity and firmness. With just three-minute daily sessions per area, regular users should notice improvements after several weeks. “I've had the Solawave Wand for over a year,” says special projects editor Jennifer Ferrise. “When I use it consistently, I notice that my skin tone is more even and the texture is smoother. It also helps reduce facial puffiness after a late night.” Why It's A Good Deal: This is the second-lowest price we've seen for the Solawave wand this year. Living Proof Perfect Hair Day Dry Shampoo Several members of the Forbes Vetted team have tried and loved this formula from Living Proof—so much so, it earned the title of best dry shampoo as a part of the 2024 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards. “This is the holy grail of dry shampoos,” says one tester, who has used it regularly for years. “It's consistently lightweight and volumizing, without leaving behind a chalky feel.” Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've seen for this dry shampoo all year. Nood Flasher 2.0 Kit Just in time for swimsuit season, the Nood Flasher 2.0 makes at-home laser hair removal easy. It's our top pick for coarse hair on our list of the best laser hair removal devices. “The Flasher 2.0 has a thoughtful, compact design that fits nicely in the hand, and it's lightweight enough that lengthier IPL sessions don't feel like a chore,” says one of our testers. Get it bundled with an exfoliating cleanser and soothing aloe treatment for 24% off. Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've ever seen for this laser hair removal device on Amazon.

Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask This cult favorite leave-on lip mask by Laneige is a favorite among Forbes Vetted editors for delivering deep hydration and antioxidants as you sleep. “I keep the Laneige mask on my nightstand and slather it on before bed,” says special projects editor Jennifer Ferrise. ""I'm always amazed at how much softer my lips are every morning thanks to the mask's moisturizing ingredients like shea butter and murumuru seed. Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've seen for this lip sleeping mask all year. Limited Edition Dyson Airwrap i.d. Multi-Styler And Dryer Straight+Wavy After testing multiple hair tools for several months, features and special projects director Kim Peiffer named the Dyson Airwrap the best luxury blow dryer brush. “I've had this multi-styling tool for over a year now, and have seen firsthand all that it does—from smoothing strands to adding volume to creating perfect curls that mimic a professional in-salon blowout,” says Peiffer. During Prime Day, you can score the limited edition model in the color Jasper Plum for $100 less than the typical retail price. Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've seen for this model of the Dyson Airwrap all year. Solawave 4-In-1 Red Light Therapy Facial Wand This portable red light therapy wand targets fine lines and wrinkles, and helps with skin elasticity and firmness. With just three-minute daily sessions per area, regular users should notice improvements after several weeks. “I've had the Solawave Wand for over a year,” says special projects editor Jennifer Ferrise. “When I use it consistently, I notice that my skin tone is more even and the texture is smoother. It also helps reduce facial puffiness after a late night.” Why It's A Good Deal: This is the second-lowest price we've seen for the Solawave wand this year. Living Proof Perfect Hair Day Dry Shampoo Several members of the Forbes Vetted team have tried and loved this formula from Living Proof—so much so, it earned the title of best dry shampoo as a part of the 2024 Forbes Vetted Best Product Awards. “This is the holy grail of dry shampoos,” says one tester, who has used it regularly for years. “It's consistently lightweight and volumizing, without leaving behind a chalky feel.” Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've seen for this dry shampoo all year. Nood Flasher 2.0 Kit Just in time for swimsuit season, the Nood Flasher 2.0 makes at-home laser hair removal easy. It's our top pick for coarse hair on our list of the best laser hair removal devices. “The Flasher 2.0 has a thoughtful, compact design that fits nicely in the hand, and it's lightweight enough that lengthier IPL sessions don't feel like a chore,” says one of our testers. Get it bundled with an exfoliating cleanser and soothing aloe treatment for 24% off. Why It's A Good Deal: This is the lowest price we've ever seen for this laser hair removal device on Amazon.

1lyg6t1,2025-07-13 01:06:14,en,REDDIT,"  Hi! I've never posted before and I'm usually a silent Reddit browser, but I'd love to join this community for encouragement and knowledge sharing. My current routine is as follows: Shampoo & Conditioner - Amika Velveteen Dream Hair Mask - Dove Bond Strength Leave-In - OGX Locking Coconut Curl Cream Gel - Not Your Mother's Curl Talk Flash Freeze Hover & pixie diffuse with hairdryer Oil - OGX Moroccan (to scrunch out the crunch) I've worn my natural curls a handful of times the last 5 years but have a hard time following through with it. I haven't heat styled my hair in almost 2 weeks and would love to continue wearing my curls. I'm just so used to seeing a very consistent look with a flat iron that it's hard to get used to a more unpredictable look. My curl pattern is inconsistent (tight and bouncy in the front and wavier in the back) which is probably due to perpetual heat styling. I plan to try a variety of products to see what work best. I think my hair is medium density and medium porosity, and it can get weighed down pretty easily. In the first photo, I think I used too much product because my hair lacks in volume compared to the photo in the black shirt. Long story short, I want to introduce myself and join a community for encouragement so I can embrace my truest self! Has anyone else had a similar experience of giving up on their natural hair and falling back into damaging hair routines? How did you stick with it through the adjustment phase? Thank you"
