Bath and body works because they're cheap mists and easy to try out. The products can be hit or miss, but they offer so much that it's too easy to collect."

""Rin was the one that said I can go high and spin around a lot. You have to do 40 bunny hops before I get done giving Dilila a bath,"" Cane snarls in annoyance. ""Awe, Papa Cane really embracing his role,"" Rin coos, ignoring Cane's orders, Jason barking in laughter, hugging his sides. Cane's face burns a brighter red and huffs, picking Dilila up and heads down below to the showers, grumbling as Rin and Jason laugh more. ""{Papa, can I do that too some day?}"" Dilila asks excitedly. ""{Maybe when you're older. You're too small to do it now, for now, let's get you cleaned up}"" Cane sighs out, grabbing some towels and heads to the shower. ""{Papa, papa, can we take a bath with bubbles?}"" Dilila asks pleadingly. ""{A bubble bath? I don't think we........}"" Cane starts to say but then hesitates when Dilila pouts at him with teary eyes. Cane groans and sighs, turning his walk to the tub. ""{I'll see if we have anything...... .}"" Dilila squeals in delight and bounces in his arm before he sets her down, setting the towels on the bench. Cane starts searching through all the cabinets to find anything that'll work before finding a basic soap solution that was unscented. Next to the bottle was a few essential oils and some Epsom salt. Probably the Aphrodite kids influence. He was also grateful to find a brush and some hair bands. Pulling everything out, he sets it all out next to the tub, turning to Dilila who was looking uo at him expectantly. ""{Hey, which one do you like better?}"" Cane asks, holding out the essential oils for her to smell. She walks over and sniffs each one, grinning wide at the last one. ""{I like this one papa}"" Dilila grins wider and bounces. Cane looks at it and couldn't stop his blush as he saw honeysuckle blossom. Shaking his head, Cane starts the water and throws in the soap, a few drops of oil and the salt, figuring it'll help ease his body while he helps clean her up. After prepping the tub, he helps Dilila undress and carries her over to the tub and slides her into the water. ""{Papa, you said you would bathe with me......}"" Dilila reminds, pouting at him. ""{I know, I will. I just........}"" Cane hesitates, not sure what he should do. Sighing heavily at her puppy eyes, he finally takes off his pants but leaves on his boxers, too embarrassed to be naked in front of a little girl. After clearing his head of his concerns, he climbs into the tub with her, sitting carefully as far away from her as he could but his efforts were in vain cause she sat on his lap, giggling at him. Deciding to treat this like a mission, he floats some water up and gently starts getting her hair wet, working to clean it. ""{Papa, um, do you think Dilila is cute?}"" Dilila asks, looking up at Cane curiously. ""{You...... . you're very cute. Why do you want to know?}"" Cane asks softly as he works some knots out of her hair. ""{Some people were mean to me and said I was ugly}"" Dilila explains sadly. ""{Well, those people were just jealous of how cute you are. They just didn't like cute things. Ignore those people, Dilila. They aren't good people to be mean to little kids like you}"" Cane reassures as he rinses her hair, glad to see she already looks cleaner...."

1lca0vr,2025-06-15 20:21:31,en,REDDIT,"  Every week, a quiet but powerful reshuffling happens across boardrooms and C-suites—and unless you're paying close attention, it's easy to miss what these moves signal. In the May 21st issue of DirectorMoves, dozens of new directors were appointed, CEOs were named and seasoned executives stepped down. For the most, these might seem like ordinary leadership changes, but at Chilmark Advisors, where we specialize in helping executives access the hidden market of board and leadership opportunities, these updates offer more than surface-level news, they reveal deeper trends shaping the leadership landscape. One trend is clear, companies are actively rethinking who gets a seat at the table and why. Take Capital One, for example. As part of its acquisition of Discover Financial, it appointed Jennifer Wong, Thomas Maheras, and Michael Shepherd to its board. Wong, the current COO of Reddit, represents the rising demand for digital fluency and operational savvy in legacy financial institutions. Similarly, Bath & Body Works just brought on Dan Heaf, a former Nike strategist, as CEO and director—an unmistakable signal that transformation experience is no longer optional, it's foundational. Behind each appointment is a strategic calculation. These companies aren't just filling vacancies, they're shaping the future of their leadership to meet the moment. But here's where it gets interesting: many of these board seats weren't filled through public searches or high-profile listings. Instead, they likely emerged through networks, targeted outreach and direct introductions, the very heart of the hidden market that our team has built, to help clients access. While companies reshuffle, the numbers still tell a sobering story. Since January, 77 women have exited board seats compared to 137 men. But among boards of companies, with over $5B in market cap, women have only gained two net new seats. That gap isn't just about representation—it's about opportunity pipelines that remain too narrow and often too opaque. At Chilmark Advisors, we use what we call the reverse search philosophy: instead of waiting for roles to be posted, we help candidates identify the decision-makers, most aligned with their skills, craft targeted outreach and build momentum through direct follow-ups. The traditional job market isn't where leadership roles are decided. That happens through relationships, timing and visibility. Leadership transitions, like those in DirectorMoves, remind us that the right time to raise your hand isn't when a job is posted, it's well before that, when priorities are shifting and possibilities are quietly opening. If you're an executive or aspiring board member looking to understand or access this space, our message is simple: you don't have to wait for the right door to open. Sometimes, you just need to knock on the right one. If you would like to know more about obtaining a board seat let us know [Chilmark Advisors](https://www.chilmarkadvisors.com/)"
mov_AA5971C0D9AA6BAA9D7A2840B5D6DB3E,2025-06-16 01:35:32,en,WEB,"  By Abigail Summerville NEW YORK (Reuters) -Activist investor Barington Capital Group plans to mount a push to change Victoria's Secret's board of directors and end a recently adopted shareholder's rights plan, according to a person familiar with the situation. The New York-based hedge fund, which owns more than 1% of the company, believes Victoria's Secret has underperformed its competitors and lost value since its spin-off from former parent company L Brands in 2021, the person said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Amid waning demand for its intimate apparel, Victoria's Secret shares have dropped by about 55% this year, and its current market value is about $1.45 billion. The Wall Street Journal reported Barington's plans earlier on Sunday. A Victoria's Secret spokesperson said that Barington has not contacted the company, but it looks forward to ""discussing their views with them."" ""We are confident that executing our strategy under the new and experienced leadership team will continue to unlock value for our shareholders,"" the spokesperson said. Barington wants the company to replace most or all of its board and end the ""poison pill"" plan that it adopted in May to protect it from hostile takeovers. It also believes the retailer should focus on core brands and initiatives, like bras and the Angels campaign, and accelerate growth in digital and international markets, the source said. Barington believes the company's Chief Executive Hillary Super, who took over in September 2024, has limited public company experience, and that the rest of the board lacks the necessary experience to revitalize the iconic brand, the person said. Super was previously the CEO of intimates brand Savage X Fenty. The fund also sees value in the Victoria's Secret beauty business, which it believes could be worth as much as the company's market value. Victoria's Secret adopted the poison pill plan to fend off investment firm BBRC International Private Limited, which increased its stake in the company to around 13%. Barington is also an investor in Macy's and Hanesbrands. Founded by James Mitarotonda, Barington previously pushed for changes at L Brands, which split into Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. At Macy's, the firm wanted the department store to create a real estate unit and cut costs to boost the share price. Earlier this year, Barington mounted its first full-blown board room challenge since 2015 when it tried to put three directors on the board of casket maker Matthews International but ended up losing the vote.

The New York-based hedge fund, which owns more than 1% of the company, said Victoria's Secret has underperformed its competitors and lost over $2.4 billion in shareholder value since its spin-off in 2021 from former parent company L Brands. On Sunday, Reuters reported, citing sources, that Barington wants the company to replace most or all of its board and end the ""poison pill"" plan that it adopted in May to protect the company from hostile takeovers. Victoria's Secret shares, which have lost more than half of their value so far this year amid waning demand, were up about 3% in premarket trading. Victoria's Secret requires a reconstituted board comprising directors with ""proven experience in brand revitalization, operational execution, international expansion, and shareholder value creation,"" James Mitarotonda, Barington's founder and CEO, said in the letter. The investment firm said the retailer should focus on core categories and initiatives, like bras and the Angels campaign, and accelerate growth in digital and international markets. Barington highlighted concerns about the company's leadership, and said Chief Executive Hillary Super, who took over in September 2024, has limited public company experience, and that the rest of the board lacks the necessary experience to revitalize the iconic brand.

mov_F5E9C261A20374AF140AB6390CCDEFD5,2025-06-16 21:04:42,en,WEB,"  A man found out he was married after police say his ex-girlfriend filed a marriage certificate without his knowledge after they broke up. The 42-year-old man contacted Beverly Hills Police Friday to report he had found a Bath & Body Works gift bag from his ex-girlfriend, Kristin Marie Spearman, a 36-year-old from Waco, at his home, authorities said in a press release. Police say the package contained a picture of Spearman holding a marriage license showing she and the man were married. There was also a copy of a marriage certificate which was filed with the county clerk's office in the gift bag, according to authorities. The man told police he was in a relationship with Spearman and they obtained marriage licenses earlier this month ahead of their planned wedding.

The rather abrupt arrival of winter in Sydney this year, brought on by a polar air mass from the south, has forced us to embrace the cold – whether we like it or not. But rather than hiding indoors, Q Station in Manly is luring Sydneysiders outside with a special pop-up sauna experience to celebrate the upcoming winter solstice. Q Station in Manly is embracing the winter solstice. (Image: Destination NSW) What is the winter solstice? The winter solstice signifies the shortest day of the year. In Australia, it occurs when the southern hemisphere is tilted furthest from the sun on the Earth's axis, resulting in the least amount of daylight hours. This year, the winter solstice falls on 21 June. For lovers of winter, it's the perfect excuse to revel in the season's magic; crisp air, cosy activities and cool nights. Prefer summer? The day also marks the start of Earth's slow rotation back towards the light (and warmth). So no matter what weather you prefer, there's cause for celebration. How is Q Station celebrating? Q Station in Manly is inviting you to make the most of the shortest day of the year with its Winter Solstice celebrations. It's all relaxation and rejuvenation, with everything from yoga sessions and ice baths to dinner buffets and glögg (Nordic mulled wine) to soothe those winter blues. But the day's main drawcard is a luxurious pop-up sauna, courtesy of Cedar & Salt. Perched on the wharf, it's the perfect place for a bit of R&R. Watch ferries pass by on Sydney Harbour as you cleanse your body, mind and soul in the Finnish steam room on wheels. Sydney-based Cedar & Salt specialises in portable Finnish saunas. The rise of wellness travel has seen self-care-based experiences pop up across the country, from Tasmania's swoon-worthy sauna trail to hotels dedicated to healing. But for some, finding the time (and money) to book them is a different story. Q Station's pop-up sauna is a happy medium – an indulgent wellness experience just a stone's throw from Sydney's CBD, with prices starting at just $45 per person. But that's not all. After sweating it out in the sauna, nourish your body with lunch at onsite restaurant, Boilerhouse. Or join a yoga class backed by a live DJ set. Maybe you'd rather a soothing sound healing session? Or brave an ice bath before warming up with a Scandinavian buffet. Q Station is squeezing it all into just one day – the shortest of the year, at that! Treat yourself to a sauna experience this winter solstice. While many time slots on 21 June have already been booked, there are still a handful available at midday, 1 pm and 3 pm. If you miss out, fear not. Q Station will be running sauna sessions until the end of August. To maximise accessibility, sauna experiences are communal, but group reservations can be booked. What else is on this winter? Don't confine your seasonal celebrations to a single day – Q Station certainly isn't! The party continues at Rise Manly, the Sydney venue's very own winter festival. Unfolding across 10 days from 20–29 June, guests can enjoy history tours, dining experiences, guided nature walks and, of course, sauna sessions. Not in Sydney? No stress! There are plenty of exciting winter festivals happening all over the country, so nobody has to miss out. Taylah Darnell is Australian Traveller Media's Writer & Producer.

Promising review: ""Took this on my first cruise. Anytime that I started to feel woozy I'd reach for it.

I would be itching so bad but once I placed one on the bite, it reduced the itching to almost nonexistent. The pack comes with different sizes. It's helped with not scarring my legs from the bites. I'll definitely rebuy this for summer. It's so easy and great to just throw in your bag."" —Holly C. Get a pack of 36 from Amazon for $9.99. 4.

78b39675021591832cf90a00210eeaa8,2025-06-17 12:29:00,en,WEB,"  I'm no fashion guru, but follow along if you're so inclined. Issue #1 of I Was A Fashion School Serial Killer was a sketch of, say, a pantsuit — the idea is there (Rennie enrolls in fashion school while managing her homicidal inclinations) even if things were still clearly coalescing. Issue #2, then, saw the design develop a little further, and we begin to better experience the deeply human story as unfurled by creators Doug Wagner and Daniel Hillyard. Issue #3, however, is when we start putting the suit together but then we also stab ourselves a dozen times with the shears. Which is to actually say, after dispatching those frat bros in issue #2, Rennie has hit a true stride in this latest issue. She's basically stopped killing, and even obsessively scratching at her arms/body. And while she doesn't land a prestigious internship, she is given the direction and support to follow her dreams. It's all like that moment in The Devil Wears Prada where Andy finally hits her groove in the cutthroat world of high fashion. (But with more murder, obvi.) But all good come-ups need their requisite come-down, and for Rennie in issue #3, it's the little things. There's trouble with her BFF Sofie's, um, wandering boyfriend; more trouble with Sofie potentially having to leave fashion school; and even more beef with the school's resident mean girl, Constance. It's enough to make a girl want to stab somebody in the forehead, amirite?! I love the choice of “triggers” here — they're mostly external and not of anything to do with Rennie per se. It's this idea that, as she hits her stride personally and creatively, it's her friends that struggle, and that reminds her of the tenuousness of her own happiness and how it relies on so much of the outside world. And that's a really interesting and essential idea: It reminds Rennie of her powerlessness, and try as she may to make friends and develop as a person, things can still go wrong and there's nothing she can do about it. (Well, nothing that doesn't involve breaking bad and going back to slaying, of course.) It feels like a solid decision by Wagner and Hillyard to test their lead in a way that feels especially effective and perhaps something we can grapple with to some degree or another. And this path is supported by even more strategic art choices (which includes the efforts of colorist Michelle Madsen). Rennie's need to itch becomes this repeating visual device to track her status, and as it intensifies across the issue, we can feel her mood start to slowly but solidly swing. They also use the appearance of a odd bear necklace/charm to explore Rennie's mood, as it too gets ever closer to being out outside her shirt once again, you can once more feel the mood twist in a really visceral manner. Even a slight wardrobe change for Rennie toward more colorful patterns means a lot — when it all starts going wrong, the return of long sleeves and plaid is among the most horrific sights in any horror property. I certainly loved the endless blood of issue #2, but pulling back in this issue made everything more cerebral, and that direction is vital if this book can prove to be deeply effective and not just gore for the mere sake of it. Really, that level of subtlety works optimal for I Was A Fashion School Serial Killer. To yet again reference older Wagner-Hillyard tales, Plastic was a veritable blood bath, and while this book could easily beat that by the metric ton, the fact that it isn't feels really important. It's an energy and sense of purpose that takes what could be a slightly slower, less packed issue (packed in terms of not large events but rather world-building and character work) and makes it feel packed with significance. In fact, there's only one proper hint about the possibilities for issue #4, but it's executed with a violence and intensity that feels utterly disarming. And it's also similarly packed with nuance and subtle-but-important visual cues that feel in line with this issue's tempo, and that's quite important for fully cementing the true value of this third chapter. Sure, you may have guessed even before the end of issue #3 who at the fashion school is next on Rennie's chopping block. However, even if that feels obvious — and also something we've all been salivating over since the debut — there's no telling if it'll happen. Or, if it'll actually mean anything for Rennie emotionally. Because as the creators made clear in this latest issue, the story of I Was A Fashion School Serial Killer isn't just another character study of a psycho. There's some real care and attention shown to Rennie, and the creators want to push this girl to see if she can handle the pressure in a way that's productive at all. It's a story that goes beyond some of their other efforts to feel more robust, confrontational, and generally about humanity's ability to overcome its worst tendencies. (Or, conversely, if all we can ever truly amount to are said tendencies.) Ultimately, I don't know what will happen in issue #4 of I Was A Fashion School Serial Killer (which is the penultimate issue, FYI). I do know, however, that whatever direction this story goes, we can expect more emotionally-charged social dissections, a bit of blood and gore (OK, plenty of both), and a story with real charm and stakes. Even if this were a pantsuit made of barbed wire, I'd totes rock this lil' number."

The analyst based the rating on the company's potential for future growth following its fiscal Q1 2025 earnings report. Straton exited the Q1 report with “a more negative tilt to our Overweight rating,” stating that there are several reasons behind the negative stock reaction after earnings. These include lesser-than-expected insulation from tariffs, the Q2 guidance suggesting a quarter-over-quarter sales deceleration, and a “noisier” reiteration of fiscal year guidance.

If a villain doesn't give their backstory, they can make a good guess at it based on what they did. But it's for *everything* so it's easy to lose the trees in the forest. Doughboy: any blunt contact beyond a threshold results in its damage being converted into a tickling sensation and giggling like the Pillsbury Doughboy. A punch to the face makes them chuckle and they're undamaged. But the harder the hit the more they laugh and eventually the laughter is debilitating. Van Gogh Hair: they have full control of the color and pattern of their hair. Paisley? Yup. Plaid? Sure. Starry Night? You betcha! Oscar the Grouch's Bowling Shirt? Why not! With some effort they can even animate on their hair. Overuse makes them go literally pale, losing all their color, and they get a headache after too long overusing it. Gemstone: they turn into a gemstone. Any gemstone. But unlike Harden they're completely immobile. Frozen, but still conscious. If broken and de-gemmed they're unwounded, as if she has Lizard Tail Splitter. They can be repaired by putting their pieces back together in gem form, in a bath of water with the same gem's molecular components dissolved in it. Lost pieces are also regrown but at a slow rate. A lost pinkie takes a solid month with a bag of mineral water strapped to an unmoving hand. All Accents: they have all of the accents. Every one. From living languages, dead languages, even languages that have gone undiscovered. Also works with sign language. Useful for audiobooks and sometimes figuring out old, half-translated languages and doing every voice when recording audiobooks. User helped translate the Linear A script by yammering on in the accent until linguists figured out how it worked by comparing how foreign accents affect different languages. Absolute Proprioception: they have perfect understanding of their body and its position both internally and externally. They can even map spaces by knowing where their body has gone, like a maze where you have erased the maze but still have the completed path. Average Above Average: they have above average skills, but only skills that are average to have. The range where their average is drawn from is typically thirty miles, but with effort they can narrow it down for a short period. With focus they can be an above average member of I-Island, but that would include all the support staff and worker's families. Osmosis Thinking: they can literally learn by osmosis, sucking the knowledge out of objects and people. Resulting in illegible books and temporarily dumbed down people. But if they try it on someone less intelligent than they are, they loose knowledge to the other person. Because osmosis works both ways. It's temporary on other people though. Also effected by substances that reduce thinking capacity like alcohol and drugs. Though it's tough to balance doses high enough to dumb them down enough to work, but won't affect them longer than the info dump lasts. Others who gain info find it easier to regain it after the effect ends, though, since by then it's more like remembering than learning."

Background: McClennan County Jail (Google Maps). A 36-year-old woman in  Texas has been arrested after she legally married her ex-boyfriend - a feat she allegedly pulled off without the 42-year-old man knowing about it. Kristin Marie Spearman was taken into custody and charged with one count of third-degree felony  stalking in the bizarre case, authorities announced. According to a news release from the Beverly Hills, Texas, Police Department, the investigation into Spearman began on June 13, 2025, when the ex-boyfriend contacted the department and relayed an outlandish set of claims. The man said he had been out of his house all day and returned that evening to find 'a package from his ex-girlfriend sitting on the property.' He identified the ex-girlfriend as Spearman. The package was a 'gift bag from Bath & Body Works' that contained multiple products from the establishment. But that was not all. Police said the package also included two documents that were particularly shocking. 'One was a picture of his ex-girlfriend and arrestee, 36-year-old Kristin Marie Spearman of Waco, holding what appears to be a marriage license showing them married and officiated by a local reverend,' the release states. ' Along with this document is another, which was a copy of the marriage certificate filed with the county clerk's office.' Love true crime?

The ex-boyfriend told police that he and Spearman had been in a relationship and they had decided to obtain marriage licenses. However, he said that after filling out the application and being issued the license, they couple had 'gotten into an argument' that ended with the ex-boyfriend telling Spearman that 'he did not want to be in a relationship.' 'It was found during a follow-up investigation with the reverend that Kristin Spearman pursuant to the scheme of obtaining a marriage certificate, convinced the reverend to certify the victim and Kristin in the Holy Union of Matrimony without the knowledge of the victim and his required presence,' police wrote in the release. Next, while 'acting within the same scheme of conduct,' authorities said Spearman took the license to the county clerk's office and formally filed the 'certificate of official marriage.' After filing with the county clerk, Spearman allegedly compiled the gift bag, wrote multiple notes on it, and included the image of herself and the certified copy of the marriage certificate before leaving it on her ex-boyfriend's property. Police noted that they were not releasing any information about the reverend who officiated the one-sided marriage ceremony to 'prevent harassment and influence' as the investigation continues. Beverly Hills Chief of Police Kory Martin  told Waco Fox affiliate KWKT that the case was a first for him in more than two decades of law enforcement experience. 'I don't think in 23 years I've never heard of anybody who managed somehow to get married to someone who wasn't present for a ceremony,' he told the station. ' I've talked to the victim and he's going through a significant process to try to fix this at this point, so that's a whole [different] situation.' Spearman was located at her residence and transported to the McLennan County Jail for processing. Jail records indicate she has since been released from custody.

A 42-year-old Texas man discovered he was married to his ex-fiancée without his knowledge when the marriage certificate arrived at his home — just days after the pair broke up. Kristin Marie Spearman, 36, is accused of sending her ex a gift bag from Bath & Body Works that contained some “products” and a copy of an officiated marriage license with their names on June 13, according to Fox 44. Spearman allegedly also included a photo of herself holding up the document that legally recognized their relationship. The spooked victim, who is not being named by authorities, admitted that the pair was in a relationship around June 2 when they went to the county clerk's office to receive a marriage license. Explore More Both parties “must appear in person” and have valid identification to receive an application for a marriage license, according to McLennan County's website. Spearman and her ex-fiancé never made it to the altar. The pair got into an argument when the victim allegedly claimed he didn't want to be in a relationship with her anymore. Spearman seemingly had other plans for their future. Beverly Hills Police Chief Kory Martin claimed Spearman went behind the victim's back and convinced a pastor to certify a marriage, even though the man wasn't in attendance or even aware of a ceremony. “I don't think in 23 years I've ever heard of anybody who managed somehow to get married to someone who wasn't present for a ceremony,” Chief Martin told the outlet. After the reverend signed off on the fraudulent wedding, Spearman took a certified marriage license to her local county clerk's office and filed the certificate with officials, police said. The stunned victim learned about the marriage filing days after he dumped her, according to the outlet. “I've talked to the victim and he's going through a significant process to try to have to fix this,” Chief Martin added. “So that's a whole other situation is– not only you have the concern of 'What does that mean for my safety and my property?' You know, which is a huge conversation in this, but also, 'What do I have to do to fix it?'” Police arrested Spearman and charged her with third-degree felony stalking. She was booked into the McLennan County Jail.

Installation view at Spike Island. Image courtesy the artist. Photo: Rob Harris. Spike Island, Bristol 31 May – 7 September 2025 by DAVID TRIGG The three black monochrome canvases that open this exhibition are austere, aggressive and discomforting. Rows of sharp tacks protrude from their gridded surfaces, and one features a pair of carceral metal grilles. The Guyanese British artist Donald Locke (1930-2010) made these stark mixed-media works in the 1970s and, although they employ the language of geometric abstraction, they refer to the gridded topography of the Guyanese sugar plantations created by Dutch colonisers in the 16th century and later controlled by the British. In approximating aerial views of these sites, they point to landscapes that, to this day, are haunted by the scars of enslavement and indenture. Such melding of formal concerns with the dark histories of slavery and colonialism is characteristic of many works in this ambitious survey, which charts the development of Locke's expansive, interdisciplinary practice from the mid-60s to the late 00s. Donald Locke, Black Painting, 1978-79. Mixed media on canvas, formica, ceramic elements attached to canvas with stainless steel washers. Courtesy Estate of Donald Locke and Alison Jacques. Born and raised in British Guiana (independent Guyana since 1966), Locke attended the Working People's Art Class in Georgetown before receiving scholarships to study in the UK at Bath Academy of Art (1954-57) and Edinburgh College of Art (1959–64), where he became enamoured with ceramics. After relocating to Georgetown in 1964 to teach art at Queen's College, a research bursary allowed him to return to Edinburgh in 1969 to further develop his ceramic skills, after which he moved to London, where he lived from 1970 to 1978. The striking vessels and biomorphic volumes that Locke created during the 60s showcase his versatility and expressive freedom as a ceramicist. Shaking off the rigid limitations of mid-century British studio pottery, they are a celebration of clay, evoking the human body and organic forms. These sensual, tactile pieces paved the way for his radical Plantation Series (c1972-6), in which ceramic elements are combined with metal, wood, grass, carpet, fur, paint and lacquer to directly address themes of subjugation in colonial Guyana. With a practice increasingly unbounded by geography and the conventions of British art, this development flowed from Locke's diasporic identity. As he remarked in a 1976 interview, he was now working “without the old inhibitions which still operate with deadening effect in many of the studios in Britain”. Donald Locke: Resistant Forms, 2025. Installation view at Spike Island. Image courtesy the artist. Photo: Rob Harris. The small assemblages Plantation K-140 (1974) and Plantation Piece (1973) comprise black, rectangular bases topped with tight rows of slender ceramic forms. Alluding to human figures, these vertical protuberances are held by small metal cages, a reference to the devices designed to trap fruit-eating pests on Guyanese plantations but also suggestive of those used in the enslavement of people. Although they were initially presented as purely abstract sculptures, Locke would later concede that these works were metaphors for the coerced labour of the exploitative plantation system that shaped Guyana and other Caribbean nations. As he said in a 2007 interview, his use of formalist abstraction was a way of refracting his predominant interest in “the nature and experience of the black man in the New World”. Donald Locke: Resistant Forms, 2025. Installation view at Spike Island. Image courtesy the artist. Photo: Rob Harris. The most well-known work in the exhibition, Trophies of Empire (1972-74), is a large open shelving unit with 27 compartments, each housing one of Locke's infamous ceramic “bullets”. Some of these highly polished black cylinders appear like candles, while others resemble cucumbers, erect stamens (à la Robert Mapplethorpe) and, somewhat inevitably, phalluses. Indeed, critics have consistently read them as priapic forms. Rasheed Araeen, writing in the catalogue to the seminal exhibition The Other Story at the Hayward Gallery in 1989, suggested that Locke should “come out of the cocoon of his sexual fantasies and come to terms with the outside world”. However, the artist always maintained that these objects, which are mounted into trophy cups, candle holders, and other assorted vessels, were ammunition. Donald Locke: Resistant Forms, 2025. Installation view at Spike Island. Image courtesy the artist. Photo: Rob Harris. Such ambiguities typify Locke's works. A case in point are his mixed-media canvases of the 90s, made after a Guggenheim Fellowship brought him to the United States in 1979 (he first lived in Phoenix, Arizona, until 1990, and then Atlanta, Georgia, until his death). Their surfaces contain expanses of black paint applied with wild, gestural brushstrokes and overlaid with perplexing amalgamations of found objects and photographs. Pieces of wood, metal and fur collide with photographs and photocopied images of, among other things, Confederate and Union soldiers, the British royal family, weapons and Locke's own sculptures, including bronzes made in Arizona such as Pomona Blue (1985-86) – a voluptuous female figure without arms, feet or a head, inspired by the tragic story of the 19th-century enslaved woman Sarah Baartman. These works are as much about the artist's enjoyment of assembling disparate materials as they are commentaries on plantation violence, colonial injustices and the history of American racial politics. With them, Locke aligned himself with a lineage of 20th-century artists working with assemblage, from André Breton to Robert Rauschenberg, to black vernacular artists of the American south such as Thornton Dial and Lonnie Holley. In doing so, he ensured that they remained open to a multiplicity of readings...."

It makes sense. If your body is relaxed, your mind will follow. There's a lot you can do to relax at night—read a good book, meditate—but two that are particularly helpful, both physically and mentally, are a warm bath and stretching. Let's look at those and how to include them in your bedtime routine. Links in this post may be affiliate links.

Thank you for using my links. It all starts with the decision to get a better night's sleep. And you do it with a daily routine that includes getting into bed at the same time each day - including weekends. It also helps to get up roughly at the same time each morning. Sleeping in a little when you can is fine, but don't make it more than an hour or two so you can still fall asleep at the appropriate time. That might sound hard at first, but the more you stick to your routine, the easier it will become. After a few weeks, it will become a habit. You'll know you're close when you start to wake up a few minutes before your alarm. Going to bed and waking up at the same time daily are the cornerstones of your routine, but you don't want to stop there. What you do in the hour or so before bed can make a big difference in how easy it is to fall asleep and how soundly you'll sleep through the night. You can do a lot to set yourself up for a good night's rest. A warm bath, reading a book, leaving your phone in the living room …     Take a moment to sketch out your ideal nighttime routine. Keep it simple and start small. What are two or three things you can consistently do before you go to bed at night? This could be brushing your teeth and washing your face. It could also be lighting a candle and reading or journaling for a few minutes right before bed. Or how about sipping a cup of herbal tea? Write down your first take at a bedtime routine and try it out. How did it feel? What works for you, what does not? It's okay to make changes over time and tweak it as needed. The only rules are to stick to your bedtime and to eventually land on a routine you can stick with until it becomes an automatic habit. Once you've found your routine, stick to it for a few months. After that, you can make the occasional exception. You'll be surprised how much easier it will be to fall asleep with a good bedtime routine in place.

1lehgfk,2025-06-18 13:43:09,en,REDDIT,"  Hi all This is half rant, half seeking guidance on figuring out how to settle our 1 year old. Back Story- Our 1 year old has been going to Daycare for the past couple of months. When we started, he had terrible separation anxiety and would just cling to mom or dad once home. Any sleep was contact nap or while breastfeeding. Eventually, things started to shift, he would get clingy, but then would breastfeed, do a super long nap ( e.g. 6pm to 9pm) and then depending on the mood - play, dinner, bath, sleep. Now since past 1 week, things are just getting progressively worse once we go to bed. . he does a short 30 minutes nap once home from daycare, dinner, play/ bath and bed. But he is so difficult to put to sleep. If breastfeeding - he keeps latching & relatching every few seconds while crying loudly. If rocking - he gets hysterical, moves his body and tries to literally jump out of my arms. He wakes up every couple of hours at night and this repeats. Sometimes he starts crying and would roll around the bed or start walking while his eyes are still closed. Or scream like someone is hurting him. It's quite distressing. We've tried I'm giving him medicines for teething pains or gas. A lot of times he needs to burp, but when we try to burp, he fights us, try to jump down from our arms. Funny thing is,  when it's finally dawn, he goes into a deep peaceful sleep after 6am. We have to wake him up for daycare at 7:30. He is great at daycare - plays a lot, eats, takes one long nap after lunch. Even after daycare, he is such a sweet, loving, intelligent baby. Loves to play with us, loves to go out on walks... We are just clueless as to what is going on at night?! Husband works a very intense job and so these frequent wakings are impacting his work. We are exhausted, we are angry but we are also very concerned. Is something wrong? What can we do to make things better for our baby?"

The approximately 2,908-square-foot location, which opened Friday, showcases the retailer's latest store concept, Gingham+, Bath & Body Works said in a news release. As a part of the new experience, there is a more-open floor plan with dedicated zones for different product categories, wider aisles and increased shopping space, the company said. Select Gingham+ stores will feature scent bars where customers can sample candles, Wallflowers air fresheners and fragrance mists, while video displays will help introduce shoppers to new products and fragrances. The Gingham+ design represents Bath & Body Works' latest approach, which has already been implemented in more than 15 locations across South Korea, Los Angeles, Texas and other global markets. The company said it plans to incorporate this design into most of its new U.S. store openings throughout the year, hoping to appeal to Gen Z consumers who, according to research, prefer in-store shopping. Eduardo Tonietto, group vice president of store design, said in a statement that “we're constantly leveraging data and insights to create and refine a one-of-a-kind retail experience that truly sets us apart.” This story was written with the assistance of AI."

In a bizarre story, a 36-year woman from Texas has since been charged with stalking her former partner. Kristin Marie Spearman sent him a gift bag on Friday (June 13) from Bath & Body Works that also contained a officiated marriage licence with their names it. Spearman also allegedly also sent photo of herself holding up the document, which legally bound them in matrimony. Beverly Hills Police Chief Kory Martin expressed his amazement at the case, saying: ""I don't think in 23 years I've ever heard of anybody who managed somehow to get married to someone who wasn't present for a ceremony."" The victim, who has not been named by police, said that he had been in a relationship with Spearman, according to local news outlet Fox44. The pair received a marriage licence around June 2 but then broke up before the wedding after an argument. However, his ex-partner seemingly refused to take no for an answer and, armed with the licence, visited her pastor. She then somehow convinced him to certify it even though the groom wasn't present. Spearman then took the paper to her local county clerk's office and filed the certificate with officials, according to police. Chief Martin went on: “I've talked to the victim, and he's going through a significant process to try to have to fix this at this point.

""But also what I have to do to fix it, you know, and it's looking like the process is going to be quite lengthy.” Spearman was arrested at her home near Hewitt and charged her with third-degree felony stalking. She was booked into the McLennan County Jail. Chief Martin researched the rare scenario and looked through the county's family and marriage code, checking to see if even a proxy for the victim would have been acceptable at the ceremony.

1leqzuk,2025-06-18 20:00:22,en,REDDIT,"  title pretty much explains it. I have been going through this for a while now. eczema since birth, asthmatic so i have been on steroid creams a lot, especially after 2019/2020, and have had several severe asthma attacks where i've had to get a steroid shot and oral steroids. went on dupixent in early 2023, it went horribly. doctor was putting me on prednisone every 2 weeks to control full body flares and i think it just made them worse. after discontinuing dupixent my neck was still bothering me, worse than before dupixent. Tried going to many many derms and doctors, nobody believed it was fungal and nobody wanted to give me itraconazole or fluconazole because it is ""hard on the liver"" (i have a perfectly healthy liver). After months of decent skin minus my neck and managing flare spots with opzelura, it stopped working. went back to derm, got oral prednisone. got much much worse after this, i think this is where i started true TSW (November 2024). Chills, sweating, terrible sleep, all sorts of weird shit, and of course the redness, itching, peeling, etc etc. 3 bouts of eczema herpeticum. gave in and did a steroid shot in Jan 2025 during one of the herpeticum outbreaks. Was doing ok after that minus some oozing from my face that just wouldn't stop. Went back to a derm who put me on steroid cream again (i hadn't accepted that I was in TSW because I was scared to face reality), then had a severe asthma attack due to apartment mold and was told i *HAVE* to take prednisone for my lungs. after that pred course i was in full blown TSW. I have been managing since feb 2025 with a variety of things. I take a dead sea salt bath every day, sometimes with vinegar, or tea tree oil. i have moisturized with MCT oil, coconut oil, castor oil, la roche posay AP lipikar, and cerave healing ointment. they're all ok, nothing really works. I also tried Marin, that lobster cream from social media. i think I was too early on and in the proliferation stage so it didnt stand a chance. the lip balm works great though. I tried dupixent again but it gave me severe eye issues that I am still recovering from. I go to an infrared sauna at least once a week. I take daily supplements as follows: berberine super lysine/vit c pills omega complex NAC Oregano Oil Black Seed Oil for a while I was also taking taurine and some adrenal support complexes. I've also been taking [REDACTED], at gradually increasing doses, now at probably 40mg a day or so, sometimes more (i am 165lbs). Not sure if it is helping. Everything seems to get better and then worse. I have also tried dettol to kill bacteria on my skin. I have also tried antifungal powder to dry oozing areas and prevent infection from malassezia. I am definitely doing a lot better overall, but I am seeing my body shift from red and flaking to itchy and oozing, and I can't stand it. My skin keeps splitting open and immediately getting infected. My entire forearms and hands and neck and face are covered in little cuts with yellow crystals around them. My neck has probably seen the most use of steroid creams, opzelura, etc, along with my forearms. so naturally those areas, and to a lesser degree my face and scalp, are the ones still driving me insane, but the neck is the worst. I get overwhelmed with this itching sensation several times a day and end up just clawing at it like a crazy person, scouring away all the dead skin or growing skin and just leaving this oozing fucking mess. it stinks like copper or iron and hurts like hell. Often I cannot go outside without wrapping it in gauze, and I sleep every night with something around my neck and something on my pillow to limit the spread of ooze and miserable sensation of my neck wrinkles being wet and touching my shoulder and face. Lately my arms have been getting the same level of horrible itching and i've started clawing them apart late at night as well. i need to figure out something to stop the itch attacks, or I can tell that I am just never going to heal. my neck is so covered in these splits, its like every crease mark in my body is on the verge of splitting open and then when i scratch they crack open and start oozing and crusting. the skin is so damaged and I am not giving it a chance to heal, I can't give it a chance to heal, i cant stop. i am going insane...."

myjrp4v,2025-06-19 00:32:41,en,REDDIT,"  I'm using Cotton Candy Clouds from Bath & Body Works these days, but Lush Snow Fairy is a good option as well. The Cotton Candy mist from Body Fantasies smells more like a candy grape than cotton candy. Snow Fairy is like cotton candy and bubblegum, but I associate it with the smell of amoxicillin (long story short I was a pharmacy technician)."
mykjes0,2025-06-19 03:22:09,en,REDDIT,"  I do a few different things. I read Thich Nhat Hanh's “The Heart of the Buddha's Teaching” years ago and it impacted my practice a lot. - I do the classic “close your eyes and breathe” thing, but in my head most of the time I'll be saying “breathing in, I know that I am breathing in. Breathing out, I know that I am breathing out.” And I try to focus on really KNOWING that I'm breathing in or out in that moment. I usually can't do that for an entire session but it's a good way to get started and ground myself. - Sometimes if I'm having a hard time with racing thoughts while meditating I'll focus on the breath and my surroundings with my eyes open. The extra visual “input” can help quiet my thoughts. - I like meditation where I focus on the sounds I can hear around me. In my experience this works best during the day vs at night, when there are a few soft sounds rather than just one or silence. - Body scan meditation can work well for me. I find this one works best if I'm taking a bath, probably because there's the gentle sensation of the water around me already. Again, that little bit of physical grounding helps with racing thoughts and anxiety. - In his book, Thich Nhat Hanh described dealing with thoughts and emotions in a way that I think about nearly every day. He described encountering them as greeting a person who is suffering. So when my anxiety acts up, I picture it as a person, usually a scared child, and I imagine embracing it. Because it's not my enemy. It's a part of me that's afraid and needs care. So instead of resistance, I give empathy. And that really, really helps. - I also like box breathing, where you inhale, hold, exhale, hold. For the hold after the inhale, I try to sit in the feeling of anticipation, like being at the top of a roller coaster. And for the hold after the exhale, I try to enjoy a few seconds of pure rest. - Honestly, sometimes I just lay down, close my eyes, and let myself feel. No agenda, just taking some time to rest and allow myself to experience whatever I need to. I have burst into tears doing this. But it was something I needed to process, and I felt a lot more peaceful after. I would recommend having good techniques to handle any emotions that come up if you do this, though. Ultimately, what feels like it “works” one day might not work the next. Sometimes I'll meditate, feel like I just don't have whatever kind of meditation I'm attempting in my that day, and try a different technique. I do usually try to stick it out though. The consistency is the most important part. In my experience the effect of mediation is cumulative."

We spoke to one about how he makes it work and the challenge of getting a good nights' sleep email X WhatsApp Facebook link share Share bookmark Save email X WhatsApp Facebook link bookmark Jacob Ward is a baker at e5 Bakehouse in Hackney, east London. Established in 2010, e5 Bakehouse was London's first independent bakery to champion artisanal sourdough baking and heritage grain. e5 recently opened the third of their independently run and owned cafe-bakeries at the V&A East Storehouse in Hackney Wick. Jacob started baking at home during lockdown and has been working as a baker for over three years. “I've always really enjoyed making food, but the long hours and intense stress of kitchen hours was something I wanted to avoid. “Baking is a really lovely combination of making something with your hands – being very detail-oriented with recipes – and being very tactile and somatic. Bread, in particular, is something that you have to nurture and care for, so there's a holistic element as well. I'm very interested in that intercept of land and people, and how food acts as a glue that connects people to a place. I wanted to work somewhere that had an appreciation of this and E5 is very keen on this, so I felt very lucky when they started advertising for jobs. “When it comes to working hours, each bakery is different. Many start work at 4 or 5am and finish relatively early in the day. At e5 Bakehouse, we start work at 9am most days then take turns so one of us starts at 3am once a week to come in early to do the bake. So, it's very gentle until that one brutal day. “On my early-shift day, it can be hard to get to sleep early. I try to be in bed by 10pm, which gives me about four hours of sleep. It's not really enough, but it's tolerable for one day a week to feel human. If I try to sleep earlier, there's a lot of noise as well – my neighbours upstairs are busy living their lives. They're the people that you hate most when you're lying there and trying to get to sleep. I actually get on really well with them, so I have to remind myself that it's not personal and that no one owes me silence. “Noise does affect me, so that can be difficult, but my housemates are very accommodating and keep it down when I'm on an early shift. I try to avoid looking at my phone, but that doesn't always happen, in reality. Some of my colleagues just don't go to bed and come in for their shift a bit earlier and start baking at 2am. I don't think that's very sustainable for me, though! “Thankfully, I live a 10-minute bike-ride away, which means I don't need to rely on public transport or drive in, which is how I make it work. If I lived further afield, I'd be really struggling with those early starts. “The day after the bake, I like to come home and have a bath. I'll be covered in burnt flour and really sweaty, so relaxing in the tub is a nice way to recover. “I'll also sometimes take a nap after that – about 40 minutes or an hour works for me, or I start to feel groggy. I have to see how I feel though. I once went to the cinema for an afternoon showing after an early shift and it ended with me being woken up by an usher. I have no idea how that film ended. “The early shift and limited sleep has a big impact on my social life and romantic life and the people I live with. Many people doing this kind of work are in relatively precarious housing situations, such as house shares, with a high turnover of housemates...."

1lfayrc,2025-06-19 13:34:31,en,REDDIT,"  Okay. I will start by saying, all of this epstein stuff is so hush hush. The reason these conspiracies are flying out is solely because there's so much room for interpretation. It's so fucking crazy that nearly 6 years later we still have zero sort of explanation on this. Basically all that came out was that he was this pedophile guy who just happens to be a billionaire with a private island. He loved to invite notorious scientist/world leaders to the island. I've been captivated by this whole story for probally two years. There is so much misinformation and bullshit out there. I will be explaining my research today, while trying to avoid misinformation and pure “theory” Ok, so I will start by asking a couple questions. - Why haven't we gotten answers? - Why is completely reasonable to assume the FBI blatantly tried to ignore victims? - Why is there so much misinformation & secrecy? I think the easiest way to start this is to talk about how epstein got his money. Easy answer, Les Werner. Wexner, the owner of victoria's secret & bath & body works; gave epstein full control of his finances, a new york estate, a private plane, and an estate in ohio. okay…. . that just seems odd doesn't it? no need to theorize about that. All he was to wexner was his financial adviser. Let me ask you this. even you guys had all the money in the world, would you just give your financial adviser such a copious set of assets? The answer is no. Nobody would just give that shit away. Wexner either was blackmailed or it was a swap of some sorts for epstein's services. Ok so now that we know how he got his money now we can talk about his purpose. It is very obvious that epstein was more than just some pedo financial adviser. Epstein ran a human tracking ring through his connections and power. He had a WHOLE PRIVATE FUCKING ISLAND. Not to abnormal right? just a rich guy who likes to be on a beautiful island? bullshit. His island was not just some resort. It was his own private little world. No eyes, no law, no rules. He used his island to further fuel his spiritual desires. Take the famous temple for example. Before 2019 it looked completely different. I can show you this picture as there are finally images inside this temple. Image is up top. Now let's get to my theory. This is quite literally the only thing we can do now as it seems that trump is doing everything he can to keep this sealed. Theory is as followed, Epstein was an individual who craved power. It did not matter to him what he had to do to feel that sense of power. He also was very fucking smart. I think his “isreal connection” was solely a facade in order to blackmail some of the world's most powerful people. I believe that's also why we have not yet seen much on this whole story. It would be too much of an issue. It would cause so many issues...."

Now my disclaimer is that I wear whatever scents I want all year long so I'm not always the best at saying what's good in warm vs cold weather 😂 I also recommend spraying your clothes if you don't mind doing that. Bath and Body Works Midnight Temptation, pair it with the lotion to up longevity. It's very similar to Black Opium Le Parfum. Just spray the heck out of your body and clothes. Sol De Janeiro the edt paired with 62 body spray. This is actually a summer scent for me, so I get the 8ml in the edt and a small body spray, theis will be about $40 to $50 for both, but the sprays go on sale a lot. If you can swing a small bum bum cream and the glow oil, I highly recommend. This is a compliment getter! I wouldn't recommend blind buying but a lot of Mancera perfumes are crazy strong. I got a 4oz of Roses vanille on Jomashop for $60ish. I've barely made a dent cuz she's strong! Lattafa Liam Grey less than $25 for 100 ml bottle. This is a dupe for BDK Gris Chanel, but it's stronger and longer lasting. This smells like money, but I would recommend testing out the OG to see if you like that scent DNA. Adam Levine, around $15 but I've seen it way lower. This smells way more expensive than what it is and it projects. Avon Imari Elixir. It smells niche. You can find it on EBay with free delivery for less than  $15. If you are a fan of roses- French Avenue Rose Explosion. This is like being at the flower shop and you walk in right as they are cutting down the rosettes to make a bouquet, you smell  fresh petals, leaves, and stems. It's a dupe for atomic rose. $22 on Amazon Paris Hilton Gold Rush pair it with the body spray. It smells really good, the best in the line. You can get both, 100 ml perfume and 8oz spray for less than $40 on Amazon. Guess Seductive Noir. So good. Very similar to Mon Guerlain. $22 for a 2.5 0z bottle and $13 for the body spray on Amazon. People rave about this fragrance and it deserves all the hype! Narciso Rodriguez has a lot of great perfumes $60 or under. I really like For Her edt and Musc Noir Rose (this would probably be too musky), the projection is good on both, stays on clothes until you wash them. Lattafa Mayar Natural Intense. A freshy that projects and has some longevity. $20 on Amazon. Lattafa Angham. This is beautifully done. And it projects and lasts longer than Burberry Goddess. $30ish on Amazon. Lastly if you really want to project and you don't get headaches try Ciara by Revlon. She's strong and surprisingly unique. Less than $15 on Amazon. You can probably find some of these even cheaper but Im addicted to 2 day shipping"

tw_sl_f0ee9774f9a5c0fcfea6c6864507f13a,2025-06-19 21:22:11,en,WEB,"  Routine patrol cops came along just in time Thursday to cuff a shoplifter on Coney Island's boardwalk — while one of the NYPD's special new “quality-of-life” teams ignored a crew of apparently strung-out homeless junkies who commandeered a nearby gazebo. Officers on regular duty with the 60th Precinct happened to be in the right place at the right time to bust a thief who private store security was holding at the Brooklyn Beach Shop. “I called 911, and it was taking a little while for them to answer, and it was just quicker for me to flag an officer down who happened to be right outside,” store owner Maya Miller told The Post. As for the separate special five-member quality-of-life cop squad — part of Police Commissioner Jessica Tisch's initiative to crack down on the most frequent 311 complaints — its members warned a dog owner about having his pup off a leash and escorted a scooter-riding scofflaw off the boardwalk. But the quality-of-life cops walked past an apparent homeless encampment in a beachfront gazebo without doing anything — even though The Post pointed it out to the officers and police brass have said such issues would be a focal point of the special teams. Explore More Locals griped that the unwelcome denizens are a constant nuisance. “Those homeless guys up there? We came here at 10 a.m., and they were here,” said resident Noely Quinones. “They crash here. Quality-of-cops are going to start enforcing? I hope they do something right.” Bath Beach resident Joe Tragona and his wife, Diane, said the encampment is an ongoing issue. “We both grew up here, and we've been coming here our whole lives, and on the whole, it's always pretty good with the police. I mean, they do a great job,” Tragona said. “But when it starts to get dark, it's chaos,” he said. “People having too much to drink getting too wild. You can't really be down here then.” Diane Tragona added, “It's always homeless people in there. “It's an issue we'd like to see them clean that up.” The gazebo encampment was still there after the special police squad called it a day. The NYPD squad walking the boardwalk was the latest display of the new unit — part of the crew of 16 cops assigned to Q-Team duty in the 60th Precinct. Tisch launched the effort in February and said the teams will ultimately patrol citywide for everyday nuisances such as open drug use, illegal vending, trash and other headaches for average New Yorkers. “We're going to roll out citywide very quickly over the course of the summer,” said NYPD Chief William Glenn, head of the department's Quality of Life Unit. “With Manhattan North and Manhattan South mid-July and then soon after that the entire city. “In just six commands alone, they've answered nearly 10,000 quality of life jobs, and they have done it responding 17 minutes faster than we had a year ago,” Glenn said. “If we encounter anyone who needs services — homeless encampments, something along those lines — we're going to address it.” In April, one Q-Team hit a Brooklyn neighborhood where locals had long complained about abandoned cars and illegally parked vehicles and issued dozens of summonses in the 75th Precinct. Miller the Coney Island shop owner told The Post on Thursday, “I'm a big fan of the quality-of-life enforcement that they just put on. “They can fill gaps in communication down here,” Miller said.

A 2-in-1 nausea relief inhaler designed to work FAST on spontaneous nausea, motion sickness, morning sickness, and general queasiness (having a human body is hard). Summer road trips and cruises just got a HECK of a lot more bearable. You can either use it as a scent inhaler or rub it directly on the tip of your nose for relief. Promising review: ""Took this on my first cruise. Anytime that I started to feel woozy I'd reach for it. I'm sure the required act of deep breathing helped a lot - and breathing in the fragrance of the essential oil is very calming and effective. Worked for me! Wonderful!"" —Willy&Lilly Get a pack of two from Amazon for $12.99 (also available in a pack of four). 2. A set of heavy duty Tub O Towels wipes that are most definitely not here to play — they're basically the paper towel version of The Rock and can lift up stains on anything from grease to permanent marker to nail polish. Bonus: they're tough on stains, but the aloe vera in them makes them super gentle on skin! Promising review: ""This stuff really is magical! When we moved into our house, the previous owners did a horrible job of cleaning the stainless-steel appliances. There were permanent run marks going down the front that I could not remove....and I tried EVERYTHING. I should note that I'm not actually positive that these appliances are true stainless steel or just manufactured to look like that. I wanted to cry tears of joy after wiping down the dishwasher because I had been looking at those awful run marks for three years, and they were finally gone! The whole tub is worth it for that appliance alone."" —MayBae Get a pack of 90 from Amazon for $14.98. 3.

Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and un-touched. Delivery was very quick so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hyper sensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive."" —Tracey Agopian Get a ten-pack from Amazon for $9.99. 4. And if it's too late for that, a set of kid-friendly hydrocolloid mosquito itch relief patches you can wear at the beach, pool, bath, or shower without worrying about them sliding off.

I think you're clearly motivated in an earnest fashion to tell stories that border on or go all the way into taboo as you explore the existence of people, and I admire that despite the questionable nature of works that sometimes results in. But, uh, you're on your own today. I don't have anything to say to mitigate this one, what the hell girl. Urgh, right, so, today's manga is **Sayonara, Otokonoko**. It was published from 2016 to 2020 across… neither Anilist or M AL knows how many chapters but there's three volumes. Only eight seem to be translated, and the latter five are by someone who self-admittedly was using a Korean Translation rather than the Japanese raws, *and they don't speak Korean*. There is a certain charm to fan translations and obscure manga, I suppose. > One day, 25-year-old Hajima Kanade wakes up to find himself in a child's body. While his live-in lover Kawata Yuuki freaks out, Kanade tries to take it as calmly as possible. Before they are able to figure out what to do, Yuuki's younger brother knocks on their door. Will Kanade be able to keep his cool? He sexually interacts with the kid version o f his boyfriend. He says no at first, and then the kid tries to make a sexual advance. Which, okay, fine, natural topic to bring up in this weird premise. But then they're in the bath and after a lot of urging he caves to getting him off. There's also the bit where he explicitly says his child dick is “cute” while blushing. I could swallow the stepbrother thing a while back but… seriously? Being closeted from family is explored a little, but nothing about the story stood out enough to make me want to read any more after that. I dropped it after chapter three."
myyi3mh,2025-06-21 08:55:29,en,REDDIT,"  Sooo I LOVEEE night walks esp. around the full moon… something about doing it at night it's just really peaceful. And now that I've got dogs we do night walks too. I used to have a ton of rescues & most of the exotics were nocturnal so that was always something. I can help you with any potential pet question esp. exotic & weird stuff. I used to try & go REALLY hard trying to get as much stuff done as possible when I'd be awake (cleaning, organizing, clearing out storage units, unpacking new place, etc. & I'd LOVE to have in my AirPods & listen to certain podcasts or Audiobooks. I mentioned those bc some they block sound & some are creepy so if say someone woke up & touched me on the back I'd prob. scream lol. ^^^I'm ADHD so for tasks that don't require thinking like work or school then something about the podcast taking up part of my brain & doing mindless things works well. I also tend to get really creative at night & like to paint or do crafts. I feel like night time thoughts & energy is different than daytime stuff. I've learned that I can't do that nonstop on my body anymore so I may do half stuff, but my body needs to rest in all aspects so I've got a sleep mask I'm addicted to & I make sure that I lay down in the dark, cold quiet & physically & mentally relax if I can't sleep or else my body stops being able to do it. It's like “nope none of this anymore”. ^^^If you don't like silence in the dark you can check out Binary Beats on YouTube or something… some have different kind of background things happening & then go dark after 30min-1 hour. (Those are supposed to help you sleep). There's a ton of insomnia podcasts lol, but usually I get too interested in what it is, but I do something more what I know or not scary. Like I LOVE Bailey Serian (sry if I misspelled her name) & she's got 2 podcasts I love. Dark History is my fav. of hers & then Murder, Makeup Mondays or something like that. She releases new episodes of both on different days. The 2nd one I mentioned she's been doing it for FOREVERRR. Most music isn't good bc I know all the lyrics or it reminds me of something or I want to start a new playlist & then I go down a rabbit hole of something… peaceful stuff like Enya is good for me. ORRR I put on shows on the background that I've watched a million times so I don't need to watch it & it's comforting like The Office or Parks & Rec. or Modern Family, etc. I've got a watchlist just for my dogs & cats if I'm not home haha so it's always sweet, not scary stuff for them to have on. ORRRR I love to do self-care that takes forever. Like I'm a bath queen… you think you know a cool bath experience until I go all in. Maybe doing a facial or my nails or things I don't have time to do during the day. ORRRR I love to cook (bake esp.) & I like to do it better at night. Something about it is really calming & relaxing for me. I esp. love baking. I usually like to watch TV or listen to music when I'm doing this. But if you're something in that likes to meal prep or have food set up for the week or baking for someone that's something I like. I do like to OCD really clean haha & I'm a weirdo. Or I'm like a maintenance person& I like to do stuff around the house that never gets done at dark like changing lightbulbs, fixing the dryer, putting new batteries into things, setting light timers, changing the AC filter things, putting together anything I buy online bc it always is a projects… or building things like planter boxes or I've been working on doing built-bookcases in a  little library nook area or I'll make canvases ORRRR I super hyper-focus & like learning about new stuff, research, side hustles, courses - Haha I usually procrastinate work. Online shopping esp. if I'm looking for reviews or researching products. Cleaning up my devices from clutter. Making notes & to-do lists & things I'll never do ha. Deal with customer service esp. if 24hours is a thing no wait time & I hate it & get it done. I LOVEEE to pre-schedule emails & texts for work or I'm ADHD & want to text something x, y, z so maybe I crash in the AM, but it looks like I'm ontop of things & working hard I work remotely & hate it so that makes life a lot easier & that calms my anxiety a bit. ORRRRR I doom scroll. I've got most socials & news not on my phone for a bit…. I've got Reddit, but I've been trying to get better about that...."

mov_D1DF369EDAE27A4FDB389415FBB2FC5B,2025-06-21 14:50:19,en,WEB,"  When the weather warms up, many of us use a nice cold shower to help us cool down. But while this might feel like relief, it might actually not be helping the body cool off at all. Our body's optimal temperature is around 37°C. This temperatures ensures our body systems can function properly. But when the core gets too hot the temperature regulating centre of the brain starts sending nervous signals out to the blood vessels and muscles in or near the skin – telling them to start activating their cooling mechanisms. If our core stays at high temperature for too long (around 39-40°C), this can lead to organ damage. So to ensure our temperature stays optimal, the body uses multiple techniques to cool itself down. For instance, the body radiates heat into the surrounding environment by electromagnetic (thermal) radiation. Approximately 60% of our body heat is lost this way. Sweating is another mechanism the body uses. Around 22% of our body heat is lost this way. But when the air temperature around us exceeds our body temperature, sweating becomes the dominant mechanism for reducing core temperature. Any remaining body heat is then lost through a mixture of convection into the air or liquid the body may be in contact with and conduction into solid objects that the body may be in contact with. To support these mechanisms, our blood vessels change diameter. The ones closest to the skin dilate (widen) to allow more blood into them so they can get close to the relatively cooler surface of the skin. The body then works to circulate the blood so that heat from inside the body can be moved to the periphery to cool off. Similarly on our skin, the hairs remain flat to allow air next to the body to cool and be replaced, helping to dissipate heat. Cold shower? Of course, when the weather gets really hot outside, these mechanisms just don't feel like they cut it. Although diving into a cold bath or shower straight after being out in the heat might feel nice on your skin, it isn't doing what is needed to reduce the core temperature of the body. It might also be risky for some people. When exposed to cold, the blood vessels near to the skin constrict – reducing the blood flow into these areas. So in the context of cooling the body down, jumping into a cold shower does the opposite of what needs to happen, as less blood is now flowing to the surface of the skin. This will hold the heat in and around your organs instead of getting rid of it. Basically, you're tricking your body that it doesn't need to cool down, but actually needs to conserve heat. And, depending on how cold your water is, sudden exposure could even trigger dangerous consequences for some people. Exposure to water that is 15°C can trigger the cold shock response. This causes the blood vessels in the skin (those in contact with the cold water) to constrict rapidly. This increases blood pressure as the heart is now pumping against increased resistance. This response can be particularly dangerous in people with underlying heart conditions, such as coronary artery disease. The cold shock response can also lead to an irregular heartbeat and even death when going from very hot to cold. Thankfully, these events are rare – and probably won't happen if you're just taking a cold shower or bath in your home. But you might want to skip the cold plunge or avoid taking an ice bath on a hot day for this reason. Hot showers are also a bad idea on a warm day. Although it's sometimes said that a hot shower helps the body cool down faster, this unfortunately isn't true. Water that is warmer than the body is going to transfer energy in the form of heat into the body. This again prevents the body getting rid of heat – potentially increasing its core temperature. On a hot day, a tepid or lukewarm bath or shower is the way to go, evidence suggests 26-27°C is most effective. This helps bring blood to the surface to cool, without being cold enough to cause the body to think it needs to conserve its heat. Another reason to skip a cold shower on a hot day is that it might not help you get clean. When we get hot, we sweat – and this sweat mixes with sebum, another skin product and the bacteria on our skin, which produces body odour. Cold water has been shown to be less effective at removing and breaking down sebum and other detritus on the skin, compared to warmer water, which means body odour will persist. Cold water also causes the skin to tighten. This might potentially trap sebum and dirt within the pores. This can lead to blackheads, whiteheads and acne. But warm or lukewarm water can help dissolve and loosen material in the pores. As you plan your escape and recovery from the heat this week, a lukewarm or cool shower or bath, rather than a cold shower, is a safer and more effective choice. This will allow your body to dissipate heat away from your core without harm. Equally, if you do feel the need to go cooler, do it gradually so you aren't shocking the body's automatic temperature regulation system into action. Turning the temperature down gradually if you want to go cold, or slowly placing a limb in at a time can help with this process."

The Ordinary's Multi-Depth Hydration Serum — it combines the hydrating power of hyaluronic acid with the hydration-locking powers of vitamin B5 and the skin-barrier-supporting powers of ceramides. That's the most dynamic trio since Donna and the Dynamos. Those blinding ""Super Trouper"" lights they were singing about?? It was actually just your glowing skin. ✨ Promising review: ""Makes skin very glowy and elastic! I love to use The Ordinary for my skincare. I have tried several of their products, and the best things I like about them is their affordable prices and quality. This serum is thick but lightweight and absorbs fairly quickly while leaving a smooth layer on top. I use it every night before bed, and I wake up every morning with my skin feeling super soft, hydrated, and plump... Definitely would recommend, it gives you glassy skin that you will love!"" —Rina Get it from Amazon for $9.90 (also available in a two-pack). 2. A next-level toothbrush your dentist will be so ridiculously proud of you for using. It has the standard bristles you'd expect from any toothbrush, but the game-changer is the extra-long bristles that are 10x thinner — meaning they can reach in between teeth and under the gum line to help sweep away food and residue. Here's what one of our BuzzFeed Shopping writers, Emma Lord, has to say: ""I love it just after the first few days of use! I use an electric toothbrush usually, but I feel like I'm getting a much more satisfying clean from these?? Especially because I tend to get yellow stains between my teeth no matter *how* much I floss, and these bristles seem to actually target that a lot more effectively."" Promising review: ""I'm amazed at how well this toothbrush cleans my teeth — it definitely gets between the teeth and also, more importantly for me, gets in the small, deep crevices in my molars where I always have food stuck, and regular toothbrushes couldn't get stuff out. I brush more often (after meals/snacks) because of how effective it is. As stated, definitely go easy around the gums. The bristles feel soft, but will cause your gums to bleed if you use regular pressure. Nice and easy does the trick, SO WELL!"" —Jason A. Mouthwatchers is a small business established by Ronald Plotka, DDS, that specializes in antimicrobial toothbrushes designed to get deeper cleans that even patients with ""great"" dental hygiene might miss with traditional brush and floss routines.

The reusable strips are made of medical-grade silicone, which can help reduce moisture loss and increase hydration. All you have to do is remove the adhesive backing and place them on your scar 12–24 hours a day. Note: The reviewer above shows results from wearing them 24 hours a day for six months. The strips are easily washable and can be reused for up to a week before replacing. According to the brand, you may see results in six weeks for new scars or four to six months for old scars. Learn more about how silicone can help with scarring from the National Library of Medicine. Talk to your doctor before attempting to treat your keloid on your own, and learn more about keloids from Cleveland Clinic. Promising review: ""I had surgery, and it resulted in a keloid scar that created a big dent in my abdomen. I have used this scar tape for four months, and I cannot believe the difference! Within 2 weeks, the keloid bumps were down and it has gently pulled up the dented scar to make it flat. You wash it daily, usually right before I shower, then continue wearing the same piece for a week. It is cost-effective and works so well!! If you are on the fence about trying it, wait no longer. I cannot say enough good things about this product."" —Amazon Customer Get a pack of four from Amazon for $22.99. 4. A pair of handheld scrapers to make your cast iron pans look as good as the day you bought them. It's gentle enough to use on nonstick surfaces, and unlike a sponge, this won't trap a bunch of food particles that are hard to rinse out. Now you can spend less time cleaning and more time whipping up culinary masterpieces...."
mov_0CF5AAE21059321489DE8C4692A5F148,2025-06-22 10:04:18,en,WEB,"  For my junior and senior years of high school, I transferred from McKinley High to Timken Vocational High School with dreams of becoming a commercial artist. No one apparently had the heart to tell me the truth about my level of talent. However, many of the skills I learned in the late Raymond Coia's classroom, I still use to this day. Today, Canton City Schools and other public districts are concerned because student participation in vocational education is so low that they may be at the risk in the future of having to sell a building like Timken to a charter school for failure to reach a 60% occupancy threshold, according to a measure found in the state's proposed education budget. Public districts must formulate more aggressive strategies to engage and recruit more students in pursuing vocational education at an earlier age. Need a break? Play the USA TODAY Daily Crossword Puzzle. By high school, it's often too late. But it's complicated. For one thing, teachers everywhere are tearing out their hair just to get some kids to pay attention. It's nearly impossible to compete with social media, which delivers a dopamine hit to the brain with every click. Vocational education also is hampered by a shrinking number of teachers who are certified to teach the curricula. Those who are qualified often seek jobs in the private sector for higher pay and, frankly, less stress. According to the Brookings Institution: ""National data shows that administrators report having difficulty filling (teaching) positions in career and technical education, 57% of the time, compared to only 39% for openings in academic subjects."" Another hurdle is that in recent decades, vocational education has not been viewed or valued on par with college but this is a mistake. In Ohio, the need for skilled ""tool belt"" workers is at an all-time high. Meanwhile, manufacturers and apprenticeship programs are begging for trainees. Some countries have it figured out. Throughout Europe, and in Germany in particular, students are exposed to vocational education as early as age 10. They have access to short internships in ninth grade, followed by yearlong, one-day-a-week job placements in their sophomore year. However, European school systems have become more flexible, allowing students to choose a hybrid, combining college prep and vocational training. There is some good news. The National Student Clearinghouse Research Center reports that: ""The number of students enrolled in vocational-focused community colleges increased 16% from 2022 to 2023."" The growth is being led by Generation Z, who have grown up hearing horror stories about student-loan indebtedness, which appears rigged to keep people in hock. That doesn't mean college has lost its value. You often hear people castigating colleges as incubators for radicalism, and as institutions that aren't worth the investment. When rich people stop sending their kids to college, then you'll know it's a scam. That said, if the country was really serious about wanting a more educated populace, student loans would not be attached to exorbitant and punitive interest rates in which a person can pay on a loan for 25 years and barely put a dent on the principle. With a college graduate rate more than double that of Stark County's 25%, Delaware County near Columbus is a perfect argument for why college still matters. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, 58% of its residents are college grads. The region can't build public schools fast enough, as people flock there for jobs at Google and Amazon and such Fortune 500 companies as Nationwide, Cardinal Health, American Electric Power, Huntington Bancshares, and Bath & Body Works. That's where carpenters, roofers, plumbers, welders, HVAC installers and heavy-equipment operators come in. Someone has to build those new schools, new neighborhoods, strip malls and corporate campuses. In the years to come, artificial intelligence will undoubtedly replace some technology jobs, which currently pay well because they require a college degree. But there's no such thing as a robot that can shingle a roof or install a toilet. At least, not yet. Charita M. Goshay is a Canton Repository staff writer and member of the editorial board.

Some foodies are riding the wave even further, skipping any brain-enhancing active ingredients altogether and instead turning to the realm of elevated mocktails and (yes) dirty sodas. If you haven't heard of it before, dirty soda is a popular non-alcoholic beverage that's been trending on TikTok (consumer base younger than 21) and dominating Utah (high concentration of folks with religious dietary restrictions) in recent years. At its core, dirty soda is regular soda topped with flavored syrup and cream. From this essential foundation, dirty sodas can vary dramatically. Perhaps the greatest appeal of the dirty soda is its vast potential for customizability, which has also led to many home cooks trying their hand at creating new drink flavors and sharing them on social media. Today, we're taking a look at one dessert-inspired dirty soda flavor that's been getting some major traction online: The root beer float-a. All it takes is three ingredients to make: Root beer, toasted marshmallow syrup, and half-and-half. In a pint glass loaded to the rim with crushed or pebble ice, fill with root beer, leaving about one inch of room. Then, add a generous slug of toasted marshmallow syrup and a splash of half-and-half, stirring to combine. A long-handled spoon works well, or you can press the lid on and swirl the drink by vigorously circling your wrist. Pop in a straw and enjoy. Combine Root Beer, Toasted Marshmallow Syrup, And Half-And-Half For The Ultimate Dirty Float Root beer float - Food Arena/Shutterstock It's worth mentioning that root beer and half-and-half can be found in pretty much any grocery store. The third (and arguably most crucial) ingredient to this ""black cow"" root beer float dupe -- the toasted marshmallow syrup -- might need to be ordered online. Luckily, many popular flavored syrup brands like Monin and Torani are widely available for making avant-garde bevy creations. A 25.4-ounce bottle of Torani toasted marshmallow syrup runs for $14.99 on Amazon, and, considering you'll only need a pump or two per drink, it's an investment that stretches a long way. Monin also makes a toasted marshmallow flavored syrup, and it reminds us of a cozy Bath & Body Works candle (in a good way). For a fun birthday party, you could pair that dirty root beer float soda with these playful root beer float cupcakes. Or, for more dessert-like flair, skip the half-and-half and add a scoop of vanilla ice cream to the top of your cup. As it melts, the ice cream will trickle down into the drink for the creamy element. At brick-and-mortar chains like Swig, Sodalicious, and Fiiz, where fans can hit the drive-thru for their favorite dirty sodas, the drinks are typically served in large, tall cups, so feel free to bust out your largest drink receptacle for this reimagined float."

Your GP might put you on Gabapentin, which is a nerval pain killer. It works for most people but you might not be responsive to it because it's a bit of a hit and miss for some people. I went on it and it didn't work but I've heard that for others it works wonders! Kinetic tape helps stabilise joints like ankles if you have pain there. If you have access to a bath, get Epsom salts, you can get them on Amazon, and they're pretty good too. Heat packs are a must have but unfortunately not the whether for it at the moment. Warm showers and baths are great, CBT lotion off Amazon is also pretty good. Unfortunately it's just a case of learning what your body does and doesn't like, but sometimes it can literally just be waking up and your body has decided to tell you to go do one and you're in pain. Just try and take it as easy as possible. Don't push it. If you feel like you're going to flare then take it easy.

mov_8481263708F4F1EC9988BDA0544A742C,2025-06-23 09:01:01,en,WEB,"  Hello and welcome to Track of Words for today's author interview with the fantastic Grace Chan, in which we're going to be talking about her debut novel Every Version of You – out now from Verve Books. Set in Australia in the not-too-distant future, Every Version of You is a darkly fascinating exploration of identity, environment and technological impact, the sort of book that hooks you in and leaves you thinking about it for a long time afterwards. I was delighted to have the chance to chat to Grace about this intriguing book – I hope you enjoy this interview, and I really recommend picking up Every Version of You! ToW: To start things off, can you give us an overview of Every Version of You and what readers can expect from it? Grace Chan: Tao-Yi and her partner Navin spend most of their time inside an immersive virtual reality called Gaia. Meanwhile, their aging bodies lie suspended in pods inside cramped apartments. On the outskirts of Melbourne, in the decaying real world, Tao-Yi's mother remains stubbornly offline, dwindling away between hospital visits and memories of her life in Malaysia. When a new technology is developed to permanently upload a human brain into Gaia, Tao-Yi must decide what is most important to her. I wrote Every Version of You to grapple with various ideas: the different phases of love and loss, the impermanence of all things, climate devastation, our incessant consumption of technology and content, our relationships with our bodies. ToW: You've got a couple of key characters in Every Version of You – without spoiling anything, could you give us a quick sense of who Tao-Yi and Navin are, and what readers might need to know about them? GC: Tao-Yi is a Malaysian-Chinese immigrant to Australia. She works as an Authenticity Consultant: a new-era, corporation-employed therapist to youngsters with existential crises. Navin moves to Melbourne for Tao-Yi, but the surgery that Tao-Yi organises for Navin goes wrong, and now he lives with chronic pain. Their relationship has grown complex and tender over the years, but they are pulled in different directions as technology and ecological collapse accelerate around them. Navin is increasingly drawn into the virtual, yearning to leave his body behind. Tao-Yi is grappling with her “perpetual homesickness”, trying to figure out what anchors her: is it her relationships, her heritage, her body, or something else? ToW: You set this story in a not-too-far future Australia, which feels worryingly believable. Could you talk a bit about that setting, and some of the key elements of the global backstory you went with? GC: I haven't seen much science fiction set in the country that I grew up in, so I knew from the get-go that I wanted to feature places that are close to home. In the first draft, the story took place in the 22nd century, but I quickly realised that the future I was describing felt much closer to the present day. Bringing it into the late 21st century gives it that “worryingly believable-ness,” I think—the climate devastation and the dependence on technology feel more present-day than science-fiction. I allude to certain global events, like the complete fracturing of the Australian-US alliance. Navin talks about the destitution in San Francisco. I didn't go into worldbuilding in detail, but I imagined the US becoming increasingly authoritarian, to the detriment of its citizens and leading to a mid-century war. The state of the climate is an extrapolation from today, if we continue to do very little. In Every Version of You, people have buried their heads in technology, because it's shiny and easy. ToW: When you were planning and writing this story, was there ever a point when you thought you might opt for a less dystopian vision of the future, without the history of war and climate disaster? I wonder how something like Uploading would look without the sense of escaping from a dying world… GC: I wish I could say I did consider a less dystopian world, but alas – I did not. The funny thing is, I wasn't consciously trying to craft a dystopia. I was merely trying to extrapolate from the present. I suppose that's a depressing rather than funny answer, but I suspect it's also why many readers have found the book confronting and relevant! It certainly would be cool to imagine a virtual world with grassroots origins, designed to benefit the community and interact harmoniously with the environment. ToW: Back to the characters – where did Tao-Yi and Navin come from, and their increasingly complex relationship? Did you have their personalities locked in right from the beginning, or did they evolve over time as you worked on the book? GC: They were there from the very first scribble in my notebook. Their relationship is the core of the novel. Tao-Yi is the brain in the partnership: she is reflective, independent, compassionate, wry, pragmatic, and always trying to find herself by caring for others. Navin is the soul: he is sensitive, earnest, idealistic, intellectual, and romantic. I had a great time getting to know them in more detail as I wrote. After spending years with them, they feel so real to me. Grace's short fiction has been published in all sorts of places, including Clarkesworld magazine ToW: And what about Tao-Yi's mother, Xin-Yi? Their mother-daughter relationship feels like the other key axis of the book, bringing in questions of family history, identity and heritage for Tao-Yi to wrestle with. What was it like building up that relationship and exploring those themes? GC: Honestly, this was such a challenging relationship to develop. Xin-Yi is a rather slippery character: her love for Tao-Yi is intense but carefully concealed, mixed-up with shame about her depression, the loss of migrating to a new country, and leaving behind so much of her family and her culture. It took a long time to feel satisfied that I had given their relationship enough depth. I travelled to Malaysia and walked around Ipoh, which is my mother's hometown. I redrafted the mother-daughter scenes many times and wrote background notes on Tao-Yi, Xin-Yi, and Tao-Yi's grandmother to help me to understand the characters as real people: complex, multifaceted, uncategorisable. ToW: I found the idea of the technology at play in the book both intriguing and disturbing – the endless possibilities of Gaia contrasting with what's been lost to both technology and environmental damage. The way Tao-Yi reflects on not remembering the taste of real meat, or not knowing how close scents in Gaia are to the real-world originals...."

mov_101FFA9F3DA34C5DD4F6F0D73A9A6C20,2025-06-24 11:49:19,en,WEB,"  An Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) investigation into how West Mercia Police (WMP) responded to incidents concerning Alfie Steele found no indication that any officers had breached professional standards, but that the force did not sufficiently train frontline officers to identify child abuse. Alfie, aged nine, died at his home in Droitwich, in February 2021 after repeatedly being abused, including being put in a cold bath. His mother, Carla Scott, was found guilty of manslaughter and her partner, Dirk Howell, was convicted of murder in June 2023. The pair had a significant amount of contact with WMP in the years before Alfie died. After the court case concluded, the force made a mandatory referral to the IOPC in relation to that prior contact. During the course of our investigation, we examined 20 separate incidents where the force had interactions with Alfie, his mother or her partner, between March 2018 and February 2021, which were repeatedly about welfare concerns reported by worried neighbours and eyewitnesses. Although every call made to WMP was responded to, a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. The climate of fear which existed within the family home often led to Alfie being in bed allegedly asleep during many of the times police were called. Alfie's mother also often answered any questions on his behalf, which meant his voice was never heard by police. We identified learning in relation to putting warning markers on WMP command and control logs highlighting that a child at a particular address is the subject of a Child Protection Plan. We also recommended that force policies regarding referrals to children's services are reviewed to ensure they are fit for purpose. WMP accepted and implemented these areas of learning. IOPC Director Derrick Campbell said: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice. On some occasions officers lacked professional curiosity and could have undertaken further enquiries. “There was a culture of fear within the household which, when coupled with lockdown, severely reduced Alfie's world. There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. “In that cruel environment, Alfie appears to have had to adopt extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. “It is reassuring that West Mercia Police have committed to ensuring that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. We have been advised that since we began our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child.” During the IOPC investigation which ended in February this year, we reviewed a wealth of documentation detailing all 20 police contacts including statements from police officers, social workers and neighbours, crime and investigation reports, police logs, children's services' records, 999 calls, body worn video and ring doorbell footage. We considered a range of child protection policies and procedures along with relevant legislation. Notes to Editors Examples of the incidents we scrutinised include: On an evening in May 2020, WMP were contacted by concerned neighbours stating that a child they believed to be Alfie was standing 'like a statue' in the garden with a man shouting at him. The neighbour added that the child had been outside for approximately 10 minutes and the shouting had continued after the child had gone back inside the house. Attending officers checked with social workers and were informed that the occupants were known to social services and that Dirk Howell posed a risk to Alfie and should not be there, although there was no order enforcing this. Body worn video we examined showed Alfie's mother repeatedly stating that her partner was not there, however the officer remained persistent and eventually Howell left the property. The officer checked on Alfie by asking him if he was 'alright'. Alfie nodded but did not speak and he was not asked about the garden incident. There was no evidence that the caller was spoken to again to obtain further information. Howell was not asked for his account, despite being seen and briefly spoken to by the officer when he left the address. An evening in August 2020 a neighbour rang WMP about concerns for Alfie's safety, stating that it seemed like he was being “hurt”, and a man could be heard shouting and swearing, with someone “thrashing around the bath…maybe he's being hit and held under the water or something”. The call was graded 'immediate' and a few minutes later the police log was updated to show that Alfie was subject to a care plan. Two officers went to Alfie's home just before 9pm. One of the officers spoke to Alfie's mother who said he was “playing up in the bath, so he was told off”. Both officers went upstairs to check on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his bedroom. They concluded that he was 'safe and well' although acknowledged he may still be the subject of abuse. There was no record of Alfie being spoken to in order to get his account of the noises heard. One of the officers said that although they were aware Mr Howell was home, they did not see him. The officers were informed Mr Howell was not meant to have contact with Alfie due to the concerns social services had. However, there were no police powers to enforce his removal from the address, so they were unable to take any action. Police contacted children's services the following day to inform them of their attendance. This incident occurred six months prior to Alfie's murder...."

A police force which was repeatedly in contact with the killers of a nine-year-old boy who was assaulted, beaten and murdered in the family home did not sufficiently train officers to identify child abuse, a watchdog has found. Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished.

The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions.

This led to significant changes and training put in place for our frontline officers and staff to ensure the signs of child abuse and vulnerability are fully understood. “To ensure an independent assessment and that appropriate scrutiny was applied, in June 2023, we referred our contact with the family prior to Alfie's death to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. “It is essential we do everything within our powers to keep children safe, and that our communities have faith that we will do everything to keep children safe. There is no doubt protecting children is one of the most important things we do. “Since then, we have extended this training to raise awareness to all officers and staff the importance to capture the voice of the child – using professional curiosity to speak and listen to children and understand their fears and concerns.

Nine-year-old Alfie was covered in bruises (West Mercia Police/PA) A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. Carla Scott was found guilty of her son's manslaughter (West Mercia Police/PA) An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice. On some occasions officers lacked professional curiosity and could have undertaken further inquiries. Dirk Howell was jailed for life with a minimum term of 32 years for Alfie's murder (West Mercia Police/PA) “There was a culture of fear within the household which, when coupled with lockdown, severely reduced Alfie's world. There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. “Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. “In that cruel environment, Alfie appears to have had to adopt extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. “It is reassuring that West Mercia Police have committed to ensuring that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. “We have been advised that since we began our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child.” In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Jones, of West Mercia Police, said: “The loss Alfie's family has experienced is immeasurable and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to those who knew him and will forever miss him. “Alfie died after he was inflicted with indescribable abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner and both are now serving considerable prison sentences for his death. “The death of a child in such horrific circumstances is abhorrent and in the immediate aftermath of Alfie's death we carried out a review. This led to significant changes and training put in place for our frontline officers and staff to ensure the signs of child abuse and vulnerability are fully understood. “To ensure an independent assessment and that appropriate scrutiny was applied, in June 2023, we referred our contact with the family prior to Alfie's death to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. “It is essential we do everything within our powers to keep children safe, and that our communities have faith that we will do everything to keep children safe. There is no doubt protecting children is one of the most important things we do. “Since then, we have extended this training to raise awareness to all officers and staff the importance to capture the voice of the child – using professional curiosity to speak and listen to children and understand their fears and concerns. Or what they don't say. “It has been our mission to share Alfie's story with our entire workforce to highlight the importance of this and how vital it is we get it right. We must put safeguards in place to make sure no child ever suffers like that again. “It is with the greatest sadness we will never be able to undo the dreadful abuse Alfie suffered and our thoughts remain with his family, friends and loved ones.”"

Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance.

Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice. On some occasions officers lacked professional curiosity and could have undertaken further inquiries. “There was a culture of fear within the household which, when coupled with lockdown, severely reduced Alfie's world. There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. “Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. “In that cruel environment, Alfie appears to have had to adopt extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. “It is reassuring that West Mercia Police have committed to ensuring that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. “We have been advised that since we began our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child.” In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Jones, of West Mercia Police, said: “The loss Alfie's family has experienced is immeasurable and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to those who knew him and will forever miss him. “Alfie died after he was inflicted with indescribable abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner and both are now serving considerable prison sentences for his death. “The death of a child in such horrific circumstances is abhorrent and in the immediate aftermath of Alfie's death we carried out a review.

There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. Carla Scott was found guilty of her son's manslaughter (West Mercia Police/PA) An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice. On some occasions officers lacked professional curiosity and could have undertaken further inquiries. Dirk Howell was jailed for life with a minimum term of 32 years for Alfie's murder (West Mercia Police/PA) “There was a culture of fear within the household which, when coupled with lockdown, severely reduced Alfie's world. There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. “Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. “In that cruel environment, Alfie appears to have had to adopt extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. “It is reassuring that West Mercia Police have committed to ensuring that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. “We have been advised that since we began our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child.” In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Jones, of West Mercia Police, said: “The loss Alfie's family has experienced is immeasurable and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to those who knew him and will forever miss him. “Alfie died after he was inflicted with indescribable abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner and both are now serving considerable prison sentences for his death. “The death of a child in such horrific circumstances is abhorrent and in the immediate aftermath of Alfie's death we carried out a review. This led to significant changes and training put in place for our frontline officers and staff to ensure the signs of child abuse and vulnerability are fully understood. “To ensure an independent assessment and that appropriate scrutiny was applied, in June 2023, we referred our contact with the family prior to Alfie's death to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. “It is essential we do everything within our powers to keep children safe, and that our communities have faith that we will do everything to keep children safe. There is no doubt protecting children is one of the most important things we do. “Since then, we have extended this training to raise awareness to all officers and staff the importance to capture the voice of the child – using professional curiosity to speak and listen to children and understand their fears and concerns. Or what they don't say. “It has been our mission to share Alfie's story with our entire workforce to highlight the importance of this and how vital it is we get it right. We must put safeguards in place to make sure no child ever suffers like that again. “It is with the greatest sadness we will never be able to undo the dreadful abuse Alfie suffered and our thoughts remain with his family, friends and loved ones.”"

Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. Nine-year-old Alfie was covered in bruises (West Mercia Police/PA) A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. Carla Scott was found guilty of her son's manslaughter (West Mercia Police/PA) An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice.

There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. Carla Scott was found guilty of her son's manslaughter (West Mercia Police/PA) An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice. On some occasions officers lacked professional curiosity and could have undertaken further inquiries. Dirk Howell was jailed for life with a minimum term of 32 years for Alfie's murder (West Mercia Police/PA) “There was a culture of fear within the household which, when coupled with lockdown, severely reduced Alfie's world. There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. “Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. “In that cruel environment, Alfie appears to have had to adopt extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. “It is reassuring that West Mercia Police have committed to ensuring that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. “We have been advised that since we began our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child.” In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Jones, of West Mercia Police, said: “The loss Alfie's family has experienced is immeasurable and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to those who knew him and will forever miss him. “Alfie died after he was inflicted with indescribable abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner and both are now serving considerable prison sentences for his death. “The death of a child in such horrific circumstances is abhorrent and in the immediate aftermath of Alfie's death we carried out a review. This led to significant changes and training put in place for our frontline officers and staff to ensure the signs of child abuse and vulnerability are fully understood. “To ensure an independent assessment and that appropriate scrutiny was applied, in June 2023, we referred our contact with the family prior to Alfie's death to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. “It is essential we do everything within our powers to keep children safe, and that our communities have faith that we will do everything to keep children safe. There is no doubt protecting children is one of the most important things we do. “Since then, we have extended this training to raise awareness to all officers and staff the importance to capture the voice of the child – using professional curiosity to speak and listen to children and understand their fears and concerns.

Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. Nine-year-old Alfie was covered in bruises (West Mercia Police/PA) A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. Carla Scott was found guilty of her son's manslaughter (West Mercia Police/PA) An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice.

There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. Carla Scott was found guilty of her son's manslaughter (West Mercia Police/PA) An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice. On some occasions officers lacked professional curiosity and could have undertaken further inquiries. Dirk Howell was jailed for life with a minimum term of 32 years for Alfie's murder (West Mercia Police/PA) “There was a culture of fear within the household which, when coupled with lockdown, severely reduced Alfie's world. There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. “Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. “In that cruel environment, Alfie appears to have had to adopt extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. “It is reassuring that West Mercia Police have committed to ensuring that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. “We have been advised that since we began our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child.” In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Jones, of West Mercia Police, said: “The loss Alfie's family has experienced is immeasurable and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to those who knew him and will forever miss him. “Alfie died after he was inflicted with indescribable abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner and both are now serving considerable prison sentences for his death. “The death of a child in such horrific circumstances is abhorrent and in the immediate aftermath of Alfie's death we carried out a review. This led to significant changes and training put in place for our frontline officers and staff to ensure the signs of child abuse and vulnerability are fully understood. “To ensure an independent assessment and that appropriate scrutiny was applied, in June 2023, we referred our contact with the family prior to Alfie's death to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. “It is essential we do everything within our powers to keep children safe, and that our communities have faith that we will do everything to keep children safe. There is no doubt protecting children is one of the most important things we do. “Since then, we have extended this training to raise awareness to all officers and staff the importance to capture the voice of the child – using professional curiosity to speak and listen to children and understand their fears and concerns. Or what they don't say. “It has been our mission to share Alfie's story with our entire workforce to highlight the importance of this and how vital it is we get it right. We must put safeguards in place to make sure no child ever suffers like that again. “It is with the greatest sadness we will never be able to undo the dreadful abuse Alfie suffered and our thoughts remain with his family, friends and loved ones.”"

Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice.

The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. Carla Scott was found guilty of her son's manslaughter (West Mercia Police/PA) An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice. On some occasions officers lacked professional curiosity and could have undertaken further inquiries. Dirk Howell was jailed for life with a minimum term of 32 years for Alfie's murder (West Mercia Police/PA) “There was a culture of fear within the household which, when coupled with lockdown, severely reduced Alfie's world. There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. “Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. “In that cruel environment, Alfie appears to have had to adopt extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. “It is reassuring that West Mercia Police have committed to ensuring that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. “We have been advised that since we began our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child.” In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Jones, of West Mercia Police, said: “The loss Alfie's family has experienced is immeasurable and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to those who knew him and will forever miss him. “Alfie died after he was inflicted with indescribable abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner and both are now serving considerable prison sentences for his death. “The death of a child in such horrific circumstances is abhorrent and in the immediate aftermath of Alfie's death we carried out a review. This led to significant changes and training put in place for our frontline officers and staff to ensure the signs of child abuse and vulnerability are fully understood. “To ensure an independent assessment and that appropriate scrutiny was applied, in June 2023, we referred our contact with the family prior to Alfie's death to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. “It is essential we do everything within our powers to keep children safe, and that our communities have faith that we will do everything to keep children safe. There is no doubt protecting children is one of the most important things we do. “Since then, we have extended this training to raise awareness to all officers and staff the importance to capture the voice of the child – using professional curiosity to speak and listen to children and understand their fears and concerns. Or what they don't say. “It has been our mission to share Alfie's story with our entire workforce to highlight the importance of this and how vital it is we get it right. We must put safeguards in place to make sure no child ever suffers like that again. “It is with the greatest sadness we will never be able to undo the dreadful abuse Alfie suffered and our thoughts remain with his family, friends and loved ones.”"

Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice.

The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice. On some occasions officers lacked professional curiosity and could have undertaken further inquiries. “There was a culture of fear within the household which, when coupled with lockdown, severely reduced Alfie's world. There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. “Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. “In that cruel environment, Alfie appears to have had to adopt extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. “It is reassuring that West Mercia Police have committed to ensuring that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. “We have been advised that since we began our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child.” In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Jones, of West Mercia Police, said: “The loss Alfie's family has experienced is immeasurable and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to those who knew him and will forever miss him. “Alfie died after he was inflicted with indescribable abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner and both are now serving considerable prison sentences for his death. “The death of a child in such horrific circumstances is abhorrent and in the immediate aftermath of Alfie's death we carried out a review. This led to significant changes and training put in place for our frontline officers and staff to ensure the signs of child abuse and vulnerability are fully understood. “To ensure an independent assessment and that appropriate scrutiny was applied, in June 2023, we referred our contact with the family prior to Alfie's death to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. “It is essential we do everything within our powers to keep children safe, and that our communities have faith that we will do everything to keep children safe. There is no doubt protecting children is one of the most important things we do. “Since then, we have extended this training to raise awareness to all officers and staff the importance to capture the voice of the child – using professional curiosity to speak and listen to children and understand their fears and concerns. Or what they don't say. “It has been our mission to share Alfie's story with our entire workforce to highlight the importance of this and how vital it is we get it right. We must put safeguards in place to make sure no child ever suffers like that again. “It is with the greatest sadness we will never be able to undo the dreadful abuse Alfie suffered and our thoughts remain with his family, friends and loved ones.”"

d60f637722ce275c0ca51a893af26ffb,2025-06-24 12:32:00,en,WEB,"  A police force which was repeatedly in contact with the killers of a nine-year-old boy who was assaulted, beaten and murdered in the family home did not sufficiently train officers to identify child abuse, a watchdog has found. Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice.

Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. Nine-year-old Alfie was covered in bruises (West Mercia Police/PA) A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. Carla Scott was found guilty of her son's manslaughter (West Mercia Police/PA) An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice. On some occasions officers lacked professional curiosity and could have undertaken further inquiries. Dirk Howell was jailed for life with a minimum term of 32 years for Alfie's murder (West Mercia Police/PA) “There was a culture of fear within the household which, when coupled with lockdown, severely reduced Alfie's world. There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. “Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. “In that cruel environment, Alfie appears to have had to adopt extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. “It is reassuring that West Mercia Police have committed to ensuring that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. “We have been advised that since we began our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child.” In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Jones, of West Mercia Police, said: “The loss Alfie's family has experienced is immeasurable and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to those who knew him and will forever miss him. “Alfie died after he was inflicted with indescribable abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner and both are now serving considerable prison sentences for his death. “The death of a child in such horrific circumstances is abhorrent and in the immediate aftermath of Alfie's death we carried out a review.

Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. Nine-year-old Alfie was covered in bruises (West Mercia Police/PA) A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident.

Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice. On some occasions officers lacked professional curiosity and could have undertaken further inquiries. “There was a culture of fear within the household which, when coupled with lockdown, severely reduced Alfie's world. There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. “Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. “In that cruel environment, Alfie appears to have had to adopt extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. “It is reassuring that West Mercia Police have committed to ensuring that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. “We have been advised that since we began our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child.” In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Jones, of West Mercia Police, said: “The loss Alfie's family has experienced is immeasurable and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to those who knew him and will forever miss him. “Alfie died after he was inflicted with indescribable abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner and both are now serving considerable prison sentences for his death. “The death of a child in such horrific circumstances is abhorrent and in the immediate aftermath of Alfie's death we carried out a review. This led to significant changes and training put in place for our frontline officers and staff to ensure the signs of child abuse and vulnerability are fully understood. “To ensure an independent assessment and that appropriate scrutiny was applied, in June 2023, we referred our contact with the family prior to Alfie's death to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. “It is essential we do everything within our powers to keep children safe, and that our communities have faith that we will do everything to keep children safe. There is no doubt protecting children is one of the most important things we do. “Since then, we have extended this training to raise awareness to all officers and staff the importance to capture the voice of the child – using professional curiosity to speak and listen to children and understand their fears and concerns.

ca143c77d19bc0f23c3006e47b657fc9,2025-06-24 12:37:00,en,WEB,"  A police force which was repeatedly in contact with the killers of a nine-year-old boy who was assaulted, beaten and murdered in the family home did not sufficiently train officers to identify child abuse, a watchdog has found. Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance.

On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice. On some occasions officers lacked professional curiosity and could have undertaken further inquiries. “There was a culture of fear within the household which, when coupled with lockdown, severely reduced Alfie's world. There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. “Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. “In that cruel environment, Alfie appears to have had to adopt extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. “It is reassuring that West Mercia Police have committed to ensuring that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. “We have been advised that since we began our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child.” In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Jones, of West Mercia Police, said: “The loss Alfie's family has experienced is immeasurable and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to those who knew him and will forever miss him. “Alfie died after he was inflicted with indescribable abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner and both are now serving considerable prison sentences for his death. “The death of a child in such horrific circumstances is abhorrent and in the immediate aftermath of Alfie's death we carried out a review. This led to significant changes and training put in place for our frontline officers and staff to ensure the signs of child abuse and vulnerability are fully understood. “To ensure an independent assessment and that appropriate scrutiny was applied, in June 2023, we referred our contact with the family prior to Alfie's death to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. “It is essential we do everything within our powers to keep children safe, and that our communities have faith that we will do everything to keep children safe. There is no doubt protecting children is one of the most important things we do. “Since then, we have extended this training to raise awareness to all officers and staff the importance to capture the voice of the child – using professional curiosity to speak and listen to children and understand their fears and concerns. Or what they don't say. “It has been our mission to share Alfie's story with our entire workforce to highlight the importance of this and how vital it is we get it right. We must put safeguards in place to make sure no child ever suffers like that again. “It is with the greatest sadness we will never be able to undo the dreadful abuse Alfie suffered and our thoughts remain with his family, friends and loved ones.”"

bbdd0ee88feec66c646a5d3e63d57ad6,2025-06-24 12:45:00,en,WEB,"  A police force which was repeatedly in contact with the killers of a nine-year-old boy who was assaulted, beaten and murdered in the family home did not sufficiently train officers to identify child abuse, a watchdog has found. Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice. On some occasions officers lacked professional curiosity and could have undertaken further inquiries. “There was a culture of fear within the household which, when coupled with lockdown, severely reduced Alfie's world. There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. “Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. “In that cruel environment, Alfie appears to have had to adopt extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. “It is reassuring that West Mercia Police have committed to ensuring that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. “We have been advised that since we began our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child.” In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Jones, of West Mercia Police, said: “The loss Alfie's family has experienced is immeasurable and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to those who knew him and will forever miss him. “Alfie died after he was inflicted with indescribable abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner and both are now serving considerable prison sentences for his death. “The death of a child in such horrific circumstances is abhorrent and in the immediate aftermath of Alfie's death we carried out a review. This led to significant changes and training put in place for our frontline officers and staff to ensure the signs of child abuse and vulnerability are fully understood. “To ensure an independent assessment and that appropriate scrutiny was applied, in June 2023, we referred our contact with the family prior to Alfie's death to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. “It is essential we do everything within our powers to keep children safe, and that our communities have faith that we will do everything to keep children safe.

Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. Nine-year-old Alfie was covered in bruises (West Mercia Police/PA) A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. Carla Scott was found guilty of her son's manslaughter (West Mercia Police/PA) An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice.

An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. “We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. “In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice. On some occasions officers lacked professional curiosity and could have undertaken further inquiries. “There was a culture of fear within the household which, when coupled with lockdown, severely reduced Alfie's world. There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. “Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. “In that cruel environment, Alfie appears to have had to adopt extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. “It is reassuring that West Mercia Police have committed to ensuring that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. “We have been advised that since we began our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child.” In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Jones, of West Mercia Police, said: “The loss Alfie's family has experienced is immeasurable and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to those who knew him and will forever miss him. “Alfie died after he was inflicted with indescribable abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner and both are now serving considerable prison sentences for his death. “The death of a child in such horrific circumstances is abhorrent and in the immediate aftermath of Alfie's death we carried out a review. This led to significant changes and training put in place for our frontline officers and staff to ensure the signs of child abuse and vulnerability are fully understood. “To ensure an independent assessment and that appropriate scrutiny was applied, in June 2023, we referred our contact with the family prior to Alfie's death to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. “It is essential we do everything within our powers to keep children safe, and that our communities have faith that we will do everything to keep children safe. There is no doubt protecting children is one of the most important things we do. “Since then, we have extended this training to raise awareness to all officers and staff the importance to capture the voice of the child – using professional curiosity to speak and listen to children and understand their fears and concerns. Or what they don't say. “It has been our mission to share Alfie's story with our entire workforce to highlight the importance of this and how vital it is we get it right.

Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”.

Mother Carla Scott, received a 27-year prison term for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023, while her partner, Dirk Howell, is locked away for a minimum of 32 years for the murder. Following the conclusion of the court proceedings, a compulsory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Upon reviewing 20 instances of West Mercia Police dealings with Alfie, his mother, and her partner from March 2018 to February 2021, the watchdog concluded there was ""no indication of misconduct"" by any individual officer. Despite ""significant amount of contact"" with the authorities prior to the young boy's death, a ""climate of fear"" pervaded the household, allegedly causing Alfie to be asleep during police visits, according to the IOPC. Moreover, the IOPC noted that Alfie's voice was ""never heard by police"" as his mother fielded inquiries on his behalf. The investigation revealed that on each visit, a new police officer or PCSO turned up and Alfie was never directly engaged by any officer on his own. Notably, half a year before Alfie's tragic death, a concerned neighbour called the officers because they overheard a man yelling and the sound of someone ""thrashing around in the bath"", alerting them with the words: ""Maybe he's being hit and held under the water"". Following this alarming call, two officers responded to check on Alfie, who appeared asleep in his room. They lacked authority to extricate Howell from the premises despite misgivings and thus informed children's services the subsequent day. A police official suggested random safeguarding visits might help, yet there's no proof these ever occurred, according to the IOPC findings. West Mercia Police have adopted the recommended changes by the watchdog, including incorporating alert markers specifying when a youngster is involved in a child protection plan and refining how they refer cases to children's services. Furthermore, the force has ""trained hundreds more officers"" to give young people a meaningful say, as reported by the IOPC. While the watchdog found no evidence of misconduct, it has encouraged 10 individuals to engage in ""reflective practice"" to contemplate their past interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell offered his reflections, stating: ""First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. ""Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. ""It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance. Many other concerns, not shared with the police, were dealt with at local authority level. ""We found no indication of misconduct by any individual officer, but we recommended that eight police constables and two PCSOs undertake reflective practice to review how they handled interactions concerning Alfie. ""In our view, when called to the home, officers should have found a way to speak to Alfie without other adults being present, in line with best practice. On some occasions officers lacked professional curiosity and could have undertaken further inquiries. ""There was a culture of fear within the household which, when coupled with lockdown, severely reduced Alfie's world. There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. ""Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. ""In that harsh environment, Alfie seems to have been forced into extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. ""It is comforting that West Mercia Police have pledged to ensure that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. ""We have been informed that since we initiated our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child."" Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Jones, of West Mercia Police, stated: ""The loss Alfie's family has experienced is immeasurable and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to those who knew him and will forever miss him. ""Alfie died after he was subjected to unspeakable abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner and both are now serving substantial prison sentences for his death. ""The death of a child in such horrific circumstances is abhorrent and in the immediate aftermath of Alfie's death we carried out a review. This led to significant changes and training put in place for our frontline officers and staff to ensure the signs of child abuse and vulnerability are fully understood. ""To ensure an independent assessment and that appropriate scrutiny was applied, in June 2023, we referred our contact with the family prior to Alfie's death to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. ""It is essential we do everything within our powers to keep children safe, and that our communities have faith that we will do everything to keep children safe. There is no doubt protecting children is one of the most important things we do. ""Since then, we have extended this training to raise awareness to all officers and staff the importance to capture the voice of the child – using professional curiosity to speak and listen to children and understand their fears and concerns. Or what they don't say. ""It has been our mission to share Alfie's story with our entire workforce to highlight the importance of this and how vital it is we get it right. We must put safeguards in place to make sure no child ever suffers like that again. ""It is with the greatest sadness we will never be able to undo the dreadful abuse Alfie suffered and our thoughts remain with his family, friends and loved ones."""

There were few opportunities for Alfie to feel safe enough to make a disclosure to professionals about what was happening within the family home. “Carla Scott contributed greatly by failing to safeguard him and failing to put his safety and wellbeing before her loyalty to her partner. “In that cruel environment, Alfie appears to have had to adopt extreme compliance, evidenced by him being in bed allegedly asleep on many of the occasions the police were called, sometimes within a short time of a reported incident. “It is reassuring that West Mercia Police have committed to ensuring that everyone who works in the force knows Alfie's story. “We have been advised that since we began our investigation, the force has trained hundreds more officers in relation to ensuring that children do have a voice regarding any report about the welfare of a child.” In a statement, Deputy Chief Constable Rachel Jones, of West Mercia Police, said: “The loss Alfie's family has experienced is immeasurable and we continue to extend our deepest condolences to those who knew him and will forever miss him. “Alfie died after he was inflicted with indescribable abuse at the hands of his mother and her partner and both are now serving considerable prison sentences for his death. “The death of a child in such horrific circumstances is abhorrent and in the immediate aftermath of Alfie's death we carried out a review. This led to significant changes and training put in place for our frontline officers and staff to ensure the signs of child abuse and vulnerability are fully understood. “To ensure an independent assessment and that appropriate scrutiny was applied, in June 2023, we referred our contact with the family prior to Alfie's death to the Independent Office for Police Conduct. “It is essential we do everything within our powers to keep children safe, and that our communities have faith that we will do everything to keep children safe. There is no doubt protecting children is one of the most important things we do. “Since then, we have extended this training to raise awareness to all officers and staff the importance to capture the voice of the child – using professional curiosity to speak and listen to children and understand their fears and concerns.

50b7a77b7c7ebf4bd1c31c7f24f6c330,2025-06-24 13:05:00,en,WEB,"  A police force which was repeatedly in contact with the killers of a nine-year-old boy who was assaulted, beaten and murdered in the family home did not sufficiently train officers to identify child abuse, a watchdog has found. Alfie Steele, of Droitwich, Worcestershire, died in February 2021 after months of “indescribable” cruelty in which he suffered 50 injuries all over his body and his head was held underwater in a bath. The boy's mother, Carla Scott, was jailed for 27 years for manslaughter at Coventry Crown Court in June 2023 and her partner, Dirk Howell, is serving at least 32 years for his murder. A mandatory referral was made to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) after the court case finished. The watchdog looked at 20 interactions between West Mercia Police and Alfie, his mother and her partner between March 2018 and February 2021 but found that there was “no indication of misconduct” by any individual officer. There had been a “significant amount of contact” with the force in the years before the youngster died, but the family home had a “climate of fear” which meant Alfie was allegedly asleep during the occasions the police were called to the property, the watchdog said. The IOPC added that Alfie's voice was “never heard by police” because his mother answered questions on his behalf. It found that a different police officer or police community support officer (PCSO) attended on each occasion and Alfie was never spoken to by any officer on his own. On one occasion, six months before Alfie was murdered, a neighbour rang police because they could hear a man shouting and someone “thrashing around in the bath”, and said: “Maybe he's being hit and held under the water”. Two officers checked on Alfie, who appeared to be asleep in his room, after this incident. They did not have police powers to remove Howell from the home despite concerns, so they contacted children's services the next day. An officer recorded that random safeguarding visits would be beneficial, but there is no evidence these took place, the IOPC said. The watchdog said West Mercia Police has implemented its recommendations, such as using warning markers to highlight that a child is part of a child protection plan, and reviewing policies around making referrals to children's services. The force has also “trained hundreds more officers” to ensure children have a voice, the IOPC said. The watchdog found no indication of misconduct but has recommended that 10 individuals should take part in “reflective practice” to review their interactions. IOPC director Derrick Campbell said in a statement: “First and foremost, my thoughts and sympathies remain with Alfie's family and everyone affected by his tragic and shocking death. “Our investigation has been painstakingly thorough, examining hundreds of documents, spanning the years that West Mercia Police had contact with Alfie, his mother and her partner. “It is important to note that in most of the incidents, officers did take some positive action and children's services were appropriately made aware of every single police attendance.

We must put safeguards in place to make sure no child ever suffers like that again. “It is with the greatest sadness we will never be able to undo the dreadful abuse Alfie suffered and our thoughts remain with his family, friends and loved ones.”"

PHOTO BY JESSICA SAGGIO Facebook Twitter WhatsApp SMS Email Print Copy article link Save As I struggled to clip in the last piece of my baby girl's car seat, a bead of sweat dripped down my face. The car was running, but it felt like a million degrees difference between the inside of my vehicle and the raging southern heat outside. Dang it, if I could just … get … this … stupid … thing … to … clip. There. Finally. Why do they make these things so hard to do anyway? All of this, just to go to TJ Maxx, I thought. And better yet, I needed to go to about four more places in this forsaken outdoor shopping center. Four more places I would have to pull her out of the car seat, put her back in the car seat, then drive, park, out again, in again, drive, park, out again … you get the gist. And that doesn't even include the effort to get the stroller out. The stores are too far apart to walk, the parking lots aren't the safest for pedestrians, and I think I would actually melt if I attempted it. “Why did we abandon all of those luxurious indoor shopping malls again?” I thought to myself. Those beautiful, manicured, air-conditioned indoor shopping malls. We abandoned those for this — the Sahara Desert of shopping: The outdoor shopping mall! The bane of my existence with a small child. Why did we do it? And what about those with disabilities? Sorry folks. Hope you like online shopping. Meanwhile, the shells of big beautiful malls litter the land that once were town squares, sort of. Places where people could make a day of shopping, saunter around, grab a snack, see and feel with their own senses the merchandise they would spend their hard-earned money on. Sure, you'd run into half the town and the packs of old ladies gathered to get their daily steps in. But it was an experience. And now, the memory feels but a figment of my imagination. I'd think I was hallucinating, except ghosts like the Northshore Square Mall in Slidell are reminders that those days did, in fact, exist. Guests can peek through the locked mall entrances at one of the two remaining anchor stores. Inside, it looks like a relic, a diorama from times long gone. But we abandoned that for the convenience of buzzing into specific stores at outdoor malls. That, and the emergence of online shopping, took over the scene — whether we liked it or not. The malls of the past are now either being bulldozed, repurposed or just sitting stagnant, frozen in time. For Northshore Square specifically, plans to revitalize it have been a talking point for years, but not much has changed. The owners are a Canadian-based company that manages another $17 billion of real estate across the country. City officials have pushed for change, and this year, the city is partnering with St. Tammany development leaders to do a feasibility study and see what the local market could support. Ideas being thrown around include making it a data center, an entertainment venue or having the city purchase it, said Chris Masingill, leader of the St. Tammany Corp., the parish economic development agency. Cool, a data center. What dreams are made of. But how did we get to this point in the first place? Oh right, money. Duh. Isn't it always money? “Open air” shopping centers are notably cheaper to operate, have increased visibility for stores and are better suited for online pickups. In Slidell, Fremaux Towne Center is the Northshore Square's replacement — and it's great. Stores abound. But for a mom with kids, braving the heat — or storms — feels like a lot when you just want some hand soaps from Bath & Body Works and a dose of retail therapy. I find myself lamenting for the days of old, and I'm not the only one. I saw a post about the Northshore Square on a Slidell Facebook group, and 361 comments later, and I can say confidently others share the sentiment. My kids are entranced by a “real mall.”..."

Across the river in Haddon Heights, New Jersey, Katie Repko brings in about $500 to $700 a month while taking care of a newborn. In Philadelphia's Far Northeast, Kristin Doll made $75 in minutes — with just a photo of a discontinued “Aquamarine” Bath & Body Works lotion and a few clicks. These Philly-area residents have found success with an often-hit-or-miss side hustle: selling stuff online. “My best week was probably around $400, while working full-time,” said Tate, 34. She is now scaling back her nannying career to focus on building her Closet Happy Hour social media pages into a full-blown online business. On the secondhand market, Tate said, “there is money to be made, and I love it.” As persistent inflation has tightened household budgets, more U.S. consumers have taken on side hustles in recent years. Reselling clothing, accessories, furniture, home decor, and other items can be an appealing way to bring in extra cash. It can be done from home, and many resale websites and apps now assist with the process, though some take a cut of sellers' revenue. Analysts expect the secondhand market to grow even more in the coming years. High demand for secondhand Successful resellers say the gig requires time, effort and patience but can pay off, now more than ever. Repko, a 36-year-old who has been reselling since college, said demand recently exploded, driven by Gen Z and millennial consumers who want to save money and reduce waste. “Why spend $300 on something when you can spend $50 on it after somebody wore it once?” Repko said, describing the mindset of secondhand-market devotees, including her Retail Rescue Consignment followers. Across seven platforms, Repko currently has about 3,000 listings — mostly women's clothing, accessories, and shoes. Local customers can try on items at her home before they purchase. Repko has become so skilled at reselling that her friends, relatives, and neighbors now enlist her to sell their unwanted items, letting her keep a cut of the sale. Repko said she is currently selling for 36 other people. Drew Lazor also sells for friends and family. The 41-year-old Philadelphia freelance writer turned his pandemic sneaker-resale hobby into an online consignment shop for things people in his life would otherwise throw away. “If I have a T-shirt that I don't want, I sell it to someone else. I make a little bit of money. I declutter my house, and it doesn't go into a landfill,” Lazor said. “That's a win across the board.” Struggles of the resale market For every online-marketplace success story, there are countless tales of people who post items and get few takers. Some also deal with sophisticated scammers, including those who use AI chatbots. As an apartment dweller in Media, Pennsylvania, Chelsea Williams said, she wishes she could sell home decor, clothes and shoes at a neighborhood yard sale, instead of dealing with the back-and-forth of Facebook Marketplace. She has made about $200 selling furniture and home decor there, she said, and no more than $50 selling clothes. “You have to stage the clothing,” said the 35-year-old, who works in accounting. Household items, on the other hand, can be easier to sell with “just a picture of a box saying 'coffee maker.' ” In Philadelphia's Northern Liberties, Julia Duong recently made $60 selling an Instant Pot on Facebook Marketplace that she bought for $100, then barely used. When it comes to clothes, she often ends up just giving them away. Regular resellers said they have learned to be patient, keep posting items, and utilize multiple platforms. At the right price, “everything sells eventually,” said Alexandra Yeganeh, a 34-year-old stay-at-home mom in Philadelphia, who has sold thousands of items. “Some things sell in the same day. … Some things sit for years.” How to make money selling online Successful resellers say confidence and persistence are key. “Setting up the infrastructure to do it is very tedious. It takes a while to get momentum and get rolling,” said Lazor, who would recommend starting on “tried and true” eBay due to its ease of use and number of shoppers. “There is definitely no reason to be intimidated,” said Doll, a 38-year-old dental assistant, who made about $1,000 in a few months selling clothes, home decor, and skincare items on Poshmark and Mercari. “You can put things up. You can delete them. You can relist things. You have nothing to lose.”..."

Here's to having a Tomato Girl Summer, even if you're plucking cans of San Marzano tomatoes off the grocery store shelf. I received this upon its release and have (seriously) considered buying 4–5 more bottles because I'm afraid B&BW will discontinue it. It's SO delectable but as someone who likes some gourmand scents, but not all, I wouldn't quite lump it in with those.

mzqm4og,2025-06-25 18:03:43,en,REDDIT,"  Haven't heard of ashwaghanda for sleep, more like magnesium glycinate. You should wear a body powder when you're sweating and actually being in the sun is not great for us. Heat is an exacerbator. Your body doesn't seem to absorb or metabolize...anything. So I think (not a doctor) that is where you need to start because of course medicinal therapies won't work if your body doesn't metabolize things. That could be because of your thyroid or your hormones (things that can also increase flares). Not eating isn't going to help. Fasting isn't helping if it comes back when your fast is over. No and low carb are not things that have ever been suggested to me. Just dairy, nightshades, sugar, and tobacco. And sometimes...as much as ppl don't want to hear it...sometimes it's just the phase of life you're in and you gotta go thru it to get through it. There have been times my HS was resistant to things and then a year later that treatment works perfectly. Same with my eczema. Some more experimental things you can try before starving yourself include: - laser hair treatment. Some ppl even believe doing it in places without hair will help shrink the pores. - body powder, everywhere - stay out of the heat - take a bath 1x a week with a full tub and a quarter cup of bleach. - try a different biologic - magic healer salve (it's on amazon) - essential oils (tea tree is king) There is at least one thread if not multiple of strange things ppl have done to help themselves when it seems nothing is working. I'd encourage you to explore that over disordered eating."

"" Yuki Sarutobi asked the two, enjoying their meal. She gracefully interrupted their exchange.

After a series of polite pleasantries regarding the day, Yuki asked, ""How is your work progressing? Have any of the unusual experiments you have been carrying out in the temporary laboratory you set up in the library produced any encouraging findings?” Ryu mumbled, ""Ahh,"" as he chewed his food. “We have completed our preliminary work. Tomorrow, we may verify the results. It might save lives if it works."" Yuki leaned forward, intrigued. ""Save lives, you say? That's quite a claim, Ryu. Can you elaborate without compromising your research?"" Ryu hesitated, choosing his words carefully, and said, ""Let's just say we're exploring new frontiers in combating infections. Even though the project is in the initial stage, there is a lot of potential in our work."" Yuki smiled at his response and then continued, ""Speaking of work, I can't help but overhear whispers about the unconventional diagnosis you made the other day right here in this cafeteria. It's causing quite a stir among the staff and patrons, including myself."" Ryu's expression changed a little, showing a hint of surprise mixed with modesty. He said, ""Oh, that. It was merely an observation that caught my attention, and I shared it with that person.” Yuki countered his modesty with a reassuring smile and said, ""Observations others failed to make, surpassing even the skills of professional doctors in numerous hospitals."" After a pause, she continued, ""Well, it appears your 'observations' are gaining quite a reputation around here; it's the talk of the town. about how you diagnosed Mr. Hashimoto. The man who stumped every department?"" Surprise flickered across Ryu's face. ""News travels fast, huh?"" he commented with a hint of amusement. Ryu said, ""I did not mean to cause such a stir. I just wanted to help."" ""And help you did,"" Yuki confirmed, ""but it has caused a lot of people to take notice, Ryu. Everyone wants to know more about you. Yuki found herself lost in thought as she tried to shake off the weight of the conversation she had with Hiruzen earlier that day. But as she shifted her focus to Ryu, a newfound sense of intrigue sparked within her. She was seeing Ryu in a new light. She was earlier sceptical of how Ryu would be able to treat himself, which even she, as a professional doctor, has failed. But now she was trusting him a little.

mov_43FE67B42637BF1B86DB1C2BAAA68687,2025-06-26 18:30:07,en,WEB,"  NEW YORK, June 26 (UPI) --Carry-On, Kingsman and Rocketman actor Taron Egerton says the character he plays in the new Apple TV+ drama Smoke is not a likable hero, but he was intriguing to play. Spoilers ahead. Inspired by the true-crime podcast Firebug, and created by best-selling novelist Dennis Lehane, the limited series premieres Friday. It follows Egerton's Dave Gudsen, a Pacific Northwest arson investigator, aspiring writer and serial fire-starter. ""To a certain extent, you can't get into his head,"" Egerton, 35, told UPI in a recent Zoom interview. ""The thing about Dave is Dave is not really in his head,"" he said. ""A normal person does things and they might have the self-awareness and healthy relationship with themselves to go: 'OK, so why did I do that?' and, 'Was that necessarily the best choice?' and, 'How would I do that differently next time?' ""Dave has none of that. He just is not able to be in any way self-analytical, self-critical. He's not really able to reflect on himself in any way and, although that is horribly unhealthy, it's a really, really fascinating part to play."" The character does not play by the rules of civilized society and betrays the trust his colleagues and the public have placed in him, according to the actor. ""You start to realize there's a weird, twisted freedom in it that comes at a price,"" Egerton noted. To prepare for the role, Egerton listened to Firebug -- the podcast about real-life, California fire captain-turned-serial arsonist and mass murderer John Leonard Orr -- multiple times to understand how the inspiration for his fictional character got away with his crimes for so long. ""It's really useful. It doesn't necessarily give that much insight into why John Orr did the things he did or why Dave Gudsen does the things he does,"" Egerton said. ""Part of why we are fascinated by people who are on the fringe and do very strange things is because we can't really know why,"" he added. ""My instinct is that it's to do with a lack of relationship with himself and a really unhealthy way of coping with things that are difficult to process."" Major red flags in Dave's behavior include his unwillingness to attend events celebrating the accomplishments of his colleagues and his condescending demeanor toward the women in his life, including his police investigation partner, Michell Calderon (Jurnee Smollett), and his wife Ashley (Hannah Emily Anderson). ""Dave is old school in a really awful, toxic way,"" Egerton said. ""He also has a kind of unhealthy relationship with power and control."" Negative interactions with his mother when he was a boy skewed his opinion of women throughout his life. ""He has a kind of contempt for women on some level and I think you can really see that in in some of his encounters in the show,"" Egerton said. ""He's a very, very damaged, very poisonous man."" Smoke marks Egerton's second project with Lehane after 2022's Black Bird, another Apple TV+ miniseries. ""I'm a fan of Dennis' and I think I admire his ability to marry really astute character observation and his incredible intuition about what makes people tick... with really propulsive, compelling storytelling,"" Egerton said. ""I find that very, very exciting,"" he added. ""Crudely put, my litmus test for whether I should be doing something creatively is, 'Do I compulsively want to read this?' and, 'Is this something that I would watch and something that I would be compelled to give hours of my life to?' And I always feel that way about Dennis' work."" The cast of Smoke also includes Greg Kinnear, Rafe Spall, John Leguizamo, Anna Chlumsky and Ntare Mwine. 2025 United Press International, Inc.

Just because I'm a senior citizen I think she figured I wouldnt know she took it. I reported it to the front desk and I only hope they checked the security camera, saw what she did and then fired her. Also when I realized it was gone she had her back to me and she moved to the middle of the floor thinking I wouldn't notice. I haven't been shopping there since!"
1llh75i,2025-06-27 01:14:23,en,REDDIT,"  You snap up in bed, the sound of creaking and crashing snatches you from sleep. You look around you and all looks normal except for the strange purple hue to everything. A bright, almost ultraviolet light has swallowed the entire city. Peering down the street and out across the skyline you really don't see anything different. Some trees sway pretty heavily in the distance. Squinting your eyes you can make out some type of shadow looming on the horizon. As the shadows begin to grow you notice tree rock harder and so do the telephone poles. The buildings too appear to start to sway as the outline takes form. A scuffed white sneaker comes into view, the airfares fabric clear towering over the distant buildings. OOOH SHITTTTTT echos through the early morning silence. The gigantic shoe retreats a step. It's gargantuan form still looming over the city skyline. DAMN THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN BAD, WHAT IS THAT? ARE THOSE ANTS? OH FUCK THATS GROSS. She tilts and you watch helplessly as the outer edge of the city is hit by a tsunami wave of water as the being pours its water out. UHHHH WHY DOES THAT LOOK LIKE THE BANK? A creak and groan of popping joints rings out as the woman leans in to inspect the wet destruction. Suddenly a pen tip the size of a passenger jet bears down. The pen tip dragging through the wet debris, its hole clogging with bits of building, sidewalk, and greenery. She creates a slurry of devastation with her mindless stirring. It isn't until people begin running to help those caught in the chaos, that she seems to snap to focus. SO WHAT ARE YOU, TINY PEOPLE? WHERE YOU ALWAYS THIS SMALL? ARE YOU EVEN REAL? She slings her massive bag from her shoulder, the impact creating a quake that shatters many nearby windows. MY BAD, SURE IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK FOR YOUR LITTLE HANDS. She laughs, the gust carrying the scent of red bull and chewing gum. She removes something from the bag and in a flash a neon green post it note is scooping the bystanders from their feet. She lifts them to eye level. The crack of her gum is deafening, OH SHIT YOU ARE REAL TINY PEOPLE. BRITTANY WILL NEVER BELIEVE THIS and with that the people are dumped into her pocket. Their screams are dampened by the fabric of her jeans as she bends down to inspect more. She scoops a handful of buildings running her thumb over them in her hand. She sifts them like sand at the beach, granules of what were once residential apartments sprinkle down soundlessly. SO FLIMSY, THERE IS NO WAY YALL COULD SURVIVE FOR LONG, I'VE SEEN STURDIER CARDBOARD THAN THIS. As she leans in for a second swipe the streets begin to crack under her weight, EVEN THE ROADS ARE PUNY! IS ANYTHING HERE NOT PATHETICALLY FRAGILE, the sound of cards crunching rings out as she steps forward loosing her balance. WELL NOW LOOK AT WHAT YOU MADE ME DO. The form moves and sways as it removes its shoes, tossing them behind them causing another earthquake, the buildings swaying and few collapsing in the effort. I DIDNT EVEN AIM FOR YALL AND STILL BROKE SOMETHING. She laughs again spit raining from her mouth as more windows shatter with the force of her laugh. Her bare toes squelch in the left over water from earlier as she swipes another handful of buildings, this time lifting them eye level to inspect. The people inside the building scramble out in all directions. She laughs as they trip and fall over the wrinkles of her palm, SO EASILY CONFUSED FOR ANTS, ARENT YOU EMBARRASSED TO BE SO INSIGNIFICANT? I COULD DESTROY YOU WITHOUT EVEN PUTTING IN EFFORT. Just like that she closes her hand and crushes them, turning her hand over and dusting them off. She leaves in again, the smell of her wet bare feet wafts on the breeze she begins to tiptoe through the center of the town. Her heels dipping down and taking out several blocks. The smoke and ash of the crushed cars and powerlines broken surround her feet, the menacing means of her destruction become shrouded...."
n02teuf,2025-06-27 15:13:12,en,REDDIT,"  Honestly, I am new to the world of Arabian perfume. And let me tell you... LIFE ALTERING. I am not even being dramatic. The number of people who have stopped me to tell me I smell amazing is wild. I have been buying anything Lataffa (Khamara is my fav), and Maison D'Orient perfume oils. Right now, I am using MO intense vanilla and Khamara together. With a spritz of sparkly Bath and Body Works Vanilla Brown sugar glitter spray. My scent trail is wonderful, and does not overpower (it could be, but use the perfume sparingly). I have been a Tom Ford Vanille Fatale girlie for almost 10 years, but they changed the formula, and it's now over 600$ a bottle(with a VERY disappointing scent). No thanks. I know nothing about the specific scent you have mentioned, but these brands sell on Amazon for a really decent price, and you can experiment with different ones. Perfume is fun, but does smell different on each persons PH and chemical make up. I wish you the best, and enjoy your foray into the wonderful world of Arabian perfume companies❤"

Wnd while cliche gifts are fun, it's about time to get something they actually appreciate and will use. So let's forget about the ""happy birthday"" mugs, there are lots more to choose from, whether it's clothing, grooming or audio products. Skincare brand Elemis has partnered with the Aston Marin F1 team to launch a limited grooming collection, while Debenhams has dropped the price of a stylish wristwatch by 91% that can be dressed up or down for any occasion. For any beer fans, we've even found a pair of stylish flip flops with a hidden bottle opener - making quite the party piece at any summer barbecue. Below are some of our favourite items for birthday ideas. Next The Spoiled Him Grooming Box - £22, worth £88 High street retailer Next has curated an edit of hair, face and body essentials to treat your dad a well-earned pampering. Priced at £22, the box includes seven items from brands like Bath and Body Works, Rituals, Aromatherapy Associates and more - they are designed to de-stress and refresh skin for an energising pick-me-up. Start the day with Rituals' Homme Charcoal Scrub to remove dirt and dull skin before nourishing the skin using Age Defence Serum from Percy Nobleman to hydrate and protect skin against environmental aggressors. The Mo Bro Cherry Beard Balm is formulated to tame, control, and hydrate the mane, while Percy & Reed's Session Styling Define & Hold Finishing Cream works to smooth strands, define styles and control hair. There's also a Bath & Body Works 3-in-1 wash and a hand soap as well as a De-Stress Muscle Gel from Aromatherapy Associates to recover sore muscles. The items in the box are worth more than £88, according to Next. Other than Next, Liberty's His Essentials Edit, £76.50, includes a printed wash bag with eight products including MALIN+GOETZ Grapefruit Face Cleanser, Sunday Riley Good Genes Lactic Acid Treatment (worth £50), fragrances from Maya Njie and Liberty. Your giftee will receive products worth more than £360. Reef Fanning Sandals (with built-in bottle opener) - £55 Beer-loving men will get the best of both worlds - a pair of new sandals just in time for summer and a bottle opener to crack open a cold one on a laid-back weekend. The Reef Fanning sandals were invented by three-time world surf champion Mick Fanning, and this year, they are celebrating their 20-year anniversary. Featuring high-rebound EVA on the footbed with a built-in airbag for added comfort, the sandals, which comes in various colours, has a mix of premium strap materials with a soft padded jersey lining. Your gifte can rock a pair of  Fanning sandals for beach days, boat trips and chilling in the garden. Should they be thirsty for a cold beer or fizz, they can take off their sandals, use the built-in bottle opener on the outsole, and quench themselves in no time - quite the party trick. But it's debatable for some as shoppers might find it ""unhygienic"" to use. If your giftee loves a ""charm"" instead, then Croc's Classic Slide is a fun gifting option. Currently reduced to £20.99, the slides can hold up to 22 Jibbitz charms. The slides are light and fun, which is great for pool side and for summer walk, the deep cupped Croslite foam footbeds are made for lasting comfort. Neal's Yard Remedies Complete Grooming Kit - £65 Shoppers have praised natural beauty brand Neal's Yard Remedies for making their partner's skin look good and smell great.

It includes the Purifying Face Wash, which has amassed a high 4.46 out of five on reviews, with one sharing: ""My skin feels fresh and clean and never feels dry like when I have used soap and gels before, smells nice and pump dispenser delivers the right amount to wash my face and neck it's great."" The lavender scent delivers a 'calming and spa-like' sensation, and it does not irritate sensitive skin. For the final step, moisturise the skin with Rejuvenating Moisturiser For Men, worth £35 alone, an everyday face cream with an organic blend of conditioning almond, softening jojoba, and antioxidant-rich green coffee. For tired skin, the Age-Defying Moisturiser, £45 is recommended. It features a plant-based 3-peptide complex that is ""specifically chosen to work with male skin"" to target loss of firmness, expression lines and dark circles. Clinique For Men Starter Kit is a great option for an under £20 gift. The three-piece travel set includes a face wash, shaving cream and a face gel - delivering intense hydration for those with extra dry skin. One shopper said: ""Fantastic gift for my partner - he really enjoyed it."" Marshall Emberton III Portable Speaker - £149.99 Whether they listen to podcasts while cooking or enjoy listening to music in the house, Marshall's bluetooth speaker Emberton III is a lightweight portable mini boom box that is dust- and water-proof. Upgraded from Emberton II, the latest addition has an extended playtime of up to 32 hours and it returns to full charge in two hours.

mov_8C14F7B4BAC33F78F152C2F7E565C450,2025-06-28 14:04:48,en,WEB,"  Since 2018, when James Scott Byrnside's Goodnight Irene debuted in all its self-published glory, I've had an image of the author sitting in his bathtub in the luxury penthouse he owns atop one of Las Vegas' swanky off-the-Strip hotels – maybe around City Center? – with classic Sinatra piped in through the sound system. His typewriter on a tray before him, a Scotch in one hand, the butt of a cigar in his mouth, and lots and lots of lavender-scented bubbles all around, the author hunts and pecks until the job is done. Burnside at his ba - no, wait! That's Dalton Trumbo! Seven years later, Byrnside's got five impossible crime novels to his credit - plus, I would imagine, ten very pruney fingers! His books are insanely clever, clearly derived from the Golden Age authors he loves, along with a strong dash of classic pulp fiction. Byrnside likes to dazzle you with baffling puzzles and shock you with sudden bursts of gross violence. He can write an action scene that viscerally places you on the scene – I'm thinking of the flood in Irene and the “buried alive” section of The Strange Case of the Barrington Hills Vampire. And I can't forget the moment in The Five False Suicides when a person's face melts off in a forest fire. (I try to forget, but I can't.) If I could ask Byrnside for two things, it would be to hire a proofreader and a marketing assistant. I had no idea that a new book was in the offing until I happened upon a review at my friend John Harrison's blog. But now that book, It's About Impossible Crime, is in my hands. It's a long-promised collection of short fiction featuring Byrnside's series detective Rowan “The Fat Man” Manory and his handsome assistant, Walter “Hey Good Lookin'” Williams. Manory set his shingle in Chicago during the Roaring Twenties and Dirty Thirties, and brilliant though he may be at solving impossible crimes, his best action was to hire Walter to be his sidekick. Together they're hilarious! (Byrnside once made the terrible mistake of splitting this pair up. He has since rectified that error, all while serving notice that in a James Scott Byrnside story, anything can happen!) It's About Impossible Crime contains five cases, all taking place in the space of a year: 1928, to be exact. To begin, he gives us “Silent Steps of Murder,” Byrnside's take on the old “footsteps in the snow” gimmick. It's New Year's Eve, and Manory and Williams are in a shabby part of town to finish up a case before they celebrate at their favorite bar. Thoughts of “Auld Lang Syne” will have to wait, however, when cries of “murder!” fill the street. The team meets rookie beat cop Jimmy Quinn, who tells them he has discovered the badly mangled body of a woman in her apartment. Veronica Hart, a burlesque dancer, has been shot in the chest, her beauty marred by several stab wounds in the face (lots of tomato sauce!) . The only footprints visible are Quinn's, going in and coming out of Veronica's building. (Byrnside provides us with a nice map here.) Before readers can come up with the obvious theory, Manory assures us we are wrong and then proceeds to give us the truth, based upon logical deductions from the footprints, the body, and a variety of clues found in Veronica's place. This has all the makings of a short-short story: set the scene and explain it away, and do it all through the hilarious rat-a-tat interactions between Manory and Williams. And yet Byrnside does something a little different with the ending of this one that may divide classic mystery readers. I myself really liked that final scene, which gives a clever little puzzle some emotional weight. Byrnside's playfully violent nature rears its head next with “Where There's Smoke, There's Pazuzu.” It's a brisk spring morning, and Manory picks up the phone at work to hear a sinister voice warn him with ghoulish glee that a man is about to be “murdered in the most horrible way imaginable. His body will be torn apart. Then, it will be set on fire. His head will be cut off and his entrails spilled onto the floor. It's going to be a bloody mess.” (Sometimes I think Byrnside should put more lavender in his bath!!) The caller insists Manory must investigate, even though he will not solve the case because the truth involves the supernatural. Naturally, the supernatural is never really involved; rather, some clever killer has come up with a complicated way to make the impossible appear possible. Byrnside throws a lot of information our way about visitors and strange noises and packages and burn patterns . . . and I'm sure it should all come together for people who didn't hate chemistry, which I did, or who have a Rube Goldberg kind of mind – which I don't. Honestly, folks, I rarely try to solve “howdunnits.” For me, it's all about the people, and I'm happy to say that, in that regard, this story does not disappoint. In fact, the high point for me here is when one of the leads takes Williams off to visit an old war buddy and his wife. It's a beautifully written scene that manages to be both witness interview and social commentary, revealing much about the dark side of fighting for your country and the ravages of poverty and illness. In the end, the solution is clever; in fact, with great economy Byrnside gives us a requisite false solution before Manory unveils the real one. And for a puzzle that makes comical hay about the demon Pazuzu, the worst demon there is (just ask Regan MacNeil), this ending packs a real emotional punch. Okay, Byrnside at - oh no!..."

mov_897F9D0F4D3B7E6C855719F8185EBAE6,2025-06-30 02:38:31,en,WEB,"  NEWPORT, RI. - This summer, the Newport Art Museum presents the first museum solo exhibition celebrating the groundbreaking work of Bobby Anspach, emphasizing the late artists unique ability to create a sense of connection and community through his immersive, sculptural installations. The exhibition, titled Everything is Change, features Anspachs Place for Continuous Eye Contact sculptures, known for their transformative use of light and sound, as well as a selection of his other innovative works. This exhibition offers an artists perspective on an artist, shaped by Taylor Baldwin. His approach is deeply personal, informed by his first-hand understanding of Anspachs evolution as his former professor and advisor at Rhode Island School of Design (RISD), as well as his own artistic practice, providing an intimate look into Anspachs work and emphasizing themes of connection, transcendence, and reflection. Everything is Change centers around two of Anspachs signature Place for Continuous Eye Contact sculpturesone designed as a solo experience for deep introspection, and another facilitating a shared experience between two people making eye contact. These works use carefully crafted optical and lighting effects to create an altered perception of space and time, immersing participants in a heightened state of presence. By fostering direct human engagement, these pieces highlight Anspachs belief in connection as a means of healing and transformation. His approach, rooted in DIY aesthetics and high craft, blended common materials with a profound conceptual rigor, creating works that initially appear scrappy and chaotic but ultimately dissolve into seamless, otherworldly environments. Anspachs work underscored the importance of shared experience and human intimacy, aligning powerfully with the Museums historic home setting. Bobby Anspach had an unfailing belief that art was capable of creating a sense of unity, empathy, and understanding in viewers, said Taylor Baldwin, curator of Everything is Change. That is the kind of optimism and faith in creative expression that the art world - and indeed the world beyond it - really needs more of in this exact moment."" Complementing the Place for Continuous Eye Contact sculptures are several works made in concert and conversation with these central pieces. Colorful paintings, preparatory drawings, a stop-motion animation, and surreal sculptures describe Bobby's vision of extravagant sensory experience, productive disorientation, and urgent social imperatives. The exhibition also features a new, ten-minute documentary film from Julia Barrett Mitchell. Debuting as part of Everything is Change, the film uses archival footage to illuminate the life, inspirations, and creative vision of Anspach in his own voice. Additionally, Eluvium, Anspachs longtime collaborator and the composer behind the immersive soundscapes in his Place for Continuous Eye Contact sculptures, served as the sound curator for the exhibition. Eluvium created an ambient soundscape for the relaxation room designed by Lauren Rottet which is an extension of Everything is Change, reinforcing the Anspachs ethos of creative communion and sensory engagement. The room reflects Rottets holistic approach to designone that seamlessly integrates art, architecture, and sensory experience. Influenced by the Light and Space movement, Rottet carefully considers materiality, form, and illumination to craft an environment that transforms with shifting light, offering visitors a space to rest, reflect, and connect before and after experiencing Anspachs work. Featuring pieces from her Rottet Collectionthoughtful products that can stand alone as functional works of artthe room embodies a symphony of design, where every element is composed with intention. Set within the Museums historic John N. A. Griswold Houseone of the first American Stick Style buildings and a National Historic Landmarkthe exhibition underscores the synergy between the Museums architectural heritage and Anspachs focus on human engagement and healing through art. The intimacy of a domestic space provides a compelling backdrop for a body of work centered on connection, reflection, and shared experience. With Everything is Change, the Museum invites visitors to consider how art reflects and reshapes human connection, said Danielle, Artistic Director of the Newport Art Museum. Bringing Bobby Anspachs work into this historic space underscores our mission to explore how contemporary art can spark deeper connections within our community. His work pushes the boundaries between technology and human intimacy, reminding us that even in a digital age, person-to-person connection remains essential and irreplaceable. The Museum will host a dynamic series of programs engaging the community and featuring leading voices across art, design, music, and wellness. Major programs include the events for Newport Design Week, a sound bath performance by Eluvium, and lectures from the exhibitions curator Taylor Baldwin and Dr. Stephanie Hartselle, Clinical Associate Professor of Psychiatry and Human Behavior at Brown University. Bobby Anspach was an American artist whose work centered around the creations of sculptural installations designed to deliver transcendent experiences to viewers, all part of a series titled Place for Continuous Eye Contact. As much a sculptor as an inventor, these devices are currently undergoing a patenting process. Employing a DIY-technique through all of his work, Anspach was focused on creating brilliant, unexpected, and sublime experiences that blend common objects with high craft, ranging from pom-poms to hand-blown glass to medical beds, aiming to inspire viewers to look within and discover everyday beauty and the natural world. These works create an experience that at first appears scrappy and chaotic, and quickly blends into a seamless, all-encompassing, and otherworldly space. His work was informed by a deep respect for the environment and meditation, and founded on a belief of the interconnectedness of all things that was aimed to create a cared experience between all viewers of his work. During his lifetime, Anspachs work was celebrated and exhibited across the United States, most notably at the Spring/Break Art Show, New York, 2018 and 2020, the 2019 BRIC Biennial: Volume III. Brooklyn, NY, and the 2019 Governors Island Art Fair, as well as in numerous gallery exhibitions across Rhode Island, Massachusetts, and California. In the public sphere, he presented his Place for Continuous Eye Contact installations and made them available for visitor experiences at a pop-up space in Beacon, NY in 2021; in a Walmart parking lot in Newburgh, NY in 2022; and on Fifth Avenue outside the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York in 2022. Bobby Anspach was born in 1987 in Toledo, OH, and died in 2022 in Beacon, NY. He received his BA from Boston College in 2011, studied at California College of the Arts in San Francisco, and received an MFA in sculpture from the Rhode Island School of Design in 2017. There, he produced the earliest versions of the Place for Continuous Eye Contact series of sculptural works."

Here's what the experts recommend Overheating is dangerous for dogs and can lead to dehydration, seizures, heatstroke, and in some cases, even death. As the weather gets warmer, it becomes more important than ever to know how to keep them cool and prevent these health conditions from developing. Thousands of dogs die from heatstroke every single year, and a recent study in the UK showed that 75% of cases were caused by exercise, 13% by environmental heat, and 5% by being trapped in hot cars. If you don't have air conditioning at home, it can feel difficult to keep yourself cool – let alone your pets with their furry coats – but we've shared some top tips below that can help, using things you probably already have lying around. How to keep your dog cool Here are six easy ways to keep your dog cool in the summer, recommended by expert vet Dr Joanna Woodnutt: 1. Keep them shaded Some dogs would rather sit in the sun all day than seek out a cool, sheltered spot. However, it's important to keep them in the shade on hot days (even if they'd prefer to sunbathe!) – whether that means putting a canopy over their outdoor bed or putting them inside altogether. Always make sure they're out of direct sunlight. Heeyoo Elevated Dog Bed with Canopy | Amazon This outdoor bed is elevated off the ground to keep your dog cooler, with a detachable canopy to shade them from the sun. It comes in a range of colors and sizes. 2. Give them a cooling mat One of the best ways to help your dog lose heat is by giving them a cool surface to lie on – even better if it's one of the best cooling mats for dogs. Some of these don't even need to be put in the freezer beforehand and contain pressure-activated gel that cools when your dog lies on it. The Green Pet Shop Cool Pet Pad | Amazon This cooling pet pad doesn't require any electricity, water, or refrigeration to stay cold; the gel formula is pressure-activated. It comes in five different sizes and recharges itself after 15 to 20 minutes without use. 3. Hydrate them Keeping your dog hydrated on a hot day could save their life. As a pet parent, I know how hard it can be to encourage a dog to drink more – but things like the best pet water fountains and flavored drops have made it so much easier. Dog Water Fountain | Amazon This fountain can hold up to seven liters of liquid and pumps fresh, clean water out of the nozzle after passing through a filter. It's motion-activated and BPA-free, with a cordless design that looks sleek in your home. 4. Get them wet Getting your dog wet is another great way to cool them down – whether it's playing a game in the sprinkler, gently hosing them down, or setting up one of the best swimming pools for dogs in a shady spot in the garden. Make sure the water reaches right down to their skin, as the evaporation will help cool them.

mov_985A968B8C7CBDDD4E4583FAC0F189D4,2025-06-30 16:08:55,en,WEB,"  A Caltech-led team has developed a safe, effective, and painless breast imaging technique that incorporates machine learning to help differentiate between suspicious and healthy tissue. The method has now been tested on patients and performs as well as or better than other conventional breast imaging techniques. For decades, X-ray mammography has been the gold standard of breast imaging for the early detection of breast cancer. While the technique remains valuable in terms of reducing cancer deaths, it does expose patients to small amounts of ionizing radiation, painfully squeezes breasts to allow X-rays to more easily pass through tissue, and, especially in the case of dense breast tissue, produces many false positive diagnoses. Other techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used for breast imaging, but these also have problems. Ultrasound is very safe, but its accuracy is dependent on the skill of the operator and the results are not always conclusive. MRI is time-intensive, expensive, and cannot be used on patients who are allergic to contrast agents or those who are claustrophobic or have certain implants. ""We were strongly motivated to work on this problem because none of the current techniques are perfect,"" says Lihong Wang , the Bren Professor of Medical Engineering and Electrical Engineering at Caltech. ""The future of medicine has to be better than that."" The technique that Wang and his colleagues have developed and refined over the past 20 years is called photoacoustic computed tomography, or PACT. It offers a breast imaging alternative without the discomfort, high costs, or risk associated with the conventional evaluation methods. PACT features a laser-sonic scanner that can identify tumors in as little as 15 seconds. Working with researchers at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, California, the team has tested PACT on 39 patients. It achieved comparable results to mammography and MRI in terms of differentiating between suspicious and normal tissue as well as malignant and benign growths or lumps. The scientists describe PACT and their clinical results in a new paper in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. The lead authors of the paper are Xin Tong (MS '21), Cindy Z. Liu, and Yilin Luo, graduate students in the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Department of Medical Engineering at Caltech; along with Li Lin (PhD '20), who completed the work while at Caltech and is now at Zhejiang University in China. ""This is the culmination of literally decades of work,"" says Wang, who is also the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Medical Engineering Leadership Chair and executive officer for medical engineering at Caltech. ""We'd like to make PACT a clinical tool that benefits patients-to help detect breast cancer without patients taking the risk of getting cancer or worrying about an allergic reaction."" How It Works PACT works by shining a near-infrared laser pulse into the breast tissue. The laser light diffuses through the breast and is absorbed by molecules. For example, it can be absorbed by oxygen-carrying hemoglobin molecules in the patient's red blood cells, causing the molecules to vibrate ultrasonically. Unlike X-rays, which travel in a straight line, light waves scatter, or bounce around inside tissues, making it difficult to get high-resolution images. So PACT combines light and sound into a single modality. ""We use light to see the molecules, but we use sound to define the spatial location,"" Wang says. The vibrations from the molecules travel through the tissue and are picked up by an array of 512 tiny ultrasonic sensors placed over the skin of the breast. Data from those sensors are used to assemble an image of the breast's internal structures in a process that is similar to ultrasound imaging, though much more precise. PACT can provide a clear view of structures as small as a quarter of a millimeter at a depth of 4 centimeters. ""We basically use molecules to figure out the body's physiology,"" Wang says. ""That's the beauty of photoacoustic tomography: By detecting molecules, we can figure out exactly how the body is functioning. When there's a functional difference, that means we can potentially detect disease better."" For example, PACT is excellent at detecting hemoglobin and therefore revealing angiogenesis, a common signature of breast cancer that involves the growth of additional blood vessels to deliver more nutrient-rich blood to cancerous cells. PACT can also detect tumor hypoxia, another signature of cancer, where fast metabolism outstrips the blood supply, leaving parts of the tumor starved of oxygen. Machine Learning Can Detect Suspicious Tissue, Sometimes Before Humans Can With the maturity of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, Wang says PACT has become better at detecting abnormalities in breast tissue than it was a few years ago. The scientists trained the system on images of malignant and benign growths or lumps as well as suspicious and healthy tissue, improving its ability to notice subtle variations that indicate what type of tissue has been imaged. Indeed, Wang says, PACT can often detect problematic features that would likely go unnoticed by the human eye. The Patient Experience During a PACT scan, the patient lies face down on a table with a recess containing a warm water bath, ultrasonic sensors, and the laser. One breast at a time is placed in the recess, and the laser shines into it from below. Because the technique is rapid, each scan can be accomplished while the patient holds their breath. ""We started with a basic lab system-just a single-element ultrasound transducer that we rotated around-and it took forever. Now we can do 3D imaging during a single breath, making it very practical,"" Wang says. Wang adds that in some ways, the new work is just the beginning, as the team believes it will be able to further enhance the technique's imaging quality by adding additional laser wavelengths to the two they currently use and improving additional features. Looking to the future, the team's next steps include acquiring a larger dataset from additional breast cancer volunteers, improving the classification model by leveraging more features, and eventually commercializing the technology. The paper is titled ""Panoramic photoacoustic computed tomography with learning-based classification enhances breast lesion characterization."" Additional authors are Peng Hu (PhD '23) and Caltech graduate student Junfu Zheng; former Wang lab members Yide Zhang and Rui Cao; and Jessica Dzubnar, Marta Invernizzi, Stephanie Delos Santos, Jaclene Torres, Armine Kasabyan, Lily Lai, and Lisa D.

Warm bath (5–10 minutes) * Lowers core body temperature slightly — this mimics the natural cooling that occurs before sleep. * Sensory signal that the day is ending. 2. Pajamas + Diaper Change * Soft, breathable materials * Keep the room warm and the lighting dim — avoid overhead lights 3. Feeding (if age-appropriate) * Calm, distraction-free feeding helps top them off for the night. * Avoid letting them fall fully asleep at the bottle or breast if you're promoting independent sleep. 4. Calm cuddle or storytime * Cuddling helps release oxytocin (the bonding hormone) which soothes both baby and parent. * Reading even just one short board book builds language development. 5. Turn on white noise * Consistent ambient noise blocks out household sounds and creates a sleep association cue. * Bonus: mimics the womb environment. 6. Lay baby down drowsy but awake * This is key for teaching independent sleep. * It helps them learn how to fall asleep on their own, making it easier to self-soothe during nighttime wakeups. Pro Parent Tips: * 📆 Stick with it for at least 2 weeks. Habits take time to stick, but the payoff is long-term. * 💡 Keep it simple. No need for a long list of steps. Just 3–5 calming, repeatable actions. * 🗣️ Use the same language every night, like “Okay, time to say goodnight!” — your baby will begin to anticipate what comes next. * 🔁 Consistency is more important than perfection. Even if bedtime shifts a bit, keep the routine steps the same. Find us now on Amazon.

1lorvnl,2025-07-01 03:48:24,en,REDDIT,"  Hello, I'm a 30-year-old woman and I am very interested in working in law enforcement, but I've made some bad decisions in my past. I'm wondering if I have any chance of becoming an officer, or if my history would make that impossible. I know it's a lot, but I was hoping there might still be a chance since I can show that I've changed and grown from my past. Here's what I've done (I'm not proud of any of it): * Grew and ate magic mushrooms a couple of times around age 15. * Trespassed in an abandoned daycare/church and an abandoned school around age 15. * Stole candy from a gas station when I was about 15. * Grew weed for personal use when I was about 17. * Have $20k in unpaid credit card debt from a failed business between ages 18–22. It has dropped off my credit report, but I still plan to repay it if my income allows. * Engaged in prostitution when I was 21 due to desperation and nearly being homeless. This is something I deeply regret. * Returned items worth around $30 to Amazon claiming they were defective when they weren't (around age 21). * Stole a $30 temperature gun from my work as a cashier around age 21 (impulsive decision, also deeply regret). * Smoked meth one time around age 25. My brother, who I looked up to at the time, pressured me to try it. I have completely cut him and other negative influences out of my life for years now. * I am prescribed Ritalin for ADHD, which I have taken legally since around age 25. * I do not have a strong work history. I've done things like selling items online, starting a bath and body business that eventually failed, tried an Airbnb rental business that failed, worked as a cashier, and worked as a bartender from around ages 18–24. After that, I followed my spouse's career while we moved frequently. I became a homemaker and raised our son while attending university and studying the local language. I also got certified to teach English and taught online part-time for a while. I recently graduated and am looking to start a stable career now. Here are some positive things I'm hoping might offset my past: * Never been arrested, never charged with anything. Completely clean legal and driving record. * Recently completed a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with a concentration in Project Management, with a 3.7 GPA. First-generation college graduate. * Got a Thai language education visa and traveled to Thailand to study Thai when I was around 25. I am now bilingual. This was around the time I really started turning my life around. * I am currently enrolled in an intensive Muay Thai training program in Thailand, which I will finish in six months. After that, I plan to return to the U.S. and start the application process for law enforcement. I am open to relocating anywhere in the U.S. (my spouse works remotely). * I have been clean from all illegal drugs and illegal or unethical activity for at least five years. I do still drink socially and have used marijuana socially in places where it is legal, but I have recently quit marijuana since I know it is not compatible with a career in law enforcement. I understand the severity of some of these things, but I am not the same person I used to be. I was wondering if there is any realistic chance that I could work in law enforcement. I've learned from my mistakes and I genuinely want to do something meaningful with my life. I know a lot of departments are short-staffed right now and are hiring, but I also fully understand why LE would be hesitant to hire someone with my background. I would be very grateful for any honest feedback, especially from someone who knows the background process."

Other techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used for breast imaging, but these also have problems. Ultrasound is very safe, but its accuracy is dependent on the skill of the operator and the results are not always conclusive. MRI is time-intensive, expensive, and cannot be used on patients who are allergic to contrast agents or those who are claustrophobic or have certain implants. The technique that Wang and his colleagues have developed and refined over the past 20 years is called photoacoustic computed tomography, or PACT. It offers a breast imaging alternative without the discomfort, high costs, or risk associated with the conventional evaluation methods. PACT features a laser-sonic scanner that can identify tumors in as little as 15 seconds. Working with researchers at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, California, the team has tested PACT on 39 patients. It achieved comparable results to mammography and MRI in terms of differentiating between suspicious and normal tissue as well as malignant and benign growths or lumps. The scientists describe PACT and their clinical results in a new paper in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. The lead authors of the paper are Xin Tong (MS '21), Cindy Z. Liu, and Yilin Luo, graduate students in the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Department of Medical Engineering at Caltech; along with Li Lin (PhD '20), who completed the work while at Caltech and is now at Zhejiang University in China. ""This is the culmination of literally decades of work,"" says Wang, who is also the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Medical Engineering Leadership Chair and executive officer for medical engineering at Caltech. ""We'd like to make PACT a clinical tool that benefits patients-to help detect breast cancer without patients taking the risk of getting cancer or worrying about an allergic reaction."" How it works PACT works by shining a near-infrared laser pulse into the breast tissue. The laser light diffuses through the breast and is absorbed by molecules. For example, it can be absorbed by oxygen-carrying hemoglobin molecules in the patient's red blood cells, causing the molecules to vibrate ultrasonically. Unlike X-rays, which travel in a straight line, light waves scatter, or bounce around inside tissues, making it difficult to get high-resolution images. So PACT combines light and sound into a single modality. ""We use light to see the molecules, but we use sound to define the spatial location,"" Wang says. The vibrations from the molecules travel through the tissue and are picked up by an array of 512 tiny ultrasonic sensors placed over the skin of the breast. Data from those sensors are used to assemble an image of the breast's internal structures in a process that is similar to ultrasound imaging, though much more precise. PACT can provide a clear view of structures as small as a quarter of a millimeter at a depth of 4 centimeters. ""We basically use molecules to figure out the body's physiology,"" Wang says. ""That's the beauty of photoacoustic tomography: By detecting molecules, we can figure out exactly how the body is functioning. When there's a functional difference, that means we can potentially detect disease better."" For example, PACT is excellent at detecting hemoglobin and therefore revealing angiogenesis, a common signature of breast cancer that involves the growth of additional blood vessels to deliver more nutrient-rich blood to cancerous cells. PACT can also detect tumor hypoxia, another signature of cancer, where fast metabolism outstrips the blood supply, leaving parts of the tumor starved of oxygen. Machine learning can detect suspicious tissue, sometimes before humans can With the maturity of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, Wang says PACT has become better at detecting abnormalities in breast tissue than it was a few years ago. The scientists trained the system on images of malignant and benign growths or lumps as well as suspicious and healthy tissue, improving its ability to notice subtle variations that indicate what type of tissue has been imaged. Indeed, Wang says, PACT can often detect problematic features that would likely go unnoticed by the human eye. The patient experience During a PACT scan, the patient lies face down on a table with a recess containing a warm water bath, ultrasonic sensors, and the laser. One breast at a time is placed in the recess, and the laser shines into it from below. Because the technique is rapid, each scan can be accomplished while the patient holds their breath. ""We started with a basic lab system-just a single-element ultrasound transducer that we rotated around-and it took forever. Now we can do 3D imaging during a single breath, making it very practical,"" Wang says. Wang adds that in some ways, the new work is just the beginning, as the team believes it will be able to further enhance the technique's imaging quality by adding additional laser wavelengths to the two they currently use and improving additional features. Looking to the future, the team's next steps include acquiring a larger dataset from additional breast cancer volunteers, improving the classification model by leveraging more features, and eventually commercializing the technology. The paper is titled ""Panoramic photoacoustic computed tomography with learning-based classification enhances breast lesion characterization."" Additional authors are Peng Hu (PhD '23) and Caltech graduate student Junfu Zheng; former Wang lab members Yide Zhang and Rui Cao; and Jessica Dzubnar, Marta Invernizzi, Stephanie Delos Santos, Jaclene Torres, Armine Kasabyan, Lily Lai, and Lisa D.

d95db8fe93a02554c92e205a2f1c763d,2025-07-01 20:28:00,en,WEB,"  US open: Halo-halong simula sa H2 trading habang hinuhukay ng mga mamumuhunan ang mga komento ni Powell Ang mga pangunahing indeks ay naghatid ng magkahalong pagganap noong Martes habang ang mga namumuhunan ay nakatutok sa isang talumpati mula sa chairman ng Federal Reserve na si Jerome Powell. At the close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.91% at 44,494.94, while the S&P 500 lost 0.11% to 6,198.01 and the Nasdaq Composite saw out the session 0.82% softer at 20,202.89. The Dow closed 400.17 points higher on Tuesday, building on gains recorded in the previous session, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite retreated from their recent record highs. Tuesday's primary focus was comments from Powell, with the Fed head revealing that the central bank would have already eased monetary policy by now if not for Donald Trump's tariff so-called ""Liberation Day"" tariffs. ""In effect, we went on hold when we saw the size of the tariffs and essentially all inflation forecasts for the United States went up materially as a consequence of the tariffs,"" said Powell. Powell's comments come just a day after Donald Trump sent him a handwritten note demanding ultra-low interest rates. ""Jerome – Ikaw, gaya ng dati, 'too late.' Nagkakahalaga ka ng USA - at patuloy na gawin ito - dapat mong babaan ang rate - nang malaki!"" sabi ni Trump. ""Daan-daang bilyong dolyar ang nawawala! Walang inflation."" Elsewhere, Elon Musk criticised Trump's megabill, branding it as ""utterly insane and destructive"". However, the bill passed in the Senate on Tuesday in a 51-50 vote and will now move on to the House, which can still reject recent changes to the legislation. Sa harap ng macro, Pandaigdigang S&P's manufacturing PMI rose to 52.9 in June, up from 52 in May and ahead of both a flash estimate of 52 and expectations of 51. Output rose for the first time in four months and at the second-fastest pace since March 2024 amid higher demand for capacity. On the price front, input costs accelerated the most in nearly three years, driving output charges to jump their highest level since September 2022. On another note, the Institute for Supply Management's manufacturing PMI ticked up to 49 in June, up from 48.5 in May and ahead of expectations of 48.8. While economic activity in the manufacturing sector contracted for the fourth consecutive month, the rate of contraction slowed amid a rebound in production and improvements in inventories. Still on data, the US economy created 374,000 jobs in May, according to ang Bureau of Labor Statistics, habang ang mga pagbubukas ng trabaho ay tumaas sa 7.76m, na may pinakamalaking kita na nakikita sa mga serbisyo sa tirahan at pagkain. Sa kabaligtaran, bumaba ng 39,000 ang mga bakanteng trabaho sa pederal na pamahalaan ng US. Sa wakas, ang paggasta sa pagtatayo ng US ay bumaba ng 0.30% buwan-sa-buwan noong Mayo, ayon sa ang Census Bureau, bumababa sa isang seasonally adjusted annualized rate na $2.13trn mula sa binagong 0.4% na pagbaba ng Abril. Sa corporate space, nagbabahagi ng Facebook parent company Mga Meta Platform nakipagkalakalan nang mas mataas matapos ang tech giant ay nagsiwalat ng mga plano para sa isang AI lab na nakatuon sa ""superintelligence"" na magsasama ng mga mananaliksik na na-poach mula sa OpenAI, habang ang electric carmaker Tesla nakipagkalakalan nang mas mababa pagkatapos imungkahi ni Donald Trump iyon ang Department of Government Efficiency dapat tingnan ang mga subsidiya na natanggap ng mga kumpanya sa ilalim ng pamumuno ni Elon Musk.

mov_D539C215683E783F9B5EF46A366C9CE0,2025-07-02 05:09:50,en,WEB,"  A woman who was beaten, burned and starved as a child has said it is never too late to seek justice after her mother was jailed for abusing her more than 50 years ago. Caroline Eshghi said she was subjected to years of ""terror"" by her mother, Melanie Burmingham, while living in Bristol, Somerset, and Wiltshire during the 1970s and 80s. Burmingham, 76, was jailed for 20 months in May after Ms Eshghi, 57, successfully appealed the initial suspended sentence. Now she is campaigning for a change in the law around sentencing guidelines for historical child abuse cases. ""My childhood was definitely stolen from me,"" she told the BBC. ""When you've survived child abuse, it never really goes away."" Warning: This article contains details some readers may find distressing Ms Eshghi, who now lives in Cornwall, grew up at houses in Redland in Bristol, Long Ashton on the outskirts of the city, Midsomer Norton in Somerset and Avebury in Wiltshire before she ran away at the age of 15. One of her earliest memories is being five-years-old and in a house with an L-shaped hallway, where she remembers being ""drop-kicked like a human football"". ""The viciousness of it made me pee blood,"" she said. Ms Eshghi recalls being put in the bath where her mother would hold her head under the water and turn out the lights, and being made to sleep on the floor. ""I used to sleep next to the bed that she was in and randomly through the night she would just lean over while I was sleeping on the floor and punch me, so I would be lying there in terror."" ""I think at the age of nine is when she became an alcoholic and the hell was amplified quite a bit,"" Ms Eshghi added. ""She would smash things, she split my face open with a broken glass butter dish. ""She would tell me to get the walking stick and make me kneel in front of her while she beat me with it and she put out cigarettes on my body."" Ms Eshghi said she would be sent to school unwashed, wearing broken wellington boots, with just a cream cracker in her lunchbox. ""I used to have the nickname Paddington Bear at school,"" she added. ""School dinners were torture for me because I had nothing and I used to watch the other children eating lovely food."" 'Seriously failed' Ms Eshghi said she was ""hugely let down"" by Bristol social services, formerly Avon social services, which she said allowed her to ""slip through the net"" despite referrals from schools she attended. ""The only thing I remember is that a lady used to come and visit and ask 'does your mum hit you?' ""Of course I was going to say no. As soon as she left I was beaten and assaulted."" Ms Eshghi made the decision to report the abuse she suffered to police in 2019. ""I was told on the phone that the records from that time were not looked after as they should have been and were put in a basement that flooded and many were lost,"" she said. Avon and Somerset Police launched an investigation and four years later, in March 2023, Burmingham was charged with one count of cruelty to a person under 16 years contrary to section 1 of the Children and Young Person Act 1933. She was given a 20-month suspended sentence after pleading guilty during trial at Portsmouth Crown Court. In May, Ms Eshghi appealed her mother's suspended sentence. ""I thought that was it, that was done,"" she said. ""But it went straight to the Attorney General who agreed that the sentence was unduly lenient."" The case was escalated to the Court of Appeal and on 23 May, Burmingham was sent to prison for 20 months. Lord Justice Stuart-Smith stated that if he was trying the case now he would be looking at a minimum term of nine years and a maximum of 14 years. Under current laws, judges can only pass a sentence within the maximum term available at the time of the offending but Ms Eshghi has launched a petition calling for this to change. ""The way the law works is that if you are taking a historical case through the judicial system for child abuse, they have to adhere to the sentencing rules of when the abuse took place. ""I would like the law changed so that historical cases will be charged on current sentencing guidelines and not on the guidelines from decades ago."" The Ministry of Justice has been approached for comment. Ms Eshghi said she feels a ""sense of peace"" knowing her mother has been sent to prison. ""When you are abused, it is part of you,"" she said. ""But you heal in such a way that you're not in denial of it. You're not ashamed of it. ""I'm very lucky, I've got wonderful children, I live in a beautiful home in a beautiful part of the world. I am blessed"". Historic files search A spokesperson for Bristol City Council said: ""The events described by Caroline are awful and should never be an environment any child has to experience. ""Whilst we cannot answer for a council and a social services regime that no longer exist, we are pleased to see that Caroline has received some form of justice but recognise that this does not remove the impact of the abuse experienced as a child. ""A search for historic files associated with this case was undertaken following a request received from the police. ""Three separate and extensive searches were undertaken in 2020, 2022 and 2023 but were unable to identify any records that matched the details given by police. ""The protocols often in place over 40 years ago meant that when an individual left the local authority area, their case files were transferred to the council for the area the person moved to. ""Every effort to support the police in their investigations has been taken and should any further support be required we will again fully engage with that process.""

mov_8B2371A78150ABB695F2310A47C1B9E7,2025-07-02 12:19:03,en,WEB,"  Among the most cherished and iconic natural fragrances in the world, rose attar original holds a place of unmatched elegance. Renowned for its rich floral aroma and therapeutic properties, this luxurious attar has been a symbol of love, beauty, and purity for centuries. Crafted from the petals of fresh roses—often the famed Damask or desi gulab varieties—this natural perfume oil is more than just a scent; it is a legacy passed down through generations of perfumers. What sets rose attar original apart from synthetic rose fragrances is its authenticity. It is distilled using age-old traditional methods, often in Kannauj, India—the perfume capital of the country—where natural attar-making techniques are still preserved and honored. Unlike mass-produced rose perfumes, the original version of rose attar contains no alcohol, synthetic chemicals, or artificial preservatives. It is a pure, potent oil that offers a deeper, more complex experience than any laboratory-created scent ever could. The Art of Crafting Rose Attar Original The making of rose attar original is a highly refined and time-intensive process. At its heart is the hydro-distillation method, which captures the essence of thousands of fresh rose petals. Here's how it works: Harvesting the Roses: Only fresh petals are used, often plucked in the early morning when their scent is strongest. Damask roses are preferred due to their deep, spicy, and slightly honeyed aroma. Distillation: The petals are placed in large copper vessels (degs) filled with water. These are heated slowly while the steam carries the rose oil into a separate receiver (bhapka) containing a natural base oil—typically sandalwood. Infusion and Aging: The rose essence infuses into the sandalwood oil, and the attar is aged for several weeks or months to allow the blend to mature and deepen in aroma. The result is a golden or pale amber-hued oil with an intensely rich floral scent—soft yet powerful, romantic yet grounded. Distinguishing Features of Rose Attar Original While there are many rose-based perfumes in the market, identifying rose attar original requires an understanding of its unique qualities: Natural Ingredients: Authentic rose attar uses real rose petals and natural sandalwood oil as a base. It is free from alcohol and synthetic fixatives. Complex Aroma: Unlike one-dimensional synthetic perfumes, rose attar has layers of scent that unfold over time—from the initial burst of freshness to a warm, woody dry-down.

His ruined eye cascaded down his face and Jin-e could hear the pattering sound of his blood dripping onto the floor. These apparitions were not unfamiliar to Jin-e. He had seen them since his mother died. He simply chose to ignore them. He turned his attention back to the woman in his lap. She leaned forward towards him and when he looked at her, he saw that her eyes were both gone: Bloody blank holes. ""Just relax."" She pushed her face so close to his that he could smell the blood on her. He watched the bath water slowly turning red. ""Just relax."" He repeated. He closed his eyes, tensed all the muscles in his body, and then let them go. This always helped for some reason. Plus, he had a perfectly good distraction right in front of him. He opened his eyes and all was as it should be. It wasn't so much that the visions scared him. He had seen so much in his lifetime that those were nothing.

n12uhbq,2025-07-03 05:36:38,en,REDDIT,"  I have recovered from this condition (it took years) and I am now able to actually enjoy flying believe it or not. Here is what worked for me... 1) Exposure therapy - essentially flying alot. By flying repeatedly I built up a backlog of neutral flight experiences. I began to get used to the normal aspects of flying (the boarding and check in process, turbulence,  deplaning, etc). 2) Learning about the science of flight- this helped me catastrophize less about every noise and movement I encounter on a plane. I also learned that choosing seats on the wings meant less feelings of turbulence so I now choose seats that make me feel better. 3) Upgrading- I splurge on creature comforts for myself when I fly. I upgrade to extra leg room seats and early boarding. I let myself eat whatever overpriced bullshit I want at the airport. I got an airline credit card to earn perks when flying with the same airline and I fly direct whenever possible. 4) Medication- I hear you that you have struggled with substances so many meds are not a fit. See if you can get some non habit -forming meds to ease your flight experience. By racking up experiences on planes where you are able to stay calm over time you teach yourself not to freak out. 5) Flight sensory tool kit- I bring items to help myself feel clean. I always bring disinfectant wipes and wipe down my seat, seat belt and window as soon as I board. This makes the plane feel clean and safe. I keep small bottles of hand sanitizer and lotion, face wipes (sometimes a cool wipe on the face is nice if Im having a hard time, can also be used to sponge bath in the restroom during really long international flights). I also bring items that offer different sensory experiences like sour candy, snacks, aromatherapy drops for my wrists, a big light blocking eye mask, quiet fidgets, a refillable water bottle, a tiny stuffed toy, neck pillow, and a big light weight scarf that can act as blanket if needed. Being comfortable is extremely important. 6) Flight playlist- I have two curated playlists (one of Feist and one of Astrud Gilberto, upbeat & calming tracks ONLY) I listen to these on repeat. You'll have to do some reflecting to see what will work for you. 7) Homemade Flashcards- I made a set of flash cards to take with me on a flight... the flashcards have the following things on them...A) Photos of places I dream of visiting some day (Hawaii, Italy, Japan etc), B) images of flying that have a positive association for me (stills of Kiki flying on her broom from kiki's deliver service) C) instructions for breathing and relaxation techniques to counteract panic (like counting backwards from 100, full body scan etc), D) Photos of art works I love (paintings by Odilon Redon). I flip through these as needed when I'm having issues on the flight. 8) The Bag- I bring a lightweight reusable nylon bag (think a baggu nylon bag) and tuck it into the seat pocket under the tray table at my seat. I then put any items I need (wet wipes, fidgets, my water bottle, my flight flash cards) inside the bag. When its time to deplane I grab the bag and go. I dont have to worry about accidentally leaving anything in the seat pocket because its all in the bag. Being prone to anxiety on flights could mean accidentally losing my items on a plane so this technique just gives me one less thing to stress about. Things Ive learned about myself... I love looking out the window on a plane. Even at my most scared I still find looking down and seeing everything miniaturized super cool. I love seeing cloud formations up close and Ive learned the big puffy clouds that I love looking at tend to make for bumpy flights so I am more prepared for those bumps. Window seats and seeing out the window are helpful for me. Wishing you the best on your journey. You can do this!"

With average highs reaching 43°C (109°F) in July and August with humidity levels soaring past 70%, traditional outdoor workouts become nearly impossible. GymNation's new class offers a refreshing alternative, combining cutting-edge fitness programming with temperature-controlled training to deliver maximum impact, without the meltdown. Rory McEntee, Chief Marketing Officer at GymNation, stated: ""At GymNation, we pride ourselves on being the people's gym and that means listening to what our members need. When the summer heat hits its peak in July and August, finding ways to stay active without overheating becomes a real challenge. With 'The Coolest Class in Dubai,' we're turning that challenge into an opportunity offering a fun, refreshing way to beat the heat while still smashing fitness and wellness goals."" Cold workouts place additional demands on the cardiovascular system, enhancing heart function and circulation. Beyond physical advantages, training in the cold builds mental toughness, requiring focus, discipline, and resilience to push through discomfort. A Chilling Workout Experience The Coolest Class in Dubai combines high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with cold-based challenges to create a one-of-a-kind workout: Blizzard Sprints - Treadmill runs against giant fans simulate resistance while staying cool Frosted Reps - Squats with ice-packed weighted vests that enhances strength with a cold twist. Glacier Grip Challenge - Ice bucket farmer's carries that challenge grip and endurance. Polar Push - sled pushes with ice blocks to boost power and stability. Chill Zone Recovery - post-workout ice bath to reduce inflammation and accelerate recovery. Participants are provided with insulated gloves and headgear to maintain comfort during the chilly sessions. Chilled towels are also available to help regulate body temperature throughout the workout. Expert Insights Aderito Manuel, a renowned sports scientist, commented on the benefits of cold-environment training: ""Exercising in cold environments may seem daunting at first, but it offers distinct health benefits. When exposed to lower temperatures, the body works harder to regulate its core temperature, leading to a 5-11% boost in oxygen volume in the blood compared to temperate conditions due to increased cardiac output and oxygen utilisation, resulting in greater endurance. This process also increases calorie burn by ~300kcal/day through brown adipose tissue (BAT) activation. Studies show athletes training in cold environments develop up to 17% higher pain tolerance and lower rates of perceived exertion (RPE) post-adaptation."" A Trendy Solution The name ""The Coolest Class in Dubai"" carries a double meaning. Beyond the literal coolness of the environment, it taps into the insight of seeking the most innovative and exciting fitness experiences. Recent trends indicate a growing interest in unique workout classes in the region with searches on Google and social media for cool classes or gyms in Dubai is up by 23% YOY. Join the Movement Experience the fusion of fitness and refreshment.

mov_E88D883268E7F14D210875670F18360C,2025-07-03 11:15:14,en,WEB,"  A team led by the California Institute of Technology (Caltech) has developed a safe, effective, and painless breast imaging technique that incorporates machine learning to help differentiate between suspicious and healthy tissue. The method has now been tested on patients and performs as well as or better than other conventional breast imaging techniques. For decades, X-ray mammography has been the gold standard of breast imaging for the early detection of breast cancer. While the technique remains valuable in terms of reducing cancer deaths, it does expose patients to small amounts of ionizing radiation, painfully squeezes breasts to allow X-rays to more easily pass through tissue, and, especially in the case of dense breast tissue, produces many false positive diagnoses. We'd like to make PACT a clinical tool that benefits patients—to help detect breast cancer without patients taking the risk of getting cancer or worrying about an allergic reaction Lihong Wang Other techniques such as ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can be used for breast imaging, but these also have problems. Ultrasound is very safe, but its accuracy is dependent on the skill of the operator and the results are not always conclusive. MRI is time-intensive, expensive, and cannot be used on patients who are allergic to contrast agents or those who are claustrophobic or have certain implants. ""We were strongly motivated to work on this problem because none of the current techniques are perfect,"" says Lihong Wang, the Bren Professor of Medical Engineering and Electrical Engineering at Caltech. ""The future of medicine has to be better than that."" The technique that Wang and his colleagues have developed and refined over the past 20 years is called photoacoustic computed tomography, or PACT. It offers a breast imaging alternative without the discomfort, high costs, or risk associated with the conventional evaluation methods. PACT features a laser-sonic scanner that can identify tumors in as little as 15 seconds. Working with researchers at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, California, the team has tested PACT on 39 patients. It achieved comparable results to mammography and MRI in terms of differentiating between suspicious and normal tissue as well as malignant and benign growths or lumps. The scientists describe PACT and their clinical results in a new paper in the journal Nature Biomedical Engineering. The lead authors of the paper are Xin Tong (MS '21), Cindy Z. Liu, and Yilin Luo, graduate students in the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Department of Medical Engineering at Caltech; along with Li Lin (PhD '20), who completed the work while at Caltech and is now at Zhejiang University in China. Recommended article News • Breast cancer Of the quarter-million women diagnosed with breast cancer every year in the United States, about 180,000 undergo surgery to remove the cancerous tissue while preserving as much healthy breast tissue as possible. However, there's no accurate method to tell during surgery whether all of the cancerous tissue has been successfully removed. ""This is the culmination of literally decades of work,"" says Wang, who is also the Andrew and Peggy Cherng Medical Engineering Leadership Chair and executive officer for medical engineering at Caltech. ""We'd like to make PACT a clinical tool that benefits patients—to help detect breast cancer without patients taking the risk of getting cancer or worrying about an allergic reaction."" PACT works by shining a near-infrared laser pulse into the breast tissue. The laser light diffuses through the breast and is absorbed by molecules. For example, it can be absorbed by oxygen-carrying hemoglobin molecules in the patient's red blood cells, causing the molecules to vibrate ultrasonically. Images of the same breast in two patients with invasive ductal carcinoma, shown from mammography (left), contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI, middle), and non-invasive photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT, right). PACT is less affected by breast density than mammography and reveals more feeding vessels than MRI, as indicated by dashed arrows. Image credit: Xin Tong/Caltech Optical Imaging Laboratory Unlike X-rays, which travel in a straight line, light waves scatter, or bounce around inside tissues, making it difficult to get high-resolution images. So PACT combines light and sound into a single modality. ""We use light to see the molecules, but we use sound to define the spatial location,"" Wang says. The vibrations from the molecules travel through the tissue and are picked up by an array of 512 tiny ultrasonic sensors placed over the skin of the breast. Data from those sensors are used to assemble an image of the breast's internal structures in a process that is similar to ultrasound imaging, though much more precise. PACT can provide a clear view of structures as small as a quarter of a millimeter at a depth of 4 centimeters. ""We basically use molecules to figure out the body's physiology,"" Wang says. ""That's the beauty of photoacoustic tomography: By detecting molecules, we can figure out exactly how the body is functioning. When there's a functional difference, that means we can potentially detect disease better."" For example, PACT is excellent at detecting hemoglobin and therefore revealing angiogenesis, a common signature of breast cancer that involves the growth of additional blood vessels to deliver more nutrient-rich blood to cancerous cells. PACT can also detect tumor hypoxia, another signature of cancer, where fast metabolism outstrips the blood supply, leaving parts of the tumor starved of oxygen. With the maturity of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, Wang says PACT has become better at detecting abnormalities in breast tissue than it was a few years ago. The scientists trained the system on images of malignant and benign growths or lumps as well as suspicious and healthy tissue, improving its ability to notice subtle variations that indicate what type of tissue has been imaged. Indeed, Wang says, PACT can often detect problematic features that would likely go unnoticed by the human eye. During a PACT scan, the patient lies face down on a table with a recess containing a warm water bath, ultrasonic sensors, and the laser. One breast at a time is placed in the recess, and the laser shines into it from below. Because the technique is rapid, each scan can be accomplished while the patient holds their breath. ""We started with a basic lab system—just a single-element ultrasound transducer that we rotated around—and it took forever. Now we can do 3D imaging during a single breath, making it very practical,"" Wang says. Wang adds that in some ways, the new work is just the beginning, as the team believes it will be able to further enhance the technique's imaging quality by adding additional laser wavelengths to the two they currently use and improving additional features...."

The Final Four: • Fairlane Town Center (Dearborn) • Southland Center (Taylor) • Laurel Park Place (Livonia) • Westland Mall (Westland) Each mall is scored on foot traffic, food court availability, and how many people are still pretending it's 2007. Southland is a top seed, powered by Cinemark, Ulta, H&M, and a Best Buy. “You can still get a pretzel and your eyebrows done in one trip,” said Mike Hunt, local shopper. “That's more than I can say for my marriage.” Fairlane, once counted out, is surging after renovations. With Macy's, H&M, Sephora, Zara, and a lively food court, it's the surprise comeback of the bracket. “It's the only place I've seen a working escalator and a Cinnabon in the same day,” said Buster Highman, local shopper and voter. Laurel Park wins points for being clean, calm, and oddly soothing. Anchored by Von Maur and Dunham's, it's basically a quiet place for mall walkers. “It's like a mall on Ambien,” said a former mall employee, Dia Rhea. Westland Mall is the wildcard. Most stores are gone, but a stubborn handful like Bath & Body Works and Victoria's Secret still hang on. “You go for the nostalgia,” said Westland resident Drew Peacock, “and because the ghost of Payless whispers deals to you in the hallway.” Meanwhile, Somerset and 12 Oaks are watching the bracket like rich cousins at a family reunion. “We don't really get involved with that side of the family,” said Somerset shopper, Dick Hertz. “But good luck to… whichever one has the pretzels.” The winner will receive a championship banner made from Auntie Anne's napkins and a Bath & Body Works candle labeled “Last One Lit.” Voting ends next week…assuming none of them shut down first."

mov_99826F6DAC649A633CFAF2B9FD87B2BD,2025-07-03 15:00:55,en,WEB,"  Subject of a fierce bidding war, this charming debut shows Trevelyan has an impressive knack for character, but is let down by a predictable plot Writing a story from a child's perspective works like a filter over a lens. Novels such as Sofie Laguna's The Eye of the Sheep, Craig Silvey's Jasper Jones and Mark Haddon's The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-time use a younger person's narration to process darker, adult themes and reveal the mythologies of the adult world. Jennifer Trevelyan's debut A Beautiful Family uses a similar framing to tell an immersive yet imperfect coming-of-age mystery set in New Zealand. It's 1985, and 10-year-old Alix – a tomboyish, inquisitive girl who is never without her red Walkman and Split Enz cassette tape – is on holiday with her family, who have left their Wellington home for the nearby Kāpiti Coast. Her novelist mother normally prefers secluded spots, but this time she has curiously opted for a populous beach town. Between her parents' bickering and her older sister's burgeoning interest in boys and alcohol, Alix has often felt invisible. This has made her a keen observer, and she understands more than people think. At the outset, Alix befriends a 12-year-old Māori boy named Kahu with whom she soon becomes inseparable. He invites her over to his house, which is full of cooking aunties, rowdy cousins and dogs – a contrast to Alix's loving yet somewhat siloed family. One day Kahu tells her about Charlotte, a young girl who drowned in the area a few years prior. The two children decide to search for her missing body, combing the beach and the nearby lagoon for remains. But as their investigation stretches on, other secrets begin to emerge. What is Alix's mother doing on her long walks? And who is the strange old man next door always watching them? Alix grasps at the truth of things, but her perspective means only the reader parses the more adult story unravelling around her. This framing is craftily handled, with Trevelyan building suspense as the underlying narratives coalesce, delving into familial ties, a child's desire for harmony, and the pinballing of a child on the brink of adolescence. Innocence is deftly chipped away, and some unsettling revelations begin to dawn on Alix. “Now I understood that a family wasn't a particularly solid thing,” she says. “It was a bubble purely of our own making and just like a bubble, it could burst.” A Beautiful Family is most enriching in Trevelyan's knack for character; Alix, Vanessa and her parents are all distinctive and familiar from the start, even with the story taking place from a single point of view. However, the novel stalls somewhat in pace and plot about halfway through, meandering into overwriting and a surfeit of detail – there are four consecutive pages on Alix's Walkman, for example. The novel's imagery also veers from tactile clarity (“the lagoon, flat and quiet as a bath”) to lines a bit sensorially inert. (“The soup had a dusty taste, like the inside of a long unopened cupboard.”) There's also a curious undercurrent of racial microaggressions. Alix's mother says that “Chinese people tend to look alike”. A school friend of Vanessa's, Crystal, mentions a boy with mixed parents has skin with the “perfect mix”. And when Alix is invited to Kahu's house for lunch, her mother becomes overly concerned about whether there's enough food. Trevelyan handles these inclusions delicately, and some help evoke the flawed nature of her characters. But though they appear to build towards something – an evocation of internalised prejudices, of casual discrimination, of a white child's recognition of cultural difference – they ultimately never really say anything impactful. By the novel's end, Alix and Kahu, having spent the summer playing detective, suddenly stumble across a much darker discovery. Treveylan pulls some of her threads taut while leaving others loose – and yet the secrets she does reveal are predictable and only end up undercutting her otherwise immersive story. Indeed, A Beautiful Family is a charming debut, bringing life to Tolstoy's adage that every unhappy family is unhappy in its own way, but it gets mired in what turns out to be a lacklustre mystery. Hopefully, Trevelyan's next work will lean more on her evident strengths. A Beautiful Family by Jennifer Trevelyan is out now in Australia (Allen & Unwin, $32.99), UK (Pan Macmillan, £16.99, £15.29 on the Guardian Bookshop) and the US (Penguin Random House, US$28)"
n153vua,2025-07-03 15:24:36,en,REDDIT,"  I've been where you are and have some hacks!! People already shared a lot of great shower/bath hacks… so I'll share some different ideas: 1) [This stuff](https://bellaskinbeauty.com/products/watermelon-probiotic-underarm-tonerProbioticUnderarmToner%E2%80%93BellaSkinBeauty) is stupid expensive, but my GOD it works like nothing I've ever used!!!! I've had bad bouts of depression where I didn't shower for 3+ days and stunk to high hell. A few sprays on each pit and I smelled incredible for the whole day!! I imagine the spearmint one would be a good “manly” scent. I use Vanilla. (I'm not affiliated with the company) 2) Get a bidet. Your butt will thank you. I have [this](https://www.walmart.com/ip/5240912005?sid=2c1e1a46-dd77-4574-8578-4affd2b79ac1) cheapo one from Walmart that I installed myself. I'm not particularly handy and it was super easy to install. 3) I'm allergic to toothpaste, so I switched to this [tooth oil](https://www.amazon.com/OraWellness-Toothpaste-Mouthwash-Alternative-Promotes/dp/B00ABN97WIAmazon.com:OraWellnessHealthyMouthBlendOrganicToothOil,FluorideFreeMadeinTheUSAToothpaste&MouthwashAlternativeTooth,NaturalRinseforHealthyTeeth&GumsforWomen,MenandKids,Packof1:Toothpastes:Health&Household) and it's AMAZING. It balances your oral Microbiome and kills the bad germs that cause gum disease and bad breath. You only need a couple of drops on a toothbrush and don't need to rinse your mouth after if you don't want to. The founder of the company brushes his teeth in his car! You can also add drops to a little water to make mouthwash. It's incredible stuff. My breath is SO much better since I started using it. (Not affiliated with this company either.) 4) Keep a bag (or put some in a little mason jar like I do) of floss picks where you watch TV at night. My husband and I floss after dinner during TV time. Neither of us were consistent flossers until we developed this habit. 5) Wiping your body down with a wet washcloth will make you feel much cleaner when you can't force yourself to shower. Bidet your undercarriage, wipe yourself down with a washcloth and use the probiotic underarm toner on your pits and feet. You'll be fresh as the morning dew. lol"
1lqsexg,2025-07-03 15:25:45,en,REDDIT,"  I think I've had BV for most of my life, though I didn't know it. Growing up, I thought using good-smelling soap would make things smell better down there. My mom always used soap on my vulva, and some would actually make it smell worse — Dove was the absolute worst. So, when I started making my own money, I went to Bath & Body Works and bought their fragranced liquid soap, thinking it would help. It did a little… but I still had a very strong odor. Whenever I had discharge, I could smell it through my clothes. It didn't always smell strongly of fish — I think my body got used to it and it mixed with my natural scent — but still, it was noticeable. I'd read articles online that said “having a smell is normal,” so I thought I was fine. I didn't know much about infections, and since I showered daily and kept up with hygiene, I assumed I was doing everything right. I do remember moments where I questioned my smell. Like… why didn't I ever notice any odor from other girls, even when we were in  close proximity? I'll never forget this one time at the club — I went to the bathroom with my friend, and since the line was long, we shared a stall. When I pulled down my underwear, there was a smell, as usual. But when she did? Nothing. That moment really stuck with me, but I never thought to bring it up to my doctor. The first time I really started to think something might be wrong was when I got on Depo-Provera. Suddenly, there was no smell at all — it was like magic. But a year later, I stopped because it affected my mood too much. That's when I noticed my natural smell returning, and I made it my mission to get back to that odorless hooha I had while on Depo. I changed soaps, use no soap, changed how I washed my vulva — and eventually, I found a “perfect” routine and stuck to it for a few years. Then one day, I was fooling around with my boyfriend and we used a sented wax candle. That's how I got diagnosed with BV for the first time (yes, I got tested). The treatment worked really well, but it gave me a yeast infection — which I didn't know at the time, so I thought it was just normal discharge. A few years later, I got BV again after some “ice play,” and that's when the recurring BV really started. I'll spare you the in-between, but fast-forward to last month: I realized I'd actually had recurrent BV this whole time. I had taken metronidazole every month since January, and more than five times last year. When I finally saw my doctor, she told me the only thing she could offer was a months-long course of metro. I'm sorry, but I wasn't about to give up terrasse season for something that might work — with no guarantee. When I went to the pharmacy to pick up the meds, I cried in front of the pharmacist. I was just so tired of this recurring infection that never seemed to fully go away — and worried about what it might do to my kidneys over time. I didn't want another “maybe.” I wanted a real plan. So, I went home, cried some more, and then did my research. That's when I learned about biofilm and boric acid. I read more, and with the help of ChatGPT (shoutout 🫶), we came up with a plan: since my BV symptoms were gone (no smell), I'd start a 14-day treatment with boric acid at night, while taking Garden of Life probiotics every morning (they contain the bacteria strains recommended for vaginal health). I just finished my 15-day boric treatment on Monday, and I've continued taking my probiotics daily (which I plan to do until the bottle runs out). I got my period yesterday — and guess what? No smell. Not before my period. Not during my period. Not even a hint. My friends… if you know, you know: the ultimate test is always your period. And so far? I think I might have cured it. I'm so, so happy. I'll update you all a few days after my period ends — but for now, this feels like the beginning of a fresh, clean chapter in my life 💕✨ (Thank you ChatGPT for correcting my text.

mov_EE5637647AFF610EC6F502CD8FEB6169,2025-07-03 21:35:28,en,WEB,"  The secret to the U.S. Marine Corps' success is a blending of bedrock principles with innovation, the commander of U.S. Central Command said here last night. Using two examples from recent history -- the heroism of the last Marine Medal of Honor recipient and the turnaround in Iraq's Anbar province, -- Army Gen. David H. Petraeus shared his view at an event hosted by the Marine Association Foundation. “On the one hand, Marines display a stalwart resistance to change in those bedrock values that form the very foundation of what it means to be Marine,” he said. “On the other hand, Marines demonstrate a ready embrace of innovation that allows them to adapt to the environments in which they operate and to the enemies they face.” Some of those timeless, unchanging truths that describe the Marine Corps include an unflinching devotion to one's fellow Marines, a ready embrace of hardship and a universal emphasis on the skills and the spirit of the rifleman, he said. Petraeus said these underlying principles are illustrated in the story of Marine Corps Cpl. Jason Dunham. In 2004, the 22-year-old Marine was killed in action in Karabilah, Iraq, when he used his body to cover a grenade and shield his fellow Marines from the ensuing blast. Dunham became the 295th Marine to receive the Medal of Honor, the nation's highest military decoration, which is bestowed for gallantry in action. The Navy will christen a ship named in the fallen Marine's honor -- the USS Jason Dunham -- next week during a ceremony at Bath Iron Works, Bath, Maine. Petraeus said the Marines' actions in Anbar province illustrate their ability to adapt their strategy to meet unique challenges. In 2006, Anbar province was one of Iraq's most contentious regions. It was a society that had collapsed under the weight of an endemic insurgency with an infrastructure dilapidated by years of infighting and neglect. But amid the surge of U.S. forces in 2007, al-Qaida operatives overplayed their hands in Anbar, alienating local residents. Meanwhile, the influx of U.S. Marines helped to tamp down violence and create political breathing room, which in turn allowed the forging of key alliances between local tribal sheiks and coalition operators. “As a result, sheiks started coming forward to coalition forces to discuss an alliance to throw off al-Qaida,” Petraeus said. “And this was the opening we needed.” The “Anbar Awakening,” a societal purging of extremism by Anbaris, and formation of a civilian security group known as “Sons of Iraq” ushered in a level of stability unprecedented since U.S. operations in Iraq began. “It is not an exaggeration to say that the Anbar Awakening helped alter the course of events in Iraq,” Petraeus said. “And I believe that generations from now, historians will continue to view it as a great example of the principled application of long-standing counterinsurgency principles.” Story by John J.

I use the expensive lubricant eye drops for moisture — I've used Visine, Clear Eyes, you name it. No eye drop has made my eyes look this great. Only Lumify!

mov_24E0EF63EE74B59966352B8C0D7B72BE,2025-07-04 09:38:09,en,WEB,"  Chapter 87 Art in Alchemy: Visual Communication of Symbols Until the 1980s, alchemists were considered pseudo-scientists, and their efforts to transmute base metals into gold were described as futile. However, at the end of the 20th century, by deciphering the complicated alchemical texts, some researchers came to believe that the alchemists had in fact made a significant contribution to the development of science. Alchemical texts have been obscured, by secrecy, as alchemists deliberately described their experiences in metaphorical terms derived from mythology and history. For example, the text that describes a ""cold dragon"" that ""goes in and out of caves"" was the code for saltpeter (potassium nitrate) - a crystalline substance found on cave walls that tastes cool on the tongue. Lawrence Principe, a chemist and historian of science at Johns Hopkins University, concocted some obscure texts of 17th-century lab notebooks to piece together a recipe for growing a ""philosophers tree"". Supposedly, this tree was a precursor to the more famous and elusive Philosopher's Stone, which is said to be able to transmute metals into gold. By mixing specially prepared mercury and gold in a buttery form at the bottom of a vial and burying the sealed vial in a heated sand bath in his laboratory, Principe discovered that the vial was filled with ""a. sparkling and fully formed golden tree "". The mixture of metals had grown upward to form a coral-like structure or the branching canopy of a tree without the leaves. This was part of a growing evidence that alchemists seem to have performed legitimate experiments, manipulated and analyzed the material world in interesting ways, and reported genuine results. Alchemical image of the Divine Sophia as a Tree of Learning and source of the Elixir of Life. As such, she was known to alchemists as Sapientia, Lady Wisdom, Lady Nature, Alkimia. The multi-walled enclosure around her may suggest the multi-banded cosmos of the archons. Metaphorically, it represents the alcove of learning, then the exoteric, mesoteric, and esoteric chambers of divine instruction. From many  20th century discoveries of Sassanian  silver vessels that are now placed in various museums, we can identify this goddess as Ardvi Sura Anahita,  from  the pantheon of the  ancient  Iranian religion of Mitra. She was a mother and fertility goddess, who as the goddess of the water of life, presenting all living beings to drink the life-giving water of the haoma, the Elixir of Life, which flowed  forth from the tree of life. According to Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin,, in his La Religion de l'Iran Ancien, Les Anciens Religions Orientales IIIr:""The haoma is not only a plant and a liquor, it is also a god: for him  are sacrifices made, and certain parts of the sacrificial victim were reserved for him. Being a god, one kills him by pressing him. The brahmanas say the same thing of Soma. "" We can also see the image of Anahita, on the stone relief  at Taq-i Bustan,  giving  the princely  diadem  to King Pirooz I. As well, on the stone relief at Naqsh-i Rustam, where Anahita  presents King Narse  with the Farreh-Izadi, the divine symbol of his sovereign power on the occasion of his investiture. The work of art in Alchemy literature, using wide-ranging symbolism, methaphorical concepts, and surreal legends to express the association of chemical and physical concepts with esoteric and mystic ones constitutes a fascinating genre of visual communication design. At its core exhibiting a very fine balance between metaphysical aspects of life and reality of the chemical processes, which not only invites  viewers to explore spiritual processes, but also suggests , most often fraudulent and sometimes genuine, efforts  to resolve some actual scientific challenges to transmute a base metal into gold or to find a substance that could eradicate death and provide immortality. Many Europeans consider the Persian prophet Zoraster as the ""inventor"" of both magic and astrology. However, in the Hellenic heritage, Zoaraster was the ""prophet and founder of the religion of the Iranian peoples"" (e.g. Plutarch Isis and Osiris 46-7, Diogenes Laertius 1.6-9 and Agathias 2.23-5), ""the rest was mostly fantasy."" He was assumed of belonging to a deeply- ancient past, six or seven millennia BC, and was presented as a sovereign of Bactria, or a cobbler (or a teacher) living on the shores of Babylon. Similar to the ancient Rig Veda that contains hundreds of verses concerning soma, how to press and sieve plants, how to store it and drink it, in order to release its exhilarating and intoxicating effect, Zoroasterin literature is partial to huoma, one of the two trees in the original garden of paradise, a tree with the gift of immortality. Zoroaster, riding on the back of a fire-breathing salamander,  with three roses in his hand representing body, soul and spirit. 18th century alchemical manuscript - Clavis Artis. Biblioteca dell'Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei, Roma, vol. 1. Deriving from the alchemical practice and its symbolism, underpinned by an extensive literature rooted in  four papyrus rolls of the Asteroskopita (or Apotelesmatika) dealing with astrology or one lost papytus roll of Peri lithon timion (On Virtue of Stones) among other of alleged books of Zoroaster, including his  lost works that appear in many fragments in the works of others, that circulated the Mediterranean world (from the 3rd century BC), he was perceived as the founder the magi and of their magic arts. As well, Zoroaster's patron King Hystaspes and his disciple Ostanes who was described by the 4th century BC Hermodorus (apud Diogenes Laertius Prooemium ) as being a magus in the long line of magi descending from Zoroaster, were considered as practitioner of “magic” – Greek magikos. Pliny the Elder named Zoroaster as the inventor of magic, but that Ostanes was the first writer of it (Natural History 30.2.3, the 1st-century). ""This Ostanes,"" so Pliny reports, was a Persian magus, who had accompanied Xerxes in his invasion of Greece, and who had then introduced magicis the “ the most fraudulent of the arts, ” to that country. According to Pliny, Ostanes ' introduction of the “monstrous craft” to the Greeks gave those people not only a “lust” ( aviditatem) for magic, but downright “madness” (rabiem ), and many of their philosophers, such as Pythagoras, Empedocles, Democritus, and Plato traveled abroad to study it and then returned to teach it. (xxx.2.8-10). Pliny also transmits Ostanes' definition of magic: “As Ostanes said, there are several different kinds of it: he professes to divine ( divina promittit) from water, globes, air, stars, lamps, basins, and axis, and by many other methods. And besides to converse with ghosts and those in the underworld” (XXX.2.8.-10). By the end of 1st century AD Ostanes is cited as an authority on alchemy, necromancy, divination, and on the mystical properties of plants and stones. Both his legend and literary output attributed to him increased with time, and by the 4th century he had become one of the great authorities in alchemy. The 18th century occultist Francis Barrett wrote of the influence of Zoroaster on the great and noble art of alchemy, in the clearest of terms: Alchymy, the grand touchstone of natural wisdom, is of divine origin: it was brought down from Heaven by the Angel Uriel. Zoroaster, the first philosopher by fire, made pure gold from all seven metals; he brought the sun ten times brighter from the bed of Saturn, and fixed it with the moon, who thereby copulating, begot numerous offspring of an immortal nature, a pure living spiritual sun, burning in the refulgency of its own..."

A pet hair remover because pets shed more in the summer, especially if they have a double coat. This reusable roller works on carpets, couches, beds, and even clothes — and the included detailer works for small areas where the larger roller can't reach. And since this roller works by trapping fur in nylon bristles instead of sticky tape, it can be cleaned and reused over and over. Promising review: ""I bought this because obviously, I have a cat. Love my cat but, she sleeps in the crook of my arm at night and I have cat hair up my nose and everywhere else. Thank you for this product, and I appreciated the thank you card included in the box. These two removers work wonderfully on the job they're supposed to perform. I love the mini detailer which is a breeze to use and is very effective at every task it tackles. Wish I had bought them 50 years ago. Excellent purchase."" —James Price: $13.49 (originally $21.99) 2. An 11-quart portable cooler that has a carrying strap that you will be SO grateful for when it comes time to bust out the drinks at your next softball game or lake expedition. Keeping both of your hands free — what an innovation! Promising review: “This small cooler is perfect for carrying a few items with a nice pink outer color. Everything I wanted to take fit nicely inside. Handy strap carrier was also a plus. Instead of tying up one of my hands, it freed it because the strap fit right on my shoulder. "" —Debbie Price: $39.98 (available in two colors) 3. A foldable camp chair, because summer presents no shortage of events where you'd like to sit, but nary a seat can be found: outdoor concerts, Little League games, trips to the beach, a three-hour line outside a bakery to get a croissant-bagel hybrid you heard about on TikTok...you get the idea. This chair is lightweight and folds into a carrying case, so you might want to get a few and throw 'em in the back of your car for the whole season. Promising review: ""Love the bright red color and great shoulder strap to transport. So comfortable to sit in and cup holder idea. I have a small area on my outside stair landing where I wanted a chair and table. This was the perfect answer.

This air cooler operates by remote control and also works as a regular fan and humidifier, so it'll help you out all year round. Promising review: ""Nashville's blazing, but this cooler's a game-changer on our patio. It's super easy to use — just add water, hit power, and you're set. I've ditched my old fan for this.

n1ifozf,2025-07-05 18:41:53,en,REDDIT,"  Back with another set of reviews! My workplace is very dead today, so I've been enjoying reminiscing on my product purchases and reviewing them. I know most of these can't be purchased now, but I hope this is fun anyway! *Hello Kitty shower gel* - I really wasn't sure about ordering this one! I'm a little done with Snow Fairy products, although I do generally like the scent profile. But I caved, and I'm not sorry! It's a fabulous, lighter take on Snow Fairy. The sweet milky notes of Milky Bath and SF are there, but the addition of the strawberry and orange oil makes it fresh. I almost get hints of cantaloupe?? It's an amazing scent for summer. Syrupy but not cloying. I've been reaching for this a lot. *Bitzer body balm* - Like everybody else on earth, I beg Lush to make this a permanent product. Not just the scent, which is totally Hi-Chew candy and DELICIOUS, but the product itself. By far the best body balm I've used. The mango oil was soooo hydrating and thicc (in a good way). I loved the shape and size. I'm SO sorry I only purchased one. It was such a bright spot in my shower routine. *The Old Songs Are Waking body scrub* - This product is so aptly named. My mom made fun of it being nonsensical, but I GET it! This awoke things in me. I consider this to be a classic Lush scent alongside the likes of Supermilk, LoM, Turmeric Latte, Posh Choc & Rose etc. in that it is so unique and layered that you'll not find anything similar elsewhere. Before purchasing, I'd read a lot about the powdery/clean laundry notes, which scared me as I'm not big on that. And those notes are there, to be sure, but they WORK. They work so beautifully with the light, fruity sorbet scents it's unreal. I get just a hint of clean vanilla, the pink peppercorn notes, and a wonderful mix of bergamot and berry. This is my scent. I want to live in it & be known for it. My regret at not purchasing the body spray last year haunts me daily. If anybody is looking to offload one in Canada, hit. me. UP. This is also undoubtedly my favourite scrub I've used, texture-wise. The coconut oil and fine castor sugar are extremely smooth and moisturizing. I use it as a gentle exfoliant and them just shave with the leftover oils. It's a great two-in-one. *Happy Skin enzyme exfoliator* - I'm a sucker for gimmicks, OK? Not saying this product is a gimmick, but the idea of the bromelain enzymes in the pineapple/jackfruit breaking down my dead skin just makes sense to me, and I love the concept. I mean, pineapple surely eats tf out of my tongue and gums while I'm eating it lol! Overall, this is not life changing product, but it's definitely a lovely gentle mechanical and chemical exfoliant that I'm happy to have in my routine. I use it about 3x weekly after washing my face with the Turmeric Roll cleanser and let it sit on my face for a few minutes while I wash my body. I feel a little brighter afterward and it gets my dry bits off my nose. Because of the fine nut/bamboo powder, I do skip this one on days where my skin feels more sensitive. I'll typically use the Cosmetic Warrior mask instead on those days. *Naughty Pigs shower jelly* - This was such a delight to open, lol. Totally impractical and now a couple months later it's shredded to teeny jelly bits, but I don't care because the pigs were so cute. I know nothing about Shaun the Sheep; I'm just here for the concept and scent! I know the sand sprinkled throughout turned some people off and it does absolutely nothing, but I don't care because it's so on theme and I loved it. I'm glad Lush still adds those little details...."

n1kwr6g,2025-07-06 03:51:39,en,REDDIT,"  I've gotten a few and the quality is pretty much the same. There are tons on Amazon, I got one from Seraphic Skincare. You can also look up Korean exfoliating mitt or viscose exfoliating mitt. It works best if you're in the shower or a bath for about 10 minutes before you try to scrub. I use it without soap and don't scrub too hard. Then wash with body wash or soap. I do it once or twice a week at most. Use lotion after if you have sensitive skin (especially if you use it on your face)."

Or like when she showed up in a video using Flower Knows makeup, which is more expensive than drugstore but still cheaper than anything high end."
n1m18di,2025-07-06 10:07:57,en,REDDIT,"  I used to work in retail- most stores have really good return policies. Companies want to please the customer. They want you to come back and keep spending your money. Most places will usually take anything back- usually for full price or for a reduced price depending on different factors. The process is also usually pretty easy and hassle free. If you're ever having issues at a particular location/with an associate, they're just being difficult for no reason. Go to another location, on a different day, or try CS online. If you're ever worried about a return, look up the return policy online. An example store would be Ulta: I usually try to keep my box and receipt, because I'm anxious and want to make the process as smooth as possible. They honestly don't really need anything. When you go in they will ask if you have a receipt. If you don't, they can look up the purchase on your account with phone number. They may ask you how much was used or a reason for returning- sometimes they don't. They'll scan it and return the money. The process literally takes less than 5 minutes. Another example is Amazon: You can start the return in the app and return it to your local Kohls. You do 90% of it online. Take the QR code to the return desk and they will scan it and take it. No questions asked. When I worked at Bath and Body Works our return policy was 100% guarantee. This was back 2019-2021, so the policy has definitely changed. At the time you could literally return anything. It could be fully used or 1 year old- we had to take it. I saw your comment about it being an inconvenience, but it's not any weight on the employee. It's just another “transaction”. They would come in with their item. I would ask the reasoning because the system wants to know- I genuinely didn't care. I was just asking so I could press a button. If it was an item we still had in stock, the customer would get a full refund. If it was an old item that was no longer sold, I would grab a correlating item in one of the core collections and use that bar code. You would get back what the price of that was, even if it wasn't what you paid. If they wanted to exchange items, it would be a 1 for 1 thing. If you spent $49.95, you would go get your items totaling to $49.95. After the transaction was done, I would just toss the items on a shelf in the back. No hassle to me."

I'd been looking at Mystic's roster since they re-opened as it isn't far from work and Chase really caught my eye. Icegodofhungary mentioned that he had written an A/R and it confirmed that I wanted to try. https://www.aus99forum.com/showthrea...x-(via-Brazil) Managed to get a booking for shortly after they opened and off I went. Entry is off Crown street (quite busy) or via rear entry of Crown Lane. Premises are clean and newly refurbished. Gent on reception was polite and after fixing finances was asked to take a seat as she got the room ready. After a few minutes I was invited down to room 8. Room was large, reasonably well lit with bed, spa, ensuite and what looked like a huge walk-in shower. The best part about the room was the goddess standing inside in tall black boots, lingerie and a button down shirt fully open. Hubba da hubba. If you are after an Asian waif, Chase is not for you. She is more Amazon warrior with a lean muscular body and flowing black hair. It was definitely a good selection. Body is tanned, but obviously keeps covered up when on the beach as her bikini line is apparent both around her breasts and pussy. All in all, a wondrous sight to behold After we both got undressed and stepped into the spa bath for a quick wash down with the hand-held shower. Looking down at this vision of beauty, squatting down and gently cleaning my cock, I was in heaven. After a quick shower and mouthwash it was time to adopt the position face down on the bed, that had a waterproof covering and towel on top. I've had a few massages but this was my first Nuru. The gel had been warmed up and after some gentle massaging Chase got down to business rubbing her body against mine. It must have been a couple of days since she last shaved/waxed her pussy as they was a little regrowth but the combination of the slippery gel with the stubble felt electric. A bit of TT and neck kisses and then it was time to flip over and I got to really enjoy her body. She is advertised as C-cup and whilst I'm no expert I would have probably sized them more as B-cups. That being said, her nipples were very responsive to the touch and felt great suckling on them, which she seemed to enjoy. Chase rubbed herself all over me, using not only her hands, but legs and feet as well. Some light kissing was allowed. She had been chatty on and off up until this point and she soon had her mouth full sucking my cock (covered). The sight of her bobbing up and down took a huge amount of willpower not to blow there and then. She has sultry eyes that really do say 'Come fuck me' (on the cards for next time). CBJ was great with good suction, tongue action and no teeth. I held on for what felt like eternity and then let go into the bag. She slid up and cuddled, more kissing and some general chit chat. Before long the first buzzer went off, so it was back into the spa bath for another shower to wash the gel off and I got admire that body again. It is a wonderful feeling, being gently washed by a thing of beauty and treated like a king. Dry and dressed just as the second buzzer went off. Lovely embrace and more kissing then I departed...."
mov_AEFB248551A03D17FC51A9B3597B02CE,2025-07-07 00:43:02,en,WEB,"  A sense of déjà vu permeates the latest report on brand trust. Morning Consult's 2025 Most Reputable Brands analysis reveals that the companies consumers rely on most today bear a striking resemblance to those favored during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic. This resurgence of trust in established brands underscores a continued prioritization of safety, security, and essential needs, even as the world navigates a new normal. The report, which surveyed consumers across all demographics, highlights a consistent preference for brands associated with cleanliness, health, and reliable service. But what does this sustained loyalty tell us about the evolving consumer mindset and the enduring power of established brands in a rapidly changing world? Across all consumer touchpoints, a handful of categories consistently emerged as leaders in brand trust. These include: Home Keeping and Hygiene: Brands like Dawn, Clorox, Lysol, Mr. Clean, and Home Depot continue to be cornerstones of consumer confidence. Self- and Personal Care: Dove, Oral-B, Kleenex, and Colgate remain trusted staples in daily routines. Health: BAND-AID and Tylenol exemplify the enduring trust in brands providing essential healthcare solutions. Packages and Shipping/Ecommerce: UPS, Amazon, the United States Postal Service, and FedEx are vital for modern commerce and maintain high levels of consumer trust. And, let's not forget the comfort factor: Hershey's and M&M's demonstrate that even indulgence can be a source of reliable satisfaction. Maslow's Hierarchy and the Modern Consumer These favored brands directly address fundamental human needs, as outlined in Maslow's Hierarchy. From physiological needs (food, hygiene) to safety and security, consumers are gravitating towards brands that provide a sense of stability and well-being. This isn't simply nostalgia; it's a reflection of ongoing anxieties and a desire for predictability in an uncertain world. Deeper Dive: Trust Across Specific Verticals Morning Consult's analysis extended beyond broad categories, examining trust within specific consumer verticals. Health Sector Trust Leaders Medicines: Tylenol Health Retail: CVS Health Pharmaceuticals: Bayer Health Services: Minute Clinic at CVS Health Insurance: Blue Cross Blue Shields Personal Care Brand Leaders Personal Care: Dove Dental Care: Oral-B Skin Care: Vaseline Lip Care: ChapStick Beauty: Bath & Body Works Cosmetics: CeraVe Hair Care: Head & Shoulders Gyms: Planet Fitness Hair Services: Great Clips Fitness Equipment: NordicTrack Generational Divides in Brand Loyalty Trust isn't uniform across all age groups. Younger consumers, particularly Millennials and Gen Z, demonstrate a growing trust in social media platforms like TikTok and YouTube, while older generations tend to favor legacy brands with established reputations. This generational gap highlights the evolving role of media and marketing in shaping consumer perceptions. Adweek's analysis provides further insight into these differing perspectives. Pro Tip: Building brand trust requires consistent delivery on promises, transparent communication, and a genuine commitment to customer well-being. The Rise of Health and Sustainability Concerns Recent data from the dunnhumby Consumer Trends Tracker reinforces the growing importance of health and sustainability for U.S. consumers. Two-thirds of consumers prioritize sourcing products that align with their dietary needs, and nearly half believe retailers should actively support healthy choices. This trend extends to a preference for local businesses and products, driven by a desire for transparency and connection. As the 2025 Edelman Trust Barometer demonstrates, trust is increasingly built through local relationships rather than distant national brands. However, economic realities are also impacting consumer behavior. With potential cuts to SNAP benefits and rising food costs, one in four U.S. households, and over a third of those aged 18-34, have been forced to skip meals in the past year. This underscores the critical role of food security and the need for accessible, affordable nutrition. The growing movement towards “food as medicine” is gaining traction, recognizing that food is not merely sustenance but a fundamental component of health and well-being...."

n1tp9t5,2025-07-07 15:43:39,en,REDDIT,"  Carlos didn't jump off the cliff in his flesh body! Re-read it...  Remember how don Genaro was teasing him about pooping from fright, up at the top? At the same time he was jumping... It's pretty common to do what you read there. Defy gravity. Instead of a cliff, you can simply swipe the ceiling away and jump outside the galaxy. It even hurts when you land on a planet in a galaxy far, far away. Seemingly in your physical body, and completely sober, eyes wide open, moving around. Or you can go chasing a witch who visits while you practice, leaping around over the trees like a cheesy Kungfu movie. Cholita taunts me to chase after her once in a while, but she's in her double, while I'm in my (old) flesh body, so keeping up is impossible. You don't understand what was going on in the books because you didn't read carefully, so the only jumping you're doing is to false conclusions. It's not even a difficult technique, if you practice ""darkroom"". Which is merely tensegrity done in darkness, to make ""*seeing*"" easier. Now, the last time when Carlos jumped off the cliff, as don Juan left the world,  he ALSO DIDN'T  jump in his physical body! He jumped by shrinking the tonal, like the story ""Shrinking the Tonal"" in ""Tales of Power"", where Carlos was shoved 1 mile away by don Juan, and several days into the past or future. And then walked home from there. Later he discovered, he couldn't possibly have been pushed there because the coin stands weren't open. He was pushed into a dream version. Common...  If you actually do some work. When Carlos jumped off the cliff after don Juan left, he still didn't jump in his physical body. He simply ""woke up"" in his apartment in Los Angeles, 2 days travel away, in just a half hour or so. Likely don Juan helped him wake up there. Just like when he woke up in Arizona, having gone to sleep in Mexico, at which point Carol Tiggs had to plunge him into a cold bath to keep him from dying of fright. Here's a cartoon on how this all works.

There's no need to chop and prepare ingredients ahead of time — just wash them, toss 'em in, and watch as even the toughest of fruits are juiced in only a few minutes! This is designed with double-layer filters and a 7-stage spiral auger to help avoid heat generation and oxidation. Promising review: ""Game changer! Super quick to use as there's no need to peel or dice everything. Super quick to clean – just a few parts! I juiced a pineapple and three apples in under five minutes.

Promising review: ""We have been using this in muggy Houston. We put this under the pergola, and it puts out so much air that we actually enjoy sitting outside. We use it both with and without the mister. The mister has various levels, so a little mist to a lot. It really blows the air quite a distance. It's very sturdy and has a remote control. Very quiet and we feel like it is worth every penny!"" —Audrey Price: $199.99 (originally $249.99) 4. Up to 38% off a 15-piece set of airtight food containers if you've ever bought *another* bag of rice, not realizing that you already had two ~deeeep~ within your pantry.

There's adulting, and then there's organizational-pantry-excellence adulting. ✨ Promising review: ""I ordered this set to continue on the road to an organized pantry. There are enough containers and a variety of sizes to make me happy. I have stored pasta and noodles, dried beans, rice, sugar, instant mashed potatoes, crackers, etc. When I open a box of something, I put whatever is unused into one of the containers and feel very secure that the contents will be fresh and protected from any possible insect problems."" —R M Price: $24.99+ (originally $40.27; available in three different lid colors) 5...."

In a video uploaded to TikTok earlier this month, one driver explained that on more than one occasion, an order he was meant to deliver had to be returned to its sender because the package could not withstand the heat of the shipping process. Surprisingly, the ""reminder"" wasn't about ordering chocolate, but rather candles. ""I don't know who needs to hear this, but now is not a good time to buy candles online,"" he shared in the clip. ""The truck gets very hot, the candles melt, it gets everywhere, you do not receive the candles, I send them back to the shipper."" @minton__jr @Peacock ♬ original sound - J.R. Minton Related: The Unexpected Thing a Formula Drift Pro Checks Before Every Road Trip The video quickly racked up over 136,000 views and 22,000 likes, reaching other sectors of the industry that echoed the advice. ""Mailman here,"" one TikToker wrote. ""Same for us."" ""I used to work for a catering company we did a summer wedding and the candles were totally melted by the time we got there lol,"" someone else shared. Viewers seemed to appreciate the tip, even if it means they must wait until they're next in-store visit to pick up a new scent (which isn't standing in the aisle snuiffing all the candles, half the fun of getting a new one?) . ""Thank you for the reminder!"" one applauded. ""This is insane that it would never have occurred to me!!"" a second admitted. ""Thank you for the PSA,"" a third shared before another wrote, ""I actually did need to hear this."" ""me waiting on my candle order from bath and body works semi annual sale like ️️,"" someone else joked before a different viewer teased, ""But yankee candle is having a REALLY good sale right now!!"" Others opted to expand on the ""do not buy now"" list, adding chocolate (specifically the viral Dubai Chocolate Bars), along with plants or flowers, lava lamps, cosmetics, gummy candy or vitamins. Should you absolutely have to order a heat-sensitve product online during the summer, another candle seller recommended lining up your purchase so that it has the possibility of being packaged and shipped at the beginning of the week and ""not over the weekend,"" suggesting, ""They are much more likely to get there in time to not melt."" The type of wax used to make the candle may also have some sort of effect on how well they can hold up in the heat, with one more TikToker who identified their expertise as a candle maker said it can ""Depends on the candles and the company.""

Blame it on the huge selection, speedy shipping, and simple return process, but let's just say I put my Prime account to good use—especially when it comes to beauty products. Whether it's a TikTok-viral lip stain or a cult-classic Korean essence, I've placed more orders in the last year than I'd like to admit. At the time, it was bad news for my bank account, but now, it's good news for you because I know which Amazon beauty products are actually worth ordering, and right in time for Prime Day, too. This year, Prime Day deals are happening from July 8 to 11. During the sale, Prime members can score big discounts on thousands of products, including the best of the beauty category. Excited? Me too. Keep scrolling to see my official, beauty editor–approved shopping guide. Wonderskin Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain - Adore I have to start with a product I use almost every single day—Wonderskin's Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain. It went viral on TikTok a few months ago, and once I tested it, I could see why. Apply the dark-blue liquid to the lips (don't worry—it doesn't stay that way), wait a few minutes to let it dry, and peel it off. You'll be left with the most stunning, long-lasting lip color. You can stop there, or you can apply lip gloss over the top. I prefer the latter. It's become my go-to lip combo. Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water I can't tell you how many makeup artists and skincare experts have recommended Bioderma's Sensibio H2O Micellar Water to me. The classic French pharmacy product quickly and easily dissolves makeup, cleansing the skin without leaving behind even a hint of redness or irritation. Bondi Sands Self Tanning Foam Behold! The only self-tanner I've used consistently for over five years—Bondi Sands' Self Tanning Foam in Dark. It doesn't streak. It doesn't smell. It also features a bronze guide color, allowing you to see exactly where you're placing it and where you need to blend. I wear it overnight, and by the next morning, I have natural-looking, sun-kissed limbs. COLOR WOW Dream Coat Supernatural Spray I've always wondered how celebrities like Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian get such glossy hair on the red carpet. Well, as it turns out, the answer is Color Wow's Dream Coat Supernatural Spray. Read my full review to learn why it's such an underrated gem. COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence Snail mucin is the ultimate glass-skin ingredient. It's moisturizing, antioxidant-rich, and anti-inflammatory, so no wonder this iconic snail mucin essence blew up on the internet. It's the key to firm, bouncy, dewy skin. Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey Clinique's Almost Lipstick in Black Honey is so good. It was *the* lipstick for '90s starlets and supermodels. Everyone from Drew Barrymore to Courteney Cox and Julia Roberts wore it in the decade of slip dresses, grunge music, and mood rings. Cut to modern day, and it's still as beloved as ever. It recently had a resurgence on TikTokafter Gen Z became aware of its sheer formula and unique and universally flattering raisin-esque color. divi Scalp Serum..."

I found dozens that I'd personally add to my cart as a shopping writer and Prime member myself. Amazon Prime Day, aka the biggest sale of the year so far, is officially here. Prime members have four days (yes, four) to shop exclusive discounts across categories, including tech, beauty, home and kitchen, plus take advantage of limited-time promotions like Lightning Deals. And while hundreds of deals are available to shop right now, they're not all worthwhile — in fact, most aren't. As shopping editors, we get an advanced preview of the deals, so I spent the past few weeks combing through discounts to find the ones I think are actually worth adding to your cart. I've covered Prime Day for the past six years and in that time, I've perfected the deal hunting process. I look for items that are: 20% off or more, highly rated from hundreds of reviews and at its lowest price in at least three months. Every single deal I recommend below meets those qualifications, and I'll update this list live throughout Prime Day as more drop. Selected.Our top picks Out of all the teeth whitening strips we've tested, these are our favorite because they're easy to use and highly effective. Strips are coated in a layer of hydrogen peroxide to remove stains, and they're flexible, so they mold to the shape of your mouth. There's 44 strips in the box, which is enough for 22 treatments — 20 are 45-minute standard treatments, and two are 60-minute express treatments. Lowest Price Ever Track workouts, daily activity, sleep, health metrics like heart rate and more with this smartwatch. It's water-resistant, so you can swim with it, and it connects to your phone, letting you answer calls and texts. The watch's battery lasts for about 18 hours when it's fully charged, and 30 minutes in the included charger gives you about 80% battery, according to Apple. It's always a good idea to have extra batteries at home, especially to put in your emergency kit and power kids toys, remotes and flashlights. This pack comes with 32 AA alkaline batteries, which last up to 10 years if they're unused, according to the brand. This corded vacuum can clean dirt, pet hair and other messes on all floors in your home. It has a detachable pod and long nozzle, letting you clean hard-to-reach areas like above door frames, on stairs and under furniture. The vacuum is built with a HEPA filter to trap allergens like dust and pollen, and it comes with crevice and upholstery tools. LifeStraw's personal filter can remove over 99% of bacteria, parasites and microplastics from water, making it ideal to bring with you while camping or hiking, or pack in an emergency kit. The tool can filter up to 1,000 gallons of water before you need to replace it. It has a cap to protect the part you sip from, and a layard so you can put it around your neck. Lowest Price Ever The Dyson Airwrap simultaneously dries and styles your hair, letting you create curly, wavy and straight styles without causing heat damage, according to Dyson. It comes with three interchangeable attachments: a smoothing dryer, round volumizing brush and long barrel. The Airwrap also has a cool shot button. Dermatologists we've talked to say Differin Gel is one of the best acne treatments. It's an over-the-counter retinoid made with 0.1% adapalene, and it works best if you apply it to your entire face once daily, according to the brand. The Little Green Machine helps you get stains out of upholstered furniture, carpets, area rugs, car seats and more. It has two 48-ounce tanks to separate cleaning solution from dirty liquid, and the head on the end of its long hose lets you spray cleaner on messes, scrub and suction them. You get a bottle of Bissell's Oxy Formula with your purchase, as well as a tough stain tool, self-cleaning hose tool and spraying crevice tool. This Kindle gives you 12 weeks of battery life on a single charge, according to the brand, and it's thin and lightweight, making it easy to travel with. It also has a 7-inch glare-free screen and an adjustable warm light so you can clearly see text in any environment. The e-reader is water-resistant, too — you can use it at the beach, by the pool or in the bath without worrying about splashes. “I'm a devoted hardcover fan, but I still can't live without my Kindle,” says NBC Select editor Lindsay Schneider, who's used a number of Kindle models over the years, courtesy testing samples from Amazon. “It really is impossible to live without once you try it. It makes it a whole lot easier to read on the go and outside. The battery is quite impressive too, I feel like I never have to charge it.” You'll wake up with smooth, moisturized lips when you leave this mask on overnight, says NBC Select updates editor Mili Godio. “I use Laneige's lip mask on days when my lips are super dry and it makes my nighttime routine so much more luxurious,” she says. “My lips feel so soft after I apply it, and I love using the little included spatula.” The lip mask is made with hydrating ingredients like vitamin C, murumuru seed and shea butters, antioxidants and coconut oil. Lowest Price Ever See, hear and speak to visitors with Blink's Video Doorbell. It runs on AA batteries, has a two-year battery life and doesn't require wiring, according to the brand. The camera gives you a head-to-toe view when you livestream footage through the Blink app, which also sends you real-time notifications when it detects people at your door.

mov_407609FD1947183152B78CCC79AAE41E,2025-07-08 12:45:18,en,WEB,"  Prime Day kicked off today, so there are discounts to be had on Amazon.com on all kinds of items. One way to lock in savings for the future is to take advantage of the numerous third party gift cards that Amazon has put on sale, with many brands available for 10%-20% off or more. That includes DoorDash, Instacart, Lowe's, Lyft, Sephora (indirectly) and more. The Deal   Save on select third party gift cards from Amazon. Direct link to offer (our affiliate link)   Key Terms   Various limits/denominations. Quick Thoughts   There are some great deals available today, but you'll have to check the details for each eligible brand's gift card as they're all different. For example, you can save $10 on $50 worth of Bath & Body Works gift cards, get $20 off $100 of Lyft gift cards, $15 off $100 of Lowe's gift cards, etc. Those are all straight discounts, but there are some deals offering Amazon promo credit that'll expire in the coming months, so you'll want to have a plan to redeem those credits. Also note that some of the deals are for eGift cards, while others are for physical gift cards that'll be shipped to you. There are a few One4All/Choice gift cards listed in there too which can be exchanged for many different brands. The One4All eGift Card is giving $10 off on $100 of spend and can be redeemed for a wide range of brands including Home Depot. The One4All/Choice Fun & Fabulous brand can be exchanged for gift cards for brands including Sephora, Nordstrom, Victoria's Secret and more. Be aware that you don't have to buy the specific denominations to get the discount. For example, if a deal gives $20 off a $100 gift card purchase, you don't necessarily have to buy a $100 gift card. You could instead buy two $50 gift cards, four $25 gift cards, etc. If you're buying for personal use then it might not be worth buying several smaller denominations, but if you want to buy some as gifts (e.g. by stocking up on stocking stuffers for December), buying several smaller denominations could come in handy.

mov_8FD928424550B31A7F68CFB20C44D9CF,2025-07-08 12:45:18,en,WEB,"  Prime Day kicked off today, so there are discounts to be had on Amazon.com on all kinds of items. One way to lock in savings for the future is to take advantage of the numerous third party gift cards that Amazon has put on sale, with many brands available for 10%-20% off or more. That includes DoorDash, Instacart, Lowe's, Lyft, Sephora (indirectly) and more. The Deal   Save on select third party gift cards from Amazon. Direct link to offer (our affiliate link)   Key Terms   Various limits/denominations. Quick Thoughts   There are some great deals available today, but you'll have to check the details for each eligible brand's gift card as they're all different. For example, you can save $10 on $50 worth of Bath & Body Works gift cards, get $20 off $100 of Lyft gift cards, $15 off $100 of Lowe's gift cards, etc. Those are all straight discounts, but there are some deals offering Amazon promo credit that'll expire in the coming months, so you'll want to have a plan to redeem those credits. Also note that some of the deals are for eGift cards, while others are for physical gift cards that'll be shipped to you. There are a few One4All/Choice gift cards listed in there too which can be exchanged for many different brands. The One4All eGift Card is giving $10 off on $100 of spend and can be redeemed for a wide range of brands including Home Depot. The One4All/Choice Fun & Fabulous brand can be exchanged for gift cards for brands including Sephora, Nordstrom, Victoria's Secret and more. Be aware that you don't have to buy the specific denominations to get the discount. For example, if a deal gives $20 off a $100 gift card purchase, you don't necessarily have to buy a $100 gift card. You could instead buy two $50 gift cards, four $25 gift cards, etc. If you're buying for personal use then it might not be worth buying several smaller denominations, but if you want to buy some as gifts (e.g. by stocking up on stocking stuffers for December), buying several smaller denominations could come in handy. It looks like these aren't one-time only deals. Although you're limited to one discount per brand per order, it appears that you can get the discount again in a subsequent order.

n20bkck,2025-07-08 16:15:14,en,REDDIT,"  Ohhhhh, okay. Sorry about that. To me, fragrances don't have a gender, that's just marketing. But I did miss the part that you're a guy, I probably wouldn't have suggested Tea Rose - ha ha. Bath & Body Works does have men's fragrances and they are about $35. Although I don't know where you can smell them in person, the Lattafa line of fragrances is very affordable and has unisex and masculine fragrances. They are pretty long lasting and come in nice packaging. I got Khamra based on a recommendation from Reddit and was very happy - it's a gourmand sort of vanilla smell. Although I haven't smelled it, I imagine their Oud fragrances would read as masculine and they're only about $20 on Amazon right now."

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including T-Mobile US, Inc. (TMUS), AstraZeneca PLC (AZN) and Comcast Corp. (CMCSA). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today. You can see all of today's research reports here >>> Ahead of Wall Street The daily 'Ahead of Wall Street' article is a must-read for all investors who would like to be ready for that day's trading action.

You can read today's AWS here >>> Pre-Markets Mixed at Start of Prime Day, Awaiting Trade Deals Today's Featured Research Reports T-Mobile's shares have outperformed the Zacks Wireless National industry over the past year (+34.5% vs. +30.7%). The company is benefiting from industry-leading postpaid customer growth with a record-low churn rate. Its acquisition strategy has significantly strengthened its position in the wireless industry over the past few years. TMUS' 2.5 GHz 5G spectrum delivers superfast speeds and extensive coverage with signals that go through walls and trees. This boosts its competitive edge against companies that provide 5G networks controlled by the mmWave spectrum. However, owing to the stock's premium valuation, we believe investors should remain cautious as macroeconomic factors, market saturation, or economic downturns can significantly impact overvalued stocks like TMUS. Fierce competition is straining profitability. To lure customers from competitors, T-Mobile has launched several low-priced service plans for consumers. This has put pressure on profits. (You can read the full research report on T-Mobile here >>>) Shares of AstraZeneca have outperformed the Zacks Medical - Biomedical and Genetics industry over the year-to-date period (+7.7% vs. -2%). The company's key drugs like Lynparza, Tagrisso, Imfinzi and Fasenra should keep driving revenues. Its pipeline is strong, with pivotal late- and mid-stage pipeline data readouts lined up. AstraZeneca has also been engaged in external acquisitions and strategic collaborations to boost its pipeline. AstraZeneca believes it can post industry-leading top-line growth in the 2025-2030 period. However, potentially lower sales of Lynparza and Farxiga in China, the impact of Part D redesign on U.S. oncology sales and slowing sales of rare disease drugs are expected to hurt the top line in 2025. Estimates have declined slightly ahead of the Q2 earnings release. The company has a mixed record of earnings surprises in recent quarters. (You can read the full research report on AstraZeneca here >>>) Comcast's shares have underperformed the Zacks Cable Television industry over the year-to-date period (-3.1% vs. +4.2%). The company has been persistently suffering from video-subscriber attrition due to cord-cutting. Broadband prospects are suffering from increased competition from fixed wireless and fiber businesses. Theme Parks revenues declined due to lower revenues at domestic theme parks, driven by lower guest attendance, including the impact of the Hollywood wildfires. A leveraged balance sheet is a major concern for Comcast. Nevertheless, steady growth in Content & Experiences revenues driven by steady performances by Studios and Media segments is positive. Its streaming service, Peacock, has been a key catalyst in driving broadband sales. Decreasing programming & production costs bode well for CMCSA's profitability. Strong free cash flow generation ability is noteworthy. (You can read the full research report on Comcast here >>>) Other noteworthy reports we are featuring today include Entergy Corp. (ETR), Align Technology, Inc. (ALGN) and Universal Health Services, Inc. (UHS).

Bellavita Honey Oud, it's like a lighter version of Khamrah that can even be worn in the summer. It's less than $20 right now on Amazon. This would be my #1 choice if I could only have one spicy vanilla. Bath and Body Works Vanilla Romance smells great and the lotion will keep its scent all day. It layers gorgeously with any perfume that has a bit of spice. Rifaaqat and Lattafa Sehr are not to my liking. I bought both and they smell like gasoline. Rifaaqat turns into a cheap smelling musk after a few hours. Sehr has never made it that long before I had to wash it off. Lattafa Artisan Ethnique is spicy vanilla with a hint of rum. Nebras is an Ellish dupe. Paris Corner December Vanilla is a boozy vanilla patchouli bomb. I smelled it when I got it, and thought no way can I ever wear that, but it grew on me. It feels like being retro, tough and elegant all at the same time. Paris Corner Vanilla Mood is an interesting one. It doesn't smell like vanilla at first, more of a vaguely pleasant scent, then turns to a slightly leathery, sweet vanilla. Miim Miic 94 is a Kayali Vanilla 28 dupe. Miim Miic 108 and Khair Confection are Kayali vanilla candy rock sugar dupes. Both good, Confection is a bit better to me, plus the bottle is pretty."

I've always tried to make my place look presentable and nice for company (I don't even get that much company). But recently I feel like everything is kind of bland (I like that you used that, very fitting) and boring. I love books and Bath and Body works wallflower of all things gave me the idea to decorate and make my living room feel like a bookstore/cafe. From Tik Tok I found that I like a cottage vibe, so that's what I am going to do in the kitchen. I have a different theme or design idea for every room, and none of it goes together. And I don't care. I'm going to do what makes me happy. I've searched Pinterest, Amazon, and googled for ideas and items. I don't have the money to do it right away, so I'll save up and redecorate room by room until it's done."

As shopping editors, we get an advanced preview of the deals, so I spent the past few weeks combing through discounts to find the ones I think are actually worth adding to your cart. I've covered Prime Day for the past six years and in that time, I've perfected the deal hunting process. I look for items that are: 20% off or more, highly rated from hundreds of reviews and at its lowest price in at least three months.

The e-reader is water-resistant, too — you can use it at the beach, by the pool or in the bath without worrying about splashes. “I'm a devoted hardcover fan, but I still can't live without my Kindle,” says NBC Select editor Lindsay Schneider, who's used a number of Kindle models over the years, courtesy testing samples from Amazon. “It really is impossible to live without once you try it. It makes it a whole lot easier to read on the go and outside. The battery is quite impressive too, I feel like I never have to charge it.”..."

n27fx94,2025-07-09 16:56:57,en,REDDIT,"  Hey Pal, I think it's great you've come on here asking for help. That's the first step, right? You're actively doing something about this already. So I was exactly the same: I used to be a Chef and I would spend all of my time at work or out drinking with friends, especially during periods I didn't have a partner. I hated being alone. Then something really shit happened to my health after getting covid and I became chronically ill and then bedbound for a year and a half whilst navigating a horrible break up and family and friends leaving me because they didn't understand what was going on I wasnt well enough to watch TV, listen to audio books, even talk long enough for a proper conversation. I spent most of my time in a dark room with noise cancelling headphones and an eye mask on. I was FORCED to learn to be with myself to an extreme degree. It was like hell at the beginning, and I wouldn't wish it upon anyone (well, maybe Trump) ANYWAY this isn't meant to be a sob story or inspirational porn, but more passing on what I've learnt from that shit time to get to the point where I love spending time by myself now. I'm nowhere near recovered but I have a full life again with good friends and a lovely partner I met when I wasn't even looking for one. I spent years in therapy trying to find a way to be okay with being alone, to find that safe place inside myself. I thought it was an impossible goal, but now I can absolutely say I have gotten there. But it took time. The more time you spend with yourself, the easier it gets. It's all about forming a habit and normalising it, not setting expectations too high or punishing yourself for not being able to be consistent all the time. You need to have a lot of self compassion. For instance, dedicate some time each day to being alone with your thoughts. No distractions. You can be at home, sitting on a park bench, having a coffee, but no headphones or screen time. Think you can do an hour? Start off with half an hour. Or even 10 - 15 minutes to begin with if that's less scary. Plan something each week to just do for yourself: go see a film solo, a meal or coffee out, a super luxurious bath with salts and candles, a nice walk or meal with your favourite drink just because you can. Hey, you deserve it. If you can, try and do a meditation each day. Or just a couple of times a week to start. Factor it into your routine ie when you wake up. Even a 5 minute meditation is something. The Insight Timer app is free and has a lot of good ones. I recommend morning meditations, yoga nidra, self compassion ones, body scans etc. This will help you get used to just being present without having to do anything or be anything. It took me months of meditations and breathing exercises and stuff before I actually began to feel more comfortable inside my own head. I always rejected that kind of thing but holy fuck I'm annoyed at how much it works and I didn't know. Again though, it takes time. I'd also recommend reading bell hooks' book, All About Love. There's a GREAT quote in it that says “Knowing how to be solitary is central to the art of loving. When we can be alone, we can be with others without using them as a means of escape.” Also look into mindfulness exercises. They're really nice to do somewhere outside in nature too. Which is another thing, get out into nature when you can. With yourself or with friends. Go wild camping for a couple of days, swim in a lake/the sea, read in a park. Take food with you and plenty of water and just enjoy it. I know this all sounds a bit wishy washy but I can honestly tell you it saved my life. And I hope it can help you too. If you want an accountability buddy to encourage you to do these things I'm more than happy to help. It's not about trying to reach impossible standards, but just meeting yourself where you are and doing the best you can with what you have."

mov_0522E96E139AA0522DFE3CA3CAC0934C,2025-07-10 07:00:32,en,WEB,"  I've featured the 'City Tales' series of books from Oxford University Press on the blog a good number of times, and so I was very pleased to hear that they were bringing out an edition which focused on the city of Venice. If you've not come across these before, they feature short works or extracts based in or about a particular urban location, and they're always fascinating and beautifully presented. Venice is a place which always hypnotises, a city of beauty and decay, and the pieces in this volume certainly explore the setting from all angles. ""Venice Tales"" is compiled and edited by Katia Pizzi, with translations by Katherine Gregor and Howard Curtis; the series editor is Helen Constantine. The book opens with an earthy extract from Boccaccio's ""Decameron"" and already the contrast between the glory of the city and its more uncouth elements is on display, even at this early time of 1353! From 1787 comes an extract from the Italian memoirs of the playwright Goldoni; and the notorious Casanova is represented in a marvellous extract from ""The Story of My Life"" (1788) which recounts his daring escape from a Venice prison. I'd never considered reading his book, but was so taken with this piece that I may well have to explore it! We reject the Venice of foreigners, the market of antique forgers, magnet for universal snobbery, and imbecility, a bed collapsed under droves of lovers, a bejewelled hip bath for cosmopolitan courtesans, the greatest cesspit for passeism. (Marinetti) Not all of the pieces sing the praises of the city, however; and the futurist Marinetti launches into a manifesto against it from 1910, decrying the fact that it's so lost in the past and demanding a modernised, mechanised Venice - the mind rather boggles at the thought of that! Central to this volume, for me anyway, is an extract from one of my favourite books by one of my favourite writers - ""Invisible Cities"" by Italo Calvino (1972). Although the book is ostensibly not about Venice, but a vast array of cities described by the traveller Marco Polo, it nevertheless captures the elusive magic of the place from multiple angles. Truly, here all cities are Venice. Moving into the 21st century, this collection really comes into its own, gathering as it does a fascinating assortment of more modern pieces. These range from an extract from ""Venice is a Fish"" (Tiziano Scarpa; 2000) which explores the city in terms of the effect on your body parts to ""The Man Who Sleeps in Churches"" from 2007; this is a haunting story by Andrea Perin which features a protagonist who is pursued by the sound of bells and visions of collapsing bell towers. ""A Ghost in Venice"" (Guiseppe O. Longo; 2019) is an evocative piece which explores the emotions of a man who left his city, but returns in later life to an inherited property; in it, he confronts the man he might have become had he stayed. ""The Valleys of Venice"" (Giancarlo Gemin; 2022), which closes the book, is a moving look at the life of author's mother, an Venetian woman who moved to South Wales after WW2 to be with her husband who had gone there to work in the mines. She ended up in many ways caught between two cultures, never entirely comfortable in either, and this thoughtful piece reflects the situation of so many nowadays, displaced by wars and disputes. I have to highlight one particular entry in the collection which was hard-hitting for me. ""Venice is the Lagoon"" by Roberto Ferrucci (2015) is an eye opening piece revealing the damage which is being done to La Serenissima by tourism, in particular the hideously gigantic cruise ships which come into the lagoon. The environmental effects are horrific yet, despite regulations being put in place to prevent this, apparently the ships just keep on coming. Presumably, money trumps everything else... I was saddened by this story, as well as being reminded how uncomfortable I feel sometimes watching Susan Calman's programmes where she's off on massive cruisers. I may have to rethink my viewing habits a little. Those are some of the highlights of this collection, but really the whole book made absolutely fascinating reading; and it was particularly lovely to read Italian writers on the subject of Venice, as the place has inspired authors from all over the world. I *have* read dark tales about Venice (""Murder Most Serene"") as well as some glorious descriptions of the place (from Charles Dickens, particularly) and it's clear that both sides of the city are equally fascinating. ""Venice Tales"" is an wonderful anthology of works which highlight La Serenissima's dual nature and it makes excellent reading; it's a welcome addition to a fascinating series and highly recommended by me! (Review copy kindly provided by the publisher, for which many thanks. ""Venice Tales is out today.)"

n2f23ng,2025-07-10 19:20:50,en,REDDIT,"  That's a good question, but the answer is a little more complex. Everyone's pain threshold is different, and warts can behave very differently depending on their location. Some aren't painful at all, while others—especially plantar warts—can be extremely painful, particularly if they're near a nerve. It sounds like you might have one of the unlucky ones, and there's absolutely nothing wrong with having a lower tolerance for this specific type of pain—it can be sharp and persistent. That said, when treating at home, the most effective approach is to debride (shave down) the wart before applying acid. The goal is to get down to the living wart tissue, and you'll usually know you've reached it if you see a tiny pinpoint of bleeding—not a big drop, just a red dot. That's actually a good sign, though understandably unpleasant. If that level of pain is too much for you, I completely get it—it's not something everyone can tolerate. Just be aware that if you skip the debriding, the acid won't work as well and the treatment may drag on for months or even longer. If it's getting unmanageable, it's definitely worth considering a podiatrist. They have access to treatments that are often more effective. One example is cantharidin, commonly referred to as “Beetlejuice.” I want to be really clear about this: it is extremely painful—brutally so for many people. But it's also highly effective. In some cases, just one or two rounds can wipe out the wart completely. So while the treatment itself is very intense, it might be worth it compared to a year or more of slow, painful home treatments. At the end of the day, it's about what you can handle and what works best for you. There's no shame in choosing the path that minimizes your overall suffering. Have you seen my self treatment advice yet on this subreddit? I will paste it below just in case you have not. Pay particular attention to the linked video as it is a perfect demonstration of how to debride. Here's what you do: Start by getting a pedicure knife kit (reasonably cheap on Amazon and I don't see why it wouldn't work on different kinds of warts, not on the foot), eyebrow razors, and/or a scalpel. Do not file, buff, or exfoliate your wart with an emery board or pumice stone unless you want a constellation of mosaic warts all over your foot/area where your wart is. I also advise against using disposable files or sandpaper, as they too often result in inadvertently filing healthy skin along with the wart. This can lead to the introduction of wart cells to vulnerable exfoliated healthy skin, creating more warts. Also get some disposable gloves so they don't keep spreading as they are highly contagious. Daily- soak in hot water to soften the tissue, use the scalpel and knife kit to debride (search debride here if you are unsure what that means- it's like carefully shaving away the top dead layer) the wart ideally to the point of pin point bleeding if you can handle it (could be quite painful so listen to your body and do only what you are comfortable with). See the link below where a redditor uses an eyebrow razor and perfectly demonstrates how to debride. Debriding will help the acid to penetrate the living wart tissue making it more effective. Obviously, listen to your body. Some warts are far more painful than others. If it's too much to debride every day, it's ok. Also, make sure you aren't going overboard with how much you are debriding, it need not be a blood bath. Next,  apply treatment - I suggest either 40% SA like Wartstick or ACV, then bandage and wrap with duct tape to suffocate it. Do this every day if you can. This could take many months. Intermittently you can also use the over the counter wart freeze products to zap the warts (maybe once a week or two but be aware freeze products can be pricey). Also, supplements are a good idea- high quality multivitamin, Vit c, zinc, Vit A, and Tagamet (google it and then search “Tagamet and warts” on TikTok). Tagamet can be taken orally to help your body fight the wart and can also be used topically (watch the videos). Vitamin A can also be used topically (search this subreddit for more info). Most importantly- keep everything sterile and clean. Wash your hands a lot and keep warts wrapped, preferably with duct tape, so they don't spread more or cause your friends/family to get warts too. Please be aware that some warts are extremely treatment resistant and require more aggressive intervention others spread rapidly and aggressively. If you've been doing everything right for months with no improvement, it's time to make an appointment with a doctor (podiatrist if it's a plantar wart). Please be aware of your own body and any pre-existing conditions that could make the following treatment advice ill-advised for your body. https://www.reddit.com/r/Warts/s/7IWO3A85YE"

I'm into a lot of rock and heavy metal bands, and the percussion was always a thing that stood out for me! I just enjoy hearing how it supports other parts, like guitar, bass, vocals, etc. If the brand happens to be in your area, I got both those shirts from Spencer's! I can see why that would be your preferred piece of jewelry. . I'm sorry for your loss. I would wear my grandpas ring, but it's too big for my fingers, and happens to be fairly bulky, too. Mainly what I consider a piece of him with me. I go to Bath & Body Works for Halloween scents (mainly candles), and they have a good chunk scents that aren't based on those, like green apple, pumpkin, etc. There are some hit or miss though, usually the foods-based ones... Ah, that's also a fairly good drug to try out. Frankly, there's plenty I'd probably give a shot at if it didn't ultimately lead to addiction and destroying your body. I can see why baths are comforting, but I always just feel gross after taking one. Besides, showers are quite convenient and quick which I don't mind. Damn, always sucks to have piercings that don't heal right. I really tried with my industrial, but I was gaining keloids at the piercing sights. Met with a doctor about who said ""screw the piercing, that's your body rejecting it"", so I had to let that out Took me a while to gain the balls to scream!

I was wearing my mom's oversized water shoes though, so when I tried to step up onto a sidewalk, I tripped and busted my knee open. Managed to turn into a scar in the end. I've also 2nd degree sprained my pinky finger through a missed hit in dodgeball. . that was fun I don't wear glasses, but I've been considering getting some since I'm noticing some struggle to read things from afar. Not great with some road signs since by the time I read them, I'm already blasting past the turn My best joints are always in my back. I do a tire twist, and I always get some relief and a decent pop from my spine Hydrapeak is my water bottle, holds a lot of water and ice which I like, although it's not the greatest for cup holders... Ooh, I enjoy true crime quite a bit. I don't watch it too often, but I like a good story every now and then The biggest pain I've been in is likely whenever I was on my period before having an IUD. . there were days I would be rocking on a bed or on a couch in pain, and damn near vomited from it more than once. Hell, I was able to even jokes while getting my IUD inserted since I was already used to the pain. Was a surprise for my Gyno, who said there's been some women who pass out getting it inserted Definitely more of a local chain, but Dutch Bros! I see Shadow People more often than I'd like to admit. . I see something out of the corner of my eye that appears to be pitch black just about every other day.

1lx9zat,2025-07-11 15:33:48,en,REDDIT,"  Just wanted to hop on here and share my story with scabies in order to help others possibly recover as well. I would like to note I am not a doctor. However, my girlfriend is in life science and we've done numerous readings on everything about scabies after our diagnosis. I recommend following a physicians advise. There are some very important things to understand about Scabies in general that i'll talk about first and then a timeline of events. * MITE LIFE CYCLE * The mites can be active where they crawl on your body, this is when they can lay eggs. * They create burrows that appear as bumps, wavy tiny white lines. * UNDERSTANDING THEIR LIFE CYCLE * Mites eggs take 3-4 days to hatch and about a week to mature * Larvae cannot reproduce immediately * When you take treatment (I recommend NOTHING but Ivermectin and Prometherin) ensure you understand these life cycles. Treating on Day 1,2,3,4 is over treating yourself and will cost money. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THE CLEANING! DO NOT SKIP THIS! * BAG ALL YOUR CLOTHES * STEAM CLEAN PILLOWS * **ENCASE YOUR MATTRESS IN A PLASTIC COVERING** I emphasized these points in all caps because you cannot skip this. If you do you will not treat yourself and environment I can guarantee it. You don't have to remove everything or be excessive about cleaning past the first couple nights, just make sure your throughly clean everything for the first two nights and again on the seventh when you take another round of treatment. Treating with two people * This is very difficult, if you can avoid it do not sleep together for a week * This is tough but genuinely it helps so much. I would not recommend sleeping together at all it can cause the mites to move back and forth especially if you're sleeping skin to skin. General Timeline I got scabies from my university couch in January 2025, I had it until June 2025. It is very important to try to have a strong mental state, the mites can drive you insane (as they did with me). I highly recommend anti-histamines every single night you can (I used Claritin). Just take one two is not needed. * It took the doctors two months to properly diagnose scabies it is very difficult to spot esepcially early on. * Honestly, if anyone has had it around you I highly recommend treating yourself with the cream as soon as possible to avoid any potential concerns. * When I finally found out I had scabies I took the treatment along with my girlfriend I used ivermectin and she used the cream * big NONO, Ivermectin works differently than prometherin. If you're treating two people treat with the exact same thing (I recommend Ivermectin and prometherin at the same time) * Do not hesitate to demand things from your doctor that's what I had to do. * Throughout February-June we went through multiple incomplete treatments * Please ensure you treat yourself while taking care of your environment or else active mites will survive * You need to treat on day 1 and day 7. * If your case is persistent ask the doctor for ivermectin if it's available. Take the ivermectin that's dosed to your body weight on days 1,2 and 8,9. Why you make ask? This is because ivermectin's half-life is 12-56 hours meaning if you take it Day 1 and Day 2 you you have a higher dose of ivermectin in your body about 1.5x. This is safe in crusted scabies cases they use almost 2x a persons body weight. Things I learned Treat yourself day 1 and 7 if your case isn't persistent If you case is persistent ask for both ivermectin and premetherin on Day 1,2 and 8,9. (This is what I did) Ensure your environment is clean, mattresses covered in plastic, couches, bath mats removed, try not to touch anything for a few days, bag all the clothes you don't need and put the clothes you need in a bin, freeze your shoes (yes you read that right), they will die in a cold environment and this is what I did because I needed my work shoes the next day.

2fc0825bbc71d0329f00efaddc0da417,2025-07-11 19:32:00,en,WEB,"  Glendale couple, delivery driver arrested in connection with organized retail theft ring Jul 11, 2025, 12:32 PM PHOENIX — Three people, including a married couple, were arrested for their alleged involvement in a Valley-based organized retail theft ring, authorities announced Thursday. The operation allegedly trafficked over $350,000 in stolen merchandise, according to the Phoenix Police Department. In addition, the group is suspected of similar crimes in Texas and Nevada, police said. A Glendale husband and wife — Nephtali Santiago-Garcia and Yuli “Nissy” Degante-Vigueras – are accused of being the primary sellers for the organized retail theft ring. How did Glendale couple allegedly run organized retail theft ring? They allegedly turned their living room into a storefront for $160,000 in products mostly stolen from Bath & Body Works locations. Police said they fenced stolen merchandise at least 17 times from April 2023 to April 2024. The couple was arrested on April 9, 2025, and booked on counts of theft, fraudulent schemes, illegal control of an enterprise and trafficking in stolen property. The ongoing investigation led to Marcos Ortega Hernandez, a driver for a trucking company that delivered products to retailers such as Bath & Body Works, Old Navy, Victoria's Secret, Gap and Banana Republic. He allegedly was paid over $72,000 to divert about $200,000 worth of merchandise to the Glendale couple so they could sell it. Hernandez was arrested June 26 after police served a search warrant at his home and found stolen items. He was booked for fraudulent schemes and trafficking in stolen property. Organized retail theft is a growing problem in metro Phoenix. The number of cases the Maricopa County Attorney's Office received almost doubled in 2024 compared to the year before.

mov_DF53E2F6C928895203B204C69E8878E8,2025-07-12 01:45:00,en,WEB,"  It is a truth universally acknowledged that a zombie in possession of brains must be in want of more brains. Published a little over a century after its source of inspiration, Seth Grahame-Smith's Pride and Prejudice and Zombies (2009) retains the original characters and narrative but replaces some discussions of yearly allowances and the size of estates with talk of katanas and the undead. While we cannot be sure what author Jane Austen (1775-1817) would have made of the Bennet sisters getting trained by Shaolin monks, as one Goodreads review puts it: “Fans will either think this book is brilliant or are already setting fire to Seth Grahame-Smith's lawn.” As Janeites around the world celebrate the Regency author ahead of her 250th birthday this December, her modest but mighty body of work has not only endured, but evolved, lending itself to myriad adaptations, spin-offs, memes and even counting books for toddlers (two rich gentlemen, five sisters, and so on). In all likelihood, you would have first encountered Austen in the classroom or because an adult in your life wanted you to be 'well read'. I first heard of her when a slightly older, much cooler family friend confidently told me that “Just as every man can quote from The Godfather, every woman can quote from Pride and Prejudice.” It was a while before I realised what an untrue and gendered statement that was, but I forgave her. After all, she had introduced me to Austen. 250 years of Jane Austen: what to do to get your Austen fix 250 years of Jane Austen: what to do to get your Austen fix | Video Credit: The Hindu The statement set me off in search of the book. I still remember the look of surprise on the face of Pazhani, the proprietor of Easwari Lending Library in Chennai, when I handed it over to him to check out. Up until that moment, my main preoccupation in life was keeping the many rows of Mills & Boons in steady rotation. Rare copies of the first edition of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice. | Photo Credit: Life-altering legacy People dressed in period costume take part in the annual Jane Austen Festival in Bath, England. | Photo Credit: It was with the intent of keeping her away from such romance novels that Radhika Sathe Mantri's mother steered her towards Austen. The special educator and co-founder of Cosy Nook Library in Bengaluru is a self-proclaimed super fan, and remembers her mother saying, “Here is something that will change your life.” “And it did,” she says. Radhika Sathe Mantri, special educator and co-founder of Cosy Nook Library in Bengaluru, is an Austen super fan. Mantri has been 'obsessed' with the writer and her body of work since then, reading and rereading the novels and watching all the adaptations. “I even sat down and annotated my copy of Pride and Prejudice while watching the 1980 BBC version starring David Rintoul as Mr. Darcy. Did you know it's the closest to the original text? The Colin Firth one is quite massified,” she says, quickly adding that she still loves it. A still from the 1995 Pride and Prejudice TV drama, starring Colin Firth and Jennifer Ehle. Nidhi Bhandari, an undergraduate student, first made an attempt at reading the classics when she was 12. “I started with Moby Dick but I couldn't relate to it at all,” she tells me. “But when I read Austen, all the day-to-day matters of life that are usually dismissed — friendship, finding love, and gossip — she treated all of these seriously, validating them for me and my friends.” This need for validation is something that came up in my conversation with writer, translator, and critic Meenakshi Bharat. The retired professor taught Austen to Honours students at Sri Venkateswara College, University of Delhi, for many years. Writer, translator, and critic Meenakshi Bharat “Amongst my undergraduate students, the girls would instinctively take to Jane Austen, but the boys would smile and stay silent. If I asked them what they thought about it all, they would respond that the heroes looked silly. It appeared initially, as if going along with the 'romance' went against their 'male' instincts,” she tells me over a Zoom interview. Bharat has a keen interest in film adaptations and started using them as a way to bring her students closer to Austen's work. She says, “When we watch Gurinder Chadha's Bride and Prejudice (2004), which transposes Austen to an Indian milieu, they feel 'okay, this is my world'. And they start seeing that Austen has relevance to their lives; that she has something significant to say about life's choices at the personal and social levels; that her works give direction in this globalised scenario; that her directions are emotionally, socially and economically sound. That's validation!” Money and marriage still matter Some of us arrive at Austen's work through these adaptations, without even realising they are based on her books. Bhandari recalls reading Emma and feeling a jolt of recognition. “I had seen Clueless (1995) and Aisha (2010), and not realised they were based on a book at the time.” A still from Aisha (2010), an adaptation of Jane Austen's Emma. Clueless, which turns 30 this year, came up in my conversation with novelist Mahesh Rao, whose Polite Society sets Emma in Lutyens' Delhi. “Clueless is so sharp and clever in the way it transposes Austen to Beverly Hills. There's really no one more obsessed with popularity and who is in and who is out than high school students,” he says...."

It's important that you and your wife give each other grace to grieve the way you each need to. I'm a child life specialist and talk with kids of all ages about death of siblings and other family members. It's important at her age to use the word “died”, even though that may seem odd to do, and giving a simple, concrete explanation will help. Something like “everyone has a heart that works hard to make their body work, but your sister's heart stopped so her body didn't work anymore and she died.” Three-year-olds don't really have a concept of death and its finality so it's totally normal for her to not be sad for long (or at all), but you can tell her that you/her mom are sad that she died so she may see you crying and that's okay. It can also help to keep her routine as “normal” as you can (still going to daycare, bath/bedtime, etc.). There's a couple books called “We were gonna have a baby, but we had an angel instead” and “The Invisible String” that I've used with siblings and you can order on Amazon."

1lyd0zb,2025-07-12 22:32:58,en,REDDIT,"  Follow if you wish. I plan to update this a couple times, final update will be after how long it takes me to match my yearly rewards I was receiving using the Costco Mastercard(cool thing is you can change your Costco renewal to any Mastercard/visa through your Costco online account) So here's my plan. I used codes for a $25 account credit and $100 reimbursement. I plan to keep this out of my calculations, I removed the $25 reward from my rewards balance already. I subscribed to “perks premium” for $9.99/month which boosts the cash back to Gas 5% Groceries 7% Recurring payments 4.5% Everything else 1.5% It can be boosted further by having a balance in a checking account with them, this I am not doing as their checking account interest rate is only 0.1% Essentially the annual cost for the card plus perks will be $245. My previous year Costco rebate was just under $400. My plan is to see how long it takes to get to a rewards rebate of $645. See if this card really is worth it. I believe the extra .5% on everything else alone will pay for itself, we shall see. This is 100% for educational purposes to provide insight if this card is truly as advertised. If you do decide to use this card, you can message me for a code. However my intentions here are not to shill this card, I found very little real information on this card when I started. **1 Month Update** I decided to also factor in comparing against the Roger's Mastercard, if I average $2000/month spending and my rewards are above 4% average the Neo will still be the better card for me So here's what I have found one month in **Grocery Category (7%):** Walmart Supercenters (Walmarts with grocery, includes cosmetics) Real Canadian Superstore Save on Foods **Recurring Payments (4.5%):** Square One Home insurance Shaw Internet Bill Microsoft Gamepass Bchydro (Through Paymentus, charges 1.75% fee so gain 2.75% here) **Gas (5%):** Petro Canada Gas Stations with liquor stores inside of the will give you the 5% on liquor also which is neat, I don't drink much though **Everything Else (1.5%)** Taxi, Ferries, Fastfood Dentist Office Costco Bath and Body Public Mobile Bills (counts as a top up, not a recurring bill, bonus 5% for $$ spent at public mobile so works out to 6.5%) Amazon Dollar Tree KMS Tools Fortis BC recurring payments (through Kubra, counts as one time payment) Shoppers Drug Mart I also tried 3 of their “partner offers” this is where I was disappointed They have requirements such as “instore” or “App” purchase, which I followed, of the 3 partner bonuses only one worked as it should. The other two I did the automated “missing rewards” feature which after 10 business days the review came back and my rewards were denied, I then called the premium support line, and had a great experience with customer service, from the time I dialed to finished the call it was 20 minutes, he took all the info required, and my bonus rewards were added next day. I just wish they would have remained automated. Additionally I have bought a $500 debit Mastercard from Walmart where I received 7% rewards for the purchase to be used online and at Costco. The fee for the card was $8.90 with tax or roughly 1.8% still giving me 3.72% extra at anywhere that is 1.5% So where am I at after one month. After removing the additional fees from the Debit Mastercard and Bchydro my average rewards are 4.62% for now I am very happy with that. I suspect the % may fall slightly as I did take advantage of some bonus promos. I plan my next update after roughly 3 months with the card, followed by 6 months, then one year...."

You have just as much right as anyone to feel down/anxious. Secondly, do things that make you happy or relaxed. For me, I take a bath with the works, epson salt, bath bomb, candles, a glass of wine, etc. I tense up when I'm stressed so it relaxes my muscles and I smell nice afterwards! Thirdly, do the basics. The three most important things to keep your body and mind healthy is eat, sleep, and exercise. Being consistent with these will do loads for you. I like walks with an audio book and I make sure to have easy meals when I have trouble making food and ones that take more prep for when I feel good. Don't let anyone tell you that your feelings are invalid cause you didn't go through something “as bad” as someone else. You got this!

mov_66BD69729AD155FFC2A5FFE6964E3456,2025-07-13 18:02:00,en,WEB,"  To Pemberley and Beyond: A Traveller's Guide to England by the Bennets, Darcys, and Their Many Friends by Quincy Christian Alexander, Celestial Publishing Co., & Princeton Studios A couple of months ago Princeton Studios reached out me about their book, To Pemberley and Beyond, being available free on Amazon kindle for five days. They also asked me to read and review it. I promised I would… Just kidding! They didn't have to wait that long! I did plan to post this sooner but I had other promised reviews and then life got in the way. But here it is, finally. When I read the title of the book, I missed the part on the bottom that it was written by the Bennets and Darcy's; along with their family and friends. I expected it to be an actual travel guide, but then opened it up. It contains about 60 short essays about the Regnecy era written by the Bennets, Bingleys, Darcys, Collinses, de Bourgs, Phillips, Gardiner, etc. Almost every family member writes something. It's interesting because this is kind of like a hybrid of genres; it has factual information about the Regency Era, but each one is “told” by a fictional character. I would definitely recommend this for Jane Austen fans who are interested in learning more about the culture and society the Pride and Prejudice characters lived in that isn't written in a textbook way. This is especially perfect for those who struggle reading nonfiction or avoid them. Some of the essays are written a little too well; the ones by Mr. Collins were very entertaining but also very flowery, pompous, and he could have definitely said the same thing in less words. It was a perfect representation! I really enjoyed the essays on ladies clothing, although my kindle edition had some drawing that were intact and then others that had portions missing, I'm not sure if that was a “printer's error” or if that was how the image was supposed to be. For instance some images look like this: But then others like this: But that is my only real complaint (that and I did spot a reference to Robert Lewis Stevenson who wasn't born before 1813). In “From Morning Calls to Royal Galas: The Proper Wardrobe for a Society Lady in London” by Louisa Hurst she mentions that women should wear “a delicate scent, such as rose or bergamot.” I can't wear perfume because I'm sensitive to smells, but when I read this I thought I love Earl Grey Tea, I would love to have bergamot as my personal scent. Then yesterday, I went shopping at Bath and Body Works for hand sanitizer, and discovered they have a whole Lavender and Bergamot line. They also have a Rose and Ivy line, so if you are looking for bergamot or rose they have you covered. I bought the hand sanitizer so now I too can have a “delicate scent.” I also enjoyed the essay “How to Host a Proper Ball” by Mrs. Bennet. This composition details all that goes into planning a ball from food, to lighting, to entertainment. This part also stood out to me: “Nothing flatters a young lady's complexion more than the soft glow of candlelight. What is a ball if not an occasion to shine?” It reminded me of what Fran Fine always says in The Nanny about the best lighting being candles, sunset, and moonlight. Emma (1996) I also really enjoyed “The Rhythm of a Country Day: A Guide to Social Customs” by Jane Bennet Bingley which offers a view into what an average day would be like for someone on the social scale of the Bennets in 1813 England. I love tea, so of course I loved reading “Steeped in Tradition: History and Varieties of English Tea” by Jane Bennet Bingley. This was a great read as it went over the brief history of tea being brought to England, the type of teas that people drank, and the custom of “tea time”. “…tea serves as both an introduction and an invitation. It is a moment to pause amidst the bustle of the day, to savour not only the beverage but the company and the ritual itself. Whether you find yourself enjoying a smoky Bohea, a refreshing Hyson, or a delicate Young Hyson, may your experience of tea offer both comfort and delight…” Reading it made me want to prepare myself a pot of tea. So I did. It was a fun read and a perfect addition to any Jane Austen fan's collection.

1lzd7cf,2025-07-14 04:31:45,en,REDDIT,"  I am absolutely enamored by how Bath and body Works does their aquatic fragrances. If you are familiar with “underwater oasis”, “endless sea”, and “sea salt coast” then you'll understand what I mean. They're delicate but still gorgeous. Most smell similar and usually have notes like water lily, musk, and water. Every time I try to find expensive aquatic fragrances they almost always have a strong salt note or something else off putting. I am just not a fan of harsh fragrance especially during the summer. I would just use the bath and bodywork's fragrances but those don't last. Help! Please and thank you."
