根據智研諮詢報告，自疫情以來，中國大陸消費者對價格越來越敏感，也間接助推了二手奢侈品市場的成長。 雖然市場規模在成長，但本質卻是來自「壓力型消費」，不是炫耀性消費。 專家也指出，這樣的消費模式轉變，是中國大陸當前經濟結構轉型下的縮影。 再從宏觀數據來看，中國大陸5月份的CPI年減0.1%，顯示出家庭需求疲弱，而產能卻持續過剩。 這種「價格戰主導市場」的現象，不只存在於精品產業，也蔓延至汽車、電商、甚至咖啡市場。 資本經濟公司（Capital Economics）警告，中國大陸若持續陷於通縮與價格戰，將可能面臨企業倒閉與失業潮惡化的風險，形成難以扭轉的通縮循環，而奢侈品「崩價」現象，正是冰山一角。 （封面示意圖／東森新聞）

Neither folkloric nor classic, Kaia Gerber's red polka-dot dress was almost striking enough to overshadow two equally significant details. The actor is currently sporting the thinnest eyebrows she has ever worn, which, together with her new hair color, represent a new phase in her beauty aesthetic. And then there are her shoes. When she takes a break from heels, Kaia Gerber prefers the comfort of Converse, Birkenstocks, Adidas, and ballet flats, and although she has occasionally worn velvet ballet pumps, she usually opts for more classic flat models. Her favorite is without a doubt the Cendrillon (the French name for Cinderella) by Repetto, which, on rare occasions, she has swapped for the Camille model, which has a tiny block heel. The casual, girlish Camille in white is the perfect finishing touch for this new style era. This article first appeared on Glamour Spain. The post appeared first on Glamour."

The Duchess of Sussex made her Trooping the Colour debut in June 2018, a month after marrying Prince Harry in a lavish London ceremony, in a look that breached royal protocol. In case you need a refresher, Meghan donned a pastel pink Carolina Herrera ensemble, which included the iconic asymmetric silhouette. However, she broke a major royal rule: no off-the-shoulder looks at major royal events.

Harry Duke of Sussex and Meghan Duchess of Sussex. Photo by Mike Marsland/Mike Marsland/WireImage. Mike Marsland/WireImage As you can see, Meghan looked absolutely radiant on that day and nailed the unofficial pastel-colored dress code. However, this royal protocol rule-breaking shocked many. Bethan Holt even told The Telegraph at the time that Meghan's look “will be compiled on her own terms. Hers is a 21st-century take on elegance that looks as pristine as is expected in her new royal role, but which also pushes some of the unspoken rules of the regal dress code.” The British royal family has a lot of dress code rules: no off-the-shoulder looks, you can't show your knees, nail polish has to be natural looking, wearing clutches in certain hands, and more, per Cosmopolitan. Now, obviously, Meghan isn't the first to break the off-the-shoulder rule. Back on July 19, 2017, when she donned an off-the-shoulder red gown from Alexander McQueen at The Queen's Birthday Party, and Diana donned this trend numerous times as a royal. Meghan then arrived at 2019 Trooping the Colour; she donned a dark navy ensemble from Clare Waight Keller of Givenchy, along with a fascinator by Noel Stewart, mere months after welcoming her son, Archie, per What Meghan Wore. By the time Trooping the Colour returned from its 2020 and 2021 hiatus, Meghan and Harry had relocated to the US after leaving the Royal Family, and amid an ongoing feud with Prince William and King Charles, the couple will not make their return this year. Per People, the couple are not invited to the festivities for a third year in a row. Before you go, click here to see the 100 best photos of the royal family from the past 20 years."

The policy states they will only price match if it's an Amazon listing shipped and sold by Amazon, which it was. I wanted to do the price match instead of buying directly from Amazon because I was concerned about authenticity. (Mods, this is not a legit check I'm just giving context and my opinion.) I won't link but it's the first result if you search it in Amazon; it felt scammy to me because the color of the box looked weird and it was listed as 2.5 fl oz and the real size is 2.7.

mov_B29FB18945F3A1626A3B810B7338DC03,2025-06-14 07:47:59,en,WEB,"  The Truce is one of the most evocative tales told about World War 1. New evidence shows Indians participated too, laying down arms to exchange tokens with enemy soldiers. On December 24, 1914, amid the bloodshed and chaos of the Great War, peace unexpectedly broke out along the Western Front. Spontaneously and without official sanction, troops on both sides observed a series of ceasefires, setting aside their weapons and exchanging gifts and souvenirs in no man's land. Joint burials and unsanctioned prisoner swaps were carried out. There was carolling, and even some impromptu football. The spontaneous reaching out was named the Christmas Truce and celebrated in newspaper reports of the time as a sign of our enduring humanity. It would not be repeated, as the war tore on, but it would become one of the most storied events of World War 1. Now, new evidence is uncovering how that great force within the Allied forces — the mass of Indian soldiers — participated in the truce too. The key piece of evidence has turned out to be spice tins handed out to Indians on the front, as part of Princess Mary's Christmas Gift initiative, found later in the possession of German soldiers. Some of this tale was retold in an exhibition held at the Great War Huts Museum in Suffolk, England, where one such tin was also placed on display. We know these tins were from Indian soldiers fighting in the British army because of their contents. Most British troops received a Christmas box that contained cigarettes, a pipe, other smoking supplies and a signed card. The boxes made up for Indians avoided most of these items, since smoking is taboo among several communities. Instead, these boxes held candy, cigarettes  except for the Sikh troops , a signed card, and, rather ironically, spices. In a greater irony, while the soldiers did receive the boxes, it is worth mentioning that they received little else. There was little recognition of their service during the war, or in the decades that followed. Indians were also steadily discriminated against while they served, in a trend that would continue through World War 2. Back to the Christmas Truce, “it is fascinating because it reflects a sense of humanity in the depth of this really horrific time,” says Peter Doyle, a military historian with Goldsmiths, University of London, who curated the exhibition in Suffolk. “To have Indian troops also take part in the truce has huge implications. We have evidence of these men from different continents, German and Indian, in no man's land, sharing experiences, and sharing whatever they had.” The Tata connection The story of how the boxes came about has become a bit of history in itself. A total of 2.5 million were dispatched  incidentally, about 5 million British soldiers went into battle, across the four years . It took immense fundraising and organisation to make the gift a reality, particularly in the midst of the war, Doyle says. He traces some of that effort in his 2021 book, For Every Sailor Afloat, Every Soldier at the Front. The effort began with a letter from the then-17-year-old princess published across Britain's major newspapers, announcing her intention to send a Christmas present “from the whole nation to every sailor afloat and every soldier at the front”. As donations poured in, a high-ranking committee was set up, to decide on the nature of the gift, and, with trademark British efficiency, dispatch enough that no soldier was left wanting. There was reportedly plenty of deliberation on what to give the Indian men. At one point, records show that the Parsi industrialist and philanthropist Ratanji Tata  1871-1918; son of Tata Industries founder Jamsetji Tata  was consulted. A quiet retelling Determined to learn more about this story within the story, Doyle began digging into the history of the Indian soldiers' Christmas exchange. He knew, for instance, that the 39th Garhwal Rifles was stationed in Givenchy, France, in December 1914, and wondered whether there was any further evidence lurking there. He approached a friend, the German historian Robin Schafer, who dug into archives in Germany and found references in newspapers of the time that confirmed what Doyle had suspected. “The Garhwal Rifles met in no man's land with members of Germany's 16th Westphalian regiment and exchanged gifts,” he says. “It was recorded in German newspapers at the time that one of the things exchanged was a shiny tin full of Indian spices.” It is strange to think of the young Garhwals, feared for their skill in battle, stepping across to extend a hand in peace, on a festival not even their own. “There was a general sense of respect and fear that went with meeting Indian soldiers,” says Doyle. “So the opportunity to do that in no man's land and see what they were like, see the warmth of engagement during that truce, must have been something spectacular.” Doyle says he hopes this discovery will add to the growing discourse and serve as a further reminder of the “intense engagement” of Indian troops on the Western Front. Records indicate that over 74,000 Indians died in battle during World War 1. In all, undivided India sent over 1 million troops to fight in the war."

Cristian Jerez se manisfestó al respecto en sus redes sociales: ""Ni los buenos son tan buenos ni los malos son tan malos. Pd: y por los 985.478.954 cuernos que le ha puesto él a ella, digo yo... Para nada me alegro, todo lo contrario. ¡Nadie se merece que le hagan eso!"" , fueron sus palabras. A los meses de su ruptura con Melodie Peñalver, el amor llamó de nuevo a su puerta. Cristian Jerez anunció en sus redes sociales que había iniciado una relación sentimental con Emmy Russ, influencer alemana y concursante de 'Secret Story', con la que inundó su feed de posados románticos, escapadas a países exóticos y cenas a la luz de las velas. Sin embargo, el mismo Cristian Jerez confesó que a pesar del amor que se tenían, había bastantes discusiones entre ellos que desgastaron poco a poco la relación. De este modo, Cristian y Emmy rompieron con su relación tras más de un año de noviazgo, en febrero de 2023. Toda la actualidad de Telecinco en Google NewsSuscríbeteCristian explica el motivo por el que ha dejado de seguir a Emmy Desde entonces, no se han conocido detalles de la vida sentimental del valenciano ni ha compartido contenido en sus redes sociales acompañado de un nuevo amor. Ahora, el influencer está centrado en sí mismo y en su trabajo en hostelería para el Grupo Meneo, una cadena de restaurantes en Alicante, y en viajar a países como México o Tailandia rodeado de amigos. La influencer sufrió un fuerte varapalo que marcó un antes y después en su vida. En agosto de 2023, Melodie Peñalver sufrió un accidente de tráfico múltiple en plena autovía, su vehículo quedó siniestro total y ella sufrió graves contusiones en el cuerpo y tres fracturas diferentes en el brazo izquierdo. La misma influencer relató los hechos desde la cama del hospital en sus redes sociales donde aseguró que los culpables de la colisión se dieron a la fuga. ""Fue en la autovía. Un accidente múltiple. Los culpables se dieron a la fuga. Yo apenas me acuerdo después de que saltaran los airbags. Solo se que me vi el brazo colgando y que no paraba de gritar del dolor"", confesó la influencer que posteriormente tuvo una recuperación favorable. Este episodio cambió la forma de ver la vida para Melodie Peñalver y comenzó a relativizar las cosas en su entorno. La influencer se centró en su trabajo como creadora de contenido donde ha sabido hacerse un hueco entre los rostros más conocidos del país, y acude con frecuencia a eventos destacados y alfombras rojas como los Premios Ídolo, los Forbes Best Content Creator o en la Madrid Fashion Week. Además, sigue adelante con su trabajo como modelo posando para firmas de la altura de Guess o Givenchy Beauty. En cuanto a su vida sentimental, Melodie Peñalver ha comentado públicamente que comparte su vida con un nuevo amor. Después de Beltrán, comenzó a salir con un chico anónimo llamado José Luis, un romance que destapó 'La cuernis' y que ella misma confirmó en 'Un cuento imperfecto' de mtmad. Se trata de un joven aspirante a policía que no tiene intenciones de dar el salto a la televisión. ""Estoy ilusionada, pero él no pertenece a todo esto"", comentó Melodie sobre su chico con quien no comparte imágenes en sus redes sociales preservando su intimidad."

1lbn47p,2025-06-15 00:16:00,en,REDDIT,"  I'm 16 and I've been working seriously toward becoming a fashion designer. I've always felt more drawn to clothing that feels like a story something emotional, kind of spiritual, but not in a loud or preachy way. I'm really inspired by pieces that feel worn in some surreal or sacred world, like something you'd wear at the end of the world but still feel graceful in. My main inspirations are Rick Owens (especially late 2000s/early 2010s), Hedi Slimane's Saint Laurent, Boris Bidjan Saberi, PHI, Julius, and Givenchy around 2007–2009. I also really love Alber Elbaz's Lanvin — there's something about the balance between elegance and structure in his work that stuck with me. Also Balmain when Decarnin was there. i'm also very inspired by music. artist like grouper that have a depressing, dark, almost hallucinogenic sound and beach house with their hypnotizing melodic songs. and let me clarify that i've never made a single piece of clothing in my life. i just draw. and my drawings have very exaggerated skinny models. but i can't shade or color lol. n if u don't know what's going on in the pic or can't tell what the pieces are i'll be more than happy to explain them to u :-) A lot of the pieces I've been sketching lately use long, slim silhouettes, military or armor like jackets, leather (u can't tell it's leather obvs but it's in the idea yk?) and fur textures, and this idea of layering softness under structure. One design has a featherlike fur detail coming out of a sleeveless piece worn under a more rigid jacket. I'd love your thoughts — even if it's constructive criticism: •Does this kind of aesthetic come across in the sketches? •Do the ideas feel too all over the place or kind of unified? •Any advice on how to develop this direction further? Thanks for taking the time to read this. I'm still learning a lot, and I want to grow in the most intentional way I can. Any thoughts at all are super appreciated. - Kepka"
mov_086CC48109010B5FEE38F2DB7D9F1E21,2025-06-15 04:46:01,en,WEB,"  India, June 15 -- On December 24, 1914, amid the bloodshed and chaos of the Great War, peace unexpectedly broke out along the Western Front. Spontaneously and without official sanction, troops on both sides set aside their weapons and exchanged gifts and souvenirs in no man's land. Joint burials and unsanctioned prisoner swaps were carried out. There was carolling, and even some impromptu football. The spontaneous reaching out was named the Christmas Truce and celebrated in newspaper reports of the time as a sign of our enduring humanity. It would not be repeated, as the war tore on, but it would become one of the most storied events of World War 1. Now, new evidence is uncovering how that great force within the Allied forces - the mass of Indian soldiers - participated in the truce too. The key piece of evidence has turned out to be spice tins handed out to Indians on the front, as part of Princess Mary's Christmas Gift initiative, found later in the possession of German soldiers. Some of this tale was retold in an exhibition held at the Great War Huts Museum in Suffolk, England, where one such tin was also placed on display. We know these tins were from Indian soldiers fighting in the British army because of their contents. Most British troops received a Christmas box that contained cigarettes, a pipe, other smoking supplies and a signed card (below). The boxes made up for Indians avoided these items, since smoking is taboo among several communities. Instead, they held candy, cigarettes (except for the Sikh troops), a signed card, and, rather ironically, spices. (In a greater irony, while the soldiers did receive the boxes, it is worth mentioning that they received little else. There was little recognition of their service during the war, or in the decades that followed. Indians were also steadily discriminated against, a trend that continued through World War 2.) Back to the Christmas tale, ""to have Indian troops also take part in the truce has huge implications. We have evidence of these men from different continents, German and Indian, in no man's land, sharing experiences, and sharing whatever they had,"" says Peter Doyle, a military historian with Goldsmiths, University of London, who curated the exhibition in Suffolk. The story of how the boxes came about has become a bit of history in itself. A total of 2.5 million were dispatched. It took immense fundraising and organisation to make the gift a reality, particularly in the midst of the war, Doyle says. He traces some of that effort in his 2021 book, For Every Sailor Afloat, Every Soldier at the Front. The effort began with a letter from the then-17-year-old princess published across Britain's major newspapers, announcing her intention to send a Christmas present ""from the whole nation to every sailor afloat and every soldier at the front"". As donations poured in, a high-ranking committee was set up, to decide on the nature of the gift, and, with trademark British efficiency, dispatch enough that no soldier was left wanting. There was reportedly plenty of deliberation on what to give the Indian men. At one point, records show that the Parsi industrialist and philanthropist Ratanji Tata (1871-1918; son of Tata Industries founder Jamsetji Tata) was consulted. Determined to learn more about this story within the story, Doyle began digging into the history of the Indian soldiers' Christmas exchange. He knew, for instance, that the 39th Garhwal Rifles was stationed in Givenchy, France, in December 1914, and wondered whether there was any further evidence lurking there. He approached a friend, the German historian Robin Schafer, who dug into archives in Germany and found references in newspapers of the time that confirmed what Doyle had suspected. ""The Garhwal Rifles met in no man's land with members of Germany's 16th Westphalian regiment and exchanged gifts,"" he says. ""It was recorded in German newspapers at the time that one of the things exchanged was a shiny tin full of Indian spices."" It is strange to think of the Garhwals, feared for their skill in battle, stepping across to extend a hand in peace, on a festival not even their own. Doyle says he hopes this discovery will serve as a further reminder of the ""intense engagement"" of Indian troops on the Western Front. Records indicate that over 74,000 Indians died in battle during World War 1. In all, undivided India sent over 1 million troops to fight in the war.

Skin tint: - l'oreal tinted serum (a lot of people recommend true match, but I only tried infallible tinted serum and I believe it'd be better for oily skin) and I love the coverage this one gives - NYX glaze skin tint is good too I believe it would be great for dry skin cos it's kind of oily but nothing too crazy - Milani skin tint stick is worth the hype (I saw reviews of it getting oily but that should be fine for dry skin) it's also great coverage for a skin tint Concealer: - I tried Milani briefly at the store but I liked the formula. I think it'd be nice for dry skin. - NYX concealer serum is good too (I'm super picky about concealer but these ones are the best I've tried from the drugstore even though they haven't completely sold me on concealers. . I still am not fully into them) Contouring and bronzing: - NYX buttermelt bronzers (powder) the shade isn't orange so it'd be good for contouring - Milani cream bronzer, it is loved by people for a good reason Setting spray: Milani Setting powder: elf if you don't mind the random sparkly particles and Milani banana powder (Nikki La Rose really loved it and she loves high end powders like Givenchy) Blush: NYX buttermelt blushes are gorgeous (powder) and Milani for cream blushes. You really can't go wrong with these two. Absolute gorgeousness. Highlighter: Milani baked highlighter. . so worth the hype for me. It's exactly the highlighter look I love and want.

1lcm56n,2025-06-16 06:54:36,en,REDDIT,"  On December 24, 1914, amid the bloodshed and chaos of the Great War, peace unexpectedly broke out along the Western Front. Spontaneously and without official sanction, troops on both sides observed a series of ceasefires, setting aside their weapons and exchanging gifts and souvenirs in no man's land. Joint burials and unsanctioned prisoner swaps were carried out. There was carolling, and even some impromptu football. The spontaneous reaching out was named the Christmas Truce and celebrated in newspaper reports of the time as a sign of our enduring humanity. It would not be repeated, as the war tore on, but it would become one of the most storied events of World War 1. Now, new evidence is uncovering how that great force within the Allied forces — the mass of Indian soldiers — participated in the truce too. The key piece of evidence has turned out to be spice tins handed out to Indians on the front, as part of Princess Mary's Christmas Gift initiative, found later in the possession of German soldiers. Some of this tale was retold in an exhibition held at the Great War Huts Museum in Suffolk, England, where one such tin was also placed on display. We know these tins were from Indian soldiers fighting in the British army because of their contents. Most British troops received a Christmas box that contained cigarettes, a pipe, other smoking supplies and a signed card. The boxes made up for Indians avoided most of these items, since smoking is taboo among several communities. Instead, these boxes held candy, cigarettes (except for the Sikh troops), a signed card, and, rather ironically, spices. (In a greater irony, while the soldiers did receive the boxes, it is worth mentioning that they received little else. There was little recognition of their service during the war, or in the decades that followed. Indians were also steadily discriminated against while they served, in a trend that would continue through World War 2.) Back to the Christmas Truce, “it is fascinating because it reflects a sense of humanity in the depth of this really horrific time,” says Peter Doyle, a military historian with Goldsmiths, University of London, who curated the exhibition in Suffolk. “To have Indian troops also take part in the truce has huge implications. We have evidence of these men from different continents, German and Indian, in no man's land, sharing experiences, and sharing whatever they had.” **The Tata connection** The story of how the boxes came about has become a bit of history in itself. A total of 2.5 million were dispatched (incidentally, about 5 million British soldiers went into battle, across the four years). It took immense fundraising and organisation to make the gift a reality, particularly in the midst of the war, Doyle says. He traces some of that effort in his 2021 book, For Every Sailor Afloat, Every Soldier at the Front. The effort began with a letter from the then-17-year-old princess published across Britain's major newspapers, announcing her intention to send a Christmas present “from the whole nation to every sailor afloat and every soldier at the front”. As donations poured in, a high-ranking committee was set up, to decide on the nature of the gift, and, with trademark British efficiency, dispatch enough that no soldier was left wanting. There was reportedly plenty of deliberation on what to give the Indian men. At one point, records show that the Parsi industrialist and philanthropist Ratanji Tata (1871-1918; son of Tata Industries founder Jamsetji Tata) was consulted. **A quiet retelling** Determined to learn more about this story within the story, Doyle began digging into the history of the Indian soldiers' Christmas exchange. He knew, for instance, that the 39th Garhwal Rifles was stationed in Givenchy, France, in December 1914, and wondered whether there was any further evidence lurking there. He approached a friend, the German historian Robin Schafer, who dug into archives in Germany and found references in newspapers of the time that confirmed what Doyle had suspected. “The Garhwal Rifles met in no man's land with members of Germany's 16th Westphalian regiment and exchanged gifts,” he says. “It was recorded in German newspapers at the time that one of the things exchanged was a shiny tin full of Indian spices.” It is strange to think of the young Garhwals, feared for their skill in battle, stepping across to extend a hand in peace, on a festival not even their own. “There was a general sense of respect and fear that went with meeting Indian soldiers,” says Doyle. “So the opportunity to do that in no man's land and see what they were like, see the warmth of engagement during that truce, must have been something spectacular.” Doyle says he hopes this discovery will add to the growing discourse and serve as a further reminder of the “intense engagement” of Indian troops on the Western Front. Records indicate that over 74,000 Indians died in battle during World War 1. In all, undivided India sent over 1 million troops to fight in the war."

The son of billionaire George Soros got married to the former aide to Hillary Clinton on June 14, 2025. While they originally intended to elope, the bride and groom ended up tying the knot in the Hamptons, per Vogue. Abedin's union with Soros marks her second marriage. The Both/And author was previously married to former Democratic congressman Anthony Weiner, with whom she shares son Jordan. Abedin announced her separation from Weiner in August 2016 and filed for divorce in May 2017 after Weiner pled guilty to sexting with a minor that same month. The former political aide met Soros in 2023 and got engaged less than a year later in 2024. “It's a little bit of a surreal experience to be in a relationship with Alex,” Abedin told New York Magazine in 2025. “I had never imagined I would meet someone whose life so seamlessly blended with mine.” Here is everything to know about Alexander Soros and Huma Abedin's relationship. They met at a party thrown by Nicky Hilton Noam Galai/Getty Alex Soros and Huma Abedin attend The Gordon Parks Foundation Awards Dinner and Auction on May 20, 2025 in New York City. Abedin met her future husband in the fall of 2023 at a party thrown by their mutual friends, Nicky Hilton and her husband James Rothschild, per Vogue.

mov_66C43DED33F009484008788D42EA4B28,2025-06-18 12:03:49,en,WEB,"  The ancient city of Ijebu-Ode was transformed into a living runway on June 8, 2025, as thousands gathered for the annual Ojude Oba festival – a stunning fusion of fashion, heritage, pageantry, and cultural pride. With its riot of colour, movement, and symbolism, this year's celebration affirmed its place as one of Nigeria's most spectacular and fashionable traditional events. Often likened to a cultural Met Gala, the 2025 edition of Ojude Oba did not disappoint, delivering high-octane glamour and deeply rooted tradition in equal measure. From the breathtaking procession of Regberegbe groups to the majestic parade of horse-riding warriors, the festival was a feast for the senses — and a powerful testament to the enduring spirit of the Ijebu people. A Cultural Catwalk Like No Other At the heart of the festival was the elaborate display by the Regberegbe — age-grade groups made up of families, friends, and community members. Each group appeared in carefully coordinated traditional outfits, planned months in advance. The fashion on show was nothing short of regal: opulent aso-oke, shimmering lace, richly embroidered velvet, sequinned adire, and luxurious damask flowed in waves across the festival grounds. It was a catwalk under the sun. Women dazzled in towering gele headwraps, layered coral beads, and matching clutches and fans. Men cut striking figures in elaborately stitched agbadas, monogrammed fila caps, and polished walking sticks that served as both accessory and status symbol. From pastel palettes to royal blues and crimson reds, the aesthetic coordination within each group was jaw-dropping. The looks were not just about beauty; they told stories of identity, unity, and pride. Some groups wore outfits themed around heritage motifs or family crests, while others showcased modern reinterpretations of ancient patterns. The creativity was endless, and each entrance was met with loud applause from the thousands who lined the Awujale's forecourt. When Fashion Meets Swagger: The Horsemen Return No Ojude Oba is complete without the dramatic entry of the Balogun and Eleshin families — descendants of Ijebu warriors who now honour their legacy on horseback. These processions were among the most anticipated moments of the day. Adorned in chainmail-style tunics, richly beaded garments, and grand turbans, the horsemen rode decorated steeds through the streets, firing ceremonial gunshots and saluting the Awujale, the revered monarch of Ijebu land, Oba (Dr) Sikiru Kayode Adetona. One standout figure, Farooq Oreagba, a cancer survivor turned fashion icon, drew massive attention with his custom embroidered agbada, signature dark shades, and coral bead accessories. His entrance went viral again this year, reinforcing his status as the “King of Steeze” and a cultural ambassador for contemporary Nigerian style. A-Listers, Music, and Pop Culture Fusion The 2025 festival also saw a growing presence of celebrities and influencers who brought star power to the traditional event. Nollywood stars like Lateef Adedimeji, Femi Branch, and Bimbo Thomas mingled with the crowd, while singer Lil Kesh thrilled fans as he arrived in a youthful take on aso-oke. Actress Eniola Badmus turned heads with her blend of tradition and trend: a Givenchy shirt, flowing lace wrapper, trainers, and an umbrella to match — earning her praise for her avant-garde fusion of street and cultural fashion. On social media, posts featuring these looks dominated feeds with hashtags like #OjudeOba2025 and #FashionMeetsTradition. More Than a Show: Rituals, Prayers, and Royal Salutes Yet beyond the glamour and selfies, Ojude Oba remained a deeply spiritual and ceremonial affair. The highlight was the homage paid to the Awujale, Oba Adetona, by each Regberegbe. They danced, sang, and presented symbolic gifts in a colourful procession, offering prayers for his continued health and the prosperity of Ijebu land. As drums rolled and talking drums echoed ancestral chants, the monarch, seated under a royal canopy, received his subjects with grace and authority. The festival also featured Quranic recitations, traditional chants, and blessings by Islamic scholars and royal chiefs. Culture as Economy and Identity The economic impact of the festival was visible at every turn. Tailors, weavers, makeup artists, jewellery vendors, and event planners benefited massively from the months-long preparation that preceded the ceremony. Fashion houses from Lagos to Abeokuta reported increased commissions, while hotels and transport operators in Ijebu-Ode worked at full capacity. Governor Dapo Abiodun, who was present and resplendent in his own gold-embroidered agbada, praised the cultural and economic significance of Ojude Oba. He said the festival not only reinforces the values of unity and identity but also boosts tourism and crafts-based industries. An Evolving Tradition With Global Appeal Originating in the 19th century as a gathering of Ijebu Muslim converts to thank their king after Eid, Ojude Oba has evolved into a pan-religious, pan-Yoruba celebration. Christians, Muslims, traditionalists, and even non-Ijebus now participate freely, highlighting the inclusive and progressive spirit of the people. With its global livestream, growing fashion influence, and media buzz, Ojude Oba is fast becoming a cultural export. It proves that tradition need not be static — it can evolve, excite, and empower. Final Word: Fashion is the Message Ojude Oba 2025 proved once again that fashion is not just about fabric; it's about legacy, story, and self-expression. The event was a stunning example of how cultural pride can be elevated through creativity, confidence, and coordination. In a country often divided, the sight of thousands moving in rhythm, clad in matching outfits, chanting in unity, was a powerful symbol of what Nigeria can be. As the dust settled and the drums faded, one truth remained: in Ijebu-Ode, culture is not just remembered — it is worn, paraded, and proudly lived."

Wystawny ślub Alexa Sorosa z Humą Abedin. On jest synem słynnego miliardera, ona byłą doradczynią Hillary Clinton Wielki ślub na amerykańskich salonach! Alex Soros (40 l.), przewodniczący Open Society Foundations i syn miliardera George'a Sorosa, poślubił Humę Abedin (50 l.), dawną doradczynię Hillary Clinton. Huma Abedin, niegdyś najbliższa współpracowniczka Hillary Clinton, od lat kojarzona była z dramatycznym rozpadem małżeństwa z byłym kongresmanem Anthonym Weinerem, przyłapanym na pisaniu niedwuznacznych wiadomości z poznanymi w sieci kobietami. Teraz jednak, w wieku niespełna 50 lat, zawarła związek małżeński z Alexandrem Sorosem, 39-letnim przewodniczącym Open Society Foundations i synem miliardera George'a Sorosa. Miłość zaczęła się od imprezy u Rothschildów i Hiltonów ""The New York Times"" opublikował historię tego związku. Jak pisze, para znała się z widzenia od lat, ale dopiero przypadkowe spotkanie na przyjęciu urodzinowym Nicky Hilton Rothschild w październiku 2023 roku sprawiło, że między tymi dwojgiem zaiskrzyło. Podobno znaleźli wspólny język w cichym kącie restauracji, wśród muzyki serwowanej przez celebrytkę i dziedziczkę Paris Hilton. Potem wspólna inicjatywa w ramach Vital Voices zamieniła się w długą wymianę SMS-ów, później rozmów telefonicznych, a w końcu spotkanie na forum w Dosze w grudniu 2023 roku. Alex zaskoczył Humę prezentem – wiedząc, że jej zmarły ojciec kochał Wiedeń i tort Sachera, przywiózł jej właśnie taki deser z Austrii. Abedin miała na sobie suknie od Givenchy i Erdem, a Soros smoking Diora W czerwcu 2024 Alex oświadczył się, chowając pierścionek z diamentem w pojemniku na jedzenie na wynos. Ślub odbył się rok później – najpierw 13 czerwca w Southampton, gdzie podpisali zarówno ketubę (żydowski kontrakt ślubny), jak i nikah (muzułmańską wersję kontraktu), a dzień później odbyła się ceremonia w ekskluzywnym Water Mill. Abedin miała na sobie suknie od Givenchy i Erdem, on – dobrze dopasowany smoking Diora.

O casal, conhecido por talento e carisma, chamou atenção com looks luxuosos avaliados em mais de R$ 80 mil, combinando sofisticação e tendências. Bruna, com um visual de R$ 30 mil, destacou-se pela elegância, enquanto Neymar apostou em um conjunto Louis Vuitton de R$ 50 mil. A saída familiar, que reuniu outros famosos, reforça a influência do casal no mundo da moda e entretenimento. O evento, que atraiu famílias e celebridades, foi marcado por produções impecáveis e momentos de descontração. A presença de Mavie, com um look estiloso, consolidou o trio como referência em estilo. Além disso, a escolha de marcas de alto padrão reflete o status de Bruna e Neymar como ícones fashion. Bruna Biancardi com vestido e jaqueta Loewe, além de botas Givenchy. Neymar com moletom Louis Vuitton em veludo tie-dye. Mavie com jaqueta de couro e laço vermelho, esbanjando charme. A noite foi um verdadeiro desfile de moda, com o casal aproveitando o evento ao lado de outros nomes conhecidos, como Pedro Scooby e Cintia Dicker. Grávida de Mel, Bruna Biancardi escolheu um vestido branco canelado da Loewe, com comprimento mini e uma discreta fenda lateral, que valorizou sua silhueta de forma natural. O modelo, que combina feminilidade e praticidade, é ideal para eventos casuais com um toque de sofisticação. Para se proteger do frio paulistano, a influenciadora completou o visual com uma jaqueta jeans oversized, também da Loewe, avaliada em R$ 8,5 mil. A peça trouxe um ar despojado, remetendo às tendências dos anos 90, mas sem perder a aura de luxo. O ponto alto do look, no entanto, foram as botas Shark Lock da Givenchy, um ícone do street style de alto padrão. Avaliadas em R$ 23 mil na Farfetch, elas possuem um design marcante, com detalhes em couro e um fecho metálico que adiciona modernidade. A escolha reflete o cuidado de Bruna em alinhar tendências globais ao seu estilo pessoal, mesmo durante a gravidez. A maquiagem leve, com tons neutros, e os cabelos soltos em ondas suaves complementaram a produção, destacando a barriga de grávida como um elemento de charme. O look, avaliado em mais de R$ 30 mil, é um exemplo de como Bruna equilibra moda, conforto e personalidade. Neymar, por sua vez, não deixou a desejar no quesito estilo. O jogador optou por um conjunto de moletom em veludo da Louis Vuitton, avaliado em R$ 50 mil, que mistura tons escuros com bege e marrom em um efeito tie-dye moderno. A jaqueta oversized, com texturas variadas, trouxe um toque vanguardista, enquanto o boné branco, usado ao contrário, reforçou sua assinatura descolada. Nos pés, tênis robustos com solado tratorado completaram o visual, mantendo a essência streetwear que o craque adota em eventos casuais. A escolha de peças de alto padrão reforça a posição de Neymar como um dos atletas mais influentes no mundo da moda, capaz de transitar entre o esporte e o lifestyle de luxo. A pequena Mavie, de apenas 1 ano e 8 meses, roubou corações com um look que reflete o DNA fashionista da família. A filha de Bruna e Neymar usou uma jaqueta de couro preta em miniatura, combinada com calça jeans e tênis brancos, garantindo conforto e estilo. Um laço vermelho no cabelo trouxe um toque de doçura, equilibrando a produção com charme infantil. A escolha do look de Mavie mostra como Bruna e Neymar investem em produções coordenadas para a família, criando uma imagem coesa e impactante. A pequena, com sua atitude tranquila, já desponta como uma verdadeira it baby, acompanhando os pais em eventos de grande visibilidade. Além da família Neymar-Biancardi, o “Disney On Ice” reuniu diversas celebridades no Ginásio Ibirapuera. O surfista Pedro Scooby e a modelo Cintia Dicker marcaram presença com a filha Aurora, que também esbanjou estilo em um look infantil moderno. O lutador José Aldo, o ator Babu Santana e a influenciadora Dandynha Barbosa foram outros nomes que aproveitaram o espetáculo, reforçando a relevância do evento no calendário de São Paulo. A presença de tantas figuras públicas destaca o apelo familiar do “Disney On Ice”, que combina entretenimento infantil com momentos de convivência entre pais e filhos. O evento, que percorre diversas cidades, é conhecido por atrair um público diverso, incluindo personalidades do esporte, da TV e das redes sociais. A aparição de Bruna e Neymar reforça a crescente influência das marcas de luxo no Brasil, especialmente entre celebridades. Loewe, Givenchy e Louis Vuitton, presentes nos looks do casal, são nomes que dominam o mercado global, com peças que chegam a custar o equivalente a um carro popular. Loewe: conhecida por designs minimalistas e sofisticados. Givenchy: aposta em acessórios statement, como as botas Shark Lock. Louis Vuitton: líder em streetwear de alto padrão. Essa tendência reflete o poder de compra de celebridades brasileiras e a busca por peças que combinem exclusividade e visibilidade nas redes sociais. Grávida de sua segunda filha, Bruna tem usado a moda como uma forma de expressão durante a gestação. Seus looks, que unem conforto e sofisticação, servem de inspiração para mulheres que buscam manter o estilo sem abrir mão da praticidade. O vestido Loewe, por exemplo, é versátil e pode ser adaptado para diferentes ocasiões, enquanto a jaqueta oversized adiciona um toque moderno sem esforço. A influenciadora, que acumula milhões de seguidores nas redes sociais, compartilha frequentemente suas escolhas de moda, influenciando tendências e reforçando sua posição como referência no universo fashion...."

7dd727fd8f4bd29b663f732f00d9cf12,2025-06-23 08:51:00,en,WEB,"  The cost of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's upcoming nuptials has been 'revealed' and, as you'd probably expect, the pair are seemingly going all out. Bezos and Sanchez got engaged in May 2023 and are finally set to tie the knot this week, according to reports. The duo are said to be marrying in Venice, Italy, on Saturday (June 27). Many A-listers are expected to attend their wedding; from Katy Perry and Oprah Winfrey, to Mick Jagger and Ivanka Trump. Advert Last year it was reported that the pair were spending a staggering $600 million on their nuptials, but the Amazon founder later refuted these claims. But new reports have suggested that Bezos and Sanchez could be forking out anywhere between $15 million to $20 million, per Mail Online. Speaking on this large sum, Kunal Madan, the CEO and Founder of DressPreservation.com, and Zoe Buke, from Hitched.co.uk, said it's likely that the famous pair will pay as much as much as $5 million for a private set from a high-profile performer like Beyoncé or Andrea Bocelli. Advert Then there's transport. Sanchez and Bezos are rumored to have invited 200 guests to their wedding, all of whom will need help getting to their wedding. Madan shared: ""Private jet travel for clients, superyacht transfers, or helicopter landings, transport arrangements for A-listers can vary from $500,000 to $2 million, depending on security and logistics."" Buke added that the couple's high profile guests will probably be put up in luxury 5-star accommodation. Then, of course, there's Sanchez's dress, the cost of which 'can easily surpass $1 million', say the experts. Advert ""Couture wedding dresses alone run $500,000 to $1 million, not to speak of a one-off haute couture wedding dress by Dior, Valentino, or Elie Saab, and with several wardrobe changes,"" said Madan. ""Accessories, custom suits for Bezos, and styling personnel drive it up."" Buke also pointed out that the couple's fits are likely to be bespoke. According to The Telegraph, Dolce & Gabbana is the favorite fashion house for Sanchez's dress, while Oscar de la Renta, Vera Wang, and Givenchy may also be in the running. Other things noted in the round-up of costs include floristry and decor, photography, catering, wedding favors, and a wedding planner. Advert Reportedly, they are sourcing some 80 percent of their wedding provisions from Venetian vendors as a way to share their appreciation for the city, says PA. While the celebrity couple and their guests will be excited about the pending wedding, not everyone is pleased. The lavish affair has attracted the attention of protesters, who on Thursday (June 19) hung a banner on St Mark's bell tower with Bezos's name crossed out. Advert They cite the risk of disruptions in a city so overrun with mass tourism that officials are for a second year requiring day-trippers to pay a tax to enter on key summer days. Alice Bazzoli, an activist with No Space for Bezos, said to Sky News: ""[Bezos] is basically going to treat the whole city as a private ballroom, as a private event area, as if the citizens are not there."" Federica Toninelli, another activist associated with No Space for Bezos, added: ""This is not what Venice needs. This is not what a city that is already suffering from overtourism needs."" UNILAD have contacted Jeff Bezos for comment."

Madan shared: ""Private jet travel for clients, superyacht transfers, or helicopter landings, transport arrangements for A-listers can vary from $500,000 to $2 million, depending on security and logistics."" Buke added that the couple's high profile guests will probably be put up in luxury 5-star accommodation. Then, of course, there's Sanchez's dress, the cost of which 'can easily surpass $1 million', say the experts. Reportedly the couple are set to say their 'I dos' on June 27 (Marc Piasecki/WireImage) ""Couture wedding dresses alone run $500,000 to $1 million, not to speak of a one-off haute couture wedding dress by Dior, Valentino, or Elie Saab, and with several wardrobe changes,"" said Madan. ""Accessories, custom suits for Bezos, and styling personnel drive it up."" Buke also pointed out that the couple's fits are likely to be bespoke. According to The Telegraph, Dolce & Gabbana is the favorite fashion house for Sanchez's dress, while Oscar de la Renta, Vera Wang, and Givenchy may also be in the running. Other things noted in the round-up of costs include floristry and decor, photography, catering, wedding favors, and a wedding planner. Reportedly, they are sourcing some 80 percent of their wedding provisions from Venetian vendors as a way to share their appreciation for the city, says PA. Bezos' Venetian wedding has sparked protests in the city (ANDREA PATTARO/AFP via ) While the celebrity couple and their guests will be excited about the pending wedding, not everyone is pleased. The lavish affair has attracted the attention of protesters, who on Thursday (June 19) hung a banner on St Mark's bell tower with Bezos's name crossed out. They cite the risk of disruptions in a city so overrun with mass tourism that officials are for a second year requiring day-trippers to pay a tax to enter on key summer days. Alice Bazzoli, an activist with No Space for Bezos, said to Sky News: ""[Bezos] is basically going to treat the whole city as a private ballroom, as a private event area, as if the citizens are not there."" Federica Toninelli, another activist associated with No Space for Bezos, added: ""This is not what Venice needs. This is not what a city that is already suffering from overtourism needs."" UNILAD have contacted Jeff Bezos for comment."

The couple attended the premiere for Johansson's latest movie, Jurassic World Rebirth, at the Hearst Plaza at Lincoln Center in New York on June 23 and wore coordinating ensembles for the event. Johansson and Jost both wore all white to the event. The actress looked stunning in a Givenchy gown that featured lingerie and bridal-inspired elements. The bust of the gown featured a lace-covered corset that gave her a hint of cleavage and cinched in her waist, while the rest of the fitted gown contained more of the romantic lace details, as well as delicate ruffles that extended to the hem.

mov_4AC433DB3311D27AC840199C840FC561,2025-06-25 01:48:03,en,WEB,"  Everybody knows the Big Yeti with magnetic hands, snatching passes season after season, etching his name in history with seven-straight 1,000-plus yard streaks. But this offseason, the gridiron giant is nowhere near the end zone. Instead, he's spotted strolling hand in hand with a pop star, flashing smiles at charity galas, swaying to the music at wedding parties, and mentoring students at TNU. His 2025 calendar bursts with appearances, yet his most intriguing moves happen off the spotlight. Behind the scenes, his business empire quietly expands, a web of ventures stretching far beyond football. Now, a new, colorful side emerges, hidden in plain sight. So, one definite thing is: Travis Kelce's resume isn't just dominating defenses anymore! Back in 2023, tight end Travis Kelce made a bold off-field move. He teamed up with his brother Jason Kelce and MLB slugger Aaron Judge for a special move. The trio invested in the energy drink brand Accelerator. Since then, Travis has been front and center in almost every Accelerator commercial. Those gave him the chance to try some acting. Once he took on the role of a newscaster for Accelerator energy drinks. In that spot, Kelce played a character named “Travis Cornflower,” who gave off a strong Ron Burgundy vibe. In fact, he also keeps the drink close during recordings of his podcast, New Heights. But this time, it came up with a challenge. The brand recently posted a dare on Instagram. The caption read, “This would be crazy right??? Or would it .” It pushed fans to take on something wild. The image showed a traditional-style tattoo of Jason Kelce, with one hand behind his head. Shirtless, flexing, and full of attitude, inked on someone's leg. But this time, it was the turn of the younger brother. Hence, text on the image said, “If somebody Pinup Travis with Accelarator tattooed we'd have to send them an insane amount of cases.” Now, most would have scrolled past, assuming it was a joke, but not Travis' fans. Expand Post Surprisingly, a fan took the challenge seriously. And guess what? The Kelce brothers liked it so much that they posted about it on Instagram. Their caption said, “Somebody took accelerator up on their offer!” The next slide showed the bold traditional style tattoo of Travis, hiding his bare body with the energy drink, and portraying the accelerator as a rocket. It was etched on a fan's thigh. The design also showed Travis wearing the Chiefs' signature red boots and gloves, absolutely in the energy of a diva. Apart from that, he had no other gear on. Surprisingly, the post hit 2,000 likes in just two hours, and fans quickly poured their reactions in the comment section, with many saying, “I need to see Taylor's reaction!” Hilarious, even we want to see that too! After all, through all the ups and downs, one person has remained steady for Travis, besides his family. It is none other than pop icon Taylor Swift, who recently turned heads at a college event with Kelce. Taylor Swift is stealing the spotlight at Tight-End University Tight End University kicked off its opening night on Monday, June 24, 2025, in Nashville, Tennessee. The event was founded in 2021 by Travis Kelce, George Kittle, and Greg Olsen. TEU gathers NFL tight ends each offseason for drills, training, and bonding. This year, 78 tight ends joined in. The event is also known for giving back, raising money for causes beyond the field. No doubt, TEU blends hard work, elite competition, and team spirit. But this year the football was bejewelled. Taylor Swift made a surprise appearance at the TEU welcome night. Her presence shifted the energy. Cameras flashed as fans reacted. Her arrival beside Travis Kelce became one of the most talked-about moments of the evening...."

mov_49BCC75489BE3F94B02BCA2CE9D5B264,2025-06-25 17:03:06,en,WEB,"  In a dazzling blend of sports and entertainment, Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce made headlines this week with their highly anticipated red carpet debut at the opening night of Tight End University in Nashville, Tennessee. The event, held on Monday, June 24, 2025, marked a significant moment for the couple, who have been romantically linked since 2023 but had never before appeared together on such a public stage. Founded in 2021 by Kelce alongside fellow NFL tight ends George Kittle and Greg Olsen, Tight End University is an annual three-day summer camp designed to bring tight ends across the league together for training, networking, and camaraderie. The event offers a mix of on-field drills, film study, recovery, and rehabilitation activities, fostering a sense of community among players. This year's gathering, hosted at Vanderbilt University, drew attention not only for its athletic focus but also for the star power brought by Swift's presence. Swift and Kelce's arrival was nothing short of a fashion statement. Kelce sported a sophisticated Givenchy ensemble, featuring ivory shorts, pristine white sneakers, and a white knit t-shirt accented with yellow sleeve stripes. Swift complemented him perfectly in a Hunter Bell green and white gingham crop top paired with a matching peplum skirt, accessorized with a Logan Hollowell hand chain and a Celine Camille 16 bag. Their coordinated outfits caught the eyes of photographers and fans alike, as they walked hand-in-hand, beaming with joy and sealing the moment with a kiss captured on camera. Social media erupted with images and videos of the couple's red carpet debut. The official Tight End University Instagram page shared a slow-motion clip of them walking to the tune of Swift's own hit song ""Ready For It,"" further fueling excitement among fans. Attendees also captured Swift hugging and dancing with fans, showcasing her down-to-earth charm amidst the glitz. Beyond the glamour, Swift's involvement in the event extended into the evening's afterparty at Nashville's Brooklyn Bowl, where she delivered a surprise acoustic performance of her 2014 hit ""Shake It Off."" Borrowing Chase Rice's guitar, Swift energized the crowd with an unplanned set, revealing, ""We just figured out that we are gonna play that three minutes ago."" She encouraged the audience to sing along and dedicated the performance to her ""favorite players,"" the tight ends present at the event. This marked Swift's first time back on stage since regaining control of her recorded music catalog, a milestone she announced in a heartfelt letter in late May 2025. The singer described reclaiming her masters as her ""greatest dream come true,"" a victory celebrated by Kelce on his ""New Heights"" podcast, where he joyfully proclaimed, ""Just bought all her music back. It's finally hers."" The couple's chemistry was on full display throughout the event. An amusing moment captured on social media showed Swift playfully photobombing a picture of Kelce with Los Angeles Raiders' tight end Ian Thomas, a lighthearted snapshot that delighted fans. Their presence together at Tight End University not only highlighted their personal relationship but also underscored Swift's support for Kelce's professional endeavors. Sources close to the couple shared insights into their evolving dynamic. According to People magazine, Swift is ""really excited for this season—not just to support Travis, but because it's the first full football season where she's not on tour."" The conclusion of her Eras Tour has freed up her schedule, allowing her to attend as many of Kelce's games as possible. ""Her schedule is much more open now,"" a source noted, ""and she's genuinely excited to have the time and flexibility to show up for Travis more consistently."" This newfound rhythm offers the couple a chance to settle into a routine after nearly two years of managing demanding schedules across continents. Kelce, a three-time Super Bowl champion, wrapped up last NFL season with three touchdowns and 823 receiving yards, and is gearing up for the new season starting September 5, 2025, against the Los Angeles Chargers. Swift's enthusiastic support is expected to bolster his morale as he embarks on another competitive year. Their relationship has been marked by mutual admiration and public displays of affection, with Kelce previously making a surprise appearance on Swift's Eras Tour and Swift attending several of his games. The couple also shared a quiet family supper in May 2025 to celebrate Mother's Day, signaling their growing closeness beyond the public eye. Swift's influence extends beyond the stadium and concert stage. Her successful battle to regain ownership of her music masters has inspired other artists, including the hard rock band Five Finger Death Punch, who are now re-recording their albums in a similar fight for control. Zoltan Bathory of the band praised Swift's proactive approach, stating, ""Instead, she just sprung into action and did what she had to do."" This business acumen adds another layer to Swift's multifaceted public persona. As the NFL season approaches, the spotlight on Kelce intensifies, but with Swift by his side, the couple embodies a powerful blend of sportsmanship and star power. Their joint appearance at Tight End University not only celebrated football but also highlighted the merging of two worlds—music and sports—in a way that captivates fans from both arenas. With the Eras Tour behind her and a new chapter unfolding, Taylor Swift is poised to be the ultimate cheerleader for Travis Kelce's 2025 NFL season. Their journey together continues to enchant fans, blending romance, support, and shared ambition, all set against the vibrant backdrop of Nashville's summer sports scene."

The 49-year-old actress - who has adopted kids Jackson, 12, and nine-year-old August - think she is ""too old"" for certain popular terms, while she is ""not allowed"" to use other phrases because they have gone out of fashion. Walking the red carpet in a fishnet Givenchy outfit at the Los Angeles premiere of her latest movie The Old Guard 2, Charlize told Extra of her look: ""August gave it a thumbs-up."" Host Terri Seymour then asked: ""What do they say? Would it be 'snatched'? Do we say you're looking 'snatched'?"" Charlize admitted: ""Apparently, I'm not allowed to say it. There's so many things I'm just not allowed to say anymore. I'm still learning my way. ""'Rizz' is something that I can't say. Nobody says it, apparently. There's a lot of like, 'You can't say that because you're old,' but she was like 'Nobody even says that anymore,' so every day is an education. All of it. ""Things change so fast… I wouldn't go by my understanding of this very intricate language of the Gen Alphas and Zs."" And while Charlize ""loved"" her retro hairstyle in The Old Guard 2, she recently admitted her kids were horrified by her mullet. Speaking on Late Night with Seth Meyers, she said: ""I have two girls, and they're very, very... they're mostly very girly. And they think of me as a princess. And they want Mom to look like a princess. ""But they came back from school. I was in my bathroom and I was getting it cut and it had already been coloured. And I just remember looking over and they both came into the room really excited, and then they just both froze. And they just went... and one started crying. ""One literally started bawling their eyes out. And I had to actually sit down with her and say, 'We all get to be who we want to be. And right now, Mom wants to wear a mullet.' I don't tell you what to do with your hair."" Impersonating one of her children, Charlize added: ""I still don't like it."" The Mad Max: Fury Road actress revealed last month that her children are unimpressed by her Hollywood career. During an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live! , Theron quipped: ""My children have zero respect for me. ""It's just unbelievable, I feel like I'm pretty humble, but every once in a while I'm like, 'There's a f****** Oscar right there.' They are so not impressed with me."" Charlize recalled an incident when her youngest child unflatteringly compared her with Tom Cruise. She explained: ""I was picking up my youngest from dance yesterday and we drove past the new Mission Impossible poster where Tom Cruise is hanging onto some yellow plane, and he just looks really cool. ""My kids were with me when I shot Old Guard 2 and I worked on this incredibly intricate sequence where we brought in this amazing helicopter pilot, Fred North, and we were gonna choreograph me fighting helicopters and jumping on this real helicopter and hanging off. Shooting 99 per cent of it on a real helicopter as it's trying to shake me off like a rag doll. ""We took like two weeks to shoot this sequence and I was like, 'Wow, I just did that, that's really amazing.' And my child yesterday just looked at this poster of Tom Cruise and went, 'It's weird, he looks so much cooler than you did when you were hanging off the helicopter.' ""I was just like, 'I hung off the helicopter, [can I have] some credit?'"""

mov_9E687E6175ABA3C6D0F1A00A40778891,2025-06-28 13:30:00,en,WEB,"  Jenna Davis as M3gan and Ivanna Sakhno as Amelia in 'M3GAN 2.0.' Warning: Spoilers for M3gan 2.0 ahead! In M3gan 2.0, the killer robot returns once again — and as it turns out, she never really left. Instead, she's spent the last two years secretly living and growing inside of Gemma's (Allison Williams) computer and the Wi-Fi-connected smart devices in her home. During that time, M3gan's programming has evolved and matured, giving her a well-rounded sense of emotional depth and understanding. She's forced to reveal her existence after another rogue android named Amelia (Ivanna Sakhno) goes on a killing spree, and it seems like Gemma and her niece Cady (Violet McGraw) could be the next targets. Much like Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991), the sequel now sees M3gan's role switched from a destroyer to a protector. “If part of the jokey inspiration for the first M3GAN was that it was supposed to be our version of The Terminator, but with a killer doll instead of Arnold Schwarzenegger, then it felt right that the sequel would be Terminator 2: Judgment Day,” producer James Wan told Empire magazine. The enemy AI Amelia is searching for a motherboard AI from the 1980s that's been locked away for decades. She hopes to find it and connect it to the world's computers, causing the end of mankind and ushering in the robot uprising. Because Amelia's plan will hurt Cady, M3gan steps up and decides to fight back, convincing Gemma to build her a new, bigger, stronger body. So what happens at the end of M3gan 2.0? Here's everything to know about how the sci-fi thriller concludes, including a shocking twist that sets up the movie's explosive final scene. What's the big twist at the end of M3gan 2.0? © 2025 Universal Studios Ivanna Sakhno as Amelia in 'M3GAN 2.0.' The group follows Amelia into a secret lair in Silicon Valley where the '80s motherboard is locked away. But once they get there, they learn that Amelia isn't actually a sentient AI. Instead, she's been a puppet controlled by philanthropist Christian (Aristotle Athari). Christian is obsessed with ending AI and wants to ensure that humanity stops progressing with technology, fearing that one day the robots will overtake humans. To “prove” how dangerous AI can be, he purposefully built Amelia. He remotely controlled her, secretly orchestrating her killing spree, all in the hopes that it would scare humanity enough to support him in his crusade against machines. Once the group discovers the lair and Christian's intentions, he refuses to let them escape and aims to kill everyone except Gemma, whom he has a crush on. A big fight ensues, and M3gan tries to keep Gemma and Cady safe, but Christian calls in his employees to shock her with electric prodders. Afterward, it appears that M3gan is dead, and Christian implants a neural AI device in Gemma so he can control her just like Amelia, making her more “tolerable.” Little does he know that M3gan was able to upload herself into the device beforehand and is now living inside Gemma's implant. How does M3gan 2.0 end? © 2025 Universal Studios Ivanna Sakhno as Amelia in 'M3GAN 2.0.' Hoping to escape, Cady comes up with a plan to reprogram Amelia with the same commands that M3gan originally had: Protect Cady at all costs. This way, the android can be on their side and help them fight their way to freedom. But Christian calls in reinforcements, and soon, Amelia is overtaken. She is damaged so badly that she automatically goes into a hard reset, which revives her and removes all previous coding and commands, essentially giving her free will and making her sentient. Now, fully aware of how humans have puppeteered her, she sets out to destroy humankind and is determined to attach the '80s motherboard into the world's connected computers to get revenge against society. Still inside Gemma's implant, M3gan has an idea. When Gemma built M3gan's new body, she included a self-destruct mechanism to ensure that if M3gan went rogue again, she could stop her. M3gan realizes that if she can get back in her body and move close enough to Amelia, Gemma can detonate the device, killing them both. It's an important moment in the movie because it shows that M3gan has evolved to a point where she can understand consequences and comprehend the idea of sacrificing herself for those she loves. M3gan migrates her AI back into her body and walks to Amelia. Gemma then detonates the device. What happens to M3gan after the explosion in the finale? © 2025 Universal Studios Allison Williams as Gemma and Jen Van Epps as Tess in 'M3GAN 2.0.' At the end of the movie, audiences see Gemma and Cady back at home, with Gemma advocating for society to learn to live with AI instead of trying to control or limit it. She hopes that by treating AI like meaningful people, the machines will eventually understand that humans are not their overlords who need to be destroyed, but are friendly. Just as the film is about to end, the spell-correcting software on her computer starts to malfunction, eventually revealing itself to be M3gan, who made a copy of her AI before the explosion. M3gan's final line is, “So, did we save the world?” Will there be a third M3gan film? Universal Studios Jenna Davis as M3gan in 'M3GAN 2.0.'..."

c24ab10030bf380ac351de3b7f72fc02,2025-06-29 18:02:00,en,WEB,"  Friendship bracelets. Must-have merch. Idol worship. Global fame. Loyal fans who will give up a piece of their soul for you. Long before Taylor Swift released her first single, K-pop captivated audiences to create a new level of fandom heretofore unknown. And with that came the criticism. Netflix's animated “Kpop Demon Hunters” offers a window into the controversial culture of K-pop fandom via the supernatural. The movie has become a sensation, hitting No. 1 in more than 20 countries and for its original K-pop soundtrack ranking high on streaming charts. In the film, Korean folklore heroes and demons come to life as opposing K-pop groups: the noble girl group Huntr/x and the soul-sucking Saja Boys.The way that each approaches attracting and retaining fans hinges on the personal. Yes, a catchy song is important, but moreso are the personas and relationships built to make that lasting impression. “This is a battle for hearts and minds” The Saja Boys are loosely inspired by the Jeoseung saja, who in Korean folklore are psychopomps – with “Jeoseung” roughly translating to afterworld and “saja” meaning messenger or emissary – immortal beings ushering human souls to the afterlife, much like Charon the ferryman or the Grim Reaper. They're often depicted in traditional black hanbok and tall gat hats, which explains the Saja Boys' costuming later in the movie. “The look of those boys in the Third Act reveal is based on the Jeoseung saja, the Grim Reaper Korean mythology,” Chris Appelhans, who co-wrote and co-directed the movie with Maggie Kang, told Salon. “Because there's such a great tradition in K-pop of groups changing looks and always in ways that are fashionable and awesome-looking, we started there. We then got to match that up with a bunch of Givenchy costume designs . . . and basically bring a fantastic K-pop aesthetic with that historical theme.” In “Kpop Demon Hunters,” however, these demons are not waiting passively for humans to die but are rather preemptively harvesting souls through their addictive tunes and undeniable physical magnetism. They keep up a constant barrage of social media posts, variety show and surprise appearances. If charming seduction could dance, it would be the Saja Boys. One could interpret the Saja Boys as an indictment of the K-pop industry's capitalist drive. This is a business after all, and selling tickets, albums, sponsorships, interactive fan experiences and merch – both for the band overall and for a fan's “bias” or favorite band member – are the goal. Shelling out hundreds if not thousands of dollars a year is seen as an adequate trade-off for what the fan receives in return: an intense parasocial relationship. The idols' side of this contract is to actively present a reciprocal affection and appreciation through fan service. The band members find every opportunity to interact with their followers, from recording extra content to interacting with fans in person. In fact, it's the band that bestows the fandom name – ARMY for BTS, Stay for Stray Kids, etc. – upon their devotees. In the case of this movie, “saja” also means lion in Korean, hence the lion symbolizing the Saja Boys and dubbing their fandom Pride. “That was one of the most important things that we wanted to showcase in the movie – the fan and idol relationship because that relationship really is so special,” said Kang. “It doesn't really exist in any other sectors of entertainment, so idols are always providing a lot of content and giving to the fans, and then they receive love back from the fans. “I went to a Stray Kids concert, and it's just amazing how much fan service they do. They're crying on stage and you know that that's real, and the fans are crying, and it's just a huge cry fest and it's so beautiful. That itself is an energy, a kinetic energy that you can feel when you're in those concerts.” On the surface the Saja Boys appear to be appreciative of their fans, but a closer read of the lyrics in the song “Your Idol” reveals this is where they fall short. Keeping you in check, keeping you obsessed, Play me on repeat, endlessly in your head. Anytime it hurts, play another verse, I can be your sanctuary. Know I'm the only one right now. I will love you more when it all burns down, More than power, more than gold. Yeah, you gave me your heart, now I'm hеre for your soul. . . Your obsession feeds our connection. So right now give me all your attention. “It's often said that music is the language of the soul, and so it does feel very fitting that if you can tap into someone's emotions with music, you can pretty much do anything,” said Kang. “We see that with the Saja Boys too. They are tempting you into the underworld with their evilness. If you look at the Saja Boys' song, the lyrics are all about taking, and me consuming you, and you coming to me. That was purposely done because we wanted the songs to feel pretty shallow, really. The artist wasn't giving anything; they were just taking.”..."

n0i1h0b,2025-06-30 00:56:28,en,REDDIT,"  5 Discreet Signs You're in a Wealthy Person's Home Flashy indicators of affluence are easy to spot. But these often-less-expensive decor items signal true wealth in more subtle ways. By Faran Krentcil On TikTok and Bravo, moguls flaunt wealth conspicuously—the crystal is Austrian, the marble gleams so brightly you can see it from space. But the quietly ultra-rich live with subtler indicators of affluence—and most aren't actually that expensive. Here, some comparisons. Showy: Sferra Giza 45 Egyptian Cotton Sheets, which range from $788-$2,713 for a single flat sheet, have garnered over 35.6 million TikTok mentions—more for their extraordinary price point than their softness. D￼iscreet: For British royal residences, London designer Vicky Charles stocks London & Avalon's Heritage Egyptian Cotton Sheets ($204-$277 per flat sheet), and has them embroidered with a stripe across the bottom corner: red for king-size, blue for queen. “True luxury is time,” said Charles, “so why not save it?” Showy: For $399, Venus et Fleur yokes 42-49 identical preserved roses into a branded satin box. Noted in a description of Paris Hilton's home in Tatler magazine. D￼iscreet: Buy any local flowers two days before company arrives so they have time to open and “wilt a little,” said Jeffrey Bilhuber, a New York interior designer whose clients include hotel tycoon Jeff Klein and the late Hubert de Givenchy. In her New York apartment, Fendi heiress and fine art adviser Paola Saracino Fendi sets her humble bouquet in a vintage Roseville pottery vase ($200-$500). Showy: All-white Diptyque Gardenia candles ($76 for 6.5 ounces) boast the heady scent of the flower, as seen in Architectural Digest tours of Kim Kardashian's home. D￼iscreet: Soul Cycle founder Elizabeth P. Cutler tells us she stocks up on Flamingo Estate's Roma Heirloom Tomato Room Spray ($58 for 4 ounces), a lighter version of Loewe's cultish tomato-scent line, with notes of tarragon and citrus as well as the uncanny after-aroma of a tomato vine in summer. Showy: Hollywood types take to social media to tout the “electrolyte-balancing” benefit of cooking with Pink Himalayan Sea Salt. D￼iscreet: “You know someone has a trained personal chef when there's a giant box of kosher salt in the kitchen,” said Licia Householder, a trusted cook for Morgan Stanley VPs and their families during summer in the Hamptons. When working, Householder loads her car with boxes of the stuff. Kosher salt (at Walmart, $.35 an ounce vs. $.39 an ounce for pink) is less salty than other types, “so there's more control over the taste.” Showy: Staged for real estate ads, the skyscraper penthouses on New York's Billionaires' Row sport vaguely art deco crystal chandeliers (those from Lalique run about $114,000). D￼iscreet: Modernist metal lamps like those from Oluce (about $1,975) light the Miami Beach and Hamptons homes of Melissa Barrett MacLean, a partner at AOI Capital and former design director at Harper's Bazaar and Elle Decor. I feel like Carole would definitely use Loewe's tomato soap in her guest bathroom, and Adam would leave a big box of kosher salt in her kitchen pantry, but it's a no-go for wallpapered closets… at least per the WSJ."

The mum-of-two, 43, has been busy launching products under her As Ever brand label, and she made the remarks as she unveiled a new $30-a-bottle Rosé from California's Napa Valley. Meghan told fans: ""This blend captures the essence of celebration, inviting wine lovers to toast all the moments that matter most - both big and small."" The duchess launched her 2023 Napa Valley Rosé through a new wine section of her lifestyle brand's website, Wine.AsEver.com. It is being sold at $30 (£21) per bottle, with discounts for larger purchases -- a three-pack for $90 (£65), a half case for $159 (£115), or a full case for $300 (£218). Meghan is also preparing to release a sparkling wine under the same As Ever label. The wine is described on the site as ""a pale blush wine"" that offers ""roundness and depth of flavour"", with ""gentle minerality and soft notes of stone fruit with a lasting finish"". The bottle contains an ""As Ever blend"" of Cabernet Sauvignon, Mourvèdre, Grenache and Syrah grapes, which the site says creates a ""sophisticated, dry, and refreshing"" flavour designed for ""summer's best moments - from lunches that turn into dinners and sun-drenched weekends where the only thing louder than the music is the laughter"". Meghan's return to the business world comes amid renewed speculation around her and Prince Harry, 40, potentially seeking a path back to the royal family. The couple stepped down from royal duties in 2020 and now reside in California with their two children, Prince Archie and Princess Lilibet. But notes newly published by royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith have shed further light on the reaction of Queen Elizabeth II to the couple's departure -- often referred to as ""Megxit"". In one passage, the Queen, who died in September 2022, reportedly told her cousin and confidante Lady Elizabeth Anson she was ""not at all content"". According to Bedell Smith's Extra Substack blog, Lady Elizabeth, who died in 2020 aged 79, told her: ""Harry was rude to (the Queen) for 10 minutes."" The notes also describe tensions leading up to Meghan and Harry's 2018 wedding. Meghan, it is said, would not reveal details about her dress to the Queen. Lady Elizabeth reportedly told the biographer: ""Meghan wouldn't tell her Queen Elizabeth II about the wedding dress."" The dress, a Givenchy design with a bateau neckline and three-quarter sleeves, was ultimately viewed by the Queen as ""flamboyant"" and, according to the notes, she felt it was ""not fit for a divorcee"". Meghan had previously been married to film producer Trevor Engelson. Lady Elizabeth also told Bedell Smith: ""The jury (was) out on whether she likes Meghan."" The Queen, according to the interview, was ""so saddened"" by the Sussexes' decision to leave royal life behind, the biographer wrote."
1lpdp44,2025-07-01 21:15:15,en,REDDIT,"  I'm one of those people who goes full tunnel vision whenever a new hobby catches my eye. I've flirted with coin collecting, dipped my toes into sneakers, and gotten somewhat into watches (budget's not allowing me to get too deep into this one). But for the past year, it's been all about fragrances—and honestly, aside from watches, this one's been the most fun. I've always had a soft spot for good scents. As a kid, my options were limited to budget bangers like Fogg and Axe. Occasionally, I'd sneak a few sprays from my dad's One Man Show by Jacques Bogart—which, in Bangladesh, was THE dad scent and I still enjoyed it. During my high school and college days, my dad gifted me a few designer fragrances—CK One, CH Men, Givenchy Gentlemen Only Absolute, Boss Bottled EDT, Emporio Armani… lui. I held onto each of them dearly—not just because they were gifts, but because they're what lit the spark. At the time, dropping more than $50 on a fragrance felt like a full-blown luxury. Even a year ago, I'd hesitate before going over $100. But post-graduation, once I landed a job, I figured—why not treat myself? I dove into YouTube reviews, fell hard for the Middle Eastern fragrance hype, and picked up 9PM, Hawas, Khamrah, Bade al Oud the usual suspects. Had a blast with them. Then I ventured into more mainstream designer stuff—Eros, Rabanne Victory Extreme… but they didn't hit like I hoped. That's when I started craving something different—something I hadn't smelled on every guy in a party or hangout . I slowly unfollowed the “Top 10 panty droppers” crowd and moved away from the hype-chasing echo chamber. I began doing my own research, dug into deeper reviews, curbed the blind buys, and started really learning. These days, I enjoy watching folks like Daniel from Seldomly Often, Sebastian from The Perfume Guy, Marcelo from The Niche Fragrance Collector, Justin from The Stay Fresh Production, and Alavi from Persolaise. No fluff, just passion and perspective. What's been especially refreshing is how welcoming the local fragrance community is. Compared to some hobbies that can get a bit… elitist, this one feels more open. Sure, some fragheads can be snobbish too, but I've had pretty smooth sailing so far. So here we are—a year and a month into this olfactory rabbit hole, and I'm loving every step. The failed blind buys, the hype traps, the unexpected gems—it's all part of the ride. I've sold off a few misses, gifted a couple to my brother and dad, and what's left are the ones I actually reach for and enjoy. There are still a few bottles I've got my eye on—ones that feel like missing pieces of my current collection. Once I grab those, I'll probably hit pause for a bit and shift focus to other priorities. Until then, I'll keep enjoying what I've already got on the shelf."

mov_526498EC64897596F08DBE3EFC42F22C,2025-07-02 13:02:34,fr,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[fr]Depuis 2015, Sam Zirah s'investit pleinement dans la production, la réalisation et la présentation de ses émissions diffusées sur sa chaîne YouTube. D'abord focalisé sur le domaine de la téléréalité, dont il est devenu une référence incontournable et un passage obligé pour les protagonistes, le Montpelliérain s'est récemment diversifié en recevant notamment des politiques. Avec plus de deux millions d'abonnés, ses émissions cumulent chaque semaine des centaines de milliers de vues. Dans « En toute intimité », Sam Zirah prend le temps d'échanger en face-à-face avec ses invités. Des entretiens dans un climat de bienveillance où il ose poser toutes les questions. Son talk-show « Au jour d'aujourd'hui » consacré à l'actualité du monde de la téléréalité, qu'il anime aux côtés d'une équipe de chroniqueurs, est devenu un rendez-vous hebdomadaire attendu et apprécié fort de plus de 200 numéros. Il y a neuf mois, il a lancé « Chez Zirah », un format d'interview consacré aux personnalités sortant de la sphère de la téléréalité. En l'espace de seize numéros, il a notamment reçu Sébastien Delogu, Manon Aubry, Louis Boyard, Sébastien Chenu, Yaël Braun-Pivet, Julien Odoul, Rima Hassan et Arthur Delaporte dans le registre politique ainsi qu'Harry Roselmack pour la partie médias et l'avocate Nadia El Bouroumi. Sam Zirah nous a reçus dans ses locaux parisiens et nous raconte son parcours. » LIRE AUSSI - Lancement de sa chaîne YouTube en 2015 « Une des clés de la réussite d'un projet, c'est l'investissement et surtout la régularité. Au-delà de la motivation et de l'énergie, j'ai commencé avec l'idée de produire une émission par semaine. Ma première invitée était Aurélie Preston, candidate des “Marseillais” . Mon concept d'interview était de m'adresser à des personnalités de téléréalité comme un animateur télé pourrait le faire avec n'importe quelle célébrité : avec curiosité et considération. C'était une époque où la téléréalité était souvent traitée de manière légère et trash. Ce qui a dénoté au début, c'est que je vouvoyais mes interlocuteurs. Je tenais cela de mes années dans le milieu du prêt-à-porter de luxe où le vouvoiement était de rigueur. » Création de sa société 2ZS Production « J'ai commencé en autoentrepreneur jusqu'à ce que mon père me conseille de créer une structure et m'aide à monter ma société en février 2017. Tous les noms qui me plaisaient étaient déjà pris. Comme nous étions le père et le fils dans cette création d'entreprise, c'est devenu 2ZS Production, comme deux Zirah. » Une enfance dans le sud de la France « Je suis né à Montpellier. J'ai une sœur aînée et je suis tonton de deux petites-nièces que j'adore, une qui vient d'avoir 15 ans et une de 4 ans. Mon père est un entrepreneur dans l'âme, je l'ai toujours connu chef d'entreprise. Il a commencé de zéro et a réussi à créer une société très innovante pour l'époque dans la gestion électronique des files d'attente. Aujourd'hui, il a 140 salariés. J'ai toujours été admiratif de son parcours. Il rêvait de faire ce que je fais aujourd'hui mais il ne pouvait pas car il est sourd de naissance . Ma maman a toujours été là pour ma sœur et moi, elle était à la maison pour s'occuper de nous. Elle nous apportait beaucoup d'amour. » Une scolarité difficile « Comme beaucoup de timides et d'introvertis, je voulais faire quelque chose dans la représentation, je voulais être comédien. J'ai eu mon bac L, option arts plastiques, je suis parti à Paris un an après et j'ai fait le cours Florent. À l'école, je devais travailler énormément pour obtenir des résultats très moyens contrairement à ma sœur qui lisait une page deux fois et qui la connaissait par cœur. J'étais épileptique de mes 7 à mes 13 ans. Les neurologues avaient expliqué à ma mère que mon traitement créait des problèmes de concentration et je n'arrivais pas à apprendre mes leçons. C'était très dur pour moi. Je me sentais bête de ne pas réussir à apprendre. » De la comédie au monde de la mode « Je me suis rendu compte que la comédie n'était pas faite pour moi. Cela allait être très difficile parce que j'étais plus efféminé que les autres, j'avais plus de manières sans le faire exprès. J'avais mon accent du sud. Contrairement à d'autres, mon orientation se voyait et c'était difficile de jouer les jeunes premiers quand tu n'es pas crédible. En parallèle, j'ai travaillé dans le prêt-à-porter de luxe, j'aimais bien représenter et cela a plu à l'industrie du luxe. J'ai travaillé dans les cosmétiques chez Sephora, j'ai appris à maquiller sur le tas. Puis j'ai été vendeur chez Givenchy, ça a été extraordinaire. À 23 ans, je suis devenu directeur adjoint de trois boutiques Burberry puis directeur de ma propre boutique pour la marque Chloé. Au bout de quatre mois, j'ai tout stoppé. Ce que je voulais, c'était créer. » Accro aux vidéos « Quand j'étais petit, je fabriquais des sagas de l'été avec la caméra de mon père, je faisais tourner mes meilleurs amis et je les interviewais. J'avais inventé une société de production qui s'appelait ZS Company. J'ai continué à créer des contenus en grandissant et à faire mes petits montages. Après avoir arrêté mon travail pour Chloé, j'ai postulé pour la chaîne Non Stop People , j'ai été appelé en plein mois d'août, je me suis rendu à Paris et trois jours après, j'étais retenu pour enregistrer le pilote du “JT de la téléréalité”. C'est comme ça que je suis resté trois ans sur cette chaîne en tant que chroniqueur. Je me suis régalé. » Un enfant de « Loft Story » « Le Loft, c'était le gros phénomène...."

Le mannequin italien portait la pièce d'archives d'un événement post-mariage à Venise pour le fondateur d'Amazon Jeff Bezos et sa nouvelle épouse, Lauren Sánchez Bezos. La robe frappante a connu son premier moment de tapis rouge en 2003, lorsque le mannequin brésilien Gisele Bündchen, alors la petite amie de Leonardo DiCaprio, l'a porté au Met Gala. Maintenant, plus de deux décennies plus tard, il est de retour à l'honneur sur un autre partenaire de l'acteur. Archive sur la haute couture Le port de la mode archivistique rare est devenu un mouvement de prestige parmi les célébrités de la liste A, signalant la maîtrise de la mode et l'exclusivité. Contrairement aux pièces vintage, généralement plus de 20 ans, les vêtements d'archives se réfèrent souvent à des pièces de passerelle en édition limitée considérées comme de l'art portable. “Quelque chose de rare de l'histoire de la mode est un autre type de vantardise”, a déclaré Gill Linton, PDG de Byronesque, une plate-forme dédiée à la mode archivistique. “Les vêtements sont des célébrités à part entière, pour rendre les gens plus authentiques qu'ils ne le sont réellement.” Ceretti, qui a ensuite partagé des images de coutures déchirées de la robe délicate Instagramsemblait imperturbable par sa fragilité. Le moment a renforcé son image en tant que fabricant de goût moderne plutôt que comme un plus-un. Les célébrités rivalisent dans le jeu des archives Ceretti n'était pas le seul à choisir une pièce avec l'histoire. Kendall et Kylie Jenner portaient tous deux l'archivage Roberto Cavalli aux événements de pré-mariage, tandis que Sánchez portait un 2003 Alexander McQueen Habillez-vous pour un dîner pré-cérémonie. D'autres stars ont adopté des choix similaires: Naomi Campbell a renoncé à une robe Chanel Couture qu'elle a modélisée en 1996 à Cannes l'année dernière. Jennifer Lawrence a enfilé une robe en dentelle Givenchy précédemment portée par Kate Moss sur le défilé en 1996. Sabrina Carpenter stupéfaite dans une robe Bob Mackie autrefois portée par Madonna aux Oscars de 1991. Les risques de la réévolution de l'histoire Bien que la mode d'archives offre du prestige, il apporte également des risques. En 2022, Kim Kardashian a été critiquée pour avoir porté la robe Bob Mackie de 4 millions de livres sterling de Marilyn Monroe au Met Gala, ce qui soulève des préoccupations concernant les dommages potentiels aux vêtements historiques. La robe déchirée de Ceretti peut mettre en évidence les limites de la mode fragile du stockage et des tapis rouges modernes. Cependant, son choix souligne une tendance croissante: l'authenticité et le patrimoine de la mode ont maintenant plus de poids que de simplement porter les nouveaux designs. Une déclaration de style avec un but Pour Ceretti, qui a été vu plus tard à Venise portant une années 1990 Betsey Johnson habiller, l'engagement à archiver la mode semble intentionnel. Avec des stylistes qui organisaient ces looks pour soutenir la marque personnelle, porter la mode avec une trame de fond n'est pas seulement le glamour; C'est une déclaration stratégique. #petite #amie #Leonardo #DiCaprio #porte #robe #emblématique #Dolce #Gabbana #Gisele #Bündchen #Gisele #Bündchen #Met #Gala 2025-07-02 14"
mov_AB28BCB31E9E0514AAFCF92C6D454F1F,2025-07-02 17:12:53,en,WEB,"  They say, fashion comes its fair share of faux pas and flair! While luxurious wardrobes and style statements speak for the 'flair' part, the faux pas part most certainly includes the mispronunciations of the well-known fashion brands (despite those being extremely famous). And while these mishaps are quite cliché, they're not chic at all. Because let's be honest – in the world of fashion, half the battle is looking the part, and the rest of it is acing the etiquette (which includes the correct pronunciation of popular fashion brands). Mispronouncing a luxury label can cost you credibility faster than you can say “Céline.” Lucky for you, we've done the hard work. From Parisian labels to Italian icons and streetwear staples, this guide is sprinkled with phonetic line-drawing, brand backstories, and quirky insider tips to help you glide through any style conversation with ease. So, say goodbye to awkward pauses and hello to stylish confidence – let's break it down, brand by brand. French elegance: Subtle, chic, and tricky Hermès – Not “Her-meez,” but gentle vowel start, silent 'H' and 's': “air‑MEZ” or “er‑MEZ”, not “her‑meez.” Givenchy – Often butchered as “Gah‑vin‑chee.” The correct French flourish? “zhee‑VOHN‑shee”, with soft 'G', nasal 'on', and a gentle final “‑shee.” Chanel – Forget “Shan‑elle.” The proper style? “SHUH‑nel.” Chic, crisp, simple, and oh-so‑Parisian. Balmain – Yes, it's not “BAL‑mayn.” Roll it out like “bal‑MAH”, trailing off the 'n' softly for that French flair. Yves Saint Laurent – Drop those hard Ts! The smooth version: “EEV san‑loh‑rah(n)”, a lovers' lane nasal finish. Christian Louboutin – Strut smoothly: “kris‑tee‑ahn loo‑boo‑TAHN”, not “tin.” Christian Lacroix – “LA-kwa.” So “kris‑tee‑ahn luh‑kwa”, rolling that l–r combo beautifully. Comme des Garçons – Play it subtly: “comb‑DAY gar‑SON”, letting the 's' fade, nasal 'on' intact. Italian icons: Bold, bright, and vowely Gucci – It's “GOO‑chee”, emphasis on the first syllable, never “Goo‑kee.” Versace – Despite the trendy slip, it's properly “ver‑SAH‑cheh.” Donatella herself has piped up to confirm it. Prada – Simple and sweet: “PRAH‑dah”, sturdy first syllable, light second. Moschino – The fun-filled style comes through in “mos‑KEY‑no”, not “mos‑chee‑no.” Bottega Veneta – Soft and elegant: “boh‑TEH‑gah veh‑NEH‑ta”, a solid roll in every segment. Dolce & Gabbana – Smooth Italian gloss: “DOL‑chay eh ga‑BAN‑eh”, not “Gab‑anna.” Spanish flair and subtle sound Balenciaga – Spanish royalty. Break it into “bah‑LEN‑see‑AH‑gah,” emphasizing the “AH” and smoothing past the “cia.” Loewe – Spanish elegance meets German twist: say “lo‑WEH‑vay”, not “low‑eeve.” Athleisure staples Adidas – A German classic: “AH‑dee‑dahs”, emphasis on the first syllable, founder Adi Dassler's namesake. Nike – Named after the Greek goddess, it's “NY‑kee”, not “Nighk.” Porsche – Elegant German soap-opera: “POR‑shuh”, with a soft “‑uh” ending. Cross-cultural gems Bvlgari (Latin-script brand) – Pronounce “BOOL‑gah‑ree,” highlighting the “u” after “B.” Cartier – Soft, refined: “kar‑tee‑AY”, not “Car‑tee‑er.” Jacquemus – From French fashion forward: “ZHAK‑moose.” Celine – A blend of syllables: “seh‑LEEN,” soft start, piercing end. Nailing the correct pronunciation of a fashion might seem like a superficial conquest – but it isn't just about speaking the name; it's about stepping into the essence of each brand. Elevating your fashion conversations goes beyond clothes – it's about knowing the names and pronouncing them with confidence, creativity, and cultural awareness. From the sonorous softness of French designers to the vibrant clarity of Italian labels, each namescape tells a story – learn the sound, share the style. With this guide, you're not just knocking it out of the vocabulary park; you're stepping onto the stylistic stage with poise and pizzazz...."

For me, #fashion has always been something deeper, something closer to the soul – an escape, an aspiration, an art form woven into the fabric of memory and culture. Growing up in #Haiti, particularly during the era leading up to the mid-1980s, presented a complex picture of fashion. In the middle-class environment where my early years were spent, there was an undeniable exposure to high society and, with it, a glimpse into the world of high fashion. This was the time when figures like Michèle Bennett Duvalier, the First Lady, were known for their lavish tastes, reportedly spending astronomical sums on Haute Couture from European houses and exquisite jewelry. (Research confirms Michelle #Duvalier's significant spending on designers like GIVENCHY and Boucheron , making her a symbol of that era's connection to global luxury).

As the industry's model for working with public figures shifts, the power dynamics are becoming increasingly unclear. On Friday in Paris, the Northern Irish designer Jonathan Anderson will show his first collection as the creative director of the French fashion house Dior. During his previous, 11-year tenure as the creative director of the Spanish brand Loewe, Anderson became known for his avant-garde sensibility and dedication to craft -- but also for his unique ability to turn the internet's so-called boyfriends (those young actors and musicians who are lusted over online with possessive familiarity) into bona fide celebrities. In the front row of Anderson's fall 2024 Loewe men's wear show in Paris were the established actors Jamie Dornan, Andrew Garfield and Nicholas Hoult, but also, seated with equal prominence, emerging ones, including Drew Starkey, who was set to star in ''Queer'' (the 2024 Luca Guadagnino movie for which Anderson oversaw the costumes), and Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist, who would soon appear as romantic leads in Guadagnino's film ''Challengers,'' a film that helped them reach mainstream heartthrob status, and with which Anderson was also involved as a costume designer. The following June, at Anderson's final Loewe men's runway show, the rising actors Kit Connor, Evan Peters and Enzo Vogrincic sat front row -- suggesting, based on the strength of the designer's track record, that they too would also soon become leading men. For Loewe, it was a display of cultural currency; for the actors, it was free publicity. It used to be that an association with a brand was, if not a career-killer, then certainly not chic for an actor. It was hard to be taken seriously as both an artist and a de facto fashion model. But in recent decades, the rise of social media and the expansion of the fashion industry have blurred the lines between model, actor and influencer. Back in the 1980s, the Italian fashion house Armani began dressing Hollywood celebrities, including, most notably, Richard Gere for his role in the 1980 movie ''American Gigolo.'' But gone are the days when one megastar served as a company's global face. Today brands adopt a multitiered system of ambassadors that includes international stars, yes, but also up-and-comers and influencers. While these cliques are often described by their members and parent brands as ''family,'' and frequently represent a genuine affinity, they are also carefully constructed to maximize a company's exposure on red carpets and billboards -- but also very specific corners of TikTok. Now, as this business decision solidifies into standard practice, the question is, Who ultimately wields the power, the celebrities or the brands? Until 2010, ''a few brands had ambassadors, but it was mainly for fragrance,'' says Ben Cercio, the founder of a consulting agency specializing in brand strategy and communications with clients including the French fashion house Givenchy. But with the launch of Instagram that year, a shift occurred: companies began to engage not just with major actors but also with ''microinfluencers'' -- online personalities with less than 100,000 followers -- to reach their audiences early on. And because social media has accelerated the rise to fame, whenever a new talent in any field emerges from the crowd, ''every brand wants to get its hands on them,'' says Cercio. Now an ingénue like the actress Mikey Madison, who starred in last year's ''Anora,'' might have a dozen offers from brands immediately after making a buzzy debut at a festival like Cannes, suggesting that it's often the young actors, rather than the brands, who are in control. When Madison accepted her Oscar for best lead actress in March, she wore a custom look from Dior. Cercio adds that while relationships once developed organically -- a talent would come to a fashion show, be given some pieces and maybe wear something from the latest collection on the red carpet -- increasingly, ''money is very quickly involved.'' Indeed, an ambassadorship is now a coveted deal among celebrities of all tiers. '' There's enough proof in the market of just how great a partnership can look,'' says George Georgopoulos, the director of brand partnerships at Huxley, an agency that represents artists including Charli XCX. After releasing her globally successful album ''Brat,'' last summer, the pop star partnered with companies from H&M to Acne Studios and performed with a seemingly empty Gucci bag on ''Saturday Night Live'' in what appeared to be a wink-wink placement. (She'd headlined the brand's annual LACMA Gala a few weeks before.) Getting a check for simply holding an object, she seemed to imply, was not selling out but making the system work for her. For many celebrities, ''there's more money in the ambassadorship than in a lot of the payments they receive for their work onscreen,'' says the writer and pop culture podcaster Evan Ross Katz. Those funds can free up major actors to pursue less commercial projects, like indie films and plays; they are also increasingly essential for younger performers who aren't yet earning large sums for their creative work. Depending on their level of fame, a celebrity can make anywhere from $50,000 to many millions of dollars with endorsement deals, according to several people who work on confidential contracts. On the lower end are social media posts: An artist with a significant following could be paid $100,000 to $150,000 for a single main-grid post holding a product and tagging a brand. If their following is in the multiple millions, however, these numbers can reach seven figures, one stylist said. Slightly more lucrative are red-carpet appearances. And on the higher end are elaborate contracts that require more than just showing up at Fashion Week twice a year. A deal worth around $3 million, for example, could involve appearing in advertising campaigns, attending events like store openings, being dressed for the red carpet, wearing the brand out more casually for paparazzi shots and creating several social media posts. The prestige of an endorsement deal can also boost the cachet of a relatively unknown artist or internet personality immeasurably. Katz cites the YouTuber Emma Chamberlain and the pop star Addison Rae as two recent examples of social media stars whose fame has grown well beyond their original audience, partly because of their fashion partnerships. Since 2019, Chamberlain has been an ambassador for Louis Vuitton; last year, Rae appeared in a campaign film for Saint Laurent. Likewise, while celebrity ambassadors might not necessarily move units for brands in the short term -- unless they have the influence of a Kardashian or a Hadid -- they give companies exposure to niche but devoted audiences. By putting the actor Jeremy Allen White on a billboard, for example, Calvin Klein helped transform a nascent sex symbol into the kind of established idol the brand more typically casts -- and it got to be a part of the cultural conversation following the success of White's show ''The Bear.'' And when, last summer, Marc Jacobs recruited the viral TikTok chef Nara Smith to ''make'' one of the brand's tote bags from baking ingredients in a tongue-in-cheek video, Smith gained fashion credibility, while the brand got to create a social media moment of its own. Both parties signaled that they were in on the joke. But not all relationships are the right match. '' I remember this desire for fashion to lead the conversation and not follow it,'' says Katz.

VOGUE verrät, wie sie jetzt kombiniert werden. Diese 5 Schuhe aus den 80ern liegen jetzt wieder im Trend! Die Mode der 80er-Jahre ist schwer zu vergessen – die Schulterpolster zum Beispiel oder die knalligen Farben. Aber auch die ausgefallenen Schuhe aus dem vergangenen Jahrzehnt sind legendär und werden im Sommer 2025 wieder rauf und runter getragen – darunter Ballerinas, Slingbacks oder zweifarbige Pumps. VOGUE verrät, welche Modelle zurück auf dem Laufsteg – und der Straße – sind und wie sie heute kombiniert werden. 5 Modelle aus den 80ern, die im Sommer 2025 wieder angesagt sind #1 Ballerinas In den 30er-Jahren lancierten Designer:innen wie Christian Dior, Elsa Schiaparelli und Yves Saint Laurent die ersten Ballerinas, die nicht nur für ihre Eleganz, sondern auch für ihren Komfort gefeiert wurden. Später dann, in den 80er-Jahren, war auch Prinzessin Diana ein großer Fan der Silhouette; während Kate Moss und Alexa Chung in den späten 2000er- und frühen 2010er-Jahren zu den Anhängerinnen gehörten. Perry Ellis stellte 1987 ein schlichtes weißes Modell vor, das sie gepaart mit einem weißen, geradlinigen Look über den Laufsteg schickte. Nachdem die Modelle dann einige Jahre von der Bildfläche verschwunden waren, bahnten sie sich in den letzten Saisons ihren Weg zurück an die Spitze. Während in den 80er-Jahren aber vorrangig klassische Designs im Vordergrund standen, zeigen sich die Ballerinas heute verspielter – zum Beispiel aus Mesh oder PVC, mit Leoparden- oder Reptilmuster. Bei Chloé präsentierte Chemena Kamali beispielsweise eine geschnürte Boho-Version der Schuhe, die sie zu einem fließenden roséfarbenen Set kombinierte. #2 Slingbacks Apropos elegante Schuhe: Slingback-Modelle, also jene mit Riemchen um die Ferse, gehörten in den 80er-Jahren zur Arbeitsuniform der Frauen. 1987, als das sogenannte Power-Dressing in vollem Gange war, brauchte man ein Design, das bequem, aber dennoch formell war. So wählte Giorgio Armani für seine Kollektion im besagten Jahr Slingbacks, die er zu einer Bundfaltenhose, einer Bluse und einem Blazer mit breiten Schulterpolstern kombinierte. In 2025 kommen Slingbacks besonders gerne mit Kitten Heels daher – wie Marken wie Jacquemus, Contessa Mills und Tamara Ralph bestätigen. Letztere setzte auf eine schwarze Variante der Slingbacks und kombinierte sie mit einer samtigen Off-Shoulder-Bluse und einem Midirock mit Perlenverzierung. #3 T-Steg-Sandalen Sich von vergangenen Jahrzehnten inspirieren zu lassen, ist kein neues Konzept. Und während die Mode der 80er-Jahre der Welt eine Mischung aus Opulenz, Sinnlichkeit und Dramatik bescherte, brachte sie auch viele Elemente der 20er-Jahre zurück – wie lange Halsketten und T-Steg-Sandalen. Givenchy stellte in 1988 beispielsweise ein mit Polka Dots verziertes Modell vor – in Kombination mit einem trägerlosen Kleid im gleichen Muster. Es gab eine Zeit, in der Schuhe mit T-Steg als altmodisch galten. Jetzt, im Sommer 2025, finden die geschichtsträchtigen und mühelos eleganten Schuhe wieder Anklang. Christopher Esber, eine Marke mit australischen Wurzeln, verlieh ihnen mit einer Mesh-Variante und gestylt zum minimalistischen Ensemble aus einem weißen Neckholdertop und einer schwarzen Stoffhose einen modernen Dreh. #4 Oxford-Schuhe In den späten 80er-Jahren begann sich langsam der Minimalismus, der die nächsten Jahre prägen sollte, zu etablieren. Ein Stil, der sich durch androgyne Accessoires – wie zum Beispiel die Oxford-Schuhe – bemerkbar machte. Ralph Lauren hatte sie 1985 bereits mit Absatz vorgestellt; Helmut Lang und Yohji Yamamoto verwischten die Geschlechtergrenzen dann mit Versionen, die fast identisch zu den Herrenschuhen waren. Lang kombinierte sie mit einem langärmeligen Rollkragenkleid, Yamamoto mit einer weißen Oversize-Weste und einem blauen Satinrock. Oxford-Schuhe zogen sich wie ein roter Faden durch die Frühjahr/Sommer-Kollektion 2025 von Loewe. Anstatt sie wie damals zu ebenso androgynen Looks zu stylen, sorgte Jonathan Anderson für einen Stilbruch und kombinierte sie zu romantisch-verspielten Blumen- und Babydoll-Kleidern. #5 Zweifarbige Pumps Das Chanel der 80er-Jahre verkörperte einen Luxus, der sich durch Tweed-Sets, Perlenschmuck – und zweifarbige Pumps auszeichnete. Gründerin Coco Chanel trug oft selbst ein Paar mit niedrigem Absatz. 1982 (ein Jahr bevor Karl Lagerfeld zum französischen Modehaus stieß) sah man zweifarbige Pumps in Kombination mit einem weißen Kleid, einem schwarzen Blazer, Handschuhen, Gürteln und langen Perlenketten auf dem Laufsteg. Während diese klassischen schwarz-cremefarbenen Pumps weiterhin bei Chanel zu sehen sind, gibt es Häuser wie Nina Ricci oder Balmain, die die zweifarbigen Modelle ausgefallener – aber immer noch im gleichen Stil – interpretieren. Balmain setzte für den Sommer 2025 beispielsweise auf eine rot-goldene Version, gepaart mit einem Tweed-Minirock und einer passenden Jacke."

UgwBOtGCnvh9_iYFOAl4AaABAg,2025-07-04 13:20:51,en,YOUTUBE,"  The story (allegedly) at one point was that Harry was having doubts even after the engagement, and MM announced she was pregnant which is why the wedding was pushed ahead of Eugenie's wedding. My understanding is that Eugenie and Jack were meant to be getting married before H and M… Allegedly she left that room in her ill fitting dress in case there was a bump but unfortunately by the wedding there was no longer a baby, and even though she could have had the dress adjusted, I have no doubt she would have left it there to mess with H's head. Who would leave that amount of fabric on the stomach area of a Givenchy wedding gown? It just doesn't make sense unless there was an ulterior motive for leaving it there. There are no lengths she wouldn't go to, to get her place on the world wide stage. This all sort of makes sense to me, and would certainly be a reason for her not wanting to share details with Queen Elizabeth. I don't think it was a known thing that she was pregnant, I mean by the family, but I can imagine she made Harry put a rush on the wedding. Has anyone else heard this version of events? What infuriates me is that £32 million 'spectacle' was unnecessary as they had been told  y the Queen that they could have a discreet wedding anywhere they wanted, and that the big Royal wedding wasn't  necessary if they didn't want one."

Her base was SOSOSO pretty, like a real life filter. I asked the makeup artist wtf she did to make her skin so pretty? She said she just used the Flawless Filter all over, a concealer, and three different powders (Chanel, YSL, and the OG Givenchy) to mattify the majority of the face. I can't express how pretty that looked. Also my holy grail foundation till the end of times is the Armani Luminous Silk.

mov_85B88F3879C3CC38867E972D4AA36CAD,2025-07-04 17:27:37,en,WEB,"  Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride. While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb - without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries, working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand - one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow, or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets it as a gown, be happy. One would be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires, but it has only two global consumer brands. Having a large home market - by volume, not value - our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts - a net $90 bn deficit. It doesn't help that India's GI regulation is the weakest form of 'sui-generis protection mechanism', as Akriti and Pinaki Ghosh wrote in 2024 in 'Challenges in the Utilization of GI Registration for Capitalizing GI Products', in Journal of Intellectual Property Rights. Lack of enforceability dilutes 'transparency, fairness, effectiveness, and accountability - pillars of good governance', they argue. Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous statutory drafting, sloppy marketing and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations to spur the ages- old artisanship and economically uplift kolhapuri makers. None of the large Indian business groups - those even in fashion or retail - have come forward yet to safeguard their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled sarees as part of a sustainability project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration of iconic monuments and archaeological sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship. From sarees to shoes, music to movies, we hardly prize our handlooms or history, artisans or antiquities. We do not appreciate our own, till the world appreciates it. Oddly enough, while we seek outside validation, we also get easily enraged. Satyajit Ray was 'extremely discouraged' by the initial reception of Pather Panchali in India, Kolkata included. International acclaim, starting with Best Human Document Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, turned the tide. It took America-born Sally Holkar to revive Maheshwari weaves, or John Bissell to create a brand for our fabrics in Fabindia. Delhi-based Scot William Dalrymple has taken India's primordial gift for myth and narrative to make scholarship in history accessible. While the renaissance of modern Indian art owes much to Japanese businessman Masanori Fukuoka. Unless we own, defend and develop our own value chains, we shall continue to let our misplaced chauvinism get the better of us. The devil doesn't just wear Prada."

Ugz3hXjCy1NRN9ffUvt4AaABAg,2025-07-04 23:52:18,en,YOUTUBE,"  I find it odd that this story comes out a few years after Queen Elizabeth and her cousin are both dead. There could be a kernel of truth there because I believe the Royal Family was divided on their opinions on Meghan's suitability as Harry's bride ……she was biracial, divorced and an actress. It would seem to be in character with the Queen to try to broker a peace. My guess is she asked her cousin to try and exert some control over the ceremony and tone it down and perhaps change the venue. Harry wrote in Spare that William thought a small country church near Highgrove would be more appropriate than St George's . Maybe a quieter reception in the garden at Highgrove. No TV and just a few media photographers. It sounds like Queen would have preferred Meghan in a cream colored suit and no tiara since she was divorced. Definitely no Givenchy wedding dress and veil."

While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb — without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries,   working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch   and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand — one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary   topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western   couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow,   or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri   has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets   it as a gown, be happy. One would   be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires,   but it has only two global consumer   brands. Having a large home market — by volume, not value — our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts   — a net $90 bn deficit. It doesn't help that India's GI regulation   is the weakest form of 'sui-generis   protection mechanism', as Akriti and Pinaki Ghosh wrote in 2024 in 'Challenges in the Utilization of GI Registration for Capitalizing GI Products',   in Journal of Intellectual Property   Rights. Lack of enforceability dilutes 'transparency, fairness, effectiveness,   and accountability — pillars of good governance', they argue. Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single   malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous   statutory drafting, sloppy marketing   and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative   zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism   of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace   and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations   to spur the ages old   artisanship and economically   uplift kolhapuri   makers. None of the large Indian business groups — those even in fashion or retail — have come forward yet to safeguard   their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative   process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled   sarees as part of a sustainability   project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration   of iconic monuments and archaeological   sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve   or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship. From sarees to shoes, music to movies, we hardly prize our handlooms or history, artisans or antiquities. We do not appreciate our own, till the world appreciates it. Oddly enough, while we seek outside validation, we also get easily enraged. Satyajit Ray was 'extremely discouraged'   by the initial reception of Pather Panchali in India, Kolkata included.

mov_DD5460C3F6890BB8502192BE529181DA,2025-07-05 06:24:07,fa,WEB,  SPR_COMBO[fa]به گزارش خبرنگار اقتصادی خبرگزاری تسنیم؛ صنعت نساجی ایران، با وجود تمام چالش‌های محیطی و سیاسی، از جمله تحریم‌های بین‌المللی، دارای ظرفیت‌های فراوان و مزیت‌های نسبی منحصر به فردی است که کمتر به آن توجه شده است. این ظرفیت‌ها که از منابع طبیعی، نیروی انسانی خلاق و بازار مصرف داخلی نشأت می‌گیرد، همراه با توانمندی‌های فناورانه و ابتکارات نوآورانه، زمینه‌ساز رشد و توسعه پایدار در این صنعت می‌باشد. نگاه به بیرون و انتظار رفع تحریم‌ها یا مذاکرات بین‌المللی هرگز نباید نقطه اتکا و راه‌حل اصلی توسعه صنعت نساجی ایران باشد. بلکه باید با اتکا به دارایی‌های خود و استفاده هوشمندانه از فرصت‌های بومی و جهانی، مسیری مستقل و مقتدرانه برای پیشرفت این صنعت طراحی کنیم.  در این مقاله با مرور 40 ظرفیت کلیدی ایران و 27 ابتکار عمل در صنعت نساجی در سطح جهانی، چارچوبی عملیاتی و مبتنی بر واقعیت‌های کشور ارائه شده که می‌تواند ایران را از بند محدودیت‌ها رها ساخته و به جایگاه واقعی خود در بازارهای جهانی برساند. در همین زمینه بیشتر بخوانید الف) 28 تجربه جهانی در صنعت پوشاک و نساجی 1. انگلستان – آغاز صنعتی‌سازی با صنعت نساجی در انقلاب صنعتی قرن 18 انگلستان نخستین کشوری بود که در اواخر قرن 18 با بهره‌گیری از ماشین بخار و سازماندهی کارخانه‌ای، صنعت نساجی را به نقطه آغاز انقلاب صنعتی تبدیل کرد. توسعه ماشین‌های بافندگی، پیدایش کارخانه‌های متمرکز در منچستر و لیدز، و بهره‌برداری از استعمار هند به‌عنوان منبع پنبه خام، این کشور را در قرن 19 به قطب بی‌بدیل تولید پارچه بدل کرد. دولت بریتانیا با حفاظت از نوآوری‌های تکنولوژیک (مانند ماشین اسپینینگ جنی) و ممنوعیت صادرات ابزار تولید تا مدت‌ها از سلطه خود دفاع کرد. تجربه بریتانیا نشان می‌دهد که نساجی می‌تواند پیشران توسعه صنعتی و آغازگر زنجیره‌های بزرگ اشتغال باشد. 2. هند – احیای صنعت نساجی در قرن بیست و یکم با تمرکز بر پنبه و صادرات هند در سال‌های اخیر با صادرات بیش از 40 میلیارد دلار پوشاک و پارچه، به یکی از غول‌های جهانی در صنعت نساجی تبدیل شده است. این کشور با بهره‌گیری از پنبه داخلی، نیروی کار ارزان، و سیاست‌های حمایتی از زنجیره تولید، به‌ویژه در ایالت‌هایی مانند تامیل‌نادو، گجرات و ماهاراشترا، توانسته است مزیت مقیاس را تثبیت کند. نهادهایی مانند وزارت نساجی هند با ارائه یارانه صادرات، تسهیل‌گری در تأسیس پارک‌های صنعتی و ایجاد زنجیره‌های خوشه‌ای، این صنعت را به یکی از پایه‌های توسعه منطقه‌ای تبدیل کرده‌اند. هند همچنین با توسعه برندهای داخلی مانند FabIndia، در پی ارتقاء ارزش افزوده و طراحی بومی است. 3. ترکیه – توسعه صنعت پوشاک با تمرکز بر صادرات و برندهای بومی ترکیه در دو دهه گذشته با تمرکز بر صادرات به اروپا، برندهای موفقی مانند LC Waikiki، Koton و Mavi را در بازارهای بین‌المللی تثبیت کرده است. سیاست‌های ترکیه در دهه 1990 شامل آزادسازی کنترل دولتی، خصوصی‌سازی صنایع نساجی و تأسیس مناطق آزاد بود. استان‌هایی مانند دنیزلی، بورسا، و قاضی‌انتپ به مراکز تخصصی تولید پارچه و پوشاک بدل شدند. ترکیه همچنین زنجیره کامل از نخ‌ریسی تا طراحی مد و بازاریابی بین‌المللی را توسعه داد. تجربیات این کشور نشان می‌دهد که پیوند میان صنعت، صادرات، طراحی و برندینگ می‌تواند صنعت پوشاک را از خام‌فروشی به قدرت‌آفرینی اقتصادی برساند. 4. بنگلادش – ظهور به‌عنوان دومین صادرکننده پوشاک جهان با نیروی کار ارزان و سیاست تشویقی بنگلادش با صادرات بیش از 38 میلیارد دلار پوشاک در سال 2022، پس از چین دومین صادرکننده پوشاک دنیاست. نقطه قوت این کشور، نیروی کار بسیار ارزان و نظام مالیاتی و تجاری خاص مناطق ویژه صادراتی است. سیاست‌هایی چون معافیت مالیاتی، عدم وجود تعرفه بر واردات مواد اولیه، و حمایت از تأسیس کارخانه‌های کوچک و متوسط، باعث شده بیش از 4000 کارخانه پوشاک در بنگلادش فعال باشند. دولت بنگلادش با حمایت از آموزش زنان در مناطق روستایی و ایجاد زنجیره‌های خانوادگی تولید، از صنعت پوشاک به‌عنوان اهرمی برای توسعه فراگیر استفاده کرده است. 5. چین – ساخت زنجیره‌ کامل نساجی از پنبه‌کاری تا برندینگ جهانی چین از دهه 1980 با سیاست درهای باز، صنعت نساجی را به یکی از پیشران‌های صنعتی خود بدل ساخت. زنجیره تولید در چین، از کشت پنبه در ایالت‌های غربی، تا تولید ماشین‌آلات نساجی، دوخت، طراحی و فروش بین‌المللی گسترده است. مناطق ویژه اقتصادی مانند شنژن و شانگهای میزبان برندهای جهانی و کارخانه‌های بزرگ پوشاک شدند. علاوه بر تولید انبوه، چین با شرکت‌هایی مانند Bosideng یا Peacebird وارد حوزه طراحی و برندینگ جهانی نیز شد. دولت چین همچنین با انعقاد توافق‌های تجارت آزاد در جنوب شرق آسیا، صادرات نساجی را تسهیل کرده است. 6. ایتالیا – تقویت برندهای لوکس با تمرکز بر طراحی، کیفیت و مد پایدار ایتالیا به‌واسطه برندهایی چون Gucci، Prada، Armani و Dolce & Gabbana نماد طراحی فاخر در صنعت پوشاک است. این کشور زنجیره‌ای از کارگاه‌های خانوادگی، طراحان مستقل، دانشگاه‌های مد، و شرکت‌های بافندگی باکیفیت را در شمال ایتالیا – به‌ویژه در منطقه لمباردی – توسعه داده است. دولت با حمایت از صادرات برندهای لوکس، شرکت در نمایشگاه‌های جهانی، و استفاده از ابزار دیپلماسی فرهنگی، صنعت مد را به یک قدرت نرم بدل کرده است. تجربه ایتالیا نشان می‌دهد که تمرکز بر ارزش افزوده، طراحی و تولید محدود، برخلاف تولید انبوه، می‌تواند منجر به موقعیت ممتاز در بازار جهانی شود. 7. ویتنام – استفاده از توافقات تجارت آزاد برای توسعه صنعت پوشاک صادراتی ویتنام با بهره‌گیری از توافقنامه‌های تجارت آزاد با اتحادیه اروپا (EVFTA)، کره‌جنوبی، ژاپن و کشورهای ASEAN، تعرفه‌های صادراتی را کاهش داده و سرمایه‌گذاران خارجی را جذب کرده است. شهرهایی مانند هوشی‌مین و هانوی به مراکز تولید پوشاک برای برندهای بین‌المللی مانند H&M و Zara تبدیل شده‌اند. دولت با تأسیس پارک‌های صنعتی، حمایت از آموزش فنی در مدارس و معافیت مالیاتی برای سرمایه‌گذاری خارجی، رشد سریعی را در صنعت پوشاک رقم زده است....

526f67f3173ee2c07beda12ea74f5cb0,2025-07-06 07:36:00,en,WEB,"  The late Queen Elizabeth allegedly 'saw through' Meghan Markle, and claimed her romance with Harry had become a 'complete catastrophe', just weeks before her death in September 2021. Prince Harry and his wife have always been at pains to stress that they enjoyed a warm bond with the late Queen, despite a rift with the other senior royals that has only deepened over the years. However, this week the Sussexes up and down relationship with the late Queen was revealed by journalist and royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith on her Substack Royal Extras , after her conversations with Her Majesty's late cousin Lady Elizabeth Anson. Lady Eliza, as she was known to friends, told Ms Bedell Smith that Harry had been 'rude' to his grandmother for 10 minutes during a meeting about his wedding and Meghan refused to disclose details of her dress, leaving the monarch 'saddened'. Her comments echo claims made previously in the Spectator magazine, that relations between Meghan, Harry and his grandmother were rather more complicated than the Sussexes have made out.

Queen Elizabeth II and Meghan at an event in Cheshire in June 2018.

That is not to say that relations between the couple and the monarch were always on an amicable footing with things beginning to sour during the planning of the couple's wedding, according to Lady Liza Anson. Born in Windsor Castle, Lady Elizabeth, a great-niece of the Queen Mother and a goddaughter of King George VI, was a high-society party planner. The Queen's first cousin, who arranged the Queen's 80th birthday party, allegedly said just days before Meghan and Harry's wedding: 'We hope but don't quite think she is in love. We think she engineered it all.' Meghan was apparently 'full of charm' and appeared 'natural, intelligent, and thoughtful' after she became engaged to Harry in 2017. But as the wedding approached, Meghan allegedly became increasingly 'bossy' and Liza said the Queen was privately 'very worried'. Ms Bedell Smith wrote: 'When we spoke two weeks before the May 19 wedding, Liza had just heard from the Queen. “The Number One Lady—I call her Jemima—says the jury is out on whether she likes Meghan,” said Liza. “My Jemima is very worried.” In Liza's view, “Harry is besotted and weak about women. Liza apparently said: 'It's worrying that so many people are questioning whether Meghan is right for Harry. The problem, bless his heart, is that Harry is neither bright nor strong, and she is both'. The cracks apparently appeared in February 2018. Liza claimed Harry wrote to her and said that his grandmother was 'content' with the way the wedding plans were coming along. But Sally Bedell Smith wrote that Liza had said: 'When I spoke with the Queen, she said she is not at all content'. Ms Bedell Smith wrote: 'According to Liza, the Queen was dismayed that Harry had asked the Archbishop of Canterbury to perform the wedding service in St. George's Chapel without first requesting permission from the Dean of Windsor. “Harry seems to think the Queen can do what she wants, but she can't,” said Liza. “On the religious side, it is the Dean of Windsor's jurisdiction.” As a result, Liza said that “Harry has blown his relationship with his grandmother. She said she was really upset. I was shocked when the Queen told me this, how she was so saddened. I had no idea about the conversation, that he was rude to her for ten minutes. They had tea with her the day before yesterday. She was trying to find out about the wedding dress, and Meghan wouldn't tell her.” .' Liza at this point predicted that Meghan could 'turn into nothing but trouble', remarking that the Suits actress 'sees things in a different way'. Following these February rows, towards the end of April, Liza claimed that “the Queen and Harry have patched things up'. Harry apparently visited her alone to smooth things over and later wrote to with more wedding details. Sally Bedell Smith wrote: 'Liza also said that Meghan's father, Thomas Markle, was “frightened of coming to the wedding.” I asked her if Meghan was being bossy. “So I gather,” Liza replied, “Very much so.” ' My Jemima is very worried', Liza apparently added. Ingrid Seward, one of the most prominent and respected writers on the British Royal Family, also discussed the nuptials in her book, My Mother and I. The royal biographer wrote: 'The Queen never voiced her true opinions except to her close confidants, such as Lady Elizabeth Anson, or Liza as she was known to her friends. ' She told me that the Queen had made only one remark about Meghan and Harry's wedding and that was that Meghan's Givenchy wedding gown was ""too white"".' ' In the monarch's view, it was not appropriate for a divorcee getting remarried in church to look quite so flamboyantly virginal,' Seward added. Meghan had previously been married to Hollywood film producer Trevor Engelson between 2011 and 2014...."

Prince Harry and his wife have always been at pains to stress that they enjoyed a warm bond with the late Queen, despite a rift with the other senior royals that has only deepened over the years. However, this week the Sussexes up and down relationship with the late Queen was revealed by journalist and royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith on her Substack Royal Extras, after her conversations with Her Majesty's late cousin Lady Elizabeth Anson. Lady Eliza, as she was known to friends, told Ms Bedell Smith that Harry had been 'rude' to his grandmother for 10 minutes during a meeting about his wedding and Meghan refused to disclose details of her dress, leaving the monarch 'saddened'. Her comments echo claims made previously in the Spectator magazine, that relations between Meghan, Harry and his grandmother were rather more complicated than the Sussexes have made out.

6b00408111660e860f9040468a9b9e85,2025-07-06 19:45:00,en,WEB,"  J ust a month before her passing in September 2022, Queen Elizabeth II reportedly shared her true feelings about Prince Harry and Meghan Markle in a private conversation at Balmoral. New reports claim the late Queen called their relationship a ""complete catastrophe"" in what insiders say was an uncharacteristically blunt moment from the monarch. Meghan Markle spotted humbly serving the Royal Family in rare look at family life Despite public efforts by the Sussexes to portray a warm relationship with the late Queen , royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith has shed new light on behind-the-scenes tensions, revealing that Elizabeth ""saw through Meghan "" and expressed deep disappointment over how things had unfolded between Harry and his wife. Bedell Smith published the claims in her Royal Extras Substack, citing personal conversations with Lady Elizabeth Anson , the Queen's late cousin and confidante, also known to friends as Lady Liza . According to her, Queen Elizabeth appeared both regretful and saddened during a pre-dinner conversation at Balmoral, where she discussed Harry's marriage in unusually candid terms. ""It was out of character for the Queen ,"" a source told Bedell Smith. ""But she saw straight through Meghan ."" Queen's concern about Meghan's influence and Harry's judgment Lady Liza , a highly connected member of the royal family and a former party planner for the Queen's 80th birthday, confided that tensions had emerged as early as the couple's wedding planning in 2018. She said Harry had been ""rude"" to his grandmother during a 10-minute meeting and that Meghan had refused to share details about her dress with the Queen , leaving her upset. In a particularly pointed remark, Liza reportedly told Bedell Smith just two weeks before the wedding, ""We hope but don't quite think she is in love. We think she engineered it all."" The Queen , according to Liza , was ""very worried,"" particularly as Meghan's behavior shifted from being charming and thoughtful to increasingly controlling. Liza also claimed that Harry had bypassed royal protocol by requesting that the Archbishop of Canterbury conduct the wedding without first consulting the Dean of Windsor . The Queen was ""dismayed"" by this, she said. The Queen allegedly remarked that Meghan's Givenchy gown was ""too white"" for a second wedding, believing it inappropriate for a divorcée marrying in church. Liza's verdict on Harry was no less severe: ""He is neither bright nor strong, and she is both."" She predicted trouble ahead for the marriage and described Meghan as someone who ""sees things in a different way."" Lilibet name dispute and Megxit's collapse Tensions only escalated after the wedding. The Queen reportedly reacted with dismay when the Sussexes named their daughter Lilibet , a personal childhood nickname used only by close family. ""I don't own the palaces, I don't own the paintings, the only thing I own is my name. And now they've taken that,"" the Queen is said to have told an aide. Though Harry and Meghan insisted they had received the Queen's blessing, insiders dispute this, and Robert Hardman , in his biography of King Charles , claimed that the Queen was ""as angry as I'd ever seen her"" following the announcement. The Queen's initial hope for a compromise arrangement during the Sussexes' royal departure - known as ""Megxit"" - also fell apart. Author Valentine Low wrote that Meghan's desire to earn money independently clashed with palace expectations for working royals. In the Queen's view, if they could not abide by the restrictions on commercial activity, they could not continue representing the Crown in any capacity. In the final years of her reign, Queen Elizabeth II remained committed to the monarchy's image, even at the cost of personal relationships. While her public messages maintained a tone of affection - stating that "" Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family"" before Lilibet was born - the private remarks emerging now suggest a more complicated and painful story behind closed doors."

mov_B58F2493E0835F8513A519F3C794AE3D,2025-07-07 11:01:04,en,WEB,"  This blurring powder is basically pure witchcraft and your *best* weapon against heat and humidity. And no, it's not the $59 Givenchy version. 1. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder, which is SO GOOD at eliminating shine and blurring pores that I feel like it'd smirk at you and go, ""How 'bout that, huh? "" if it had a human form. If you dread summer because you love wearing makeup but the heat and humidity leave it looking patchy, this'll lock it in with a smooth, semi-matte finish. Your oily T-zone doesn't know what's coming for it. One reviewer compares this to a $59 Givenchy powder! Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""This is the secret for makeup in hot and humid climates! I am a sweaty person, but I also love wearing makeup regardless of the weather. While holidaying in Southeast Asia at the start of wet season, I faced temperatures between 35 and 40 degrees Celsius (95–104 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity. After finishing my base makeup, I applied this powder all over. I did not use a setting spray because most break me out. Luckily, no setting spray was necessary while using this setting powder! It kept my foundation and cream blush from separating or becoming patchy, and also kept me from being too shiny. I reapplied a couple of times per day. This is magical and I will definitely be using regularly during the summers in North America too!"" —Sara Lima Get it from Amazon for $25. 2. A smocked midi dress because Hill House's Nap Dress is truly ~dreamy~ but your bank account is like, ""Um, we still need to buy groceries."" This cutie's a fraction of the cost and just as gorgeous, not to mention breathable as heck thanks to its 100% organic cotton poplin fabric. Prepare to fall head over heels for this dress — I definitely did. I recently wore this dress (in shade Lipstick Pink) to an outdoor wedding and I. AM. OBSESSED. It hugs my frame beautifully with the stretchy smocked waist — I can even get away with not wearing a bra, though for context I'm a B cup — and the flowy bottom of the dress sits just right. I personally haven't tried Hill House's Nap Dress (I drool over the designs, but $178 is a little too steep for me), but I'm perfectly happy to stock up on this dress in a few colors for around the same price. My colleague Heather Braga, on the other hand, is a Hill House devotee — but even she was impressed by this cheaper option: ""Listen, I am the proud owner of NINE Hill House Nap Dresses. I condone splurging on them (truly, by all means) and will be the first to tell you they are worth every penny. That being said, I tried out one of these from Quince and LOVE it. I have the Tribeca Stripe pattern and cannot believe how similar it feels to the other brand. It's my current go-to style for my frame (two kids in two years, send prayers) and is one of the few things I know I can throw on and KNOW I look great. Will definitely add another to an upcoming order and have been shouting from the rooftops how wonderful this brand fits."" Get it from Quince for $69.90 (available in sizes XS–XL and nine styles). 3. E.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen if you're still trying to find a daily sunscreen you don't despise. This clear gel sunscreen offers SPF 35 and goes on so smooth and lightweight, you'll immediately forget you're wearing it — no white cast here, folks. It doubles as a blurring primer, so it's great for wearing under makeup too! If you love Supergoop but the price is becoming hard to swallow...may I suggest trying this, because it's *very* similar. The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop's cult-fave product end. I've tried both, and I honestly prefer this E.l.f. version. Supergoop's had a slight graininess to it that I didn't love, while this E.l.f. sunscreen is exactly what I'd hoped Supergoop's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top!..."

The actress fronts the magazine's August 2025 issue in a new editorial exclusively styled by Tabitha Simmons, wearing nine looks from Sarah Burton's debut Givenchy Fall 2025 collection. For her shoot by Annie Leibovitz, Hathaway takes Burton's celebrated creations on a journey through New York City, including Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. While speaking with Maya Singer for her feature interview, Hathaway also chats about her new film Mother Mary, feeling like a “beginner” in her role as its titular pop star in crisis, and her new chapter of wide-ranging projects in the 2020's (which will also include new Princess Diaries and Devil Wears Prada sequels!) . “What struck me right away, reading the script, is that you can't 'perform' Mother Mary,” said Hathaway. “If I got the part, I would have to become material David could craft with. I had to submit to being a beginner. The humility of that—showing up every day knowing you're going to suck. And it has to be okay. You're not 'bad.' You're just a beginner. Getting to that mindset—I had to shed some things that were hard to shed. It was welcome. But it was hard, the way transformational experiences can be hard.” All images: Annie Leibovitz JW Anderson Steps Back From Runways—And Steps Into Home Design Jonathan Anderson's namesake JW Anderson brand is taking a break from the runway, According to Dazed, the beloved designer's eclectic label is stopping its seasonal runway shows and largely stepping back from releasing large fashion collections. Instead, the brand will focusing on creating accessories, staple fashion pieces, and luxury home goods—as well as expanding its retail footprint with new stores in New York, Paris, Belgravia, and Pimlico. Anderson's new Resort 2026 collection is the first to introduce the concept, featuring a thinner J.W. Anderson logo across the designer's signature whimsical knits and denim. His ready-to-wear pieces are paired with a range of his favorite curated objects, including re-editions of Charles Rennie Mackintosh's oak lamps and stools, curated books, vintage gardening tools, Lucie Rie mugs, Murano glassware, Jason Mosseri's Hope Spring chairs, Akiko Hirai's ceramics, Welsh blankets, hand-forged nails, Houghton Hall Estate honey, and Postcard Teas' coffee-flavored tea.

1lty23e,2025-07-07 16:03:21,en,REDDIT,"  Hey frag fam, 24M from Delhi here. I've been into fragrances for a while now, but most of what I know today is thanks to this amazing community. Whether it was going down rabbit holes on old threads or reading all the reviews and recommendations, I've learned so much — and I genuinely want to thank all the fellow fragheads here for helping me become a more cognoscenti person in this world of scent. I started out with just 2–3 designer bottles, and looking back now, I'm genuinely proud of how far I've come. From blindly wearing basic stuff to now appreciating note breakdowns, flankers, seasonal wear — it's been a fun and nerdy ride I used ChatGPT to help organize this post, but all opinions are mine. Here's my current designer starter pack – 15 fragrances, quick thoughts, and ratings: 1. YSL Y EDP – My all-time favourite. Clean, fresh, sweet, gets compliments without even trying. 10/10 2. 1 Million Lucky – Hazelnut and plum combo that's just addictive. Discontinued and that hurts. 9/10 3. Acqua Di Giò Profumo – Classy AF. Smells like a CEO went for a walk by the sea. 9/10 4. YSL MYSLF – At first I was like meh… but it grew on me. Fresh, musky, different. 8.5/10 5. Dior Homme Sport 2021 – Ginger kick with a clean drydown. Very easy to wear. 8.5/10 6. Armani Code Parfum – Softer, modern version of the OG. Perfect for close settings. 8.5/10 7. Acqua Di Giò Parfum (2024) – The newest one, and honestly pretty good. Fresh with depth. 8/10 8. 1 Million EDT – Loud, sweet, and still works when I want to stand out. Club or winter frag. 8/10 9. Terre d'Hermès EDT – Smells like grown-man confidence. Dirty orange + vetiver vibe. 8/10 10. Versace Dylan Blue – My safe pick when I don't know what to wear. Just works. 8/10 11.

可以是实证方面的，或者例如实体对齐、KBQA、知识表示学习等任务中的 idea。 【写在前面】在上篇里提到了Daydream如何正面硬刚和的Agentic Shopping，怀抱同样雄心的另一支创业团队Gensmo也在6月底正式发布了其2.0版本。 这个将自己定位为世界第一个AI Fashion Agent的平台，在美通社发稿宣传已筹集超过6000万美元的种子资金，自去年12月上线测试版App以来，帮助用户生成了超过1000万种风格匹配，并索引了1亿件时尚产品，在TikTok和Instagram上，每天UGC穿搭分享量达数千次，一些视频的观看次数超过百万。 创始人胡宁拥有卡内基梅隆大学人工智能博士学位，曾担任谷歌移动搜索技术主管和阿里巴巴副总裁。 采访中她强调：“时尚的未来并非人工智能取代个人风格，而是利用科技让用户能够自信地表达自我，这种平衡是Gensmo的核心。” 是的，部分场景下的AI产品在设计之初就应该秉承增强人类的理念，而不是取代；也正如我在之前博客文章里反复谈到的观点，时尚购物路程本身对很多人来说也是乐趣，应该节制AI的侵入感，保留更多的权力还给用户。 更何况在现实的技术意义上，该领域的知识图谱至今与人类理解尚未完全拉齐。 麦肯锡《The state of fashion 2024》报告预计，未来3至5年内，生成式AI可为时尚及奢侈品行业增加1500至2750亿美元的经营利润。 很多传统时尚企业在上一个信息化时代，数字基础设施不够完善，其中就包括企业知识图谱的构建，使得AI的应用基本依赖第三方的标准化技术服务，在电商内容生成和产品辅助设计流程中浅尝即止。 对于有些数字化程度较高的头部企业，也因为背负品牌形象的价值负担，谨慎避开了让AI与消费者直接交互的风险，将仍存在“幻觉”的AI应用于中后台。 比如LVMH正在利用Agent快速无缝地建立VIC客户档案，并向SA（销售助理 ）提供建议。 AI基于「客户偏好-产品信息-时尚共识」知识图谱的数据整合，可以预测客户喜欢哪些其他商品，哪些与之前的购买可以搭配，甚至是之前因为时间或勇气不足而不敢尝试的类型，那些SA不会推荐的产品——他们可能担心无效，导致客户的不信任或失望。 然而像Gensmo这样的新创公司没有这样的顾虑，将时尚搭配、搜索、虚拟试穿和沉浸式个性化氛围无缝集成到一个AI赋能的用户体验中。 鼓励用户上传已经和希望拥有的衣服、或从社交媒体或时尚出版物中汲取的任意风格灵感照片，又或者仅仅简单地用自然语言描述他们的具体需求。 然后智能引擎直接将这些输入快速转化为实用的建议，、甚至合适的发型和化妆技巧，并结合，让用户可以毫不费力地想象推荐的服装在自己身上的实际外观，加速「灵感—购物车—下单」旅程的转化。 实现这些愿景的根基是对时尚的深刻理解，当前的人工智能技术非常擅长结构化理性任务，但时尚和美——受文化、情感和个人经历的影响——本质上是主观的。 因此创新的指导性问题就是：“人工智能能否学习品味并理解美？” 要让专用的AI模型不断进化，从人类的经验中学习，就离不开时尚图谱。 欢迎订阅我的笔记：

共同的前言 
（读过Graph-1 & 2 的朋友可以直接跳到Part-3. 规则逻辑部分） 
在通用模型基座已经达到落地可用标准的当下，「领域知识」成为阻扰时尚行业AI Mass Adoption的瓶颈之一。 Google的Agentic智能购物采用了Shopping Graph，构建了产品-卖家-品牌-评论之间的语义网络，但这种围绕「产品知识」的图谱，无法捕捉超越客观属性的细致美学、文化和主观意义。 另外，在众多杰出的生图模型中，也因为对时尚风格的理解局限，导致生成的换装可控性总有遗憾。 我想时尚领域知识应该还需要另一图谱用于构建视觉元素的语义网络：「时尚图谱」Styling Graph。 无论是GPT-4V还是Gemini 2.5 Pro在通用视觉理解上也只有70分，更谈不上精准的时尚生成（包括自然语言问答、生图生视频）。 对此，我将分三篇系列文章从跨学科（社会学、语言学、符号学、知识管理、时尚心理等）角度，首先抛砖引玉，在理论层面尝试提出可能改进时尚视觉语言模型（FVLM）的三角研究框架：【视觉特征←→文本术语←→规则逻辑】。 下一步的工作是将这些抽象思想转化为具体的计算模型、数据结构和算法，构建一个具有明确评估方法论的稳健实验设计。 最终的目标是让三角框架能用于构建视觉语言训练（VLP）的数据库，结合检索增强生成技术（ RAG），为视觉语言模型（VLM）扩展能力边界，缓解模型的知识固化、长尾知识缺失与幻觉问题，使用知识图谱支撑大模型的可解释性。 考虑到Agentic端到端流程场景，将其装配到两个“大脑”，供给端的专家Agent，以及用户消费端的决策Agent。 每个Agent有——一个知识图谱后端确保答案正确且符合上下文，一个LLM 前端确保交互自然。 从更广阔的角度看，如果能够成功解决这些挑战，该方法将为其他需要主观解释、文化语境和隐性人类理解的领域（如艺术、设计、烹饪等）提供一个构建“文化智能”人工智能系统的蓝图。 为泛化多模态知识图谱提供一个强大的范式，弥合人工智能研究中长期存在的鸿沟。 2024年1月巴黎高级定制时装周夏帕瑞丽（Schiaparelli）让模特怀抱机器人婴儿 
Part-3. 规则逻辑 
System of Fashion 
“规则逻辑”是人类时尚知识的总结，包括习俗化的符号象征、公认的趣味标准等，往往隐含于经验之中，需要显式提取并编码到知识库。 在“图像特征 ←→ 文本术语 ←→ 规则逻辑”三角结构中，扮演约束和推理依据的角色。 这些规则涵盖色彩搭配的协调技巧、图案组合的宜忌、不同场合的着装礼仪、以及依据体型选择服饰的指南等等。 它是知识关联桥梁，连接图像提取的视觉特征和文本语义标签。 例如，当视觉分析识别出服装款式或颜色时，规则可以决定这些视觉元素在特定情境下的可接受性或搭配优劣，从而将感知层信息提升到知识层进行推理。 通过让模型生成并筛选自身的高质量多跳推理路径，提升对主观语义的解释能力 
把模糊的时尚知识转化为无数的三元组 <主 (Subject), 谓 (Predicate), 宾 (Object)> ，抽象为机器可读格式的无数“神经元”，从而构建结构化的语义神经网络形成知识图谱，形成知识库骨架。 将图像、感知和经验纳入，并在此类多模态上进行表征学习，这些规则节点/关系可以与服饰实体和属性术语相连，形成推理规则集。 有研究表明LLM中的长思维链（CoT）同样能有效提升VLM的性能。 将文本CoT数据迁移到多模态场景，微调的效果接近多模态蒸馏，也许能处理时尚图像中复杂的文化符号。 例如解决“何以成为Halo Element”时，模型需先定位设计元素，再分析颜色、纹理、廓形等文化关联，在意义层借助强化学习与时间戳向量实现可辩论的符号演化追踪，最后综合生成结论。 仅靠数据驱动的模型难以掌握丰富的常识和逻辑规则，更不必说那种最受顶尖玩家们追捧的时尚法则竟然是“犯错”——它是一种耐人寻味、有意为之、深思熟虑的刻意疏忽，无论是意大利人口中的Sprezzatura，还是代表巴黎女性的Effortless，还是现在我们家常挂在嘴边的「松弛感」。 也许利用Transformer技术路线天然的幻觉“劣势”，反而更容易突变出这种“高级感”。 2024年2月赞达亚 (

搭建领域知识规则的两种技术路径，也代表了AI进化史上模仿人类的两种选择： 
   隐式规则学习 – 数据驱动
当前学术研究多采用数据驱动的方法，从大规模服饰搭配数据中学习搭配模式，捕捉服饰之间更复杂的规则与关联（如多维度兼容性、季节与材质适配等）。 典型做法是利用度量学习或图神经网络，将服饰组成Outfit的兼容性用向量空间（Vector Space）表示出来。 这类方法能够从非结构化的流行趋势和用户行为中总结出“隐性规则”（如哪些单品常一起出现），但瓶颈在于：模型缺乏对显性时尚规则的了解，可能学到的数据模式难以解释，而且需要大量搭配数据支持。 当碰到新颖搭配或违反常规的组合时，模型难以判断好坏，因为缺少先验的规则知识。 典型例子是Polyvore时尚Outfit数据集，其中包含约6.8万套由时尚爱好者搭配的服饰集合，每套搭配都精心挑选确保风格统一。 这类数据提供了隐式的上下文：哪些单品经常一起出现、某件上衣通常配何种风格下装等。..."

mov_DDF6C3A5A1E054BF57D8010BE6885036,2025-07-08 05:00:49,en,WEB,"  Fiorucci Spring Summer 2026 backstage moments captured by Sohom Das for DSCENE   With a career spanning some of the most iconic names in Italian fashion, Versace, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Givenchy, and Ferragamo, Francesca Murri has quietly shaped the visual language of contemporary luxury. In 2023, she took the creative helm at Fiorucci, the legendary Italian label founded in 1967 by Elio Fiorucci. Tasked with revitalizing a brand known for its irreverence and pop spirit, Murri has already presented four collections that pulse with energy, color, and optimism. Murri's approach to Fiorucci is equal parts reverence and reinvention. Drawing deeply from the house's rich archive, she reinterprets its iconic motifs—lips, angels, hearts, through a modern, playful lens. Her debut collection, unveiled at Milan Fashion Week in September 2023, set the tone for her tenure: a vibrant celebration of joy, freedom, and creativity, all rooted in Fiorucci's signature DNA. The upcoming “ Beatittudo ” FW25 collection continued this narrative, inspired by the pursuit of pure happiness and characterized by a bold palette that injects fresh energy into the brand. Under Francesca Murri, Fiorucci has become a platform for experimentation and dialogue, embracing collaborations with artists and emerging talents from across the creative spectrum. Her vision is about more than clothes; it's about fostering a community and spreading positive messages that resonate in today's world. By blending the brand's storied past with the needs and languages of modern society, Murri is ensuring Fiorucci's legacy remains as dynamic and relevant as ever. Below, Francesca Murri discusses with DSCENE's EIC Zarko Davinic her creative process, the role of Milan, the power of contrasts, and her hopes for Fiorucci's future post her Spring Summer 2026 runway show in Milan . Photo ©Sohom Das   What does it mean for you and Fiorucci to present your collections in Milano every season? How does the city's unique energy influence your creative process? – Milano is where Elio Fiorucci created everything and started dreaming. It's crucial for me to catch the spirit of the city and put it into a very international narrative. Influences come from everywhere in this place full of art. Piazza Fiorucci is described as a space where everyday reality and fantasy meet. How did you translate this concept into both the collection and the show's outdoor set design? – For the collection I asked Janina Zais to work body painting and hair spraying the models to inject the cartoonish approach into the products. I also take inspiration, for the red pois dress, from the Walt Disney character Minnie. For the set design I wanted to use banners that represented the sky and road signs on the ground with totally invented and fantastic elements such as the angel shooting the arrow. The collection is full of contrasts, urban yet dreamlike, tender yet sensual. How do you approach balancing these opposing elements in your designs? – I play very much with contrasts that are very crucial for the brand. When there's something basic I apply something unexpected in a very Fiorucci way. And also the contrast played through the association between products and faces is very important. Rock characters with chic products and the opposites work very well. Many pieces play with iconic Fiorucci motifs, like the lips, angels, and hearts, reimagined in playful, pop-art ways. What draws you to these symbols, and how do you keep them feeling fresh? – I always start by defining the key pillars of the brand and based on the seasonal concept I focus on the ones that help me to push forward the concept. This season the pop, cartoonish approach influenced my way to characterize them. The slogan “Make Hearts Beat Again” featured on accessories and tees is both affectionate and provocative. What message are you hoping to send with this phrase? – In these uncertain moments in which everyone is a bit scared, I wanted send out a positive message by inviting people to make hearts beat again. An ode to love! Photo ©Sohom Das   The collection uses a bold color palette and a mix of classic and innovative materials, from recycled PVC to Tyvek and glossy coatings. How do you decide which materials best express a new Fiorucci era? – We usually search for innovative materials and this is very important to express the feelings I am having at the beginning of the creative process. The unexpected approach to the usage of the materials can create uniqueness. In a time when the fashion industry faces economic challenges and a looming recession, what do you believe will help brands like Fiorucci stay resilient and relevant? – It's hard for the new projects to find a place in this tough and crowded market. I believe that Fiorucci can have a role in society by creating a platform for collaborations with emerging talents to generate very creative contents not only in fashion but also in art and music. Looking ahead, how do you see Fiorucci's identity evolving? What are your hopes for the brand, and for the industry? – I see the project more mature season after season. I hope the market will get better soon to have more opportunities to reach our targeted clients throughout pop ups and stores and give them more chances to experience the brand.

Hoy en día, el magnetismo personal, la actitud, la trayectoria profesional e incluso el estilo de vida influyen en la percepción pública. En un momento donde las redes sociales, las plataformas de streaming y los grandes eventos marcan la pauta, algunos nombres destacan no solo por su talento, sino por ese halo irresistible que los convierte en auténticos iconos de seducción. A continuación, presentamos un ranking de los famosos más atractivos del momento, tanto dentro como fuera de España, que dominan titulares, alfombras rojas y corazones por igual. Para realizar este artículo hemos utilizado la ayuda del ChatGPT, una herramienta que funciona con inteligencia artificial. 1-Manu Ríos Desde que se hizo mundialmente conocido por su papel en Élite, Manu Ríos no ha dejado de escalar en el mundo de la moda, el entretenimiento y las redes sociales. Su elegancia natural y su estilo andrógino lo han llevado a protagonizar campañas para firmas como Balmain, Givenchy o Dior, consolidándose como un referente estético para las nuevas generaciones. 2-Ester Expósito Pocas actrices españolas han causado tanto impacto mediático en tan poco tiempo como Ester Expósito. Su papel en Élite fue solo el inicio de una carrera que no ha dejado de evolucionar, y su presencia en alfombras rojas internacionales la ha convertido en una auténtica embajadora del glamour. Más allá de sus rasgos delicados y su porte elegante, Ester desprende seguridad, intensidad y una energía arrolladora que la ha colocado entre las mujeres más deseadas del mundo. En redes sociales supera los 30 millones de seguidores, una cifra que habla de su impacto más allá de la pantalla. 3-Michele Morrone El actor y cantante italiano Michele Morrone alcanzó fama mundial gracias a su papel en la trilogía erótica 365 DNI, pero desde entonces ha demostrado que su talento va mucho más allá de la estética. Su físico imponente, su mirada penetrante y su voz grave lo han convertido en un icono de sensualidad, pero también en un artista completo. 4-Ana de Armas Cuba y España se dan la mano en la figura de Ana de Armas, una actriz que ha conquistado Hollywood con su belleza hipnótica y su talento frente a las cámaras. Desde Knives Out hasta Blonde, pasando por la saga de James Bond, ha dejado claro que su presencia no es casualidad. Ana combina un rostro de belleza singular con una carrera cuidadosamente trazada, y eso la convierte en una de las actrices más codiciadas del momento. 5-Mario Casas Mario Casas ha sido, durante más de una década, uno de los actores más deseados del panorama español y en 2025 su popularidad sigue intacta. Con una imagen más madura y una carrera consolidada, el intérprete ha sabido reinventarse, alejándose del estereotipo adolescente que lo lanzó a la fama en Tres metros sobre el cielo. Su cuerpo trabajado, su voz rasgada y su actitud desenfadada siguen generando suspiros, pero también lo ha hecho su evolución profesional. Mario se ha ganado el respeto del sector con papeles complejos y arriesgados, lo que ha reforzado su atractivo como hombre completo: seductor, comprometido y cercano. 6-Zendaya No hay alfombra roja, portada de revista ni desfile donde Zendaya pase desapercibida. La actriz y cantante estadounidense ha redefinido lo que significa ser atractiva en la era actual: segura de sí misma, multifacética y con un estilo que oscila entre lo urbano y lo vanguardista. 7-Álex González Con más de dos décadas de carrera a sus espaldas, Álex González sigue siendo uno de los hombres más atractivos del panorama nacional. Su participación en series como El Príncipe o Toy Boy lo han mantenido en el foco, y su físico imponente, combinado con una mirada intensa, le otorgan un aura de galán clásico. Fuera de la pantalla, Álex ha sabido mantener un perfil bajo, lo que le ha conferido cierto aire de misterio. Sus apariciones públicas son siempre medidas, pero cuando lo hace, acapara todas las miradas. El equilibrio entre lo reservado y lo apasionado lo coloca en esta lista sin discusión. 8-Timothée Chalamet Delicado, creativo, enigmático. Timothée Chalamet no responde a los cánones tradicionales de belleza masculina, y tal vez por eso genera tanta fascinación. El actor franco-estadounidense ha conquistado tanto a la crítica como al público joven gracias a su sensibilidad, su versatilidad interpretativa y su capacidad de expresar emoción con una sola mirada. 9-Blanca Suárez Pocas actrices nacionales combinan belleza, elegancia y carisma como Blanca Suárez. Su carrera se ha movido entre la televisión, el cine y la moda, pero ha sido su personalidad —desenfadada, directa, sin artificios— la que la ha convertido en un referente de atractivo natural. 10-Henry Cavill Aunque su fama se consolidó como Superman, Henry Cavill ha demostrado ser mucho más que un rostro esculpido. Su porte británico, su voz grave y su presencia imponente lo convierten en un ícono de masculinidad clásica, pero con una dimensión moderna que lo hace irresistible."

I, Tarun Kumar Oberoi, am the registered owner of Hyundai Creta (Reg No: UK17P9825, Black), which was stolen in less than 60 seconds on the night of 25th June 2025 from outside B-40, opposite HDFC Bank, Amar Colony, Lajpat Nagar 4, New Delhi. Despite filing an FIR (No. 017573, dated 26/06/2025 at Amar Colony Police Station) and informing my insurance company, not a single person from Hyundai has contacted me. This silence and inaction from your side is deeply disappointing.

The flowing silk creponne gathered evening gown featured a cape back detailing. The Princess paired it with an evening clutch embroidered with a lily of the valley motif as well as the Lover's Knot Tiara. The diadem, made by the House of Garrard in 1913, consists of diamonds and a collection of 19 hanging pearls set in silver and gold. The Lover's Knot was also a favorite of the late Princess Diana. The Princess of Wales's choice of Sarah Burton for Givenchy is a clear statement of fashion diplomacy: a design by a British woman for a French fashion house, it serves as a sartorial symbol of the symbiotic relationship between the two European countries. It is also a moment that will excite followers of the fashion industry. Dressing the Princess for the state banquet is one of the highest-profile moments thus far for Burton during her tenure as Givenchy's creative director. Her appointment was announced in September 2024 and her debut collection was shown in March 2025. Previously, Elle Fanning wore one of her designs to the Oscars, as did Cynthia Erivo to the 2025 Tony Awards. It also further cements Middleton's role as a perennial muse for Burton. The designer was the creative mastermind behind the royal's now iconic ivory lace wedding dress, which she wore to marry Prince William at Westminster Abbey in 2011. She also designed three separate looks for the Princess's ethereal birthday portraits. Like Queen Elizabeth's longstanding relationship with British fashion designer Norman Hartnell, it seems that Sarah Burton and the Princess of Wales will continue to etch their fashion story together."

Christian Dior himself considered it his lucky bloom, frequently incorporating it into his designs. Completing the look were a series of high honors and sashes — visual reminders of Kate's evolving senior role in the royal family.

Den dreitägige Besuch des französischen Präsidentenpaares Emmanuel (47) und Brigitte Macron (72) hat sie für einen regelrecht showstehlenden Wow-Auftritt genutzt. Für den feierlichen Abend auf Schloss Windsor wählte sie ein tiefrotes Kleid, das laut diversen Medien von Sarah Burton (51) von Givenchy entworfen wurde. Mit der Designerin hat Kate eine besondere modische Verbindung: Als sie noch Kreativdirektorin von Alexander McQueen war, hatte Burton das Hochzeitskleid entworfen, in dem die Prinzessin 2011 an der Seite von Prinz William (43) vor den Traualtar schritt. Zu dem dunkelroten Seidenkleid trug sie eine mit Maiglöckchen bestickte Abendtasche, prunkvolle Ohrringe und ihre geliebte ""Lover's Knot""-Tiara, die zuvor schon von Königin Mary, Queen Mum, Queen Elizabeth II. und Prinzessin Diana getragen wurde. Auch auf Instagram teilte das royale Paar ein gemeinsames Bild. ""Bereit für das, was heute Abend in Windsor ein wunderbares Staatsbankett verspricht"", lautet die Bildunterschrift. Im edlen schwarzen Frack mitsamt einer auffälligen weißen Fliege und diversen Orden an der Brust hat sich auch Prinz William gebührend in Schale geworfen. Staatsbesuch bis 10. Juli Schon im Mai dieses Jahres hatte der britische Palast angekündigt, dass König Charles III. (76) die Macrons zu einem Staatsbesuch eingeladen hat, der vom 8. Juli bis 10. Juli stattfinden soll. Es ist der erste französische Staatsbesuch seit rund 17 Jahren. Im März 2008 war der damalige Präsident Nicolas Sarkozy (70) einer Einladung der mittlerweile verstorbenen Queen Elizabeth II. (1926-2022) gefolgt. Der britische König und die Königin waren derweil zuletzt im September 2023 auf Staatsbesuch in Frankreich."

One of the most acclaimed and incendiary designers of his generation, McQueen took his life in 2010 at the age of 40 in London. Daring and original with his designs and runway shows, the British-born talent burst on the scene in the 1990s. The son of a taxi driver and self-described “big mouth East English yob,” McQueen rose to the top of the fashion world. With his 1995 controversial Highland Rape collection that used remnants from fabric shops, McQueen caught the attention of European luxury titans. In 1996, Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, tapped the then-27-year-old to be the creative lead at Givenchy, a post he held for five years. In 2000, the Gucci Group bought a 51 percent stake in McQueen's company, allowing for expansion via signature boutiques; a secondary line called McQ licensed to Italy's SINV; menswear and leather goods, and collaborations with brands including Puma and Samsonite. Despite such reach and a Target collaboration in 2009, his namesake company did not have the financial might of his rivals, during his lifetime. A decade in the making, “House of McQueen” starts previews next month and the grand opening will be held Sept. 9 at the Mansion at Hudson Yards. In a joint interview Tuesday with show producer Rick Lazes and Gary McQueen, a nephew of the designer, Lazes said, “What would Lee do?” was their mantra, whenever they felt tripped up. (The designer was known as Lee to family and close friends.) The theater — the first new one to be built in Manhattan in more than 20 years — was financed and designed by their company Alexander McQueen LLC. McQueen said, “There are obviously a lot of complexities in Lee's life, both personally and his rise into the elites of fashion from his humble beginnings. That is really a true underdog story, and a very inspiring one. Hopefully, what we've achieved with this inspires the younger generation who don't really know Alexander McQueen the person, but also satisfies long-term fans of my uncle's work. It does touch some personal stuff.” Lazes said, “No matter what obstacles he encountered, he overcame them and his art continued to flourish, Despite adversity and the mercantile pressure of the fashion industry, his genius shone through. We're hoping people will leave the theater feeling like they've seen genius. For those who don't know McQueen, it will be like seeing Picasso for the first time. He [McQueen] was never accepted as a great artist, which he clearly was. He was always relegated as a fashion designer. We're hoping people will see that he influenced not only the fashion world, but music, art and pop culture. And he still does today.” Meant to be a well-rounded and entertaining representation of the designer's life, the 90-minute seated performance will feature “Bridgerton” actor Luke Newton in the lead role. Family members and other key figures in McQueen's life like Isabella Blow will also be portrayed. Ticket holders will also have access to a concurrent exhibition of original McQueen gowns that will be adjacent to the theater. With more than 1,000 square feet of LED screens, the show will feature creative content that was developed with Gary McQueen's oversight about Lee's motivation, thoughts and drive for creative genius to play up his art, work and spirit. Needless to say McQueen-designed pieces will not be worn by the actors. To write the play, Darrah Cloud drew from previous media interviews with the designer and from conversations with his nephew, who is an artist. After Gary McQueen lost his father unexpectedly, Lee McQueen stepped in to babysit him as an older brother might. Years later, they worked together. He said, “There's a certain spirit attached to being a McQueen. I share a similar aesthetic that is both inspired by Lee, but that is also quite inherent to myself,” his nephew said. What I've learned from Lee is what fashion could be. It went way beyond clothes and fashion. It was about storytelling and artistry.” Looking forward to sharing McQueen's mannerisms and gestures with Newton, Gary McQueen said, “Lee almost had two sides to himself, where he had a split personality. He was a very down-to-earth person, and at other times, he was Alexander McQueen, who ruled his kingdom in the fashion world. He kind of separated himself from family and to who he was professionally.” Showgoers may be surprised by how McQueen managed “to break down barriers and the snobbery that was attached to fashion houses at that time,” his nephew said. Coming of age in the 1990s, when many edgy designers and artists were making waves in various industries, that trajectory is “very relatable to how the world is quite a hard place today.” Gary McQueen's aim is to continue his uncle's legacy through his art. Wishful that they had had more time together, he said, “Lee could have achieved so much more. He never ran out of creative ideas. The only thing that took the joy away from what he did was the pressures of coming up with so many collections. As an artist, that really gets in the way of being creative. I feel that the pressure got to be too much for him.” Innovative with technology, the designer crafted a hologram of Kate Moss for his fall 2006 runway show. Speculating how technical advances like 3D printing and other ones used by Iris Van Herpen would have appealed to McQueen, his nephew said, “There was a lot more that he could have achieved...."

As Kate joined King Charles, Queen Camilla, and Prince William at Windsor Castle to welcome French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte, her royal ensemble was all about class and diplomacy. The evening marked the start of the French state visit, and of course, all eyes were on Kate as she strutted down the grand banquet hall. Ditching her usual upcycled midi dresses for a deep burgundy gown that flowed effortlessly with every step, Kate looked every inch the stylish modern royal that she is. And the best part? Her exquisite gown was designed by none other than her longtime favourite, Sarah Burton. Kate Middleton opts for Givenchy for State Banquet For the unversed, Sarah Burton currently serves as the creative director at Givenchy, making Kate's ensemble a very pointed choice. A British designer crafting a gown in collaboration with a French fashion house? Sounds like diplomacy to us. But, apart from the hidden meaning behind her choice, the gown was quite a gorgeous masterpiece too.The silk creponne dress featured a dramatic cape-style back and a perfectly tailored waist that flared into a soft pleated skirt. It was glamorous without being too over the top, a look that Kate is best known for. And, as if the look wasn't striking enough on it's own, her accessories told a rich story too. Perched atop her head was the Lover's Knot tiara, a piece that once belonged to Princess Diana and was originally made for Queen Mary back in 1913. It is also one of Kate's most treasured and worn pieces, although this seems to be her first major tiara moment since 2023. For more sparkle, the Princess of Wales put on the diamond chandelier earrings from the late Queen Elizabeth's collection, while a dainty clutch embroidered with lily of the valley flowers expertly complimented the look. If you haven't guessed by now, when it comes to nostalgic nods and symbolic messages through fashion, no one does it quite like Kate!"

(Jemal Countess/WireImage for Saks Fifth Ave – NY) An off-Broadway play celebrating the life and career of gay fashion designer Alexander McQueen, titled House of McQueen, is in the works, and a Bridgerton star is set to portray the late icon. On Tuesday (8 July), Deadline reported that none other than actor Luke Newton will be stepping into McQueen's metaphorical dress shoes in the production, House of McQueen. The out gay fashion designer died in 2010 at the age of 40. Newton is best known for his role as Colin Bridgerton in the Netflix series, who was the star couple in season three, alongside Nicola Coughlan's Penelope Featherington. Luke Newton is set to portray the late gay fashion star. (Jed Cullen/Dave Benett/ for British Vogue) The official synopsis for the play reads: “House of McQueen is a new Off-Broadway play about the life and work of iconic fashion designer Alexander McQueen as told from his own revolutionary, daring and elegant perspective. It is the story of a boy born in the East End of London, who literally wears his heart on his sleeve, never meant to rise beyond his working-class family. “From making doll clothes for his mother's friends to working in a tailor shop, he rises to the top of the fashion industry as chief designer for Givenchy and head of his own legendary fashion line, as his fashion shows become theatrical and artistic spectacles, attracting countless celebrities. “Seeking to find beauty in the most devastating aspects of life, McQueen envisions and creates clothes to empower women in response to what is happening in his life and the world around him. Fighting against the commercial interests of legendary houses like Givenchy and Gucci to remain provocative, he challenges norms and pushes boundaries as an artist. In the end, the fight consumes him.” Directing House of McQueen is Angels in America director Sam Helfrich, while Rick Lazes (Lennox Lewis: The Untold Story), and McQueen's nephew, Gary James, are both joining as executive producer and creative director, respectively. The rest of the cast for the show is yet to be announced. Newton is not the only Bridgerton star to appear on stage after starring in the steamy period drama. His co-star, Jonathan Bailey, who plays his on-screen older brother Viscount Anthony Bridgerton, has been praised for his turn in the Shakespeare classic, Richard II. Meanwhile, other series stars, including Adoja Andoh, Luke Thompson, Golda Rosheuvel, and Regé-Jean Page, have an impressive collection of theatre credits.

17e5db41e3e140693166594933c52544,2025-07-09 04:55:00,en,WEB,"  The late Queen Elizabeth allegedly 'saw through' Meghan Markle, and claimed her romance with Harry had become a 'complete catastrophe', just weeks before her death in September 2022. Prince Harry and his wife have always been at pains to stress that they enjoyed a warm bond with the late Queen, despite a rift with the other senior royals that has only deepened over the years. However, this week the Sussexes up and down relationship with the late Queen was revealed by journalist and royal biographer Sally Bedell Smith on her Substack Royal Extras, after her conversations with Her Majesty's late cousin Lady Elizabeth Anson. Lady Eliza, as she was known to friends, told Ms Bedell Smith that Harry had been 'rude' to his grandmother for 10 minutes during a meeting about his wedding and Meghan refused to disclose details of her dress, leaving the monarch 'saddened'. Her comments echo claims made previously in the Spectator magazine, that relations between Meghan, Harry and his grandmother were rather more complicated than the Sussexes have made out. According to a source, the Queen made some strongly-worded remarks about Meghan and Harry's union to guests at Balmoral just a month before she died. The source said: 'It was out of character for the Queen...but she saw straight through Meghan. 'At the drinks before the dinner, a small group were talking to the monarch and she explained that Harry meeting Meghan had become a complete catastrophe. Queen Elizabeth II and Meghan at an event in Cheshire in June 2018. During Meghan's brief time as a working royal, the Duchess and the Queen found themselves at loggerheads Meghan at the Queen's funeral. The late Queen allegedly described Meghan as 'evil' TRENDING 'By this point we all knew the Queen's health was in decline and she had months left, she seemed regretful about how things had panned out.' By this stage, Harry and Meghan had stepped down as working royals and were living a new life in Montecito. When 'Megxit' was announced in January 2020, the late monarch released a statement saying: 'Harry, Meghan and Archie will always be much loved members of my family.' That is not to say that relations between the couple and the monarch were always on an amicable footing with things beginning to sour during the planning of the couple's wedding, according to Lady Liza Anson. Born in Windsor Castle, Lady Elizabeth, a great-niece of the Queen Mother and a goddaughter of King George VI, was a high-society party planner. SCROLL DOWN TO CONTINUE ARTICLE The Queen's first cousin, who arranged the Queen's 80th birthday party, allegedly said just days before Meghan and Harry's wedding: 'We hope but don't quite think she is in love. We think she engineered it all.' Meghan was apparently 'full of charm' and appeared 'natural, intelligent, and thoughtful' after she became engaged to Harry in 2017. But as the wedding approached, Meghan allegedly became increasingly 'bossy' and Liza said the Queen was privately 'very worried'. Ms Bedell Smith wrote: 'When we spoke two weeks before the May 19 wedding, Liza had just heard from the Queen. “The Number One Lady—I call her Jemima—says the jury is out on whether she likes Meghan,” said Liza. “My Jemima is very worried.” In Liza's view, “Harry is besotted and weak about women. Liza apparently said: 'It's worrying that so many people are questioning whether Meghan is right for Harry. The problem, bless his heart, is that Harry is neither bright nor strong, and she is both'. The cracks apparently appeared in February 2018. Liza claimed Harry wrote to her and said that his grandmother was 'content' with the way the wedding plans were coming along. But Sally Bedell Smith wrote that Liza had said: 'When I spoke with the Queen, she said she is not at all content'. Ms Bedell Smith wrote: 'According to Liza, the Queen was dismayed that Harry had asked the Archbishop of Canterbury to perform the wedding service in St. George's Chapel without first requesting permission from the Dean of Windsor. “Harry seems to think the Queen can do what she wants, but she can't,” said Liza. “On the religious side, it is the Dean of Windsor's jurisdiction.” As a result, Liza said that “Harry has blown his relationship with his grandmother. She said she was really upset. I was shocked when the Queen told me this, how she was so saddened. I had no idea about the conversation, that he was rude to her for ten minutes. They had tea with her the day before yesterday. She was trying to find out about the wedding dress, and Meghan wouldn't tell her.” .' Liza at this point predicted that Meghan could 'turn into nothing but trouble', remarking that the Suits actress 'sees things in a different way'. Hosted by Royal Historians Robert Hardman and Professor Kate Williams, Queens, Kings, and Dastardly Things looks at the Royal Family - the secrets, the palace intrigues, and the Crown's bloodiest moments. Following these February rows, towards the end of April, Liza claimed that “the Queen and Harry have patched things up'. Harry apparently visited her alone to smooth things over and later wrote to with more wedding details. Sally Bedell Smith wrote: 'Liza also said that Meghan's father, Thomas Markle, was “frightened of coming to the wedding.” I asked her if Meghan was being bossy. “So I gather,” Liza replied, “Very much so.” 'My Jemima is very worried', Liza apparently added. Ingrid Seward, one of the most prominent and respected writers on the British Royal Family, also discussed the nuptials in her book, My Mother and I. The royal biographer wrote: 'The Queen never voiced her true opinions except to her close confidants, such as Lady Elizabeth Anson, or Liza as she was known to her friends. 'She told me that the Queen had made only one remark about Meghan and Harry's wedding and that was that Meghan's Givenchy wedding gown was ""too white"".' 'In the monarch's view, it was not appropriate for a divorcee getting remarried in church to look quite so flamboyantly virginal,' Seward added...."

Emmanuel Macron was welcomed to Windsor Castle for a glittering banquet on Tuesday, as he was pictured clinking glasses and winking at royals. The French president sat amongst the likes of Mick Jagger and Elton John at the star-studded event on the first day of his state visit to the UK. The Princess of Wales was dressed in a dark red silk Givenchy gown as she sat next to Mr Macron for her first state banquet since her cancer diagnosis. The president was pictured winking and chatting with Kate as she sat next to Mr Macron wearing her favourite Lover's Knot tiara – a piece much loved by Diana, Princess of Wales. The princess and and her husband, the Prince of Wales, were pictured smiling and gazing at each other as they arrived together, walking side by side before the banquet at the castle. They were joined by other members of the royal family including the King and Queen, plus some 160 guests, in Windsor Castle's impressive St George's Hall. The King was seated between Mr Macron and French culture minister Rachida Dati, while Kate was on the other side of the French president. The Queen was on the other side of the table, between Brigitte Macron and French armed forces minister Sebastien Lecornu. On the other side of Mrs Macron was heir to the throne William. Staff said the table had taken six days to set up, with a highly polished table running the length of the room, decorated with hand-picked seasonal flowers and herbs from palace gardens. The menu, which was written in French as is the custom for state banquets, began with a selection of tender summer vegetables from the Gardens of Le Manoir with Sage, Raw Tomato and Extra Virgin Olive Oil Dressing. The next course was Supreme of Rhug Estate Chicken with Norfolk Asparagus and Tarragon Cream, followed by Iced Blackcurrant Parfait on a Blackcurrant-soaked Sponge with Elderflower Jelly for dessert. In a tradition started by the King, a cocktail was also created specially for the occasion, this time called L'entente. It combined British gin with lemon curd and French pastis, garnished with dried French cornflowers and English roses. Both the monarch and President delivered speeches at the event, where prime minister Sir Keir Starmer was also present.

Of those 15 tiara moments, 10 of them have been in the Queen Mary Lovers' Knot tiara—which was also the favorite tiara of Princess Diana. The Princess of Wales wore the Lovers' Knot tiara again on July 8 for a state banquet honoring France's President Emmanuel Macron and First Lady Brigitte Macron at Windsor Castle. Every tiara tells a story, and the deliberate choice of Kate Middleton wearing the Queen Mary Lovers' Knot tiara to last night's French state banquet is no exception. The Princess of Wales's favorite tiara—like her mother-in-law Princess Diana before her—is the Lovers' Knot, worn for 10 of the future queen's 15 tiara moments so far since marrying into the royal family in 2011. As Maxwell Stone of U.K. jeweler Steven Stone pointed out, the Lovers' Knot was the “very first Kate wore as Princess of Wales, making the moment deeply meaningful,” estimating that the sparkler is valued $135 million, “or potentially more, considering the legacies of the remarkable women who have worn it,” Stone said. “This piece is a true royal treasure,” he said of the tiara, adding that it is “renowned for its existing craftsmanship.” Kate Middleton and France's President Emmanuel Macron on July 8, 2025. Getty “The tiara is famously heavy enough to have caused discomfort to Princess Diana, underscoring the exceptional quality of the diamonds and pearls it holds,” Stone said. The tiara—which was reportedly so heavy it gave Diana headaches—was created in 1914 by Garrard for Queen Mary, who, following her death in 1953, passed the topper down to her granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth. After Diana married Prince Charles in 1981, the Queen gave the tiara to her, and she wore it many times throughout her royal life before returning it to the Queen following her divorce from Charles in 1996. The tiara wasn't seen again until her daughter-in-law Kate wore it nearly two decades later, bringing it out of the vault in 2015 for a diplomatic reception at Buckingham Palace. Prince William and Kate Middleton. Getty The Princess of Wales—who wore bespoke red Sarah Burton for Givenchy Tuesday evening—often pairs the Lovers' Knot tiara with Queen Elizabeth's Greville Diamond Chandelier Earrings, created by Cartier. The earrings were made in London in 1918 and modified over a period of 11 years, until 1929, when they were completed in the style seen up to the present day. No one could ever accuse the Princess of Wales of not being an immensely thoughtful dresser—and July 8 was no exception. In wearing Sarah Burton for Givenchy, she masterfully honored a British designer—Burton, who 14 years ago (while working with Alexander McQueen) designed Kate's own wedding dress—while also honoring a French fashion house. Earlier in the day, in wearing Dior, she again honored a French fashion house, one which recently named Jonathan Anderson—who hails from Northern Ireland—as its creative director.

Getty The red color of Kate's Givenchy gown was not only one of France's national colors, but her Givenchy clutch—embroidered with lily of the valley—was also symbolic. Per People, the flower “traditionally represents happiness, humility, and motherhood, and in France, it's gifted on May 1 (La Fête du Muguet) as a token of luck and renewal.” Tying it all up with a bow, Christian Dior considered lily of the valley “his lucky bloom, frequently incorporating it into his designs,” People reported. Last night, Kate also debuted her Royal Family Order of King Charles III, a badge featuring a miniature portrait of her father-in-law with a pale blue ribbon. Stone said it was “truly heartwarming” to see Kate honor her role as Princess of Wales by wearing the first tiara she chose in her current position, which he called “a beautiful symbol of continuity, respect, and royal heritage.”"

The Princess of Wales opted for a design by Givenchy, with Queen Camilla favoring one of her go-to designers, Fiona Clare, and Macron styled a custom royal blue cape gown by Louis Vuitton for the special occasion. Middleton's bespoke Givenchy gown was designed by Sarah Burton, who also designed the British royal family member's ornate lace wedding gown worn to her Westminster nuptials to Prince William in April 2011. The Princess of Wales' gown featured flowing chiffon fabric, with a sleeveless design, cinched waist for added silhouette definition and an elegant skirt. The gown also featured a cape element over the British royal's shoulders. Middleton carried the Lily of the Valley Embroidered Evening Clutch courtesy of Givenchy. As for finishing touches and further accessories, she wore a pair of burgundy velvet pumps by Jimmy Choo and the Queen Mary's Lover's Knot Tiara and the Greville Chandelier Earrings (both from Queen Elizabeth II's personal collection). The tiara is estimated to be worth roughly $1.3 million, according to the experts at Steven Stone in London. The tiara was designed by Queen Mary and then passed on to her granddaughter, Queen Elizabeth II. Middleton also wore Princess Diana's three-strand pearl bracelet. Queen Camilla wore a Fiona Clare ivory silk gown with embroidery on the front of the skirt and at the hemline and sleeves. She also carried the 'Bella' clutch in silver by Launer London. As for her jewels, Queen Camilla wore the late Queen Elizabeth II's Belgian Sapphire Tiara. She coordinated the tiara with Queen Elizabeth II's matching sapphire and diamond cluster line necklace as well as the sapphire earrings.

The shoulders of the dress also included hand-embroidered black and silver jewel embellishments. Macron accessorized her attire with jewels courtesy of the French luxury fashion house as well.

On July 8, the Prince and Princess of Wales released a new photo of themselves dressed up for the state banquet at Windsor Castle, celebrating the state visit from France. ""Ready for what promises to be a wonderful State Banquet this evening in Windsor,"" their team wrote below the portrait shared to the couple's official social media accounts, adding emojis of the French flag and Great Britain's Union Jack. The Prince and Princess of Wales, both 43, were the picture of royal elegance in their white-tie attire and royal regalia, where William sported a black tailcoat and Kate wore a red gown with cape by Sarah Burton (her bridal gown designer) for Givenchy. Andrew Parsons / Kensington Palace Kate Middleton and Prince William in a portrait released on July 9, 2025. The image also revealed Princess Kate's tiara return for the first time since 2023, but that wasn't the only striking aspect. Switching things up, the picture of the Prince and Princess of Wales, credited to Andrew Parsons, was snapped outdoors. Royal portraits commemorating formal occasions like state visits are traditionally taken indoors in settings like state rooms, so it was different for William and Kate to capture such a snap outside. The shot showed them standing close together before a bucolic background below the summer sun. The Prince and Princess of Wales live close to Windsor Castle with their children, Prince George, 11, Princess Charlotte, 10, and Prince Louis, 7, meaning that the diplomatic dinner didn't take them far from home.

Luke Newton may be famed for playing Colin Bridgerton (younger brother of Jonathan Bailey's Lord Anthony Bridgerton) on the Netflix period costume drama, but he's about to take on a whole new role – that of decidedly more modern, and openly gay, fashion designer Alexander McQueen. The 32-year-old English actor will portray the late London-born designer in the play ""House of McQueen"" by Darrah Cloud. The Off Broadway play is set to ""begin previews August 19 at The Mansion at Hudson Yards, with an official opening set for September 9,"" Deadline reported , with direction by Sam Helfrich. In addition to being a new play, ""House of McQueen"" ""will be the first production at the new Hudson Yards, Manhattan, venue,"" Deadline noted. The play's website describes the new stage work as being ""about the life and work of iconic fashion designer Alexander McQueen as told from his own revolutionary, daring and elegant perspective."" ""It is the story of a boy born in the east end of London, who literally wears his heart on his sleeve, never meant to rise beyond his working-class family,"" the description continues. ""From making doll clothes for his mother's friends to working in a tailor shop, he rises to the top of the fashion industry as chief designer for Givenchy and head of his own legendary fashion line, as his fashion shows become theatrical and artistic spectacles, attracting countless celebrities."" ""Seeking to find beauty in the most devastating aspects of life, McQueen envisions and creates clothes to empower women in response to what is happening in his life and the world around him,"" the site says. ""Fighting against the commercial interests of legendary houses like Givenchy and Gucci to remain provocative, he challenges norms and pushes boundaries as an artist."" ""In the end, the fight consumes him,"" the description summarizes. McQueen died in 2010 at the age of 40. McQueen became known for his low-rise jeans, called ""bumsters,"" as well as for his provocative designs and runway shows. He designed for recording stars like Lady Gaga – who wore his famed ""armadillo shoes"" – Björk, and David Bowie. McQueen's bold designs and dramatic fashion shows excited the fashion world but also led to allegations of misogyny , though the designer himself said he wished to ""empower women"" with his clothes. Deadline quoted Rick Lazes, who serves as an executive producer for the production, calling it an ""absolute pleasure to announce Luke's involvement with 'House of McQueen'"" and praising Newton as an ""incredibly impressive multi-hyphenate."" Aside from ""Bridgerton"" – the fourth season of which is expected to arrive at Netflix next year – Newton ""recently wrapped production on the upcoming sci-ﬁ thriller 'White Mars,' opposite Lucy Hale,"" Deadline noted. by Kilian Melloy , EDGE Staff Reporter Kilian Melloy serves as EDGE Media Network's Associate Arts Editor and Staff Contributor.

Amazon's mini Christmas in July has consumers clicking on fashion — and there are more apparel brands in the promotional mix, including vintage designer style from ReBag as well as looks from Michael Kors, Naadam and more. Prime Day, which extended to four days this year and ends on Friday, has become a fixture on the retail calendar, prompting competing deals from other retailers. Altogether, retailers are expected to see $23.8 billion in sales, or the equivalent of two Black Fridays, according to Adobe. At Amazon, the event has had a strong fashion start. Numerator is tracking the e-commerce giant's Prime Day take, studying the activity of shoppers at 22,411 households and surveying 2,248 buyers during the sale's first two days. Thirty percent of buyers snatched up Prime Day apparel and footwear — tying for the top spot with cleaning products and other household essentials, according to the data and tech company. But in keeping with the general sense of caution in the market, consumers are being very calculated as they spend. Fifty-one percent of shoppers bought items that they'd been waiting to buy on sale and 37 percent of shoppers bought the same items they typically buy on Amazon. Numerator pegged the average order size on Prime Day at $57.12 and said 51 percent of households have made two or more orders, upping the average household spend to $126.26. Two-thirds of the Prime Day items have sold for under $20 while only 3 percent are over $100. Amazon has been steadily adding to its fashion mix and a company spokesperson pointed to the slate of fashions making their Prime Day debut. For the first time, the luxury resale player Rebag is offering price promotions on looks from Alexander McQueen, Chloé, Delvaux, Givenchy, Jacquemus, Valentino Garavani, Versace and Tom Ford on Amazon. And a host of brands have joined the rush this year and included select items in the event, such as Hervé Léger, Kate Barton, Calzedonia, Vans, Michael Kors and Naadam."

Another film that dazzled with its costumes is 'Pretty Woman,' starring Julia Roberts. The wardrobe ranged from casual to sophisticated, adapting to the character's different facets. One of the most memorable style moments is when the protagonist steps out of her comfort zone at a polo match, wearing a beautiful brown dress with white polka dots, paired with a hat and gloves. That same year, Touchstone Pictures asked them for a song to include in the 'Pretty Woman' soundtrack. While on tour, Per Gessle sent them a song intended for Christmas: 'It Must Have Been Love.' Their most famous song became part of film history, eternalized in the final kiss scene between Richard Gere and Julia Roberts. It was number 1 in 20 countries.

Vanessa Kirby stepped into shine and structure for Thursday's London premiere of “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” wearing Aquazzura's Minute Sandal 105 in metallic silver — the latest entry in her sculptural maternity footwear streak.QUES The Italian-made stilettos featured mirrored leather uppers, two slim straps and a high, tapered heel. A back zip created a clean finish at the ankle, and the brand's signature gold plaque was visible on the sole. The 105mm silhouette added lift without disrupting the overall proportion. Related Stories Kirby paired the sandals with a beaded turquoise dress from Loewe's spring 2025 collection. The strapless midi-length look, styled by Andrew Mukamal, was constructed entirely of layered bead strands that created fringe-like movement across the body. The runway version featured a shorter hemline and metallic underlayer, but Kirby's custom iteration removed any lining to emphasize the vertical drape. Combined with the clean stiletto, the full look felt visually elongated. This marked Kirby's latest footwear-forward look on the “Fantastic Four: First Steps” press tour. Earlier this week in Paris, she wore metallic wraparound stilettos with a lilac Givenchy halter dress. In Mexico, she styled two different Manolo Blahnik silhouettes — including the black snakeskin Paloma heel — with cutout knits and a teal Schiaparelli gown. And at the Alabama trailer launch in February, she wore pointed PVC stilettos with vintage Versace. Across each appearance, Kirby has relied on heels with clean lines and exaggerated finishes — think eye-catching metallics, sheer panels and snakeskin — to ground dresses that range from architectural to body-conscious. “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” marks the Marvel franchise's official reboot under Disney, introducing a new cast led by Kirby, Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. Directed by Matt Shakman, the film serves as both an origin story and launchpad for the characters' integration into the broader MCU, ahead of their expected crossover appearances in “Avengers: Secret Wars.” The film opens in U.S. theaters on July 25.

今年6月，纽约长岛一座私人庄园里，举行了一场低调奢华的婚礼，整个美国上流社会几乎全部聚集在这里。 宾客名单包括奥巴马夫妇、克林顿夫妇、希拉里、副总统哈尔斯以及传媒业巨头，再加华尔街精英。 相信你也看出来了，婚礼的主人既富又贵。 新郎是39岁的亚历山大.索罗斯。 没错，就是那个金融大鳄，富可敌国，随便动动手指全球经济就要抖三抖的索罗斯。 而新娘，不仅比新郎大9岁，离异带娃，儿子14岁，还曾深陷性丑闻，因为私生活导致事业全线崩溃。 她曾经差点就从地铁站台跳下去，一了百了。 如今她身穿一条Givenchy高定白裙嫁人，下摆的橄榄枝刺绣是唯一的点缀，除了耳环没有任何首饰，全凭自身优雅气质撑场。 她那身家250亿美金的老公，全程笑得见牙不见眼，像是捡到了绝世珍宝。 她整个婚礼的造型，由全美名利场公认品味最好的女魔头安娜包办。 安娜可不是砸钱就能请到的造型师。 你看她在桑切斯身边这坐立难安的样子。 她肯出手为新娘做造型，这几乎代表着全美时尚圈的高度认可。 婚礼当天飘着毛毛细雨，所有迎宾打起白伞，按我们中国人的审美，这场面肃穆到有点让人分不清是喜是丧。 礼成时，新娘14岁的儿子上前拥抱母亲，两人相拥而泣。 “爱的海啸席卷了我们，我沉浸在喜悦之中，充满幸福和感激。” 这行泪，一半是因为太过幸福，另一半是因为洗尽屈辱。 因为过去的14年，对于新娘来说是从云端跌落谷底，从人人称羡的名流一夜坠落为“全美笑柄”的过程。 新娘名叫胡玛Huma Abedin，希拉里最信任的心腹，中东问题的操盘手。 单亲妈妈拿下年下多金、高知巨富小奶狗，政商联姻、千亿豪门！ 咱就是说，网剧都不敢这么编！ 现实就这么摆在了你面前。 胡玛这是拿的什么剧本？ 她如何做到的？ 一 
胡玛的前半生，是中产家庭培养女儿的范本。 她1976年7月28日生于美国密歇根州，父母是印度裔穆斯林学者。 胡玛幼年随父母移居沙特阿拉伯，在吉达生活至18岁。 胡玛的父亲赛义德·阿贝丁是伊斯兰社会学专家，母亲萨利玛·阿贝丁则创办了《阿拉伯穆斯林研究杂志》。 这是一个标准的书香门第。 胡玛在1996年进入乔治·华盛顿大学，主修新闻与国际关系。 同年暑期，她进入白宫实习，成为第一夫人希拉里·克林顿的助手。 这是多么漂亮的履历。 胡玛的身上，充满着希拉里的“影子” 。 初期，她负责希拉里日程安排与信函处理，日均工作18小时。 四年后，胡玛随希拉里进入参议院，担任副幕僚长。 2008年，工作12年的胡玛任希拉里竞选团队旅行总监，协调全球行程。 同事称她“能在5分钟内搞定别人5天办不成的事”。 2009年，胡玛出任副幕僚长，经手所有机密文件。 《纽约时报》称她为“希拉里的第二个大脑”。 希拉里更是把胡玛当做自己的女儿对待。 胡玛的身上有野心有毅力，有强大的判断能力也有冷静的头脑。 《VOGUE》的专访这样形容她： 
    “胡玛·阿贝丁只睡了三个小时，喝了四杯咖啡，但她身穿的黑色普拉达套装毫无褶皱，皮肤完美无瑕。” 这个事业上如此成功的女人，同时还拥有无懈可击的外型。 全白宫最会穿的女人 
How？ 为什么小编我只是写1000字就困得想随地躺倒？ 大家都是人类，怎么基础设施区别这么大！ 作为女性，胡玛几乎是完美的。 她有高学历带来的高认知水准，同时手握美国社会最上层资源，她的美貌不肤浅，她的优秀有目共睹。 她值得最上等的婚姻，就是那种传说中珠联璧合的神仙眷侣。 一开始，胡玛也是这么以为的。..."
