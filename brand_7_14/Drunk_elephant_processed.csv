1lb7rin,2025-06-14 12:39:48,en,REDDIT,"  Tldr; I fostered a Frenchie for 1.5 years & when I gave it to the owner it dies after 2 days. Kryptonite is to Superman, as dogs are to me(M30) & my gf (29). A few years ago (~2 1/2), one of my friends from old(I'll call him JK), purchased a Frenchie & placed himself in a predicament. He couldn't care for the dog, so he asked me to foster him for a few months until he could find a buyer. Problem is, he couldn't find one ~ and another problem was, this puppy was incredibly hard to care for. While my gf and I learned and adapted to this pup, we grew quite fond of him. We ended up purchasing Kilo (FrencheiBoi) from JK as we got quite attached to Kilo, as we've fostered him for a few months now. It was also to secure legal ownership over Kilo as well, mainly due to what we learned those first few months. Boy were those an intense 12 weeks looking after something we had no idea how to deal with. As cute as kilo was, he's pure white which translates to skin allergies out the ass. The dude was pink and red and I couldn't sleep for days because I stayed up watching him to make sure he was okay. It wasn't even my dog which stressed us out even more, all this on top of juggling him and us between my gf's parents  house and my parents house. All this isn't going unnoticed by our parents either. Questions left and right about what we're going to do with this dog. Regardless of the struggles, my gfs job is very steady and wfh, and my job allows me to fixate my schedule a day in advance, sometimes. We had the means to get through this while maintaining Kilos safety. But then it dawned on us. How the hell is anyone supposed to handle this guy, if they have a life? He's a full time job on his own and a commitment at that. So we did the reasonable thing and just ended up buying him. But buying him without a place was another problem. Our folks had a point. We were focused on the wrong thing. Taking care of a dog was one thing, but primarily we needed to focus on moving on. For all they knew, us purchasing the pup just extended the amount of time we'd stay at home. So it's time to move out(or in depending on how ya look at it). My Gf, Myself & her parents came up with a deal. A family friend owns the house and wants to sell, and boy does this work out. The four of us end up splitting the house in two. We take basement & they the upstairs. So after another 4 months, we have a house and a dog and a ton of newly discovered responsibilities. But that's life for everyone. We adapt, learn and move forward. Kilo the dog is very low maintenance on his own and he learned commands quite quickly as well. He's also well built for the breed, longer legs that stand under him, and his posture is always held upwards. 26lbs (12 or so kilos) but lean and muscular w no outward belly. The frenchie part however, put my gf and I to work. Every other week was something new. And while he'd always recover, he'd always have something else happen to him too. The elephant is addressed. We knew frenchies had many issues prior to even thinking about kilo. It's an obvious statement to make and any vet would be happy to let ya know. I would never have gone out of my way to purchase a Frenchie as I knew the breed needed extra care. But the amount of it was something I'd never been exposed to before. We were able to do this due to sheer luck and a bit of willpower. And I mean a-lot of luck. A few of the things we did to care for this dude: -Alternate sleep schedules to make sure he didn't throw up in his sleep to verify if his food was okay - fixed through soft palate surgery @2yrs -He also developed paraphamosis during his sleep as well. And he's a bit endowed so it got stuck stuck...."

I loved [the ""Elephantburger I had](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1kdfos8/recent_eats_elephant_castle_taqueria_by_el_prieto/) the last time I was there, so I had high hopes for brunch today, and I wasn't disappointed. This is poached eggs with balsamic, tarragon, tomatoes, avocado, and shrooms, and it comes with a toasted English muffin. I love anything where I get to engage in Lunchables-style mechanics. This mix was *very* good, with perfectly poached eggs and standout shrooms, and the balsamic complemented everything well. This place has made a loyal customer of me and I'll be glad to continue supporting them. Few other patrons on a rainy Saturday afternoon, although I've definitely seen the place packed at other times. [Oasis](https://www.yelp.com/biz/oasis-brooklyn-3) One of the best falafel sandwiches I've had here or anywhere, and I have to say, this place blows Mamoun's out of the water. No contest. Their falafel is more flavorful, their bread is better, and the other fillings more plentiful. Their garlic whip is the real thing, too, not like whatever strange creamy garlic/tahini-hybrid that Mamoun's uses. Probably goes without saying that, being in Williamsburg, they're slightly cheaper as well. Their location is the one and only reason I don't visit more often, though I admit that, being right off the Bedford Ave station, it's as convenient as something can be while not being in Manhattan. [Adobo](https://adobomexicangrill.com/) For sheer value, Adobo is probably the best in this neighborhood. Their burritos are the size that Chipotle's used to be, and they do not skimp on the meat. It's a halal place, so no pork-based options; I recommend the shredded chicken over the grilled chicken. Tons of filling options, including some things that I've seen other places charge extra for (looking at you, [Tacos Grand Central](https://www.reddit.com/r/FoodNYC/comments/1kmn8tu/recent_eats_ursula_comptons_ev_tacos_grand/)). You don't have to take my word on the size, though—just look at the photo. Most of the time I just eat the other half later or the next day. [Peruvian chicken in the Trans-Pecos backyard](https://i.imgur.com/uGrNPYh.png) At [this rave](https://www.instagram.com/p/DJ-CRSXOEUB/) I was at last night, a local resident was [serving up a Peruvian dish](https://i.imgur.com/uGrNPYh.png) of chicken with mayo, ají amarillo (a Peruvian pepper), celery, and lemon, which I'd never seen before. Nicely balanced. The chiles added just the right amount of kick for my tastes.

I also took their advice and added the pickled veggies to my peanut noodles this time for $0.75, and I will now be doing that every time. This dish is already tasty on its own, of course, but the veg adds texture and its tang goes nicely with the peanut sauce. [Original Soupman](https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-original-soupman-new-york-7) First time trying their chicken and rice. Definitely one of their better soups. Honestly, I've never had anything from this place that wasn't at least decent, and I always appreciate the included fruit, bread, and bonbon. Usually I'll haul it to Central Park, but there's also a Wendy's around the corner if you just want a quick place to sit. [Oconomi](https://www.yelp.com/biz/oconomi-long-island-city-3) Caught these guys at the last WTC Smorgasburg. This here is their ""Modern Yaki"" which is okonomiyaki topped with yakisoba, a fried egg, sriracha, Kewpie mayo, and some kind of Japanese BBQ sauce. Yeah, big ol' mound of food, I doubt anyone in Japan does this to okonomiyaki unless they're drunk but it was delicious. I showed [the bare ones](https://i.imgur.com/1SHchX1.jpg) to my Japanese mom and she said they were gigantic compared to what she knew from the old country. But she'd still eat them. [L'industrie (sandwich)](https://www.lindustriebk.com/) 99% of the time I'm going here for their Wednesday sandwich special, not pizza, which means I never have to deal with huge lines since lunchtime/afternoon on Wednesday is not tourist o'clock. This one had chicken cutlet, fresh mozz, cucumbers, avocado, red onion, arugula, and pesto mayo, and I only wonder when they're going to do it again. Wonderful for this time of year. At $20 their sandwiches aren't exactly cheap, and it's not like we don't have other places to get sandwiches in the WV, but if you want this specific combo there's only one time and place to get it (other than the Williamsburg location), unless you make it yourself. [Bleecker Street Pizza](https://bleeckerstreetpizza.com/) Although places like L'industrie and Mama's Too get tons of hype and lines to match, I prefer a classic slice.

I mean the other thing that I came across is the 911 called that nobody in the history of true crime we can't figure out why the 911 call I mean who goes into a house like literally think about the skies nobody's told anybody anything they're just saying oh that we think she's passed out well okay this is the thing, you grab a knife to go check on someone that's passed out?! I'm just so confused by this…and I'm telling you I mean I just can't get past and no I don't even I mean you can call me whatever burger and what not Burger but that's not even that's not even me I'm saying it for what it is that and by the way I live in a small town in Tennessee I literally have been set up before I have done time for something something that I didn't do this is crazy now listen I'm telling you it is possible I'm not saying there is a reason that he is somehow involved I don't know how and if he is I went through Steve g's interviews guys and one thing that bothers me is this is crazy……but guess what yes he was emotional but let me tell you what he meant business and he was like we're not getting this we're not getting that and you know he was getting like he's talking to the investigators and all that he said but remember he said that don't make me be an elephant blah blah and all that stuff well that was interesting becausebasically he said he earned that and all that stuff and it never has left me because he said they put lawyers in between you well could he have been given that lawyer and they didn't even higher that lawyer because ever since and I'm not going to name his name I've never been a fan of this guy…and it's almost like they silence or like silence them or made them think a certain way I don't even know…but it's like the switch happened when they got this lawyer. And I need to do more digging on this I mean that actually just came out of my mouth and I didn't even realize it but oh my God and yeah I'm not being rude to a victim's to the victim's parents by the way I actually am a I'm in this club that nobody wants to be in it's called losing a child I've lost a child that says same thing it was my child was a baby and it never goes away but you want to know every f****** answer up and down and all the way around and I just think that basically they're relieved or they have to go I don't even know it's like I feel like there's something I don't even knowI can't even remember that lawyer's name oh Shannon okay I'm going to look up Shannon because I have a good lawyer friend and oh my gosh okay because something is interesting he said that he said he didn't like it he didn't like how the lawyers or he called them their lawyers and he said don't make me be the alpha blah blah blah but then I swear it wasn't a very long time and then they had their own lawyer but it was like no they actually just needed somebody to speak up for them but then it seems like they got more quiet they didn't even and then they got more louder on a whole other situation and it's just bizarre…and I don't know what's up with that but it's something is just weird…and no I don't think it's strange that like people have like analyze their interviews and stuff like get it right I think that they I think that what Christy was telling Olivia in the beginning to get it right was get the timing right because nobody had been caught which I don't think all the people have been caught or the correct something is not right about all this I mean I just don't understand it because okay I've never heard I've never heard of anybody okay there is such a rug problem in that area as we all know and you're telling me I mean I've never I don't know…like usually they're like okay do you have any narcan have they had any did they do any drugs I mean it's just so weird that the problem with me is not as much as what I'm hearing of the people being passed around the phone and all that I mean that's weird in itself but I can okay whatever but it's more or less the freaking 911 operator thing…and then I mean it's just freaking bizarre. I mean it's really weird. And I mean I don't know whowell we're going to oh yeah we're going to I mean and usually by the way 911 operators and I've talked to several and I literally have and it's crazy and I have listened to several and it's like they will let you speak because trust me oh trust me I even heard myself and listen to mine and I was like don't hold this against me blah blah blah he's down and this is a whole situation that happened to me and that I and anyways long story short I'm telling you what they want they will let you talk they're not like I mean she said literally sounds like an AI person😮 I'll have to look into this and but I'll have to go to the documents but I'm telling you I'm pretty sure her name is on there and has anybody like even look this operator up to even like try to talk to her because I'm telling you what something is off about this and I am I mean I'm actually wondering if like 911 was called prior to that…because I went back to the Dave interview and by the way I thought that didn't didn't didn't tell you show like have Dave on their why in the world did Dave go off of this channel well I found and saved it and I I think I know why he may have taken it off but I don't understand why I don't understand I feel like no offense but I feel like he has switched up…I feel like he I feel like he basicallydoes anybody and I'm not being rude but I'm wondering why we have to have sides I remember when drunk turkey show I forget what's his name Daniel yeah he was like all into this and looking into it but it seems like immediately like we just okay that's it and no I mean no I'm sorry I mean there is like literally something in Maddie's what in the world is going on I mean there are questions so many questions that need to be answered…and I don't get it. And no I'm not a tunnel girl I'm not a blah blah blah and somebody parachuted in I don't know I mean it clearly BK I mean it is what it is but I don't understand some of this stuff of how you can go from that and looking into it and then be like oh okay that's it and just totally go with the mainstream narrative and like I don't knowin law enforcement and I guess and I mean if you think of it guys no offense but they're kind of like the biggest gang because they're going to like they're taught a certain way and it's just the way it is and I mean that's just not that's his perspective so if he's talked to well of course the guns offices and the Gonzales have been lied to well they're going to believe what they've been told because they're grieving parents but something is not right I don't know I don't know it's something is so weird about this"

Inside the William W. Larsen Memorial Library, a sense of wonder is palpable among the shelves stuffed with books on magic, mosaic stained glass and photos of the Larsen family founders and many famous magicians who've graced its halls. On a recent afternoon, comedic magician Justin Willman sits in a plush, burgundy velvet chair fit for a wizard, soaking in the gravitas of a place known for carrying sacred magic texts signed by Harry Houdini. “This is the only room in the Magic Castle where nonmagicians are not allowed. This is a rare exception,” he says. “But you're not allowed to crack a book open.” In the spirit of not inviting any extra curses this week, we take him at his word. Though magic is definitely serious business for the star of the hit Netflix show “Magic for Humans” and more recently the streamer's “Magic Prank Show,” Willman's new special, “Magic Lovers,” aims its wand at our childlike sense of wonder through smartly executed tricks that lead the audience's mind through twists and turns with plenty of laughs along the way. Premiering Tuesday, the hourlong special thrives on Willman's mix of crowd work, storytelling and intricate tricks inspired by everyday life. The goal is to engage skeptics and fans alike from the comfort of their couch. Willman spoke to The Times about what inspired this new special, his most transcendent moments on stage, past performances bloopers and his secret to keeping his illusions weighted in reality. Q. Your debut Netflix special combines comedy and magic with the goal of appealing to both the magic lovers and skeptics. How does “Magic Lovers” showcase your talent for people who want to enjoy the experience of magic as well as those who just want to figure out how you do what you do? A. I think when people hear magic, they come into the theater with an idea about how they feel about the art form as a whole. There's the people who love magic, who already know that they like magic — I love those people. But the people who they bring with them, they sometimes look at magic as a puzzle or as a challenge. Or they just get hung up on the idea “does this guy really think that we think that he's a wizard?” I like the idea of addressing that elephant in the room right off the bat, because I really want to do a show for everybody. I'm not trying to turn the skeptics into magic lovers necessarily, but I want them to know that this show is also for them. I like to do a trick where [the audience] thinks they know how I do it, and then let them know you're right. And then let them know — actually, you're wrong. It's kind of like a little bit of a mini-roller-coaster. Q. How do you view the relationship between magic and comedy? A. They're like kissing cousins. I feel like my live show that I tour with finally got to a place where it held up for the people on the couch [watching at home on TV]. Because magic is a live art form. There's so much doubt that can get in your mind when you are not there in person watching it. Especially these days, you've got AI and deepfakes, so I think magic, more than ever, is this beautiful thing to be experienced live and in person. And I wanted to try as best I could to make the people who are watching it on Netflix feel like they were there in the theater that night and make them a part of the audience. Q. You have this fascination with numbers in your act — specifically guessing the correct city associated with ZIP codes shouted out by members of the audience during the special. How did you become obsessed enough to get so good at that? A. As a kid, I just loved that math and magic have this connection. I was always fascinated by that. But then when I graduated college, I started touring college campuses all over the country, doing the NACA [National Assn. for Campus Activities] circuit. And I hit all 50 states pretty quick. And that was where this love of just ZIP codes and telling people where they were from came to life again and gradually became part of the act. People like to be seen for where they're from. They like to think about the nostalgia of where they came from. And I feel like mixing some things that are real with some things that are obviously an illusion is kind of fun. It just throws a little extra layer on there and makes people wonder, “What the heck is up with that guy?” Q. What's your thought process when it comes to developing a magic trick? A. There's never one consistent path. Sometimes an idea will come fully formed, and I'm like, “Oh, I got it!” And that normally is because it was inspired by something that happened in my life.

A pair of waterproof wireless earbuds that look just like AirPods Pro — *but* these have an LED display to show you the battery percentage on the case. These don't have noise cancellation like the Pros do, but if that's not something you're looking for, this swap will help you save a LOT of pretty pennies. The earbuds last up to 6 hours on a single charge and are sweatproof, meaning they can transition seamlessly from your phone call to a running session around your neighborhood. Promising review: ""I use these every day at work! Love these — easy to learn and to use. Best thing about them? Well, everything, lol. Good sound, they hold a charge for long periods, and I don't have to worry about them losing power. I can answer my phone easily and then go back to music without a problem. Definitely a great buy and worth the money! Love this color, too!"" —Erin Get it from Amazon for $25.98 (available in eight colors). 2. And a pair of wireless over-the-ear headphones with the same sleek, shiny shell design of AirPods Max. These have pretty decent noise cancellation (according to reviewers) and a built-in mic to answer calls, and they feel super comfy on your ears with their extra padding. For only 20 bucks, they're a much safer (and wallet-friendly) purchase if you're unsure about Apple's headphones — they are over $500, after all... It has 10 hours of battery life, too! iJoy is a small business that specializes in headphones and tech accessories. Check out why BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord loves these: I own a pair of these, and because I'm vain as heck and need to own all things pink, but I was decently surprised by how well they muffle noise! I feel like these are ideal for people who still want to hear some of the world around them (read: parents, people working in open offices), but still want to listen to their tunes comfortably. The charge on these goes for at least four hours (I haven't tried it beyond that yet), and the Bluetooth connects to my devices super easily. Excellent pair of headphones for the price point. Promising review: ""To be honest, I wanted the Apple ones because I felt it would be better for me, but my financial situation wouldn't allow me to get them. I made the decision to get these. These are very cute and comfortable. I have really enjoyed them...The sound is good and the calls are clear. Great for the price. I haven't been disappointed. So if you're in a bind and need headphones, you will definitely love these. They are not 100% soundproof, but they do have some noise reduction, and your caller can still hear you clearly outside."" —Carolinee J. Cowart Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in five colors). 3. A cubic zirconia ring that looks so much like a Cartier Love Ring, people will think you dropped BANDS for it. People will undoubtedly compliment your bling, so in the words of Mel Robbins — let them. ☺ Promising review: ""The perfect non-name-brand ring you can find honestly. I wasn't looking for a Cartier knock-off when I found this ring, but I have had people ask me if it's the real deal. I honestly love this ring though, the sizing was accurate, it is weighted well, none of the 'diamonds' have fallen off, and it hasn't tarnished! I've worn it daily for almost a year now and it has held up well. It has some very small scratches on it, but that's typical of most rings. For the price, I am super happy with this ring, and I honestly can't believe how well it has handled everything I've put it through."" —Eva Richterkessing Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in sizes 5–12, three finishes, and two styles). 4.

Major brands are facing pressure: Shiseido reported an 8.5% drop in sales, with its prestige skincare brand Drunk Elephant experiencing a 65% decline (Source: Cosmetics Business). e.l.f.

So why the struggle when the 𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗼𝗿 𝗯𝗲𝗮𝘂𝘁𝘆 𝗶𝘀 𝗮𝘀 𝘀𝘁𝗿𝗼𝗻𝗴 𝗮𝘀 𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗿?

Retailers are already adapting. Ulta Beauty is expanding its Korean skincare assortment to meet the growing demand for K-beauty. At the same time, body care is quietly becoming one of the fastest-growing segments in the category. '𝘁 𝗱𝗲𝗺𝗮𝗻𝗱. 𝗜𝘁' . Too many brands are missing where the consumer is.

mov_78E419AE1F94D4619AB227F531E915C2,2025-06-18 13:07:19,en,WEB,"  What happens when you send three improv actors into a sting operation? This movie happens. In one of the more rewatchable films to go straight to Prime video, Bryce Dallas Howard (Jurassic World, Argylle), Orlando Bloom (pirates Of The Caribbean, Gran turismo), and Nick Mohammed (Ted Lasso) find themselves asked to do their duty for their country, and get paid to do it. As aspiring actors who have either barely been or never were, this is an opportunity they can't turn down. Their oddball pairing works, with Howard actually playing a bit more of the straight man character, leaving Bloom for an uncharacteristically hilarious performance, and Mohammed as the relative newbie still learning how and when to “Yes And”. These three are pulled in by Detective Billings (Sean Bean, in a role he was either drunk for, or on elephant tranquilizers), and he serves as their lone contact. As they continue to “Yes And…” their way deeper into a criminal underground, soon they become recognized as such, and he's their only hope of regaining their lives and getting out of their fake life of crime. Additionally, Paddy Consadine and Ian Mcshane notably pop up.bloom is a scene stealer, playing a classically trained actor who once had a glimpse of real acting, but is now relegated to erection commercials. he's very committed, and very method, and it is the best performance I've seen from him in years. Honestly, maybe ever. He's so uncharacteristically good in this, I'm surprised no one has tapped him to do more action comedies. And Mohammed, looking to make more of a star turn after Ted Lasso, is also quite funny as a beginner, and someone you'd never expect to see in a criminal enterprise. they keep needing to make up a backstory and reason for him to be there, because he seems so suspicious. the plot is predictable, but I had more fun than I thought I would, considering many of Amazon's originals in the last 12 months.The last one I had fun with that skipped theaters was Jackpot, and I was alone in that endeavor. However, the audio description can be lackluster at times, and it certainly has balance issues. It isn't atrocious, but someone chose to not credit themselves, so if we are Alan Smithee-ING this project, then I guess I can say whatever I want about this without consequence. it is never a good sign when a company can't at least get their own name, because there's hours upon hours of proof of other Amazon originals where they at least credit the company. So the mix sucks, but because this film was impregnated with audio description through divine providence like Mary, all I can do is raise my fist to the sky. Curse you audio description Gods! Give us better audio mixes where the sound of the film doesn't defeat the accessibility! And, if this is a polytheistic world of gods, where one is in charge of audio description, are they from the Roman or Greek lineage? was this task assigned to an existing god? Should I take this up with Athena or Demeter? For an industry working really hard through unions to make sure they get credit where credit is due, someone should have fought harder to have their name on this. I've heard much worse, but I also don't know which company to yell at and tell them to fix their balance. You may like this film. it is the kind of entertaining buddy action comedy stuff summer lineups used to be made of. Fresh: Final Grade: B-, Audio description: B-"

After a year of being broken up and no contact we were at the same party. I wanted to have a friendly chat to ensure things were cool and it wouldn't be awkward for us and everyone else (it was the elephant in the room), instead she brought along her new boyfriend and made out with him in front of everyone. The room fell silent and people looked at me to see my reaction. I honestly wasn't bothered and found it somewhat amusing. In a weird way it was nice to know she cared enough about it to try and get a reaction as you have to care to hate. I didn't react, I enjoyed my night and spoke to our friends normally. She got shitfaced (Australian for drunk) and asked people to leave the party early and go clubbing with her and her bf. Nobody wanted to because it was rude to the birthday girl. Anyway that's the tee up. And my amazing petty revenge was… nothing. I did absolutely nothing and didn't give her a reaction at all. She left the party early visibly upset and I got praised by many on my composure. Moral of the story is that sometimes the best revenge is to show you don't care. To want revenge = to care. Giving them absolutely nothing and living your life normally is the best sweetest revenge there is."

mov_DCC605DECFCE224CAD42D25814DC9055,2025-06-19 07:07:03,en,WEB,"  A PhD student believed to be one of Britain's worst ever sex offenders is facing years in prison for raping unconscious women while filming the attacks as souvenirs. Zhenhao Zou, 28, targeted victims on dating apps and social media chat groups, luring them to his home with the offer of extra study sessions before lacing their drinks with . When two of his victims came forward to speak about their ordeals, officers arrested Zou and uncovered a horrifying collection of videos showing him having sex with women who were either unconscious or semi-conscious and pleading for him to stop. Zou – who was studying for a PhD at (UCL) – had also amassed a grim collection of trophies taken from his victims, including clothing, jewellery, and a lipstick. Zou is set to be sentenced on Thursday by Judge Rosina Cottage KC at Inner crown court, having been convicted by a jury of 11 counts of against ten women. After the guilty verdicts in March, the judge dubbed Zou a “dangerous and predatory sexual offender” who faces a “very long” jail term. She could impose a life sentence. Zou went on trial when just two of the ten victims in the charges had been identified by the Metropolitan Police. He was convicted of raping the unknown women thanks to the videos he himself had filmed. Police say they have 50 more videos apparently showing Zou raping and sexually abusing women, and detectives have appealed for help finding possible victims. In April, Scotland Yard said 20 women had come forward in the wake of publicity around the trial and conviction. “He could be one of the most dangerous, prolific sex offenders we have seen in British history“, said Commander Kevin Southworth, who is overseeing the police investigation. “The deceitful, calculating, predatory nature of what Zou has done is fairly unprecedented.” Zou, who comes from a wealthy Chinese family in the Guangdong Province, moved to the UK in 2017 to study Queen's University in Belfast, he signed up for a Masters in mechanical engineering at UCL in 2019, and by the time of his arrest he had entered PhD studies. Zou's victims were attacked in and China between 2019 and 2023. He was living in student accommodation in Bloomsbury and at a £4,000-a-month rented apartment in Elephant and Castle, and made regular trips back to his native country. When he was arrested, police found an array of drugs - MDMA, chemsex favourite GHB, Ketamine, and Xanax – at his luxury London apartment. It is believed he used some of the drugs to knock out his victims, and he had spy-cameras set up in his bedroom. One of the women came forward to police after she spent an evening drinking with Zou in Chinatown, central London, and later that evening woke up to find him having sex with her. She told the trial she felt “angry“ and “ashamed“ in the aftermath of the attack, but was also confused about whether she had been the victim of a crime. “I didn't even know how should I start talking about this“, she said. The woman confronted Zou by text, and told the court: “He said to me on the phone that he thought I was conscious at the time - I didn't agree. “ She went to police after seeing a social media post from another Chinese woman, describing Zou having sex with her while she was drunk. The other woman said she was raped after being plied with vodka by Zou at his south London flat, and afterwards she branded Zou “disgusting” and told him: “You should feel guilty for what you did.” Video footage showed Zou insisting the woman finish a large glass of vodka he had made for her, and she was then raped while unconscious. Detectives who arrested Zou found evidence of the luxury life he was living in London, with a wardrobe stuffed with designer clothes, bags, and jewellery and a 39th floor apartment with spectacular views of London. He told the court his father worked for a state-owned enterprise in China, but the true extent of his family's wealth and political connections remains a mystery. During the trial, Zou also revealed he has undergone a series of cosmetic surgery operations, including a hair transplant, chin implants, and an operation on his eyelids. He also admitted wearing make-up for no other reason than to “look better”. Zou claimed in his defence that he had been introduced to illegal drugs at parties and London nightclubs, and said he imported substances directly from China to the UK. He was also questioned on his disturbing interest in 'time-stop' pornography, which depicts sex with women who appear to have been frozen in time. “I like for the girls to be still and quiet when they are having sex“, he said, and asked about videos of women having sex while asleep, he replied: “That's my favourite type.” Zou, in his defence, claimed the women in the videos had consented to sex, and insisted he was pursuing his interest in “rape role play”. The court heard he used apps like Bumble to target victims as well as Chinese messaging services WeChat and Little Red Book. After the verdicts, UCL said it is “appalled by these horrific offences” and supported the police appeal for more victims to come forward. Zou, of Churchyard Row in Southwark, denied but was convicted of 11 counts of rape, false imprisonment, three counts of voyeurism, ten counts of possessing extreme pornographic images, and three counts of having drugs with intent to commit a sexual offence. The jury found Zou not guilty of two counts of possession of extreme pornographic images, and five charge of possessing drugs with intent to commit a sexual offence. Zou has been held in custody since his arrest."

It's been 4 years since Daniel decided there was very much A Time to Die. The Broccoli dynasty selling, or perhaps offloading 007 to Prime doesn't bode well - see Star Wars/Disney deceased horse flogging exploits. I'm afraid however the sticky wicket here old chap is a bit of a large pachyderm lumbering around the corridors of MI6, how an elephant got security clearance is beyond me but there's also a tangerine hippo in the Whitehouse - strange times indeed. It's not the lacklustre formulaic plots of recent outings (Er Indoors fell asleep during the last one) or the rumbling old chestnut of toxic masculinity, boozing and misogyny. That's not what's got knickers (that can also twist into a semiautomatic weapon) all bunched up. It's far more simple, pretty black and white to be honest. This handsome young chap is Aaron Pierre (great name!) he's the latest British actor to be shoved to the front of the media speculation queue - or should that be Q? Touted as one of the front runners to play Bond. Fine, I'm happy to believe in modern espionage not everyone is white British, or even male (calm down now) in fact in the worlds political hotspots or hollowed out volcanos the old school tie might well stick out a bit. Personally I don't really care what colour James Bond is, he's a fictional character. The problem producers have is he's a British institution - and a white British Navy Commander institution at that - much in the same way Sherlock Holmes isn't the Chinese detective and Miss Marple isn't from Mumbai. If a white actor were to be cast as Shaft there would be immediate howls of protest, questions might well be asked in Parliament - mainly by white British public school males, however if a perfectly fine black actor were to be given the Bond role there would be instant hysterical shrieks of wokism, political correctness gone mad, two for a tanner, three pints to an inch, they should bring back hanging. The irate rustling of Daily Mails would be heard the length and breadth of Blighty. Piers Morgan might go into actual meltdown (not all bad then). I met Idris Elba a few years back and had a bloody good conversation with him. I was very drunk, he was very nice and very patient. When I mentioned the Bond role, casually suggesting I thought he'd have been rather good he changed immediately, very defensive - snapped at me “what because I'm black”. After de-ruffling his magnificent plumage with heartfelt opinions on his acting chops he returned to being entirely charming and convivial, and bloody huge. It became quite clear it was a far more sensitive issue to him than me. It seems the issue with race, is that race is still an issue"

A subversive tightrope walker? An underachiever? An overachiever? A wry political commentator? Or an unlikely combination of all of the above? No less pertinent, is Costello past his prime — as was painfully suggested by his very craggy opening songs, “Mystery Dance,” “Miracle Man” and “Watching The Detectives?” Or is this 70-year-old troubadour still able to strike aural gold? Happily, he did just that during his four concluding songs, “Pump It Up,” “(I Don't Want To Go To) Chelsea,” “Radio, Radio” and the Nick Lowe-penned “(What's So Funny 'Bout) Peace, Love And Understanding?” These are key questions posed during Costello's 22-song performance Tuesday with his superb, four-man band, The Imposters. The answers, much as at his similarly haphazard 2022 San Diego show at The Shell, are mostly affirmative. If that seems like a contradiction, well, so is Costello, whose current “Radio Soul! The Early Songs of Elvis Costello” tour focuses on songs off the nine albums he made with his previous band, The Attractions, from 1977's “My Aim Is True” to 1986's “Blood & Chocolate.” A 2003 Rock & Roll Hall of Fame inductee, he boasts one of the richest and most diverse songbooks in pop music history. He also has an unwavering determination to follow his muse anywhere it leads him, no matter how much doing so has alienated some fans who embraced his impassioned music in the late 1970s. That determination is to his credit. Costello is the only artist anywhere who has made full albums with Burt Bacharach, a string quartet, a jazz big band, the London Symphony Orchestra, New Orleans music legend Allen Toussaint, leading hip-hop group The Roots and Swedish mezzo-soprano Anne Sofie von Otter. His tireless inquisitiveness and constant quest to explore new artistic vistas are all worth cheering. Alas, Costello has — over the past decade or so — also become one of the most inconsistent performers in any idiom, at least when it comes to his increasingly strained and erratic singing voice. That can make his wildly uneven concerts a sonic roller coaster of dizzying highs and wince-inducing lows. Accordingly, his Tuesday show at Humphreys hit both extremes. For most of his first 10 songs, Costello's singing was ragged and hoarse. Notes that once came easily eluded him altogether. His pitch wavered so much that he periodically sounded like a bleating barroom drunk. Even when he recited the lyrics to “Watching The Detectives,” rather than sing them, Costello struggled to stay in key. Even so, he seemed engaged and bantered easily with the equally engaged audience. But his voice repeatedly let him down and did a major disservice to his exceptionally well-crafted songs, which on Tuesday included such rarely heard gems as “Clubland” and “Strict Time.” Mercifully, nearly an hour into his performance, the musical alchemy began. The turning point came with Costello's 11th selection, “Deportee,” a stripped-down, reinvention of his 1984 song, “The Deportees Club,” performed anew in a low-key, semi-unplugged setting. Trading his electric guitar for an acoustic one, Costello still sounded raspy. But the roughness of his voice lent added pathos to “Deportees' ” stark lyrics about ill-fated immigrants confronting harsh realities in the United States. His singing improved markedly with the next four selections, which Costello also performed on acoustic guitar. Perhaps because of the lower volume and his dogged perseverance, Costello suddenly found his voice on an ingenious mash-up of his 1978 song “Living In Paradise” and Van Morrison's 1970 hit, “Domino.” The two were combined, he told the cheering audience, “to show you where I stole ('Paradise') from.” Costello scored equally well with his understated, achingly slow version of “(The Angels Wanna Wear My) Red Shoes,” and a terrific, salsa-music-tinged take on “Clubland” (which deftly incorporated The Specials' 1981 song, “Ghost Town”). His impeccable band provided finely calibrated accompaniment, with Pete Thomas playing brushes on a small stand-up drum kit and Davey Faragher switching to an upright electric bass. Keyboardist Steve Nieve — who, like Thomas, was a member of Costello's first band of note, The Attractions — added dazzling piano and organ punctuations without ever detracting from the music at hand. Guitarist Charlie Sexton only soloed a few times, but made his presence felt when he did. His six-string played added depth and texture to songs that Costello had originally done with just one guitar, and the band played with an admirable combination of fire and finesse throughout. Costello and The Imposters returned to full-on electric mode with “Everyday I Write The Book,” skillfully recast as a 1960s R&B song. Seven more songs followed, including “Wonder Woman” and the crowd-pleasing “Alison.” Costello sometimes strained and sang a few bum notes. But he sounded largely revitalized, as he snatched victory from the jaws of defeat, transforming what began as a disappointing concert into an improbable triumph. Although he never mentioned President Donald Trump by name, Costello made several biting references to him on stage. In one instance he did so, simply by invoking the titles of some of his vintage songs, most notably “Waiting for the End of the World,” These sentiments were reinforced by the recordings that immediately preceded and followed the concert, Heaven 17's 1981 song, “(We Don't Need This) Fascist Groove Thang” and Mandy Miller's perky 1956 song, “Nellie The Elephant” (with its refrain of “Off she went with a trumpety-trump/ Trump, trump, trump”)."

This K-beauty product (formulated with soothing heartleaf extract) is perfect for anyone looking to double cleanse, and it'll glide on your face so smoothly. Promising review: ""My skin is *super* sensitive, but as I've aged (44 years), I feel like my pores have become more visible. I hadn't used an oil cleanser before and wasn't 100% sure how it should all work. The Anua oil cleanser works how we all once hoped Biore pore strips would work back in the day but without any pain or irritation. My skin is combination skin, so I have to be really careful about not drying out the dry spots (and getting eczema) and not over-hydrating the oily spots (and getting a breakout). I rub the oil on my face as the first part of my cleansing routine; I massage it in for ~60 seconds and then put a small amount of water on my fingers and begin rubbing that on my face. The water starts the emulsification process and helps to clean out everything the oil has bonded to/mixed with. Then, I just rinse it clean and use a gentle cleanser afterward. I haven't had any irritation, redness, or fallout from adding this product to my skincare routine. I love it. I am almost through my first bottle and if I go a few days without using the cleanser, my pores become more visible/dirty again. I will definitely keep purchasing the Anua oil cleanser."" —Tassa Get it from Amazon for $17.69. 4.

The winning PSAs will be displayed in New York City on June 27 on a digital billboard in Times Square, with space donated by Clear Channel Outdoor. Founded in 2007, Project Yellow Light commemorates Hunter Garner, who died in a car crash at age 16. According to the latest data, 3,275 people were killed and an estimated 324,819 were injured in crashes involving distracted drivers in 2023. Distraction affected 8% of fatal crashes, 13% of injury crashes and 13% of all police-reported crashes that year. This year's scholarships are sponsored by Clear Channel Outdoor and Elephant Insurance, with partnering support from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), iHeartMedia, National 4-H Council and PIX 11. This year, the contest received 2,728 submissions from students across all 50 states and Washington, D.C. The 2025 scholarship prizes were awarded to: They Have 9 (billboard design, college): Jaiden Mehta (Southlake, TX) Oh Deer (billboard design, high school): Iliana Perry (Gilmer, TX) Typewriter (radio, college): Levi Bridge (Layton, UT) Nine Lives (radio, high school): Ben Michaels (Belmont, CA) Pavlov's Distraction (video, college): Matilda Isobel (Wellington, FL) Gamble (video, high school): Victoria Pham (Irvine, CA) This year's entries were judged by a variety of advertising industry executives and artists who lent their time to support this scholarship competition. The panel for this year included recording artist and songwriter Aloe Blacc; renowned filmmaker and social activist Kweku Mandela; Wendy Clark, Partner at The Consello Group; Co-Chairman and Partner of Goodby Silverstein & Partners Jeff Goodby; award-winning poet, songwriter, and author IN-Q; and representatives from The Martin Agency and additional Project Yellow Light partners. Since 2012, the Ad Council and NHTSA have collaborated to increase awareness regarding the dangers associated with distracted driving. The support for the Project Yellow Light Scholarship competition extends these efforts as part of the broader Distracted Driving Prevention Campaign. KEY QUOTES ""As a mother who has tragically lost a child in a car crash, I understand the devastating impact of distracted driving. We often believe it won't happen to us, but it can, and it does. I am deeply grateful to our 2025 winners, all participants and our partners for their unwavering support in promoting our mission to raise awareness about the dangers of distracted driving."" “Project Yellow Light harnesses the creativity of our nation's young people to convey a critical, lifesaving message: Distracted driving is deadly,” said NHTSA Chief Counsel Peter Simshauser. “These advertisements speak directly and authentically to teen and college-aged drivers, and NHTSA applauds these creators for using their talents to help save lives.” ""The creativity and dedication demonstrated by this year's scholarship winners are truly inspiring. Their impactful PSAs not only highlight the dangers of distracted driving but also showcase the power of peer-to-peer messaging in saving lives,” said Michelle Hillman, Ad Council chief campaign development officer. “We are thrilled to celebrate their achievements and support their efforts in making our roads safer for everyone."" “After a decade of supporting Project Yellow Light, we continue to be inspired by these talented students who are using their creativity to steer the conversation around distracted driving and influence safer road behaviors,” said Dan Levi, EVP & CMO, Clear Channel Outdoor. “Their ability to connect with their peers through messaging that truly resonates underscores the critical role young people play in combating distracted driving.

mov_0FC305692DE6BB224F62A1C643C1A0E3,2025-06-27 17:32:37,en,WEB,"  “What you see is what you know, and all I ever saw growing up was women cooking. My parents were very against the idea of it becoming my career. My family doesn't drink or eat pork, and they worried I wouldn't be able to avoid those things in a professional kitchen. When it was time to go to college, I started out studying finance at Baruch College, but I landed an internship at Time Inc. during my freshman year. From there, every internship I had was in fashion, beauty, or media. Halfway through college, I realized I didn't have the experience—or interest—for a finance job, so I created an ad hoc major that blended communications, marketing, and journalism, with a minor in art. My first job out of school was at BuzzFeed. By then, I'd already started posting food videos on TikTok and was gaining some traction. BuzzFeed had a talent incubator program where you could create content, and after two months there, Bon Appétit food director Chris Morocco emailed me about an assistant food editor position that was opening up. I interviewed and got the job. Less than six months into Bon Appétit, I signed with a manager. I was feeling overwhelmed by influencer work, which had become a real—and lucrative—part of my life, and I didn't want to give it up. Pretty quickly, my team asked if I had any interest in doing a cookbook. I initially said no—it felt too soon—but they encouraged me to think it over. I did, and the book, Third Culture Cooking: Classic Recipes for a New Generation, took more than two years to make. If you're the child of immigrants—or come from a family that recently immigrated—the term third culture kid really resonates. For a long time, I couldn't make sense of the tension of being from two places. Both of my parents are of Indian descent, my grandma came from a farming family in East Africa, and I was raised in New Jersey. That in-between space is real, but different, and there's no blueprint for how to exist in it. So when I first heard the term, I felt an immediate sense of peace. It was like, Oh—I don't have to pick. I exist here. And that's enough. My cooking is third culture cooking. I'm not exclusively doing American classics, and I'm not strictly recreating my grandmother's recipes either. A term like fusion might sound similar, but it feels hollow and it lacks context. Third culture cooking has layers—there's history, storytelling, and meaning. BEAUTY I feel uniquely lucky to have always been surrounded by women. My mom is a hairdresser and aesthetician by trade, and I have two sisters. Seeing them interact with beauty made me feel like This is what girls do. This is a part of girlhood. Also, the idea of getting ready has always been part of my life. As someone who wears a scarf, there are a few steps before you head out the door—I have to put my scarf on, and if I'm doing that, I might as well put on some lip gloss. One of my sisters wears a scarf too, so she's my go-to for hair stuff because she's in the know. My other sister and I talk about skincare constantly, because when you're framing your face with a scarf, your skin is everything because that's all people see. SKINCARE The Drunk Elephant line was truly revelatory for me. I was maybe 18 when I discovered it, and a few of their products completely changed my skin. Their Beste cleanser is super soft on my skin—it's what I travel with because it removes anything left after my first cleanse with Sulwhasoo's cleansing oil. I also like the Youth To The People's and Kiehl's Ultra Facial cleansers. And if I want gentle physical exfoliation, Humanrace's Rice Powder is my go-to. My skin always looks smooth afterward, and makeup goes on beautifully. Another game-changer: I bought a 15-pack of washcloths and switch them out every night. For chemical exfoliation, I tone with Ren's Ready Steady tonic, usually in place of my Drunk Elephant T.L.C. Framboos serum, which has glycolic acid. And I've been using Tower 28's SOS spray for over a year—I can't travel without it. It has hypochlorous acid and helps calm my skin and reduce hormonal breakouts. And TikTok convinced me to try Beauty of Joseon's Revive eye serum, and I swear my eyes look brighter since I started using it. During the day, I like Drunk Elephant's C-Firma serum. I've tried the vitamin C from Skinceuticals, but like everyone says, it smells like hot dog water and was too much for me...."

1lod7a7,2025-06-30 17:12:11,en,REDDIT,"  Hi. Not sure if this is a good place to go for this, but worth a shot. Also not sure why ages/gender were necessary but there they are! Background(TW: depression, SH): many years ago (way before I met my husband) I was at rock bottom. Depressed, isolated, no desire to exist. I had decided I was done. I bought $300 worth of booze, booked a hotel room in the city, and began my exit. The morning I didn't expect to wake up, I woke up to a call from someone I didn't know. Let's call him Travis. He said he had a group call with some friends from online the night before and I had just showed up, drunk as a skunk. He said he talked me out of my plan and hoped I was still feeling talked out of it. We talked the rest of the day, and I “met” his online friends in the days to come. Found a little community of random people from across the country, and it kept me going. I even started dating one of them (not Travis), though he turned out to be awful. . but not the point of the story. Travis was my best friend. He'd come visit me, talk to me about my problems, and I'd listen to his. We each dated a couple of people in that time, all of whom did not like our friendship. Fair enough. But we were very open with each other and knew we were not romantically compatible. It's not like that elephant in the room had never been addressed. We had different life goals, and to be frank, weren't physically attracted to each other. We are both considered “conventionally attractive” but just not each other's physical preferences. But we got really emotionally codependent for a while. At its peak, we had AirPods in nearly 24 hours a day while at work, running errands, etc. just listening to each other live our lives. And then our codependency reached its natural breaking point, and we slept together. We both knew we shouldn't and that it would forever change the friendship, and I regret it so much, but it happened. We realized we had become too dependent and tried taking a few steps back. We drifted apart while we tried to sort out our independence and priorities. Then I met my now husband. How about David. David is perfect (for me). He makes me feel things I've never felt before, and allows me to be the truest version of myself. I have never been happier than when I am with him. He is supportive and brilliant and patient and full. We had the same vision of life and the future, and gosh darn it if he isn't the most beautiful sight in the world to me. He is the love of my life, without a doubt. When David and I got serious, we had an open conversation about boundaries. We both felt that exes had no place in our lives. I told him about what had happened with Travis. David said that counted as an ex to him. I said we were never in a romantic relationship. We were always just friends and made a mistake. But he said he was uncomfortable and I certainly can't blame him. So I reached out to Travis and let him know that the time had come. It wasn't appropriate to be friends anymore. It's been a few years since then. David and I got married, moved to our dream city, and are trying for a baby. Travis texted me out of the blue last week, wishing me well in my life and marriage, apologizing for not reaching out all these years...."

Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""I loved this setting powder, it blurred my pores and blended my makeup so well that even my husband noticed. Wow! I will be buying more before people find it and sell it all out, hehehe."" —Charlotte Laim Get it from Amazon for $25. 3.

Removes shine and gives a soft-focus effect to the makeup. Perfect for when you've been busy and your makeup is a little shiny in places. Doesn't change the color or texture of the makeup either or risk spilling or cracking like powder. A+"" —TheWildSide Get it from Amazon for $8. 4. A hair identifier spray because if dermaplaning has become an essential step in your routine, this stuff is about to change the game.

Once you spray in any direction that has hair, it automatically identifies the hair that needs to be removed. It is easily sprayed on and easily wiped off. No extra residue. Comes with four blades, and I say these blades are soft and gentle yet get the job done. Not sure why no one ever thought of coming up with a hair identifier spray. Great value and smells like baby powder. Great quality."" —Karine Get it from Amazon for $8.99 (also available in multipacks). 5. Sol De Janeiro's Delicia Drench Body Butter that'll shower you with fast-absorbing moisture that lasts all day long while working to improve your skin barrier.

n0vyvex,2025-07-02 04:23:47,en,REDDIT,"  You got to be quick but in the last week I've gotten Drunk Elephant, Summer Fridays and Lancôme. Those are name brand items and I'm only silver."
mov_4E84BFB5343D9C7FC77850B6F7B1CCC3,2025-07-02 19:15:13,en,WEB,"  A dedicated real ale enthusiast, who has embarked on the world's longest pub crawl for more than 40 years, has marked his 24,000th pub visit. Peter Hill celebrated his 69th birthday with a pint at the Elephant & Castle in Dudley, West Midlands, reaching this impressive milestone on June 20. His extraordinary pub crawl has seen him traverse 400,000 miles and down an astonishing 60,000 pints since he first started in 1984, when a pint was a mere 64p. Peter and his mates, known as the Black Country Ale Tairsters, began their unique journey of visiting different pubs after growing tired of frequenting the same local. Since then, Peter has made it into the record books by scouring the country far and wide, averaging 11 pub visits every week with the goal of ticking off every pub listed in the CAMRA guide. Committed Peter has accomplished the feat of having a drink in every pub in Wales, enjoying a pint on 69 islands around the UK, and popping into a pub in every British county. The father-of-two, from West Bromwich, shared: ""It's been a great adventure and I've met some amazing people along the way. I'm not sure if I'll ever stop, as I still really enjoy it. There's still hundreds of pubs to go, so I'll keep on going while I can."" He added: ""There's a little group of us who go, the numbers have gone up and down as people have got married, sometimes I just go by myself. We used to get a little drunk in the early days but it's more of a mature hobby now and I always take it easy and pace myself."" The group was established 41 years ago with the aim of visiting all 300 pubs listed on a map distributed by the local Banks's Brewery in Wolverhampton. After ticking off every single one, they decided to keep going, embarking on increasingly ambitious challenges to raise funds for charity. One room of his house is now crammed with 280 lever-arch files documenting each pub visit, complete with photos, menus and other keepsakes from his journeys. Retired engineer Peter, who is married to Dawn, 66, reminisced: ""We started back in November 1984 with a group of mates and my dad when the price of a pint was just 64p. We just got a bit bored of going to the same old place and it was my dad's idea to start visiting 300 from a Banks's map of Wolverhampton pubs. Then we sort of said 'shall we get to 1,000?' Then it was 2,000, then 3,000 and it just never stopped from there. ""We set a world record for the longest pub crawl but it was never about that. I'm just enjoying my life while trying to raise a bit of money for charity. ""I have raised over £35,000 for good causes over the years, I only ask for a quid a pub really but some landlords give more. We like to raise money for the local children's hospital wherever we are and also for the Air Ambulance. ""We have seen the industry drastically change over the years. It's sad to see so many pubs struggling, the price of the beer doesn't help – you can pay £7 a pint and even over a tenner for some of these fancy craft ales. ""But I don't go for them. My favourites are Oakham Cistra, Abbeydale Moonshine or Deception, Ossett White Rat and Black Country Ales. ""We've been to the Shetlands, Orkneys, Jersey, Guernsey. And to parts of Europe too as we like to visit military and war sites, like the Somme. ""I always leave a calling card which I have signed by a pub team member to prove I have been in. The wife is OK with it, she just accepts it's my hobby. It's our anniversary next week and she wants to go to Greenwich. ""So of course, I've checked if there's a few pubs I need to chalk off down there and there is, so we'll be popping for couple of pints. ""I'm trying to do my bit to keep the pub scene alive. I'll keep going until the beer runs out.""

不同族群的手部保養需求不相同，有些重視高效滋潤，有些重視吸收不黏膩，也有些將護手霜當香氛享受，究竟該怎麼挑？ 1.熟齡、極乾燥雙手
年齡增長、乾性膚質或在冬季較寒冷時，會讓雙手容易乾燥、長細紋，甚至脫皮。 適合選擇高油脂含量，例如乳油木果脂、蜂蠟、植物油(橄欖油、甜杏仁油、摩洛哥堅果油等等)，搭配密集修護配方，幫助滋潤並鞏固肌膚屏障。 延伸閱讀：

2.主婦
常接觸洗碗精與清潔劑的主婦族群，手部易乾裂受損。 建議選擇有修護成份，質地偏潤的護手霜，例如甘油、泛醇(維他命B5)等等，最好還能形成保護膜，能在肌表加強防護，減少清潔時水分流失。 3.上班族
需要長時間打電腦或使用手機的上班族，最怕護手霜過於油膩。 選擇輕盈快吸型質地最實用，可含玻尿酸、積雪草萃取，兼顧清爽與修護。 4.香氛控
喜愛將護手霜當作日常香氛的人，可挑選出自香氛品牌，延伸自香水的款式，擦上彷彿補香一樣，自帶迷人香氣。 5.富貴手
這類型的手部肌膚容易乾癢、脫皮甚至龜裂出血，建議選擇無香料、低敏溫和配方且有修護力的護手霜，像包括：神經醯胺、泛醇(維他命B5)、燕麥萃取等成份。 護手霜塗抹技巧
擦護手霜時可別隨便擦擦，搭配按摩可以幫助吸收，打造更柔嫩細緻的美手。 1.先手背後手心
先將護手霜擠在手背，用另一手手背推開，避免手心一開始就過於滑膩，影響後續按摩。 2.螺旋按摩
以指腹畫小圓方式，從手背往手心輕柔按摩，促進吸收。 3.指縫與關節別忽略
特別針對指節、指縫等細節處，以拇指輕壓揉按，不錯過任何一個死角。 4.指緣護理
加強按摩指緣與甲床周圍，避免乾裂倒刺，幫助指甲邊緣維持柔嫩狀態。 5.帶到手腕
最後可順勢將護手霜帶到手腕，讓整隻手都細緻滑順。 使用護手霜的最佳時機
護手霜的正確使用方式，針對不同時機，用量與塗抹技巧也不盡相同。 1.早晚固定保養，形成護手習慣
早晨出門前塗抹，為雙手建立一層保護膜，減少白天外界刺激。 晚間睡前是修護黃金期，可使用較滋養的護手霜，搭配按摩加強吸收，有需要時可戴上棉質手套，隔天醒來雙手更柔嫩。 2.洗手後、接觸水分後記得補擦
每次洗手、洗碗或酒精清潔後，手部皮脂膜容易被破壞，既可馬上補擦護手霜，維持保濕屏障。 若環境乾燥(如在冷氣房或是冬天時)，可依需要每2～3小時重複塗抹，預防乾燥。 3.用量可視膚況與護手霜質地調整
日間保養或辦公室使用，使用約5元硬幣大小用量即可，避免手感油膩影響工作。 晚上可加量至10元硬幣大小，並延伸至手腕、指緣，仔細按摩吸收。 2025 20款護手霜推薦：滋潤不黏膩的人氣選擇

mov_BDCCA934835671558CC8C7A1FB88AC86,2025-07-03 20:34:03,en,WEB,"  In 1979 Nez released Infinite Rider, his ninth post-Monkees studio album and the third studio album from his own company, Pacific Arts . In 1981, while still releasing records and albums, Nez presented Elephant Parts, the first long-form music video ever and Kathryn was the producer. He pulled together friends to help pitch in and shoot the segments. They took an old mechanic's garage and converted it into a makeshift sound stage. Elephant Parts is one-hour-long with comedy sketches, and comic promos for his albums Infinite Rider on the Big Dogma and Live at the Palais it also features five full-length music videos . Executive Producer Michael Nesmith     Written by Michael Nesmith, William Dear and Bill Martin. Directed by William Dear. Produced by Kathryn Nesmith     additional material by Nancy Gregory (choreographer )      The title Elephant Parts refers to the parable of the blind man and an elephant where each man comes to a different conclusion about what an elephant is due to them touching only one part of the animal. The Grammys had to create a new category for videos in the '80's . and Nez was the first to be awarded one . ""On the 24th February at the 1982 Grammy Awards, Michael Nesmith (USA) won Video of the Year for Elephant Parts (Pacific Arts, 1981), an hour-long collection of music videos and comedy sketches directed by William Dear. The release, described as the ""first commercial video record"", featured songs written and performed by the ex-Monkees vocalist/guitarist."" Billboard's review said it was ""the cleverest exercise in original video programming to date. Throughout Elephant Parts, Nez makes fun of his own works, with segments including a parody of his song ""Joanne"" called ""Rodan"". The parody of the 1970 song, It was inspired by a joke John Seiter told Nez in 1972: ""Did you ever hear the foreign version of it? Her name was Rodanne. She lived in a meadow by Japan. ""          ''Magic''. This song is on the '' Infinite Rider on the Big Dogma'' album of 1992 ( subtitled This Night is Magic ) Some Nez notes on the video - Nez plays two roles in this one. At 0.13 is the visual pun pair of dice = paradise. As the car takes off, the starry night background is actually black kraft paper with holes cut in it. For the kiss at 1.22 Nez has the actress ( Lark Alcott ) kiss to the side of his mouth so her face is not obscured. This is a something Nez discovered from watching Clark Gable movies ! His dance partner at 2.20 is Nancy Gregory. He said the dance routine where he drops her was ''sort of made up as we went along''. At 2.44 the car is followed by Nezs Honda bike ( blink and you miss it ! ) The air plane was filmed at Monterey airport, the scene inspired by the classic movie ''Casablanca''. To save money, at 3.10, they paid for only one engine to be started up so the propeller can be seen. The final scene with them fading into the distance was filmed in front of a green screen. The Tragically Hip formed in 1983 at Queen's University, named after a sketch in ""Elephant Parts,"" ""The Tragically Hip"" (which was the inspiration for the Canadian band The Tragically Hip ) and was featured as a pre taped sketch on a season six episode of Saturday Night Live . Nez appears several times in comedy shorts as a lounge singer, with slicked back hair. “ You Must Remember This.” ,“ Funny” and “Dancing In The Dark.” “ Cruisin' ''. The song was released in 1979 as a single on the Pacific Arts label and was also on the Infinite Rider album. It stars Steve Strong as Sam , a wrestler and occasional actor ( Real name Stephen Cepello ) Some girls from the set saw him in a bar and asked him to take part in the video. The two girls were seen dancing at a roller disco and offered parts. When Nez was taking the completed video around to TV stations some execs were confused by the opening scenes with the red speedos and thought it was a porno film ! At 0.10 the background behind Nez is made of black garbage bags stapled to the wall with lights and a fan on them for the effect. Lucy and Ramona are filmed mainly in the streets of Los Angeles skating in front of many well known landmarks, including the Tower Records building. How many others can you recognise ? Nez plays a cameo roll at 2.07 as a drunk in the alley. The scene tracking the bus behind the two girls at 2.53 seems set up but was actually just serendipitous. In the final scenes of Nez in black in front of the ubiquitous garbage bags ( 3.06) two assistants are squirting him with water, eventually soaking him ! Nez then dives out of shot, takes a mouthful of water and spits !          "" Neighbourhood Nuclear Superiority"" is a favourite with many fans. The two boys who featured in it were Jonathan Nesmith and William Dear's son, Oliver . The girl is Heather Dear.         "" Flying Lessons"". Nez's own plane was used in the background of the shots taken at Monterey airport and he wrote the comment in FB on 14 sept 2017     “OK...."

An exquisite tinted lip balm shockingly similar to Clinique's ""Black Honey"" but it doesn't cost nearly as much. This weightless, non-sticky formula glides onto your pout to give 'em a subtle polished tint of your choosing. Soon you'll be smackin' your lips all over the place, and no one can blame you when they look this good. ♀ My colleague Emma Lord can vouch for this: ""I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference!"" Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a pink honey version, individually, and as a two-pack that includes both!) . 2. Catrice ""Instant Awake"" Under Eye Brightener — it'll help liven up your tired eyes with a lightweight formula that delivers superb coverage in just a few swipes. This tinted concealer contains hyaluronic acid and shea butter that may also help reduce dark circles over time. It's just like the $33 Becca version but for MUCH less. Promising reviews: ""Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it."" —Placeholder ""I ran across this when looking to replace my $33 Becca under-eye brightening cream, and since money is tight, I took a chance. Very surprised to find this product to be comparable in coverage and staying power, and superior in moisture. Highly recommend!"" —Nancy Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades). 3. A TikTok-beloved ""Soft"" perfume rollerball reviewers can't stop raving about, with some even comparing it to lemon pound cake. YUM! This is gonna be a real treat for your senses *and* it rolls on nice and easy. It's basically a budget-friendly version of Pink Sugar, which goes for $65. Promising review: ""It's definitely a [swap] for Pink Sugar, only better. To me, Pink Sugar has changed and now dries down to a too-forward pepper smell that overpowers the sugar. This doesn't do that, it's exactly like Pink Sugar when it first goes on with sweet and powdery scent profiles, and remains that way after dry down...on me, this is what I'm getting anyway. It lasts and lasts too like a quality oil perfume should."" —Criss Get it from Amazon for $4.50. 4. A lash-extending E.l.f. Cosmetics tubing mascara because your lashes deserve the best and you don't wanna waste your time with dry, clumpy (pricey) formulas. This one is perfect for thin, delicate lashes and is similar to Thrive. The lightweight tubing technology wraps around your eyelashes for a smudge-proof lift that looks natural. Plus, it's super easy to take off at the end of the day without tons of harsh scrubbing. Check out a TikTok of the E.l.f. mascara in action...."

[Learn more] Amazon's big Prime Day sale doesn't start until tomorrow (Tuesday) but they've launched some great deals already. There's 63% off Olay's luxurious whipped moisturiser that leaves skin 'feeling fresh' and has a 'gorgeous scent'. The Olay Regenerist Whip Day Face Cream is usually £38 but it's down to just £14. The whipped moisturiser transforms from cream to liquid on contact and is quickly absorbed, giving a smooth matte finish without clogging pores. The lightweight, non-greasy cream acts as a 2-in-1 primer and moisturiser, ready for make-up. Enriched with vitamin B3, it helps promote skin cell renewal and reduce fine lines and wrinkles – and also provides SPF30 protection. MORE AMAZON DEALS One reviewer wrote: “I have always used various Olay products all my adult life and I'm in my 60s. This particular one is very creamy but sinks into the skin quickly and feels light. It has a touch of luxury when using it and lasts well.” Whipped face products have become a popular beauty trend in recent years. Drunk Elephant's Lala Retro Whipped Cream delivers intense hydration and costs £58, while Bondi Sands' Daydream Whipped Moisturiser is on offer at LookFantastic for £7.49. However, the Regenerist Whip Day Face Cream gets an overall rating of 4.5 stars from more than 2,800 Amazon customers. One said: ""I usually always use Olay and thought I would try this whip one, well I'm glad I did - its got the most gorgeous scent to it and I love it, also makes my skin look and feel better."" Another said: ""Absolutely love this. It's really lightweight but soaks in to the skin well without feeling oily and leaves my skin feeling fresh but not shiny. I have also noticed a better look to the laughter lines around my eyes!"" A third added: ""This whip version with a high SPF is perfect for day wear. I have been tempted to pay a fortune for other hyped skin care, believing they would be better. Not a chance, I stick with Regenerist and my skin looks lovely."" Some felt it was a little too expensive when not on offer, saying: ""Bit pricey considering it is whip, meaning there is slightly less actual product than original."" But that's why the current 63% discount is a great chance to try it out. Amazon will be announcing even more discounts come Tuesday, July 8 when Prime Day kicks off – and, despite the name, the event runs until July 11. ""With four full days to shop, Prime members have more time than ever to explore and save,"" Amazon said.

Ma ti sei mai chiesto se tutti questi prodotti che promettono risultati straordinari riescano davvero a mantenere le loro promesse? In questo articolo, andremo a scoprire alcune delle novità più interessanti nel mercato della bellezza, analizzando le loro caratteristiche, gli ingredienti e il potenziale impatto sulla tua routine di bellezza quotidiana. Dai sieri innovativi ai primer multifunzionali, vedremo come questi prodotti si distinguono nella folla e quali metriche possono guidare le nostre scelte. Le ultime innovazioni nei sieri e nei primer I dati ci raccontano una storia interessante riguardo ai sieri e ai primer che stanno conquistando il mercato. Prendiamo ad esempio il nuovo siero di Drunk Elephant, un prodotto che promette di regalare una pelle radiosa e ben idratata. Questo siero ha dimostrato, in uno studio clinico, un incremento immediato dell'idratazione della pelle del 115%: un risultato che ha catturato l'attenzione degli esperti del settore. La leggerezza della formulazione e la sua capacità di migliorare l'elasticità e la fermezza della pelle lo rendono un candidato ideale per chi cerca risultati tangibili. Sei curioso di sapere se può fare la differenza nella tua routine? Non possiamo dimenticare il primer di Anastasia Beverly Hills, arricchito con SPF, che rappresenta un altro esempio di come i marchi stiano rispondendo alle esigenze dei consumatori. Con l'84% di ingredienti dedicati alla cura della pelle, questo prodotto non solo protegge dai raggi UV, ma offre anche un'idratazione duratura. Ingredienti come niacinamide e glicerina contribuiscono a ottenere una pelle liscia e levigata; due fattori cruciali per un primer di successo. Hai mai pensato a quanto sia importante la protezione solare nella tua routine di bellezza? Case study: l'approccio di Deborah Pagani Nella mia esperienza in Google, ho imparato che il successo di un prodotto dipende non solo dalla sua qualità, ma anche dalla narrazione che lo circonda. Un ottimo esempio è Deborah Pagani, ex colorista di celebrità e ora fondatrice di un marchio di lusso. Ha lanciato un siero per capelli che combina ingredienti di alta qualità come acido ialuronico e squalano. Questo prodotto non solo idrata e ripara, ma offre anche un profumo distintivo, frutto della collaborazione con un noto profumiere. Pagani ha dichiarato di voler rompere gli standard di settore, puntando su ingredienti puliti e risultati efficaci. Non è interessante vedere come una strategia di marketing ben definita possa supportare un prodotto di bellezza? Analizzando le metriche di performance, è evidente che la popolarità del siero di Pagani è in crescita, grazie anche alla sua capacità di creare un'esperienza di lusso per il consumatore. I feedback sono stati positivi, evidenziando l'efficacia e la qualità degli ingredienti. E tu, cosa cerchi in un prodotto per capelli? Strategie di implementazione e KPI da monitorare Se desideri implementare strategie simili nel marketing dei prodotti di bellezza, è fondamentale concentrarsi su alcuni KPI chiave. Tra questi, il tasso di conversione (CTR), il ritorno sulla spesa pubblicitaria (ROAS) e il modello di attribuzione sono metriche essenziali che possono fornire informazioni dettagliate sulla performance delle campagne. Monitorare questi KPI permette di ottimizzare le strategie di marketing e di adattarsi rapidamente alle esigenze del mercato. Ti sei mai chiesto quanto un buon monitoraggio possa influenzare il successo delle tue campagne? Inoltre, avere una visione chiara del customer journey è cruciale: comprendere le fasi che un consumatore attraversa, dalla consapevolezza all'acquisto, consente di personalizzare le offerte e migliorare l'esperienza del cliente. Utilizzare strumenti di analisi come Google Analytics può aiutare a raccogliere dati preziosi per prendere decisioni informate e guidare le strategie di marketing. Sei pronto a scoprire come ottimizzare il tuo approccio al mercato della bellezza? In conclusione, il settore della bellezza è in continua trasformazione e la chiave del successo risiede nella combinazione di innovazione, analisi dati e comprensione profonda delle esigenze dei consumatori. Con un'attenzione particolare ai KPI e una narrativa avvincente, i marchi possono emergere in un mercato competitivo e soddisfare le aspettative dei consumatori moderni. Non è affascinante come la scienza e la creatività possano unirsi per creare prodotti davvero straordinari? “`"

Learn more Creating the perfect summer skin is all about two things; hydration and glow. We all want a base that feels lightweight, comfortable and easy to wear whilst still giving us some added radiance, which is why we're loving this clever skincare hack that Zara McDermott shared on her Instagram recently. Zara used only two products to create the look; the L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion and the L'Oréal Paris Revitalift Filler Replumping Water Cream, and although Zara herself is an ambassador for the brand, she revealed she'd spotted the hack going viral elsewhere and had to try it out for herself. If you're keen to copy her look, now is the ideal time as both products have landed in the Amazon Prime Day sale, with the Glotion slashed from £12.79 to £8.99, whilst the Replumping Water Cream has a huge 54% saving, taking it from £29.99 to £13.79. READ MORE: Millie Mackintosh shares her makeup hack to get a '10 second facelift' READ MORE: Frankie Bridge's go-to IPL hair removal device now has £500 off in flash sale Whilst it's obviously nothing groundbreaking to be wearing a moisturiser and a glow enhancer, the two can often be tricky to pair together, with some glow serums not sitting well over the top of your moisturiser. However Zara's hack involves blending the two hydrating products together, which avoids separation and patchiness that can happen when you try to layer them. That's why the L'Oréal Paris Replumping Water Cream is the perfect pick for this technique, as it has a non-greasy finish, not to mention a handy press down top which lets you mix the two together on top of the moisturiser, creating minimal waste. Zara showed how quick and easy it was to do, by pumping some moisturiser into the top of the pot before adding a healthy squeeze of the L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion and mixing it together with her finger. She then applied it directly onto her face using just her fingers to blend it all together, before sharing her amazement at the results. Zara's face had an instantly smoother look and a more radiant glow, whilst still looking like she was wearing nothing at all, giving her skin the perfect natural glow for summer.

E.l.f.'s Hydrating Core Lip Shine in the ""Ecstatic"" shade, which reviewers say captures the some magic as ""Black Honey,"" the $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique that's blowing up on TikTok at a fraction of the price. It doesn't shift colors as magically as the other version, but it's a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lip. I personally will live, breathe, and die by the magic of $25 ""universal"" Black Honey version — it lasts FOREVER and also functions as the perfect blush — but it sells out so often that I am also deeply relieved to know it has a cheap alternative in case of lip emergency! Promising review: ""I absolutely love this product. The dark color is perfectly sheer. It also adds the most beautiful color to your lips. I am a Clinique Black Honey lip fan, and this gives me the same look for a fraction of the cost. I love it and have multiple that I keep in various spots. Not sticky either, which is my biggest gripe about lip glosses. My hair doesn't get stuck in this like some glosses, but I get the shine."" —Hamps5 Get it from Amazon for $6 (also available in four other shades). 2. A set of square stemmed wineglasses inspired by the iconic Crate & Barrel version, except these are durable as heck (good for particularly rowdy wine-and-cheese nights). Reviewers especially love these chic, understated glasses because they work well for red and white wines. Promising review: ""We've had four of these glasses for over six months now and finally just added four more to our collection. These glasses are SO CHIC and are very similar to ones sold at Crate & Barrel but are MUCH more durable. Unlike the C&B glasses, you can cheers without feeling like the glasses will break. In fact, they've tipped over in the sink a few times and are still intact. They dry beautifully, sparkle after the dishwasher and we get so many compliments on them. I love them!"" —Katie B Get a set of two from Amazon for $27.99. 3. L'Oréal Paris Makeup True Match Lumi Glotion designed to enhance your skin's natural ✨ glow✨ just like the pricy Drunk Elephant drops — perfect for anyone who wants a lightweight alternative to foundation or just a lil' extra low-effort, ethereal shimmer in their lives. Promising review: ""Love love love this stuff. This is such a stellar product that is so versatile. Can be worn alone to put some glowy life to skin. Add to foundation or layer it. Beautiful. Use it as a base where you put highlighter on top. Mix some with moisturizer. This, in my opinion, is better than so many high-luxury brands that make similar products. And I am pretty sure it can be used by all skin types. It's not an oily feeling at all, and it doesn't dry out the skin either. Just a total package. Can't beat the price either."" —Figgy08 Get it from Amazon for $13.98 (available in five shades). 4. Glossmetics' Lychee Overnight Lip Mask, a Laneige or Tatcha alternatve that's already a cult-fave in the making — you can wear this non-stick, ultra glossy lip shine during the day or overnight as a lip treatment to help hydrate, soften, and condition your lips. Not to mention you will taste *delectable* all day and night (just ask the many lychee martinis I have downed on this here earth!) . Promising review: ""I'm obsessed with lip products. I have tried everything you can imagine, inexpensive and expensive. This is my favorite lip product I've purchased. This gloss is incredible, perfectly moisturizing, and the color is so perfect, a very light natural glowy pink. I just came on Amazon to order a couple more to have one in the car, my purse, nightstand.""..."

So holidays abroad were well and truly put on hold. As a result, I have become a dab hand at faking that gorgeous glow that you really only get after a week or two on holiday. I'm talking unrivalled radiance, sun-kissed cheeks and golden limbs that make every outfit look better. As a beauty editor, I've made it my mission over the past year to find the products that warm up the skin to make me look (and feel) healthier quickly. From tinted SPFs and bronzers, to instant tans and illuminating primers, trust me when I say I have done the legwork to find out which products apply well, look most natural and crucially, make me look radiant and tanned. Because, call me fickle, that's all I really ever want. Here I break down the different steps of my ultimate instant glow routine, which I swear by... My love of self-tan started with tanning drops. As a naturally fair 'English rose', I had always been incredibly nervous of fake tan and the inevitable mishaps that come with it. However, when I was introduced to the Isle Of Paradise Self Tanning Drops, I liked that they gave me the sense of control. It wasn't long before these little drops of sunshine became a firm fixture in my everyday skincare routine. I believe the recommendation is to use them every other day, but a few drops in my moisturiser every morning means that my skin always has a lovely, glowy canvas to apply the rest of my products. The Caudalie Self-Tan Sun Drops have become another favourite. To avoid any obvious tell-tale signs around my hairline, I use a big kabuki brush to buff my moisturiser and tanning drops in, which allows for a more natural finish. Isle of Paradise elf Tanning Face Drops in Medium Self-Tan Sun Drops Once I've applied my moisturiser, laced with tanning drops, I go in with my SPF. I've always loved a product that does more, and a base product with added sun protection is right up my street. Heliocare's 360 Colour Water Gel Bronze SPF50+ gives my skin just the right amount of coverage, evens out any irregular tone in an instant and blends in beautifully. The texture is similar to a lightweight foundation, so once I've applied it with my hands, I often buff it in with a foundation brush in areas that need thinning out slightly, like around my nose. Despite its name, it warms, rather than bronzes, the skin. And it does so beautifully. The viral Beauty of Joseon Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen is another knockout product, with 12 shades to choose from. 360 Colour Water Gel Bronze SPF50+ Beauty of Joseon Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen SPF30 PA+++ Every time I wear the L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion, I receive a compliment. Not only does it add a touch of colour to the skin, but it's the pearlescent sheen that it leaves behind that really makes a difference. You can use it as a primer, as I like to, tapped in as a highlighter or mixed in with your foundation for a more subtle finish. Vieve's iconic Skin Nova Instant Radiance Primer works similarly, but without the bronzing effect. Both transform tired skin in an instant. L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion Skin Nova Instant Radiance Primer Bronzer is arguably the must-have product in any glowing skin routine. Everybody has a preferred texture; mine will always be cream. I have dry and often dehydrated skin, so I prefer cream and liquid textures that won't settle in dry patches or fine lines. I couldn't write about tanned-looking skin without including Chanel's mega (in size and results) Les Beiges Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream. Not only does it give a natural-looking effect (which is down to its velvet matte finish), but it lasts and lasts, so is worth the investment. Earlier this year, the shade range grew, meaning it finally works for all skin tones. I can't ignore the fact that this giant bronzer does not travel well, so when I'm away from home or on the go, I use the Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Truffle. This twist-up cream bronzer has a slightly dewier finish compared to Chanel's, but the pigment payoff is great, and stick formulations make for easy application. Les Beiges Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Truffle In the middle of last summer, blonzing (a technique that blends bronzer and blusher together) became a viral make-up trend...."

1lyh32u,2025-07-13 01:52:31,en,REDDIT,"  Gosh guys, as much as I am liking the sober life so far (~3 weeks in), I did not expect it to cause problems in my marriage. 1. Never realized that most of the “dates” I used to have with my husband involved drinking together, either by the campfire, in the pool, while barbecuing in the back yard in the evening, etc. So now that I am actively avoiding these situations so I am not tempted, he made a snarky comment about how I am “never around” cuz I am at the gym or at a meeting. 2. Also I was not fully aware how much he drinks. Part of it was me kinda looking the other way before cuz I was drinking also and I wasn't one to judge…but now that I am NOT, it's becoming an elephant in the room. He drinks several beers nearly every day; and yesterday he started at 11:00 am cuz a friend dropped by. I wouldn't say that he is an alcoholic like me, but …? 3. He made another snarky remark today about “good thing I never made a video of the shit you would say to me when you were drunk.” Obviously there's some resentment there and I kept my mouth shut after apologizing. But this is why I quit! Why throw it in my face now? I am scared that we might not be compatible if I am sober and he is not. Anyone have tips?"
