mov_EEBF6001ED91FED1A8C2D2E17876BFD0,2025-06-14 09:31:02,en,WEB,"  This $10 ""hairspray for your face"" is about to become your setting spray holy grail in the heat. Fun fact: Amazon has an ""Internet Famous"" section curated with TikTok-viral products. Here are a few of the current ones so beloved by reviewers that they are *definitely* worth the hype: 1. A delightfully affordable instant foot peeling spray for anyone ready to go full YEEHAW!! on that at-home pedicure. This not only helps gently remove dead skin, but moisturizes dry and cracked heels, so you'll really get some refreshing bang for your buck. Promising review: ""This product delivers exactly as promised and is incredibly easy to use. I suffer from dry skin and often apply various products to soften my feet. With this, I simply spray it on and immediately massage it in with my hands. The dead skin comes off effortlessly. There's no waiting time, and it's gentle on the skin. It leaves my feet feeling exceptionally soft. This has quickly become my new favorite thing."" —KimT Price: $5.48 2. La Roche-Posay Anthelios SPF 40 Tinted Sunscreen, aka the ""holy grail"" of tinted sunscreens — reviewers love this lightweight, buildable formula so much that a lot of them replaced their foundation with it altogether. If you're in the market for some subtle but effective coverage that won't get goopy or settle in pores, this is your sunscreen match made in heaven. Psst, you can find the Attitude Oceanly Lip Balm that reviewer is wearing on Amazon! Promising review: ""Like a lot of women over 50 I prefer to use a tinted sunscreen instead of foundation these days. I have tried a dozen, and this one is the winner, hands down! It has a thin, non-greasy texture, no odor, and is lightweight and buildable if you want a little more coverage in certain areas. Best of all it does not settle in to pores or fine lines at all. So many of the others I've tried, including high-end expensive ones that are pushed heavily on social media, are greasy and settle into every pore and line. I've put this on auto ship and hope it never gets discontinued!"" —Chartwell Price: $39.99 (available in four tinted and non-tinted) 3. Lottabody's Coconut Oil Foaming Curl Mousse designed for all hair types to give you satisfyingly hydrated, volumized, frizz-free curls at a FRACTION of the price of its competitors. Promising review: ""I have super frizzy, curly hair and live in New England, where we have super humid summers. I have been struggling to find a product that de-frizzes my hair without making it look oiled down, and this is it. I put it in my wet hair after washing, towel dried, and put my hair in a ponytail to go to work. My hair was frizz-free all night — even working outside in high humidity. People even asked if I did something to my hair! This is an amazing product for the price. Absolutely buying again and would recommend to anyone with a frizz issue."" —Marissa Price: $3.98 4. Clinique Almost Lipstick Tinted Lip Balm in *PINK* Honey — aka, the sweet, subtle sister of the iconic ""Black Honey"" that has been so popular over the past few decades that it just about broke TikTok when it finally had its moment over there. The skin tone-matching, pH-adaptive pink version is every bit as buildable, polished, and decadent feeling as the original black honey, and perfect for everyday makeup looks. The ""Almost Lipsticks"" are also well-known for working as a subtle lip *and* blush shade for a perfectly dewy, au naturelllll look! Promising review: ""This lip color is a fantastic, no-fuss lip product for those who want a natural, effortless look. It offers the best of both world s— hydrating balm and a hint of color — making it ideal for daily wear. It's perfect for those looking for a low-maintenance, lightweight lip option with a natural finish. While it may not be the longest-lasting product, its comfort and versatility make it a great addition to any beauty routine."" —The Unexpected Girl Mama Price: $25 (also available in the OG Black Honey) 5...."
mov_088DAFAE8F2BF57FD37824896FB92E8E,2025-06-14 12:00:48,en,WEB,"  It is lunchtime in central London and hungry patrons are filing into the newly crowned best restaurant in the country. This time, it is not a sparsely furnished warehouse conversion where you have to squint to see your natural wine. Nor is it a buzzy A-list hotspot, where the chefs will vet your social media before you have even arrived. Instead, it is the Ritz: the 119-year-old British institution where denim is outlawed, etiquette is king and selfies are met with a disapproving frown. Hailed the best restaurant in the UK this week by the National Restaurant awards, the hallowed dining hall of one of London's grandest hotels harks back to a time of heavy tablecloths and silver service, straight-backed chairs and seven courses. A meal at the Mayfair hotel, whose gilded restaurant is as renowned for its stringent dress code (men are expected to wear a jacket and tie) as its £62 crêpe suzette, was described by the competition's judges as a “wonderful and memorable assault on the senses”. But what do its patrons, who come from far and wide to sample the beef wellington and hay-aged Bresse duck served arts de la table, really think? “It's second to none – there's nothing else like it,” says Yvonne Robertson, a 55-year-old fitness instructor from Glasgow who came last year and is now back for a photograph under the hotel's arches. “It's first class – a whole-day experience. We got all dolled up and were in there for hours.” It is no wonder that for many it is a once-in-a-lifetime trip: the restaurant's three-course lunch menu rings in at £92, while the five-course à la carte dining experience will set you back £199 (throw in another £700 if you want the prestige wine pairing). “It's not cheap,” admitted the competition judges, “but when eating at this level of luxury you wouldn't expect it to be.” Robertson's companion, Audrey O'Neill, an administrator, is inclined to agree. “It's exceptional,” she says. Just try not to drop anything on the floor. “My champagne glass fell off the table – I was mortified,” she says, laughing. The waiters came to her assistance faster than you could say: “White gloves.” In the hotel lobby, which smells like fresh peonies, French perfume and, well, money, even the hotel's youngest patron is enamoured of the chandeliers and soft piano music. “It's her first trip to the Ritz,” says 38-year-old Marie-Claire Lowry, motioning to her baby daughter, Marlie, who is propped happily on an ornate green sofa with a crumbled scone. More in Lifestyle “Everything is pristine,” says Lowry, who is treating her mother, Janice Lowry, to a “posh cup of tea” for her 74th birthday. They will not quite make it all the way into what the judges called “London's most decadent dining room” this time, but will definitely be back. “We dropped something of the baby's on the floor and we're not even worried because it's probably so clean,” she says. “Even my hands smell amazing from the soap in the bathrooms.” Headed by the executive chef, John Williams, the historic dining room – visited by prime ministers and princesses, and painted in a pink colour palette designed to complement a lady's blush – was quietly awarded its second Michelin star in February. Now, it has beaten Notting Hill's celebrity favourite the Ledbury to be crowned best in show. Not everyone, though, is quite so charmed by its grandeur. “I had a very nice beef wellington,” says Clayton Such, a 44-year-old chief executive from San Francisco. “But I'm not sure it's the best restaurant in the UK. I think the whole vibe of the Ritz … is people who want to pretend to be wealthy versus just being wealthy.” It did not help that he was politely but firmly told to put on a jacket and tie for dinner when he wandered down from his hotel room in a short-sleeved shirt. “It definitely seems like a place where people want to put on airs,” he says."

mxvfbmk,2025-06-15 07:09:39,en,REDDIT,"  Let me start saying, as many others have said, you have fabulous bone structure and once you figure out what works for you, you are going to be drop dead gorgeous. I'm a bit older than most here so my recommendations might be out of date but I know a lot of department stores used to do free makeup makeovers. It would be awesome if someone here would tell you what places still do them??? Maybe Sephora? If you are able to get one, i would ask them what products they are using and why, what are they for. Then you can go to your local store or on Amazon, and find similar products that fit your budget. I use a lot of Elf products and really love them. They work well and are inexpensive. A lot is trial and error but Wet n Wild and NYX have some good products too. Concealer, foundation, and a finishing powder would help with any parts you want to cover up. Because you are a ""winter"" as another person said, you would look great with some rose/pink blush, black eyeliner and black mascara and red lipstick. You can try more neutral lipsticks too but I think a red lip would really pop. Please post some before and after photos for us; I'd love to see what you decide on and how the makeup you choose looks on you. After reading your story, I know a lot of us are rooting for you!! Best of luck!"

1lbxi0r,2025-06-15 10:49:19,en,REDDIT,"  i've always felt like i was nonbinary/genderfluid, but lately i've identified more as a man and i'm convinced i want to get more masculine. i'd consider myself pretty androgynous, i've always hated wearing dresses, wearing pink, long hair, typical ""girl things"", only now that i'm 22 i have two maxi skirts that i rarely wear but they're pretty and i don't necessarily consider them femenine, i also do my makeup on rare occasions (school mostly) and even then i don't go all girl, just basic covering up eyebag stuff and some blush to look human. since i was 13/14, i've been dressing like a ""tomboy"" and really got a kick out of people confusing me for a boy, then i had this big gender dysphoria """"phase"""" and came out to my mom but it didn't last, i honestly don't remember much of that time, i'm pretty sure i ""detransitioned"" because of social pressure (middle school kids are assholes), ever since then, i've alternated between an androgynous/femenine style, and people have exclusively referred to me as a she (even though i openly use they/them pronouns), i used to not mind it but with time it started to irk me whenever people called me by my bio name/she pronouns, i told this to my closest friends and to refer me as a he and gave them a preferred name, honestly it just feels so much better, like it's people actually talking to me and not a front i have to put out to the world. as for people in my life, family is accepting of the lgbt+ community, my college isn't, it really bothers me that i have to be closeted there but i also know it's safer. i had a boyfriend last year who was sort of transphobic, told me he didn't ""get"" the whole ""trans thing"" and that even though i told him to refer to me as a ""he"", i'd always be his g*rlfriend (eugh), that gave me really really big dysphoria, so much that i broke up with him and started heavily considering of all this. as for my body image, i've always considered my chest a nuisance, even though it's not that big (and i think i can reduce it with exercise, which i'll also be starting), i hate the way it protrudes out of my body, how it looks in tight clothing, touching it feels like i'm touching someone else's and i really dislike it. other than that, i guess my hips are feminine and i don't like them either but not as much as i hate my chest. i talked to my mom a couple of hours ago and she supported me, told me to do some things first: school/documenting things and going to therapy to really ""find out"" what i need, she also told me she was unsure if this is what i wanted because, as i mentioned above, i've always been androgynous/nonbinary, so going for a more ""binary"" look would be ""contradicting""?? not sure if that makes sense. also asked my preferred name/pronouns for the mean time, so that was a big relief. :p i'm so sure that i want a deeper voice, facial hair and fat/muscle redistribution to appear more masculine, but i'm scared that this is ""another phase"" and it will go away ""again"", if it makes sense. i've also been doomscrolling this subreddit and found so many stories about acne/menstrual cycles going crazy, right now i have a regular cycle, i've dealt with pms and bv/yeast infections before but nothing big, and i don't know if T will make it better or worse and i'm scared of that too. honestly i typed all of this because i needed to scream into the void. i wanted to ask if any of you have had similar experiences, if you're on T and how life is, anything is appreciated."

Grab it for $24 at Amazon from a woman-owned company. It separates seven days of pills with a securely locking lid. Opening the lid can be tricky with short nails. Discussing the fashionability of a pill case? Yes, we're aging — but at least we're doing it in style. The need for a pill organizer is a classic mile marker on the road to maturity (I begrudgingly hit that one in my early 30s), and one of our editors says this Dosey Pill Compact is the perfect way to keep your meds straight without feeling like an antique. Rather than the flimsy plastic look of most pill organizers, it has the sleek shape of a designer sunglasses case. An Amazon shopper summed up its appeal by calling it “not your everyday, old-lady pill caddy.” Dosey Pill Compact in Sage Amazon ""After developing migraines and allergies last year (aging sucks), I started taking a medical cocktail of supplements and pills and had trouble keeping them all straight,” shares PEOPLE shopping editor Madison Yauger. That led her to Dosey's pill organizer, which she calls “the perfect, compact travel hack and everyday essential.” These flip-top pill organizers have a mirror on the inside and hold seven days of meds in dedicated slots. Yauger says each compartment “easily” fits four pills and three gummy vitamins while still letting the lid snap shut. In fact, the lid locks so securely that it's the only slight complaint she has about the Dosey Pill Compact. You have to use the tip of your nail to open the case, but the reviews say it's not too tough. “Once you get used to opening it, it's a breeze, and I have no nails,” wrote a second Amazon shopper. “No mix-up of any of my pills even if I shake the case. [It] even holds my tiny allergy pills in place in each section.” To keep it clean, Yauger uses a damp paper towel to wipe out the pill compartments every week. “The sage green exterior and gold mirroring inside is so sleek,” she added. “'Obsessed' is an understatement.

mxxbiyc,2025-06-15 15:48:10,en,REDDIT,"  # Heroes of Humanity “Here they come!” “I've been waiting for so long to see them!” “Do you think they can really do it?” The crowd roared as six figures walked up on the stage. Indifference, Desire, Doubt, Arrogance, Curiosity and Loyalty. The heroes that have fought against both angels and demons alike and have survived to tell the tale. Humankind plastered their faces across stores, flags, clothing and dishware. Their names were sung and poems were written in their wake, no demon had managed to harm a single human in twenty years because of them. And no angel had come to claim the lives of those that are guilty out of fear. But reality was much crueler than that. Compared to the two forces, humanity had only six great warriors while both angels and demons each boasted seven. A bubbly girl with pink hair picked a small microphone from its stand, climbing up onto the stone railing before all humans. Phones flashed, every lens was drawn to her magnetic presence. “All eyes on me please!” She struck a cute pose and the crowd went wild chanting her name like a god. “””DESIRE! ””” Her giggles echoed through the massive square before the parliament building, and with a single motion of the hand, it all ceased. “As you know, we the great heroes of humanity have fought with all of our strength against the forces of evil and good. But…” She turned her gaze back to her team members who were in a much worse condition than her. “We cannot continue to fight this battle alone.” The crowd gasped, a seed of panic began spreading through their hearts like wildfire. The seed quickly bloomed and confused roars erupted asking about their survival. Desire sat onto the stone railing, her feet crossed together, for a second, her eyebrows creased downward at the words that were soon to follow. Steps echoed from behind the six valiant heroes as a seventh figure appeared from the shadows. A flying bottle hurtled through the air, aimed directly at Desire. With the flick of a hand, a panel of pure light flashed into existence and blocked the bottle. “You people are always the same.” He muttered under his breath. “We have found our seventh warrior of humanity! Fear!!” A silent round of applause echoed on the stage as a short young man, no older than fifteen took to the stage in front of what seemed to be a million people. Desire offered the mic but he denied it quickly, shaking his head with a slight blush on his face. “He, despite his small stature, is the final Neutrality. Once he is trained, we will be able to stand on equal footing with both the Gods and Devils, and maybe, just maybe, push them back!” Her voice was laced with honey and wine, sweeping across the crowd like a heatwave. The beautiful roars of determination returned, and the candle of humanity was lit once more. The seven walked back inside the building, Fear deciding to stick close to Desire. She was the one who found him during an extermination of demons while trying to protect civilians. But unlike the others, Desire hadn't been trying to save them. She had been trying to kill them. And she remembered the shield that stopped her blade. Thanks for the awesome prompt! I enjoyed writing it, this is the story after I revised it three times, but feedback is welcome!!!"

1lc76y7,2025-06-15 18:22:40,en,REDDIT,"  I am over 6 months pregnant and have a formal wedding coming up this Friday and I've been shopping for over a month and cannot find anything that looks decent, makes me feel good, and isn't over $100. I already have such a hard time shopping even before I was pregnant. I'm tall with a large chest. But I'm not plus sized except for my bust. Going braless was never an option before pregnancy and it's certainly not an option now. I'm too big for pink blush maternity's regular clothing sizes and their plus size is either too big, not my style, or out of stock. I can't afford a site like JJ's and it's too late now anyway. The one and only dress I found on Macy's is somehow too big and too small at the same time. And there's not a single store around here that offers maternity styles in store besides Target (too casual) and whatever is on the clearance rack at kohls. I'm stuck in whatever Amazon can ship to me by Wednesday but even then I swear I've ordered them all and tried them on and nothing is right. Plus I can't find anything that's “formal” it's all semi formal or cocktail and I don't want to embarrass myself by being under dressed as well as pregnant. I've been crying about this for two days. I don't want to go anymore."

2a8eb762279ab0ffc32d7c47374f4699,2025-06-17 14:20:00,en,WEB,"  Every home reflects its inhabitants—not only through wide-sweeping design choices but also through the subtle, everyday details that shape our experience. A cozy reading nook might be defined by the texture of a throw pillow, the glow of a well-placed lamp, or the way fabrics feel against your skin. In this post, we'll explore how small tweaks and thoughtful touches can elevate your personal haven. 1. Light Layers: Embrace Soft Illumination Lighting does more than just brighten a room—it sets the mood. Multiple light sources : Incorporate ambient, task, and accent lighting. For instance, a warm table lamp next to your armchair invites you to linger, while a brighter overhead fixture serves practical needs. Dimmer switches : These let you adjust light intensity for various moments—cheerful during breakfast, mellow by evening. Warm bulbs : Swap harsh fluorescents for bulbs with softer, warmer tones (around 2700–3000   K) to create a welcoming glow. Even small bulbs transform how a space feels, reflecting who you are. 2. Layered Textures: Comfort Through Feeling We respond to surfaces as much as to forms. Rugs over bare floors : A plush rug underfoot adds comfort and visual interest, tying elements together. Blankets and throws : Draped casually over sofas or chairs, they beg to be used and showcase personal taste—whether knitted, woven, or velvet. Mix-and-match fabrics : Combining smooth linens, velvets, and woven cushions creates a tactile tapestry that invites interaction. These combinations foster cozy atmospheres beyond what aesthetics alone can achieve. 3. Well-Curated Surfaces: Intentional Simplicity Countertops, shelves, and tables tell a story when curated thoughtfully. Edit regularly : Remove anything that feels out of place or no longer serves daily life. Purposeful displays : Books, vases, or art objects become more meaningful if they reflect your identity and aren't lost in clutter . Negative space : Leaving some surfaces clear conveys calm, so that treasured items stand out without chaos. A carefully arranged console table speaks volumes through its restraint. 4. Greenery and Natural Elements Bringing life indoors energizes the senses. Houseplants : From sturdy succulents to leafy monstera , plants purify air and add visual softness. Natural materials : Wood, stone, wicker, and rattan bring texture and warmth—think woven baskets or marble coasters. Fresh flowers : Even a single bloom in a vase revitalizes a room with color and scent. These organic touches connect daily life to the wider seasons and cycles of nature. 5. Personalized Accents Your personal space should feel uniquely “you.” Sentimental objects : A small collection, a framed memory, or a travel memento keeps meaningful stories close. Artful alignment : Consider eyebrow height for frames and mirrors; small shifts in height can feel natural yet distinctive. Signature colors : One accent color repeated—say, mustard , blush pink, or teal—creates cohesion without overhauling the space. These signature choices reveal personality in subtle but powerful ways. 6. Thoughtful Hardware and Fixtures Fittings are often overlooked, but they matter. Drawer pulls and knobs : A simple copper or brass knob can elevate a plain dresser. Switch plates and outlet covers : Coordinated finishes—black matte or polished gold—make even small details feel intentional. High-Quality switches and hinges : Smooth, tactile controls enhance daily interactions far beyond their visual impact. These small updates give a sense of thoughtful presence in every touch. 7. Framing Your Reflection Mirrors expand light and space. Strategic placement : Across from windows or behind light sources, mirrors amplify brightness. Decorative frames : From sleek modern to vintage bevels, the frame reinforces your overall style. Functional solutions : A vanity mirror invites detail, beauty, and clarity into your morning routine—perfect for a personal dressing table. A well-placed mirror, like a luxurious Vanity Mirror , can subtly become the focal point that ties a room together, enhancing both appearance and practical function. 8. Scents and Sound Ambience isn't only visual. Scent layers : A reed diffuser, unscented candles, and occasional sprays let you switch mood with a breath. Background sound : A Bluetooth speaker tucked away can provide mellow music, nature sounds, or white noise to transform atmosphere in an instant...."

Not only is it beautiful in brightening up your face as cheek color… but incorporating it on your lips pulls the entire look together and makes a statement day to night.

Long story short, I'm a total sucker for peonies and - lucky for me - they cope relatively well with our tough soils, frosty winters, and dry summers. As many of my peonies are not yet fully established, or I have not kept good records for all of them, flowering is marked * where the flowering period is taken from online descriptions rather than my own observation. In my garden, peony season begins in early October and finishes in December. I'm working on gathering early and late flowering varieties to extend the season. I will add more photos during the 2025 flowering season.

The Evolv Collection's standout terrace destinations are now open, inviting Londoners and visitors alike to soak up the season in style. Whether you're in the mood for sky-high spritzes with iconic skyline views, leisurely lunches under the sun, or sipping steins with a Bavarian twist, these dreamy outdoor spaces are serving serious summer energy. Here's what's on offer across The Evolv Collection's gorgeous terraces at Madison , Bluebird Chelsea , and German Gymnasium — all right here in London. Madison x Aperol Spritz Perched high above the London skyline,  Madison's  terrace has long been a go-to for sweeping views and golden-hour gatherings. This summer, it returns with a refreshed identity – partnering once again with Aperol to unveil its 2025 Spritz Terrace: a sensory celebration of the Italian aperitivo set against the backdrop of St Paul's Cathedral. Designed to transport guests from the city buzz to rooftop bliss, the terrace has been reimagined as an urban oasis. Highlights include a bespoke infinity pool-inspired seating installation with cascading water features, and Aperol's signature orange rendered in glowing accents. It's an al fresco haven designed for both indulgence and escape. The seasonal cocktail menu reflects this mood of Mediterranean ease. While the Aperol Spritz remains the centrepiece – bittersweet, effervescent and always iconic – it's joined by several equally compelling companions: Aperol Spritz:  The classic aperitivo: Prosecco, Aperol, soda water, and a slice of orange. Campari Spritz:  A bolder take: Prosecco, Campari, soda, with a refined edge. Sarti Spritz : A fruit-forward blend of Prosecco, Sarti Rosa, soda, and lime, with notes of mango, passionfruit, and blood orange. Crodino Spritz : A sophisticated non-alcoholic spritz option, with a blend of botanicals that's then left to infuse for 6 months to give it that distinctive bittersweet taste. Guests can now enjoy Madison's ever-popular weekend brunch with a sun-soaked twist: bottomless Aperol Spritz. Think  Buttermilk Fried Chicken & Waffles ,  Crab Benedict , and  Truffle Scrambled Eggs  – each dish crafted to pair perfectly with a chilled spritz. For all-day dining, the à la carte menu still impresses, featuring standout plates like  Garlic Shrimp Rigatoni alla Vodka  – rich, creamy, and with just the right kick – or the  Teriyaki Fillet of Sea Bass , paired with a miso datterini salad, samphire, and nori. Bluebird Chelsea x Mirabeau Summer Terrace From the sun-drenched hills of Provence to the heart of West London,  Bluebird Chelsea  unveils  The Secret Garden in partnership with  Mirabeau . Nestled in the heart of the King's Road, Bluebird Chelsea invites guests to step into  The Secret Garden  – a sun-dappled summer terrace brought to life with blooming botanicals and blush pink florals. Here, every moment is viewed through rosé-tinted glasses, where the spirit of Provence meets the vibrant energy of West London. The bespoke menu features an enticing selection of Mirabeau wines and rosé and gin cocktails, making for a perfect toast to long, sunlit days and balmy evenings. Adding to the summer charm, Bluebird Chelsea will host an exclusive  Endless Lunch  on Friday 15th August, a relaxed, indulgent affair where guests can enjoy Mirabeau rosé and a sharing style menu for £65pp. It's the ultimate way to soak up the sun and savour the season in style. Golden Bloom:  Sunshine in a glass. Mirabeau Gin, Chartreuse Yellow, El Jimador Tequila, Rose Syrup and Lemon Juice  Hidden Nectar:  Fruity and refreshing. Mirabeau Gin,  Crème  De Peches, Passion Fruit Juice, Passion Fruit Pur é e, Lemon Juice and Simple Syrup   Midnight Reverie:  Rich and refined. Mirabeau Azure,  Crème De Cassis, Durello Spumante Palladiano, Fever-Tree Soda  Mirabeau x Fever-Tree Rosé Spritz:  Light, Sparkling and aromatic. French Rosé wine with Raspberry & Orange Blossom Soda. German Gymnasium Beer Terrace Prost! This summer,  German Gymnasium  invites you to raise a stein to the season on its vibrant Biergarten-Terrasse. With crisp, refreshing pours of authentic  Warsteiner Pilsner,  guests can savour the essence of a German summer right in the heart of London, no travel required!

The brand new  Kinematographie cocktail menu  is a cinematic tribute to the legends of German film.

The menu includes: The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari:  Monkey 47, St. Germain, Maraschino, Kiwi, Lime & Soda water  Metropolis : Casamigos Tequila, Bleu Curacao, Mint & Wasabi, and Mexican Lime Soda  Dr. Mabuse:  Dalmore 12, Amaretto, Banana Liqueur, Coconut cream & lemon  Liebe 47:  Earl Grey infused Sauvelle Vodka, Aperol, Lemon & Honey  Zimmer 13:  Malfy Gin, Limoncello, Pineapple & Basil Cordial, Elderflower Soda  The Neverending Story:  Flor de cana, Six grapes port, Strawberry, Vanilla, Citrus & Crème Fraiche.

myglyps,2025-06-18 15:09:34,en,REDDIT,"  I just have a great makeup base lol ✌︎(  •͈ ᗜ•͈ )✌︎. I use the Milani Conceal and Perfect foundation, along with the L'Oreal True Match concealer :3. I color correct any reddness and hyperpigmentation before applying a concealer that matches my skintone to any imperfections. Then I apply my foundation by putting some on the back of my hand, warming it up with my finger, and gliding it across sections of my face in increments before blending it out. After that, I use a concealer slightly lighter than my skin tone, and apply a very small amount to any existing impurities. I use the NYX Contour stick by picking some product up with a dense brush and applying it under my cheekbones and around my jawline and forehead. I use a small brush to pick up more product to contour my nose, as well. After I contour, I go back and reblend anything that looks cakey before going in with the Maybelline Fit Me pressed finishing powder. If I want my makeup to be super long lasting, I'll do a spritz of the Elf Micro Setting Spray before I set everything in with the powder. Once everything is set, I use a cool powder contour and LIGHTLY dust over the areas I contoured to be sure they're set. I then use the Physicians Formula Strawberry Jam blush on top of my cheekbones, right below my eye in a lil circle. I apply the product with a small fluffy brush. My eyeshadow frequently changes, but my current fixation has been using a pink shade similar to my blush around the end corner of my eye, and using a cool brown in my crease. The eyeliner I use is the NYX Epic Wear liner in black. I like to draw my wings pretty big and downturned. I also contour my aegyo sal using the same shade I dusted under my cheekbones with. I curl my eyelashes before using a mix of the Sky High mascara and Telescopic mascara. Sometimes ill stop there, but I'll usually apply my big manga lashes using a Black lash glue by kiss. My lashes are from a random pack from Amazon (´•̥ω•̥｀). Finally, ill apply my highlighter to my inner corners and the tip of my nose before going a final spritz of my setting spray. QUICK NOTE!! I forgot to mention that I'll usually do my brows with a dark eyeshadow before I apply my color correcter. ALSO, my skin routine before I apply makeup is as follows: Rinse face with cold water Hello Kitty Strawberry Milk toner Milk eye cream Hydrating serum Water mist Snail Mucin moisturizer Bubble sunscreen I let my face sit for a moment before applying the NYX Angel Veil primer :3 Holy yap, I wrote a lot (´•ω•̥`) Regardless, hope you find this useful!!"

The couple shared a few affectionate moments, packing on the PDA as they watched the races from the stands. Princess Anne's daughter, 44, stood out from the crowd in a floral-inspired look. However, it came as a surprise when she broke her number one fashion rule — coordinating with Mike, 46. The duo are known for their perfectly matched outfits at high-profile events, often complementing one another through harmonious colour palettes, coordinated accessories, or subtle style echoes. Article continues below The mother-of-three looked effortlessly elegant in her charming ensemble as she sweetly packed on the PDA with Mike. She wore a cream midi dress adorned with a vintage-inspired floral print in soft pink and red tones, and was spotted gazing into her husband's eyes. The dress featured voluminous puff sleeves, a high neckline, and a flared skirt, creating a classic, feminine silhouette that was perfect for the occasion.

Read our Privacy Policy She accessorised with a blush pink pillbox hat, styled with her hair swept back in a chic updo, and kept her jewellery minimal for a clean, polished finish. The look was both refined and romantic — a perfect nod to summer race day style. While Mike stuck to Ascot tradition with a polished morning suit, elevated by playful accessories like a blue tie and patterned pocket square. This was a refined yet personal twist on classic race day dressing. The contrast in their looks was noticeable, especially as the pair are usually known for their well-matched ensembles. Despite the mismatch, both looked elegant and confident, each showcasing their individual style. Royal fans took to X, formerly known as Twitter, and penned: “I love Zara and Mike. They always look so beautiful. You can see their true love.” “Zara knows how to dress, always so classy,” added a second. While a third chimed in and wrote, “So elegant and sophisticated.” Stay up-to-date with the latest Royal news Join us on WhatsApp Our community members are treated to special offers, promotions, and adverts from us and our partners.

And there's nothing worse than picking up a new tube just to learn that you can't, in fact, pull off the same bright red shade as Taylor Swift. Our beauty experts think the best lipsticks for everyone come in muted shades, like light pinks, beiges, and barely-there glosses. For this piece, we looked to beauty industry leaders like Allure, Cosmo, and our celebrity style gurus like Reese Witherspoon and Kelly Ripa. Each shade comes recommended from fellow beauty editors, stylists, Amazon shoppers, or our own staff members. Quick OverviewSee 10 more Swipe of these shades will give your pout some punch, even on those ""no makeup"" makeup days. No matter your skin tone or lip product preference, you'll be able to find a shade that's perfectly you on our list. Read on to discover all our favorite universally-flattering lipsticks below. For a kiss of barely-there color, opt for this fetching shade. This hyaluronic-acid-infused lipstick provides a natural-looking hue in a sheer application. Many reviewers on Amazon have professed their love: ""This is my all-time favorite lipstick! This is probably my sixth or seventh tube. I never repeat-buy lipsticks like that! It's so natural looking, but enough to give your lips a blush of color. I love that it has SPF too."" $35 at Amazon This gorgeous velvet lip tint is as much fun to apply as it looks. It doesn't look like a conventional lip stick (more like a nail polish bottle), but once it's applied, it provides an intriguing matte shade that looks incredible on all faces. Nearly 30,000 shoppers swear by it, calling it ""wonderful,"" ""lightweight,"" and their ""go-to shade."" $10 at Amazon How about a lip balm that creates a customized color just for you? Glimmer Balm glides on clear, then teams up with your skin's pH to almost magically create the perfect shade of pink to flatter your exact skin tone. It's also super moisturizing, giving the look of lipstick but providing the texture of a balm. One reviewer said: ""This lip balm is so amazing. I've never used anything like it before. You will love it, too. It has just the perfect shimmer, is barely noticeable, and it really does change color on your lips almost immediately. I am amazed at how long it stays visible; I've tried lots of lipsticks that claim to stay on and don't. This one really does. You're going to love it!"" $17 at Amazon This lipstick is a favorite among editors at Allure, who named it the best matte lipstick of 2024. It comes in nine satin shades and eight matte ones, all of which look gorgeous when applied. We particularly love the Classic - Neutral shade, which adds a bit of texture without drastically over-coloring your lips. $26 at Merit This moisturizing lipstick/balm hybrid delivers a pretty flush of color to enhance your natural lip shade while brightening your overall complexion. The color is buildable too, so you can reapply as needed until you find the coverage you crave. Nearly 2,900 verified Amazon shoppers adore this lipstick as much as we do and bless it with flawless five-star reviews. One said: ""The perfect sheer look with a hint of color; it smells great and feels really nice on the lips. It's perfect for a no-makeup makeup look, and the product looks expensive. Really good find — I'm glad I finally found the perfect lip moisturizer!"" $9 at Amazon We spotted Reese Witherspoon in this Clinique shade this year, and while she would look incredible in just about anything, we loved the way this lipstick shined. It comes in quite a range of shades, but we love the AM Blushing Pop color pictured here. $26 at Amazon Lip nourishment meets luminescent color with these shimmery faves! There are eight hues to choose from, each available in a 4-pack, but the Fig shade looks especially great on just about everyone. The formula is sure to please, too, thanks to therapeutic ingredients like sunflower oil and vitamin E. More than 5,300 Amazon reviewers love this one as their everyday lippie...."

Picture a long table under climbing roses, glassware catching the late-day sun, and a bright perfume settling on sun-warmed skin. The moment invites every guest to breathe deeper and taste slower, creating the lingering calm that defines a perfect summer night. Why Pair Perfume With a Cocktail? Perfumers and mixologists work in layers. A scent's top notes mirror a cocktail's garnish, heart notes echo the drink's body, and base notes linger like a smooth finish of aged spirits. When a bergamot-rich perfume meets a spritz crowned with a lemon twist, the nose and palate move in harmony, making each sip feel intentional and every breath feel new. The Scent-Flavour Rulebook   Citrus meets citrus : lemon or mandarin perfumes brighten limoncello spritzes. Herbal embraces herbal : minty accords pair naturally with cucumber gin smashes. Gourmand mirrors gourmand : vanilla or tonka notes echo the creaminess of a salted-caramel espresso martini. Keep these links in mind and pairing becomes pure play. Six Signature Pairings  Amalfi Zest & Limoncello Spritz Sunlit mandarin sparks the first toast. Spritz a citrus-forward eau de parfum over linen napkins. Serve prosecco, limoncello, and a basil ribbon on crushed ice. One spray and one sip feel like a seaside holiday—no passport required. Garden Mint & Cucumber Gin Smash Green freshness keeps energy high. Shake gin with muddled cucumber, crushed ice, and a dash of herbal bitters. A spearmint-neroli perfume connects glass to garden, ideal for lawn games and relaxed conversation. Vanilla Cloud & Salted-Caramel Espresso Martini Comforting sweetness turns coffee into dessert. Spray a cozy vanilla fragrance that hints at toasted sugar. Shake espresso, vodka, cold-brew concentrate, and a pinch of sea salt until foamy. The shared gourmand theme feels luxurious yet familiar, encouraging guests to linger. Pink Peony & Rhubarb Fizz Floral sparkle lifts tart bubbles. Mix rhubarb syrup, dry rosé, club soda, and grapefruit juice. A dewy peony-rose perfume matches the cocktail's blush tone. Serve at sunset when sky and glass glow alike. Coastal Driftwood & Smoked Paloma Salty-smoky edges recall beach bonfires. Combine mezcal, ruby-red grapefruit, and a touch of saline. Garnish with charred rosemary. A woody-marine fragrance drifts over shoulders, echoing the drink's gentle smoke. Soft Lavender & White-Peach Bellini A lavender-peach duo soothes the evening. Blend puréed white peach with chilled prosecco and a rosemary sprig. A light lavender perfume keeps conversation calm while fruit notes keep spirits bright. Build Your Own Perfume Bar Turn guests into scent explorers with a simple tester station. Arrange labeled atomizers near the drinks. Add small jars of coffee beans for nose resets. Place cards suggesting which cocktail pairs with each perfume. Encourage a quick spritz on a pulse point before clinking glasses. Comparison chatter starts on its own when guests explore new notes. Perfume Dupes: Experiment Without the Splurge Dupes deliver designer vibes at everyday prices. These look-alike blends echo famous accords using wallet-friendly ingredients and gentle solvents...."

mymrvqh,2025-06-19 13:55:27,en,REDDIT,"  I'll do a step by step, but if you still need to understand what basic products are, you should watch YouTube MUA's, Robert Welsh, Kathleen Lights, and read product descriptions on Sephora's website. This is *my order* 2016 style with all products. Lmk if you want me to remove some. In a rush this takes me 25 minutes. (Edit do my makeup with me lmao. My foundation just came in… so I got the actual items down in right in the longer version). Items- Skincare (serum, moisturizer, spf) makeup- wait ~15 minutes. Primer, *I do brows here so they stick, brows welcome whenever you want as I touch up at the end- so powder brows & pencil* foundation, contour, cream bronzer, concealer *I add brown liquid eye-shadow/primer here* , liquid blush, (if layering and not underpainting) setting spray to blend. Bake undereyes and t-zone (bake what you want). Brush off with a fluffy brush & blend any loose powder, setting spray. Wait ~2 minutes to dry. Contour, bronzer, blush, highlight. Eyes- *you're welcome to do these first, I used to* mattes, shimmer lid, browbone, touch up. Liner, mascara, lashes, wing liner (not necessary last I wing after falsies now). Brow wax. Face application - *hold all brushes at far end to have the most control over amount of item applied 1. apply primer to lids as well with hands (Smashbox photo finish). 2. Liquid Contour applied with a flat *Morphe* concealer brush on top of cheekbones as it blends down, letting it sit for 2 minutes to warm up . I use the underpainting method with deep bronzers (pinky rose cosmetics extreme contour palette 3. A dark foundation stick- I liked the ABH one, not so much the Mario- also works *blend with RT200*/ bronzer duo Eloise sweet cheeks). 3. Brow start, Flat angled brush with eyeshadow in contour tones, define with pencil. Make an upside down V shape to get angle of brow correctly. Fluff up brow head by pointing upwards. 4. Concealer- apply liquid blush *very sheer* with finger taps. Apply brightening concealer in Triangle shape. Dot on eyelids, use a flat, wet concealer brush to line under brows and lift. Also base for eyeshadow. Add brown eyeshadow base to lids as a way to enhance out undertones in shadows (think duochrome over black v white base here). *Dot on any pimples or red spots with pink concealer, let dry 2 minutes or until tacky, blend with finger not brush* 5. Apply foundation mostly to under cheekbones & temple with liquid concealer brush in dots to face, give 2 minutes to warm up & blend *brushes/tools- It cosmetics CC plus/ airbrush foundation, RT sponge*.

myr29ix,2025-06-20 03:34:24,en,REDDIT,  So - I'm reading some comments here and looking at your photos and I have very similar eyes to you. First - I actually prefer your make up trial photos to all the rest. I think the lashes are really nice. I also know exactly why the artist didn't use liner all the way around into the inner corner - I have small eyes and that just makes them look even smaller and less open. I can not use liner into the inner corner. I've also read comments suggesting you put something in the bottom lash like mascara and/or liner. Like you - again I have small eyes as well as dark circles and some texture under my eyes ( literally same situation going on down there). Anything on my bottom lashes makes my under eye look darker and draws attention to imperfections there while again making my eyes look even smaller. I am also the same age as you I think and have the exact same skin and eye colour as well as hair colour. I can tell you what has worked for me. 1. Stick to dark brown eyeliner - the black is too harsh as we get older. I thought someone was going to have to pry my black eyeliner out of my cold dead hands but then I tried Charlotte Tilburys Feline flick eyeliner pen in brown. It's the perfect shade of brown. Not too dark- and not too cool for my ( our) skin tone. I highly recommend this. Black mascara is still more flattering than brown on me though. 2. The under eye situation has been the Bain of my existence. I have bought over 300 concealers - all of them aged my under eye making it look dry and crepey until I found the following products. I start with Sheiseido benefiance under eye cream. It's super rich. After it has soaked in a bit I put a tiny bit of the Sisley eye contour mask on top. This is expensive but amazing to use every night as well as under my concealer. I promise you will love this. If not - you can return it. Sisley takes returns and everything else I'm going mention can be bought at Sephora and can also be returned if you don't like it. Next I do my eye makeup and my base avoiding foundation on the under eye. Then add another light layer of the Shiseido eye cream. For concealer I mix Kulfi main match concealer in Rose rush with Charlotte tilbury beautiful skin concealer in shade 8 and blend it first with my fingers the a brush - then fingers again. It lays beautifully under the eyes. With all of those steps I am for the first time in my life able to use powder to set my eye concealer both over and under my eyes. ( I don't use the Sisley mask on my eyelids if I'm wearing makeup. Nighttime yes - but for eyeshadow I just use the Shiseido benefiance with concealer). Once the concealer is blended I immediately set with Huda easy bake loose powder. I use pound cake or pound cake mixed with the light peach. This combo lasts all day without cracking and scaling and it actually covers dark circles wellie making my wrinkles look less noticeable rather than worse as most concealers do. 3. Eyeshadow - I have to use a bright light colour on the lid. Then a light brown in the crease and a darker brown in the outer corner. I also use a highlighter in the inner corner and just on the very inner part of the lid. The one I use is no longer available but a close second is benefit tickle? I think. There are two shades cookie and tickle - the pink gold one is not good. There is a lighter shade that is described as being lighter and more silver which I normally wouldn't think is good for me. I initially purchased the pink gold one and that was a mistake. Sorry - I forgot which is which atm. The eyeshadow pallette that suits me best is the Charlotte Tilbury exagger eyes quad. The key with that is to use your finger or a dense bush to pick up the lighter lid shade and your finger to apply the sparkle shade just in the centre of your lid to the outer corner. You really need to work your finger into the sparkle shade to warm it up and then apply it....

Whether it is wearing a baggy salwar with a t-shirt and scarf like Geet in 'Jab We Met', or one-shoulder kameez like Poo from 'Kabhi Khushi Kabhi Gham'. Even the Anarkali suit named after the dancer herself in 'Mughal-e-Azam', chiffon sharis, and double-layered salwar kameez all made their rounds through the silver screen to wardrobes of the general public. When we see these clothes, we get nostalgic for that era. In the 2025 film 'Utshob', audiences got a throwback to 90s fashion through the outfits worn by Jesmine, played by actress Sadia Ayman. Keep updated, follow The Business Standard's Google news channel Throughout the film, Jesmine's wardrobe felt like flipping through an old family photo album where cousins, sisters, and neighbors once posed in pastel salwars with lace trims or bright red churidars under the winter sun. One of the earlier looks shows her in a soft baby pink salwar kameez with delicate embroidery. The orna is draped simply across her neck, the sleeves modest, and the fabric light. This is a look many Bangladeshis would immediately recognise from the 90s, worn during visits to the public library or coaching classes. The hair is half-pinned, makeup being just eyeliner and light lipstick, radiating young innocence. There's no attempt to modernise it with unnecessary updates—it's authentically untouched. Another standout look is her mint green and sky blue outfit. With its slightly flared cut and shiny border, it captures the youthful energy of the time. Girls wore similar looks on Eid mornings or school and college events. What makes this styling impressive is how it walks the line between memory and fiction. It doesn't feel like just another costume, but a reminder of a time where we dressed up the same. A more mature version of Jesmine is seen in a lacey blue suit. Lace was a favourite texture back then, especially during special occasions. The neckline is elegant but not experimental, while her voluminous hair and light blush shows she likes to keep it simple but not dull. ""Jesmine's style evolution reflects not just her wardrobe, but her emotional arc. We used colours to match her mood. When she's happy or in love, the clothes are brighter. But as her situation changes, her wardrobe slowly shifts too,"" shared costume designer Tania Rahman. When Jesmine appears in red, it marks a turning point. The red salwar kameez she wears isn't over the top because the colour is loud. The bright colour, scalloped edges, and embroidered detail are familiar: not flashy, just festive. Her hair, softly waved and side-parted, reflects how many young women styled themselves for special occasions back then. Her makeup is slightly bolder too, a deeper lip colour and defined eyes but still coy, like someone who wants to look grown-up without going overboard. It's a realistic, emotional moment in her journey, not just a costume change, and it fits naturally into the story. ""We looked at a lot of 90s Bollywood films while designing Jesmine's looks. Actresses like Juhi Chawla and Madhuri Dixit were big references. We made sure the cuts and colours matched that time while keeping the clothes true to Jesmine's character,"" said the costume designer. ""Tanim Noor is a perfectionist,"" she added. ""Every detail mattered to him from the neckline of a kameez to how an orna was draped. It pushed all of us to really think through every look and make sure it fit both the story and the time period."" ""This vision really came to life because of the whole team,"" she continued. ""Shafique, our makeup artist, kept everything very natural. We didn't want heavy makeup, just the kind of soft, real look girls had back then. It helped the costumes feel even more believable."" What 'Utshob' gets right is that it does not overdo nostalgia. The outfits feel sincere. There's no exaggeration, no over-accessorising. Each fabric, drape, and cut seems thoughtfully chosen to reflect the everyday glamour of that decade. In an age when 'retro' is often equated with loud, mismatched styling, 'Utshob' offers a simple, beautiful reminder of what fashion used to look like for real girls growing up in 90s Bangladesh."
1lg22er,2025-06-20 11:52:42,en,REDDIT,"  **Hi Charolette,** You are absolutely my favorite, and I look forward to your videos every single day. You're my travel buddy, my work buddy—whether I'm commuting, cooking, or cleaning, your videos are always playing. Thank you for making me feel seen and heard through your content. I wanted to share a little of my own story. Trust me when I say this is just the tip of the iceberg,  I'm from India, where mothers-in-law have quite the reputation—but I thought I had lucked out with mine. I believed we could be friends. But as our wedding got closer, I realized how wrong I was. She constantly instigated my father-in-law to fight with my parents over every single wedding decision. While he was the loud one, she was behind the scenes feeding the narrative that the groom's side was “superior.” My husband and I had dated for six years, and he had warned me about their toxic behavior—but I naïvely brushed it off. Dress shopping was a nightmare. I had a breakdown in the middle of a busy shopping street before I could finally settle on a dress. Two days before the wedding, both families had a major blowout—we were this close to calling it off. But I didn't want the actual day to be ruined too. Because my husband is Protestant and I'm Roman Catholic, we decided to honor both our faiths and have weddings in both churches. The morning of the first wedding (his church), I was up by 4 a.m., got ready, and arrived on time. He was 25 minutes late to his own wedding—even though he lived 2 km away, and I had traveled 13 km. Tradition dictates the groom's side arranges transport for the bride, but his parents refused. As if that wasn't enough, my MIL showed up wearing a blush pink gown nearly identical to mine. I let it go—there was still another ceremony and a reception ahead with 1,000 guests. I wasn't going to let her steal my peace. After the first ceremony, my husband and I went to our hotel to freshen up for the next wedding at 3 p.m. At 2:45, we were ready to leave, only to realize his parents hadn't shown up. We assumed they'd go directly to the church. Turns out, they were still on their way—because my MIL wanted to stop at the hotel, have lunch, and change outfits (yes, she had a second look). I, meanwhile, was wearing the same dress. They arrived 20 minutes late. And we couldn't start without them, because in our culture, the groom ties a sacred chain (called a *thali*) to the bride. We had exchanged rings at his church and planned to do the *thali* ceremony at mine. Since they brought the *thali*, we were forced to remove our wedding rings on the very same day we exchanged them—which broke our hearts. Still, the second ceremony was beautiful. We rushed to get ready for the reception. But our car got stuck in traffic. Since we were late, we asked if we could use the car his parents had rented—but my MIL threw a tantrum. So there we were, all dressed up, stranded on a busy street, while they sat in the car and left us behind on our wedding day. Thank God, our car arrived just a few minutes later. But at the reception, my MIL showed up wearing—again—the exact same color as my gown (I bought mine first, so there was no coincidence), and hers was more heavily embellished. There wasn't a single moment she didn't try to upstage me. Now she acts like nothing happened, as if she did nothing wrong. **Oh—and one last thing:** my parents covered most of the wedding expenses *“because we're the bride's side.” * My brother-in-law and his friends overstayed in the hotel rooms, ordered room service, and left without paying—leaving my parents to cover the bills."

Without thought of the consequences, man-kind used it to every advantage, winning the war and sending Anagovia into an age of peace and prosperity. Weavers grabbed hold of the Threads of reality and shaped them to their will. They are considered by most to be a blessing from the gods themselves.

One night while she's setting up camp, a young Weaver named Hashkan stumbles in and throws her careful plans off course.

This ending, unlike all the others, is solidly not for those who are currently sensitive or unable to handle emotional, disturbing content. I have never, in my life, written something this distressing before, and it is not an easy read. If you're looking to get off, one of the other endings to this choose your own adventure would do a much better job, because this ending is a disconcerting, gut wrenching story that was written to characterize Powder and begin developing him and his story. Long story short, I warned you. If this makes you feel sad or disgusted or uncomfortable, I warned you. Dead doves and all that. Content Warnings for: >! Cock vore, death, digestion, angst, trauma, sex, sexual coersion! < “I-I think being treated like royalty probably sounds nice…” you mumble, seemingly nervous to admit you'd like to be pampered. That's so silly of you, most everyone enjoys a little worship every now and again! There's no shame in a little self-care ♥ “Oh, sweet thing, of course it sounds nice, because it will be~!” “y-yeah?” you ask, almost in disbelief that there's no catch. Aside from your impending death, of course, though my goal is to hopefully divert that more towards being the last thing on your mind as we spend time together tonight. “Absolutely, sweetheart. In fact, you're going to get some very special treatment tonight! Our itinerary is bursting at the seams, in fact, so it would be prudent to get a move on!” I announce to you as I crouch down, holding two arms out in a somewhat bizarre looking way. “U-uh… what are you… doing…?” You ask me, a question that's met with a soft chuckle and a slow shake of my head. “Lay in my arms, dearest guest~! It would be rather undistinguished of me to expect you to leap to the floor on your own! You, my friend, are not going to be lifting a single finger on your own behalf tonight.” Your cheeks red and your heart thoroughly jumpstarted, you step next to my arms and sit in my grasp as I offer you a warm expression and step down to the floor as steadily as I can, letting your legs down to hit the floor very gently. “Our agenda does, in fact, include far more than a simple conversation and consumption! We need to get you ready!” I walk backwards until I'm directly in front of the bedroom door, then knock on it a couple of times with the back of my fist. “Oh, Powder, love! Would you mind opening the door for me and my lovely guest~?” I call out. We immediately hear a quick stumble, followed by a barely audible 'whoopsy!' before some footsteps thump up to the door and the lock turns. You tilt your head, your eyes wide, confused as to why I would ever allow you freedom, but you are confused. I am not allowing you freedom. The rest of the house is locked up tight, still. The windows, the exits, any sort of room we don't want you to have access to. “I will be showing you to your destinations throughout the night, and I will be accompanying you every step of the way, to ensure you have the best night of your life.” The door opens, and standing behind me with her intimidating silhouette, is my partner, Powder, a six-foot-two purple, pink, and white dairy cow with cute piercings and clothes that hardly fit her. Her choice! There are clothes she could wear just fine, but no! She always buys things that cling to her like tape! They look gorgeous on her, but when she moves the wrong way, they snap like reeds… ah, silly me, I'm going off on a tangent! Apologies. “Is there, like, anything else you need me to do, Silky?” Powder asks, leaning down a bit to look at me at eye level. Her tail swings around in an excited wagging motion, like she enjoyed being useful. “Oh, not now, sweetheart...."

mov_815EE80DE2F8A5C60074B94D05EA9895,2025-06-21 03:40:14,en,WEB,"  The '90s are back—and not just in playlists and Instagram filters. From iconic fashion revivals to moody makeup tones, the light grunge aesthetic is taking center stage. But here's the twist: we're adding a boho-chic edge with vintage embroidered kaftans. It's the ultimate blend of rebellious cool and carefree elegance. If you're into the laid-back, edgy vibes of the '90s and want to elevate it with artisanal flair, here's how to pull off this trend with confidence—featuring beautiful embroidered kaftans from Mogul Interior, where vintage meets modern in the most effortless way. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-wGpzDopuq8         Step 1: Light Grunge Makeup—Soft Meets Sultry     Let's start with makeup. The essence of the light grunge look lies in its imperfect beauty—think moody yet minimal. Foundation: Go matte and natural. Use a foundation that smooths out your complexion without a dewy finish. This creates that flat, velvety canvas so iconic to the '90s. Brows: Channel your inner Winona Ryder with thinner, more arched brows. Use a precise brow pencil to shape and soften without overdefining. Eyes: Reach for cool-toned palettes—matte grays, taupes, and soft charcoals. Blend softly across the lid with a subtle shimmer in the center for depth. Liner: Grunge is never perfect. Smudge your eyeliner (black or espresso brown) across the lash line for that “slept-in” look. Use a cotton swab to blur the edges. Mascara: Load up both upper and lower lashes to make the eyes pop, but skip the false lashes—natural is key. Lips: Matte lips in muted mauves, brick reds, or deep coffee browns are your go-to. Use a lip pencil all over for that long-lasting, transfer-proof pout. Blush: Keep it understated with a cool-toned pink or dusty rose swept across the cheeks. You want just enough to warm up the complexion. Find Us On Amazon Mogul Gallery Collection    Step 2: Embrace the Mood with Retro Embroidered Kaftans     To balance out the edgy grunge tones, bring in texture and personality with retro embroidered kaftans from Mogul Interior. These pieces are more than fashion—they're a celebration of craftsmanship and self-expression. Look for Details: Choose kaftans that feature intricate floral embroidery, tribal stitching, or geometric motifs. These designs channel a nostalgic bohemian aesthetic with a handcrafted twist. Color Play: Pair your makeup with earthy tones—mustard, rust, olive—or cool hues like slate blue, steel gray, or icy lavender. These complement your grunge-inspired palette beautifully. Versatility is Key: Kaftans are the ultimate throw-on piece. Wear them over ripped jeans, denim shorts, or belt them up as standalone dresses for an effortlessly bold look. Accessorize: Think vintage! Layered coin necklaces, statement rings, and old-school hoop earrings bring the look together. Don't be afraid to mix metals and textures. Step 3: Complete the Look with Hair & Attitude     Hair: The messier, the better. Tousled waves, bedhead buns, or even half-up, half-down with a velvet scrunchie give you that undone '90s charm. A middle part keeps it on-brand. Accessories: Add chokers, leather cuffs, or a bandana tied loosely around your neck. Finish with round sunglasses or tinted lenses for that perfect flashback moment. Confidence is Non-Negotiable: The '90s weren't just about fashion—they were about attitude. Own your look, mix high and low, and embrace the power of individuality. https://in.pinterest.com/mogulinterior/     Final Word: Nostalgia Meets Artisanal Fashion     Grunge meets glam. Edgy meets earthy. And it all works when you make it your own.

Roses (Rosa) are a classic and instantly recognisable plant, ideal for almost every style of garden. They flower abundantly from early summer in a choice of colours including pastel shades of pink, peach, cream or snowy-white; vibrant yellow and gold; orange, crimson or red. Many roses are fragrant and some types flower in one flush of blooms while others flower all summer long. Some have colourful fruits (hips) and the plants come in a range of forms, from traditional shrubs and climbers to miniature plants for patio containers. Rose tess of the D'urbervilles. Roses have upright, arching, scrambling or trailing, usually prickly stems. Their leaves are glossy and mid to dark green but occasionally grey-green. Flowers vary in shape and include flat, cupped, rounded, urn-shaped, button-eye, pompon and rosette. Three of the stunners in my garden are pictured above. Macmillan Nurse is a superb creamy white rose, with very double rosette type blooms, that flowers from June to November (though earlier flower buds sometimes appear a peachy colour). It has lovely glossy dark grey-green foliage and makes a handsome addition to any garden, mine was a gift from Macmillan Cancer Support for the charity fundraising I do. It is a modern shrub rose, one of a large assortment of mostly more modern hybrids of very mixed ancestry. It is best pruned very lightly in the first year, reducing stems by no more than a third. In subsequent years, growths can be reduced by up to a half to leave a beautifully shapely plant. Rose Macmillan Nurse In the late 1940s, David C H Austin set out on his quest to breed the most beautiful and healthy roses. One such rose was Tess of the d'Urbervilles which always looks beautiful in my garden. However, as a result of their review process, Tess of the d'Urbervilles has now been retired from their English Rose Collection but remains part of their history, paving the way for many more new roses to come, creating the next generation of roses. Such a shame as I love it! Rose Susie The third rose pictured is an absolute gem of a rose. Susie boasts the wonderful perfume and satisfying colour that make climbing roses such a welcome addition to any garden. Go on a journey of colour with this climbing rose, starting with a reddish bud, which opens up with yellow and golden shades in early summer, then taking on a pink and blush colour as they fade, and the petals fall. The remarkable colours are even more eye-popping as they contrast so well against the dark green, healthy, and glossy foliage. This repeat-flowering variety will continue to burst to life through summer and autumn. Not just a delight for the eyes, 'Susie' also produces a sweet strong lemony perfume that fills the air around wherever it is planted, making your summertime garden strolls even more pleasant. For best impact in your garden, consider growing this variety in large pots or directly in the soil. The National Garden Scheme has some beautiful gardens to visit this weekend. You could join a trail of 5 gardens in Bexhill on Sea or a group of 3 brand new gardens in Steyning today, Saturday. Meanwhile tomorrow, Sunday, Steyning gardens open again along with a group of 7 pretty gardens on the Herstmonceux Parish trail, then in Seaford there is a trail of 8 gardens opening in the town. You can find all the details on these and many more gardens opening at . One you won't find in the Sussex Booklet however, is a pop up opening for Butlers Farmhouse in Butlers Lane Herstmonceux on Wednesday 25th June. Open from 2pm to 5pm with entry £5. Geoff (center) with first visitors. My first visitors to the garden were a group of 35 from Winchelsea at the end of last month. Although technically not open until the 16th June this year, due to my knee surgery, the visit had been pre booked for many months and as they were not requiring refreshments, I let the visit go ahead! Sadly, the weather was not great and it was a little on the cool side with a little drizzle! You can see me holding court in the centre of the garden, as they wandered around, taking it all in. A very pretty flower at this time of the year along my drive is the stunning red, oriental poppy. It is a perennial growing up to 90cm high, with bristly stems and finely divided, dark green leaves covered with silvery hairs. In early to mid-summer, it produces pendant buds that straighten and open to large, bowl-shaped, orange-red flowers to 15cm across, with small purple-black blotches at the base of the petals.

At $21, Strapsicle is an easy and affordable Kindle accessory to make your reading experience even more comfortable. If you prefer more ergonomic grips or don't like the look of straps across the back of your Kindle, an alternative security option may be best. apr / 2025 For a limited time save up to 50% on Strapsicle gear at Strapsicle's website in celebration of the brand's birthday. Snag select pairs of Kindle straps for as low as $9 (save $10). If you're adventuring on summer travels in the upcoming months, now is the perfect time to grab my favorite Kindle accessory, especially if you're a voracious reader. Let me explain. If you're an avid e-reader like me (or even if you're new to the Kindle world), you probably quickly figured out how uncomfortable it can be to use the e-reader. That's not because my Kindle Paperwhite is bad, but because it's sometimes hard to find the perfect position for optimal reading enjoyment. Kindles do not have built-in support, making reading in bed, at the pool, at the beach, or anywhere a lot more challenging, especially if you like to read lying down or at odd angles. Also: I switched to an e-paper Android phone with a physical keyboard - here's my buying advice And just like it's popular to outfit our smartphones with grips, rings, and other accessories for stability, it's quite en vogue to do the same for our other tech, including Kindles. After one too many times dropping my Kindle Paperwhite onto my face (that thing does, in fact, leave a mark), I finally caved and was seriously in the market for a grip system. During my journey, I encountered some of the usual accessory contenders: traditional grips like PopSockets, cases that convert to stands, and large, clunky holders. But something else caught my eye -- Strapsicle. I stumbled upon them online. Strapsicle is a stability option created for e-readers like the Kindle and Kobo to ensure a comfortable grip when you read, and a secure hold for your Kindle when you're not (you know, like when you fall asleep with the device in your hand). Strapsicles are simple silicone pieces that pop over the corners of your device and create a strap to handle your Kindle securely. Also: Select Prime members can get Kindle Unlimited for 3 months at no cost - here's how So, where had this accessory been all my life? The answer is that Strapsicle has a large cult following of users, many derived from BookTok, but the accessory hasn't quite made it mainstream. But that situation may be about to change. In 2024, the Australian-based brand sealed a $250,000 deal on Shark Tank Australia. Since I initially wrote this review, I've been using Strapsicle on my Kindle for over six months. I now own multiple sets (like the Eggnog and Blush pink sets pictured in this article) and a matching Strapsicle silicone clutch. Here's why I'm a fan for life. The Strapsicle fits most e-readers, creates a secure grip, and adds a layer of protection. The accessory comes in several fun colors, including blush pink (pictured in this article), lilac, sage green, and more. The straps come in four sizes: small, medium, large, and Kindle Oasis, and a handy size chart makes it easy to match the right Strapsicle set with your respective e-reader model. Holding my Kindle Paperwhite upside down using both Strapsicles as support. Kayla Solino/ZDNET Since I have the Kindle Paperwhite 6.8-inch 11th Gen model, I purchased the large size. In the box, I received two silicone straps labeled ""top left"" and ""top right,"" which made it easy to set up my Kindle. Also: I replaced my Kindle with this E Ink tablet that runs Android - and don't regret it You can use both straps simultaneously or choose to only use one strap on your device, depending on your preference. I tested both approaches, and I prefer having both straps on, especially since the silicone corners add some protection, too. Having a Strapsicle allows me to place my hand wherever I want on my Kindle without worrying about security. This feature is why I chose to try this strap model instead of more conventional methods, like a PopSocket, which can only be fastened in one spot. I can flip my Kindle upside down and all around, and it doesn't budge. PopSocket vs. Strapsicle Before I dive in, let me say that I am not anti-PopSocket. I enjoyed using a PopSocket on my iPhone throughout my teens, but once I began working at ZDNET, it became increasingly impractical to continue using one on my phone. I spent a lot of time testing MagSafe accessories, and it became annoying to change cases every time I tested products. I also didn't love using a PopSocket enough to purchase a newer MagSafe version. All that said, a PopSocket was still my first thought when considering a grip for my Kindle. According to Reddit, PopSockets are widely used by avid readers on their devices. They're an affordable and personable option for adding a grip to your Kindle. I do see the appeal...."

Find some eyeshadow placement YouTube videos for hooded eyes, it'll be a game changer - the sort of all over the lid shadow you are doing now isn't flattering on hooded eyes which naturally happens with age and ends up making you look more outdated and tired. I agree with others that the pulled back hair isn't working for your face shape, but 'adding volume to your hair' is not very helpful advice, lol (I'm also in my 40's), but I do think that coloring your hair and trying something different like cool brunette or caramel low lights and bangs could work out for you - splurge on a good stylist/colorist - maybe do a couple consultation visits to get different ideas from professionals."

mov_774550713D51CB2908A8F9F329A79C84,2025-06-25 00:22:12,en,WEB,"  The ex-journalist will marry Jeff Bezos in a multi-million dollar wedding ceremony in Venice An innocuous-seeming paparazzi photograph may have inadvertently revealed details about Lauren Sanchez's fiercely-guarded bridal look, as the former journalist prepares to say 'I do' to Jeff Bezos this week. A tour guide hired to welcome guests as they arrived in Venice for the $20 million wedding of the Amazon founder Bezos, 61, and Lauren, 55, was snapped holding a clipboard of names. Prominent among Beatrice Bavato's list - that included names, flight numbers, and hotel destinations - were members of Lauren's 'glam squad'. This included the hair and make-up staff of Buster Knight as well as Laura Mele and Sophie Gutterman, both of whom styled Lauren before her recent space trip. A look back at their work for Lauren - who has recruited the trio for everything from red carpet appearances to award ceremonies and fashion shows - reveals the Emmy-winner never strays too far from her signature look: a flawless complexion and smokey eye, with loose waves framing her face. And it appears they'll be recreating Lauren's show-stopping glam for the wedding of the decade - set to be attended by tech moguls, Hollywood stars, and politicians. A curveball addition to her team appears to be Mindy L'amour, a California-based fashion stylist who works with drag queens and specialises in corsets. Given Lauren has worn the form-fitting garment on several occasions, including her recent bachelorette party, Mindy may be on hand to style a custom corset for the not-so-blushing bride-to-be. But the most intriguing of the ancillary guests is Samuel Horowitz, a sales executive at Dolce & Gabbana. Could the young Milan-based associate's presence be confirmation that Lauren has opted to wear one of their creations for her wedding ceremony? As the list also suggested the bride's first-choice nail artist was a 'no show', here's everything we know about Lauren's wedding look - and the A-team she's put together to bring it to life: Laura Mele, Lauren's trusted makeup artist Laura Ann Mele has been part of Lauren's glam squad since at least November 2023, when the former newscaster first appeared on the New York-based bridal makeup artist's Instagram page. At the time, Laura dolled her up for Glamour magazine's Women of the Year awards, when Lauren opted for a soft, sultry look that enhanced her features without being overbearing. Laura, who arrived in Venice on June 24, has recreated this 'babydoll' glam look on the future wife of Jeff Bezos multiple times - including for her 53rd birthday party, multiple award ceremonies, and Lauren's debut Met Gala appearance in 2024 - since then. Most recently, Laura did Lauren's makeup before she shot off into space with Katy Perry, broadcast journalist Gayle King, ex-NASA scientist Aisha Bowe, bioastronautics research scientist Amanda Nguyen, and film producer Kerriane Flynne on Bezos' space tourism rocket Blue Origin. And it's no surprise, since Lauren's go-to makeup look is the embodiment of Laura's specialty. According to her website, Laura - whose roster of high-profile clients includes Kim Kardashian and Emily Ratakajowski - is particularly skilled at creating customised looks that 'enhance your natural beauty'. After years of practice - and just in time for what is shaping up to be Laura's most important wedding yet - it seems likely she will give Lauren an elevated, luxe version of her signature 'babydoll' style - with a light nude lip and a hint of gloss, a black smokey eye, feathery lashes, and a hint of pale pink blush. Buster Knight, makeup artist to the stars It appears the Albuquerque native, soon to become Mrs Bezos, has assembled a bridal glam squad full of heavyweights - including A-list celebrity makeup artist Buster Knight. The London-based creative documented his flight out of the United Kingdom on Instagram ealier this morning before the leaked spreadsheet confirmed Buster's arrival in Italy around lunchtime. In the past, he has recreated Lauren's trademark makeup look for several high-profile appearances - including at the Cannes Film Festival in May and the Dolce & Gabbana Alta Moda show in Sardinia last July. While breaking down her look for the design house's fall/winter show at Milan Fashion Week last January, Buster shared he used Hourglass Cosmetics' lipstick in the shade 'Dove 306' as well as a Kylie Cosmetics mascara over fake lashes from UK-based brand Eyelure to achieve Lauren's look. Buster - whose superstar clients include Kris Jenner, Simone Ashley, and Priyanka Chopra Jonas - previously also revealed the exact product list he uses to achieve Lauren's 'peaches and cream' complexion. According to The Telegraph, Lauren's go-to is Armani Beauty's Luminous Silk Foundation and Concealer that retail for £47 and £30 respectively. Sophie Rose, Lauren's hairstylist The woman behind Lauren's big, bouncy hair that falls in perfect waves - whether she's on ground or shuttling through space in a rocket - is Sophie Rose. As a long-standing member of Lauren's glam squad, it was no surprise to see the California native's name on the leaked spreadsheet of guests arriving in Venice ahead of what is expected to be one of the most lavish weddings in recent times. Lauren appears consistently on Sophie's Instagram portfolio, including in March when the celebrity hairdresser shared a picture of Lauren's 'bridal' look for the Vanity Fair's Oscars party that she attended with her beau Bezos. For the occasion, the ex-journalist picked a formfitting, strapless white gown, complete with a feathered hem and train, that screamed 'bride-to-be'. Her waist-length locks were, unsurprisingly, styled in glamorous waves - a style Sophie might reinvent for the wedding. Mindy L'amour, fashion stylist Perhaps the most surprising name on the spreadsheet is Mindy L'amour, a Californian stylist who dresses drag queens and specialises in bespoke corsets - a garment Lauren has a well-documented fondness for. In fact, they're a key part of her revamped look as the future Mrs Bezos in the years after she first met and fell in love with the Amazon tycoon. Lauren has styled corsets for a number of VIP events, including US President Trump's inauguration in January when she wore a plunging white lace design under her Alexander McQueen pantsuit. She later brushed away the criticism her risque outfit was 'inappropriate' for the event, as a source close to Lauren reportedly told Page Six: 'She does what she wants.' Considering Lauren also picked a plunging white corset for her star-studded bachelorette party in Paris, which was attended by Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, and Eva Longoria, it might be that Mindy has been recruited to style the garment for one of her bridal looks. The stylist shared a video of herself enjoying a water taxi ride upon arrival in Venice earlier today, but did not caption the short clip. Samuel Horowitz, Dolce & Gabbana executive One of the most exciting names on the list is Sam Horowitz, whose LinkedIn revealed he works as a full-time sales executive at Dolce & Gabbana. Could his presence be confirmation that Lauren has decided to wear D&G on her big day? Certainly this wouldn't be a huge surprise as the mother-of-three is known to be a fan of the Italian label - not least since they gave nepo baby modelling work to her 24-year-old son Nikko last year. It comes after Lauren and Jeff were spotted at D&G's iconic store in Milan for what appeared to be a dress-fitting in March. As they left the shop, the couple were followed by an employee carrying white garment bags that may have contained their wedding outfits..."
mzm8hn0,2025-06-25 01:05:57,en,REDDIT,"  OK I don't usually comment on these kind of posts but want to do so here. One thing that really bothers me is when replies say things like 'you're so pretty, you don't need anything' when the person is asking for advice. So I'll start with yes, you can add some inexpensive things to improve your long term and short term confidence. First, sunscreen. Every day, on your face and take it down your neck and onto the top of your chest. That's a nonnegotiable. Treat your neck like you treat your face. I use EltaMD uv clear 46. It's a little more expensive than your budget so just find something at Walmart that's specifically for daytime use on your face. Next, a nighttime moisturizer. I like gel moisturizers and Walmart carries many that are inexpensive and they can last a while. Next, teeth whitening strips. You can put these on while getting the kids ready in the morning and multitask. I use Lumineux from Amazon. I saw a suggestion here for Crest white strips but those are too zingy feeling and irritate my teeth. Those three things are a good start and you can fit them into your stated budget. Finally, budget some money for a light tinted serum and a light pink cream blush. These two things are easy to apply in no time and they'll help you feel put together. And they will allow your true beauty to continue to show. You look very full of joy and you don't want to cover that up. If you want to do a mascara, I suggest a brown instead of black, and curl your lashes first."

Don't look elsewhere; these are the best!"" —Adrian Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in six styles and three sizes). 2. E.l.f.'s Hydrating Core Lip Shine in the ""Ecstatic"" shade, which reviewers say captures the some magic as ""Black Honey,"" the $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique that's blowing up on TikTok at a fraction of the price. It doesn't shift colors as magically as the other version, but it's a perfect, nonsticky ""go-to"" lip to keep in all your favorite bags this summer. I personally will live, breathe, and die by the magic of $25 ""universal"" Black Honey version — it lasts FOREVER and also functions as the perfect blush — but it sells out so often that I am also deeply relieved to know it has a cheap alternative in case of lip emergency! Promising review: ""I absolutely love this product. The dark color is perfectly sheer. It also adds the most beautiful color to your lips. I am a Clinique Black Honey lip fan, and this gives me the same look for a fraction of the cost. I love it and have several that I keep in various spots. Not sticky either, which is my biggest gripe about lip glosses. My hair doesn't get stuck in this like some glosses, but I get the shine."" —Hamps5 Get it from Amazon for $7 (also available in four other shades). 3. A NeeDoh ""Dream Drop,"" the latest drop from the *elite* Needoh sensory fidget toy line for anyone who wants to add more calm and focus to their day. This goo-filled, delightfully colorful fidget has a satisfying squish with a ""slow rise"" before going back to its original shape. Reviewers also love that it doesn't have the kind of stickiness that picks up debris and makes it hard to clean. Schylling is a small business that specializes in modern and retro toys, games, and sets. Promising review: ""Great, and I love that it has a tray to sit on. I love how firm this is to squeeze, and the slow release is really relaxing. The included dish is a great touch — it keeps it clean and gives it a dedicated spot to rest."" —AZMOM Get it from Amazon for $7.10 (the color is either blue, pink, or purple and gets selected for you at random)! Check out the rest of the Needoh fidget toy options on their Amazon storefront! 4. A Baccarat Rouge 540-inspired moisturizing body wash infused with white jasmine, red currant, and sweet amber that reviewers swear by for a cheap alternative to keep that delectably luxe scent on them all day long. Nothing wrong with smelling a lil' ~~expensive~~! I bought this after being peer-pressured by all the lovely reviews and I'm happy to report it lives up to the hype. The scent is lovely — it has depth with a hint of floral, but it's light and not at all overpowering. My favorite thing about it is how easily it pairs with other scents, because I am a body mist gremlin who swaps out her scents every day. The lather is also deeply satisfying and I feel quite refreshed and squeaky clean without ever feeling dry. Promising review: ""Cremo's body wash is nothing short of exceptional. If you're a fan of luxurious fragrances, this product will quickly become your new favorite. It boasts an incredible scent that perfectly mimics Baccarat Rouge 540 — a fragrance renowned for its sophisticated and captivating aroma. What sets this body wash apart is not just its stunning scent but also its longevity. The fragrance lingers beautifully throughout the day, ensuring you stay enveloped in that luxurious aroma long after your shower."" —Ralph D. Thompson II Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in three scents). 5. A two-slice slim toaster to fit virtually *anywhere* in your tiny kitchen, and to look gosh darn adorable doing it...."
mzokvl1,2025-06-25 11:58:49,en,REDDIT,"  Oh boy! Right plant, wrong place. First three are not good #2 is your biggest issue. No sun after noon. Especially with a newly planted hydrangea which needs to get established first before they can perform like they should. It is under extreme stress. Your hydrangeas are burning, and getting heat stroke. The white fence also reflects heat onto the shrub. Now is not the time to transplant. So first issue, go to hardware store and get some tall plant stakes - those tall green metal stakes or bamboo ones - and purchase a bolt of shade cloth from store if they have it, if not get [some 50% shade cloth](https://a.co/d/fnjKgJG) from Amazon (it comes in different lengths and they sell higher end materials if you want to spend that - but stretch that over the tops of the stakes, secure with clips and that will help break up the sun and the heat. I wouldn't go too whole hog on $$ because I recommend you move these later. Fall or spring - spring being the best of the two. Or purchase some inexpensive beach umbrellas to shade/shield the area. If you look on the sub, people are posting photos. Adjust your sprinklers. I have one lacecap on my property edge and my neighbor's irrigation hits it. On the good side it is loaded with lush blooms, on the downside, the leaves are loaded with fungal leaf spot. The neighbors care about their sod more than they do with my hydrangea! Only water to touch hydrangea leaves should be rain water. We get our hearts set on seeing a certain look but if it is not the right location for the plant, then there is no changing that reality. Depending on where you live and how many hours of sun this does get, there may be other hydrangea choices - ones that are pink (Incrediball blush or Mini Mauvette) both native, or certain panicles that start out white and age in cooler zones to pink and rose hues. I would replant these in early spring to a shadier location of your home. Prepare the hole wide and big and add in soil amendments and especially Espoma BioTone Starter - which I 100% use anytime I am digging anything up and transplanting. The product has not failed me anytime I am working with roots that are disturbed from being dug up."

However, Billboard may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes. Shoppers, get excited. Amazon Prime Day 2025 is almost here. While the annual sales event doesn't officially kick off until July 8, there are already great deals to be had on all things beauty. From pigmented concealer, easy-to-use sunscreen, liquid blush and playful pimple patches, early deals up to 50% off can be shopped in a slew of products from top brands such as SHEGLAM, Kosas, NYX , Saie and so much more. Get ahead of the curve and shop some of our favorite picks on Amazon before they're gone for good. SHEGLAM Color Bloom Liquid Blush in Shade On Point $6.99  $7.99  13% off    Buy Now On Amazon A bright pink liquid blush with a sponge applicator. Blendable and oh-so-pigmented, SHEGLAM's Color Bloom liquid blush is popular for a reason. Retailing for $6.99, the liquid flush comes in a matte finish with a medium but buildable coverage. It all happens thanks to the liquid blush's applicator, a wide doe foot saturated with product that you can dot onto your skin. Once applied, you can tap the blush out with your fingers or buff in with a fluffy brush for an airbrushed look. Color Bloom comes in a multitude of shades that work for all skin tones, but On Point is our fave. The muted rose petal-esque pink has neutral undertones that universally work to bring a wash of color to your cheeks. For a sunkissed look, we recommend dotting this blush on the cheekbones, chin and the bride of the nose. Kosas Revealer Concealer in Tone 10.5 N $6.50  $7.95  18% off    Buy Now On Amazon A fluid concealer with a doe foot applicator. If you're like me, your under eyes could use some help. Dark shadows under the eyes are a major concern for a lot of sleep-deprived folks. Unfortunately, they can also be a product of genetics. Whatever the case may be, you have nothing to fear — Kosas Revealer Concealer is here to save the day. Retailing for $6.50, this concealer is buildable and hydrating, brightening the under eyes seamlessly while leaving a skin-like finish. No caking here. Unlike traditional concealers, Kosas' formula is jam-packed with hyaluronic acid, a hydrating ingredient that reduces the risk of the concealer settling into fine lines. The concealer is further beefed up with help from caffeine and pink algae extract, ingredients that may brighten to leave the wearer looking youthful and wide awake. No coffee necessary. Kitsch Stainless Steel Gua Sha Facial Tool $9.58  $11.99  20% off    Buy Now On Amazon A stainless steel facial tool to de-puff. It's time to embrace the natural face you were given, enhancing your looks with natural tips and tricks. A good way to help reduce puffiness is with a gua sha tool. You know it works because gua sha — a healing therapy — has been used in beauty routines in China going back thousands of years. The scraping tool — which can be made of various hard materials such as stone and jade — has since been adapted to provide different benefits. Kitsch's gua sha tool is made of stainless steel, a material that works to cool and help depuff the skin. Stainless steel is also non-porous, meaning it won't harbor bacteria or moisture like would. This also means your products will absorb better. In general, gua sha tools are used to massage the body in tandem with an oil or moisturizer, promoting blood circulation and lymphatic drainage. Lymphatic drainage is just a fancy way of saying you're moving extra fluid from a swollen area into an area where the lymph nodes will work to drain said fluid. Tocobo Cotton Airy Sun Stick SPF 50 $17  $20  15% off    Buy Now On Amazon A stick sunscreen with SPF 50. It's heatwave season, which means protecting your skin, especially while on the go, can be a challenge. Tocobo Cotton Airy Sun Stick makes sunscreen application simple. No messy cream or spray, just swipe on and go. The SPF 50 formula is contained in a roll-up stick that glides on, leaving the skin with a matte finish sans the nasty white cast. A sunblock that reads “Broad-spectrum” simply means it protects the skin from both UVA and UVB rays. These pesky rays can cause skin cancer and premature aging if the skin is left unprotected...."

mov_6D8FBB4DB049FFCB2488DD503ECA9670,2025-06-25 18:23:40,en,WEB,"  In the world of interior design, the allure of a perfectly curated space often lies in the thoughtful ⁣interplay of various styles and periods. Imagine stepping into a room where a mid-century modern armchair stands proudly alongside a Victorian-era mirror, or⁣ where vibrant art deco accents mingle effortlessly ​wiht ⁢contemporary abstract paintings. This creative collision of‍ eras invites intrigue‍ and sparks conversation,⁣ transforming mere aesthetics into a ‍rich tapestry of history‍ and personality. By blending distinct time periods, we‍ not only breathe life into our living environments but also create narratives that reflect our personal journeys and evolving tastes. In this article, we explore the⁢ captivating reasons why ‍mixing eras in interior design leads to the most captivating, dynamic rooms-spaces ‍that are not⁣ just seen, but truly experienced. [embedded content] Embracing Contrast for Visual Dynamics In design, contrast serves as a⁣ powerful​ tool for ⁤creating visual interest and depth. When merging pieces from various ​eras, the juxtaposition of styles ⁤can lead to unexpected harmonies that stimulate the ⁢senses. Consider the interplay between sleek, modern furniture and ornate, vintage ‌decor. Each piece not only stands out on its own but also enhances⁣ the character⁤ of surrounding items, offering context and storytelling that a single era cannot accomplish. For example,pairing a mid-century modern side table ⁣with a Victorian armchair invites conversation,evoking a sense of eclectic charm that resonates with personal history and evolving aesthetics. To effectively embrace‍ contrast, you might focus on several ⁢key elements: Color palettes: Use complementary shades to bridge different styles. Textures: Mix smooth surfaces with layered fabrics for tactile variety. Shapes: Balance angular modern⁣ designs with soft, curved antique pieces. Are You Styling Your Coffee Table All Wrong? By thoughtfully curating a blend of styles, you create a space that transitions seamlessly between​ eras, displaying a narrative that resonates with both history and ⁣contemporary life. This approach not only makes a personal statement but also reflects a world where ⁢tradition and innovation coexist beautifully. [embedded content] The Art of Layering Textures‌ and Materials Successfully mixing various textures and materials ⁣is akin‌ to painting a masterpiece; it requires a keen understanding ​of how each element interacts while maintaining harmony. Begin by incorporating natural materials like wood, stone, and wool, which ground a space and provide warmth. Add in metal accents-think copper, brass, or matte black-to introduce a sleek contrast that invigorates the⁣ overall aesthetic. Layering different textures ⁤creates depth; ⁢such as, a smooth leather sofa can be softened with a chunky knit ​throw, while sleek glass lamps can balance rustic⁣ wooden side tables. This interplay encourages both visual interest⁢ and tactile ⁤delight. to elevate your space further, consider an array of vintage and modern pieces. The juxtaposition⁤ of styles-from an⁣ ornate antique mirror to a minimalist contemporary coffee table-tells a story while adding intrigue. Below is an example of​ how different elements⁤ can come together: Era Material Texture Mid-Century Modern Teak Wood Smooth Industrial Steel Rugged Art deco Marble Glossy bohemian Cotton Textured by thoughtfully integrating these various textures and materials, you can achieve⁣ a rich layered look that is not only pleasing to the eye but also pulls the entire‌ room⁢ together⁤ into ⁢a cohesive narrative. Each element contributes‌ its own personality, creating a unique environment filled with character and ⁢charm. Creating a Timeless Narrative ⁢through Decor Intriguing spaces ⁤frequently enough tell stories woven from various periods,⁣ creating a rich tapestry that captivates the eye‌ and sparks conversation. Incorporating elements from different eras​ adds layers of complexity and depth,transforming a simple room into a past narrative. By thoughtfully selecting decor pieces⁢ that coexist in harmony, you ‍can showcase contrasting ‌styles in a cohesive manner...."

The craft store giant, which recently purchased the defunct Joann's IP, has stocked its shelves with its “Summerween” collections, complete with cute ghost, witch, and other detective decor, four months before Halloween. And not only that, customers will have the chance to purchase five unique “Summerween” collections. Currently in stores are the nostalgic “Sweet and Spooky” line featuring pink, sparkly decor and -inspired items like the “Boo Book” vase, and the more traditional “Trick or Treat” collection, full of classic ghost and pumpkin decorations. Three more collections are set to launch soon: the dark and moody “Dead Regency” and cosmic-themed “Iridescent Moon” arrive July 25, while an -inspired line debuts August 15. The premature setups sparked lots of online chatter, including one TikTok showing off this year's items. “Summer literally hasn't started yet,” one viewer noted about the clip posted on June 11, over a week before the official first day of summer on June 20. Lots of people were also frightened by the preppy pink collection. “I will die on this hill, BUT, pink is NOT Halloween!!! I said what I said. Lol,” one person wrote. “Please, no more pink or sparkle or glitter…. Enough already. I want black and orange vintage style,” another begged. Even Halloween enthusiasts weren't happy to see the seasonal decor already in stock. “This is way too early and way too bright... and I'm saying this as someone with a Halloween tattoo. It's still wrong,” someone wrote. “Can't do the bright colors. Morticia would not approve lol,” another referenced the beloved character from . “They took the scariest holiday and made it foo foo. Next, Freddy's shirt will have blush and bashful stripes, and his hands [will be made] out of cupcakes. ,” they added. One viewer even mourned the thought of their first Halloween without Joann. “This is why I miss Joann. Their Halloween stuff was so good and none of it was pink,” they wrote."

mov_3DA207610A0FD0449AFA39A579D07E78,2025-06-27 13:11:27,en,WEB,"  There was never a doubt that there would be plenty of celebrities at the Venice, Italy wedding of Lauren Sánchez and Jeff Bezos—but, unexpectedly, there is real-life royalty present, too. Queen Rania of Jordan arrived in Venice on June 26, joined by her son Crown Prince Hussein, his wife Princess Rajwa, and their baby daughter Princess Iman. Rania wore casual all-black upon arrival, and later Thursday evening changed into Fendi couture. Many of the guests arriving to Lauren Sánchez and Jeff Bezos's glamorous Venice wedding are the usual suspects—Kim Kardashian, Oprah Winfrey, and the A-list like. But there was an unexpected royal family represented at the wedding of the year, led by Queen Rania of Jordan, who arrived in the Italian city on June 26. Queen Rania of Jordan arriving in Venice, Italy. Getty The fashion-forward wife of King Abdullah II wore all black—from her combat-style pants to her structured leather tote to her Prada sandals—as she arrived in the city. It is good to see Rania looking well after missing Jordan's Independence Day celebrations on May 25 after the Queen “was notably missing this year due to medical issues,” Tatler reported. Rania herself shared on Instagram that she was recovering from back pain treatment and was advised by her doctors to rest; she watched the ceremony from home alongside her daughter Princess Iman (not to be confused with her newborn granddaughter of the same name—but more on baby Princess Iman in a moment). Later in the evening on Thursday, Rania stepped out in a Fendi couture gown that appeared on the runway as part of the brand's Fall/Winter 2018 collection. The taupe dress features a mesh tulle layer embroidered with diamantes, which “glistened in the warm Italian sun,” The Daily Mail reported. Rania wrapped a cream shawl around her shoulders and topped off the gown with blush pink heels. While many A-list guests at the wedding are friends of Sánchez, Rania's friendship with Bezos extends almost a decade, according to The Daily Mail; the King and Queen first met the Amazon founder at the Al Husseiniya Palace in Amman, Jordan as far back as 2016. Rania is close enough to the couple to have been present at their engagement party on their yacht Koru, and the Queen made it a family affair at their wedding, as she was joined by her son Crown Prince Hussein, his wife Princess Rajwa, and their newborn Princess Iman. Queen Rania. Getty Queen Rania. Getty Hussein and Rajwa had a wedding of the year of their own in 2023, when they married that June; guests like Prince William and Kate Middleton were in attendance for that affair. Queen Rania in Rome, Italy on April 9, 2025. Getty Rania and her family are the royal guests du jour at the wedding, but there are plenty of glittery names in attendance, from Kris Jenner and Sydney Sweeney to Diane von Furstenberg, Eva Longoria, Orlando Bloom, and Tom Brady—for starters. Not only does Sánchez have real-life royalty at her wedding, but she might be channeling royalty in her wedding dress (which we can't wait to see)—her brother Paul told TMZ that the nuptials would be “star-studded and fun,” adding, “I think it's gonna be, like, a Princess Di thing.”"

Inside the Article Our Top Picks More AD-Approved Amazon Sheet Picks for Summer How We Tested How We Chose FAQs Best Overall Set $279.00, Amazon Upsides Made of luxe cotton Super soft Wrinkle-free Organic and OEKO-Tex certified Downsides On the more expensive side Specs Materials: 100% cotton , 400 thread count Sizes: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king, split king Colors: Mineral, natural pewter, shore, stone, white Contributor Kristi Kellogg says these sheets are “buttery, breathable wonders that make you feel like you're drifting off to sleep in a five-star hotel.” The sheets are made of top-tier, organic cotton and are completely chemical-free. The 17-inch-deep pocketed fitted sheet makes for a secure sleeping situation, and the sheets get softer with each wash, maintaining their crisp finish and luxe feel after even a couple years, says Kellogg. “These are definitely among the best sheets I've ever had,” she notes “I can't say enough good things about these. Buy them for yourself, buy them for your friends and family—anyone would be thrilled to sleep on these.” The Moisture-Wicking Set Bamboo Bay Luxury Bamboo Sheets $114.00, Amazon Upsides Fits well over mattress Soft fabric Ages well after washing Downsides May not be the best for sensitive skin Thin construction Quick to wrinkle Specs Materials: Viscose Made from Bamboo Sizes: Twin, full, queen, king, California king, split king Colors: White, dark grey, black, light grey, ivory, sage, light pink, light blue, ocean wave, sand, navy blue Contributor Jordan Goldberg loves to sleep as cool as she can, so she's a die-hard for bamboo sheets, which are cooling, moisture-wicking and sateen-adjacent. She reviews these sheets as having “the perfect thickness while still being airy and breathable to keep you cool while sleeping.” Another pro is the thick band on the fitted sheet, so there's no sheet-shifting in the night, and they cling well to your mattress. Best Cotton Sheets California Design Den Luxury Sheets $128.00, Amazon Upsides Cool enough for year-round use Durable Rich color options Downsides Not super soft at first (needs a few washes!) Thick construction Specs Materials: 100% cotton sateen weave Sizes: Queen, king, California king, split king Colors: Beige, blue, bright white, grey, ivory, light grey, navy blue, sage green Reminiscent of hotel bedding, commerce editor Audrey Lee was immediately impressed by this California Design Den set. “Though I was admittedly a little wary at first due to the thickness of the cotton (which read as too hot in my mind), the 1,000-thread-count sheets proved to be cool and airy on warmer nights and particularly cozy in cooler temperatures when I paired them with my favorite comforter,” she adds. What's more, these sheets wear nicely. Though Lee says they were crisp at first, a couple of washes softened them right up. After year-round use, she also confirms that this set is breathable enough to take you from season to season without any issues of wear. For a Silky Sleep Setup Luxome Luxury Sheet Set $185.00, Luxome Upsides Unique colorways available Sturdy material Lustrous sheen Downsides Run a bit large Specs Materials: Bamboo viscose Sizes: Twin, twin XL, full, queen, king, California king, split king Colors: Blush, charcoal, dune, ivory, navy, ocean, sapphire, stone, surf, terra-cotta, truffle, white Senior commerce editor Nashia Baker says these cooling sheets are soft yet breathable and mirror the lavish look of silk sheets at a lower price point. Unlike silk, which can sometimes have a delicate feel, these are made from smooth and durable bamboo viscose for easy care. Baker has been sleeping peacefully on this set and hasn't noticed any tearing or frayed threads over time. They also have a gloss to them that is particularly nice for a glam bedroom design. “These are even more unique because of the jewel tones, like sapphire, that are hard to find with other brands,” Baker adds.

I usually apply a generous layer like a lipstick, wait a few minutes, then rinse it off with water , it leaves a lovely natural pink stain on my lips. After that, I dab a tiny bit more with my finger to help it last longer. It generally lasts around 5-6 hours. If I eat, it fades by about 50%, but for everyday use and a natural, minimal makeup look, it's perfect and very satisfying.

mov_842EFC0CA5E4FABFFED624EB675C9513,2025-06-29 06:13:49,en,WEB,"  Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos leave the onlookers in awe with their post-wedding luncheon looks Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez turned Venice into a dreamland as they got married in a lavish ceremony on Friday. The pictures from their wedding are straight out of a fairyland and the couple radiated pure elegance in their respective couture pieces. The next day after the grand bash, the newlyweds embarked on a luncheon looking no less stylish. In a couple of newly surfaced photos, Jeff Bezos was spotted in public holding the hands of his ever-so-gorgeous wife as they arrived at the venue for a post-wedding luncheon. For the event, Lauren opted for an off-shoulder little black dress that perfectly accentuated her curves. The mini dress featured ruffled detailing with dramatically thin straps and a cinched waist. The forner journalist knows how to style her looks with the right accessories. For the luncheon, she picked a huge straw hat with black ribbon detailing, a pair of heels and oversized sunglasses to add an oomph factor to her overall look. Lauren also carried a grey-hued, textured arm candy that screamed luxury in from a mile away. Coming to her styling, Lauren went for a subtle foundation laden base teamed with a glossy pink tint on her lips. An ample amount of blush on her cheeks maximised her beauty. Last but not least, she left her blonde tresses cascade down her shoulders to finish off her look. On the other hand, Jeff Bezos looked dapper in a coffee brown-hued T-shirt paired with matching trousers. A pair of dark, shaded leather shoes, a pricy watch and tinted glasses wrapped up his charm. The lovebirds were also seen blowing kisses to onlookers as they left their Venice hotel, radiating a newlywed glow. Talking about the couple's look for their grand wedding, it was no less magical. Jeff picked a black suit layered with a matching waistcoat and a crisp white shirt. A black bow and a pair of polished leather shoes finished off his look. On the other side, his bride looked ethereal in a pristine white fish-cut Dolce & Gabbana gown with a long trail behind. The beautiful piece featured buttoned detailing at the front with an illusion lacy effect near the neck portion and sleeves. Donning it, Lauren was seen exuding pure elegance and teamed it with her bright smile. A mystical veil with her half-done hairdo and glam makeup added further elegance to her overall look. The newlyweds, Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez served fashion goals with their casual post wedding looks.

mov_E2200D15969759DC06BEE9ED058DBDF7,2025-06-29 06:18:08,en,WEB,"  After a fairy-tale wedding in Venice on June 27, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez Bezos wrapped up their extravagant celebration with an exclusive pajama-themed after-party. Dubbed ""Dolce Notte"" (Italian for ""Sweet Night""), the soirée proved to be a star-studded affair to remember. Hosted in the heart of Venice, this final wedding event gave the couple's inner circle, including global icons and celebrities, a chance to let loose, toast to love, and dress to impress in pajama-inspired couture, of course. Who wore what to Bezos' pajama party? Forget those boring nightsuits and pajama sets; this was a fashion-forward pajama party dripping in high-end labels and red-carpet drama. Bride Sanchez, staying true to her signature glam, wore a stunning blush pink Atelier Versace gown crafted in silk and chiffon, far from typical bedtime attire. Meanwhile, Bezos complemented his wife in a chic, dark-toned three-piece suit. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates kept it comfy yet luxe in designer Prada, while global sensation Kim Kardashian took the glam route with a corset ensemble, layered under a dramatic robe. Further, Usher showed up in a midnight blue tuxedo-style look, with a robe-like jacket, and Oprah Winfrey stunned in a bronze silk outfit that oozed old Hollywood elegance. Lastly, Orlando Bloom arrived in a polka-dotted pajama set. Gifts to remember! The couple's attention to detail extended to thoughtful gifting. Guests were treated to signature slippers to remember the night. As per media reports, men received plush blue velvet Venetian loafers from Vibi Venezia, while women were gifted black open-toe slippers from Amazon, symbolising a union of both Jeff and Lauren's tastes. ""So you have a little of both!"" Lauren told Vogue. Additionally, each guest's room came stocked with carefully curated Venetian goodie bags, complete with artisanal pastries from one of the city's oldest patisseries, celebrating the local charm of Venice."

mov_5EFA2E4E60DEC6EEB4251A927BB6A747,2025-06-29 18:23:38,en,WEB,"  Creating a harmonious and inviting home begins long before the first brushstroke hits the wall; it ⁣starts⁣ with a ⁤vision-an artistic tapestry woven from the colors ​that speak⁢ to you. A thoughtfully crafted color palette has the power to‍ transform⁤ your living space, reflecting your personality and enhancing your mood. In⁤ this guide, we will explore the essential​ steps to building a​ cohesive color palette for your entire home. From understanding⁤ the ⁢emotional impact‌ of colors​ to​ considering the flow between rooms, you'll learn how to curate a symphony of hues that not only ties your home together but also creates an atmosphere that resonates with comfort and style. Whether you're​ a seasoned ‍decorator or just beginning your journey, let's embark on this colorful ⁣adventure to bring⁤ your dream home to life. Establishing⁢ Your Color Foundation Through Inspiration ​and ‌Functionality Creating a cohesive color palette for your home begins with drawing inspiration from various sources that resonate with⁢ your personal ​style and daily life. Visit ⁢local art galleries,‌ nature parks, ⁢or even ⁤explore your favorite fabrics and accessories⁢ for a burst of ideas. Look closely at the⁤ shades and tones that evoke emotion or create ambiance. Consider collecting images or⁢ samples that catch ‍your‍ eye,whether its a stunning ⁣sunset,an intricate⁣ pattern on a textile,or the soothing hues of a coastal landscape.Some ⁤key sources of inspiration include: Nature: Observe color ‍combinations in flowers, trees, and landscapes. Artwork: Select pieces that showcase colors you're drawn to. Travel: Capture unique color palettes from your⁣ journeys. Fabric Swatches: Utilize textiles from throw pillows or curtains. While inspiration offers a creative spark, functionality is essential in shaping your color foundation. When establishing your palette, think about‍ the emotions and atmospheres you want to evoke in each space. As an example, a calming⁢ blue⁣ may suit a bedroom, while energetic yellows ​might ‍be perfect for ‌a ⁢home office. To ensure cohesion, create‌ a mood board⁣ that integrates your chosen shades, allowing you to visualize how they flow together ​throughout the different rooms. Remember ​to consider: Create a Dining Room You'll Actually Use Functionality Suggested Colors Relaxation Soft Blues, Greens Creativity Bold yellows, Oranges Focus Neutral Grays, Whites Warmth Earthy Browns, Terracotta [embedded content] Understanding Color Theory for Harmonious Home ⁣Design To build a cohesive color palette throughout‌ your home, consider the three main components⁤ of color theory: hue,‌ saturation, and brightness. Hue refers to ‌the actual ‍color itself,while⁢ saturation ⁢describes the intensity or purity of that color. lastly, brightness indicates how light or dark a color appears. Start by⁤ selecting a few‌ key hues that resonate ‍with your personal style-these ‍can be inspired ‍by nature, artwork, ‌or existing furniture. Aim for a balance‌ by ⁤mixing warm ​colors like reds⁤ and yellows with cool‍ tones ⁣such as blues and greens to create ‌a dynamic yet harmonious environment. After selecting your core hues,it's essential to think about the 65-30-5 rule ⁢ in your submission of color throughout the spaces in ‌your home. This guideline suggests using 65% of a dominant color (walls‍ and larger furnishings), 30% of a secondary‍ color ​(softer accents like rugs or curtains), and 5% for ‍accent colors (such ⁤as cushions or decorative elements). Complementary colors can enhance visual interest and create tension in a room, while analogous colors, which sit next to each other on the color wheel, promote ‌unity. Incorporating textures and‍ patterns can also help make your palette feel​ richer and more inviting. Consider the following color combinations​ for inspiration: Color Pairing Effect Teal & Gray Modern ⁢and calming Mustard & Olive Green Warm and earthy Blush Pink & Navy Chic ‍and complex..."

Your makeup won't picture as well as having a bit more on would, and if you want a natural look that is just fine! But if you want to amp it up a bit I'd suggest applying more brush, contour and some bronzer and maybe a lip liner as well, you could even add a slightly shimmery natural shade shadow I find at least a small amount of shadow makes everything look cohesive, as for your concealer or foundation you have on I think it looks great and matches your skin perfectly. I am a new esthetician who loves makeup and my biggest suggestion when it comes to makeup is look into color theory this will completely change your makeup and how cohesive it looks together! I could be wrong because a picture doesn't always give the best idea, but it looks like you have a pink undertone if this is the case soft pinks, peachier pinks, and neutral mauve will look the best on your skin for blush or lip liner or lip stick! Do some research on products that work best for your undertone on TikTok, ChatGPT, or YouTube as well because there is some great ideas on there!"

Dubbed “Dolce Notte” (Italian for “Sweet Night”), the soirée proved to be a star-studded affair to remember. Hosted in the heart of Venice, this final wedding event gave the couple's inner circle, including global icons and celebrities, a chance to let loose, toast to love, and dress to impress in pajama-inspired couture, of course. Who wore what during the wedding? Forget those boring nightsuits and pajama sets; this was a fashion-forward pajama party dripping in high-end labels and red-carpet drama. Bride Sanchez, staying true to her signature glam, wore a stunning blush pink Atelier Versace gown crafted in silk and chiffon, far from typical bedtime attire. Meanwhile, Bezos complemented his wife in a chic, dark-toned three-piece suit. Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates kept it comfy yet luxe in designer Prada, while global sensation Kim Kardashian took the glam route with a corset ensemble, layered under a dramatic robe.

As per media reports, men received plush blue velvet Venetian loafers from Vibi Venezia, while women were gifted black open-toe slippers from Amazon, symbolising a union of both Jeff and Lauren's tastes. “So you have a little of both!” Lauren told Vogue. Additionally, each guest's room came stocked with carefully curated Venetian goodie bags, complete with artisanal pastries from one of the city's oldest patisseries, celebrating the local charm of Venice.

From foundation and concealer to contour, blush, and mascara—she keeps it simple yet effective. Sharing the video, Rakul captioned it: “5 minutes. That's all it takes to feel fresh, fierce, and ready” (Image: @rakulpreet/Instagram) Every time Rakul Preet Singh steps out, she manages to turn heads. The actress is almost always impeccably dressed, with her glam game equally on point. Recently, she took to Instagram to share her 5-minute makeup routine, giving fans quick tips and tricks to get it right. Rakul revealed that the first step after her morning routine is applying foundation. She used a brush and two drops of foundation, applying it all over her face—especially around the eye area. Next, she applied under-eye concealer and blended it using her fingers instead of a sponge. Story continues below The concealer was also used to hide blemishes. Then came contouring, which she said is her favorite step, as she loves a chiselled look. To even things out, she used powder and followed it up with another round of contouring to define her cheekbones. She then dabbed a bit of contour on her eyelids as eyeshadow, using her fingers, because she finds it faster and easier than brushes. If you're heading out, she suggested adding a little sheen over the eyeshadow for some extra glam. Next, she applied blush with a smile, noting that it helps highlight the cheeks better, and added a bit on the nose as well. For the final touch, she used a pink lipstick, suggesting it can also double up as a blush. The last step of her routine was a swipe of mascara. Needless to say, she looked as stunning as ever. Sharing the video, Rakul captioned it: “5 minutes. That's all it takes to feel fresh, fierce, and ready.” Fans loved the easy routine. One wrote, “I have the same routine.” Another commented, “You don't need makeup.” A third added, “How cutely explained.” Many others dropped heart emojis and called her “beautiful.”"

Designed by Architect Navneet Bawa @navneetbawaarchitects in collaboration with Rosabagh @rosabaghofficial, this New Delhi home named Rosavel Manor revels in subtle elegance inspired by European-inspired palatial design. From opulent seating adorned with gold accents to statement coffee tables inlaid with striking patterns, every creation at Rosabagh transforms this home into a timeless masterpiece. The living room sets the tone with gold-accented sofa chairs, smooth curves and a statement coffee table with ornate embellishments. In the dining room, a marble tabletop with hand-inlaid geometric motifs nods to Florentine symmetry, complemented by a vintage mirror and sculptural decor. The family room layers olive silk furnishings with classical figurines on the armrests and carved acanthus-leaf side tables. In the bedrooms, pastel rose and ivory walls meet sculpted mouldings, while blush pink velvet sofas and carved bedframes echo the finesse of a Renaissance estate. Every corner carries the imprint of intricate craftsmanship, tying classical references with modern ease. As Abhishek Kathuria, Founder of Rosabagh, affirms, “A home is more than just four walls; it is a story designed to be narrated.” Create your own renaissance-era inspired sanctuary through https://www.instagram.com/rosabaghofficial/ Styling: Barkha A Kathuria @barkhakathuria Photography: Deepak Aggarwal @deepakaggarwalphotography #elledecorindia #elledecor #rosabagh #promotion #rosavelmanor #rosabagh #furniture #timelessdesign #curatedspaces #modernheritage #interiordesign #navneetbawadesigns #architect #interiordesign #luxurydining #diningtableinspo #offwhiteinteriors #goldaccents #modernclassic #timelessdesign #curatedspaces #furnitureart #interiorinspo #diningroomgoals #mutedtones #luxurydecor #interiorelegance"

A minimalist dress, white shirt and tailored pants or a jumpsuit is such a chic and sophisticated base. It just takes the swipe of a bold lip to turn the understated into glamour. Here are five bold lip colours that add glamour to minimal outfits. We have handpicked a stunning collection of lipsticks that can instantly add glamour to your minimal outfits. Classic Red Want to look effortlessly chic in subtle outfits? A classic red lipstick must be on your list. It's universally flattering and instantly brightens your complexion. Paired with a monochromatic black outfit, a white ensemble, or even a simple denim look, a true red lip provides a sophisticated pop of colour that screams elegance. Choose 458 - SENSUELLE from CHANEL or Ruby Woo from MAC to ace the look. Deep Burgundy If you want a moodier, more mysterious and incredibly chic look, go for deep berry or even Burgundy shades. Opt for 467 - PRÉCIEUSE from CHANEL and 696 Burgundy Blush from Maybelline; these shades deliver instant luxury and sophistication and are perfect for evening events. Fuchsia Pink If you're looking to add a playful touch to your outfit, a bright fuchsia is the way to go. Choose 122 - PLAY from CHANEL or MP1 Pink Perfect from Nykaa, the shades are full of a fun, energetic splash of electric colour that is youthful, modern, and fun. Fuchsia works well with basic attire like white, black, or light grey and gives you a pop of unexpected colour. Deep Violet Want to get a different look that screams elegance? Choose deep violet lipstick from 468 - ÉLÉGANTE from CHANEL and Cyber from MAC, which offers richness and depth. These shades are sophisticated and particularly stunning with minimal outfits. Burnt Orange For a warm and highly fashionable statement, choose a burnt orange with your minimal or subtle outfits to exude a captivating look. This choice feels modern, artistic and effortlessly cool. Some of the shades that resemble this colour are 212 - STUPÉFIANTE from CHANEL and 674 Madison Red from Maybelline.

I know it's one of the unpopular releases but I'm so glad I got my hands on it. I can use it for a wash of color on the eyes with the shimmer, for mapping the outline and fill in my brows, add warmth or cool to my face. ~~ ✅ ~~40.

Although all the shimmers don't have the same wow effect, they exceeded my expectations because the swatches didn't do them justice, as far as I'm concerned. If it's still available, I really recommend getting one. ~~ **Ongoing:** ☑️ 34. A bronzer - e.l.f. Luminous Putty Bronzer in Sun Chaser - 5/10 ☑️ 66.

The face pencil by jones road is great and so is Trish mcevoy eyeshadow palettes. In glaze and other natural colors, it really puts a natural glow on. Trish lip pencil in nude is fantastic . I dropped a little extra money on the Trish products but I love her. Estée Lauder tiger eye lipstick is a glowy bronze pink and it's worth the price. Keeping that one in rotation. Two dupe palates that I use for Trish are by color club susikeki 3 mini and 2. I got a great set of cheap makeup brushes off of Amazon iI use Almay burgundy smudgy eye liner for green eyes but I'm pretty sure it was suggested for mature skin. It's just a very glowy look and pretty natural and I get lots of compliments mostly from younger women asking me what the colors are. lol"

Ivanka Trump may not be the bride, but she certainly turned heads at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's star-studded wedding in Venice. The former First Daughter shared a series of elegant photos on social media as she prepared to attend the couple's rehearsal dinner, wearing a dress so luxurious that it could get her a Ducati Scrambler. Ivanka Trump packed her 4 best dresses for Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez wedding celebration in Venice: 10+ inside pics How much does Ivanka Trump's Luxe floral cost? The standout outfit? An Oscar de la Renta mini dress called the Cherry Blossom Sequin Dress, originally part of the brand's bridal collection. Though a different version of the same dress is currently sold out online, it retails for a whopping $9,990, nearly double the average monthly income for Americans, which sits around $5,174, per Fidelity's analysis of U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data. The former First Daughter's Luxe floral dress would have cost more. The designer dress is with ombre sequins that show different shades of pink  lighter blush to a little darker pink , decorated with fine florals of cherry tree blossoms, and with a vine-like halter neck. Ivanka had that blond hair sporting in loose curls and had her accessories to a minimum with only the wedding ring and the white strappy heals adorning her. “Ready to celebrate the love story of our friends, @laurenwsanchez and @jeffbezos,” she wrote in the caption of her rooftop photo shoot overlooking Venice. Ivanka Trump's hubby Jared Kushner's eight-word demand at Bezos lavish Venice wedding revealed: 'She'd like to…' Online, fans couldn't get enough of Ivanka's refined look “Ivanka definitely looked the most beautifully dressed out of all these ladies. Very elegant and classy,” one wrote. “So beautiful  this dress is perfection on you. Beautiful couple also. Love, love , love ,” another commented. “The prettiest and chiquest,” one piped in. For the main event, Ivanka wore a show-stopping strapless gown by Tony Ward, part of the designer's Fall 2024 couture collection. Covered in floral sequin embroidery and featuring a thigh-high slit, the dress was described as “a couture masterpiece” with “embroidered tulle in a subtle heather pink.” Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez wedding: From Kim Kardashian to Ivanka Trump – Best and worst dressed celebrities | Photos She also kept things stylish in her downtime, seen in Venice in a red halter dress from House of CB and a cream crop-top set by La DoubleJ."

UgxHBWDe6zUAR4PAeQ14AaABAg,2025-07-01 12:00:57,en,YOUTUBE,"  Aloha gorgeous, Wow, that Guerlain palette was made for you! So gorgeous, and I think you could wear it year round. For the Guerlain powder, I like the translucent all over, but more so for under the eyes, and any where I need brightening. It has a slight pink tint to it. The Medium powder I like all over, not under my eyes. It's a bit too dark under the eyes for me. I also love the medium shade if my foundation looks a bit too light, and it's gorgeous over a tinted SPF too. The powder is amazing, I agree with the container being a bit too big. I wish they would have included a smaller container to decant for travel. That would be great, especially for the price. I have to try a Guerlain blush, I'm having a hard time picking out a shade.I don't have a store nearby where I can swatch. Our Nordstrom is far, and they seem to not have much selection of Guerlain even on line. I'm not sure what's going on. My new obsession is the Prada eye shadows. I have 3 palettes, and I love them so much. Along with the Dior Cannage LE palettes. Have you tried the Dior Cannage yet? I think you would love Brown Cashmere. It's so gorgeous!! The formula is comparable to the Prada. I want to try the Guerlain shadows, but I haven't found a color story that resonates yet. Lately I've been into the smaller palettes versus large palettes. Just easier to put a look together when you're short on time. Thank you for your video, hope you're all enjoying the Summer! Xoxo PS. I love the Guerlain concealer it's lovely for the summer. I wish it came in a plastic container versus the glass, and the wand was easier to get out. I dropped mine on my tile floor, and it shattered. I order another one. What do you think about the Gucci concealer? I would like to try it, but can't figure out what shade."

The Amazon founder, 61, and the former journalist, 55, tied the knot on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, Italy, with over 200 celebrity guests invited to the £40 million soiree, last week. Guests pulled out all the stops in their finest designer ensembles, as the world's media tuned in to catch every glamorous moment of the star-studded affair. However one standout fashion trend that stole hearts was pulled off perfectly by some of the best dressed celebs including Sydney Sweeney, Oprah Winfrey, Khloe Kardashian and Ivanka Trump. While butter yellow was known as the fashion industry's colour of summer 2025, blush pink was the color of the day among the celebs at the Bezos wedding. Best blush-pink wedding guest dresses of SS25 From the ceremony to the after‑party, a host of A‑listers embraced the delicate pink hue, with the Once Upon a Time in Hollywood actress turning heads in a pink vintage-inspired strapless gown designed by Oscar de la Renta. The flowing fabric and romantic cut of the gown was perfectly suited to the Venetian setting. For the wedding after party the beauty changed into yet another blush pink gown, as she sizzled in a plunging floral dress featuring a sweeping frilled skirt by Elie Saab. She added a few extra inches to her frame with a pair of pink satin heels and let her outfit do all the talking as she exited the glitzy venue. Meanwhile media mogul Oprah also joined the trend, in a refined off‑the‑shoulder blush‑pink wrap dress, earning her a spot among the wedding's best‑dressed guests. The structural draping of the gown helped accentuate Winfrey's hourglass shape, while the frothy chiffon sleeves and skirt added a soft touch to the designer frock. Elsewhere Khloe Kardashian, who celebrated her 41st birthday on Friday during the star-studded affair, wore a strapless baby pink sequin gown paired with a matching feather wrap. While Ivanka Trump donned the jaw-dropping Oscar de la Renta pink mini dress as she prepared to celebrate the couple at their rehearsal dinner. Her outfit of choice, which can be found in the bridal selection on the website, is called the Cherry Blossom Sequin dress. It is sold out online but retails for $9,990. The stunning dress is covered in ombre sequins, cascading down from an almost-white pale pink to a slightly darker hue. Meanwhile for the wedding she stayed with the pink colour scheme and opted for a another stunning sequin gown which featured a leg split. Whether you're heading to a summer wedding, a garden party, or just want to channel some soft glamour, here's how to make the look your own with high street style."
mov_0F616B39CDCF16B93AE3EDD8AD4F4C1C,2025-07-01 14:10:45,en,WEB,"  An everyday lipstick, like any other part of a makeup or beauty routine, is inherently personal and varies from person to person. I've gone through practically every phase imaginable. At one point, a bright cherry red was my go-to. At another, I wanted a nude lipstick so subtle I could barely tell it apart from my natural lip color—the versatility is part of what makes playing with makeup so fun. Still, there are a few boxes that your go-to formula should easily check. “A great everyday lipstick is all about balance,” says celebrity makeup artist Ash K. Holm. “It should be comfortable, long-wearing, and easy to apply without a mirror.” Holm adds that a formula that hydrates the lips is ideal, but it also needs enough pigment to pull a look together. On top of that, it should fade evenly—no harsh lines as it wears off throughout the day. Sounds like a tall order? It is, but that's where I come in. Next to blush, lipstick is one of my absolute favorite makeup categories to test, and I've come across quite a few that can satisfy even the pickiest beauty lover. Keep reading to find the everyday lipstick that deserves a spot in your collection. The Best Everyday Lipsticks Best Everyday Lipstick Overall MAC Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick in Thanks, It's Mac! MAC's Lustreglass Lipstick, specifically in the shade Thanks It's MAC, is the closest thing to a truly universal lipstick that I have ever found. It's a taupey pink with a silver pearl, but don't let that scare you—the shimmer is virtually nonexistent in this formula once you swipe it onto your lips. One of my favorite things about this shade is that it can be worn with or without a lip liner, and it layers beautifully. Finish: Glossy Key Ingredients: Castor seed oil, shea butter, squalane (moisturizing) What I Love: Looks good on the majority of skin tones; Sleek packaging; Barely-there scent What I Don't: Due to the emollience of the formula, it wears off quickly Review for MC: “This is one of my favorite lipsticks of all time, and for good reason. It's a neutral-toned taupe pink color that doesn't veer too cool or warm, making it perfectly suitable for a variety of skin tones. It also layers beautifully with other lipstick formulas in my collection, acting almost like a traditional gloss by depositing color without taking over the entire look.” — Ariel Baker, Beauty Writer Ariel Baker testing MAC Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick in Thanks, Its Mac! (Image credit: Ariel Baker) Best Everyday Neutral Lipstick NYX Smushy Matte Lip Balm in Soft Smile This is a newer formula to my makeup routine, but I'm so glad I came across it. The Smush Matte Lip Balms sound a little confusing (mainly because I've never used a lip balm that's actually matte before), but once I applied it, I saw the magic in the formula. I'd consider this more of a blurring lipstick, similar to soft-focus formulas popular in the K-Beauty space. The shade Soft Smile, a brown nude, is the closest I've gotten to a true skin-toned match on myself in a long time, but it also works nicely as a neutral across a majority of skin tones. And as the brand claims, it really does blur the lines in my lips, creating a gorgeous, soft-matte canvas. Finish: Matte Key Ingredients: Dimethicone (silicone base that smooths lines); Ceramide np (improves skin barrier function); Shea butter (moisturizes) What I Love: 12 shades; Most affordable lipstick on this list What I Don't: Strong caramel scent that lingers for a bit before fading, which is a personal preference Review for MC: “This is such a fun lipstick to keep in my purse. Not only is it super compact, but the formula feels almost like a traditional silicone primer on my lips, and just like those formulas, it blurs the lines and imperfections on the area while depositing color—a win-win if you ask me. While it has a strong scent, I'm completely willing to overlook it not only for the unique formula but also the gorgeous nude shade that is Soft Smile, which complements my skin tone perfectly.” — Ariel Baker, Beauty Writer Ariel Baker testing NYX Smushy Matte Lip Balm in Soft Smile.

n0sunrd,2025-07-01 18:10:30,en,REDDIT,"  Oh man, my list is all over the place! If I'm on the hunt for something specific, I'll search whatever keywords I can think of that would be related to or maybe included in a product name for that item. Most recently it's been ""keyboard"" but I just found one this morning so probably won't be searching that one a whole bunch anymore (if the one I picked up is what it says it is, anyway). I've also been searching on variations of ""window film"" to try and find something I like well enough to install on a couple of our south- and west-facing windows before the real heat of the summer hits us. I always search for the brand names of the various power tools and yard equipment my husband has and the make/model of his tractor and our vehicles for replacement parts, rebuild kits, batteries, storage solutions, etc. Occasionally I'll search for the brand/model of our phones if we're on the lookout for a new case or screen protector. I also search ""silicone"" and go through pretty much the entire list of stuff that comes up there, because there are SO many different items I've found in those results that I didn't even know we needed until I saw the listing... When I'm just browsing and/or haven't found specific items we want/need, then I usually click my way through a couple of certain categories in their entirety, just to see what's there. Everything in ""Pet Supplies"", several of the sub-categories under both ""Tools & Home Improvement"" and ""Patio, Lawn & Garden"", plus a few others. I also search several versions my favorite colors (pink, blush, rose gold, rainbow, etc.) and various finishes (glitter/y, bling/y, sparkle/sparkly, etc.) just to see what kind of little treats I can find for myself if I'm not looking for something specific. The ONE think I wish Amazon would figure out (not just for Vine searches, but overall for all of their product/item searches) is a way to exclude certain items from search results. Like, just enable the preceding/leading minus/dash like the rest of the internet does, already! I will never have a reason to get one of the HUNDREDS of photo backdrops they have in Vine, and I'd like to be able to exclude certain things from my search results on the regular Amazon site, too, so I feel like this would be something that would benefit everyone, not just us Vine folks, right?"

Maybe it's the soft, lived-in finishes, the cheeky colour pops, or the effortless way these looks come together. Either way, we're in love. This edit is our love letter to the makeup colours that give glow, range, and “yes, that's going on my face.” This month's makeup palette is equal parts fun and wearable, packed with colour stories that work on Nigerian skin and still feel current. Here are seven makeup colours we can't stop thinking about: Read Also: 6 Common Setting Powder Mistakes (And How This Makeup Artist Fixes Them) 1. Burnt Taupe – For Your Contour-But-Make-It-Soft Look Think of burnt taupe as your sculpting cheat code. It's not quite brown or grey, but it gives natural definition, especially around the cheeks and eyes. Use it to softly contour your face, smoke out your lash line, or even as an eyeshadow base. The tone is calm without looking dull and blends into the skin like second nature. It's also a great option for minimalist beats or clean girl makeup that still needs a bit of structure. When applied with a fluffy brush or beauty sponge, it melts into the skin for a seamless finish, which is precisely why we love it. Try the Sleek Makeup Face Contour Kit (light/medium) for this look. Price: ₦3,500 2. Peachy Coral – The Ultimate Warm-Glow Shade Peach and coral tones add life to your face instantly. Use it as a cream blush, tinted gloss, or even lightly across your eyelids. This colour gives that fresh-outside warmth without needing bronzer. It flatters every skin tone, and in this heat, it pairs beautifully with glowy or dewy skin finishes. Related: Which Blush Will Have You Looking Flawless? Coral is also very forgiving. You can layer it generously without it looking heavy or keep it subtle, and it always looks good. Coral is the sweet middle if you're tired of pink but not ready for red. Try Phoera Cream Blush (Sunflower Shade) Price: ₦4,500 3. Soft Lilac – The Playful Blush or Eyelid Colour You Didn't Expect Lilac is having a moment, especially on cheeks and lids. It adds a cool, almost dreamy flush to the face that feels fresh and different from the usual pink. You can wear it as blush on bare skin or tap it into the centre of your lids for a soft halo effect. For deeper skin tones, soft lilac adds contrast in a romantic and edgy way. The trick is to apply it in thin layers and build intensity as needed. Pair it with clear gloss and soft lashes for a lovely finish. This colour works well when your outfit is doing the most and you want your makeup to stay cute and calm. Sylvimac Eyeshadow Palette has this colour amongst 72 others. Price: ₦11,400 4. Metallic Olive Green – Your Soft Glam with an Edge Olive tones aren't new, but this metallic version is the update we love. It's bold but earthy, and works great for smoky eyes or as a metallic liner across the eyelid. It pairs perfectly with brown or gold shadow and looks especially rich against melanin. You can wear it as a full-sheer eyeshadow or press it into the centre for dimension. Check out Amazon for the olive green eyeshadow palette. Price: $14 5.

I paid for an analysis in NYC last year, granted I was little more tan because I got back from the beach, but they said I was vivid spring. I was SHOCKED. I didn't quite believe it so I tried chatGPT which told me I'm a soft autumn. That's why I was like I gotta get on Reddit and settle this!! But I do agree, I tried coral blush for the first time after hearing that I'm a vivid spring. It was actually such a good color on me!

Цветочный минимализм Цветы летом? Да, это классика! Но в этом сезоне в моде очень маленькие цветочки. Такой дизайн легко адаптировать: можно выбрать яркие оттенки или остановиться на нейтральных тонах.

1lqudra,2025-07-03 16:44:03,en,REDDIT,"  First off, I'm very uncomfortable making this post as my body dysmorphia makes me feel incredibly embarrassed and shameful about my appearance, but here it goes: I've been struggling to find out what I can do to improve my makeup. I feel like I come off as looking like a man in a wig. So I'm looking specifically for tips on how to feminize my face among these other things, though any constructive criticism at all is welcome: - how to properly line my lips and apply lipstick with my double lip line - generally achieve a more lifted look - how to apply lower lash mascara without smudging (I've tried toilet paper under the eye and I still smudge- maybe because of my really sparse lower lashes?) - what brow shape may suit me best - proper blush color and placement - eyeliner shape that suits the shape of my eyes As for the products used, my list is as follows (I'm on mobile y'all sorry!) Primer: ELF Hydrogrip Foundation: NARS Radiant Longwear (Barcelona) Setting Spray: O/S On Til Dawn Concealer: Maybelline Instant Age Rewind Eraser (122) Brows: ABH Dipbrow Pomade (Ebony) Mascara: Milani Highly Rated Tubing Mascara Eyeliner: ELF H2O Proof Eyeliner Pen Lower lash line: NYX Jumbo Eye Pencil (White) and Milani Supreme Kohl Kajal Lashes are extensions that definitely need filling!

1lqw2nm,2025-07-03 17:50:10,en,REDDIT,"  I bought 5 China-exclusive products or shades from a third-party seller on Yamibuy called ""BetterMe Beauty Store"". I ordered on June 18, and it arrived yesterday July 2nd. I didn't get charged any customs fees. I've been wanting the Strawberry Cupid palette in 02 Strawberry Cassis since forever, but it's not readily accessible to us western customers. A product in the same packaging is sold on their global site, Amazon, YesStyle, Urban Outfitters, etc., but the colors are swapped for a Anastasia Beverly Hills Modern Renaissance-like color story called S02 Cupid's Mischief. I paid $28 for mine, while the other shades retails for $40 on their global site. It is a cool-toned smokey neutrals palette with a pink blush and matte highlighter with pink undertones. While it is smokey, it's still prefect for everyday use. I would type this as cool winter. Some of the shades look similar to some shades in their Little Angel palette in Eden's Angel, but they're different enough that if you already have Eden's Angel, you can also get this. The medium gray shade in Eden's Angel is a blueish-gray, where the one in Strawberry Cassis is more of a brownish- gray. And the shimmers in Eden's Angel are glitter topper shades, while the most similar looking one in Strawberry Cassis is a shimmer. When I first saw the Shell's Jewel eyeshadow palette in 02 Marine Shell online, it was my favorite of the 3, and I knew that I was definitely going to get it. But when Flower Knows announced the new collection on the global Instagram page, I saw that they swapped the beautiful colors in this palette for hot pinks and bright blues (S02 Mermaid Tears) that I can easily find a Walmart/Ulta/Target dupe for. I was very disappointed, so I bought both 01 Moonlight Mermaid and 03 Deep Sea when they first launched on their global site, out of anger (btw, I have my own swatches of these 2 palette here on this sub). So I'm so happy to have finally gotten my hands on Marine Shell! I paid $25 for mine (compared to $35 for the other shades on the global website). I thought some of the shades in this palette looked familar, so I swatched them next to some of the shades in their Swan Ballet palette in 01 White Swan, and the 4 shades from each palette were really similar, but the pale pink shade in Marine Shell is more cool-toned than the one in White Swan, the middle and darkest shades are both lighter, and the glitters are chunkier than the peachy shimmer shade in White Swan. It does have two cool-toned pale blue shades, but I will still type this palette as warm spring overall, since the rest of the palette is more warm-toned. I don't know what I wanted it and bought it when I am so yellow/warm-toned and 02 Tawny Tea works so perfectly for me already, but I still got the Butterfly Cloud Collar Contour/Highlight palette in 01 Moonlight Shadow anyways. For the western/non-East Asian market, the shades in this palette were replaced for two different shimmer highlighters and bronzers (Leaf Shadow), probably since most westerners don't contour or even know what matte highlighter is. I paid $28 dollars for this. On the global site, it's $35. It's basically just a cool-toned version of 02 Tawny Tea. The highlighters and whiter, and the contours are more gray. It is somewhat comparable to the Judydoll contour palette in 01 Waves (their cool-toned option), but Judydoll's highlighers are more pink and hair face contour has some red undertones. Personally I prefer the Flower Knows contour palette over the Judydoll contour palette, because they are most pigmented and contain more grams of product (16g vs 9.5g). I had always been curious about their Midsummer Fairytales concealers that come in the same packaging as their liquid highlighters, because I heard great things about it and VA03 looked like a perfect shade for me. But obviously, it's only sold and China, probably because it only comes in 4 shades total, which will definitely cause an outrage among western customers. So their swapped them for liquid highlighters which are only avaliable outside of China. It's 6 grams, and I paid $18 for mine. The liquid highlighters are $22. I thought the shade would be similar to 1 Birch from Hourglass and Y1 from Natasha Denona, but it's actually darker than both of them. Which is fine since both Hourglass Birch and Natasha Denona Y1 were brightening shades for me anyways. It is more similar to shade 2 Cotton from Hourglass, but a little less yellow. And finally, I got one of the Never's Shop blushes. The entire Never's Shop collection is exclusive to China. The rest of the world got the Violet Strawberry Rococo collection instead. The entire collection was so cute that I really wanted to get the eyeshadow palette and at least one of the potted lip creams as well, but I thought that the colors in the Never's Shop eyeshadow palette was too similar to the White Swan palette, and I wasn't interested in any of the 3 lip cream colors, so I decided against them. Such a shame, because the lip cream packaging are so darn cute, but I'm just not into red lips. So I just got one of the blushes. I got the most warm-toned color called 02 Peggy's Breakfast, since I am a warm autumn. I got mine for $20, a little less than $26, the price for all of their powder blushes on their global shop. I thought that it might be similar to some Flower Knows blushes that I already have, but surprisingly, none of my other Flower Knows blushes is an exact dupe for 02 Peggy's Breakfast. The most similar color I'll say is their Strawberry Cupid liquid blush in 05 Rum Cocoa. But obviously, it's a liquid blush and it's much more pigmented, so you can definitely get Peggy's Breakfast if you already have Run Cocoa."

Imagine getting pulled over by a bright pink Tesla Cybertruck, only to discover it's an undercover police vehicle. Courtney Ferris (@courtferriswheel3), in a TikTok video clip, says that as she was leaving a restaurant, she saw the pink Cybertruck and couldn't believe it. But, she was even more surprised as she took a closer look. Here's the way it went down. Picture Courtney walking out of a fast food restaurant, and a bright pink Tesla Cybertruck catches her eye. It's parked away from the other cars, and she walks over to check the unusual truck out. She was on her way to drive home in her trusty, if slightly dented, sedan from the asphalt jungle of the parking lot. That's when it caught my eye. A behemoth of unmistakable angles, with an audacity that could only belong to a Tesla Cybertruck. But this wasn't just any Cybertruck. This one was... pink. Not a subtle, blush pink. Not a faded, pastel pink. This was a vibrant, unapologetic, bubblegum-meets-neon pink that practically vibrated, “look at me.” Cortney's first thought was, ""Wow, someone really committed to the aesthetic."" As she drew closer to the Cybertruck, that's when her chuckle turned to a gasp. She walked around the back and focused on the license plate. It wasn't a novelty plate. It wasn't a custom vanity plate. Nestled snugly next to the numbers and letters, there is a state emblem, an unmistakable sheriff's badge. And beneath it, in official-looking script, ""COUNTY POLICE."" Her next thought, a split second later, was, ""Imagine getting pulled over by that."" She chuckled to herself, already picturing the bewildered faces of drivers seeing this metallic flamingo in their rearview mirror. I mean, what cop would drive that? “An undercover cop"" felt like an understatement. It was so overtly not a cop car that it looped back around to being the most effective undercover vehicle imaginable. No one, absolutely no one, would suspect the bright pink Cybertruck. Still in shock, Courtney walked a slow circle around the back, just to confirm. Yep, badge. Yep, county police. The sheer audacity of it was brilliant. And, she had to admit, the color actually made the notoriously brutalist design of the Cybertruck look... cute. Then, a movement inside the fast-food restaurant caught her peripheral vision. The doors swung open, and two police officers were walking her way. This was not the time or place to be caught gawking at a pink police vehicle, no matter how magnificent. What if they follow me, looking for any reason to pull me over? I was terrified, ""Right,"" she muttered to herself, adjusting her pace. ""Real quick, goodbye."" I didn't even give the pink titan one last, admiring glance, knowing I need to be anywhere but there. Advertising Her walk transformed into a brisk, purposeful stride, eyes fixed straight ahead, as if she hadn't just witnessed the most gloriously absurd piece of law enforcement machinery in existence. She got in her Toyota Corolla and drove away before they came out and saw her, staring wide-eyed at their bright pink, surprisingly cute, undercover Cybertruck. Courtney says in the video. Here's me reading: It's an undercover cop car.' Imagine getting pulled over by a Cybertruck I was at a fast-food restaurant, and when I came out to get in my car, I realized, as I walked by a Tesla Cybertruck, that it was actually a police car. But, I would have never known, because it's bright pink! I've never seen a pink cop car, have you? I walked around the back, looked at the license plate, and sure enough, it has a sheriff's badge on the plate, and it's a county police vehicle...."

Dolly Parton built her whole country star persona around being glamorous. As a girl growing up in the Great Smoky Mountains, she didn't have a lot of examples of glamor to look to for inspiration. But there was a ""town tramp,"" as Parton calls her, who the ""9 to 5"" singer thought was the perfect picture of womanhood. It was this woman who largely inspired Parton's ideas of what glamor is. The ""Jolene"" singer posted a throwback photo recently of herself done up in true Dolly Parton style. Her hair is voluptuous and curly, her blush and eyeshadow are bright pink, and her pale pink dress is covered with sparkles and geometric shapes. Parton fit into the 80s perfectly. ""I feel glamorous on the inside, so I want to look like it on the outside. "" Parton captioned the post. Her fans, of course, agree, with one calling her the ""most glamorous country star ever."" ""You are the Queen/goddess of glamour and talent and beauty. Love you Dolly. FOREVER ,"" writes another Instagram user, with another commenting, ""Dolly you are the definition of glamour always."" No matter the decade, Dolly Parton remains the gold standard for glamor in country music.

ca451586cd80a567063157cf0ca5e71a,2025-07-04 06:31:00,pl,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pl]Piwonia, nazywana często królową kwiatów, od wieków zachwyca swoim niezwykłym pięknem i bogatą symboliką. Jej zapach w perfumach to prawdziwa kwiatowa uczta — świeży, lekko słodki, delikatnie pudrowy. Dlaczego warto sięgnąć po piwoniowe perfumy? Jak wybrać idealny zapach z nutą piwonii i jakie marki królują na rynku w 2025 roku? Zapraszamy do kwiatowego świata piwonii — esencji świeżości i elegancji. Piwonia w kulturze i historii perfum Piwonia od wieków zajmuje ważne miejsce w kulturze wielu narodów. W Chinach symbolizuje szczęście, bogactwo i honor, a w Europie kojarzona jest z miłością i delikatnością. W perfumerii piwonia pojawiła się już w klasycznych kompozycjach, ale dziś to jeden z najmodniejszych kwiatowych zapachów. Jej obecność w perfumach łączy tradycję z nowoczesnością, nadając aromatom wyjątkowej lekkości i romantyzmu. Charakterystyka zapachu piwonii Zapach piwonii to niezwykła kombinacja świeżości i słodyczy. Lekko pudrowy i kwiatowy aromat łączy się często z nutami piżma, frezji czy różowego pieprzu, tworząc kompozycję pełną życia i kobiecej energii. To zapach uniwersalny – sprawdzi się zarówno na co dzień, jak i na wyjątkowe okazje, dodając subtelnej elegancji. Piwoniowe perfumy – dla kogo? Zapach piwonii w perfumach pokocha każda kobieta ceniąca delikatność i świeżość. Idealny na wiosnę i lato, pasuje do romantycznych wyjść, ale też do codziennego użytku. To propozycja dla osób, które szukają lekkiego, ale wyrazistego zapachu, podkreślającego naturalność i wdzięk. Najpopularniejsze piwoniowe perfumy w 2025 roku W 2025 roku na rynku królują zarówno luksusowe, jak i bardziej przystępne cenowo piwoniowe perfumy. Warto zwrócić uwagę na takie marki jak: - Chloé Love Story Eau Sensuelle – subtelna piwonia z nutami pomarańczy i paczuli. - Jo Malone Peony & Blush Suede – klasyczna, elegancka kompozycja z czerwonym jabłkiem i jaśminem. - Mancera Peony Deluxe – intensywna, luksusowa mieszanka piwonii z nutami piżma i ambry. - Byredo Peony Noir – wyrafinowany zapach łączący piwonię z czarną porzeczką i fiołkiem. - Viktor & Rolf Flowerbomb — bogaty kwiatowy bukiet z piwonią, jaśminem i różą. - Guerlain Aqua Allegoria Peonia Rosa — lekka i świeża piwonia z nutami różowego pieprzu i białej herbaty. - Dolce & Gabbana Peony Eau de Parfum — nowoczesna interpretacja piwonii z nutami róży i maliny. - Penhaligon's Peoneve — klasyczna piwonia z akcentami fiołka i białego piżma. - Hermes Jour d'Hermes — delikatna piwonia z nutami zielonego jabłka i białych kwiatów. Tom FordPrivate Blend Peony & Blush Suede — elegancki, luksusowy zapach łączący piwonię z czerwonym jabłkiem i nutami skóry.- L'Artisan Parfumeur La Chasse aux Papillons — subtelna piwonia z nutami cytrusowymi i jaśminem. - Miu Miu L'Eau Rosé — świeża piwonia i cytrusowa nuta limonki z akcentem piżma. - Acqua di Parma Peonia Nobile — wyrafinowany zapach z piwonią, białym pieprzem i paczulą. - Maison Francis Kurkdjian A la rose — chociaż to głównie róża, to w tle wyczuwalna delikatna piwonia. - Diptyque Eau Rose — piękna róża z akcentami piwonii i agrestu. - The Different Company Peony — niszowy zapach, w którym piwonia jest gwiazdą kompozycji. - Bvlgari Omnia Pink Sapphire — owocowo-kwiatowy zapach z nutą piwonii. - Elizabeth Arden Green Tea Peony — lekki, energetyczny zapach z zieloną herbatą i piwonią. Jak odróżnić naturalne piwoniowe perfumy od syntetycznych? Naturalne piwoniowe perfumy wyróżnia głębia i złożoność aromatu, którą trudno osiągnąć przy pomocy syntetycznych składników. Zapach jest bardziej ""żywy"", zmienia się na skórze, oferując bogactwo nut zapachowych. Warto zwracać uwagę na skład perfum – naturalne ekstrakty i certyfikaty ekologiczne to dobry znak jakości. Syntetyczne perfumy mogą być bardziej jednorodne i intensywne, ale często brakuje im naturalnej lekkości piwonii. Jak wybrać i nosić piwoniowe perfumy? Perfumy z piwonią najlepiej aplikować na punkty pulsujące, takie jak nadgarstki, szyja czy za uszami, co pomaga wydobyć pełnię aromatu. Trwałość piwoniowych perfum bywa różna, dlatego warto wybierać wersje z koncentracją eau de parfum. Przechowywać je należy z dala od światła i ciepła, by nie straciły swoich walorów. Połączenie z delikatnym kremem o neutralnym zapachu może dodatkowo podkreślić kwiatową nutę. Porównanie piwoniowych perfum z innymi kwiatowymi zapachami W porównaniu do róży, która jest bardziej intensywna i klasyczna, piwonia oferuje lżejszą, bardziej pudrową świeżość...."

1lrd6fq,2025-07-04 08:00:09,en,REDDIT,"  # Chapter 1 Dimention-Hopping Deep in a lush, ancient forest, three suns blazed high in the sky, their golden rays piercing through the dense plants. Sunlight dappled the forest floor and scattered across the pale, delicate face of Nyx Voss. Her slight and frail frame curled up in sleep spoke volumes that her body was starved of nourishment, and her soul was desperate for safety. Nearby, a magnificent tiger lounged lazily and looked like a silent guardian to the fragile figure. Not far off, a sprawling wolf pack kept a vigilant watch. The alpha perched closest to Nyx, its piercing vertical pupils betraying an unexpected softness as they lingered on her. In the shadows of the underbrush, several sleek leopards prowled quietly, their sharp eyes sweeping the surroundings, poised to defend against any threat to Nyx's peaceful slumber. Then, something happened. The deafening roar of engines shattered the tranquility, sending flocks of birds scattering into the sky and small creatures scurrying for cover. A massive spacecraft began its descent, breaking through the tree line and sending shockwaves of unease rippling through the forest. Yet the wild beasts surrounding Nyx held their ground. They showed their dangerous teeth and made low snarls in their throats, as if they had turned on the battle mode to drive this metallic intruder out of their territory. The ship landed with a mechanical hiss, its bulk settling on the ground. The hatch opened, and a squad of heavily armed soldiers emerged in formation, their boots crunching against the forest floor. They moved with practiced precision. Their mission was to extract the precious resources owned by the empire's military on this planet. This was a long-term mission and almost like routine work for the soldiers. Yet today, they stumbled onto something they couldn't have prepared for. ""Uh... Are those... wild beasts?"" one soldier murmured, staring slack-jawed at the surreal sight. ""Tigers, wolves, and leopards? What kind of wild soap opera is this?"" another added incredulously. It didn't take a zoologist to know that different species didn't make friends, and those apex wild beasts would never show up in the same picture. By nature, they were highly territorial and should have been at each other's throats upon meeting. Yet here they were, coexisting in an oddly harmonious way. ""Look! They're circling something. Is it some kind of treasure?"" one of them whispered. Speculation ran wild as they squinted into the cluster of animals. ' Is it some kind of rare mineral? Or maybe some valuable plants attract these beasts to guard them?' The soldiers edged closer, trying not to provoke an attack. The beasts became more bristled. They kept making low growls to stop the soldiers from approaching them. But then, through the gaps in the protective circle, the soldiers finally caught a glimpse of what lay in the middle. ""Holy shit! That's... a female,"" one soldier shouted. ""A female! Oh my! Am I dreaming?"" another stammered, as if they'd just spotted a unicorn in a city park. Someone else asked, ""This is insane! What the hell is a female doing on a Primitive Planet?"" ""Everybody, chill. Let's drive the wild beasts away. Don't let them hurt her,"" someone else chimed in. The soldiers tread carefully, opting not to use their weapons...."

La Roche-Posay Anthelios SPF 40 Tinted Sunscreen, aka the ""holy grail"" of tinted sunscreens — reviewers love this lightweight, buildable formula so much that a lot of them replaced their foundation with it altogether. If you're in the market for some subtle but effective coverage that won't get goopy or settle in pores, this is your sunscreen match made in heaven. Psst, you can find the Attitude Oceanly Lip Balm that reviewer is wearing on Amazon! Promising review: ""Like a lot of women over 50 I prefer to use a tinted sunscreen instead of foundation these days. I have tried a dozen, and this one is the winner, hands down! It has a thin, non-greasy texture, no odor, and is lightweight and buildable if you want a little more coverage in certain areas. Best of all it does not settle in to pores or fine lines at all. So many of the others I've tried, including high-end expensive ones that are pushed heavily on social media, are greasy and settle into every pore and line. I've put this on auto ship and hope it never gets discontinued!"" —Chartwell Price: $39.99 (available in four tinted and non-tinted) 3. Lottabody's Coconut Oil Foaming Curl Mousse designed for all hair types to give you satisfyingly hydrated, volumized, frizz-free curls at a FRACTION of the price of its competitors. Promising review: ""I have super frizzy, curly hair and live in New England, where we have super humid summers. I have been struggling to find a product that de-frizzes my hair without making it look oiled down, and this is it. I put it in my wet hair after washing, towel dried, and put my hair in a ponytail to go to work. My hair was frizz-free all night — even working outside in high humidity. People even asked if I did something to my hair! This is an amazing product for the price. Absolutely buying again and would recommend to anyone with a frizz issue."" —Marissa Price: $3.98 4. Clinique Almost Lipstick Tinted Lip Balm in *PINK* Honey — aka, the sweet, subtle sister of the iconic ""Black Honey"" that has been so popular over the past few decades that it just about broke TikTok when it finally had its moment over there. The skin tone-matching, pH-adaptive pink version is every bit as buildable, polished, and decadent feeling as the original black honey, and perfect for everyday makeup looks. The ""Almost Lipsticks"" are also well-known for working as a subtle lip *and* blush shade for a perfectly dewy, au naturelllll look! Promising review: ""This lip color is a fantastic, no-fuss lip product for those who want a natural, effortless look. It offers the best of both world s— hydrating balm and a hint of color — making it ideal for daily wear. It's perfect for those looking for a low-maintenance, lightweight lip option with a natural finish. While it may not be the longest-lasting product, its comfort and versatility make it a great addition to any beauty routine.""..."

A SeoulCeuticals toner mist that's like hitting your skin with a tall glass of spa water. It's packed with cucumber extract, marine minerals, and aloe to help calm redness, hydrate deeply, and keep acne at bay. It's lightweight and soothing, so you may let out a deep ""ahhh"" as you spritz this on. Plus, your skin will look dewy and ~radiant~. SeoulCeuticals is a small skincare business that was founded in 2017 by a husband and wife team. Promising review: ""I seriously am a believer in this whole line! I have turned family members, coworkers, and friends into using this product!!! I would always get cystic acne on my face. Since using the serum and essence, I hardly have breakouts, I have clearer skin, and less scarring! I LOVE this stuff and will buy this forever. :) Oh, and the smell is amazing!!!"" —Tiffany Promising review: ""I was actually hesitant to buy this product because I figured it could just be hyped-up fancy water. It is NOT. For me, at least, it is a miracle in a bottle! For the past few years, I've suffered from dry, flaky, rough skin. I had found some products that would help to some degree, but none that would eliminate the problem. Well, when I tried another product in this line (the snail repair cream), I noticed a BIG difference. HOWEVER, when I added this product to my regimen? Holy guacamole, Batman! My skin is SO soft, hydrated, and SMOOTH! My foundation (well, CC cream) goes on like a dream! The two products together worked wonders, BUT even when I use this product alone with absolutely nothing else (out of sheer laziness, mind you), my skin still looks dewy, smooth, hydrated, and glowing! I'm sold! If I could give it 10 stars, I would. It even helps keep my normally dry, chapped, peeling lips baby smooth! Life changing, I tell ya."" —M. Joiner Get it from Amazon for $19.98 (available in two versions). 2. A Mise En Scene lightweight hair serum, which deeply nourishes and hydrates damaged hair thanks to a combination of camelia, jojoba, and olive oils. Your locks will look silkier, feel softer, and smell amazing! Check out why BuzzFeed Shopping writer Gabriela Manjarrez *loves* this: ""Having written about *so* much K-beauty, I feel like I've written about every Korean product under the sun. However, this serum only recently came into my radar through a sample box — and thank goodness it did! Coincidentally, I received this just before embarking on a three-week European adventure and decided to take this with me. I have veryyy prone-to-frizz 2c hair, and through all of the different cities and varying climates, this serum kept my hair soft, silky, and (mercifully!) frizz-free. I dare say I'll be keeping this in my hair regimen forever. Not to mention, it leaves your hair smelling absolutely delightful!"" Promising review: ""The scent is nice. I'd give this 10 stars if I could. I've been using salon products for over a decade, and this is way better. And cheaper. I've even gotten compliments on how silky smooth my hair looks. I put it on while my hair is wet, then again when I style, if my hair gets frizzy from my flat-iron, and to tame flyaways. It's my favorite hair product I own."" —Amy Wilt Get it from Amazon for $18.99+ (available in two sizes, a mist style, and five other formulas)...."

n1kcjeb,2025-07-06 01:28:49,en,REDDIT,"  Old Favs: I've been leaning into Summer colors, and blues are a particular favorite of mine. I broke out my Sailor Moon palettes from Colourpop yesterday and tried to do a cute little periwinkle + peach sky vibe. It turned out alright! Adding Chanel's Beige Lumiere gave it some much needed light. Colourpop does do pastels pretty well, but I did make sure to wear MAC's eye primer. New Favs: Guerlain's Emerald Feathers palette -- I just couldn't resist, and omg. If you were thinking of getting Lisa Eldridge's vs this one, I'd go for Guerlain's, BUT the green is more intense in Guerlain's vs LE's true khaki, plus you have a little more options with LE. Still, this made the green / gold in my brown eyes pop! I had 1 person tell me I looked great, and my Door Dash driver was flirting with me, lol! Idk if it was the eyeshadow but woo. Lancome's Juicy Tube in Lavender Latte -- I think this is beautiful and with that peachy-blue look I mentioned, I paired this over top of Romand's Juicy Lasting Tint in Mulled Peach. I was an OG fan of these back in the day, so I knew I'd grab one eventually. I will say I do not like the floral taste of this. It has a fruity scent, but a floral taste. No matter how I try, I can't get into flowers in tea, vape juice, food, and now makeup. They don't belong in my mouth, lol. After a bit you don't notice it though, and these do adhere well because they're a little sticky, but in the right way, not the uncomfy kind. Fenty's Smurfette Gloss Bomb -- This is PURPLE, and the sparkles in this are way more intense than Lancome's. Also adheres well, but does feel heavy. Not a good thing to apply before bed because my lips felt gross in the morning, lol! It's really cute though and... Smurfette <3 Weird collab but I likey. Mid: The Saem's Jelly Blusher in Dusty Vine -- I love a dusty purple blush, and they are hard to find, since most go pink or disappear to nothing. This almost disappears to nothing. It's extremely faint. Worked great with my eyeshadow for a crease shade on that peachy-blue look, but primer is probs what made it pop out. You can build it, but it takes a lot. Nice for subtle dusty purple I suppose. Idk, I've never been impressed with any of The Saem's color products. Reminds of drug store I'd buy 15 years ago. Their under-eye concealer is insanely good though. Edit: And it's not a jelly. It's a matte powder. No shine. Idk what's up with the name, lol."

A minimalist dress, white shirt and tailored pants or a jumpsuit is such a chic and sophisticated base. It just takes the swipe of a bold lip to turn the understated into glamour. Here are five bold lip colours that add glamour to minimal outfits. We have handpicked a stunning collection of lipsticks that can instantly add glamour to your minimal outfits. Classic Red Want to look effortlessly chic in subtle outfits? A classic red lipstick must be on your list. It's universally flattering and instantly brightens your complexion.

Choose 458 - SENSUELLE from CHANEL or Ruby Woo from MAC to ace the look. Deep Burgundy If you want a moodier, more mysterious and incredibly chic look, go for deep berry or even Burgundy shades. Opt for 467 - PRÉCIEUSE from CHANEL and 696 Burgundy Blush from Maybelline; these shades deliver instant luxury and sophistication and are perfect for evening events. Fuchsia Pink If you're looking to add a playful touch to your outfit, a bright fuchsia pink is the way to go. Choose 122 - PLAY from CHANEL or MP1 Pink Perfect from Nykaa, the shades are full of a fun, energetic splash of electric colour that is youthful, modern, and fun. Fuchsia works well with basic attire like white, black, or light grey and gives you a pop of unexpected colour. Don't Miss: Deep Violet Want to get a different look that screams elegance? Choose deep violet lipstick from 468 - ÉLÉGANTE from CHANEL and Cyber from MAC, which offers richness and depth. These shades are sophisticated and particularly stunning with minimal outfits. Burnt Orange For a warm and highly fashionable statement, choose a burnt orange lip shade with your minimal or subtle outfits to exude a captivating look.

Email tips@dailymail.com Kristin Cavallari continued to flaunt her new breast implants as she sported a stylish swimsuit during a tropical getaway. The Hills alum, 38 - who confirmed that she underwent a recent boob job due to a scary health issue - jumped to her main Instagram page on Saturday as she posed on the sandy shore in the Bahamas. She sported a floral bikini top with a plunging neckline as well as a pair of matching drawstring bottoms. Cavallari slipped into a pair of Chloe slip-ons and allowed her blonde locks to flow down past her shoulders in light waves. The TV personality completed the look by adding a gold-chained necklace that offered a flashy flare. Kristin also took to her Instagram stories to further show off her toned figure while promoting her Uncommon James jewelry brand. In one snap, the mom-of-three stood in an open doorway as she wore a $38 cropped shirt that had 'Don't talk to me, I'm on vacation,' printed on the front. She also puckered her lips towards the camera for a quick selfie while showcasing the $62 gold necklace with a compass pendant. Kristin's makeup was glammed up for the photos, and comprised of a warm blush to her cheekbones as well as a pink tint to her lips. It comes not long after the reality star got candid about recently undergoing a new boob job. Back in late May, she opened up about the topic during an episode of her Let's Be Honest podcast. Cavallari explained at the time, 'My intuition was saying, redo your boobs. Go get your boobs checked out, at least a consultation.' She then went to a plastic surgeon located in Nashville who had 'seemed a little concerned' about her right implant. 'What we decided was, ""Okay, well, you get in there and see what's going on,"" because we knew something was up.' Kristin added, 'My boobs were not laying how I wanted them to lay, but just chalked it up to having the implants for eight years. Getting in to see the surgeon confirmed it was much more. 'He gets in there and I have a ruptured implant, and there is no way of knowing how long this implant was ruptured for.' She explained that, 'Because my implant was ruptured, my body then formed a huge piece of scar tissue around it, which is good because it, kind of, like, holds it all in place. It's your body's way of protecting itself. 'That's why my right boob was definitely not laying right. And it was f***ed up.' Cavallari said that she doesn't know when it all began. ' I have no idea how long that's been going on for. 'I guess, maybe, I could go through my camera roll and like try to figure out, like, when my boob started going a little f***ing cross-eyed.' After undergoing the procedure, Kristin has confidently showed off the new implants on social media. During her latest tropical vacation, the beauty further flashed her sculpted midriff in a fashionable bikini from Monday Swimwear in a post uploaded on Thursday. She struck a quick pose while also wearing Chloe slip-ons and a stylish sunhat on top of her head. Kristin was joined by her three children: Camden, 12, Jaxon, 10, and Saylor, nine, on the fun getaway. Both the star and her kids had a blast as they spent time at a swimming pool and also indulged in tasty meals. Cavallari was also accompanied by a few close pals, such as celebrity hair colorist Justin Anderson. In the caption of the photo series, she penned to her 4.9 million followers: 'Vacation mode with this Motley Crue.' She also gave her fans a glimpse into her Fourth of July celebrations in the Bahamas. Kristin sported a sleeveless, white dress that clung to her frame and sported red, white and blue necklaces as well as a festive headband. The star further showed off the outfit as she stepped into the cool water on the shore of a scenic beach. She flashed a big smile on her face as she gazed towards the camera for the lighthearted picture. Cavallari's three children also joined in on the Fourth of July by donning festive jewelry and star-shaped sunglasses. The Laguna Beach star shares her three children with former NFL player Jay Cutler - whom she was married to from 2013 until their divorce was finalized in June 2022."

tw_sl_159abe86df279afbb1d5d1063a44219d,2025-07-06 15:41:36,en,WEB,"  Geri Halliwell remains the only Spice Girls star not to have addressed Mel B's wedding publicly. All other members of the hit 90s girl band – Victoria Beckham, Mel C, and Emma Bunton – have expressed support and congratulations for their bandmate, whether it be on social media or by attending the ceremony itself. But as far as Geri is concerned, it's still radio silence. Yesterday, Scary Spice, 50, tied the knot with celebrity hairdresser Rory McPhee, to whom she got engaged in 2022. It was every inch a lavish affair, perhaps somewhat resembling a royal wedding, as a crowd formed outside St Paul's Cathedral to catch the pop star in her bespoke luxury gown. The guest list was truly star-studded, with Katherine Ryan, Alan Carr, Gaby Roslin, Cara Delevingne, and Daisy Lowe all on the guest list. Joining them was Emma, aka Baby Spice, who beamed with pride as she arrived wearing a sweet blush pink dress, accompanied by her partner, Jade Jones, and son, Beau. And while two other Spice Girls were unable to attend, Posh and Sporty made sure to wish Mel well before her big day. Taking to Instagram, fashion designer Victoria, who decided not to join the group for their last reunion tour in 2019, wrote: 'Congratulations @officalmelb @rorymcphee on your special day! I couldn't be more excited for you both and wish you a lifetime of happiness! kisses xx' The day before Mel's wedding, Victoria, who couldn't make it due to being on holiday, also wrote: 'Sending love to you @officialmelb! @rorymcphee is a very lucky man! xx' A source denied that there was an 'issue' or a 'falling out' causing Victoria to skip the wedding. It was just 'one of those things'. They added to the Daily Mail: 'Victoria has long-standing plans out of the country, and she simply can't be there. 'She adores Mel; they get on really well despite their paths going in opposite directions. It's a real shame.' Meanwhile, Mel C—full name Melanie Chisholm—said she was 'gutted' to miss out on the nuptials. Sharing a snap from the day, she wrote on Insta to the newlyweds: 'So so happy for you both and beyond gutted I couldn't be there. Excited to celebrate with you really soon! Yippee!' After Mel and Rory posted professional photos from their wedding in London, there were plenty of other celebs flooding the comments to say congratulations, including Paloma Faith, Sofia Vergara, Alexandra Burke, Ayda Field, Heidi Klum, and Terry Crews. While details on why Geri, 52, opted to skip the wedding are unknown, it's said that her colourful past with Mel had something to do with it. The former bandmates were once reportedly unable to be in the same room due to animosity between them and their tendency to fight. Then, when appearing on Piers Morgan's Life Stories, Mel added fuel to the fire with her bombshell confession that she and Geri had an intimate relationship during the band's early days. It's believed Geri was upset by the revelation, for which Mel never apologised. Her husband, Christian Horner, was also reportedly livid. When fellow Spice Girl Victoria had her big 50th birthday bash last year, Mel appeared to want to quash rumours of any bad blood. Initially, it was reported that her reunion with Geri was frosty, as they had a tense exchange before keeping their distance on the night. Still, Mel shared group snaps on Insta afterwards, writing: 'What an amazing girl power weekend with all my girls, i have soooo much love and respect for you ALL #friendshipneverends [sic]'. After saying 'I do' this weekend, Rory became Mel's third husband. She was previously married to Dutch dancer Jimmy Gulzar in 1998. Then, in 2007, she wed Stephen Belafonte when they eloped to Las Vegas. The couple parted ways in 2016 when Mel accused him of abuse, which he denied. Speaking about her now-husband, Rory, Mel previously told Us Weekly: 'He's a very confident man, and that, to me, is a man. He makes me feel so safe.' She later added to Hello! Magazine: 'For the first time in my life, I'm engaged to a beautiful, honest person who makes me feel protected, nurtured and so loved, and I want to savour that.' Got a story?

mov_B58F2493E0835F8513A519F3C794AE3D,2025-07-07 11:01:04,en,WEB,"  This blurring powder is basically pure witchcraft and your *best* weapon against heat and humidity. And no, it's not the $59 Givenchy version. 1. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder, which is SO GOOD at eliminating shine and blurring pores that I feel like it'd smirk at you and go, ""How 'bout that, huh? "" if it had a human form. If you dread summer because you love wearing makeup but the heat and humidity leave it looking patchy, this'll lock it in with a smooth, semi-matte finish. Your oily T-zone doesn't know what's coming for it. One reviewer compares this to a $59 Givenchy powder! Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""This is the secret for makeup in hot and humid climates! I am a sweaty person, but I also love wearing makeup regardless of the weather. While holidaying in Southeast Asia at the start of wet season, I faced temperatures between 35 and 40 degrees Celsius (95–104 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity. After finishing my base makeup, I applied this powder all over. I did not use a setting spray because most break me out. Luckily, no setting spray was necessary while using this setting powder! It kept my foundation and cream blush from separating or becoming patchy, and also kept me from being too shiny. I reapplied a couple of times per day. This is magical and I will definitely be using regularly during the summers in North America too!"" —Sara Lima Get it from Amazon for $25. 2. A smocked midi dress because Hill House's Nap Dress is truly ~dreamy~ but your bank account is like, ""Um, we still need to buy groceries."" This cutie's a fraction of the cost and just as gorgeous, not to mention breathable as heck thanks to its 100% organic cotton poplin fabric. Prepare to fall head over heels for this dress — I definitely did. I recently wore this dress (in shade Lipstick Pink) to an outdoor wedding and I. AM. OBSESSED. It hugs my frame beautifully with the stretchy smocked waist — I can even get away with not wearing a bra, though for context I'm a B cup — and the flowy bottom of the dress sits just right. I personally haven't tried Hill House's Nap Dress (I drool over the designs, but $178 is a little too steep for me), but I'm perfectly happy to stock up on this dress in a few colors for around the same price. My colleague Heather Braga, on the other hand, is a Hill House devotee — but even she was impressed by this cheaper option: ""Listen, I am the proud owner of NINE Hill House Nap Dresses. I condone splurging on them (truly, by all means) and will be the first to tell you they are worth every penny. That being said, I tried out one of these from Quince and LOVE it. I have the Tribeca Stripe pattern and cannot believe how similar it feels to the other brand. It's my current go-to style for my frame (two kids in two years, send prayers) and is one of the few things I know I can throw on and KNOW I look great. Will definitely add another to an upcoming order and have been shouting from the rooftops how wonderful this brand fits."" Get it from Quince for $69.90 (available in sizes XS–XL and nine styles). 3. E.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen if you're still trying to find a daily sunscreen you don't despise. This clear gel sunscreen offers SPF 35 and goes on so smooth and lightweight, you'll immediately forget you're wearing it — no white cast here, folks. It doubles as a blurring primer, so it's great for wearing under makeup too! If you love Supergoop but the price is becoming hard to swallow...may I suggest trying this, because it's *very* similar. The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop's cult-fave product end. I've tried both, and I honestly prefer this E.l.f. version. Supergoop's had a slight graininess to it that I didn't love, while this E.l.f. sunscreen is exactly what I'd hoped Supergoop's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top!..."

1ltyrrl,2025-07-07 16:30:12,en,REDDIT,"  Jax's nightmare; ""What?! Wh-Where am I?"" He stares into the dark void. Next thing he knows, everybody's gathered around him in... oh no. A corn maze. A damned corn maze. ""(Honk)! Why are we here? ... Where's my voice?"" He steps forward towards the direction of one of the exits and Zooble backs up horrified, ""Jax, calm down. Just relax."" They look defenseless with their hand and claw up. Jax steps towards them. They grab Gangle with a scream and run in the other direction. Ragatha, who was just standing in place speaks up, ""He's the last person I expected this to happen to, but I guess it makes sense considering where we are."" Jax is confused and still freaking out of the corn. He yells, ""Wait what?! What's going on?"" He grabs his now beating head. He yelps, ""Oww! What the (Boing)?!"" He looks around, ""No really, what is going on here?! What are we here?"" He starts to freak out, getting slightly angrier. ""Which way is the right way?! Come on Cain, get me out of here!"" He screams. He accidentally bumps into Kinger and the chess piece collapses. ""King, are you okay? Kinger?!"" His body lies there motionless. ""Oh no... does that mean??? (Boing)!"" Jax tries to look down at his hands, then his feet. Where are his feet?! Where is his body?! What's going on. He grabs KoKo, hoping she could offer him some sense of comfort. The moments he touches her, her eyes bulge out of her face, her teeth all fall out one after the other. Blood pours out of her ears and she melts in the eye-filled black blob that is now his new body. He's abstracted...

1lu22f0,2025-07-07 18:33:29,en,REDDIT,"  Hi everyone! I'm looking for a very simple mobile game I played around 2013–2015 on Android. Here's what I remember: - 2D flat graphics, simple style, like paper cut-out or drawing - Main character: girl with medium brown hair in a ponytail, kind of Barbie style but with other colors, not all pink - Gameplay: the girl asks you to find specific makeup items in a single store scene (e.g. ""sparkly blue lipstick,"" ""purple blush"") - You just click/tap the requested items, no running, no animations, no timer, no scores or levels - The game speaks in the phone's language (Portuguese if phone set to Brazil) - Only one fixed store background, no other scenes or levels It's NOT: Beauty Idol, Fashion Icon, Star Girl, Shopping Mall Girl, Makeup Story, or similar drag-and-drop makeup games. If anyone recognizes this game or has any idea, I'd be so grateful! Thank you so much! ✨"

Lmk if you want me to remove some. In a rush this takes me 25 minutes, when I was first learning how to do this it took me an hour and a half- trust the process! (Edit do my makeup with me lmao. My foundation just came in… so I got the actual items down in right in the longer version). Items- Skincare (serum, moisturizer, spf) makeup- wait ~15 minutes. Primer, *I do brows here so they stick, brows welcome whenever you want as I touch up at the end- so powder brows & pencil* foundation, contour, cream bronzer, concealer *I add brown liquid eye-shadow/primer here* , liquid blush, (if layering and not underpainting) setting spray to blend.

mov_3D37899CF39CC8962B176D885888A397,2025-07-08 04:30:00,en,WEB,"  This year, Amazon Prime Day becomes Amazon Prime Days—you can score deals for four days (instead of two) to be exact, from now to July 11. It's the longest sale the mega-retailer has ever done, and the discounts are, as always, a doozy. For the last few weeks, I have been combing through thousands of beauty deals, and have come out the other side with the 59 best skin care, makeup, body care, and hair care must-haves you should shop before the sale ends. The lowest prices begin with a $4 body exfoliating brush that I consider necessary for smooth summer skin, and on the most expensive side, Shark's rarely-on-sale hair styler (which I've never seen this cheap before). You'll also find under-the-radar picks (Dearcloud's serum blush), top-rated products (L'Oreal's Lumi Glotion skin enhancer), celebrity-used favorites (Laura Geller's baked foundation), my go-tos (Medicube's exosome serum), and much more. Best Deals Overall It was hard enough to pare this list down to 59 products, and even more difficult to single out the nine best, but here they are. There are things like Laneige's lip mask and Cosrx's snail mucin serum that you should always stock up on during sales, plus celebrity favorites like NuFace's microcurrent device, Naturium's body butter, and Supergoop's tinted primer. Naturium Skin-Renewing Retinol Body Lotion Amazon Naturium's body care is next-level, which has made fans of Hailey Bieber, Demi Moore and me. I'm going to pass on my usual order to try out this retinol body lotion. Besides the titular ingredient, there's allatonin and shea butter; it's an anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, cell-renewing, radiance-enhancing, moisturizing (whew) combination. Best Anti-Aging Skin Care Deals I know that everyone has different skin care concerns, but to paint with a broad brush, it's safe to say a lot of people are concerned with reducing and/or preventing signs of aging. As such, I have meticulously picked the 10 best on-sale anti-aging products for everything wrinkle, fine lines, and firmness-related. On the cheapest end of the spectrum, there's a $12 Medicube serum, and the most expensive—yet still incredibly affordable—is a $35 Eight Saints Eye Cream. L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer, $21 (Originally $30) Womaness Let's Neck Firming Serum, $26 (Originally $35) CeraVe Skin Renewing Anti-Aging Retinol Serum, $23 (Originally $25) Nakery Lift-Tox Night Repair and Firm Cream, $20 (Originally $35) Body Firm Crepe Erase Ultra-Reparative Hand Cream, $20 (Originally $26) Gold Bond Age Renew Retinol Overnight Body and Face Lotion, $14 (Originally $17) Medicube Salmon DNA PDRN Pink Peptide Serum, $15 (Originally $22) Medicube One Day Exosome Shot 2,000 Serum, $12 (Originally $39) Eight Saints Wonder-fill Plumping Eye Cream, $35 (Originally $44) CeraVe Skin Renewing Anti-Aging Retinol Serum Amazon If you have a singular anti-aging skin care product in your routine, it should be formulated with retinol. CeraVe's Skin Renewing Anti-Aging Retinol Serum is a great choice because when it comes time for a restock, at $23, it's still a steal. The titular retinol is a wrinkle-reducing, dark spot-fading, and skin-firming powerhouse. It's complemented by a trio of plumping ceramides and ultra-hydrating hyaluronic acid. One shopper said that their “forehead had deep lines” that were visible even when they weren't  “creasing [their] brow.” After a month of using this they noted they “can't see them” anymore. Medicube Salmon DNA PDRN Pink Peptide Serum Amazon This feels like a line from Saturday Night Live, but it's true: salmon sperm skin care is everywhere. This Medicube serum uses bits of DNA derived from the stuff and for more than just shock value. It improves firmness, texture, and hydration, and fast. This formula also includes niacinamide and vitamin C-rich holy basil, a duo that has wrinkle-filling and skin-brightening properties. A shopper in their late 60s “loves the way this has made [their] face look” by making wrinkles look “less noticeable.” Best Hair Growth Deals If you want perpetually long, thick, and healthy hair, it means (unless you are genetically gifted) that you must always be searching for and buying hair growth products. To ease the financial strain this may cause, I recommend stocking up during mega-sales like Prime Day. You can go with an obvious choice like the fervently loved Mielle Organics' oil, try a celebrity go-to treatment, or upgrade your shampoo and conditioner routine. Virtue Healing Hair Oil Amazon There is a high probability that this is the most popular hair care product in Hollywood. Off the top of my head, I can tell you its celebrity fans include Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Garner, and Anne Hathaway. This oil helps promote hair growth through a variety of healing (hence its name) ingredients, the most important of which is the brand's proprietary Alpha Keratin 60ku; think of it as a honing system that targets the strands and areas that need it the most...."

mov_99D80F1AE2996ADA77FD6762796C5305,2025-07-08 11:23:59,en,WEB,"  July 08 -- A quiet make over is sweeping through Indian interiors this year. Homeowners who once treated wall paint as an afterthought now see it as the quickest route to comfort, style, and wellness. Retailers from Kochi to Kanpur confirm that tins fly off the shelves within hours of a new shade launch, signaling a market that is wide awake to changing tastes. Early in the season, designers noticed a tilt toward softer, ground-inspired palettes. Terracotta, mellow olive, and pale sand dominate order books, reflecting a desire to bring nature indoors while keeping rooms calm. Manufacturers say the shift is partly driven by the use of chemical-safe formulas. With more families reading ingredient labels, demand for low-odour, low-VOC products has doubled in some outlets since January. Technology has also crept into paint cans. Several brands introduced dust-resistant and moisture-shield emulsions late last year, and those lines have grown steadily in metros where pollution spikes and monsoon humidity share the calendar. Contractors point out that a single coat of the new finish often replaces multiple touch-ups, cutting labour runs to a minimum. For apartment dwellers juggling work-from-home schedules, saving matters as much as the colour itself. Accent walls remain the simplest route to personality. Instead of covering every surface, many households opt for a bolder treatment by selecting one panel: a deeper tone, a brushed texture, or a cultural motif inspired by regional art. The strategy keeps repaint costs low while giving each room a focal point. Paint advisors reveal that a navy portal behind a bookshelf or a block-print inspired stripe in the dining zone can raise resale value without extensive refurbishment. New habits around space have triggered another twist. Hybrid living — study corner by day, family lounge by evening — encourages colour zoning. Homeowners mark a quiet nook with a cool pastel and leave the rest of the hall in a warmer neutral, creating mental boundaries without building walls. The approach is popular in Bengaluru's start-up suburbs, where multi-purpose rooms are the norm. The lounge itself is witnessing more layered blends. The on-trend living room wall colour combination pairs sage green with creamy white, offering a soft backdrop that flatters wood and wicker. Close behind is the partnership of blush pink and charcoal grey, a contrast that adds depth yet avoids glare. Decor consultants advise clients to let lighting guide the final call: morning sun brightens cooler hues, while evening LEDs enrich deeper shades. For residents planning a refresh, specialists offer three simple checks. First, paint a test patch and observe it throughout the day; bright noon glare and warm evening bulbs can make the same pigment look worlds apart. Second, never skip a primer — it locks colour, saves extra coats and keeps the finish truer for longer. Third, anchor every daring choice with quieter companions so that fabrics, rugs, and future accessories still fit. The story of India's wall paint market in 2025 is, at its core, a story of people seeking practical ways to feel at ease. Whether the goal is a restful bedroom, a productive desk corner, or a welcoming social hub, colour has become the fastest, most flexible tool. Walls are talking more than ever before, and their language is one of warmth, well-being, and quiet confidence."
mov_702EFCDB11C00057077A318415183260,2025-07-08 11:55:42,en,WEB,"  The French President touched down at RAF Northolt on July 8, kick-starting a three-day state visit which makes history as the first EU head of state to make a UK state visit since Brexit. And further history was to be made on the runway by Catherine, , who joined William, Prince of Wales, in greeting the president and his wife, . The princess opted for a blush pink outfit from the French house of , which is thought to be the first time she has ever worn an outfit from the brand once beloved by her late mother-in-law, Princess Diana. Keen to keep focus on British-based designers, the Princess of Wales is far more likely to be seen wearing garments by the likes of Alexander McQueen, Jenny Packham, Erdem or Alessandra Rich. But today, Kate decided to make a point. Her landmark outfit is a take on Christian Dior's famous 1947 New Look, a bar jacket and full skirt which shocked French society at the time, marking an end of World War II austerity with its cinched, feminine waist and elegant skirt cut from extravagant amounts of wool crepe fabric. She finished her look with a hat by Jess Collett, earrings which were owned by Diana, and a three-strand pearl necklace from Queen Elizabeth II's collection. The exact design worn by Catherine was designed by Dior's former creative director Maria Grazia Chiuri, who was inspired by the original. Brigitte Macron, meanwhile, opted for an all white midi-length dress with gold buckles on either side of the waist, and button detailing from the shoulder to waist. Following a horse-drawn carriage procession through Windsor with the Prince and Princess of Wales, the couple will sit for lunch at Windsor Castle with King Charles, Queen Camilla, and members of the Royal Family. Later, key events for visit include wreath-laying at Westminster Abbey and a visit to Queen Elizabeth II's tomb at St. George's Chapel. There will be a State banquet at Windsor Castle and Macron will also address both Houses of Parliament in the Royal Gallery. Kate's appearance on the tarmac comes as a welcome sight to royal fans, who will have been missing her during the past week of Wimbledon, where she is well-known for her courtside looks. Her style prowess was also missed at Royal Ascot, from which she pulled out at the last minute. It is anticipated that the Princess of Wales may still attend Wimbledon at a later date, with the royal having traditionally presented the winner of the tournament with their trophy in recent years. The tournament runs until July 13. All the best looks from the French state visit"

Three different patterns – black and white houndstooth, earthy brown, and pink blush – were woven by home-based weavers on the rugged moorland coast of Lewis and finished at the Shawbost Mill. STV News obtained an exclusive preview of the iconic sports shoe as the first pairs were unwrapped in Scotland following a transatlantic delivery. Nike x Harris Tweed Hebrides Margaret Ann Macleod, CEO of Harris Tweed Hebrides, says the partnership brings together contemporary design and traditional craftsmanship, rooted firmly in the culture and heritage of the Outer Hebrides of Scotland. “This collection highlights how our island's most famous export Harris Tweed continues to deliver the modernity and the sustainability credentials to attract global design-led businesses, like Nike,” she said. The 18-month development project with Nike is a significant milestone for Harris Tweed Hebrides. The mill employs over 70 people and supports over 100 home weavers, making it a major economic contributor in the Outer Hebrides. Nike x Harris Tweed Hebrides The company also collaborates with high-profile fashion houses like Dior, emphasising the premium quality and authenticity of Harris Tweed. The Nike Dunk Low Harris Tweed collection will be available worldwide later in 2025 via the Nike website and selected retail partners. Each pair will retail for $135 – around £100. The trainers display the official Harris Tweed Orb label, a mark of authenticity and provenance. Harris Tweed Hebrides is widely credited with the revitalisation of the Harris Tweed industry, which remains a vital component of the local economy of the Outer Hebrides. When the industry was at its lowest ebb, the firm re-opened a derelict mill in the rural village of Shawbost on the west side of Lewis and built a global business. Mrs Macleod highlighted the historical connection with Nike, dating back 20 years, and the company's focus on looking forward while maintaining its heritage. “We have built on the values of the original project, reflecting on Derick's stewardship at the Shawbost Mill at that time, to Donald John's remarkable response to Nike's call back in the early 2000's, this new trainer collaboration reflects an enduring partnership and an island legacy,” Mrs Macleod said. “Welcoming Nike back to the Shawbost Mill on the Outer Hebrides of Scotland after 20 years has been a proud moment for our local community.” The Nike Dunk Low Harris Tweed collection will be available worldwide later in 2025 via the Nike website and selected retail partners. The collaboration pays tribute to a defining moment in the modern story of Harris Tweed when in 2004, homeweaver Donald John Mackay received a landmark order from Nike for 10,000 metres of cloth. Recognising the scale of the opportunity, Donald John turned to Derick Murray, then owner of Shawbost Mill. Together, they rallied a network of over 50 island weavers to meet the demand — an effort now seen as one of the turning points in the revitalisation of the Hebridean textile industry.

mov_45688AE70917BAE0298ED0408F7FFD08,2025-07-08 15:20:10,en,WEB,"  Dior Spring/Summer 2026 Menswear Collection by Jonathan Anderson – A Bold New Vision Unveiled at Paris Fashion Week Dior SS26 Menswear by Jonathan Anderson – A Groundbreaking Fusion of Tradition and Avant-Garde The Dior Spring/Summer 2026 Menswear collection, unveiled during Paris Fashion Week, marked a historic moment for the house as celebrated designer Jonathan Anderson took the reins for the season. Known for his intellectual approach to fashion and his boundary-pushing work at JW Anderson and Loewe, Anderson brought a fresh, conceptual edge to the Dior Homme legacy—reimagining classic menswear through a lens of art, architecture, and innovation. Stepping into the shoes of Kim Jones for this season, Anderson delivered a collection that honored Dior's heritage while redefining it for a new era. The result? A spectacular runway presentation that blurred the lines between masculinity, elegance, and creative rebellion. A Palette of Poetic Power The SS26 color story was nothing short of cinematic. Soft creams and muted greys gave way to bursts of powder blue, citrus yellow, and Dior's signature blush pink. There was an intentional fragility in the tones—Anderson's way of challenging toxic masculinity and emphasizing vulnerability as strength. Silhouettes and Styling The collection played with proportion in ways both subtle and dramatic. Tailored suits came with fluid, exaggerated trousers and cropped, almost sculptural blazers. Iconic Dior bar jackets were re-engineered with a masculine structure, while transparent knits and draped silk shirts added an ethereal softness. Anderson's affinity for layering was on full display: sleeveless trenches were paired over sculpted tanks, and sheer tops floated beneath laser-cut coats. Accessories That Spoke Volumes Accessories were bold and unexpected—a nod to Anderson's mastery of playful provocation. Oversized leather totes embossed with surrealist motifs, chunky jewelry inspired by nature's imperfections, and sleek reinterpretations of the classic Dior Saddle Bag elevated the looks with a distinct personal touch. Fabrics and Craftsmanship True to the Dior ethos, craftsmanship was at the heart of the collection. Luxurious fabrics like silk organza, jacquard, raw linen, and recycled cotton were treated with meticulous care. Embroidery details took inspiration from Jean Cocteau's sketches and mid-century surrealist art, paying homage to Christian Dior's friendships and muses. The Show's Setting: A Spatial Masterpiece Staged inside a geometric, light-filled dome set in the gardens of the Musée Rodin, the runway setting itself became part of the narrative. As models moved through pools of reflective light and shadows, the space amplified Anderson's themes of fluidity, contrast, and artistic expression. A New Chapter for Dior Homme? Whether this collection signals a longer-term partnership between Jonathan Anderson and Dior Homme remains to be seen, but one thing is clear—SS26 was a statement season. It challenged convention, elevated menswear beyond tailoring, and infused the house with a daring artistic sensibility. In a post-show interview, Anderson stated: “This was about emotion and energy. Dior has always stood for beauty and revolution, and I wanted to interpret that through a modern, masculine lens.” With Dior SS26, Jonathan Anderson didn't just design clothes—he created a conversation."
mov_CFCA1CD92806DCC352486E3382C1123A,2025-07-08 16:52:05,en,WEB,"  Welcome to SELF Checkout, a series in which we share the wellness-boosting products currently in our carts. In each installment, you can expect to find our staffers' essentials as well as genuinely useful splurges and group-chat-worthy finds. I was raised to shop in bulk (shout out to my mother, who once bought a dozen bags of pretzels because they were on sale, even though no one in our family really liked them). So I naturally view Amazon Prime Day as the perfect opportunity to stock up on the essentials I always end up running low on (hello, dog poop bags, toothbrush heads, deodorant, and coffee filters). But I also recognize Prime Day's value as a time to save on what would otherwise be a pricey purchase (like, say, a vacuum). Luckily, you can fit both types of items in your Amazon cart and still save a nice chunk of change. Even luckier, the retailer has extended its biggest sale of the year by two extra days—so you can shop a little today, then come back for more tomorrow, Thursday, and Friday. Not sure where to start? We're keeping track of all the best deals right here. And below, you can see what we're adding to our own carts this Prime Day. Scroll down for some wellness editor-approved shopping inspo. Sarah Felbin, SELF's senior commerce editor Amazon Smart Plug To make her life a little easier (and more futuristic), Felbin stocks up on these smart plugs. “I can control them remotely using the Amazon Alexa app on my phone—meaning I can turn my A/C on from miles away, so my apartment is nice and cool by the time I get home,” she says. “They're also great for lights—you can turn them on hands-free, just ask Alexa.” Dr. Loretta Intense Replenishing Serum Felbin, who has “super sensitive skin,” also loves how thick and nourishing this hydrating serum feels. “It's a little pricey, but it usually goes on sale for Prime Day, so you can bet it's in my cart,” she says. “Two pumps is enough for my face and neck, and even though the bottle is pretty small, it lasts a while.” Therabody TheraFace Pro Curious about red light therapy, microcurrent treatments, or facial massage? You can get a feel for all three with the SELF Healthy Beauty Award–winning TheraFace Pro. You'll be in good company, as Felbin will likely add one to her cart this year too: “Lots of SELF staffers love theirs, and I'm thinking Prime Day is the perfect time to take the plunge and grab one for myself,” she says. “Girl math says it'll save me hundreds on pricey treatments and facials later down the road.” Her logic is sound. Milk Makeup Lip + Cheek Stick Like me, Felbin's using Prime Day to restock her old reliables, including Milk's super versatile blush stick. “I love the color Werk—it's a really pretty pink that gives me the perfect, natural-looking flush,” she says, adding she may give the Quirk and Dash shades a try too. Jessica Kasparian, SELF's commerce writer Apple AirPods Pro 2 Kasparian basically lives in her AirPods: “I seriously wear them every single day to listen to music and podcasts, take calls, and drown out NYC noise.” Her trusty old pair have gone kaput, so she's using Prime Day as an opportunity to upgrade to a pair of Pro 2s. “My boyfriend and I use our Nespresso coffee maker every day, and restocking on pods can get pricey,” Kasparian explains. Buying up their favorite flavors while they're 20% off should help. Moroccanoil Luminous Hairspray Medium In the name of reducing heat wave-induced frizz, Kasparian will be bringing Moroccanoil's Luminous hairspray back into her routine. “I used to use this hairspray years ago and have been missing it lately, as the summer humidity has been wreaking havoc on my hair,” she says. “It's a fine mist that leaves my hair looking shiny, and I love its fresh scent.” Cyklar Nutrient Rich Body Cream “I can't get enough of this Cyklar Nutrient Rich Body Cream—I love the Sacred Santal and Vanilla Verve scents,” Kasparian says. She's overdue for a restock—and while she's at it, she may give the matching body wash a try too. Sara Coughlin, SELF's senior commerce writer..."

Although the Princess of Wales is known for her signature long brunette waves, she's slowly been making her way over to the blonde side the past few months, first debuting a lighter shade of brunette in May. During a stylish appearance at the British Fashion Council awards, Princess Kate showed off a new bronde color which she also wore on an anniversary trip to Scotland with Prince William later that same month. But now, it seems she's taken things even blonder. On July 8, Princess Kate stepped out with Prince William to welcome President Macron and his wife for their official state visit to Britain. For the occasion, her hair color was an all-over honey blonde color that complimented her blush Christian Dior outfit nicely. With her pink tulle skirt and blonde hair, she's very much giving royal Carrie Bradshaw.

(Photo by Max Mumby/Indigo/) Max Mumby/Indigo/ Honey blonde, also known as cozy blonde, has been one of the biggest hair color trends of the moment, appearing on celebs like Zendaya, Rihanna, and Kim Kardashian. As for what makes this color so appealing? It fits right in with the rise of low-maintenance hair colors. “Cozy blonde is a term used to describe a super-low-maintenance approach to being a blonde,” says , celebrity hair-extension artist and Wella master color expert. “The look embraces more depth in the hair with lowlights and strategic placement of lighter blonde shades, allowing for a low-maintenance blonde that works for any season.” It's especially great for anyone transitioning from brunette to blonde and vice versa, like Kate Middleton. “Anyone who feels a little washed out from the overall brightness [of their blonde] usually transitions very well into wearing this look,” Cleveland says, as do those who are tired of upkeep that is too time-consuming, expensive, or damaging. “In this case, your stylist can create a cozy blonde that gives you the best of both worlds.” Originally Appeared on Glamour"

Kate will join the King, the Queen, the Prince of Wales and some 160 guests at Windsor Castle for the white tie affair, the glittering highlight of the French state visit, on Tuesday evening. President of France Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte are being feted with the opulent display of royal hospitality in the historic St George's Hall. Kate, who was diagnosed with cancer in 2024 and confirmed she was free from the disease at the start of this year, last made an appearance at a grand royal dinner 20 months ago in November 2023, in honour of the South Korean president. Last week, she opened up about her “rollercoaster” cancer recovery, its life-changing impact, and putting on a “brave face” during a visit to Colchester Hospital. Kensington Palace confirmed the princess would be present after she carried out royal duties to mark the start of the state visit earlier in the day, accompanying the Macrons to Windsor with William, taking part in the carriage ride, the ceremonial welcome, the royal luncheon and Royal Collection exhibition. The princess has already channelled diplomatic royal dressing in honour of the King's guests, choosing to wear French fashion house Christian Dior for her daytime engagements. Her earrings belonged to Diana, Princess of Wales and the pearl necklace was from the late Queen's collection. The blush pink Christian Dior jacket is the 30 Montaigne Rose Des Vents Bar Jacket and a piece from the 2024 collection, and was paired with a tulle skirt. It was reimagined by Maria Grazia Chiuri, who was inspired by the original first created in 1947 by Dior himself. Kate's sleek hat was by Jess Collett. The princess was charmed with a kiss to the hand by Mr Macron as she and William met the French leader as he disembarked from his plane at RAF Northolt. Mr Macron took the princess's hand and leaned forward to deliver an air kiss towards it. Meanwhile, the President warmly shook the prince's hand and held onto his arm as they chatted. State banquets have moved from the Buckingham Palace ballroom to Windsor for the next few years while reservicing work at the London royal residence continues and starts to affect the state rooms. Kate has attended a handful of engagements in recent months including Trooping the Colour, the annual Order of the Garter service and a visit to a V&A storage facility in London. But she missed Royal Ascot in June after seeking to find the right balance to public appearances following her cancer treatment."

I just want them to have a childhood.” Yet, recently Romy in particular, has been making her own mark on Hollywood. She attend a Marc Jacobs fashion show with Coppola in February 2020 before making her modeling debut in a Heaven by Marc Jacobs campaign later that year. And while she was previously known to not have public social media accounts, Romy went viral on TikTok in 2023 for sharing that she'd been grounded because she ""tried to charter a helicopter from New York to Maryland"" on her dad's credit card.

Korean Sunscreens By now, we know the importance of daily sun protection. However, finding a formula that's cosmetically elegant and agrees with your skin can be a long and difficult journey. The and Mixoon Bean Sunscreen are widely beloved for their texture and finish. Korean Hair and Body Care Your hair and body deserve a treat, too!

For a formal welcome ceremony at Windsor, she chose a bespoke blush pink suit by Christian Dior, an ensemble that not only looked stunning but also drew comparisons to the iconic Dior silhouette. The suit's shape was a nod to Dior's revolutionary 1947 ""New Look."" Emerging from the somber styles of the post-war era, Christian Dior's collection was a return to femininity. Its most famous piece, the ""Bar Suit,"" featured a jacket with soft shoulders and a tightly cinched waist that flared out over the hips. This hourglass shape became a symbol of Parisian glamour and has been famously embraced by Hollywood stars.

(Photo by Samir Hussein/WireImage) The decision to wear a significant piece of French couture for a state visit aligns with a long-standing royal tradition of ""fashion diplomacy,"" famously practiced by the late Queen Elizabeth II. By referencing a specific, celebrated moment in French design history, the outfit moved beyond personal style to function as a carefully considered gesture of respect and cultural acknowledgment. The choice of such a structured, high-fashion suit also highlights a notable evolution in the Princess's own personal style. For years, as the Duchess of Cambridge, her accessible wardrobe frequently featured high-street brands like Reiss and L.K. Bennett, effortlessly mixed with designer pieces. However, since becoming the Princess of Wales, her style has transitioned into a more regal and authoritative chapter. This new era is defined by sharply tailored suits, powerful monochromatic ensembles, and a greater reliance on bespoke creations from top-tier design houses, reflecting her elevated position and growing confidence on the world stage."

The Twin Peaks actress and her daughter were spotted making a fashionable entrance at Balenciaga's Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2025/2026 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on July 9 and had a subtle matching moment at the event.

The Mulholland Drive star, 56, had a glowy complexion elevated by rosy blush worn on her cheeks and a matching rosy pink shade on her lips. She slicked her short blonde hair into a side part and flipped the ends for a whimsical touch. Schreiber also opted for a simple outfit for the Balenciaga show. She wore a white empire waist dress with black polka dots that gave a subtle callback to her mother's outfit and paired the dress with simple black heels.

Ahead of her Haute Couture Week appearance, Kai spoke with Interview Magazine in June about her desire to be a model when she was younger. ""I've been practicing my walks in the kitchen for years; my mom can show you all the videos I forced her to film,"" she revealed. The teen, who is transgender, added that ""struggling with my gender identity from a young age most likely had something to do with it. I always wanted to grow up and be a beautiful, glamorous, influential woman, like Marilyn."" Read the original article on People"

I'm still not a fan of the formula, but that color grew on me. I found the right brush and the right combination to make this color work for me (I mix it with a softer warm blush)~~ ✅ 80. ~~A product from a previous project pan - Kilo Milano Create Your Balance Soft Touch Lip&Cheek in Velvet Bliss - 10/10. ~~ (It's not my favorite product, but layering it with other lip products that have the same color range helped me to use it more) ✅ 61. ~~Something bright - NYX Buttermelt Blush in Butta Than Before - 5/5. ~~ (I tried as much as I could to make this shade work by using it in new ways and with different brushes -I didn't count those ""test"" usages - but I'd instead declutter it because it's too pigmented and the shade doesn't work for me) ✅ 55. ~~A spray - Nyx Dewy Finish Setting Spray  - 7/7. ~~ (I like it. The more I use it, the more I realize I don't like matte setting spray, so I'll repurchase it once it's done.) ✅ 32. ~~An eyeshadow - Glamshop Laser - 5/3.

I know it's one of the unpopular releases but I'm so glad I got my hands on it. I can use it for a wash of color on the eyes with the shimmer, for mapping the outline and fill in my brows, add warmth or cool to my face. ~~ ✅ ~~40.

Although all the shimmers don't have the same wow effect, they exceeded my expectations because the swatches didn't do them justice, as far as I'm concerned.

She was in the middle of her morning run, her playlist of upbeat J-pop blasting in her ears, but the world came to a screeching halt. She fumbled for her phone, her heart already starting to pound a familiar, frantic rhythm. It was a text. From him. *Kazuya: Ruka-chan. It's Kazuya. Can we meet? I have something important to talk about. Sarabeth's in Ikebukuro? 2 PM today? * Ruka stared at the screen, her breath caught in her throat. Her heart-rate monitoring app, which she always had running in the background, began to flash a frantic, crimson warning. *95... 105... 120... 140 BPM. * *He... he's asking me out? On a date? No, not a date. He said... 'something important'. * Her mind, a high-speed supercomputer dedicated to all things Kazuya, began processing the data at lightning speed. *Analysis: The tone is serious. The location is a popular, trendy restaurant, not just some cheap ramen shop. The timing is specific. Conclusion: This is it. This is THE confession. * A squeal of pure, unadulterated joy escaped her lips, causing a passing salaryman to give her a wide berth. She didn't care. Nothing else mattered. *It's finally happening! After all this time! He finally realized! He finally sees that I'm the one for him, not Chizuru! He's going to tell me he loves me! He's going to ask me to be his real, official girlfriend! * She pumped her fists in the air, a victory dance on the crowded sidewalk. ""YES! YES! YES!"" But then, a cold sliver of doubt pierced her euphoria. *But what do I wear? What do I say? He said 'important'. That means... I have to look the part. I can't look like a kid. I have to look like... a woman...."

F91233A6BD66151447D65234597CA668,2025-07-10 08:23:14,en,PRINT,"  In the sports world, some wives and girlfriends are more famous than the athletes they are watching. Fashion brands have noticed. As Wimbledon was underway this week, with players adhering to the tournament's strict all-white dress code, fashion watchers turned their attention to the stands, where personalities like Morgan Riddle, the fashion influencer and girlfriend of the American tennis player Taylor Fritz, brought a slightly bolder look to the Grand Slam. On Monday, the tournament's first day, Ms. Riddle wore a blush pink mini dress by Patou, paired with matching strawberry-adorned mules (a nod to the tournament's well-known strawberry and cream dish) and a red Chanel purse. Her blond hair was tied into a half up, half down style with face-framing tendrils. ''If I dressed incredibly inappropriately for Wimbledon, it would be blasted on social media almost instantly and people would probably troll him for it,'' Ms. Riddle said in an interview, referring to Mr. Fritz. Her wardrobe teems with skirts, dresses, blazers and button-down shirts from brands like Thom Browne, Miu Miu and Burberry -- a far cry from her early days on tour with Mr. Fritz, whom she began a relationship with in 2020. Back then, Ms. Riddle, who did not grow up watching tennis, favored jeans, crop tops and sweatshirts. But as she became more enmeshed in the world of the elite sport, her style evolved to meet its expectations. While Wimbledon does not enforce a dress code for spectators, attendees are encouraged to dress ''smart.'' For men, that typically means tailored separates in muted tones; for women, sundresses and low heels. Ms. Riddle takes it a step further. She is polished from every angle, with every sartorial detail deliberate. That's partly because she is a WAG. The term WAG, an acronym used to refer to the wives and girlfriends of sports stars, gained popularity in the British tabloids in the early 2000s, when it was often attached to the glamorous partners of male soccer players. It reached a fever pitch during the 2006 World Cup, when figures like Victoria Beckham were covered almost as closely as the players themselves were. WAGs have taken on a second life in the American sports world, linked to basketball, football and, more recently, Formula 1 and tennis. Vogue called the summer, packed with the N.B.A. playoffs, the U.S. Open, the Stanley Cup and more, ''WAG season,'' spotlighting figures like Jordyn Woods, an influencer and the girlfriend of the Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns as well as Kendall Murray, whose partner is Braiden McGregor of the New York Jets. Publications like Glamour published ''get the look'' edits inspired by Taylor Swift's game day outfits as she watched her boyfriend, Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs, play. Fashion brands have taken note. They're not just dressing the athletes anymore, but their partners, too -- for games, appearances and front rows. Reformation leaned in directly, debuting a collection last month designed for tennis spectators with the tagline: ''Those who can't play, watch.'' As interest in the styling choices of WAGs grows, the question becomes: What even is WAG style? Andrew Pokorny, a television producer who worked on ''WAGs Miami,'' a reality series from E! that aired in the mid-2010s, said that while there was not a singular look, most WAGs followed styling codes. For him, it comes down to one thing: projecting wealth. ''The bank account that they have access to, either through marriage or because they've been given beautiful gifts by their partners, does signal access to an elite club,'' Mr. Pokorny said. Bags from Louis Vuitton, Hermès and Fendi are mainstays, as are shoes from Christian Louboutin. But the illusion of wealth matters, too. According to Mr. Pokorny, many women on the show did not want to be seen in the same outfit twice, and they often worked with fast fashion companies like Fashion Nova to maintain the appearance of an endless wardrobe. In 2016, when the show was filming, that led to some flashy choices. But today's most visible WAGs opt for a more understated look. ''Whether it's ostentatious or subverted, it's always intentional,'' Mr. Pokorny said. '' These WAGs know that people are looking at them. It just depends on what's called for at the time.'' The performance of femininity is also crucial to WAG style, said Judy Liao, a professor at the University of Alberta who researches the sociology of sport and gender. In elite men's sports, women have traditionally been sidelined, seen by many as accessories helping to bolster their partner's masculinity rather than as ardent fans or active participants. What a WAG wears, and how she carries herself, can play a key role in that performance, Dr. Liao said. She sees the resurgence of the WAG as partly a pushback to the growing visibility of women's sports and of bodies that fall outside what she calls the Western ideal of femininity and heteronormativity. ''They're too strong, too Black or too queer,'' she said. '' That's still slightly challenging for the North American mainstream audience to really digest.'' ''WAGs really kind of offer the mainstream media this really good material to say, 'We support gender equality because we're showing women in sport,''' Dr. Liao added. '' But it's not the women who are actually playing the sports.'' Athletes themselves have noticed. In April, Daria Saville, the Australian professional tennis player, took to TikTok to express frustration over women tennis players being passed over for brand partnerships in favor of WAGs. Women who, she said, fit the tennis aesthetic that brands were profiting from. There has been, however, a growing trend of brands tapping women athletes for campaigns and endorsement deals. They include the W.N.B.A. player Angel Reese (Good American), the tennis star Coco Gauff (New Balance) and the rugby player Ilona Maher (Maybelline). But WAGs continue to thrive, with some developing larger social media followings than their partners. Sartorially, though, most roads lead back to the athlete. Dressing often becomes a form of fashion diplomacy, echoing the way political spouses represent their partners abroad...."

E.l.f.'s Hydrating Core Lip Shine in the ""Ecstatic"" shade, which reviewers say captures the some magic as ""Black Honey,"" the $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique that's blowing up on TikTok at a fraction of the price. It doesn't shift colors as magically as the other version, but it's a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lip. I personally will live, breathe, and die by the magic of $25 ""universal"" Black Honey version — it lasts FOREVER and also functions as the perfect blush — but it sells out so often that I am also deeply relieved to know it has a cheap alternative in case of lip emergency! Promising review: ""I absolutely love this product. The dark color is perfectly sheer. It also adds the most beautiful color to your lips. I am a Clinique Black Honey lip fan, and this gives me the same look for a fraction of the cost. I love it and have multiple that I keep in various spots. Not sticky either, which is my biggest gripe about lip glosses. My hair doesn't get stuck in this like some glosses, but I get the shine."" —Hamps5 Get it from Amazon for $6 (also available in four other shades). 2. A set of square stemmed wineglasses inspired by the iconic Crate & Barrel version, except these are durable as heck (good for particularly rowdy wine-and-cheese nights).

Promising review: ""We've had four of these glasses for over six months now and finally just added four more to our collection. These glasses are SO CHIC and are very similar to ones sold at Crate & Barrel but are MUCH more durable. Unlike the C&B glasses, you can cheers without feeling like the glasses will break.

I love them!"" —Katie B Get a set of two from Amazon for $27.99. 3. L'Oréal Paris Makeup True Match Lumi Glotion designed to enhance your skin's natural ✨ glow✨ just like the pricy Drunk Elephant drops — perfect for anyone who wants a lightweight alternative to foundation or just a lil' extra low-effort, ethereal shimmer in their lives. Promising review: ""Love love love this stuff. This is such a stellar product that is so versatile. Can be worn alone to put some glowy life to skin. Add to foundation or layer it. Beautiful. Use it as a base where you put highlighter on top. Mix some with moisturizer. This, in my opinion, is better than so many high-luxury brands that make similar products. And I am pretty sure it can be used by all skin types. It's not an oily feeling at all, and it doesn't dry out the skin either. Just a total package. Can't beat the price either."" —Figgy08 Get it from Amazon for $13.98 (available in five shades). 4.

This prestigious occasion called for a look just as special, and the actor delivered with a killer beauty beat and ensemble—all Chanel, of course. Hannah opted for a bouclé blazer dress with jewel embellishments, modernised with a sheer tulle dress layered underneath, the eclectic look reminiscent of Carrie Bradshaw's '90s style.

n2dszj0,2025-07-10 15:51:26,en,REDDIT,"  I used to run a face up commissions service! I always felt mine were a little meh, too. But I've done the faceups on all my dolls, because it helps me bond lol. This is what I found makes or breaks a faceup: You must work with daylight/natural light. Using a crafter's light won't work because it washes out details and I end up going heavy handed. A combo of daylight and lamp light is fine in my experience. The less detail, the better. You only need enough to suggest what you want others to see. You also don't need to go heavy on blush! One or two layers is just fine. Patience is important between seals. Seal once, wait a half hour, seal a second time, wait a half hour. Then you can jump into work. Seal any time you want to save your progress. Seal between layering. Seal, seal, seal. It's tedious and a little stressful but it's honestly going to give you the best results. You really only need a few layers for a basic faceup: I start with the eyebrows, which are the hardest for me. I use pastel and then carve away excess with a rubber eraser. then the first blush on the lips, the lashes (in watercolor pencil) and any freckles or beauty marks (also in watercolor pencil color pencils.) seal. Then I deepen what I want to deepen and add a layer of blush (saving lashes for later) and seal. From there, I paint in the pink of the eye, and use a dampened watercolor pencil to finish the lashes and refresh any prominent markings I want; I'll use paint sometimes for this but I'm not good with small details with paint. I'll let it dry, then Seal. Add any shimmer I want and lightly seal. Then I gloss. I could be mixing up steps here as it's been some years since I did my last faceup. I've had a poor doll in his box for two years because I haven't gotten around to giving him one! But that's my process."

I might not be a true battle-tested headphone expert like CNET's David Carnoy, but I still love headphones and I'm confident in what I like about them. My most recent pickup, the Marshall Major V on-ear bluetooth headphones, quickly became a pair that I adore. HEADPHONE DEALS OF THE WEEK Deals are selected by the CNET Group commerce team, and may be unrelated to this article. What is Marshall? Marshall is a British audio hardware company that got its start back in the early '60s and became renowned for producing things like amps and speakers for live music performances. More recently, they've made a mark in the consumer audio space, producing home speakers with a distinctly “rock-and-roll” visual aesthetic — think rough-patterned black leather materials, gold trim, and prominent physical buttons. Hey, did you know? CNET Deals texts are free, easy and save you money. They've also brought their signature sound and style to headphones. Recently, I picked up the Major V, Marshall's latest iteration of its on-ear bluetooth model (thats V as in 5, not the letter), and I could hardly love them more. Marshall boasts that these headphones can last up to 100 hours on one charge, an almost ludicrous number that has largely held up as I've use them. The audio quality, while not patch on the heavier hitters in the Bluetooth space, is excellent for its price point, with strong bass and clean high notes. Vocals can sometimes come off a little shabby at first blush, but I find you get used to it real quick. The connectivity performance has also really impressed me. For such a cheap set of headphones, the Major V easily maintains connections to at least two devices at a time and can switch between them almost seamlessly. That's not something I've found to be the case for a lot of the affordable Bluetooth headphones I've tried in the past. It's a strong contender overall in the budget Bluetooth headphones space. Best Prime Day Headphones Deals Prime Day means you don't have to pay full price for a great pair of headphones. Whether you prefer earbuds, headphones or something in between we've got Prime Day headphone deals for you. See Now Why does this deal matter? I was able to scoop up the Marshall Major V for $100, the lowest its price has gone since they debuted last year. For that price, it's basically a steal. For the amount of blissful use I've gotten out of them so far — listening to music, watching movies or getting through my audiobooks — it's been more than worth the price of admission. They usually retail for around $160, making their current price a 38% discount. While I was able to get this deal well in advance of Prime Day, there's no telling how long it'll stick around, so get a move on if you're interested in picking a pair up.

n2gce6m,2025-07-10 23:13:02,en,REDDIT,"  The Transformers (or Autobots, at least) get spared the Great Crusade when the Emperor comes knocking. Big-E isn't a REAL xenophobe. He's just being extremely survivalist in defending humanity from threats, especially Chaos-tainted Xenos. Yes, the Transformers are technically both Xenos and Abominable Intelligence, but Big-E was willing to make concessions where doable. In this scenario, Petra, Regalia, Ferra and Hestia would thrive, being given access to Cybertronian technology and science. I could also see Magna evolving into a Super Magitek Psyker that would make the Necron Crypteks blush with envy. Hathor, Juno and Sanguinia would be Optimus' favorite daughters, taking in to his leadership style and belief system easily. Leona, Petra, Kassandra, Atalanta and Morrigan would be infinitely more stable individuals, but they would almost completely lack their canon cultural marks. In fact, Atalanta would be the empath she was meant to be, and would be on the same level as Hathor, Juno and Sanguinia as far as Prime is concerned. Not gonna lie, a Primus-worshipping Aurelia is funny. Big-E would still hate it, but it's infinitely less worrisome than worshipping him or the Chaos Gods. And to be fair, the Autobots and Cybertronians in general actually seem very mild when it comes to their religion. It's basically ""Oh yeah, Primus is our god, created us and Energon and became our planet. That's... it, really. We don't pray and do masses for him or anything. We just carry on with our lives as decently as possible."" So this version of Aurelia wouldn't even be preaching, because the Cybertronians aren't into that, so she'd be a die-hard for Optimus Prime & the Autobots' ideals of ""Freedom is the Right of All Beings"". Big-E:...Honestly, it's no ideal for my plans, but I approve the energy. It's naive, but I respect it. In fact, this is actually ideal! Malcador, call Mars. Tell the Adeptus Mechanicus are fired... and then actually set the whole planet on fire! I don't think any of the Primarchs would ever side with Megatron and the Decepticons. Decepticons generally regard organics as inferiors, and would see superhumans as threats to Cybertronians. Now, to partner them up! Let's see: Leona El'Jonson - Jetfire. He's essentially akin to the repentant Fallen Dark Angels, and Leona is always the type to use the enemies' technology against them if possible. Fulgrim - Sideswipe, Hot Rod and Arcee. The speed & agility-oriented Transformers, perfect swordsmen. And Arcee being the pink, agile female would fit in well with Fulgrim, especially with her ""Ferocity without compassion is brutality"" mentality. Petra - Wheeljack. The resident scientist working with the best architect & engineer. In Cybertron, Petra would really be allowed to shine, harnessing the power of Transformium to build everything she dreams. Also Hound, the expert Vietnam-esque hardened soldier. Alakhai Khan - Drift and Windblade, the Asian-themed honorable warriors who would mesh perfectly, their idealism contrast nicely with Alakhai's more tempered ruthlessness, and gladly let her ride them into battle. Freya Russ - Thunderhowl, the wolf-themed knight. Regalia Dorn - Bumblebee. Bumblebee isn't exactly a siege defense master, but he has the whole ""protector of my favorite human"" and ""goes berserk when my friends are threatened"" a la Sigsmund. Kassandra Curze - Gridlock. Sanguinia - Ultra Magnus (you know why). Ferra Manus - Ironhide, Bulkhead and Ultra Magnus (again, you know why...). Atalanta - Ratchet. She'd be the most empathetic, thus easily perfect to work with the team doctor (though, of course, their types of medical aid would be very different). Juno Guilliman - Optimus Prime and Elita-1, obviously. Morrigan - ????? Magna the Red - Perceptor. Hathor Lupercal - Crosshairs. Let me explain: Crosshairs in Bayverse, as he's presented, is your typical scoundrel with a heart of gold, and he's a paratrooper who would clearly prefer to strike the enemy commander first and bail while the rest deal with the now leaderless enemy forces. That's basically the Luna Wolves' M.O. Springer & the Wreckers also fit in nicely with her...."

mov_938934D3DC646AFCBCD354E2E246EC91,2025-07-11 06:00:00,en,WEB,"  Healthy, glowing skin straight from your bathroom Last year, we renovated our house. It cost a fortune. So holidays abroad were well and truly put on hold. As a result, I have become a dab hand at faking that gorgeous glow that you really only get after a week or two on holiday. I'm talking unrivalled radiance, sun-kissed cheeks and golden limbs that make every outfit look better. As a beauty editor, I've made it my mission over the past year to find the products that warm up the skin to make me look (and feel) healthier quickly. From tinted SPFs and bronzers, to instant tans and illuminating primers, trust me when I say I have done the legwork to find out which products apply well, look most natural and crucially, make me look radiant and tanned. Because, call me fickle, that's all I really ever want. Here I break down the different steps of my ultimate instant glow routine, which I swear by... My love of self-tan started with tanning drops. As a naturally fair 'English rose', I had always been incredibly nervous of fake tan and the inevitable mishaps that come with it. However, when I was introduced to the Isle Of Paradise Self Tanning Drops, I liked that they gave me the sense of control. It wasn't long before these little drops of sunshine became a firm fixture in my everyday skincare routine. I believe the recommendation is to use them every other day, but a few drops in my moisturiser every morning means that my skin always has a lovely, glowy canvas to apply the rest of my products. The Caudalie Self-Tan Sun Drops have become another favourite. To avoid any obvious tell-tale signs around my hairline, I use a big kabuki brush to buff my moisturiser and tanning drops in, which allows for a more natural finish. Isle of Paradise elf Tanning Face Drops in Medium Self-Tan Sun Drops Once I've applied my moisturiser, laced with tanning drops, I go in with my SPF. I've always loved a product that does more, and a base product with added sun protection is right up my street. Heliocare's 360 Colour Water Gel Bronze SPF50+ gives my skin just the right amount of coverage, evens out any irregular tone in an instant and blends in beautifully. The texture is similar to a lightweight foundation, so once I've applied it with my hands, I often buff it in with a foundation brush in areas that need thinning out slightly, like around my nose. Despite its name, it warms, rather than bronzes, the skin. And it does so beautifully. The viral Beauty of Joseon Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen is another knockout product, with 12 shades to choose from. 360 Colour Water Gel Bronze SPF50+ Beauty of Joseon Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen SPF30 PA+++ Every time I wear the L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion, I receive a compliment. Not only does it add a touch of colour to the skin, but it's the pearlescent sheen that it leaves behind that really makes a difference. You can use it as a primer, as I like to, tapped in as a highlighter or mixed in with your foundation for a more subtle finish. Vieve's iconic Skin Nova Instant Radiance Primer works similarly, but without the bronzing effect. Both transform tired skin in an instant. L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion Skin Nova Instant Radiance Primer Bronzer is arguably the must-have product in any glowing skin routine. Everybody has a preferred texture; mine will always be cream. I have dry and often dehydrated skin, so I prefer cream and liquid textures that won't settle in dry patches or fine lines. I couldn't write about tanned-looking skin without including Chanel's mega (in size and results) Les Beiges Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream. Not only does it give a natural-looking effect (which is down to its velvet matte finish), but it lasts and lasts, so is worth the investment. Earlier this year, the shade range grew, meaning it finally works for all skin tones. I can't ignore the fact that this giant bronzer does not travel well, so when I'm away from home or on the go, I use the Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Truffle. This twist-up cream bronzer has a slightly dewier finish compared to Chanel's, but the pigment payoff is great, and stick formulations make for easy application. Les Beiges Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Truffle In the middle of last summer, blonzing (a technique that blends bronzer and blusher together) became a viral make-up trend...."

mov_02E4E02EB020A18FD523190A07F90673,2025-07-12 09:00:00,en,WEB,"  Earlier this summer, I chatted with Fran Drescher via Zoom. Despite relatively choppy reception (from my end; I'd been in a remote area of Sicily), I was transfixed by the 67-year-old's luminous complexion. Luckily for me, Drescher is hardly a gate-keeper when it comes to beauty products. The actor, an ambassador for Oprah-approved beauty brand Laura Geller, divulged the exact products behind her ethereal glow. Most salient among them: picks from its popular primer collection, which consists of six anti-aging, foundation-prolonging formulas. Despite their distinguishing properties, all six share a penchant for blurring imperfections, flattering all skin tones, and enhancing skin in seconds. While the brand is made for mature skin, the primers are, in fact, suitable for all ages and skin types—including ultra-sensitive, reactive complexions (as evidenced by approval from the National Psoriasis Foundation). Drescher, who relies on Laura Geller primers for red carpet appearances and daily life, is particularly fond of its glow-boosting renditions, which she dons regularly. Naturally, I snagged all six primers for myself post-Zoom. While I can't (necessarily) claim to have acquired Drescher-level radiance in the month or so since I've incorporated them into my routine, I have fallen for the Spackle Primers—particualrly a trio of tinted, illuminating versions. Now's an ideal time to try the anti-aging primers yourself: Laura Geller is on a major sitewide sale, offering an additional 45 percent off already-discounted products with the code at checkout. Snap up all six of the anti-aging primers—or beeline for the three glow-boosting spinoffs Drescher and I swear by, below. Best Laura Geller Spackle Primers on Sale Laura Geller Spackle Skin Perfecting Primer, Bronze Laura Geller As an exceptionally pasty, UV-ray-avoiding person—who, simultaneously, prefers to look like I live near the equator—I turn to this bronzing, summer-ready rendition of Laura Geller's primer frequently. In addition to a lightweight, believable bronze glow, the formula is packed with plumping hyaluronic acid and softening squalane. Drescher shares my fondness; so much so, in fact, she extends its glow-boosting goodness to the skin on her body. Laura Geller Spackle Skin Perfecting Primer, Champagne Glow Laura Mercier The Champagne Glow primer creates an effervescent skin finish reminiscent of its namesake. It imparts a post-vacacy vibe—albiet more subtly than its aforementioned bronze glow cousin. Instead of tan, expect a “soft-focus” finish, in the brand's words, which bounces light from the skin to create the illusion of hyper-radiance. I've worn this flattering formula alone for a dewy, bare-faced look, under foundation for a lit-from-within-glow, and even on the high points of my face for a subtle highlight. Spackle Skin Perfecting Primer, Ethereal Rose Glow Laura Mercier As we age, blood flow to the face can diminish—and sap the rosiness of youth. (It's for this reason anti-aging creams often deposit a subtle pink tinge; Jane Fonda's go-to rosy glow moisturizer, for example.) While Fonda—and my 72-year-old mom, also a fan of pinkish products—have a few years on me yet, my 30-something skin is increasingly sallow. On days I crave an instant glow-up, I turn to this formula. Within seconds, it enlivens my corpselike complexion, and—as with each of the six primer options—prevents midday makeup meltdown in the balmy months of summer and beyond. For luminous skin and longer-wearing makeup, shop the skin-enhancing Laura Geller Spackle Primers before they return to full price. Consider additional fan-favorites, below—and remember to use the code at checkout to score the additional 45 percent off of your order.

mov_0D47B6BBEB0F54120808CCF8D5DE9A25,2025-07-12 20:00:52,en,WEB,"  The mysterious naked lady of the Cootamundra hills narrowly escaped being shot by a hunter. Photo: Created using Ai and Photoshop. In early 1932, rumours of a naked lady roaming the hills between Junee and Stockinbingle titillated the nation and men across the Riverina scrambled to form search parties. The story began in February with a widely syndicated story from a snarky Cootamundra correspondent under the headline “Godiva” in reference to the English noble woman who famously rode naked through the streets of Coventry. Enjoying his medieval literary theme the reporter described the “elusive mystery of pink skin and dishevelled hair” glimpsed by moonlight along with the “pattering of bare feet and the flash of quickly moving limbs” as she dashed off towards Stockinbingal. READ ALSO: Two Riverina arts powerhouses set to transform storytelling with major funding boost As word began to spread, the “chivalrous” men of the region dragged themselves from their armchairs and “the search was on”. At one stage the correspondent claims that more than 50 men were enthusiastically scouring the scrub. “A party ventured into the hills in quest of the strange demented lady who darted here and there – like a will-o'-the-wisp – defying convention and bringing a blush of embarrassment to wanderers,” he said. After three days, the searchers could find no sign of her, and struggling in the scorching summer heat, declared the story a hoax and headed back home for some shade. But while the correspondent was happy to laugh it off as a joke aimed at embarrassing the “gallant” locals, there were more sightings the following month. “What is believed to be a demented woman wandering in the bush almost fell to a local man who was shooting at North Junee yesterday,” reported the Telegraph on 12 March. “Seeing what he thought was an animal of some kind, he was about to shoot, when he found that his mark was a woman, hidden in the bushes.” READ ALSO: Riverina Rewind: Wagga's cheekiest bank robber would rather be at the pub The elusive streaker, now wearing a black beret, was also spotted by a woman outside the town and the news report recalled the numerous sightings in the Cootamundra hills in previous weeks. The police resumed their search and days after her encounter with a hunter, the mystery woman was finally captured on the Junee golf links. “When arrested she was wearing badly torn clothes, and had obviously spent a long time in the open, eating whatever she was able to find,” recounted Melbourne's Sun News . Despite her tattered black dress, the woman was calm and well spoken with a “prepossessing appearance” and gave her name as May Smith. Charged at Junee court with “having no visible means of support”, she was refused bail and was remanded for eight days while police tried to piece things together. In the meantime, Ms 'Smith' settled into her cell where she declined to give any further information and refused to eat. “You don't need to eat to live. You can get along all right without food,” she told her captors. Police doubted the name she gave was authentic and despite locating a campsite and a suitcase filled with good quality clothes, they were unable to discover any more details about her. Now that Ms Smith was fully dressed, and apparently “demented”, the newspapers lost interest and the final report describes the unfortunate woman being handed over for medical examination."

Kennst du das? Du stehst mit einem Arm voll Wäsche vor dem Korb, balancierst noch einen Latte Macchiato in der anderen Hand und denkst: „Ach komm, einfach alles rein, Hauptsache weg damit. “ Ja, hab ich früher auch gemacht. Bis ich irgendwann kapiert hab: Mein Wäschekorb ist kein Chaos-Bunker. Vor allem nicht für Socken und Unterwäsche. Warum das ein echtes No-Go ist – und welche Lifehacks dir das Leben (und die Wäsche) leichter machen, verrate ich dir jetzt. Lesetipp: Warum das Wäschekorb-Chaos mehr nervt als du denkst Klar, niemand sieht deinen Wäschekorb – außer vielleicht dein:e Mitbewohner:in, dein:e Partner:in oder du selbst im Halbschlaf. Aber was wie ein kleines Orga-Chaos aussieht, rächt sich spätestens in der Waschmaschine. Socken wickeln sich um Spitzen-BHs, Unterhosen verheddern sich mit Sport-BHs, feine Materialien leiden, Farben übertragen sich – und plötzlich ist das zarte Spitzenslipchen grau statt blush pink. Dein Fashion- und Beauty-Newsletter Entdecke exklusive Fashion-Trends, Influencer-Tipps und die besten Clean-Beauty-Hacks – alles in deinem Postfach! Ich habe früher alles zusammen in die Maschine gestopft. Und jedes Mal aufs Neue die Socken-Pärchen verflucht, die einfach nicht wieder zueinander finden wollten. Bis ich irgendwann einen simplen Lifehack entdeckt habe (danke, TikTok!) : getrennte Wäschesäckchen für Socken und Unterwäsche. Seitdem – Halleluja! – ist nicht nur mein Wäschekorb organisierter, sondern auch meine Laune. Lifehack für dein Wäscheleben: Sortieren statt suchen Wer morgens schon mal auf einem Bein durch die Wohnung gehüpft ist, weil wieder nur eine Socke auffindbar war, weiß: Sockenchaos ist real. Und vermeidbar. Mein Tipp: Lege dir zwei Wäschekörbe zu – einen für Socken und Unterwäsche, einen für den Rest. Alternativ kannst du Wäschebeutel direkt im Korb einsetzen, die deine Lieblingsstücke voneinander trennen. Ein weiterer Lifehack, den ich nie wieder missen möchte: Mesh-Wäschesäckchen mit Reißverschluss. Gibt's günstig bei DM, IKEA oder Amazon. Einfach alle Slips, BHs oder Socken direkt darin sammeln – und genauso in die Maschine stecken. Spart nicht nur Zeit beim Sortieren, sondern schützt empfindliche Teile auch vor der brutalen Schleuderattacke. Hygiene, Baby! Warum Trennung auch aus gesundheitlicher Sicht Sinn macht So banal es klingt: Deine Unterwäsche ist das Kleidungsstück, das deinem Körper am nächsten kommt – und das teilweise stundenlang. Gerade wenn du viel schwitzt, Sport machst oder sensibel auf Waschmittel reagierst, willst du sicher sein, dass da keine Keime oder Fusselreste von Sportsocken oder alten Kuschelsocken mitreisen. Durch das Sortieren und separate Waschen reduzierst du nicht nur Reibung und Abnutzung, sondern auch das Risiko, dass sich Bakterien oder Pilze von einem Kleidungsstück aufs andere übertragen. Besonders wichtig ist das, wenn du empfindliche Haut hast oder zu Infektionen neigst. Und sind wir ehrlich: Niemand will Sockenflusen im Slip. Wirklich niemand. Du magst unsere Themen? Dann lies uns auch bei Google News. Ordnung im Wäschekorb, Ruhe im Kopf Es klingt fast zu einfach, aber: Ein strukturierter Wäschekorb hat mein inneres Chaos ein kleines Stück geordnet. Klingt dramatisch, ist aber so. Wenn ich abends den Korb öffne und sehe, dass alles fein säuberlich getrennt ist, fühlt sich das ein bisschen wie ein Mini-Sieg im Alltag an. Ich weiß, wir alle haben wichtigere Probleme. Aber diese kleinen Lifehacks machen eben doch den Unterschied – besonders an stressigen Tagen...."

Since then, we welcomed a fur baby, April, our Rottweiler/Pitbull mix, who's almost 2 now. We also lost our big girl, Storm, this past March, and it's still so hard. Doing my nails is still one of my favorite forms of self-care, and I don't think that'll ever change! Anyway, happy Sunday!!!
