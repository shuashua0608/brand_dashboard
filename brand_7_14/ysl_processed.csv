What I have in mind is LV Neverfull (any LV really, ick), YSL Icare, Moschino bags, larger Chanel bags, Gucci marmont (but this one - if styled well, I can accept). Any large logo tbh. Unpopular opinion but Birkin doesn't also sound like a beautiful bag to me, but here at least you have the story and the culture around it. I can't afford it anyway, lol. I find much more joy in looking for bags with super small logos, but with interesting design or from ethical source. If manufactured locally for a good salary, then it's perfect. My price range is mostly affordable luxury, not any high level brand, but I always try to look for something special."

On June 10, Saldana and her sons arrived hand-in-hand at the LA premiere of Disney Pixar's Elio, which is a movie that follows a boy who's a self-described space fanatic, who is accidentally mistaken for the leader of Earth while meeting aliens. Saldana plays Olga Solis, Elio's aunt, and it's set to be released on June 20, 2025. But back to the premiere: Saldana arrived in style, and so did her sons! You can see the photos below: Zoe Saldaña (C), family at the ""Elio"" Premiere held at El Capitan Theatre on June 10, 2025 in Los Angeles, California.

As you can see in the photos, we see the Oscar-winning actress in an orange and mustard ensemble from YSL, styled by her go-to stylist, Petra Flannery. And as for her sons, they all twinned in blue jeans and navy suit jackets! How dapper! Saldana even posted about getting ready for the premiere, and her family's time there. She posted it all to her Instagram with the caption reading, “#Elio premier was out of this world! Can't wait for you all to see it! “ Zoe Saldana in the press room for 77th Annual Directors Guild of America DGAs Awards - Press Room, Beverly Hilton Hotel, Beverly Hills, CA, February 08, 2025. Photo By: Elizabeth Goodenough/Everett Collection For those who don't know, Saldaña and her husband, Marco Perego, share three sons together: twins Cy and Bowie, born in Nov 2014, and Zen, born in Dec 2016. In an interview with SheKnows for the 2023 Holiday Issue, Saldaña talked about the quality time she spends with her. “When it comes to rituals and interactions that we can do together, I will do it,” she said. “It gives us the opportunity to play these games with them … you know, interact, as opposed to just granting them this time and monitoring it. We're right in the trenches with them playing the game, and it's become a family event for us.” Before you go, check out these celebrity mothers who love being boy moms."

The ocean jewel palette is stunning but it'll have to be at a later date if I get to pick it up. Those Charolette blushes so look nice too! There's a purple YSL highlighter I might have to break my no buy for 😆. I'm weak what can I say but I haven't pulled the trigger yet. I'm definitely bummed about the tariffs for cosmic brushes. I finally got the cooltrals palette a couple months back and some of their eye brushes too. I want those new sigma brushes but they are pricey for my budget at $103 for the (6) of them. They have her palette paired with it for $115 so it'd be silly not to just get them both cause alone the palettes $40 so with grabbing fit the extra $12. I'm just gonna pay off an affirm order from them though so I really shouldn't start another.

I bought this cheap little perfume at a miniso years ago, and its one of my favorites. I'm allergic to a lot of fragrances and just generally sensitive to any strong smelling stuff (rip my ysl mon paris sample that made my throat start closing up), but this one is light enough for me to tolerate yet strong enough to last for a while. it's so tiny and im scared to use it too quickly because I've never found it again, in miniso or online. if anyone has any fragrances with similar notes (I'm not a huge fragrance person so I'm not great at identifying notes)， please share any recommendations!!"

6月13日消息，抖音电商宣布，为了降低商家的入驻及运营成本，正式发布新版保证金规则。 1、全面开放新商家“0元入驻”：新商家无需缴纳保证金，先入驻平台进行有限制的试运营。 当商家的支付订单量大于200或订单总额超过1万元的情况下，可通过货款逐步充值保证金至平台标准即可。 2、大幅降低商家的基础保证金：以商家上个月支付GMV5万元、10万元为分界线，基础保证金降为500元、2000元、5000元三档。 相比调整前，降幅普遍达75%。 这次新规开始执行后，商家保证金账户超额的部分可以提现，每周可提取一次。 三、投融资及财报

Los dos directivos fueron clave en las últimas medidas adoptadas por la marca del Rombo en la Argentina. Pedrucci aprobó la inversión de 350 millones de dólares para producir la pick-up derivada de la Renault Niágara Concept en la Fábrica Santa Isabel (ver nota), mientras que De Meo se puso al frente de las negociaciones para que el piloto argentino Franco Colapinto desembarcara en la escudería Alpine de Fórmula 1 (leer más). La abrupta salida de los dos ejecutivos deja abierta la incógnita acerca de lo que ocurrirá en el futuro con la estrategia de la empresa. Desde Renault Argentina no se hicieron comentarios oficiales acerca de la renuncia de estos directivos. Al momento de publicarse esta nota, la filial local ni siquiera se había hecho eco de los comunicados que se difundieron sobre estas dos renuncias en Francia, Brasil, España y otras sedes del Rombo. Por el momento, Renault Group no informó quiénes reemplazarán a estos dos ejecutivos. En el marco de una restructuración gerencial de la empresa, es probable que el cargo que ocupaba Pedrucci desaparezca por completo. Con respecto a De Meo, su salida fue sorpresiva. La casa matriz se limitó a informar anoche que el Directorio de Renault Group ""inició el proceso para designar a un nuevo CEO, basados en un plan de sucesión ya definido"". Si bien Pedrucci no brindó pistas en su mensaje de despedida acerca de su futuro profesional (ver completo abajo), el caso de Luca De Meo fue diferente: el ex CEO de Renault Group protagonizó semanas atrás un debate público (recordemos que el Estado de Francia tiene participación accionaria en la empresa) donde tuvo que justificar su salario anual de 5.5 millones de euros. También se rechazó su propuesta de aumentar los sueldos a toda la plantilla de la empresa. Pero De Meo ya encontró un nuevo trabajo. Al mismo tiempo que ayer se confirmaba su salida de Renault Group, el Grupo Kering anunció la incorporación de De Meo a la cúpula de la empresa: se trata de la firma de bienes de consumo de lujo, que tiene en su portafolio a marcas de prestigio como Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga y Puma, entre muchas otras. Los dos ex ejecutivos de Renault fueron líderes personalistas. El brasileño Pedrucci no dudaba a la hora de desautorizar en público a sus subordinados: quería tener el control y recibir el mérito absoluto por las principales decisiones y anuncios de la empresa. El italiano De Meo, por su parte, trabajó para convertirse en una figura pública con alto perfil de exposición en los medios. En sus últimas semanas al frente de Renault, De Meo estrenó su propia película documental donde contó la historia de su estrategia comercial ""Renaulution"" (leer más). Además, había lanzado a la venta su propio libro autobiogfráfico, donde relata su relación personal con el mundo de los autos: ""Diccionario sentimental del automóvil"" (leer más). La crisis gerencial de Renault recién empieza. El directorio del Rombo tiene ahora el desafío de ver cómo cubre los puestos vacantes o si aprovecha estas salidas para encarar una restructuración más profunda de la compañía. Hay más información en los comunicados de despedida de los dos ejecutivos, acá abajo. C.C. ""Tras 5 años al frente del Grupo Renault, Luca de Meo ha anunciado su decisión de dimitir y emprender nuevos retos fuera del sector de la automoción. El Consejo de Administración, convocado por su presidente, Jean-Dominique Senard, expresó su agradecimiento a Luca de Meo por la transformación del Grupo Renault y acordó que su salida se hará efectiva a partir del 15 de julio de 2025. Luca de Meo continuará desempeñando sus funciones hasta esa fecha. El Consejo de Administración ha iniciado el proceso de nombramiento de un nuevo Director General, basándose en el plan de sucesión ya definido. El Consejo de Administración ha expresado su confianza en la calidad y la experiencia del equipo directivo para continuar y acelerar la estrategia de transformación del Grupo Renault en esta nueva etapa"". ""Hoy cierro un ciclo. Un ciclo largo, intenso y feliz. Me incorporé a Renault en 1997 como becario. La empresa llegó a Brasil y yo iniciaba mi vida profesional. Crecimos juntos. Aprendí. Cometí errores. Me atreví. Siempre creí en lo que podíamos construir. Durante casi tres décadas, viví en diferentes países, dirigí equipos, enfrenté crisis y celebré muchas victorias. Trabajé en ventas, posventa, marketing, producto y cadena de suministro. Me enorgullecía ser presidente de Renault en mi querida e inolvidable Colombia. Veinte años después de empezar como becario, asumí el cargo de primer presidente brasileño de Renault do Brasil. Dos años después, me convertí en el primer presidente latinoamericano de Renault Latinoamérica. Hemos vivido años intensos. Hemos superado grandes retos. Hemos alcanzado logros tangibles. Recientemente, aprobamos el plan de inversiones para los próximos años. Hemos comenzado la fase de renovación. Hoy, me voy de Renault orgulloso de lo que hemos logrado juntos...."

With a seemingly endless array of different scents and brands to choose from, there's always something for everyone. However, despite the abundance of choice, lots of us will have one bottle we always return to. For many, it's the Elizabeth Arden Provocative Woman Eau de Parfum, with some saying it has been a staple for ""20 years."" The luxury brand's perfumes are often a bestseller, particularly on Amazon, which is why it is good news that a 100ml bottle has been reduced from £55 to just £16.95, offering a hefty 69 percent discount off the RRP.

Meanwhile, for some perfume fans, another fragrance to stand the test of time is the £69 YSL Black Opium Eau de Parfum (30ml) that offers a floral gourmand scent, with a shot of dark coffee for a bit of a unique twist. Provocative Women first launched in 2004(Image: Elizabeth Arden) As for Elizabeth Arden's perfume, it has currently amassed a 4.4 rating based on hundreds of Amazon reviews, with shoppers branding it as ""an old favourite"" that they have worn time and time again since it launched.

It's a very distinctive scent, not flowery or sweet, its name rings true to the scent!"" A second loyal purchaser said: ""I was devastated when they stopped production of this fragrance.

We hope you've been saving up your pennies over the last few months, as Amazon Prime Day is arriving soon to help you spend them. Amazon absolutely loves summer sales, slashing prices on essentially every product available on the site every year, and we can't wait to take advantage of and upgrade our fragrance collection. Amazon is a pretty superb location to hunt for new scents generally, with free next-day delivery on any purchases and the option to peruse the biggest and most popular brands available. And Prime Day simply drops the price of those fragrances, by up to 60 per cent in some examples we've seen from previous years. So if you've used up all your Joop Jump! and your Boss Bottled is looking perilously low, praise the gods of online shopping, you've got a whopping event coming your way. What's in British GQ's guide to the best Amazon Prime Day fragrance deals?AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevronAmazon Prime Day 2025: all the info and best dealsHow we pick the best Amazon Prime Day deals Picking out a fragrance that's perfect for you can not only be a tough task, but also prohibitively expensive. Options from Hermès or YSL can easily cost upwards of £200 and only be available from specific retailers. However, we're big supporters of owning a broad variety of fragrances for any occasion. Need something professional for the office? Perhaps you've got a summer wedding coming up and need a fresh, citrusy option to please a crowd. Therefore, it's always good to take advantage of a sale to buy some low-to-mid-price options to fill out your roster. For us, we love all top-end scents, so the below picks are brands and aromas our shopping editors have personally used or at least sniffed and adored. Eros Named after the Greek god of love, romance and all things sexy, Versace's Eros is sensual, light and ready to help you mingle. In Motion We don't think John Barnes had anything to do with the creation of this fragrance, but it suits us perfectly that it's keeping the world in motion. A strong orange scent is present up front, with wood and amber hidden underneath. BOSS Bottled BOSS BOSS Bottled BOSS Bottled is a staple purchase in the Prime Day sales, as it typically is knocked way down by almost 50 per cent. You've got sandalwood, pineapple and iced violet leaves to woo anyone you happen to walk past. CK Be Calvin Klein Calvin Klein loves a boxer and a fragrance, so treat yourself to a new pair of briefs and a summer scent in the same sale. CK Be has juniper berry and white spice for a curious, sensual attraction."

tw_sl_176e6de4d90701b335f9ffa36f5f65ca,2025-06-17 09:46:29,en,WEB,"  Geri Horner has worn a near-identical outfit to a movie premiere as Brad Pitt's girlfriend Ines de Ramon. On Monday night, the world premiere of the film F1 was held at Times Square in New York. The upcoming blockbuster stars Brad, 61, as Sonny Hayes, a former Formula One driver who was forced to retire decades ago following a horrible crash. However, he returns to the racetrack after a team owner asks him to come out of retirement to mentor rookie prodigy Joshua 'Noah' Pearce (Damson Idris) for the Apex Grand Prix team. Last night the stars of the movie, which also include Kerry Condon, Tobias Menzies and Javier Bardem, walked the red carpet. But Geri and Ines, 32, faced an awkward moment when they both turned up in white halter neck outfits. The former Spice Girl, 52, whose husband Christian Horner is the chief executive officer and team principal of Red Bull Racing, wore a jacquard dress which she paired with a pair of white YSL Tribute platform heels. Meanwhile jewellery designer Ines, who was previously married to Vampire Diaries actor Paul Wesley and started dating Brad in 2022, also wore an all-white outfit. Ines hit the carpet in a white halter neck top, which she paired with a pair of sheer pants adorned with feathers. She paired her outfit with a brown belt and small white Chanel bag. During her Spice Girls days, Geri became known for her bold, showstopping looks, including the now-famous Union Jack dress. However, in recent years she's rarely been seen in anything but all-white outfits. She previously told The Sun that wearing white all the time simplified her busy life and gives her a 'fresh start'. To view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video 'Everything becomes really simple. It's like wearing a school uniform as an adult,' she said. 'It matches with everything, and I literally don't have to think in the mornings. It kind of looks like you've made an effort when you haven't.' The pair didn't seem to let the double up affect them too much though, leaving the focus to the movie, which hits cinemas on June 25. F1 also features all ten Formula One teams and their drivers from the 2023 season. They include Max Verstappen, Charles Leclerc, Lewis Hamilton, Lando Norris and Daniel Ricciardo. Director Joseph Kosinski previously revealed that Lewis gave Brad his first driving lesson because, as he put it, 'if Brad can't drive, this whole film wasn't going to work'. However, Kosinski told press including Metro during a special Q&A for the trailer launch: 'He's a very talented, naturally gifted driver, which for Lewis, after that first meeting, gave him a lot of confidence that we might have a shot at pulling this off.' He added: 'You have to be fearless, and when you see Brad driving, that's not acting. He's really concentrating on keeping that car on the track and out of the wall during all those scenes – so that's something that you just can't fake.' The director also said the film was 'universal' and wasn't just for F1 fans. 'It's about friendship, teamwork, sacrifice, redemption. It just happens to be set in this incredibly exciting world of Formula One,' he continued. 'You don't need to know anything going in. We'll teach you everything you need to enjoy this story.'

mov_F7947093A8302C4E8BE18E3F93324F2C,2025-06-17 13:01:03,en,WEB,"  Little did you know, there are solid substitutes for brands like YSL, Clinique, and Apple. 1. A pair of waterproof wireless earbuds that look just like AirPods Pro — *but* these have an LED display to show you the battery percentage on the case. These don't have noise cancellation like the Pros do, but if that's not something you're looking for, this swap will help you save a LOT of pretty pennies. The earbuds last up to 6 hours on a single charge and are sweatproof, meaning they can transition seamlessly from your phone call to a running session around your neighborhood. Promising review: ""I use these every day at work! Love these — easy to learn and to use. Best thing about them? Well, everything, lol. Good sound, they hold a charge for long periods, and I don't have to worry about them losing power. I can answer my phone easily and then go back to music without a problem. Definitely a great buy and worth the money! Love this color, too!"" —Erin Get it from Amazon for $25.98 (available in eight colors). 2. And a pair of wireless over-the-ear headphones with the same sleek, shiny shell design of AirPods Max. These have pretty decent noise cancellation (according to reviewers) and a built-in mic to answer calls, and they feel super comfy on your ears with their extra padding. For only 20 bucks, they're a much safer (and wallet-friendly) purchase if you're unsure about Apple's headphones — they are over $500, after all... It has 10 hours of battery life, too! iJoy is a small business that specializes in headphones and tech accessories. Check out why BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord loves these: I own a pair of these, and because I'm vain as heck and need to own all things pink, but I was decently surprised by how well they muffle noise! I feel like these are ideal for people who still want to hear some of the world around them (read: parents, people working in open offices), but still want to listen to their tunes comfortably. The charge on these goes for at least four hours (I haven't tried it beyond that yet), and the Bluetooth connects to my devices super easily. Excellent pair of headphones for the price point. Promising review: ""To be honest, I wanted the Apple ones because I felt it would be better for me, but my financial situation wouldn't allow me to get them. I made the decision to get these. These are very cute and comfortable. I have really enjoyed them...The sound is good and the calls are clear. Great for the price. I haven't been disappointed. So if you're in a bind and need headphones, you will definitely love these. They are not 100% soundproof, but they do have some noise reduction, and your caller can still hear you clearly outside."" —Carolinee J. Cowart Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in five colors). 3. A cubic zirconia ring that looks so much like a Cartier Love Ring, people will think you dropped BANDS for it. People will undoubtedly compliment your bling, so in the words of Mel Robbins — let them. ☺ Promising review: ""The perfect non-name-brand ring you can find honestly. I wasn't looking for a Cartier knock-off when I found this ring, but I have had people ask me if it's the real deal. I honestly love this ring though, the sizing was accurate, it is weighted well, none of the 'diamonds' have fallen off, and it hasn't tarnished! I've worn it daily for almost a year now and it has held up well. It has some very small scratches on it, but that's typical of most rings. For the price, I am super happy with this ring, and I honestly can't believe how well it has handled everything I've put it through."" —Eva Richterkessing Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in sizes 5–12, three finishes, and two styles). 4. The Hanes Ultimate crew socks because who wants to drop bank on good quality socks?! No thanks...."

1ldssxd,2025-06-17 17:10:21,en,REDDIT,"  Occasionally i will do some research into what other mobile detailing businesses are near and also how many new businesses have popped up and i can honestly say this year there has been over 15 new mobile detailers to pop up in my area. Is business slow this year with some weeks being chaotic and some weeks just dead silent? Yes. Not all of the slow down is attributed to a falling economy but also from oversaturation and with businesses that are charging almost nothing for their services. One business for example, check out the prices. There may be pros in cons to going with the cheapest price but the cons greatly outway the pros and the few questions that linger would be what type brand or quality of products are they using and also with prices this low, how are they insured? My prices and the brand of products i use including the equipment tell a story that i have full coverage insurance, i am using products like Shine supply, KC, Dupray Tosca etc. My point here is that i noticed with my prices staying high and not giving any discounts, i had an increase in new and returning clients. When you put your prices to almost year 2000's prices, yes you will get those business but it will be worse than groupon. When you have prices on the higher side but inline with the current market then people will see you as a brand. Compare this to Balenciaga brand or Ysl. They are expensive brands and if they were to be affordable to everyone and only cost $140. No one would want those brands anymore and then it would attract the wrong clients."

mov_B263D2545F5CD1855986A9A718B2D7EB,2025-06-17 19:53:20,en,WEB,"  When it comes to designing a forever home, it's all about investing in furniture that speaks to you. While it's inevitable that your home will change over the years, one of the best ways to ensure that your choices endure is by thoughtfully and meticulously styling your pieces. Avid vintage collector and interior designer Nate Berkus proved this theory when he took to Instagram to show off one of the most beloved pieces in his home – a vintage orange-tinged marble coffee table. The coffee table itself is a beautiful, timeless piece, but I was also taking notes on his coffee table styling ideas. It's a surface in my home I rearrange almost weekly, and I learned some key lessons watching Nate talk through his space. 1. Pick a coffee table that's going to add an interesting base Nate's beautiful marble coffee table has a backstory. He explains in the video, 'Funny story about this coffee table. It's made from Rosso marble. It was designed by Gae Aulenti in the 1960s and 70s, and Knoll produced it.' 'Jeremiah and I saw this table online from an antiques dealer in Palm Springs when we lived in Los Angeles. We called the shop and we said, ""Do you still have this table? "" and they said, ""Yes, we have a truck leaving for LA in an hour, so if you want this table, it can be in your living room in three hours."" It's a gem of a piece, a real statement. Although Nate explains that even for him, the terracotta shade was unfamiliar, the risky choice pays off; 'It was definitely a risk for us years ago when we bought this color, as we thought it was really adventurous. What I love about it is it's definitely post-midcentury, sixties, seventies vibe, but it's super strong, super stable, very architectural, and very sculptural.' It's the color and textures peeking through the coffee table decor that make it the perfect base for building vignettes with a ton of depth and interest. It's not so bold you can't add whatever you want on top, pattern and texture-wise, but it's also not just a bland background for decor. If you want to get your hands on the exact same piece as Nate's and have a toppy budget, you can shop the 'Jumbo' marble table on 1st Dibs. Or, I found some similar styles that have that same wonderful texture and warm color. Rosso Marble Accent Table (20"") This square marble side table is the perfect addition to your living room. Slot in beside your sofa or at the heart of the room for an elegant flourish that feels timeless and sophisticated. Perfect for laying your coffee table book collection. Moraga Coffee Table This deep red coffee table has sculptural legs and a smooth top. It's an elegant, luxurious style that would pair well with a really texture-heavy living room – think tufted rugs, boucle sofa, and lots of wood. Pierce & Ward Marble Coffee Table (42"") This mid-century style coffee table is unique in shape. With its angular legs and sleek marble top, it's a classic vintage style that will bring a sense of eclecticism and grandeur to your living room. 2. Bring in beautiful pieces that also have a practical purpose All good coffee table setups are about balance. These are quite practical surfaces that can't totally give way to pure aesthetics, and Nate's coffee table gets that balance spot on using beautiful pieces that could also cater to something practical. Case in point, the ornate glass dishes that top the piles of books, perfect for coralling clutter and keeping a coffee table organized when you need. I have added a couple to my coffee table set up, and they are ideal temporary homes for keys, spare change, lipsticks – things that would normally be thrown on the table now sit neatly in dishes that double as decor. Of course, Nate also included a tray within his coffee table decor. A must to give your styling some structure and zone the space. It's also an opportunity to add in some different textures – the softer rattan contrasts with the clean lines of the stacks of books, and the fluid shapes of the vintage candlesticks. Glass Scallop Bowl This vintage-style glass bowl is the perfect coffee table accessory. It's delicate and oh-so elegant and would contrast wonderfully with heavy coffee table books. Modern Rustic Verdigris Metal Candle Holders Nate has a pair of vintage candle holders on his coffee table, much like this rustic pair from Etsy. They give the arrangement patina and character that perfectly contrasts with the slick marble. LOEWE Oregano small scented candle This oregano-scented candle will entice you to sit and relax as soon as you enter your living room. It's a classic coffee table accessory that brings sophistication and atmosphere. 3. Create zones with in your coffee table decor While Nate's layout of his coffee table decor seems effortless, there's definitely some method behind the arrangement. The pieces are stacked in individual areas that prevent the surface from feeling overwhelmed or cluttered and allow for the beautiful marble to still have plenty of stage time. Each piece of decor has been given space to breathe...."

016278917CB2F38D1E666B4EE2D01596,2025-06-18 06:23:51,en,PRINT,"  In March, Asian Paints had a swish opening for Nilaya Anthology, its gallery-style decor store in the heart of space-starved Mumbai. Hailed as the most ambitious interior design showroom in the country, and spread across 100,000 sq.ft., it is the size of almost two football fields. At the launch, guests sipped Veuve Clicquot Champagne while admiring wares from Milan's haute design gallery Nilufer, Vikram Goyal's museum-worthy brass creations, and whole rooms devoted to bespoke Italian-designed kitchens, bathrooms, home spas and furniture from Europe and the Far East. In a city where fancy store openings happen on an almost weekly basis, it was, by far, the grandest, buzziest opening party. “This is easily India's most luxury-focused retail concept,” says Greg Foster, artistic director at Jaipur Rugs and former editor of Architectural Digest India. “To have designs from Nilufar, one of the world's most important galleries, alongside fabrics from some of the most prestigious European textile houses, fabulous carpets from Jaipur Rugs, certified Indian antiquities from Natesan's [and more], all under one roof, would be a fabulous concept anywhere in the world, let alone in Worli.” Foster recalls how the debut collection of art works shown by Sabyasachi's Art Foundation — a series of female forms by artist Atish Mukherjee, in a contemporary take on the Bengal School of Art — were sold out on opening day. The prices ranged from ₹13.5 lakh to ₹52 lakh, and “people were fighting to buy them”, he shares. India is experiencing a retail boom, and luxury consumers are increasingly spoilt for choice as a proliferation of high-end, museum-esque stores are opening across the country. Western high-end brands too are launching targeted collections for the Indian customer. Four years ago, Bulgari, the Italian luxury fashion house that retails, among other things, classic jewellery with price tags that can easily go over ₹1 crore, debuted its version of the mangalsutra. The brand, which priced the piece at a fraction of their in-house designs, at around ₹13 lakh, hired actor Priyanka Chopra Jonas as its brand ambassador. In 2022, Louis Vuitton, the French luxury fashion house, which generated €20 billion in revenue globally, produced a capsule Rani Pink collection of shoes just for India for the festive season. And last year, long-time Indophile and fancy shoe designer Christian Louboutin, whose designs walk down red carpets at Cannes and the MET Gala, showcased a Diwali edit with velvet and brocade sandals and stilettos embroidered with zari. Many buyers who once limited their purchases to when they travelled abroad are no longer waiting to do so, instead preferring to shop in India. A day before luxury content creator Pooja Advani was leaving for her summer holidays to the U.S., she got a WhatsApp alert from a salesperson at Le Mill in Mumbai. The chic multi-brand luxury concept store was letting her know that the latest Alaïa collection had arrived. Advani, known for her trendy style in the city's social circles, had wanted a pair of the celebrated Parisian brand's sandals, prices for which start at an average of $900 (approx. 77,000). She did a quick online price comparison between India and the U.S., and immediately bought it. “I got the tip in advance, they had my size, the price compared, and I didn't have to leave my home. It's these small conveniences that make it easier to shop for luxury in India,” she says. Advani is just one of many clients that the Le Mill sales team has been steering towards the most au courant fashion as soon as it lands in the store — through a mix of WhatsApp messages and calls. Hitesh Rathod, creative director of Le Mill, says: “Many key pieces are sold even before they get uploaded on our website because our VVIP clients know exactly what they want,” he says. Luxury retail is not just about exclusivity anymore, it is also about accessibility. Especially in India. Over the past decade, a new affluent class has emerged, as the start-up culture and rise in stock market performance led to greater wealth generation amongst the top 2% of the population, many of them younger entrepreneurs. This class is more brand conscious and globally exposed. And after COVID-19, there appears to be a psychological shift amongst the rich to enjoy their lives and live in the present. This means that while there are still big numbers online (the e-retail market has surged to approximately $60 billion in gross merchandise value, according to global management firm Bain & Company), there is renewed interest in offline. “We are definitely seeing a strong resurgence in offline retail, particularly in the premium and luxury lifestyle segment,” says Abhishek Agarwal, founder of Purple Style Labs, which owns Pernia's Pop Up, the multi-brand fashion store, which recently took over the lease of the iconic 53,000 sq.ft. Ismail Building in Mumbai's Fort neighbourhood. Its counterpart in Chennai, on upscale Khader Nawaz Khan Road, is equally popular among wedding shoppers who browse their aisles and iPads, the latter making it easier for shop assistants to source from stores anywhere in the country. “There is a noticeable rise in omni-channel behaviour, where people are browsing collections online but coming to our stores for a deeper experience. While the pandemic significantly accelerated digital adoption, physical retail has come back with greater experiential demand,” he adds. Pernia's Pop Up is planning more large format stores in Mumbai, Delhi and New York. The proliferation of big and new players across India is strengthening this, be it malls such as Palladium and Emporio or the Ambani's Jio World Drive — which opened in 2021 with a roster of luxury brands making their debut in the country — or single-brand stores. The Collective, Aditya Birla Fashion & Retail's multi-brand offering, for instance, is growing in scale, and recently opened three new stores, bringing its total number to 40 across India. Adding to the mix is a slew of international brands entering our shores. Swiss watch imports grew nearly 30% in the first three months of 2025. Brands such as Breitling opened new boutiques in Hyderabad, Chennai, Pune and Gurugram, while Frank Mueller has plans to expand in Mumbai. “Today's luxury retail is about immersion, not just inventory. Store formats — whether standalone or mall-based — are being designed to create a high-touch, narrative-driven experience,” says Pranav Saboo, MD & CEO, Ethos Limited. “At Ethos, we've adopted a hybrid model. Our mono-brand boutiques are housed in luxury malls to capture footfall, while our large-format experiential spaces like City of Time in Gurugram, allow for deeper engagement. Interestingly, we're seeing hefty-ticket purchases even in mall stores, provided the brand story and experience align with consumer expectations.” Long gone are the days when prestige beauty products — part of celebrities' skincare routines, from actor Jennifer Lopez (a La Mer fan) to musician Taylor Swift (Chanel and Charlotte Tilbury) — were covetously purchased by Indians while on holiday. Today, Reliance-owned Tira Beauty, which debuted in 2023 to focus on high-end beauty, has opened 17 stores across India, while Nykaa announced plans for 350 stores by the end of the year. At the launch of the sprawling Tira store at Palladium two months ago, women across age groups were testing YSL lipsticks, Estée Lauder and La Mer skincare, Prada perfumes and K-beauty offerings while sipping on cocktails and Champagne. “Having a big store like this in the heart of Mumbai to browse in and test products, with good sales staff is helpful...."

mov_BE4198408FC8C0EA7B45D7A66D02ED79,2025-06-18 16:28:32,en,WEB,"  DEB NEVER SHARES NEW SINGLE  “BLUE” Deb Never by Ashlan Grey  “Blue” LISTEN: https://found.ee/DN-BLUE (June 18, 2025) - Washington state native Deb Never continues her run of singles with the release of “Blue” today. Deb's new track is the latest offering in a series of songs including “KNOW ME BETTER”, “This Alive” and “Not In Love”, that open up the next chapter of her career, with a refined, vulnerable approach to her songwriting that begins with just Deb and her guitar. Co-produced by Deb and frequent collaborator Romil Hemnani (BROCKHAMPTON, Paris Texas), “Blue” speaks to the inescapable sensations that come with falling for someone and the bravery it takes to give yourself over to someone else. Named after a color often associated with melancholy, the song's tenderness radiates warmth through Deb's delicate vocals and the dynamism of her guitar. Earlier this year, Deb joined Wallows on tour, playing some of her new songs and fan favorites to crowds at some of the biggest venues of her career across the Midwest and East Coast. Deb was also highlighted as one of Amazon Music's 2025 Artists to Watch, paving the way for her ascendancy with her highly-anticipated debut album on the horizon. Deb first emerged on the scene with her debut EP House on Wheels after making a standout contribution to BROCKHAMPTON's fifth studio album GINGER in 2019. Deb's artistic evolution continued with the release of two subsequent EPs, 2021's Where Have All The Flowers Gone? and Thank You For Attending in 2023, culminating in her debut full-length, which is slated for release in 2025. Deb has collaborated with peers, producers and songwriters like Kenny Beats, Biig Piig, Audrey Nuna, D33J, Shlohmo, Jim-E-Stack (Charli xcx, HAIM, Bon Iver), Michael Percy (Snoh Alegra, Joy Crookes), and Jam City (Olivia Rodrigo, Kelela, Troye Sivan), and has toured with Omar Apollo, Dominic Fike, slowthai and Tommy Genesis. Deb has also caught the eye of the fashion world, being featured in campaigns for the likes of Calvin Klein, YSL. GANNI, Burberry and Givenchy. Check out “Blue” above and stay tuned for more from Deb coming soon. “Blue” single artwork Connect with Deb Never  Instagram | X (Twitter) | YouTube"

tw_sl_f01ff70e88bca527a6860711ca2609dc,2025-06-18 19:43:15,en,WEB,"  ""You just had to be there."" Recognize that phrase? You've probably said it yourself when trying to describe something amazing to a friend. It's what you might say when words fall short—when you experience something so powerful and real, you can't possibly capture it in a photo or recreate it on a screen. There's also a chance that the moment wasn't serendipity. A brilliant brand using experiential marketing might have strategically planned it. The trouble today is that many brands—especially smaller, budget-strapped ones—aren't creating those ""you just had to be there"" moments. Most are all following the crowd, doing digital. And the world is drowning in digital because of it. We're overloaded. With email. With social. With ads. With AI-generated content and lookalike landing pages. Creators are burning out from content calendars. Small business owners are throwing money at Facebook ads that feel increasingly expensive and less effective. Consultants are cold-emailing prospects who delete messages without reading. Everyone's playing the same game. Experiential marketing lets you cut through all of that. While this article focuses primarily on in-person experiential marketing, which happens in real spaces with real people, advancing technology is also making powerful digital experiential moments possible through virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and immersive online platforms. No matter. Whether physical or digital, experiential marketing gives your audience something fundamentally different: genuine engagement and presence. And the best part? You don't need a massive budget or a team of dozens. You just need to stop thinking like everyone else and start creating moments people want to be part of. The many faces of experiential marketing Experiential marketing is about creating moments for people to engage with your brand, whether through their eyes, ears, hands, taste buds, or curiosity. For example, imagine: A financial advisor who hosts a retirement planning dinner at a local restaurant. If you're nearing retirement age, you've seen the postcards: free meal, free education, a chance to ask questions face to face. Way more effective than cold-calling about 401ks. A home decor brand with an AR app that lets customers virtually place furniture in rooms, complete with suggested lighting adjustments and style recommendations based on their space. Amazon has such an AR app now. An online course creator who hosts a live workshop at a coworking space, turning digital followers into a real-world community. An artist who creates an intimate album release event that's part concert, part spiritual experience. Attendees don't just hear the music—they feel it. A local winery that offers wine-tasting classes to teach you about terroir and grape varieties. You learn, you taste, you join their wine club. Smart! I experienced that last example at St. Paul Mountain Vineyards, a beautiful winery close to my home. The tasting class was so good—educational, engaging, personal—that my husband and I walked out as wine club members. Mwah! That's conversion right there. Here's what I learned: Even if your business lives entirely online, experiential marketing gives you a way to step into the physical world and create real connections. Your digital audience is a gathering of real people living in real places. Why not give them reasons to gather physically to interact with you and your brand? That's key: Inviting participation instead of demanding attention. This way, people won't just hear what you do; they'll step into it. And that's a different kind of convincing and trust-building entirely. Experiential marketing lets people convince themselves..."
myinoc8,2025-06-18 20:57:11,en,REDDIT,"  Additional comment to elaborate on my choices (not that anyone asked...) Debut is very green, something young people can wear that doesn't scream VS body sprays. Something that says ""Please take me seriously, I can be a grown woman"" and should be very accessible. I think Elizabeth Arden Green Tea fits that. Its more solar counterpart with Sunflowers fits Beautiful Eyes EP. Aside from the name 'Love Story' being fitting, I think it's a very great scent that's very clean and palatable to many -- which is what Fearless, being her breakthrough album, represents. The top notes are still very bright and citrusy, which represents her youth very well. YSL Libre is kind of a more mature version of it, still white florals being the main accords, but it has that richer vanilla working in the back. I have never had the chance to smell Wonderstruck, but I thought it would be the best choice given it was that era. Based on its notes, it's mostly fruity. So for Speak Now TV, I chose something that was also fruity, but a bit more sophisticated, and that was Chance Eau Tendre. The color of the perfume itself also fits very well with the TV tutu dress photoshoot. For Red, Very Good Girl's notes are litchi, red currant, and rose - which are mostly red. And the bottle design? ""He didn't like it when I wore high heels..."" I think Red is a great album navigating trying to be more mature, but also holding on to your youth. There's a freshness to Very Good Girl thanks to its fruity top notes, but a grounded maturity in its vanilla and vetiver finish. For the TV, I chose Girl of Now which is very almond-y (and a great scent for fall!) , but its tonka bean/cashmere base notes feel like a more refined version. It's kind of like comparing OG ATW and the 10MVTV. 1989 is Le Labo Santal 33, which is NY in a bottle. The TV is Bois Imperial, which is the now more bougie NY scent in a bottle. Still on a santal-related note, Taylor was supposedly confirmed to use TF Santal Blush during rep era. I personally love spicy woody scents, and it has a nice intrigue to it, but the middle floral notes can still make it light enough to wear. Lover is Miss Dior. A nice sweet romantic scent (peach x roses), with a lot of sensuality going on in the back (tonka bean, benzoin). I chose La Vie Est Belle for the LFP which is a lot sweeter, but has that same sensual floral going for it. folklore I smell as something more woody, but still light. I think Mojave Ghost has that balance. evermore with TF Tobacco Vanille (which Taylor also uses) still has that woody accord, but evokes more smokiness. Midnights I think is perfectly encapsulated by Black Opium. It has that cozy vanilla - coffee scent that will keep you up and fades into a woody patchouli. Patchouli is associated with masking the smell of weed, can be an essential oil or incense. ""Cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf..."" TTPD is Mugler Angel because she is an absolute mess. If you look at the notes, you're just like, what the heck is going on here. She's polarizing, but she's literally a star. The bottle itself is a star. But she's endured decades and is still considered a classic. The Anthology to me evokes a lot of introspection, with many of the songs told in the lenses of hindsight. To me, the songs are like stories I would share with someone over drinks in a booth. Jazz Club hits that sweet-smoky scent that makes you feel like you're reminiscing over hazy memories. Lastly, Christmas is the smell of freshly baked cookies, and Vanille 44 gets it perfectly. Other gourmands could work too. (omg this is so long im so sorry)"

Then radio city music hall, the the garden,  coliseum even the carrier dome in Syracuse. So many wonderful venues. Even the pleasure of having nice little chats with your husband. I'm thrilled that he actually recognized me. Or at least had the demeanor to make me believe he did. I think the former is the case. Heartfelt long story aside,    I reference the album often. Most particularly as is my custom,   I listen to it daily for the month of December. Every December since 1972. For some reason had to share. Met you too in the Hamptons. It's was a Peter Beard ysl thing..."

High-demand categories included dresses, fragrances, watches, T-shirts, and accessories, while premium gifting surged with brands like MANGO, Fossil, Calvin Klein, and Hidesign seeing over 4x growth. Among the top-performing brands on M-Now are Levi's, USPA, Jack & Jones, Tommy Hilfiger, Vero Moda, YSL, Bobbi Brown, Dyson, Estee Lauder, Prada, L'Oréal, and Maybelline. New brands recently added to the fast-delivery lineup include Marks & Spencer, Snitch, Pantaloons, Decathlon, and YSL. “Speed is one of the core principles of the best-in-class customer experience that Myntra is renowned for,” said Sharon Pais, Chief Business Officer at Myntra. “With M-Now, we're redefining what convenience means in fashion by marrying speed with the width of selection and platform experience.” Myntra said the pilot runs of M-Now in Delhi-NCR and Mumbai delivered strong results, particularly during Mother's Day, when apparel category orders surged 3.5x compared to regular days. The company has long offered faster-than-average delivery through its M-Express service, which currently fulfills nearly 50% of orders within 48 hours across over 600 cities. With M-Now, Myntra is now pushing the envelope further by turning speed into a strategic advantage in India's competitive e-commerce fashion landscape."

myut9gu,2025-06-20 18:25:01,en,REDDIT,"  A lot of people here telling you to buy from a different trusted discounter and that this amazon listing is probably a scam would usually be right. What some people don't realize is that this listing is specifically from YSL's amazon store front. They are currently running a special on their amazon store. Designer brands do this often. Just last week it was Armani doing a sale on their official amazon store front. All you have to do is visit the official Amazon Store Front for YSL to see these products are on sale right now. I just checked myself(no pun intended) and its legit. Its being shipped and sold by amazon on the listing. There is however reason in avoiding amazon other times - you need to be careful because anyone can sell fragrances on amazon and there definitely are fakes on amazon. If anything does happen, you can always talk to an amazon agent for a refund if this particular sale goes wrong"

BC90B71E5A94AE3A0DB06AAC7B0A4A74,2025-06-20 22:01:35,en,PRINT,"  Amidst critical operational challenges in the quick commerce sector related to hiring and retaining delivery partners, ecommerce major Myntra has rolled out its 30-minute delivery service M-Now in Delhi NCR and Mumbai.Myntra piloted M-Now in Bengaluru in December last year, initially with about 10,000 stock-keeping units (SKUs). ET had reported on December 4 that the online fashion company plans to take the service to Mumbai, New Delhi and Pune in the coming months.Myntra chief executive Nandita Sinha, had told ET in an interview that the fashion etailer had identified significant demand from fashion-first and trend-focused premium customers for quick deliveries, adding that customers are looking for access to their preferred brands with speedy fulfilment.Under M-Now, customers can find collections from nearly 600 brands, including Vero Moda, Mango, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Levi's, Dyson, YSL, Prada, Carolina Herrera, Huda Beauty, the company said.What does this mean for quick commerce?M-Now's presence in Delhi-NCR makes it pivotal in joining the quick commerce race, and offering multiple brands in one click.In April, data sourced by ET revealed that Myntra is seeing sharp growth in vacation-related shopping. Summer-ready styles in apparel and footwear—such as sundresses, skirts, shorts, cotton shirts, swimwear, flip flops and sandals—are seeing strong traction.Myntra said demand for these categories rose around 2.2 times year-on-year in March and April compared to the beginning of the year. Popular brands in this space include H&M, MANGO, Puma, Crocs, US Polo, Tommy Hilfiger, Adidas, Trendyol and Levi's. Standardised products readily available with convenient return options are likely to spur demand on quick commerce platforms like M-Now, Myntra's M-Express has already been popular with customers, delivering orders in one to two business days.Thus, expanding to Delhi-NCR and Mumbai region would open opportunities to tap urban consumers looking for quick deliveries.In FY24, Myntra posted a net profit of Rs 30.9 crore against revenue of Rs 5,173.7 crore.Rising competitionQuick commerce now accounts for 20% of India's ecommerce market and is growing at a rate of 50% annually, Walmart International chief executive Kathryn McLay said in May. Walmart-backed Flipkart's Q-comm entity Flipkart Minutes, is targeting 800 dark stores by the end of 2025. Companies such as Zepto are in advanced talks with Edelweiss Alternative Asset, domestic family offices and smaller credit funds for around Rs 1,500 crore structured debt.Blinkit had an annualised GOV of $3.6 billion in the quarter ended December 31, 2024. Swiggy Instamart posted an annualised gross sales run rate of $1.8 billion in the same quarter.As price becomes the primary differentiator for these apps with near-similar user experience, intense discounting and attendant cash burn are likely to intensify further, a recent report by ET highlighted.This month, average discounts across categories rose to 20–25% on maximum retail price compared to below 10% two years ago across various quick commerce platforms, including for segments like dairy and groceries, the sources said.

mov_7AF13719EB8F45CAEC20E99A76949456,2025-06-21 04:35:19,en,WEB,"  Tech News Myntra has expanded its 30-minute delivery service, M-Now, to Delhi-NCR and Mumbai, after a successful launch in Bengaluru. The service now offers over 90,000 fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products from 600+ brands. Backed by 40+ dark stores, M-Now aims to meet both impulse and urgent shopping needs in top metros. New Delhi: Myntra launched a 30-minute delivery M-Now service in Bengaluru and has now launched it in Delhi-NCR and Mumbai. By this, the company is intensifying its presence in the emerging quick commerce market with its customers that want to get their fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products and have immediate satisfaction. It has more than 90,000 products of more than 600 brands that are covered by the service in the three major cities. It can be facilitated in these cities by the presence of a strong network of 40+ dark stores. M-Now has experienced an approximate doubling of orders per day in the recent quarter, with fashion being the main. The company also hopes to serve impulse purchases and immediate necessities and has unprecedented fast delivery in a market that has always been dominated by online planned purchases. Key events driving spike in demand Myntra claimed that it had experienced huge surges in orders when there were major events. During Valentine's Day, orders increased by 4.5 times, whereas the number of new customers increased by 5 times. The same was the case on Mother's Day, where there was a 3.5x increase in apparel orders. Sales of the RCB jersey increased sixfold during the IPL finale through M-Now, underscoring how live trends can be captured through real-time delivery. Best categories and best brands Some of the most demanded products include T-shirts, jeans, dresses, kurta sets, lipsticks and perfumes. M-Now has the best brands, such as Levi, MANGO, Tommy Hilfiger, Bobbi Brown, L'Oréal, and Prada. Marks and Spencer, Snitch, Pantaloons, Decathlon and YSL are new labels added to the list that indicates that Myntra is aiming at providing greater diversity between the premium and the mass market. Growth beyond fashion: Summer and travel boost Though fashion is at the head, lifestyle and seasonal requirements also gain ground. The summer travel is what has pushed the trolley bag orders up 5 times and the demand for backpacks up 2 times. Myntra is using these trends in guiding the products it offers on M-Now, a condition that ensures that it fulfils the various needs of its customers. M-Now by Myntra is a successor of M-Express that has already proved to ship almost half of all orders in 48 hours to more than 600 cities in India. M-Now will make the company break new grounds, as it will allow faster intra-city delivery, furthering the pace in the fashion e-commerce industry.

mov_11EA77D75D52E508A4B1C9E0E8E81EB3,2025-06-21 09:12:55,en,WEB,"  Myntra expands its 'M-Now' 30-minute delivery to Delhi-NCR and Mumbai after Bengaluru success. This service focuses on delivering clothes from premium brands. Customers can now get rapid delivery on items from Vero Moda, Mango, Calvin Klein, and more. Other fashion platforms like Ajio and Nykaa are also exploring ultra-fast delivery. Myntra has rolled out its ""M-Now"" 30-minute delivery service to Delhi-NCR and Mumbai, following a successful pilot in Bengaluru, a report has said. Unlike Blinkit, Zepto and other food-related quick commerce platforms, M-Now will specifically focus on delivering clothes, including from premium brands, in 30-minutes. Notably, Blinkit and Zepto also deliver some basic apparels such as tees and shorts. The M-Now service, first trialed in Bengaluru last December with around 10,000 SKUs, now offers collections from nearly 600 brands. Customers in the expanded zones can now get rapid delivery on items from popular names like Vero Moda, Mango, Calvin Klein, Tommy Hilfiger, Levi's and even luxury beauty and accessory brands such as Dyson, YSL, Prada, Carolina Herrera, and Huda Beauty, as per a report by The Economic Times.Myntra CEO Nandita Sinha had previously indicated the company's plans to bring the service to Mumbai, New Delhi and Pune. She noted a ""significant demand from fashion-first and trend-focused premium customers for quick deliveries."" Myntra's move is part of a larger trend in India's e-commerce landscape, where fashion platforms like Ajio and Nykaa, along with new-age brands such as Newme, Slikk and Blip, are all exploring ultra-fast delivery. This momentum was initially sparked by quick commerce pioneers like Blinkit, Instamart, and Zepto, who expanded beyond groceries to include fashion and apparel from brands like Jockey, Manyavar, Puma, and Adidas.The report also pointed out the challenges, saying that one key hurdle is customer behaviour. As per as Snitch founder Siddharth Dungarwal, while initial interest in fast delivery is high, shoppers often revert to purchasing only basic wardrobe essentials like black t-shirts or shirts through these services."

mov_F6F43F0CAFD388D947BFA3F04D320CA9,2025-06-22 06:05:36,en,WEB,"  wearing Miu Miu “The world has irrecoverably changed, and I want to make sure that it is for the better, because we are on a path that I fundamentally do not believe is towards destruction,” says Kiara Nirghin , a South African-born technologist, author, and sustainability advocate who studied at Stanford. The 24-year-old, who wears Miu Miu for her Schön! 48  digital cover story , has earned her place on influential lists such as Forbes' Generation Disrupter and Glamour Magazine's College Women of the Year , thanks to her deep commitment to purpose-driven problem-solving. Her work has gained international acclaim, including the Grand Prize at the Google Science Competition for a data and tech-driven climate change innovation. Problem-solving, for Nirghin, is a passion. “I've always been fascinated by how different parts of a system work together,” she reflects. “Even as a kid, I loved building and analysing algorithms; figuring out how we could improve models to change the way people interact with technology.” With artificial intelligence now at the centre of global conversation, Nirghin acknowledges the debates that inevitably come with transformative technologies. But for her, it's not about resisting progress but rather about embracing it with intention. “I hold two fundamental beliefs close to my heart,” she explains. “First, I'm a technology explorationist. I believe in pushing technology as far as possible because that's how society progresses. Second, ignoring the inevitable is the worst decision we can make.” To Nirghin, these principles must go hand in hand. “Whether we talk about AI or not, it is going to get developed, and depending on where you are geographically, if there is a difficulty in having the conversations or funding researchers, [AI] is just going to advance elsewhere,” she points out. As co-founder and CTO of CHIMA , a San Francisco-based startup backed by some of Silicon Valley's most respected venture capital firms, Nirghin is working to redefine generative AI's role across industries. The company is dedicated to developing advanced models that are not only powerful but also responsible, sustainable, and effective. She credits CHIMA 's beginnings to a shared vision with her co-founder and sister, Nikhara: “The future is being built right now, and we're living in the era of exponential change where technology and bold thinking are reshaping what's possible in real time.” Through CHIMA , they are exploring the “more daring, open and abundant realities” that emerge where AI meets human potential. It's a venture that perfectly blends curiosity with creativity. “We want to see what technology can do in accelerating the world. We call ourselves tech support on the side,” she says, laughing. Nirghin's fascination with technology extends beyond AI into other creative realms, including fashion. A devoted Prada enthusiast, she quips, “P is for Prada, but I also think it's for Pioneers.” At the core of her passion is the belief that we are only beginning to uncover what's possible. “We are so early in this [technology] journey that it is so incredibly exciting to talk about,” she says, adding, “and these technological advancements are going to be the most important [advancements] we have in this decade.” As Nirghin sees it, the future is already in the making.

His set capped the three-day Lyrical Lemonade Summer Smash festival outside Chicago and, beyond the guest spots, also featured several live debuts, rarities and covers. The set opened with two songs from the influential 2021 compilation Slime Language 2 (“Take It to Trial” and “Slatty”) and then moved into the Future collaboration “Killed Before” and the live debut of “Jonesboro” from the 2023 album BUSINESS IS BUSINESS. Scott appeared 15 songs into the show, rattling off his verse from “Hot” and then lighting up the crowd with his trademark “FEIN.” More from Spin: Introduced by Thug as an “old head,” T.I. turned back the clock with “About the Money,” which was one of Thug's first major guest appearances as a rising young artist back in 2014. In a nod to both the present and the future, he brought out Ken Carson for the live debut of their new song “R.I.P Scuti,” which is expected to appear on Thug's long-awaited new album, UY Scuti, this summer. The set wound down with a cover of Lil Baby's “Dum, Dumb, and Dumber” and “Money on Money,” the first song released ahead of the upcoming album. Prior to gaining his freedom, Young Thug was in jail since his May 2022 arrest for allegedly leading the street gang YSL. With his return to the stage complete, he'll perform next moht at festivals in Germany, Belgium, Romania, Switzerland and Poland.

1️⃣What Goes Around Comes Around——纽约
SoHo的WGACA以100%真品古董手袋和配饰出名，Hadid，Jenners和Beckhams都曾来过，Hermès、Chanel、Louis Vuitton全都有保障，还有比弗利山庄分店。 2️⃣Vintage Delirium——米兰
隐藏在Via Giuseppe Sacchi小巷的Vintage Delirium，由艺术收藏家Franco Jacassi于1985年开店，每件单品都像有故事的艺术品，这里也是意大利时尚宠儿Chiara Ferragni的最爱。 3️⃣ Amore Vintage——东京
表参道上的Amore Vintage专注高端古董包，Chanel、Hermès款式超多，环境清爽好拍照，买包就像在逛小型博物馆，不少资深爱好者直呼“Chanel天堂”，客户名单包括Alexa Chung，Bella Hadid，Hailey Bieber等。 4️⃣ Time's Up Vintage——哥本哈根
从街头workwear到精致设计师单品都收得特别全，从经典的香奈儿套装到Helmut Lang和Prada，各种价位的高品质单品应有尽有，Naomi Campbell，Lady Gaga都是这家店的顾客。 5️⃣ Das Neue Schwarz——柏林
这家店更像个极简派艺术画廊，主打YSL、Hermès、Comme des Garçons等比利时与日本设计师古着，干净利落的陈列让你挑件衣服都像在看展，不用费劲地翻堆，直接锁定高品质。 6️⃣ Rellik——伦敦
诺丁山的Rellik在之前的笔记中我们就有提过，从1930s到90s的西太后、CDG等设计师经典都能翻到，价格跨度大但品质超硬，逛一圈就能感受到那种淘到独一无二宝贝的成就感。 有没有都去过的富哥富姐评价一下，哪家是你的最爱？ #时尚聚集地 #中古店 #vintage #古着店 #时尚是轮回"

mov_E2D3547B7A1A306E443060A92B2A454E,2025-06-24 16:06:08,en,WEB,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Lila Moss channelled her mother's infamous racy looks as she went braless beneath a sheer top while heading out amid Paris Fashion Week on Tuesday. The model, 22, was sure to turn heads as she flashed her assets beneath the see-through black number - which she teamed with a leg-flashing pink ruffled skirt - as she left her hotel for the YSL show. Lila's skirt featured a high hem at the front with a flowing train, while she boosted her height with a black of pointed black heels. Later, as she posed outside the Saint Laurent Menswear Spring/Summer 2026 show, Lila covered her modesty by draping her long, blonde locks over her front. She oozed confidence as she posed up a storm in the sunshine while showing off the risqué outfit. Lila's daring look echoes that of her supermodel mother, 51, who over the years has stunned in a number of braless ensembles. In 1996, Kate famously dared to bare in a sheer embellished number as she walked for Versace during Paris Fashion week. While three years earlier, she caught the eye by going braless beneath a shimmering silver slip dress while puffing on a cigarette at an The Elite Model Agency Party at London's Hilton hotel. Lila is the daughter of Kate and Dazed Media CEO Jefferson Hack, 52, who the supermodel was in a relationship with in the early 2000s. She has followed in Kate's model footsteps and nabbed her first modelling gig at the age of 15 with a Marc Jacobs Beauty campaign - just a year older than her mother was when she entered the business. Despite her mother being one of the famous models in the business, Lila revealed that Kate was keen to deter her from following in her footsteps. 'My mum always put me off [modelling],' Lila said. ' She was always like, 'If you want to do it, you can, but I wouldn't recommend it.' As well as her flourishing career, Lila's love life has been thriving as she has been dating Yoni Helbitz, 23, for roughly 18 months. In August 2023, MailOnline exclusively revealed that Lila's boyfriend was Yoni, with the pair seen out in London frequently together over those summer months. Last year a source confirmed the couple, who were first pictured together as friends in 2021, had been dating for around a year. Yoni's official job title is e-commerce coordinator/ fashion marketer for fashion brand Self Portrait. Before that, he worked as an e-commerce co-ordinator for James Lakeland Ltd and he also had a six months stint as an estate agent. The happy couple had kept their romance relatively under wraps, yet Instagram posts by Yoni reveal they have been enjoying each other's company for quite some time. The fashion marketer's page features several snaps of himself enjoying dinner dates and days out with Lila amid their blossoming romance. Though Yoni is happy to share images of his famous girlfriend on social media, Lila keeps her page relatively professional."

sJ-o0W2cF8Y,2025-06-24 17:01:06,en,YOUTUBE,"  Lauren Abedini, widely known by her artist moniker KITTENS, has established herself as dynamic force within the music, fashion, and beauty industries over the past decade. Her multifaceted profile as a DJ, music producer, host, content creator, creative strategist, and intersectional advocate, positions her as a standout figure with a profound impact and understanding across various creative domains. Growing up on the outskirts of Los Angeles, Lauren ventured into the local nightlife and music scene at an early age, stoking her creative flame. With her vast knowledge and relentless curiosity for music, KITTENS established herself as a tastemaker and trail blazer for women in dance music. Her infectious DJ sets garnered support from some of the most influential artists of our time, including Usher, Kid Cudi, Skrillex and A-Trak while earning opportunities to DJ the most coveted stages, from iconic global festivals including Coachella and EDC, to residencies in Las Vegas. As an Iranian- American, queer, woman, KITTENS is unapologetic about her intersectional identity. She has used this fearlessness to inspire other women through her podcast SHE/HER/THEY and charity driven DJ workshops, PWR. Through SHE/HER/THEY, Lauren has crafted a unique space where listeners andtop notch guests,such as iconic musicians Demi Lovato & Kehlani, and esteemed actors Sarah Shahi & Alexandra Shipp, are nurtured to embark on a journey of unfiltered authenticity exploration. Candid dialogue around themes of identity, gender, sexuality, career, and creativity take center stage, empowering listeners to free themselves from societal expectations in pursuit of genuine happiness. While PWR offers women and gender expansive folks a place to explore new creative endeavors in a safe and encouraging space. Through both of these projects, KITTENS is able to empower those who have gone through life without feeling seen to explore identity and life without boundaries. Lauren's prowess in crafting thoughtful social, creative, and music strategies has led to impactful collaborations with globally renowned brands, including YSL Beauté, Adidas, Tiffany & Co., Amazon Music, Moncler, Dior, Coach, HBO, and more. Whether commanding main stages at Coachella, orchestrating insightful conversations with A-List talent on her podcast, or championing educational initiatives for marginalized communities, Lauren keeps inclusivity and cultural impact as her guiding light."

▲科爸好奇為何網路上賣得如此便宜，好奇心驅使下買回做實驗，得出的結果嚇出一身冷汗。 (圖/陳佳鈴攝)
不少人都有迷思，大品牌專罐香水動輒數千元起跳，為何在許多網拍賣場價格卻差十萬八千里，同樣的品牌幾百元就能買到？ 甚至還貼心地按照預算直接方你分裝成小瓶！ 說穿了便宜香水有9成以上都是假貨，台中化妝品公會理事長「科爸」以大學系所實驗室在使用的天然物分析儀器，來精密分析假香水跟真香水的成分，實測後得出驚人的數字，塑化劑含量高達67%，超過法定含量0.01％的限制，等於買了一瓶香水噴在身上的有67%都是塑化劑，實測結果只能說「嚇壞人」！ 科爸除了本身是化妝品專業，也因平常這些保養品、化妝品，都是家中的寶貝女兒會接觸到，因此更關注品質。 尤其最近發現許多網拍賣場的香水便宜到嚇人，在好奇心的驅使下決定開始用儀器當作照妖鏡，讓大眾看看到底這些香水的成分是甚麼？ ▲科爸買回的網路便宜香水（右），仿香奈兒香水的瓶身，卻是YSL香水的香氣，一瓶只賣88元，在網路銷售顯示已經賣出上千組。 (圖/陳佳鈴攝)
一瓶是專櫃正品的CHANNEL 5°，另一瓶是他從蝦皮買來的「一樣是CHANNEL 5°的瓶身，實際上卻是YSL的香水味道」。 使用台中弘光科技大學化妝品科系的天然物分析實驗室，使用GCMARTS儀器來實測「蝦皮便宜香水」的成分，科爸指著電腦銀幕上的數據「打出來有一個波峰很高的弧線，結構是跟塑化劑相似度高達97%，而且它在裡面占比有67%的濃度，作為香水的定香氣，這東西用多了，就是人的賀爾蒙會產生影響。」 科爸說「像在台灣有七種塑化劑，它的含量限制是不能超過100ppm，就是0.01%內，但這個(假貨)驗出來的百分比總共有67%，塑化劑67%vs0.01%那個是差天壤之別，它（超濃塑化劑）會影響你的賀爾蒙。」 ▲▼科爸把兩者帶到弘光大學的實驗室測試，正牌香水成分符合規定，但便宜香水（下圖）曲線超標顯示為塑化劑的含量。 (圖/陳佳鈴攝)
科爸進一步說明，塑化劑如DEP在化妝品中的常見使用情境：作為香精溶劑或揮發性載體，常見於香水或保養品中。 通常用量為 0.1%~3%左右，極少數會到5%，已算高濃度。 這個假貨67% 幾乎是整個產品三分之二，等於直接拿 DEP 當主體基劑，這與香水常見的酒精使用不同，無實際需求與合理性DEP在化妝品雖未被禁，目前顯示研究顯示長期暴露可能與過敏性疾病有關（如喘鳴、氣喘），懷孕婦女建議應避免過度使用含DEP留滯型產品如假香水等，以減低對胎兒的影響。 最可怕的是市面上有多少號稱是「平替」或「致敬」的仿冒香，就因為氣味沒有專利，就堂而皇之的公然剽竊這些成名作，道德是一回事，安全又是另一層隱憂。 至於正品牌的香水實測結果，數據顯示「我們測一般品牌的香水是沒有假香水的這種情況，可以安心使用。」 科爸說，這像實測是一個爸爸想跟大家說，為什麼不要買來路不明的香水？ 塑化劑多到不敢想像，分享給長輩、孩子，愛美的女性男性朋友，千萬不要貪小便宜。 更多三立新聞網報導

mov_5BFE80C412E8F3EDB5135AA62CBC78E4,2025-06-26 09:00:36,en,WEB,"  Looking for the scent of the summer can often be an expensive job, but it doesn't have to be this way. With many body mists setting you back almost £40, it's no wonder people are turning to dupes - but they never pack the same punch as the original product, and they can often leave you feeling disappointed and wondering why you didn't just fork out the money for the real thing. This is the precise reason I recently turned to a retro product for my body spray needs, and it truly does last all day, and it won't make your wallet weep when you purchase. What's my holy grail body spray? Of course, like many others, I use body spray as a base layer before perfume. So it doesn't need to be super strong because I want it to complement my fragrance, rather than overpower it. But this is why the So...? body sprays are perfect. So many of us used them when we were younger, so there's a bit of snobbery around them, but this locker-room favourite packs such a punch, and some of the new scents are amazing and well worth a try. I absolutely love the Vanilla one because it's strong and provides the perfect layer that sticks to your clothes and lasts ages. It's simple, but is the most 'true' vanilla scent that I think I've ever tried. So many try to be fancy with different notes, but I just want pure vanilla, because it makes you smell amazing when you spritz it after a few hours of being out and about, too. But my latest obsession (which, to be fair, has lasted a few months so far) is the So...? Red Velvet spray. I bought it from Amazon, and I think it cost me around £3.50, which I thought was a great price. But you can get it even cheaper in shops like Wilko, where it'll set you back just £2.50, or £2 in Bodycare. It's so good that I'd be more than happy paying up to a tenner for it because it really works. I can spray it at 8am as I get ready, go about my day, exercise, and get sweaty in the afternoon, and I'll still be smelling good. And if that's not a glowing review, I don't know what is. It's hard to describe the scent. Some say that it's exactly like red velvet cake, but there's something a little more sophisticated about it. It's certainly sweet, though, and on first spray, I thought it smelled slightly like a less strong version of YSL's Black Opium. Definitely not identical, but quite close. I even took it on holiday with me and chose to use it every day, which again, is a glowing review, as normally I'll have at least four body sprays on rotation. For the price, you really can't beat this body spray. While it may not have the most luxe packaging or be a designer brand, at least when you walk past people, you'll smell absolutely delicious."
mov_F3004DF993A6D5D28ECCB085B315F34F,2025-06-26 11:48:59,en,WEB,"  FSN E-Commerce Ventures expects strong margin gains and repeat business to help Nykaa Fashion achieve profitability, while brand GMV target for FY30 is set at Rs 6,000 crore FSN E-Commerce Ventures, the parent company of beauty and personal care brand Nykaa, aims to grow its fashion business—Nykaa Fashion—by 3–4x over the next five years, with a profitability target of 10 per cent EBITDA margins. Nykaa is betting on improved margins on the back of strong repeat business along with growth in its own brands. Nykaa is expecting the fashion business to be EBITDA breakeven by FY26. For FY25, the EBITDA was a negative 8.3 per cent. The company outlined its future focus to analysts at its Annual Investors Day. It also announced that House of Nykaa, its brand business, is targeting a GMV of Rs 6,000 crore by FY30, growing at a compounded annual growth rate of 30 per cent. In FY25, House of Nykaa crossed Rs 2,100 crore in GMV. Five brands crossed Rs 100 crore GMV, including three at over Rs 200 crore. In FY25, Nykaa Fashion had a gross merchandise value (GMV) of Rs 3,800 crore. Nykaa also announced the launch of NykaaNow. The firm is aiming for order fulfilment in 30–120 minutes and is available in seven cities. At present, about 80 per cent of orders in the top 12 cities are fulfilled the same day or next day, whereas across 110 cities, 70 per cent of orders are fulfilled the same day or next day. The company said that its total GMV has grown at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42 per cent over the past five years, more than double the broader e-commerce market CAGR of around 18–20 per cent. Its customer base now exceeds 42 million, and its omnichannel network has expanded to 237 stores. Falguni Nayar, executive chairperson, founder and chief executive officer, Nykaa, said: “Over the last five years, our beauty business has scaled 5x and fashion has grown 20x, outpacing the broader ecommerce growth. Even in a cautious macro, we've continued to grow with discipline and purpose. Beauty remains a powerhouse, our B2B play is scaling well, and we see recovering momentum in fashion.” Nykaa also said that premiumisation is accelerating, with Gen Z now accounting for 44 per cent of BPC spend. Global brands like CHANEL, Kérastase, YSL, NARS and Eucerin are scaling fast on Nykaa's platform, with many in the top 100, said the company."

With many body mists setting you back almost £40, it's no wonder people are turning to dupes 15:04, 26 Jun 2025 The spray smells so good and is cheap too (stock image)(Image: g-stockstudio via ) Hunting for the perfect summer fragrance can often be a costly affair, but it doesn't have to break the bank. With some body mists costing nearly £40, it's no surprise that people are seeking cheaper alternatives, including dupes. However, these imitations rarely match up to the original and can leave you feeling let down, questioning why you didn't just splurge on the genuine article. This exact predicament led me to revisit an old-school product for my body spray needs. It genuinely lasts all day without causing your purse any distress upon purchase. So what's my favourite body spray? Like many others, I use body spray as a foundational layer before applying perfume. Therefore, it doesn't need to be overly potent as its role is to enhance my perfume, not overpower it. That's precisely why So...? body sprays hit the mark. Many of us used them in our younger years, leading to a certain snobbery surrounding them. However, this school locker staple packs a punch, and some of their new fragrances are truly impressive and worth a try. I'm particularly fond of the Vanilla variant. It's robust and provides an enduring layer that clings to your clothes. It's straightforward, yet it's the most authentic vanilla scent I believe I've ever encountered. Article continues below Many brands attempt to jazz up their products with various notes, but all I crave is pure vanilla. It leaves you smelling divine when you give yourself a quick spritz after a few hours out and about. However, my latest fixation (which has been ongoing for a few months now) is the So...? Red Velvet spray. I purchased it from Amazon for around £3.50, which I considered to be quite a bargain. Content cannot be displayed without consent You can find it even cheaper in stores like Wilko, where it's priced at just £2.50, or for £2 in Bodycare. It's so effective that I wouldn't mind shelling out up to £10 for it. I can spritz it on at 8am while getting ready, go about my day, exercise, work up a sweat in the afternoon, and still smell delightful. If that isn't high praise, I don't know what is. Describing the fragrance is tricky. Some liken it to red velvet cake, but there's an added sophistication to it. It's definitely sweet, and upon first application, I thought it bore a slight resemblance to a milder version of YSL's Black Opium. Not an exact match, but fairly close. I even brought it along on holiday and opted to use it daily, which is another testament to its quality, as I usually rotate between at least four body sprays. Article continues below Given its price point, this body spray is unbeatable. While it may not come in the most luxurious packaging or bear a designer label, rest assured, you'll leave a trail of delicious scent wherever you go."

Because while I enjoy - no love - being beautifully bronzed as much as the next person, I find the process with its associated exfoliating, shaving, meticulous application, smells and tiresome mess off-putting. In winter I forgo the business altogether. I am fair and fine with it, especially when snuggled in jeans and winter wool. But as the weather warms each year my urge for glowing skin returns. And so, over the years, I've stayed committed - through much mess, frustration and more than a few questionable outcomes - to finding the best of the best glow-givers that can be tolerated, even enjoyed by…particularly people like me. Fuss free, as easy as they come to use and delivering the most seamless results I won't be without this tanning team: Fake tans for the face… The instant: ByTerry Tea-To Tan Face & Body Travel Size, (£22, cultbeauty.co.uk) Makeup formulator extraordinaire Terry de Gunzberg designed Touche Eclat for YSL beauty before founding her own brand celebrating fresh, natural faces and skin-friendly formulas. This bronzing spritz is my go-to for last minute panics and delivers an instant, transfer-proof and beautifully subtle tint without the use of tanning actives - which means…no smell! The gradual: Sisley The Self Tanning Hydrating Facial skincare, (£120, sisley.co.uk) I appreciate that this is frighteningly expensive, but Sisley's skincare is best-in-class when it comes to delivering first-rate formulas and visible results. No exception to the rule, this buildable, seamless gradual bronzer is packed with antioxidants and skin-quenching actives so that skin is left not just bronzed, but perfectly soft, plumped and supple too. The classic: Isle of Paradise Drops Light, (£13.10, amazon.co.uk) This totally brilliant tanner comes in three tones to best match your skin and is designed to be mixed with your daily moisturiser or serum, making it thrillingly easy to use, even under makeup. With Vitamin C it also works to brighten and even the complexion. Fake tans for the body... The instant: Vita Liberata Body Blur, (£30, vitaliberata.com) Like an Instagram filter for your limbs, this clever formula leaves skin looking not just bronzed but more smooth and even too (bye-bye bruises). A firm favorite with beauty editors and makeup artists, it comes in five shades and is best applied with a tanning mitt. Before diving in, be warned that a little goes a long way! The gradual: Tan Luxe The Gradual Illuminating Tanning Lotion (£25, cultbeauty.co.uk) This gradual tan is The One. A clever oil-cream hybrid, it smooths and conditions skin and develops in only an hour so you can apply it after work and still shower before bed if you wish! The classic: Jimmy Coco Tinted Tan Soufflé Face & Body, (£29, jimmycoco.co.uk) A friend put me onto this brilliant mousse infused with Hyaluronic Acid, and I haven't looked back. It's the most foolproof tan I've used - so reliable, it even came through when I had to apply it in the dark. (Don't ask.) With a scent that's genuinely inoffensive, it delivers a beautifully subtle, natural-looking bronze. I stick to the light shade, and when I want a deeper result, I simply apply it two nights in a row - a method I find far more reliable and relaxing than jumping to a darker tint."

mov_B074E920F900ADBC2166FB13704D4014,2025-06-27 11:29:15,en,WEB,"  June 27 -- Nykaa's parent, FSN E-Commerce Ventures, is focusing more aggressively on fashion and plans to increase the vertical three to four times in the next five years. It is relying on high customer retention and margin expansion to fuel the push and estimates Nykaa Fashion to become EBITDA-positive as early as FY '26. In the last fiscal, the segment had an EBITDA margin of -8.3%. Revealing its strategy at its Annual Investors Day on Thursday, the company stated that it is aiming for a five-year steady-state EBITDA margin of 10% in the fashion business. Its house brand portfolio, House of Nykaa, meanwhile, is targeting a gross merchandise value (GMV) of Rs. 6,000 crore (US $ 701 million) by  '—expanding at a CAGR of 30% from its current Rs. 2,100 crore (US $ 245 million). Five of the House of Nykaa brands have already hit Rs. 100 crore (US $ 11.68 million) in GMV, and three of them are over Rs. 200 crore (US $ 23.37 million). Nykaa Fashion itself registered Rs. 3,800 crore (US $ 444 million) in GMV in FY '25. In order to increase fulfillment speed, Nykaa also announced the launch of NykaaNow, a fast delivery service guaranteeing order completion between 30 and 120 minutes across seven cities. At present, 80% of orders in 12 cities are fulfilled the same day or the next day, while 70% of those in 110 cities achieve the same target. The firm's overall GMV increased on a 42% CAGR basis over five years—over twice the 18–20% rate of the larger e-commerce industry. It has also grown to have more than 42 million customers, backed by an omnichannel network of 237 stores. Falguni Nayar, executive chairperson and CEO said that their beauty business has scaled 5X and fashion has surged 20X in the last five years—well ahead of the industry. She added that even in a cautious macro environment, they've continued to grow with focus and resilience, and beauty remains a growth engine, B2B is gaining traction, and fashion is regaining momentum. Nykaa also focused on the increasing power of Gen Z, who now control 44% of its cosmetics, personal care, and beauty spending. International luxury brands such as CHANEL, Kérastase, YSL, NARS, and Eucerin are also increasing their presence on the Nykaa platform."

韓國男神「臉蛋天才」車銀優抵達巴黎，出席入伍前最後一次聖羅蘭YSL 2026 春夏時裝大秀，有不少粉絲在酒店前等待車銀優，希望能夠得到他的簽名，然而意外突發成焦點！ 他原本打算利用空檔晨跑運動，怎料他衝出門外時，AirPods竟不慎從口袋掉出，直接被經過的轎車輾過，讓車銀優當場傻眼。 ▲▼車銀優帥氣現身YSL大秀讓現場鎂光燈閃不停。 （圖／翻攝自eunwo.o_c IG）
這段街頭小插曲被粉絲捕捉上傳到社群X，只見影片中可見他拾起AirPods，一臉茫然看著他的AirPods，場面既心疼又令人哭笑不得。 粉絲直呼：「天啊，這點小意外誰能避得過！」 網友也紛紛笑著安慰：「遇上另類意外！」 ▲車銀優趁空檔與凱旋門拍花絮照。 （圖／翻攝自X@ldm_330）

不過車銀優並未因此受影響，在巴黎聖羅蘭（Saint Laurent）春夏 2026 男裝秀，他以深秋款格紋襯衫、大衣搭配皮革褲亮相，完美演繹酷帥男模風，粉絲直呼「這畫面太 manhwa（韓漫）。」 這次巴黎亮相除了走秀，先前他也以即將入伍前感性IG 貼文做為告別，透露將於7月底加入韓國軍樂隊服役，事前還安排了告別粉絲會。 這次的巴黎之行格外意義非凡，不過這AirPods的損失可能是他難忘的「入伍前最後一週」回憶。 更多三立新聞網報導

mov_973EB4194F3A06654CB435A7FE5D3D76,2025-06-28 11:00:43,en,WEB,"  We know, we know, Paris Fashion Week is supposed to be about the clothes, but we spotted some downright fabulous timepieces on celebrities at two shows this week. Renaissance man Pharrell Williams showed off the new Richard Mille RM 74-02 on the Louis Vuitton runway on Tuesday, as he presented his spring/summer 2026 men's ready-to-wear collection. Actor Bradley Cooper, who is an LV ambassador and the face of the Tambour watch collection, rocked the new Tambour Taiko Spin Time Air Antipode at the show. The world timer was named in Robb Report's Best of the Best awards this year. At the Saint Laurent show, actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson flashed his glitzy gold Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra Shades, while fellow actor Rami Malek and singer-songwriter Giveon both wore different versions of the Cartier Tank Louis Cartier. There were some strong watch flexes stateside, too. John Cena rocked a Rolex Explorer II to the Heads of State premiere on Tuesday and newly minted Mavericks forward Cooper Flagg iced-out Hublot Big Bang. Below are the best watch flexes of the week. Giveon: Cartier Tank LC Giveon: Cartier Tank LC Giveon made a case for Saint Laurent and Cartier on Tuesday, pairing YSL threads with a stylish Tank Louis Cartier for the French fashion house's spring/summer 2026 menswear presentation. This modern riff on the 1917 Tank features an 18-karat yellow-gold case, a silver-grained dial with sword-shaped, blued-steel hands, and a brown alligator-skin strap with a gold buckle. The elegant piece costs $10,600—Saint Laurent clothes sold separately. Bradley Cooper: Louis Vuitton Tambour Taiko Spin Time Air Antipode Bradley Cooper: Louis Vuitton Tambour Taiko Spin Time Air Antipode Being the face of the Louis Vuitton Tambour, Bradley Cooper obviously had to pull out the coolest new version of the watch for the French maison's fashion show on Tuesday. Released at LVMH Watch Week in January, the new Tambour Taiko Spin Time Air Antipode reimagines the world timer by displaying two cities at each of the 12 hour indices, resulting in 24 antipodes (points located at exact opposite ends of the globe). At the center of the 42.5 mm white gold case lies the automatic Caliber LFT ST12.01 and a collection of floating city cubes that spin 90 degrees as the world timer is adjusted. It's no wonder the Antipode was named Best World Timer in Robb Report's Best of the Best awards this year. It'll set you back $99,500. Aaron Taylor-Johnson: Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra Shades Aaron Taylor-Johnson: Omega Seamaster Aqua Terra Shades Omega ambassador and James Bond candidate Aaron Taylor-Johnson swapped his Seamaster Diver 300M for a Seamaster Aqua Terra Shades for the Saint Laurent show on Tuesday. This glitzy model features a 38 mm case and bracelet in the watchmaker's signature 18-karat Moonshine Gold. The sun-brushed and lacquered dial is also gold, as are the faceted hands and boat-shaped hour markers. The glitzy number will cost you $37,200. Pharrell Williams: Richard Mille RM 74-02 Pharrell Williams: Richard Mille RM 74-02 Multihyphenate Pharrell Williams is continuing his tradition of wearing Richard Mille timepieces on the runway. The creative director for Louis Vuitton Men's sported an RM UP-01 Ferrari at his sophomore show for the maison in 2024 and an RM 74-02 at his spring/summer 2026 presentation on Tuesday. He could have worn the RM 52-05 he designed with the Swiss watchmaker, but that would have been far too predictable. Released only this past February, the RM 74-02 showcases an exclusive new Gold Quartz TPT that combines ultra-thin sheets of quartz with delicate leaves of 22-karat 5N red gold. More gold shines on the in-house automatic tourbillon movement. The CRMT5 Caliber can be fully appreciated through the openworked dial. The glitzy showstopper will set you back $603,000. Cooper Flagg: Hublot Big Bang Integrated Time Only Jewelry Cooper Flagg: Hublot Big Bang Integrated Time Only Jewelry Cooper Flagg wore a Hublot befitting of a rising star to the 79th NBA Draft on Wednesday. The Duke freshman, who went first overall to the Dallas Mavericks, showed off a dazzling diamond-encrusted Big Bang at the Barclays Center. If the original Big Bang that was released in 2005 was big and bold, this 2023 reference is bigger and bolder still. The 40 mm titanium timepiece is adorned with no less than 592 sparkling diamonds totaling 9.9 carats. Who needs fancy complications when you have all that bling? This bling isn't on the Hublot site, though, but it retails for $180,000. Rami Malek: Cartier Tank LC Rami Malek: Cartier Tank LC Rami Malek is the face of Cartier's new Tanks, so it isn't exactly surprising that the actor wears the iconic model on the reg. He rocked a Tank at the Golden Globes in 2019, the Oscars in 2022, and the Met Gala in 2023, for example. For the Saint Laurent show in Paris on Tuesday, the actor opted for a large . Priced at $3,650, this particular reference features a 33.7 mm steel case, a black lacquered dial with sword-shaped steel hands, a beaded crown set with a synthetic cabochon-shaped spinel, and a black leather strap...."

That might explain why hair and body mists, a lighter alternative to perfume, are exploding right now. “I find hair and body mists to be super versatile, they're fresh, light and easy to use,” says Chriselle Lim, Co-Owner and Creative Director of PHLUR. “They're the perfect way to add fragrance to your day without feeling too heavy or formal, and they're great for layering. There's also something playful and approachable about them. It's a little luxury that feels accessible, and I think that really resonates with people right now and reflects a broader shift towards embracing elevation and self-expression in our beauty routines.” No stranger to the trend, PHLUR has expanded their presence in the category. “Launching body mists felt like a natural next step for PHLUR as we're always thinking about ways to make fragrance more approachable and expanding the ways you can bring fragrance into different parts of your day,” Lim says. “With body mists, we wanted to give people more ways to express themselves through fragrance. Body mists are a lighter, more effortless way to enjoy scent, while still delivering the quality and complexity our customers expect from PHLUR. I personally love layering our body mists with our eau de parfums. I use the eau de parfum as a base on my pulse points and then apply the mist to my hair and clothes for a subtle, fresh layer. My favorite combo right now is PHLUR Beach Skin Hair & Body Mist and Missing Person Eau de Parfum.” So what exactly makes hair and body mists unique from perfumes? “The main difference is in the fragrance concentration,” Lim says. “Body mists are meant to be more subtle and light, and so carry a lower concentration of fragrance oil than eau de parfums. With our PHLUR Body Mists though, we actually formulate with a much higher fragrance load than is typical for body mists—it was important for us that our body mists have a stronger projection and last longer, so customers still get that bold, unexpected PHLUR scent experience.” Start spritzing with these top new hair and body mists. Phlur Peach Skin Hair & Body Fragrance Mist Imagine sipping a fresh, juicy mimosa al fresco while basking in the sun and you have this soft, sweet (but not too sweet), velvety scent. “We hadn't formulated a fruity gourmand in over a year, and I was craving a scent that captured a summer feeling but with a juicy, fruity twist,” Lim says. “I love that Peach Skin isn't a straightforward peach—it is fresh, juicy, velvety, like biting into a ripe peach, but it is layered with beautiful florals and a woody, creamy base that elevates the fragrance. I love to take a twist on nostalgic fragrances, and I feel like it's hard to get a peach scent that doesn't feel too juvenile. We worked tirelessly on Peach Skin and am so proud of what we created. It's sophisticated, yet flirty and entirely addictive.” Notes of peach are rounded out with plum, amber, bergamot, jasmine, vanilla orchid, milky sandalwood and coconut caramel. $38, phlur.com Josie Maran Bohemian Fig Fragrance Mist When clean beauty queen Josie Maran relaunched her brand last year to be more eco-friendly, she did so with new fragrances inspired by growing up in California. Now all four scents are available in fragrance mist format, made with 100% natural ingredients and designed to be super hydrating with argan oil and jojoba. Bohemian Fig feels like a night out in a tropical town with fig, vetiver and vanilla orchid. Layer them with her body products or wear them solo. $26, sephora.com Dior Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet Hair Mist When you really want to give your scent staying power, apply both a perfume and a mist. In this case, opt for the classic Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet Hair Mist, an alcohol-free hair perfume infused with rosewater to scent your locks in the gorgeous floral. After applying the eau de toilette to skin, spritz on the hair mist for a lasting trail. $82, dior.com Nest Santa Barbara Strawberry The sensation of warm summer afternoons is evoked with every spritz of this light and luminous body spray. To balance the scent of Santa Barbara strawberries, the fruity floral adds pink peony and solar woods. The formula contains baobab oil to give it nourishing staying power. $39, nestnewyork.com Heretic Dirty Mango Body and Hair Mist Who knew mango could be so sultry and spicy? Though most body mists tend to be perfect for day wear, this could easily work after dark too. Tropical and exotic, it mixes mango with mandarin and bergamot for a citrus touch, with a heart of black currant and a base of creamy musks and blonde woods. $36, NOYZ Salty Hair + Body Fragrance Mist..."

2026春夏米蘭男裝週名人一覽：
Dolce&Gabbana：丁海寅

18067336759884704,2025-07-01 19:10:49,en,INSTAGRAM,"  ✨ Review: ysl MYSLF Eau de Parfum ✨Just got my hands on the new YSL MYSLF and wow, I am absolutely blown away! This fragrance is amazing. From the moment I tested it, I was captivated. The main notes are a beautiful blend: it opens with a fresh and vibrant bergamot, leading into a heart of rich orange 🍊 blossom, and finally settling into a warm and sensual base of woods 🌲🌴 and patchouli. It's truly a modern masculine floral that feels both powerful and elegant. The sillage is fantastic, leaving a lovely trail, and the longevity is impressive – it lasts all day without needing a top-up! Another major benefit? It's a REFILLABLE spray ♻️ Love that YSL is stepping up with sustainable options. It's an investment that keeps on giving. You can find this incredible scent at #amazon, #superdrug, and #YSL directly. A huge thank you to superdrug for making this available! So happy with this purchase and looking forward to more amazing products from you! #SuperdrugFinds #YSLMYSLF #MYSLF #YvesSaintLaurent #NewFragrance #EaudeParfum #MensFragrance #PerfumeReview #ScentOfTheDay #FragranceLover #MustHave #RefillablePerfume #SustainableBeauty #LuxuryFragrance #FragranceCollection #BeautyReview #ScentAddict #FreshScent #WoodyFragrance #FloralNotes #SignatureScent #ModernMan #FragranceGoals #GiftIdeas #TreatYourself #InstaBeauty"

1lpb6ol,2025-07-01 19:37:04,en,REDDIT,"  So I'm a lurker here. This sub opened avenue of Decants for me and I'm so grateful for that , writing this review as a gesture to thank people who have helped me pull trigger on decants. Ordered this from whiff culture , delivered in 4 days so that's good I use to own full bottles before many hit and miss with likes of Nautica voyage, jaguar classic black , Versace eros ysl black opium etc etc Here mine 2 cents on this Khamrah Qahwa - too sweet , diabetic actually . This is more women leaning to me cuz of extra sweetness. Smells of nice toffee , apple pie , coffee to me. But It reacted badly with my odour and result was something very bad , nausetic i can say. Projects nice though and fills rooms. Fragrance are subjective and I won't reorder this. 7 / 10 9pm - my batch was weak actually , I apply this after work. This has some coconut smell in it in base notes , soothing and mellow. I don't care if it doesn't project or is beast mode. It is best suited for evening wear , applying this everyday after work. I get whiffs until late night. Will order full bottle and macerate it .8.5 / 10 Asad Boubon - bhai what is this juice. This is nuclear stuff. Short story i got 30 ml decant of this and end up applying more than I should. I got chronic headache had to visit doctor . It beast mode, compliments on day one. It has cacao note in drydown which is simply beautiful. Vanilla too which is awesome. But I won't order full bottle, it's toooooo loud, it's crazy. It don't want people to say hey this guy is walk in room freshner lol. I can handle eros edt loud but not this but yeah what a fragrance. 8.5 / 10, 10/ 10 for longevity and projection. Good job lattafa my next fav after black opium if I consider gourmand frags."

Every season, this list acts as a failsafe indicator of which collections have captured the attention of those who are more interested in the clothes than the front rows. As ever, the list is ordered according to the amount of views each collection logged on within its first 48 hours of publication. And as ever, this season has thrown up a few surprises. There are four new entries on the list this season, of which only one – Yves Saint Laurent – we expected to see. That reliably blockbuster show has been held outside of the mainstream menswear calendar for the last few seasons, and its in-season arrival on the Paris schedule made it an almost certainty to figure here. The three other new entries include the oldest designer on the list, the second youngest designer on the list, and the longest serving non-founder creative director in all of fashion. This season, eight of the top 10 collections were presented in Paris, with only two in Milan. That will be catnip to those who contend that Milan lacks “energy”. And only one of the collections on the list was not presented on the runway, which will cheer those who relish watching fashion theatre in its purest form. Two of the collections were debut shows for creative directors at well-established houses. And you needn't need to be a fashion clairvoyant to divine which show, this season, would be the most-viewed. Haute-bourgeois boys in leather pants plus the hottest bags in the business make Hermès an irresistible viewing pleasure for many among menswear's cognoscenti. So it's little surprise to see French luxury's most serene heritage marque sliding back into this season's top 10, making it the first of the list's new entries. And without wishing to spoil the reveal at the other end of this list, there is a satisfying symmetry to the fact that Véronique Nichanian is the longest-serving creative director in all of fashion (menswear included). Hermès SS26 Men's. Photo: Daniele Oberrauch/ Gorunway.com Second new entry Grace Wales Bonner is also the second youngest designer on this list. This season, she was presenting a collection that marked her 10th anniversary as one of the most precarious of entities in fashion: a London-based indie. In her review, my colleague Sarah Mower described as a “total disgrace” the fact that GWB has not yet been tapped to be creative director of another brand or house, and that reading is fair enough; however, another way of seeing it might be that Wales Bonner is simply too self-determined to let herself be pinned down. Her three-pronged combo of artistic practice, conscious menswear opulence and hit Adidas output seems to have generated a stable and self-sustaining business ecosystem that she's thriving in. Wales Bonner SS26 Men's. Photo: Filippo Fior/ Gorunway.com Sleazy elegance and watersports were the order of the day at an Owens show designed to lead its audience from the Palais de Tokyo venue to his not-dead-yet retrospective, 'Temple of Love', at the Palais Galliera across the road. Back in his happy-hustling LA heyday, Owens used to bounce from dive bar to dive bar; today, it's from Parisian palace to Parisian palace. What stops him from stumbling into the success-triggered trap of complete self-indulgence is a psychological safety rail built of self-awareness and humour. Dramatic, damp and wonderfully soundtracked (several days in advance, natch) this was another epic Rick. Rick Owens SS26 Men's. Photo: Courtesy of Owenscorp Those who love Dries Van Noten love Dries Van Noten, and his menswear stans are arguably the most passionate DVN fans of all. So even though Van Noten hand-picked Julian Klausner to succeed him as creative director of the brand, the stakes at this menswear debut were as high as that fanbase's expectations. Before the show, I spoke to a few bench buddies who were, like me, a little trepidatious on his behalf: last season's menswear lookbook (a sort of holding collection as Klausner warmed his seat) seemed rather a narrow vision of this most expansive of design visions. Cometh the hour, however, Klausner delivered: this was a dreamily Dries-ian collection, but it also felt tangibly distinct — a favourite dish in a long-favourite restaurant cooked by a freshly promoted and talented chef. Dries Van Noten SS26 Men's. Photo: Daniele Oberrauch/ Gorunway.com When we learnt that Giorgio Armani was sitting out this show — and the Emporio outing before it — after a passing illness that saw him briefly hospitalised, the story immediately flashed beyond the fashionsphere into the mainstream news media. That factor, plus the sheer enormity of this collection, might both have contributed to Mr Armani's return to the most-viewed menswear list this season. And yet, this designer — who at just shy of 91 years old remains the sole shareholder in a company he founded 50 years ago next month — more than merits the eyeballs. He is the singular author of his own utterly distinct dialect of fashion classicism, and despite his half-century of service, he continues to find variations on that dialect that are both surprising and subtle. Giorgio Armani SS26 Men's. Photo: Daniele Oberrauch/ Gorunway.com The Row is an amazing brand, and I highly enjoy its radically seated, chicly catered, no-phones runway shows during womenswear. But in my opinion, the inclusion in this list of a lookbook-delivered collection of which more than 60 per cent of the images (by my quick count) relate to womenswear resort rather than to menswear Spring/Summer 2026 is, at best, a margin call. Still, it's also our margin call. Its place here on behalf of a collection presentation at which the ever observant Amy Verner highlighted the Julian Schnabel clothing rack upon which a pyjama set was displayed, is a powerful testament to the enigmatic magnetism of a brand that is both discreet and discrete. The Row SS26 Men's. Photo: Courtesy of The Row Anthony Vaccarello's long-refined tailored Saint Laurent silhouette, a sort of angled figure eight, has evolved into a signature element in his nine years at the house. As Mower recounted in her review, Vaccarello applied variation to that theme this season. He was inspired by the palette of the late artist Larry Stanton and his gone-too-soon contemporaries, as well as the off-duty attire and aesthetic of the late house founder to present a collection alive with sophisticated colour combinations...."

mov_5CFDA27127C964CE81B3B7D30F69EFE6,2025-07-02 02:31:04,en,WEB,"  The power of a faux collar is unmatched. 1. Take yourself from bedtime ready to professional chic by layering a faux collar under a crewneck to look as if you've put on your official CEO uniform. Promising review: ""Love this collar, I wear crewnecks a lot and I wanted something to dress them up with. This def fits the bill!"" —Georgia W Get it from Amazon for $8.39+ (available in our colors and a two-pack). 2. Leave aerosol sprays and greasy roots in the past with I Dew Care dry shampoo. Just *tap, tap, tap* the little powderpuff where you need some oil control, and your 'do will look freshly-washed with the added perk of mega volume. Pro tip: Apply just a bit of product, brush it out, and repeat. Putting too much product at once may lead to a sheen of white residue. Promising review: ""I was looking for a dry shampoo that would be easy to use on the go for a trip I was taking. I had no issues taking this through TSA, and it was so easy to use on the go. You literally just pat the poof on your scalp and then rub the powder in. I do have black hair, so dry shampoo is usually very visible in my hair, but I didn't have any harder time than usual rubbing this powder in. It did a really good job of soaking up all the oil and giving my hair volume. I'm not a fan of the price for the amount that you get, but it is lasting longer than I thought it would. I would definitely recommend and will purchase again."" —Teresa Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in seven shades). 3. Upgrade your casual-just-getting-a-coffee wardrobe with an elevated cropped tank, one that has been blessed by a stylish fairy godmother. Why? This takes your basic cami and goes *poof. * Promising review: ""Don't hesitate, just buy it. I bought it in one color and as soon as I tried it on I purchased three more. The material is like butter. It doesn't have a built-in bra, but it's lined. You could put on a bra with this if you'd like but there's no need. It's cropped but still long enough that it doesn't roll up weirdly at the bottom. Can dress this up or down! I'll probably end up buying every color by the end of the year, it's just that incredible."" —Danijtate Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in women's sizes S–XXL and 31 colors). 4. Trade your pajamas for an equally comfy (and errand-appropriate) lounge set. This one is made with a cozy waffle-knit material, ironic considering you'll adore this two-piece just as much as the doughy, syrup-drenched breakfast dessert. Promising review: ""I really like the fabric of this one and it's perfect for fall and winter in Texas. I love being comfy and still looking somewhat put together in this."" —Lily McAninch Get it from Amazon for $45.99+ (available in women's sizes S–XL and in 17 colors). 5. Pair a plain tee with high-waisted palazzo trousers, pants guaranteed to make you feel ~trendier than thou~ while you strut to your corner deli. These are available in neutral and vibrant hues alike, making it look as if you didn't snooze through your alarm this morning. Promising review: ""These pants as so comfortable and flowy! I stepped outside of my usual skinny jean outfit to try this style and I never want to take them off! They are great casual pants for work, and can be dressed up for the evening with a fancy shirt and heels. They are as comfortable as pajamas, without looking like it :)"" —Nash..."

新生代男神曾敬驊、曹佑寧首度同框，今（2日）現身台北信義區，出席YSL《仲夏度假 VILLA》快閃店開幕記者會，兩人一登場就引發現場粉絲瘋狂。 YSL這次將潔白地中海與金色豔陽搬進市區，營造浪漫奢華的仲夏度假氛圍，並邀請兩位男神分享專屬香氛儀式、心動妝容與拍貼互動，現場帥度爆表。 ▲雖然第一次同台，但曹佑寧（右）和曾敬驊兩人默契十足。 （圖／記者王培驊攝影）
兩人雖是第一次公開同台，但私下早已認識，還會一起運動、用IG互相分享新作品。 曾敬驊開心透露：「我們會私下約吃飯，也會互傳上映消息。」 兩人還現場被問對方的最新電影作品，隨時考還是都默契十足的答對。 被問到即將出席北影頒獎典禮，曾敬驊笑說這次心情相當輕鬆：「有點像是家族旅遊，因為同劇的大家都會一起去，最重要的是希望大家上映後能多多支持這部戲。」 他回憶上週首次擔任金曲獎頒獎人時則坦言：「那是我最緊張的一次，第一次去小巨蛋、第一次進後台，覺得歌手的氣場都很強，當作是一次新的學習。」 ▲曾敬驊（左）、曹佑寧開心跟台下粉絲打招呼。 （圖／記者王培驊攝影）
曾敬驊笑說，自己其實很羨慕今天活動曹佑寧能穿無袖上陣：「夏天快到了，清新自由的香氛很重要，淡淡的不會太重的味道我最喜歡，尤其是柑橘類或橙花，女生夏天噴這類香水就很吸引人。」 他還大方推薦YSL自由不羈系列香氛搭配443號唇釉，覺得這個組合剛好適合喜歡清爽感的女生。 曹佑寧則分享，自己喜歡女生身上有花香味：「因為我自己喜歡聞這個味道。」 回憶過去運動員生活，他笑說：「夏天運動後難免有味道，有時候聞到都會想是不是自己，球隊的大家其實都會習慣噴香水，所以我們其實都很香。」 他也透露前陣子剛從日本旅行回來，吃了很多美食，近期則拍完一部恐怖題材電影，預計明年上映。 曹佑寧推薦YSL自由不羈系列香氛給女生，並建議搭配唇釉442號：「這顏色稍微重一點，約會的時候超適合，一眼就能看到。」 ▲▼YSL《仲夏度假 VILLA》快閃店。 （圖／記者王培驊攝影）

Prada
Prada 2026春夏男裝大秀於Prada藝術基金會之 Deposito內舉行，會場用花花地毯布置成簡單而夢幻的空間，本季聚焦「A CHANGE OF TONE態度的轉變」，兩位創意總監 Miuccia Prada 與 Raf Simons 希望轉換現實社會權力至上的風氣，嘗試用真誠、美好的事物回歸純粹。 當天與會嘉賓中的男士們一一以敞開的西裝造型亮相，博得粉絲們大大歡心，而最新2026春夏系列大量的小短褲Looks，更讓人期待下回會由哪位明星來駕馭呢？ Prada 2026春夏男裝系列從繽紛色彩，到單品的選擇如編織帽、拖鞋、短褲，都是非常夏日的畫面，同時也強調穿衣是從容自在的態度，在有些你可能不解為何這樣搭配的Looks裡，正是用「非典型和諧」來象徵自由。 Dolce&Gabbana
Dolce&Gabbana 2026春夏男裝系列主題定為「PAJAMAS BOY睡衣男孩」，經典的條紋睡衣成為設計主軸，輕盈棉料、皺皺質感、鬆緊抽繩⋯⋯都是回家後讓人想立刻換上的居家服特質！ 其中當然也少不了品牌的豹紋元素點綴，工藝則體現在閃閃發亮的寶石和水晶刺繡上。 Dolce&Gabbana本季的主題其實是想傳遞一個概念，那便是模糊居家與外出的界線，保持輕鬆自在的態度，睡衣也可以是很時髦的日常造型！ 在秀後，模特兒們更是直接穿著這些睡衣Looks走上街頭，呼應本季的訴求，這個精彩的環節馬上就形成話題！ Vivienne Westwood
這是繼2017年Vivienne Westwood首度在米蘭發表獨立男裝系列後，睽違8年的回歸舞台。 由Andreas Kronthaler主導的最新2026春夏男裝系列，我們看到男人們穿起高跟鞋（而且有些超級高！） 、連衣裙⋯⋯性別邊界已被模糊。 VivienneWestwood 2026春夏帶領觀眾回到文藝復興時期，當時英國貴族公子們嚮往到地中海「壯遊」，因此他們的風格受到了義式渲染。 而Andreas Kronthaler強調服裝不分性別，他便把花花公子的Dandy Style夏日風格，與老奶奶衣櫥中會有元素混合在一起，例如復古印花、軟軟材質的裙子、便鞋……每一套都令人眼睛發亮！ 「當一位男士擁有風格，這便足夠了。 風格與時尚無關，真正重要的是態度與品味的展現。」 PDF
來自米蘭的新銳品牌 PDF自創立以來就以顛覆傳統的風格備受矚目，2026春夏系列秀場佈置成一個監獄空間，鐵鍊、欄杆、反光鏡面裝置……瞬間拉開逃脫計畫的序幕，則猶如一場「越獄風雲」！ dunhill
創意總監Simon Holloway為dunhill 2026春夏系列提供了破格的上流社會著裝靈感，以玩世不恭的姿態演繹正裝風格，讓優雅紳士不再呆板，頂級英倫式剪裁輪廓中，運用大膽的色彩組合、加入運動氣息、瀟灑的著衣方式，來演繹這種衝突感美學，參與走秀的漂亮狗狗們也是一個可愛亮點，同時代表著一種貴族氣息的象徵。 延伸閱讀：

The service now provides access to over 90,000 fashion, beauty, and lifestyle products from more than 600 brands across the three major cities. According to the company, M-Now has seen significant spikes in demand during key moments. Orders jumped 4.5 times on Valentine's Day, with a 5x increase in new customer acquisitions.

Popular categories on M-Now include T-shirts, dresses, jeans, kurta sets, lipsticks, and perfumes. Featured brands include Levi's, MANGO, Tommy Hilfiger, Bobbi Brown, L'Oréal, and Prada. Recent additions to the lineup include Marks & Spencer, Snitch, Pantaloons, Decathlon, and YSL. Myntra stated that nearly half of its total orders across 600+ Indian cities are now fulfilled within 48 hours through its M-Express service. Building on that momentum, M-Now takes speed a step further by offering ultra-fast, intra-city delivery. With M-Now, the company is targeting both planned shopping and spontaneous purchases, positioning itself firmly within the growing quick commerce space for fashion and  lifestyle. #TheTatva #Tatva #Ad #Food #Medicine #Fashion #Clothes #India #Bengaluru #Delhi #Mumbai #Myntra #MNow #Viral #Explore"

1lq2g1h,2025-07-02 17:49:04,en,REDDIT,"  I need help! I'm looking for a new signature scent (or two or three) but with the economy being what it is, I simply can't justify high prices for colognes anymore. (Goodbye Tom Ford and MFK!) Also, I want a new cologne with noticeable sillage and of course longevity. Colognes I have enjoyed: - Viktor & Rolf - Spicebomb* - Le Labo - Another 13* - Maison Francis Kurkdijan - Gentle Fluidity - Tom Ford - Lost Cherry* - YSL - MYSLF - Jean Paul Gaultier - Le Male* - Paco Rabanne - 1 Million * These are colognes I have gotten compliments on over the years (and asked what cologne I'm wearing) Chat GPT says that based on this list, my preferences are: Primary type: Warm spicy sweet, with a strong gourmand backbone. Secondary type: Musky, slightly woody, smooth ambers — to avoid smelling like a pure dessert. You enjoy: Seductive, cozy, slightly playful scents that still feel confident and modern. You avoid: Overly aquatic, green, pure fresh, barbershop-style fougères. Your skin likely amplifies sweet and spicy notes in a way that smells inviting, rather than cloying — that's why you get compliments. You handle denser, heavier base notes well (tonka, amber, woods) without them turning sour or muddy.

I picked it up today for my gym scent and MANN does this stuff smell great, amongst all my ysl's (that I'm a big fan of) and other freshie fragrances, picking up Nautica was quite refreshing. I added it to my collection for the popularity and nostalgia early on in my fragrance journey, even though everyone talks bad on it (smell, projection, performance). I even gifted it to my brother after little to no use. I guess after months of not smelling it really made me miss it, took it back from him and actually got a good 6-7 hours out of it. I know this isn't news by any means but man, it makes me appreciate what I once belittled when it comes to my fragrances. Damn near feels like I got a whole new fragrance."

After the recent heatwave that pushed the French capital to its limits, summer temperatures finally seem to be settling in more gently. A perfect moment to discover the stunning visuals from the latest campaign imagined by Anthony Vaccarello — where the art of living under the sun meets the signature codes of the prestigious house of Saint Laurent. The Summer Saint Laurent Woman Bodies move freely, basking in the sun, adorned in summer pieces that enhance their natural allure. Sun-kissed skin tells the story of hours spent by the sea, each golden hue a memory etched in light. In summer, the Saint Laurent woman unveils her true beauty : lighthearted and radiant, her hair still salted from the ocean. She poses, plays, lounges effortlessly for hours, emerging from these idle days more beautiful than ever before.

1lr893b,2025-07-04 03:04:24,en,REDDIT,"  Hey everyone! Just wanted to take a moment to thank this amazing community, you've all helped me so much over the past few months. The passion, knowledge, and honest feedback here really guided me through my fragrance journey. In the last 4 months, I went all in tried over 150+ decants, visited a few local perfumeries, and explored and owned tons of perfume oils beyond what I'm sharing in this post. After a lot of research (and a bit of obsession), I ended up collecting these fragrances, and let's just say… it became quite the addiction! That said, I've decided to hit pause and not buy any more fragrances for the rest of the year (with one exception that might arrive in the next couple of days). I'll still be around and happy to help anyone here however I can. Thanks again for being such a great part of this journey! **Note**: I am not an expert , I trust my nose more than reviews, please do research or test fragrances before you buy, I am from Middle east / Asia English is not my native language, I apologize in advance for any mistakes i try to explain this in my words without using any AI or correction tool. I am reviewing all fragrances after giving them time to mature. From Top Left to Right: 1. **Icon by Dunhill**: Really Good citrusy, Aromatic and floral scent. A good alternative for those who don't like sweet or overly citrusy scents for summer. 2. **1 Million Prive:** The most complimented one on my list, absolutely amazing winter scent with sweet and tobacco notes; I failed to find anything that can beat that fragrance. 3. **1 Million Elixir:** Very sweet and creamy vanilla with colorful floral tones, especially on the dry down. Lasts a long time and projection is strong. **4. **   **Jasoor:** Clone of VUBIR Coral Fantasy Long Lasting with Good projection, Very Versatile for year-round wear except very hot evenings. **5. **   **Asad Bourbon:** Clone that covers VUBIR Intense, Most Wanted and Stronger with you. Smells cozy and rich. Feels confident and warm. **6. **   **Khamrah :** Amazing Scent, Sweet,  Warm , Cozy with Vanilla and amber. 7. **Khamrah Dukhan:** I tried Liquid Burn, and to my nose, it smells quite similar that same warm, spicy DNA. But Khamrah Dukhan was much cheaper, so I went for it. It's incredibly long-lasting and feels like a spicier, less sweet version of Khamrah. If the sweetness in the original Khamrah isn't your thing, this might be a better fit. Honestly, it's underrated and didn't get the recognition it deserves from early buyers or reviewers. This one needs more attention, it's a hidden gem. 8. **Alpine Homme Sport**: Clone of Allure Homme Sport, as a Sporty scent both last 4-5 hours, and it's enough for a sports session, very good gym scent. 9. **CDN Precieux:** Clone of Aventus Absolu with Twist, Great performance and quality scent better and smoother when compared with Supremacy CE but costs more and feel more expensive **10. ** **Mont Blanc Starwalker:** absolute masterpiece a good night time / bedtime scent. Calming and relaxing, Hyped for a reason very unique scent. **11. ** **Dunhill Desire for a man:** Apple, Citrus and Rose based scent, classic cheap summer scent suitable for any age. 12. **L'Homme by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of L'Homme Lacoste, long lasting, sweet, citrusy fresh scent. FD is a small local perfumery in my area. 13. **L'Homme Intense by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of Dior Homme Intense, Dior Homme intense clones were mostly sold out and its hard to get them in my country so i visited a local perfumery where they had this clone its using same french oils used by other clone houses. I tried it it was very long lasting so i bought the bottle, during testing it last 12+ hours on my skin. 14...."

tw_sl_1a7b4fe388f1cc2353b719ba899f3398,2025-07-04 11:02:06,en,WEB,"  The tale of the Kolhapuri isn't contemporary, its roots run deep in Indian artisanal history Amidst the ongoing Prada Kolhapuri row, the Italian luxury brand recently faced legal action for selling its Indian-inspired flat leather sandals for Rs 1.2 lakh a pair. They now face demands to ""pay back Indians"". NDTV speaks to industry expert and Kolhapuri footwear brand owner, Aparajita Toor, to trace the journey of Kolhapuris through the years. This summer's hottest sandals, after all, are the Kolhapuris. The History Of Kolhapuri Chappals Kolhapuri chappals go back to the 12th century Kolhapur in Maharashtra, where artisans painstakingly craft these open sandals out of leather. Both King Bijjala and his prime minister, Basavanna, have been credited with encouraging the production of these footwear pieces to support local artisans. In their nascent years, Kolhapuri chappals were known by a couple of different names, generally based on their village of origin, such as Kapashi, Paytaan, Kachkadi, Bakkalnali and Pukri. By the 18th century, Kolhapuri chappals had become popular, and became known by their present name. Today, Kolhapuris are world-famous for their unique design and intricate handwork, which involves vegetable-tanned leather, braiding techniques, unique designs, and exceptional craftsmanship. It's precisely these qualities that have led to Kolhapuris being included in the footwear lineup of global luxury brands such as Prada, YSL, and more. What's more, in 2019, the Kolhapuri chappal was granted a Geographical Indication (GI) tag, officially recognising its origin and unique characteristics. Is The Kolhapuri A 'Trend'? NDTV spoke to Aparajita Toor, who runs a Kolhapuri footwear label favoured by Bollywood celebrities, named after herself. It was Aparajita Toor's undying love for Kolhapuris that made her realise the inherent need for comfortable, expressive, and wearable footwear for women, leading to the inception of the Aprajita Toor brand, a label symbolic of India's rich cultural heritage. Aparajita tells NDTV about where, when and how the Kolhapuri 'trend' began, according to her. ""To call it a 'trend' almost feels limiting. The Kolhapuri isn't a passing style; it's a 12th-century heirloom craft, rooted in tradition, history, and generational skill. If anything, it was never out of fashion; it was simply waiting to be re-seen, re-styled, and re-celebrated,"" Toor tells NDTV. Aparajita says that the Kolhapuri silhouette is timeless, and that she knew it could walk further. ""The craft has always been here, quietly holding its ground through generations. What's changed is the lens. The recent spotlight isn't because the silhouette is new; it's because the narrative around it is finally shifting. People are beginning to ask the right questions: Why hasn't this heritage craft been given the credit it so deeply deserves? It's not a trend revival. It's a long-overdue recognition of legacy,"" says Toor. Pride, Patience, And Wisdom For every artisan who crafts a Kolhapuri chappal, it comes with patience, pride, and wisdom. ""For the artisans, every Kolhapuri is the fruit of labor, not just of hands, but of heart. It's crafted with deep patience, quiet pride, and generational wisdom. While the design may appear simple, it demands an extraordinary eye for detail and a steady hand trained in caution. Every stitch, every cut, every curve is intentional,"" says Aparajita Toor. She adds, ""It's not just footwear. It's legacy, shaped by those who've spent a lifetime perfecting what others may overlook. The Kolhapuri isn't just a sandal; it's a living legacy. A symbol of heritage, skill, and storytelling, passed down through generations of master artisans."" The Kolhapuri's moment on the global stage is a reflection of rich artistic lineage, says Toor. ""Its silhouette speaks of timeless design, while its making reflects the kind of craftsmanship that the world is only now beginning to truly value."" But the lack of credit is hurtful, of course. ""It's always exciting to see Indian crafts make it to international mood boards, but what's disheartening is when they're showcased without context. Borrowing art forms is part of global fashion's evolution, but not acknowledging their roots is where it becomes problematic. We've seen this pattern before, where rich, centuries-old crafts are reimagined by luxury houses without so much as a mention of their origin, legacy, or the hands that shaped them,"" says Aparajita. ""Kolhapuris carry the weight of heritage, of artisan communities, of regional identity. Showcasing them without the right narrative does a disservice to the very essence of what makes them iconic,"" adds the designer. ""We've seen this before, moments where Indian art and craft are borrowed, styled into seasonal collections, and then left behind until the next revival. But what's hopeful now is a growing consciousness, a shift from consumption to conversation, from appropriation to appreciation. Where is it headed? Hopefully, towards deeper storytelling, sustained recognition, and a place in fashion that isn't just seasonal, but sacred,"" Toor signs off. Prada Dragged To Court Over Kolhapuri Row..."

Louis Vuitton、Chanel、Dior、Cartier、Hermès、YSL、Givenchy……
有没有发现，它们几乎都来自——法国‼️
这些品牌，构成了魅力法兰西🇫🇷的标志。 👑 一切从“太阳王”路易十四开始…
法国的奢侈品文化并非偶然，而是从王权时代就被“刻进DNA”。 17世纪，路易十四一边打造凡尔赛宫🌟，一边成立了皇家制造厂，让镜子这种奢侈品开始国产化。 奢侈品从王公贵族的宫廷生活延伸至工艺品、香水、家具🪑与时装👗，奠定了法国“时尚与奢华”的国家品牌。 为什么法国能称霸奢侈品界？ 🧐
这不是偶然，是一场“国家级的精心策划”：
1⃣ 历史文化传承：早在路易十四时代，奢华就已渗透进法国文化
2⃣ 政府全力扶持：法国政府长期为奢侈时尚行业提供资金、打击假货、保护品牌
3⃣ 手工艺精神：传承工坊文化，注重细节与品质
4⃣本地化营销：如在中国市场，会推出中式节日限定款
5⃣ 营造稀缺性：通过限量发售、候补名单营造“买不到”的高端感
6⃣银幕上的加持与文化影响：从赫本到梦露，明星效应强化法国品牌影响力✨
7⃣高端生活方式打造：不只是衣服包包，更是一种“精致的生活方式”
🫅强大的奢侈品集团
就像美国有科技四巨头 GAFA（Google、Amazon、Facebook、Apple）
法国也有自己的奢侈品四巨头——KHOL：
▪️Kering开云集团：旗下有Gucci、YSL、Balenciaga、BV等。 ▪️Hermès爱马仕：独立但实力强劲，球最难买的品牌之一，以手工工艺闻名。 ▪️L'Oréal欧莱雅：美妆界的王者，旗下包含Lancôme、YSL Beauty、Kiehl's等
▪️LVMH路威酩轩：涵盖Louis Vuitton、Dior、Celine、Fendi等80+品品牌。 这些集团凭借并购➕品牌矩阵➕高端战略，牢牢掌控全球市场话语权。 法国奢侈品，是艺术、工艺、身份与文化的集合。 不是一只包，而是一个故事📖
不是一瓶香水，而是一段传承💫
所以当你买下那件“Made in France”的奢侈品时，
其实你也成了这段浪漫历史的见证者之一。 💬 你最爱的法国🇫🇷奢侈品牌是哪个？ 怎么看待法国在奢侈品界的地位？ 欢迎留言聊聊💬#法国留学diy #法国 #法国留学申请"

6月25日，分众传媒在公司28楼会议室召开2024年度股东大会。 这是阿甘第二次现场参会，公司照例的低调简朴（不请客不送礼 + 水一支书一本)，参会的股东及证券代表人数仅70人。 恰逢6月14日，分众与支付宝合作推动的基于NFC技术的“交互宝”刚刚上线，本次公司提前准备PPT介绍“交互宝”的具体功能和应用场景。 本文阿甘讲讲分众2024年度股东会“互动投”业务、股东问答等信息。 现场调研不易，请点赞转发收藏支持！ 一、“互动投”创新业务 
7月，分众将正式开启“互动投”创新业务。 “互动投”是将屏幕侧面增加一个黏贴式的独立NFC设备（支付宝收银机），支持手机碰一碰领券，把广告位转化为品效何以的交易和互动入口。 该设备可以黏贴在智能屏和框架侧面，具备独立供电和网络联接，实现对应服务项的远程更新。 当内置NFC功能的手机解锁屏幕 + 碰一碰设备时，手机屏幕会弹出互动红包页面。 互动红包页面内容包括：利益点承接区 + 分众广告曲 + 产品曝光区。 此外，分众整理出初步的9种应用方案，具体如下： 
方案1：碰一下支付红包，红包将自动收录到支付宝应用内。 方案2：碰一碰弹窗广告页面，点击后进入天猫淘宝APP的广告落地页。 可以帮助淘天APP在618等重大活动时进行拉新。 方案3：碰一碰弹窗品牌产品广告，点击后进入天猫淘宝APP内品牌落地页。 对于品牌大客户如云南白药，在分众屏上做品牌广告 + 在互动投上做爆款产品效果广告。 一次性完成品牌+效果广告投放。 方案4：碰一碰后领取到线下门店优惠券。 在线下门店消费时，用支付宝扫码支付实现优惠券的自动核销。 方案5：配送到家服务。 碰一碰进入饿了吗或淘宝闪购APP，物流下单后结算配送到家。 此外， 
会员拉新：促进用户入会加大优惠力度。 帮助品牌商扩展用户群 
留资获客：获取客户线索。 消费者留下联络方式后获得红包等。 帮助如车企/4S店获得高价格商品的目标消费者联系方式，方便销售跟进。 应用下载：碰一碰后，二次弹窗确认后下载APP进行安装。 创新互动：AR试装整合营销。 【阿甘分析】 
1、消费者覆盖角度，NFC智能手机基本实现主流人群覆盖 
根据2024年全球智能手机市场数据及NFC技术渗透率的相关报告，得益于移动支付（如支付宝“碰一下”功能）和智能交通应用的普及，2024年中国支持NFC功能的智能手机渗透率已达到90%+。 在全球市场，NFC技术在智能手机中的渗透率较高，尤其在中高端机型中几乎成为标配。 2024年全球智能手机出货量中，支持NFC功能的手机占比预计超过80%，主要品牌如苹果、三星、华为、小米等均全面搭载NFC功能。 因由于公交和线下支付场景支持NFC，大部分用户NFC功能属于开启状态。 2、支付宝“碰一碰支付”在2024年覆盖苹果手机 
苹果对NFC权限控制严格，第三方应用（如支付宝）无法直接调用NFC芯片完成支付（类似Apple Pay的“真NFC支付”）。 支付宝的“碰一碰”功能实际是通过读取NFC标签信息后，跳转至支付宝APP完成支付，属于“曲线救国”方案。 这个曲线救国方案的限制是：必须联网且需用户主动解锁手机，无法像Apple Pay一样在锁屏状态下直接支付。 因此，分众“互动投”方案，需要消费者解锁后再靠近设备。 对比原来扫“二维码”方案，操作有所简化且更自然，但具体效果仍待观察。 3、发券优惠功能必要，场景消费效果是关键 
在供应远大于需求的今天，买东西提前获得折扣券不是难事。 线上获取的途径更多。 对于“互动投”来说，智能屏内容打动恰好有需求的消费才是关键。 4、支付宝负责设备成本，分众做轻资产业务探索 
股东会透露，按照分众与支付宝达成的协议，支付宝承担100-200万台设备成本。 支付宝将在项目中投入7到10亿的资金。 此外淘宝推出一个亿的现金红包，以及几亿甚至到100亿的各种优惠券，提升消费者感知和互动习惯。 分众的投入更侧重在“品效广告结合”的模式探索和日常运营。 在客户广告方案上，在原有品牌广告方案上，增加效果广告方案。 阿甘认为：2025及时零售爆发下，作为线下流量入口的分众价值有所提升。 在业务窗口期，江总做了一笔好生意。 二、股东问答环节 
【东吴证券分析师】 
昨天看到支付宝公众号发了“互动投”文章。 市场对这个模式期待较大。 请江总分享此业务模式的思考和规划。 【江总】

Both Rodriguez and Cordeiro live extremely busy lives. However, the couple makes it a point to regularly spend quality time together. As Cordeiro was all set to head out for ""date night"" on Saturday evening, she showed off her stylish outfit on Instagram. She sported a mixed color dress paired with contrasting black heels. As her tags indicate, Cordeiro's dress was from popular fashion retailer FashionNova, while her heels were designed by renowned fashion brand YSL.

For Rodriguez, whose fitness levels had dropped since he hung up his boots, Cordeiro turned out to be the perfect person to help him out of his rut. With his girlfriend's guidance and support, A-Rod was able to shed 32 pounds.

In a video posted on Instagram, Cordeiro rappelled from the top of a 170-foot-tall building in her hometown of Windsor, Canada. As she goes on to mention in her caption, her act was dedicated to ""every person who has battled cancer."" ""I Stood 170 Feet Above The City, Not For The Thrill,"" she wrote. ""But For The Fight.For every person who's battled cancer. For every family who's felt the weight of it. For every name we whisper in memory, and every soul still fighting. ""I repelled off the CIBC Tower with purpose—and alongside this incredible community, we raised over $350K for the Windsor Cancer Centre Foundation."" The event, organized in collaboration with the Windsor Cancer Centre Foundation, was a resounding success, reportedly raising over $350,000. Feedback Why did you not like this content?

1lty23e,2025-07-07 16:03:21,en,REDDIT,"  Hey frag fam, 24M from Delhi here. I've been into fragrances for a while now, but most of what I know today is thanks to this amazing community. Whether it was going down rabbit holes on old threads or reading all the reviews and recommendations, I've learned so much — and I genuinely want to thank all the fellow fragheads here for helping me become a more cognoscenti person in this world of scent. I started out with just 2–3 designer bottles, and looking back now, I'm genuinely proud of how far I've come. From blindly wearing basic stuff to now appreciating note breakdowns, flankers, seasonal wear — it's been a fun and nerdy ride I used ChatGPT to help organize this post, but all opinions are mine. Here's my current designer starter pack – 15 fragrances, quick thoughts, and ratings: 1. YSL Y EDP – My all-time favourite. Clean, fresh, sweet, gets compliments without even trying. 10/10 2. 1 Million Lucky – Hazelnut and plum combo that's just addictive. Discontinued and that hurts. 9/10 3. Acqua Di Giò Profumo – Classy AF. Smells like a CEO went for a walk by the sea. 9/10 4. YSL MYSLF – At first I was like meh… but it grew on me. Fresh, musky, different. 8.5/10 5. Dior Homme Sport 2021 – Ginger kick with a clean drydown. Very easy to wear. 8.5/10 6. Armani Code Parfum – Softer, modern version of the OG. Perfect for close settings. 8.5/10 7. Acqua Di Giò Parfum (2024) – The newest one, and honestly pretty good. Fresh with depth. 8/10 8. 1 Million EDT – Loud, sweet, and still works when I want to stand out. Club or winter frag. 8/10 9. Terre d'Hermès EDT – Smells like grown-man confidence. Dirty orange + vetiver vibe. 8/10 10. Versace Dylan Blue – My safe pick when I don't know what to wear. Just works. 8/10 11. Afnan SNOI – Aventus vibes with darker, fruitier twist...."

mov_93AAAC404957914D1575440370731693,2025-07-07 20:21:01,en,WEB,"  ATLANTA, Ga. (Atlanta News First) - Atlanta rapper Young Thug's attorney has filed a motion Monday seeking to modify his famous client's sentencing. Brian Steel filed the motion in Fulton County Superior Court, a motion that seeks a hearing on his request to modify Young Thug's sentencing in Atlanta's trial of the 21st century. It is not known what the modifications will be. On May 9, 2022, Young Thug and 27 other suspected criminal gang members were arrested in Buckhead on several organized crime, weapons and drug-related charges. Fulton County prosecutors accused Jeffery Williams - Young Thug's real name - was the head of an organized criminal gang known as YSL, which they said stood for Young Slime Life. Defense attorneys maintained the crew was part of a legitimate non-criminal record label, known as Young Stoner Life. Young Thug himself was facing eight criminal counts under a federal law that was originally enacted to fight organized crime. He was also charged with possession of marijuana with intent to distribute, possession of codeine with intent to distribute, possession of cocaine, possession of a firearm and possession of a machine gun. In a trial that broke Georgia records for the longest jury selection and the longest criminal trial itself, Young Thug took a non-negotiated plea deal on Oct. 31, 2024, in which he was sentenced to 40 years, with five years to serve in jail. His sentence was commuted to the time he had already served behind bars, which led to his release from jail not long after taking the plea deal. Most recently, Steel was part of a so-called legal “dream team” that represented Sean “Diddy” Combs, who was found not guilty earlier this month on one count of racketeering conspiracy and two counts of sex trafficking by a Manhattan jury. But the jury did find Combs guilty on two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution, a violation of the Mann Act, which could still lead to prison time. The overall verdict is broadly considered a victory for Combs.

On Monday (July 7), the Atlanta rapper took to X to deliver a message for certain rappers that he deems snitches and suggested they make music for a different genre. “If u a rapper and u a rat,” he tweeted. “U gotta just go gospel twin.” And while there's no telling who he's referring to specifically, he commented on Kid Cudi taking the stand in the Diddy trial back in May, tweeting, “Dam cudi a rat lol,” before ultimately deleting the post. Then there's his relationship with frequent collaborator and labelmate Gunna who decided to take a plea deal early on during the lengthy YSL RICO trial and has subsequently been receiving shade from Thugger. Back in November 2024, the YSL label boss tweeted and deleted a post asking Gunna to “stop acting” like they're still cool and added. “I don't know you my guy.” This was a few months after his father showed Gunna some support by attending one of his shows in Atlanta during his Bittersweet Tour. Then a few months ago in April, during a GQ interview, Thugger was asked what their relationship is currently and gave a lukewarm response, telling the outlet simply, “I don't know.” He also commented on an Instagram post in May, “I mean… he said it must end lol,” pointing out that Gunna seemingly covered up his YSL tattoo in reference to a statement prosecutors read in the courtroom after Gunna took the deal. “I recognize, acknowledge and deeply regret that my talent and music indirectly furthered YSL the gang to the detriment of my community,” Gunna said in the statement. “YSL as a gang must end.”"

Filmed during the TFWA Asia Pacific Exhibition in Singapore (12-16 May), Abia speaks to The Moodie Davitt Report Brands Director Hannah Tan from the group's striking pavilion, which showcased its shoppertainment approach to beauty retail. According to Abia, this is driven by a major shift in shopper preferences with 47% of Gen Z and Millennial shoppers looking for immersive experiences when they travel. (Above and below) L'Oréal Travel Retail Asia Pacific Managing Director Jesús Abia (right) and The Moodie Davitt Report Brands Director Hannah Tan discuss how the beauty powerhouse is pioneering a new era of immersive, inclusive and sustainable shoppertainment experiences in travel retail L'Oréal's standout presence at the Singapore show showcased its commitment to embracing the Pentarchy ecosystem of partnerships. Spanning 510sq m, the experiential showcase featured three multi-sensory experiential lounges with touchpoints tailored for modern travellers. The space brought together 22 luxury beauty brands from the L'Oréal Travel Retail Asia Pacific portfolio, including Lancôme, YSL Beauty, SkinCeuticals, Prada Beauty, Aesop and Kérastase. In the compelling video interview, Abia outlines how the beauty powerhouse is responding to the changing dynamics of travel retail post-COVID, particularly the growing demand for experiential retail and sustainable products. (Above and below) L'Oréal shoppertainment experiences offer an elevated sense of service through personalised rituals and product recommendations as emphasised by the Lancôme Absolue facial at the TFWA Asia Pacific show He says, “The L'Oréal Pavilion is a real statement of how strongly we believe in the strategic value of this channel. It's also an opportunity to share our vision of shoppertainment and how we want to make airports places of excitement. “To do that, we need to reinvent the ecosystem of partnerships we have with our stakeholders. This is what we call Pentarchy. In our booth you can explore a variety of experiences that reflect what our vision of airport beauty retail can look like. “At the stand, we have a pampering experience with Lancôme Absolu for visitors with time to spare,” he adds. “At the entrance, there's a quick beauty fix – ideal for quick skincare or makeup touch-ups. We're also targeting men, which is why we've created a lifestyle and grooming area where travellers can enjoy a cocktail, get a haircut, listen to music and work.” Men are a big focus for the company in 2025. Pictured above is Abia experiencing the hydrafacial at the SkinCeuticals pop-up at Singapore Changi Airport. Below is the L'Oréal Paris Men Expert Lounge at the Singapore show which offered grooming services alongside fragrance-inspired cocktails. Click here for an exclusive interview with L'Oréal Travel Retail Chief Sustainability Officer Laurence Pardieu-Duthil about the #JoinTheRefillMovement campaign Abia highlights the group's recent experiential activations, such as the YSL Beauty Light Club and SkinCeuticals' first aesthetic skincare outpost in Changi as well as exclusive cross-category collaborations, such as Lancôme x Monopoly, as examples of shoppertainment-focused campaigns brought to life by Pentarchy partnerships. He says, “The market has radically changed. We're seeing more Gen Z, more Millennials and more travellers from emerging markets. But across all of them, there's one key trend: 47% are looking for immersive experiences when they travel. “We see this as a huge opportunity, particularly because our fundamentals are strong. Appetite for travel is stronger than ever, and the appetite for beauty remains equally strong. This is why L'Oréal Travel Retail is bringing all these new experiences to life.” Additionally, Abia discusses the group's ongoing sustainability efforts, including its recent #JoinTheRefillMovement campaign for World Refill Day (16 June). #JoinTheRefillMovement is the group's first global multi-brand, multi-category and multi-channel refill campaign. The initiative aimed to drive consumer adoption of refillable beauty products by positioning refills as a new beauty ritual and a meaningful step towards greater sustainability. Abia says, “74% of travellers say they are looking for sustainable offers. We believe this is a fantastic opportunity as our refills offer great value to our customers. By the end of this year, almost a third of our catalogue will offer refillable options, such as Kiehl's. It's good for the planet and good for consumers' pockets.” L'Oréal highlighted the 'Beauty Shopper-tainment of the Future' concept at the TFWA Asia Pacific Exhibition, where this interview was filmed. Click here for our full story on the experiential showcase. Offering a final message to the industry, Abia says: “We must always stay ahead of the game and continue to pioneer – something we've shown with our recent activations and collaborations. Second, partnership is key and we have talked a lot about Pentarchy, which is the future of partnerships in this channel. I believe we can keep working together, and not in silos, to create value in our ecosystem. “Finally, it's about people” he adds. “Travel retail is about unique people and we need to bring back this travel retail DNA that is about agility, an entrepreneurial mindset and a spirit of conquest.” ✈ Pioneering activations, Pentarchy partnerships and people are at the heart of L'Oréal's strategy, Abia says"

自 2021 年推出 LINE 禮物服務以來，於 2025 年達成 7,000 萬份禮物送出的里程碑。 過去一年 LINE 禮物業績年增 26%，且在重點節慶期間單日業績年增可高達 60%，成長動能高。 LINE 禮物亦發現除了節慶檔期外，日常關心禮物之訂單頻次出現顯著增長 40%。 此外，也發現用戶送禮品類逐漸變多，由此可見，用戶對 LINE 禮物的信賴感持續提升。 台灣送禮文化不只從線下送禮到線上，一份禮物從「義儀式感」、「禮節性」的傳統送禮場景逐漸轉化為一種親密關係中的「情感支撐」行為。 跨世代送禮趨勢大公開：20+ 到 60+ 全世代皆入坑
LINE 在台灣是主要的通訊軟體，14 年來連結用戶生活，透過 LINE 的社交圖譜，讓 LINE 禮物的使用率持續提升，數位送禮已然成為 LINE 用戶日常。 本次 LINE 禮物也深入挖掘 2025 年三大世代用戶的送禮行為，針對送禮習性，分為三大年齡世代：比粒、講究、璀璨世代進行送禮行為分析，全面揭示各族群的年增率表現、偏好選購的禮物品類，以及背後驅動送禮的情感與生活需求，勾勒出台灣送禮文化在不同世代間的樣貌演進：
 比粒（諧音 Busy）世代（20-39 歲）- 高頻次數位送禮之種子部隊，更重視與好友互相的情緒價值
此世代連續數年穩定帶動 LINE 禮物成長，送禮用戶數年增率維持在 15–20% 之間。 過去一年裡發現該年齡族群的買家，高頻使用者顯著提升之外，跨品類選擇更多不同種類禮物的買家數年增超過兩成；尤其以美食禮物為大宗，其次為居家生活；正面顯示比粒世代對於「生活質感」與「情緒價值」的高度重視。 此外，保健食品的禮物選擇也有顯著提升，顯示年輕用戶已開始在社群互動中關注健康，讓 LINE 禮物成為關心彼此身體的日常工具。  講究世代（40-59 歲）- 過去一年成長最多之客群，講究質感與客製化選品的穩定主力
講究世代是近一年成長最快的族群，年增率突破 30%。 去（2024）年推出的客製刻印、自選規格與個人化推薦等升級服務，其品質與更體面的設計，深受該世代的用戶青睞。 另外同年上線的信用卡支付服務大幅提升了該年齡層的使用率。 根據平台數據表示，講究世代用戶每個月都會至少送出一個禮物的用戶數年增 40%，顯示該年齡層用戶對於 LINE 禮物的高黏著度。 講究世代更重視生活實用性，較突出的送禮選擇為飾品包錶、甜點烘焙與茶飲咖啡。  璀璨世代（60-70 歲以上）-時尚新勢力，熱衷送出美妝香氛禮品
璀璨世代在 2024 年被譽為 LINE 禮物的「輕奢時尚元年」，送禮用戶數年增率首度突破 20%，展現出驚人的成長潛力。 這一向被認為較少涉足線上送禮的年齡層，意外地對底妝彩妝、香水香氛等「輕奢」品類展現出極高的接受度，成為時尚送禮新勢力的代表。 隨著越來越多國際精品品牌如 PRADA Beauty 等國際知名品牌與 LINE 禮物的獨家合作，璀璨世代嘗試更多送禮選擇，年齡不再是追求風格與品味的限制。 「有我在」送禮「新五感」：五大關鍵成長禮物品類趨勢
不同世代對送禮的態度與品味逐漸趨向一致，呈現「講究、貼心、剛剛好」，LINE 禮物也進一步觀察到，四年來，禮物的意義已從單純的心意象徵逐漸轉變為實際生活支援，陪伴收禮者度過每次心情起伏。 為此，LINE 禮物更整理出五種關鍵成長的禮物品類趨勢，讓消費者可以在對的情境送對禮物：
 「剛剛好的能量禮」- 行動能量包：隨著 LINE 用戶互動頻繁，用戶開始在工作日、加班夜、考試季等時刻「臨時想送一點什麼」，便利、實用的票券型禮物快速滲透日常對話場景，「即時慰問」與「能量補給」型禮物隨之大爆發。  「剛剛好的甜點禮」- 吃甜一點，撐過今天：台灣人愛送「甜食」已經從節慶延伸到日常，每一種情緒，都值得來一口甜點。 小巧又能快速寄送的甜點成為「情緒補給站」，尤其是中價位精緻品項如可麗露、磅蛋糕持續熱賣，甜點慰勞已成為人們的社交潤滑劑
 「剛剛好的香氛禮」- 聞得出的關心：香氛類商品不再只是自用選擇，而是被當成一種「療癒情緒」、「表達關心」的高感度禮物，適合送給情緒疲憊、工作壓力大的朋友。 特別是中性香味與擴香石，因不挑人也不過度私人，成為「剛剛好」的安心選擇。 香味也就成為人們情緒轉換的禮物語言
 「剛剛好的紀念禮」- 不說我愛你，但你知道我很重視：儘管日常送禮增加，但部分族群（如親密關係）仍偏好具有「紀念感、收藏感」的禮物，如彩妝禮盒、身體保養、香水、金飾、餐酒具等，這類品項代表了一種「更有份量的心意」，可以看出精緻商品崛起。  「剛剛好的娛樂禮」- 五感慰勞派：年輕族群偏好能帶來「短暫快樂」的娛樂禮物，如影音點數、遊戲點數、Buffet 吃到飽票券；而生活系禮物則聚焦在「微升級」的日常體驗，如早餐麵包、冷凍美食、泡芙等，「宅生活升級品」儼然成為新主力。 LINE 好友日常互動：把禮物放進 LINE 對話裡是最「剛剛好」的表達方式
為慶祝上線四週年，LINE 禮物特別推出四大關係互動情境影片，將聊天室的對話場景以線下真人演出趣味還原出這些時刻「有禮物的話」產生的「禮物讓人際關係質變」具體展現。 展示不同情境下的關係連結與送禮模式，並精心挑選出最適合的禮物，讓遇到不同人際需求的用戶都能「剛剛好」地傳遞彼此的心意。 除此之外，LINE 禮物也分別與 7-ELEVEN、酷聖石、麥當勞、王品集團、必勝客、與星巴克等 6 大品牌攜手合作，推出「天天主題日」活動，即日起至 7 月 31 日，每天只要完成品牌指定商品送禮，即可享有不同品牌的優惠折扣或折價券。 （詳細優惠資訊可參考附件之活動商品清單）
 好友篇（連結）：聚會遲到、朋友間遇到小摩擦？ 送出 LINE 禮物表達歉意、快速化解尷尬。 適合送：冰品、飲品等。  同事篇（連結）：同事神隊友幫襯，立馬回送禮物表示感謝。 適合送：咖啡，飲品券等。  情人篇（連結）：不讓女或男友森氣氣，禮物就是緩和彼此情緒時的利器。 適合送：美妝保養香水香氛、甜點等。  家族篇（連結）：關心孩子們大學期末考，送點心意祝福他們都歐趴；或是希望家人多呵護自己，在照顧別人的同時也懂得適時休息。 適合送：甜點美食茶飲。 閱讀更多「3C 部落客-林小旭」近期文章 口袋裡的蔡司精巧旗艦！ vivo X200 FE 輕旗艦 AI 手機開箱評測"

mov_75C0A34D0ECAB65E341C59E4CA0B5F7E,2025-07-08 22:26:51,en,WEB,"  Young Thug and Gunna have been named in a 56-count indictment with at least 28 other YSL members that include RICO charges, murder, gang activity and more. According to a report WSBTV's Michael Seiden in Atlanta posted on Monday night, May 9, Young Thug was arrested and booked at the Fulton County Jail. He's being held on charges of conspiracy to violate the racketeer influenced and corrupt organizations act (RICO) and participation in criminal street gang activity. A photo of Young Thug being arrested as well as the rapper's mugshot has also surfaced. He will have his first court appearance on Tuesday at 11:30 a.m. According to the 88-page indictment, Young Thug, born Jeffery Lamar Williams, reportedly stands accused of renting a 2014 Infiniti Q50 Sedan from Hertz, which was used to carry out the murder of Donovan Thomas, Jr., who is a rival gang member, back on January 10, 2015. The rapper also is reportedly accused of giving YSL associates Christian Eppinger and Antonio Sumlin the green light to pull off a second attempt at murdering rapper YFN Lucci while he's in Fulton County Jail. Meanwhile, Gunna, born Sergio Giavanni Kitchens, is reportedly facing one count of conspiracy to violate RICO. Gunna stands accused of appearing in a music video for Lil Keed's 2020 song “Fox 5"" while wearing a “YSL” pendant and a “Slatt” pendant. As far as the other members, prosecutors allege that “YSL is a criminal street gang that started in late 2012 in the Cleveland Avenue area of ATL. YSL claims affiliation with the national Bloods gang.” The rest of indictment includes murder and armed robbery charges in addition to the RICO charges. So far, Gunna has not been booked at Fulton County Jail. This story is still developing."

We've all been on the fitness tracker train for a while, using them to supercharge our sleep, track our cycles and monitor our stress. But when I learned of the Oura Ring, ridding me of the bulky watch-style band that spoils my seamless summer tan, I was sold. The wearable health monitor, the first model of which was launched all the way back in 2015, is designed to 'paint a truly holistic picture of your health' by monitoring your sleep, activity, stress, heart health, and hormonal cycle 24/7, before providing personalised insights and recommendations. The fact that it leans into the chunky jewellery trend, while also mimicking the classic wedding band? An added bonus, enjoyed by celebs including Kim Kardashian, Gwyneth Paltrow, Jennifer Aniston and Mark Zuckerberg. Even better news: thanks to the return of the Amazon Prime Day sale, all Oura Ring 4 finishes are now 15% off for Amazon Prime members. SKIP TO: Everything you need to know about the Oura Ring 4 What are the differences between the Oura Ring Gen3 and the Oura Ring 4? How we test the Oura Ring 4 Oura Ring 4: The Verdict More Oura Ring savings in the Amazon Prime Day sale Everything you need to know about the Oura Ring 4: In the boxOne size-specific charger and a USB-C cable.MaterialNon-allergenic titanium.Width7.90mm.Weight3.3 to 5.2 grams, depending on ring size.Water resistantUp to 100m/328 ft.Battery lifeUp to 8 days of battery, and typically charges in 20 to 80 minutes.ConnectivityBluetooth Low Energy. iOS and Android compatible. Arguably, the Oura Ring is one of the most sophisticated wellbeing monitors to date, measuring more than 20 biometrics that all directly impact how you feel, including heart rate variability (HRV), blood oxygen levels and temperature. For those concerned about accuracy, the finger actually provides the most accurate reading of your heart rate, blood oxygen levels and temperature. Plus, the brand's ongoing testing has measured the device to have a 79% sleep tracking accuracy, compared to clinical polysomnography at 83%. Need a tad more convincing? It also reported a 98% heart rate variability accuracy when compared to ECG2. Wondering how exactly it measures those metrics, though? Through a quartet of monitors: Red and infrared LEDsMeasure blood oxygen levels while you sleep.Green and infrared LEDsAlternate to measure heart rate and heart rate variability 24/7 and respiration rate during your sleep.Digital sensorMeasures your temperature variations.AccelerometerTracks movement and activity 24/7. But because a load of numbers and percentages aren't hugely helpful to those without a doctorate, it then shares its findings via the clear and concise Oura app in easy-to-digest graphics tables. This does mean you will need to sign up for an Oura Ring membership, but for just £5.99 a month or £69.99 a year, you'll also get tailored recommendations on how to up your scores. What are the differences between the Oura Ring Gen3 and the Oura Ring 4? First, the design and material. While the previous model had a titanium exterior surrounding an epoxy interior, the new iteration is made from lightweight, durable titanium the entire way through. The latter also comes fitted with recessed sensors, aiding a more comfortable fit and improved tracking. Talking of, the accuracy of the Oura Ring 4 is powered by Smart Sensing that dynamically selects the optimal signal path. In terms of battery life, designers claimed the Gen3 could last a whole seven days, while you now get up to eight days of uninterrupted tracking per charge with the 4. How we test the Oura Ring 4: Georgia Trodd wearing the Oura Ring 4 in gold. It's no secret that GLAMOUR editors often moonlight as testing guinea pigs. Over 12 weeks, various team members were asked to call into question the many claims made by the Oura Ring design team and consider the following: Ease of use — Was the app intuitive to use, and were your results easy to understand? Design — Did the ring feel big, bulky, heavy or get in the way? Any signs of wear and tear after 12 weeks? Waterproof — Any issues when worn in the bath, shower or while getting sweaty in the gym? Effectiveness — Did the personalised insights and recommendations make a difference to your health and/or wellbeing? Oura Ring 4: The Verdict We're still very much in the honeymoon period of our health tracking — AKA Oura needs a few more weeks of data to properly notice any patterns. However, our team of testers have pulled together a list of perks so far. There were no complaints in terms of comfort, many commenting how they forgot they were even wearing it, most days. And the response was the same when it came to design — many complimented how seamlessly it sat alongside their jewellery. One did point out that the gold is a little more yellow than most gold-plated bracelets and rings on the high street, but this is barely noticeable from a distance. ProsConsBattery lasts up to eight days, depending on activity level, and recharges super quickly in under two hours.There can be some tracking teething issues in those first few months — for example, mis-reading drying your hair as a workout.Offers you trends over time, giving you daily, weekly and monthly calendar views of your key body metrics.Rest Mode automatically switches on when Oura detects that your body might be under stress.Super aesthetic and plenty of colour options.

[CMN 특별취재팀] 대한화장품산업연구원은 최근 발간한 글로벌 코스메틱 포커스 4호 인도, 인도네시아편에서 “(K-뷰티는) 마케팅 측면에서 현지화 전략을 통해 현지 소비자에게 친숙함을 어필하는 것이 필요하다”고 강조했다.
K-뷰티는 인도 소비자들 사이에서 여전히 트렌디하고 선망의 대상으로 인식되고 있다. 뚜렷한 포인트 메이크업을 선호하던 트렌드가 투명하고 맑은 피부 표현, 은은한 블러셔, 연한 컨투어링 등 자연스러운 한국식 메이크업으로 이동했다.
기미나 잡티 없이 유리처럼 맑고 매끄러운 피부를 연상시키는 한국식 스킨케어도 인기다. 얼굴, 모발, 입술 등 전반적인 피부관리에 한국산 화장품을 선호하는 추세다.
이처럼 K-뷰티의 영향력은 여전하지만 인도 로컬 브랜드들은 소비자들의 수요에 기반한 제품을 개발하고, 유통 채널을 다변화하면서 시장의 주도권을 강화하고 있다. 인도 정부도 신규 브랜드 프로그램과 같은 다양한 지원 사업을 통해 현지 화장품 산업 성장을 뒷받침하고 있다.
K-뷰티, 인도 주류 트렌드로 부상
K-뷰티의 글로벌 확산에 따라 인도에서도 그 영향력은 뚜렷하게 감지되고 있다. 과거 인도 뷰티 시장은 윤곽 강조, 도톰한 입술, 각진 눈썹과 같은 뚜렷한 포인트 메이크업 중심의 서구 스타일이 주를 이뤘다.
그러나 최근에는 K-뷰티 특유의 투명하고 맑은 피부 표현, 은은한 블러셔, 연한 컨투어링 등 자연스러운 메이크업으로 미적 기준이 이동하고 있다.
K-뷰티는 스킨케어 방법에도 영향을 미쳤다. 한국 뷰티의 핵심인 레이어링(Layering) 개념이 인도 소비자들 사이에서 확산돼 예전보다 더 많은 단계의 스킨케어 루틴이 일상화됐고, 이로 인해 인도 시장에서 화장품의 사용량과 카테고리 자체가 확대됐다. 이와 같은 변화는 단지 한국 화장품의 인기 상승에 그치지 않고 현지 기업들의 제품 개발, 브랜드 및 유통업체의 마케팅 전략에도 영향을 미치고 있다.
인도 배우 카리나 카푸어 칸(Kareena Kapoor Khan)과 슈가 코스메틱스(Sugar Cosmetics)의 공동 창업자 비네타 싱(Vineeta Singh)이 함께 론칭한 K-뷰티 콘셉트 기반의 스킨케어 브랜드 퀜치 보타닉스(Quench Botanics)가 대표적인 사례다. 이 브랜드는 메이드 인 코리아를 전면에 내세우며 쌀뜨물, 유자, 대나무 등 한국산 자연 유래 성분을 활용한 제품을 한국에서 생산해 인도에서 판매하고 있다.
나이카는 지난 4월 25일부터 27일까지 아모레퍼시픽 데이를 개최해 라네즈, 이니스프리, 에뛰드 등의 대규모 마케팅 캠페인을 전개했고, 인도 뷰티 플랫폼 카인드라이프(Kindlife)는 올해 자국 내 뷰티 트렌드를 반영하기 위해 K-뷰티 브랜드 유치에 본격적으로 나설 것이라고 밝히기도 했다.
럭셔리 뷰티 제품 수요 급증
커니(Kerney)의 2024년 9월 리포트에 따르면, 인도 럭셔리 뷰티 시장은 아직 초기 단계에 머물러 있어 구조적 성장 여력이 크다. 전체 뷰티 시장에서 럭셔리 제품이 차지하는 비중은 불과 4%로 태국, 베트남, 말레이시아와 같은 아시아 개발도상국의 20~25% 점유율에 비해서도 현저히 낮은 수준이다.
하지만 최근 인도의 럭셔리 뷰티 부문이 대중적인 뷰티 시장보다 두 배 빠른 속도로 성장하고 있으며, 미래 전망도 밝다.
글로벌 럭셔리 뷰티 브랜드들은 인도를 차세대 성장 동력으로 주목하며 적극적인 시장 공략에 나서고 있다. 이러한 흐름은 이미 수년 전부터 이어져 왔지만, 2025년에는 보다 구체적이고 전략적인 진출 사례들이 잇따라 등장하고 있다.
프랑스 명품 브랜드 샤넬(Chanel)은 2025년 5월 기준 총 7개의 부티크 매장을 운영하고 있으며 인도 내 입지를 강화하기 위해 뷰티 플랫폼 나이카(Nykaa)와 파트너십을 체결했다. 2025년 말까지 인도 전역에 위치한 10개 이상의 오프라인 매장으로 유통망을 확대할 계획이다.
일본 시세이도 그룹의 메이크업 브랜드 나스(NARS)도 2025년 나이카를 통해 인도 온라인 뷰티 시장에 공식 진출했다.
입생로랑(YSL)도 2024년 7월에 나이카를 통해 인도에 첫 진출했으며, 같은 해 11월에는 남인도 내 첫 오프라인 매장을 개점했다.
인도 소매업체 릴라이언스 리테일(Reliance Retail)의 옴니채널 뷰티 전문점 티라(Tira)는 인도 럭셔리 뷰티 시장을 본격적으로 공략해 2024년 11월 뭄바이(Mumbai)에 위치한 최고급 쇼핑몰 지오 월드 플라자(Jio World Plaza)에 플래그십 매장을 오픈했다.
위조 및 유해 화장품 단속 강화
불법 화장품 문제에 대응하기 위해 인도 당국은 2023년부터 '사운다라야(Soundarya) 작전'이라는 이름으로 대규모 단속을 진행해왔다.
이 과정에서 라끄메(Lakme), 로레알(L'Oral), 후다 뷰티(Huda Beauty), 메이블린(Meybelin)을 모방한 위조품이 적발된 적 있다.
인도 정부는 2025년에도 인도 전 지역에서 불법 화장품 유통에 대한 대대적인 수사와 단속을 진행했다.
2025년 1월 인도 서부 최남단 해안에 위치한 케랄라(Kerala)주에서는 70만 루피(한화 약 1,120만 원) 규모의 유해 화장품이 적발됐다. 이번 단속으로 33개 업체가 적발돼 법적 조치가 진행 중이다. 압수된 립스틱과 페이셜 크림 샘플에서는 수은 함유량이 법정 기준치보다 최대 1만 2,000배 높게 검출되는 충격적인 결과가 나타났다.
지난 3월 말에는 인도 국세청 산하 조세 정보국(DRI)이 해외에서 밀반입된 중국발 대규모 위조 화장품 컨테이너를 적발했다. 내용물이 신고 품목과 전혀 다른 가짜 화장품으로 확인됐다.
위인도표준국(BIS)은 2025년 3월 델리에 위치한 글로벌 유통업제조 및 불량 화장품 단속의 일환으로, 2025년 3월에 아마존(Amazon)과 현지 대형 전자상거래 플랫폼 플립카트(Flipkart)의 창고를 급습해 각각 8만 1,561달러(한화 약 1억 1,205만 원)와 7,000달러(한화 약 962만 원) 상당의 품질 기준 미달 상품을 압수했다.
이에 따라 정품 유통망 식별을 위해 전자로고(e-log)를 도입한 샤넬의 디지털 기반 위조 방지 시스템 강화 사례처럼, 뷰티 브랜드들은 각자의 방법으로 대응에 나서고 있다.
로컬 뷰티 브랜드 생태계 확장
인도 화장품 시장은 경쟁력 있는 로컬 브랜드들이 두각을 나타내며 새로운 성장 국면을 맞이하는 모습이다. 실제 소비자들의 수요에 밀착한 제품 개발과 유통채널 다변화를 통해 인도 토종 브랜드들이 화장품 시장의 주도권을 확장하고 있다.
2004년 설립된 컬러바(Colorbar)는 2025년 5월 기준 100개 이상의 직영 매장과 쇼퍼스 스톱(Shoppers Stop), 라이프스타일(Lifestyle) 등의 주요 소매점을 통해 1,200개 이상의 매장에 입점해 있다. 2025년까지 수익을 두 배로 늘려 100억 루피(약 1,400억 원) 이상을 달성할 것으로 전망하며, 2027년 초 기업공개(IPO)를 계획 중이다.
대표적인 인도 뷰티 브랜드 라끄메(Lakm)는 인구 구조와 소비 트렌드 변화에 대응해 '미니스(Minis)'라 불리는 소형 패키지 제품군에 주력하고 있다. 소용량 제품은 합리적인 가격, 휴대 편의성, 저렴한 가격으로 다양한 체험을 할 수 있기 때문에 Z세대 소비자층에서 강한 지지를 얻고 있다.
인도는 전체 인구의 약 65%가 35세 이하로 젊은층의 비중이 압도적인 국가인 만큼, 다양한 제품을 부담없이 시도하고 싶어하는 젊은 소비자층을 타깃으로 삼았다.
인도 메이크업 브랜드 매트룩 코스메틱(Mattlook Cosmetics) 또한 디지털 네이티브 세대를 공략하고 있다.
2025년 2월부터 퀵커머스 플랫폼 스위기 인스타마트(Swiggy Instamart)와의 제휴를 통해 10분 이내에 메이크업 제품을 배송해주는 혁신적인 배송 서비스를 제공하며 옴니채널을 구축했다.
지난 3월, 에스티로더 컴퍼니즈(ELC)는 인도상공업부(Ministry of Commerce and Industry)와 정부 주도 창업 지원 플랫폼 스타트업 인디아(Startup India)와 양해각서(MOU)를 체결했다.
뷰티앤유 인디아(BEAUTY&YOU India) 프로그램을 통해 현지 유망 스타트업을 발굴 및 지원할 예정이다.
인기 스킨케어 제품 분석
2025년 2월 3주차부터 5월 1주차까지 인도 아마존의 스킨케어 상위 10개 인기 제품을 분석한 결과, 클렌징 제품과 선케어 제품의 강세가 두드러졌다.
특히, 선케어 제품의 경우, 2월 3주차에는 3개, 5월 1주차에는 4개가 순위권에 올라 자외선 차단에 대한 인도 소비자들의 지속적인 관심을 확인할 수 있다.
5월 1주차에는 청량감과 쿨링 효과를 강조한 여름철 특화 선케어 제품이 새롭게 순위에 등장하면서, 계절 변화에 민감하게 반응하는 소비 트렌드를 보여줬다.
국가별 브랜드 분포를 살펴보면, 2025년 2월 3주차와 5월 1주차 Top 10 중 각각 7개, 6개를 인도 브랜드가 차지해 자국 브랜드에 대한 인도 소비자들의 신뢰가 돋보인다.
또한, 스위스 브랜드 세타필, 영국 브랜드 심플과 데톨이 6주 간의 분석 기간 내내 10위권을 유지해 특정 글로벌 브랜드에 대한 인도 소비자들의 선호도가 꾸준함을 입증했다.
비누 1위, 가르 솝 매직 솝
가르 솝(Ghar Soap)은 2019년 의붓형제인 라지브 쿠마르(Rajeev Kumar)와 로힛 쿠마르(Rohit Kumar)가 인도에서 창업한 스킨케어 브랜드다.
천연 비누에 담긴 철학과 비전을 진정성있게 전닿하며 대중의 마음을 사로잡았고, 그 후 브랜드 인지도와 매출이 가파르게 상승하며 인도에서 클린뷰티를 대표하는 스킨케어 브랜드로 자리잡았다.
가르 솝의 매직 솝은 샤프론, 샌달우드, 코코넛 오일 등 엄선한 자연유래 성분만 담았고, 제조과정은 100% 수작업으로 이뤄진다. 동물실험을 하지 않는 윤리적인 철학으로 소비자의 신뢰를 얻고 있다.
인도 소비자들의 후기를 분석한 결과, 대부분 일주일 이내에 피부 톤 개선을 체험했다는 평이 많았다.
인기 메이크업 제품 분석
2025년 2월 3주차부터 5월 1주차까지 인도 아마존의 메이크업 상위 10개 인기 제품을 분석한 결과, 립 메이크업과 아이라이너가 강세를 보였다.
특히, 메이블린의 아이라이너와 매트 립 시리즈는 6주 간의 분석 기간 내내 상위권을 유지해 지속력이 좋고 매트한 마무리감을 가진 제품들에 대한 소비자 선호도가 높음을 입증했다.
또한, 2월 3주차에는 파운데이션과 스트롭 크림이 순위에 포함된 반면, 5월 1주차에는 파우더 제품의 순위가 상승하는 등 계절에 따른 베이스 메이크업 제품에 대한 소비자 선호도 변화가 나타났다.
국가별 브랜드 분포를 살펴보면, 미국과 인도 브랜드가 균형을 이루고 있다. 미국 브랜드 메이블린이 단독으로 주차별 순위의 과반을 차지하는 압도적인 점유율을 보였다. 반면, 인도 브랜드로는 슈가 코스메틱, 르네, 라끄메, 스위스 뷰티 등 다양한 브랜드가 고르게 분포됐다.
특히, 슈가 코스메틱의 매트 립스틱은 집계 기간 내 세 차례 1위를 차지하는 등 높은 인기를 보여줬다.
립스틱 인기 1위, 슈가 코스메틱
슈가 코스메틱(SUGAR Cosmetics)은 2015년 비니타 싱(Vineeta Singh)이 설립한 뷰티 브랜드다.
창립자는 뷰티 구독 서비스 '팹 백(Fab Bag)'을 통해 20만 명 이상의 여성들과 소통하며 인도 여성들의 다양한 피부 톤에 맞는 제품이 부족하다는 문제를 발견했고, 이를 바탕으로 22가지 색상의 파운데이션 스틱을 포함한 다양한 메이크업 제품을 개발했다.
전 직원의 75%를 여성으로 구성하는 등 다양성과 포용의 가치를 실천하고 있으며, 여성의 자립과 사회 참여를 독려하는 다채로운 활동으로 브랜드 철학을 다져왔다.
슈가 코스메틱의 매트 애즈 헬 크래용 립스틱은 레드, 누드, 핑크, 퍼플 등 총 30가지 이상의 다채로운 색상으로 출시됐다.
인기 헤어케어 제품 분석
2025년 2월 3주차부터 5월 1주차까지 인도 아마존의 헤어케어 상위 10개 인기 제품을 분석한 결과, 헤어 세럼, 샴푸, 염모제 등 다양한 제품군이 고르게 포함됐다.
특히, 모발에 영양을 공급하고 수분을 유지해주는 기능성 제품들의 강세가 두드러졌다. 그 외에도 모발 성장과 비듬 개선 효과를 강조하는 제품들이 꾸준히 순위에 들어가 두피 건강 중심의 헤어케어가 주요 트렌드로 자리잡았다.
국가별 브랜드 분포를 살펴보면, 프랑스 브랜드 로레알이 2025년 2월 3주차에 5개, 5월 1주차에 6개 제품을 상위 10위에 올려 인도 헤어케어 시장에서 압도적인 영향력을 보여줬다.
헤어 세럼 인기 제품, 위시케어
위시케어(WishCare)는 2019년에 인도에서 출범한 뷰티 스타트업이다.
위시케어는 제품 출시 전부터 인도 소비자들로부터 피드백을 적극 수집 및 분석해 수요를 파악하고, 이를 제품 성분, 효능, 사용감을 개선하는데 활용해 브랜드 신뢰도를 높이고 있다.
3개월 이상 제품을 사용한 소비자들의 후기를 분석한 결과, 눈에 띄게 탈모가 줄고 새로운 모발이 자라기 시작했다는 경험담이 다수 확인됐다. 두피 가려움증 완화와 모발 굵기 개선에 대한 만족도가 높았다."

There's something undeniably thrilling about discovering your signature scent, after all – that one perfume that feels like a second skin, lingers in lift doors, and earns compliments from strangers. But what's even better? Finding it on sale. Enter Amazon Prime Day 2025. Running from 8-11 July, we're now on day two of the retailer's annual mega-sale, and it's still bursting with beauty deals – but the fragrance section is the true hidden gem. Think: YSL Black Opium, Gucci Bloom, Chloé Eau de Parfum, and Jean Paul Gaultier's Scandal – all at prices that feel almost too good to be true. Whether you're stocking up on an everyday spritz, investing in something sensual for evenings out, or gift-hunting for the impossible-to-buy-for, this is the moment to strike. And with savings across eau de parfums, colognes, aftershaves, and cult-favourite body mists, it's never been easier to find your perfect match – or to switch things up entirely. Below, we've rounded up the best Amazon Prime Day perfume deals for 2025, with picks from fragrance houses we know and love. The best part? They're all GLAMOUR editor-approved. STORY LAST UPDATED WEDNESDAY 9th JULY 10:50AM. Your Amazon Prime Day perfume deals FAQs, answered: When is Amazon Prime Day? What is Amazon Prime Day? How can I take part in Amazon Prime Day 2025? How we choose the best Amazon Prime Day fragrance deals The best Amazon Prime Day fragrances, reviewed How we choose the best Amazon Prime Day fragrance deals As a commerce writer for GLAMOUR, I spend an unreasonable amount of time scrolling through new fragrance launches, sifting through price drops, and mentally categorising every scent I spritz. So when it comes to Prime Day, I'm only interested in sharing the deals that are actually worth your attention. GLAMOUR's Lian Brooks testing perfumes ahead of Amazon Prime Day. GLAMOUR's Sophie Cockett testing perfumes ahead of Amazon Prime Day. I've handpicked these perfume offers based on a few non-negotiables: genuine savings, cult-status bottles, and scents I'd happily recommend to a friend or wear myself. Some are timeless bestsellers (hello, Daisy Marc Jacobs), others are underrated gems that deserve more air time. I've also kept different tastes and budgets in mind, from delicate florals to deep musks, lightweight body mists to full-bodied parfums. Whether you're loyal to a signature scent or on the hunt for something new, these are the deals I'd bookmark, spritz, and stock up on. Ahead, the top Amazon Prime Day perfume deals of 2025… 1/27 Best Prime Day fragrance deal Ghost Deep Night Eau De Toilette Why we love it: This fragrance begins with alluring top notes of Indian rose and belle de nuit flower, which bloom and release their scent exclusively at night. And with 69% of savings for Prime Day, it's a steal. 2/27 Best Daisy fragrance Daisy Marc Jacobs EDT 50ml Why we love it: If you're looking for a fresh and feminine fragrance, look no further than the cult-favourite classic that is Daisy By Marc Jacobs. This floral eau de toilette spray features notes of violet, strawberry, grapefruit and gardenia, making it a perfect summertime scent. 3/27 Best celebrity scent Ariana Grande Cloud EDP Spray Why we love it: Ariana Grande Cloud is one of the most-complimented perfumes that you can get your hands on. The best part? It's just been reduced, courtesy of Amazon Prime Day. Even years after its initial release date, Ari's perfume is still a best-seller that we know and love. Our very own writer and expert on all things perfume associates the fragrance with ""warm, slightly undercooked, doughy waffles.” An absolute must-buy. 4/27..."

Learn more Tom Ford's perfumes have developed a cult following, with a stamp of approval from celebrities like Taylor Swift and Harry Styles. Tom Ford's Lost Cherry fragrance is TikTok's latest obsession, and maybe you've already caught a whiff of the delicious and romantic scent. With notes of cherry, almond, cinnamon, rose, jasmine and plum—the scent is sweet, fresh and addictive. But a whopping $405 price tag makes it less accessible for those on a budget. That's whereDossier's Ambery Cherry perfume comes in. Beauty enthusiasts on Reddit called it first: Dossier's Ambery Cherry fragrance smells eerily similar to Tom Ford Lost Cherry's moody and sweet tones, but without the luxury markup. And it's on sale for Amazon's Prime Day sale. The 50-mL bottle of Dossier's Ambery Cherry is now available for just $39.20 on Amazon, as a result of the Prime Day Deal. Reviews of Dossier's Ambery Cherry perfume On Amazon, the scent has earned 4.2 stars out of 5, and continues to earn high praise—with over 600 reviews confirming the hype is worth it. One says: “Smells just like the original, if not better.” A second one says, “This is my everyday go-to. It's not a sickly sweet cherry scent, it's very sophisticated.” Another fan on Reddit states, “It has a sweet, sexy, and mature cherry-almond-vanilla scent that just smells amazing.” The perfume lives up to Dossier's motto, 'Everyone deserves to smell like luxury'. Dossier's Ambery Cherry scent has also made waves on TikTok, with a user claiming that “it lasts all day” and another one adding “Smells identical to Tom Ford's Lost Cherry”, and ""Bout as close as you can get to Mr. Ford's scent."" However, in contrast, some reviewers said that the fragrance doesn't last as long, ""but for the price is a definite buy if you like the cherry smell"". Another review criticized the packaging of the product, stating that it came out ""leaking/damaged inside box"", but that it was ""good value for money and lasted a few hours but not all day"". The vegan and paraben-free smell uses sustainable, non-toxic ingredients and is now on sale for Prime Day—a perfect addition to your summer beauty routine. The perfume is also sourced from Grasse, France, the perfume capital of the world. Amazon offers a wide range of similar Dossier fragrances inspired by the scents of high-end brands, such as the Ambery Vanilla inspired by YSL's Black Opium, and Ambery Saffron inspired by Baccarat Rouge 540 by Maison Francis Kurkdjian.

To highlight this milestone, Boots has revealed how customers spend their Boots Advantage Card points. The typical Boots Advantage Card member spends their points twice a year, with the majority saving up their points for at least six months (74%). Almost half (40%) spend their points over the festive** season, which means that many Brits are already starting to save for an extra treat for themselves or a gift for a loved one this December. A smaller group of 'serial redeemers' (4%) choose to spend their points on average seven times a year on daily essentials such as tissues, bottled water, cotton face pads and cleansing wipes. This group includes value-savvy parents who redeem their points on baby items. While half of Advantage Card members spend their points on daily essentials like toiletries, hair, and medicines (50%), more than a third (35%) splurge on little luxuries like premium beauty. This year, over 80,000 customers spent their points on the No7 Future Renew range and 19,000 customers treated themselves with Dior make up, skincare and perfumes. Women are more likely to save their points over several years to purchase big-ticket items worth £50 or more. The most popular product these 'super savers' are splurging on include Fitbits and over a hundred have saved enough to buy coveted Dyson products, including the £479.99 Dyson Airwrap. The top luxury items bought using over £50 of Boots Advantage Card points include: Dior Sauvage 60ml Prada Paradoxe Eau de Parfum 30ml YSL Libre 30ml Oral-B iO3 Toothbrush Lancôme La Vie Est Belle Eau de Parfum 30ml The top little luxuries bought using up to £30 of Boots Advantage Card points include: No7 Future Renew range, including Day/Night Cream and Eye Serum La Roche Posay Cicaplast Baume Olay super serum 30ml L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Bubble Slam Dunk Moisturiser 50ml Top daily essentials purchased using Boots Advantage Card points: Boots Reusable Paper Bags Breacon Carreg still water Boots Cleansing Wipes Cucumber Boots Organic Cotton Oval Pads Boots Multi Pocket Tissues Boots Advantage Card is the leading health and beauty loyalty programme, with over 17 million members.

Can anyone please message to confirm how I can place my orders? Everyone is so knowledgeable except me!"
mov_C7999053B15A8CF0A65289CC40729491,2025-07-10 19:30:57,en,WEB,"  “I always say I'm professionally myself. I'm an online-facing person who talks about pop culture, mental health, astrology, and girlhood in general. I try to be an encouraging voice to cancel out the toxic conversations we grew up with around women and aging, especially those I absorbed as a teenager in the Y2K era. When people call me an influencer, sometimes I wonder—do they mean blogger, or do they mean someone who's online and influencing perspectives, skincare routines, that sort of thing? I think the word influence is powerful, and that role has evolved so much. Now, people want storytelling. They want to feel like they know you. I first started making content when I was around 30 or 31, and I was immediately seen as 'someone older.' It was the era of Addison Rae and Charli D'Amelio, so I get it. But that positioning actually helped me. People started coming to me for nostalgia and advice. I try to take the stance of your favorite coworker trying to help you out. I know a lot of people say 'big sister,' but I have actual siblings who don't ask me for advice. [Laughs] It's funny because when people started seeing me as a voice of reason, I had never been one in my life. I'm just someone who made mistakes, learned from them, and is now telling everyone. Like, I'm the kind of girl who goes to a gray-looking buffet, gets a stomach virus, and then tells everyone, Don't go to that buffet. I never thought this would be my career. But I started gaining followers, and then someone from InStyle reached out and asked me to interview for a position helping build their TikTok presence. I thought it was spam, but we were in quarantine, and I figured I had nothing to lose, so I took the call. They offered me the job immediately. At the time, I was in a relationship and something really interesting was happening: I didn't care if people wanted to fuck me; I didn't care if people found me attractive; I didn't care if people thought I was cringey. I already had someone. And that lack of self-consciousness gave me the freedom to really be myself online. It was the perfect storm that helped me grow a following—and from there, the career grew. Suddenly I was getting asked to do red carpets. Now, I'm also writing an advice column for The Cut. I never want my advice to come from a place of shame—just from experience. Like, maybe don't kiss someone else when you're 19 and already have a boyfriend because maybe you won't feel great about it the next day. And I'm launching Tefi Talks, a topical weekly pop culture podcast, with Vox. The girls don't have anything to listen to on the subway anymore. There are a lot of surprises in store, but I can't reveal too much—yet. BEAUTY My mom and my grandma were beauty girls. I look at pictures of my mom, and she was eating these bitches up. She had a Madonna gap and brow, black hair, blue eyes, a naturally tan sort of bitch. If anything, she would accentuate her beauty. She would fluff up her eyebrows. I never heard her talk about her body. She only ever said to me, 'Have you seen your body? You're beautiful.' But we'd sit and look at tabloids together—I remember asking her what cunnilingus was because she was reading Cosmo and it came up in a column—and I started to absorb the way the media talked about celebrity bodies. Then I'd turn on the TV and hear stories like how Nicole Richie supposedly had a Memorial Day party with a scale at the door, and if you weighed over 100 pounds, you weren't allowed in. Because I'm Latin and American, it felt like I had to choose between being Sofia Vergara or Paris Hilton. Over time, I realized I had to let go of a certain idea of femininity, and that maybe people don't need to be beautiful to be interesting. And all that brain space and energy? It could've gone to so many other things. SKINCARE I used to think you had to shock your skin into behaving, but moisturizing, using sunscreen, and the PanOxyl wash with 10% benzoyl peroxide are the best things to keep my skin in check. I was a big skin picker until I started using PanOxyl. I know it bleaches your towels—I don't give a fuck I haven't had a pimple in a very long time...."

First of all I want to say that every perfume except valentino donna , ysl y , jpg le male and skin raww had strong alcohol blast and that didnt settled even after 20 mins of its application. Azzaro wanted EDP - Found it very generic like first an alcohol blast then aromatic and woody scent. 1 million edt - This one I have at him and at my home version didnt had any alcohol blast just a genuine spicy start but at SS there was a strong alcohol blast and then it followed its dry down which was amber and some spicy notes too. Dylan blue - This one had the strongest alcohol blast and like it settled after 25 mins and then I found some citruses and fresh notes in it. Found it very generic to be honest Skin raww - Didnt had any alcohol blast at start had some good fresh vibe but it faded very soon JPG Le male Le parfum - At start could smell some spicy notes and then it vanilla scent and it was quite pleasant. Valentino donna born in roma edp - Yes, its a feminine scent and no alcohol blast at all in the start it was fruity and a bit floral and woody and then after 1 hour it became more floral and vanilla scent. Ysl y - I could smell a prominent note of ginger and citruses and spicy but on fresher side and it was great to be honest but found it too generic. Nautica Voyage - It was like a fresh scent but faded too fast or maybe after smelling so many scents I couldnt smell this one. CDNIM PP - I applied it and smelled strong pungent smell of something like I dont even know what smell was it and like didnt like it. After trying designer fragrances , I must say that middle eastern perfumes are great value to money and have very increased respect for them. P.S - It was just my experience, it could be anything like testers having bad batch or anything, dont hate me for this."

Or had been in. The “one of those things” being: having your exposed foot stepped on in public or being the person to do the stepping. Everyone, at some point in their lives, has been on both sides of the equation. Today, Angela was on the side of being stepped on. And, in a fashion typical of the universe remarking “you should have stayed home,” it had been ages since the last time she had dared to go out. As in out out, like for a “la-di-da” reason as opposed to a must-get-more-groceries-from-just-down-the-block in order to survive reason. This was a quick reminder, as far as Angela was concerned, about why you should never, ever leave the house unless it was absolutely, positively necessary. No matter what the “home invasion” genre of movies tries to impart—which is the idea that shit can be terrible and horrifying anywhere, even (and sometimes especially) in your own home. But Angela would take being tortured by an intruding stranger inside her apartment any day of the week over being tortured by an intruding stranger in public. Which is exactly what happened to her as she rode the metro toward Odéon, not really sure why, just drawn to it because the stop got into her head. Not the location, but the stop name itself. She was coming from the more banal Ségur area, which, while not as teeming with tourists, wasn't really teeming with much of anything apart from residences. So yes, she had made the mistake of telling herself that she ought to go to a more “populated” area. “See the sights.” As though she hadn't seen them all after eleven years of living in Paris. And yet, to someone on the outside looking in, they might take her occasional flicker of “faith in communing with the world around her” as a positive sign. A sign that she was still capable of bothering. Yet every time she did, it sent her back into her lair for at least a month. Such was the grace afforded to her by her profession as the head of graphic design for an “ethical” hair care company that didn't notice if she came into the office or not. All they were interested in was her timely assignation and delivery of the necessary labels and promotional materials. Thus, she was that rare breed who could not only afford to be a shut-in, but to be one in a luxurious manner. Complete with a De'Longhi espresso machine that she counted as her most prized (and most used) possession. And maybe she had hopped herself up on one too many espressos before leaving, therefore made herself even more prone to being hyper-aware of all the fuckery around her. Alas, the one thing that happened too quickly for her to be hyper-aware of was getting her big toe stepped on by some brown-haired woman wearing headphones, white shorts and a tailored black vest (featuring four decorative silver-tone buttons) with nothing underneath it. A “summer chic” look that confirmed to Angela that the woman was a bona fide Parisian and not a tourist. This should have endeared Angela more to her, but the woman was clearly feeling herself a little too much, which made her careless act less forgivable. Because, as far as Angela could tell, she was distracted by her own reflection in the window of the metro as she started to rise up and inch her way out of the four-seat area, not looking at what was right in front of her as she careened into the main aisle. Angela, situated in the seat closest to said aisle, thought she had moved far enough out of the way to avoid this woman falling right into her lap. But no, that wasn't entirely the case as she felt, out of nowhere, the full weight of this woman's body on her right big toe. And while, sure, the woman was an expected Parisian waif, even waifs can feel heavy when a single big toe is suddenly tasked with “upholding” them. It was the nail of Angela's big toe in particular that was forced against its will to bear the brunt of the waif's mass, which was rounded out by high heels. Angela let out a faint cry of pain in response, but only a faint one. She was still the sort of person to show restraint in a public setting no matter how bad something hurt (physically or emotionally). Yet, despite her demure reaction, Angela was horrified to find that the waif wanted to make a “big thing” about it. Loudly apologizing and asking if Angela was okay. This, to her, was even more affronting than if she had just ignored what she had done altogether and walked away. In fact, that would have been preferable to calling all this attention to what she'd done. Making Angela's injury, so to speak, all about her. As though she needed the rest of the train to know that she was a good person. The type of person who would never do such a thing maliciously. Because, in this life, it seems that people are still naïve enough to believe that “intent” (or lack thereof) makes all the difference. But regardless of intent, it doesn't change the outcome, which, in this scenario, was to get a black and blue (with a dash of purple) toe. The waif wouldn't see the final result of her “innocent” action though. All she would see was someone “rude” in Angela. Someone who could barely mutter a “ça va” to absolve her of her crime. And it was a crime. To be so clumsy, so cavalier. Then again, Angela had never felt that way when she was the stepper in the permutation. And oh, how she had stepped on other people in her day...."

La pareja televisiva pasa por uno de sus mejores momentos profesionales y, aunque ahora la parrilla televisiva de Mediaset está en modo vacaciones, ellos continúan con sus compromisos profesionales. Uno de los eventos recientes de mayor importancia mediática al que ha acudido Sofía Suescun ha sido una fiesta de YSL Beauty, a la que acudió con un elegante vestido negro y unos zapatos de la marca valorados en 1.200 euros, como ha revelado en Instagram stories. Pero la influencer también saca tiempo para relajarse en su lujosa casa junto a Kiko y sus mascotas. Precisamente, en las últimas horas ha subido una foto de su perro Marco, asegurando que no hay ""nadie más mimoso"". Story publicada por Sofía Suescun / INSTAGRAM / @sofiasuescun Sofía Suescun Galdeano nació en Pamplona en 1996. Se dio a conocer en el panorama televisivo tras ganar Gran Hermano 16 y Supervivientes 2018, dos de los 'reality shows' más famosos de Telecinco. Desde entonces se consolidó en Mediaset participando en otros programas, como Gran Hermano Dúo. Aparte de los 'realities', Sofía se afianzó como colaboradora en distintos programas de Telecinco. Entre ellos destacano Mujeres y hombres y viceversa, Viva la vida, Ya es mediodía o Socialité. En 2021 su carrera profesional sufrió un revés, cuando fue apartada repentinamente de Mediaset, desapareciendo de la televisión hasta su reaparición en Supervivientes All Stars en 2024, donde quedó tercera finalista. Sofía Suescun también ha desarrollado una sólida carrera como influencer, colaborando con marcas como Netflix, Starz Play y Shein. Desde marzo de 2025, ha retomado su presencia en Telecinco como presentadora de la sección de realities en Socialité, consolidando su papel como figura relevante en el entretenimiento y la comunicación digital en España.

1dd80dced517d5ba91ee86d57313576e,2025-07-12 14:00:00,pl,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pl]Nie trzeba wydawać fortuny, żeby rzęsy wyglądały jak z reklamy luksusowego kosmetyku. W Rossmannie trwa promocja na tusz do rzęs, który spokojnie może konkurować z legendarnym Lancôme Idôle – a kosztuje ułamek tej ceny. Mowa o L'Oréal Paris Volume Million Lashes So Couture, który do 14 lipca (albo do wyczerpania zapasów) kosztuje 46,99 zł zamiast 69,99 zł. [Zamiennik kultowego tuszu do rzęs Lancôme Idôle w Rossmannie] Co sprawia, że ten tusz do rzęs zasługuje na miano zamiennika drogiego kosmetyku premium? Przede wszystkim formuła, która daje zjawiskową objętość bez obciążania włosków. Rzęsy są podkreślone, uniesione i dokładnie rozdzielone – nie ma mowy o pajęczych nóżkach czy grudkach. Sekret tkwi w szczoteczce millionizer, która ma silikonowe wypustki pozwalające precyzyjnie rozdzielić rzęsy, a jednocześnie równomiernie rozprowadzić produkt od nasady aż po same końce. To właśnie dzięki tej technologii rzęsy nie tylko wyglądają na gęstsze, ale też sprawiają wrażenie, jakby dopiero co wyszły spod ręki stylistki. Nie potrzeba bazy ani dodatkowych trików – wystarczy dobra technika aplikacji. Kluczem jest nakładanie tuszu dynamicznymi ruchami w górę, bez robienia przerwy między warstwami. Dzięki temu każda kolejna warstwa łączy się idealnie z poprzednią, tworząc efekt pogrubienia bez obciążenia. [Tusz do rzęs bez sklejania i osypywania] Nie każdy tusz sprawdza się w każdej sytuacji – jedne są świetne na co dzień, inne tylko na wieczorne wyjścia. Ale Volume Million Lashes So Couture bez problemu ogarnie oba scenariusze. Wystarczy jedna warstwa, żeby podkreślić rzęsy na lekki makijaż do pracy czy szkoły, a dwie-trzy dynamiczne warstwy zamienią spojrzenie w hipnotyzujące – idealne na wieczór czy randkę. Dodatkowy plus? Ten tusz do rzęs nie kruszy się, nie odbija na powiece i nie tworzy efektu pandy, nawet po kilku godzinach. To sprawia, że makijaż wygląda świeżo od rana do wieczora, bez potrzeby poprawek. A gdy przychodzi czas na demakijaż – schodzi bez walki. Jeśli rzęsy mają wyglądać tak, jakby codziennie zajmował się nimi profesjonalista, a przy okazji portfel ma nie cierpieć – ten tusz to totalny must-have. I teraz jest idealny moment, żeby go przetestować. [Promocja, której nie warto przegapić] W regularnej cenie ten tusz i tak jest wart swojej ceny, ale 46,99 zł w Rossmannie to świetna okazja. Szczególnie że wiele osób porównuje efekt, jaki daje L'Oréal Paris Volume Million Lashes So Couture, do droższych tuszów za ponad 100 zł. Jeśli więc chodzi ci po głowie zakup luksusowego tuszu, ale budżet nie pozwala na Lancôme czy YSL, to właśnie ten zamiennik z Rossmanna może uratować sytuację – i portfel. Nie dość, że daje spektakularny efekt, to jeszcze jest łatwo dostępny – wystarczy skoczyć do najbliższej drogerii albo kliknąć online, zanim promocja się skończy. A jeśli rzęsy mają wyglądać dobrze każdego dnia bez wydawania majątku, to właśnie teraz jest ten moment, żeby dać mu szansę."
