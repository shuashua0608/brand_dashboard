Its coconut fragrance has been described as pleasantly subtle by users, reports the Manchester Evening News. This self-tanner boasts an impressive average rating of 4.7 out of five from over 200 reviews. One pleased user shared: ""I've been using this for ages now. Lovely colour, doesn't go streaky or patchy. Fades nicely. No overpowering smell and because it's clear, my bedsheets are still white."" A second enthused: ""I love this tan. I've tried nearly every tan out there and this is one of my favourites, it never goes patchy or streaky. It always looks natural and lasts longer than most tans I've used."" Another customer commented: ""Really good quality! Lasted me about a week without going patchy after showering several times too! You do have to re-apply it every week! But a lot better than some of the tans I've used!"" . One more user was pleasantly surprised: ""This product shocked me as the guide colour was very pale. Was worried it wouldn't show up. After about 4 or 5 hours the colour got nice and dark. Pleasantly surprised it didn't stain white sheets."" However, not everyone was completely satisfied, as one person noted: ""So, first thing to address it the scent when you put it on, is pleasant. It is very light in colour and really spreadable, which is good. The colour starts to develop quickly but I barely noticed due to the lack of orange pigment, great. Could be darker, but seems buildable. Following on from developed colour (pre washing) I smell like biscuits, *but* fresh ones, not bad in my opinion. Only complaint is my hands smell like damp wicker, or pencils, if you know, you know."" And another review pointed out: ""Lasts longer than all other tans I've used, only problem I had was a little lighter than I expected, would be perfect if it was a bit darker but it looked nice and natural, easy to apply. ."" But another shared their positive experience: ""Lovely tanning mouse. Used to use St Tropez but this is a nicer colour and fades better. Also cheaper. Used a mitt to apply and left overnight. None on the sheets in the morning. Had quite a few compliments on the natural colour.""

Is anyone else refreshing the news every couple of minutes? I am on X (formerly Twitter) and find myself checking it every hour. I know the ending of the story (God wins) already, but I keep checking! I am praying for our military personnel and leaders. If you have a family member in the military or police force, please know how much I appreciate their service. Speaking of this country, the Fourth of July is just around the corner, and I wanted to share a fun outfit for the occasion that can be worn day or night, and even as separates. I thought these matching denim pieces were so cute. The smocked top is slightly cropped (however, none of my skin is showing), and has removable spaghetti straps for a strapless look. The skirt has a smocked waistband that flows into a gathered, ankle-length silhouette. This is a great look to wear all summer long and into early fall. I paired an open-knit cardigan over my shoulders, but for the actual Fourth, I will be wearing this one . I paired these silver sandals with this look, but they are currently sold out in most sizes… sorry! These are a cute alternative . A few other things I've been loving lately…   These shirts by Rochelle Behrens (the black is so chic)  Laundry Sauce Detergent Pods and Dryer Sheets are so dang good and make your laundry smell divine  Diamond Cocon Sheer Eye – This lightweight concealing cream minimizes the look of dark circles and puffiness with a cocktail of active ingredients and a perfecting, luminous tint of color  The Cadence System for traveling is fantastic! The Nori Trim is a high-performance fabric shaver designed to remove pills and lint from clothing and furniture. Their steam iron is great too! Biom Mini All-Purpose Wipes Starte Kit is so cute and non-toxic. I keep it in my car, in the cup holder. Karam MD Trifecta – These three products are all you need! Simple and easy! Love these “ knickers !” They are so comfortable! Juliet Wines – Such a cool concept (read here )  Recess Pickleball Paddles ARE THE CUTEST! U-Beauty Super Body Hydrator will make your arms feel smooth as glass! I love this gradual tanning lotion from Coco & Eve. This gives great color in a flash! Use Code: CATHY15               We are keeping the grandkids tonight (overnight) so their parents can celebrate their anniversary. I can't believe they've been married sixteen years. Time goes by so fast, it's scary! I hope you have a great weekend!

tw_sl_a92250348f147dc2bc9361e0d6097e2b,2025-06-26 12:16:35,fr,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[fr]Ces 10 moments des films Pixar qui ont marqué les fans Cinéma Alors que Pixar vient de sortir son nouveau film d'animation intitulé Elio et dont la performance au box-office n'est pas celle espérée par le studio, nous vous proposons de vous replonger dans les productions du studio à la lampe en s'intéressant aux différents moments qui ont marqué les fans. De Là-Haut en passant par Toy Story, Vice-Versa ou encore Wall-E, voici les 10 moments que l'on oubliera jamais. #1 Là-Haut - La mort d'Ellie Certainement l'une des séquences les plus émouvantes offerte par Pixar. Le film débute sur l'histoire de Carl et de son grand amour Ellie. La scène musicale avec une bande son signée Michael Giacchino nous montre leur vie depuis leur enfance jusqu'à l'âge adulte comme leur mariage, leurs envies de voyages, et les aléas avec une chambre sans berceau, la maladie et enfin la mort d'Ellie. Une séquence qui reste gravée dans la mémoire et qui vous a forcément fait couler quelques larmes. #2 Toy Story 2 - L'histoire de Jessie C'est à ce moment du film que l'on comprend pourquoi Jessie la cow-girl ne veut pas que Woody tente de retrouver ses amis jouets. Sur la musique When she loved me, elle raconte son histoire passée. Elle était le jouet d'une petite fille qui a l'a délaissée quand elle est devenue grande et l'a abandonnée. Une séquence émouvante qui nous plonge dans la nostalgie de nos vieux jouets et qui donne envie d'aller dans le grenier pour les récupérer. #3 Toy Story 3 - L'incinérateur La franchise Toy Story nous offre des moments poignants comme cette scène où les jouets se retrouvent à la déchèterie et sont jetés dans un incinérateur. Tentant d'échapper à ce piège, ils se rendent compte qu'il n'y a plus d'issue possible. Woody, Buzz et les autres sont résignés à mourir. Ils se tiennent la main, silencieux face aux flammes de l'incinérateur attendant leur fin. Beaucoup ont imaginé que Pixar allait véritablement détruire les fameux jouets d'Andy. #4 Le Monde de Nemo - L'attaque du barracuda Là encore Pixar nous a ému dès le début du film avec cette scène d'ouverture dans laquelle un barracuda s'attaque à la famille de Marlin. Il dévore la maman Corail qui tente de sauver ses oeufs. Marin, le père est veuf et seul Nemo survit à cette attaque. #5 Wall-E - Les souvenirs effacés du robot Wall-E est un petit robot qui séduit tout de suite les fans. Il n'a que pour seule passion de regarder en boucle sa comédie musicale favorite Hello Dolly !. Mais à la fin du film, le public a été marqué quand Otto délivre une charge électrique dans la batterie de Wall-E et lui grille ses circuits. De retour sur Terre, Eve tente de le réparer en lui chargeant la carte mémoire mais tous ses souvenirs sont effacés. #6 Vice-Versa - Riley parle de son ancienne maison Dans cette scène, Riley parle de son ancienne maison devant sa classe mais l'émotion est trop forte pour elle. La tristesse prend le dessus et la jeune fille se met à pleurer. Elle ne comprend pas ce qui se passe. Un moment qui a ému de nombreux fans qui ont certainement déjà vécu un déménagement. #7 Vice-Versa - La disparition de Bing Bong Toujours dans Vice-Versa, une autre scène culte celle de la disparition de Bing Bong, l'ami imaginaire de Riley. Très important pendant l'enfance de l'héroïne du film, Joie tente de le ramener dans les souvenirs de Riley. Mais c'est peine perdue, Bing Bong appartient désormais au passé et son sort est scellé : il est amené à disparaître. Une séquence qui montre la fin de l'innocence et de l'enfance. #8 Monstre & Cie - Sully et Bouh se disent adieu Sully se lie finalement d'amitié avec la jeune Bouh. Mais quand il doit la ramener dans son monde et qu'il doit fermer la porte, on comprend qu'ils ne se reverront jamais. Une scène émouvante surtout quand Sully dit au revoir à Bouh et lui explique qu'il ne reviendra plus. #9 Le Voyage d'Arlo - La mort d'Henry Henry est un apatosaure agriculteur et le père de Libby ainsi que de Buck et Arlo. Il ne se ménage pas pour cultiver les champs autour de la ferme familiale. Malheureusement le père disparaît de façon brutale dans un raz-de-marée alors qu'il était en train de protéger son fils. Une scène qui n'est pas sans rappeler celle du Roi Lion. #10 Coco - La chanson de Miguel à son arrière-grand-mère Très certainement une scène aussi jolie que poignante quand Miguel est aux côtés de son arrière-grand-mère qui reste immobile même quand il lui montre une ancienne photo...."
mov_6D09FEE3A43C133FCBC25D3E04221131,2025-06-27 04:31:01,en,WEB,"  All I ever need to read before adding to cart: ""I never wanted to mess around with magic, but after buying this I'm wondering what else the devil will sell me for less than $15, and why I never found it sooner."" 1. A Cosrx snail mucin serum to help get rid of dark spots, improve skin vitality, and soothe damaged skin. Yep, snail mucin is a Korean skincare product made from snail slime. Sounds ick but your skin will totally fall in love the second you use it. Hmm, wonder if this is why SpongeBob had Gary the pet snail — skincare benefits. *All Cosrx products are dermatologist-tested, cruelty-free, and have no parabens, sulfates, or phthalates. All right friends, I am here to confirm that the hype surrounding this stuff is SO real. My skin this past year has completely changed, I have gotten super serious about my skincare routine, and I am now ✨ pimple-free. ✨  Now, I am grateful that my skin has cleared up, but it was still kinda dull, uneven, ya know, the little nitpicky stuff. That is until I cracked and bought this little potion. My skin is now ra-di-annnnnnt! It's never looked better. My only regret is not taking before and after pics but glass skin, I know her. I haven't gone out in public without makeup since I was like 12 because I was so insecure about my skin. Now, I go out all the time free of makeup because I'm so comfortable with my bare face. I guarantee you'll fall in love after your first use. Promising review: ""I am obsessed with this product! It has now become an essential part of my skincare routine. The texture is very light and absorbs instantly, making my skin deeply hydrated without any sticky residue. After a few weeks, my skin brightened up, and I love how gentle it is even on my sensitive skin. It's ideal for anyone looking to give their skincare routine just that little extra boost in hydration and repair. Highly recommended!"" —Sanyae Gibson Get it from Amazon for $15.99 (available in a two-pack). 2. A hydrating eye stick to help reduce dark circles, lines, and puffiness while delivering moisture without oils. Sensitive skin friends, this one's for us. People may start to think your goldfish are Cosmo and Wanda because these results are jaw dropping. Promising reviews: ""I HAD to write a review. I use this in the morning and night after my whole face routine and putting on moisturizer. I don't have dark bags however, my under-eyes do get a bit puffy and I was noticing fine lines. DUDE, those fine lines are fading. Last night I went to a party and woke up looking like the crypt keeper, and this stuff normalized my creepy zombie eyes in about 20 minutes. It's $9. Do yourself a favor and buy it."" —Jasmine Deatherage Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in three styles and in multipacks). 3. And an under-eye brightener because you aren't sure if you'll ever actually not be exhausted, but you can def stop looking like it. It's ~enriched~ with shea butter and hyaluronic acid to give your dark circles a more radiant look. The pinkish tint helps balance out the blueish tint under your eyes as if you said a spell to make your dark circles *poof* away. Promising reviews: ""Anyone with dark under eye probs like myself need to have a brightener! I used to spend $40 on Becca, but this one is better in my opinion!! It's very pigmented and covers blue hues in the corners of my eyes. It can be worn alone, but I prefer it under my concealer. It blends incredibly well, it's very creamy, and easy to apply. It will probably last me six months — a little dab goes a long way. It's extremely buildable, too. I am just so in love...."
mov_B937B60EECA0C69DC95B319D5121E09A,2025-06-27 19:01:02,en,WEB,"  About three hours and 45 minutes into his duel with Carlos Alcaraz three weeks ago, Jannik Sinner lowered himself into his return stance for what he hoped would be the last rally of a near-flawless fortnight. Sinner held three championship points for what would be one of the most monumental victories of his career. Just one of those three would have earned him a first grand slam title away from hard courts and redefined the terms of engagement with Alcaraz, the only player to beat him for 10 months. Sinner would then have drawn level with the Spaniard on four grand slam titles. Related: What to watch out for at Wimbledon 2025: no line judges and more expensive strawberries The margins that determine success have always been precarious but few occasions exemplified this like Paris. Instead of Sinner reinforcing his status as the world's best, Alcaraz produced another legendary moment in his young career with one of the greatest comebacks of all time. Although the Italian remains No 1 and the best player in the world based on his performances over the past year, on the eve of Wimbledon Alcaraz is the player to beat. Since Roland Garros, the momentum and good vibes surrounding the champion have only increased. He followed his three-day interlude in Ibiza by winning at Queen's Club for a second time. While he still considers clay his favourite surface, the 22-year-old's grass record is astounding. He has amassed 29 wins and three defeats, winning 25 of his past 26 matches on the surface. He has more grass-court titles – four – than losses. He heads into Wimbledon as the clear favourite and will attempt to become the fifth man in the Open era to win the singles title three times in a row. It will take time for Sinner, who is nine months older, to come to terms with the French Open defeat, which was still playing on his mind when he lost in the second round of the Halle Open last week to Alexander Bublik. But another grand slam tournament also provides him with an opportunity to forge ahead with fresh motivation. Alcaraz and Sinner have shared the past six grand slam titles, shutting out the rest of the field and until there is a significant shift, it is difficult to choose the rest of the field over these two players. Novak Djokovic, however, continues to relish the challenge of trying to disrupt the youngsters. At the age of 38 he has clearly been third-best player at the grand slams this year, reaching two semi-finals, with victories over Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev. On grass, where the seven-time Wimbledon champion's understanding of the surface is second to none and the faster conditions are more helpful to his ageing body, Wimbledon has always represented his biggest opportunity of becoming the oldest slam champion in the Open era. It is clear that Jack Draper will command the most attention at the beginning. The Briton's past year has been remarkable, with the 23-year-old rising from No 40 to No 4, winning his first Masters 1000 title at Indian Wells and reaching his first slam semi-final at the US Open. Draper has everything he could possibly want to make a deep run on the grass – a well-rounded, increasingly complete game and his destructive lefty serve and forehand are well-suited to the fast surface. While most British players have some sort of early breakthrough at Wimbledon, Draper, at 23, has never passed the second round and his success has come on foreign shores. He has never experienced the pressure and attention that comes with being a top home player and genuine contender on Centre Court. In the long run, Draper has the character and single-minded focus to handle these situations and produce his best tennis but the coming week will be a fascinating test of his character and current readiness for these moments. The women's draw is shrouded in even more uncertainty. Aryna Sabalenka has clearly established herself as the top player but, like Sinner, she arrives at Wimbledon with her ego bruised after her dramatic three-set defeat to Coco Gauff in the French Open final. Her tactless comments after the defeat, and the backlash they generated, only made things even more difficult for her. The Belarusian remains the favourite to win a first Wimbledon title, where the grass aids her ultra-offensive shotmaking. Related: 'It helped me be free': Madison Keys on therapy, Donald Trump and her husband as coach Beyond Sabalenka, there is even less clarity. Gauff has solidified herself as a true championship player by winning her second slam in Paris. However, despite her breakthrough run coming at Wimbledon, when she reached the fourth round from qualifying on her slam debut as a 15-year-old, the American, now 21, has struggled to find her best on grass. Iga Swiatek's difficulties on grass are similarly well established but, with every year, the former world No 1 does appear to grow more comfortable. After an extremely difficult period on court this year, she did leave Roland Garros with her head held high despite her dominance in Paris coming to an end after her semi-final loss to Sabalenka.

Mirra Andreeva's improved serve should make her even more dangerous this year.

mov_6C8E021193309AB74ED6949A663EF8AD,2025-06-27 19:01:02,en,WEB,"  About three hours and 45 minutes into his duel with Carlos Alcaraz three weeks ago, Jannik Sinner lowered himself into his return stance for what he hoped would be the last rally of a near-flawless fortnight. Sinner held three championship points for what would be one of the most monumental victories of his career. Just one of those three would have earned him a first grand slam title away from hard courts and redefined the terms of engagement with Alcaraz, the only player to beat him for 10 months. Sinner would then have drawn level with the Spaniard on four grand slam titles. The margins that determine success have always been precarious but few occasions exemplified this like Paris. Instead of Sinner reinforcing his status as the world's best, Alcaraz produced another legendary moment in his young career with one of the greatest comebacks of all time. Although the Italian remains No 1 and the best player in the world based on his performances over the past year, on the eve of Wimbledon Alcaraz is the player to beat. Since Roland Garros, the momentum and good vibes surrounding the champion have only increased. He followed his three-day interlude in Ibiza by winning at Queen's Club for a second time. While he still considers clay his favourite surface, the 22-year-old's grass record is astounding. He has amassed 29 wins and three defeats, winning 25 of his past 26 matches on the surface. He has more grass-court titles – four – than losses. He heads into Wimbledon as the clear favourite and will attempt to become the fifth man in the Open era to win the singles title three times in a row. It will take time for Sinner, who is nine months older, to come to terms with the French Open defeat, which was still playing on his mind when he lost in the second round of the Halle Open last week to Alexander Bublik. But another grand slam tournament also provides him with an opportunity to forge ahead with fresh motivation. Alcaraz and Sinner have shared the past six grand slam titles, shutting out the rest of the field and until there is a significant shift, it is difficult to choose the rest of the field over these two players. Novak Djokovic, however, continues to relish the challenge of trying to disrupt the youngsters. At the age of 38 he has clearly been third-best player at the grand slams this year, reaching two semi-finals, with victories over Alcaraz and Alexander Zverev. On grass, where the seven-time Wimbledon champion's understanding of the surface is second to none and the faster conditions are more helpful to his ageing body, Wimbledon has always represented his biggest opportunity of becoming the oldest slam champion in the Open era. It is clear that Jack Draper will command the most attention at the beginning. The Briton's past year has been remarkable, with the 23-year-old rising from No 40 to No 4, winning his first Masters 1000 title at Indian Wells and reaching his first slam semi-final at the US Open. Draper has everything he could possibly want to make a deep run on the grass – a well-rounded, increasingly complete game and his destructive lefty serve and forehand are well-suited to the fast surface. While most British players have some sort of early breakthrough at Wimbledon, Draper, at 23, has never passed the second round and his success has come on foreign shores. He has never experienced the pressure and attention that comes with being a top home player and genuine contender on Centre Court. In the long run, Draper has the character and single-minded focus to handle these situations and produce his best tennis but the coming week will be a fascinating test of his character and current readiness for these moments. The women's draw is shrouded in even more uncertainty. Aryna Sabalenka has clearly established herself as the top player but, like Sinner, she arrives at Wimbledon with her ego bruised after her dramatic three-set defeat to Coco Gauff in the French Open final. Her tactless comments after the defeat, and the backlash they generated, only made things even more difficult for her. The Belarusian remains the favourite to win a first Wimbledon title, where the grass aids her ultra-offensive shotmaking. Beyond Sabalenka, there is even less clarity. Gauff has solidified herself as a true championship player by winning her second slam in Paris. However, despite her breakthrough run coming at Wimbledon, when she reached the fourth round from qualifying on her slam debut as a 15-year-old, the American, now 21, has struggled to find her best on grass. Iga Swiatek's difficulties on grass are similarly well established but, with every year, the former world No 1 does appear to grow more comfortable. After an extremely difficult period on court this year, she did leave Roland Garros with her head held high despite her dominance in Paris coming to an end after her semi-final loss to Sabalenka.

d2bda61785c553ca3408a9fb9da85813,2025-06-28 10:30:00,en,WEB,"  Sneha Jaiswal (Twitter | Instagram) There's a dude called Frank, and a gorgeous greenish-eyed girl called Cleo, they meet at a New Year's Eve party, joke about their names sounding like pop culture figures 'Cleopatra and Frankenstein'. Then they hook up, get married, sort of fall in love, run through some trouble. Because, boohoo, life sucks. And don't be misled by the title, this is a straightforward, contemporary fiction romance. Page 121, it was only until I got to page 121 of 'Cleopatra and Frankenstein' that it finally got readable and interesting. That's when author Coco Mellors finally introduces a new and realistic character in a world cluttered with unbearably pretentious 'good looking'/'glittering' people. Until then it took me 12 days to get to page 121, and only 1 day to finish the rest of the over 200 pages. Until then, I was softly crying inside, and loudly bitching to my friends in a group chat about how books like these slow down my reading pace and reading goals for the year. Until then, this book was barely one star out of five. Now I am settling for 2 stars, which by Goodreads standards is supposed to mean 'it was okay'. 'Cleopatra and Frankenstein' is simply about a stunningly beautiful, 'Roman Goddess Level Gorgeous' (the author repeats this fact several times through the book) Cleo, a 20-something art graduate, hooking up with 40-something Frank, a successful advertising executive, and them referring to each other as Cleopatra and Frankenstein maybe 4 times in the book. The two quickly get married for Cleo's to extend her visa and stay on in New York. But as is with rushed marriages based on physical attraction, they realize their 'love' isn't the lasting kind of love. And the book follows them being unbearably pretentious (I am aware I've already used this term, but well, the author keeps repeating stuff in the book too) and annoying. Cleo becomes a bored, whiny, artsy brat who doesn't even make art anymore, while Frank drowns himself in work and alcohol and starts to fall for someone else. You know that character from page 121, she is a 30-something and joins Frank's work-place as a temporary copywriter. Let's just call her 'Page 121', to keep this review spoiler-free, in case you decide to read the novel, despite my criticism. And of course, there's a high chance you may like it more than I did. Frank and Page 121 have an easy chemistry and their banter in the second-half of 'Cleopatra and Frankenstein' is quite witty, funny, and entertaining. Coco Mellors' writing style for the novel is mostly reader-friendly. It's not impressively literary, lucid, or characteristic, the sentences are well-woven, but without any striking details. Although, it does seem like 'Cleopatra and Frankenstein' is laden with deliberate familiar philosophical musings meant to encourage readers to share as 'quotes'. For instance, Page 121 has a lovely relationship with her mother, but her mum often talks like a 'self-help book' author, instead of a regular maternal human being. Except for Page 121, and an obese chef trying to lose weight, everybody is exceedingly good-looking in the book, which is usually their defining characteristic. For instance, Frank's young step-sister Zoey, is a drop-dead gorgeous aspiring actor, and unlike Frank, she is black-american. Zoey is essentially Cleo in a different skin color, and seems to exist in 'Cleopatra and Frankenstein' only for token black representation. She is still in college, lives like a rich trust fund kid, and gets aggressively worked up over racial issues even though she never faces any sort of discrimination in the novel. 'Cleopatra and Frankenstein' aspires to be a Jazz age literary novel for the 2020s: it's all about sex, drugs, alcohol, money, parties, infidelity, and beautiful people doing annoying things. Thankfully, some of the primary characters do 'grow up' towards the climactic chapters, or at least pretend to, and Coco Mellors wraps the story in a conveniently closing chapter that doesn't match with the rest of the tone, but will be satisfactory for many readers.

mov_450D0C4B68414BF7C4DE6C857B0681CF,2025-06-29 09:31:00,en,WEB,"  Another glorious fortnight awaits us as Wimbledon captures Britain's imagination again from Monday. However, while there are some things you can bank on – strawberries, rain delays and slippy grass – the actual sport can throw up plenty of intrigue. So we tasked our experts with picking their winners, wildcards and dream scenarios before the first ball is whacked in anger. Here are their predictions: All right, I'm not sure I actually believe this, but it's just too dull to predict a third Carlos Alcaraz title on the bounce. And if the new “Big Two” reach the trophy match, Jannik Sinner will have maximum motivation to seek revenge for that epic French Open final. Winner: Jannik Sinner I cannot look beyond the player who has lost on grass just three times in his life. Fortified by winning an astonishing French Open final and by his second triumph in three years at Queen's, the Spaniard is poised to complete a Wimbledon 'three-peat' at 22, a year earlier than even Roger Federer managed it. Winner: Carlos Alcaraz After the French Open epic, Queen's and his impressive history on grass, it is hard to look past Carlos Alcaraz to lift the title again. For someone who only recently turned 22, he manages himself well on the tour, giving himself time off – like a short break in Ibiza after the French Open, only to come back and win at Queen's. Given his last two titles, it is hard to see how anyone can stop him on grass, although Novak Djokovic may view Wimbledon as his best chance to win a 25th grand-slam tournament. Winner: Carlos Alcaraz It is hard to look past the Spaniard winning again, especially after his victory at Queen's. Given how uncomfortable Jannik Sinner looks on grass at times, if they met in the final, I'm backing the two-time winner. Winner: Carlos Alcaraz It takes a true mystic to predict a Wimbledon ladies' champion these days. Look at the last three winners: Barbora Krejcikova, Marketa Vondrousova and Elena Rybakina. Most sports fans wouldn't know them from Eve. So, let's plump for another winner from the Eastern Bloc, past or present. How about 18-year-old Russian prodigy Mirra Andreeva? She has the distinct advantage of having Conchita Martinez, the 1994 champion here, in her player box. Winner: Mirra Andreeva The world No 1's crushing baseline power should have secured her the Venus Rosewater Dish by now, but the combination of a shoulder injury and the All England Club's 2022 ban on players from Russia and Belarus has ruled her out of two of the past three tournaments. She believes her game is well-suited to grass and has reached both grand-slam finals so far this season. Winner: Aryna Sabalenka After reaching three successive major finals, it is hard to think that Aryna Sabalenka will at least not be standing on Centre Court for the women's final day, but it remains to be seen how much those final losses will have affected her. Grass is not a straightforward surface, but it is more likely to suit Sabalenka than Coco Gauff, who cannot defend in the same way she did at Roland Garros. Although the women's draw is often a lot more open than the men's, with a far greater chance of upsets. Winner: Aryna Sabalenka The women's winner is much harder to predict. We haven't had a repeat winner since Serena Williams in 2016 so I'll be picking Aryna Sabalenka to finally get the job done. Her route to the final is kind and she's the biggest draw. Winner: Aryna Sabalenka A hefty 15 wildcards have boosted the British contingent to 23, the highest number since 1984. But their draws are collectively horrible, so it could be a bloodbath over the first few days. Jack Pinnington Jones is one left-field prospect who could prove a handful. His first-round opponent is to be Tomas Martin Etcheverry, a confirmed clay-courter from Argentina. I struggle to envisage a bountiful harvest here. The draws for the main hopes could scarcely be worse: both Jack Draper and Emma Raducanu potentially face former champions in the second round, while Katie Boulter will do well to dispatch world No 9 Paula Badosa in the first. But a fast-improving Jacob Fearnley could go far. Despite there being more British players in the main draw than any other year since 1984, most of those have come in via the wildcard system, and only one, Jack Draper, is seeded. Should he find an impressive run of form post-tonsilitis, there is a good chance he will be in the second week, although it is hard to see if any other British players will join him. Emma Raducanu will be the favourite against fellow home-grown talent Mimi Xu, but after that 2023 champion Markéta Vondroušová and Aryna Sabalenka stand in her path, while Katie Boulter was drawn against ninth seed Paula Badosa. It is going to be a struggle for the Brits. I can see a lot of first-round exits. The best hope of a deep run is Jack Draper. Katie Boulter vs Paula Badosa is a good test for the former to see what level she is at. As the No 7 seed orenzo Musetti is no slouch...."

mov_ADED4DAFF02F8454B2277E8F8A729779,2025-06-29 15:43:41,en,WEB,"  Being Emma Raducanu is not the easiest task. For all the positives that come with achieving fame early, as she did after her stunning US Open triumph as an 18-year-old in 2021, the obligations and attention can be intense. Invariably when she plays her photo is splashed on the back pages and her every move is scrutinised. At Wimbledon the attention grows exponentially and nothing is off limits, as Raducanu discovered when she batted away questions about a possible romance with Carlos Alcaraz, a longtime friend, with whom she will play mixed doubles at the US Open. As Andy Murray learned over many years, dealing with all that takes experience and patience. No wonder, then, that Raducanu says she is not looking much further than her first-round battle with the 17-year-old Welsh player Mimi Xu on Monday. “Truthfully I don't expect much from myself this year,” she said on the eve of the event. Related: Novak Djokovic confident Wimbledon is his 'best chance' of extending slam record “I know I've been dealing with certain things. I just want to go out there and embrace the moment. I want to embrace the occasion. I know there's not many opportunities to be playing at Wimbledon. You get it once a year and for a finite amount of time. I'm just looking forward to going out there and feeling the surroundings and the atmosphere.” Though the 22-year-old has already experienced so much in her career, it is worth remembering that this will be only her fourth Wimbledon. She reached the last 16 on her debut in 2021 and again last year, showing her aptitude for grass and revelling in front of her home crowd. After having surgery on both her wrists and one ankle in 2023, she dropped outside the top 300 but has worked her way back up the rankings to No 40, which also makes her the British No 1 again, a nice rivalry with Katie Boulter developing. Her grass-court season began with two good wins at the revamped women's event at the Queen's Club, and then in Eastbourne last week she lost in the second round against Maya Joint, the Australian who went on to win the title. There Raducanu said she was dealing with some bad news off the court but she was all smiles this weekend, practising with Boulter on Sunday. “I had one day off after Eastbourne, which is not much time,” Raducanu said. “Right now I'm just happy to be at Wimbledon. That is a great kind of motivation to just keep going and deal with everything else afterwards.” Raducanu has also been battling a niggling back issue in recent weeks, with occasional spasms a cause for concern and discomfort but nothing serious. “It's just been managing [it], as I've said the last few weeks,” she said. “I wouldn't say it's 100% but a lot of the time with tennis players nothing is ever 100%. So just taking it as it comes.” John McEnroe, a three-time Wimbledon singles champion, had back issues early in his career. Reflecting now he wonders whether they were caused by the stress of the tour. Raducanu has the use of all the best doctors, of course, but stress is an undoubted factor in players' injuries and maybe something she looks at too, in due course. Providing Raducanu gets past Xu she is likely to play Marketa Vondrousova, the 2023 champion, which would be a far from easy proposition. Get through that and the world No 1 and tournament favourite, Aryna Sabalenka, may well be waiting in round three. Having pulled out on the opening day of last year's event with a shoulder injury, the Belarusian cannot wait to get started. “I'm super excited, super happy to be back, to be healthy and to be able to compete at this beautiful tournament,” she said. Sabalenka and Coco Gauff, who beat her to win the French Open three weeks ago, are seeded to reach the final, but both know there are many threats and dangers lurking in the draw, including Madison Keys, the American who won her first grand slam title at the Australian Open in January, when she beat Sabalenka in a brilliant final. Jasmine Paolini, the runner-up last year, is back, as is last year's champion, Barbora Krejcikova, who missed the first five months of this season because of a back injury. The Czech's victory last year made her the eighth different champion in the past eight tournaments on the women's side, and with Elena Rybakina (2022), Vondrousova and Petra Kvitova (2011 and 2014) the only previous champions in the draw, another new winner is a distinct possibility. Kvitova will be making her last Wimbledon appearance, having announced she will retire after the US Open. The 35-year-old is back after missing last year's event because of the birth of her son and plans to enjoy every moment. The left-hander's performance in the 2014 final against Eugenie Bouchard remains one of the best of any final in Wimbledon history. She will be missed."

n1b66ts,2025-07-04 14:15:29,en,REDDIT,  Here's something that has worked for me. I'm 58F and my skin has some spots and scars from all the years. I have used self tanner (coco and eve; jergens natural glow). I am pretty pale and use the lightest shade to just even out my skin. But my favorite is Tinge. I think it's marketed as a “body foundation” or “body makeup”. It's about $40 but the bottle lasts a long time. There's a skin color test on their website. I bought a body brush from Amazon for about $10. It does not rub off on clothes or sheets and gives me an airbrushed/filter look. Covers enough of the spots/discoloration to make me look a lot better. Not chalky or fake. I just love it. Here's a good representation. It's on the right leg. No paid endorsement or anything like that. ! [img](ojntpblj8vaf1)

It's amazing, I don't even need to apply cream to my dry parts! My new obsession."" This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it. Learn more While the sun has been gracing us with its presence and stifling heat lately, the British sunshine doesn't always allow us to get that glorious sun-kissed glow that makes people think we've been gallivanting along the Amalfi Coast. However, basking in the sunshine, while it might seem like a quick route to bronzed skin, with extended exposure can result in sunburn, skin damage, and premature ageing - hardly the summer look we're aiming for. Fortunately, there's a safer method to achieve that radiant glow: a decent fake tan. While there are a plethora of formulas available, viral brand Coco and Eve's Sunny Honey Bali Bronzing Foam is a favourite, with one being sold every 20 seconds. What's more is this exact formula - alongside a number of Coco & Eve's other best-selling products - has been included in Amazon's Prime Day sales, with up to 30% off, meaning that instead of £34, it'll cost £23.80 with the mitt, or £18.20 from £26 without. The lightweight, fast-drying tanning foam is a firm favourite amongst shoppers and is made with raw virgin coconuts, botanicals and amino acids to hydrate, blur pigmentation and cover blemishes. It's also infused with the brand's Cellushape technology packed with powerful natural antioxidants like fig, banana, papaya and cocoa 'to improve signs of aging'. It has garnered a 4.4-star rating on Amazon alone from over 8,000 reviewers for being the 'best tanner on the market', delivering an 'outstanding' natural-looking tan in a little as six hours. Plus, unlike some other formulas that can sometimes veer into the realms of Oompa Loompa orange, Coco and Eve's foam is formulated with a green-grey base to create a golden, sun-kissed finish. With a tropical mango and guava scent, the brand also ditches the typical biscuit fragrance that so often gives away the fake-ness of the tan. Available in three shades - medium, dark and ultra dark - there's a version to suit every skin tone, reports the Manchester Evening News. Sunny Honey Bali Bronzing Foam £26 £18.20 Coco & Eve Buy Now on Coco & Eve Anti-aging self tan with zero nasties. Created using our unique Cellushape formula to hydrate and firm the skin. Fast drying formula with colour guide technology develops in 6+ hours into a natural, even, healthy-looking tan. The Honey Bronzing foam has garnered some impressive reviews online, with one happy shopper sharing: ""This is the best tan I've ever got. I've been told so many times it looks so flawless. This, plus the face mist (also now on sale), is the greatest combo yet. I won't go back to any other tan."" The bronzing foam has also been praised for delivering a streak free tan - which is something many tans struggle to achieve. One person said: ""I am a very pale skinned person who has been advised to not sit in the sun. So Coco & Eve is the perfect solution! Easy to apply, no streaking and no horrid smell. I recommend this to all who want a tan without the sun . Don't buy any other product."" Another echoed: ""Wow wow wow, I have used almost every tan and when you wash it of it completely goes! But with this tan it sticks like glue! It's amazing, I don't even need to apply cream to my dry parts! My new obsession."" However, there are some less favourable opinions. One unhappy user reported: ""I have used tons of self-tanners, and for some reason, I find this one so blotchy."" For those concerned by the mixed feedback, alternative options include the St.Tropez Self Tan Express Mousse, known for its week-long, natural-looking, streak-free, and flawless results. It's currently on sale at Boots for £22.66 from £34. Alternatively, Bondi Sands Self Tanning Foam One Hour Express Ultra Dark boasts a high 4.86-star rating on Lookfantastic for its quick absorption, 'quick turnaround' and 'super bronzed' finish 'without being too orange toned for patchy'. It's currently on offer for £14.99 from £19.99. However, one Coco & Eve enthusiast could help but wax lyrical about the product and said: ""This bronzing foam is amazing. The colour is so natural and beautiful, I love it so much. Multiple people asked if I had recently returned from a vacation after applying it."" The brand's tanning foam isn't the only product also included in Amazon's sale. The Coco & Eve Honey Bronzing Face Drops usually £22, is down to £15.40...."

Learn more Aryna Sabalenka is through to the Wimbledon 2025 semi-finals, set to face Amanda Anisimova for a place in the final. A world number one tennis player, Aryna has fashion fans turning their heads not only for her exceptional game, but her glittering collection of jewellery. Dazzling spectators, the 27-year-old showcased a number of accessories on the court, including earrings, necklaces and bracelets. Aryna seems to favour layering her jewellery, mixing gold and silver metals with pops of beads, gem stones and colour. Switching things up from a classic tennis bracelet, shoppers can emulate her style with some similar jewellery found at Abbott Lyon, Monica Vinader, H Samuel and more. Plus, members of Amazon Prime can nab some designer pieces for less in the Prime Day sale. Those that are not members can sign up for a free 30-day trial here.

The Ted Baker Farah Faceted Stone Heart Necklace was £75 but is now £37.50, alongside the matching earrings that are now £17.50. Sharing a similar turquoise colour to Aryna's collection, shoppers say they are able to 'sleep and shower in them with no problems at all' and the 'blue stone is unique and offsets against the gold well'. Another option can be found at Abbott Lyon - the Green Quartz Heart Necklace is £69 , the matching Huggie Earrings are £59 and the Bracelet is £89. Calling them 'absolutely beautiful' shoppers say they get 'lots of compliments when wearing' them. It is also important to note they are waterproof, which means no tarnishing or green staining and the earrings are 'not too heavy' - ideal for those that also plan to wear them while playing sports. Aryna can be seen wearing a green gem choker-style necklace and we've found a similar buy at Monica Vinader. It is an investment piece priced at £498, but the tennis necklace is made from 18K gold vermeil and green onyx it should last a lifetime, even when worn everyday. For a cheaper alternative, consider this Sterling Silver and 18ct Gold Plated Vermeil Green Chain Necklace on sale at H Samuel. Originally £79.99, it is now £49.99 with one customer saying 'I bought these for my bridesmaids and it's an amazing product'. This necklace does only come in one size, which may be problematic to some, however the Monica Vinader necklace is adjustable."

1lvucnq,2025-07-09 21:06:23,en,REDDIT,"  I've never used self tanner before, I'm on accutane so I can't tan. I bought the coco and eve mousse tanner in the shade dark, (I have fair skin) and I planned on doing a patch test on my foot or something to see how long I should leave it on. It came with a mitt, a back applicator and a brush. I've watched a few youtube videos but I am so scared to use it because I have a wedding to attend on sunday. (today is wedensday). How long does it last? How often does it need reapplied? I've read to exfoliate and shave first, does this mean I should shave my arms too? (I have hairy arms, blond hairs at that). If you use tanner on your face, how do you keep it out of your hair? Just saw a reddit pots of a girls blond hair turning orange from tanner. What clothes do you recommend wearing after applying? I have a roommate so I can't wear my birthday suit."

Over the past few years, my team and I have tested more than 50, and that includes charcoal grills, gas grills, portable grills, electric grills, and of course all the different accessories. The Weber Q 1200 liquid propane grill was Good Housekeeping's best overall pick at $259. We got really good heat distributions. And it has these folding side tables that *** lot of portable girls don't have. The Coleman Road Trip 225 portable tabletop propane grill was the best value pick at $165. There's two different cook zones on it, so you can cook one side on higher heat and then the other side on the lower heat. And for *** picnic, the Everdrecu portable charcoal grill costs $125. It heats up quickly, it's easy, it's lightweight, and it has these nice handles on the side so you can bring it with you. Good Housekeeping approved grilling gear for $50 or less. There are *** few things I always need with me when I'm grilling outside. These are some of the grilling products that Good Housekeeping editors love the most. First, the Turner and Tom's grilling set from Oxo for $23. They have these grips on the side so they stay cool, and they have this really great hook so you can hang it on the side of your barbecue. And there's actually even *** little bottle opener to check the. on your meat. This ultra fast thermometer from lava tools costs $43. It responds super quickly. You can actually see it's already reading the temperature of the room and it's magnetic, so you can actually stick it to the side of your grill or on your fridge, and this way it's always handy when you need it. And to grill up some veggies, this $24 grill pan from Weber, perfect for the things that'll fall through the grates. It cleans pretty easy and if you want, you can actually even store it right on your grill. It's summer grilling season and these Good Housekeeping approved gifts are sure to stand out at your next barbecue. First, this 6 piece knife set from Schmidt Brothers sells at stores like Crate and Barrel for about $150. This one comes in this beautiful case and all the knives you need to cut *** really large brisket or *** really good steak, and they'll always stay sharp. Testers also love seasoning with these spice kits from the Spice House. You can buy individual spices. Or grab their gi boxes which start at $38. You can get the ones that are made for your barbecue, so we have *** smaller size, *** larger collection, and if you want to try *** bunch of different flavors, these from Rodney Scott are delicious. And the Meter Pro wireless thermometer, which costs $130 will really amp up your grill gain. It measures the internal temperature of food as well as the ambient temperature of the grill. You connect it to your phone, you can walk away, and they'll tell you exactly when it's done. Need help getting caked on grease off your grill? These Good Housekeeping approved tools should make cleaning up *** breeze. First, these Mr. Siga microfiber cloths come in *** 12 pack for around $13. They're not too expensive, and you can use them on the outside to get all this grease, or you can pair them with *** degreaser and really get *** good clean. This one is *** favorite from Good Housekeeping's cleaning lab. It's the $16. Grill cleaner and degreaser spray from Parker and Bailey. It cleans up messes really quickly and it can be used on the inside of your grates or the outside of your grill. Bristles from wire brushes can break off and stick to your grill grates, causing serious danger if ingested. Instead, testers like this $20 coiled grill brush from Kona. It really scrapes the grapes. It's great for your cast iron grapes, and I would do it as soon as you're done cooking, and you won't have to think about it the next time you cook. These Good Housekeeping approved coolers will keep your drinks ice cold. We test hard coolers, we test soft coolers, we test coolers on wheels, totes, you think it, we test it. Like the $200 Igloo Trailmate journey cooler. It retains temperature really well and it has these really big bulky wheels that are actually good for all different terrains. For *** lightweight option, the Arctic Ultra Light 52 quart hard cooler costs $210. so it's 30% lighter than other coolers that are this size.

Learn more The mousse is said to be lightweight, fast drying, non-sticky, and develops in two hours for a long-lasting tan(Image: Amazon / Coco & Eve) A bronzing self-tanner mousse set, which customers have described as ""outstanding"", is now 31% off on Amazon Prime Day. The Coco & Eve Sunny Honey Bali Bronzing Self Tanner Mousse Set in dark shade and a 200ml was £34 but is now £23.35, providing a £10.65 saving for shoppers looking for a natural-looking, sunkissed skin for the summer. According to Amazon, this fake tan is the world's first 100% Natural DHA self-tan body treatment with full skin care benefits. It aims to transform the applier's skin ""without any of those nasty streaks or blotches"". The product is infused with raw virgin coconuts, botanicals and amino acids to hydrate and blur pigmentation or blemishes. READ MORE: The seven best beauty deals you can get in Amazon Prime day deal chosen by an expert LATEST: Elizabeth Taylor's perfume that 'every woman should have' now less than £20 on Amazon It has a tropical mango and guava scent to it, which might be a nice change for appliers that have experienced a biscuity-smell with previous fake tan products. The mousse is said to be lightweight, fast drying, non-sticky, and develops in two hours for a long-lasting tan. According to its description, ""a little goes a long way"", as each bottle has roughly 260 pumps and can last approximately 10-20 full body tanning sessions. If you are looking for a fake tan product that has a cheaper price tag, LookFantastic is offering a discount price on its Bondi Sands Liquid Gold Self Tanning Foam, which was £17.49 but is now £13.12. On Boots, the Isle of Paradise 30 Minute Express Self-Tanning Mousse 200ml, is sold for £21.95. The best way to apply fake tan, is to firstly, make sure your skin is all clean, deodorant, perfume, lotion or deodorant-free. Then, apply the fake tan in a circular motion, with a small pump for the tricky-to-tan areas, like feet, hands, face and ears. After two hours, shower in warm water and gently pat the skin dry with a towel. If you want a deeper, longer-lasting tan, it may be worth sleeping overnight with the coat of applied tan, but make sure you wear dark clothing to avoid any potential stains. The Coco & Eve self-tanner mousse is also cruelty-free, vegan, all natural and has never been tested on animals. The product has received a rating of 4.4 out of five stars and over 8,000 reviews. ""I'm mega impressed with this one,"" one happy customer said. ""I just wanted something for my legs as they never see the light of day and are pale. ""This stuff is fab!! It goes on so easily, develops a lovely colour, no streaks and smells fab! I hate that fake tan smell, but I honestly can't smell it with this! Really happy and will be my go to from now on."" Another shopper said: ""I rarely leave reviews but this product is amazing. I'm a real novice using fake tan but I followed instructions of exfoliating and moisturising before using etc. ""It didn't streak at all and colour is beautiful without being too dark for me as I'm quite light skinned. I used it for my daughter's wedding and had loads of compliments about it (guests thought I'd recently been away on holiday!) . I will definitely buy more."" While another reviewer described it as ""outstanding"" and added: ""I am a very pale skinned person who has been advised to not sit in the sun. So Coco and Eve is the perfect solution! Easy to apply, no streaking and no horrid smell. I recommend this to all who want a tan without the sun . Don't buy any other product.""

""It's so sticky, I couldn't sit down for an hour after I put it on...."

n2gz65m,2025-07-11 01:23:36,en,REDDIT,"  I recently read the series from start to present for the first time. I think the silver eve arc suffers from a flaw common in lot of manga...it forces you to assume everyone except the main character and her friends is incompetent. The adults were not useful, despite presumably being talented and educated witches. No one really brought any ideas to the table except the intrepid heroine. Everyone appeared to just hand-wring until saved by an undertrained child's imagination. Before this arc you could reasonably see Qifrey, the three head witches, and a couple others as at least passebly competent adults. It was a story about a complex world with complex characters, motivations, strengths, weaknesses. But silver eve destroyed that illusion. It can now be presumed that Coco and occasionally her friends are the only ones who will accomplish anything of significance, and all other characters are just there to be foils or to cheer them on."

It has over 8,000 five-star reviews on Amazon, and has been included in the retailer's Prime Day sales, which ends tonight Eve Rowlands Senior Shopping Writer, and Bethan Shufflebotham Affiliates and Reviews This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it. Learn more Shoppers have got just hours left to get their mitts on a popular fake tan for a fraction of its usual price. It comes as viral brand Coco and Eve has discounted a selection of their bestselling products by 30% for Amazon Prime Day, which ends today. The British sunshine doesn't always grant us that enviable sun-kissed glow that suggests we've been frolicking on the Amalfi Coast. That's why many turn to 'glow in a bottle' formulas to achieve a bronzed complexion from head to toe - not to mention that it's safer than sun exposure, which can lead to sunburn, skin damage, and premature ageing. Offering a safe and sunless alternative, Coco and Eve's Sunny Honey Bali Bronzing Foam has been a hit with tan fans, with one being sold every 20 seconds. As part of the Amazon sale event it's currently £23.80 with the mitt, down from £34, or £18.20 from £26 without. The lightweight, quick-drying tanning foam is popular among shoppers and is made with raw virgin coconuts, botanicals and amino acids to hydrate, blur pigmentation and cover blemishes. It's also infused with the brand's 'anti-cellulite' Cellushape technology packed with potent natural antioxidants like fig, banana, papaya and cocoa 'to improve signs of aging'. The Honey Bronzing foam by Coco and Eve is making waves, scooping up a 4.4-star rating on Amazon from over 8,000 reviewers who hail it as the 'best tanner on the market'. It's acclaimed for producing an 'outstanding' natural-looking tan in just six hours – a far cry from the dreaded Oompa Loompa hue, thanks to its green-grey base that ensures a true golden glow, reports the Manchester Evening News. Gone are the days of that give-away biscuity scent, as this tanner boasts a tropical mango and guava aroma. Available in three shades - medium, dark and ultra dark – there's something for every skin tone. Shoppers online have been heaping praise upon the bronzing foam, with one satisfied customer saying: ""This is the best tan I've ever got. I've been told so many times it looks so flawless. This, plus the face mist (also now on sale), is the greatest combo yet. I won't go back to any other tan."" The product is also commended for delivering an even, streak-free tan – a notable achievement where many tanners fall short. A reviewer noted: ""I am a very pale skinned person who has been advised to not sit in the sun. So Coco and Eve is the perfect solution! Easy to apply, no streaking and no horrid smell. I recommend this to all who want a tan without the sun. Don't buy any other product."" Another fan enthused: ""Wow, wow, wow, I have used almost every tan and when you wash it off it completely goes! But with this tan it sticks like glue! It's amazing, I don't even need to apply cream to my dry parts. My new obsession."" However, not all reviews are glowing. One dissatisfied user complained: ""I have used tons of self-tanners, and for some reason, I find this one so blotchy."" For those concerned by the mixed feedback, alternative options include the St.Tropez Self Tan Express Mousse, known for its week-long, natural-looking, streak-free, and flawless results. It's currently on sale at Boots for £22.66 from £34. Alternatively, Bondi Sands Self Tanning Foam One Hour Express Ultra Dark boasts a high 4.86-star rating on Lookfantastic for its quick absorption, 'quick turnaround' and 'super bronzed' finish 'without being too orange toned for patchy'. It's currently on offer for £14.99 from £19.99. Nonetheless, one Coco and Eve devotee couldn't help but sing praises about the product, saying: ""This bronzing foam is amazing. The colour is so natural and beautiful, I love it so much. Multiple people asked if I had recently returned from a holiday after applying it."" Amazon's sale isn't just spotlighting the brand's tanning foam; it also includes the popular Coco and Eve Honey Bronzing Face Drops, now reduced from the usual £22 to just £15.40. Packed with five types of Hyaluronic Acid, these drops offer more than just an enviable Ibiza-worthy tan, they also provide instant hydration and plumping effects for the skin, minimising fine lines and wrinkles. In addition to hyaluronic acid, the drops combine the skin-firming qualities of Coconut Water with the intense moisture benefits of banana, which aids in hydration and repair. Coco and Eve are slashing prices on their much-raved haircare range this Amazon Prime Day, offering deals on their renowned Miracle Hair Elixir, reduced to £20.30 from its usual price of £29, not to mention deals on shampoo and conditioner sets now at £25.20. While the brand's cult beauty buy and miracle-working Like A Virgin masque is not available on Amazon currently, for those whose hair needs some serious TLC (it has been known to restore dry, damaged hair in just one use), the Like A Virgin Hair Masque is on sale on the Coco & Eve website for £22.50 down from £30. With a fig and coconut scent, the hair mask works as a 5-in-1 'miracle worker'. It's been known to hydrate, condition, improve hair texture and shine, treat split ends and tame frizz in as little as 10 minutes and works a treat on hair that's been bleached, heat-damaged and more. The 'hair hero' has had some serious compliments from shoppers, including one which described the mask as 'the best product I've ever used on my hair'. However, not everyone was impressed, with some feeling 'underwhelmed' and commenting: ""I'm not sure this product quite meets the hype, I've certainly used standard and significantly cheaper products that deliver better results. Maybe it depends on your hair type, I'd recommend other high street brands that offer banana and honey masks for hair!"" You can find Amazon's sale on Coco and Eve products here."

Usually I do a conditioning mask on my hair too but I ran out. Right now is #primeday so all of my favorite products are on sale and on my storefr0nt! I use these products on the regular and love them for hair, skin and wellness. Product descriptions ••• 1. farmacybeauty's whipped green cleanser is the best. All of their products are SO good! ♀️ 2. AsIAm scalp cowash - I do these every few washed before my shampoo to help with scalp dryness. As a kid, my hair was constantly cornrowed and braided which wrecked my scalp. I have to be really careful with products because I get flare up's and breakouts from scalp psoriasis. This definitely helps freshen me up and reduce that problem. 3. Shampoo 2x . I do a rotation but right now I am using Cibu products. I also love coco and Eve, especially the hair mask. They are also having a great prime sale! 4. I love the EOS body products! I have the lotions and body wash in cashmere vanilla and it makes you so smooth and delicious smelling. 10/10! 5. Exfoliate ! I use treehut or anything that smells amazing. I love the vanilla and coconut scents most. It's better to do this BEFORE shaving. 6. Lotion right after the shower on your hands, body and face to lock in the moisture from the water. I love the FARMACY honey halo collection because it keeps your (face) skin super hydrated. another 10/10 I will stand on business about. 7. Sea breeze! This astringent keeps you fresh in those places you need to be. It's also great for drying out pimples after my period breakouts! 8. Scalp oil! I have been using the D'amour scalp oil with rosemary and jojoba for a few years now and it's definitely helped with growth and fighting the postpartum hair war. Iykyk. ♀️ 9. Pureology for split ends! I love applying this to the ends of my hair after every wash. It smells good and keeps your hair soft and healthy. 10. Red light therapy. I just purchased this for prime day & I'm excited try it! #amazonprime #beauty #care"

1lz6htj,2025-07-13 22:59:19,en,REDDIT,"  So I am pretty pale and I recently started looking into self tanning, because I like to have a bit more color, but I'd rather avoid the sun damage. Last year I got the Tan Luxe Gradual self tanner, and I really liked it on my first application. It was even and also faded evenly. But the second time I applied it it faded pretty unevenly, I looked like I had vitiligo for a good week and it kind of scared me off. Today I did it again after a month and a half of exfoliating and moisturizing thoroughly (I kept procrastinating the tan application): it came out streaky in a few places and it didn't take well in others. I realise maybe I wasn't very careful in the application, I forgot to use circular motions for example. Maybe I used too much product at once? So I looked for tutorials, but that opened me to a whole new universe of products and techniques, and I am feeling pretty overwhealmed. I think I'd like to try a colored mousse, because seeing where you are applying the product might be helpful to prevent streaks (?) . I read good reviews for the Coco and Eve mousse, and I also found a kit with an application mitt and a brush at a reasonable price. Has anyone tried it? Is it good for pale skin, like does it pull orange? What color should I get? On lookfantastic the lightest shade available at the moment is medium. Is it too dark? Too light? Does it really make much of a difference? Also if anyone has any tips on how to apply gradual self tanner I would appreciate it, because I still have more than half a bottle to get through. Would applying another layer of tanner in a few days make the streaks better or worse? And honestly any tips are welcome, because I have no idea what I'm doing"
