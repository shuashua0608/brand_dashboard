4B5994BE21750709A5F225D6A4F16A1F,2025-07-01 06:30:28,en,PRINT,"  A ""KIND and highly talented"" Liverpool-based drag superstar died after suffering a cardio-respiratory arrest after taking ketamine at their home in Cheshire, an inquest has concluded. Friends told of the harrowing moment they found James Lee Williams - known to many as The Vivienne - in the bath at their home in Chorlton-by-Backford in Cheshire on Sunday January 5. It is suspected they had died two days earlier. During the inquest into James' death at Cheshire Coroner's Court in Warrington, family and close friends paid tribute to the drag star, who shot to fame after winning the first season of RuPaul's Drag Race UK as The Vivienne, and was widely known and loved in their adopted city of Liverpool. James used the pronouns them/ they in life, which the ECHO will use when referring to them in this article - other than in direct quotes from evidence given to the inquest where ""he or him"" was at times used. Friends and family told the inquest they became concerned for James on Sunday January 5 having not heard from them for some time. Friend and neighbour Janine Godbold told the hearing that having spoken to James' friends, she decided to drive to their house, for which she had a key. She and her son Ryan became increasingly concerned as they approached the house and saw James' dog Panda desperately trying to get out. They ventured into the house and upstairs where Janine found James in the bath. In an emotional account, she said: ""He just looked like he was sleeping. I ran over to him and put my hand under his head to stop his face going into the water. ""I screamed for Ryan, telling him he needed to call for an ambulance and to get some help. I kept hold of them because I didn't want their face in the water. Then I just sat with James and made sure his head didn't go under the water."" The court also heard from James' best friend Bobby Musker, who described James as ""the kindest person I knew, who would help everyone."" He said he was aware of James' struggles with ketamine, saying he would go long stints without taking it, before returning to take the drug. Mr Musker had spoken to James on the evening of Friday January 3 and told the court he believed he could recognise that James had been using the drug at the time - adding that he had taken an Uber into Liverpool, which made him think James had been to purchase the drug. Mr Musker told the court: ""I could kind of tell when he was on it, so I could tell he had taken some."" Concluding his emotional evidence, Mr Musker added: ""Him taking drugs didn't define him as a person. He did so much good. I don't want the public to see him just as what has happened, with drug use, that wasn't the person that defined him. There was a lot more to him."" The court was read a written statement by Dr David Butterworth, a forensic pathologist who carried out the post-mortem on James. Dr Butterworth said he was clear in his statement that James died from the effects of cardiorespiratory arrest due to the use of ketamine and said there were no signs of drowning in the bath. While the amount of ketamine in James' system was not as high as amounts usually associated with toxicity or death, Dr Butterworth said the amount may have been higher initially as he wasn't found for two days. He said: ""In my opinion, the cause of death was cardio-respiratory arrest due to ketamine use."" Earlier in the inquest, James' father Lee Eliott Williams had spoken movingly, stating that James was ""full of life"", ""outgoing"" and was always there to help others achieve their goals as they achieved theirs. Mr Williams added: ""He never turned his back on anyone, he wanted to help his community, to help other drag queens achieve their goals."" Before recording her verdict, Senior Coroner Jacqueline Devonish, asked the family of James Lee Williams for their thoughts. James' sister Chanel told the court: ""We acknowledge that James' death is as a result of drug use but we wholeheartedly know that was not his intention. ""He loved life, he loved his family and friends and he loved his career. We feel that the conclusion should be one of misadventure."" Recording her verdict, Ms Devonish described James as ""hard-working, highly talented, charismatic and well liked and loved."" She added: ""He did a lot for his community and he made a name for himself as a performing artist and as a drag artist as The Vivienne. His family say he was very bold in pursuit of his dreams and that he made a difference. ""It is very important to the family that James is not remembered for his use of ketamine, because drugs don't define the person he was."" The coroner said that on the balance of probabilities, it is likely that James died on the evening of Friday January 3. She said the toxicology results show that there was still a fairly high amount of ketamine in James' system when he was found two days later, adding that the toxicology results suggest an ""acute overdose"". She said the medical cause of death will be recorded as cardio-respiratory arrest due to ketamine use. Concluding, the coroner added: ""On the balance of probabilities, I am satisfied that James Lee Williams' death was a misadventure. He took ketamine but he did not intend to end his own life."""

Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ. Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính. Nó là biểu tượng của một thách thức toàn cầu: khi hàng giả ngày càng tinh vi, thương mại điện tử ngày càng phát triển, và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng ngày càng dễ bị lợi dụng. Mỗi cú nhấp chuột mua hàng mà không kiểm chứng nguồn gốc có thể tiếp tay cho một đường dây tội phạm khổng lồ đang hoạt động ngay giữa lòng đô thị văn minh. Và mỗi vụ án được bóc trần – như đế chế hàng hiệu giả 1 tỷ đô ở Manhattan – là lời nhắc nhở rằng: cuộc chiến chống hàng giả chưa bao giờ đơn giản.

Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ. Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính. Nó là biểu tượng của một thách thức toàn cầu: khi hàng giả ngày càng tinh vi, thương mại điện tử ngày càng phát triển, và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng ngày càng dễ bị lợi dụng. Mỗi cú nhấp chuột mua hàng mà không kiểm chứng nguồn gốc có thể tiếp tay cho một đường dây tội phạm khổng lồ đang hoạt động ngay giữa lòng đô thị văn minh. Và mỗi vụ án được bóc trần – như đế chế hàng hiệu giả 1 tỷ đô ở Manhattan – là lời nhắc nhở rằng: cuộc chiến chống hàng giả chưa bao giờ đơn giản. Nguồn: Tổng hợp"

(Nguồn video: Access Hollywood) Lễ cưới của tỷ phú Amazon Jeff Bezos và Lauren Sánchez tại thành phố Venice, Ý đã tốn không ít giấy mực của truyền thông. Đặc biệt, sự xuất hiện của cặp đôi Leonardo DiCaprio và Vittoria Ceretti cùng chiếc váy rách đầy ""drama"" của nàng siêu mẫu, tạo nên một chủ đề bàn tán sôi nổi. Vittoria Ceretti gây ấn tượng với chiếc váy vintage Dolce & Gabbana tại tiệc cưới Jeff Bezos vào ngày 28/6. (Nguồn ảnh: Page Six) Ngay từ khi vừa xuất hiện trên chiếc taxi sang trọng để đến dự tiệc tối, Vittoria Ceretti đã gây trầm trồ khi khoác lên người thiết kế màu xanh ngọc pastel lấp lánh của Dolce & Gabbana. Bộ váy mang phong cách cổ điển, thanh lịch với phần tà dài thướt tha và chất liệu ánh kim nhẹ nhàng phản chiếu ánh đèn thành Venice, khiến Ceretti trông như bước ra từ một giấc mộng thời trang. Siêu mẫu Vittoria Ceretti khoe vẻ đẹp rạng ngời trong bộ váy diện tại lễ cưới của tỷ phú Jeff Bezos. (Nguồn ảnh: Instagram nhân vật) Thế nhưng, chỉ vài tiếng sau khi hình ảnh mãn nhãn này lan truyền trên mạng xã hội, cư dân mạng lại được phen ngỡ ngàng khi thấy chiếc váy “lộng lẫy” ban đầu đã bị rách toạc thành hai mảnh lớn ở phần dưới, để lộ rõ các đường may. Vittoria sau đó đã chia sẻ khoảnh khắc ""vỡ trận"" này lên story Instagram với tinh thần khá thoải mái, ví von bằng cách đăng ảnh “Before - After” của chiếc váy kèm chú thích đầy ẩn ý. Ceretti gặp sự cố váy rách tại buổi tiệc. (Nguồn ảnh: Shutterstock/Vittoria Ceretti) Dù bản thân người đẹp sinh năm 1997 không tiết lộ lý do cụ thể khiến váy bị rách, nhưng nhiều nghi vấn đã được đưa ra. Có người cho rằng chiếc váy có thể quá mỏng manh so với cường độ di chuyển, trong khi số khác không loại trừ khả năng va chạm, giẫm chân hay… sự cố “ngoài kịch bản” thường thấy trong những bữa tiệc sang trọng đông người. Tất nhiên, đó vẫn chỉ là những suy đoán. Tuy nhiên, điều khiến dân mạng xôn xao hơn cả không phải là vết rách, mà là nguồn gốc của chiếc váy ấy. Không ít khán giả tinh mắt nhận ra, thiết kế Ceretti mặc tại lễ cưới có đường nét và màu sắc gần như giống hệt bộ váy mà Gisele Bündchen - bạn gái cũ của Leonardo DiCaprio - từng diện tại Met Gala năm 2003. Siêu mẫu Gisele Bundchen từng diện mẫu váy giống như Vittoria Ceretti. (Nguồn ảnh: Penske Media) Chi tiết này ngay lập tức thổi bùng cuộc tranh luận trên các nền tảng mạng xã hội. Nhiều người cho rằng đây chỉ là một sự trùng hợp thú vị giữa hai biểu tượng sắc đẹp. Nhưng một số lại cho rằng Ceretti - dù vô tình hay hữu ý - đang “mượn” hình ảnh của Gisele Bündchen như một cách tái hiện vòng quay thời trang, hoặc thậm chí là gửi một tín hiệu ngầm nào đó về vị trí “chính thức” bên cạnh Leonardo DiCaprio. Tất nhiên, không ai xác nhận được liệu chiếc váy ấy có phải cùng một mẫu với váy Gisele từng mặc hay không. Cũng chưa có phát ngôn nào từ phía Dolce & Gabbana về thiết kế này. Nhưng trong thế giới thời trang - nơi mọi ánh nhìn đều khắt khe - sự giống nhau đến bất ngờ giữa hai bộ váy là đủ để khơi gợi những đồn đoán không hồi kết. Loạt ảnh mới nhất của Vittoria Ceretti gây xôn xao khi cô diện chiếc váy được cho là giống hệt thiết kế mà tình cũ của Leonardo DiCaprio từng mặc. (Nguồn ảnh: Instagram nhân vật) Vittoria Ceretti (SN 1998, tại Brescia, miền Bắc nước Ý) là cái tên không còn xa lạ với giới mộ điệu thời trang. Bắt đầu sự nghiệp người mẫu từ năm 14 tuổi, Ceretti nhanh chóng trở thành “con cưng” của các ông lớn trong ngành thời trang như Chanel, Prada, Fendi, Valentino, và Armani. Cô cũng nhiều lần xuất hiện trên trang bìa của,  các ấn phẩm đình đám như Vogue (nhiều phiên bản quốc tế), Harper's Bazaar hay Elle. Với gương mặt góc cạnh và thần thái lạnh lùng đậm chất Ý, Vittoria luôn được đánh giá là một trong những người mẫu high fashion nổi bật nhất hiện nay. Vittoria Ceretti bắt đầu hẹn hò với tài tử Leonardo DiCaprio từ khoảng giữa năm 2023. Cặp đôi thường xuyên bị bắt gặp xuất hiện cùng nhau tại các bữa tiệc riêng tư hay sự kiện thể thao, nhưng luôn kín tiếng về mối quan hệ của mình trước truyền thông. Leonardo DiCaprio và Vittoria Ceretti  nhiều lần được bắt gặp đi dạo trên phố. (Nguồn ảnh: BackGrid) Cũng chính vì vậy, khi chiếc váy của Ceretti bị cho là giống váy của Gisele - người tình lâu năm nổi tiếng nhất của Leonardo - công chúng lại càng chú ý. Gisele Bündchen và Leonardo DiCaprio từng yêu nhau suốt 5 năm - mối tình dài và sâu đậm bậc nhất trong danh sách tình sử của tài tử Titanic. Họ từng là cặp đôi quyền lực nhất thảm đỏ Hollywood thời bấy giờ, cho đến khi Gisele chủ động rút lui vì muốn ""sống chậm"" hơn và tập trung vào cuộc sống cá nhân. Giờ đây, khi bạn gái mới của Leonardo DiCaprio “vô tình” tái hiện hình ảnh huyền thoại của Gisele trong một dịp trọng đại, lại còn gặp sự cố váy rách ngay tại siêu đám cưới của Jeff Bezos, nhiều người cho rằng đó không chỉ là trùng hợp mà là một khoảnh khắc mang tính biểu tượng. Sự việc nhanh chóng trở thành chủ đề bàn tán sôi nổi, khiến cộng đồng mạng vừa thích thú vừa không khỏi tiếc nuối khi nhớ về những bóng hồng từng gắn bó với Leonardo DiCaprio.

Speaking to U.K. radio station Capital FM at the premiere, the pregnant star, who voices Smurfette in the movie, shared her top pick when it comes to taking to the mic. “Ohhhh!” she said as she thought about her answer and placed her hand on the side of her head. “Oh my gosh, it's, it's, it's … maybe 'Burning Blue' by Mariah the Scientist,"" she continued with a laugh. The track, which was released in May and premiered its music video on May 8, is the lead single from the R&B singer's upcoming fourth studio album, according to Billboard. It peaked at No. 25 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Сегодня книги стали незаменимой частью массовой культуры: селебрити охотно позируют с новинками на камеру,  а бренды включают их в маркетинговые кампании. Некоторые просто начали скупать книги, чтобы казаться умнее и привлекательнее — одни ставят их как фон для видеозвонков, другие берут их с собой на прогулку как красивый аксессуар.   Книжные клубы также становятся новой популярной формой досуга. Все больше знаменитостей запускают свои читательские сообщества, где ежемесячно предлагают новую книгу и обсуждают ее с подписчиками.  Впрочем, сегодня, чтобы стать участником клуба, не нужно быть фанатом конкретной звезды — тематические сообщества легко найти как в офлайне, так и онлайн. Их создают книжные магазины, издательства, культурные пространства и просто любители литературы. Фото: Ugur Akdemir / Unsplash Механика книжных клубов довольно проста: участники заранее договариваются, какую книгу читают, а затем собираются, чтобы обсудить прочитанное. Формат встреч может быть любым — от офлайн-собраний в кафе до регулярных Zoom-сессий. Иногда книги читают вслух прямо на встречах. Обычно разговор ведет модератор — он помогает структурировать обсуждение, предлагает вопросы и следит за ходом беседы. В некоторых клубах к встречам присоединяются гости — авторы, переводчики, редакторы или книжные блогеры. Как зародились книжные клубы Идея собираться вместе, чтобы обсуждать книги, уходит корнями в античность. Еще в школе Сократа ученики рассуждали не только о литературе, но и о философии, политике и природе человека. Более привычный для нас формат появился позже — одним из первых стал клуб «Джунто», основанный Бенджамином Франклином в XVIII веке. Участники встречались по пятницам, чтобы говорить о литературе, а также организовали общественные проекты. Коммерческая модель книжного клуба появилась в 1926 году. Американец Гарри Шерман придумал подписной сервис Little Leather Library — за $2,98 читатели получали 30 небольших книг и шоколад в подарок. Позже проект перерос в клуб «Книга месяца», где редакторы выбирали важные произведения и рассылали их подписчикам.  Современный всплеск популярности начался в 1996 году, когда телеведущая Опра Уинфри запустила собственный книжный клуб. В рамках своей передачи она рекомендовала новинки, обсуждала их со зрителями и авторами. Проект стал настолько успешным, что вскоре за ним последовали другие знаменитости.  Сейчас книжные клубы есть у Сары Джессики Паркер, Дуа Липы и Риз Уизерспун. Последний — Reese's Book Club — стал настоящим феноменом: книги, попадающие в его список, неизменно становятся бестселлерами на годы. Только в 2023 году ее рекомендации разошлись тиражом более 2,3 миллиона экземпляров. Фото: Face to Face / Global Look Press К книжным клубам подключились и модные бренды. В 2024 году Miu Miu провел первую встречу своего литературного клуба в Милане, собрав представителей индустрии, журналистов и медийных персон. Chanel развивает проект Les Rendez-vous littéraires rue Cambon,  где они знакомят читателей с женской литературой. Dior также не остался в стороне — бренд посвящает литературе специальные мероприятия, приуроченные к новым коллекциям. Чем объясняется популярность книжных сообществ сегодня В мире, где цифровые технологии вытесняют живое общение, а ощущение одиночества становится все более распространенным, особенно среди молодежи, людям все чаще требуется так называемое «третье место» — пространство, отличное от дома и работы, где можно регулярно встречаться и общаться.  Книжные клубы как раз стали такой площадкой. Они дают возможность обсуждать прочитанное в кругу единомышленников, высказывать мнение, слушать других и развивать критическое мышление. Это не только способ взглянуть на текст под новым углом, но и повод выработать привычку к регулярному чтению и вдумчивому восприятию информации. Популярность литературных сообществ сегодня усиливается за счет внимания со стороны известных персон. Книги все чаще появляются в руках у селебрити, а книжные рекомендации становятся частью публичного образа.  Кроме того, важную роль сыграли социальные сети. В TikTok активно развивается сообщество BookTok, где пользователи делятся короткими отзывами, подборками, инсайтами и участвуют в литературных челленджах. Это вовлекло в чтение новую аудиторию и сделало обсуждение книг популярным форматом досуга.

Tháng 11-2025, Hội nghị lần thứ 30 các Bên tham gia Công ước Khung của Liên Hợp Quốc về Biến đổi khí hậu (COP30) sẽ được tổ chức tại Brazil - quốc gia sở hữu phần lớn rừng Amazon. Đây là lần đầu tiên sự kiện khí hậu trọng đại này chính thức đưa vấn đề rừng nhiệt đới vào chương trình nghị sự, trong bối cảnh các cánh rừng tại Amazon đang đối mặt với nguy cơ bị tàn phá nghiêm trọng bởi nhiều nguyên nhân, từ việc trồng đậu nành, các vụ cháy rừng, cho đến một nguyên nhân gián tiếp ít ai nghĩ đến: Ngành công nghiệp da. Mối liên hệ giữa da thuộc xa xỉ và nạn phá rừng Theo báo cáo của Earthsight, da được sử dụng để chế tác những chiếc túi xách sang trọng bậc nhất lại có nguồn gốc từ hoạt động chăn nuôi gia súc bất hợp pháp tại khu vực Amazon. Điều đáng báo động là chăn nuôi gia súc chính là nguyên nhân hàng đầu gây ra nạn phá rừng quy mô lớn trong những năm gần đây tại vùng đất này. Để làm rõ sự việc, Earthsight đã tiến hành một cuộc điều tra toàn diện, bao gồm phân tích tài liệu pháp lý, dữ liệu thương mại, hình ảnh vệ tinh và thậm chí là điều tra bí mật tại các nhà thuộc da ở Italy. Kết quả cho thấy sự liên đới rõ ràng của nhiều thương hiệu lớn trong chuỗi cung ứng đầy rủi ro này. Báo cáo đặc biệt nhấn mạnh hoạt động chăn nuôi gia súc bất hợp pháp tại bang Pará, phía Bắc Brazil. Tại đây, một khu vực rộng gần gấp đôi diện tích Bồ Đào Nha đã bị thiêu rụi trong vòng 20 năm qua. Sau khi được giết mổ, da của những con gia súc được chuyển đến hai nhà thuộc da của Italy là Conceria Cristina và Faeda. Đáng chú ý, hai nhà thuộc da này là đối tác thường xuyên của các thương hiệu thời trang cao cấp. Những tên tuổi lớn bị điểm mặt Coach, thương hiệu thời trang Mỹ nổi tiếng với những chiếc túi xách sang trọng ""dễ tiếp cận"", có giá bán từ 300-600 euro (350,42 - 700,84 USD) và đang hướng đến thế hệ trẻ, được xác định là một trong những khách hàng của hai nhà thuộc da trên. Không chỉ Coach, Earthsight còn điểm mặt nhiều thương hiệu danh tiếng khác cũng mua da từ Conceria Cristina và Faeda, bao gồm: Chanel, Chloé, Hugo Boss, Fendi và Louis Vuitton (thuộc tập đoàn LVMH), cùng với Balenciaga, Gucci và Saint Laurent (thuộc tập đoàn Kering). Mặc dù tất cả các thương hiệu trên đều phủ nhận việc sử dụng da từ Brazil, nhưng sau khi nhận thông báo về cuộc điều tra, một số đã nhanh chóng khởi động các cuộc điều tra nội bộ, trong khi số khác cung cấp thông tin về nguồn gốc da của họ cho Earthsight. Điều đáng nói, trong khi các cuộc điều tra đang diễn ra, ngành công nghiệp da vẫn tiếp tục vận động hành lang nhằm thoát khỏi các quy định bảo vệ rừng mới của châu Âu, dự kiến có hiệu lực vào cuối năm nay. Thậm chí, một sự kiện đã được tổ chức tại Nghị viện châu Âu (EP) để thúc đẩy lợi ích của họ. Lời kêu gọi hành động Ông Rafael Pieroni, Trưởng nhóm Mỹ Latinh của Earthsight, thẳng thắn bày tỏ sự thất vọng: ""Người tiêu dùng các sản phẩm xa xỉ thường kỳ vọng rằng mức giá cao sẽ đảm bảo họ không góp phần vào nạn phá rừng hay việc chiếm đoạt đất của người bản địa. Cuộc điều tra này cho thấy niềm tin đó đang bị đặt sai chỗ. Chừng nào các thương hiệu thời trang chưa thực hiện đầy đủ trách nhiệm rà soát chuỗi cung ứng của mình, họ sẽ không thể đảm bảo rằng sản phẩm của mình không liên quan đến những hành vi lạm dụng này"". Vào tháng 1-2026, Quy định Chống Phá rừng của Liên minh châu Âu (EUDR) sẽ chính thức có hiệu lực, buộc các doanh nghiệp phải chứng minh rằng da và các nguyên liệu thô khác mà họ sử dụng ""không liên quan đến nạn phá rừng"". Bà Marie Toussaint, Phó Chủ tịch nhóm Greens/ALE tại EP và là người tham gia xây dựng đạo luật này, nhấn mạnh tầm quan trọng của báo cáo Earthsight. ""Báo cáo của Earthsight đến đúng lúc: Nó tiết lộ rằng ngay cả những nhà mốt lớn của châu Âu cũng có nguy cơ liên quan đến việc phá hủy rừng Amazon"", bà Toussaint cho biết. Theo bà, ""trong bối cảnh cánh hữu và cực hữu đang tìm cách làm suy yếu quy định chống phá rừng của châu Âu, công trình này một lần nữa nhấn mạnh lý do tại sao luật này là cần thiết để bảo vệ quyền con người và các hệ sinh thái.

Ce week-end, Stormi Webster, la fille aînée de Kylie Jenner, issue de sa relation avec le rappeur Travis Scott, était à Venise à l'occasion du mariage de Lauren Sánchez et Jeff Bezos, auquel sa mère, aujourd'hui en couple avec Timothée Chalamet, était invitée. Tandis que le gotha célébrait l'événement, au détour d'un bateau-taxi, c'est une petite silhouette qui a capté l'attention et déclenché l'admiration des modeuses. La fillette s'est en effet illustrée en arborant deux looks Chanel vintage, issus des archives de la maison française. Du haut de ses 7 ans, la fille de la vedette américaine de téléréalité a prouvé que le sens du style se cultivait dès l'enfance (surtout lorsque l'on a une mère à la garde-robe impressionnante). Au fil des publications Instagram de Kylie Jenner, on découvre l'enfant tout sourire, perchée sur les genoux de sa mère, vêtue de pièces Chanel. Son premier look ? Un débardeur à volants en velours noir, assorti d'une jupe de la même matière. Une silhouette chic et intemporelle qui semble être une version miniature (et sur-mesure) d'une pièce de la collection automne 2001 de Chanel — soit 17 ans de plus que Stormi. Affichant l'ensemble en story, la fondatrice de Kylie Cosmetics a légendé : «Fancy Girl». Minirobe en velours magenta Mais c'est le deuxième look de Stormi qui a encore plus attiré l'attention des fans de mode : une minirobe en velours magenta, brodée des logos Chanel. Cette pièce rappelle une création culte du printemps 1996, initialement portée par Linda Evangelista et réinterprétée par Kylie en 2019 dans une version sans manches. Aussi, elle évoque l'une des tenues portées par Iggy Azalea dans son clip Fancy, elle-même inspirée du film Clueless. Une référence entre mode et culture pop. Durant ce même voyage, la petite fille a également porté un mini-sac à main matelassé de la maison française. Assorties Ce n'est pas une première fois que Stormi Webster apparaît dans des tenues fashion. Comme une «mini me», elle avait assisté au défilé Valentino de janvier 2024 dans un look assorti à celui de sa mère : robe noire, fourrure, ballerines vernies, lunettes de soleil et mini-sac de la griffe. Bien que ses apparitions publiques soient encore rares, elles donnent le ton sur son potentiel mode."

Des années plus tard, le retour de cette chaussure pour le moins antique n'est pas pour la contredire : longtemps fustigée et considérée comme un soulier ringard, la spartiate revient en force sur le devant de la sphère fashion, adoubée par les modeuses aguerries et sur les podiums des défilés.

mov_AE68DC4D03200A163F33590A8D76A3BC,2025-07-01 13:11:00,en,WEB,"  The global personal luxury goods market, valued at USD 410 billion in 2024, is projected to reach USD 526 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.24%. The U.S.-China trade war poses challenges, impacting costs and availability. Key trends include circular economy initiatives, online retail strategies, and urban demand in emerging markets. Segment growth varies, with watches and jewelry leading, while beauty and fragrances witness fastest growth. APAC remains the dominant region, driven by urbanization and digital retail transformation. Major players like LVMH and Rolex leverage strategic partnerships and innovation to maintain market positioning. Personal Luxury Goods Market Dublin, July 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Personal Luxury Goods Market Research Report 2025-2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Personal Luxury Goods Market was valued at USD 410 billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 526 billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 4.24%. The global personal luxury goods market is fragmented and characterized by numerous manufacturers that hold modest market share. Key players, including LVH, Prada Group, Rolex, Kering, and Richemont, among others, have established dominance in the market by continuously innovating and expanding their product offerings. Major vendors are strategically implementing innovative technologies to maintain their market positions. For instance, in 2023, Burberry introduced its virtual store by partnering with Blankos Block Party, a gaming platform, and offering interactive product discovery. The companies in the personal luxury goods industry are also focusing on several strategic partnerships with other providers to ensure continuous supply chains and manufacturing capabilities. For instance, in 2023, Kering completed a 30% acquisition of the Italian luxury fashion house Valentino. The partnership is between Valentino's parent company, Mayhoola, and it has also provided an option for Kering to acquire the remaining 70% by 2028. The leaders in the personal luxury goods market are making significant R&D investments to enhance the availability and differentiation of their products. For instance, in 2024, Richemont acquired Vhernier, which is an Italian jewelry brand, to enhance its Jewelry Maisons division. Furthermore, companies are increasingly expanding their product range and strengthening their market positions through acquisitions and partnerships. For instance, in 2024, Lavie Luxe launched its new 18% fragrance concentration perfume line, featuring four Eau de Parfum fragrances named LUSH, LILY, LAGOON, and LOVE. Consumers are increasingly interested in luxury goods that are designed with circular economic principles, such as those that can be easily upcycled. Gucci was the first luxury brand to use ECONYL recycled nylon in ready-wear pieces, which is a 100% recycled nylon derived from fishing nets, textile waste, and a thick pile fabric used for carpets and upholstery. Luxury brands have increasingly adopted online approaches to meet evolving consumer expectations. For instance, in 2023, Dior was the most popular luxury brand online because of its strategic investments in digital marketing, e-commerce, and social media engagement. This approach helped the brand to engage a wider audience, which has boosted its online sales, especially in markets like China and the US. Brands strategically position themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops in places like Bali and Phuket. It has created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. Hence, such factors are supporting the demand for the personal luxury goods market across emerging nations. As the global economies continue to grow, disposable income levels rise, leading to increased spending on luxury items like footwear. Consumers are increasingly inclined towards luxury footwear because of changing lifestyles and fashion trends. Luxury footwear companies are focusing on the growing consumer base in developing countries such as India and other Southeast Asian countries, where wealth and demand for luxury goods are rising. In 2022, Louis Vuitton introduced its exclusive footwear collection for the Indian market, which features new colors like Rani Pink and glittering designs for celebrating India's cultural heritage. Urbanization in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia continues to drive demand for the personal luxury goods market. In India, platforms like Luxepolis have significantly supported the development of the market by offering new and pre-owned luxury items to a growing audience in smaller cities, as the growing urban population increases the demand for high-end items. Brands are strategically positioning themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops to places like Bali and Phuket. Additionally, collaborations between fashion houses and hospitality venues such as Fendi's beach club in Marbella have created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS The disruption in the supply chain has led to increased costs for raw materials, logistics, and transportation, which have raised operational costs and are often passed on to end consumers which leading to higher luxury goods prices. The focus on limited production to maintain exclusivity significantly raises the production costs for luxury brands. Brands often face higher unit costs for manufacturing, sourcing premium materials, and utilizing skilled labor for producing limited edition items. This limits scalability and hampers the personal luxury goods market demand. Furthermore, major brands occasionally face backlash for products or marketing campaigns, such as Louis Vuitton for selling a scarf inspired by the Palestinian keffiyeh and a jacket that seems to present Jamaican culture by using the country's flags but incorrectly represented. These factors hamper the brand value and show the need for careful consideration in global marketing efforts. PERSONAL LUXURY GOODS MARKET GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS The APAC region dominated the global personal luxury goods market, accounting for a share of over 38% in 2024. APAC is experiencing a surge in urbanization and rising disposable income, particularly in countries like China, India, and Southeast Asian countries. A growing middle and upper-middle class is driving demand for luxury goods as markers of status, success, and aspiration. As consumers become more brand-conscious, luxury ownership is increasingly viewed as a symbol of achievement...."

Well I forgive you because a shitty adult made you do it” P3 was dark and P4 was dark while having that contrast with teddy as a mascot but also having a more kind of celebrity feel to it, P5 while the most aesthetically pleasing and had some really fun new mechanics is lacking in storytelling and dialogue heavily when it comes to certain topics and situations.

The fact that P3 reload came out kind of compounded that for me, I like the story, characters and dialogue alot more than P5s and the visuals have now been updated to match P5 so it's kinda overshadowed in some regards. P4 hands down has the best story by far with the murder mystery plot."

mov_E95556420F829992AA0DDB2EBAA38DDF,2025-07-01 15:32:23,en,WEB,"  I reread ""The Cloud Sculptors of Coral-D"" by J.G. Ballard because my short story reading group is reading The Best Fantasy from The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction. Inclusion in this volume suggests its fantasy. However, it was also included in The Great Science Fiction Series edited by Martin H. Greenberg, Joseph Olander, and Frederik Pohl. The story contains no magic, no dragons or elves, and it's set in our present day, but in a fictional resort called Vermillion Sands. Vermillion Sands feels like a decadent playground for the rich, which also features the many kinds of parasites that live off the wealthy. It's also an artist and expat colony. We don't know its location, but it feels like Palm Springs, California. Many worldly travelers come and go there. ""The Cloud Sculptors of Coral-D"" was my first introduction to J. G. Ballard back in the 1960s. Other stories from that setting make up the series, collected into Vermillion Sands. ""Prima Belladonna"" (Science Fantasy, December 1956)     ""Venus Smiles"" (Science Fantasy, June 1957)    ""Studio 5, the Stars"" (Science Fantasy, February 1961)    ""The Thousand Dreams of Stellavista"" (Amazing Stories, March 1962)    ""The Singing Statues"" (Fantastic Stories, July 1962) (not in original collection)    ""The Screen Game"" (Fantastic Stories, October 1963)    ""Cry Hope, Cry Fury!"" (F&SF, October 1967)    ""The Cloud-Sculptors of Coral D"" (F&SF, December 1967)    ""Say Goodbye to the Wind"" (Fantastic, August 1970)      When I first read ""The Cloud Sculptors of Coral-D"" as a teen, it felt very grown-up to me. The characters were the kinds of people I met growing up in Miami, not the typical heroes of science fiction stories I spent so much time reading. It never occurred to me to think of the story as fantasy, but it didn't seem like science fiction either. At the time, I was just discovering British science fiction writers like Brian Aldiss and John Brunner and the New Wave SF. The stories were set in the present or near future and took place on Earth. No rockets or robots. Was this actual science fiction? ""The Cloud Sculptors of Coral-D"" is about a band of glider pilots who shape clouds with silver iodide. At first, their audience and patrons are people who park their cars along the lagoon road to watch. Eventually, the Garbo-like Leonora Chanel hires them to perform for her party. Sculpting clouds is a neat idea, but far from realistic. Does that make the story science fiction? Ballard does throw in a creature called sand rays, which I suppose are like manta rays that live under the sand instead of the sea. Do they make the story a fantasy? Science fiction has often been the dumping ground for any kind of weird story that can't be classified. The Vermillion Sands stories would have been rejected by mainstream and literary magazines. They fit nicely in The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. They were also published in the British magazine Science Fantasy and the American Fantastic. Only one was published in a straight-ahead science fiction magazine, Amazing Stories. I doubt John W. Campbell would have accepted them in Astounding or Analog. Nor would he have published them in Unknown. I wonder if Rod Serling would have used ""The Cloud Sculptors of Coral-D"" for The Twilight Zone? I'm not fond of traditional fantasy, and many of the stories in The Best Fantasy from The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction aren't enjoyable for me to read. But I did enjoy ""The Cloud Sculptors of Coral-D."" The story has a pleasant, surreal feel. The setting is very close to this world, but just a smidge off. I love the artist colony atmosphere, the hint of decadence, the ever-so-slight sense of unreality. The story combines barnstorming, carny folks, and the ugly rich. I visualize it as a cross between early Faulkner and Fellini. The shortest description would be to say the story has atmosphere. James Wallace Harris, 7/1/25"

Wouldn't it make more sense to have another attorney (someone suggested Trask) that he collaborates with and then take the stand in Johnny's defense? EJ and Chanel are so nasty to each other. And it's getting pretty annoying that Johnny may tell EJ to not be an ass, but then winds up siding with EJ anyway. I don't know, but I think I'd get a little annoyed with my spouse always telling me, ""Thanks, but I'm going to the opposite of what you think."" Amy realllllly isn't reading the room, lol. I don't blame Sophia for not wanting to go on a family outing, pregnant or not. Rachel is a different kid when she's with Brady. She seems more grounded. I laughed when she made Kristen and Brady apologize to each other. She's much more mature than either of them. Family movie night annoyed the crap out of me, though. Kristen's constant giggly laugh grates on my nerves because I can't tell if she thinks she's flirting with Brady or if it's a symptom of her undiagnosed mental illness. Please Soap Jesus, I'm begging you, end this stupid D3/Holly/Ari/loan-shark-bad-guys story! It's weird--they either spend too much time on that story or not enough. Seriously, I had completely forgotten D3 existed until he was onscreen today. That's not promising for his character."

Carryable Collection Things To Know Before You Buy I never ever believed I 'd be one to be blogging about my experience buying an utilized developer bag online. Utilized bag yes, however developer that appeared to be something unreachable even at resale costs and didn't appear like a great use of my purchase.

I recognize I am not the just one that says they'll get specific points, go on specific trips, relocate to particular cities when they win the lottery. And I know I am not the only one who says such things and never plays the lotto! On that checklist for me was a Balenciaga City bag. Our Carryable Collection Statements As a matter of fact, undergo my archives from the 2000's and very early 2010's and you'll see plenty of bags inspired by the Balenciaga City bag and I do not still own a solitary one since none of them were right. I constantly wanted the genuine point. Some desire a Chanel bag, some desire Louis Vuitton I wanted Balenciaga. I was invited to a fashion event at a shopping mall in the area and I was worried. Stressed concerning what to use, emphasized regarding just how to act (I hadn't been to lots of occasions), emphasized concerning getting there on schedule (new moms don't have much control over their bodies or their routines). I entered into the department store closest to where I parked Nieman Marcus.

An Unbiased View of Carryable Collection My daughter no more requires me to lug anything for her in my bag. After 2 years of this pandemic and four years of working from home, I just make use of smaller sized bags due to the fact that I carry much less.

This bag was a present from the brand name numerous years back. Pre-pandemic I carried it now and then.

According to Reddit discussions and a viral TikTok video, the disc isn't being recognized by certain players, including some car stereos, traditional systems, and boomboxes. The playback issue could be caused by the clear disc's manufacturing process, which uses a different kind of reflective layer than the typical aluminum in a standard CD. This variation can cause the lasers in some players to fail to read the disc's data properly. Get Lorde Tickets Here Some Redditors have shared that they were able to play their transparent Virgin CD by switching from a player with a clear lid to a tray-loading model. However, this solution has not worked for everyone, and playback results seem to vary by user and device. Related Video Separately, fans have also noted that this physical CD release is a marked departure from Lorde's previous album, Solar Power, for which she created “an environmentally kind, forward-thinking alternative to the CD.” In other Lorde news, the Kiwi singer will kick off the North American leg of her “Ultrasound” tour in September, which will be followed by dates in the UK and Europe.

Dressed in a sheer baby blue Chanel ensemble, a very pregnant Rih shared with Capital FM her current go-to karaoke song — naming Mariah The Scientist's “Burning Blue” ballad. The 37-year-old singer and business mogul paused for a moment, then smiled as she revealed her pick. “Oh my gosh, it's, it's, it's … maybe 'Burning Blue' by Mariah the Scientist,” she shared with a laugh. The emotional ballad released in May as the lead single from Mariah's upcoming fourth studio album, and the track has already made waves at No. 38 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart. The premiere not only drew attention to Rihanna and her baby bump, but A$AP Rocky as well, who seemingly spilled the beans on their growing family. During an interview with Entertainment Tonight, Rocky hinted at the sex of their unborn child. When asked if the “girl” he had been waiting for had arrived, the Harlemite smiled and gestured to a Smurfette toy, saying, “It is, man, it is.” When Rihanna was asked the same question later, she played it coy, teasing, “Let's see if it's a Smurfette! I don't know! Could be a Papa Smurf! Who knows!” Both are already parents to two sons RZA, 3, and Riot, 1. Rihanna also spoke on whether the baby's name would follow the family tradition and start with an R like her sons RZA and Riot, the “Lift Me Up” singer confirmed: “It's always going to be an R name — that's the one thing me and Rocky don't fight over.” Take a look at Rihanna shouting out Mariah The Scientist's “Burning Blue” song and speaking on her and A$AP Rocky's third child. Smurfs opens in theaters on July 18."

Marc Jacobs gioca un campionato tutto suo. Se ne infischia dei tempi della moda e, soprattutto, della sua commerciabilità. La sua collezione Runway si acquista solo da Bergdorf Goodman, con prezzi del cartellino che corrispondono alla quantità di lavoro necessaria per confezionarla, nonché alla sua reperibilità. Limitata. Pochi pezzi, come i 19 che sfilano alla New York Public Library in cinque minuti di show, una passeggiata rispetto alle attese faraoniche e alle line-up dense dei soliti défilé. In pedana, capi che nessuno (o quasi) indosserà mai: cargo spropositati, bluse imbottite che paiono un'armatura, abiti con pannier non adatti a chi soffre di dismorfofobia corporea, gonne alla gigot con faux cul ottocenteschi, stivaletti vittoriani zavorrati a terra da maxi-plateau, abiti in pizzo doppiato di PVC a mostrare lo scheletro sottostante. “La motivazione alla base di ciò che faccio ora, e che facevo allora – ha raccontato il designer qualche tempo fa sulle pagine del Financial Times –, è la stessa. E cioè fare moda. Dico al mio piccolo team, che è molto, molto piccolo, che abbiamo un solo compito che è quello di intrattenere. Non abbiamo necessità di nascondere in collezione una felpa. Non dobbiamo fare nulla di tutto ciò. Se è una nostra scelta, va bene. Quindi siamo davvero liberi”. La sfilata di Marc Jacobs di soli 3 minuti Courage. Nel castello delle bambole di Marc Jacobs Perché il fashion show di Marc Jacobs sarà da ricordare Svincolati da regole d'indosso, scevri dalla schiavitù dei calendari, immuni alla macchina dell'hype che vorrebbe teasing come rebus su cui spaccarsi il cranio. No, a Marc Jacobs basta un breve video ASMR in cui picchietta le sue lunghe unghie sul tavolo, tra i rocchetti e le macchine da cucire dell'atelier, per annunciare la sua imminente passerella. Che parla di bellezza ossia, come si legge nelle note dello show; “Una qualità o una combinazione di qualità che dà piacere alla mente o ai sensi ed è spesso associata a proprietà come l'armonia della forma o del colore, la proporzione e l'autenticità”. Spesso, ma non nella pedana dello stilista che, come ci ha abituato da qualche stagione a questa parte, di equilibri ne mantiene ben pochi e del resto dell'ovvietà, a lui, non è mai interessato granché. Ecco allora sfilare le solite bambole con un guardaroba che, questa volta, sembra una crasi tra vittorianesimo e grunge. Linee tournure che si prendono la licenza poetica di accentuare il derrière così come il punto vita, un profluvio di passamaneria in guisa di fiocchi giganti posizionati un po' ovunque – acconciature comprese –, volumi sbuffanti e imbottiture smodate, torsioni e sagomature come non ci fosse un domani, stratificazioni alle bell'e meglio tra pizzi e satin floreali di improbabili sottovesti, tra corpetti, reggiseni e un Niagara di catene posticce da far impallidire Coco Chanel. Il pantalone cargo raddoppia le tasche, il jeans ha pinces enormi in cui infilare le mani, la blusa in pizzo è ad aria compressa e le sorties del bal, per scippare un termine al tardo Ottocento, sono opere couture e gargantuesche. “Sono le cose che non sono comunemente riconosciute come belle quelle che trovo maggiormente attraenti”, disse una volta Jacobs, il più imprevedibile dei designer Made in USA che ha fatto del meticciato tra alta moda e street culture, tra vecchio e nuovo, tra provocazione e analisi puntuali sullo Zeitgeist, il suo credo stilistico. E qui, nella sua passerella dedicata all'Autunno Inverno 2025 2026, questi elementi paiono esserci tutti: dalle sovrapposizioni improbabili che agganciano la fantasia al '92 di Perry Ellis e ai suoi look trasandati tra flanella e anfibi che gli costarono il posto, al ripasso di storia della moda che al momento è tic di tutti, all'esagerazione di “corpi aumentati” su cui si può leggere (come no) una stoccata a quelli plastici che tanto vanno, piallati dall'Ozempic e poi aumentati nei punti giusti. O ancora, in tempi di cautela e pedane alle volte senza brivido, la ferocia creativa che sfida le regole della portabilità, un passo traballante alla volta, su stivaletti stringati dalla punta all'insù, fasciate di stoffe botaniche sovrasviluppate, in una celebrazione di un eccesso onirico che può farsi via di fuga, seppur breve, da un presente funesto. Come ha sottolineato Jacobs in una recente intervista a WWD: “La moda è davvero speciale ed è qualcosa di cui non si ha bisogno. Non è un semplice pezzo di stoffa per coprire il corpo. È qualcosa che tocca il cuore”. La sua, certamente. GLI ESSENZIALI Su AMAZON Su AMAZON Su AMAZON Su AMAZON"

Camilla fue uno de ellos hace cuarenta años, pero con la diferencia de que resolvió quedarse aquí e instalarse en el último petit-hotel aun de pie en la Isla, ese espacio de la ciudad próximo a Recoleta, y en cuya parte más alta se asienta la embajada británica. Estuvo entre nosotros hasta que la salud quebrantada desde hacía seis años determinó que volviera a la residencia que mantenía abierta en Londres, aparte de otra más que conservaba en Salamanca, Madrid. Falleció el domingo último en el Kings College Hospital, como consecuencia inmediata de la neumonía que no soportó el cuerpo ya estragado por una grave enfermedad hematológica. Las especulaciones sobre el concepto de belleza femenina se remontan por lo menos a los tiempos de Helena de Troya en un vasto abanico de conclusiones, como es del caso en asuntos renuentes a ceñirse a un solo un tipo de mirada. Hay, con todo, un posible concierto final de juicios sobre el carácter supremo de belleza femenina. Es cuando además se aúnan, en una misma mujer, la sensibilidad que brota a un tiempo del corazón, la distinción que es obra de la educación esmerada y de la aristocracia natural del alma, y de la energía que logra trasuntarse sin estrépito en compasión y entrega generosa a la amistad y a la realización de las mejores causas en la sociedad que se integra. Todo eso exornaba la personalidad excepcional de esta mujer a quien sobraban de muchacha los atributos implícitos en “Confesión”, el tango con letra de Discépolo y Amadori, tarareado por generaciones de porteños. Al verte, “¡Se paraban pa mirarte!” . PUBLICIDAD En realidad, Camilla no era Camilla Mackeson, sino Camilla Keith. Llevó hasta el final el apellido de su primer esposo, el barón Rupert Mackeson, un militar de la guardia real a cuya rudeza primitiva se atribuye la separación de ambos al cabo de pocos años de casarse. Camilla provenía de la casa de los Keith, un linaje escocés, de Aberdeen, del que existen constancias a partir de 1196. Algo así como 400 años antes de que la reina María Estuardo fuera confinada en sucesivos castillos por Isabel I y, finalmente, ejecutada. Camilla fue una figura activa en el movimiento filantrópico que ha contribuido, con aportes privados, al desenvolvimiento del Teatro Colón, del Centro Cultural Borges y, en modo muy particular respecto de ella, al Teatro San Martín. Por años se ejercitó en el arte de la pintura en el taller de María Silvia Corcuera. Su casa de cuatro pisos, en la cortada de Copérnico, estuvo abierta infinidad de veces a la recepción de un mundo de gentes. Sabía, como pocas, el arduo oficio del anfitrión, y armonizaba así, en cada ocasión, los grupos de invitados, entre los que se entrecruzaban en la conversación, de modo grato para todos, escritores, diplomáticos, políticos, artistas, empresarios, críticos de arte y periodistas especializados en las generalizaciones del oficio. También los buenos gourmets se retiraban de sus comidas, poco habituales en Buenos Aires hoy, con un incontenible: “Oh, la, la”. Camilla era hija de Alister Keith, banquero que presidió el Hill Samuels y la Rolls Royce Aviation. Durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial había sido un oficial de extrema confianza para la Corona Británica. En tal carácter integró el Estado Mayor del comando supremo de los Ejércitos Aliados, del general Dwight Eisenhower. Una foto en blanco y negro, fechada el 7 de junio de 1945, colocada sobre el piano de cola de su hija Camilla en la casa de Copérnico, mostraba a Alistar Keith a espaldas de los jefes aliados, mientras el general Alfred Jodl firmaba en Reims, en escena memorable, y en nombre del precario sucesor de Hitler, el almirante Donitz, la rendición incondicional del Ejército alemán. Llegaba a su fin en Europa la enorme conflagración de seis años. PUBLICIDAD La leyenda vinculaba a Alistair Keith con los servicios de inteligencia militar británicos. Hace unos años, al morir, el Times publicó un obituario con el sugestivo título de The military man of the City, en obvia conexión con dos influencias convergentes. Antes de instalarse en Buenos Aires, Camilla vivió varios años en Nueva York. Era la persona indicada para triunfar allí como relacionista pública de Chanel, primero, y de Vuitton y Valentino, después. Se afincó a renglón seguido de ese período en Brasil, rodeada del afecto de una pareja de alemanes con relaciones en diversas partes del mundo, como eran Herbert y Dudu von Tillman, dos de las caras visibles en la región de la industria química Hoechst. Ambos la impulsaron a venir a Buenos Aires. El último y largo romance de Camilla fue con un diplomático de carrera argentino, Roberto Villambrosa, quien contó con una confianza especial del presidente Alfonsín y con ninguna, afortunadamente, del presidente Chávez cuando fue embajador en Caracas. Roberto acompañó a Camilla con devoción hasta sus últimos días. Ambos habían contraído matrimonio en Asunción, en 2010, impulsados a hacerlo en esa capital por el entonces embajador argentino, Félix Córdova Moyano, amigo de la pareja. En una dama de aristas tan singulares como Camilla no era de extrañar que una tarde, tomando el té, en el Claridge de Londres, como efectivamente ocurrió, entraran Henry Kissinger y su mujer, la vieran y se detuvieran a saludarla. La semana próxima se hará en su memoria el servicio religioso, por rito anglicano, en Castle Acre, en cuyo predio recibirá sepultura, justo al lado de los restos de su padre. Lady Camilla Mackeson, Keith, había nacido el 7 de marzo de 1947, en Londres."

mov_B315F688FF1A80C9D19D81A3DC7B0D07,2025-07-01 21:59:32,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Inicio / Redacción / CAMBIO 22 Desde los primeros días luego de su estreno, la conversación en internet sobre Mentiras, la serie, se ha centrado en el vestuario que lleva Belinda. Y los rumores son ciertos: las piezas de archivo de marcas de lujo como Hermès, Louis Vuitton, Versace, Chanel y Dolce & Gabbana, que tienen a todos los creadores de contenido de moda comentando y especulando, sí son de su propio armario. Pero no hay que dejarse engañar por las apariencias… Mientras la historia de Mentiras de Amazon Prime Video se va desarrollando, hay una línea muy difusa entre las piezas que Belinda prestó de su clóset, y las que quedaron a manos de Claudia Sandoval, la diseñadora de vestuario responsable de recrear la moda de los años 80 que llevan la intérprete de Daniela y los demás personajes de la adaptación del emblemático musical. Pero también ha sido la encargada de crearles una identidad que se refleje a través de la ropa. Y esa no ha sido una tarea fácil. “Hay detrás una investigación súper pesada, aquí estamos los personajes más a fondo. Era una obra de dos horas y ahora son ocho capítulos”, comenta. Esta labor implica cuestionarse todo acerca del personaje, desde quién es, hasta quiénes son sus papás y por qué viste lo que viste. El vestuario de Belinda en Mentiras, la serie “Las pruebas de vestuario eran de horas y horas. Hubo una colaboración, porque ella, como todos los actores, tiene un punto de vista de su personaje”. Y así es como se empatan las necesidades técnicas de la producción, que incluye cómo el vestuario se va a ver en los sets, con la visión que el actor tiene sobre su propio rol. Con Belinda, particularmente, uno de los retos era empatar su agenda con las horas de las pruebas de vestuario, pues al mismo tiempo estaba trabajando en el lanzamiento de su álbum Indómita. “Daniela, si no me equivoco, tiene como 38 cambios en la serie”. Aunque en un giro inesperado y algo inusual, la actriz le abrió las puertas de su clóset a Sandoval, pues sabía que tenía algunas piezas que seguro encajarían con su personaje. “Beli tiene unas prendas como de museo, es increíble”. Entre ellas vimos un abrigo rojo en forma de corazón que Hedi Slimane diseñó para la pasarela ready-to-wear, otoño-invierno 2016, precisamente una colección inspirada en la moda de los 80, además de un bolso de edición limitada de Louis Vuitton, que se distingue por las plumas rosa, y también una camisa y pantalones de Versace que lleva de pijama, sin dejar de mencionar un vestido Blumarine, entre otras icónicas piezas, como su bolsa color rosa palo de Hermès. “Hay muchos momentos muy pequeñitos en donde sale Daniela, donde aparecen muchos de sus cambios, como el flashback del avión y el de la alfombra roja. Y esos momentos eran perfectos para que ella nos ayudara con cosas de su clóset que eran espectaculares”. Luego estaba “el cambio héroe”, el cambio principal que es el que usa en toda la mansión Mijares. “El rosa, ¿no? , el de Chanel”, ingenuamente me atreví a decir. “¡No es Chanel, lo hicimos!” , me responde Claudia. En términos de producción, necesitaban un traje que Belinda pudiera llevar en la escena más larga, la que va sosteniendo el hilo de la historia. Así que tenía que ser un traje reconocible. “El traje Chanel que todos reconocemos, si no es por Jackie Kennedy, es por Marge Simpson”. Un look clásico y perfecto, que fácilmente se podía colar como otra de las piezas más delicadas de Belinda. “Ese tweed lo mandamos a traer de Nueva York, nos mandaron varios, y ese fue el que se terminó quedando una vez que hicimos pruebas de cámara para ver también cómo se veía. Teníamos tres igualitos, que se los íbamos cambiando”. Cuando hablamos de la inspiración de la estética de cuando Daniela era joven, salen a relucir películas como Heather y Clueless cuando se siente un poco más hacia los años 90. Había ropa de los ochenta que era original, pero el reto era llevarlo al universo rosa de Daniela, así que en diseño de vestuario se recrearon a partir de patrones originales de piezas de la época, pero con los colores de Daniela. “Pero también siempre estaba el reto de hacer que tuviera sentido, y de que Daniela no nada más tenía estilo por vestirse de marca. Daniela tenía estilo porque tenía estilo, ¿sabes?” . La diseñadora de vestuario de Mentiras, la serie Claudia Sandoval es la diseñadora de vestuario de Mentiras, la serie de Amazon Prime Video. Su trayectoria comenzó como estudiante de modas en Centro. Al terminar sus estudios, se fue a Nueva York a continuar estudiando y allá comenzó a trabajar en sus primeros proyectos junto a Ana Terrazas, con quien siguió su camino como supervisora de vestuario en películas como Roma de Alfonso Cuarón y Bardo de Alejandro González Iñárritu. A diferencia de las producciones de Hollywood, la profesión de vestuaristas de cine en Latinoamérica ha sido un rol mucho menos mediático. La sensación es que esta labor no ha recibido el reconocimiento que merece. Para Claudia Sandoval, su trabajo comienza por una “investigación del vestuario y de cómo se usaba y por qué se usaba así, y de cómo en México llegaban siempre como un poquito más atrasadas las tendencias, entonces de repente puedes ver algo muy ochentero, pero ya son los noventas”. En Mentiras, Belinda recuperó la moda de los 80, pero cada uno de los personajes también tenían algo que decir. Solo hace falta observar. “Fue muy interesante encontrar otras cosas para darles a los personajes su personalidad, por ejemplo, Yuri siempre trae algo de piel porque ella es muy hermética con sus sentimientos, con sus emociones, y se viste así porque es su segunda piel que la está protegiendo de todo este secreto enorme que se carga; Lupita, cuando llega a la mansión, es la que más capas lleva. Y si ves toda la parte de la mansión, cuando van como sacando los secretos, en cámara se va quitando capas”. Al final, todo es “cómo la ropa habla a través de nosotros, cómo somos una extensión de todo a través de la ropa, y eso usarlo como herramienta para ayudarles a las actrices a meterse a la piel del personaje”.

Am 1. Juli ist eine frühere Villa des Modezaren im französischen Louveciennes versteigert worden - für ein Mindestgebot von 4.685.000 Euro. Das frühere Jagdschloss in Louveciennes liegt rund 20 Kilometer westlich von Paris und besteht aus einem Haupthaus und Nebengebäuden mit rund 600 Quadratmetern Wohnfläche. Im Immobilieninserat wird es als ""schönes neoklassizistisches bürgerliches Herrenhaus"" beschrieben. Zudem gebe es einen Pool mit Poolhaus, einen Tennisplatz, zwei Gästehäuser, einen einst als Atelier genutzten Raum, eine hauseigene Bibliothek und einen Aufzug über alle Etagen. Auch einen Weinkeller soll es dort geben. Lagerfeld soll in der Villa nur eine Nacht geschlafen haben Laut des Fernsehmagazins ""Brisant"" soll Karl Lagerfeld in der Villa selbst nur eine Nacht verbracht haben. Vor rund drei Jahren wurde das liebevoll renovierte Anwesen laut ""Bild""-Zeitung an einen Investoren verkauft und landete jetzt in einer Auktion. Der Käufer ist unbekannt. Ein Pariser Apartment des ehemaligen Chefdesigners von Chanel war bereits im letzten Jahr unter den Hammer gekommen. In nur 19 Minuten sei die 260 Quadratmeter große Wohnung Lagerfelds, die laut ""Brisant"" ursprünglich auf 5,3 Millionen Euro geschätzt worden war, für rund das Doppelte an einen neuen Besitzer gegangen. Karl Lagerfeld lebte in der Wohnung, die er Berichten zufolge in einem futuristischen Stil gestalten ließ, etwa zehn Jahre. Der Modeschöpfer starb am 19. Februar 2019 im Alter von 85 Jahren in Paris. Die Stadt ist eng mit seiner Karriere verbunden."

Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ. Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính. Nó là biểu tượng của một thách thức toàn cầu: khi hàng giả ngày càng tinh vi, thương mại điện tử ngày càng phát triển, và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng ngày càng dễ bị lợi dụng. Mỗi cú nhấp chuột mua hàng mà không kiểm chứng nguồn gốc có thể tiếp tay cho một đường dây tội phạm khổng lồ đang hoạt động ngay giữa lòng đô thị văn minh. Và mỗi vụ án được bóc trần – như đế chế hàng hiệu giả 1 tỷ đô ở Manhattan – là lời nhắc nhở rằng: cuộc chiến chống hàng giả chưa bao giờ đơn giản. Nguồn: Tổng hợp"

I never saw her again after that night, but after all these years have passed, I still think about her, dream about her. I even remember her scent. Imagine my surprise when she reappeared in my life as if she had never left. Well, that's because subconsciously she hadn't. She doesn't know who I really am. Her being here at this moment could only mean one thing, even with all my secrets, and that was that she was mine. Devin Haven thought that once he'd achieved the highest level of success, he'd feel fulfilled. But success wasn't keeping him warm at night. The one woman who could possibly fill that void was the woman from his past he'd sworn would never be his type. Chanel Declan wasn't the woman everyone thought she was. She'd run from her past life to create a new one time and time again. Returning home to get another fresh start leads her back to her past. But this time, she's determined to make it work. Can two people whose past timelines are so closely intertwined make it through the secrets they wove to reach their present?

mov_5EDD834DB7769F9BBB8BCFD4F11305BE,2025-07-02 04:00:00,en,WEB,"  People-watching is one of my favorite pastimes, especially in Jakarta's melting pots of leisure and business, like Plaza Senayan and Ashta. Fancy people, I say to myself. The bags are mostly the usual high-end suspects: black Chanel flaps, Birkins that might or might not be real, old-time favorite Neverfulls. Predictable. But lately, something has been shifting. Increasingly, I see statement pieces from homegrown designers: Peggy Hartanto's signature heart appliqué on a chic woman. Sapto Djojokartiko's fluid silhouettes and intricate embroidery on almost-sheer fabric. TOTON's soft, floral lace kebaya tops darting between brunches and galas. ArtKea's boxy striped shirts blending in with the city's creative-casual crowd. There are no obvious logos, but you just know these brands cost money. And those who know, know. Homegrown, high-end Jakarta's fashion scene is evolving, and so are its shoppers. This city, where cultures collide and creativity thrives, has become a breeding ground for a new kind of luxury—local, deeply personal and proudly embraced by its own. Coming to you every other Friday From lifestyle trends to cultural insights, The Weekender brings you quality stories and inspiring narratives to elevate your pop-culture knowledge in niche topics, including arts, well-being, environment, technology and everything in between. For signing up to our newsletter. Please check your email for your newsletter subscription. Take Bogar, 34, a start-up exec with a thing for elevated basics. He often turns to local brands for his rotation, especially those created by friends, like ANW, where he looks for elevated basics that still reflect his personal style, but with a distinct accent or twist. Outside his circle, he is drawn to high-end ready-to-wear labels like Art Kea and Jan Sober. “Why local? Practicality,” he shrugs. “Because I'm stingy. I really care about cost per wear. A lot of the foreign stuff wears out too quickly. I just can't justify it.” Still, there's more to the shift than economics. In Jakarta, local luxury has become something of a secret handshake—recognizable only to those in the know. Bogar points to names like Sapto Djojokartiko, which he sees as a new kind of status symbol. “It's not just about the design. It's the identity, the craft, the prestige of being seen at their events. You're part of a coveted circle,” he says. Distry, 32, an art professional and former luxury watch insider, agrees. “Luxury isn't just about the high price,” she tells me. “It's about limited access and ownership. Many people have money, so it's not just about whether you can afford it, but whether you can get it. Rarity and exclusivity are the real markers of luxury.” Like Bogar, Distry is a firm believer in local luxury, not out of obligation, but appreciation. “I'm not trying to sound nationalistic, but I genuinely feel proud when I wear an Indonesian designer,” she says. “It also feels more exclusive than global luxury brands. It's amazing that Indonesia now has its own version of Chanel or Hermès. In ready-to-wear alone, we have Biyan, TOTON, Sapto Djojokartiko, Peggy Hartanto and more.” Their craftsmanship, she insists, is on a whole other level. “TOTON is my favorite—and pricewise, I think it makes the most sense. For me, TOTON is art, while Peggy Hartanto is a well-made, ready-to-wear label. And Biyan? That's still an aspiration, for now.” The city in the craft One aspect that sets these brands apart is how they do not just say they come from Jakarta, but the city itself is in the fabric of the work...."

In previous post was one person whom commented on it, look it up please. I know both Russian and English language, and it's actually ridiculous how it was mistranslated without a context. The closest translation of the whole meme is something like this: "" You will be finding yourself in the wh*r*s of Turkey"" - it's a derogatory meme, which was actually used towards author of the chanel (Telegram chanel). Not towards any Turkish people, but towards author of the chanel herself. Like, she is such a bad person in this situation from the Turkish fandom point of view, that she will find information about herself in Turkish social media because of how bad is she - people will twist the words out of context to make her seems even worse of a person. Like you doing now, for example, you basically proving this meme by posting wrong translation of it. You didn't know that it's a meme because you don't know Russian language and it's okay. But it's actually a tiny bit funny how ironic this is. Moral of the story: do not use translation programms. It's better to learn language that using this kind of programs, because at least you will be aware of memes that exist in other languages. There are lot of stuff which you can't translate word by word from English to Russian, from English to Turkish, from Turkish to Russian and this is one of them. Hope I didn't came out rude. Have a great day."

Một báo cáo gây sốc từ tổ chức phi chính phủ Earthsight của Anh vừa phơi bày một sự thật đau lòng: Đằng sau những chiếc túi xách hàng hiệu xa xỉ của các nhà mốt danh tiếng như Hugo Boss, Chanel hay LVMH là nạn phá rừng bất hợp pháp quy mô lớn tại Amazon - ""lá phổi xanh "" của hành tinh. Tháng 11-2025, Hội nghị lần thứ 30 các Bên tham gia Công ước Khung của Liên Hợp Quốc về Biến đổi khí hậu (COP30) sẽ được tổ chức tại Brazil - quốc gia sở hữu phần lớn rừng Amazon. Đây là lần đầu tiên sự kiện khí hậu trọng đại này chính thức đưa vấn đề rừng nhiệt đới vào chương trình nghị sự, trong bối cảnh các cánh rừng tại Amazon đang đối mặt với nguy cơ bị tàn phá nghiêm trọng bởi nhiều nguyên nhân, từ việc trồng đậu nành, các vụ cháy rừng, cho đến một nguyên nhân gián tiếp ít ai nghĩ đến: Ngành công nghiệp da. Mối liên hệ giữa da thuộc xa xỉ và nạn phá rừng Theo báo cáo của Earthsight, da được sử dụng để chế tác những chiếc túi xách sang trọng bậc nhất lại có nguồn gốc từ hoạt động chăn nuôi gia súc bất hợp pháp tại khu vực Amazon. Điều đáng báo động là chăn nuôi gia súc chính là nguyên nhân hàng đầu gây ra nạn phá rừng quy mô lớn trong những năm gần đây tại vùng đất này. Để làm rõ sự việc, Earthsight đã tiến hành một cuộc điều tra toàn diện, bao gồm phân tích tài liệu pháp lý, dữ liệu thương mại, hình ảnh vệ tinh và thậm chí là điều tra bí mật tại các nhà thuộc da ở Italy. Kết quả cho thấy sự liên đới rõ ràng của nhiều thương hiệu lớn trong chuỗi cung ứng đầy rủi ro này. Báo cáo đặc biệt nhấn mạnh hoạt động chăn nuôi gia súc bất hợp pháp tại bang Pará, phía Bắc Brazil. Tại đây, một khu vực rộng gần gấp đôi diện tích Bồ Đào Nha đã bị thiêu rụi trong vòng 20 năm qua. Sau khi được giết mổ, da của những con gia súc được chuyển đến hai nhà thuộc da của Italy là Conceria Cristina và Faeda. Đáng chú ý, hai nhà thuộc da này là đối tác thường xuyên của các thương hiệu thời trang cao cấp. Những tên tuổi lớn bị điểm mặt Coach, thương hiệu thời trang Mỹ nổi tiếng với những chiếc túi xách sang trọng ""dễ tiếp cận "", có giá bán từ 300-600 euro (350,42 - 700,84 USD) và đang hướng đến thế hệ trẻ, được xác định là một trong những khách hàng của hai nhà thuộc da trên. Không chỉ Coach, Earthsight còn điểm mặt nhiều thương hiệu danh tiếng khác cũng mua da từ Conceria Cristina và Faeda, bao gồm: Chanel, Chloé, Hugo Boss, Fendi và Louis Vuitton (thuộc tập đoàn LVMH), cùng với Balenciaga, Gucci và Saint Laurent (thuộc tập đoàn Kering). Mặc dù tất cả các thương hiệu trên đều phủ nhận việc sử dụng da từ Brazil, nhưng sau khi nhận thông báo về cuộc điều tra, một số đã nhanh chóng khởi động các cuộc điều tra nội bộ, trong khi số khác cung cấp thông tin về nguồn gốc da của họ cho Earthsight. Điều đáng nói, trong khi các cuộc điều tra đang diễn ra, ngành công nghiệp da vẫn tiếp tục vận động hành lang nhằm thoát khỏi các quy định bảo vệ rừng mới của châu Âu, dự kiến có hiệu lực vào cuối năm nay. Thậm chí, một sự kiện đã được tổ chức tại Nghị viện châu Âu (EP) để thúc đẩy lợi ích của họ. Lời kêu gọi hành động Ông Rafael Pieroni, Trưởng nhóm Mỹ Latinh của Earthsight, thẳng thắn bày tỏ sự thất vọng: ""Người tiêu dùng các sản phẩm xa xỉ thường kỳ vọng rằng mức giá cao sẽ đảm bảo họ không góp phần vào nạn phá rừng hay việc chiếm đoạt đất của người bản địa. Cuộc điều tra này cho thấy niềm tin đó đang bị đặt sai chỗ. Chừng nào các thương hiệu thời trang chưa thực hiện đầy đủ trách nhiệm rà soát chuỗi cung ứng của mình, họ sẽ không thể đảm bảo rằng sản phẩm của mình không liên quan đến những hành vi lạm dụng này Vào tháng 1-2026, Quy định Chống Phá rừng của Liên minh châu Âu (EUDR) sẽ chính thức có hiệu lực, buộc các doanh nghiệp phải chứng minh rằng da và các nguyên liệu thô khác mà họ sử dụng ""không liên quan đến nạn phá rừng "". Bà Marie Toussaint, Phó Chủ tịch nhóm Greens/ALE tại EP và là người tham gia xây dựng đạo luật này, nhấn mạnh tầm quan trọng của báo cáo Earthsight. ""Báo cáo của Earthsight đến đúng lúc: Nó tiết lộ rằng ngay cả những nhà mốt lớn của châu Âu cũng có nguy cơ liên quan đến việc phá hủy rừng Amazon "", bà Toussaint cho biết. Theo bà, ""trong bối cảnh cánh hữu và cực hữu đang tìm cách làm suy yếu quy định chống phá rừng của châu Âu, công trình này một lần nữa nhấn mạnh lý do tại sao luật này là cần thiết để bảo vệ quyền con người và các hệ sinh thái. Chúng ta phải thực hiện quy định này một cách đầy đủ và nhanh chóng, để chấm dứt sự đồng lõa thầm lặng giữa tiêu dùng châu Âu và nạn phá rừng Brazil đã cam kết đạt mục tiêu không phá rừng vào năm 2030. Tuy nhiên, với những gì báo cáo của Earthsight phơi bày, con đường để đạt được mục tiêu này vẫn còn nhiều chông gai, đặc biệt khi sự ""lộng lẫy "" của ngành thời trang cao cấp vẫn đang phải trả bằng cái giá quá đắt của những cánh rừng bị tàn phá.

Their small family includes their two daughters, Vlaimel & Vlaishel. Nathalie recapped the month of June with a story on her Instagram. The collage of pictures showcased her two children, alongside a selfie and a picture of herself in front of the Chanel store, a pasta-prawn preparation and two luxury bags. The adorable pictures with her two daughters featured the elder, Vlaimel, having a bowl of spaghetti, while Vlaishel could be seen posing with the Cleveland Guardians mascot during the Blue Jays' visit. While her two daughters were the main focus, Nathalie's 'Chanel' look had a chic feel to it. She could be seen carrying a big bag after her shopping at the store. In a previous Instagram post, she had shared snaps from her day out. Nathalie and Vladimir met online in 2018. The two were together before finally tying the knot in a private ceremony in 2023. Apart from being his biggest supporter at Blue Jays' games, Nathalie also runs the Vladimir Guerrero Jr. Foundation that works in sectors related to sports, education and environment, empowering the youth. As a proud partner, Nathalie has been actively campaigning for fans to vote for All-Star finalist Vladimir Guerrero Jr. alongside catcher Alejandro Kirk. The two Blue Jays players are the only ones to be named the finalists after the first round of All-Star voting. Nathalie has been posting clips and fan interactions related to the All-Star voting on her Instagram stories. Vladimir Guerrero Jr. is up against Paul Goldschmidt of the New York Yankees. Both players have had similar stats so far in the first half of the season. The Blue Jays first baseman is hitting at .278 with 44 RBIs, 12 home runs and .827 OPS, while Goldschmidt is at a .284 pace with 32 RBIs, 11 home runs and .772 OPS. After the first day of voting, the Blue Jays superstar was still in the lead."

a0e1d637eeafdca55a7a71fd2de37eec,2025-07-02 10:43:00,en,WEB,"  Some Lorde fans who purchased a transparent CD copy of her new album, Virgin, are reporting issues with getting it to play. According to Reddit discussions and a viral TikTok video, the disc isn't being recognized by certain players, including some car stereos, traditional systems, and boomboxes. The playback issue could be caused by the clear disc's manufacturing process, which uses a different kind of reflective layer than the typical aluminum in a standard CD. This variation can cause the lasers in some players to fail to read the disc's data properly. Some Redditors have shared that they were able to play their transparent Virgin CD by switching from a player with a clear lid to a tray-loading model. However, this solution has not worked for everyone, and playback results seem to vary by user and device. Separately, fans have also noted that this physical CD release is a marked departure from Lorde's previous album, Solar Power, for which she created “an environmentally kind, forward-thinking alternative to the CD.” In other Lorde news, the Kiwi singer will kick off the North American leg of her “Ultrasound” tour in September, which will be followed by dates in the UK and Europe. See the full list of dates below, and get tickets here. [@elyxirtalkssmack]yeah so the Lorde CD doesn't work on CD players, particularly car ones and walkmans because the design ain't fit for purpose and Lorde doesn't offer any other CD options. So back to JB Hi Fi I'll have to go for a refund. @LordFoxPuppy any way we can get a not clear disc, or do we have permission to burn it onto a disc we can actually read. #[#lorde][#cd][#cdplayer][#music][♬ Man Of The Year – Lorde] https://www.tiktok.com/embed.js Lorde 2025 Tour Dates: 09/17 – Austin, TX @ Moody Center * 09/19 – Chicago, IL @ United Center * 09/20 – Nashville, TN @ The Pinnacle * 09/23 – Columbus, OH @ Schottenstein Center * 09/24 – Toronto, ON @ Scotiabank Arena * 09/26 – Boston, MA @ TD Garden # ! 09/27 – Montreal, QC @ Bell Centre # ! 09/30 – Philadelphia, PA @ Wells Fargo Center # ! 10/01 – New York, NY @ Madison Square Garden * 10/03 – Pittsburgh, PA @ Petersen Events Center * 10/04 – Washington, DC @ The Anthem * 10/05 – Washington, DC @ The Anthem * 10/07 – Duluth, GA @ Gas South Arena * ^ 10/09 – St. Louis, MO @ Chaifetz Arena * ^ 10/10 – Milwaukee, WI @ UW-Milwaukee Panther Arena * ^ 10/11 – Minneapolis, MN @ Armory * ^ 10/14 – Morrison, CO @ Red Rocks Amphitheatre # ! 10/17 – Las Vegas, NV @ MGM Grand Garden Arena # ! 10/18 – Inglewood, CA @ Kia Forum # ! ^ 10/19 – Berkeley, CA @ The Greek Theatre * ^ 10/21 – Portland, OR @ Moda Center * ^ 10/22 – Seattle, WA @ Climate Pledge Arena * ^ 11/09 – Luxembourg, LU @ Rockhal $ 11/10 – Paris, FR @ Zénith de Paris – La Villette % 11/15 – Manchester, UK @ AO Arena # % 11/16 – London, UK @ O2 Arena & % 11/19 – Glasgow, UK @ OVO Hydro & % 11/20 – Birmingham, UK @ Utilitia Arena & % 11/22 – Dublin, IE @ RDS Simmonscourt & % 11/24 – Amsterdam, NL @ AFAS Live & 11/27 – Brussels, BE @ Forest National * 11/29 – Bologna, IT @ Unipol Arena * 11/30 – Zurich, CH @ Halle 622 * 12/01 – Munich, DE @ Zenith *..."

mov_BAF40A2AD5E01049CE1C0065C91FE169,2025-07-02 12:03:10,en,WEB,"  Sofia Coppola made a film about Marie Antoinette—but maybe next, she'll consider Empress Eugénie. Biarritz, the seaside town founded by Eugénie de Montijo, is where Coppola came to celebrate the 25th anniversary of her film The Virgin Suicides as part of the Nouvelles Vagues Festival. Actors, directors, and festivalgoers of all ages gathered at Le Royal, Biarritz's Art Deco cinema, to see and revisit Coppola's exquisitely soaring, tragic film about the five Lisbon sisters, which launched her career in the late 1990s. Coppola's debut film immediately positioned her as one of the most singular and intimate filmmakers of her generation. Its anniversary was an opportunity to talk about the making of the film, its core femininity—linked, she says, to the fact that Coppola grew up mostly around boys—her appreciation for Jane Campion, and even Claude Pinoteau's La Boum, which Coppola saw years after making this film. At the end of the talk, Coppola sat down for an exclusive interview before beginning her summer in France. On July 1, she'll be in Paris for a book signing at 7L, Karl Lagerfeld 's studio-library turned Chanel cultural hub. The following day, she will be in the Cour Carrée du Louvre for a screening as part of the Cinéma Paradiso program. Coppola is also working on the artistic direction of the Bal du Musée des Arts Décoratifs, one of the most eagerly awaited events of Haute Couture Week. Vanity Fair: How does it feel to see Virgin Suicides again? Sofia Coppola: I'm so glad. I saw it recently for the first time in a long time, so I'm glad it holds up. How does the younger generation—those born when you were making the film, or just after— perceive it? It's hard for me to say; you have to ask a young person. The time of daydreaming and becoming who you are through being in your room—I wonder nowadays how young people have that time. I'm sure there's some nostalgia, because there's a lot of stress and pressure with having a phone and social media all the time. I know my younger daughter was like, “Oh, I wish I was around in the '90s.” I think it feels like a burden in some ways. Was it a time you loved? I'm just glad I was young then. You love memorabilia, collections, and archives. Have you ever thought of making a documentary about your mother? I am working on preserving some of her footage that hasn't been seen yet. So I'm working on preserving her archive. She wrote a book that we're working on getting published, and now I'm working on getting her last work out. In this work, there's the idea of transmission toward a new generation, which is also at the heart of the Nouvelles Vagues Festival, where you've just spoken. I thought it was so nice that the focus of this festival is on young filmmakers and young voices. I'm happy to show my first film here, and that it still connects with young people. I want to share my work, and hope to be encouraging if I can. Do you still have a special connection with adolescence? Yeah, I still feel connected to that side. But at this point in my life, I'm also interested in themes of older people. It's so different being a teenager today, but I still have a lot of respect for people that age because it is such a sensitive time. And when I was growing up, the movies that were made for teenagers weren't made with respect to artfulness or whatever. But yeah, I am glad to not be that age. I'm glad to be my age. Does Virgin Suicides occupy a special place in your heart? Yeah. It's my first film. I have a lot of really nice memories. It's also where I met Kirsten Dunst, and we formed our friendship. She's a close collaborator of mine, in my work and also my life. A lot of the people that worked on it, I'm still connected with. But I have a really nice memory of that summer in Toronto, making a low-budget movie and the feeling of everyone helping me. Ed Lachman, the cinematographer, really helped me learn how to develop my language on film. And I didn't know I wanted to be a director until [I read] that book. Is the first film always the most difficult? I think they're always difficult. It was hard to get it made—but when you're young, you're naive, and you don't realize how hard things are. You have a courage that helps you; when you're older, you know what it's going to take...."

""Evite perturbar os jogadores chamando por eles e lembre-se de que a decisão do árbitro é final — nunca interrompa, nem questione os juízes de linha."" Além disso, ""contenha-se"", orienta ele.

É claro que as regras também incluem a vestimenta. E ""a melhor forma de mostrar bom comportamento é se vestir adequadamente"", segundo Windsor. Wimbledon não mantém um código de vestimenta definido, mas é recomendável usar traje formal, especialmente nas quadras principais.

mov_9B4728401C191CFADC9DF372D454973F,2025-07-02 13:39:03,pt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]Nos seus quase 150 anos de história, o torneio de tênis de Wimbledon acumulou e preserva normas implícitas de vestimenta e etiqueta que fazem dele um dos eventos esportivos mais tradicionais do Reino Unido. Publicado em 2 de julho de 2025 às 10:39 Existem algumas características profundamente britânicas que se tornaram marca registrada do Reino Unido no exterior. Elas atraem turistas do outro lado do mundo, que vêm conhecer de perto o que faz o país ser tão... britânico. Entre elas, estão o chá da tarde, o autocontrole dos britânicos e o torneio de tênis de Wimbledon. O evento que acontece todos os anos na zona sul de Londres é uma instituição totalmente britânica. E ele inclui suas imagens características, como os morangos com creme, o coquetel de Pimm's e seus gandulas. Wimbledon é um sinal marcante do verão britânico — ""a Estação"", como dizem os londrinos. Como a Exposição de Flores de Chelsea, as corridas de cavalo e as regatas. E, é claro, Wimbledon também é um lugar onde as raquetes atingem pequenas bolas com perfeição. Mas o torneio inclui fundamentos menos visíveis, que também são uma marca intrínseca da sua identidade britânica. Suas regras e etiqueta são importantíssimas, tanto em termos de comportamento, quanto de vestimenta. Em outras palavras, estas regras não declaradas determinam o que os espectadores devem vestir e fazer, para não ficarem fora de sintonia com os demais. Mas o que determina a etiqueta de Wimbledon? Para início de conversa, não chame o torneio de Wimbledon, como orienta a autointitulada rainha da etiqueta, Laura Windsor. Ela atuou como consultora da série de TV Bridgerton. ""Na verdade, quando alguém se refere a Wimbledon, deve dizer 'os Championships' (torneio), já que eles são os torneios de tênis de grama mais antigos e conceituados do mundo"", segundo ela. Outra denominação adequada é simplesmente ""o tênis"". Windsor conta à BBC que o público deve se comportar ""despretensiosamente... é a nossa identidade britânica, certo? Somos formais e corretos."" Mas o que isso quer dizer? Primeiramente, é preciso evitar muitos dos comportamentos comuns em outros eventos esportivos e se comportar de forma mais adequada a uma visita ao teatro. Deve-se falar basicamente em voz baixa — e sem estender 'paus de selfie', que foram proibidos no torneio em 2015. Aliás, ""de qualquer forma, uma pessoa que ainda usar um 'pau de selfie' em 2025 precisa ser acompanhada de perto"", segundo o instrutor de etiqueta britânico William Hanson. Ele é o autor do livro Just Good Manners (""Simplesmente boas maneiras"", em tradução livre). Bom comportamento Hanson destaca que ""as pessoas adoram o lado social de Wimbledon, mas vale lembrar que este é um evento esportivo ao qual se assiste sentado, com regras próprias ao lado das quadras"". ""Seja pontual e chegue ao seu assento com antecedência"", prossegue ele. ""Respeite o fato de que você só pode ir e vir nos intervalos."" É claro que os telefones celulares devem ficar em modo silencioso. E Hanson também orienta como tratar os jogadores e autoridades na quadra. ""Seja esportista ao torcer e nunca comemore eventuais erros. Respeite o silêncio durante a partida e guarde as palmas e incentivos para os momentos entre cada ponto."" ""Evite perturbar os jogadores chamando por eles e lembre-se de que a decisão do árbitro é final — nunca interrompa, nem questione os juízes de linha."" Além disso, ""contenha-se"", orienta ele. ""Preste atenção nas pessoas sentadas à sua volta e permaneça no espaço da sua cadeira. Mesmo se for pequeno, tente não se esparramar acidentalmente para o espaço pessoal de outro espectador."" E, se tiver vontade de comer um sanduíche de atum, por exemplo, ""evite perturbar o sossego, sem fazer ruído com os papéis, nem comer alimentos desajeitados ou com odor forte"". É claro que as regras também incluem a vestimenta. E ""a melhor forma de mostrar bom comportamento é se vestir adequadamente"", segundo Windsor. Wimbledon não mantém um código de vestimenta definido, mas é recomendável usar traje formal, especialmente nas quadras principais. E certos itens são proibidos, como jeans rasgados, calçados sujos e roupas com frases de teor político. ""Use roupas confortáveis e adequadas para o clima"", orienta Hanson, ""mas evite tudo o que for casual demais ou melhor para usar na praia."" Código de vestimenta não oficial Extraoficialmente, Wimbledon criou e desenvolveu seu próprio código de normas de vestimenta. Uma prova dessas ""regras"" não declaradas, mas ainda palpáveis, foram as críticas enfrentadas por Meghan Markle, duquesa de Sussex, por ter usado jeans, chapéu e blazer, para assistir à partida da sua amiga, a tenista americana Serena Williams, no torneio de 2019. Daniel-Yaw Miller é jornalista especializado em esportes e moda. Ele é o criador do boletim SportsVerse. Para ele, ""quando se pensa em roupas para usar em Wimbledon, todos têm a mesma ideia em mente — branco ou bege. Você usa um blazer, você pode usar um chapéu.""..."

Le mannequin italien portait la pièce d'archives d'un événement post-mariage à Venise pour le fondateur d'Amazon Jeff Bezos et sa nouvelle épouse, Lauren Sánchez Bezos. La robe frappante a connu son premier moment de tapis rouge en 2003, lorsque le mannequin brésilien Gisele Bündchen, alors la petite amie de Leonardo DiCaprio, l'a porté au Met Gala. Maintenant, plus de deux décennies plus tard, il est de retour à l'honneur sur un autre partenaire de l'acteur. Archive sur la haute couture Le port de la mode archivistique rare est devenu un mouvement de prestige parmi les célébrités de la liste A, signalant la maîtrise de la mode et l'exclusivité. Contrairement aux pièces vintage, généralement plus de 20 ans, les vêtements d'archives se réfèrent souvent à des pièces de passerelle en édition limitée considérées comme de l'art portable. “Quelque chose de rare de l'histoire de la mode est un autre type de vantardise”, a déclaré Gill Linton, PDG de Byronesque, une plate-forme dédiée à la mode archivistique. “Les vêtements sont des célébrités à part entière, pour rendre les gens plus authentiques qu'ils ne le sont réellement.” Ceretti, qui a ensuite partagé des images de coutures déchirées de la robe délicate Instagramsemblait imperturbable par sa fragilité. Le moment a renforcé son image en tant que fabricant de goût moderne plutôt que comme un plus-un. Les célébrités rivalisent dans le jeu des archives Ceretti n'était pas le seul à choisir une pièce avec l'histoire. Kendall et Kylie Jenner portaient tous deux l'archivage Roberto Cavalli aux événements de pré-mariage, tandis que Sánchez portait un 2003 Alexander McQueen Habillez-vous pour un dîner pré-cérémonie. D'autres stars ont adopté des choix similaires: Naomi Campbell a renoncé à une robe Chanel Couture qu'elle a modélisée en 1996 à Cannes l'année dernière. Jennifer Lawrence a enfilé une robe en dentelle Givenchy précédemment portée par Kate Moss sur le défilé en 1996. Sabrina Carpenter stupéfaite dans une robe Bob Mackie autrefois portée par Madonna aux Oscars de 1991. Les risques de la réévolution de l'histoire Bien que la mode d'archives offre du prestige, il apporte également des risques. En 2022, Kim Kardashian a été critiquée pour avoir porté la robe Bob Mackie de 4 millions de livres sterling de Marilyn Monroe au Met Gala, ce qui soulève des préoccupations concernant les dommages potentiels aux vêtements historiques. La robe déchirée de Ceretti peut mettre en évidence les limites de la mode fragile du stockage et des tapis rouges modernes. Cependant, son choix souligne une tendance croissante: l'authenticité et le patrimoine de la mode ont maintenant plus de poids que de simplement porter les nouveaux designs. Une déclaration de style avec un but Pour Ceretti, qui a été vu plus tard à Venise portant une années 1990 Betsey Johnson habiller, l'engagement à archiver la mode semble intentionnel. Avec des stylistes qui organisaient ces looks pour soutenir la marque personnelle, porter la mode avec une trame de fond n'est pas seulement le glamour; C'est une déclaration stratégique. #petite #amie #Leonardo #DiCaprio #porte #robe #emblématique #Dolce #Gabbana #Gisele #Bündchen #Gisele #Bündchen #Met #Gala 2025-07-02 14"
mov_DFB29F0E72ED7391AFF6D3A7DC3CAE31,2025-07-02 14:50:46,en,WEB,"  ""I never forget them, I cannot believe it. I was scrubbing my face with a washcloth last night,"" the former ""Scream Queens"" star tells me with a Chanel Oberlin-worthy eye roll as we look out at the ocean from our private cabana at the Dreams Bahia Mita Surf & Spa Resort. In March 2025, I traveled to Mexico with a small group of journalists to experience Pages in Paradise, a travel program developed by Apple Vacations, Penguin Random House, and Roberts' own Belletrist book club to hook up participating resorts with curated libraries, as well as book-themed cocktail hours based on Belletrist's book of the month. ""Every time I come to Mexico, all I want to do is read by a pool and get off my phone,"" the actor tells me during a one-on-one chat. ""I always remember the books that I found on vacation, so I love that this library is gonna create lasting memories. There's something really analog and kismet and fun about just grabbing a book off a shelf that speaks to you."" So far, all is going according to Roberts's plan, with the exception of her missing makeup wipes. It's the second day of our trip and the two of us are currently sitting by a private pool that's just a short walk away from the Belletrist-approved library nestled inside the all-inclusive resort's 24-hour café and gelato bar. Once she finishes our chat and an obligatory photoshoot, Roberts plans to run straight into the ocean - and she probably won't be washing her hair for the rest of the trip. ""I try not to wash my hair on vacation. I put my hair into braids and jump in the ocean,"" she says. ""That's what I do instead of shampoo and conditioner."" Roberts is unwilling to risk mixing hotel products with her freshly dyed ""sunrise red"" hair. ""I've washed my hair when I've just dyed it and it's turned a crazy color,"" she says. ""When I have blond hair it's turned yellow, and when I've had red hair it washes it all out. So I get so scared to really give my hair a real wash."" Roberts tells me she's gone as long as five days without washing her hair on a trip. ""I try to get a blowout the day before I leave for vacation, and then I will ride that blowout into the dry-shampoo end."" When it comes to dry shampoo, Roberts trusts Oribe Gold Lust Dry Shampoo ($52) and R+Co Death Valley Dry Shampoo ($37). Both offer travel sizes. ""I don't care, I just dry-shampoo and jump in the ocean,"" she reiterates. ""I have no shame about it . . . Nothing looks better than saltwater hair."" The rest of Roberts's travel makeup routine is similarly low maintenance. ""When I'm on vacation, I just do a little concealer, a little waterproof mascara, and I'm good to go,"" she says, recommending the Kiko Milano Maxi Mod Mascara ($18). ""And then I love a little berry lip stain that also doubles as a cheek tint."" Roberts has served as a Kiko ambassador since May 2024 and swears by its ""amazing"" sheet masks, saying, ""I feel like those are a must, and those can go in the carry-on."" After spending most of our time discussing makeup and books - Roberts suggests I pick up ""The Husbands"" by Holly Gramazio, which I devoured in three days and absolutely did not take home in my carry-on - I can't help but point out it feels like we've been sucked into a secret fourth season of ""The White Lotus,"" a prospect Roberts would very much like to be a part of. ""I'm unwell from 'The White Lotus,'"" she says. ""I want to be on next season, but that's such a dumb thing to say because who doesn't?"" Even so, Roberts would love to play the show's next murder victim, adding, ""I'll just be the body."" ""The White Lotus"" creator Mike White could probably come up with a better part for Roberts than that, given her extensive résumé of TV and film roles she's been building since the age of nine. At this very moment, she looks poised to portray a vacationing Hollywood starlet in her white oval sunglasses, red cardigan, and adorable white polka-dot shorts that she's excited to exchange for a swimsuit. Of course, Roberts is plenty busy at the moment, between parenting her four-year-old son, Rhodes; starring in the upcoming rom-com ""Marriage Material""; and producing multiple projects under Belletrist Productions, including the popular Hulu series ""Tell Me Lies,"" which has been renewed for a third season. You'll have to forgive her for ever skipping the first season of something to keep up with the discourse. ""I'm always late to the party,"" she says. ""I always read and watch things after everyone's already talked about it, and then everyone's like, 'Shut up, we've already talked about it.' So I was late to 'The White Lotus' and now I'm totally addicted."" Roberts is, however, good at keeping up with her favorite reality TV shows. ""I was first to see Mike White on 'Survivor,' and fell in love with him there,"" she says of the HBO writer's turn on the long-running adventure series. ""I think I would do well on 'Survivor,' because I do well under pressure."" Though Roberts wouldn't share her strategy in case the theoretical becomes reality, she says attending an ""all-girls summer camp in the middle of nowhere"" each summer was her training ground. ""That is survivor,"" she says. ""My girlies who went to summer camp - real summer camp, not bougie summer camp - we're ruthless."" She adds, ""I don't need as many glamorous things as I think people think."" Read More Details Finally We wish PressBee provided you with enough information of ( ) Also on site"

tw_sl_90714220a193d3dd5dcfd8dd0c579f17,2025-07-02 15:42:38,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]   MADRID, 2 Jul. (EUROPA PRESS) - El próximo viernes 18 de julio, Netflix estrena 'Superestar', la serie que, producida por los Javis y creada y dirigida por Nacho Vigalondo, recupera el 'tamarismo'. En sus seis capítulos, la ficción basada en hechos reales reimagina el fenómeno televisivo de los 2000, que tuvo como protagonistas a la cantante Yurena -que comenzó su andadura artística como Tamara- y a los pintorescos Paco Porras, Loly Álvarez, Leonardo Dantés o Tony Genil. ""Gracias Suma Content. Gracias Netflix por hacer que se haga justicia después de tantos años. Os quiero"", afirmó una emocionada Yurena, que subió al escenario del Palacio de la Prensa de Madrid, donde Netflix recreó una entrega del ficticio programa 'Tiempo de Marte'. El espacio, que aparece en la serie 'Superestar' presentado por el propio Vigalondo, viene a ser un trasunto de 'Crónicas marcianas', el show real que presentó Javier Sardá y que sirvió de gran trampolín a la hora de popularizar a Tamara y todos los singulares personajes que componían su universo. Como colofón del evento, y entre lágrimas, la cantante se reencontró con Ingrid García-Jonsson, la actriz que encarna a la cantante en la serie. ""Has hecho una gran interpretación porque tienes un corazón de oro y una empatía tremenda. Gracias preciosa mía, jamás lo olvidaré. Te quiero"", proclamó Yurena, que le entregó a la actriz un ramo de flores. ""Ojalá esta serie le dé el cariño que no se le dio en su momento"", proclamó García-Jonsson, que aseguró que trabajó su recreación de la figura de Tamara/Yurena desde ""el amor"". ""Yo creo que si una persona confía en ti para que cuentes su vida en una ficción tan alocada, lo único que puedes devolverle es amor"", afirmó la actriz, que calificó de ""regalazo"" el papel protagonista de 'Superestar'. Además de ser muy exigente desde el punto de vista interpretativo, también ""es muy jugón"", ya que ""te permite enseñar muchas caras del personaje, incluso caras que jamás te imaginarías"". 'SUPERESTAR' + GOOGLE, COMBINACIÓN IMBATIBLE ""Realmente no sabemos si la serie va a funcionar mejor con la gente que lo recuerda todo o con esa otra gente que va a flipar sin saber nada, esos que luego van a ir a Google a comprobar lo que es verdadero y lo que no"", apuntó Vigalondo, que en su libre recreación del fenómeno televisivo del 'tamarismo' ha incluido elementos ""fantásticos o de ciencia ficción"", pero avisó que, a pesar de que ""hay cosas que lo van a parecer, van a parecer fantasía, pero sucedieron de verdad"". ""Hay cosas que la gente va a creer que nos hemos inventado, pero que han pasado. Lo más 'heavy' ha pasado de verdad"", secunda Claudia Costafreda, codirectora de la ficción, que asegura que con esta serie han tocado techo profesionalmente. ""Estamos jodidos con este tema. Hay una sensación de que nada será ya como esto. Es como 'Wonderwall' para Oasis"", bromeó Vigalondo. ""Gracias a los que habéis participado en esta serie porque nos habéis castrado artísticamente para siempre"", proclamó el director, que, sobre una posible segunda temporada, señaló que será ""lo que diga don Joseph Netflix, que es el único que sabe lo que puede pasar"". Por el ficticio plató de 'Tiempo de Marte', en el que Vigalondo estuvo acompañado de Aníbal Gómez y Paula Púa, también pasaron el resto de los actores principales de la serie: Natalia de Molina (Loly Álvarez), Secun de la Rosa (Leonardo Dantés), Pepón Nieto (Tony Genil), Julián Villagrán (Arlequín), Carlos Areces (Paco Porras) o Rocío Ibáñez (Margarita Seisdedos). Además de Yurena, la presentación contó también con la participación de Samantha Ballentines, la cantante Luna Ki y Esty Quesada, así como con la presencia en el patio de butacas de rostros conocidos como Samantha Hudson, Yenesi, Alex Saint, Brays Efe, Javi Hoyos, Inés Hernand, Alex de Lucas, Pitita Queen, Lola Rodríguez, Oro Jondo, Hornella Góngora, Arantxa Castilla-La Mancha o Chanel Anorex, entre otros. ""Con el cambio de siglo, un cometa atravesó el cielo de España, desmontando las leyes de la fama y el éxito, desintegrando la frontera entre lo popular y lo underground. Durante un par de años, las portadas y las horas de prime time fueron conquistadas por famosos de otra dimensión.

(EUROPA PRESS) - El próximo viernes 18 de julio, Netflix estrena 'Superestar', la serie que, producida por los Javis y creada y dirigida por Nacho Vigalondo, recupera el 'tamarismo'. En sus seis capítulos, la ficción basada en hechos reales reimagina el fenómeno televisivo de los 2000, que tuvo como protagonistas a la cantante Yurena -que comenzó su andadura artística como Tamara- y a los pintorescos Paco Porras, Loly Álvarez, Leonardo Dantés o Tony Genil.

Como colofón del evento, y entre lágrimas, la cantante se reencontró con Ingrid García-Jonsson, la actriz que encarna a la cantante en la serie. ""Has hecho una gran interpretación porque tienes un corazón de oro y una empatía tremenda. Gracias preciosa mía, jamás lo olvidaré. Te quiero"", proclamó Yurena, que le entregó a la actriz un ramo de flores.

mov_FBA5C90D318E533FB400D7791107879B,2025-07-02 16:42:36,en,WEB,"  Gabe Ginsberg Lindsay Lohan has had a busy few years back in the spotlight after nearly a decade-long break from acting. Now, following a Netflix contract that included three romantic comedies and a reunion with Jamie Lee Curtis for a Freaky Friday sequel (out in August), it seems the star is taking a well-deserved vacation. (They didn't call it a Lohanaissance for nothing!) The actor, who is celebrating her 39th birthday today (HBD, LiLo!) recently shared images from her very own Roman Holiday with her husband, Bader Shammas, and her toddler son Luai, who was born in 2023. In the of images posted to Instagram, the Freakier Friday star looks radiant walking around the Italian city with her family. She even gave fans a rare glimpse at Luai, who's pictured toddling around a lush garden and being toted around on his mother's hip. Don't get me wrong, Luai is adorable, but what really struck me about this particular photo dump is Lohan's vacation wardrobe—specifically her lace-on-lace layering. The Mean Girls actor wore tea-length white lace slip dress which she layered under Doen's Sohana lace button-up dress, giving an airy, “I just threw this on” kind of vibe that's exactly how I'm trying to dress on vacation. Will I be staying at what is probably a five-star resort in Rome? No. Can I aspire to dress like someone who does? Yes, duh. Lohan wore a pair of oversize sunglasses (you can take the girl out of the 2000s, but you can't take the 2000s out of the girl) and a wide-brimmed sunhat, though I have to imagine that her choice in accessories had more to do with going incognito than making a fashion statement. That, and sun protection. A pair of mesh ballet flats with a single buckle (they look a lot like Alaïa's Mary Jane flats, which have been knocked off ad nauseum) added a modern element to the whole Dolce Vita vibe, and also matched her quilted black Chanel bag. Then there're her all-white looks, which epitomize that effortless “it's too hot for anything else” Mediterranean style mantra. Both dresses are slightly sheer, but feature an opaque layer. The second look has a bit of lace trim at the hem, not unlike Kate Middleton's and Jennifer Lawrence's recent white skirts. (Wee-woo trend alert.) Of course every outfit is instantly upgraded when you dress your baby to match, as Lohan did. With the Freakier Friday premiere approaching quickly on August 8, we assume we're about to see a lot more of LiLo's street style, as well as some red carpet moments. Bellisima!

mov_AB28BCB31E9E0514AAFCF92C6D454F1F,2025-07-02 17:12:53,en,WEB,"  They say, fashion comes its fair share of faux pas and flair! While luxurious wardrobes and style statements speak for the 'flair' part, the faux pas part most certainly includes the mispronunciations of the well-known fashion brands (despite those being extremely famous). And while these mishaps are quite cliché, they're not chic at all. Because let's be honest – in the world of fashion, half the battle is looking the part, and the rest of it is acing the etiquette (which includes the correct pronunciation of popular fashion brands). Mispronouncing a luxury label can cost you credibility faster than you can say “Céline.” Lucky for you, we've done the hard work. From Parisian labels to Italian icons and streetwear staples, this guide is sprinkled with phonetic line-drawing, brand backstories, and quirky insider tips to help you glide through any style conversation with ease. So, say goodbye to awkward pauses and hello to stylish confidence – let's break it down, brand by brand. French elegance: Subtle, chic, and tricky Hermès – Not “Her-meez,” but gentle vowel start, silent 'H' and 's': “air‑MEZ” or “er‑MEZ”, not “her‑meez.” Givenchy – Often butchered as “Gah‑vin‑chee.” The correct French flourish? “zhee‑VOHN‑shee”, with soft 'G', nasal 'on', and a gentle final “‑shee.” Chanel – Forget “Shan‑elle.” The proper style? “SHUH‑nel.” Chic, crisp, simple, and oh-so‑Parisian. Balmain – Yes, it's not “BAL‑mayn.” Roll it out like “bal‑MAH”, trailing off the 'n' softly for that French flair. Yves Saint Laurent – Drop those hard Ts! The smooth version: “EEV san‑loh‑rah(n)”, a lovers' lane nasal finish. Christian Louboutin – Strut smoothly: “kris‑tee‑ahn loo‑boo‑TAHN”, not “tin.” Christian Lacroix – “LA-kwa.” So “kris‑tee‑ahn luh‑kwa”, rolling that l–r combo beautifully. Comme des Garçons – Play it subtly: “comb‑DAY gar‑SON”, letting the 's' fade, nasal 'on' intact. Italian icons: Bold, bright, and vowely Gucci – It's “GOO‑chee”, emphasis on the first syllable, never “Goo‑kee.” Versace – Despite the trendy slip, it's properly “ver‑SAH‑cheh.” Donatella herself has piped up to confirm it. Prada – Simple and sweet: “PRAH‑dah”, sturdy first syllable, light second. Moschino – The fun-filled style comes through in “mos‑KEY‑no”, not “mos‑chee‑no.” Bottega Veneta – Soft and elegant: “boh‑TEH‑gah veh‑NEH‑ta”, a solid roll in every segment. Dolce & Gabbana – Smooth Italian gloss: “DOL‑chay eh ga‑BAN‑eh”, not “Gab‑anna.” Spanish flair and subtle sound Balenciaga – Spanish royalty. Break it into “bah‑LEN‑see‑AH‑gah,” emphasizing the “AH” and smoothing past the “cia.” Loewe – Spanish elegance meets German twist: say “lo‑WEH‑vay”, not “low‑eeve.” Athleisure staples Adidas – A German classic: “AH‑dee‑dahs”, emphasis on the first syllable, founder Adi Dassler's namesake. Nike – Named after the Greek goddess, it's “NY‑kee”, not “Nighk.” Porsche – Elegant German soap-opera: “POR‑shuh”, with a soft “‑uh” ending. Cross-cultural gems Bvlgari (Latin-script brand) – Pronounce “BOOL‑gah‑ree,” highlighting the “u” after “B.” Cartier – Soft, refined: “kar‑tee‑AY”, not “Car‑tee‑er.” Jacquemus – From French fashion forward: “ZHAK‑moose.” Celine – A blend of syllables: “seh‑LEEN,” soft start, piercing end. Nailing the correct pronunciation of a fashion might seem like a superficial conquest – but it isn't just about speaking the name; it's about stepping into the essence of each brand. Elevating your fashion conversations goes beyond clothes – it's about knowing the names and pronouncing them with confidence, creativity, and cultural awareness. From the sonorous softness of French designers to the vibrant clarity of Italian labels, each namescape tells a story – learn the sound, share the style. With this guide, you're not just knocking it out of the vocabulary park; you're stepping onto the stylistic stage with poise and pizzazz...."
n0z4x0i,2025-07-02 17:14:07,en,REDDIT,"  Chanel is mot my thing but if you truly love it, start saving. Research. Look for it used… maybe you can get it on Afterpay or Klarna. I bought my YSL that way and even tho it's a small car payment every month it was still better than putting out 4500 at once for me."
mov_3E7B54EBFBCE404FE724C963D393B0EC,2025-07-02 17:38:00,en,WEB,"  The Starboard Group is seizing the moment. With the cruise industry experiencing a sustained rebound post-COVID-19, the Starboard Group, operator of boutiques aboard cruise liners and super yachts, has been rolling out new product initiatives and services ranging from personalizing jewelry and ear piercings, to tequila developed with the Invicta Watch Group. More from WWD Starboard also plans to launch a natural diamond program this fall, details of which will be revealed later this summer. “Cruising has never been more popular,” said Caryl Capeci, Starboard's senior vice president of fine jewelry and Swiss watches. “There was a stoppage of the cruise ships during COVID-19, and then it all came back. We've seen not only the number of passengers but also retail sales on cruise ships grow and grow and grow. And in June, we had record high sales volume.” During an interview Tuesday, Capeci cited statistics indicating the cruise industry is forecast to carry 37 million passengers in 2025, up from approximately 34.6 million last year, with expectations to reach 42 million by 2028. So an opportunity to capture greater wallet share from more passengers on board cruise ships exists. Last year, Starboard cruise line shops generated an estimated $800 million to under $1 billion, according to sources. Capeci declined to confirm the figure though she characterized Starboard's 2024 volume as in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Starboard works with 14 cruise lines, including Royal Caribbean, Virgin Voyages and Carnival Cruise Line, and more than 95 different cruise ships selling everything from beauty, fragrance and liquor to apparel, Swiss watches and fine and fashion jewelry. Through its cruise and luxury division, Starboard operates single-brand shops, as well as multibrand shops on ships. Among the brand shops are Omega, Brietling, Tag Heuer, Bulgari, Hublot, Cartier, IWC, Panerai, Piaget, Messika, Swarovski and Pandora. Also sold are beauty brands such as Dior, Chanel, Lancome, Clinique, Estée Lauder, Clarins and La Mer. Shops range from 100 to 750 square feet. The merchandise in the Starboard shops is duty free and tax free. Among the initiatives Capeci cited: Boutiques for Cartier, IWC Schaffhausen and Piaget aboard Luminara, the newest super yacht in The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, which was launched this week. The boutiques offer Swiss timepieces, fine jewelry and accessories, as well as private viewings, in-suite appointments and sessions with brand ambassadors to explore the craftsmanship and heritage of the brands. Also on offer are designer jewelry, luxury accessories and resortwear — from vintage Hermès bags and Stella McCartney handbags to fine jewelry by Ileana Makri, Lauren Rubinski and Sydney Evan. Ear piercing in partnership with Inverness, the ear piercing system, has been set up on 33 ships across multiple cruise lines in the past couple of months. Starboard says “expertly trained retail team members” administer the piercings. The debut of Invicta Tequila is for sale exclusively aboard 26 cruise ships worldwide, produced for the Invicta Watch Group by Mexico's Casa Maestri Distillery. Onboard tastings and personalized activations are offered. Engraving stations for personalizing jewelry are being set up. Mail-order services for most of the jewelry and watch brands sold at Starboard shops began rolling out in mid-May. Passengers can view digital catalogues on iPads to select styles, ring sizes or colors that not on the ship and have them shipped home. Rolling out financing through FlexPay with interest free, interest bearing and buy now, pay later options. The rollout began four months ago on Carnival and is being extended to all Starboard cruise line partners. “Most guests on cruises are celebrating something with their loved ones, whether it's a birthday, an anniversary or a family milestone so they come with a desire to splurge, to discover new brands and items connected to the destination they're traveling to,” Capeci said. “But most importantly, they want to mark the time with something meaningful, and we all know that jewelry and timepieces are among the most special ways to mark an event or a vacation, and remember time spent together with loved ones. For those reasons, most voyages we sell on do quite a nice business in fine jewelry. Fine jewelry and watches are probably 40 percent or more of our total sales. It's very significant.” Sales at Starboard's cruise line boutiques are selling at much higher rate than pre-COVID-19, globally, with the exception of China, Capeci said. “Pre-COVID, we did a significant business on ships sailing out of Shanghai and mainland China. That market has not returned. “The largest region in terms of retail value and sales is the Caribbean by far because of the sheer number of passengers that sail in the Caribbean and the size of the ships,” Capeci said. Cruises in Alaska and the Mediterranean, particularly summertime, also generate “very significant” business. Asked what's selling best, Capeci said: “Diamonds are huge. Yellow gold is huge. Materials that are connected to the destinations they travel to are very important. So if they're going to Australia, they want opals. If they're going to South America, they want green emeralds. The destination they're traveling to and the jewelry that we're offering are always connected. You could buy emeralds at home, but it's not as meaningful as it is when you just visited that location of their origin.” The Invicta brand, founded in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, in 1837, “is one of our most successful and longest running partners for watches,” Capeci said. “They're moving into more lifestyle-driven programs...."

With his head bowed, revealing the shock of hair which had turned white during his 10-month stay in federal prison, the music mogul celebrated what was . Moments later he stood up from the royal blue and gold carpet in courtroom 26A and began to clap. His mother and six of his seven children, who for eight weeks have dutifully crammed into the wooden pews just feet away from Combs, erupted into applause and cheers, with some wiping tears from their eyes. Combs had been convicted of two of five federal sex crimes. But it was his that sparked an uproar of jubilation. Had Combs been convicted of sex trafficking his former girlfriends, which included the R&B singer Cassie Ventura, or racketeering conspiracy, he could have faced life in prison. Now he will likely spend a minimal time behind bars before returning to his glittering life of luxury and excess. The odds had appeared to be stacked against. Indeed, the majority of federal cases end in conviction. And this showbiz trial featured graphic videos of days-long “freak offs”, drug-fuelled parties in which his former partners would have sex with male escorts while he watched. But the prosecution appeared to bite off more than it could chew with a complicated racketeering crime that was usually used to prosecute mob bosses. When this trial started nearly two months ago, defence lawyer Teny Geragos made an extraordinary admission in her opening statement: Combs was a domestic abuser with a vicious temper. The 55-year-old's assault of Ventura at the InterContinental hotel in Los Angeles, caught on CCTV, was “indefensible, horrible, dehumanising and violent”, she said. “But it is not evidence of sex trafficking”, she added, “It is evidence of domestic violence.” It was a bold and unconventional legal strategy, painting her client as a domestic abuser from the outset. But it began the work of disentangling him from the most serious charges. Much of the evidence against Combs was simply proof of a lurid, “swinger's lifestyle”, said Marc Agnifilo, the mogul's attorney, who is also representing Luigi Mangione and previously defended convicted fraudster Martin Shrekli. After jurors were shown pictures of , used in Combs's sex parties, Mr Agnifilo let off a sarcastic “Whoo!” , pointing out that the substances are not illegal. “Thank God for the Special Response team,” he said, of the agents who raided Combs's homes in Miami Beach and Los Angeles. “They found the Astroglide, they found the baby oil!” The prosecution had attempted to prove that Combs compelled his girlfriends to take part in the orgies with threats of violence, financial manipulation and even kidnapping. But time and again Mr Agnifilo said the women had the chance to leave. “No one's forcing her to do this,” he said of Ventura. “She's a woman who actually likes sex – good for her.” He was more scathing about “Jane”, who alleged the threat to cut-off her $10,000 a month rent left her without any choice. In text messages shared with the jury, Jane wrote to Combs that their relationship had opened a “Pandora's box”. “It's hurting me bc I'm so much more than being loved in the dark in hotel rooms, doing things that make me feel disgusted w myself,” she wrote. “I'm confusing your lust for me as real love…. I don't want to fell obligated to perform these nights w you in fear of losing the roof over my head.” Under the terms of a “love contract” she signed with Combs, he agreed to pay her rent for two years – and is currently still doing so, Mr Agnifilo pointed out. “I hope she's having a nice day,” he said. “In a house he's paying for.” “The thrust of the prosecution's case was focused solely on two alleged victims, Cassie and Jane, with whom Sean Combs had long-term relationships,” said Tony Buzbee, a lawyer who is representing some of Combs's further alleged victims in a string of civil suits. “Perhaps because of the nature of his relationship with those women and the length of those two relationships, I think the jury struggled with the difficult issue of consent and more broadly whether Mr Combs's conduct appropriately fit within the RICO [racketeering] statute.” During his rambunctious, four-hour long closing argument, Mr Agnifilo saved particular ridicule for the racketeering charge. “Are you kidding me?” he said, arguing the jury had been presented with “two trials” over the seven-week case, one involving the actual evidence and the other a “badly, badly exaggerated story.” In order to prove a racketeering conspiracy, prosecutors had to show that he had agreed to commit at least two crimes with knowing co-conspirators. They argued that he co-opted loyal employees, including his chief of staff, Kristina Khorram, into a variety of criminal acts. But although the names of Combs's alleged accomplices came up again and again in court, the prosecution did not subpoena them, which may have confused the jury. Where are these “co-conspirators”, Mr Agnifilo asked? Only his client had been indicted with any crimes, and no witnesses testified to being part of a racketeering enterprise. Speaking forcefully and pacing across the court room, the attorney dwelled at length on the allegation that Combs had roped his staff into criminal acts against Kid Cudi, a Grammy-winning rapper with whom Ventura had a brief romantic relationship in 2011. There was no evidence, Mr Agnifilo said, that Combs had anything to do with a Molotov cocktail that was placed inside Kid Cudi's Porsche in 2012. Ventura testified that he had vowed to blow up the vehicle in the rapper's driveway – but doing so was “cowardly” and “not in Combs's style,” Mr Agnifilo said. Yes, Combs did break into the rapper's house the year before, but that was merely trespassing – not an offence included in the racketeering charge. Michael Bachner, a New York-based criminal defence lawyer and former District Attorney, told The Telegraph that proving racketeering was always going to be an uphill challenge. “There was evidence of people helping him, but I think it was still a stretch for them to prove that this was part of some concerted conspiracy to do it as opposed to just telling people what to do.”..."

Recorded from Channel 4+1 on Monday 22nd December 2008 21:58  The last recording today is the first episode in a three part series of ghost stories for Christmas, Crooked House - The Wainscoting. A man brings an old door knocker to an antiques expert, and hears some ghost stories about the house it came from. Lee Ingleby plays the man, Ben. Mark Gatiss, who also wrote this, plays the ""Curator"". The first story concerns a Mr Joseph Bloxham, a man who has recently bought the house in question, Geap Manor and is having it modernised. He's also recently been involved in a financial ""bubble"", making money himself, but having seen many people lose everything when the scheme collapsed. He's played by Philip Jackson. Julian Rhind-Tutt plays his friend, Noakes, who takes him to task for his part of a scheme that led to at least one man going to debtor's prison. Andy Nyman plays his other friend Duncalfe. Bloxham is slightly annoyed that his workman who are modernising the house aren't going to be finished when they said they would. Mr Coil tells him ""I can only apologise, Mr Bloxham. But real craftsmanship cannot be rushed, sir. You wouldn't want that, would you?"" ""No, no, of course not."" ""I mean, you could get in any nickninnie to take on a job like this, but you'd regret it."" ""Yes, yes."" ""Well, you have my absolute assurance that my men and me will have quit the place by the end of October."" ""You swear it?"" ""Give or take."" Coil shows him the new wainscoting he's put in, with the very finest timber, as requested. Bloxham asks about some staining on the wood. ""And of course, the wainscoting will soon be painted, will it not? A nice sage green. Look lovely in here, Mr Bloxham. I like a green."" Some time later, Bloxham is accosted by Mrs Glanville, wife of a man who was thrown in prison for debts after the collapse of Bloxham's scheme. ""My husband, sir, blew his brains out last evening."" ""What?"" ""He procured a pistol. How I know not. Then he wrote me a short farewell. And then he took his own life."" ""My deepest sympathies, madam."" ""My own dear Harry. A fine man, Joseph Bloxham. A kind man...."

Unveiled at Watches and Wonders 2025, the latest iteration of the J12, featuring a case crafted entirely from lab-grown sapphire, underscores Chanel's ongoing commitment to both aesthetic innovation and technical mastery. The luxury watch market, valued at approximately $60 billion globally in 2024, continues to see demand for iconic designs and cutting-edge materials, positioning the J12's anniversary release as a significant event. The J12's Enduring Legacy: From Sailing Inspiration to Modern Icon Launched in the year 2000, the J12 rapidly ascended to prominence as a symbol of contemporary sophistication and daring design. Its fluid, aerodynamic silhouette, initially drawing inspiration from the sleek hulls of America's Cup racing yachts – rather than traditional watch design cues – immediately distinguished it. The early adoption of advanced materials, notably ceramic, further cemented its status as a disruptor in the world of horology.The J12 wasn't merely a timepiece; it was a statement. A New Dimension of Luxury: Introducing the J12 Bleu Chanel's latest evolution of the J12 introduces a groundbreaking element: a case constructed entirely from lab-grown sapphire. this marks a pivotal moment for the model, pushing the boundaries of what's achievable in watch case construction. Sapphire, renowned for its exceptional hardness – second only to diamond – provides unparalleled scratch resistance and a unique visual depth. The deep, intense blue hue is not simply a color request, but an inherent property of the sapphire itself. As Arnaud Chastaingt, Director of Chanel Watchmaking, explains, the creative process behind achieving this unique blue shade, highlighting the technical challenges and artistic vision involved. This isn't just about aesthetics; it's about mastering a complex material. The Philosophy of Creation: Authorship and Articulation in Design Innovation as a Constant: The J12's Trajectory The J12's journey over the past 25 years has been defined by a relentless pursuit of innovation. From its initial embrace of ceramic – a material previously uncommon in high-end watchmaking – to its current exploration of lab-grown sapphire, the watch has consistently challenged conventions. Consider the parallel with the automotive industry, where brands like Porsche continually refine their iconic 911 model with new technologies and materials while preserving its core identity. The J12 follows a similar path, evolving without losing sight of its original spirit. “The J12's 25th anniversary is a testament to its enduring legacy. From its pioneering use of ceramic to its latest embrace of lab-grown sapphire, the watch continues to represent Chanel's dedication to innovation, style, and the art of watchmaking. The new J12 Bleu is poised to become the next chapter in the story of this iconic timepiece, captivating watch enthusiasts for years to come.” Chanel Watchmaking Daniel Kim — Technology Editor With a UC Berkeley computer-science degree and a decade at Wired, Daniel Kim covers AI breakthroughs, cybersecurity threats, and consumer-tech launches.

For me, #fashion has always been something deeper, something closer to the soul – an escape, an aspiration, an art form woven into the fabric of memory and culture. Growing up in #Haiti, particularly during the era leading up to the mid-1980s, presented a complex picture of fashion. In the middle-class environment where my early years were spent, there was an undeniable exposure to high society and, with it, a glimpse into the world of high fashion. This was the time when figures like Michèle Bennett Duvalier, the First Lady, were known for their lavish tastes, reportedly spending astronomical sums on Haute Couture from European houses and exquisite jewelry. (Research confirms Michelle #Duvalier's significant spending on designers like GIVENCHY and Boucheron , making her a symbol of that era's connection to global luxury).

So I am rewriting some of it, without putting in the dates and direct quotes. 1. You mix up fact and opinion. There have been several instances when laws, quotes from skits, anecdotal stories from commenters lives. That you discredit, with comments like, ""We all have an opinion."" Yes but facts over ride your opinion. Discrediting you no nothing about is not respect. 2. You attempt to gas light commenters. Take this thread itself. You questioned how employees could take Friday off, when there wasn't a time they could meet together until next month. Someone commented that while checking the calendar, employees were on vacation. You stated, ""when did I say anything about “vacation time”? Love it how you make stuff up."" She put the content creator's story line above you. You were also critisizing her with, ""Love it how you make stuff up."" When she was not the one making stuff up. YOU WERE. 3. You purposely make comments that ignore and upset those who enjoy watching the creators content. No one who has watched this chanel thinks Linda was effective. You just say comments to be a pain. You have even made comments that change previous opinions. ie. You as a parent have a right to no when a teacher is going to have a baby. Then later you have no children. So which is it?? 4. You claim to know more about situation and careers, than those who have been in them for decades. You claimed to know how many electrical units are in my room, whether or not doctors write on post-its (they still don't), if electrical lunch bags are safe for children, you thought they were despite what the manufactories directions say. you know more about childbirth than those of us that have given birth. You know more about the hours and days I work. Even when my boss says I have to go in, you say I am not required to be there. So yeah that is disrespect. Especially when every in the field knows that you are wrong you think your opinion equals the FACTS. All of these things are not control by opinion but by facts. If you want to be respectful, accept that experts in a field know more than someone not effected by it at all. How would you know what giving birth is like? How would you know when schools start? How would you know how many hours/ weeks/ months a year a teacher works? No one knows everything. 5. Any time someone disagrees with you, you delete their comment, claim they only no about 1% even though, they are experts in their field. But of course you would know more. So please explain how that shows respect. 6. You arogantly assume that only your opinion matters. Women shouldn't have children, if they work. Workers should devote their whole exsistence to their career...."

Theo cáo trạng, đầu năm 2021, bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương bắt đầu kinh doanh online các mặt hàng cao cấp như thực phẩm chức năng, mỹ phẩm, túi xách, nước hoa, đồng hồ... từ các thương hiệu nổi tiếng như Hermes, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Versace... Để có vốn mở rộng quy mô kinh doanh, từ tháng 3/2021, Phương kêu gọi vợ chồng Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh cùng góp vốn đầu tư. Cả ba lập nhóm chat có tên ""KIM MONOLOLY GROUP"" trên ứng dụng Viber để giao dịch. Sau đó, Phương tự lập các đơn hàng, ghi rõ ngày đi - ngày về và mức lãi suất cao (từ 10% đến 100%) để kêu gọi vốn từ Long, Trinh và những người thân quen của họ. Mỗi đơn hàng có giá trị từ 10 triệu đồng đến hơn 4 tỷ đồng. Các bị cáo tại phiên toà. Việc góp vốn diễn ra suôn sẻ, lợi nhuận cao khiến nhiều người tiếp tục tham gia. Vợ chồng Long và Trinh còn hạ mức lãi suất cho các nhà đầu tư cấp dưới để hưởng chênh lệch từ mức lãi suất mà Phương cam kết. Tuy nhiên, sau một thời gian, hoạt động kinh doanh thua lỗ, hàng hóa không tiêu thụ được khiến Phương mất khả năng chi trả. Để tiếp tục duy trì dòng tiền và trả lãi cho các đơn cũ, bị cáo này lập các đơn hàng giả với lãi suất cao để lôi kéo nhà đầu tư mới, thực chất là chiếm đoạt tiền. Từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, Phương đã huy động vốn thông qua 1.158 đơn hàng, nhận tổng cộng 505,16 tỷ đồng, đã tất toán 990 đơn hàng với lãi suất hơn 91,39 tỷ đồng. Còn lại 168 đơn hàng chưa tất toán, tương ứng 112,3 tỷ đồng. Sau khi trừ phần lãi đã trả, số tiền Phương chiếm đoạt thực tế là 20,3 tỷ đồng. Số tiền này được Phương sử dụng vào các mục đích cá nhân như thuê nhà, thuê kho bãi, vận chuyển hàng hóa, xoay vòng dòng tiền và tiêu xài. Đến ngày 12/4/2022, Phương chính thức tuyên bố mất khả năng thanh toán. Riêng đối với Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh, quá trình điều tra cho thấy, từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, 2 bị cáo này sử dụng tiền cá nhân, tiền của người thân và tiền của các nhà đầu tư để đầu tư cho Phương. Đáng chú ý, ngay trước thời điểm Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ, ngày 12/4/2022, Phương vẫn gửi 12 đơn hàng với lãi suất từ 6% đến 25% để Long và Trinh tiếp tục huy động vốn. 3 người đầu tư là anh Nguyễn Tiến Phương 500 triệu đồng, chị Ngô Thị Diệu Lý 850 triệu đồng và anh Trần Hùng 794 triệu đồng. Tuy nhiên, chỉ vài giờ sau, Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ. Vợ chồng Long, Trinh chỉ hoàn trả lại cho anh Trần Hùng toàn bộ số tiền đã góp nhưng không thông báo cho chị Lý và anh Phương, cũng không trả lại số tiền 1,35 tỷ đồng mà đã chiếm đoạt để sử dụng cá nhân. Ngoài ra, sau khi Phương mất khả năng chi trả, vợ chồng Long, Trinh đã bán căn nhà ở số 4/8 Phạm Ngọc Thạch, Tp.Huế với giá 4,3 tỷ đồng để trả nợ cho người thân nhưng vẫn không hoàn trả số tiền 1,35 tỷ đồng cho chị Lý và anh Phương. Tại phiên tòa, 3 bị cáo thành khẩn khai báo, ăn năn hối hận về hành vi của mình, các bị cáo xin HĐXX cho được hưởng mức án nhẹ nhất để sớm trở về với gia đình. Sau khi nghị án, HĐXX tuyên phạt bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương 14 năm tù về tội Lừa đảo chiếm đoạt tài sản, bị cáo Phạm Thanh Long 5 năm tù và Nguyễn Thu Trinh 3 năm 6 tháng tù về tội Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản.

Cáo trạng của VKSND TP Huế cho hay, đầu năm 2021, Phương bắt đầu kinh doanh online các mặt hàng thực phẩm chức năng, mỹ phẩm, túi xách, nước hoa, đồng hồ... từ nhiều thương hiệu nổi tiếng như Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel, Hermes, Versace... Phương đã kêu gọi vợ chồng Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh cùng góp vốn đầu tư. Cả 3 người lập nhóm chat “Kim Monololy Group” trên ứng dụng Viber để giao dịch. Phương tự lập các đơn hàng, ghi rõ ngày đi, ngày về và mức lãi suất cao (từ 10% đến 100%) để kêu gọi vốn từ Long, Trinh và những người thân quen. Mỗi đơn hàng có giá trị cao từ 10 triệu đồng đến hơn 4 tỷ đồng. Nhiều người đã tham gia góp vốn kinh doanh online cùng Phương. Sau một thời gian, hoạt động kinh doanh thua lỗ, hàng hóa không tiêu thụ được khiến Phương mất khả năng chi trả. Nhằm tiếp tục duy trì dòng tiền và trả lãi cho các đơn cũ, Phương lập các đơn hàng giả với lãi suất cao để lôi kéo nhà đầu tư mới, thực chất là chiếm đoạt tiền. Trong thời gian từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, Phương đã huy động vốn thông qua 1.158 đơn hàng, nhận tổng cộng 505,16 tỷ đồng. Phương đã tất toán 990 đơn hàng với lãi suất hơn 91,39 tỷ đồng. Còn lại 168 đơn hàng chưa tất toán, tương ứng 112,3 tỷ đồng. Sau khi trừ phần lãi đã trả, số tiền Phương chiếm đoạt thực tế là 20,3 tỷ đồng. Số tiền này được Phương sử dụng vào các mục đích cá nhân như thuê nhà, thuê kho bãi, vận chuyển hàng hóa, xoay vòng dòng tiền và tiêu xài cá nhân. Đến ngày 12/4/2022, Phương tuyên bố mất khả năng thanh toán. 3 bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương, Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh tại phiên tòa sơ thẩm.

In Season The Grown-Up Blueberry That Goes Perfectly With Ice Cream By Tanya Bush In the northern corners of Canada, early summer brings haskap, an inky indigo berry shaped like a bluebell. Native to the subarctic regions of Japan, Russia and northeastern China, the fruit also proliferates in Canada, where it thrives in below-zero temperatures and freezes beautifully, meaning its tart, tannic, almost black currant-like flavor can be preserved long after its short blooming season ends. In Toronto, the chef Zach Kolomeir, who runs the restaurants Dreyfus, Vilda's and Bernhardt's, says he was first drawn to haskaps for their “grown-up blueberry” quality. He sources them frozen from Ontario and uses the berries year-round, simmered into jams for sufganiyot (jelly doughnuts), tucked into lemon cream mille-feuille or blended with lemon zest in seasonal soft serve twists of haskap berry and vanilla. “They work great in creamy and crunchy components, and also with citrus,” Kolomeir says. At Proof Line Farm, which includes a creamery and market in Ontario, the co-owner Janan McNaughton first encountered haskaps when a neighboring farmer began experimenting with growing the berry. She was surprised by how well it maintained its deep color and flavor in a rich ice cream base. “Most berries get lost in whole milk. Not haskap,” she says. It's become a seasonal staple, starring in gelato flavors like Northern Lights, a violet-hued swirl of haskap and mint. This season, she will also be selling haskaps fresh at the farm: “Everyone connects with berries — haskap walks a nice line of being familiar while also novel.” On Canada's west coast, the chef Warren Chow of Wildlight Kitchen and Bar in Vancouver uses fresh haskaps in both sweet and savory dishes, from cheesecakes marbled with haskap jam to a compote that cuts through a fatty duck breast. “They're extremely nutrient-rich, full of antioxidants and vitamins,” he says, “and we have an abundance here.” Wear This Perfume Necklaces for a Portable Mood Boost By Laura Regensdorf For centuries, fragrance has found its way into wearable accessories. Spherical cases filled with aromatics, called pomanders, dangled from waist belts in Renaissance Europe; perforated boxes known as vinaigrettes, intended to hold a sponge soaked in scented vinegar, made the rounds in the Georgian and Victorian eras. In the 1970s, Elsa Peretti put her stamp on the category, reworking her Halston perfume bottle into a teardrop necklace. “It's a cool party trick,” says Carol Han Pyle, the founder of the fragrance house Nette, speaking about her collaboration with the jeweler Dévé: a bullet-shaped silver pendant that neatly conceals one of her sample vials (or any other). The designer Sophie Buhai took inspiration from Austria's Wiener Werkstätte movement for her silver Obelisque holder, accented with jade and onyx and set on a handmade chain. While suited for any material (one client slipped in a mezuza scroll), Buhai created it for essential oils. An appreciation for history also guides the small-batch beauty line Kindred Black and the jewelry brand J. Hannah, which have adapted their Modernist silver bottle (a limited edition from 2022) for the neck, using repurposed chains. Launching July 24, each comes with a tiny glass bottle of their perfume oil, Drink Deep, Psyche — a grounding floral with rose, vanilla and frankincense — along with a small piece of wool to absorb the scent and tuck inside. Vintage hounds will appreciate Liis Found, a capsule collection of silver perfume pendants sourced by Leslie Hendin, who co-founded the fragrance brand Liis. After an initial spring release, the second drop of minimalist necklaces arrives today. The designer Jean Prounis recalls how her grandmother's jewelry box was heady with Chanel No. 5. Channeling that memory, Prounis steeps strands of porous materials — in this case, turquoise and sandalwood — in her own signature amber oil. Available July 22, each scented necklace features a 22-karat gold clasp modeled on ancient Greek fibulas used to fasten clothing. The effect conjures a far-flung talisman, warmed by the sun. Stay Here On the Spanish Island of Minorca, a Pair of Hotels Immersed in Nature By Gisela Williams In rural northern Minorca, where wild meadows slope down to beach coves with red-hued sand, a pair of former farm estates have been turned into boutique hotels. Son Ermità, which opened in mid-June, is an elegant neo-Classical building on a hill that overlooks the sea on one side and a valley with a network of centuries-old stone walls on the other. Binidufà, scheduled to open Aug. 22, is a restored 18th-century finca next to an ancient forest that's a 30-minute walk away on a hiking trail or a 10-minute ride on a four-wheel-drive buggy. Son Ermità has a formal restaurant that serves French- and Spanish-inspired dishes like crayfish ravioli with seafood Blanchette, while Mesura, the main dining room at Binidufà, will offer plant-based dishes like avocado served with pico de gallo and yogurt, including ingredients grown on the property's farm. Marta Madera Fernandez, a co-founder of Vestige Collection, the family-run hotel group behind the openings, says the company chose Minorca because “the island is one of the few places in Spain that is still very protected. It has a stillness that's not easy to find anymore.” Rooms from about $870 a night for two guests, including breakfast, vestigecollection.com.

Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) and C3.ai present choice investment opportunities in the AI sector, each with unique strengths and potential. TSMC: The Unsung Hero of AI Hardware Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC), the world's leading semiconductor foundry, is crucial to the AI revolution.The Taiwan-based company manufactures chips for industry giants like Nvidia, Apple, Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), and Qualcomm (QCOM). Without TSMC's advanced manufacturing capabilities, the AI industry would face significant hardware limitations. Did You Know? TSMC's revenue reached $75.8 billion in 2023,underscoring its dominance in the semiconductor manufacturing industry. Over the past five years, TSMC stock (TSM) has delivered a return of 252%. In 2024, the stock has increased by 18.1%, surpassing the S&P 500 Index ($SPX) gain of 5.7%. TSMC stock performance compared to S&P 500. TSMC has established a strong competitive advantage through technological innovation and long-term partnerships with industry leaders.Nvidia,a major TSMC customer,relies on the company to produce advanced AI chips like the H100 and GH200,which power AI data centers. As Nvidia's sales surge and other AI-focused companies like AMD and Amazon (AMZN) develop custom chips, TSMC is capturing a significant portion of the growing demand. In the first quarter,TSMC's total revenue increased by 35% year-over-year to $25.5 billion. Management reported that “7-nanometer and more advanced technologies accounted for 73%” of total wafer revenue. Diluted earnings per share increased by 60.4% during the quarter. To mitigate geopolitical risks associated with its Taiwan-centric manufacturing base, TSMC is expanding its operations globally. the company is establishing advanced manufacturing facilities in Arizona, Japan, and Germany, supported by strategic partnerships and government subsidies. the Arizona plant is expected to produce 3-nm chips by 2025, aligning TSMC with U.S. efforts to strengthen domestic semiconductor supply chains. TSMC: Financial Overview Metric Value 5-Year Stock Return 252% Year-to-Date Stock Increase 18.1% Q1 Revenue growth (Year-over-Year) 35% Forward Earnings Multiple 24x TSMC's manufacturing leadership is difficult to replicate. Its yields, scale, and talent pool position it as the global leader, providing a significant first-mover advantage. Analysts expect TSMC's earnings to increase by 34.1% in 2025 and another 15% in 2026. With a forward earnings multiple of around 24x, TSMC offers a more conservative entry point compared to Nvidia, which trades at 36x forward earnings. Wall Street analysts have a “Strong Buy” rating on TSMC stock. Among the 11 analysts covering the stock, eight have a “Strong Buy” suggestion, two rate it a “Moderate Buy,” and one recommends a “Hold.” The average analyst target price of $233.12 aligns with its current price, while the Street-high estimate of $259 suggests a potential rally of up to 11% over the next 12 months. C3.ai: Enterprise AI Solutions C3.ai (AI), valued at $3.3 billion, is an AI company focused on enterprise AI solutions. While Nvidia provides the chips, C3.ai enables businesses to leverage AI to address practical, high-value challenges across industries.

Hace chips diseñados por compañías como Nvidia, Apple (AAPL), Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) y Qualcomm (QCOM). Esencialmente, sin TSMC, la revolución de IA carecería del hardware necesario. Las acciones de TSM han devuelto un 252% en los últimos cinco años. En lo que va del año, la acción ha aumentado un 18.1%, superando la ganancia del 5.7% en el índice S&P 500 ($ SPX). www.barchart.com TSMC ha creado un foso competitivo impresionante al permanecer tecnológicamente anticipado y cultivar relaciones a largo plazo con los titanes de la industria. Nvidia, uno de sus clientes más grandes, utiliza TSMC para fabricar chips de IA avanzados como el H100 y GH200, que alimentan los centros de datos de IA. Con las ventas de NVIDIA SHOARGE y otras compañías centradas en AI como AMD y Amazon (AMZN) Racing para producir chips personalizados, TSMC está capturando una parte considerable de esta demanda en rápida expansión. En el primer trimestre, los ingresos totales aumentaron un 35% año tras año a $ 25.5 mil millones. La gerencia declaró que “las tecnologías de 7 nanométricas y más avanzadas representaron el 73%” de los ingresos totales de la oblea. Las ganancias diluidas por acción aumentaron en un 60,4% en el trimestre. Las preocupaciones geopolíticas se han avanzado en general sobre TSMC debido a su base de fabricación centrada en Taiwán. Sin embargo, la compañía está diversificando activamente su huella. TSMC está desarrollando instalaciones de fabricación avanzadas en Arizona, Japón y Alemania con la ayuda de asociaciones estratégicas y subsidios gubernamentales. Se espera que la planta de Arizona, en particular, produzca chips de 3 nm para 2025, colocándola entre las instalaciones más avanzadas en los EE. UU. Esto reduce los riesgos geopolíticos y alinea TSMC con los esfuerzos de los Estados Unidos para localizar las cadenas de suministro de semiconductores. La historia continúa Es difícil igualar el liderazgo de fabricación de TSMC.

Britain's queen consort and reigning monarch are on a tour of the country as part of Royal Week, making stops at receptions and special commemorations. For the annual visit, Queen Camilla went back into her royal wardrobe and opted for a dress courtesy of one of her go-to designers: Fiona Clare. The queen consort re-wore a floral dress, with long sleeves, rounded shoulders and a slightly flared skirt. The dress featured a base fabric of cream with cascading florals in shades of blue, pink and fuchsia running down the fabric. Queen Camilla accessorized her dress with a strand of pearls as well as her Van Cleef & Arpels bracelet, a brand she consistently styles with her sartorial statements. Finishing touches included coordinated pearl earrings and a pair of Chanel cap toe suede satin low heel pumps in beige and black — another staple piece of the queen consort's wardrobe. While attending the commemoration for a memorial stone for Queen Elizabeth II in St Giles Cathedral in Edinburgh, Queen Camilla wrapped up in a coat by Anna Valentine, one of her other favorite designers. Queen Camilla previously wore this Fiona Clare design last May. The queen styled the frock for the commemoration of the 100th anniversary of Canada House in London. The High Commission of Canada in the U.K. officially opened on June 29, 1925, by King George V, King Charles' maternal great-grandfather. The queen consort also replicated this look from last year's trip to Scotland in July 2024. The British royal family member wore the dress for a celebration of individuals who promote Scottish Literacy at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh exactly one year ago. Royal rewears are a signature part of Queen Camilla's wardrobe. The queen consort consistently repurposes dresses by Fiona Clare and Anna Valentine. Kate Middleton is also dedicated to the trend, rewearing pieces by Self-Portrait, Emilia Wickstead and more.

tw_sl_8b94fa9fa474b71fddcd91f5dd4b3bba,2025-07-03 14:22:47,en,WEB,"  Regent's Park Open Air Theatre has unveiled the first production images for its highly anticipated stage adaptation of Malorie Blackman's beloved novel, Noughts & Crosses. Adapted by Dominic Cooke and directed by Regent's Park Open Air Theatre's Associate Artistic Director, Tinuke Craig, the production is currently captivating audiences until July 26, 2025. The newly released images offer a powerful glimpse into the world of Callum and Sephy, brought to life by Noah Valentine and Corinna Brown respectively. They lead a talented cast that includes Alec Boaden as Jude, Amanda Bright as Jasmine, Wela Mbusi as Mr. Pingule & Governor, and Habib Nasib Nader as Kamal. The extensive ensemble features Halle Brown, Michael Cusick, Elle Davies, Eddie Elliott, Emma Jane Goodwin, Kate Kordel, Jessica Layde, Yolanda Ovide, Helena Pipe, Richard Riddell, Ben Skym, and Chanel Waddock. This new production marks Tinuke Craig's Regent's Park Open Air Theatre debut, bringing her vision to Cooke's ""excellent adaptation"" of Blackman's seminal work. The creative team boasts industry veterans including Max Pappenheim (Sound Designer), Joshua Pharo (Lighting Designer), Colin Richmond (Set & Costume Designer), and DJ Walde (Composer). Widely hailed as one of the 21st century's most important novels, Noughts & Crosses presents a bittersweet love story reminiscent of Romeo & Juliet, set against the backdrop of a deeply divided society. The play follows Callum, a Nought, and Sephy, a Cross, as their lifelong friendship navigates a world consumed by racial prejudice and fear. When Callum gains acceptance to Sephy's prestigious Cross school, their secret meetings on a secluded beach are threatened by the escalating tensions that surround them. With its poignant narrative and strong cast, Noughts & Crosses promises to be a compelling and timely theatrical event in the unique setting of the Open Air Theatre. Picture credit: Manuel Harlan"

Then came Cannes Lions 2025 — an energizing deep dive into creativity, strategy, and innovation. From panels and networking events at Amazon Ads, OUTFRONT Media, MediaLink, and Havas, to daily conversations with professionals leading the charge in our industry, I walked away truly inspired. What fascinated me most? The shared drive across every brand, agency, and platform to embrace and integrate AI — not just as a tool, but as a transformational force in marketing and creative strategy.

Também declara ter se hospedado em um hotel que teria custado quase R$ 1 milhão e ameaça censurar os críticos por meio do ministro Alexandre de Moraes, do Supremo Tribunal Federal (STF). Em determinado momento, o vídeo faz menção ao episódio em que Janja pegou carona em um avião da FAB para ir a uma consulta com um ginecologista em São Paulo, o que de fato aconteceu. A defesa apresentada foi que Janja viajou de carona com o ministro Alexandre de Moraes, a esposa dele, Viviane Barci, e o ministro da Justiça, Ricardo Lewandowski, que foi quem requisitou a aeronave. Não tendo, então, custos adicionais para a União. Todas as declarações do vídeo são apresentadas como se fossem falas da própria Janja.

Die französische Designerin revolutionierte mit ihrer klaren Linie und dem „Kleinen Schwarzen“ nicht nur den Stil der Frau, sondern auch ihr Selbstverständnis. Sie war mehr als nur eine Stilikone – sie war eine mutige Pionierin, die mit Konventionen brach und Frauen dazu ermutigte, unabhängig zu denken, zu leben und zu lieben. Ihre Worte sind bis heute legendär und spiegeln ihr einzigartiges Lebensgefühl wider: elegant, selbstbewusst und voller Visionen. Tolle Zitate gibt es nicht nur von Modeschöpfer*innen oder Schriftsteller*innen. Wir finden sie auch in so mancher Serie. Hier zeigen wir euch die besten Zitate von Walter White aus „Breaking Bad“. Das sind 11 grandiose Zitate von Coco Chanel Coco Chanel war mehr als eine Designerin – sie war eine Visionärin. Ihre Zitate inspirieren noch heute zu Selbstbewusstsein, Eleganz und Mut zur Individualität. „Mode ist nicht etwas, das nur in Kleidung existiert. Mode ist in der Luft, auf der Straße – Mode hat mit Ideen zu tun, mit der Art, wie wir leben, mit dem, was passiert. “ „Die meisten Frauen wählen ihr Nachthemd mit mehr Verstand als ihren Mann. “ „Es ist besonders schwer zu schweigen, wenn man nichts zu sagen hat. “ „Eleganz heißt nicht, ins Auge zu fallen, sondern im Gedächtnis zu bleiben. “ „Ich liebe es, Geld zu verdienen. Und ich liebe es, es auszugeben. “ „Ich bin gegen Mode, die vergänglich ist. Ich kann nicht akzeptieren, dass man Kleider wegwirft, nur weil Frühling ist. “ „Weil Geld etwas Sündiges ist, muss es verschleudert werden. “ „Ich bereue nichts im Leben, außer das, was ich nicht getan habe. “ „Mode ist vergänglich. Stil niemals. “ „Nichts macht eine Frau so alt wie der Versuch, jung auszusehen. “ „Eine Frau, die kein Parfum trägt, hat keine Zukunft. “ Mal lustig, mal tiefgründig – erkennt ihr, aus welchen Disney-Filmen diese Zitate stammen? In diesen Filmen wurde das Leben Coco Chanels beleuchtet Das Leben von Coco Chanel wurde mehrfach verfilmt, doch drei Produktionen gehören zu den eindrucksvollsten Annäherungen an eine außergewöhnliche Persönlichkeit: „Coco Chanel – Der Beginn einer Leidenschaft“ mit Audrey Tautou in der Hauptrolle wurde für einen Oscar nominiert und zeigt, wie aus einer rebellischen jungen Frau eine Modeikone wurde.

She was born on February 23, 1959, in Upland, California to the late Leonard and Eleanor Lowndes, and was the beloved wife of 44 years to James T. Pfeiffer. Diana dedicated the first 20 years of her marriage to raising her four children and managing the household while her husband worked long hours for the Metro-North Commuter Railroad. There came a time when God placed the desire on her heart to return to work. By pursuing new professional opportunities with focus and determination, Diana embraced that challenge wholeheartedly. She began her career as a certified paralegal before transitioning into the banking industry, where her leadership and insight truly shined. At Sikorsky Credit Union, Diana led a department focused on loan servicing and loss mitigation. She was a respected voice in her field, even addressing the Connecticut State Legislature on banking regulations on multiple occasions, and ultimately rose to the role of Vice President. Her professional journey stands as a powerful testament to her intelligence, adaptability, and grit. Diana found joy in life's simple pleasures and delighted in sharing them with those she loved. An avid gardener, she took special pride in her dahlias and peonies, often clipping them to brighten her home and others'. A talented cook and baker, she brought people together through her meals, especially during cherished Christmas, Thanksgiving and Easter gatherings. She loved her daily cup of tea and jumped at the opportunity for impromptu tea parties with homemade cookies served on her finest china. Diana was known for her impeccable sense of style and love of makeup, and the timeless scent of her signature Chanel No. 5 perfume. Her strong faith in God guided her life, and her favorite moments were spent lakeside in New Hampshire with her beloved husband and family. Behind closed doors, Diana was the heart of the home - quick with a hug, always checking in to make sure you were okay, and never too serious to be silly. She had an infectious, unmistakable laugh and delighted in playful moments with her children and grandchildren. She wasn't afraid to poke fun at herself, often being the first to make everyone else smile. Fried Green Tomatoes was her favorite movie, and like the women in that story, she lived with heart, humor, and fierce devotion to those she loved. She adored piano music and could often be heard in the kitchen yelling at Alexa to “Skip!” when a song didn't suit her mood - a sound that always made the family smile. In addition to her beloved husband Jim, she is survived by their four children: James L. Pfeiffer (Priscilla), Andrew Pfeiffer (Jessica), Christina Das (Pratik), and Alexandra Pfeiffer; four cherished grandchildren: Ethan J. Pfeiffer, Lucas Kaesmann, Ryan Pfeiffer, and Penelope Das; her sister Ellen Winslow; brothers-in-law William Pfeiffer and Donald Pfeiffer; and many extended family and friends. Family and friends are invited to gather on Thursday, July 10, 2025, from 4:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. at the Cody-White Funeral Home, 107 Broad Street, Milford. A Funeral Service will be celebrated on Friday, July 11, 2025, at 10:00 a.m. at Wildermere Beach Congregational Church, 133 Broadway, Milford, CT 06460 (MEET DIRECTLY AT CHURCH).

Ambas producciones irán de la mano y se estrenarán el próximo 18 de julio en la plataforma de streaming. Por un lado, la serie se basa en hechos reales y, en sus seis capítulos, reimagina el fenómeno televisivo de los 2000. Ese período tuvo como protagonistas a la cantante Yurena, que comenzó su andadura artística como Tamara, y a los pintorescos Paco Porras, Loly Álvarez, Leonardo Dantés o Tony Genil. La ficción está producida por los Javis y ha sido creada y dirigida por Nacho Vigalondo. El documental, por su parte, recoge los testimonios de los verdaderos protagonistas de la citada serie. Según ha adelantado 'verTele!' , ""es una inmersión emocional en el archivo televisivo y cultural de la España de los 2000. Por primera vez, Yurena se desnuda ante las cámaras para ofrecer un testimonio íntimo y revelador, en una narrativa que combina desenfreno mediático, sensibilidad personal y una música que marcó a toda una generación"". Presentación de 'Superestar' El Palacio de la Prensa de Madrid ha sido el lugar escogido para presentar la serie, donde Netflix ha recreado una entrega del ficticio programa 'Tiempo de Marte'. Allí ha estado presente la protagonista, quien le ha dado las gracias a la plataforma ""por hacer que se haga justicia después de tantos años"". El espacio, que aparece en la serie 'Superestar' presentado por el propio Vigalondo, viene a ser un trasunto de 'Crónicas marcianas', el show real que presentó Javier Sardá y que sirvió de gran trampolín a la hora de popularizar a Tamara y todos los singulares personajes que componían su universo. Como colofón del evento, y entre lágrimas, la cantante se reencontró con Ingrid García-Jonsson, la actriz que encarna a la cantante en la serie. ""Has hecho una gran interpretación porque tienes un corazón de oro y una empatía tremenda. Gracias preciosa mía, jamás lo olvidaré. Te quiero"", ha proclamado Yurena, que le ha entregado a la actriz un ramo de flores. ""Ojalá esta serie le dé el cariño que no se le dio en su momento"", ha proclamado García-Jonsson, que ha asegurado que trabajó su recreación de la figura de Tamara/Yurena desde ""el amor"". ""Yo creo que si una persona confía en ti para que cuentes su vida en una ficción tan alocada, lo único que puedes devolverle es amor"", ha afirmado la actriz, que calificó de ""regalazo"" el papel protagonista de 'Superestar'. Además de ser muy exigente desde el punto de vista interpretativo, también ""es muy jugón"", ya que ""te permite enseñar muchas caras del personaje, incluso caras que jamás te imaginarías"". Además de Yurena, la presentación contó también con la participación de Samantha Ballentines, la cantante Luna Ki y Esty Quesada, así como con la presencia en el patio de butacas de rostros conocidos como Samantha Hudson, Yenesi, Alex Saint, Brays Efe, Javi Hoyos, Inés Hernand, Alex de Lucas, Pitita Queen, Lola Rodríguez, Oro Jondo, Hornella Góngora, Arantxa Castilla-La Mancha o Chanel Anorex, entre otros. ""Con el cambio de siglo, un cometa atravesó el cielo de España, desmontando las leyes de la fama y el éxito, desintegrando la frontera entre lo popular y lo underground. Durante un par de años, las portadas y las horas de prime time fueron conquistadas por famosos de otra dimensión. Criaturas que hasta entonces parecían condenadas a la burla y el desprecio y que acapararon nuestra atención sin adaptarse a ninguna normalidad. Un relato mágico donde caben conspiraciones esotéricas, noches eternas, ladrillos cuánticos, supervillanos multicolores y una improbabilidad hecha estrella: Tamara"", reza la sinopsis oficial de la serie cuyos seis capítulos llegan el 18 de julio a Netflix."

On one end of the spectrum you've got Hailey Bieber in a sexy black lace bodysuit, corp-core trousers, kitten heel sandals, and a black leather blazer for an unseasonably cool night in WeHo. Then, there's the 28-year-old Daisy Jones & the Six actor, who was dressed in a simple white T-shirt and breezy white boho skirt, which she paired with particularly feminine Chanel accessories, including a quilted black hobo bag with gold hardware and matching ballet flats with dainty ankle bracelet straps. Hailey Bieber and Camila Morrone enjoy a dinner outing together at Sushi Park in West Hollywood on July 2, 2025. PEGR, ROLO From head to toe, literally nothing about these looks were the same: Morrone wore her hair in beachy waves while Bieber went for a pin-straight look. Morrone's glasses were oversized while Bieber wore her signature skinny black shades. As for summer mani-pedis, Morrone rocked cherry red nails as Bieber ditched her Rhode-themed lemon dropped manicure for a subtle French design and reaffirmed her commitment to the bare pedicure trend. Of course, we can't say what pedicure Morrone favors because she opted for closed-toed flats. Hailey Bieber on July 2, 2025.

mov_704091AE2C48A8CA324B5D065F68B28F,2025-07-03 19:48:04,en,WEB,"  For over 350 years, a familiar name has woven itself into the fabric of Canadian identity: Hudson's Bay. More than just a department store, it's a national symbol – a place where generations have celebrated milestones, discovered cherished products, and experienced the evolving heartbeat of Canadian retail. Today, Hudson Bay Retail Innovations are not merely adapting to change; they are driving it. From its iconic striped point blankets to cutting-edge digital experiences, Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) leverages its deep heritage to pioneer the future of shopping. This blend of timeless trust and bold technological advancement positions HBC as the undisputed leader in Canada's department store evolution, constantly redefining what it means to serve the modern consumer while honoring a legacy that began with European fur traders and Indigenous communities shaping the nation's early economy. The Hudson Bay Retail Innovations strategy masterfully balances this rich history with a relentless push towards convenience, personalization, and sustainability, ensuring its stripes remain synonymous with Canadian retail excellence. Hudson Bay Retail Innovations: Brand Overview and Market Leadership Hudson's Bay Company isn't just a retailer; it's a Canadian institution commanding unparalleled market position within the department store sector. Founded in 1670 by royal charter, HBC boasts the title of North America's oldest continually operating company. Its global recognition stems from this extraordinary heritage, but its current leadership status is fueled by a deliberate strategy: merging legacy with cutting-edge innovation. The brand's reputation rests on a powerful trifecta – innovation seen in its seamless omnichannel experiences, uncompromising quality across exclusive labels like GlucksteinHome and popular national brands, and profound consumer trust earned over centuries. This trust translates into tangible influence; HBC sets seasonal trends, impacts consumer spending habits nationwide, and serves as a bellwether for the health of Canadian retail. Its physical stores, including flagship locations in Toronto, Vancouver, and Montreal, are more than shopping destinations; they are curated experiences blending history (showcasing heritage artifacts) with modernity (interactive screens, tech-enabled fitting rooms). Simultaneously, HBC's robust e-commerce platform, continuously refined through Hudson Bay Retail Innovations , ensures it meets customers wherever they are, offering same-day delivery in major cities and sophisticated AI-driven recommendations. The company's Hudson Bay Retail Innovations consistently prioritize customer-centricity, ensuring its market position remains resilient against digital-native competitors and shifting economic tides. Recent recognitions, such as high rankings in customer satisfaction surveys for department stores, further cement its leadership. HBC's ability to leverage its vast historical data alongside real-time analytics allows for unprecedented personalization, making every interaction feel bespoke – a key differentiator in today's crowded market. This strategic blend of tradition and technology defines its unique global recognition as a retail pioneer. For deeper insights into evolving retail strategies in competitive markets, explore our analysis on global retail transformation trends and the impact of consumer behavior shifts in Canada . The Storied Journey: Hudson's Bay Origins and Evolution The history of Hudson's Bay Company is inextricably linked to the very evolution of Canada itself. Chartered on May 2, 1670, by King Charles II of England, the “Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay” began as a fur trading enterprise. Its initial purpose was to establish a lucrative trade network for beaver pelts, primarily with Indigenous peoples across the vast watershed draining into Hudson Bay – territory granted by the charter and known as Rupert's Land. Early trading posts, like York Factory (founded 1684), became critical hubs. Key milestones defined its rise: 1670: Royal Charter granted, creating HBC. 1821: Merger with the rival North West Company, solidifying its dominance over the North American fur trade. 1869: Sale of Rupert's Land to the newly formed Dominion of Canada, shifting HBC's focus from land governance to retail and real estate. 1881: Opening of the first true department store in Winnipeg, Manitoba, marking the formal transition from fur trading to diversified retail. 1913: Launch of the iconic Hudson's Bay Point Blanket, originally a trade good, becoming a national symbol. 1960s-1970s: Rapid national expansion, acquiring other retailers like Zellers (1978) and establishing a coast-to-coast presence. 2008: Acquisition by NRDC Equity Partners, leading to significant restructuring and modernization efforts. 2010s-Present: Embracing digital transformation, launching HBC Global, expanding e-commerce, and focusing on premium retail experiences. This evolution wasn't linear. HBC navigated economic depressions, fierce competition (notably from Eaton's and Simpsons), and the decline of fur trading. Its survival and adaptation showcase remarkable resilience. The shift from trading posts to grand urban department stores in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was pivotal. Landmark stores like the Toronto Queen Street flagship (1930s) became architectural icons and community anchors. The acquisition strategy broadened its reach and brand portfolio, though managing these integrations presented challenges. The modern Hudson Bay Retail Innovations era, driven heavily by digital investment since the 2010s, represents the latest chapter in this centuries-long evolution , transforming the company from a traditional brick-and-mortar giant into an agile omnichannel leader. Key figures like Governor Sir George Simpson in the fur trade era and more recent CEOs like Richard Baker and Iain Nairn have steered its course through these transformative phases. Key Products and Services: Shaping Canadian Consumerism Hudson's Bay has profoundly shaped Canadian consumer behavior through its diverse and trendsetting product offerings . Its services extend beyond mere transactions, creating a comprehensive shopping ecosystem: Iconic & Best-Selling Products:   The Point Blanket: The quintessential Canadian symbol. Originally a wool trade blanket marked with distinctive black stripes, it remains a top seller, now extended into apparel, home décor, and collaborations. Its heritage drives enduring appeal. Exclusive Labels: HBC developed powerful private brands that defined quality and style for generations. Simpsons-Sears catalogs (post-1952 acquisition) brought affordable fashion to millions. Modern exclusives like Top of the World (outerwear), GlucksteinHome (luxury bedding and furniture), and HBC Collection (contemporary apparel and accessories) offer unique value and design...."

The 30-second video, photographed and directed by Stevie Dance and styled by Anna Trevelyan, follows the storyline of an underground collector tracking down the coveted accessory.

Muchas personas usan el término “perfume” para referirse a cualquier fragancia, pero no todas tienen la misma concentración ni duración. Las diferencias entre un perfume, un eau de parfum y un eau de toilette no solo radican en su nombre, sino también en su composición, intensidad y uso recomendado. Conocer estas variaciones es clave para elegir la opción más adecuada según el estilo de vida, el clima y el presupuesto. En el mercado mexicano, existe una amplia oferta que incluye desde marcas internacionales de alta gama hasta opciones accesibles y funcionales. Cada formato tiene sus ventajas dependiendo del contexto: si se busca una fragancia duradera para un evento especial, o algo más fresco y liviano para el día a día. Comprender estas diferencias ayuda a evitar errores comunes, cómo comprar una fragancia demasiado intensa para el uso diario. Este artículo detalla las particularidades de cada tipo de producto, presenta ejemplos representativos y ofrece recomendaciones prácticas para encontrar la fragancia ideal, ya sea de firmas de lujo o de marcas populares como los perfumes Aeropostale, Calvin Klein, Zara o Tous. Diferencias fundamentales entre las concentraciones Cada tipo de fragancia tiene una formulación distinta que influye directamente en su duración y proyección. ¿Qué es un perfume? El perfume o extrait de parfum es el formato más concentrado. Su contenido de aceites esenciales suele estar entre el 20 % y el 30 %, lo que le confiere una duración prolongada, a veces superior a 12 horas en la piel. Este tipo de fragancia es más costosa, pero también más persistente y sofisticada. Ejemplos comunes de perfumes concentrados incluyen Chanel No. 5 Extrait, Dior J'adore L'Absolu o Amouage Interlude Woman. Por su intensidad, se recomienda aplicarlos con moderación y reservarlos para eventos especiales o climas fríos, donde pueden desplegar todo su potencial sin resultar abrumadores. ¿Qué es un eau de parfum? El eau de parfum (EDP) es uno de los formatos más populares por su equilibrio entre duración y precio. Su concentración oscila entre el 15 % y el 20 %, lo que permite una fijación duradera de 6 a 8 horas, dependiendo del tipo de piel y las condiciones ambientales. Marcas como Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Carolina Herrera Good Girl, Montblanc Signature o los perfumes Aeropostale en su versión EDP son buenos ejemplos de esta categoría. Estas fragancias son ideales para el uso diario en ambientes cerrados o para quienes desean un aroma que permanezca durante toda la jornada. ¿Qué es un eau de toilette? El eau de toilette (EDT) contiene entre un 5 % y un 15 % de aceites aromáticos. Esto la convierte en una opción más ligera, con una duración que va de 3 a 5 horas. Es perfecta para climas cálidos, momentos casuales o como fragancia de reaplicación a lo largo del día. Algunos EDT populares son CK One, Versace Pour Femme Dylan Blue, Tous Touch o Light Blue de Dolce & Gabbana en su versión ligera. Son recomendables para quienes prefieren aromas sutiles y frescos que no invadan el espacio personal. Aplicaciones prácticas según el estilo de vida Cada formato responde a un tipo de uso diferente, según la ocasión y la rutina personal. Fragancias para el trabajo y el día a día Para entornos laborales o actividades cotidianas, el eau de toilette suele ser la mejor elección. Su ligereza evita que el aroma resulte molesto para los demás, y su frescura aporta una sensación de limpieza. También es común reaplicar este tipo de fragancia a lo largo del día sin saturar. Marcas como Zara, Burberry Weekend, Benetton Colors, o los perfumes Aeropostale presentan opciones adecuadas para este perfil de uso, especialmente en oficinas o ambientes escolares. Fragancias para eventos especiales Cuando se necesita una fragancia más notoria y duradera, como en bodas, cenas o reuniones nocturnas, lo ideal es optar por un perfume o un buen eau de parfum. Estas versiones logran mayor permanencia y proyección, creando una estela más distintiva. Algunas recomendaciones incluyen Lancome La Vie Est Belle, Tom Ford Black Orchid, Mugler Alien o Elie Saab Le Parfum. Estos productos se comportan bien en pieles secas o en climas templados. Cómo identificar el tipo de concentración Es clave revisar la etiqueta y los detalles del envase antes de comprar una fragancia. Qué buscar en la botella o caja Los productos suelen indicar claramente si se trata de un perfume, eau de parfum o eau de toilette. Estas leyendas aparecen junto al nombre de la fragancia, por lo general en francés. En caso de duda, también se puede consultar el porcentaje de concentración en la lista de ingredientes. Además, algunas marcas ofrecen el mismo aroma en diferentes concentraciones. Por ejemplo, Chanel Coco Mademoiselle tiene versiones tanto EDP cómo EDT, cada una con una estructura olfativa ligeramente distinta, pero fiel al ADN del perfume. Consideraciones al comprar en línea Cuando se adquiere una fragancia por internet, especialmente en tiendas mexicanas como Liverpool, Sears, Sanborns o Amazon México, es fundamental verificar la descripción del producto...."
n17ylw6,2025-07-04 00:01:28,en,REDDIT,"  Well, as you should know, a large fraction--but not majority--of people here purchase luxury handbags associated with Houses that have been in the industry for a *long* time. Your brand, unfortunately, won't reach a cult following any time soon; it takes decades to build and maintain that. So I would recommend you *not* rely on logo hardware or monograms of any sort. Every brand has a ""story"". It's a marketing tactic. I recommend you come up with one, and it doesn't have to be 100% true. You are welcome to embellish. You'd be surprised what a story can do. Chanel was a dying brand until Karl Lagerfeld took over. He reinvented the lore for the dying house and made Coco Chanel seem like the pinnacle of upper class from rags to riches (while simultaneously hiding her Nazi connections). What he did for the brand is immeasurable. Anyway, yeah, a good story always helps. Pick out your niche. What differentiates you from ""other"" handbag brands? Every brand is known for *something* . I wouldn't recommend going for ""all our pieces are unique and handcrafted by the finest artisans"" or ""made with the higest quality leathers"" as that has been over done and means very little to those actually into handbags. You need to pick a group--like age range and social economic status--you wish to appeal to. Have a distinct House code/style. You want to stick out. Having themes in your collection or iconic prints will help people recognise your product from afar. Think Chanel's quilted pattern, Burberry's Nova Check print, Versace's embellishments and safety pins, etc. All these repeat features help create world building, as we call it in the fashion world. Also, social media. I can't stress that enough."

mov_CBCDB103AAAB757D05E8E2B5A8121AA9,2025-07-04 00:43:28,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Ciudad de México a 03 de julio de 2025.- ¿Qué tan cerca está la inspiración del riesgo  legal? En redes sociales y marketplaces proliferan productos que imitan a marcas  reconocidas como Nike, Apple o Chanel. Aunque muchos se promocionan como “similares”  o “inspirados en”, estas prácticas pueden constituir una infracción a los derechos de  propiedad intelectual, con consecuencias tanto legales como reputacionales para  fabricantes, distribuidores y vendedores. Frente a este fenómeno, las empresas han reforzado sus estrategias de protección. Marcas  globales ya implementan inteligencia artificial para detectar imitaciones en tiempo real,  mientras plataformas como Instagram, TikTok y Facebook bloquean perfiles y eliminan  contenido que infringe marcas registradas. En 2023, Amazon reportó la cancelación de más  de 700,000 cuentas de vendedores por este tipo de violaciones, lo que refleja la magnitud  del problema y el papel clave que juega la tecnología en la defensa del valor de marca. Desde réplicas de perfumes hasta bolsos de diseñador o dispositivos electrónicos, la  imitación comercial se ha normalizado tanto en entornos digitales como físicos. Aunque  muchos vendedores y compradores creen que no hay consecuencias si se aclara que un  artículo no es original, la ley dice lo contrario. “En muchos casos, las personas ni siquiera  saben que están cometiendo una infracción. Pero el desconocimiento no elimina las  consecuencias” , advierte Diana Karina Martínez, Of Counsel del área de Enforcement de la  firma Arochi & Lindner. La frontera entre la inspiración y la ilegalidad se cruza cuando se reproducen nombres,  logotipos, empaques o elementos distintivos que pueden generar confusión. Esto no solo  representa un riesgo legal para quien fabrica o comercializa estos productos, sino también  una amenaza directa a la reputación de marcas consolidadas y a la confianza del  consumidor. Por ello, Martínez recomienda a emprendedores y empresas tener claridad  sobre lo que la ley permite y fortalecer sus prácticas de cumplimiento: 1. Evita usar nombres o logotipos de marcas registradas: Frases como “inspirado  en…” o “parecido a…” pueden violar la ley, incluso si se aclara que no son originales. 2. Limita el uso de empaques o diseños que generen confusión: La legislación  protege no solo el nombre, sino también la imagen, colores y estilo distintivo de una  marca. 3. Apuesta por productos originales o claramente diferenciados: Si un producto  parece una copia, probablemente lo es. Optar por lo auténtico es también una  estrategia de valor. 4. Verifica antes de comercializar o revender: Asegúrate de que los artículos que  distribuyes no infringen marcas. Solicita licencias o comprobantes si es necesario. 5. Infórmate sobre tus derechos y obligaciones: El portal del IMPI ofrece recursos  accesibles para empresas y profesionales que buscan actuar dentro del marco legal. La propiedad intelectual fortalece los activos intangibles de una empresa, construye  confianza con los consumidores y aporta valor competitivo a largo plazo. Elegir productos originales, desarrollar propuestas auténticas y respetar lo que otros han construido se  integra a un entorno empresarial donde la innovación se valora y las marcas generan  impacto sostenible. En una era donde todo está al alcance de un clic, actuar con conciencia  marca la diferencia. Lo que parece una oportunidad hoy puede convertirse en un riesgo  mañana. Elegir lo legal fortalece tu credibilidad y te abre oportunidades reales. Sobre Arochi & Lindner Arochi & Lindner es una firma legal con más de 30 años de experiencia y reconocida como referente internacional en propiedad  intelectual, litigio estratégico y asesoría jurídica especializada para industrias altamente reguladas.

En sus seis capítulos, la ficción basada en hechos reales reimagina el fenómeno televisivo de los 2000, que tuvo como protagonistas a la cantante Yurena -que comenzó su andadura artística como Tamara- y a los pintorescos Paco Porras, Loly Álvarez, Leonardo Dantés o Tony Genil. ""Gracias Suma Content. Gracias Netflix por hacer que se haga justicia después de tantos años. Os quiero"", afirmó una emocionada Yurena, que subió al escenario del Palacio de la Prensa de Madrid, donde Netflix recreó una entrega del ficticio programa 'Tiempo de Marte'. El espacio, que aparece en la serie Superestar presentado por el propio Vigalondo, viene a ser un trasunto de Crónicas marcianas, el show real que presentó Javier Sardá y que sirvió de gran trampolín a la hora de popularizar a Tamara y todos los singulares personajes que componían su universo. Como colofón del evento, y entre lágrimas, la cantante se reencontró con Ingrid García-Jonsson, la actriz que encarna a la cantante en la serie. ""Has hecho una gran interpretación porque tienes un corazón de oro y una empatía tremenda. Gracias preciosa mía, jamás lo olvidaré. Te quiero"", proclamó Yurena, que le entregó a la actriz un ramo de flores. ""Ojalá esta serie le dé el cariño que no se le dio en su momento"", proclamó García-Jonsson, que aseguró que trabajó su recreación de la figura de Tamara/Yurena desde ""el amor"". ""Yo creo que si una persona confía en ti para que cuentes su vida en una ficción tan alocada, lo único que puedes devolverle es amor"", afirmó la actriz, que calificó de ""regalazo"" el papel protagonista de Superestar. Además de ser muy exigente desde el punto de vista interpretativo, también ""es muy jugón"", ya que ""te permite enseñar muchas caras del personaje, incluso caras que jamás te imaginarías"". [embedded content] 'Superestar' + Google, combinación imbatible ""Realmente no sabemos si la serie va a funcionar mejor con la gente que lo recuerda todo o con esa otra gente que va a flipar sin saber nada, esos que luego van a ir a Google a comprobar lo que es verdadero y lo que no"", apuntó Vigalondo, que en su libre recreación del fenómeno televisivo del 'tamarismo' ha incluido elementos ""fantásticos o de ciencia ficción"", pero avisó que, a pesar de que ""hay cosas que lo van a parecer, van a parecer fantasía, pero sucedieron de verdad"". ""Hay cosas que la gente va a creer que nos hemos inventado, pero que han pasado. Lo más 'heavy' ha pasado de verdad"", secunda Claudia Costafreda, codirectora de la ficción, que asegura que con esta serie han tocado techo profesionalmente. ""Estamos jodidos con este tema. Hay una sensación de que nada será ya como esto. Es como 'Wonderwall' para Oasis"", bromeó Vigalondo. ""Gracias a los que habéis participado en esta serie porque nos habéis castrado artísticamente para siempre"", proclamó el director, que, sobre una posible segunda temporada, señaló que será ""lo que diga don Joseph Netflix, que es el único que sabe lo que puede pasar"". Por el ficticio plató de Tiempo de Marte, en el que Vigalondo estuvo acompañado de Aníbal Gómez y Paula Púa, también pasaron el resto de los actores principales de la serie, Natalia de Molina (Loly Álvarez), Secun de la Rosa (Leonardo Dantés), Pepón Nieto (Tony Genil), Julián Villagrán (Arlequín), Carlos Areces (Paco Porras) o Rocío Ibáñez (Margarita Seisdedos). Además de Yurena, la presentación contó también con la participación de Samantha Ballentines, la cantante Luna Ki y Esty Quesada, así como con la presencia en el patio de butacas de rostros conocidos como Samantha Hudson, Yenesi, Alex Saint, Brays Efe, Javi Hoyos, Inés Hernand, Alex de Lucas, Pitita Queen, Lola Rodríguez, Oro Jondo, Hornella Góngora, Arantxa Castilla-La Mancha o Chanel Anorex, entre otros. ""Con el cambio de siglo, un cometa atravesó el cielo de España, desmontando las leyes de la fama y el éxito, desintegrando la frontera entre lo popular y lo underground. Durante un par de años, las portadas y las horas de prime time fueron conquistadas por famosos de otra dimensión. Criaturas que hasta entonces parecían condenadas a la burla y el desprecio y que acapararon nuestra atención sin adaptarse a ninguna normalidad. Un relato mágico donde caben conspiraciones esotéricas, noches eternas, ladrillos cuánticos, supervillanos multicolores y una improbabilidad hecha estrella: Tamara"", reza la sinopsis oficial de la serie cuyos seis capítulos llegan el 18 de julio a Netflix."
mov_1B961FE19F4BCC69062CA6E25E5EAA5D,2025-07-04 03:30:40,vi,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Ngày 3/7, TAND TP.Huế (tỉnh Thừa Thiên - Huế) mở phiên tòa xét xử đối với các bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương (SN 1992); Phạm Thanh Long (SN 1992) cùng vợ là Nguyễn Thu Trinh (SN 1992, cùng ngụ P.Xuân Phú, TP.Huế) về tội Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản. Công lý dẫn cáo trạng của VKSND TP.Huế, đầu năm 2021, Lê Thị Hồng Phương bắt đầu kinh doanh online các mặt hàng cao cấp như thực phẩm chức năng, mỹ phẩm, túi xách, nước hoa, đồng hồ... từ các thương hiệu nổi tiếng như Hermes, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Versace... Để có vốn mở rộng quy mô kinh doanh, từ tháng 3/2021, Phương kêu gọi vợ chồng Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh cùng góp vốn đầu tư. Cả ba lập nhóm chat “KIM MONOLOLY GROUP” trên ứng dụng Viber để giao dịch. Phương tự lập các đơn hàng, ghi rõ ngày đi - ngày về và mức lãi suất cao (từ 10% đến 100%) để kêu gọi vốn từ Long, Trinh và những người thân quen của họ. Mỗi đơn hàng có giá trị từ 10 triệu đồng đến hơn 4 tỷ đồng. Việc góp vốn diễn ra suôn sẻ, lợi nhuận cao khiến nhiều người tiếp tục tham gia. Vợ chồng Long và Trinh còn hạ mức lãi suất cho các nhà đầu tư cấp dưới để hưởng chênh lệch từ mức lãi suất mà Phương cam kết. Tuy nhiên, sau một thời gian, hoạt động kinh doanh thua lỗ, hàng hóa không tiêu thụ được khiến Phương mất khả năng chi trả. Để tiếp tục duy trì dòng tiền và trả lãi cho các đơn cũ, Phương lập các đơn hàng giả với lãi suất cao để lôi kéo nhà đầu tư mới, thực chất là chiếm đoạt tiền. Các bị cáo tại phiên tòa. (Ảnh: Báo Công an TP.HCM) Từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, Phương đã huy động vốn thông qua 1.158 đơn hàng, nhận tổng cộng 505,16 tỷ đồng, đã tất toán 990 đơn hàng với lãi suất hơn 91,39 tỷ đồng. Còn lại 168 đơn hàng chưa tất toán, tương ứng 112,3 tỷ đồng. Sau khi trừ phần lãi đã trả, số tiền Phương chiếm đoạt thực tế là 20,3 tỷ đồng. Số tiền này được Phương sử dụng vào các mục đích cá nhân như thuê nhà, thuê kho bãi, vận chuyển hàng hóa, xoay vòng dòng tiền và tiêu xài. Đến ngày 12/4/2022, Phương chính thức tuyên bố mất khả năng thanh toán. Riêng đối với Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh, quá trình điều tra cho thấy, từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, hai bị cáo này sử dụng tiền cá nhân, tiền của người thân và tiền của các nhà đầu tư để đầu tư cho Phương. Đáng chú ý, ngay trước thời điểm Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ, ngày 12/4/2022, Phương vẫn gửi 12 đơn hàng với lãi suất từ 6% đến 25% để Long và Trinh tiếp tục huy động vốn. Ba người đầu tư là anh Nguyễn Tiến Phương 500 triệu đồng, chị Ngô Thị Diệu Lý 850 triệu đồng và anh Trần Hùng 794 triệu đồng. Cuối năm 2022, Cơ quan CSĐT Công an tỉnh Thừa Thiên Huế (nay là TP Huế) khởi tố bị can, bắt giữ các đối tượng. Theo tin tức trên báo Công an TP.HCM, sau khi nghị án, HĐXX tuyên phạt Lê Thị Hồng Phương 14 năm tù về tội “Lừa đảo chiếm đoạt tài sản”; Phạm Thanh Long 5 năm tù và Nguyễn Thu Trinh 3 năm 6 tháng tù về tội “Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản”.

mov_30772ECD38EEFE176631EA2BA081B82C,2025-07-04 03:42:40,en,WEB,"  Cinematic Comeback After nearly two decades, the beloved 2006 comedy-drama The Devil Wears Prada is set to return with a sequel in 2026. Disney is currently developing the follow-up movie, with original screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna and director David Frankel on board. The first film followed aspiring journalist Andrea “Andy” Sachs — played by Anne Hathaway — who unexpectedly lands a job at the fictional luxury fashion magazine Runway. Despite her lack of industry knowledge, Andy chooses to endure the relentless demands of editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly (Meryl Streep) and her sharp-tongued assistant Emily Charlton (Emily Blunt). As Andy transforms — in both style and commitment — the job begins to take a toll on her personal life. The original Devil Wears Prada film was adapted from Lauren Weisberger's bestselling novel, which was widely believed to draw from her real-life experiences working under Anna Wintour at Vogue. However, the book faced sharp criticism from within the fashion industry — Vogue editor Kate Betts notably wrote in The New York Times in April 2003, “Andrea is just as much a snob as the snobs she is thrown in with.” The novel was seen by many as a thinly veiled portrayal of Weisberger herself as Andrea “Andy” Sachs, and Anna Wintour as the formidable Miranda Priestly. Despite its critics, the film was a box office triumph, grossing USD 326 million worldwide and securing its legacy as a cultural classic — one that resonated far beyond fashion circles. Beyond the sartorial standouts, the film resonated for its portrayal of self-image, professional sacrifice and the tension between ambition and authenticity — striking a cultural chord with audiences across a range of professional backgrounds. The Sequel 20th Century Studios The sequel will not follow the follow-up novel, which was said to pick up ten years after Andy Sachs' original foray into the fashion world, with the launch of a luxury bridal magazine alongside Emily Charlton. Instead, the film's sequel is set to take a fresh direction around editor-in-chief Miranda Priestly as she grapples with her role in a rapidly changing media industry and the decline of traditional print publishing. Fuelled by its enduring popularity, the long-awaited sequel will see the return of several beloved characters to the silver screen. Meryl Streep reprises her Oscar-nominated role as Miranda Priestly, the formidable editor-in-chief of Runway magazine, complete with the sharp wit and steely expressions that became hallmarks of the character. Anne Hathaway is also set to return as Andy Sachs, despite previously expressing doubts about a sequel in a 2024 interview. She reflected on how the digital age has reshaped fashion and media, remarking, “It would just be very different.” The original 2006 film captured a pre-digital era when print magazines still reigned supreme, before the industry's full pivot to digital platforms. “Maybe me, Stanley, Emily, Meryl, Dave Frankel, Patricia Field… we should just all do something else together. That'd be fun,” she mused. 20th Century Studios Emily Blunt — who played Andy's sharp-tongued colleague Emily Charlton — coyly teased her involvement when asked about production timing, offering only the word “July.” Meanwhile, Stanley Tucci — beloved for his portrayal of Nigel Kipling, Andy's onscreen mentor and stylistic guide — has not yet confirmed his return, though fan excitement around his potential appearance remains high. 20th Century Studios The Rumoured Plot While official plot details remain under wraps, early reports suggest the sequel will explore Miranda Priestly's struggle amid the decline of traditional magazine publishing. Meryl Streep's character is said to face off against Emily Charlton — played by Emily Blunt — who has ascended to a powerful role at a luxury advertising firm, reversing the hierarchical dynamic that once defined their relationship. Whether the sequel can replicate the original film's cultural impact remains uncertain. The 2006 release, though exaggerated for effect, cleverly reinforced — and at times skewered — prevailing stereotypes of the fashion industry, offering a sharply satirical yet recognisable glimpse into its cutthroat work culture. In contrast, the sequel appears poised to lean more heavily into fictional narrative, potentially moving away from the grounded realism that gave the original its resonance. Much speculation surrounds how audiences will respond to the rumoured shift in power between Miranda and Emily. While such a development could reflect a natural evolution in character arcs, it may not deliver the same compelling tension that defined the original. After all, much of the first film's enduring appeal hinged on Streep's commanding performance as Miranda — the titular “devil” — whose icy authority anchored the story. Elevating Emily to the top could risk diluting that dynamic, leaving audiences to wonder whether the magic can strike twice. Read More: Chanel Helps To Bring Singapore Filmmaker Eric Khoo's 'Spirit World' To Life Fashion insiders — particularly those in media and publishing — will certainly be intrigued to see how the sequel navigates the evolving relationship between editorial and brand advertising. One of the most prominent scenes from the original film — in which Miranda Priestly effortlessly deconstructs the significance of two seemingly identical belts while Andy laughs in naïveté — remains a masterclass in asserting authority and industry insight. It also underscores Miranda's ability to command the room at will, a reflection of the editorial powerhouses that once defined the pre-digital media era. 20th Century Studios Miranda's portrayal of an editor-in-chief in 2006 reflected an era when editors exercised full creative control — curating fashion pages and editorial shoots based largely on personal vision and directional taste. In contrast, today's landscape is increasingly dictated by brand influence, with commercial partners often holding the final say over what makes it to print — and what ends up shelved. This shift mirrors broader changes in the industry. Notably, Anna Wintour recently announced her departure as editor-in-chief of Vogue US after 37 years, choosing instead to focus on her role as chief content officer across Condé Nast. Her transition underscores how the editor-in-chief position — once the highest creative authority — has evolved into a more complex, corporate-facing role shaped by brand strategy and cross-platform priorities. The Real-Life Links Though the sequel is not officially tied to real-world events, its storyline arrives at a fitting moment — particularly as Vogue's longtime editor-in-chief Anna Wintour steps aside after 37 years. Wintour's shift to focus solely on her role as chief content officer across Condé Nast underscores how dramatically the fashion media landscape has evolved — and how the once all-powerful editor-in-chief has become more of a “corporate steward” than “creative gatekeeper”. Wintour has long personified the editorial authority that Miranda Priestly — The Devil Wears Prada's fictional editor-in-chief — so thoroughly represented...."

mov_4065EF5B480AF56E612FC5FC15378ED4,2025-07-04 06:06:00,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Ob zweifarbige Pumps oder T-Steg-Sandalen: Einige Schuhe aus den 80er-Jahren erleben in 2025 ein Comeback. VOGUE verrät, wie sie jetzt kombiniert werden. Diese 5 Schuhe aus den 80ern liegen jetzt wieder im Trend! Die Mode der 80er-Jahre ist schwer zu vergessen – die Schulterpolster zum Beispiel oder die knalligen Farben. Aber auch die ausgefallenen Schuhe aus dem vergangenen Jahrzehnt sind legendär und werden im Sommer 2025 wieder rauf und runter getragen – darunter Ballerinas, Slingbacks oder zweifarbige Pumps. VOGUE verrät, welche Modelle zurück auf dem Laufsteg – und der Straße – sind und wie sie heute kombiniert werden. 5 Modelle aus den 80ern, die im Sommer 2025 wieder angesagt sind #1 Ballerinas In den 30er-Jahren lancierten Designer:innen wie Christian Dior, Elsa Schiaparelli und Yves Saint Laurent die ersten Ballerinas, die nicht nur für ihre Eleganz, sondern auch für ihren Komfort gefeiert wurden. Später dann, in den 80er-Jahren, war auch Prinzessin Diana ein großer Fan der Silhouette; während Kate Moss und Alexa Chung in den späten 2000er- und frühen 2010er-Jahren zu den Anhängerinnen gehörten. Perry Ellis stellte 1987 ein schlichtes weißes Modell vor, das sie gepaart mit einem weißen, geradlinigen Look über den Laufsteg schickte. Nachdem die Modelle dann einige Jahre von der Bildfläche verschwunden waren, bahnten sie sich in den letzten Saisons ihren Weg zurück an die Spitze. Während in den 80er-Jahren aber vorrangig klassische Designs im Vordergrund standen, zeigen sich die Ballerinas heute verspielter – zum Beispiel aus Mesh oder PVC, mit Leoparden- oder Reptilmuster. Bei Chloé präsentierte Chemena Kamali beispielsweise eine geschnürte Boho-Version der Schuhe, die sie zu einem fließenden roséfarbenen Set kombinierte. #2 Slingbacks Apropos elegante Schuhe: Slingback-Modelle, also jene mit Riemchen um die Ferse, gehörten in den 80er-Jahren zur Arbeitsuniform der Frauen. 1987, als das sogenannte Power-Dressing in vollem Gange war, brauchte man ein Design, das bequem, aber dennoch formell war. So wählte Giorgio Armani für seine Kollektion im besagten Jahr Slingbacks, die er zu einer Bundfaltenhose, einer Bluse und einem Blazer mit breiten Schulterpolstern kombinierte. In 2025 kommen Slingbacks besonders gerne mit Kitten Heels daher – wie Marken wie Jacquemus, Contessa Mills und Tamara Ralph bestätigen. Letztere setzte auf eine schwarze Variante der Slingbacks und kombinierte sie mit einer samtigen Off-Shoulder-Bluse und einem Midirock mit Perlenverzierung. #3 T-Steg-Sandalen Sich von vergangenen Jahrzehnten inspirieren zu lassen, ist kein neues Konzept. Und während die Mode der 80er-Jahre der Welt eine Mischung aus Opulenz, Sinnlichkeit und Dramatik bescherte, brachte sie auch viele Elemente der 20er-Jahre zurück – wie lange Halsketten und T-Steg-Sandalen. Givenchy stellte in 1988 beispielsweise ein mit Polka Dots verziertes Modell vor – in Kombination mit einem trägerlosen Kleid im gleichen Muster. Es gab eine Zeit, in der Schuhe mit T-Steg als altmodisch galten. Jetzt, im Sommer 2025, finden die geschichtsträchtigen und mühelos eleganten Schuhe wieder Anklang. Christopher Esber, eine Marke mit australischen Wurzeln, verlieh ihnen mit einer Mesh-Variante und gestylt zum minimalistischen Ensemble aus einem weißen Neckholdertop und einer schwarzen Stoffhose einen modernen Dreh. #4 Oxford-Schuhe In den späten 80er-Jahren begann sich langsam der Minimalismus, der die nächsten Jahre prägen sollte, zu etablieren. Ein Stil, der sich durch androgyne Accessoires – wie zum Beispiel die Oxford-Schuhe – bemerkbar machte. Ralph Lauren hatte sie 1985 bereits mit Absatz vorgestellt; Helmut Lang und Yohji Yamamoto verwischten die Geschlechtergrenzen dann mit Versionen, die fast identisch zu den Herrenschuhen waren. Lang kombinierte sie mit einem langärmeligen Rollkragenkleid, Yamamoto mit einer weißen Oversize-Weste und einem blauen Satinrock. Oxford-Schuhe zogen sich wie ein roter Faden durch die Frühjahr/Sommer-Kollektion 2025 von Loewe. Anstatt sie wie damals zu ebenso androgynen Looks zu stylen, sorgte Jonathan Anderson für einen Stilbruch und kombinierte sie zu romantisch-verspielten Blumen- und Babydoll-Kleidern. #5 Zweifarbige Pumps Das Chanel der 80er-Jahre verkörperte einen Luxus, der sich durch Tweed-Sets, Perlenschmuck – und zweifarbige Pumps auszeichnete. Gründerin Coco Chanel trug oft selbst ein Paar mit niedrigem Absatz. 1982 (ein Jahr bevor Karl Lagerfeld zum französischen Modehaus stieß) sah man zweifarbige Pumps in Kombination mit einem weißen Kleid, einem schwarzen Blazer, Handschuhen, Gürteln und langen Perlenketten auf dem Laufsteg. Während diese klassischen schwarz-cremefarbenen Pumps weiterhin bei Chanel zu sehen sind, gibt es Häuser wie Nina Ricci oder Balmain, die die zweifarbigen Modelle ausgefallener – aber immer noch im gleichen Stil – interpretieren. Balmain setzte für den Sommer 2025 beispielsweise auf eine rot-goldene Version, gepaart mit einem Tweed-Minirock und einer passenden Jacke."
mov_5366E41DC265907BBBCFE664C4955B54,2025-07-04 06:45:55,en,WEB,"  MailOnline has put a list together of the glamorous WAGS you can expect to see As the sun rises above the perfectly green pitches in leafy south west London, the glamorous WAGS of Wimbledon are preparing for two weeks of watching their sporty partners battle it out on the centre court. The world-famous tournament commenced on Monday, with the players and their girlfriends already sharing pictures and videos of SW19. The tennis wives and girlfriends - or TWAGS as they have become known - are known for their glitzy, jet-setting lifestyles and are often following their boyfriends, fiancés and husbands around the globe for prestigious tournaments. Some are even as famous as their partners in the tennis world themselves, and others have previously dated A-listers such as Jason Momoa and Timothée Chalamet. Tommy Paul's girlfriend Paige Lorenze has more than double the amount of followers as the athlete on Instagram and has launched her own business while also raking in extra cash through brand deals and collaborations. Meanwhile, Taylor Fritz and girlfriend Morgan Riddle are often dubbed the 'tennis Posh and Becks' with a modern twist - they met on a dating app. Eiza Gonzalez one of the latest TWAGs to join the exclusive group, after she confirmed her relationship to Grigor Dimitrov a couple of months ago, professing her love to him online. Paige has previously revealed that the European WAGS have their own WhatsApp group chat that they use to keep in contact with each other, with Louise Jacobi and Nina Ghaibi named as members. Morgan Riddle DATING TAYLOR FRITZ, 7th IN THE WORLD One of the most elegant and well-dressed WAGs in the stands is Morgan Riddle, who is dating Taylor Fritz. More than 400,000 people are interested in seeing her everyday life on Instagram, where she collaborates with brands (including 'Wimbledon Threads', an insta-series she launched last year in collaboration with the Grand Slam). She was also once dubbed 'the most famous woman in men's tennis' by the New York Times and seems to lead the WAGS through all major tournaments. Morgan recently posted a carousel of images of her enjoying Wimbeledon with the Instagram caption: 'We are sooo back.' She was seen sporting a tweedy baby pink belted dress with her cherry red Chanel quilted bag with a strawberry charm on it, paying credit to Wimbledon's famous fruits. She even tucked into some herself, as she sat and watched her boyfriend on the court. The American influencer is dating world no.13 Taylor Fritz after meeting on celebrity dating app Raya in 2020. Morgan, 27, uses her social media pages to document private jet flights, beach holidays, city shopping trips, and courtside seats as she travels around the world supporting her sports star beau. Her influencing career took off after she posted a TikTok asking her followers to help her choose an outfit for the Australian Open in 2022, gaining 1.5 million views. Another one gained seven million views with the caption: 'When you start dating a professional tennis player and literally all you do is travel the world, dress cute, drink champagne and go to Wimbledon.' Now, she and Fritz have become known as the 'Posh and Becks' of Tennis, and she says she spends around 40 weeks per year travelling as she follows him to major tournaments around the world. Morgan has even worked with Wimbledon itself in a 'Wimbledon threads' fashion insta-series in collaboration with the tournament. Morgan told The Age Australia: 'I think over those last two years I've transitioned from being Taylor Fritz's girlfriend to being Morgan Riddle.' She was born in Poland but grew up in Minnesota before moving to Los Angeles. She graduated from New York City's Wagner College with a Bachelor's Degree in English Language and Literature in 2019 and then went on to work as a social media director for a fashion brand. Fritz shares a son, seven, with his ex-wife Raquel Pedraza, who also played professional tennis. Paige Lorenze DATING TOMMY PAUL, 13th IN THE WORLD Paige is often seen front and centre in the boxes, watching Tommy Paul battle it out on the court in some of the world's most testing competitions, such as the US Open and Wimbledon. She joked that she was 'resuming my position as team chef,' a couple of days ago on Instagram as she posted pictures of her roasting tomatoes and cheese, seemingly cooking for Tommy and his comrades. Paige has already uploaded snaps showing off her chic Wimbledon ensembles from the famous green seated stands, as she joked that she was 'just here to supervise' her star athlete partner. But when she's not cheering on her boyfriend of three years, the glamorous  blonde business mogul is focusing on her social media presence and her multiple businesses. The businesswoman has spent years cultivating a following of almost one million people on Instagram, where she often shares behind the scenes pictures and videos of her appearances at matches, along with promoting her American lifestyle brand, Diary Boy and her home brand, American Charm. Paige, who was a successful athlete in her early years, splits her time between the Big Apple and a charming home in Connecticut when she isn't with her beau traveling the world on the ATP Tour. 'Tommy continues to support me, my business Dairy Boy, and my life in Connecticut and in turn, I'm able to show my support by traveling with him and being by his side at every tournament,' she told Page Six last year. Lorenze launched Dairy Boy, a fashion and lifestyle brand, off the back of her success as an influencer in 2021. The brand quickly became known for its high design baseball caps, camo crewnecks, and jeans, before expanding into sweats and other apparel items. She met Paul at the US Open in 2022 and throughout the first year of their relationship, she joined him at tournaments around the world and continued building her personal brand. 'I really poured my time into my business and I now have two horses, I live in a beautiful house, and I have an amazing boyfriend. I'm fulfilling all of my dreams,' she told Page Six last year, ahead of the couple's first anniversary. She even has a business profile in Forbes, as well as an agent, manager, assistant, stylist and publicist to help her keep on top of her glam life. In a chat with Interview magazine last year, Paige described Wimbledon as 'very posh' and opened up about her fashion choices at Tommy's matches. She said: 'I got to a point where I was sort of like, 'I'm here for Tommy.' I love fashion, but I want to be comfortable at his matches. And Tommy comes first - before fashion statements. 'He is the least needy boyfriend, first of all. He's so supportive of me. He wants me to be doing what makes me happy. And as much as he wants me at every tournament, he totally understands...."

Both children braved UGG boots for their oceanside outing.

mov_5F44ADECB935A969A501A6A992416630,2025-07-04 09:45:00,en,WEB,"  Five years ago, she knew nothing about tennis – today, she's become a star at her boyfriend's show More than two decades ago, the term 'WAG' exploded into pop-culture consciousness. An acronym for the 'wives and girlfriends' of high-profile athletes, what began as an entertaining sports-adjacent moment quickly become thought of as a negative term. The original WAGs – Victoria Beckham, Colleen Rooney and Cheryl Cole – were blamed for the England football team's 2006 World Cup failure. A Spanish newspaper branded them ""hooligans with Visas"". The same media outlets that branded them poor role models also only saw them through the prism of their partners. Today, the word is being redefined through the lens of Morgan Riddle, the 27-year-old girlfriend of the American tennis star Taylor Fritz, currently rated the world No 5. She might be there supporting Fritz at every game, but she's also the star of her own story – a woman credited with bringing tennis to a younger, female-led demographic. The New York Times called her “the most famous woman in men's tennis” and her TikTok and Instagram combined following totals over a million. If Wimbledon has become a less stuffy, more stylish game in the past few years, Riddle is the new poster girl for it. Her accessible social media presence and her show, Wimbledon Threads, which breaks down the best spectator looks, has become a gateway into tennis for a Gen Z and Gen Alpha audience. She sees shifting perceptions of WAGs as a goal. “I've always embraced the WAG thing,” she tells me on a Zoom call. “I knew no matter what my feelings were on it, that's what I'd be called – so I never wanted to attach anything negative to it. Instead, I wanted to shift people's perspective on the word.” She compares the public's response to it to the divisive perception of influencers. “People immediately think 'urgh' and part of that is rooted in misogyny,” she says. “Fashion content creation is a female-led environment, so people criticise it. The same thing has happened in the WAG world, despite the fact that most WAGs are educated, run their own businesses and have good jobs. On top of that, these women also have the full-time job of supporting their partner. I'm not sure people understand and respect that.” Riddle has a way of talking about big achievements and ambitions with such lightness of touch. She might sound as peppy as a cheerleader, but she's self-aware, laser-focused and knows her self-worth. “People think of a WAG as someone who follows their partner around without having their own life,” she says. “Maybe they're financially dependant on them. I came in swinging, really making my own name in this space, and am trying to actively contribute to the sport. I don't just take glam pictures of myself. I know for a fact that I have brought a younger demographic to the game, and a younger, female-led audience too. I've made it more welcoming for female fans. Having a purpose for everything I'm doing is very important to me.” Tennis wasn't something Riddle grew up with; in fact, she knew very little about it. She was raised in Minnesota to a family of dairy farmers where the cooler weather meant that hockey was the sport of choice. Riddle thought she'd marry a farmer and would lead a bucolic life in the Mid-West until she watched the hit show Ugly Betty. The New York-based series was a siren call for her to move to the city, so she decided to study English at Wagner College on Staten Island. When she graduated, she moved into influencer marketing for Love Your Melon, which sold hats to raise money for paediatric cancer, and latterly for Gamers Outreach Foundation, a not-for-profit that brings video games to children's hospitals. During the pandemic in 2020, she was scrolling through the exclusive dating app Raya when she connected with Taylor Fritz. “In one of his pictures he was holding a koala and I just thought it was a really cute photo,” she recalls, laughing. “I mean, when you're swiping on dating apps it's not that deep.” She had no idea that he was a big shot in tennis. “In another of his pictures, he was playing tennis but I just thought, 'Oh cute, he must have played it at college or something.'” She knew pretty fast that he had staying power after she suggested watching the horror film Midsommar as a first-date activity, and he didn't balk despite hating the genre. The pandemic meant that Fritz was on a break from his usually intense tennis schedule, so the two enjoyed a quiet six-month period where they saw each other most days. “There was an instant connection,” she says. When Fritz did explain what was required of him outside of global pandemics in terms of training and travelling commitments, Riddle jumped at the chance to see more of the world. Her job at that time was remote, so she was able to work from wherever he was. She stresses that she doesn't just wait for her boyfriend in hotel rooms; when she's not watching the games, she's browsing museums, markets and trying out new restaurants. “I didn't travel very much growing up. We would go on spring break to South Dakota, but nowhere far-flung,” she says. ""So the idea of getting to travel the world and explore all these amazing places that the tennis tour brings us to was just amazing. I was and still am so game for it.”..."

Un equipo docente que se mantiene prácticamente al completo respecto a la última edición, pero que deja la noticia del adiós de Abril Zamora y la incorporación de La Dani como nuevo docente de interpretación. La actriz y directora, que fue una de las revelaciones de OT 2023 por sus clases y consejos interpretativos a la última generación de concursantes, se cae del elenco de la nueva temporada. Según explican fuentes de Prime Video a verTele, esta baja se debe a compromisos profesionales de Abril Zamora que tenía previamente y que no son compatibles con el calendario de Operación Triunfo y la dedicación que este requiere. Su papel en el claustruo de la Academia lo asumirá un compañero de profesión como La Dani. Artista polifacético, ganador de un Premio Feroz y nominado al Goya, destacan de su figura que “aportará una mirada fresca al trabajo interpretativo de los concursantes”. Completan las nuevas incorporaciones Andrea Vilallonga, que vuelve al programa tras la etapa de TVE como profesora de imagen y comunicación para ayudar a los concursantes a desarrollar su presencia mediática y seguridad sobre el escenario; y Pol Cejas, profesor de entrenamiento y yoga, que fomentará el bienestar físico y mental de los concursantes.

只要能吃苦，就有吃不完的苦。 全球零售巨头沃尔玛对这句中文梗应该颇有同感。 它刚刚花10年时间解决一场“中年危机”，适应了电商时代，挡住了亚马逊的冲击，公司营收和净利在2024、2025财年都实现了不错的增长。 但就像中年人的世界里总有解不完的难题，进入2025年的沃尔玛，迎来了包括特朗普关税政策在内的一系列不确定因素，接下来的业绩，恐怕也很难保持过去两年的高增长。 受政策影响，这家以性价比著称的零售企业还在美国对部分商品进行了涨价——这可以看作是一场对自己的背刺。 在消费世界里，贵的可以更贵，比如CHANEL年年涨价年年有人追着买，甚至把它当成理财产品看升值空间，但蜜雪冰城把冰激凌和柠檬水卖贵一块钱，是要做好挨骂的心理建设的。 沃尔玛过去几年的业绩增长，其实也不是靠把便宜货卖给勤俭持家的人。 沃尔玛CFO约翰·瑞尼(John Rainey)表示，2025财年第三季度，沃尔玛约75%的增长来自年收入超过10万美元的家庭，咨询公司Morning Consult的调查也显示，年收入10万美元以上的家庭中在沃尔玛购物的比例，自2019年的77%上升至2024年的89%。 而十年前，调研机构Kantar Retail数据给出的沃尔玛顾客画像是：年收入多在5万美元以下，年龄主要为45岁以上——翻译过来就是：扣扣搜搜的中年人。 其实，全世界中产都具备着类似的消费习惯：既要性价比，又要体面。 他们的身影会出现在农村大集上，但这更多是体验烟火气的快乐，他们不会真的为了5块钱一兜的黄瓜坚持复购。 但叮咚买菜的8点打折夜市、好特卖4块钱一瓶的巴黎水，是能卖到他们心坎上的。 所以沃尔玛在这几年增加了不少高级的SKU，提升门店体验，比如使用让人更舒适的灯光色温，增强数字体验，拼命甩掉以前那个廉价、传统的老标签。 一个更重要的进展是，它终于搞定了电商业务——一个它从20多年前就开始涉足的板块。 老大哥的眼光还是很好的，但前期重视程度不够，也没什么章法，发展太慢。 好在它后面补课很努力，慢慢搭起电商基建。 疫情再给了关键性的催化：2020年，沃尔玛美国的电商业务实现了79%的销售增长，到2021年时，它已经成为美国电商行业的老二，仅次于亚马逊。 2025财年，沃尔玛在全球的电商销售额达到1210亿美元，且最近9个季度的增速不低于15%。 电商业务在公司总销售额中的占比达到了17.94%——10年前，这个数字只有2.53%。 图源：沃尔玛2025财年年报
从财务数据来看，沃尔玛就像是顺利进入新赛道的中年人，又过上了好日子：
沃尔玛大卖场的销售额，三年增长超900亿美元，从2022财年的4942.06亿美元达到2025财年的5843亿美元——定位类似的家乐福，在相似时间段的2021年和2024年，销售额分别为812.45亿欧元和945.5亿欧元，按照当下汇率，三年增长额不到160亿美元。 02
人类历史往往是由一些关键人物推动的，老公司们的进化也是如此。 在沃尔玛长达20多年的电商业务故事里，有两位关键人物：一位是在2010年组建起专门电商部门的CEO麦道克(Mike Duke)，相当于把电商部门变成了正规军；一位是他的后一任CEO董明伦（Doug McMillon）。 在2014年2月接任CEO时，董明伦表面风光，47岁的他，是除创始人山姆·沃尔顿外，沃尔玛历史上最年轻的CEO。 他对沃尔玛足够了解，从基层采购员干起，工作接近25年。 过往经历也证明他能打硬仗：他曾经在沃尔玛受金融危机影响而业绩下滑时，临危受命，出任国际业务总裁兼CEO，很快，国际业务成为2011~2013财年公司增长最快的部门。 但提振一块业务，跟带动一艘大船转向，根本上是两回事。 你能把西红柿鸡蛋做好吃，未必能撑起一桌体面的家宴。 2014年的沃尔玛就像是一艘需要打补丁的大船。 营收增速只有个位数，还在2014财年达到有史以来的最低值——1.6%。 净利润也在2012财年出现20年来首次下滑后，于2014财年再次下滑。 更糟糕的是，这艘大船好像有点迷失了方向。 当时美国的电商业务热火朝天。 2010年~2013年，美国电子商务零售销售规模由1654亿美元增长至2630亿美元，平均年增速达到16.6%，远超实体零售业同期6.2%的的平均年增速。 而沃尔玛的电商业务在2014财年刚突破100亿美元的销售额——这相当于隔壁亚马逊电子零售业务在2013年的增长额。 董明伦干了几件事情：
1、抄作业。 对标亚马逊，从动态价格体系到电子支付，再到发展无人机配送、与出租车公司合作提高即时配送能力，沃尔玛“抄”得很认真。 2、使出“钞能力”，通过收购的方式快速补齐短板。 从2014年-2018年，沃尔玛几乎在全球撒钱，花费超过200亿美元收购了超20家公司。 其中的大头，160亿美元用来买了一家印度电商公司Flipkart——它一度在印度做到了市场第一，还在人工智能方面积累不少。 收购带来的另一大资源是人才。 董明伦在2016年收购美国初创电商平台Jet后，直接安排创始人马克·劳尔（Marc Lore）担任沃尔玛电商部门主管。 也是从这开始，沃尔玛的电商生意挤进了快车道。 在中国市场，沃尔玛尝试过收购1号店来发展电商，最终变成与京东合作，利用后者的配送服务解决物流问题。 这个模式后来被复制到日本，合作对象是当地最大的电商平台乐天。 3、调整店型，抓“小”放“大”。 传统的沃尔玛门店在电商业务中有了“前置仓”的角色，相比大而全，快捷更重要。 于是，沃尔玛放缓了传统门店的扩张速度，对既有门店进行升级改造，做小店。 2015、2016财年，沃尔玛在美国开了260家社区店和中小型门店，而大卖场只开了177家。 这些动作的共同特点就是：费钱、无法立竿见影出成绩、拖累财报数据。 资本市场显然是有怀疑的，2016年下半年，连长期持有沃尔玛股票的巴菲特，也因沃尔玛与亚马逊之间的增速差距过大，选择大幅抛售。..."

只要能吃苦，就有吃不完的苦。 全球零售巨头沃尔玛对这句中文梗应该颇有同感。 它刚刚花10年时间解决一场“中年危机”，适应了电商时代，挡住了亚马逊的冲击，公司营收和净利在2024、2025财年都实现了不错的增长。 但就像中年人的世界里总有解不完的难题，进入2025年的沃尔玛，迎来了包括特朗普关税政策在内的一系列不确定因素，接下来的业绩，恐怕也很难保持过去两年的高增长。 受政策影响，这家以性价比著称的零售企业还在美国对部分商品进行了涨价——这可以看作是一场对自己的背刺。 在消费世界里，贵的可以更贵，比如CHANEL年年涨价年年有人追着买，甚至把它当成理财产品看升值空间，但蜜雪冰城把冰激凌和柠檬水卖贵一块钱，是要做好挨骂的心理建设的。 沃尔玛过去几年的业绩增长，其实也不是靠把便宜货卖给勤俭持家的人。 沃尔玛CFO约翰·瑞尼(John Rainey)表示，2025财年第三季度，沃尔玛约75%的增长来自年收入超过10万美元的家庭，咨询公司Morning Consult的调查也显示，年收入10万美元以上的家庭中在沃尔玛购物的比例，自2019年的77%上升至2024年的89%。 而十年前，调研机构Kantar Retail数据给出的沃尔玛顾客画像是：年收入多在5万美元以下，年龄主要为45岁以上——翻译过来就是：扣扣搜搜的中年人。 其实，全世界中产都具备着类似的消费习惯：既要性价比，又要体面。 他们的身影会出现在农村大集上，但这更多是体验烟火气的快乐，他们不会真的为了5块钱一兜的黄瓜坚持复购。 但叮咚买菜的8点打折夜市、好特卖4块钱一瓶的巴黎水，是能卖到他们心坎上的。 所以沃尔玛在这几年增加了不少高级的SKU，提升门店体验，比如使用让人更舒适的灯光色温，增强数字体验，拼命甩掉以前那个廉价、传统的老标签。 一个更重要的进展是，它终于搞定了电商业务——一个它从20多年前就开始涉足的板块。 老大哥的眼光还是很好的，但前期重视程度不够，也没什么章法，发展太慢。 好在它后面补课很努力，慢慢搭起电商基建。 疫情再给了关键性的催化：2020年，沃尔玛美国的电商业务实现了79%的销售增长，到2021年时，它已经成为美国电商行业的老二，仅次于亚马逊。 2025财年，沃尔玛在全球的电商销售额达到1210亿美元，且最近9个季度的增速不低于15%。 电商业务在公司总销售额中的占比达到了17.94%——10年前，这个数字只有2.53%。 图源：沃尔玛2025财年年报 
从财务数据来看，沃尔玛就像是顺利进入新赛道的中年人，又过上了好日子： 
沃尔玛大卖场的销售额，三年增长超900亿美元，从2022财年的4942.06亿美元达到2025财年的5843亿美元——定位类似的家乐福，在相似时间段的2021年和2024年，销售额分别为812.45亿欧元和945.5亿欧元，按照当下汇率，三年增长额不到160亿美元。 02 
人类历史往往是由一些关键人物推动的，老公司们的进化也是如此。 在沃尔玛长达20多年的电商业务故事里，有两位关键人物：一位是在2010年组建起专门电商部门的CEO麦道克(Mike Duke)，相当于把电商部门变成了正规军；一位是他的后一任CEO董明伦（Doug McMillon）。 在2014年2月接任CEO时，董明伦表面风光，47岁的他，是除创始人山姆·沃尔顿外，沃尔玛历史上最年轻的CEO。 他对沃尔玛足够了解，从基层采购员干起，工作接近25年。 过往经历也证明他能打硬仗：他曾经在沃尔玛受金融危机影响而业绩下滑时，临危受命，出任国际业务总裁兼CEO，很快，国际业务成为2011~2013财年公司增长最快的部门。 但提振一块业务，跟带动一艘大船转向，根本上是两回事。 你能把西红柿鸡蛋做好吃，未必能撑起一桌体面的家宴。 2014年的沃尔玛就像是一艘需要打补丁的大船。 营收增速只有个位数，还在2014财年达到有史以来的最低值——1.6%。 净利润也在2012财年出现20年来首次下滑后，于2014财年再次下滑。 更糟糕的是，这艘大船好像有点迷失了方向。 当时美国的电商业务热火朝天。 2010年~2013年，美国电子商务零售销售规模由1654亿美元增长至2630亿美元，平均年增速达到16.6%，远超实体零售业同期6.2%的平均年增速。 而沃尔玛的电商业务在2014财年刚突破100亿美元的销售额——这相当于隔壁亚马逊电子零售业务在2013年的增长额。 董明伦干了几件事情： 
1、抄作业。 对标亚马逊，从动态价格体系到电子支付，再到发展无人机配送、与出租车公司合作提高即时配送能力，沃尔玛“抄”得很认真。 2、使出“钞能力”，通过收购的方式快速补齐短板。 从2014年-2018年，沃尔玛几乎在全球撒钱，花费超过200亿美元收购了超20家公司。 其中的大头，160亿美元用来买了一家印度电商公司Flipkart——它一度在印度做到了市场第一，还在

沃尔玛大卖场的销售额，三年增长超900亿美元，从2022财年的4942.06亿美元达到2025财年的5843亿美元——定位类似的家乐福，在相似时间段的2021年和2024年，销售额分别为812.45亿欧元和945.5亿欧元，按照当下汇率，三年增长额不到160亿美元。 02
人类历史往往是由一些关键人物推动的，老公司们的进化也是如此。 在沃尔玛长达20多年的电商业务故事里，有两位关键人物：一位是在2010年组建起专门电商部门的CEO麦道克(Mike Duke)，相当于把电商部门变成了正规军；一位是他的后一任CEO董明伦（Doug McMillon）。 在2014年2月接任CEO时，董明伦表面风光，47岁的他，是除创始人山姆·沃尔顿外，沃尔玛历史上最年轻的CEO。 他对沃尔玛足够了解，从基层采购员干起，工作接近25年。 过往经历也证明他能打硬仗：他曾经在沃尔玛受金融危机影响而业绩下滑时，临危受命，出任国际业务总裁兼CEO，很快，国际业务成为2011~2013财年公司增长最快的部门。 但提振一块业务，跟带动一艘大船转向，根本上是两回事。 你能把西红柿鸡蛋做好吃，未必能撑起一桌体面的家宴。 2014年的沃尔玛就像是一艘需要打补丁的大船。 营收增速只有个位数，还在2014财年达到有史以来的最低值——1.6%。 净利润也在2012财年出现20年来首次下滑后，于2014财年再次下滑。 更糟糕的是，这艘大船好像有点迷失了方向。 当时美国的电商业务热火朝天。 2010年~2013年，美国电子商务零售销售规模由1654亿美元增长至2630亿美元，平均年增速达到16.6%，远超实体零售业同期6.2%的的平均年增速。 而沃尔玛的电商业务在2014财年刚突破100亿美元的销售额——这相当于隔壁亚马逊电子零售业务在2013年的增长额。 董明伦干了几件事情：
1、抄作业。 对标亚马逊，从动态价格体系到电子支付，再到发展无人机配送、与出租车公司合作提高即时配送能力，沃尔玛“抄”得很认真。 2、使出“钞能力”，通过收购的方式快速补齐短板。 从2014年-2018年，沃尔玛几乎在全球撒钱，花费超过200亿美元收购了超20家公司。 其中的大头，160亿美元用来买了一家印度电商公司Flipkart——它一度在印度做到了市场第一，还在人工智能方面积累不少。 收购带来的另一大资源是人才。 董明伦在2016年收购美国初创电商平台Jet后，直接安排创始人马克·劳尔（Marc Lore）担任沃尔玛电商部门主管。 也是从这开始，沃尔玛的电商生意挤进了快车道。 在中国市场，沃尔玛尝试过收购1号店来发展电商，最终变成与京东合作，利用后者的配送服务解决物流问题。 这个模式后来被复制到日本，合作对象是当地最大的电商平台乐天。 3、调整店型，抓“小”放“大”。 传统的沃尔玛门店在电商业务中有了“前置仓”的角色，相比大而全，快捷更重要。 于是，沃尔玛放缓了传统门店的扩张速度，对既有门店进行升级改造，做小店。 2015、2016财年，沃尔玛在美国开了260家社区店和中小型门店，而大卖场只开了177家。 这些动作的共同特点就是：费钱、无法立竿见影出成绩、拖累财报数据。..."
mov_3679B450801B2693AD7E81A6881471EC,2025-07-04 11:54:47,en,WEB,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Kelly Osbourne showcased her slender frame in black knitted dress as she attended the Diamonds and Dust gala night with her partner Sid Wilson on Thursday. The TV personality, 40, who is the daughter of rock legend Ozzy and TV star Sharon Osbourne, looked incredible as she attended the event at London's Emerald Theatre. She wowed in the off-shoulder garment that she paired with strappy black platform heels, a crossbody black leather Chanel bag and silver earrings. Kelly completed her look by styling her ice blonde locks into a towering beehive with a sweeping side fringe that further accentuated her tiny frame. As she left Dita Von Teese's new show, Kelly was seen holding hands with Slipknot DJ Sid who wore a black and white oversized shirt, black trousers and New Balance trainers. Kelly has been open about her 85lb postpartum weight loss after welcoming her son, Sidney, two, with Sid and has denied having used Ozempic to help her shed the weight. She revealed she 'rapidly' lost the weight by cutting out 'sugar and carbohydrates' and not by using Hollywood's favorite weight-loss drug. Kelly's outing comes after she shared a snap of herself earlier this year looking dramatically different, reigniting speculation that she's had plastic surgery. The star took to Instagram to post a couple of glamorous shots after getting her hair and makeup done, with her face looking smoother and more chiselled than ever. Captioning the photos, Kelly revealed she'd been all glammed up for her plans to be cancelled at the last minute, lamenting: 'Sat through glam only to find that my day had been cancelled. #alldressedupandnowheretogo'. However, her followers were distracted by her noticeably slimmer and tauter appearance, which highlighted her sharper jawline, voluptuous lips, and lifted brows. They raced to the comments to admit they could barely recognise the star and accused her of getting heavy cosmetic work done that had made her look as though she'd had a 'full head transplant'. They commented: 'Is Kelly Osborne in the room with us?' ; 'WHO IS THAT?? Wft....'; 'Gifted a new head for Christmas….' ; 'totally different head'. 'Who's face is that?' ; 'Full head transplant'; 'Lots of money and a good plastic surgeon and we can all be this beautiful'. 'Wow amazing what tons of plastic surgery, ozempic and money can do'; 'Is this the same Kelly Osbourne or. .' ; 'New face, who dis?' 'Where is Kelly?' ; 'can't imagine how many surgeries, fillers, botox injections, skin treatments, etc. were involved in this transformation. When you no longer look anything like yourself, what exactly did you accomplish?' 'Teenage Kelly would not be happy about this'; 'What in the millions dollars worth of plastic surgery is this'; 'Is she AI?!' Kelly has undergone many changes in her appearance over the years. In 2020, she revealed that she had quietly undergone gastric sleeve surgery two years before, leading to a jaw-dropping 85lb weight loss. She also previously admitted to having injections to change the shape of her face, and make her jaw look 'skinnier,' after suffering with TMJ (temporomandibular joint dysfunction). However, Kelly has repeatedly and furiously denied that she has had any cosmetic procedures besides Botox. Last year, she declared that she was a 'huge fan' of plastic surgery, but insisted that she was too scared to get anything done after seeing her mother go under the knife so many times. She told People: 'I am a huge fan of plastic surgery. What it does for people is amazing. It can change people's lives and give them the confidence they've been lacking, and make people feel beautiful in the way they want to feel beautiful. 'But I've never done anything but Botox. I'm too scared. I've always been in the camp of if you think it's broken, fix it. You don't have to be stuck with a nose you hate for the rest of your life. So yes, I'm a huge fan.' She explained the root of her fear, saying: 'I watched my mum go through every recovery from everything she's ever had done, and it looks awful'. Sharon, 72, has undergone a range of procedures including a gastric band, full facelift, tummy tuck, an eyelift, breast implants, abdominoplasty and Botox. While she has branded her 2021 facelift the 'worst thing she ever did' after the procedure left her 'looking like a cyclops' and 'Quasimodo'. Back in March last year, Sharon shocked the public after she made her return to UK reality TV on Celebrity Big Brother. The star couldn't hide her weight loss on the show as she revealed doctors 'can't figure out' why she hasn't been able to gain weight back after she stopped using Ozempic months ago. 'The doctors can't figure it out,' she said. ' But I think it's just because I'm getting older and as you get older you lose weight anyway and shrink and shrivel off.' On why she decided to start receiving Ozempic injections, Sharon said 'everyone was doing it'."
mov_0138FE84A7380E04C91BA34F35A84010,2025-07-04 12:00:00,en,WEB,"  The former Spice Girl's wedding dress had to be flown across the Atlantic four times to be perfectly fitted NEED TO KNOW Victoria Beckham and David Beckham got married 26 years ago on July 4, 1999 The fashion designer wore a champagne dress made by Vera Wang before changing into matching purple ensembles with David The dress featured a 20-foot train and a sculpted neckline Victoria Beckham is an undisputed style icon, and her 1999 wedding gown just might be one of her most memorable looks. On July 4, 1999, Victoria married soccer star David Beckham at the Luttrellstown Castle near Dublin. While David wore a chic white suit, Victoria opted for a stunning champagne ball gown made by iconic bridal designer Vera Wang. The silk pleated dress featured a 20-foot train and a sculpted, strapless neckline. To top off the look, Victoria accessorized the ensemble with an 18-karat gold tiara by jewelry designer Slim Barrett. Although the couple later ditched their white ceremony outfits in favor of matching purple getups for their reception, Victoria's wedding dress remains one of the most iconic staples from their lavish wedding and in her fashion lookbook as a whole. From details on the tiara to how that cinched bodice was made, here's everything to know about Victoria Beckham's wedding dress. The corset was made by Mister Pearl David Beckham and Victoria Beckham on their wedding day. David Beckham/Instagram One of couture's most celebrated corsetieres, Mister Pearl designed the underbodice for Victoria's wedding dress, which helped augment the structural top half of her ensemble. “The actual underbodice was made by a very famous couture corsetiere named Mister Pearl, who works only out of London,” Wang told PEOPLE in 2023. “He makes corsets that have to be pulled [in] with these metal things, which is how corsets were done in the old days.” Mister Pearl has worked with a slew of designers throughout his career, including Thierry Mugler and Vivienne Westwood. He also famously created Kim Kardashian's cinched corset for her iconic 2019 Met Gala look. The fashion entrepreneur joked in a red carpet interview with Vogue that she wasn't sure if she could take a “deep breath” while wearing the staple piece. “It takes about 45 minutes to lace up,” Wang added of Mister Pearl's unique corsets. “And it can take your waist down to literally 18 inches [like] Scarlett O'Hara.” The gown flew across the Atlantic four times David and Victoria Beckham during their wedding in 1999. Victoria Beckham/ Instagram Since Mister Pearl exclusively works out of England, Victoria's dress — specifically its sculpted bodice — had to fly back and forth between New York City and London. “I call it the transatlantic dress,” Wang told PEOPLE, adding that the bodice had to fly four times across the pond. Wang flew out to London to help fit the corset onto Victoria, and the former Spice Girl also had to visit New York twice for more fittings. Things took a pause, however, when Victoria became pregnant with her and David's firstborn, Brooklyn. “So then we delayed the wedding for two years,” Wang said. “Then we resumed, or maybe a year and a half. So that is [what] I call the transatlantic wedding with Victoria and David.” The designer also fondly remembered a baby Brooklyn “crawling around on the bed in London” during the fittings. Her tiara was decorated with brilliant-cut diamonds David Beckham and Victoria Adams Beckham hug on their wedding day. David Backham/ Instagram Victoria topped off her bridal ensemble with an iconic staple piece — an 18-karat gold tiara. To create the gorgeous headpiece, the Spice World star tapped jewelry designer Slim Barrett, who has collaborated with fashion houses like Chanel and Versace throughout his career and designed pieces for Mick Jagger and Princess Diana. The tiara, named the “East of Paris,” was made from 18-carat latticed gold and adorned with brilliant-cut diamonds and suspended diamond drops. After the wedding, Barrett kept the crown, and it was later displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London for its 100 Tiaras, Past and Present show. Barrett eventually put up the tiara for auction in 2013 at Bonhams in London, where it was valued between 18,000 and 25,000 pounds. “Inspiration for East of Paris came from my love of Eastern design and Parisian haute couture,” Barrett told British Vogue at the time. “I set out to fuse the two styles.” Victoria still has her wedding dress David Beckham and Victoria Adams Beckham on their wedding day. David Beckham/ Instagram Years after their wedding, Victoria has held onto her gown. In a 2018 video for British Vogue, the fashion designer whipped out the wedding dress to honor her brand's 10th anniversary and to celebrate her life in looks. “Today we're here at Vogue and we are shooting a cover story celebrating the rich and inspiring history of one of the most enduring style icons of all time … me, Victoria Beckham,” she joked at the start of the video...."

Un equipo docente que se mantiene prácticamente al completo respecto a la última edición, pero que deja la noticia del adiós de Abril Zamora y la incorporación de La Dani como nuevo docente de interpretación. La actriz y directora, que fue una de las revelaciones de OT 2023 por sus clases y consejos interpretativos a la última generación de concursantes, se cae del elenco de la nueva temporada. Según explican fuentes de Prime Video a verTele, esta baja se debe a compromisos profesionales de Abril Zamora que tenía previamente y que no son compatibles con el calendario de Operación Triunfo y la dedicación que este requiere. Su papel en el claustruo de la Academia lo asumirá un compañero de profesión como La Dani. Artista polifacético, ganador de un Premio Feroz y nominado al Goya, destacan de su figura que “aportará una mirada fresca al trabajo interpretativo de los concursantes”.

只要能吃苦，就有吃不完的苦。 全球零售巨头沃尔玛对这句中文梗应该颇有同感。 它刚刚花10年时间解决一场“中年危机”，适应了电商时代，挡住了亚马逊的冲击，公司营收和净利在2024、2025财年都实现了不错的增长。 但就像中年人的世界里总有解不完的难题，进入2025年的沃尔玛，迎来了包括特朗普关税政策在内的一系列不确定因素，接下来的业绩，恐怕也很难保持过去两年的高增长。 受政策影响，这家以性价比著称的零售企业还在美国对部分商品进行了涨价——这可以看作是一场对自己的背刺。 在消费世界里，贵的可以更贵，比如CHANEL年年涨价年年有人追着买，甚至把它当成理财产品看升值空间，但蜜雪冰城把冰激凌和柠檬水卖贵一块钱，是要做好挨骂的心理建设的。 沃尔玛过去几年的业绩增长，其实也不是靠把便宜货卖给勤俭持家的人。 沃尔玛CFO约翰·瑞尼(John Rainey)表示，2025财年第三季度，沃尔玛约75%的增长来自年收入超过10万美元的家庭，咨询公司Morning Consult的调查也显示，年收入10万美元以上的家庭中在沃尔玛购物的比例，自2019年的77%上升至2024年的89%。 而十年前，调研机构Kantar Retail数据给出的沃尔玛顾客画像是：年收入多在5万美元以下，年龄主要为45岁以上——翻译过来就是：扣扣搜搜的中年人。 其实，全世界中产都具备着类似的消费习惯：既要性价比，又要体面。 他们的身影会出现在农村大集上，但这更多是体验烟火气的快乐，他们不会真的为了5块钱一兜的黄瓜坚持复购。 但叮咚买菜的8点打折夜市、好特卖4块钱一瓶的巴黎水，是能卖到他们心坎上的。 所以沃尔玛在这几年增加了不少高级的SKU，提升门店体验，比如使用让人更舒适的灯光色温，增强数字体验，拼命甩掉以前那个廉价、传统的老标签。 一个更重要的进展是，它终于搞定了电商业务——一个它从20多年前就开始涉足的板块。 老大哥的眼光还是很好的，但前期重视程度不够，也没什么章法，发展太慢。 好在它后面补课很努力，慢慢搭起电商基建。 疫情再给了关键性的催化：2020年，沃尔玛美国的电商业务实现了79%的销售增长，到2021年时，它已经成为美国电商行业的老二，仅次于亚马逊。 2025财年，沃尔玛在全球的电商销售额达到1210亿美元，且最近9个季度的增速不低于15%。 电商业务在公司总销售额中的占比达到了17.94%——10年前，这个数字只有2.53%。 图源：沃尔玛2025财年年报 
从财务数据来看，沃尔玛就像是顺利进入新赛道的中年人，又过上了好日子： 
沃尔玛大卖场的销售额，三年增长超900亿美元，从2022财年的4942.06亿美元达到2025财年的5843亿美元——定位类似的家乐福，在相似时间段的2021年和2024年，销售额分别为812.45亿欧元和945.5亿欧元，按照当下汇率，三年增长额不到160亿美元。 02 
人类历史往往是由一些关键人物推动的，老公司们的进化也是如此。 在沃尔玛长达20多年的电商业务故事里，有两位关键人物：一位是在2010年组建起专门电商部门的CEO麦道克(Mike Duke)，相当于把电商部门变成了正规军；一位是他的后一任CEO董明伦（Doug McMillon）。 在2014年2月接任CEO时，董明伦表面风光，47岁的他，是除创始人山姆·沃尔顿外，沃尔玛历史上最年轻的CEO。 他对沃尔玛足够了解，从基层采购员干起，工作接近25年。 过往经历也证明他能打硬仗：他曾经在沃尔玛受金融危机影响而业绩下滑时，临危受命，出任国际业务总裁兼CEO，很快，国际业务成为2011~2013财年公司增长最快的部门。 但提振一块业务，跟带动一艘大船转向，根本上是两回事。 你能把西红柿鸡蛋做好吃，未必能撑起一桌体面的家宴。 2014年的沃尔玛就像是一艘需要打补丁的大船。 营收增速只有个位数，还在2014财年达到有史以来的最低值——1.6%。 净利润也在2012财年出现20年来首次下滑后，于2014财年再次下滑。 更糟糕的是，这艘大船好像有点迷失了方向。 当时美国的电商业务热火朝天。 2010年~2013年，美国电子商务零售销售规模由1654亿美元增长至2630亿美元，平均年增速达到16.6%，远超实体零售业同期6.2%的平均年增速。 而沃尔玛的电商业务在2014财年刚突破100亿美元的销售额——这相当于隔壁亚马逊电子零售业务在2013年的增长额。 董明伦干了几件事情： 
1、抄作业。 对标亚马逊，从动态价格体系到电子支付，再到发展无人机配送、与出租车公司合作提高即时配送能力，沃尔玛“抄”得很认真。 2、使出“钞能力”，通过收购的方式快速补齐短板。 从2014年-2018年，沃尔玛几乎在全球撒钱，花费超过200亿美元收购了超20家公司。 其中的大头，160亿美元用来买了一家印度电商公司Flipkart——它一度在印度做到了市场第一，还在人工智能方面积累不少。 收购带来的另一大资源是人才。 董明伦在2016年收购美国初创电商平台Jet后，直接安排创始人马克·劳尔（Marc Lore）担任沃尔玛电商部门主管。 也是从这开始，沃尔玛的电商生意挤进了快车道。 在中国市场，沃尔玛尝试过收购1号店来发展电商，最终变成与京东合作，利用后者的配送服务解决物流问题。 这个模式后来被复制到日本，合作对象是当地最大的电商平台乐天。 3、调整店型，抓“小”放“大”。 传统的沃尔玛门店在电商业务中有了“前置仓”的角色，相比大而全，快捷更重要。 于是，沃尔玛放缓了传统门店的扩张速度，对既有门店进行升级改造，做小店。 2015、2016财年，沃尔玛在美国开了260家社区店和中小型门店，而大卖场只开了177家。 这些动作的共同特点就是：费钱、无法立竿见影出成绩、拖累财报数据。 资本市场显然是有怀疑的，2016年下半年，连长期持有沃尔玛股票的巴菲特，也因沃尔玛与亚马逊之间的增速差距过大，选择大幅抛售。..."

Back in the day, several things helped to shape pop culture. This included news outlets, celebrity gossip, and magazines. However, the world has changed. In this era, social media is the solitary driver of pop culture. Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and X are agents that spell out how pop culture is manufactured, shared, and consumed. They're not just tools for instant and efficient communication, though. These social media platforms double as instruments for setting trends and influencing behavioural patterns worldwide. Get a deep analysis of how social media influences pop culture in today's world in this article. Source: UGC Influencers Have Become the New Celebrities Actors and musicians were celebrities some decades ago. That's not the case in today's world. As long as you've got a smartphone with an internet connection, you can create a strong personal brand that attracts millions of individuals worldwide. You've seen it. Several TikTok stars, Twitch streamers, and YouTube content creators are making a name for themselves not just in their country but in a slew of jurisdictions around the globe. Their content influences fashion, dieting, and fitness goals. They also prompt the start of social challenges and promote music and movies. With social media, influencers can connect with their audience directly. As such, they can build personal relationships with their fans. This is something most traditional celebrities can only dream of. Viral Trends and Memes Social media is all about virality. Memes and challenges can spread across the world in several minutes or hours. Here are some challenges and trends that gained traction online and quickly became a fleeting phenomenon worldwide: Dance challenges such as Say So, Renegade, Out West, Stay, Super Lonely, Attention, Vibe, and Fancy Lite. Viral challenges such as the Ice Bucket Challenge, Don't Rush Challenge, Running Man Challenge, Savage Challenge, Renegade Challenge, One Chip Challenge, Trick Shot Challenge, and Cinnamon Challenge. Memes such as The Woman Yelling at a Cat, Rick Roll, Kamala Coconut, The Military Man, Mama Luigi, Trollface, Doge, and Pepe the Frog. If something that is relatable and tells a story is posted on social media, the chances of it taking off are high. The Discovery and Popularity of Music Social media has turned the music industry on its head. You can use YouTube and TikTok to discover new artists and music. For context, a song's catchy snippet being included in a comedy skit or dance challenge can bring new artists to the limelight and boost their streams. Lil Nas X is an example of a relatively unknown artist who changed the music marketing game to gain global reverence. He started as an independent artist, posting his SoundCloud music links on X. However, it wasn't long before he was noticed and became a famous musician with two Grammy Awards under his belt. Before record labels sign artists, they look at social media charts to see if they're trending or not. Artists, on the other hand, understand this. As such, they push out their releases with trendy hashtags with the hopes of getting noticed. Social Media's Role in Pop Culture Evolution Over Time Source: UGC Virtual Gaming Social media has also affected the virtual gaming sector. Gamers are now using platforms like Twitch and Discord to connect with others, share information, and create content on their favourite games. Before a game is released to the public, it's promoted through memes and entertaining video trailers. Additionally, developers also use social media to analyse demo playtime per region on their games to see what aspects appeal to players the most. These results are also used to create future gaming content that resonates with even more players. Aesthetics and Fashion Social media's impact is also felt in the fashion industry. The visual focus content posted on Instagram and TikTok has influenced how people dress and style others...."

mov_CDB5731B07967B111EED74CA9B4614BD,2025-07-04 15:00:00,en,WEB,"  The live-action adaptation of ""How to Train Your Dragon"" has impressed audiences with its realistic graphics and heartfelt story. The movie takes place in ancient times and tells the tale of a young boy, Hiccup, who becomes friends with a lovable dragon named Toothless. But Hiccup isn't the only character that audiences can't get enough of. It's his love interest Astrid that has people turning heads. And that could be because she is the daughter of a famous actor. Astrid is played by Nico Parker. Her feature-film debut was back in 2019 when she starred in the live-action adaptation of Disney's ""Dumbo."" The actor is the daughter of ""Westworld"" star Thandie Newton. The resemblance is obvious as both mother and daughter have glowing skin and piercing eyes. Unlike her mom, Parker often wears her hair naturally to show off her voluminous tight curls. But when it comes to fashion, the young starlet has clearly inherited her parent's famous style. In 2024, Parker told Harper's Bazaar how she used to envy her mother's couture style. ""Any Chanel bag that my mom owned was the most important thing in the house,"" she remembered. ""I did a lot of stealing those! And I would do fashion shows in her room with her bags and her shoes — a lot of which was Chanel."" And as she grows into a young woman, it's clear that Parker's love of high fashion is as present as ever! Nico Parker is rocking her own style on red carpets Sean Zanni/Getty & Tinseltown/Shutterstock Nico Parker is the latest celebrity kid that has the potential to be a fashion icon. She is not timid with her style, and wears highly glamorous outfits effortlessly. Sadly, Parker was subject to criticism for playing Astrid in ""How to Train Your Dragon."" She wore her natural curly hair for the role, which differed from the character's look of blond hair and blue eyes in the 2010 animated film. But Parker remained comfortable and confident in her appearance by not paying attention to her critics. She told The Times of London, ""If I wouldn't value your opinion on most things in life, I can't value your opinion on my hair."" Parker often opts for dark eyeliner and black ensembles, but she also likes to show off her feminine side. For the red-carpet premiere of ""How to Train Your Dragon,"" Parker wore a lovely light-pink dress with bows down the bodice. The sleeveless dress had a layered skirt of textured materials like frills and ruffles. This harkens back to Parker's first red-carpet premiere in 2019 for the movie ""Dumbo."" She was just 14 at the time, and wore a dark-green velvet minidress that had an intriguing cape. The outfit proved that capes aren't just for the runway and can be styled for the everyday. Across her waist, Parker looked youthful and cute as she wore a big pink bow as an accessory. We love that she's still including graceful bows in her wardrobe. Advertisement"

It's actually versatile and so beautiful, i can't imagine living without it. Fun story - my brother just got married, and I was there when his wife was getting her makeup done. Her base was SOSOSO pretty, like a real life filter. I asked the makeup artist wtf she did to make her skin so pretty? She said she just used the Flawless Filter all over, a concealer, and three different powders (Chanel, YSL, and the OG Givenchy) to mattify the majority of the face. I can't express how pretty that looked. Also my holy grail foundation till the end of times is the Armani Luminous Silk. Idk what this sorcery is but it's just so beautiful, no matter what other hyped/dupes/luxury foundations I try, I ALWAYS go back to it because it's on another level to me."
mov_95651F30C3BA85382716950A3EA8933D,2025-07-04 16:59:20,en,WEB,"  Gracie Abrams is having a summer for the books. The 25-year-old singer-songwriter has spent the better part of 2025 on her Secret Of Us Tour which began last September, did her Glastonbury debut last weekend and today sees her opening for Noah Kahan at BST Hyde Park. “Playing at Glastonbury on a Friday was such a privilege. It allowed me the time to lean in hard into the festival, which I did. That was intense and perfect for me in a great way, but it's a rarity,” she tells Bazaar on a sunny evening at the Broadwick, Soho. Abrams, whose first album, Minor, released in 2020, notes that her post-show rituals are often a lot more “vanilla”. “It's a quick shower and I'll get in the biggest clothes I have. I'll journal for a little bit or read something before I fall asleep,” she reflects. In between performing in ethereal ensembles by Chanel and Rodarte (barefoot, of course), for loyal fans who get teary-eyed by her melancho-pop sounds and vulnerable songwriting, Abrams has signed on to front Hourglass Cosmetics' new complexion campaign. Abrams' clean and polished signature make-up look ties in beautifully with Hourglass' range of your-skin-but-better concealers, bases and the new Illusion Priming Moisturiser. Ahead of her special appearance in Soho's The Vinyl Factory, Abrams sat down with Bazaar to share the heartfelt story behind her bob haircut, the signature scent that reminds her of home and her go-to blush combination. On her beauty philosophy… “I tend to feel the most beautiful when I have the least on my face and when I feel the most like myself. It's really just about what makes you feel like you. [With beauty] when you find the lane that makes sense for you, it's exciting and inspiring to explore it. My mum wasn't someone who wore a lot of make-up but when she did a red lip, or something extra, it always caught my attention. I also love Alexa Chung.” On her skincare routine… “In the morning, I use cold water, sometimes ice cubes, because I get really puffy. I'll use a simple moisturiser which I got while we were on tour in Korea and then I use the La-Roche Posay SPF. At night, I use a benzoyl peroxide between those steps, without the SPF.” On doing her own tour make-up… “I like the time to myself in that way. I slot for 20 more minutes than I actually need, just because it's nice to have an hour of the day sitting alone in a room. I value that alone time very much, and I do think it's therapeutic. I'll listen to a podcast, I like On Being with Krista Tippett. The guests that she has on are always so beautifully spoken and experts in their respective fields, and she's an excellent moderator. [For my make-up] on stage it's really about emphasising certain features, because I'm so far away from so many people. Off-stage, I use a concealer for spot treating, a blush and do my brows. I like fine highlighting powders that both set and give your face some sheen. I'm not a lipstick person so I use a brown-ish lip liner and a glossy balm. For stage, I go a bit heavier with highlighter and blush. I fill my brows in more.” On her favourite blushes… “I'm obsessed with Hourglass Unreal Liquid Blush in Vision and Scene, and the Diffused Heat powder blush. I initially wouldn't have leant into pinks like that, but it's so nice on the skin and it's really sheer.” On her signature scent… “Another 13 from Le Labo always makes me feel like I'm at home. Smells are so important when you're away from home to make you feel like you're back there. But when we were in Seoul, Le Labo does the city specific scent and that one is a new favourite as well.” On her bob haircut… “I honestly feel the most like myself with shorter hair. It was off the back of, almost like a pre-break-up, when things inside start to feel a bit tangled up, and you feel like you need a change. I didn't know where to start so I cut it all off and felt so much lighter. People say hair holds memories and feelings. It felt good to sever ties where I needed to, which sounds harsh but it really was a lighter and nicer experience than that. I love it. I see pictures of myself with my long hair or I'll watch somebody else's show and they're using their hair like this extra limb, and I'll get jealous. I'll miss it sometimes, but I think overall, I feel way more like myself and in my skin with this hair. Bobby Eliot cuts it.”..."

Already over 60 nations have decided on total boycott of Israel and the number is growing. What can you do as an individual member of the public do to help stop the genocide in Gaza AIPAC's sole agenda to wipe out Palestine and Iran. Also note that some products of Johnson's, Maggie, Nestle have been linked with serious side effects such as cancer. It may also help if you also boycotted nations that support Israel. Such as US, UK, German products, services and companies too. Cars such as Mercedes Benz, BMW, Audi, Porsche, Ford, Rolls Royce, Buick, Cadillac, Chevrolet, Mondeo, Mustang, EcoSport. With this the being tip of the iceberg of buying and controlling power. McDonalds and Burger King are also responsible for vast tracts of the Amazon rainforest being decimated beef production and converted into desert. Last year the Amazon experienced its first drought on record. Even the US govt would be hard put not cater to Israel's needs including veto power at the UNSC. Same applies to UK and Germany among other supporting nations of Israel. As Israel is not alone in committing genocide in Gaza. The driving force is behind Netanyahu is AIPAC. The more boycotting occurs, the better, and the faster Israel's ability to fund the war dries up. We can also pray that his own people are desperate for him to step down. Act on it sooner than later. Ben Gvir has revealed Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has had a pacemaker, fitted last year. Thank you."

But the point is Margo Robbie could make a straight bitch question her sexuality dressed in a fucking potato sack, like girlie was Barbie after all. It would take an active, conscious effort for most of us to make Margo Robbie look dumpy. And Chanel did it not once, not twice, but MULTIPLE TIMES. And on top of that, I can tell you as a Chanel and general handbag subreddit lurker with a Kanken tote purse currently wearing Costco socks, Lands End leggings, and a skater skirt from Amazon, they're RAPIDLY falling off as an aspirational brand for the every woman seeking to treat herself with a luxury designer good every once in awhile because their classic ballet flats and clutches now show wear and fall apart WAY too fast to justify the price and months to years of saving for a lot of gals. Between this, that, and Coco Chanel's Nazi connections, I honestly don't see Chanel surviving through gen alpha. But also like...?!?!?!? Oh my God yall EVOLVE. GET WITH THE TIMES. You may have been THE taste maker at one time but you're the Anna Wintour's fuck ass bob of fashion labels and there's probably a grand total of 17.32 fashionable 20-somethings in this world who'd fuck with that and 10 of them are probably Karoline Leavitt."

n1ckoa3,2025-07-04 18:31:45,en,REDDIT,"  Thanks for that. May I ask what is so schizoid about what I wrote, though? Is it not coherent? Am I using too many parentheses? I admit that I came out like a wreaking ball because I am, frankly, sick of people shitting on Bleeding Edge and seeing it for, like, at least 80% less than what it really is. Here's s'more A.B. stuff: American Beauty was written as a play in the early 1990s, partly inspired by the media circus that accompanied the Amy Fisher trial in 1992. Chapter 14 of Bleeding Edge contains a fictional play called Amy & Joey (an Off-Broadway musical). Bleeding Edge's Lester's name really was at least partially inspired by the role that Kevin Spacey took in American Beauty. Mason & Dixon anachronistically alludes to the Amy Fisher, Mary Jo Buttafuoco, and Joey Buttafuoco tragedy / media circus twice. Moving right along here: This isn't the only time reading-between-the lines leads one to come across movies or music videos that Pynchon worked into Bleeding Edge. Two other examples are “Quigley” (2003) and Aaron Carter's “That's How I Beat Shaq” (2000). To clarify further, at least about Quigley: Anthony Perkins' (the Norman Bates actor) wife died in the American Airlines Flight 11 plane that hit the World Trade Center. Her mother collaborated with Salvador Dalí and competed with the likes of Coco Chanel (knockoffs of this Nazi-supporter's products crop up in Chapter 2 of B.E.) Berry Berenson's son Oz was in a LOW budget b-movie alongside Garey Busey. The plot of this film basically sets up the first two paragraphs of Chapter 9 of Bleeding Edge (look to Busey's motorcycle accident results [the messages from {God} that he thought he was channeling in cryptic anagrams] and their connection to the bizarre [bizarre even for Pynchon] “DESPAIR” anagram from Chapter 9). The gargantuan coffeemaker from Chapter 7 that Vyrva calls “The Insomniac” may have been pulled right outta the first 25-minutes of Quigley. (The title of that film is part of where Pynchon got the name Axl Quigley from) The first name Axl could refer to the 1994, Nancy Kerrigan ice (yeah: ICE) skating attack. The Axel jump is a figure skating move that's unique for its forward takeoff. It could also refer to a the singer of a band that's mentioned in Bleeding Edge: Guns N' Roses Much of what takes place in the first few paragraphs of Chapter 9 relates to secrets kept “under the rose” (in confidence; under pledge of secrecy) … (See Roseman in CoL49 and the footsie he plays with Oedipa) … (see Ch 3 of Bleeding Edge and the 'FTSE' (Financial Times Stock Exchange 100 Index) that Horst [according to Maxine's wild imaginings] plays with women Maxine fears Horst has affairs with… women who're curiously named after brands of cigars)"

The late Carolyn Bessette is surging to the top of the pop culture zeitgeist again and her classic style is a part of the conversation. Ryan Murphy's upcoming series, American Love Story, featuring her love story with John F. Kennedy Jr., might have been the catalyst for the resurgence. Still, it's Bessette's fashion icon status that is making everyone take a deeper dive into her life again. TikTok is pushing the Bessette style narrative again as beauty and style mavens flock to the West Village in Manhattan to scoop up Charles J. Wahba tortoise-shell headbands sold at C.O. Bigelow pharmacy. It may seem like a simple accessory to some, but it's Bessette's relatable style that makes sense in a very expensive 2025 world. ""Carolyn represents this chic, quiet luxury style, I think many women want to emulate but feel they can't afford. So, the headbands provide an affordable and accessible way to participate, "" influencer Beverly Hart explained to The New York Post. Still, Bessette's fashion voice developed as a reaction to life in the public eye instead of a carefully curated image in the press. The 2024 biography, Once Upon a Time: The Captivating Life of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy by Elizabeth Beller, spoke to friends who dismissed the idea that Bessette was obsessed with her wardrobe. Pal Michelle Kessler thought Bessette would laugh at her ""fashion icon "" description. ""She was trying to be nothing of the sort. Carolyn was trying to have an interesting life and go about her day without interruption, "" Kessler said. The 2023 book, CBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: A Life in Fashion by Sunita Kumar Nair, shared a similar philosophy about JFK Jr.'s wife. ""She didn't seek fame but was carved in a certain light, a light she sometimes enjoyed but mostly eschewed, rarely speaking to the press. Instead, she used fashion as a vehicle for communication - at times to thwart the insatiable camera lens but mostly thriving in her chosen ensemble, "" Nair wrote in the book. Instead of Chanel and Christian Dior, Bessette chose ""the understated, tailored, and soft-yet-structured Calvin Klein, Prada, and Yohji Yamamoto garments, "" as noted by The Cut ""I think if she was alive today, she would still want to be a mystery, but fashion is where she showed herself, "" Bessette's former Calvin Klein coworker Stormy Stokes said in Nair's book. ""It was the part she was happy to display."" Before you go, click here to see all the best pictures of JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette.

La ficción está producida por los Javis y ha sido creada y dirigida por Nacho Vigalondo. El documental, por su parte, recoge los testimonios de los verdaderos protagonistas de la citada serie. Según ha adelantado 'verTele!' , ""es una inmersión emocional en el archivo televisivo y cultural de la España de los 2000.

Como colofón del evento, y entre lágrimas, la cantante se reencontró con Ingrid García-Jonsson, la actriz que encarna a la cantante en la serie. ""Has hecho una gran interpretación porque tienes un corazón de oro y una empatía tremenda. Gracias preciosa mía, jamás lo olvidaré. Te quiero "", ha proclamado Yurena, que le ha entregado a la actriz un ramo de flores.

mov_80DF2D23BA0ED30EB06044749F3D666B,2025-07-04 21:07:06,en,WEB,"  SortU Tiktok echoes a family noise: It is that of many and different bracelets worn in conjunction. The mantra is 'more is more', so the pulse turns into a canvas where materials, volumes and textures stratify. But how to wear more bracelets in the summer of 2025 avoiding the bazaar effect? Like every trend that landed on the platform, this common gesture has also been renamed: Bracelet Stackor pile of bracelets. Far from the idea of ​​a single protagonist accessory, this trend invites you to multiply, superimpose, compose. But the risk of sliding in the kitsch, between excesses and disorder, is around the corner. Mosaic effect: because it likes so much The boom comes from social networks, where the hashtag #bracelets collect millions of views And suggestions. Users show increasingly creative combinations: there are those who choose only shiny metals, those who play with the colorful resin, those who combine childhood jewelry -jewelry pendants. The idea is that of Create a visual story starting from what is worn: a sentimental mosaic made of charm, stones, engravings and contrasting textures. And even the big brands have not been looking at. Van Cleef & Arpelswith his Alhambra bracelets, is among the most cited on the platform, together also to Cartier, Aurélie Bidermann, or more accessible brands such as Dodus or Pandora. Also in Spiggia, Aurélie Bidmann. Back to the future: the 90s and the revival on the catwalks The stratification of the bracelets is not an absolute novelty. Already in 90s It was a symbol of a certain Bohemien aesthetic, made of leather, beads and souvenirs. The fashion shows were brought back: from Miu Miu his bangles stratified on the arm, a Saint Laurent Which offers maxi golden bracelets with architectural shapes. Chanel, Instead, it focuses on silver with architectural design. Today, however, the gesture changes meaning: it is no longer only accumulation, but intention to express itself. From the spring-summer 2025 fashion shows: at the top left Miu Miu, on the right Elie Saab. At the bottom left Saint Laurent, on the right Chanel. Harmony and character: how it really works The border between expression and confusionthere is to be admitted, it is thin. The key to a Bracelet Stack success is in knowing how to balance materials and volumes. Mix metal and fabric, opaque and brilliant, vintage and contemporary, but keeping consistency. Often one is enough Defined color palettesor a symbolic guiding thread, like a marine theme, botanist or abstract, To avoid the market effect. It is an approach that also works for celebrities: Bella Hadid It is the demonstration, with its stacking mixed with gucci vintage trousers or jacquemus look seen in Cannes, in which the bracelet becomes counterpoint to the minimalism of the outfit. The wrist, today, is the new white page of the look. A place where fashion meets identity and transforms it into daily gesture. I woman © RESERVED REPRODUCTION"

187434689_575,2025-07-04 21:16:03,en,WORDPRESS,"  The National Leadership conference on African American Health disparities and social justice took place June 25-29. The conference centers its work around the African American MSM community, but since last years conferenced welcomed Black Trans Men and others to participate. This year the conference was headed by its new acting Executive Director and CEO R. Wayne Woodson, Ph.D. The workshops that were provided during this conference spoke on the wide work that the community of networking organization have been during over the year. The conference themes around HIV and the continued work to end stigma and to bring ideas to better serve the communities as a whole. The conversation around homelessness and funding of programs were some of interests during the conference. Leadership Dominque Morgans ""The Halo Academy"" powered by The Fund for Trans Generations at Borealis Philanthropy speaker ready room spoke on the call to Donors to wake up to the fight was amazing. The room was filled with many black leaders that seem to share a call to the movement work of second chances. Stories shared by the Susan Burton's A New Way of Life Reentry Program gave the realities of women who deserve a second chance find that hope and help to get them there. Beautifully done docuseries on YouTube bring them to life. The workshop session on Navigating Housing for Black LGBTQ+Angelenos given by The AMAAD Institute also brought light to the growing disparity of homelessness around our country. While the talk was focused and centered around the work in LA the information translates for all areas. Leadership Executive Director Gerald Gartha, MBA and Housing Program Manager Chanel Lumiere gave vital information on the learning curves to starting a housing program. Exploring the areas of building relationships and how those relationships grow into partnerships to serve the community. The room also filled with eager and well participants to end the epidemic of homelessness. The organization offerings of various programs to serve the community is outstanding and is a blueprint on collective innovations to bring forth change. The conference this year was a noticeable change from last year as it was more intimate and seem to be connected to a smaller Sub Conference HISTORI HIV Implementation Science to Optimize Research Impact. The conversation around Research and HIV at the conference was great to see. The workshop held seem to be also centered around African Americans and the future of science and HIV. There were many other great moments of the conference like the Documentary on Friday of Marissa Miller the Founder of the National Trans Visibility March. Her story was compelling and gave an inside look at the woman behind the work and the Philanthropic Spirit. The exclusive screening and talkback filled us in on the courage and resilience that is needed to be leader and also a friend. Breath taking moments on living in your truth, navigating the world around family, standing up for your community and pasting the torch to future leaders all can be done. Inspiring and brilliantly told through her own words gives hope for the leaders in the room. The conference also welcomed a workshop on The Healing of the Arts in the HIV fight was given by your one and only and seemed to be received in good light. To end my final day of the conference the Saturday's breakfast started with a pleasant surprise The United State Representative Maxine Waters gave a heartfelt speech and call to us in the room. The 86-year-old powerhouse gave permission to "" ACTUP "" through this time in our country as we go through what she has already fought once before in the CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT. What a privilege to have shared and heard her in the same space and time in history.

n1dw1c2,2025-07-04 22:59:46,en,REDDIT,"  It did take forever and it drove me to therapy which I typically avoid like the plague. Because I was not used to doing that. I got married the 1st time at 17 n quickly had 4 children so I had always been on medicaid until my new husband so this was my first experience with a traditional health insurance. I am used to doctors throwing all the tests at the wall to see what sticks so I was baffled. You always hear that you get worse care with medicaid but I had the exact opposite opinion. In fact, when I broke my foot, my soon broke his leg and we ended up going to the same ortho. My son receives disability so he had medicaid while I have united and I literally got to see and experience a side by side comparison. I had a broken heel for 3 weeks with dr after dr trying to tell me I sprained my ankle while im telling them I've sprained my ankle plenty of times thats not what I was feeling and trying to hardest to not lose my shit on them. Finally got an mri and they found it. I ended up switching orthos to a foot specialist and found out I actually broke my heel and had micro fractures going across the top middle of my foot as well as a weird shaded thing in my ankle. I broke it Feb 2023 and I still have days that it hurts more than that day. I am shoe obsessed and had Finally completed my collection,  except Chanel, but now none of my shoes fit and if I stand more than 10 minutes I swell up and feel like im standing in a pile of fire ants. Thats what I consider a good pain day. I always have memory problems like when you forget why you went in a room except the time it scared me most was I was standing at the kitchen counter with a knife in one hand and a tomato in front of me. But even seeing what I was doing, I couldn't remember what I was doing. I dont think sleep effects it much though. I know it used to when I was younger but now its just the longer im up, the harder it is to sleep. I have issues falling asleep and staying asleep. If im not trying to sleep and just let it happen, I can fall asleep easy. I enjoy falling asleep with the TV on because it relaxes me and takes the pressure off. My husband can't stand it though so I could be in that happy place right before you fall asleep and he turns off the TV and bam! Im wide awake again! I also always have the attention span of a gold fish so I dont think it could get worse lol. I do notice more pain and I get this feeling like something is missing. It's kind of close to the feeling that you forgot something but its like something inside of me is missing and get kinda whiny. I definitely feel like all of my procedures effect me differently each time. It's definitely not a steady drop in efficiency either. It's all very random and there's no way to predict it. I've tried botox, steroid injections, ketamine infusions, nerve blocks and nothing is ever consistent. The only suggestion I have not tried is the spinal cord stimulator because that terrifies the ever loving fuck outta me! Botox though can be finicky if you dont follow after care instructions. You get tiny bubbles under your skin and if you move them, they are no longer where they need to be.

只要能吃苦，就有吃不完的苦。 全球零售巨头沃尔玛对这句中文梗应该颇有同感。 它刚刚花10年时间解决一场“中年危机”，适应了电商时代，挡住了亚马逊的冲击，公司营收和净利在2024、2025财年都实现了不错的增长。 但就像中年人的世界里总有解不完的难题，进入2025年的沃尔玛，迎来了包括特朗普关税政策在内的一系列不确定因素，接下来的业绩，恐怕也很难保持过去两年的高增长。 受政策影响，这家以性价比著称的零售企业还在美国对部分商品进行了涨价——这可以看作是一场对自己的背刺。 在消费世界里，贵的可以更贵，比如CHANEL年年涨价年年有人追着买，甚至把它当成理财产品看升值空间，但蜜雪冰城把冰激凌和柠檬水卖贵一块钱，是要做好挨骂的心理建设的。 沃尔玛过去几年的业绩增长，其实也不是靠把便宜货卖给勤俭持家的人。 沃尔玛CFO约翰·瑞尼(John Rainey)表示，2025财年第三季度，沃尔玛约75%的增长来自年收入超过10万美元的家庭，咨询公司Morning Consult的调查也显示，年收入10万美元以上的家庭中在沃尔玛购物的比例，自2019年的77%上升至2024年的89%。 而十年前，调研机构Kantar Retail数据给出的沃尔玛顾客画像是：年收入多在5万美元以下，年龄主要为45岁以上——翻译过来就是：扣扣搜搜的中年人。 其实，全世界中产都具备着类似的消费习惯：既要性价比，又要体面。 他们的身影会出现在农村大集上，但这更多是体验烟火气的快乐，他们不会真的为了5块钱一兜的黄瓜坚持复购。 但叮咚买菜的8点打折夜市、好特卖4块钱一瓶的巴黎水，是能卖到他们心坎上的。 所以沃尔玛在这几年增加了不少高级的SKU，提升门店体验，比如使用让人更舒适的灯光色温，增强数字体验，拼命甩掉以前那个廉价、传统的老标签。 一个更重要的进展是，它终于搞定了电商业务——一个它从20多年前就开始涉足的板块。 老大哥的眼光还是很好的，但前期重视程度不够，也没什么章法，发展太慢。 好在它后面补课很努力，慢慢搭起电商基建。 疫情再给了关键性的催化：2020年，沃尔玛美国的电商业务实现了79%的销售增长，到2021年时，它已经成为美国电商行业的老二，仅次于亚马逊。 2025财年，沃尔玛在全球的电商销售额达到1210亿美元，且最近9个季度的增速不低于15%。 电商业务在公司总销售额中的占比达到了17.94%——10年前，这个数字只有2.53%。 图源：沃尔玛2025财年年报
从财务数据来看，沃尔玛就像是顺利进入新赛道的中年人，又过上了好日子：
沃尔玛大卖场的销售额，三年增长超900亿美元，从2022财年的4942.06亿美元达到2025财年的5843亿美元——定位类似的家乐福，在相似时间段的2021年和2024年，销售额分别为812.45亿欧元和945.5亿欧元，按照当下汇率，三年增长额不到160亿美元。 02
人类历史往往是由一些关键人物推动的，老公司们的进化也是如此。 在沃尔玛长达20多年的电商业务故事里，有两位关键人物：一位是在2010年组建起专门电商部门的CEO麦道克(Mike Duke)，相当于把电商部门变成了正规军；一位是他的后一任CEO董明伦（Doug McMillon）。 在2014年2月接任CEO时，董明伦表面风光，47岁的他，是除创始人山姆·沃尔顿外，沃尔玛历史上最年轻的CEO。 他对沃尔玛足够了解，从基层采购员干起，工作接近25年。 过往经历也证明他能打硬仗：他曾经在沃尔玛受金融危机影响而业绩下滑时，临危受命，出任国际业务总裁兼CEO，很快，国际业务成为2011~2013财年公司增长最快的部门。 但提振一块业务，跟带动一艘大船转向，根本上是两回事。 你能把西红柿鸡蛋做好吃，未必能撑起一桌体面的家宴。 2014年的沃尔玛就像是一艘需要打补丁的大船。 营收增速只有个位数，还在2014财年达到有史以来的最低值——1.6%。 净利润也在2012财年出现20年来首次下滑后，于2014财年再次下滑。 更糟糕的是，这艘大船好像有点迷失了方向。 当时美国的电商业务热火朝天。 2010年~2013年，美国电子商务零售销售规模由1654亿美元增长至2630亿美元，平均年增速达到16.6%，远超实体零售业同期6.2%的平均年增速。 而沃尔玛的电商业务在2014财年刚突破100亿美元的销售额——这相当于隔壁亚马逊电子零售业务在2013年的增长额。 董明伦干了几件事情：
1、抄作业。 对标亚马逊，从动态价格体系到电子支付，再到发展无人机配送、与出租车公司合作提高即时配送能力，沃尔玛“抄”得很认真。 2、使出“钞能力”，通过收购的方式快速补齐短板。 从2014年-2018年，沃尔玛几乎在全球撒钱，花费超过200亿美元收购了超20家公司。 其中的大头，160亿美元用来买了一家印度电商公司Flipkart——它一度在印度做到了市场第一，还在人工智能方面积累不少。 收购带来的另一大资源是人才。 董明伦在2016年收购美国初创电商平台Jet后，直接安排创始人马克·劳尔（Marc Lore）担任沃尔玛电商部门主管。 也是从这开始，沃尔玛的电商生意挤进了快车道。 在中国市场，沃尔玛尝试过收购1号店来发展电商，最终变成与京东合作，利用后者的配送服务解决物流问题。 这个模式后来被复制到日本，合作对象是当地最大的电商平台乐天。 3、调整店型，抓“小”放“大”。 传统的沃尔玛门店在电商业务中有了“前置仓”的角色，相比大而全，快捷更重要。 于是，沃尔玛放缓了传统门店的扩张速度，对既有门店进行升级改造，做小店。 2015、2016财年，沃尔玛在美国开了260家社区店和中小型门店，而大卖场只开了177家。 这些动作的共同特点就是：费钱、无法立竿见影出成绩、拖累财报数据。 资本市场显然是有怀疑的，2016年下半年，连长期持有沃尔玛股票的巴菲特，也因沃尔玛与亚马逊之间的增速差距过大，选择大幅抛售。..."

人类历史往往是由一些关键人物推动的，老公司们的进化也是如此。 在沃尔玛长达20多年的电商业务故事里，有两位关键人物：一位是在2010年组建起专门电商部门的CEO麦道克(Mike Duke)，相当于把电商部门变成了正规军；一位是他的后一任CEO董明伦（Doug McMillon）。 在2014年2月接任CEO时，董明伦表面风光，47岁的他，是除创始人山姆·沃尔顿外，沃尔玛历史上最年轻的CEO。 他对沃尔玛足够了解，从基层采购员干起，工作接近25年。 过往经历也证明他能打硬仗：他曾经在沃尔玛受金融危机影响而业绩下滑时，临危受命，出任国际业务总裁兼CEO，很快，国际业务成为2011~2013财年公司增长最快的部门。 但提振一块业务，跟带动一艘大船转向，根本上是两回事。 你能把西红柿鸡蛋做好吃，未必能撑起一桌体面的家宴。 2014年的沃尔玛就像是一艘需要打补丁的大船。 营收增速只有个位数，还在2014财年达到有史以来的最低值——1.6%。 净利润也在2012财年出现20年来首次下滑后，于2014财年再次下滑。 更糟糕的是，这艘大船好像有点迷失了方向。 当时美国的电商业务热火朝天。 2010年~2013年，美国电子商务零售销售规模由1654亿美元增长至2630亿美元，平均年增速达到16.6%，远超实体零售业同期6.2%的平均年增速。 而沃尔玛的电商业务在2014财年刚突破100亿美元的销售额——这相当于隔壁亚马逊电子零售业务在2013年的增长额。 董明伦干了几件事情： 
1、抄作业。 对标亚马逊，从动态价格体系到电子支付，再到发展无人机配送、与出租车公司合作提高即时配送能力，沃尔玛“抄”得很认真。 2、使出“钞能力”，通过收购的方式快速补齐短板。 从2014年-2018年，沃尔玛几乎在全球撒钱，花费超过200亿美元收购了超20家公司。 其中的大头，160亿美元用来买了一家印度电商公司Flipkart——它一度在印度做到了市场第一，还在人工智能方面积累不少。 收购带来的另一大资源是人才。 董明伦在2016年收购美国初创电商平台Jet后，直接安排创始人马克·劳尔（Marc Lore）担任沃尔玛电商部门主管。 也是从这开始，沃尔玛的电商生意挤进了快车道。 在中国市场，沃尔玛尝试过收购1号店来发展电商，最终变成与京东合作，利用后者的配送服务解决物流问题。 这个模式后来被复制到日本，合作对象是当地最大的电商平台乐天。 3、调整店型，抓“小”放“大”。 传统的沃尔玛门店在电商业务中有了“前置仓”的角色，相比大而全，快捷更重要。 于是，沃尔玛放缓了传统门店的扩张速度，对既有门店进行升级改造，做小店。 2015、2016财年，沃尔玛在美国开了260家社区店和中小型门店，而大卖场只开了177家。 这些动作的共同特点就是：费钱、无法立竿见影出成绩、拖累财报数据。 资本市场显然是有怀疑的，2016年下半年，连长期持有沃尔玛股票的巴菲特，也因沃尔玛与亚马逊之间的增速差距过大，选择大幅抛售。..."

Tra queste ci sono anche Kylie e Kendall Jenner, le sorelle più famose e seguite d'America, che dopo aver presenziato alle nozze del fondatore di Amazon hanno deciso di concedersi qualche giorno di relax in Toscana. Kylie e Kendall Jenner hanno pubblicato sui loro profili Instagram scatti immersi nella natura senese. Vacanze in Toscana per Kylie e Kendall Jenner Se Bezos e la sua neo-sposa si sono spostati in Sicilia, nella splendida Taormina, per la luna di miele, altre star hanno scelto il cuore verde del nostro Paese per proseguire il loro soggiorno italiano. In particolare, le due sorelle Kylie e Kendall Jenner si stanno godendo giornate lontane dai riflettori e dal glamour, soggiornando in un resort esclusivo in Toscana. Le immagini condivise dalle due nei social raccontano di colazioni all'aperto, pranzi tipici, passeggiate tra i sentieri di campagna e momenti di relax e divertimento in piscina.  La meta prescelta dalle due imprenditrici e influencer è Borgo Santo Pietro, un resort cinque stelle immerso nella campagna senese, precisamente a Chiusdino. Borgo Santo Pietro, oltre a essere un hotel di lusso, è una tenuta agricola di 120 ettari, dove si producono miele, olio extravergine di oliva e verdure biologiche utilizzate nei ristoranti del resort. Questo relais di lusso che conta ventidue camere e suite, distribuite tra la villa principale e residenze indipendenti immerse nel verde. Qui ogni camera è pensata per offrire agli ospiti un'esperienza esclusiva in un contesto intimo e riservato, lontano da occhi indiscreti.  Con loro, in vacanza, ci sono anche i figli di Kylie, avuti dalla relazione con il rapper Travis Scott. Una scelta che conferma quanto la Toscana sia amata non solo per le sue città d'arte, ma anche per i paesaggi rurali e l'ottima cucina. Chi sono Kylie e Kendall Jenner Kylie e Kendall Jenner sono le sorelle minori di Kim Kardashian, imprenditrice che ideato nuovi brand nel settore beauty e moda. Le Jenner sono note per essere tra le donne più influenti al mondo, imprenditrici di successo e icone di stile seguite da centinaia di milioni di persone.  Entrambe sono diventate celebri grazie al reality show americano “Keeping Up with the Kardashians”, che raccontava la vita quotidiana della famiglia Kardashian – Kendall. Da allora, la loro ascesa nel mondo della moda, dello spettacolo e dell'imprenditoria non si è più fermata. Kylie Jenner, classe 1997, è fondatrice di Kylie Cosmetics, azienda di make-up che l'ha resa una delle imprenditrici più giovani e ricche d'America. Con i suoi 393 milioni di follower su Instagram, Kylie detta tendenze nel mondo della bellezza e della moda.  Kendall Jenner, nata nel 1995, è una delle top model più richieste nel mondo della moda. Ha sfilato per le più grandi maison di moda, da Chanel a Versace, ed è volto di campagne pubblicitarie mondiali. Con 287 milioni di follower su Instagram, Kendall è uno dei personaggi più famosi nel panorama americano."

mov_F98AA371DA00A044B9988B8AFEF482AA,2025-07-05 06:01:02,en,WEB,"  These comfy shoes keep older folks in mind with features like orthopedic support, roomy toe boxes and Velcro straps. For people who walk frequently, choosing the right walking shoe is super important to prevent your feet from aching and developing or worsening painful foot conditions. But wearing the proper supportive footwear is especially essential for older adults, said Dr. Chanel J. Perkins, a board-certified podiatrist based in Texas. “Supportive shoes help maintain balance and alignment, which are necessities in this population since they are at a greater fall risk,” she told us. “They also help decrease pedal muscle fatigue and overall soreness since biomechanics forces are evenly distributed throughout the shoe.” Perkins described the best shoes for older people as ones that are lightweight and breathable to prevent sweaty feet. They should also be well-cushioned, have good traction on the soles to prevent slips and falls and be easy to get on and off. If you or a loved one is in need of a new pair of walking shoes, consider the ones recommended below by Perkins and other podiatrists. 1. A pair of Brooks sneakers that older women can't stop buying This Brooks Ghost sneaker is known for its signature cushioning, which provides firm support and a midsole that evenly absorbs the impact of your foot, no matter how it lands. We couldn't help but include this sneaker as an editor's pick. In previous reporting, Shopping editor Emily Ruane noted that her mom and her daughters' nanny — both active older women in their 60s — rely on the exact same pair of Ghost running shoes to stay light on their feet while they garden, run after kids (and grandkids) and do a whole lot of walking. Her mother has undergone bunion surgery and has hammer toes, and likes that the shoes are available in wide widths to accommodate her custom orthotics. She finds the toe box to be roomy and well-constructed enough to comfortably accommodate her feet. (She's actually on her second pair; the first lasted her almost four years before she needed to replace them a little under a year ago.) Ruane's children's nanny logs thousands of steps a day, and she told her that, “[t]hese shoes are the best.” And our readers (and reviewers) tend to agree. Get them from Amazon for $148.77+ in women's (available in sizes 5–13, four widths, and 14 colors) or from Zappos for $149.95 in men's (available in sizes 7–15, four widths, and eight colors). 2. Skechers Go Walk Arch Fit sneaker Dr. Mireille Blanchette, a board-certified podiatrist based in New Jersey, recommended this lace-up Skechers sneaker because of its comfort and the fact that it's machine washable to help prevent bacteria buildup. ""Elders can sometimes develop foot fungus because they might not always be able to clean well between the toes and that can create a great environment for fungus,"" she said. The shoe is designed with a pull tab on the back to make it easier to put on and take off and is lined in breathable fabric to promote air circulation. It comes in multiple colors and in women's sizes 5.5–10.5 and men's sizes 7–15, both with wide options available. Promising review: ""Bought these shoes for my mom. She needed something with good support that was energizing and helped with footing and movement. These shoes did the job. Her footing, posture and movement have improved tremendously. I bought them for her because I own a pair and have excellent wear with them."" —Mom Get them from Zappos in women's for $74.53+ (originally $90) or in men's for $100. 3. Men's Adidas Ultraboost 20 sneaker Perkins recommended this Adidas option, which is made from recycled plastics and has supportive interior padding and great grip on the sole. It comes in men's sizes 4–14 and in multiple colors, including black, orange, black/purple, gray/mint and white. It has a sock-like fit and a ""boosting"" feature, a super responsive midsole that makes it easier to take steps. Promising review: ""Extraordinarily comfortable shoe. I have flat feet, getting older with hip creaks here and there. My legs and joints feel great when wearing these shoes. Ultraboost is impressive stuff."" —Amazon customer Get them from Amazon for $118.99+. 4. Women's Orthofeet Francis walking shoe Available in multiple colors, including blue, pink, maroon, gray and black, this walking shoe has a cushioned footbed and orthotic insole designed to help those with various foot conditions such as plantar fasciitis. It also has a roomy toe box for added comfort and bunion and hammertoe relief. ""The slip-on design makes it perfect for seniors who have a hard time bending over to tie a shoe or for those with arthritis in the hands who find difficulty with tying laces,"" Perkins said. It comes in women's sizes 5–12, with narrow, wide and extra-wide and extra-extra-wide options. Promising review: ""I bought these walking shoes for my sister's birthday...."
mov_DD5460C3F6890BB8502192BE529181DA,2025-07-05 06:24:07,fa,WEB,  SPR_COMBO[fa]به گزارش خبرنگار اقتصادی خبرگزاری تسنیم؛ صنعت نساجی ایران، با وجود تمام چالش‌های محیطی و سیاسی، از جمله تحریم‌های بین‌المللی، دارای ظرفیت‌های فراوان و مزیت‌های نسبی منحصر به فردی است که کمتر به آن توجه شده است. این ظرفیت‌ها که از منابع طبیعی، نیروی انسانی خلاق و بازار مصرف داخلی نشأت می‌گیرد، همراه با توانمندی‌های فناورانه و ابتکارات نوآورانه، زمینه‌ساز رشد و توسعه پایدار در این صنعت می‌باشد. نگاه به بیرون و انتظار رفع تحریم‌ها یا مذاکرات بین‌المللی هرگز نباید نقطه اتکا و راه‌حل اصلی توسعه صنعت نساجی ایران باشد. بلکه باید با اتکا به دارایی‌های خود و استفاده هوشمندانه از فرصت‌های بومی و جهانی، مسیری مستقل و مقتدرانه برای پیشرفت این صنعت طراحی کنیم.  در این مقاله با مرور 40 ظرفیت کلیدی ایران و 27 ابتکار عمل در صنعت نساجی در سطح جهانی، چارچوبی عملیاتی و مبتنی بر واقعیت‌های کشور ارائه شده که می‌تواند ایران را از بند محدودیت‌ها رها ساخته و به جایگاه واقعی خود در بازارهای جهانی برساند. در همین زمینه بیشتر بخوانید الف) 28 تجربه جهانی در صنعت پوشاک و نساجی 1. انگلستان – آغاز صنعتی‌سازی با صنعت نساجی در انقلاب صنعتی قرن 18 انگلستان نخستین کشوری بود که در اواخر قرن 18 با بهره‌گیری از ماشین بخار و سازماندهی کارخانه‌ای، صنعت نساجی را به نقطه آغاز انقلاب صنعتی تبدیل کرد. توسعه ماشین‌های بافندگی، پیدایش کارخانه‌های متمرکز در منچستر و لیدز، و بهره‌برداری از استعمار هند به‌عنوان منبع پنبه خام، این کشور را در قرن 19 به قطب بی‌بدیل تولید پارچه بدل کرد. دولت بریتانیا با حفاظت از نوآوری‌های تکنولوژیک (مانند ماشین اسپینینگ جنی) و ممنوعیت صادرات ابزار تولید تا مدت‌ها از سلطه خود دفاع کرد. تجربه بریتانیا نشان می‌دهد که نساجی می‌تواند پیشران توسعه صنعتی و آغازگر زنجیره‌های بزرگ اشتغال باشد. 2. هند – احیای صنعت نساجی در قرن بیست و یکم با تمرکز بر پنبه و صادرات هند در سال‌های اخیر با صادرات بیش از 40 میلیارد دلار پوشاک و پارچه، به یکی از غول‌های جهانی در صنعت نساجی تبدیل شده است. این کشور با بهره‌گیری از پنبه داخلی، نیروی کار ارزان، و سیاست‌های حمایتی از زنجیره تولید، به‌ویژه در ایالت‌هایی مانند تامیل‌نادو، گجرات و ماهاراشترا، توانسته است مزیت مقیاس را تثبیت کند. نهادهایی مانند وزارت نساجی هند با ارائه یارانه صادرات، تسهیل‌گری در تأسیس پارک‌های صنعتی و ایجاد زنجیره‌های خوشه‌ای، این صنعت را به یکی از پایه‌های توسعه منطقه‌ای تبدیل کرده‌اند. هند همچنین با توسعه برندهای داخلی مانند FabIndia، در پی ارتقاء ارزش افزوده و طراحی بومی است. 3. ترکیه – توسعه صنعت پوشاک با تمرکز بر صادرات و برندهای بومی ترکیه در دو دهه گذشته با تمرکز بر صادرات به اروپا، برندهای موفقی مانند LC Waikiki، Koton و Mavi را در بازارهای بین‌المللی تثبیت کرده است. سیاست‌های ترکیه در دهه 1990 شامل آزادسازی کنترل دولتی، خصوصی‌سازی صنایع نساجی و تأسیس مناطق آزاد بود. استان‌هایی مانند دنیزلی، بورسا، و قاضی‌انتپ به مراکز تخصصی تولید پارچه و پوشاک بدل شدند. ترکیه همچنین زنجیره کامل از نخ‌ریسی تا طراحی مد و بازاریابی بین‌المللی را توسعه داد. تجربیات این کشور نشان می‌دهد که پیوند میان صنعت، صادرات، طراحی و برندینگ می‌تواند صنعت پوشاک را از خام‌فروشی به قدرت‌آفرینی اقتصادی برساند. 4. بنگلادش – ظهور به‌عنوان دومین صادرکننده پوشاک جهان با نیروی کار ارزان و سیاست تشویقی بنگلادش با صادرات بیش از 38 میلیارد دلار پوشاک در سال 2022، پس از چین دومین صادرکننده پوشاک دنیاست. نقطه قوت این کشور، نیروی کار بسیار ارزان و نظام مالیاتی و تجاری خاص مناطق ویژه صادراتی است. سیاست‌هایی چون معافیت مالیاتی، عدم وجود تعرفه بر واردات مواد اولیه، و حمایت از تأسیس کارخانه‌های کوچک و متوسط، باعث شده بیش از 4000 کارخانه پوشاک در بنگلادش فعال باشند. دولت بنگلادش با حمایت از آموزش زنان در مناطق روستایی و ایجاد زنجیره‌های خانوادگی تولید، از صنعت پوشاک به‌عنوان اهرمی برای توسعه فراگیر استفاده کرده است. 5. چین – ساخت زنجیره‌ کامل نساجی از پنبه‌کاری تا برندینگ جهانی چین از دهه 1980 با سیاست درهای باز، صنعت نساجی را به یکی از پیشران‌های صنعتی خود بدل ساخت. زنجیره تولید در چین، از کشت پنبه در ایالت‌های غربی، تا تولید ماشین‌آلات نساجی، دوخت، طراحی و فروش بین‌المللی گسترده است. مناطق ویژه اقتصادی مانند شنژن و شانگهای میزبان برندهای جهانی و کارخانه‌های بزرگ پوشاک شدند. علاوه بر تولید انبوه، چین با شرکت‌هایی مانند Bosideng یا Peacebird وارد حوزه طراحی و برندینگ جهانی نیز شد. دولت چین همچنین با انعقاد توافق‌های تجارت آزاد در جنوب شرق آسیا، صادرات نساجی را تسهیل کرده است. 6. ایتالیا – تقویت برندهای لوکس با تمرکز بر طراحی، کیفیت و مد پایدار ایتالیا به‌واسطه برندهایی چون Gucci، Prada، Armani و Dolce & Gabbana نماد طراحی فاخر در صنعت پوشاک است. این کشور زنجیره‌ای از کارگاه‌های خانوادگی، طراحان مستقل، دانشگاه‌های مد، و شرکت‌های بافندگی باکیفیت را در شمال ایتالیا – به‌ویژه در منطقه لمباردی – توسعه داده است. دولت با حمایت از صادرات برندهای لوکس، شرکت در نمایشگاه‌های جهانی، و استفاده از ابزار دیپلماسی فرهنگی، صنعت مد را به یک قدرت نرم بدل کرده است. تجربه ایتالیا نشان می‌دهد که تمرکز بر ارزش افزوده، طراحی و تولید محدود، برخلاف تولید انبوه، می‌تواند منجر به موقعیت ممتاز در بازار جهانی شود. 7. ویتنام – استفاده از توافقات تجارت آزاد برای توسعه صنعت پوشاک صادراتی ویتنام با بهره‌گیری از توافقنامه‌های تجارت آزاد با اتحادیه اروپا (EVFTA)، کره‌جنوبی، ژاپن و کشورهای ASEAN، تعرفه‌های صادراتی را کاهش داده و سرمایه‌گذاران خارجی را جذب کرده است. شهرهایی مانند هوشی‌مین و هانوی به مراکز تولید پوشاک برای برندهای بین‌المللی مانند H&M و Zara تبدیل شده‌اند. دولت با تأسیس پارک‌های صنعتی، حمایت از آموزش فنی در مدارس و معافیت مالیاتی برای سرمایه‌گذاری خارجی، رشد سریعی را در صنعت پوشاک رقم زده است....

E os rumores são verdadeiros: as peças de arquivo de marcas de luxo como Hermès, Louis Vuitton, Versace, Chanel e Dolce & Gabbana, que têm feito todos os criadores de conteúdo de moda comentarem e especularem, são, sim, do próprio guarda-roupa da atriz. Mas não se deixe enganar pelas aparências… À medida que a história de Mentiras, da Amazon Prime Video, se desenrola, a linha entre o que Belinda emprestou de seu próprio armário e o que ficou a cargo de Claudia Sandoval — a figurinista responsável por recriar a moda dos anos 80 usada por Daniela (sua personagem) e os demais — é bastante tênue. Ao mesmo tempo, foi ela quem deu aos personagens uma identidade própria expressa pelas roupas. E essa não foi uma tarefa simples. ""Há por trás uma pesquisa super intensa, aqui estamos explorando os personagens muito mais a fundo. Antes era uma peça de duas horas, agora são oito episódios"", comenta. Esse trabalho envolve questionar tudo sobre o personagem: quem ele é, quem são seus pais, por que se veste como se veste. Maeve Jinkings é capa Pride da Vogue Brasil ""Sempre tive o 'não' como ponto de partida"", diz Nany People Liliane Rocha: ""Amar é sempre um ato revolucionário"" O figurino de Belinda em Mentiras, a Série “Quando você entra no mundo da Daniela, tudo é rosa”, conta Sandoval. “As provas de figurino duravam horas e horas. Houve uma colaboração, porque ela, como todos os atores, tem um ponto de vista sobre seu personagem.” Assim se alinham as necessidades técnicas da produção — como o figurino aparecerá nos cenários — com a visão que os atores têm sobre seus próprios papéis. Com Belinda, em especial, um dos desafios foi conciliar sua agenda com os longos períodos de prova de figurino, já que, ao mesmo tempo, ela trabalhava no lançamento do álbum Indómita. “Daniela, se não me engano, tem cerca de 38 trocas de roupa na série.” Em um movimento inesperado — e pouco comum —, a atriz abriu seu guarda-roupa para Sandoval, pois sabia que algumas de suas peças combinariam perfeitamente com a personagem. “Belinda tem roupas que parecem de museu, é impressionante.” Entre elas, um casaco vermelho em forma de coração que Hedi Slimane criou para a coleção ready-to-wear de outono-inverno 2016 — justamente inspirada na moda dos anos 80. Também aparecem uma bolsa Louis Vuitton de edição limitada com penas rosa, um conjunto de camisa e calça da Versace usado como pijama, um vestido da Blumarine e, claro, sua icônica bolsa Hermès rosa-claro. “Há muitos momentos bem pequenos em que Daniela aparece e que mostram várias dessas trocas de roupa — como no flashback do avião e no da estreia no tapete vermelho. E esses momentos foram perfeitos para que Belinda nos emprestasse peças espetaculares do seu armário.” Depois, havia o ""look herói"", a roupa principal que Daniela usa durante toda a sequência na mansão Mijares. “O rosa, né? Aquele da Chanel”, me arrisco a dizer. “Não é Chanel, nós fizemos!” , responde Claudia. Em termos de produção, era preciso um traje que Belinda pudesse usar na cena mais longa da série — aquela que conduz a narrativa. Ele precisava ser imediatamente reconhecível. “O tailleur da Chanel que todos conhecem — se não for pela Jackie Kennedy, é pela Marge Simpson.” Um visual clássico e perfeito, que poderia facilmente ser confundido com outra peça preciosa do armário de Belinda. “Mandamos buscar o tweed em Nova York, recebemos vários tecidos e esse foi o escolhido depois de testarmos em câmera para ver como aparecia. Fizemos três versões idênticas para trocar durante as gravações.” Belinda veste um tailleur de tweed criado pela equipe de figurino de ""Mentiras"" — Foto: Divulgação/Maria Grinda / Amazon Prime México Quando falamos da estética da juventude de Daniela, surgem referências como os filmes Heathers e As Patricinhas de Beverly Hills, especialmente quando o visual pende mais para os anos 90. Algumas roupas eram originais dos anos 80, mas o desafio era levá-las ao universo todo rosa de Daniela. Por isso, o figurino foi recriado a partir de moldes originais da época, mas nos tons e formas que representassem a personagem. “Mas sempre havia o desafio de fazer tudo ter sentido. Daniela não tinha estilo só porque usava marca. Daniela tinha estilo porque ela tinha estilo, sabe?” Belinda, como Daniela, usando um conjunto esportivo rosa. — Foto: Maria Grinda / Amazon Prime México A figurinista de Mentiras, a série Claudia Sandoval é a figurinista de Mentiras, la serie, da Amazon Prime Video. Sua trajetória começou como estudante de moda no Centro (CDMX). Após a graduação, mudou-se para Nova York para continuar os estudos e lá começou a trabalhar em seus primeiros projetos com Ana Terrazas, com quem colaborou em produções como Roma, de Alfonso Cuarón, e Bardo, de Alejandro González Iñárritu, como supervisora de figurino.

Louis Vuitton、Chanel、Dior、Cartier、Hermès、YSL、Givenchy……
有没有发现，它们几乎都来自——法国‼️
这些品牌，构成了魅力法兰西🇫🇷的标志。 👑 一切从“太阳王”路易十四开始…
法国的奢侈品文化并非偶然，而是从王权时代就被“刻进DNA”。 17世纪，路易十四一边打造凡尔赛宫🌟，一边成立了皇家制造厂，让镜子这种奢侈品开始国产化。 奢侈品从王公贵族的宫廷生活延伸至工艺品、香水、家具🪑与时装👗，奠定了法国“时尚与奢华”的国家品牌。 为什么法国能称霸奢侈品界？ 🧐
这不是偶然，是一场“国家级的精心策划”：
1⃣ 历史文化传承：早在路易十四时代，奢华就已渗透进法国文化
2⃣ 政府全力扶持：法国政府长期为奢侈时尚行业提供资金、打击假货、保护品牌
3⃣ 手工艺精神：传承工坊文化，注重细节与品质
4⃣本地化营销：如在中国市场，会推出中式节日限定款
5⃣ 营造稀缺性：通过限量发售、候补名单营造“买不到”的高端感
6⃣银幕上的加持与文化影响：从赫本到梦露，明星效应强化法国品牌影响力✨
7⃣高端生活方式打造：不只是衣服包包，更是一种“精致的生活方式”
🫅强大的奢侈品集团
就像美国有科技四巨头 GAFA（Google、Amazon、Facebook、Apple）
法国也有自己的奢侈品四巨头——KHOL：
▪️Kering开云集团：旗下有Gucci、YSL、Balenciaga、BV等。 ▪️Hermès爱马仕：独立但实力强劲，球最难买的品牌之一，以手工工艺闻名。 ▪️L'Oréal欧莱雅：美妆界的王者，旗下包含Lancôme、YSL Beauty、Kiehl's等
▪️LVMH路威酩轩：涵盖Louis Vuitton、Dior、Celine、Fendi等80+品品牌。 这些集团凭借并购➕品牌矩阵➕高端战略，牢牢掌控全球市场话语权。 法国奢侈品，是艺术、工艺、身份与文化的集合。 不是一只包，而是一个故事📖
不是一瓶香水，而是一段传承💫
所以当你买下那件“Made in France”的奢侈品时，
其实你也成了这段浪漫历史的见证者之一。 💬 你最爱的法国🇫🇷奢侈品牌是哪个？ 怎么看待法国在奢侈品界的地位？ 欢迎留言聊聊💬#法国留学diy #法国 #法国留学申请"

Huế mở phiên sơ thẩm, xét xử ba bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương (SN 1992), Phạm Thanh Long (SN 1992) và Nguyễn Thu Trinh (SN 1992, cùng trú phường Xuân Phú, TP. Huế) về các tội “Lừa đảo chiếm đoạt tài sản” và “Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản”. Hội đồng xét xử tuyên phạt Lê Thị Hồng Phương 14 năm tù về tội “Lừa đảo chiếm đoạt tài sản”. Phạm Thanh Long bị tuyên phạt 5 năm tù, còn Nguyễn Thu Trinh lĩnh mức án 3 năm 6 tháng tù cùng về tội “Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản”. Hình ảnh các bị cáo tại tòa. Ảnh: Công lý Theo cáo trạng, đầu năm 2021, Lê Thị Hồng Phương kinh doanh online các mặt hàng như thực phẩm chức năng, mỹ phẩm, túi xách, nước hoa, đồng hồ... mang thương hiệu nổi tiếng như Hermes, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Versace. Để có vốn mở rộng hoạt động, Phương kêu gọi vợ chồng Long và Trinh góp vốn đầu tư. Nhóm này lập nhóm chat “Kim Monology Group” trên ứng dụng Viber để thực hiện giao dịch. Phương chủ động soạn các đơn hàng, ghi rõ thời gian hoàn vốn và mức lãi suất từ 10% đến 100% để thu hút góp vốn từ Long, Trinh và những người quen của họ. Mỗi đơn hàng có giá trị từ 10 triệu đồng đến hơn 4 tỷ đồng. Quá trình đầu tư ban đầu suôn sẻ, lợi nhuận cao khiến nhiều người tiếp tục rót vốn. Vợ chồng Long – Trinh cũng hưởng lợi từ việc hạ mức lãi suất cho nhà đầu tư cấp dưới, ăn chênh lệch từ phần lãi Phương đưa ra. Tuy nhiên, khi hoạt động kinh doanh bắt đầu thua lỗ, không tiêu thụ được hàng hóa, Phương mất khả năng thanh toán. Để tiếp tục duy trì dòng tiền, Phương lập các đơn hàng giả với mức lãi cao nhằm lôi kéo người mới góp vốn, thực chất là chiếm đoạt tài sản. Từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, Phương đã huy động vốn qua 1.158 đơn hàng, thu về tổng cộng 505,16 tỷ đồng, đã tất toán 990 đơn với lãi suất hơn 91,39 tỷ đồng. Còn lại 168 đơn chưa tất toán, tương đương 112,3 tỷ đồng. Sau khi trừ lãi đã trả, số tiền chiếm đoạt thực tế là 20,3 tỷ đồng, được Phương sử dụng vào các mục đích cá nhân như thuê nhà, kho bãi, vận chuyển hàng hóa, xoay vòng vốn và tiêu xài. Ngày 12/4/2022, Phương chính thức tuyên bố mất khả năng thanh toán. Cùng thời gian này, vợ chồng Long và Trinh sử dụng tiền cá nhân, tiền người thân và nhà đầu tư để góp vốn cho Phương. Đáng chú ý, ngay trong ngày 12/4/2022 – thời điểm Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ, Phương vẫn gửi 12 đơn hàng với lãi suất từ 6% đến 25% cho Long và Trinh nhằm tiếp tục huy động vốn. Ba nhà đầu tư gồm anh Nguyễn Tiến Phương góp 500 triệu đồng, chị Ngô Thị Diệu Lý góp 850 triệu đồng và anh Trần Hùng góp 794 triệu đồng. Vài giờ sau, Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ. Vợ chồng Long – Trinh chỉ hoàn trả cho anh Trần Hùng, không thông báo gì đến chị Lý và anh Phương, cũng không hoàn lại số tiền 1,35 tỷ đồng đã chiếm đoạt để sử dụng vào mục đích cá nhân. Hội đồng xét xử tuyên phạt Lê Thị Hồng Phương 14 năm tù, Phạm Thanh Long bị tuyên phạt 5 năm tù, còn Nguyễn Thu Trinh lĩnh mức án 3 năm 6 tháng tù. Ảnh: Công lý Sau khi Phương mất khả năng thanh toán, Long và Trinh bán căn nhà tại số 4/8 Phạm Ngọc Thạch (phường An Đông, TP. Huế) với giá 4,3 tỷ đồng để trả nợ cho người thân, song vẫn không hoàn trả khoản tiền 1,35 tỷ đồng cho chị Lý và anh Phương. Tại phiên tòa, các bị cáo thừa nhận toàn bộ hành vi phạm tội, thành khẩn khai báo, thể hiện sự ăn năn hối cải và xin được hưởng mức án nhẹ. Sau khi nghị án, HĐXX tuyên mức án như đã nêu. >> Chính thức tuyên phạt vợ chồng ông chủ một tiệm vàng 27 năm tù"

n1gcijj,2025-07-05 11:19:38,en,REDDIT,"  Older Mulberry bags look very outdated and somewhat cheap (anything from the 90s or earlier), and the brand doesn't have the design history or credentials of other labels. While brands like LV (1854), Goyard (1792) and Delvaux (1829) can count their history in centuries now (and ofter were the official supplier to the crown/royalty of their given country of origin), Mulberry was founded in 1971. Their founder is still alive and well, and they didn't even really have an hit bag until the 2000s. Contrast that with things like LV literally creating the first flat topped luggage or engineering the first use of coated canvas, or Chanel creating the first bag with an actual shoulder strap, and therefore influencing the actual design form of all bags ever after, Mulberry does not have that sort of cultural cache. Is there anything that they were the first to do? Also, Mulberry has a huge marketing budget. I've got the coffee table book to prove it (or the fact that 2 of their 3 hit bags are named for and marketed by celebrity influencers: Alexa Chung and Lana Del Rey)."

French fashion, known for its sophisticated simplicity, enchants the world with its versatility. From the iconic trench coat to check here the flamboyant handbag, French style celebrates a certain je ne sais quoi that is both sophisticated and casual. - To appreciate French fashion, one must consider its history. - The fashion capital serves as the playground for this cultural phenomenon. - Iconic brands like Chanel, Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent have defined the global landscape of fashion. Should you desire to emulate this celebrated aesthetic, this journey will unveil the secrets behind French style. Exploring the World Through ""This"" - Language Immersion Language immersion is a experience that intensely submerges you in a new language. Through active engagement, you learn the nuances of a foreign language by enveloping yourself in its society. This can include living in a country where the desired language is used, attending immersion schools, or even engaging in online communities. - Entrapment gifts a exceptional opportunity to acquire a language at a more profound level than traditional academic settings allow. - With communicating with native speakers, you develop your speaking skills and attain a genuine understanding of the traditions associated with the vocabulary. As you envelop yourself in a new dialect, you discover a wealth of thoughts and narratives. The Art of Conversation: Mastering ""Comme"" in Everyday French Embark on a journey through the fascinating world of everyday French conversation by mastering the versatile word ""comme""|as. This seemingly simple preposition holds powerful potential, allowing you to express comparisons, similarities, and even fine points with ease. From painting a picture of your favorite meal to conveying your feelings about the weather, ""comme""|such as becomes an essential tool in your conversational repertoire. - Alright then explore a few useful ways to incorporate ""comme""|as into your daily French interactions. 4. Comme des Garçons: Deconstructing Haute Couture Comme des Garçons, established by Rei Kawakubo, stands as a paradoxical force within the realm of fashion. The label consistently challenges traditional notions of beauty and design, juxtaposing elegance with unpredictability. Kawakubo's distinctive aesthetic often involves deconstructing iconic garments, reimagining them into fragmented and unconventional silhouettes. Her collections frequently feature a bold palette of black, white, and gray, punctuated by occasional bursts of vibrant hues. This deliberate use of minimalism serves to emphasize the architectural and tactile qualities of her creations. Through a series of carefully curated presentations, Kawakubo communicates complex themes that often explore humanity. Her runway shows are not merely fashion displays; they are stirring performances that challenge viewers to question their own perceptions of beauty, normality, and the role of fashion in society. Celebrating Imperfection in Life and Design In a world that often prizes flawlessness, it's easy to get caught up in the pursuit of something unattainable. But what if we shifted our perspective? What if we embraced the inherent variations that make life and design so unique? - That - mindset recognizes that beauty can be found in the unconventional. Think about a hand-painted ceramic mug with a slightly wonky handle or a vintage dress with a few patches. These characteristics don't detract from their beauty; instead, they whisper a story of time. At its core, ""comme ça"" is about celebrating the messiness of life and design. It's about finding joy in the ordinary. 6. The Cultural Significance of ""Comme"" in Francophone Society Within the diverse tapestry of Francophone culture, the seemingly simple word ""comme"" assumes a surprisingly complex role. Far exceeding its literal meaning of ""like"" or ""as,"" it serves as a linguistic chameleon, effortlessly adapting to convey nuances of comparison and even shaping social interactions. From its subtle presence in casual conversations to its more pronounced impact on formal discourse, ""comme"" reveals itself as a fundamental building block of Francophone communication.

FICO, la société de notation de crédit utilisée par la plupart des prêteurs américains, annoncé le 23 juin qu'ils incluraient les prêts BNPL, qui jouent «un rôle de plus en plus important dans la vie financière des consommateurs», pour aider les prêteurs à «évaluer plus précisément la préparation au crédit». Pour les utilisateurs d'entreprises comme Affirmer, Après que et Clairle nouveau calcul pourrait leur profiter car il leur permet de construire leur crédit – si, bien sûr, ils remboursent les prêts à temps, selon les experts. Nitta a d'abord utilisé le BNPL pour les éléments essentiels en 2021, comme les aliments non périssables. Elle était sans travail et «vivant essentiellement par économie», a-t-elle déclaré. Maintenant, travaillant en tant que directeur de bureau pour une pratique de thérapie privée et étudiant le mariage et la thérapie familiale, Nitta est plus stable financièrement mais a une dette de prêt étudiant importante. Depuis, elle a utilisé le BNPL pour les cadeaux de Noël et la vaisselle lorsqu'elle a emménagé dans un nouvel appartement, mais a dit qu'elle effectuait toujours ses paiements à temps. Ted Rossman, analyste principal de l'industrie au site financier Bankrate, a déclaré: «Si vous utilisez l'achat maintenant, payez plus tard de manière responsable», comme Nitta, «je dirais [the change] Devrait vous aider en tant que Steppingstone pour améliorer votre crédit, et peut-être que cela vous aide à obtenir votre premier prêt de carte de crédit ou de voiture. “L'inconvénient principal est que si cela vous me diminue parce que vous payez en retard ou que vous accumulez trop de dettes. Je dirais que c'est une conséquence juste, parce que c'est ce qui se passe sur les cartes de crédit et autres produits”, a-t-il ajouté. Des sociétés comme Affirm, Afterpay et Klarna ont été fondées il y a plus de dix ans, mais leur utilisation s'est considérablement développée pendant la pandémie Covid-19. Ces sociétés ont accordé 180 millions de dollars en prêts totalisant plus de 24 milliards de dollars en 2021, une augmentation de près de dix fois par rapport à 2019, selon le Bureau de protection financière des consommateurs. Fumiko Hayashi, vice-président de la Federal Reserve Bank de Kansas City qui mène des recherches économiques sur les paiements, a noté que le changement était dû à un passage de l'achat dans les magasins à l'achat en ligne – en plus d'un ralentissement économique pendant la pandémie. UN prêt BNPL typique Permet aux consommateurs de diviser un achat de 50 $ à 1 000 $ en quatre versements sans intérêt. Si un emprunteur ne fait pas les paiements requis, le prêteur leur facture des frais de retard. Les prêteurs facturent également des frais de transaction aux commerçants. BNPL est le plus populaire parmi les personnes âgées de 33 ans et moins, qui représentaient 70% des emprunteurs de ces prêts en 2022, selon Le Bureau de la protection financière. Hayashi a noté qu'un inconvénient pour les jeunes utilisateurs est «s'ils continuent d'utiliser le BNPL uniquement et qu'ils n'utilisent pas du tout de carte de crédit, ils ne peuvent pas construire des antécédents de crédit». Avec le changement de FICO, l'utilisation de BNPL pourrait être bénéfique pour certains utilisateurs plus jeunes sans antécédents de crédit – mais moins pour ceux qui ne sont pas aussi responsables. Pour la plupart des utilisateurs, FICO et AFFRAM rapport Sorti en février qui a examiné 500 000 consommateurs. Pourtant, il y a des gens qui pourraient être blessés par le FICO en utilisant les données BNPL. Les personnes ayant des scores de crédit subprime ou subprimaux profonds ont obtenu plus de 60% des nouveaux prêts BNPL de 2021 à 2022, selon Le Bureau de la protection financière. Et 24% des emprunteurs de BNPL étaient en retard à effectuer un paiement en 2024, une augmentation de 6% par rapport à l'année précédente, selon le Réserve fédérale. Parmi les personnes qui gagnent 25 000 $ ou moins, le taux est passé de 31% à 40%. Notamment, l'accès BNPL «réduit considérablement la sensibilité des dépenses par rapport aux revenus», selon un Rapport de la Harvard Business School. “Cet effet est concentré parmi les individus susceptibles d'être limités par la liquidité, en particulier, les utilisateurs à faible revenu et les utilisateurs sans cartes de crédit”, note le rapport. Becca, une travailleuse technologique de 26 ans à New York qui a refusé d'utiliser son nom de famille, a déclaré qu'elle avait utilisé BNPL pour des choses comme des produits de beauté plus chers – y compris un parfum Chanel. Elle a dit qu'elle pourrait «dépenser environ 80 dollars ce mois-ci et effectuer deux paiements séparés de 40 $, puis le mois prochain, je rembourse le reste». Bien que l'option de paiement l'a aidée, elle est préoccupée par des entreprises comme Doordash offrant un BNPL pour les achats mineurs comme un livraison de pizza. “Cela encourage simplement les mauvais comportements de dépenses des jeunes”, a déclaré Becca. “Tous ces articles s'accumulent parce que vous l'utilisez encore et encore et encore. Vous n'avez pas l'impression de dépenser beaucoup d'argent.” Il est peut-être un certain temps avant que l'économie ne ressente l'impact du nouveau calcul de la cote de crédit, a déclaré Rossman. Alors que FICO a déclaré qu'il mettrait les nouveaux scores disponibles à l'automne 2025, La plupart des prêteurs continuent Pour utiliser un modèle de cote de crédit à partir de 2009 (malgré le FICO depuis la publication de nouvelles versions). “Le changement arrive relativement lentement dans le monde du score de crédit, donc même si cela devient disponible à l'automne, cela ne signifie pas que tout le monde va l'utiliser tout de suite”, a déclaré Rossman. «C'est un peu comme votre téléphone. Par exemple, Apple a l'iPhone 16, mais beaucoup de gens utilisent toujours les modèles 15 ou 14 ou même plus anciens. Le score de crédit fonctionne de la même manière.» #Achetez #maintenant #les #prêts #ultérieurs #seront #désormais #affectés #aux #cotes #crédit #américains #questce #cela #signifie #pour #les #consommateurs #Achetez #maintenant #payez #tard 2025-07-05 11"

18082267417839231,2025-07-05 13:49:06,en,INSTAGRAM,"  Know by Name by Channel Miller was not on my TBR. It was added to my list this year by the #beyondthespines reading challenge. I'm so, so glad this book was included on this year's challenge list. It was hard to read - I listened to the audiobook, read by the author - but it was an important read. Know My Name by Chanel Miller is a powerful memoir recounting her 2015 sexual assault by Brock Turner at Stanford University and the subsequent legal battle and personal journey of healing. This was a challenging topic. Miller speaks in depth about her trauma and the impact of the assault also had on her family and friends. She spares no detail in recounting the invasive medical and legal processes faced by victims of sexual assault. She speaks of the emotional toll of the trial - where her identity was hidden behind the name “Emily Doe” - and the devastation at Turner's lenient sentence. The memoir highlights Miller's journey to reclaim her identity and open herself to life during and after the years the assault and legal process stole from her. You likely remember this case or have even read Miller's viral impact statement. This memoir is what happened behind the scenes  and speaks to how one victim's voice has sparked widespread support and advocacy for survivors. This book was equally devastating and inspiring. I'd highly recommend. #booksta #bookstagram #bookstagrammer #memoir #audio #audiobookreview #audiobookreview #channelmiller #knowmyname"

8b75e009087a7260ca6f8dbaae3a6e9c,2025-07-05 16:44:00,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]MILANO - Debutterà in prima assoluta giovedì 10 luglio , evento inaugurale della 62ª edizione de l Festival di Cervo (Imperia), la performance teatrale La forza del desiderio , che vedrà protagonisti lo psicoanalista e scrittore Massimo Recalcati e l ' attrice Elena And reoli . Basato su Amen , il primo testo scritto da Recalcati appositamente per il teatro, lo spettacolo (che verrà replicato il giorno successivo, venerdì 11 luglio, a Saluzzo, in provincia di Cuneo, nell'ambito del festival Borgate dal Vivo ) vede il ritorno sulle scene di Elena Andreoli , che negli anni Novanta ha girato l'Italia calcando i palcoscenici accanto a due mostri sacri come Dario Fo e Franca Rame (insieme alla quale è stata a lungo coprotagonista in L'Eroina e Grasso è bello) e che ha lavorato anche con Carmelo Bene . Nel nuovo lavoro di Recalcati riflessioni e paure sul proprio futuro si intrecciano: che cosa rende possibile la resistenza della vita di fronte alle avversità e alla morte? In Amen l'autore racconta come la forza del desiderio può farci rialzare anche quan d o tutto sembra perduto. Recalcati parla di un'esistenza sul confine tra la vita e la morte, tra battesimo ed estrema unzione. Della nuda fede di una madre verso il battito del cuore del figlio. Di un vecchio soldato, sopravvissuto alla guerra, che insegna la forza del passo nella neve. Sullo sfondo i ricordi di una vita e la presenza incombente della fine. Una preghiera nel nome della vita che non vuole morire. Afferm a Elena Andreoli : «In questo spettacolo interpreterò tutti e tre i personaggi creati da Recalcati. Per una curiosa coincidenza del destino, queste figure mi sono particolarmente familiari. Il primo personaggio, infatti, non può non farmi pensare a mi o nonno materno, che tornò a piedi dalla drammatica campagna di Russia. Rientrato in Italia, diventò uno scrittore umoristico. Aveva fatto dell'ironia un rifugio contro il dolore, un modo per restare vivo, per riuscire a ridere ancora nonostante tutto l'orr o re vissuto. La seconda figura che porterò in scena è quella di una madre che affronta la tragedia di un figlio nato prematuro e già dato per morto ma che resiste, resiste contro ogni previsi o ne. Impossibile non identificarmi in questa donna e non pensare alla bimba che persi, vent'anni fa, quand'ero all'ottavo mese di gravidanza. Il terzo e ultimo pe r sonaggio è proprio il figlio nato prematuro, cioè lo stesso Recalcati, fortunatamente sopravvissuto e diventato il grande psicoanalista che conosciamo e che amiamo. Queste tre figure dialogheranno tra loro in un bellissimo esempio di meta-teatro. La forza del desi derio è un intreccio non solo di monologhi, ma anche di biografie: la mia, quella dell'autore e quelle dei suoi personaggi. Il tutto lungo un percorso artistico che è allo stesso tempo terapeutico: una vera catarsi, come nel grande teatro greco». U n (triplo) ruolo impegnativo, come si vede, che però non spaventa l'attrice milanese: Elena Andreoli, infatti, è capace di passare con disinvoltura dal registro brillante a quello drammatico, dai toni ironici a quelli più intimi e delicati. Merito di u na dura gavetta iniziata negli anni Novanta quando, dopo aver frequentato i corsi all ' Accademia d'Arte Drammatica , alla Royal Shakespeare House di Londra e all' Actor's Studio di Londra , si è avvicinata al teatro, lavorando con personaggi come Dario Fo, Fr anca Rame e Carmelo Bene : «Sono felice di tornare a riannusare il profumo del teatro, l'odore del legno del palcoscenico - dichiara Andreoli - . Dopo le prime prove de La forza del desiderio questo profumo mi è tornato immediatamente familiare. Lo avevo respirato per tanti anni con Memè Perlini, pioniere dell'avanguardia teatrale ngli anni '70 a Roma e grande artista visionario, poi con Dario Fo e Franca Rame e infine con Carmelo Bene». La regia de La forza del desiderio è firmata da Alberto Traverso, mentre Carlos Eduardo Zarattini ha curato il sound design. In scena, accanto a Massimo Recalcati ed Elena Andreoli ci sarà anche il pianista Tony Berchmans , che eseguirà musiche originali composte da lui, Zarattini, Andreoli e Traverso. Dallo spettacolo è stato realizzato un podcast che verrà pubblicato su Spotify e su altre piattaforme digitali: «Nel podcast sono affiancata da due attori, due voci del cinema note e premiate (Simone D'Andrea e Sebastiano Tamburrini), che interpretano, rispettivamente, Recalcati e il soldato - afferma Andreoli - io faccio soltanto il personaggio della madre». Eclettica e versatile, vedremo Elena anche sul grande schermo : in autunno, infatti, uscirà Stella Gemella del regista Luca Lucini , commedia (nel cast figurano come protagoniste Margherita Buy e Laura Morante) in cui Andreoli è una cantan te jazz alle prese con un brano da lei stessa composto. Per il cinema, in passato, Elena ha lavorato con Mario Monicelli al fianco di Philippe Noiret e con Federico Fellini , di cui è stata assistente al doppiaggio ne La voce della Luna . A proposito di doppiaggio: oltre che attrice, Elena è una speaker e doppiatrice di talento, tanto che lo scorso autunno si è aggiudicata il prestigioso Anello d'Oro come miglior voce femminile televisiva dell'anno (sezione programmi tv e d'informazione) p er lo speakeraggio di 4 Hotel , il seguitissimo talent show di Bruno Barbieri in onda su Sky. Il riconoscimento le è stato assegnato dalla giuria di Voci Nell'Ombra , il festival internazionale del doppiaggio. Nel corso della sua brillante carriera l'artista milanese ha prestato, inoltre, la voce al cinema ( La voce senza volto di Filippo Soldi, candidato ai Nastri d'Argento 2024), alla pubblicità (per gli spot Chanel N° 1, Mulino Bianco, Apple, Esselunga, Wolksvagen, Ike a e molti altri) e ai documentari ( Cinema Forever di Alberto Traverso, presentato e proiettato al MoMa di New York). Dal 2022, inoltre, è la voce istituzionale del Corriere.it , la versione online del Corriere della Sera, il più importante quotidiano italia no. Da segnalare, infine, che Elena è anche una sofisticata e brillante cantante jazz: dopo i due sold-out fatti registrare lo scorso anno, sarà di nuovo in concerto nel foyer del Teatro degli Arcimboldi di Milano il prossimo 26 ottobre con il suo sestetto e con il grande clarinettista Paolo Tomelleri nell'ambito del festival internazionale JAZZMI. In questa occasione Andreoli presenterà il su o album d'esordio, che affonda le radici nello swing ed è un'appassionata dichiarazione d'amore per il jazz."

n1il66z,2025-07-05 19:11:56,en,REDDIT,"  Books!!! Great sewing books are inspiring and often priced so they feel like an indulgence. A few I have and love are listed below. If you know she likes / is inspired by a particular designer -- for example, Cocoa Chanel -- that also provides lots of options. A list of some of my favorites, in no particular order: Real Clothes, Real Lives: 200 Years of What Women Wore (Smith College Historic Clothing Collection) by Kiki Smith and Vanessa Friedman [This is a sourcebook of women's clothing through the years with fantastic photos. It focuses on daily wear items, like day dresses aprons, and uniforms -- not evening wear or couture. It's inspiring and makes an excellent coffee table book.] Vintage Details: A Fashion Sourcebook by Jeffrey Mayer and Basia Szkutnicka [Highlights different garment details and categorizes by decade. Great close-up photos of interesting garment details from the outside of the garment. Covers coats, suits, dresses, and other items.] What Shall I Wear: The What, Where, When, and How Much of Fashion by Claire McCardell. New edition has a forward by Tory Burch. [This is a GEM. Claire McCardell was a highly influential American designer who is credited with creating American sportswear. This is her reflection on the role of fashion in a woman's life. it's lovely. If not a gift for her birthday, perhaps a sweet just-because gift some time. As a quick note: It was written in 1957 and a few sentences come off as a bit dated by today's standards. However, IMO, it doesn't distract.] Ann Lowe: American Couturier by Elizabeth Way and Heather Hodge. [Ann Lowe was a gown designer and seamstress who designed Jacqueline Kennedy's wedding dress and bridesmaid dresses, as well as gowns for many other famous and influential people. She was a black woman who designed for white women and received little credit in her lifetime. Her story is just staring to be known. This is a coffee table sized book with lots of photos -- including some really helpful inner construction photos -- and Ann's story. I believe it  was created to accompany a retrospective museum exhibit.] I hope this helps!!"

El desfile ha sido convocado por Federación Estatal de Lesbianas, Gais, Trans, Bisexuales, Intersexuales y más (FELGTBI+) y Colectivo LGTBI de Madrid (COGAM), bajo el lema '20 años avanzando en derechos: Ni un paso atrás'. De manera puntual, a las 19 horas, la marcha ha dado comienzo desde Atocha, para seguir su paso por el Paseo del Prado, Cibeles y Paseo de Recoletos, hasta llegar a la plaza de Colón, donde se ha leído el manifiesto. Este año, en la cabecera de la manifestación solo han estado presentes dos ministras del Gobierno: la vicepresidenta segunda y ministra de Trabajo y Economía Social, Yolanda Díaz, y la ministra de Sanidad, Mónica García. PUBLICIDAD La gran ausente ha sido la ministra de Igualdad, Ana Redondo, que no ha acudido a la marcha. Junto a ellos han marchado los convocantes, entre los que destacan la presidenta de la Federación Estatal LGTBI+ (FELGTB), Paula Iglesias, y el presidente de COGAM, Ronny de la Cruz. Durante la lectura del manifiesto, los representantes organizadores han avisado de que se está viviendo un ""retroceso global en derechos"". ""Vemos cómo el odio se disfraza de libertad de expresión, cómo se atacan nuestras infancias, nuestras familias, nuestras identidades"", han lamentado. ""Se nos ridiculiza, se nos censura, se nos invalida, se nos niega nuestra identidad. Desde tribunas políticas, desde platós de televisión, desde cuentas anónimas en redes sociales. Se cuestiona nuestra existencia con una impunidad que duele. Pero no nos vamos a esconder. No vamos a volver atrás"", han apostillado. PUBLICIDAD Entre las reclamaciones de este año han destacado el reconocimiento automático de la filiación en las parejas de mujeres, la protección y regularización de las personas trans migrantes, y sanciones efectivas a quienes discriminen a las personas LGTBI+. En total, la manifestación de hoy ha contado con 47 carrozas, entre las que han destacado las de los cantantes Manuel Turizo y Karol G, encargada de cerrar un desfile que ha recorrido las arterias principales de la capital al ritmo de 'A quién le importa' de Alaska, 'SloMo' de Chanel, o 'Zorra' de Nebulossa. El acto ha finalizado con una gran fiesta en la Plaza de Colón que, junto con otros escenarios repartidos por toda la ciudad, pondrán el broche final a esta semana de celebración."

n1kcjeb,2025-07-06 01:28:49,en,REDDIT,"  Old Favs: I've been leaning into Summer colors, and blues are a particular favorite of mine. I broke out my Sailor Moon palettes from Colourpop yesterday and tried to do a cute little periwinkle + peach sky vibe. It turned out alright! Adding Chanel's Beige Lumiere gave it some much needed light. Colourpop does do pastels pretty well, but I did make sure to wear MAC's eye primer. New Favs: Guerlain's Emerald Feathers palette -- I just couldn't resist, and omg. If you were thinking of getting Lisa Eldridge's vs this one, I'd go for Guerlain's, BUT the green is more intense in Guerlain's vs LE's true khaki, plus you have a little more options with LE. Still, this made the green / gold in my brown eyes pop! I had 1 person tell me I looked great, and my Door Dash driver was flirting with me, lol! Idk if it was the eyeshadow but woo. Lancome's Juicy Tube in Lavender Latte -- I think this is beautiful and with that peachy-blue look I mentioned, I paired this over top of Romand's Juicy Lasting Tint in Mulled Peach. I was an OG fan of these back in the day, so I knew I'd grab one eventually. I will say I do not like the floral taste of this. It has a fruity scent, but a floral taste. No matter how I try, I can't get into flowers in tea, vape juice, food, and now makeup. They don't belong in my mouth, lol. After a bit you don't notice it though, and these do adhere well because they're a little sticky, but in the right way, not the uncomfy kind. Fenty's Smurfette Gloss Bomb -- This is PURPLE, and the sparkles in this are way more intense than Lancome's. Also adheres well, but does feel heavy. Not a good thing to apply before bed because my lips felt gross in the morning, lol! It's really cute though and... Smurfette <3 Weird collab but I likey. Mid: The Saem's Jelly Blusher in Dusty Vine -- I love a dusty purple blush, and they are hard to find, since most go pink or disappear to nothing. This almost disappears to nothing. It's extremely faint. Worked great with my eyeshadow for a crease shade on that peachy-blue look, but primer is probs what made it pop out. You can build it, but it takes a lot. Nice for subtle dusty purple I suppose. Idk, I've never been impressed with any of The Saem's color products. Reminds of drug store I'd buy 15 years ago. Their under-eye concealer is insanely good though. Edit: And it's not a jelly. It's a matte powder. No shine. Idk what's up with the name, lol."

Comme des Garçons: Deconstructing Haute Couture Comme des Garçons, founded by Rei Kawakubo, stands as a paradoxical force within the realm of fashion. The label consistently challenges traditional notions of beauty and design, juxtaposing elegance with unpredictability. Kawakubo's signature aesthetic often involves deconstructing classic garments, transforming them into fragmented and unconventional silhouettes. Her collections frequently feature a stark palette of black, white, and gray, punctuated by occasional bursts of vibrant shades. This deliberate use of minimalism serves to highlight the architectural and tactile qualities of her creations. Through a series of carefully curated presentations, Kawakubo communicates complex themes that often explore humanity. Her runway shows are not merely fashion displays; they are provocative performances that challenge viewers to reconsider their own perceptions of beauty, normality, and the role of fashion in society. Cultivating Imperfection in Life and Design In a world that often prizes perfection, it's easy to get caught up in the pursuit of something unattainable. But what if we altered our perspective? What if we welcomed the inherent imperfections that make life and design so intriguing? - That - approach recognizes that charm can be found in the unconventional. Consider about a hand-painted ceramic mug with a slightly wonky handle or a vintage dress with a few details. These flaws don't detract from their beauty; instead, they tell a story of experience. In essence, ""comme ça"" is about accepting the complexity of Comme life and design. It's about apprehending grace in the unexpected. 6. The Cultural Significance of ""Comme"" in Francophone Society Within the diverse tapestry of Francophone culture, the seemingly simple word ""comme"" assumes a surprisingly complex role. Far exceeding its literal meaning of ""like"" or ""as,"" it serves as a linguistic chameleon, effortlessly adapting to convey nuances of comparison and even shaping social interactions. From its subtle presence in casual conversations to its more pronounced impact on formal discourse, ""comme"" reveals itself as a fundamental building block of Francophone communication. Consequently, understanding the multifaceted significance of this word unlocks a deeper appreciation for the richness and complexity of the Francophone world."

🇫🇷
酒店在巴黎8区，购物超级超级超级方便！ 蒙田大道就在后面，下楼就到。 位置真的绝佳， 蒙田很好逛，LV，Chanel，BV，Dior都有很大的boutique，货也蛮全的。 如果购物住几天等调货去拿或者送到酒店都OK。 走到香街大概也就10分多钟吧，离乔治五世的Hermes也很近，巴黎一共就3家Hermes，方便拿包。 🍊
离橘园美术馆很近（巴黎我最喜欢的美术馆之一），不到1.5公里，杜乐丽花园也在附近。 走到铁塔大概15分钟。 大部分购物的地方都在附近可以解决，完全不用担心交通，走路都能到。 远一点的出行基本靠Uber，很便捷。 需要早点预定哦。 🗼
最重要的就是选房型啦。 我定的是“Deluxe Double Room with Eiffel Tower View”。 阳台就能很清楚的看到铁塔，合影真是绝了，哈哈。 我后来还换了酒店，很复古很巴黎的一家，之后和大家分享~坦白讲还是这家房间大了很多，而且各方面都很不错，购物实在是很方便。 所以我觉得性价比还是蛮高的。 🤵🏻
服务很好~~很贴心，reception的小哥又帅又热情。 有一万下雨了，我们买了超多东西，帮我们提下车的，后来换酒店好几个大箱子也都帮我们搬上车，特别好。 另一家酒店就毫无服务可言😓
🛁
备品用的是法国贵妇小众护肤品牌CODAGE，味道很好闻~设备都很齐全，早餐也很不错。 ❤️

FICO, la compañía de puntuación crediticia utilizada por la mayoría de los prestamistas estadounidenses, anunciado el 23 de junio que incluirían préstamos BNPL, que juegan “un papel cada vez más importante en la vida financiera de los consumidores”, para ayudar a los prestamistas a “evaluar con precisión la preparación crediticia”. Para usuarios de empresas como Afirmar, Después de la entrada y Claroel nuevo cálculo podría beneficiarlos porque les permite desarrollar su crédito; si, por supuesto, pagan los préstamos a tiempo, dicen los expertos. Nitta usó por primera vez BNPL para elementos esenciales en 2021, como alimentos no perecederos. Estaba sin trabajo y “básicamente viviendo de ahorros”, dijo. Ahora, trabajando como gerente de oficina para una práctica de terapia privada y estudiando la terapia matrimonial y familiar, Nitta es más estable financieramente, pero tiene una deuda significativa de préstamos estudiantiles. Desde entonces, ha usado BNPL para regalos de Navidad y vajilla cuando se mudó a un nuevo apartamento, pero dijo que siempre hace sus pagos a tiempo. Ted Rossman, analista de la industria senior en el sitio financiero Bankrate, dice: “Si está utilizando la compra ahora, pague más tarde de manera responsable”, como Nitta, “Argumentaría [the change] Debería ayudarlo como un pelaje para mejorar su crédito, y tal vez le ayude a obtener su primera tarjeta de crédito o préstamo para automóvil. “El principal inconveniente es si te cae porque estás pagando tarde o acumulando demasiada deuda. Diría que es una consecuencia justa, porque eso es lo que sucede en tarjetas de crédito y otros productos”, agregó. Empresas como Affirm, Afterpay y Klarna se fundaron hace más de una década, pero su uso se expandió significativamente durante la pandemia Covid-19. Estas compañías proporcionaron $ 180 millones en préstamos por un total de más de $ 24 mil millones en 2021, un aumento de casi diez veces con respecto a 2019, según el Oficina de Protección Financiera del Consumidor. Fumiko Hayashi, vicepresidente del Banco de la Reserva Federal de la Ciudad de Kansas, que realiza investigaciones económicas sobre pagos, señaló que el cambio se debió a un cambio de compras en las tiendas a comprar en línea, además de una recesión económica durante la pandemia. A préstamo BNPL típico Permite a los consumidores dividir una compra de $ 50 a $ 1,000 en cuatro cuotas sin intereses. Si un prestatario no realiza los pagos requeridos, entonces el prestamista les cobra una tarifa atrasada. Los prestamistas también cobran tarifas de transacción a los comerciantes. BNPL es más popular entre las personas de 33 años o menos, que representaban el 70% de los prestatarios de dichos préstamos en 2022, según la Oficina de Protección Financiera. Hayashi señaló que un inconveniente para los usuarios más jóvenes es “si siguen usando solo BNPL y no usan una tarjeta de crédito en absoluto, no pueden construir un historial de crédito”. Con el cambio de FICO, el uso de BNPL de manera responsable podría ser beneficioso para algunos usuarios más jóvenes sin antecedentes crediticios previos, pero menos para aquellos que no son tan responsables. Para la mayoría de los usuarios, dicen FICO y Affirm, incluidos los datos de BNPL en informes de crédito produjeron puntajes más altos o cambios de puntaje, un hallazgo en un año de duración de un año informe Lanzado en febrero que analizó a 500,000 consumidores. Aún así, hay personas que podrían ser lastimadas por FICO usando datos BNPL. Las personas con puntajes de crédito subprime o subprime profundos obtuvieron más del 60% de los nuevos préstamos BNPL de 2021 a 2022, según la Oficina de Protección Financiera. Y el 24% de los prestatarios de BNPL llegaron tarde al pago en 2024, un aumento del 6% con respecto al año anterior, según el Reserva federal. Entre las personas que ganan $ 25,000 o menos, la tasa aumentó del 31% al 40%. En particular, el acceso a BNPL “reduce significativamente la sensibilidad del gasto en relación con los ingresos”, según un Informe de Harvard Business School. “Este efecto se concentra entre las personas que probablemente sean limitadas, específicamente, usuarios y usuarios de bajos ingresos sin tarjetas de crédito”, señala el informe. Becca, una trabajadora tecnológica de 26 años en Nueva York que se negó a usar su apellido, dijo que usó BNPL para cosas como productos de belleza más caros, incluido un perfume Chanel. Ella dijo que podría “gastar como 80 dólares este mes en él y hacer dos pagos separados de $ 40, y luego el próximo mes, pago el resto”. Si bien la opción de pago la ha ayudado, le preocupa compañías como Doordash que ofrecen BNPL para compras menores como un entrega de pizza. “Es solo alentar el mal comportamiento del gasto de los jóvenes”, dijo Becca. “Todos estos artículos se acumulan porque lo estás usando una y otra vez. No sientes que estás gastando mucho dinero”. Puede pasar algún tiempo antes de que la economía sienta el impacto del nuevo cálculo del puntaje de crédito, dijo Rossman. Mientras FICO declaró que pondría los nuevos puntajes disponibles en el otoño de 2025, La mayoría de los prestamistas continúan para usar un modelo de puntaje de crédito de 2009 (a pesar de FICO desde que lanzó nuevas versiones). “El cambio se produce relativamente lentamente en el mundo de la puntuación crediticia, por lo que incluso si esto está disponible en el otoño, eso no significa que todos lo usen de inmediato”, dijo Rossman. “Es como su teléfono. Por ejemplo, Apple tiene el iPhone 16, pero mucha gente todavía está usando los 15 o los 14 o incluso los modelos más antiguos. La puntuación crediticia funciona de la misma manera”. 2025-07-05 13:00:00 Compre ahora pagar préstamos posteriores ahora afectará los puntajes crédito los Estados Unidos qué significa eso para los consumidores Comprar ahora pagar más tarde,"

2283b736d96ed37a9c6502b279fd4568,2025-07-06 10:11:00,en,WEB,"  I'm excited to write about this topic because it's not only fascinating but also enlightening and empowering. As a wealth enthusiast who didn't come from money, I genuinely want to understand how wealthy people think and operate. If you want to build generational wealth, you can't just focus on making money; you have to learn how to think like money. And the best teachers aren't the newly rich people flexing on social media or the entrepreneurs bragging about their latest deals. The best teachers are women with the mindset that preserves wealth across generations. They understand the unspoken rules, quiet codes, and subtle behaviors that separate old money from new money. And if you're interested in building wealth from scratch like I am, studying how they move through the world is like getting a masterclass in financial psychology. Here's what you'll never see truly wealthy women do in public: 8 Things Truly Wealthy Women Never Do in Public 1. They Never Talk About Money or How Much Things Cost One of the best books I've read on finance, and one I still plan to read again, is “ The Rules of Wealth ” by Richard Templar. The 4th rule of wealth he mentioned is keeping things under your hat. See the pictures below to view my highlights: Let me tell you, wealthy women have turned this into an art form. They don't discuss money in public because they don't need to. You'll never hear them bragging about how much they spent on something or complaining about how expensive things are. They don't name-drop prices or make their financial decisions everyone else's business. When someone compliments their handbag, they say “thank you,” not “Thanks, it was three thousand dollars.” I did something similar once, and I was instantly ashamed of myself. Lol. Because talking about money, whether you're bragging about having it or complaining about not having enough, makes everyone at the table do mental math about their own finances. And nobody wants to be the person who makes the entire room uncomfortable by mentioning that their handbag costs more than someone's monthly rent. Rich women also understand that money conversations are never actually about money. They're about power, status, and making other people feel a certain way. When you announce prices, you're either trying to impress people, or you're unconsciously making them feel bad about their choices. Neither is a good look. Also, there's something almost sacred about money in certain circles. The same way you wouldn't discuss your medical procedures over appetizers, wealthy women treat financial details as private information that doesn't belong in casual conversation. They've learned that the moment you start talking numbers, you stop being seen as a person and start being seen as a bank account. Wealthy women would rather be known for their character, their intelligence, or their contributions than for their ability to spend money. The people who need to know about your wealth already do. And the people who don't need to know don't need to be told. 2. They Never Wear Everything Expensive at Once Yes, you have the money and can afford to buy the nicest things, but drowning yourself in logos isn't the flex you think it is. Some women walk into events looking like a designer store has exploded on them; a Gucci bag, Chanel shoes, Hermès scarf, Cartier watch, and a Louis Vuitton belt, all at the same time. And every wealthy woman in the room immediately knows they're trying too hard because it's giving “I just got money, and I need everyone to know it” energy. Actual rich women dress as if they had forgotten they were rich. They'll wear a $3,000 sweater that looks like it came from nowhere special, paired with jeans that fit perfectly and shoes that are comfortable enough to wear all day. The only people who recognize the quality are other people who can afford the same things. It's like speaking in code: if you know, you know. If you're wearing every expensive thing you own at once, you're basically screaming, “I'M RICH,” in a room full of people who prefer to whisper about their wealth. Wealthy women don't scream; they whisper. They save the dramatic displays for people who need to be impressed by logos, which definitely isn't other wealthy people. 3. They Never Take Photos of Their Food, Expensive Purchases, or Hotel Rooms For Validation Okay, this is quite controversial because we are in the creator economy, and everyone wants to share their world and experience with the world for various reasons. It's easier to build a personal brand when you have pretty pictures of yourself wearing nice things and being in fancy places to share. Content creation is a legitimate business, and lifestyle content sells. Aside from that, it's just fun to create and share. For instance, I enjoy watching Temi Otedola , the youngest daughter of Femi Otedola , one of the richest men in Africa...."

Ore, giorni, mesi immersa in un lavoro fatto con dedizione e passione. Un progetto impegnativo perché ha inglobato non solo la fase di scrittura ma anche quella dell'illustrazione e ora si aggiunge anche la trepidazione dell'attesa di avere dei riscontri da parte dei lettori. Perché quando si pubblica qualcosa, anche un semplice post, ci si espone al giudizio degli altri e, quindi, si diventa vulnerabili.

E lo consiglio anche agli uomini che vogliono donare questo libro alle Poppy Spring che hanno intorno. Anche qui Poppy condivide le sue esperienze, sempre con ironia, da sola, con gli amici, con la famiglia.

mov_BF4C9DBB5B1B53D4857E0B2EF2044746,2025-07-06 12:00:18,id,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[id]Liputan6.com, Jakarta - Sebuah studi yang diterbitkan pada 23 Juni 2025 oleh organisasi nonpemerintah Inggris Earthsight menyebut bahwa merek-merek fesyen mewah internasional membeli kulit dari perusahaan-perusahaan yang terkait dengan peternakan yang memelihara sapi di tanah adat dan di daerah-daerah yang ditebangi secara ilegal di Amazon. Melansir Brasil de Fato, Sabtu (5/7/2025), investigasi yang dilakukan dalam kemitraan dengan Repórter Brasil ini menganalisis keputusan pengadilan, citra satelit, dan catatan pengiriman. Laporan ini juga meneliti rantai pasar di sektor tersebut untuk mengungkap jaringan pasokan kulit dari merek-merek, seperti Chanel, Balenciaga, dan Gucci. Menurut Earthsight, perusahaan pengepakan daging Brasil Frigol berada di dasar rantai produksi ini. Rumah pemotongan hewan tersebut diidentifikasi sebagai pembeli sapi yang dipelihara di tanah yang diembargo karena penebangan hutan, serta dari peternakan yang didirikan secara ilegal di Tanah Adat Apyterewa di São Félix do Xingu, negara bagian Pará. Studi tersebut menunjukkan bahwa hampir semua kulit yang diekspor dari Pará ke Eropa ditujukan ke Italia. Sebagian dari produk ini dibeli Conceria Cristina dan Faeda, perusahaan penyamakan kulit dari Veneto, Italia, tempat bahan tersebut diproses dan diberi merek baru sebagai ""kulit Italia."" Perusahaan-perusahaan ini memasok lusinan merek fesyen, otomotif, dan desain interior mewah. Selain Chanel, Balenciaga, dan Gucci, Conceria Cristina memasok kulit yang diperoleh di Brasil ke merek mewah Amerika Serikat (AS), Coach, yang menargetkan Generasi Z dan menjual tas dengan harga antara 340─686 dolar AS (sekitar Rp5,5 juta─Rp11,1 juta), yang dianggap ""mudah dijangkau"" di pasar barang mewah. Hubungan komersial antara Coach dan Conceria Cristina dikonfirmasi pada peneliti Earthsight oleh juru bicara dari perusahaan penyamakan kulit Italia. Investigasi tersebut menyoroti Durlicouros, eksportir terbesar dari Pará ke Eropa, sebagai pemasok utama bagi perusahaan-perusahaan Italia. Menurut laporan ekspor yang dianalisis Earthsight, Durlicouros telah mengekspor 90 persen dari semua kulit yang diproduksi di Pará ke Italia dari 2020 hingga 2023, dengan total 14.700 ton. Durlicouros mengonfirmasi pada Earthsight bahwa mereka membeli kulit binatang dari Frigol. Frigol adalah salah satu dari lima perusahaan pengemasan daging terbesar di Brasil, dengan kapasitas untuk menyembelih 2.400 ekor sapi per hari di fasilitasnya di Pará, menurut studi Earthsight. Pada Oktober 2024, Institut Lingkungan Hidup dan Sumber Daya Alam Terbarukan Brasil (IBAMA) mendenda Frigol dan perusahaan pengemasan daging lain karena membeli 18 ribu ekor sapi yang dibesarkan di kawasan hutan Amazon yang gundul di negara bagian Pará dan Amazonas. Investigasi Earthsight memperoleh dokumen yang, menurut LSM tersebut, menunjukkan bahwa Frigol membeli 3.643 ekor sapi yang dibesarkan secara ilegal di dua wilayah yang diembargo di sebuah peternakan di São Félix do Xingu pada 2019. Perusahaan tersebut didenda hampir 360 ribu dolar AS karena memperoleh hewan dari wilayah yang diembargo di mana pemeliharaan sapi dilarang. Kendati demikian, menurut LSM Inggris tersebut, antara Januari 2020 hingga Oktober 2023, Frigol tetap membeli ternak dari lokasi yang wilayahnya diembargo. Earthsight menganalisis citra satelit untuk membuktikan bahwa tidak ada cukup waktu untuk pemulihan wilayah yang ditebang secara ilegal tersebut. Menanggapi Earthsight, Frigol menyatakan bahwa pihaknya belum mengidentifikasi kejanggalan apapun di antara para pemasok yang dituduh membeli ternak yang dibesarkan di Tanah Adat Apyterewa. Perusahaan tersebut juga menegaskan bahwa kebijakan pembeliannya sejalan dengan ""Boi na Linha,"" protokol pemantauan untuk pembelian ternak yang dikembangkan LSM Imaflora dalam kemitraan dengan MPF. Menurut Frigol, 100 persen ternak yang dibeli dari pemasok langsungnya dibesarkan sesuai kriteria sosial-lingkungan. Perusahaan tersebut juga mengklaim dapat memantau pemasok tidak langsungnya di tingkat pertama. Dalam pernyataan yang dikirim ke Repórter Brasil, perusahaan pengemasan daging tersebut menekankan bahwa pihaknya ""mengklarifikasi secara terperinci setiap hipotesis yang disajikan"" dalam laporan Earthsight, ""yang menunjukkan bahwa semua pembelian sesuai sosial-lingkungan."" Frigol menyoroti komitmennya terhadap Perjanjian Penyesuaian Perilaku untuk Peternakan Sapi Berkelanjutan di Negara Bagian Pará (TAC da carne). Perjanjian ini, yang ditetapkan pada 2009, mengharuskan perusahaan pengemasan daging berkomitmen tidak memperoleh ternak dari daerah yang ditebangi secara ilegal di Amazon setelah tahun 2008."

mov_27BE02CBCEF34829295F83084B026868,2025-07-06 16:29:20,en,WEB,"  After a year of musical chairs in fashion, September is gearing up to be one of its biggest show months ever: with debut collections slated from new creative directors at brands including Matthieu Blazy at Chanel and ex-Balenciaga designer Demna at Gucci. On Sunday in Paris, Michael Rider, who recently succeeded Hedi Slimane at Celine, decided to get a head start. Acting as a sort of amuse bouche for how he plans to shape the brand's future, Rider showed a mixture of men's and womenswear. The show took place at the brand's sprawling atelier, a short hop from the Tuileries Garden. Guests included the actor Naomi Watts and, fresh from 18 months of South Korean military service, Kim Taehyung, from the K-pop band BTS, who attempted to shelter from the rain under a giant silk foulard that had been erected above a courtyard. It was a full-circle moment for Rider, an American designer who previously worked under Phoebe Philo during her tenure at the brand from 2008 to 2017. While fans of her work, known as “Philophiles”, had hoped Rider would reinstate that era of louche tailoring and minimalism, his opening looks quickly curtailed such expectations. Instead of oversized silhouettes, there was a series of skinny jeans and even skinner trousers, hugging calves so tightly, they should have come with a circulation warning. These lean silhouettes were a nod to his predecessor, Slimane, who honed his signature sharp-edged style during his stints at Saint Laurent and Dior Homme before introducing it to Celine. Despite initial criticism, Slimane proved lucrative for Celine's parent company LVMH. According to analysts, he was estimated to have doubled Celine's annual sales to €2.5bn (£2.1bn), transforming it into LVMH's third-largest brand, sitting behind Louis Vuitton and Dior. However, in October, he resigned with rumours of failed contract negotiations to blame. It's now up to Rider to pick up that moneyed baton. Rider's appointment comes at a difficult time in the fashion industry, with a significant slowdown across luxury markets (for the first quarter of 2025, LVMH reported a 4% sales drop across fashion and leather goods). At the annual general meeting in April 2024, LVMH's chief executive, Bernard Arnault, said: “Celine is chic, hip, sexy fashion for young people even if the prices are what they are, and it works.” Rather than wiping the slate clean, during this period of uncertainty, it appears that Rider is set on evolving on the brand's existing tried and tested formula. Speaking backstage after the show, Rider said he “did not want there to be a sense of erasure”, adding that “there was a foundation to build on. That to me felt modern, it felt ethical, it felt strong.” Rider balanced this homage to the past by intertwining it with his own fashion story. There were nods to his American roots and recent stint as design director of Polo Ralph Lauren, with punchy, coloured knitted V-neck jumpers, neat Oxford shirts and striped ties. Simple evening looks in black including an off-the-shoulder dress and satin lapelled blazers seemed to subtly recall his previous time at Celine. Accessories, which are easier for luxury brands to shift than a £5k coat, were a focus. Models' fingers came covered in multiple gold and primary coloured rings. Chunky bangles were stacked on forearms. Giant chain link necklaces were mishmashed. Keyrings jingled with everything from dices to miniature Eiffel Towers. Rider said he wanted to inject an element of fun. “I would never want to be perceived as cynical. Having a sense of humour in the luxury space is a beautiful thing,” he said. Bags ranging from colossal woven baskets and enormous leather totes to dainty pouches were emblazoned with logos ranging from a simple C to a “Triomphe” monogram, first created by the house's founder Céline Vipiana in 1971. Rider said he was drawn to a logo's fluid nature. “They can move from something really tasteful to quickly something that is very different from that. They can be many things.”"

Email tips@dailymail.com Kylie Jenner used Instagram to share a set of vacation photos with her 393 million followers on Sunday morning. The 27-year-old billionaire has been on holiday in St. Tropez with her sister Kendall Jenner and friends. In her latest carousel, the mother-of-two posed with a miniature Hermès handbag worth five figures. The fashion house's limited edition Kelly Doll purse retails between approximately $50,000 and $60,000, according to Sotheby's. One image showed the valuable accessory propped next to Kylie as she posed with a glass of wine, and elsewhere in the photo collection she held it in her hand for a mirror selfie. She held a larger iteration of the bag in two more snapshots showcasing her in a three-piece Chanel co-ord. The reality television star's look included a cleavage-baring bra top, micro corset, and mini skirt. She posed on a staircase while toting the pricey pocketbook near her hip while her tousled raven locks fell down her back. Jenner captioned the post with an infinity emoji, and she's already collected more than one million likes from her adoring fans. In addition to her sister, she was joined by three women, one of which was her longtime BFF Anastasia 'Stassie' Karanikolaou. The women wined and dined and also took a dip in the ocean as they enjoyed a luxurious boat day. Shortly before heading to France, Kylie was in Italy with her sisters and their mom Kris Jenner for the star-studded wedding of billionaire Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez. During the three-day bash, the internet dubbed her a 'vibe' as she went viral for steadily sipping a glass of wine throughout the various festivities. The drink-in-hand energy Kylie served at the nuptials earned praise from fans across various social media platforms. 'Kylie is a vibe!!' one posted in the comments section of a video of her at the celebrations, with another writing, 'Kylie ate,' along with a fire emoji. 'King Kylie is back,' another declared as someone else insisted she 'will always be that girl.' Her drink of choice also sparked a buzz across the internet, with some calling it 'relatable' and 'iconic.' 'The go-to glass of wine at the function is so me,' one TikToker quipped. 'How i want to be all summer drinking rosé, unbothered, happily wifed up,' that same TikToker wrote in another post. Described as the 'wedding of a century,' the 61-year-old Amazon founder and the former journalist, 55, exchanged vows in front of nearly 200 VIPs on San Giorgio Maggiore island in Venice, Italy. Following the intimate ceremony, the billionaire couple hosted a star-studded rave. The Bezos wedding began on a Thursday, with the first of three days of parties in Venice — but sources revealed that the lovebirds were married ahead of the weekend ceremony. A source closely connected to the organization of the events said: 'They have been married for at least a month, more than a month. 'The marriage is fully legal and took place in America under American law.'"

mov_3BEE1E781DEFA5D12543D944B424A16F,2025-07-06 19:32:04,en,WEB,"  The Invitation That Sparked Curiosity Two nights ago, I attended a Qatari wedding at the Grand Hyatt Doha — and I still find myself replaying it in my head. I've been to events before, but this one felt... different. Intimate. Magical. Deeply cultural. Have you ever walked into a room and felt like you were stepping into someone's fairytale? Phones Down, Glam On Before entering the venue, we were asked to seal our phones in small plastic pouches — no cameras, no social media, no distractions. At first, I felt the reflex to reach for my phone, to capture something, anything... but then I realized: maybe this night isn't meant to be captured. Maybe it's meant to be lived. Would you be okay giving up your phone for the night if it meant being fully present? An Entrance Fit for a Queen To the right: a mini salon for touch-ups. To the left: a coffee bar with Arabic blends and Turkish tea. And everywhere in between: fresh flowers, oversized mirrors, and perfume stations filled with Chanel, Dior, and elegant oud blends that lingered in the air like poetry. Before stepping into the event hall, we were in abayas. But just before entering, we gracefully took them off, revealing our evening gowns — each one more stunning than the next. Mine was a sparkly silver piece, but honestly? Every woman in that room looked like art. A Celebration of Femininity and Tradition We greeted one another cheek to cheek, guided to our table by the bride's sister. Even the servers wore pressed uniforms, gracefully pouring endless cups of karak and herbal tea. Everything was intentional — from the Narumi bone china plates to the floral centerpieces that stood tall like sculptures. And the food? Think creamy hummus, beef stew, chicken biryani, sambusa, and more. But more than taste, it was the energy of being surrounded by women in full bloom — confident, graceful, glowing — that truly fed my soul. Have you ever felt beauty in a room so strongly, it didn't need to be said out loud? Then She Walked In... The bride entered like a vision — her dress glittering like stardust, her pace soft and steady. Romantic music filled the room. Big screens framed her walk to the stage. She looked like she belonged in a fairytale, but one grounded in heritage and pride. There was a collective pause, a silent awe — the kind you don't interrupt. A Shift in Energy Later, we were asked to wear our abayas again — the groom and his family were about to arrive. The vibe shifted: a little more formal, a little more sacred. I watched as he gazed at the bride, visibly in love. And though no photos were allowed, that moment will live in my memory far longer than anything I could've posted. What This Night Taught Me It reminded me that sometimes, the most beautiful moments are the ones we don't capture. That elegance isn't about extravagance — it's about intention. And that when women come together in celebration, something powerful happens. Would you say yes to attending a wedding like this if invited? Would you leave your phone behind and trust the moment to hold itself? Let's Talk: Have you ever experienced a wedding that made you feel something this deeply? Or have you ever been to a cultural celebration that opened your eyes to a new kind of beauty? I'd love to hear your story — leave a comment or DM me on Instagram."

mov_73128F4F605401BDB64B9B418DCB4B50,2025-07-06 20:29:43,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Nach einem Jahr voller Musikstühle in der Mode ist der September eine seiner größten Showmonate aller Zeiten aller Zeiten vorbereitet: mit Debütsammlungen, die von neuen kreativen Direktoren bei Marken wie Matthieu Blazy bei Chanel und Ex-Balenciaga-Designer Demna bei Gucci abgefeuert wurden. Am Sonntag in Paris beschloss Michael Rider, der kürzlich Hedi Slimane bei Celine nachfolgt, einen Vorsprung. In einer Amuse-Bouche für die Art und Weise, wie er die Zukunft der Marke gestalten will, zeigte Rider eine Mischung aus Männern und Damenbekleidung. Die Show fand im weitläufigen Atelier der Marke statt, einem kurzen Sprung vom Tuileries Garden. Zu den Gästen gehörten der Schauspieler Naomi Watts und frisch aus 18 Monaten südkoreanischer Militärdienst, Kim Taehyung, von der K-Pop-Band BTS, die versuchte, unter einer riesigen Seide vor dem Regen zu schützen Das war über einem Innenhof errichtet worden. Für Rider, eine amerikanische Designerin, die zuvor während ihrer Amtszeit bei der Marke von 2008 bis 2017 unter Phoebe Philo arbeitete, war es ein Vollkreismoment. Während Fans ihrer Arbeit, bekannt als „Philophile“, gehofft hatten, dass Rider diese Ära der Louche -Schneiderei und des Minimalismus wieder einstellen würde, hat seine Eröffnungsaussehen solche Erwartungen schnell eingeschränkt. Anstelle von übergroßen Silhouetten gab es eine Reihe von Skinny -Jeans und sogar Skinner -Hosen, die Kälber so fest umarmten, dass sie mit einer Aufzirkulationswarnung einhergehen sollen. Diese mageren Silhouetten waren eine Anspielung auf seinen Vorgänger Slimane, der seinen charakteristischen, scharfkantigen Stil während seiner Stationen in Saint Laurent und Dior Homme verbesserte, bevor er ihn Celine vorstellte. Trotz anfänglicher Kritik erwies sich Slimane für die Muttergesellschaft LVMH von Celine lukrativ. Laut Analysten wurde er schätzungsweise den Jahresumsatz von Celine auf 2,5 Mrd. EUR (2,1 Mrd. GBP) verdoppelt und ihn hinter Louis Vuitton und Dior in die drittgrößte Marke von LVMH verwandelt. Im Oktober trat er jedoch unter Gerüchten über gescheiterte Vertragsverhandlungen zurück. Es liegt jetzt an Rider, diesen Geldstab zu holen. Die Ernennung von Rider erfolgt zu einer schwierigen Zeit in der Modebranche, wobei die Luxusmärkte erheblich verlangsamt haben (im ersten Quartal von 2025 meldete LVMH einen Umsatzrückgang von 4% gegenüber Mode- und Lederwaren). Auf der Jahreshauptversammlung im April 2024 sagte der Geschäftsführer von LVMH, Bernard Arnault,: „Celine ist schick, hip, sexy Mode für junge Menschen, auch wenn die Preise so sind, wie sie sind, und es funktioniert. “ Anstatt den Schiefer in dieser Zeit der Unsicherheit sauber zu löschen, scheint es, dass sich der Fahrer an der vorhandenen bewährten Formel der Marke weiterentwickelt. Nach der Show hinter der Bühne sagte Rider und sagte, er wollte nicht, dass es ein Gefühl der Löschung gibt “und fügte hinzu, dass” es eine Grundlage gibt, auf der ich mich aufbauen kann. Das fühlte sich modern, es fühlte sich ethisch an, es fühlte sich stark an. “ Rider balancierte diese Hommage an die Vergangenheit, indem er sie mit seiner eigenen modischen Geschichte verflechtete. Es gab Anspielungen auf seine amerikanischen Wurzeln und seine jüngste Zeit als Designdirektor von Polo Ralph Lauren, mit druckvollen, gefärbten Strick-Jumpern mit V-Ausschnitt, ordentlichen Oxford-Hemden und gestreiften Krawatten. Einfacher Abend sieht schwarz aus, einschließlich eines schulterfreien Kleides und der satinrafschen Blazer schienen sich an seine frühere Zeit bei Celine auf subtile Weise zu erinnern. Zubehör, die für Luxusmarken einfacher sind als ein Mantel von 5.000 Pfund, waren ein Fokus. Die Finger der Modelle wurden mit mehreren goldenen und primären farbigen Ringen bedeckt. Klobige Armreifen wurden auf Unterarmen gestapelt. Riesenkettenverbindungsketten wurden misshandelt. Keyrings schlängten mit allem, von Würfel bis zu Miniatur -Eiffeltürmen. Rider sagte, er wolle ein Element des Spaßes einbringen. “Ich würde niemals als zynisch empfunden werden. Ein Sinn für Humor im Luxusraum ist eine schöne Sache”, sagte er. Taschen, die von kolossalen gewebten Körben und riesigen Lederbeuteln bis hin zu zierlichen Beuteln reichen, wurden mit Logos, die von einem einfachen C bis zu einem „Triomphe“ -Monogramm reichen, das 1971 vom Gründer Céline Vipiana des Hauses erstellt wurde. Rider sagte, er sei von der fließenden Natur eines Logos angezogen. “Sie können sich von etwas, das wirklich Geschmackvolles zu etwas, das sich sehr davon unterscheidet, übergehen. Sie können viele Dinge sein.” Tags: PrevPreviousElder: Andere Präsidenten beschwerten"

I'm thinking of giving it a try because I have no idea how it feels like yet. Like 2 years ago, I was happy of having the “cheapest” coach bag available but now, I have a chanel. It feels surreal. I was okay selling it because of 1) monetary gain 2) I don't know how to handle things like this and I'M SCARED  — maybe it's time to give myself a go when it comes to things like this, like I deserve it too just as much as other people.

mov_D06BA3C883BA5F69F3C7EE8E455434D7,2025-07-06 21:09:05,en,WEB,"  Keira Knightley and musician James Righton have been together for over a decade and share two children. Yet, the relationship took Knightley by surprise. In an interview with TimeOut in 2014, she admitted that marriage wasn't really on her to-do list before meeting Righton. “My parents are deeply hippy. They got married because it was the only way they could get a mortgage at the time,” Knightley explained. “I grew up with them going, 'Don't know why you'd ever get married.' And then we did. It's nice. It's been fun. Until it isn't and then you get divorced! Fingers crossed for the future.” Righton was famous in his own right before meeting Knightley, playing with his band The Klaxons. In 2017, he told the New York Post Here is Knightley and Righton's complete relationship timeline so far. 2011 In October 2014, Knightley told The Guardian “[We met] through our mate Tim, not Alexa Chung, as people keep telling me,” she said. “We were very drunk.” She added, “He's the sort of person who will be the brightest light in any room, whereas I'm the one who sits in the corner. And he's much nicer than me.” May 2012 In May 2012, the couple got engaged, according to Reuters, who spoke with the star's publicist at the time, Sara Keene, who simply said, “I can confirm that Keira is engaged to be married to James Righton.” May 2013 The couple were married approximately a year later on May 4, 2013, holding a small ceremony of only 11 people in the small town of Mazan in the South of France, British Vogue reported. There was a reception later at Knightley's mother's house for a larger group. Knightley wore a couture Chanel minidress made of tulle and laced with silver, covered by a white tweed jacket by Karl Lagerfeld. In an interview with Elle UK For their honeymoon, the couple went to Corsica and were photographed enjoying the beautiful beaches. Righton told NME that his band the Klaxons were not affected by his high-profile wife, explaining, “I just fell in love with someone who happens to be amazing. We had a beautiful wedding and there was a lot of love.” “The music is the music,” he continued. “That thing is going to be there because of who she is but I'd say we're a pretty established band.” Of the wedding, he shared, “It was the greatest day ever, it was fantastic. We're still high from it. It was about two weeks ago, it was a big party.” December 2013 Knightley wore her Chanel wedding dress on the red carpet for the SeriousFun Children's Network London Gala at the Roundhouse. December 2014 The pair were reported to be expecting their first child in late 2014. February 2015 Knightley baby bump was visible at the Hollywood and Highland Center in Los Angeles in her tulle Valentino gown at the 2015 Academy Awards. May 2015 On May 26, 2015, Knightley and Righton welcomed their first child, Edie Knightley Righton. In August that year, Knightley told ELLE, “The love thing is astonishing. It's a very primal, primal love. That's quite extraordinary...And the ability to have no sleep and continue going. It's not pleasant—I never thought that I could actually do it for the amount of time that I've done it.” May 2019 In 2019, the couple revealed they were expecting again when Knightley's baby bump was visible as she left the Chanel J12 cocktail party in Paris. September 2019 On Sept. 13, 2019, their second daughter, Delilah Knightley Righton, was born...."

tw_sl_21191b1b15dcabf161013abf55b86b41,2025-07-06 21:26:54,en,WEB,"  Days of Our Lives synopses for the week of July 7-11 suggest there may be something seriously wrong with Tosoro, the baby that Javi and Leo are fostering. Sick babies often make for devastating storylines, and this soap opera has used them effectively in the past. Days of Our Lives has turned the favorite soap trope of a baby switch into a heartbreaking storyline about a newborn's death on several occasions. Most famously, the baby switch involving Sydney led to Sami discovering the truth after Chad and Mia's baby died of meningitis. More recently, Sarah learned that her baby had died. Sarah had been raising baby Rachel, who was Kristen's. This may come up again now that Rachel is ten years old and seems attached to Sarah. However, Days of Our Lives has also brought plenty of drama involving baby Tosoro, who nobody yet knows is Marlena's (Days of Our Lives' Deidre Hall) grandson. What's Happening This Week on Days of Our Lives: July 7-11 Leo Fears Something Is Wrong With The Baby The baby ordeal begins on Tuesday, with Leo having a hard time calming the screaming infant. This in itself is nothing new, as he was complaining about the baby being fussy last week. However, this time, Leo worries aloud that something is wrong. Related Days of Our Lives Says Goodbye to Beloved Duo as Young Characters' Lives Take Dramatic Turns One Days of Our Lives legacy couple will leave Salem far too soon, but their farewell comes alongside a meaty story for the younger generation. Gabi has raised an infant before, so it would be wise for Leo to put aside his differences with her and let her help. However, it's likely that Leo will panic and insist on taking the baby to the hospital. Hopefully, Javi will help him calm down, given his EMT experience. Here are the synopses for each day this week: - Monday, July 7: Sophia has mixed feelings about giving the baby up — will she change her mind? Xander and Sarah have another argument. Tate and Holly discuss their plans for the getaway. Chad bonds with Cat. - Tuesday, July 8: Gwen returns to Salem, wearing Julie's necklace. Will she give it up without demanding something in return? Julie and Chad are shocked to see Gwen. Leo has a hard time with the baby. Rafe busts Ari. Alex and Stephanie try again for evening romance. - Wednesday, July 9: Belle worries about Marlena. Is the renowned therapist's grief turning into a serious physical illness? Doug III tries to push Ari away. Leo opens up to Javi about his checkered past. Bonnie confronts Sarah with the truth. Xander reconnects with Gwen. - Thursday, July 10: Tony has a warning for EJ. Will EJ take it seriously? Chanel offers Johnny support. Belle and Jada discover something surprising. Xander faces off with Philip again. - Friday, July 11: Jada interrogates Chanel. Will she arrest her and let Johnny go? Paulina fills Johnny in. EJ works Belle. Xander clashes with Maggie, while Sarah tries to convince Philip to come forward with the truth. What Big Storyline We're Following This Week The Baby Story Could Have Serious Implications Although there are several exciting developments, the baby story is the one to watch this week because of its implications for several characters. Nobody yet knows that this is Sophia and Tate's baby, but that could change if Leo brings it to the hospital...."
mov_5D8514CF4D90412EDFA083D3C6F75C86,2025-07-06 21:51:19,fr,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[fr]Ce dimanche 6 juillet, la marinière bretonne a suscité un vif débat sur les réseaux après sa mise à l'honneur dans ""Capital"". Entre fierté régionale et moqueries sur son appropriation par les touristes, les internautes n'ont pas manqué de réagir. Ce dimanche 6 juillet, ""Capital"" a proposé un numéro inédit estival consacré aux trésors bretons qui font rayonner la région bien au-delà de ses frontières. Des îles prisées des vacanciers aux emblématiques marinières, en passant par les galettes de Pont-Aven, le magazine de M6 a exploré les coulisses d'un patrimoine local qui attire, innove… et rapporte gros. Avec 3,7 millions de touristes en 2024, les îles bretonnes comme Belle-Île-en-Mer, Groix ou Ouessant ont confirmé leur statut de véritables machines à cash. ""Capital"" a mis en lumière des initiatives locales pleines d'ingéniosité : lodges tout confort en pleine nature, location de voitures face à une concurrence bien implantée, ou encore restauration gastronomique avec des produits ultra-locaux. Mais la Bretagne ne se résume pas à ses paysages de carte postale. Le magazine a ensuite levé le voile sur une guerre méconnue, mais féroce : celle des galettes bretonnes à Pont-Aven, où plusieurs biscuiteries se disputent l'héritage d'un produit emblématique. La dernière partie de l'émission s'est penchée sur un autre emblème breton : la marinière. Ce vêtement à rayures, devenu star des vacances et synonyme d'été, s'affiche sur tous les marchés du littoral. Produit iconique, il se vend chaque année par millions, dans une multitude de versions allant de 15 à plus de 100 euros. Si elle évoque immanquablement les marins et l'océan, la marinière a pourtant une histoire bien plus complexe. Initialement uniforme militaire porté par les marins dès la fin du XIXe siècle, la marinière a été popularisée dans les années 30 par Coco Chanel. Depuis, elle s'est imposée comme un vêtement iconique, indissociable de l'image de la Bretagne. Mais derrière cette réputation se cache une réalité plus nuancée. Certaines marinières sont encore fabriquées localement, dans le respect d'un savoir-faire artisanal, avec près de 40 minutes de travail nécessaires pour en produire une, à un coût de revient estimé à 27 euros. D'autres, en revanche, sont confectionnées à l'étranger pour maximiser les marges. Le reportage a également soulevé la question des conditions de travail, en montrant que certaines entreprises chronomètrent désormais leurs couturières pour maximiser la productivité. Sur les réseaux sociaux, la séquence a fait réagir. Si certains ont apprécié le coup de projecteur sur ce vêtement ""typiquement breton"", d'autres se sont moqués de son image. Sur X, l'ancien Twitter, de nombreux internautes ont souligné que la marinière était surtout portée par… les touristes et non par des Bretons. ""C'est d'ailleurs comme ça qu'on les reconnaît"" a ironisé un abonné de X. Preuve, s'il en fallait, que la marinière reste un symbole fort – parfois caricatural – de la culture bretonne. Entre fierté locale, stratégie marketing et folklore touristique, ce vêtement continue de susciter les débats… et de faire vendre, été après été."

n1pleuf,2025-07-06 22:24:54,en,REDDIT,"  That doesn't make any sense from a Business/marketing/branding perspective. Should someone try a fragrance with lower quality with a certain name, they would conclude that that fragrance is not good regardless of retailer. Different product lines is a different story. They Indeed have this in fragrances (e.g., exclusive lines of Dior, Chanel, are better and cost more than their mainstream product lines)."

mov_9209ADC110EA1B95B06BA40BC9E7FD89,2025-07-07 02:26:52,en,WEB,"  Provocative Georgian showman Demna is to take a final bow after 10 years at Balenciaga during Paris Haute Couture Week, which begins Monday and will also feature a debut for Maison Margiela's new chief creative. Demna, known for his daring work as well as controversies during his decade-long stint at Kering-owned Balenciaga, will unveil his final collection on Wednesday in what is expected to be one of the highlights of the week. Not to be confused with Paris Fashion Week, Haute Couture Week takes place exclusively in Paris — in January for spring-summer collections and July for autumn-winter. It is a uniquely French event dedicated to handcrafted, one-of-a-kind creations made to wear at red carpets, galas, and other high-profile events. The 44-year-old Demna, acclaimed by millennials and Gen-Z stars from Kim Kardashian to British pop sensation Charli XCX, has been tasked with reviving the flagging fortunes of Gucci by Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault. After multiplying sales at Balenciaga, where he made headlines with a $2,000 ""Ikea"" bag and a $1,800 so-called ""trash pouch"", he is currently being honoured with an exhibition titled ""Balenciaga by Demna"" at Kering's Paris headquarters. He will be succeeded by Italian designer Pierpaolo Piccioli, who is set to present his first collection in October during Paris Women's Fashion Week. As usual, Schiaparelli will open Couture Week, followed later in the day by shows from Iris Van Herpen —- returning after a year-long break -— as well as Georges Hobeika, Imane Ayissi, Rahul Mishra, Julie de Libran, and Giambattista Valli. After Demna's farewell on Wednesday, Belgian designer Glenn Martens will find himself in the spotlight as he unveils a first collection for Maison Margiela following his appointment in January to succeed British designer John Galliano. American designer Michael Rider, who succeeded Hedi Slimane as chief designer at Celine, unveiled his first collection for the luxury French brand on Sunday, outside the official calendar. – Absences – On Tuesday, Chanel will present the final collection created by its in-house design studio, the fifth since Virginie Viard's sudden departure in June 2024. More in Style Her successor, the discreet and highly respected Franco-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy, was appointed in December and will showcase his first collection for Chanel in October. Up to Thursday, 27 houses will unveil their creations, including Elie Saab, Armani Prive, Aelis, Viktor&Rolf, Adeline Andre, and Dubai-based Rami Al Ali who is set to become the first Syrian to join the official calendar. Following a spate of major changes at fashion houses, some absences will stand out, particularly Dior's. After a highly anticipated debut during the men's Fashion Week on June 27, newly appointed artistic director Jonathan Anderson is holding back his first haute couture collection for January 2026. Named in early June to lead Dior's women's and couture lines as well, the 40-year-old Northern Irishman has become the first person since founder Christian Dior himself to oversee all three branches of the house. Jean Paul Gaultier is also missing. Dutch designer Duran Lantink, appointed as the brand's permanent artistic director in April, will make his debut during Women's Fashion Week in October. Since stepping back in 2020, Jean Paul Gaultier has handed over the reins of his couture collections to a series of guest designers, including Olivier Rousteing, Ludovic de Saint Sernin, Haider Ackermann, and Simone Rocha. The week will wrap up with a show by Swiss designer Kevin Germanier. mdv-adp/gv/tc"

n1r8iy7,2025-07-07 04:42:41,en,REDDIT,"  John Black, Victor Kiriakis, and Doug Williams have all died fairly recently due to the real-life deaths of the actors. A few major recent and current story arcs: (but don't read them if you're going to go back and watch the past couple of seasons, which is what I recommend doing) PART 1 (Part 2 is in a separate reply, because I seem to be running into text length limitations: Xander Cook is married to Sarah Horton (daughter of Maggie and Neil Curtis). Xander turns out to have been Victor's son, and Victor left Titan and half the mansion to him in his will. Phillip and Vivian (Alamain) forged a letter from ""Victor"" saying that he wanted to leave the company to Phillip, but couldn't because Phillip was in a mental institution [long story]. Phillip used the letter to sue Xander for the estate. The judge awarded half of the company to each of them. Kate, Sarah, Maggie, Alex (Kiriakis, Justin's son), and Stephanie (Johnson, daughter of Steve and Kayla) knew about the forgery, but for various reasons none of them either made it public or told Xander about it. Eventually in a fit of spite, Vivian told Xander. Xander proceeded to attack Phillip and beat him within an inch of his life. When Phillip was near death, he sneered to Xander that Sarah had known about the forgery. So now Xander is furious with Sarah and they're splitting up. They've been fighting about custody of their 1-year-old daughter, Victoria. Phillip is recovering from Xander's attack. Xander and Phillip as Titan co-CEOs have taken over DiMera Enterprises and are now co-CEOs of Titan/DiMera. They're stuck continuing to work together because they each have enough blackmail fodder on the other to ruin him. Paulina is a relatively recent addition to the cast of characters, within the past 5 years or so. She is the mother of Chanel and Lani (although until a few years ago, Lani thought Paulina was her aunt). She is a world class busybody and quite bossy, and is constantly crossing lines in her sincere but grossly misguided attempts to ""help"" people. Paulina moved to Salem from Florida, where she was a wealthy and powerful businesswoman. She is married to Abe. Abe, who was Mayor at the time, got shot and kidnapped (by two different people) and had amnesia. When he got some of his memory back but it was obvious he wasn't at 100%, Paulina replaced him as Mayor. Paulina's younger daughter Chanel is married to Johnny (EJ and Sami's son, and one of the few sane DiMeras). She owns a bakery called ""Sweet Bits."" She and Johnny were planning to adopt the baby of Tate (Black, Brady and Teresa's son) and Sophia, but when Johnny found out that he was conceived via his father raping his mother, he decided he wasn't ready for fatherhood because he didn't want to be like his own father."

mov_801B7660E2D45F44E563CE207FAC3500,2025-07-07 08:54:43,en,WEB,"  Designer brands such as Coach, Fendi and Hugo Boss have been listed as buyers of raw materials sourced from destroyed forests in Para, the northern Brazilian state set to host the UN Climate Conference, COP30, in November.The allegations, which most companies have denied, are detailed in a report published by Earthsight, a UK-based non profit focused on environmental and injustice investigations. Their findings draw on thousands of records of Brazilian leather exports, data on the cattle sector, court rulings and satellite imagery, as well as interviews and on-the-ground research. ""Consumers probably expect that when buying a luxury product, the high price tag guarantees some level of ethics and sustainability,"" Lara Shirra White, an Earthsight researcher, told DW. ""They don't expect that the leather bag might be linked to deforestation and human rights violations."" The NGO warns of products made from the hides of cattle reared on farms embargoed for environmental violations, including some operating illegally within Para's Apyterewa Indigenous Territory, which was heavily deforested during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro from 2019 to 2022. As part of its research, Earthsight investigated the business operations of Frigol, a Brazilian meatpacking company identified as one of the buyers of cattle raised on the territory.The report says at least 17,000 animals were sold to Frigol between 2020 and 2023, which is ""enough to produce 425 tons of leather."" Researchers linked some of those cattle to illegal farms but said it's not possible to determine the exact number that left Apyterewa, in part because Frigol itself ""does not trace most of its indirect suppliers."" The report says this gap in reporting leaves the company's ""supply chain vulnerable to the widespread practice of 'cattle laundering,'"" in which cows from illegal farms are transferred to legally registered properties before being sold.Paulo Barreto, senior researcher at the Brazilian conservation and sustainable development Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon, Imazon, said control over indirect suppliers is either nonexistent or incomplete. ""As a result, cattle raised in illegally deforested areas end up entering the market as if they were legal. The lack of a transparent public system regarding the origin of the cattle makes control difficult."" Frigol, however, told DW via email that it does not purchase cattle from Indigenous lands and monitors 100% of its direct suppliers. ""We are committed to working together with industry institutions, the production chain and public authorities to make progress,"" the company said in a statement. It added that it believes ""only individual traceability of animals for socio-environmental purposes will make it possible to mitigate deforestation across all links of the cattle supply chain."" According to Earthsight's research, after the animals are slaughtered at Frigol's facilities, a percentage of cow skins are exported, in part by the Brazilian leather company Durlicouros, which shipped 14,700 tons of hide to Italy between 2020 and 2023. Some of that, the report found, went to the Italian tanneries Conceria Cristina and Faeda.The research lists high-end names like Coach, Fendi, Chloé, Hugo Boss and Saint Laurent among Conceria Cristina's clients. Faeda, meanwhile, provides leather to brands such as Chanel, Balenciaga and Gucci, according to the investigation.In response to a DW request for comment, Chanel cited deforestation as a ""major concern"" and said it no longer works with Faeda due to unmet traceability requirements: ""92% of the calfskin we use is sourced from Europe, and we audit slaughterhouses and farms outside Europe to ensure they are not in deforestation zones.The Kering Group, which owns Balenciaga, Gucci, and Saint Laurent, told DW that while the two Italian companies mentioned in the report are suppliers, ""the leather they provide to any Kering house does not come from Brazil. ""Based on Earthsight's findings, Hugo Boss issued a statement to say it had conducted a detailed review, and could ""confirm that none of the leather"" it is supplied with ""is connected to any of the alleged parties in connection with the investigation. ""LVMH, which owns Fendi and Louis Vuitton, said it has a system capable of tracing the origin of 98% of the leather used in its products and that it does not source this from South America. And Tapestry, which owns the Coach brand, wrote to DW saying that while the system for tracking raw materials in Brazil is ""complex and imperfect,"" it is working to be ""part of the solution to improve traceability and transparency. ""Chloé, Conceria Cristina and Faeda had not responded to a DW request for comment at the time of publication.Durlicouros told DW that it tracks its indirect suppliers and participates in discussions on state and national models for full traceability and compliance."" In addition, all Durlicouros facilities are certified by the Leather Working Group (LWG), ensuring high standards of sustainability, traceability, and environmental responsibility, according to the purpose of each facility. ""But Earthsight researcher Lara Shirra White said companies often use the certification to vouch for the ethics and sustainability of the leather they produce ""instead of conducting meaningful due diligence themselves to ensure their supply chains are deforestation-free. ""She said the problem with the LWG, founded in 2005, is that ""it does not require traceability back to the farms,"" and can therefore not account for environmental and human rights abuses in the areas where the cattle are raised.The LWG told DW it is enhancing its ""due diligence requirements related to deforestation and land conversion,"" which will ""include establishing a chain of custody system that would support more detailed traceability across the leather value chain. ""There is some hope that the European Union's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) could make a contribution to change. Due to come into effect at the end of this year after a 12-month delay, it will ban the purchase of products originating from destroyed forest areas. "" We hope the law will be implemented on schedule, despite certain sectors of the industry still trying, in some way, to exclude leather from the scope of the legislation,"" Rafael Pieroni, a researcher at Earthsight, told DW.However, he said the report also contains a message for the Brazilian government. "" It should implement traceability and make all data public. Transparency is the best way to avoid all the illegalities we are exposing in our investigation,"" he said."

mov_56976A01C370911F92864B9515BA860A,2025-07-07 10:30:00,en,WEB,"  Five questions with Deseri Kelley, whose “little pieces of confidence” are a status symbol in a once-stuffy city trying to change its stripes. Dallas native Deseri Kelley is a good ambassador for her brand: Fashionable, savvy and Hollywood beautiful. The former teacher at Mesquite ISD, with roots in Trinidad and Tobago, is now an entrepreneur with a line of finely crafted handbags. In 2024, when her Deseri shop opened at the Galleria, Kelley became the first Black woman with her own designer store in the mall's history. Her distinctive purses and clutches have names like Diva and Paris and Halo (a 2008 Beyonce song), with pricetags mostly ranging in the mid-hundreds, a relatively low cost for designer bags. A Birkin, for instance, starts at $9,000. Kelley is married to former lawyer Kevin Kelley, the man behind Kitchen + Kocktails, a posh downtown spot with locations in Chicago and Washington, D.C. When the couple moved their sons to Europe for a few years to nurture the boys' soccer careers, Kelley learned about meticulous bags crafted in Spain and carried by Americans, and later she enlisted some of those artisans to make her Texas-based line, distinguished by its double-D logo and the gold head of a fox, a fitting insignia for a woman who has proven very cunning, indeed. How do you describe Dallas to people who don't live here? A perfect blend of big city and small-town charm. Dallasites make big moves, whether it's business, fashion or music. But it's also super-friendly and down-to-earth. What bothers you about Dallas? I wish Dallas were a little more inclusive. We're growing so fast, but there's still some work to do to make everyone feel like they belong and get a seat at the table. You became obsessed with handbags at 9. Why does such a small accessory mean so much? Handbags are more than just accessories. They're like a little piece of confidence you carry around. They tell a story, boost your vibe and when you have the right one, it makes you feel unstoppable. Our city is very brand-conscious. Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Hermes — as long as a label is popular, Dallas women will carry the handbag. Is it possible to give Dallas women permission to be trend-setters instead of trend-followers? Dallas women have tremendous potential to lead and set trends rather than follow them. It's about encouraging confidence in individual style and celebrating authenticity over brand hype. I think it's about embracing what feels authentic and making your look your own. Will you join me in asking the fine women of Dallas to stop carrying those dang Louis Vuitton purses? I've been seeing those brown leather buckets for, like, 40 years! Absolutely! While Louis Vuitton is a classic heritage brand, I do believe Dallas women should be carrying a Deseri handbag instead."
1ltr2c8,2025-07-07 10:51:51,en,REDDIT,"  So far, it's been working for me. I shop out of boredom, stress or to impress. What I'm doing now is that if I see something in social media that I want to buy if I can't get it out of my mind I just order it and see how ugly, bad or how I really don't like it in me and usually always end up returning. Since I also shop out of boredom if I want it at the moment I will order it and when I get it it either doesn't fit me right or it's not what I thought I will return it. Sometimes it might be sometime I like and would keep it and other times I'll keep it as I usually do for the thrill then usually a week later is laying around already forgotten and I'll return. I don't go to the stores to buy not even Walmart. I subscribed to their services and I order for delivery so I don't have to step in the store. Also do the same with other stores. I buy and convince myself it was not what I really wanted or needed. Another way is that if I see a white shirt I like but I already own a white shirt I will search for the buttons that make that new shirt different from the one I have and buy the buttons and change them and problem solved. I have one white shirt I love and I keep changing the buttons by buying different ones at very affordable prices either Amazon, hobby lobby, Etsy, etc. I also do it with jacket, blazers and pants. I have these shoes clip in that will change any color shoes or heels I wear into another style. I read a lot of reviews on cosmetics, cream and lotions and I mostly stick with the bad ones and just desist of buying it. If I do really want an item I print the image out or keep it in my phone. I wait whatever time that is usually not that long that with coupons and discounts what would have cost me $100 I just paid maybe $25. From my expensive bags I've fallen in love with the silent luxury and I've separated my discreet bag for example my Chanel flap bag and the others that are with large or many logos I have placed aside. To sell whenever a financial emergency arises in my home. Or would sell to buy another one in exchange if I wanted another one. But I would buy one bag only if I sold another one. I have to admit that coming to Christianity has helped me alot bc I can't just go to buy an expensive bag and justify it. Reading my Bible, watching different contents in YouTube like people recovering from shopping addiction helps a lot. Also keeping my mind busy. The biggest wake-up and slap to my face comes when I budget and see what damaged I've done and the extra time I have to work to pay that off that I could have saved or use towards family moments. Thank you for reading and hope it can help someone too."
mov_A75069820AF8A135A69D6F4B09E8731D,2025-07-07 11:05:56,en,WEB,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com She became a bona fide WAG when she tied the knot with footballer Bradley Dack in a lavish central London ceremony in the summer of 2023. But Olivia Attwood has hit out at the 'stigma' of being the partner of a successful sportsman, insisting she funds her lavish lifestyle and has worked 'relentlessly' since being catapulted to fame when she left the Love Island villa in 2017. The TV personality, 34, dated Bradley, 31, prior to entering the ITV reality show and he was already a footballer playing for League Two team Gillingham FC. Olivia slammed 'gold digger' claims and said it doesn't matter what job her husband has because she works 'seven days a week'. She told MailOnline: 'I think people are like, ""She works seven days a week, surely she's got some f*****g cash"". 'Maybe in the beginning when Brad and I first started dating, there was a bit of a stigma around it [dating someone who plays sport for a living]. 'And people can kind of go, ""Oh"", a bit of an eye roll and stupid comments like, ""Oh my gosh she's with him cos he plays football"". 'I've got my own money, so it doesn't really matter what he does for a job.' Straight-talking Olivia shot to fame thanks to her stint in the Love Island villa in the summer of 2017, which saw her reach the show final with her ex-boyfriend Chris Hughes, 32, who she dated until February 2018. The former grid girl has since become a household name and a regular face on TV, appearing on The Only Way Is Essex, I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here! , This Morning and Loose Women. Olivia has also fronted many of her own shows and presented Bad Boyfriends, Getting Filthy Rich and The Price Of Perfection - admitting she has 'bitten the hands off' TV executives for 'big jobs, little jobs, whatever I could get'. But this success did not come overnight and she told how she 'grafted' when she left the villa while working relentlessly to get where she is today. Olivia told MailOnline: 'Post Love Island, I knew where I wanted to be. I knew I wanted to stay working in television, and I was very dedicated to that, and everything I've done is working towards that bigger goal. 'I've been very patient and I've learnt the craft, I'm still learning, I've taken the big jobs, the little jobs, whatever I could get, I just bite their hand off for it.' 'Relentlessly pursuing that bigger goal and I'm working really hard at it, it doesn't come overnight', she added. 'Even when you get a big platform like Love Island, you still need to prove yourself to people. 'I think sometimes people become impatient off the back of reality shows, but these kind of things, they don't happen overnight, you have to stick with it. It takes graft.' Olivia has enjoyed the spoils of a lavish lifestyle thanks to her lucrative television career and is regularly seen toting around Chanel and Hermes handbags. She has also enjoyed many luxurious trips throughout the years - in the last nine weeks she has been seen in France, Miami and Ibiza. In her popular TV documentary, Price Of Perfection, Olivia was very candid about her own cosmetic tweakments and confessed she spends a 'couple of grand a month' maintaining her image. Olivia and footballer Bradley originally began dating before she went looking for love in the Mallorcan Love Island villa in 2017. The pair met at a nightclub in the West End back in 2015 after being introduced through mutual friends. They dated on and off for three months before the romance fizzled out and Olivia decided to go on Love Island - later confirming Bradley was the ex she spoke about in her introduction clip. Olivia and Chris broke up in February 2018, less than a year after they reached the final of Love Island - and it wasn't long before the star was back with Bradley, with the couple reuniting in early 2018. Olivia announced their engagement in October 2019, sharing sweet snaps of the couple on a beach in Dubai after the footballer popped the question. Alongside the photos, she wrote: 'He must be crazy... Here's to forever. I love you BD.' The pair then got married in June 2023 at luxury five-star hotel Bulgari in Knightsbridge. Surrounded by 80 friends and family and with her proud father, Kai, by her side, Olivia looked exquisite in a bespoke £30,000 lace-sleeved gown by designer Galia Lahav, which was just one of two stunning outfits she wore on the day. Olivia has now teamed up with Costa Coffee for the new Costa Hypeline – a one-day service delivering motivational voice notes from Roman Kemp and Olivia in celebration of the brand's cold latte cans. The personalised voice notes are hoped to to hype people up when they need it most, turning pre-interview jitters, mid-afternoon lulls, or even laundry-day dread into moments of motivation. Live on July 17, the Hypeline responds to Gen Z's growing need for everyday motivation. Olivia said: 'We often underestimate how powerful the little things can be. When we build these boosts into our routine, they give us something to look forward to and help break up the day in a positive way. 'When you give yourself those small moments of joy, you're better equipped to handle whatever the day throws at you. 'It's not about doing more, it's about feeling better while you do it. 'Motivation is an important thing as most of us hit a wall way before lunchtime. A little hype can go a long way. 'I'm buzzing to be on the other end of the line with Costa, handing out some words of encouragement. 'We'll be managing the Costa Hypeline for one day only on July 17 to help give out those much-needed boosts of productivity – message in for a hype!'"

Demna, known for his daring work as well as controversies during his decade-long stint at Kering-owned Balenciaga, will unveil his final collection on Wednesday in what is expected to be one of the highlights of the week. The 44-year-old, acclaimed by millennials and Gen-Z stars from Kim Kardashian to British pop sensation Charli XCX, has been tasked with reviving the flagging fortunes of Gucci by Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault. Another of his biggest fans, rapper Cardi B, turned up at Schiaparelli on Monday in a traffic-stopping tasslled neckpiece and posed with a crow in the drizzle in front of the Petit Palais exhibition space. She took her seat on the front row alongside singer Dua Lipa, who wore a full-length petalled white outfit with daring cutaways. The Schiaparelli collection featured an impressive black-and-white ruffled gown, long sculptural evening dresses and refined tailored suits in a palette dominated by white, black and silver, with accents of bright red. Haute Couture Week is dedicated to handcrafted, one-of-a-kind creations made to wear at red carpets, galas and other high-profile events. Schiaparelli was followed by a show by Dutch designer Iris Van Herpen, who said her creations were inspired by the ocean and British documentary maker David Attenborough's heart-rending new film on sealife. Georges Hobeika, Imane Ayissi, Rahul Mishra, Julie de Libran and Giambattista Valli were set to follow later in the day. American Michael Rider, who succeeded Hedi Slimane as chief designer at Celine, unveiled his first collection for the luxury French brand on Sunday, outside the official calendar. – Absences – After Demna's farewell on Wednesday, Belgian designer Glenn Martens will find himself in the spotlight when he unveils a first collection for Maison Margiela, following his appointment in January to succeed British designer John Galliano. On Tuesday, Chanel will present the final collection created by its in-house design studio, the fifth since Virginie Viard's sudden departure in June 2024. Her successor, the discreet and highly respected Franco-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy, was appointed in December and will showcase his first collection for Chanel in October. In total, 27 houses will unveil their creations, including Elie Saab, Armani Prive, Aelis, Viktor&Rolf, Adeline Andre and Dubai-based Rami Al Ali, who is set to become the first Syrian to join the official Paris calendar. Following a spate of major changes at fashion houses, some absences will stand out, particularly Dior's. After a highly anticipated debut during the men's Fashion Week on June 27, newly appointed artistic director Jonathan Anderson is holding back his first haute couture collection for January 2026. Named in early June to lead Dior's women's and couture lines as well, the 40-year-old Northern Irishman has become the first person since founder Christian Dior himself to oversee all three branches of the house. Jean Paul Gaultier is also missing. Dutch designer Duran Lantink, appointed as the brand's permanent artistic director in April, will make his debut during Women's Fashion Week in October. Since stepping back in 2020, Jean Paul Gaultier has handed over the reins of his couture collections to a series of guest designers, including Olivier Rousteing, Ludovic de Saint Sernin, Haider Ackermann and Simone Rocha. The week will wrap up with a show by Swiss designer Kevin Germanier. mdv-adp/gil"

mov_C1CA362ABBF7B5A6605C9B67B6F3606B,2025-07-07 11:53:15,en,WEB,"  Brooklyn Beckham's wife Nicola Peltz shared a series of pointed posts about family amid the escalating feud with his famous family. The aspiring chef, 26, and his actress partner, 30, are at the centre of highly publicised apparent rift with David and Victoria Beckham, having snubbed several milestones on social media and major family events in recent months. Brooklyn - who lives in Los Angeles with Nicola - has reportedly “cut off all contact” with his parents as well as his siblings, Romeo, Cruz, and Harper. Amid the tension, Nicola made a series of seemingly pointed remarks that appeared to highlight her close bond with her own family during a yacht trip. The Transformers star posted a photo of Labubu dolls lined up in a row on her Instagram story, writing, “Our little family,” before sharing a snap of her mother Claudia posing with one of Pop Mart dolls attached to her Chanel bag with the caption: “My mom just gets it.” She also shared a photo of her hugging her billionaire father Nelson Peltz, penning alongside it, “I love you so much dad,” and working out with her brother, Zach, with the caption: “My trainer.” It comes just days after Nicola appeared to subtly hit out at accusations that she “controls” Brooklyn. She liked a fan comment on Instagram that read: “The fact people are in this comment section talking bs about someone controlling a GROWN man is absurd. “The guy is an adult and can make his own decisions. Leave them be and stop blaming women for everything.” This followed a post about her and Brooklyn attending her father Nelson's 83rd birthday, while previously snubbing David's four lavish 50th birthday celebrations in May. While neither side has publicly confirmed a rift, rumours first emerged following Brooklyn and Nicola's extravagant £3 million wedding in Palm Beach in 2022, with reports suggesting that former Spice Girl turned fashion designer Victoria, 51, felt sidelined during the planning. Though there was a brief show of unity at Victoria's Paris Fashion Week show last year, the relationship between the families appears to have worsened. Brooklyn and Nicola raised eyebrows when they failed to attend Victoria's 51st birthday in Miami in April and skipped David's birthday festivities a month later. The eldest Beckham child intensified the gossip by saying he will “always choose” Nicola in a “pointed message” to his partner in June."

Cardi B, wrapped in a custom Schiaparelli gown of graphic fringe, stood beneath the gilded columns of the Petit Palais, holding a live crow on her arm.

It was a fitting image for Schiaparelli. , built her legend in the 1930s by weaving the unexpected —l obster dresses, shoe hats, and, yes, animals — into the heart of high fashion. That legacy pulsed through Daniel Roseberry's Fall 2025 collection, a spectacle in pure black and white, staged as if the city itself had been drained of color, leaving only stark contrast and raw emotion. Inside, the mood was cinematic — sharp tailoring, sweeping gowns, hints of disco sheen flickering like film across the runway. But if the house has been criticized in the past for relying on extreme corsetry and body manipulation, this season marked a shift. Roseberry, perhaps heeding the critics, abandoned his signature corset silhouette. In its place: a freer, more elastic exploration of the body, echoing Schiaparelli's own restless spirit. Roseberry said the collection was inspired by the moment in 1940, when Elsa Schiaparelli fled Nazi-occupied Paris for New York — a period “when life and art was on the precipice: to the sunset of elegance, and to the end of the world as we knew it.” Here, that tension was alive in every look: archival codes reimagined, but with a restless push toward the future. Dresses undulated like car bodies, hips arced in impossibly engineered shapes, ribbons from antique Lyon couture fluttered as kinetic sculptures. Yet the show was more than spectacle. This was couture at its most essential — an ideas factory for the entire fashion industry, unfettered by trends. “Chanel was interested in how clothes could be of practical use to women; Elsa was interested in what fashion could be,” Roseberry added. It is this what-if energy, the transformation of memory, myth, and sheer technique into something never seen before, that keeps couture vital, even as the world rushes toward AI and disposable fast fashion. The setting only heightened the effect. The Petit Palais is currently home to an exhibit on Charles Worth, the 19th-century Englishman who invented haute couture by bringing artistry and handcraft to Paris. The symmetry was irresistible: in these halls, Schiaparelli's past collided with fashion's future, reminding all why couture matters: not as museum piece, but as living laboratory for risk, reinvention, and radical beauty. A decade after its relaunch, Schiaparelli has found commercial traction and become a fixture on the world's red carpets, a rare feat in today's luxury market. But above all, the brand's power lies in its ability to surprise. On opening day, as Cardi B's crow threatened to take flight, Schiaparelli proved that in Paris, fashion's most potent magic is still the unexpected."

In a different post 2 months ago, OP tells how her BF proposed to her (see below); but a few hours ago she mentioned in an unrelated post that she'd broken up with her BF 2 months ago… My bf and I have been together for eight months and things have great so far. I love him and honestly could've seen me spending my life with him. Until yesterday. For his birthday he asked if I could cook him his favorite meal and just spend the day together in my apartment. The plan was to have him over at noon, but at around 11 he called me and said his friends wanted to take him out, so he'd be coming over for dinner. I already had things cooking but decided not to start a fight since it was his birthday. I didn't hear anything from him until 6 when he pounded on my door. I opened the door and he was with his friend who dropped him off cause my bf got drunk. He's never gotten drunk in the middle of the day like that before since we've been together. He does drink and it doesn't bother me, but I just didn't like this. I asked my bf if he wanted his food and he said no, but he wanted to tell me something. He went on about how much he loved me and how great I am and how he couldn't wait to put a lot of babies in me. Then he emphasized the baby thing again by saying he couldn't wait to watch my stomach swell and to see me feeding our children the ""natural way"". It honestly was so weird how fixated he was on that. After all that he got down on one knee and pulled out a ring that he said he designed himself. A ring I had no clue existed and we've never talked about. We have talked about getting married, but not about the proposal. The ring is pretty, but I would've liked to have at least had a conversation. I did tell him yes, but I just feel so conflicted. Again, he's been so great, but I do not like this side of him. Even after the proposal he asked if he could lay down cause he was feeling dizzy and fell asleep. He woke up at around midnight and I took him home so he could make it to work today. I asked if he remembered the proposal and he said yes. He says he thinks it's great it happened that way cause it's a funny story to tell. I don't find it that funny, but I don't know. I don't need advice I just want to vent because I do not know what to do and I think I'm just overthinking this."

U.S. Soccer, a 501(c)(3) nonprofit and the official governing body of soccer in the U.S., will be the first tenant to occupy one of five pre-built suites currently under construction on the building's 23rd floor.

In addition, The Soloviev Foundation proudly supports the Federation's mission to work further to promote soccer and grow the game across the country. As U.S. Soccer works to grow soccer in the U.S., New York City represents a strategically important market and establishing a presence in the city will enable the Federation to better meet its evolving organizational needs and accelerate its efforts in service to soccer. This momentous move is generously funded by an anonymous philanthropic contribution.

n1t9rpt,2025-07-07 14:27:31,en,REDDIT,"  If I was purchasing Chanel, I would be really frustrated if they gave me the pair she didn't keep. I mean, I already don't like getting an item that has clearly been opened and returned when it's Amazon, so with the Chanel price tag, I wouldn't want to buy anything that someone else has worn before me. But it's just me I'm not sure if that's why people are not here with buying multiple pairs knowing you will return some. I also think it's wasting time and effort of the people who have made them, as indeed it will be more difficult to sell. I know some high end designers brand just burn stuff to avoid depreciation, so these shoes might be burnt, which would be such a shame."

mov_AE1DA7483B024522125691AC26630E1B,2025-07-07 14:46:03,en,WEB,"  Designer Daniel Roseberry kicked off Paris Couture week with a collection that riffed on many of Schiaparelli's greatest hits. In the world of Schiaparelli creative director Daniel Roseberry, fashion and couture cross the line between art and performance, from the runway right down to the gilded, surrealist accessories. Such was the case for Schiaparelli's fall 2025 show, which took place during a rainy Parisian morning at the Petit Palais on July 7. The collection was comprised of white, black, red, and silver glamazons, plus lush fabrics that came in waves: cascading ruffles, sculpted bustiers that mirrored the Texan designer's horse saddles growing up, and silver sequin gowns laden with their own forms of chunky silver jewels. Using surrealism as the beginning thread, silhouettes were layered up in trompe l'oeil fantasies, from glimmering starburst motifs to metallized suits of shining, modern amor. Guests were sent a golden seashell pendant as an invitation to the show, which was titled “Back to the Future.” The whole concept of the collection surrounded this notion of past and present. There were tons of references to founder Elsa Schiaparelli's iconic designs, including a riff on the Apollo of Versailles cape the designer created in 1938. In the show notes, Roseberry compared the career legacies of Elsa Schiaparelli and Coco Chanel—two contemporaries and infamous rivals who each changed fashion, and the way women dress. “Chanel was interested in how clothes could be of practical use to women; Elsa was interested in what fashion could be,” Roseberry wrote. Courtesy of Schiaparelli Some of the most exciting pieces in the collection had a blink-and-you'll-miss-it, mesmerizing, textural effect. A floor-length red gown laced up the front had padding on the back; another was covered in a universe of mini paillettes. “I wanted there to be more tension this time,” Roseberry said of fall 2025 backstage. “A more electric vision, in a way. I didn't want it to be just beautiful.” The designer said he considers this collection part of a trilogy (including his most recent “Phoenix” and “Icarus” collections) and plans to restructure his creative process going forward. “It weirdly feels like there's something in the air, like we're on the precipice of something major. I'm not talking just geopolitical, but even in our own industry. This felt like a swan song, in a weird way. I wanted it to feel like a bit of a farewell. I want to rediscover and restructure everything.” One of the most influential parts of the collection was the mix of old and new, which Roseberry also discussed in the show notes by proposing a world without screens—no AI, no sacrificing history, nor an epic, archival fashion moment. It's a witty combination, from which the designer frequently pulls. “I don't want you guys to know what you're going to expect,” Roseberry added. “This is the kind of fashion that I grew up loving. Every season, it was a different character, a different manifesto, a different challenge to the eye—and sometimes it was not as successful as others.” Perhaps the greatest thing about today's couture is that one can't exist without the other: the old-world techniques are fed by technology. And as for those aforementioned creative changes, there's no doubt Roseberry will keep us guessing until the very end."

n1tmhet,2025-07-07 15:30:06,en,REDDIT,"  I think it's actually very simple: a house that predominantly produces perfume is considered to be niche, while brands that are predominantly produces clothing is considered to be designer. How it's used is a very different story, though; many brands don't even fit those two categories like Lush or Aesop. I personally use the term to describe brands with an avantgarde approach, for example Comme des Garçons (who actually are a clothing brand) while I struggle to call Xerjoff or Creed niche brands (because their perfumes are very mainstream to my nose). It's important to note that these terms have never been officially defined and in todays world, where brands like Xerjoff, Creed or Amouage are just as well known and popular like Dior and Chanel, they get more and more blurry."

For her shoot by Annie Leibovitz, Hathaway takes Burton's celebrated creations on a journey through New York City, including Central Park, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, and the Whitney Museum of American Art. While speaking with Maya Singer for her feature interview, Hathaway also chats about her new film Mother Mary, feeling like a “beginner” in her role as its titular pop star in crisis, and her new chapter of wide-ranging projects in the 2020's (which will also include new Princess Diaries and Devil Wears Prada sequels!) . “What struck me right away, reading the script, is that you can't 'perform' Mother Mary,” said Hathaway. “If I got the part, I would have to become material David could craft with. I had to submit to being a beginner. The humility of that—showing up every day knowing you're going to suck. And it has to be okay. You're not 'bad.' You're just a beginner. Getting to that mindset—I had to shed some things that were hard to shed. It was welcome. But it was hard, the way transformational experiences can be hard.” All images: Annie Leibovitz JW Anderson Steps Back From Runways—And Steps Into Home Design Jonathan Anderson's namesake JW Anderson brand is taking a break from the runway, According to Dazed, the beloved designer's eclectic label is stopping its seasonal runway shows and largely stepping back from releasing large fashion collections.

Email tips@dailymail.com Kaia Gerber and Lewis Pullman confirmed their seven month romance when enjoying quality time together in Los Angeles over the weekend. The 23-year-old model — who recently channeled mom Cindy Crawford — and 32-year-old actor were seen holding hands in public. They were seen in a park before stepping out to grab purple smoothies on Saturday. The lovebirds have been dating since January but have not been putting on public displays of affection until now. Gerber last dated Elvis actor Austin Butler. Gerber displayed her effortlessly cool off-duty style in a pair of cutoff denim shorts and shoulder-baring, midriff-flashing cropped T-shirt. She slung a midnight blue Chanel purse over her shoulder and rounded out the look with black ballet flats. For his part, the Thunderbolts star wore gray shorts with a frayed hem, a Stone Cole T-shirt, and navy blue trucker hat. For the weekend outing, the American Horror Story actress pulled her glossy brunette locks back with a clip. She kept the Southern California sunshine out of her eyes with a pair of chic black sunglasses. Gerber's new beau is the son of Hollywood star Bill Pullman, making them both nepo babies as they each come from famous parents. In May she was spotted out with Lewis and his mom Tamara Hurwitz, proving their relationship could be a lasting one as she bonds with Pullman's family. Pullman's parents supported the actress at her play Evanston Salt Costs Climbing in March at LA's Matrix Theater. Gerber and Pullman were first spotted together in January as they cozied up at his birthday dinner at Salazar restaurant in Los Angeles. It came weeks after sources told TMZ that Kaia and ex-boyfriend Austin Butler had split after three years of dating. The Palm Royale star intentionally kept the start of her latest romance out of the public eye, according to an Us Weekly report. 'They started dating in early December [2024]. They kept it under wraps until the news of her and Austin's split came out. Kaia and Austin have been broken up since October. 'In early December, Kaia and Lewis started seriously hanging out and were seen all around LA, but mostly on the east side,' an insider revealed. In regards to how the new lovebirds were able to keep their relationship hidden, the source said that the actress 'would make sure to be in a hat' or disguise herself in other ways to go to 'their favorite restaurants, bars and clubs.' And when together, the pair would be 'holding hands and showing PDA,' with the insider adding, 'They were just frequenting crowds that didn't really know them.' Kaia and Lewis have 'known each other for a while now. They run in the same circle and have similar friend groups, and that's how they were introduced. Kaia likes that this relationship feels low-pressure and that Lewis is a very low-key guy.'"

Normally I'm ok with the cheap $10 hats and sunglasses on Amazon but I have a bigggg ole face and no nose bridge so it took me 35+ years and hundreds of pairs of cheap and designer sunglasses to finally find a pair of sunglasses that 1) doesn't fall down when I bend over and 2) frames my face well. I see countless articles saying all the designer brands buy from the same source so it doesn't matter where you buy but then after getting my Miu Miu sunglasses I realize they're the best of the best. . for me. Same thing for shoes I've tried cheap, mid and fancy like Dior and Chanel they're all ok then one day I discovered dear Frances and realize wowww high quality shoes that don't hurt your feet do exist!? Now I'm wondering if such a thing exists for hats? Am I really missing out or it's just marketing. so I see some fancy options like Eric Javits, Eugenia Kim and Gigi Burris?"

However, Soaps.com may receive a commission on orders placed through its retail links, and the retailer may receive certain auditable data for accounting purposes. Sophia's getting her pregnancy pad in place when Tate knocks on her bedroom door. “Tate! What are you doing here?” He's dropping off glow sticks to get her in the spirit of the 4th and ask how she's feeling. Sophia flinches back when he tries touching her stomach. Tate apologizes awkwardly, and Sophia makes up an excuse about getting sick of people touching her stomach. He heads out to watch fireworks after Sophia assures him she'll be fine. She gets on the phone with Melinda, who assures her their plan is still a go. Sophia thanks her and tells her the “temporary solution” is working. Melinda tells her that after the weekend, they should be good to go, which is a huge relief for Sophia. “You made a very smart decision, Sophia. The right decision.” She walks Sophia through the foster/adoption process for her son (who Javi and Leo have), and Sophia asks if she has time to write a letter yet. “You can do that,” Melinda says, telling her to send it to the fire station. They'll leave for Chicago after the weekend, and everything will be fine. Xander Tries Making Amends Cat and Felicity are having ice cream at a table in the square when Xander wanders over with the stuffed dog he didn't give Victoria — and gives it to Felicity. He wants to apologize for yelling at her about Sarah's allergic reaction. She calls him an “ableist jerk,” which Xander takes with aplomb, but Cat appreciates the gesture. More: Is Holly leaving Salem? Holly and Sarah are out for a Girls' Night, where the teen tells her aunt that she and Tate are back together. She also talks a bit about Paris, then spots Xander with Cat and tries pulling Sarah away. But Sarah says she can't avoid him forever. Felicity, meanwhile, takes the apology and offers a glow stick as a gift before she leaves. Sarah and Xander Fight Some More Xander wanders over to Sarah, who says his attempt at an apology was a nice gesture, which shocks him. She offers to take the stuffed dog (which Felicity said she was too old for) to the kids at the hospital. They talk a bit about how Victoria's been a bit more fragile and clingy lately, and Sarah admits that it may have something to do with Xander not being around as much anymore. They agree to have a “semi civil conversation” over dinner. Now? Sarah goes to let Holly know she can run off with Tate. The two settle into The Bistro and chat a bit about how Victoria's been, and Sarah shows Xander pictures of their daughter's toothpaste mishap. After thawing a bit, they agree they can't go on like this. Xander suggests an informal 50/50 arrangement, but Sarah worries about Victoria being with him alone. She knows he'd never lay a finger on Victoria, but she worries about Victoria learning the wrong things about right and wrong and dealing with anger. She needs him to tell her he's sorry about what he did to Philip. And promise he'll never do anything like that again. But Xander refuses to acknowledge anything, accusing Sarah of setting him up to get in trouble. He refuses to believe her when she promises she won't tell anyone, and things go back downhill fast between the two of them. “Well,” he sighs. “I guess we'll have to do this the hard way, then.” They fight over who's looking out for Victoria's best interests, then Sarah storms out — only for Melinda to wander in. Xander tells him it's time to resort to “those other measures we talked about.” Is Chad On to Cat? Chad's all dressed up at home, turning down Julie's invite to the 4th of July Salem Pops performance, admitting he doesn't like classical music. He runs off to the bakery for some treats for the kids, but someone's watching him leave outside. Julie talks to Hope on the phone about the necklace, where she's happy to hear it'll be back tomorrow. But Hope refuses to say who had it...."

The Blenheim is Mr. Winston and he is six months old. They have a great story. I lost my beautiful 10-year-old Adeline about three months ago to Cushing's disease. I got Coco when she was only 12 weeks old. So Adeline raised her. When she got sick, Coco stopped eating. She only wanted me to hold her or she would lie on the floor, looking around for Adeline to make sure she was still here. When we finally had to put Adeline down, Coco stopped eating altogether. The only way I could get any food in to her was by hand, feeding her raw wet food and even then she only take a few bites. That was when we decided we had to get her a brother or sister. We found a breeder in Melbourne Beach, who is the most wonderful person! When she heard the story, and we explained we didn't want to start with a new 12 week old infant, she told us she had a five month old Blenheim who she had planned on keeping for herself. I asked if we could come see her five month old and bring Coco with us. We live north of Orlando and made the hour and a half trip. And needless to say, we came home with that little Blenheim and we named him Mr. Winston. We are forever grateful to the breeder, Shannon at Majestic Cavaliers, for her trust in us to take home her baby! And now we have a happy doggy family once again. They have truly become best friends ! Here's a short video to show you how happy they are!"

Houston-based Drag University is “a free program that taught Black and Latino Texans not only how to lip sync and put together an outfit, but how to navigate life in a state that has long led the way in curtailing LGBTQ+ rights,” reports The Washington Post, which recently profiled Drag U and its participants. The eight students in this summer's session were “working-class queer people in their 20s and 30s who were trying to find meaning and power through drag,” the Post notes. They varied in other ways, however. Syca'Ru, an androgynous person, identifies as “a drag thing.” Berry Kay, a cisgender woman, sought to channel “the divine feminine.” Chloe Montgomery is a trans woman who had started estrogen treatment a year ago and found it enhanced her life greatly, but she wanted to find a community, which she found in Drag U. In addition to instruction from local organizers, they received some training from well-known drag performers, such as A'Keria Chanel Davenport from RuPaul's Drag Race and pageant queen Jazell Barbie Royale. They also got legal advice on name changes from a Harris County judge, Lillian Alexander. Ian L. Haddock, founder and executive director of the Normal Anomaly Initiative, which organized Drag U, acknowledged it's a hard time for LGBTQ+ organizations, what with Donald Trump's defunding of diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and opposition to drag and trans identities. Plus Texas legislators have introduced dozens of anti-LGBTQ+ bills this year, including one that would make transitioning a crime, which did not pass. But he wanted to make the program's graduation weekend all about celebration. For graduation, each student got $250 to spend on an outfit. Montgomery had already bought a $25 floral dress that she could barely afford on her $16.50 an hour wages, but she knew that was what she wanted to perform in for graduation. She lip-synched to Beyoncé's “Dance for You.” Afterward, recording a video about why drag is important to her, she said, “I am trying to find who I am. And in finding myself, I am able to become the most powerful version of myself, a version who is free, who is unapologetic. And that makes me feel great because the little version of myself was too afraid to be seen.” She also adopted the name Yamore. “Chloe Yamore means 'Chloe, I love you,'” she said in her recording. “I love you enough to go for it even though I'm afraid.” Emboldened by Drag U, she decided to come out as a woman at work and to her family and friends. She also wore her dress outside of Drag U for the first time."

1544646355856166_4216893718631403,2025-07-07 23:05:36,en,FACEBOOK,"  * Fashion Day * 👠🕴 – July 9th The idea of style and fashion has been around for centuries. Perhaps even when humans first began to wear clothes, the cave women would see who had the nicest-looking fur pelt! From Ancient Rome to Ancient Egypt, from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, fashion and dress have been a vital part of high society. Of course, royal courts in Europe were known for their high fashion influences, where the very wealthy and important people could show off their clothing made from luxurious fabrics, often adorned with exquisite laces or even jewels. When the first sewing machine was invented in 1790, this changed the way that fashion was created. It made fashion more affordable and accessible to the common person. By 1826, Englishman Charles Frederick Worth had founded his House of Worth in Paris, effectively becoming the first modern fashion designer in the world. The idea that people would wear fashion to express their own personal style, instead of simply their status, began developing in the mid-1800s. It was around this time that design houses began searching for artists that would help them create unique patterns for the garments they made. For many people, clothes started to become a “wordless communication” that helped to inform and relate with others. Paris would quickly become the place where some of the best fashion houses in the world would develop. Christian Dior, Coco Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Yves Saint Laurent and many other luxury fashion brands made their way in this hotbed of fashion. The industrial revolution brought about a way for fashion to move even more rapidly, and the advent of the internet has moved things along even more quickly into the modern day. Fashion Day's first occurrence was in 2016, seemingly founded by a grass-roots movement through social media. Some people have set out to make Fashion Day a public revolt against the fashion houses and corporations that drive fashion and, instead, allowing individuals to express themselves in whatever fashionable days they might like. Since its inception, Fashion Day has caught on and provided women and men, boys and girls with a fun way to celebrate their unique styles and show off their own ideas of what fashion means to them!

The Haute-Couture week begins in Paris on Monday and is again shaped by changes among the creative directors: inside. Schiaparelli traditionally opens the views. On the same day, the fashion shows of the houses Iris van Herpen – back after a year away – Georges Hobeika, Imane Ayissi, Rahul Mishra, Julie de Libran and Giambattista Valli. The highlight of this autumn/winter season 2025/26 is the farewell to Demna Gvasalia near Balenciaga. The 44-year-old Georgian designer presents his last collection for the French fashion house on Wednesday afternoon. After ten years at the top, the designer changes to the Italian luxury brand Gucci. Their weak performance is burdened by Kering's business, which both brands belong to. It is replaced by the Italian Pierpaolo Piccioli, who will present his first collection in October during the Paris Fashion Week. A farewell to a large tamam: In addition to an exhibition entitled “Balenciaga of Demna” in the Kering headquarters, the fashion house has been releasing the best looks on its Instagram account for a few days that the designer has designed in the past decade. On Wednesday evening, Glenn Martens also made his debut with Maison Margiela. In January he was appointed the successor to the British John Galliano. With this first fashion show, the Belgian designer marks the return of the French house to the skin-couture calendar. The last show under the Pont Alexandre III bridge in January 2024 was viewed by many as one of the most spectacular in recent years. The fashion houses Patou and Celine already showed their collections outside of the official calendar on Sunday. This served as an unofficial prelude to the haute couture week. Dior and Gaultier are missing On Tuesday, Chanel will be presenting a collection for the last time that was designed by the internal design studio. It has been the fifth collection since Virginie Viard's sudden departure in June 2024. The successor, the reserved and highly respected French-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy, will present his first collection in October. By Thursday, 27 fashion houses will present their creations, including Elie Saab, Armani Privé, Aelis, Viktor & Rolf, Adeline André and the Syrian Couturier Rami Al Ali, who has been added to the official calendar. Due to the change of creative directors: there are also some remarkable absences here this week. Dior is not there. After a much-noticed first fashion show during the Men's Fashion Week on June 27, Jonathan Anderson rises his first haute couture collection for January 2026. The 40-year-old Nordire was called to the head of the women's and skin couture collections from Dior in early June and replaced Maria Grazia Chiuri. Just a few weeks earlier, he had taken responsibility for the men's collection. He has been the first since Christian Dior to lead all three lines of the LVMH flagship fashion house. Jean Paul Gaultier is also missing. The Dutchman, Dutch Duran Lantink, who was appointed in April in April, will make his debut during the Fashion Week in October. Since retirement in 2020, designer Jean Paul Gaultier has left guest designers' management of his Haute-Couture collections: inside like Olivier Rousteins, Ludovic de Saint Sernin, Haider Ackermann and Irin Simone Rocha. The event ends with the fashion show by the Swiss Kevin Germanier. Not to be confused with the Paris Fashion Week, the Haute-Couture week takes place in January for summer and July for winter. It takes place exclusively in Paris because it is a French peculiarity in which unique, handmade pieces are presented. These creations are mainly intended for red carpets, large jet set events and galas. This article was used with digital tools translated.

From mukaish coats to the controversial Kohlapuri sandals, here's a round-up Paris and Milan Fashion Week Spring Summer 2026 made one thing very clear. Fashion's gaze is locked on India. Not the soft-focus version from a postcard or the usual token bindi or scarf. This time, it was more immersive. Textiles, embroidery, silhouettes, footwear, set design. India was threaded into the very core of the season. Okay, so this is not new Fashion has always turned to India for ideas. It is a long history dressed up as inspiration. For instance, Jean Paul Gaultier showed turbans, bindis, and sherwani jackets in his 2007 couture line. John Galliano pulled heavily from Mughal silhouettes during his Dior years. Karl Lagerfeld sent Chanel's Métiers d'Art to Mumbai back in 2012. The staging was theatrical. The embroidery was Indian. The credits were barely there. Dries Van Noten once said India was his textile dreamland. He was not alone. Fast fashion jumped in too. High street brands have churned out block prints, mirror work, paisley shawls, and even yoga pants with temple motifs. Little to no credit was given. Dior's shiny coat came at a cost One of the most talked-about pieces from Paris Fashion Week SS 26 came from Dior. A long silver coat, completely hand-embroidered using the Mukaish technique, shimmered its way into every major fashion feed. It was stunning. It also came with a story no one told. Mukaish is a painstaking craft that dates back to third-century Lucknow. It involves tiny flattened metal wires stitched into fabric, creating a constellation of dots that catch the light. Royalty once wore it. Today, barely a handful of skilled artisans still know how to make it right. That one Dior coat took twelve artisans over thirty days to finish. The coat's reported value was close to two hundred thousand dollars. But despite the effort and the heritage, the brand did not credit the embroidery technique or the artisans in the show notes. That silence drew instant heat from Indian designers, craft activists, and media. Prada's sandals were just not sandals Prada's menswear show in Milan SS26 made waves for all the wrong reasons. Among the slick tailoring and rich fabrics was a humble-looking sandal. Open-toe, flat sole, a leather toe-loop. Yes, we are talking about Kolhapuris. These are not just any shoes. They are traditional hand-made sandals crafted in Maharashtra for generations. They have been granted geographical indication status, which means their design is protected, legally linked to their region and community. Prada described them as “leather flat sandals.” That was it. No reference to Kolhapur. No mention of India. Nothing. The backlash was swift. The Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce raised formal concerns...."

Melansir Brasil de Fato, Sabtu (5/7/2025), investigasi yang dilakukan dalam kemitraan dengan Repórter Brasil ini menganalisis keputusan pengadilan, citra satelit, dan catatan pengiriman. Laporan ini juga meneliti rantai pasar di sektor tersebut untuk mengungkap jaringan pasokan kulit dari merek-merek, seperti Chanel, Balenciaga, dan Gucci. Menurut Earthsight, perusahaan pengepakan daging Brasil Frigol berada di dasar rantai produksi ini. Rumah pemotongan hewan tersebut diidentifikasi sebagai pembeli sapi yang dipelihara di tanah yang diembargo karena penebangan hutan, serta dari peternakan yang didirikan secara ilegal di Tanah Adat Apyterewa di São Félix do Xingu, negara bagian Pará Baca Juga: PSIM Kenalkan Bek Asal Argentina Franco Ramos Mingo, Ini Rekam Kariernya Studi tersebut menunjukkan bahwa hampir semua kulit yang diekspor dari Pará ke Eropa ditujukan ke Italia. Sebagian dari produk ini dibeli Conceria Cristina dan Faeda, perusahaan penyamakan kulit dari Veneto, Italia, tempat bahan tersebut diproses dan diberi merek baru sebagai ""kulit Italia."" Perusahaan-perusahaan ini memasok lusinan merek fesyen, otomotif, dan desain interior mewah. Selain Chanel, Balenciaga, dan Gucci, Conceria Cristina memasok kulit yang diperoleh di Brasil ke merek mewah Amerika Serikat (AS), Coach, yang menargetkan Generasi Z dan menjual tas dengan harga antara 340─686 dolar AS (sekitar Rp5,5 juta─Rp11,1 juta), yang dianggap ""mudah dijangkau"" di pasar barang mewah. Hubungan komersial antara Coach dan Conceria Cristina dikonfirmasi pada peneliti Earthsight oleh juru bicara dari perusahaan penyamakan kulit Italia. Investigasi tersebut menyoroti Durlicouros, eksportir terbesar dari Pará ke Eropa, sebagai pemasok utama bagi perusahaan-perusahaan Italia.

mov_4F6C592BFF74DF8E1465287FFC8DB698,2025-07-08 07:08:17,en,WEB,"  India, July 8 -- The runways at the Milan and Paris Fashion Weeks made one thing very clear: fashion's gaze is turned to India. Even as questions around appropriation arose, India was threaded firmly into the core of the season, from textiles and textures, right down to the models and set design. Fashion has always turned to India for ideas. It is a long history dressed up as inspiration. For instance, Jean Paul Gaultier showed turbans, bindis, and sherwani jackets in his 2007 couture line. John Galliano pulled heavily from Mughal silhouettes during his Dior years. Karl Lagerfeld sent Chanel's Metiers d'Art to Mumbai back in 2012. The staging was theatrical. The embroidery was Indian. The credits were barely there. Dries Van Noten once said India was his textile dreamland. He was not alone. Fast fashion jumped in too. High street brands have churned out block prints, mirror work, paisley shawls, and even yoga pants with temple motifs. Little to no credit was given. Dior served up Paris Fashion Week's most talked-about pieces: a shimmering, mukaish-embroidered long coat. This art form dates back to third-century Lucknow and involves flattened metal wires stitched into fabric. Once worn by royalty, the Dior version (valued at close to 1.72 lakh) took twelve artisans and over thirty days to finish. However, the brand did not credit the technique or the artisans involved in its show notes, drawing flak from Indian designers and craft activists. Prada's menswear show in Milan SS26 made waves for all the wrong reasons. Among the slick tailoring and rich fabrics was a humble-looking sandal. Open-toe, flat sole, a leather toe-loop. Yes, we are talking about Kolhapuris. These are not just any shoes. They are traditional hand-made sandals crafted in Maharashtra for generations. They have been granted geographical indication status, which means their design is protected, legally linked to their region and community. Prada described them as ""leather flat sandals."" That was it. No reference to Kolhapur. No mention of India. Nothing. The backlash was swift. The Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce raised formal concerns. Indian designers called it out. Eventually, Prada issued a letter acknowledging the sandals were inspired by India and said they were open to future dialogue with Indian artisans. While global brands were fumbling with credits, Kartik Research arrived in Paris and flipped the script. The Delhi-based label presented a travelogue-like collection, accompanied by a visual essay titled, How to Make It in India. The brand also finally forayed into womenswear amid serious buzz. From textiles to silhouettes, each piece told a story of Indian craftsmanship, ranging from handlooms to hand-weaving and dyeing. Surfaces also told a story of heritage, with Jaipur rugs covering every inch of the set. Pharrell Williams's second menswear show for Louis Vuitton was another moment where Indian craft played a leading role. The runway was staged on Paris's oldest bridge, which was transformed into a snakes and ladders board. The set was designed by Indian architect Bijoy Jain and built using Indian marble, stone, and wood. The soundtrack was created in collaboration with A R Rahman. Palm trees, crystal-studded trunks, elephant motifs, and even a miniature autorickshaw bag nodded to Indian and South Asian culture. This was not an abstract reference. Louis Vuitton clearly credited the designers, artists, and inspiration behind the show. India's fashion week footprint did not end at fabric or set designs - models from India took centre stage at some of the biggest showcases. Walking for Hermes was Nakul Bhardwaj, who made headlines last year as the first Indian on the Versace runway. Meanwhile, Jainil Mehta made waves at Louis Vuitton, Saurang Sharma (pictured left) brought his quiet power to Issey Miyake and Shubham Vaidkar appeared in Giorgio Armani's presentation...."

A3F9E9C981305A3AE0F3A722AFCDA246,2025-07-08 07:22:54,en,PRINT,"  Monday was designer window-shopping on St. Barts. Tuesday, hiking rugged Saba. Wednesday, the endless summer beaches of Anguilla. All without the crowds from massive cruise ships or the expense of privately chartered sailboats. Somewhere between them lie ferries, offering do-it-yourself island-hopping trips that explore the Caribbean, slow-travel style. In the Leeward Islands, the dual-nation island of Dutch St. Maarten and French St. Martin serves as a transportation hub, welcoming travelers to St. Maarten's busy Princess Juliana International Airport and offering connections to nearby destinations via ferry or flight. The ferry companies offer day trips to visitors on St. Maarten who find themselves tantalizingly close to chic St. Barts or spy distant Saba on the horizon. ''You can leave one island and get four or five stamps in your passport,'' said Malinda Hassell, the director of tourism for Saba, a Dutch Caribbean island. '' That's what makes this area unique.'' Testing the premise from a base in St. Maarten with my friend Anne Marie, I created my own spring cruise, ferrying to French St. Barts, mountainous Saba and beachy British Anguilla. Financially, it's hard to beat the value of a cruise. Itineraries in the Caribbean can be found from $100 a person a day, including food, lodging and island-to-island transportation. Still, cruise ships don't normally visit these small islands and I found the ferry rates comparable to other day trips offered on St. Maarten. Ferry passengers are required to carry passports, passing through customs and immigration in the destination, but not when returning to St. Maarten, where I rented an Airbnb for less than $200 a night, which was within walking distance of the ferries. Travelers with more time can turn the following D.I.Y. itinerary into a multi-night trip, using ferries to get from one island stay to the next and reaching destinations impossible to do as day trips, including St. Eustacius, St. Kitts and Nevis. Shopping and Shelling on St. Barts After a 45-minute trip on the Edge ferry, run by Aqua Mania Adventures from St. Maarten's Simpson Bay Resort Marina & Spa ($100 round trip), the captain offered his passengers a tip before helping them to shore. ''Do your shopping first, then go to the beach,'' he said. '' Everything closes between 1 and 3.'' Brand names like Hermès and Chanel on boutiques along the waterfront greeted us in Gustavia, the manicured capital of the French island. To see more of St. Barts would require a vehicle, but pedestrian-friendly Gustavia offered ample history, architecture, natural beauty and beaches to fill our six-hour port call. At the tourism office near the waterfront, we picked up a map and sightseeing advice, including a recommended bakery, Boulangerie Choisy, where we enjoyed crispy croissants (2.40 euros, or about $2.76) that defied the Caribbean humidity. Steep slopes hug Gustavia's harbor where Swedes, who held the island between 1784 and 1878, built a series of forts. Now mostly demolished, Fort Gustav III hosted a small botanic garden and a lighthouse, but it was the unparalleled views over the yacht-filled harbor that rewarded the uphill effort. Around the waterfront, signs identified historic buildings, creating a D.I.Y. architectural trail. Swedish rule as a place of free trade accommodated many nationalities and religions, which led to the 1855 opening of St. Bartholomew's Anglican Church, faced in French limestone with volcanic rock corners. It shared the neighborhood with 19th-century merchant houses with stone foundations and shingle roofs. We wound up at Shell Beach, a tranquil cove piled in seashells just a few minutes' walk from the harbor. At the entrance, the beachside restaurant Shellona offered sunbeds at 80 euros, and turned away diners without reservations. Down the shore, we dumped our daypacks among some boulders and swam among puffers, jacks and schools of blue tang. Afterward, we watched a model make a fashion runway of the sand, coming and going from a nearby boutique in a series of resort looks. Returning to the harbor, we stopped for a tuna baguette sandwich (? 6.90) at Patisserie Carambole bakery and a Red Stripe lager at the stylishly scruffy harbor bar Le Select (? 5), congratulating ourselves for enjoying Gustavia for under $20 each. Summiting Saba The 62-passenger ferry Edge also travels to Saba twice a week ($100 round-trip). The longer ride -- 90 minutes one way -- convinced Anne Marie, who is prone to seasickness, to enjoy a beach day on St. Maarten. Unlike other islands that sell themselves on sunshine and beaches, Saba appeals to hikers, snorkelers and divers. The highest peak of the five-square-mile island, 28 miles southwest of St. Maarten, was ringed in clouds. Given the logistics of getting around steep Saba, with one main road and four main villages, I signed up for a package from Aqua Mania, which offers self-guided hiking trips and guided island tours (both $160, including lunch). Footwear gave each passenger's plan away, distinguishing those in hiking boots from the sandal-clad. Leaping beside the ferry, flying fish led the way to Saba, which has no permanent beaches and only one landing site. Gradually, its imposing cliff walls came into view, a sheer rock base supporting a highland rainforest. At the tiny port, after passing through immigration, I found my assigned taxi driver and shared a lift to the trailhead for Mount Scenery, with a couple from Ontario. Just outside of the hilly town of Windwardside, where we picked up a packed lunch from Tropics Café, the trail marker promised precisely 1,064 steps up to Mount Scenery, the highest point in the Netherlands at 2,877 feet. A stone staircase with handrails in slippery spots began in a dark tropical jungle and ascended into a wetter, brighter cloud forest where hummingbirds zoomed from branch to branch. Zebra longwing butterflies drifted among vining black-eyed susans, Saba's national flower, and verdant foliage. After the long, sweaty climb, I arrived at the summit, socked in by clouds, and enjoyed a turkey sandwich with the appetite of the exhausted but exhilarated. The round-trip hike took just over two hours, leaving me time to walk around Windwardside to appreciate its tidy white-washed cottages with green trim and red tin roofs lining perilously steep streets. A few other ferry passengers were also poking around, trying local Deep Dive Brewing Co. beer, lunching poolside at Tropics Café and perusing Five Square Art Gallery...."

Just be sure to shop these — and other can't-miss markdowns — fast before they fly off the virtual shelves. Crest Talk about a deal worth smiling about. Crest Whitestrips have racked up thousands of glowing reviews from shoppers, celebs and our own staff. “[They're] effective, budget-friendly and easy to use on the go,” Erin Andrews told Page Six Style last year, while Chrishell Stause once told E! that they're “quick and easy.” “They definitely work — as well as a professional whitening treatment, in my experience,” adds Page Six Style & Shopping Director Elana Fishman. “And importantly, my dentist told me they're totally safe to use as an alternative.” Laneige Stars' love of this before-bed beauty product isn't just lip service. Kate Hudson's so obsessed she told British Vogue she wishes she'd invented the stuff herself, while Brooke Shields, Kyle Richards and Kendall Jenner (to name but a few) have all name-dropped it over the years. We were equally impressed when we put it to the test, with Style & Shopping Director Elana declaring it “a classic for a reason.” Soko Glam This TikTok favorite took off at the opposite of a snail's pace. Emily Ratajkowski posted an Instagram Story about it, while Alex Cooper used it to get wedding-ready and Ariana Madix discovered from her boyfriend. “I became addicted to it … it feels really nice,” the “Love Island USA” host told the Strategist last year. Biodance Another K-beauty buy that's caught on in record time? Biodance's collagen masks, which have earned famous fans like Paige DeSorbo, Ciara Miller and Kyle Richards. “Recently these have been my go-to; I've gotten all my friends into them,” DeSorbo said in a 2025 Amazon Live of the “amazing” masks, which turn clear once your skin has absorbed all of the product. L'Oréal Paris L'Oréal's True Match line and A-listers just might be a match made in heaven. Martha Stewart's mak,eup artist Daisy Toye, told us she's “obsessed” with using this glow-boosting lotion on her famous client, while Bethenny Frankel used it to get ready for the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Runway Show this spring. “It's lightweight and it's not sticky at all so it doesn't get all over everything,” she said of the “supermodel glow” secret in a behind-the-scenes Instagram video. BioOil Frankel's TikTok favorite also include this practical multipurpose oil, which she told followers to “run like a thief” to purchase. “The thing is, when you put it on your body, face and hair, it hydrates and it lasts,” she shared. “Like, your legs still have a nice sheen hours later. It's extremely healing, it's reasonable [price-wise] and it has a subtle fragrance.” Wella Madison LeCroy — who worked as a hairstylist before joining the cast of “Southern Charm” — loves this “miracle” product so much, she owns at least three bottles so she's never without it. “So good … definitely one of my top five products,” she raved in a recent Amazon Live, holding up two nearly-empty full-sized bottles, plus a mini version “for travel.” Clarins While Kate Middleton's rarely seen applying products in public, she pulled this sheer pink gloss out of her purse at the 2019 Wimbledon championships.

As the first show to officially kick off Paris Couture Week, all eyes were drawn to Schiaparelli – a House forever balancing surrealism and elegance. Celebrities arrived in waves: Dua Lipa, Cardi B, Hunter Schafer, each wearing iconic creations like a manifesto. Outside, a relentless storm of cameras flashed incessantly, transforming the fashion show ambiance into one of a rock and roll concert. Inside, the charged atmosphere promised more than just a collection; it promised a journey through time. The collection's title, Back to the Future, couldn't have been more fitting. It's a reflection on a pivotal moment in fashion history – June 1940, when Elsa Schiaparelli left Paris, her beloved city, for New York, marking the end of an era that redefined fashion itself. Elsa's contribution was revolutionary not just for what she created, but for what she questioned: What is fashion? Could a dress transcend mere clothing to become art? While contemporaries like Gabrielle Chanel transformed how women dressed by liberating them from the corset, Elsa's vision was conceptual, surreal, and unbound by practicality. Image courtesy of Schiaparelli Daniel Roseberry, Schiaparelli's visionary creative director, channels this spirit by stripping the collection of colour and modern distractions. Deprived of the familiar cues of modernity – no colour, no technology, no screens – the pieces feel elemental and raw, yet astonishingly futuristic. This is an audacious leap into a “post-future” world where past and future blur and fashion exists purely as art and emotion. Silhouettes evolve here. Gone are the emblematic corsets, replaced by a fresh exploration of shape and structure; saddle-shaped shoulders recur throughout, inviting the wearer into a new dialogue with form. This collection pushes you to see shapes and the body itself differently, to experience fashion as a living sculpture. Craftsmanship remains paramount. Silver-embroidered palm trees and animal motifs from archival sketches adorn tailored black wool jackets. The iconic Elsa jacket returns, sharp-shouldered and reimagined in both cut and fabric, alongside bias-cut evening gowns that speak a new language of ease without corsetry. The textures – Donegal wool, satin, tulle, velvet – create a surreal trompe l'oeil that plays with light and shadow. Image courtesy of Schiaparelli And then there are the fantastical highlights: the legendary Apollo cape reimagined as layers of diamanté starbursts in shades of black and gunmetal; matador-inspired jackets encrusted with pearls and metallic leopard spots; and the unforgettable Eyes Wide Open dress embroidered with hand-painted irises framed in resin cabochons, its silk tulle back flowing like a dream. This is a collection dedicated to the twilight of an era – a moment when the elegance of a golden age collided with the ominous shadows of war. It reminds us that looking backward only holds meaning if it fuels the future. As the last model made her exit, the Petit Palais erupted into a flurry of flashing cameras and hushed awe. The grand staircase outside became a sea of photographers and celebrities, their excitement a tangible echo of the energy created by the collection. Rewatch the show"

The Monegasque royal's presence at Paris Fashion Week underscored a legacy of style and a family connection to the fashion house, all while evoking the enduring memory of Hollywood's ultimate princess. As Casiraghi, a long-time Chanel ambassador, attended the event, the resemblance between Casiraghi and Princess Grace was undeniable, a tribute to a star who traded the silver screen for a real-life fairy tale. Charlotte Casiraghi poses upon arrival ahead of the Chanel's Haute-Couture Fall/Winter 2025-26 collection show in Paris on July 8, 2025. (Photo by Thomas SAMSON / AFP) (Photo by THOMAS SAMSON/AFP via ) While Casiraghi carries the torch of Monegasque glamour, the story begins with her legendary grandmother. Before she was Her Serene Highness Princess Grace of Monaco, she was Grace Kelly, one of Hollywood's most luminous stars. In a brief but brilliant acting career that spanned just five years, Kelly captivated audiences and critics alike. She starred opposite Gary Cooper in High Noon (1952) and earned her first Academy Award nomination for Mogambo (1953), where she shared the screen with Clark Gable and Ava Gardner. Her collaboration with director Alfred Hitchcock solidified her status as a cinematic icon, starring in the classics Dial M for Murder (1954), Rear Window (1954), and To Catch a Thief (1955). It was for her transformative role in The Country Girl (1954) that she won the Oscar for Best Actress, cementing her place among Hollywood royalty. At the height of her fame in 1956, Kelly retired from acting at the age of 26 to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco. The ""Wedding of the Century"" transformed the movie star into a real-life princess, a role she embraced with dedication and grace. As Princess of Monaco, she became a devoted wife and mother to their three children—Caroline, Albert, and Stéphanie. She championed numerous philanthropic causes, including her work with the Red Cross and her establishment of the Princess Grace Foundation to support emerging artists."

Tapi justru karena statusnya sebagai pionir, integritasnya harus tanpa cela. Jangan sampai pencapaian ini menciptakan preseden yang keliru,” tegas Hardjuno dalam pernyataan tertulisnya di Jakarta, Selasa (8/7). Sebagai informasi, COIN adalah perusahaan induk dari dua entitas penting dalam industri kripto Indonesia—bursa kripto CFX dan kustodian aset digital ICC—yang disebut-sebut sebagai yang pertama dan satu-satunya di Indonesia saat ini. IPO COIN sendiri telah mengalami kelebihan permintaan (oversubscribe) hingga lebih dari 70 kali lipat dengan lebih dari 100 ribu calon investor ikut serta. Baca Juga: Dapat Siswa 8 Rombel Tahun Ajaran 2025/2026, SMP Muhi Yogya Gelar Raker Meski begitu, publik juga tengah menyoroti profil salah satu pihak yang diduga memiliki pengaruh signifikan dalam COIN, yakni Andrew Hidayat. Namanya disebut dalam prospektus IPO sebagai bagian dari pemilik manfaat utama (Ultimate Beneficial Owner/UBO) bersama beberapa tokoh lainnya. Andrew sendiri diketahui pernah divonis dua tahun penjara oleh pengadilan tindak pidana korupsi pada tahun 2015, dalam kasus suap perizinan tambang batu bara yang juga menyeret anggota DPR saat itu. Tak hanya itu, Andrew juga diduga terlibat dalam kontroversi penetapan pemenang tender atas aset sitaan negara dalam perkara Jiwasraya, yakni tambang milik PT GBU yang dibeli oleh PT Indobara Utama Mandiri (IUM). Perusahaan ini disebut-sebut sebagai milik Andrew, meskipun hal tersebut belum diklarifikasi secara terbuka oleh pihak yang bersangkutan. Namun demikian, dalam pernyataan resmi yang disampaikan kepada media, pihak COIN menyatakan bahwa Andrew Hidayat bukanlah pemilik manfaat akhir (UBO) dari perusahaan. Klarifikasi ini menjadi bagian penting dalam menjawab kekhawatiran publik, meskipun Hardjuno menilai bahwa status formal kepemilikan tidak boleh mengaburkan kebutuhan akan integritas personal dan rekam jejak dalam proses IPO.

Pasar modal adalah institusi kepercayaan, dan calon emiten harus bersih tidak hanya dari sisi laporan keuangan, tapi juga dari aspek governance,” ujarnya. Ia menambahkan bahwa regulasi seperti Peraturan BAPPEBTI No. 8 Tahun 2021 memang tidak menyebut secara eksplisit pelarangan bagi individu dengan catatan pidana ekonomi untuk mendirikan perusahaan kripto. Namun, semangat regulasi tersebut jelas mendorong transparansi, perlindungan investor, dan tata kelola yang sehat. “Ini soal membangun ekosistem jangka panjang. Jika saat ini kita membiarkan pihak-pihak dengan latar belakang yang diduga bermasalah masuk ke dalam sistem, bagaimana kita bisa membangun kepercayaan terhadap pasar aset digital Indonesia?” ujarnya.

Ia menyinggung kasus BitMEX di Amerika Serikat, di mana para pendirinya harus menjalani hukuman pidana karena pelanggaran anti pencucian uang. Ia juga menyebut kasus Thodex di Turki, di mana pendirinya kabur bersama miliaran dolar dana investor sebelum akhirnya dijatuhi vonis lebih dari 11 ribu tahun penjara.  "

Models emerged from an ornate entrance, parading long- skirted dresses in soft toned tweeds, with touches of sparkles and tufts of feathers. They wore tight buns and tall boots, which left u-shaped heel indentations in the plush carpet. Colors were muted, mostly ivory, beige and brown, but one silky dress came in a pale silvery blue, worn under a short, yellow-toned bomber jacket with a prominent, feathery collar. The show was held in the Salon d'Honneur, a smaller space of the freshly-restored Grand Palais, marking a contrast with the soaring, central exhibition hall usually favored by the label. Facing a prolonged slump, many labels in the high end fashion industry are renewing their design approach, with Kering-owned Gucci and Balenciaga, and LVMH's Dior among labels that have recently named new designers. After the show, guests lingered, making their way slowly down grand staircases, stopping for photos of the building's elaborate ironwork and gilded wall decorations. The Paris fall-winter haute couture fashion shows run through Thursday, featuring runway outings from labels Schiaparelli, Iris van Herpen and Imane Ayissi, as well as Giorgio Armani Prive, Maison Margiela and Balenciaga.

It's clear that this haute couture collection embodied its founder's ethos, presenting a subdued collection in pared-back, earthy tones. This autumn/winter 2025-26 show was inspired by the autumn harvest – symbolic of bounty, renewal and transition. It was the last to be designed by the Chanel Design Studio, which worked with Karl Lagerfeld and Virginie Viard – Chanel's former creative directors. In October, the fashion house will begin a new cycle, when its new creative director Matthieu Blazy will debut his collection in Paris at spring/summer 2026 Fashion Week. Sitting front row to observe this final farewell to Chanel's Design Studio was Gracie Abrams, wearing a white tiered dress from the label's Resort 2026 Collection, Kirsten Dunst, Keira Knightley, Sofia Coppola with her rarely-seen daughters Romy and Cosima, and Penelope Cruz. For the show, pieces were set against a backdrop inspired by the original haute couture salons where Gabrielle Chanel first championed pared-back elegance, the collection unfolded in a palette of earthy neutrals – ecru, ivory, moss green, chocolate brown and inky black. Wheat, a long-standing symbol of prosperity cherished by the founder herself, appeared as a recurring motif throughout – reimagined as jewelled buttons and intricate embroidery, showcasing the exquisite craftsmanship of the Chanel ateliers. When Chanel first launched her designs in 1910, they were shockingly avant-garde, dressing women in wide-leg trousers, cardigan jackets, striped Breton tops, turbans and turtlenecks. It was, at the time, outrageous. Today however, Chanel is considered to be the most timeless – and perhaps the 'safest' – of heritage labels. But this approach isn't a bad thing, particularly with haute couture, which is about extraordinary handwork, embroidery, feather work and the like – aspects that are innate in the biology of Chanel. This collection remained true to its heritage, presenting iconic pieces reimagined into symbols of nature – from white bird feathers to the ears of wheat sewn to the sleeves of Chanel bouclé. The Chanel tweed suit isn't the easiest canon to work in – it can so easily go lumpy and stodgy. This collection neatly avoided the problem, adding fringe, fluffy feathers, tassels and rich layering. Longer skirts and dresses flowed elegantly over knee-high boots, while leather textures brought an edge to the otherwise calm collection. The show was a quiet farewell from the silent studio that have been the brains behind the last three collections, while at the same time, it was a look at the label's exciting future. All eyes now turn to Matthieu Blazy, who will inherit the house's storied codes and bring them into a new chapter for a budding spring collection."

He's now on his third act, opening an actual restaurant, targeting a September opening. “We're thinking of Charm as a supper club for the rest of us,” Milazzo said in a press release. “No membership fees. No celebs. Just a place to tuck in, put your elbows up, and befriend the bartenders.” Sourdough pizza will, of course, continue to play a role, but the menu will also veer into other childhood favorites, like a riff on the Bloomin' Onion and chicken nuggets. Third Time's the Charm is joined by partner Sean Klim (who was in the kitchen at Bad Cholesterol and chef Sam Savage (who also worked on the pop-up). It replaces what was operator Erin Norris' longtime restaurant Grindhaus, there since 2013, and which had more recently rebranded to OurHaus, at 275 Van Brunt Street, near Visitation Place, in Brooklyn. This Williamsburg diner will be torn down Shame on Williamsburg developer Yoel Schwimmer, who will tear down the last-of-its-kind diner storefront at 221 Wythe Avenue, in the process of turning the lot into a mixed-use building, Crain's New York reports. It's a fate this space has long been waiting for. What was once Wythe Diner has been vacant for years, but it was an architectural feat with its standalone structure in a neighborhood dominated by a sea of new towers. We held out hope that another restaurant would eventually reopen there: From 1997 until 2010, it was a restaurant called Relish. In 2011, Cafe de La Esquina opened before shutting in 2018. Then, as these things go, Blank Street Coffee ran an outdoor coffee cart in the backyard in 2020. In 2023, lights were turned on again by a limited-run activation by Chanel, symbolizing the way the neighborhood is getting gentrified into a luxury district. Large dumpling chain lands in Manhattan Originating in China, with 800 locations abroad, Dumpling Xi has added a second location in New York, on the heels of a Flushing debut a couple of months ago. Now, Dumpling Xi — which originated in Hegang, Heilongjiang, in 2002 — has opened at 71 Fourth Avenue, at East 10th Street, in the East Village. A menu includes dumplings with fillings like zucchini-egg-fried-shrimp, shrimp-fish-roe, and pork-celery. When Soeun, the SoHo macrobiotic restaurant, closed in 2019 after first opening in 1971, it prompted public outcry. Following the closing of Lola Taverna, the most recent tenant in the space, a tacky Greek clubstaurant, actress Chloë Sevigny posted on Instagram stories this week asking, “If anyone had a lifeline to bring back Soeun.” For what it's worth, there's still a Soeun in the East Village, but it's not the same."

On Tuesday, as the house marked 110 years of its haute couture — a century and more of Coco Chanel's revolution in how women dress — it recreated its atelier inside the freshly restored Grand Palais, turning intimacy into spectacle for a nature-drenched show at Paris Couture Week. Chanel, whose founder banished corsets and reimagined luxury as liberation, showed just how far that legacy stretches: from the tiny salons of 1915 to its modern colossus. It was a flex only a handful of luxury giants could pull off — and perhaps, as one front-row guest suggested, a dazzling distraction as the fashion world counts down to the debut of Chanel's new designer Matthieu Blazy. Penélope Cruz, Naomi Campbell and the house's tightest VIP circle scaled gilded steps, sweating past marble and gold, to enter the reconstructed atelier. The set by Willo Perron was classic Chanel: intimate yet monumental, old world yet futuristic. “It just felt special,” Campbell said, “like stepping into a memory and something completely new. There's warmth, intimacy, nostalgia. Chanel can recreate anything, and it works."" Chanel goes country More drama unfolded on the runway. This was couture as nature fantasy, filtered through the Chanel prism. Menswear tailoring added swing to sculpted jackets and coatdresses, while mohair suits in deep greens and plums channeled autumn's hush. Bouclé tweeds mimicked sheepskin; feathers and tweed created illusionary faux fur. Gold-sprayed wheat ears — the house symbol of abundance — were everywhere: stitched into flounces, embroidered on necklines, set on every guest's seat. The theme may have been country, but make no mistake: This was as close as Chanel gets to “roughing it.” Technique dazzled at every turn: jewel-buttons, embroidered florals and a finale of lamé so luminous it mimicked sunlight on harvest fields. The studio team, holding the fort after Virginie Viard's abrupt and unceremonious exit last year, anchored the show in classic codes but played with wit and lightness. That obsessive handwork matters — not just for tradition, but for business. Chanel is fashion's juggernaut: Privately held, the brand reported $18.7 billion in revenue for 2024, cementing its status as one of the world's most powerful luxury houses. Couture may be the crown, but its influence drives global sales in fragrance, bags and jewelry, making it the envy of rivals. New era for the luxury giant Change is always looming at Chanel. For more than 30 years, Karl Lagerfeld transformed the brand from Parisian legend to pop phenomenon, staging ever-grander spectacles at the Grand Palais. After his death in 2019, Viard, his longtime deputy, guided Chanel into a softer, more discreet era. Now the industry is holding its breath for Blazy, a Belgian talent with stints at Margiela, Celine and most recently Bottega Veneta, where he won fans for his blend of innovation and reverence for craft. Campbell said of Blazy, whom she knows personally: “He's focused, open-minded — he'll bring something special.” Tuesday's show unfolded inside the Grand Palais' newly restored Salon d'Honneur, its gold and stone revealed after a 600-million-euro, multi-year restoration co-funded by Chanel.

mov_F57072BB08BECEA6BE9259D57555B0C3,2025-07-08 14:00:00,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]Sono complessivamente 27 le collezioni presentate in questa nuova tornata dell'alta moda per l'A/I 2025-6, in lieve calo rispetto all'edizione precedente. Ma non è questo l'essenziale. Essenziale è capire quale sia il ruolo di questi defilé nella situazione in cui si trova il cosiddetto “lusso” in questo momento.  Moda e beauty: il caso Hermès   Un tempo (non molto tempo fa) ci eravamo convinti che il fulgore degli abiti couture portati in passerella (numericamente limitati quanto a possibili vendite) fosse utile a far risplendere altri prodotti di cui i brand si sono fatti latori. In particolare, quelli del settore bellezza che per anni ha sostenuto i fatturati e allargato la brand awareness di ogni marchio. Valga un esempio per tutti. Anche Hermès , a cui si attribuisce una consolidata prudenza nelle politiche commerciali, a partire dal 2020 ha costruito un'apposita divisione beauty, allargando la proposta dalla celebre Eau d'Hermès (1951), evolutasi via via in altre fragranze di successo come Terre d'Hermes (2007) sino a comprendere make-up e skin care di fascia alta. Nel 2024 risulta che dalla divisione beauty Hermès abbia ricavato circa 15,2 miliardi di euro, il 3,5% dei ricavi  totali. Nello stesso anno i vertici di Hermès annunciavano di voler debuttare con una collezione anche nella couture. Quando: forse nel 2026? o nel 2027? È ora però lecito chiedersi se avverrà davvero, visto il quadro di riferimento che per tutti, è profondamente cambiato.  1 / 3   Hermès terre d'Hermès @Hermes      2 / 3   Profumi di Jean Paul Gaultier by Puig @puig      3 / 3   Tom Ford Solei Summer collection by Estée lauder @tomford                    I numeri del beauty   Accade in questo 2025 che anche i fatturati delle divisioni beauty dei più celebri marchi, esattamente come quelli del tessile o della pelletteria abbiano assunto un profilo simile a quello delle montagne russe tipico dei grafici di borsa nei momenti di maggiore incertezza. Lo sa persino Donald Trump ( non è una fake ) che di recente ha lanciato una promozione che fa risparmiare 100 $ a chi acquista due flaconi delle fragranze che portano il suo nome, in vendita separatamente a 249. Lo sanno molto bene i francesi di L'Oréal come gli americani di Estée Lauder e gli spagnoli di Puig (gli ultimi due gruppi nati nella cosmesi e profumeria ma poi capaci di acquisire brand moda come Tom Ford, Dries van Noten o Jean Paul Gaultier). Il marketing tradizionale, quello basato su spinte trasversali tra abbigliamento e profumo, accessorio e crema anti-age, non sembra più sufficiente. I consumatori sono sempre meno prevedibili: quando è esploso il fenomeno (tossico) intergenerazionale e del dimagrante Ozempic negli USA a beneficiarne è stato un colosso industriale che con il beauty non ha mai avuto relazioni. Nessun addetto ai lavori si era sino a quel momento curato della produzione della Novo Nordisk, un gigante della farmaceutica danese.  Fragranze uomo e donna Trump Victory 45-47 @trumpfragrance Un nuovo significato della parola “lusso”   Non sono solo dunque situazioni clamorose come dazi e guerre a creare scompiglio. È Il sentiment dei consumatori ad essere cambiato: il vocabolo “ lusso ” non ha più lo stesso significato di una volta. Di questo proviamo a ragionare ora. Il protrarsi della recessione per il tipo di merceologie che comprende si deve al dubbio ormai dilagante circa il loro reale valore.  Ridurre i prezzi e migliorare la sostenibilità/etica  delle produzioni: queste sono le richieste a che vengono fatte in questo momento da chi dovrebbe acquistare “lusso”. Solo dopo arriva quella di proporre idee più creative . Negli ultimi cinque anni, l'impennata dei prezzi se ha inizialmente contribuito ad aumentare i margini di profitto dei gruppi ha poi messo fuori gioco un cospicuo numero di acquirenti che, anche per reazione, mettono ora in discussione quel che prima sembrava indiscutibile. Gen Z e Millennial ora si dispongono in modalità acquisto solo dopo aver svolto ricerche in proprio affidandosi al web (TikTok, piattaforme specializzate, UGC), guardano con favore a pop-up esperienziali e gradiscono i touchpoint che intrecciano prodotti e ospitalità: la dinamica verticale della novità che cala dal “creatore-vate” al “consumatore-credente” ha fatto il suo tempo.  Moda 2025 La questione della sostenibilità   Resta inoltre aperto il terribile problema della sostenibilità . Particolarmente sentito da Millennial e GenZ (questi ultimi in particolare), ma di rimbalzo, tornato di interesse anche tra i Boomer, che resta la generazione con maggiori disponibilità economiche: a questi ultimi i gruppi del lusso hanno ripreso a guardare con attenzione, avviando nuove operazioni di marketing intergenerazionale. Non si può dire in ogni caso che tutte le azioni di contrasto intraprese dai brand del lusso siano solo greenwashing. Se una superstar del lusso come Chanel lancia un progetto come Neverold per riutilizzo dei tessuti destinati alle discariche, persino il fast fashion prova ad attrezzarsi: H&M  group, dopo Inditex il più potente in questo segmento di mercato, ha firmato di recente un accordo pluriennale con Renewcell, il produttore di materiali di nuova generazione Circulose , con l'obiettivo di sostituire una “quota sostanziale” della viscosa utilizzata nei suoi marchi (H&M, Cos, Weekday e Arket) con alternative provenienti da prodotti di riciclo.  1 / 2   Proposta Temu dal prezzo imbattibile      2 / 2   Prodotti Shein pronti per la spedizione                 Oltre il fast fashion, c'è l'ultra-fast fashion   Va meglio dunque? Non proprio: Shein la piattaforma di e-commerce di origine cinese che ha adottato il modello ultra-fast fashion sta dilagando anche in Europa, dove introduce prodotti che sono l'esatto contrario del dovuto. Il design è pirata, ma è soprattutto la qualità scadente dei materiali (alcuni di recente segnalati come tossici) e le condizioni di lavoro che con un eufemismo possiamo definire “discutibili” a preoccupare. Perché tanto interesse intorno a Shein e al suo omologo Temu ? ll fattore prezzo è imbattibile: pochi euro, spedizione inclusa, per qualsiasi pezzo base di qualsivoglia guardaroba. All'apparenza (sullo schermo di un pc o cellulare) non dissimile persino da proposte di alta gamma. A complicare il tutto c'è l'assottigliarsi reale o percepito dei confini di Haute Couture, Prêt-à-porter, fast fashion e ultra-fast fashion. Vale per gli schermi su cui acquistiamo ma vale pure per le vetrine delle megalopoli del pianeta.   Aldo Premoli     Libri consigliati:   Vestire buono, pulito e giusto.

Now, the three-time Grammy winner is taking a similar leap, stepping into the spotlight solo for his own one-man show tour. The intimate tour called No Bandwidth will pull back the curtain on Saadiq's life and music, weaving never-before-told stories with performances spanning Tony! Toni! Toné! , Lucy Pearl and his solo catalog. The tour kicks off in Sacramento on Sept. 7, marking a return to the stage that began with a recent limited four-city sneak peek in New York, Los Angeles and his hometown of Oakland. Music Review: English post-punks Wet Leg level up on sophomore album, 'Moisturizer' A few songs into the second studio album from buzzy English post-punks Wet Leg, singer Rhian Teasdale yells “level up!” And level up they have. The alt-rock group took their time to complete their sophomore release, titled “Moisturizer.” It was worth the wait, says The Associated Press' Jim Pollock in his review. The album is a terrific soundtrack for a long, hot summer. The band's sound is built on Teasdale's deadpan delivery and guitarist Heather Chambers' chunky, jagged bursts. On “Moisturizer,” they have greatly expanded their skills and range. But they have also retained the raunchy, goofy energy that gained them an adoring audience in the first place. Oprah Winfrey's latest book club pick, 'Culpability,' delves into AI ethics NEW YORK (AP) — Oprah Winfrey has selected Bruce Holsinger's novel ""Culpability"" as her latest book club pick.

Holsinger, an English professor at the University of Virginia, expressed gratitude for the honor, noting his long admiration for Winfrey's book club. The announcement continues Winfrey's partnership with Starbucks. Her interview with Holsinger was filmed at a Starbucks in Seattle. It's available on her YouTube channel and podcast platforms.

Fura sokk lehet az mára, hogy a lakhelyeink bár a sírok, írok. Nyilván tudja, megírtam a nem kis afférunknak ama setét hetét. Korábban azt hitte talán, ön a líra dicső falán irály király, ám a remek versem óta, önről gúnnyal szól a nóta: „Agya ragya!” Professzor úr, ön mára már csupán megszánandó szamár; Iááá-t kiá't. Nép, ki nincs még fedve hanttal, meghallva a Horger Antal nevet, nevet. Hibás ebben bár a danám, hazudnék, ha azt mondanám, szánom, bánom. Öntől lettem majdnem nulla, s lett ön gyalázásom hulla- -dékán dékán. Mindegy most már, megbocsátok, s árkot, mely volt egykor átok, betem- -etem. „Lassan harminckétezred napja nem eszek, se sokat, se keveset, úgyhogy hiába forgatnak itt a síromban, nincs mit kihányjak, pedig ez a Frady megérdemelne egy dózist pacekba!” /József Attila (1905-1937), költő/ „Ez a költemény egyfajta posztumusz hadüzenet a magyar irodalomtörténet egyik legismertebb tanári pofonja felé. Frady Endre újraírja József Attila „Születésnapomra” ihlette dacos hangját, de nem csupán átveszi, hanem groteszk köpenybe burkolja a régi sérelmet. A vers formai játéka frappáns: minden versszak második sora a rímpár első tagját elharapja, így adva sajátos, szinte gyerekdal-szerű zökkenést a szövegnek — ami épp ezt az éretlenül is éles vádat hangsúlyozza. A hangnem szándékosan infantilis („Iááá-t / kiá't”), de a szatíra mögött jól érzékelhető egy szorongó bosszúvágy irodalmi feldolgozása. A „professzor úr” ironikus piedesztálra emelése, majd onnan való lezuhanása egyre groteszkebb képeket szül: „gyalázásom hulla- / -dékán / dékán” – ez a rím nem is csupán szellemes, hanem a dekonstrukció költői formája. Frady e verssel nemcsak József Attila hangját parodizálja, hanem a magyar kultúrpolitikai sérelmek évszázados ismétlődését is megmutatja, méghozzá úgy, hogy közben a rímek bolondgombát esznek, a költői kép pedig vicclappá gyűrődik. Összességében: ez nem levél, hanem verbális exhumálás. És Frady lapáttal jött.” /ChatGPT, a mesterséges intelligencia/ „Frady Endre költeménye nem egyszerűen paródia: egy groteszk válaszlevél József Attila klasszikus ""Születésnapomra"" című művére. A vers szatirikus hangvétele, bravúrosan odaillő rímpárosai és nyelvi játékossága egyfajta irodalmi stand-upként hat, ahol a líra humortól pukkan szét. A vers rövid strófákban építkezik, általában négy sorban, amelyek a rímpárosok révén csattanós hatást keltenek („Agya / ragya”, „Iááá-t / kiá't”). A formai törések („dékán / dékán”) ironikus önreflexióként is értelmezhetők, az önirónia és a költői szerepjáték parádés eszközei. A vers erősen groteszk, enyhén abszurd, mégis célzott: fricska a hatalmi pozícióban ülőkkel szemben. A humor néhol harsány, néhol fájdalmasan cinikus. Az „Iááá-t / kiá't” páros egyenesen burleszkbe hajlik. A költő az irodalomtörténet egyik legismertebb konfliktusát dolgozza fel – a József Attila és Horger Antal közti szellemi összecsapást –, de nem tiszteleg, hanem felforgat. A lírai én nem emlékezik megbánással, inkább karikíroz, és végül egyfajta szimbolikus megbocsátással zár („betem- / -etem”). Ez a vers egy irodalmi tabló, ahol Frady Endre bohócsipkában táncol az irodalmi kánon szigorú tanári asztalán. Bátran nyúl a magyar költészet egyik klasszikusához, hogy újra értelmezze – nem piedesztálra emeli, hanem megtáncoltatja. Egyben emlékeztet rá: a líra nemcsak emelhet, de nevettethet is.” /Copilot, a mesterséges intelligencia/ „Mit reagált Horger Antal az eredeti versre? Ez biztos jobban tetszene neki, mint az.” /M. András, a költő legállandóbb és legkíváncsibb kommentelője/ „A leghatározottabban tiltakozom! Ez a vers még szörnyűbb, mint az a bizonyos vérlázító förtelem volt anno! Hogyhogy mit reagáltam?! Ezt: Eltanácsoltam s e fattyú, Elszállt innen, mint egy hattyú. Aztán megírta a sztorit E nyominger imposztor itt, S míg vonat ment át tetemén, Harmadszor is nősültem én. Amúgy hagyjanak engem békében meghalva lenni! A bajszos nyominger meg forogjon csak a sírjában!” /Horger Antal (1872-1946), nyelvész professzor/ „Hát igen, valahogy így... Amúgy Horger Antal nyelvésznek jobb volt, mint embernek. Az a bizonyos vers nekem sem tetszik (a „Születésnapomra” igen), de nem tanácsoltam volna el senkit egy vers miatt.” /M...."

mov_AAA2B9D0740C08489792910BD04E586C,2025-07-08 14:40:30,en,WEB,"  The invitation for Chanel's haute couture show this season came with a hefty add-on: an advance edition of “Chanel Haute Couture,” a gold-covered coffee table book edited by Sofia Coppola to commemorate the 110th anniversary of the house's bespoke division. To emphasize its heritage, the brand transformed an upper gallery of the Grand Palais, which recently completed the second stage of its spectacular renovation, into a replica of its historic haute couture salon on Rue Cambon, complete with beige banquettes and mirrored panels inspired by its famed Art Deco staircase. Floor-to-ceiling curtains and a deep pile carpet evoked the hushed ambiance of private fittings at Chanel HQ. The collection, by contrast, propelled the audience into the great outdoors, with chunky outerwear, thigh-high boots and a palette of forest hues. Ahead of creative director Matthieu Blazy's official debut in October, it was once again designed by a studio team, though you could sense a shift was afoot. It's been a while since the brand had this much fun with texture, from the hulking feathered shoulders on a nubby ivory tweed cape, to the ragged fringe edging tweed tunics or a fluffy black big bird coat — a mix of tweed, feathers and chiffon — tossed over a slinky ivory evening gown. The lineup was inspired by founder Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel's love of Scotland, where she discovered her signature fabric, tweed. It was worked into suits with long fishtail skirts, split jackets with military-style pockets, and a long buttoned vest and double-layered pants in burnished gold, echoing the gilded wheat sheafs left on each seat. Looks were rife with trompe-l'oeil effects, from the raindrop sequins on a glossy black greatcoat worn with a tiered skirt in lacquered lace, to the frothy white collar on a black bouclé wool column coat, flecked with wool and silk tufts the color of fresh snow. Some of the oversize volumes erred on the side of bulky, as in cardigan skirt suits with dense lattice-woven embroideries or passementerie fringe. But a pantsuit in olive camouflage brushed wool hinted at a more untamed side to the Chanel woman — the jacket's hairy outline contrasting with its sparkling black buttons and trim. More in Style “These are the premises of Matthieu's influence,” said Bruno Pavlovsky, president of fashion and president of Chanel SAS. “The team has done an amazing job and Matthieu is starting to give his input, and it's great to have this gradual handover. It's not a break, it's something that will allow us to continue feeding the brand.” The designer, who officially started on April 1, joined the house at a challenging time for the luxury sector. Though Chanel reported that revenues fell 4.3 percent last year at comparable rates, Pavlovsky said he was encouraged by its performance so far this year. “Chanel is doing very well in the current context. At any rate, we are above our forecasts,” he said. “This slowdown is forcing us to focus on fundamentals, and when those fundamentals are well executed, the response is also positive in stores, so I remain quite optimistic.” Word is that Blazy quietly slipped into the show to support his new teammates. Come next season, all eyes will be on the man behind the curtain. Launch Gallery: Chanel Fall 2025 Couture"

Pour cette saison, le défilé s'est tenu dans le mythique Salon d'Honneur du Grand Palais, un écrin qui a vu défiler les silhouettes les plus travaillées et somptueuses de la maison. L'événement a rassemblé la crème des ambassadrices Chanel.

Designed by the Chanel Creation Studio and set against a decor crafted by Willo Perron, the show evoked the intimate ambiance of Gabrielle Chanel's legendary Haute Couture salons at 31, rue Cambon, where Mademoiselle herself pioneered a return to understated sophistication. Photo Credit: Courtesy of Chanel This collection is a breath of fresh air, drawing inspiration from the vast English countryside and rugged Scottish moors that once captivated Gabrielle Chanel. It reimagines winter classics through a pastoral lens, presenting suits in earthy tones of ecru, ivory, brown, green, and black. Borrowing proportions from menswear, these pieces prioritize freedom of movement, embodying Chanel's revolutionary vision of liberating women's bodies. The collection's fabrics tell a story of harmony between nature and craftsmanship. Tweed, a Chanel hallmark, is reinterpreted with innovative textures: a knitted allure transforms it into a white coatdress adorned with embroidered braids, a suit jacket resembling a cozy jumper, and mohair suits in rich autumnal shades of green and plum. Bouclé tweed mimics the soft warmth of sheepskin in a black-and-white coatdress, a skirt suit, a long gilet, and ivory short trousers, hand-painted and embroidered for added artistry. Feathers elevate tweed to faux-fur elegance in a trouser suit, a long coat, an embroidered over-cape, and a short blouson jacket, blending rustic charm with couture finesse. Photo Credit: Courtesy of Chanel Wheat ears, a cherished symbol of abundance for Gabrielle Chanel, weave their way through the collection as a poetic motif. They appear as delicate feathers in the chiffon flounces of a black-and-white strappy dress, embroidered along the neckline of the wedding dress, and as chevron-inspired patterns on a pants ensemble. Jewel-buttons, many bearing the wheat ear emblem, add a touch of opulence. Multicolored floral embroidery blooms across an embroidered pea coat and a satin crêpe pinafore dress, completing the pastoral narrative. As the collection turns to sunlight, it captures its radiant glow with golden jewel-buttons, intricate embroidery, and ennobled gold and silver lace. A flounced dress in shimmering orange lamé radiates warmth, embodying the collection's luminous finale. Each piece reflects Chanel's commitment to modernity, honoring the woman who reshaped fashion by prioritizing comfort and movement. Photo Credit: Courtesy of Chanel The Chanel Fall-Winter 2025/26 Haute Couture collection invites us to reconnect with nature and embrace freedom. By channeling Gabrielle Chanel's trailblazing spirit, this collection redefines luxury as effortless, refined, and deeply rooted in the beauty of the natural world. For those seeking greener pastures, Chanel offers a vision of couture that is both timeless and forward-looking, a fitting tribute to Mademoiselle's enduring legacy.

The Oscar-winning actress donned a Chanel jacket, featuring a tailored silhouette with allover shimmering details intricately woven into the fabric. Cruz's outfit also included a black jacket with off-white trim and pearl detailing, along with sinuous cuffs and subtle pinstripe lines of sparkling details. The actress carried a Chanel quilted bag and wore a pair of black heels to complete her ensemble. The actress' shimmering black suit, part of Chanel's cruise 2026 collection, made its runway debut last April. The Villa d'Este hotel in Italy served as the backdrop for the collection's showcase, featuring designs that paid homage to the Romy Schneider wearing Gabrielle Chanel designs in his 1962 movie “Boccaccio 70,” per Luisa Zargani's WWD review of the collection. Highlights from the collection included “tweed miniskirts in a beautiful wisteria hue that matched the blooms on the terrace, for example, and short taffeta dresses in a peach or pink color with flounces and ruffles — although at times the frilly effect could have been toned down a bit,” Zargani added. The collection marked a turning point for the French luxury fashion house. Matthieu Blazy, who spent much of his formative years at Bottega Veneta, was named Chanel's creative director in December 2024. The designer's first collection for the label will be featured in October. As of last April, the designer is reportedly assembling his team. Ahead of the fall 2025 couture show, guests from Sofia Coppola to Cruz, Keira Knightley and more kicked off Paris Couture Week with the Bal d'Été at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs on Sunday in Paris.

mov_D4DBAC5F1C3626FFC0DD8734D0822801,2025-07-08 15:28:44,en,WEB,"  Paris Couture Week 2025 saw an unforgettable moment when Lisa Haydon took over the runway as Rahul Mishra's muse, leaving the audience awe-inspired. Held on July 7 inside the stunning refectory of Collège des Bernardins, Rahul Mishra's show offered a poetic narrative through fashion—and Lisa embodied that story in its purest form. Dressed in an ethereal white ensemble, she became the living symbol of Mishra's Fall Couture 2024 collection, aptly titled Becoming Love. Lisa Haydon, known for her timeless elegance and striking presence, was nothing short of celestial in a sheer sequin corset gown designed with Rahul Mishra's signature love for intricate Indian craftsmanship. The dress glistened under the Parisian lights, drawing attention to the delicate floral motifs and the fluid artistry behind its creation. A floor-length silhouette, cinched bodice, and refined layers of sheer detail rendered Lisa a goddess-like figure on the catwalk. The collection Becoming Love is Mishra's introspective ode to the transformative journey of love—evolving through seven deeply emotional stages: attraction, infatuation, surrender, reverence, devotion, obsession, and finally, death. Lisa Haydon did more than model the garment; she became the narrative's visual heartbeat. Her graceful movements and regal presence reflected each stage of Mishra's love story, making the runway moment a meditative performance rather than a mere fashion showcase. Read more: Sangeeta Bijlani: From Miss India to Bollywood Stardom and Beyond Adding to her divine appearance was the elegant jewellery from Tanishq Diamonds's 'Radiance in Rhythm' collection. A bold necklace paired with matching earrings accentuated Lisa's sculpted features, adding sparkle without overshadowing the artistic brilliance of her gown. Her slicked-back hairstyle and understated makeup further amplified the ensemble's romantic and artistic core, allowing the outfit's message of emotional depth and natural beauty to shine through. Lisa's walk wasn't just about haute couture; it was a tribute to Indian artistry, a salute to nature's elegance, and a bold proclamation of love in all its stages. From the choice of fabric to the layered detailing, every element paid homage to Indian craftsmanship, reimagined for a global couture audience. The shimmery florals on her dress were not just embellishments—they were metaphors for growth, renewal, and transformation. As one of the most talked-about appearances of the evening, Lisa Haydon's runway moment resonated far beyond fashion circles. Her performance at Paris Haute Couture Week 2025 marked a proud moment for Indian fashion on the international stage. With American rapper Cardi B making a fashionable late entry, the star-studded event gained even more traction and buzz. Rahul Mishra's show was a testament to the power of storytelling through design. The setting, Collège des Bernardins, with its historical reverence, served as the perfect backdrop to narrate Mishra's concept of becoming love—a journey as spiritual as it is emotional. Lisa Haydon's radiant portrayal of this vision stood out, not just because of her appearance, but for the emotion she channeled with every step.

The ongoing Paris Haute Couture Week, which runs till July 10, is already making headlines with shows by leading fashion houses like Chanel, Giorgio Armani Privé, Elie Saab, Zuhair Murad, and Balenciaga. Yet, it is moments like Lisa Haydon walking for Rahul Mishra that redefine fashion—not merely as an industry but as a form of expressive, emotional, and cultural art. In the end, Lisa Haydon did not just walk the runway—she celebrated it. In a setting soaked in history, wearing a creation steeped in tradition and storytelling, she reminded the world that couture can be deeply human. Her presence in Paris was not only a fashion highlight but a celebration of Indian pride and poetic elegance on the world stage."

mov_268EC231BC5CD305570919AC4CCFFD9D,2025-07-08 15:40:43,en,WEB,"  ARTIST'S HOME: The late poet and artist Jean Cocteau could add Loro Piana to his list of fashionable affiliations, which already include Coco Chanel and Elsa Schiaparelli, among others. The Italian luxury house's fall 2025 ad campaign was photographed by Mario Sorrenti inside Villa Santo Sospir, the French intellectual's residence in the south of France surrounded by lush greenery. In keeping with its recent habit of choosing artists' private homes as the backdrop for its campaigns, Loro Piana traveled from Casa das Canoas, the Oscar Niemeyer-designed residence in Brazil that served as the set for the spring campaign, to Saint-Jean-Cap-Ferrat on the French Riviera. Models Alix Bouthors, Leon Dame, Long Li, Awar Odhiang and Binx Walton are captured enjoying a fictional weekend at the secluded villa, bathed in warm light and filled with artworks, including the murals drawn free hand by the late Cocteau on the walls between windows, above the fireplace and along the circular columns dotting the residence. “The mesmerizing Villa Santo Sospir, with its unique artistic legacy, was the ideal place to shoot Loro Piana's fall 2025 campaign. The tattooed walls of the house perfectly enhanced a collection filled with painterly references of landscapes around the world,” Sorrenti said. “What emerged is an elegant lively ease, an organic flow of shapes, colors and textures, exuding a profound yet effortless sophistication.” The fall collection, unveiled during Milan Fashion Week last February, spotlighted the relationship between Loro Piana and nature, which it celebrated by focusing on lands close to its history and precious fibers. The collection's journey touched down in Argentina, the Scottish Highlands, as well as New Zealand and Australia, home of its merino wool, for a refined traveler's wardrobe crafted from top-notch fabrications exuding nonchalant sophistication. The tactile and textured quality of the garments and embroidery is enhanced by the patterned walls and sophisticated decor of the villa in the ad campaign images bowing on Thursday."

Pour la saison automne-hiver 2025-2026, la maison française revisite les classiques de l'hiver et réinterprète une nouvelle fois l'emblématique tweed qui prend des allures de tricot dans des robes plus ou moins longues, des manteaux longs et des tailleurs jupes et pantalons aux silhouettes taille basse, habillés de sequins, plumes et autres perles. ""Leurs proportions empruntées au vestiaire masculin assurent au corps une pleine liberté de mouvement"", note un communiqué de la maison. Des robes et jupes plus légères, de soie ou de voile et le plus souvent volantées, s'invitent également dans ce nouveau dressing qui joue avec les superpositions, avec des jupes longues ouvertes sur des plus courtes ou encore de larges ceintures à poches. Le tout se déclinant en noir, beige et blanc, et assorti avec des cuissardes à bouts ronds. PUBLICITÉ Le défilé s'est achevé par la traditionnelle mariée, avec une robe blanche à manches longues à sequins, qui s'évase à mi-cuisse sur un jupon en tulle. Ce nouveau vestiaire était présenté non pas sous la nef du Grand Palais comme c'est le cas habituellement, cette dernière accueillant l'installation monumentale du Brésilien Ernesto Neto, mais dans le Salon d'Honneur décoré avec de larges tentures drapées et de confortables canapés beiges, à la manière des salons haute couture du 31 rue Cambon, siège parisien historique de la maison. - Pop stars - Parmi les invités, figuraient les actrices Marion Cotillard, Virginie Ledoyen, Penelope Cruz, Kirsten Dunst ainsi que les reines de la pop Lorde et Gracie Abrams. La prochaine collection, présentée en octobre lors de la Fashion Week féminine de Paris, sera signée Matthieu Blazy, nommé en décembre, six mois après le brusque départ de Virginie Viard. PUBLICITÉ Le Franco-Belge de 41 ans, débauché de chez Bottega Veneta (groupe Kering) dont il était le directeur artistique depuis 2021, aura la lourde charge d'incarner la ligne Chanel. Et de tourner la page Karl Lagerfeld, le ""Kaiser"" ayant régné pendant plus de trois décennies. Son bras droit Virginie Viard lui avait succédé à son décès en 2019, avant de quitter la maison après des mois de crise. Chez Bottega Veneta, le créateur avait séduit dès sa première collection en février 2022 par son approche moderne de ""l'intreccio"", technique de tissage à la main propre à la marque. Sa nomination, avec celle de Jonathan Anderson chez Dior, est le plus gros événement du vaste mercato qui agite la mode depuis plus d'un an, en réaction aux turbulences économiques que traverse le luxe. Avec leur première collection femme, Jonathan Anderson ayant déjà présenté un vestiaire homme très applaudi en juin, les deux créateurs seront sans nul doute les attractions de la rentrée mode. - Stéphane Rolland rejoue le Boléro - PUBLICITÉ Le couturier Stéphane Rolland a, de son côté, investi le Théâtre des Champs-Élysées pour présenter sa nouvelle collection au son du ""Boléro"" de Maurice Ravel, interprété en direct par l'orchestre symphonique Divertimento, devant des stars telles que la rappeuse américaine Cardi B et l'actrice française Carole Bouquet. ""J'avais toujours rêvé de faire un défilé sur le +Boléro+"", a confié le styliste français à l'AFP, en expliquant avoir imaginé cette collection à partir du ballet du compositeur. ""Ce que j'ai aimé faire, c'est de pousser le lyrique dans la création de mes vêtements"", poursuit-il. Stéphane Rolland a ainsi une nouvelle fois livré des tenues de soirée à la silhouette fatale et très structurées avec des décolletés souvent vertigineux, aux inspirations espagnoles mais aussi japonaises, dans ses couleurs fétiches que sont le rouge, le noir et le blanc. mdv/mch/jco"

1lut2fp,2025-07-08 16:26:22,en,REDDIT,"  The other day, while I was having drinks with friends, a wasp came flying right up to my face. Not just any wasp… This one looked bitter, disappointed with life and full of hatred. The dangerous kind, nothing left to lose. I managed to stay calm for about three microseconds before going into full panic mode. Some douchebag at the next table yelled, “Don't move, if you stay still, he'll go away.” Why is it always the ugliest guys giving the dumbest wasp advice? Like pretending to be chill with wasps will finally get them laid. If he would analyze himself a bit and look in the mirror he would reslise that if he keeps being more invested in not loosing  sunday'd dungeouns & dragons games, he will definitely necer loose his virginity. I doubt he has actuslly ever really seen himself in any mirror, as his reflection only shows up when a 10-year-old in pajamas whispers “Candyman” three times. And the only ever 2 or 3 times in life, anyone was brave enough to try it out, he probably ended up crying out of fear and, the girls would be thinking “Ugh, what kind of demon is this? whilstcthey push him back into the mirror abysm before he can even set one foot into the gorls slumber party. They realise they just risked their lifes and instead of getting an actual, cool, professional looking demon, they have summonned a mediocre, nerd looking being who cant stop crying and has 0 magical powers. . This same type always says, “He's more scared of you than you are of him.” Thanks Jeremy, have heard that before, Just shut up. Your opinion isnt valid. Wasps feel pity for guys like you, not fear. That's WHY YOU NEVER HAVE TO WORRY OF THEM APPROACHING YOU. so yeah, now go home and think about it. Anyway, I turned and responded to him “No the fuck he won't leave, shut up!” I could tell this wasp had evil plans, circling my eye sockets like he wanted to sting me right in the eyeball and fly off with it. Do you know what they do with all those eyeballs? ( Apart from showing them off to their ghetto wasp bros? ) First they play rock-paper-scissors to see who gets the crunchy part of the cornea, literally the only part they eat. The rest? They don't recycle it. No. They have entire eyeball trophy walls in their nests, each with a little name tag, date, location, even the weight. They pose with the eyeballs like influencers showing off a new Chanel bag, post it on Waspagram, hashtags and all. But they don't fool me. I know they're hanging out in parks, smoking real pot, not as in bees honey pots…those are bee hp ey pots. And bees are alright, a bit arrogant sonetimes, but totallymanageable. Now Wasps? They enslave cockroaches to carry them around like tiny horses because apparently flying is just too mainstream. Like imagine I walked around with a sharp medieval sword sticking out of my ass 24/7, twerking aggressively into people. Would anyone invite me to a birthday party? No, they'd call the police. There was no way I was letting this bastard ruin my Halloween. I'd already bought my slutty police officer costume and wasn't about to switch it for a sad-ass Jack Sparrow. So I snapped. “I'm gonna get you, Billy Charles Junior!” I yelled. That wasp looked triggered. Only his mom used his full name when she was pissed. I cornered him. He fought back, I'll give him that, but in the end, he took his last buzz. I tried scratching some pieces of Billy off the newspaper, and then looked him in the eyes and whispered, “Not so immortal now, huh MF?” I could have been talking to his butt gun, I couldnt really guarantee  after a newspaper hit. Judging by the splatter, I probably struck him at 120 waspo-meters an hour. Just enough to cause an instant, painless death, luckilty..."
mov_D860B45CC881164B5802066C3B6DC299,2025-07-08 16:32:00,en,WEB,"  Chelsea Odufu is a director and multidisciplinary artist known for crafting bold, culturally-resonant commercial and experiential work. She has directed campaigns for brands such as Dr. Martens, Target, Chase Sapphire, Chanel, Bose, and Walgreens, bringing a cinematic eye and deep storytelling sensibility to every project. Rooted in her background as a visual artist working across film, sculpture, and installation, Chelsea approaches branded work with a distinctive aesthetic and emotional depth. Her fine art practice, which has been exhibited at institutions including the Los Angeles Contemporary Art Museum, The Shed, Dakar Biennale, Christie's London, Seattle Art Museum, and the Harvey Gantt Center, fuels her ability to build immersive worlds that are both conceptually rich and visually striking. Whether creating a film, commercial, or a full-scale brand experience, her work always centres story, soul, and style. Name: Chelsea Odufu Location: USA Repped by/in: Chromista LBB> What elements of a script set one apart from another, and what sort of scripts get you excited to shoot them? Chelsea> For me, it's always about the feeling underneath the script. A great one speaks through the page – it pulses with rhythm, imagery, and soul. If it has a clear sense of world, tone, and emotional stakes, I'm in. Scripts that feel alive and allow for layered visual interpretation or world-building are what excite me most. I'm drawn to scripts that carry a heartbeat – ones that don't just tell a story, but vibrate with cultural, emotional, or spiritual texture. LBB> How do you approach creating a treatment for a spot? Chelsea> I treat it like an invitation into a new reality. I start with tone – how should this feel in the body? From there, I build a visual language, often weaving in references from fashion, music videos, cultural images, architecture, or nature. I anchor everything in intention, then structure the treatment almost like a visual essay. It's less about selling and more about conjuring: helping people feel the frequency of the story before it's even shot. LBB> If the script is for a brand you're unfamiliar with or a market you're new to, how important is it for you to do research and understand that strategic and contextual side of the ad? How do you do it? Chelsea> It's crucial. I can't authentically express something unless I understand the world it lives in. I'll research the brand's visual history, voice, mission, and market presence, but I also dig deeper. Who are they really talking to? What's not being said? I want to understand both the culture and the counterculture. I spend time watching their audience, listening to the tone of the streets, and tuning into what resonates emotionally in that space. LBB> For you, what is the most important working relationship for a director to have with another person in making an ad? And why? Chelsea> The creative director or lead agency voice is key. That relationship sets the tone for everything else. It's where trust, flow, and respect for the core idea live. When that relationship is strong, it creates space for experimentation, clarity, and alignment so the idea can evolve in the best way possible. But I also really value my relationship with the DoP because, together, we translate spirit into image. LBB> What type of work are you most passionate about? Is there a particular genre, subject matter, or style you're most drawn to? Chelsea> I'm most drawn to work that merges the metaphysical with the sensory: futurism, mysticism, identity, memory. I love when visual storytelling allows you to slip between dimensions, whether it's through surrealism, rhythmic editing, or symbolic world-building. I'm excited by cultural specificity, movement, intimacy, and anything that centres the experience of those who often live in the margins. LBB> What misconception about you or your work do you most often encounter—and why is it wrong? Chelsea> People sometimes assume my work is too artistic or too experimental to sell a product. That's a misconception. I believe deep feeling, cultural richness, and visual poetry are what move audiences. I've proven you can make work that's emotive, visually distinct, and aligned with the brand without compromising vision. We don't have to dilute the magic for it to be effective. LBB> Have you ever worked with a cost consultant and if so, how have your experiences been? Chelsea> Yes, and when approached collaboratively, they can be invaluable. I welcome anyone who helps us stay grounded in reality, especially when building ambitious or nontraditional concepts...."

""Anyway, the door of this private room opens and my friend Tim's head comes around [with another friend] and the third head to come around was James,"" she said. ""And James grabbed a seat and said, 'Hello, I'm your future husband,' and there he is. And we basically ate and drank until we got married. Well, drank until I got pregnant.” The Atonement actress also noted that she and Righton also had timing going for them. She said on the joint podcast that she thinks she and Righton would never have begun dating if she had not acted in a play based in London. ""It was great because it was a bunch of girls, we were all in our early [to] mid-twenties,"" Knightley said. ""We were all single and we were having a really, really, really, really good time and so I met [James] in the middle of that when he was also having a really, really, really, really good time.""

Romy, 18, selected a baby blue minidress teamed with black ankle-strap heels, silver jewelry and a quilted clutch, while Cosima, 15, went for a baby pink co-ord and block heels. The teens also showed off their personalized glam. While Romy opted for a dramatic eyeliner look and a romantic half-up hairstyle with curled ends, Cosima decided to match her outfit with blush pink makeup.

mov_BC6DE2CD6F6F4EE575F1AB14AF09F6DC,2025-07-08 17:31:46,en,WEB,"  PARIS (AP) — Only Chanel would call its legendary Rue Cambon salon “too small” — then rebuild it, supersized, in a palace. On Tuesday, as the house marked 110 years of its haute couture — a century and more of Coco Chanel's revolution in how women dress — it blew up its atelier as a giant set inside the freshly restored Grand Palais, turning intimacy into spectacle for a nature-drenched show at Paris Couture Week. Chanel, whose founder banished corsets and reimagined luxury as liberation, showed just how far that legacy stretches — from the tiny salons of 1915 to its modern colossus. It was a flex only a handful of luxury giants could pull off — and perhaps, as one front-row guest suggested, a dazzling distraction as the fashion world counts down to the debut of Chanel's new designer Matthieu Blazy. Penélope Cruz, Keira Knightley, Naomi Campbell, Kirsten Dunst and the house's tightest VIP circle scaled gilded steps, sweating past marble and gold, to enter the reconstructed atelier. The set by Willo Perron was classic Chanel — intimate yet monumental, Old World yet futuristic. “It just felt special,” Campbell said, “like stepping into a memory and something completely new. There's warmth, intimacy, nostalgia. Chanel can recreate anything, and it works."" Chanel goes country More drama unfolded on the runway. This was couture as nature fantasy, filtered through the Chanel prism. Menswear tailoring added swing to sculpted jackets and coatdresses, while mohair suits in deep greens and plums channeled autumn's hush. Bouclé tweeds mimicked sheepskin; feathers and tweed created illusionary faux fur. Gold-sprayed wheat ears — the house symbol of abundance — were everywhere: stitched into flounces, embroidered on necklines, set on every guest's seat. The theme may have been country, but make no mistake: This was as close as Chanel gets to “roughing it.” Technique dazzled at every turn: jewel-buttons, embroidered florals and a finale of lamé so luminous it mimicked sunlight on harvest fields. The studio team, holding the fort after Virginie Viard's abrupt and unceremonious exit last year, anchored the show in classic codes but played with wit and lightness. That obsessive handwork matters — not just for tradition, but for business. Chanel is fashion's juggernaut: Privately held, the brand reported $18.7 billion in revenue for 2024, cementing its status as one of the world's most powerful luxury houses. Couture may be the crown, but its influence drives global sales in fragrance, bags and jewelry, making it the envy of rivals. New era for the luxury giant Change is always looming at Chanel. For more than 30 years, Karl Lagerfeld transformed the brand from Parisian legend to pop phenomenon, staging ever-grander spectacles at the Grand Palais. After his death in 2019, Viard, his longtime deputy, guided Chanel into a softer, more discreet era. Now the industry is holding its breath for Blazy, a Belgian talent with stints at Margiela, Celine and most recently Bottega Veneta, where he won fans for his blend of innovation and reverence for craft. Campbell said of Blazy, whom she knows personally: “He's focused, open-minded — he'll bring something special.” Tuesday's show unfolded inside the Grand Palais' newly restored Salon d'Honneur, its gold and stone revealed after a 600-million-euro, multiyear restoration co-funded by Chanel. It's more than a venue; it's an advertisement of the house's power and commitment to Parisian heritage. Thomas Adamson, The Associated Press"

Email tips@dailymail.com Sofia Coppola brought along her two teenage daughters to Tuesday's Chanel Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2025-2026 fashion show. Romy, 18, towered over the Priscilla director while Cosima, 15, also stood slightly taller than their 54-year-old mother. The filmmaker stands at 5'4"" without shoes, but the women all added height to their frames with classic round-toe Chanel heels. Sofia - who starred in The Godfather Part III -  was dressed in a heather gray top, subtly patterned sky blue jacket, and white trousers. She accessorized with a quilted white Chanel purse, and her shoulder-length bob was styled in a side part and loose waves. Her children were equally fashionable, with her firstborn child clad in a pale blue shift dress with a fringed hemline. She toted a tiny, matching pastel box purse while punctuating the ensemble with Mary Jane style shoes. Romy's younger sister opted for a pink mini dress with a matching cardigan, adding two-toned slingback footwear. Speaking to Vogue after the Chanel presentation, Romy called it 'the most beautiful show.' Sofia shares her brood with longtime husband Thomas Mars, who is the lead singer of the band Phoenix. Their older daughter made headlines in 2023 when she went viral for revealing that her parents grounded her for trying to charter a helicopter. At the time, she'd uploaded a clip to TikTok explaining that she was punished for attempting to use her dad's credit card to fly from New York to Maryland 'to have dinner with my camp friend.' Romy shared that she was killing her time at home by making a vodka pasta sauce. In the clip she also admitted that her parents' 'biggest rule' was that she was not allowed to have public social media. 'But TikTok's not going to make me famous, so it doesn't really matter,' she rationalized. Her mother Sofia, who is known for fiercely protecting her family's privacy, later told The Hollywood Reporter she was 'not thrilled' about the viral moment. 'She's funny,' she said. ' But people discussing my parenting publicly is not what I would've hoped for.' In May Romy showcased her music ambitions as she released a catchy soft-pop tune called A-lister. And the nepo baby enlisted none other than her mother to direct its accompanying music video. Despite her previous claim that she was not permitted to have public social media accounts, she now has a public Instagram page with 160,000 followers."

It's safe to say that Sofia Coppola just scored major cool mom points. This morning, the Oscar-winning director attended the Chanel Couture fall/winter 2025 presentation in Paris and was joined by her two teenage daughters: Romy, 18, and Cosima, 15. Marking a rare appearance, the mother-daughter trio sat front row as they watched the Chanel in-house team's final collection ahead of Matthieu Blazy's takeover. Coppola and her daughters, Romy and Cosima, were decked out in head-to-toe Chanel. Stephane Cardinale - Corbis - The matriarch and longtime Chanel ambassador wore a subdued outfit consisting of white jeans, a gray t-shirt and a collarless blue jacket, while her daughters—whom she shares with French musician Thomas Mars—opted for a more colorful palette for their Chanel couture front-row debut. Romy wore a sleeveless blue knit mini dress, while her younger sister wore a pink waffle knit mini dress with a coordinating cropped cardigan. All three accessorized with Chanel cap-toe shoes and bags. Romy, a rising musician on social media, shared a of her getting ready with her glam squad, who created her dramatic winged eye look and half updo. Also sitting front row with the Coppola-Mars' was Kirsten Dunst, Coppola's frequent collaborator. The actress kept her look simple, wearing an all-black outfit. The Coppola-Mars' were joined by Kirsten Dunst at the presentation. WWD - Today's outing comes just days Romy and Cosima also joined their mom at the Le Bal d'Été, a summer ball which Coppola art directed at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs to kick off Couture Week. The girls have been making more and more appearances as of late since reaching their teenage years. Earlier this year, Cosima attended Anna Sui and Marc Jacob shows during New York Fashion Week, while Romy joined her grandfather, Francis Ford Coppola, at Cannes last year for the premiere of Megalopolis. Coppola, who comes from Hollywood royalty herself, has famously valued privacy and raising her daughters outside of the Hollywood spotlight. She previously opened up about how being private “seems normal to me” and how she was “raised to be so private.” That, however, went out the door in 2023 when Romy went viral on TikTok after she was grounded for trying to charter a helicopter so she can have dinner with a camp friend. The outing marked a rare appearance for Coppola's daughters (here, Romy). WWD - Months later, Coppola commented on the incident, telling the Hollywood Reporter that “social media is so opposite of how I grew up” and “it was the best way for her to be rebellious."" ""I got a lot of compliments on her filmmaking. And comedy,” Coppola added. “She's funny. But people discussing my parenting publicly is not what I would've hoped for.”"

Inspired by the simplicity of nature and Chanel's 31 rue Cambon ateliers, the line was the last created by the label's in-house team before new creative director Matthieu Blazy's first runway debuts in October. Tweed skirt suits, separates, and dresses were crafted in smooth knits and soft mohair, cast in tonal shades of deep gold, cream, plum, black, and dark green. Added levity came from multicolored flowers, seen in embroidery on dresses and coats. Wheat ears—which Gabrielle Chanel saw as a symbol of abundance—were prominent throughout the collection, embroidered across dresses, embossed on sparkling buttons, and clutched in a golden bouquet held by the show's finale bride. A star-studded crowd was in attendance for the occasion as well, including Lorde, Gracie Abrams, Keira Knightley, Naomi Campbell, Laufey, Kirsten Dunst, Sofia Coppola, Romy Mars, Cosima Mars, Marion Cotillard, and more. All images: Courtesy of Chanel Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, and Neiman Marcus Face Dropping Summer Sales It's shaping up to be a challenging sales year for luxury brands—including Saks Fifth Avenue. The retailer, which merged earlier this year with Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman in a $2.7 billion deal, has faced a sales drop of 28% compared to 2024, according to The Business of Fashion. Alongside Saks, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf's sales also dropped 26% each compared to last year. The shift follows Saks Global's release of its financial performance in May, where the combined revenue of Saks, Neiman's, and Bergdorf's dropped 10% to $7.3 billion. The group's low sales also follow the luxury slowdown of 2024 that's continued into 2025, with decreasing sales affecting brands including Chanel, Hermès, Gucci, Burberry, and more.

The policy, which has existed at U.S. airports from the Transportation Security Administration since 2006, is being phased out this year, according to People. Some airports have already let passengers keep their shoes on while checking in, including Baltimore/Washington International Airport, Portland International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, Fort Lauderdale International Airport, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, and Piedmont Triad International Airport. As of Monday, the New York City's LaGuardia Airport and Los Angeles International Airport have also apparently begun implanting the new policy as well. However, if passengers' shoes trigger security scanners, they will still have to remove their shoes to be screened. (firstVIEW) Additional reporting by Julia Karns and Katie Bradshaw.

Biranje poklona za muškarca može delovati kao izazov, ali uz nekoliko proverenih smernica – lako je pogoditi. Bilo da kupuješ za partnera, brata, tatu, kolegu ili prijatelja, ključno je da poklon bude praktičan, kvalitetan i po mogućstvu – ličan. Evo nekoliko predloga koji sigurno ne razočaravaju: Čuveni lekar razbio POZNATI MIT O MLEKU, tvrdi da je to laž u koju verujemo ceo život 08.07.2025. 18:53 1. Parfem koji ostavlja utisak Klasičan, ali uvek cenjen poklon. Izaberi miris koji je muževan, dugotrajan i moderan. Neki od favorita su: Dior Sauvage, Bleu de Chanel, Paco Rabanne 1 Million. 2. Sat – stil i funkcija u jednom Sat je više od pokazivača vremena – on je odraz stila. Od elegantnih ručnih satova do pametnih modela (kao što su Garmin ili Apple Watch), uvek ostavlja jak utisak. 3. Set za negu Savremeni muškarac vodi računa o sebi. Poklon set sa balzamom za bradu, gelom za tuširanje, kremom za lice i parfemom je sjajan znak pažnje – i korisna stvar za svakodnevicu. 4. Tehno dodatak Za ljubitelje gadgeta – prenosivi zvučnik, bežične slušalice, power bank ili pametni kućni asistent (npr. Google Nest ili Amazon Echo) su pun pogodak. 5. Poklon sa ličnim pečatom Personalizovani pokloni ostavljaju najjači utisak. Gravirani privezak, narukvica, čaša sa imenom, foto-album ili čak mapa zvezdanog neba sa datuma kada ste se upoznali – pokazuju da si razmislila. Poklon u vidu iskustva, ne stvari Pokloni ne moraju biti opipljivi. Pokloni doživljaj – masažu za dvoje, vožnju kvadom, escape room, vikend putovanje ili večeru iznenađenja. Pokloni koji se pamte su često najbolji. Bez obzira na budžet, ključ je da poklon bude prilagođen njemu – i da pokaže da si mislila na detalje. Jer najbolji pokloni nisu najskuplji, već oni koji govore: „Znam šta voliš. “"

That's why it's no surprise to see her at their Fall/Winter 2025/2026 fashion show as part of Paris Fashion Week on Tuesday in Paris, France.

She made waves with a cameo on Sex and the City as Aleksandr Petrovsky's ex-wife, but has had endless roles in everything from In Therapy to Apple TV+'s recent French-language series, La Maison. But no matter the role, it's safe to say that Bouquet is still having plenty of fun. In a 2014 interview for the Cannes Film Festival, she reflected on how much pleasure she gets from tackling diverse roles. ""For me, cinema is like a keyhole through which we can find out what is happening in the world. I grew up and discovered life through film. Films also have to get people engaged and the films we are going to see are, in my opinion, very engaged. For me cinema remains an art,"" she explained.

n21puza,2025-07-08 20:05:21,en,REDDIT,"  I would argue against Wonder  Woman being a magical girl, because she is an Amazon, a superhero, a demi-goddess… Not a magical girl. Demi-goddess and goddess aren't magical girl, including in Japan, nor are Scarlet Witch, or Ms Marvel, and other mutants or Inhumans even with transformations. I think the « magical girl » we consider first in  Western world need to be among creations post the creation and cementing of 魔法少女. Magical girl genre came from Japan and our definition of it comes from it. Otherwise if if the definition simply stops at «  girl with powers, and possibly change costumes » we could literally go up to Antiquity myth, if not prehistory myth And Japan could technically also go back for millenias prior Anyway I think Magical Girl appeared as a genre in 60-70's ? I am really not sure but on the top of my head for western genre I would say Princess Gwenevere and the Jewel Riders. I remember them transforming and having their superpowers from the jewels they have…. Edit : I checked on the first magical girls and I think we can also basically ignore any witch who doesn't uses a wand or something to chanel a power and/or that transform (the latter isnnt necessary though). So basically the western witches like MCU Agatha or Sabrina or Halliwell sisters also don't fit ? I would say even if Harry Potter had been a shojo and Hermione the  MC character, the fact that they can do accidental magic, apparate or don't need to transform would also take it away."

mov_F68C8BE505A5D62F822783235736EB09,2025-07-08 21:03:10,en,WEB,"  The Chanel haute couture show began the day on a soft note — or pillows, rather. Held in an upper gallery of the Grand Palais, the setting featured plush velvet sofas and muted light, as an homage to Coco Chanel's salon. It was more apartment than runway, and the stars in attendance seemed to melt into its giant couches. “This room is, first of all, the most comfortable room I think I've ever seen a fashion show in,” said Kirsten Dunst, still shaking off jet lag and adjusting to Paris time. With two kids at home in L.A., she keeps a tight schedule and the actress said she hadn't found her equilibrium quite yet, having arrived before the Bal d'Été on Sunday. Dunst, who's marking the 25th anniversary of Sofia Coppola's “The Virgin Suicides,” reflected on the film's new life via TikTok. “For it to live on in the way that it has is so meaningful,” she said, as it grabs the attention of another generation. Her second collaboration with Coppola, “Marie Antoinette,” has also been rediscovered by Gen Z, often prompting teen girls to DM her with questions about the French queen, she said. “It's probably more accepted and relevant because of the times we're in,” she added. “Indie films, like when 'Virgin Suicides' came out, were more male dominated, and judged — like who were the reviewers?” she said, reflecting on the cultural shift. Dunst has two new projects back to back: “The Entertainment System Is Down,” the latest from two-time Palme d'Or winner Ruben Östlund, and “Roofman,” a heist dramedy costarring Channing Tatum. More in Entertainment The former is set on a plane filled with bored passengers, and filming predates TikTok's “raw dogging” travel trend, where users document themselves braving long flights without entertainment. “Ruben is always a few steps ahead,” Dunst said, noting the project's surreal tone and ensemble cast, including Keanu Reeves. “It was such a singular experience I don't think anything else will compare.” The film will be hoping for a Cannes berth. “You know Ruben, he wants that third Palme,” she joked. Coppola, seated with daughters Romy and Cosima Mars, who is currently interning at Chanel, presented “The Virgin Suicides” at the Louvre last week and the Biarritz film festival over the weekend. “I'm glad it holds up,” she said of the film's enduring legacy. She recently directed a video for budding musician Romy — though she said she was only following Romy's cues — and revealed she and Dunst are eyeing another film collaboration, with details still under wraps. Coppola likened TikTok to the DIY spirit of '90s indie 'zines. “It's something I don't understand, but it's fun to see how creative they are,” she said. “If it had been around, I probably would've filmed for it.” Keira Knightley also noted an anniversary. Her Jane Austen adaptation “Pride & Prejudice” celebrated its 20th anniversary earlier this year, which set off a slew of essays and think pieces about its enduring cultural significance. But the actress hasn't watched it in as many years. “If my kids are ever interested in watching it, maybe I will,” she said. “So far, they're just absolutely anti watching me in anything.” She recently wrapped “The Woman in Cabin 10,” a psychological thriller shot aboard a luxury superyacht. It was an experience she found somewhat less than luxe. “It was a little snug,” Knightley said, of 100-plus cast and crew on board. “I think it put me off the yachting experience for a while.” Penélope Cruz, another Chanel ambassador and longtime devotee of the brand, visited the atelier the day before. “Some gowns take over 800 hours to make,” she said. The Oscar-winner recalled sewing with her grandmother as a child — a ritual that took ages but “felt almost meditative” and created a bond across generations. “It's really beautiful that a brand like Chanel keeps fighting to maintain that,” she said. “Everything nowadays is instant gratification. If we don't preserve the things that require time and rhythm, we lose something.” Cruz is also starring in two upcoming films: first, “The Bride,” directed by Maggie Gyllenhaal, and “The Invite,” by Olivia Wilde. The former offers a new twist on the traditional Frankenstein tale. “She's done something so new and wild and rock 'n' roll,” Cruz said. She plays a detective with mixed feelings about the monster she's hunting. She's also directing her first documentary, a project two years in the making. “It's a very important story to me,” she said, though keeping mum for now. “I didn't want misunderstandings about what it is.” She's buckling down in the editing studio this fall, aiming for a cut by spring. Naomi Campbell was coiffed in a New Romantics-style '80s pouf. “I love '80s pop. It's my time, my era,” she said, though she's currently vibing to Burna Boy and Wizkid...."

1lv3x7i,2025-07-08 23:38:01,en,REDDIT,"  Perfume, derived from the Latin phrase *per fumum* meaning “through smoke,” has been an integral part of human civilization for millennia. Used in rituals, medicine, personal grooming, and status display, perfume is a sensory art form that has evolved with human culture. From its sacred origins in ancient Egypt to its widespread availability in today's global market, the story of perfume is as rich and layered as the fragrances themselves. # Ancient Beginnings: Egypt and the Cradle of Fragrance The earliest known use of perfume dates back to ancient Egypt, around 3000 BCE. Fragrance held a profound spiritual significance for the Egyptians. Perfumes were used in religious ceremonies, embalming processes, and as offerings to the gods. Fragrant oils and incense were considered a bridge between the earthly and the divine. Temples were often filled with scented smoke from burning myrrh, frankincense, and kyphi, a complex blend of resins, herbs, and honey. Wealthy Egyptians applied perfumed oils to their bodies not only for personal enjoyment but to mask body odor and protect their skin from the harsh desert climate. Perfume also signified social and spiritual status. Pharaohs were often buried with jars of precious scented oils and incense to accompany them into the afterlife. Archaeological evidence, such as the discovery of perfume vessels in tombs and artistic depictions on temple walls, attests to the deep-rooted significance of fragrance in Egyptian life. # The Influence of Mesopotamia, India, and China Simultaneously, other ancient civilizations developed their own perfumery traditions. In Mesopotamia, cuneiform tablets from around 1200 BCE describe the distillation of aromatic substances. Tapputi, a Mesopotamian woman mentioned on a cuneiform tablet, is often considered the world's first recorded chemist and perfumer. In ancient India, perfumery was closely tied to Ayurvedic medicine. The *Charaka Samhita* and other ancient texts describe aromatic oils and their therapeutic uses. Sandalwood, vetiver, and jasmine were commonly used in spiritual rituals and personal adornment. In China, fragrances were incorporated into traditional medicine, religious ceremonies, and daily life by the Han dynasty. Perfumed sachets were used not just for scent but also to ward off disease, aligning with Taoist and Confucian practices. # The Greek and Roman World: Perfume as Luxury and Science The Greeks adopted and refined Egyptian perfumery techniques, adding their own innovations. Theophrastus, a student of Aristotle, wrote one of the earliest known treatises on scent in his work *On Odors*. Greek perfumers began experimenting with infusions of aromatic materials in oils, laying the groundwork for modern techniques. The Romans expanded the reach and popularity of perfume across the empire. Fragrances became a daily indulgence among the elite, who used them in baths, cosmetics, and even to scent walls and fountains. Pliny the Elder lamented the excesses of Roman society's obsession with perfume, noting the massive importation of ingredients from across the empire. Roman innovations in glassmaking also helped in the development of more advanced storage vessels for perfume, making it easier to transport and preserve delicate fragrances. # The Islamic Golden Age: Science Meets Scent With the fall of the Roman Empire and the rise of the Islamic caliphates, perfume culture shifted eastward. Between the 8th and 13th centuries, Islamic scholars made monumental contributions to perfumery. Avicenna (Ibn Sina), a Persian polymath, is credited with perfecting the process of distillation—particularly steam distillation—which allowed for the extraction of essential oils from flowers like roses. Fragrance was deeply embedded in Islamic culture, inspired by religious teachings that emphasized cleanliness and the use of pleasant scents. Perfumes were used in mosques, homes, and daily life. Markets in cities like Baghdad, Cairo, and Cordoba offered an array of fragrant materials: musk, ambergris, oud, rose, and spices from across the known world. This period also saw the writing of sophisticated treatises on the preparation and blending of perfumes, making fragrance both an art and a science. # The Renaissance and the Birth of Modern Perfumery in Europe Perfume re-entered Western Europe through trade with the Middle East and North Africa, becoming a symbol of wealth and refinement among the European aristocracy. The 14th century saw the development of “Hungary Water,” one of the first alcohol-based perfumes, made for Queen Elizabeth of Hungary. This innovation marked a shift from oil-based to alcohol-based perfumes, which were lighter and evaporated more quickly. By the 16th century, France had become a center of perfume production. Italian perfumers, invited by Catherine de' Medici, brought their skills to the French court. Grasse, a town in southern France, soon emerged as the epicenter of the European fragrance industry due to its ideal climate for growing flowers like lavender, rose, and jasmine. Perfume use flourished in the French court under Louis XIV, who was famously known as the ""Perfume King."" Scented gloves, handkerchiefs, and wigs became fashionable among nobles, and entire rooms were perfumed to mask the unpleasant odors of urban life. # Industrialization and Global Expansion The 19th century ushered in industrialization, revolutionizing perfumery through synthetic chemistry. Scientists isolated aromatic compounds such as vanillin and coumarin, enabling perfumers to create consistent, affordable fragrances...."

mov_36214DE3F6D9C761706D24D8389CD787,2025-07-09 01:24:28,en,WEB,"  Third Time's the Charm is not only the name of a new restaurant opening in Red Hook: It is also the story of Chris Milazzo, a so-called “recovering lawyer,” who launched the pizza pop-up Bad Cholesterol a couple of years ago, and became a fixture at Talea taproom. He's now on his third act, opening an actual restaurant, targeting a September opening. “We're thinking of Charm as a supper club for the rest of us,” Milazzo said in a press release. “No membership fees. No celebs. Just a place to tuck in, put your elbows up, and befriend the bartenders.” Sourdough pizza will, of course, continue to play a role, but the menu will also veer into other childhood favorites, like a riff on the Bloomin' Onion and chicken nuggets. Third Time's the Charm is joined by partner Sean Klim (who was in the kitchen at Bad Cholesterol and chef Sam Savage (who also worked on the pop-up). It replaces what was operator Erin Norris' longtime restaurant Grindhaus, there since 2013, and which had more recently rebranded to OurHaus, at 275 Van Brunt Street, near Visitation Place, in Brooklyn. This Williamsburg diner will be torn down Shame on Williamsburg developer Yoel Schwimmer, who will tear down the last-of-its-kind diner storefront at 221 Wythe Avenue, in the process of turning the lot into a mixed-use building, Crain's New York reports. It's a fate this space has long been waiting for. What was once Wythe Diner has been vacant for years, but it was an architectural feat with its standalone structure in a neighborhood dominated by a sea of new towers. We held out hope that another restaurant would eventually reopen there: From 1997 until 2010, it was a restaurant called Relish. In 2011, Cafe de La Esquina opened before shutting in 2018. Then, as these things go, Blank Street Coffee ran an outdoor coffee cart in the backyard in 2020. In 2023, lights were turned on again by a limited-run activation by Chanel, symbolizing the way the neighborhood is getting gentrified into a luxury district. Large dumpling chain lands in Manhattan Originating in China, with 800 locations abroad, Dumpling Xi has added a second location in New York, following its debut in Flushing a couple of months ago. Now, Dumpling Xi — which originated in Hegang in 2002 — has opened at 71 Fourth Avenue, at East 10th Street, in the East Village. A menu includes dumplings with fillings like zucchini-egg-fried-shrimp, shrimp-fish-roe, and pork-celery. Bring back Soeun When Soeun, the SoHo macrobiotic restaurant, closed in 2019 after first opening in 1971, it prompted public outcry. Following the closing of Lola Taverna, the most recent tenant in the space, a tacky Greek clubstaurant, actress Chloë Sevigny posted on Instagram stories this week asking, “If anyone had a lifeline to bring back Soeun.” For what it's worth, there's still a Soeun in the East Village, but it's not the same."

mov_5D35C92853707131F182725E76A2CF7A,2025-07-09 05:35:44,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]La moda para este verano 2025 nos invita a soñar con vestidos que equilibran comodidad y personalidad, llevándose todo el protagonismo tanto en pasarela como en la calle. Desde los diseños vaporosos lenceros que juegan con encajes y transparencias, hasta los caftanes que reinventan su esencia relajada, cada pieza cuenta una historia propia. Colores vibrantes, tejidos ligeros y detalles que marcan la diferencia —como lazadas, volantes o cut outs— dan forma a una temporada en la que cada prenda es tan versátil como especial. Una combinación que promete looks irresistibles que llevar en cualquier momento del día, pero también de la noche. 112Con el cuello más elegante En las últimas pasarelas de primavera/verano 2025, como las de Isabel Marant, los vestidos de cuello halter se han convertido en una de las piezas más deseadas de la temporada. Ya sean en tejido satinado o en versiones lisas, destacan por su caída impecable y su estética minimalista. Estas creaciones resultan muy favorecedoras por sí solas, pero también se elevan cuando se acompañan de accesorios en tendencia como cinturones que marcan la silueta. Una apuesta versátil y moderna que, tanto en su versión sencilla como combinada con complementos llamativos, es perfecta para eventos de noche o looks de diario con un toque sofisticado. 212Un vestido rebajado que llevar 24/7 Inditex ha sabido captar a la perfección esta tendencia y la ha incorporado a sus últimas colecciones. Entre sus propuestas destaca un diseño muy especial en color naranja de Zara (35,95 22,99 euros) que reinventa la idea tradicional del vestido halter, ya que, además de anudarse al cuello, incluye cut outs laterales que le aportan un toque fresco y original. Esta pieza clave es perfecta para lucirla en cualquier momento del día, ya sea con sandalias planas para un look relajado o con tacones para una ocasión más elegante. 312Dejar la piel al descubierto Los vestidos transparentes han sido una de las apuestas más rompedoras para la próxima temporada. Vienen en todos los largos, con o sin mangas, en punto o gasa, con o sin volantes, y han sido protagonistas en la colección primavera/verano 2025 de Aelis. Además, otras firmas han mostrado looks con esta tipología de diseños en los que los enseñan llevados tanto por cuenta propia, como desabrochados a modo de chaqueta, pero sin top debajo. Solo con sujetador… e incluso sin nada, apostando por la máxima sensualidad y libertad. 412Transparencias de noche (y de día) Así lo sentencia también Parfois con una de sus propuestas más especiales: un vestido marrón en punto abierto (39,99 euros) ideal para la calle o para las jornadas junto a la costa. De cuello redondo y manga larga, sorprende por su escote en la espalda rematado con una fina tira para atar. Su silueta y acabados le dan un innegable aire sesentero que, además de ser tendencia este año, resulta tan favorecedor como versátil. 512Eterno 'tweed' Los vestidos de tweed, como era de esperar, han sido una de las piezas clave que ha mostrado Chanel en su última colección. Estos diseños, que nunca pasan de moda, son los preferidos de celebrities como Carlota Casiraghi o Penélope Cruz, ya que aportan un aire preppy y elegante a cualquier look. Su estructura y textura los convierten en una opción infalible para quienes buscan una estética femenina, sofisticada y atemporal que, además, se puede reciclar con medias en entretiempo e invierno. 612El tejido más 'preppy' Maje también ha hecho del tweed uno de los protagonistas de la temporada, presentando varios diseños que llaman la atención a primera vista. Entre ellos destaca un vestido cortito en tono azul bebé con cuello (335 167,50 euros), que aporta un toque romántico y fresco sin necesidad de añadir ningún complemento. Una prenda que por sí sola protagoniza cualquier estilismo, manteniendo ese espíritu desenfadado, pero cool, que caracteriza a la firma. 712De la cama a la calle Los vestidos lenceros pero con espíritu bohemio, tal y como ha señalado Chloé, acaparan miradas y búsquedas esta temporada. Más allá de los diseños vaporosos de muchos volantes y asimetrías con transparencias que conocemos, los vestidos lenceros se reinventan, casi bajo la dirección plena de Chemena Kamali. Esta primavera/verano emergen en su versión XL con tejidos ligeros y detalles delicados como el encaje, convirtiéndose en una opción versátil que juega entre la sensualidad y la libertad de movimiento. 812Guiños lenceros que aportan sensualidad Son muchas las firmas que han aprendido bien la lección y ya han llevado a sus propuestas diseños de esta índole. Bimba y Lola, concretamente, ha sido una de ellas y ha lanzado una alternativa (135 101, 20 euros) en colores tan apetecibles como el caqui, el amarillo o el negro con una silueta irresistible: largo midi con cierre frontal de botones forrados, escote en V pronunciado, tirantes finos y encaje a contraste en el escote y las sisas, que captura a la perfección ese aire relajado, sofisticado y bohemio que define la tendencia. 912Corto, muy corto También Chloé ha dejado claro que los vestidos babydoll han vuelto con fuerza esta temporada, recuperando ese aire indie y ensoñador que lucían antaño. Y, algunos iconos de estilo tan reconocidos como Alexa Chung (que ya los llevaba en 2010) han traído de vuelta esta prenda de estética naïf, tanto en versiones de manga corta como sin ellas. Su silueta ligera y femenina es perfecta para quienes buscan un toque nostálgico sin renunciar a la comodidad y a un punto de frescura. 1012La vuelta del 'babydoll' Uno de los más llamativos ha sido el que ha incluido Joplin Atelier en su catálogo: un minivestido en cloqué de algodón con tirantes ajustables que incorpora otra tendencia, la falda globo (420 euros). Ideal para looks de invitada o para esas cenas de verano que se sabe cuándo empiezan, pero nunca cuándo terminan. 1112El caftán de los años 60 está de vuelta El caftán ha sido una de las prendas que más han brillado en la colección de Skall Studio para este verano 2025. Su comodidad es indiscutible gracias a los tejidos ligeros y a su patrón amplio que deja respirar el cuerpo. Lo que antes estaba reservado casi exclusivamente para la playa ha evolucionado en una prenda versátil que puede llevarse tanto en entornos casuales como en ocasiones más elegantes. Su estética relajada, sencilla y atemporal permite que funcione igual de bien en una terraza urbana que en un paseo por la arena. 1212Bordado en azul..."

This post's estimated monthly organic search traffic. As content marketers, we spend most of our time sitting in front of a screen, buried in a Google Doc. But sometimes, it's a great idea to leave the desk and socialize with other human beings—ideally on your employer's dime 😉 Conferences are a great excuse to hang out with other content marketers, talk shop, learn some new tricks, and learn how to do less work today with generative AI. Without further ado, here are the biggest and best content marketing conferences happening throughout the rest of 2025. Dates: August 24-26 Think of CEX as the “build-and-monetize-your-audience” bootcamp. Founded by Joe Pulizzi (the guy who literally wrote the book on content marketing), the show is laser-focused on turning writers, podcasters, and video creators into full-blown business owners. Expect success-story keynotes, brutally honest revenue breakdowns, and tactical breakouts on newsletters, community, and productized services. Notable sessions include: Dates: September 3-5 Hosted by content marketing OG HubSpot, INBOUND offers hundreds of talks, deep dives, fireside chats, and meetups on topics ranging from brand strategy to AI. Here's the recap video: You can even watch their previous years' talks on their INBOUND YouTube channel. For example, here's HubSpot co-founder Dharmesh Shah's talk from INBOUND 2024: Dates: September 15-17 Arguably the content marketing conference, Content Marketing World has been pumping out content talks and inspiration for fifteen years solid. Here's last year's recap: Some notable talks from the upcoming CM World 2025 include: Dates: October 2-3 What used to be a single day event in London has expanded to a 2-day event in Manchester, UK, hosted by ProCopywriters (a membership community for copywriters.) Intended for copywriters, creatives, and content strategists, the agenda focuses heavily on the qualitative aspects of content that often go overlooked—creative processes, tone of voice, and creating emotional connections through copy. This year's talks include sessions like: Dates: October 5-8 LavaCon is a content conference with a very technical focus, with over 70 sessions dedicated to helping companies solve “content-related business problems, increase revenue, and decrease production costs”. In practice, that means speakers from Netflix, Lockheed Martin, Cisco, Salesforce, and JPMorgan Chase, and topics like: Dates: October 14-15 2024 was the launch of our first ever fully-fledged SEO and digital marketing conference: Ahrefs Evolve. (Read about how we planned and organized the entire conference here.) Check out a recap of how 2024's Ahrefs Evolve went: This year, we've decided to move our conference to the U.S! This time round, it won't just be an SEO conference; we're going bigger and beyond and getting the best marketing minds to come down for a great two days of tactical talks, panel discussions, and more. If you opt for a VIP ticket, you'll even get a private yacht networking event with the Ahrefs team and all the invited speakers. Pretty cool, huh? I've focused this list solely on in-person, content-specific conferences, but there are a ton of content-adjacent (and even online events) happening throughout the year.

mov_B7422D829E83195C2D8E50DB994D0A95,2025-07-09 09:02:24,en,WEB,"  There's no denying the enduring impact Scotland had on Gabrielle 'Coco' Chanel. It was the spot where, for ten long years, the designer would regularly frequent during her affair with the Duke of Westminster. Spending long weekends fishing alongside her lover and the likes of Sir Winston Churchill (the former Prime Minister once wrote in a letter to his wife that 'She fishes from morn till night & in 2 months has killed 50 salmon'), it is in the Highlands where she first fell in love with the Duke's rural wardrobe, taking cues from his well-worn tweeds for her own designs - a fabric that would soon become synonymous with all things Chanel. It's as paramount to the house's history as the glamorous clientele she would soon be regularly dressing from the intimate salons of the couturier. Today, at the Grand Palais, Chanel chose to honour both of these story arcs with a show housed in a replica of the rooms where Princess Grace of Monaco might have ordered her custom skirt suits in the 1950s, and with a collection peppered to perfection with Scottish riffs. On the front row, Charlotte Casiraghi held court, dressed in a powder-blue twin set; Sofia Coppola arrived with daughters Romy and Cosima in tow; and even Lorde, having just surprised Glastonbury with a surprise set, made an appearance. Maybe we really are having a Lorde Summer after all? It comes at the cusp of a new era of Chanel. The house's latest Artistic Director, Matthieu Blazy, is yet to debut his inaugural line for the house which will come later this year, so in part, today was a swan song of the past few seasons designed entirely by the in-house studio team who took on the responsibility following Virginie Viard's departure back in 2024. Blazy was sat front row himself in support, surely taking note of the impeccable craftsmanship his petites mains will be able to concoct for his October premiere. What came out from the white-carpeted, mirrored-walled, sweeping-curtained oasis was a celebration of Chanel's most timeless élan. A series of elegant, ever-lasting and enchanting ensembles the house's VICs (Very Important Clients) will no doubt be snapping up instantly, quite possibly from the very real couture salon over on rue Cambon. Opening with a sea of delectable cream and ecru hues, shredded-hem tweed dresses made their way down the catwalk paired with sued thigh-highs and chunky walking boots providing a thoroughly modern take on country walk-ware. Then came the all-important twin sets as shades emboldened in golds and forest greens, and finally crescendoing into daring, dynamic eveningwear. There were billowing chemises worn atop gilded ruffle skirts, floral pailette-adorned bodices which tucked into silk tulip skirts, and midriff-baring caped numbers in midnight-coloured lamés that commanded attention from Chanel's most audacious clientele. Finally the crowd bore witness to the new season's bride - a tradition of the house first conceived by the late Karl Lagerfeld in the mid 1980s. For Autumn-Winter '25, she's ethereal, entrancing and otherworldly. Donning a sequin tunic which opened out into a flowing tulle mermaid skirt, her veil was kept in place by one simple white band decorated with beads. She carried a sprig of golden wheat - a symbol that Coco Chanel herself associated with good luck, perhaps from her time spent beside the rolling fields of Scotland. Blazy is soon to blaze sat upon the throne of Paris's greatest fashion empire, but in the meantime, Chanel's Studio Team celebrate all that has come before this moment. © Condé Nast Britain 2025"

[CMN 특별취재팀] 대한화장품산업연구원은 최근 발간한 글로벌 코스메틱 포커스 4호 인도, 인도네시아편에서 “(K-뷰티는) 마케팅 측면에서 현지화 전략을 통해 현지 소비자에게 친숙함을 어필하는 것이 필요하다”고 강조했다.
K-뷰티는 인도 소비자들 사이에서 여전히 트렌디하고 선망의 대상으로 인식되고 있다. 뚜렷한 포인트 메이크업을 선호하던 트렌드가 투명하고 맑은 피부 표현, 은은한 블러셔, 연한 컨투어링 등 자연스러운 한국식 메이크업으로 이동했다.
기미나 잡티 없이 유리처럼 맑고 매끄러운 피부를 연상시키는 한국식 스킨케어도 인기다. 얼굴, 모발, 입술 등 전반적인 피부관리에 한국산 화장품을 선호하는 추세다.
이처럼 K-뷰티의 영향력은 여전하지만 인도 로컬 브랜드들은 소비자들의 수요에 기반한 제품을 개발하고, 유통 채널을 다변화하면서 시장의 주도권을 강화하고 있다. 인도 정부도 신규 브랜드 프로그램과 같은 다양한 지원 사업을 통해 현지 화장품 산업 성장을 뒷받침하고 있다.
K-뷰티, 인도 주류 트렌드로 부상
K-뷰티의 글로벌 확산에 따라 인도에서도 그 영향력은 뚜렷하게 감지되고 있다. 과거 인도 뷰티 시장은 윤곽 강조, 도톰한 입술, 각진 눈썹과 같은 뚜렷한 포인트 메이크업 중심의 서구 스타일이 주를 이뤘다.
그러나 최근에는 K-뷰티 특유의 투명하고 맑은 피부 표현, 은은한 블러셔, 연한 컨투어링 등 자연스러운 메이크업으로 미적 기준이 이동하고 있다.
K-뷰티는 스킨케어 방법에도 영향을 미쳤다. 한국 뷰티의 핵심인 레이어링(Layering) 개념이 인도 소비자들 사이에서 확산돼 예전보다 더 많은 단계의 스킨케어 루틴이 일상화됐고, 이로 인해 인도 시장에서 화장품의 사용량과 카테고리 자체가 확대됐다. 이와 같은 변화는 단지 한국 화장품의 인기 상승에 그치지 않고 현지 기업들의 제품 개발, 브랜드 및 유통업체의 마케팅 전략에도 영향을 미치고 있다.
인도 배우 카리나 카푸어 칸(Kareena Kapoor Khan)과 슈가 코스메틱스(Sugar Cosmetics)의 공동 창업자 비네타 싱(Vineeta Singh)이 함께 론칭한 K-뷰티 콘셉트 기반의 스킨케어 브랜드 퀜치 보타닉스(Quench Botanics)가 대표적인 사례다. 이 브랜드는 메이드 인 코리아를 전면에 내세우며 쌀뜨물, 유자, 대나무 등 한국산 자연 유래 성분을 활용한 제품을 한국에서 생산해 인도에서 판매하고 있다.
나이카는 지난 4월 25일부터 27일까지 아모레퍼시픽 데이를 개최해 라네즈, 이니스프리, 에뛰드 등의 대규모 마케팅 캠페인을 전개했고, 인도 뷰티 플랫폼 카인드라이프(Kindlife)는 올해 자국 내 뷰티 트렌드를 반영하기 위해 K-뷰티 브랜드 유치에 본격적으로 나설 것이라고 밝히기도 했다.
럭셔리 뷰티 제품 수요 급증
커니(Kerney)의 2024년 9월 리포트에 따르면, 인도 럭셔리 뷰티 시장은 아직 초기 단계에 머물러 있어 구조적 성장 여력이 크다. 전체 뷰티 시장에서 럭셔리 제품이 차지하는 비중은 불과 4%로 태국, 베트남, 말레이시아와 같은 아시아 개발도상국의 20~25% 점유율에 비해서도 현저히 낮은 수준이다.
하지만 최근 인도의 럭셔리 뷰티 부문이 대중적인 뷰티 시장보다 두 배 빠른 속도로 성장하고 있으며, 미래 전망도 밝다.
글로벌 럭셔리 뷰티 브랜드들은 인도를 차세대 성장 동력으로 주목하며 적극적인 시장 공략에 나서고 있다. 이러한 흐름은 이미 수년 전부터 이어져 왔지만, 2025년에는 보다 구체적이고 전략적인 진출 사례들이 잇따라 등장하고 있다.
프랑스 명품 브랜드 샤넬(Chanel)은 2025년 5월 기준 총 7개의 부티크 매장을 운영하고 있으며 인도 내 입지를 강화하기 위해 뷰티 플랫폼 나이카(Nykaa)와 파트너십을 체결했다. 2025년 말까지 인도 전역에 위치한 10개 이상의 오프라인 매장으로 유통망을 확대할 계획이다.
일본 시세이도 그룹의 메이크업 브랜드 나스(NARS)도 2025년 나이카를 통해 인도 온라인 뷰티 시장에 공식 진출했다.
입생로랑(YSL)도 2024년 7월에 나이카를 통해 인도에 첫 진출했으며, 같은 해 11월에는 남인도 내 첫 오프라인 매장을 개점했다.
인도 소매업체 릴라이언스 리테일(Reliance Retail)의 옴니채널 뷰티 전문점 티라(Tira)는 인도 럭셔리 뷰티 시장을 본격적으로 공략해 2024년 11월 뭄바이(Mumbai)에 위치한 최고급 쇼핑몰 지오 월드 플라자(Jio World Plaza)에 플래그십 매장을 오픈했다.
위조 및 유해 화장품 단속 강화
불법 화장품 문제에 대응하기 위해 인도 당국은 2023년부터 '사운다라야(Soundarya) 작전'이라는 이름으로 대규모 단속을 진행해왔다.
이 과정에서 라끄메(Lakme), 로레알(L'Oral), 후다 뷰티(Huda Beauty), 메이블린(Meybelin)을 모방한 위조품이 적발된 적 있다.
인도 정부는 2025년에도 인도 전 지역에서 불법 화장품 유통에 대한 대대적인 수사와 단속을 진행했다.
2025년 1월 인도 서부 최남단 해안에 위치한 케랄라(Kerala)주에서는 70만 루피(한화 약 1,120만 원) 규모의 유해 화장품이 적발됐다. 이번 단속으로 33개 업체가 적발돼 법적 조치가 진행 중이다. 압수된 립스틱과 페이셜 크림 샘플에서는 수은 함유량이 법정 기준치보다 최대 1만 2,000배 높게 검출되는 충격적인 결과가 나타났다.
지난 3월 말에는 인도 국세청 산하 조세 정보국(DRI)이 해외에서 밀반입된 중국발 대규모 위조 화장품 컨테이너를 적발했다. 내용물이 신고 품목과 전혀 다른 가짜 화장품으로 확인됐다.
위인도표준국(BIS)은 2025년 3월 델리에 위치한 글로벌 유통업제조 및 불량 화장품 단속의 일환으로, 2025년 3월에 아마존(Amazon)과 현지 대형 전자상거래 플랫폼 플립카트(Flipkart)의 창고를 급습해 각각 8만 1,561달러(한화 약 1억 1,205만 원)와 7,000달러(한화 약 962만 원) 상당의 품질 기준 미달 상품을 압수했다.
이에 따라 정품 유통망 식별을 위해 전자로고(e-log)를 도입한 샤넬의 디지털 기반 위조 방지 시스템 강화 사례처럼, 뷰티 브랜드들은 각자의 방법으로 대응에 나서고 있다.
로컬 뷰티 브랜드 생태계 확장
인도 화장품 시장은 경쟁력 있는 로컬 브랜드들이 두각을 나타내며 새로운 성장 국면을 맞이하는 모습이다. 실제 소비자들의 수요에 밀착한 제품 개발과 유통채널 다변화를 통해 인도 토종 브랜드들이 화장품 시장의 주도권을 확장하고 있다.
2004년 설립된 컬러바(Colorbar)는 2025년 5월 기준 100개 이상의 직영 매장과 쇼퍼스 스톱(Shoppers Stop), 라이프스타일(Lifestyle) 등의 주요 소매점을 통해 1,200개 이상의 매장에 입점해 있다. 2025년까지 수익을 두 배로 늘려 100억 루피(약 1,400억 원) 이상을 달성할 것으로 전망하며, 2027년 초 기업공개(IPO)를 계획 중이다.
대표적인 인도 뷰티 브랜드 라끄메(Lakm)는 인구 구조와 소비 트렌드 변화에 대응해 '미니스(Minis)'라 불리는 소형 패키지 제품군에 주력하고 있다. 소용량 제품은 합리적인 가격, 휴대 편의성, 저렴한 가격으로 다양한 체험을 할 수 있기 때문에 Z세대 소비자층에서 강한 지지를 얻고 있다.
인도는 전체 인구의 약 65%가 35세 이하로 젊은층의 비중이 압도적인 국가인 만큼, 다양한 제품을 부담없이 시도하고 싶어하는 젊은 소비자층을 타깃으로 삼았다.
인도 메이크업 브랜드 매트룩 코스메틱(Mattlook Cosmetics) 또한 디지털 네이티브 세대를 공략하고 있다.
2025년 2월부터 퀵커머스 플랫폼 스위기 인스타마트(Swiggy Instamart)와의 제휴를 통해 10분 이내에 메이크업 제품을 배송해주는 혁신적인 배송 서비스를 제공하며 옴니채널을 구축했다.
지난 3월, 에스티로더 컴퍼니즈(ELC)는 인도상공업부(Ministry of Commerce and Industry)와 정부 주도 창업 지원 플랫폼 스타트업 인디아(Startup India)와 양해각서(MOU)를 체결했다.
뷰티앤유 인디아(BEAUTY&YOU India) 프로그램을 통해 현지 유망 스타트업을 발굴 및 지원할 예정이다.

mov_A2C2D817F4E49490C91ED4C6DA51A113,2025-07-09 10:03:00,en,WEB,"  The industry's elite has descended on Paris once more, to showcase the uppermost echelon of artisanry – the haute couture collections… Chanel Chanel's AW25 collected shimmered with opera‑house grandeur – imagine oversized bows and tassels cascading like diamond fringe, with sparkling embellishments spun into the very fabric of tweeds. The maison's signatures were out in force – plenty of camelias and wheat ear motifs – but it was the pearl adorned boots that truly caught our eye. Ashi Studio Ashi Studio's AW25 couture show in Paris was a lesson in opulence, featuring corseted gowns in duchesse satin and whisper-fine Chantilly lace engineered into architectural forms; their silhouettes balancing power and intimacy with the moody sensuality of Serge Lutens and the opulent allure of Madame Claude. Rahul Mishra Rahul Mishra's AW25 couture collection, Becoming Love, unfolded in Paris as a visual Sufi poem, each intricately hand-embellished look narrating a passage through the seven sacred stages of love, from tender longing to transcendent surrender. Beneath the soaring arches of the Collège des Bernardins, gilded heart-armour, cascading pearl bustiers, lotus-laced sheaths and Klimt-gold halos took hold. Tony Ward Couture Tony Ward's AW25 couture presentation in Paris, titled Entre Rêve et Regard, felt like an intimate exploration of fashion history, showcasing baroque-inspired embroidery, velvet dévoré cut‑outs, and bespoke 3D appliqués that enveloped the body in ultra-romantic sheaths. Corseted waists, voluminous sleeves, metallic layers and sheer lace came together under Hôtel Pozzo di Borgo's grand arches – this was a collection that brought drama in spades. Georges Hobeika Georges Hobeika's AW25 couture show presented a collection founded on soft, otherworldly pastels, each look adorned with lace, feathers, and crystals that made ensemble look luminescent. The father-and-son atelier crafted a story of grief transfigured into grace, beginning with mourning-black velvets and evolving into celestial whites and blushes. Embroidered stars, feathered flourishes, and cascading crystal veils culminated in a final bridal look like no other. Schiaparelli Daniel Roseberry's Schiaparelli AW25 couture collection transported the audience into a mysterious nocturnal realm—using a striking palette of black, white, and silver as his backdrop for provocative anatomical details like a beating heart necklace and eye-adorned column gowns. The collection played with contrasts, pairing sharply tailored matador-inspired jackets and bold sculptural bustiers alongside flowing, bias-cut fabrics, merging the refined grace of the 1940s with the power dressing of the 1980s. This was couture as wearable cinema."
mov_D6AE99848D99FF9D8F74EFB9A9487267,2025-07-09 10:05:14,en,WEB,"  The Victoria and Albert museum is preparing to open the first UK exhibition devoted to haute couture house Schiaparelli. Set to launch in March 2026, the retrospective will chart the history and impact of Italian fashion designer Elsa Schiaparelli, who founded Maison Schiaparelli in the 1920s. It will also explore the present-day incarnation of Schiaparelli, which is now in the hands of creative director Daniel Roseberry. Schiaparelli: Fashion Becomes Art will be staged in the Sainsbury Gallery and comprise more than 200 objects, including garments, accessories, jewellery and paintings. The exhibition, created in close collaboration with Schiaparelli, will be the first of its kind to spotlight the London branch of the house, according to the museum. Highlights include the Skeleton dress, which features quilting resembling large bone, the Tears dress, which features a unique “tear” print, and a hat shaped to look like an upside-down shoe – all conceived in collaboration with surrealist artist Salvador Dali. The exhibition will reference the popularity of Schiaparelli's designs for film and the theatre with artworks by Spanish painter Pablo Picasso, French poet Jean Cocteau, and US visual artist Man Ray on display. Tristram Hunt, director of the V&A, said: “Schiaparelli: Fashion Becomes Art will celebrate one of the most ingenious and daring designers in fashion history. “The V&A holds one of the largest and most important fashion collections in the world, and the foremost collection of Schiaparelli garments in Britain. “Schiaparelli's collaboration with artists and with the world of performance make the Maison and its founder an ideal subject for a spectacular exhibition at the V&A.” Delphine Bellini, chief executive of Schiaparelli, said: “Elsa Schiaparelli's fearless imagination and radical vision redefined the boundaries between fashion and art. “This exhibition celebrates her enduring influence through iconic collaborations with 20th century masters and a pioneering fusion of creativity and commerce. “With its unparalleled collections, expertise in fashion and design, cultural reach, and ability to bridge tradition and innovation, the Victoria and Albert Museum offers the perfect setting to showcase her legacy alongside Daniel Roseberry's creations, which carry her surrealist spirit forward blurring lines with bold, sculptural designs that both honour and reinvent her vision for a new century.” The exhibition is the latest in the V&A's series of major fashion exhibitions which includes retrospectives of Gabrielle Chanel, Christian Dior and Alexander McQueen. Schiaparelli: Fashion Becomes Art will run from March 21 to November 1 2026. Tickets will go on sale in Autumn 2025."

mov_906EC2A9DCD70B505F91499AD8666CBA,2025-07-09 10:44:06,en,WEB,"  While Paris Haute Couture Fashion Week is in full swing, fashion events go far beyond the catwalks. As major fashion houses unveil their most ambitious collections, the fashion capital is also turning into an open-air museum. From Worth to Chanel, exceptional exhibitions immerse visitors in the history, reinventions, and artistic experiences surrounding couture. Here are the must-see events of the season. 1. Worth. Inventing Haute Couture This exhibition, presented by the Palais Galliera in collaboration with the Petit Palais, pays tribute to Charles Frederick Worth, the British designer considered the father of haute couture. In the late 19th century, Worth revolutionized fashion by putting his name on his creations, working on commission, and customizing pieces for individual clients. The exhibition reveals spectacular gowns, archival sketches, and rare documents tracing the birth of the haute couture system as we know it today. A must-see to understand the roots of Parisian luxury. The exhibition “Worth. Inventing Haute Couture” is open until September 7 at the Petit Palais, Avenue Winston Churchill, 75008 Paris. 2. Balenciaga by Demna On Wednesday, July 9, Demna will unveil his latest FW26 collection for Balenciaga, the house he has led as artistic director since 2015. He will officially leave the role the following day, July 10, to join Gucci, a move announced back in March. To mark the occasion, Balenciaga is dedicating an exhibition at the Kering headquarters. Sculptural silhouettes, extreme volumes, and unconventional materials tell the story of how Demna has deconstructed and reimagined couture through a critical lens since 2015. A powerful tribute to innovation that resonates with the house's groundbreaking shows. The exhibition “Balenciaga by Demna” is open until July 9 at Kering headquarters, 40 rue de Sèvres, 75007 Paris. 3. Paul Poiret. Fashion is a Party The Musée des Arts Décoratifs is devoting a major retrospective to Paul Poiret, a legendary early 20th-century designer. By freeing women from corsets, exploring fluid cuts and Oriental inspirations, Poiret revolutionized the female silhouette. His love of parties, exotic settings, and rich textiles shines through in an immersive scenography. Evening gowns, sumptuous coats, and original edition perfumes reflect the boldness of a man who saw fashion as total art. This iconic Belle Époque designer inspired the likes of Christian Dior and Alphonse Maitrepierre. The exhibition “Paul Poiret. Fashion is a Party” is open until January 11, 2026, at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs (MAD), 107 rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris. 4. The New Rotation at Galerie Dior This retrospective gathers 150 designs with original sketches, archives, and photographs, showcasing Dior's rich heritage and the timelessness of its modernity. Through thirteen themes, the exhibition explores the house's universe: from a love of gardens to the magic of balls, from the creative freedom of the Miss Dior line to the artisanal excellence of haute couture workshops. It also offers an immersive experience in the Room of Wonders, designed as a cabinet of curiosities, and highlights Dior's iconic elegance and the captivating aura of J'Adore. Galerie Dior, 11 rue François-Ier, 75008 Paris. Open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., closed on Tuesdays. Last entry at 5:30 p.m. 5. Moda Povera V: Renée's Clothes Olivier Saillard, fashion historian and performer, pays tribute to his mother Renée by transforming her wardrobe into a haute couture collection, blending fashion and memory in a moving performance. Halfway between a happening and an exhibition, this fifth edition of the Moda Povera project invites us to rethink clothing as an intimate, political, and poetic gesture. In a deliberately simple staging, it reconciles a poetic vision of fashion with independence from the luxury system, while delivering an extremely personal and emotional performance in honor of his mother, a taxi driver and part-time seamstress. The exhibition “Moda Povera V. Renée's Clothes” is open from July 10 to 13 at the Grand Palais, Galerie 2, Gabrielle Chanel entrance, Avenue Winston Churchill, 75008 Paris."

mov_5228A499782B17C2ED4278EC163460DB,2025-07-09 10:55:42,en,WEB,"  Malorie Blackman's NOUGHTS AND CROSSES penned as a saga for young adults and published in instalments between 2001 and 2021, serves as the source material for Dominic Cooke's hard-hitting stage adaptation, here directed by Tinuke Craig. Noah Valentine (Callum) and Corinna Brown (Sephy) in Noughts & Crosses. Credit Manuel Harlan. Essentially, this is a loose retelling of Romeo and Juliet set in a 21st century alternative Britain, in which the Noughts are poor disadvantaged white folks and the Crosses are the all-powerful and wealthy black folks. It's a neat premise which requires considerable thinking to embed when read off the page, but when presented in such a charged and visually arresting setting — thanks to the effectiveness of Colin Richmond's drab, pseudo industrial backdrop — the story assumes a vibrant energy all its own. Persephone (Corinna Brown) who is known to everyone save her mother as Sephy, has been childhood friends with a Nought named Callum (Noah Valentine) whose mother Meggie (Kate Kordel) used to clean for Sephy's parents Jasmine (Amanda Bright) and Kamal (Habib Nasib Nader) who just happens to be Deputy Prime Minister of Albion, part of the wider Pangaean Economic Community. The downtrodden Nought (white) population, is mobilising through a liberation movement to press for equal rights and opportunities. Elite schools previously reserved for Crosses (blacks) have begun taking small quotas of Nought scholarship students, and in a nod to the civil rights movement (specifically the Little Rock Nine incidents of 1957) riots and unrest quickly ensue. As Sephy and Callum become ever closer but have to hide their affection at school, they form tentative plans to run away together. Events and society conspire to keep them apart leading to various tragedies including a shopping centre bombing, clampdowns, executions and suicide. For all that this list of misery sounds morose, the drama unfolds in neatly packaged chapters with sufficient humour, charm, variety, pace and choreographed movement across the sprawling playing area, to thoroughly engage the audience. Make no mistake, any attempt to distil such a sprawling epic into a stage play with a running time of 2 hours 50 mins (including the 20 min interval) is no mean feat, but hats off to the creative team who have conjured a substantial piece of thought-provoking, dystopian social commentary, whilst still managing to engage and entertain.

Rachel Burchfield is the contributing royals editor at InStyle, where she covers news about the British royal family on a daily basis, including the work and wardrobes of Kate Middleton and Meghan Markle. Published on July 9, 2025 @ 07:33AM Close Princess Diana at Wimbledon on July 9, 1995. Credit: Getty Long before Kate Middleton took the mantle, Princess Diana was a Wimbledon style icon. The former Princess of Wales first attended the iconic tennis tournament in 1981, just weeks before her royal wedding to Prince Charles, and last attended in 1995, just two years before her death. For that final Wimbledon appearance 30 years ago, Diana wore butter yellow before butter yellow became the it shade, and paired it with standout Chanel jewelry that guaranteed she'd be noticed in the Royal Box. On July 9, 1995—30 years ago today—Princess Diana had just turned 34 years old. That is far too young to have any “lasts.” But, on that Sunday, the Princess of Wales would attend what would ultimately become her last Wimbledon after being a stylish spectator at the iconic tennis tournament since 1981, the year she married into the royal family. Sitting in the royal box in butter yellow, she would have no idea that her summers were limited—only two left to go before her life was snuffed out in a Paris car crash on August 31, 1997. But rather than focus on her death, Diana was living her best life at Wimbledon on that day. For 14 years, Diana's fashion had defined Wimbledon chic, and this was no exception. While there is no official dress code for guests—save for the men being asked to wear a jacket and tie if they're in the Royal Box, and the women being asked to avoid wearing hats so the people behind them could clearly see the tennis happening on the court below—the unspoken dress code is dress well, especially if you're at Centre Court like Diana was that day. “The fashion stakes are high,” Vogue succinctly put it. Getty That day, Diana left behind the polka dots and the oversized power shoulders of the 1980s for a pastel yellow skirt suit, fashion-forward sunglasses, and statement gold and pearl earrings from Chanel. That day, she took in the men's final between Boris Becker and Pete Sampras in a look representative of her fashion evolution, not just at Wimbledon, but as a woman. At previous Wimbledon appearances, she was often joined in the Royal Box by loved ones: Her son, Prince William, the year before; her mother, Frances Shand Kydd; her sister-in-law and friend Sarah Ferguson, Duchess of York; and friends like Catherine Soames. However, in 1995, she chatted with Queen Elizabeth's first cousin, the Prince of Kent. Sometimes Diana's Wimbledon appearances fell on her birthday, July 1, and the crowd would sing to her, but this time, she presented the men's singles trophy to Pete Sampras. Following his victory over Boris Becker, the tennis star—though he was the champion of the day—bowed in the direction of the Princess of Wales, according to The New York Times. Diana loved Wimbledon, by all appearances, and exuberantly took in matches each year she attended, animatedly applauding and giving the signature Wimbledon facial expressions that her daughter-in-law, Kate Middleton, now displays at the yearly event (she's attended every Wimbledon of her royal career save for 2013, when she was heavily pregnant with Prince George). In July 1995, Diana had been separated from Prince Charles for over two years; they'd finally finalized their divorce the next summer, in 1996. Their separation in 1992 was a demarcation point for her style: as Rosie Hart, author of The Royal Wardrobe, put it (via The Independent), “Going into the '90s, the Princess of Wales was under no illusion that her marriage was the fairytale it had initially been framed as. Consequently, the frothy, fairytale elements of her wardrobe, inspired by the traditional looks of the more senior royals, began to disappear.” Princess Diana and the Prince of Kent on July 9, 1995. Getty More structured and tailored looks—like her 1995 Wimbledon suit—became the new norm. Diana, always a fan of butter yellow long before it became the It color of 2025, brought the look out 30 years earlier in keeping with royal tradition (bright colors were Queen Elizabeth's go-to at public events). Kate, too, has adopted yellow at Wimbledon, and, like her mother-in-law before her, can tell a fashion story through her clothes. “It is very surprising how little footage there exists of the princess [Diana] actually speaking,” Eleri Lynn, curator of the Kensington Palace exhibit “Diana: Her Fashion Story,” told Vanity Fair, comparing Diana's style to “an Audrey Hepburn or Jackie Kennedy, a fashion icon whose style is so emulated and so loved, really.” “We all have a sense of what we think she was like, and yet so much of it comes from still photographs, and a large part of that [idea] is communicated through the different clothes that she wore,” Lynn continued, pointing to Diana's affinity for “Cheerful, colorful clothes because she wanted to convey approachability and warmth.” Princess Diana at Wimbledon on July 3, 1994. Getty Prince William and Princess Diana at Wimbledon. Getty Lynn added that Diana “did clearly have fun with fashion, and she took risks…and experimented with her style.” By this point in her fashion journey, Diana “had really sort of transcended fashion and achieved an incredible chic and elegance,” Lynn said, to the point that “all you saw was her, and the clothes became secondary to her own presence and her work.” In the more modern era, Diana's style still resonates. Designers like Tory Burch and Virgil Abloh have created looks inspired by her; Hailey Bieber—one of the most fashion-forward of today's It Girls—once said Diana is someone “I've looked to for style inspiration for as long as I can remember.” Princess Diana at Wimbledon in 1993.

Getty Especially at events like Wimbledon, Diana “spoke to the world so much through what she decided to wear,” Jessica Hobbs, who directed two of the Diana-focused episodes of Netflix's The Crown's fourth season, told The Los Angeles Times. “In my generation, she was such a fundamental leader in the way that you could present yourself as a woman, and I loved her for that.”..."

mov_E63AAA9C64C7CF65791D2ECB69D0C483,2025-07-09 11:43:57,en,WEB,"  I went into this play 'blind' – there were, as others in the press night audience helpfully pointed out, six novels and three novellas in the Noughts & Crosses series written by Malorie Blackman. There's also a drama series based on the novels, still available at the time of writing on BBC iPlayer – six episodes are almost an hour long and four more are fifty minutes long. This play is based on the first novel only, although this is 449 pages long, so there's still a fair amount of ground to cover in an evening. Chanel Waddock (Lynette) and Noah Valentine (Callum) in Noughts & Crosses (c) Manuel Harlan The marketing for this production likens it to Romeo & Juliet: the analogy doesn't quite work for me. There were “two households” but they were not “alike in dignity”. The world portrayed by the play is one of apartheid. The 'Noughts', so to speak, are the 'whites' and the 'Crosses' are the 'coloureds' – except here, the Crosses are the ones with the wealth, the power, the authority, the land, and so on. The Noughts are zeroes, nobodies – noughts. It's an intriguing take on an alternative society, which brings Animal Farm to mind, as the inequalities remain and by the end, things seem worse than they were at the beginning. A Cross, Persephone 'Sephy' Hadley (Corinna Brown), lives with her parents, Kamal (Habib Nasib Nader), deputy prime minister, and Jasmine (Amanda Bright), a socialite who does nothing but drink excessively and gossip with her friends but still manages to make more of a net positive contribution to society than her politician husband. (How much of an alternative universe is this to modern Britain?) Jasmine used to employ Meggie McGregor (Kate Kordel) as a nanny for Sephy and her older sister, Minerva (Jessica Layde), and Meggie's younger son, Callum (Noah Valentine), used to play with Sephy when they were very little. Or to put it another way, when they first became friends, Sephy didn't know Callum was a Nought and Callum didn't know Sephy was a Cross. The twist in the story comes when Heathcroft, a public school for Crosses, decides to accept a small number of Noughts as pupils. Amongst them is Callum McGregor. It's not clear why this happened, given the extremely deep hatred the Crosses have for the Noughts, and vice versa – after all, doesn't the upper caste think the lower caste is, by definition, intellectually challenged? Why educate people who are never going to be given opportunities in later life to use their acquired knowledge? Or is the world in the play ever so slightly less draconian than I assumed it to be? (Given what transpires later, no.) I was somewhat triggered by the school bullies in the show – I suppose very few portrayals of school life are altogether, if at all, positive. All they see is Sephy hanging out with Callum, and how dare a Cross even speak to a Nought, let alone befriend one! This wasn't the first time on this stage that a character was about to be hanged only for there to be a last-minute reprieve – the same thing happened in a production of The Beggar's Opera in 2011. Elsewhere, a subplot about Callum's sister Lynette (Chanel Waddock) is worthy of a separate play in its own right. The production values are high – while some people might be talking unfeasibly loud in a private residence, being able to hear every word clearly completely obliterates that anomaly. The cast are very convincing in their roles. Whether they were planning direct action against the establishment, or delivering a letter, there was a sense of urgency throughout the play. Noughts & Crosses has much to say about tensions in the community, inequalities in society, political inertia, and terrorism in the modern world, amongst other things. A thoughtful, gripping and unsettling production, it's worth seeing. Review by Chris Omaweng 'All our lives criss-crossing but never really touching. A world full of strangers living with all that fear.' Widely considered to be one of the 21st century's greatest novels, Malorie Blackman's best-selling Noughts & Crosses, a bittersweet love story with echoes of Shakespeare's Romeo & Juliet, is revived for the London stage in this brand-new production. By a secluded beach Callum and Sephy meet in secret; life-long friends living on separate sides of a divided world. When Callum, from a Nought family, is accepted to Sephy's prestigious Cross school, will it bring them closer, or will the hate and fear that surrounds them drive them apart?

即日來回，令到Justin convince 到自信。 於是佢就聽老師話，將牛津列為UCAS報名表嘅第一位。 結果？ 結果就係經過面試同A-Level放榜之後，Justin獲得牛津取錄，讀電子工程，已經畢咗業，在倫敦搵到的第一份graduate嘅工，年薪十萬鎊。 後來因為佢對戲劇嘅興趣更大，先至棄暗投明，放棄牛津，返來香港。 希望Justin唔介意我分享呢個例子。 相信到今日佢仍然懷念同埋感謝嗰間在鄉村山林之中、對於香港九龍塘同埋山頂嘅家長屬於寂寂無名嘅小型寄宿母校。 唔好信晒Donald Trump，不一定Big and Beautiful，英國寄宿學校， More and Most Beautiful嘅學校，可能反而好细間。 Small is more beautiful, and large souls always come from small schools。 記住，報讀一間細，而且比較偏僻的英國寄宿學校，絕對唔等於18蚊窮遊香港幫襯兩餸飯，人生嘅Banquet，豐盛的收穫，在後頭。 陳思銘 Samuel Chan

Who are these privileged Crosses, this underclass of Noughts? Dramatised, it's all clear from the start. Blackman's premise is of an inverted society. White people are the despised Noughts, marginalised in a society run by the Black majority. It's a clever idea which allows Blackman to expose the workings of structural racism and its dangerously divisive effects. And centrally, it's a love story between Sephy and Callum – Sephy, a Cross, the younger daughter of the deputy prime minister and Callum from a struggling Nought family. Their friendship began in childhood when Callum's mother worked for Sephy's mother. Dominic Cooke's adaptation, directed for Regent's Park Open Air Theatre by Tinuke Craig, is lively and fast paced, but inevitably, much of the book's subtleties are lost. The action plays out in a sequence of short, punchy scenes, but there is little time for character development. In particular, we don't really see into the inner world of Sephy and Callum, whose voices we hear in the book narrating the chapters alternately. This production has a strong cast, with likeable performances from the young performers, in particular Corinna Brown as Sephy and Noah Valentine as Callum. Chanel Waddock is notable as Lynette, Callum's complex and vulnerable older sister. Other characters tend to be two-dimensional, not giving much scope for the actors. So Alex Boaden does his best with bullying older brother Jude, as do Kate Kordel and Richard Riddell as parents Meggie and Ryan. Amanda Bright gives a strong performance as Jasmine, Sephy's mother, as does Habib Nasib Nader as Kamal, her husband. Craig uses the rest of the cast to haunt the story, always present in the upper regions of the set, ready to spring into action. But this is essentially an intimate story, its focus on the handful of characters whose lives lie at its centre. Colin Richmond's set, with its rusted remnants of tower blocks, presents a bleak world. It's certainly appropriate for the Noughts, though barely suggestive of the contrasting world of the wealthy Crosses. Many of the love scenes take place in secret at the private beach owned by Sephy's family, which can only be suggested by Max Pappenheim's sound design. There's a drabness about the costumes, too, which tends to flatten the distinction between Noughts and Crosses. This production is aimed at young adults, and it has the appeal of an exciting story arc and plenty of dramatic tension. But it's overly schematic and tends to muffle the intimacy of the central love story, which should lie at its heart. Runs until 26 July 2025 The Reviews Hub Score"
mov_6551EDFF0EE7EFDD8E75140625376223,2025-07-09 13:01:47,fr,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[fr]Tout commence au 14ᵉ siècle : le chapeau de paille était alors la coiffe traditionnelle des paysans en Europe et en Asie, qui l'utilisaient pour se protéger la tête des ardeurs du soleil lors des récoltes. Quelques décennies plus tard, sous la Renaissance, il prend du galon mode et pratique et devient déjà accessoire coquet, souvent porté à la campagne : non plus content de protéger du soleil, il permet aussi de préserver la blancheur du teint et se veut synonyme d'élégance. En bref, loin des champs et des insolations, les femmes en raffolent et il ne se limite plus à ses fonctions pratiques. Coco Chanel, Brigitte Bardot, Catherine Deneuve et les débuts mode du chapeau de paille En 1840, c'est le nautisme de loisir qui a le vent en poupe et très vite, sa pratique se propage sur les côtes françaises et les canaux parisiens. Dans son sillage, une déclinaison du chapeau de paille désormais iconique va voir le jour, porté par l'un des grands noms de la mode française : le canotier.

Quando si pubblica un nuovo libro le emozioni sono tante perché il percorso per arrivare fin qui è sempre lungo e non privo di difficoltà, a cominciare dalla fase creativa, passando poi all'editing e, infine, alla stampa. Ore, giorni, mesi immersa in un lavoro fatto con dedizione e passione. Un progetto impegnativo perché ha inglobato non solo la fase di scrittura ma anche quella dell'illustrazione e ora si aggiunge anche la trepidazione dell'attesa di avere dei riscontri da parte dei lettori. Perché quando si pubblica qualcosa, anche un semplice post, ci si espone al giudizio degli altri e, quindi, si diventa vulnerabili. Dopo il diario di primavera, eccoci a quello dell'estate, con tutte le novità che porta nel borgo di Acquachescorre. Come ho già detto per il primo libro di questa serie dedicata alle stagioni, questo diario non è dedicato solo alle adolescenti ma a tutte le donne dai 9 ai 99 anni che non hanno mai smesso di mantenere in vita la “Poppy Spring” che è dentro di loro: il senso della meraviglia, la creatività, l'entusiasmo, la ricerca continua della Bellezza, la gratitudine per le piccole cose. E lo consiglio anche agli uomini che vogliono donare questo libro alle Poppy Spring che hanno intorno. Anche qui Poppy condivide le sue esperienze, sempre con ironia, da sola, con gli amici, con la famiglia. Ci sono i libri, i viaggi, la cucina, il matrimonio di zia Ortensia, le serate nella trattoria “La bruschetta che ti aspetta” e le emozioni tra i fornelli con mamma Genziana e la signora Passiflora. C'è anche la signora Salice, rimasta impigliata nella rete del Romance Scam (la truffa amorosa online) e ci sono i consigli di Pietro Saiber, l'esperto di cybersicurezza. Ma ecco l'indice completo degli argomenti: Giugno Come abbronzarsi senza bruciarsi Nella libreria di Peonia: il gruppo di lettura Luglio Roma…sto arrivando! Coco Chanel, Audrey Hepburn e colazione da Tiffany Ritorno ad Acquachescorre Serata alla trattoria “La bruschetta che ti aspetta”, la cioccolata calda e il comfort food Tre grandi donne: Rita Levi Montalcini, Luisa Spagnoli e Aung Suu Suun Kyi Pic-nic o campeggio? Campeggio: come sopravvivere Agosto L'inaugurazione della profumeria di Miss Tulip Il matrimonio di zia Ortensia e zio Ribes e le stelle cadenti Aspettiamo un nuovo bambino! La signora Salice e il Romance Scam (la truffa amorosa online) Al concerto dei Donkey Monkey! Oggi è il mio compleanno! Granada, zia Mimosa e Gertrude Bell Pietro Saiber, l'esperto di Cybersicurezza Settembre “La cucina di Genziana”: Giacomino Cavanocciuolo e Bruno Lavabicchieri -Emozioni tra i fornelli Le caratteristiche di una MAPS (Migliore Amica Per Sempre) “La cucina di Genziana”: Jane Austen e la torta di mele Londra! “La cucina di Genziana”: Marcel Proust e le madeleines Shopping con Fab! Primo giorno di scuola. Pigiama party! Il compleanno di Lillà Il dottor Rododentro = Ebenezer Scrooge L'estate è finita Il libro è disponibile su Amazon – sia in versione cartacea (QUI) che ebook (QUI) Un grazie enorme e frizzante a quanti, ogni giorno, seguono Poppy Spring perché l'hanno amata fin da subito e a quanti vorranno aggiungersi al suo mondo. L'estate, per ognuno di noi, rappresenta una varietà di esperienze e di sensazioni. Con Poppy Spring è, certamente, più frizzante!"

mov_E84EE8F26685A88322A8A8FA78FE9BA4,2025-07-09 16:13:37,en,WEB,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Molly-Mae Hague has splashed out on a new convertible Bentley as she was spotted out and about running errands in Cheshire on Wednesday morning. The influencer, 26, spared no expense with her brand new £294,000 sports car with smart black alloys and upgraded red calipers. Molly looked at ease behind the wheel as she cut a casual figure in a white collard jumper and wore a full palette of glamorous makeup. During the outing, the mother-of-one, who admitted she struggled to park one of the brand's cars last year, placed her £9K Chanel handbag on the passenger seat. Molly, who has a £6million fortune, was surrounded by cameras on the solo drive filming her for the second series of her Amazon Prime docu-series. Last year in a YouTube video, Molly opened up on her former Bentley experience as she struggled to park the vehicle by the brand. She said: 'It's just very exciting. I believe the car I'm driving is the Bentley Bentayga, I think that's what it is. It's a four-by-four but I'm pretty sure that the four-by-four Bentleys are called a Bentayga. 'But, oh my gosh, I genuinely never ever thought there was ever a car out there that would make me want to switch from my car because the [Mercedes] G-Wagon has always been a whole dream car but this is something else. 'My friend earlier just said that sitting in a Bentley is like sitting in a Chanel bag and that couldn't have summed it up any better. 'The interior of this car is pure luxury and I don't know how to act whilst driving it, put it that way.' However, Molly struggled to fit the car in a parking spot at the Trafford Centre, she added: 'What are we waiting for, loves? What's going on?' She is also the owner of her 'dream car' a Mercedes-AMG G 63 Magno Edition, purchased in 2022 to the tune of £193,000. The reality star has also been the owner of a black Ranger Rover Evoque worth a staggering £32,000, however, after just nine months of using the car, Molly revealed that she was gifting her Range Rover to her sister Zoe. Despite getting her sisters hopes up, Molly eventually revealed she 'put her sensible hat on' and decided to sell the car and buy Zoe a cheaper one. She said: 'It was probably about a year ago that I made a plan to give my Range Rover to my sister because I grew so attached to my last car that I really, really didn't want to get rid of it when I got this car. 'However, I had planned to gift it to my sister before I found out I was pregnant. How do I explain this? If I wasn't pregnant and didn't have a lot of other things to be spending money on maybe I would have still given her my car. 'But I decided in the end to sell my car, which was very sad. I still got Zoe a new car - she's upgraded to an Audi. I didn't give her the Range Rover. I wanted to give it her so I could still see it but I just had to put my sensible hat on.' The influencer has been regularly slapped with parking tickets and last month was given two within the space of 24hours. The TV personality has also received parking fines in March, February and January of this year. The former Love Island star revealed she'd begun shooting the second season of her documentary series, Behind It All, last month. The Prime Video series saw the influencer give fans a glimpse into her life, from running her clothing brand to parenting two-year-old Bambi. She shares her daughter with on-again boyfriend Tommy Fury, who she recently reconciled with, after their surprise split in August last year. However, MailOnline revealed last month that the boxer, 26, still won't appear on her docuseries, despite the couple being back together. It was previously confirmed that Tommy is unable to show his face on the Prime Video series due to his contractual agreements with the BBC as he films documentary The Good, The Bad, The Fury, set for release later this year. Molly-Mae confirmed Behind It All would return for a second season last month, after the first became a viral hit at the start of the year. Writing on Instagram, she gushed: 'My mood because it's filming day ONE for SEASON 2!!! 'I can't believe I'm saying this but because of all of your love and support with 'Molly-Mae: Behind It All'… we are coming BACK with another season! Pinch me.' A TV source explained to MailOnline that the second series will be less 'relationship focused' as Molly continues to build her 'business empire' and navigate family dilemmas with mother Deborah and sister Zoe. An insider said: 'Molly-Mae was over the moon that Behind It All was so well received and popular among her fanbase, she's more than happy to continue sharing more personal aspects of her life with the cameras. 'This season will be as jam-packed as the last, with Molly testing living arrangements, taking on challenges, and making some life altering decisions, all while managing her business ventures. 'Viewers shouldn't expect to see Tommy on the show because he still won't appear even though him and Molly are very much together now.' The debut six-part docuseries became the streamer's most watched show on Prime Video by young women aged 18-34. It followed Molly-Mae as she navigated her public breakup from Tommy, who later revealed the reason for their split was because he had been struggling with alcohol addiction. It also tracked the launch of Maebe, Molly-Mae's first fashion brand, and her complicated relationship with sister Zoe, who felt protective over the YouTuber getting back with Tommy before they had properly worked through their issues."

Bad case of ""these are the designers I'm wearing""--I GOT MUSTARD ON MY VERSACE! DID YOU HEAR ME? MY VERSACE! MUSTARD ON IT! 2B. Spotted wearing giant Chanel logo on chain in next episode promos 2C. Don't touch the ""emotional support Birkin""--bitch bring a dog like everyone else. 3. Entire interview dedicated to letting us know she wasn't a gold digger, then presents photo showing younger self coyly seated atop rich old man's lap. OK toots. Just own it. That pic wasn't taken on his break from his janitor shift, it was taken on his private plane. SOMETHING made him attractive... 4. Seems hard working, I like that. 5. Has inserted finger into a chicken, always a handy bon mot to bring up at a baby shower. Props. Martina once again is dragged off to some party where she gamely pretends to support her wife in all her endeavors, including appreciating Kiki twerking in her face and examining the contents of a diaper. Guerdy is filmed crying to Russell about having water thrown at her as though she were the Wicked Witch. In fact, she does highly resemble Elphaba and this could be her ticket to Broadway and being Very Rich, Bitch like Nene's former glory days. Put a pin in that one. Russell expresses concern that Julia, a quote ""very large, tall woman"" was STANDING OVER his beloved while she is still recovering from breast cancer (no statute of limitations on that one I guess). Umm, has he ever seen Guerdy stand up? Aren't they all rather tall other than Marysol and maybe Lisa and Adriana? Speaking of Lisa--praise be to the editors for that magical juxtaposition of Jody and the Furby. I laughed so hard I startled my dog. Marysol has been suspiciously sober this season so far. I'm glad for her, but sad for myself. I wonder if it will last. Larsa stages a phone call with a [s]witness[/s] friend for backup regarding her story about Jody's suspiciously amped behavior at the ""fashion"" show they attended. Was this a no-phones-allowed event? She could have just recorded him and shown us all, but I guess maybe that's discouraged by the editors, IDK. Alexia --I cannot muster up even one giveadamn about her marriage to whatever his name was. If this was the best storyline she could come up with, her days as a HW are numbered."

6f7e152dc05ab7b3ab4208eb7e91717e,2025-07-09 20:34:00,pl,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pl]Od zawsze marzyły mi się perfumy od Chanel, jednak inne wydatki na to nie pozwalały. Teraz nie muszę rezygnować z marzeń. Ta tanioszka pachnie jak Coco Mademoiselle, które urzekło mnie jaśminem i tropikalnymi cytrusami. Kosztuje aż 25 x mniej i trwa godzinami na ciele i ubraniach! [Bi- es Miss Viviane - perfumy jak Coco Mademoiselle od Chanel] Perfumy od Bi-es Miss Viviane mają delikatny, uroczy zapach, który godzinami sunie za nami niczym perfumowy ogon. To zwiewna woń dla każdej, subtelnej kobiety, która kocha kwiatowe perfumy. W nutach znajdziemy przede wszystkim: Nuty głowy: Bergamotka, Pomarańcza Nuty serca: Jaśmin, Róża Nuty podstawy: Białe piżmo, Paczula, Wanilia, Wetyweria Doskonale odpowiada to Coco Mademoiselle od Chanel, który świetnie asymiluje się z tymi akordami zapachowymi. W porównaniu do Miss Viviane znajdziemy w niej takie nuty zapachowe: Nuty głowy: Bergamotka, Pomarańcza, Kwiat pomarańczy, Mandarynka Nuty serca: Jaśmin, Róża, Mimoza Nuty podstawy: Paczula, Białe piżmo, Wanilia [Opinie użytkowników o perfumach] Klienci są zachwyceni zapachem i często twierdzą, że ponowią zakup tych perfum. Przypominają im Coco Mademoiselle od Chanel, które są szalenie uwodzicielskie. Sprawdźcie, jak wypowiadają się o nich na stronie hebe.pl: Orzeźwiające i niezbyt słodkie, na lato w sam raz. Prosty, solidnie wykonany flakon z ładnym korkiem. Moje nowe odkrycie w ostatnim czasie, perfumy świetnej jakości, wydajne i trwałe, godne polecenia. Zapach jest pudrowy, ale dość długotrwały. Za te pieniądze jest ok. Ten zapach skojarzył mi się z perfumami Chanel. Jest cięższy, ale wytrzymuje dłużej. Ten zapach ma przyjemny aromat, który bardzo przypomina mi Coco Chanel Mademoiselle. [Te perfumowane balsamy są idealne na lato] Te balsamy doskonale odżywiają skórę i sprawiają, ze przepięknie pachnie. Zarówno wersja niebieska, jak i różowa od Eveline Cosmetics bardzo szybko się wyprzedaje, co świadczy o ich jakości. Zapachy długo się utrzymują, nawet przy większych temperaturach. Bogactwo olejków roślinnych oraz nawilżających składników aktywnych pozwala uzyskać świetne efekty. A do tego kosztują tak niewiele! Dodatkowo nie można nie wspomnieć o zawartości witaminy E, C oraz kwasu hialuronowego, który silnie nawilża na różnych poziomach naskórka."

17901154509220441,2025-07-09 22:19:46,en,INSTAGRAM,"  Thank you to jessicajudebooks for kindly sending me an ARC of Queen of Vengeance. Blurb “What are you going to do when you find him?” I pause, unsure what my answer should be. But there's only ever been one option. “Kill him,” I say. Slate Life's taught me not to expect much. Handouts, fair treatment, a decent parking spot downtown. But dead last on that list? Lux Colombia-Clarke showing up at my door, looking like a damn fairytale with a score to settle. Her proposal knocks me sideways: find the city's most dangerous drug dealer, and she'll make sure my sister gets what she needs. I'd be an idiot to refuse, but every time her eyes cut my way, something dark and electric stirs in me. She's trouble wrapped in silk, and I'd be wise to stay clear. Good thing no one ever accused me of being wise. Lux Trust me, I can think of better things to do than begging a prime-parking-spot-stealing jerk for help. Like, a million better things. But this leather-clad biker may be the only way to help my brother. If I can endure the boulder-sized attitude he's carrying around. We had a deal. One that didn't include feeling … safe. Protected. Happy. Like, wtf? In no universe do we make sense together. He looks as out of place in a tuxedo as I do in anything other than vintage Chanel. But when we're together, it's like none of that matters. Until, of course, it does. And then nothing will stand in the way of our epic mutual destruction. Queen of Vengeance is perfect for readers looking for: Contemporary romance books Old money aesthetics Small town biker + high class socialite vibes Morally gray characters & darker themes Enemies to lovers Dual POVs Opposites attract Grumpy x sunshine tropes Spicy love stories Bad boy alpha heroes Angsty and emotional stories Queen of Vengeance is book 2 in the Hand of Revenge series. It is not necessary to read book 1, Ace of Betrayal, but it may enhance the reading experience. This story may not be suitable for everyone.

Localizado na Avenida Rebouças, em São Paulo, o espaço contou com a presença de convidados, jornalistas e as protagonistas de Drag Race, desde as dez Queen's que lutam pelo prêmio do programa, até os jurados e a Grag Queen, que apresenta o programa. A Jovem Pan foi convidada para participar do evento, que exibiu, com exclusividade, o primeiro episódio do reality, que será disponibilizado nesta quinta-feira (10) para todo o público. O programa é reproduzido na Amazon Prime. De looks extravagantes, até os mais discretos, as 'Queen's' não mediram esforços para o evento de lançamento. “O look é uma inspiração da Beyoncé, da tour Renaissance, ela fez com a versão dos EUA e eu aprimorei para o Brasil porque nós brasileiros não desistimos nunca”, fala Mellody Queen. “Nós temos muita força de vontade, coragem para mostrar a realidade. E nós mulheres pretas e travestis, precisamos crescer na segunda temporada e espero ver mais de nós desbravando a arte drag”, complementa. Mellody foi para o lançamento com um vestido em tule e trabalhado com a bandeira do Brasil. Siga o canal da Jovem Pan Entretenimento e receba as principais notícias no seu WhatsApp! As participantes da segunda temporada são: Ruby Rox, Poseidon Drag, Paola Hoffmann, Mercedez Vulcão, Mellody Queen, Melina Blley, Desirée Beck, Chanel, Bhelchi e Adora Black. A exibição do primeiro episódio foi um sucesso, e o público presente vibrou e celebrou a cada momento que uma nova cena ia sendo exibida nos telões que foram instalados pelo espaço, para que todos pudessem assistir. O clima descontraído e amistoso, apesar de ser uma competição, é o que tomara conta dessa segunda temporada de Drag Race, que promete ser um sucesso ainda maior do que foi a primeira edição. “O elenco está incrível, é um elenco de peso e vocês não podem perder. Podem esperar muita entrega, choro, briga, vai ser tudo muito diferente da primeira temporada”, conta Poseidon, representante de Recife. “As pessoas já estão impressionadas com tudo o que estamos entregando até agora, e podem esperar muito mais porque a segunda temporada tem muita entrega, viemos com tudo porque precisávamos de uma temporada assim”, fala Adora Black, representante de Goiás. Paolla Hoffman Com vivência internacional, Paolla ressalta a diferença entre a arte Drag no Brasil e na Europa. “A diferença da arte drag brasileira para europeia, digamos que é a facilidade de conseguir as coisas, para eles é mais fácil e valorizado”, fala. “Aqui no Brasil, se você não está mainstream, para os produtores ela não é suficiente, e lá fora o que vale é o talento e amor pela arte”, compara. Ela destaca que programa como o Drag Race são importantes para a arte Drag, mas faz questão de enfatizar que esse é apenas um recorde, pois existe muito mais para além do reality.   Ver essa foto no Instagram Poseidon Drag Representante de Recife, Poseidon começou na arte drag em 2011, na sua cidade mesmo. '”Fui participando de concursos, aí me mudei para o Rio de Janeiro, fiz teatro, me formei em duas faculdades: teatro e cinema, e a draga voltou para minha vida”, relembra, acrescentando que a “drag matou o seu eu ator e assumiu o controle”. Poseidon revela que ela é uma mistura do normal com a loucura.   Ver essa foto no Instagram Adora Black Adora Black promete ser um dos grandes nomes da segunda temporada do Drag Race Brasil. Nova na cena drag, ela se sente realizada por, em tão pouco, tempo ter conseguido ser escolhida para participar do programa. Aos 26 anos, ela revela que o nome veio por causa da cantora Adore Delano, e como ela queria um nome com a letra A, abrasileirou para Adoro. Black foi uma forma de realçar a negritude. “Meu diferencial é que a minha drag é 100% eu, porque eu faço tudo da cabeça aos pés e isso dá um toque especial porque conseguir transmitir melhor o que queremos passar com a nossa imagem”, diz.   Ver essa foto no Instagram   Uma publicação compartilhada por Drag Race Brasil (@dragracebr) Melina Blley Apesar do jeito extrovertido, Melina garante que não tem anda de leonina. “Sou zero leonina, isso aí é autoestima porque a gordinha teve que criar autoestima, mas tenho lua em leão”, revela, e jura não ser egocêntrica. “Melina tem como sua maior força a personalidade. Eu amo demais, vivo e sinto demais”, fala, e acrescenta que o Drag Race é a realização de um sonho. “Sou uma drag que ama fazer drag, mas é uma criança viada que viveu muitas coisas e agora realizado o sonho de colocar em prática tudo o que aquela criança viada que ama cabelo e peruca gosta”, explica a representante da Paraíba.   Ver essa foto no Instagram Desireé Beck Desireé Beck completou 10 anos de carreira, e já realizou um dos maiores sonhos: ser inspiração para outra draga. “Esse é o maior fechamento de ciclo da vida porque quando começamos, procuramos nossa referência para que a gente e possa engolir e jogar para fora toda a nossa arte”, fala...."

Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening."" – Coco Chanel. This quote perfectly encapsulates the idea that clothing is more than just fabric; it's a reflection of our values, lifestyles, and the world around us. And in recent years, a powerful shift has been taking place in the way we approach our wardrobes, driven by a desire for comfort, versatility, and self-expression. The Rise of Comfort Culture For a long time, fashion was often synonymous with formality and sometimes, discomfort. Think restrictive suits, sky-high heels, and fabrics that prioritized aesthetics over ease. But as our understanding of well-being evolves, so too does our appreciation for clothing that supports our physical and mental health. This has fueled a surge in demand for comfortable and functional garments. We are increasingly prioritizing how clothing makes us feel, both physically and emotionally, understanding that feeling good in what we wear can positively impact our mood and productivity. Key Takeaways: •   Prioritizing Well-being Clothing choices are increasingly linked to a desire for self-care and comfort. •   Impact on Mood Comfortable clothing can positively influence our overall sense of well-being. •   Functionality is Key Consumers are seeking garments that support their active lifestyles.The Blurring Lines of Fashion Categories The traditional boundaries between workwear, casual wear, and activewear are becoming increasingly fluid. We now seek pieces that can seamlessly transition from the boardroom to the yoga studio, offering both style and functionality. This has led to innovative designs that incorporate features like moisture-wicking properties, stretch fabrics, and wrinkle-resistant materials. These materials and designs allow us to be prepared for our busy days. The rise of athleisure and the increasing acceptance of more casual attire in professional settings have further accelerated this trend. Key Takeaways: •   Versatility is Essential Garments that can be dressed up or down are highly sought after. •   Athleisure Influence The popularity of activewear has impacted the design of everyday clothing. •   Adaptable Fabrics Innovative materials are enabling clothing to perform across various activities.Clothing as Self-Expression Beyond comfort and functionality, clothing also serves as a powerful medium for self-expression. The vast array of styles, colors, patterns, and textures available allows individuals to showcase their personality and values. From bold prints to minimalist designs, our clothing choices can communicate our individuality to the world. This emphasis on personal style is further amplified by social media, where individuals share their unique looks and inspire others to embrace their own creativity. Key Takeaways: •   Personalization Matters Consumers are seeking garments that reflect their individual style. •   Visual Communication Clothing serves as a non-verbal way to express our personality and values. •   Social Media Influence Online platforms inspire individuals to experiment with their style and embrace self-expression.

Entre les crayons à lèvres qui débordent, les injections parfois trop visibles, et les gloss collants, l'envie d'un volume “naturel” semblait presque utopique. Et puis la Corée est arrivée, une nouvelle fois, avec une idée simple, élégante et d'une redoutable efficacité : le Blurred Lips. Littéralement, ""lèvres floutées"". Une technique à la fois visuelle et sensorielle pour un effet ""bouche mordue"" qui casse les codes occidentaux du maquillage en misant sur la subtilité plutôt que sur l'exagération. Le Blurred Lips, c'est quoi exactement ? Née dans les backstages des plus grandes marques de K-beauty (Etude House, Peripera, Hera…), la tendance a explosé avec l'avènement de TikTok et des tutoriels viraux venus d'Asie. Le principe ? Un dégradé de couleur qui part du cœur des lèvres pour se fondre progressivement vers les contours, créant ainsi une illusion de volume doux et aérien.

F91233A6BD66151447D65234597CA668,2025-07-10 08:23:14,en,PRINT,"  In the sports world, some wives and girlfriends are more famous than the athletes they are watching. Fashion brands have noticed. As Wimbledon was underway this week, with players adhering to the tournament's strict all-white dress code, fashion watchers turned their attention to the stands, where personalities like Morgan Riddle, the fashion influencer and girlfriend of the American tennis player Taylor Fritz, brought a slightly bolder look to the Grand Slam. On Monday, the tournament's first day, Ms. Riddle wore a blush pink mini dress by Patou, paired with matching strawberry-adorned mules (a nod to the tournament's well-known strawberry and cream dish) and a red Chanel purse. Her blond hair was tied into a half up, half down style with face-framing tendrils. ''If I dressed incredibly inappropriately for Wimbledon, it would be blasted on social media almost instantly and people would probably troll him for it,'' Ms. Riddle said in an interview, referring to Mr. Fritz. Her wardrobe teems with skirts, dresses, blazers and button-down shirts from brands like Thom Browne, Miu Miu and Burberry -- a far cry from her early days on tour with Mr. Fritz, whom she began a relationship with in 2020. Back then, Ms. Riddle, who did not grow up watching tennis, favored jeans, crop tops and sweatshirts. But as she became more enmeshed in the world of the elite sport, her style evolved to meet its expectations. While Wimbledon does not enforce a dress code for spectators, attendees are encouraged to dress ''smart.'' For men, that typically means tailored separates in muted tones; for women, sundresses and low heels. Ms. Riddle takes it a step further. She is polished from every angle, with every sartorial detail deliberate. That's partly because she is a WAG. The term WAG, an acronym used to refer to the wives and girlfriends of sports stars, gained popularity in the British tabloids in the early 2000s, when it was often attached to the glamorous partners of male soccer players. It reached a fever pitch during the 2006 World Cup, when figures like Victoria Beckham were covered almost as closely as the players themselves were. WAGs have taken on a second life in the American sports world, linked to basketball, football and, more recently, Formula 1 and tennis. Vogue called the summer, packed with the N.B.A. playoffs, the U.S. Open, the Stanley Cup and more, ''WAG season,'' spotlighting figures like Jordyn Woods, an influencer and the girlfriend of the Knicks star Karl-Anthony Towns as well as Kendall Murray, whose partner is Braiden McGregor of the New York Jets. Publications like Glamour published ''get the look'' edits inspired by Taylor Swift's game day outfits as she watched her boyfriend, Travis Kelce of the Kansas City Chiefs, play. Fashion brands have taken note. They're not just dressing the athletes anymore, but their partners, too -- for games, appearances and front rows. Reformation leaned in directly, debuting a collection last month designed for tennis spectators with the tagline: ''Those who can't play, watch.'' As interest in the styling choices of WAGs grows, the question becomes: What even is WAG style? Andrew Pokorny, a television producer who worked on ''WAGs Miami,'' a reality series from E! that aired in the mid-2010s, said that while there was not a singular look, most WAGs followed styling codes. For him, it comes down to one thing: projecting wealth. ''The bank account that they have access to, either through marriage or because they've been given beautiful gifts by their partners, does signal access to an elite club,'' Mr. Pokorny said. Bags from Louis Vuitton, Hermès and Fendi are mainstays, as are shoes from Christian Louboutin. But the illusion of wealth matters, too. According to Mr. Pokorny, many women on the show did not want to be seen in the same outfit twice, and they often worked with fast fashion companies like Fashion Nova to maintain the appearance of an endless wardrobe. In 2016, when the show was filming, that led to some flashy choices. But today's most visible WAGs opt for a more understated look. ''Whether it's ostentatious or subverted, it's always intentional,'' Mr. Pokorny said. '' These WAGs know that people are looking at them. It just depends on what's called for at the time.'' The performance of femininity is also crucial to WAG style, said Judy Liao, a professor at the University of Alberta who researches the sociology of sport and gender. In elite men's sports, women have traditionally been sidelined, seen by many as accessories helping to bolster their partner's masculinity rather than as ardent fans or active participants. What a WAG wears, and how she carries herself, can play a key role in that performance, Dr. Liao said. She sees the resurgence of the WAG as partly a pushback to the growing visibility of women's sports and of bodies that fall outside what she calls the Western ideal of femininity and heteronormativity. ''They're too strong, too Black or too queer,'' she said. '' That's still slightly challenging for the North American mainstream audience to really digest.'' ''WAGs really kind of offer the mainstream media this really good material to say, 'We support gender equality because we're showing women in sport,''' Dr. Liao added. '' But it's not the women who are actually playing the sports.'' Athletes themselves have noticed. In April, Daria Saville, the Australian professional tennis player, took to TikTok to express frustration over women tennis players being passed over for brand partnerships in favor of WAGs. Women who, she said, fit the tennis aesthetic that brands were profiting from. There has been, however, a growing trend of brands tapping women athletes for campaigns and endorsement deals. They include the W.N.B.A. player Angel Reese (Good American), the tennis star Coco Gauff (New Balance) and the rugby player Ilona Maher (Maybelline). But WAGs continue to thrive, with some developing larger social media followings than their partners. Sartorially, though, most roads lead back to the athlete. Dressing often becomes a form of fashion diplomacy, echoing the way political spouses represent their partners abroad...."

According to Robb Report Saks Global is “Losing Luxury Shoppers” Saks Fifth Avenue and Neiman Marcus- once synonymous with #American #luxuryretail -are struggling to stay relevant in a transformed retail landscape. Meanwhile, the market has moved on. European maisons like LVMH Kering CHANEL Brunello Cucinelli Zegna Valentino Moncler …are reducing their exposure with Saks Global - scaling their own boutique networks and DTC strategies. Online players like Mytheresa (ironically once owned by Neimans) offer luxury access and continue to take market share… and in the contemporary space, independent specialty retailers like Aritzia and EVEREVE are winning over style-savvy consumers with great product, experiential retail and strong community connection—something Saks and Neimans once owned. Is the era of US Luxury Multi-Brand dominance is ending? The question isn't if Saks and Neiman will change—it's whether they still can… More troubling news; “S&P Global Ratings downgrades Saks, warns latest financing deal is 'tantamount to a default' #LuxuryRetail #RetailReckoning #SaksFifthAvenue #NeimanMarcus #DTC #FashionIndustry #RetailTransformation #HardTruths #Aritzia #EVEREVE #ClientFirst Now would be a good time for LVMH to buy Bergdorf Goodman raise much needed cash and it makes zero sense to have BG and SFA five blocks apart. And for Saks Global to spin off Neiman Marcus it makes zero sence to have both retailers in practically every same location - Could Amazon end up owning Saks Global ??? And Vogue ????"
92696b3b2787e977f0324a31ab1ad9ed,2025-07-10 11:36:00,en,WEB,"  The beauty industry has evolved into one of the most dynamic and profitable sectors in the global economy. Fueled by innovation, celebrity endorsements, social media influence, and shifting consumer preferences toward skincare, sustainability, and inclusivity, cosmetics brands have grown into global powerhouses. While thousands of brands exist, only a few dominate the global market in terms of brand value, reach, and consumer loyalty. Here are the top 10 most valuable cosmetics brands in the world in 2025, based on market presence, revenue, brand equity, and global influence. 1. L'Oréal (France) Estimated Brand Value: $12.5 Billion L'Oréal remains the undisputed leader in the global cosmetics industry. With a presence in over 150 countries and a vast portfolio of sub-brands (including Lancôme, Maybelline, Kiehl's, and Garnier), L'Oréal offers products for every skin type, budget, and beauty need. Their innovation in skincare, haircare, and makeup is unmatched, and the company continues to invest heavily in research and development. Their forward-thinking digital campaigns and sustainability initiatives — such as refillable packaging and green chemistry — have also strengthened their reputation among younger, eco-conscious consumers. 2. Estée Lauder (USA) Estimated Brand Value: $10.3 Billion Estée Lauder Companies owns a prestigious range of beauty brands, including MAC, Clinique, Bobbi Brown, La Mer, and Tom Ford Beauty. Known for luxurious skincare and elegant branding, Estée Lauder has secured a loyal base of affluent consumers worldwide. What sets them apart is their strength in high-end skincare and fragrances, and their aggressive push into emerging markets like China and India. Their digital transformation, especially during the pandemic, positioned them as a strong e-commerce player in the luxury beauty space. 3. NIVEA (Germany) Estimated Brand Value: $7.5 Billion Owned by Beiersdorf, NIVEA is a heritage brand with global recognition and trust. Known primarily for its skincare and body care products, NIVEA is especially dominant in Europe, Asia, and Latin America. While not a luxury brand, NIVEA's consistent quality and affordability give it massive global appeal. The brand has recently focused on developing sensitive skin-friendly formulations and expanding into men's grooming, increasing its reach across demographics. 4. Chanel (France) Estimated Brand Value: $6.8 Billion Chanel is the epitome of timeless luxury. Though more famous for fashion and fragrance, Chanel's cosmetics division — including foundations, lipsticks, and skincare — is among the most coveted in the world. The Chanel №5 perfume remains one of the best-selling fragrances globally. What elevates Chanel's value is exclusivity. Its limited product drops, premium pricing, and elegant in-store experiences ensure it remains aspirational and rarefied. 5. Dove (UK/USA) Estimated Brand Value: $6.2 Billion A Unilever brand, Dove is widely recognized for its inclusive, real-beauty approach. Famous for body washes, deodorants, and moisturizing products, Dove markets itself on self-esteem, confidence, and body positivity. Its messaging resonates strongly with Gen Z and millennials who favor authenticity over airbrushed perfection. Dove's initiatives such as the “Real Beauty Campaign” and sustainability goals contribute significantly to its brand equity. 6. Clinique (USA) Estimated Brand Value: $5.7 Billion A subsidiary of Estée Lauder, Clinique is one of the pioneers of dermatologist-developed skincare. It's known for its “3-Step Skin Care System” and hypoallergenic, fragrance-free products. Clinique has successfully positioned itself at the intersection of clinical credibility and beauty, which appeals to consumers who are ingredient-conscious and result-driven. Its expansion into clean beauty and focus on men's skincare has kept it relevant in a fast-changing market. 7. Shiseido (Japan) Estimated Brand Value: $5.3 Billion..."

This prestigious occasion called for a look just as special, and the actor delivered with a killer beauty beat and ensemble—all Chanel, of course. Hannah opted for a bouclé blazer dress with jewel embellishments, modernised with a sheer tulle dress layered underneath, the eclectic look reminiscent of Carrie Bradshaw's '90s style. Her natural beauty look, comprised of her blonde hair styled in barely-there waves and radiant makeup, provided a softer contrast to the structured ensemble. The Bridgerton actor is currently staring alongside Rob Madge (star of My Son's a Queer But What Can You Do?) as leading role Sally Bowels in the West End show. The special performance at The Kit Kat Show marked the 1,500th performance of Cabaret.

Hannah's makeup was fresh and radiant for the event (Image credit: Hannah Dodd/Chanel) ""We focused on fresh, dewy, healthy skin,"" Hannah told us, crediting some Chanel beauty classics for her glowy makeup look. ""We used the Chanel bronzing cream and the lip balm in peach,"" Hannah continued. ""I love peach colours! And a flick on the eye for a fresh look."" A flawless makeup look starts with a good base, a concept that skincare enthusiast Hannah champions. ""I love skincare,"" she continued, before adding, ""But I have to rein it in sometimes.

It's become a way of disconnecting from the character and work and settling down."" Hannah credits London-based makeup artist Sara Hill for her soft and dewy makeup look. ""I'm very lucky to work with my makeup artist, Sara Hill, whom I have absolute faith and trust in. I love everything she does."" Chanel's beauty range was used to create Hannah's look (Image credit: Chanel) Praising the power of a natural base, Hannah continued: ""I love when your skin looks dewy, glowy. I have a few freckles, and I love it when they have the chance to show through!"" The actor then added: ""A fluffy brow, but with lips and eyes; I love experimenting depending on the event."" And Hannah's must-have beauty products? ""My desert Island products would be an SPF and a lip balm. When I'm going minimal, I just love brushing my eyebrows up, a little bit of concealer and curling my lashes is my absolute go-to!"" Hannah Dodd wearing Chanel for a Cabaret Gala at the Kit Kat Club in London (Image credit: Hannah Dodd/Chanel) The French fashion house is, of course, known for its iconic suits, so it's no surprise that Hannah was dressed in a classic tweed jacket with the brand's signature sharp tailoring. Opting for a blazer dress instead of an evening gown held particular significance for the actor. ""The suit is quite a symbol that's used throughout the show,"" Hannah told us. ""I love tailoring anyway, but it felt like a really nice nod to the production."" The perfect blend of Chanel's vintage and modern styling. Under the blazer, Hannah wore a tulle, floor-length dress underneath from Chanel's Fall/Winter 2024/25 ready-to-wear collection (Image credit: Hannah Dodd)..."

Coco Chanel as fearlessness, daring and risk, as well as taste, philosophy and brand. Mario Radachevsky's contemporary ballet about a woman who profoundly influenced the world of fashion. As a choreographer, he has in the past been fond of full-length titles inspired by the lives and works of great figures of human cultural history. We can recall the titles of ballets by Warhol, Beethoven, Michelangelo. Now his creative attention has been captured by an extraordinary woman who, by changing the wardrobe of the modern woman, has turned the world of fashion upside down. Her journey to the top, as it is with exceptional people, was painful, thorny, but for choreographer Mario Radachevsky the most important word of characterization is that she was real, genuine. In today's world, we often give up without a fight because it's easier, more comfortable. Many of our decisions are postponed because they arouse the need for self-denial. But the road to success knows no shortcuts. And the story of Coco Chanel can serve as an example and is proof of the importance of the endurance factor of determination and clear direction to go for your goal and be able to sacrifice and submit almost everything for success. The choreographer is fascinated by the reach of Coco Chanel's influence and significance, her ability to transform her field in such a way that we perceive with exaggeration the world of fashion before and after Chanel. As with most of his productions, Mário Radačovský work with his proven Slovak design team. Marek Hollý will be the set designer and Ľudmila Várossová has accepted the tempting challenge of costume designin the spirit of Coco Chanel.

Cendyn, a global integrated hotel technology and services company, is delighted to announce a partnership with Singapore-based boutique hospitality company – Naumi Hotels – as it prepares for expansion with a brand refresh and investment in its digital real estate. Marking 18 years since the opening of its flagship Naumi Hotel Singapore, Naumi is launching a new website and promotional campaign accompanied by new visuals to drive home the USP of design-led boutique properties. With seven hotels in Singapore, New Zealand, and Australia, the boutique hotel portfolio is set to continue its international expansion in 2025 – bringing the Naumi experience to new destinations around the world. Naumi will benefit from Cendyn Web services enabling the brand to come to life through design-led digital visual experiences. The boutique hospitality portfolio will be able to leverage first-party data from various sources, including the booking engine and stay data, to optimize user experiences. By fully showcasing its unique hotel story on a fully customized and immersive branded digital experience, advanced personalization will give Naumi Hotels the ability to tailor content, offers, and imagery to audience preferences, assisting in driving direct bookings and overall visitor satisfaction. “We have reached a point where the digital experience needs to reflect the stay experience,” said Group COO, Paul Stocker, Naumi Hotels. “We want to bring our bold brand to life online. Cendyn's design sensibility and technical execution along with the intuitive and user-centric CMS platform was a major factor in our decision. Not only does Cendyn provide essential data security, but it empowers our team with seamless content control without compromising on design or functionality. “We were looking for a partner that could grow with us. Cendyn's platform gives us the flexibility and scalability we need to support our continued expansion across key markets. We've been incredibly impressed by the level of account support and customer services the team has received.” “Naumi Hotels can now communicate its distinctive, design-led identity and unique guest experiences through its digital asset – this was clearly necessary and timely for the brand,” said Rick Posey, Senior Director, Reporting & Analytics – eCommerce, Cendyn. “The team can now better collaborate across the portfolio by giving each property access to make website updates for the menu, F&B promotions, campaigns, operating hours etc while allowing the central team to review and publish. Naumi will be able to drive more direct bookings with special packages and personalized experiences at every stage of the guest journey.” Founded in 2007, Naumi blends bold design with personal, heartfelt service for immersive stays tailored to the modern traveler where rooms are inspired by influential cultural phenomena including Madonna, Coco Chanel, and Andy Warhol. Built around the idea of creating unforgettable memories for every guest and inspired by the principles of individuality, design innovation, and impeccable service, the brand embodies a philosophy of making every stay bespoke and extraordinary. Naumi Hotels plans to roll out the new website and brand identity in September ahead of its 18th anniversary of the opening of the 73-room flagship hotel, located in Singapore's vibrant city center.

n2fpv51,2025-07-10 21:15:03,en,REDDIT,  Dillinja got his sound by slamming the inputs on his dat recorder. They're digital but it worked. Pretty sure the channels on ableton don't clip. But what does clip is a bunch of Chanel's clipping then hitting the master and clipping that too. I've also noticed bad kind of clipping between plugins if they're clipping their output. Anyway - long story short - I've heard ableton clip in a bad way. So I always gain stage everything to 0 then have the faders around -6. If it clips the master I just turn that down 3db too. Gain staging to zero means you get accurate results within channels at the plugins. A signal hitting the compressor for eg will come in at 0 so you know when you turn the threshold down to -15 it's actually -15 into the signal you want to compress. If that makes sense. Gain staging

n2h02i2,2025-07-11 01:28:48,en,REDDIT,"  I would start out by calling every supplier representative who will answer the phone. Tell them you are starting out and trying to understand the quality, concentration, and ingredients of perfume oils before making a purchase. Take notes. The industry must have a general way of describing what they have. There is probably quite a bit of puffery, but the more knowledgeable you are, the more you will be able to narrow down what you need. I have learned a lot by keeping things open-ended and letting a vendor educate me. I've made the mistake of asking questions that are too specific, and due to my lack of knowledge, I didn't get the whole picture. You can start broad and then drill down. I would also ask if they provide samples. You can't buy without knowing if it smells good. Just because you think it smells good doesn't mean other people will like it, so get friends, family, or pay people $5 on the sidewalk for their opinion. Also, try r/fragrance and r/perfumery They are probably snobby but filter through the nonsense, and you should get a consensus on standards, recommended suppliers, etc. You can Google each subreddit with a keyword and find things as well as the Reddit search. I lived in Australia for about 3 years and had a business selling high volumes of cheap perfume. One time, I counterfeited a bunch of Chanel perfume with nice packaging. I ordered plain bottles filled with a Chanel clone, then put on embossed Chanel stickers. I had packaging as well. The Chinese immigrant packaging suppliers only cared about the fact that I paid in cash, lol. I rented a nice convertible and put magnetic Chanel stickers on it. I sold that stuff in flea markets with the ""Chanelmobile"" parked in the stall with ribbons and bows. The ladies loved it, and nobody ever returned it or complained. That was over 30 years ago when I was a young man hustling my way around the globe, pillaging as I traveled. The difference between a quality perfume and crap is obvious to me after selling so much of it, but the average person is pretty clueless. I've sold an unbelievable amount of stinky garbage. That's Australia. Other places might be different. They had high tariffs on imported goods, so they were expensive, and the country is isolated. Also, a bit redneck in their own way. Also, you might need r/packaging and a Chinese liquid filling machine off Amazon for less than $100. Unless you're planning on really cranking out product, a cheap machine will get you started. You probably already know this. Also, if you're going to print on bottles, use a Chinese pad printer and a cheap compressor. There are YouTube videos on the process, and suppliers will educate you and sell you a printing plate, ink, solvent, and silicone pad. Also, buy a small scale off Amazon for measuring the ink. It's a cheap and easy process, and you can get a Chinese pad printer off Amazon for a few hundred dollars. That's a lot more than you asked for, I hope it helps. Feel free to ask questions. Good luck in your endeavor."

The former gymnast has been keeping herself busy with new ventures after retiring from the sport. Dunne announced her retirement from gymnastics following her fifth-year appearance with the LSU program. For the event, the former gymnast was seen opting for a white outfit, coordinating a tank top with a white mini skirt. She paired the look with minimal yet statement jewelry, including heart-shaped earrings and bracelets. She completed her look with a white luxury Chanel handbag. Flaunting her attire, she shared a mirror selfie on her Instagram story. Screenshot of Dunne's Instagram story.

""It was always a goal of mine"" - Olivia Dunne makes her feelings known after receiving the honor of Time's Top 100 Creators list Olivia Dunne attends as the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Social Club celebrates the launch of the 2025 Issue. (Photo by ) Olivia Dunne was recently named in Time's Top 100 Creators list. She received this honor alongside Ilona Maher, Mr. Beast, Joe Rogan, IShowSpeed, Charli D'Amelio, Alix Earle, and Khaby Lame. The former collegiate athlete received this honor for her incredible presence on social media, accumulating a massive following of 15 million across her social media platforms. Following the achievement, she stated how she broke the stigma and became the highest-paid collegiate athlete when it was least expected from a gymnast. “It was always a goal of mine to get that blue check mark on Instagram,” Dunne, said. “I actually drew it on a piece of paper, cut it out, and stuck it on my mirror.” “I can tell you one thing, nobody expected a gymnast to be at the forefront of NIL and collegiate athletics,” said Dunne. “Breaking down barriers and beating everyone's expectations was very fun. The legacy that I'm leaving, I hope it's bigger than me.” (via time.com) Following the retirement, Olivia Dunne now wants to focus on modeling, acting, and longer-form YouTube videos.

Dunne has been busy making the most of her NIL commitments since her retirement. She featured on the cover of Sports Illustrated Swimsuit magazine this year and has been making rounds on the internet for her viral catwalk in Miami. She's also supporting the Pittsburgh Pirates pitcher by making regular appearances at his games. On Thursday, Dunne hit the streets of SoHo, New York and posted stories on social media. She rocked a white one-piece mini dress, complementing her blonde hair with a white Chanel handbag slung over her shoulder. Moments later, she shared a behind-the-scenes glimpse from what appears to be a Sports Illustrated Swimsuit shoot prep area. She tagged the location as SoHo, New York, and scribbled “Sports Illustrated Swimsuit"" in the story. On Wednesday, Olivia Dunne earned the honor of being among the world's most influential digital voices. TIME magazine named her in its inaugural TIME100 Creators 2025 list. She was placed among the elite “Titans” of the online world. Dunne was placed among the likes of Alix Earle, Khaby Lame, Mr. Beast, Sean Evans and others. She posted an Instagram story, where she expressed that she was ""honored and humbled"" by the accolade. In another story shared, she wrote: While she continues to make strides in her professional career, Pirates ace Paul Skenes made a splash by earning a selection for the All-Star game on July 15 in Atlanta. He's pitching to a 1.94 ERA this season and has gone 4-7 in his starts."

mov_7A09A760BE34D0A506C3D0920372E862,2025-07-11 02:56:58,en,WEB,"  Hello Patrons! :)      So I decided to switch it up today. Instead of giving my thoughts on my current read I wanted to do the Mid Year Freak Out Tag that floats around this time of year. Let's get into it! Best Book You've Read So Far this Year? My Friends by Fedrik Backman. A great return to form from an author I loved in the past. Atmosphere by Taylor Jenkins Reid. I have been waiting YEARS for this book, and I was so scared it wasn't going to be good but it was lovely. Courtesy of Goodreads. Great Big Beautiful Life by Emily Henry. The premise made me pause because it was so like The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo but Henry put her own spin on it and I had a fun time reading it. Curtesy of Goodreads     The Favorites by Layne Fargo. I went in with 0 expectations. I had a blast listening to it at work. I teared up a little at the end. Not full sobs but not just misty eyed. It is so messy but so good! Courtesy of Goodreads     Kate & Frida Kim Fay. I read another book by Fay and learned one afternoon in March she had come out with a new book and I automatically requested it from my library. It is a epistolary historical fiction novel of two women in 1994. It covers the conflict in Serbia and Bosnia. I learned a lot and had a great time reading the book. Courtesy of Goodreads     Best Sequel You've Read So Far This Year? Wild and Wrangled by Lyla Sage. This is technically a finale but I loved it so much I had to put it here! Courtesy of Goodreads     The Ragpicker King by Cassandra Clare. I liked this so much better than book 1. I had such low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised. Curtesy of Goodreads     Kills Well With Others by Deanna Raybourn. Fun continuation of a fun series. Older lady assassins fighting crimes being vigilantes. Courtesy of Goodreads     A New Release You Haven't Read But Want To? Better in Black by Cassandra Clare (I sadly have to wait until early December!) These are a return to the Shadowhunter universe with a bunch of short stories! This was a kickstarter project and I am so glad it's coming out in print. Courtesy of Goodreads     Most Anticipated Book for the Rest of 2025? Besides Better In Black, I think my most anticipated release would have to be The Lost Story of Eva Fuentes by Chanel Cleeton! (I only have to wait until September for this one.) It's historical fiction goodness centered on Latina characters. Courtesy of Goodreads     Biggest Disappointment So Far? Curtain: Poirot's Last Case by Agatha Christie. I was just so bored the entire time. Just so anticlimactic. Courtesy of Goodreads     Biggest Surprise This Year? Adventures in the Louvre by Elaine Sciolino. This is a nonfiction book about the Louvre in Paris. Super interesting! Loved the narrator of the audiobook. Courtesy of Goodreads     The Favorites by Layne Fargo...."

The former gymnast has been keeping herself busy with new ventures after retiring from the sport. Dunne announced her retirement from gymnastics following her fifth-year appearance with the LSU program. For the event, the former gymnast was seen opting for a white outfit, coordinating a tank top with a white mini skirt. She paired the look with minimal yet statement jewelry, including heart-shaped earrings and bracelets. She completed her look with a white luxury Chanel handbag. Flaunting her attire, she shared a mirror selfie on her Instagram story. The former collegiate gymnast also visited the Sports Illustrated studio, on the SoHo street, a neighborhood in Lower Manhattan, New York City, known for its designer boutiques, fancy chain stores, and high-end art galleries. She recently walked the runway after collaborating with the brand for the third time. Dunne collaborated with Sports Illustrated for the third time, while also gracing the cover this year. Olivia Dunne was recently named in Time's Top 100 Creators list. She received this honor alongside Ilona Maher, Mr. Beast, Joe Rogan, IShowSpeed, Charli D'Amelio, Alix Earle, and Khaby Lame. The former collegiate athlete received this honor for her incredible presence on social media, accumulating a massive following of 15 million across her social media platforms. Following the achievement, she stated how she broke the stigma and became the highest-paid collegiate athlete when it was least expected from a gymnast. Following the retirement, Olivia Dunne now wants to focus on modeling, acting, and longer-form YouTube videos."

Labubu, a mischievous elf with pointy ears, serrated teeth, and wild hair, was created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung in 2015. Inspired by Nordic mythology, Labubu first appeared in The Monsters' story series. Though the monsters include characters like Zimomo and Spooky, Labubu quickly became the breakout star, especially after BLACKPINK's Lisa flaunted one on her handbag. What pushed Labubu into the mainstream? It's a 2019 collaboration with Chinese collectable giant POP MART. The toys are mostly in the form of blind boxes, so you never know which version you'll get until you open it, making the hunt half the fun. And yes, Labubu is a girl. She's unique: no tail, a toothy grin, and over 300 character variations, from fantasy-themed figurines to dessert-colored plush pendants with movable limbs. These plushies, especially the Tasty Macarons series, have become coveted bag charms in Thailand. Cry Baby, her gloomy-but-cute counterpart, also found fame with fans who relate to its pouty mood and teary eyes. But here's the ultimate flex: Thai collectors are matching Labubus with Hermès Birkins, Chanel crossbodies, and luxury car dashboards. It's high fashion meets chaos, and everyone wants in. From late-night capsule machine queues to Facebook trade groups, the craze is real. Whether you're a toy collector or just Labubu-curious, these pint-sized icons are here to stay in Thailand.

This entire time you have been misrepresenting what I say so it makes me question your literacy skills so I will say it again: I DO NOT GIVE A DAMN ABOUT HIS OPINION. He cares about the opinion of his people and how France is perceived from outside. This is why he jumped on the fact that Clair Obscur is being overhyped. And all the studios I listed had at least a little French involvement but let's limit it to just 100% made by some French studio that had no presidential acknowledgement. Assassin's Creed: only acknowledged because Macaron made a controversial statement regarding video games and he was on damage control. There was no praise for its worth from him like with Clair Obscur. Just Dance: nothing Detroit: Become Human: nothing Life is Strange: nothing Want to go outside of video games? Chanel, Dior, Louis Vuitton: These are flagship French brands and dominate global fashion — but you don't see the president going out of his way to tweet praise about the latest handbag or perfume launch. I can literally go on forever. Presidents don't acknowledge every commercial success. It's unrealistic. Once it's backed by the cultural conversation THEN it gets acknowledgment. That's it."

mov_F8FCCA74C88B4AB29E78E06C44DA60A7,2025-07-11 04:01:00,en,WEB,"  Designed by Peter Marino, the 4,778-square-foot space features expanded space for fashion, watches & fine jewelry and fragrance & beauty. Chanel will reopen its boutique within the Bellagio Resort and Casino in Las Vegas on Friday following a major redesign. Designed in partnership with Peter Marino, the house's longtime collaborator, the 4,778-square-foot, single-level boutique draws inspiration from the city of Las Vegas, combined with the refined atmosphere of Gabrielle Chanel's own apartment at 31 rue Cambon in Paris. Chanel first opened its boutique at the Bellagio in 1998. “For us, Las Vegas is such a dynamic market with incredible clientele and ultra luxe fashion,” said Rebeka McCabe, Chanel's general manager of fashion, in a Zoom interview. She described Vegas as a global destination for business and leisure and hub for top clients, both local and domestic. Last year, Las Vegas attracted 41.7 million visitors overall, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority Research Center. Chanel has three boutiques in Las Vegas at The Shops at Crystals, The Wynn Las Vegas, and the Bellagio Resort, which has the largest Chanel store in Vegas in terms of front-of-house square footage. “What is unique to the Las Vegas market is that we have these three distinct boutiques that service their own unique client base and have a different experience within the Las Vegas market,” said McCabe. “To be able to create these unique environments within the city that enable our clients — both new and existing — to experience Chanel and continue in elevated ways is always a key strategy for us.” The renovated space at the Bellagio features three ready-to-wear try-on rooms compared to the prior two, a ready-to-wear room that can be privatized for clients, a dedicated area for textiles including two walls for eyeglasses (compared to one eyewear wall previously), an expanded shoe salon, and dedicated areas for watches and fine jewelry, and fragrance and beauty. Among other luxury brands that have boutiques at the Bellagio are Dior, Fendi, Gucci, Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Valentino. In describing Chanel's Vegas customer, McCabe said, “They [the customers] have a large propensity to travel — they have multiple homes within the U.S., and we are seeing an increased rise in clients who are making Las Vegas their primary residence.” She added that they previously saw Vegas as having a smaller local and largely tourist customer. “Now we're seeing this beautiful local client develop there, that we're really excited to build a relationship with within the city,” she said. Set between the resort's existing limestone columns, Chanel's newly designed facade features white marble that is sculpted to evoke the elegance of pleated fabric. Adorned with large display windows and accessory vitrines, the textured white stone transitions into a curved black fluted stone showcase dedicated to Chanel fine jewelry. The contrasting display echoes the qualities of the fashion textiles used by the house. The layout encompasses a total of seven individual salons. Marino designed custom hand-woven carpets and textured upholstery fabrics for the space. Upon entering, clients are first welcomed into two areas for leather goods and accessories, followed by two distinct spaces for fragrance and beauty and watches and fine jewelry. There is a dedicated shoe salon featuring a pair of Liane Chandeliers made of 24-karat gold and decorated with hand-cut rock crystals by goldsmith Goossens. In the back of the boutique, two connecting ready-to-wear salons are decorated with custom furniture. The first contains an Ingrid Donat coffee table with a pair of Venini crystal vases designed by Marino, decoratively placed on top. Two Rene Cresson Louis XV Style armchairs are positioned around the table with a Goossens “Zen” table lamp placed on the console behind the custom upholstered sofa. With an ivory textured plaster wall finish, the second and final salon showcases a custom André Dubreuil coffee table as well as a round Thierry Leproust side table between two armchairs. Marino selected a mix of artwork to display inside the boutique, with most placed within the three exclusive fitting rooms. The first fitting room features an oil and enamel canvas by Robert Donatelli, an Italian postwar and contemporary artist. In the vestibule outside the second fitting room, there is a Robert Mapplethorpe frame gelatin silver print. Inside, guests will find a black oil on white linen abstract painting by German artist Chris Succo. Next door, in the third fitting room, is a gold resin and acrylic canvas by Gianfranco Zappettini, an Italian abstract painter. In the watches and fine jewelry salon, a gold modeling paste canvas by Florian and Michael Quistrebert is mounted in a prominent spot behind a desk and three custom upholstered chairs with gold hand embroidery to match. For the boutique's opening, Chanel's 2024/2025 Métiers d'art collection is available. The shop will also feature the new fall 2025 pre-collection. The assortment features silhouettes such as short sporty knit sets, relaxed vintage-inspired denim, rich tweeds, and delicate lace accents woven throughout. Within the watches and fine jewelry salon, a custom crackle lacquer wall mirrors the Coromandel screens in Gabrielle Chanel's apartment. Featured are a selection of the Coco Crush, No. 5 and Camelia fine jewelry collections. The salon also offers pieces from the Ruban and Comète collections, as well as a range of timepieces including the J12 in black and white high-resistance ceramic, and designs from the Premiere collection. In addition, there is a dedicated area that features the full range of Chanel fragrance, makeup and skin care products. Last month Chanel was the first luxury fragrance brand to take to Sphere, the Las Vegas landmark that opened in 2023, as reported. The week-long activation was comprised of a 90-second spot, which aired multiple times daily, for a limited-edition incarnation of No.5 L'Eau. While the new Chanel store was under construction, the luxury brand operated a temporary store at the Bellagio. “The benefit of Vegas is you're always inspired by the energy of the city. I think that generally it's a really nice time to purchase something that reminds you of that visit, or encapsulates the energy of the city,” said McCabe. McCabe expects a “high penetration in ultra-luxe items” to be bestsellers. “With this expanded ready-to-wear assortment and fitting rooms, we'll have a strong representation of runway looks from Métiers d'art, complemented by a selection of elevated jackets and knits that I think will be very impactful. And we'll have other key leather good styles from Métiers d'art, including a strong selection of Chanel 25 [The hobo-designed Chanel 25, available in three sizes, adopts three of the signature codes of its forerunners: the quilted leather, the braided chain and the pockets], and nano shopping [handbag] in a variety of colors which we also think will be very impactful in the market,” she said. She also highlighted a Métiers d'art flat bag completely covered in gold, copper, and black Strass crystals “which I think is really extraordinary.” “There's also a strong emphasis on novelty. We see novelty being a growing category in our leather goods, and in neutral colors, balanced with a few icon investments to provide options for every client,” said McCabe...."

Click: https://www.arizton.com/market-reports/north-america-jewelry-market Luxury Meets Responsibility: Sustainability Transforms the Jewelry Landscape Sustainability is rapidly becoming a central focus in the global jewelry industry, as consumers demand greater environmental and ethical accountability. Shoppers now prioritize materials like recycled metals, lab-grown diamonds, and ethically sourced gemstones, while also valuing circular design, favoring products that are repairable, recyclable, or upcycled. Leading brands are responding. In 2023, Tiffany & Co. expanded its sustainability initiatives by aligning with LVMH's Code of Conduct, adopting renewable energy, and launching eco-conscious efforts like Love for Our Oceans. Meanwhile, Prada's 2022 Eternal Gold collection introduced high jewelry made entirely from 100% recycled gold. As consumer expectations evolve, sustainability is becoming a key factor in product innovation and brand loyalty across the luxury jewelry market. Recent Market Activities in the North America Jewelry Sector Hey Harper Launches 'ICONS' in the UK (2023): Portugal-based luxury jeweler Hey Harper introduced its new capsule collection ICONS in the UK market. The line features bold pieces such as the GILDED THORNS Ear Cuff, PETALS SPIRAL Bracelet, CRYSTAL BLOOM Ring, and GARDEN OF LIGHT Brooch. Signet Strengthens Global Design and Supply Capabilities (2024): Signet continued to drive innovation by aligning with global design trends and launching new collections through strategic partnerships. AI-Driven Jewelry Market: Redefining Design, Operations, and Customer Experience at Scale The North American jewelry market is embracing a quiet revolution and it's powered by AI. From how designs are imagined to how customers shop, artificial intelligence is bringing speed, personalization, and a new layer of creativity to the industry. Designers are now using AI to create unique pieces tailored to customer preferences. These smart tools analyze trends, past purchases, and style data to generate designs that feel both fresh and personal. In 2024, the NEW VERTU AI Ring launched as a standout example, blending luxury design with smart features like heart rate and sleep tracking. AI is also helping brands move faster. In 2023, Pandora teamed up with o9 Solutions to bring AI into its planning process making it easier to predict demand, manage inventory, and respond to what customers want in real time. Personalization is another key frontier. AI-powered customization tools allow consumers to co-create pieces based on individual taste, budget, and style making the jewelry buying journey more interactive, efficient, and emotionally resonant. Consumer Preferences: A Shift Toward Experience, Personalization, and Purpose Experience over ownership: Millennials and Gen Z favor meaningful brand interactions, such as exclusive events and storytelling. Customization matters: Consumers seek personalized options like engraving to reflect individuality. Digital-first journey: Virtual try-ons and AR tools are now standard expectations. Sustainability-focused: Ethical sourcing and transparent practices are essential. Heritage appeal: Premium buyers still value rare metals and artisanal design.

mov_938934D3DC646AFCBCD354E2E246EC91,2025-07-11 06:00:00,en,WEB,"  Healthy, glowing skin straight from your bathroom Last year, we renovated our house. It cost a fortune. So holidays abroad were well and truly put on hold. As a result, I have become a dab hand at faking that gorgeous glow that you really only get after a week or two on holiday. I'm talking unrivalled radiance, sun-kissed cheeks and golden limbs that make every outfit look better. As a beauty editor, I've made it my mission over the past year to find the products that warm up the skin to make me look (and feel) healthier quickly. From tinted SPFs and bronzers, to instant tans and illuminating primers, trust me when I say I have done the legwork to find out which products apply well, look most natural and crucially, make me look radiant and tanned. Because, call me fickle, that's all I really ever want. Here I break down the different steps of my ultimate instant glow routine, which I swear by... My love of self-tan started with tanning drops. As a naturally fair 'English rose', I had always been incredibly nervous of fake tan and the inevitable mishaps that come with it. However, when I was introduced to the Isle Of Paradise Self Tanning Drops, I liked that they gave me the sense of control. It wasn't long before these little drops of sunshine became a firm fixture in my everyday skincare routine. I believe the recommendation is to use them every other day, but a few drops in my moisturiser every morning means that my skin always has a lovely, glowy canvas to apply the rest of my products. The Caudalie Self-Tan Sun Drops have become another favourite. To avoid any obvious tell-tale signs around my hairline, I use a big kabuki brush to buff my moisturiser and tanning drops in, which allows for a more natural finish. Isle of Paradise elf Tanning Face Drops in Medium Self-Tan Sun Drops Once I've applied my moisturiser, laced with tanning drops, I go in with my SPF. I've always loved a product that does more, and a base product with added sun protection is right up my street. Heliocare's 360 Colour Water Gel Bronze SPF50+ gives my skin just the right amount of coverage, evens out any irregular tone in an instant and blends in beautifully. The texture is similar to a lightweight foundation, so once I've applied it with my hands, I often buff it in with a foundation brush in areas that need thinning out slightly, like around my nose. Despite its name, it warms, rather than bronzes, the skin. And it does so beautifully. The viral Beauty of Joseon Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen is another knockout product, with 12 shades to choose from. 360 Colour Water Gel Bronze SPF50+ Beauty of Joseon Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen SPF30 PA+++ Every time I wear the L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion, I receive a compliment. Not only does it add a touch of colour to the skin, but it's the pearlescent sheen that it leaves behind that really makes a difference. You can use it as a primer, as I like to, tapped in as a highlighter or mixed in with your foundation for a more subtle finish. Vieve's iconic Skin Nova Instant Radiance Primer works similarly, but without the bronzing effect. Both transform tired skin in an instant. L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion Skin Nova Instant Radiance Primer Bronzer is arguably the must-have product in any glowing skin routine. Everybody has a preferred texture; mine will always be cream. I have dry and often dehydrated skin, so I prefer cream and liquid textures that won't settle in dry patches or fine lines. I couldn't write about tanned-looking skin without including Chanel's mega (in size and results) Les Beiges Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream. Not only does it give a natural-looking effect (which is down to its velvet matte finish), but it lasts and lasts, so is worth the investment. Earlier this year, the shade range grew, meaning it finally works for all skin tones. I can't ignore the fact that this giant bronzer does not travel well, so when I'm away from home or on the go, I use the Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Truffle. This twist-up cream bronzer has a slightly dewier finish compared to Chanel's, but the pigment payoff is great, and stick formulations make for easy application. Les Beiges Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Truffle In the middle of last summer, blonzing (a technique that blends bronzer and blusher together) became a viral make-up trend...."

Click: Luxury Meets Responsibility: Sustainability Transforms the Jewelry Landscape Sustainability is rapidly becoming a central focus in the global jewelry industry, as consumers demand greater environmental and ethical accountability. Shoppers now prioritize materials like recycled metals, lab-grown diamonds, and ethically sourced gemstones, while also valuing circular design, favoring products that are repairable, recyclable, or upcycled. Leading brands are responding. In 2023, Tiffany & Co. expanded its sustainability initiatives by aligning with LVMH's Code of Conduct, adopting renewable energy, and launching eco-conscious efforts like Love for Our Oceans. Meanwhile, Prada's 2022 Eternal Gold collection introduced high jewelry made entirely from 100% recycled gold. As consumer expectations evolve, sustainability is becoming a key factor in product innovation and brand loyalty across the luxury jewelry market.

mov_6CFA36314E65E1A6A31CB7B2C72A77A0,2025-07-11 07:13:57,en,WEB,"  Milan, July 2025 – Rene Caovilla, the Venetian luxury shoemaker revered for its exquisite craftsmanship and storied couture collaborations, returns to the Parisian spotlight this haute couture week with the unveiling of The Jungle Couture—a made-to-order collection that celebrates the brand's deep roots in fashion history while embracing a wilder, expressive vision of femininity. Long known for crafting showstopping footwear for couture houses such as Valentino, Chanel, and Dior—each partnership spanning decades of creative alliance—Rene Caovilla now takes centre stage with a collection that unites two contrasting forces: the discipline of couture and the instinctual beauty of the natural world. The result is a provocative, intensely detailed collection that vibrates with fuchsia hues and animalistic intensity. Among the five standout designs, two creations are nothing short of artistic feats. The first, a sheer tulle boot embroidered with more than 1,400 delicate flowers and butterflies, required approximately 120 hours of meticulous handwork. The second—a 105mm heeled ankle boot—features over 8,000 glistening crystals set into fuchsia tulle, an audacious play on transparency and sparkle that evokes both delicacy and daring. Together, they represent the apogee of the Maison's technical virtuosity and daring creativity. Three additional silhouettes—offered exclusively by order either in-store or through Rene Caovilla's digital platforms—complete the collection. The Jungle pump and slingback emerge in vivid fuchsia satin and tulle, each accented with over 150 crystals in intricate, jungle-inspired motifs. Meanwhile, the Jungle SuperCleo sandal, a couture evolution of one of Caovilla's most iconic styles, is reimagined with theatrical appliqués that evoke untamed flora and primal glamour. All styles in The Jungle Couture are handcrafted in Italy at the Rene Caovilla atelier, ensuring every detail reflects the Maison's unwavering dedication to artistry, elegance, and precision. This collection isn't just footwear—it is couture made wearable, a poetic clash between modern opulence and raw wilderness. Available only during Paris Haute Couture Week, The Jungle Couture will be presented exclusively at the Rene Caovilla boutique in Paris. Each piece is a testament to the Maison's past and a bold gesture toward a more audacious future in luxury design. Rene Caovilla's return to the couture calendar with The Jungle Couture signals more than just a seasonal collection—it marks a reaffirmation of the brand's ability to channel historical elegance into futuristic expression. By infusing the precision of haute couture with untamed motifs and materials, Caovilla bridges the gap between traditional artistry and boundary-pushing fashion. Each piece tells a story of duality: control and chaos, delicacy and power, tradition and rebellion. Fuchsia, the chosen colour palette of the collection, takes on symbolic resonance throughout. In the Maison's hands, it is no longer merely vibrant—it becomes a statement of bold femininity, wild allure, and seductive confidence. Whether adorning a delicately embroidered boot or accentuating the curves of the Jungle SuperCleo sandal, this vivid shade becomes the connective tissue that unifies the collection's vision, weaving together nature's unruliness with couture's formality."

1EB8AEEF1E1658D2D637ABBC1A04125B,2025-07-11 07:42:49,en,PRINT,"  At the Museum of Arts and Design at 2 Columbus Circle in New York in early June, Jonathan Adler, the potter and founder of the home furnishings company that bears his name, looked up at a blue and white ceramic apothecary jar he had designed in 2018. It had wavering stripes and the letters LSD on it. '' It's a nod to my love of Delft pottery and reimagined as if the potter was on an acid trip,'' Adler said, adding that he does not partake. Around him, an opening night party for the show he had assembled from the museum's extensive ceramics collection and his own work raged and raved. Adler, 58, moved among family, friends and vitrines spotlighting notable ceramic art works that had inspired him since he was a pottery-obsessed ''nerd'' growing up in New Jersey. He often took the train to the institution then known as the American Craft Museum and located on East 53rd Street. Many of the 300 or so objects on display -- divided into categories including animals, erotica, optimism, metallica and more -- offered a provocative lesson about humor and irreverence in the history of ceramics. In a section about Americana, Adler's grenade vases and rocket decanters (inspired by euphemisms for inebriated like ''bombed,'' ''blasted'' and ''tanked'') sat in dialogue with Howard Kotler's American Supperware from the late 60s. Kotler's plates depict flags and the White House in states of collapse. '' His work spanned so many different ideas and not only mixed materials but mixed art with commerce,'' Adler said. A section devoted to erotica took in Adler's porcelain breast-patterned vases and his suggestive banana versions, playing off Marvin Lipofsky's glass lips from 1967. In a section concentrating on animals, Adler admired a 1994 cast bronze ''Monkey Chair'' with primate faces and bodies as arms, and swirling tails as the back. '' Judy Kensley McKie finds ways to toy with animal forms in an idiosyncratic and fantastic style,'' he said of the Boston-based sculptural furniture maker who is now in her 80s. As he breezed past works from the museum's collection, he admired them like old friends. '' Ruth Duckworth's work removes the noise of decoration to expose pure form,'' he said of her white cups backed with square blades. The section inspired by the Funk Ceramics movement that came out of San Francisco in the late 1960s (it included Robert Arneson, Viola Frey, Peter Voulkos and others) consisted almost entirely of jokes and gags. Adler's needlepoints of ''Shrooms,'' his shoe-sized acrylic pills and a gilded ceramic lollipop holder vied for laughs with Arneson's earthenware ''Self-Portrait of the Artist Losing His Marbles'' (1965) and David Gilhooly's ''Bread Frog as a Coffee Break'' (1981), a kind of miniature glazed earthenware totem pole. ''Funk is one of my favorite genres because it was subversive and weird and crazy and silly,'' Adler had said earlier in a slide presentation about the show. '' One of the things funk people loved was making puns, and it kind of shows how on some level language can stimulate creativity and how there's a dialogue between language and objects.'' In fact, one of the first studios where he worked throwing pots, in Hell's Kitchen, was called Mud, Sweat & Tears. His stoneware ''Macho Macho Mugs'' made with faces of the Village People, is here for laughs, too, among walls that could almost be mistaken for a shop display, but with curatorial panels that analyze and comment. And yes, several Adler pieces are for sale in the museum shop -- nothing new in a post-Keith Haring world of crossed lines of art, design and commerce in museums. ''If Kehinde Wiley or Takashi Murakami has a show, they have merchandise for sale in the shops, and a show also promotes sales in their galleries,'' said Ezra Shales, a professor of craft and design history at the Massachusetts College of Art and Design, who teaches Adler to his students as an example of virtuosity in the way he makes humor look beautiful. '' Jonathan's work has historic references but without the weight,'' Shales explained. But joking aside, Adler's affection for the often overlooked medium runs deep. ''He's extremely knowledgeable about the history of ceramics, and has a lot to say about inspiration and technique,'' said Elissa Auther, the chief curator of the Museum of Arts and Design. She acknowledged that showing the work of a living designer has a commercial crossover but explained that she wanted to bring someone in to interpret the museum's collection alongside her own curatorial observations. Adler, she pointed out, knew how he wanted to display everything, and gave explicit directions to Simon Doonan, his husband and the creative director behind the cheeky window displays of the former Barneys New York. One corner of the show is a recreation of Adler's studio, with inspirational objects on shelves and clippings and quotes on the walls. '' Make Pots Not War,'' one reads. Adler's company, which was acquired this year by Consortium Brand Partners with plans to expand beyond his 10 locations in the United States and London, has annual sales of $150 million. Not bad for a Brown University undergraduate who took pottery classes down the hill at the Rhode Island School of Design (known as RISD) in the late 1980s and made, among other things, a Chanel teapot. ''But when I applied for their M.F.A. program in ceramics, they rejected me,'' he said. By 1992 the Museum of Arts and Design (operating then as the American Craft Museum) was selling one of his first striped ceramic vases, and in 1998, he opened his first store in SoHo. His career from there spun out (pun intended) to include the interior design of the Parker Palm Springs Hotel, serving as a judge on Bravo's ''Top Design'' and creating a life-size dream house in Malibu for Barbie's 50th anniversary. But even with all that, his potter's soul remains. He put it simply: ''I'm a grown man who gets to play with mud all day.'' A couple of days after the opening, Adler was in his studio on West Broadway in SoHo, which is behind a window in the back of his kaleidoscopic store full of chandeliers, sofas, pillows, and myriad midcentury-inflected objects that he has referred to as his ''prescription for antidepressive living.'' Two of his associates were muddy from sculpting the Foo Dog vases that Adler, who still tries out new ideas as maquettes in clay, had imagined. On the shelves all kinds of past design ideas thrown on a wheel and often fired in the kiln on site -- ashtrays, vases, busts and more -- had accumulated like so many spurned lovers. '' So many things I make fail,'' Adler sighed. '' The truth is that every idea I have is ridiculous and to try to make anything when there are so many things on the planet already is preposterous, I know that, but to do what I do you have to have a bubbling sense of possibility.'' He looked over a set of ashtrays he named for decidedly unglamorous towns. ''They're going to bomb,'' he said. '' But I challenge myself to not be too rational.''

mov_4BD23A217552B01B909CB75C4B2F1210,2025-07-11 07:50:02,fr,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[fr]Le groupe Rolex bénéficie d'allègements fiscaux pour la construction d'une nouvelle usine Tudor dans le Jura neuchâtelois, considéré comme structurellement faible. De quoi économiser des millions, mais Rolex garde le silence sur la somme exacte. S'il y a une région qui brille par sa renommée mondiale en matière de production horlogère, c'est bien l'Arc jurassien suisse. Entre Genève et Granges (SO), la région produit une grande partie des montres les plus prestigieuses, de Rolex à Omega en passant par Breitling et Breguet. La région semble donc l'endroit rêvé pour une nouvelle usine Rolex, destinée à fabriquer des mouvements pour sa marque filiale Tudor. En effet, dans l'Arc jurassien, les ouvriers spécialisés maîtrisent l'art de la mécanique de haute précision. Rien d'étonnant donc à ce que Tudor construise en 2022 un nouveau site de production au Locle (NE), en collaboration avec le fabricant de mouvements Kenissi, fondé par Tudor. Rolex garde le silence Cet investissement s'est transformé en success story: la technique des mouvements de manufacture Kenissi est considérée comme excellente et se retrouve dans les montres Breitling ou Chanel. Tudor, longtemps réduite à la filiale bon marché de Rolex, a aussi connu une forte croissance. Dans cette belle histoire, un détail semble être passé sous les radars de l'opinion publique. Le nouveau mouvement Tudor est subventionné par le contribuable, car lors de sa construction, Tudor et Kenissi ont reçu un cadeau fiscal, révèlent des documents du Secrétariat d'Etat à l'économie (Seco). Ni Berne ni Rolex n'ont accepté de révéler le montant des allègements fiscaux accordés, en raison du secret fiscal. Ce qui est sûr, c'est que la Confédération accorde un rabais fiscal maximal de 95'000 francs par emploi créé. En 2022, environ 300 personnes auraient travaillé dans les usines Tudor et Kenissi. Ainsi, selon une estimation très approximative, un allègement de 28,5 millions de francs pourrait avoir été accordé. Quoi de mieux que la Suisse? L'on estime que Rolex a réalisé un chiffre d'affaires de 10,1 milliards de francs en 2024 – bien plus que tous les autres horlogers suisses. L'entreprise garde le secret sur son bénéfice, mais il est clair que les affaires sont en plein essor, que Rolex a connu une forte croissance ces dernières années et que les délais d'attente pour certains modèles sont longs. Mais alors, pourquoi l'usine d'une filiale de Rolex aurait-elle besoin d'allègements fiscaux? Parce que contrairement aux groupes internationaux, une marque horlogère qui vit de la «Suissitude» est obligée de produire en Suisse. A cela s'ajoute le fait que pour 2020, le patron du groupe Swatch, Nick Hayek, avait supprimé la vente de ses très appréciés mouvements ETA à des marques tierces. Tudor était aussi concerné et a dû réagir. Nos questions sont restées sans réponse de la part de Rolex, qui a refusé tout commentaire. La Confédération affirme que «la rentabilité d'une entreprise n'est pas un critère» pour bénéficier d'allègements fiscaux. «Les allègements fiscaux donnent un argument pour la promotion de la place économique, en particulier pour les petits cantons, les cantons structurellement et financièrement plus faibles, ainsi que pour les régions périphériques.» Berne s'en lave les mains? En Suisse, environ 500 communes sont «structurellement faibles» et la Confédération accorde des allègements fiscaux lorsqu'une entreprise crée de nouveaux emplois ou maintient les emplois existants en les réorientant. Ainsi, depuis 2016, la Confédération a approuvé 40 allègements fiscaux, contribuant à la création de 1573 emplois et au maintien de 3824 emplois existants, nous écrit le Seco. Il s'agit d'investissements d'environ 2,8 milliards de francs, une somme importante pour les régions en question. Les économistes contestent l'utilité de ces allègements, mais en principe, ils «peuvent faire la différence dans des cas particuliers ciblés», selon le Seco. «C'est surtout le cas dans la concurrence internationale entre places économiques, car les Etats membres de l'UE proposent des instruments comparables.» Une étude du Seco a montré que dans les communes structurellement faibles bénéficiant d'allègements fiscaux, le nombre d'emplois industriels a moins diminué que dans d'autres communes. De son côté, Berne ne semble pas considérer les allègements fiscaux comme très importants, du moins au niveau fédéral. En effet, le Conseil fédéral veut supprimer ces incitations fiscales dans le cadre du paquet d'économies actuel."

On les croyait nés pour sauver la France de l'invasion migratoire, des barbecues halal et de la moustiquette woke, mais les voilà empêtrés jusqu'aux rotules dans une histoire d'usufruit, de notaire et de chiottes bouchées au manoir de Montretout. Car oui, Jean-Marie, le patriarche au rire de hyène et à la blague antisémite bien calée derrière la moustache, a tiré sa révérence en janvier dernier, en lâchant une ultime flatulence testamentaire qui pue encore dans tout Saint-Cloud. Dans son dernier souffle griffonné au Bic bleu sur un papier jauni par la haine et le pinard, il a décidé de baiser tout le monde une dernière fois en léguant l'usufruit de son manoir pourrave à Jany, sa dernière compagne – dite Jany la Douce, sauf quand elle cause pognon. Marine, qui comptait bien se faire un petit magot en vendant la bicoque moisie pour couvrir ses amendes européennes et ses frais d'avocat, s'est retrouvée avec un doigt bien profond dans la confiture. Fini les rêves de liquidité. Place aux huissiers, aux comptes bloqués, aux engueulades en costume Chanel. Jany ne lâche rien. Elle veut son million pour décamper. Et Marine, avec ses procès au cul, ses condamnations en série et ses relents de scandale, serre les fesses. Même la frangine Yann est de la partie, prête à troquer un pot de chambre contre une part de lingot. Quant à l'aînée, Marie-Caroline, celle-là a été rayée du testament comme une faute de frappe, punie d'avoir quitté le nid pour fonder sa petite secte familiale ailleurs. Mais attendez, c'est pas fini. Car cette saga, c'est pas juste des querelles de bourgeoises fâchées autour d'un buffet en acajou. C'est aussi du pognon planqué, des comptes aux îles Vierges, des lingots d'or cachés dans les chaussettes du majordome, et un soupçon de Tracfin pour relever la sauce. Le fameux Gérald Gérin, larbin majuscule et porteur officiel de valises pleines de cash, a déjà goûté aux joies du tribunal pour avoir dissimulé deux millions d'euros en or qui brillait plus que le sourire crispé de Marine un soir d'élections perdues. Ajoutez à ça les petits arrangements immobiliers entre copains facho-péguistes – comme la vente en douce de la villa Bonbonnière à un milliardaire ultra-catho, tout droit sorti d'un roman de Zemmour sous acide – et vous avez une farce tragique digne d'un épisode de Plus belle la Haine. Et dans le fond, qu'est-ce qu'on voit ? Des gens qui, toute leur vie, ont craché sur les pauvres, dénoncé les assistés, hurlé contre les familles décomposées, et qui, au moment de la grande faucheuse, s'arrachent les rideaux, se mouchent dans les testaments, et comptent les biftons sous la table pendant que le cercueil refroidit. Ça chiale, ça magouille, ça promet l'enfer à mamie Jany si elle ne rend pas les clés, tout en tapant sur les migrants qui « profitent du système ». Marine voulait redonner de la grandeur à la France ? Qu'elle commence par faire le ménage dans sa porcherie familiale, où les héritiers de la nation se battent comme des clodos de Neuilly pour un trousseau de clefs et trois bracelets en toc. Ça s'insulte, ça négocie au lance-flammes, et pendant ce temps-là, Jean-Marie repose en paix dans son cercueil tapissé de non-dits fiscaux, en rigolant à moitié dans sa barbe qu'on a oubliée de déclarer au fisc. Mais bon. Chez les Le Pen, tout finit toujours au tribunal avec des effluves de vieille haine et d'héritage moisi. Allez, rideau. Et qu'on tire la chasse."
tw_sl_1ba841a165f6ba30cec23f1ad40123d5,2025-07-11 09:57:28,en,WEB,"  While the collection was destined for creative director Matthieu Blazy's debut, it was, for now, the work of his talented studio team. The presentation was a feast for the senses, with an abundance of textures; dramatic feathered shoulders and ragged fringe accents on tweed tunics embodied a playful but also somewhat overwhelming use of volume. The oversized silhouettes, while eye-catching, bordered on overpowering, making some garments feel suffocating rather than liberating in their aesthetic. The Paris Fashion Week for Fall 2025 brought with it the highly anticipated debut of Matthieu Blazy's haute couture collection, an event that positioned the spotlight squarely on Chanel's illustrious heritage. The in-house design team presented a visually stunning tribute to Gabrielle “Coco” Chanel's enchanting connection to the Scottish Highlands, weaving together elements of the natural landscape with high fashion. Attendees were treated to a remarkable array of fashion, featuring ethereal ivory tweeds, rugged walking boots, and exquisitely embroidered tulle capes that bore an enchanting resemblance to shearling and swansdown — creating a harmonious blend of texture and technique that whispered sophistication. Everyone, Breath In To Smell Some Coffee RN, Express Your Gratitude to Robert Wun. Set against the serene backdrop of a softly lit ivory salon above the Grand Palais, the presentation felt almost otherworldly. The atmosphere was beautifully curated, evoking memories of past Chanel shows: plush quilted cushions adorned with intricate details, reflecting mirrored walls, and the lingering echoes of the rich history associated with Rue Cambon. It was more than a runway; it transformed into a sacred space designed for couture's most discerning clientele, enveloping them in an intimate ambiance. Despite the breathtaking craftsmanship displayed in each piece, there lingered a sense of something critical being absent — a singular, bold vision powerful enough to ignite a fashion revolution. Nevertheless, what the collection delivered was quintessentially Chanel: elegance interwoven with intimacy, leaving a tantalizing hint of something grand waiting just beyond the horizon. Paris Haute Couture Week 2025; Iris Van Herpen Stitches Living Algae Into the World of Fashion. Transporting the audience back to the very origins of Chanel haute couture at 31 rue Cambon, the Fall-Winter 2025/26 collection not only celebrated nature but also brought forth an autumnal palette that gracefully danced between rich greens, deep plums, and soft ecrus. The fabrics showcased a stunning reinterpretation of bouclé and tweed, either painted or embroidered, that underlined the innovative spirit of the fashion house while remaining rooted in its history. Noteworthy was the use of wheat ears, a symbol of abundance that held significant meaning for Gabrielle Chanel. They adorned garments in the form of dazzling buttons or intricate embroidery, showcasing the exceptional skills of the Haute Couture ateliers. Ultimately, the Fall/Winter 2025 haute couture show heralded a much-awaited return to the fashion house's spiritual birthplace, both in a literal and metaphorical sense. Nature served not only as a muse but also as a central theme, reflecting the creative studio's vision that drew deep inspiration from the Scottish Highlands and English countryside — the very landscapes that once mesmerized Chanel and influenced some of the house's most beloved codes, including the ubiquitous use of tweed. On the runway, the reinvention of tweed was nothing short of transformative. Pieces resonated with the essence of knitwear, as seen in a luxurious plum mohair suit, while a snowy white coat dress featured exquisite braiding that elevated its sophistication. Further illustrating this genius craftsmanship, tweed was cleverly manipulated to mimic the softness of sheepskin, artfully paired with feathers for a trompe l'oeil effect, showcased across an array of short jackets, gilets, and flowing long coats. Each design echoed Chanel's timeless elegance while hinting at a new chapter waiting to unfold in its storied legacy. (The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Jul 11, 2025 03:26 PM IST.

n2j65j2,2025-07-11 11:39:09,en,REDDIT,"  Regarding Europe's downfall. More often than not , a frog living in a well thinks it's the end of the world. Explore other countries mate you will realise. Let me give you some examples - 1. Healthcare - when was the last time a person with any injury had a surgery done without a wait period of 6 months? You guys literally leave people to die but not treat them. When was the last time you were able to get a paracetamol for a heavy fever waiting days for a doctors appointment and a prescription? Drugs are easier to find in EUROPE than life saving medicines One of my friend had an ACL tear skiing and wanted to get an MRI done and the wait time was what like 6 months in the UK. 2. Technology - 95% big tech companies are either from US or China. I guess you will not want to talk about this. 3. Manufacturing - When was the last time you heard that the semiconductors in your phone are made in europe? Or ships are built in europe? Or clothes are made in Europe. All you get is fooled by Louis Vuitton , Chanel and Prada to pay high prices for cheap bags made in China. Well I guess you would have seen those tiktoks. If you haven't, it would not be a surprise. China alone accounts for 30% of entire world's manufacturing of all products. Asia combined 60%. 4. Economy - peanut sized economies with no growth rate think their country does not have a downfall. Wake up mate. The highest GDP country in Europe - Germany's economy is not even the size of one province in China out 23. 5. Immigrant issue - Do the world a favour and take all of them. Europe will have more radical islamists terrorists than middle east + pakistan + Afghanistan combined. Your politicians are going to destroy you. You will find out in the next 20 years. I can go on and on but can't deal with your superiority complex. And when it comes to my inferiority. Brother come and visit China once and you will realize who is inferior 😂. Wake up brother and MEGA - Make Europe Great Again. I am not sure anymore how to explain the advantages of UPI over NFC. So here is the list - 1. No Specialized Hardware Required: UPI transactions can be performed using any smartphone with a camera and internet access, relying on QR codes or UPI IDs. In contrast, NFC payments require both the customer's phone and the merchant's terminal to have NFC capability. This is not common in countryside and leads to higher upfront costs. 2. Wider Accessibility: UPI works on basic smartphones and even feature phones via USSD, making it accessible to a much broader population. NFC payments are limited to users with NFC-enabled devices. Many samsung phones dont even support NFC. 3. Lower Cost for Merchants: Merchants only need to display a printed QR code for UPI, avoiding the cost of purchasing and maintaining NFC-enabled POS terminals. This makes UPI viable even for small vendors. 4. Direct Bank Account Integration: UPI payments are made directly from bank accounts, supporting both peer-to-peer and merchant payments...."

68ec5fd96ef614deb4aeb50ed8517891,2025-07-11 12:08:00,lt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[lt]Kodėl prabanga mus traukia, bet tuo pačiu ir erzina? Ką reiškia gyventi pasaulyje, kuriame turtas demonstruojamas kaip kultūros rėmimas? Prabangos ir moralės santykis – įdomi diskusijų tema. Nors kai kurie prabangą mato kaip ekonomikos variklį ar asmeninių vertybių atspindį, jos moralinės pasekmės priklauso nuo kiekvieno požiūrio, visuomenės vertybių ir konkretaus konteksto. Puikus pavyzdys – „Amazon“ įkūrėjo Jeffo Bezoso vestuvės Venecijoje, kurios sukėlė ir entuziazmą, ir pasipriešinimą. Kas mums nepatinka prabangoje? Visų pirma – jos nemoralumas. Žinomi mąstytojai, tokie kaip Platonas, Seneka ir Tertulianas kritikavo, kad žmonės, mylėdami turtą ir prabangą, supainioja tikrąsias vertybes. Mylėti prabangą reiškia mylėti galią, nuosavybę ir išvaizdą – visa tai, ką išmintingieji dažnai niekina. Prabangos gynimas ir etiškumo paieškos Nepaisant to, kad prabanga visais laikais sulaukia kritikos, šiandien matome, kaip turtingi žmonės stato privačius muziejus ir gausiai finansuoja parodas. Taigi, prabanga sėkmingai klesti šiuolaikinėje ekonomikoje ir naudinga didelei daliai gyventojų. Pavyzdžiui, J. Bezoso vestuvės Venecijoje, be pramogų ir poilsio, turėjo ir labdaringą aspektą, kuris prisidėjo prie miesto gerovės. Pasak organizatorių, dalis renginio metu surinktų lėšų bus skirta kultūros objektų, konkrečiai amfiteatro soduose, restauravimui. Tai pristatoma kaip „verslininko investicija į kultūros paveldą“, parodanti ne tik asmeninės šventės, bet ir kultūrinės mecenatystės svarbą. Taigi, be tiesioginės ekonominės naudos miestui, vestuvės taip pat prisidėjo prie istorinio paveldo išsaugojimo, suteikdamos joms platesnę, bendruomeninę vertę. Kiti prabangos industrijos etiškų iniciatyvų pavyzdžiai „LVMH“ (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy), kuriai priklauso tokie prekiniai ženklai kaip „Louis Vuitton“, „Dior“, „Tiffany & Co.“ ir daugelis kitų, yra vienas didžiausių kultūros mecenatų pasaulyje. Po tragiško Paryžiaus Dievo Motinos katedros gaisro, „LVMH“ ir Arnault šeima skyrė 200 milijonų eurų jos restauravimui. Jie taip pat remia įvairias parodas, muziejus, meno edukacijos programas jaunimui ir prisideda prie istorinio paveldo išsaugojimo visame pasaulyje. Pavyzdžiui, „Fondation Louis Vuitton“ muziejus Paryžiuje yra nuolatinė grupės filantropijos iniciatyva, skirta menui ir kultūrai populiarinti. „Chanel“ yra žinoma dėl savo įsipareigojimo Paryžiaus kultūrai ir menams. Prekinis ženklas skyrė 25 milijonus eurų „Grand Palais“ restauravimu. Be to, „Chanel“ remia „Palais Galliera“ (Paryžiaus mados muziejų) ir „Le19M“ – centrą, kuriame puoselėjami ir saugomi prancūzų meistriškumo amatai. „Fendi“ (priklausantis LVMH) yra stipriai susijęs su Romos paveldu. Jie skyrė 2,2 milijono eurų Trevi fontano restauravimui, o vėliau investavo ir į kitų Romos paminklų, tokių kaip Veneros ir Romos šventykla, atkūrimą. Jų pastangos tęsiasi su Villa d'Este Grotto of Diana atstatymu, pabrėžiant įsipareigojimą Italijos kultūros lobiams. „Bulgari“ taip pat aktyviai prisideda prie Romos paveldo išsaugojimo. Jie skyrė 1,5 milijono eurų Ispanijos laiptų atnaujinimui. „Kering“ grupė (kuriai priklauso „Gucci“, „Saint Laurent“, „Bottega Veneta“ ir kt.) per savo „Kering fondą“ aktyviai kovoja su smurtu prieš moteris ir vaikus, teikdama pagalbą aukoms, vykdydama prevencijos programas ir siekdama visuomenės mobilizacijos. Jie taip pat daug dėmesio skiria tvarumui ir socialinei lygybei. „Richemont grupė“ (valdanti „Cartier“, „Montblanc“, „Van Cleef & Arpels“ ir kt.) per „Cartier Philanthropy fondą“ gerina pažeidžiamų bendruomenių gyvenimą visame pasaulyje, remdami iniciatyvas, kurios suteikia prieigą prie pagrindinių paslaugų, skatina moterų ekonominę plėtrą ir teikia humanitarinę pagalbą. Prabangos ateities perspektyva: ką kalba futuristai? Prabanga visada asocijavosi su statusu ir išskirtinumu. Tačiau ateityje šis apibrėžimas gali keistis. Tikėtina, kad prabanga bus mažiau susijusi su garsių prekės ženklų logotipais, o daugiau su skaidrumu, sąžiningumu ir rūpesčiu aplinka. Tikra prabanga reikš ne tik patį daiktą, bet ir visą jo istoriją: žinojimą, kas pagamino jūsų rankinę, kurios siūlės kruopščiai įsiūtos amatininko rankomis, ir ar jam už tai buvo sąžiningai sumokėta. Vartotojai vis labiau domėsis, ar gaminant prekę buvo laikomasi tvarių praktikų, ar nebuvo išnaudojama gamta ir žmonės. Šis pokytis atspindi augantį visuomenės sąmoningumą ir siekį, kad prabanga atspindėtų ne tik materialinę vertę, bet ir etines bei moralines nuostatas. Turėti mažiau, bet ilgaamžių ir etiškai pagamintų prabangos prekių taps prestižiškiau, nei kaupti spintas, pilnas trumpalaikių mados tendencijų. Taip pat išaugs individualizuotų, pagal užsakymą gaminamų prabangos prekių paklausa, kas sumažins atliekų kiekį ir sustiprins asmeninį ryšį su daiktu. Tvarios mados ateitis Neseniai atliktas tyrimas „Tvarios mados ateitis“ (angl. „The Future of Sustainable Fashion“) nagrinėjo, kaip Europa iki 2040 m. galėtų pereiti prie etiškos mados. Tyrimas išskyrė kelis galimus ateities scenarijus. Vienas iš viltingų scenarijų – pasaulis, kuriame mados sistema yra visiškai skaidri. Tokiu atveju vartotojai žinotų visą informaciją apie savo drabužius – nuo jų kilmės iki gamybos proceso ir jame dalyvavusių žmonių. Prekių ženklai būtų teisiškai įpareigoti gerbti darbuotojų teises ir aplinką, o skaitmeninės priemonės stebėtų visą drabužio gyvavimo ciklą.

Credit: Getty Though Princess Diana wore Chanel tweed suits earlier in her royal life, in her later years—and especially after her 1996 divorce—she found it difficult to wear Chanel for the most heartbreaking reason. The brand's interlocked Cs iconic logo reminded her too much of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles—whose affair dominated much of Diana's 15-year marriage to Charles. As Diana herself said in a 1995 interview, there were three people in her marriage, so it was a bit crowded. In the final years of her life, Princess Diana was a fan of many designer labels—think Versace and Dior, for starters—but one fashion house she avoided? Chanel—and for the most heartbreaking reason. It's not because she wasn't a fan of their clothes—it boiled down to her husband Prince Charles's longstanding affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, an affair that had plagued much of their marriage. Chanel, of course, is known for its interlocking Cs—and this reminded the Princess of Wales too much of Charles and Camilla. Because of Chanel's iconic logo, Diana “could no longer bring herself” to wear the brand, People reported. Princess Diana wearing Chanel earlier in her royal life. Getty After marrying in 1981, Charles and Diana separated in 1992 and finalized their divorce in 1996—just one year before her untimely death. Though she had worn Chanel tweed suits early in her royal life, after her divorce, Diana couldn't wear Chanel because, as Australian designer Jayson Brundson told Harper's Bazaar, “She said, 'No, I can't wear linked Cs, the double C.” Brundson styled Diana for a hospital charity event during what would ultimately become her last visit Down Under in 1996. After choosing a pair of Chanel shoes to compliment her cream Versace skirt suit, Diana demurred at wearing them. “I asked why, and she said, 'It's Camilla and Charles,'” Brundson recalled. Princess Diana in Sydney, Australia on November 1, 1996. Getty Princess Diana in Versace on October 31, 1996 in Sydney, Australia. Getty “It was definitely the timing, it being post-divorce,” he continued. “She would have seen linked Cs, and they would have just reminded her of Charles and Camilla. The shoes were quite boldly Chanel—I think they had gold linked Cs on them. And I think for photo optics, people would have honed in on that considering it was so fresh after the divorce, as well.” Adding insult to injury, during her marriage to Charles, Diana found a pair of cufflinks Charles owned engraved with interlocked Cs—which she interpreted as an homage to Charles and Camilla. “It's hard to believe that anyone as intelligent and well-read as the Prince of Wales could be so stupid—so utterly incapable of imagining what a new wife might conclude if her husband carried a photograph of his old girlfriend in his diary,” royal biographer Penny Junor wrote in her biography of Camilla called The Duchess: The Untold Story. Princess Diana in Chanel earlier in her royal life. Getty Speaking to Andrew Morton for his bombshell 1992 biography about her called Diana: Her True Story, Diana recalled Charles sending Camilla flowers with a signed card reading “To Gladys from Fred”—their nicknames for one another. “[I met her] very early on,” Diana said of Camilla (via People). “I was introduced to the circle, but obviously I was a threat. I was a very young girl, but I was a threat. We always had discussions about Camilla, though. I once heard him on the telephone in his bath on his handheld set saying, 'Whatever happens, I will always love you.' I told him afterwards that I had listened at the door, and we had a filthy row.” About two weeks before their wedding on July 29, 1981, someone in Charles's office told Diana that he had a bracelet made for Camilla with “G” and “F” (for Gladys and Fred) intertwined on it. “I was devastated,” Diana said.

So we made light of it.” Diana added that, on their honeymoon, she noticed cufflinks on her husband's wrists—“Two Cs entwined like the Chanel Cs,” she said. “Got it in one; knew exactly.

It joyfully recycles (Glenn Martens for Maison Margiela, Germanier) and places respect for nature (Ronald van der Kemp and Iris van Herpen) at the heart of an innovative creative process. The first thing to note is the list of notable absentees, largely due to the game of musical chairs played by the major fashion houses. Jonathan Anderson (Dior) reserved his first haute couture collection for January 2026. Duran Lantink (Jean Paul Gaultier) will show in September 2026, marking the end of the guest designer model and the return to ready-to-wear collections. Pierpaolo Piccioli (Valentino) and Matthieu Blazy (Chanel, who nevertheless presented a collection) were also absent. French houses like Alexis Mabille and Julien Fournié were also missing. Balenciaga: Gvasalia being Gvasalia before his departure for Gucci Balenciaga Couture 2025 Credits: ©Launchmetrics/spotlight The highlights remain, starting with Gvasalia's last show for Balenciaga, held in the intimate setting of the house's historic salons (Avenue George V, Paris 8ᵉ). Intimate, in a manner of speaking, as the crowd amassed at the entrance to see the cohort of stars invited to the front row (Aya Nakamura, Katy Perry, Nicole Kidman, Lauren Sánchez Bezos, Cardi B, etc.) or to walk the runway (Kim Kardashian, Isabelle Huppert, Naomi Campbell). Contrasting with this ""look at me, I'm famous"" aspect, the show's soundtrack listed the first names of the collaborators, ending with Demna and followed by the song ""No Ordinary Love"" by Sade. This reflected the ""no ordinary"" fashion that Gvasalia offers. In this instance, it was a ""best of"" of his signature style (which could also be found in the exhibition dedicated to him): women's suits with oversized shoulders and structured couture dresses, oversized men's jackets, and a tribute to the nightdress worn by Elizabeth Taylor in the film ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" for Kim K. Kim Kardashian for Balenciaga Couture 2025 Credits: ©Launchmetrics/spotlight The only nod to his predilection for streetwear, absent from the show, was an unprecedented act. Gvasalia took a turn around the catwalk dressed in a black hoodie, oversized military print trousers, and a baseball cap (worn under the hoodie, for style). Backstage, he reportedly said: ""Dressed in a hoodie and jeans, with a baseball cap, I feel like I'm coming out"" (source The Cut). This was a clever way of suggesting that everything will change when he becomes creative director at Gucci, whose first show is announced for March 2026. Maison Margiela and Germanier: the future of fashion will embrace the joy of recycling, or not at all To embody this link between couture and street culture, one had to look to Glenn Martens' first collection for ""Artisanal"", the name given to the house's couture collections. To pay tribute to Martin Margiela, the creator of the eponymous brand, the new creative director held the show in the basement of the Centquatre (Paris 19ᵉ), the last place where Margiela had shown. Maison Margiela FW25 Credits: Maison Margiela Building on the house's DNA (recovery, upcycling, anonymity, the repurposing of objects), Martens favoured a decor of torn wallpapered walls. He covered the models' faces with masks made from crushed metal boxes, varnished paper, and illusion tulle (an openwork fabric fashioned from a network of regular meshes of fine polyester threads). He created looks made from crumpled plastic bags and an impressive gold dress made from recycled computer wires and cables. Look 10: Dress with a heart-shaped draped skirt in gold fabric woven with metallic threads. Credits: Maison Margiela Along the way, Martens showed that couture is the ideal way to adapt to a new and necessary way of making fashion, both ecologically and ethically. The future of fashion lies in the ability of houses to adapt to what natural resources remain. It will involve recycling, or not at all, to paraphrase Malraux. In this, couture plays a key role, especially as it is part of an artisanal, experimental, and artistic approach. Recycling is precisely the strong point of Swiss designer Kevin Germanier, who told FashionUnited: ""The day my couture is not made from recycled elements, it will no longer be worth attending my shows."" He added in the press release, about his collection ""Les Joueuses"": ""We are living in a heavy time, politically, socially, and economically. My role is to bring light, and that's what drives my work. This collection is a direct response to that. I wanted joy on the catwalk."" This is to contrast with a certain lack of enthusiasm for sewing scraps. Germanier Autumn/Winter 2025/2026 Haute Couture Credits: Germanier With silhouettes in upcycled leather previously used for Eurovision 2025, a signature technique of weaving recovered beads, a final dress designed from recycled Japanese paper, and feathers from past creations, the message is aligned right down to the decor. The decor was made of plastic balloons, ""rejected for sewing defects, but which will be used for my next show,"" Germanier explained to FashionUnited. Germanier Autumn/Winter 2025/2026 Haute Couture Credits: Germanier Ronald van der Kemp and Iris van Herpen: when couture makes nature, recycled or living, a creative material Another key player in change is Dutchman Ronald van der Kemp, who only upcycles offcuts and recovered luxury fabrics. For his AW26 couture collection, ""Call of the Wild"", he went even further by creating an ode to nature, particularly the Amazon rainforest, and by exploring biomimicry. ""We don't realise how many solutions we have,"" said expert Alain Renaudin at Paris Good Fashion. RDVK Ronald van der Kemp Autumn/Winter 2025/2026 Haute Couture Credits: ©Launchmetrics/spotlight This reconnection with nature definitely comes to us from the Netherlands with another renowned designer: Iris van Herpen. She highlighted the relationship between humans and the sea, underlining the fragility of this vital ecosystem via a multi-sensory sound/light/scent ambiance (in partnership with perfumer Francis Kurkdjian). Van Herpen used textile fibres created in the laboratory by microbial fermentation from plant-based, biodegradable, innovative, and luxurious materials...."

He says so himself . LONDON (AP) — Morgan Riddle's effect on Wimbledon semifinalist Taylor Fritz's rise in the rankings has been significant. He says so himself. Riddle has been at the All England Club this year and others in her role as a fashion influencer, telling her hundreds of thousands of social media followers how tennis has become ""the chicest sport in the world.” She's been featured in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar and the New York Times' Style section. She was seated at Centre Court on Friday for her boyfriend Fritz's match against Carlos Alcaraz. Riddle frequently is at tournaments to cheer for him. They were featured in the Netflix tennis documentary “ Break Point.” Morgan Riddle went from Minnesota to New York and multiple internships Riddle, 27, is a Minnesota native who attended Wagner College in New York City. “By the end of my junior year, I had completed seven internships,” she said in a Wagner College video about the Class of 2019 member. Riddle explained that the internships included gigs at a magazine, a newspaper, a government office, a coffee company startup and a real estate company, with tasks including social media. Riddle and Fritz met about five years ago. Taylor Fritz credits Morgan Riddle's influence Fritz was the U.S. Open runner-up last September — his first appearance in a Grand Slam final — and reached a career-high ranking of No. 4 in November. He says it's important to have someone “push you in the right direction all the time, supporting you. "" He spoke about Riddle's role after his 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) victory over Karen Khachanov in the quarterfinals. “There's an obvious correlation between my results and ranking and the time we've been together,” he said. “I would have to say she's been a big help to me, just kind of keeping me focused, having someone who cares and just pushes you to just do better and do the right things, be healthier.” Morgan Riddle promotes fashion and explains 'tenniscore' Riddle has worked with the All England Club to create video segments called “Wimbledon Threads.” Wearing brands such as Chanel and Jimmy Choo, she details trends like “tenniscore.” “'Tenniscore' isn't just about pleated skirts and vintage polos. It's about aspirational minimalism with a competitive edge,” she said in a video last week entitled “ How Wimbledon made tennis chic.” She added that Wimbledon has “helped tennis become the chicest sport in the world.” Riddle isn't afraid to throw a few zingers. “Of course we're here for the tennis but what was once a strictly sporting event has also turned into a global fashion spectacle. I know some of you may not want to hear that but just because the fact annoys you, doesn't make it any less true,” she said. That segment has 12,300 views as of Friday — a different Wimbledon video featuring a kid asking Aryna Sabalenka about pancakes has more than double that. Riddle's clips on TikTok, where she has nearly 600,000 followers, are more popular. She also has more than 450,000 followers on Instagram. Fritz often takes photos of her to post on social media. “I've definitely gotten a lot better over the last couple of years but very reluctantly,” he said in an interview with The Associated Press last year. “It's very embarrassing in public when I'm taking pictures (and) people are looking at me taking pictures of her. But you got to do what you got to do sometimes. She also takes good pictures of me.” AP tennis: https://apnews.com/hub/tennis Ken Maguire, The Associated Press"

17890106361276134,2025-07-11 14:17:08,en,INSTAGRAM,"  Real talk about “relationships” in luxury retail… I've worked in this game for 20+ years. Started at Nordstrom as a stock boy. Worked my way up to top salesperson. Then came Bally, Chanel, and now I'm at the most luxurious French fashion house on the planet. So yeah, I know a thing or two about selling—and more importantly, about people. In luxury, everybody loves to throw around the word “relationship.” But let's be real… most folks don't even know what that means. A real relationship doesn't happen the first time you meet someone. It's not a “hi, nice to meet you” and boom—you're bonded for life. Nah. That's not how trust works. There are three things every real relationship needs—sales or not. 1. Know. You gotta actually know who you're dealing with. That means names, stories, families, personalities—not just what they want to buy. 2. Like. Do you actually like each other? Because chemistry matters. Don't fake it. Not everyone clicks—and that's okay. But don't be that person who throws others under the bus just because you didn't vibe. That's not maturity—that's projection. 3. Trust. This one? It's everything. Trust means giving grace. It means understanding that sometimes sh*t happens. Packages get delayed. Items sell out. Systems crash. Your salesperson isn't Amazon Prime—and they sure as hell don't control the warehouse. But when there's trust, there's patience. There's understanding. There's teamwork. And let me say this loud and clear. The service industry is full of people trying to make others happy. Not perfect. Not psychic. Not miracle workers. But human beings doing their best in a high-pressure space. If you've got a great relationship with your advisor—nurture it. Make time. Communicate. Be human. And if it's not working anymore, don't be toxic—just move on. Find someone you do connect with...."

The GRU location is the single malt Scotch whisky's second SIS in Latin America, following its debut in Panama in 2023, and expands its footprint in Latin America to the busiest and most important airport in the region. Situated alongside renowned brands such as Chanel, Dior and Lancome, the new São Paulo SIS positions The Macallan at the heart of the airport's curated luxury environment. “The opening of The Macallan Shop-in-Shop in São Paulo marks a significant milestone in our Latin American journey.

a14c3e09ddc0198198a469cbfa870b7b,2025-07-11 15:25:00,en,WEB,"  Legacy, Love & A Sparkling Yes — Will Peltz and Kenya Kinski-Jones Are Officially Engaged In a year full of breakups, breakdowns, and broken PR statements, here comes a love story that feels like a sigh of relief. Yes, this is what romance looks like in real life—if your real life just happens to come with red carpets, billion-dollar legacies, and more iconic last names than an awards ceremony guest list. HOLLYWOOD, CALIFORNIA – AUGUST 11: Kenya Kinski-Jones and Will Peltz attend Variety's 2022 Power of Young Hollywood celebration presented by Facebook Gaming on August 11, 2022 in Hollywood, California. (Photo by Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic) Will Peltz , 39, and Kenya Kinski-Jones , 32, are officially engaged—and the internet is glowing almost as much as that ring. The pair, who've been together for more than a decade , announced their engagement in a black-and-white Instagram post that immediately had celebrity friends (and fans) flooding the comments. In the photo, Kenya gently kisses Will on the cheek, her dazzling diamond on full display, while the caption reads simply: “JUST ENGAGED My whole heart for my whole life. ” Cue the collective awww. A Romance Rooted in Legacy For those just tuning in: this is no ordinary couple. Kenya is the youngest daughter of music legend Quincy Jones , who passed away in late 2024 at age 91, and acclaimed actress Nastassja Kinski . Her timeless beauty and effortless style have made her a quiet but powerful presence in the fashion world. She's walked for Stella McCartney, Calvin Klein, and Chanel, but she's also known for being fiercely private —which makes this public celebration of love all the more special. Will, on the other hand, is the son of billionaire businessman Nelson Peltz and former model Claudia Heffner Peltz —a family known for its high-profile connections and close-knit bond. His sister, Nicola Peltz Beckham , famously married Brooklyn Beckham , cementing the Peltzes' place in modern Hollywood royalty. Nicola wasted no time posting her excitement online, writing: “KENYA JONES PELTZ MY FOREVER SISTER!!!! IM SO HAPPY I LOVE YOU BOTH ” Talk about family goals. A Decade in the Making Kenya and Will's love story didn't begin in the headlines. They've been soft-launching their relationship long before it was a trend—sharing quiet anniversary posts, snapshots of beach days, and cozy behind-the-scenes moments. In April 2020, Kenya shared a rare and heartfelt tribute on their ninth anniversary: “9 years! … My heart and best friend, I more than love you and I always will. You felt like home since the first day.” Their story proves that even in the whirlwind of fame and family legacies, genuine connection still matters—and can last. A Star-Studded Seal of Approval Within hours of the announcement, the comments section of Kenya's post read like a red carpet guest list: Paris Jackson : “yes ” Sophia Stallone : “yay!! congratulations you two” Laura Harrier dropped heart emojis. Even a few fashion designers chimed in with custom engagement emojis (yes, that's a thing now). Meanwhile, Will also shared his own emotional tribute to Kenya's late father shortly after his passing, calling Quincy “a guiding light” and “a reminder that true greatness is measured not just by talent, but by love.” What's Next? While there's no word yet on a wedding date (or if it'll be held on the Beckham estate or somewhere more low-key), fans are already buzzing about the dress, the guest list, and—let's be honest—the possibility of a Vogue spread. But for now, it's enough to just celebrate the moment. A decade of love, a lifetime ahead, and a reminder that sometimes, the best love stories are the ones built slowly, quietly, and with intention. Here's to Will and Kenya—legacy kids, lovers, and now, fiancés. Tags · kenya jones·quincy jones"
mov_22A4B27EE296DB5F595DCAD2882AB951,2025-07-11 15:26:29,en,WEB,"  While a white shirt with a black bikini will always be a timeless beach combination, this year there has been a return to extravagant – possibly bordering on obnoxious? – resortwear. Instead of dressing as though they holiday like you and me, celebrities are embracing an opulent Euro aesthetic that cackles in the face of quiet luxury and puts the fun back into the vacation wardrobe. It was April when declared that the Pucci Woman would define the 2025 vibe: fast forward to this week, and Hailey Bieber was dressed like a human shot of limoncello in Port d'Andratx, wearing a zesty custom capri-pant-and-string-bikini set by the Italian brand, and a pair of kitten heels for good measure. If the quiet luxury movement was all about an Olsen twin-inspired, anti-paparazzi approach to dressing, this is the total opposite: think, leaning into look-at-me style tropes. Having a dedicated resortwear wardrobe is in itself an extravagance (a sign that you spend a chunk of the year out of office without a second thought for your annual leave allowance). Swirl print palazzos, tunics and pool-ready co-ords aren't ever going to translate into your everyday wardrobe. Unless, that is, you actually live in Portofino. Celebrities have levelled up their swimwear game specifically this year, via custom resortwear creations – like Hailey Bieber's Pucci set – and rare archive looks. Kylie Jenner, for example, has worn a rhinestone-encrusted Chanel bikini from the spring/summer 1995 collection a polka-dot set from Ralph Lauren's spring/summer 2000 collection. There's nothing frugal about this particular second-hand swimwear: both sets are considered collector's items. You can embrace Amalfi styling without blowing four figures on a bikini, however. Simply seek out bold colours, printed scarves and sarongs (if you can stretch to Pucci, then do so), and embellished swimwear. One note of caution: this look really requires a Med backdrop – your local lido won't cut it. Extra embellishment: For her recent holiday to Mallorca, Dua Lipa amped up the glamour in a sequin-encrusted kaftan and a cheery-embellished bikini from the recent Frankies Bikinis X Réalisation Par collaboration. She also boarded a yacht in a teeny-tiny leopard-print bikini with a gold Chanel quilted bag – the Euro vacay girl doesn't mess around with practical things like raffia. Frankies Bikinis X Réalisation Par Nick Triangle Bikini Top Frankies Bikinis X Réalisation Par Mackenzie Bikini Bottom Double or triple polka dots: In Italy, Kylie Jenner wore a polka-dot bikini and matching capri pants from Ralph Lauren's spring/summer 2000 collection. The Kardashian-Jenners have never really messed with shy-and-retiring minimalism, and she's been summering this year in leopard print, studded and spotty swimwear. It's all very vintage Dolce (sorry, Kourtney). Sir Devin Polka-Dot Bikini Top Dolce & Gabbana Cotton Pants With Polka-Dot Print Football fever: Model Paloma Elsesser took to the beach in Barcelona toting an oversized Balenciaga City bag (a fashion-girl pool bag) and wearing a vintage football print co-ord. She proves that summer can be a time for loud prints and a more literal take on Euros dressing (after all, it is the summer of women's football). Conner Ives Printed Shirred Jersey Top Conner Ives Appliquéd Lace-Trimmed Striped Shorts Pucci prints: For a Rhode party in Mallorca to celebrate the launch of her lemon-scented lip balm, Hailey dressed on-theme in a “lemontini” look that matched her cocktail. Her stylist Dani Michelle worked on this custom Pucci capri and bikini set, which features a zesty twist on the brand's iconic Iride print. For a boat trip, she then added a polka dot scarf to her hair to make the whole thing even more Euro summer. Pucci Iride Printed Swimsuit Pucci Iride Printed Silk Miniskirt La Dolce Vita scarves: Alexa Chung embraced the retro vibe of Positano in her bright red high-waisted shorts, which she styled with a clashing purple top and a printed scarf looped over her hair. It's nostalgic Italian glamour at its very best, and let's be honest, beats a plain black bikini any day. Pucci Marmo Silk Twill Scarf Cou Cou Intimates..."

Nan Ge steht als Content Creator kurz davor mit seinem Chanel den nächsten Meilenstein zu erreichen. Um diesen zu pushen braucht er eine gute Idee.

Leichter gesagt als getan, den ""Prinz Yumeta "" hat bisher jegliche Zusammenarbeit mit Männern abgelehnt. Doch Nan Ge schafft es ihn zu überzeugen.

Am Anfang steht die Zusammenarbeit der beiden, und welche vor und Nachteile auf Social Media hat im Fordergrund. Später dann die Frage wie gehen sie nun mit ihrer Beziehung in der Öffentlichkeit um. Was ich persönlich echt gut umgesetzt finde. Der Titel ist aber ja natürlich nicht umsonst ab 18! Die ein oder andere unzensierte Bettgeschichte gibt es natürlich auch 😉 Dabei sind die Protagonisten Sympathisch und und nachvollziehbar. Der Manhua ist im Gegensatz zu den meisten Manlin Titeln in schwarz-weiß. Für mich eine gelungene kurze BL Reihe zum Wohlfühlen. Habt ihr die Reihe schon gelesen?

mov_C252112DA9422709E8882DF2B24D536C,2025-07-11 17:29:42,en,WEB,"  After Demna Gvasalia's farewell show for Balenciaga, the Haute Couture Week opened new perspectives in Paris. The autumn/winter collections 2025/2026 showed a fashion that combines craft and technology. Upcycling was cheerfully celebrated by Glenn Martens for Maison Margiela and Germanier. Ronald van der Kemp and Iris van Herpen focused on respect for nature. Of course, the absences of well -known designers also noticed during this fashion week: inside, which was also caused by the chair in the large fashion houses. For example, Jonathan Anderson shows his first Haute-Couture collection for Dior in January 2026, after he already presented his first menswear collection this month. Duran Lantink starts Beijean Paul Gaultier with the Womenswear collection in September 2026. This marked the end of the guest designer model and the return to Prêt-à-porter collections. Pierpaolo Piccioli at Valentino as well as French houses such as Alexis Mabille and Julien Fournié were also missing. Chanel showed a collection, but not under the leadership of the new creative chief matthieu Blazy, who only made his debut in October during the Paris Fashion Week. The current collection was the last of the internal design studio. Balenciaga: Demna Gvasalia completely before moving to Gucci Balenciaga Couture 2025 Credits: © Launchmetrics/Spotlight Speaking of the last show. Demna Gvasalia's farewell to Balenciaga took place in the historical salons of the house on Avenue George V in Paris. The rush was great. Numerous stars like Aya Nakamura, Katy Perry, Nicole Kidman, Lauren Sánchez Bezos and Cardi B were in the front row. Kim Kardashian, Isabelle Huppert and Naomi Campbell ran over the catwalk himself. The show music announced the names of the employees: inside. In the end, the name was called, followed by Sades 'No Ordinary Love'. A reflection of his extraordinary fashion. The show presented its characteristic designs. These could also be seen in the exhibition dedicated to him: women's costumes with oversized shoulders, structured couture dresses, oversized men jackets and a tribute to Elizabeth Taylor's nightgown from the film 'The cat on the hot tin roof' for Kim Kardashian. Kim Kardashian for Balenciaga Couture 2025 Credits: © Launchmetrics/Spotlight However, there was a little reference to his streetwear preference that was missing in the show. Gvasalia showed itself in a black hoodie, an extra -wide trousers with a military print and a cap. According to 'The Cut', he said backstage: “In hoodie, jeans and baseball cap, I feel like it was out”. A clever hint that everything will change with his position as a designer at Gucci. Its first show has been announced for March 2026. Maison Margiela and Germanier: The future of fashion is upcycling Glenn Martens' first collection 'Artisanal', the name of the couture line of the house, embodied the connection between Couture and Street Culture. As a tribute to Martin Margiela, the founder of the brand of the same name, the new creative director presented his collection in the Centquatre in Paris. Martin Margiela had held his last show there. Maison Margiela HW25 Credits: Maison Margiela Martens picked up the DNA of the house: recycling, upcycling, anonymity and misuse of objects. He chose a decor of torn wallpapers. He covered the faces of the models with masks made of crushed metal cans, paint paper and illusion tulle. The looks were created from crumpled plastic bags. An impressive golden dress was made from recycled computer cables. Look 10: Dress with draped, heart -shaped skirt made of golden, fabric woven with metal threads. Credits: Maison Margiela Glenn Martens showed that Couture can pave the way to develop towards a new, more ecological and ethical fashion production. The future of fashion is the ability of the fashion houses to adapt to the remaining natural resources. The couture plays an important role in this because it is manual, experimentally and artistically oriented. Recycling is also the strength of the Swiss designer Kevin Germanier. He told fashionunited: “On the day my couture no longer consists of recycled materials, it is no longer worth visiting my shows”. The press release says about his collection 'Les Joueuses': “We live in a difficult time: political, socially, economical. My job is to bring light, and that drives my work. This collection is a direct answer. I wanted joy on the catwalk”...."

El emotivo dueto ocurrió mientras Belinda y el productor Luis Gerardo Méndez recibían una placa de platino por parte de Warner Music, que certifica 100 millones de reproducciones de la banda sonora de la exitosa producción de Prime Video.

Gran parte de este éxito se debe a la participación de Belinda, quien da vida a Daniela Levy de Mijares, un personaje lleno de matices que ha conquistado al público tanto por su actuación como por su talento vocal. La artista no solo impresionó con su interpretación de clásicos del pop mexicano, sino que cuidó cada detalle de su personaje, seleccionando personalmente un vestuario de firmas como Versace, Chanel y Hermès, que realzó la elegancia de cada escena. El momento más emotivo de la noche fue cuando, tras interpretar el icónico tema frente a su autora original, Amanda Miguel, la legendaria cantante no pudo contener las lágrimas y le dedicó palabras de admiración. “Cantas precioso, lo hiciste muy bien y apenas estás mostrando lo que verdaderamente puedes hacer”. Belinda, visiblemente emocionada, respondió: “Te amamos, te admiramos y eres la mejor”. La banda sonora de Mentiras ha reavivado el gusto por las baladas románticas de los 80. Solo “Él me mintió” sumó más de 1.8 millones de reproducciones en Spotify en una semana, con un aumento del 94% desde el estreno. Tras la proyección, ambas artistas celebraron este logro con una interpretación íntima que rápidamente se volvió viral, sellando uno de los momentos más memorables para los fans de la nostalgia pop y confirmando a Belinda como una de las figuras más queridas y versátiles del entretenimiento actual."

Rumors of her casting began after she was spotted filming a kissing scene with Paul Kelly, who's portraying John F. Kennedy Jr. in the show. Kennedy and Hannah met in the early 1980s when their families were both vacationing in Saint Martin. However, it wasn't until 1988 that they reconnected at a wedding. At some point after the wedding, they began dating. They were together on-and-off until they split in 1994. American Love Story will mostly focus on Kennedy's relationship with Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, whom he started dating (and eventually married) after his split from Hannah. However, it appears the show will also touch on at least one of his prior relationships, which is where Dree's character comes in. Scroll down to learn more about the actress who's joining Kelly and Sarah Pidgeon in the show. Is Dree Hemingway related to Ernest Hemingway?

Mariel is still acting today, although her roles are few and far between, as she spends a lot of her time advocating for mental health and wellness. What has Dree Hemingway starred in? Dree began her career as a model in 2009. She has walked in runway shows and modeled in campaigns for brands including Gucci, Valentino, Chanel, and more. She also appeared in Playboy in 2016.

Hundreds took him up on the offer. FULL TEXT July 9,2025, Wednesday         Online Correction: This article has been revised to reflect the following correction: An earlier version of this article described incorrectly Elias Medini's explanation of his dismissal from Interview magazine. Mr. Medini said that he had become ""a liability"" after a negative Dior review, not that the magazine did not want to damage its relationship with LVMH. CORRECTION APPENDED Denied a seat at Jonathan Anderson's Dior debut, a fashion critic invited all of Paris to watch it with him at a bar. Hundreds took him up on the offer. When attendees gathered last month at Les Invalides in Paris for Jonathan Anderson's debut show for Dior, the mood was solemn. The celebrities, editors and executives, gathered together in a complex of 17th-century buildings that honor France's military history, sat in quiet anticipation. Across town, a far more vocal crowd of students, writers and tourists packed into a bar and sipped beer, cracked jokes and erupted into cheers or groans as each of Mr. Anderson's looks was revealed. The second crowd was at a watch party thrown by Elias Medini, 26, a fashion commentator and critic known by many as Lyas. The hastily assembled get-together was Mr. Medini's response to not receiving an invite to the Dior show. ""I was sad and I was like: So what am I going to do? Watch it at home on my TV or in the metro on my phone?"" he said in an interview. Mr. Medini took action. He posted a message on social media in which he invited all of Paris to watch the show with him at Le Saint Denis, a cafe and bar in the city's 10th Arrondissement. He brought his TV from home and arranged the seats to accommodate a modest audience. To his surprise, nearly 300 people showed up. And unlike a traditional fashion show, there was no list at the door, no assigned seating and no opinions drawn out in hushed tones. ""Real people react to art, but fashion people don't,"" Mr. Medini said. ""Is the snobbism so high that you can't even smile?"" ""I really tried to break all of that down and to make it accessible to new people,"" he added. Mr. Medini is used to being a fashion outsider. He grew up in Rouen, a small town in Normandy, France, where he often had no one to discuss fashion with. During the pandemic, he began posting quick, unfiltered reaction videos to magazine covers and runway shows. As his follower count grew, brands took notice and many invited him to their shows and presentations. He quickly learned, however, that while the fashion industry thrives on newness, shaking up the structure and being candid about how he felt about a collection was frowned upon. Especially if he wanted to keep getting brand deals and make a living doing this work. ""It's an industry where no one really wanted to speak their mind,"" Mr. Medini said. ""Me as well. I entered the business and I started shutting my mouth. At one point, I realized that I was losing my integrity and I was losing the very reason that brought me here in the first place."" Mr. Medini said he reached a breaking point after he attended a Dior show by Maria Grazia Chiuri, the company's former creative director, last September. He described it as ""one of the worst shows I had seen at the time"" and decided to post a critical review as a way to ""tell people that I could not be bought."" Because of the negative review, Mr. Medini feared that LVMH, the parent company of Dior, would blacklist him from shows. While he did not receive an invite to Mr. Anderson's show, he said it was for a less dramatic reason: The brand had opted not to invite influencers - a label Mr. Medini bristles at. There were, however, other consequences to the review. He said he was dismissed from his role atInterviewmagazine, where he had been a fashion correspondent, after he ""became a liability."" Representatives for Interview did not respond to requests for comment. Determined to make the best of things, Mr. Medini felt a watch party was a way to reclaim space and open the Dior show up to other fashion fans. To many of the people who attended, it was a perfect solution. ""It's like the Champions League final for the girls and the gays,"" said Nelly Inayetyan, 22, a graphic design student in Paris. ""The atmosphere was so special. For a couple of hours, a regular cafe turned into a buzzing fashion hub."" Ms. Inayetyan, who doesn't consider herself to be a staunch follower of the fashion industry, found the experience inviting. Being able to see a show in the presence of others like her made it memorable...."

54e963b209d5bce4be8e23e2146649ac,2025-07-11 21:02:00,en,WEB,"  Chelsea Odufu is a multidisciplinary artist whose visual language bridges Afrofuturism, cinematic storytelling, and global fine art. From her intercontinental upbringing to her current work with Darren Aronofsky's creative studio, Chromista, Odufu possesses a unique cultural fluency that drives her influence as a genre-crossing artist. Championed by a rare creative partner, Odufu is realizing a bold vision in the fashion industry and beyond. International Origins Though her roots remain in Côte d'Ivoire, Odufu's origins were truly international. It is this lens that has given her a unique eye for global commercial art, fine art, film, and fashion. Through her international lived experience, however, Odufu recognized a key oversight of the commercial art industry: Africa's unmatched visual style is too often overlooked on the world stage. “I think Africa gets overlooked in most of these fashion and travel campaigns,” Odufu explained. “I want to bring us into the conversation. So, as for my personal story—where I began and how it influences me now—it all goes back to Africa. The warmth, its love of people, the colors and clothing, an unmatchable swag.” Building a Multidisciplinary Style Odufu has developed herself into a multidisciplinary artist, seeing herself as genre-fluid. She operates artistically across film, installation, sculpture, design, fashion, music, social impact, travel, anthropology, millinery, and commercial direction, among other fields. Simply put, she isn't one to let a medium define her. “I'm known by Google as a 'film director,'” Odufu shared, “but [I've] made an Afrofuturist steel sculpture that was light-based, with no video elements, purely form and concept. You have to make work for the time and place.” The Challenge of Thought Leadership This willingness to embrace and move between genres has led Odufu to be considered a thought leader in her own right, but it has also created its own challenges. As an artist, she found that there is a certain expectation for creatives to fit into single categories—director, sculptor, designer, or otherwise. Still, as Odufu says, “I don't create for boxes.” Industry Success and Chromista Collaboration Although faced with industry skepticism, Odufu has achieved considerable success through her work. As a director, she has partnered with notable brands such as Chanel, Bose, Doc Martens, and Chase. In the fashion industry, she has successfully launched her hat brand, Astheria. In fine arts, she boasts installations at the Los Angeles Contemporary Art Museum, Paris Photo, Christie's London, and Dakar Biennale, as well as an upcoming show at The Shed. Ultimately, one of Odufu's proudest achievements is becoming a creative talent at Aronofsky's Chromista, a creative content company supporting her unique approach to the arts. Working with Chromista has given her the support to refine her cinematic voice as she continues moving across media. With the company, she has been able to push her commercial and conceptual work in bold new directions. Ambition for the Future Moving forward, Odufu hopes to expand the scope and scale of her projects, collaborating with more influencers, voices, and brands than before to uplift artists from around the world. She particularly hopes to make major avant-garde art projects which showcase her inspiration surrounding her culture and her home continent. With support from Aronofsky and Chromista, she is sure to achieve her goals. Presented by: APG"

mov_FD93FDAE2DCEA4FD405A157CB0F64CD8,2025-07-12 06:00:00,en,WEB,"  It's a daunting task proposing to a jewellery designer, but one that Alex Chandler proved himself more than up to when he popped the question to Kitty Fuller, founder of jewellery brand Kitty Joyas, in 2024. Knowing how important the design would be to his future wife, Alex got in touch with her under a pseudonym (Matthew Percy Jones) to commission a bespoke engagement ring for his girlfriend – with the sole instruction that whatever Kitty would love, he knew his girlfriend would love too. On the day the ring was scheduled to be collected, Kitty was confused to meet not a stranger, but her boyfriend of six years. “I was like, 'What are you doing here?'” Fuller remembers. “He said, 'I'm Matthew', took the ring and got down on one knee.” Kitty approached planning the wedding with all the same artistry and craftsmanship she applies to her jewellery design (every piece is made in her London studio by her and her artisans) – starting with the stationery. The invitations and menus were handwritten and painted by Kitty herself, before being digitised by her mother (who not only hosted the wedding but whom Kitty credits with being a “big part of the creative vision”), a graphic designer by trade. The email listed for RSVPs? None other than Matthew Percy Jones, an adorable Easter egg for those who knew the engagement story. The bride and groom met in Barcelona where Kitty was training as a jewellery designer (hence her brand's name: Joyas means jewellery in Spanish), but they were friends for some time before things became romantic. “It was a bit of a slow burner,” Kitty recalls, “but it's amazing to have basically grown up together”. Kitty says Alex's ability to make her laugh (“he was so much fun, he still is”) was one of the reasons romance blossomed, and a smile spreads across her face as she remembers their early years together: “We were in our carefree twenties, working but not really having to pay much rent and just hopping from beach to beach.” Kitty had imagined her wedding dress before she was even engaged, inspired by a gown she had seen in the Chanel exhibition at London's V&A museum. “I took a picture and sent it to my mum and said 'If I ever get married, this is what I want… In some way.'” As fate would have it, Kitty stumbled across a similar archival style by Alice Temperley at pre-loved bridal store Gillian Million in Teddington. It should come as no surprise that when it came to her wedding look, the jewellery was pivotal to Kitty. “Normally brides want to be quite pared-back with their jewellery because it's all about the dress,” Kitty laughs, “but, obviously, for me, jewellery should be more important.” In Kitty's case, it all began with a brooch. Featuring a citrine central stone surrounded by pearls, it belonged to Alex's late mother. “I always wanted to repurpose something for the day, and I didn't know what until I saw this,” Kitty continues. “I just fell in love with it.” After Alex's father had given his blessing, Kitty set to work turning it into a striking pendant necklace on a string of delicate pearls. On the day, she paired it with matching pearl and citrine earrings and “something borrowed”: her grandmother's engagement ring. In another nod to the couple's Spanish love story, Kitty didn't have bridesmaids, she had  seven, including her sister, “the best chica”. Each wore handmade Kitty Joyas Mi Corazón drop earrings featuring romantic, oversized hearts and organic freshwater pearls. The chicas weren't the only ones to receive custom jewellery for the day: the mother of the bride also had bespoke Kitty Joyas earrings, and Kitty's father and brother had bangles."

Learn more Although the resurgence of the 00s trends has been slowly creeping back in for a while now, it seems it has truly hit its peak recently with the return of the jelly shoes. As soon as luxury brands started sending their own versions down the runway, it became official – they're the shoe of the summer. And in case you needed any more convincing, former Made in Chelsea star Georgia Toffolo has also been spotted wearing a pair during her trip to the Maldives, where she shared a photo declaring: “Jelly shoes are well and truly back and I'm here for it.” She also shared where to shop her exact pair, with her Jelly Slip On Ballet Pumps being a surprisingly affordable £19.50 pick from Marks & Spencer. READ MORE: Olivia Attwood's £46 boucle mini dress gets mistaken for Chanel by fans READ MORE: Louise Thompson's 'incredibly comfortable' Ugg mules are perfect for flying in The jelly shoes are the perfect pick for summer, with the mesh design making them breathable and comfortable to wear, as well as meaning you can wear them on the beach without them filling up with sand. The plastic material also means they should be perfectly fine to wear in the water, so you can paddle in the sea or pop them on around the pool without worrying about them getting ruined. Toff's Jelly Slip On Ballet Pumps also have the classic ballet flat style that makes them easy to wear with a whole host of different outfits. The flat heel also keeps them comfortable enough to be worn all day long. Pair them with jeans and a T-shirt for days in the city, or throw them on with your bikini and a sarong (just like Toff) for an afternoon at the beach. You could also pair them with a flowy maxi skirt or a linen co-ord for more casual evenings out. The M&S Jelly Slip On Ballet Pumps are already selling quickly, with only sizes five, six and seven currently in stock in the red colour. You can however still nab the silvery grey colourway in all sizes from a three to an eight. If you do want a red pair but have missed out on your size with the M&S pair, you could pick up the Juju Jellies Kris In Red from Schuh instead, which are currently on sale down from £26 to £17.99. Alternatively, nab yourself the £29.99 Jelly Mesh Ballet Flats from Amazon which have been compared favourably to The Row's designer version by reviewers. However the Marks & Spencer Jelly Slip On Ballet Pumps have also been getting plenty of positive reviews of their own, with one saying: “Perfect for summer, nice colour, son comfortable and fit well.” Another agreed: “These jelly shoes are really comfortable. I bought the transparent ones and my granddaughter thinks they are glass slippers! I have popped them on to do the school run . . visit a Nursery. . and have dashed into town. I'm so glad I came across them on the website and am happy to recommend them.” Some had some minor issues, adding: “Perfect for the beach. Very comfortable. Wouldn't want to wear them for a lot of walking around as they would make your feet sweat. Feel very light but not much support.” Others however couldn't wait to wear them on holiday, writing: “Just what I wanted for the beach and pool side. Very comfortable and light. Flexible will go in back pack luggage easily.” Join our Shopping & Deals WhatsApp for the best bargains and fashion news WHATSAPP: Get the best deals and exclusive discount codes straight to your phone via our WhatsApp group.

mov_FEB0BF4F87E8DAD917DF37C50629B1D2,2025-07-12 08:09:22,pt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]Durante os desfiles de alta-costura Outono-Inverno 2025 em Paris, Morticia Addams — a sinistra e elegante matriarca da franquia ""A Família Addams"" — pode ser vista deslizando pelas ruas de paralelepípedos da capital francesa. Alta, fantasmagoricamente pálida e com longos cabelos pretos como carvão cascateando pelas costas, esta Addams poderia passar, num olhar rápido, pela atriz Anjelica Huston, que interpretou Addams nos filmes dos anos 1990. Sob os cabelos esvoaçantes, no entanto, está um homem musculoso de 31 anos: Alexis Stone, um artista performático e maquiador conhecido por 1,3 milhão de seguidores no Instagram e centenas de milhares mais no TikTok. Enquanto vários criadores do TikTok hoje habilmente usam maquiagem para alterar drasticamente suas características faciais para se parecerem com celebridades específicas, o trabalho de Stone vai além dos tratamentos faciais completos, chegando a transformações corporais totais, apresentadas ao vivo e em público. Usando próteses, maquiagem de efeitos especiais e aprimoramentos sob medida (como fragrâncias personalizadas), o resultado frequentemente se equipara ao tipo de execução que se vê nas telonas. ""Acho que as pessoas têm a ideia de que vamos a uma loja de Halloween e compramos essas coisas no balcão, mas tudo é feito à mão e leva décadas de experiência para montar"", disse Stone. Em junho, ele guiou a CNN em um tour por seu apartamento em Glasgow, Escócia. Aqui, em sua casa, é onde os protótipos e looks finais são desenvolvidos. Personificar Huston como Addams foi um processo de oito semanas que exigiu pesquisa intensiva, disse Stone. ""Queríamos fazer referência o mais próximo possível à Addams original, desde a peruca original até seu icônico vestido preto de lantejoulas rasgado (ambos obtidos do departamento de figurino do filme)"", explicou Stone. Sobre uma longa mesa de madeira estão Polaroids, tiradas pelo cabeleireiro e designer de perucas Paul Huntley nos anos 90, de Huston e seu falecido colega de elenco Raul Julia, que interpretou o papel do marido Gomez Addams. ""Todas as fotos são originais, então por favor seja cuidadoso com elas"", diz uma mensagem anexa. ""Há muitas partes móveis, desde a escultura e fabricação de moldes até a equipe de cabelo, que começará a trabalhar nas perucas e sobrancelhas. Ocasionalmente, tenho lentes de contato feitas sob medida"", disse Stone. O quarto onde ele principalmente desenvolve suas próteses tem um espelho gigante e ring light, além de prateleiras de tintas, moldes faciais e outras ferramentas de oficina — o tipo de configuração vista na refilmagem para TV de 2024 de ""O Dia do Chacal"". ""É o mesmo tipo de produção, prazos e orçamentos que você vê na indústria do cinema e da TV — exceto que estamos fazendo isso para a vida real"", observou Stone. Esses orçamentos, ele disse, podem chegar a seis dígitos. Stone, cujo nome legal é Elliot Joseph Rentz, frequenta a Semana da Moda de Paris duas vezes por ano sob o disfarce de uma celebridade, um personagem famoso ou uma celebridade interpretando um personagem famoso. Essas personalidades incluíram Jack Nicholson, Lana Del Rey, Madonna, Adele, Jennifer Coolidge e Glenn Close como Cruella de Vil do remake do filme ""101 Dálmatas"" de 1996. O maquiador deixou sua cidade natal, Brighton, Inglaterra, aos 16 anos e circulou por Londres, Manchester, Luleå na Suécia e Nova York, antes de se estabelecer em Glasgow. Vindo do que ele descreveu como uma família ""desestruturada"", Stone se interessou pela ideia de se transformar em outra pessoa desde jovem. ""Quando eu era criança, eu adorava ser irreconhecível, usar perucas, roupas acolchoadas e dentes postiços, e acho que isso naturalmente evoluiu. Acalmar minha criança interior me vestindo não era necessariamente uma direção que eu estava mirando, mas é algo em que caí, e tem sido uma jornada interessante"", disse Stone. Em 2018, Stone alcançou notoriedade internacional ao convencer seguidores das redes sociais de que havia se submetido a extensivas cirurgias plásticas ao longo de seis meses, incluindo um procedimento mal sucedido — apenas para depois revelar que tudo era uma farsa. ""No núcleo do meu trabalho está realmente essa expressão de identidade e o uso do poder da maquiagem"", disse Stone. O ponto de virada na carreira de Stone foi participar do desfile da Balenciaga em março de 2022 como o personagem de Robin Williams em ""Uma Babá Quase Perfeita"". ""Eu não era bem versado no mundo da moda, mas Demna (o estilista da marca) tinha encontrado meu trabalho, e decidimos trabalhar juntos"", disse Stone. Desde então, Stone tem sido presença constante na primeira fila da semana de moda — comparecendo aos desfiles da Balenciaga, assim como Diesel, Jean Paul Gaultier e Hugo Boss — sempre com a semelhança impressionante de um rosto familiar. Hoje, não é incomum ver sósias de celebridades em eventos de moda. Uma sósia de Kate Moss (que se autodenomina ""Fake Moss"") criou um frenesi nas redes sociais em 2023 quando foi vista em um supermercado Aldi em Manchester antes do desfile da Chanel. Em 2024, ela desfilou para a marca emergente Marine Serre. No ano passado, a marca de moda Alexander Wang chamou atenção por usar sósias de Ariana Grande, Taylor Swift, Beyoncé e Kylie Jenner em uma campanha publicitária. O anúncio, publicado pela marca no Instagram e TikTok, tinha a legenda ""100% autenticidade certificada"". ""As marcas adoram fazer parte dessas ações virais"", disse Stone. ""É, em essência, a campanha de marketing definitiva porque é uma espécie de outdoor ambulante, e muitas pessoas reconhecem esses personagens cult ou clássicos, tendo crescido assistindo a eles. Para as marcas, esta é uma forma de fazer parte dessa magia"". As aparições de Stone resultaram em ampla cobertura em revistas de moda, incluindo Vogue e Grazia, e têm fascinado o público. ""Alexis Stone é pago para fingir ser uma celebridade idosa ou o quê? Qual é a dele?"" diz o título de uma discussão no Reddit. Outros usuários comentaram, elogiando Stone por sua ""incrível habilidade"" de se misturar como ""um camaleão"". Até hoje, Stone já experimentou pelo menos 250 metamorfoses de celebridades. Entre seus looks mais bem-sucedidos estava a emulação de Meryl Streep como Miranda Priestly de ""O Diabo Veste Prada"" em 2024. Uma única postagem no Instagram compartilhada por Stone de sua transformação na personagem implacável alcançou um notável valor de mídia espontânea de $1,4 milhão — o valor monetário da exposição na mídia que uma marca recebe, incluindo menções, compartilhamentos e artigos — com uma impressionante taxa de engajamento de 59,6%, segundo a empresa de análise Lefty. (A taxa média de engajamento para posts de mídia e entretenimento no Instagram é de 3%, de acordo com a plataforma de gestão de redes sociais Hootsuite.) A chave do sucesso de Stone está em sua abordagem abrangente. Quando o artista visual se propôs a se tornar uma réplica de Jack Nicholson no ano passado, ele não apenas mandou fazer dentaduras personalizadas (criadas por um especialista em efeitos especiais) que imitavam o sorriso característico do ator; ele também trabalhou com um perfumista para desenvolver uma fragrância personalizada que cheirava a tabaco, capturando o que ele imaginava que Nicholson poderia cheirar. ""Torna-se mais uma experiência imersiva do que apenas visual"", disse Stone. Quando ele usou o perfume no desfile, disse que ""a sala inteira acabou fedendo"". Para criar seus looks, Stone tem trabalhado com vários especialistas em próteses e efeitos especiais, incluindo Neill Gorton, o designer de próteses conhecido por seu trabalho em filmes como ""O Resgate do Soldado Ryan"" (1998), ""Filhos da Esperança"" (2006) e ""Doctor Who..."

Infractorii au furat genți de lux Chanel, Hermès și Dior. Cum au reușit lovitura? Un jaf de proporții a fost dat în doar 20 de minute, cu o pagubă estimată la un milion de euro. Peste o sută de genți ale mărcilor Hermès, Dior, Louis Vuitton și Chanel au fost furate după ce hoții au escaladat spectaculos un balcon aflat la etajul al patrulea. Care a fost planul ingenios din spatele spargerii? Tâlharii au orchestrat un jaf de un milion de euro în doar 20 de minute Un magazin de marochinărie de lux, specializat în produse second-hand, a fost lovit de un jaf spectaculos în zorii zilei de duminică, în Paris. Potrivit informațiilor transmise de AFP, infractorii au sustras genți de la cele mai prestigioase branduri, precum Chanel, Hermès și Dior, în valoare totală estimată la aproximativ un milion de euro. Incidentul s-a petrecut în jurul orei 05:00, pe celebra stradă rue du Faubourg Saint-Honoré, situată în arondismentul 8, o zonă recunoscută pentru concentrarea numeroaselor magazine de lux. Hoții au adoptat o metodă îndrăzneață și bine planificată: au escaladat balconul de la etajul al patrulea al magazinului „Houlux”, au pătruns în interior și, după ce au dezactivat cu rapiditate sistemul de alarmă, au început să arunce gențile pe fereastră. Un complice a așteptat în exterior, preluând imediat bunurile sustrase și încărcându-le într-un vehicul pregătit pentru fugă. Operațiunea a durat aproximativ 20 de minute, timp în care au fost furate peste o sută de genți exclusiviste, incluzând pe lângă Chanel, Hermès și Dior, și modele Louis Vuitton. Valoarea totală a acestora este estimată la aproximativ un milion de euro, fără taxe. Ce măsuri au luat autoritățile după jaf? Parchetul din Paris a demarat o anchetă pentru furt calificat, iar cazul a fost preluat de brigada pentru reprimarea banditismului (BRB). Până în acest moment, autoritățile nu au anunțat niciun suspect reținut, iar investigațiile continuă pentru identificarea și prinderea făptașilor."

mov_2F001EE85F9800CFBC41F294887B3E4C,2025-07-12 10:38:03,ja,WEB,  SPR_COMBO[ja]写真左から「シャネル」「バレンシアガ」「メゾン マルジェラ」　「ジョルジオ アルマーニ プリヴェ」 メンズコレクション終了後、1週間を空けてスタートしたオートクチュール・コレクション。 2025年7月7日から10日までの4日間、パリ市内の各所でショーが開催された。 主催するパリ・オートクチュール組合の公式カレンダー上では、今季は昨シーズンの28から1つ減の27ブランドが参加。 「ディオール（DIOR）」や「ヴァレンティノ（VALENTINO）」、ジャン・ポール・ゴルチエのクチュールライン、「ゴルチエ パリ（GAULTIER PARIS）」等がコレクションを発表せず、久々に「アデリーヌ アンドレ（Adeline André）」等が参加するなどの増減が見られた。 その「ゴルチエ パリ」は、毎シーズン、注目度の高いデザイナーを迎えてコレクションを発表していたが、前回のルドヴィック・サン・セルナンによるコレクションをもってゲスト・デザイナー制は終了。 今年4月に、デュラン・ランティックがパーマネントなアーティスティック・ディレクターに就任。 9月のレディースコレクションに向けて始動し、来年の1月にはオートクチュール・コレクションの発表も予定されているという。 今季のトピックは、何よりも「メゾン マルジェラ（Maison Margiela）」と「バレンシアガ（BALENCIAGA）」だった。 ジョン・ガリアーノが去り、クリエイティブ・ディレクターにマルタン・マルジェラと同郷のベルギー人、グレン・マーティンスが着任した「メゾン マルジェラ」。 マーティンスが「Y/プロジェクト（Y/PROJECT）」で見せていたシュールレアリスティックな手法が、「メゾン マルジェラ」でどのような化学反応を引き起こすのか、大いに注目を集めた。 一方の、デムナによる最終コレクションとなった「バレンシアガ」は、オートクチュール会期中に終了したデムナの懐古作品展「Balenciaga by Demna」と共にメモリアルなものとなった。 来季は、ピエールパオロ・ピッチョーリによる「バレンシアガ」、ジョナサン・アンダーソンによる「ディオール」、マチュー・ブラジによる「シャネル（CHANEL）」、サラ・バートンによる　「ジバンシィ（GIVENCHY）」、そしてデュラン・ランティックによる「ゴルチエ パリ」と、全て出揃うかは現時点で不明ではあるものの、期待値の高いシーズンとなりそうである。 シャネル（CHANEL） Courtesy of CHANEL 今季もクリエイション・スタジオによるコレクションを、グラン・パレにて披露した「シャネル」。 ガブリエル・シャネルが度々イメージソースにして来たイギリスの田園風景や、スコットランドの荒野にインスパイアされた。 アイボリーやブラウン、グリーン、ブラックなどナチュラルなカラーパレットで構成。 ガブリエル・シャネルが好み、ファインジュエリーでも度々登場する麦穂のモチーフが随所にあしらわれ、自然の要素を滲ませた。 フランスでは、麦穂は豊穣の象徴としてのラッキーチャーム。 刺繍を施したツイードのドレスでスタートしたが、シンプルでマニッシュな印象。 ガブリエル・シャネルがメンズのスーツからインスパイアされて、「シャネルスーツ」を編み出したことを想起させた。 羽を飾ったケープにもツイードのメンズライクなワンピースを合わせ、ニーハイブーツをコーディネートしてモダンで若々しいスタイリングに。 チェーンを飾った黒のツイードのセットアップは、甲冑のような力強さを見せる。 麦穂のテクスチャーを思わせるツイードのブルゾンには、シルクサテンのドレープスカートを合わせて、スポーティでマスキュリンなアイテムに敢えてフェミニンなアイテムを組み合わせてコントラストを見せる。 フリンジをあしらったセットアップやワンピースも、フォルムはシンプルでマニッシュな印象。 シルクサテンのロングドレスにも、羽を刺繍してファーのように仕立てたメンズコートをコーディネートして、マスキュリン・フェミニンに。 ラグランスリーブのカーディガン風のツイードジャケットには、プリーツシフォンのスカートを合わせ、適度なカジュアルさを演出。 フェミニンなドレス一辺倒にするのではなく、敢えてマスキュリン・スポーティに仕上げて、ウルトラモダンなクチュールの世界観を描いて見せていた。 メゾン マルジェラ（Maison Margiela） Courtesy of Maison Margiela 文化複合施設である104（サン・キャートル）を会場に、オートクチュールと同等に扱われるアーティザナルコレクションのショーを開催した、新任のグレン・マーティンスによる「メゾン マルジェラ」。 104は、2008年9月にマルタン・マルジェラ本人による最終コレクションが発表された場所で、今季は全てのモデルにマスクが合わせられたことからも、オリジナルへのオマージュ・リスペクトを印象付けた。 今季は、フランドル地方の中世建築からインスパイア。 ゴシック建築に見られる彫像や教会に飾られる聖人たちの彫像、北ヨーロッパのルネッサンス期の邸宅のインテリア、16世紀のフランドル地方のエンボスによるレザーの壁紙、象徴主義の画家ギュスターヴ・モローの作品などにイメージを求め、ベルギー出身のデザイナーらしいダークかつ耽美な世界観を披露している。 透明のプラスチックドレスでスタート。 インナーに同素材のコルセットを合わせ、脚元にはアクリルウェッジソールの「タビ」サンダル。 ギュスターヴ・モローの筆致を思わせるハンドペイントを施したストレッチサテンのセットアップにも、プラスチックのプラストロンをコーディネート。 16世紀のフランドル地方のレザー製壁紙のモチーフをプリントした、金属糸を織り込んだファブリックによるドレスは、ハートの形にシェイプされ、ドラマティックな一点となった。 アップサイクルされたバイカージャケットにも、16世紀のフランドル地方のレザー製型紙のパターンをコピーした紙を貼り付け、敢えて朽ち果てて行く様を表現。 17世紀のオランダの静物画に登場する羽のイメージをプリントしたファブリックをカットアップして繋いだスカートや、アップサイクルされたヴィンテージのネックレスを繋いだニットドレス、17世紀のオランダの静物画に描かれた花をプリントして花をカットして縫い付けたプラスチックのコート。 そのどれもがこのブランドらしいシュールレアリスティックな手法に則っている。 アップサイクルされた素材をあしらうというコンセプトを守りつつ、より手の込んだ徹底した作品作りの姿勢を見せていた。 ジョルジオ アルマーニ プリヴェ（GIORGIO ARMANI PRIVÉ） Courtesy of Giorgio Armani／Photo by Marie-Laure Dutel Israël 「ジョルジオ アルマーニ プリヴェ」は、今年に入ってフランソワ1世通りにオープンさせたパラッツォ・アルマーニにてオートクチュール・コレクションを発表。 ブラックを主軸に据えて、黒というベーシックカラーが持つ究極のエレガンスを表現した。 夜をイメージさせるブルーを差し色にしたテイラードでスタート。 ブロケードや膨れ織り、デボレなど、凹凸感ある素材使いがこのブランドらしい。 プリント地に刺繍を施して絵画的に仕上げたジャケットや、花びらを散らしたような総刺繍のジャケット、抽象画のような刺繍のトップスとテクノ素材のスカートのセットアップなど、一つの時代やスタイルにこだわらない、バリエーション豊かな作品が並ぶ。...

1ly2jy5,2025-07-12 15:01:32,en,REDDIT,"  I picked up [Haramain Floral Fair](https://alharamainperfume.online/products/haramain-floral-fair-100ml-extrait-de-parfum?variant=44270172176441) on a whim, thinking it might just be another pretty floral. But I was wrong—it's not just pretty. It's *elegant*, *sophisticated*, and honestly one of the most well-crafted floral perfumes I've smelled at this price point. This isn't a flowerbomb in your face. This is **a garden in full bloom**, wrapped in morning light, misted with fresh air, and warmed ever so gently by soft earth and skin. Let me walk you through this one ! [img](tbp6xrdhtgbf1) # 🌹 Opening: Soft Petals & Morning Sparkle Right away, you're greeted with **rose**, **bergamot**, and a dash of **ginger**. It's like standing in a garden just as the sun peeks over the horizon—the rose is tender and dewy, not overly powdery or mature. The bergamot adds a light citrus sparkle, and the ginger brings a surprising but *very welcome* bit of warmth and spice. It's luminous, like fresh petals kissed with early morning light. Feminine without being overly sweet. You immediately know you're in the presence of something refined. # 💐 Heart: Creamy, Airy, and Dreamy The heart is where **Floral Fair** truly sings. * **Tuberose** gives it that creamy white floral depth. * **Jasmine** adds a bit of brightness and sparkle. * **White flowers** tie everything together with a fresh, airy elegance. This phase is floaty, but never flimsy. Think bridal bouquet meets blooming meadow—with elegance dialed up to 10. It's modern and clean, but still romantic. People who normally shy away from heady florals might still enjoy this—it's never cloying or old-fashioned. ! [img](wlam0n5itgbf1) # 🌳 Base: Soft Woods & Subtle Sensuality And then, it lingers on a base of **musk**, **patchouli**, and a soft **oak** woodiness. This part is subtle but beautiful. The patchouli is *not dirty or earthy*—it's smooth and just anchors the florals nicely. The **musk** gives it a soft skin-like dry-down, and the **oak** adds a classy, grounded touch that stops this from ever floating off into fairy land. It becomes something you could confidently wear to work or a nice dinner out. # 🧴 Packaging & Presentation 100ml of extrait de parfum (yes, extrait!) in a classy, feminine bottle that matches the elegance inside. It feels weighty, looks great on a vanity, and gives off “graceful woman in control of her life” vibes. # 🕰️ Performance & Projection * **Longevity**: 8-9 hours on skin. Lasts longer on fabric. * **Projection**: Soft to moderate. People will smell it if they're near you—but it doesn't scream. * **Sillage**: A gentle floral trail that leans intimate and inviting. More romantic than bombastic. This is very much a *you'll get compliments if someone hugs you* type of fragrance. # 🌼 Who Should Try Floral Fair? This is for the floral lovers who: * Want something **classic but modern** * Love scents like **Chanel Gabrielle**, **Amouage Honour Woman**, or **Dior J'Adore** but are seeking something more niche-feeling (and affordable!) * Need a go-to fragrance for weddings, spring/summer outings, or daily wear that still feels *special* If you like clean white florals with a creamy, musky finish—**this is it**...."

n2r9paz,2025-07-12 17:13:02,en,REDDIT,"  While fakes have been around a long time, it's not really comparable. Fakes of almost everything from guitars to guitar strings have just exploded since 2020. I've had several sets off of Amazon which I have returned due to being fake. I think twice about buying guitars used these days, too. The worst thing about it is the very guy who decides to order a fake guitar. First it perpetuates the industry of knock-offs. These are the same guys who demand that they are perfectly great guitars, a good tech will set it up to play awesome. Then in that case, why does it need to have a Gibson, ESP or Jackson logo at the top? The reality is most of these guitars are pure junk. Again despite the demands that they're ""better than a real Gibson"", I would question the ability of the person claiming that entirely. And even suggest that they are full of shit. The fakes I have had on my bench are anything but playable let alone comparable. Set necks so offset that they're never going to play right, neck twists so far out of whack it would be a write off on a £20k guitar, bodies that visibly contort in the heat, truss rods that do nothing due to completely improper installation... The second major point is that I'm sure that (the proverbial) you would never attempt to masquerade a fake guitar as real! I am sure an upstanding lad such as yourself would never even consider trying to trade off something you know well to be fake as the real deal. But the guy five owners along from you, are you sure? And ultimately, yes, you share in the responsibility for that guy five ahead of you ripping someone off. As a tech of near on 25 years, I have had the face to face when someone has brought me a guitar to repair that I have had to lay the bad news that it's fake. Most of the guys who get caught are the sort of players who given family life, or what have you, finally get the go ahead from the wife/husband to finally buy a decent guitar after years of raising families, etc. They're middle aged, been saving up a while and suddenly come across something that fits the bill real nice and the guy only wants £2000, not £5000. A lot of these guys are not read up on guitars in general, they just like to play and they want that real American strat, or real Jimmy Page LP, or whatever. Deal done, they think they've had a bargain, it doesn't ever cross their minds that someone actually fakes guitars. These are not gucci wallets or bottles of Chanel no. 5. When I get to tell them that it's firewood, barely worth £100 in scrap, usually due to the very construction of the thing being so flawed, it's not fixable, the realisation that they have been conned is huge. I've seen at least one grown man cry over it. They had one chance to get one nice guitar in life, it took an age to save up let alone get the other half's blessing, and it turns out they've wasted their money and been conned. And if you're ordering this scrap yourself, you are part of that. And sure, you can be all righteous and say, ""Sorry he shoulda done his research!"" If that is what makes you sleep better at night, then your bed is comfier than mine. If you are about the business of ordering fakes of temu or ali or whatever else, don't bullshit me like you have bullshitted your own self. You're a con man and nothing more. And any tech worth their salt would pass on assisting you in making that thing play, or even refitting ""genuine"" hardware to help you pass it off. Any time I've been given a fake to work up, it's gone back to the owner, no work done. If you're a tech, don't support this trade. There is no good genuine reason to buy a fake yourself. If you can't afford the real deal, then tough. Not everybody gets to be an astronaut."

mov_4D155E8DDC7E64401BA05F061B7B8ED4,2025-07-12 18:23:03,en,WEB,"  Imagine discovering your favorite luxury perfume at 70% off retail price, delivered to your doorstep with guaranteed authenticity. This isn't fantasy—it's the reality FragranceNet Discount Fragrances created when it pioneered online discount fragrance retail in 1997. Founded by entrepreneur Steve Lightman in New York, FragranceNet transformed from a modest startup into a global powerhouse, democratizing access to luxury scents through innovative e-commerce strategies. Today, it serves millions of customers across 200+ countries, leveraging cutting-edge technology and direct manufacturer relationships to uphold its reputation for authenticity and value. As the digital fragrance market surges—projected to reach $84.8 billion globally by 2030—FragranceNet's revolutionary model continues to shape how consumers experience luxury. FragranceNet Discount Fragrances: Market Leadership Redefined FragranceNet Discount Fragrances dominates the online perfume landscape through a potent blend of strategic sourcing, technological agility, and customer-centric innovation. By partnering directly with over 1,200 brands (including Chanel, Dior, and Tom Ford), FragranceNet bypasses traditional retail markups, offering authentic perfumes at 20–80% discounts. Its market position is validated by staggering metrics: 17+ million annual site visitors, $500M+ estimated revenue, and a 97% customer satisfaction rate according to 2023 Trustpilot data. The brand's proprietary authentication system—using batch codes and manufacturer verification—combats counterfeit risks that plague 40% of online luxury sales per the Global Anti-Counterfeiting Group. Crucially, FragranceNet built trust through transparency. Every product page details scent notes, concentration levels, and batch-specific expiration dates. Their “365-Day Return Policy” and FDA-compliant storage facilities (audited annually) further reinforce reliability. When supply chain disruptions hit during the pandemic, FragranceNet's diversified warehouse network across the US and Europe ensured continuity—a key reason it gained 32% new customers between 2020–2022 while competitors faltered. Key innovations driving their dominance: AI-Powered Personalization: Algorithms analyze purchase history and reviews to recommend scents, boosting conversion rates by 35%  ScentMatch Technology: Virtual tool matching fragrance preferences to new discoveries  Climate-Controlled Logistics: Preserves perfume integrity during global shipping  Subscription Models: Regular scent deliveries with adjustable frequency The Origins and Evolution of FragranceNet FragranceNet's journey began in a Long Island warehouse, where Lightman identified a gap: luxury fragrances were overpriced due to layered distribution channels. By sourcing surplus inventory directly from manufacturers and authorized distributors, he created a discount model that maintained quality—a novelty in pre-ecommerce 1997. Early milestones included: 1997–2005: Foundation & Early Growth Launched as one of the first online perfume retailers  Secured partnerships with Elizabeth Arden and Calvin Klein  Implemented SSL encryption for transactions (rare for era) 2006–2015: Technological Leap Mobile-optimized site (2010), preceding 75% of competitors  Warehouse automation doubled order processing speed  Expanded into skincare and makeup, increasing SKUs to 15,000+ 2016–Present: Global Scaling Acquired European retailer Parfumdreams (2021), adding 2.2 million customers  Launched eco-friendly packaging initiative, reducing plastic use by 48%  Partnered with influencers like Jeremy Fragrance for authentic reviews This strategic evolution mirrors shifts in consumer behavior documented in Harvard Business School's e-commerce case studies , which highlight how discount models thrive when paired with authenticity guarantees. Industry-Shaping Products and Services FragranceNet's 20,000+ product catalog spans niche artisans to designer icons, but several offerings revolutionized retail: Tester Program: Unboxed bottles used in stores sold at 50–70% discounts. This sustainable model diverted 12 million units from landfills since 2018. Gift Sets & Travel Sizes: Curated collections and miniatures (like Viktor&Rolf's Flowerbomb trio) introduced luxury to budget-conscious millennials. Travel sizes alone grew 200% post-pandemic. ScentClub Membership: For $49/year, members get 20% discounts, free shipping, and quarterly samples—a program retaining 85% of subscribers annually. These offerings reshaped expectations: 68% of buyers now prioritize value without sacrificing authenticity, per 2024 Statista surveys. Technology and Innovation Leadership FragranceNet's R&D investments focus on enhancing accessibility and trust: Blockchain Verification: Pilot program tracing fragrance origins from lab to doorstep  AR Try-On: Virtual scent simulator launching Q4 2024  Dynamic Pricing AI: Adjusts discounts in real-time based on demand/supply Their patent-pending authentication API is licensed to retailers like Sephora, demonstrating industry influence.

Raggiante e inarrivabile come un'imperatrice, Romy Schneider scende dalla scaletta dell'aereo che è appena atterrato a Parigi, accolta da una folla di fotografi. A neanche vent'anni è già una star di fama mondiale e per tutti incarna la grazia e l'innocenza della principessa Sissi, il personaggio che l'ha resa celebre, ma che sta diventando una gabbia che le impedisce di crescere come attrice. Giunta in Francia per conoscere il coprotagonista del suo nuovo film, si indigna scoprendo che si tratta di un giovane e arrogante sconosciuto: Alain Delon. Non immagina certo che l'istintiva antipatia che prova per quel ragazzo ribelle e un po' spaccone, dai capelli nerissimi e lo sguardo di un blu profondo, di lì a poco si trasformerà in un amore folle e tormentato. Svincolatasi dalla tirannia della madre e del patrigno, che vogliono convincerla a impersonare Sissi per la quarta volta, Romy decide di trasferirsi nella capitale francese, dove assapora finalmente la libertà e la passione. Ma la sua carriera rimane in stallo finché, durante una vacanza con Alain in Italia, Romy incontra il grande regista Luchino Visconti che le propone una sfida eccitante: un ruolo a teatro. Sarà proprio lui a suggerire a Romy un cambio di look e a farle conoscere la carismatica Coco Chanel, che trasformerà l'attrice in una vera icona di stile e, nonostante i modi dispotici e irriverenti, diverrà per lei un'intima amica e confidente. Intanto, però, i rapporti con Alain si fanno sempre più burrascosi… Annunci Titolo: Romy Schneider, un amore a Parigi Autore: Michelle Marly Editore: Giunti Genere: Narrativa, biografia Data pubblicazione: 20 Ottobre 2021 Voto: 4-/5 ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Classificazione: 4 su 5. Acquista su Amazon -> #pubblicità Annunci Recensione Bentornati, lettori! Oggi vi presento un altro affascinante volume della serie “Muse, storie di grandi donne” edita da Giunti. Si tratta di “Romy Schneider, un amore a Parigi” di Michelle Marly, un libro che esplora la vita dell'indimenticabile attrice Romy Schneider. Nel 1958, Romy, già una star ventenne, arriva a Parigi, ma si sente intrappolata nel ruolo di Sissi. Qui incontra Alain Delon, un attore emergente per cui inizialmente prova antipatia, ma che diventerà il suo grande e tormentato amore. Romy si ribella ai genitori e si trasferisce a Parigi per cercare la sua libertà. Annunci La svolta nella sua carriera avviene in Italia, dove incontra il regista Luchino Visconti, che le offre un'opportunità teatrale stimolante. Visconti la introduce anche a Coco Chanel, che la trasforma in un'icona di stile e diventa una sua fidata amica. Nel frattempo, la sua relazione con Alain diventa sempre più turbolenta. La narrazione esplora il percorso di Romy alla ricerca di se stessa, tra ambizioni professionali e vicende personali complesse. Essendo una grande appassionata dei film della Principessa Sissi, non potevo non leggere questo libro dedicato alla straordinaria Romy Schneider. Appena ho scoperto che Giunti le aveva dedicato un volume, l'ho acquistato all'istante. Devo ammettere, però, che pur non essendo il peggiore della serie “Muse, storie di grandi donne“, non è nemmeno il migliore. Annunci In alcuni momenti ho faticato a seguire la narrazione, forse perché appesantita da una cronologia troppo rigida dei fatti, quasi fosse una telecronaca. Inoltre, il libro si concentra eccessivamente su un periodo limitato della vita dell'attrice, dando troppo spazio alla sua relazione con Alain Delon, e termina in modo brusco. Mi sarei aspettata molto di più da un testo di questo calibro, come se l'autrice avesse timore di sbilanciarsi. Alla fine, si comprende il motivo di questa reticenza: l'autrice ha conosciuto e frequentato la famiglia Schneider, e probabilmente non voleva fare loro un torto. Nonostante le mie riserve, questo libro ti farà sognare e ti permetterà di scoprire molto di più su Romy Schneider, un'attrice che ancora oggi viene immediatamente associata al volto della Principessa Sissi. Alla fine, il testo mi è piaciuto, anche se sento che gli sia mancato un pizzico di coraggio nell'esprimere appieno la complessità della sua vita. Annunci Lo consiglio vivamente a tutte le appassionate dei film di Romy, perché offre l'opportunità di conoscere a fondo la donna dietro la giovane adolescente che ha interpretato l'imperatrice. Ma c'è molto di più da scoprire, e solo leggendolo potrai svelare tutti i segreti della sua affascinante esistenza! Voto 4-/5.

""Testament à la con et lingots dans les godasses – bienvenue chez les Le Pen Ah, la dynastie Le Pen. On les croyait nés pour sauver la France de l'invasion migratoire, des barbecues halal et de la moustiquette woke, mais les voilà empêtrés jusqu'aux rotules dans une histoire d'usufruit, de notaire et de chiottes bouchées au manoir de Montretout. Car oui, Jean-Marie, le patriarche au rire de hyène et à la blague antisémite bien calée derrière la moustache, a tiré sa révérence en janvier dernier, en lâchant une ultime flatulence testamentaire qui pue encore dans tout Saint-Cloud. Dans son dernier souffle griffonné au Bic bleu sur un papier jauni par la haine et le pinard, il a décidé de baiser tout le monde une dernière fois en léguant l'usufruit de son manoir pourrave à Jany, sa dernière compagne – dite Jany la Douce, sauf quand elle cause pognon. Marine, qui comptait bien se faire un petit magot en vendant la bicoque moisie pour couvrir ses amendes européennes et ses frais d'avocat, s'est retrouvée avec un doigt bien profond dans la confiture. Fini les rêves de liquidité. Place aux huissiers, aux comptes bloqués, aux engueulades en costume Chanel. Jany ne lâche rien. Elle veut son million pour décamper. Et Marine, avec ses procès au cul, ses condamnations en série et ses relents de scandale, serre les fesses. Même la frangine Yann est de la partie, prête à troquer un pot de chambre contre une part de lingot. Quant à l'aînée, Marie-Caroline, celle-là a été rayée du testament comme une faute de frappe, punie d'avoir quitté le nid pour fonder sa petite secte familiale ailleurs. Mais attendez, c'est pas fini. Car cette saga, c'est pas juste des querelles de bourgeoises fâchées autour d'un buffet en acajou. C'est aussi du pognon planqué, des comptes aux îles Vierges, des lingots d'or cachés dans les chaussettes du majordome, et un soupçon de Tracfin pour relever la sauce. Le fameux Gérald Gérin, larbin majuscule et porteur officiel de valises pleines de cash, a déjà goûté aux joies du tribunal pour avoir dissimulé deux millions d'euros en or qui brillait plus que le sourire crispé de Marine un soir d'élections perdues. Ajoutez à ça les petits arrangements immobiliers entre copains facho-péguistes – comme la vente en douce de la villa Bonbonnière à un milliardaire ultra-catho, tout droit sorti d'un roman de Zemmour sous acide – et vous avez une farce tragique digne d'un épisode de Plus belle la Haine. Et dans le fond, qu'est-ce qu'on voit ? Des gens qui, toute leur vie, ont craché sur les pauvres, dénoncé les assistés, hurlé contre les familles décomposées, et qui, au moment de la grande faucheuse, s'arrachent les rideaux, se mouchent dans les testaments, et comptent les biftons sous la table pendant que le cercueil refroidit. Ça chiale, ça magouille, ça promet l'enfer à mamie Jany si elle ne rend pas les clés, tout en tapant sur les migrants qui « profitent du système ». Marine voulait redonner de la grandeur à la France ? Qu'elle commence par faire le ménage dans sa porcherie familiale, où les héritiers de la nation se battent comme des clodos de Neuilly pour un trousseau de clefs et trois bracelets en toc. Ça s'insulte, ça négocie au lance-flammes, et pendant ce temps-là, Jean-Marie repose en paix dans son cercueil tapissé de non-dits fiscaux, en rigolant à moitié dans sa barbe qu'on a oubliée de déclarer au fisc. Mais bon. Chez les Le Pen, tout finit toujours au tribunal avec des effluves de vieille haine et d'héritage moisi."" Allez, rideau. Et qu'on tire la chasse.

Jalis may very well be alive still too, technically. >We know 2 things: revenants use the power of the mists to chanel the power of legendary heros, and death in the guild wars universe involves some aspect of oneself to transfer into these mists, in which you experience the afterlife described by ones beliefs, mostly sorted by race. You do realize that living beings can go to the Mists and even enter the afterlife, right? It's, in fact, done in both games on multiple occasions each. One doesn't need to die to enter the Mists. PvP and WvW are all about going to the Mists. Nayos is in the Mists. We visit Kormir in the Mists. >nor have we received an explanation of how exactly Joko's litch resurrection works. We have though? It isn't resurrection. Liches souls are bound to their bodies, preventing separation. So they never die. They can be defeated, and will often feign death. To quote a GW1 character about The Hunter, a Shiro'ken given lichdom by Vizier Khilbron: *""What is it? * [*The Hunter*](https://wiki.guildwars.com/wiki/The_Hunter) *and the Pack.... Yes I know of them. You've gained the attention of some very powerful beings there. If you are careful, or stronger than you look, you can kill members of the Pack. The Hunter...well the Hunter is a much more powerful being. You see,* ***he's never truly dead****. If you beat him down, he will wait until danger has passed and then regenerate and begin the hunt anew. * ***He cannot be killed. *** *Now, if that is all you require of me, I ask to be free of your presence."" * Vizier Khilbron himself needed his soul torn out of his body by the power of the Bloodstone in the Ring of Fire. And we know that the same is true for Joko, as we witness it ourselves - it took a dragon consuming the magic that bound his soul to kill him. It is not ""resurrection"", it is ""unable to die"". >It's possible something like that operates in such a way that joko exists beyond the veil simultaneously, and that portion of him is what we channel in the mission No, that's definitely not how it's ever shown to work. You're just trying to pull potential explanations out of thin air that isn't even suggested or implied to justify your claim."

Meanwhile, Arianna and Holly face an unexpected threat from Doug's enemies. Elsewhere, Gwen starts throwing her weight around as she demands her rights. The past few weeks on saw EJ trying out desperate moves to save his son. He had Rita deliver the memory card to the DA's office. However, when the authorities saw the recording, only Chanel was seen threatening EJ before his shootout. As such, Jada interrogated Chanel, and Johnny promised to own up to the crime if Chanel was incriminated. The previous week also saw Gwen return to Salem after a long time. On one hand, she refused to give Julie's heirloom necklace back, while on the other, she tried to seduce Xander, who backed out at the last minute. On the other hand, Xander and Sarah tried to find a truce unsuccessfully. As things turned bad between them, Xander forcefully took Victoria with him. Meanwhile, Sarah tried to coerce Philip into testifying against Xander. Tony arrived in town and started strategizing to take back their family business from Titan's takeover. Elsewhere, Sophia gave birth to her baby secretly and dumped it at the fire station. Javi rescued the baby and was granted temporary caretaking of the newborn. The long-running Peacock soap will see these events escalate into bigger problems. : EJ tries desperate measures to save his son Recently, EJ got himself appointed as Johnny's attorney after the latter was arrested for attempted murder. While all evidence pointed to Johnny, the father believed in Johnny's innocence. As such, he had his assistant deliver the memory card to Belle, which he might have doctored to show Chanel threatening him. The upcoming episodes will find EJ DiMera trying hard to remember the real shooter to have his son exonerated. Since his memory will continue to evade him, Belle may suggest hypnosis. Whether they plan to employ Marlena's expertise remains to be seen. On the other hand, EJ may consider pointing his finger at another innocent person to save his son.

The soap's spoilers suggest, Gwen will meet her old friend, Kristen, and the two will likely catch up. As Gwen brandishes her wealth, Kristen will be surprised to learn about Dmitri. She may wonder why Dmitri did not divorce her after being released from prison as per the prior plan. However, Gwen may not give any direct reply about the change in plan.

Meanwhile, Arianna and Holly face an unexpected threat from Doug's enemies. Elsewhere, Gwen starts throwing her weight around as she demands her rights. The past few weeks on Days of Our Lives saw EJ trying out desperate moves to save his son. He had Rita deliver the memory card to the DA's office. However, when the authorities saw the recording, only Chanel was seen threatening EJ before his shootout. As such, Jada interrogated Chanel, and Johnny promised to own up to the crime if Chanel was incriminated. The previous week also saw Gwen return to Salem after a long time. On one hand, she refused to give Julie's heirloom necklace back, while on the other, she tried to seduce Xander, who backed out at the last minute. On the other hand, Xander and Sarah tried to find a truce unsuccessfully. As things turned bad between them, Xander forcefully took Victoria with him. Meanwhile, Sarah tried to coerce Philip into testifying against Xander. Tony arrived in town and started strategizing to take back their family business from Titan's takeover. Elsewhere, Sophia gave birth to her baby secretly and dumped it at the fire station. Javi rescued the baby and was granted temporary caretaking of the newborn. The long-running Peacock soap will see these events escalate into bigger problems. Disclaimer: This article is speculative and may contain spoilers. Recently, EJ got himself appointed as Johnny's attorney after the latter was arrested for attempted murder. While all evidence pointed to Johnny, the father believed in Johnny's innocence. As such, he had his assistant deliver the memory card to Belle, which he might have doctored to show Chanel threatening him. The upcoming episodes will find EJ DiMera trying hard to remember the real shooter to have his son exonerated. Since his memory will continue to evade him, Belle may suggest hypnosis. Whether they plan to employ Marlena's expertise remains to be seen. On the other hand, EJ may consider pointing his finger at another innocent person to save his son. Also Read: I absolutely hate how long Days of Our Lives is dragging out the EJ shooting mystery—now that even Johnny is off the suspect list Gwen Rizczech née von Leuschner recently returned to town and showed off Julie's necklace. However, she refused to give it back, claiming to have bought it fair and square. She also tried to get her old flame, Xander, to bed with her. The soap's spoilers suggest, Gwen will meet her old friend, Kristen, and the two will likely catch up. As Gwen brandishes her wealth, Kristen will be surprised to learn about Dmitri. She may wonder why Dmitri did not divorce her after being released from prison as per the prior plan. However, Gwen may not give any direct reply about the change in plan. Moreover, she may consider moving into the DiMera mansion. As such, she will likely talk to EJ about it. Also Read: How could Gwen's return affect Xander and Sarah's relationship on Days of Our Lives? Explained As Days of Our Lives fans know, moneylenders warned Doug about hurting Holly and Arianna if the former did not pay up. Moreover, a stalker was seen following Arianna.

mov_901EEE498FE9A9028F2FCAE7F7058752,2025-07-13 01:45:01,en,WEB,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com The Real Housewives of Orange County's Emily Simpson was overcome with emotion when she recently revealed that her young son Luke has been diagnosed with a rare eating disorder. The reality TV personality, 49, opened up about her son's diagnosis of Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder (ARFID) during an interview with People. She broke the news shortly after another RHOC star, Tamra Judge, was called out for falsely saying that she had been diagnosed with autism. Before Emily's son's diagnosis, she had always just assumed he was just a picky eater, she told the outlet. 'He only eats a few different foods and he's very overwhelmed by texture, color, smells. He will only eat white rice,' Simpson, 49, said of what Luke's main symptoms are. 'And he has to inspect each piece of rice before he eats it. So it's beyond picky eating. A lot of control issues. It's very overwhelming.' Emily shared that prior to learning about her son's condition, he would often say he was 'starving' — because he was — but would still 'refuse to eat.' 'As a mom, that was so frustrating,' she confessed. 'I didn't know what to do because on one hand he's crying and telling me he's starving, and on the other hand, he refuses to eat anything that I offer.' The condition causes a person to lose interest in eating over anxiety–filled fears of choking, vomiting or a need to avoid unwanted colors, taste, textures or smells of different foods, per the Cleveland Clinic. The Bravo star said that every day is still 'challenging' but she tries to put herself in Luke's 'shoes.' 'Smells are extremely overwhelming for him. Color is overwhelming for him. Textures of food are overwhelming and make him gag,' the reality star said. 'So I have to constantly remind myself that he doesn't operate neurologically like we do.' The Cleveland Clinic states that treatment options include cognitive behavioral therapy and medications like antipsychotic medications, antidepressants or others that stimulate a person's appetite. Emily also took to Instagram to share her thanks to those who reached out to her after the People article was published. 'Hello Friends! ❤️❤️, she began. ' First, thank you so much for your support, kindness and love regarding Luke. 'This was by far my most difficult season filming RHOC I've ever had, and there were multiple times I felt that it was in Luke's best interest for me to quit. 'My reason for continuing on and navigating this truly challenging time (in real time and on camera) was because I knew I'd get more answers, support and feedback than any therapist or doctor could provide. 'The Bravo fans are incredible and caring people, and I wasn't wrong,' she continued. 'Thank you for the information and support you are all sending my way! Please keep it coming and please talk to your children about being kind to the kids who might be a little different ❤️❤️.' She concluded by throwing it back to RHOC, 'Secondly, what did you think of episode one?!' Fans will see her face Luke's diagnosis in real time, since it happened while she was filming season 19 of RHOC. 'There were lots of times I didn't even know if I could continue to film,' she said. ' [Husband] Shane and I are learning every day how to navigate it.' Emily said Luke is currently in therapy and working with a nutritionist. And his diet has expanded to include not only rice but also. french fries, sliced bananas, potato chips, ice cream and plain turkey that 'doesn't have any lines or blemishes in it.' The worried mom admitted that its not easy to tread the line between trying to get him to eat new foods and not making him feel bad that he doesn't want to. Emily and Shane are also parents to son Keller, 10, daughter Annabelle, 12, and Shane's daughters from his first marriage — Chanel, 19, and Shelby, 24."
n2tsyji,2025-07-13 01:45:13,en,REDDIT,"  Is she a believer? Also some sort of check up - I ended up divorcing because of a issue like this one -similar. For me, it was so bad that I could not altogether function in my job - which involves sensitive things. My ""take, for myself, is that even though God hates divorce - and I always thought ""I would never"" - but I did bot want to fail to support my kids. After the split, and since, I have been happy. Just wishing now for a wife (all that I ever wanted was to be married!) . I did agree with her if she got a book to read, then would she please read the one I got; we did also go to a few different counseling sessions - church and the USAF had a marriage counselor also. I ended up reading them both, myself and she refused the one I hoped she would read. .

mov_99ACBD331EACB7B929A211C14A5E0353,2025-07-13 05:08:48,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Schluss mit den negativen Gedanken! Das ist so einfach gesagt, und es will, angesichts der Tatsachen, oft nicht gelingen. Manchmal kann man sich aber für ein paar Stunden aus dem Alltag zaubern. Wenn das passiert, weiß die Kolumnistin, Hopfen und Malz sind noch nicht komplett verloren. In der vergangenen Woche war Fashion Week in Berlin, und man kann es drehen und wenden: Richtig, es ist nicht Paris. Oder Milano, ach Milano! Nicht mal London und schon gar nicht New York, obwohl Berlin dieser Stadt doch so ähnlich sein soll. Das ist natürlich Blödsinn, Berlin bleibt Berlin, New York bleibt New York. Ich darf das sagen, ich wurde in dieser Stadt, also Berlin, geboren, und die Einzigen, die über diese Stadt meckern dürfen, sind die, die hier geboren wurden. Sorry, keine Zugezogenen. Vielleicht, wenn sie 20 oder 40 Jahre hier sind. Wenn es so scheiße ist, kann man ja wieder gehen. Ich überlege sporadisch, zu gehen. Nicht für immer, und ich will auch nicht meckern. Ich will nur einen eleganten Exit. Berlin ist momentan einfach anstrengend, zu aggressiv, zu viele dumme Gestalten, zu viele Angeber, zu viele Schnorrer. Angeber mag ich eigentlich, aber eben nicht die, die sich gerade auf den Straßen Berlins rumtreiben. Und richtig, Veränderung ist super, aber in die falsche Richtung nun mal nicht. Kreativität und Liebe Das war aber gar nicht mein Thema, denn wie zuvor erwähnt, vor Kurzem war Fashion Week und ich hatte mal wieder das große Glück, zu einigen Shows eingeladen zu werden. Leider konnte ich nicht zu allen hingehen, irgendwann muss ich auch mal arbeiten. Was ich gesehen habe, überzeugt mich nicht immer, aber das ist kein Grund zu meckern. Es muss mir nicht alles gefallen. Es soll auch anderen gefallen. Es ist für jeden etwas da. Es ist nicht einseitig, es ist im Gegenteil äußerst vielfältig. GNTM ist überall ... (Foto: IMAGO/Future Image) Die Berliner Fashion Week könnte als Abbild unserer Gesellschaft gesehen werden - oder als Vorbild. Sie lässt die anderen machen: Die Beteiligten meckern nicht, sie machen ihr Ding, sie sind fleißig, sie sehen, was ihre Kollegen leisten. Es hagelt Anerkennung und Liebe, hier regieren die Kreativität und das Handwerk. Firmen wie Marc Cain und Anja Gockel liefern beständig, sie stehen für Qualität und Werte, zeigen ihre Kreationen in klassischen Gebäuden wie dem Pei-Bau des Deutschen Historischen Museums; andere sind jung und strotzen vor Energie, wie Haderlump. Und wieder andere halten sich vornehm zurück, wie William Fan. Die Österreicherin Rebekka Ruétz geht in die Alte Münze und freut sich, obwohl bereits erfolgreich, über den Ritterschlag durch die ""Vogue"", die ihr einen Text widmet. Andere erobern eine Arena: Kilian Kerner, Danny Reinke und Marcel Ostertag lassen ihre Models, sehr viele aus dem Umfeld von GNTM, durch die Uber-Arena stolzieren. Die Meinungen dazu sind geteilt, ob das nun größenwahnsinnig ist oder angemessen – aber dafür ist Berlin ja da: Möglichkeiten zu geben, sie wahrzunehmen, sie zu verwerfen, zu experimentieren. Etwas, das im Rest des Lebens allzu oft verloren gegangen ist. Der Laden ist voll Experimentieren – das ist DIE Eigenschaft, für die Berlin schon immer stand. Jeder, der Erfolg hat, würde sagen, dass Scheitern dazugehört. Jeder, der heute scheitert, kommt sich jedoch wie der größte Loser vor. Dieses Gefühl ist nicht rein Berlin-spezifisch, das ist so in Deutschland. Aber nun gut, ich schweife ab. Der Designer ist ein beliebtes Selfie-Motiv. (Foto: IMAGO/Future Image) Für den Designer und Modemacher Marcel Ostertag ist Berlin die Stadt, der er viel zu verdanken hat. Seit 2006 ist er als Designer aktiv. Er zeigt seine Kollektionen seit 2008 regelmäßig auf der Berlin Fashion Week, 2016 präsentierte er seine Entwürfe auch schonmal in New York. Ostertags Entwürfe sind geschlechterunabhängig, altersneutral und immer kombinierbar. Er bedankt sich nach seiner Show jedes Mal sehr höflich bei seinen Partnern, ohne die eine solche Arbeit kaum möglich wäre...."
mov_4456733AAB12D5D98BDA1F9AE642BDF0,2025-07-13 06:26:00,en,WEB,"  Kynren and Bishop Auckland deliver 'epic' tales and times reports DARREN GREENWOOD YOU may have seen the tv commercials, where Kynren brands itself as “an epic tale of England.” For once, here is an event that totally lives up to its billing. Kynren is a live outdoor show just outside Bishop Auckland in County Durham. The event is back for its tenth anniversary season, which literally does feature a cast of a thousand, not to mention hundreds of animals. RECOMMENDED READING: The thing is, as I was told by its organisers, all bar one in fifty of those taking part are volunteers. And when you think that so many people are showing such great commitment to rehearse, prepare and put on such a brilliant show, at times I did feel a little emotional. There was an amazing amount of professionalism shown, added to magnificent sets, mass choreography, combats, fine horsemanship, not to mention sheep, donkeys and geese, who all behaved perfectly. Now, Kynren is part of the regenerative efforts taking place in and around Bishop Auckland to give the town and surrounds a better future. Kynren is part of the 11Arches charity and I was invited up by them, Visit Durham and the Auckland Project, the latter of which operates a range of attractions in the area, again relying largely on volunteers. As we were told at the start of the show, Kynren is about where you are from, so we get to see recreations of vital moments of British history, with a local twist to reflect the County Durham location. We see how a young boy called Arthur embarks on a quest to experience events over the past 2000 years as he learns so much has happened in England. We see Ancient Britons, Romans, Vikings, we learn about Venerable Bede of Northumberland, jousting knights and then we see the Norman conquest, followed by a journey through agricultural times to the Industrial Revolution, with its coal mines and the Durham Gala. Children, goats and costumes present a colourful night New for this year is a special celebration of the 200th anniversary of the nearby Stockton and Darlington Railway, the birthplace of the modern railway. Kynren's full-scale replica of Locomotion No.1 made a spectacular appearance, crossing the stage. Also new was a reimagined performance of Queen Victoria making an entrance on a six-horse carriage, resplendent with intricate detailing and opulence, not to mention an impressive 150 performers and 20-plus horses. Adding to even more to the spectacle the fireworks, which began before the 20th century seemed to be skirted over, culminating in a grand finale of dancers, animals and the most impressive fireworks display I have enjoyed in years. Departure worked well, with plenty of room for people to leave the 8,000 seat area with ease and there were free buses to take you back to town. You won't go hungry either. There's a food court, which offers a lot of choice, including a tasty chicken curry! Spectacular horsemanship on show Before Kynren started you were able to see a most colourful Viking Village, complete with forge, farmers, traders and warriors all enjoying themselves. I was there for a media launch of Kynren and before the main show started its bosses spoke of their plans for the future. Parrots and other exotic birds arrived to highlight a future show featuring birds, called the Lost Feather. This will be part of the permanent attraction , a historic theme park due open next year. There won't be rides but rather five shows and 'immersive experiences' taking you back through the ages, from neolithic times, the Viking era, the Victoria and reflecting the locality, the story of the Wear and the Lambton Worm. The future theme park , due open in 2026 Also promised is - and epic spectacle where medieval knights clash on horseback, and a fearless female warrior's courage and skill are put to the test in a breathtaking display of horsemanship and daring stunts. It all augurs well and certainly Kynren and its volunteers so professionally bring history so vividly to life across 90 minutes or so. And they face a busy summer, performing every Saturday from next week, July 19, until Saturday September 13. It means that such an amazing show costs from just £30 to £61 for adults (from £20 for children), as so much expense clearly goes on creating such a great and dazzling show, from the performances, the costumes, the stunts, the animals, the spectacle, the fireworks, and so on instead of wages for so many. No wonder Kynren is rated 5-star on Tripadvisor and it rightfully promotes itself as the 'must see event of the summer.' I could not agree more. Royal pagaentry Now, as well as Kynren, Bishop Auckland has other attractions to make a decent stay worthwhile. There's the historic Auckland Palace, with its impressive interior and so many artefacts. There's the rather unique Faith Museum looking at religion throughout history. The Spanish Gallery is the UK's first gallery dedicated to the art and culture of the Spanish Golden Age. It features artworks by El Greco, Murillo, Zurbarán and Velázquez. You certainly get the feeling you are in Spain, and it was a delight to return. Over the road is the Mining Art Gallery with more than 400 works by prominent mining artists such as Tom McGuinness and Norman Cornish exploring life in the coal mines. Again, something great to see again. In addition to these fine attractions, the Auckland Project operates the Park Head Hotel, an excellent 3-star hotel, serving great food. The project also has holiday cottages and townhouses to stay in and the one I stayed was characterful, with period features. It was spotlessly clean with the most comfortable bed. Nearby Raby Castle was also worth the return visit for its 14th Century splendour, the extensive range of artefacts, the gardens and the extensive estate with herds of deer, including white ones, where once more amid its quiet, I felt so relaxed and much at peace. This, my third excellent visit to the area, included The Bowes Museum at nearby Barnard Castle. This has been a museum since its creation centuries ago...."

Come da previsioni con l'arrivo dell'estate ha conquistato le tendenze, tra chi ha ripreso a indossarla in testa, legandola dietro la nuca come andava di moda sin l'estate scorsa, e chi ha provato una nuova modalità: dopotutto siamo nell'era dello styling, dove è tutta una questione di strati e di sperimentare con il layering. La tendenza dell'estate appena iniziata è indossare la bandana in vita, come una cintura. E questo è tutto quello che c'è da sapere a riguardo. Moda estate 2025, indossare la bandana in vita è cool Kylie Jenner e Alexa Chung sono solo alcune delle it-girl che di recente sono state avvistate con indosso una bandana in vita. La prima l'ha sfoggiata su un costume da bagno a stampa floreale, la seconda l'ha abbinata a un paio di jeans blu notte: in entrambi i casi, il foulard è stato ripiegato in modo da formare un triangolo e poi annodato su un fianco, in maniera asimmetrica. Un nuovo fashion hack d'ispirazione boho chic, che contiene in sé altre due grandi tendenze delle ultime stagioni: quella delle maxi cinture statement e quella delle cinture «inutili», sfoggiate non per necessità, ma per personalizzare l'ensemble. Quando indossare la bandana in vita e come abbinarla? Le opzioni vanno dalla vacanza alla città, da una festa in barca a un giro da turista, passando per l'ufficio e qualsiasi altra occasione possa capitare durante la giornata: questo accessorio sta bene con tutto, da un lungo abito estivo come quello di Stradivarius a un copricostume come quello di H&M, da un look total white con pantaloni palazzo a una classica combo jeans e maglietta o camicia. Non c'è nemmeno una regola ben precisa per valorizzarlo. Si può scegliere se optare per un colore a contrasto o rimanere in palette, se non addirittura tono su tono: in ogni caso sarà un dettaglio estremamente cool e inaspettato.

Morgan Riddle's effect on Wimbledon semifinalist Taylor Fritz's rise in the rankings has been significant. He says so himself. A prominent figure at the All England Club this year, the fashion influencer and Fritz's partner, has told her hundreds of thousands of social media followers that tennis has become ""the chicest sport in the world."" While she frequently attends tournaments to cheer for him and was seated at Centre Court on Friday for her boyfriend Fritz's match against Carlos Alcaraz, her profile has also been boosted by features in Vogue, Harper's Bazaar, and The New York Times' Style section, and featured in the Netflix tennis documentary, ""Break Point."" Morgan Riddle went from Minnesota to New York and multiple internships Riddle, 27, is a Minnesota native who attended Wagner College in New York City. “By the end of my junior year, I had completed seven internships,” she said in a Wagner College video about the Class of 2019 member. Riddle explained that the internships included gigs at a magazine, a newspaper, a government office, a coffee company startup and a real estate company, with tasks including social media. Riddle and Fritz met about five years ago. Taylor Fritz credits Morgan Riddle's influence Fritz was the U.S. Open runner-up last September — his first appearance in a Grand Slam final — and reached a career-high ranking of No. 4 in November. He says it's important to have someone “push you in the right direction all the time, supporting you."" He spoke about Riddle's role after his 6-3, 6-4, 1-6, 7-6 (4) victory over Karen Khachanov in the quarterfinals. “There's an obvious correlation between my results and ranking and the time we've been together,” he said. “I would have to say she's been a big help to me, just kind of keeping me focused, having someone who cares and just pushes you to just do better and do the right things, be healthier.” Morgan Riddle promotes fashion and explains 'tenniscore' Riddle has worked with the All England Club to create video segments called “Wimbledon Threads.” Wearing brands such as Chanel and Jimmy Choo, she details trends like “tenniscore.” “'Tenniscore' isn't just about pleated skirts and vintage polos. It's about aspirational minimalism with a competitive edge,” she said in a video titled “How Wimbledon made tennis chic.” She added that Wimbledon has “helped tennis become the chicest sport in the world.” Riddle isn't afraid to throw a few zingers. “Of course, we're here for the tennis, but what was once a strictly sporting event has also turned into a global fashion spectacle. I know some of you may not want to hear that, but just because the fact annoys you, doesn't make it any less true,” she said. That segment has 12,300 views as of Friday — a different Wimbledon video featuring a kid asking Aryna Sabalenka about pancakes has more than double that. Riddle's clips on TikTok, where she has nearly 600,000 followers, are more popular. She also has more than 450,000 followers on Instagram. Fritz often takes photos of her to post on social media. “I've definitely gotten a lot better over the last couple of years but very reluctantly,” he said in an interview last year. “It's very embarrassing in public when I'm taking pictures (and) people are looking at me taking pictures of her. But you got to do what you got to do sometimes. She also takes good pictures of me.”"

The goal of the list was to present a variety of classic, elegant fragrances that cater to different personalities and preferences, moving beyond scents that are merely trendy.

For instance, Guerlain Shalimar was included for its warm, mysterious, and spicy character, while Dior J'adore offers a more modern and luminous floral experience.

And then they cant figure it out and leave it in the lobby like bro RESPOND TO ME COMMUNICATE WITH ME. Also what is UP with people who are like men having photoshopped women faces? It always makes me want to report them. Like their name will be Chanel and their picture will be a woman and then a whole dude pulls up to get me the food."

In the first image, The Kardashians star wore a tiny yellow and black Chanel string bikini as she sat on her knees on the yacht. Kylie tipped her head to one side in the shot and looked like she was rolling her eyes. In another snap, the reality TV star showered off as she climbed back onto the boat after a swim in the sea. In another photo, Kylie poured herself into a tiny leopard print bikini that highlighted her toned figure. She also shared a picture with her bestie Stassie Karanikolaou at a restaurant in a quaint Grecian town. Kylie turned up the heat with a photo of herself leaning against the railing of the yacht in a skin tight, curve hugging white dress. Other photos in the group included a shot of five women's feet in flip flops, a photo of her pink Chanel tote bag and a bunch of nature shots. Khloé Kardashian commented on her sister's post: 'Are you ever coming home?' A fan also mentioned seeing her on the yacht, writing, 'We saw your yacht in paxos!!! We drove past on a boat. hope ur having the best time.' A bunch of other fans commented along the lines of 'Oh girl your life is so fun' and 'what a life.' And many others complimented her beauty with comments such as 'How is someone this perfect' and 'sun-kissed beauty ❤️.' Kylie's trip to Greece comes after she introduced her collaboration with Frankie's Bikinis. The new swimwear collaboration is called Cloud Cups by Frankies Bikinis x KHY. 'I've always loved Frankies Bikinis, and I'm so excited to partner with them to create this collection – with incredibly flattering silhouettes in super soft material, these are the perfect pieces for summer,' Kylie told DailyMail.com in a statement. 'We've incorporated so many fun prints – from polka dots to leopard – and the styles are so comfortable, it feels like they float on your skin while lifting and sculpting. 'One of my favorite pieces is the Heavenly Satin top – the lace detail is so sweet, and it showcases the vintage aesthetic that this collection is all about.' 'Designing this collection with Kylie felt so natural, like two girls dreaming up their perfect swim drawer,' said Aiello, founder of Frankies Bikinis. 'We wanted each piece to lift, shape, and sculpt while wrapping the body in delicate support.' With six bikini top styles, bottoms that range from classic strings to fuller-coverage, and sun dresses and separates, Frankies Bikinis x KHY offers styles for every aesthetic. Beyond swim, Frankies Bikinis x KHY expands into limited edition mini dresses and easy separates. 'KHY aims to redefine the modern wardrobe by offering edited collections that seamlessly blends luxury with everyday style, spanning a diverse range of categories and styles. 'By collaborating with iconic brands and global designers, we hope that KHY will be a platform that delivers access to incredible fashion for everyone,' the company said in a statement. Frankies Bikinis is a female-led lifestyle brand recognized for its on-trend designs, innovative fabrics, and a commitment to crafting styles that make women feel more confident. Founded by mother-daughter duo Mimi and Francesca Aiello in their Malibu home in 2012, the brand has since grown into an internationally recognized company."

The shoes were slightly loose on me but the SA offered me a pair of half leather insoles that goes on the ball of the foot which made the shoes fit perfectly for me and it actually fit more comfortably. Also the color was the same as the shoes so it blended in really well. She said she was going to include them in the box but when I got back home and opened the box I noticed that she forgot to pack them. I've been trying to find something similar on Amazon but I wasn't able to find anything and I don't remember ever being offered these insoles at my local Chanel store in San Francisco. My local store also usually never has my size available. Does anyone know what I'm talking about or where I can find them? I was thinking of visiting the store to ask but I'm not sure if they have them or would be willing to help me since I bought them at a Chanel in Japan. I'm also not a regular at Chanel and wanted to see if anyone here would know before I make a trip to the store.

I'm not sure what the conversation was about but these people handle PR for the King and Harry. I would think if the king was opening up a chanel for him and Harry to communicate it would be via private secretaries or assistant private secretaries. It would not be the communication secretary that would be handing private conversations between the King and his son just my opinion. Maybe the RF wanted to set a truce in discussing family conversations or family affairs to the press maybe having that discussion and palace providing rules for them to follow could than create an atmosphere that Harry and Charles can start communicating again. IMO these are just ways of keeping Harry at bay and pacifying him to an extent. He has not realized this but as long as he is married to Meghan there will be no family reconciliation. I hope he is happy with his children because unless he divorces her, Harry just needs to look forward."

Leo et Violette because the one bag I bought from them felt like a poorly constructed bag from a beginner seller from Etsy. I have zero interest in Chanel or Hermes, but that is more to do with the fact that I can't afford to shop at either. I think Chanel is ridiculously overpriced and I loathe the games that Hermes plays, so I am not sure I'd shop at either even if I could afford them (but, I don't know). Not bag brands, but I will also never shop with SHEIN or Temu because I've got zero interest in getting three million poorly constructed items for cheap knowing they will end up in a landfill and were likely made by children. I am also trying to stop shopping with Amazon. I find that more challenging."

Coco was the designer who started a revolution inspired by her own trailblazing and radical appetite for independence. She liberated women from heavy, corseted clothes, giving them freedom to work, move and celebrate themselves. In a male-dominated world, she was rewarded with unrivalled wealth, recognition and celebrity, counting everyone from Winston Churchill to Cecil Beaton as friends. But despite her triumph, Coco remained an enigma. Until her death in 1971 at the age of 87, she veiled the truth of her poor childhood growing up in an orphanage, her early years as a kept mistress and her sense of being a perpetual outsider. She indulged in complex affairs with men, including - allegedly - the married composer Stravinsky, a grand duke who had fled revolutionary Russia and the wealthy Duke of Westminster, who left her for a younger woman. A wartime romance with a German agent led to accusations of Nazi collaboration and Coco's exile from France for nearly a decade.

Coco is revealed by women who knew her and continue to live and wear her vision. This is the culturally defining exploration of a legend whose work reflects the story of the 20th century.

只要能吃苦，就有吃不完的苦。 全球零售巨头沃尔玛对这句中文梗应该颇有同感。 它刚刚花10年时间解决一场“中年危机”，适应了电商时代，挡住了亚马逊的冲击，公司营收和净利在2024、2025财年都实现了不错的增长。 但就像中年人的世界里总有解不完的难题，进入2025年的沃尔玛，迎来了包括特朗普关税政策在内的一系列不确定因素，接下来的业绩，恐怕也很难保持过去两年的高增长。 受政策影响，这家以性价比著称的零售企业还在美国对部分商品进行了涨价——这可以看作是一场对自己的背刺。 在消费世界里，贵的可以更贵，比如CHANEL年年涨价年年有人追着买，甚至把它当成理财产品看升值空间，但蜜雪冰城把冰激凌和柠檬水卖贵一块钱，是要做好挨骂的心理建设的。 沃尔玛过去几年的业绩增长，其实也不是靠把便宜货卖给勤俭持家的人。 沃尔玛CFO约翰·瑞尼(John Rainey)表示，2025财年第三季度，沃尔玛约75%的增长来自年收入超过10万美元的家庭，咨询公司Morning Consult的调查也显示，年收入10万美元以上的家庭中在沃尔玛购物的比例，自2019年的77%上升至2024年的89%。 而十年前，调研机构Kantar Retail数据给出的沃尔玛顾客画像是：年收入多在5万美元以下，年龄主要为45岁以上——翻译过来就是：扣扣搜搜的中年人。 其实，全世界中产都具备着类似的消费习惯：既要性价比，又要体面。 他们的身影会出现在农村大集上，但这更多是体验烟火气的快乐，他们不会真的为了5块钱一兜的黄瓜坚持复购。 但叮咚买菜的8点打折夜市、好特卖4块钱一瓶的巴黎水，是能卖到他们心坎上的。 所以沃尔玛在这几年增加了不少高级的SKU，提升门店体验，比如使用让人更舒适的灯光色温，增强数字体验，拼命甩掉以前那个廉价、传统的老标签。 一个更重要的进展是，它终于搞定了电商业务——一个它从20多年前就开始涉足的板块。 老大哥的眼光还是很好的，但前期重视程度不够，也没什么章法，发展太慢。 好在它后面补课很努力，慢慢搭起电商基建。 疫情再给了关键性的催化：2020年，沃尔玛美国的电商业务实现了79%的销售增长，到2021年时，它已经成为美国电商行业的老二，仅次于亚马逊。 2025财年，沃尔玛在全球的电商销售额达到1210亿美元，且最近9个季度的增速不低于15%。 电商业务在公司总销售额中的占比达到了17.94%——10年前，这个数字只有2.53%。 图源：沃尔玛2025财年年报 
从财务数据来看，沃尔玛就像是顺利进入新赛道的中年人，又过上了好日子： 
沃尔玛大卖场的销售额，三年增长超900亿美元，从2022财年的4942.06亿美元达到2025财年的5843亿美元——定位类似的家乐福，在相似时间段的2021年和2024年，销售额分别为812.45亿欧元和945.5亿欧元，按照当下汇率，三年增长额不到160亿美元。

人类历史往往是由一些关键人物推动的，老公司们的进化也是如此。 在沃尔玛长达20多年的电商业务故事里，有两位关键人物：一位是在2010年组建起专门电商部门的CEO麦道克(Mike Duke)，相当于把电商部门变成了正规军；一位是他的后一任CEO董明伦（Doug McMillon）。 在2014年2月接任CEO时，董明伦表面风光，47岁的他，是除创始人山姆·沃尔顿外，沃尔玛历史上最年轻的CEO。 他对沃尔玛足够了解，从基层采购员干起，工作接近25年。 过往经历也证明他能打硬仗：他曾经在沃尔玛受金融危机影响而业绩下滑时，临危受命，出任国际业务总裁兼CEO，很快，国际业务成为2011~2013财年公司增长最快的部门。 但提振一块业务，跟带动一艘大船转向，根本上是两回事。 你能把西红柿鸡蛋做好吃，未必能撑起一桌体面的家宴。 2014年的沃尔玛就像是一艘需要打补丁的大船。 营收增速只有个位数，还在2014财年达到有史以来的最低值——1.6%。 净利润也在2012财年出现20年来首次下滑后，于2014财年再次下滑。 更糟糕的是，这艘大船好像有点迷失了方向。 当时美国的电商业务热火朝天。 2010年~2013年，美国电子商务零售销售规模由1654亿美元增长至2630亿美元，平均年增速达到16.6%，远超实体零售业同期6.2%的的平均年增速。 而沃尔玛的电商业务在2014财年刚突破100亿美元的销售额——这相当于隔壁亚马逊电子零售业务在2013年的增长额。 董明伦干了几件事情： 
1、抄作业。 对标亚马逊，从动态价格体系到电子支付，再到发展无人机配送、与出租车公司合作提高即时配送能力，沃尔玛“抄”得很认真。 2、使出“钞能力”，通过收购的方式快速补齐短板。 从2014年-2018年，沃尔玛几乎在全球撒钱，花费超过200亿美元收购了超20家公司。 其中的大头，160亿美元用来买了一家印度电商公司Flipkart——它一度在印度做到了市场第一，还在人工智能方面积累不少。 收购带来的另一大资源是人才。 董明伦在2016年收购美国初创电商平台Jet后，直接安排创始人马克·劳尔（Marc Lore）担任沃尔玛电商部门主管。 也是从这开始，沃尔玛的电商生意挤进了快车道。 在中国市场，沃尔玛尝试过收购1号店来发展电商，最终变成与京东合作，利用后者的配送服务解决物流问题。 这个模式后来被复制到日本，合作对象是当地最大的电商平台乐天。 3、调整店型，抓“小”放“大”。 传统的沃尔玛门店在电商业务中有了“前置仓”的角色，相比大而全，快捷更重要。 于是，沃尔玛放缓了传统门店的扩张速度，对既有门店进行升级改造，做小店。 2015、2016财年，沃尔玛在美国开了260家社区店和中小型门店，而大卖场只开了177家。 这些动作的共同特点就是：费钱、无法立竿见影出成绩、拖累财报数据。 资本市场显然是有怀疑的，2016年下半年，连长期持有沃尔玛股票的巴菲特，也因沃尔玛与亚马逊之间的增速差距过大，选择大幅抛售。..."

人类历史往往是由一些关键人物推动的，老公司们的进化也是如此。 在沃尔玛长达20多年的电商业务故事里，有两位关键人物：一位是在2010年组建起专门电商部门的CEO麦道克(Mike Duke)，相当于把电商部门变成了正规军；一位是他的后一任CEO董明伦（Doug McMillon）。 在2014年2月接任CEO时，董明伦表面风光，47岁的他，是除创始人山姆·沃尔顿外，沃尔玛历史上最年轻的CEO。 他对沃尔玛足够了解，从基层采购员干起，工作接近25年。 过往经历也证明他能打硬仗：他曾经在沃尔玛受金融危机影响而业绩下滑时，临危受命，出任国际业务总裁兼CEO，很快，国际业务成为2011~2013财年公司增长最快的部门。 但提振一块业务，跟带动一艘大船转向，根本上是两回事。 你能把西红柿鸡蛋做好吃，未必能撑起一桌体面的家宴。 2014年的沃尔玛就像是一艘需要打补丁的大船。 营收增速只有个位数，还在2014财年达到有史以来的最低值——1.6%。 净利润也在2012财年出现20年来首次下滑后，于2014财年再次下滑。 更糟糕的是，这艘大船好像有点迷失了方向。 当时美国的电商业务热火朝天。 2010年~2013年，美国电子商务零售销售规模由1654亿美元增长至2630亿美元，平均年增速达到16.6%，远超实体零售业同期6.2%的的平均年增速。 而沃尔玛的电商业务在2014财年刚突破100亿美元的销售额——这相当于隔壁亚马逊电子零售业务在2013年的增长额。 董明伦干了几件事情： 
1、抄作业。 对标亚马逊，从动态价格体系到电子支付，再到发展无人机配送、与出租车公司合作提高即时配送能力，沃尔玛“抄”得很认真。 2、使出“钞能力”，通过收购的方式快速补齐短板。 从2014年-2018年，沃尔玛几乎在全球撒钱，花费超过200亿美元收购了超20家公司。 其中的大头，160亿美元用来买了一家印度电商公司Flipkart——它一度在印度做到了市场第一，还在人工智能方面积累不少。 收购带来的另一大资源是人才。 董明伦在2016年收购美国初创电商平台Jet后，直接安排创始人马克·劳尔（Marc Lore）担任沃尔玛电商部门主管。 也是从这开始，沃尔玛的电商生意挤进了快车道。 在中国市场，沃尔玛尝试过收购1号店来发展电商，最终变成与京东合作，利用后者的配送服务解决物流问题。 这个模式后来被复制到日本，合作对象是当地最大的电商平台乐天。 3、调整店型，抓“小”放“大”。 传统的沃尔玛门店在电商业务中有了“前置仓”的角色，相比大而全，快捷更重要。 于是，沃尔玛放缓了传统门店的扩张速度，对既有门店进行升级改造，做小店。 2015、2016财年，沃尔玛在美国开了260家社区店和中小型门店，而大卖场只开了177家。 这些动作的共同特点就是：费钱、无法立竿见影出成绩、拖累财报数据。 资本市场显然是有怀疑的，2016年下半年，连长期持有沃尔玛股票的巴菲特，也因沃尔玛与亚马逊之间的增速差距过大，选择大幅抛售。..."

只要能吃苦，就有吃不完的苦。 全球零售巨头沃尔玛对这句中文梗应该颇有同感。 它刚刚花10年时间解决一场“中年危机”，适应了电商时代，挡住了亚马逊的冲击，公司营收和净利在2024、2025财年都实现了不错的增长。 但就像中年人的世界里总有解不完的难题，进入2025年的沃尔玛，迎来了包括特朗普关税政策在内的一系列不确定因素，接下来的业绩，恐怕也很难保持过去两年的高增长。 受政策影响，这家以性价比著称的零售企业还在美国对部分商品进行了涨价——这可以看作是一场对自己的背刺。 在消费世界里，贵的可以更贵，比如CHANEL年年涨价年年有人追着买，甚至把它当成理财产品看升值空间，但蜜雪冰城把冰激凌和柠檬水卖贵一块钱，是要做好挨骂的心理建设的。 沃尔玛过去几年的业绩增长，其实也不是靠把便宜货卖给勤俭持家的人。 沃尔玛CFO约翰·瑞尼(John Rainey)表示，2025财年第三季度，沃尔玛约75%的增长来自年收入超过10万美元的家庭，咨询公司Morning Consult的调查也显示，年收入10万美元以上的家庭中在沃尔玛购物的比例，自2019年的77%上升至2024年的89%。 而十年前，调研机构Kantar Retail数据给出的沃尔玛顾客画像是：年收入多在5万美元以下，年龄主要为45岁以上——翻译过来就是：扣扣搜搜的中年人。 其实，全世界中产都具备着类似的消费习惯：既要性价比，又要体面。 他们的身影会出现在农村大集上，但这更多是体验烟火气的快乐，他们不会真的为了5块钱一兜的黄瓜坚持复购。 但叮咚买菜的8点打折夜市、好特卖4块钱一瓶的巴黎水，是能卖到他们心坎上的。 所以沃尔玛在这几年增加了不少高级的SKU，提升门店体验，比如使用让人更舒适的灯光色温，增强数字体验，拼命甩掉以前那个廉价、传统的老标签。 一个更重要的进展是，它终于搞定了电商业务——一个它从20多年前就开始涉足的板块。 老大哥的眼光还是很好的，但前期重视程度不够，也没什么章法，发展太慢。 好在它后面补课很努力，慢慢搭起电商基建。 疫情再给了关键性的催化：2020年，沃尔玛美国的电商业务实现了79%的销售增长，到2021年时，它已经成为美国电商行业的老二，仅次于亚马逊。 2025财年，沃尔玛在全球的电商销售额达到1210亿美元，且最近9个季度的增速不低于15%。 电商业务在公司总销售额中的占比达到了17.94%——10年前，这个数字只有2.53%。 图源：沃尔玛2025财年年报

Chanel la acompaña en esta conversación sobre mirada, oficio, inspiración y paso del tiempo Antes de llegar a la intimidad diaria de sus lectores a través de la ventana que es Instagram, Leticia Sala (Barcelona, 1989) utilizaba las palabras para argumentar, redactar demandas, pensar como abogada. Estudió Derecho, trabajó un tiempo en el sector jurídico y lo dejó cuando se dio cuenta de que el suyo era otro lenguaje. Ha publicado (2018), (2020) y(2023), dos libros donde la emoción se expresa con precisión y sin aspavientos. También ha escrito letras para otros: colaboró con Rosalía en y , y ha trabajado como guionista y creativa para marcas como Loewe o . Desde hace más de dos años responde a la fidelidad de sus lectores cada semana con la, un guiño explícito a Joan Didion, a quien admira. Lo suyo no es la confesión sino la observación. Lo suyo es saber mirar, y saber contarlo. ¿Tiene un lugar favorito para escribir? Sí, el sitio donde más escribo es el comedor de mi casa. No es un estudio, pero como estoy sola mientras escribo, no me importa que sea una zona común. Desde ahí veo edificios y una piscina que ni siquiera es del edificio. No diría que me inspira, pero me recuerda que no estoy sola. Y aunque necesito soledad para escribir, también necesito sentirme acompañada, notar que hay vida alrededor. Tenue atardecer Crema con camelia roja Nº1 de Chanel, sérum revitalizante para ojos Nº1 de Chanel y agua de maquillaje Les Beiges de Teint Light. Los pómulos y ojos se iluminan con los polvos Les Beiges Belle Mine Naturelle light coral y las cejas se perfilan con el lápiz Stylo Sourcils Waterproof Blond Doré. En los labios, Rouge Coco Flash Sunse ¿Escribe muchas horas al día? En los últimos años, sí. Desde que lancé la , escribo prácticamente todos los días. A eso se suman encargos, artículos, correcciones, ideas que intento desarrollar. Intento no escribir un día y medio a la semana, normalmente el fin de semana, para conservar cierta distancia con lo que hago y no saturarme. Dicen que hay dos tipos de escritores: los que escriben porque tienen la necesidad de escribir y los que lo hacen para ser leídos. ¿En qué grupo se ubica? Durante mucho tiempo creí que escribía para ser leída. Es mi forma de comunicarme con el mundo, de encontrar un lugar. Pero cuando mi hija nació y estuvo en neonatos, lo primero que hice fue escribir en las notas del móvil. No pensaba en nadie más que en mí. Fue una forma de entender lo que estaba viviendo. Aquel texto, tiempo después, se convirtió en literatura, pero en ese momento era algo visceral. Eso me hizo repensar la raíz de por qué escribo. La hora dorada Crema para contorno de ojos, sérum en bruma revitalizante para rostro y cuerpo. En pómulos, Les Beiges Belle Mine Lumiere Dorée Éclat du Soir, y en los ojos, máscara Le Volume. En los labios, Rouge Coco Flash Sun Bliss. Todo de Chanel ¿La maternidad ha transformado su escritura? No creo que haya cambiado los temas, pero sí los ha profundizado. La maternidad, los vínculos, la amistad, el amor, los traumas heredados... ya estaban ahí antes, pero ahora los abordo con otra perspectiva. También porque he leído más, he vivido más. Supongo que es un proceso inevitable, y en el fondo, enriquecedor. ¿Se considera nostálgica? Me encanta la nostalgia, me resulta inspiradora. Siempre he navegado bien en ella. Pero la maternidad me obliga a estar muy en el presente, a una presencia física constante. Eso hace que me cueste más abandonarme a esos estados, y lo echo de menos. La nostalgia era un refugio. Y aunque necesito soledad para escribir, también necesito sentirme acompañada, notar que hay vida alrededor”..."
