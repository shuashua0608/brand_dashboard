F516526B4CD550CACC9AB743197B0E18,2025-07-01 07:17:02,en,PRINT,"  The end of Anna Wintour's 37-year run as editor in chief of Vogue was a lot less dramatic than its beginning. Back in 1988, magazines ruled fashion, anointing people and decreeing trends, and it was a cloistered world of high drama and higher expense accounts. When Ms. Wintour was chosen to replace the legendary editor Grace Mirabella, it was a scandal -- Ms. Mirabella learned she was fired from her husband, who called after he saw it on the evening news. But when Ms. Wintour announced on June 26 that she was relinquishing the role, it felt more like a corporate governance move than a revolution that will shake the entire industry she has ruled over for decades now. For one thing, she retains her job as Vogue's global editorial director and will stay on as chief content officer for Condé Nast. It was less her retiring than the retiring of a once-imperial, no longer so powerful title: editor in chief. Ms. Wintour will appoint a head of editorial content in her stead. That definitely sounds a lot less glamorous. What well-connected, well-brought-up young person, as Ms. Wintour was -- her father was a respected editor of The London Evening Standard -- dreams of being head of editorial content someday? But this was many decades before everything once rarefied got flattened into digital imagery suitable to view on your phone and became just ''content.'' When Ms. Wintour started out, she was styling outfits, selecting photographers and flying off to help create impossibly gorgeous fantasies for the magazine's pages. Now low-level Vogue jobs include community manager, which demands the ''ability to generate multiple revenue streams driven from content.'' And commerce marketing editor, the ''ideal candidate'' being one who ''enjoys analyzing traffic and conversion results as much as they do creating content.'' The idea that a job at Vogue -- even as an assistant with duties that have included printing fliers for Ms. Wintour's missing dog and fetching her Starbucks lattes -- was one any girl would kill for has faded during her reign. Now, Condé Nast's former 4 Times Square headquarters is home to TikTok. The Frank Gehry-designed cafeteria still stands, but without the magic of the days when young editors might bump into exotic fashion legends like Grace Coddington at the salad bar. Yes, there are still front rows to sit in, parties to attend. But the day to day of the job is overseeing a tangle of revenue and content streams. These include social media channels, a podcast, YouTube, a website and a print magazine. The staff, once a menagerie of international nepo babies, is now largely unionized. The glory of dominating the newsstand with a carefully photographed and chosen subject has been replaced by views, followers and amorphous online impressions. The idea that an Anna Wintour can dictate taste -- who and what are in or out -- seems wildly dated. Remember the scene in ''The Devil Wears Prada'' where the character she inspired, Miranda Priestly, lectures her assistant, saying, ''It's sort of comical how you think that you've made a choice that exempts you from the fashion industry when, in fact, you're wearing a sweater that was selected for you by the people in this room''? Thanks to huge interest in the Met Gala, a physical manifestation of who and what clothes are and aren't Vogue, Ms. Wintour has retained her gate-keeping prowess somewhat, but it's unclear whether her successor will have (or will want to have) that power. Ms. Wintour and her trademark bob already feel like a relic. But Anna Wintour was always more than her job. She became famous herself, with friends such as Colman Domingo, Bradley Cooper, Donatella Versace and Miuccia Prada. She was never some algorithm trying to give us more of what it thinks we want or something driven by A.I. She was a person who judged and decided based on her own haughty sense of what was the best. Whoever takes her place will not shape culture or tastes the same way her Vogue did. It's a version of Vogue that many will not miss, one that was slow to move on from prizing thinness and whiteness and a Eurocentric ideal of beauty according to Ms. Wintour's exacting vision for many years. If Ms. Wintour were starting her career today, with a famous last name, a healthy financial cushion and a designer wardrobe, it's easy to imagine her dreaming of starting a company, as Phoebe Gates did. Maybe it would be a tech start-up or a beauty brand or a sunglasses line. Maybe she'd become a podcaster and TikTok influencer. She surely wouldn't be in her bedroom poring over slide shows of products to buy on Vogue.com, dreaming of driving conversions. There's a sequel to ''The Devil Wears Prada'' in development at Disney, which will reportedly depict Ms. Priestly managing her magazine's decline in the digital era. To be honest, that doesn't sound like much fun. Ms. Wintour edited the story her own way. Amy Odell is the author of the Back Row newsletter as well as ''Anna: The Biography'' and a forthcoming biography of Gwyneth Paltrow. The Times is committed to publishing a diversity of letters to the editor. We'd like to hear what you think about this or any of our articles. Here are some tips.

First of all, I didn't even know if the order had actually been canceled because I didn't receive any confirmation, and it's impossible to know if I'll get a refund."
UgwEGyBj28FWNC3Zcvt4AaABAg.AJzn8cgttljAK1Ieq7Z24V,2025-07-01 08:57:18,en,YOUTUBE,"  I am waiting for this movie the most because if Akaza's story he's going to be wrapped up here, it's going to be a dream come true I have been silent and patient and now when it's coming out, I am exploding with emotions. Also Douma gate is real but honestly, you may hate him, but because of how good he looks, I think I have fallen under his charm. First of all I have been re-watching the first episode of season three which doesn't help second even in the manga he looks so handsome and so cute as a child but yeah, that is going to change when the second the movie is coming out because no matter how much I adore Douma's design and voice, I love Inosuk's character more. I really cannot wait for Kaigaku to die because I really hate people who are so arrogant and can't take responsibility like Huntengu but I think I also hate Kaigaku's attitude that he is all high and mighty, and he looks down on everyone also let's not forget what he did when he was under the care of Gyomei. Also RIP Shinobu but I am waiting for her fight. I hope it's going to be extended at least a little bit but also I do want the movie mostly to focus on Tanjiro and Giyu vs Akaza. To be fair, I actually had a few dreams that I feel like was in insight into the future of how Infinity castle arc will look like in Versace I have this snippet in my head with how infinity castle has been portrayed in the anime so far where Akaza punches the air where he hears the voice of Koyuki or Keizo I don't remember who it was exactly. If the movie ends after Akaza's fight I will be satisfied. I don't mind also original scenes. I just really can't express how excited I am because in anime infinity castle is huge, which means the places where the characters are going to fight are going to be massive and beautiful I mean, have you seen (of course you have seen) the place where Douma is? Anyway, I'm so excited. I am going to be patient patiently waiting for the end of this year/the beginning of the next year for it to come out on Internet on Crunchyroll because unfortunately, I will not be going to the movies. I have always experienced everything at home."

Dressed in a Versace shirt and gleaming gold chain, Shakur was still out on bond, still basking in the glow of stardom, brushing off a violent altercation with a Crip gang member inside a Sin City casino that had transpired just hours earlier after a Mike Tyson boxing match. Trailing behind Knight and Shakur was the Death Row convoy of about ten cars that snaked through traffic like shadows. Then, at the corner of Flamingo and Koval, beneath the buzz of the Strip's neon haze, a white, late-model Cadillac pulled up alongside. According to Las Vegas prosecutors' July 2024 filings, South Side Compton Crips member Orlando “Baby Lane” Anderson didn't have the correct angle to shoot. This came after a separate court filing in December described him as the alleged shooter. Anderson allegedly handed the semiautomatic .40 Glock to fellow gang member Deandre “Big Dre” Smith, who opened fire from the backseat of the vehicle — 13 shots in total. Four bullets struck Shakur in the chest, arm and thigh. Knight was grazed in the head by shrapnel but survived. Shakur, who had worn a bulletproof vest regularly, was not wearing one that night.

n0qmqlo,2025-07-01 11:17:07,en,REDDIT,"  I've mentioned on Reddit before my tragic story of Versace Eau Fraiche; basically, I spent the longest time trying scents at a chemist for my first deliberate purchase, Versace Pour Homme was by far my favourite, but I got confused and bought Eau Fraiche by mistake. And it turns out I *hate* Eau Fraiche."
mov_3401D53740C9CD809CA648BD35CD6584,2025-07-01 11:20:22,en,WEB,"  In the upper echelons of fashion, luxury isn't simply a fad; it's a way of life. Style, substance and sentiment converge in a finished product that reflects as much on the skill of its creation as on the individual wearing it. In the realm of women's luxury shoes, Versace embodies this notion with fearless design principles, a rich artistic heritage and an inimitable sense of elegance. Women's Luxury Shoes and the Language of Fashion Some say that a woman's shoes are the cornerstone of her style, in both the literal and figurative sense. In the world of luxury fashion, they tell a story all their own, one of social standing, personal agency and unique expression. Whether it's a beautifully designed high heel or an unforgettable boot design, a shoe can strike up a conversation by doing nothing more than simply existing. These aren't items that foster a certain style; they are the style. Aesthetic Meets Artistry The hallmark of luxurious shoes is a powerful blend of visual allure and labour-intensive artistry. Each pair in the collection of women's luxury shoes from Versace is a testament to just that. Sculptural heels, sumptuous textures, the label's signature motifs and a bold exploration of colour abound with every style, and nothing is an afterthought. Superlative materials, including luxe leather and supple suede, paired with polished metal accents, are married to the techniques of practised artisans, ensuring that these shoes deliver comfort in addition to longevity. And more importantly? They're built to be every bit as useful as they are beautiful. Versatility Rooted in Bold Design Perhaps one of the most exciting aspects of the collection of Versace women's luxury shoes is that they're so far from single-use. That says nothing for everything we've seen them prove themselves in the unrelatable environment where they made their first appearance on the runways. Designed for the Modern Woman The luxury consumer of today has evolved. She requires more than beautiful shoes; she needs authenticity, she needs a story, and she needs purpose. The luxury consumer of today is the elegant woman of today. She expects her shoes to be an extension of the strong, sophisticated and stylish way she lives her life.

The quiet power of this look has gone onto shape so many collections to this day—just look at this one in the Row's latest lookbook. I'm certain it will make it into the show, but I worry about execution; the details are so important. Her shirt feels crisp but slightly mussed, wrapped instead of buttoned.

Minis and maxis receive abundant fanfare, but the trusty midi is relatively uncelebrated, doing the hard work of clothing us for summer weddings and work events and everything in-between. Well, until now. This season, the midi dress finally found its way out of everyday rotation and onto the SS25 catwalks, where designers celebrated the calf-grazing style in multiple guises. The summer midi dress – be it figure-skimming and polka dotted or oversized and airy – is finally being given the attention it deserves. Consider a summer dress with an interesting neckline, namely something strapless or asymmetric. Specifically, we can't stop thinking about Versace's slinky, floral bandeau dress, which was styled with metallic chartreuse sling-backs and a mini bag (hello again, Y2K) on the runway. Meanwhile, Dior, Bottega Veneta and Jacquemus all made a case for the one-shoulder LBD. Read Next Speaking of LBDs, there were plenty more – but not as you know them. Enter the Loose Black Dress – a billowing, much more comfortable alternative to its comparatively littler counterpart. See Simone Rocha and Tibi's offerings (which have pockets!) or Khaite's cut-out tunic dress, offering a glimpse of body beneath the swathes of fabric. On and off the runway, the polka-dot dress occupies a prize spot (pun intended). Notable mentions go to the 1990s-inspired, tomato-red, halterneck midi Kaia Gerber wore to the Tribeca Film Festival last month, and the wispy spot-print slip from Charles Jeffrey Loverboy's SS25 collection. A satin slip is also a fine idea, as advocated by Alexa Chung, Dries Van Noten, and an abundance of editors at fashion week. When it comes to summer midi dresses, the choices are plenty. Luckily, we've narrowed it down for you with our curated edit.

mov_7ACFE739BD32A138170AB1D939EE48EE,2025-07-01 15:07:12,en,WEB,"  If your wedding was a global media event, hailed by some as the 'wedding of the century', then how on earth do you follow it? For Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez, now Sanchez-Bezos, the answer is by not going on honeymoon. The couple are currently cruising around the coast of Croatia with their seven children from previous relationships – and have no plans to do anything more organised than that. I'm told: 'They are just hanging out on jetskis and swimming and sunbathing. Its not a honeymoon really, they aren't going away just the two of them. They are relaxing and recovering from the wedding with some family time.' 'Familymoons' – where children come away with their parents – are on the rise as a phenomenon, although after celebrating their love story so visibly it's a surprise that the couple haven't had a more romantic get-away. However a source who was intimately connected with the wedding tells me that family were front and center at the event. For a start, it can be revealed that Sanchez' two sons Evan, 19, and Nikko, 24, were the ones who walked her down the aisle at the wedding on Friday last week in the grounds of the Cini Foundation in San Giorgio Maggiore, just off the Grand Canal in Venice. Nikko is her son by former NFL player Tony Gonzales and Tony and his wife Tobie were among the 200 friends and family at the wedding. Sanchez' daughter Ella, 17, was a maid of honour. Sources say: 'all the kids gave speeches' at the festivities after the wedding ceremony, including Bezos' four children. He had three sons during his marriage to Mackenzie Bezos and they also adopted a daughter. The oldest, Preston, is 25. He's never made public the names of the rest. A source said: 'What people won't know from the pictures is how exhausting and full-on it was for the guests. 'The heat didn't help but people were forever needing to get around Venice, which means by boat, and that was a hassle and took ages, and there were a lot of people who all needed to get to the same place at the same time. 'People were complaining about being completely tired by the time of the wedding day, never mind the day after.' The bar of the Gritti Palace Hotel was the chief hang-out during the three day celebration, with guests like Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom, Sydney Sweeney and Kim and Khloe Kardashian hanging out and partying until the early hours. Jeff Bezos, 61, and Lauren, 55, and their families were quartered at the nearby Aman, and there was an 'overspill' at the St Regis. Lauren had a full on 'glam squad suite' at the Aman for her stylists, hair stylists and make up artists. British singer Ellie Goulding, who was pictured at the event, was actually there to perform after the wedding. The couple also had a gospel choir and it is reported that Matteo Bocelli sang, too. R&B star Usher sang at the 'night after' party on Saturday. Reports that Sir Elton John and Lady Gaga were to perform turned out to be incorrect. The night after party, also called their 'Dolce Notte', was meant to be a pyjama party but many guests interpreted the dress code very liberally. Not least Sanchez-Bezos, who wore a pink Atelier Versace dress with a hand embroidered bodice embellished with crystals and hand pleated skirt. Other guests – so far unreported – include the Netflix boss Ted Sarandos, which might be a surprise as Amazon's Prime Video is a direct rival subscription service to Netflix. Socialite Wendi Deng, formerly married to Rupert Murdoch, was also there. Hollywood power broker Ari Emanuel was there with wife Sarah Staudinger, a fashion designer and friend of the bride. There was some surprise at the invite for Ari, which is being interpreted as a 'slap in the face' for Sanchez' first husband, Patrick Whitesell. Whitesell, who is the father of Evan and Ella, famously has never got on with Emanuel, even though the two men ran WME together for years. Whitesell has since remarried, to model Pia. He and Lauren Sanchez were married for 14 years and announced their separation when her affair with Jeff Bezos became public. The two couples knew each other socially and professionally before the Jeff and Lauren liaison. Jeff Bezos, who founded Amazon, is one of the wealthiest people in the world with a net worth of $244 billion. New wife Lauren is a journalist turned helicopter pilot and she met him when making a documentary. During the wedding she wore a Schiaparelli haute couture dress to an 'eve of' celebration, then a high necked lace Dolce & Gabbana dress for the ceremony. There has been criticism of Jeff Bezos' D&G tux with a Twitter account for Caraceni Sartoria, a leading bespoke tailoring house, writing: 'The most terrible, frightening, horrible tuxedo ever seen in my life. Elegance is not an empty word. I cant stand it! Really suffering.' Guests included Oprah and Gayle King, model Karlie Kloss, former Vogue UK editor Edward Enninful, stylist Jamie Mizrahi, actor Orlando bloom and Kim and Khloe Kardahian, their mother Kris Jenner, and Kylie and Kendall Jenner."

The Amazon founder threw a lavish wedding in Venice, Italy where he virtually rented out the entire city just for his wedding. Photos of the event were published by Vogue, with Bezos' bride, Lauren Sánchez, gracing the cover. Various celebrities were at the shindig, including the Kardashian-Jenner family, who were all in attendance aside from Kourtney. However, it turns out only a few members of the family were originally set to attend, before Kris Jenner took action. Kris Jenner and Kim Kardashian were the only members of the clan originally invited to the wedding, according to a source for Page Six. Reportedly, Sánchez previously had a close relationship with Kardashian and Jenner and allegedly only had a handful of interactions with the other sisters, hence the limited invite. However, it was during the Paris bachelorette party that Kris allegedly made a pitch for the family. The insider told the publication: Originally, the quintet was going to be a duo of just Kim [Kardashian] and Kris, but Mama Kris asked Lauren if she could bring the other three when they were in Paris for the bachelorette party. Wedding planning can be tricky. On one hand, despite the star-studded nature of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez event, the wedding only had a guest list of 200 people. Some many consider that a modest wedding for the average American and, considering an even as high-profile as this one, it's honestly a surprisingly small number of people. It's easy to get the feeling that couple wanted to keep things low-key when it came to the guest list, hence the limited Kardashian-Jenner invite. You may like Nevertheless, Kris Jenner got her wish, as she often does. The ladies looked gorgeous, as Kim Kardashian opted to sport a vintage Versace piece for the event, while sister Khloé rocked a sparkly pink Tamara Ralph Couture gown. Kendall looked ravishing in a black Tom Ford dress, but Kylie was the talk of the town when she wore a controversial Dilara Findikoglu grayish-blue dress for the event, which people argued was a bit too light of a color for a wedding. No matter the occasion, it seems like the Kardashians make a splash wherever they go. The Kardashians weren't alone when it came to high-profile guests. Sydney Sweeney and Brooks Nader were in attendance, along with Tom Brady, Oprah Winfrey and Leonardo DiCaprio, whose wedding date and girlfriend, Vittoria Ceretti, ripped her dress at the event. With such a guest list, it honestly makes sense that all the Kardashians would be there. The famous clan is known for showing up at glamorous events, and the Italian wedding of an American billionaire feels like an event tailor-made for them. When the Kardashian-Jenner family isn't enjoying a multi-million dollar Venetian wedding, one of the things they're doing is filming their reality show, The Kardashians, which is currently available to stream with a Hulu subscription.

A família, segundo uma fonte revelou ao Daily Mail, inclusive foi presença constante durante os três dias de celebração. Para começar, os dois filhos de Sanchez, Evan, de 19 anos, e Nikko, de 24 anos, a levaram ao altar no casamento realizado na sexta-feira (27) passada no terreno da Fundação Cini em San Giorgio Maggiore, próximo ao Grande Canal de Veneza. Já a outra filha de Sanchez, Ella, de 17 anos, foi a dama de honra. Segundo fontes, “todas as crianças fizeram discursos” nas festividades após a cerimônia de casamento, incluindo os quatro filhos de Bezos. Ele teve três filhos durante seu casamento com Mackenzie Bezos e eles também adotaram uma filha. O mais velho, Preston, tem 25 anos. Ele nunca divulgou os nomes dos demais. Mas, nem tudo são flores, ou melhor, são luxos. Uma fonte disse: ""O que as pessoas não saberão pelas fotos é o quanto a cerimônia foi exaustiva e cheia de atividades para os convidados. O calor não ajudou, e as pessoas estavam sempre precisando se locomover em Veneza, ou seja, de barco, o que era um incômodo e demorava muito, e havia muitas pessoas que precisavam chegar ao mesmo lugar ao mesmo tempo. Os convidados reclamavam que estavam completamente cansados no dia do casamento, sem falar no dia seguinte. O bar do Gritti Palace Hotel foi o principal ponto de encontro durante os três dias de comemoração, com convidados como Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom, Sydney Sweeney e Kim e Khloe Kardashian se divertindo e festejando até altas horas da madrugada. A festa da noite seguinte, também chamada de “Dolce Notte”, era para ser uma festa do pijama, mas muitos convidados interpretaram o código de vestimenta de forma muito liberal. Não menos importante, Sanchez-Bezos, que usou um vestido rosa do Atelier Versace com um corpete bordado à mão e adornado com cristais e uma saia plissada à mão. Outros convidados - até agora não relatados - incluem o chefe da Netflix, Ted Sarandos, o que pode ser uma surpresa, já que o Prime Video da Amazon é um serviço de assinatura rival. 'Torta de climão?' O poderoso agente de celebridades Hollywood, Ari Emanuel, também estava presente com sua esposa Sarah Staudinger, designer de moda e amiga da noiva. Houve certa surpresa com o convite para Ari, que está sendo interpretado como um “tapa na cara” do primeiro marido de Sanchez, Patrick Whitesell. Whitesell, que é pai de Evan e Ella, é famoso por nunca ter se dado bem com Emanuel, apesar de os dois terem dirigido a agência de talentos WME juntos durante anos. Desde então, Whitesell se casou novamente com a modelo Pia. Ele e Lauren Sanchez foram casados por 14 anos e anunciaram sua separação quando o caso dela com Jeff se tornou público."

The Italian city, known for is unique canals and historic architecture, felt more like a prop in a play than part of a real-life love story as celebrities draped in designer ensembles carefully teetered into water taxis to sail toward the luxe nuptials of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez Bezos last weekend. Everyone in attendance got the best photos – bride and groom included – but to the outside onlooker something was amiss. The affair, which ended Saturday with its third official day of festivities, is estimated to have cost some $50 million. The depthless expense culminated a deluge of events facing many Americans: The country held its breath and doomscrolled in fear of war with Iran, endured record heat, witnessed charged protests over President Donald Trump's immigration policies, heard major Supreme Court decisions about reproductive health and saw Zohran Mamdani (who said on June 29, ""I don't think we should have billionaires"") win New York City's mayoral Democratic primary. Meanwhile, the city of Venice erupted in protests by locals and activists who saw the Bezos wedding as a sign of garish commodification of a fragile city. And that's a smattering of the news from last week. The atmosphere of whiplash could explain our numbness. When social media timelines showed the world's richest zooming across Venetian waters to the wedding venue on the island of San Giorgio, its lack of substantial meaning or cultural impact is likely why so many hated it. It's OK if you enjoyed gobbling up images of the richest people in the world in their fanciest attire. And we naturally seek fantasy in moments like these, according to culture journalist Louis Pisano (who was blocked on Instagram by Sánchez after posting his impressions about the wedding). But this wedding didn't provide sentimental escapism, he said – it was a chilly reminder there's a billionaire-dollar world we'll never dream of inhabiting. ""It felt extremely exploitative, which turned off any audience from the get-go,"" Pisano says. ""The public had no bandwidth."" The Bezos wedding was an Italian melodrama we've seen before The Italian celebrity wedding is a formula we've already experienced, Pisano says. The wedding heavily sampled Ye (formerly Kanye West) and Kim Kardashian's pan-European nuptials in 2014, which saw Parisian pre-wedding events, a rehearsal dinner in Versailles and a Florence ceremony. The Bezos-Sánchez affair mapped itself along this Kardashian inspiration, mirroring Kim's highly-visible Parisian bachelorette party and featuring a performance at the main event by Mateo Bocelli, son of Andre Bocelli, who famously sang at both Kim and Kanye's and sister Kourtney Kardashian's weddings, Pisano points out. Reference spawns much creativity in the world of fashion and culture (Kim expressed approval of the event, calling it ""magical""). But somehow the Italian drama didn't hit the same tone. While not everyone is a Kardashian-West fan, audiences engaged with their wedding because they feel they knew the bride and groom, Pisano says, from watching the reality star and her family on TV to listening to the rapper's music. ""All of that created this worldbuilding around their wedding and their marriage … to see how far both of them came,"" Pisano says. Their wedding was innovative for 2014, lifting worlds traditionally reserved for magazine pages onto social media. But this time, the parade felt vapid. The event seems to have desperately wanted a spot in the canon of celebrity weddings, says Discoursted newsletter writer Pisano. Fans approved as lifelong bachelor George Clooney finally (and romantically) tied the knot in Venice in 2014 to accomplished lawyer Amal Clooney. Or Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra's multiday party melding ritual with rich visuals. Or, most recently, the billionaire Ambani wedding in India that drew former U.S. officials, celebrities and, of course, Rihanna to its epicenter. They weren't just icing on the wedding cake, but cultural touchpoints realized through marriages. 'It turned my stomach': Rosie O'Donnell blasts Jeff Bezos, Lauren Sánchez's Italy wedding But Bezos and Sánchez's wedding lacked a story to ""root for,"" Pisano says. Rather, the couple invited a 200-person guest list that felt ""random,"" if not transactional, Pisano says, with names like Sydney Sweeney, Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, Ellie Goulding and a solo Orlando Bloom. ""It was all very strategic from everybody's side,"" he says. ""Was it believable that all of these people were such good friends? Absolutely not."" The guest list drew reactions across the internet. ""Does she know them?"" one TikToker mused of Sweeney's invite. Leonardo DiCaprio was called out for attending a ""carbon-intensive billionaire's wedding"" in apparent opposition to the actor's climate activism. Commentator Blakely Thornton even went as far as to call the guests ""confirmed losers"" seeking gratification and status. ""I have a newly found disrespect for all of the celebrities who attended the Bezos wedding,"" one TikToker said. ""Even if you don't think about the politics of it all, it's just an utterly swagless move. Now we all know who's tacky and tasteless."" Bethenny Frankel pokes fun at Jeff Bezos, Lauren Sánchez's wedding invitation And those guests didn't come cheap: The cost of this single affair could cover the cost about 1,515 weddings in the U.S. today. As couples weigh economic uncertainty while planning their own weddings, they couldn't relate. Pisano says the grandeur felt incongruent with current trends favoring smaller, more thoughtful weddings. And then there's the fact the pair waved and blew kisses as they boarded motorboats while protests raged across the city, decrying environmental and antitourist messages to the overcrowded city that is struggling with rising water levels. While the couple donated to local Venetian charities, Pisano says he's skeptical how much impact that holds. ""For one of the richest men in the world, to go to one of the most troubled cities in the world, and contribute to that, doesn't help bring public goodwill toward them,"" he says...."

The depthless expense culminated a deluge of events facing many Americans: The country held its breath and doomscrolled in fear of war with Iran, endured record heat, witnessed charged protests over President Donald Trump's immigration policies, heard major Supreme Court decisions about reproductive health and saw Zohran Mamdani (who said on June 29, ""I don't think we should have billionaires"") win New York City's mayoral Democratic primary. Meanwhile, the city of Venice erupted in protests by locals and activists who saw the Bezos wedding as a sign of garish commodification of a fragile city. And that's a smattering of the news from last week. The atmosphere of whiplash could explain our numbness. When social media timelines showed the world's richest zooming across Venetian waters to the wedding venue on the island of San Giorgio, its lack of substantial meaning or cultural impact is likely why so many hated it. It's OK if you enjoyed gobbling up images of the richest people in the world in their fanciest attire. And we naturally seek fantasy in moments like these, according to culture journalist Louis Pisano (who was blocked on Instagram by Sánchez after posting his impressions about the wedding). But this wedding didn't provide sentimental escapism, he said – it was a chilly reminder there's a billionaire-dollar world we'll never dream of inhabiting. ""It felt extremely exploitative, which turned off any audience from the get-go,"" Pisano says. ""The public had no bandwidth."" The Bezos wedding was an Italian melodrama we've seen before The Italian celebrity wedding is a formula we've already experienced, Pisano says. The wedding heavily sampled Ye (formerly Kanye West) and Kim Kardashian's pan-European nuptials in 2014, which saw Parisian pre-wedding events, a rehearsal dinner in Versailles and a Florence ceremony. The Bezos-Sánchez affair mapped itself along this Kardashian inspiration, mirroring Kim's highly-visible Parisian bachelorette party and featuring a performance at the main event by Mateo Bocelli, son of Andre Bocelli, who famously sang at both Kim and Kanye's and sister Kourtney Kardashian's weddings, Pisano points out. Reference spawns much creativity in the world of fashion and culture (Kim expressed approval of the event, calling it ""magical""). But somehow the Italian drama didn't hit the same tone. While not everyone is a Kardashian-West fan, audiences engaged with their wedding because they feel they knew the bride and groom, Pisano says, from watching the reality star and her family on TV to listening to the rapper's music. ""All of that created this worldbuilding around their wedding and their marriage … to see how far both of them came,"" Pisano says. Their wedding was innovative for 2014, lifting worlds traditionally reserved for magazine pages onto social media. But this time, the parade felt vapid. The event seems to have desperately wanted a spot in the canon of celebrity weddings, says Discoursted newsletter writer Pisano. Fans approved as lifelong bachelor George Clooney finally (and romantically) tied the knot in Venice in 2014 to accomplished lawyer Amal Clooney. Or Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra's multiday party melding ritual with rich visuals. Or, most recently, the billionaire Ambani wedding in India that drew former U.S. officials, celebrities and, of course, Rihanna to its epicenter. They weren't just icing on the wedding cake, but cultural touchpoints realized through marriages. But Bezos and Sánchez's wedding lacked a story to ""root for,"" Pisano says. Rather, the couple invited a 200-person guest list that felt ""random,"" if not transactional, Pisano says, with names like Sydney Sweeney, Oprah Winfrey, Bill Gates, Ellie Goulding and a solo Orlando Bloom. ""It was all very strategic from everybody's side,"" he says. ""Was it believable that all of these people were such good friends? Absolutely not."" The guest list drew reactions across the internet. ""Does she know them?"" one TikToker mused of Sweeney's invite. Leonardo DiCaprio was called out for attending a ""carbon-intensive billionaire's wedding"" in apparent opposition to the actor's climate activism. Commentator Blakely Thornton even went as far as to call the guests ""confirmed losers"" seeking gratification and status. ""I have a newly found disrespect for all of the celebrities who attended the Bezos wedding,"" one TikToker said. ""Even if you don't think about the politics of it all, it's just an utterly swagless move. Now we all know who's tacky and tasteless."" And those guests didn't come cheap: The cost of this single affair could cover the cost about 1,515 weddings in the U.S. today. As couples weigh economic uncertainty while planning their own weddings, they couldn't relate. Pisano says the grandeur felt incongruent with current trends favoring smaller, more thoughtful weddings. And then there's the fact the pair waved and blew kisses as they boarded motorboats while protests raged across the city, decrying environmental and antitourist messages to the overcrowded city that is struggling with rising water levels. While the couple donated to local Venetian charities, Pisano says he's skeptical how much impact that holds. ""For one of the richest men in the world, to go to one of the most troubled cities in the world, and contribute to that, doesn't help bring public goodwill toward them,"" he says.

Y los rumores son ciertos: las piezas de archivo de marcas de lujo como Hermès, Louis Vuitton, Versace, Chanel y Dolce & Gabbana, que tienen a todos los creadores de contenido de moda comentando y especulando, sí son de su propio armario. Pero no hay que dejarse engañar por las apariencias… Mientras la historia de Mentiras de Amazon Prime Video se va desarrollando, hay una línea muy difusa entre las piezas que Belinda prestó de su clóset, y las que quedaron a manos de Claudia Sandoval, la diseñadora de vestuario responsable de recrear la moda de los años 80 que llevan la intérprete de Daniela y los demás personajes de la adaptación del emblemático musical. Pero también ha sido la encargada de crearles una identidad que se refleje a través de la ropa. Y esa no ha sido una tarea fácil. “Hay detrás una investigación súper pesada, aquí estamos los personajes más a fondo. Era una obra de dos horas y ahora son ocho capítulos”, comenta. Esta labor implica cuestionarse todo acerca del personaje, desde quién es, hasta quiénes son sus papás y por qué viste lo que viste. El vestuario de Belinda en Mentiras, la serie “Las pruebas de vestuario eran de horas y horas. Hubo una colaboración, porque ella, como todos los actores, tiene un punto de vista de su personaje”. Y así es como se empatan las necesidades técnicas de la producción, que incluye cómo el vestuario se va a ver en los sets, con la visión que el actor tiene sobre su propio rol. Con Belinda, particularmente, uno de los retos era empatar su agenda con las horas de las pruebas de vestuario, pues al mismo tiempo estaba trabajando en el lanzamiento de su álbum Indómita. “Daniela, si no me equivoco, tiene como 38 cambios en la serie”. Aunque en un giro inesperado y algo inusual, la actriz le abrió las puertas de su clóset a Sandoval, pues sabía que tenía algunas piezas que seguro encajarían con su personaje. “Beli tiene unas prendas como de museo, es increíble”. Entre ellas vimos un abrigo rojo en forma de corazón que Hedi Slimane diseñó para la pasarela ready-to-wear, otoño-invierno 2016, precisamente una colección inspirada en la moda de los 80, además de un bolso de edición limitada de Louis Vuitton, que se distingue por las plumas rosa, y también una camisa y pantalones de Versace que lleva de pijama, sin dejar de mencionar un vestido Blumarine, entre otras icónicas piezas, como su bolsa color rosa palo de Hermès. “Hay muchos momentos muy pequeñitos en donde sale Daniela, donde aparecen muchos de sus cambios, como el flashback del avión y el de la alfombra roja. Y esos momentos eran perfectos para que ella nos ayudara con cosas de su clóset que eran espectaculares”. Luego estaba “el cambio héroe”, el cambio principal que es el que usa en toda la mansión Mijares. “El rosa, ¿no? , el de Chanel”, ingenuamente me atreví a decir. “¡No es Chanel, lo hicimos!” , me responde Claudia. En términos de producción, necesitaban un traje que Belinda pudiera llevar en la escena más larga, la que va sosteniendo el hilo de la historia. Así que tenía que ser un traje reconocible. “El traje Chanel que todos reconocemos, si no es por Jackie Kennedy, es por Marge Simpson”. Un look clásico y perfecto, que fácilmente se podía colar como otra de las piezas más delicadas de Belinda. “Ese tweed lo mandamos a traer de Nueva York, nos mandaron varios, y ese fue el que se terminó quedando una vez que hicimos pruebas de cámara para ver también cómo se veía. Teníamos tres igualitos, que se los íbamos cambiando”. Cuando hablamos de la inspiración de la estética de cuando Daniela era joven, salen a relucir películas como Heather y Clueless cuando se siente un poco más hacia los años 90. Había ropa de los ochenta que era original, pero el reto era llevarlo al universo rosa de Daniela, así que en diseño de vestuario se recrearon a partir de patrones originales de piezas de la época, pero con los colores de Daniela. “Pero también siempre estaba el reto de hacer que tuviera sentido, y de que Daniela no nada más tenía estilo por vestirse de marca. Daniela tenía estilo porque tenía estilo, ¿sabes?” . La diseñadora de vestuario de Mentiras, la serie Claudia Sandoval es la diseñadora de vestuario de Mentiras, la serie de Amazon Prime Video. Su trayectoria comenzó como estudiante de modas en Centro. Al terminar sus estudios, se fue a Nueva York a continuar estudiando y allá comenzó a trabajar en sus primeros proyectos junto a Ana Terrazas, con quien siguió su camino como supervisora de vestuario en películas como Roma de Alfonso Cuarón y Bardo de Alejandro González Iñárritu. A diferencia de las producciones de Hollywood, la profesión de vestuaristas de cine en Latinoamérica ha sido un rol mucho menos mediático. La sensación es que esta labor no ha recibido el reconocimiento que merece. Para Claudia Sandoval, su trabajo comienza por una “investigación del vestuario y de cómo se usaba y por qué se usaba así, y de cómo en México llegaban siempre como un poquito más atrasadas las tendencias, entonces de repente puedes ver algo muy ochentero, pero ya son los noventas”. En Mentiras, Belinda recuperó la moda de los 80, pero cada uno de los personajes también tenían algo que decir. Solo hace falta observar. “Fue muy interesante encontrar otras cosas para darles a los personajes su personalidad, por ejemplo, Yuri siempre trae algo de piel porque ella es muy hermética con sus sentimientos, con sus emociones, y se viste así porque es su segunda piel que la está protegiendo de todo este secreto enorme que se carga; Lupita, cuando llega a la mansión, es la que más capas lleva. Y si ves toda la parte de la mansión, cuando van como sacando los secretos, en cámara se va quitando capas”. Al final, todo es “cómo la ropa habla a través de nosotros, cómo somos una extensión de todo a través de la ropa, y eso usarlo como herramienta para ayudarles a las actrices a meterse a la piel del personaje”.

a63034f9084bfe42fe33157e2bd79a69,2025-07-01 22:41:00,lv,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[lv]Ievads: Mūžīgās elegances triumfs Losandželosā Losandželosas koši sarkanā paklāja spožums reti kad atklāj patiesu modes revolūciju, tomēr aktrisei Umai Tūrmanei (Uma Thurman) tas izdevās ar pārsteidzošu vienkāršību un dziļu nozīmi. Filmas “The Old Guard 2” pirmizrādē, kas notika nesen, 2025. gada 25. jūnijā, Tūrmane neizvēlējās jaunu, tikko no podiuma nākušu tērpu, bet gan uzvilka teju trīs desmitgades vecu Prada kleitu no zīmola 1997. gada pavasara kolekcijas. Šī izvēle nebija tikai modes paziņojums; tā bija klusa, tomēr spēcīga manifestācija par mūžīgu stilu, ilgtspējību un personīgo identitāti, kas nepakļaujas ātrās modes mainīgajām vīzijām. Vēstījums sarkanajam paklājam: 28 gadus veca kleita ar jaunu elpu Kamēr citi vadošie aktieri, piemēram, Šarlīze Terona (Charlize Theron) un Kiki Leina (Kiki Layne), “The Old Guard 2” pirmizrādē demonstrēja mūsdienīgus dizaineru tērpus, Uma Tūrmane izcēlās ar savu pārdomāto un nostalģisko izvēli. Viņas tērps, kas sastāvēja no mandarīnu apkaklītes augšdaļas un zīda A veida svārkiem ar izsmalcinātu chinoiserie lapu žakarda motīvu, ne tikai piesaistīja uzmanību, bet arī iedarbināja plašāku diskusiju par modes vērtībām un patiesu eleganci. Lai gan daži interneta komentētāji sākumā apšaubīja tērpa piegulšanu vai krāsu, lielākā daļa vienojās, ka tas izstaro klasisku Umas Tūrmanes šarmu – līdzsvaru starp izsmalcinātību un relaksāciju, kas raksturīgs viņas stilam. Šī Prada kleita, precīzāk, tās iedvesma no 1997. gada pavasara kolekcijas, ir vairāk nekā tikai auduma gabals; tā ir gabals no modes vēstures, kas atdzīvināts jaunā kontekstā. Tā runā par apģērbu kā investīciju, nevis īslaicīgu kaprīzi, un apstiprina, ka patiesais stils ir nepakļāvīgs laika zobs. Aktrises izvēle vēl jo vairāk izceļas pašreizējā strauji mainīgajā modes ainā, kur katra jauna sezona atnes tūkstošiem jaunu tendenču un tērpu, radot milzīgu vides slogu. Tūrmanes rīcība ir kā svaiga gaisa malks, kas aicina apstāties un novērtēt to, kas jau pastāv un ir izturējis laika pārbaudi. Prada 1997. gada pavasara kolekcija: Miučijas Pradas sapnis un vīzija Lai pilnībā novērtētu Umas Tūrmanes izvēles nozīmi, ir jāiedziļinās Miučijas Pradas (Miuccia Prada) daiļrades kontekstā 1997. gadā. Toreizējā Prada pavasara/vasaras kolekcija bija iezīmēta ar izteiktu romantismu un sapņainību, atšķiroties no zīmola agrākajām, bieži vien stingrākajām neilona siluetēm. Šī kolekcija piedāvāja plandošas, caurspīdīgas kleitas ar delikātiem augu motīviem, kas apvienoja smalkumu un minimālismu ar smalku estētiku. Miučija Prada meklēja jaunu sievišķības izpausmi, attālinoties no tolaik valdošās ""modei neglītais"" tendences un pievēršoties kaut kam ēteriskākam un trauslākam. Kolekcijas raksturīgās iezīmes bija tieši šie chinoiserie motīvi – smalki zīda audumi, uz kuriem vijās izšuvumi vai apdrukas ar Āzijas iedvesmotiem lapu vai ziedu rakstiem. Šī estētika toreiz bija drosmīgs solis, jo Pradas reputācija balstījās uz intelektuālu, bieži vien askētisku pieeju, kas neizcēlās ar acīmredzamu glamūru. Taču tieši šajā kontrastā slēpās tās ģenialitāte: Miučija Prada spēja apvienot tradicionālo ar moderno, radot tērpus, kas bija vienlaikus gan eleganti, gan nedaudz neparasti. Umas Tūrmanes izvēlētā kleita, kas atspoguļo šīs kolekcijas dvēseli, bija un joprojām ir apliecinājums Pradas spējai radīt apģērbu, kas pārsniedz sezonālas tendences un kļūst par daļu no modes kanona. Umas Tūrmanes stils: Nepakļaušanās un pāri laika robežām Uma Tūrmane jau gadu desmitiem ir pazīstama ar savu izsmalcināto un bieži vien neparasto stila izjūtu. Viņa nekad nav bijusi akli sekojoša tendencēm, drīzāk radot savu, atpazīstamu elegances zīmolu. Viņas ilgstošās attiecības ar Prada modes namu sākās jau 90. gados, kad 1995. gada Oskara balvu ceremonijā viņa parādījās purpura Prada kleitā, nostiprinot savu statusu kā stila ikona. Tajā laikā Prada vēl nebija tik plaši atpazīstama kā šodien, un Tūrmanes izvēle bija drosmīga un negaidīta, iezīmējot zīmola ceļu uz starptautisku slavu un apliecinot aktrises izpratni par jaunām vīzijām modē. Gadu gaitā Tūrmane ir pierādījusi savu stilistisko daudzveidību, bez piepūles pārejot no romantiskām balles kleitām uz šikiem, piegrieztiem kostīmiem. Viņa izvēlas Eiropas dizainerus, piemēram, Versace un Dior, taču vienmēr saglabā savu unikālo identitāti. Viņas jaunākā izvēle – Prada kleita no 1997. gada – nav nejauša. Tā ir dziļi apzināta vēlme apliecināt vērtību laikam, meistarībai un stila ilgmūžībai. Tūrmane, kas pati ir kino ikona, ar savu tērpu it kā saka, ka patiesā vērtība slēpjas nevis jaunos apģērbos, bet gan spējā atdzīvināt un novērtēt to, kas jau ir sevi pierādījis kā izcilu. Vintage modes pieaugums: Aicinājums uz apzinātu patēriņu Umas Tūrmanes izvēle atspoguļo plašāku un arvien pieaugošu tendenci modes pasaulē: vintage apģērbu popularitāti uz sarkanā paklāja. Šī tendence, ko veicina tādi stilisti kā Lau Ročs (Law Roach) un tādas zvaigznes kā Zendaja (Zendaya) un Kendala Dženere (Kendall Jenner), ir kļuvusi par veidu, kā izcelties un paust nostāju. Tas nav tikai jauns modes kliedziens; tas ir daudzslāņains fenomens, ko virza vairāki būtiski faktori. Pirmkārt, tā ir alkas pēc individualitātes un unikalitātes. Ātrās modes laikmetā, kurā tūkstošiem cilvēku valkā līdzīgus apģērbus no masveida ražošanas, vintage piedāvā iespēju atrast patiesi oriģinālus, bieži vien ar rokām darinātus vai ierobežotās tirāžās radītus gabalus. Tie stāsta savu stāstu, nes sevī pagātnes atbalsis un ļauj to valkātājam justies īpašam. Otrkārt, tas ir spēcīgs solis ilgtspējības virzienā. Modes industrija ir viena no lielākajām piesārņotājām pasaulē, kas patērē milzīgus ūdens un enerģijas resursus, kā arī rada milzīgu atkritumu daudzumu. Izvēloties vintage, slavenības sūta skaidru vēstījumu par apzinātu patēriņu un resursu saglabāšanu. Tā ir atbilde uz augošo vides apziņu un vēlmi samazināt modes ekoloģisko pēdu. Atkārtoti izmantojot un novērtējot jau radīto, mēs veicinām aprites ekonomiku un samazinām pieprasījumu pēc jauniem, bieži vien neētiskos apstākļos ražotiem apģērbiem. Treškārt, vintage ir saistīts ar nostalģiju un vēstures novērtējumu. Šīs drēbes nav vienkārši “vecas”; tās ir archīva pērles, kas atspoguļo konkrētus periodus modes dizainā, kultūrā un sabiedrībā. Valkājot tās, slavenības ne tikai godina pagātnes dizainerus un meistarību, bet arī veido tiltu starp dažādiem modes laikmetiem, pierādot, ka patiesais skaistums ir pārejošs. Modes ietekme un zvaigžņu atbildība Zvaigžņu izvēlēm uz sarkanā paklāja ir milzīga ietekme uz globālajām modes tendencēm un patērētāju uzvedību. Kad tāda ikona kā Uma Tūrmane izvēlas vintage, tas nav tikai individuāls lēmums; tas ir publisks paziņojums, kas iedvesmo miljoniem cilvēku. Tas liek aizdomāties par ātrās modes ēnas pusēm – par tās ietekmi uz vidi, par strādnieku tiesībām, par pārmērīgu patēriņu...."

mov_3273FFCBAD52C5C16A16D92BB7D5A8B7,2025-07-02 06:23:06,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Fueron tres fabulosos días de fiesta en los que los novios celebraron junto a 250 invitados, entre los que estaban la reina de Jordania, estrellas de Hollywood y algunas de las figuras más influyentes del mundo Tres días a puro lujo, misterio y… millones de dólares. Así se vivió la fastuosa boda de Jeff Bezos (61) y Lauren Sánchez (55), celebrada en Venecia. El casamiento acaparó la atención no sólo por su “A-list” de invitados –la reina Rania de Jordania, Bill Gates, Ivanka Trump, Leonardo DiCaprio, las Kardashian, entre otros, dijeron presente–, sino también por la espectacularidad de su puesta en escena: looks de alta costura, locaciones imponentes y un despliegue de aviones privados, helicópteros y lanchas cinco estrellas que coparon la Ciudad de los Canales durante todo el fin de semana. A puertas cerradas y con una reserva absoluta (el acceso a la isla fue restringido y los celulares estuvieron prohibidos), la ceremonia tuvo lugar en la Basílica de San Giorgio Maggiore (en la isla homónima). Si bien la organización de la “boda blindada” aún mantiene bajo llave los secretos mejor guardados de los festejos (como el presupuesto que, según Forbes y The New York Times, se estimó entre un mínimo de 10 millones y un máximo de 20 millones de dólares), fue imposible que no se filtraran jugosos detalles del megaevento. El fundador de Amazon y la periodista llegaron el miércoles 25 y se hospedaron en el hotel Aman –el mismo que eligieron George Clooney y Amal Alamuddin para su casamiento en 2014–. Al día siguiente, dieron una comida de bienvenida en los claustros de la iglesia Madonna dell'Orto, en el distrito de Cannaregio. Para los movimientos, un convoy de treinta embarcaciones ya había sido reservado por Bezos para trasladar a sus invitados. El magnate –cuya fortuna asciende a 215.000 millones de dólares según Forbes y que lo ubica en el tercer puesto entre los hombres más ricos del mundo– pensó un menú que incluía pizza artesanal, flores de calabacín fritas, pulpo y bacalao, y tartas de limón como postre. La reina Rania (llegó escoltada por su hijo, el príncipe heredero Hussein; su nuera, la princesa Rajwa; y su nieta, Iman, de 10 meses), Kim y Khloé Kardashian, Kendall y Kylie Jenner, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Brady, Usher, Orlando Bloom –recién separado de Katy Perry– y la actriz del momento, Sydney Sweeney, acompañaron a los novios en la víspera de su boda. Para la ocasión, Lauren eligió un diseño de Schiaparelli de la colección couture primavera-verano 2025: escote off shoulder, corset entallado y flores bordadas con hilos de oro. Fue el primer vestido de los 27 que luciría la novia durante su inolvidable estadía en Venecia. Inspirada en el traje de boda que usó Sophia Loren en la película Houseboat de 1958, Lauren caminó hacia el altar enfundada en una fabulosa pieza de Dolce & Gabbana. El modelo, de corte sirena y mangas largas, incluyó encaje chantilly italiano, 180 botones de seda forrados, un velo de tul y cola. “Investigué fotos de novias en la década de 1950. Quería recordar el pasado y vi a Sophia Loren y sus manos estaban así –en posición de oración– y llevaba un vestido de encaje alto hasta el cuello, y dije: 'Eso es. Ese es el vestido'”, dijo la ganadora del Emmy en una entrevista exclusiva que dio a Vogue, donde compartió además el impacto de Bezos en su vida. “Jeff no me cambió. Jeff me reveló. Me siento segura. Me siento vista. Me deja ser yo misma. Como Sophia Loren, que es libre sin complejos, él me deja ser libre sin complejos”, declaró. Lauren, que completó su look con unos impresionantes pendientes prestados por Dolce & Gabbana Alta Gioielleria Miracolo, con cuatro diamantes tallados en una sola piedra e incrustaciones de oro blanco. Bezos, por su parte, lució un smoking negro confeccionado a medida por la misma casa italiana, moño y anteojos de sol Louis Vuitton. La periodista llegó con sus hijos, Nikko González (24) –nacido de su relación con Tony González– y Evan Whitesell (22) – hijo de su anterior matrimonio con el empresario Patrick Whitesell–. Su hija, Ella Whitesell (17), fue la dama de honor. Si bien no hay mucho detalle sobre el momento del “sí, quiero” de los novios, la revista Vanity Fair señaló que Matteo Boce - lli –hijo del italiano Andrea Bocelli– cantó el clásico de Elvis Can't Help Falling in Love . Y SIGUE LA FIESTA Al día siguiente, los recién casados disfrutaron de un almuerzo con sus íntimos en Harry's Bar, el icónico bar de Cipriani. Al caer el sol, los esperaba la “Dolce Notte”, la gran fiesta de boda organizada en el Arsenale, unos antiguos astilleros del siglo XIV. El evento originalmente había sido planificado para realizarse en la Scuola Grande della Misericordia, un edificio histórico situado en pleno centro de Venecia. Sin embargo, debido a las protestas de los locales y los riesgos de seguridad para los invitados, se decidió hacerla en un lugar más aislado, con acceso controlado. Allí, el flamante matrimonio coronó el enlace con una fiesta temática de pijamas. “Querían que la celebración continuara, pero de una forma más íntima y divertida… Lauren pensó que sería encantador que todos se pusieran cómodos y terminaran el casamiento en un ambiente relajado”, dijo una fuente a la revista People y agregó: “Fue genial. Duró hasta las cuatro de la mañana. Los invitados vestían seda, batas y pantuflas. Fue épico. Un auténtico baile, con todos subidos a los bancos, sofás y sillones” La novia optó esa vez por un modelo romántico en tono rosa viejo con aplicaciones de brillo de Atelier Versace que es obra de Donatella. Se trata de un strapless de corte sirena con falda fruncida,y bustier con cristales Swarovski, que la novia combinó con una robe de chambre, perfecta para el código de vestir de la fiesta. Si bien los rumores indicaban que Elton John y Lady Gaga cantarían en vivo, nada de esto se pudo confirmar. Según el portal de noticias TMZ, el empresario tecnológico habría desistido de la idea luego de que los músicos pidieran un cachet de seis millones de dólares cada uno. La fiesta fue musicalizada por DJ Cassidy, que también había tocado en la boda de Beyoncé y Jay-Z. El casamiento de Mr. y Mrs. Bezos marcó un antes y un después en la historia de la ciudad italiana...."

Así se vivió la fastuosa boda de Jeff Bezos (61) y Lauren Sánchez (55), celebrada en Venecia. El casamiento acaparó la atención no sólo por su “A-list” de invitados –la reina Rania de Jordania, Bill Gates, Ivanka Trump, Leonardo DiCaprio, las Kardashian, entre otros, dijeron presente–, sino también por la espectacularidad de su puesta en escena: looks de alta costura, locaciones imponentes y un despliegue de aviones privados, helicópteros y lanchas cinco estrellas que coparon la Ciudad de los Canales durante todo el fin de semana. A puertas cerradas y con una reserva absoluta (el acceso a la isla fue restringido y los celulares estuvieron prohibidos), la ceremonia tuvo lugar en la Basílica de San Giorgio Maggiore (en la isla homónima). Si bien la organización de la “boda blindada” aún mantiene bajo llave los secretos mejor guardados de los festejos (como el presupuesto que, según Forbes y The New York Times, se estimó entre un mínimo de 10 millones y un máximo de 20 millones de dólares), fue imposible que no se filtraran jugosos detalles del megaevento. El fundador de Amazon y la periodista llegaron el miércoles 25 y se hospedaron en el hotel Aman –el mismo que eligieron George Clooney y Amal Alamuddin para su casamiento en 2014–. Al día siguiente, dieron una comida de bienvenida en los claustros de la iglesia Madonna dell'Orto, en el distrito de Cannaregio. Para los movimientos, un convoy de treinta embarcaciones ya había sido reservado por Bezos para trasladar a sus invitados. El magnate –cuya fortuna asciende a 215.000 millones de dólares según Forbes y que lo ubica en el tercer puesto entre los hombres más ricos del mundo– pensó un menú que incluía pizza artesanal, flores de calabacín fritas, pulpo y bacalao, y tartas de limón como postre. La reina Rania (llegó escoltada por su hijo, el príncipe heredero Hussein; su nuera, la princesa Rajwa; y su nieta, Iman, de 10 meses), Kim y Khloé Kardashian, Kendall y Kylie Jenner, Oprah Winfrey, Tom Brady, Usher, Orlando Bloom –recién separado de Katy Perry– y la actriz del momento, Sydney Sweeney, acompañaron a los novios en la víspera de su boda. Para la ocasión, Lauren eligió un diseño de Schiaparelli de la colección couture primavera-verano 2025: escote off shoulder, corset entallado y flores bordadas con hilos de oro. Fue el primer vestido de los 27 que luciría la novia durante su inolvidable estadía en Venecia. EL GRAN DÍA Inspirada en el traje de boda que usó Sophia Loren en la película Houseboat de 1958, Lauren caminó hacia el altar enfundada en una fabulosa pieza de Dolce & Gabbana. El modelo, de corte sirena y mangas largas, incluyó encaje chantilly italiano, 180 botones de seda forrados, un velo de tul y cola. “Investigué fotos de novias en la década de 1950. Quería recordar el pasado y vi a Sophia Loren y sus manos estaban así –en posición de oración– y llevaba un vestido de encaje alto hasta el cuello, y dije: 'Eso es. Ese es el vestido'”, dijo la ganadora del Emmy en una entrevista exclusiva que dio a Vogue, donde compartió además el impacto de Bezos en su vida. “Jeff no me cambió. Jeff me reveló. Me siento segura. Me siento vista. Me deja ser yo misma. Como Sophia Loren, que es libre sin complejos, él me deja ser libre sin complejos”, declaró. Lauren, que completó su look con unos impresionantes pendientes prestados por Dolce & Gabbana Alta Gioielleria Miracolo, con cuatro diamantes tallados en una sola piedra e incrustaciones de oro blanco. Bezos, por su parte, lució un smoking negro confeccionado a medida por la misma casa italiana, moño y anteojos de sol Louis Vuitton. La periodista llegó con sus hijos, Nikko González (24) –nacido de su relación con Tony González– y Evan Whitesell (22) – hijo de su anterior matrimonio con el empresario Patrick Whitesell–. Su hija, Ella Whitesell (17), fue la dama de honor. Si bien no hay mucho detalle sobre el momento del “sí, quiero” de los novios, la revista Vanity Fair señaló que Matteo Boce - lli –hijo del italiano Andrea Bocelli– cantó el clásico de Elvis Can't Help Falling in Love . Y SIGUE LA FIESTA Al día siguiente, los recién casados disfrutaron de un almuerzo con sus íntimos en Harry's Bar, el icónico bar de Cipriani. Al caer el sol, los esperaba la “Dolce Notte”, la gran fiesta de boda organizada en el Arsenale, unos antiguos astilleros del siglo XIV. El evento originalmente había sido planificado para realizarse en la Scuola Grande della Misericordia, un edificio histórico situado en pleno centro de Venecia. Sin embargo, debido a las protestas de los locales y los riesgos de seguridad para los invitados, se decidió hacerla en un lugar más aislado, con acceso controlado. Allí, el flamante matrimonio coronó el enlace con una fiesta temática de pijamas. “Querían que la celebración continuara, pero de una forma más íntima y divertida… Lauren pensó que sería encantador que todos se pusieran cómodos y terminaran el casamiento en un ambiente relajado”, dijo una fuente a la revista People y agregó: “Fue genial. Duró hasta las cuatro de la mañana. Los invitados vestían seda, batas y pantuflas. Fue épico. Un auténtico baile, con todos subidos a los bancos, sofás y sillones” La novia optó esa vez por un modelo romántico en tono rosa viejo con aplicaciones de brillo de Atelier Versace que es obra de Donatella. Se trata de un strapless de corte sirena con falda fruncida,y bustier con cristales Swarovski, que la novia combinó con una robe de chambre, perfecta para el código de vestir de la fiesta. Si bien los rumores indicaban que Elton John y Lady Gaga cantarían en vivo, nada de esto se pudo confirmar. Según el portal de noticias TMZ, el empresario tecnológico habría desistido de la idea luego de que los músicos pidieran un cachet de seis millones de dólares cada uno. La fiesta fue musicalizada por DJ Cassidy, que también había tocado en la boda de Beyoncé y Jay-Z. LOS NÚMEROS El casamiento de Mr. y Mrs. Bezos marcó un antes y un después en la historia de la ciudad italiana. “Venecia una vez más se revela como un escenario global”, dijo entusiasmado el alcalde Luigi Brugnaro a The Associated Press. Y no es para menos: según el Ministerio de Turismo italiano, el enlace podría generar un impacto económico de aproximadamente 1100 millones de dólares, casi el 68 por ciento de lo que la ciudad suele recaudar en un año completo por turismo...."

In early May, renowned Chef Alfonso Iaccarino visited Macau to present exclusive new menus at his two restaurants, Casa Don Alfonso at Grand Lisboa Hotel and Don Alfonso 1890 at Palazzo Versace at Grand Lisboa Palace in Cotai. As we talk, the 78-year-old recalls the stories of his colourful life, the rich testimonies typical of someone who grew up in the world of hospitality and discovered from an early age what he describes as his 'mission' in life, rather than just a profession. The three generations that preceded him dedicated themselves to hospitality and spread the Iaccarino surname from their humble origins in Sant'Agata de' Goti, in the Campania region, to the rest of Italy and, finally, the world. Alfonso and his wife Livia decided to take a different path and turn their lives into a love letter to the Mediterranean diet with their home restaurant Don Alfonso 1890, planted on the Amalfi coast. The first location was followed by other venues with the same name around the world, in locations as far apart as Canada, Portugal and Macau – still the only representation of the family in Asia.

Tra yacht, gondole e abiti d'alta moda, le nozze del patron di Amazon e della giornalista-pilota hanno monopolizzato l'attenzione mondiale. Ma mentre i riflettori hanno immortalato sorrisi e sfarzo, dietro le quinte non tutto è filato liscio. Powered by Chi c'era lo racconta sottovoce: l'organizzazione impeccabile era anche estenuante. Gli ospiti – una lista che sembrava uscita direttamente da un after party degli Oscar – sono stati costretti a continui spostamenti in barca tra una location e l'altra, con orari rigidi e poca flessibilità. A peggiorare la situazione, il caldo torrido che ha reso l'esperienza meno da sogno e più da maratona. Non era una cerimonia, ma una vera e propria full immersion di tre giorni tra eventi, cene di gala e abiti da gran sera. E qualcuno, alla fine, ha iniziato a contare i minuti per tornare alla routine. Il pigiama party senza pigiami Clou delle celebrazioni: il party “Dolce Notte”, una festa in stile pigiama con dress code preciso. O almeno, così era sulla carta. Perché in realtà nessuno – nemmeno la sposa – ha rispettato il tema. Lauren Sanchez ha scelto un lungo abito rosa ricamato firmato Versace, ben lontano dal mood “slumber party”. Kim Kardashian ha sfoggiato un maxi dress con scollatura vertiginosa e autoreggenti a vista, mentre Vittoria Ceretti ha optato per un raffinato slip dress di seta, elegante e poco notturno. Più che una serata informale tra amici, sembrava un red carpet a tema “glam estremo”. Tutto perfetto, tutto dorato. Ma basta grattare via un po' di glitter per trovare il dietro le quinte: imprevisti, stress e abiti inadatti al contesto. Nessuno scandalo, certo, ma nemmeno la perfezione assoluta che ci si aspetta da un matrimonio da centinaia di milioni."

mov_CF0693196A8E3535CE5CDE72CF76FD98,2025-07-02 12:05:04,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Hace apenas cuatro días, Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sánchez sellaron su “sí, quiero” con un festín de tres días que ha dejado a la Serenísima patas arriba. Entre góndolas requisadas, protestas ciudadanas y un presupuesto que ronda los 50 millones de euros, la pareja más poderosa del momento acaba de firmar el bodorrio de 2025. Convertidos en una de las parejas más influyentes de la alta sociedad internacional, Jeff Bezos, fundador de Amazon, y Lauren Sánchez, periodista, piloto de helicópteros y autora, acaban de sellar su historia de amor con una de las bodas más mediáticas del año. Tras cinco años de relación y dos de compromiso, el enlace se celebró entre el 26 y el 28 de junio, y fue una de las fiestas más grandes que vamos a presenciar este 2025. Poder, lujo, celebrities de todo el mundo, glamour y polémica ¡esta boda lo ha tenido todo! Por fin, tras meses de expectación y rumores, podemos contaros todos los detalles del enlace. Os adelantamos que ha sido una boda con un nivel de exclusividad y una influencia brutales. Una novia de lujo Para la ceremonia simbólica del 28 de junio, Lauren apareció enfundada en un Dolce & Gabbana de encaje (180 botones cosidos a mano y cola de dos metros) inspirado en el vestido que Sophia Loren lució en Houseboat (1958). “Una poesía portátil”, confesó la propia novia. Pero ahí no terminó el desfile: en total, 27 outfits distintos desfilaron sobre sus curvas durante el fin de semana, coronados por un Versace rosa empolvado en la fiesta “Dolce Notte”. Escenario flotante Los rumores iniciales situaban el evento en algún rincón exclusivo de Colorado, tal vez una cumbre entre montañas o un retiro alpino de lujo. Pero Jeff Bezos sorprendió a todos con un rotundo arrivederci a las Rocosas y puso rumbo a la Serenísima. El magnate cambió las alturas por las aguas, y convirtió la laguna veneciana en el epicentro de su celebración más íntima y grandiosa. Su yate Koru, una joya náutica de 127 metros de eslora, valorada en más de 500 millones de euros y coronada en la proa con una escultura de Lauren Sánchez, ejerció de residencia flotante y centro de operaciones. Cuando se puede, se puede. La ceremonia tuvo lugar en la isla de San Giorgio Maggiore, frente a la Plaza de San Marcos. Más tarde, los invitados embarcaron hacia los históricos astilleros del Arsenale de Venecia, transformados por una noche en escenario de una cena de gala que mezcló tradición marítima, arte contemporáneo y lujo sin contención. Una boda pensada al milímetro, flotando entre historia, arte y espectáculo. Invitados VIP… y vecinos en pie de guerra La alfombra (in)visible que cubrió los canales de Venecia durante aquel fin de semana fue tan deslumbrante como controvertida. Una constelación de estrellas descendió sobre la laguna: Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, Lady Gaga, el omnipresente clan Kardashian, Rania de Jordania con su habitual elegancia, y un reflexivo Bill Gates, que aprovechó su estancia para una visita privada al Hombre de Vitruvio de Leonardo da Vinci, normalmente oculto a la vista pública. En total, más de 90 jets privados aterrizaron en los aeropuertos cercanos, desbordando el tráfico aéreo y dejando una estela de lujo y queroseno. Los hoteles más emblemáticos de la ciudad como el Gritti Palace, el legendario Cipriani, el minimalista y exclusivo Aman Canal Grande se convirtieron en los refugios donde se alojaron celebridades, magnates y miembros de casas reales. El colectivo #NoSpaceForBezos, formado por residentes, activistas y defensores del patrimonio veneciano, salió al paso del despliegue con pancartas, protestas y la amenaza de bloquear los canales con pequeñas embarcaciones. Denuncian la creciente “apropiación de la ciudad por los ultrarricos”, el encarecimiento de la vida local, y la conversión de Venecia en un parque temático exclusivo para élites globales. Las redes sociales se llenaron de imágenes que contrastaban el brillo de los trajes de gala con las camisetas reivindicativas ondeando en el viento. “Queremos impedir que lleguen a la iglesia. Esta es una batalla por la dignidad de la ciudad”, declaraba en las vísperas del evento Alice Bazzoli, portavoz de una de las plataformas convocantes. Pero, por supuesto, nada iba a turbar la boda del millonario y su ya esposa. Venecia vivió, literalmente, entre lentejuela y manifestación, en una puesta en escena que, sin pretenderlo, resumió como pocas veces la tensión entre el espectáculo del poder y la fragilidad de las ciudades habitadas. Banquete con estrellas Michelin El tres estrellas Fabrizio Mellino firmó un menú a la altura  rematado por una tarta de Cédric Grolet. Si se puede tener a los mejores ¿por qué cortarse? Imagina estar sentada entre todos los VIPs y comer la mejor pasta al limón que has comido en tu vida y coronar la comida con un postre de uno de los mejores reposteros y más virales del momento ¡soñar es gratis! Matteo Bocelli puso banda sonora con Can't Help Falling in Love, y al caer la medianoche Elton John y Lady Gaga tomaron el relevo y regalaron a la pareja un momentazo. [embedded content] Y si pensabas que la exuberancia había tocado techo, Bezos añadió helados artesanales para los paparazzi. ¿Exceso o nueva era del lujo? Entre protestas, drones antiespía y ex marines custodiando canales, la boda dejó claro que la discreción no estaba en el guion. ¿El resultado? Un manual de estilo imposible para el 99,9 % del planeta: lujo desorbitado, estética futurista y ecos vintage. Porque sí, soñar con una boda así es gratis. Pero ejecutar el plan requiere ser (literalmente) el hombre más rico del mundo. Aun así, si algo se puede rescatar es la fórmula Bezos: trabaja duro, pásalo bien y hazlo a lo grande (muy, muy a lo grande). Claudia estudió Periodismo en la Universidad de Sevilla. Cree que el amor es una de las fuerzas más poderosas y disfruta contando historias que emocionan. En LSC ha encontrado el espacio ideal para combinar su pasión por la escritura con su interés por las bodas."

At least scouting out a dognapper gives Sonny a chance to get to know her new neighbors. Forty-eight hours in town and Figgy's disappearance entangles Sonny in an unwelcome reunion with her ex, one of Haven's wealthiest citizens. And when the body of a teenage boy is found along a popular hiking trail, Sonny is drawn into a web of strange beyond anything she ever saw in LA. Then comes a local's warning: question everything.

mov_A63A5B8EE12D41866139A0E2BA9A9BCE,2025-07-02 12:30:59,ja,WEB,  SPR_COMBO[ja]場所はミラノ郊外にある18世紀に建てられたレンガ造りの邸宅。 結婚式を目前にしたローレン・サンチェスは、手縫いのアップリケが施されたイタリアンレースのウエディングドレスに身を包んでいた。 「涙が出そうです！ 当日は（涙で）ぐしゃぐしゃになるだろうけど、それは最高のぐしゃぐしゃですね」と彼女は言う。 この日はUS版『VOGUE』の撮影日。 この前日、サンチェスとベゾスはミラノ中心部にあるドルチェ＆ガッバーナ（DOLCE&GABBANA）のアトリエで最終フィッティングを行った。 数週間後には、ここから300キロ近く離れたヴェネツィアで、200人ほどの家族や友人を招いた結婚式を控えている。 フィッティングを振り返りながら、「想像以上にパワフルでした」とサンチェス。 ベゾスにはドレス姿をひと目見たいと懇願されたが、当日までのお楽しみにすることにしたそうだ。 「もう少しで屈服するところでしたよ！ でも、サプライズにしたかったんです。 多少歳を重ねると、そう並大抵のことでは驚かなくなるから。 当日、彼の反応を見るのが楽しみで仕方ありません」 ポプラ並木を背景に美しいマーメイドラインを描くガウンを纏った彼女は、腰に手を当ててポーズをとった。 「プリンセスになった気分」と彼女が言うと、「本当にプリンセスみたいですよ！」と、周囲にいたメイクアップチームやシームストレス、プロダクションチームが口を揃える。 ドルチェ＆ガッバーナのテーラーたちは、黒のかぎ針編みのピーターパンカラーとグログランリボンのベルトをつけた真っ白な作業服に身を包み、外科医のような正確さでチュールとレースのヴェールを広げていく。 すると、一匹の羽アリが繊細な布地に引っかかった。 イタリア語が慌ただしく飛び交ったかと思うと、その羽アリはすぐにそっと慎重に取り除かれた。 次に、ヴェールが王冠のようにサンチェスの頭に被せられる。 スクーターに乗った誰かが敷地の境界線を通り過ぎると、一瞬のパニックが起こった。 というのも、パパラッチに見つからないようにとこの場所を選んでいたからだ。 「GoPro（カメラ）は装着していなかった」と、イタリアの撮影プロデューサーは皆に断言する。 どうやら、隣地へと向かうトウモロコシ農家の人だったようだ。 厳重な警備の下で行われたフィッティング ベゾスとサンチェスの結婚は世界中でも大きな注目を集め、大手メディアは現地取材を行っている。 タブロイド紙は、サンチェスがパリで開いた独身最後の贅沢なパーティーを含め、結婚式に関するすべてを細かく取り上げた。 ふたりの結婚は何かと物議を醸し、ヴェネツィアではベゾスの富と、この式に対して抗議活動が展開されたほどだ。 とはいえ、「結婚式は極めて親密なもの」とサンチェスは主張し、200人の招待客のうち70人ほどは親族だと付け加える。 ミラノにいるステファノ・ガッバーナも、電話越しに「彼女はとてもクラシックでエレガントな結婚式を挙げたがっています。 あまり派手なことは望んでいません」と擁護した。 ベゾスとサンチェスにとってこれは2度目の結婚で、ベゾスには4人、サンチェスには3人の連れ子がいる。 有名な話だが、ふたりが婚約したのは2023年5月、3本のマストがある全長約130メートルもの豪華なヨットの上だった。 そのヨットの名は「コル」。 「新生」を意味するマオリの言葉だ。 サンチェスは、このコル号での滞在中に枕元で見つけたクッションカットのピンクダイヤモンドのエンゲージメントリングを身につけているが、セレモニーでは外すという。 しかし彼女は、その代わりにドルチェ＆ガッバーナのハイジュエリーコレクションである「アルタ ジョイエッレリア」のピアスをつけることにした。 このピアスは、1つの石からカットされた4つのダイヤモンドがホワイトゴールドにはめ込まれたもので、この撮影のために装甲車で運ばれてきた。 近くの小高い丘の上には、厳かな雰囲気の警備員も立っている。 「私たちは伝統にはそこまでこだわっていないんです」とサンチェスは話す。 「伝統は好きだけど、55歳の私にはちょっと合わないところもあるので」。 とはいえ、結婚式当日までに新郎が新婦に会わない習慣など、いくつかは取り入れるつもりだそうだ。 また、ドルチェ＆ガッバーナのピアスは彼女にとっての「サムシングボロー（結婚式で花嫁が身につけると幸せになれると言われている“サムシングフォー”のひとつで、すでに幸せな結婚生活を送っている人から何かを借りて身につける風習）」だ。 では、「サムシングブルー（何か青いもの）」は何だろう？ 「“ブルーオリジン”です」とサンチェスは答える。 「宇宙飛行をしたときのものなんですけど」と、彼女はベゾスのために秘密のお土産をロケットに積んで持ち帰ったことを明かした。 「宇宙から地球を見て、また地上に降りてくるなんて。 言葉では言い表せないほど感動しました。 人生で最高の体験。 ジェフは、『（宇宙飛行は）想像以上に君を変えるだろう』と私に言いましたが、まさにその通りです。 ものの見方もですが、精神的にも」 地球の大気圏と宇宙空間の境界線であるケルマン線までの約11分間の旅がドレスに対する考え方を変えたのか、サンチェスはレッドカーペットで好んで着用するモダンなベアトップスタイルから、1958年の映画『月夜の出来事』でソフィア・ローレン演じるシンチアがトムと結婚する際に着用したハイネックのレースドレスをベースにしたタイムレスなデザインがいいと思うようになった。 「『シンプルでセクシーなモダンなドレスが欲しい』という気持ちから、『ある瞬間を印象付けるような一着が欲しい』に変わり、今に至ります。...

18097607557596152,2025-07-02 13:50:56,en,INSTAGRAM,"  Happy publication week #FogandFury Book 1 in the Haven Thriller Series. Thank you #ThomasandMercerPublishing #NetGalley & #RachelHowzell for my early copy. Do you have anyplace near where you live that you go to every summer? Me: There are so many, but claudiosgreenport is amazing and an absolute must Description She's a new PI in a beautiful seaside town. It's dirtier than it looks—and more dangerous too—in a twisting novel of suspense by the Anthony Award–nominated author of These Toxic Things. After ten years on the force, LAPD cop Sonny Rush relocates with her elderly mother to peaceful Haven, California, to join her godfather's burgeoning PI business. What crimes could possibly happen in a town nicknamed “Mayberry by the Sea”? Sonny's first case: find Figgy, a missing goldendoodle last seen sporting a Versace collar. At least scouting out a dognapper gives Sonny a chance to get to know her new neighbors. Forty-eight hours in town and Figgy's disappearance entangles Sonny in an unwelcome reunion with her ex, one of Haven's wealthiest citizens. And when the body of a teenage boy is found along a popular hiking trail, Sonny is drawn into a web of strange beyond anything she ever saw in LA. Then comes a local's warning: question everything. Haven hides secrets that could destroy its idyllic facade. Or destroy Sonny first. Review Sonny Rush has left the LAPD to work for her godfather as a private investigator. She has moved to the small town of Haven. She is dumbstruck to discover that someone she happens to know very very well lives there. That fact, however, is not a pleasant surprise. Neither is her first case. Finding a missing dog. Is this what Sonny's life has become? Trying to care for her elderly mother and following leads generated from missing dog posters? Not exactly. The death of a teenager draws her into this town that is hiding many many secrets. I wasn't a fan of her maybe ex-boyfriend, but I was a fan of the mystery surrounding Haven. #ReneesRamblings #JulyReads #AmazonPublishingCreatorProgram #SummerMysteryandThrillerBook Book Review| NetGalleyReview| July 2025 Book | Summer Thriller"

mov_AB28BCB31E9E0514AAFCF92C6D454F1F,2025-07-02 17:12:53,en,WEB,"  They say, fashion comes its fair share of faux pas and flair! While luxurious wardrobes and style statements speak for the 'flair' part, the faux pas part most certainly includes the mispronunciations of the well-known fashion brands (despite those being extremely famous). And while these mishaps are quite cliché, they're not chic at all. Because let's be honest – in the world of fashion, half the battle is looking the part, and the rest of it is acing the etiquette (which includes the correct pronunciation of popular fashion brands). Mispronouncing a luxury label can cost you credibility faster than you can say “Céline.” Lucky for you, we've done the hard work. From Parisian labels to Italian icons and streetwear staples, this guide is sprinkled with phonetic line-drawing, brand backstories, and quirky insider tips to help you glide through any style conversation with ease. So, say goodbye to awkward pauses and hello to stylish confidence – let's break it down, brand by brand. French elegance: Subtle, chic, and tricky Hermès – Not “Her-meez,” but gentle vowel start, silent 'H' and 's': “air‑MEZ” or “er‑MEZ”, not “her‑meez.” Givenchy – Often butchered as “Gah‑vin‑chee.” The correct French flourish? “zhee‑VOHN‑shee”, with soft 'G', nasal 'on', and a gentle final “‑shee.” Chanel – Forget “Shan‑elle.” The proper style? “SHUH‑nel.” Chic, crisp, simple, and oh-so‑Parisian. Balmain – Yes, it's not “BAL‑mayn.” Roll it out like “bal‑MAH”, trailing off the 'n' softly for that French flair. Yves Saint Laurent – Drop those hard Ts! The smooth version: “EEV san‑loh‑rah(n)”, a lovers' lane nasal finish. Christian Louboutin – Strut smoothly: “kris‑tee‑ahn loo‑boo‑TAHN”, not “tin.” Christian Lacroix – “LA-kwa.” So “kris‑tee‑ahn luh‑kwa”, rolling that l–r combo beautifully. Comme des Garçons – Play it subtly: “comb‑DAY gar‑SON”, letting the 's' fade, nasal 'on' intact. Italian icons: Bold, bright, and vowely Gucci – It's “GOO‑chee”, emphasis on the first syllable, never “Goo‑kee.” Versace – Despite the trendy slip, it's properly “ver‑SAH‑cheh.” Donatella herself has piped up to confirm it. Prada – Simple and sweet: “PRAH‑dah”, sturdy first syllable, light second. Moschino – The fun-filled style comes through in “mos‑KEY‑no”, not “mos‑chee‑no.” Bottega Veneta – Soft and elegant: “boh‑TEH‑gah veh‑NEH‑ta”, a solid roll in every segment. Dolce & Gabbana – Smooth Italian gloss: “DOL‑chay eh ga‑BAN‑eh”, not “Gab‑anna.” Spanish flair and subtle sound Balenciaga – Spanish royalty. Break it into “bah‑LEN‑see‑AH‑gah,” emphasizing the “AH” and smoothing past the “cia.” Loewe – Spanish elegance meets German twist: say “lo‑WEH‑vay”, not “low‑eeve.” Athleisure staples Adidas – A German classic: “AH‑dee‑dahs”, emphasis on the first syllable, founder Adi Dassler's namesake. Nike – Named after the Greek goddess, it's “NY‑kee”, not “Nighk.” Porsche – Elegant German soap-opera: “POR‑shuh”, with a soft “‑uh” ending. Cross-cultural gems Bvlgari (Latin-script brand) – Pronounce “BOOL‑gah‑ree,” highlighting the “u” after “B.” Cartier – Soft, refined: “kar‑tee‑AY”, not “Car‑tee‑er.” Jacquemus – From French fashion forward: “ZHAK‑moose.” Celine – A blend of syllables: “seh‑LEEN,” soft start, piercing end. Nailing the correct pronunciation of a fashion might seem like a superficial conquest – but it isn't just about speaking the name; it's about stepping into the essence of each brand. Elevating your fashion conversations goes beyond clothes – it's about knowing the names and pronouncing them with confidence, creativity, and cultural awareness. From the sonorous softness of French designers to the vibrant clarity of Italian labels, each namescape tells a story – learn the sound, share the style. With this guide, you're not just knocking it out of the vocabulary park; you're stepping onto the stylistic stage with poise and pizzazz...."

mov_B5A76778D7F7E2CCF221E860E09FF3AB,2025-07-02 19:17:26,en,WEB,"  ABSTRACT The designer showed his first men's collection. Was it any good? FULL TEXT A photo of Christian Dior's original salon stretched the width of the Invalides, the gold-domed palace where Napoleon is buried, offering a fish-eye view of the past to the throngs shrieking outside - and a sign of just where Dior believes it belongs in the pantheon of French power. Inside, dove-gray velvet lined the walls of a temporary event space and displayed two rare 18th-century oils by Jean Siméon Chardin on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland and the Louvre. Robert Pattinson gossiped with Josh O'Connor. Donatella Versace schmoozed with Roger Federer. A pregnant Rihanna arrived with ASAP Rocky a mere 45 minutes after the official start time. That's how much anticipation there was for the Dior men's show. The filmmaker Luca Guadagnino was even trailing around to document the moment. It was Jonathan Anderson's debut as the creative director/savior of the house, the first designer to be put in charge of both men's and women's wear. And under all the buzz, a giant question mark hovered: Could the former Loewe wunderkind reignite excitement not just in the brand but in fashion? Mr. Anderson made it look easy. Literally. Beginning with his take on the Bar jacket, the most famous Dior women's wear shape - the one that prompted the Harper's Bazaar editor Carmel Snow to jump out of her seat shrieking, ""It's a New Look!"" in 1947. It was reimagined in a Donegal tweed with a flat back and a whiff of the hourglass at the front, as if it retained a vague memory of what it once was. With it, he paired not a shirt but a stiff white stock collar and a pair of oversize white cotton cargo shorts, each side sporting elaborate folds to create the plumped out silhouette of a goose, or a 1948 couture dress called the Delft. Go on, shake your tail feathers. If little Lord Fauntleroy had spent a year at U.S.C. and then returned for a pickup game of basketball at Versailles, this is how he might dress. It was not a capital N New Look. It wasn't that radical, or shocking. But it was an awfully charming newish one. And it was situated smack in the middle of the tension between formality and informality, men's wear and women's wear, commerce and creativity (Mr. Anderson's own work at Loewe and Uniqlo and what he inherited at Dior), which seems to define this particular moment. No one is all one thing or another. Neither are their clothes. Neither are the totems of wealth. What Mr. Anderson proposed was a clear and convincing argument that contradictions can gracefully coexist. Most of all, he put forward the belief that fashion and wearability are not irreconcilable ideas - that you either have to look bizarro or look boring. For every highfalutin garment there was an equal and opposite this-old-thing, usually worn together. Velvet frock coats were paired with faded jeans in Japanese denim. Olive green puffer coats and down vests were cut with trapeze backs. The exact pattern of another classic Dior dress, the Caprice, with its elaborately swathed peplum skirt, was applied to a pair of loose khakis, giving one leg the fillip of a drape. An 18th-century frock coat was exactingly reproduced - in moleskin. There were shamrocks on tennis shoes and high-tops with driving shoe soles; cable knits under elaborate waist coats. There was a lot of neck action. Book totes borrowed, again, from the women's line, with actual book titles on them from Baudelaire and Françoise Sagan. Mr. Anderson had clearly done his homework. Easter eggs to early Dior were everywhere. Even the labels inside the clothes were in the designer's preferred silk faille. He was never going to toss everything out the window and start again. He couldn't. Dior is a multibillion-dollar business, after all, and some of his predecessors (Raf Simons, Hedi Slimane, John Galliano) were his idols. Once upon a time, a designer might have had the arrogance to wipe the slate clean, but this is a new age. The industry is in crisis, and the creative tectonic plates are shifting. It is why Mr. Anderson invited seemingly every other designer in Paris to join him at the show. It is also why he picked the Chardin oils and why he seeded his Instagram with Warhol Polaroids of Lee Radziwill and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Chardin, he said in a preview, ""kind of loosened up the still life""; Warhol made pop culture high art. Both crystallized an inflection point in culture...."

Haven't bought any in several years, and their prices are much higher than they were initially (although still a steal compared to CK anything, let alone 2xist or Cin2 or LASC or MV or 2eros or god forbid Gucci or Versace, etc.), but that brand has (or used to have?) surprisingly luxurious and exceptionally comfortable bamboo trunks, briefs, boxer briefs, and other stuff. They've got fly-front, no-fly, double-pouch, separate pouch, etc. I used to get them on Amazon, and they are made in China (home of bamboo experts though!!) , but they may be available elsewhere for all I know."

The event generated $222 million in media impact value for the brands involved, according to analytics firm Launchmetrics. By comparison, that's 60 percent higher than the entirety of New York Fashion Week last season. The weekend's biggest winner was Dolce & Gabbana, who designed the corseted, white, lace dress with a high neck, long sleeves and a mermaid-cut skirt Sanchez Bezos wore to the ceremony. The brand earned $14.5 million in media impact value, 28 percent more than it did for its Fall/Winter 2025 runway show earlier this year. Other beneficiaries of the Bezos effect were Schiaparelli, who designed the corset dress Sanchez Bezos wore to the welcome dinner, and Versace, which was behind the pink silk chiffon and Swarovski crystals-covered mermaid gown she wore to the wedding party, one of the weekend's final events. This all came despite the fact that much of the public response to the wedding leaned negative, with the ceremony's excess striking a nerve across social media.

The feature comes on the heels of her massive success with “Goodbye Princess,” which has surpassed 174 million views on YouTube — a testament to her global resonance and emotional storytelling. “Goodbye Princess” – Her Personal Anthem Among her discography, “Goodbye Princess” holds a special place. “This song reflects my emotional journey — from someone who used to hesitate to express herself to someone who can now be more at ease and confident in being who she truly is.” Beyond music, the accompanying visuals and campaign became a cornerstone of her #EmpowerHer movement, which supports real-world empowerment for women by providing employment support and helping them rebuild their confidence. Empowerment Through Art and Action For Tia, music is a powerful vessel to communicate strength and self-discovery. “Right now, I want to express the sense of empowerment girls can find during their growth journey,” she said. Her #EmpowerHer initiative, born during the creative process of “Goodbye Princess,” channels proceeds and awareness toward tangible support for women facing societal pressures and stereotypes. “Small efforts, when multiplied over 365 days, can grow into something significant,” she said. “Empowerment begins when we help one another rise — especially during tough times.” A Style Icon with Substance Beyond music, Tia continues to shape global fashion discourse. Describing her style as “minimalism, comfort, and soft personality,” she values timelessness and quality, often opting for classic silhouettes in neutral tones. Her fashion inspiration? Rosie Huntington-Whiteley — a woman she admires for her strength, elegance, and purpose. Tia's passion for fashion is on full display in her ELLE Malaysia cover story, where she dons looks from Louis Vuitton, FENDI, Brunello Cucinelli, LOEWE, Ferragamo, Shu Shu Tong, TODS and Versace. This latest cover adds to her impressive roster of features on Vogue, Marie Claire, Harper's Bazaar, Rollercoaster, Flaunt Magazine, ICON, tmrw, and Grazia. Looking Forward: Healing, Self-Discovery, and Staying Grounded In today's fast-paced world, Tia prioritizes healing and self-understanding through activities like painting, meditation, and flower arranging. “You have to be honest with yourself and know what you need in order to grow into the person you want to be,” she said. “Progress over perfection — that's what I live by.” From creating art that touches hearts to advocating for societal change, Tia Lee continues to shape the cultural landscape—on her own terms, and always with a message of strength and sincerity.

Hustling and buying myself nothin' but Aveeno and whatever lotion I could grab from Walmart. Luxury wasn't even a thought. Then he came along, love bombed me, spoiled me, took me on trips, made me feel soft… until he started withholding it to make me question if I was really that girl. But by then? I already knew I was. I had been doing the work. So when it came time to walk away, I did. And baby, I ain't stopped treating myself since. My perfume collection? Built it. Brick by brick. Sephora sale by B&BW sale. Klarna and Afterpay been whoopin' me, but I smell like pretty every time I step out. And now? Now I'm being pursued by a whole provider. Like grown man, show-up-for-you, make-his-intentions-clear type. We've seen each other five times in three weeks and he's not playin' no games. I've met this man smelling like Jimmy Choo, Loyal to You, some yummy pistachio layers, Versace Bright Crystal, and Covered in Roses. Every time he's near me I'm smelling goodt! And he's picking up the softness, the sweetness, the standard. We talked about my scent addiction, and he said, “That's an addiction I can support.” Oh really, sir? He asked about what perfumes I like. When I listed the gourmonds I'm into right now he was calmly excited like, “Oh yeah? I look forward to smelling all them.” He's paying attention. Today, I told him my car was dirty. He asked me to met him at the car wash. I wore a soft scent and he showed up with a dozen pink roses and cleaned my car. This man is pursuing me with presence and intention because I've made it clear how I treat myself. He didn't discover my softness. He's just recognizing the standard I set and so far it aligns with his desire to find his wife and provide her with a soft life. So yeah… this is a smell good post. But it's also a PSA: Take care of you. Smell like what you want to attract. Whether it's peace, luxury, love, or just feelin' damn good after your shower, layer it. Spray it. Own it. I used to be a hardbody jawn. Nobody could tell me nothin'. Now I'm like, “Lord, lead me. Sir, provide for me. I'm a soft girl who smells like whipped vanilla and I deserve everything.” Buy the smell goods, sis...."

mov_7989CC131800A30B6EACBB6E5E0DBDA1,2025-07-03 04:49:21,fr,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[fr]«Madame est servie»: Judith Light: «Avec Tony, l'alchimie a été immédiate» L'inoubliable interprète d'Angela Bower à la télévision dans les années 80 est aussi une militante engagée. Rencontre. parLaurent Flückiger, Monte-Carlo Une femme d'affaires divorcée qui engage un homme à tout faire avant que leur relation ne dépasse le cadre professionnel, c'est bien sûr «Madame est servie». Créée en 1984, la sitcom, addictive, a occupé nos débuts de soirées sur M6 entre 1989 et 1995 et est devenue culte. Trente ans plus tard, à 76 ans, Judith Light, qui jouait cette femme active du nom d'Angela Bower, est bardée de récompenses et tourne dans les séries les plus en vue. Elle est aussi une militante engagée en faveur des droits des personnes LGBTQ+ et de la lutte contre le sida. C'est au Festival de Télévision de Monte-Carlo, où elle était présidente du jury Fictions en juin dernier, que nous avons rencontrée l'actrice avec ses immenses lunettes sur le bout du nez. Angela Bower, votre personnage dans «Madame est servie», était très populaire dans les années 80. Pourquoi les gens l'aimaient autant? L'inversion des genres. Vous aviez enfin une femme suffisamment forte pour dire: «Je vais travailler et je vais engager un homme pour faire le ménage.» C'était précieux pour les femmes, pour les jeunes femmes, pour les hommes et pour les garçons. À l'époque, nous ne nous en rendions pas compte. C'est plus tard que tellement de jeunes femmes ont commencé à me dire qu'Angela a été un modèle pour elles. Et je sais que des garçons vont voir Tony pour lui dire qu'il a été un modèle pour eux. Qu'y a-t-il de mal à être un homme de ménage? «Madame est servie» était drôle et charmant, mais il y avait aussi une profondeur et une substance sous-jacentes. On sentait une grande alchimie à l'écran entre vous et Tony Danza, c'est arrivé automatiquement? Oui, tout de suite. À la fin de notre audition, le réalisateur, Bill Persky — un grand réalisateur — nous a dit: «Cette alchimie, c'est de la magie!» Et c'était vrai. «Avec Tony, on s'envoie des SMS. Ça fait un moment qu'on ne s'est pas vus» Êtes-vous toujours en contact avec Tony? On s'envoie des SMS. Ça fait un moment qu'on ne s'est pas vus. Tony a son show, il se produit et chante partout. Il est au Café Carlyle à New York (ndlr.: dans «Tony Danza: Sinatra & Stories»). Il fait ce qu'il a toujours voulu faire. Je n'ai pas encore eu l'occasion de le voir en spectacle, mais j'espère le faire bientôt. Une suite de «Madame est servie» avait été évoquée il y a cinq ans. Mais sans vous. Pourquoi? Je n'en sais pas assez pour pouvoir répondre à cette question. Je ne sais même pas si le projet est toujours sur la table. En 2024, on a pu vous voir dans la minisérie «Before» (Apple TV+), mettant en vedette Billy Crystal. C'est votre amitié avec lui qui vous a convaincue d'accepter ce rôle, n'est-ce pas? Pas seulement. C'était l'écriture et le personnage. Par ailleurs, la réincarnation est un sujet qui m'a toujours intéressée. On a eu une rencontre avec Billy et le scénariste, et il a dit: «Je pense que ça va vous plaire.» Et ça m'a plu. J'ai toujours su que je travaillerais avec Billy un jour. «Il y a eu tellement de progrès, et c'est un vrai scandale de voir que les choses semblent reculer» Vous avez travaillé avec le prolifique et talentueux showrunner Ryan Murphy sur la série «The Politician» et sur deux chapitres de l'anthologie «American Crime Story», «The Assassination of Gianni Versace» et «Impeachment». Qu'est-ce qui vous parle dans sa manière de raconter les histoires? Excellente question. Ryan sait exactement ce qu'il veut, il a une vision puissante, il la communique à tout le monde, et tout le monde est sur la même longueur d'onde...."

Theo cáo trạng, đầu năm 2021, bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương bắt đầu kinh doanh online các mặt hàng cao cấp như thực phẩm chức năng, mỹ phẩm, túi xách, nước hoa, đồng hồ... từ các thương hiệu nổi tiếng như Hermes, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Versace... Để có vốn mở rộng quy mô kinh doanh, từ tháng 3/2021, Phương kêu gọi vợ chồng Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh cùng góp vốn đầu tư. Cả ba lập nhóm chat có tên ""KIM MONOLOLY GROUP"" trên ứng dụng Viber để giao dịch. Sau đó, Phương tự lập các đơn hàng, ghi rõ ngày đi - ngày về và mức lãi suất cao (từ 10% đến 100%) để kêu gọi vốn từ Long, Trinh và những người thân quen của họ. Mỗi đơn hàng có giá trị từ 10 triệu đồng đến hơn 4 tỷ đồng. Các bị cáo tại phiên toà. Việc góp vốn diễn ra suôn sẻ, lợi nhuận cao khiến nhiều người tiếp tục tham gia. Vợ chồng Long và Trinh còn hạ mức lãi suất cho các nhà đầu tư cấp dưới để hưởng chênh lệch từ mức lãi suất mà Phương cam kết. Tuy nhiên, sau một thời gian, hoạt động kinh doanh thua lỗ, hàng hóa không tiêu thụ được khiến Phương mất khả năng chi trả. Để tiếp tục duy trì dòng tiền và trả lãi cho các đơn cũ, bị cáo này lập các đơn hàng giả với lãi suất cao để lôi kéo nhà đầu tư mới, thực chất là chiếm đoạt tiền. Từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, Phương đã huy động vốn thông qua 1.158 đơn hàng, nhận tổng cộng 505,16 tỷ đồng, đã tất toán 990 đơn hàng với lãi suất hơn 91,39 tỷ đồng. Còn lại 168 đơn hàng chưa tất toán, tương ứng 112,3 tỷ đồng. Sau khi trừ phần lãi đã trả, số tiền Phương chiếm đoạt thực tế là 20,3 tỷ đồng. Số tiền này được Phương sử dụng vào các mục đích cá nhân như thuê nhà, thuê kho bãi, vận chuyển hàng hóa, xoay vòng dòng tiền và tiêu xài. Đến ngày 12/4/2022, Phương chính thức tuyên bố mất khả năng thanh toán. Riêng đối với Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh, quá trình điều tra cho thấy, từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, 2 bị cáo này sử dụng tiền cá nhân, tiền của người thân và tiền của các nhà đầu tư để đầu tư cho Phương. Đáng chú ý, ngay trước thời điểm Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ, ngày 12/4/2022, Phương vẫn gửi 12 đơn hàng với lãi suất từ 6% đến 25% để Long và Trinh tiếp tục huy động vốn. 3 người đầu tư là anh Nguyễn Tiến Phương 500 triệu đồng, chị Ngô Thị Diệu Lý 850 triệu đồng và anh Trần Hùng 794 triệu đồng. Tuy nhiên, chỉ vài giờ sau, Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ. Vợ chồng Long, Trinh chỉ hoàn trả lại cho anh Trần Hùng toàn bộ số tiền đã góp nhưng không thông báo cho chị Lý và anh Phương, cũng không trả lại số tiền 1,35 tỷ đồng mà đã chiếm đoạt để sử dụng cá nhân. Ngoài ra, sau khi Phương mất khả năng chi trả, vợ chồng Long, Trinh đã bán căn nhà ở số 4/8 Phạm Ngọc Thạch, Tp.Huế với giá 4,3 tỷ đồng để trả nợ cho người thân nhưng vẫn không hoàn trả số tiền 1,35 tỷ đồng cho chị Lý và anh Phương. Tại phiên tòa, 3 bị cáo thành khẩn khai báo, ăn năn hối hận về hành vi của mình, các bị cáo xin HĐXX cho được hưởng mức án nhẹ nhất để sớm trở về với gia đình. Sau khi nghị án, HĐXX tuyên phạt bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương 14 năm tù về tội Lừa đảo chiếm đoạt tài sản, bị cáo Phạm Thanh Long 5 năm tù và Nguyễn Thu Trinh 3 năm 6 tháng tù về tội Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản.

mov_9F93F246992CDBF33B4715FDB321BD65,2025-07-03 06:51:14,en,WEB,"  HONG KONG SAR - Media OutReach Newswire - 3 July 2025 - Global fashion and music icon Tia Lee (Lee Yu Fen) takes center stage on the cover of ELLE Malaysia, where she reflects on her multifaceted journey as an artist, changemaker, and advocate for women's empowerment. The feature comes on the heels of her massive success with “Goodbye Princess,“ which has surpassed 174 million views on YouTube — a testament to her global resonance and emotional storytelling. “Goodbye Princess” – Her Personal Anthem Among her discography, “Goodbye Princess” holds a special place. “This song reflects my emotional journey — from someone who used to hesitate to express herself to someone who can now be more at ease and confident in being who she truly is.” Beyond music, the accompanying visuals and campaign became a cornerstone of her #EmpowerHer movement, which supports real-world empowerment for women by providing employment support and helping them rebuild their confidence. Empowerment Through Art and Action For Tia, music is a powerful vessel to communicate strength and self-discovery. “Right now, I want to express the sense of empowerment girls can find during their growth journey,“ she said. Her #EmpowerHer initiative, born during the creative process of “Goodbye Princess,“ channels proceeds and awareness toward tangible support for women facing societal pressures and stereotypes. “Small efforts, when multiplied over 365 days, can grow into something significant,“ she said. “Empowerment begins when we help one another rise — especially during tough times.” A Style Icon with Substance Beyond music, Tia continues to shape global fashion discourse. Describing her style as “minimalism, comfort, and soft personality,“ she values timelessness and quality, often opting for classic silhouettes in neutral tones. Her fashion inspiration? Rosie Huntington-Whiteley — a woman she admires for her strength, elegance, and purpose. Tia's passion for fashion is on full display in her ELLE Malaysia cover story, where she dons looks from Louis Vuitton, FENDI, Brunello Cucinelli, LOEWE, Ferragamo, Shu Shu Tong, TODS and Versace. This latest cover adds to her impressive roster of features on Vogue, Marie Claire, Harper's Bazaar, Rollercoaster, Flaunt Magazine, ICON, tmrw, and Grazia. Looking Forward: Healing, Self-Discovery, and Staying Grounded In today's fast-paced world, Tia prioritizes healing and self-understanding through activities like painting, meditation, and flower arranging. “You have to be honest with yourself and know what you need in order to grow into the person you want to be,“ she said. “Progress over perfection — that's what I live by.” From creating art that touches hearts to advocating for societal change, Tia Lee continues to shape the cultural landscape—on her own terms, and always with a message of strength and sincerity. https://elle.my/istimewa/revolusi-tia-lee/ https://www.facebook.com/leeyufentialee/ https://www.instagram.com/leeyufen/"

2589BEB9B14AC7175588ED5AAA109DC6,2025-07-03 07:18:43,en,PRINT,"  A photo of Christian Dior's original salon stretched the width of the Invalides, the gold-domed palace where Napoleon is buried, offering a fish-eye view of the past to the throngs shrieking outside -- and a sign of just where Dior believes it belongs in the pantheon of French power. Inside, dove-gray velvet lined the walls of a temporary event space and displayed two rare 18th-century oils by Jean Siméon Chardin on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland and the Louvre. Robert Pattinson gossiped with Josh O'Connor. Donatella Versace schmoozed with Roger Federer. A pregnant Rihanna arrived with ASAP Rocky a mere 45 minutes after the official start time. That's how much anticipation there was for the Dior men's show. The filmmaker Luca Guadagnino was even trailing around to document the moment. It was Jonathan Anderson's debut as the creative director/savior of the house, the first designer to be put in charge of both men's and women's wear. And under all the buzz, a giant question mark hovered: Could the former Loewe wunderkind reignite excitement not just in the brand but in fashion? Mr. Anderson made it look easy. Literally. Beginning with his take on the Bar jacket, the most famous Dior women's wear shape -- the one that prompted the Harper's Bazaar editor Carmel Snow to jump out of her seat shrieking, ''It's a New Look!'' in 1947. It was reimagined in a Donegal tweed with a flat back and a whiff of the hourglass at the front, as if it retained a vague memory of what it once was. With it, he paired not a shirt but a stiff white stock collar and a pair of oversize white cotton cargo shorts, each side sporting elaborate folds to create the plumped out silhouette of a goose, or a 1948 couture dress called the Delft. Go on, shake your tail feathers. If little Lord Fauntleroy had spent a year at U.S.C. and then returned for a pickup game of basketball at Versailles, this is how he might dress. It was not a capital N New Look. It wasn't that radical, or shocking. But it was an awfully charming newish one. And it was situated smack in the middle of the tension between formality and informality, men's wear and women's wear, commerce and creativity (Mr. Anderson's own work at Loewe and Uniqlo and what he inherited at Dior), which seems to define this particular moment. No one is all one thing or another. Neither are their clothes. Neither are the totems of wealth. What Mr. Anderson proposed was a clear and convincing argument that contradictions can gracefully coexist. Most of all, he put forward the belief that fashion and wearability are not irreconcilable ideas -- that you either have to look bizarro or look boring. For every highfalutin garment there was an equal and opposite this-old-thing, usually worn together. Velvet frock coats were paired with faded jeans in Japanese denim. Olive green puffer coats and down vests were cut with trapeze backs. The exact pattern of another classic Dior dress, the Caprice, with its elaborately swathed peplum skirt, was applied to a pair of loose khakis, giving one leg the fillip of a drape. An 18th-century frock coat was exactingly reproduced -- in moleskin. There were shamrocks on tennis shoes and high-tops with driving shoe soles; cable knits under elaborate waist coats. There was a lot of neck action. Book totes borrowed, again, from the women's line, with actual book titles on them from Baudelaire and Françoise Sagan. Mr. Anderson had clearly done his homework. Easter eggs to early Dior were everywhere. Even the labels inside the clothes were in the designer's preferred silk faille. He was never going to toss everything out the window and start again. He couldn't. Dior is a multibillion-dollar business, after all, and some of his predecessors (Raf Simons, Hedi Slimane, John Galliano) were his idols. Once upon a time, a designer might have had the arrogance to wipe the slate clean, but this is a new age. The industry is in crisis, and the creative tectonic plates are shifting. It is why Mr. Anderson invited seemingly every other designer in Paris to join him at the show. It is also why he picked the Chardin oils and why he seeded his Instagram with Warhol Polaroids of Lee Radziwill and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Chardin, he said in a preview, ''kind of loosened up the still life''; Warhol made pop culture high art. Both crystallized an inflection point in culture. Mr. Anderson clearly wants his Dior to do the same. His show invitation came borne on a china plate with three china eggs on top, as if a reminder that the men's wear was just the beginning (and maybe to acknowledge that some shells may get broken along the way). Fair enough. The result may not knock you sideways, but it's likely to make you sit up and buy...."

Together, a union of transcendent forces, fortified by their unwavering conviction and strength. “The energy on this campaign was extraordinary. It was all about friendship, loyalty, and love. These images were created to celebrate the soul of the Versace woman. Her strength, her spirit, her attitude, and her heart. Every collection is a story, and this campaign is the story of Versace. Inspiring the present and anticipating the future.” — Donatella Versace Claudia Schiffer, Kate Moss, Kristen McMenamy, Amber Valletta, Natasha Poly, Saskia de Brauw, Liu Wen, Mica Argañaraz, Anok Yai, Mila Van Eeten, and Jacqui Hooper. Stood tall, in a powerful dialogue between FW25 and archival dresses—iconic, definitively Versace silhouettes, formed of the House's signature metallic mesh. Sinuous and sculpted, like liquid gold, casting light on Versace's rule-breaking sensuality and innovation. A deep synergy with the new V-emblem, forged from metal, decorating the newly launched Virtus bag. A rounded, semi-circular top-handle style, speaking to Versace's inherent tensions; embodying the Versace woman's unyielding embracing of hard and soft. The campaign, captured by long-standing collaborators Mert and Marcus, is a definitive culmination of Donatella Versace's unparalleled vision, reaffirming the indelible legacy of the House while igniting the path forward. It stands as a proud celebration of Versace's uncompromising spirit, empowering unapologetic self-expression on the cusp of an exhilarating new chapter.

Cáo trạng của VKSND TP Huế cho hay, đầu năm 2021, Phương bắt đầu kinh doanh online các mặt hàng thực phẩm chức năng, mỹ phẩm, túi xách, nước hoa, đồng hồ... từ nhiều thương hiệu nổi tiếng như Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel, Hermes, Versace... Phương đã kêu gọi vợ chồng Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh cùng góp vốn đầu tư. Cả 3 người lập nhóm chat “Kim Monololy Group” trên ứng dụng Viber để giao dịch. Phương tự lập các đơn hàng, ghi rõ ngày đi, ngày về và mức lãi suất cao (từ 10% đến 100%) để kêu gọi vốn từ Long, Trinh và những người thân quen. Mỗi đơn hàng có giá trị cao từ 10 triệu đồng đến hơn 4 tỷ đồng. Nhiều người đã tham gia góp vốn kinh doanh online cùng Phương. Sau một thời gian, hoạt động kinh doanh thua lỗ, hàng hóa không tiêu thụ được khiến Phương mất khả năng chi trả. Nhằm tiếp tục duy trì dòng tiền và trả lãi cho các đơn cũ, Phương lập các đơn hàng giả với lãi suất cao để lôi kéo nhà đầu tư mới, thực chất là chiếm đoạt tiền. Trong thời gian từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, Phương đã huy động vốn thông qua 1.158 đơn hàng, nhận tổng cộng 505,16 tỷ đồng. Phương đã tất toán 990 đơn hàng với lãi suất hơn 91,39 tỷ đồng. Còn lại 168 đơn hàng chưa tất toán, tương ứng 112,3 tỷ đồng. Sau khi trừ phần lãi đã trả, số tiền Phương chiếm đoạt thực tế là 20,3 tỷ đồng. Số tiền này được Phương sử dụng vào các mục đích cá nhân như thuê nhà, thuê kho bãi, vận chuyển hàng hóa, xoay vòng dòng tiền và tiêu xài cá nhân. Đến ngày 12/4/2022, Phương tuyên bố mất khả năng thanh toán. 3 bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương, Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh tại phiên tòa sơ thẩm. (Ảnh: M.N) Riêng với Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh, từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, đã dùng tiền cá nhân, tiền của người thân và tiền của các nhà đầu tư để đầu tư cho Phương. Hai bị cáo này đã nhận tiền từ anh Nguyễn Tiến Phương 500 triệu đồng, chị Ngô Thị Diệu Lý 850 triệu đồng và anh Trần Hùng 794 triệu đồng. Long và Trinh chỉ hoàn trả lại cho anh Trần Hùng toàn bộ số tiền đã góp, còn chị Lý và anh Phương không được hoàn lại số tiền tổng 1,35 tỷ đồng. Hội đồng xét xử Tòa án nhân dân TP Huế đã tuyên phạt Lê Thị Hồng Phương 14 năm tù về tội “Lừa đảo, chiếm đoạt tài sản”; Phạm Thanh Long 5 năm tù và Nguyễn Thu Trinh 3 năm 6 tháng tù về tội “Lạm dụng tín nhiệm, chiếm đoạt tài sản”."

If you are rich and attended luxury shops like Gucci  and Versace , I understand. But if people don't have thousands of dollars to spend, so Temu is good choice. In my country( Sweden) in smaller town shops sell almost only Made in China products and cheapest of them, because everybody hunts for profit. From Temu you can chose little better things. My wife bought me 3 pairs of summer shoes from Temu and all are better quality amd cheaper than they sell in local shops. So your statement about ""Temu is crap"" is not very convincing for me. If you are rich, this is another story of course. But not everybody is rich."

Recent reports have revealed that one of the journalists' wedding outfits was stolen by an uninvited guest. In addition, it was also reported that another of Sánchez's dresses nearly caught fire, adding to the chaos of her and Bezos's big day. A Dress Gone Without A Trace  KCS Presse / MEGA In a shocking post-wedding twist, one of Sánchez's elaborate wedding outfits has mysteriously vanished. The stolen gown, part of a jaw-dropping 27-dress wardrobe curated for the three-day Venetian celebration, disappeared under curious circumstances. The  Daily Mail   cited a report from the Italian tabloid   Corriere della Sera , which stated that  the dress was reported missing shortly after the lavish event. However, the specific designer behind the gown has not been publicly revealed. The alleged culprit is an elegantly dressed woman who reportedly slipped past tight security without an official invite. While she was “kindly escorted out,” her personal information wasn't recorded, and that's when the disappearance occurred. It is believed that this mysterious gatecrasher may have stolen one of the bride's gowns during the chaos of the weekend-long festivities. Lauren Sánchez's Dream Gown Nearly Catches Fire View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lauren Sánchez Bezos (@laurensanchezbezos) As if a stolen wedding dress wasn't enough, another of Sánchez's gowns nearly went up in flames. Reports claim that a Dolce & Gabbana gown intended for the ceremony caught fire at some point during the celebration. Thankfully, it wasn't the dress she wore to say “I do.” That particular gown, designed by Domenico Dolce himself, was a breathtaking masterpiece featuring a high lace turtleneck, floral sleeves, and a sweeping train. Sánchez dazzled guests as she walked down the aisle on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore in a luxurious ensemble, handpicked after a magical fitting in Milan. “It was more powerful than I thought,” she told Vogue of the moment she tried it on for the first time, describing how the dress made her feel like a ""princess."" Lauren Sánchez Shared the Gown That Took Jeff Bezos' Breath Away View this post on Instagram A post shared by Lauren Sánchez Bezos (@laurensanchezbezos) Although Bezos reportedly begged to see the dress ahead of the ceremony, Sánchez stuck to tradition. “I almost gave in,” she admitted in the interview with Vogue . “But I want it to be a surprise. As you get a little older, not many things surprise you. I can't wait to see his face.” Sánchez gave fans a glimpse of the stunning moment on Instagram, sharing a romantic post-wedding photo of her and Bezos, captioned with their wedding date. She also uploaded a carousel of behind-the-scenes photos, including shots of the dress being styled by Dolce himself as well as assistance from her glam squad. “Not just a gown, a piece of poetry,” she wrote in the post's caption . “Thank you @dolcegabbana for the magic you made.” Lauren Sánchez's Versace Dress MEGA After exchanging vows in lace, Sánchez later wowed wedding guests in a rose pink Atelier Versace gown, custom-designed by Donatella Versace herself for the final wedding party. The ethereal silk chiffon dress featured delicate pleats and a corseted bodice adorned with rose gold, bronze, and gold Swarovski crystals. It was a shimmering statement of opulence, paired with a jewel-encrusted black clutch bag emblazoned with “Mrs. Bezos” in dazzling diamonds, solidifying her new status in true style. The Venice wedding hosted A-listers galore, including Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, and the Kardashians, who watched as Sánchez and Bezos took their first steps into forever. Kim Kardashian Reviews Sánchez And Jeff Bezos's Wedding Instagram Story | Kim Kardashian Kim Kardashian had nothing but glowing words for her friend Lauren Sánchez following her lavish wedding to Bezos. Taking to her Instagram Stories page, Kim shared her reaction . She posted a photo of Sánchez from her Vogue bridal shoot, writing, “LEGENDARY.” In the next slide, featuring Sánchez in her wedding gown, Kim gushed, “What a beautiful bride you are @laurensanchezbezos!!! We all cried watching you walk down the aisle in pure bliss!” Reflecting on the enchanting setting, she added, “The forest where you got married was magical but the love we all felt in the room is what we will never forget and why we all love and support you both so much!” Kim ended her tribute with heartfelt support, saying, “Forever rooting for the happiest couple! You deserve it all.”"

""I think it's unfair to bill Carolyn Bessette Kennedy an abject minimalist. Her style was austere at points, but in a really purposeful, kind of weird way (I say as the utmost compliment). The ensemble with the classic white shirt tucked into the ruffled Yohji skirt epitomizes her manner of dressing, at least from my view as an outsider. The quiet power of this look has gone on to shape so many collections to this day — just look at this one in The Row's latest lookbook. I'm certain it will make it into the show, but I worry about execution; the details are so important. Her shirt feels crisp but slightly mussed, wrapped instead of buttoned. The Yohji Yamamoto skirt has a perfectly odd mermaid silhouette. All of this — down to the chain-link gold purse — must be considered.

Fendi reintroduced their iconic Spy Bag on Thursday with a cinematic digital campaign starring Amelia Gray, Xiao Wen Ju, and Gabbriette. The 30-second video, photographed and directed by Stevie Dance and styled by Anna Trevelyan, follows the storyline of an underground collector tracking down the coveted accessory. The original Spy Bag was launched by Silvia Venturini Fendi in 2005 and quickly became a defining accessory of the 2000s. The signature design now returns, 20 years after its original release. Spy Bags, both original and new, feature a plush silhouette, twisted handles, and secret compartments that offer privacy in style. The new iteration boasts a few contemporary updates that brings the feeling of Y2K to 2025. Donatella Versace, who announced she would be stepping down from her position as Chief Creative Officer early this spring, launched her final ad campaign this week, starring veteran muses Kate Moss, Kristen McMenamy, Amber Valletta, Natasha Poly, and Claudia Schiffer, as well as newer faces like Anok Yai and Mica Argañaraz. The images and retro video clip feature Donatella's final Fall 2025 collection, and was shot by long-time collaborators Mert & Marcus. Former Miu Miu creative director Dario Vitale will succeed Donatella and stage his debut Versace show in September. The campaign symbolized a passing of the torch to Vitale, honoring the Versace of the past while also celebrating what's to come. “It was all about friendship, loyalty, and love. Every collection is a story, and this campaign is the story of Versace. Inspiring the present and anticipating the future,” Donatella said in a statement. Last week, Zimmermann's Cruise 2026 ready-to-wear Twisted Romance collection hit the streets of Mykonos for a corresponding digital runway show. This adventurous, pirate-inspired collection featured colorful stripes, dramatic corsets, voluminous sleeves, and billowing skirts. The vintage-inspired nautical designs looked at home on the cobblestone alleyways of the island, while the sea breeze showcased the water-like movement of the silk georgette. This isn't the first trip to Mykonos for the Australian brand. Zimmermann opened a boutique there in May and christened it with an exclusive “Dinner at Sea” on June 16. On Tuesday, The National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne announced Westwood | Kawakubo, a major new exhibition featuring over 140 designs by fashion icons Vivienne Westwood and Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons. The exhibit, opening with NGV's annual gala on December 6, marks the first time the work of these two designers will be shown together in a dedicated exhibition. The show will highlight key similarities and differences in the work of the two self-taught designers. Nearly 100 pieces have been drawn from the NGV Collection, alongside loans from major international institutions including the Met, Victoria & Albert Museum, Palais Galliera, and the Vivienne Westwood archive. The exhibition also includes over 40 recent Comme des Garçons works gifted to the NGV for this project. Westwood | Kawakubo continues NGV's history of major fashion exhibitions, following previous shows on Gabrielle Chanel, Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, and Jean Paul Gaultier. Gucci officially named dancer, singer, and songwriter Lee Know, of the K-pop group Stray Kids, as its newest Global Brand Ambassador on Monday. Regarding his new role, he shared in a press release, “I believe Gucci is a brand that transcends the past and present through heritage and contemporary creativity. It's a great honor to be part of Gucci's visionary journey.” He has long incorporated the brand's designs into his personal style and has attended numerous Gucci events prior to the official partnership announcement, including the Cruise 2025 fashion show in London last year. As a Global Brand Ambassador, Know is set to participate in future events, campaigns, and initiatives for Gucci, joining other notable ambassadors like Robert Pattinson, Kendall Jenner, and Dakota Johnson. Bottega Veneta announced Italian tennis champion Lorenzo Musetti's new ambassadorship this week, following his participation in the house's recent 'Craft is our Language' campaign. The campaign celebrated 50 years of their signature Intrecciato weave handbags and accessories. He joined fellow Bottega Veneta ambassadors such as Tyler, the Creator, Jack Antonoff, Lauren Hutton, and Julianne Moore to highlight the importance of hand language in craftsmanship and art. Lorenzo's feature focused on the beauty of the hand motions used in tennis. Musetti was ranked No. 6 in the Association of Tennis Professionals singles rankings in 2025, reaching the semifinals of both the 2024 Wimbledon Championships and the 2025 French Open. Representing Italy, he won bronze in men's singles at the 2024 Paris Olympics and led the Italian national team to victory in the 2023 and 2024 Davis Cup championship."

Together, a union of transcendent forces, fortified by their unwavering conviction and strength. ""The energy on this campaign was extraordinary. It was all about friendship, loyalty, and love.

Sinuous and sculpted, like liquid gold, casting light on Versace's rule-breaking sensuality and innovation.

A rounded, semi-circular top-handle style, speaking to Versace's inherent tensions; embodying the Versace woman's unyielding embracing of hard and soft. The campaign, captured by long-standing collaborators Mert and Marcus, is a definitive culmination of Donatella Versace's unparalleled vision, reaffirming the indelible legacy of the House while igniting the path forward. It stands as a proud celebration of Versace's uncompromising spirit, empowering unapologetic self-expression on the cusp of an exhilarating new chapter.

After ten years on the force, LAPD cop Sonny Rush relocates with her elderly mother to peaceful Haven, California, to join her godfather's burgeoning PI business. What crimes could possibly happen in a town nicknamed “Mayberry by the Sea”? Sonny's first case: find Figgy, a missing goldendoodle last seen sporting a Versace collar. At least scouting out a dognapper gives Sonny a chance to get to know her new neighbors. Forty-eight hours in town and Figgy's disappearance entangles Sonny in an unwelcome reunion with her ex, one of Haven's wealthiest citizens. And when the body of a teenage boy is found along a popular hiking trail, Sonny is drawn into a web of strange beyond anything she ever saw in LA. Then comes a local's warning: question everything. Haven hides secrets that could destroy its idyllic facade. Or destroy Sonny first. —— QOTD: Just for funsies!

Muchas personas usan el término “perfume” para referirse a cualquier fragancia, pero no todas tienen la misma concentración ni duración. Las diferencias entre un perfume, un eau de parfum y un eau de toilette no solo radican en su nombre, sino también en su composición, intensidad y uso recomendado. Conocer estas variaciones es clave para elegir la opción más adecuada según el estilo de vida, el clima y el presupuesto. En el mercado mexicano, existe una amplia oferta que incluye desde marcas internacionales de alta gama hasta opciones accesibles y funcionales. Cada formato tiene sus ventajas dependiendo del contexto: si se busca una fragancia duradera para un evento especial, o algo más fresco y liviano para el día a día. Comprender estas diferencias ayuda a evitar errores comunes, cómo comprar una fragancia demasiado intensa para el uso diario. Este artículo detalla las particularidades de cada tipo de producto, presenta ejemplos representativos y ofrece recomendaciones prácticas para encontrar la fragancia ideal, ya sea de firmas de lujo o de marcas populares como los perfumes Aeropostale, Calvin Klein, Zara o Tous. Diferencias fundamentales entre las concentraciones Cada tipo de fragancia tiene una formulación distinta que influye directamente en su duración y proyección. ¿Qué es un perfume? El perfume o extrait de parfum es el formato más concentrado. Su contenido de aceites esenciales suele estar entre el 20 % y el 30 %, lo que le confiere una duración prolongada, a veces superior a 12 horas en la piel. Este tipo de fragancia es más costosa, pero también más persistente y sofisticada. Ejemplos comunes de perfumes concentrados incluyen Chanel No. 5 Extrait, Dior J'adore L'Absolu o Amouage Interlude Woman. Por su intensidad, se recomienda aplicarlos con moderación y reservarlos para eventos especiales o climas fríos, donde pueden desplegar todo su potencial sin resultar abrumadores. ¿Qué es un eau de parfum? El eau de parfum (EDP) es uno de los formatos más populares por su equilibrio entre duración y precio. Su concentración oscila entre el 15 % y el 20 %, lo que permite una fijación duradera de 6 a 8 horas, dependiendo del tipo de piel y las condiciones ambientales. Marcas como Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Carolina Herrera Good Girl, Montblanc Signature o los perfumes Aeropostale en su versión EDP son buenos ejemplos de esta categoría. Estas fragancias son ideales para el uso diario en ambientes cerrados o para quienes desean un aroma que permanezca durante toda la jornada. ¿Qué es un eau de toilette? El eau de toilette (EDT) contiene entre un 5 % y un 15 % de aceites aromáticos. Esto la convierte en una opción más ligera, con una duración que va de 3 a 5 horas. Es perfecta para climas cálidos, momentos casuales o como fragancia de reaplicación a lo largo del día. Algunos EDT populares son CK One, Versace Pour Femme Dylan Blue, Tous Touch o Light Blue de Dolce & Gabbana en su versión ligera. Son recomendables para quienes prefieren aromas sutiles y frescos que no invadan el espacio personal. Aplicaciones prácticas según el estilo de vida Cada formato responde a un tipo de uso diferente, según la ocasión y la rutina personal. Fragancias para el trabajo y el día a día Para entornos laborales o actividades cotidianas, el eau de toilette suele ser la mejor elección. Su ligereza evita que el aroma resulte molesto para los demás, y su frescura aporta una sensación de limpieza. También es común reaplicar este tipo de fragancia a lo largo del día sin saturar. Marcas como Zara, Burberry Weekend, Benetton Colors, o los perfumes Aeropostale presentan opciones adecuadas para este perfil de uso, especialmente en oficinas o ambientes escolares. Fragancias para eventos especiales Cuando se necesita una fragancia más notoria y duradera, como en bodas, cenas o reuniones nocturnas, lo ideal es optar por un perfume o un buen eau de parfum. Estas versiones logran mayor permanencia y proyección, creando una estela más distintiva. Algunas recomendaciones incluyen Lancome La Vie Est Belle, Tom Ford Black Orchid, Mugler Alien o Elie Saab Le Parfum. Estos productos se comportan bien en pieles secas o en climas templados. Cómo identificar el tipo de concentración Es clave revisar la etiqueta y los detalles del envase antes de comprar una fragancia. Qué buscar en la botella o caja Los productos suelen indicar claramente si se trata de un perfume, eau de parfum o eau de toilette. Estas leyendas aparecen junto al nombre de la fragancia, por lo general en francés. En caso de duda, también se puede consultar el porcentaje de concentración en la lista de ingredientes. Además, algunas marcas ofrecen el mismo aroma en diferentes concentraciones. Por ejemplo, Chanel Coco Mademoiselle tiene versiones tanto EDP cómo EDT, cada una con una estructura olfativa ligeramente distinta, pero fiel al ADN del perfume. Consideraciones al comprar en línea Cuando se adquiere una fragancia por internet, especialmente en tiendas mexicanas como Liverpool, Sears, Sanborns o Amazon México, es fundamental verificar la descripción del producto...."

n17ylw6,2025-07-04 00:01:28,en,REDDIT,"  Well, as you should know, a large fraction--but not majority--of people here purchase luxury handbags associated with Houses that have been in the industry for a *long* time. Your brand, unfortunately, won't reach a cult following any time soon; it takes decades to build and maintain that. So I would recommend you *not* rely on logo hardware or monograms of any sort. Every brand has a ""story"". It's a marketing tactic. I recommend you come up with one, and it doesn't have to be 100% true. You are welcome to embellish. You'd be surprised what a story can do. Chanel was a dying brand until Karl Lagerfeld took over. He reinvented the lore for the dying house and made Coco Chanel seem like the pinnacle of upper class from rags to riches (while simultaneously hiding her Nazi connections). What he did for the brand is immeasurable. Anyway, yeah, a good story always helps. Pick out your niche. What differentiates you from ""other"" handbag brands? Every brand is known for *something* . I wouldn't recommend going for ""all our pieces are unique and handcrafted by the finest artisans"" or ""made with the higest quality leathers"" as that has been over done and means very little to those actually into handbags. You need to pick a group--like age range and social economic status--you wish to appeal to. Have a distinct House code/style. You want to stick out. Having themes in your collection or iconic prints will help people recognise your product from afar. Think Chanel's quilted pattern, Burberry's Nova Check print, Versace's embellishments and safety pins, etc. All these repeat features help create world building, as we call it in the fashion world. Also, social media. I can't stress that enough."

Trong khi khách mời có được những bức ảnh sang trọng, người ngoài nhìn vào lại cảm nhận sự xa hoa lạc lõng. Tại Venice, nhiều cư dân và nhóm bảo vệ môi trường xuống đường phản đối, cho rằng đám cưới là biểu tượng cho sự thương mại hóa thái quá của một thành phố đang chịu ảnh hưởng nặng nề bởi biến đổi khí hậu và du lịch ồ ạt.

Đội ngũ phục vụ buộc ký cam kết bảo mật, còn lực lượng vệ sĩ được bố trí dày đặc. Ban đầu, cặp đôi dự định tổ chức tại Scuola Grande della Misericordia. Tuy nhiên, do dư luận phản đối, họ chuyển sang Arsenale Di Venezia. Đây là một địa điểm kín đáo, được bao quanh bởi hào nước và cầu kéo. Theo nhà báo văn hóa Louis Pisano, đám cưới này gợi nhớ hôn lễ hoành tráng năm 2014 của Kim Kardashian và Kanye West, với các bữa tiệc xa hoa, màn biểu diễn của Mateo Bocelli - con trai Andrea Bocelli, người từng hát tại lễ cưới nhà Kardashian. Tuy nhiên, khác với đám cưới Kim-Kanye được khán giả đồng cảm nhờ câu chuyện được kể qua truyền hình, lễ cưới của Bezos bị nhận xét thiếu chiều sâu, khách mời “ngẫu nhiên và mang tính giao dịch”. Nhiều TikToker đặt câu hỏi liệu nữ diễn viên Sydney Sweeney có thật sự quen cặp đôi. Leonardo DiCaprio bị chỉ trích vì dự lễ cưới “phát thải carbon” trái ngược tuyên bố bảo vệ môi trường của anh. Bình luận viên Blakely Thornton gọi các khách mời là “những kẻ thất bại xác nhận” khi tìm kiếm sự hào nhoáng. Hình ảnh đối lập Pisano cho rằng số tiền tổ chức đám cưới này có thể đủ để chi trả cho 1.500 đám cưới trung bình ở Mỹ. Trong khi nhiều cặp đôi đang chật vật vì khủng hoảng kinh tế, sự xa hoa này càng khó nhận được sự cảm thông, nhất là khi xu hướng cưới hiện nay ưu tiên quy mô nhỏ, ý nghĩa. Hình ảnh Bezos - Sánchez vẫy tay, hôn gió trên chiếc canô sang trọng, đối lập với cảnh người dân Venice biểu tình bên bờ kênh, càng làm rõ khoảng cách giữa siêu giàu và phần còn lại. Dù Bezos đã quyên góp cho một số quỹ địa phương, Pisano cho rằng: “Khi một trong những người giàu nhất thế giới đến một trong những thành phố khó khăn nhất, điều đó không giúp họ tạo được thiện cảm”. Trang phục cô dâu cũng gây chú ý. Lauren Sánchez thay nhiều bộ đồ trong suốt sự kiện, nổi bật nhất là váy cưới hiệu Dolce & Gabbana cổ cao với 180 khuy bọc lụa, lấy cảm hứng từ minh tinh Sophia Loren. Theo tạp chí Vogue, thiết kế này là bước chuyển lớn so với phong cách gợi cảm thường thấy của Sánchez, khiến hình ảnh trông thiếu tự nhiên. Lễ cưới của Bezos được ca ngợi là một trong những sự kiện xa hoa nhất châu Âu năm 2025. Ảnh: Reuters. Nhà thiết kế Donatella Versace, người nổi tiếng ủng hộ cộng đồng LGBTQ+, cũng chuẩn bị một bộ trang phục khác cho cô dâu, dù Amazon, công ty của Bezos, từng bị chỉ trích vì hạn chế chính sách đa dạng, hòa nhập. Trước những phản ứng trái chiều, nhiều ý kiến cho rằng đám cưới của Bezos không chỉ phô bày sự giàu sang. Nó còn cho thấy ranh giới ngày càng rõ giữa giới siêu giàu và phần còn lại của xã hội, đặc biệt khi Venice đang phải vật lộn với tình trạng du lịch quá tải và nước biển dâng. Dù vậy, đám cưới của Bezos chưa phải xa xỉ nhất. Kỷ lục thuộc về Anant Ambani, con trai tỷ phú Ấn Độ Mukesh Ambani, với đám cưới 100 triệu USD kéo dài một tuần, diễn ra ngay bên cạnh các khu ổ chuột lớn nhất Mumbai, hình ảnh đối lập gây nhiều tranh cãi. Hong Kong (Trung Quốc) cũng từng chứng kiến những đám cưới xa hoa, nhưng không phải cái kết nào cũng viên mãn.

mov_1B961FE19F4BCC69062CA6E25E5EAA5D,2025-07-04 03:30:40,vi,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Ngày 3/7, TAND TP.Huế (tỉnh Thừa Thiên - Huế) mở phiên tòa xét xử đối với các bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương (SN 1992); Phạm Thanh Long (SN 1992) cùng vợ là Nguyễn Thu Trinh (SN 1992, cùng ngụ P.Xuân Phú, TP.Huế) về tội Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản. Công lý dẫn cáo trạng của VKSND TP.Huế, đầu năm 2021, Lê Thị Hồng Phương bắt đầu kinh doanh online các mặt hàng cao cấp như thực phẩm chức năng, mỹ phẩm, túi xách, nước hoa, đồng hồ... từ các thương hiệu nổi tiếng như Hermes, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Versace... Để có vốn mở rộng quy mô kinh doanh, từ tháng 3/2021, Phương kêu gọi vợ chồng Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh cùng góp vốn đầu tư. Cả ba lập nhóm chat “KIM MONOLOLY GROUP” trên ứng dụng Viber để giao dịch. Phương tự lập các đơn hàng, ghi rõ ngày đi - ngày về và mức lãi suất cao (từ 10% đến 100%) để kêu gọi vốn từ Long, Trinh và những người thân quen của họ. Mỗi đơn hàng có giá trị từ 10 triệu đồng đến hơn 4 tỷ đồng. Việc góp vốn diễn ra suôn sẻ, lợi nhuận cao khiến nhiều người tiếp tục tham gia. Vợ chồng Long và Trinh còn hạ mức lãi suất cho các nhà đầu tư cấp dưới để hưởng chênh lệch từ mức lãi suất mà Phương cam kết. Tuy nhiên, sau một thời gian, hoạt động kinh doanh thua lỗ, hàng hóa không tiêu thụ được khiến Phương mất khả năng chi trả. Để tiếp tục duy trì dòng tiền và trả lãi cho các đơn cũ, Phương lập các đơn hàng giả với lãi suất cao để lôi kéo nhà đầu tư mới, thực chất là chiếm đoạt tiền. Các bị cáo tại phiên tòa. (Ảnh: Báo Công an TP.HCM) Từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, Phương đã huy động vốn thông qua 1.158 đơn hàng, nhận tổng cộng 505,16 tỷ đồng, đã tất toán 990 đơn hàng với lãi suất hơn 91,39 tỷ đồng. Còn lại 168 đơn hàng chưa tất toán, tương ứng 112,3 tỷ đồng. Sau khi trừ phần lãi đã trả, số tiền Phương chiếm đoạt thực tế là 20,3 tỷ đồng. Số tiền này được Phương sử dụng vào các mục đích cá nhân như thuê nhà, thuê kho bãi, vận chuyển hàng hóa, xoay vòng dòng tiền và tiêu xài. Đến ngày 12/4/2022, Phương chính thức tuyên bố mất khả năng thanh toán. Riêng đối với Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh, quá trình điều tra cho thấy, từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, hai bị cáo này sử dụng tiền cá nhân, tiền của người thân và tiền của các nhà đầu tư để đầu tư cho Phương. Đáng chú ý, ngay trước thời điểm Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ, ngày 12/4/2022, Phương vẫn gửi 12 đơn hàng với lãi suất từ 6% đến 25% để Long và Trinh tiếp tục huy động vốn. Ba người đầu tư là anh Nguyễn Tiến Phương 500 triệu đồng, chị Ngô Thị Diệu Lý 850 triệu đồng và anh Trần Hùng 794 triệu đồng. Cuối năm 2022, Cơ quan CSĐT Công an tỉnh Thừa Thiên Huế (nay là TP Huế) khởi tố bị can, bắt giữ các đối tượng. Theo tin tức trên báo Công an TP.HCM, sau khi nghị án, HĐXX tuyên phạt Lê Thị Hồng Phương 14 năm tù về tội “Lừa đảo chiếm đoạt tài sản”; Phạm Thanh Long 5 năm tù và Nguyễn Thu Trinh 3 năm 6 tháng tù về tội “Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản”.

mov_CE3F8654531044F79BD935BCF817561D,2025-07-04 05:29:10,en,WEB,"  Two boys charged with a stabbing murder might have been hired for the hit before targeting the wrong man in a case police have labelled ""disorganised crime"". Luke Manassa was stabbed outside a house in Pemulwuy in Sydney's west on June 26 by two masked assailants armed with machetes who were lying in wait in the driveway. Mr Manassa tried to escape to his ute and drive away but only travelled a few hundred metres before being overcome by his injuries and dying at the scene. Two teenagers, aged 16 and 17, were due to face a children's court charged with murder on Friday. The pair were arrested on Thursday morning but cannot be identified due to their age. The 17-year-old was on bail when Mr Manassa was killed. Detective Superintendent Joseph Doueihi said the teens were known to police for past violent behaviour and association with street gangs. ""We believe that these younger offenders were contracted by someone to conduct this killing,"" Det Supt Doueihi told reporters. But there was no evidence linking Mr Manassa's alleged killers to the wider spate of organised crime violence in Sydney. ""It's a very amateurish offence by these offenders,"" Det Supt Doueihi said. ""If anything, I'd call it disorganised crime."" Mr Manassa's family are adamant he was not the intended victim and police confirmed he was not known to authorities prior to his death. He did not live at the house he arrived at when he was stabbed but visited there occasionally. ""The occupants of that location are known to Luke and are also known to NSW Police,"" Det Supt Doueihi said. Police have seized a red Kia the teens allegedly used to flee the scene. The pair are the latest in a string of young people allegedly caught up in Sydney's organised crime wave. On Wednesday, two 15-year-old boys were charged over two shootings in Sydney's southwest in June, one of which also involved a potential case of mistaken identity. ""The problem is that these young children don't understand the consequences of their actions,"" Det Supt Doueihi said. ""They could end up dead themselves, or they could be victims of some form of retaliation by the people that they tried to target."" The killing of plumber John Versace at Condell Park in May was another high-profile case of suspected mistaken identity."

Under the title “A Celebration of Freedom, Strength, Power.” The Fall-Winter 2025 campaign highlights the fashion house's ongoing emphasis on individuality and rule-breaking confidence, with a focus on female strength, attitude and heart. It features a notable line-up of iconic faces from the industry, including Claudia Schiffer, Kate Moss, Kristen McMenamy, Amber Valletta, Natasha Poly, Saskia de Brauw, Liu Wen, Mica Argañaraz, Anok Yai, Mila Van Eeten and Jacqui Hooper. Photographers and directors Mert and Marcus, long-time collaborators with the House, were behind the visuals. According to Donatella Versace, the campaign was driven by energy and friendship. “The energy on this campaign was extraordinary. It was all about friendship, loyalty, and love. These images were created to celebrate the soul of the Versace woman. Her strength, her spirit, her attitude, and her heart. Every collection is a story, and this campaign is the story of Versace. Inspiring the present and anticipating the future,” she said. The campaign bridges elements of the Fall-Winter 2025 collection and iconic archival designs. It features definitive Versace silhouettes alongside signature metallic mesh fabrics. The new Virtus bag is central to the collection's identity, incorporating a bold V-emblem formed from metal and a semi-circular top handle, intended to echo the tension and duality within the Versace woman. Stylist Jacob K helped to create the campaign's aesthetic, with Lucia Pieroni handling makeup artistry and Paul Hanlon responsible for hair styling. Versace stated that the collection and campaign aim to showcase the merging of hard and soft, strength and sensuality. The designs continue the brand's tradition of blending boldness with innovation, while remaining anchored in its signature codes. With this campaign, Versace reasserts its commitment to empowering women and celebrating authentic self-expression. It also marks a new chapter for the House, which continues to build on its legacy while looking firmly to the future. versace.com The post appeared first on A&E Magazine ."

Според италианското издание Corriere della Sera, тоалет от впечатляващата сватбена колекция на Санчес липсва. Макар сред местните да се шушука, че роклята може да е открадната, до момента няма подаден сигнал или започнато разследване по случая. Все още не е ясно коя точно от зашеметяващите рокли на Санчес се е „изпарила“, но според Daily Mail най-ценната ѝ рокля – уникалната дантелена Dolce & Gabbana, с която тя мина под венчило, е в безопасност. Този впечатляващ модел е вдъхновен от визията на София Лорен в култовия филм ""Houseboat"" от 1958 г., където тя се омъжва за Кари Грант. Роклята на Санчес впечатли с дълги ръкави, корсетен силует, висока яка и типична „русалка“ пола. Отпред бяха зашити 180 копчета – стилно подчертаване на уникалния дизайн. As a devoted fan of both Sophia Loren and Dolce & Gabbana, I'm absolutely thrilled with this beautiful nod to la Dolce Vita It added a refined touch to the Bezos-Sanchez wedding, recalling that iconic image from the 1958 film Houseboat with Cary Grant and Sophia Loren Bravo! pic.twitter.com/53LauslVnF — Mambo Italiano (@mamboitaliano__) June 27, 2025 „Първоначално исках нещо модерно, изчистено и секси, а накрая се спрях на тоалет, който носи духа на момента и показва къде съм днес. Аз съм различна жена от тази преди пет години“, сподели новата госпожа Безос пред Vogue. „Това е голяма промяна спрямо очакванията – обикновено нося рокли с открити рамене или с дълбоки деколтета“, допълва 55-годишната бивша телевизионна водеща. Седмицата на сватбата премина с истински моден маратон: Лорън Санчес впечатли гостите на двете празнични вечери с винтидж рокля Alexander McQueen, декорирана с копчета, както и с флорална haute couture рокля на Schiaparelli. На самия сватбен ден тя се появи първо с бял костюм Dior и копринен шал Hermès, преди да облече булчинската рокля за церемонията.

A proposito proprio di vestiti: la sposa non si è certo limitata. Ha anzi portato con sé ben 27 abiti, da sfoggiare nell'arco dei tre giorni di sfarzosissimi e lussuosi festeggiamenti. Si è rivolta a diverse importanti Maison e come lei anche gli invitati. Tutto questo ha creato un certo movimento nel mondo della moda. Gli abiti del matrimonio di Lauren Sanchez e Jeff Bezos La sposa nel fatidico giorno del sì ha scelto una creazione firmata Dolce&Gabbana: un abito a sirena ispirato a Sofia Loren, in omaggio proprio all'Italia, che ha ospitato le nozze (e anche la luna di miele visto che ora i neo sposi sono in Sicilia). Tra gli altri brand a cui si è affidata: Alexander McQueen (il monospalla del primo giorno), Schiaparelli (un capo d'Alta Moda da circa 100mila euro), Alaia, Dior, Versace. Non sono mancati gli imprevisti: pare infatti che un vestito sia scomparso, forse rubato. E che dire dei look degli invitati. La guest list, top secret fino all'ultimo, includeva ospiti provenienti da ogni parte del mondo. C'erano Vittoria Ceretti con Leonardo Di Caprio, la regina Rania di Giordania, Kylie e Kendall Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Sydney Sweeney. Proprio l'attrice ha riscosso particolare successo coi suoi outfit. Lauren Sànchez in Schiaparelli Haute Couture Quali brand hanno guadagnato di più dalle nozze Secondo un report di Launchmetrics riportato da WWD, il matrimonio dell'imprenditore (fondatore e proprietario di Amazon) e della giornalista avrebbe prodotto ben 222 milioni di dollari di Media Impact Value (MIV). Sul fronte moda, pare ne abbia beneficiato soprattutto Dolce&Gabbana (avendo firmato l'abito bianco): si parla di una visibilità mediatica del valore di 14,5 milioni di dollari e di un incremento del 28% in quanto a esposizione mediatica nei giorni dell'evento. Il brand, tra l'altro, non ha vestito solo la sposa ma anche alcuni invitati: Vittoria Ceretti, Kylie Jenner, Sydney Sweeney.

On July 4, 1999, Victoria married soccer star David Beckham at the Luttrellstown Castle near Dublin. While David wore a chic white suit, Victoria opted for a stunning champagne ball gown made by iconic bridal designer Vera Wang. The silk pleated dress featured a 20-foot train and a sculpted, strapless neckline. To top off the look, Victoria accessorized the ensemble with an 18-karat gold tiara by jewelry designer Slim Barrett. Although the couple later ditched their white ceremony outfits in favor of matching purple getups for their reception, Victoria's wedding dress remains one of the most iconic staples from their lavish wedding and in her fashion lookbook as a whole. From details on the tiara to how that cinched bodice was made, here's everything to know about Victoria Beckham's wedding dress. The corset was made by Mister Pearl David Beckham and Victoria Beckham on their wedding day. David Beckham/Instagram One of couture's most celebrated corsetieres, Mister Pearl designed the underbodice for Victoria's wedding dress, which helped augment the structural top half of her ensemble. “The actual underbodice was made by a very famous couture corsetiere named Mister Pearl, who works only out of London,” Wang told PEOPLE in 2023. “He makes corsets that have to be pulled [in] with these metal things, which is how corsets were done in the old days.” Mister Pearl has worked with a slew of designers throughout his career, including Thierry Mugler and Vivienne Westwood. He also famously created Kim Kardashian's cinched corset for her iconic 2019 Met Gala look. The fashion entrepreneur joked in a red carpet interview with Vogue that she wasn't sure if she could take a “deep breath” while wearing the staple piece. “It takes about 45 minutes to lace up,” Wang added of Mister Pearl's unique corsets. “And it can take your waist down to literally 18 inches [like] Scarlett O'Hara.” The gown flew across the Atlantic four times David and Victoria Beckham during their wedding in 1999. Victoria Beckham/ Instagram Since Mister Pearl exclusively works out of England, Victoria's dress — specifically its sculpted bodice — had to fly back and forth between New York City and London. “I call it the transatlantic dress,” Wang told PEOPLE, adding that the bodice had to fly four times across the pond. Wang flew out to London to help fit the corset onto Victoria, and the former Spice Girl also had to visit New York twice for more fittings. Things took a pause, however, when Victoria became pregnant with her and David's firstborn, Brooklyn. “So then we delayed the wedding for two years,” Wang said. “Then we resumed, or maybe a year and a half. So that is [what] I call the transatlantic wedding with Victoria and David.” The designer also fondly remembered a baby Brooklyn “crawling around on the bed in London” during the fittings. Her tiara was decorated with brilliant-cut diamonds David Beckham and Victoria Adams Beckham hug on their wedding day. David Backham/ Instagram Victoria topped off her bridal ensemble with an iconic staple piece — an 18-karat gold tiara. To create the gorgeous headpiece, the Spice World star tapped jewelry designer Slim Barrett, who has collaborated with fashion houses like Chanel and Versace throughout his career and designed pieces for Mick Jagger and Princess Diana. The tiara, named the “East of Paris,” was made from 18-carat latticed gold and adorned with brilliant-cut diamonds and suspended diamond drops. After the wedding, Barrett kept the crown, and it was later displayed at the Victoria and Albert Museum in London for its 100 Tiaras, Past and Present show. Barrett eventually put up the tiara for auction in 2013 at Bonhams in London, where it was valued between 18,000 and 25,000 pounds. “Inspiration for East of Paris came from my love of Eastern design and Parisian haute couture,” Barrett told British Vogue at the time. “I set out to fuse the two styles.” Victoria still has her wedding dress David Beckham and Victoria Adams Beckham on their wedding day. David Beckham/ Instagram Years after their wedding, Victoria has held onto her gown. In a 2018 video for British Vogue, the fashion designer whipped out the wedding dress to honor her brand's 10th anniversary and to celebrate her life in looks. “Today we're here at Vogue and we are shooting a cover story celebrating the rich and inspiring history of one of the most enduring style icons of all time … me, Victoria Beckham,” she joked at the start of the video...."

Този впечатляващ модел е вдъхновен от визията на София Лорен в култовия филм ""Houseboat"" от 1958 г., където тя се омъжва за Кари Грант. Роклята на Санчес впечатли с дълги ръкави, корсетен силует, висока яка и типична „русалка“ пола. Отпред бяха зашити 180 копчета – стилно подчертаване на уникалния дизайн.

Forty-eight hours in town and Figgy's disappearance entangles Sonny in an unwelcome reunion with her ex, one of Haven's wealthiest citizens. And when the body of a teenage boy is found along a popular hiking trail, Sonny is drawn into a web of strange beyond anything she ever saw in LA. Then comes a local's warning: question everything.

Nu se știe exact care anume dintre rochiile de designer a dispărut, dar este cert că nu era rochia albă din dantelă pe care Lauren, în vârstă de 55 de ani, a purtat-o pentru a se căsători cu fondatorul Amazon, în vârstă de 61 de ani. Miliardarul și fosta jurnalistă s-au căsătorit pe insula San Giorgio Maggiore, în fața unei mulțimi de oaspeți, majoritatea vedete. La câteva momente după ce a spus „Da,” mireasa a postat pe Instagram, împărtășind o fotografie cu ea și Jeff împreună, pe care a subtitrat-o cu data evenimentului. În imagine, Lauren „strălucea” în uimitoarea rochie de mireasă, cu mâneci florale din dantelă, un corset strâmt, un decolteu înalt, o fustă lungă cu o trenă enormă și nasturi în față.

Foto: Profimedia Ce le-a povestit Lauren Sanchez reporterilor de la Vogue Pe lângă acestea, înainte de nuntă, Lauren a pozat în rochia de mireasă pentru o ședință foto cu revista Vogue. În timp ce discuta cu reporterii de la Vogue, Lauren și-a amintit că s-a simțit ca o „prințesă” în timpul probei rochiei, care a avut loc la Milano, Italia. „A fost o senzație mai puternică decât credeam”, a adăugat ea, vorbind despre momentul în care a îmbrăcat rochia pentru prima dată. Ea a dezvăluit, de asemenea, că Jeff Bezos a implorat-o să o vadă în rochie, dar, așa cum este tradiția pentru majoritatea mireselor, ea a explicat că nu îl va lăsa să dea cu ochii pe ea până în ziua cea mare. „Aproape că am cedat”, a recunoscut ea. „Dar vreau să fie o surpriză. Pe măsură ce îmbătrânești, nu te mai surprind multe lucruri. Abia aștept să-i văd fața”. Fotografii artistice pe un fundal de lux decadent Doar o oră mai târziu, Lauren a mai publicat câteva fotografii din culise cu rochia ei de mireasă făcute de Nicolas Geradin. Într-o postare de carusel, fosta jurnalistă era fotografiată într-o cameră de un lux decadent din Veneția, purtând rochia din dantelă cu gât înalt și arătând o siluetă dramatică. A doua fotografie, o imagine alb-negru, o arăta pe Lauren și echipa ei ajutând-o să intre în rochie, în timp ce a treia imagine îl arăta pe designerul Domenico Dolce așezându-i miresei voalul de dantelă pe cap. „Nu e doar o rochie, e o poezie”, a scris Lauren în legenda postării. „Mulțumesc @dolcegabbana pentru magia pe care ai făcut-o”. Mai târziu, Lauren a orbit mulțimea apărând într-o rochie Atelier Versace roz plisată, creată de Donatella Versace însăși, la petrecerea finală de nuntă. Spectaculoasa rochie de bal era confecționată din șifon de mătase și avea un corset brodat manual cu o serie de cristale Swarovski din aur roz, bronz și aur. Fosta jurnalistă a asortat acest look cu o geantă neagră încrustată cu bijuterii pe care scria: „Doamna Bezos” cu diamante transparente, un semn al noului său statut.

Ωστόσο, παραμένοντας παραδοσιακή η Σάντσες κρατήθηκε και δεν το αποκάλυψε, δηλώνοντας χαρακτηριστικά: «Σχεδόν υπέκυψα», ενώ πρόσθεσε: «Αλλά ήθελα να είναι έκπληξη. Όσο μεγαλώνεις, δεν υπάρχουν πολλές εκπλήξεις στη ζωή. Ανυπομονώ να δω το πρόσωπό του».

Sin embargo, hay una pista infalible para las amantes de la perfumería: el listado de los más vendidos de Amazon España. Allí, prácticamente a diario, se actualiza el ranking de colonias y perfumes que triunfan, y sí, los aromas dulces y los toques especiados siguen siendo los favoritos. Dentro de ese top 50 hay una fragancia que no pasa desapercibida y que se ha convertido en una de las joyas de la temporada: Eros de Versace. Este eau de toilette acumula nada menos que 18.000 valoraciones y una media de 4,6 estrellas, todo un síntoma de que su combinación de frescura, sensualidad y potencia funciona las 24 horas del día. Tengo más de 150 perfumes y este mi nuevo favorito para el verano: fresco, afrutado, tropical y de larga duración Una colonia que conecta con la esencia de la Antigua Grecia Eros de Versace, un favorito infalible dentro de nuestro país Lo que hace único a Eros es su capacidad de mezclar historia, seducción y frescura en un solo frasco. Esta fragancia masculina, lanzada en 2012, se inspira en la mitología griega y rinde homenaje al dios del amor, Eros, hijo de Afrodita. El propio frasco, tallado en cristal turquesa y coronado por la cabeza de Medusa, es toda una declaración de intenciones. Detrás de este aroma está el perfumista Aurélien Guichard, quien ha logrado encapsular el espíritu vibrante de Versace en un perfume con carácter propio. Las fanáticas de las colonias cítricas más frescas y aromáticas no tardarán en apreciar la combinación inicial de menta, manzana verde y limón, que se funden en un arranque chispeante y refrescante. Eros de Versace De hecho, el corazón de Eros apuesta por una mezcla moderna y sofisticada de haba tonka, ambroxan y geranio, aportando calidez sin renunciar a la frescura. El resultado es un perfume versátil, con ese toque fougère que lo hace tan masculino como atemporal. Su estela se completa con una base envolvente de vainilla de Madagascar, cedro de Virginia, vetiver y musgo de roble. En Amazon, acumula un total de 18.722 valoraciones y una nota excelente. Todo ello acompañado de halagos como ""aroma fresco nada cargante, duradero y sutil"". En cuanto al precio, Eros de Versace es una opción que, ahora mismo, se puede conseguir en Amazon por 43,40 euros en su formato de 50 ml, mientras que en la web oficial de Versace el mismo tamaño se vende por 86 euros. Paseando por Niza me pararon para preguntarme qué perfume llevaba: una colonia cítrica, fresca y chispeante que cumple 70 años Otras colonias que se cuelan entre las más vendidas en Amazon Gloria Vanderbilt N°1 Eau de Toilette Gloria Vanderbilt N°1 Eau de Toilette Esta fragancia, lanzada en 1982, mantiene su lugar en el ranking por méritos propios y por ser una de esas colonias frescas de mujer que son un éxito desde hace años. Creada por la prestigiosa nariz Sophia Grojsman, Vanderbilt es un perfume oriental floral que despliega un aroma inconfundible desde el primer instante. Su pirámide olfativa arranca con notas de aldehídos, flor de azahar, piña, lavanda y bergamota, aportando un frescor delicado y vibrante. El corazón floral, con jazmín, rosa, ylang-ylang, clavel y tuberosa, deja paso a un fondo cálido de vainilla, sándalo, canela y almizcle, generando una estela femenina y duradera. Perfecta para las amantes de los aromas clásicos con un toque vintage, esta fragancia sigue conquistando generaciones. Su precio es otro de sus grandes atractivos: en Amazon, los 100 ml de Gloria Vanderbilt N°1 cuestan 7,74 euros, mientras que en Clarel se encuentra por 9,99 euros.

And if the tournament made them famous, it also transformed their lives off the pitch. From lucrative brand ambassadorships with high-end fashion labels such as Gucci to turns on the red carpet in dresses worthy of a Kardashian, England's female footballers now enjoy more than a touch of glitz and glamour. Once badly paid and barely recognised – who could forget goalie Mary Earps complaining before the last Euros that Nike hadn't even bothered to print replica shirts with her name on them – the nation's female footballers now have a soaring commercial appeal. So as they prepare to face France at 8pm tonight in their first game of this year's Euros – and inspire a new generation of young women with their sporting prowess – Molly Clayton reveals which of our Lionesses enjoys the most luxurious lifestyle. The Gucci model Shoots for Vogue, GQ and Elle Magazine. Modelling for Calvin Klein. Gucci snapping her up as a brand ambassador. Clearly, as well as being an impressive England captain, Leah Williamson, 28, has a catwalk-worthy fashion career too. One of the biggest earners off the pitch after leading the Lionesses to victory at the Euro 2022 final, the blonde beauty has a deal with Nike and has collaborated with global brands such as Aston Martin, Pepsi, Walkers and Mastercard. With 1.1 million Instagram followers, she has new advert partnerships with Weetabix and Cadbury, along with six children's books, titled The Wonder Team. With the deals comes the gloss: her recent lavish Mallorcan holiday to an Ikos resort would have set her back in the region of £1,000 a night. She is rumoured to be dating former model and Miss USA Elle Smith – both have posted about each other on social media. Ella the business brainbox With her ever-present fake eyelashes and love of make-up, Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone, 25, often showcases her beauty routine on her own YouTube channel. And with a canny business acumen to boot, Ella has already shaped an enviable off-pitch career. The first England women's player to trademark her name, she's set up her own brand, ET7, which includes a football academy for young girls. The name is inspired by her childhood hero, Portuguese footballing superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, whose own brand is called CR7. With some estimating her worth at more than £1 million, last month she set up her own creative agency, Amicizia, which aims to connect female athletes to commercial and marketing opportunities with top brands. Her sponsors include make-up company Charlotte Tilbury, orthodontic brand Invisalign and McDonald's, with her yearly earnings estimated as upwards of £200,000, fuelled by her popularity on social media. At one point, she was one of the top five most viewed athletes on TikTok. Ella has 737,000 Instagram followers and her own BBC podcast with best friend and fellow Lioness Alessia Russo, with whom she has appeared on the front cover of fashion and beauty magazine Elle. Ella loves nothing more than a red carpet bash. In a relationship with footballer Joe Bunney of Stalybridge Celtic FC, she regularly treats her fans to glimpses of their lavish holidays abroad and spa days at five-star hotels. Lauren's ooh la la lego Proving that every passion can be profitable, Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp, 24, has topped up her estimated £400,000 salary with a sponsorship deal with Lego. Devoted to creating Lego masterpieces in her downtime, saying it's 'the best way to relax', she's even made the Mona Lisa out of the bricks. Her other sponsors include Nike and Sports Direct. Lauren also has the support of her girlfriend, former Liverpool midfielder Ashley Hodson. Together for two years, the pair recently enjoyed a romantic trip to Paris, where Lauren saw the Mona Lisa in her more traditional setting. Shy superstar with an ex on the team Growing up, Lucy Bronze lived on Lindisfarne – also known as Holy Island – off the windswept coast of Northumberland. Her grandmother was caretaker of Lindisfarne Castle and today the outline of that building is tattooed on Lucy's wrist. Shy into adulthood, she was diagnosed with ADHD and autism in 2021. But neither her isolated upbringing nor her neurodiversity held her back. Rather, she's said she uses the intense focus associated with her conditions to her advantage – and now the 33-year-old is one of the biggest earners in the game. She reportedly took home £200,000 a year while playing at Barcelona before her move to Chelsea in 2024. Big money deals followed her triumph at the last Euros, with Pepsi, EE, Klarna and Visa among her backers. Her former girlfriend is fellow Lioness Keira Walsh. Fashion week regular She earned almost £2 million in 2023 alone, according to Forbes magazine. That same year, Alessia Russo's transfer from Manchester United to Arsenal made her one of the most expensive female footballers on the planet. Her contract is said to be worth more than £500,000 a year and her commercial appeal is just as lucrative. She has deals with Gucci, Adidas, PlayStation, Beats by Dr Dre and last month was gifted an MGS5 EV car, which she proudly showed off on Instagram. A regular at London Fashion Week, Alessia, 26, has appeared on the cover of magazines such as Women's Health. The BAFTA TV Awards in May saw her in a £1,295 Roland Mouret dress, right. Revealing outfits... on pitch too! Hair scraped back and with braces on her teeth, Chloe Kelly scored that late winning goal against Germany at Wembley in 2022, famously taking off her top in celebration. Since then, she has revelled in her success with a glossy makeover...."

As part of the strategy, business   to govt meetings will be held in key global cities, including   New York, San Francisco,   Los Angeles, London, Paris, Frankfurt, Milan, Amsterdam, and Birmingham. €œThese events are being organised in collaboration with Indian embassies and leading   industry bodies, including   the USIBC, CII, and FICCI,�€ the spokeperson said. Officials concerned pointed   out that in the US, dialogues   will be held with companies   such as Google, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure,   Oracle, Equinix, Skechers,   Mattel, Ralph Lauren, and Coach. In Europe and the UK, efforts will focus on attracting   global giants like BMW, Bosch, BASF, Prada, Versace, Lego, Unilever, and GSK.

Tra queste ci sono anche Kylie e Kendall Jenner, le sorelle più famose e seguite d'America, che dopo aver presenziato alle nozze del fondatore di Amazon hanno deciso di concedersi qualche giorno di relax in Toscana. Kylie e Kendall Jenner hanno pubblicato sui loro profili Instagram scatti immersi nella natura senese. Vacanze in Toscana per Kylie e Kendall Jenner Se Bezos e la sua neo-sposa si sono spostati in Sicilia, nella splendida Taormina, per la luna di miele, altre star hanno scelto il cuore verde del nostro Paese per proseguire il loro soggiorno italiano. In particolare, le due sorelle Kylie e Kendall Jenner si stanno godendo giornate lontane dai riflettori e dal glamour, soggiornando in un resort esclusivo in Toscana. Le immagini condivise dalle due nei social raccontano di colazioni all'aperto, pranzi tipici, passeggiate tra i sentieri di campagna e momenti di relax e divertimento in piscina.  La meta prescelta dalle due imprenditrici e influencer è Borgo Santo Pietro, un resort cinque stelle immerso nella campagna senese, precisamente a Chiusdino. Borgo Santo Pietro, oltre a essere un hotel di lusso, è una tenuta agricola di 120 ettari, dove si producono miele, olio extravergine di oliva e verdure biologiche utilizzate nei ristoranti del resort. Questo relais di lusso che conta ventidue camere e suite, distribuite tra la villa principale e residenze indipendenti immerse nel verde. Qui ogni camera è pensata per offrire agli ospiti un'esperienza esclusiva in un contesto intimo e riservato, lontano da occhi indiscreti.  Con loro, in vacanza, ci sono anche i figli di Kylie, avuti dalla relazione con il rapper Travis Scott. Una scelta che conferma quanto la Toscana sia amata non solo per le sue città d'arte, ma anche per i paesaggi rurali e l'ottima cucina. Chi sono Kylie e Kendall Jenner Kylie e Kendall Jenner sono le sorelle minori di Kim Kardashian, imprenditrice che ideato nuovi brand nel settore beauty e moda.

E os rumores são verdadeiros: as peças de arquivo de marcas de luxo como Hermès, Louis Vuitton, Versace, Chanel e Dolce & Gabbana, que têm feito todos os criadores de conteúdo de moda comentarem e especularem, são, sim, do próprio guarda-roupa da atriz. Mas não se deixe enganar pelas aparências… À medida que a história de Mentiras, da Amazon Prime Video, se desenrola, a linha entre o que Belinda emprestou de seu próprio armário e o que ficou a cargo de Claudia Sandoval — a figurinista responsável por recriar a moda dos anos 80 usada por Daniela (sua personagem) e os demais — é bastante tênue. Ao mesmo tempo, foi ela quem deu aos personagens uma identidade própria expressa pelas roupas. E essa não foi uma tarefa simples. ""Há por trás uma pesquisa super intensa, aqui estamos explorando os personagens muito mais a fundo. Antes era uma peça de duas horas, agora são oito episódios"", comenta. Esse trabalho envolve questionar tudo sobre o personagem: quem ele é, quem são seus pais, por que se veste como se veste. Maeve Jinkings é capa Pride da Vogue Brasil ""Sempre tive o 'não' como ponto de partida"", diz Nany People Liliane Rocha: ""Amar é sempre um ato revolucionário"" O figurino de Belinda em Mentiras, a Série “Quando você entra no mundo da Daniela, tudo é rosa”, conta Sandoval. “As provas de figurino duravam horas e horas. Houve uma colaboração, porque ela, como todos os atores, tem um ponto de vista sobre seu personagem.” Assim se alinham as necessidades técnicas da produção — como o figurino aparecerá nos cenários — com a visão que os atores têm sobre seus próprios papéis. Com Belinda, em especial, um dos desafios foi conciliar sua agenda com os longos períodos de prova de figurino, já que, ao mesmo tempo, ela trabalhava no lançamento do álbum Indómita. “Daniela, se não me engano, tem cerca de 38 trocas de roupa na série.” Em um movimento inesperado — e pouco comum —, a atriz abriu seu guarda-roupa para Sandoval, pois sabia que algumas de suas peças combinariam perfeitamente com a personagem. “Belinda tem roupas que parecem de museu, é impressionante.” Entre elas, um casaco vermelho em forma de coração que Hedi Slimane criou para a coleção ready-to-wear de outono-inverno 2016 — justamente inspirada na moda dos anos 80. Também aparecem uma bolsa Louis Vuitton de edição limitada com penas rosa, um conjunto de camisa e calça da Versace usado como pijama, um vestido da Blumarine e, claro, sua icônica bolsa Hermès rosa-claro. “Há muitos momentos bem pequenos em que Daniela aparece e que mostram várias dessas trocas de roupa — como no flashback do avião e no da estreia no tapete vermelho. E esses momentos foram perfeitos para que Belinda nos emprestasse peças espetaculares do seu armário.” Depois, havia o ""look herói"", a roupa principal que Daniela usa durante toda a sequência na mansão Mijares. “O rosa, né? Aquele da Chanel”, me arrisco a dizer. “Não é Chanel, nós fizemos!” , responde Claudia. Em termos de produção, era preciso um traje que Belinda pudesse usar na cena mais longa da série — aquela que conduz a narrativa. Ele precisava ser imediatamente reconhecível. “O tailleur da Chanel que todos conhecem — se não for pela Jackie Kennedy, é pela Marge Simpson.” Um visual clássico e perfeito, que poderia facilmente ser confundido com outra peça preciosa do armário de Belinda. “Mandamos buscar o tweed em Nova York, recebemos vários tecidos e esse foi o escolhido depois de testarmos em câmera para ver como aparecia. Fizemos três versões idênticas para trocar durante as gravações.” Belinda veste um tailleur de tweed criado pela equipe de figurino de ""Mentiras"" — Foto: Divulgação/Maria Grinda / Amazon Prime México Quando falamos da estética da juventude de Daniela, surgem referências como os filmes Heathers e As Patricinhas de Beverly Hills, especialmente quando o visual pende mais para os anos 90. Algumas roupas eram originais dos anos 80, mas o desafio era levá-las ao universo todo rosa de Daniela. Por isso, o figurino foi recriado a partir de moldes originais da época, mas nos tons e formas que representassem a personagem. “Mas sempre havia o desafio de fazer tudo ter sentido. Daniela não tinha estilo só porque usava marca. Daniela tinha estilo porque ela tinha estilo, sabe?” Belinda, como Daniela, usando um conjunto esportivo rosa. — Foto: Maria Grinda / Amazon Prime México A figurinista de Mentiras, a série Claudia Sandoval é a figurinista de Mentiras, la serie, da Amazon Prime Video.

If anything these give off a trashy ghetto vibe. Rich people don't buy flashy designer brands, only broke people in credit card debt do. Just buy a nice variety of solid color Amazon Essentials and you'll have a nice wardrobe. If you really want designer, just get reps for super cheap.

Huế mở phiên sơ thẩm, xét xử ba bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương (SN 1992), Phạm Thanh Long (SN 1992) và Nguyễn Thu Trinh (SN 1992, cùng trú phường Xuân Phú, TP. Huế) về các tội “Lừa đảo chiếm đoạt tài sản” và “Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản”. Hội đồng xét xử tuyên phạt Lê Thị Hồng Phương 14 năm tù về tội “Lừa đảo chiếm đoạt tài sản”. Phạm Thanh Long bị tuyên phạt 5 năm tù, còn Nguyễn Thu Trinh lĩnh mức án 3 năm 6 tháng tù cùng về tội “Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản”. Hình ảnh các bị cáo tại tòa. Ảnh: Công lý Theo cáo trạng, đầu năm 2021, Lê Thị Hồng Phương kinh doanh online các mặt hàng như thực phẩm chức năng, mỹ phẩm, túi xách, nước hoa, đồng hồ... mang thương hiệu nổi tiếng như Hermes, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Versace. Để có vốn mở rộng hoạt động, Phương kêu gọi vợ chồng Long và Trinh góp vốn đầu tư. Nhóm này lập nhóm chat “Kim Monology Group” trên ứng dụng Viber để thực hiện giao dịch. Phương chủ động soạn các đơn hàng, ghi rõ thời gian hoàn vốn và mức lãi suất từ 10% đến 100% để thu hút góp vốn từ Long, Trinh và những người quen của họ. Mỗi đơn hàng có giá trị từ 10 triệu đồng đến hơn 4 tỷ đồng. Quá trình đầu tư ban đầu suôn sẻ, lợi nhuận cao khiến nhiều người tiếp tục rót vốn. Vợ chồng Long – Trinh cũng hưởng lợi từ việc hạ mức lãi suất cho nhà đầu tư cấp dưới, ăn chênh lệch từ phần lãi Phương đưa ra. Tuy nhiên, khi hoạt động kinh doanh bắt đầu thua lỗ, không tiêu thụ được hàng hóa, Phương mất khả năng thanh toán. Để tiếp tục duy trì dòng tiền, Phương lập các đơn hàng giả với mức lãi cao nhằm lôi kéo người mới góp vốn, thực chất là chiếm đoạt tài sản. Từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, Phương đã huy động vốn qua 1.158 đơn hàng, thu về tổng cộng 505,16 tỷ đồng, đã tất toán 990 đơn với lãi suất hơn 91,39 tỷ đồng. Còn lại 168 đơn chưa tất toán, tương đương 112,3 tỷ đồng. Sau khi trừ lãi đã trả, số tiền chiếm đoạt thực tế là 20,3 tỷ đồng, được Phương sử dụng vào các mục đích cá nhân như thuê nhà, kho bãi, vận chuyển hàng hóa, xoay vòng vốn và tiêu xài. Ngày 12/4/2022, Phương chính thức tuyên bố mất khả năng thanh toán. Cùng thời gian này, vợ chồng Long và Trinh sử dụng tiền cá nhân, tiền người thân và nhà đầu tư để góp vốn cho Phương. Đáng chú ý, ngay trong ngày 12/4/2022 – thời điểm Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ, Phương vẫn gửi 12 đơn hàng với lãi suất từ 6% đến 25% cho Long và Trinh nhằm tiếp tục huy động vốn. Ba nhà đầu tư gồm anh Nguyễn Tiến Phương góp 500 triệu đồng, chị Ngô Thị Diệu Lý góp 850 triệu đồng và anh Trần Hùng góp 794 triệu đồng. Vài giờ sau, Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ. Vợ chồng Long – Trinh chỉ hoàn trả cho anh Trần Hùng, không thông báo gì đến chị Lý và anh Phương, cũng không hoàn lại số tiền 1,35 tỷ đồng đã chiếm đoạt để sử dụng vào mục đích cá nhân. Hội đồng xét xử tuyên phạt Lê Thị Hồng Phương 14 năm tù, Phạm Thanh Long bị tuyên phạt 5 năm tù, còn Nguyễn Thu Trinh lĩnh mức án 3 năm 6 tháng tù. Ảnh: Công lý Sau khi Phương mất khả năng thanh toán, Long và Trinh bán căn nhà tại số 4/8 Phạm Ngọc Thạch (phường An Đông, TP. Huế) với giá 4,3 tỷ đồng để trả nợ cho người thân, song vẫn không hoàn trả khoản tiền 1,35 tỷ đồng cho chị Lý và anh Phương. Tại phiên tòa, các bị cáo thừa nhận toàn bộ hành vi phạm tội, thành khẩn khai báo, thể hiện sự ăn năn hối cải và xin được hưởng mức án nhẹ.

That same year, Alessia Russo's transfer from Manchester United to Arsenal made her one of the most expensive female footballers on the planet. Her contract is said to be worth more than £500,000 a year and her commercial appeal is just as lucrative. She has deals with Gucci, Adidas, PlayStation, Beats by Dr Dre and last month was gifted an MGS5 EV car, which she proudly showed off on Instagram. A regular at London Fashion Week, Alessia, 26, has appeared on the cover of magazines such as Women's Health. The BAFTA TV Awards in May saw her in a £1,295 Roland Mouret dress, right. BURBERRY CLAD GOALIE BURBERRY HANNAH Hampton - the longhaired goalkeeper with the girl-next-door looks - certainly has big shoes to fill after Mary Earps surprisingly announced her retirement from the squad last month. The 24-year-old Chelsea player has posed in Burberry for Elle magazine and counts Nike and Extra chewing gum among her corporate sponsors. She also works with Birmingham Children's Hospital after enduring numerous eye operations as a child to cure a squint. Hannah was told she would never be a professional sports player. ' I've gone through life proving people wrong,' she said recently, words that inspired devotion among her 228,000 Instagram followers. Her relationship status isn't known. DUBAI DEVOTEE SHE never travels without her Louis Vuitton luggage, can often be seen posing in a Maybach car, and enjoys swanky trips to Dubai, staying at the luxury Five resort there. Chelsea star Lauren James, 23, has treated herself to some of the finer things in life since her key role in the Lionesses' 2023 World Cup campaign. While her relationship status isn't known, she's close to her older brother Reece, who plays for the Chelsea men's team. She has commercial deals with Nike, Google Pixel, Optimum Nutrition, Sure deodorant and Walkers. The superstar siblings often attend red carpet events together. But while she is reportedly on £350,000 a year at Chelsea, Reece earns £250,000 a week. KOOKY STYLE SO DEVOTED is she to tattoos that midfielder Georgia Stanway, 26, not only has around 100 of her own inkings, but she's also learned to tattoo other people. The Bayern Munich star's kooky style has won her sponsors including Nike and an advertising deal with Celsius drinks, who featured on her Instagram page, where she has 433,000 followers. Off the pitch, she's been with Toulouse rugby league player Olly Ashall-Bott since 2022...."

mov_BC9A4FEEB4A452B2F015FEC91BF9BA46,2025-07-05 21:00:41,id,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[id]Liputan6.com, Jakarta - Ketika Oasis memulai tur reuni yang telah lama ditunggu-tunggu pada Jumat, 4 Juli 2025, dengan menggelar konser pembuka di Cardiff, Wales, merek-merek fesyen diperkirakan akan merapat memberi ""dukungan."" Hubungan yang secara historis retak antara Liam dan Noel Gallagher tidak hanya akan menghasilkan pertunjukan gemilang, namun emosional. Maka itu, menjangkau khalayak luas dan memanfaatkan gelombang nostalgia Britpop tahun 90-an untuk penjualan yang lebih tinggi seharusnya dilakukan para brand fesyen, menurut kolumnis Andrea Felsted, dikutip dari Bloomberg, Sabtu, 5 Juli 2025. Acara musik, terutama tur, selain perilisan album terkenal, seperti Cowboy Carter milik Beyonce dan Brat milik Charli XCX tahun lalu, telah jadi fenomena budaya. Levi Strauss & Co bekerja sama dengan Beyonce setelah lagunya ""Levii's Jeans,"" mengubah nama Instagram-nya sebentar menjadi ""Levii's"" dan meminta bintang tersebut untuk kampanye iklan. Banyak brand fesyen, termasuk Kate Spade milik Coach Inc., merangkul Brat. Sementara itu, desainer, termasuk Roberto Cavalli, Versace, dan Tiffany & Co. milik LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SE mendandani Taylor Swift. Kini, para pengecer berbondong-bondong mengikuti apa yang disebut sebagai ""Wonderwall Summer.""  Merek mewah asal Inggris Burberry Group Plc jadi yang terdepan. Meski tidak secara eksplisit terkait dengan tur tersebut, kampanye Burberry Festival menampilkan Liam Gallagher dan kedua putranya, Lennon dan Gene Gallagher, serta putrinya Molly Moorish-Gallagher. Dorongan pemasaran ini mengingatkan publik pada masa kejayaan Burberry di tahun 1990-an. Kampanye terbaru memang menampilkan musisi Goldie, serta para pesohor perempuan: Cara Delevingne dan Alexa Chung, tapi Liam adalah bintang utamanya. Ia mengenakan parka Burberry miliknya sendiri dari tahun 2018, yang akan diterbitkan ulang dalam edisi terbatas. Adidas AG lebih terbuka dalam menarik penggemar Oasis, dengan memproduksi koleksi dari co-branded clothing, yang dijual secara daring dan di toko-toko Adidas, serta Oasisinet.com, situs resminya, dan di stadion selama tur. Di antara nama-nama lain yang terlibat adalah Levi's, yang membuat serangkaian kaus oblong, dan Stone Island milik Moncler SpA, yang menampilkan Liam dalam kampanye musim gugurnya. Band rock pria, kata Felsted, berarti audiensnya beragam, yang berguna untuk penjualan pakaian pria dan wanita. Menurut GlobalData, pasar pakaian dan alas kaki pria sekitar dua pertiga dari ukuran pakaian wanita, menjadikannya peluang yang signifikan. Meski ketertarikan yang terus berlanjut terhadap segala hal yang berbau tahun 90-an telah memperkenalkan Oasis pada generasi baru, hampir setengah dari mereka yang hadir telah menyaksikan konser band tersebut sebelumnya, menurut laporan Belanja Konsumen Barclays Plc. Mengingat bahwa Gallagher bersaudara belum pernah tampil bersama sejak 2009, hal itu menyiratkan demografi yang lebih tua, yang sering kali berarti kelompok yang memiliki uang untuk dibelanjakan pada kegiatan rekreasi.  Ini juga membantu bahwa banyak gaya yang dikenakan band tersebut. Di antaranya adalah elana jins longgar, kaus sepak bola, dan sepatu kets low-rise yang kembali jadi tren berkat apa yang disebut estetika ""Blokecore."" Sementara Swifties mungkin telah memilih payet dan Beyhive dengan topi koboi, penggemar Oasis tampaknya berfoya-foya dengan parka dan topi bucket.  Meski panasnya musim panas, rata-rata unggahan  TikTok mingguan yang menampilkan parka naik 188 persen antara 1 Juni dan 1 Juli, dibandingkan dengan bulan sebelumnya, menurut perusahaan intelijen pasar Trendalytics. Pencarian parka di pasar barang bekas Depop naik 1.850 persen pada Juni 2025, dibandingkan dengan periode tahun sebelumnya. Topi bucket juga punya daya tarik tersendiri. Menurut penelitian Barclays, hampir sepertiga penggemar yang menghadiri konser berencana mengenakan busana bergaya tahun 90-an, dan untuk mendorong perusahaan yang bekerja sama, lebih dari seperlima berencana mengenakan co-branded item. Pembelian tersebut akan menyumbang 1,06 miliar pound sterling (sekitar Rp23,4 trilioun) yang diharapkan akan dibelanjakan penggemar Oasis Inggris secara keseluruhan, menurut Barclays. Angka ini mencakup tiket, akomodasi, serta biaya makanan dan minuman. Oasis sendiri tidak selalu memiliki hubungan yang mudah dengan dunia mode. Liam memulai Pretty Green pada 2009, tapi lini tersebut diakuisisi JD Sports Fashion Plc tahun 2019. Tiga tahun kemudian, JD menjualnya pada pesaingnya Frasers Group Plc. Namun, peritel yang dikendalikan Mike Ashley tersebut tidak lagi memiliki label tersebut."
mov_8C6C9837F1A6634A9F0735332D10AFE7,2025-07-05 22:01:57,en,WEB,"  After three years of dating, Scarlett Johansson and Colin Jost married in 2020 and welcomed their first child together in 2021. They've now been married for nearly four years and seem to still going strong. Both Johansson and Jost were big stars before they started dating and have only gotten more famous and successful since. Here's Jost and Johansson's complete relationship history so far, from their differing stories on how they met to where they're at today. 2006 The couple remember when they first met differently, and it seems like Jost may have been taken with the Ghost World actress long before she noticed him. He told Entertainment Tonight “The first time she hosted was the first year I was a writer on the show,” he claimed. “So, we've kind of known each other since then…she's the best.” In his memoir, A Very Punchable Face, Jost doubled down on his timeline, writing he immediately noted her as being “beautiful, smart, sweet, and intimidatingly sophisticated” and for having “a grace and a smile that I've still never seen in any other human.” “She has just turned 20, and I was 23, but in terms of status and maturing she was here [holds hand above head] and I was here [holds hand one inch off ground],” he continued. “She claims that she remembers thinking I was 'cute,' but I know what I looked like and that's not the word I would have used. ('Shaggy' would have been generous. ' Slovenly,' more accurate).” He added that he wrote a line for a My Sweet Sixteen sketch Johansson starred in that night. “The only line I remember from the sketch is when Scarlett's bratty character says, 'This party is literally worse than the Holocaust.' That was my Shakespearean sonnet for the woman I would one day fall in love with,” Jost joked. 2010 On her end, Johansson says she remembers Jost from 2010, when she hosted SNL yet again. The actress was placed in a parody of 16 and Pregnant. “It was some dumb parody that he had written, and he was in there partly directing this segment we had to do,” she told The Hollywood Reporter. At the time, Johansson was married to Ryan Reynolds. They divorced a month later in December 2010. March 2017 Johansson went on to marry French journalist Romain Dauriac, with whom she shares a daughter named Rose. In March 2017, the former couple had split, and Johansson had filed for divorce. She was slated to host SNL for a fifth time, and Jost was also single. Still, a source told E! at the time of her second divorce that Johansson was not ready to date. “Scarlett just got separated from Romain and is still dealing with the fact that now she's had two failed serious relationships,” the source said. “She's not trying to rush into anything and is just chilling.” May 2017 In May, Johansson played Ivanka Trump in SNL's season finale. Page Six reported that Johansson and Jost were seen together, and she was definitely noticing him. “Scarlett and Colin were making out at the bar at the SNL season finale party at 30 Rock,” said a source. “They would make out a bit, then go back to talking. They were at the bar in front of everyone...they made out at least twice...Then they went back to talking and hanging with other people.” A second source told E! News “Saturday night wasn't the first time,” the insider continued. “It's been going on for a bit.” They added that things were “fun and casual...They like each other, but it's not exclusive—at least not at this point.” June 2017 The following month, they were spotted at The East Pole on New York City's Upper East Side, seemingly having an intimate dinner. July 2017 They were seen again the next month, this time on a getaway for the Fourth of July weekend in Montauk, New York. A source speaking to Us Weekly Another insider told E!, “They are still getting to know each other, but she is really into him, and it's getting more on the exclusive level. Scarlett says he is different than many of the men she has been with. She is pretty picky who she goes out with even if it's just dating. They share many similarities together.” September 2017..."

朴千休接過最佳原創配樂獎座並發表得獎感言時，分享了他的創作理念。 他說：「我們嘗試融合南韓獨立流行音樂、美國爵士樂、現代古典音樂和傳統百老匯音樂，形成一個融合各種情感的大熔爐，我們非常感謝百老匯藝文人士對我們的包容，並接受我們的創新理念。」 朴千休這番話道出「也許是美好結局」之所以能夠跨越東西文化界線，且獲得觀眾與藝文權威人士廣泛認可的成功奧秘。 此外，「也許是美好結局」也驗證了，當藝術家願意擁抱多元，開放創新，就能創造出超越國界、打動人心的作品。 好萊塢演員麥克亞登（Michael Arden）榮獲最佳音樂劇導演獎時，感性表示：「艾倫森與朴千休共同創作了一部完美的音樂劇，它鼓勵我們儘管知道生命的時間有限，依舊可以放縱去愛。 這部音樂劇提醒了我們，同情心是孤獨的解藥，同理心並非弱點，而是人類共同的禮贈。」 亞登接著說，「現場音樂劇的觀賞體驗，驗證了無論我們彼此有多麼不同，都是相互聯繫的。 我們都在這裡，在這短暫而美麗的生命中邂逅。」 亞登這番扣人心弦的得獎感言，不僅精準詮釋了作品的核心精神，也讓現場的每位觀眾為之動容。 這部劇深刻地提醒著我們，在生命有限的旅程中，人際關係與愛是多麼珍貴。 「也許是美好結局」首演並進軍好萊塢以來，在紐約榮膺許多獎項，包括表彰傑出戲劇作品的「戲劇桌獎」（Drama Desk Awards）、外圈劇評人獎（Outer Critics Circle Awards，又稱外部劇評獎），以及戲劇聯盟獎（Drama League Awards）。 創意拍檔 跨國界整合資源
「也許是美好結局」的成就樹立了藝術界跨文化合作的典範，證明藝術的力量能夠超越語言、文化和國界的限制，刻畫彼此的共同情感，鼓勵觀眾反思生命、愛與彼此的連結和關係，觸動無數觀眾的心弦。 艾倫森與朴千休的創作關係始於2012年，當時他們共同創作了南韓音樂劇「Bungee Jump」（中譯「情約笨跳豬」、「愛的蹦極」），講述男女主角時隔多年後，因為躲雨而邂逅，進而墜入愛河的故事。 在南韓Wooran基金會（Wooran Foundation）的贊助下，艾倫森與朴千休二度合作「也許是美好結局」。 該基金會與南韓人氣票務平台「NHN Link Corporation」共同擔任百老匯表演的製作人，為這部跨文化合作的成功奠定強大基礎。 這種跨國界的資金與資源整合，為藝術家提供了實現偉大夢想及願景的機會。 艾倫森回顧兩人合作的起點，他在致詞時表示，「我認識朴千休的時候，他還在紐約大學（New York University）深造，但這位國際學生卻改變了我的人生。 如今，我們已經共同創作了四部音樂劇，我們在美國及其他國家工作，我們甚至站在頒獎舞台上，當著（加拿大籍頒獎嘉賓）基努李維（Keanu Reeves）的面發表得獎感言。」 艾倫森這一席話不僅展現他與朴千休的深厚友誼和絕佳默契，也突顯跨文化合作的無限可能。 藝術探索的多元面向
艾倫森與朴千休合作的作品除了「Bungee Jump」和「也許是美好結局」之外，也探討南韓歷史的主題，如2023年首演的音樂劇「男高音」（Il Tenore，義大利文）以1910年到1945年、日本帝國殖民時期的京城（即今日的首爾）為背景，講述「尹伊善」夢想成為朝鮮半島第一位男高音，以及獨立社運人士「徐珍妍」及「李秀漢」在軍國殖民氛圍下，協助尹伊善籌備歌劇演出的企畫與行動，講述年輕人在灰暗時代裡無懼外部打壓，勇敢追尋夢想的故事。 除了陰鬱的主題，艾倫森與朴千休也嘗試劇作的多元文化樣貌，譜寫2024年首演的浪漫喜劇「幽靈麵包店」（Ghost Bakery），其背景設定在1960年代的南韓，講述甜點師「順熙」遭解雇並租下破舊麵包店鋪後，與該店鋪已故老闆的幽靈從敵對到合作的故事。"

La «x» finale indica che viene organizzato localmente in modo indipendente, ma su licenza ufficiale concessa da Ted (acronimo di technology, entertainment, design, tecnologia, intrattenimento, design), organismo no profit con sede a New York, fondato nel 1984 da Richard Saul Wurman, architetto e designer, e Harry Marks, esperto di televisione e media. Nella nostra città esiste dal 2014 per iniziativa di Francesco Magagnino: «Alla prima conferenza vennero 150 persone nella sala più piccola della Gran Guardia», ricorda. Oggi in due giorni raduna più di 2.000 partecipanti, mobilita dai 60 agli 80 relatori, organizza oltre 20 laboratori, trova 72 sponsor, impegna 100 volontari. Il tutto all'insegna della gratuità: «Nessuno guadagna nulla». Il team di Tedx Verona, composto da circa 35 professionisti delle più svariate discipline che lavorano pro bono al progetto, è oggi uno dei primi fra i 220 esistenti in Italia. È divenuto talmente importante che il presidente Magagnino nei giorni scorsi è stato nominato dai dirigenti newyorchesi ambassador ufficiale della fondazione per l'Italia, al pari di Emilia Garito di Tedx Roma, ingegnera informatica. Però l'ambasciatore veronese, 43 anni, laureato in ingegneria e in economia all'Università di Trento, sposato con Claudia di Stefano, che lavora in Ibm, padre di Matilde (2 anni) e Olivia (nata a marzo), abituato da 15 anni a dividersi fra Milano e Verona, all'hobby culturale di Tedx ha affiancato un prestigioso incarico professionale: è responsabile per l'Italia, la Grecia e i Paesi dell'Est dell'area Ai (Artificial intelligence) di Accenture Song commerce, la divisione creativa e tecnologica focalizzata su marketing, design, esperienza cliente e trasformazione digitale. In pratica accompagna le aziende nell'uso dell'Intelligenza artificiale, o Ia che dir si voglia, per migliorare la relazione con i loro clienti. Lo fa in questa multinazionale nata dalla fusione delle parole accent e future, sede legale a Dublino, oltre 740.000 dipendenti nel mondo, fatturato annuo intorno ai 65 miliardi di dollari, presente in più di 120 Paesi. Accenture è uno dei colossi della consulenza insieme a Deloitte, Pwc, Kpmg, Ey e McKinsey. Magagnino deve la sua intelligenza naturale al padre Mario, docente nella facoltà di scienze della comunicazione dell'Università di Verona, e alla madre Marilina Sperandio, già insegnante di diritto ed economia all'istituto Pindemonte. Partiamo da Tedx. «C'entra la passione per il mondo digitale. Da bambino misi le mani sul primo computer, un 286 di fabbricazione russa, credo, di quelli con il monitor monocromatico e i caratteri a fosfori verdi su sfondo nero. Lo usavo nell'ufficio di papà per giocare a Tetris su un floppy disk gigante. Al primo anno di superiori mi fu regalato un pc tutto mio». C'è relazione con Tedx? «Sì, perché Tedx è un momento di incontro tra persone che sono appassionate di innovazione digitale. La mia tesi di laurea verteva sui sistemi adattivi, le tecnologie che hanno preceduto quelle di oggi. Partivamo dai modelli usati nella psicoanalisi per studiare la relazione uomo-uomo e li applicavamo alla relazione uomo-macchina». Roba da emicrania. «Due anni e mezzo fa è arrivata l'Intelligenza artificiale generativa, che ha cambiato le regole del gioco. Prima era una faccenda per super esperti, oggi aiuta le imprese a ottimizzare organizzazione e processi produttivi, a creare nuovi servizi. Tre lustri fa avevo vissuto la rivoluzione digitale nelle aziende. Ricorda quando Time nel 1982 mise in copertina il pc e lo proclamò ""Man of the year"", l'uomo dell'anno? Beh, qui siamo a una velocità mai vista prima. Da un cambiamento intergenerazionale siamo passati a uno stagionale». E Tedx lo racconta. «Presenta storie di lavoro, di sacrificio, di persone, di idee. Ha senso condividerle. Ho scoperto realtà aziendali veronesi straordinarie, come Clx, che ogni anno crea 250.000 immagini per Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Gucci, Fendi, Versace, Bulgari, Ferragamo e altre griffe, e per riviste come Vogue, che le usano per pubblicità, app, web e stampa. Ricordo ancora l'avvincente relazione di Massimo Delledonne, professore ordinario di genetica all'Università di Verona, che fu il primo a scrivere la sua tesi di laurea con il pc, mentre i suoi colleghi ancora usavano la Olivetti Lettera 22. Nel 2014 ci preconizzò: ""Un giorno in farmacia ci daranno medicine compatibili con il nostro patrimonio cromosomico"". Aveva sequenziato per anni il Dna di tutti gli esseri viventi, a cominciare dal suo». Perché Ted ha nominato ambassador proprio lei? «L'evento annuale di Verona, del quale sono licenziatario, è uno dei più qualificati in Italia. Nel 2023 vennero qui 300 organizzatori di Tedx nel mondo, persino dall'Argentina, dal Giappone, dai Paesi arabi». Ha ospitato relatori famosi. «Molti. Fra loro, Simon Lancaster, l'ex ghost-writer del premier britannico Tony Blair. La sua relazione sul linguaggio segreto che assicura la leadership a chi raggiunge i vertici della politica e degli affari, tenuta a Tedx Verona nel 2016, finora è stata vista su Youtube da 4,7 milioni di persone». Sfruttate i social. «Parecchio. Abbiamo un pubblico giovane. Impressiona il fatto che a ogni nuovo evento almeno 180 candidati, in prevalenza donne, aderiscano all'appello per venire come volontari ad aiutare in Tedx». Come si chiamano coloro che partecipano a questi incontri? «Qualcuno li definisce tedxers, in italiano tedxari». Ho notato che hanno tutti la barba, tranne lei...."

Sunday, Jul 06, 2025 L'actualité Le mystère entoure la mort du magnat du pétrole russe Andrei Bedalov. Andrei Bedalov, un cadre supérieur de Transneft, a été retrouvé mort après être tombé d'un immeuble de plusieurs étages à Moscou, s'ajoutant à une série de décès mystérieux parmi les élites russes. Andrei Bedalov, un vice-président senior de 62 ans de Transneft, le monopole des pipelines pétroliers d'État de la Russie, a été retrouvé mort après être tombé du 17ème étage d'une tour résidentielle de luxe à Rublyovka, un quartier prestigieux de Moscou. Les premiers rapports des médias russes suggèrent que la cause du décès pourrait être un suicide, avec des indications que Bedalov a laissé une note pour sa femme. Bedalov, qui avait été nommé à son poste chez Transneft il y a quatre ans, était crédité d'avoir aidé l'entreprise à surmonter les défis posés par les sanctions occidentales. Avant son mandat chez Transneft, il avait travaillé à l'Institut de recherche scientifique d'État Vyskhod et avait étudié à l'Académie de l'état-major des forces armées russes, qui forme des officiers et des administrateurs de haut rang. Sa mort soudaine fait partie d'une tendance préoccupante parmi les figures russes de haut niveau, dont beaucoup ont été des critiques du président Vladimir Poutine. En octobre 2022, un autre magnat du pétrole, Mikhail Rogachev, 64 ans, est mort dans des circonstances similaires, tombant d'une hauteur de 33 mètres. Rogachev avait été vice-président chez Yukos, une entreprise pétrolière qui a été démantelée après avoir opposé l'administration de Poutine. Les rapports indiquaient qu'il était décédé après avoir lutté contre le cancer, bien que sa famille ait contesté les affirmations concernant son état mental avant sa mort. D'autres décès mystérieux parmi des Russes éminents ont suscité l'interrogation à l'international. En septembre 2022, Ravil Maganov, un magnat de Lukoil, l'une des plus grandes entreprises pétrolières de Russie, est tombé d'une fenêtre de l'Hôpital clinique central du Kremlin. Vladimir Nekrasov, qui a succédé à Maganov, est mort en octobre 2023 d'une insuffisance cardiaque à l'âge de 66 ans. Un autre cas notable est celui de Vladimir Lebedev, un législateur associé à Lukoil, qui est décédé un mois plus tard à l'âge de 60 ans. Vitaly Robertus, un autre vice-président chez Lukoil, est également décédé en mars 2023 à l'âge de 53 ans. Ces incidents ont contribué à une spéculation croissante sur la sécurité et les circonstances entourant la vie de l'élite russe.

But if we're being honest, especially in the summer, my stomach has always been my biggest insecurity. I've always longed for a flat, toned tummy. Even when I was younger, I never felt like it looked the way I wanted it to. And now, as I get older, I know how much harder it is to keep it tight and toned. I tried everything. Almost gave up. But this little device gave me a reason to keep going. It's easy. It's effective. Spoiler alert: it's not just for your tummy! It's also my secret weapon for toned legs, booty, and arms too. Not perfect. Never trying to be. Just feeling better than I have in decades. With a new sense of confidence in summer clothes…… And that's what matters. P.S. That runner's tan is EARNING its moment.

Donatella Versace, designer, entrepreneur and symbol of the brand, bids farewell to her position by reuniting the key figures who defined the house's imaginary. Versace's Fall 2025 campaign is not just a collection; it is a statement of affection. The campaign features Claudia Schiffer, Kate Moss, Amber Valletta, Kristen McMenamy, Natasha Poly, Saskia de Brauw, Anok Yai, Liu Wen, Mica Argañaraz, Mila Van Eeten and Jacqui Hooper. All of them, wrapped in metal, archive and silhouettes portrayed by Mert & Marcus. 'Every collection is a story, and this is the story of Versace,' said Donatella. There is no nostalgia. There is narrative. What you see in this campaign is an intimate farewell that is not meant to be tragic, but celebratory. And among the eternal codes of the house's clothes, the liquid metal and the impossible waists, the new Virtus bag appears, called to be the symbol of this new stage. All this comes after months of speculation, confirmed this year with the purchase of Versace by the Prada Group for 1.25 billion euros. And with it, the appointment of Dario Vitale as the new creative director. The changeover is now official. Even so, Donatella, far from leaving, will continue as Versace's global ambassador."
mov_D0D918B939A2007CF69794B47E661DAE,2025-07-07 11:59:55,en,WEB,"  Versace Fall Winter 2025, Courtesy of Versace Donatella Versace's final campaign for the House that bears her name has arrived. With the Fall Winter 2025 visuals, the iconic designer delivers a parting message steeped in emotion, legacy, and unmistakable glamour. “Be yourself. Believe in yours. Break the rules,” she declares, an ethos that has defined her reign and now becomes its closing refrain. Photographed by Mert & Marcus , the campaign unites familiar faces and signature styles. Claudia Schiffer , Kate Moss , Kristen McMenamy , Amber Valletta , Natasha Poly , Saskia de Brauw , Liu Wen , Mica Argañaraz , Anok Yai, Mila Van Eeten and Jacqui Hooper return in looks that straddle both the past and present. Archival pieces, like the label's metallic mesh, appear alongside newer designs, including the Virtus bag adorned with the V-emblem. The collection reaffirms Donatella's long-standing fascination with contrasts: strength and sensuality, armor and elegance, control and chaos. Versace Fall Winter 2025, Courtesy of Versace The visuals are saturated in gold, casting a literal glow on the designer's final statement. According to Donatella, this campaign was about more than fashion: “The energy on this campaign was extraordinary. It was all about friendship, loyalty, and love.” Her parting words extend beyond the clothes, shaping the tone of a legacy rooted in bold femininity and fearless attitude. Over the years, Donatella championed unapologetic glamour while pushing boundaries for women in fashion. Each of her collections told a story, of power, seduction, rebellion, and this final campaign threads those stories together into one cohesive narrative. It becomes both a retrospective and a vision for the future, positioning the Versace woman not as a figure of the past, but as a timeless presence with unstoppable force. Versace Fall Winter 2025, Courtesy of Versace As Donatella steps down, Versace enters a new era under Dario Vitale , formerly of Miu Miu. While all eyes are now on what comes next, this final campaign stands as a culmination of one of fashion's most formidable creative tenures, an unapologetic farewell that reflects the House's past while daring it to evolve.

Find out the answer to this and other questions about recent antitrust activity in the #fashion and #luxury industries on this week's episode of the AmericanBarAssociation Antitrust Law Section's Our_Curious_Amalgam podcast, on which I had the privilege of being interviewed by Jeny Maier and Puja Patel. What happens when antitrust law meets high fashion? In episode 333, experienced fashion and luxury industry counsel Andowah Newton, joins Jeny Maier of Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider and Puja Patel of ClearyGottlieb to unpack recent antitrust cases in the luxury and fashion industries. From the #FTC's challenge to Tapestry's (Coach katespadeny StuartWeitzman) attempted $8.5B acquisition of Caprii_Holdings (MichaelKors JimmyChoo Versace), to… ""No-poach"" & “no-hire” claims against Saks, BrunelloCucinelli_brand, Gucci, LoroPiana, LouisVuitton, and Prada), to… ""Tying"" claims against Hermès and its coveted #Birkin bag, we explore how #competition law is colliding with market definition, exclusivity, #branding, and status. Listen in for insights on how antitrust enforcers—and the courts—are approaching consolidation, labor & employment practices, and sales tactics in industries where scarcity sells.

1lty23e,2025-07-07 16:03:21,en,REDDIT,"  Hey frag fam, 24M from Delhi here. I've been into fragrances for a while now, but most of what I know today is thanks to this amazing community. Whether it was going down rabbit holes on old threads or reading all the reviews and recommendations, I've learned so much — and I genuinely want to thank all the fellow fragheads here for helping me become a more cognoscenti person in this world of scent. I started out with just 2–3 designer bottles, and looking back now, I'm genuinely proud of how far I've come. From blindly wearing basic stuff to now appreciating note breakdowns, flankers, seasonal wear — it's been a fun and nerdy ride I used ChatGPT to help organize this post, but all opinions are mine. Here's my current designer starter pack – 15 fragrances, quick thoughts, and ratings: 1. YSL Y EDP – My all-time favourite. Clean, fresh, sweet, gets compliments without even trying. 10/10 2. 1 Million Lucky – Hazelnut and plum combo that's just addictive. Discontinued and that hurts. 9/10 3. Acqua Di Giò Profumo – Classy AF. Smells like a CEO went for a walk by the sea. 9/10 4. YSL MYSLF – At first I was like meh… but it grew on me. Fresh, musky, different. 8.5/10 5. Dior Homme Sport 2021 – Ginger kick with a clean drydown. Very easy to wear. 8.5/10 6. Armani Code Parfum – Softer, modern version of the OG. Perfect for close settings. 8.5/10 7. Acqua Di Giò Parfum (2024) – The newest one, and honestly pretty good. Fresh with depth. 8/10 8. 1 Million EDT – Loud, sweet, and still works when I want to stand out. Club or winter frag. 8/10 9. Terre d'Hermès EDT – Smells like grown-man confidence. Dirty orange + vetiver vibe. 8/10 10. Versace Dylan Blue – My safe pick when I don't know what to wear. Just works. 8/10 11. Afnan SNOI – Aventus vibes with darker, fruitier twist...."

mov_C233D747CE2FDA15A917280D67461624,2025-07-07 21:25:21,en,WEB,"  Despite having never designed any jewelry or visited the island of Capri until recently, the iconoclastic artist Marina Abramović has gamefully joined forces with Chantecler Capri. In what seems to have been one of the more al fresco approaches to sharing the news of a collaboration, the island, which is located in the Gulf of Naples just a few nautical miles from the Peninsula of Sorrento, welcomed the artist late last month for a public event entitled “Breathing Rocks.” The Chantecler x Marina Abramović capsule collection is inspired by Abramović's art and the island's primordial forces. The preview initiative — held at the Tragara vista where the towering Faraglioni rocks rise from the sea in the distance — didn't just have the municipal administration's support, Capri's Mayor Paolo Falco was on hand, as were its councilors Salvatore Ciuccio and Melania Esposito. They weren't just there to show some face time, but to relay, on behalf of the community, the value of the cultural dialogue that Abramović's presence brought. The Serbian-born conceptual artist's body of work includes videos, soundscapes, installations, photographs and solo performances including the seminal “The Artist Is Present.” During a three-month run at the Museum of Modern Art in New York in 2010, Abramović sat unblinkingly every day, as thousands of strangers lined up to have the chance to stare back at her. Chantecler's creative director, Maria Elena Aprea, was responsible for corralling Abramović, with help from art director and stylist Andrea Lazzari and the Modern Art Museum of Shanghai's artistic director Shai Baitel. For “Breathing Rocks,” the artist sat down with Baitel and journalist and author Cesare Cunaccia, whose books include “Capri Dolce Vita.” A Q&A session with attendees took place at the end of the program. During the conversation, the artist spoke of how she has explored areas that relate to art and design, but this was her first foray into jewelry design in her decades-long career, Baitel said Monday. The Chantecler endeavor was “a natural continuation” of Abramović's ['Transforming Energy'] exhibition at the Modern Art Museum in Shanghai, which dealt with stones, minerals and energy and which wound down in March, he said. In turn, the artist designed with Lazzari the concept of the three stones, which references the island's natural phenomenon of the Faraglioni. Each stone is meant to have its own energy, which is in line with the artist's design philosophy. Intent on extending the philosophy about energy that she had used with Baitel in the MAM Shanghai show, Abramović kept going back to their discussions about curating energy. “I said, 'We don't curate the physical. We curate the metaphysical.' She said, 'OK, so there's a great jeweler of the necklaces, but the importance is the energy that the stones give you. Now you have this halo that is kind of a secret. It is part of the goodness that the stones bestow on you.' It's curious because this is not an art exhibition, but it's a relative philosophy to what's behind the art,” Baitel said. More in Entertainment Accustomed to speaking with Abramović several times a week and sometimes several times a day, Baitel said, “She loves fashion. It's only been in the past year or two that she's speaking more about how fashion is part of what she does.” (As part of the endeavor, Abramović received a dress designed by Italian label Crida, which was created by its founders Cristina Parodi and Daniela Palazzi.) In the past, the artist has turned up at fashion shows for Prada, Versace, Jil Sander, MM6, Ferragamo and other brands. She once collaborated with Riccardo Tisci too on the art project that was entitled “Contact.” Last year Abramović debuted skin care and wellness products as part of the Abramović Longevity Method and she joined forces with the Italian brand Massimo Dutti for Miami Art Week 2024. More recently, she rolled out a NFT project with TAEX “Marina Abramović Element.” Founded in 1947 by Pietro “Chantecler” Capuano, an heir to a family of the Neapolitan jewelers, with his friend Salvatore Aprea, the brand started with one store on Capri. Jet setters like Audrey Hepburn and Ingrid Bergman Rossellini were among the early fans. Aprea's heirs Gabriele, along with his wife Teresa and sisters Maria Elena and Costanza, now run the business, which has headquarters in Milan and a production center in Valenza Po, an area known for its goldsmiths. Presented with collaborative opportunities all the time, Abramović liked that Chantecler has such an elegant boutique on Capri, as well as for its reutation for being a brand for “people in-the-know like Jackie Kennedy, as opposed to being proliferated for the mass market,” Baitel said. “She liked that it was unique like an original piece of art,” he said. Due out in September, the assortment includes a necklace, bracelet and earrings. Next year Abramović's exhibition will debut at the Gallerie dell'Accademia, during the Biennale in Venice. “She will be turning 80 next year. And this is like the Oscars of the art world,” Baitel added."

mov_DDF6C3A5A1E054BF57D8010BE6885036,2025-07-08 05:00:49,en,WEB,"  Fiorucci Spring Summer 2026 backstage moments captured by Sohom Das for DSCENE   With a career spanning some of the most iconic names in Italian fashion, Versace, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Givenchy, and Ferragamo, Francesca Murri has quietly shaped the visual language of contemporary luxury. In 2023, she took the creative helm at Fiorucci, the legendary Italian label founded in 1967 by Elio Fiorucci. Tasked with revitalizing a brand known for its irreverence and pop spirit, Murri has already presented four collections that pulse with energy, color, and optimism. Murri's approach to Fiorucci is equal parts reverence and reinvention. Drawing deeply from the house's rich archive, she reinterprets its iconic motifs—lips, angels, hearts, through a modern, playful lens. Her debut collection, unveiled at Milan Fashion Week in September 2023, set the tone for her tenure: a vibrant celebration of joy, freedom, and creativity, all rooted in Fiorucci's signature DNA. The upcoming “ Beatittudo ” FW25 collection continued this narrative, inspired by the pursuit of pure happiness and characterized by a bold palette that injects fresh energy into the brand. Under Francesca Murri, Fiorucci has become a platform for experimentation and dialogue, embracing collaborations with artists and emerging talents from across the creative spectrum. Her vision is about more than clothes; it's about fostering a community and spreading positive messages that resonate in today's world. By blending the brand's storied past with the needs and languages of modern society, Murri is ensuring Fiorucci's legacy remains as dynamic and relevant as ever. Below, Francesca Murri discusses with DSCENE's EIC Zarko Davinic her creative process, the role of Milan, the power of contrasts, and her hopes for Fiorucci's future post her Spring Summer 2026 runway show in Milan . Photo ©Sohom Das   What does it mean for you and Fiorucci to present your collections in Milano every season? How does the city's unique energy influence your creative process? – Milano is where Elio Fiorucci created everything and started dreaming. It's crucial for me to catch the spirit of the city and put it into a very international narrative. Influences come from everywhere in this place full of art. Piazza Fiorucci is described as a space where everyday reality and fantasy meet. How did you translate this concept into both the collection and the show's outdoor set design? – For the collection I asked Janina Zais to work body painting and hair spraying the models to inject the cartoonish approach into the products. I also take inspiration, for the red pois dress, from the Walt Disney character Minnie. For the set design I wanted to use banners that represented the sky and road signs on the ground with totally invented and fantastic elements such as the angel shooting the arrow. The collection is full of contrasts, urban yet dreamlike, tender yet sensual. How do you approach balancing these opposing elements in your designs? – I play very much with contrasts that are very crucial for the brand. When there's something basic I apply something unexpected in a very Fiorucci way. And also the contrast played through the association between products and faces is very important. Rock characters with chic products and the opposites work very well. Many pieces play with iconic Fiorucci motifs, like the lips, angels, and hearts, reimagined in playful, pop-art ways. What draws you to these symbols, and how do you keep them feeling fresh? – I always start by defining the key pillars of the brand and based on the seasonal concept I focus on the ones that help me to push forward the concept. This season the pop, cartoonish approach influenced my way to characterize them. The slogan “Make Hearts Beat Again” featured on accessories and tees is both affectionate and provocative. What message are you hoping to send with this phrase? – In these uncertain moments in which everyone is a bit scared, I wanted send out a positive message by inviting people to make hearts beat again. An ode to love! Photo ©Sohom Das   The collection uses a bold color palette and a mix of classic and innovative materials, from recycled PVC to Tyvek and glossy coatings. How do you decide which materials best express a new Fiorucci era? – We usually search for innovative materials and this is very important to express the feelings I am having at the beginning of the creative process. The unexpected approach to the usage of the materials can create uniqueness. In a time when the fashion industry faces economic challenges and a looming recession, what do you believe will help brands like Fiorucci stay resilient and relevant? – It's hard for the new projects to find a place in this tough and crowded market. I believe that Fiorucci can have a role in society by creating a platform for collaborations with emerging talents to generate very creative contents not only in fashion but also in art and music. Looking ahead, how do you see Fiorucci's identity evolving? What are your hopes for the brand, and for the industry? – I see the project more mature season after season. I hope the market will get better soon to have more opportunities to reach our targeted clients throughout pop ups and stores and give them more chances to experience the brand.

From mukaish coats to the controversial Kohlapuri sandals, here's a round-up Paris and Milan Fashion Week Spring Summer 2026 made one thing very clear. Fashion's gaze is locked on India. Not the soft-focus version from a postcard or the usual token bindi or scarf. This time, it was more immersive. Textiles, embroidery, silhouettes, footwear, set design. India was threaded into the very core of the season. Okay, so this is not new Fashion has always turned to India for ideas. It is a long history dressed up as inspiration. For instance, Jean Paul Gaultier showed turbans, bindis, and sherwani jackets in his 2007 couture line. John Galliano pulled heavily from Mughal silhouettes during his Dior years. Karl Lagerfeld sent Chanel's Métiers d'Art to Mumbai back in 2012. The staging was theatrical. The embroidery was Indian. The credits were barely there. Dries Van Noten once said India was his textile dreamland. He was not alone. Fast fashion jumped in too. High street brands have churned out block prints, mirror work, paisley shawls, and even yoga pants with temple motifs. Little to no credit was given. Dior's shiny coat came at a cost One of the most talked-about pieces from Paris Fashion Week SS 26 came from Dior. A long silver coat, completely hand-embroidered using the Mukaish technique, shimmered its way into every major fashion feed. It was stunning. It also came with a story no one told. Mukaish is a painstaking craft that dates back to third-century Lucknow. It involves tiny flattened metal wires stitched into fabric, creating a constellation of dots that catch the light. Royalty once wore it. Today, barely a handful of skilled artisans still know how to make it right. That one Dior coat took twelve artisans over thirty days to finish. The coat's reported value was close to two hundred thousand dollars. But despite the effort and the heritage, the brand did not credit the embroidery technique or the artisans in the show notes. That silence drew instant heat from Indian designers, craft activists, and media. Prada's sandals were just not sandals Prada's menswear show in Milan SS26 made waves for all the wrong reasons. Among the slick tailoring and rich fabrics was a humble-looking sandal. Open-toe, flat sole, a leather toe-loop. Yes, we are talking about Kolhapuris. These are not just any shoes. They are traditional hand-made sandals crafted in Maharashtra for generations. They have been granted geographical indication status, which means their design is protected, legally linked to their region and community. Prada described them as “leather flat sandals.” That was it. No reference to Kolhapur. No mention of India. Nothing. The backlash was swift. The Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce raised formal concerns...."

mov_4F6C592BFF74DF8E1465287FFC8DB698,2025-07-08 07:08:17,en,WEB,"  India, July 8 -- The runways at the Milan and Paris Fashion Weeks made one thing very clear: fashion's gaze is turned to India. Even as questions around appropriation arose, India was threaded firmly into the core of the season, from textiles and textures, right down to the models and set design. Fashion has always turned to India for ideas. It is a long history dressed up as inspiration. For instance, Jean Paul Gaultier showed turbans, bindis, and sherwani jackets in his 2007 couture line. John Galliano pulled heavily from Mughal silhouettes during his Dior years. Karl Lagerfeld sent Chanel's Metiers d'Art to Mumbai back in 2012. The staging was theatrical. The embroidery was Indian. The credits were barely there. Dries Van Noten once said India was his textile dreamland. He was not alone. Fast fashion jumped in too. High street brands have churned out block prints, mirror work, paisley shawls, and even yoga pants with temple motifs. Little to no credit was given. Dior served up Paris Fashion Week's most talked-about pieces: a shimmering, mukaish-embroidered long coat. This art form dates back to third-century Lucknow and involves flattened metal wires stitched into fabric. Once worn by royalty, the Dior version (valued at close to 1.72 lakh) took twelve artisans and over thirty days to finish. However, the brand did not credit the technique or the artisans involved in its show notes, drawing flak from Indian designers and craft activists. Prada's menswear show in Milan SS26 made waves for all the wrong reasons. Among the slick tailoring and rich fabrics was a humble-looking sandal. Open-toe, flat sole, a leather toe-loop. Yes, we are talking about Kolhapuris. These are not just any shoes. They are traditional hand-made sandals crafted in Maharashtra for generations. They have been granted geographical indication status, which means their design is protected, legally linked to their region and community. Prada described them as ""leather flat sandals."" That was it. No reference to Kolhapur. No mention of India. Nothing. The backlash was swift. The Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce raised formal concerns. Indian designers called it out. Eventually, Prada issued a letter acknowledging the sandals were inspired by India and said they were open to future dialogue with Indian artisans. While global brands were fumbling with credits, Kartik Research arrived in Paris and flipped the script. The Delhi-based label presented a travelogue-like collection, accompanied by a visual essay titled, How to Make It in India. The brand also finally forayed into womenswear amid serious buzz. From textiles to silhouettes, each piece told a story of Indian craftsmanship, ranging from handlooms to hand-weaving and dyeing. Surfaces also told a story of heritage, with Jaipur rugs covering every inch of the set. Pharrell Williams's second menswear show for Louis Vuitton was another moment where Indian craft played a leading role. The runway was staged on Paris's oldest bridge, which was transformed into a snakes and ladders board. The set was designed by Indian architect Bijoy Jain and built using Indian marble, stone, and wood. The soundtrack was created in collaboration with A R Rahman. Palm trees, crystal-studded trunks, elephant motifs, and even a miniature autorickshaw bag nodded to Indian and South Asian culture. This was not an abstract reference. Louis Vuitton clearly credited the designers, artists, and inspiration behind the show. India's fashion week footprint did not end at fabric or set designs - models from India took centre stage at some of the biggest showcases. Walking for Hermes was Nakul Bhardwaj, who made headlines last year as the first Indian on the Versace runway. Meanwhile, Jainil Mehta made waves at Louis Vuitton, Saurang Sharma (pictured left) brought his quiet power to Issey Miyake and Shubham Vaidkar appeared in Giorgio Armani's presentation...."

n1yhd8i,2025-07-08 09:34:50,en,REDDIT,"  Yea, usually the perfumes they're duping I can easily find the OG on outlet retailers for just as cheap or maybe $20 more...and those retailers have A+ ratings with the Better Business Bureau (I checked them all) that have been in business 20 years online - so they're NOT selling fakes. They're just not. Business go out of business all the time and have to auction off their authentic perfumes to outlet retailers, older perfumes stop selling, and they have to clear inventory for new perfumes, as well. I bought Versace Crystal Noir was $40 on ForeverLux since thats a 20 year old perfume - it hit outlet retailers like 17 years ago and they've done nothing but accumulate those perfumes. Then there are testers that are even cheaper. In fact, I've seen a Maison Alhambra VS Bombshell dupe selling for MORE on Amazon than the actual VS Bombshell on Fragrancenet/ForeverLux/Fragrancebuy(!) - which is usually in the links to your favorite perfume influencers on youtube where they earn a commission. So if it's good enough for them, the Better Business Bureau to give them an A+, and having never bought a fake from any of those 3 websites, it's good enough for me. There's no need to resort to these very, VERY cheaply made (and unhealthy) perfumes. I don't wanna breathe in that shit so strong all day that I can actually smell it! Ew! I'm done with cheap Lattafas and their umbrella brands after Minya dried down to smelling like Tupperware. Smelled so good at first and all the ingredients were covering the phthalates then in the 4th hour nothing but plastic left. Giving away my bottle with a health warning."

The video, filmed across Dubai and Los Angeles at SoundStruck Studios and FIVE Hotel Music Studio, incorporates cutting-edge AI technology and futuristic visuals, elevating her artistry to new heights. “Nicole's ability to convey raw emotion while commanding the stage is extraordinary,” says Sahaj Ticotin. “These videos carve out her mark as a visionary artist.” “Toxic,” a powerful dance pop anthem released via LA Music Records, delivers a raw, emotional narrative about overcoming toxic relationships, with captivating choreography and intense vocals that resonate deeply with audiences of all ages. “Nicole is a rare talent who brings passion and precision to every performance,” says Alina Liwo, founder of ALITI Productions & Talent Agency, who has been instrumental in guiding Nicole's stage presence, singing, modeling, and acting. “Her dedication to her craft at such a young age is truly inspiring, and these new releases are a testament to her boundless potential. Despite her demanding schedule as a full-time student, Nicole commits over 15 hours weekly to honing her skills under the mentorship of Dubai's finest industry coaches. She trains in classical music and violin with Mariana Lutsiv and collaborates with internationally acclaimed music producer Robert M. to craft her signature sound. Nicole's dedication and drive are evident in every frame as well as her performances at the WATERBOMB 2024 Dubai Festival, where she debuted four original songs before 30,000 fans, and at elite venues like the Palazzo Versace Dubai, and Burj Khalifa's Armani Hotel, which have solidified her reputation. Nicole's star power extends beyond music, with appearances in renowned publications such as GLAMOUR, Wizaz, Polki.pl, and GOLDEN WINGS Luxury Magazine. Her poise, talent, and relentless work ethic have made her a sought-after figure in both the entertainment and fashion industries. Nicole's rise is backed by LA Music Records, and a team of industry veterans, including producer Robert M. and Grammy-winner RedOne. With her debut album slated for release in Q4 2025, featuring collaborations with both American and Emirati artists, these music videos signal Nicole's unstoppable ascent within the industry. Fans and media are invited to follow Nicole's journey as she continues to redefine what it means to be a young performer in today's global spotlight.

mov_03164709509221F1E75C6B2C75F2525D,2025-07-08 14:48:04,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]È l'8 luglio e in molti vedono avvicinarsi le ferie. Diciamoci la verità, ci va poco di parlare della Paris Fashion Week (autunno/inverno, questo sconosciuto) e dei front row ai quali comunque non partecipiamo. La domanda fondamentale non è, stavolta, quella sulla vita l'universo e tutto quanto ma è solo ""cosa mettiamo in valigia?"". Per gli ultimi giorni prima delle vacanze c'è voglia di leggerezza, e chi dice leggerezza dice ""guarderemo i look delle vip in location esotiche e capiremo se c'è qualche spunto da copiare"". Che è proprio quello che faremo in questa ultima newsletter prima dell'estate vera e propria (sì, va in ferie anche la sottoscritta). Il bikini a fantasia (come Dua Lipa) Si aggira per i vicoli di Napoli con il futuro marito, si tuffa nelle acque cristalline delle Baleari insieme alle sue amiche e lo fa rigorosamente in costume a triangolo a fantasia. Il suo preferito - almeno a giudicare da Instagram - è animalier, ma sfoggia volentieri anche un modello a pois (una delle fantasie dell'estate) con inserti di pizzo. Quello per la vacanza spagnola è invece tempestato di cristalli. Il che la dice lunga sui modelli dell'estate: divertenti e dalle linee semplici. Il costume intero? Non pervenuto. Olivia Rodrigo e l'abitino gingham Non è che staremo sempre in spiaggia: certo, a questo punto potremmo non farcela per Wimbledon, ma un abitino bon ton in valigia può sempre servirci per un aperitivo o simili. Sceglietelo come il suo: a quadretti (in gergo gingham), altra fantasia estiva che a sorpresa ha invaso le boutique e tutti i guardaroba delle star, vedere anche alla voce Bella Hadid e Daisy Edgar Jones (il suo, bianco e nero, è già sold out), che lo scelgono in versione prendisole. Il plus? Vi potete sbizzarrire sul colore.  Alexa Chung e la bandana Un occhio (anche alla comodità): avete presente quando, in spiaggia o durante un giro in barca, i capelli svolazzano e sembrate appena uscite dalla seduta di un parrucchiere pazzo? Fortunatamente è tornata di gran moda la bandana, che risolverà tutti i vostri problemi di bad hair day oltre a donarvi quel tocco glam necessario per le foto su Instagram. Come indossarla? Non come Axl Rose ma come vostra nonna. Letteralmente. Fidatevi.  Il parka come gli Oasis La maggior parte del genere umano non è riuscita ad accaparrarsi un biglietto per la reunion dell'estate. Ma qualcuno andrà in montagna: ed è lì che il mood ""fratelli Gallagher"" potrà davvero sbizzarrirsi: secondo i dati raccolti Shopify il mese di giugno ha registrato un boom di ricerche per tutti i capi di abbigliamento che hanno reso iconici il duo inglese. Leggi parka, le felpe sportive (come le loro ironiche @adidas), bucket hat e giacche trucker.  PILLOLE FASHION L'ultima campagna di Donatella. A marzo è arrivato il temuto annuncio: Donatella ha lasciato la guida creativa di Versace. Il colpo di teatro però era in agguato: per la campagna che segna il suo ultimo atto Donatella ha rispolverato i nomi che hanno reso grande la maison. Kate Moss, Claudia Schiffer, Amber Valletta fotografate da Mert & Marcus per una collezione autunno-inverno dal fascino anni Novanta, che tanto ci piace.  La nuova era di Celine. Per ogni ultimo atto ce ne è un primo: è appena partita ufficialmente l'era di Michael Rider che subentra a Hedi Slimane come direttore creativo di Celine. La collezione, che è stata giudicata positivamente da un po' tutti, non rivoluziona ma rielabora i codici della Maison, come si dice in gergo, mescolandoli con un po' di ironia.  © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA"

She continued, ""I've never done anything where I look very different from myself before. And I'd really like to continue in this vein, because I felt there was something very freeing and liberating in it. There was a bravery that came from that. A courage that came from… disappearing.""

mov_93A1007C7545BA5074AB7E84F32FB24B,2025-07-08 17:17:23,en,WEB,"  In today's Daily Rundown video, Chris Versace reviews the Portfolio's decision to lock in some gains on American Express  ()  shares on Monday morning, as well as why President Trump's August 1 tariff deadline has injected a fresh wave of uncertainty into the market. Chris also explains why the Portfolio will remain prudent but opportunistic as we head into the June quarter earnings season. And he discusses expectations for Amazon's  ()  2025 Prime Day event, shares which companies we'll be listening to for confirmation, and why quarterly results from ConAgra  ()  could trigger some Bullpen work on our part. Transcript CHRIS VERSACE: Hey, everyone, Chris Versace. It is Monday, July 7. I hope you all had a fun, happy and safe Independence Day holiday. I know I certainly did, but here we are, kicking off the first full week of the September quarter. And as you probably saw, stocks are indeed trading off in response to renewed tariff and trade deal uncertainty. And you hopefully saw that we, in response to that, as well as the shares being overbought, took some profits in American Express shares early this morning. That decision to trim back and lock in some gains on Amex were a combination of the significant move in the shares since their April lows, but also the deep overbought. And by that, we mean relative strength index reading level that the shares had coming into this week. Stepping back a little bit when it comes to tariffs and trade deals, we're going to continue to see how the landscape develops. But our thinking is that if President Trump is coming out swinging, throwing out there this August 1 date when we could see tariff levels go back to their April 2 level, odds are there's some room for the market to be disappointed with what we're likely to hear in terms of announced trade deals in the next few days. Remember, today is the 7. The imposed trade deal deadline is July 9. We are hearing from certain White House officials that there will be deals announced in the next couple of days, but with the market overbought-- and by that, I mean the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ composite-- I'm kind of reading between the tea leaves. Trump throwing out this August 1 deadline seems to me to suggest that there could be some underwhelming interpretation of the deals that are announced. We've talked about this before, but it doesn't seem likely that we're going to get trade deals announced with Canada, with the Eurozone or China this week or anytime soon. So I suspect that's another reason why Trump is throwing out that August 1 date, as I talked about in our opening comments this morning, to try and reclaim the trade deal narrative. Now, again, we're going to continue to follow these developments. But make no mistake, we will remain prudent investors when and where it makes sense. Hence, our move this morning with American Express. But we will also look to remain opportunistic. So if you just think about some of the things that we did in the last few weeks, taking the pronounced strength in the shares of Microsoft, Marvell, NVIDIA, and even today with American Express, we've used them either to build up our cash positions, given what we see ahead or to make an opportunistic move, in some cases, the shares of Alphabet, SuRo Capital. And last week, we started a new position in the shares of TJX. Now, as we get ready for the June quarter earnings season, which is right around the corner, kicking up a gear arguably next week when we start to get big bank earnings, including those from Bank of America and Morgan Stanley, we're going to remain prudent and opportunistic investors. Now, some of the positions that we're interested in building up, TJX, obviously, it's our newest one, but also SuRo capital, ahead of what we expect to see the resumption of dividend payments given its BDC or business development company structure. But before we get to those big bank earnings, we do have a few things we want to talk about, especially Amazon's Prime Day event this week, as well as a number of competing ones. The usual cast of characters Walmart, Target, and a few others. Now remember, Amazon's Prime Day this year has been extended to four days from two, and it's going to run from Tuesday, July 7 through Friday, July 11. Now for context, Adobe Analytics sees the event hitting $23.8 billion across those four days. That's about a 28% or so increase year-over-year. Now, as we think about those numbers, do we have cost conscious consumers out there? We certainly do. Is there renewed tariff uncertainty, which could pull forward spending? Absolutely. And let's remember, too, that we also have before too long, even though the July 4th holiday has just passed, the back-to-school shopping season. So there are reasons to think that we could see some pull forward in spending happen. And based on what we see in terms of comments from other companies as they start reporting, whether it's Visa, Mastercard, or even our own American Express, we're likely to have some confirmation on the degree to which shoppers opened up their wallets during Prime Day and its competing events. Now, even though we sold some of American Express, it's that pull forward and spending, that strength in spending that we do want to capture with American Express shares, as well as the benefits of the upgrades that are coming to the platinum card membership. Remember, this is going to be the biggest that American Express has ever done. And typically, when we see that, we tend to see a nice kickup in terms of membership numbers. And we suspect that that will repeat. We also suspect that Amazon will be packing on the benefits to the platinum card in order to draw those members. It's that membership business model as to why we continue to favor American Express shares over the more transactional-led business models for Visa and Mastercard. Now, in addition to Prime Day and the competing events, which could be a catalyst for Amazon shares, we also have quarterly results starting this week with Conagra, Delta Airlines, and Levi Strauss. They're going to give us another dimension on consumer spending, especially I think what we hear from Conagra. Remember, they're predominantly packaged foods and frozen foods. To the extent that they see a pickup in volume, it would confirm some other signals that we're getting about consumers starting to eat increasingly at home, dialing back their restaurant spending...."

Sánchez, who wed Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos last month in a lavish, multi-day Venetian extravaganza, wore a latex dress by Versace, as she stepped out in the City of Lights. The formfitting bright red garment featured a corset bodice - that showcased her ample cleavage - as well as ruching at the skirt. It is currently retailing for $3,515 on luxury resale site Vestiaire Collective. The dress hit Lauren, 55, right above the knee and she paired the look with strappy black heels. It has also been worn by a few other celebrities this year, like model Amelia Gray Hamlin. The new Mrs. Bezos finished off the look with her hair sleek and straight, and carried a black crocodile Hermès Kelly bag, which typically has a resale value of over $50,000. Brooks Nader, 28, looked equally as glamorous for their Parisian night out, as she wore a pair of black capri pants and a totally sheer black halter blouse that left very little to the imagination. This week is the Paris Haute Couture Week, which runs from July 7 to the 10. Lauren's husband, Jeff Bezos, is expected to attend Allen & Co.'s annual leadership retreat in Sun Valley this week. It appears to be the first sighting of Sánchez after her whirlwind nuptials, of which Brooks also attended. The luxe event, which not only featured their actual wedding but multiple themed parties and brunches, saw them surrounded by 200 friends and family. A-listers like Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, and Kris Jenner all made an appearance, as well as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Ellie Goulding performed at their reception, while Usher also sang at their pajama-themed brunch the next day. The happy couple got married in a restored amphitheater on the island, as Sánchez wore a high-neck, long sleeve lace Dolce & Gabbana gown that took over 900 hours of atelier to make, per Vogue. The gown featured a flared skirt, long veil, and a tight-fitting waist, with tons of buttons going up the middle. 'Very Lauren. Sexy, happy, not too serious, not too drama. Elegant but at the same time sensual,' Domenico Dolce told the outlet about the bride's dress. But the dress wasn't the only star of the show. The Blue Origin astronaut had many looks for the different occasions, including a pajama-themed party on their last night. Sánchez chose a strapless, dusty pink bustier Atelier Versace gown for the event, with bejeweled detailing all over the body - but it was her secret accessory that really stood out. Throughout the weekend, Lauren also wore many custom accessories that were a nod to her new last name, like a black rhinestone-encrusted black clutch bag that read, 'Mrs. Bezos' on it in silver gems. On the morning of her wedding, Sánchez stepped out in a cream, two-piece skirt suit by Dior, adding a personal touch as she wore a brown braided bracelet with diamond charms that read 'LB,' in honor of becoming Lauren Bezos. But for Sánchez, it's not about the dress or the accessories - at the end of the day, she's just happy to be married to Bezos, who she describes as the love of her life. 'I'm very happy,' she told the outlet. 'More than the dress, I'm happy that I'm getting married and I get to spend my life with my best friend, someone who sees me, someone who adores me, someone who I adore. I am the luckiest woman on the planet,' she shared."

Ilhan Omar's daughter, Isra Hirsi, is unemployed and hawking her used clothes online just months after graduating from the elite Barnard College, she announced in a Tuesday Instagram story. ""Unemployment got me,"" Hirsi said, including a link to her page on Depop, a peer-to-peer marketplace. On the platform, Hirsi looked to unload some old clothing items, including a pair of Dr. Martens boots for $50 and her ""beloved multicolored striped cardigan"" for $15. Hirsi, like her mother, was an outspoken supporter of the pro-Hamas movement on campus during her time at Barnard. She is perhaps best known for being arrested at the Columbia University encampment in April 2024, which led to her suspension from Barnard. Barnard president Laura Rosenbury offered to lift the campus activists' suspensions less than a week later following after faculty issued public statements siding with encampment participants. Hirsi ultimately graduated from Barnard in May of this year, walking the stage with a Palestinian flag in hand, her Instagram page shows. It is unclear whether Hirsi's unemployment has any connection to her activities on campus, but a number of large employers, including ExxonMobil and the Sullivan & Cromwell law firm, stated at the time that they would not hire graduates who participated in pro-Hamas encampments. ""Harassment and intimidation, I think there's no place for that at those universities and certainly no place for that at a company like ExxonMobil,"" CEO Darren Woods told CNBC last year. One thing Hirsi isn't selling yet is the pair of oversized Versace glasses she wears prominently in several photos, which retail for about $250."

But Brooks laughed off the snafu on TikTok, posting a video of herself getting confidently up from a table only for her sisters to start cringing at her. At that point she turned around and the shot ran down the length of her outfit, so that the stains were in clear view on camera. The Baton Rouge-born clotheshorse poked fun at herself the in text over the video as well, writing: 'tries to be chic,' and then: 'Starts [blood emoji] at Wimbledon.' Fans leapt into the comments to praise her for being 'real' and 'NORMALIZING it,' with one writing: 'A canon event for all us girlies.' 'The one time you wear something non sheer and maxi,' joked one commenter with crying, praying and heart emoji - earning a like from Brooks. Brooks waved off the mishap and sat cheerfully in the audience at Wimbledon that day, with her sister Sarah Jane right beside her. The Louisiana native was dressed in a stylish ensemble that included a monochrome polka-dot top with fashion forward sheer accents. Letting her caramel hair cascade over her shoulders in luscious waves, she accentuated her unmistakable features with makeup. Brooks had another wardrobe malfunction in April at the Fashion Los Angeles Awards, where her structured dress drifted forward at one point and exposed her left nipple.

Email tips@dailymail.com Leonardo DiCaprio tried his best to keep a low-profile while exiting Jeff Bezos' new wife Lauren Sanchez's dinner party in Paris, France this week. The sighting comes less than two weeks after the Oscar-winner, 50, was branded a 'hypocrite' for attending the billionaire couple's $20million Italian nuptials. DiCaprio was brutally mocked online for seemingly trying to 'hide' from cameras during the three-day wedding by wearing a hat low down over his eyes and nose. And the Titanic star pulled a similar stunt on Tuesday night as he was photographed leaving the upscale Laperouse restaurant. Dressed in a casual all-black outfit, DiCaprio's famous face was barely visible behind an N95 and a black baseball cap, which he pulled down to cover his eyes. Excited fans watched as the actor was escorted to a nearby SUV by a well-dressed bodyguard. Missing from DiCaprio's side was his 27-year-old model girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti, who was his plus one to Sanchez and Bezos' controversial wedding. DiCaprio left shortly before dinner party host Sanchez, who wowed paparazzi in a busty red latex dress by Versace. The new Mrs. Bezos, 55, finished off the look with her hair sleek and straight, and carried a black crocodile Hermès Kelly bag, which typically has a resale value of over $50,000. Also in attendance was Sports Illustrated Swimsuit Issue model Brooks Nader. The runway maven, 28, looked equally as glamorous for Sanchez's get together in a totally sheer black halter blouse that left very little to the imagination and a pair of black capri pants. The dinner coincides with the start of Paris Fashion Week, which runs from July 7 to the 10. It also marked what appeared to be the first sighting of Sanchez since she and Amazon founder Bezos, 61, tied the knot in Venice, Italy last month. The luxe event, which not only featured their actual wedding but multiple themed parties and brunches, saw them surrounded by 200 friends and family, including DiCaprio and Brooks. A-listers like Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, and Kris Jenner were in attendance, as well as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. According to The Guardian, over 90 jets flew into the airport in the romantic city. Ellie Goulding performed at their reception, while R&B superstar Usher sang at their pajama-themed brunch the next day. The happy couple got married in a restored amphitheater on the island, as Sánchez wore a high-neck, long sleeve lace Dolce & Gabbana gown that took over 900 hours of atelier to make, as per Vogue. However, the nuptials were met with fierce backlash by locals who gathered in St Mark's Square, the iconic heart of Venice, to protest during the three-day event. There were criticisms regarding over-tourism, how much Bezos pays in taxes and his environmental impact. Being that DiCaprio prides himself on being an environmentalist and climate activist, fans were shocked to learn that he was among the Bezos wedding attendees. Photos of him wearing his low baseball cap and tuxedo as he hopped aboard a water taxi quickly went viral as fans roasted his bizarre wedding look. 'Leo trying to hide because he's embarrassed to been seen there or what?' one person penned. ' What a sellout. Youre a climate activist you say, Leo? 'Leonardo DiCaprio we can still see you…,' another added. Calling out the star's 'hypocrisy,' one fan tweeted out: 'Leo has great advice which he doesn't follow himself. I'm sure there's a word for that...' However, some social media users came to DiCaprio's defense as they tried to explain his unique style choices. 'He dresses like that pretty much all the time unless he's doing a big event or publicity, I think he doesn't want to be recognized/approached by the general public which honestly I would do the same if I happened to be famous,' one fan speculated, before adding: 'Gross of him to go to this regardless tho.' DiCaprio faced further backlash in the days following the wedding as he leaned back into his environmentalist work after partying it up with some of the wealthiest people in the world. Taking to Instagram, the star posted an update about a Chilean island called Guafo which is 'now protected.' Along with sharing a picture of the island, Leonardo explained that it has been purchased by a private owner - which will now keep it 'protected from coal mining, timber logging and other destructive industries.' The area will also become a national park and the star further penned that Guafo Island is 'critical to global biodiversity and the overall health of our planet.' DailyMail.com reached out to DiCaprio's rep for comment but never heard back. DiCaprio added that the island houses 'breeding populations of seabirds' and also 'boasts Magellanic Penguins and a breeding population of Endangered Marine Otters...' He has previously been open about his activism and a few months earlier in March, he slammed the Albanese government for giving the green light to a mine expansion in Western Australia. Over on Reddit, social media users called out DiCaprio for being a 'hypocrite' after he had flown to Italy just days prior for the Bezos-Sanchez wedding and slammed him for supporting Bezos amid Amazon's substantial carbon footprint. One penned, 'Leo is a great actor but I never believed that nonsense about him caring about the environment.' Another wrote, 'Because he's a hypocrite. He wants us to believe that he's environmentally frugal so that he can fly his private jets and use his private yachts. Leonardo DiCaprio has always been a hypocrite and a phony. 'Anyone who uses a private jet and a private yacht everywhere they go does not care about the environment. He wants us to limit our usage so he can continue with his extravagance,' they added. A fan also shared, 'Wealthy/famous people like this assume their influence on others outweighs the damages they cause personally. As if they are carbon neutral on the backs of others personal sacrifices.' 'Wow...."

Email tips@dailymail.com Newlywed Lauren Sanchez looked sensational in a red skintight dress as she enjoyed a night out in Paris, France with some of her A-list friends on Tuesday. It marks Sanchez's first public outing since she and Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos, 61, tied the knot during their lavish $50million Italian wedding weekend last month. Sanchez and Bezos hosted 200 elite guests during the controversial three-day extravaganza — which many dubbed the 'Wedding of the Century.' The celebration continued this past weekend as the couple spent their 'honeymoon' partying on a yacht with recently split couple, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom, in Capri. And on Tuesday night, a solo Sanchez ventured to Paris without her billionaire husband where she met up with Oscar-winners Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and model Brooks Nader and more stars for an upscale dinner at Laperouse restaurant. The new Mrs. Bezos, 55, made jaws drop upon arrival as she flashed her ample cleavage in a red latex dress by Versace, which retails for over $3,500. She finished off the look with her hair sleek and straight, and carried a black crocodile Hermès Kelly bag, which typically has a resale value of over $50,000. Sanchez was photographed exiting Laperouse, which is situated along the Seine and boasts private dining rooms, with a crew of security guards surrounding her. She smiled while being escorted to a nearby SUV as locals and paparazzi looked on in awe. Sanchez's model pal Nader put on an X-rated display for their night out in Paris by going braless under a black see-through pussy bow blouse. The shocking top left nothing to the imagination as Nader, 28, confidently exited Laperouse with a security guard in tow. The blonde bombshell completed her racy outfit with skintight capri pants, sky-high heels and a shiny black clutch. As for her glam, Nader's plump pout was drenched in lip gloss and her long hair looked extra voluminous for the invite-only occasion amid Paris Fashion Week. Nader's younger sister Sarah Jane Nader was also in attendance. The brunette beauty was pictured walking behind her model sister in a daringly low-cut top. DiCaprio — who was recently branded a 'hypocrite' for associating with Bezos — tried to keep a low-profile as he left the restaurant before Sanchez and Nader. Dressed in a casual all-black outfit, the 50-year-old famous face was barely visible behind an N95 and a black baseball cap, which he pulled down to cover his eyes. The look resembled viral photos from the Bezos-Sanchez wedding that showed a tuxedo-clad DiCaprio seemingly trying to 'hide' from cameras by wearing a hat low down over his eyes and nose. Missing from DiCaprio's side on Tuesday night was his supermodel girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti, 27. Instead, DiCaprio was joined by a single bodyguard as he made a beeline to a nearby chauffeured car parked outside of Laperouse. Penn, 64, rolled up the A-list gathering with his stunning 30-year-old girlfriend, Valeria Nicov. The Mystic River star looked slimmer than ever in a trendy neutral-toned outfit as Nicov, wearing a white blouse and black slacks, trailed behind him. The couple, who made their red carpet debut last December, were photographed walking into the restaurant separately. Socialite Natasha Poonawalla was also on hand for Sanchez's star-studded dinner in Paris. Bezos' absence from the dinner party was likely due to a scheduling conflict as he is expected to attend Allen & Co.'s annual leadership retreat in Sun Valley, Idaho this week. Days before Sanchez's Paris trip, the journalist and Bezos were spotted partying on a superyacht in the Mediterranean during what many believed was their honeymoon. The couple was joined by Katy Perry, Katy's ex-fiance Orlando Bloom and other friends as they soaked up in the sun over the weekend. However, DailyMail.com recently learned that the trip was technically not an official honeymoon for Bezos and Sanchez, who appeared to be enjoying their extended vacation following their Venice nuptials. The luxe three-day event, which not only featured their actual wedding but multiple themed parties and brunches, saw the couple surrounded by 200 friends and family. A-listers like Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, and Kris Jenner all made an appearance, as well as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Ellie Goulding performed at their reception, while Usher also sang at their pajama-themed brunch the next day. The happy couple got married in a restored amphitheater on the island, as Sánchez wore a high-neck, long sleeve lace Dolce & Gabbana gown that took over 900 hours of atelier to make, per Vogue. The gown featured a flared skirt, long veil, and a tight-fitting waist, with tons of buttons going up the middle. 'Very Lauren. Sexy, happy, not too serious, not too drama. Elegant but at the same time sensual,' Domenico Dolce told the outlet about the bride's dress. But the dress wasn't the only star of the show. The Blue Origin astronaut had many looks for the different occasions, including a pajama-themed party on their last night. Sanchez chose a strapless, dusty pink bustier Atelier Versace gown for the event, with bejeweled detailing all over the body - but it was her secret accessory that really stood out. Throughout the weekend, Lauren also wore many custom accessories that were a nod to her new last name, like a black rhinestone-encrusted black clutch bag that read, 'Mrs. Bezos' on it in silver gems. On the morning of her wedding, Sanchez stepped out in a cream, two-piece skirt suit by Dior, adding a personal touch as she wore a brown braided bracelet with diamond charms that read 'LB,' in honor of becoming Lauren Bezos. But for Sanchez, it's not about the dress or the accessories - at the end of the day, she's just happy to be married to Bezos, who she describes as the love of her life. 'I'm very happy,' she told the outlet. 'More than the dress, I'm happy that I'm getting married and I get to spend my life with my best friend, someone who sees me, someone who adores me, someone who I adore. I am the luckiest woman on the planet,' she shared."

And on Tuesday night, a solo Sanchez ventured to Paris without her billionaire husband where she met up with Oscar-winners DiCaprio, Penn and model Brooks Nader and more stars for an upscale dinner at Laperouse restaurant. The new Mrs. Bezos, 55, made jaws drop upon arrival as she flashed her ample cleavage in a red latex dress by Versace, which retails for over $3,500. She finished off the look with her hair sleek and straight, and carried a black crocodile Hermès Kelly bag, which typically has a resale value of over $50,000. Sanchez was photographed exiting Laperouse, which is situated along the Seine and boasts private dining rooms, with a crew of security guards surrounding her. She smiled while being escorted to a nearby SUV as locals and paparazzi looked on in awe. Sanchez's model pal Nader put on an X-rated display for their night out in Paris by going braless under a black see-through pussy bow blouse. The shocking top left nothing to the imagination as Nader, 28, confidently exited Laperouse with a security guard in tow. The blonde bombshell completed her racy outfit with skintight capri pants, sky-high heels and a shiny black clutch. As for her glam, Nader's plump pout was drenched in lip gloss and her long hair looked extra voluminous for the invite-only occasion amid Paris Fashion Week. Nader's younger sister Sarah Jane Nader was also in attendance. The brunette beauty was pictured walking behind her model sister in a daringly low-cut top. DiCaprio — who was recently branded a 'hypocrite' for associating with Bezos — tried to keep a low-profile as he left the restaurant before Sanchez and Nader. Dressed in a casual all-black outfit, the 50-year-old famous face was barely visible behind an N95 and a black baseball cap, which he pulled down to cover his eyes. The look resembled viral photos from the Bezos-Sanchez wedding that showed a tuxedo-clad DiCaprio seemingly trying to 'hide' from cameras by wearing a hat low down over his eyes and nose. Missing from DiCaprio's side on Tuesday night was his supermodel girlfriend Vittoria Ceretti, 27. Instead, DiCaprio was joined by a single bodyguard as he made a beeline to a nearby chauffeured car parked outside of Laperouse. Penn, 64, rolled up the A-list gathering with his stunning 30-year-old girlfriend, Valeria Nicov. The Mystic River star looked slimmer than ever in a trendy neutral-toned outfit as Nicov, wearing a white blouse and black slacks, trailed behind him. The couple, who made their red carpet debut last December, were photographed walking into the restaurant separately. Socialite Natasha Poonawalla was also on hand for Sanchez's star-studded dinner in Paris. Bezos' absence from the dinner party was likely due to a scheduling conflict as he is expected to attend Allen & Co.'s annual leadership retreat in Sun Valley, Idaho this week. Days before Sanchez's Paris trip, the journalist and Bezos were spotted partying on a superyacht in the Mediterranean during what many believed was their honeymoon. The couple was joined by Katy Perry, Katy's ex-fiance Orlando Bloom and other friends as they soaked up in the sun over the weekend. However, DailyMail.com recently learned that the trip was technically not an official honeymoon for Bezos and Sanchez, who appeared to be enjoying their extended vacation following their Venice nuptials. The luxe three-day event, which not only featured their actual wedding but multiple themed parties and brunches, saw the couple surrounded by 200 friends and family. A-listers like Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, and Kris Jenner all made an appearance, as well as Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. Ellie Goulding performed at their reception, while Usher also sang at their pajama-themed brunch the next day. The happy couple got married in a restored amphitheater on the island, as Sánchez wore a high-neck, long sleeve lace Dolce & Gabbana gown that took over 900 hours of atelier to make, per Vogue. The gown featured a flared skirt, long veil, and a tight-fitting waist, with tons of buttons going up the middle. 'Very Lauren. Sexy, happy, not too serious, not too drama. Elegant but at the same time sensual,' Domenico Dolce told the outlet about the bride's dress. But the dress wasn't the only star of the show. The Blue Origin astronaut had many looks for the different occasions, including a pajama-themed party on their last night. Sanchez chose a strapless, dusty pink bustier Atelier Versace gown for the event, with bejeweled detailing all over the body - but it was her secret accessory that really stood out. Throughout the weekend, Lauren also wore many custom accessories that were a nod to her new last name, like a black rhinestone-encrusted black clutch bag that read, 'Mrs. Bezos' on it in silver gems. On the morning of her wedding, Sanchez stepped out in a cream, two-piece skirt suit by Dior, adding a personal touch as she wore a brown braided bracelet with diamond charms that read 'LB,' in honor of becoming Lauren Bezos. But for Sanchez, it's not about the dress or the accessories - at the end of the day, she's just happy to be married to Bezos, who she describes as the love of her life. 'I'm very happy,' she told the outlet. 'More than the dress, I'm happy that I'm getting married and I get to spend my life with my best friend, someone who sees me, someone who adores me, someone who I adore. I am the luckiest woman on the planet,' she shared. Adblock test (Why?)"

Where most people usually spend their honeymoon enjoying a romantic break, the Amazon founder and his new bride opted to invite their famous pals to join them on the celebrations. Over the weekend, Katy Perry and Orlando Bloom were spotted with newlyweds Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez on what appeared to be part of the couple's honeymoon. Katy and Orlando, who said they are now focusing on co-parenting their daughter Daisy Dove, hopped on board Bezos' superyacht in the Mediterranean with their little girl. A few days later, Lauren jetted off to Paris without her new husband to enjoy a night out with a host of A-list friends, including Leonardo DiCaprio, Sean Penn and Brooks Nader. The famous pals were pictured leaving Laperouse restaurant after a lavish dinner. Lauren, 55, looked out of this world in a red latex dress from Versace. She completed the look with a black Hermes handbag and black sunglasses as she made her way out. Brooks went all out in capris, a mesh halterneck top with bow detailing and a black purse. Brooks' younger sister, Sarah Jane Nader, also joined in on the night. Sean and Leonardo, on the other hand, opted for casual looks as they walked out in baggy trousers, simple T-shirts and light jackets. Leonardo kept hidden in a black face mask with a cap pushed down over his face. Last month, Jeff and Lauren tied the knot in Venice despite threats and protests by anti-capitalists and locals. The 25-minute wedding ceremony saw the pair exchange vows in front of around 200 guests, including a number of high-profile celebrities. In attendance were the Kardashian-Jenners, Orlando Bloom and Oprah Winfrey, as well as Ivanka Trump and her family. Rania Al Abdullah, the Queen of Jordan also watched on, as did supermodels, actors and business-people. Guests were welcomed by a gospel choir, with the singers performing a rendition of Whitney Houston's Higher Love as the bride and groom entered. Most guests partied well into the early hours of Saturday, but some celebs slipped away early. Kim and Khloe Kardashian left the do early and had already left the country by the time some of the other guests woke up, having being spotted at Venice airport early in the morning. Jeff kept his party gifts fancy, giving his male guests ViBi Venezia blue velvet slippers. But Sanchez partook in some shameless marketing, handing out black open-toe slippers from Amazon, promoting the business empire that made her now-husband a billionaire. According to a well-placed insider involved in the event planning, it's said the couple were already legally married for at least a month before the wedding. They said: “They have been married for at least a month, more than a month. The marriage is fully legal and took place in America under American law.” Follow Mirror Celebs on TikTok, Snapchat, Instagram, Twitter,"

wi_85C2F4DBF39A2469ED610B1E5982177C,2025-07-09 09:03:19,zh-tw,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[zh-tw]萊恩·墨菲新劇《美國愛情故事》聚焦 Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy，再次喚起對這位90年代時尚偶像的關注。 她的風格不只定義了極簡美學，也見證了名人引領時尚的新時代。 2025年6月萊恩墨菲（Ryan Murphy）的《美國愛情故事》（American Love Story）釋出前導，這部以Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy為主角的影集，也讓這位一代時尚偶像的風格再度躍上時尚媒體版面。 而這或許正是影劇的力量，好萊塢總有點石成金的魔法，當時光倒轉到Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy引領風潮的90年代，她的崛起似乎也映照了當時的時尚氛圍，名人開始成為時尚靈感的核心，打破了超模的獨霸地位，時尚產業也就此迎來了一輪影響至今的革新，精品世界的輪廓也正式從名流世界走入了大眾視野。 告別超模時代之後
 90 年代初的時尚界被譽為超模世代，以Linda Evangelista、Cindy Crawford、Christy Turlington、Naomi Campbell以及Tatjana Patitz為首的「The Big Five」等一眾超模引領時尚圈。 不過當全球經濟進入衰退，極簡和街頭Grunge風格崛起，這股超模狂潮最終在90年代中期劃下句點，時尚圈也就此邁向全新時代。 1996年葛妮絲派特洛 Gwyneth Paltrow登上美國版Vogue八月號封面，儘管並非第一位登上封面的好萊塢女星，但事業起步之際即成為封面人物，加上內頁一張與時任男友布萊德彼特的親密合照，事業、愛情雙收的故事激起了大眾的好奇帶動了銷售，也為時尚雜誌的發展帶來轉捩點。 在那個演員與模特兒分眾明顯的年代，Vogue率先從時尚既定印象中解脫，透過名人創造了一條與大眾溝通的全新道路，讓時尚不再那麼遙不可及。 「在1990年代之前，所有領域似乎各自獨立，拍電影的人就拍電影，不會跟時尚人士往來。」 導演貝茲魯曼Baz Luhrmann回憶起當年的場景，提到藝術與時尚在90年代開始聚合。 1996年他的電影《羅密歐與茱麗葉：後現代激情篇》（Romeo + Juliet），便找來Dolce & Gabbana、Prada 和 Yves Saint Laurent打造戲服，讓李奧納多·狄卡皮歐及克萊兒·丹妮絲，用新世代的時尚語言詮釋經典；隔年，Jean Paul Gaultier為盧貝松的科幻巨作《第五元素》（The Fifth Element）設計一系列的戲服，其前衛且充滿未來感的設計，讓電影化身成一場極具風格的時尚狂想。 改變紅毯文化的禮服
 在作品之外，90年代初期影星們刻意輕鬆著裝，顯示自己演員專業的氛圍也慢慢瓦解。 1994年，Elizabeth Hurley穿上Versace安全別針洋裝現身電影《妳是我今生的新娘》的新娘首映，在當年相對大膽的造型攻佔媒體版面讓Versace一夕聲名大噪；1995年烏瑪舒曼Uma Thurman的薰衣草色雪紡禮服，也給了Prada全球性的舞台，讓品牌成為當時時尚圈的夢幻逸品。 當義大利品牌們積極與影星合作擴大影響力，法國品牌們也終於走出高級訂製的名流圈層，1997年妮可基嫚Nicole Kidman身著彼時剛上任Dior創意總監的John Galliano 刺繡高訂禮服出席奧斯卡頒獎典禮，這條被譽為改變好萊塢紅毯進程的裙子在隔日成為各大新聞的焦點，也讓影人們真正迎向與品牌合作的紅毯時代。 至此，奢侈品品牌們紛紛成立名人訂製部門替明星們著裝，名人們的商業潛力也讓時尚產業開啟了全新面貌，而以上三件禮服的重要性，也從它們各自擁有專屬的維基百科頁面不言而喻。 影劇驅動時尚大眾化
 提到時尚大眾化便不得不提1998年首播的《慾望城市》，當第三季主角凱莉對著歹徒說「It's not a bag, it's a Baguette」後來的故事大家都知道了，Fendi的Baguette包意外成了影視經典，也改變了這部劇的命運。 在那個電視劇被認為無法匹敵電影的年代，奢侈品大牌進駐讓《慾望城市》開啟了精品大門，品牌爭相合作也讓時尚走進大眾的茶餘飯後。 兩千年代的影劇也在這樣的氛圍下，創造出《花邊教主》、《穿著Prada的惡魔》、《購物狂的異想世界》等帶動時尚熱度的作品。 當片中的服飾成為大眾討論的話題，影劇角色成為品牌的非官方代言人，造型師與設計師的名字也透過流行文化走進觀眾的日常語彙。 不過當時間推進到近代，儘管仍有像《艾蜜莉在巴黎》這樣有著過往時尚影劇影子的作品，但在整體影視產業更加強調寫實敘寫的環境之下，《王冠》精準復刻皇室穿搭、《高校十八禁》的美式高校、《繼承之戰》掀起的靜奢狂潮，又或是Jonathan Anderson一手打造的《挑戰者》網球世界，戲服忠實呈現某個圈層或場域，當代影劇時尚與大眾的關係，也由戲服移轉至更具媒體曝光度的戰場——紅毯。 過去幾年「Method Dressing方法著裝」儼然成了電影宣傳的行銷賣點，電影公司們加大力度投資影星們主題式的紅毯造型：Margot Robbie的芭比套裝、Zendaya的末世沙丘風格禮服、Cynthia Erivo和Ariana Grande長達一整年的《Wicked》雙色女巫穿搭，時尚品牌和好萊塢傾足全力在這個社群世代，用唯有好萊塢才有的方式展示時尚的不同面向。"

Noi l'abbiamo presa in aeroporto con Dollar ed è stato super comodo. 🌴 Vi consiglio di fermarvi almeno 2 notti a Miami centro (noi siamo stati allo smartbrickellhotel ) e poi magari altre 2-3 notti zona Miami Beach. Evitate di dormire troppo vicino an Ocean Drive, di sera è parecchio rumorosa. 🍸 Un rooftop elegante che mi è piaciuto tanto: Sugar, in centro. 🪩 Di sera Miami Beach può sembrare un po' pacchiana e “too much” (almeno per me 😅). Preferisco la zona vicino a Bayfront Park o Brickell City Center. 🥥 Di giorno però Miami Beach ha vibes bellissime: spiagge enormi e le famose casette colorate dei bagnini! Se potete, fate un salto anche a Key Biscayne per il mare. 🌊 L'acqua è stupenda, ma occhio ad andare troppo al largo: noi ci siamo ritrovati uno squalo a riva 😂 🍔 Prendete un hamburger da burgermeistermiami e mangiatelo sulla spiaggia. 🎇 Se riuscite, veniteci per il 4 luglio: fuochi d'artificio sulla spiaggia, un'atmosfera incredibile. 🥗 Per un pranzo più healthy vi consiglio puravidamiami o wholefoods 🌩️ Se capitate in bassa stagione come noi, aspettatevi qualche pioggia: durano pochissimo e vi godrete comunque mare e città. 🇨🇺 Da Little Havana mi aspettavo un po' di più, ma fermatevi in un locale con musica cubana e provate un sandwich cubano. 🚇 Prendete il Metromover (gratuito!) per fare un giro del centro, merita. 🏙️ La zona che ho amato di più è la Miami Riverwalk: elegante, grattacieli nuovi e yacht ovunque che passano ogni due secondi, bellissima davvero! 🦎 Ah, ci sono animali strani in giro… è normale! 😂 🌅 Il tramonto rosa su Miami Beach? Pazzesco. 🍝 Se vi va, provate la Versace Mansion a pranzo (la sera è un po' troppo turistica): prezzi alti, ma posto elegante e cucina buonissima, perfettamente in linea con lo stile Versace. 🖤 godetevela e rilassatevi, non programmate tutto per filo e per segno, “lasciatevi andare”, Miami è anche questo✨ Voi ci siete già stati? Vi è piaciuta? 🤍 #miami #guidamiami"

mov_ABB755A23E788B1CC2DBDAA1E0B168BE,2025-07-09 15:00:00,en,WEB,"  Richmond outlet mall has welcomed brands such as Under Armour, Zwilling and Karl Lagerfeld for their first stores in the region Ten years after its launch on July 9, 2015, the McArthurGlen Outlet Vancouver Airport is bustling with shoppers, and its executives say they plan to expand the region's only outlet centre. It is a testament that retail success can come when developers target a clear niche and there is unmet demand in the market. “We're working through permitting and some leasing right now, and we'll have an opening date announcement of Phase 3 in the next couple of months,” said Robert Thurlow, general manager of what is largely a mall with tenants that sell off-price merchandise. His expected 63,000-square-foot expansion would enlarge the Richmond mall to approximately 387,000 square feet of leasable space. An expansion has been in the works for years. The mall was a success from day one. Mall executives back then counted about 160,000 shoppers in the mall's first four days, and traffic jams on roads leading to the complex disrupted vehicle flow for those heading to the nearby Vancouver International Airport. Months later it won an award for being the world's best outlet centre. The mall initially had about 240,000 square feet of leasable space, of which 156,000 square feet was leased on opening day. Within three years, the mall had filled about 96 per cent of that space with tenants, Thurlow told BIV. An 84,000-square-foot Phase 2 expansion opened toward the southeast in 2019, and Thurlow said Phase 3 is set to add another 63,000 square feet to the northeast of the original mall footprint. Fueling the expansion is retail success. Thurlow pinned the mall retailers' average annual sales per square foot at about $1,350. The mall does not take part in the International Council of Shopping Centers' (ICSC) annual ranking of Canadian shopping centres by that metric. If it had done so, it would have last year ranked No. 5 in Canada, and No. 3 in B.C., behind CF Pacific Centre's $1,454 per square foot, and CF Richmond Centre's $1,359 per square foot on the ICSC rankings. “McArthurGlen is an extremely well-performing shopping centre,” Retail Insider owner and consultant Craig Patterson told BIV. “It's got a value proposition to it. It's a mall that has stores that are known to have lower prices, and it has got a compelling mix of brands. People will line up for certain brands that are on sale, and McArthurGlen has a good number of those brands.” The mall's largest retail tenant is Ralph Lauren, which leases about 20,000 square feet, according to Thurlow. That location is Ralph Lauren's first outlet location in Metro Vancouver, he said. The clothing chain has had other full-price stores in the region but never a store that carried off-price merchandise such as out-of-season clothing or products specifically made for an outlet store, according to Thurlow. Brands that opened their first-ever store in the region – full price or outlet – at the McArthurGlen Outlet Vancouver Airport mall include Under Armour, Zwilling and Karl Lagerfeld, Thurlow said. The first Marc Jacobs outlet store in Western Canada opened at the mall earlier this year, he added. His mall caters to a wide range of tastes and price ranges, with Versace being a luxury store that has its only store in Metro Vancouver at the mall. To mark the 10th anniversary, the mall has encouraged tenants to offer special discounts. Mall management has also arranged for live music, special events and contests with prizes, such as a round-trip Helijet excursion to Victoria to stay two nights at the Fairmont Empress hotel.

mov_9257099E31BD4CE14E62334D9F58F2C1,2025-07-09 16:14:47,en,WEB,"  Just weeks after donning a high-neck, long-sleeved lace gown for her wedding to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, has made her first public appearance as a newlywed—quickly returning to her old fashion habits. The 55-year-old stepped out in Paris on Tuesday night for dinner with model wearing a skintight, fire-red dress by Versace that, for many, looked more clubwear than couture. Netizens, as usual, were ruthless in their commentary, with many wondering whether she could breathe as the corset-style bodice tightly pushed her cleavage up. “That dress is so tight her fake boobs are ,” one commenter mocked. Another sniped, “Was that her wedding present, bigger balloons? Lauren Sanchez got roasted by the internet for stepping out in skin-tight bodysuit that compressed her chest The $3,515 dress, currently listed on luxury resale site Vestiaire Collective, clung to her frame and hit just above the knees, putting her legs on full display alongside strappy black heels and a $50,000 Hermès Kelly bag. For many viewers, the contrast between her face and her knees was striking, serving as a reminder that while cosmetic procedures can smooth a face, they don't extend to the legs. “The knees show it all,” one user wrote. “There is nothing real about this woman except being a home wrecker and gold digger.” Ever since she attended Donald Trump's inauguration wearing a revealing white blazer that brought plenty of attention to her chest, Sanchez Bezos has been at the center of ongoing scrutiny. Her cleavage at the event was so prominent it became a meme in itself—circulating widely alongside photos of a visibly distracted Mark Zuckerberg, who appeared unable to look away. “She better watch or she will puncture one of her implants, stuffing it into these getups,” one user wrote. Her image took another hit earlier this year with the fallout from Blue Origin's all-female spaceflight, a mission she led alongside pop star Katy Perry and four other women. Though touted by the Bezos-owned aerospace company as a historic achievement—marking the first all-female flight beyond the Kármán line since 1963—the launch was quickly dismissed by many as a tone-deaf vanity project. Sanchez' marriage to Bezos is her third, with their relationship starting while both were engaged to their respective previous partners @purepeople ✨ Lauren Sanchez et Brooks Nader ont été aperçues ce soir à Paris, se rendant ensemble à un dîner dans la capitale, en marge de la Fashion Week Haute Couture. Complices et ultra stylées, les deux amies ont attiré tous les regards avec leurs looks glamour, entre élégance et vibes parisiennes. Une apparition remarquée sous les flashs dans les rues de la Ville Lumière. #LaurenSanchez #BrooksNader #ParisNights #HauteCouture #FashionWeek #BestImage #purepeople ♬ son original – Purepeople The dinner, part of Paris Haute Couture Week, was also attended by Brooks Nader who wore capri pants and a sheer black halter blouse. While both women turned heads in the French capital, it was Sanchez Bezos that captured the attention of netizens. “She looks very uncomfortable,” another netizen wrote. “Not sure how she even breathed in the dress.” Her appearance comes fresh off the heels of her opulent Venetian wedding to Bezos, which featured a restored amphitheater ceremony, a Dolce & Gabbana gown that allegedly took over 900 hours to make, and performances by Ellie Goulding and Usher. The high-profile guest list included Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Ivanka Trump, and Bill Gates. Lauren Sanchez Bezos' marriage to Jeff Bezos is her third. Her first husband was former NFL tight end Tony Gonzalez, with whom she shares a son, Nikko, born in 2001. Her second marriage, far more high-profile, was to Patrick Whitesell, a powerful Hollywood agent and the executive chairman of Endeavor. They married in 2005 and had two children together. Sanchez and Bezos began their relationship while she was still married to Whitesell and he was still married to MacKenzie Scott. The affair, which was exposed via leaked text messages in 2019, ended both marriages and set off one of the most expensive divorces in history. Sanchez declared herself happy, and said that Bezos is not only a husband to her, but her best friend @taoualitamar #laurensanchez wife of #jeffbezos in #paris ♬ son original – AMAR TAOUALIT For Sanchez Bezos, the social media noise seems irrelevant. “I'm very happy,” she told the press after the wedding. “More than the dress, I'm happy that I'm getting married and I get to spend my life with my best friend, someone who sees me, someone who adores me, someone who I adore. I am the luckiest woman on the planet.” While many defended her and accused her detractors of being jealous of her success, even her fans believe her love life has been more strategic than passionate. “You don't bag three top-5% men in one lifetime without being a bit strategic, transactional, and calculated about your love life,” a user wrote. Among her fanbase, the 55-year-old is praised for maintaining an alluring image and refusing to conform to what's expected of her considering her age and status. “She is extremely fit, well-groomed, and stylish in a seductive way while most other women her age tend to ditch that kind of 'bombshell' sex appeal for a more classy 'wifey material' look,” a fan stated. “No class!” Netizens took to social media to criticize Sanchez Bezos for her dress"

When I first moved here, I thought I'd cracked the code. Rent? Sorted. Groceries? Done. Uni and a part-time job? Balanced. But then life did what it does best — humbled me Because no one warns you about the invisible costs. The kind that sneak up on you on a random Tuesday. The  kind that don't show up on your budget spreadsheet but always seem to show up in real life. Like you step out for “just eggs and milk” and come back £30 poorer. Or your laundry card suddenly needs another £10 and you're down to your last pair of socks. Or your train to London is £40 one way because you booked 3 days late. It's not even about being reckless. It's just… life here is expensive in ways that are hard to plan for. Especially when you're new, learning the system, figuring things out, and trying to keep it all together on a student budget. And the truth is Living here is not just rent + groceries + WiFi It's also: — Bus passes, Uber when it rains (which is always) — Indian groceries and takeaways when you're too tired to cook — Bedding, toilet rolls, painkillers, scissors, socks, water filters — Spontaneous society events, someone's birthday, — Emotional support coffee ☕ That's why I'm saying this: An emergency fund isn't a rich people thing. It's a survival buffer. You don't need to save £1,000 overnight. Start with £5 a week. Or whatever you can. It's for that one week where everything goes wrong. And trust me — there will be a week like that. Save this post. It'll make sense later.

mov_F0D8ABD6FF07FF2C7AE29F35C49C1B1A,2025-07-09 21:08:47,en,WEB,"  Numerator's research on the first two days of the event found that 30 percent of shoppers are clicking on apparel or footwear, tying with household essentials. Amazon's mini Christmas in July has consumers clicking on fashion — and there are more apparel brands in the promotional mix, including vintage designer style from ReBag as well as looks from Michael Kors, Naadam and more. Prime Day, which extended to four days this year and ends on Friday, has become a fixture on the retail calendar, prompting competing deals from other retailers. Altogether, retailers are expected to see $23.8 billion in sales, or the equivalent of two Black Fridays, according to Adobe. At Amazon, the event has had a strong fashion start. Numerator is tracking the e-commerce giant's Prime Day take, studying the activity of shoppers at 22,411 households and surveying 2,248 buyers during the sale's first two days. Thirty percent of buyers snatched up Prime Day apparel and footwear — tying for the top spot with cleaning products and other household essentials, according to the data and tech company. But in keeping with the general sense of caution in the market, consumers are being very calculated as they spend. Fifty-one percent of shoppers bought items that they'd been waiting to buy on sale and 37 percent of shoppers bought the same items they typically buy on Amazon. Numerator pegged the average order size on Prime Day at $57.12 and said 51 percent of households have made two or more orders, upping the average household spend to $126.26. Two-thirds of the Prime Day items have sold for under $20 while only 3 percent are over $100.

mov_3AD6BD618DC631296379354BAC744C8E,2025-07-10 06:26:18,en,WEB,"  Newlywed Lauren Sánchez-Bezos has made her first public appearance since her lavish Venetian wedding to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, and she did so in unforgettable style. Stepping out in Paris for dinner with model Brooks Nader and her sister, Sarah Jane Nader, Sánchez stunned in a striking red latex dress by Versace. The eye-catching gown, retailing for around £2,700 ($3,515), featured a corset bodice that accentuated her curves, a ruched skirt, and a hemline just above the knee. Paired with strappy black heels and her signature confidence, the look turned heads across the City of Light. The dinner took place at the luxurious Laperouse restaurant after Sánchez was seen leaving the historic Hôtel de Crillon. Paris served as the perfect backdrop for her glamorous return, especially with the city buzzing for Haute Couture Week, running from 7 to 10 July. The evening marked Sánchez's first public sighting since her whirlwind wedding celebrations in Venice just last month. She and Bezos tied the knot in a multi-day extravaganza attended by 200 close friends and family. The guest list was star-studded, featuring Kim Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Kris Jenner, and Bill Gates. Ellie Goulding performed at the reception, and Usher entertained guests at a playful pyjama-themed brunch the following day. For the ceremony, Sánchez wore a breathtaking Dolce & Gabbana lace gown inspired by screen legend Sophia Loren. The gown, featuring a high neck, long sleeves, and a sweeping veil, reportedly took over 900 hours to create in the atelier. She complemented it with a flared skirt and an intricately buttoned waist, embodying timeless elegance and cinematic glamour. During other events across the multi-day celebration, she showcased her bold sense of style: a gold corseted Schiaparelli couture dress at the welcome dinner and a rose-pink atelier Versace gown adorned with Swarovski crystals at their 'Dolce Notte' party. Each look highlighted her confident and sensual aesthetic, perfectly balancing drama and sophistication. Her return to Paris carries special meaning. The city hosted her unforgettable bachelorette festivities, where she celebrated with friends in a series of sheer and lacy looks that foreshadowed her bridal style. The recent red Versace ensemble echoed this playful spirit, capturing her fearless approach to fashion while marking a new chapter as a newlywed. The ensemble was completed with a black crocodile Hermès Kelly bag — estimated to be worth over £39,000 ($50,000) — and her hair worn sleek and straight for a polished finish. While Sánchez enjoyed her stylish evening in Paris, Bezos was expected to attend Allen & Co.'s annual leadership retreat in Sun Valley, a private gathering known for attracting influential figures from the worlds of tech and business. Lauren Sánchez Bezos has shown that her post-wedding glow extends far beyond romance, radiating through her bold fashion choices and undeniable confidence. Her striking Paris appearance blends glamour, sophistication, and a hint of nostalgia — a true celebration of love, style, and self-expression."

mov_52CE45FF49FCDDBE48F7DC4F64223509,2025-07-10 15:47:15,en,WEB,"  Anne Hathaway's style has historically (and understandably) leaned high-end: Bvlgari bags, Moncler coats, Versace suits. What else would the actor who gave us Andy Sachs wear? But back in December 2021, she proved that her luxurious style doesn't necessarily require luxury price tags. On a date night with husband Adam Shulman in New York City, Hathaway carried a $120 JW Pei Maze bag—and thanks to Amazon Prime Day, you can snag the exact same one for just $96. Courtesy of brand JW Pei Maze Crossbody $120 $96 (20% off) Amazon Hathaway's choice isn't too surprising when you consider JW Pei's dedicated celebrity following. Selena Gomez wore another of the brand's bags (also 20% off for Prime Day) to the 2024 Golden Globes alongside a couture gown. Gigi Hadid, Emily Ratajkowksi, and Hailey Bieber have also been spotted in the label, which is readily available on Amazon. In case you're not familiar, Prime Day is Amazon's biggest sale of the year, and it's double the usual length for 2025: The deals kicked off on July 8 and continue through Friday, July 11. Like many of the best markdowns—including another on one of Katie Holmes's go-to bags—you can only access JW Pei's sale prices with an Amazon Prime membership. (Sign up here.) While most colorways of that Chanel-esque Maze bag are now sold out, the rest of JW Pei's catalog is worth a look, considering it very rarely goes on sale. Shop more editor-approved favorites, including trendy east-west bags and a croc-embossed option that would feel right at home in an Anne Hathaway look, below.

Vanessa Kirby stepped into shine and structure for Thursday's London premiere of “The Fantastic Four: First Steps,” wearing Aquazzura's Minute Sandal 105 in metallic silver — the latest entry in her sculptural maternity footwear streak.QUES The Italian-made stilettos featured mirrored leather uppers, two slim straps and a high, tapered heel. A back zip created a clean finish at the ankle, and the brand's signature gold plaque was visible on the sole. The 105mm silhouette added lift without disrupting the overall proportion. Related Stories Kirby paired the sandals with a beaded turquoise dress from Loewe's spring 2025 collection. The strapless midi-length look, styled by Andrew Mukamal, was constructed entirely of layered bead strands that created fringe-like movement across the body. The runway version featured a shorter hemline and metallic underlayer, but Kirby's custom iteration removed any lining to emphasize the vertical drape. Combined with the clean stiletto, the full look felt visually elongated. This marked Kirby's latest footwear-forward look on the “Fantastic Four: First Steps” press tour. Earlier this week in Paris, she wore metallic wraparound stilettos with a lilac Givenchy halter dress. In Mexico, she styled two different Manolo Blahnik silhouettes — including the black snakeskin Paloma heel — with cutout knits and a teal Schiaparelli gown. And at the Alabama trailer launch in February, she wore pointed PVC stilettos with vintage Versace. Across each appearance, Kirby has relied on heels with clean lines and exaggerated finishes — think eye-catching metallics, sheer panels and snakeskin — to ground dresses that range from architectural to body-conscious. “The Fantastic Four: First Steps” marks the Marvel franchise's official reboot under Disney, introducing a new cast led by Kirby, Pedro Pascal, Joseph Quinn and Ebon Moss-Bachrach. Directed by Matt Shakman, the film serves as both an origin story and launchpad for the characters' integration into the broader MCU, ahead of their expected crossover appearances in “Avengers: Secret Wars.” The film opens in U.S. theaters on July 25.

El propio Nicolas Sarkozy, que también está siendo investigado, ya ha sido condenado en dos ocasiones. Y ella siempre ha estado al lado del que considera el hombre de su vida. Sobre su historia de amor, que surgió el 13 de noviembre de 2007 en una cena organizada por el empresario de publicidad Jacques Séguéla, pueden saberse los detalles gracias al libro 'Nicolas Sarkozy and Carla Bruni: The True Story'. “Fue inmediato. No esperaba que él fuese tan divertido y vital. Su aspecto, su encanto y su inteligencia me sedujeron”, contó la propia Carla Bruni respecto a aquella primera cita. Carla Bruni conoció a Nicolas Sarkozy durante una cena en noviembre de 2007, gracias a un amigo en común. Aparecieron juntos en público por primera vez en diciembre de 2007, pasando un día en Disneyland París. Todo fue muy rápido entre ellos. Carla Bruni se casó con el Presidente en ejercicio en febrero de 2008, convirtiéndose así en Primera Dama de Francia. La pareja tuvo una hija, Giulia, el 19 de octubre de 2011. Nicolas Sarkozy estaba recién separado de Cécilia Ciganer Albéniz, que se había marchado a Nueva York con Richard Attias, y se enamoró perdidamente de la modelo y cantante. Desde entonces, Carla Bruni y Nicolas Sarkozy parecen sentir un amor apasionado el uno por el otro. Aunque la cantante ha sido durante mucho tiempo una devoradora de hombres -y ella no lo oculta-, parece que su pasado sulfuroso ya quedó verdaderamente atrás. Junto al expresidente francés tuvo a su hija Giulia, que vino al mundo el 19 de octubre de 2011 en la clínica de La Muette. Y actualmente, Carla Bruni también está volcada en la educación de una hija en plena adolescencia.

Close Princess Diana on June 17, 1997. Credit: Getty Though Princess Diana wore Chanel tweed suits earlier in her royal life, in her later years—and especially after her 1996 divorce—she found it difficult to wear Chanel for the most heartbreaking reason. The brand's interlocked Cs iconic logo reminded her too much of Prince Charles and Camilla Parker Bowles—whose affair dominated much of Diana's 15-year marriage to Charles. As Diana herself said in a 1995 interview, there were three people in her marriage, so it was a bit crowded. In the final years of her life, Princess Diana was a fan of many designer labels—think Versace and Dior, for starters—but one fashion house she avoided? Chanel—and for the most heartbreaking reason. It's not because she wasn't a fan of their clothes—it boiled down to her husband Prince Charles's longstanding affair with Camilla Parker Bowles, an affair that had plagued much of their marriage. Chanel, of course, is known for its interlocking Cs—and this reminded the Princess of Wales too much of Charles and Camilla. Because of Chanel's iconic logo, Diana “could no longer bring herself” to wear the brand, People reported. Princess Diana wearing Chanel earlier in her royal life. Getty After marrying in 1981, Charles and Diana separated in 1992 and finalized their divorce in 1996—just one year before her untimely death. Though she had worn Chanel tweed suits early in her royal life, after her divorce, Diana couldn't wear Chanel because, as Australian designer Jayson Brundson told Harper's Bazaar, “She said, 'No, I can't wear linked Cs, the double C.” Brundson styled Diana for a hospital charity event during what would ultimately become her last visit Down Under in 1996. After choosing a pair of Chanel shoes to compliment her cream Versace skirt suit, Diana demurred at wearing them. “I asked why, and she said, 'It's Camilla and Charles,'” Brundson recalled. Princess Diana in Sydney, Australia on November 1, 1996. Getty Princess Diana in Versace on October 31, 1996 in Sydney, Australia. Getty “It was definitely the timing, it being post-divorce,” he continued. “She would have seen linked Cs, and they would have just reminded her of Charles and Camilla. The shoes were quite boldly Chanel—I think they had gold linked Cs on them. And I think for photo optics, people would have honed in on that considering it was so fresh after the divorce, as well.” Adding insult to injury, during her marriage to Charles, Diana found a pair of cufflinks Charles owned engraved with interlocked Cs—which she interpreted as an homage to Charles and Camilla. “It's hard to believe that anyone as intelligent and well-read as the Prince of Wales could be so stupid—so utterly incapable of imagining what a new wife might conclude if her husband carried a photograph of his old girlfriend in his diary,” royal biographer Penny Junor wrote in her biography of Camilla called The Duchess: The Untold Story. Princess Diana in Chanel earlier in her royal life. Getty Speaking to Andrew Morton for his bombshell 1992 biography about her called Diana: Her True Story, Diana recalled Charles sending Camilla flowers with a signed card reading “To Gladys from Fred”—their nicknames for one another. “[I met her] very early on,” Diana said of Camilla (via People). “I was introduced to the circle, but obviously I was a threat. I was a very young girl, but I was a threat. We always had discussions about Camilla, though. I once heard him on the telephone in his bath on his handheld set saying, 'Whatever happens, I will always love you.' I told him afterwards that I had listened at the door, and we had a filthy row.” About two weeks before their wedding on July 29, 1981, someone in Charles's office told Diana that he had a bracelet made for Camilla with “G” and “F” (for Gladys and Fred) intertwined on it. “I was devastated,” Diana said.

So we made light of it.” Diana added that, on their honeymoon, she noticed cufflinks on her husband's wrists—“Two Cs entwined like the Chanel Cs,” she said. “Got it in one; knew exactly.

Tuy được gọi là “đám cưới thế kỷ,” sự kiện cũng gây tranh cãi. Nhiều người dân Venice hoan nghênh, coi đây là dịp quảng bá du lịch, nhưng không ít ý kiến lo ngại thành phố dần biến thành “sân chơi của giới siêu giàu.”"

Un personaje clave en la ficción es el que interpreta Griselda Siciliani. La actriz se pone en la piel de Zulema Yoma, quien fue esposa del líder político y es madre de Zulemita y Carlos Menem Jr. Además de su interpretación, la artista muestra los atuendos típicos de la época. Precisamente, 4 looks fueron los que más llamaron la atención de los espectadores. Cuáles son los looks clásicos de los '90 que lleva Griselda Siciliani en Menem, la serie Griselda Siciliani es la encargada de personificar a Zulema Yoma en la nueva serie biográfica de Carlos Sául Menem, que ya se encuentra disponible en Prime Video. Por esta razón, la artista pertenece al reparto principal de la historia junto a Leonardo Sbaraglia, quien hace del expresidente. A lo largo de los seis capítulos, la actriz luce diferentes vestuarios que solía usar Zulema en aquel entonces. Desde piezas sofisticadas a looks más casuales para el día a día. De hecho, uno de ellos está compuesto por una camisa de una reconocida firma, que en los años '90 causaba furor. Se trata de una prenda de seda, diseñada por Gianni Versace, de estilo sofisticado y maximalismo bastante común en aquella época. Además, su corte holgado y fluido refuerza la estética retro y glam que se buscó para recrear esta escena. Otro look que llamó la atención es el tapado de piel que luce Griselda Siciliani en una de las tomas junto a su compañero Leonardo Sbaraglia como Menem. Este abrigo de piel sintética y diseño animal print fue otro ítem típico de la moda noventosa. Su uso reflejaba lujo, poder, estatus y sofisticación en aquellos tiempos y Zulema Yoma lo sabía. Esta pieza encajaba a la perfección con el espíritu de la época: exagerado, llamativo y aspiracional. No solo lo usaban integrantes del entorno familiar del riojano, sino también figuras destacadas del espectáculo argentino. En otra de las escenas, Griselda Sicliani lleva otro look muy representativo de los '90. Se trata de un conjunto deportivo y urbano en color celeste. La campera de corte amplio y estilo vintage con cierre hasta el cuello demuestra que en aquellos tiempos la ropa para hacer deportes formaba parte de la vida cotidiana de la sociedad. Por último, este personaje también lleva un traje elegante que supo ser tendencia. El mismo está compuesto por una chaqueta con botones y una falda de raso texturado con acabado tornasolado en tonalidad celeste. Al mismo lo combinó con una camisa blanca por debajo y unos accesorios dorados. De esta manera, Griselda Siciliani no sólo muestra cómo era la relación de Zulema Yoma con Carlos Saúl Menem, sino que también refleja el estilismo propio de la época y destaca las tendencias que se llevaban en 4 looks en particular.

Gran parte de este éxito se debe a la participación de Belinda, quien da vida a Daniela Levy de Mijares, un personaje lleno de matices que ha conquistado al público tanto por su actuación como por su talento vocal. La artista no solo impresionó con su interpretación de clásicos del pop mexicano, sino que cuidó cada detalle de su personaje, seleccionando personalmente un vestuario de firmas como Versace, Chanel y Hermès, que realzó la elegancia de cada escena. El momento más emotivo de la noche fue cuando, tras interpretar el icónico tema frente a su autora original, Amanda Miguel, la legendaria cantante no pudo contener las lágrimas y le dedicó palabras de admiración. “Cantas precioso, lo hiciste muy bien y apenas estás mostrando lo que verdaderamente puedes hacer”. Belinda, visiblemente emocionada, respondió: “Te amamos, te admiramos y eres la mejor”. La banda sonora de Mentiras ha reavivado el gusto por las baladas románticas de los 80. Solo “Él me mintió” sumó más de 1.8 millones de reproducciones en Spotify en una semana, con un aumento del 94% desde el estreno.
