Accessories always make the look But my favourite part? The morning after. Let me set the scene: ♀️ Gua sha to depuff Eye patches for hydration (I've heard great things about the summerfridays Jet Lag ones) Lighting a cozy candle (diptyque, forever) Sipping on a matcha latte while reading something light on my Kindle, wrapped in a silky-soft satin robe Hair?

A cult-favorite Persian Garden fragrance rollerball with warm florals, ocean air, and light amber that reviewers compare to Glossier's $78 ""You."" This is from TikTok-famous small business brand Kuumba Made, known for its luxury scents at ridiculously affordable prices, so you know they're on their game — reviewers especially love how clean and long-lasting this sweet but elevated fragrance feels, and how nicely it plays with other scents! Kuumba Made is a small business that specializes in luxury scents at affordable price points. Promising review: This is my absolute favorite scent. I heard of this from someone I follow on TikTok and figured I would try it out. I fell in love with it the second I put it on. The scent is nice, not super strong, which I like because most perfumes bother my allergies. The scent lasts for a while. One bottle lasts me a few months. I recommend this scent to all my friends. I have tried other scents from this brand, but I think this one is the best. "" —rich allen Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (and check out the rest of Kuumba Made's scents for more options!) . 2. Lumify Eye Drops, a product so beloved by TikTok that despite being more $ than other brands, it's the number one selling brand on Amazon right now. Reviewers swear by this for instant reduction in redness in their eyes, with visible differences within a minute of use. Learn more about different kinds of eye drops and what they can do at Cleveland Clinic. Note that eye drops can potentially mask symptoms of eye conditions, so you should talk to your eye doctor about what's right for you. And according to Mayo Clinic, you should avoid redness-reducing drops if you're looking for dry eye relief. Check out a TikTok of the eye drops in action. Promising review: ""I have a big spot of blood vessels in the inner corner of my left eye. I use the expensive lubricant eye drops for moisture — I've used Visine, Clear Eyes, you name it. No eye drop has made my eyes look this great. Only Lumify! I was soo happy when I looked in the mirror and saw some beauty in my eyes instead of darkness and redness."" —Angela Leonard Get it from Amazon for $11.93. 3. A limited edition (!!) Eos Marshmallow ""Super Balm"" lip treatment from the brand's ""secret menu"" so good that reviewers say it's better than Carmex for healing and better than Summer Fridays for quality. Lip care that also tastes like you're perpetually eating a s'more for less than $5?? My friends, life is good. Check out a TikTok of the marshmallow lip treatment in action. Promising review: ""My new must-have! My number one go-to for healing lips was Carmex. This beat it. I love the consistency (very creamy/smooth), it's not heavily flavored or goopy, and it obviously smells amazing. It isn't overbearing and also doesn't keep coating your mouth like the Eos stick balms (still great, but more wax)."" —Breanah Shirazi Get ti from Amazon for $4.99 (also available in Strawberry Acai). 4. Dr. Melaxin ""Peel Shot,"" a K-beauty staple for serious exfoliation that buffs out dead skin and leaves your complexion looking glowy and refreshed. If you're looking for an effective way to kick dead skin cells, blackheads, and sebum to the curb, this deeply penetrating rice water extract formula is just the ticket. Promising review: ""I bought this after seeing an ad on TikTok. I'm skeptical but I'm a sucker for this kinda stuff, but it is genuinely amazing. I tested it on all the different areas of my body. It didn't do a thing to my well-exfoliated palm, but my face, legs, LIPS… baby soft with big balls of dead skin coming off...."

J'utilise Chat Gpt version gratuite 2.L'article a été rédigé à partir de recherches personnelles, d'observations sur des profils d'influenceurs et d'une réflexion stratégique sur l'authenticité dans le marketing d'influence. J'ai utilisé l'IA de manière ponctuelle pour m'aider à clarifier certaines tournures, et à enrichir certaines transitions. J'ai également demandé à ChatGPT : « Comment structurer un article sur l'évolution du marketing d'influence dans les cosmétiques ? » « Peux-tu me proposer un exemple d'introduction engageante sur les collaborations marques-influenceurs ? » 3. L'article est organisé en trois parties thématiques claires : rôle des influenceurs, authenticité, et valeur stratégique des partenariats. Ce plan a été validé à l'aide d'un échange avec l'IA pour garantir un bon équilibre entre réflexion, exemples et mise en contexte. 4. La rédaction est personnelle, avec une volonté d'illustrer les concepts par des cas concrets (Gisou, Desi Perkins). L'IA m'a permis d'harmoniser le ton et d'ajuster certains mots-clés pour plus de fluidité. 5. Toutes les références mentionnées (marques, influenceurs) ont été vérifiées.

Color Wow's ""Raise The Root"" thickening and lifting spray gives your hair some instant ~~VAVOOM~~, no teasing or heat styling gymnastics required. Promising review: ""Love this product! I have very fine and silky hair and this provides a great root boost to help me style my hair. It is not sticky or stiff and perfectly provides the extra oompf my hair needs!

An exquisite tinted lip balm shockingly similar to Clinique's ""Black Honey"" but it doesn't cost nearly as much. This weightless, non-sticky formula glides onto your pout to give 'em a subtle polished tint of your choosing. Soon you'll be smackin' your lips all over the place, and no one can blame you when they look this good. ♀ My colleague Emma Lord can vouch for this: ""I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference!"" Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a pink honey version, individually, and as a two-pack that includes both!) . 2. Catrice ""Instant Awake"" Under Eye Brightener — it'll help liven up your tired eyes with a lightweight formula that delivers superb coverage in just a few swipes. This tinted concealer contains hyaluronic acid and shea butter that may also help reduce dark circles over time. It's just like the $33 Becca version but for MUCH less. Promising reviews: ""Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it."" —Placeholder ""I ran across this when looking to replace my $33 Becca under-eye brightening cream, and since money is tight, I took a chance. Very surprised to find this product to be comparable in coverage and staying power, and superior in moisture. Highly recommend!"" —Nancy Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades). 3. A TikTok-beloved ""Soft"" perfume rollerball reviewers can't stop raving about, with some even comparing it to lemon pound cake. YUM! This is gonna be a real treat for your senses *and* it rolls on nice and easy. It's basically a budget-friendly version of Pink Sugar, which goes for $65. Promising review: ""It's definitely a [swap] for Pink Sugar, only better. To me, Pink Sugar has changed and now dries down to a too-forward pepper smell that overpowers the sugar. This doesn't do that, it's exactly like Pink Sugar when it first goes on with sweet and powdery scent profiles, and remains that way after dry down...on me, this is what I'm getting anyway. It lasts and lasts too like a quality oil perfume should."" —Criss Get it from Amazon for $4.50. 4. A lash-extending E.l.f. Cosmetics tubing mascara because your lashes deserve the best and you don't wanna waste your time with dry, clumpy (pricey) formulas. This one is perfect for thin, delicate lashes and is similar to Thrive. The lightweight tubing technology wraps around your eyelashes for a smudge-proof lift that looks natural. Plus, it's super easy to take off at the end of the day without tons of harsh scrubbing. Check out a TikTok of the E.l.f. mascara in action...."
mov_9433D0C7388B6DF27BE7BD401114AF99,2025-07-04 03:12:18,en,WEB,"  We took a deep dive into murky online beauty markets to find out what's being sold, how they are being sold, and why so many people are buying them What happens when you live in India with no cousins abroad and a desperate craving for Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip treatment? Or when you're obsessed with the quirky monster doll, Labubu, that everyone on social media seems to own? For some, the answer is simple: don't buy it. But for others - especially those stubborn, brand-loving souls - Indian markets have found a workaround. If you can't get the first copy, just buy the fifth one. And no, these aren't dupes with witty name changes or altered packaging. These are full-blown counterfeits: same branding, identical packaging, but at a mere fraction of the price. We took a deep dive into these murky online markets to find out what's being sold, how they are being sold, and more importantly, why so many people are buying them. But before we unpack all that, let's rewind a bit. The Rise Of India's Counterfeit Culture Counterfeit goods aren't new in India. They've existed in various forms for decades. When globalisation opened the floodgates to international brands, a majority of Indians found themselves unable to afford the real thing. The demand was high, but supply (at least the genuine kind) was out of reach. Naturally, the market responded in its own cheeky way. Think of places like D'manoj Pizza knocking off Domino's. Even when Domino's caught wind of the viral video of their doppelganger, their response was just as cheeky: ""Yahan ka address milega? (Can we get the address?)"" (Not a copyright claim) Today, that spirit has spilled across industries, from fast food to fashion to beauty. Markets like Sarojini Nagar in Delhi, Esplanade in Kolkata and Linking Road in Mumbai are prime examples, brimming with off-brand versions of luxury items. These IRL knock-offs often tweak a letter here, a logo there, or at least get the shade of lipstick slightly off. For beauty products though, the compromises run deeper - especially when it comes to ingredients and safety. But the game has changed online. Unlike the local bazaar, where, you know you're buying a knock-off, e-commerce marketplaces and social media are now peddling products that look identical to the original. Meesho, Facebook Marketplace, Amazon, Instagram... everyone is on it, and everyone is in on it. How These Fake Markets Operate Meesho Meesho is notorious (and simultaneously beloved) for offering bargain-basement prices. The brand claims this is possible because it eliminates middlemen, connects resellers directly to manufacturers, and focuses on lesser-known brands. But this has created the perfect breeding ground for fake products - especially viral beauty items. Take Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip treatment, for instance. Not officially available in India, but somehow being sold on Meesho for less than Rs 500. We even found fake Dior and Gisou lip oils, sold in nearly identical packaging but with slightly altered names. Facebook Marketplace It might not be trending in urban Gen Z circles, but Facebook Marketplace (FMP) is still massive. With over a billion global users shopping every month, it's a hotspot for everything from houseplants to handbags - and now, counterfeit beauty products in India. It's not just about fake luxury either. Some sellers offer bizarrely cheap prices for products that shouldn't even be in India, let alone available at that price. The sheer scale of the platform makes it easy for scamsters to thrive with little scrutiny. Instagram Instagram, Meta's glamorous baby, has become a thriving hub for small business sellers, even in India. Unfortunately, many of them are hawking knock-off makeup and skincare products via Reels. Some don't even bother to change the names-they rely on flashy visuals and discounted prices to hook unsuspecting users. The perfume industry is especially saturated with counterfeit sellers offering half-price on these bottles that may look legit but aren't even close. Insta pages selling perfumes like Dior Sauvage at extremely low price - Beware byu/Pennywise0704 inDesiFragranceAddicts Flipkart And Amazon Even the giants aren't immune to this ailment...."

Meesho, Facebook Marketplace, Instagram, Amazon… सब पर नकली चीजें बिक रही हैं. और सबसे बड़ी बात - लोग खरीद भी रहे हैं. Meesho Meesho पर सस्ते सामान की भरमार है. कंपनी कहती है कि ये सीधे मैन्युफैक्चरर से सामान दिलवाते हैं. पर असल में ये नकली प्रोडक्ट्स का अड्डा बन गया है, खासतौर पर ब्यूटी प्रोडक्ट्स का. Hailey Bieber की Rhode Lip Treatment जो इंडिया में आती ही नहीं, Meesho पर सिर्फ 500 रुपए में मिल रही है. यहां तक कि Dior और Gisou के भी नकली लिप ऑयल्स मिल जाते हैं, बस नाम में हल्का सा फर्क. Facebook Marketplace Facebook Marketplace भी पीछे नहीं है. यहां घर के पौधों से लेकर हैंडबैग्स तक सब बिकता है - अब नकली ब्यूटी प्रोडक्ट्स भी. यहां इतने सस्ते दाम में प्रोडक्ट्स मिलते हैं कि यकीन करना मुश्किल हो जाए. Instagram Instagram भी अब नकली मेकअप बेचने वालों का हॉटस्पॉट बन गया है. यहां Reels के जरिए लोग बिना नाम बदले ही ब्रांड्स की हूबहू कॉपी बेच रहे हैं. खासतौर पर परफ्यूम्स में नकली सामान की भरमार है.

It doesn't get clumpy, it stays put ALL the livelong day no matter how much you sweat, and you can apply it on very lightly if you don't want it to look so dramatic, or continue applying for longer lashes each time. Promising review: ""AWESOME. I've always bought overpriced mascara. I'm very picky and hesitant, but I saw some reviews saying how awesome this was. I'll never go back to 'Better Than Sex' mascara because that's what I always use, and I compare it to that. This is the best mascara!! I'll never go back."" —patrick hauk Price: $10.48 for three (originally $14.97) 4. A pair of waterproof wireless earbuds for 32% off with some real AirPods Pro energy — except these feature a charging case that, bless its technologically savvy heart, has an LED display letting you know exactly how much charge is left. Reviewers also love how delightfully comfortable and sweatproof these are, making them a solid, affordable option for talking on the phone and exercising. Promising review: ""I use these every day at work! Love these — easy to learn and to use. Best thing about them? Well, everything, lol. Good sound, they hold a charge for long periods, and I don't have to worry about them losing power...."

Der Applikator ist aus Plastik und ziemlich unpraktisch – das Produkt verteilt sich dadurch gar nicht gleichmäßig auf den Lippen. Der Geschmack ist auch recht künstlich und das Finish eher schwer und fast farblos. 🤷🏼‍♀️ Ganz anders gisou: Der Applikator ist super angenehm, die Farbe kommt überraschend satt raus und das Öl fühlt sich richtig pflegend an. Für mich in dem Fall ein klarer Punkt für High-End. 🙌🏼💕 Habt ihr schon eines der beiden getestet? Oder habt ihr ein Lieblings-Lippenöl? 😍👇 #Lippenöl #GisouLipOil #CatriceLippenöl #DupeCheck #BeautyVergleich #DrogerieVsHighEnd #BeautyReview #GlossTest #MakeupLover #MakeupReel #SkincareMeetsMakeup #LipglossCheck #BeautyCommunity #RealTalkBeauty #MakeupOnPoint #CatriceCosmetics #GisouGlow #LipOilReview #AffordableVsLuxury"
