mxy349l,2025-06-15 18:08:58,en,REDDIT,"  First off, i want to commend you for getting your life together. I was never homeless but I got pretty close after suffering from bad pill and alcohol addiction. I've been clean and sober for 6 years and once I made the moves and got the support...step by step everything fell into place. I went back to school, started a new amazing career, and started over basically from scratch in a physical, social and emotional sense. So I'd like to encourage you and tell you it's a big step and you can do this! Hold yourself accountable and do all the things daily you need to and stick to routines! You're not wasting a bunch of time being homeless now so you'll explore and find new hobbies...makeup and skin care was one I got real into! Today I have a makeup and skin care collection that many would envy, i built it up over time. One day at a time! Start simple so you don't overwhelm yourself and watch some youtube videos explaining what a skin care routine looks like and what should go together. I printed a ""skin care pyramid"" off google images to help me learn. Start with a toner (for cleansing and prepping the skin for product absorption), then serums, then moisturizer day and night in that order. Vitamin cs serums and moisturizer with spf in the morning (vitamin c helps with discoloration). At night do the break out and anti aging serums ( salicylic acid for break outs, retinol for anti againg) followed by moisturizer but on different days so you don't dry out ur skin too much. Vitamin E serum will help with scars. I reccomend sephoras vitamin C 7%/vitamin E serum to use in the morning followed by whatever moisturizer you like/can afford. Sephora has a lot of options at different price ranges and an easy way to find ingredients with reviews. Shop there! Their sephora skin care brand is great and cheaper than some of the trendy brands out there. For make up, now as you learn and explore keep it simple and easy and inexpensive. Find a tinted moisturizer you like (many have spf now!) And a concealer you like. Tarte has great concealers and the sephora best skin brand has good quality inexpensive concealers. The girls there will help you shade match if you don't know how! You are definetly cool toned or neutral so that should help you pick shades easier (stay away from anything warm toned...it'll make u orange). If you amazon search ""skinny mascara"" you'll see tons of options of mascaras with really thin skinny wands...those will be better for your short and brittle lashes until your lashes grow back fully! I was looking at maybelline one earlier for like $10 and a bunch of Asian brands. Go to tj maxx or Marshall's and buy a full set of makeup brushes. You don't need insane expensive ones while you learn and start. You'll need those for shadows, foundation, concealers etc as you learn and grow. Elf has a lot of inexpensive great products. They give a lot of samples and perks if you shop through their website. You can even buy their skin care products too if you're on a budget. Buy one of their eye shadow pallets and explore and play! I reccomend them and colourpop for lip products. They're quality and you won't feel so upset if you buy a product and realize it's not really for you. I had to go through a lot of lip gloss products before realizing...I'm just a liquid matte lipstick girly to the core and won't use anything semi sticky on my lips! I wish you the best of luck and hugs on your journey girly. You are beauitful and let your beauty shine. Go to tj maxx and Marshall's to explore makeup...they sell high end brands at a discount while you find your system and routine. I don't want to overwhelm you but you'll learn what routine is for you and what make up works for you as time goes on. Don't get overwhelmed and take it one day at a time! You'll see a bunch of you tube videos out there with influencers doing insane full face 30 product routines as if they're going to a daily glam photoshoot. You don't need all those products. If you get into it like that...great! But right now while you're learning all you need is a good foundation or tinted moisturizer,  a concealer for the blemishes and break outs, a mascara and or eye liner, and a lip product you like and a set of brushes! Blushes, contour sticks, bronzers, intricate shadow pallettes, brow gels etc etc aren't a necessity. You can play with all that stuff later as you grow and have more money. Ask family and friends for sephora/ulta gift cards for birthdays and Xmas! (That's what I did!)..."
mxy7d8s,2025-06-15 18:30:50,en,REDDIT,"  Hey, I love this colour on you! It really compliments your skin tone. I could be totally wrong, but I think the colour you're wearing looks slightly more warmer toned? I've got some recommendations for you that I think match the vibe you're looking for and feature a variety of price ranges, shades and finishes to choose from: 1.) ELF Glossy Lip Stain in the shade “Spicy Sienna”. 2.) Rare Beauty Lip Soufflé Matte Lip Cream in the shade “Brave”. 3.) ELF O Face Satin Lipstick in the shade “Vocal”. 4.) REFY Lip Blush in the shade “Cinnamon”. 5.) Lisa Eldridge True Velvet Lip Colour in the shade “Velvet Cinnabar”. 6.) Fenty Icon Velvet Liquid Lipstick in the shade “Fiyahproof”. 7.) Maybelline Super Stay Vinyl Ink Longwear Liquid Lipcolor in the shade “Extra” (this is one of my favourite drugstore formulas!) These shades aren't an exact match to what you're wearing, but I think they fall within the same colour story and general vibe that you're going for. If I think of any more, I'll comment below!"

mov_AA5971C0D9AA6BAA9D7A2840B5D6DB3E,2025-06-16 01:35:32,en,WEB,"  By Abigail Summerville NEW YORK (Reuters) -Activist investor Barington Capital Group plans to mount a push to change Victoria's Secret's board of directors and end a recently adopted shareholder's rights plan, according to a person familiar with the situation. The New York-based hedge fund, which owns more than 1% of the company, believes Victoria's Secret has underperformed its competitors and lost value since its spin-off from former parent company L Brands in 2021, the person said, asking not to be identified because the matter is private. Amid waning demand for its intimate apparel, Victoria's Secret shares have dropped by about 55% this year, and its current market value is about $1.45 billion. The Wall Street Journal reported Barington's plans earlier on Sunday. A Victoria's Secret spokesperson said that Barington has not contacted the company, but it looks forward to ""discussing their views with them."" ""We are confident that executing our strategy under the new and experienced leadership team will continue to unlock value for our shareholders,"" the spokesperson said. Barington wants the company to replace most or all of its board and end the ""poison pill"" plan that it adopted in May to protect it from hostile takeovers. It also believes the retailer should focus on core brands and initiatives, like bras and the Angels campaign, and accelerate growth in digital and international markets, the source said. Barington believes the company's Chief Executive Hillary Super, who took over in September 2024, has limited public company experience, and that the rest of the board lacks the necessary experience to revitalize the iconic brand, the person said. Super was previously the CEO of intimates brand Savage X Fenty. The fund also sees value in the Victoria's Secret beauty business, which it believes could be worth as much as the company's market value. Victoria's Secret adopted the poison pill plan to fend off investment firm BBRC International Private Limited, which increased its stake in the company to around 13%. Barington is also an investor in Macy's and Hanesbrands. Founded by James Mitarotonda, Barington previously pushed for changes at L Brands, which split into Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works. At Macy's, the firm wanted the department store to create a real estate unit and cut costs to boost the share price. Earlier this year, Barington mounted its first full-blown board room challenge since 2015 when it tried to put three directors on the board of casket maker Matthews International but ended up losing the vote.

全部樣本均檢出金屬元素！ 消委會是次測試，重點檢測與安全相關的金屬元素，包括砷、鎘、鉛及水銀。 而結果顯示全部樣本都有少量鉛，含量介乎0.063mg/kg至2.2mg/kg，少過內地規定《化妝品安全技術規範》（2015 年版）的10mg/kg上限，也沒有超出德國聯邦消費者保護及食品安全辦公室（BVL）的5mg/kg建議限值；另外有兩款檢測出砷，也沒有超出相關規定；而鎘及水銀，則完全沒有在任何樣本中檢測到，所以25個樣本沒有太大的安全疑慮。 消委會檢測25款霜狀和液狀眼影
8成檢出可致敏重金屬
雖然樣本檢測出與安全相關的金屬均沒有超過數值，但過敏的成分也不容小覷。 消委會亦檢測了可致敏的金屬元素，包括銻、鉻、鈷及鎳。 發現有8成樣本（20款）檢出鈷，19款檢出鉻，一款樣本檢出0.29mg/kg的銻（符合德國 BVL的建議限值）。 而2003年丹麥一份接觸性皮膚炎評論文章，鎳、鈷和鉻等重金屬均為引致過敏性接觸性皮膚炎的常見原因，這三種金屬不可高於5mg/kg，以次基準來檢測，只有CHANTECAILLE Mermaid Eye Shade的鉻含量（5.4mg/kg）超過水平。 消委會檢測結果顯示，有18款樣本檢出2種可刺激皮膚或可致敏的金屬元素。 3款樣本則完全沒有檢測出可刺激皮膚或可致敏的金屬元素，包括excel Gleam On Fit Shadow、FASIO Multi Face Stick、GIORCIO ARMANI薄紗眼影液。 8成樣本檢出可致敏重金屬！ 乾性膚質留意！ 3款樣本檢出乙醇或酒精成分
此外，除了會過敏的金屬成分需要留意，大家都應留意化妝品上的酒精成分。 消委會發現樣本DECORTÉ Eye Glow Gem Skin SHADOW Matte Eye Color、CANMAKE絲滑眼影液 、ettusais流光閃爍眼影液這三款的成分列表都有乙醇或酒精，對於皮膚幼嫩或者乾性膚質人士不友好，容易對酒精出現過敏反應。 消委會提醒使用以上產品時需特別留意皮膚會不會出現泛紅或乾燥情，若有應立即停用。 7款樣本檢出可污染環境化學品
若想提升眼影的延展性及觸感，廠商會使用環戊矽氧烷（D5）及環己矽氧烷（D6）令眼影均更能均勻塗抹在皮膚上。 但歐洲化學品管理局已將D5和D6列為高度關注物質，因為這兩種化學品有高度持久和生物累積等特性，容易污染環境。 消委會檢測出7款眼影筆和眼影霜樣本含有環矽氧烷化合物，全部檢出D5，當中2款同時檢出D6，有4款檢出D5和D6的樣本標籤所列或其官方網頁所載的成分資料與是次測試結果存有差異。 2027年的歐盟《REACH 條例》將規定駐留類化妝品中D5或D6的濃度不得等於或超過0.1%，若以此來做參考，則檢出相關物質的7款樣本的濃度均高於歐盟條例。 7款樣本檢出可污染環境化學品

The New York-based hedge fund, which owns more than 1% of the company, said Victoria's Secret has underperformed its competitors and lost over $2.4 billion in shareholder value since its spin-off in 2021 from former parent company L Brands.

Victoria's Secret requires a reconstituted board comprising directors with ""proven experience in brand revitalization, operational execution, international expansion, and shareholder value creation,"" James Mitarotonda, Barington's founder and CEO, said in the letter.

Watch: Jennifer Garner Shares Her Feelings About Aging—And Whether She Does Botox Jennifer Garner is saying yes to a new 'do. The actress, 53, recently updated her look by adding fresh blonde highlights to her signature shiny brown hair. Indeed, the star recently revealed the new style in a ""May catch-up” Instagram post, which also included various photos, videos and memes summing up her month. Celebrity hairstylist Tracey Cunningham then shared insight into the entire process behind Jennifer's hair update, which included a side part with long bangs pushed to the right along with the blonde highlights across her head, explaining that the change is for the star's latest role. ""Lightened up this beauty's hair for her latest role—and she's glowing,"" Tracey wrote in a June 15 Instagram post. ""Jennifer's just wrapped (yes, Paris), and is already diving into —a dreamy Nantucket story coming soon to Peacock."" She continued praising Jennifer—who shares Violet, 19, Seraphina, 16, and Samuel, 13 with ex-husband Ben Affleck—adding, ""Actress, producer, mama of three, founder of @onceuponafarm + @virtuelabs… and somehow still the kindest person in the room."" Tracey also shared a video with how exactly she colored Jennifer's hair, detailing the exact formula she used of Schwarzkopf Professional USA's BLONDEME lightener, creating what she called in the video a ""Ready for Summer Blonde."" The Beverly Hills hairstylist's comment section was filled with compliments, including from 's Jennifer Grey who commented ""Perfect"" and actress Rita Wilson who commented ""Gorgeousness!"" While Jennifer did undergo the transformation for her upcoming role, she recently spoke out about how she hasn't focused too much on her appearance throughout her career. “Part of the gift of being my mother's daughter is that I haven't spent a lot of time stressing about my physical appearance,” she told in an interview published June 6. “I don't spend a lot of time in the mirror. Sometimes I could spend more time in the mirror; I'm sure I've had things in my teeth or a bump in my hair. So there are pluses and minuses to it.” And although she noted, ""I don't judge whatever makes anyone look or feel their best,"" she shared that rather than pursuing appearance-altering measures, she's focused on remaining grateful to be able to live her best life at 53 years old. ""I don't want to be younger,"" she explained. ""I'm very grateful to be exactly this age. I'm trying to soak it up. I feel like I'm living in my power. I'm living in my wisdom. I'm living in my joy and my capacity to do and get things done. So I'm just very aware of my luck and the grace that's been shown to me."" For more celebrity hair transformations, read on.

Nikkie Tutorials aka Nikkie de Jager; Plastique Tiara; Jools Lebron footage stills via YouTube ; ; (L-R) Nikkie Tutorials a.k.a. Nikkie de Jager; Plastique Tiara; Jools Lebron The beauty community online has a storied history in digital culture. The first few influencers who started creating beauty-related content were makeup artists who shared tips, tricks, and tutorials. That first wave of creators in the beauty industry included Michelle Phan (credited as one of the first beauty influencers by Business Insider), Jackie Aina, Lauren Luke, and Marlena Stell. Not only did this community grow over the years, but it also attracted millions of viewers interested in different types of creators. In 2016, the world was introduced to one of the most notorious queer influencers on YouTube: James Charles. He quickly became one of the most famous male beauty influencers, and was recognized as the poster child for the evolving beauty community as more LGBTQ+ influencers gained visibility within it. Increasingly, queer influencers have become integral to this online space, emerging as some of the most followed creators on YouTube — and now also on Instagram and TikTok. In honor of Pride Month, it's the perfect time to highlight the top 10 most followed LGBTQ+ content creators across YouTube, TikTok, and Instagram. 10. Jools Lebron #fyp #demure TikTok: 2.3 million followers Instagram: 210,000 followers Overall audience for Jools Lebron: 2.51 million fans Jools Lebron is a trans woman from Puerto Rico who coined the phrase ""very demure"" in 2024. Her first video using the term has garnered over 56 million views over the years, and she's continued to grow her platform ever since. Following the success of that viral catchphrase, Lebron revealed that she was finally able to afford gender-affirming surgery. Going into 2025, Lebron continues to capitalize on her success, keeps growing her brand, and is posting even more on social media. 9. Mei Pang More in Celebrity INVERTED MAKEUP - the results if it worked or not is at the very end! #halloweenmakeup #invertedmakeup #avantgardemakeup TikTok: 4.1 million followers Instagram: 3.4 million followers YouTube: (mostly inactive) Overall audience for Mei Pang: 7.5 million fans Mei Pang got her start on YouTube in 2018 and immediately stood out for her elaborate, avant-garde makeup looks. Over time, Pang secured millions of followers across Instagram and TikTok. As she ascended to mainstream notoriety, she caught the attention of high-profile celebrities like Gaultier (who collaborated with her) and Rihanna (who asked her to walk in a Savage x Fenty fashion show). 8. Trixie Mattel [embedded content] - YouTube Instagram: 4.2 million followers TikTok: 2.5 million followers YouTube: 2.3 million subscribers Overall audience for Trixie Mattel: 9 million fans At this point, whether or not you've seen RuPaul's Drag Race — including her journey to win All Stars 3 — there's a good chance you're familiar with Trixie Mattel from her huge presence on social networks. Trixie has branched out over the years to build her own multimedia empire. In addition to her podcasts, live performances, makeup company, and even an establishment like the Trixie Motel in Palm Springs, the Drag Race superstar and Out100 honoree has gained millions of followers on TikTok and YouTube, the latter of which is where she films tutorials and collabs with influencers — often putting them into drag (wig and all!) . 7.

mov_0DD49B463711AF16B12268FBFA02E02E,2025-06-17 10:17:35,en,WEB,"  Growing up in a small town in New Hampshire, Nora Princiotti lived two hours away from the nearest mall, so the Scholastic Book Fair was her lifeline to pop culture purchases. In fall 2003, the then-9-year-old made a beeline to the fair and bought gum, glitter gel pens and ""Metamorphosis,"" the second studio album from ""Lizzie McGuire"" star Hilary Duff. At that time, Duff was ""the single most important person in the world to me outside my immediate family,"" Princiotti writes in ""Hit Girls: Britney, Taylor, Beyoncé, and the Women Who Built Pop's Shiniest Decade."" ""This is the first day of the rest of my life."" This proclamation is no exaggeration. Duff's CD was Princiotti's gateway to the vibrant pop music universe of the 2000s - an era that ""Hit Girls"" thoroughly examines through the lens of some of the decade's music icons. The chronological book opens with Britney Spears reigniting industry interest in mainstream pop after the roaring success of her snappy debut single, 1998's ""...Baby One More Time."" Princiotti subsequently devotes chapters to Rihanna's world-shifting dance music and savvy use of technology; the scrappy (and occasionally bumpy) pop-punk odyssey of Avril Lavigne; and the complicated relationship between indie rock and pop, exemplified by ""American Idol"" sweetheart Kelly Clarkson. She also reexamines with a much kinder eye the music of Ashlee Simpson, whose career cratered after she was caught lip-syncing on ""Saturday Night Live,"" and then-tabloid fixtures Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton. Princiotti, a staff writer at the Ringer who covers pop music and the NFL and co-hosts the podcast ""Every Single Album,"" says she was certain which artists needed to be included in ""Hit Girls."" ""I had the idea a little bit before the Y2K resurgence that we've experienced over the last few years,"" she says. ""But it was trickling into the ecosystem. And I had this very clear idea that there are all these disparate segments of the pop star world and the version of that world that existed in the 2000s. ... Even though that music is different, it all fit together to me really obviously, because I was the fan."" Princiotti augments her rigorous research with colorful memories from this era, including chatting on AIM (her handle was mangorainbow99), digging up Taylor Swift rarities on YouTube and hearing Lady Gaga's ""Just Dance"" at a high school dance. Finding a cohesive story of the 2000s was more challenging. ""The question that I had to answer [in the book] was, 'Other than the audience - and other than having this feeling inside me that a book that covered the rise of Britney Spears also needed to cover 'Rumors' by Lindsay Lohan and also needed to cover Ashlee Simpson, because that's how I lived it - what actually ties these artists together?'"" That uniting thread is Spears. The book deftly traces the parallels between the evolution of Spears' career and how the decade itself unfolded - from the way her music broadened beyond teen pop (e.g. the electro-disco ""Toxic"") to the negative impact the intense tabloid scrutiny had on her mental health. ""She is the artist of the 2000s,"" Princiotti says. ""If you think of the aughts as a whole, it starts with Britney, [and] she manages to keep it going. There's so many things that I think just come back to that one woman."" Princiotti also concludes that the female pop stars of the 2000s helped legitimize pop music. ""There's something about what all of these women - because it is women in the book - did to chip away at the idea that pop is disposable and unserious music, that somehow got us to this place where it is more often recognized as a serious art form, something that moves culture [and] is worthy of real, deep criticism,"" she says. ""You're seeing every day where there are thesis-driven projects about Taylor Swift and the music of Taylor Swift, and [people asking,] 'What does she mean to society?' and 'What does she mean to culture? The thing that struck me was, 'Oh, we didn't have that. It wasn't like that - and now it is.'"" Given the book's narrow time frame - ""Hit Girls"" starts just before Y2K and ends in the early 2010s - the book also takes a different spin on the careers of Swift and fellow superstar Beyoncé. The latter was newly emerging as a solo artist with 2003's ""Dangerously in Love"" after breaking through with Destiny's Child. Princiotti argues that Beyoncé's success on the pop charts opened doors for hip-hop and R&B artists, which had a seismic impact on culture as a whole. Although these genres had started making massive inroads into the pop charts and mainstream music starting in the late 1990s, Princiotti observed in her research that magazine and tabloid covers still largely prioritized white artists. ""While there was a clear relationship between the interest in an artist like Britney Spears's life and the interest in her music, that feedback loop did not exist for a lot of Black artists,"" she writes. ""Which meant that hip-hop could dominate popular music while being shut out of the elite celebrity spaces that promote true pop stardom."" Swift, meanwhile, was an earnest country-pop wunderkind building her fan base one MySpace comment at a time - and even then happened to be a genius at understanding the psychology of fandom and the online habits of her followers. ""I came away with an appreciation of just how early in her career she laid the blueprint of how she would develop her fan base,"" Princiotti says. ""When it's all said and done, we will look back at her artistic legacy, yes, as the songwriter of a generation, yes, as the poet laureate of young women."" ""But I do think that the legacy of Taylor Swift is going to start with the communities of people that she brought together within her fan base - and how powerful and sometimes scary and how mobilized that fan community has become, and how she built it to be that way."" As with Swift, many of the artists in ""Hit Girls"" remain popular today. Lavigne and Beyoncé are currently on major tours; Clarkson has found success with her daytime talk show; Rihanna is a billionaire business mogul thanks to her brands Fenty Beauty and Savage X Fenty. And Duff, who now has four kids, starred in the TV show ""Younger"" and, most recently, the short-lived ""How I Met Your Father."" Near the end of ""Hit Girls,"" Princiotti explores the ongoing influence of these artists and this decade - from the current crop of young pop stars led by Olivia Rodrigo and nostalgia festivals like When We Were Young to fashion trends such as dark denim, ""going-out"" tops and butterfly hair clips. Princiotti herself maintains a love of pop stars and offers solid theories about why this specific era remains such a fascination: a heady mix of nostalgia, second chances and perspective. ""For people like me who lived through at least some of it, it's the ability to go back a little bit older and wiser,"" she says. ""We can take the best of it and then reexamine the worst of it with more open eyes. And there's something to me that's very satisfying about that.""

经历了数年的创业热潮，市场开始对名人出资的企业“退烧”。 但美国电影、电视和流行音乐行业的顶尖女明星们仍有大把钞票入账，令人称羡。 在商界，时机就是一切——即使对富豪名流也不例外。 2020年底是名人创业的黄金期，个个势如破竹，那些最善于抓住机会的流行歌手、演员和脱口秀主持人，以自己的名字作为金字招牌打造各类企业（包括美妆品牌和影视制作公司等），创造了数亿财富，个别人的斩获甚至达到十亿美元级别。 但如今，和许多人一样，他们也感受到了经济降温的影响。 在今年《福布斯》美国最富有白手起家女性榜单上，有16位名人跻身由企业家、高管和艺人组成的百强名单。 想要上榜，候选人的身家至少需达到3.5亿美元——这一标准高于去年的3亿美元和2023年的2.25亿美元。 这些活跃在舞台和银幕上的女明星们的财富总额高达141亿美元，高于去年的133亿美元——主要得益于新上榜的女演员赛琳娜·戈麦斯（Selena Gomez，第48位），她虽尚未成为亿万富豪，但其约7亿美元的身家几乎贡献了全部增量。 其余15位明星的财富则大多与一年前基本持平。 2020年9月，正值名人创业潮初兴之际，戈麦斯创办了个人美妆品牌Rare Beauty。 到2023年，该公司公开的营收已达3.67亿美元。 无独有偶，电视仲裁节目主持人朱迪·辛德林（Judy Sheindlin，第61位）于2020年末签署了一份巨额协议，将其同名节目移至亚马逊（Amazon）Prime平台；流行歌星蕾哈娜（Rihanna，第35位）则在2021年初为其内衣品牌Savage x Fenty融资，公司估值达到10亿美元；同年夏天，麦当娜（Madonna，第42位）与华纳音乐（Warner Music）签署了利润丰厚的新合约；或许最引人注目的是，2021年8月，影星瑞茜·威瑟斯彭（Reese Witherspoon，第82位）卖掉了旗下制作公司Hello Sunshine的多数股权，据称交易估值高达9亿美元。 如今在好莱坞，Hello Sunshine 这桩收购案常被视为名人影视项目泡沫的顶峰。 Candle Media在黑石集团（Blackstone）支持下对其进行收购时， Hello Sunshine曾预测2023年自身利润将达到8000万美元。 但彭博社（Bloomberg）2023年10月的一份报告显示，其当年利润不足1000万美元，且此后两年间新项目的推进速度仍持续放缓。 截至2025年，《福布斯》估算Hello Sunshine的价值已不足其售价的三分之一。 （威瑟斯彭的代表对此估值提出异议，但未提供具体说明。） 美妆市场也同样遇冷——这一行业成就了榜单上的多位女性，包括戈麦斯、蕾哈娜、卡戴珊及其同母异父的妹妹凯莉·詹纳（Kylie Jenner，第52位）。 《福布斯》估算，受美妆品牌Fenty Beauty和内衣品牌Savage X Fenty销售表现平平的影响，过去一年蕾哈娜身家减少了近30%。 晨星（Morningstar）分析师苏丹（Dan Su，音译）在5月初接受《福布斯》采访时指出：“当前化妆品行业的市场环境正在对估值形成某种下行压力。” 音乐版权市场同样疲软。 2023年，凯蒂·佩里（Katy Perry，第97位）出售了其母带版权与词曲版权的权益，交易金额估计为2.25亿美元。 但行业分析师向《福布斯》指出，若当下有类似艺人想进行相同交易，其估值可能面临20%至30%的折让。 佩里将于今夏重启巡演，碧昂丝·诺尔斯-卡特（第45位）亦然——后者在2023年爆火的“文艺复兴”（Renaissance）巡演期间身家实现大幅跃升，但在“牛仔卡特”（Cowboy Carter）巡演初期，已见票价走低、销售走弱之势。 在如此颓势中，泰勒·斯威夫特（Taylor Swift ，第21位）一枝独秀。 据《福布斯》估算，过去一年其财富增长3亿美元，达到16亿美元。 她标志性的“时代巡演”（Eras Tour）于2023年启动，2024年12月收官，创下20亿美元的票房记录，创收方式除门票销售外还包括一部爆火的电影，以及巡演相关书籍。 这一现象级成功使她杀出重围，免于像其他名人那样受行业趋势影响。 以下是登上2025年《福布斯》美国最富有白手起家女性榜单的名人：

 经历了数年的创业热潮，市场开始对名人出资的企业“退烧”。 但美国电影、电视和流行音乐行业的顶尖女明星们仍有大把钞票入账，令人称羡。 在商界，时机就是一切——即使对富豪名流也不例外。 2020年底是名人创业的黄金期，个个势如破竹，那些最善于抓住机会的流行歌手、演员和脱口秀主持人，以自己的名字作为金字招牌打造各类企业（包括美妆品牌和影视制作公司等），创造了数亿财富，个别人的斩获甚至达到十亿美元级别。 但如今，和许多人一样，他们也感受到了经济降温的影响。 在今年《福布斯》美国最富有白手起家女性榜单上，有16位名人跻身由企业家、高管和艺人组成的百强名单。 想要上榜，候选人的身家至少需达到3.5亿美元——这一标准高于去年的3亿美元和2023年的2.25亿美元。 这些活跃在舞台和银幕上的女明星们的财富总额高达141亿美元，高于去年的133亿美元——主要得益于新上榜的女演员赛琳娜·戈麦斯（Selena Gomez，第48位），她虽尚未成为亿万富豪，但其约7亿美元的身家几乎贡献了全部增量。 其余15位明星的财富则大多与一年前基本持平。 2020年9月，正值名人创业潮初兴之际，戈麦斯创办了个人美妆品牌Rare Beauty。 到2023年，该公司公开的营收已达3.67亿美元。 无独有偶，电视仲裁节目主持人朱迪·辛德林（Judy Sheindlin，第61位）于2020年末签署了一份巨额协议，将其同名节目移至亚马逊（Amazon）Prime平台；流行歌星蕾哈娜（Rihanna，第35位）则在2021年初为其内衣品牌Savage x Fenty融资，公司估值达到10亿美元；同年夏天，麦当娜（Madonna，第42位）与华纳音乐（Warner Music）签署了利润丰厚的新合约；或许最引人注目的是，2021年8月，影星瑞茜·威瑟斯彭（Reese Witherspoon，第82位）卖掉了旗下制作公司Hello Sunshine的多数股权，据称交易估值高达9亿美元。 如今在好莱坞，Hello Sunshine 这桩收购案常被视为名人影视项目泡沫的顶峰。 Candle Media在黑石集团（Blackstone）支持下对其进行收购时， Hello Sunshine曾预测2023年自身利润将达到8000万美元。 但彭博社（Bloomberg）2023年10月的一份报告显示，其当年利润不足1000万美元，且此后两年间新项目的推进速度仍持续放缓。 截至2025年，《福布斯》估算Hello Sunshine的价值已不足其售价的三分之一。 （威瑟斯彭的代表对此估值提出异议，但未提供具体说明。） 美妆市场也同样遇冷——这一行业成就了榜单上的多位女性，包括戈麦斯、蕾哈娜、卡戴珊及其同母异父的妹妹凯莉·詹纳（Kylie Jenner，第52位）。 《福布斯》估算，受美妆品牌Fenty Beauty和内衣品牌Savage X Fenty销售表现平平的影响，过去一年蕾哈娜身家减少了近30%。 晨星（Morningstar）分析师苏丹（Dan Su，音译）在5月初接受《福布斯》采访时指出：“当前化妆品行业的市场环境正在对估值形成某种下行压力。” 音乐版权市场同样疲软。 2023年，凯蒂·佩里（Katy Perry，第97位）出售了其母带版权与词曲版权的权益，交易金额估计为2.25亿美元。 但行业分析师向《福布斯》指出，若当下有类似艺人想进行相同交易，其估值可能面临20%至30%的折让。 佩里将于今夏重启巡演，碧昂丝·诺尔斯-卡特（第45位）亦然——后者在2023年爆火的“文艺复兴”（Renaissance）巡演期间身家实现大幅跃升，但在“牛仔卡特”（Cowboy Carter）巡演初期，已见票价走低、销售走弱之势。 在如此颓势中，泰勒·斯威夫特（Taylor Swift ，第21位）一枝独秀。 据《福布斯》估算，过去一年其财富增长3亿美元，达到16亿美元。 她标志性的“时代巡演”（Eras Tour）于2023年启动，2024年12月收官，创下20亿美元的票房记录，创收方式除门票销售外还包括一部爆火的电影，以及巡演相关书籍。 这一现象级成功使她杀出重围，免于像其他名人那样受行业趋势影响。 以下是登上2025年《福布斯》美国最富有白手起家女性榜单的名人：身家数据统计截至2025年5月2日奥普拉·温弗瑞（Oprah Winfrey）身家：31亿美元财富来源：电视节目年龄：71岁较2024年上榜时身家变化（以下简称变化）：+3%尽管其冠名脱口秀停播已近十五年，温弗瑞依然活跃在荧幕前——她出演了Netflix电影《6888女子营》（The Six Triple Eight），并在过去一年主持了三档电视特辑。 据报道，她还于去年豪掷7500万美元，购入一架新私人飞机，并在夏威夷持有大量豪宅。 其曾参与投资的WeightWatchers（她于2024年5月退出董事会）于今年5月申请破产。 图片来源：TOM WILLIAMS/GETTY-IMAGES金·卡戴珊（Kim Kardashian）身家：17亿美元财富来源：塑形衣、美妆护肤年龄：44岁变化：持平今年2月，卡戴珊年销售额近9亿美元的塑身衣品牌Skims与运动鞋服巨头耐克（Nike）推出联名品牌NikeSkims，系列产品预计将在未来数月内上市。 3月，美妆集团科蒂（Coty）剥离了其持有的卡戴珊护肤品牌SKKN by Kim的20%股权，此次剥离导致公司录得7100万美元的亏损。 图片来源：TAYLOR HILL/GETTY IMAGES泰勒·斯威夫特（Taylor Swift）身家：16亿美元财富来源：音乐年龄：35岁变化：+23%图片来源：EMMA MCINTYRE/TAS24历经54座城市149场演出后，她的“时代”巡演于去年12月收官，成为音乐史上最成功的巡演——仅票房收入就突破20亿美元，是此前纪录的两倍。 除演唱会门票外，这位全球巨星还发掘了多种方式将死忠粉的热情转化为真金白银，其中就包括电影、书籍以及专辑重录。 过去两年间，这些项目总计为她带来逾2亿美元的收入。 5月下旬，她从私募股权公司Shamrock Capital手中购回了前六张专辑的母带版权，首次实现了对自己全部音乐作品的完全掌控。 她在官网发布的一封信中写道：“我最大的梦想成真了。” 蕾哈娜（Rihanna）身家：10亿美元财富来源：音乐、美妆年龄：37岁变化：-29%这位流行天后的主要业务板块接连受挫，财富缩水4亿美元。 2024年8月，其内衣品牌Savage X Fenty的CEO离职转投维多利亚的秘密。 与LVMH集团合资的Fenty Beauty美妆线销售额增长乏力，LVMH直言“市场环境严峻”。 不过在5月Met Gala时尚盛典上，蕾哈娜宣布怀上第三胎的喜讯。 麦当娜（Madonna）身家：8.5亿美元财富来源：音乐年龄：66岁变化：持平出道40余年的她仍在创造传奇。 去年12月她在社交媒体透露正在筹备新专辑，并喊话：“2025年了，谁想听新歌！” 此前其“庆典”（Celebration）巡回演唱会于5月收官，斩获2.3亿美元票房，这是她自2001年以来第六次巡演票房破亿。 碧昂丝·诺尔斯-卡特（Beyoncé Knowles-Carter）身家：7.8亿美元财富来源：音乐年龄：43岁变化：+4%4月底，这位流行天后正式启动“牛仔卡特”巡回演唱会，今夏将在欧美九座城市举办32场体育场级演出。 去年她与拉斯维加斯Sphere场馆的驻场演出谈判破裂，今年春季双方矛盾升级——碧昂丝在巡演前几站播放了一段CGI特效视频，画面中她“捧起”了Sphere，引发场馆老板詹姆斯·多兰（James Dolan）发出律师函，要求她停止侵权。 赛琳娜·戈麦斯（Selena Gomez）身家：7亿美元财富来源：美妆年龄：32岁变化：新上榜图片来源：LIONEL HAHN/GETTY IMAGES五年前，戈麦斯创立了以个人第三张录音室专辑命名的美妆品牌Rare Beauty。 该品牌凭借明星产品液体腮红走红，通过官网和丝芙兰渠道销售，去年营收约3.7亿美元。 据《福布斯》评估，该品牌估值达13亿美元，她持有至少51%股份。..."

明星美妆品牌，怎么就开始席卷欧美市场了？ 今年五月底，海莉·比伯（Hailey Bieber）的彩妆及护肤品牌Rhode以10亿美元的价格出售给了e.l.f. beauty，成为近年来规模最大的名人美妆收购案。 这也让这位28岁的美国模特进入了华尔街的视野。 Rhode成立仅三周年，却数次成为欧美社交媒体上的时尚风向标，这不仅是因为创始人Hailey的明星身份，更是说明了欧美年轻一代消费者的审美和价值追求。 事实上，当下欧美彩妆市场正经历着深刻变革。 从行业数据来看，2025 年第一季度，美国大众美妆销售额同比增长 3%，大众渠道增速首次赶超高端线——消费者偏好正悄然转变。 与此同时，像Rhode这类由顶流明星打造的品牌遍地开花，蕾哈娜（Rihanna）的Fenty Beauty、赛琳娜・戈麦斯（Selena Gomez）的Rare Beauty等，都成功打造了风靡欧美的爆款产品。 但繁华背后亦有隐忧，不少明星美妆品牌在短暂辉煌后迅速“塌房”。 在这波明星品牌崛起与陨落交织的浪潮里，隐藏着怎样的商业逻辑？ 它们是营销噱头的昙花一现，还是真有契合市场的独到之处？ 本期节目，《硅谷101》有幸邀请到某国货彩妆品牌出海负责人宫一柳和前券商可选消费首席分析师、“远行者与碎冰匠”频道主理人Neko（江东猫草）。 《硅谷101》特约研究员Yiwen将与她们一同深度剖析欧美明星品牌背后的商业逻辑。 欢迎关注《硅谷101视频号》的音频栏目直接收听本期播客 。 如 果你喜欢我们的 节目，更推荐大家使用音频客户端来收听，《硅谷101 》已覆盖各大主流音频平台（渠道见文末），欢迎订阅！ 以下是这次对话内容的精选: 
01 
不同于护肤，彩妆复杂的SKU管理 
Yiwen：大家觉得彩妆品牌的SKU管理，为什么这么难？ Neko：从分析师角度看，彩妆行业非常反直觉。 尽管它天然与价值观、包容度相关，但SKU管理难度极大，二级市场普遍认为其难以预测。 我们原本认为底妆因色号与质地相对单一（如3-4个色号✖️2种质地），SKU管理应较简单，但Fenty基于人种与肤色包容度推出海量色号，将底妆复杂度提升至接近普通彩妆的水平。 国内市场似乎缺乏与之完全对应的品牌。 若从明星品牌角度勉强类比，或许只有范冰冰自创品牌Fan Beauty，但它主攻面膜与护肤，非以彩妆为主。 国内以个人IP创业的彩妆品牌，较常被提及的有已上市的毛戈平，以及珀莱雅投资并控股的唐毅品牌彩棠。 来源：pixabay 
国内市场的风险偏好整体低于美国分析师或从业者。 品牌倾向于控制色彩、色号数量及SKU总量，使得库存周转长期维持在相对稳健的位置上。 彩妆品类长期盈利困难，包括资生堂在内的许多品牌均承认色彩类产品不赚钱。 因此，二级市场在评估彩妆品类时，对一级市场品牌兴衰的红利期心存疑虑，更期待品牌上市后能长期保持稳健与可预期性。 尤其在国内，二级市场机构投资者倾向于“先学挨打再学打人”，希望品牌控制风险，做到SKU可控：哪怕有50个色号，也至少需要明确告知重点生产的是哪些色号，其余则视为品牌建设的成本。 Yiwen：Rare Beauty曾在疫情期间推出过48色粉底，甚至为此找了48位不同肤色的素人进行测试，说明对于欧美彩妆品牌而言，色彩丰富度可能是一个相当重要的目标。 宫一柳：一个常见误区是将彩妆（Cosmetics）与护肤（Skincare）混为一谈，统称“美妆”。 但它们的底层逻辑截然不同：彩妆极度偏向时尚，以多SKU、多上新、多进度变化为特点，对库存管理和时尚敏感度的要求极高；对消费者而言，属于低客单价、低决策门槛、低复购率的品类，消费驱动力多为冲动购物与时尚跟风。 而底妆类产品（如粉底液）则更接近护肤，具有高复购、长周期的特点，部分护肤品的单一SKU甚至能维持十年的生命周期。 因此，彩妆行业极度关注当下流行元素、色系，并常有季节性设计。 既然底妆的色号管理本就麻烦，为什么现在的欧美彩妆品牌普遍强调多色号？ 部分因为Fenty Beauty开创了肤色包容度的新认知，契合了欧美社会对包容度（Inclusivity，或称DEI）的高度强调，Z世代消费者将包容度视为品牌文化认同的标尺。 以卡戴珊的SKIMS为例，它是极具研究价值的明星服饰品牌。 除了创始人卡戴珊塑造的“曲线”（Curvy）审美外，其能火的关键还在于尺码的极致包容。 同一件衣服能提供从XXS到XXL的广泛尺码，让几乎所有体型的人都能找到合适的、甚至让身材变得像卡戴珊一样好看的尺码。 这是一种强烈的包容度表达，也正是欧美泛年轻群体非常需要的价值主张。 02 
Z世代买单的不只产品，更是价值观
Yiwen：赛琳娜的Rare Beauty具体如何讲述价值观故事？ 因为彩妆最终卖的还是产品，但它在营销上花了很多心思，去打造“重视身心健康”的理念。 宫一柳：我认为Rare Beauty是从多方面持续传递和表达这一理念。 “品牌”的核心不在于一次线上活动或明星代言，而在于持之以恒地、用高质量内容重复表达同一主题。 这种“重复”和“高质量”至关重要，同时“一致性”也很关键。 Rare Beauty官网写道，它致力于用社会影响力改变世界 
来源：Rare Beauty 
比如，赛琳娜是一个很早就进入好莱坞，并且从十几岁到三十多岁一直在好莱坞工作的童星。 对于一个影响力如此大的名人来说，她从自有品牌创立的第一天起，就以非常坦诚的态度，和所有观众分享她在最脆弱的时刻和严重疾病斗争的经验——她曾患有红斑狼疮、肾病，也多次与双向情感障碍抗争。 这些故事对美国乃至全球流行文化受众都具有代表性和感染力。 而且我们要关注到，这一品牌推出时间基本上是在疫情期间——当时大家的心理状态更加脆弱，更加希望能够在线上有各种情感上的互相支持。 这也是欧美近年来的一个主流趋势，明星们愿意揭开脆弱面——不是随时随地都光鲜亮丽，而是有很多挣扎时刻，并希望通过分享这些经历来激励他人。 Rare Beauty从一开始传递的就不是“用彩妆变美”，而是关爱自身健康、分享爱、拥有更多能量，从而身心更加健康、由内而外散发光芒。 这种理念从第一天起就植入品牌表达，比如它体现在产品色号命名上，如Hope（希望）、Joy（快乐）——这种积极正向、一听就让人开心的名字，而不是根据颜色的传统命名方式。 赛琳娜本人对品牌非常投入，花了大量时间精力真正与用户沟通交流，这些活动更多是社区链接而非单纯卖货。..."

2025 年榜單中，女星總資產累計達 141 億美元，高於去年 133 億。 其中最大推力來自首次上榜的賽琳娜 · 戈梅茲（Selena Gomez），以 7 億美元資產躍居第 48 名，幾乎貢獻全部增幅。 ‌
16 位上榜女星資產亮眼，詳情一覽
1. 歐普拉 · 溫芙蕾 （Oprah Winfrey）：榜上第 13 名，資產 31 億美元，較 2024 年上榜時增長 3%
儘管其冠名脫口秀停播已近十五年，歐普拉依然活躍在螢幕前，她不但出演了 Netflix 電影，還在過去一年主持了三檔電視特輯。 據報導，她還於去年豪擲 7500 萬美元，購入一架新私人飛機，並在夏威夷持有大量豪宅。 曾參與投資的 WeightWatchers（她於 2024 年 5 月退出董事會）於今年 5 月申請破產。 2. 金 · 卡戴珊 （Kim Kardashian）：榜上第 19 名，資產 17 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時持平
今年 2 月，卡戴珊年銷售額近 9 億美元的塑身衣品牌 Skims 與運動鞋服巨頭 Nike(NKE-US) 推出聯名品牌 NikeSkims，系列產品預計在未來幾個月內上市。 3 月，美妝集團科蒂 (COTY-US) 剝離了其持有的卡戴珊護膚品牌 SKKN by Kim 的 20% 股權，此次剝離導致公司錄得 7100 萬美元的虧損。 3. 泰勒絲（Taylor Swift）：榜上第 21 名，資產 16 億美元，較 2024 年上榜時增長 23%
經過 54 座城市 149 場演出後，泰勒絲的「時代」巡演於去年 12 月結束，成為音樂史上最成功的巡迴演出，光是票房收入就突破 20 億美元，是先前紀錄的兩倍。 除演唱會門票外，這位全球巨星還發掘了多種方式將死忠粉的熱情轉化為真金白銀，其中就包括電影、書籍以及專輯重錄。 過去兩年間，這些項目總計為她帶來逾 2 億美元的收入。 5 月下旬，她從私募股權公司 Shamrock Capital 手中購回了前六張專輯的母帶版權，首次實現了對自己全部音樂作品的完全掌控。 4. 蕾哈娜（Rihanna）：榜上第 35 名，資產 10 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比減少 29%
流行天后蕾哈娜的主要業務部門接連受挫，財富縮水 4 億美元。 2024 年 8 月，其內衣品牌 Savage X Fenty 的 CEO 離職轉投維多利亞的秘密。 與 LVMH 集團合資的 Fenty Beauty 美妝線銷售成長乏力，LVMH 直言「市場環境嚴峻」。 5. 瑪丹娜（Madonna）：榜上第 42 名，資產 8.5 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比持平
出道 40 餘年的蕾哈娜仍在創造傳奇。 去年 12 月她在社群媒體透露正在籌備新專輯，並喊話：「2025 年了，誰想聽新歌！」 此前其 Celebration 巡迴演唱會於 5 月收官，斬獲 2.3 億美元票房，這是她自 2001 年以來第六次巡演票房破億。 6. 碧昂絲（Beyoncé）：榜上第 45 名，資產 7.8 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比增加 4%
4 月底，流行天后碧昂絲正式啟動「牛仔卡特」巡迴演唱會，今夏將在歐美九座城市舉辦 32 場體育場級演出。 7. 席琳娜 · 戈梅茲 （Selena Gomez）：榜上第 48 名，資產 7 億美元，新上榜
五年前，戈梅茲創立了以個人第三張錄音室專輯命名的美妝品牌 Rare Beauty。 該品牌以明星產品液體腮紅走紅，透過官網和絲芙蘭通路銷售，去年營收約 3.7 億美元。 根據《富比士》評估，該品牌估值達 13 億美元，戈梅茲持有至少 51% 股份。 這位迪士尼頻道出身的明星如今在熱門影集《破案三人行》（Only Murders in the Building）中身兼主演與聯合製片人，單集片酬達 60 萬美元（目前已播出 40 集）。 去年 12 月，她以電影《璀璨女人夢》（Emilia Pérez）獲得金球獎最佳女配角提名。 今年 3 月，她與音樂製作人未婚夫班尼 · 布蘭柯（Benny Blanco）聯合推出了新專輯。 8. 凱莉．詹娜（Kylie Jenner）：榜上第 52 名，資產 6.7 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比減少 6%。 儘管科蒂集團已出售其同母異父姐姐金卡戴珊護膚品牌的股份，但對 Kylie Cosmetics 的表現頗為滿意，特別肯定了其在印度、新加坡等新興市場的成功擴張。 凱莉新推出的 Cosmic 香水系列似乎也拉動了銷售成長。 雖然這成為科蒂財報的亮點，但美容類股票估值普遍走低，該集團股價自去年以來已暴跌 50%。 凱莉去年還跨界推出了罐裝伏特加軟飲 Sprinter。 9. 茱蒂 · 夏德林（Judy Sheindlin）：榜上第 61 名，資產 5.8 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比增加 4％。 今年 1 月，這位以「朱迪法官」之稱而為人所知的電視仲裁專家夏德林與亞馬遜續簽合約，其製作的《Judy Justice》節目仍保持每年 120 集的高產量，不僅在串流媒體平台播出，還透過聯合發行模式覆蓋 100 家電視台。 她在佛羅裡達、加利福尼亞、羅德島和紐約均持有房產，目前正以近 1000 萬美元的價格出售其紐約頂層公寓。 10. 席琳 · 狄翁（Celine Dion）：榜上第 64 名，資產 5.7 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比增加 4％。 席琳 · 狄翁在 2022 年公開確診患有罕見疾病「僵硬人症候群」（一種無法治癒的自體免疫疾病）的消息後，暫停了她傳奇的演唱生涯。 去年 6 月，記錄她與病魔抗爭的紀錄片《我是：席琳狄翁》（I Am: Celine Dion）在亞馬遜 (AMZN-US) Prime Video 上線。 去年 7 月，這位天后在巴黎奧運開幕式上復出獻唱，驚艷全世界。 11. 芭芭拉 · 史翠珊（Barbra Streisand）：榜上第 71 名，資產 5.1 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比增加 11%。 實力唱將史翠珊將於 6 月推出全新對唱專輯，特邀保羅 · 麥卡尼（Paul McCartney）、巴布 · 迪倫（Bob Dylan）、瑪麗亞 · 凱莉（Mariah Carey）和雅瑞安娜 · 格蘭德 （Ariana Grande）等巨星助陣。 她在馬里布價值 1.27 億美元的豪宅雖在今年 1 月遭遇山火威脅，最終倖免於難。 12. 艾倫 · 狄珍妮（Ellen DeGeneres）：榜上第 78 名，資產 4.5 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比持平
2024 年美國總統大選落幕不久，前脫口秀主持人狄珍妮便開始大規模拋售其在美國的豪華地產組合，據傳狄珍妮已攜演員妻子波蒂亞 · 德 · 羅西（Portia de Rossi）移居英國。 其名下最引人注目的資產，位於加州聖塔芭芭拉附近、佔地 10 英畝的超級豪宅，最終以約 9,600 萬美元的價格出售給礦業大亨羅伯特 · 費里德蘭（Robert Friedland）。 13. 桃莉 · 巴頓（Dolly Parton）：榜上第 78 名，資產 4.5 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比持平
與巴頓相伴近六十載的丈夫卡爾 · 托馬斯 · 迪恩（Carl Thomas Dean）於今年 3 月離世。 這位素來低調的伴侶數十年來默默支持巴頓的事業，鮮少在公開場合露面。 情人節當天，這位樂壇傳奇與莎賓娜 · 卡本特（Sabrina Carpenter）聯手推出了全新演繹版《Please, Please Please》，打入公告牌排行榜。 2024 年，她還與碧昂絲合作打造了另一支熱門單曲 Tyrant。 14. 瑞絲 · 薇斯朋（Reese Witherspoon）：榜上第 82 名，資產 4.4 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比持平
2021 年，薇斯朋在名人背書內容公司估值泡沫達到頂峰時，出售了其製作公司 Hello Sunshine 的多數股權。 如今該公司市值已不足當年售出時 9 億美元估值的三分之一。..."

Cioè: ho realizzato solo l'altro giorno che siamo ancora in primavera!!! – sbattendoci in faccia che, per quanto caldo farà, sarà sempre meno di quello che patiremo in futuro. Ok. Lo sappiamo. Non ditecelo più, vi prego.

Cani che viaggiano meglio di me | @pacos.place Shopping per il mare: già comprati, nei desideri e nei piani a breve termine! Costume intero animalier, grande must-have: il tocco wild al mare non guasta mai, anche se il safari sarà ai Bagni Diana di Laigueglia e non alla Diani Beach del Kenya. Maledetto Sol de Janeiro che fa questi spray numerati che inebriano di profumo corpo e capelli! Il mio preferito è il n°87 che sa totalmente di mare e vacanze. La wishlist da Lanapo sarebbe infinita, compresa la crema solare grafica e nostalgica Mi Ricordi il Mare che fa tanto estate italiana. Poco più a destra vedete il berretto con la visiera che merita di oltrepassare i confini liguri perché siamo tutti d'accordo che Focaccia e Mare è un mantra universalmente riconosciuto. Lo stick rosso di Fenty Beauty è il prodotto tutto in uno che ci porta all'aperitivo in spiaggia in modo superlativo: via la salsedine dal viso e stick idratante che colora guance e labbra adattandosi alla pelle per apparire più luminose e curate. Shopping per il mare e per il caldo già avvenuto un paio di anni fa, ce l'ho color crema e mi piace constatare che sia ancora riproposta, ora in versione madreperla: non giudicate la pinza per capelli con le ciliegie perché è necessaria come un lettino in prima fila. Fantastica la t-shirt bianca con la scritta Scandalo al Sole! , dichiara subito che siamo in modalità dolce vita. Vale anche in ufficio. Ok, la t-shirt bianca sta bene con tutto, ma che bella coi pantaloni larghi che mixano colore e cultura, mood vacanziero on. Veniamo alla nota dolente della mia wishilist di inizio estate: l'abito chemisier di Gerard Darel, visto dal vivo in negozio e molto (molto) più bello che in foto. Il prezzo è molto (molto) più brutto di quello che avrei desiderato. H&M che propone spesso degli ottimi costumi da bagno che durano nel tempo, ha in assortimento questo bikini giallo burro in vari modelli e forme di reggiseno e slip: quello coi volants è romantico e delicato come un gelato alla crema. Shopping per il mare che devo fare in presenza, nei camerini, piangendo tutte le lacrime al sapore di carbonara e tiramisù. Preso nel corner coreano del centro commerciale di Arese, per poi scoprire che su Amazon l'avrei pagato meno: lo stick SPF 50 di Beauty of Joseon è da comprare a occhi chiusi. Assolutamente impalpabile e leggero, non lascia alcuna traccia, è la protezione ideale da mettere (e rimettere) durante il giorno, e finalmente ho trovato il prodotto perfetto da utlizzare anche sopra al make-up senza che si disfi tutto. Decenni di successi hanno decretato che chi non possiede un paio di sandali piatti color cuoio, praticamente non vive l'estate chic. Quelli col dettaglio dorato sono essenziali ma hanno quel tocco gold che fa quiet luxury. Vi siete già sventolate in questi giorni? Io sì, con annessi amici che si avvicinano per rinfrescarsi da parassiti. Ecco, nella borsa devo assolutamente aggiungere il ventaglio La Vacanza, alleato contro l'afa da tirare fuori con nonchalance (finché non oserò col ventilatore da collo!).

mov_FB6ED16290307B5F31FEEA60C86D16B9,2025-06-18 09:00:44,en,WEB,"  I have never known a category soar as suddenly as setting spray. It existed for aeons, with the best of them (Urban Decay's All Nighter, £29.50, which still has second-to-none longevity) rarely threatened by anything new. But countless sprays have launched in the past year, all of them promising to significantly increase the lifespan of makeup. There's an argument that “fixing sprays” and “setting sprays” have different purposes (locking down makeup versus providing a more unified, less powdery finish, respectively), but I dismiss it because it's based on the generous assumption that the marketeers who name products according to popular Google search terms give a hoot for semantic nuance. Here, I mean sprays that do all of the above, drastically reducing makeup fade and wear, even during dancing, hot flushing or perspiring. My favourite in recent years is Charlotte Tilbury's Airbrush Flawless Setting Spray (£32), since it best combines staying power with a natural, complexion-enhancing look. It scores extra points for its ability to stay smooth when powder or an evening makeup change is later applied over the top. When I arrived for a 16-hour day and realised I'd forgotten to apply this spray, I went to buy one But giving it a run for its money is Fenty Beauty's new You Mist (£28). This has a finer spray, no fragrance and comparable staying power. It doesn't have the same satiny look, but is similar in that it doesn't alter the texture of makeup. It's a fantastic product upon which I've become so dependent that last month, when I arrived in London for a 16-hour day and realised I'd forgotten to apply it, I went straight to Boots to buy one. The best setting spray on the high street is Milani's Make It Last (£14.50). It is an excellent performer at a fair price that keeps makeup fast without dryness, itchiness, tightness or colour changing. However, I specifically mean the spray marked “Original”. I recently bought the SPF version in the US and my eyes streamed profusely until I washed it off. The lasting effect of L'Oreal's Infallible 3-Second Setting Mist (£9.99) is phenomenal, but it is pipped by the Milani because it smells a bit too much like hairspray. If you find setting sprays feel too wet upon application, Kosas's new Cloud Set Airy Setting + Smoothing Mist (£32), does exactly what it says on the pack. The unfragranced, monsoon-like mist coats evenly, coolly and comfortably, and gives a smooth, slightly blurry finish. It's ideal for those who want their lighter, more natural-looking makeup to last as long as a face full. Stylist: Yvonne Achato. Lighting assistant: Declan Slattery"

《富比士》最新發布 2025 年「美國最富白手起家女性榜單」（America's Richest Self-Made Women），共有 16 位女星成功上榜。 該名單涵蓋企業家、娛樂圈名人與高階主管。 榜單入圍門檻提高至 3.5 億美元，高於去年的 3 億與 2023 年的 2.25 億美元，顯示女性財富門檻持續提升。 《富比士》雜誌公布2025年美國白手起家女富豪榜（圖：富比士）
2025 年榜單中，女星總資產累計達 141 億美元，高於去年 133 億。 其中最大推力來自首次上榜的賽琳娜 · 戈梅茲（Selena Gomez），以 7 億美元資產躍居第 48 名，幾乎貢獻全部增幅。 16 位上榜女星資產亮眼，詳情一覽
1. 歐普拉 · 溫芙蕾 （Oprah Winfrey）：榜上第 13 名，資產 31 億美元，較 2024 年上榜時增長 3%
儘管其冠名脫口秀停播已近十五年，歐普拉依然活躍在螢幕前，她不但出演了 Netflix 電影，還在過去一年主持了三檔電視特輯。 據報導，她還於去年豪擲 7500 萬美元，購入一架新私人飛機，並在夏威夷持有大量豪宅。 曾參與投資的 WeightWatchers（她於 2024 年 5 月退出董事會）於今年 5 月申請破產。 2. 金 · 卡戴珊 （Kim Kardashian）：榜上第 19 名，資產 17 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時持平
今年 2 月，卡戴珊年銷售額近 9 億美元的塑身衣品牌 Skims 與運動鞋服巨頭 Nike(NKE-US) 推出聯名品牌 NikeSkims，系列產品預計在未來幾個月內上市。 3 月，美妝集團科蒂 (COTY-US) 剝離了其持有的卡戴珊護膚品牌 SKKN by Kim 的 20% 股權，此次剝離導致公司錄得 7100 萬美元的虧損。 3. 泰勒絲（Taylor Swift）：榜上第 21 名，資產 16 億美元，較 2024 年上榜時增長 23%
經過 54 座城市 149 場演出後，泰勒絲的「時代」巡演於去年 12 月結束，成為音樂史上最成功的巡迴演出，光是票房收入就突破 20 億美元，是先前紀錄的兩倍。 除演唱會門票外，這位全球巨星還發掘了多種方式將死忠粉的熱情轉化為真金白銀，其中就包括電影、書籍以及專輯重錄。 過去兩年間，這些項目總計為她帶來逾 2 億美元的收入。 5 月下旬，她從私募股權公司 Shamrock Capital 手中購回了前六張專輯的母帶版權，首次實現了對自己全部音樂作品的完全掌控。 4. 蕾哈娜（Rihanna）：榜上第 35 名，資產 10 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比減少 29%
流行天后蕾哈娜的主要業務部門接連受挫，財富縮水 4 億美元。 2024 年 8 月，其內衣品牌 Savage X Fenty 的 CEO 離職轉投維多利亞的秘密。 與 LVMH 集團合資的 Fenty Beauty 美妝線銷售成長乏力，LVMH 直言「市場環境嚴峻」。 5. 瑪丹娜（Madonna）：榜上第 42 名，資產 8.5 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比持平
出道 40 餘年的蕾哈娜仍在創造傳奇。 去年 12 月她在社群媒體透露正在籌備新專輯，並喊話：「2025 年了，誰想聽新歌！」 此前其 Celebration 巡迴演唱會於 5 月收官，斬獲 2.3 億美元票房，這是她自 2001 年以來第六次巡演票房破億。 6. 碧昂絲（Beyoncé）：榜上第 45 名，資產 7.8 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比增加 4%
4 月底，流行天后碧昂絲正式啟動「牛仔卡特」巡迴演唱會，今夏將在歐美九座城市舉辦 32 場體育場級演出。 7. 席琳娜 · 戈梅茲 （Selena Gomez）：榜上第 48 名，資產 7 億美元，新上榜
五年前，戈梅茲創立了以個人第三張錄音室專輯命名的美妝品牌 Rare Beauty。 該品牌以明星產品液體腮紅走紅，透過官網和絲芙蘭通路銷售，去年營收約 3.7 億美元。 根據《富比士》評估，該品牌估值達 13 億美元，戈梅茲持有至少 51% 股份。 這位迪士尼頻道出身的明星如今在熱門影集《破案三人行》（Only Murders in the Building）中身兼主演與聯合製片人，單集片酬達 60 萬美元（目前已播出 40 集）。 去年 12 月，她以電影《璀璨女人夢》（Emilia Pérez）獲得金球獎最佳女配角提名。 今年 3 月，她與音樂製作人未婚夫班尼 · 布蘭柯（Benny Blanco）聯合推出了新專輯。 8. 凱莉．詹娜（Kylie Jenner）：榜上第 52 名，資產 6.7 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比減少 6%。 儘管科蒂集團已出售其同母異父姐姐金卡戴珊護膚品牌的股份，但對 Kylie Cosmetics 的表現頗為滿意，特別肯定了其在印度、新加坡等新興市場的成功擴張。 凱莉新推出的 Cosmic 香水系列似乎也拉動了銷售成長。 雖然這成為科蒂財報的亮點，但美容類股票估值普遍走低，該集團股價自去年以來已暴跌 50%。 凱莉去年還跨界推出了罐裝伏特加軟飲 Sprinter。 9. 茱蒂 · 夏德林（Judy Sheindlin）：榜上第 61 名，資產 5.8 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比增加 4％。 今年 1 月，這位以「朱迪法官」之稱而為人所知的電視仲裁專家夏德林與亞馬遜續簽合約，其製作的《Judy Justice》節目仍保持每年 120 集的高產量，不僅在串流媒體平台播出，還透過聯合發行模式覆蓋 100 家電視台。 她在佛羅裡達、加利福尼亞、羅德島和紐約均持有房產，目前正以近 1000 萬美元的價格出售其紐約頂層公寓。 10. 席琳 · 狄翁（Celine Dion）：榜上第 64 名，資產 5.7 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比增加 4％。 席琳 · 狄翁在 2022 年公開確診患有罕見疾病「僵硬人症候群」（一種無法治癒的自體免疫疾病）的消息後，暫停了她傳奇的演唱生涯。 去年 6 月，記錄她與病魔抗爭的紀錄片《我是：席琳狄翁》（I Am: Celine Dion）在亞馬遜 (AMZN-US) Prime Video 上線。 去年 7 月，這位天后在巴黎奧運開幕式上復出獻唱，驚艷全世界。 11. 芭芭拉 · 史翠珊（Barbra Streisand）：榜上第 71 名，資產 5.1 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比增加 11%。 實力唱將史翠珊將於 6 月推出全新對唱專輯，特邀保羅 · 麥卡尼（Paul McCartney）、巴布 · 迪倫（Bob Dylan）、瑪麗亞 · 凱莉（Mariah Carey）和雅瑞安娜 · 格蘭德 （Ariana Grande）等巨星助陣。 她在馬里布價值 1.27 億美元的豪宅雖在今年 1 月遭遇山火威脅，最終倖免於難。 12. 艾倫 · 狄珍妮（Ellen DeGeneres）：榜上第 78 名，資產 4.5 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比持平
2024 年美國總統大選落幕不久，前脫口秀主持人狄珍妮便開始大規模拋售其在美國的豪華地產組合，據傳狄珍妮已攜演員妻子波蒂亞 · 德 · 羅西（Portia de Rossi）移居英國。 其名下最引人注目的資產，位於加州聖塔芭芭拉附近、佔地 10 英畝的超級豪宅，最終以約 9600 萬美元的價格出售給礦業大亨羅伯特 · 費里德蘭（Robert Friedland）。 13. 桃莉 · 巴頓（Dolly Parton）：榜上第 78 名，資產 4.5 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比持平
與巴頓相伴近六十載的丈夫卡爾 · 托馬斯 · 迪恩（Carl Thomas Dean）於今年 3 月離世。 這位素來低調的伴侶數十年來默默支持巴頓的事業，鮮少在公開場合露面。 情人節當天，這位樂壇傳奇與莎賓娜 · 卡本特（Sabrina Carpenter）聯手推出了全新演繹版《Please Please Please》，打入公告牌排行榜。 2024 年，她還與碧昂絲合作打造了另一支熱門單曲 Tyrant。 14. 瑞絲 · 薇斯朋（Reese Witherspoon）：榜上第 82 名，資產 4.4 億美元，與 2024 年上榜時相比持平
2021 年，薇斯朋在名人背書內容公司估值泡沫達到頂峰時，出售了其製作公司 Hello Sunshine 的多數股權。 如今該公司市值已不足當年售出時 9 億美元估值的三分之一。..."
mov_3AA325D93D9B4D8CD55ECE1B7FE0C48F,2025-06-18 23:54:40,en,WEB,"  As consumers become more conscious of their environmental footprint, the demand for sustainable products with luxury appeal has exploded. This shift isn't just a passing trend—it's creating a new kind of market: eco-luxury, where sustainability meets premium design. And for startups, e-commerce platforms, and investors, it's a goldmine hiding in plain sight. The rise of conscious capitalism Eco-consciousness is no longer a niche. Today's consumer—especially millennials and Gen Z—expects companies to align with their values. This has given rise to brands that blend design, ethics, and sustainability, with products that feel indulgent but leave a lighter impact. We're seeing this across sectors: fashion, food, wellness, and home goods. From Tesla's all-electric Plaid lineup to refillable luxury skincare brands like Fenty Skin, the fusion of eco and elite is creating billion-dollar categories. The tech layer behind eco-luxury What's driving this growth? Smart tech. From blockchain-backed supply chains to AI-powered personalization in online storefronts, innovation is making sustainable luxury scalable. For example, Shopify and WooCommerce have evolved to support not just product delivery but carbon offset integration, ethical sourcing tags, and smart logistics. Tools like Ecocart, Planet, and even Amazon's Climate Pledge Friendly badge show how sustainability can be quantified—and marketed—in real time. This tech-backed transparency allows smaller luxury brands to build credibility fast, especially in a market that values authenticity and traceability as much as the product itself. Opportunity in niche categories While fashion and beauty dominate the headlines, home and baby goods are rapidly gaining attention. These categories benefit from loyal, purpose-driven customers willing to pay for premium materials and aesthetic value. Take the boom in heirloom-quality nursery items, for instance. Search volume and social media buzz have grown around handcrafted, ethically made children's furniture and décor. One standout example is Finn + Emma's —a beautifully made, ethically crafted baby swing that has gone viral thanks to its design appeal and organic materials. Though the swing itself isn't groundbreaking technology, what's fascinating is how a niche product like this finds traction through smart e-commerce tools, Instagram algorithms, and SEO-optimized marketplaces like Etsy and Amazon Handmade. It's a case study in how small-batch, sustainable goods can scale using modern platforms and analytics. Investors are paying attention Venture capital and private equity firms are increasingly investing in sustainable DTC (direct-to-consumer) brands with clear missions and scalable supply chains. Luxury brands like Allbirds and Veja have already proven that eco doesn't mean sacrificing growth. Analysts project that the global ethical luxury market will surpass $100 billion by 2030. For founders, the time is now to build smart, value-driven businesses that can ride the wave of conscious consumerism. For tech entrepreneurs, the opportunity lies in building the infrastructure that supports these brands, including payment systems, sustainability scoring tools, ethical sourcing platforms, and e-commerce enhancements. The bottom line Eco-luxury is not just a consumer movement—it's a business model. With the right tech stack and a genuine mission, founders can tap into this expanding market. Whether you're building backend logistics or launching a lifestyle brand, the message is clear: sustainable can be stylish, and ethical can be profitable."

If you're stocking up on sunscreen for a family holiday, you'll know that packing enough SPF to keep everyone safe can soon add up. The good news is that sunscreen is often available on sale. Whether you need a body sunscreen to pack in your suitcase this summer or a reliable SPF moisturiser to wear all year round, there are plenty of deals to be found on some of our favourite tried and tested formulas. We've rooted through the best deals at Boots, Amazon, Lookfantastic and more to bring you the best offers. This will ensure that you never have to pay full price for your sun protection.

mov_C1DBDB80662BE9D40D257753F199EED6,2025-06-20 04:16:03,en,WEB,"  Ahead of the winner announcement at Next in Vogue in October, read more about the three shortlisted finalists for the Innovation Prize and the ethos behind their distinctive brands Facebook Twitter WhatsApp Facebook Messender Telegram This year, the Vogue Singapore x BMW Innovation Prize returns to spotlight the brightest entrepreneurial minds reimagining fashion, sustainability, and technology across Asia and beyond. A collaboration with BMW, the programme champions fashion and beauty innovators building the future of design through cross-industry creativity, circular systems, and digital transformation. Applications came in from all around the globe, and after an intensive two-day bootcamp, ten standout businesses were chosen to move forward into a three-week mentorship programme. Participants had the valuable opportunity to work with esteemed leaders from world-class institutions, including Renzo Vitale, Creative Director Sound at BMW Group, Corey Moran, Head of Industry, Fashion and Luxury at Google, Artaud Frenoy, Head of APAC at VEJA, and Nanette Wong, Vice President of Global Brand Marketing at Fenty Beauty & Fenty Fragrance, among others. Their final pitch was presented to an internal jury composed of the Vogue Singapore and Brinc teams, alongside global investors. From this pool, three finalists emerged—Arxy, Authentified, and BioFluff—each chosen for their distinctive vision, clear roadmap, and capacity to spark real change. These three companies will now face the VIP jury, comprised of global leaders at the forefront of luxury, innovation, and design. Among them: Bettina von Schlippe, Vogue Singapore's Publisher-at-Large, Alexis Bonhomme, founder of Trinity Asia, Natasha Damodaran, Vogue Singapore's publisher, Rose du Chatellier, Senior Director of Strategic Initiatives at Condé Nast, and Oliver Heilmer, Head of Design BMW Compact Class and Neue Klasse, BMW M. For Heilmer, whose team is pioneering BMW's next-generation vehicles under the Neue Klasse vision, the innovation prize reflects an aligned mission: “BMW has a strong history and has always strived to resolve contradictions: to create a design that meets the spirit of the times and thus remains timeless. In many ways, the Vogue Singapore x BMW Innovation Prize is aimed to bring about change in a similar way, and I am thrilled for BMW and myself to support this project”. He also emphasised the importance of cross-disciplinary inspiration. “For example, one person on our team builds skateboards, while another lived on a sailboat for two years—this is all part of indirect inspiration. These experiences feed into our collective design language—it's that creative discourse that drives innovation.” Indeed, the exchange of ideas between tech, fashion, design, and sustainability underpins the ethos of the programme, which culminates this October at Vogue Singapore's Next In Vogue gala. There, the winner will be announced and awarded a S$20,000 monetary prize, a feature by Vogue Singapore, a one-year membership at the Singapore Fashion Council, and—courtesy of VisitMonaco—a four-night stay at the Hôtel Metropole Monte-Carlo, with dinner at the two-Michelin-starred Les Ambassadeurs by Christophe Cussac. The winner will also receive mentorship from Monegasque institutions such as MonacoTech and be introduced to a global network of investors and industry leaders. Below, read on to find about more about the three shortlisted businesses and their innovative visions. Artzy is the world's first fully immersive and interactive virtual showroom platform for B2B wholesale. Courtesy of Arxy Touted as the world's first fully immersive and interactive virtual showroom platform for B2B wholesale, Arxy is redefining how brands and retailers connect. By addressing the outdated and unsustainable nature of traditional wholesale—which relies on costly physical showrooms, international travel, and excessive sample production— Arxy offers scalable, sustainable, and cost-efficient tools designed to modernise the wholesale process. These entrenched practices not only slow down operations but also raise barriers for small brands and contribute to the industry's carbon footprint. Arxy's mission is to build a dynamic, collaborative, and tech-forward ecosystem that cuts costs, reduces waste, and expands reach—empowering the next generation of fashion creatives to thrive. Since its launch, Arxy has rapidly gained industry recognition. The company was selected twice by Vogue Business as one of the ten tech startups set to reshape the fashion industry, presenting at Fashion Futures in both New York and London. In early 2025, it unveiled a virtual talent showroom for Istituto Marangoni, earning press coverage and widespread interest; the institution has since engaged Arxy on two further projects and named them their exclusive technology partner in this field. Today, Arxy works with over 20 brands, including Veronique Leroy and Annakiki, and has attracted over 300 retailers across 36 countries, from LuisaViaRoma and Saks to well-established regional retailers. Most recently, the company was invited to showcase at the Global Fashion Summit 2025 and host a workshop in Jakarta, further cementing its place at the forefront of fashion's digital evolution. Authentified provides the back-end technology to connect brands, customers and secondhand marketplaces for efficient resale. Courtesy of Authentified Authentified is building the back‑end infrastructure to power seamless, brand‑led resale at scale. The platform integrates directly with fashion brands—such as launch partner Decjuba, which generated over 500 listings in its first week following its February 2025 debut—connecting them and their customers to established secondhand marketplaces like eBay. This integration enables brands to embrace resale on their own terms: earning royalties, accessing valuable post‑purchase data, and driving ongoing customer engagement. Customers, in turn, benefit from a resale experience that's easy, trusted, and fully brand‑backed. With additional partnerships including Australia Post and Salvos Stores to support logistics and donations, Authentified is laying the foundation for effortless, circular fashion at scale. Since launch, the platform has grown to support over 1,500 registered users and has facilitated the sale of more than 1,400 items, with strong momentum across both brand and customer adoption. Authentified currently partners with Decjuba, Bared Footwear, Kivari, and Cambridge Clothing, with two more marketplace integrations in discussion. The team recently launched a live brand dashboard and has received positive feedback from major retailers during ongoing meetings. Recognition has followed swiftly: Authentified was selected for the eBay Circular Fashion Fund, named a LaunchVic Top 30 Best Newcomer, shortlisted for the AFR Sustainability Leaders Award 2025 (via Decjuba), and was a finalist at Power Retail Big Bash 2025 in both the Top Sustainability Initiative and Top Innovator categories. BioFluff is the world's first 100% plant-based fur, shearling, and plush alternative. Courtesy of Biofluff Born from a bold ambition to phase out both animal-derived and plastic-based furs, BioFluff is the world's first 100% plant-based alternative to fur, shearling, and plush. Its flagship material, Savian, is crafted in Italy from flax, nettle, and hemp fibres—offering a high-luxury textile with a remarkably low environmental footprint. The material made its high-profile debut at COP28 in December 2023, appearing as part of Stella McCartney's Pre-Fall 2024 collection, where it garnered global attention as a pioneering sustainable innovation.

If you're stocking up on sunscreen for a family holiday, you'll know that packing enough SPF to keep everyone safe can soon add up. The good news is that sunscreen is often available on sale. Whether you need a body sunscreen to pack in your suitcase this summer or a reliable SPF moisturiser to wear all year round, there are plenty of deals to be found on some of our favourite tried and tested formulas. We've rooted through the best deals at Boots, Amazon, Lookfantastic and more to bring you the best offers. This will ensure that you never have to pay full price for your sun protection. If you're heading off on holiday soon, don't wait until you're at the airport to buy your sunscreen. Prices are often higher airside, so if you're checking in a suitcase, stock up before you travel. You might be tempted to buy travel-sized sunscreens if you're only travelling with hand luggage. However, you'll likely end up paying more per 100ml, and if you use the recommended amount (six to eight teaspoons to cover your whole body), you may need to top up while on holiday. Our top tip is to use the Boots airside click and collect service. You'll have to pay a £4.50 fee and select a delivery date at least three days before you fly, but this gives you the chance to make full use of Boots' wide range of online sunscreen offers.

mov_262D58FB554777042433F304500C3BF9,2025-06-20 14:55:34,en,WEB,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Rihanna may be worth over $1.4 billion, but she's not too rich for a fast food fix. The 37-year-old superstar, currently expecting her third child with A$AP Rocky, was spotted indulging a budget-friendly craving at the iconic Southern California burger chain Fatburger on Friday. Dressed in a ruffled light brown summer dress with a baseball cap and Puma sneakers, the Fenty Beauty mogul looked runway-ready—even with a fast food drink in hand. Pregnancy craving or not, she still pulled off her signature style with ease. Rihanna appeared in high spirits during the outing, despite still mourning the loss of her father Ronald Fenty, who tragically passed away in May at age 70. Meanwhile, her ex Chris Brown was back in court—this time in the UK—where he pleaded not guilty to an alleged bottle attack at a London nightclub. Appearing at Southwark Crown Court this morning, 36-year-old singer pleaded not guilty to charges stemming from an alleged assault on music producer Abraham Diaw in February 2023. Brown—who previously made headlines in 2009 for violently assaulting then-girlfriend Rihanna, a case that led to a felony conviction and lasting public backlash—is now accused of attempting to inflict grievous bodily harm with intent. Prosecutors allege that Brown, alongside co-defendant Omololu Akinlolu, 38—a rapper and producer from Dallas—carried out the attack at the Tape nightclub in Hanover Square, Mayfair, on February 19, 2023. Both men face charges of causing grievous bodily harm and assault occasioning actual bodily harm. In addition, Brown is facing a separate charge for possession of an offensive weapon. Meanwhile, Rihanna has not yet publicly addressed the death of her father. Previously, Rihanna and her father were estranged before they eventually reconciled in recent years. In 2019, she sued her dad and claimed he capitalized on her business empire. In her filing, she alleged that his Fenty Management talent firm profited off of her Fenty Beauty line and other trademarked eponymous ventures. Two years later, she filed to dismiss the lawsuit and had seemingly mended her relationship with him. In 2023, when Rihanna and Rocky were expecting their second child together, Fenty gushed over his daughter and shared his excitement of becoming a grandfather to another one of their babies. Fenty shared three children with his ex-wife Braithwaite including Rihanna, Rajad and Rorrey. Around the time Rihanna's career in music was taking off in 2002, her parents split up. In addition to Rihanna, Fenty is survived by his grandchildren including Rihanna and Rocky's sons RZA, two, Riot Rose, 18 months, and their baby on the way. He is also survived by his other children Rajad, Rorrey as well as Kandy, Samantha, Jamie and multiple grandchildren. Last month, Rihanna insisted her new album won't be delayed too much by her pregnancy. Speaking to Entertainment Tonight, the Umbrella hitmaker was asked if the album - which has been dubbed 'R9' - will be 'put on pause even longer'. She insisted: 'No, maybe a couple of videos.' Fans have been waiting nine years for the follow-up to 2016's Anti, but Rihanna has assured them that her plans are still in place."
71818e6f748bb42aef9a7529634f641a,2025-06-20 14:58:00,en,WEB,"  Introduction I remember when my agency signed a $250,000 deal with a celebrity influencer for a year-long campaign, only to have them post controversial content that tanked our client's brand reputation overnight? Yeah, that was a fun conversation with the CEO. That disaster led me down the rabbit hole of AI avatars, and honestly, it's been a game-changer. We're talking about digital spokespersons that never have bad days, never go off-script, and never end up in tabloid scandals. The rise of AI avatars is happening faster than most people realize. Virtual influencers like Lil Miquela have millions of followers, and brands are pouring serious money into digital spokespeople. We're not talking about some futuristic concept – this is happening right now. Why brands are ditching human influencers: After managing influencer campaigns for 8 years, I've seen every possible disaster. Scheduling nightmares, contract disputes, personal drama affecting brand image, and the constant fear that your spokesperson might say something stupid on Twitter at 3 AM. Here's what we're covering: Three bulletproof reasons why AI avatars are becoming the smarter choice for brand representation. These aren't theoretical benefits – they're practical advantages I've seen firsthand after implementing AI avatar strategies for 23 different clients. The Shift Towards AI-Driven Brand Representation What Are AI Avatars? AI avatars are digitally created personalities powered by artificial intelligence that can speak, interact, and represent brands across multiple platforms. They're not just animated characters – they're sophisticated AI systems that can hold conversations, adapt their messaging, and even learn from customer interactions. Think of them as the evolution of brand mascots, but with the ability to actually communicate in real-time with your audience. Real examples making waves: • Lil Miquela: 3 million Instagram followers, earning $10 million annually through brand partnerships • Shudu: The world's first digital supermodel, working with luxury brands like Fenty Beauty • Knox Frost: Virtual influencer with 1.2 million followers, partnering with major fashion brands I was skeptical at first too, but when one of our AI avatar campaigns generated 340% more engagement than traditional influencer content, I became a believer. Why Brands Are Rethinking Traditional Influencers The influencer marketing bubble is bursting, and smart brands are jumping ship before it gets worse. Cost is getting ridiculous. Top-tier influencers now charge $500,000+ for a single campaign. Meanwhile, creating an AI avatar costs around $50,000 upfront and can work 24/7 for years without additional fees. Control is non-existent. When you hire a human influencer, you're essentially renting their personality and hoping they don't do anything stupid. With AI avatars, you own the entire brand persona. Scalability is impossible. Your human spokesperson can't be in 50 different markets simultaneously, speaking 12 different languages perfectly. An AI avatar can. Last year, we had a client's campaign completely derailed because their influencer got into a Twitter beef with a competitor's spokesperson. The whole thing went viral for all the wrong reasons, and we had to pull a $2 million campaign. That's when I knew we needed a better solution. Best AI Avatar Software HeyGen HeyGen is like the Swiss Army knife of AI avatar creation. You can create photorealistic avatars that speak any language with perfect lip-sync and natural gestures. What it does: Creates AI-powered video avatars that can deliver scripted content in over 100 languages. The avatars look incredibly realistic and can be customized for different demographics and brand personalities. Pros: • Extremely realistic facial expressions and lip-syncing • Multi-language support without accent issues • Fast video generation (usually under 5 minutes) • Extensive customization options for appearance and voice • Integration with popular marketing platforms Cons: • Limited to pre-scripted content (can't handle real-time conversations) • Higher learning curve for advanced customization • Occasional uncanny valley effects in certain lighting conditions Pricing: Starts at $29/month for basic features, $89/month for business use, custom enterprise pricing for large-scale deployments. Synthesia Synthesia is the platform I recommend most to clients who want professional-grade AI avatars without the technical headaches. What it does: Creates AI presenters that can deliver any text script as natural-looking video content. Perfect for training videos, product demos, and marketing content. Pros: • User-friendly interface that non-technical teams can master • High-quality avatars with natural gestures and expressions • Template library for quick video creation • Strong enterprise features and security • Excellent customer support and onboarding Cons: • More expensive than some competitors • Limited avatar customization compared to other platforms • Can feel slightly robotic for casual, conversational content Pricing: $30/month for personal use, $67/month for business, enterprise plans start at $500/month with volume discounts.

mov_DF8D0B56CC55F9BF2EE80F7255E5A08A,2025-06-20 18:02:10,en,WEB,"  Not sure where to apply blush? You're not alone. Despite being one of the buzziest makeup products in recent years, wearing blush can be confusing with all the different application trends and product formulations available. TikTok has helped hacks like W blush and sundae blush go viral, while brands are offering cream blush, liquid blush, and powder blush options. So, how do you figure out which product and method is right for you? First, it's important to focus on what blush is designed to achieve. According to Hayley Kassel, a makeup artist and beauty photographer who has worked on campaigns for Fenty Beauty and ColorPop, blush has a simple function. “Overall applying blush can add warmth, dimension, and a healthy glow to your face,” she says. In some instances, it can also function like contour or highlighter to sculpt the face. “If you want a lifted look, try placing blush above your cheekbones, closer to highlighter placement,” Kassel adds. Most important of all, blush is whatever you want it to be. The viral term “blush blindness,” used to describe a person wearing too much blush, isn't real. “I'm a bit of a blush enthusiast, if you will, so I love any sort of blush in any sort of way,” says Kassel. Ahead, we asks professional makeup artists everything you need to know about where to apply blush. Where should you apply blush? Your blush placement all depends on the look you're trying to achieve. Want a youthful flush? “Keep the blush more centered on the apples of your cheeks,” says Kassel. “You can also blend the blush downward for a very 'romantic renaissance' vibe.” For a more natural look, Kassel recommends using your fingers. “I love to dab the blush across the nose and chin to create a cohesive, sun-kissed glow,” she says. Courtesy of brand Pat McGrath Labs Divine Cream Blush: Legendary Glow Color Balm $29 Nordstrom Rhode Pocket Blush Plum $24 Rhode Courtesy of brand Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Matte Bouncy Blush $27 Sephora Tower 28 Beauty GetSet Blur + Set Matte Powder Blush $22 Revolve How to apply blush According to Clarissa Luna, a celebrity makeup artist whose clients include Megan Fox, Lana Condor, and JoJo, the best way to apply blush is to start with less. “You can always build blush to your desired intensity. I always start applying powder or cream blush, at the top back of the cheekbone and bring it forward, towards your nose,” says Luna. Once you've created a base blush, then you can go in with any additional product. “You can always finish any blush look by applying what's left on your brush, sponge or fingertips, on the bridge of your nose, forehead and chin, to bring your look together.” Courtesy of brand Rare Beauty Soft Pinch Liquid Blush $24 Amazon Huda Beauty Blush Filter Soft Glow Liquid Blush Bubblegum $32 Sephora Saie Dew Blush in Poppy $25..."

If you're looking for some serious fashion inspiration in New York City, look no further than the Barclays Center in Brooklyn, where you'll find the boldest looks on the New York Liberty players and fans alike! That's because the Liberty has teamed up with Rihanna's Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin for a game-changing beauty partnership! Fenty Beauty has a history of supporting women athletes, but this is the brand's first official WNBA partnership. So, what does that mean for the Liberty? Fenty Beauty logos will now grace the team's official pregame warm-up jackets and shooting shirts - making the brand an essential part of the team's identity. Fenty will also engage with fans through in-arena activations and product discovery moments, ensuring everyone feels a part of the action. (Don't worry - Liberty's lovable mascot, Ellie the Elephant, won't be left out of the fun!) Rihanna herself is excited about the partnership, telling Allure, ""Makeup is there to have fun with, to express yourself with. I'm excited to see how these incredible women of the New York Liberty put their game faces on and am proud to have Fenty Beauty and Fenty Skin be a part of their story this season."" This partnership isn't just a casual team-up; it's a strategic move that reflects the shared values of empowerment, authenticity, and boundary-pushing in both the beauty and sports realms. It's also part of a larger trend where beauty brands are linking up with women's sports, capitalizing on the growing momentum and fan base of leagues like the WNBA. For the New York Liberty, this partnership brings heightened visibility and prestige, aligning the team with a global cultural icon and a multi-billion-dollar brand known for its innovation and inclusivity. It also enhances the fan experience with in-game activations and branded merchandise, deepening fan loyalty and engagement. Finally, the partnership redefines how beauty and sports intersect, creating a culturally meaningful collaboration that celebrates female empowerment on and off the court. Fans benefit from fresh, stylish branding and likely exclusive promotions or events tied to the Liberty's games and community initiatives. In short, this partnership delivers a modern, authentic approach to sports sponsorship that supports both Fenty Beauty's commercial ambitions and the Liberty's cultural and competitive aspirations. It's a powerful synergy that benefits the team, its fans, and the broader movement of women's sports. So grab your seats, some Fenty Beauty goodies, and get ready for a season of unforgettable looks on the court! - The partnership between Fenty Beauty and the New York Liberty extends beyond the beauty world, setting a trend in sports-fashion collaboration, particularly in the NBA, sports-analysis, and fashion-and-beauty fields. - As a result of this alliance, basketball fans can anticipate not only exceptional games but also stylish looks from the Liberty players and unique fan experiences that intertwine sports and lifestyle. - With their shared values of empowerment and inclusiveness, this partnership serves as a testament to how fashion and sports can unite to promote female empowerment both on and off the court, making the sporting event a fashion statement and transcending the traditional boundaries of both industries."

mov_899AD4D8255C2EFCBFB079062BED357A,2025-06-24 07:16:13,en,WEB,"  12:41 pm What's the story Rihanna, whose full name is Robyn Rihanna Fenty, has become a cultural icon in America, thanks to her multi-faceted career and impact. From the music scene to launching her own fashion and beauty lines, she has continuously broken barriers and set trends. Rihanna's influence goes beyond entertainment; she has become a true symbol of empowerment and innovation. Here's how. Music journey Musical breakthroughs and evolution Rihanna's journey started with her debut album Music of the Sun in 2005, a record that brought her distinctive voice to the world. Over the years, she musically evolved by trying her hand at multiple genres, including pop, R&B, reggae, and hip-hop. Her adaptability and innovation in the fickle music industry have kept her relevant for close to two decades. Tracks such as Umbrella, Diamonds, and Work have secured her place in music history. Fashion impact Fashion influence beyond trends Rihanna's influence spans into fashion, where she is known for crossing boundaries with daring sartorial choices. She launched Fenty Beauty in 2017 with an inclusive range of products for all skin tones. The move was revolutionary in the beauty industry as it focused on diversity and representation. Her fashion line under LVMH further cemented her status as a trendsetter who defies norms. Giving back Philanthropy and social advocacy Apart from entertaining us, Rihanna is also known for her philanthropic work through the Clara Lionel Foundation, set up in 2012. The foundation funds global education programs and emergency response programs around the world. She also utilizes her platform to speak on social issues like racial equality and women's rights, which strikes a chord with countless people from diverse communities. Entrepreneurial spirit Business ventures redefining success Rihanna's entrepreneurial ventures prove how artists can diversify their careers successfully beyond music/acting, etc. They range from launching the Savage X Fenty lingerie line, which spreads the message of body positivity among women across the globe. This defies the traditional beauty standards that exist today in society as a whole, therefore redefining the very meaning of success, not just financially, but culturally speaking too."

Rihanna — who is currently pregnant and expecting her third baby with partner A$AP Rocky — was born to Fenty and mother Monica Braithwaite in February 1988. (The couple are already parents to sons Rza, 3, and Riot, 1.) Along with Rihanna and Rajad, Fenty and Braithwaite were also parents to Rorrey. Rihanna also has three half-siblings from her father's previous relationships: sisters Samantha and Kandy, plus brother Jamie. Fenty and Braithwaite raised their family in Bridgetown, Barbados, where Rihanna lived until she was 16 years old. The pair separated when the ""Love on the Brain"" musician was young, and they officially divorced in 2002, when Rihanna was 14. Rihanna's has been candid about her relationship with her father over the years, and spoke out against her father after she was assaulted by her then-boyfriend Chris Brown in 2009 and Fenty reportedly spoke to the press about the incident without his daughter's consent. ""You grow up with your father, you know him, you are a part of him, for goodness' sakes!"" she said, per Billboard. ""And then he does something so bizarre that I can't begin to wrap my mind around it."" The following year, Rihanna shared during a TV appearance alongside Oprah that she had ""repaired"" her relationship with her father. The PEOPLE App is now available in the Apple App Store! Download it now for the most binge-worthy celeb content, exclusive video clips, astrology updates and more! ""He taught me everything, and as awful as he was to my mom, at times, it didn't compare to how great he was as a father,"" she said of her dad. ""And I had to come to terms with that, and I was able to close that gap with him.” The pair later became involved in a lawsuit in 2019, when Rihanna sued her father for allegedly exploiting her name for financial gain by starting a talent development company in 2017 called Fenty Entertainment, posing as her manager to solicit new clients. Three weeks before the case went to trial in 2021, Rihanna filed to dismiss the lawsuit, according to the BBC.

With her latest achievement, she cements her place in streaming history — all while balancing family life and business ventures. <h3>A Record-Breaking Streaming Milestone</h3> On Wednesday, <strong>Chart Data</strong> confirmed a historic achievement for Rihanna. The global superstar has now officially surpassed <strong>50 billion streams</strong> on <strong>Spotify</strong>, making her the <strong>first Black female artist in history</strong> to hit that milestone on the platform. This number includes both her <strong>solo catalog</strong> and <strong>collaborative features</strong>, which span more than 15 years of chart-dominating music. From early hits like <em>“Umbrella”</em> and <em>“Take a Bow”</em> to streaming-era smashes like <em>“Work”</em> and <em>“Needed Me,”</em> Rihanna's impact continues to resonate, even in her extended absence from regular releases. <blockquote> With this feat, Rihanna joins an elite circle of artists, male or female, who have crossed the 50 billion threshold — and she's done it without releasing a studio album since 2016. </blockquote> <h3>The Legacy of <em>Anti</em></h3> Rihanna's last full-length album, <em><strong>Anti</strong></em>, dropped in <strong>January 2016</strong>, and remains a modern classic. The album featured a bold, genre-blending sound, critical acclaim, and massive streaming success. Standout tracks included: <ul><li><em>“Work”</em> featuring Drake (which spent nine weeks at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100)</li><li><em>“Needed Me”</em></li><li><em>“Love on the Brain”</em></li><li><em>“Kiss It Better”</em></li></ul> Despite being nearly a decade old, <em>Anti</em> has remained a <strong>streaming juggernaut</strong>, and continues to attract new listeners on platforms like Spotify and Apple Music. As of mid-2025, <em>Anti</em> still sits among the most-streamed R&B albums by a female artist. Rihanna has released <strong>a few songs since then</strong>, including her 2022 comeback ballad <em>“Lift Me Up”</em> from <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em> — which earned an Oscar nomination — and most recently, <em>“Friend of Mine”</em> from the <strong>Smurfs movie soundtrack</strong>, released in <strong>May 2025</strong>. <h3>“Friend of Mine” – A Taste of Rih in 2025</h3> While not a traditional single or part of a larger project, <em>“Friend of Mine”</em> reminded fans of what they've been missing: Rihanna's unmistakable voice and emotional delivery. The track, a playful and family-friendly tune featured on the <strong>Smurfs soundtrack</strong>, gave younger audiences a taste of Rihanna's range and introduced her voice to a new generation. The release was warmly received and sparked <strong>renewed hope</strong> among fans that new material — possibly even an album — is finally on the way. <h3>A New Era of Rihanna: Music, Motherhood & Empire Building</h3> In the past three years, Rihanna's life has taken a major turn — or several. She has become a <strong>mother of three</strong>, welcoming children with her longtime partner, <strong>A$AP Rocky</strong>, between 2022 and 2025. The couple has embraced family life, occasionally offering the public sweet glimpses of their kids while maintaining a degree of privacy. Balancing motherhood with global fame isn't easy, but Rihanna has done so with elegance and determination — all while continuing to run her <strong>Fenty empire</strong>, which includes: <ul><li><strong>Fenty Beauty</strong>, her billion-dollar cosmetics brand</li><li><strong>Savage X Fenty</strong>, her inclusive lingerie line</li><li><strong>Fenty Skin</strong>, her skincare label</li><li>Ongoing work in <strong>fashion, fragrance</strong>, and entertainment partnerships</li></ul> <blockquote> Rihanna is now just as known for <strong>boardrooms as she is for billboards</strong>, redefining what it means to be a pop star in the 2020s. </blockquote> <h3>Still Waiting for “R9”</h3> Despite her other ventures and the joys of motherhood, fans are still holding out hope for Rihanna's long-awaited ninth studio album — dubbed <em><strong>“R9”</strong></em> by her devoted Navy fanbase. In countless interviews over the years, Rihanna has teased the project — sometimes playfully, sometimes seriously. At one point, she even joked that fans would “not be ready” for the new sound she's been experimenting with, which reportedly leans heavily into <strong>Caribbean and dancehall influences</strong>. Yet, as the years go by, the album has remained elusive. Still, the excitement surrounding any hint of new music never dies down. The release of “Friend of Mine” and her appearance on the 2023 Super Bowl Halftime Show only intensified speculation that <strong><em>R9</em> could finally be on the horizon</strong>. <h3>Why Rihanna's 50 Billion Stream Milestone Matters</h3> Streaming platforms have dramatically reshaped the music industry over the last decade. In an era where algorithms and playlist placements drive discovery, reaching <strong>50 billion streams</strong> isn't just about popularity — it's about <strong>cultural staying power</strong>. Rihanna's milestone matters because: <ul><li>She hasn't released a studio album in <strong>nine years</strong></li><li>She has maintained massive global streaming numbers despite being relatively inactive musically</li><li>She is the <strong>first Black female artist</strong> to hit this number — a groundbreaking achievement in an industry where Black women have long faced barriers in both visibility and equity</li></ul> This achievement places Rihanna in the same league as streaming powerhouses like <strong>Drake</strong>, <strong>The Weeknd</strong>, <strong>Bad Bunny</strong>, and <strong>Taylor Swift</strong> — all of whom have either released multiple recent projects or remained heavily active in the touring and music release space. <h3>Social Media Reactions & Fan Love</h3> Fans around the world took to social media to celebrate Rihanna's historic milestone. Hashtags like <strong>#Rihanna50Billion</strong>, <strong>#R9When</strong>, and <strong>#TheNavy</strong> quickly trended on platforms like Twitter (X) and Instagram. Many users praised Rihanna for “dominating without even trying,” while others joked that she needs to “drop the album already.” Whether or not <em>R9</em> arrives this year, Rihanna's place in music history is already secured...."
mov_E3E5C45B64D82A82DB3AF3EFCD618AEB,2025-06-27 04:34:48,en,WEB,"  The Passing of Ronald Fenty: A Look at Rihanna's Father and His Battle with Illness Ronald Fenty, the father of global music icon Rihanna, recently passed away at the age of 74. While news of his death initially surfaced in late july 2023, the specific cause has now been revealed as a prolonged struggle with Parkinson's disease. this loss marks a significant moment for the artist and prompts a broader conversation about the impact of neurodegenerative diseases on families and the challenges faced by those living with them. A Life Behind the Spotlight ronald fenty was born in Barbados and later moved too the United States. He managed Rihanna during the early stages of her career, playing a role in securing her initial audition with Jay-Z. While their relationship experienced periods of strain, particularly as Rihanna rose to international fame, the bond between father and daughter remained complex and, ultimately, significant. He often spoke publicly about his pride in Rihanna's accomplishments, even as he navigated his own personal struggles. Recent reports indicate that Fenty had been battling Parkinson's disease for several years, a condition that progressively affects movement. Parkinson's disease affects nearly one million Americans, and the number is expected to rise to 1.2 million by 2030, according to the Parkinson's Foundation. The disease impacts dopamine-producing neurons in the brain, leading to tremors, rigidity, slow movement, and postural instability. The Impact of Parkinson's Disease on Families The revelation of Parkinson's disease as the cause of Mr. Fenty's death shines a light on the often-hidden burdens faced by families dealing with chronic illness. Beyond the physical challenges experienced by the individual, the disease places a substantial emotional, financial, and logistical strain on loved ones. Caregiving responsibilities can be all-consuming, often requiring significant lifestyle adjustments and potentially impacting careers and personal well-being. Consider the analogy of a complex machine; when one vital component begins to fail, the entire system requires recalibration and constant maintenance. Similarly, a Parkinson's diagnosis necessitates a complete restructuring of family dynamics and routines. Support groups and professional care are often essential resources for navigating thes challenges.The Parkinson's Foundation estimates that the average cost of Parkinson's care can exceed $25,000 per year, highlighting the significant financial burden. A Complex Relationship and Lasting Legacy Rihanna and her father's relationship was often characterized by its ups and downs. Public disagreements, particularly surrounding business matters, were reported in the media. However, despite these challenges, Rihanna maintained contact with her father and provided support during his illness. Ronald Fenty's legacy extends beyond his connection to his famous daughter. He represents the countless individuals who navigate life with quite dignity in the face of adversity.His story serves as a poignant reminder of the importance of family, the challenges of chronic illness, and the need for greater awareness and support for those affected by Parkinson's disease and other neurodegenerative conditions.Okay, here's a rewritten version of the article content you provided, aiming for 100% uniqueness while maintaining quality, meaning, and a coherent structure.

Rihanna Mourns Father's Passing Amidst Professional Commitments The global music and beauty icon, Rihanna, is navigating a period of profound personal loss following the death of her father, ronald Fenty. while details surrounding his passing were initially limited, it has now been confirmed that he succumbed to a battle with illness.This news comes as Rihanna continues to build her expanding business empire, most recently with the launch of her highly anticipated Fenty Hair line. A father-Daughter Bond & Recent Struggles Ronald Fenty, a Barbadian native, played a significant role in Rihanna's early life, reportedly encouraging her musical talents and supporting her ambitions. While their relationship experienced periods of complexity, as is common in many families, Rihanna often spoke fondly of her father's influence. Sources close to the singer reveal that his declining health had been a source of considerable distress for her in recent months. according to the National alliance on Mental Illness, grief can manifest in a variety of ways, including emotional numbness, difficulty concentrating, and changes in appetite or sleep patterns. It's understandable that Rihanna would attempt to maintain a sense of normalcy through her work, even while privately processing such a significant loss. The pressure of maintaining a public persona while grieving is a challenge faced by many high-profile individuals. Balancing Grief and Business: The fenty Hair Launch Despite the emotional weight of her father's death, Rihanna recently made a public appearance at the launch of Fenty Hair. The event,a showcase of her latest venture into the beauty industry,was met with considerable excitement from fans and industry professionals alike. Observers noted that while Rihanna presented a composed front,an insider shared that she was experiencing a deeply emotional rollercoaster.

mov_D439F307360A5D6A67B1E365B309D144,2025-06-27 11:10:32,en,WEB,"  In the rapidly evolving world of online marketing, TikTok has emerged as a groundbreaking platform upon which businesses are able to achieve unprecedented visibility through calculated appearances on highlights and viral videos. The content delivery mechanism on the platform through an algorithm opens avenues of opportunity for businesses to reach colossal numbers of individuals organically, revolutionizing traditional forms of advertising and setting new benchmarks for actual brand interaction. Entertainment and Sports Brands Take the Lead Sporting goods brands and media companies have been extremely good at using the virality of TikTok. Nike is seen often in fitness do-it-yourself makeover clips, dance challenges, and sports achievement series seamlessly integrating their brands into user-generated material without feeling too corporate. The gaming sector has also taken notice of this potential, with sites such as MelBet positioning themselves strategically in sporting material and game discussion to reach interested clients which engagement-only participate in sports betting and casino gaming. Disney's strategy paves the way for advanced content strategy, having their brand portrayed in film reaction videos, theme park engagement, and vintage content outside demographic niches. The triumph of the entertainment business is because of the understanding that TikTok favors real storytelling over traditional marketing methods. Such brands know that coercive product placements tend to fail primarily, while natural inclusion in engaging stories increases engagement and conversion rates way beyond traditional marketing methods. Overwhelming Organic Integration: Technological Giants Apple, Samsung, and other tech companies have mastered the art of making an appearance on TikTok videos without explicitly advertising their products. Their products appear in innovative videos, tutorials, and lifestyle videos that rack up millions of impressions through sheer product placement that never feels artificial. Game studios are another group finding resounding success on the platform. Epic Games, Riot Games, and mobile game studios are staples in gameplay clips, reaction videos, and community challenges. Those staples habitually earn more engagement than typical ad campaigns through their utilization of the genuine excitement of gaming communities. The key to success for the tech sector is understanding that users of TikTok are watching for entertainment first, and for advertising messages second. It's successful technology brands that focus on enabling creativity rather than pushing sales messages, and this translates into higher engagement rates and greater brand affinity with younger viewers. Fashion and Beauty Brands Sweeping Viral Content The beauty and fashion industries have witnessed unprecedented growth through TikTok features, with Rare Beauty, Fenty Beauty, and Glossier emerging as household brands due to mostly viral videos and consumer reviews. These brands have excelled at product exposure rather than virtual user experience. Some of the reasons behind fashion and beauty brand success on TikTok are: Transformation Content: Fashion style and makeup tips vlogs merely demonstrate products in a way that truly creates value for a viewer User-Generated Reviews: Real product reviews and “get ready with me” vlogs build trust and influence purchasing more than traditional advertising does Participation in Trends: Fashion brands that rapidly respond to emerging trends and challenges stay in the game and current in the platform's high-speed culture Influencer Collaborations: Strategic influencer partnerships involving macro and micro-influencers enable reach extension with preservation of authenticity The specific value of the beauty market on TikTok is the visual format of its content. Transformative videos, before-and-after, and tutorial content all lend themselves easily to demonstrations of products and thus offer strong incentives for viewers to watch and share branded content. These brands have also been beautifully in tune with trending sounds, hashtags, and cultural happenings, remaining current in content within the ever-changing world of TikTok. Food and Beverage Industry's Viral Recipe Revolution Quick-serve restaurants and beverage brands are finding recipe videos, hacks, and taste tests generating incredible action on TikTok. Starbucks, Chipotle, and other energy drink manufacturers continue to crop up in user-generated content, as consumers feature innovative ways of using the brands. The success in the food industry shows the strength of functional content that delivers value to consumers instantaneously. Recipe modifications, secret menus, and cooking tips become irresistible motivations for consumers to use brand content while, at the same time, driving traffic and revenue.

The guest list read like a who's who of entertainment, business, and fashion, drawing notable media attention and sparking widespread public interest. The Elite Attendees: A Glimpse into the Guest Roster The event attracted a dazzling array of prominent figures. Among those spotted enjoying the Venetian festivities were members of the kardashian-jenner family – Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and matriarch Kris Jenner.Adding to the star power were Ivanka Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, alongside Hollywood heavyweights like Orlando Bloom and Leonardo DiCaprio. The presence of supermodel Vittoria Ceretti and media mogul Oprah Winfrey further solidified the event's status as a truly exceptional occasion.This level of celebrity attendance isn't unusual for high-profile weddings,but the sheer concentration of influential individuals in Venice was remarkable.According to a recent report by Statista, celebrity endorsements and appearances can increase brand awareness by up to 32%, demonstrating the significant impact these figures have on public perception – and the allure they bring to exclusive events. Jenner Sisters Grace Venice with Their Presence Kendall and Kylie Jenner made a striking impression upon their arrival in Venice.Kendall opted for a flowing floral dress, while Kylie showcased a meticulously detailed ensemble. Both sisters embraced a relaxed aesthetic,sporting loose,wind-swept hairstyles that perfectly complemented the romantic atmosphere of the city. Their arrival generated considerable buzz on social media, with fans eagerly sharing photos and videos. The sisters' influence extends far beyond the entertainment world; Kylie Jenner's cosmetics company, Kylie Cosmetics, is estimated to be worth over $1.2 billion (Forbes, 2024), highlighting their significant economic impact and the attention they command. Kardashian-Jenner Family Affair: A United Front The presence of Kim kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, and Kris Jenner alongside Kendall and Kylie underscored the family's close bond and their collective influence. the Kardashian-Jenner clan has become synonymous with modern celebrity culture, leveraging social media and strategic branding to build a multi-billion dollar empire. Their coordinated appearances at the wedding served as a powerful reminder of their brand strength. Much like the British Royal Family, the Kardashians have cultivated a carefully managed public image, and events like Bezos' wedding provide valuable opportunities to reinforce that image and maintain their relevance in the ever-evolving media landscape. [Image of Kendall Jenner and Kylie Jenner in Venice – ernesto Ruscio/] (Image caption: Kendall Jenner and kylie jenner) The wedding served as a captivating spectacle, blending the personal celebration of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez with the undeniable magnetism of its star-studded guest list. The event's impact will likely resonate for some time, continuing to fuel conversations about celebrity culture, wealth, and the enduring allure of venice. Kim Kardashian's Evolving Style: A Masterclass in trendsetting and Personal Branding Kim Kardashian has long been a figurehead in popular culture, but her influence extends far beyond reality television. A significant component of her enduring appeal lies in her consistently evolving and highly publicized style. Recent appearances, like those alongside her mother Kris Jenner, offer a compelling snapshot of her current aesthetic – a blend of high fashion, comfort, and a calculated approach to image management. Deconstructing the “Effortless” Look Kardashian's recent style choices, often described as deliberately “undone,” are anything but accidental. the combination of animal-print footwear, a revealing dress softened by an oversized sweatshirt, statement sunglasses, and a sleek, face-framing high bun is a carefully constructed statement. This isn't simply about following trends; it's about setting them. Consider the current landscape of fashion. According to a recent report by edited, a retail technology company, searches for “sweatshirt dresses” increased by 45% in the last quarter of 2023, mirroring a broader trend towards comfort-focused luxury. Kardashian's adoption of this style, however, elevates it. The juxtaposition of the casual sweatshirt with a more daring dress creates a dynamic tension, signaling both accessibility and exclusivity. It's a look that says, “I can be relatable, but I'm still Kim kardashian.” the Power of Accessories and Silhouette The accessories play a crucial role in completing the look. The oversized sunglasses aren't just a shield from the paparazzi; they're a power statement, evoking the glamour of Old Hollywood icons like Jackie Kennedy Onassis. Similarly, the high chignon isn't merely a hairstyle; it draws attention to her face, emphasizing her features and creating a polished, sophisticated impression. This focus on silhouette is a hallmark of Kardashian's style. She consistently utilizes clothing to sculpt and define her figure, a strategy that has become incredibly influential.A 2022 study by the Fashion Institute of Technology found that Kardashian's body-conscious style has considerably impacted consumer preferences for shapewear and form-fitting garments, driving a $4.6 billion industry. Beyond Fashion: Style as a Business strategy Kim Kardashian's style isn't just about aesthetics; it's inextricably linked to her business ventures.Her shapewear brand, SKIMS, directly benefits from her consistent showcasing of figure-hugging silhouettes. Her beauty line, KKW Beauty, is often promoted through carefully curated makeup looks that are then replicated by fans and beauty influencers. This integrated approach – where personal style fuels brand identity and drives sales – is a masterclass in modern entrepreneurship. It's a strategy that's been adopted by othre celebrities,like Rihanna with Fenty Beauty,but Kardashian arguably pioneered this level of seamless integration. The Future of Kim's Style looking ahead, it's likely that Kim Kardashian will continue to push boundaries and redefine trends. Her ability to anticipate and capitalize on cultural shifts, combined with her keen understanding of personal branding, ensures that her style will remain a subject of interest and influence for years to come. She's not just wearing clothes; she's building an empire, one carefully curated outfit at a time. (Image Credit: Andrea cremascoli // )..."

Pour recevoir des nouvelles et des informations quotidiennes, abonnez-vous à notre journal gratuit Newsletter des médias sociaux aujourd'hui. Tiktok veut vraiment, vraiment que vous achetiez des choses dans l'application, c'est pourquoi elle héberge un flux de promotions de shopping apparemment en cours, avec sa poussée actuelle axée sur les petites entreprises et les options d'achat pour la nourriture dans l'application, qui sera donc suivie d'un autre événement de vente tout au long de juillet. Tout d'abord, au cours de la semaine suivante, Tiktok coure vers Promotion “acheter localement”ce sera “Célébrez les gens, les histoires et les communautés derrière les petites entreprises les plus distinctives d'Amérique. “ Tiktok est super enthousiaste met en évidence sa contribution à l'économie américaineEt attachez-le à sa poussée de shopping plus large, ressemble à un excellent véhicule pour sa poussée pour la conscience des achats prolongés. Comme expliqué par Tiktok: “SHOWNLOGAMYMADE fait partie de notre engagement à soutenir l'impact social par le commerce – cette fois en s'appuyant sur la valeur culturelle et économique des entreprises locales avec des racines régionales profondes. La campagne présentera des vendeurs exceptionnels de petites entreprises de tous les États-Unis, chacun avec un lien unique avec sa propre communauté et un record réussi à succès dans la boutique Tiktok. “ La campagne se concentrera pour la première fois sur Seattle et sur le célèbre marché des poissons de Pike Place, afin de promouvoir l'expansion de Tiktok dans les produits alimentaires à vendre en flux. «Les clients peuvent désormais découvrir et acheter un assortiment croissant de produits frais et surgelés, notamment des articles à pâtisserie, des repas préparés, du fromage et du salami, de la viande et des fruits de la mer et des boissons. Le marché de la pêche – connu pour sa gestion des poissons experts, qui apporte du poisson non pour le théâtre et la base de poisson non pour le théâtre et la base de poisson et la base de poisson et la base de poisson et de théâtre et de base La base du poisson et non pour le théâtre et la base du poisson et non pour le théâtre et la base du poisson et non pour le théâtre et la base des poissons de théâtre et la base du pathogène l'application. Je veux dire, je ne sais pas que j'aurais personnellement voulu commander des fruits de mer sur Tiktok, mais Tiktok dit que cela marque le début d'un coup de pouce national pour mettre en évidence les favoris de la nourriture locale et régionale, “aidant à apporter une dégustation à la maison à travers l'Amérique”. La transition vers la nourriture est logique, conformément à la façon dont Tiktok essaie d'évoluer ses options d'achat de câbles, même si je m'attendais à ce que la livraison de nourriture soit au centre de cet égard, pas de la nourriture. En Chine, la version locale de Tiktok Il propose déjà des services de commande et de livraison de nourritureélargir ses options d'achat dans le stam. En tant que tel, il semblait inévitable que Tiktok ait suivi l'exemple, alors qu'il essaie d'obtenir plus d'argent qui traverse ses circuits. Cependant, vraisemblablement, il existe des limites de livraison importantes sur les commandes de fruits de mer frais. Dans tous les cas, la campagne mettra en évidence davantage d'options d'achat locales dans l'application, dans le but de susciter plus d'intérêt, car Tiktok continue de pousser ses options d'achat sur plusieurs utilisateurs. Sa prochaine poussée des ventes est dans un territoire plus familier, avec Tiktok qui gère également un Événement “Offres pour vous” de 13 jours Du 7 au 19 juillet. «Les acheteurs peuvent trouver une excellente sélection des principales marques nationales telles que Briogeo, par nature de la peau, The Heritage Store, Pacsun, Fenty Beauty, Crocs, Liquid IV, Philips, Et plus. Les clients appropriés peuvent utiliser Ven le paiement pour échanger une remise supplémentaire. “ La promotion se poursuivra devant les ventes d'Amazon, comme moyen de s'accrocher à l'augmentation de l'intérêt de l'acheteur pour la période, Tiktok essayant de se concentrer spécifiquement sur les opportunités d'achat en direct dans l'application. En fait, le lancement de Tiktok est également lancé “Match de match de prix en direct“Programme, qui offrira aux clients qui consultent les offres sélectionnées pour vos jours de dos pour la différence s'ils trouvent un prix plus bas sur la plate-forme sur les produits au premier plan. Le shopping en direct était un autre élément clé de la poussée du shopping de Tiktok en Chine et espère attirer plus d'attention que le public pour cela comptez sur ses entrées aux revenus. Et ces opportunités pourraient être importantes. Génère la version chinoise de Tiktok (appelé “Douyin”) 490 milliards de dollars de ventes de produits bruts (GMV) en 2024une augmentation de 30% sur une base annuelle. Selon les rapports, Tiktok a généré 30 milliards de dollars en GMV en 2024Vous pouvez donc comprendre pourquoi Team Tiktok est de plus en plus désireux de se concentrer sur cet élément. Et bien que les achats dans l'application n'aient pas encore pris les pieds à Tiktok de la même manière, il y a des signes que les utilisateurs de Tiktok Ils s'intéressent de plus en plus à ses options d'achat. Au début de cette année, Tiktok a rapporté Que Les ventes des magasins Tiktok aux États-Unis ont augmenté de 120% par rapport à la même période l'année dernière, tandis que Les marques et les créateurs ont également accueilli plus de 8 millions d'heures de séances de magasinage en direct aux États-Unis Les ventes de petites entreprises américaines dans l'application ont augmenté de 70% sur une base annuelle et, en combinaison, vous pouvez comprendre pourquoi les managers de Tiktok se concentrent toujours sur les signes du dollar tout en recherchant plus de moyens de pousser ses options d'achat intégrées. Il reste à voir si Tiktok deviendra jamais un méga-hub pour faire du shopping, comme il l'a fait en Chine, mais avec des centaines de milliards potentiellement en jeu, vous pouvez parier que Tiktok fera un grand coup. Et vite, comme ça pourrait encore En fin de compte, être interdit aux États-Unis."

mov_F4B5B8543CB34C8AB29B72ECA9E19296,2025-07-03 07:39:13,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]La tendencia de “maquillaje sin maquillaje” sigue fuerte, pero con un giro: ahora no solo queremos lucir frescas, también estructuradas. Y para lograrlo sin 17 productos ni gastar una fortuna, entra en escena Rimmel London Sculpting Palette, una joya low cost con tres tonos que trabajan en sinergia: bronceador, iluminador y colorete, todo en un compacto que cabe en cualquier bolso y cuesta apenas 6 euros. ¿Lo mejor? No es una paleta cualquiera. Fue desarrollada junto a Kate Moss, quien aporta ese toque cool británico a una fórmula práctica y efectiva. La promesa de la paleta es clara: esculpir, iluminar y dar color al rostro con naturalidad. Pero en la práctica, también ofrece versatilidad total: El bronceador es de tono neutro, sin subtono naranja, ideal para contorno sutil o efecto sunkissed. El iluminador tiene destello fino, nada glitter, que aporta ese glow elegante estilo Hailey Bieber. El rubor es rosa-melocotón universal, favorecedor en todo tipo de pieles, que da ese toque de vitalidad instantánea. Además, su textura sedosa y modulable permite trabajar las capas sin dejar manchones ni exceso de polvo. Se difumina fácil con brocha, esponja o incluso con los dedos si estás fuera de casa. Rimmel no es nuevo en el juego, pero esta paleta lleva meses en los primeros puestos de ventas de Amazon y es protagonista de muchos tutoriales en TikTok y YouTube. ¿La razón? Hace el trabajo de tres productos de lujo en un solo gesto. Muchas influencers la comparan con: La Filmstar Bronze & Glow de Charlotte Tilbury (pero 40 euros más barata). El Dior Backstage Glow Face Palette, por su efecto de segunda piel. O incluso con Fenty Beauty, en cuanto a practicidad y pigmentación. Además, en un contexto donde buscamos optimizar rutinas y espacio (bye neceser gigante), una paleta todo en uno tiene un valor emocional: es eficiente, compacta y libre de complicaciones. Por 6 euros, la Rimmel Sculpting Palette ofrece calidad, practicidad y versatilidad. Perfecta para principiantes, minimalistas, chicas que viajan o quienes buscan un glow con poco esfuerzo. No sustituye a productos de gama alta en textura extrema o larga duración tipo red carpet, pero para el día a día y looks de oficina o citas, es más que suficiente. Además, es un recordatorio de que el buen maquillaje no tiene por qué costar una fortuna. Porque al final, el estilo es lo que haces con lo que tienes, no lo que cuesta. @mundistyle"
353ffb64eee683bc3c4823c67a422e48,2025-07-03 12:34:00,en,WEB,"  The Black Beauty market is exhibiting robust expansion driven by increasing consumer demand for inclusive and culturally resonant cosmetic and personal care products.

Black Beauty Market Forecast indicates strong market opportunities fueled by rising awareness, product innovation, and expanded retail penetration. The market report highlights an escalating market revenue trajectory driven by the increasing demand for specialty skincare, cosmetics, and hair care products that address unique needs within the Black community. Impact of Geopolitical Situation on Supply Chain A notable real-world example is the US-China trade tariffs implemented in late 2024, which disrupted the supply of essential botanical extracts and synthetic ingredients vital to Black beauty formulations.

In 2024, several of these market companies strengthened technology partnerships focusing on AI-based product personalization, resulting in a measurable 8% increase in market revenue. Additionally, investments in sustainable ingredient sourcing by Estée Lauder and Unilever have improved their market share and fortified their competitive advantage in the Black beauty market.

tw_sl_5da78be4f42c33a255d7d0bcf2f0f026,2025-07-03 13:57:52,en,WEB,"  C elebrities ARE venturing beyond the billboard and the big screen—and into big business. Hailey Bieber, a model married to Justin, recently sold Rhode, her make-up brand, in a deal valued at as much as $1bn. Skims, a shapewear label founded by Kim Kardashian, a reality- TV star, makes $1bn in annual sales and is expected to list on the stockmarket soon. Rihanna is now a billionaire not directly because of her music, but thanks to Fenty Beauty, her make-up label. Ryan Reynolds, a Hollywood actor, is active in everything from telecoms to online privacy. Surprisingly, many of these superstar businesses have become a source of innovative new consumer products. Celebrities have long used their fame to peddle things. Michael Jordan, a basketball player, is thought to have made over $1.5bn from his partnership with Nike over the past 40 years. Nespresso has reportedly paid George Clooney more than $40m to have his mug selling its coffee. Two decades ago Hulk Hogan, a professional wrestler, helped market the “Hulkster” cheeseburger, pre-cooked and frozen for your convenience. The practice continues. This week President Donald Trump launched “Victory 45-47”, a line of fragrances for men and women priced at $249, having launched “Fight Fight Fight” ($199) last year. By contrast, the new superstar brands put the A -list into capitalist. Ms Bieber and co are involved in operations and hold equity stakes of varying sizes in the underlying businesses. Many celebs have begun to rethink the value of traditional endorsement and licensing deals. Social media now give them a line straight to their fans. Direct-to-consumer distribution, meanwhile, has made getting a product to market easier than ever. Given that the real money is in building and owning a brand , rather than advertising, why not launch one instead? This thinking in turn is altering the life-cycle of consumer goods. Just as pharmaceutical giants acquire biotech startups to refresh their drug pipelines, so consumer giants are buying up the most successful celebrity brands. The match makes sense. The hardest part of building a brand is the first 100,000 sales, but the A -list has a fan base that is well disposed towards them and their wares. Once a celebrity brand gets off the ground, a consumer giant has the production and distribution networks to help it grow. Hence the series of deals. Among the first was Apple's acquisition of Beats Electronics, a headphones and streaming business co-founded by Dr Dre, a music producer. Many were shocked when the tech giant, which prides itself on in-house research and design, paid around $3bn for the brand in 2014. More recently Diageo, a drinksmaker, has bought a tequila firm co-owned by Mr Clooney, in a deal valued at around $1bn, and a gin distiller partly owned by Mr Reynolds, for up to $610m. Obviously, a famous name is not enough on its own to get a second-rate product flying off the shelves. You need only peer into the bargain bin in any cosmetics shop to spot the remainders of Rosie Huntington-Whiteley's beauty products, or Sarah Jessica Parker's scents. Some of Mr Trump's newest offerings may soon join them. According to a perfume-review website, Victory 45-47 for men is “not particularly memorable”. Shoppers today are quick to review products on social media. Fans might try a new lipstick or t -shirt produced by a celebrity. But they will not buy it a second time if they are disappointed. At their best, celebrity brands are innovative, creative—and lucrative for their owners. Yet, just like show business, brutal flops are possible, too. ■ Subscribers to The Economist can sign up to our Opinion newsletter , which brings together the best of our leaders, columns, guest essays and reader correspondence.

mov_3ED9A9E701ED3AB8C1B794E7F1056A68,2025-07-06 13:31:03,en,WEB,"  Reviewers are calling this products ""wizardry,"" ""sorcery,"" ""magic,"" ""witchery,"" and even made with ""pixie dust"" — so you *know* they're good. 1. A Turmeric Overnight Wrapping Peel Off Mask (from viral K-Beauty brand Medicube) — it's packed with vitamin C, kojic acid and collagen, plus the namesake turmeric, to brighten and even your skin tone...all while you get a solid night of beauty sleep. And maybe the best part: you get to peeeeeeeel it off in the morning; very satisfying. The term ""morning shed"" just got...quite literal. Promising review: ""This is magic in a bottle, after one night more then half the giant pores on my checks close to my nose have disappeared. My face is so soft, like softer than a baby's bum fr. Was not uncomfortable to sleep in! Stayed put all night. I'm seriously blown away by this product. I'm seriously kicking myself for not taking a before photo. I also purchased their exfoliating BHA pads and i recommend those as well."" —Realthought Promising review: ""Bought this on a fluke; I was purchasing the collagen one by the same company. I loooove this one!!!! . My skin was more hydrated with this, saw my skin tone even out, and the texture of my skin improved. Easy to use, dries down well so as not to stick to anything when you go to bed. Peels off easy as well. No weird smell. I swear by it."" —Byinnah Jones Get it from Amazon for $19. Medicube makes a regular-degular collagen version too for elasticity and firming — you can get it for $14.65. 2. RoC Multi Correxion Revive + Glow Vitamin C Eye Balm — it's going viral for how well it moisturizes the under-eyes, especially before concealer to prevent cakiness or settling into fine lines. Plus, the skincare ingredients (the namesake vitamin C and peptides) can help brighten and firm the delicate skin under your eyes. And you can't beat the easy-to-apply stick — just swipe it on! Check it out on TikTok here. Promising review: ""It's been a game-changer for my undereye area! My undereyes used to get dry and cakey when I applied concealer, but since I started using this eye balm beforehand, my concealer goes on so much smoother. It really helps hydrate and prep the skin, and the results are noticeable! What's also great is that if I experience any dry patches throughout the day, I can apply it over my makeup without disrupting it. I'm loving how it gives my undereyes a refreshed, glowing look. Highly recommend this if you're looking for a hydrating and effective eye balm!"" —Mackenzie Promising review: ""Magic in a tube! On days when my under-eyes are a little dry and my concealer is starting to look cakey, this stuff is amazing. It's super moisturizing, lightweight, and easy to apply. Just swipe, tap in, and your concealer will go on super smooth."" —Jennifer Get it from Amazon for $28.05. 3. Stila's Stay All Day liquid eyeliner with a smudge-free felt tip that makes creating the perfect cat eye simpler than ever. While it may not be a magic wand, it does have a long-lasting formula reviewers love that doesn't bleed, crack, or budge (as the name suggests) alllllll day. Promising review: ""HG eyeliner of all time! Cannot live without this eyeliner. I don't know what wizardry is involved in making this eyeliner — it lasts forever and doesn't smudge. One pen will last months! I will never be without this liner!""..."

tw_sl_b6e15685b8620f55b3ae75c177d49f6f,2025-07-08 12:05:23,en,WEB,"  Remember when celebrity endorsements meant awkward TV ads with stars clutching products they'd probably never use? Those days are long gone. Today's star entrepreneurs aren't just lending their names to existing products; they're building real brands from scratch, and some are absolutely smashing it (in line with the best rebrands). Because while fame gets a brand noticed, what keeps people coming back is authentic storytelling, smart positioning, and understanding what your audience wants. And that's something we can all learn from. So let's dive into what's working and why. 01. Rihanna: Fenty Beauty Barbadian singer Rihanna (real name Robyn Rihanna Fenty) is one of the wealthiest and best-selling musicians of all time, with estimated sales of 250 million records, as well as being a successful actor. In 2017 she launched Fenty Beauty, and it's now a billion-dollar business. Even more importantly, it's has forced the beauty industry to up their inclusivity game. Rihanna had a strong sense of what was wrong with beauty and wasn't afraid to fix it. As Hsu-Ying Fullick, executive creative director at Landor, explains: ""Her tag line of 'beauty for all' was reflected in the debut of 40 foundation shades. She mandated that retailers stock the full range, refusing to allow her brand to be limited to lighter, more popular tones. This genuine commitment to diversity made waves, ensuring the brand was seen, noticed and celebrated."" ""Fenty didn't just sell makeup,"" he concludes. ""It sold a story that people could support. I also admired how the packaging was simple and clean, using sleek, minimal colours and graphics that supported rather than overpowered Rihanna's vision."" Daily design news, reviews, how-tos and more, as picked by the editors. ""There are many 'celebrity brands' where the famous face is simply an ambassador,"" adds Fura Johannesdottir, global CCO at Interbrand. ""Fenty Beauty could not be more different. It's Rihanna's brand vision with a strong purpose and she seems heavily involved."" And it's had a huge impact. ""Fenty Beauty changed the game in the beauty category by solving a real issue: the lack of inclusive makeup for all skin tones,"" Fura explains. ""Its darkest shade of foundation sold out almost immediately after the launch; clearly there was a real need for it."" Many celeb brands feel fake or performative. ""But Fenty still feels fresh due to its personality and genuineness,"" says Hsu-Ying. ""It reminds us that authenticity and purpose are the most powerful branding tools we can ever have."" 02. Jessica Alba: The Honest Company Jessica Alba made her name as an actor in TV drama Dark Angel and the Fantastic Four movies. But she's got serious business chops too. The Honest Company, which she launched in 2011, focuses on safe, eco-friendly products for babies and households. It's now pulling in record revenue of $378 million a year, reportedly making her more money than her entire Hollywood career. It's important to stress that she isn't phoning it in. ""This is not name-only endorsement,"" says Alan Young, joint CCO at St Luke's. ""Jessica Alba has been heavily involved in product development, read studies, hired scientists and experts, and spent three years developing the range before launch."" The brand positions itself as the trustworthy option in a market full of dodgy claims. As Jason Braddy, ECD at Elmwood Singapore, explains: ""It succeeded because it positioned itself as a challenger in a category filled with distrust. Jessica Alba's credibility as a parent, not just a celebrity, provides a strong and real emotional anchor that resonates with consumers. And consistency, distinctiveness, and best-in-class storytelling have all helped sell this story."" The visual branding is spot-on too, with Craig praising its simplicity and directness. ""At its heart is a roundel, locking together the Honest name and butterfly icon,"" he explains. ""This stamp of honest authority cuts through the clutter: a memorable reassurance of trust parents will keep coming back to. ""This simplicity allows the rest of the branding – cute colours and patterns – to pull products and ranges apart and complement aspirational nursery interiors."" 03. Emma Chamberlain: Chamberlain Coffee Emma Chamberlain is the YouTuber who pretty much invented the ""messy, relatable influencer"" aesthetic everyone's copying now. She has a huge Gen Z following, and a knack for making everything feel real and unfiltered. In 2019, she launched Chamberlain Coffee, and it's found a natural home in the youth market...."

mov_19EFB214706F9D35B333BDED0EA4D69C,2025-07-09 19:52:15,en,WEB,"  The best curl creams can really take your hair care routine to the next level. For the uninitiated, these are styling products that are used on coily, curly, and wavy hair types in order to create more defined curls while also addressing issues like frizz and dryness. A good curl defining cream isn't always dependent on what your hair type or curl pattern is—sometimes the best things to look for are hydrating or nourishing ingredients that seal moisture into the hair. My hair, for example, is prone to dryness, and I've noticed that my curls respond a lot better to formulas that contain key ingredients like shea butter and coconut oil. The good news is that there are dozens of options to choose from, and we spent two months incorporating several different types into our regular hair care routines, before narrowing down our favorites to the list ahead. Whether you're looking for a multitasker that hydrates and prevents breakage (like our best overall winner!) or one that perfectly defines waves for your wash and go, there's something here for every hair type and need. The best curl defining creams, at a glance: Best Overall: Pattern Beauty Styling Cream Courtesy of brand Original photo from Paton Hardy testing Pattern Beauty Styling Cream ChevronChevron Pattern Beauty Styling Cream $28 Amazon Key ingredients: Shea butter, cacay oil, almond oil Size: 15 oz. Pros: Defines curls, prevents breakage Cons: Thick and may leave residue on the hair More often than not, curl creams are looked at simply as styling products that only help with defining curly hair, but that's only partly true, since some curl creams can also address frequent issues that people with curly, wavy, and coily hair face like damage and breakage. That's where the Pattern Beauty Styling Cream comes in—it's made with ingredients like shea butter, cacay oil, and almond oil to promote length and moisture retention and to prevent breakage at the ends. So not only will it give type 3 and 4 curls a crazy amount of definition, it puts in even more work to strengthen the hair from the inside out, something not all curl creams claim to do. “The texture for this one was really thick, but it gave my curls nice definition when I applied it,” says Condé Nast Content Licensing Associate, Paton Hardy, who has very fine, curly hair. “After the fact, it was a little drying for me, so I found it best to be used with a hair oil. It also smelled super fresh!” Best Drugstore: SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie Courtesy of brand Original photo from Danielle Jackson testing SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie Original photo from Danielle Jackson testing SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie ChevronChevron SheaMoisture Coconut and Hibiscus Curl Enhancing Smoothie $12 $8 (33% off) Amazon Key ingredients: Coconut oil, silk protein Size: 12 oz. Pros: Moisturizes really well, manages frizz, under $20 Cons: It's really thick, so your hair doesn't really absorb it This is an oldie but goodie that's a SheaMoisture bestseller (it was also highly-recommended by people in my immediate friend group when I first went natural in college), and it definitely lives up to the hype. It has ingredients like coconut oil and silk protein, which moisturizes the hair from inside the shaft, and it prevents common curl woes like frizziness. Sometimes I use this cream after washing and blowing out my coily, type 4 curls (I prefer to do twist outs on stretched hair), and even after applying it to my hair in a blown out state, the curls still manage to turn out looking like healthy spirals. I'm also a really big fan of the way this product makes my hair feel—after unraveling my twists, I usually find myself continuously touching my curls because of how satisfied I am with how soft and moisturized my hair feels. My only gripe is that this is a product that sort of sits on your hair—it's pretty thick, so that's to be expected—so if you're someone who touches your hair often, you'll definitely be able to feel that there's something on your strands, though it doesn't leave behind an oily or greasy film. Best for Moisturizing: Briogeo Curl Charisma Leave-In Conditioner Courtesy of brand Original photo from Danielle Jackson testing Briogeo Curl Charisma Leave-In Conditioner Original photo from Danielle Jackson testing Briogeo Curl Charisma Leave-In Conditioner ChevronChevron Briogeo Curl Charisma Leave-In Conditioner $24 Sephora..."

Fueled by innovation, celebrity endorsements, social media influence, and shifting consumer preferences toward skincare, sustainability, and inclusivity, cosmetics brands have grown into global powerhouses. While thousands of brands exist, only a few dominate the global market in terms of brand value, reach, and consumer loyalty. Here are the top 10 most valuable cosmetics brands in the world in 2025, based on market presence, revenue, brand equity, and global influence. 1. L'Oréal (France) Estimated Brand Value: $12.5 Billion L'Oréal remains the undisputed leader in the global cosmetics industry.

Their innovation in skincare, haircare, and makeup is unmatched, and the company continues to invest heavily in research and development.

The brand has recently focused on developing sensitive skin-friendly formulations and expanding into men's grooming, increasing its reach across demographics. 4. Chanel (France) Estimated Brand Value: $6.8 Billion Chanel is the epitome of timeless luxury. Though more famous for fashion and fragrance, Chanel's cosmetics division — including foundations, lipsticks, and skincare — is among the most coveted in the world.

18101791264574156,2025-07-12 17:34:14,de,INSTAGRAM,"  Seit einer Weile teste ich den Maybelline Lifter Glaze Lip Oil Balm in der Farbe Berry Haze. Erst hatte mich das Produkt irgendwie nicht so angesprochen, aber der niedrige Preis von rund 5 Euro und der kleine aber feine Hype auf Social Media haben dafür gesorgt, dass ich das Produkt dann doch mal mitgenommen habe. Ich war neulich erst erstaunt, dass ein ähnliches Produkt von Manhattan so viel teurer war, daher finde ich 5 Euro für Maybelline echt nicht zu teuer. Das Design vom Produkt ist schlicht, gefällt mir aber schon gut. Vielleicht hätte man das Packaging noch an die Farbe des Produkts anpassen können, aber wollen wir mal keine Wunder erwarten. Das Produkt verspricht Pflege und Farbe in einem und “zart getönte Lippen”. Nun habe ich eine relativ dunkle Farbe genommen, finde aber, dass es für mich eher zur Kategorie dekorative Kosmetik als zur Kategorie Lippenpflege gehört. Oftmals sind solche Lippenpflegestifte, die auch Farbe haben, eher störend und schmierig, das ist hier nicht der Fall. Trotzdem finde ich ""zart getönte Lippen"" trifft es irgendwie gut. Ich finde, dass man bei meiner Farbe einen sehr hübschen mavig/rosanen my lips but better Look bekommt, aber auch keinen super spiegelden Glosseffekt, nicht wie zum Beispiel bei Fenty Beauty. Dafür merkt man das Produkt aber auch kaum auf den Lippen, das ist sehr angenehm. Ich merke, dass ich immer wieder zum Lifter Glaze greife und zu ""Marktforschungszwecken"" (😜) habe ich jetzt auch noch eine zweite Farbe gekauft. Ich bin mal gespannt, wie meine Meinung dort ausfallen wird, denn die Farbe ist deutlich heller. All in all bin ich ein bisschen leidenschaftslos. Das Produkt gefällt mir gut. Ich greife immer wieder dazu, auch wenn ich nun wirklich auch andere Produkte da hätte. Die Farbe gefällt mir sehr gut und passt zu den meisten Makeups. Für den Preis kann man sich das auf jeden Fall mal anschauen, ist aber für mich jetzt kein weltbewegendes must-have Produkt. Kennt ihr die Lifter Glaze Lip Balms von Maybelline? Gefallen sie euch? Welche Farben habt ihr gekauft? #maybellinelifterglaze #maybelline #neuinderdrogerie #neubeidm #neubeirossmann #beautyblogger_de #lippenstiftliebe"
1ly65yb,2025-07-12 17:34:20,en,REDDIT,"  I am 12 years old and almost a teenager. i see beauty gurus on youtube talk about charlotte tilbury and fenty lip products, what i also see on youtube are 10 year olds at sephora, and comedic parodies about how insufferable they are(i am aware that some products are harmful to children's skin barriers, and beauty standards/social media are producing a generation of insecure women). im getting pretty interested in beauty and self care and i want to get something for myself- maybe some highlighter. but im scared of being like one of those ten-years olds, technically i am in the same phase in my life as them and only 2 years older. i have always considered myself to be some what of a tomboy, and have been taught to demonize femininity. so i also have some underlying hesitation on what to get for myself. and i understand that im in a period of my life where i feel like the ugliest person alive. so if i get something, do i fall into the category of sephora kids? also-any beauty tips for sensitive skin?"
1lyhjns,2025-07-13 02:17:01,en,REDDIT,"  I've never been great at makeup and have been working hard to embrace a more natural look, and dozens of people chimed in a while ago telling me I definitely don't have a cool complexion.
