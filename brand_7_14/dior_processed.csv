There were 242 passengers and crew onboard the plane, including 169 Indian nationals, 53 Britons, seven Portuguese nationals and one Canadian. One passenger, the 40-year-old British national Vishwash Kumar Ramesh, survived the crash and was treated in hospital for injuries. Here are some of those reported to have died: Ajay Kumar Ramesh Ajay Kumar Ramesh was sitting alongside his brother, Vishwash, on the opposite side of the aisle. The brothers had been travelling home after visiting family in India. Dr Prateek Joshi, Komi Vyas and three young children; twin boys Nakul and Pradyut, aged five, and daughter, Miraya, eight Joshi, who worked at the Royal Derby hospital, is believed to have been travelling back from India, where his wife and children were based. The Derby Hindu Temple paid tribute to the family on its Facebook page, saying: “Dr Joshi [and his family] were devotees of our Mandir and supported us through their sincere service and dedication.” Neil Ryan, who lived next door to them for two years, also described them as “the nicest family”. Akeel Nanabawa, Hannaa Vorajee and their daughter, Sara, four Akeel Nanabawa, 36, lived in Gloucester. The businessman built up a recruitment company, Rec2go, before establishing Iceberg Recruitment Services. The company's head office is in Gloucester but it also has a branch in Ahmedabad, its website states. His business partner, Shoyeb Khan Nagori, told MailOnline: “I had dinner with them last night. They were a lovely family and Akeel and his wife were extremely successful people.” Vorajee, 30, a trained midwife, was the head of finance at Rec2go. In a statement paying tribute to the family, their imam, Abdullah Samad, said: “Together, [Nanabawa and Vorajee] were committed advocates for humanitarian causes – particularly the suffering of innocent Palestinians and the urgent need for accessible medical care in parts of India. “They were widely loved and deeply respected. His quiet generosity, her warmth and kindness and their daughter's bright, joyful spirit made a lasting impact on everyone who knew them.” Their neighbour Safeer Shah, 47, said the family had been on holiday in Malaysia and Indonesia before heading to the Gujarat state of India to surprise Nanabawa's father for Eid al-Adha festivities. The family had moved from Newport, south Wales, about 10 years ago. Nanabawa travelled to India regularly for business, he added. Nanabawa had three brothers who lived in the Tredworth area of Gloucestershire, as well as his mother, Shah said. “They had plans for the future,” he said. Next-door neighbours Henry and Ros Rickards, who have lived in the street for about 30 years, said the family were the best neighbours. “Sara was the loveliest girl; she loved our dog,” said Ros. “The dog never barked at her – she was so lovely. She was a gorgeous little girl.” Fiongal and Jamie Greenlaw-Meek Fiongal, 39, and Jamie Greenlaw-Meek, 45, ran the Wellness Foundry in south London and Ramsgate, Kent, a business offering psychic readings, tarot, reiki and yoga, and had partnered with major brands such as Netflix, Google and Dior. The couple married in 2022, with Jamie praising his “wonderful husband” in a Facebook post, and thanking him for “keeping me calm in times of stress (sunshine after the rain)”. He added that his heart was “so full of love and gratitude”. A former fashion designer, Fiongal founded the Wellness Foundry in late 2018 after experiencing a spiritual awakening following a mysterious illness, according to its website. His husband, a former professional dancer, joined the team in March 2023 as co-director and head of events. He also offered psychic readings and life coaching. Both were alumni of the College of Psychic Studies. The couple were returning home after a 10-day wellness retreat. The couple captured the happy time they had in India in a series of social media posts, including getting henna tattoos, shopping for fine fabrics and other gifts and driving through chaotic traffic in a tuk-tuk. They arrived in Ahmedabad just a day before flying back. Fiongal had posted in a video: “So, it's our last night in India and we've had a magical experience. Some mind-blowing things have happened. We are going to put all this together and create a vlog. It's my first ever vlog about the whole trip and we want to share it.” In the airport before takeoff, the pair filmed a video of themselves joking before the 10-hour flight back to London. Fiongal said the pair were “going back happily, happily, happily calm”. Adam and Hasina Taju and their son-in-law, Altafhusen Patel Adam Taju, 72, and his 70-year-old wife, Hasina, were flying with their son-in-law, Altafhusen Patel, 51, who lives in London with his wife.

Ia menyebut Bali sebagai contoh nyata keberhasilan UU Ekonomi Kreatif, yang sebelumnya digagas sejak ia menjabat di Komisi X DPR RI. “Bali adalah success story dari UU Ekraf. Hampir semua subsektor hidup di sini. 17 subsektor yang kita tetapkan dari fashion, kuliner, seni pertunjukan, arsitektur, desain, film, musik, hingga konten digital dan AI semuanya berkembang di Bali,” jelas Riefky.saat bertemu Gubernur Bali Wayan Koster di Jayasabha, Denpasar, Jumat (13/6). Dalam pertemuan yang berlangsung santai, keduanya membahas arah pembangunan ekonomi kreatif nasional, dengan Bali sebagai model terbaik pengembangan ekonomi kreatif berbasis budaya lokal, sumber daya manusia, dan prinsip keberlanjutan. Ia juga menjelaskan bahwa saat ini Kemenparekraf tengah mendorong pembentukan Dinas Ekonomi Kreatif di tingkat provinsi dan kabupaten/kota. Dari data kementerian, 45 persen daerah sudah siap membentuk dinas tersendiri, dengan tambahan 20 persen kabupaten/kota dalam proses kesiapan. “Selama ini, bidang ekonomi kreatif hanya ada di bawah dinas pariwisata atau kabid. Output-nya hanya paper. Seharusnya outputnya adalah pelaku, pengusaha muda, dan karya nyata. Maka kami ingin mendorong lebih konkret pembentukan dinas ini agar sinerginya kuat,” ucapnya. Selain itu, Menteri Riefky menyampaikan dukungan untuk berbagai inisiatif ekraf di Bali, termasuk pengembangan kawasan ekonomi kreatif, fasilitasi pendanaan, penguatan regulasi perlindungan karya lokal, hingga penyelenggaraan turnamen game digital tingkat nasional dan internasional di Bali. “Kita tidak ingin kreativitas anak muda hanya dibeli murah oleh investor asing. Kita harus kuatkan posisi pelaku lokal dan melindungi potensi besar yang dimiliki anak-anak muda kita,” tambahnya. Gubernur Koster dalam kesempatan itu menjelaskan bahwa arah kebijakan pembangunan ekonomi kreatif di Bali disusun dengan memperhatikan kondisi riil Bali sebagai daerah yang tidak memiliki sumber daya tambang, tetapi kaya akan budaya, kreativitas, dan warisan lokal. Ia menyebutkan, anak-anak muda Bali memiliki potensi kreatif yang luar biasa, yang dapat dilihat dari berbagai festival dan inisiatif komunitas seperti PICA Fest, yang memunculkan berbagai karya kreatif seperti desain kaos dan produk lokal lainnya. “Ekonomi kreatif di Bali harus dibangun dari basis lokal. Kita tidak punya tambang, yang kita punya adalah budaya yang hidup. Karena itu, saya fasilitasi anak-anak muda yang kreatif, seperti dalam pembuatan produk fashion, kriya, hingga digital. Ini basis untuk masa depan,” tegasnya. Menurut Gubernur, ketergantungan Bali terhadap sektor pariwisata yang sangat tinggi, yakni sekitar 66 persen terhadap PDRB, menjadi pelajaran besar saat pandemi COVID-19. Saat sektor tersebut terguncang, perekonomian Bali terpuruk. Untuk itu, sejak periode pertama, Gubernur Koster menggagas Transformasi Ekonomi Bali berbasis enam sektor unggulan, yakni: (1) pertanian, (2) perikanan, (3) industri manufaktur branding Bali, (4) koperasi dan UMKM, (5) ekonomi kreatif dan digital, serta (6) pariwisata sebagai bonus, bukan tulang punggung. “Dengan transformasi ini, hulu-hilir ekonomi bergerak. Kalau pariwisata terganggu, ekonomi Bali tetap bisa bertahan. Ini adalah ide besar yang sedang kami bangun,” jelasnya. Ia menambahkan bahwa Bali telah berencana membentuk Badan Ekonomi Kreatif dan Digital untuk mewadahi pelaku industri kreatif, yang sebagian besar merupakan pelaku UMKM dan IKM. Ia menyebut badan ini lebih tepat dibanding sekadar bidang dalam dinas, karena dapat mengatur regulasi lintas sektor, menjembatani kebutuhan permodalan, serta memfasilitasi kerja sama dan pasar bagi pelaku ekraf. “Kita tidak bisa terlalu kapitalistik dalam ekraf. Kalau tidak dilindungi, (UMKM,red) yang kecil-kecil akan mati. Maka harus ada regulasi yang berpihak dan lembaga yang kuat. Saya yakin ekraf adalah ekonomi masa depan yang ramah lingkungan dan berkelanjutan,” katanya. Sesmen Ekraf: Bali Jadi Teladan Terbaik Nasional Sekretaris Kementerian Ekraf, Dessy Ruhati, turut menyampaikan pandangannya bahwa Bali saat ini merupakan provinsi terbaik dalam hal penerapan ekonomi kreatif. Seluruh 17 subsektor ekraf hidup dan aktif, bahkan menjadi tulang punggung perekonomian Bali saat pandemi melanda. “Bali luar biasa. Ketika semua daerah limbung karena pandemi, subsektor ekraf di Bali justru menjadi penyelamat ekonomi. Ketika ekonomi kreatif dipadukan dengan digital, dampaknya luar biasa. Bali jadi contoh nasional yang ideal,” ujar Dessy. Ia juga menegaskan bahwa sinergi pemerintah pusat dan daerah menjadi kunci dalam mempercepat penguatan kelembagaan, literasi bisnis, dan akses terhadap pasar dan investasi. Sebagai penutup pertemuan, dilakukan penukaran cenderamata antara Gubernur Bali dan Menteri Ekonomi Kreatif. Gubernur Wayan Koster menyerahkan kain endek Bali, sebagai simbol kekayaan budaya lokal dan bentuk nyata keberhasilan pelestarian warisan tekstil Bali yang kini telah mendunia. Kain endek yang diserahkan merupakan hasil produksi perajin lokal binaan Dewan Kerajinan Nasional Daerah (Dekranasda) Bali, yang juga telah sukses mendorong endek digunakan oleh berbagai merek internasional, termasuk rumah mode ternama seperti Christian Dior.(*)"

I just got back from Japan where I celebrated with two vintage Chanel bags (big moment!) . But now that I've returned… let's just say my credit card statement is giving me second thoughts.

Beyond its literal depletion, today's pick carries death-adjacent karma through its name — Dance Macabre — and the fact that it's discontinued, a revenant from an earlier era in HAGS' production. A bygone time when HAGS' fragrance strength could be so delicate it would fade noticeably after a few years in the tub. Dance Macabre is meant to be a dupe of Dior Fahrenheit, but here the signature accord feels more like an echo than a “Dupelganger.” Not a living double, but a ghost: present and recognizable, but also hazy and half-forgotten. Is the scent fading so as to encourage me to rush the soap's ultimate death? My AS pick is Barrister and Mann Presto, a scent introduced as follows: “Presto was inspired by the core innovation of Dior Fahrenheit: the offset between violet leaf (attributable, in this case, to methyl heptine carbonate) and leather (via isobutyl quinoline), set against florals and citrus to create Fahrenheit's famed 'diesel flowers' effect. We chose to soften the structure and make it less industrial, brightening it with lime, ginger, and rose. The result is incredibly stylish and sophisticated — perfect for warmer weather.” Today's heat made Presto feel like both a thematic and sensory match. For absolute clarity: this is not a dupe, Fahrenheit is just the stylistic inspiration (like a Cologne is not necessarily a dupe of Farina's recipe). Presto's splash also includes a cooling agent — not so common in B&M's products — which today came out supercharged. I did shake the bottle to try and mix the various components, but the chilling agents hit me with way more strength that I expected. Imagine a violet-flavored [Fisherman's Friend](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fisherman%27s_Friend) *—* one of those British ultra-balsamic lozenges packed with enough menthol and eucalyptus to give you brain freeze. If Fisherman's Friends are a still-legal doping agent used by politicians who need to clear their voice before a thunderous speech, my previous experiences had made me expect a much more suave and nuanced voice for Presto. But today, the balsamic blast overwhelmed everything. After getting smacked by the cooling effect, I struggled to make out any other notes in the AS. I'll try revisit this BM scent as soon as I can, maybe starting with the matching soap. Even re-smelling the AS bottle an hour later brings up more subtle notes than I could perceive on my face, so I remain optimistic about future re-trials. The last stop on today's olfactory journey is Dior's Fahrenheit EdT itself, the “classic modern” fragrance that inspired both the the previous scents. Coming off Presto's balsamic freeze, Fahrenheit initially felt unrecognizable. I could only detect some fragmented notes, like mandarin and some woods. It took several minutes for my nose to recalibrate and begin to pick up floral and vegetal threads. The usual “diesel leather” note was oddly absent, but that turned out to be a blessing: it allowed me to focus on quieter strands — lavender, chamomile — that may be harder to identify when my senses are open to the full texture of the fragrance. I am now enjoying the scent waves slowly coming back to me, like the light of dawn after a dark night. $FOF $SELFCARE for today 1) Spent the whole day with my family. 2) LG peace of mind: I'm okay with missing points for skipping the open blade challenge. Associating it with Blood Donor Day feels rather bizarre. I do have experience with positive blade exposure in DE razors, but I'm not ready for shavettes or straights: maybe one day, but not today."

Instead, it conjures up images of vinyl records and toys still made out of metal. Check Out: 4 Lesser-Known Coins That Are Worth Thousands of Dollars For You: 6 Big Shakeups Coming to Social Security in 2025 If you are a collector, saver or even accidental hoarder of your old belongings, you could be sitting on a sneaky pile of cash. As a decade marked by unique cultural and aesthetic shifts, the 1970s produced a nostalgic treasure trove of vintage items worth a lot of money. The 70s was an era of bold styles, groundbreaking music and remarkable technological advancements. Items from this decade are sought after not just for their rarity but also for the stories they tell and the memories they evoke. If you're looking to make some extra cash, you don't need to go to a Heritage Auction with your Grandma's vintage Pyrex dishes. Whether you have iconic vintage toys, Boy Scout memorabilia or complete sets of limited-edition comic books in excellent condition, you could be significantly underestimating how much items from this era are worth. Collectors and enthusiasts alike are willing to pay high prices or even top dollar for well-preserved, authentic pieces. Here are five valuable 1970s collectibles you might just have stored in your attic or basement. In just the span of a few decades, Apple computers changed the game for personal and home computers, and this all started in the 1970s. The Apple I Computer, released in 1976, stands out for collectors as Apple's inaugural product. It was famously crafted by the legendary duo of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak and embodies the pioneering spirit of the tech revolution. While the Apple II, which was released in 1977, cost about $1,300 at the time of its launch, now it could fetch you over an estimated $6,600. If it's in decent condition with its monitor, separate keyboard or casing and five-color on-screen graphics, it could be worth selling. Collectors avidly seek out original Apple-1 units, especially those in working condition or with their original packaging. These rare pieces can get a whopping $220,000 at auctions, which is a testament to their enduring significance in the tech world. Still, making a cool $6,000 for other vintage models isn't so bad either for what you once considered junk in your garage. Explore More: 7 McDonald's Toys Worth Way More Today The 1970s ushered in the golden age of video gaming, with several iconic consoles and games that have become highly sought-after by both gamers and collectors. The Atari video computer system, known as the Atari 2600 after 1977, was a trailblazer in gaming entertainment. Here are some examples of what just basic vintage games could make you if you sell them. Space Invaders (Atari 2600, 1978): $75 to $1,450 Pong (original Atari Pong C-100, 1972): $100 to $150 Asteroids (original arcade machine, 1979): $1,200 Collectors today prize well-maintained Atari consoles and rare game cartridges, with some fetching several thousand dollars. These home or arcade video games, particularly in their original, or best possible condition, can be valued between $1,000 to $5,000, making them a goldmine for those looking to clean out old boxes you've had stored since childhood. The 1970s were a golden era for toys, with several iconic brands and characters emerging that are still celebrated today, such as all things Star Wars. Following the release of this culturally transformative box office powerhouse in 1977, these figures became instant favorites. And the rarer the toy, the heftier the price tag, as you can see from the following insanely valuable Star Wars toys. Rocket-Firing Boba Fett Prototypes (1979): Only two dozen or so were made and this action figure had a different utility than other models. This would be why it sold for $204,435 at auction. Obi-Wan Kenobi with Double-Telescoping Lightsaber (1977): This is a rare Star Wars toy and sold at an auction for $76,000 in 2018. Double Telescoping Darth Vader (1977): Though the initial version never made it to market, the ones that do exist need heavy authentication. This particular version was purchased for $24,500 at an auction, still in its box. Particularly coveted are the originals and extremely rare models from the late 1970s, such as the Boba Fett figure with a firing rocket pack, action figures with different utilities than other models or just ones that didn't have a lot made. These figures, particularly in mint condition and original packaging, represent not just a piece of cinema history but a lucrative investment. The 70s fashion scene was marked by iconic trends of legendary designers strutted on the runways from some of the world's first supermodels. Original pieces from this era, particularly from fashion giants like Gucci, Halston, Bob Macki, Yves Saint Laurent and Dior, are highly coveted. These vintage items can range in price from several hundred to thousands of dollars, depending on the piece and its condition. If you have 1970s pieces in good condition just sitting in your closet, you should consider selling them online yourself or through sites like Thredup, which will buy your designer pieces for resale on its site. The late 1970s witnessed the advent of personal electronics that changed entertainment forever. The Sony Walkman TPS-L2, introduced in 1979, is a notable example. Now, it's fetching upwards of $2,300 on platforms like eBay. Similarly, the original Sony Trinitron color TVs are valued at $1,000 or more among collectors. In today's mindset of always throwing away your old phone to replace it with the newest model, it's nice to see that relics of the electronic past still have value. Before you toss your old retro televisions or Walkmans, it may be worth a Google search to see what they're worth on eBay...."

6ce083c84a20799db812d1f29571ea16,2025-06-15 02:41:00,id,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[id]Menekraf Puji Ekosistem Kreatif di Bali DENPASAR, NusaBali - Menteri Ekonomi Kreatif (Menekraf) Teuku Riefky Harsya mengapresiasi keberhasilan Bali dalam membangun ekosistem ekonomi kreatif yang kuat dan menyeluruh. Dia menyebut Bali sebagai contoh nyata keberhasilan Undang-undang Ekonomi Kreatif (UU Ekraf). “Bali adalah success story dari UU Ekraf. Hampir semua subsektor hidup di sini. Sebanyak 17 subsektor yang kita tetapkan, dari fashion, kuliner, seni pertunjukan, arsitektur, desain, film, musik, hingga konten digital dan AI, semuanya berkembang di Bali,” kata Menteri Riefky saat melakukan pertemuan dengan Gubernur Bali Wayan Koster di Rumah Jabatan Gubernur Bali Jayasabha, Denpasar, Jumat (13/6). Menteri Riefky menyebut Bali sebagai contoh nyata keberhasilan Undang-undang Ekonomi Kreatif, yang sebelumnya digagas sejak dirinya menjabat di Komisi X DPR RI. Pertemuan Menteri Riefky dan Gubernur Koster membahas arah pembangunan ekonomi kreatif nasional, dengan Bali sebagai model terbaik pengembangan ekonomi kreatif berbasis budaya lokal, sumber daya manusia, dan prinsip keberlanjutan. Dia juga menjelaskan bahwa saat ini Kemekraf tengah mendorong pembentukan dinas ekonomi kreatif di tingkat provinsi dan kabupaten/kota. Dari data kementerian, 45 persen daerah sudah siap membentuk dinas tersendiri, dengan tambahan 20 persen kabupaten/kota dalam proses kesiapan. “Selama ini, bidang ekonomi kreatif hanya ada di bawah dinas pariwisata atau kepala bidang (kabid). Output-nya hanya paper. Seharusnya outputnya adalah pelaku, pengusaha muda, dan karya nyata. Maka kami ingin mendorong lebih konkret pembentukan dinas ini agar sinerginya kuat,” ucapnya. Selain itu, Menteri Riefky menyampaikan dukungan untuk berbagai inisiatif ekraf di Bali, termasuk pengembangan kawasan ekonomi kreatif, fasilitasi pendanaan, penguatan regulasi perlindungan karya lokal, hingga penyelenggaraan turnamen game digital tingkat nasional dan internasional di Bali. “Kita tidak ingin kreativitas anak muda hanya dibeli murah oleh investor asing. Kita harus kuatkan posisi pelaku lokal dan melindungi potensi besar yang dimiliki anak-anak muda kita,” tambahnya. Gubernur Koster pada kesempatan itu menjelaskan bahwa arah kebijakan pembangunan ekonomi kreatif di Bali disusun dengan memperhatikan kondisi riil Bali sebagai daerah yang tidak memiliki sumber daya tambang, tetapi kaya akan budaya, kreativitas, dan warisan lokal. Dia menyebutkan, anak-anak muda Bali memiliki potensi kreatif yang luar biasa, yang dapat dilihat dari berbagai festival dan inisiatif komunitas seperti PICA Fest, yang memunculkan berbagai karya kreatif seperti desain kaos dan produk lokal lainnya. “Ekonomi kreatif di Bali harus dibangun dari basis lokal. Kita tidak punya tambang, yang kita punya adalah budaya yang hidup. Karena itu, saya fasilitasi anak-anak muda yang kreatif, seperti dalam pembuatan produk fashion, kriya, hingga digital. Ini basis untuk masa depan,” tegasnya. Menurut Gubernur Koster, ketergantungan Bali terhadap sektor pariwisata yang sangat tinggi, yakni sekitar 66 persen terhadap PDRB, menjadi pelajaran besar saat pandemi Covid-19. Saat sektor tersebut terguncang, perekonomian Bali terpuruk. Untuk itu, sejak periode pertama, Gubernur Koster menggagas Transformasi Ekonomi Bali berbasis enam sektor unggulan, yakni pertanian, perikanan, industri manufaktur branding Bali, koperasi dan UMKM, ekonomi kreatif dan digital, serta pariwisata sebagai bonus, bukan tulang punggung. “Dengan transformasi ini, hulu hilir ekonomi bergerak. Kalau pariwisata terganggu, ekonomi Bali tetap bisa bertahan. Ini adalah ide besar yang sedang kami bangun,” tuturnya. Gubernur Koster menambahkan bahwa Bali telah berencana membentuk Badan Ekonomi Kreatif dan Digital untuk mewadahi pelaku industri kreatif, yang sebagian besar merupakan pelaku UMKM dan IKM. Dia menyebut badan ini lebih tepat dibanding sekadar bidang dalam dinas, karena dapat mengatur regulasi lintas sektor, menjembatani kebutuhan permodalan, serta memfasilitasi kerja sama dan pasar bagi pelaku ekraf. “Kita tidak bisa terlalu kapitalistik dalam ekraf. Kalau tidak dilindungi, (UMKM, Red) yang kecil-kecil akan mati. Maka harus ada regulasi yang berpihak dan lembaga yang kuat. Saya yakin ekraf adalah ekonomi masa depan yang ramah lingkungan dan berkelanjutan,” katanya. Sekretaris Kementerian Ekraf Dessy Ruhati, turut menyampaikan pandangannya dalam pertemuan itu. Dessy mengatakan, bahwa Bali saat ini merupakan provinsi terbaik dalam hal penerapan ekonomi kreatif. Seluruh 17 subsektor ekraf hidup dan aktif, bahkan menjadi tulang punggung perekonomian Bali saat pandemi melanda. “Bali luar biasa. Ketika semua daerah limbung karena pandemi, subsektor ekraf di Bali justru menjadi penyelamat ekonomi. Ketika ekonomi kreatif dipadukan dengan digital, dampaknya luar biasa. Bali jadi contoh nasional yang ideal,” ucap Dessy. Dia juga menegaskan bahwa sinergi pemerintah pusat dan daerah menjadi kunci dalam mempercepat penguatan kelembagaan, literasi bisnis, dan akses terhadap pasar dan investasi. Sebagai penutup pertemuan, dilakukan penukaran cenderamata antara Gubernur Koster dan Menteri Riefky. Gubernur Koster menyerahkan kain endek Bali, sebagai simbol kekayaan budaya lokal dan bentuk nyata keberhasilan pelestarian warisan tekstil Bali yang kini telah mendunia.

Valentino Swept through time on the current of music, Zoë Bleu finds reflections of herself in the characters she embodies — gathering fragments of identity, drifting from dreams into a life steeped in enchantment. We find her strutting the streets while wearing Valentino when we speak to her for her digital cover story for Schön! 48 , where she opens up about her character, Elisabeta, her 15th-century role in the upcoming film 'Dracula: A Love Tale'. “She knows what she wants. She gets what she wants when she wants it,” Sidel says. She's a princess, but she acts like a queen. She's got a regal, kind of bitchy presence,” she jests. “The clothes really bring the role to life. I have a beautiful velvet dress encrusted with pearls, and it makes the bosom look amazing. Everything is covered, but it's done in such a way that you can see that she's sensual.” Inspired in part by Francis Ford Coppola's 1992 interpretation of Bram Stoker's Dracula, French director Luc Besson's Dracula: A Love Tale reimagines the legend through the lens of eternal love and reincarnation. “The very classical, historical way of thinking about 'Dracula' is 'I'm going to suck your blood,' and 'You are mine,' but that's not this Dracula. It's really something else; it's a love story, not a horror film. It's like 'Romeo and Juliet',” Sidel explains. In Besson's telling, both Elisabeta and Mina—the dual characters portrayed by Sidel—share an everlasting connection with Dracula, played by Caleb Landry Jones. This bond transcends time and identity. Sidel calls it “soul love.” To cultivate this depth of emotion on screen, Sidel and Landry Jones engaged in Butoh, a distinct form of avant-garde dance theatre marked by deliberate, expressive motion and inward emotional focus. “It was interesting to try and create a friendship through dance and music,” Sidel says. This nonverbal approach offered a profound avenue for connection, grounded in emotion and presence. Another technique they used to sync emotionally was simultaneous music listening. This shared experience became particularly important for anchoring pivotal scenes. A recurring lullaby, for example, acts as a sonic thread linking Elisabeta with Mina — bridging centuries through melody. “My music project L'ESPIRAL was heavily impacted,” she continues. “I've made four of those [poems] into songs that I'm going to record this summer.” Sidel sees a rhythmic logic in existence itself: “Everything is music, isn't it? All of existence has a vibrational frequency; that's music. Love is a frequency; it's music. Like star-crossed lovers, a world begins between these two souls, these two people fall in love. And there is a music to it.” jacket. CHANEL top + skirt. Yohji Yamamoto earrings. Swarovski opposite dress. Rokh shirt. Les Fleurs Studio shoes. Roberto Cavalli coat. Mossi dress + bra.

1lbti03,2025-06-15 06:19:16,en,REDDIT,"  Hello, hello. Honestly, undertones are a bit of a mind melt. I'd describe myself as a warm olive, leaning more warm than olive if that makes sense? People often say that they can see they look really green without makeup, but I've struggled to ever notice that myself. What I did notice was that foundations often looked too orange or grey. So it was from this sub that I got the idea of mixing in green colour corrector to help neutralise my base products and it works really well! Am I really an olive, I have no idea. I thought I'd contribute some swatches to people who may be a similar colouring for me. I've tried to pick some photos where you can see my skin tone/makeup in different lighting. From top to bottom: * Natasha Denona, Hy-Glam Concealer - **YN6** (this is too light, I'd go a shade darker) * Hourglass, Vanish Concealer - **Apricot** (too warm, but good to correct under eye circles) * Dior, Backstage Face and Body Foundation - **2WO** (slightly light, but perfect shade!) * Loreal, 32 Hour Freshwear Foundation - **140** * Loreal, True Match Nude Plumping Tinted Serum - **4-5 Medium** (slightly dark) * Mac, Face and Body Foundation - **N4** Swatch photos are taken inside and outside in natural sunlight. Generally, I wear a mix of Dior/Mac :) with a dash of green. In the summer, the I can get away with much warmer foundations. The only thing I can't get away with ever, is grey.

All Fab Ethical allfabethical hatte gestern zur Fashion Demo in Potsdam-Babelsberg aufgerufen. Eine Modenschau mal etwas anders. Gekommen um zu bleiben - denn Angela will in Zukunft ihre Upcycling-Fashion Digital, Mobil und Pop Up präsentieren und uns Kunden so noch mehr das Bewusstsein für nachhaltige Mode schärfen. Unter der Präsenz des Fernsehen, heimischen Printmedien und der Brandenburger Polizei demonstrierten 25 Models mit Plakaten - zeigten Fashion, die aus Stoffen von Bett- oder Tischwäsche, Schlafsäcken, Designer-Deadstocks von Dior und Chanel und auch aus Herrenanzügen, die von ihr entworfen und produziert wird. Zirkuläre Mode anstatt Fast - oder Ultra-Fast-Fashion, denn die Fakten sprechen für sich. Hoher Wasserverbrauch bei Anbau und Produktion, geringe Löhne und keine Absicherung der Näherinnen, viel Chemie die in der Umwelt landet und nicht zuletzt riesige textile Müllberge, die nicht nur von uns aus in Drittländer verkauft werden und dort für die heimische Produktion zum Problem wird, sondern auch die einzelnen Fasern können in den wenigsten Fällen getrennt und zu neuen Stoffen recycelt werden. Mode die wenige Euro kostet um anschließend weggeworfen zu werden. Die Textilindustrie ist die dreckigste überhaupt - ein Umdenken bei uns Verbrauchern ist dringend nötig. Im Anschluss der Demonstration hatten Steffi steffi_trendmiss und ich die Möglichkeit die Kollektion direkt vom Runway näher anzusehen, mit anderen Besuchern und der Designerin in Gespräche und Diskussion zu gehen und auch neue Love-Pieces zu kaufen, wie z.B mein Rock, der auch von Angela und ihrem Team entworfen wurde.

mov_AB948E82AC157DF9AECD29013DB9DB86,2025-06-15 10:43:30,bg,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[bg]Той е милиардер, любител на яхтите, който се жени за бляскава телевизионна водеща, известна с екстравагантните си публични изяви. А звездната сватба на Джеф Безос с Лорън Санчес изглежда ще съответства на бляскавия им начин на живот, като сега е разкрита внушителната цена, която ще заплатят за тържеството. Миналата година се носеха слухове, че ще проведат церемония на стойност 600 милиона долара в Аспен, Колорадо, през декември, но основателят на Amazon ги определи като ""напълно неверни"". Вместо това сега се твърди, че двойката ще събере известни личности, политици и водещи световни бизнесмени на купон във Венеция, по-късно този месец. Пищното събитие и обширният му списък с гости ще означават засилена охрана, затворени улици, наблюдавано въздушно пространство и силно полицейско присъствие. Суперяхтата на Безос ""Кору"" на стойност 500 милиона долара ще акостира в Сан Базилио - най-близкото място, до което може да се доближи до центъра на града поради крехката му екосистема. Лобно място ще бъде и хотел ""Cipriani"", където ще бъдат настанени много от гостите. Смята се, че Безос, Санчес и техните семейства ще отседнат на яхтата с девет спални, а останалите гости ще бъдат разпределени в близките хотели ""Cipriani"" и ""Aman"". Въпреки че присъствието им не е потвърдено, се носят слухове, че са поканени Орландо Блум и Кейти Пери, Крис Дженър, Ким Кардашиян, Джаред Къшнър и Иванка Тръмп. Сватбените експерти Кунал Мадан, главен изпълнителен директор и основател на DressPreservation.com, и Зоуи Бюк от Hitched.co.uk казаха пред Daily Mail, че сватбата вероятно ще струва между 15 и 20 милиона долара - в зависимост от ексклузивността на мястото, планирането на местоположението и броя на знаменитостите. Развлечения С очакваното участие на едни от най-известните имена в света, Кунал казва, че може да се очаква впечатляващ набор от забавления. ""Очаквайте изпълнители, достойни за хедлайнери на фестивал, или планиран списък с международни таланти. С разходите за изпълнители, сценично оборудване, озвучително оборудване и лицензионни разходи, между 3 и 5 милиона долара е разумна цена"", сподели той. Зоуи Бюк се съгласява, казвайки, че бляскавата двойка определено ще иска някой известен и силно въздействащ за големия си ден - предполагайки, че може би се надяват на изпълнение от Бионсе или Андреа Бочели. ""Очаква се да платите над 2 милиона долара за частен сет от такова голямо име"", обясни тя. Транспорт Лорън и Джеф вероятно ще имат много приятели, които ще присъстват на тържествата им, а част от уикенда може да включва транспортиране на гостите им до мястото на събитието. ""Пътуване с частен самолет, със суперяхти или летене с хеликоптер - транспортните услуги за известни личности могат да варират от 500 000 до 2 милиона долара, в зависимост от сигурността и логистиката"", каза Кунал. Сватбена рокля Лорън е известна със страстта си към скъпите дрехи, като често облича дизайнерски тоалет на червения килим. И експертите очакват, че големият й ден няма да бъде изключение, като се очаква да заложи на няколко визии, които ще сменя през цялата вечер. ""Сватбените couture рокли струват от 500 000 до 1 милион долара, да не говорим за сватбена рокля от висша мода от Dior, Valentino или Elie Saab"", посочва Кунал. ""Аксесоарите, поръчковите костюми за Безос и стилистите вдигат цената."" ""Ще бъдат по поръчка"", потвърждава Зоуи. ""Персонализирана булчинска визия от модна къща за висша мода, с аксесоарите, може лесно да надхвърли 1 милион долара. И това дори не броим за най-висококачествените бижута, които двойката ще носи."" Цветя и декор Носят се слухове, че двойката е резервирала Scuola Grande della Misericordia - една от най-големите и величествени сгради в историческия център на Венеция - като част от екстравагантното празненство през уикенда, което се предлага на зашеметяващата цена от 20 милиона долара. В допълнение към зашеметяващия фон на Венеция, разкошното място вероятно ще включва някои екстравагантни декорации. Кунал прогнозира екстравагантни цветни инсталации и персонализиран декор - вероятно от някой като Джеф Лийтъм или Престън Бейли. ""За продължително тържество това е между 1 и 3 милиона долара, лесно"", каза той. Фотографи Според Зоуи, дуото ще наеме повече от един фотограф - вероятно ще има цял екип, който да заснеме големия им ден. ""Това лесно може да струва над четвърт милион долара, в зависимост от това колко фотографи са им необходими и колко дни продължава събитието"", изчисли тя. Кунал добавя, че услугите на висококачествени сватбени фотографи обикновено струват между 100 000 и 250 000 долара. ""Плюс наемането на цял творчески екип - видеооператори, екипи за дронове, специалисти по планиране на съдържание в социалните мрежи - може да доведе до над 500 000 долара"", прогнозира той. Кетъринг Младоженците вероятно ще се насладят на едни от най-добрите ястия - приготвени от готвачи от световна класа - за сватбения си ден. ""С меню с качество Michelin, висококачествени продукти и кулинарен персонал, кетърингът може да струва от 500 000 до 1 милион долара, особено с луксозни комбинации от вина и закуски"", казва Кунал. Зоуи се съгласява, посочвайки, че това може да е многодневно събитие, което би увеличило разходите. ""В зависимост от броя на гостите, количеството ястия и дали съставките трябва да бъдат внесени, цената може да надхвърли 1 милион долара"", сподели тя. Планьор Колкото Лорън и Джеф да имат визията за големия си ден, сватбеният планьор ще се погрижи за по-фините детайли - което ще струва доста пари. ""Сватбен агент, който организира многодневно събитие с много известни гости, би начислявал процент от сметката, която може да достигне до 2 милиона долара"", каза Зоуи. Кунал прогнозира малко по-ниска сума, но отбелязва, че прогнозата му не включва допълнителния персонал, от който организаторът ще се нуждае. ""Организатор на събития в холивудски стил, организиращ продукция от такъв мащаб (евентуално в няколко държави или дестинации), би струвал от 250 000 до 500 000 долара плюс, в допълнение към разходите за персонал"", каза той. Сватбени подаръци Гостите няма да си тръгнат с празни ръце от сватбата, като експертите прогнозират някои ""изискани предложения"" от романтичния уикенд. ""Сватбените подаръци за тържество и подобренията в преживяването на гостите могат да струват от 200 000 до 500 000 долара"", каза Кунал...."

Charlene, 47, rocked the 'Elliot' dress by Diane von Furstenberg with a crew neckline and belted waist. The designer number featured an abstract print in cream and ochre. The sleeveless dress was paired with flat shoes, and she wore her hair up with two face-framing strands pulled out at the front. Her lookalike daughter also sported a designer look. Gabriella was seen in a palm tree-printed tea dress with an adorable floaty skirt by luxury French designer, Chloe, which retails for £310. She also wore a pair of lavish Dior sandals. Meanwhile, her brother was so sweet in a white polo top and dark-wash jeans. The Monagasque royal family was spotted together during the inauguration of the 6th Meeting of the Historic Sites of Monaco, where Prince Albert gave a speech. Princess Charlene and Gabriella's joint engagement Though seeing Princess Gabriella on a public engagement is by no means an everyday occurrence, she did make an important appearance earlier this month. Gabriella, along with her brother, joined Charlene during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron and his wife Brigitte during their two-day state visit to the Prince's Palace in Monaco ahead of the Unoc3. The young royal was adorable in white tea dress and matching Mary-Janes. Her sweet white ensemble matched her mother's white Dior trousers and killer heels. Charlene did, however, opt to add a touch of colour to her look with a pistachio green short-sleeved boucle jacket, also by Dior. Gabriella's milestone The princess wore all white for a more poignant reason in May as she and Prince Jacques made their first holy communion. ""On this Day of First Communion, we extend our most sincere congratulations to Crown Prince James and Princess Gabriella who received this sacrament with faith and compulsion,"" the message on the Prince's Palace's official Instagram page read. ""On this day of First Communion, we extend our heartfelt congratulations to Hereditary Prince Jacques and Princess Gabriella, who received this sacrament with faith and reverence.""

From crunching numbers in finance to crafting stories that move people, I've officially graduated with my Master's in Marketing from HEC Paris and what a journey it's been… When I started, I knew I loved brands. But I didn't expect to discover such a passion for strategy, storytelling, and the way marketing can truly connect with people. From winning a pitch for a Gen Z fragrance concept at Parfums Christian Dior To launching a purposeful sun protection campaign with La Roche-Posay Laboratoire Dermatologique (and winning the L'Oréal  bootcamp 👀) Reimagining Veepee for a younger generation with no paid media, no social, just creativity and bold strategy Crafting a brand perception shift for Amazon with DDB And digging deep into community-led business models with Her Third Place at Capgemini Invent ✨ Each project stretched my thinking, sharpened my instincts, and confirmed how much I love building ideas that resonate. This chapter ends, but my mission continues: To tell stories that matter To create experiences that last To lead with insight, intention, and imagination Merci to every teammate, professor, mentor, and late-night brainstorm that helped shape this chapter. And to the younger me who thought she wasn't creative enough, look at her now I'll never forget the words that echoed during our graduation ceremony. “We're all born creators, yet many of us forget its power,” said Fidji Simo — a reminder to never silence that inner voice that dares to build, shape, and lead. Éloïc Peyrache reminded us that excellence isn't about perfection, but about courage, humility, and lifting others as we rise. He left us with a powerful call: to always ""dare the impossible"". Here's to carrying those words forward with purpose, passion, and with the belief that the best stories are still ahead. #HECParis #HECgrad2025 #MastersinMarketing"

mov_5D140A6531C9209B553E10F9EF7BFCED,2025-06-15 13:42:05,en,WEB,"  They are the 'cocaine babes' of Sydney's ritzy eastern suburbs - the glamorous women caught supplying the addictive drug to the Harbour City's rich and famous. The day jobs of these genetically blessed (and surgically enhanced) dealers who were busted by the NSW Drug Squad have included reality TV stars, bikini models and Instagram influencers. Then there was the event planner who became known as the east's 'cocaine queen'. That was until cops swooped and arrested her after surveilling her delivery of almost 600 bags of blow to customers in more than 370 separate locations across Sydney. While that meant Danielle Tara Hogan had to swap her sumptuous lifestyle of overseas holidays and designer clothes for prison greens and a jail cell, it hardly ended the practice of pretty women peddling narcotics to multimillion-dollar waterfront and beachside addresses. And while NSW Police have worked hard to crack down on the nefarious trade of cocaine supply by both women and men, their success doesn't seem to have discouraged others from entering the criminal fray. Just last November, a young woman was dragged into a police van in Sydney's CBD after being caught in a targeted arrest. Dressed in a skimpy black top and white shorts, the nubile female suspect was arrested on Hunter St in broad daylight on a Thursday afternoon by an undercover cop posing as an eshay. Strike Force Northrop is now a pre-Christmas tradition for NSW Police, whose officers gleefully announce the drugs and cash seized during their statewide stings on so-called dial-a-dealers. It's a routine effort to stem the illicit trade in a city in the grips of an 'insatiable' love affair with cocaine. In the background, drug squads have made significant inroads into large-scale importations with a series of major raids on bikie gangs. In 2022, they raided a gang clubhouse, seizing bags of cash amounting to $1.2million, as well as luxury cars, Rolex watches, Louis Vuitton sunglasses and 12.5kg of illicit drugs worth $12million, including cocaine bricks stamped with Christian Dior logos. The same year, a massive 13kg of cocaine worth $5.8million was found inside an air cargo consignment of Capri wafer ice cream cone packets from Greece to Sydney. A year earlier, Bondi party boy Darren John Mohr, 46, was jailed for a maximum of 32 years over a $150million cocaine importation plot. The hulking former café owner had conspired to import 500kg of cocaine from Chile to the Sydney fish markets by boat in 2016. But amid the big hits, police have worked hard to crack down on the smaller operations. These include catching the glamorous women who have acted as delivery drivers doing door-to-door drop-offs of bags of cocaine, as well as the women and men engaging in the even more risky business of selling on the street. The woman apprehended last November on Hunter St in the CBD was carrying both drugs and cash when she tried to sell to the undercover 'eshay'. During a search of her vehicle, police allegedly discovered 14 bags of cocaine and more than $6,000 in $50 notes hidden in a compartment. She was taken to Sydney's Day St Police Station and charged with six offences: supplying a prohibited drug, dealing with the proceeds of crime, possession of a prohibited drug, driving while suspended, and failing to display P plates. Her arrest was part of the larger police effort to dismantle dealer operations linked to cocaine and other drugs, which last year took place between November 22 and December 7. Of these, 64 were charged with supplying a prohibited drug, 44 were charged with drug possession offences, and one person was also charged with domestic violence-related crimes. More than $20,000 worth of drugs were seized, including 560g of cocaine, 78 MDMA caps, weed, ketamine and ice. Almost $99,000 of cash and several cars were also seized. Among those arrested, a 22-year-old man was found driving around the CBD with 14 bags of cocaine and thousands in cash, and a 26-year-old man was arrested in the east with cocaine and cash in a hidden compartment. A 45-year-old woman and a 31-year-old man were also found driving down Bondi Rd with 24 bags of cocaine, more than $3000 in cash and a knife. THE 'COCAINE QUEEN' In December 2021, glamorous Bondi local Danielle Tara Hogan was jailed for a maximum of three years and 10 months for supplying 580 bags of cocaine in 370 deliveries across Sydney. The then-26-year-old, who posted photos of her lavish holidays, designer clothes and dinners at trendy beachfront bars despite being unemployed, was the 'go-to' dealer supplying 'bags' to parties, particularly in the summer months. She has been variously described as the 'drugs pin-up party girl' and the 'cocaine queen' of Sydney's eastern suburbs. Hogan's high life was upended by her arrest in late 2019 after police had been surveilling her 'dial-a-dealer' work for a drugs syndicate. One of three women allegedly part of the cocaine ring, she was charged after police raided seven properties and seized nearly 1.6kg of cocaine with an estimated street value of $600,000. Hogan would claim that when she 'realised' cocaine was not just a harmless party drug and that it could destroy lives, she tried to quit the syndicate via text - with dire consequences. 'They threatened me and drove me to my parents' house with veiled threats towards them,' a court heard. Her lawyer said Hogan had never tried cocaine and was dealing drugs for '$25 a pop' because she had no other work and owed $40,000 in parking fines, tolls and other debts. Barrister Jehane Ghabrial told the NSW District Court in 2021 that the female crims in prison had falsely believed Hogan was the east's 'cocaine queen' and had extorted her during her brief time behind bars on remand. She argued sensational media reports had put 'a target' on her client's back. Judge Mark Williams SC conceded that 'being made publicly the pin-up girl for a dial-a-dealer cocaine syndicate led to punishment while she was in' Silverwater Women's Correctional Centre. 'Inmates believed she was a wealthy eastern suburbs cocaine queen and they harassed her believing she had access to money or drugs,' he said. He concluded that the publicity, Hogan's attempts to rehabilitate and her guilty plea worked in her favour and sentenced her to three years and ten months' imprisonment. Hogan would serve a minimum 17 months with her earliest parole in April 2023. In early 2024, it was reported that Hogan had joined a exercise-based program for reformed inmates, Confit, and had gone from rock bottom to redemption. She blamed a decade-long cycle of drug addiction and domestic violence for the offending which had landed her in prison. THE BIKINI MODEL Disgraced socialite and bikini model Kirsty Dayment has managed to invoke the ire of two judges in her dealings with the justice system since getting caught supplying cocaine and MDMA from a luxury beachfront apartment with her boyfriend. In 2015, police stormed the Coogee flat where 33-year-old Dayment and Nicholas James Riganias had 100g of cocaine and 1.36kg of MDMA or ecstasy concealed in a suitcase. Riganias, 30, went straight to prison and stayed there as Dayment, who was bailed after a brief stint behind bars, delayed and had court hearings adjourned on her serious drug charges. The woman who once strode the red carpet with A-listers and posed provocatively in fashion magazines eventually pleaded guilty to supplying a large commercial quantity of drugs, and supplying 85g of cocaine. On her talent page, Dayment described herself as an actor, model, dancer, film and stage crew member, and photographer. She said she had featured in Ralph and FHM, appeared on the ..."

Nesprával sa ako jeden': Spoluhviezda Johnnyho Deppa z filmu Arizona Dream Paulina Porizková potvrdila, že Depp by na nakrúcaní prišiel k elektrikárom a posádke, vďaka čomu sa všetci cítili ako doma Johnny Depp je už nejaký čas jedným z našich obľúbených hercov a jeho brilantné herecké schopnosti nie sú jediným dôvodom. Na internete je veľa príbehov, ktoré vysoko hovoria o milej osobnosti herca, najmä tie, ktoré zdieľajú jeho kolegovia. Všetci vieme, že narábať so slávou s pokojom nie je pre každého šálka čaju. Niekedy sa sláva môže dostať do hlavy, čo vedie k prudkému nárastu ich ega. Keď však hovoríme o Johnnym Deppovi, zdá sa, že slovo „ego“ jednoducho nie je súčasťou jeho slovníka. Na podporu tohto tvrdenia sa bývalá hviezda Johnnyho Deppa, Paulina Porizková, porozprávala o čase na pľaci, keď ju herec príjemne prekvapil a jednoducho bola radosť byť s ním a pracovať! Prečítajte si tiež: Dior zostal s Johnnym Deppom až do úplného konca napriek tomu, že ich fanúšikovia odbíjali, keď vyhrávala Amber Heard – je teraz údajne „líder v predaji parfumov“ Johnnyho Deppa chváli Paulína Porizková Prečítajte si tiež: „Videli svoje vlastné bývalé manželky a bitky o opatrovníctvo“: Právnik Amber Heardovej tvrdí, že Johnny Depp vyhral iba preto, že ho jeho fanúšikovia videli ako „obeť kultúry zrušenia a hrdinu anti-establišmentu“ Paulína Porizková a Johnny Depp spolupracovali na nezávislom filme z roku 1993 s názvom Arizona Dream. Film režíroval Emir Kusturica a film sa točil okolo Alexa Blackmara v podaní Deppa. Vychádza 22. novembra 2022 v epizóde seriálu Venované Dougovi Bruntovi podcast, Porizková si spomenula, ako Depp nedovolil, aby jeho status superstar ovplyvnil to, ako sa správal na pľaci. Porizková uviedla, že keďže film mal hviezdny súbor, na pľaci bolo veľa veľkých eg. Uistila sa však, že objasnila, že Depp nebol súčasťou tejto skupiny, pretože bol veľmi láskavý k ľuďom okolo neho. „Bolo to hviezdne obsadenie, takže na pľaci bolo veľa ega a Johnny, ktorý bol v tom čase najväčším lámačom sŕdc na svete, sa tak nesprával. Bol skutočne láskavý k elektrikárom a posádke. “ Porizková pokračovala, že Deppova láskavosť ku všetkým okolo ju ju inšpirovala, aby sa pokúsila stať sa viac ako herec, keď si robila poznámky o Deppovej láskavosti na natáčaní. Dodala, že okolo seba vytvoril pokojný priestor jemnosti. „Johnny bol taký milý, bol taký láskavý k ľuďom okolo seba, že sa stal priateľom každého. Bol skutočne láskavý ku každému na natáčaní a ja som si to naozaj všimol. Kam išiel, vytvoril okolo seba malý pokojný priestor jemnosti, láskavosti. Ľudia na to skutočne reagovali. Hovoril som si: 'Chcem byť taký. '“ Zatiaľ čo jeho láskavosť bola pre Porizkovú veľmi inšpirujúca, spomenula ďalší dôvod, prečo si o nich tak vysoko myslí Piráti z Karibiku herec. Uviedla, že zatiaľ čo Depp mohol robiť obrovské filmy v Hollywoode, rozhodol sa venovať svoj čas a úsilie „ zvláštny malý nezávislý film.' Depp má za to rešpekt od Porizkovej. Prečítajte si tiež: „To je dôvod, prečo je KOZA“: Fanúšikovia vítajú hrdinský čin Johnnyho Deppa, ktorý minul takmer 50 000 dolárov za 500 kabátov, aby udržal posádku Pirátov z Karibiku v teple Akt láskavosti Johnnyho Deppa Súbory Piráti z Karibiku: Na vlnách cudzincov zasiahla britská zima, čo posádke mimoriadne sťažilo prácu v takých drsných poveternostných podmienkach. Zadajte Depp. Depp sa snažil minúť desiatky tisíc dolárov z vlastného vrecka na nákup nepremokavých zimných búnd pre štáb filmu. V rozhovore pre The Sun jeden z členov posádky pochválil Deppa za veľkorysé gesto. „Johnny zaplatil z vlastného vrecka za to, že nás všetkých 500 má pekné teplé nepremokavé [bundy]. Je to veľká morálna podpora a ďalší príklad toho, prečo je jedným z najkrajších ľudí v Hollywoode. “ Nemohli sme viac súhlasiť. 500 zimných búnd nie je lacné. Aj keď pre jedného z najväčších hercov súčasnosti nemuseli byť peniaze problém, jeho nezištná akcia mu určite priniesla pár bodiek so štábom. Aj fanúšikovia chvália Deppa za jeho štedrosť, nehovoriac o štábe. Určite má v tomto odvetví povesť a podľa toho aj žije! Zdroj: Venované podcastu Doug Brunt"

b41a3076a0e5915d647f873aa293630c,2025-06-15 22:05:00,en,WEB,"  Like many mentor-mentee relationships – think philosophers Socrates and Plato, and couturiers Yves Saint Laurent and Christian Dior – the bond between the two is more than strong. It is like a living thread, running between generations, tying past to present. With just one look, Singaporean drag artist Opera Tang, who uses she/her pronouns, knows exactly what her 94-year-old grandmother means – and can finish her sentence without a word being said. Watch their video here. Similarly, the spritely Madam Martha Lau understands the 30-year-old's costume creative ideas with ease, even with a language barrier between them. Since 2020, Ah Ma – as Ms Tang calls her – has taken her grandchild under her wing and started imparting the finer art of tailoring. Like many young Singaporeans, Ms Tang only speaks a smattering of Teochew, which Ah Ma converses in. But as Ms Tang's costume-making skills improve, so has her command of the dialect – and that has brought the two closer together. Looking at their interaction, one cannot help but realise that Ah Ma is Ms Tang's biggest cheerleader. Besides working on the costumes with Ms Tang, the nonagenarian has also been to her drag performances. “When I went to watch her, she performed in the costume we made together. And there was so much applause from the audience,” says Madam Lau with immense pride. “I love her performance – and her. But it doesn't matter if I like or approve of her taking part in such performances; it's after all her interest, her passion.” With Ah Ma ageing, Ms Tang values their time spent together and wants to enjoy every minute, whether working on the sewing machine or going for a vacation together. Here, Ms Tang reveals more about their relationship, which is sewn tightly together one stitch at a time. “When I was young, there were always two sewing machines in our house – the mechanical, traditional kind. I grew up listening to the machines and the sound of my Ah Ma's feet on the pedals. All of Mum's office clot..."

8a7df1c8e53ed0ccf03168cc4b3567ef,2025-06-15 23:25:00,en,WEB,"  The Parisian innovation event Viva Technology has changed significantly since its launch in 2016. Robots, drones, and vehicles, once omnipresent, have gradually faded away, as have metaverses. This has paved the way for personalization solutions, soft mobility, and sustainable approaches, which FashionNetwork.com provides an overview of. Dermatological analysis demonstration on the L'Oréal pavilion - MG/FNW At the center of the show were the pavilions of French giants LVMH and L'Oréal Paris. The former, which presented its awards on Thursday, June 12, showcased its Machine Zero tool for detecting impurities in cashmere, as well as the Reflex Logistic augmented reality business management tool used by Dior . The Rigsters product digitization tool, developed by OKCC, was also on display, along with its bottle-decorating robotic arm. On the Bulgari side, the Dev4side product authentication tool was featured, alongside a virtual pinball machine and a Sephora vending machine. The L'Oréal pavilion was no less busy, where visitors could try a variety of services, such as the Noli personality diagnosis tool launched a year ago, a Hyperlook Studio providing make-up advice, La Roche-Posay 's dermatological suggestion device, and Lancôme 's ""nano-surfacer"". Ads Beauty Genius enabled visitors to experiment with the creation of personalized campaigns using artificial intelligence (via AI from Adobe, Omi, or Google). However, Cosmo International was the most intriguing, with its process for capturing the real scent of flowers without the use of chemicals, as explained by Valentino 's Private Talk fragrance over the past year. Not far away, at the Meta stand (notably, Facebook and Instagram), the ambitions of metaverses invading both private and professional life have fizzled out. Yet, crowds kept flocking to try the camera glasses developed with Ray-Ban . Ray-Ban Meta glasses showcase their latest developments - MG/FNW There was another pair of eyeglasses that drew attention on the Elcyo stand. With a crystallized lens that analyze gaze trajectory, these glasses adjust sharpness in real-time. Engo offered augmented-reality eyewear for sports activities. Linné Paysage presented Bionocta, a light devoid of harmful blue waves, which won a gold medal at the Concours Lépine, created by the artistic directors of the Texworld trade shows. On the sound front, Skyted offered a headset that enables listeners to understand you almost in a whisper, even amidst a hubbub. Enough to interest major retailers. Likewise, the virtual showcase concept from AWS, courtesy of Amazon , allowed customers to virtually try on a look through projection on a glass screen. France's Holoprods offered screens that create the illusion of a hologram projected into the air, which can be interacted with. Fashion and beauty In clothing, Ashirase offered a directional guidance system integrated into shoes, operating through vibration, particularly designed for the visually impaired. In the same vein, Vibra's haptic feedback screens facilitate interaction with software. Even more intriguing was the Sensora headset, which measures in real-time the emotional impact of a product, campaign, or experience (visitors were offered macaroons, as an example). The emotions of a visitor tasting a macaroon are displayed on screen via the Sensora analysis headband. - MG/FNW The Vrai tool can detect counterfeit goods, as demonstrated with two Lacoste polo shirts (one of which is fake). Optikan analyzes material structures, from wool to cardboard and wood. Still on materials, VivaTech was an opportunity to discover EFpolymer, a 100% organic, biodegradable polymer with superabsorbent properties. The same goes for United silk, whose process extends silk's applications to food and cosmetics packaging, and even medical tools. Italy's Damo presented its certification tool for the fashion industry. While Metown showcased its 3D product scanning tool, GenAI continued to broaden the possibilities of 3D printing. In beauty, Nocibé showcased its luminous brands and facial and skull helmets, while Evelab Insight explained its facial analysis device used by Shiseido , Body Shop, and Estée Lauder . Transport and logistics In logistics, Pony's sailing transport solutions were on display, while GBMS specialized in container security analysis. Appload acts as an intermediary between companies and shippers. Okular Logistics focused on heavy-duty corporate moves, while Optioryx optimized warehoused flows. DPD ( La Poste ) presented its rolling robot for deliveries, as well as a tricycle dedicated to fresh produce. The DPD autonomous delivery vehicle - MG/FNW Soft mobility was indeed present at every corner of the show. Besides Newt's futuristic autonomous minibus, bike carriers from Pelican, South Africa's Mellowvans, and Maillon Mobility were on offer. The Strasbourg-based company Karbikes provided a variation of this type of vehicle, while the ultra-low consumption U Live car garners attention. news_translation_auto Click here to read the original article.

Prices correct at time of publication. By Ariana Pezeshki There's something instantly confidence-boosting about a great fragrance. The kind that turns heads in a lift, lingers softly in your scarf, and earns compliments from strangers. And when it comes to luxury scents, few do it better than Tom Ford. Know the news with the 7NEWS app: Download today Right now, one of the designer's most iconic unisex fragrances, Tom Ford Oud Wood Eau De Parfum Spray, is available at a rare discount, saving you 31 per cent off the usual price. You can pick it up on Amazon Australia for $388.95, down from its usual $565. Yes, it's a splurge, but the kind that delivers a return in the form of compliments, confidence and all-day longevity. Tom Ford Oud Wood is rich, sexy and lasts all day, now just $388.95 on Amazon Australia. Credit: Tom Ford Why people love Tom Ford Oud Wood Tom Ford's Oud Wood has become something of a cult classic among fragrance lovers. Described as exotic, rare and intoxicating, it features one of perfumery's most treasured ingredients, agarwood (also known as oud). Used in incense rituals in many cultures, this smoky, woody note gives the fragrance its unmistakable richness. But it's not just about oud. The scent opens with a warm hit of cardamom and rosewood, balanced with sandalwood and vetiver at the heart. It's sensual without being overpowering, and the tonka bean and amber at the base give it that smooth, creamy finish that lingers beautifully on the skin. Fans say it's genderless, mysterious, and undeniably luxe. Tom Ford discounts like this don't come around often Credit: Tom Ford What the reviews say With hundreds of glowing reviews online, shoppers are calling this the “best fragrance” they've ever worn and they're not shy about the compliments it brings. One reviewer shared a particularly helpful insight: “I was very sceptical about buying this, given there is a review claiming this is fake, so sceptical I even messaged the seller HBST Supply to ask for proof of authenticity before I bought. First of all, this is absolutely real and smells amazing, none are as good as this, and none have gotten as many compliments. The best word to describe the scent is simply luxury.” They went on to say it lasts at least 13 hours, is subtle rather than overpowering, and described it as worth the investment, especially compared to other high-end men's fragrances like Dior Sauvage or Bleu de Chanel. Of course, it's still an expensive buy. The same reviewer admitted they only grabbed it because of the price drop. But even at $388, it's significantly more affordable than its usual price and still less than you'd pay in-store or at a department counter. Who is it for? This isn't your everyday gym spray or body mist. It's for the person who wants to feel put together with a single spritz. Whether you're dressing up for a night out, heading into a big work meeting, or just want a signature scent that smells like money (without actually costing you a fortune), this is it. It also makes a seriously impressive gift, for yourself or someone special, especially while it's on sale. And considering Tom Ford discounts like this don't come around often, it's worth snapping up before it's gone. Explore More Top Headlines"

She recently stepped out for a dinner date with husband Anand Ahuja, grabbing attention in a classic red dress. Her high-fashion look featured a scarlet poplin maxi dress by Khaite, complete with dramatic, loose-flowing quarter sleeves and a plunging V-neckline. The luxe dress made her look both radiant and elegant. Story continues below Elevating the glam factor were Alaïa's heart-shaped torn earrings and a Dior bag. The actress's hair was styled in a bun, with soft flicks sculpting her face and perfectly enhancing the delicate charm of the dress. She looked rose-fresh with a red blush and gold highlighter adding warmth to her features. This comes just a few days after the actress celebrated her 40th birthday with close friends and family at home. For the occasion, Sonam opted for an all-black outfit, featuring a relaxed long-sleeve jersey top paired with a parachute skirt. She accessorised with a metallic cuff, rings, and earrings. Sonam has had quite an eventful year. As the global brand ambassador for Dior, she travelled to Japan for its Pre-Fall 2025 show. She wore two all-Dior looks, one of which was designed by Maria Grazia Chiuri and inspired by Japan's sakura season. She exuded dreamy elegance in a soft pastel dress with a buttery-smooth silhouette, light floral prints, and delicate frills—topped off with a striking black cape for contrast and depth. Story continues below For another outing, she wore a sophisticated double-breasted jacket over a crisp white shirt with visible cuffs, paired with a structured midi skirt. The well-tailored look was complemented by a white Lady Dior handbag and black pointed-toe stilettos, adding to the ensemble's formal appeal. Images: @sonamkapoor/Instagram"

The actress is reviving forgotten trends like capri pants and stealing the spotlight by styling them gracefully. Janhvi's stylist Lakshmi Lehr recently posted pictures of the actress in an all-white ensemble comprising a blouse and capri pants. She looked elegant in a silk-panelled sheer blouse with full sleeves, tucked neatly into her cigarette pants. Story continues below To complete the look, Janhvi wore white closed-toe heels along with earrings and rings, adding to the serene summer vibe. Her hair was styled in glossy romantic waves, and her makeup focused on accentuating her eyes and lips. Sharing the pictures, Lakshmi captioned, “Bringing capris back.” Janhvi's version of the look was more formal, thanks to the silk shirt and heels. However, capris can also be paired with oversized shirts, leather jackets, or crop tops for more casual or edgy outings. Recently, a slew of international celebrities were also spotted wearing capris, signaling that the trend is here to stay this summer. Just last month, Janhvi made jaw-dropping appearances at Cannes, styled by sister Rhea Kapoor. For her debut red carpet look, she stunned in a pink Tarun Tahiliani ensemble featuring a handwoven real tissue skirt and corset. The fabric's hand-crushed texture added dimension, while a signature TT drape lent fluidity to the outfit. Images: @janhvikapoor/Instagram For her second appearance, Janhvi opted for an Anamika Khanna creation. The designer's handle wrote: “@janhvikapoor wears custom @anamikakhanna. in couture. She wears a mix of archival traditional Indian jewels with custom jade and jadau creations.” Story continues below Images: @rheakapoor/Instagram Janhvi also sported classic archival pieces from luxury houses like Yves Saint Laurent, Christian Dior, and Miu Miu."

mov_5D87711FBBA361CADF3EA0F0EA6C3EF4,2025-06-16 07:08:45,bg,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[bg]Звездната сватба на Джеф Безос и Лорън Санчес изглежда ще съответства на бляскавия им начин на живот, като сега е разкрита внушителната цена, която ще заплатят за тържеството.  Смайваща цена за сватбеното тържество във Венеция ще е между 10 и 20 млн.$., твърдят експерти Кунал Мадан, главен изпълнителен директор и основател на DressPreservation.com, и Зоуи Бюк от Hitched.co.uk казаха пред Daily Mail. Цената ще зависи от ексклузивността на мястото, планирането на местоположението и броя на знаменитостите. Миналата година се носеха слухове, че двойката ще проведат церемония на стойност 600 милиона долара в Аспен, Колорадо, през декември, но основателят на Amazon ги определи като ""напълно неверни"". Вместо това сега се твърди, че двойката ще събере известни личности, политици и водещи световни бизнесмени на купон във Венеция, по-късно този месец. Пищното тържество и обширният му списък с гости ще означават засилена охрана, затворени улици, наблюдавано въздушно пространство и силно полицейско присъствие. Суперяхтата на Безос ""Кору"" на стойност 500 милиона долара ще акостира в Сан Базилио - най-близкото място, до което може да се доближи до центъра на града поради крехката му екосистема. Лобно място ще бъде и хотел ""Cipriani"", където ще бъдат настанени много от гостите. Смята се, че Безос, Санчес и техните семейства ще отседнат на яхтата с девет спални, а останалите гости ще бъдат разпределени в близките хотели ""Cipriani"" и ""Aman"". Въпреки че присъствието им не е потвърдено, се носят слухове, че са поканени Орландо Блум и Кейти Пери, Крис Дженър, Ким Кардашиян, Джаред Къшнър и Иванка Тръмп. ""Очаквайте изпълнители, достойни за хедлайнери на фестивал, или планиран списък с международни таланти. С разходите за изпълнители, сценично оборудване, озвучително оборудване и лицензионни разходи, между 3 и 5 милиона долара е разумна цена"", споделя наетият сватбен експерт Кунал Мадан. Колежката му Зоуи Бюк се съгласява с него, обявявайки, че бляскавата двойка определено ще иска някой известен и силно въздействащ за големия си ден - предполагайки, че може би се надяват на изпълнение от Бионсе или Андреа Бочели. ""Очаква се да платите над 2 милиона долара за частен сет от такова голямо име"", обясни Бюк. Лорън е известна със страстта си към скъпите дрехи, като често облича дизайнерски тоалет на червения килим. И експертите очакват, че големият й ден няма да бъде изключение, като се очаква да заложи на няколко визии, които ще сменя през цялата вечер. ""Сватбените couture рокли струват от 500 000 до 1 милион долара, да не говорим за сватбена рокля от висша мода от Dior, Valentino или Elie Saab"", посочва Кунал. Безос и Санчес обявиха публично връзката си през 2019 г. и се сгодиха през май 2023 г. Той й предложи брак с диамантен пръстен за 2,5 милиона долара, толкова голям, че Санчес призна, че ""почти е припаднала"", когато го е видяла."

mov_714531D8B46BDA8F2F5724B25A222A0A,2025-06-16 09:09:09,en,WEB,"  When Dame Mary Quant's miniskirt made its debut on the streets of Chelsea in the mid-1960s, it was as scandalous as it was stylish. The high-rise hemlines weren't just a risqué fashion choice. They were a symbol of youth and freedom, ushering in a new era where politics, gender and social norms were totally re-examined. As the mini marks 60 years since it made its mark on Britain, here's a look back at the skirt's sartorial story throughout the decades. 1910s At the turn of the century, floor-grazing skirts were still favoured by Edwardians. But when the First World War erupted in 1914, practicality trumped fashion, and women adopted lighter fabrics and shorter lengths suitable for work and uniform. After 1915, ankle-length skirts were generally regarded as eveningwear, and for the next 50 years, what was regarded a 'fashionable length' would oscillate and even gave way to an economic theory called the 'hemline index'. 1920s In the 1920s, the flapper hemline hit on or above the knee, which was considered to be avant-garde and quite shocking. It was in 1929 that the economist George Taylor published 'Significant post-war changes in the full-fashioned hosiery industry' where rising hemlines were seen as instrumental in fuelling the booming hosiery market of the 1920s. This contributed to the theory known as the 'hemline index', which posited the fashionable length of a skirt rises with stock prices, and hence falls when the stock market is in trouble. Throughout the Twenties, post-war prosperity gave rise to freer silhouettes like drop waists, and thus knee-skimming skirts became in vogue. 1930s and 1940s At the end of the roaring Twenties however, a long period of recession known as the Great Depression hit the U.S and seeped into the rest of the western world. Throughout the Thirties, in accordance with the hemline index, skirt lengths dropped as fewer people could afford hosiery, and conservative styles were favoured. This wasn't universal however as, in 1939, the beginning of the Second World War meant some skirts did become shorter, reflecting the need for less fabric and the increasing number of women entering the workforce, where they needed ease of movement. 1950s As the Second World War drew to a close, the 'Golden Age of Capitalism' saw an unusual boom in wealth, employment and consumerism in Europe and north America. The voluminous A-line, tea-length skirt became iconic, inspired by Christian Dior's 'New Look,' skirts celebrated domestic opulence and represented a return to traditional and decorative ideas of femininity. Instead of hemlines rising, they widened, allowing for fuller skirts with more fabric to be used. Looking back on the reception of his debut collection, Dior said, “I believe it was due to the fact that I brought back the neglected art of pleasing.” 1960s In the 1960s, the skirt had a new look once again, when British designer Dame Quant launched the 'mini' (named after her car, a Mini Cooper) – a skirt that sat six inches above the knee. Dame Quant wasn't necessarily the inventor of this style however, her French rival André Courrèges introduced a similar style in 1964, while Northumberland-born designer John Bates has also been credited with launching the cut. Extremely short skirts, some as much as eight inches above the knee, became commonplace on the streets of Britain by the mid-Sixties. Young women who wore these short skirts were dubbed “Ya-Ya girls”, a term derived from “yeah, yeah” which was a popular catcall at the time. This shocking trend also aligned with the hemline theory, as Britain's GDP steadily grew, living standards rose and unemployment dropped throughout the decade. 1970s The Seventies oscillated between mini A-lines and long, floaty maxis spurred on by 'flower power' politics. Hemlines fluctuated mirroring the volatile markets of the decade. Tory Prime Minister Edward Heath oversaw an energy crisis, a financial crash and the country's second miners' strike in two years. And while Labour's Harold Wilson got the country back to work, it came at the price of inflation at almost 30 per cent and a bailout from the International Monetary Fund. The return to longer skirts, therefore, was seen by some as a symbolic retreat from the optimism of the swinging Sixties. As Britain faced power cuts, three-day weeks and rising unemployment, youth culture pushed back with romanticism and homemade or second-hand fashion. The 'DIY' aesthetic of patchwork and block-print pieces echoed the growing distrust the public had for consumerism and big business, as vintage fashion became a cost-conscious choice for many. 1980s In the 1980s, shorter skirts became popular again alongside the free market boom spurred on by Ronald Reagan in the U.S. The decade saw the return of the miniskirt, particularly the rara skirt – a short ruffled skirt, which is once again making a comeback today in 2025. The economic despair of the late 1970s however helped fuel the punk movement. Designers like Vivienne Westwood and Malcolm McLaren redefined the skirt entirely – shredding it, slashing it, pairing it with safety pins and anarchic slogans. There was also the more formal miniskirt of the 1980s, linked to the shoulder-padded suits of the time and the rise of women in the boardroom. The short skirt – whether slashed or tailored – became a vivid statement of political and social defiance. 1990s The 1990s saw minimalist slip skirts and relaxed, ankle-skimming lengths return thanks to the grunge movement. The 'less is more' aesthetic dominated the runway, seen in designers like Calvin Klein and Jil Sander, and mirrored by high-street chains like Marks & Spencer. The conservative silhouette arguably reflected the corporate sobriety in a time of economic restraint and recovery. It was less about the skirt itself and more about how it was styled. Flannel shirts were tied over floral midi skirts, while vivid black liner accessorised gothic lace, as an anti-fashion aesthetic born from an era of thrifting and rejection of Eighties excess. By the mid-1990s, with Britain under New Labour, Cool Britannia in full swing and Tony Blair's optimistic economic messaging dominating, skirt lengths started to rise once again...."

林千又昨日拍下自己在國外洗頭、吹頭髮的影片，並在限時動態中寫道：「我洗過最貴的頭在馬爾地夫，洗一次3000（元），還是每天去洗，在國外洗頭基本上都2000（元）起跳，只要我去的地方有髮廊，我都會在外面洗頭，所有的消費從來不是錢的問題，而是感覺問題」。 林千又槓上東區髮廊 爆粗口咆哮
林千又此言一出，讓人聯想到她先前與東區髮廊發生的衝突。 店家當時曝光監視器畫面，拍到林千又在店內咆哮，更爆粗口：「我他X的穿的不是拖鞋、是Dior的鞋子」。 林千又則寫下長文抨擊店家，表示設計師一次處理4個客人，只能找助理幫忙，她洗完頭還一度沒人幫她吹頭髮，讓她氣炸直呼：「你們這樣的服務讓大家來評評理到底是誰有問題？」 高山峰、萁萁都挺店家！ 林千又處境尷尬
林千又與設計師各說各話，雙方並未達成和解共識。 此爭議還意外釣出其他藝人發聲，高山峰留言力挺店家：「其實我跟店老闆還有設計師認識也快十年了，包括我在內還有阿Ben、小可、鐙輝、嘉愛、鮪魚都是固定的客人，如果店家態度有問題，那我們怎可能光顧這麼長時間？ 況且對方比我們這些人紅這麼多」。 黃鐙輝的妻子萁萁也說，自己全家多年來都在該店剪、染、漂髮，「服務什麼都沒有問題。」 她認為若有問題，店長處理一定會顧及現場其他客人的權益，並堅定且有禮地說明情況，呼籲顧客與店家應互相尊重：「不是付錢就是大爺」。 至於林千又和店家誰對誰錯，只能說立場不同，雙方各有支持者。 更多 NOWnews 今日新聞 報導

Real adoption. ⚡ At our Luxury Lunch during Proof of Talk 2025, we brought together senior leaders across industries for an off-stage conversation about where Web3 is headed, and how to get there with clarity, not hype. The setting was private, but the discussion was anything but surface level: Why most token-based loyalty programs fail to retain users What established brands are learning from Layer 1 ecosystems about user engagement How companies are actually accessing grants, and where they get stuck Where regulatory uncertainty is still blocking experimentation It's clear that the next wave of adoption won't be driven by headlines or infrastructure. It will come from focused execution, embedded use cases, and real alignment between incentives and user experience. The luxury sector may seem distant from Web3, but the mindset is aligned: loyalty must be earned, not manufactured. Our thanks to the attendees for joining us and contributing to the conversation: Franck Garnier (Hublot), Laurie Liaume ✨(Lumissoly ✨), Marie LASTES (Guerlain), Ksenia Ternyuk (CELINE), Francesco Pesci (Lancel), Shreya Tyagi (Christian Dior Couture), Kelly Clavière (Maison Ladurée), Damu Winston, MBA, PMP (Amazon), Par Helgosson (PSG), Lily Liu (Solana Foundation), Pedro Lopez-Belmonte Eraso (MetaMinds), Clara Tsao (Filecoin Foundation), Alex Kopferschmitt (Hacken, Blockchain Security Auditor), Simon Hudson (Cheeze, Inc.), Victor Ammer (Ammer Group), Stephan Lutz (BitMEX), Marcel Robert Harmann (THORWallet), Pedro Isaac Lopez Lopez (THORWallet), John Bulich (Powerledger), Jemma Green (Powerledger), Romain Carrere (Aura Blockchain Consortium), David Lake (SingularityNET), Julien Chiche (Luxurynsight) If you're exploring how to integrate Web3 infrastructure into a legacy brand or innovation strategy, these are the conversations that define our work."

mov_9F64D081A2D31598345283B85A9BFFCD,2025-06-16 15:26:47,en,WEB,"  RIP Dutchess Dior & The Frenchman: When Love Turns Toxic By now, most of us have seen the clips — the arguments, the accusations, the tension bubbling over in real-time on IG Live. Zaria Khadejah Carr, known to her followers as Dutchess Dior, and her husband, Shamarcus Jameal Carr — The Frenchman — weren't just another influencer couple. They were the couple. Perfect angles, coordinated fits, smiling kids, and date nights. A curated, filtered love story… until it wasn't. Behind the polished posts was a toxic relationship that played out like a slow-motion car crash — and last week, it finally hit a wall. On June 14, at around 9:30 p.m., police responded to a domestic disturbance call in Twin City, Georgia. There, they found Zaria unconscious. She was pronounced dead shortly after. Shamarcus was gone — along with her car. RIP Dutchess Dior & The Frenchman. Their tragedy shows the cost of toxic relationships. Both could've walked away. Stay mindful life's too precious. Their kids bear the loss. Choose wisely, avoid drama. pic.twitter.com/AZCa2k1gRn — Russell Tinashe (@RussellTinashe) June 16, 2025 An alert was issued, and a few hours later, in Wayne County, deputies spotted the Dodge Challenger. A chase ensued, but it ended in tragedy. Shamarcus died from a self-inflicted gunshot wound before officers could intervene. Just like that, a couple once adored by thousands were both gone. Dutchess Dior and The Frenchman — dead in their 20s and 30s, leaving behind family, followers, and a haunting reminder of how deadly toxic relationships can become. Let's be real for a second: we all love a little drama. Relationship tea on Live, messy breakups, the shade in comments — it's addictive. But sometimes we forget that what we're watching isn't a show. It's real life. And real life doesn't come with a rewind button. Dutchess Dior, a popular social media personality and mother, was tragically killed by her husband in a domestic violence incident that has sparked nationwide shock and outrage. pic.twitter.com/5fBWJnxB3e — The Instigator (@Am_Blujay) June 16, 2025 Zaria and Shamarcus's relationship had all the warning signs. Frequent public arguments. Emotional accusations. Threats. Jealousy masked as love. These aren't just red flags — they're sirens. And when we ignore them, brush them off as “just how some couples are,” we normalize behavior that can escalate into abuse — or worse. For those watching their Live videos unfold in real time, the tension was unmistakable. The final stream, where The Frenchman allegedly threatened Zaria, should've been a wake-up call. But by the time law enforcement got involved, it was too late. If you take one thing from this story, let it be this: Love should never hurt. Not physically. Not emotionally. Not psychologically. If your partner threatens you, belittles you, or controls you — that's not passion. That's poison. Tags ·couple·k*lled·streamer"
mov_CB832BFC0FA416790F85AF12BD9DF597,2025-06-16 15:30:57,en,WEB,"  There's a reason why Expo 2025 Osaka offers a season pass. It's impossible to see and experience everything it has to offer on one trip from a logistical standpoint and due to sensory overload. Many pavilions require advance reservations through lotteries, which makes sense for managing the crowds, but also creates a significant barrier to entrance. Nevertheless, it's an experience like no other. It's hard to capture every thread of narrative and every thoughtful detail in short descriptions, but here's our unofficial selection of the pavilions that pushed the boundaries of exhibit and experience design, and engagement, and left us feeling transported. Inspired by the shape of ammonites, ancient sea creatures that survived multiple extinction periods, the spiral-shaped Pasona Natureverse pavilion celebrates life with the concept of “harmony between nature and technology.” The key exhibit here is the “iPS Heart,” a three-dimensional, moving cardiomyocytes model heart created with living cells using biomaterials and bioengineering. Seeing it in action is wild. This piece alone would be enough to draw a video-recording frenzy to the pavilion, but layered storytelling, guided by Astroyboy and Blackjack, who represent technological and medical innovation, creates a cohesive and inspiring experience. The pavilion opens with a “Tree of Life Evolution” exhibit, which looks like a tree and a blood vessel at the same time, and visually tells the story of past and future. From breakthroughs in surgeries to a futuristic bed that adapts to a person's stats, the following parts of the exhibit talk about the future of everything from medical care to sleep to agriculture. With an impressive lineup of partners, including Lenovo and Motorola, it felt like the best of both trade show and museum experiences, designed to engage and inspire multiple generations. Titled “Theatre of Life,” the multi-layered narrative of the French pavilion sings a hymn to love—loving yourself, loving others, loving the planet. Visitors ascend a ribbon-like ramp clad in reflective pink copper and find themselves in a world filled with beauty and elegance, and striking brand messaging. With the LVMH group a key sponsor, Louis Vuitton turned luxury luggage into an immersive experience, celebrating the brand's craftsmanship through contrasting spaces built entirely from the brand's iconic trunks. In the first room, 84 stacked wardrobe trunks serve as architectural elements, forming a flowing space, and in the second, white Courrier Lozine trunks form a massive kinetic sphere that serves as a canvas for digital artwork. Next, visitors step into the luminous world of Dior, anchored by an entirely white gallery of the brand's designs, infused by the projected images of Dior models. From Rodin's sculptures of hands to immersive light installations, the entire experience prompts you to rethink the connections between time and space, expanding the definition of artistic and brand immersion. The “Little Red Dot,” a nod to the country's nickname symbolizing achievement and resilience despite limited land area, Singapore's “Dream Sphere” is impossible to miss. Enveloped by thousands of recycled disks, it invites attendees to explore the power of dreams while showcasing the city-state's innovation for a sustainable future. Visitors step into a dreamscape filled with paper cutouts depicting the country's ever-changing landscape before moving onto the immersive sound installation and watching the dreams they share light up the spheres in a moment where technology powers true engagement and emotion. A structure that seemingly comes alive is a showstopping first for many visitors. Designed by Tokyo- and Taipei-based studio NOIZ in collaboration with media artist and researcher Yoichi Ochiai, this pavilion is constructed from voxel-like modules clad in a newly developed mirrored membrane that shimmers and moves in response to the environment. And it makes sounds. Inside, digital twins respond to attendees' presence and robotic arms and embedded woofers interact with mirrored surfaces through movement and sound, while remote users can also participate through robotic avatars, redefining authorship. The line to visit the U.S. pavilion extended well under the “Wooden Ring,” which surrounds all the world pavillions at Expo. Splashy displays on both sides of the entrance looped videos of American landscapes and cities, setting the tone for something grand inside. The experience builds on the theme of space exploration as one of humanity's greatest adventures and grounds for international collaboration. Spark, the pavilion's mascot, promotes the theme “Imagine what we can do together” as you move through the exhibit. The experience culminates in a theme-park-like takeoff for the Moon, a definite highlight after multiple videos and static displays, and a chance to see a Lunar sample collected during the Apollo mission. Could Mars be next? Walking up the blue stairs into the rising sun of Japan (and also the setting sun of Spain) is an experience that stands out even in a very visually crowded space of the Expo. Leaning into the idea of the Kuroshio Current connecting the East and the West, the pavilion takes visitors on a journey inside—and across the ocean—telling the stories of pirates, and also oceans as labs for biofuels and renewable energy. Holograms of large pieces of equipment and a bubbling lab display make for engaging and informative visuals. The final space is red-orange, a major contrast to the blue hues, filled with postcards and social media posts, reflecting the vibrancy of Spanish culture, and reminding exhibit designers that sometimes the most impactful design elements are analog. Coming in from the constant rain, visitors appreciated colorful ponchos given out at the Brazil pavilion that celebrate the cycles of life and the country's joyful culture. The blinds would lift on the exterior, revealing a “living environment” filled with inflatable sculptures that move in response to music and light. What starts out as a completely white space soon undergoes dramatic visual transformations, with the sculptures deflating and “dying,” only to experience rebirth soon after. The mood shifts in the next space, filled with large-scale videos of the country's cultural diversity and face-painting activations, enjoyed by kids and adults alike. Authentic coffee adds to the multisensory journey and fuels the adventure to come. Photo credit: Anna Huddleston"

Das ist vielleicht nur ein Nebenjob, aber gerade dort zählt der erste Eindruck.

Ein frisches, freundliches Make-up kann da mehr ausstrahlen als tausend Worte: Offenheit, Ruhe, Verlässlichkeit. Für diesen Arbeitstag habe ich mich für einen Look entschieden, der gepflegt aussieht, ohne überladen zu wirken. Ein klarer Teint, sanfte Kontur, kühle Brauntöne auf den Augen und ein dezenter Lippenstift – zurückhaltend, aber bewusst gewählt.

urn:li:ugcPost:7340416033825927168,2025-06-16 16:32:41,en,LINKEDIN,"  What a journey! After two intense and transformative years, I have just graduated from HEC Paris with a double Master's in Management and Marketing (Programme Grande École). This journey taught me how to think like a strategist and create like a marketer. More importantly, it sharpened my belief in using business as a force for meaningful impact. I leave with more than a degree: a mindset, a mission, and a drive to build things that matter. I had the chance to apply that mindset across real-world projects: - L'Oréal x La Roche-Posay Laboratoire Dermatologique: winning the bootcamp by developing a product concept and launching a 360° campaign for inclusive sun protection - Parfums Christian Dior: creating a Gen Z fragrance concept rooted in emotional connection - ⁠Capgemini Invent (frog): crafting the marketing strategy for Her Third Place, a wellness startup at #StationF, built on community-led growth - ⁠Amazon x DDB: responding to a live agency brief focused on brand perception - ⁠Veepee: designing a full strategy to reconnect the brand with a younger generation - McKinsey France x The Walt Disney Company: solving a real consulting case on the future of entertainment and IP expansion This chapter gave me more than just skills, it gave me perspective and purpose. Grateful for every conversation, challenge, and collaboration that shaped this journey. A heartfelt thanks to my incredible professors, classmates and most importantly to Gachoucha Kretz, PhD and Marion BOUYOU for the support, inspiration and constant push to think bigger. Excited to the next chapter!"

tw_sl_e9cf0e2444d615e9dad7e49a81dfcb38,2025-06-16 17:05:50,en,WEB,"  Mrs Harris Goes to Paris (2002) is a modern mastering of the fairytale genre, its older lead bringing new life to the underdog. Wrapped in a Dior box, it reminds me to have hope in the world. Lesley Manville's 2022 adaption of Mrs Harris Goes to Paris, coming from the 1958 novel of the same name, is a romantic fantasy at its core, a modern-day fairytale. Instead of a stable boy though, we follow a heroine, an elderly English cleaner, as she goes on a journey to Paris not to find herself a prince, but the perfect Dior dress. Mrs Harris is someone who has left her best years behind her according to society and is at an age where starting over seems impossible. Unlike other fairytale heroes, she doesn't have the privilege of being naive. After all, she has breathed in the world's challenges as a working class woman for decades. The only thing that makes her special is her endless love for the world. Every one of us has a Mrs Harris in our lives. The eternally doting, hard-working, compassionate figure who acts as a blanket to anyone who enters their circle. Your real life fairy godmother. They might be your friend, your former teacher or the woman who once listened to your woes on a park bench, it doesn't matter. The beauty of the character is her ability to shift into this person. For me, Mrs Harris is my Granny, a woman of great kindness with an endless appetite for stories. I watch on the screen as Mrs Harris talks in her humble, broad, voice and I see my grandmother taking what she wants, and telling me to do the same. Through redefining the fairytale hero as an older woman, the movie has given new meaning to the kind nature she shows throughout. She is not simply an embodiment of good nature, but someone who makes the active choice to help others at her own peril. Mrs Harris was not a character that I got to meet in my childhood. Instead, I found her when I was sixteen, desperately trying to find my place in the world while going through the throes of teenage angst. It's ironic to think that people would look at me and see an underdog before they saw it in her. Even in Dior, her fantastical world of fashion, she just can't get what she wants. She is put down as a nobody time and time again and the dress she orders, the realisation of her dream, is taken away from her. Her only saviour is Natasha, a young model, and a more traditional underdog.The framing of Natasha as an equal to Mrs Harris is part of what makes the film so revolutionary in its representation of age for me. It tells us that dreams are not something reserved for the young, and that every story is equal and worth telling. It is this that makes the movie a masterclass in the telling of the underdog story, arguably being the best seen in many years. In a world where critics encourage the media to be as dark as reality, Mrs Harris encourages optimism for all. She rejects the way that both her and the rest of the aged working class are traditionally viewed, finally getting her fairytale ending after leading a strike against the society that undervalues her work. Returning to England with her dress, though not the one she wanted, she knows that she has made her husband proud. Once again, she is told that she is a nobody, since she has no proof that her wish came true. Her clients, representing the same society that roots for underdogs, tell her that she isn't someone who is deserving of a happy ending. It is a depressing arc for a feel-good movie but at the same time, I think it's vitally important to understand how age plays into Mrs Harris' role as an underdog in the fairytale world. Her fairytale ending comes not from a stroke of luck, like many other heroes, but as acknowledgement for her caring for others. When she most needs it, she is gifted the dress that she initially chose from the workers of Dior, the real life underdogs that she raised up through the strike. They acknowledged her for recognising their worth, and her journey comes to a close as she cuts herself off from her selfish clients. She did not get a title or a new life, but simply a dress to go to the local club in. The movie ends with her coming down the stairs of the club in the dress, a Cinderella daydream. Everything goes on for her as normal, unlike other characters in the genre who are rewarded with status by their society. Her wearing the dress and getting to be beautiful is a simple message of how our good deeds are recognised. This is likely why the movie is such a comfort for me, as it is for so many others. The movie recognises the plights of people that only we seem to recognise. When Mrs Harris gets confirmation at the beginning of the film that her happily ever after, her husband Eddie, has died, it is not her ending. Instead, it is the commencement of her journey to find herself. Our lives are not as simple as having a singular happily ever after. Mrs Harris Goes to Paris tells us that not all is hopeless. Our love for the world will be rewarded if we recognise ourselves as deserving of it and fight for it, no matter who we are. This movie is the fairytale that we all need to be told, and I implore you to go and watch it if you ever feel invisible in this world.

1lcysav,2025-06-16 17:20:20,en,REDDIT,"  # Too Many Stories to Hold *by Dior Solin* The moment my eyes close— even for a breath— they come: people I've never met, places I've never seen, whole lives spilling through a crack in time. A glance, a blink, a second half-asleep, and already I've lived a thousand moments no one else can see. They flash and fade like fireflies too fast to catch, too many to name. And when I wake, I'm already full— too full— as if my mind has swallowed the night and left no room for where I left my keys or what I meant to say. I forget things, lose threads, drop names, not because I'm careless— but because my mind is always dreaming, even when I'm here. It's not a flaw. It's a flood. And all I can do is cup the beauty I can hold and let the rest be part of the sky. # Reflection – On a Mind That Dreams Too Much to Remember Some minds are wired to receive more than others—more images, more stories, more emotion, more *possibility*. These minds don't fully turn off, even when resting. They drift between states of awareness, collecting dream fragments, intuitions, and impressions that pass through like wind through an open window. For people with this kind of inner life, the external world can feel disjointed or hard to grasp. **Short-term memory can suffer**, not because the mind is weak, but because it's busy weaving invisible worlds. It's not forgetting—it's overflowing. This can be especially common in: * Highly creative, sensitive, or neurodivergent individuals * Trauma survivors whose minds learned to wander for safety..."

Junto a COSAS, presenta a talentos emergentes de distintos rubros, a quienes admira por su ímpetu y la dedicación con la que se han abierto camino en este universo. Por Diego Ochoa Acosta Camille Defago debutó como diseñadora a los 20 años con una firma homónima que no tardó en asociarse con uno de los gigantes del retail peruano. Sin embargo, pronto optó por darle un giro a su carrera, y su ingenio creativo la llevó a apostar por la creación de una plataforma especializada en belleza, pensada para conectar con una comunidad de nicho que confía en su criterio. Así nació La Beauty Bible, un espacio donde comparte consejos y experiencias auténticas, y colabora con voces como Oriana Gallo, Isabella Ossio, Bridget Osterling, Patricia Acevedo y María Ignacia Schwalb: mujeres con conocimiento, estilo propio y una mirada fresca sobre el cuidado personal. El enfoque de Camille no busca ser aspiracional, sino genuino, como el consejo honesto que darías a una amiga. Jimena Zarauz, Marianella Vignati, Isabella Ossio, Alejandra Rejas, Camille Defago, Rafaella Cayo, Alexa Onsihuay, Alessandra Garavito y Carolina Bezerra son frecuentes colaboradoras de las «Beauty Parties», donde aportan sus conocimientos desde sus diversas especialidades. Ha encontrado formas éticas de colaborar con marcas afines, priorizando la confianza sobre lo comercial. Además, organiza las ya conocidas Beauty Parties, encuentros íntimos donde explora nuevas tendencias junto a su audiencia. En esta edición, nos presenta a nuevos nombres que están abriéndose paso en la industria de la belleza, personas que valora por su talento, contribución y mérito propio. Alejandra Rejas (Especialista en uñas) Fundadora de Nailed It, un estudio que prioriza la protección de la uña natural. Luego de dejar su trabajo corporativo, identificó un vacío en el mercado: muchos salones se enfocaban en lo estético, pero no en la salud de las uñas. Entre los servicios más solicitados están el rubber y el gel constructor, que fortalecen y dan un acabado natural. ¿Su consejo clave? No arrancarse el esmalte en casa y usar siempre guantes y productos hidratantes para proteger manos y uñas. Alessandra Garavito (Formuladora cosmética) Creadora de Ella Park, una marca peruana de skincare que nace desde la nostalgia: su fascinación por las cremas comenzó en la refrigeradora de su abuela. Inició su carrera como maquilla-dora, formándose con referentes internacionales, llevando el foco a la piel real, sin filtros. Así empezó a formular productos con propósito, efectividad y alma. Hoy, su marca destaca por ofrecer tratamientos completos en un solo producto, enfocados en resultados reales. La tendencia, asegura, está «en lo local, lo consciente, y en volver a confiar en lo simple pero efectivo: menos pasos, más impacto». Alexa Onsihuay (Maquilladora profesional) Docente en la escuela de Chris Matta, donde, además de formar a nuevos talentos, ha consolidado su carrera desde muy joven. Hace poco fue la encargada de maquillar a la figura de la moda Vivi Wu para su matrimonio. Hoy, propone a sus clientas rostros naturales y luminosos, aunque las nuevas tendencias apuestan por destacar ojos o labios con sombras satinadas, glitter o tonos vibrantes como el rojo y el fucsia. Isabella Ossio, Alejandra Rejas, Carolina Bezerra, Rafaella Cayo y Alexa Onsihuay. Carolina Bezerra (Experta en nanopigmentación de cejas) Fundadora de House of C, un estudio especializado en cejas y pestañas que nació de su experiencia profesional entre Brasil y Perú. Al notar que en el país no se ofrecían técnicas avanzadas ni resultados naturales, viajó a formarse y trajo innovaciones como el nanoblading y la hidratación de labios. Hoy, muchas personas buscan recuperar el aspecto natural de sus cejas y pestañas tras años de seguir modas que resultaron dañinas. Su enfoque es devolverles salud y densidad con técnicas menos invasivas. Carolina recomienda tratarlas como parte del cuidado facial: desmaquillarlas siempre, evitar lápices que bloqueen los folículos y acudir a profesionales capacitados. Isabella Ossio (Coach integral de bienestar) Dedicada al bienestar integral, combina deporte, alimentación y belleza como pilares esenciales del amor propio. Es profesora de distintas disciplinas deportivas, chef y futura maquilladora profesional. Su gusto por el maquillaje nació desde pequeña, influenciada por su familia -su abuela fue la mítica Marissa Guiulfo-, y hoy busca usarlo como una herramienta para elevar la belleza natural de cada persona: «Me encanta ver cómo cambia la energía de alguien al sentirse espectacular». Entre sus favoritos destacan la vitamina C de Skinceuticals, la base Backstage de Dior y los blushes de Patrick Ta. Jimena Zarauz (Fundadora de Siren Sips) Comunicadora de profesión, Jimena es la creadora de la inno-vadora beauty soda peruana, pensada para mujeres que desean verse y sentirse bien sin culpas. Tras notar un vacío en la oferta local de bebidas saludables, especialmente para quienes buscan alternativas a las gaseosas tradicionales, lanzó este producto sin calorías, sin azúcar ni colorantes artificiales, que destaca por sus beneficios para la piel gracias a su fórmula con colágeno, biotina, retinol, vitaminas C, E, B3 y B5.

Marie Antoinette Style will open at the museum in September, and will feature 250 objects including clothing and decorative arts, with some loaned from France's Chateau De Versailles. The exhibition's curator, Sarah Grant, said: “The most fashionable, scrutinised and controversial queen in history, Marie Antoinette's name summons both visions of excess and objects and interiors of great beauty. “The Austrian archduchess-turned queen of France had an enormous impact on European taste and fashion in her own time, creating a distinctive style that now has universal appeal and application. “This exhibition explores that style and the figure at its centre, using a range of exquisite objects belonging to Marie Antoinette, alongside the most beautiful fine and decorative objects that her legacy has inspired. “This is the design legacy of an early modern celebrity and the story of a woman whose power to fascinate has never ebbed. Marie Antoinette's story has been re-told and re-purposed by each successive generation to suit its own ends. “The rare combination of glamour, spectacle and tragedy she presents remains as intoxicating today as it was in the 18th century.” The exhibition will feature richly embellished fragments of court dress, the queen's own silk slippers, and jewels from her private collection. There will also be a number of items which have never left France before, such as the queen's dinner service from the Petit Trianon, her accessories and items from her toilette case. Marie Antoinette Style will look at Antoinette's origins and impact on style from her own time to the present day through audio visual installations and “immersive” curation. A scent experience will re-create the smells of the court, and the perfume favoured by the Antoinette. The exhibition will also feature contemporary clothing including pieces by designers such as Moschino, Dior, Chanel, Erdem, Vivienne Westwood and Valentino – and costumes from  Sofia Coppola's Oscar-winning Marie Antoinette staring Kirsten Dunst. Tickets for the exhibition go on sale on Tuesday and are available from the V&A website."

wi_957AD64B20001F14E91AFD70D7FFF6E4,2025-06-17 02:59:18,en,WEB,"  Xiong Songtao and his daughter exchange ideas on the design of cloisonn handicrafts in Beijing, capital of China in December 2024. (Xinhua) BEIJING, June 14 (Xinhua) -- Not a single air bubble was acceptable. Xiong Songtao's glistening enamel crafts, which employ the Chinese cloisonn technique, a form of intangible cultural heritage (ICH), have attained the precision required for high-end watch dials. Xiong, a third-generation master of Xiong's Enamel, took great pride in this innovation, which has brought acclaim to the family brand both domestically and internationally. The brand secured a global partnership with the Spanish fashion house LOEWE, which celebrated the Chinese Year of the Snake with a collection that pays homage to Chinese cloisonn. The collaboration with Xiong saw LOEWE introduce two sets of cloisonn works: a Nest bag with snake head and lotus cloisonn details as well as necklaces with cloisonn pendants featuring the auspicious snake, monkey and cloud motifs. This project exemplifies a growing trend in which international luxury brands increasingly draw on China's craft heritage, particularly ICH crafts, to navigate the evolving Chinese market. As China marks the 2025 Cultural and Natural Heritage Day on Saturday, the trend also highlights ICH's surge in prominence. Such partnerships create a synergy that, on one hand, helps international brands gain cultural depth and local market insights, while on the other hand, provides ICH brands with enhanced visibility and growth opportunities. TAPPING INTO ICH The collaboration with Xiong was not LOEWE's first tribute to art collections inspired by Chinese cultural heritage. In 2022, the brand presented its holiday collection, which included the Chinese Monochrome collection of bags, inspired by Chinese monochrome ceramics from the Ming (1368-1644) and Qing (1644-1911) dynasties. Other fashion houses are also on the move. The Italian brand Fendi collaborated with artisans from China's Yi ethnic group to create a Baguette bag featuring traditional Yi embroidery and silverwork. French luxury brand Dior incorporated ""Ronghua,"" a velvet flower-making craft that has been practiced since the Tang Dynasty (618-907), into its men's couture knitwear. Additionally, Italian luxury brand Valextra teamed up with Qian Lihuai, an ICH bamboo weaving artist from China, to launch the Valextra Bamboo Iside limited edition last year. ""China is a vast market,"" said Wei Xiang, a professor at the University of Chinese Academy of Social Sciences. He added that it is only natural for international businesses engaged in culture and commerce to accommodate the consumer demand in this market. Consulting firm Bain &Company published an analysis report on the 2024 China luxury goods market on its official website. It said that the Chinese market is expected to recover at a moderate pace in the longer term, driven by the solid fundamentals of China's economy and the growth of its middle class, affirming that ""Despite current difficulties, the Chinese mainland remains an attractive market for luxury brands."" The Chinese mainland boasts over 60 Louis Vuitton stores as listed on the luxury house's official website. The arrival of new fashion house locations signifies a vote of confidence in the market. LOEWE unveiled its flagship store in Shanghai in February, while Balenciaga just held an opening ceremony for its flagship store in Beijing's Sanlitun shopping complex in May. Yet a shift is underway among young Chinese consumers -- especially Gen Zers, the coveted demographic for luxury brands. Increasingly discerning about consumerism, they're prioritizing experiences like travel over material goods. Moreover, they are increasingly embracing homegrown brands, designs, and cultural symbols, a trend now referred to as ""Guochao,"" or ""China-chic."" The crafts listed as the country's ICH represent the most time-honored, best preserved and outstanding artistry and craftsmanship in China. There are over 1,500 ICH projects at the national level across the country. ICH-related products have become increasingly sought-after. According to data from China's leading e-commerce platforms, Taobao and Tmall, in 2023, the annual transaction volume of ICH-related products surpassed the 100-billion-yuan mark, reaching 107.32 billion yuan (about 14.95 billion U.S. dollars), a year-on-year increase of 37.7 percent. MUTUAL OPPORTUNITIES Xiong proudly stated that the necklace pendants they crafted for LOEWE rival the rigorous standards required for watch dials. Silver bent wires with a diameter of just 0.04 millimeters -- about half the thickness of a human hair -- were applied to silver bases filled with enamel paste. Each piece was handmade, taking approximately 20 days to complete. Chinese cloisonn, which was widely produced during the Ming and Qing dynasties, was more broadly used in jewelry and metalware in the ancient royal court. China listed this time-honored craft as a national intangible heritage in 2006. ""The ICH brands, steeped in history and rich in cultural heritage, are more adept at creating culturally unique products. However, their global influence remains limited,"" said Wei, noting that international fashion brands and China's ICH share a complementary relationship that naturally encourages collaboration. ""In contrast, some international fashion houses have over a century of experience in successfully translating cultural value into commercial success. This synergy creates mutual opportunities,"" Wei explained. Xiong came to admire those brands' legacy during his collaborations with elite fashion houses. ""What truly defines these brands,"" he reflected, ""is an ingrained sense of honor -- forged through generations -- a commitment to craftsmanship they hold dear."" The partnership also enables Xiong's Enamel to redefine its brand by expanding beyond traditional art pieces into wearable jewelry, creating a more everyday context that is likely to attract young consumers. Notably, the motifs featured in the LOEWE pendants were designed by Xiong's Gen-Z daughter, a jewelry design graduate, to whom Xiong plans to eventually pass the baton. ""Our craft and technique are superb, and our brand becomes more prominent, and above all, China is getting stronger, with more people coming to love Chinese culture,"" Xiong said in a summary of his insights into the new trend of collaboration. Enditem (Zhou Rui and Zhang Jiaxuan also contributed to the story) This photo taken on July 2023 shows a cloisonn work designed and crafted by Xiong Songtao. (Xinhua)..."

mov_245D05E71BD26E1A68B8D29F449277AE,2025-06-17 05:14:30,en,WEB,"  The world of Formula 1 isn't just about the racetracks; it's also about the big screen! This Monday, New York City witnessed the premiere of F1: The Movie, where Lewis Hamilton was the star of the show. Dressed in a sleek Dior suit, the British driver not only dazzled the attendees but also reaffirmed his crucial role in the production of the film starring Brad Pitt. The film, which promises to be a box office hit, tells the story of a veteran driver coming out of retirement to join the fictional team APX GP. This team, which also features a rookie played by Damson Idris, has been part of several race weekends during the 2023 and 2024 seasons, bringing fiction to an impressively realistic level. Hamilton, who has been a key figure behind the scenes, didn't hesitate to share his experience on the project. According to one of the stars, his role was crucial in maintaining the film's authenticity, ensuring that every detail reflected the true essence of Formula 1. ""Lewis wasn't afraid to point out what wasn't working, "" commented a source close to the production. The movie, which includes scenes inspired by real events, such as the famous crash between Hamilton and Max Verstappen at the 2021 British Grand Prix, has been filmed at various circuits on the F1 calendar. This has allowed the fictional APX GP team to have its own garage in the pit lane, bringing fiction even closer to reality. Lewis Hamilton's presence on the red carpet, alongside Brad Pitt and the film's producer, was the cherry on top following his participation in the Canadian Grand Prix F1 2025. With his unmistakable style and charisma, Lewis proved to be a star not only on the track but also in the world of cinema, leaving everyone eager to see more of this thrilling production."

In a few short minutes, they can spark emotion, reveal character, and wake a collection up. These videos look good and make you feel something. A well-crafted campaign can be as stirring as a song or as memorable as a favorite scene from a movie. In menswear, especially, these films go beyond surface style. That's whether focused on Gen Z fashion or more mature style. They explore who the man is, how he moves, and what he stands for. Whether it's a sharp suit in a surreal set or a knit sweater on a windswept hill, each visual is packed with meaning. Contents Toggle Telling Stories Through StyleFrom Vision to Script: Behind the Creative DirectionCinematic Language & Aesthetic ChoicesCasting Modern MasculinityFashion as SymbolismSet Design & AtmosphereSound, Music & EmotionDistribution: Where the Story Unfolds Telling Stories Through Style PinPhoto: Deposit Photos A good fashion video shows the clothes while giving a message. The best ones stick with you, not because of a logo, but because of a feeling. Brands use campaign films to shape identity, and in menswear, that often means showing the man behind the look. Take BOSS and its clean, motivational tone, or Zegna's quiet moments that blur elegance with nature. They use movement, music, and atmosphere to tell a story that runs deeper than the fabric. The video editor plays a key role here by cutting scenes, setting the pace, and making sure every frame supports the emotion. And it works. The viewer sees a jacket and how it fits into a life. Whether it's rebellion, confidence, or stillness, the story gives the clothes weight. Because in men's fashion, style isn't just worn. It's lived. From Vision to Script: Behind the Creative Direction PinPhoto: Kyle Lotus / Pexels Every strong fashion film starts with a clear point of view. Brands build a concept. That means sketching out moodboards, picking reference films, and shaping a story that fits the season's intent. In menswear, that message often circles around identity, ambition, or attitude. A clean-lined collection might call for minimalist storytelling; something more rugged leans into grit or solitude. Directors, stylists, and editors work together to thread the visuals into a single mood. It's not always literal. Sometimes the concept is abstract with a tone more than a plot. But even then, every shot has purpose. Take Prada's quiet intensity or Versace's glamorous confidence. These aren't accidental vibes. They are decisions. Cinematic Language & Aesthetic Choices PinPhoto: Deposit Photos Style in motion needs the right lens. The way a fashion video is shot, including the angles, lighting, and edits, shapes how we read the clothes. Menswear campaigns play with tone, whether it's sharp and structured or soft and moody. Some brands go clean and minimal, like COS with its neutral palettes and still frames. Others go bold. For example, Balmain leans into high drama with fast cuts and intense lighting. Then there's raw realism, like what you'd see from Wales Bonner. Camera work matters. A slow zoom can build tension. A handheld shot can make it feel personal. Music, color grading, and pace all build the story without a single word. Casting Modern Masculinity PinPhoto: Deposit Photos Who wears the clothes matters just as much as how they're shot. Casting in advertisements goes beyond looks and also focuses on presence. The right face tells the narrative without saying a word. Robert Pattinson brings brooding cool to Dior Men. NBA stars like Draymond Green in BOSS advertisements add ambition and edge. Harris Dickinson's quiet intensity sets the tone for Prada. These choices shape how we see the clothes and the kind of man wearing them. Modern promos don't just cast models...."

There's a quiet timelessness to the feeling it evokes: rooted yet refined, classic yet confidently regal. This colour has been making subtle appearances everywhere: on runways, in interiors, hotels, restaurants, and even in makeup palettes. Consider it a moody plum or a wine-infused purple, something both grounded and enchanting. Like many hues that linger in our memory, this one comes directly from nature. More than just a culinary herb, purple plum has become a visual icon reflecting a shift toward earthy luxury and vegetal sensuality. ١. Purple Plum in Fashion and Jewellery Saint Laurent, Spring 2025 ANTEPRIMA Spring 2025 These rich hues of purple often evoke the intimacy of fall and winter; its warmth pulling us inward. But on the spring and summer runways, it tells a different story. Purple plum seems to be bridging the seasons, engaging our senses in familiar ways. Tory Burch Wave Earrings Bottega Veneta, Small East-West Andiamo Bag In Saint Laurent's Spring collection, the iconic powerhouse suit appears in this tone, showing us everything we need to know about the soft strength of this colour. ANTEPRIMA's sheer, purple design invites a return to brighter natural tones for the rush of daily life, infusing ideas of freedom and connection. And Bottega Veneta's famous East-West Andiamo Bag in this exact shade proves how essential these hues have become in shaping how we dress, thus how we want to feel and move in the world. ٢. Purple Plum in Beauty Courtesy of Rhode Courtesy of Rhode Courtesy of Chanel Courtesy of Dior Courtesy of Fresh Purple plum tones and have always had their place in beauty, creating natural depth and elegance to both everyday and editorial makeup. From eyes to cheeks to lips, the cool, moody hue balances softness with edge. The Dior 5 Couleurs Palette brings a refined mix of purples and neutrals that layer seamlessly for dimensional eye looks. For a bolder statement, Chanel's Ombre Première in 58 Pourpre Brun offers a creamy, deep plum with a satin finish that wears like velvet. On cheeks, the Rhode Pocket Blush in Plum—a cool purple berry—adds a fresh, diffused glow that warms into the skin. And for a subtle tint on the lips, Fresh's Sugar Plum Tinted Lip Balm offers just enough color and hydration, capturing the spirit of purple basil in its most wearable form. ٣. Purple Plum in Interior Design Source: Pinterest Generally, dark purples in interior design carry a legacy of prestige and sensory impact dating back to rare Tyrian dyes of antiquity, where purple signified nobility and power. Today, designers embrace deep, dusty purples for their ability to ground a space with moody intimacy. Berlin-based artists Mike Klar and Kevin Kurz have brought this sensibility into contemporary art and design through installations that blend muted violets with organic textures, making spaces feel both anchored and contemplative. Courtesy of Mike Klar and Kevin Kurz Courtesy of Mike Klar and Kevin Kurz The Minotti Aston Sofa in aubergine velvet, by the late designer Rodolfo Dordoni, embodies the rich, grounded elegance of purple plum. With its deep, dusty plum tone, the sofa introduces mood, texture, and memory. This hue sits between tradition and modernity: a rooted natural tone that recalls regal history, yet feels entirely contemporary in design. Courtesy of Minotti"

He has featured in a recent Apple TV series as well as in a number of works of historical fiction. That is the case in this novel where window shopping and a dress by the couturier feature in the story. Wells tells the story of three friends who reunite in post war Paris. They are Claire, Gina and Margot. Claire is a native French woman and chef. Gina is an American aspiring writer/journalist. Australian Margot is working at Dior's fashion house. All have their struggles, relationships and hopes. Early in the novel, readers learn that Claire was lucky enough to be loaned an apartment above her father's bistro. The mysterious Madam Vaughan has gone away for reasons not initially shared and left Claire to occupy her home. She has also gifted a Dior gown to Claire. The three young women clearly benefit from her generosity. Claire invites her friends to stay with her. Readers then follow them through their lives and will, I think, care about what happens to them. This story is involving and nicely details the characters and their world. This is a story of female friendship that I very much enjoyed. Many thanks to NetGalley and William Morrow for this title. All opinions are my own. Pub date: 20 August 2024"

mov_5CFCA5EE1192093398710944777E6C90,2025-06-17 12:06:40,en,WEB,"  Rachel Zegler unveils a romantic, vintage-inspired look in her June 2025 British Vogue feature. There's a moment in rehearsals when Rachel Zegler, swathed in a diaphanous Dior dress (ribbons fluttering like protest banners), locks eyes with director Jamie Lloyd. The air crackles — less starlet-meets-auteur, more two rebels plotting a coup. This isn't your grandmother's Evita. Lloyd's production, set to ignite the London Palladium this summer, strips Hal Prince's opulent spectacle to its nerve endings. Against a monochrome bleacher set, Zegler's Eva Perón emerges not as a glittering icon but a fighter clawing through Argentina's political trenches. “She's like a diamond-edged hurricane,” Lloyd muses, recalling her audition tape — a YouTube clip of Zegler belting Don't Cry for Me Argentina with a rasp that channels Patti LuPone's steel and Madonna's defiance. Today, in a Thameside garden doubling as their rehearsal studio, Zegler's energy is kinetic. Her Dior ensemble — a ivory tea dress with corset-laced sleeves — contrasts Lloyd's tattooed austerity (shaved head, Calvin Klein denim, Nike Sequoias). The pair dissect Eva's Rainbow Tour number like detectives: “It's not pageantry,” Zegler insists, “it's survival.” Lloyd nods, “Exactly. Every sequin is armor.” The collaboration thrives on irreverence. When Zegler improvised a snarling take on Buenos Aires, Lloyd kept the riff: “That's the punk spirit this score needs.” Her styling follows suit — think Dior's couture rigor (she's a house ambassador) roughed up with Wolford tights and Simone Rocha's knit scarves, a visual metaphor for Evita's duality. Lloyd's trademark minimalism — no chandeliers, just cameras amplifying Zegler's every tremor — mirrors his own journey from Dorset outsider to theatre's enfant terrible. “I used to dress as a mannequin in a costume shop window,” he laughs. Now, his Evita rejects nostalgia, just as Zegler's Maria (West Side Story) rejected ingénue clichés. As the Palladium lights prepare to spotlight Zegler's metamorphosis, one question lingers: In an era of reboots, can radical honesty outshine spectacle? Judging by the goosebumps in rehearsals — yes."

mov_401B05DA7118D97E2508ECBBAC627C39,2025-06-17 13:43:24,en,WEB,"  The social media world has been left stunned and heartbroken following the tragic death of popular influencer Dutchess Dior and her husband, Martin, also known as “The Frenchman,” in what appears to be a chilling case of domestic violence turned fatal. The couple, who recently welcomed a baby together, were well-known on Facebook, where they frequently posted content about parenting, healing, relationships, and self-worth. However, behind the carefully curated content, turmoil was brewing. Just hours before their deaths, Dutchess Dior and Martin engaged in a highly emotional public argument during a Facebook Live session. Viewers watched in disbelief as the confrontation escalated, with accusations of cheating, abuse, and betrayal being thrown from both sides. Tragically, shortly after the livestream ended, Dutchess Dior was found dead. Authorities suspect she was killed by her husband, who then took his own life. The exact cause of death remains under investigation, with unconfirmed reports suggesting either strangulation or gunshot wounds. In the days leading up to the tragedy, Dutchess shared several alarming posts hinting at her fear for her life. “I really don't know what to do, but I need help before I lose my life or freedom. My kids need me,” she wrote. In another post, she raised suspicions of surveillance, saying, “Somebody tell me how this boy is getting all my texts and calls.” The argument that may have triggered the fatal end reportedly stemmed from accusations. Martin claimed Dutchess had cheated on him multiple times — even while he was incarcerated — and alleged that she had exposed him to a sexually transmitted infection. Dutchess, in turn, accused him of ongoing physical abuse, which he did not deny publicly. Their newborn baby, along with Dutchess's older child from a previous relationship, are now left orphaned. Friends and supporters have launched a fundraiser to support the children in the aftermath of the devastating loss. In a related story, social media personality Amah Adoma revealed that a man had been scammed of ₦1.5 million (about 10,000 Ghanaian cedis) after someone used her photos on fake Facebook accounts. The scam, which involved the victim attempting to purchase an item humorously identified as “Opueh,” has added a bizarre twist to an already emotionally charged atmosphere online. With over 30 fake accounts using Amah's identity, the incident also raises renewed concerns about cyber fraud and identity theft on social media platforms. Ironically, Amah noted the incident occurred just a day before her birthday. As investigations continue, many are left grappling with the harsh reality behind seemingly perfect online lives — a reminder of the growing mental health and domestic abuse crises hidden in plain sight. #DutchessDior #DomesticViolence #MurderSuicide #MentalHealthMatters #CyberScamAlert #JusticeForDutchess #SayNoToAbuse Follow Us on Social Media"

Among the stars who graced the runway, Kalyani Chawla stood out with her elegance. As a former Dior executive and now a luxury entrepreneur, her appearance at these Kalyani Chawla en vogue events Gurgaon reminded everyone why she remains one of India's most respected fashion icons. The fashion world came alive in Gurgaon with the latest Kalyani Chawla en vogue events Gurgaon. This special show was part of the Kalyani Chawla Blenders Pride en vogue series that celebrates India's top style icons. Kalyani Chawla's Elegant Runway Moment At this Kalyani Chawla en vogue event Gurgaon, all eyes were on Kalyani. She walked the runway in a stunning dress, one of Rohit Bal's signature designs. The outfit was a tribute to Bal's love for motifs. Unlike many celebrities who rely on dramatic poses, Kalyani's walk was all about quiet confidence and grace. This wasn't just another fashion moment. Infact it was Kalyani Chawla en vogue events Gurgaon at their finest. Her presence added a touch of understated glamour to the show. Tribute to Rohit Bal The Kalyani Chawla Blenders Pride en vogue was a homage to legendary designer Rohit Bal. Over 100 personalities from Bollywood and fashion walked the runway, each representing a chapter of Bal's incredible journey. Kashmiri influences in decor, music, and food celebrated Bal's roots. Giant screens displayed his most iconic designs. Kalyani Chawla, with her deep understanding of luxury fashion, fits perfectly into this legacy celebration. This Kalyani Chawla en vogue events Gurgaon wasn't just about fashion. It was about honoring a designer who shaped India's style for years. Kalyani's Fashion Journey What makes Kalyani Chawla en vogue events so special? Her career tells the story: Luxury Background: As former VP of Dior India, she helped shape the brand's presence in the country. Entrepreneurial Spirit: Now running her luxury silverware brand, Rezon, she bridges fashion and lifestyle. Timeless Style: Whether in Rohit Bal's designs or her creations, she always looks effortlessly chic. Her walk wasn't just about modeling, and it was about honoring a designer she deeply admired. Why Blenders Pride Events Stand Out The Blenders Pride fashion events are more than just fashion show; they'ree cultural experiences. This year's tour: Blended fashion with culture, like the Kashmiri feast served at the Gurgaon show. Celebrated legacy, keeping Rohit Bal's influence alive. Brought together the best, from designers like JJ Valaya to stars like Sonam Kapoor. Kalyani Chawla Blenders Pride en Vogue added depth to this mix, proving that authentic style is about substance, not just trends. A Pan-India Celebration of Fashion While Gurgaon honored Rohit Bal, other Blenders Pride fashion events across India brought their unique flair to the stage. In Chandigarh, the crowd witnessed Kanika Goyal's bold street-luxe collection, lit up by Jacqueline Fernandez's show-stopping walk. The mix of oversized jackets, graffiti art, and live music turned the night into a lively street-style celebration. Mumbai was next, where designer Tarun Tahiliani created a floating runway show. Models walked on a glass platform and Bollywood stars like Manushi Chhillar and Tiger Shroff added star power. Vizag gave the event a futuristic spin. The Bloni label presented tech-fashion outfits using LED lights, reflecting fabrics, and experimental silhouettes. Actress Tamannaah Bhatia led the finale, making it a memorable chapter in the Blenders Pride fashion events calendar. In Guwahati, Nitin Bal Chauhan, NoughtOne by Abhishek Paatni, and Pawan Sachdeva redefined the runway with their fearless, boundary-breaking styles. A live rap performance kept the energy high, making it one of the most talked-about shows of the tour. This wide range of styles and performances turned the event into a true pan-India celebration of fashion. That's when the flavors of each city started to come to the runway as young designers, fashion students and fashion lovers alike got a chance to see some exciting new trends, creating memorable runway moments. The Kalyani Chawla en vogue events Gurgaon were a part of this larger celebration, showing how one event can reflect the spirit of an entire country. Rohit Bal: A Timeless Icon..."

After an incredible journey, I'm proud to share that I've officially graduated from HEC Paris, Master in Marketing! This past year has been a whirlwind of creativity, strategy, and growth — and I've had the chance to work on unforgettable real-world projects with iconic brands: Parfums Christian Dior – Designed a Gen Z fragrance collection and promotional plan. L'Oréal x La Roche-Posay USA Bootcamp – Built a product concept and 360° campaign for next-gen UV protection. Veepee – Developed e-commerce strategies to engage younger audiences. McKinsey & Company – Crafted consulting strategies for platform growth. DDB x Amazon – Led a social media strategy to spotlight Amazon's sustainability efforts. Kering x DoDo Jewels – Selected as finalists to present a 360° market expansion strategy for DoDo Jewels. Cartier – Created storytelling and launch strategy for Cartier Home new collection. Our team won 1st place🥇 and was invited to a private Cartier piano concert. Another highlight: our London learning expedition, where we visited Burberry, Cartier, and Warner Bros. Discovery HQs, and connected with the HEC UK Alumni House. I was deeply inspired by the powerful voices of women leaders in marketing and luxury. To my incredible marketing crew — thanks for all the brainstorms, good vibes, and late-night laughs. And to our amazing program directors Gachoucha Kretz, PhD and Marion BOUYOU — thank you for crafting a journey that was both challenging and deeply rewarding. When I enrolled in this program, I never expected to grow this much — but it truly prepared me to become a better marketing leader, with stronger creativity, strategic thinking, and empathy. I'm thrilled to share my next chapter: I'll be joining The Estée Lauder Companies Inc. Presidential Management Scholar Program in China, working in the Marketing department of Le Labo Fragrances — a brand I deeply admire for its soul, storytelling, and slow beauty philosophy.

mov_9E71B41DF1B82956D9C12CE0A1B7C8F4,2025-06-17 16:01:39,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]El mundial de Fórmula 1 tiene un indiscutible rey de estilo que es, por supuesto, Lewis Hamilton. Lo que pasa es que cuando sale de las pistas, al británico no se le cae la corona, ni siquiera rodeado de la realeza de Hollywood. El siete veces campeón del mundo de Fórmula 1 se ha rodeado de estrellas en el estreno de la película F1, el blockbuster a motor protagonizado por Brad Pitt y Damson Idris, y por si ser productor y asesor no fuera suficiente, también ha llegado a la alfombra dispuesto a ser el hombre mejor vestido (SPOILER: lo ha conseguido). Más sobre moda ModaLa Semana de la Moda de Londres pasa por horas bajas y, precisamente por eso, es más necesario que nunca fijarse en el trabajo de la diseñadora londinense, que engloba todo lo bueno que puede ofrecer la moda británica. ModaEl nuevo Royal Oak de Justin Bieber mantiene a flote la última tendencia relojera entre los que más saben de moda. Por un momento Hamilton ha salido del paddock para celebrar que el mundo del motor llega a la gran pantalla. La película de Joseph Kosinski ha fusionado el universo de los monoplazas con el séptimo arte como nunca antes, utilizando los Grandes Premios como escenario. La escudería APXGP se sumó como una más en las pistas durante el año pasado, mientras un elenco de altura (Brad Pitt, Damson Idris, Javier Bardem…) se fusionaba con los pilotos profesionales, que se interpretan a si mismos en el largometraje. Sir Lewis Hamilton, sin embargo, tenía un papel especial, porque el británico se ha adentrado en el mundo del cine como productor de la película y con una posición esencial como asesor profesional. A escasos días de que la película llegue por fin a las salas, el reparto y las estrellas de la Fórmula 1 se han reunido en un estreno mundial en Nueva York. Allí, sobre una alfombra negra, los monos de carreras se han convertido en elegantes trajes y, por mucho que lo intenten todos, ninguno es capaz de llegar al nivel de Lewis Hamilton. El británico ha sido el mayor exponente de la elegancia en el estreno, aunque tampoco podemos pasar por alto a los tres actores principales de la película, no es por nada que estos cuatro iconos de la cultura pop son . La alfombra negra de la película F1 fue un desfile de cómo hacer las cosas bien. Brad Pitt fue el más clásico con un esmoquin azul con solapas negras, aunque lo relajó con una camisa blanca ligeramente desabotonada. El segundo en clasicismo fue Javier Bardem, con un total look negro de Zegna, con chaqueta cuello mao y una chapa que utilizó para denunciar el genocidio que se está llevando a cabo en Gaza. En un radical salto de modernidad, Damson Idris, embajador de Tommy Hilfiger, optó por un tres piezas de raya diplomática y por tradicional que parezca, el simple hecho de eliminar la camisa y jugar con las proporciones de las piezas le da una vuelta de tuerca a lo que ya conocemos. Y una vez saltadas las formalidades, llegamos a la verdadera estrella de esa alfombra, Lewis Hamilton y su traje de Dior Men. El piloto y su estilista, Eric Mcneal, han construido un armario capaz de colocar a Hamilton como el hombre mejor vestido semana tras semana y en los eventos más exclusivos del planeta. Si en la MET Gala ya demostró ser un verdadero caballero blanco, en el estreno de F1 ha utilizado a una infalible fórmula de elegancia que siempre funciona (mezclar blanco y negro) y nos recuerda a ese increíble look total white en las escaleras del Museo Metropolitano de Nueva York. El traje de Dior Men que vestía Lewis Hamilton en la premiere de F1, perteneciente a la última colección de Kim Jones para la maison, es una muestra de sastrería moderna y extremadamente sofisticada. El pantalón negro y ancho iba acompañado de una americana cruzada blanca, sin solapas y ajustada en la cintura. Es un ejemplo de sastrería fina, en la que cada detalle cuenta, desde el discreto cuello a las pinzas laterales. Los diamantes del broche y las joyas del piloto británico cierran a golpe de destello otro look impecable. Sir Lewis Hamilton en la premiere de F1, en el paddock y en las pistas se ha ganado a pulso el título de caballero. Aquí de hecho le elevamos a rey del estilo allá donde va.

mov_951B55413CB2C7EEB650BBA1801FD9B1,2025-06-17 16:09:42,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]El magnate estadounidense contraerá matrimonio el próximo 24 de junio con la periodista Lauren Sánchez La ciudad de los canales más famosa del mundo, conocida por su belleza serena y su herencia cultural inigualable, se prepara para recibir uno de los eventos más comentados del año: la boda simbólica de Jeff Bezos, fundador de Amazon, y la periodista Lauren Sánchez. Del 24 al 26 de junio, Venecia será escenario de una celebración que, lejos de pasar desapercibida, ha suscitado tanto admiración como controversia. El enlace, que contará con una duración de tres días, ha sido confiado a los exclusivos organizadores Lanza & Baucina. Detrás de este nombre discreto se encuentran tres primos de sangre azul: el príncipe Antonio Licata di Baucina y los condes Riccardo y Aleramo Lanza. Estos aristócratas han forjado una reputación intachable como arquitectos de eventos irrepetibles, como la boda de George Clooney y Amal Alamuddin en 2014, también en Venecia. Ahora, una década después, regresan a la ciudad flotante para encargarse de un acontecimiento aún más ambicioso. El compromiso entre Bezos, de 61 años, y Sánchez, de 55, fue anunciado en mayo de 2023 a bordo del “Koru”, el lujoso yate del magnate, en una escena de película coronada con un anillo de 30 quilates. Desde entonces, las expectativas sobre el evento no han hecho más que crecer. Para ello, el equipo de Lanza & Baucina ha puesto en marcha una logística de alta precisión: desde la reserva de cinco de los hoteles más prestigiosos de la ciudad —Cipriani, Aman, Danieli, St. Regis y Gritti Palace— hasta la planificación de traslados en taxis acuáticos y amarres especiales para cinco megayates, entre ellos el propio Koru, valorado en más de 460 millones de euros. Se estima que más de 250 invitados asistirán al enlace, entre ellos personalidades del calibre de Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry, Eva Longoria, Oprah Winfrey, Barbra Streisand, Ivanka Trump y Lady Gaga. Uno de los escenarios más probables para la ceremonia es la isla de San Giorgio Maggiore, un enclave que ofrece la combinación perfecta de privacidad, elegancia y vistas panorámicas. Esta localización permitiría blindar el evento y evitar las miradas indiscretas, sin renunciar al encanto veneciano. Un evento rodeado de polémica Sin embargo, no todo está siendo de color de rosa para los novios. La masificación turística en Europa comenzó su auge en esta ciudad italiana, que desde hace varias décadas ve como pierde su encanto natural para convertirse en un parque temático exclusivo para sus visitantes. Por ello, desde hace semanas, algunos sectores de la ciudadanía han manifestado su descontento ante lo que consideran una invasión elitista de su ciudad. El colectivo “No Space For Bezos” ha desplegado pancartas con mensajes de rechazo en puntos estratégicos como el Puente de Rialto o el campanario de San Giorgio, denunciando que Venecia “no está en venta” y criticando que la ciudad se esté convirtiendo en el patio de recreo de los millonarios. “Venecia convertida en decorado de oligarcas”, defienden en su denuncia. Los activistas han anunciado una protesta durante los días del enlace, con acciones que van desde bloquear el acceso por vía marítima con botes hinchables hasta formar barreras humanas en los accesos terrestres. “Haremos que se les atragante la tarta nupcial, iremos al asalto y nos tiraremos al canal si hace falta”, han advertido, asegurando que harán todo lo posible por impedir que la ceremonia transcurra con normalidad. Según sus declaraciones, no se trata solo de una cuestión económica, sino de una batalla simbólica por preservar la esencia de una ciudad que, sienten, está siendo desnaturalizada. “Será una protesta colorida y pacífica. Impediremos el acceso a la iglesia por mar con botes hinchables y barcas, y por tierra con nuestros cuerpos. Venecia no está en venta ni se alquila. Viene con cinco mega yates atracados en cinco lugares distintos, ocupa hoteles, taxis, usa la ciudad como si fuera su sala de eventos. Esta es una batalla por la dignidad de la ciudad. No queremos que Venecia se recuerde como una ciudad postiza que hace de escaparate, sino como una ciudad que se opone a los oligarcas“, apuntan los manifestantes. Lujo, discreción y un toque de cine Tras disfrutar de unas despedidas de soltero a lo grande por Europa, —Bezos en Madrid y Sánchez en París—, los novios se preparan para su gran día. En cuanto a la novia, se especula que podría lucir hasta 27 atuendos durante las celebraciones, siendo Oscar de la Renta el favorito para el vestido nupcial. Otras firmas de alta costura como Dior, Dolce & Gabbana y Valentino también podrían estar involucradas en la selección de vestuario, lo que convierte al evento en una pasarela de lujo paralela. El enlace legal ya se habría registrado previamente en Estados Unidos, por lo que la ceremonia en Venecia será de carácter simbólico. Aun así, se espera que cada detalle esté orquestado con un nivel de sofisticación digno de una superproducción de Hollywood."

The body of Dutchess Dior, whose real name is Zaria Khadejah Carr, was discovered by law enforcement around 9:30 p.m. on June 14, per Fox 54 News. Police were called to a house on the 100 block of 5th Avenue in Twin City, Ga., after receiving a call about a domestic disturbance. Officers from the Twin City Police Department, Emanuel County Sheriff's Office, and Emanuel County EMS arrived on the scene only to find Zaria unconscious. She was later pronounced dead. Zaria's 2021 Dodge Challenger was missing, along with her husband, whose birth name is Shamarcus Jameal Carr. Article continues below advertisement Where is Shamarcus Jameal Carr now? Authorities immediately put out an alert for Zaria's vehicle. Less than two hours after Zaria died, her car was found in Wayne County. When deputies attempted to approach the vehicle, they discovered Shamarcus's lifeless body. He was transported to a hospital but died from an apparent self-inflicted gunshot wound. Their deaths are being investigated. Article continues below advertisement Author Toy Styles broke down the original Facebook Live on her TikTok. According to her, Zaria was a corrections officer who met Shamarcus when he was in prison. After he got out, Shamarcus moved in with Zaria and her son. She then got pregnant, and the couple married. But their relationship was apparently very tumultuous. The Facebook Live was centered on Shamarcus's accusations that not only was Zaria cheating on him, but she also put a spell on him that negatively impacted his finances. Article continues below advertisement Shamarcus admitted on the FB Live that he had previously cheated on Zaria. The couple goes back and forth, accusing each other of infidelity. This goes on for an hour until Shamarcus says this was the kind of behavior that gets someone ""beat,"" while holding a knife. ""If I get off this Live, you ain't gonna make it out the door,"" he said. Styles believes that things got deadly serious when Zaria said she was going to tell everyone about someone named Oodie. Immediately after Zaria dropped that name, Shamarcus threatened to kill her. In response to that, she promised to ""spill the tea"" about Oodie another time. The Facebook Live ended at that moment. If you or someone you know is experiencing domestic violence, call the National Domestic Violence Hotline at 1-800-799-7233."

It's where luxury giants like Louis Vuitton, Dior, and Hermès stand alongside high-street favourites such as Zara and COS. ""Pavilion Kuala Lumpur has something for every kind of shopper,"" Choo says. ""You can spend £30 on a shirt or thousands on a designer dress. It's all there."" For fashion that reflects Malaysia's spirit, Choo suggests seeking out homegrown labels. He's a fan of Sembonia for handbags, Ms. Read for size-inclusive fashion, and Fipper, a local brand known for its rainbow array of rubber flip-flops. Across the road, The Starhill offers a more refined retail experience. ""It's one of my favourite places to shop,"" Choo says. ""They even have the world's biggest watch gallery."" Address: 168, Jln Bukit Bintang, Bukit Bintang, 55100 Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur Operating hours: 10 AM to 10 PM, opens daily Where to go for flavours that tell a story If retail therapy leaves you craving comfort food, head just five minutes away by taxi to Petaling Street in the heart of Chinatown. It's a sensory overload—in the best way—of sizzling woks, fragrant spices, and colourful market stalls. Here, Kuala Lumpur's rich cultural blend shines in every bite. Choo's must-try dishes? ""Char kway teow, Hainanese chicken rice, nasi lemak , roti canai, and nasi kandar ,"" he lists with delight. ""I love them all."" For dessert, he encourages adventurous palates to try durian, Malaysia's infamous 'king of fruits.' ""Some people say it smells like cheese,"" he laughs. ""But you can't take it back to the hotel—it's banned because the smell is so strong!"" Address: Jalan Petaling, City Centre, 50000 Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur Operating hours: 10 AM to 10 PM, opens daily Where to stop by for bespoke fashion To truly dress the part, Choo recommends Lord's Tailor, a KL institution crafting custom suits for Malaysia's most stylish since 1974. ""They've been making my clothes since the '90s,"" Choo says proudly. ""When I travel, they create all my outfits—daywear and evening wear. They're incredibly fast and skilled."" Founded by Robert Loh, who trained in London, the tailor shop offers top-quality bespoke craftsmanship with prices starting at around RM3,000. With their own in-house team and factory, fittings on Monday can yield a finished suit by Thursday. ""It depends on the fabric,"" Choo notes. ""If you choose Italian fabric, it can go up to RM10,000. But the workmanship is always perfect.""

""Batik is painted by hand using wax to create beautiful patterns,"" he explains. ""Songket is woven with gold or silver thread—it's more expensive because it takes a long time to make."" The complex includes a museum, workshops, and a boutique selling handcrafted garments and accessories. ""I often wear songket to my birthday celebrations,"" Choo shares. ""One of my students designs with it."" Address: Jalan Raja Chulan, Kuala Lumpur, 50450 Kuala Lumpur, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur Operating hours: 9 AM to 6.30 PM, opens daily Where to go for a serene stroll in the city Amid the buzz of the city, KLCC Park offers a peaceful green escape. Framed by towering skyscrapers and located just beneath the Petronas Towers, it's a lush oasis with jogging tracks, water features, and a charming lake.

9f41d7d4f2b097bba657728edc28cc92,2025-06-18 04:09:00,en,WEB,"  Dior Sauvage The opening of Dior Sauvage greets you with a wash of bergamot so vague it fades almost as quickly as it appears—a polite yet uninspired overture that lacks any memorable spark. As it evolves, a robust flicker of pepper emerges, intertwined with a softer echo of citrus. This isn't your run-of-the-mill pepper note, but a layered, almost tactile peppercorn accord that hints at green stalks and spicy warmth. Yet, for all its rugged masculinity, it never quite finds its moment of sweetness or refinement. There is no gilded elegance here—only a straightforward, uncompromising boldness that, while pleasant in passing, ultimately leaves little desire to revisit. Dior Sauvage Elixir At first spray, Sauvage Elixir assaults the senses with an unusually sharp union of pungent pepper and licorice—an abrasive duet that, frankly, repels rather than intrigues. I found myself recoiling from its acrid intensity. Yet, as the scent settles and time weaves its alchemy, a dramatic transformation unfolds. The once-harsh top notes soften, giving way to a rich, dry warmth that feels unapologetically masculine—an “alpha” male in olfactory form. Subtle threads of sweetness begin to seep through, delicate but undeniable, lending a surprising lift without diluting its raw strength. In its perfected drydown, Sauvage Elixir recalls the noble spirit of the original Sauvage, yet surpasses it with deeper complexity and a more sophisticated finish—no longer a jarring intrusion, but a masterful crescendo of spice and warmth. Sauvage: 3/10 Sauvage Elixir: 5/10"

When politics and philanthropy collide in a spectacular fashion, we witness much-talked-about unions, something Huma Abedin and Alexander Soros are currently making headlines for.Huma Abedin, a longtime aide to Hillary Clinton, and Alexander 'Alex' Soros, the son of billionaire philanthropist George Soros, got hitched over the weekend in a high-profile wedding that brought together some of the biggest names in politics, media, and society.The couple exchanged vows at the Soros family's sprawling estate in the Hamptons, marking a union that blended personal joy with public attention – so much so, that the newly married couple are being touted as the next 'George and Amal Clooney' for their blend of influence, glamour, and shared commitment to progressive causes. Huma and Alex: A love story of politics, philanthropy, and star-studded glamour A seasoned political aide with deep ties to the Democratic Party, Abedin served as a top adviser to Hillary Clinton across various capacities, including during her tenure as the US Secretary of State and in her presidential campaigns.

Their relationship, blossoming from a chance meeting to a lavish wedding this June, has captivated public attention. The Age Gap: A modern power couple At 47, Abedin brings decades of experience in political service, having worked closely with Hillary Clinton across various capacities. Soros, 38, is the second youngest son of George Soros and serves as the chairman of the Open Society Foundations. Their nine-year age difference has sparked discussions, but their shared commitment to progressive causes and public service has been the cornerstone of their relationship. From meetings to engagement Abedin and Soros met in the fall of 2023 at a mutual friend's birthday party, where they quickly discovered shared interests in politics and community service. Their connection deepened over time, leading to an engagement in May 2024.

He's speaking with us from his bedroom in New York, sitting down following his digital cover shoot for Schön! 48 dressed in Lacoste . He's holding his phone vertically and, in a way, it feels like stepping into one of his vlogs — intimate, candid, and full of insight. “The modelling industry is known to be quite serious and exclusive,” he shares. “I thought I could put a twist on it and make it kind of fun; showing the ins and outs of what it's actually like to be a model. And that was the best decision I've ever made!” At just 22, the Gloucester-born talent is making waves both on the runway and online and he's about to take on the big screen as well. Harper first caught the spotlight on TikTok, where he began posting behind-the-scenes footage of life as a working fashion model. One of his most viral videos, in which he demonstrates how to perfect the model face, has racked up over 50 million views. It's surprising to learn that Harper's first two years in the industry were marked by scarce work. After moving to London post-pandemic to attend drama school, he began reaching out to modelling agencies to gain exposure. Though he eventually signed with one, nothing really took off until he met his current agent, Patrick Egbon-Marshall, at a party. “Patrick completely changed my life! The big shift was having someone believing in me and pushing as hard as they could for me,” he explains. Soon after, Harper was sent to Japan to develop his career, and began documenting his modelling journey on social media. He's well aware that good looks alone aren't always enough to make it in the industry. “There are so many top boys in the industry that don't have Instagram. If you look that good, you don't need anything else, but some of us need social media!” he laughs. That self-deprecating British humour is part of what draws people to Harper's content. His authenticity is a key ingredient in his connection with followers. From job bookings and billboard sightings to attending the Academy Awards, his excitement is palpable. “Honestly I couldn't believe I was there! I'm from a very small town in the UK, this kind of industry was very foreign to me, to my family,” he says. “But for some reason, I knew I was going to do something in this line of work. I don't know how, but I always knew, and I'm so glad I trusted my gut.” top. Ernest W. Baker rings throughout. Calum's own opposite suit. Bode shirt. Hanro shoes. Prada top.

A popular influencer and former correctional officer Dutchess Dior was strangled to death by her husband, Shamarcus Jameal Carr in the course of a Facebook live session. Moments later, Shamarcus reportedly took his own life, bringing their tragic story to a harrowing end. Dutchess Dior, whose real name is Zaria Khadijah Carr, was a correctional officer in a U.S. prison where she first met Shamarcus, popularly known as “The Frenchman” while he was an inmate. After his release, the two entered into a romantic relationship and later married. Dior already had a son from a previous relationship, and she later gave birth to a daughter with Shamarcus. On the eve of the tragedy, Shamarcus went live on Facebook to expose a torrent of deeply personal and disturbing details about their relationship. READ ALSO: Dutchess Dior unalived by her husband He confessed to infidelity, domestic abuse, and alleged that Dior had cheated with one of his friends. He claimed they both had contracted STDs and recounted a terrifying incident where Dior reportedly ran naked from their home to a police station to escape his violence. During the final moments of the live stream, Shamarcus allowed Dior to speak. She ended her segment with a cryptic remark: “Oh, and I ain't even told them about Oudie.” His immediate response was “And if you do, you're going to kill you”. The Facebook live abruptly ended, and hours later, news broke that Dior had been murdered by Shamarcus, who then died by suicide. The couple had just welcomed a newborn daughter days before the tragedy. READ ALSO: Hospital worker jailed for kissing patient 9 months after he arrived UK"

The survey results highlight key challenges and opportunities in ecommerce fraud prevention and its strategic role in driving profitable growth and elevating the customer experience. As global ecommerce sales are projected to rise to nearly $8 trillion by 2028 (eMarketer), the sophistication of fraud continues to grow alongside it. Merchants lose as much as $448 billion annually due to payment fraud, false declines, and returns and refund abuse. At Ascend 2025 in North America, Riskified gathered more than 130 professionals from across the ecommerce ecosystem, including merchants representing approximately $1T in annual ecommerce transaction volume. Live polling conducted onsite captured how the ecommerce industry is responding to current challenges: When asked to identify their biggest challenge in optimizing customer experience while preventing fraud, 85% of respondents cited the need to reduce friction for good customers without increasing fraud risk - underscoring the complexity of balancing automation, manual review, and customer journey consistency. Nearly half (47%) of respondents estimate that up to 5% of legitimate customer orders are falsely declined. For the respondents, a 5% false decline rate equates to approximately $50 billion in lost revenue that, with the right fraud management approach, can instead be converted into topline growth. Approximately 54% of respondents selected “initial checkout and/or purchase flow” as the area that offers the greatest opportunity for improvement in fraud prevention, signaling a focus on reducing friction and risk at this critical point in the customer journey. These results underscore discussions at Ascend 2025, where speakers from Amazon, Macy's, Super.com, Christian Dior, Rue Gilt Groupe, Appriss Retail, Primer, Ethoca, and others presented cutting-edge strategies combining AI, data science, and cross-functional and cross-industry collaboration to turn fraud prevention into a strategic lever for business growth. To empower merchants to meet escalating challenges head on, Riskified showcased its newest lineup of AI-first tech designed to combat the most sophisticated fraud and policy abuses including Adaptive Checkout, Policy Protect, and Dispute Resolve. “Fraud isn't a back-office problem anymore — it's a front-line business decision,” said Jeff Otto, Chief Marketing Officer, Riskified. “This survey confirms that the most successful companies are those that treat fraud strategy as a key enabler for growth, conversion, and customer trust.” Riskified's Ascend 2025 North America Summit also featured industry roundtables focused on vertical-specific risks including electronics, fashion, remittance, footwear, omnichannel retail, travel, and gift cards — fostering collaboration and practical solutions among peers.

The survey results highlight key challenges and opportunities in ecommerce fraud prevention and its strategic role in driving profitable growth and elevating the customer experience. As global ecommerce sales are projected to rise to nearly $8 trillion by 2028 (eMarketer), the sophistication of fraud continues to grow alongside it. Merchants lose as much as $448 billion annually due to payment fraud, false declines, and returns and refund abuse. At Ascend 2025 in North America, Riskified gathered more than 130 professionals from across the ecommerce ecosystem, including merchants representing approximately $1T in annual ecommerce transaction volume. Live polling conducted onsite captured how the ecommerce industry is responding to current challenges: When asked to identify their biggest challenge in optimizing customer experience while preventing fraud, 85% of respondents cited the need to reduce friction for good customers without increasing fraud risk - underscoring the complexity of balancing automation, manual review, and customer journey consistency. Nearly half (47%) of respondents estimate that up to 5% of legitimate customer orders are falsely declined. For the respondents, a 5% false decline rate equates to approximately $50 billion in lost revenue that, with the right fraud management approach, can instead be converted into topline growth. Approximately 54% of respondents selected ""initial checkout and/or purchase flow"" as the area that offers the greatest opportunity for improvement in fraud prevention, signaling a focus on reducing friction and risk at this critical point in the customer journey. These results underscore discussions at Ascend 2025, where speakers from Amazon, Macy's, Super.com, Christian Dior, Rue Gilt Groupe, Appriss Retail, Primer, Ethoca, and others presented cutting-edge strategies combining AI, data science, and cross-functional and cross-industry collaboration to turn fraud prevention into a strategic lever for business growth. To empower merchants to meet escalating challenges head on, Riskified showcased its newest lineup of AI-first tech designed to combat the most sophisticated fraud and policy abuses including Adaptive Checkout, Policy Protect, and Dispute Resolve. ""Fraud isn't a back-office problem anymore — it's a front-line business decision,"" said Jeff Otto, Chief Marketing Officer, Riskified. ""This survey confirms that the most successful companies are those that treat fraud strategy as a key enabler for growth, conversion, and customer trust.""

tw_sl_b3b24f0875afa80c742df961ac48e2ff,2025-06-18 13:05:03,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Están MUY de moda Me considero una fanática absoluta de las camisetas con mensaje, una prenda que me acompaña desde siempre y que ha evolucionado en mis diferentes etapas estilísticas. Todo empezó de pequeña, cuando coleccionaba las camisetas de Hard Rock Cafe de diferentes ciudades. Después, tuve una etapa en la adolescencia en la que llevaba sin parar camisetas de mis grupos de música favoritos como Guns N' Roses o The Killers. En cada viaje suelo comprar alguna camiseta a modo de souvenir, la más preciada de mi armario; la camiseta con mensaje 'Paris Colette Club' que compré en la emblemática concept store parisina meses antes de que cerrara. Creo firmemente que son una prenda versátil a la vez que muy cool y un fondo de armario absoluto que lucir los 365 días del año. En la historia de la moda, las camisetas con frases, logos y estampados siempre han sido una declaración de intenciones y una forma de reivindicación. La diseñadora inglesa Katharine Hamnett se presentó ante Margaret Thatcher en 1984 con su famosa camiseta 58% Don't Want Pershing (una crítica a la política armamentística británica). Hubo otros mensajes en camisetas potentes y revolucionarios como Use a Condom (que lució Naomi Campbell), Stop War, Save the world o Choose Life (que llevó George Michael en el vídeo de Wake me up before you go go). En los años 90 y 2000, las camisetas con frases alcanzaron su máximo esplendor esta vez on un tono más irónico; basta con recordar las icónicas camisetas de Paris Hilton. Recientemente ha habido otros hitos importantes de las camisetas con frases como en 2016, cuando Maria Grazia Chiuri lanzaba en Dior las camisetas que decían We all should be feminists, o la camiseta viral de Loewe ideada por Jonathan Anderson para la película Challengers (Luca Guadagnino) inspirada en la que ya usó John F Kennedy Jr. en los años 90. En 2025, las camisetas con mensaje han recuperado su popularidad y tanto celebrities como diseñadores las usan para satirizar, protestar a través de la moda o como una declaración de intenciones. En British Vogue auguraban el regreso de la icónica camiseta 'I Love NY' (la camiseta con mensaje más famosa de todos los tiempos); ""Aunque la camiseta ""I heart"" (diseñada originalmente por el diseñador gráfico Milton Glaser en los años 70 para una campaña turística de Nueva York, antes de ser imitada en todas partes) nunca ha desaparecido del todo, sin duda está cobrando nueva vida este verano. Probablemente haya varias razones para ello: su estilo kitsch tiene cierto aire de los 2000, y también estamos en medio de una obsesión generalizada con las camisetas gráficas en general"", aseguraban. Válidas para todo el año; en verano con faldas o shorts y en invierno por debajo de chaquetas, las camisetas con mensaje son una prenda versátil y con indiscutible toque cool.

Svensk Parfym - Prakt • Smells like gooseberries, fresh air and childhood. Juicy, fresh and brilliant in the spring and summer. Dolce & Gabana - L'imperatrice • A unique fruity scent in that kiwi/rhubarb freshness. Doesn't last particularly long but smells awesome. Giorgio Armani - Ocean di Gioia • Smells like sweet pear and salty air. Really good refreshing scent. Valentino - Donna Born in Roma Gold • Smells like a pretty girl on a tropical vacation. It's primarily gardenia and the citrus and coconut just round it out. Le Labo - Another 13 • Smells like the sweat of a sexy person to me, which may not sound appealing but it really is. It's sexy but in a light and airy way. Andrea Mack - Ceramic • Smells like fabric softener. Slightly sweet, clean and very pleasant. DS & Durga - Debaser • Bright, juicy fig and notes of green notes come across the most. It feels sophisticated to me. Stephane Humbert Lucas - Pink Boa • This is a sweltering hot weather scent. It's really cooling and refreshing, like a pink G&T or shower gel. Vilhelm Parfumerie - Dear Polly • Smells like green apple and black tea. Really fresh but not super long lasting. Narcotica - Narco Oasis • This is a ""I'm a gourmand girl but it's too hot to smell like vanilla cake right now"" scent. It's sweet, juicy, delicious but because it's passionfruity it comes across lighter and not cloying By Kilian - Flower of Immortality • Subtle, juicy peach and delicate floral. . Honourable mention here to PDM - Valaya and Meliora which feel similar to me, also JHAG - Magnolia Bliss. All clean, juicy fruity florals. J-Scent - Yawahada • The only milky scent I've found that works in heat without being too thick. The pear is delicate and juicy and the milk note is quiet but adds a lovely creaminess. Jeroboam - Floro • Fruity, musky. Similar to Valaya but pineapple and apple instead of peach. Phlur - Father Figure. Light fresh dewy fig. Masculine leaning. Vilhelm Parfumerie - Opus Kore • Acai berry note, really juicy and kind of reminds me of shampoo. Atelier des Ors - Pink Me Up • Date night rose for warmer months. Dark and jammy but not too heavy.

Të plagosur në atë atentat mbetën shoferi 34-vjeçar Arens Stafa, Kian Mullaj 19-vjeç, dy vëllezërit Marko Demiraj 17-vjeç dhe vogëlushi 11-vjeçar Dior Demiraj. Dy vëllezërit e mitur ishin në gjendje kritike. Ata shpëtuan mrekullisht edhe falë transportimit të shpejtë në spital dhe ndihmës mjekësore në Itali. “Për shkak të ligjit apo për shkak të procedurës jemi përpara një vrasjeje në kuadër të grupit të strukturuar kriminal, nuk ka çfarë ti shtosh më shumë në rastin konkret”- u shpreh avokati, Ermal Hamataj. “Të qëllosh mbi një fëmijë 11-17 vjeç, është si të vrasës fëmijët dhe është përtej natyrës njerzore me vra fëmijë. Motivi që i ka çuar, duhet të jetë një motiv shumë i rëndë, pasi edhe hakmarrja ka qenë tepër brutale, duke qëlluar mbi fëmijë” u shpreh avokati, Alban Qafa. Nga mënyra e organizimit të këtij atentati hetuesit kanë dalë në përfundim se çdo gjë ishte e mirë-organizuar. Nga të dhënat e deritanishme hetuesit kanë dal në përfundim, se në atentatin e 17 prillit, ku u plagosën të miturit kanë marrë pjesë të paktën 3 persona. Dy që lëviznin me motor, dhe një tjetër që i ka ndihmuar të largohen. Referuar të dhënave nga këqyrja e kamerave të sigurisë motomojeti me dy autorët që qëlluan Benz-in, luksoz ka ardhur nga Arbana. Ata janë pozicionuar pranë daljes së Unazës së Madhe në Shkozë dhe kanë pritur aty për disa minuta. Në momentin që kanë pikasur mjetin tip “G-Class”, kanë hapur zjarr me breshëri. “Nga informacionet që qarkulluan ato ditë, pista e parë ishte ajo e ngatërrimit të një objektivi, por kur shikon detaje të tjera të vendit të ngjarjes, kur ti ke aty 50-60 plumba, bën të dyshosh që nuk kemi të bëjmë me një ngatërrim objektivi”-u shpreh gazetari Xhevair Zhabina. “Autorët që kanë kryer ngjarjen ndaj të miturve, shoferit të familjes së tyre dhe shokut të tyre, në mercedezin G Class, është merecedezi që lëvizte familja Demiri pronari i Pelican Security, kanë qenë persona që i kanë ruajtur që i kanë vëzhguar ato”- u shpreh avokati Alban Qafa. Grupi hetimor, i tha Inside Story, se nga vëzhgimi i kamerave të sigurisë është ndërtuar një pjesë e itinerarit të motorit të autorëve, i cili është gjetur i shkrumbuar në fshatin Fikas të Mulletit. Në laboratorin e policisë shkencore janë edhe disa gjurmë ADN-je të përftuara në vendin ku autorët prisnin shenjestrën e tyre. “Në këto raste me kryerjen e krimit, edhe më pas me djegien e automjetit dhe të armëve që janë përdorur bëhet edhe asgjësimi i provave të mundshme. Dhe pikërisht kjo ndodh e menjëhershme, është e çastit, pak minuta ndan kryerjen e veprës nga prishja e provave” u shpreh avokatja, Dea Toçi “Nga komunikimet që kam pasur takimet që kanë pasur më është thënë që ngjarjet nuk kanë lidhje me njëra-tjetrën, por megjithatë është një hetim paraprak, mund të gjendet ndonjë lidhje e mëvonshme” u shpreh gazetari, Xhevari Zhabina. Për atentatin e Lundrës, fillimisht, u aludua se mund të kishte lidhje me vrasjen e Gjovalin Prendit në Lezhë. Një ndër dyshimet ishte për ngatërrim shënjestre. “Nuk mund policia kurrsesi, të ketë informacione në kohë reale, që tani ndodhi ngjarja dhe pas pak policia thotë që shiko që është bërë ngatërrim i shenjestër ose kjo ngjarje ka lidhje me një tjetër” u shpreh avokati, Ermal Hamataj. “Mund të jenë ngatërruar fëmijët me babanë e tyre, ose xhaxhanë e tyre, por kryesisht mund të jetë babai i tyre, një pistë është kjo, por objektivi ka qenë i saktë familjes Demiri, arsyet duhet të kenë qenë prindërit e dy fëmijëve që mbetën të plagosur” u shpreh Alban Qafa, avokat. Dyshimi nisi të marrë formë nga një detaj që në fillim mund të dukej i rastësishëm: automjeti që u qëllua ishte identik, me një makinë që përdorej nga bashkëshortja e Roan Brahimit, djali i viktimës në Lezhë, i ekzekutuar në Athinë një vit më herët. Po ashtu, edhe target kishin ngjashmëri. Të dyja familjet jetonin në të njëjtën lagje, në zona që mbivendosen në itineraret e përditshme. “Rasti konkret është bërë një rrjedhje informacioni nga ana organeve të policisë, duke hedhur hipotezën se mund të jetë ngatërruar me bashkëshorten e Sidorel Prendit, por zonja në fjalë përdorte audi nuk përdorte G-Clas”-u shpreh Alban Qafa, avokat. “Në rastin konkret policia ka gabuar, a ka gabuar me qëllim, apo ka gabuar se ka dashur dikush tjetër të gabojë këtë nuk mund ta them dot”- u shpreh avokati, Ermal Hamataj. Hetuesit që po punojnë në këtë dosje sensitive, për momentin kanë rrëzuar pistën që i lidh të dyja ngjarjet. Por, kjo nuk hedh poshtë ngatërrimin e shënjestrës. “Mund të ketë një ngatërresë, pasi një sasi e konsiderueshme e plumbave është derdhur në sediljen e mbrapme, ky është edhe shkaku që shoferi ka arritur të vazhdojë të udhëtojë me makinë, pra të ketë plagë jo vdekjeprurëse jo plagë të rënda që ta linin në vend që ti hiqnin aftësinë për të drejtuar mjetin' u shpreh avokati, Alban Qafa. Edhe dëshmia e bashkëshortes së Rohan Brahimit ka ndihmuar në këtë drejtim. Ajo është marrë në pyetje nga hetuesit dhe ka deklaruar se nuk ka ndjerë asnjëherë rrezik."
myinoc8,2025-06-18 20:57:11,en,REDDIT,"  Additional comment to elaborate on my choices (not that anyone asked...) Debut is very green, something young people can wear that doesn't scream VS body sprays. Something that says ""Please take me seriously, I can be a grown woman"" and should be very accessible. I think Elizabeth Arden Green Tea fits that. Its more solar counterpart with Sunflowers fits Beautiful Eyes EP. Aside from the name 'Love Story' being fitting, I think it's a very great scent that's very clean and palatable to many -- which is what Fearless, being her breakthrough album, represents. The top notes are still very bright and citrusy, which represents her youth very well. YSL Libre is kind of a more mature version of it, still white florals being the main accords, but it has that richer vanilla working in the back. I have never had the chance to smell Wonderstruck, but I thought it would be the best choice given it was that era. Based on its notes, it's mostly fruity. So for Speak Now TV, I chose something that was also fruity, but a bit more sophisticated, and that was Chance Eau Tendre. The color of the perfume itself also fits very well with the TV tutu dress photoshoot. For Red, Very Good Girl's notes are litchi, red currant, and rose - which are mostly red. And the bottle design? ""He didn't like it when I wore high heels..."" I think Red is a great album navigating trying to be more mature, but also holding on to your youth. There's a freshness to Very Good Girl thanks to its fruity top notes, but a grounded maturity in its vanilla and vetiver finish. For the TV, I chose Girl of Now which is very almond-y (and a great scent for fall!) , but its tonka bean/cashmere base notes feel like a more refined version. It's kind of like comparing OG ATW and the 10MVTV. 1989 is Le Labo Santal 33, which is NY in a bottle. The TV is Bois Imperial, which is the now more bougie NY scent in a bottle. Still on a santal-related note, Taylor was supposedly confirmed to use TF Santal Blush during rep era. I personally love spicy woody scents, and it has a nice intrigue to it, but the middle floral notes can still make it light enough to wear. Lover is Miss Dior. A nice sweet romantic scent (peach x roses), with a lot of sensuality going on in the back (tonka bean, benzoin). I chose La Vie Est Belle for the LFP which is a lot sweeter, but has that same sensual floral going for it. folklore I smell as something more woody, but still light. I think Mojave Ghost has that balance. evermore with TF Tobacco Vanille (which Taylor also uses) still has that woody accord, but evokes more smokiness. Midnights I think is perfectly encapsulated by Black Opium. It has that cozy vanilla - coffee scent that will keep you up and fades into a woody patchouli. Patchouli is associated with masking the smell of weed, can be an essential oil or incense. ""Cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf..."" TTPD is Mugler Angel because she is an absolute mess. If you look at the notes, you're just like, what the heck is going on here. She's polarizing, but she's literally a star. The bottle itself is a star. But she's endured decades and is still considered a classic. The Anthology to me evokes a lot of introspection, with many of the songs told in the lenses of hindsight. To me, the songs are like stories I would share with someone over drinks in a booth. Jazz Club hits that sweet-smoky scent that makes you feel like you're reminiscing over hazy memories. Lastly, Christmas is the smell of freshly baked cookies, and Vanille 44 gets it perfectly. Other gourmands could work too. (omg this is so long im so sorry)"

myitljr,2025-06-18 21:26:17,en,REDDIT,"  modeled for about 4 years. Nothing crazy — small campaigns mostly, but I did get to work with bigger names a few times (Amazon, Dior, Bottega Venetak I've seen castings from both sides and gotten enough rejections to know what the industry actually looks for. So here's my honest take  no sugarcoating, just real talk. You asked if you should model. My answer? Unfortunately, no. Or at least, not in the high fashion or commercial space. Let me break it down for you properly. First, your look You're not what I'd call “head-turning handsome.” And I don't mean that in a mean way honestly, most of us aren't. But in modeling, that kind of presence matters. Back in the early 2000s, the standard was Calvin Klein-type guys hyper-chiseled, classically attractive. Nowadays, that's changed. You don't need to be textbook attractive. You just need to be striking. Unique. Something that makes people look twice. But in your case, your look feels more “familiar” than distinct like someone we've all seen a thousand times. That's not a good or bad thing in real life, but in modeling, it's a dealbreaker. Your facial symmetry and bone structure. Symmetry isn't everything, but it still counts and yours is around average. Not bad, but not stand-out. If you ran your face through one of those AI symmetry analyzers or face rating tools, I'd bet it would land somewhere in the 5.5 to 6.5 range. That's where most people fall, by the way. Models? They usually hit 9 or higher — or they have some wild, asymmetric feature that works in their favor (like a crooked nose or ultra-sharp cheekbones). You've got a pretty nice jaw mid-set eyes, and proportions that don't command the camera. These things add up, even if they're subtle. Your body. Didn't see it mentioned, but physique plays a huge role depending on what type of modeling you're after. Runway? You need to be tall — 6'0+ at least  which is good but I don't know much about your body you must have a lean frame that clothes hang on like a hanger. Commercial? More flexible, but still needs proportions and posture. If your body's average or undertrained, that's another mark against you. Also how much do you weight ? Can you cut easily ? And what your bf ? Presence and angles. Here's something most people don't realize: modeling is about being photogenic, not just good-looking. There are people who look just okay in real life but explode on camera. You, from what I've seen, don't quite transform on film. Your expressions are limited, and your face doesn't hold angles the way a model's should. That's probably the biggest tell. Show me some pics of smiling, angry, anxious expressions Overall verdict: You're not cut out for traditional modeling. The kind with agencies, castings, runways, or editorial spreads?..."

As global ecommerce sales are projected to rise to nearly $8 trillion by 2028 (eMarketer), the sophistication of fraud continues to grow alongside it. Merchants lose as much as $448 billion annually due to payment fraud, false declines, and returns and refund abuse. At Ascend 2025 in North America, Riskified gathered more than 130 professionals from across the ecommerce ecosystem, including merchants representing approximately $1T in annual ecommerce transaction volume. Live polling conducted onsite captured how the ecommerce industry is responding to current challenges: When asked to identify their biggest challenge in optimizing customer experience while preventing fraud, 85% of respondents cited the need to reduce friction for good customers without increasing fraud risk – underscoring the complexity of balancing automation, manual review, and customer journey consistency. Nearly half (47%) of respondents estimate that up to 5% of legitimate customer orders are falsely declined. For the respondents, a 5% false decline rate equates to approximately $50 billion in lost revenue that, with the right fraud management approach, can instead be converted into topline growth. Approximately 54% of respondents selected “initial checkout and/or purchase flow” as the area that offers the greatest opportunity for improvement in fraud prevention, signaling a focus on reducing friction and risk at this critical point in the customer journey. These results underscore discussions at Ascend 2025, where speakers from Amazon, Macy's, Super.com, Christian Dior, Rue Gilt Groupe, Appriss Retail, Primer, Ethoca, and others presented cutting-edge strategies combining AI, data science, and cross-functional and cross-industry collaboration to turn fraud prevention into a strategic lever for business growth. To empower merchants to meet escalating challenges head on, Riskified showcased its newest lineup of AI-first tech designed to combat the most sophisticated fraud and policy abuses including  Adaptive Checkout ,  Policy Protect , and  Dispute Resolv e . “Fraud isn't a back-office problem anymore — it's a front-line business decision,” said Jeff Otto, Chief Marketing Officer, Riskified. “This survey confirms that the most successful companies are those that treat fraud strategy as a key enabler for growth, conversion, and customer trust.” Riskified's Ascend 2025 North America Summit also featured industry roundtables focused on vertical-specific risks including electronics, fashion, remittance, footwear, omnichannel retail, travel, and gift cards — fostering collaboration and practical solutions among peers.

你總說，創作是一場思緒擺渡的尋覓之旅。 10年前，珠寶創意總監Victoire de Castellane將目光望向迪奧先生的童年花園，那座玫瑰羅盤化作夢境起點，把風的方向、命運的暗示、對未來的渴望，全數織進Rose des Vents的每一縷金光裡，指引眾人航向心之所向。 你不追趕時間，帶著我們一點一點靠近內在真正的座標。 迎接10週年的紀念賀禮，是更為迷人的嶄新之作，呼應迪奧先生對占卜藝術的熱愛，為日常妝點詩意。 明明該獻禮的是我，又被你占了風頭呢！ 10年一瞬，太短了，願你繼續替我們領航，走向浪漫、自由，與愛。 De Beers╳光隱於石
你知道嗎？ 我最近才驚覺，Talisman居然一晃眼就20歲了，正值芳華的歲月，怎能不為你好好喝采？ 當年你選擇大膽用原石對抗完美主義，顛覆大眾對高級珠寶的想像，讓世人重新認識鑽石的靈魂。 那顆未經琢磨、一鳴驚人的鑽石，是不是像極了年少輕狂的我們？ 今年你迎來新成員，將原石融入現代珠寶輪廓，項鍊、手鍊、耳環與戒指…每一件都是你一貫的優雅。 其中的Talisman Locket吊墜項鍊，個人化刻字服務與祕密隔層，化作盛放回憶的私人時光機。 你啊，依然如此懂得人心，願你像原石般保有自我，閃耀下一個20年。 Bottega Veneta╳歲月如織
當他人急於用logo表態，你總是默默不語，用雙手為自己發聲。 1975年誕生的Intrecciato皮革編織工藝，仰賴工匠投注心神，少則數時、多則數日，才能編織出這般柔韌又堅實的時尚語彙。 50年來，它不斷蛻變出新模樣，從包款、鞋履到配件，走過潮流更迭，始終屹立不搖。 半世紀了，那些纖細皮革在你指間交錯成詩。 為紀念這段漫長旅程，你以《Craft is our Language》形象廣告回應世界，邀集演員、藝術家、舞者與工匠，用手勢作為無聲語言，串起人與人之間的連結。 願未來透過你的巧手，拉近那些語言未及的心意與距離。 Loewe╳摺疊所愛
從幾何解構的設計語彙出發，Puzzle是你寫給世界的一封信。 我說，這個包，是一封裝載滿滿回憶的情書，摺進了風景、對話與心動瞬間，打開它，是關於你與我走過的每一段日常，如此輕盈，卻又舉足輕重。 10年了，你從記憶裡挑出19幕片段，以刺繡、貼花、詩句、畫作…勾勒出Puzzle的百變樣貌。 這次為紀念而生的Puzzle 10限量系列，其實是你寫給自己的回信吧？ 每一款都是經典縮影，讓人甘願沉溺在時光的漩渦裡。 10週年快樂，願你一如既往，把故事收進皮革縫隙，承接最真摯的情意。 更多鏡週刊報導

Të plagosur në atë atentat mbetën shoferi 34-vjeçar Arens Stafa, Kian Mullaj 19-vjeç, dy vëllezërit Marko Demiraj 17-vjeç dhe vogëlushi 11-vjeçar Dior Demiraj. Dy vëllezërit e mitur ishin në gjendje kritike. Ata shpëtuan mrekullisht edhe falë transportimit të shpejtë në spital dhe ndihmës mjekësore në Itali. “Për shkak të ligjit apo për shkak të procedurës jemi përpara një vrasjeje në kuadër të grupit të strukturuar kriminal, nuk ka çfarë ti shtosh më shumë në rastin konkret”- u shpreh avokati, Ermal Hamataj. “Të qëllosh mbi një fëmijë 11-17 vjeç, është si të vrasës fëmijët dhe është përtej natyrës njerzore me vra fëmijë. Motivi që i ka çuar, duhet të jetë një motiv shumë i rëndë, pasi edhe hakmarrja ka qenë tepër brutale, duke qëlluar mbi fëmijë” u shpreh avokati, Alban Qafa. Nga mënyra e organizimit të këtij atentati hetuesit kanë dalë në përfundim se çdo gjë ishte e mirë-organizuar. Nga të dhënat e deritanishme hetuesit kanë dal në përfundim, se në atentatin e 17 prillit, ku u plagosën të miturit kanë marrë pjesë të paktën 3 persona. Dy që lëviznin me motor, dhe një tjetër që i ka ndihmuar të largohen. Referuar të dhënave nga këqyrja e kamerave të sigurisë motomojeti me dy autorët që qëlluan Benz-in, luksoz ka ardhur nga Arbana. Ata janë pozicionuar pranë daljes së Unazës së Madhe në Shkozë dhe kanë pritur aty për disa minuta. Në momentin që kanë pikasur mjetin tip “G-Class”, kanë hapur zjarr me breshëri. “Nga informacionet që qarkulluan ato ditë, pista e parë ishte ajo e ngatërrimit të një objektivi, por kur shikon detaje të tjera të vendit të ngjarjes, kur ti ke aty 50-60 plumba, bën të dyshosh që nuk kemi të bëjmë me një ngatërrim objektivi”-u shpreh gazetari Xhevair Zhabina. “Autorët që kanë kryer ngjarjen ndaj të miturve, shoferit të familjes së tyre dhe shokut të tyre, në mercedezin G Class, është merecedezi që lëvizte familja Demiri pronari i Pelican Security, kanë qenë persona që i kanë ruajtur që i kanë vëzhguar ato”- u shpreh avokati Alban Qafa. Grupi hetimor, i tha Inside Story, se nga vëzhgimi i kamerave të sigurisë është ndërtuar një pjesë e itinerarit të motorit të autorëve, i cili është gjetur i shkrumbuar në fshatin Fikas të Mulletit. Në laboratorin e policisë shkencore janë edhe disa gjurmë ADN-je të përftuara në vendin ku autorët prisnin shenjestrën e tyre. “Në këto raste me kryerjen e krimit, edhe më pas me djegien e automjetit dhe të armëve që janë përdorur bëhet edhe asgjësimi i provave të mundshme. Dhe pikërisht kjo ndodh e menjëhershme, është e çastit, pak minuta ndan kryerjen e veprës nga prishja e provave” u shpreh avokatja, Dea Toçi. “Nga komunikimet që kam pasur takimet që kanë pasur më është thënë që ngjarjet nuk kanë lidhje me njëra-tjetrën, por megjithatë është një hetim paraprak, mund të gjendet ndonjë lidhje e mëvonshme” u shpreh gazetari, Xhevari Zhabina. Për atentatin e Lundrës, fillimisht, u aludua se mund të kishte lidhje me vrasjen e Gjovalin Prendit në Lezhë. Një ndër dyshimet ishte për ngatërrim shënjestre. “Nuk mund policia kurrsesi, të ketë informacione në kohë reale, që tani ndodhi ngjarja dhe pas pak policia thotë që shiko që është bërë ngatërrim i shenjestër ose kjo ngjarje ka lidhje me një tjetër” u shpreh avokati, Ermal Hamataj. “Mund të jenë ngatërruar fëmijët me babanë e tyre, ose xhaxhanë e tyre, por kryesisht mund të jetë babai i tyre, një pistë është kjo, por objektivi ka qenë i saktë familjes Demiri, arsyet duhet të kenë qenë prindërit e dy fëmijëve që mbetën të plagosur” u shpreh Alban Qafa, avokat. Dyshimi nisi të marrë formë nga një detaj që në fillim mund të dukej i rastësishëm: automjeti që u qëllua ishte identik, me një makinë që përdorej nga bashkëshortja e Roan Brahimit, djali i viktimës në Lezhë, i ekzekutuar në Athinë një vit më herët. Po ashtu, edhe target kishin ngjashmëri. Të dyja familjet jetonin në të njëjtën lagje, në zona që mbivendosen në itineraret e përditshme. “Rasti konkret është bërë një rrjedhje informacioni nga ana organeve të policisë, duke hedhur hipotezën se mund të jetë ngatërruar me bashkëshorten e Sidorel Prendit, por zonja në fjalë përdorte audi nuk përdorte G-Clas”-u shpreh Alban Qafa, avokat. “Në rastin konkret policia ka gabuar, a ka gabuar me qëllim, apo ka gabuar se ka dashur dikush tjetër të gabojë këtë nuk mund ta them dot”- u shpreh avokati, Ermal Hamataj. Hetuesit që po punojnë në këtë dosje sensitive, për momentin kanë rrëzuar pistën që i lidh të dyja ngjarjet. Por, kjo nuk hedh poshtë ngatërrimin e shënjestrës. “Mund të ketë një ngatërresë, pasi një sasi e konsiderueshme e plumbave është derdhur në sediljen e mbrapme, ky është edhe shkaku që shoferi ka arritur të vazhdojë të udhëtojë me makinë, pra të ketë plagë jo vdekjeprurëse jo plagë të rënda që ta linin në vend që ti hiqnin aftësinë për të drejtuar mjetin' u shpreh avokati, Alban Qafa. Edhe dëshmia e bashkëshortes së Rohan Brahimit ka ndihmuar në këtë drejtim. Ajo është marrë në pyetje nga hetuesit dhe ka deklaruar se nuk ka ndjerë asnjëherë rrezik."

mov_CF8296DEFE5BE6D47CEEECA1DDB4A2AE,2025-06-19 05:36:02,en,WEB,"  Piaget's new 'Sixtie' watch rides against traditional watch silhouettes, riffing on feminine codes from the 1960s to offer new curves and contours In landscapes dominated by the usual, circular suspects – and the occasional octagonal flex – Piaget's new 'Sixtie' landed at Watches & Wonders this year with a bang. It wasn't a rectangle. It wasn't a square. It wasn't an oval. In fact, the Sixtie's silhouette was so radical that it took watch editors a moment to work out what it actually is; the cogs turning as we mentally harked back to junior school shape-sorting blocks. A trapezoid?! Close enough. Like a breath of fresh, fashion-infused air, the Sixtie tells a story of late-'60s glamour, and Piaget's fearlessness in blurring the line between horology and high fashion. For many maisons, the 1960s and '70s were the golden age of contemporary watch design, it was the era that gave birth to the first Daytona, Carrera, Royal Oak and Nautilus – virtually all the big hitters that still reign supreme as the most covetable timepieces to date. Watches were evolving from functional objects into design statements, and the wider world of style and art were beginning to extend their infl uence – it was in the 1960s that Andy Warhol became a notable Piaget collector and tastemaker. It is the asymmetry, bold textures and unusual silhouettes of this era that have informed the Sixtie, which feels unapologetically avant-garde. Its curved contours actually come straight from the Piaget archive, inspired by the 21st Century Collection from 1969, which ushered in a new design DNA for the house, as it looked to the runways of Paris Fashion Week for inspiration for the first time. Softened edges and polished hardstones became part of the Piaget vocabulary, and the Sixtie interprets these influences with retro flair – the Sixtie is available with a bold turquoise dial, as well as a classic mother-of-pearl watch face, and we expect many more colourful iterations to come. 16Arlington, Dior, Ferragamo, Chloé How to wear the Sixtie? At just 6.5mm thick, it's thinner than most vintage bangles and slips under a silk cuff like a secret – let it peep from Acne's black dress with blousy sleeves, which can be dressed up or down with heeled sandals by Khaite or cowboy boots by Ganni. While its rose gold gleam gives contemporary classicism, the Sixtie's off -kilter character requires a little extra pizzazz to make it feel at home, so pick a bold accent colour to liven up your look. We suggest lime – an uplifting jolt of jazziness for summer black, channelled by Pucci sunglasses and Chanel's mint and lime tweed bag. If you're an incurable magpie, you might be tempted to load diamonds alongside the Sixtie, but we think it looks chicer when sitting solo against a bare skin – simply stack the other wrist with bangles to play to its vintage glamour, such as Tom Ford's ready-made duo, and add echoes of summer upon the ears with Jacquemus' sunflower earrings. The Sixtie is such a chameleon that it can just as easily be worn shoreside as it can be in the city – pair it with a print bikini and beaded cap to escape to the coast, and let loose your inner hippie.

mov_98433EAAEEB43C7F0A10BCC21EC79694,2025-06-19 08:06:05,en,WEB,"  Riskified, a global leader in ecommerce fraud prevention and risk intelligence, today shared new insights from a live survey conducted at its flagship event, Ascend 2025, at the 1 Hotel Brooklyn Bridge in New York City. The survey results highlight key challenges and opportunities in ecommerce fraud prevention and its strategic role in driving profitable growth and elevating the customer experience. As global ecommerce sales are projected to rise to nearly $8 trillion by 2028 (eMarketer), the sophistication of fraud continues to grow alongside it. Merchants lose as much as $448 billion annually due to payment fraud, false declines, and returns and refund abuse. At Ascend 2025 in North America, Riskified gathered more than 130 professionals from across the ecommerce ecosystem, including merchants representing approximately $1T in annual ecommerce transaction volume. Live polling conducted onsite captured how the ecommerce industry is responding to current challenges: When asked to identify their biggest challenge in optimizing customer experience while preventing fraud, 85% of respondents cited the need to reduce friction for good customers without increasing fraud risk - underscoring the complexity of balancing automation, manual review, and customer journey consistency. Nearly half (47%) of respondents estimate that up to 5% of legitimate customer orders are falsely declined. For the respondents, a 5% false decline rate equates to approximately $50 billion in lost revenue that, with the right fraud management approach, can instead be converted into topline growth. Approximately 54% of respondents selected “initial checkout and/or purchase flow” as the area that offers the greatest opportunity for improvement in fraud prevention, signaling a focus on reducing friction and risk at this critical point in the customer journey. These results underscore discussions at Ascend 2025, where speakers from Amazon, Macy's, Super.com, Christian Dior, Rue Gilt Groupe, Appriss Retail, Primer, Ethoca, and others presented cutting-edge strategies combining AI, data science, and cross-functional and cross-industry collaboration to turn fraud prevention into a strategic lever for business growth. To empower merchants to meet escalating challenges head on, Riskified showcased its newest lineup of AI-first tech designed to combat the most sophisticated fraud and policy abuses including Adaptive Checkout, Policy Protect, and Dispute Resolve. “Fraud isn't a back-office problem anymore — it's a front-line business decision,” said Jeff Otto, Chief Marketing Officer, Riskified. “This survey confirms that the most successful companies are those that treat fraud strategy as a key enabler for growth, conversion, and customer trust.” Riskified's Ascend 2025 North America Summit also featured industry roundtables focused on vertical-specific risks including electronics, fashion, remittance, footwear, omnichannel retail, travel, and gift cards — fostering collaboration and practical solutions among peers."

mov_4EBC096F322FA2A701E36C1976AD1E31,2025-06-19 08:53:39,en,WEB,"  M&S, the Co-op, Adidas, Harrods and Dior have all been hit by cyber-attacks over the last couple of months. Why the sudden interest in retailers? In April, retail giant Marks & Spencer (M&S) was hit by a devastating ransomware cyber-attack. The incident impacted the firm across multiple channels, affecting in-store sales and resulting in empty shelves across M&S' 1,400-strong estate. The ransomware cyber-assault also took M&S' website down, with the retailer only getting online sales back up and running in mid-June, six weeks after the initial attack. Not long after the M&S incident, another UK retailer, the Co-op was hit by an attack that disrupted operations. Soon after that, high-end retailer Harrods admitted it had suffered a breach. Over the last few weeks, Adidas and Dior have also reported being the victims of cyber-attacks. So, why are adversaries suddenly so interested in retailers, and what should the industry expect following this surge of attacks during the first six months of 2025? Vast estates of disparate, legacy technology combined with large amounts of consumer data make retailers an attractive target for cyber-criminals. The data retailers collect – such as names, addresses and payment information – makes them prime targets for data and ransom demands, says Kevin Modiri, partner and solicitor at law firm Nelsons. Another factor making retailers vulnerable is their use of “just-in-time” inventory systems, and their dependence on supply chains to keep shelves stocked, says Adam Harrison, managing director in the cybersecurity practice at FTI Consulting. Meanwhile economic pressures have driven many retailers to accelerate digital transformation, often without proportionate investment in security. This has created a vast attack surface to manage, Harrison says. “Depending on the retailer, this may include distributed networks across hundreds or thousands of locations, e-commerce platforms, payment systems and loyalty card infrastructure – all of which can create vulnerabilities for cyber-criminals to exploit. “ Customer-facing mobile apps, in-store technologies such as public Wi-Fi, digital signage and internet of things (IoT) devices add to the issue, says Harrison. The surge in retail cyber-attacks in 2025 echoes a trend that was last seen in 2014 – a year marked by a streak of major breaches on large retailers in the US. In most cases, point of sale (PoS) malware was at play, and this led to retailers improving their PoS terminal security, according to a Kaspersky blog. Why are adversaries focusing on retailers again? In some cases it might be a result of the way ransomware operators work, experts say. Well-oiled ransomware operations – where affiliates are actually “distributed teams” of attackers – will tend to focus in waves, says Jim Walter, senior threat researcher, SentinelLABS. This is happening with the DragonForce ransomware attacks that hit M&S, the Co-op and Harrods, he says. Ransomware is so effective in retail because attackers know their victims are likely to pay up. “Their dependence on real-time systems means attackers know that any downtime can cause chaos, which can push victims towards paying up quickly,” Walter says. In addition, because many retail systems are internet-facing and handle sensitive financial data, they are low hanging fruit for ransomware operators, says Walter. “Common initial access vectors used by groups like DragonForce – such as phishing, VPN exploits and credential stuffing – are particularly effective when retailers lack full visibility or robust segmentation across their digital infrastructure.” Once inside, adversaries are therefore able to move laterally using common off-the-shelf tools, escalate privilege and exfiltrate data – before launching ransomware, he says. In some cases, retailers have seemed to be slow to respond to cyber-attacks. M&S experienced “prolonged disruptions”, with online services remaining unreliable weeks after the initial incident, says Holly Foxcroft, cybersecurity business partner at OneAdvanced. A long response time and the eventual discovery of lost data in cyber investigations can sometimes be indicative of a lack of cyber maturity, says Richard Allen, cybersecurity expert, PA Consulting. However, he thinks the approach taken by those recently attacked “appears to be a measured response”. The longer response time is likely to be the result of attackers targeting key infrastructure, which takes time to fully assess, secure and restore, Allen explains. “As retailers often have globally connected operations and interconnected systems, the recovery process needs to be meticulous.” Harrison agrees. “Ransomware incidents are inherently complex as threat actors often cover their tracks, and the damage caused by the attack can make it difficult to fully investigate the circumstances.” Even so, the latest retail attacks reflect an uncomfortable reality – lessons from previous incidents are not always being acted on, says Becky White, senior data protection and privacy solicitor at law firm Harper James. “After a breach, some organisations do the bare minimum to return to operational status, rather than taking the opportunity to reassess their cyber-strategy. This allows attackers to evolve, often recycling successful tactics across similar targets.” Amid this latest spate of attacks, retailers must shore up their defences. If retailers don't address root causes, such as insecure supply chains, poor access controls or unpatched systems, they leave the door open to further compromise, White says. She points to the fact that many recent attacks exploit known vulnerabilities, which suggests that “while awareness may be growing, action is lagging behind”. Education is a key factor in boosting retail security. Modiri recommends “comprehensive and consistent” staff training to improve awareness of phishing, social engineering and other common attack vectors. Conducting frequent audits can help identify and address potential weaknesses before they are exploited and identify any risks to the business, Foxcroft says. Retailers should also ensure they develop comprehensive incident response plans, she advises. “Having a well-defined and tested response strategy ensures quicker recovery and minimises damage in the event of a breach. The plan should be tested regularly with a number of scenarios including different areas of the business – not only the cybersecurity teams.” Written by Kate O'Flaherty..."

Say sayonara to your oily makeup looks and say heyyyy to a matte look. Promising reviews: ""Highly recommend. I learned about it because several influencers use it on TikTok. Tried it and it's my favorite, better than all the expensive brands I've tried before. Smooth application and does an excellent job! Excellent."" —Binnyx1 ""WOW!!!! I've been looking for a pore-filling primer for some time now — I am very, very picky and usually try to use super lightweight primers because my skin is sensitive, so I was a tad bit skeptical of this because it looks so thick in the package photos. However, I'm a BELIEVER now, y'all. It's much less thick than it looks and spreads super easy and evenly. My pores are getting smaller thanks to a new skincare routine, but I've been SO frustrated trying to find a primer that will actually conceal my pores so they don't completely suck up the foundation and make me look awful. This. Is. IT! I wear the primer with Missha BB cream cushion foundation, usually I don't go for super heavy coverage because of said pores but I was able to build to a fuller coverage than what I normally would, and my skin looks smooth and moisturized. Of course if you get super up close pores are still visible but MUCH less so than they are with other primers. You can't beat this for the price. I've even tried the Maybelline Baby Skin pore filler primer and this blows it out of the water. Can't beat it, especially for the price!!!!"" —Jody Ferguson Get it from Amazon for $10. 2.

This article contains affiliate links, we will receive a commission on any sales we generate from it. Learn more When it comes to style stakes, Royal Ascot's Royal Enclosure is place to be. With a strict dress code and a reputation for glamour, this exclusive area plays host to some of the most fabulously turned-out women in the country, including the Royal Family. And this year, the Mirror fashion team got extended an invite. So, armed with our best compliments, we hit the lawns to track down the most stylish women sporting race-day fashion you'll want to copy for your own summer events. From show-stopping millinery to chic co-ords and heirloom-worthy accessories, we chatted to the most stylish women we could find to get the lowdown on what (and who) they're wearing. So, whether you're after inspiration for next year's races or just love a good fashion nosy at this year's top occasionwear trends, prepare to add space in your wardrobe for these pieces– and the lower-priced alternatives we've hunted down... Baby blues and elevated florals Two standout trends dominated the Royal Enclosure this year: dreamy baby blues and elevated florals. Soft pastel shades of blue brought a fresh, romantic feel to the lawns, with everything from structured midi dresses to floaty chiffon numbers turning heads. Meanwhile, florals got a sophisticated upgrade – think bold blooms on luxurious fabrics, intricate embroidery and dramatic silhouettes that felt anything but garden party. Pictured: Laura wears Giles (couture), Patricia wears Erdem's Sleeveless Flared Midi Dress (blue and red colourway pictured) Copy Laura's look for less: Coast Lisa Tan Polo Tie Waist Shirt Dress, £129 Polka dots and Peter Pan collars Playful and polished, polka dots and Peter Pan collars made a strong showing at Ascot this year, adding a touch of retro charm to the Royal Enclosure.

Peter Pan collars, meanwhile, brought a trendy, vintage-inspired edge to tailored dresses and blouses.

From intricate Toile de Jouy (a textile comparable to fine batiste– think Dior) to bold ceramic-inspired motifs, these prints added an almost regal feel to everything from midi dresses to co-ords. Pictured: Journalist and style expert Gabriella wears House of CB's Emely stretch cotton midi sundress in blue floral print, £179 Playful prints Fun prints brought a burst of personality to the Royal Enclosure, proving that Ascot style doesn't always have to take itself too seriously. We spotted everything from tropical palm motifs and fruity patterns to whimsical sea creatures swimming across skirts and dresses. These fun, feel-good prints were a refreshing contrast to more traditional race-day looks, with bold colours and unexpected designs stealing the spotlight.

mov_79CDFC67AE0D0ACB43C0FC81141CF352,2025-06-19 11:51:00,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]Poche ore dopo aver annunciato la nomina di Luca de Meo, ceo di Renault, a numero uno del gruppo Kering, l'erede del colosso del lusso in crisi di velocità ha inoltrato a dipendenti e azionisti alcune osservazioni. Queste Sullo stesso argomento: Dicono in Kering che François Henri Pinault e Luca de Meo, nuovo ceo del gruppo, si siano piaciuti subito, al primo incontro. Nessuno sa se abbiano parlato di automobili, alle quali, peraltro, il manager milanese cresciuto nel team di Sergio Marchionne, poi artefice del rilancio di Seat e dell'eccezionale recupero di Renault, ha dedicato un “Dictionnaire amoureux” un annetto fa, edito da Plon.  Il dizionario è stato tradotto anche in spagnolo, ma ne trovate la pubblicità principalmente su Amazon.fr con la seguente recensione: “Dalla A di Abarth alla Z di Generazione Z, passando dalla R di robot alla S di Senza Patente, Luca de Meo, pdg di Renault, racconta l'incredibile storia dell'automobile, un argomento popolare che suscita grandi passioni”. Mancando la moda ultimamente di entrambi questi valori, la popolarità e la passione, è relativamente facile spiegarsi perché i Pinault, messi nella necessità di trovarsi un nuovo amministratore delegato perché l'erede del fondatore, François Henri, dopo vent'anni alla guida ne aveva dichiaratamente abbastanza, e i due deputy ceo, Francesca Bellettini e Jean Marc Duplaix, evidentemente non hanno dato in questo anno e mezzo la prova necessaria per togliere dal proprio titolo la deminutio “deputy”, abbiano deciso di guardare fuori dal solito circolo, out of the box come dicono quelli che sanno l'inglese, finendo per ingaggiare questo manager di gradevole aspetto, cosa che nel settore offre sempre una chance in più, e che sarà stato certamente innamorato dell'auto, ma non abbastanza da rifiutare la carica di vertice nella gestione di alcuni fra i marchi più favolosi del mondo, in crisi di velocità come Gucci ma anche provvisti di buona tenuta di strada come Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta e Pomellato: se il gruppo ha chiuso il 2024 con ricavi a 17,2 miliardi di euro, a meno 12 per cento, e un utile di 1,13 miliardi, in decremento del 62 per cento, il maggiore imputato dell'imponente calo è senza dubbio il marchio fiorentino.  Leggi anche: le dimissioni                          A fine 2024 Kering aveva debiti per 10,5 miliardi di euro e secondo fonti Reuters rischia il terzo declassamento del rating nel giro di tre anni.  In Francia, la notizia del cambio di corsia di de Meo non ha lasciato indifferente nessuno, soprattutto perché Renault, con lo Stato francese al 15 per cento del capitale, è un simbolo politico, e De Meo lascia mentre il piano strategico “Futurama” è in fase di definizione. La sua uscita, in un'Europa automobilistica in crisi, con l'elettrico al 15 per cento e molte pressioni causate dal rafforzamento della Cina e dai dazi Usa, rischia di rallentare il distacco da Nissan e il rilancio delle auto economiche. La notizia dell'arrivo di de Meo è iniziata a circolare nella serata di domenica, mentre i milanesi erano raccolti al Teatro alla Scala ad ascoltare Kirill Petrenko che dirigeva una eccezionale Prima Sinfonia di Brahms.  La mattina dopo, alla conferma, il titolo Renault è crollato dell'8,69 per cento: il gruppo automobilistico, oggi certamente più solido rispetto al 2020, continua però ad aver bisogno di un leader che ne rafforzi il processo di innovazione. Il che, disgraziatamente, è proprio quello di cui ha bisogno anche Kering: non solo di sistemare i conti, vendendo le attività non più utili e fruttifere e mettendo pesantemente mano anche al personale, tutte attività che un professionista estraneo alle infinite relazioni incrociate interne al settore può compiere certamente senza timori, ma anche ridare di slancio e visione al gruppo.  Non è la prima volta che i Pinault scelgono un manager estraneo alla moda; le stesse reazioni che ora accompagnano la nomina di de Meo si produssero nel 2004 quando Robert Polet, capo della divisione gelati e frozen foods di Unilever, nato e cresciuto in Asia, venne chiamato a sostituire Domenico De Sole al vertice di Gucci. Il “gelataio di Kuala Lumpur”, come venne inevitabilmente subito ribattezzato, in realtà fece molto bene per quasi un decennio e fino all'arrivo di Patrizio Di Marco. E un percorso molto simile, sebbene partendo da posizioni meno rilevanti, è stato quello di Pietro Beccari, attuale ceo di Louis Vuitton, entrato nel 2006 nel gruppo Lvmh dalla divisione haircare del gruppo Henkel come vicepresidente esecutivo marketing e comunicazione, prima di diventare presidente e ceo di Fendi nel 2012 e di Christian Dior Couture nel 2018. Evidentemente, François Henri Pinault deve aver pensato che replicare quei successi sia possibile, anche in un contesto di mercato completamente diverso.  Lo ha anche scritto, in una nota diffusa fra i collaboratori che, pur evidenziando l'ottimo lavoro fatto dai due “deputy”, che hanno “implementato cambi significativi, rafforzando la nostra capacità di azione ad ogni livello” ha messo in chiaro come si sia reso necessario separare le due funzioni di presidente e ceo, “identificando i potenziali candidati” per quest'ultima funzione, affidando il compito non a una ma a ben due società di ricerca (una di queste è stata Jouve).  “Cercavamo un manager di grande esperienza”, anche “internazionale”, “con una visione fresca sul settore e sul nostro gruppo in particolare”. Che, al di là delle precedenti considerazioni, nessun manager della moda  sia stato ritenuto all'altezza del compito dovrebbe far riflettere. "

Grab a sample PDF of this report: https://www.imarcgroup.com/hand-cream-market/requestsample Our report includes: ● Market Dynamics ● Market Trends And Market Outlook ● Competitive Analysis ● Industry Segmentation ● Strategic Recommendations Growth Factors in the Hand Cream Market ● Rising Awareness of Skincare and Hygiene: Increasing consumer awareness of skincare and hygiene is a significant growth factor in the hand cream market. People are becoming more educated about the importance of maintaining healthy skin, especially on their hands, which are exposed to environmental stressors like UV rays, pollution, and frequent washing. This awareness has been amplified by global health campaigns emphasizing hand hygiene, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, brands like L'Occitane have capitalized on this trend by promoting their shea butter hand creams as both moisturizing and protective, appealing to consumers seeking products that align with their heightened focus on self-care and skin health. Social media platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok, further drive this trend by showcasing skincare routines, encouraging consumers to invest in premium hand creams. ● Demand for Natural and Organic Products: The growing preference for natural and organic products is fueling the hand cream market's expansion. Consumers are increasingly wary of synthetic chemicals like parabens and sulfates, opting instead for formulations with plant-based ingredients, such as aloe vera, coconut oil, or essential oils. This shift is driven by a broader movement toward sustainability and eco-conscious purchasing decisions. For instance, Burt's Bees has gained popularity with its beeswax-based hand creams, marketed as environmentally friendly and free from harmful additives. Retailers like Whole Foods and Sephora have also expanded their natural skincare sections, making these products more accessible. This trend reflects a cultural shift toward holistic wellness, boosting demand for clean-label hand creams. ● Innovation in Product Formulations and Packaging: Continuous innovation in product formulations and packaging is a key driver of the hand cream market. Brands are developing specialized creams targeting specific concerns, such as anti-aging, hyperpigmentation, or extra-dry skin, to cater to diverse consumer needs. Additionally, convenient and aesthetically pleasing packaging, like travel-sized tubes or sleek dispensers, enhances product appeal. For example, Neutrogena's Norwegian Formula Hand Cream offers concentrated hydration in compact packaging, ideal for on-the-go use. Companies are also experimenting with eco-friendly packaging, such as biodegradable tubes, to attract environmentally conscious buyers. These innovations not only improve user experience but also differentiate brands in a competitive market, driving consumer loyalty and sales. Key Trends in the Hand Cream Market ● Premiumization and Luxury Branding: The trend toward premiumization is reshaping the hand cream market, with consumers willing to invest in high-end products that offer a luxurious experience. Premium hand creams often feature exotic ingredients, sophisticated fragrances, and elegant packaging, positioning them as status symbols. For instance, Dior's Miss Dior Hand Cream combines skincare with its iconic floral scent, appealing to luxury beauty enthusiasts. Department stores like Nordstrom and high-end retailers like Net-a-Porter have seen increased sales of such products, as consumers treat hand creams as indulgent self-care items. This trend is particularly strong among millennials and Gen Z, who value experiential purchases and share their luxury finds on social media. ● Growth of Gender-Neutral and Inclusive Products: The rise of gender-neutral and inclusive products is a prominent trend in the hand cream market. Traditional marketing often targeted women, but brands are now creating unisex formulations to appeal to all genders, focusing on functionality over stereotyped aesthetics. For example, Aesop's Reverence Aromatique Hand Balm, with its minimalist packaging and universal appeal, has become a favorite among diverse demographics. This shift aligns with broader societal moves toward inclusivity, encouraging brands to use neutral scents and avoid gendered language in marketing...."

Non è necessario volare verso una destinazione esotica o crogiolarsi in acque cristalline per arricchire il guardaroba di item dallo spirito spensierato e libero. Capi e accessori simbolo della stagione calda, come i sandali donna estate 2025. Oltre ai desideratissimi modelli a infradito, a quelli in corda o dal finish prezioso, nel ricco e variegato panorama dei sandali donna estate 2025 spiccano It Shoes che non conoscono declino. Pop, glamour e impossibile da non notare, le ciabattine logate si sfoggiano, ancora una volta, al mare come in città. Magnetiche e divertenti, aggiungono un tocco di grinta ad ogni look. Sotto l'ombrellone o sul marciapiede. Leggi anche It Shoes da spiaggia Sono numerosissime le maison che propongono ciabattine essenziali e pratiche, arricchite da un dettaglio che non passa inosservato. Gucci, ad esempio, immagina slides in gomma caratterizzate da una decorazione cut out volta a ricordare il logo della casa di moda. Christian Dior, dal canto suo, unisce tessuto jacquard e sfumature tenui, mentre Dolce&Gabbana preferisce tonalità decisamente accese. Se Miu Miu e Prada spaziano tra tessuto effetto rafia e inconfondibili monogram, Versace e Tory Burch scommettono su infradito perfette a bordo piscina o sulla sabbia.

Glamour e scenografici, sono in grado di regalare un tocco grintoso ad ogni tipo di ensemble. Lo sa bene Halle Berry che, paparazzata per le strade di New York, ne ha messo in mostra il lato più cosmopolita. L'attrice Premio Oscar, infatti, abbina le sue ciabatte con motivo monogram di Loewe a jeans dall'effetto used e ad un classico blazer bianco. Per uniformi fresche e chic.

Per le giornate estive in ufficio o in vista di un aperitivo in compagnia, ad esempio, perché non puntare su sandali dalla forma a infradito arricchiti proprio da un elemento prezioso e ben riconoscibile.

I sandali donna estate 2025 d'ispirazione sportiva, ad esempio, caratterizzati da fascette e fibbie dallo spirito funzionale, si scopriranno femminili e delicati grazie a questo piccolo dettaglio.

This day represents more than historical significance; it's about honoring the journey from bondage to breakthrough that paved the way for me to raise my children with possibilities they couldn't have imagined. When I think about the entrepreneurial spirit it is the unshakeable faith and the ability to find joy even in struggle.

Been listening since ep77 and have replayed many episodes due to either being caught up, drought, pre Spotify 2x a week drops, all that. The JBP has this weird curse when they mention or host SOME people, those same people have news come out about them. 1. 2ish weeks prior to Pop Smoke passing, Joe and the guys were bigging up Dior and peaking on how they can't speak ill of Pop because he loves his raps. Few later, he passes. 2. Similar story for Mac Miller. 3. Wale has had many calls on the pod and then he comes up for Patreon. Few days later, BET/Kai situation happens. 4. Amerie goes up there for the show, days later her Tiny Desk has criticism for her performance. 5. Tyler Perry BET speech gets killed on the show, kicking his back in. Days later, sexual assault allegations come out. 6. Joe speaks on 50 and Irv and how 50 handled the passing of Irv. Days later, sitting behind him at the Knicks game. 7. Guys talk shit about athleticism, they play ball, Ish pops his Achilles. Yes I know this is only 7 isolated incidences out of 835 episodes but still. Just odd how it happens and something to discuss."

Here are 3 things I take with me: Platform - Expanding what you can see and do The Grande École program gave me both the time and the freedom to explore industries, roles, and cultures. Professionally, I worked at Sisley Paris on luxury market research, at Groupe ADP on international VIP marketing strategy and event planning, and at SAVENCIA on digital analysis. Through academic collaborations, I also had the chance to work with Parfums Christian Dior, L'Oréal, Amazon, and Veepee on real business challenges. Each experience pushed me to adapt quickly, switch between Chinese, English, French, and Japanese, and navigate different workplace cultures. The platform didn't tell me what to do, it showed me how much more there is I can do. People - Meeting talents that Inspire One of the greatest privileges of my time at HEC was being surrounded by truly exceptional people - industry leaders, professors, and peers who challenged and inspired me. What they shared: they were fast learners, expansive thinkers, and generous collaborators. Along the way, I also found some of the most meaningful friendships I've ever had. Working with people like this made one thing clear: the team you build matters as much as the work itself. Leverage - turning resources into real force Before leaving HEC, I wanted to give myself a real test - not in theory, but in action. So I led the HEC Asia New Year Gala, a project that felt like building a startup. No playbook, no safety net, just one belief: can I bring together people and resources to create something meaningful for the culture I come from? From securing 9 sponsors and coordinating teams to curating every detail of performance, foods, logistics and communication - it was a full-scale, cross-cultural operation. On February 4, 2025, with an international team, we held the largest Asia-themed event ever at HEC. That's when I learned to move people, ideas, and resources as one. Thank you to everyone who supported me along the way. Special shoutout to Gachoucha Kretz, PhD - back in M1, before we even met, you offered support and encouragement during my Brandstorm journey. In M2, you welcomed me into the Marketing Program with the same warmth and trust. Marketing is everywhere, I'm sure we'll cross paths again! ❤ Pour conclure, je me permets de reprendre les mots de Rimbaud : « Je est un autre. » Une manière de rappeler que l'identité n'est jamais figée, mais toujours en mouvement. Ces années à HEC m'ont appris qu'on ne se définit jamais seul - on se découvre à travers les langues qu'on parle, les cultures qu'on traverse, et les autres qu'on rencontre. Aujourd'hui encore, je me dirais la même chose qu'il y a 3 ans : accepte l'altérité, sans jamais te perdre, en élargissant ce que tu peux devenir."

They are the latest victims in a rash of shootings involving juveniles in the area. The first happened around 8:30 p.m. Wednesday at a skating rink in Clayton County. Police said they responded to Amish Court regarding a 14-year-old who had been shot in the chest, shoulder and forearm. Officials said they were able to determine the gunfire occurred at Skate Zone along Mount Zion Road near I-75. According to a 911 caller, she dropped off the teen and two others at the rink around 6:30 p.m. About two hours later, when another person went to pick up the children, ""unknown suspects"" opened fire on the car, police said. The vehicle was hit in several spots, and the driver and three juveniles fled the area to Amish Court, police said. When officers arrived at the original shooting location, they said a ""large group of juveniles"" was in the parking lot. Additional officers had to respond to assist with crowd control. Authorities said the alleged gunman, who was not publicly identified, was arrested after a pursuit near a wooded area along Maddox Road, which is a short walk from the skating rink. As Clayton police wrapped up that scene, DeKalb County officers began investigating a separate shooting involving a teenager. In a residential area in the 2300 block of Briar Knoll Road, police said a teen was shot around 2:20 a.m. Thursday. The subdivision is right off Covington Highway. The victim, whose name and age were not released, was taken to a hospital in critical condition. Officials said they are investigating the possibility that a fight led to the shooting. Police confirmed there were no other injuries. No information was released about the shooter. At least three other children were caught in the middle of gunfire recently in metro Atlanta. On Father's Day, Smyrna police said a 6-year-old was shot when gunfire erupted between two vehicles in the area of Campbell and Spring roads. Two men, Craig Radford Calhoun and Eric Allen Rushi, were charged. On June 13, a man was arrested after killing his estranged wife and his 7-year-old niece at a DeKalb apartment complex, authorities said. The victims were identified as Tomika Pullins, 29, and Dior Scott. According to witnesses, police said the suspect, William Lewis Almond, was attempting to get into the apartment. He eventually broke a window and fired multiple rounds, officials said. In southwest Atlanta, a 12-year-old boy was killed June 12 in a drive-by shooting at an apartment complex in the 3200 block of Cushman Circle. One suspect, identified by police as Michael Darnell, has been arrested in the death of Ja'Nylen Amir Greggs, but officials are now offering $15,000 for information leading to the arrests and convictions of others responsible in the incident. Atlanta Mayor Andre Dickens said Wednesday during a news conference with Atlanta police that Greggs was playing outside when he was shot. ""He was caught in the crossfire of an incident that was happening nearby while he was playing basketball,"" Dickens said. ""We never want that to happen. We never want any of our young people to feel afraid to go anywhere - a park, a recreation center, outside."" Copyright (C) 2025, Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

Beyoncé gave us an anthem that captures the complexity of liberation that's both generational gift and ongoing fight.

In her most recent game on Tuesday, she had 17 points on 7-of-13 shooting from the field, 10 rebounds, five assists, one steal and one block. Although the Sky lost to the Washington Mystics, it was one of the finest games she has had so far in the pros. Before the Sky game, she also showed off her fashion sense by showing up to the contest in an interesting outfit that caught the attention of fans. Taking to her Instagram, Reese shared two photos of her game day outfits, where she appeared in a beige box pleated mini skirt paired with a pink and white jacket. She rounded off with a matching pink handbag and baby pink kitten heels. ""i adore you ,"" one fan wrote. ""Pink everything ✨,"" a second fan wrote. ""THE PURSE + THE JACKET ARE U KIDDING ,"" another user wrote. ""if you adore her…,"" another fan wrote. ""Dior baeeee,"" a fifth user wrote. "","" wrote another user. On the season, Reese is averaging 11.0 points, 11.7 rebounds, 3.6 assists and 1.6 steals a game. She's shooting just 37.8% from the field, but her rebounding and defense have proven to be game changers for the rebuilding Sky. The Sky currently have a 3-8 record after going 13-27 last season. In 2024, Reese was an All-Star and the runner-up in the Rookie of the Year balloting after she was taken with the No. 7 pick in that year's draft. In college, she became a prominent star at LSU. As a junior, she led the school to its first women's national championship when it defeated Caitlin Clark and the Iowa Hawkeyes in the final game. The following year, Iowa got its revenge against the Tigers in the Elite Eight round. That 2023 national title matchup sparked a rivalry between Reese and Clark that has helped propel national interest in women's basketball to previously unimaginable heights.

Por 27 euros en Amazon, este perfume encapsula la esencia de una mujer romántica y segura, que busca sutileza sin pasar desapercibida. Y sí: huele como algo que encontrarías en una boutique del Marais, pero sin el precio que duele en la tarjeta. L'EVIDENCE juega en la categoría de perfumes florales chipre. Su pirámide olfativa es equilibrada, envolvente y sofisticada: Notas de salida: mandarina y hojas de violeta Notas de corazón: rosa damascena y jazmín Notas de fondo: pachulí, almizcle vegetal y praliné suave Esta combinación da como resultado un aroma fresco, ligeramente dulce y con un fondo cálido, ideal para mujeres que quieren proyectar elegancia sin recurrir a fragancias excesivamente pesadas. Piensa en un paseo al atardecer por París en primavera: así huele L'EVIDENCE. No en vano, ha sido comparado en foros especializados con perfumes como Chloé Eau de Parfum, Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet o incluso con la vibra romántica de Chance Eau Tendre de Chanel, pero por una fracción de su precio. El sérum con color de Amazon que te da cara de domingo todo el año     El perfume viral de Zara en tiktok: huele a vacaciones, sol y pelo perfecto     Piel efecto Hailey Bieber: el body serum de Zara que imita la luz del atardecer En tiempos donde el minimalismo elegante vuelve a ser tendencia —inspirado por la estética old money, el quiet luxury y la naturalidad chic de iconos como Sofia Richie Grainge— este perfume encarna exactamente esa vibra. Y aunque es perfecto para el día, su estela suave y duradera también funciona como una firma nocturna discreta pero presente. L'EVIDENCE es un caso claro de accesibilidad sin sacrificar sofisticación. Mientras que fragancias como Miss Dior o Lancôme Idôle superan los 80 euros, esta joya de Yves Rocher se mantiene fiel a su filosofía botánica, ofreciendo calidad olfativa a precio ético y responsable. Además, el envase minimalista y refinado —una botella rosada con líneas limpias— refuerza su perfil de perfume “inteligente”: ideal para regalar, llevar en bolso o presumir en tu tocador. Y si ya tienes perfumes intensos para eventos especiales, L'EVIDENCE es ese aroma que equilibra el día a día con elegancia sutil. @mundistyle"

Queremos que sean bonitas, sí, pero también cómodas. Que no las lleve todo el mundo, pero que combinen con casi todo. Y, por supuesto, que no cuesten mitad de tu paga extra de verano. Pues bien: existen. Son de Parfois, tienen un toque verde 'matcha' que no puede ser más tendencia y han conquistado a dos mujeres con mucho, mucho estilo. Por un lado, Violeta Mangriñán, que además de ser fan declarada del té matcha (hasta el punto de haber abierto ya dos locales dedicados a esta bebida en Madrid, su viralísimo Maison Matcha), tiene un radar infalible para encontrar piezas especiales. Por otro, Victoria Montanari, una de las portuguesas más influyentes en redes, que ha hecho de su estilo único su carta de presentación. Y sí, las dos han fichado las mismas sandalias. Algo deben tener. PUEDE INTERESARTE Estas sandalias planas de Parfois son diferentes. No por ser extravagantes, sino porque se nota que están pensadas al detalle. Son planas, sí, pero estilizan gracias a una tira cruzada que se ata al tobillo y una sujeción para el dedo con un adorno redondo en contraste que llama la atención sin ser excesivo. Tienen punta redonda y una suela de goma que hace que caminar con ellas sea como ir descalza (o casi)… pero con estilo. PUEDE INTERESARTE Y ese color… No es el típico verde, pero tampoco es camel. Tiene ese toque que recuerda al matcha, como si hubieran querido plasmar el espíritu de la bebida en forma de zapato. Ese guiño, tan sutil, es lo que las convierte en especiales.

Indeed, there are widespread concerns that even the most advanced ships with cutting-edge green tech are too often connected to weak IT infrastructures that are vulnerable to exploitation, espionage and sabotage. INDEX SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025 SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025 SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025 June 13: CyCraft Technology Co Ltd: Jony Ive Partners With OpenAI To Redefine AI Hardware A Vision for the Future of Computing The partnership, which builds on two years of quiet collaboration between OpenAI and Ive's firm LoveFrom, seeks to reimagine what computers can be. ""I think we have the opportunity here to completely re-imagine what it means to use a computer,"" Altman said in a video statement. Ive echoed this sentiment, noting the world is on the ""brink of a new generation of technology."" A New Family of Devices The collaboration has already produced a prototype that Altman called ""the coolest piece of technology the world will have ever seen."" Ive added that the first device they've been working on has ""completely captured our imagination."" While specifics remain under wraps, posts on X indicate mass production is slated for 2027, with assembly planned outside China, possibly in Vietnam, to mitigate geopolitical risks. This move comes as competitors like Humane AI and Rabbit have struggled with AI hardware, facing issues like poor battery life and limited functionality. Implications For The Tech Industry Ive's departure from Apple in 2019, after 27 years of shaping its design legacy, marked a turning point for the tech giant. Apple's shares dropped over 2% following the announcement, reflecting market concerns about OpenAI's potential to challenge the iPhone's dominance. OpenAI, which sparked an AI investment wave with ChatGPT in 2022, is now expanding into hardware, a space where tech giants like Meta, Google, and Apple are also innovating with AI-driven headsets and glasses. However, past failures like Humane AI's troubled AI Pin raise questions about whether Ive and Altman can deliver on their ambitious vision.

From film critiques [[4]] to summer blockbuster previews [[5]], the buzz is building. Meanwhile, the F1 world isn't without its drama, as a “Disqualified Ferrari” has been issued a warning [[2]].

Brad Pitt's involvement is a major draw, promising a blend of Hollywood star power and the adrenaline-fueled world of Formula 1. Understanding Formula 1 Formula 1 (F1) is the highest class of international single-seater auto racing sanctioned by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA). It features open-wheel, open-cockpit cars racing on circuits and public roads. The sport's popularity stems from its combination of cutting-edge technology, skilled drivers, and strategic team management. Key Elements of F1: Teams: Each team consists of two drivers and a large support staff, including engineers, mechanics, and strategists. Cars: F1 cars are highly engineered machines capable of reaching speeds over 200 mph.They feature advanced aerodynamics, powerful engines, and refined electronics. Races: The F1 season consists of a series of races, known as Grand Prix, held at various locations around the world.

mov_FB752796E4E4B6C3243E1766993C1EC9,2025-06-20 11:30:00,en,WEB,"  A Cotswolds expert has revealed what you should wear when gardening in the UK. As ""allotment chic” has been touted as the latest fashion trend, with high-fashion houses like Dior and Hermès having incorporated horticultural features into their runway shows, perfecting your gardening look has never been so pertinent. Of course, hardy gardeners know that nothing beats wearing the appropriate clothes for comfort, durability and ease of movement, which usually results in an old pair of denim shorts and a T-shirt that predates Tony Blair's time in office. But this intertwining of fashion and gardening has stirred up a storm on social media, with influencers showcasing their green thumbs and stylish gardening attire on platforms like TikTok, and even prioritising events like the Chelsea Flower Show over traditional fashion weeks. The Cotswolds. So if you're a style-conscious horticulturist, here's how to cultivate a great outfit while gardening this summer. “Practicality is key when gardening,” says Cotswold-based gardening and fashion creator Josie Irons, “but there's nothing wrong with looking and feeling fabulous while you're tending to your blooms!” Her go-to is a strappy, lightweight dress, “probably one that's a few years old and already has a scuff or two on it, but most importantly, one that washes well!” While light fabrics are essential, anything too delicate should be avoided, she cautions. “You'll often find me clambering through rose bushes, so silk is a big no or anything that could pull on thorns.” White may be a summer favourite, but not in the seed beds. “Even though I love to wear white usually, I'll avoid lighter colours if I'm sowing seeds or doing any digging,” Irons says. For something more grounded, she opts for “a pair of olive-coloured linen shorts with an oversized floral blouse and a giant sun hat while I'm sowing and weeding in the kitchen garden.” Fabric matters – especially in high summer. “Polyester is a no-no,” says Irons, “not only from an environmental point of view but also because it's not breathable; so you'll be getting seriously toasty and uncomfortable on hot days.” Instead, she suggests sticking to the classics, “[I suggest] loose-fitting pieces in natural fibres such as cotton or linen.” Footwear often falls into the 'functional' category when it comes to gardening, but that doesn't mean style always has to suffer. “I'm always dashing in and out of the house, so something that I can slip on and off easily is essential at this time of year,” says Irons. And while she loves to be barefoot in the garden, there's a good alternative if you want some more protection: “The next best thing are my slip-on Vivobarefoot trainers, which are my go-to gardening shoes.” Barefoot shoes are intended to help with posture and foot health while supporting activity and exercise, which makes them ideal for gardening, Irons says. Spending long days in flowerbeds means sun protection is non-negotiable, but there's no harm in looking good while staying safe. “Accessories are essential!” insists Irons, “a billowy blouse over your shoulders offers great protection, while a sun hat and sunglasses will provide comfort and style.” If you sport your jewellery while doing all odd jobs, there are some pieces you may want to take off. “I tend to remove any large or detailed rings, or bracelets that get in the way,” says Irons, “but who says you can't wear your favourite earrings and necklace while gardening?! They won't get in the way!” You may not want to head straight from compost to cocktails, but a swift refresh is sometimes all it takes. “I must say, I tend to do a quick outfit change if I'm transitioning to a lunch or supper with friends; you simply can't beat that feeling of a fresh shower after you've worked hard in the garden for a few hours,” says Irons. But if you're pressed for time, “a quick hair brush, touch of lipstick and adding a few statement pieces of jewellery will easily elevate a gardening outfit to one that works for a lovely luncheon!” Some brands are better than others when it comes to combining practicality and style. For Irons, who started her career in fashion but now runs gardening masterclasses, she reaches for country classics like Schoffel, Boden or Holland Cooper – outfits she shares on her TikTok and YouTube channel. “My lightweight dresses and linen shorts more often than not are affordable options from H&M,” she says, as it's crucial not to be precious while pottering about in flowerbeds."

f7fe69469182bab9816ade33ca04b5b4,2025-06-20 14:17:00,lt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[lt]Įžymybės „Daug egoizmo filmavimo aikštelėje... Jis nesielgė kaip vienas“: Johnny Depp'o „Arizonos svajonės“ bendražvaigždė Paulina Porizkova patvirtino, kad Deppas filmavimo aikštelėje vaikščios pas elektrikus ir įgulą, privertė juos visus jaustis kaip namuose. Johnny Deppas jau kurį laiką buvo vienas iš mūsų mėgstamiausių aktorių ir jo puikūs aktoriniai įgūdžiai nėra vienintelė priežastis. Internete yra daug istorijų, kuriose daug kalbama apie malonią aktoriaus asmenybę, ypač tų, kuriomis dalijasi jo kolegos. Visi žinome, kad ramiai valdyti šlovę nėra kiekvieno arbatos puodelis. Kartais šlovė gali įkristi į galvą ir sukelti ego spurtą. Tačiau kai kalbame apie Johnny Deppą, žodis „ego“ tiesiog neatrodo jo žodyno dalis. Palaikydama šį teiginį, buvusi Johnny Deppo bendražvaigždė Paulina Porizkova kalbėjo apie filmavimo aikštelėje laiką, kai aktorius ją maloniai nustebino ir tiesiog tapo džiaugsmu būti šalia ir dirbti! Taip pat skaitykite: „Dior“ liko su Johnny Deppu iki pat pabaigos, nepaisant to, kad gerbėjai juos susprogdino, kai laimėjo Amber Heard – dabar teigiama, kad jis yra „kvepalų pardavimo lyderis“ Johnny Deppą pagyrė Paulina Porizkova Taip pat skaitykite: „Jie matė savo buvusias žmonas ir kovas dėl globos“: Amber Heard advokatas tvirtina, kad Johnny Deppas laimėjo tik todėl, kad jo gerbėjai matė jį kaip „atšaukimo kultūros auką ir priešįstatyminį herojų“. Paulina Porizkova ir Johnny Depp kartu dirbo 1993 m. nepriklausomame filme pavadinimu Arizonos svajonė. Režisieriaus Emiro Kusturicos filmas sukasi apie Alexą Blackmarą, kurį vaidina Depas. Pasirodys 2022 m. lapkričio 22 d., serija Skirta kartu su Dogu Bruntu podcast'as, Porizkova prisiminė, kaip Deppas neleido savo superžvaigždės statusui paveikti jo elgesio filmavimo aikštelėje. Porizkova pareiškė, kad kadangi filmas turėjo žvaigždžių ansamblį, filmavimo aikštelėje buvo daug didelių ego. Tačiau ji būtinai paaiškino, kad Deppas nebuvo šios grupės dalis, nes jis buvo labai malonus aplinkiniams žmonėms. „Tai buvo daugybė žvaigždžių, todėl filmavimo aikštelėje buvo daug ego, o Johnny, kuris tuo metu buvo didžiausias širdžių ėdikas pasaulyje, nesielgė kaip vienas. Jis buvo tikrai malonus elektrikams ir ekipažui. Porizkova tęsė, kad Deppas buvo malonus visiems aplinkiniams, įkvėpė ją pabandyti tapti panašesne į aktorių, kai filmavimo aikštelėje užsirašė apie Deppo gerumą. Ji pridūrė, kad jis aplink save sukūrė ramią švelnumo erdvę. „Džonis buvo toks malonus, jis buvo toks malonus jį supantiems žmonėms, kad tarsi tapo visų draugu. Jis buvo tikrai malonus visiems filmavimo aikštelėje, ir aš tikrai į tai atkreipiau dėmesį. Ten, kur jis nuėjo, aplink jį sukūrė šiek tiek ramios švelnumo, gerumo erdvės. Žmonės tikrai į tai reagavo. Aš sakiau: „Aš noriu tokia būti“. Nors jo gerumas Porizkovą labai įkvėpė, ji paminėjo dar vieną priežastį, kodėl ji taip gerai vertina Karibų piratai aktorius. Ji pareiškė, kad nors Deppas galėjo kurti didžiulius filmus Holivude, jis nusprendė skirti savo laiko ir pastangų Keistas mažas nepriklausomas filmas. Deppas už tai gerbia Porizkovą. Taip pat skaitykite: „Štai kodėl jis yra OŽKAS“: gerbėjai sveikina Johnny Depp'o herojišką poelgį, kai išleido beveik 50 000 USD 500 paltų, kad Karibų jūros piratų įgula būtų šilta Johnny Depp'o gerumo aktas Rinkiniai iš Karibų piratai: ant keistų bangų ištiko britų žiema, todėl įgulai buvo itin sunku dirbti tokiomis atšiauriomis oro sąlygomis. Įveskite Deppą. Deppas stengėsi išleisti dešimtis tūkstančių dolerių iš savo kišenės, kad nusipirktų vandeniui atsparias žiemines striukes filmo komandai. Bendraudamas su „The Sun“, vienas įgulos narys gyrė Deppą už dosnų gestą. „Džonis sumokėjo iš savo kišenės už tai, kad visi 500 mūsų turėtume gražias šiltas, vandeniui atsparias striukes. Tai puikus moralės pakėlimas ir dar vienas pavyzdys, kodėl jis yra vienas gražiausių žmonių Holivude. Daugiau susitarti negalėjome. 500 žieminių striukių nėra pigios. Nors pinigai vienam didžiausių šių dienų aktorių galėjo nekelti problemų, jo nesavanaudiškas elgesys neabejotinai atnešė jam keletą puikių taškų su įgula. Gerbėjai taip pat giria Deppą už jo dosnumą, jau nekalbant apie įgulą. Jis tikrai turi reputaciją pramonėje ir tai atitinka! Šaltinis: Skirta Doug Brunto podcast'ui"

Increasingly‭, ‬it is about how we spend our time‭, ‬where we linger‭, ‬and what we‭ ‬taste‭. Across the world‭, ‬fashion houses are transforming the dining landscape‭, ‬turning cafés‭, ‬restaurants‭, ‬and patisseries into‭ ‬the new catwalks of culture‭. From the white-gloved sophistication of Café Dior in Seoul to the buzzing energy of Prada Caffè at Harrods‭, ‬luxury labels are now offering curated culinary experiences‭, ‬each stamped with the same design precision and aspiration that made them global icons‭. Recommended For You The world's finest chefs are donning creative director hats‭, ‬and the runway is extending to the dinner table‭. Welcome to the new frontier‭ ‬of luxury‭, ‬where Michelin meets maison‭. From Couture to Culinary The idea isn't new‭. Ralph Lauren's Polo Bar in New York has long blended fashion and dining‭. But today's renaissance‭, ‬led by brands like Dior‭, ‬Prada and Gucci‭, ‬is on another level entirely‭. Dior's Paris flagship now houses the elegant Monsieur Dior Restaurant‭, ‬where dishes are plated with the same artistry as couture gowns‭. Prada's acquisition of Milan's Pasticceria Marchesi 1824‭ ‬resulted in cafés where mint green interiors and velvet seats create an atmosphere as rich as its espresso‭. Gucci Osteria‭, ‬under Michelin-starred chef Massimo Bottura‭, ‬offers high fashion on a plate in Florence‭, ‬Beverly Hills‭, ‬Seoul and‭ ‬Tokyo‭. Dishes like Parmigiano foam and gourmet burgers capture the maison's playful spirit‭. Why Fashion Brands Are Dining Out In a post-pandemic world‭, ‬experiences matter more than possessions‭. Dining offers tactility‭, ‬time‭, ‬memory‭. A handbag may get you‭ ‬likes‭, ‬but a lunch at Tiffany Blue Box Café gives you a story‭. LVMH leads this charge with culinary activations‭. The Tiffany Blue Box Café in New York serves afternoon tea in robin's-egg-blue settings‭, ‬a modern nod to Breakfast at Tiffany's‭. Such experiences extend brand value‭, ‬increase dwell time‭, ‬and attract younger audiences‭. Suddenly‭, ‬a‭ ‬€20‭ ‬signature cake at Milan's Cova Montenapoleone can deliver the same luxury thrill as a‭ ‬€5,000‭ ‬handbag‭. Pop-Up Cafés and Passport Moments Pop-up cafés are turning fashion weeks and summer destinations into tasting experiences‭. Miu Miu's roving cafés in Paris‭, ‬Shanghai‭, ‬and Amalfi offer playful brand immersion through gingham cushions‭, ‬pastel espresso machines‭, ‬and runway-inspired staff‭. Jacquemus‭, ‬the darling of digital-age minimalism‭, ‬created Café Citron and Oursin in Paris with Caviar Kaspia‭. Every plate evokes‭ ‬the designer's dreamy Provencal world‭. Bulgari extends luxury lifestyle through its hotel restaurants in Milan‭, ‬Dubai‭, ‬Tokyo‭ and London‭, ‬where caviar and fine Italian design blend seamlessly‭. Dubai‭: ‬Where It's All Coming Together Dubai is an epicentre for this movement‭, ‬blending fashion‭, ‬food‭, ‬and architecture in spectacular ways‭. At Dubai Mall‭, ‬shoppers can now indulge at the Tiffany Café‭, ‬where robin's-egg blue walls‭, ‬jewel-inspired desserts‭, ‬and signature lattes elevate afternoon tea to an event‭. Local retailers are following suit‭. DIFC and Jumeirah concept stores now blend cafés with curated fashion‭, ‬knowing that today's customer values experience as much as the product‭. When Chefs Become Creative Directors Chefs are now fashion collaborators‭. Massimo Bottura with Gucci‭. Jean Imbert with Dior‭. Alain Ducasse with LVMH‭. And most recently‭, ‬Chef Gaggan Anand's collaboration with Louis Vuitton in Bangkok‭. At Gaggan at Louis Vuitton‭, ‬a 17-course spectacle sees edible monograms and dishes echoing LV's heritage‭. It's molecular gastronomy meets maison luxury‭, ‬performance art disguised as dinner‭. LV's choice of Gaggan‭, ‬a rebel of Indian fine dining‭, ‬signals the brand's embrace of bold‭, ‬immersive experiences‭. Luxury at 30,000‭ ‬Feet‭: ‬Airport Cafés Take Off Luxury cafés are now landing in airports‭. Louis Vuitton has launched cafés at Doha's Hamad International Airport and London Heathrow‭. At Doha‭, ‬travellers sip single-origin coffee under gold accents‭. At Heathrow‭ ‬Terminal 5‭, ‬LV's café offers branded pastries and cappuccinos‭, ‬turning layovers into luxury moments‭.

mov_EC0EB9A70881C07FC8E639BC6472DA2B,2025-06-20 15:06:09,en,WEB,"  The online ire over the initial peeks at Ryan Murphy's upcoming series about the tragic love story of John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy is a case study on why it's important to get costuming right on TV. Never has so simple an outfit caused such an uproar. Last weekend, a first look at Ryan Murphy's upcoming series “American Love Story,” set to focus on the romance between the late John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, who died in a plane crash in August 1999, dropped online. Actress Sarah Pidgeon, who is set to portray Bessette-Kennedy, was pictured in a number of outfits that, at first glance, seemed reminiscent of looks that are routinely referenced by designers and dissected on social media: A brown leather coat, a black Hermès Birkin bag, a white button-down tucked into a pair of kick flare denim, accessorised with a tortoiseshell headband. But the near-instant online consensus was that the execution was way, way off. “GOD AWFUL STYLING. START OVER COMPLETELY,” one commenter wrote on Instagram. “Her wardrobe is historic. Please source it correctly,” added another. “CBK's fans want to support this movie, but you have to get the clothes right.” Criticism wasn't reserved just for the clothes: Brad Johns, Bessette-Kennedy's hair colourist, told Vogue that the platinum blonde shade Pidgeon sported was “totally wrong.” Many social media users argued that the photos showed a version of minimalism that felt like it could have been plucked off the rack at Zara in 2025, encouraging the costume designers to source archival pieces for a more authentic look. And because CBK's wardrobe was so simple, prioritising sharp tailoring and high-quality fabrics over trends, without any embellishments to hide behind, poorly-made imitations are obvious. Fan outcry shouldn't completely dictate decisions, for the simple reason that nuance is often lost online. Murphy, for example, told Variety earlier this week that the images were simply camera tests, released to ward off paparazzi from stalking the set, and weren't representative of what Pidgeon would actually be wearing in character. But the size of the reaction underscores just how important it is to get costuming right today. While the conversation certainly contributes to buzz around the show, it's also put off Bessette-Kennedy's most devoted fans, who the production will need to build hype before it premieres on Valentine's Day next year. “Love Story” was inevitably going to be the source of online conversation fodder, thanks to its near-perfect timing. Not only has there been a recent resurgence of interest in the couple, the rise in “quiet luxury” and minimalist fashion in particular has reignited interest in Bessette-Kennedy's — CBK to her fans — style. A publicist for Calvin Klein during the brand's heyday, she's long been regarded as the platonic ideal of 1990s fashion, remembered for her affinity for designers like Prada and Yohji Yamamoto and her ability to make anything, from her sleek Narcisco Rodriguez wedding gown to the L.L. Bean boat and totes she carted around Martha's Vineyard, feel chic. Today, designers like Carolina Herrera's Wes Gordon cite her as a muse; on TikTok, a new generation born after her death has more recently fallen in love with her style. Her wardrobe is easily recognisable and often imitated, but because the famously press-shy Bessette-Kennedy did no formal interviews, her clothes were also her primary form of communication with the public. You can't tell her story without the visuals that go along with it. Costumes play a hugely important role in developing a show's inner world, but they're especially important when the project in question is about a person, or even a period in history, that's synonymous with a certain look. “Mad Men,” for instance, channeled the 1960s not just through period-appropriate suits and dresses, but also countless little details, from jewellery to hats and hairstyles. That attention to detail helped develop the story and turn the show into a cultural phenomenon, with countless blogs and books devoted to dissecting each episode's style choices. Love Story's ambitions are in some ways greater than Mad Men's: Not only is it set during a distinct period in sartorial history, but unlike Mad Men, it's recent enough for most viewers to clearly remember, and is about real people to boot. It's a challenging assignment, but not an impossible one. Much of the final two seasons of Netflix's “The Crown” centred on Princess Diana. Costume designers Amy Roberts and Sidonie Roberts put Elizabeth Debicki and Emma Corrin, the actresses who played the royal, in near-exact recreations of some of Diana's best-remembered looks, including her so-called “revenge dress” and her mockneck Harvard sweatshirt and bike shorts. Doing so helped bring her character to life and gave the entire production a realistic feel. Still, costume designers shouldn't feel they must stick exclusively to recreations. Part of the appeal of these shows is that viewers get a chance to see an imagined version of the moments in their lives that weren't photographed. Finding new looks that feel true to the time and the person is equally important. “Love Story” has only just started filming, so there's still time to course correct. In looking to get it right, costume designers should not just go for run-of-the-mill minimalism, but CBK's distinct flavour of it. Murphy, for his part, told Variety that he's assembled a 10-person “style advisory board” to consult on the fashion, and they already have plenty of 1990s Prada bags and Manolo Blahniks available. There are plenty of connoisseurs available to consult, from those operating accounts dedicated to Bessette-Kennedy's style on Instagram to author Sunita Kumar Nair, who spent years researching the very topic for her 2023 book “CBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: A Life in Fashion.” As well, her well-documented love of certain designers can provide a strong starting point. Working more formally with Calvin Klein, for instance, would make sense on both sides — the show could tap the brand's archive for historically-accurate pieces, while the brand could get a marketing boost as it continues the revival of its Calvin Klein Collection label. Doing so can help provide credibility: For its series “The New Look” about the life of Christian Dior, Apple TV worked with Dior on the costumes, gaining access to the house's archives. Though the show received criticism, the clothes were a high point. At the very least, scouring The RealReal's selection of vintage Prada is a good place to start. THE NEWS IN BRIEF FASHION, BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY Kering shares surged as Renault CEO became set to join for its turnaround.

mov_E217B603BA8BC299D213940EFC6B6CD4,2025-06-20 15:16:33,en,WEB,"  Amazon tycoon Jeff and Lauren are set to marry in Italy this week An insider has revealed exclusive details about the wedding to the Daily Mail It's the luxurious, extravagant event that everyone's been waiting years for - and one that some people still can't believe is happening - the union of Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez. After a two-year-long engagement, the day is almost upon us, as the power couple are set to finally get married next week in Venice, Italy, in a summer extravaganza. The guest list is thought to have less than 200 people, with suspected guests including A-listers like Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom and even members of the Trump family. The Amazon boss has booked the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, one of the largest and grandest buildings in the historical center of Venice, as part of the multi-day-long extravaganza of celebrations. Up until now, little has been known about what may be dubbed as the wedding of the year - but a source in Italy has exclusively revealed to the Daily Mail all of the intimate details that you need to know. According to the insider, Bezos' $500 million superyacht, Koru, will be moored off the coast of San Georgio Maggiore island, which is home to the famous Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore, a 16th century Benedictine church. They shared that the island is 'off-limits to visitors' from June 24 to June 29, with the mayor believing that the wedding will take place on the yacht - although The Misericodria, an iconic event space in Venice, has been boked out from June 26 to June 28. It's unclear if the space is related to their wedding, but the insider added that a private tender service is said to be taking guests from the island to the yacht. In addition to the private tenders, the source revealed that around 60 of Venice's water taxis are reserved for the week, with some of the 400 gondolas on the island out of commission as well. The insider also confirmed that Venice is expecting '200 guests who will stay at local hotels,' although it's unclear which ones. Some of the most expensive and high-end hotels in the Italian city include The Aman, where you can book a room for over $2,700 per night, and Hotel Cipriani, which goes for over $2,000 per night. Once their guests arrive, they will be treated to a few luxurious surprises, of course. The source confirmed to the Daily Mail that local bakery Rosa Salva Venetia will be providing pastries for the extravagant weekend. The delicious menu items at the bakery include tiramisu, flaky, cream-filled pastries, and fritelli, a traditional Italian fried treat. However, Rosa Salva Venetia will not be providing the wedding cake for the loved-up couple. Our source claimed that a celebrity wedding planner, who is not working this event, has heard that guests will receive 'opulent' gifts just for attending the nuptials. And it looks like all of this opulence is thanks to Sanchez herself, as her hubby-to-be revealed in a 2023 Vogue interview that he wouldn't dare get involved with wedding planning. 'Oh, God, no. Do I look that dumb?' Bezos told the outlet when he was asked if he had a big part in the preparations. During the interview, the future Mrs. Bezos listed Christian Dior, Dolce & Gabbana, and Valentino as some of her favorite designers, but didn't share anything about which one will make her gown - or gowns, for that matter. Separate sources recently told the Daily Mail that the festivities are expected to cost anywhere from $15 to $20 million. Many things went into the estimate of the total cost, including transportation fees, her wedding dress and catering. While their wedding is rapidly approaching, a psychic who has accurately predicted a number of monumental world events told the Daily Mail earlier this week that believes the pair will be divorced by 2029. Athos Salomé, 38, from Brazil, is often referred to as the 'Living Nostradamus' due to his numerous accurate predictions - including his forecasting of the coronavirus pandemic, Queen Elizabeth II's death and the Microsoft global outage. He said that their wedding will go forward as planned, he believes their 'motivations' are 'far from romantic love.' 'The marriage is more of a contract for image, power and legacy perpetuation than a celebration of affection,' Salomé told the Daily Mail. 'Lauren embodies the archetype of the idealized woman in Bezos' new public phase. The union will last for a while, but it is not eternal,' he continued. The clairvoyant revealed that he's 'certain' their marriage has an 'end' - and claimed that it will be between 2028 and 2029, if not sooner. 'It will be a clean divorce, without scandal. A meticulously planned separation, protected by confidentiality clauses and image strategies,' he explained."

Ora ha una nuova fidanzata: ecco chi è. di Lucrezia Ciotti Pubblicato il 20 Giugno 2025 alle 18:45 Alessio Pecorelli, ex tronista di Uomini e Donne, ha vissuto un percorso turbolento all'interno del celebre programma, conclusosi bruscamente a causa di alcune segnalazioni che ne hanno messo in discussione la sincerità. Nonostante la fine anticipata di questa avventura televisiva, Alessio sembra sia riuscito a voltare pagina nella vita privata, trovando un nuovo amore. Tutti i dettagli. Alessio Pecorelli, dal ritiro forzato a Uomini e Donne a una nuova svolta nella vita privata Alessio Pecorelli, originario di Santa Marinella nel Lazio e 31enne, è stato tra i tronisti dell'edizione 2024/2025 di Uomini e Donne condotto da Maria De Filippi. Prima di approdare al dating show, Alessio ha maturato un percorso personale e professionale variegato: ha prestato servizio militare e, a partire dai 22 anni, si è dedicato all'imprenditoria nel settore della ristorazione, gestendo un ristorante di pesce a Santa Severa. Appassionato di sport, in particolare di pugilato, pratica anche K1 e MMA da diversi anni. Nel suo percorso televisivo, però, la sua esperienza a Uomini e Donne si è interrotta bruscamente dopo alcune segnalazioni che hanno messo in dubbio la sua sincerità, portandolo a lasciare il programma anzitempo. Prima di entrare nel dating show, Alessio aveva raccontato di aver vissuto una relazione importante, terminata male, e si dichiarava single da due anni e mezzo. Il suo obiettivo dichiarato era trovare una compagna con cui costruire un futuro e diventare padre, oltre a sperimentare emozioni forti ormai lontane nel tempo. Uomini e Donne: nuovo amore per Alessio Pecorelli, la verità sulla sua love story L'ex protagonista del famoso dating show di Canale 5 ha reso ufficiale la sua storia con Virginia Colozzi, una modella dai capelli scuri e numerosi tatuaggi. La prima conferma è arrivata da una tenera Instagram story di Alessio, accompagnata da una frase tratta dalla canzone Quando di Pino Daniele: “Perché ho sete, ho sete ancora”. Un messaggio sottile che ha fatto intuire l'inizio di un legame speciale. La conferma è arrivata tramite un video postato dall'ex tronista, che lo ritrae mentre guida una moto, svelando l'identità della sua nuova compagna. Lavora con un'agenzia specializzata nel lancio di modelli e influencer e si definisce “mamma di Dior”, il suo cane."

I wanted to come post here on LinkedIn in an attempt to give these past 3 years at HEC Paris their deserved due. Now not only do I get to say that I have a Master's degree in Management with specialisation in Marketing but more importantly, that these years were the best 3 years of my life - full of lessons, growth, and unexpected moments of ""wow life gets real from here"". Most of all, I'm grateful for the kind souls I met along the way, who showed up for me when I needed it most. Through them, I learned to show up for myself too. So before I continue, a massive shoutout to my friends, my classmates and my parents, without whom I wouldn't be here :) I am incredibly privileged to have had the opportunity to study at HEC Paris and this was something I was consciously aware of through all the classes, group presentations and company visits (Parfums Christian Dior, Amazon, L'Oréal, McKinsey & Company, Veepee, EssilorLuxottica to name a few). Some of these opportunities felt like pinch me moments when I thought about how 21 year old me would have never imagined myself here. The chances to grow and shine and connect as part of this community were incredible to say the least. Whether it was the more generalist track of M1, the work stints at Danone and L'Oréal during my professional gap year, or the marketing focused company projects during M2, it was all a truly eventful ride full of highs and lows but consistent growth. Massive thanks to Gachoucha Kretz, PhD and Marion BOUYOU for making the marketing cohort what it was - I am glad to have ended my HEC journey with such a rich experience.

I wanted to come post here on LinkedIn in an attempt to give these past 3 years at HEC Paris their deserved due. Now not only do I get to say that I have a Master's degree in Management with specialisation in Marketing but more importantly, that these years were the best 3 years of my life - full of lessons, growth, and unexpected moments of ""wow life gets real from here"". Most of all, I'm grateful for the kind souls I met along the way, who showed up for me when I needed it most. Through them, I learned to show up for myself too. So before I continue, a massive shoutout to my friends, my classmates and my parents, without whom I wouldn't be here :) I am incredibly privileged to have had the opportunity to study at HEC Paris and this was something I was consciously aware of through all the classes, group presentations and company visits (Parfums Christian Dior, Amazon, L'Oréal, McKinsey & Company, Veepee, EssilorLuxottica to name a few). Some of these opportunities felt like pinch me moments when I thought about how 21 year old me would have never imagined myself here. The chances to grow and shine and connect as part of this community were incredible to say the least. Whether it was the more generalist track of M1, the work stints at Danone and L'Oréal during my professional gap year, or the marketing focused company projects during M2, it was all a truly eventful ride full of highs and lows but consistent growth. Massive thanks to Gachoucha Kretz, PhD and Marion BOUYOU for making the marketing cohort what it was - I am glad to have ended my HEC journey with such a rich experience. Despite the challenges, I'd do it all over again, but the only way to move is to move forward now and so I am excited to see where life takes me as I transition into this new phase. Big congratulations to everyone who graduated! #graduation2025"

18180596278323506,2025-06-20 17:52:05,en,INSTAGRAM,"  A day in St. Tropez: — Place des Lices: A lively market open Tuesdays and Saturdays, with everything from clothing and accessories to fresh produce and beauty finds. It's extremely crowded and busy—but a fun walk-through if you're in the mood for a little chaos. — Tarte Tropézienne: A must. The Saint-Tropez icon—a sugar-dusted brioche split and piled high with fresh cream. Highly recommend the one with raspberries. It's next-level. — Designer shopping: Rue François Sibilli is where you'll find Dior, Chanel, and Celine—but don't sleep on the boutiques tucked into cobblestone side streets. Lots of vintage and chic beachwear. Jay found a really cool shirt at bleumonjules — Vieux Port: Pastel houses, giant yachts, and the prettiest water. Classic St. Tropez vibes. — Pampelonne Beach: If you're staying longer than a day trip, definitely book at the iconic leclub55official. Sip a glass of rosé and pretend you're in a Slim Aarons photo. We drove in from Mandelieu (near Cannes) and it took 2.5 hours to get there and 2 hours back. It's a long day of driving—and we somehow ended up on this terrifying off-road path that felt like a scene out of itsthegrandtour . If you can, I recommend taking a boat or even a helicopter to make the most of your time and avoid the headache. Also: toilets are nearly impossible to find. Most small restaurants and cafés don't have any, and the one public washroom near Place des Lices had a massive lineup. Just something to keep in mind. All in all, I'd give St. Tropez a 6/10—but mostly because of the drive and the lack of accessible toilets. So yes, I'm a little biased."

mov_715D3FCD6963886FAAED552404BA96DE,2025-06-20 18:23:30,en,WEB,"  Jeff and Lauren will be giving lavish gifts to their wedding attendees The two are reportedly marrying this week in Venice, Italy, on his yacht After a two-year engagement, Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos and former journalist Lauren Sanchez are set to marry next week in Venice, Italy, among a star-studded guest list - and an insider has now revealed that extremely lavish gift that the VIP guests will receive just for attending. An insider told the Daily Mail that Bezos' $500 million superyacht, Koru, will be moored off the coast of San Georgio Maggiore island, which is home to the famous Basilica of San Giorgio Maggiore, a 16th century Benedictine church. They shared that the island is 'off-limits to visitors' from June 24 to June 29, with the mayor of Venice believing that the wedding will take place on the yacht. The Amazon boss has allegedly booked the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, one of the largest and grandest buildings in the historical center of Venice, as part of the multi-day-long extravaganza of celebrations. It's unclear if the space is related to their wedding, but it's booked from June 26 to June 28. The insider added that a private tender service is said to be taking guests from the island to the yacht. The guest list is thought to be intimate, with less than 200 people, and suspected guests including A-listers like Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, and even members of the Trump family. And now, it's been revealed to the Daily Mail by a source in Italy that each guest will be receiving hand-blown glassware by local glassmaker Laguna B. The glassware company was originally created by Marie Brandolini, who left New York in 1988 to live in Venice. Her idea came about after her stepfather gave her a goti de fornasa - a traditional drinking glass crafted by Murano glassmakers - which inspired her to make her own, putting her own spin on it to create something 'new and personal.' Her son later took over the business after she passed in 2013, per Vogue. The handmade glassware features bright colors, stripes, and floral details. All of the glasses have different motifs and designs, with one large-size cup running customers $167. The handmade glassware are not the only things that guests will be coming back home with. The insider told Daily Mail that a wedding planner who is not working this event has heard that guests will receive other 'opulent' gifts for attending. It's unclear what those other gifts will be, but Sanchez is known to be a fan of fun designer purses, like the $5,750 Balenciaga 9AM Coffee Cup Clutch Bag, which she was seen carrying in March. The luxe item is designed as a tote bag shaped like a coffee cup. The Kardashian family also gifted her a designer bag worth nearly $7,000 following her Blue Origin space trip. The gift was a crystal adorned Judith Leiber UFO-inspired bag after she landed back on solid ground. But of course, guests will also be treated to a few other luxurious surprises during their time in Italy for the wedding. The source confirmed to the Daily Mail that local bakery Rosa Salva Venetia will be providing pastries for the extravagant weekend. The delicious menu items at the bakery include tiramisu, flaky, cream-filled pastries, and fritelli, a traditional Italian fried treat. However, Rosa Salva Venetia will not be providing the wedding cake for the loved-up couple. It looks like all of this opulence is thanks to Sanchez herself, as her hubby-to-be revealed in a 2023 Vogue interview that he wouldn't dare get involved with wedding planning. 'Oh, God, no. Do I look that dumb?' Bezos told the outlet when he was asked if he had a big part in the preparations. During the interview, the future Mrs. Bezos listed Christian Dior, Dolce & Gabbana, and Valentino as some of her favorite designers, but didn't share anything about which one will make her gown - or gowns, for that matter. Separate sources recently told the Daily Mail that the festivities are expected to cost anywhere from $15 to $20 million. Many things went into the estimate of the total cost, including transportation fees, her wedding dress and catering."
1lgbnpc,2025-06-20 18:42:42,en,REDDIT,"  ive been racking my brain since that second week trying to figure out why i even feel this way about you. why do i care so deeply about someone i dont know deeply? eventually i accepted that i was just enchanted by you. then, i noticed stuff about you, like how beautiful your smile is, how you start messages with my name, how often you wear collared shirts, how you were never afraid to ask questions. and when i learned that you were a war refugee, my admiration for you swelled because you are so damn strong. you fled to here just a few years ago and are already doing so many extraordinary things. i hate that this story has no ending. i really fucking hate it. i hate that i miss you. i hate that i associate certain things with you, like the number 118, that Dior perfume, phasor diagrams, and those four letters. i hate that i will probably never see you again. but when we go on our separate paths, ill keep looking up to you. ill keep working hard. ill keep practicing resilience. ill keep aiming to be extraordinary. because you inspired me. maybe thats why its so hard to move past this."
mov_146462A25D54E6AB2A75F1281E2BD4C1,2025-06-20 19:00:00,en,WEB,"  Amazon gazillionaire Jeff Bezos is reportedly dropping $US10 million ($15.5 million) to marry his second wife, former TV presenter and amateur astronaut Lauren Sánchez, on the Venetian island of San Giorgio Maggiore next week. Last month, Kim Kardashian and Katy Perry partied at Sanchez's Paris hen night as an army of lawyers finalised the pre-nup. Such big-ticket wedding extravaganzas are much more than a celebration of love, of course: beyond the spectacle, they are highly choreographed PR offensives that the media lap up, giving the rest of us a glimpse into the rarefied orbits of the world's rich, famous and powerful. In 2007, I spent a week clinging to a rocky outcrop, fighting off the French paparazzi under the searing Mediterranean sun, while watching Tom Cruise, his then-wife Katie Holmes, Eddie McGuire, Shane Warne and most of the Murdoch family live the good life aboard superyachts during James Packer's six-day, $6 million wedding to Erica Packer. The bride wore a $150,000 dress by John Galliano for Christian Dior while Sarah Murdoch dazzled in a bikini on the deck of a $50 million Mangusta. At James' big sister Gretel Packer's lavish 1991 wedding in West Sussex, waiters were doused in Chanel No. 5 before being unleashed among the VIP guests gathered in a mock-Cotswold stone marquee fashioned out of polystyrene; Kerry Packer was clearly out to impress the Brits. In 2006, my lips turned blue hiding behind a pot plant as I listened to Keith Urban serenade his new bride, Nicole Kidman, on a freezing Sydney winter's night, while the wreck of the Hesperus had nothing on me after I'd chased Bec and Lleyton Hewitt's 2005 wedding flotilla across a choppy Sydney Harbour aboard a clapped-out fishing tinnie. Brynne Edelsten admitted she'd never met most of the guests at her extravagant 2009 Melbourne wedding to the late, disgraced medico Geoffrey Edelsten, who'd paid Jason Alexander and Fran Drescher to attend. Kyle Sandilands gave away tickets on air to his first wedding, to Tamara Jaber in 2008 and, in 2023, raised eyebrows by inviting PM Anthony Albanese and NSW Premier Chris Minns – along with underworld figure John Ibrahim and convicted drug trafficker Simon Maine – to his second wedding to Tegan Kynaston. Meanwhile, Australia's richest human, Gina Rinehart, caused a scandal when she flew then-deputy Liberal leader Julie Bishop and Nationals Senate leader Barnaby Joyce to the sumptuous, three-day wedding of the granddaughter of a prominent business associate in Hyderabad in 2011. According to industry statistics, the cost of the average wedding in Oz is $33,810. For the amount he's paying, Bezos could say “I do” 458 times.

 潮玩（Designer Toys／Collectible Toys）之所以能迅速流行并保持可持续发展，归功于其背后的多维思维模型 
通过情感化IP构建与盲盒机制拉近与消费者的情感距离，借助社区与社交裂变激发二次传播，并通过多元跨界合作不断注入新鲜元素。 同时，持续性的关键在于IP多样化与迭代更新、高品质与收藏价值、以及对合规与社会责任的重视，并在全球化布局中保持本地化共鸣。 以下将结合KAWS、Sonny Angel、手办、Hello Kitty、熊本熊（Kumamon）和Molly等典型案例，深入剖析其流行与可持续背后的思维模型。 一、潮玩流行的思维模型 
情感化IP构建 
通过赋予角色独特个性与故事，实现与消费者的情感共鸣。 如KAWS的“Companion”在经典卡通形象基础上注入黑白交错的“X”眼设计，既保留熟悉感，又带来“次文化”属性，迅速在社交媒体走红christies.com。 熊本熊利用“呆萌”“惊讶”表情，打造出无性别、无年龄限制的普适可爱形象，三年内带动地域经济收益超12亿美元en.wikipedia.org。 盲盒（Blind Box）机制 
盲盒通过“未知—期望—揭晓”的随机奖励循环，激发神经多巴胺分泌，带来“开箱快感”与“收集成就”elpais.com。 Sonny Angel自2005年起以季节限定与秘藏款式不断更新系列，引发消费者“想要凑齐全套”的持续购买动力，同时形成线上线下交易与交换社区reddit.com。 心理学基础： 多变的酬赏（Variable Reward）、收集癖、完成欲、FOMO（错失恐惧症）。 案例分析： 
Molly / Pop Mart (泡泡玛特)： Pop Mart正是靠Molly这个IP，将“盲盒”模式在中国发扬光大，并成功上市。 用户购买的不仅是Molly娃娃本身，更是开盒瞬间的惊喜、刺激和期待。 为了集齐一整套或抽中概率极低的“隐藏款”，用户会不断复购，从而创造了巨大的商业价值。 Sonny Angel： 作为盲盒界的“前辈”，Sonny Angel的成功同样源于此。 其“光屁股娃娃+不同头饰”的固定公式，配上不断推陈出新的系列和隐藏款，让全球的收集者们为之疯狂，持续购买了十几年。 社区与社交裂变 
潮玩爱好者通过线下盲盒开箱活动、线上平台晒图与交换，构建稳固社区。 Pop Mart的Molly系列在各大城市开设“潮玩展”，并在社交平台设立话题标签，形成粉丝自发传播与二级创作henryjenkins.org。 Sonny Angel粉丝在Reddit、微博等社区分享交换心得，增强了品牌黏性reddit.com。 “病毒符号”模型 (The Viral Symbol Model) 
核心逻辑： 创造一个极简、独特、高辨识度且易于传播的视觉符号，使其可以像病毒一样，轻松地“寄生”在任何媒介上，并被大众快速识别和记忆。 心理学基础： 视觉锤理论、模因（Meme）传播、认知简洁性。 案例分析： 
KAWS： 最极致的典范。 标志性的“XX”眼睛和豆荚状的大手，就是他的病毒符号。 这个符号可以印在优衣库的T恤上（大众化传播），可以与Dior联名（提升价值），可以放大成巨型雕塑（制造公共事件）。 无论载体是什么，人们一看“XX”眼就知道是KAWS，传播成本极低。 熊本熊 (Kumamon)： 他那略带“呆萌”和“笨拙”的表情包，本身就是极易传播的社交货币。 他的“官方人设”是一个经常搞砸事情的公务员，这种“不完美”的亲切感使其在社交网络上被大量二次创作和传播，迅速引爆全球。 多元跨界合作 
通过与时尚、艺术、影视等领域IP联名，注入话题性与艺术性。 例如KAWS与Dior、UNIQLO等品牌跨界联名，不仅提升艺术价值，也扩大了潮玩受众圈层blog.artsper.com。 Hello Kitty则长期与不同行业合作，从车型到航空公司，为品牌持续制造“新鲜感”corporate.sanrio.co.jp。 “稀缺/炒作”模型 (The Scarcity & Hype Model) 
核心逻辑： 通过人为控制发售数量、渠道和合作对象，创造出“一物难求”的市场局面，从而提升商品的感知价值和社交价值。 拥有稀缺品，本身就是一种身份和品味的象征。 心理学基础： 稀缺性原则、社会认同、凡勃伦效应（炫耀性消费）。 案例分析： 
KAWS： 他的原创艺术品和限量版画价格高昂，而其限量的实体公仔，通过官方“Drop”（突袭发售）模式，往往在几秒钟内售罄，并迅速在二级市场（如StockX）上价格翻几番。 “买到即赚到”的预期，吸引了大量的潮流玩家和投机者，进一步推高了其热度。 手办 (High-end Figures)： 高端手办通常采用“预定制生产”，错过预定就极难原价买到。 各种“会场限定”、“通贩限定”等销售策略，都是在利用稀缺性来刺激消费者的购买欲望。 二、潮玩可持续发展的关键因素 
“IP故事与情感连接”模型 (The IP Story & Emotional Connection Model) 
核心逻辑： 潮玩不能仅仅是一个好看的“空壳”，它必须承载一个故事、一种性格或一种情感，让用户能够与之建立深度的情感连接。 没有故事的玩具是消费品，有故事的玩具是“伙伴”。 心理学基础： 叙事心理学、移情作用、怀旧情节、角色认同。 案例分析： 
Hello Kitty： 可持续发展的终极教科书。 她背后有一个完整的世界观（家人、朋友、爱好），但其“无口”设计又留给了人们巨大的情感投射空间。 她代表的是“纯真、善良、友谊”等普世价值观，这种强烈的情感内核，使她穿越了50年的时间，成为几代人的共同记忆和情感寄托。 手办： 手办的价值完全依附于其原作（动漫、游戏）的IP故事。 你会花上千元买一个Saber的手办，是因为你被《Fate》系列宏大的故事和Saber这个角色的坚韧、忠诚所打动。 手办是粉丝对这份情感的“实体化”收藏。 没有故事，它就一文不值。 Molly： Molly的设定是一个有着湖绿色大眼睛、总是撅着嘴的傲娇小女孩。 她的这种“小脾气”、“小个性”让很多年轻消费者觉得“仿佛看到了自己”，从而产生了强烈的情感认同。 IP多样化、联名与迭代更新 
持续推出新品与限量款，避免“IP疲劳”。 Pop Mart旗下Labubu系列年销售近20亿美元，但也在不断孵化新角色与故事线，以保持产品矩阵的新颖度ft.com。 核心逻辑： 将IP本身作为一个开放的“平台”，通过不断地跨界联名、艺术再创作和新系列迭代，持续地为品牌注入新鲜感和生命力，使其能适应不同时代和圈层的审美。..."

Un Été Français parfum by Celine Celine's new Un Eté Français (A French Summer) fragrance, created by former creative director Hedi Slimane, draws inspiration from long, languid summers in a beach house in Ramatuelle on the French Mediterranean. The latest addition to the brand's Haute Parfumerie collection opens with spicy bergamot and earthy petit-grain, softening into zesty neroli and gorse – a wild coastal flower with a citrus-coconut scent. A warm vanilla base evokes the essence of a French holiday in a bottle. Un Été Français perfume, Dh1,200 for 100ml Rafiafiori by Dolce & Gabbana Dolce & Gabbana nods to a cooler, more laid-back style for summer for 2025. Ditching corsetry and black lace, the Italian masters of Sicilian vamp embrace skinny knit stripes and easy raffia accessories. A pompom raffia tote, hand-cut raffia necklace and cat-eye sunglasses wrapped in Madagascan palm leaf complete the nature-led look with breezy, effortless cool. Raffia tote bag, Dh5,200, Dolce & Gabbana Grain de Café y Cartier A reimagining of Jeanne Toussaint's 1938 motif, Cartier's Grain de Cafe – literally coffee bean – continues to charm. The latest bold, sculptural pieces echo the 1930s origin story while nodding to the glamour of 1950s cocktail jewellery. A standout limited-edition bracelet is crafted around a platinum and diamond spine, with 14 variegated gold beans on either side, each tipped with a white diamond. Meticulously made, each bracelet takes 54 hours to complete. Limited-edition Grain de Café bracelet, price upon request Maison Dioriviera by Dior The Dior universe has expanded to include new homeware pieces inspired by the brand's former womenswear head Maria Grazia Chiuri's Dioriviera collection. Rooted in travel and reinvention, the storied motifs have been translated into elegant interiors by Dior Maison. The Toile de Jouy Palms print, already seen on bags and ready-to-wear, now adorns a rounded vase crafted by enamelling specialists, Manufacture des Emaux de Longwy. Meanwhile, the signature cannage weave steps off handbags and on to a sleek side table, set in Perspex, and a beach mat ready for stylish escapes. Bvlgari Bvlgari watch turns 50 To mark the 50th anniversary of perhaps its best-known watch, the Bvlgari Bvlgari, the Italian house has unveiled four new variations. Launched in 1975 and reimagined by master watch designer Gérald Genta in 1977, the design remains true to its Roman roots, featuring a signature engraved bezel and minimalist dial. Offered in two sizes – 26mm and 38mm – each features a unique marble dial. The smaller version houses a Solotempo automatic movement, while the larger is powered by the calibre BVL 191."

myy62cd,2025-06-21 06:53:40,en,REDDIT,"  I think you would need a rotating cast of protagonists (ala Game of Thrones) that change every season. Season One would feature Fingolfin and Feanor, Thingol and Melian, Melkor and Finwe, and to a lesser extent, Finarfin, Sauron, Galadriel, Aredhel, Elenwe, Turgon, Fingon, Finrod, Maedhros, Caranthir and Curufin, and would begin with a movie style Prologue/Recap and pick-up the action with the Unrest of the Noldor, then end with the Noldor fanning out across Beleriand and beginning to found realms for themselves (Caranthir meeting the Naugrim), while mortal men begin to migrate westward. Season Two would pick up with the Noldorian realms in their early bloom, showing the armies of Hithlum triumphant over Orc hordes, then begin with Turgon and Finrod on their expedition and their dreams. It would feature Fingolfin, Fingon, Turgon, and Aredhel, Finrod, Idril and Gil-Galad, and to a lesser extent Thingol, Melian, Galadriel, Celeborn, Luthien, Mablung, Beleg, Eol (for 2-3 episodes), Maeglin (for maybe 2 episodes), Beor (for 2 episodes) Haleth (for 1), Hador (for 1), Barahir and Beren (for 2), and Hurin and Huor and Morwen (for 2.) The season would end with a 2-part Dagor Bragollach and the Fall of Fingolfin. Season Three would star Fingon and Maedhros and Hurin and Huor and Morwen and Gwindor throughout (and to a lesser extent Maglor), with Beren and Luthien and Thingol and Melian and Finrod and Orodreth and Celegorm and Curufin and Sauron heavily featured in the first 3-4 episodes or so, and would begin with the eradication of Barahir's band and Beren's meeting with Luthien, with the Union of Maedhros happening midseason, and then a multi-episode Battle of Unnumbered Tears stretching throughout the last 2-3 episodes. Season Four would open with the childhoods of Turin and Tuor, and would feature Thingol, Melian, Morwen, Mablung, Beleg, Sauron, Glaurung, Orodreth, Finduilas, Nienor, Mim, Voronwe, Turgon, Maeglin, Idril, Glorfindel, and Ecthelion (to a lesser extent Dior, Beren and Luthien, Galadriel and Celeborn, child Elwing and child Earendil, Gil-Galad and Cirdan, Morgoth and Huor.) The Children of Hurin would make up the first 3-4 episodes (with Tuor's youth and journey to Nevrast and meeting Ulmo and Voronwe and journeying to Gondolin significant in the background), Tuor's  growth to prominence in Gondolin and his romance w/ Idril and birth of Earendil and betrayal of Magelin and the delving of the Secret Way in the background of the next 2-3 episodes in which Menegroth is twice sacked, and then the Fall of Gondolin sequence dominates the last three, ending with Glorfindel's sacrifice and the escape of the evacuees. The fifth and final season would begin with Tuor and Idril leading the refugees of Gondolin to the Mouths of Sirion and mingling with the refugees of Doriath, founding a harbor and building ships. Tuor and Idril should leave the show by the end of episode two, while Earendil and Elwing, Gil-Galad and Cirdan, Maedhros and Maglor, and in later episodes a young Elrond and Elros, would comprise the main cast. The story here is much thinner than in other parts of the Silmarillion, and lots of content would need to be added in the first few episodes to show the utterly defeated state of Elves, Dwarves, and Men at the start of the season, with the Feanorians hunting and fleeing from Orcs in Ossiriand and Gil-Galad and Cirdan harrying Orc bands squatting in Elven ruins along the coast, the romance of Earendil and Elwing and his building of boats and early sea voyaging, but should pick up a bit in like Ep 3/4 with the wedding of Earendil and Elwing, birth of Elrond and Elros, and when Maedhros and Maglor learn that a Silmaril is at the Havens of Sirion. The sack of the Havens should be midseason, after which the remaining episodes would feature Earendil and Elwing attempting to reach Valinor (a confrontation with a weak and starving--but still hideously terrifying--Ungoliant could make a fun/frightening episode capper during this sequence) with arrival at Valinor being the endcapper of the second-to-last episode, the arrival of the Host of the Valar on the shores of Middle-Earth the end of penultimate episode, and the founding of the new realms of Lindon and Eregion and Numenor (with Sauron menacing in the background) closing out the season and series finale."

La mode s'invite de plus en plus hors des musées spécialisés, dans de nouveaux écrins où elle peut se confronter à d'autres œuvres d'art, couleurs, tapisseries ou mobilier. La mode s'affirme comme un phénomène culturel et s'expose. Elle est considérée comme un art plus accessible où le vêtement n'est plus du tout perçu comme superficiel car la question du corps est plus centrale aujourd'hui dans l'identité, et particulièrement pour les jeunes générations. Ainsi ces derniers mois, Paris a accueilli, entre autres, Louvre Couture, Dolce & Gabbana, Azzedine Alaïa, Thierry Mugler. 1980-1990, Au fil de l'or. L'art de se vêtir de l'Orient au Soleil-Levant et Wax. Les régions n'ont pas été en reste avec, par exemple, S'habiller en artiste au Louvre-Lens, Le Jardin d'Hélène au Musée provençal du costume et du bijou à Grasse. Alors que Paris vibre au rythme de la Fashion Week masculine printemps-été 2026 (du 24 au 29 juin) et de la semaine de la haute couture automne-hiver 2025-2026 (du 7 au 10 juillet), en régions, des expositions consacrées aux créateurs méritent le détour. En voici huit pour vous régaler tout au long de cet été ! ""Élégance et modernité. L'Art déco a 100 ans !"" à Saint-Quentin L'Exposition internationale des Arts décoratifs et industriels modernes de 1925 à Paris, célébrant le design et l'innovation de l'époque, a marqué l'apogée du style Art déco, laissant une empreinte durable sur l'architecture, le design et les arts décoratifs. En 2025, pour célébrer son centenaire, Saint-Quentin organise Elégance et modernité. L'Art déco a 100 ans ! offrant l'opportunité de redécouvrir ce mouvement et son influence sur le patrimoine culturel, tout en mettant à l'honneur un siècle de créativité et d'élégance. Cette exposition prend place au cœur du Palais de l'Art déco, édifice emblématique de l'architecture Art déco de la ville. Elle est conçue comme une déambulation à travers les pavillons iconiques de l'Exposition de 1925 : le pavillon de l'Élégance, le pavillon des Diamantaires, le pavillon du Collectionneur. Le parcours met en lumière le savoir-faire des grandes maisons, dont certaines perdurent aujourd'hui comme Vuitton, Guerlain ou Lanvin, ainsi que les innovations artistiques et techniques qui ont contribué à la démocratisation du style Art déco dans la vie sociale. À travers une sélection de 300 œuvres et objets – bijoux, vêtements, cristallerie, orfèvrerie, mobilier et arts graphiques -, découvrez la diversité des styles et la richesse créative de cette période d'intense effervescence. Exposition ""Elégance et Modernité. l'art déco a 100 ans"", jusqu'au 21 septembre. Palais de l'Art Déco : 14, rue de la Sellerie. 78180 Saint-Quentin. Affiche de l'exposition ""Elégance et Modernité. L'art déco a 100 ans"" aux nouvelles Galeries de Saint-Quentin, le Palais de l'Art Déco inauguré en 1927. (DR) ""Dior. Jardins enchanteurs"" à Granville Depuis 1997, année d'ouverture au public de la maison d'enfance du couturier, le musée Christian Dior organise des expositions thématiques mettant en valeur ses créations et celles de ses successeurs. Plus de vingt ans après l'exposition Dior côté jardins en 2001, les jardins sont à nouveau à l'honneur. Essentiels dans la vie de Christian Dior, ils ont été une source d'influence majeure pour le couturier tant en matière de mode qu'en matière de parfums. À leur tour, les directeurs artistiques de la maison Dior aujourd'hui - directeur de la Création Parfums ainsi que les créateurs des accessoires, de la joaillerie ou encore des arts de la table - s'emparent des jardins qu'ils déclinent avec élégance et fantaisie. Cent vingt ans après la naissance de Christian Dior à Granville, relire le jardin de son enfance à travers le prisme de ses créations et celles de ses successeurs est une occasion de célébrer un créateur qui se disait autant parfumeur que couturier. Exposition ""Dior, jardins enchanteurs"", jusqu'au 2 novembre. Musée et jardin Christian Dior. Villa Les Rhumbs. 1, rue d'Estouteville. 50400 Granville. ""Yiqing Yin. D'air et de songes"" à Calais Cette exposition met en lumière l'hybridation des disciplines artistiques entre rêve et exploration des sens de Yiqing Yin. En invitant la première créatrice d'origine chinoise à recevoir l'appellation française de haute couture, le musée propose une immersion dans un travail d'une grande densité et délicatesse. À la croisée des arts, ses œuvres sculpturales et évanescentes tissent un dialogue entre la fragilité de l'humain et la force créatrice de la nature. Grand couturier, directrice artistique, créatrice de costumes et muse, Yiqing Yin est une artiste pluridisciplinaire reconnue internationalement. Le parcours de l'exposition invite à pénétrer au cœur du processus créatif, à saisir l'idée avant même la réalisation de la robe. Le hasard, l'inattendu et l'indéterminé sont les clefs du voyage sensoriel où l'œuvre se révèle.  L'artiste puise son inspiration dans le minéral, le végétal et l'animal, élaborant ainsi une poétique du vivant qui tisse le fil rouge de l'exposition. Chaque création se révèle comme un paysage onirique, où rêve et éveil des sens s'entrelacent en une esthétique de la métamorphose. Robes haute couture, images (photographies, films, dessins), textures sonores (murmures, bruissement d'air) et sillages olfactifs rythment ce parcours immersif, invitant à une exploration intime de son imaginaire.

4074d5293242eb65605f3ef7651e0d61,2025-06-21 11:31:00,ru,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[ru]Уже на следующей неделе состоится главная свадьба года — крупнейшая после бракосочетания сына индийского миллиардера Мукеша Амбани и Радхики Мерчант в 2024. Владелец Amazon Джефф Безос и светская львица Лорен Санчес объявили официальное место проведения — им стала Венеция. И пока жители города на воде выходят на протесты с громкими лозунгами «Здесь нет места для Безоса», организаторы продолжают готовить трехдневное свадебное торжество. Подробностей мало: имя дизайнера свадебного платья и список гостей в публичном поле существуют только в виде слухов и сплетен, курсирующих по модным изданиям. Рассказываем все, что на данный момент известно об этом событии. Свадьба года: что известно о торжестве Лорен Санчес и Джеффа Безоса Помолвка влюбленных оказалась очень приватной — в мае 2023 миллиардер сделал предложение Лорен на борту своей суперяхты Koru стоимостью в 500 миллионов долларов во время их отпуска на юге Франции. Санчес рассказывает, что жених положил кольцо под подушку, когда она готовилась ко сну. Авторство самого украшения неизвестно — скорее всего оно было изготовлено ювелирной компанией Lorraine Schwartz. Ранее их изделия надевали звезды А-листа, среди которых Бейонсе, Ким Кардашьян и Анджелина Джоли. Оценочная стоимость 30-каратного кольца с розовым алмазом в огранке «подушка» — от 3 до 5 миллионов долларов. В прошлом месяце в Париже состоялся девичник Лорен, на который прибыли ее самые ближайшие подруги. В мини-круизе по Сене оказались такие звезды как Кэти Пэрри (именно с ней Санчес отправлялась в 11-минутный полет в космос), Ким Кардашьян, Ева Лонгория и Крис Дженнер. Неожиданно, дресс-код был очень скромным: черное и белое. Так, сама Лорен надела двухцветное флоральное платье Oscar de la Renta, а Ким, которая в это время была в Париже из-за судебного процесса по делу об ограблении, отдала предпочтение атласной модели-бюстье John Galliano. Среди мест, посещенных свитой Санчез, значится крыша парижского отеля Cheval Blanc Paris, роскошный ресторан Lafayette, а также парижский маст-визит L'Avenue. Про саму свадьбу информации не так много. Единственный неопровержимый факт — она пройдет в Венеции в июне этого года, а не в Аспене, как уверяли нас анонимные источники, близкие к паре. Даже точные даты пока неизвестны: некоторые таблоиды говорят о трех днях с 24 по 26 июня, другие же утверждают, что только первый день празднования выпадет на 26 число. Еще один громкий слух, который сопровождает эту громкую свадьбу — Безос буквально «арендовал» город на воде под свое мероприятие. После того, как пользователи соцсетей заметили полную бронь водных такси на эти даты и отсутствие возможности покупки номеров отеля или квартир на AirBnB, в интернете началась настоящая паника. Вскоре она вышла и в офлайн — жители Венеции начали протесты против такого неправомерного использования общественного пространства. Однако пресс-секретари пары и мэр города уже успели предпринять попытку остановки нарастающего недовольства итальянцев и и уверить их, что городская инфраструктура во время торжества будет функционировать в штатном режиме. Где же конкретно пройдет бракосочетание? Есть несколько версий развития событий: первое — основная часть свадьбы случился на той самой яхте Безоса, которая пришвартуется к одному из венецианских причалов. К какому именно — неизвестно, поскольку внушительные габариты судна протяженностью 127 метров значительно сужают круг возможных вариантов. Еще одно предположение — остров Сан-Джорджо-Маджоре, расположенный напротив площади Сан-Марко. По слухам, торжество также охватит такие исторические здания как Scuola Grande della Misericordia и церковь Святого Георгия, где пройдет венчание. Известно, что Безос забронировал 5 самых элитных отелей Венеции — Aman Canal Grand Hotel, tDanieli, Belmond Cipriani, Gritti Palace и St. Regis — в которых расположится более 200 гостей. В их числе — Иванка Трамп, Кэти Пэрри, Барак Обама, Леонардо Ди Каприо, Орландо Блум, Джордж Клуни и Леди Гага и Элтон Джон. Последние два, скорее всего, исполнят на свадьбе свои хиты. Конечно, самый главный вопрос, который волнует фэшн-общественность — кто же займется дизайном свадебного платья? Точного ответа на него тоже нет, хотя на эту роль выдвигают таких мастодонтов модного мира как Dior, Oscar de la Renta (любимый бренд невесты!) и Dolce&Gabbana. Учитывая общий бюджет свадьбы, который оценивается примерно в 10-11 миллионов долларов — Лорен не будет мелочиться. За логистику и организацию торжества тоже не стоит переживать — ею занимается лондонское свадебное агентство Lanza & Baucina, которое также продюсировало бракосочетание Джорджа и Амалии Клуни. Остается лишь ждать условной даты праздника и следить за развитием событий на суперяхте Безоса — что-то нам подсказывает, что зрителей ждет много громких инфоповодов."

The award was presented on June 12 in Paris at leading European tech conference VivaTech, hosted by LVMH Image and Environment Director Antoine Arnault. Hugo Borensztein, co-founder and CEO of Omi, said the win reflects a broader shift happening across the luxury and retail industries. “Working with a Maison founded two centuries ago using the most advanced 3D and AI technologies expresses LVMH's bold, innovation-inspired vision. We are both honored and proud to be part of this adventure,"" Borensztein said in a statement by LVMH. Don't Miss: Omi specializes in using 3D technology to streamline content creation for luxury brands, reducing costs while elevating quality. Its tools allow for the scalable production of photorealistic visuals used in online retail and marketing, according to Omi's website. According to Vogue, the company has already worked with Guerlain, an LVMH-owned beauty house, on high-end product visual campaigns that merge legacy identity with modern production speed. L'Oréal also announced a collaboration with Omi during VivaTech, introducing a new visual design process powered by Omi's 3D AI platform, according to Forbes. The partnership is part of L'Oréal's broader AI strategy within its CREAITECH platform.

Now in its ninth year, the LVMH Innovation Award program spotlights startups that are shaping the future of the luxury ecosystem. According to LVMH, this year's competition featured three top prizes. Alongside Omi's win, the Best Business Award went to U.S.-based Kahoona for its personalization work with Dior. LVMH also announced that The Best Impact Prize was awarded to Genesis, a French startup collaborating with Moët Hennessy to digitally monitor and improve soil health in vineyards. LVMH Chair and CEO Bernard Arnault praised the finalists for their ""entrepreneurial spirit and hard work,"" adding that innovation remains central to the group's mission of excellence. ""Innovation has always energized the growth of our Maisons and their desirability. This innovation is not an end in itself, but rather a means to achieve excellence. I'm always delighted to meet these young entrepreneurs, and to see them working with our centuries-old Maisons and be recognized for their entrepreneurial spirit and hard work,"" Arnault said in the statement.

Omi says its technology allows brands to turn static product data into interactive 3D content that can be deployed across websites, e-commerce platforms, and social media. Rather than relying on traditional photography or slow post-production workflows, the platform generates high-fidelity visuals directly from 3D models, streamlining product rollout and campaign development. With LVMH recognizing Omi as a leader in innovation and a new partnership underway with L'Oréal, the startup may push brands a step toward broader adoption of AI-powered visual platforms in luxury.

Much of the sartorial magic created by global fashion brands is the handiwork of Indian karigars, as most of us are aware by now. The lives of those who make our clothes are not pretty, to say the least. It is a fragmented market where payouts are abysmally low, and working conditions are far from satisfactory. Until now, fashion manufacturing in India was equally unattractive. It used to run like a clunky machine, rigid and outdated. Factories were built for bulk, not quick pivots. Long lead times and massive MOQs (minimum order quantities) were the usual norms. And tech innovation in this space was barely a blip. The entire ecosystem was a slow-moving maze — opaque, outdated and not prone to change. Then, the world shifted. Post-Covid, everything from how people shop to what they want to buy has changed — and fast. Consumers today are a digital-first lot who are not just online; they are always on. They look for the latest trends and fresh styles, and they want it now. That pressure has lit a fire under the industry, and brands of all sizes are now replacing the old-school mass production model with nimble, tech-first systems that can turn on a dime. Fast fashion is no longer a trend; it is a demand. ZYOD Has Dared To Dream, But Is It Rising From Zero To One? For serial entrepreneur Ankit Jaipuria, a mechanical engineer from IIT Delhi, these shifts in consumer mindset and manufacturing timelines unveiled an opportunity. He joined forces with Ritesh Khandelwal, an alumnus of IIM Kashipur and founder of several startups, to establish ZYOD in January 2023. The B2B fashion manufacturing platform provides design-to-delivery solutions to local and global fashion brands, as well as direct-to-consumer (D2C) fashion businesses. It sources fabrics from reliable suppliers across the country and runs a marketplace, connecting local and global fashion brands with vetted Indian factories for fast and smooth production cycles. It has recently partnered with FAN MANIA, one of the largest consumer product licensees in the apparel and accessories space, to expand its presence in the licensed merchandise market. Although it is one the youngest players specialising in fashion manufacturing as a service, ZYOD is growing at a fast clip. After two years of its launch, the platform is operating in 40 countries and catering to more than 500 SMEs, 550+ D2C companies and 50+ global brands and fashion conglomerates such as the Landmark Group, Reliance Retail, NEXT, Walmart, Gymshark and more. Its key competitors include a host of new-age funded startups such as Fashinza, Groyyo, Zapero, Bijnis and Thimblerr. ZYOD collaborates with 50 tech professionals and designers to develop a catalogue of 10K+ unique styles per month. With lower MOQ thresholds for agility, the entire design-to-delivery process has been compressed into a 50-day cycle. At the centre of this ecosystem is a proprietary ERP programme for real-time visibility across operations, along with a host of technology solutions, including AI-driven forecasts of fashion trends, efficient line planning, streamlined manufacturing, and quality enhancement. It has also established three tech-powered excellence hubs in Gurugram (Delhi NCR) and Jaipur (Rajasthan) for technology integration, speed and sustainability (more on this later). The outcome: Brands can design and release their collections quickly and efficiently, with far less risk of unsold inventory. “You require manufacturing that evolves in real time,” said Jaipuria, emphasising the need for agility, data intelligence and sustainability. A traditional production cycle, ranging from 120-180 days, often leaves brands with designs that feel dated even before they hit the racks. In contrast, ZYOD can lower the MOQ as per requirement, a move that unlocks manufacturing for small brands without high upfront costs or excess inventory. That ZYOD has developed an innovative, right-sized and demand-driven workflow through process standardisation and quality integration is crucial not only for a fast-growing fashion industry but also for investors, as brands are often forced to write off huge unsold inventories due to product obsolescence. According to a report by The Guardian, around 10-40% of the 80-150 Bn garments globally produced every year are never sold. ZYOD aims to shrink that gap by giving brands the ability to test styles quickly, pivot production mid-cycle and maintain tighter control over what enters the supply chain. But the question is: Can a fledgling brand, buoyed by just two years of financial operations, be catapulted from zero to one due to its low MOQ and tech-powered sustainable manufacturing? A dive into ZYOD's capital inflows and revenue trajectory may offer early clues to its growing momentum in the fast-fashion supply chain. Since its launch, ZYOD has raised a total of $21.5 Mn across three rounds. The most recent infusion came in 2024 when it secured $18 Mn through a mix of equity and debt. The round was led by RTP Global, a VC firm backing technology-first, high-growth companies. An earlier round saw Lightspeed Venture Partners anchor a $3.5 Mn investment. Jaipuria also claimed that the platform clocked $20 Mn (INR 171.2 Cr, unaudited results) in FY25, a fourfold increase from the $5 Mn (INR 42.8 Cr) reported in the previous fiscal year.

tw_sl_c2e269a11f22b327a8d5772b41da05b9,2025-06-21 16:23:42,en,WEB,"  Eva Marie Uzcategui/ While her politics and choice of men might be up for debate, Melania Trump's beauty is simply undeniable. ""Melania's a great physical beauty,"" Donald Trump gushed to Tatler in 2005 about his international fashion model wife. ""In Palm Beach, I told her she could be the queen of this town, and the woman of society have fallen in love with her. They cannot believe her physical beauty."" Still, some aren't so sure that Melania's beauty is all au naturel. It's long been rumored that she's gone under the knife to achieve her bombshell looks. It should be noted, however, that as late as 2016, Melania was still maintaining that she had never had any work done and vowed that she never would. ""I'm against Botox, I'm against injections; I think it's damaging your face, damaging your nerves. It's all me. I will age gracefully, as my mom does,"" she declared during a candid interview with GQ, swiftly aligning herself with all of the other celebrities who refuse to get plastic surgery. But as the old saying goes, a picture is worth a thousand words, and, as for Melania, there are a few of her that sent plastic surgery chatter into overdrive. Melania Trump showed up at the 2024 RNC looking fresh as a daisy Leon Neal/ After being mostly a no-show during her famous husband's third presidential campaign, Melania Trump made quite the entrance when she showed up on stage for the final night of the 2024 Republican National Convention in Milwaukee, Wisconsin — even sharing a rare connection with her hubby when she gave him a loving and warm embrace. Unfortunately, even after dazzling the crowd in her all-red Dior suit, some couldn't help but point out what they perceived as a new look for Melania. Even plastic surgeon Dr. Gary Motykie joined the did-she-or-didn't-she group chat, telling the Daily Mail that he had ""noticed a change in her nose."" According to Motykie, ""Noses don't typically get smaller as they get older, they get bigger — but hers is definitely smaller and more defined, so I am very suspicious for at least one rhinoplasty [nose job]."" He also noted that she's probably benefiting from some ""maintenance work,"" including Botox and fillers. Melania Trump hid behind a pair of oversized sunglasses on election day Chip Somodevilla/ All eyes were on Melania Trump and her husband, presidential hopeful Donald J. Trump, when they arrived at the Mandel Recreation Center in Palm Beach, Florida, to cast their ballots on November 5, 2024. Still, she had a workaround to keep onlookers from peering directly at her: a pair of oversized black sunglasses. ""She tends to wear sunglasses and hats to shield herself from the public eye. As she's stated in previous interviews, she often feels as though she is being bullied,"" Professor and fashion psychologist Dr. Dawnn Karen told Express in 2019 about Melania's dependence on her expensive hater blockers. ""I believe that the hat serves as armour of some sort. When she's looking out into the audience, she cannot see the entire crowd due to her sunglasses or her hat."" Others, however, thought there might be another reason Melania kept her sunglasses on while indoors. Cosmetic plastic surgeon Dr. Dennis Schimpf speculated that she ""probably had additional filler work done"" ahead of the election in an effort to be camera-ready. ""She could have had some undereye and cheek filler. That often causes bruising, so it makes sense that she would be wearing sunglasses,"" he explained to the Daily Mail. Alexa, play ""I Wear My Sunglasses at Night"" by Corey Hart. Melania Trump blocked most of her face from sight on Inauguration Day Chip Somodevilla/ Did Melania Trump have a little something-something day in the days leading up to her hubby's second inauguration? As you may recall, Melania showed up to the occasion donning a large-and-in-charge hat that shielded her face from even the most eagle-eyed onlookers. ""What was Melania hiding under her hat? I think it was a rabbit,"" one X user speculated. Some believe that Melania recycled the bizarre fashion accessory at the inauguration to dodge her famous hubby's kisses, but it's entirely possible she was just hiding her latest beauty tweaks. Board-certified plastic surgeon Dr. Sean McNally told the Daily Express U.S. that the second-time FLOTUS' jaw line looked ""absolutely snatched for someone who's 54."" According to McNally, there could be a few reasons for her stellar side profile, including her naturally ""amazing skin"" or some ""minimally-invasive skin tightening treatments."" Still, he was careful to point out some very subtle signs that she had just gone under the knife. ""If you look real close there's two things to note. (1) Her earlobe has what we call a pixie shape. (2) There appears to be a very faint light line just in front of her ear running down to the edge of her earlobe."" Advertisement"

Because another early 2000s trend (that took off in the 1980s) is back on the rise. And this time, it's the double polo shirt that has crept out of your Abercrombie & Fitch/Hollister coffins and returned with a vengeance. If you were a “prep” in the early noughties, you are all too familiar with the struggle of layering your favorite polos — popping not one, not two, but maybe even three collars. TikTok has been raving about this trend for a while now, and I have received news from L.A. and New York that this look has been spotted out in public. It even appeared on the spring/summer 2025 runways of Rhude, Craig Green, and Balenciaga. If you do want to try this trend, I suggest you begin with a lighter fabric polo as your base to ease the layering (and heat) of another polo — or two. Rhude layered polo lookcourtesy Rhude LUST FOR LINEN Is it just me, or does anyone else think of linen as a fabric that belongs to an older clientele? That familiar khaki linen almost screams Tommy Bahama and a fold-out beach chair. Well, if you do, it's time to snap out of it. Not only is this fabric the most breathable in warmer days, but designers have honed in on pushing this lightweight, breathable cloth down the runways. Brands like Dior, Zegna, and Dunhill have sent down models in khaki linen suits, whereas Magliano opted for black linens, and Dolce & Gabbana sent out a slew of white linen looks. Walking down Fifth Avenue recently, I spotted linen suits in black and white at many of your well-known retailers. So sit back, relax, and feel the summer breeze in an easy linen suit — because it's cool to dress like your dad again. Dolce & Gabbana white linen lookcourtesy Dolce & Gabbana BET ON BOXERS The debate of boxers versus briefs has riddled the menswear community for decades. Of course, your comfort matters. In our community, it's not limited to boxers or briefs! However, the trend report has been showing an increase in boxers being worn — and shown — as midriffs as temperatures rise. High-end brands such as Gucci, Versace, and Dior have been making boxers with their illustrious logos on the waistband, so why wouldn't you want to show that off with a little sneak peek? ERL's spring/summer 2025 collection showed us the sexy “Marky Mark” way to do this, but you can always opt for just feeling the breeze and not letting anyone know what's going on down there. ERL exposed boxers lookcourtesy ERL THE SUMMER OF LABUBU These cute little plush dolls, hailing from Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung, aren't just for your girlfriend's purse anymore. The Labubu craze has taken full effect on everyone in the U.S., ranging from kids to grandparents and anyone in between (even straight teenage boys). The handbag charm craze has been taking the world by storm, but it's time to make (even more) room for these soda can-sized dolls. They come in every color of the rainbow, and some have cute little outfits! Attach them to your man purse, messenger bag, or even your backpack as these dolls are heading toward a collectible and maybe unattainable category.

Axşam.az xəbər verir ki, o, görünüşünü mərhum kraliça II Elizavetaya məxsus ""Raspberry Pip"" broşu və Filip Treysiyə məxsus tüklü şlyapa ilə tamamlayıb. Amma ictimaiyyətin diqqətini çəkən əsas aksesuar — Kamillanın əlində tutduğu açıq rəngli ""Lady Dior"" çantası olub. ""Dior""un rəsmi saytında bu çanta haqqında qeyd olunur: ""Məşhur ""Lady Dior"" çantası hər zaman Uels şahzadəsi, Ledi Diana ilə bağlı olacaq. 1995-ci ilin sentyabrında Parisdə Böyük Sarayda Pol Sezan retrospektivinin açılışında Fransanın birinci xanımı Bernadet Şirak ona hələ rəsmi olaraq satışa çıxarılmamış və o vaxtlar 'Chouchou' adlanan ""Dior"" çantasını hədiyyə edib. Bu çanta qısa müddətdə Diananın imzasına çevrilib: o, müxtəlif rəng və ölçülərdə sifariş verir, həm rəsmi tədbirlərdə, həm də gündəlik çıxışlarında istifadə edirdi. 1996-cı ildə ""Dior"" bu modeli rəsmən ""Lady Dior"" adlandırıb. Kral III Çarlz, Diana və Kamilla arasında olan mürəkkəb münasibətlər fonunda Kamillanın bu çantanı seçməsi sosial şəbəkələrdə birmənalı qarşılanmayıb. Bəzi istifadəçilər bunu ""uyğunsuz"" və ""hörmətsizlik"" adlandırıblar. ""The Crown"" adlı teleqram kanalında yazılıb: ""Yaxşı, nə olar, Kamilla Çarlzı əlindən aldı — keçdi, getdi. Amma ""Lady Dior""un ürəklərin kraliçasının adını daşıyan çantası ilə görünmək xəyanətin zirvəsidir"". Xatırladaq ki, şahzadə Çarlz (indiki kral III Çarlz) və Diana Spenser 1981-ci ildə evləniblər. Onların iki oğlu olub — Uilyam və Harri. Lakin Çarlzın Kamilla Parker-Boulz ilə davam edən münasibətləri onların nikahını gərginləşdirib. 1992-ci ildə ayrı yaşamağa başlayıblar, 1996-cı ildə isə rəsmi olaraq boşanıblar. Bir il sonra, 1997-ci ildə, Diana Parisdə avtomobil qəzasında vəfat edib. Kamilla isə o vaxta qədər Endryu Parker-Boulz ilə evli olub. O, Çarlzla 2005-ci ildə Vindsorda bələdiyyə binasında keçirilən mülki nikah mərasimi ilə evlənib.

Her lifestyle show was boring and didn't know what it wanted to be and honestly I don't know what she wanted it to be either. Hollywood didn't knock on her door beyond Netflix who can't seem to take a hint that Meghan's star is not as bright anymore. Also had she not married Harry she would just be another actress with fleeting success."

Nick Saban is his favorite all-time coach, while Baker Mayfield and Caitlin Clark are his favorite players. Prasen considers Vince Young coming up clutch for the Texas Longhorns in the dying seconds of the 2017 national championship game against the USC Trojans as the most iconic moment of all time.

She's the queen in New York, because I wanted to make the story about David Bowie coming to the city of New York. Iman is the queen, and she's waiting for the Duke to rescue her, and she's been waiting for a thousand years. But when I told that to Iman, she said that in real life that would never happen. [Laughs] She'd never wait that long. Yes, I am a David Bowie fan, but this didn't happen just because I'm a fan. The idea came about because all the characters are wearing actual fashion brands, like Christian Dior, which actually exists in real life. I went to see a fashion show, and saw all the models posing in the clothes, which I drew as a sketch, and eventually turned it into a full painting."

216900545_849,2025-06-22 09:07:57,en,WORDPRESS,"  The world of fragrance is filled with intriguing classifications, but few are as historically rich and olfactorily distinct as ""chypre."" With the re-emergence of the niche scent <em><strong><a href=""https://talkfragrance.com/perfume-chypre-sublime-eternal-classic-perfumes/"">Chypre Sublime</a></strong></em>, fragrance lovers are once again exploring the depth and elegance of this complex scent family. But what exactly is the <em><strong>chypre meaning</strong></em>? And why has <em><strong>Chypre Sublime</strong></em> captivated modern noses while drawing inspiration from a classic tradition? In this article, we'll unpack the true essence of “chypre,” look into the elements that define the category, and explore how modern interpretations like <em><strong>Chypre Sublime</strong></em> breathe new life into a timeless fragrance structure. <hr /> <h3>What Is the True <em>Chypre Meaning</em>? </h3> The <em><strong>chypre meaning</strong></em> refers to a distinct perfume classification that originated from the French word for Cyprus, an island historically associated with rich aromatic materials like oakmoss, labdanum, and cistus. While perfumes had existed long before the 20th century, it was <strong>François Coty</strong> who codified the “chypre” structure with his groundbreaking 1917 creation <em>Chypre de Coty</em>. A traditional chypre fragrance is known for its three-part structure: <ul><li><strong>Top Notes</strong>: Bright citrus, usually bergamot. </li><li><strong>Middle Notes</strong>: Floral heart (such as rose, jasmine, or ylang-ylang). </li><li><strong>Base Notes</strong>: Earthy and mossy, with oakmoss, patchouli, labdanum, and sometimes animalic or leathery tones. </li></ul> The result is a scent that starts crisp and fresh, evolves into a floral middle, and finishes dry, mossy, and sensual. The <em><strong>chypre meaning</strong></em> is thus rooted in this complex interplay of light and dark, elegance and power, freshness and mystery. <hr /> <h3>The Evolution and Reinvention of Chypre</h3> Over the decades, the chypre family has evolved. As IFRA (International Fragrance Association) regulations limited the use of natural oakmoss, perfumers began innovating with synthetic substitutes and new aromatic woods, still preserving the chypre's identity. This modern reinterpretation gave rise to popular subfamilies such as: <ul><li><strong>Fruity Chypre</strong> – e.g., <em>Dior Miss Dior</em></li><li><strong>Floral Chypre</strong> – e.g., <em>Narciso Rodriguez for Her</em></li><li><strong>Green Chypre</strong> – e.g., <em>Chanel Cristalle</em></li><li><strong>Woody Chypre</strong> – e.g., <em>Armani Privé</em></li></ul> It's in this era of reinterpretation that <em><strong>Chypre Sublime</strong></em> enters the spotlight. <hr /> <h3>Unveiling <em>Chypre Sublime</em>: A Modern Ode to Tradition</h3> <em><strong>Chypre Sublime</strong></em> is a luxurious perfume that embraces the core DNA of a traditional chypre while modernizing it with refined ingredients and elegant composition. Released by niche perfume houses such as <strong>Floral Street</strong> and interpreted by high-end indie perfumers, <em><strong>Chypre Sublime</strong></em> represents a return to the complex, layered perfumes of the past—with a contemporary twist. What sets <em><strong>Chypre Sublime</strong></em> apart? <ul><li><strong>Refined Citrus Opening</strong>: Uses bergamot or mandarin for freshness. </li><li><strong>Floral Heart</strong>: A rich bouquet of rose, iris, and violet, often paired with spices like pink pepper. </li><li><strong>Sophisticated Base</strong>: Includes oakmoss (synthetic or natural extract), patchouli, amber, and musk. </li></ul> The beauty of <em><strong>Chypre Sublime</strong></em> lies in how seamlessly these elements blend, making it wearable for all genders and perfect for all seasons. It is a scent that whispers class rather than shouting trend. <hr /> <h3>How <em>Chypre Sublime</em> Upholds the <em>Chypre Meaning</em></h3> Unlike many modern perfumes that prioritize sweetness or minimalism, <em><strong>Chypre Sublime</strong></em> stays true to the depth and transformation that define the <em><strong>chypre meaning</strong></em>. It reflects the genre's: <ul><li><strong>Complexity</strong>: A fragrance that evolves noticeably over hours. </li><li><strong>Sophistication</strong>: Appeals to seasoned noses and fragrance connoisseurs. </li><li><strong>Heritage</strong>: A direct lineage to early 20th-century French perfumery. </li></ul> By evoking this rich tradition, <em><strong>Chypre Sublime</strong></em> becomes a tribute, not just a trend—a bold statement of elegance in a world of fleeting scents. <hr /> <h3>When to Wear <em>Chypre Sublime</em></h3> Because of its rich and evolving nature, <em><strong>Chypre Sublime</strong></em> is especially suitable for: <ul><li><strong>Evening wear</strong>: Its warm base notes blossom beautifully in cooler night air. </li><li><strong>Professional settings</strong>: Subtle yet commanding, it's ideal for making a strong yet refined impression. </li><li><strong>Autumn and Winter</strong>: The mossy, spicy elements resonate beautifully in colder months...."

Jeff Bezos (61), milliardenschwerer Tech-Romeo, heiratet seine Jetset-Julia Lauren Sánchez (54). Dort, wo schon Casanova (1725–1798) küsste und George Clooney (64) tanzte. Venedig wird zum Schauplatz einer Liebesoperette, samt Lagunenblick und Bellini-Schwips. Es wird gefeiert, gegondelt – und schon jetzt getuschelt. 3 Tage Hochzeitssause, 9 Jachten, 27 Braut-Looks, 250 Gäste. Und kein Platz für Zurückhaltung! Jeff Bezos: 3 Tage Hochzeits-Marathon Wann genau das Paar sich traut? Top secret! Klar ist nur: Zwischen dem 24. und 28. Juni soll das VIP-Spektakel steigen. Am ersten Tag rauschen die Gäste an – per Wassertaxi, Helikopter oder Limousine. Die „Welcome-Dinner“ sollen in Gruppen u. a. in Hotels wie dem „Excelsior“ (Superior-Zimmer ab ca. 1768 Euro/Nacht) stattfinden. Im „Belmond Cipriani“ (ca. 2440 Euro/Nacht) wird Lady Gaga vermutet, die laut „Daily Mail“ auch für musikalische Unterhaltung sorgt. Am Folgetag sind offenbar private Bootstouren geplant, gefolgt von Dinner-Partys auf den ankernden Luxusschiffen. Denn: Neben seinem Segel-Schloss „Koru“ (127 Meter, 500 Mio. Dollar) samt Begleitschiff „Abeona“ hat der Amazon-Alpha angeblich 7 weitere Jachten in Stellung gebracht! Wie die italienische Tageszeitung „Corriere della Sera“ berichtet, sollen sie als Event-Set-up rund um San Basilio, Zattere, Punta della Dogana und Riva degli Schiavoni liegen. Und auch als Schutzschild gegen Störmanöver dienen. Die Hochzeit selbst findet Insidern zufolge auf der Insel San Giorgio Maggiore statt. Zur Feier könnte die Gesellschaft dann Richtung Renaissance-Perle Scuola Grande della Misericordia schippern. Auch der Palazzo Pisani Moretta wird hoch gehandelt. Der Inhalt ist leider nicht mehr verfügbar. Bezos und Sánchez sollen für ihre Gäste 30 Motorboote gemietet haben. Und 3 Lkw mit exotischen Pflanzen wurden bereits auf dem Weg nach Venedig gesichtet. Kostenpunkt der epischen Ehe-Inszenierung? Zwischen 10 und 30 Millionen Dollar! Lauren Sánchez plant 27 Looks für 72 Stunden Da wird auch Fashion-mäßig aus dem Vollen geschöpft. Gerüchten zufolge hat sich die Braut 27 Outfits für die 3 Tage maßschneidern lassen. In der US-„Vogue“ nannte sie Dior, Valentino oder Versace als Traumdesigner. Und verriet in der „Today Show“, dass sie auf Social Media Inspirationen gesammelt hat: „Ich bin wie jede andere Braut, natürlich habe ich auch ein Pinterest Board. “ Nur eben mit fettem Finanz-Spielraum. Proteste auf der Piazza! In all die Euphorie mischt sich aber auch Empörung. Die Bürgerinitiative „No Space for Bezos“ protestiert mit Bannern auf der Rialto-Brücke, Plakaten im Zentrum und Booten vor der Bucht. Die Botschaft: „Wir haben nichts gegen Liebe. Aber etwas gegen Luxus-Landnahme! “ Sie wollen nicht, dass Venedig zum Disneyland für Milliardäre wird – und drohen, die Kanäle zu besetzen. „Er soll Venedig nicht mit Las Vegas verwechseln“, ätzte ein Aktivist in der Zeitung „La Repubblica“ gegen Jeff Bezos. Es gärt in der Gondelgesellschaft. Bürgermeister Luigi Brugnaro (63) spricht hingegen von einer „Ehre für Venedig“ – und sieht die Chance, Handwerk und Schönheit der Stadt ins Rampenlicht zu rücken. 80 Prozent der Hochzeitsausstattung sollen lokal geliefert werden. So stellt die älteste Konditorei vor Ort, Rosa Salva, Geschenkboxen für die Hochzeitsgäste zusammen. Das Designstudio Laguna B kreiert mundgeblasenes venezianisches Muranoglas. Masterminds hinter diesem Konzept? Die Londoner Agentur Lanza & Baucina, die schon die Clooney-Trauung 2014 in Venedig schaukelte. Die Gästeliste – ein Promi-Potpourri! Gerechnet wird mit bis zu 250 Gästen aus Hollywood & High Society. Darunter Oprah Winfrey (71), Orlando Bloom, Bill Gates (69) und Diane von Fürstenberg. Auch US-Präsident Donald Trump (79) und First Lady Melania (55) sollen eingeladen worden sein...."

mov_7133BDA74999A9D6794CE1B55921EBED,2025-06-22 15:27:10,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Andrew Limbong, anfitrión: Hablemos de bolsillos por un segundo. Cuando uso un traje, tengo dos bolsillos delanteros y dos bolsillos traseros en mis pantalones. En mi chaqueta, tengo los dos bolsillos en el costado, y ahí está el bolsillo del pecho. Por lo general, hay otros dos o tres bolsillos en el interior. Y además, generalmente hay un bolsillo en mi camisa. Pero aquí está el pequeño secreto sucio. No llevo tantas cosas. Ahora, mi esposa, por otro lado, cuando encuentra un vestido que le gusta con solo dos bolsillos, es como si hubiera desenterrado una joya rara y valiosa de las profundidades de la tierra. Ahora, ¿por qué estoy balbuceando sobre los bolsillos? ¿Qué dice esta disparidad de género de bolsillo sobre nosotros como sociedad? Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson: Así que realmente existe esta historia fascinante e esclarecedora sobre por qué las mujeres no pueden tener bolsillos en su ropa hasta el día de hoy. Limbong: Esa es Elizabeth Evitts Dickinson. Ella acaba de escribir un libro titulado “Claire McCardell: la diseñadora que libera a las mujeres”. Se trata del diseñador de moda que, en las décadas de 1930 y 1940, revolucionó la forma en que pensamos sobre la ropa de las mujeres, incluidos los bolsillos. Dickinson: McCardell siempre entendió la psicología de la ropa. Ella entendió cómo se sentía moverse por el mundo, y a veces necesitabas un lugar no solo para poner tus artículos, como tu lápiz labial y tus llaves, sino también para poner tus manos. Y entendió que era muy importante tener un bolsillo no solo en un par de pantalones, sino también en vestidos y faldas, y luchó para incluirlos en toda su ropa. Limbong: Nos reunimos con Dickinson en el Centro de Historia y Cultura de Maryland, que organiza una exhibición sobre el trabajo de McCardell. Entrando, se siente como una tienda por departamentos, alrededor de una docena de maniquíes que recubren las paredes, todos con diseños de McCardell. Tienen una silueta similar, equipada en la parte superior con una falda que fluye desde la cintura. Todos los diferentes tipos de colores y texturas. Escaneo la habitación y aterrizamos en un vestido de Popover. Dickinson: que es básicamente un vestido de envoltura, y creo que mucha gente piensa que Diane Von Furstenberg fue pionero en el vestido de envoltura. Limbong: Pero Dickinson dice que comenzó con McCardell. Esta versión es blanca con un patrón negro delgado. Entra en la cintura, con un cinturón simple, puedes atarte a un nudo. Dickinson: Entonces, durante la Segunda Guerra Mundial, hubo este desafío cada vez más difícil, ¿qué es lo que usan las mujeres? Esto fue algo que Claire McCardell hizo en 1942 como un vestido para que las mujeres se encendieran fácilmente mientras trabajaban en la casa, yendo a las fábricas y solo teniendo que cuidar sus vidas mientras sus cónyuges se desplegaron en el extranjero. Limbong: El vestido de Popover es elegante pero altamente funcional. Dickinson dice que eso es por diseño, literalmente. Dickinson: Realmente es un vestido de algodón muy simple que originalmente estaba destinado a aparecer sobre tu ropa existente, casi como un delantal de gran tamaño. Y Claire lo hizo de un material que rara vez se usaba en el desgaste de las mujeres en ese momento. Ella salió de mezclilla. Y el original tenía un bolsillo de gran parche porque quería que las mujeres tuvieran un lugar para poner una llana de jardín o una linterna cuando había ejercicios de apagón durante la guerra. Limbong: Este era un momento en que las mujeres se enfrentaban a un mundo nuevo, y necesitaban ropa funcional para ayudarlos a navegarlo, lo que incluye trajes de baño. Caminamos hasta una caja de vidrio. Cuenta con un traje de baño que McCardell diseñó por primera vez en 1936. Se ve bastante similar a un traje de baño de una pieza que puede encontrar hoy, con tal vez un poco más de cobertura en la parte trasera, excepto que está hecha de lana. Diré que la primera vez que vi esto, pensé, eso suena loco. Eso suena súper incómodo. No puedo concebir usar un traje de baño de lana. Pero luego leí tu libro, y en el contexto de lo que sucedía en Swimwear, un traje de baño de lana parecía una buena opción. Entonces (risas) Cuéntanos cómo llegó a ser esto. Dickinson: Realmente lo fue. Quiero decir, se llamaban trajes de baño originalmente por una razón porque se suponía que las mujeres debían usar casi, como, vestidos con faldas, y era solo para entrar y entrar y, ya sabes, darse un chapuzón. McCardell era una nadadora, y siempre quiso tener trajes de baño que se movieran con ella en el agua y en realidad sería algo en lo que podías nadar. No solo había trajes de baño de lana, sino que en los años 20, había medias de natación de lana. Se le exigió que una mujer te cubra las piernas en las playas públicas. Y McCardell, ella no creía en eso en absoluto...."

mov_737DA27730ACFC800D563986FE860962,2025-06-23 06:15:21,en,WEB,"  Haute couture is a French word that means high fashion. But it is not just about expensive clothes. It is about art. These are clothes made by hand for one single person using the best quality fabric and the most skilled stitching. No machines. No mass production. Just creativity and craftsmanship. Every piece is designed with care, often taking weeks or even months to complete. From the first sketch to the final fitting, everything is done with extreme attention to detail. Each garment reflects the designer's vision and tells a unique story. Haute couture is where fashion becomes personal, emotional, and timeless, made not just to wear, but to be remembered. Many young designers begin their journey toward this level of creativity by enrolling in a good fashion design course in Kolkata, where they learn the skills needed to turn imagination into reality.

Last week, Kering, the owner of Gucci, appointed Renault's Luca de Meo as its new CEO. He will take over from Francois-Henri Pinault who has been at the helm since 2005. The move comes as the company navigates its financial challenges.

Earlier this month, Dior, owned by LVMH, appointed its menswear designer Jonathan Anderson as the head of womenswear designs and haute couture. He replaced Maria Grazia Chiuri.

mov_EB7F75E6418AACF5AB52CECE46965668,2025-06-23 07:21:29,en,WEB,"  Perfume is more than just a scent — it's a personal signature, a memory trigger, and a form of invisible luxury. While mainstream designer scents often dominate the market, niche perfume oils have carved out a special space among fragrance lovers who crave uniqueness, complexity, and longevity. In this blog, we explore top niche perfume oils, breaking down why they're worth the hype, how they differ from commercial fragrances, and the top picks you should absolutely try. Why Niche Perfume Oils Are So Coveted? 1. Artistry Over Mass Appeal Niche fragrances aren't made to please everyone, and that's the point. These creations often prioritize artistic expression and storytelling over broad commercial success. Each perfume oil tells a story through complex note structures and unexpected combinations, perfect for someone who doesn't want to smell like the crowd. Niche brands typically produce in small batches, often using artisanal methods. This craftsmanship makes every drop of perfume oil feel more exclusive and carefully curated. 2. High Oil Concentration = Better Longevity Most niche fragrance oils are formulated with a higher percentage of essential oils. This makes perfume oils far more long-lasting, richer, and closer to the skin. Oils like Desert Oud or Royal Amber can last 12+ hours, evolving beautifully throughout the day. With no alcohol in most perfume oils, evaporation is slower, allowing the scent to develop naturally and maintain its intensity. 3. Rare Ingredients and Unusual Compositions Niche brands are known for using hard-to-find or exotic ingredients — saffron, oud, ambergris, and even ancient resins. This uniqueness not only elevates the olfactory experience but also ensures your fragrance won't be worn by everyone else in the room. For instance, ingredients like oud from Cambodia, iris butter, or smoked birch tar can be found in niche oils and are rarely used in mass-market scents. 4. Better for Layering and Personalization Perfume oils are ideal for layering, allowing users to blend scents and create their own unique signature. GenericPerfumes makes this easy with oils inspired by luxury houses like Tom Ford, Creed, Maison Francis Kurkdjian, and more. Layering recommendations: How Are Niche Perfume Oils Different from Designer Perfumes? In addition to these differences, niche perfume oils have a greater olfactory depth and change more noticeably over time due to fewer synthetic stabilizers. You're not just wearing a smell — you're wearing an evolving composition. Top Niche Perfume Oil Picks (Including Designer-Inspired Oils) 1. Desert Oud 2. Royal Amber 3. Tobacco Vanille 4. Creed Aventus Oil 5. White Jasmine Honorable Mentions: More Oils Worth Exploring These fragrances provide a luxurious scent profile at a more accessible price point thanks to oil-based formulations. How to Choose the Right Niche Perfume Oils? 1. Know Your Fragrance Families Are you into florals, woods, spices, or aquatics? Understanding your preferences helps narrow down your ideal scent. 2. Test Before You Commit..."

7dd727fd8f4bd29b663f732f00d9cf12,2025-06-23 08:51:00,en,WEB,"  The cost of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's upcoming nuptials has been 'revealed' and, as you'd probably expect, the pair are seemingly going all out. Bezos and Sanchez got engaged in May 2023 and are finally set to tie the knot this week, according to reports. The duo are said to be marrying in Venice, Italy, on Saturday (June 27). Many A-listers are expected to attend their wedding; from Katy Perry and Oprah Winfrey, to Mick Jagger and Ivanka Trump. Advert Last year it was reported that the pair were spending a staggering $600 million on their nuptials, but the Amazon founder later refuted these claims. But new reports have suggested that Bezos and Sanchez could be forking out anywhere between $15 million to $20 million, per Mail Online. Speaking on this large sum, Kunal Madan, the CEO and Founder of DressPreservation.com, and Zoe Buke, from Hitched.co.uk, said it's likely that the famous pair will pay as much as much as $5 million for a private set from a high-profile performer like Beyoncé or Andrea Bocelli. Advert Then there's transport. Sanchez and Bezos are rumored to have invited 200 guests to their wedding, all of whom will need help getting to their wedding. Madan shared: ""Private jet travel for clients, superyacht transfers, or helicopter landings, transport arrangements for A-listers can vary from $500,000 to $2 million, depending on security and logistics."" Buke added that the couple's high profile guests will probably be put up in luxury 5-star accommodation. Then, of course, there's Sanchez's dress, the cost of which 'can easily surpass $1 million', say the experts. Advert ""Couture wedding dresses alone run $500,000 to $1 million, not to speak of a one-off haute couture wedding dress by Dior, Valentino, or Elie Saab, and with several wardrobe changes,"" said Madan. ""Accessories, custom suits for Bezos, and styling personnel drive it up."" Buke also pointed out that the couple's fits are likely to be bespoke. According to The Telegraph, Dolce & Gabbana is the favorite fashion house for Sanchez's dress, while Oscar de la Renta, Vera Wang, and Givenchy may also be in the running. Other things noted in the round-up of costs include floristry and decor, photography, catering, wedding favors, and a wedding planner. Advert Reportedly, they are sourcing some 80 percent of their wedding provisions from Venetian vendors as a way to share their appreciation for the city, says PA. While the celebrity couple and their guests will be excited about the pending wedding, not everyone is pleased.

mov_6F54F55C5B855D12032543CBC5474AD4,2025-06-23 08:51:51,en,WEB,"  The cost of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's upcoming nuptials has been 'revealed' and, as you'd probably expect, the pair are seemingly going all out. Bezos and Sanchez got engaged in May 2023 and are finally set to tie the knot this week, according to reports. The duo are said to be marrying in Venice, Italy, on Saturday (June 27). Many A-listers are expected to attend their wedding; from Katy Perry and Oprah Winfrey, to Mick Jagger and Ivanka Trump. Last year it was reported that the pair were spending a staggering $600 million on their nuptials, but the Amazon founder later refuted these claims. But new reports have suggested that Bezos and Sanchez could be forking out anywhere between $15 million to $20 million, per Mail Online. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez have been engaged to be married since May 2023 (Andreas Rentz/amfAR/ for amfAR) Speaking on this large sum, Kunal Madan, the CEO and Founder of DressPreservation.com, and Zoe Buke, from Hitched.co.uk, said it's likely that the famous pair will pay as much as much as $5 million for a private set from a high-profile performer like Beyoncé or Andrea Bocelli. Then there's transport. Sanchez and Bezos are rumored to have invited 200 guests to their wedding, all of whom will need help getting to their wedding. Madan shared: ""Private jet travel for clients, superyacht transfers, or helicopter landings, transport arrangements for A-listers can vary from $500,000 to $2 million, depending on security and logistics."" Buke added that the couple's high profile guests will probably be put up in luxury 5-star accommodation. Then, of course, there's Sanchez's dress, the cost of which 'can easily surpass $1 million', say the experts. Reportedly the couple are set to say their 'I dos' on June 27 (Marc Piasecki/WireImage) ""Couture wedding dresses alone run $500,000 to $1 million, not to speak of a one-off haute couture wedding dress by Dior, Valentino, or Elie Saab, and with several wardrobe changes,"" said Madan. ""Accessories, custom suits for Bezos, and styling personnel drive it up."" Buke also pointed out that the couple's fits are likely to be bespoke. According to The Telegraph, Dolce & Gabbana is the favorite fashion house for Sanchez's dress, while Oscar de la Renta, Vera Wang, and Givenchy may also be in the running. Other things noted in the round-up of costs include floristry and decor, photography, catering, wedding favors, and a wedding planner. Reportedly, they are sourcing some 80 percent of their wedding provisions from Venetian vendors as a way to share their appreciation for the city, says PA. Bezos' Venetian wedding has sparked protests in the city (ANDREA PATTARO/AFP via ) While the celebrity couple and their guests will be excited about the pending wedding, not everyone is pleased. The lavish affair has attracted the attention of protesters, who on Thursday (June 19) hung a banner on St Mark's bell tower with Bezos's name crossed out.

mov_CA0CF1581057A3CEE02CC2ADCE955D75,2025-06-23 09:01:53,en,WEB,"  Northern Irish designer Jonathan Anderson is set to present his first menswear collection for Dior on 27 June, and he's just given fashion fans a hint at what his vision at the storied French fashion house might look like. Anderson was first announced as the head of menswear in April, and later replaced Maria Grazia Chiuri as the head of womenswear in early June. His workload has already made headlines, with responsibility over ready-to-wear and haute couture collections, for both men and women, as well as pre-collections and an annual destination cruise show. On top of this, Anderson will also continue his work on his eponymous label, JW Anderson. With this in mind, fashion fans have been waiting with bated breath for the first hint of what his designs will look like. Over the weekend, Anderson offered a sneak peek at his inspirations for the upcoming show as well as a revamp of a much-loved accessory. Anderson has reimagined the iconic Dior Book Tote, taking inspiration from famous works of literature. One tote features an homage to the original cover of Bram Stoker's Dracula, the Irish Gothic classic, with a bright yellow background and striking red text. Another pale pink design references Choderlos de Laclos' 18th century classic Les Liaisons Dangereuses, which tells the story of two amoral French nobles who delight in manipulating people for their own enjoyment. The final reinterpretation of the Book Tote honoured Christian Dior himself, featuring Dior on Dior, a memoir the designer wrote about his development of the fashion house. Anderson also shared images from his mood board for the upcoming collection, including portraits taken of socialite Lee Radziwill and artist Jean-Michel Basquiat, both taken by Andy Warhol. ""As I started out on this journey, I kept returning to these photographs of Basquiat and Radziwill who are both, for me, the epitome of style"", Anderson said."

Sadašnja supruga kralja Charlesa došla je u Royal Ascot noseći kultnu Dior torbu, koja je dobila ime po bivšoj supruzi sadašnjeg kralja i to nije moglo proći nezapaženo. Mnogima se ovo nije svidjelo, te tvrde da se Camilla ponizila zbog Diane. Posljednji dan prestižnih konjičkih utrka uljepšali su oni koji su ih otvorili - kralj Charles i njegova supruga. U odsutnosti Kate Middleton, kraljica Camilla bila je u prvom planu, a najviše pažnje privukao je detalj kojim je 'začinila' styling. Na događaju, koji se održava svake treće nedjelje u lipnju već više od tri stoljeća, u gradiću blizu Windsora, Camilla se pojavila u elegantnoj bijeloj kombinaciji, a najviše se ipak pričalo o bijeloj torbi koju je 1994. godine za poznatu francusku kuću dizajnirao tadašnji kreativni direktor Gianfranco Ferre. Torba se trebala zvati 'Chouchou', no no Diana je dobila prvi model torbe, koja još nije bila u prodaji, od Bernadette Chirac, supruge tadašnjeg francuskog predsjednika Jacquesa Chiraca. U čast princeze Diane, torbica je nazvana Lady Dior. Princeza ga je nosila na nekoliko događaja, uključujući i jedinu Met Galu kojoj je prisustvovala. Bilo je to 1996. godine, na svečanoj večeri posvećenoj legendarnom Christianu Dioru, kada je zablistala u božanstvenoj kreaciji Johna Galliana. Kultna torba poznata je po svom kompaktnom obliku, zaobljenim ručkama i praktičnim dimenzijama te je već dva desetljeća simbol kraljevskog stila. U međuvremenu se pojavilo više varijanti, ali prvi model je daleko najpopularniji. Zanimljivo je da ovo nije bio prvi put da je kraljica Camilla nosila torbicu Lady Dior. Prošle godine na Wimbledonu imala je istu torbu, ali u bež verziji, piše Žena Blic. Sljedeća vijest"

Miliardarul american Jeff Bezos (61 de ani) și aleasa inimii lui Lauren Sánchez (55 de ani) vor spune „Da” pe 27 iunie, într-o ceremonie care va avea loc pe insula San Giorgio, în faimoasa bazilică San Giorgio Maggiore, o biserică benedictină din secolul al XVI-lea. Lauren Sánchez și Jeff Bezos se căsătoresc la Veneția (Foto: GettyImages) Jeff Bezos și Lauren Sánchez - nuntă de trei zile la Veneția Potrivit tabloidului britanic Daily Mail, evenimentul face parte dintr-un program de trei zile de sărbătoare care va include și o gală pe 26 iunie, posibil în Chiostro della Madonna dell'Orto, și o petrecere grandioasă pe 28 iunie într-un palat sau într-o altă locație spectaculoasă din Veneția. Jeff Bezos, fondatorul Amazon și unul dintre cei mai bogați oameni din lume, cu o avere estimată la aproximativ 225 de miliarde de dolari, și-a adus deja impresionantul iaht de 500 de milioane de dolari, Koru, în portul insulei San Giorgio. Accesul publicului va fi restricționat complet în timpul ceremoniei. Scuola Grande della Misericordia, unul dintre locurile-cheie ale nunții lui Bezos (Foto: Profimedia) Nume celebre pe lista invitaților Lista de invitați cuprinde mai puțin de 200 de persoane, însă printre cei așteptați se numără vedete de prim rang, precum Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry, Orlando Bloom, Kris Jenner, dar și membri ai familiei Trump. Se estimează că evenimentele fastuoase vor costa între 15 și 20 de milioane de dolari, sumă ce acoperă transportul, cazările de lux, rochia de mireasă, serviciile de catering și numeroasele cadouri opulente oferite invitaților. Deși patiseria locală Rosa Salva va furniza deserturi tradiționale precum tiramisu sau fritelli, tortul de nuntă va fi pregătit de un alt furnizor, al cărui nume nu a fost făcut public. Organizarea întregului eveniment este coordonată de Lauren Sánchez, care a declarat într-un interviu pentru Vogue că Jeff „nu se bagă” în astfel de detalii . „Doamne, nu! Par eu atât de prost?” , a glumit Bezos în acel interviu. Relația lor a început în 2018, deși cei doi se cunoșteau din 2016. Hotel Cipriani va găzdui o parte din invitați (Foto: GettyImages) Bezos a angajat compania de producție a lui Sánchez pentru un proiect la Blue Origin, iar în același an au început o relație, deși erau amândoi căsătoriți la vremea respectivă. Patru ani mai târziu, Bezos a cerut-o în căsătorie la bordul iahtului său, cu un inel cu diamant estimat la 5 milioane de dolari. Deși detaliile despre rochia de mireasă a lui Sánchez rămân confidențiale, aceasta a menționat anterior că preferă designeri precum Oscar de la Renta, Christian Dior, Dolce & Gabbana și Valentino."

mov_A320552C1AEDD6D1547BE414C9966CB3,2025-06-23 12:33:27,en,WEB,"  The fashion industry often walks a tightrope with regards to IP: on one side lies the promise of global recognition for fashion-forward designs and on the other, the lurking threat of imitation. In fashion, originality is everything. But creativity without protection, is an open door to imitation. So how do couturiers keep ahead of the copycats? RELATED: MetaBirkins NFTs – the Bold Infringement on Hermès' Iconic Birkin Trade Mark The Importance of Branding It is well understood in fashion, that branding transforms a product from a mere item of clothing into a symbol of identity, status, and aspiration. A well-established trade mark carries with it a promise that resonates emotionally with consumers. Buyers don't pay for an article per se – the quality of the fabric or the stitching – they invest in what the brand represents. This perceived value creates brand loyalty, even at a price premium and despite the fact that competing products offer similar quality, function or form. They say that, in fashion, the label often is the luxury. The most valuable trade marks in fashion (rumoured tao be Louis Vuitton, Nike, Chanel and Hermes – to name but a few) have evolved into fashion power brands by ensuring that there is consistent quality, effective marketing, brand positioning, wide distribution footprint, and performance innovation. The Intersection of Creativity and Innovation Although fashion is mostly regarded as a purely aesthetic pursuit, in reality, it can be deeply technical and innovative. Designers are engineers of wearability and structure. This synergy is beautifully embodied in the designs of Salvatore Ferragamo: he rose to fame for the styling of luxury footwear, but he was also a prolific inventor, holding over 350 patents for everything from wedge heels to child-safe soles. His legacy illustrates an important point: fashion is fertile ground for inventions and innovative designs. Haute couture houses like Gucci, Chanel, and Dior understand this well. Gucci alone has registered hundreds of designs and inventions for handbags, watches, belts, and more. These registrations can be enforced, at least for a limited time, to keep copycats at bay and could form the backbone of licensing and other commercial transactions. Fashion in the Virtual Age While intellectual property (IP) rights have long been used to gain a competitive advantage in the fashion arena, more recently these rights are being tested in unprecedented digital contexts. In a first case of its kind, Hermès took on NFT artist Mason Rothschild over his “MetaBirkins” collection – digital caricatures of the famous Birkin handbag rendered in faux fur and sold as NFTs. Rothschild argued that the project was art, shielded by free speech. Hermès contended that it was trade mark infringement. Ultimately, the court agreed with Hermès. A jury found Rothschild had intentionally misled consumers into thinking the 'digital bags' were affiliated with the luxury brand. He was held liable for trade mark infringement, dilution, and cybersquatting​. This case sent shockwaves through both the fashion and tech industries, illustrating in no uncertain terms, that real-world trade marks extend into the virtual world. Trade marks can be protected from unauthorised use, not only in boutiques or on billboards, but also on blockchain and digital art platforms. The Counterfeit Crisis in the e-Marketplace While the metaverse presents new challenges, old ones persist in full force, especially with the rise of online commerce and side-hustle culture. Platforms like eBay, Amazon, Instagram, and TikTok have made it easy for anyone to launch a fashion storefront. But that accessibility has also supercharged the global trade in counterfeit goods. There can be no doubt that luxury knock-offs are big business. Counterfeits ride the coattails of brand reputation and consumer loyalty without bearing any of the costs of quality or innovation. As consumers chase luxury looks at discount prices, counterfeiters fill the gap by mimicking well-known labels at a fraction of the cost​. Some online marketplaces, like eBay for example, have taken a clear and unequivocal stance on counterfeiting: “We don't allow counterfeit items or unauthorized copies to be listed on eBay. Items sold using a brand name or a brand logo must be original and made by the brand or manufactured on their behalf. Software, music, movies and other media must be original and not unauthorized copies.” Amazon now offers a brand registry for vendors to enrol their brands, together with relevant trade mark information. The registry has several benefits for both brand holders and consumers alike. Brand owners are empowered to police for infringement of their trade marks using proprietary text and image searches on the platform. Amazon also uses advanced machine learning to implement “predictive protections” and then to block potentially infringing products from listing. Swift action against counterfeits enhances the credibility of the Amazon marketplace, which gives consumers the confidence to buy products without any nagging doubts as to their authenticity. The Fashion IP Frontier As fashion continues to evolve alongside innovation, the importance of intellectual property in protecting creativity will only deepen. Whether enforcing a monopoly in a technical innovation – wrinkle-resistant fabrics or wearable tech garments, for example – or protecting trade marks from infringement in the metaverse, the industry is learning to speak (a modern version of) the language of IP. Nowadays, fashion houses don't need to tolerate digital freeloaders and the battle against counterfeits and fakes on e-commerce platforms is only just getting started."

Dior palette is limited edition (and it's my favorite luxury makeup brand) ND palettes were my very first eyeshadow order ever. Cosmic Brushes are my first indie palettes. I think Nudetrals is the most versatile and it's perfect for everyday looks. At first, I was a little skeptical about Beauty Bay eyeshadow, but when I saw the Daydreamer color story, it immediately reminded me of angelic or Douyin makeup. So I had to give it a shot. It turned out to be a lovely, soft, kinda pastel eyeshadow palette. But if you have a medium or deep skin tone, there aren't really any shades in the palette to add depth"

He'll go out later and knock someone out on the dance floor – all while you are at home with the kids. This might sound like most people's idea of a relationship from hell, but this is the reality for Dee Devlin, the woman who stands by Conor McGregor – who insiders insist won't ever leave him…no matter how tough things get. Instagram / @deedevlin1Dee Devlin has stood by Conor McGregor's side no matter what[/caption] Dee and Conor in a clinch on their holiday yacht in the Med after his antics onshore.BackGrid Instagram / Conor McGregorConor has been living it up with Katie Price in Ibiza two days earlier. [/caption] The SunA few hours after that he was punching a reveller in a packed nightclub. [/caption] Mum-of-four Dee, 37, an aspiring businesswoman, has made the ultimate sacrifice – waving goodbye to a sparkling Coleen Rooney-style career – to be the wife and mother of Conor's dreams. Known for standing by her man through thick and thin, Dee has been dubbed the 'brains behind his brand'. An insider told The Sun: “Dee is incredibly loyal and Conor knows that. “She is often there with him behind the scenes, but just not in the limelight. He has also made it very clear he is bankrolling her now, which plays a huge part in the dynamic of their relationship – and makes it almost impossible for her to leave.” They added: “She quietly accepts his behaviour and because she's been there from the beginning, she's always willing to move on. “She'll stick with him, even if he pushes her loyalty in return.” In the early days, she was tipped to be the next Coleen – able to command generous sponsorship and high-profile endorsements as the most high-profile WAG of the global mixed martial arts fighting world. But a string of scandals involving Conor, who uses the stage name The Notorious – has scuppered her wholesome and highly lucrative girl-next-door image. Her chances have been sullied completely by Conor's antics. A source explained: “Dee was set to become a huge personality in her own right – with earning clout to rival the likes of famous WAGs Victoria Beckham or Coleen Rooney. “Dee is popular with the public – you only have to look at her social media following to see that. “She has a wholesome girl-next-door image enhanced as a mum of four and there's huge interest in the fashion brands she is wearing and her lifestyle – but her chances of a clean- cut image that attracts the big money brands have been sullied completely by Conor's antics. “Everyone loves a rag to riches story and Dee and Conor's had huge appeal – until it got sinister. Big brands want to distance themselves from any kind of scandal – especially those involving violence and sexual assault.” While Conor has been hitting headlines for all the wrong reasons, Dee has been behind the scenes helping turn him into a global star. Helping coordinate his finances, sponsorship deals, and travel arrangements, Dee has been instrumental in helping Conor navigate money spinning ventures outside the ring. His fights broke pay-for-view records outside MMA when 5.3m fans paid to watch him fight 10 rounds with Floyd Mayweather in 2017. He also launched a brand of whiskey – Proper No.12 – rumoured to have sold for hundreds of millions, which again Dee played a part in. Instagram / @deedevlin1Dee – the woman behind Conor McGregor – is always the first to show her support[/caption] Big dreams shattered Dee quit school when she was 16, but she was always ambitious. She attempted a number of business ventures including a line of luxury handbags and watches – but Conor was keen to get her on the books and she became his 'manager' as soon as his fighting career started taking off. Just like Wayne and Coleen – Dee and Conor were young sweethearts. A former model and waitress, Dee grew up in a town nearby to Conor and the pair had mutual pals before a chance meeting in a Dublin nightclub where she was working in 2008. She was just 21. At the time, Conor had just quit his plumbing apprenticeship and was at the cusp of his MMA fighting dream.

She has stood by him through highs and lows[/caption] The couple regularly post pictures of their glamorous lifestyleInstagram / @deedevlin1 Neither had any idea what was in store for them – neither the glory nor the court appearances. These days, there is no doubt Dee lives a life to envy. Her wardrobe features Prada, Dior, and Luis Vuitton dresses, while on a visit to a Chanel boutique, £11,000 was spent on two designer handbags. The McGregor family live in a £2.5million home in Kildare, a 40-minute drive from Dublin. They take holidays in Marbella, where they have a £1.3million villa in the exclusive gated The Heights set on the La Resina country club estate. Marriage plans in doubt They got engaged five years ago when Conor popped the question on her 33rd birthday. Questions have been raised as to whether the pair will in fact ever marry. The fighter has spoken about vague marriage plans – insisting it'll happen in Ireland but admitting there is a lot to 'figure out,' and that it is 'a big process,' he added: “Let's see what happens.” The couple met when Dee was 21 Instagram / @deedevlin1Dee and Conor now have a family together[/caption] Two days earlier McGregor was seen cosying up with Katie Price in IbizaInstagram / Conor McGregor They have however, got their very own family, wedding or not. They share four children – Conor, eight, a daughter, Croia, six, and sons Rian, four, and Mack, 19 months. In recent weeks, Dee has been in Spainwith Conor, but she has been nowhere to be seen over the last couple of days  – with sources saying she was clearly looking after the kids while he was out lapping up the lavish offerings Ibiza has to offer. 'Brands have distanced themselves' Topless in a red hat and puffing on a giant cigar, Conor captioned an Instagram shot of him cosying up to Katie Price as '@katieprice Forever'..."

mov_FB7D45A8E76B7F1F9A9ADB668EA855CC,2025-06-23 18:26:26,en,WEB,"  India's biggest fashion event, Lakme Fashion Week, celebrated its milestone 25th anniversary. For years, it has been the space where Indian designers, both veterans and newcomers, shake things up, create and innovate. After a long journey from Los Angeles to Mumbai, I flopped on the couch in the Dolphin Suite of the heritage wing of the Taj Mahal Palace Hotel, gasping at the regal view of the densely crowded Gateway of India amidst the breathtaking backdrop of the Arabian Sea. “I'm at your service for the week, Madam,” my butler Raj's meek voice could faintly be heard against the jarring cacophony of honking horns, street performers, and the chatter of street vendors and passersby. Right at this very moment, I knew I was finally home. There is nothing quite like Indian hospitality. And there is definitely nothing else that quite compares to the soul of Mumbai. I woke up to an unusual feeling of excitement. The fashion landscape in India had come a long way and I was here to take it all in. A few years ago, none of my Western Couture aficionado friends had ever heard of Sabyasachi, Gaurav Gupta or Rahul Mishra. Indian fashion designers were nowhere to be found on the international scene. But these days, those very names are on the tip of the tongues of fashion buyers and collectors in Paris, New York and even L.A. — where celebrities are donning their designs at Hollywood events. Mishra, a Delhi-based designer, made his first foray into global fashion when he showcased his collection at Paris Couture Week in 2020 — a first not only for him, but also for any fashion designer from India. Once a little-known designer from Kolkata, India, who showcased his first collection in 2002 at Lakme Fashion Week in Mumbai, Sabyasachi is one of the most recognizable Indian luxury brands with a flagship store in New York and Western fashionistas hankering after his fusion designs and high jewelry. More in Style My first stop was Amit Aggarwal; the collection, in collaboration with Nothing, brought futurism to fashion. Known for his signature sculptured silhouettes, Aggarwal played with shapes and textures, incorporating unexpected drapes, cropped jackets, and asymmetric hemlines. What Aggarwal does best is to blend traditional Indian craftsmanship with modern designs, and this collection was no different — with his modern reinterpretations of vintage Banarasi textiles. At Falguni Shane Peacock, Falguni and Shane Peacock have shown their collections on major runways such as London and New York. They've dressed everyone from Kim Kardashian to Lady Gaga and outfitted costumes for nearly 30 music videos, including for Beyoncé. The red carpets at Cannes or the Met Gala are no strangers to their talent. I was eager to see their Ready to Wear collection for the Indian market. Their show in Mumbai didn't disappoint. From power-shoulder minis to figure-hugging bodysuits, it was all about making a glamorous statement. The crowd went into a tizzy when Bollywood veteran Karan Johar wrapped up the show in a dapper black ensemble. Rahul Mishra's Spring 2025 Couture show in Paris was the talk of the town, so I was excited to catch his show in Mumbai, showcasing his AFEW line at the finale of Lakmé Fashion Week. As expected from Mishra, the collection was all about exceptional craftsmanship and creativity, featuring gorgeous textures, intricate detailing and rich hues that screamed maximalism. Bandhani, for instance, is a traditional Indian tie-dye print from Gujarat. Pairing it with a contemporary silhouette was another example of Mishra's ability to blend textile traditions and modern trends effortlessly. Mumbai's iconic Gateway of India saw British fashion house Vivienne Westwood host its first-ever show in the country. The venue was the backdrop for Dior's pre-Fall showcase in 2023 and expectations for Westwood's show were high. The focus for Vivienne Westwood was Indian craftsmanship; in this case, a collaboration with artisans and weavers in Madhya Pradesh, India, to source the Chanderi silk for this special capsule collection. It was exciting to see Westwood come up with modern interpretations of the Chanderi fabric, especially for her signature corset gowns. However, some felt that the show left them wanting more and perhaps didn't quite stay true to the designer's rebellious spirit. All eyes were on the Ambanis' daughter-in-law, Radhika, in her archival corset from Westwood's Fall 1990 portrait collection, aptly paired with a traditional Chanderi saree. Mumbai, the Maximum City, was lost but happily found again. I came, I saw and I am reluctantly leaving again. But this experience has rekindled my admiration for your dynamic spirit and creativity. As the likes of Mishra, Sabyasachi and Gupta continue to conquer the international fashion stage, it's time for India's talented designers to finally be recognized as international artists instead of being relegated to bridal and ethnic wear. Watch out, Indian fashion is set to take the world by storm. Namaste from my British Airways flight back to Los Angeles."

The inspiration was taken from Christian Dior's childhood home on the Normandy cliffs in France and a mosaic compass rose known as the “Rose des vents” found in his garden. “To create is to seek, to turn in circles, and then to find one's cardinal reference point and set off on a journey,” says de Castellane. “Creation is the imprint of an immobile journey.” 309 North Rodeo Dr., Beverly Hills, 310-859-4700; dior.com .

f5010d9e602663f932a6d20d265c59cb,2025-06-23 21:34:00,en,WEB,"  WORLD Italian painter proves age just number in art world An Italian painter, now 94, continues inspiring the art world with her unwavering commitment to creativity. Defying the limitations often associated with age, Italian painter Isabella Ducrot maintains a daily routine of painting delicate, expressive works that have earned her international acclaim—despite only seriously beginning her artistic journey in her fifties, Caliber.Az reports via Artsy. Her unique process, poetic themes, and recent exhibitions highlight a lifetime of resilience, discovery, and a profound connection to the beauty of the world around her. Ducrot continues defying expectations with her unwavering dedication to painting. Every day, she walks from her Rome apartment in the Palazzo Doria Pamphilj to a serene studio behind a colonnaded courtyard, where she spends her afternoons painting on Japanese paper using a brush tied to a stick. Often closing her eyes to let her hand flow freely, Ducrot describes the resulting work as a “tender image.” “I almost close my eyes, and let the hand go,” she said. “The result that comes out is a representation of that particular experience: 'tenderness.'” Ducrot is a beloved figure in the art world as a late bloomer—she began pursuing art seriously in her fifties and has recently gained international recognition. Her luminous, poetic paintings often feature flowers, grids, and intertwined figures, enhanced by stitched old textiles and fragments of handwriting. In 2024, her work was featured in solo exhibitions at the Consortium Museum in Dijon and galleries in London and New York, and even appeared alongside Dior's spring/summer fashion collection. Her latest exhibition, “Visited Lands,” at Petzel Gallery in Chelsea, showcases eight large-scale paintings of ethereal landscapes made with pigment ground from meteorites on Gampi paper, which she calls symbolic for its delicate yet strong nature. “Let's hope that our bella terra ['beautiful land'] should have similar qualities to the marvelous Gampi paper,” she said. Ducrot's journey—from wartime Naples to global travels collecting antique textiles, to beginning her artistic career later in life—illustrates a remarkable story of resilience and creative persistence. “Courage has been a kind of trance,” she reflected. “I transformed things, and the things were mostly textiles, and textiles were interesting.” This slow transformation helped her finally admit, “The result was that I had to admit to being an artist.” Through her work, Ducrot invites us to experience the world with fresh eyes, proving that it is never too late to pursue one's passion.

La cité des Doges, paradis des romantiques, reste l'une des destinations préférées des amoureux. Et des futurs mariés ! La preuve, la ville s'apprête à recevoir – non sans vagues – la noce du fondateur d'Amazon Jeff Bezos avec Lauren Sanchez… Des festivités démesurées qui se tiendront entre le 26 et le 28 juin 2025. Mais cette union n'enchante guère les Vénitiens mécontents de voir ainsi ""leur"" ville privatisée, cadenassée, pour un caprice de milliardaires. Les habitants multiplient les actions coup de poing contre le mariage de la troisième fortune mondiale. Le groupe ""No space for Bezos"" a même été lancé. Donnant ainsi le ton… du mécontentement. Quant à savoir si le cours des événements sera perturbé, le suspense reste total. Ce n'est pas la première fois que Venise est le théâtre d'unions spectaculaires, retour sur certaines d'entre elles. Vera Arrivabene et Briano Martinoni Caleppio Le 16 octobre 2021, la comtesse Vera Arrivabene-Valenti-Gonzaga et le comte Briano Martinoni Caleppio se sont mariés en l'église de San Pantalon. Pour l'occasion, le couple avait fait la une de Point de Vue… La comtesse avait choisi une robe immaculée Prada digne d'un conte de fée et une balade en gondole juste après la cérémonie pour observer le soleil darder ses derniers rayons sur Venise. Le moment s'est alors révélé spectaculaire. Presque onirique. George Clooney et Amal Alamuddin Quand George Clooney s'est uni avec Amal Alamuddin le 27 septembre 2014 dans la cité des Doges, brisant au passage bon nombre de cœurs de fans énamourées, même spectacle digne d'un des meilleurs opus hollywoodien. Pour la cérémonie, de Anna Wintour, à Matt Damon, Emily Blunt, Cindy Crawford… on ne comptait plus les célébrités qui s'étaient donnés rendez-vous pour célébrer les jeunes mariés ! Et si les photos sur les gondoles étaient nombreuses, la cérémonie et la robe choisie par Amal sont restées plutôt confidentielles – jusqu'à ce que le créateur se fasse connaître : le très chic Oscar de la Renta.  Salma Hayek et François-Henri Pinault  Quelques années auparavant, le 25 avril 2009, Salma Hayek et François-Henri Pinault célébraient leur union dans cette Sérénissime, théâtre de leur coup de foudre trois ans auparavant. Deux mois après leur mariage civil à Paris, ils avaient eux aussi convié tout un parterre de stars pour cet évènement unique : de Jacques Chirac à Penelope Cruz – l'amie de toujours de la mariée – en passant par l'incontournable papesse de la mode Anna Wintour, Stella McCartney ou encore Charlize Theron. Ici encore très peu d'images de la cérémonie mais pour célébrer leur anniversaire de mariage, la toute nouvelle Mme Pinault avait dévoilé quelques clichés inédits sur son compte Instagram. Bastian Schweinsteiger et Ana Ivanovic sortent de l'église Santa Maria della Misericordia, le 13 juillet 2016. © People Picture/Shutters/SIPA Bastian Schweinsteiger et Ana Ivanovic Une cérémonie civile le 12 juillet 2016 à l'Hôtel de ville de Venise suivie presque immédiatement d'une noce religieuse le lendemain en l'église Santa Maria della Misericordia. Voilà ce qu'ont reservé à leur proches, ce couple de sportifs. Bastian Schweinsteiger, footballeur international allemand et Ana Ivanovic, joueuse de tennis professionnelle serbe, ont misé sur la féérie pour se dire ""oui"". Un moment souvent repoussé à cause des différentes compétitions de chacun d'entre eux ! Pour l'occasion, la mariée portait une sublime robe immaculée Suzie Turner Couture… croyant dur comme fer à l'amour éternel. Las, puisqu'après neuf ans d'union, le mariage s'est soldé par un divorce. Anya Taylor-Joy et Malcolm McRae Audace et discrétion. L'actrice britannico-américaine s'est mariée avec le musicien Malcolm McRae dans le secret le 30 septembre 2023. L'héroïne de la série Le Jeu de la dame aime se démarquer et elle l'a prouvé une fois de plus pour ce moment si symbolique. Dans une pièce signée Dior très éloignée de la traditionnelle robe blanche, Anya Taylor a bousculé les codes avec élégance. La tenue beige brodée d'oiseaux, de fleurs et de perles, était parfaite pour elle et pour l'occasion. Avant cette date, le couple avait officialisé leur relation dans une cérémonie encore plus secrète le 1er avril 2022 à la Nouvelle Orléans… Et la jeune mariée portait la même robe !  Lire aussi >> À Venise, la polémique enfle autour du mariage de Jeff Bezos"
mzeso7c,2025-06-23 22:20:43,en,REDDIT,"  True, just thought I'd share. I originally wrote a nice little story about how she saw a similar Dior purse in Portofino, Italy. We had ducked into the Dior story because it was the only air conditioned business in town on a sweltering hot day. She saw a small purse she liked, but I talked her out of spending $2,400 on it. I found this one for her at a good price, and that I had felt good about the purchase (to surprise her), because of the authenticity guarantee, but those original remarks were all removed automatically."

mov_D0BBA8BFF663B694F79EB1B9E1158184,2025-06-23 23:35:00,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Está circulando una estafa en la que roban datos y dinero a cambio de prometer una caja de productos de belleza, aparentando ser de Farmacity. Alertate. Hay una estafa que está circulando sobre una supuesta caja misteriosa de productos de belleza de alta gama aparentando ser de la reconocida cadena Farmacity. A través de las redes sociales, viralizan esta ""ganga imperdible"" de la cual hay que estar alerta ya que muchos cayeron hasta el momento. ¿En qué consiste? Los estafadores se las ingenian cada vez más fácil para lograr su cometido. En este caso por tan sólo $1.700 o $2.000 y completar una simple encuesta ""te llegará de regalo una caja repleta de productos para disfrutar"". Utilizan el logo de la empresa y hasta fotos de tickets (truchos) que hacen que la gente caiga. El link se encuentra oculto y una vez que los interesados ingresan, deben completar una encuesta con todos sus datos y el costo de la sorpresa es únicamente el envío de esta ""caja misteriosa"" (como la llaman los estafadores). Luego, prometen que te llega a tu hogar con productos importados que Farmacity ni siquiera comercializa. La estafa viene dando vueltas hace algunos meses, por lo que es importante viralizar dicha información para que cada vez llegue a más personas y evitar así que continúe la cadena. Foto: TikTok: mkp.jennifer. Cómo evitar caer en la estafa del momento Como punto principal cabe aclarar que Farmacity no vende Nars, no vende Sol de Janeiro, Dior, Channel ni ninguna de las marcas que promete la caja. Farmacity únicamente trabaja con marcas de farmacia, como por ejemplo, L´Oreal, Maybelline, Garnier, o de su línea como Get the Look, Extreme, entre otras. Al momento, ya fueron muchos los estafados, en su mayoría mujeres. ""No llegué a pagar pero lo malo es que se quedaron con mis datos"", ""Caí, se quedaron con mi dinero"" Son estafas muy fáciles en las que uno puede caer por eso es importante viralizar de qué se trata para alertar. No sólo roban dinero a cada uno que utiliza su tarjeta sino que además, a través de la encuesta quitan datos personales, datos bancarios, clonan tarjetas, ingresan a las cuentas. En este caso además, Farmacity es víctima de una suplantación de identidad por parte de los ciberestafadores que simulan ser la empresa para estafarte. Embed - Nany -Blogg mi día a día, perfumes, belleza en Instagram: ""Farmacity Estafa! Ojo con estas cosas chicas! Están viralizando que hay una chica que dice la hecharon de Farmacity y que hay una encuesta oculta que si la completas podes tener una caja misteriosa x $1700/ $2000 ojo es mentira no caigan en estas cosas! #estafa #farmacity #CajaMisteriosa #nany_skincare"" La estafa con el link puede llegar por mail, no sólo a través de Facebook o Instagram, o redes sociales. En caso de posteos de Facebook, los estafadores convencían a las personas a través del siguiente relato, por ejemplo, simulando ser trabajadores de la empresa. Uno de los casos que se viralizó relataba: ""Mi hermana trabaja en Farmacity y después de días de grandes descuentos les quedaron un montón de maquillajes y productos de belleza sin vender, por acuerdos internos están obligados a armar esas ""misterys boxes"" que mandan a cambio de una reseña o encuesta. Si quieren recibir una ingresen al link de los comentarios. Yo ya la pedí y está buenísima, todo original"". Y luego, para hacerlo más creíble ese posteo se llenaba de comentarios de personas que supuestamente compraron y les llegó la caja con todos los productos. Pero Farmacity no es la única víctima, atentos, ya que también sucedió lo mismo con Amazon, Mercado Libre, Milka (prometiendo cajas de chocolates), entre otras marcas con estafadores que operaban del mismo modo.

mov_AF1D1B9E9912EE1F8D90246B68AD3A61,2025-06-24 00:22:21,en,WEB,"  Dior's latest collection, under the direction of its newly appointed creative director, is poised to explore the enduring relevance of Bram Stoker's Dracula, linking the gothic novel to contemporary anxieties surrounding immigration. The upcoming runway show promises a thought-provoking commentary on history and current events, building on a surprising personal connection discovered by the designer. A 2017 interview revealed the genesis of this creative direction. The designer, who recently succeeded Maria Grazia Chiuri, recounted a pivotal moment during his time working in Dublin. The Dublin Revelation While employed at Brown Thomas, the designer experienced a moment of realization while walking past a historic residence. “I remember walking past a red brick house with a plaque on it that read 'Bram Stoker, author of Dracula, lived here,'” he stated in the interview. “I had to do a double take because I never knew that an Irish person wrote Dracula. People tend to think it's American.” This discovery, compounded by the fact that Stoker lived on the same street – Kildare Street – as the designer, sparked a deeper engagement with the novel. It took “a few days to process” the significance of Stoker's Irish heritage, often overshadowed by the story's global impact. Dracula as a Reflection of Victorian Fears The designer's reflection extended beyond personal discovery to a critical interpretation of the novel itself. Dracula, published in 1897, has become one of the most iconic stories of the 20th century, spawning over 200 film adaptations. However, its author's nationality is frequently overlooked. More importantly, the designer noted the novel's potent commentary on the anxieties of its time. “The novel has been interpreted as Stoker's play on late-Victorian fears of immigration—mostly from Eastern Europe at the time—which goes to show how history repeats itself.” This interpretation positions Dracula not merely as a horror story, but as a cultural artifact reflecting societal anxieties. A Runway Commentary on Contemporary Issues This understanding of Dracula transcends mere creative inspiration or aesthetic choice. It represents a deliberate and timely connection to current events. The designer intends to translate this layered interpretation onto the runway, offering a visual and thematic exploration of historical parallels. The preview of the upcoming collection suggests a deeply engaging and intellectually stimulating presentation. The designer's approach promises to elevate Dior's fashion show beyond a display of clothing, transforming it into a powerful statement on the cyclical nature of history and the enduring relevance of immigration as a global issue.

用省下来的电费买新电器
Efficient Way To Pay
很矛盾的一件事：价格便宜的电器，往往能耗大，电费贵；而贵的电器往往能耗小，电费也会便宜很多。 但对于巴西低收入家庭来说，他们一直用着老旧的高能耗电器，而无力承担电器换新成本。 于是DM9 和 Consul 想出了一个巧妙的解决方案——Consul支持低收入家庭购买电器时无需付款。 他们可以通过使用新款电器剩下来的电费，以免息分期付款的方式支付新电器的费用。 这样一来，无需额外支出即可购买新电器。 Media 媒体

mov_DB924CE2BA042A22ECD7BB5E0BB2F2B5,2025-06-24 06:01:29,pt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]A partir desta terça-feira, 24 de junho, espera-se que os mais de 200 convidados, entre Lady Gaga, Oprah Winfrey e Elon Musk, comecem a chegar a Veneza para os vários dias de celebrações. Pode ser o casamento do ano e é sem dúvidas sobre o qual mais se especulou nos últimos meses. Apesar de unir duas figuras bastante públicas; uma lista de centenas de convidados que incluem estrelas de Hollywood, cantores e apresentadores famosos, alguns dos empresários mais ricos do mundo e até políticos; os detalhes do enlace permanecem envoltos em secretismo e mistério. Jeff Bezos, o fundador da Amazon e a quarta pessoa mais rica do mundo pediu a antiga jornalista Lauren Sánchez em casamento em maio de 2023, com um anel com um diamante rosa de mais de 20 quilates avaliado em 2 milhões de euros, e agora o casal prepara-se para finalmente trocar alianças numa celebração de três dias em Veneza. Não é a primeira vez que se casam: Bezos foi casado entre 1993 e 2019 com Mackenzie Scott, com quem teve quatro filhos, enquanto Lauren Sánchez esteve casada entre 2005 e 2021 com Patrick Whitesell, com quem tem dois filhos. A antiga jornalista é ainda mãe de Nikko, fruto de uma relação com o ex jogador de futebol americano Tony Gonzalez. Numa entrevista conjunta à Vogue cinco meses depois do noivado, Bezos foi direto, e garantiu que as decisões sobre o casamento ficariam nas mãos de Sánchez: “Não me vou envolver. Pareço burro?” Na altura, a antiga jornalista afirmou que ainda estava a pensar no tema: “Vai ser grande? No exterior? Ainda não o sabemos”, disse. Até o momento a única certeza é de que o enlace será esta semana em Veneza. O casal tem mantido o silêncio e não confirmou nenhuma informação veiculada na imprensa, mas há muitos palpites sobre onde, quando e quem vai estar no casamento. Eis o que já se sabe. Apesar de todo o secretismo, vários órgãos da imprensa norte-americana e italiana avançam que a cerimónia e as festas devem decorrer esta semana, entre 24 e 28 de junho. De acordo com o New York Times, o casamento não será religioso, pelo que poderá acontecer fora de uma igreja. Primeiro falou-se que os dois trocariam alianças à bordo do Koru, o super iate do empresário avaliado em mais de 500 milhões de euros, entretanto agora há dois espaços onde se especula que poderá decorrer o enlace, avança o Telegraph: a Fondazione Giorgio Cini, na ilha de San Giorgio, que já recebeu encontros do G20 e da UNESCO e oferece a privacidade que os noivos procuram além de um espaço amplo com diversas salas com capacidade para até mil convidados; ou o local mais citado pelos jornais internacionais, a Scuola Grande della Misericordia, construída no século XVI com arquitetura renascentista, dois andares e quase 900 metros quadrados, um espaço que foi remodelado em 2016. Espera-se ainda uma série de festividades à bordo do iate de Bezos e em outros locais da cidade, como o Palazzo Pisani Moretta e o Hotel Excelsior, na ilha de Lido. “Cada momento está planeado, dentro e fora do iate, e os nossos clientes têm reclamado sobre a quantidade de eventos constantes”, afirmou ao The Hollywood Reporter Jaclyn Sienna India, CEO do serviço de viagens de luxo Sienna Charles, e que está a atender alguns dos convidados. “Serão três dias com praticamente nenhum tempo livre. Serão muitos visuais e isso significa que vai ser de arromba, porque poderia ser realizado noutros lugares muito mais privados”, assinala ainda. Manter em segredo os vários dias de festas, em diferentes locais e com centenas de convidados será de facto uma tarefa difícil e exige conhecimento. A organização está a cargo da Lanza & Baucina, uma agência com base em Londres mas criada por três primos italianos e que já tem experiência em eventos desta magnitude, como por exemplo o casamento de George e Amal Clooney em 2014. De acordo com o NYT, a empresa já expressou a intenção de minimizar “qualquer disrupção na cidade” e informa que vai empregar trabalhadores locais. O site oficial da agência é direto sobre o tipo de eventos que organiza: “as festas mais exclusivas, privadas e espetaculares”. A página tem apenas os contactos e uma mensagem, a destacar que “discrição é primordial” e a declarar-se como uma empresa “com experiência em casamentos de membros da realeza a celebridades A-list”. E termina com um aviso: “não temos presença nas redes sociais e nenhum exemplo prévio de trabalho publicado”. No final de março a câmara de Veneza emitiu um comunicado a responder a algumas notícias que diziam que a cidade não seria capaz de receber o casamento e acabou por confirmar o número de pessoas esperado para as comemorações. “Serão cerca de 200 convidados, pelo que será fácil para Veneza acolher este evento sem nenhum constrangimento para a cidade, os seus residentes e os turistas”, escreveu a autarquia. Já mais recentemente à NBC News, os oficiais municipais afirmaram que “as celebrações, que terão 250 convidados, vão estar misturadas no ritmo diário da cidade, que com dignidade e respeito, recebe milhares de visitantes de todo o mundo enquanto garante a qualidade de vida dos residentes, trabalhadores e estudantes”, diz o comunicado. Ainda de acordo com a câmara municipal, cerca de 30 dos 280 táxis aquáticos da cidade estão reservados para transportar convidados pelos canais, e três ou quatro hotéis foram reservados para acolher os que vão participar no evento. De acordo com o Telegraph, os hotéis serão todos luxuosos e de cinco estrelas: o Belmond Cipriani, que fica na ilha de Giudecca e deve receber Lady Gaga (que poderá cantar na boda); o Aman, o Danieli, o Marriot Gritti Palace e o St. Regis, onde devem ficar Ivanka Trump e o marido, Jared Kushner. O jornal avança ainda que Donald Trump poderá fazer uma aparição no casamento, apesar de o NYT garantir que o Presidente norte-americano não vai ao enlace. Outros convidados poderão chegar à bordo de luxuosos iates — que de acordo com o que disse um representante local ao NYT, serão nove. É o caso de Orlando Bloom e a noiva Katy Perry. Entre os convidados famosos também estão nomes como Mick Jagger, Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Oprah Winfrey, Eva Longoria e Leonardo DiCaprio. Também Elon Musk e Mark Zuckerberg, dois dos homens mais ricos do mundo e dos principais empresários do mundo da tecnologia, devem estar presentes. Já o casal Bezos fica à bordo do Koru, o super iate do empresário avaliado em mais de 500 milhões de euros, e que é considerado o maior iate do mundo. A embarcação será apoiada por outro barco gigante, o Abeona, que tem um heliporto, provavelmente para ajudar no transporte de convidados e também dos visuais da noiva. Se o dia, o local e os convidados são um “segredo”, o vestido de noiva está ainda mais envolto em mistério. O Telegraph diz que serão ao todo 27 visuais, entre peças Oscar de la Renta e Dolce & Gabbana. Os palpites poderão estar relacionados com os últimos visuais públicos de Sánchez: na Met Gala de 2024 a noiva de Bezos usou um vestido Oscar de la Renta por recomendação de Anna Wintour, que de acordo com o The Hollywood Reporter, voltou a guiar Lauren Sánchez na escolha do mesmo designer para a boda. Aliás, em março, na festa pós Óscares da Vanity Fair, a ex-jornalista usou um modelo da coleção de noivas da marca de luxo. Entretanto, o próprio autarca de Veneza confirmou que ouviu pela primeira vez sobre o casamento através de Domenico Dolce. O casal também foi visto a experimentar alguns looks na loja de Milão, o que fortalece a teoria de que ambos usarão peças da marca italiana em algum momento ao longo dos dias de festa. Em dezembro de 2023, quando ainda estava noiva há apenas cinco meses, Sánchez nomeou, em entrevista à Vogue, Christian Dior, Dol..."

Seit Wochen brodelt die Gerüchteküche – rund um die Gästeliste, die Sicherheitsmaßnahmen und natürlich das Hochzeitskleid. Es ist DAS Society-Spektakel des Sommers: Wenn Lauren Sánchez und Jeff Bezos sich Ende Juni in Venedig das Jawort geben, wird die ganze Welt zusehen. Ganze Inselbereiche der Lagunenstadt sollen für das Mega-Event gesperrt werden, während Bezos' 127-Meter-Yacht „Koru“ als schwimmende Festkulisse dient. Die Gästeliste bleibt bis zum Schluss geheim – aber von Katy Perry über George Clooney bis hin zu Ivanka Trump wird alles erwartet, was in der Promiwelt Rang und Namen hat. Doch während Venedig sich herausputzt, sind Sánchez, Bezos und ihre Gäste schon fast auffällig still – besonders wenn es um Informationen zum Kleid aller Kleider geht. Doch erste Hinweise deuten darauf hin: Diese Hochzeit wird auch modisch alles andere als zurückhaltend. Der große Couture-Countdown: Wer darf Lauren Sánchez einkleiden? Fest steht: Das finale Hochzeitskleid ist bislang ein streng gehütetes Geheimnis – noch kein Designer hat sich offiziell dazu geäußert, kein einziges Bild ist an die Öffentlichkeit gelangt. Und doch brodelt die Gerüchteküche: Gleich mehrere Haute-Couture-Größen sind im Rennen – mit Oscar de la Renta als klarer Favorit. Denn wie das Magazin „People“ berichtet, soll keine Geringere als Vogue-Chefin Anna Wintour persönlich in die Kleiderwahl der Braut involviert sein. De la Renta zählt nicht nur zu ihren erklärten Lieblingsdesignern – laut Insidern soll sie Lauren Sánchez das Traditionshaus sogar aktiv ans Herz gelegt haben. Auch Sánchez selbst zeigt sich seit Jahren begeistert von dessen Stil. Zur Vanity-Fair-Oscar-Party erschien sie in einem weißen, trägerlosen Federkleid des Labels – ein Auftritt, der schon fast wie eine modische Generalprobe fürs Jawort wirkte. Aber damit nicht genug: Im März wurden Sánchez und Bezos bei einer Anprobe im Mailänder Dolce & Gabbana Flagship-Store gesichtet – samt neugieriger Paparazzi vor der Tür. Ein deutliches Zeichen dafür, dass auch das italienische Duo im Rennen liegt. Besonders dann, wenn Sánchez – wie viele in der Branche vermuten – nicht nur ein Kleid tragen wird, sondern gleich mehrere. Die Luxusmarke ist bekannt dafür, Bräute persönlich nach Mailand einzuladen – so lief es bereits für Kourtney Kardashians Hochzeit und weiteren prominenten Kundinnen. Für eine Hochzeit dieser Größenordnung wären also gleich mehrere exklusive Anproben durchaus denkbar. Brautkleid(er) mit Millionenbudget: Das dürfen wir erwarten Sánchez' Stil ist klar: es wird freizügig, figurbetont und heiß! Ihre Looks sind bis ins kleinste Detail inszeniert. Experten rechnen mit einem Mermaid-Schnitt, luxuriösen Stoffen, strukturierten Korsagen und aufwändigen Applikationen – etwa Spitzen- oder Federdetails, wie sie auf ihren bisherigen Red-Carpet-Looks immer wieder auftauchten. In Interviews nannte sie Christian Dior, Valentino und Dolce & Gabbana als ihre absoluten Lieblingshäuser. Und sie hat mehrfach bewiesen, dass sie sich modisch in dieser Luxus-Liga mehr als wohlfühlt. Doch bei einem einzigen Kleid wird es wohl kaum bleiben. Sánchez, die bereits zu ihrer Bachelorette-Party in einem weißen Kirschblüten-Zweiteiler von Oscar de la Renta erschien, setzt gerne auf aufsehenerregende Auftritte – und das nicht nur einmal. Es gilt als wahrscheinlich, dass sie für die unterschiedlichen Programmpunkte – von der Trauung über den Empfang an Bord der Yacht bis hin zur rauschenden Party – mehrere Couture-Looks einplanen lässt. Preispunkt der Outfits? Vermutlich jenseits der 6-stelligen Dollargrenze. Was (und wie viel) auch immer am Ende gewählt wird – diese Hochzeit wird ein modisches Weltereignis. Venedig steht schon bereit – und wir zählen gespannt die Minuten!"

2ed4d1e9cfa7fd4457195542405d3260,2025-06-24 11:04:00,en,WEB,"  There's a new trend in the dating world... and it's a little bit sinister. In the less salubrious corners of the internet, a growing number of people are embracing 'dark psychology' to get ahead in their personal and professional lives. What is dark psychology? Well, it's not a real science - rather a term some use to describe the human capacity for manipulation and deception. Basically, the diabolical little tricks that help things go your way. Back in the Noughties, men in the 'pick-up artist' movement used to exploit certain dark psychology methods to seduce women - think negging, peacocking, etc. Now, women are joining the trend, but instead of simply trying to get men in bed (which isn't hard!) they are using devilish tactics to 'trick' them into falling in love. There are thousands of videos, forums and threads dedicated to the feminine art of getting Mr Right to ditch every girl on his roster and only have eyes for you. Some of the methods are so clever you can't help but stand back and admire them. But others are so damn manipulative I couldn't help but think, 'Gosh... poor guy.' Women are using dark psychology to 'trick' men into committing to them, writes Jana Hocking So I asked my female followers if they'd hopped on the dark psychology bandwagon, and it turns out a surprising number of you are modern-day witches! Are they ethical? Probably not. Do they work? Apparently, yes. Do I recommend using them? Well, I'll let you decide. The mirror trick This one seems like an obvious flirting tactic, but practitioners of dark psychology swear by it: consistently mirror your man's body language and he will fall for you . Lani* told me she got a man she'd been seeing casually to commit to her after using this trick every time they were together. ' If he sipped his drink, I sipped mine straight away. If he crossed his arms, I did the same. I even started using his favourite phrases, laughing the way he laughed. I ordered similar meals,' she said. ' It felt silly at first. But over time he opened up to me more and more. Before long, he was copying me - something he never used to do. ' He dropped the emotional walls and detached attitude that made me feel insecure when we were together. After a month, he was acting like a boyfriend.' Men are trying to get women into bed, women are trying to make men fall in love Lani said she literally did nothing different apart from mirror his gestures - but there was a complete change in his behaviour. She is now convinced it's all about appealing to a man's innate narcissism. ' He kept saying how comfortable and connected he felt. But really, I was just reflecting him back at himself. Trust a man to fall in love with his own reflection!' she laughed. Why it works: We like people who remind us of ourselves. It feels familiar, safe, intimate. It's a bonding technique used by many psychologists to help their clients open up faster. But the downside of using this technique is that you could lose your own personality in the process. The magic favour Natasha* swears by this one. Men want to feel useful, and they fall in love with women they feel they can help - that is a cornerstone of male psychology that is easily manipulated. ' I asked him to fix a wobbly shelf. He did, and I made him dinner as a thank you,' Natasha explained. ' A week later, I made a passing reference to how I find flat-pack furniture confusing. Lo and behold, the man who would leave me on read suddenly offered to help assemble my new bed frame!' Was a bed frame too complicated for Natasha to get her pretty little head around? No! But playing the damsel in distress all of a sudden had her flaky fling dropping everything to see her. ' After that, he started offering lifts, cooking, helping with errands,' she added. Natasha didn't nag him for favours...."

mov_3630F8237251E40C7FDC8A0A67787637,2025-06-24 12:03:18,en,WEB,"  In the flurry of polka dots, butter yellow frocks, and best-dressed lists that was Royal Ascot this year, it would have been easy to forget to slow down and admire the finer details. But, as every seasoned royal watcher knows, the most revealing clues are often in the jewellery. Over the course of the five-day racing spectacular, Queen Camilla dazzled with an enviable parade of historic brooches, each with a glittering pedigree. Known for her fondness for a jewelled pin (especially those from the Royal Collection), the Queen's brooches offered much stately sentiment. Day One: A diamond fit for a Queen Kicking off proceedings by the King's side in the Royal Procession, Queen Camilla wore a mint green Dior coat dress paired with a feathered Philip Treacy hat. Her jewellery perfectly complemented: pearls and the Cullinan V diamond brooch. Heart-shaped and cut from the legendary 3,106-carat Cullinan diamond, the largest ever discovered, the brooch's central 18.8-carat heart-shaped stone has a regal history. It is one of nine major stones from the Cullinan, others of which adorn the Sovereign's Sceptre and the Imperial State Crown. A favourite of the late Queen Elizabeth II, the Cullinan V brooch was worn for Prince Philip's 99th birthday portrait and made another cameo when Her Late Majesty sat front row next to Anna Wintour at Richard Quinn's London Fashion Week show in 2018. Day Two: Going green with the Cambridge Emerald Her Majesty chose a deep green crepe silk gown by Anna Valentine and yet another Treacy hat for day two. Her brooch? The Cambridge Emerald Cluster Brooch, so dazzling it had to have inspired the emerald ensemble. This was Camilla's first public outing in the piece, though the brooch itself has been in royal hands for over two centuries. Believed to have originally belonged to Queen Mary (the magpie of the monarchy), it was passed down to Queen Elizabeth II in 1953. Featuring a central round emerald encircled by two halos of diamonds, the brooch can be worn with or without its suspended cabochon-cut emerald drop. The late Queen favoured the smaller setting for daytime events, reserving the full effect for special occasions. Day Three: Return of the star In a shade of powder blue, again by Anna Valentine, and another millinery by Philip Treacy, the Queen reprised her use of the Jardine Star brooch, a piece as sparkling as it is mysterious. Inherited from Queen Elizabeth II, the brooch was worn by Her Late Majesty for her Diamond Jubilee in 2012 and in her Christmas broadcast five years later, amongst many Royal outings. Yet little is known about its provenance. According to royal jewellery historian Leslie Field, it was bequeathed to the Queen by Lady Jardine in 1981. She weathered fourteen years as a political WAG, but now Sarah Vine is ready to tell her side of the story – Tatler scoops a wide-ranging interview and is invited into the inner sanctum The true identity of Lady Jardine remains elusive. ' There's a Clan Jardine in Scotland,' muses 'but none of the baronets' wives died in 1981.' The brooch's origin remains a brilliant enigma. Day Four: Fruit revival By Friday, the Queen was back in white with her trusted favourites and a Dior tote that turned heads, not least because the bag was renamed in 1996 in honour of Princess Diana. Adding a touch of colour to the monochrome ensemble was the Raspberry Pip brooch. So named because of its resemblance to the tiny structure of a raspberry seed, this ruby-toned piece was originally gifted in 1881 to Cecilia Nina Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne, Camilla's great-grandmother-in-law by marriage. The brooch passed through the Queen Mother's collection to Queen Elizabeth II, before Camilla made her own debut wearing it on Christmas Day 2023. Day Five: Diamonds are a Queen's best friend For the grand finale, while King Charles donned a lemon yellow waistcoat, Queen Camilla went monochrome once more, but who needs colour when you're boasting a new brooch from the royal vault. The Rothschild Diamond Watch Brooch has not been seen on a royal figure in nearly a century. Originally a wedding gift to the future Queen Mary in 1893 from Alice de Rothschild, it was last photographed on Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, then Duchess of York, in 1936. This marks its first public reappearance in nearly 90 years, an astonishing comeback for such an heirloom.

In February, Burberry's creative director Daniel Lee cast the 61-year-old actor for his first modelling gig. Much like his recent role in The White Lotus Now, he's receiving guest invites instead of show day call sheets, having tail-ended a family trip to Tuscany with the Giorgio Armani show in Milan. ""I say I'm on holiday, but I'm basically chauffeuring my children and their boys, friends, girlfriends around to different towns and restaurants, "" he says to me over video call, before he slips into a GA linen suit to sit front row. ""So I left my chauffeuring duties for a day to come here."" It's fair to say that Isaacs is having a moment. He's had plenty of them before – thanks to iconic roles in The Harry Potter franchise, Netflix's The OA and much more besides – but he was caught up in the zeitgeist this year with his depiction of Timothy Ratcliff, the big-shot patriarch who leans on Lorazepam during his fraught stay at The White Lotus's Thai outpost. Then came The Salt Path, an independent film that adapted Raynor Winn's book of the same name, telling the story of a couple who take a 630-mile trek along the Cornish coast. It grossed £1.4 million upon its opening weekend, and has outperformed Mission: Impossible – The Final Reckoning ""It's been a very heartening reminder that when you tell great stories, it doesn't matter whether you have stunts or giant budgets, ""says Isaacs. ""In the end, we must hold human stories. With his fashion expertise growing, Esquire asked Isaacs about his sense of style, holiday dressing, and what it was like to walk the runway with Naomi Campbell. This interview has been edited for length and clarity As you've come from a holiday, what are some essentials that you always pack? I'm a tennis player, so I pack a tennis racket, and I pack things that I can play tennis in like tennis shoes and shorts, tops. Hopefully that will not hang heavily on me. Always pack two pairs of swimming trunks, because one will be wet and you might want to wear the other one. But it doesn't really matter, because my girls steal everything. My daughters steal my underwear and T shirts, and all of those baggy clothes. That's the sign of a fashionable wardrobe I do [have that] now, funnily enough. Since The White Lotus, I've been gifted so many things. I had a relatively empty wardrobe before, and now I have a wardrobe packed full of these fabulous suits and clothes. And my wife loves the transformation and begs me to keep dressing like this. But when we lived in California, she rightly identified that I liked living there because I wanted to dress like a skateboarder until I died. I was a professional skateboarder when I was 14 and 15, and I've never quite grown out of that. So this is the new incarnation for me. I don't know if it'll stick. I now have a bunch of lovely suits I feel very uncomfortable wearing them. I'm aware that one looks better wearing them, but my ideal clothes are Covid clothes: sweatpants and an old t-shirt. What's a film you think is really stylish? A film that comes to mind is Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris, because it was all about Dior and fashion. But I'm in that so it's likely too vain, possibly. I love The Godfather, that era of clothes and those extraordinary suits. They conjure up a sense of manhood and asylum people want. Even the casual clothes when Michael goes to Sicily, and those baggy suits! There's something about the men of that era, the hats and the mob clothes and how they embraced clothes that they couldn't wear during the war, the shapes of them that haven't really come back in, despite [fashion] being cyclical. I can't think of a time when men have looked like they looked in the forties. Are costumes vital in helping you to get into character? No more me than all actors. I mean, that's one of the tools you have to tell the audience in some visual shorthand about where you come from. One of the reasons I'm here [attending the Giorgio Armani show] is that I was in The White Lotus, I'm sure. You knew so much about those characters by what they wore. Alex [Bovaird] did the costumes and they told the audience so clearly and so specifically what world these characters came from. She does it so brilliantly that she's continually getting Emmy nominations for it. You almost didn't need to get to know where they're from, you could tell what they were like from what they were wearing on the boat [in the first episode]. You make assumptions that's then subverted by Mike White's brilliant writing...."

This trend is characterized by luxury goods and services that are accessible to a wider audience without compromising on quality or prestige. Indian consumers are seeking premium products that reflect their lifestyle, status, and personal taste, with a growing demand for unique, limited, and sought-after collections. The masstige market in India is expected to continue growing, with a projected growth rate of 10% over the next five years, exceeding $200 billion by 2030. Brands like Good Earth, Nicobar, and Nappa Dori are popular choices among Indian consumers seeking premium and sustainable products. As consumers become more discerning and demanding, luxury brands will need to adapt to changing preferences and priorities, including sustainability and exclusivity. Keywords Masstige, Indian luxury market, digital consumers, sustainability, craftsmanship, personalization, aspirational demographic, global luxury slowdown, artisanal ecosystem, Made in India Introduction The global luxury goods market, valued at $286.10 billion in 2024 and expected to reach $405.80 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 3.76%, is experiencing a slowdown in certain segments. However, India's luxury market is poised for growth, driven by a young and aspirational demographic, rising affluence, and increasing demand for premium products. Despite the global slowdown, India's luxury market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 10% over the next five years, exceeding $200 billion by 2030. This growth is driven by the rising affluence. India's growing middle class, with increasing disposable income, is driving demand for luxury goods and experiences. The Young and Aspirational Demographic with over 65% of its population under 35, India boasts a young and dynamic consumer base, prioritizing experiences, personalization, and exclusivity. Evolving Luxury: India's Cultural Edge and Masstige Opportunity Global Luxury Market Trends is mainly dominated by Asia Pacific region holding a revenue share of 39.9% in 2024, driven by increasing disposable incomes and a growing middle class. The Apparel accounting for 25.9% of global revenue in 2024, driven by product innovation, exclusivity, and evolving fashion trends. The most valuable luxury brands in 2024 include Porsche, valued at $43.117 billion, followed closely by Louis Vuitton at $32.235 billion, and Chanel at $26.068 billion. Hermès and Gucci also rank high, with valuations of $16.676 billion and $14.864 billion, respectively. These iconic brands have established themselves as leaders in the luxury market, known for their exceptional quality, craftsmanship, and timeless appeal. While the Indian luxury market holds immense potential, it also poses challenges. Luxury brands need to balance pricing strategies to cater to India's price-conscious consumers. The strict regulations require local partnerships, which can deter foreign luxury brands from entering the Indian market. By understanding the unique challenges and opportunities, luxury brands can capitalize on India's growth story and establish a strong foothold in this dynamic market. India's luxury market is a mindset that needs to be understood rather than a market that needs to be “entered.” The challenge for international luxury brands is not only to navigate strict FDI regulations and skyrocketing import taxes, but also to rethink what luxury means in India and reevaluate their initial expectations of what it should look like. The demand is genuine, but it is encased in paradox: a buyer who worships tradition but consumes hypermodern, who purchases luxury but looks for purpose, and who drives a Mercedes but haggles over MRP. Where and how luxury is consumed in India is where the real change is occurring. Delhi and Mumbai's influence as centres of luxury is eroding. The next generation of luxury customers isn't just exploring Emporio's marble floors; they're also perusing Instagram in places like Indore, Coimbatore, and Guwahati, yearning for experiences that align with their values and goals. The Western luxury playbook doesn't work here. Retail reimagining is required, not just expansion, with flagship stores serving as both physical locations and digital ecosystems that are rich in regional aesthetics, local language, and cultural codes. Although regulatory constraints, high taxes, and disorganized infrastructure may appear to be obstacles, they can also be reframed as an appeal to reorganize the luxury value chain, beginning with manufacturing in India. International brands have a strong chance to base their production within India's centuries-old artisanal ecosystems rather than paying a premium to import finished goods. and pricing for belonging, as well as affordability. Costs can be cut by sourcing and producing in India, but more significantly, it provides authenticity, which is something that customers around the world are beginning to value more. India offers unrivalled material culture and skilled human capital, from the leather craftsmen of Dharavi to the brocade weavers of Varanasi, from the intricate hand embroidery of Lucknow to the metal artisans of Moradabad, often at a fraction of the cost, but with unmatched finesse. Imagine the possibilities if global brands considered India as a co-creative partner as well as a sourcing destination: a Dior lehenga woven in Banaras, a Gucci bag featuring illustrations by Pattachitra, or a Hermès scarf block-printed in Bagru, each piece carrying not only aesthetic but also emotional and geographical depth. However, authenticity, sustainability, and innovation are more important than cost-effectiveness. “Made in India” can be a mark of soul and storytelling in a time when aware consumers want to know where, how, and by whom their products are made. In addition to improving their ethical reputation, brands that emphasize these origins use cultural intelligence to capitalize on the rising demand for luxury around the world. Additionally, this creates a huge masstige opportunity: luxury brands can reach India's aspirational yet budget-conscious consumer base by co-creating mid-tier, culturally rich, and design-forward collections produced in India. This market is looking for identity, craftsmanship, and meaning rather than logos. Brands can grow without compromising their values by investing in Indian craftsmanship and providing affordable luxury lines with strong local appeal. In the end, the Indian luxury market requires brands to become deeply rooted in the Indian culture rather than just localizing. The key to success will be creating a luxury that feels personal, welcoming, and distinctly Indian rather than trying to emulate Parisian extravagance...."

And it was a very understandable crime. They BEGAN their open and brave warfare against a GOD of cosmic evil by fucking saving the Havens from his mega-army (1st Battle) while Thingol fled and hid in his caves. The thank you they get at the end of the cycle is that the Haven rabble withholds a silmaril. The feanorians finally snapped. The real story of the Silmarillion is just how much betrayal they have to take from their fellow belerians elves. EVEN THEN some feanorians did not have the heart to kill their fellow elves. It speaks volumes of the goodness of their hearts. >but Maedhros and Maglor won the day, though they alone remained thereafter of the sons of Feanor, for both Amrod and Amras were slain.” Maybe that loser bloodline of Thingol, Beren, Luthien, dior, Elwing should have fucked off and found their own heirloom for their dynasty? Rather than steal the 1 fucking thing another, braver and more noble, royal house had sworn to retrieve. Ever asked yourself why they didnt do that?"

""When he opened the box, I think I blacked out a bit,"" she told the outlet. Who is on the guest list? Given the secrecy around the nuptials, it comes as no surprise that the guest list has also been kept tightly under wraps. However, several media outlets including the New York Times and People have reported the star-studded guest list will include the likes of Katy Perry and Gayle King, who traveled to space with Sánchez on a Blue Origin flight in April, Oprah Winfrey, Mick Jagger, Salma Hayek, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.

Guests who were part of the couple's two engagement parties could also be in attendance. While the first party took place on Bezos' yacht on the Amalfi Coast in Italy in August 2023, the second one took place at designer Diane von Furstenberg and businessman Barry Diller's home in Beverly Hills, USA TODAY previously reported. Those in attendance at the California celebration included Winfrey, Hayek, Jenner, actors Barbra Streisand and Robert Pattinson, recording artist Jewel, models Suki Waterhouse and Miranda Kerr, and designer Sarah Staudinger. Which designer will Lauren Sánchez wear to her wedding? Sánchez has not revealed which designer she will be wearing to her wedding. The former TV anchor said in a November 2024 interview with TODAY she's ""thinking about the dress."" ""I have to say, I do have a Pinterest − I'm just like every other bride, so I do have a Pinterest board,"" Sánchez previously said. Earlier, in an interview with Vogue, the future Mrs. Bezos named Christian Dior, Dolce & Gabbana, and Valentino as her favorites. Italy protests As the nuptials draw closer, locals in Venice are protesting against the wedding and seeing the celebrations as a sign of garish commodification of a fragile city, that has long been overrun with tourism while steadily depopulating, Reuters reported. However, city authorities are defending the grand wedding, estimated to cost $23-$34 million according to regional governor Luca Zaia, who added it is expected to bring an economic boost to local businesses. Activists from Greenpeace Italy and UK group ""Everyone hates Elon"" (Musk) unfolded a giant banner in central St Mark's Square June 23 with a picture of Bezos laughing and a sign reading: ""If you can rent Venice for your wedding, you can pay more tax."" Locals have also threatened peaceful blockades against the event on the day of, saying Venice needed public services and housing, not VIPs and over-tourism.

sJ-o0W2cF8Y,2025-06-24 17:01:06,en,YOUTUBE,"  Lauren Abedini, widely known by her artist moniker KITTENS, has established herself as dynamic force within the music, fashion, and beauty industries over the past decade. Her multifaceted profile as a DJ, music producer, host, content creator, creative strategist, and intersectional advocate, positions her as a standout figure with a profound impact and understanding across various creative domains. Growing up on the outskirts of Los Angeles, Lauren ventured into the local nightlife and music scene at an early age, stoking her creative flame. With her vast knowledge and relentless curiosity for music, KITTENS established herself as a tastemaker and trail blazer for women in dance music. Her infectious DJ sets garnered support from some of the most influential artists of our time, including Usher, Kid Cudi, Skrillex and A-Trak while earning opportunities to DJ the most coveted stages, from iconic global festivals including Coachella and EDC, to residencies in Las Vegas. As an Iranian- American, queer, woman, KITTENS is unapologetic about her intersectional identity. She has used this fearlessness to inspire other women through her podcast SHE/HER/THEY and charity driven DJ workshops, PWR. Through SHE/HER/THEY, Lauren has crafted a unique space where listeners andtop notch guests,such as iconic musicians Demi Lovato & Kehlani, and esteemed actors Sarah Shahi & Alexandra Shipp, are nurtured to embark on a journey of unfiltered authenticity exploration. Candid dialogue around themes of identity, gender, sexuality, career, and creativity take center stage, empowering listeners to free themselves from societal expectations in pursuit of genuine happiness. While PWR offers women and gender expansive folks a place to explore new creative endeavors in a safe and encouraging space. Through both of these projects, KITTENS is able to empower those who have gone through life without feeling seen to explore identity and life without boundaries. Lauren's prowess in crafting thoughtful social, creative, and music strategies has led to impactful collaborations with globally renowned brands, including YSL Beauté, Adidas, Tiffany & Co., Amazon Music, Moncler, Dior, Coach, HBO, and more. Whether commanding main stages at Coachella, orchestrating insightful conversations with A-List talent on her podcast, or championing educational initiatives for marginalized communities, Lauren keeps inclusivity and cultural impact as her guiding light."

mov_A7E276E0B170CBCCEA334CE203369D9B,2025-06-24 17:37:00,en,WEB,"  Glastonbury Festival, aka the holy grail of fashion and music. A place where, according to Glasto style icon Alexa Chung, no matter how “terrible” your outfit choice is, “it still looks great.” And so, for the lucky ones who managed to bag a ticket to the UK's grittier version of Coachella, you're likely now in full wardrobe planning mode. Perhaps you're looking back to previous Glastonburys for some inspiration, especially from your favourite celebs. Whether you're throwing it right back to 2007 Kate Moss, or looks from recent years are more your vibe (Maya Jama's 2024 Dior 'Plan de Paris' outfit was a standout), behold some of the best celebrity fits alongside their highstreet alternatives. Best dress How can we not start with Alexa? She's a festival fashion veteran, after all. In terms of this dress, it ticks all the boxes: stylish, comfortable, and goes with everything. At Glasto, you want something you can just throw on but still look like you've made an effort. Basically, you can never go wrong with a slip dress, rain or shine. Best Glastonbury Dresses Topshop Lace Insert Midi Dress with Pleated Bust ZESICA Halter Neck Ruffle Tiered Layered Chiffon Dress Best shoes Remember, you're going to be walking for miles, so you need something that blends comfort and fashion. This year, it looks like it's going to be good weather, so you may not need those rain boots. (Pack them just in case, obvs.) Instead, opt for a pair of statement black boots like Dua Lipa. They're so versatile because they look great with different styles, from cute white lace prairie mini-dresses to frayed denim shorts. Best two-piece We *love* a two-piece. They're also really handy for festivals, as you don't have to think about how you'll make the rest of the outfit pop. The co-ord does all the talking! Be sure to pair the skirt/skort/shorts with a plain top underneath, like Maya did last year. This way, you've still got a fire outfit if you remove the jacket. Best Glastonbury Two-Piece Topshop Tailored Pleated Wide Leg Pant Set Beffanie Halter Wrap Set Polka Dot Curve Best bag Getting the right bag for Glasto can be tricky. It can't be too big, but it can't be too small. It also needs to match most of your outfits. If you're going for 2005 Kate Moss vibes, a black faux leather satchel that can hang over your body is a perfect shout. It's understated but cool, and can fit the festival essentials like lip gloss, face powder, and your purse. Best raincoat Let's face it, even though the sun might be shining, there's always going to be a chance of rain at Glastonbury. It's the UK, after all. But just because you have to prepare for bad weather, doesn't mean that you can't make it fashion. Opt for a pop of color when picking your raincoat, like Annie Mac did last year. If you're into the maximalist look, she also styled it with a lime green mini satchel and leopard print trousers, which is a whole festival inspo fit in itself. Best Glastonbury Raincoats Longline Transparent Festival Mac Hosbjerg Ray Tori Faux Leather Trench Coat Best accessories That dry shampoo not doing it for you anymore? As you near the end of Glastonbury (and not to sound minging), there's only so much a baby wipe wash can do. The solution? A good old hat. While Saffron Hocking understood the method dressing assignment, going for farm chic, there are so many headwear variations you can go for...."

movFt_27AD03231CEF4650A35277E7B7CAE26D,2025-06-24 22:04:04,en,WEB,"  Good morning and welcome back to FirstFT Asia. In today's newsletter: A fragile ceasefire in the Middle East The war that will remake Iran Jeff Bezos's Venice wedding draws protests China's ports in Latin America Donald Trump lashed out at both Israel and Iran as he battled to preserve the fragile truce agreed after 12 days of war between two of the Middle East's most powerful militaries. What to know: The ceasefire brokered by the US president appeared to be holding yesterday evening despite what Trump denounced as violations by both sides. “We basically have two countries that have been fighting so long and so hard that they don't know what the fuck they're doing,” he told reporters before leaving for a Nato summit in the Netherlands. 'Leaked' findings on US's Iran strike: Later in the day, the White House hit out at a “leaked” intelligence assessment that the US had failed to destroy Iran's nuclear sites in its weekend strikes. CNN reported that an early assessment by the Pentagon found that the strikes had probably only set back Iran's nuclear programme by months. The Trump administration dismissed the findings as “wrong” but appeared to acknowledge their authenticity. How the truce was brokered: Trump's ceasefire plan came together in a frenetic flurry of telephone diplomacy, with the US president pressuring Israel to accept a truce while Qatar urged Tehran to sign up. Opinion: The ceasefire is more likely to mark a pause in hostilities — rather than the definitive new start that Trump is searching for, writes Gideon Rachman. Here's what else we're keeping tabs on today: Economic data: Australia reports May CPI and Japan publishes services PPI inflation data. Nato summit: A gathering in The Hague aimed at placating Trump over defence spending continues. Monetary policy: Thailand's central bank announces its rate decision.Five more top stories 1. Trump said China could purchase oil from Iran, in an apparent reversal of policy after his administration spent months imposing sanctions on Chinese refineries for buying Iranian crude. The potential U-turn, which came hours after he declared peace in the Middle East war, would ease pressure on Beijing and Tehran. 2. A long-awaited UK government report warned that Beijing has been increasing efforts to spy on Britain and to undermine its democracy and economic security. However, the study also recommended increasing trading links with China to boost economic growth. Here's more on the UK's “most complex bilateral relationship”. 3. Indian billionaire Gautam Adani is pressing ahead with major investment plans despite the threat from US criminal charges, telling shareholders yesterday that his conglomerate's governance met global standards. The Adani Group chair announced capital spending of $15bn to $20bn a year for the next five years, at the infrastructure-focused company's annual meeting. 4. Australia is reviewing whether to expand its groundbreaking social media ban for under-16s to include YouTube, after the country's internet safety regulator said the Google-owned video sharing website was where children suffered the most online harm. 5. OpenAI and former Apple design chief Sir Jony Ive have been accused of trying to “bury” a rival start-up. The chief executive of iyO told the FT he had been “blindsided” by the launch of io, OpenAI's partnership with Ive to create new AI hardware products, as both companies had previously been in deal talks with his similarly named start-up. News in-depth For at least three decades, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the hardline centres of power that surround him have stubbornly resisted structural reforms. But the shocking repercussions of Israel and the US's assault mean that a shift in direction now seems inevitable, analysts say, setting into motion what could be the most consequential changes since the 1979 Islamic revolution.We're also reading . . . Bezos's controversial wedding: The Amazon founder's Venice wedding has become a lightning rod for protest. How does AI think? : The world's leading artificial intelligence groups are struggling to force their models to show how they operate. 'Verification problem': As technology becomes better, a return to face-to-face encounters looks more likely, writes Stephen Bush.Map of the day Chinese companies have built or operate 31 active ports in Latin America and the Caribbean, many more than previously thought, according to research by a Washington-based think-tank. Take a break from the news Last month, Dior chief executive Delphine Arnault appointed Jonathan Anderson as creative director to oversee both the men's and women's collections. Her decision to bring in the Northern Ireland-born designer is her biggest bet since she took the helm of the division in 2023.

1ljrs8r,2025-06-25 00:31:27,en,REDDIT,"  Okay, story time: My last order was kind of a chaotic blur. I knew exactly which bag I wanted… but wanted to add another small bag. In a rush to save on shipping (because apparently I think like Costco), I panic-added the Dior Street Chic to my cart. Big vibes, zero research. Classic me. It arrived. The bag? Gorgeous. The strap? A whole personality clash. It gave “ehh” when I needed “YES.” I totally should've done more research on one of the most important parts of the bag! The strap!! So naturally, I tried to rehome it here. No bites. Probably because this Reddit account is brand-spanking-new. I used to lurk repladies OG like a ghost—haunting, not participating. Anyway, fast forward to my Amazon rabbit hole where I found a Dior-inspired strap that's basically the exact same blue and gold hardware. Slapped it on, and boom: the bag I almost regret-bought is now my favorite tiny queen. Moral of the story: Is customizing your bag a faux pas? Because sure, it's not 100% original anymore… but now it's 100% me. One of a kind, baby."

For Hayti, it is a story of queens and poets, of revolution and resilience, of legends like Michel Chataigne who guard the flame, and of a global diaspora that carries it forward. It is a story that I am proud to wear, and prouder still to help write. This story begins long before the runways of Paris or Milan. It begins in the heart of Yahti Kiskeya Boyo—""The Divine Land, the Mother of all islands where my house lies” the true name of our island. It lives in the memory of Queen #Anacaona of #Xaragua, a #Cacica who was not only a leader but a poet, singer, and dancer. It flows in the blood of the #Dahomey, the #Igbo, the #Yoruba, and the #Kongo peoples of Western #Africa, whose artistry and spirituality are echoed in the very names of our folkloric dances. This ancestry is why #Haitians, whether from the wealthiest suburbs or the most humble villages, are born with art in our bones. We are destined to thrive when given a chance to shine. #HaitianFashion #MichelChataigne #MadeInHaiti #StyleAndSoul #HaitianHeritage #Karabela #AyitiKiskeyaBoyo #HaitianHistory #BlackFashionHistory #AfricanDiaspora #IndependentDesigner #CulturalPreservation #EthicalFashion #SupportHaitianArt #FashionOdyssey #FashionStorytelling #Resilience PLUS Model Magazine -  Pretty Pear Bride  QUEEN SIZE MAGAZINE The Curvy Fashionista  EBONY Media Black Enterprise Magazine Essence Magazine  NEGRO DIGEST ™  Linkedin News ELLEMAGZ Christian Dior Couture McQueen Kelly Wolfe Andrew Burnstine Ph.D  FashionTV The Fashion Network V Magazine | VMAN, LLC | VICE Media Amazon Target Mall Aventura Bal Harbour Shops Praxis"

Jusqu'ici difficile de faire le lien entre le style de la jeunesse dorée américaine et les portraits de l'artiste Jean-Michel Basquiat et de la princesse Lee Radziwill réalisés par Andy Warhol et publiés il y a quelques jours par la maison.

A ridiculously versatile solar-powered bird bath fountain pump — all you have to do is plop it in water in a traditional bird bath, planter, or backyard decor, and boom! You have a sweet little bird haven that can burble water up to a foot high for all our feathered friends to enjoy. Solatec is a small business that specializes in solar-powered outdoor products. Promising review: ""This is a fantastic little fountain with very good power. I shoots up to 12 inches in the air in direct sun. For $10 I cannot understand how it can be made and shipped."" —Ben Phillips Get it from Amazon for $10.29. 2. Moroccanoil's Mini Must-Haves Sampler, which is so affordable that I'm not not pinching myself to make sure I'm awake. Reviewers especially love these teensy versions for traveling in ~luxury~ on the cheap, and for trying these beloved splurgeworthy products without committing to the whole price first! This handy travel set includes deluxe sample sizes of Moroccanoil hair treatment, shampoo, conditioner, styling cream, and shower gel. Promising review: ""I thought this promotion was fake, but I ordered it hoping I'd get a good product — and I did! OMG! If you're thinking about trying Moroccanoil, you can totally start with these minis to see if they work for you. And let me tell you, these products are 100% recommended! They're perfect as a gift or just for your own use. So worth it!"" —Alehandra Get it from Amazon for $10. 3.

I can't tell you how many people ask about these baskets when they visit my house. If you are into the farmhouse vibes, these are the perfect addition. I hate storing things on my counter, but I love that I can always keep fresh fruit and veggies from the store or garden readily available. The kids love that it is easy to get to, and I am incredibly surprised by how strong the magnet is. I have another one in the coffee nook on the other side of the fridge that holds the coffee pods and seasonings. Love how this has saved me space."" —HereIAm Get it from Amazon for $26.98 (available in three colors). 4. Olay's Firming Body Lotion full of collagen peptides and a Vitamin B3 complex for *ultra* hydration designed to visibly plump, firm, and moisturize your skin — all at a fraction of the price of other firming lotions, like the internet's beloved $48 Elasti-Cream. Psst — there's a matching elasticity-boosting collagen body wash as well! Promising review: ""I have spent a lifetime looking for a lotion as good as this one. I am so happy to have tried this, and now I will use it forever. It smells fantastic, comes in a cute bottle, is reasonably priced, and my skin is softer and more hydrated than ever. I've tried everything for dry, itchy, sensitive skin. I use this daily, and I love it. Butters and oils leave me feeling gross and greasy, and most lotions simply do not do the job, and I'll have to reapply constantly.

mov_731D53256E116EF1FE3FD2E52792F243,2025-06-25 07:44:30,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Mascaras versprechen den perfekten Augenaufschlag. Imtest hat beliebte Wimperntuschen genauer unter die Lupe genommen. Das Ergebnis überrascht: Der Testsieger erregt Aufsehen, eine günstige Drogerie-Mascara überzeugt mit starker Leistung. Ein Augenaufschlag wie auf dem roten Teppich – dafür braucht es entweder falsche Wimpern oder eine starke Mascara. Auch einige Männer setzen laut Social Media zunehmend auf das Wimpern-Upgrade. Mascara verleiht Ausdruck, färbt, verdichtet und lässt die Wimpern länger wirken. Imtest hat verschiedene Produkte getestet – mit einem überraschendem Ergebnis. Charlotte Tilbury gewinnt den Mascara-Test An die Spitze der besten Mascaras schafft es bei Imtest die teuerste Wimperntusche im Test: Die ""Legendary Lashes Volume 2"" von Charlotte Tilbury überzeugt mit ihrer einfachen und schmierfreien Anwendung und bekommt dafür die Note 1,7 (gut). In puncto Volumen, Länge und leichtes Auftragen schnitt die Mascara am besten ab. Die Wimpern wirken lang, voluminös, dichter und sehen nicht aus wie Fliegenbeine. Das Make-up deckt hervorragend und verwischt selbst bei Regen nicht. Farbe: Schwarz Inhalt: acht Milliliter Wasserfest: ja Die starke Farbintensität lässt das Augen-Make-up laut der Tester jedoch schnell unnatürlich wirken. Für alle, die einen dezenten Look bevorzugen, ist die Designer-Mascara daher weniger geeignet. Wer hingegen den glamourösen Kim-Kardashian-Style oder echten Hollywood-Flair sucht, liegt mit diesem Produkt richtig. Ein Haken: Die ""Legendary Lashes Volume 2"" kostet satte 34 Euro – bei nur acht Millilitern Inhalt. Hinweis: Die Preise sind volatil und die Händler passen bisweilen auch die unverbindliche Preisempfehlung (UVP) an. Sollten sich die Preise von den hier angegebenen unterscheiden, haben die Händler sie nach Veröffentlichung des Artikels geändert. Testsieger mit Schadstoffen – wie schädlich ist Formaldehyd? Trotz Testsieg steht Charlotte Tilbury in der Kritik: Imtest entdeckt in der Mascara Spuren von Formaldehyd – ein Stoff, der in hohen Mengen als potenziell krebserregend gilt, in kleinen Mengen die Schleimhäute reizen kann. Damit ist die teure Wimperntusche nicht allein: Auch ein Produkt von Max Factor enthält den Stoff und landet – nicht nur deshalb – auf dem letzten Platz im Test. Drogerie-Mascara von Essence holt sich den Preis-Leistungs-Sieg Der Testsieg von Charlotte Tilbury wirft Fragen auf: Muss gute Mascara teuer sein? Imtest verneint – auch L'Oréal Paris und Essence überzeugen, ganz ohne Formaldehyd. Die ""I Love Extreme Crazy Volume""-Mascara liefert zwar weniger Volumen und Schwung als das Luxusprodukt, schenkt aber dennoch einen glamourösen Look. Endnote: 2,1 (gut). Farbe: Schwarz Inhalt: zwölf Milliliter Wasserfest: nein Essence ""I Love Extreme Crazy Volume""-Mascara 2,39 € (199,17 € / l) 2,99 € (249,17 € / l) Zum Angebot bei amazon.de Trotzdem: Zu Beginn kommt sehr viel Produkt mit, und die Wimpern verkleben schnell, wenn man beim Auftragen nicht aufpasst. Den Regentest überlebt sie ebenfalls nicht so gut. Dafür punktet aber ihr günstiger Preis: Die Mascara von Essence gibt es bereits für 2,39 Euro online und in Drogerien. Für das Geld ist die Wimperntusche dann doch eine fabelhafte Alternative zur hochpreisigen Mascara von Charlotte Tilbury. Das Drogerieprodukt für ein paar Taler kommt mit dem dritten Platz im Test relativ nah an den Testsieger heran – damit ist Essence klarer Preis-Leistungs-Gewinner. Bei der Stiftung Warentest landet die Mascara im Mittelfeld. Der Test zeigte erstaunlicherweise, dass das Drogerie-Produkt sogar um Haaresbreite mit einer High-End-Mascara von Dior mithalten konnte. Air Volume Mega Mascara von L'Oreal Paris: Was hat die preisliche Mittelklasse zu bieten? Die Air Volume Mega Mascara von L'Oréal Paris punktet im Test mit ihrem sichtbaren Volumen- und Längen-Effekt. Positiv fällt auf: Die Tusche lässt sich leicht verteilen, verklebt kaum und hält auch im Alltag zuverlässig. Zwar reicht sie in Sachen Schwung und Glamour nicht ganz an den Testsieger heran, doch mit solider Performance und ohne bedenkliche Stoffe landet sie verdient auf einem der oberen Plätze – eine verlässliche Wahl aus der Mittelklasse. Auch bei Stiftung Warentest wird die Wimperntusche gelobt und bekommt eine Bewertung von 2,4 (gut). Farbe: Schwarz Inhalt: 9,4 Milliliter Wasserfest: nein L'Oréal Paris ""Air Volume Mega""-Mascara 10,59 € (10.590,00 € / l) 14,99 € (14.990,00 € / l) Zum Angebot bei amazon.de Vor Regen oder Tränen sollten die Wimpern mit der Air Volume Mega Mascara jedoch geschützt werden, denn im Test verschmierte sie im Regentest...."

mov_07E9D1E5EE6061F7D8B0FF683BEFA09D,2025-06-25 09:29:47,en,WEB,"  Who could keep Jung Hoseok, better known as J-Hope and a member of the biggest band in the world BTS; Antoine Dupont, gold medalist and the world's top rugby player, and Bernard Arnault, chairman and chief executive officer of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton – and at times the richest man in the world – waiting in hushed silence? None other than Queen Bey. Beyoncé – on the arm of husband Jay-Z and accompanied by nephew Julez Smith – made a grand arrival at the Louis Vuitton show Tuesday night after all guests had been safely seated for several minutes, and the show had been delayed for an hour-and-a-half from its original start time. One could hear a pin drop until screams erupted outside. Fresh off three sold-out shows at Stade de France over the weekend, Beyoncé is still deep in her Cowboy Carter era, arriving in a double denim Texas tuxedo and ten-gallon hat. She was seated front and center in the forecourt of the Pompidou Center modern art museum for men's artistic director Pharrell Williams' Indian-inspired collection. J-Hope sat beside Spike Lee, who celebrated the world premiere of his latest film “Highest 2 Lowest” at the Cannes Film Festival last month. Since then he's been bouncing between France and New York City. “We got a great reception in Cannes, and I was here last week for the French Open,” he said, congratulating Coco Gauff on her winning performance. “Now I'm back to support my brother, Pharrell, and it's a beautiful night here in the City of Light. It's important, and the best place to be on earth tonight.” Jackson Wang, who collaborated with Williams' Billionaire Boys Club and Joopiter for his “Life is a Race” collection that debuted on Sunday, enjoyed a mini-reunion with his Got7 bandmate Bam Bam in the front row. Both are Louis Vuitton ambassadors. Bam Bam teased a new album on the horizon. “I would say yes, because we just finished the Got7 stuff,” he said of the band's album “Winter Heptagon,” released in January. “Now we are slowly coming out [with solo projects] one by one, and my turn is at the end of the year.” The singer debuted bleached white locks and wore a Louis Vuitton jinbei-inspired wrap jacket. “I don't know what I'm wearing, but it just looked cool,” he joked. “The traffic was crazy. It said it would take 20 minutes, but I was in the car for two hours.” More in Entertainment Ever-patient pop stars Bam Bam and Wang lingered after the show for nearly half an hour, gamely chatting and taking selfies with every fan who approached before heading backstage to greet Williams. Basketball star-turned-designer Russell Westbrook also made the front row after spending the day presenting his contemporary line, Honor the Gift. “I have a showroom here, so we are showing our spring '26 collection as well. I've been there working all day, then I came out for the show,” he said. Westbrook finds Williams' work inspiring. “He is always authentic to who he is. It's important to stay authentic to who you are, and I think he does that very well.” Other guests included Bradley Cooper, A$AP Nast, “Squid Game” star Gong Yoo, Steve Harvey and Christian Dior creative director Jonathan Anderson, who will make his highly anticipated debut at the house on Friday.

mov_EF653D116166B725FB342FA7668C56EC,2025-06-25 10:21:01,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Carlos Martorell nació en Barcelona en diciembre de 1944 en el seno de una familia de la sociedad barcelonesa. Desde muy joven destacó por su personalidad muy especial, irrepetible, unas veces arrebatadora y otras difícil, pero encantadora como la de los genios. Si he conocido a una persona entregada a servir a los demás para que disfruten ése es Carlos, capaz de conseguir que lo más difícil parezca fácil. Antes de seguir, solicito humildemente un homenaje público del Govern balear, en el que sus amigos podamos darle las gracias por todo lo que nos ha hecho vivir y disfrutar sin pedir jamás nada a cambio. La carrera profesional que eligió Carlos se aleja bastante de la que a priori se esperaba de él. Estudió Derecho en la Universidad de Barcelona. Comenzó su carrera de relaciones públicas a los 18 años organizando los momentos recreativos de los congresos internacionales de medicina, siendo su padre presidente de la Sociedad Internacional de Cirugía Cardiovascular. Es colegiado fundador del Col·legi de Publicitaris i Relacions Públiques de Catalunya. Impartió clases en la Universitat Internacional de Catalunya. En Carlos nada ha sido un regalo, al contrario, todo ese mundo que nos hubiese gustado vivir fue la consecuencia de un esfuerzo sobrehumano que, como pasa siempre en España, pocos saben entender y valorar. Ya es hora de que les demos las gracias a los que nos han hecho la vida bonita. Los que no lo conocen fliparán cuando les hable de sus logros y hazañas. Empiecen a flipar como si estuviesen en una de esas fiestas alucinógenas que creó Carlos. En 1963 fue a conocer la isla de Ibiza, entonces virgen y pobre. Se enamoró y abandonó su carrera de Derecho, en el quinto curso, para instalarse a vivir en la Ibiza hippy, en 1968. Y habló tanto de Ibiza que ese año Oriol Regás, propietario de la discoteca Bocaccio de Barcelona, le encargó que organizase un viaje para que unos 110 clientes de la discoteca pasasen tres días divertidos en la aún desconocida Ibiza. Volaron en un avión alquilado de Spantax, ocuparon todo el Hotel Montesol y bailaron todas las noches en la muy pequeña discoteca Lola's, donde Carlos había organizado la Noche de Blanco. La expedición tuvo mucho éxito y fue la primera vez que la prensa española publicó titulares como «Fiesta en Ibiza». Inconscientemente había plantado la semilla del exitoso ocio nocturno. En 1969 le enseñó la isla a Ricardo Urgell, que decidió abrir el Pacha de Ibiza. Y Carlos le ayudó a organizar la fiesta de apertura. Y, desde entonces, Carlos no paró de colaborar con Pacha, llevando a bailar incluso a miembros de la realeza como los Reyes de Bulgaria, la Princesa María Gabriela de Saboya, el Conde de Barcelona, padre del Rey Juan Carlos, la Infanta Elena, miembros de la familia de Raniero de Mónaco y muchos famosos nacionales e internacionales. Más adelante organizó las aperturas de las discotecas Amnesia, Charly Max y KU (hoy Unvers). Para la apertura de Amnesia fue a Nueva York a comprar los discos de vinilo. Y su invitada principal fue la actriz Ursula Andress. Para la apertura de KU tuvo una idea premonitoria y ecológica. Organizó el Funeral por el Mediterráneo llenando con cientos de botellas de plástico la gran piscina. Y todos los invitados iban en procesión, alrededor de las aguas, con velones en las manos, vestidos de luto obligatorio, con el Réquiem de Mozart. Carlos habla cinco idiomas y ha sido modelo de publicidad para White Horse y Desigual. En 1971 compró un triplex en Dalt Vila, que filmé para mi programa House & Style. Y alquiló una casa sin electricidad, en Sant Carles, donde pasó 35 mágicos veranos. En 1972 viajó a Nueva York y, desde entonces, pasó 17 otoños seguidos en la gran ciudad. Allí trabajó como periodista fotografiando y entrevistando a personajes muy famosos como Andy Warhol, Mick Jagger, Grace Jones, Halston, Elsa Peretti, Paloma Picasso y Liza Minelli, entre otros. Hace periodismo y colabora con el Diario de Ibiza, el Periódico de Ibiza y la revista Ibiza Live Report. Y desde hace cinco años cuenta todos los jueves las Historias de Carlos Martorell en Onda Cero Ibiza y Formentera. Durante un tiempo trabajó para la introducción del arquitecto Ricardo Bofill en París. Y es asesor de prensa del arquitecto José Ribas. Hay relaciones públicas modernos e influencers que no saben quién es esta leyenda viva que inventó una forma de trabajar para ellos. Javier Escobar y otros aprendieron mucho de su maestro. Carlos reclama su lugar en este mundo donde cabezas infantiles ganan fortunas. Ha escrito dos novelas Réquiem por Peter Pan en Ibiza (traducida en inglés en digital) y La memoria enjaulada, sobre el Alzheimer. Ambas en venta en Amazon. Y publicó el libro El Baile de Pacha, que es una joya, con Toni Riera. El Consulting de Carlos Martorell se ha ocupado de la organización de eventos, promoción y divulgación de marcas. Y entre sus clientes están Dior, Loewe, Armani, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein, Etro, Chopard, relojes Chanel, Polo Ralph Lauren, Mango, Swatch, Cartier, Tiffany, Rabat, Virgin Galactic, Charlotte Tilbury y Bru&Bru. Otra de sus especialidades es la promoción de restaurantes y hoteles, como el Montesol, Ibiza Gran Hotel, Standard Hotel y el agroturismo Atzaró, donde colaboró para las fiestas de Mango de Penélope Cruz y su hermana Mónica, y del perfume Lady Rebel. Además, ha hecho varias exposiciones de sus fotos de la India y Haití. Y ha decorado restaurantes y varias casas particulares. Su gusto estético, en cualquier ámbito, es fabuloso. Una clase auténtica sin coches de lujo ni brillantes en las orejas...."

Derweil seien die Geschäfte im März sehr gut gelaufen. Im April sei das Wachstum immer noch positiv gewesen, aber nicht so gut wie im Vormonat. Die US-Bank JPMorgan hat die Einstufung für Zalando mit einem Kursziel von 29 Euro auf ""Neutral"" belassen.

tw_sl_fa980ee74859f2aec5a3122aa91575d1,2025-06-25 13:47:16,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]Estratto dell'articolo di Michela Proietti per il “Corriere della Sera” Gli atelier di moda più importanti del mondo stanno lavorando in queste ore per valorizzare al meglio i 160 centimetri di altezza, i 90 di decolleté e il vitino da vespa, che nel mondo ideale e in quello di Lauren Sánchez coincide con il numero 60. [...] Il suo fisico, già celebrato da Bezos con una polena con le sembianze dell'amata sulla prua del suo super yacht da 127 metri Koru, sarà esaltato dalle griffe in lizza per vestirla il giorno del sì. E durante i festeggiamenti all'Isola di San Giorgio, al cospetto di 200 invitati. [...] Pare che la coppia abbia ordinato sei mesi fa il primo abito e due mesi fa l'ultimo. Sarebbero state coinvolte quasi tutte le maison haute couture, per decidere solo alla fine a quale marchio affidare quello che gli addetti ai lavori chiamano «progetto» e non una scelta d'abito qualsiasi. Secondo le indiscrezioni i cambi saranno 27 e la spesa si aggirerà intorno a un milione e mezzo di euro. [...] Per l'abito da sposa si scommette su Oscar de la Renta, in alternativa Dolce & Gabbana, marchio amato dalla ex giornalista. [...] Le incursioni parigine della coppia lascerebbero pensare anche a Dior. Ma l'addio di Maria Grazia Chiuri, con la quale sarebbe stata avviata la conversazione, potrebbe aver reso il brand meno nelle corde della Sánchez, che vorrebbe un abito opulento o istituzionale. Proprio come Oscar de la Renta, che ha il plus di essere americano e caldeggiato da Anna Wintour, cara amica della coppia (per il Met Gala del 2012 Mr Amazon ha elargito 1 milione di euro). Ma il fatto che Lauren abbia scelto Oscar de la Renta per l'addio al nubilato a Parigi potrebbe far diminuire le probabilità: dato il «contentino», adesso potrebbe rivolgersi altrove, seguendo i suoi stylist. A Parigi i Sanzos o i Bezanchez (chissà quale sarà l'acronimo della coppia) sarebbero stati visti all'atelier Schiaparelli in Place Vendôme: pare che la Sánchez abbia una passione per le creazioni di Daniel Roseberry, anche lui americano e anche lui apprezzato da Anna Wintour. Non è passato inosservato, per l'insediamento di Trump, il cappotto di mohair bianco del brand, sfilato in fretta per mostrare le forme generose. Ma la coppia è stata vista passeggiare ad aprile anche in via Monte Napoleone, a Milano, per una prova abiti da Dolce & Gabbana, che due anni fa ha mandato in passerella il figlio di lei Nikko Gonzalez, nato da uno dei due precedenti matrimoni. [...] In tutto questo, come tradizione, a nessuno importa di cosa indosserà Bezos. Ma è probabile che tutto passi al filtro di Lanza e Baucina, la società di wedding planner che fa capo a tre cugini aristocratici italiani con sede a Londra e che potrebbe aver indirizzato il magnate verso una sartoria di Savile Row. Nel toto-abiti spuntano Ralph Lauren per nazionalismo o di nuovo Dolce & Gabbana: a Milano ci sarebbe stato anche un fitting di coppia."

Fața întunecată a lui Alain Delon, care este acum pusă pe tapet, arată cum acesta a fost, în căsnicie, un bărbat violent. Odată, și-a bătut soția atât de tare încât aceasta a avut nasul și coastele rupte. Mai mult, Alain Delon a ajuns până acolo încât și-a amenințat propriul fiu cu pistolul. Alain Delon dormea mereu cu o armă încărcată sub pernă. Multe dintre aceste episoade au avut loc departe de ochii publicului, în spatele porților închise ale domeniului de la Douchy, unde drama și teroarea au fost constante. Fața întunecată a lui Alain Delon Cartea, intitulată „Ultimele zile ale samuraiului”, pune sub semnul întrebării imaginea idealizată a lui Alain Delon, aducând în prim-plan mărturii tulburătoare despre violență domestică, abuz emoțional și o obsesie periculoasă pentru arme de foc. Un portret dur, dar necesar, al unei legende care, dincolo de ecran, a fost – potrivit fiului său – un om cu laturi profund întunecate. Alain Fabien Delon a povestit sincer ce viață violentă a avut familia alături de tatăl său (Foto: Instagram) „Îngerul cu sânge rece” al epocii de aur a cinematografiei franceze, cum a fost el supranumit, Alain Delon a fost mereu perceput ca o figură seducătoare, dar învăluită de un aer amenințător. Cartea care conține mărturiile fiului său cel mai mic, Alain-Fabien Delon, sunt cumplite. Acesta îl acuză pe tatăl său de violență domestică extremă, obiceiuri periculoase și o obsesie patologică pentru armele de foc – mergând până acolo încât dormea cu un pistol încărcat sub pernă chiar și la bătrânețe. Ultima parteneră a actorului, chinuită și agresată constant Alain-Fabien susține că tatăl său ar fi agresat-o fizic de nenumărate ori, inclusiv pe ultima sa parteneră, Hiromi Rollin – în două ocazii aproape omorând-o. Ar fi amenințat-o cu o armă, spunându-i direct că vrea să o omoare. Mai mult, fiul actorului susține că tensiunea din familie era omniprezentă în copilărie. Își amintește cum mama sa a fost bătută brutal. Alain Dellon și Hiromi Rollin, îngrijitoarea care i-a devenit parteneră, și care i-a fost alături 17 ani. Există mărturii despre bătăile pe care i le aplica (Foto: Instagram) „I-a spart capul, i-a rupt nasul de două ori, i-a fracturat opt coaste”, își amintește Alain-Fabien. Model de profesie și ambasador Dior, Alain-Fabien povestește cum tatăl l-a închis într-o cușcă cu câinii, peste noapte, pentru a fi „călit”.   El descrie, de asemenea, comportamentul crud și violent al tatălui său față de Hiromi Rollin, o femeie de origine japoneză, care i-a fost asistentă și îngrijitoare timp de 17 ani – dar pe care el o consideră, fără îndoială, partenera lui Delon. „Nu mai pot număra de câte ori a bătut-o”, mărturisește el. În carte apar și alte relatări tulburătoare: o prietenă a lui Rollin spune că a văzut-o cu ochii vineți, plină de vânătăi și urme de degete pe față. Într-o declarație oficială către poliție, Hiromi Rollin afirmă că a fost lovită cu picioarele, strangulată și amenințată cu arma de actorul francez. Chinurile femeii nu s-au sfârșit nici după ce Alain Delon a suferit un AVC în 2019 și a ajuns dependent de îngrijire. În iulie 2023, Hiromi Rollin a fost evacuată de pe domeniul Douchy de către copiii actorului, iar ea a reclamat la poliție că bunurile i-au fost incendiate. Dintre cei trei copii ai lui Delon, doar Alain-Fabien a recunoscut public că Hiromi Rollin i-a fost iubită tatălui. „Pentru mine, ea a fost partenera lui. Punct. Am crescut cu Hiromi. Era mereu acolo”, susține tânărul. Obsesia pentru arme de foc. S-au găsit cu zecile, plus mii de cartușe O altă latură întunecată a bătrâneților lui Delon este prezentată în detaliu în carte: actorul ar fi transformat proprietatea din Douchy într-un adevărat arsenal. Într-un raid din februarie 2024, jandarmeria a descoperit 72 de arme de foc și peste 3.000 de cartușe – toate deținute ilegal. Delon păstra un pistol încărcat chiar în propriul pat, dormind cu el sub pernă, se mai arată în carte, conform Lipstickalley.com. Încă din tinerețe, Alain Delon a cucerit cinematografia mondială cu chipul și talentul său (Foto: Instagram) Fiul său povestește cum a încercat să-l protejeze, scoțând gloanțele din arme, dar fratele său Anthony le-a pus la loc, motivând că este sigur că tatăl lor nu avea să se sinucidă. Într-o seară din 2023, Alain Delon, în vârstă și bolnav, ar fi îndreptat pistolul spre fiul său la întoarcerea acestuia acasă. De atunci, Alain-Fabien a început să înlocuiască gloanțele reale cu unele false, fără știrea tatălui său. Volumul „Ultimele zile ale samuraiului” a fost scris de jurnaliștii francezi de investigație Laurence Pieau și François Vignolle (Foto: Amazon) „Până în ultima clipă, a fost convins că doarme cu un pistol încărcat”, a mai declarat Alain jr. Toate aceste dezvăluiri sunt cuprinse în volumul „Ultimele zile ale samuraiului”, scris de jurnaliștii francezi de investigație Laurence Pieau și François Vignolle. Este amintit în carte și un episod mai vechi, din 1968, când actorul a fost implicat într-un scandal mafiot după moartea prietenului și fostului său bodyguard, Stevan Markovic, al cărui cadavru a fost găsit aruncat la marginea Parisului. Se crede că Markovic ar fi organizat o orgie în casa lui Alain Delon, filmată cu camere ascunse, unde ar fi apărut inclusiv soția viitorului președinte Georges Pompidou. Principalul suspect de crimă a fost liderul corsican François Marcantoni."

I festeggiamenti inizieranno nel chiostro della chiesa della Madonna dell'Orto. L'hotel Aman scelto per il soggiorno è un sette stelle lusso sul Canal Grande. Si tratta dello stesso resort che ospitò il party di nozze di George Clooney e Amal Alamuddin nel 2014. Sono oltre 200 gli invitati al matrimonio.

1lkklms,2025-06-25 23:13:07,en,REDDIT,"  I currently use Another 13 but the bottle is about to run out. I've gotten many compliments through my two years or so of using it, but I'd like to explore another scent. I'm by no means a fragrance expert or guru to know the correct terminologies or methodologies, but I would like a somewhat similar scent that is masculine but still sweet. I've narrowed my list down to Replica's Mason Margiela Jazz Club, Aqua Di Parma Colonia Essence Eau De Cologne, Montblanc's Explorer, Christian Dior's Homme and Homme Intense, and then lastly Stronger with You OG and Intensely. I've heard that Stronger with You is better for Winter, and seeing as it's summer and I tend to sweat somewhat easily (while being athletic and lean), it doesn't seem like the best pick. I've heard that Jazz Club is good but can get tiresome with excessive notes of tobacco. It seems like Montblanc's Explorer isn't necessarily sweet but I'm not married to the idea of a sweet scent, it's just what I'm used to and have received compliments for in the past. I used Versace Eros a few years back but I thought it was too much of a club scent on me. I'm also willing to hear any suggestions outside of what I've listed. I do plan on ordering online so that is a factor, but I'm going on Amazon/other sites that have somewhat lower prices. I'm not picky and I am doing my due diligence to research so I don't expect to be particularly disappointed even if what I pick is a ""bust."" Anyway, this sub is filled with individuals far more knowledgeable than I am and I was just looking for some help and guidance. Appreciate all feedback! Thank you all."

mov_1802AAD87B5E4945639E2956CC3AD846,2025-06-26 01:23:52,en,WEB,"  Luxury fashion houses are making a notable move into the hospitality sector, with a growing number launching branded hotels, resort collaborations, and exclusive spa experiences. From Dior's summer residency at The Little Nell in Aspen to Bulgari's expanding hotel empire, the lines between fashion and hospitality continue to blur as designers seek new ways to deepen consumer engagement. What began as seasonal pop-ups and co-branded events has evolved into full-scale hotel and resort projects. The trend is led by brands such as Versace, Dior, Missoni, and Bulgari, each offering immersive experiences that extend their aesthetic beyond clothing and accessories. In March 2024, Palazzo Versace opened in Macau, delivering a 271-room property styled in the fashion house's opulent identity. Bulgari, which opened its first hotel in Milan in 2004, now operates nine branded hotels worldwide, with new locations in Miami Beach and the Maldives scheduled to open by 2026. The Rome-based jeweller aims to replicate its meticulous design ethos in hospitality, describing each hotel as being ""crafted like a jewel"", according to Bulgari executive Silvio Ursini. Dior's partnership with The Little Nell last summer showcased another model. The fashion house reimagined the poolside and spa areas of the Colorado property with its signature Jouy Soleil toile, Dior-branded menus, and luxury skincare treatments. The success of this project has led Dior to open its first permanent spa in Italy, located at the refurbished Belmond Splendido in Portofino. The movement is not limited to full hotel ventures. Several designers are contributing individual suites, spa residencies, and leisure experiences. Diane von Furstenberg, for instance, designed a branded suite at Hotel Amigo in Brussels, featuring bold prints and personal memorabilia, reflecting both style and heritage. Meanwhile, collaborations between fashion labels and established resorts are gaining traction. The Verdura Resort in Sicily introduced the Missoni Resort Club, which included beachwear-styled loungers, a themed cocktail menu, and a dedicated boutique. In Florida, Vilebrequin launched a Cabana Club at the Beach Club in Boca Raton, offering bungalows featuring the swimwear brand's vibrant patterns. Looking ahead, Louis Vuitton is set to open its first hotel on the Champs Élysées in 2026, a development that could mark a significant moment in the convergence of luxury fashion and branded accommodation. Short-term pop-ups remain a key part of the strategy. Brands are teaming up with resorts, trains, and yachts to offer temporary but high-impact experiences. This summer, Dior has joined with Belmond for a four-day wellness journey aboard the Royal Scotsman train through the Scottish Highlands. Balmain, Guerlain, and Valentino also have partnerships underway across the Mediterranean, including at resorts in Greece, Spain, and France. In the US, Michael Kors has launched a Jet Set package with the Montauk Yacht Club, featuring branded travel items and bespoke spa and dining experiences. Other fashion houses are focusing on limited edition collections and in-resort boutiques—such as CDLP's leisurewear range at Lake Como's Passalacqua, and Hublot's exclusive watch collaboration with Eden Rock in St. Barth's. These initiatives not only drive brand visibility but offer luxury travellers curated environments that mirror the identity of their favourite labels. They also provide retailers with a long-form platform to engage consumers beyond the brief retail interaction. As seasonal launches and permanent properties continue to emerge, the integration of luxury fashion and high-end hospitality appears to be more than a passing trend. The expansion is reshaping the guest experience, turning hotel stays into extended encounters with brand identity and lifestyle narratives.

Venecia se prepara para ser el epicentro del glamour mundial con la boda de Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sánchez. El fundador de Amazon y la periodista estadounidense han organizado una ceremonia que promete ser tan lujosa como exclusiva, con una lista de invitados cuidadosamente seleccionada y una logística sin precedentes. Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sánchez | Foto: Agencia México Uno de los momentos más esperados será el espectáculo musical a cargo de Elton John y Lady Gaga, quienes actuarán para los novios y sus 200 invitados. La celebración se desarrollará del 26 al 29 de junio en varios lugares emblemáticos de Venecia, como la isla de San Giorgio Maggiore, la Scuola Grande della Misericordia y el yate Koru de Bezos, valorado en 500 millones de dólares. El costo del evento se estima entre 10 y 30 millones de dólares, con un gasto promedio de 50,000 dólares por asistente. Para el traslado de los invitados, se han reservado cinco de los hoteles más exclusivos de la ciudad, como el Aman Venice, el Gritti Palace y el St. Regis, además de contratar más de 60 taxis acuáticos y góndolas privadas. Celebridades invitadas Entre los asistentes destacan celebridades como Oprah Winfrey, Beyoncé, George Clooney, Kim Kardashian, Tom Cruise, Ivanka Trump y Jared Kushner. Aunque no se ha confirmado quiénes serán los padrinos, se especula que amigos cercanos como Anna Wintour o el productor Brian Grazer podrían asumir ese rol simbólico. Los atuendos Lauren Sánchez vestirá un diseño exclusivo de Oscar de la Renta y tendrá hasta 27 cambios de vestuario durante los tres días de festividades. La periodista ha colaborado con casas de moda como Dolce & Gabbana, Dior y Schiaparelli para crear un repertorio que refleje su estilo audaz y elegante. Por su parte, Jeff Bezos, llevará un traje hecho a medida, posiblemente de Ralph Lauren o de una sastrería de Savile Row. Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sánchez Jeff Bezos, de 61 años, es el fundador de Amazon y uno de los hombres más ricos del mundo, con una fortuna estimada en más de 220 mil millones de dólares. Tras su divorcio de MacKenzie Scott en 2019, comenzó una relación con Lauren Sánchez, de 55 años, una periodista galardonada con un Emmy, piloto certificada y fundadora de la empresa de filmación aérea Black Ops Aviation. Ambos tienen hijos de relaciones anteriores: Bezos es padre de cuatro, mientras que Sánchez tiene tres. Además de Amazon, Bezos lidera Blue Origin, su compañía espacial, y ha invertido miles de millones en causas benéficas como el Bezos Earth Fund. Sánchez ha sido vicepresidenta de dicho fondo y ha promovido proyectos de sostenibilidad y liderazgo femenino en la aviación. Su unión no solo es una historia de amor, sino también una poderosa alianza de influencia y visión compartida."

Bukan hanya karena isi pesannya yang tidak biasa, tapi juga karena desainnya yang dinilai jauh dari ekspektasi pesta miliaran dolar milik salah satu orang terkaya dunia. Dalam undangan tersebut, pasangan Bezos dan Sanchez secara eksplisit meminta tamu untuk tidak membawa hadiah. Sebagai gantinya, mereka menyumbangkan dana atas nama para tamu ke sejumlah lembaga, yakni: - UNESCO Venice Office untuk perlindungan warisan budaya Venesia, - CORILA untuk pelestarian ekosistem laguna, - Venice International University untuk mendukung riset dan pendidikan berkelanjutan. Foto: Undangan pernikahan Jeff Bezos dan Lauren Sanchez. (Dok. CNN Internasional via GMA) ""Tempat ajaib ini telah memberi kami kenangan yang tak terlupakan,"" tulis mereka dilasir CNN Intenrational, Kamis (26/6/2025). ""Kami berharap, lewat upaya ini dan kehadiran Anda, Venesia akan terus menginspirasi keajaiban bagi generasi mendatang."" Namun, yang mencuri perhatian publik bukan hanya isi pesannya, tapi juga tampilannya. Desain undangan yang dicetak dengan huruf miring bergaya klasik dan dihiasi gambar burung, bintang jatuh, kupu-kupu, gondola, dan Jembatan Rialto ini malah disebut mirip gambar clip art Microsoft Word tahun 2000-an. Banyak yang menyebut tampilannya seperti buatan rumah, tapi bukan dalam arti elegan atau artistik. Beberapa warganet menilai desain ini tidak sesuai dengan status Bezos sebagai miliarder. Namun gaya ini dinilai konsisten dengan citra ""tech bro"" yang melekat pada pendiri Amazon, yakni sederhana, praktis, dan anti-glamor. Sebagai perbandingan, undangan pernikahan Pangeran Harry dan Meghan Markle dicetak dengan mesin vintage dari tahun 1930-an, sementara Dior baru-baru ini mengirimkan undangan berbentuk piring porselen dengan telur pink menempel untuk debut desainer barunya. Bezos dan Sanchez memang tengah menjadi sorotan. Pernikahan mereka yang dijadwalkan berlangsung 26-28 Juni di Venesia ini bahkan memicu protes dari warga lokal. Kehadiran para tamu selebritas dan ancaman demonstrasi membuat lokasi acara sempat mengalami perubahan mendadak.

D0D3A09388DDC573C26880D97A943EB9,2025-06-26 07:25:52,en,PRINT,"  A large trove of the princess' belongings including her Lady Dior handbag, will be auctioned this week. For some buyers, more intimate items are the main draw. One of the stranger lots that Martin Nolan, a co-founder of Julien's Auctions, ever put on the block during his more than two decades in the auction business was a thin slice of cake served at the July 1981 wedding of Diana, Princess of Wales, to Prince Charles. It sold for $2,831. That was in 2008. Today, Mr. Nolan estimates that it could fetch tens of thousands of dollars. ''We've noticed over the years that Diana is highly collectible as an asset class,'' Mr. Nolan said in a recent phone interview. '' She's considered a blue chip as an investment. Also, people feel they have a connection to Diana.'' The world had just 16 years to get acquainted with the princess, Mr. Nolan said, referring to the time between her official entrance into public life and her untimely death in 1997. The brevity of that period, he said, has only intensified public fascination. Many now seek out Diana memorabilia in an effort to preserve the connections they feel they had with her. That demand has pushed auction houses to put an increasing number of her belongings up for sale. This Thursday, Julien's is auctioning a large collection of her personal effects, alongside a selection of items from other royals including Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Margaret. On offer are Diana's Lady Dior bag (which was renamed as a tribute to her), dresses and hats and a group of more intimate pieces such as personal letters, birthday cards and holiday cards. A portion of the proceeds from the sale will be donated to Muscular Dystrophy UK. At high-profile auctions that follow the death of public figures -- and continue years later, provided demand remains -- items like clothing, furniture, jewelry and photographs are standard. But deeply personal objects have become increasingly common. When Christie's auctioned Marilyn Monroe's estate in 1999, items on offer included her driver's license, her Screen Actors Guild card and old tubes of lipstick. RR Auction's sale of Prince memorabilia featured hotel receipts and his personal checkbook. Another Christie's auction, of former President Ronald Reagan's estate, included doodles he sketched on White House stationery. Curators say they include these items because they help contextualize and humanize public figures. ''I get really excited whenever you can see the journey of an individual and really speak to the parts of their history that they're best known for,'' said Elizabeth Seigel, head of private and iconic collections at Christie's. '' It's also fun when you're able to lift the curtain into somebody's personality a little bit.'' For the upcoming Julien's sale, titled ''Princess Diana's Style & a Royal Collection,'' Mr. Nolan is placing special emphasis on style. While her taste in fashion is certainly represented, he said the goal is to show how Diana lived and connected with others, which is why the personal cards and letters are such a key part of the offering. But there is a curatorial line to walk. '' There is a benefit to editing,'' Ms. Seigel noted. '' We don't necessarily always recommend selling every single thing that belonged to a person.'' The inclusion of deeply personal letters comes down to more than just storytelling, however. It is also about what items are likely to sell. These intimate items often carry a lower price tag than a designer bag or antique furniture, which can open up the bidding pool and give buyers who don't frequent auctions a rare chance to own a piece of history. So who is buying this stuff? In the case of Princess Diana memorabilia, it is often super-collectors like Renae Plant. Ms. Plant, a preschool director in Los Angeles, owns more than 2,700 personal items that once belonged to Diana, a collection she amassed from what she estimates to be over 2,000 auctions. Her collection includes more than 600 personal letters the princess had written to friends, family, her fitness trainer and her hairstylist. She also owns more than 100 pieces of Diana's clothing, including the black sheep sweater (not the original, which sold for $1.1 million, but the replacement she was sent after the original developed a hole) and the custom Versace dress she had worn for a photo shoot in 1991, with one of the images from that shoot being used on the cover of Harper's Bazaar following her death in 1997. Ms. Plant is proud to mention that she got that dress by outbidding Kensington Palace, even though she had to mortgage her home to afford the $250,000 winning bid. Ms. Plant, who felt that Diana's belongings were ''being scattered aimlessly all around the world and being sold to the highest bidder,'' saw it as her personal mission to honor the princess' sartorial and humanitarian legacy. In 2020, she founded The Princess Diana Museum, a digital archive built around her private collection. Diana actually started the sell-off of many of the items connected to her when, in 1997, just two months before her death, she auctioned off 79 of her gowns through Christie's, raising $3.25 million for AIDS and cancer charities. ''It's hurting my heart again to kind of see this big collection go out at one time and not be able to preserve them for the museum, because I feel like that's where they deserve to be, not in someone's cupboard,'' said Ms. Plant. Ms. Plant, whose collection is currently stowed in two storage units in Los Angeles, plans to organize a touring exhibition next year to bring the museum across the United States, Australia and Britain. But before that can happen, Ms. Plant is eyeing an acquisition: the princess' Bellville Sassoon Floral Day Dress, which is frequently called the ''Caring Dress'' because of how often Diana wore it when visiting the sick. That dress is part of the Julien's auction on Thursday. Ms. Plant saw the dress up close when Diana wore it in 1988 to greet crowds outside St. Andrew's Cathedral in Sydney, Australia. Because of her own personal history with the dress, Ms. Plant believes it would complete her collection. ''I am going to bid live,'' she said. '' I like to see the room, feel the room. I am a very strategic bidder and I always fall on the floor when I win...."

d831f2c611504d742e3a42c728f48eed,2025-06-26 10:35:00,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]Il signor Amazon si sposa. E questo lo sa anche l'ultimo campanile di Venezia. Tutta la laguna (dintorni compresi) è stata destabilizzata dal 25 al 29 giugno per il matrimonio di Jeff Bezos con l'ex giornalista Lauren Sanchez, che adesso - non avendo un caz*o da fare da mattina a sera, beata lei - fa la “filantropa” e decide a quali buone cause dedicare i miliardi di miliardi di Jeff, senza dimenticare di includere tanti Bezos a tutti (questa ce la tenevamo in serbo da un po', vi preghiamo di ridere fragorosamente). Nonostante le valanghe di soldi spesi, però, Mister Pacco col Sorriso non è riuscito a comprare il silenzio di tutti. Originariamente l'evento era previsto nella storica Scuola Grande della Misericordia, edificio seicentesco nel cuore della città, ma… apriti cielo! Gruppi di protesta come “No Space for Bezos” e ""Laboratorio Occupato Morion"" hanno sia minacciato simboliche azioni (tipo gonfiare coccodrilli nei canali per bloccare i boat-taxi in arrivo, questa a noi è piaciuta moltissimo), sia realizzato un vero e proprio messaggio col botto: un mega lenzuolo aperto a favore di drone che recitava “Se ti puoi comprare Venezia puoi anche pagare più tasse” (Tiè). Così, per evitare disordini e tutelare gli ospiti (di cui vi diremo poi perché praticamente non bastano tutte le gondole in città per portare loro e tutte le valigie), l'evento è stato spostato d'urgenza all'Arsenale, zona più defilata e facilmente isolabile dagli accessi via terra e acqua. Insomma, lontano i rompicoglioni! Festeggiamenti sobri Ma che faranno Bezos, Sanchez e compagnia cantante per cinque giorni?! Si è partiti alla grandissima giovedì con una serata inaugurale in stile “Gatsby” con suggestioni anni '20 (del secolo scorso, perché in questo secolo hanno poco da ispirare); si prosegue sabato con una cerimonia all'aperto sull'isola di San Giorgio Maggiore, nello spazio del Teatro Verde della Fondazione Giorgio Cini, con vista sulla Basilica e sul campanile da 99 metri. Qui canterà Matteo Bocelli… sì, è figlio di Andrea Bocelli. Sabato si andrà poi nell'imponente spazio dell'Arsenale, nei locali delle Nappe, per una festa da sogno con tanto di concerto (pare) di Lady Gaga. La gestione della festa è stata affidata a Lanza & Baucina, agenzia londinese celebre per eventi di ultra lusso come il matrimonio di George e Amal Clooney… sempre a Venezia, peraltro: si vede che tira più una gondola di un carro di buoi. Il guardaroba da sposa di Lauren Sánchez Per questi giorni di ""passione"", Lauren Sánchez ha passato mesi a preparare il guardaroba. Se le spose “comuni” impazziscono per identificare il solo abito da cerimonia e de eventualmente il cambio per la festa, lei ha voluto fare la sborona e ha messo insieme una cabina armadio ambulante: 27 cambi d'abito previsti tra eventi di gala, cerimonia e party a tema. Per il vestito da sposa principale, sembra confermato un modello Oscar de la Renta, realizzato su misura per lei con la consulenza addirittura di Madame Vogue, Anna Wintour. Però, nei giorni scorsi, la futura sposa è stata vista con Bezos in boutique italiane di alto livello come Dolce & Gabbana a Milano, quindi non è detto che non ci siano dei colpi di scena. Quotazioni dei bookmaker anche per Valentino, Christian Dior e Galia Lahav (che noi poracci non sapevamo manco chi fosse). Jet privati in modalità invasiva A differenza del vertice G7 di Kananaskis – dove si contarono 62 jet – per il matrimonio veneto di Jeff e Lauren sono attesi tra i 90 e i 100 jet privati negli aeroporti del Veneto (Marco Polo di Venezia, Treviso, Verona). Un numero record, che non ha mancato di creare parecchie rotture di maroni ai tre scali, tutto sommato piccolini: voli di linea deviati, code all'aviazione generale e malcontenti tra residenti e operatori aeronautici. Gli arrivi privati sommati a quelli di linea hanno acceso un bel polemicone sull'impatto ambientale e sociale di un evento privato. Oltre ai jet, la mondanità si riverserà anche nei canali. Attesi 9 mega-yacht, fra cui lo storico «Koru» di Bezos (da soli 500 milioni di dollari), ritenuto troppo esposto per attraccare nel centro e rimasto in Croazia e il 60‑metri Ariencè del finanziere Bill Miller, parcheggiato davanti a Punta della Dogana. Taxi d'acqua e gondole sarebbero praticamente tutti prenotati secondo alcuni media locali, anche se il Comune nega ufficialmente. Ospiti da Instagram La guest‑list della coppia è a dir poco scintillante: Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry, Cindy Crawford, Mick Jagger, Bill Gates, Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Shakira, Robert Pattinson, Karlie Kloss, Elton John, Diane von Fürstenberg, Barbra Streisand, Orlando Bloom, la regina Rania di Giordania, Mark Zuckerberg, e via andare fino a circa 200/250. Per motivi di privacy e per evitare infiltrazioni di giornalisti o manifestanti, gli sposi hanno mantenuto la location segreta fino all'ultimo. Gli invitati sono stati indirizzati al “campo base” di Aman Venice, e hanno scoperto le location reali solo il giorno del loro arrivo. Ogni accesso è severamente sorvegliato, dal canale all'entrata via terra, da circa 20 agenti e uno schieramento di corpi speciali. Imposta anche una zona no‑fly attorno a San Giorgio e l'Arsenale per impedire sorvoli indesiderati. Ci saranno i cecchini a controllare i droni?! Agli ospiti Bezos e futura signora avrebbero chiesto donazioni a favore di enti benefici veneti che si occupano di cultura e ambiente (che paraculi!) , compresa la tutela dell'ecosistema lagunare… che rischiano di lasciare ai minimi termini dopo il loro sobrio passaggio. E a proposito di cash, ma quanto costa tutta sta baracconata?! Le stime arrivano fino a 50 milioni di euro. Consegnati in comodi pacchetti di cartone. Seguici anche su Instagram, taaac!"

The Middle East, helped by strong tourist flows and local wealth, has bucked a recent global slowdown in luxury sales that is expected to deepen this year, with some brands growing sales there at double-digit rates. Luxury sales in Gulf countries were up 6% to $12.8 billion of the nearly $400 billion market last year, outpacing a global drop of 2%, with strong appetite for high-end fashion, jewellery and beauty products, retail consultant Chalhoub Group said. However, that trade is heavily dependent on the region's burgeoning tourist trade, with consulting firm Bain estimating that some 50-60% of the Middle East's luxury sales come from tourists. This month's outbreak of an air war between Israel and Iran emphasised the ongoing risks in a region in which unrest was already simmering, with airlines cancelling flights and rerouting planes following Israel's strikes against Iran on June 13 - measures that are now being unwound. ""At this point, we have not adjusted our long-term growth forecast, as we continue to see considerable potential in the region,"" said Federica Lovato, senior partner at Bain. ""However, short-term volatility has increased in the last few weeks and may continue, depending on how the situation develops."" The region is an important hub for travel spending, favoured by Russian oligarchs but also wealthy Asians, and has increased in importance since Russia's invasion of Ukraine triggered sanctions and the rerouting of flights between Europe and Asia from more northerly routes to the Middle East. It also serves as a gateway for high-end brands to reach wealthy shoppers from India, where high tariffs have kept companies like LVMH from expanding store networks. Max Heinemann, co-CEO of travel retail group Gebr Heinemann, which recently expanded into Saudi Arabia and operates airport fashion retail stores carrying luxury brands in Jeddah, said the region's travel market has shown long-term resilience despite unrest. He remains optimistic. ""Dips may be witnessed, but growth will remain,"" he said. At Prada, first-quarter sales in the region rose 26% year-on-year, while Hermes' sales there were up 14%. High-end fashion and jewellery brands have been opening new stores and hosting splashy events. Milan-based menswear label Zegna this month took its spring collection to the opera house in Dubai, the region's leading luxury hub, for a catwalk show in an elaborate set evoking an Italian villa. Elie Saab held its 45th anniversary show in Riyadh last November, featuring a performance from Celine Dion. Dior, Saint Laurent and Valentino last year opened stores in Bahrain, while this year Louis Vuitton brought guests to the Dubai desert for a dawn meal and Chanel hosted a dinner in Abu Dhabi linked to a high jewellery launch. But maintaining visitor numbers to Middle Eastern destinations will be vital to bringing shoppers through the doors. Luxury travel agency Global Travel Moments says that for now, its long-term travel volumes to the Middle East have been unaffected by the latest unrest. However, given recent events, there is currently ""certainly more caution"" before finalizing trips to the broader Middle East, it said.

We make it same using original fragrances from France but basically cheaper. So 30,50,80 ML. And we name the product differently like Savage d'Or, or Gocci bloom instead of Gucci bloom. Is it allowed to sell these? The fragrances are made using original french attar tho."

A year ago, I made the bold decision to leave my full-time role as a Behavioural Scientist - a job, a team, and a mission I deeply loved - to begin a new chapter as a Master in Marketing student at HEC Paris. It was a leap into the unknown, but one I knew I needed to take. Today, I'm proud to say: I graduated. This past year has been intense and fast-paced - equal parts learning, evolving, and transforming. It brought brilliant people into my life, unforgettable memories, and challenges that stretched me far beyond my comfort zone. Working on real-world projects with L'Oréal, DDB, Amazon, Parfums Christian Dior, Cartier, Djula, Opella Sanofi, Veepee, and Westfield was far more than academic. Each collaboration sharpened my ability to think quickly, act strategically, and merge creativity with business impact. This Master's became the perfect bridge between my behavioural science roots and my passion for creativity, insights, and product thinking. It taught me to connect disciplines, broaden perspectives, and strengthen my voice as a marketeer. Thank you, Gachoucha Kretz, PhD and Marion BOUYOU, for shaping such a transformative experience. And now, a new journey begins. I'm honoured to share that I have accepted an offer to join the Consumer & Market Insights team at L'Oréal Luxe Division as an intern. The beauty industry has been close to my heart since my first job as a makeup artist - and I couldn't imagine a better place than L'Oréal to take this next step. Thank you, Margaux Rica, for trusting me with this incredible opportunity, and Julien Brossard, for your continues support and encouragement in this process. I'm beyond excited to help Create the Beauty That Moves the World. ✨"
mov_5F470EF6B40376B901ACFC8E70989BE7,2025-06-26 12:37:04,en,WEB,"  Hey there, Collectors: Metz from the Mantel team here, filling in this week! Hope everyone that attended had a great time at Fanatics Fest and a sincere thanks to everyone who stopped by the Mantel booth and those that shared their story with us. With that done we can all relax until we have to start prepping for The National. Which is in, checks notes, 34 DAYS!?! Before true panic sets in, let's break down some of the stories from this past week. Replay Sports Cards, the first national franchise concept dedicated exclusively to sports cards, is now seeking franchisees. Traditionally, card shops have been local small businesses, owned by individuals with a dream and a passion for cardboard. It's an interesting juxtaposition, every local card shop (LCS) you've probably visited has been completely unique, while the term ""chain"" conjures images of uniformity in the likes of brands like McDonald's, Walmart, and Chili's. How will this first generation of ""chain"" card shops compare to your standalone LCS? Gamestop has also been exploring this territory, increasingly dedicating retail shelf space to cards as more games shift to digital-only distribution. But it doesn't feel like a cards store- at least not yet. Is the era of chain card stores upon us, or is the charm and authenticity of a family-owned LCS impossible to replicate? Celebrities have the paparazzi, and athletes have autograph hawks—both can make their targets feel uncomfortable and spoil genuine encounters for real fans. When and where is it appropriate to ask athletes for autographs? Is it acceptable to wait outside a hotel and request an autograph that you intend to list on eBay just hours later? This article outlines reasonable etiquette guidelines we believe are fair: ask only once, never request more than one item, approach athletes only in public spaces, and always let kids go first. Panini shared this video on Wednesday of some of the most insane Caitlin Clark cards you've ever seen. With numerous 1/1's selling for 6 figures this year alone these sets will no doubt fly off the shelves when available. In the video you can see National Treasures, Flawless, Noir, and Contenders, sets that have previously not had WNBA releases. At the time of this post it's unclear whether these will be individual WNBA sets or something else entirely. With the price of WNBA hobby boxes rivaling or exceeding NBA boxes this year we don't even want to know what the price point will be when these boxes are released later this year. A large collection of Princess Diana's belongings, including her Lady Dior handbag, will be auctioned this week. According to the article, more intimate items are the primary attraction, despite often having lower price tags. Such items open the auction to a broader audience—people who don't usually participate in auctions but who still desire to own a rare piece of history. Do you own memorabilia from celebrities or historical figures? Be sure to share it on Mantel. Search “Honus Wagner T206” in Google News and you will get dozens of recent examples talking about this auction for a PSA 1 Honus Wagner that ended this weekend. The auction was quickly bid up to over $3.5M upon opening, but that apparently wasn't enough. The card went unsold as the reserve was not met. With the last Honus Wagner T206 selling for over $7M in 2022 one can only speculate what this means for the Hobby. Was the reserve too high? Is the trading card market slowing down? Has Honus lost his luster? Let us know what you think. During his appearance at Fanatics Fest this past weekend, LeBron James unveiled his first collaboration with Richard Mille. The new RM 65-01 is a limited edition of 150 pieces, blending James' style with RM's signature craftsmanship. This isn't James' first foray into watches; in 2013, he collaborated with Audemars Piguet on a special edition of the Royal Oak Offshore. Looking it up on eBay, you can grab one for a cool $50k-$75k. Did we miss anything or have a story we should include next week? Let us know on Twitter!"

I festeggiamenti sono iniziati tra le proteste di alcuni attivisti, con minacce da parte della comunità di boicottare i festeggiamenti del magnate e cambiamenti dell'ultimo minuto dovuti a problemi di sicurezza. Tanti i personaggi Vip tra gli invitati; i primi a sbarcare in Laguna sono stati: Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian con la sorella Khloè e la madre Kris Jenner, Tom Brady, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Ivanka Trump e suo marito Jared Kushner. Si attendono nelle prossime ore: Jay-Z e Beyoncé, Mick Jagger, Katy Perry, la cantante Jewel e Karlie Kloss con il marito Joshua Kushner. Pare che tra gli invitati figuri anche Tony Gonzalez, ex giocatore della NFL ed ex compagno della Sanchez, con cui ha un figlio. Perché a Venezia protestano contro il matrimonio di Jeff Bezos Alcuni residenti di Venezia, stanchi del turismo eccessivo che da anni sta mettendo a dura prova le infrastrutture e i servizi della città, sono scesi in piazza per protestare contro il matrimonio di Jeff Bezos e Lauren Sanchez. Sostengono che un evento di questa portata non faccia altro che aggravare i problemi causati dall'afflusso di visitatori. I manifestanti stanno promuovendo la campagna ""No Space for Bezos"", che ha già tappezzato la città di striscioni e adesivi. Federica Toninelli, attivista veneziana del gruppo, ha dichiarato a Reuters che il matrimonio rappresenta ""un simbolo dello sfruttamento della città da parte di chi viene da fuori"". I 27 abiti da sposa della moglie di Jeff Bezos Secondo le indiscrezioni, la sposa Lauren Sanchez indosserà ben 27 abiti da sposa nei tre giorni di festeggiamenti. per un costo totale di circa un milione e mezzo di euro. Tra le varie creazioni dovrebbero esserci anche una di Dior e un'altra di Dolce & Gabbana.  Invece di regali, Bezos e Sanchez hanno chiesto donazioni a cause sociali e ambientali. Gli ospiti riceveranno bomboniere di lusso, che includono prodotti di design italiano e dolci artigianali di Rosa Salva. Il matrimonio, organizzato dalla società di eventi Lanza e Baucina, promette di essere uno spettacolo di stile e raffinatezza, segnando una pietra miliare nel mondo dei matrimoni delle celebrità. © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATATutte le news di Attualita'"

mov_C760CADF1C227958DF0CE90F584E71C3,2025-06-26 14:02:12,en,WEB,"  Scattered Spider continues to dominate the headlines, with the latest news linking the hackers to attacks on U.S. insurance giant Aflac, Philadelphia Insurance Companies, and Erie Insurance, disclosed through SEC Form 8-K filings which indicate the theft of sensitive customer data and operational disruption. This comes at the same time that Google Threat Intelligence Group shared that it “is now aware of multiple intrusions in the U.S. which bear the hallmarks of Scattered Spider activity”, specifically impacting the insurance industry. But what exactly does this mean? To answer this, let's quickly recap how we got here and what a Scattered Spider attack looks like. How did we get here? The criminal collective tracked by analysts as Scattered Spider has been active since 2022 and have been linked to a range of high-profile breaches, for example the attacks on Caesars and MGM Resorts in 2023, and Transport for London in 2024. Caesars: hackers impersonated an IT user and convinced an outsourced help desk to reset credentials, after which the attacker stole the customer loyalty program database and secured a $15m ransom payment. MGM Resorts: hackers used LinkedIn information to impersonate an employee and reset the employee's credentials, resulting in a 6TB data theft. After MGM refused to pay, the attack eventually resulted in a 36-hour outage, a $100m hit, and a class-action lawsuit settled for $45m. Transport for London: resulted in 5,000 users' bank details exposed, 30,000 staff required to attend in-person appointments to verify their identities and reset passwords, and significant disruption to online services lasting for months. The calling card in these attacks was the abuse of help desk processes to reset passwords and/or MFA factors used to access an account. The attacker simply calls up the help desk with enough information to impersonate an employee, asks them to send an MFA enrollment link for their new mobile device, and can then utilize self-service password reset functionality to take control of the account. Scarily simple. Scattered Spider has dominated the news in recent weeks following high-profile breaches impacting UK retailers. But with a long history of high-profile ransomware attacks, this is just one example of their identity-based approach. Join Push Security as they go beyond the breaches and learn how to defend your organization against Scattered Spider's growing arsenal of TTPs. Watch the webinar on-demand Scattered Spider's resurgence in 2025 This technique was reprised in a series of high-profile attacks in 2025, with major breaches of UK retailers Marks and Spencer and Co-op dominating the headlines. Both resulted in the loss of sensitive data and prolonged disruption to in-store and digital services, with M&S feeling the pain of £300m in lost profits and a share value hit approaching £1b, and a multimillion-pound class action lawsuit and possible ICO fines looming. A series of attacks against retailers worldwide soon followed, at an unprecedented rate. Dior, The North Face, Cartier, Victoria's Secret, Adidas, Coca-Cola, and United Natural Foods were among the retailers to suffer a breach between May-June 2025. Unlike the mass Snowflake breaches in 2024 (which targeted a single platform used by many organizations), these attacks are notable in that they are seemingly unrelated — they simply represent a concerted effort by attackers to target the retail sector. Less details have been provided about these attacks compared to the M&S and Co-op breaches, but a number of them specifically point to the use of identity-based techniques as opposed to more traditional software exploits — another hallmark of Scattered Spider. This leads us to our first key takeaway… Takeaway #1: Identity-based TTPs are the new normal Scattered Spider's attacks are the latest in a growing number of identity-based breaches. When we look back at Scattered Spider's TTP evolution, we can see that they have consistently exploited identity-based weaknesses in order to gain access to victim environments. Scattered Spider initial access vectors in public breaches where the attack vector was disclosed. Source: Push Security. Taking a step back, it's worth thinking about how help desk scams fit into the wider toolkit of tactics, techniques and procedures (TTPs) used by threat actors like Scattered Spider. Scattered Spider has heavily relied on identity-based TTPs since they first emerged in 2022, following a repeatable path of bypassing MFA, achieving account takeover on privileged accounts, stealing data from cloud services, and deploying ransomware (principally in VMware environments). TTPs used by Scattered Spider include: Credential phishing via email and SMS (smishing) to harvest passwords en masse Using SIM swapping (where you get the carrier to transfer a number to your attacker-controlled SIM card) to bypass SMS-based MFA Using MFA fatigue (aka. push bombing) to bypass app-based push authentication Using vishing (i.e. directly calling a victim to social engineer their MFA code, as opposed to a help desk attack) Social engineering domain registrars to take control of the target organization's DNS, hijacking their MX records and inbound mail, and using this to take over the company's business app environments And latterly, using MFA-bypass AiTM phishing kits like Evilginx to steal live user sessions So, help desk scams are an important part of their toolkit, but it's not the whole picture. Methods like AiTM phishing in particular have spiked in popularity this year as a reliable and scalable way of bypassing MFA and achieving account takeover. It's important not to think about these techniques as just a Scattered Spider trait either. After all, Scattered Spider is not a self-identified group — it's a name given by analysts to patterns of activity. Given the series of arrests in 2024, it's unlikely that the current incarnation of Scattered Spider is the same individuals behind the attacks in 2022-2024. And these identity-based attack patterns are shared across various self-named criminal groups like, Lapsus$, Yanluowang, Karakurt, and ShinyHunters. Even Russian state-sponsored actors are increasingly using the kinds of techniques popularised by criminal groups. Simply, identity-based techniques are the new normal for attackers in 2025. Takeaway #2: Help desk scams aren't new, but they're here to stay As we established earlier, help desk scams are nothing new (we saw them in the Caesars, MGM Resorts, and Transport for London breaches to name a few)...."

El fundador de Amazon y la ex periodista y piloto estadounidense celebrarán su unión en una ceremonia que promete ser tan lujosa como privada, con una lista de asistentes cuidadosamente elegida y una logística sin precedentes. Entre los detalles más comentados, destaca la participación musical de dos leyendas: Elton John y Lady Gaga, quienes ofrecerán un show exclusivo para los novios y sus 200 invitados. Es posible que los novios elijan abrir la pista de baile con algunas de las canciones más románticas de Elton John, como Tiny Dancer, Your Song o Can You Feel the Love Tonight. Si el icónico músico llegara a presentarse en la boda del fundador de Amazon y la reconocida conductora de televisión, sin duda sería un momento muy emotivo, especialmente considerando los recientes problemas de salud que ha atravesado. Lady Gaga y Elton John (Shutterstock) En diciembre de 2024, el artista, de 78 años, compartió con sus seguidores que sufrió una considerable pérdida de visión en su ojo derecho debido a una infección ocular contraída durante el verano. Lamentablemente, su recuperación ha sido lenta y el daño ha comenzado a afectar también su ojo izquierdo. La celebración se llevará a cabo del 26 al 29 de junio en distintos puntos de Venecia, incluyendo la isla de San Giorgio Maggiore, la Scuola Grande della Misericordia y el yate Koru, propiedad de Bezos y valuado en 500 millones de dólares. Los detalles de la boda de Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sanchez El costo estimado del evento oscila entre los 10 y los 30 millones de dólares, con un gasto promedio de 50,000 dólares por asistente. Se han reservado cinco de los hoteles más exclusivos de la ciudad, como el Aman Venice, el Gritti Palace y el St. Regis, además de contratar más de 60 taxis acuáticos y góndolas privadas para el traslado de los asistentes. En la lista de invitados destacan celebridades como Oprah Winfrey, Beyoncé, George Clooney, Kim Kardashian, Tom Cruise, Ivanka Trump y Jared Kushner. Aunque no se ha confirmado oficialmente quiénes serán los padrinos, se especula que amigos cercanos como Anna Wintour o el productor Brian Grazer podrían asumir ese rol simbólico.

(AFP) Lauren Sánchez usará un vestido exclusivo de Oscar de la Renta, pero se ha dado a conocer que tendrá hasta 27 cambios de ropa durante los tres días del festejo. La periodista ha trabajado con firmas como Dolce & Gabbana, Dior y Schiaparelli para crear un repertorio de alta moda que refleje su estilo atrevido y elegante. Jeff Bezos, por su parte, llevará un traje hecho a medida, posiblemente de Ralph Lauren o de alguna sastrería de Savile Row."

mov_D337EA564008E6897569A69BD6CB3E12,2025-06-26 15:00:00,en,WEB,"  It's been a really great year for TV and film so far—ahem, Adolescence, The White Lotus, Sinners, Materialists, and Overcompensating—but it also feels like things are just starting to heat up, figuratively and literally speaking. (These rising temps are no joke!) The Bear is back, we have the final season of The Summer I Turned Pretty just around the corner (we're not crying—you're crying), a sweeping new Outlander series is landing in August, and major blockbusters, like Jurassic World Rebirth, The Fantastic Four: First Steps, and Superman, are hitting theaters soon. Our entertainment dance card is filling up quickly—not that we're complaining. The best part about all these offerings is that they are also introducing us to a slew of compelling performances, which means we are due for another installment of our Ones to Watch portfolio. We've culled through the summer slate to bring you six standout actresses, from rising comedy stars to international breakouts, to have on your radar right now, plus their seasonal fashion picks. Read on to meet the women we can't stop raving about. WHO: Mary Beth Barone WHAT: If you've watched the hilarious Prime Video series Overcompensating or are a regular listener of the podcast Ride, then this one needs no explanation. Mary Beth Barone is that girl. Truthfully, we've been following the comedian since she was the deadpan darling of NYC's comedy scene helping men and women get rid of their F-boy tendencies with her popular showcase Drag His Ass, and her appreciation for creating a major fashion moment onstage—like when she wore an archival Versace dress for her comedy special Thought Provoking—is not lost on us. Together with creative partner Benito Skinner, Barone has been delivering some serious comedy magic lately. Overcompensating, Skinner's semi-autobiographical coming-of-age and coming-out college comedy, is a 10 out of 10, and Barone flexes her acting chops and signature dry humor as Grace, the protagonist's bitchy older sister and reigning cool girl of school. With the recent season 3 of Ride, she and Skinner muse on everything from Labubus to bald guys. Barone is seemingly everywhere in our world right now, and we're here for it. You and Benito Skinner have done comedy tours together, host a podcast together, and now star in Overcompensating together. What makes Skinner a great creative partner for you? Benito is the most magnetic person I have ever met. Having a creative partner I am genuinely excited to see and spend time with and laugh with is such a gift. I also think we are very different and challenge each other creatively. He's pushed me to places as a performer I never thought I could go, and I pushed him to explain ""Grandpa Terry"" to our podcast listeners. When Skinner came to you about playing Grace in the show, what was your first reaction? I don't think we have an English word for it. The French probably do. What is a memory from filming Overcompensating that lives rent-free in your head? Benny, Grace, and Peter outside the liquor store in the first episode. It was one of the audition scenes and the first scene I got to film with Benny. I just couldn't believe we were actually there, together, making a television show. It was exactly as I had imagined and then somehow better. Who have you been most excited to see slide into your DMs to share that they are a fan of the show? My ex-boyfriend's sisters. I miss them! What is an invaluable lesson you learned doing stand-up comedy? Mental illness can manifest in many, many different ways, and some of those ways can be really beautiful. You are someone who has a real appreciation for fashion. What has been a particularly special look you've worn recently, and why? I got to wear this incredible Roberto Cavalli dress to the Gotham Awards a few weeks ago. I love the silhouette and the sexy cutouts. My stylist Kat Typaldos really understands me, and I feel lucky I get to work with her. Wearing Joker glam (done by Alexandra French) with a hyper-femme white Cavalli dress was very special. Fashion should be fun! I just thought of that. What are your summer '25 fashion essentials? Christian Dior Diorissimo Saddle Pochette Bag ""'Shoes always fit,' Toni Collette [said in] In Her Shoes (2005). I feel this way about bags. When my clothes aren't inspiring me, I throw my Carmex, AirPods, keys, phone, and wallet into a c*nty bag. The bag can make the outfit. I like to buy on The RealReal and give a preowned bag 'a life of scandal and passion and getting screwed in an alleyway by a billionaire while his frigid wife waits in the limo thinking that he just went back into the bar to get his cell phone,' [to quote] Cameron Diaz (In Her Shoes, 2005).""..."

Il matrimonio a Venezia di Jeff Bezos e Lauren Sanchez sta calamitando l'attenzione dei media mondiali per lo sfarzo ma anche per le polemiche legate all'”affitto” della città in gran parte blindata, in questi giorni, per consentire al magnate di Amazon e ai suoi illustri ospiti di muoversi in sicurezza e con la garanzia della privacy. Tra le tante curiosità sul matrimonio, pari a quello di una coppia reale, c'è quello che riguarda il guardaroba della futura signora Bezos e in particolare l'abito da sposa. Pare che Lauren Sanchez abbia portato con se a Venezia qualcosa come 27 abiti, rigorosamente griffati a cominciare da Dolce & Gabbana e Dior. Per la cena pre wedding nell'isola di San Giovanni Evangelista, la futura sposa è apparsa per pochi minuti, all'uscita dell'Hotel Aman dove sta alloggiando, con un abito vintage di Alexander McQueen, un vestito monospalla blu con righe di paillettes. L'attesa più grande è per la giornata di domani: cosa indosserà la sposa? Non è da escludere che opterà per Oscar de La Renta ma anche i pizzi e i bustier di Dolce & Gabbana potrebbero averla tentata parecchio. Ovviamente non è un problema di costi. La spesa complessiva per gli abiti di Miss Amazon si aggirerebbe intorno al milione e mezzo di euro. 27 cambi d'abito, tra i marchi privilegiati Dolce & Gabbana e Dior, ma per il vestito con cui pronuncerà il “sì” si scommette su Oscar de la Renta.

mov_D233065F35688C214BF5373CB8348CC6,2025-06-26 19:13:35,ru,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[ru]Сан-Джованни Эванжелиста — крошечный и малоизвестный остров в венецианской лагуне, который иногда соединяется с соседним островом Торчелло песчаными отмелями. Здесь практически не бывает туристов — постоянных жителей всего один дом и 11 человек, проживающих на острове. Это бывший гостевой дом при разрушенном монастыре, сохранившийся со времен, когда в этих местах располагался крупный религиозный комплекс. Но это уединённое место превратится в эпицентр светского события — гала-ужина в честь предстоящей свадьбы основателя Amazon Джеффа Безоса и Лорен Санчес, сообщает Daily Mail. На мероприятие приглашены около 200 высокопоставленных гостей — среди них такие знаменитости и бизнес-иконы, как Ким Кардашьян с матерью Крис Дженнер, медиамагнат Барри Диллер с женой Дианой фон Фюрстенберг, а также множество других миллиардеров и миллионеров. Их доставят на остров катерами, ведь добираться сюда из центра Венеции, с Гранд-канала, займет около получаса. Лорен Санчес, по предварительным данным, прилетит на вертолёте, приземлившись на плавучей площадке вспомогательного судна Abeona — части флота, поддерживающего мега-яхту Koru. Для гостей организована охрана «президентского уровня». Главное место торжества — вилла Баслини, отреставрированное в 1950-х годах здание с пятью спальнями. Это историческое поместье является элитной арендной недвижимостью, забронированной на ближайшие два года. Известно, что именно эта вилла вдохновила Эрнеста Хемингуэя на написание романа «Через реку и в леса». Организаторы свадьбы — компания Lanza & Baucina, основанная в Лондоне, — буквально в последний момент обеспечили аренду этого уникального места. По словам знакомого с организацией события свадебного планировщика, выбор острова — «очень мудрое и оригинальное решение», далёкое от банальных шаблонов. Планы свадьбы пришлось корректировать из-за обострения военной ситуации на Ближнем Востоке и связанных с ней мер безопасности. Первоначально центральным местом торжества должна была стать яхта Безоса Koru стоимостью 500 миллионов долларов. Однако в связи с протестами против роскошного мероприятия («No Space For Bezos») и опасениями по безопасности, яхту оставили у побережья хорватского острова Крес. Сейчас яхта Koru не задействована в торжествах и будет оставаться на якоре в Хорватии, а часть гостей и Безос с семьёй проводят время на вспомогательной яхте Abeona. Главные события свадебных торжеств День 1 — Гала-ужин (четверг, остров Сан-Джованни Эванжелиста) Собравшиеся за длинными столами виноградников наслаждаются ужином на фоне лагуны. Мероприятие окружено строжайшей охраной и максимально бережным отношением к окружающей среде. День 2 — Свадебная церемония (пятница, остров Сан-Джорджо Маджоре) Церемония пройдет в открытом амфитеатре «Зелёный театр» — недавно обновлённом компанией Foster + Partners. Амфитеатр вмещает до 1500 гостей и украшен белым камнем из Виченцы, окружён живой изгородью. После церемонии запланирован ужин на свежем воздухе или в исторических залах острова. По окончании будут фейерверки. Предполагается, что к мероприятию может присоединиться редактор Vogue Анна Винтур, хотя в это же время в Париже проходит дебютный показ нового креативного директора Dior Джонатана Андерсона. Свадебное платье невесты — от Dolce & Gabbana, выбранное ею по личным предпочтениям и с одобрением Винтур. В последующие дни Санчес сменит несколько образов, в том числе наряды Oscar de la Renta. День 3 — Бал (суббота, Арсенале) Бал пройдет в Арсенале — исторической верфи Венеции. Это большое, закрытое и охраняемое пространство с единственным входом. В прошлом здесь проходили крупные арт-выставки и благотворительные мероприятия amfAR. В Арсенале есть огромные залы, которые можно преобразовать в роскошные вечерние площадки, что делает это место удобным для масштабного и приватного праздника. Дополнительные мероприятия Помимо основных торжеств, в Венеции и на других маленьких островах лагуны, таких как Сакка Сессола, Бурано и Джудекка, а также на арендованных яхтах пройдут частные вечеринки и экскурсии. Гости получат возможность посетить музеи, включая знаменитые коллекции Пегги Гуггенхайм и Пино при Палаццо Грасси. Планы после свадьбы После венчания яхта Koru направится в Таормину на Сицилии — место, которое Безос и Санчес полюбили во время прошлогоднего путешествия. Там они остановятся в известном отеле Four Seasons San Domenico Palace, где снимали второй сезон сериала The White Lotus. Ожидается, что молодожёны сделают крупные пожертвования в венецианские благотворительные организации, однако официальные заявления будут сделаны уже после окончания свадьбы — чтобы избежать впечатления «покупки» города."

La subasta, que rinde un homenaje a la realeza, contaba con 327 lotes, de los cuales 140 eran objetos personales de la princesa Diana junio 26, 2025 El icónico vestido de seda azul con estampado floral de Bellville Sassoon, conocido como el “vestido solidario” de la princesa Diana, fue subastado por primera vez este jueves por la casa Julien's, alcanzando los 520 mil dólares. Lo usó en al menos nueve ocasiones. Lo llevó en Australia, España, en África y en numerosos hospitales. A los niños les encantaban los colores y la viveza del diseño, podían abrazarla y sentirse atraídos por ella, sin sentirse intimidados por la princesa”, cuenta en una entrevista con EFE Martin Nolan, cofundador y director ejecutivo de Julien's Auctions. El precio alcanzado por esta pieza superó las expectativas de los organizadores, quienes estimaban que su valor rondaba los 200 mil y 300 mil dólares.

Por su parte, dos de las piezas más destacadas de la subasta, el bolso Lady Dior negro de piel que Diana llevó durante su visita oficial a Argentina ese mismo año y un traje de esquí fucsia con el que fue fotografiada en múltiples ocasiones entre 1985 y 1992, se vendieron cada uno por 325 dólares. El bolso superó por amplio margen su valor estimado, que oscilaba entre 20 mil y 30 mil dólares, mientras que el conjunto de esquí duplicó con creces su estimación inicial de 30 mil a 50 mil dólares. El traje de esquí y el bolso Lady Dior son dos piezas que pensé que nunca veríamos en una subasta. Ella compró el traje directamente en tienda, lo usó para esquiar con su esposo o con sus hijos pequeños en Liechtenstein, Austria y Suiza. Solía repetir sus atuendos una y otra vez, así que, en mi opinión, es una pieza realmente especial”, cuenta Nolan. La subasta, titulada 'Princess Diana's Style & A Royal Collection', contaba con 327 lotes, de los cuales 140 eran objetos personales de Lady Di, que rinden homenaje al estilo de la figura más icónica de la realeza.

Foto de EFE. Ella no seguía un manual de reglas. Seguía su corazón y lo que consideraba correcto. Era amable, cariñosa, compasiva y considerada… Pero Diana es un ícono de estilo”, asegura Nolan. El resto de la subasta incluía piezas relacionadas con otros miembros de la realeza británica, como el rey Carlos III y la reina Camila, la reina Isabel II, los duques de Windsor y la princesa Margarita. Otras de las piezas más codiciadas eran el sombrero estilo arquero de paja rosa durazno de John Boyd, que alcanzó una suma de 26 mil dólares, un vestido negro de cóctel de Catherine Walker vendido en 260 mil dólares u otro azul cielo diseñado por Gianni Versace subastado por 227 mil 500. Mientras que un conjunto de seda de dos piezas, amarillo con estampado floral y diseñado por Bruce Oldfield, alcanzó la suma de 260 mil dólares. La princesa fue fotografiada con este atuendo en 1987 durante su asistencia al Royal Ascot.

The famed editor-in-chief, who's served at the helm of American Vogue since 1988, is stepping down as the magazine's head of editorial content, as part of a modified organizational structure the Condé Nast publication adopted four years ago. Wintour will stay on as Condé Nast's chief content officer and Vogue's global editorial director. Wintour, known for her stern management style and iconic A-frame bob, helped redefine the landscape of celebrity fashion, thanks in part to her bold cover portraits for Vogue (Wintour's first issue featured Israeli model Michaela Bercu in a casual look that included a $50 pair of faded jeans.) Over the years, Wintour spotlighted a range of A-list talent, from pop stars Madonna and Britney Spears to supermodel Naomi Campbell and former first lady Michelle Obama. The style maven also helped transform the Met Gala, an haute couture fundraiser for The Metropolitan Museum of Art, into a viral, star-studded extravaganza that draws buzz from fashionistas, celebrities and social media onlookers alike. Here's a look back at Wintour's indelible mark on the fashion world and beyond.

""It was the flashiest and most shocking party the Met had ever thrown,"" fashion journalist and author Amy Odell wrote in 2022's ""Anna: The Biography."" Wintour had ""cracked off the shellac and unleashed the future's much more hip possibilities."" It's no secret that Wintour has a heavy hand in curating the gala's details, as previously cataloged in 2016's ""The First Monday in May"" documentary. Wintour, along with museum curators and close friend Tom Ford, orchestrates every detail, including the dress code, food and seating arrangements. In recent years, the Met Gala has hosted epic fashion moments from the likes of Rihanna, Kim Kardashian, Zendaya, Jared Leto and Bad Bunny with head-turning themes that explore multiculturalism, nature and fashion history. Even with all the celebrity wattage, West Coast Vogue contributor Lisa Love detailed to Odell some of the intricacies Anna would ""fuss about"" during the event. ""When Kim Kardashian wore a custom latex Thierry Mugler dress that redefined tight to the camp themed party in 2019, Anna kept saying to Lisa Love, 'Can you please tell her to sit down?'"" Odell wrote. ""Love had to explain that, actually Kardashian physically couldn't sit."" Who is Anna Wintour?

Porque aunque la belleza entre por los ojos, lo que en el fondo enamora es la verdad que desprende. La de Quim Gutiérrez (Barcelona, 1981) tiene varias dimensiones, a cuál más sugestiva: desde su amor por los bosques a la pasión por el arte, la fotografía artesana, la luz de Barcelona, la música en clave de alta fidelidad, los libros con miga, el mar aunque no se bañe, la moda sublime, la metafísica, la trascendencia, el arte sincero de la interpretación... Puede que todo este saber, con sus dudas e ignorancias, sea la clave de la personalidad de un actor que atrae al primer vistazo, cuyos trabajos –desde su Goya por AzulOscuroCasiNegro (2006) a Primos (2011), Ventajas de viajar en tren (2019), Historias para no contar (2022), El cuerpo en llamas (2023) o las recientes Un funeral de locos y Los aitas, en cartel– son parte de nuestra vida. Y puede que también sea por ese brillo que libera por lo que las mejores firmas de moda también reclaman su presencia. Hoy intentamos descubrir las emociones de las que está hecho, la Barcelona en la que nació y le hace ser y el porqué ser barcelonés tiene una impronta indeleble fácil de reconocer y envidiar. Mientras, él baila vestido de Dior Men en este reportaje donde cuesta poner el punto final. Naciste hace 44 años en Barcelona. ¿Cómo recuerdas la ciudad y el barrio donde creciste? Tengo sensaciones soleadas, cómodas y ligadas a mi infancia. Recuerdo Barcelona como una ciudad plácida porque me quisieron mucho y tuve un hermano al año y medio de yo nacer. Creo que al principio tuve celos [risas], pero las imágenes que me vienen son positivas, agradables. Vivíamos en el barrio de Vallcarca, en la parte de arriba, muy cerca de la Collserola, de la montaña. Yo iba al colegio andando. Ahí toca bastante el sol y el clima es templado. También recuerdo que donde vivía había muchos portales donde esconderse y yo me escondía mucho [risas]. Los primeros juegos de ficción fueron en esos portales hasta que mi madre me dijo un día que, con diez años, debía tener un comportamiento más relajado, aunque siguiera siendo fantasioso. Recuerdo esa con­versación sin frustración, aceptando que estaba creciendo y que tenía que poner en otro lado la ficción. Lo que no sabía entonces es que esa ficción se iba a convertir en profesión. ¿Y cómo creció la Barcelona de tu adolescencia? Entonces la ciudad se me abrió, cambié el colegio por el Instituto Montserrat. También iba andando, pero volvía en autobús. Con esa edad, trece o catorce años, empecé a salir por el barrio con los compañeros. En esos años no tenía nada con qué comparar Barcelona, pero me parecía una ciudad accesible, cómoda, segura… Con unos años más empezamos a bajar al centro y, a pesar de algunas advertencias, nunca tuvimos un susto, ni un atraco. Barcelona en los años 90 era una ciudad segura. ¿Cuál es ese rincón mágico en el que viviste un momento especial? No es un recuerdo romántico, sino el sitio donde me tomaba las primeras cervezas con mis colegas. Se llamaba Si De Pas, ya está cerrado. Quedábamos en la estación de metro de Fontana e íbamos andando por el barrio de Gràcia. Todas esas calles me producen sensaciones impregnadas por la adolescencia: historias de amor, rencillas, pequeños conflictos con compañeros de otros cursos… Todo muy intenso, estuviera la ciudad gris, lluviosa, soleada o con los cielos negros. Y cuando había estrellas, tintineaban maravillosamente. ¿Cuál fue la primera película que viste en tu vida y en qué cine? Recuerdo hacer cola para ver Las tortugas Ninja [1990] con mi tía Carmen y mi hermano. Y luego, años después, no se me olvida Lost in Translation [2003] en los Cines Verdi. Me quedé muy flipado con la película y con la experiencia cinematográfica. Los Verdi son un tesoro para cualquier cinéfilo que viva en Barcelona. El circuito de cines y teatros de Barcelona siempre ha tenido un estatus de prestigio y calidad. ¿En cuáles de ellos has vivido grandes momentos ya como actor? Me estrené en el Teatro Lliure de Gràcia junto a la actriz Marta Marco, con la obra Some Explícit Polaroids. Creo que fue en 2000. Para mí aquello fue épico, porque todos los Lliure tienen un halo especial. Ahora voy poco porque vivo en Madrid y, cuando voy a Barcelona, veo a la familia. Y los Verdi son para mí unos cines muy especiales. Presentar allí AzulOscuroCasiNegro como protagonista, después de haber visto como espectador tantas películas, fue un recorrido circular muy emotivo. Tu padre es catedrático de Fisiología Animal en la UB y tu madre, profesora en Escola Sadako, una escuela con un modelo pedagógico especial. ¿Cómo te educaron? Sí, es un sistema educativo muy avanzado en el que se trabaja por proyectos. Yo he colaborado con ellos en talleres de cine e interpretación. Es un modelo muy interesante. Entonces ya tenía un proyecto moderno para el momento, pero ahora han ido más allá y es una gozada ver lo que hacen...."

Шансы западных компаний стать успешными на рынке электронной торговли в России после возвращения невелики, потому что отечественные игроки создали им большую конкуренцию, заявил в интервью РИА Новости глава глава Ассоциации компаний интернет-торговли (АКИТ) Артем Соколов. ""С учетом многообразия форматов российского e-commerce, того ассортимента, который уже представлен, коммерческих коллабораций, инфраструктуры, шансы у зарубежных компаний на большую долю присутствия на нашем рынке невелики. Однако, как бы не сложилось — от конкуренции выиграет именно российский покупатель. За прошедшее время они создали очень серьезную конкуренцию зарубежным компаниям"", - сказал Соколов. Он отметил, что сейчас пользователи могут найти на отечественных площадках любой товар, тогда как несколько лет назад им приходилось обращаться к зарубежным платформам. ""Более того, если нужного товара не окажется в моменте, можно договориться, чтобы его привезли. Все это делает наш интернет-канал еще более привлекательным для клиентов"", - уточнил президент АКИТ. Сейчас российские предприниматели фокусируются на развитии отношений с странами Евразийского союза, а также с Индией, Китаем, Узбекистаном и рядом других стран. ""Сотрудничество российского e-commerce с западными компаниями сейчас будет больше интересом с их стороны, а не с нашей. Трудно прогнозировать, что произойдет после снятия санкций, но очевидно, что сегодняшняя достаточно высокая конкуренция на рынке станет еще выше в случае возвращения брендов"", - добавил Соколов. В России в 2022 году перестали работать интернет-магазины западных брендов (в частности Zara, Dior, IKEA и другие), а также платформы электронной коммерции, такие, как Amazon. Власти РФ неоднократно заявляли, что привилегий и преференций для возвращающихся в РФ западных компаний не будет, они должны будут возвращаться на конкурентной основе. Так, президент РФ Владимир Путин в конце марта поручил правительству актуализировать перечень ушедших из России компаний и разработать процедуру согласования их возвращения с обязательными гарантиями добросовестного и ответственного ведения дел. А первый вице-премьер РФ Денис Мантуров ранее говорил, что российские власти будут допускать на отечественный рынок только те иностранные компании, в которых заинтересована страна, пристально рассматривая каждый случай в отдельности. При отсутствии у иностранных компаний, которые захотят вернуться на российский рынок, подписанных опционов на обратный выкуп, игра будет с ""чистого поля"", указывал он.

mov_B8094A3F7B15CD0B6A86B4F11013187C,2025-06-27 04:07:35,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]Si sa, sono i dettagli a fare la differenza, nella vita così come per quanto concerne il capitolo moda. A tal proposito, borse e scarpe non sono i soli accessori in grado di fare la netta differenza nella riuscita di una mise: con l'arrivo della calda stagione l'attenzione è puntata sugli occhiali da sole, glamour e magnetici come mai prima. Occhiali da sole di tendenza, quali aggiungere alla propria collezione per l'estate 2025 In veste di accessorio di punta d'ogni estate, gli occhiali da sole costituiscono un vero e proprio investimento per il grande vanto di saper unire l'utile al dilettevole: mentre assolvono il nobile compito di salvaguardare la vista, come nient'altro sanno completare la mise di turno aggiungendovi personalità extra e donando contemporaneamente al volto una luce – o un'ombra, dovremmo dire forse – tutta nuova. Inforcarne un paio, possibilmente quello giusto, chiude e definisce qualsivoglia look estivo in quella che si definisce una tacita dichiarazione di stile a tutti gli effetti, insomma. Vi è chi resta fedele ad un unico modello per tutta la vita e chi, per contro e indole, insegue entusiasticamente l'incalzante ritmo delle tendenze di anno in anno sino ad accumulare una vera collezione, una completa di un modello specifico per ogni evenienza. Quello perfetto può chiudere il look, riprendendone il mood generale, oppure spezzarlo e conferire al tutto nuova grinta: non esiste una legge modaiola universale in merito. Esistono però dei nuovi dettami, e sono pronti ad apportare alla cabina armadio un tocco di stile davvero inedito a chi è pronto a fargli un po' di spazio. Dopotutto, anche un solo angolo è sufficiente. Come al solito, scrupolosissime sono state le passerelle dedicate all'odierna primavera/estate ad alzare il sipario sulle silhouette e i design destinati a dettare tendenza. In metallo, in acetato, coloratissimi, classici, essenziali e sottili oppure maxi e addirittura esasperati, gli occhiali da sole dell'estate 2025 hanno una soluzione per ogni fashion addicted: si spazia dai tagli lineari e minimalisti, a cavallo dell'onda del grande revival anni Novanta, per approdare sino alle montature tondeggianti e in tonalità sgargianti tipicamente anni Settanta. Non mancano certo gli evergreen, primi su tutti gli iconici aviator e quelli squadrati. Per gli amanti dello street style più audace, invece, il modello su cui puntare tutto è sicuramente quello dal piglio futurista a mascherina, anche specchiato. Ma come scegliere, come destreggiarsi in mezzo a una così ampia varietà di opzioni? Niente paura, siamo qui per questo: ecco svelati di seguito i 5 occhiali da sole che secondo gli esperti del settore meritano senz'altro di catalizzare l'attenzione generale nei prossimi caldissimi mesi. Occhiali da sole anni Settanta Abituati dalla moda a lasciarci trascinare inermi dall'onda della più travolgente nostalgia, non è certo stata una sorpresa come il decennio sinonimo di hippies e stile boho sia tornato a 2025 appena iniziato a dettare tendenza. E sì, ovviamente anche in fatto di occhiali da sole. Alla guida del trend Chloé, poco casualmente, con le sue scenografiche montature anni Settanta, esagerate e in versione XXL, stondate come al tempo oppure contraddistinte da forme squadrate e angoli pronunciati. Subito a seguire Miu Miu, con controproposte nel segno della stravaganza più ostentata, e Pucci attraverso modelli variopinti. Maggiormente conformi alla normale quotidianità le alternative fornite alle fashion victim da Tom Ford e Tiffany & Co., con il motivo tartaruga il primo e in nero e con dettagli dorati il secondo. Occhiali da sole Aviator Nel ruolo di grande classico intramontabile, gli occhiali da sole Aviator non possono che tornare a regnare incontrastati sul panorama moda estivo ad ogni primo, vago accenno di caldo. Perfetti per addizionare un tocco di carattere ad ogni genere di look, li troviamo quest'anno anche in variante light e dunque distinguibili da quelli del passato per una montatura più leggera e sottile. In alternativa, al posto dei tipici modelli in argento oppure in oro, si può optare per una montatura più spessa e audace come quella di The Attico, dotata di lenti oversize gettonatissime in nuances chiare. Alcune proposte avvolgono abbondantemente il viso, creando un design che si pone a metà strada tra il tradizionale aviatore e la mascherina. Tra le fan del genere abbiamo Chiara Ferragni. Occhiali da sole specchiati In perfetto equilibrio tra i più colorati modelli dall'animo sportivo e le declinazioni dall'ingombrante spirito avanguardistico, gli occhiali da sole più cool in circolazione presentano lucidissime lenti a specchio argentate, in cui si dice sia persino possibile perdersi. Fendi li ha proposti sottili e sofisticati, Prada sotto forma di mascherine compatte e dalla forma allungata che paiono arrivare direttamente dal futuro. Loewe, ancora, ha apposto il cristallo specchiato alla tipica montatura aviator a goccia, ma questa volta dalla forma esagerata, e Ray-Ban ha fatto la sua controproposta in una elegantissima silhouette ovale. Occhiali da sole a mascherina Come direttamente usciti dal mondo dello sport, si sono visti approdare in passerella vistosi quanto adrenalinici occhiali da sole a mascherina: c'è chi li usa per andare in bici, chi in barca, chi per sciare, chi, come Jennifer Lopez, per personalizzare gli outfit di tutti i giorni o quasi. Sgargianti, inaspettatamente leggeri e dall'accattivante design futuristico, con lenti rigorosamente polarizzate, sono proprio loro l'accessorio alternativo e di tendenza da sfoggiare con orgoglio da qui a fine settembre. A dire la propria in pedana sono stati Prada, Roberto Cavalli, Oakley, in prototipi coloratissimi, ma anche Moschino. Occhiali da sole squadrati Tra gli occhiali da sole più ambiti della calda stagione al suo preludio spiccano, senza ombra di dubbio, tutte quelle affascinanti versioni dalla forma rettangolare. Densi d'un aura magnetica e misteriosa, parliamo di accessori dalle linee rigorose e ben definite, spesso contraddistinguibili per lenti total-black, e dunque a copertura estrema, a regalare a chiunque li indossi l'allure della vera diva. Chiedere a Daisy Edgar-Jones per ulteriori informazioni. Sempre contemporanei e sofisticati ad ogni uscita, d'effetto e senza troppi fronzoli, sono stati puntualmente trascinati in passerella da Yves Saint Laurent, Fendi, Dolce&Gabbana e persino da Ray-Ban, con il modello iconico Wayfarer, la scelta ideale quando si desidera dare quel tanto in voga tocco mannish al look. Dior Eyewear, poi, ne ha firmato una modello dall'attrattiva evergreen, mentre Port Tanger ha aggiunto una inedita sfumatura ambrata ai suoi.

mov_1806C4600332136A0E0F20AE2913E703,2025-06-27 07:06:05,ru,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[ru]Сан-Джованни Эванжелиста — крошечный и малоизвестный остров в венецианской лагуне, который иногда соединяется с соседним островом Торчелло песчаными отмелями. Здесь практически не бывает туристов — постоянных жителей всего один дом и 11 человек, проживающих на острове. Это бывший гостевой дом при разрушенном монастыре, сохранившийся со времен, когда в этих местах располагался крупный религиозный комплекс. Но это уединённое место превратится в эпицентр светского события — гала-ужина в честь предстоящей свадьбы основателя Amazon Джеффа Безоса и Лорен Санчес, сообщает Daily Mail. Гости и уровень безопасности На мероприятие приглашены около 200 высокопоставленных гостей — среди них такие знаменитости и бизнес-иконы, как Ким Кардашьян с матерью Крис Дженнер, медиамагнат Барри Диллер с женой Дианой фон Фюрстенберг, а также множество других миллиардеров и миллионеров. Их доставят на остров катерами, ведь добираться сюда из центра Венеции, с Гранд-канала, займет около получаса. Лорен Санчес, по предварительным данным, прилетит на вертолёте, приземлившись на плавучей площадке вспомогательного судна Abeona — части флота, поддерживающего мега-яхту Koru. Для гостей организована охрана «президентского уровня». О вилле и организации Главное место торжества — вилла Баслини, отреставрированное в 1950-х годах здание с пятью спальнями. Это историческое поместье является элитной арендной недвижимостью, забронированной на ближайшие два года. Известно, что именно эта вилла вдохновила Эрнеста Хемингуэя на написание романа . Организаторы свадьбы — компания Lanza & Baucina, основанная в Лондоне, — буквально в последний момент обеспечили аренду этого уникального места. По словам знакомого с организацией события свадебного планировщика, выбор острова — «очень мудрое и оригинальное решение», далёкое от банальных шаблонов. Изменения в планах из-за внешних факторов Планы свадьбы пришлось корректировать из-за обострения военной ситуации на Ближнем Востоке и связанных с ней мер безопасности. Первоначально центральным местом торжества должна была стать яхта Безоса Koru стоимостью 500 миллионов долларов. Однако в связи с протестами против роскошного мероприятия («No Space For Bezos») и опасениями по безопасности, яхту оставили у побережья хорватского острова Крес. Сейчас яхта Koru не задействована в торжествах и будет оставаться на якоре в Хорватии, а часть гостей и Безос с семьёй проводят время на вспомогательной яхте Abeona. Главные события свадебных торжеств День 1 — Гала-ужин (четверг, остров Сан-Джованни Эванжелиста) Собравшиеся за длинными столами виноградников наслаждаются ужином на фоне лагуны. Мероприятие окружено строжайшей охраной и максимально бережным отношением к окружающей среде. День 2 — Свадебная церемония (пятница, остров Сан-Джорджо Маджоре) Церемония пройдет в открытом амфитеатре «Зелёный театр» — недавно обновлённом компанией Foster + Partners. Амфитеатр вмещает до 1500 гостей и украшен белым камнем из Виченцы, окружён живой изгородью. После церемонии запланирован ужин на свежем воздухе или в исторических залах острова. По окончании будут фейерверки. Предполагается, что к мероприятию может присоединиться редактор Vogue Анна Винтур, хотя в это же время в Париже проходит дебютный показ нового креативного директора Dior Джонатана Андерсона. Свадебное платье невесты — от Dolce & Gabbana, выбранное ею по личным предпочтениям и с одобрением Винтур. В последующие дни Санчес сменит несколько образов, в том числе наряды Oscar de la Renta. День 3 — Бал (суббота, Арсенале) Бал пройдет в Арсенале — исторической верфи Венеции. Это большое, закрытое и охраняемое пространство с единственным входом. В прошлом здесь проходили крупные арт-выставки и благотворительные мероприятия amfAR. В Арсенале есть огромные залы, которые можно преобразовать в роскошные вечерние площадки, что делает это место удобным для масштабного и приватного праздника. Дополнительные мероприятия Помимо основных торжеств, в Венеции и на других маленьких островах лагуны, таких как Сакка Сессола, Бурано и Джудекка, а также на арендованных яхтах пройдут частные вечеринки и экскурсии. Гости получат возможность посетить музеи, включая знаменитые коллекции Пегги Гуггенхайм и Пино при Палаццо Грасси. Планы после свадьбы После венчания яхта Koru направится в Таормину на Сицилии — место, которое Безос и Санчес полюбили во время прошлогоднего путешествия. Там они остановятся в известном отеле Four Seasons San Domenico Palace, где снимали второй сезон сериала . Ожидается, что молодожёны сделают крупные пожертвования в венецианские благотворительные организации, однако официальные заявления будут сделаны уже после окончания свадьбы — чтобы избежать впечатления «покупки» города."

mov_AF44AAC8951AFEFF2A9BE3DA821E17ED,2025-06-27 08:07:22,en,WEB,"  People take photos of the new Louis Vuitton store in Shanghai By Casey Hall SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Louis Vuitton's latest Shanghai store is not your average luxury flagship. The 30-meter-high, ship-shaped store, ""The Louis"", is billed as an experience, and houses an exhibition space and cafe in Shanghai's downtown Nanjing Road shopping strip. ""The Louis"", which had a grand opening on Thursday, will undoubtedly draw crowds eager to post pictures to social media of its gleaming facade and the photo-ready exhibits inside. But LVMH-owned Louis Vuitton will also be hoping it can stimulate sales among Chinese consumers whose spending on luxury goods has slowed. LVMH's business strategy aligns with a broader shift among luxury goods retailers from a transactional model - where a shop merely sells goods to customers - to enticing customers with ""experiences"" that ultimately spur growth. The stakes are high for the luxury brands, which for years have relied on brisk sales in China to fuel their global growth, and ambitions, but are now facing a slowdown in demand in the world's second-biggest economy. The size of the Chinese market declined more than 18% last year to around 350 billion yuan ($48.80 billion) and sales are on track for a flat performance in 2025, according to estimates from consultancy Bain. Zino Helmlinger, head of China retail at real estate service provider CRBE, acknowledges that the luxury segment as a whole in China has taken ""a hit"" recently, though he believes the slowdown was expected. “If you look at the megastars - I mean LVMH, Kering, Richemont, Hermès - they almost tripled their profit within five years,"" he said. ""At some point, there is some counterbalancing, there is only so much you can grow, only so much you can generate."" In the first quarter, LVMH's revenue in the region that includes China fell 11% on an organic basis - the Asia-Pacific excluding Japan accounts for 30% of the group's total sales. Chinese consumers, hard hit by broader economic uncertainty and a prolonged property market downturn, have tightened spending on discretionary purchases - luxury branded handbags among them. Shanghai native Natalie Chen, 31, says she already owns enough ""stuff"" and has redirected a significant portion of the funds she once used for luxury goods to travel. ""Truthfully speaking, I don't feel that buying another bag will improve my life,"" she said, though she has already visited a new restaurant opened by Prada in Shanghai and intends to check out Louis Vuitton's new cafe concept with girlfriends. ""It brings a different kind of feeling than just [shopping] in a mall,"" Chen said, though she was unsure the ship-shaped store would lead her to make any purchases outside of coffee and cake. Still, the luxury brands are sensing a longer term opportunity to pump-prime sales. While appetite for personal luxury goods in China and around the world is declining, hurt by economic pressures and price fatigue, sales rates of ""experiential goods"" are rising, according to Bain, which highlighted a surge in personalized luxury hospitality experiences and rising fine dining sales in its spring luxury report. In 2024, for example, the overall personal luxury goods market worldwide fell 1% to 3% even as experiential luxury spending rose 5%, Bain said. LUXURY EVOLUTION New research released by real estate advisor Savills earlier this month points to this as a significant new trend in what it describes as China's ""evolving"" luxury market, in which people seeking out experiences are lured with more experiential luxury brand touchpoints, from restaurants to Salon Privé - private, appointment-only lounges for VIP shoppers. ""All the brands are closing stores, but those that can afford to are also opening big flagships or holding some big events or exhibitions to keep their visibility extremely high,"" said Patrice Nordey, CEO of Shanghai-based innovation consultancy Trajectry, essentially preparing for future success when the market picks up again. Brands from Balenciaga to Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Prada have all closed stores in China since the second-half of last year. Gucci is on track to close 10 stores in the market this year, Helmlinger said. Louis Vuitton's stablemate Dior opened a cafe concept in Chengdu earlier this year, and in March Prada opened a Wong Kar Wai-designed restaurant at its Rong Zhai cultural space in Shanghai. Jeweller Tiffany and Co. recently downsized a large downtown Shanghai store, but in March it also opened a new three-storey flagship in Chengdu. Nordey says that while more people refer to this trend as ""experiential"" retail, it actually speaks to something much deeper. ""I think it's a way of looking at your customer, either as someone that will buy products, or as an individual who is trying to have a more fulfilling life,"" he said. ""If your purpose is not only to feed your client with consumer products, but more than that, you might actually resonate more strongly with them."" While high-profile luxury store closures in mainland China have prompted speculation of brands lessening investment in a slowing market, CRBE's Helmlinger says the real story is more nuanced, indicating a strategic realignment of resources, rather than a pullback in the market. ""You need to create this concept of rarity, and rarity comes with scarcity,"" he said. ""When you have 80 or 90 stores in one market, it doesn't seem so rare anymore, it seems like it's mainstream.""

È raro che una notizia riguardante l'industria della moda – e più in particolare l'editoria fashion – diventi un argomento di discussione oltre i confini del settore. Tutto cambia, però, quando la news ha come protagonista una delle figure più riconoscibili e chiacchierate di quel mondo. Da questa notte, allora, non si parla altro di Anna Wintour che lascia Vogue. Si tratta senza dubbio di uno stravolgimento storico (la giornalista inglese guidava il magazine dal 1988), ma non di un addio. Wintour, infatti, manterrà il suo ruolo di direttrice editoriale globale di tutte le edizioni di Vogue. Mentre si apre la difficile ricerca del suo successore, la notizia che Anna Wintour lascia Vogue segna la chiusura di un capitolo molto importante per la rivista e per la fashion industry in generale. Da Londra a New York Classe 1949, Anna Wintour vanta la doppia cittadinanza inglese e statunitense. Figlia del direttore del quotidiano Evening Standard, Wintour muove i primi passi nella moda nella Swinging London degli anni Sessanta. La sua carriera giornalistica inizia proprio nella capitale brittanica dove, in seguito ad una parentesi nella Grande Mela, assume il ruolo di direttrice di British Vogue, nel 1985. Tre anni più tardi, invece, torna nuovamente a New York dove viene nominata direttrice di Vogue America. 37 anni dopo, il magazine ha cambiato identità e pelle e Wintour è diventata un'icona.

È rimasta celebre, ad esempio, la sua prima copertina da direttrice di Vogue, in cui appariva un paio di jeans, circostanza tutt'altro che usuale, insieme ad un pullover prezioso di Christian Lacroix. Questa apertura verso il nuovo, verso una moda più “libera” e meno ingessata, non fu accolta subito con grande favore. Allo stesso modo, l'intuizione di Wintour di mettere in copertina star, attrici e cantanti fece storcere a molti il naso. Ma contribuì in modo decisivo alla creazione della celebrity culture per come la conosciamo oggi, nel bene e nel male.

Non poteva essere altrimenti visto un look tanto riconoscibile: quel caschetto rigoroso e sempre voluminoso al punto giusto, accompagnato da grandi occhiali da sole neri, l'hanno resa un personaggio inconfondibile. La sua fama – di donna potente quanto di figura che incute terrore – è stata poi cementata dal successo de Il Diavolo Veste Prada. Nel film tratto dal romanzo di Lauren Weisberger, ex assistente della vera Wintour, una magistrale Meryl Streep ricalca i modi e l'atteggiamento della donna più influente della moda. Leggi anche Influenza e prestigio Anna Wintour si è affermata come una delle personalità più influenti dell'industria della moda. Dal 1999, infatti, organizza il celebre Met Gala, evento di beneficienza nato per raccogliere fondi per il Costume Institute del Metropolitan Museum di New York, trasformatosi in uno dei red carpet più fotografati. Wintour svolge spesso anche il ruolo di consigliera e mecenate. Si deve a lei, ad esempio, il graduale ma definitivo ritorno sulle scene di John Galliano, che dopo lo scandalo che gli costò il lavoro da Christian Dior è tornato in auge alla guida di Maison Margiela, raccogliendo innumerevoli omaggi e citazioni all'ultimo Met Gala.

Su un volo verso New York, la direttrice di Vogue America si ritrovò tra le mani un bigliettino in cui uno studente della Parsons le diceva di voler lavorare a tutti i costi nell'industria della moda. Un paio di settimane dopo, Michael Kors offrì a quel ragazzo uno stage. Si trattava di Lazaro Hernandez che, insieme a Jack McCollough, avrebbe poi fondato Proenza Schouler, per approdare oggi alla guida di Loewe. Wintour si innamorò della collezione di tesi realizzata dal duo, tanto da farla fotografare da Helmut Newton in un servizio curato da Grace Coddington. Abiti midi stampati e collier preziosi rappresentano le fondamenta dell'uniforme fashion di Wintour (Photo by Gotham/GC Images) Leggi anche Oggi l'ex direttrice di Vogue America, invece, consiglia la futura sposa Lauren Sanchez nella scelta dei look per il faraonico matrimonio veneziano con il magnate di Amazon, Jeff Bezos. Leggi anche Un culto trasversale Anna Wintour è da sempre oggetto di critiche ed elogi. Su TikTok, ad esempio, si susseguono video che raccolgono le reazioni della direttrice seduta in prima fila alle sfilate. Si contano, poi, le poche e dunque storiche standing ovation concesse da Wintour ai designer più amati, come Tom Ford e Sarah Burton. Le generazioni più giovani, in ogni caso, sembrano ben consapevoli delle zone d'ombra nell'operato della giornalista inglese. Dall'imposizione di un canone di bellezza votato alla magrezza alla mancanza di diversità etnica, oggi le sue pubblicazioni vengono giudicate sotto una nuova luce. Leggi anche..."

Memorabilia and clothing from the late Princess of Wales are up for sale in Los Angeles and includes a cheque for £5.50 which she signed just weeks before marrying the then Prince Charles in 1981. The cheque is expected to raise £3,000 but it is items of Diana's clothing that are likely to sell for the highest amounts - with a cream oil Catherine Walker falcon gown designed for her tour of the Gulf in 1986 expected to fetch between $200,000 and $300,000. The dress was worn by Diana - who died in a Paris car crash in 1997 - to a private dinner in Saudi Arabia and she was never pictured in it. A blue silk floral dress that the princess wore on several occasions is expected to fetch a similar figure while a magenta nylon ski-suit and a peach-coloured hat made for her to wear on her honeymoon are among the apparel going under the hammer. Other items include Diana's beloved Dior handbag - which was officially renamed as the 'Lady Dior' by the fashion house in her honour - and birthday cards and handwritten notes that she sent to friends and staff. The sale is taking place at Julien's Auctions in Beverly Hills, which previously sold a ballgown belonging to the princess for a record-breaking $1.14 million. Some of the outfits were auctioned off by Diana herself in the months before her death and Julien's Auctions co-founder Martin Nolan explained that the same clothing is reselling for far more money almost 30 years later. He said: ""They're considered an investment item and they're a great conversation piece. People love Diana worldwide and we sadly only knew Diana for 16 years. Yet we feel she's still with us and we want the connection to her and the items provide that connection. That's the tangible conduit to the story. That's what we're selling."" Nolan expects interest in the sale to be high around the world but believes that the items that belonged to Diana will appeal most to those in the United States. He said: ""Diana is loved and appreciated and celebrated in the UK but she's absolutely held on a high pedestal here in the US. I've seen this with the people who are registering to take part in the auction from rural locations in various states who are suddenly awakened by the opportunity to own something from her life and career."""

mov_B49C883EC6C5C58946E02D10ACBFB8FC,2025-06-27 09:50:27,en,WEB,"  The global Luxury Perfume Market, long anchored in heritage, exclusivity, and in-store experiences, is undergoing a digital transformation. As consumer behavior shifts toward convenience and personalization, luxury fragrance brands are increasingly leveraging e-commerce, subscription services, and digital marketing strategies to capture a broader and more diverse audience. This evolution is not only revitalizing legacy brands but also giving rise to independent perfume houses with cult followings. Rise of Online Platforms and E-Commerce Channels Traditionally, luxury perfumes were purchased through upscale department stores and boutique outlets. However, the COVID-19 pandemic accelerated a trend that had already begun—shopping for high-end fragrances online. Today, consumers are more comfortable purchasing luxury items through digital platforms, even without sampling them physically beforehand. E-commerce now accounts for a growing share of perfume sales, and luxury brands are responding by enhancing their digital storefronts with interactive features, detailed product descriptions, and high-quality visuals. Brands like Chanel, Dior, and Tom Ford have invested heavily in their online presence, offering virtual consultations and online-exclusive fragrance collections. Third-party platforms such as Sephora, Net-a-Porter, and Farfetch also serve as critical digital touchpoints, providing access to a wide range of luxury scents for global consumers. In markets like the United States, China, and the Middle East, younger consumers—particularly Millennials and Gen Z—are driving this online shift. These tech-savvy customers expect seamless browsing, secure transactions, and fast delivery, all of which are now becoming standard offerings from luxury fragrance retailers. Subscription Models Bring Personalization and Discovery Subscription models have added a layer of innovation to the luxury perfume space, appealing to consumers who value variety and personalized experiences. Companies like Scentbird, Luxury Scent Box, and Sniph are disrupting the traditional buying process by offering curated monthly fragrance selections delivered to customers' doorsteps. These services allow consumers to experiment with designer and niche fragrances without committing to a full-sized bottle, often priced between $100 and $300. By using quizzes and algorithms, subscription platforms tailor offerings to individual preferences, such as floral, woody, or oriental scent profiles. Luxury brands are beginning to collaborate with subscription services as a way to introduce new launches and limited-edition fragrances to targeted customer segments. In some cases, consumers who discover a new favorite through a subscription service go on to purchase full-sized versions through brand websites, closing the loop between exploration and conversion. This model is also sustainable and consumer-friendly, reducing fragrance waste and enabling brands to test new product concepts with minimal risk. Social Media Campaigns Drive Brand Storytelling and Engagement In today's competitive landscape, having a premium product is only part of the equation—effective storytelling and emotional resonance are equally essential. Social media platforms, particularly Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube, have become powerful tools for fragrance brands to connect with audiences in more intimate and creative ways. High-quality visuals, aspirational videos, and behind-the-scenes content help convey the craftsmanship, ingredients, and brand heritage associated with each scent. Influencers and content creators play a pivotal role in this process, offering authentic reviews and unboxing experiences that resonate with younger consumers. A 2024 report by Euromonitor noted that nearly 60% of Gen Z perfume buyers discover new fragrances via influencer content and social media advertising. Brands like Le Labo, Byredo, and Maison Francis Kurkdjian have successfully cultivated loyal online communities by emphasizing authenticity, artistry, and clean ingredients. These niche brands often rely more on digital campaigns and word-of-mouth than on traditional advertising, highlighting how social media can level the playing field between established and emerging players. In addition to organic posts and influencer collaborations, luxury fragrance houses are investing in paid social media campaigns using targeted ads to reach specific demographics, based on age, gender, and scent preferences. Augmented reality filters, immersive storytelling, and interactive polls are increasingly used to engage consumers and boost brand recall. Data-Driven Strategies Enhance Consumer Experience As luxury brands deepen their digital footprint, the use of customer data and analytics is becoming crucial. From tracking online behavior to understanding purchasing patterns, data helps brands refine product offerings, personalize marketing messages, and optimize the timing of promotions. AI and machine learning are being applied to improve scent recommendations, identify trends, and streamline inventory. Some brands are even experimenting with virtual scent experiences using scent-matching quizzes and AR-enhanced features that mimic the olfactory experience of testing a perfume in-store. Luxury brands are also integrating loyalty programs and exclusive access to incentivize repeat purchases and deepen customer relationships. For instance, some offer early access to new releases or personalized engraving services to loyal online customers. Conclusion The luxury perfume market is no longer confined to glass display cases and exclusive brick-and-mortar boutiques. Online platforms, subscription models, and social media campaigns are transforming the way consumers discover, experience, and purchase fragrances. While the essence of luxury—quality, craftsmanship, and exclusivity—remains unchanged, the pathways through which these values are communicated and delivered are being redefined. This digital shift offers tremendous growth opportunities for established brands and newcomers alike. By embracing innovation without compromising their core identity, luxury perfume brands are well-positioned to captivate the next generation of fragrance enthusiasts across the globe."
mov_92C33B9706791185C951F5088896A406,2025-06-27 09:54:03,en,WEB,"  Paris, France – With the Eiffel Tower as its eternal backdrop and couture dreams woven into every corner of the city, Paris Fashion Week is in full swing — and it's already delivering unforgettable moments. From Laduma Ngxokolo's MaXhosa Africa injecting vibrant heritage into the runways, to Louis Vuitton's cultural spectacle under Pharrell Williams, the fashion capital is buzzing with artistry, bold statements, and celebrity sparkle. Here are the standout highlights so far: LADUMA NGXOKOLO: MAXHOSA AFRICA MAKES HISTORY South Africa's fashion pioneer Laduma Ngxokolo lit up Paris with his powerful debut, showcasing MaXhosa Africa in a collection that celebrated identity, legacy, and luxury. Known for his rich use of Xhosa-inspired patterns and knitwear storytelling, Laduma's show was a colourful celebration of African royalty on a global runway. Models adorned in geometric motifs, earthy tones, and beaded details strutted confidently — offering a blend of contemporary silhouettes and traditional design philosophies. From oversized cardigans to tailored knitwear suits and layered accessories, the collection stood out as both fashion-forward and culturally grounded. It was a milestone moment for African fashion, met with rapturous applause and growing international media interest. YVES SAINT LAURENT: SEDUCTION UNDER THE STARS Saint Laurent, once again, brought high drama and Parisian poise with a twilight runway set against the shimmering Eiffel Tower. Creative director Anthony Vaccarello played with sharp silhouettes, clean lines, and sheer fabrics to deliver a collection that oozed mystery, sensuality, and modern power dressing. Models floated across the marble stage in sheer blouses, ultra-wide shoulders, cinched waists, and floor-grazing coats — all in a sleek palette of black, olive, and bronze. The contrast of structured tailoring and flowing fabrics spoke to the timeless Saint Laurent woman: bold, seductive, and unapologetically confident. Among those in attendance: Zoë Kravitz, Catherine Deneuve, and Janelle Monáe, all perfectly embodying the house's fearless elegance. Sourced – The Guardian LOUIS VUITTON: PHARRELL'S VISION OF TOMORROW In his latest outing as Men's Creative Director of Louis Vuitton, Pharrell Williams delivered a vibrant, genre-defying spectacle that merged street culture with classic luxury. The show took place at the Château de Vincennes, transforming the historic castle into a futuristic playground for fashion. The collection featured embroidered varsity jackets, pearl-adorned denim, beaded cargo trousers, and Pharrell's now-signature pixelated monogram print. There was a clear nod to hip-hop heritage and African American influence, seamlessly woven into the DNA of French luxury. The star-studded front row included Beyoncé and Jay-Z, LeBron James, Tyler, the Creator, and Naomi Campbell — a powerful cross-section of fashion, music, and cultural icons. As Pharrell performed live to close the show, the energy was less fashion week and more cultural reset. STREET STYLE: HIGH HEELS, BIG STATEMENTS, AND ARCHIVAL TREASURES While the runways dazzle, the streets of Paris are a fashion week spectacle in their own right. Stylists, influencers, models, and editors have been serving looks that blur the line between fashion fantasy and personal flair. Oversized trenches, bold color blocking, vintage Dior saddle bags, and 2000s revival pieces have ruled the sidewalks. South African model Blue Mbombo was spotted in a MaXhosa Africa knit poncho, perfectly blending heritage and trend. Meanwhile, Rihanna, ever the fashion disruptor, stepped out in a floor-length leather coat and dramatic sunglasses, causing a frenzy among photographers. From Balenciaga boots to archival Jean Paul Gaultier, this season's street style is loud, fearless, and full of personality — an echo of the runway's breaking of boundaries. From MaXhosa's cultural craftsmanship to Yves Saint Laurent's sleek seduction and Pharrell's genre-pushing Vuitton, Paris Fashion Week has already cemented its status as the heartbeat of global fashion. Sourced from Instagram With days still to go and more legends and newcomers ready to make waves, one thing is clear: the fashion capital isn't just showcasing clothes — it's shaping a new, inclusive, and electrifying future of style."

Lo de la pareja de la que venimos a hablar hoy empezó como un escándalo, pero terminó convirtiéndose en una de las historias de amor más seguidas, y comentadas, del mundo del entretenimiento y los negocios. Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sánchez se conocieron en 2018, cuando ella aún estaba casada y él era el hombre más rico del planeta. Su relación, inicialmente filtrada por la prensa, se consolidó rápidamente en público: ella dejó su trabajo como presentadora, él transformó su imagen de CEO algo 'nerd' en la de un magnate admirado, y juntos comenzaron una nueva vida llena de helicópteros, superyates y apariciones cuidadosamente orquestadas en eventos de élite. Fue en 2023 cuando anunciaron su compromiso, con un anillo de proporciones desorbitadas y una puesta en escena de película a bordo del Koru, el yate de 127 metros que navega con una figura decorativa en proa inspirada en la propia Lauren. Desde entonces, la expectación ha ido creciendo a medida que se filtraban detalles del futuro enlace. Y no es para menos: se trata de la autodenominada 'novia del siglo', con una lista de amigos VIP y el presupuesto ilimitado que sólo alguien como Bezos puede ofrecer. En Venecia, donde esta semana se paraliza la ciudad, se celebra no sólo una boda, sino un espectáculo de poder, lujo y moda. Porque sí, son 27 vestidos los que lucirá Lauren Sánchez durante este maratón nupcial que incluye fiestas de espuma, cenas temáticas y un baile de máscaras (al más puro estilo 'Los Bridgerton'). La moda ha decidido volcarse con ella, adaptando sus proporciones para que cada 'look' cuente una historia distinta. Desde Schiaparelli, con el que apareció en un primer look de estilo corsé con bordados florales, hasta Oscar de la Renta, Dolce & Gabbana o incluso Dior, todas las casas más importantes del mundo han competido durante meses por formar parte de este proyecto de boda. Según fuentes cercanas a la pareja, el primero de estos vestidos se encargó hace seis meses y el último, hace apenas dos. El presupuesto estimado ronda el millón y medio de euros, aunque aquí el dinero es sólo una herramienta más para reafirmar su estatus. La lista de invitados, como era de esperar, también ha hecho temblar los cimientos del Gran Canal. Ya están en Venecia miembros del clan Kardashian (Kim, Khloé, Kendall, Kylie y la matriarca, Kris Jenner), Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Vittoria Ceretti, la reina Rania de Jordania, el chef José Andrés, Tom Brady, Ivanka Trump u Orlando Bloom, quien acudirá sin acompañante tras su reciente ruptura con Katy Perry. También se ha visto moverse por los palacios venecianos a diseñadores, magnates, aristócratas y 'celebrities' de todos los rincones del planeta, aunque eso sí: ni un sólo veneciano ha sido invitado. Todo ha sido orquestado por la empresa Lanza y Baucina, dirigida por tres primos aristócratas italianos, quienes han convertido esta boda en un evento a medio camino entre la realeza y una producción de Netflix con presupuesto ilimitado. Y mientras el mundo observa, ellos simplemente se miran. A su manera, esta pareja ha sabido construir una relación que desafía convenciones. Lauren, ex piloto de helicópteros y madre de tres hijos, ha encontrado en Jeff un compañero con quien reinventarse. Él, que ha cambiado las 'cookies' por la meditación y la organización doméstica, parece haber hallado la paz en esta historia de amor que empezó con titulares sensacionalistas y acabará entre los muros dorados de un palacio veneciano."

mov_B0D25EC9FA908B83A42D12C09BFAF6CA,2025-06-27 13:55:14,en,WEB,"  Jenna Bush Hager revealed how she really felt about the Jeff Bezos wedding Lauren Sanchez and the Amazon tycoon are set to marry in Venice today Jenna Bush Hager made a shocking admission during her Jenna & Friends show on Thursday, revealing that she would 'hate' to be a guest at Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos' Italian wedding this week. The Amazon tycoon is set to wed his bride-to-be later today in Venice in front of 200 A-listers, including Ivanka Trump, Jared Kushner, Kim Kardashian and singer Usher. The couple are said to have rented out a number of places in the Italian city to celebrate the lavish nuptials, and kicked things off with a luxe welcome party on Thursday, where guests were transported by water taxi. An insider told DailyMail.com last week that San Georgio Maggiore island is 'off-limits to visitors' from June 24 to June 29. The original plan was for a huge party at the Scuola Grande della Misericordia on Saturday night, but it has now been moved to another venue in the Arsenale area of the city, according to local media. However, the extravaganza is something that Bush definitely doesn't want to be part of, as she spoke about it on Thursday with guest co-host Maria Shriver. 'Everybody's talking about it,' Jenna said during the daytime talk show. ' It's really public. There's protests in Venice, which I personally would hate.' 'Because, like you said, they're celebrating their love,' Jenna continued, as she reflected on what her own wedding to husband Henry Hager was like in 2008. Of course, Jenna is the daughter of former President George W. Bush and former first lady Laura Bush. 'When I got married a long time ago, I was so worried about people finding out where I was getting married,' she shared. 'We did it in my parents' backyard in Crawford, Texas, where nobody could be except for the people we loved,' Jenna added. The former first daughter added that she felt 'a little badly' for the couple and all the publicity surrounding their nuptials, although she admitted that it seems like it's what they wanted. But fury from locals has been brewing in the past week towards the couple for 'taking over the city,' forcing them to hire a team of former US marines for security. Around 20 anti-capitalist activists were seen Thursday morning holding placards in St Mark's Square, the iconic heart of Venice, with some trying to climb a post. An extinction rebellion flag was being waved, with one of the signs reading 'we are the 99 percent we have the power.' Another campaigner held one saying 'the planet burns' in Italian while being carried away by police. There have been other criticisms regarding over-tourism, how much tax Jeff Bezos pays and his environmental impact. Earlier this week, Greenpeace activists unfurled a huge banner the square showing Bezos' face and the slogan: 'If you can rent Venice for your wedding then you can pay more tax.' Activists from British group 'Everyone Hates Elon' were also involved and said they had carried it out to highlight the 'environmental and social injustice of the wedding.' One said: 'Bezos encapsulates an economic and social model which is steering us towards collapse. 'All to often now social injustice travels on an equal par with the climate, on one side the arrogance of a few billionaires who have a lifestyle that devastates the planet, the other people who suffer daily from the environment crisis.' So far, there's definitely been no shortage of publicity around their wedding, as guests arrived for a lavish welcome party Thursday evening. Sánchez donned a shimmering gold corset for the evening that formed the bodice of a dress whose fabric was as sumptuous as its silhouette was suffocating. Culled from Schiaparelli's 2025 couture collection the dress wasn't bespoke but it certainly took some clout to secure it and comes with a price tag of up to $100,000. Designed to showcase her impossibly tiny waist and impeccably toned physique, the intricately embroidered floral detailing covered both its skirt and modest neckline. She paired the look with a pair of dark colored, champagne pumps and diamond stud earrings, her hair in a gorgeous updo. Meanwhile, Ivanka Trump threatened to steal the show after showcasing an incredible designer dress, a jaw-dropping mini by Oscar de la Renta. Her outfit of choice, which can be found in the bridal selection on the website, is called the Cherry Blossom Sequin dress. It is sold out online but retails for $9,990. The stunning frock is covered in ombre sequins, cascading down from an almost-white pale pink to a slightly darker hue. Delicate cherry-blossom florals feature along the bust with a vine-inspired halter neckline completing the summery look. On the other hand, Kim Kardashian didn't seem to be following the summer wedding theme as she stepped out in a curve-hugging, snakeskin dress with bedazzled straps and a lace-up detailing at the bust. She wore a dark smokey eye and a large cocktail ring, bringing the look together with her extra-long pink nails Her sister Khloé Kardashian had the same issues in a similarly gray, overly textured dress. It featured bizarre gray strips over a sheer layer, and its dipping neckline exposed a heft portion of her black bra. And it looks like all of this opulence is thanks to Sánchez herself, as her hubby-to-be revealed in a 2023 Vogue interview that he wouldn't dare get involved with wedding planning. 'Oh, God, no. Do I look that dumb?' Bezos told the outlet when he was asked if he had a big part in the preparations. During the interview, the future Mrs. Bezos listed Christian Dior, Dolce & Gabbana, and Valentino as some of her favorite designers, but didn't share anything about which one will make her gown - or gowns, for that matter."

C'è anche un po' di Napoli nella cerimonia VIP Matrimonio Jeff Bezos. È il matrimonio dell'anno, forse del decennio. Jeff Bezos, fondatore di Amazon e tra gli uomini più ricchi del mondo, ha scelto Venezia per coronare il suo sogno d'amore con la giornalista e imprenditrice Lauren Sánchez. La città lagunare è diventata, per tre giorni, un palcoscenico internazionale fatto di eleganza, lusso, ospiti famosi. Ma da Napoli sono arrivati alcuni noti cuochi che si sono occupati del catering. Un po' di Napoli sulla tavola di Jeff Bezos Tre giorni di festeggiamenti sono in corso per il super matrimonio di Jeff Bezos. Il magnate di Amazon ha scelto, però, di portare anche un po' di Napoli tra i suoi piatti. Sono infatti protagonisti per la cura del catering alcuni dei più famosi chef campani. Spuntano infatti i nomi della Famiglia Mellino, del noto ristorante Quattro Passi a Nerano. Presente anche Ciro Oliva, della storica Concettina ai Tre Santi. La sezione dolci è affidata, invece, a Sal De Riso, iconico e famosissimo pasticciere della Costa di Amalfi. Tre giorni di festa in location iconiche di Venezia La cerimonia non è stata una semplice giornata di festeggiamenti, ma un vero e proprio evento articolato su tre giornate, ognuna ambientata in una diversa e prestigiosa location veneziana: Mercoledì 26 giugno, i festeggiamenti sono cominciati con un ricevimento esclusivo presso il chiostro della Chiesa della Madonna dell'Orto, nel cuore di Cannaregio. Una cornice gotica e silenziosa per accogliere gli ospiti con privacy e fascino. Il giorno successivo, giovedì 27 giugno, si è tenuta la cerimonia ufficiale di matrimonio a San Giorgio Maggiore, l'isola simbolo di Venezia. In questo scenario da sogno, la coppia si è scambiata gli anelli, accompagnata dalla voce emozionante di Matteo Bocelli, figlio del celebre Andrea. Infine, venerdì 28 giugno, gran gala conclusivo all'Arsenale di Venezia, uno degli spazi più suggestivi e riservati della città, scelto anche per motivi di sicurezza. Qui si vocifera si esibiranno Lady Gaga, e forse persino Elton John. VIP, lusso e cifre da capogiro per il matrimonio di Bezos Tra i circa 200 invitati vip figurano nomi del calibro di Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Ivanka Trump, Orlando Bloom, Oprah Winfrey, Katy Perry e Leonardo DiCaprio. Un parterre de rois che ha trasformato Venezia in una piccola Hollywood galleggiante. Secondo fonti locali e internazionali, l'intera organizzazione del matrimonio Bezos a Venezia avrebbe richiesto un investimento tra i 10 e i 30 milioni di euro, con un ritorno economico per la città stimato tra i 20 e i 30 milioni. Ma non è tutto: per ringraziare Venezia dell'accoglienza e per sostenere la tutela del patrimonio artistico, Bezos e Sánchez hanno donato 3 milioni di euro alle istituzioni locali. Una cifra che servirà per progetti di restauro e valorizzazione culturale. Lauren Sánchez ha sfoggiato fino a 27 abiti da sogno, firmati da brand internazionali come Dior, Dolce & Gabbana e Oscar de la Renta, per un valore stimato in oltre 1,5 milioni di euro.

mov_6536EDD1FD58D164E307AA6FA5A4F587,2025-06-27 15:55:11,en,WEB,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Daniel Craig looked stylish as he joined South Korean band Tomorrow X Together at the Dior Homme show during Paris Fashion Week on Friday. The actor, 57, wore an oversized tweed blazer with a blue striped shirt and a red tie layered underneath. He completed his outfit with a pair of dark jeans and dressed his look down with chunky white trainers. Daniel posed for photos at the brand's Spring-Summer 2026 collection by Tomorrow X Together. The band, formed of Yeonjun, Soobin, Beomgyu, Taehyun, and HueningKai, released their first single via Big Hit Music in 2019. Daniel, who finished his time as James Bond with the 2021 film No Time To Die, is looking world's away from 007 with his much longer hair. The actor - who was a widely popular Bond - enjoyed a five-film stint with the franchise, beginning with the 2006 movie Casino Royale. During his days as 007 he sported a more rugged look than he does now, with Craig often seen opting for a longer hairstyle at events post-Bond. Fans of the franchise are speculating over who will replace Daniel as the spy. The iconic role remains open to offers some four years after Daniel ditched the tuxedo, hung up the Walther PP and handed over the keys to his beloved Aston Martin. And with Amazon having bought the rights to Britain's longest running film franchise - the next film will be its 26th - the debate around who will seize the baton and become Bond number seven remains hotter than ever. To date, the likes of Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Henry Cavill, Regé-Jean Page, Richard Madden and Idris Elba have been touted as potential candidates. Amazon recently took over 'creative control' of the much-loved franchise and are said to be fast-tracking the new film, with Hollywood producers David Heyman and Amy Pascal hired to usher in a new era. Bookmaker William Hill sees Aaron Taylor-Johnson the most likely to take over at odds of 11/8, while Theo James sits at 7/2. Right behind Aaron Pierre and Henry Cavill is Happy Valley actor James Norton, and chasing his tail is Slow Horses actor Jack Lowden. Earlier this month, betting companies released their odds for the next James Bond villain - with one unexpected household name topping the list. The favourite was then none other than Peaky Blinders star Cillian Murphy, who sits at the top of OLBG's odds at 9/2. The Irish actor - best known for playing Thomas Shelby in the hit BBC show - had previously been touted for the part of Bond but played down speculation, telling Deadline: 'I think I'm a bit old for that.' Also in the running to play the Bond bad guy are American actor Paul Giamatti (11/2), The Boogeyman star David Dastmalchian (13/2), and unlikely contender Zendaya (7/1). Despite 'usually playing the good guy' in her previous roles, the female actress told Elle in 2023 that she's ready to enter her villainous era. 'I would love to play a villain of sorts,' the 28-year-old said. 'Tap into the evil, supervillain vibes. Whatever that manifests in, I don't think necessarily in a superhero sense, I just mean in like an emotional sense. 'I feel like I usually play the good guy, so I'd like to play the bad guy.' Amazon bosses are currently said to be considering locations in which to set the much-anticipated new film, which experts predicted is likely to be released at the end of next year or in 2027. Due to a filming ban being imposed in Central London next year, new locations are reportedly being considered - with Liverpool a frontrunner, according to The Sun. An insider told the publication: 'This will no doubt irk Bond purists who already fear Amazon taking over the 007 franchise may lead to them making big changes. 'But Liverpool is a well-known alternative to London for film-makers. 'It has appeared in everything from The Batman to Captain America and Harry Potter movies, doubling up as international cities.' The source added that it doesn't necessarily mean the story will be set in Liverpool - though eagle-eyed Merseysiders will no doubt spot their city centre in the background."

mov_0AEA6B394BB755493170E825903C0A00,2025-06-27 16:06:35,en,WEB,"  While you were fighting for your life in the incessant culture war between millennials and Gen Z – “We wore pop socks!” , “Well, we don't like them very much, actually!” – 's Daisy Jones turned her gaze to the only generation really worth talking about: Gen X. Often referred to as “forgotten” or “lost” thanks to their relative invisibility between the nefarious Boomers and ever-corny millennials, those born between the mid-1960s and early '80s include some of the coolest people to have ever walked the earth: Chloë Sevigny, Lee McQueen, Winona Ryder, Kate Moss, Naomi Campbell, Sofia Coppola, David Lynch. “Style-wise, Gen X was kind of a vibe, also,” Jones wrote in her paean. “Sometimes I watch old episodes of and think: no, but these girls ate. They weren't averse to a knee-high boot in the club, and they knew how to let loose.” Speaking of knee-highs: one of Gen X's most successful fashion inventions was the boot tuck: that is, the simple flourish of wearing boots over denim. It seems enough time has passed for the look to return, too. Back in February, British 's senior contributing fashion features editor Julia Hobbs took to New York Fashion Week in vintage slim-cut Levi's with Nicolas Ghesquière-era Balenciaga boots, while Kendall Jenner was earlier this week spotted with straight-leg jeans pulled into shin-high cowboy boots. The look feels fresh, and has been helped along, of course, by the rediscovery of drainpipe denim. “Skinny jeans walked,” said Hobbs, “so jeans-in-boots could run”. Perhaps it's about time, then, to revisit a handful of the OG boot tucks, as told by members of the 2000s pop cultural elite themselves. Musketeer boots + skinnies This has to be one of the best off-duty moments Kate Moss ever pulled off. The low-rise skinnies, the Musketeer boots, the Balenciaga City. Ugh. Alongside Alexa Chung and Sienna Miller, there really isn't anyone who embodies British cool quite like Moss did back then. And now, in 2025, when Y2K fever has reached its apex, her Noughties style specifically has never felt so current. Citizens of Humanity Baretta Straight-Leg High-Rise Jeans Miu Miu Brown Boots Low-rise + slouchy boots When people talk about early 2000s style, they'll often talk about Juicy Couture and Von Dutch and rhinestones, Paris Hilton and Lindsay Lohan and their little dogs in monogrammed Dior – but what about Keira Knightley in a slouchy boot?? This is precisely how people away from the red carpet actually dressed. L'Agence Sneeki Low-Rise Straight-Leg Jean Anthropologie Slouch Knee-High Boots Boho suedes If fashion is in the midst of a boho-chic revival, then Sienna Miller is without a doubt its North Star. The actress spent the vast majority of the Noughties in disc belts, peasant skirts, rough-hewn turquoise rings and mussed-up hair. (See: above.) She might have turned her back on the whole thing circa 2012, when she said ,“No more boho chic! Those two words make me sick”, but Miller still wears the hell out of a suede boot – and so should you. Vintage Brown Leather and Brass Studded Boho Statement Belt Isabel Marant Stania Studded Suede Ankle Boots Dark rinse + metallic boots Plenty of fashion people who've dared to squeeze back into skinnies have been left asking the same question: how do you make them feel new again? Julia Hobbs had one answer. For New York Fashion Week, she dug out a pair of red heeled knee-high boots from her own archive and paired them with light-wash skinnies.

mov_3FB6E725EE00FD02DF4A13753A376043,2025-06-27 16:26:37,en,WEB,"  Published on: June 27, 2025 The big day is finally here – Lauren Sanchez is walking down the aisle later today to marry Amazon tycoon Jeff Bezos as part of what's been dubbed the wedding of the year in Venice, Italy. The couple are set to say their 'I dos' in front of around 200 guests, which include A-listers like Ivanka Trump, Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner and Orlando Bloom. The pair are said to have rented out a number of places in the Italian city to celebrate the lavish nuptials, and kicked things off with a luxe welcome party on Thursday, where guests were transported by water taxi. An insider told DailyMail.com last week that San Georgio Maggiore island is largely 'off-limits to visitors' from June 24 to June 29. The original plan was for a huge party at the Scuola Grande della Misericordia on Saturday night, but it has now been moved to another venue in the Arsenale area of the city, according to local media. On Thursday evening, their guests arrived for a lavish welcome party, which saw the bride-to-be wearing a curve-hugging corset dress from Schiaparelli's 2025 couture collection. Her groom, Bezos, wore a gray suit and a cool pair of Dior sunglasses. But now that the two are finally set to become Mr. and Mrs. Bezos, here is FEMAIL's take on the worst fashion offenders of the day. Too much! Ahead of the big day, Kris Jenner and her daughter, Khloe Kardashian, were seen hitting the shops in Venice in a long-sleeve, leopard-print gown Weather confused?! Bill Gates and his partner Paula Hurd explored Venice Thursday, as he kept things very simple in a pair of long black shorts and matching polo t-shirt Kris Jenner looked a bit-over-the top as she strolled around Venice on Friday with daughter Khloé Kardashian, wearing a long-sleeve, leopard print frock in the summer heat. Jenner paired the dramatic dress with small, square black sunglasses and oversized, dangling bejeweled earrings, while her daughter kept it simple in a plain black dress and Chanel flip flops. Billionaire Bill Gates also looked out of place in the warm Venice weather as he donned an all-black outfit. Gates had on a pair of long black shorts, which he paired with a black polo t-shirt and navy blue polo cap. His partner, Paula Hurd, also opted for the dark color, wearing a sleeveless black tank dress which she matched with a seriously big diamond necklace. However, not everyone went for dark colors as they shopped and strolled ahead of the big day. Vittoria Ceretti, Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriend, looked straight out of an early 2000's magazine as she wore a vintage Betsey Johnson white dress with large gray and red floral motifs on it while out and about. She tied things together with a pair of lace-up white ballet flats and a small gray over-the-shoulder purse. So 2000 and late! Vittoria Ceretti, Leonardo DiCaprio's girlfriend, looked straight out of an early 2000's magazine as she wore a white dress with large gray and red floral motifs on it Butterfly fly away! Lydia Kives, who is married to Canadian investor Michael Kives, wore a sleeveless orange dress emblazoned with blue butterflies all over it Lydia Kives, who is married to Canadian investor Michael Kives, wore a sleeveless orange dress emblazoned with blue butterflies all over it, also opting for a busy print. She wore a bright yellow purse with the look, which also seemed like it could be from the early 2000's. But while these stars shop around Venice ahead of the big ceremony, fury from locals has been brewing in the past week towards the couple for 'taking over the city,' forcing them to hire a team of former US marines for security. Around 20 anti-capitalist activists were seen Thursday morning holding placards in St Mark's Square, the iconic heart of Venice, with some trying to climb a post. An extinction rebellion flag was being waved, with one of the signs reading 'we are the 99 percent we have the power.' Another campaigner held one saying 'the planet burns' in Italian while being carried away by police. There have been other criticisms regarding over-tourism, how much tax Jeff Bezos pays and his environmental impact. Earlier this week, Greenpeace activists unfurled a huge banner the square showing Bezos' face and the slogan: 'If you can rent Venice for your wedding then you can pay more tax.' Activists from British group 'Everyone Hates Elon' were also involved and said they had carried it out to highlight the 'environmental and social injustice of the wedding.'

mov_8AAA1BCCB2743A19DB10F1343556C340,2025-06-27 16:28:00,en,WEB,"  The Queen of Jordan is one of 200 guests at the Amazon CEO and Lauren Sanchez's wedding Queen Rania of Jordan's attendance at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's wedding in Venice came as quite a surprise for royal watchers when she landed yesterday. The ever-so-stylish Jordanian royal had a chic, understated look for her incognito arrival, but it's her outfit at the pre-wedding reception that truly had us floored. On Thursday, the 54-year-old was pictured at the reception in the most striking dress and gorgeous Barbie pink accessories, going for an all-round soft, summer-ready wedding guest look. Queen Rania brought out her gown from Fendi's Autumn/Winter 2018 couture collection, which she hadn't been pictured in until now. With a short-sleeved lilac bodice, a turtleneck neckline, and a net-like texture that flares towards the hem, it's a truly unique and eye-catching dress, perfect for an occasion such as a summer wedding. To accessorise, the mother of Crown Prince Hussein and Princess Iman opted for a brand-new pair of pink patent leather pumps from Gianvito Rossi, and a clutch that matched it perfectly. She layered over a shawl in the same hue to make the dress more covered. Rounding it all off, she wore some luxurious jewellery, including a pair of hoop earrings and a white gold bracelet from Dior. On all occasions, Queen Rania looks truly resplendent, so it comes as no surprise that, for a wedding as high-profile as this, she'd debut a showstopping piece. Queen Rania's incognito look Yesterday, when arriving in Venice for the wedding, the mother-of-four opted for an all-black ensemble, surrounded by security and staff while she walked along the boardwalk. Smart yet understated, her outfit was incredibly chic: Queen Rania wore a black top, with ruched detailing on the sleeves, a pair of combat-style, loose-fitting trousers with silver buckle details along the edges, and open-toed black sandals. A perfect, low-key summer look. She carried a black leather tote and a pair of trendy sunglasses to round it all off. Queen Rania is one of many famous attendees at the billionaire wedding of the summer, including Orlando Bloom, Elton John and more. HELLO! understands that the ceremony is set to take place on the private island of San Giorgio in a private church in the gardens, away from public access."

mov_0FC305692DE6BB224F62A1C643C1A0E3,2025-06-27 17:32:37,en,WEB,"  “What you see is what you know, and all I ever saw growing up was women cooking. My parents were very against the idea of it becoming my career. My family doesn't drink or eat pork, and they worried I wouldn't be able to avoid those things in a professional kitchen. When it was time to go to college, I started out studying finance at Baruch College, but I landed an internship at Time Inc. during my freshman year. From there, every internship I had was in fashion, beauty, or media. Halfway through college, I realized I didn't have the experience—or interest—for a finance job, so I created an ad hoc major that blended communications, marketing, and journalism, with a minor in art. My first job out of school was at BuzzFeed. By then, I'd already started posting food videos on TikTok and was gaining some traction. BuzzFeed had a talent incubator program where you could create content, and after two months there, Bon Appétit food director Chris Morocco emailed me about an assistant food editor position that was opening up. I interviewed and got the job. Less than six months into Bon Appétit, I signed with a manager. I was feeling overwhelmed by influencer work, which had become a real—and lucrative—part of my life, and I didn't want to give it up. Pretty quickly, my team asked if I had any interest in doing a cookbook. I initially said no—it felt too soon—but they encouraged me to think it over. I did, and the book, Third Culture Cooking: Classic Recipes for a New Generation, took more than two years to make. If you're the child of immigrants—or come from a family that recently immigrated—the term third culture kid really resonates. For a long time, I couldn't make sense of the tension of being from two places. Both of my parents are of Indian descent, my grandma came from a farming family in East Africa, and I was raised in New Jersey. That in-between space is real, but different, and there's no blueprint for how to exist in it. So when I first heard the term, I felt an immediate sense of peace. It was like, Oh—I don't have to pick. I exist here. And that's enough. My cooking is third culture cooking. I'm not exclusively doing American classics, and I'm not strictly recreating my grandmother's recipes either. A term like fusion might sound similar, but it feels hollow and it lacks context. Third culture cooking has layers—there's history, storytelling, and meaning. BEAUTY I feel uniquely lucky to have always been surrounded by women. My mom is a hairdresser and aesthetician by trade, and I have two sisters. Seeing them interact with beauty made me feel like This is what girls do. This is a part of girlhood. Also, the idea of getting ready has always been part of my life. As someone who wears a scarf, there are a few steps before you head out the door—I have to put my scarf on, and if I'm doing that, I might as well put on some lip gloss. One of my sisters wears a scarf too, so she's my go-to for hair stuff because she's in the know. My other sister and I talk about skincare constantly, because when you're framing your face with a scarf, your skin is everything because that's all people see. SKINCARE The Drunk Elephant line was truly revelatory for me. I was maybe 18 when I discovered it, and a few of their products completely changed my skin. Their Beste cleanser is super soft on my skin—it's what I travel with because it removes anything left after my first cleanse with Sulwhasoo's cleansing oil. I also like the Youth To The People's and Kiehl's Ultra Facial cleansers. And if I want gentle physical exfoliation, Humanrace's Rice Powder is my go-to. My skin always looks smooth afterward, and makeup goes on beautifully. Another game-changer: I bought a 15-pack of washcloths and switch them out every night. For chemical exfoliation, I tone with Ren's Ready Steady tonic, usually in place of my Drunk Elephant T.L.C. Framboos serum, which has glycolic acid. And I've been using Tower 28's SOS spray for over a year—I can't travel without it. It has hypochlorous acid and helps calm my skin and reduce hormonal breakouts. And TikTok convinced me to try Beauty of Joseon's Revive eye serum, and I swear my eyes look brighter since I started using it. During the day, I like Drunk Elephant's C-Firma serum. I've tried the vitamin C from Skinceuticals, but like everyone says, it smells like hot dog water and was too much for me...."
mov_826E8AD3C1E8DEA73717C90CC1CB65AB,2025-06-27 17:37:33,en,WEB,"  Lauren Sánchez isn't skimping on the bling now that she's Mrs. Bezos. Here, she blows a kiss while wearing her original $2.5 million pink diamond engagement ring on her right hand. AFP via Mrs. Bezos gets the bling. Lauren Sánchez is dressing to impress during her lavish wedding week in Venice, Italy, having already shown off looks by Alaïa, Alexander McQueen, Dior and Schiaparelli Haute Couture ahead of the big day. And she's accessorizing those designer styles with some truly dazzling diamonds. On her left ring finger, she's been sporting an enormous oval-cut diamond that's even larger. REUTERS Sánchez paired both rings with a Schiaparelli Haute Couture corset gown for Thursday night's welcome party. Nicolas Geradin Explore More Page Six exclusively reported that Sánchez and Bezos, who will marry in a lavish $50 million celebration on Friday surrounded by A-list guests, have already tied the knot legally in the United States — and she may have gotten a bonus ring as a result. On Thursday, the future Mrs. Bezos, 55, paired her stunning Schiaparelli gown with her original $2.5 million pink diamond engagement ring — which she moved to her right hand — and a second, even larger oval-cut sparkler, which she sported on her left. Based on visual proportions compared to her first engagement ring, Ajay Anand, CEO of Rare Carat, estimates the new bauble could be up to 45 carats in size. “And knowing Bezos, it's likely a D flawless, which would put the value easily north of $6 million [for a stone that big],” he tells Page Six Style. The helicopter pilot showed off her original ring on the red carpet in September 2023, shortly after Jeff Bezos popped the question. GC Images The colored stone is among the most rare in the world, as over 90% of the global supply came from Australia's now-closed Argyle Mine, which ceased operations in 2020. Matt Baron/BEI/Shutterstock The jaw-dropping stone dwarfs Sánchez's original, which clocks in at around 20 carats. It's “among the rarest and most coveted colored diamonds in the world” and “exceptionally scarce,” as Zack Stone, diamond expert for Steven Stone Jewellers tells us. He tells us Sánchez's new elongated oval-cut diamond could be the work of legendary jeweler Joel Arthur Rosenthal, commonly known as JAR — as first noted by WhoWoreWhatJewels on Instagram — and Stone estimates the value at around $4 million. Shop 'til you drop with Post Wanted Save time and money with the latest deals, discounts, trends, reviews and more. Thanks for signing up! Sánchez's upgraded ring appears to feature JAR's iconic Thread setting, marked by a two-tiered pavé threadwork gallery and prongs. A 22.76-carat version with the same setting sold at Christie's in 2018 for $2.7 million. “Graded D color — the most rare and valuable on the diamond color scale — it appears completely colorless both to the naked eye and under magnification,” Stone tells us of the magnificent auctioned ring. The Amazon founder seemingly lavished his bride with diamonds ahead of their big day. Evan Agostini/Invision/AP At the 2025 Vanity Fair Oscar Party earlier this year, Sánchez appeared to wear the same oval-cut sparkler she brought to Venice. Variety via Eagle-eyed fans believe it could be a creation from legendary jeweler Joel Arthur Rosenthal, known as JAR. for Vanity Fair “The stone also boasts a VVS1 clarity grade, placing it among the most pristine quality diamonds available. Notably slim and shallow in proportion, the diamond has an elegant, elongated presence that enhances its brilliance.” We also exclusively reported that Bezos gifted his future wife a diamond necklace worth between $3 million and $5 million, which she's expected to wear at some point this weekend. An insider told us, “It's said Lauren will wear a long list of precious jewels throughout the festivities that could easily be worth up to $20 or $30-plus million.” We'll be sure to keep an eye out — though shine of this caliber's hard to miss."
1ceaedb79cd91cd1df94c716cda96ce9,2025-06-27 17:41:00,en,WEB,"  On the final day of her grand Venetian wedding celebration, Lauren Sánchez delivered a moment of timeless elegance. Departing the Aman Hotel en route to the ceremony on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, the bride-to-be exuded grace in a tailored cream silk suit by Dior. The structured ensemble featured a softly cinched waist, exaggerated shoulders, and oversized black buttons that added subtle drama to the minimalist silhouette. Paired with a matching midi-length skirt, the look was completed with an ivory and chocolate-brown silk headscarf tied neatly under her chin, channeling Old Hollywood glamour. Oversized black sunglasses shielded her eyes from the Venetian sun while her signature brunette hair peeked out from under the scarf. Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos looked elegant in a formal jet-black tuxedo, complete with satin lapels and a white shirt. The Amazon founder added a touch of flair with classic round sunglasses. As the couple prepared to celebrate with an exclusive guest list of A-listers, they showcased head-turning ensembles. On Thursday, Lauren stepped out of the Aman Hotel wearing a stunning Schiaparelli creation from the brand's Spring 2025. The dress blended both high couture elegance and opulent fantasy. The dress features a dramatic off-the-shoulder neckline that flares into a structured, sculptural fold, embroidered with intricate botanical and abstract eye motifs in shades of teal, sage, gold, and seafoam. The dress includes a sculptural corset that cinches her waist perfectly. With her hair pulled back in soft waves and finished with pearl earrings, the ensemble is the perfect choice for her third look as the wedding ceremony approaches. Meanwhile, Jeff opted for a classic look, wearing a sleek charcoal ensemble. He paired the perfectly tailored suit with a classic white dress shirt, left slightly unbuttoned. He wore a pair of aviator sunglasses and smiled and waved to the cameras waiting outside the hotel. On Wednesday, Lauren exuded evening glamour in a body-hugging, one-shoulder gown featuring a black silhouette adorned with silver sequin stripes that spiral diagonally. The shimmering embellishments elevated the gown, as the soon-to-be bride brought festive opulence with her first look. Her gown was the perfect choice for the opening night of their high-profile celebration. She completed the look with classic and understated accessories, including a sleek black clutch and subtle drop earrings. The media personality styled her signature brunette hair in voluminous waves with soft highlights and rocked a glamorous makeup look. Meanwhile, Jeff looked effortlessly polished in a casual yet sophisticated ensemble. The billionaire was all smiles in a well-tailored black suit with a soft texture — likely linen or lightweight wool. Instead of a button-up shirt, he opted for a more relaxed ivory knit top and completed the outfit with aviator-style sunglasses. The power couple landed in Venice, stepping off a private helicopter and looking happier than ever ahead of the wedding. Lauren turned heads in a stunning black halter dress paired with strappy stilettos and a minimalist clutch. By her side, Jeff kept it classic in a fitted black polo and crisp white trousers, finished with aviators and a watch peeking from beneath his rolled sleeve."

Los superyates de los famosos invitados navegan por la laguna y el famoso hotel Aman elegido por los novios, un palacio renacentista con un precio mínimo de 2.000 euros (2.340 dólares) por noche, ha colgado el cartel de completo. Preguntado por lo que más le gustaba de la ciudad de los canales, el multimillonario estadounidense dijo sonriente junto a su mujer en una lancha: “¡Miren a su alrededor! Esta ciudad parece imposible, no puede existir, y, sin embargo, aquí está”, se le oye decir en un vídeo publicado el jueves por la noche por el diario La Repubblica. Para Chiara Trabuio, de 26 años, “esta boda es aceptable hasta cierto punto porque genera dinero”. “Pero va contra la cultura y la naturaleza de la ciudad”, dice esta estudiante, que vive en Mestre, una localidad en tierra firme justo enfrente de Venecia. Según la prensa italiana, Bezos, de 61 años, y Sánchez, de 55, ya casados por lo civil en Estados Unidos, intercambiarán sus anillos y sus votos matrimoniales en la isla de San Giorgio Maggiore, situada frente al Arsenal, la antigua base naval de la ciudad. Looks de Lauren Sánchez en su boda con Jeff Bezos La boda se celebrará en un gran anfiteatro al aire libre en la isla, desde donde se ve la plaza de San Marco. Los novios recibirán una serenata de Matteo Bocelli, hijo del famoso cantante de ópera Andrea Bocelli. Según la prensa, Sánchez tiene previsto lucir 27 vestidos durante las celebraciones que incluyen un baile de máscaras, tal como si se tratara de la serie de Netflix, Bridgerton. Diferentes diseñadores pusieron su atención en ella, ya que es la mujer del momento e hicieron sus apuestas en ella, con el objetivo de que con cada look, cuenta una historia totalmente diferente. Algunos de los diseñadores reconocidos que porta y portará Lauren Sánchez por estos días son: Schiaparelli, Oscar de la Renta, Dolce & Gabbana, Dior, entre otros. Como es del interés de varios seguidores, se especula que el presupuesto estimado para estas prendas oscila entre el millón y millón y medio de euros, sin embargo, esto no ha sido confirmado. Entre los invitados figuran la estrella de la telerrealidad Kim Kardashian, la hija del presidente estadounidense Ivanka Trump, la estrella del fútbol americano Tom Brady, el actor de Hollywood Leonardo DiCaprio, la reina Rania de Jordania o la presentadora Oprah Winfrey, y más. *Con información de AFP. 2025-06-27T16:59"

Pop star Katy, 40, is notably absent from the extravagant wedding celebrations in Venice, Italy, amid her split from fiancé Orlando Bloom, which was confirmed by sources on Thursday after weeks of rampant speculation. While the mom-of-one received a sweet public message from bride-to-be Lauren earlier in the week, she has since returned the favor and has fawned over the future Mrs Bezos's wedding weekend attire. Styled by celebrity stylist Jamie Mizrahi, Lauren oozed elegance in a Dior co-ord, which she wore as she boarded a water taxi outside the plush Aman hotel. Her bridal look was shared far and wide on social media by celebrity hairstylist Rick Henry, which prompted an outpouring of praise from fans. Amongst those fans was Roar singer Katy, who gushed in all-caps: 'WAIT THIS IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE LEWK.' Others also heaped praise underneath the upload, with one writing in the comments: 'Lauren you look SO STUNNING! This is everything.' 'Perfection!!! Crushing it,' another agreed. A third added: 'You look beautiful. I love this look.' Although Katy attended Lauren's bachelorette party in Paris, rumors of 'tensions' between Katy and Orlando began to surface earlier this month. Several outlets alleged that the singer's poor-performing album 143 and the mocking she faced following her Blue Origin space trip — as well as her ongoing Lifetimes Tour — put 'stress' on the relationship. The hitmaker was also recently seen without her engagement ring. Furthering the speculation, it was confirmed that Orlando would be attending Lauren and Jeff's wedding without Katy, who is on tour in Australia. Katy and Orlando first got together in 2016 before splitting up and getting back together in 2018. Orlando proposed in 2019 and they welcomed daughter Daisy Dove, now four-years-old, in August 2020. Neither party have spoken publicly on the split reports. Orlando arrived in Venice on Wednesday afternoon along with the likes of A-list wedding guests like Kim Kardashian, Tom Brady and Leonardo DiCaprio. He shared a kiss with Kim, 44 — who he once famously 'checked out' while at an event with Katy last year — as he caught up with her and her sister Khloe just before the festivities began. He was also photographed jumping into a boat to shelter from torrential rain and was photographed embracing celebrity stylist, Jamie, on Thursday night. On Friday morning, Orlando was pictured smiling in workout clothes and cap on the terrace of the Gritti Palace Hotel - one of five of the city's most luxurious hotels booked out by the Amazon billionaire to host his 250 influential guests. The star, whose former partner is putting on a brave face while touring Australia with their daughter spoke to guests as he ate a late breakfast and drank cappuccinos in the Veneto sunshine. Orlando also laughed wildly while speaking to an immaculately dressed waiter and drank his coffee while looking out on one of the city's canals. Additionally, the Pirates of the Caribbean star was spotted in what appeared to be a deep and heartfelt conversation with none other than Oprah Winfrey on the eve of the billionaire couple's nuptials. He leaned in intently, hands clasped behind his back, as the queen of self-help placed her hands on his shoulders — seemingly offering him a private dose of wisdom and encouragement. On the morning of the wedding, Katy took to Instagram to share a series of snaps of herself with her arm wrapped around a quokka in a photo dump that she captioned: 'mood: Quokka.' Quick to share a sweet message of support, Lauren commented: 'We miss you Katy.'"

Les festivités ont malgré tout été lancées le 26 juin par un somptueux dîner de bienvenue dans le décor gothique de l'église Madonna dell'Orto à Venise. Pour cette première apparition, l'ancienne journaliste a fait sensation dans une création Schiaparelli issue de la collection haute couture printemps-été 2025 baptisée « Icarus » par Daniel Roseberry. La robe, dans un délicat ton champagne, dévoilait un corsage brodé de perles dorées et une encolure bustier parsemée de fleurs, de feuillages et d'yeux mystiques brodés main aux nuances de bleu, vert et marron. Une silhouette sculpturale, marquée par une taille cintrée et une jupe midi à la coupe sablier.

'I almost gave in,' she admitted. ' But I want it to be a surprise. As you get a little older, not many things surprise you. I can't wait to see his face.' Lauren was quick to change her Instagram username to include her new name, swapping it to @laurensanchezbezos and wiping out all of her old posts. Their lavish multi-day wedding celebration is estimated to have cost them $20 million. A slew of their famous friends including Gayle King, Oprah Winfrey, Ivanka Trump, Orlando Bloom, Usher, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kendall Jenner, and Kylie Jenner, amongst others, are all in attendance. Guests arriving at the luxurious affair were greeted to the sounds of trumpets, violins and a Gospel Choir. Hours earlier, the award-winning journalist made her first appearance of the day when she was spotted leaving the five star Aman Hotel in a ladylike white Dior puff sleeve suit, paired with a head scarf and oversized sunglasses. She also appeared to show off a brand new enormous diamond ring for the occasion. Last night, it was revealed that Jeff and Lauren had already married legally ahead of today's ceremony on San Giorgio Maggiore island. They kicked off the weekend-long celebrations with a star-studded welcome dinner on Thursday evening at the Campo Della Madonna dell'Orto. But the billionaire couple and their A-list guests were forced to take cover from a freak thunderstorm during the pre-wedding party. Lauren donned a shimmering $100,000 dress designed by Daniel Roseberry for the celebration. The figure-hugging frock was embroidered with designs of swirling vines and florals in blue, green, and gold tones that were set against a champagne fabric. The pair are said to have rented out a number of places in the Italian city to celebrate the lavish nuptials. An insider told DailyMail.com last week that San Georgio Maggiore island is largely 'off-limits to visitors' from June 24 to June 29. The original plan was for a huge party at the Scuola Grande della Misericordia on Saturday night, but it has now been moved to another venue in the Arsenale area of the city, according to local media."

mov_2A929EBB72F73A3A6CD10E899AAC7A4D,2025-06-27 21:24:05,en,WEB,"  The bride showed off a new bauble from jeweler to the stars Lorraine Schwartz Sánchez stepped out in a $100k Schiaparelli gown paired with a $4m sparkler Lauren Sanchez is famous for her pricey designer dresses and lavish jewelry, including her reported $2.5 million pink diamond engagement ring. Now, Sánchez, 55, is showing off her own brand new bauble, courtesy of jeweler to the stars, Lorraine Schwartz, as she weds Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, 61, in custom Dolce & Gabbana. Her original ring is about 20 carats and she showed it off after he popped the question aboard his $500 million superyacht. The platinum band is studded with diamonds with an enormous rock on top, but her new oval-cut option just might be even more impressive. During the award winning journalist's wedding week in Venice, Italy, Sánchez first showed off the ring when she stepped out in a Schiaparelli gown that she paired with the stunning Schwartz sparkler. Schwartz has also designed for celebrities including Beyonce, Kim Kardashian and Isha Ambani, who had a star-studded wedding of her own in 2018. Irina Aran, the founder of Facets Fine Jewelry, believes the ring is about 30-carats and could be worth between $1.5 million and $3 million. 'It's a standout for its size and brilliance,' Aran, based in New York, told DailyMail.com. However, that estimate might be on the low end, according to Jason Arasheben, known as 'Jason of Beverly Hills' to his celebrity clientele. Jason believes the ring is closer to 30 to 40 carats, which would mean it costs closer to $4 or $5 million. Of course, the multi-million dollar ring wasn't the biggest expense of the weekend, which is said to cost $20 million. The couple also splashed out on her custom Dolce & Gabbana gown, as well as the other designer outfits she wore throughout the weekend from Schiaparelli, Dior and more. Her Schiaparelli look came from the 2025 couture collection and wasn't bespoke, but did come with a hefty price tag of $100,000. Plus, the Amazon boss reportedly gifted his new bride a diamond necklace worth $3 to $5 million for their wedding weekend, according to Page Six. She also donned a sweet bracelet with her new initials, LB, paying tribute to her hubby. They didn't just splash out on diamonds and clothing - the loved up couple also had to pay a pretty penny for tight security to keep their celebrity guests (including the Kardashians, Leonardo DiCaprio, Katy Perry, and Ivanka Trump) safe from protesters and paparazzi. The lavish three-day event included a party held within the 15th-century Madonna dell'Orto church in Venice's quaint Cannaregio. Venice City Hall issued a directive on Wednesday cordoning off the area, isolating guests from activists who had been protesting for weeks that the celebrations will turn the city of gondolas and palazzi into a private amusement park for the rich. In preparation, security guards blocked off entrances to the star-studded event."

The billionaire couple tied the knot today on San Giorgio Maggiore island in front of a dazzling array of star-studded guests. The bride, 55, took to Instagram moments after saying 'I do' to share a snap of her and Jeff together, which she captioned with the date. In the photo, the couple beamed from ear to ear, with Jeff wrapping his arm lovingly around her waist. Lauren showed off her stunning wedding dress in the image, which contained lacy, floral sleeves, a tight bodice, high neckline, long flowing skirt with an enormous train, and buttons down the front. The glamorous, figure-hugging number showcased her stunning physique. The blushing new bride's long brown tresses were pulled back behind a vail and she wore striking makeup. Her new husband, 61, for his part, donned a chic black tuxedo. Lauren also posed in the exquisite wedding dress for a pre-wedding photoshoot with Vogue magazine. While chatting with the publication, she recalled feeling like a 'princess' during her dress fitting, which took place in Milan, Italy.

Just an hour later, she followed up with some behind-the-scenes snaps of her wedding gown. In a carousel post, the former journalist was seen standing inside a decadent room in Venice, wearing the high-neck lace dress and showing off its dramatic silhouette. The second photo, a black and white image, showed Lauren and her team helping her get into the gown, while the third image featured designer Domenico Dolce placing the lace veil on her head. 'Not just a gown, a piece of poetry,' she captioned the post. ' Thank you @dolcegabbana for the magic you made.' Their lavish multi-day wedding celebration is estimated to have cost them $20 million. A slew of their famous friends including Gayle King, Oprah Winfrey, Ivanka Trump, Orlando Bloom, Usher, Leonardo DiCaprio, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kendall Jenner, and Kylie Jenner, amongst others, attended their nuptials. Guests at the luxurious affair were greeted to the sounds of trumpets, violins and a Gospel Choir when they arrived. The choir also broke out into song again after the couple said 'I do,' belting out Whitney Houston's Higher Love. Guests were heard cheering and singing along during the touching moment. Opera star Matteo Bocelli kicked off the couple's wedding reception, opening up his set with the iconic Elvis Presley track I Can't Help Falling in Love With You. The son of Italian tenor Andrea Bocelli was called in as his dad is performing in concerts in southern Italy this weekend and couldn't attend.

Bezos and Sánchez are exchanging their vows Friday evening on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, one of Venice's many small islands. The island is known for its church, which boasts a tall bell tower. Matteo Bocelli, son of opera singer Andrea Bocelli, is expected to perform. The three-day celebration began Thursday evening with a party at the Madonna dell'Orto, a 14th-century cathedral, and will conclude Saturday with a wedding reception at Venice's Arselane, an armory and shipyard that now hosts cultural festivals. Who Is Attending The Wedding? The couple invited dozens of A-list celebrity guests and billionaire friends, many of whom were photographed arriving in Venice this week. Fellow billionaires Bill Gates, Sam Altman, Barry Diller, Oprah Winfrey and Kim Kardashian are all in attendance. Much of the Kardashian family is in Venice for the wedding, including Khloé Kardashian, Kendall and Kylie Jenner and their mother, Kris Jenner. Celebrities in attendance include actors Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom and Sydney Sweeney, as well as ex-NFL player Tom Brady, singer Usher and journalist Gayle King. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner are in attendance, though President Donald Trump will not be there, as the Wall Street Journal reported he declined an invitation due to scheduling conflicts. Will Protests Disrupt The Wedding? It's unclear whether protests will interfere with Friday's ceremony, but the “No Space for Bezos” protest group has a demonstration planned for Saturday. The group has advertised a march on its Instagram , beginning at the Stazione di Venezia Santa Lucia train station, which is about 1.5 miles away from the Arsenale venue. The group has already held multiple protests in opposition to Bezos' wedding, which they have criticized as an excessive display of wealth in a city already strained by overtourism. Bezos was reportedly forced to move Saturday's event from a more central Venice location to the Arsenale after protesters threatened to block the canals.

mov_A15E547F9546E7DC1C2833A19F67781A,2025-06-27 22:41:52,en,WEB,"  The gospel choir sang Steve Winwood's Higher Love, the bride wore a brand new diamond ring and the groom was safely delivered by water taxi. In an event which was simultaneously wildly elite and deeply tacky, and amid heavy security, with a strong police presence and dozens of private ex-services bodyguards, Amazon billionaire Jeff Bezos exchanged vows with his second wife, Lauren Sanchez. His first marriage, to mousy Mackenzie Scott, was a quiet affair at the Breakers Hotel in Florida's Palm Beach in 1993. This ceremonial nuptial (the legal end having been concluded some time ago) was instead a spectacle for the world, hyped as 'the wedding of the century'. It took place in the 'green theatre', a renovated amphitheatre in a forest situated on the Venetian island of San Giorgio Maggiore, where the Cini Foundation runs a museum and art galleries on the site of a former monastery. The forest was transformed into an enchanted garden, with lanterns, flowers, chandeliers, and tables laid out alongside the maze. And by the time the celebrities, politicians and business titans had arrived for the spectacle, one thing was sure: nobody bought the rumour that Bezos was getting out of this spending a measly $5 million any more. Indeed, to emphasise the billionaire-ness of it all, before the exchange of rings between bride and groom Sanchez had done another exchange of rings of her own. Her 30-carat $3 million pink diamond, presented by Bezos when he asked her to marry him two years ago, had been switched to her right hand... and in its place a yet larger, brilliant-white diamond, estimated at 35 carats and worth $8-$10 million. You know that you are moving with the 0.001 per cent when a 30-carat diamond isn't quite up to the occasion. The socking great diamond upgrade rather gives lie to earlier claims that their three-day wedding is a simple – virtually low-budget – affair for close friends and family only. In fact there were more celebrities than anyone had predicted, from Leonardo DiCaprio and Oprah to the Kardashians and Sydney Sweeney. And of course, as revealed by the Mail yesterday, the couple actually got legally married quietly over a month ago, which is why no wedding licence has been taken out by them in Venice. Promptly at 4.30pm local time, around two hours before her guests started to arrive for the ceremony, Sanchez hopped into a water taxi and headed for San Giorgio Maggiore. She wore a Dior cream skirt suit, a silk 'Brides de Gala en Fleurs' Hermes headscarf and carried a Hermes Kelly bag in black crocodile – and appeared in high spirits, blowing kisses to photographers. Nine minutes later she was being helped ashore, and disappeared from view to get ready. She was attended by a glam squad of at least five: make-up artists Buster Knight and Laura Mele, hair stylist Sophie Rose and stylist Robbie Gutterman. Samuel Horowitz, who works for Dolce & Gabbana, was on hand to help her into her wedding dress which was created by the pair. The designers, famous for their corseted dresses, are friends of the bride. She was seen visiting their shop in Milan in late April, apparently for a fitting. In a photo uploaded to Instagram by Sanchez, the bride showed off her stunning wedding dress, which contained lacy, floral sleeves, a tight bodice, high neckline, long flowing skirt with an enormous train, and buttons down the front. The glamorous, figure-hugging number showcased her stunning physique. The blushing new bride's long brown tresses were pulled back behind a vail and she wore striking makeup. Her new husband, for his part, donned a chic black tuxedo. Sanchez also posed in the exquisite wedding dress for a pre-wedding photoshoot with Vogue magazine. While chatting with the publication, she recalled feeling like a 'princess' during her dress fitting, which took place in Milan, Italy. 'It was more powerful than I thought,' she added of the moment she put it on for the first time. Her groom arrived two hours later, wearing a Dolce & Gabbana tux, sunglasses, and a beaming smile. During the ceremony guests were serenaded by tenor Matteo Bocelli, son of operatic legend Andrew. Afterwards, there was a dinner by candlelight and chandelier, with huge displays of dendrobium orchids and roses, followed by fireworks. Police were advised that the party was due to break up between 3am and 4am. Local sources say the menu included Spaghetti alla Nerano prepared by Fabrizio Mellino, the chef at Quattro Passi, the 3-star Michelin restaurant located in the picturesque fishing village of Nerano, on the Sorrento Peninsula. It's a family recipe, first created in 1952 and there are three basic ingredients: thick Gragnano handmade spaghetti, fried zucchini and grated provolone cheese. To follow, a top pastry boutique in Minori near Amalfi called Sal De Riso, prepared 'a thousand portions of desserts': mignon pastries, sweets by the glass and single portions of lemon and ricotta and pear delights. There was a wedding cake, of course, baked by the renowned chef Cedric Grolet, the executive pastry chef at Le Meurice in Paris. During the day, newly single actor Orlando Bloom ducked away from the paparazzi to hang out with former American football star Tom Brady, who is the ex husband of Gisele Bundchen. The two men seem to have struck up a strong bond over the days long wedding. On Thursday night Bloom gallantly helped his old friend, socialite Dasha Zhukova (once married to Roman Abramovich) into a water taxi, and was spotted with his arm around Hollywood stylist Jamie Mizrahi. He has known both women for years, and both are married, but that hasn't stopped speculation Bloom is perhaps not all that broken-hearted over the end of his nine-year romance with pop's Katy Perry. Perry, who is on a break during the Australian leg of her tour, was sent a consoling message by Lauren Sanchez who posted: 'We miss you Katy' on her Instagram. Bezos and Sanchez have seven children between them, and all attended the wedding, as did the father of her son Nikko, Tony Gonzalez, and his wife Tobie. Tobie Gonzalez and Sanchez are so close that she came to her hen party in Paris last month. And that's not the end of the festivities – there will be a gala party at the Arsenale in Venice tonight, followed by a smaller post-event brunch pyjama party.

6ac97c53661c2cca77145960d0f90934,2025-06-27 22:48:00,en,WEB,"  Maybe more than any famous woman today, Lauren Sánchez knows her style. She likes hourglass silhouettes. Strapless dresses. Stiletto heels. Mermaid shapes that hug the hips and trumpet outward at the knee. Her uniform, down to her vintage pinup blowout, is astonishing in its consistency. Few women, paparazzi fixtures or not, appear to feel so confident about what they believe makes them look good. Rachel Tashjian Sanchez, who married Amazon founder (and Washington Post owner) Jeff Bezos on Friday in Venice, has transformed from C-list television journalist to bona fide billionaire celebrity. Their 200 wedding guests were nearly all A-listers — Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom, several members of the Kardashian-Jenner family and President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka and husband Jared Kushner — ensuring that the event would be a spectacle as glittering as the Met Gala or Vanity Fair Oscar Party. Stars and wealthy people of a more traditional stripe, who came up through entertainment or industries like tech or finance, are usually too private to so openly beckon the paparazzi. Sanchez lives out loud, and seems unapologetic about it. What's most compelling about Sanchez's ascent from a fashion perspective is that she has built up her public profile without changing her style. Confronted with the worlds of fashion, high society and culture, she has resisted the tasteful glow-up. She has remained, in appearance, herself. She is on the June digital cover of Vogue, smiling in her Dolce & Gabbana hand-appliquéd dress — but while Vogue described the look as a move away from her traditional style to a “more timeless and referential idea,” she remains in that fishtail silhouette, her waist corseted to waspish proportions. It was inspired, Sanchez said, by Sophia Loren — the celebrated classic Italian bombshell. Most celebrities undergo a transformation. When Kim Kardashian sought to evolve from reality TV star with a seedy sex tape backstory to Vogue mainstay and international tastemaker, she traded her come hither silhouettes for Phoebe Philo's elusive Celine designs: beautiful silk blouses and understated coats. Lady Gaga moved away from the avant-garde, Madonna-esque experiments of her early career to a more classical, Barbra Streisand-like chanteuse look when she sought an Oscar nomination for 2018's “A Star Is Born.” More recently, Brad Pitt — fresh off a finalized divorce and debuting a newish relationship, plus promoting a summer blockbuster — has started working with Taylor McNeill, stylist to Timothée Chalamet and Kendrick Lamar, and dressing in freakishly fashion-forward clothes. Politicians often do the same. First ladies will hire stylists or work with designers to sharpen their image. And when Kamala Harris began her whirlwind presidential campaign last summer, she enlisted Leslie Fremar, who's worked with actors like Charlize Theron and Jennifer Connelly, to dress her in snappy Chloe pantsuits rather than the frumpier, boxier suits she'd previously favored. Even Bezos has undergone the glow-up. In 2018, he revealed a newly muscled physique along with a wardrobe of bomber jackets and skinny jeans that hinted at his growing ambitions as an entrepreneur.

This pointed public evolution mirrors classic movie makeovers, like that of Tess in “Working Girl” and Vivian in “Pretty Woman.” Our starlet figures out that there's a secret, subtle language of wealth and influence. They learn how you look if you want to have both. Vogue boss Anna Wintour has often played a role in such transformations. Wintour has advised multiple first ladies on brands and stylists to work with (and, in fact, planned Huma Abedin's recent wedding in the Hamptons alongside Hillary Clinton), but she appears to have done little here other than cover Sanchez's wedding in splashy terms. There were added stakes to Sanchez's shifting reputation: She did not have a new project to promote, but a new role as the wife of one of the wealthiest men in the world to envision. It is in her hands to tell us what outrageous wealth looks like today, and she refused to show that she had any doubt about what that might be, even when she has been criticized for wearing clothes that some found too revealing, such as her plunging Alexander McQueen jacket at the inauguration ceremony earlier this year. That question is especially potent now. There is a line between the kind of celebrity who wears what pays and the kind who wears what pays off among the fashion crowd — on one side, those more subdued, if-you-know-you-know brands like the Row, Alaïa's more outre designs or Philo's low-key label, on the other, those who dress with the audaciousness of a well-monied eccentric, such as British aristocrat Daphne Guinness or Indian businesswoman Natasha Poonawalla. A number of fashion figures, such as Lauren Santo Domingo, Derek Blasberg and stylist Jamie Mizrahi (who works with Jennifer Lawrence and reportedly consulted on Bezos's looks for the weekend) are in attendance — but Sanchez does not appear to have earned their respect through style. She could have paid a plugged-in stylist like Danielle Goldberg or Kate Young to tell her what to wear to appeal to such a crowd (nearly every fashion house will let a wealthy client buy their couture clothes, even if their image doesn't align with their values). But pointedly, even as she's dressed in vintage Alexander McQueen and couture Schiaparelli and a Dior skirt suit these past few days, and is working with Sydney Sweeney's stylist Molly Dickson, she hasn't played the fashion game. The jacket of her Dior suit tugged a bit over her chest, and her Schiaparelli dress was perfectly in line with her previous red carpet looks. She has instead gravitated toward more conservative, mass appeal brands — in particular, ones who are rarely precious or picky about who they dress. Dolce & Gabbana has survived relentless scandal by partnering with the Kardashians (the designers styled the entirety of Kourtney Kardashian's 2022 wedding, including ensembles for the guests). Oscar de la Renta, another Sanchez favorite, has shrewdly refused to stick to the liberal pieties of much of the rest of the American fashion industry, dressing Usha Vance and Ivanka Trump for the inauguration in January. These clothes, unlike those that typically get fashion insiders talking, have little conceptual interest — they exist to flatter. Many of the wedding guests seem to have taken up this sartorial mission. The Kardashians, Sweeney, Ivanka Trump and several model attendees have been seen in outrageous but obvious dresses, fitted and gauche. We have spent the past five years lying to ourselves about fashion and wealth...."

В соцсетях она поделилась фотографиями, сделанными сегодня днём, незадолго до основной церемонии. Последние часы перед походом к алтарю 55-летняя Лорен провела в комплекте Dior из юбки и жакета, образ дополняли тёмные очки и крокодиловая сумка Kelly Hermès. Интересной деталью образа невесты стал шёлковый платок Hermès, цветочные мотивы которого отсылали к свадебной символике и который украшала фраза Brides de Gala en Fleurs, также отсылающая к свадебной теме. На самой церемонии Санчес появилась уже в платье Dolce & Gabbana, в котором угадывались отсылки к образу Софи Лорен в фильме ""Плавучий дом"". Свадебный образ Лорен дополнили драгоценности, в том числе обручальное кольцо в 30 каратов, которое сегодня обсуждали все. На предсвадебных вечеринках Санчес выгуляла несколько кутюрных образов, в том числе платье Schiaparelli и архивное платье Alexander McQueen. Образы гостей свадебных торжеств, среди которых были сёстры Кардашьян—Дженнер, Виттория Черетти, королева Иордании, Карли Клосс, Даша Жукова и Иванка Трамп, также заслуживают внимания, поскольку каждый день они меняют кутюрные наряды по несколько раз. На празднование ""свадьбы века"" одного из самых богатых людей мира в Венецию, несмотря на протесты местных жителей и сопутствующие скандалы, съехалось более 200 влиятельных, знаменитых и богатых людей мира, а бюджет трёхдневного праздника составит около 55 млн долларов. Напомним, Джефф Безос и Лорен Санчес вместе с 2019 года. Их роман начался, ещё когда оба были в браке. В результате Безос развёлся с женой Маккензи Скотт после 25 лет брака. Развод сделал её одной из самых богатых женщин в мире: поскольку у пары не было брачного договора, то после расставания Маккензи отошло около 35 млрд долларов. Санчес подала на развод с мужем на следующий же день после того, как завершился бракоразводный процесс Безоса. Помолвка состоялась в 2023 году, а в этом году пара планировала пожениться в Аспене, но всё пришлось отменить, так как информация о свадьбе утекла в сеть. В итоге выбрали Венецию, что не обрадовало местных жителей: тем удалось добиться частичного изменения программы. Перед свадьбой, кстати, Лорен успела слетать в космос — это был подарок жениха на свадьбу. Благодаря увлечению космосом и полётами пара и познакомилась (причём познакомил их муж Лорен). И если Безос к тому моменту был владельцем Amazon и одним из богатейших людей мира с состоянием в 227 млрд долларов, то Лорен — успешной журналисткой, которую неоднократно номинировали на премию ""Эмми"", телеведущей, актрисой, пилотом и владелицей собственной компании. Всё это исчезло с её страницы в инстаграме* сразу после свадьбы: теперь там пока только одно свадебное фото, а в описании профиля значится — Лорен Санчес Безос.

The billionaire tycoon wore black tie for the boat ride to the ceremony, with the actual venue a closely guarded secret. His bride wore an elegant cream Dior suit to get there, with a choice of designer dresses lined up for the exchange of vows. Dozens of A-list guests flew in for the occasion in a fleet of private jets. The extravagance and opulence of the wedding also set off a string of protests in Venice. Bezos said he would donate more than a million to local charities. Critics of low taxation of the ultra-wealthy point to the dangers of rich billionaires such as Bezos shaping politics with their donations rather than making tax contributions.

Now, Sánchez, 55, is showing off her own brand new bauble, courtesy of jeweler to the stars, Lorraine Schwartz, as she weds Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, 61, in custom Dolce & Gabbana. Her original ring is about 20 carats and she showed it off after he popped the question aboard his $500 million superyacht. The platinum band is studded with diamonds with an enormous rock on top, but her new oval-cut option just might be even more impressive. During the award winning journalist's wedding week in Venice, Italy, Sánchez first showed off the ring when she stepped out in a Schiaparelli gown that she paired with the stunning Schwartz sparkler. Schwartz has also designed for celebrities including Beyonce, Kim Kardashian and Isha Ambani, who had a star-studded wedding of her own in 2018. Lauren Sánchez stepped out in a Schiaparelli gown that she paired with a stunning sparkler Sánchez's new and improved ring might be even more impressive than her original dazzler Irina Aran, the founder of Facets Fine Jewelry, believes the ring is about 30-carats and could be worth between $1.5 million and $3 million. 'It's a standout for its size and brilliance,' Aran, based in New York, told DailyMail.com. However, that estimate might be on the low end, according to Jason Arasheben, known as 'Jason of Beverly Hills' to his celebrity clientele. Jason believes the ring is closer to 30 to 40 carats, which would mean it costs closer to $4 or $5 million. Of course, the multi-million dollar ring wasn't the biggest expense of the weekend, which is said to cost $20 million. The couple also splashed out on her custom Dolce & Gabbana gown, as well as the other designer outfits she wore throughout the weekend from Schiaparelli, Dior and more. Her Schiaparelli look came from the 2025 couture collection and wasn't bespoke, but did come with a hefty price tag of $100,000. Plus, the Amazon boss reportedly gifted his new bride a diamond necklace worth $3 to $5 million for their wedding weekend, according to Page Six. She also donned a sweet bracelet with her new initials, LB, paying tribute to her hubby. Sánchez is famous for her pricey designer dresses and lavish jewelry, including her collection of diamond rings Jeff Bezos reportedly gifted his new bride a diamond necklace worth $3 to $5 million for their wedding weekend They didn't just splash out on diamonds and clothing – the loved up couple also had to pay a pretty penny for tight security to keep their celebrity guests (including the Kardashians, Leonardo DiCaprio, Katy Perry, and Ivanka Trump) safe from protesters and paparazzi. The lavish three-day event included a party held within the 15th-century Madonna dell'Orto church in Venice's quaint Cannaregio. Venice City Hall issued a directive on Wednesday cordoning off the area, isolating guests from activists who had been protesting for weeks that the celebrations will turn the city of gondolas and palazzi into a private amusement park for the rich. In preparation, security guards blocked off entrances to the star-studded event."

The ceremony ended discreetly, except for a signal from the fashion world — a Vogue digital cover offering a first look at Sanchez's gown. After much speculation (and not-so-subtle sightings of designer Domenico Dolce in Venice), it revealed her dress was a custom design by Dolce & Gabbana and was a year and a half in the making. The high-necked lace corseted gown had 180 silk chiffon-covered priest buttons dotting the front. Over the course of the night, per Vogue, she had two more outfit changes: a sweetheart-neck dress — another reference, this time to the 1946 film “Gilda” — for the wedding dinner, and an intricate cocktail dress featuring 175,000 crystals by Oscar de la Renta.

Стилистика коллекции отсылает к атмосфере спортивного поля, раздевалок и теннисных турниров — с элементами кожаной униформы, шелковых шорт и фактурных жакетов. При этом всё выдержано в характерной для Dior сдержанной элегантности и тонкой провокации. Линии тела подчеркиваются, но не оголяются, а палитра остаётся монохромной с редкими вспышками серебра и кремового. На трибунах — почти целый актёрский состав «Претендентов». Джош О'Коннор, Майк Фейст, Дрю Старки и даже Дэниел Крейг — все прибыли в Париж, чтобы поддержать своего друга, режиссёра и вдохновителя показа Луку Гуаданьино. Сам Лука также присутствовал, явно довольный тем, как образы с экрана воплотились в тканях и силуэтах. Отсутствие Зендеи, главной звезды «Претендентов», стало заметным: пользователи соцсетей гадают, занята ли она съёмками третьей «Дюны» или просто не поддерживает направление модной эволюции Dior. Впрочем, актриса пока не комментирует. А вот фото мужчин-звёзд с показа уже стали вирусными — особенно образ Крейга, в мягком льняном костюме и солнцезащитных очках, который называют «бондовским отголоском». Модные критики уже прозвали показ попыткой выстроить новый квир-романтизм — с нотами ностальгии по 90-м и уважением к чувственной маскулинности. Dior, как всегда, балансирует между классикой и вызовом, удерживая внимание и модного сообщества, и широкой публики. Парижский показ Dior оказался не просто дефиле haute couture, а живой хроникой стирания границ — между спортом и модой, маскулинностью и уязвимостью, кино и подиумом. Отсылки к фильмам Гуаданьино стали поводом говорить о том, как мода оформляет эмоции поколения, а показ — своего рода любовным письмом тем, кто переосмысляет традиции. Фото: соцсети.

mov_C3560AFF5F6C101D2A4187A19FA512B6,2025-06-28 04:01:00,en,WEB,"  “Why did you want to interview me this time?” So begins a rare sitdown with Yohji Yamamoto. From one of the fashion great of our times, the question isn't posturing — it's genuine curiosity from someone whose lifelong North Star is the pursuit of the new and interesting. Plus, as far as the 81-year-old designer is concerned, he has said plenty already over the course of a career five decades long and counting. It's his designs that have done most of the talking, a conversation that spans collections for women and men, the 23-year-old Y-3 collaboration with Adidas plus a galaxy of lines under his eponymous company's umbrella. The Tokyo-based designer has been busy carving a singular track that started in 1972 under the Y's moniker. Contrary to the fashions of that era, what he offered was somber menswear-inflected looks that enveloped the female form in soft architectures of fabric. It became the founding act of his upheaval of the female silhouette that would ripple through the decades since. It netted him a cult following in Japan from his first show in 1977 and was amplified globally with his debut in Paris in 1981, an era that also saw the arrival of fellow designers and compatriots such as Rei Kawakubo, Issey Miyake and Kenzo Takada. In a nutshell, the face of fashion today would be very different had Yamamoto stayed on the course set by his 1966 law degree from the prestigious Keio university. A Law Unto Himself For fashion historian and Palais Galliera curator Alexandre Samson, “Yamamoto is one of the leaders of a movement that forced the Western gaze to evolve its definition of beauty in clothing but also the technical and structural development of garments.” There would have been no “Belgian Wave” had there not been Yamamoto and his Japanese designer compatriots who came to Paris in the 1980s, Samson believes. “Designers such as Craig Green, Rick Owens, and even some luxury streetwear owe a debt to Yamamoto's blend of intellectual rigor and anti-fashion aesthetics,” agrees Prof. Andrew Groves, director of the Westminster Menswear Archive at the University of Westminster. “His impact is less about surface imitation and more about shifting what fashion can be.” More in Style His design logic hinging on reframing, say, tailoring through new codes taken from uniforms or workwear “now feels ahead of its time” for the academic. “In an era where fashion is once again asking questions about purpose, material and identity, Yamamoto's approach of combining function, craft and ambiguity offers a clear alternative to fast, superficial design,” Groves continues. “It remains radical because it still resists easy consumption.” If the veteran designer continues to be relevant today, Groves says it “isn't about reinvention but about remaining unshaken within a fashion system addicted to change.” But being an innovator on the long run — and therefore one of WWD's Originals — is no mean feat, particularly in the early days. Imagine a then-conservative Parisian scene confronted with “clothing considered violent because they were deconstructed with an omnipresence of layers of dark, mostly black, tones, soft asymmetries and perforations that were treated like decoration,” Samson says. Each show set off flurries of commentary — good and bad. French press panned Yamamoto's first Parisian offerings while U.S.-based retailers raved, noting a surge in sales of wares from Japan's designers. Selma Weiser, the late founder of New York-based boutique Charivari, told WWD in 1981 that she found Yamamoto to be the most innovative designer to come alone in years, noting that “his details and structure are just wonderful” and naming a split-level jacket and matching black wool contoured, cropped pants as bestsellers in her store. By 1986, WWD opined “Sayonara” under a long pin-striped jacket and patching skirt paired with a jaunty hat shown in March that year, noting that Saks Fifth Avenue had “hated” the collection, and analyzing how Japanese fashion became “the wave that crested and crashed” six months later. No matter to Yamamoto, who kept marching to the beat of his own drum. He took multiple “bites into the Big Apple” with New York City boutique openings, inked a fragrance deal in 1994 and the Y-3 collaboration in 2002. That year, he also shifted his ready-to-wear shows to couture timings. A New Look for Men, Too Meanwhile, his designs for men were equally remarkable — and perhaps even more influential than in womenswear, posits Samson. Here, too, the Japanese designer brought radical change, explains Groves. “Yamamoto expanded what menswear could mean to a Western audience by introducing a radically different visual and cultural language into the heart of Paris fashion,” he tells WWD. “His work disrupted dominant ideas of structure, fit and masculinity not through confrontation, but through quiet insistence on other possibilities, loose silhouettes, draped forms, and a refusal to idealize the male body.” It's an approach that has suffused menswear since, palpable in the rise of conceptual menswear, designers focusing on silhouette rather than shows and an embrace of black as a creative language, according to the academic. Needless to say, accolades for his contribution to fashion have been aplenty, including France's Ordre des Arts et Lettres, where he is now a commander, and the Ordre National du Mérite. Cementing his pivotal position are exhibitions ranging from the 2005 “Just Clothes” at Paris' Musée de la Mode et du Textile, now a department of the Musée des Arts Décoratifs, and a 2011 retrospective at London's Victoria & Albert museum to a 2013 exhibition at the National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne, Australia, that put Yamamoto on an equal footing with Christian Dior in redefining the female silhouette. Yamamoto's unwavering line also served his company well. Revenue grew from the neighborhood of $15 million in wholesale in the early 1980s to some $100 million in the early 2000s. Bar a blip around 2009 when poor management led to debt and a subsequent deep restructuring, it's a healthy enterprise that has topped the $200 million mark. With around 700 employees and over 300 doors worldwide across all brands, growth is currently in the double digits. Store openings are coming at a steady clip, the most recent in Taipei, Taiwan, and Guangzhou, China. As for Y-3, it's been a pioneering endeavor that has helped define athleisure, then and now. A Lifelong Quest Not that you'd catch Yamamoto reminiscing about his considerable body of work. That's an exercise he hates as he's not shy about reminding anyone who probes in that direction. He has his eyes firmly forward, guided by the one imperative that drives him: “When I start designing, I want to do something new — for me,” as he told WWD after his spring 2024 show. And in his view, it's all been boiled down to one thing: a continuous iterative process to use black on a woman's body. That's not to say the designer, who often prefers to describe himself as a tailor and dressmaker, has eschewed references in his collection to Madeleine Vionnet, Dior, Gabrielle Chanel and Azzedine Alaïa shortly after the designer's passing. The fall 2018's passage influenced by the late Tunisian designer, a longtime friend of Yamamoto's, was “a rare moment in fashion history in which a living designer paid tribute to another designer who had passed away…so early and so literally” says Donatien Grau, adviser for contemporary programs at the Louvre Museum...."
mov_782190732E680AA0D0E64569F3F799DD,2025-06-28 04:13:21,en,WEB,"  It's been both the most public and secretive wedding of the year. On Friday, the main event of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's three-day-long Venetian extravaganza culminated in a private ceremony held on the secluded, historic San Giorgio Maggiore island in the San Marco sestiere. In the afternoon, the some 200 members of the celebrity guest list, including the Kardashian-Jenner family, Bill Gates, Karlie Kloss, Oprah Winfrey and Usher were all photographed stepping onto water taxis to ferry them to the festivities, but their visibility ended there, with guests seemingly adhering to an apparent social media blackout once inside each of the weekend's events. The ceremony ended discreetly, except for a signal from the fashion world — a Vogue digital cover offering a first look at Sanchez's gown. After much speculation (and not-so-subtle sightings of designer Domenico Dolce in Venice), it revealed her dress was a custom design by Dolce & Gabbana and was a year and a half in the making. The high-necked lace corseted gown had 180 silk chiffon-covered priest buttons dotting the front. Over the course of the night, per Vogue, she had two more outfit changes: a sweetheart-neck dress — another reference, this time to the 1946 film “Gilda” — for the wedding dinner, and an intricate cocktail dress featuring 175,000 crystals by Oscar de la Renta. unknown content item San Giorgio Maggiore is known for its gleaming marble Renaissance-era basilicas, designed by the Italian architect Andrea Palladio. But there may have been another, more pragmatic reason the couple opted for the island: privacy. After ongoing protests in the city — including the threat of canal blockades, guerilla-style banners and uncanny Bezos mannequins — allegedly forced Sanchez and Bezos to , the security and inaccessibility of the island was reportedly a key factor in their decision. Venice's Ministry of Tourism has estimated the celebrations will generate almost 68% of the city's annual tourism turnover in just one weekend — but protestors have rallied against what they perceive to be a takeover of the idyllic Italian archipelago city by some of the world's wealthiest people. During the ceremony, the Amazon-founder billionaire and the former journalist likely exchanged rings symbolically. It remains unclear when the couple legally wed (or if they already have, prior to this week, in the US). A spokesperson for the mayor's office in Venice had told CNN on Thursday that the city did not receive an official request from the couple, meaning the events this week are ceremonial and will not be legally binding. Shortly after the Vogue photos were released, Sanchez changed her Instagram account handle to Lauren Sanchez Bezos. Star-studded bash Before the celebration, Sanchez herself made her way to San Giorgio Maggiore dressed in a '60s-inspired tailored white skirt suit from Dior with a printed silk scarf wrapped Hepburn-style around her head, Jimmy Choo heels and an Hermès Kelly handbag. She blew kisses to photographers as she stepped into a water taxi. Guests have mingled all weekend wearing an array of luxury designers, including vintage Roberto Cavalli, Dolce & Gabbana, Oscar de la Renta and Versace. On the way to San Giorgio Maggiore, Kylie Jenner wore a powder blue long lace-up corset gown, Kim Kardashian chose a slick dark toffee-colored dress and Oprah opted for a draped pink mermaid silhouette. Though details of the wedding performers, like much else, were largely kept under wraps, Italian media reported that Matteo Bocelli — son of Andrea Bocelli, the revered Italian tenor who performed at both Kim and Kourtney Kardashian's weddings in 2014 and 2022, respectively — began the evening by singing “Can't Help Falling in Love” by Elvis Presley. And if Bocelli made guests misty-eyed, then Lady Gaga — reportedly set to close out the final day of festivities on Saturday — will no doubt bring the party. The pop mega-star is expected to perform at Venice's former medieval shipyard, the Arsenale — which has been modernized with cultural spaces and hosts the annual Venice Biennale.

Лорън разкрива също, че Джеф я е молил да я види в роклята, но както е традиция за повечето булки, тя обяснила, че няма да му позволи да я види до големия ден. „Почти се предадох“, признава тя. „Но искам да е изненада.

El viernes, el evento principal de la celebración de tres días de Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sanchez en Venecia culminó con una ceremonia privada en la histórica y apartada isla de San Giorgio Maggiore, en el sestiere de San Marco. Por la tarde, unos 200 invitados famosos –incluyendo a la familia Kardashian-Jenner, Bill Gates, Karlie Kloss, Oprah Winfrey y Usher– fueron fotografiados subiendo a taxis acuáticos rumbo a la fiesta, pero la visibilidad terminó ahí, ya que los asistentes aparentemente respetaron un acuerdo de no publicar en redes sociales durante los eventos. La ceremonia terminó discretamente, salvo por una señal del mundo de la moda: una portada digital de Vogue que ofreció el primer vistazo al vestido de Sanchez. Tras mucha especulación (y la presencia nada discreta del diseñador Domenico Dolce en Venecia), se confirmó que el vestido era un diseño a medida de Dolce & Gabbana, elaborado durante año y medio. El vestido, de encaje, cuello alto y corsé, tenía 180 botones forrados en gasa de seda. Durante la noche, según Vogue, Sanchez lució dos cambios de atuendo más: un vestido con escote corazón –inspirado en la película “Gilda” de 1946– para la cena, y un vestido de cóctel con 175.000 cristales de Oscar de la Renta. San Giorgio Maggiore es famosa por sus relucientes basílicas renacentistas de mármol, diseñadas por Andrea Palladio. Pero la pareja también eligió la isla por motivos de privacidad. Tras protestas en la ciudad –incluyendo amenazas de bloqueos de canales, pancartas y hasta maniquíes de Bezos–, supuestamente la pareja cambió uno de los lugares de la celebración a último momento, y la seguridad e inaccesibilidad de la isla fue clave en su decisión. El Ministerio de Turismo de Venecia estimó que las celebraciones generarán casi el 68 % de la facturación turística anual de la ciudad en un solo fin de semana, pero los manifestantes han protestado contra lo que consideran una “toma” de la ciudad por parte de los más ricos del mundo. Durante la ceremonia, el multimillonario fundador de Amazon y la experiodista probablemente intercambiaron anillos de manera simbólica. No está claro cuándo la pareja se casó legalmente (o si ya lo hicieron antes en EE. UU.) . Un portavoz de la alcaldía de Venecia dijo a CNN que la ciudad no recibió una solicitud oficial, por lo que los eventos de esta semana son ceremoniales y no tienen validez legal. Poco después de la publicación de las fotos de Vogue, Sanchez cambió su usuario de Instagram a Lauren Sanchez Bezos. Antes de la celebración, Sanchez llegó a San Giorgio Maggiore con un traje blanco de falda y chaqueta de Dior, inspirado en los años 60, un pañuelo de seda estampado al estilo Hepburn, tacones Jimmy Choo y un bolso Kelly de Hermès. Lanzó besos a los fotógrafos al subir al taxi acuático. Durante el fin de semana, los invitados lucieron prendas de lujo de firmas como Roberto Cavalli, Dolce & Gabbana, Oscar de la Renta y Versace. Camino a la isla, Kylie Jenner vistió un vestido azul claro con corsé, Kim Kardashian eligió un vestido color caramelo oscuro y Oprah optó por un diseño rosa drapeado estilo sirena. Aunque los detalles sobre los artistas invitados se mantuvieron en secreto, medios italianos informaron que Matteo Bocelli –hijo de Andrea Bocelli, quien cantó en las bodas de Kim y Kourtney Kardashian– abrió la noche interpretando “Can't Help Falling in Love” de Elvis Presley. Y si Bocelli emocionó a los presentes, Lady Gaga –quien, según se informa, cerrará este sábado el último día de festividades– seguramente pondrá a todos a bailar.

mov_AF5F7B3807C97A2671E431F8523DCFE6,2025-06-28 05:41:44,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Jeff Bezos, propietario de Amazon, ha sembrado de mal gusto y ostentación una de las ciudades con más historia y belleza de Europa: Venecia. Su boda, valorada en 50 millones de euros, demuestra que ni siquiera uno de los hombres más ricos del mundo puede comprarlo todo. La coyuntura no puede ser más cósmica: quién podía imaginar que los dos emperadores de Estados Unidos, el presidente Donald Trump y el propietario de Amazon, Jeff Bezos, pisarían el mismo suelo europeo en la misma semana. El primero acudió a La Haya para poner patas arriba la Cumbre de la OTAN en la que, según cuentan los análisis, casi todos le dieron a razón para que no cogiera una rabieta. El segundo ha querido casarse en la bella Venecia, parapetado en hoteles de siete estrellas y rodeado por marines disfrazados de guardaespaldas. Contemplar a estos dos hombres en acción es fascinante: tanto a Trump, creyendo que doblega con sus manotazos a los arteros diplomáticos europeos, como a Bezos, tirando besos y saludando como si fuera Beyoncé o Bad Bunny. Como si alguien le aclamara, vamos. Efectivamente, el emperador está desnudo y todas, al menos todas las que no hemos sido invitadas ni a la Cumbre de la OTAN ni a la boda en Venecia, podemos ver su ridiculez, más allá del maquillaje naranja de uno y la teatralidad extemporánea del otro. TAMBIÉN TE INTERESA Pongamos algunas cifras encima de la mesa que suscriben la mejor teoría leída hasta la fecha acerca de esta gran ceremonia imperial de Bezos: «Esta boda 'chonea'», dictaminó el diseñador Juan Avellaneda, desde hace tiempo árbitro de la elegancia desde su perfil de Instagram. Avellaneda encuadró a muchas de las invitadas en el estilo 'choni', aunque quizá sin conocer demasiado bien la gracia plebeya y desparpajo popular de una verdadera choni de barrio. Lo que estamos viendo en Venecia no son chonis (ya quisieran). Son, sencillamente, millonarias desesperadas. Desesperadas por parecerse a Sofía Loren. Vamos con las cifras. Ya lo sabemos: Jeff Bezos se ha gastado alrededor de 50 millones de euros para regalarle a su novia, la presentadora de televisión Lauren Sánchez (ganadora de un Emmy en 1999), una boda para recordar. Y Venecia la recordará, de hecho, como la ceremonia más sucia que jamás vio la ciudad de los canales: nueve enormes yates fondearon en el abarrotado puerto y 90 aviones privados esperan en el aeropuerto Marco Polo para devolver a sus propietarios allá donde deseen. Jeff Bezos quiso cerrar para él el centro de Venecia La ONG Consejo Internacional de Transporte Limpio ha calculado que generarán 5.000 toneladas de gases de efecto invernadero. Los novios pidieron a sus invitados que, en vez de regalos, hicieran donaciones a grupos ecologistas. Y, de hecho, muchos activistas han protestado de todas las maneras posibles por la irrupción de Bezos y Sánchez en Venecia y su intención de hacerse propietarios del lugar, cortando el tráfico aquí y allá, impidiendo el paso a los peatones, a golpe de talonario. Bezos ha logrado 'alquilar' Venecia solo en parte, pues se frustró su intención de casarse en un edificio histórico del centro de la ciudad. Tampoco tuvo suerte durante la esperada fiesta de la preboda del jueves: una tormenta bíblica hizo huir despavoridas y despeluchadas a las estrellas invitadas, que corrieron a sus lanchas para llegar a su hotel. Una venganza en toda regla de la Naturaleza que se celebró casi en cada hogar de la ciudad. Pese a las protestas, los memes en las redes y el lema «No Kings No Bezos» ('No a los reyes, no a Bezos', una adaptación del grito anti Trump) proyectado con láser en la plaza de San Marcos, los novios no han dado muestras de captar el rechazo popular. Parece que la novia declaró lo siguiente en la noche del diluvio: «Estoy viviendo un cuento de hadas, estoy en el séptimo cielo en una ciudad maravillosa, con el hombre que amo. No podría ser más feliz». El alcalde sí que ha de estar feliz: calculó que el enlace entre Lauren Sánchez y Jeff Bezos podría generar un impacto económico total de unos 957 millones de euros, incluida una gigante campaña de publicidad. Algunos artesanos locales (porque los novios regalaron a sus invitados una pieza de cristalería de Murano y dulces de la confiteria Rosa Salva), empresas de taxis y las grandes cadenas de hoteles se llevarán su parte, pero muy poco de todo ese dinero irá a parar a los bolsillos de los vecinos que han soportado el evento. Lauren Sánchez lucirá una veintea de looks de lujo Más números: se rumorea que Lauren Sánchez lucirá durante su estancia en Venecia 27 looks de alta costura, de los que de momento hemos visto un Schiaparelli apabullante. Al menos de frente, pues al ponerse de perfil el busto artificial de la novia deshace gran parte de su magia (Avellaneda dixit). ' The New York Times' publica que su estilista ha podido ser Anna Wintour, se supone que en su última comisión de servicio antes de abandonar la dirección de Vogue América, 37 años después. Suya pudo haber sido la idea de disfrazar a la novia de Jackie Kennedy con un look sesentero de Dior, horas antes de ponerse el traje de novia de Dolce & Gabbana. Pocos minutos después de que la novia dejara ver su vestido, Vogue lanzó en su website el reportaje del 'fitting' de Lauren Sánchez en el atelier de Dolce & Gabbana en Milán. «Me siento una princesa», exclamó al verse. Y desveló su inspiración, para sorpresa de nadie: el vestido de novia que lució Sofía Loren en 1958 para casarse con Cary Grant en la película Cintia (Houseboat). En la cena posterior, relata Vogue, la novia se puso un vestido inspirado en el que llevó Rita Hayworth en Gilda (1946). Y en la fiesta posterior, el protagonista fue un Oscar de la Renta con 175.000 cristales bordados. Si la preboda se celebró en los jardines de la iglesia del siglo XIV Madonna dell'Orto, con el clan Kardashian al completo imitando a Loren, Vitti o Bellucci sin ser nada de eso; la ceremonia tuvo lugar en el anfiteatro de mármol de la isla San Giorgio Maggiore, frente a la Plaza de San Marcos. Para esta cita, las invitadas VIP dieron el do de pecho del mal gusto. Aunque Jeff y Lauren pretendieron discreción para su enlace, las celebrities lucharon denodadamente por protagonizar la foto más viral gracias al look más desaforado. Las propuestas rosa de Ivanka Trump, Khloe Kardashian y Oprah Winfrey parecían salidas de los descartes de Barbie. Alicatadas con plumas, encajes y lentejuelas, debieron soportar más de 40 grados de calor los escasos minutos que pisaban las lanchas taxi. También sufrió la inclemencia veraniega Rania de Jordania, pero ella iba vestida con un Armani Privé de ensueño. Tras la ceremonia y cena, la gran fiesta final se celebrará hoy en el Arsenale, un enorme recinto fortificado que desde el siglo XII hasta la II Guerra Mundial se dedicó a la industria naval y militar con armerías y astilleros. El dress code exige máscaras del Settecento (el XVIII veneciano) y se rumorea, aunque nada puede confirmarse hasta que se produzca, que Lady Gaga y Elton John ofrecerán un concierto.

e3973d50173a13a82314a3b81d33bf73,2025-06-28 05:53:00,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Por Leah Dolan y Jacqui Palumbo, CNN Ha sido la boda más pública y a la vez más secreta del año. El viernes, el evento principal de la celebración de tres días de Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sanchez en Venecia culminó con una ceremonia privada en la histórica y apartada isla de San Giorgio Maggiore, en el sestiere de San Marco. Por la tarde, unos 200 invitados famosos –incluyendo a la familia Kardashian-Jenner, Bill Gates, Karlie Kloss, Oprah Winfrey y Usher– fueron fotografiados subiendo a taxis acuáticos rumbo a la fiesta, pero la visibilidad terminó ahí, ya que los asistentes aparentemente respetaron un acuerdo de no publicar en redes sociales durante los eventos. La ceremonia terminó discretamente, salvo por una señal del mundo de la moda: una portada digital de Vogue que ofreció el primer vistazo al vestido de Sanchez. Tras mucha especulación (y la presencia nada discreta del diseñador Domenico Dolce en Venecia), se confirmó que el vestido era un diseño a medida de Dolce & Gabbana, elaborado durante año y medio. El vestido, de encaje, cuello alto y corsé, tenía 180 botones forrados en gasa de seda. Durante la noche, según Vogue, Sanchez lució dos cambios de atuendo más: un vestido con escote corazón –inspirado en la película “Gilda” de 1946– para la cena, y un vestido de cóctel con 175.000 cristales de Oscar de la Renta. San Giorgio Maggiore es famosa por sus relucientes basílicas renacentistas de mármol, diseñadas por Andrea Palladio. Pero la pareja también eligió la isla por motivos de privacidad. Tras protestas en la ciudad –incluyendo amenazas de bloqueos de canales, pancartas y hasta maniquíes de Bezos–, supuestamente la pareja cambió uno de los lugares de la celebración a último momento, y la seguridad e inaccesibilidad de la isla fue clave en su decisión. El Ministerio de Turismo de Venecia estimó que las celebraciones generarán casi el 68 % de la facturación turística anual de la ciudad en un solo fin de semana, pero los manifestantes han protestado contra lo que consideran una “toma” de la ciudad por parte de los más ricos del mundo. Durante la ceremonia, el multimillonario fundador de Amazon y la experiodista probablemente intercambiaron anillos de manera simbólica. No está claro cuándo la pareja se casó legalmente (o si ya lo hicieron antes en EE. UU.) . Un portavoz de la alcaldía de Venecia dijo a CNN que la ciudad no recibió una solicitud oficial, por lo que los eventos de esta semana son ceremoniales y no tienen validez legal. Poco después de la publicación de las fotos de Vogue, Sanchez cambió su usuario de Instagram a Lauren Sanchez Bezos. Antes de la celebración, Sanchez llegó a San Giorgio Maggiore con un traje blanco de falda y chaqueta de Dior, inspirado en los años 60, un pañuelo de seda estampado al estilo Hepburn, tacones Jimmy Choo y un bolso Kelly de Hermès. Lanzó besos a los fotógrafos al subir al taxi acuático. Durante el fin de semana, los invitados lucieron prendas de lujo de firmas como Roberto Cavalli, Dolce & Gabbana, Oscar de la Renta y Versace. Camino a la isla, Kylie Jenner vistió un vestido azul claro con corsé, Kim Kardashian eligió un vestido color caramelo oscuro y Oprah optó por un diseño rosa drapeado estilo sirena. Aunque los detalles sobre los artistas invitados se mantuvieron en secreto, medios italianos informaron que Matteo Bocelli –hijo de Andrea Bocelli, quien cantó en las bodas de Kim y Kourtney Kardashian– abrió la noche interpretando “Can't Help Falling in Love” de Elvis Presley. Y si Bocelli emocionó a los presentes, Lady Gaga –quien, según se informa, cerrará este sábado el último día de festividades– seguramente pondrá a todos a bailar. Se espera que la estrella pop se presente en el antiguo astillero medieval de Venecia, el Arsenale, ahora convertido en espacio cultural y sede de la Bienal de Venecia.

Μια 3ήμερη φιέστα στο Μεγάλο Κανάλι της Βενετίας ολοκληρώθηκε την Παρασκευή όταν πια ο Μπέζος παντρεύτηκε τη Σάντσεζ με δόξα και τιμή. Την Παρασκευή, το κύριο γεγονός του τριήμερου βενετσιάνικου υπερθεάματος του Τζεφ Μπέζος και της Λόρεν Σάντσεζ κορυφώθηκε με μια ιδιωτική τελετή που πραγματοποιήθηκε στο απομονωμένο, ιστορικό νησί San Giorgio Maggiore στο sestiere San Marco. Το απόγευμα, τα περίπου 200 μέλη της λίστας των διάσημων καλεσμένων, μεταξύ των οποίων η οικογένεια Καρντάσιαν-Τζένερ, ο Μπιλ Γκέιτς, η Κάρλι Κλος, η Όπρα Γουίνφρι και ο Usher, φωτογραφήθηκαν όλοι να επιβιβάζονται σε θαλάσσια ταξί που τους μετέφεραν στις εορταστικές εκδηλώσεις, αλλά η προβολή τους έληγε αυτομάτως εκεί, με τους καλεσμένους να τηρούν ένα προφανές «μπλακ άουτ» στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης με το που πατούσαν το πόδι τους σε κάθε εκδήλωση του Σαββατοκύριακου. Το Dolce & Gabbana νυφικό Η τελετή έληξε διακριτικά, εκτός από ένα κλείσιμο του ματιού από τον κόσμο της μόδας – ένα ψηφιακό εξώφυλλο της Vogue που προσέφερε μια πρώτη ματιά στο φόρεμα της Σάντσεζ. Μετά από πολλές εικασίες (και όχι και τόσο διακριτικές εμφανίσεις του σχεδιαστή Domenico Dolce στη Βενετία), αποκαλύφθηκε ότι το φόρεμά της ήταν custom design από τους Dolce & Gabbana και ήταν ενάμιση χρόνο στα σκαριά. Το φόρεμα με τον ψηλό λαιμό από δαντέλα σε κορσέ είχε 180 ιερατικά κουμπιά καλυμμένα με μεταξωτό σιφόν στο μπροστινό μέρος. Κατά τη διάρκεια της βραδιάς, σύμφωνα με τη Vogue, η Σάντσεζ άλλαξε το νυφικό με ένα φόρεμα-αναφορά στην ταινία «Gilda» του 1946 και για το γαμήλιο δείπνο και ένα περίπλοκο κοκτέιλ φόρεμα με 175.000 κρύσταλλα του Oscar de la Renta. Η Κλοέ Καρντάσιαν φεύγει από το παλάτι Gritti, κατά τη δεύτερη ημέρα των γαμήλιων εκδηλώσεων του ιδρυτή της Amazon Τζεφ Μπέζος και της δημοσιογράφου Λόρεν Σάνσεζ, στη Βενετία της Ιταλίας, 27 Ιουνίου 2025.

REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane Το 68% του ετήσιου τουριστικού τζίρου Το San Giorgio Maggiore είναι γνωστό για τις αστραφτερές μαρμάρινες βασιλικές της αναγεννησιακής εποχής, σχεδιασμένες από τον Ιταλό αρχιτέκτονα Andrea Palladio. Αλλά ίσως υπήρχε και ένας άλλος λόγος που το ζευγάρι επέλεξε το νησί: η ιδιωτικότητα. Αφού οι συνεχιζόμενες διαμαρτυρίες στην πόλη – συμπεριλαμβανομένης της απειλής αποκλεισμού των καναλιών, τα πανό και οι κούκλες-μαριονέτες του Μπέζος και της Σάντσεζ- φέρεται να ανάγκασαν το ζεύγος να αλλάξει μια από τις τοποθεσίες του Σαββατοκύριακου την τελευταία στιγμή, η ασφάλεια και η μη προσβασιμότητα του νησιού φέρεται να ήταν βασικός παράγοντας στην απόφασή τους. Το Υπουργείο Τουρισμού της Βενετίας έχει εκτιμήσει ότι οι εορτασμοί θα αποφέρουν σχεδόν το 68% του ετήσιου τουριστικού τζίρου της πόλης σε ένα μόνο Σαββατοκύριακο – αλλά οι διαδηλωτές έχουν συγκεντρωθεί εναντίον αυτού που θεωρούν ότι αποτελεί κατάληψη της ειδυλλιακής πόλης του ιταλικού αρχιπελάγους από μερικούς από τους πλουσιότερους ανθρώπους του κόσμου. Βιτόρια Σερέτι. REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane Η Μπρους Ναντίρ στο βαπορέτο. REUTERS/Yara Nardi Τελετουργικός γάμος κι όχι νομικός Κατά τη διάρκεια της τελετής, ο δισεκατομμυριούχος ιδρυτής της Amazon και η πρώην δημοσιογράφος πιθανότατα αντάλλαξαν συμβολικά δαχτυλίδια. Παραμένει ασαφές πότε το ζευγάρι θα παντρευτεί νόμιμα (ή αν το έχει ήδη κάνει, πριν από αυτή την εβδομάδα, στις ΗΠΑ). Εκπρόσωπος του γραφείου του δημάρχου της Βενετίας είχε δηλώσει στο CNN την Πέμπτη ότι η πόλη δεν έλαβε επίσημο αίτημα από το ζευγάρι, πράγμα που σημαίνει ότι οι εκδηλώσεις αυτής της εβδομάδας είναι τελετουργικές και δεν θα είναι νομικά δεσμευτικές. Λίγο μετά τη δημοσίευση των φωτογραφιών της Vogue, η Σάντσεζ άλλαξε το όνομα του λογαριασμού της στο Instagram σε Λόρεν Σάντσεζ Μπέζος. Κέντακ και Κάιλι Τζένερ. REUTERS/Manuel Silvestri Πάρτι με αστέρια Πριν από τη γιορτή, η ίδια η Σάντσεζ πήγε στο San Giorgio Maggiore ντυμένη με ένα λευκό κοστούμι με φούστα του Dior, εμπνευσμένο από τη δεκαετία του '60, με ένα μεταξωτό μαντήλι τυλιγμένο στο κεφάλι της σε στυλ Χέπμπορν, γόβες Jimmy Choo και μια τσάντα Hermès Kelly. Έστειλε φιλιά στους φωτογράφους καθώς έμπαινε σε ένα θαλάσσιο ταξί. Οι καλεσμένοι κυκλοφόρησαν ανέμελοι όλο το Σαββατοκύριακο φορώντας μια σειρά από πολυτελείς σχεδιαστές, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των vintage Roberto Cavalli, Dolce & Gabbana, Oscar de la Renta και Versace. Στο δρόμο προς το San Giorgio Maggiore, η Κάιλι Τζένερ φόρεσε ένα μπλε της πούδρας μακρύ φόρεμα με κορσέ και δαντέλα, η Κιμ Καρντάσιαν επέλεξε ένα κομψό φόρεμα σε σκούρο χρώμα καραμέλας και η Όπρα Γουίνφρι επέλεξε μια ντραπέ ροζ γοργονέ σιλουέτα. Κιμ Καρντάσιαν. REUTERS/Guglielmo Mangiapane Lady Gaga και Έλτον Τζον Αν και οι λεπτομέρειες για τους καλλιτέχνες του γάμου, όπως και πολλά άλλα, κρατήθηκαν σε μεγάλο βαθμό μυστικές, τα ιταλικά μέσα ενημέρωσης ανέφεραν ότι ο Ματέο Μποτσέλι – γιος του Αντρέα Μποτσέλι, του σεβαστού Ιταλού τενόρου που τραγούδησε στους γάμους της Κιμ και της Κόρτνεϊ Καρντάσιαν το 2014 και το 2022, αντίστοιχα – άνοιξε τη βραδιά τραγουδώντας το «Can't Help Falling in Love» του Έλβις Πρίσλεϊ. Ο Μποτσέλι έκανε τους καλεσμένους να βουρκώσουν και η Lady Gaga με τον Έλτον Τζον -που σύμφωνα με πληροφορίες έκλεισαν την τελευταία ημέρα των γαμήλιων εορταστικών εκδηλώσεων- τους ξεσήκωσαν για το πάρτι. Οι δύο ποπ μεγα-σταρ λέγεται ότι εμφανίστηκαν στο πρώην μεσαιωνικό ναυπηγείο της Βενετίας, το Arsenale – το οποίο έχει εκσυγχρονιστεί σε πολιτιστικός χώρος και φιλοξενεί την ετήσια Μπιενάλε της Βενετίας. *Με στοιχεία από cnn.com"

趙怡賢自出演《殭屍校園》獲得廣大關注後，2025年再度以《牽牛和仙女》成為熱度女星，趙怡賢在《牽牛和仙女》劇中飾演白天是高中生，晚上是巫師的18歲少女，她對初戀的一見鍾情毫不扭捏，勇敢面對命運與詛咒，成為不少女性觀眾心中的新一代戀愛女主代表。 來看看趙怡賢私下的妝容有多美～
趙怡賢私下喜歡偏水光感的唇妝，溫柔又不失存在感

Đây là khu vực khó tiếp cận, canh phòng an ninh nghiêm ngặt, không có hình ảnh nào bên trong rò rỉ ra bên ngoài. Khách mời cũng được yêu cầu không được đăng gì lên mạng xã hội. Sau khi lễ thành hôn kết thúc, cô dâu chia sẻ ảnh cưới đầu tiên lên Instagram. Theo truyền thông Mỹ, nữ MC xóa sổ tài khoản Instagram cũ và thay thế bằng tài khoản mới có tên Lauren Sánchez Bezos, như để công bố thân phận mới cho thế giới. Tài khoản này đạt mốc một triệu người theo dõi chỉ sau vài tiếng. Ảnh: Vogue. Tờ báo được độc quyền đăng tải hình ảnh về hôn lễ thế kỷ này là Vogue, với dòng tiêu đề: ""Cô dâu đến rồi!

Theo Vogue, nữ MC đeo đôi hoa tai Dolce & Gabbana Alta Gioielleria Miracolo có bốn viên kim cương được cắt từ một viên đá duy nhất và khảm vàng trắng. Ảnh: Vogue. Lauren Sánchez cho biết trang phục lấy cảm hứng từ váy cưới ren cổ cao mà Sophia Loren khi kết hôn trong bộ phim Houseboat năm 1958. “Ý tưởng chuyển từ 'Tôi muốn chiếc váy hiện đại, gợi cảm, đơn giản' thành 'Tôi muốn thứ gì đó gợi lên khoảnh khắc' và nơi tôi đang ở hiện tại. Tôi khác so với 5 năm trước. Tôi nghiên cứu hình ảnh cô dâu vào những năm 1950 và tôi thấy Sophia Loren… Thế là xong. Đó là chiếc váy tôi muốn”, nhà báo 6X nói. Ảnh: Vogue. Vogue cho biết đó không phải bộ cánh duy nhất của cô dâu trong lễ cưới. Bà Bezos sau đó thay chiếc váy lấy cảm hứng từ bộ phim Gilda của Rita Hayworth và váy cocktail của Oscar de la Renta.

22d333dd5de4f1c45441cb89fb9c1e4d,2025-06-28 08:13:00,ru,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[ru]Основатель Amazon Джефф Безос и журналистка Лорен Санчес устроили пышную свадьбу на острове Сан-Джорджо-Маджоре в Венеции, на которую пригласили более 200 VIP-гостей. Как сообщает CNN, празднование, которое продлится три дня, началось в пятницу, 27 июня 2025 года, и стоило, по оценкам, от 40 до 48 миллионов евро ($46,5-55,6 млн). Лорен Санчес прибыла на остров на водном такси за несколько часов до церемонии, одетая в элегантный кремовый шелковый костюм от Dior, дополненный шелковым платком на голове и солнцезащитными очками. Позже она сменила наряд на платье от Dolce & Gabbana для самой церемонии. Санчес заказала 27 нарядов для трехдневного празднования. Джефф Безос прибыл на остров в черном смокинге, сопровождаемый около 200 гостями. Накануне, в четверг, гости собрались на торжественное событие в средневековой церкви Мадонна дель Орто, где хранятся работы венецианского художника Тинторетто. Мэрия Венеции издала распоряжение об ограничении пешеходного движения вокруг собора XIV века от позднего послеобеденного времени до полуночи. По условиям организации мероприятия гости соблюдали ограничения по публикациям в социальных сетях, и в их аккаунтах появлялись лишь единичные фото города и упоминания о неблагоприятной погоде. Несмотря на масштабность событий, неизвестно, официально ли пара заключила брак, или церемония в Венеции является лишь символической. Представитель мэрии Венеции сообщил CNN, что официального запроса на регистрацию брака от Безоса и Санчес не поступало, поэтому события этой недели имеют церемониальный характер, а не юридическую силу. Празднования, которые продлятся до субботы, 28 июня, объединили около 200 гостей, которые отмечают союз миллиардера и бывшей журналистки после двух лет помолвки. По словам советника по туризму Венеции Симоне Вентурини, город ожидает экономический эффект от свадьбы и сопутствующих мероприятий в размере 20-30 миллионов евро ($23,4-35,1 млн).

Der Milliardär und die ehemalige Reporterin haben in Venedig inmitten einer Woche der Proteste in der Stadt den Bund fürs Leben geschlossen. Bezos und Sánchez haben sich 2023 verlobt, mehr als vier Jahre nachdem ihre Beziehung öffentlich wurde. Einer der reichsten Männer der Welt ist offiziell vom Markt. Am Freitag haben Jeff Bezos und Lauren Sánchez in einer aufwendigen Zeremonie in Venedig geheiratet, wie die Braut in einem Instagram-Post bestätigte. 200-köpfige Promi-Gästeliste Sie waren von rund 200 Gästen umgeben, darunter so reiche und mächtige Leute wie Kim Kardashian, Bill Gates und Ivanka Trump. Der 61-jährige Bezos und die 55-jährige Sánchez heirateten fast zwei Jahre nach der Bekanntgabe ihrer Verlobung. Hochzeit aufgrund von Protesten verschoben Im März bestätigte der Bürgermeister von Venedig, Luigi Brugnaro, in einer Erklärung, dass das Paar in Venedig heiraten würde. Bezos und Sánchez wurden im Vorfeld ihres großen Tages auch mehrfach in Italien gesichtet. Wie „People“ berichtete, sollte die Zeremonie ursprünglich am Samstag stattfinden, wurde aber aufgrund von Sicherheitsbedenken und Protesten in der Stadt auf Freitag verlegt. Demonstranten gingen im Vorfeld der Hochzeit auf die Straße und äußerten ihre Besorgnis darüber, dass die Hochzeit zum Übertourismus in Venedig beitrage und den Einheimischen nicht zugutekäme. Ein Vertreter von Bezos und Sánchez reagierte nicht auf eine Presseanfrage von Business Insider. Standortwechsel: Insel San Giorgio Maggiore Das Paar heiratete schließlich auf der venezianischen Insel San Giorgio Maggiore und fuhr mit separaten Wassertaxis zur Zeremonie. Sánchez trug ein cremefarbenes Set von Dior, als sie sich am frühen Abend auf den Weg zum Veranstaltungsort machte. Nach der Zeremonie enthüllte sie in einem Instagram-Post ihr Hochzeitskleid, änderte ihren Namen in „Lauren Sánchez Bezos“ und löschte auf ihrem Profil alles außer einem Hochzeitsfoto. Sánchez' Spitzenkleid, entworfen von Dolce & Gabbana, hatte einen hohen Ausschnitt, Knöpfe in der Mitte und einen Meerjungfrauen-Rock. Ein bodenlanger Schleier vervollständigte ihr Ensemble. Bezos trug bei der Hochzeit einen traditionellen Smoking. 2019 wurde die Beziehung öffentlich Die Beziehung von Bezos und Sánchez wurde im Januar 2019 öffentlich, kurz nachdem Bezos und seine Ex-Frau MacKenzie Scott ihre Scheidung bekannt gegeben hatten. Sánchez war zu diesem Zeitpunkt mit Patrick Whitesell verheiratet, die beiden reichten jedoch im April 2019 die Scheidung ein. Bezos und Sánchez traten im Juli 2019 zum ersten Mal als Paar in Erscheinung und haben sich in den vergangenen Jahren zu einer festen Größe in Promi– und Geschäftskreisen entwickelt. Im Mai 2023 wurde erstmals berichtet, dass sich Bezos und Sánchez verlobt haben."

Tras casarse civilmente en Estados Unidos, la pareja celebró durante tres días un enlace de ensueño que convirtió la ciudad italiana en un gigantesco escenario de lujo y espectáculo. La ceremonia principal tuvo lugar el 27 de junio en la isla de San Giorgio Maggiore, frente a la basílica, un enclave exclusivo al que llegaron más de 200 invitados internacionales en lanchas privadas. Entre ellos destacaron rostros tan conocidos como Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey, las hermanas Kardashian, Tom Brady, Orlando Bloom, la reina Rania de Jordania y Mick Jagger. Lauren Sánchez deslumbró con un vestido blanco de encaje diseñado por Dolce & Gabbana, con corte sirena, cuello alto, manga larga y una hilera de delicados botones de perla en la espalda. El look, rematado con un velo bordado de aire clásico, evocó el glamour de las divas italianas del cine como Sophia Loren. Sánchez, de 55 años, llevó nada menos que 27 vestidos distintos a lo largo de las celebraciones, todos ellos de firmas de alta costura como Schiaparelli, Dior y Alaïa. Según trascendió, la editora de Vogue, Anna Wintour, asesoró personalmente a la novia en la selección de los modelos, siguiendo el lema de “elegancia máxima, sin miedo al exceso”. Instagram de Lauren Sánchez El magnate de Amazon, por su parte, apostó por la sobriedad con un esmoquin negro de Dolce & Gabbana en la ceremonia, combinándolo en otras fiestas con trajes blancos y chaquetas de terciopelo. Los festejos se extendieron durante todo el fin de semana e incluyeron una foam party en un superyate, una fiesta de máscaras en el Arsenal veneciano y un exclusivo banquete al estilo “Gran Gatsby” en un palacete del Gran Canal. La música corrió a cargo de Matteo Bocelli, hijo del tenor Andrea Bocelli, que interpretó “Can't Help Falling in Love” y otras piezas románticas. También actuó un coro góspel que hizo vibrar a los invitados con una versión de “Higher Love”. Instagram de Lauren Sánchez El evento estuvo rodeado de estrictas medidas de seguridad: se cerraron al público varios espacios del centro histórico, se bloquearon zonas de atraque para embarcaciones privadas y los asistentes debieron entregar sus móviles para evitar filtraciones de imágenes. Hoteles como el Aman Venice fueron reservados en exclusiva, con suites de hasta 8.000 euros la noche, mientras que en la ciudad se contaron hasta 90 jets privados procedentes de todo el mundo. Aunque Bezos y Sánchez solicitaron a sus invitados que, en lugar de regalos, realizaran donaciones para la restauración de edificios históricos y proyectos vinculados a la Universidad Ca' Foscari, la boda despertó también fuertes críticas. Asociaciones vecinales y colectivos ecologistas denunciaron el impacto ambiental del evento y la invasión del turismo de lujo en una ciudad que sufre desde hace años la saturación de visitantes. Algunos residentes definieron la boda como “un derroche obsceno que convirtió Venecia en un parque temático privado para millonarios”, mientras que desde el consistorio se defendió que el acontecimiento generaría importantes beneficios para la economía local. Activistas protestan en la Plaza de San Marcos. Fotografía: Cortesía EFE Con un coste estimado entre 30 y 55 millones de euros, la boda de Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sánchez marcó un nuevo hito en la historia de los enlaces de celebridades, combinando la moda más exclusiva, gestos de filantropía, y un despliegue de medios nunca antes visto en la ciudad de los canales. Un enlace que, para bien o para mal, dejó claro el inmenso poder mediático y económico de uno de los hombres más ricos del mundo y de su ya esposa, convertida ahora en la flamante Lauren Sánchez Bezos."
mov_311FFBAFD33405951E94E8D6ECAD92E5,2025-06-28 09:55:06,en,WEB,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Kim and Khloe Kardashian were among the first celebrity guests to leave Venice on Saturday morning after Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding. A host of Hollywood's biggest stars flocked to the northern Italian city this week for the wedding of the Amazon billionaire, 61, and his journalist partner, 55. The couple tied the knot on Friday evening in front of nearly 200 VIPs including Leonardo Di Caprio, Orlando Bloom and Tom Brady, on San Maggiore island. Following the 'wedding of the century', guests attended a star-studded party which went onto the early hours of Saturday morning. But Kim, 44, and Khloe, 41, were snapped making a swift exit from the $20million affair by boat as they bailed early, and once again, the Kardashians didn't waste any time leaving Venice on Saturday despite festivities being far from over. The sisters were spotted wearing casual ensembles as they made a low-key exit from the Italian city, presumably to board a private flight back to Los Angeles. SKIMS owner Kim showed off her incredible figure in figure-hugging black leggings and a fitted grey bandeau top, while she sported a pair of aviator shades. Meanwhile, Khloe, also covering her eyes with a pair of shades, cut a trendy figure in an all-black ensemble along with a jacket. Their mother Kris, 69, and sisters Kendall, 29, and Kylie, 27, were nowhere in sight as the duo headed out of Venice, as they appeared to be staying in the city for longer. The celebrations are far from over as the festivities are slated to continue at the Arsenale di Venezia on Saturday night. Their departure came after they made an early exit from the wedding afterparty on Friday night, with their supermodel sister Kendall, 29, following shortly after. They were spotted departing the star-studded rave by boat, captured in stylish photos set against the breath-taking backdrop of Italian architecture. Fans were eagerly awaiting to see what the Kardashian sisters would wear to the festivities, and they certainly pulled out all the stops on the night. Kylie displayed her enviable curves in a figure-hugging silver corset dress and a pair of stylish sunglasses. However, she came under fire from some fans who pointed out that her dress looked very close to white in certain lighting. Kylie risked Lauren's wrath with the bold choice since traditionally, white is the color reserved for the bride - and guests are usually urged to steer clear of any colour that may even appear close in order to avoid confusion or steal the spotlight. She was pictured boarding a boat taxi with her sister Kendall, who looked elegant in a black ensemble, on their way to the wedding. Meanwhile, Kim's outfit was however blasted as 'basic and boring' by fans, as the reality star slipped into a shiny black gown with laser-cut trimmings on its sides. The wedding, held two years after Jeff proposed to Lauren aboard his $500million superyacht, was described as 'extremely intimate' with a strict no-phone policy - with around 70 of the 200 guests being family members. The only images that emerged of the nuptials came via Lauren's official Instagram account - and photos of guests leaving the night-time celebrations were scarce. Jeff and Lauren are thought to have splashed out a staggering $20million on their multiple-day extravagant wedding bash. As guests arrived at the reception on Friday, they were welcomed by the stirring sounds of trumpets, violins, and a soulful Gospel choir. That same choir returned to belt out Whitney Houston's Higher Love right after the couple exchanged their vows, with guests cheering and singing along during the heartfelt moment. Opera singer Matteo Bocelli kicked off the wedding reception with a touching tribute, opening his set with the timeless Elvis Presley classic I Can't Help Falling in Love With You. The son of renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli stepped in since his father was tied up with concerts in southern Italy over the weekend. Earlier in the day, award-winning journalist Sanchez made a chic first appearance, stepping out of the five-star Aman Hotel in a sophisticated white Dior puff-sleeve suit, perfectly accessorized with a headscarf and oversized sunglasses. In the photographs, she flashed a dazzling new giant diamond ring that caught plenty of attention. It was revealed ahead of the nuptials that Jeff and Lauren had already legally tied the knot before today's official ceremony on San Giorgio Maggiore island. The star-studded celebrations kicked off Thursday evening with a lavish welcome dinner at the Campo Della Madonna dell'Orto. However, the billionaire couple and their A-list entourage had to seek shelter when a sudden thunderstorm rolled in during the pre-wedding party. Lauren wowed in a shimmering $100,000 gown by Daniel Roseberry, featuring intricate embroidery of swirling vines and florals in rich blue, green, and gold tones over a champagne-colored base. To mark the grand occasion, the couple reportedly rented out multiple locations around the city. An insider told DailyMail.com last week that San Giorgio Maggiore island is essentially 'off-limits to visitors' from June 24 through June 29. Originally, a massive party was scheduled for Saturday night at the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, but local media report it has since been relocated to another venue in the Arsenale district."

Το απόγευμα, τα περίπου 200 μέλη της λίστας των διάσημων καλεσμένων, μεταξύ των οποίων η οικογένεια Καρντάσιαν-Τζένερ, ο Μπιλ Γκέιτς, η Κάρλι Κλος, η Όπρα Γουίνφρι και ο Usher, φωτογραφήθηκαν όλοι να επιβιβάζονται σε θαλάσσια ταξί που τους μετέφεραν στις εορταστικές εκδηλώσεις, αλλά η προβολή τους έληγε αυτομάτως εκεί, με τους καλεσμένους να τηρούν ένα προφανές «μπλακ άουτ» στα μέσα κοινωνικής δικτύωσης με το που πατούσαν το πόδι τους σε κάθε εκδήλωση του Σαββατοκύριακου. [embedded content] Το Dolce & Gabbana νυφικό Η τελετή έληξε διακριτικά, εκτός από ένα κλείσιμο του ματιού από τον κόσμο της μόδας – ένα ψηφιακό εξώφυλλο της Vogue που προσέφερε μια πρώτη ματιά στο φόρεμα της Σάντσεζ. Μετά από πολλές εικασίες (και όχι και τόσο διακριτικές εμφανίσεις του σχεδιαστή Domenico Dolce στη Βενετία), αποκαλύφθηκε ότι το φόρεμά της ήταν custom design από τους Dolce & Gabbana και ήταν ενάμιση χρόνο στα σκαριά. Το φόρεμα με τον ψηλό λαιμό από δαντέλα σε κορσέ είχε 180 ιερατικά κουμπιά καλυμμένα με μεταξωτό σιφόν στο μπροστινό μέρος. Κατά τη διάρκεια της βραδιάς, σύμφωνα με τη Vogue, η Σάντσεζ άλλαξε το νυφικό με ένα φόρεμα-αναφορά στην ταινία «Gilda» του 1946 και για το γαμήλιο δείπνο και ένα περίπλοκο κοκτέιλ φόρεμα με 175.000 κρύσταλλα του Oscar de la Renta. Το 68% του ετήσιου τουριστικού τζίρου Το San Giorgio Maggiore είναι γνωστό για τις αστραφτερές μαρμάρινες βασιλικές της αναγεννησιακής εποχής, σχεδιασμένες από τον Ιταλό αρχιτέκτονα Andrea Palladio. Αλλά ίσως υπήρχε και ένας άλλος λόγος που το ζευγάρι επέλεξε το νησί: η ιδιωτικότητα. Αφού οι συνεχιζόμενες διαμαρτυρίες στην πόλη – συμπεριλαμβανομένης της απειλής αποκλεισμού των καναλιών, τα πανό και οι κούκλες-μαριονέτες του Μπέζος και της Σάντσεζ- φέρεται να ανάγκασαν το ζεύγος να αλλάξει μια από τις τοποθεσίες του Σαββατοκύριακου την τελευταία στιγμή, η ασφάλεια και η μη προσβασιμότητα του νησιού φέρεται να ήταν βασικός παράγοντας στην απόφασή τους. Το Υπουργείο Τουρισμού της Βενετίας έχει εκτιμήσει ότι οι εορτασμοί θα αποφέρουν σχεδόν το 68% του ετήσιου τουριστικού τζίρου της πόλης σε ένα μόνο Σαββατοκύριακο – αλλά οι διαδηλωτές έχουν συγκεντρωθεί εναντίον αυτού που θεωρούν ότι αποτελεί κατάληψη της ειδυλλιακής πόλης του ιταλικού αρχιπελάγους από μερικούς από τους πλουσιότερους ανθρώπους του κόσμου. Τελετουργικός γάμος κι όχι νομικός Κατά τη διάρκεια της τελετής, ο δισεκατομμυριούχος ιδρυτής της Amazon και η πρώην δημοσιογράφος πιθανότατα αντάλλαξαν συμβολικά δαχτυλίδια. Παραμένει ασαφές πότε το ζευγάρι θα παντρευτεί νόμιμα (ή αν το έχει ήδη κάνει, πριν από αυτή την εβδομάδα, στις ΗΠΑ). Εκπρόσωπος του γραφείου του δημάρχου της Βενετίας είχε δηλώσει στο CNN την Πέμπτη ότι η πόλη δεν έλαβε επίσημο αίτημα από το ζευγάρι, πράγμα που σημαίνει ότι οι εκδηλώσεις αυτής της εβδομάδας είναι τελετουργικές και δεν θα είναι νομικά δεσμευτικές. Λίγο μετά τη δημοσίευση των φωτογραφιών της Vogue, η Σάντσεζ άλλαξε το όνομα του λογαριασμού της στο Instagram σε Λόρεν Σάντσεζ Μπέζος. Πάρτι με αστέρια Πριν από τη γιορτή, η ίδια η Σάντσεζ πήγε στο San Giorgio Maggiore ντυμένη με ένα λευκό κοστούμι με φούστα του Dior, εμπνευσμένο από τη δεκαετία του '60, με ένα μεταξωτό μαντήλι τυλιγμένο στο κεφάλι της σε στυλ Χέπμπορν, γόβες Jimmy Choo και μια τσάντα Hermès Kelly. Έστειλε φιλιά στους φωτογράφους καθώς έμπαινε σε ένα θαλάσσιο ταξί. Οι καλεσμένοι κυκλοφόρησαν ανέμελοι όλο το Σαββατοκύριακο φορώντας μια σειρά από πολυτελείς σχεδιαστές, συμπεριλαμβανομένων των vintage Roberto Cavalli, Dolce & Gabbana, Oscar de la Renta και Versace. Στο δρόμο προς το San Giorgio Maggiore, η Κάιλι Τζένερ φόρεσε ένα μπλε της πούδρας μακρύ φόρεμα με κορσέ και δαντέλα, η Κιμ Καρντάσιαν επέλεξε ένα κομψό φόρεμα σε σκούρο χρώμα καραμέλας και η Όπρα Γουίνφρι επέλεξε μια ντραπέ ροζ γοργονέ σιλουέτα. Lady Gaga και Έλτον Τζον Αν και οι λεπτομέρειες για τους καλλιτέχνες του γάμου, όπως και πολλά άλλα, κρατήθηκαν σε μεγάλο βαθμό μυστικές, τα ιταλικά μέσα ενημέρωσης ανέφεραν ότι ο Ματέο Μποτσέλι – γιος του Αντρέα Μποτσέλι, του σεβαστού Ιταλού τενόρου που τραγούδησε στους γάμους της Κιμ και της Κόρτνεϊ Καρντάσιαν το 2014 και το 2022, αντίστοιχα – άνοιξε τη βραδιά τραγουδώντας το «Can't Help Falling in Love» του Έλβις Πρίσλεϊ. Ο Μποτσέλι έκανε τους καλεσμένους να βουρκώσουν και η Lady Gaga με τον Έλτον Τζον -που σύμφωνα με πληροφορίες έκλεισαν την τελευταία ημέρα των γαμήλιων εορταστικών εκδηλώσεων- τους ξεσήκωσαν για το πάρτι. Οι δύο ποπ μεγα-σταρ λέγεται ότι εμφανίστηκαν στο πρώην μεσαιωνικό ναυπηγείο της Βενετίας, το Arsenale – το οποίο έχει εκσυγχρονιστεί σε πολιτιστικός χώρος και φιλοξενεί την ετήσια Μπιενάλε της Βενετίας. *Με στοιχεία από cnn.com"

mov_319BA2A6805800896332E2FFA1AD01F4,2025-06-28 10:52:13,en,WEB,"  In a highly publicized yet secretive ceremony, Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez celebrated their union in Venice. The exclusive event on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore, drew a star-studded guest list. The wedding, marked by luxury and a touch of defiance, has captivated the world. A Private Ceremony on a Historic Island The highlight of a three-day celebration, the wedding took place on Friday. Approximately 200 notable guests were photographed arriving via water taxis. However, attendees reportedly agreed to a social media blackout during the festivities. The island of San Giorgio Maggiore, renowned for its Renaissance architecture, was chosen by the couple for its privacy. The bride's custom-made Dolce & Gabbana gown, with its high neck and corset, was a fashion statement. It took a year and a half to create and featured 180 silk-gauze-lined buttons. Celebrity Attendees and Fashion Forward Choices Guests like the Kardashian-Jenner family, Bill Gates, and Oprah Winfrey graced the event. Sanchez sported several outfit changes, including a gown inspired by the film “Gilda” and an Oscar de la Renta cocktail dress. Before the ceremony, Sanchez was seen in a 1960s-inspired ensemble by Dior, paired with a silk headscarf and Jimmy Choo heels. The Wedding's Aftermath and City's Reaction Following the Vogue digital cover, Sanchez updated her Instagram handle to Lauren Sanchez Bezos. The wedding's impact on the city was significant, sparking discussions about tourism and wealth. The Ministry of Tourism in Venice estimated that the celebrations would generate almost 68% of the city's annual tourist revenue within a single weekend. The wedding's opulence has sparked some controversy. Protests were held, including threats of channel blockades and banners. Critics have voiced concerns about the “takeover” of the city by the wealthy. Venice has a long history of tourism, with around 30 million visitors annually as of 2019, according to Statista, an online portal for market data. A ship transports the wedding attendees to San Giorgio Maggiore on June 27, 2025. The ceremony was primarily symbolic, with no legal validity confirmed by the city. It is not clear whether a legal marriage took place beforehand. Musical Performances and Final Revelations Matteo Bocelli, son of Andrea Bocelli, kicked off the evening's entertainment. He performed “Can't Help Falling in Love.” Lady Gaga was expected to close out the final day's festivities. Related"

Pernikahan pendiri Amazon itu digelar secara privat di pulau terpencil bersejarah San Giorgio Maggiore di sestiere San Marco. Dikutip dari CNN Internasional, sekitar 200 tamu selebritas, termasuk keluarga Kim Kardashian – Kylie Jenner, Bill Gates, Karlie Kloss, Oprah Winfrey, dan Usher menaiki speed boat menuju ke tempat perayaan pada Jumat sore (27/6). Pernikahan Jeff Bezos di Protes Warga Proses pernikahan Jeff Bezos dan Lauren Sanchez digelar tiga hari, dengan puncak acara dilakukan pada Jumat (27/6). Bezos melambaikan tangan dari speedboat saat ia dan Sanchez tiba pada Rabu (25/6) di dermaga Aman Hotel, hotel bintang lima di Grand Canal, dengan dua perahu keamanan di belakangnya. Dikutip dari Al Jazeera, acara pernikahan mewah itu menuai protes oleh kelompok-kelompok yang menganggapnya sebagai tanda kesenjangan yang makin lebar antara si kaya dan si miskin. Warga sekitar juga mengeluhkan acara pernikahan pendiri Amazon dan mantan jurnalis itu, karena menjadi contoh bagaimana kebutuhan mereka diabaikan di era pariwisata massal ke kota laguna yang bersejarah dan ikonik tersebut. Sekitar selusin organisasi Venesia, termasuk pendukung perumahan, aktivis anti-kapal pesiar, dan kelompok universitas, bersatu untuk memprotes acara tersebut. Mereka menamakan aksi dengan 'tidak ada ruang untuk Bezos', plesetan kata yang juga merujuk pada penerbangan luar angkasa sang pengantin perempuan baru-baru ini. Mereka menggelar protes skala kecil, membentangkan spanduk anti-Bezos di situs-situs ikonik Venesia. Mereka bergabung dengan Greenpeace dan kelompok Inggris 'Everyone Hates Elon' untuk membentangkan spanduk raksasa di Lapangan Santo Markus yang memprotes keringanan pajak bagi para miliarder. Pada Rabu (25/6), aktivis lainnya meluncurkan pelampung di Grand Canal yang menampilkan manekin Bezos yang berpegangan pada kotak Amazon, tangannya penuh dengan dolar palsu. Perusahaan publisitas Inggris yang mengumumkan aksi tersebut mengatakan bahwa itu bukan protes terhadap pernikahan. “Ini protes terhadap kekayaan yang tidak terkendali, kontrol media, dan privatisasi ruang publik yang semakin meningkat,” demikian dikutip dari Al Jazeera. Kementerian Pariwisata Venesia memperkirakan perayaan tersebut menghasilkan hampir 68% dari omzet pariwisata tahunan kota itu hanya dalam satu akhir pekan. Akan tetapi, para pengunjuk rasa menganggap acara itu sebagai pengambilalihan kota kepulauan Italia oleh beberapa orang terkaya di dunia. Tamu Dilarang Unggah Acara Pernikahan Jeff Bezos ke Media Sosial Orang lain selain tamu undangan tidak bisa memasuki area pernikahan Jeff Bezos dan Lauren Sanchez. Para tamu juga diminta mematuhi larangan mengunggah prosesi maupun lokasi ke media sosial. Upacara berakhir dengan diam-diam, namun Vogue mengunggah fesyen para tamu yang hadir dalam acara pernikahan Jeff Bezos dan Lauren Sanchez. Tak lama setelah foto Vogue dirilis, Sanchez mengubah nama akun Instagramnya menjadi Lauren Sanchez Bezos. Pernikahan Jeff Bezos Bertabur Artis Sebelum perayaan, Sanchez berjalan sendiri ke San Giorgio Maggiore mengenakan setelan rok putih bergaya tahun 60-an dari Dior, dipadupadankan syal sutra bermotif yang dililitkan di kepala dengan gaya Hepburn, sepatu hak Jimmy Choo, dan tas tangan Hermès Kelly. Ia memberikan kecupan kepada para fotografer saat ia melangkah ke dalam speedboat. Para tamu berbaur sepanjang akhir pekan dengan mengenakan berbagai rancangan desainer mewah, termasuk Roberto Cavalli, Dolce and Gabbana, Oscar de la Renta, dan Versace.

mov_A429AEC32A73FEEB3D8BCA5526CA946B,2025-06-28 11:26:58,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]El abad de la isla de San Giorgio, donde tuvo lugar el enlace con una fiesta hasta el amanecer, critica la “excesiva mundanidad” del evento. Todavía no está claro si esta noche tocarán Lady Gaga y Elton John, aunque sí se han descargado dos pianos en el lugar del acto El dueño de Amazon y tercera persona más rica del mundo, Jeff Bezos, y la periodista Lauren Sánchez ya son marido y mujer, después de intercambiarse carísimos y fabulosos anillos la noche del viernes en una espectacular ceremonia en la isla de San Giorgio de Venecia. Los tres días de fiesta terminan hoy con un baile de máscaras del Settecento en el Arsenale, y también con una manifestación de protesta a las cinco de la tarde de quienes piensan que la boda es la horterada del siglo y no se puede permitir que Venecia se venda como decorado para fiestas de millonarios. La esposa se llama ahora Lauren Sanchez Bezos, según ha anunciado ella misma en Instagram, junto a las primeras fotos vestida de novia, un modelo de sirena de Dolce & Gabanna, resolución del acuciante enigma que estos días atormentaba a miles de seguidores en redes sociales. El novio, por su parte, recurrió a un esmoquin de Armani, con pajarita. Pero hay una interminable cantidad de relevantes banalidades más que se han filtrado y se pueden reseñar. Por ejemplo, que la noche antes de la boda durmieron en suites separadas en uno de los cinco hoteles de siete estrellas que han alquilado, el Aman, aunque eso supusiera el doble de gasto (son 11.000 la habitación), pero la tradición es la tradición. No se vieron durante el día y la esposa salió ya para San Giorgio a las cuatro de la tarde, sola, con un tailleur blanco Dior, un foulard de seda y sandalias de Jimmy Choo. Luego en la isla ya se cambió, se ha fabulado con 27 modelos distintos a su disposición. Más un anillazo con un diamante de 40 quilates, collar de brillantes y brazalete de perlas. Bezos llegó hacia las seis y media. En una flota reservada de 38 lanchas-taxi fueron llegando todos los invitados, medio Hollywood, Wall Street y parte de la Casa Blanca. Los paparazzi no daban abasto, apostados durante horas bajo un sol que carbonizaba las pestañas, siguiendo en lanchas a cada celebridad por los canales. Bezos tuvo el detalle de mandar unos helados a los que hacían guardia frente a su hotel. La elegante isla de San Giorgio, con su estilizado campanario y la cúpula de Palladio, se halla frente a la plaza de San Marco y estaba blindada con seguridad pública y privada. Además de exmarines y las legiones de guardaespaldas personales de cada famoso, fuerzas del orden italianas, pues se trataba en realidad de un acto de alto riesgo, por la presencia de dos hijos de Donald Trump (Ivanka y Donald junior), y jefes de Estado como la reina Rania de Jordania. Además, Bezos es uno de los más destacados magnates que apoya al presidente de Estados Unidos. Había agentes en motos de agua, submarinistas y dos perros especializados en olisquear explosivos. Según ha trascendido, responden a los nombres de Diesel (un pastor belga) y Aron (un labrador). Se desconoce si son nombres en clave o son los reales. El resto de los 250 invitados que andaban por allí son mucho más conocidos y no necesitan presentación. El clan Kardashian al completo, Leonardo di Caprio, Orlando Bloom, Oprah Winfrey, Sidney Sweeney, François-Henri Pinault… La mayoría pasó la mañana dando una vuelta y haciendo shopping, o de compras como se decía antes de que pareciera una actividad deportiva. El único bicho raro, que se sepa, a quien se le ocurrió visitar algo de interés artístico en Venecia fue a Bill Gates. Apasionado de Leonardo da Vinci, que quiso ver con sus propios ojos el celebérrimo dibujo (hablamos de otro concepto de fama) Hombre de Vitruvio, que se expone de forma excepcional en la Academia estos días. Normalmente está guardado en el depósito del museo. Por la tarde, cuando empezaba a aplacarse el calor tropical de Venecia, en plena ola de calor africano en Italia, ya estaban todos los invitados en San Giorgio. La prensa especializada ha concluido que el rosa era el color dominante entre las invitadas, con mayor o menor acierto, dadas las notas asignadas en la mordaz y sesuda crítica de modelos, con algún cinquillo. Todo este despliegue de lujo desbordante chocaba con las octavillas que volaban por Venecia, lanzadas por quienes se oponen al deslumbrante evento, con un mensaje que invitaba a la reflexión sobre cómo está el mundo: “Durante el tiempo que tardas en leer esto Bezos ha ganado más que tu salario de un mes”. En cuanto a las protestas contra “la privatización de la ciudad”, al final no ha habido sorpresas. Se habló de que los activistas iban a impedir el acceso a la boda con barcas y botes hinchables, y hasta lanzándose al agua en persona si era preciso, pero no pasó nada. El acto central será en la tarde de este sábado, una manifestación que partirá a las cinco de la estación ferroviaria y recorrerá el centro de la ciudad hasta Rialto con el lema “No Bezos No War” (No a Bezos, no a la guerra). Según sus promotores, protestan contra “un sistema capitalista subcontratado a la tecnología y exento de impuestos, proyectado para aumentar la desigualdad social y legitimar los nuevos autoritarismos, promovidos por el presidente de los Estados Unidos, Donald Trump”. Por su parte, la ministra de Turismo, Daniela Santanché, aseguró que el evento tendrá en Venecia un impacto positivo de 957 millones de euros. Los hoteles, no obstante, según ha lamentado el sector, han estado al 85% de ocupación, lo normal en estas fechas. La puesta de escena del enlace ―pues el matrimonio legal ya ha sido firmado en Estados Unidos, según diversos medios― tuvo lugar en el Teatro Verde, un hermoso anfiteatro de mármol blanco rodeado de pinos marítimos. Matteo Bocelli, hijo del famoso tenor Andrea, entonó una canción de Elvis Presley, Can't help falling in love (No puedo evitar enamorarme). Cena selecta de chefs italianos y franceses. El menú principal fue de Fabrizio Mellino, del restaurante Quattro passi de Nerano, un tres estrellas Michelin de la Costa Amalfitana. Plato estrella, spaghetti alla Nerano, con calabacín frito y queso provolone. De postre, encargó en la famosa pastelería Sal De Riso, de Minori, en la misma comarca, mil porciones mignon de delicias de limón con ricotta y pera. También había pizza con masa enviada por Ciro Oliva, del barrio Sanità de Nápoles. Como colofón, tarta-escultura nupcial del pastelero parisino Cédric Grolet. Pista de baile flotante sobre la laguna y bajo las estrellas. A todo esto, hay una abadía en la misma isla, donde retumbó el chunda-chunda del jolgorio hasta el amanecer. El abad de San Giorgio Maggiore, Stefano Visintin, se ha permitido criticar discretamente la “excesiva mundanidad” del evento y el uso de lugar “como postal para ricos”: “No está prohibido, aquí hay muchos eventos, pero hecho así, de esta manera, puede ser un poco impactante, porque es una frivolidad ostentada que chirría con la naturaleza de la isla, más cultural y espiritual”, ha declarado al Corriere della Sera. Pero ya queda menos. El fin de fiesta será esta noche del sábado, con un baile de máscaras estilo Settecento en el Arsenale, los viejos astilleros de la república veneciana. Todavía por la mañana no estaba del todo claro si, como se viene anunciando, tocarán Lady Gaga y Elton John, aunque sí se han descargado dos pianos en el lugar del acto. Pero es que hasta se comenta que se puede unir Beyoncé...."

mov_B2D41A70AE824D9624F5F54938DD87D3,2025-06-28 12:26:46,pt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]Está sendo o casamento mais público e mais secreto do ano. Na sexta-feira (27), o evento principal da extravagância veneziana de três dias de Jeff Bezos e Lauren Sanchez culminou em uma cerimônia privada realizada na isolada e histórica ilha de San Giorgio Maggiore, no sestiere de San Marco. Durante a tarde, os cerca de 200 convidados famosos, incluindo a família Kardashian-Jenner, Bill Gates, Karlie Kloss, Oprah Winfrey e Usher, foram fotografados embarcando em táxis aquáticos que os levariam às festividades, mas sua visibilidade terminou ali, com os convidados aparentemente aderindo a um blecaute nas redes sociais durante todos os eventos do fim de semana. A cerimônia terminou discretamente, exceto por um sinal do mundo da moda — uma capa digital da Vogue oferecendo um primeiro olhar sobre o vestido de Sanchez. Após muita especulação (e avistamentos não tão sutis do estilista Domenico Dolce em Veneza), revelou-se que seu vestido era um design personalizado da Dolce & Gabbana que levou um ano e meio para ser confeccionado. O vestido de renda com corpete e gola alta tinha 180 botões sacerdotais cobertos com chiffon de seda adornando a frente. Ao longo da noite, segundo a Vogue, ela fez mais duas trocas de roupa: um vestido com decote coração — outra referência, desta vez ao filme ""Gilda"" de 1946 — para o jantar de casamento, e um intrincado vestido de coquetel da Oscar de la Renta com 175.000 cristais. San Giorgio Maggiore é conhecida por suas reluzentes basílicas renascentistas de mármore, projetadas pelo arquiteto italiano Andrea Palladio. Mas pode ter havido outro motivo mais pragmático para o casal optar pela ilha: privacidade. Após protestos contínuos na cidade — incluindo ameaças de bloqueio de canais, faixas em estilo guerrilha e manequins inquietantes de Bezos — que supostamente forçaram Sanchez e Bezos a mudar um dos locais do fim de semana no último minuto, a segurança e inacessibilidade da ilha foram fatores decisivos em sua escolha. O Ministério do Turismo de Veneza estimou que as celebrações gerarão quase 68% do faturamento anual do turismo da cidade em apenas um fim de semana — mas manifestantes protestaram contra o que consideram ser uma tomada da idílica cidade-arquipélago italiana por algumas das pessoas mais ricas do mundo. Durante a cerimônia, o bilionário fundador da Amazon e a ex-jornalista provavelmente trocaram alianças apenas de maneira simbólica. Ainda não está claro quando o casal se casa legalmente (ou se já o fizeram, antes desta semana, nos EUA). Um porta-voz do gabinete do prefeito de Veneza havia informado à CNN na quinta-feira que a cidade não recebeu um pedido oficial do casal, significando que os eventos desta semana são cerimoniais e não terão validade legal. Pouco depois que as fotos da Vogue foram divulgadas, Sanchez mudou seu nome de usuário no Instagram para Lauren Sanchez Bezos. Uma festa repleta de estrelas Antes da celebração, a própria Sanchez dirigiu-se a San Giorgio Maggiore vestindo um conjunto branco alfaiatado inspirado nos anos 60 da Dior, com um lenço de seda estampado envolvendo sua cabeça ao estilo Hepburn, sapatos Jimmy Choo e uma bolsa Kelly da Hermès. Ela mandou beijos para os fotógrafos ao embarcar em um táxi aquático. Os convidados circularam durante todo o fim de semana usando uma variedade de marcas de luxo, incluindo Roberto Cavalli vintage, Dolce & Gabbana, Oscar de la Renta e Versace. A caminho de San Giorgio Maggiore, Kylie Jenner usava um vestido longo azul-claro com corpete de amarrar, Kim Kardashian escolheu um vestido justo cor de caramelo e Oprah optou por uma silhueta sereia drapeada em rosa. Embora os detalhes sobre os artistas do casamento, como muito mais, tenham sido mantidos em sigilo, a mídia italiana informou que Matteo Bocelli — filho de Andrea Bocelli, o reverenciado tenor italiano que se apresentou nos casamentos de Kim e Kourtney Kardashian em 2014 e 2022, respectivamente — iniciou a noite cantando ""Can't Help Falling in Love"" de Elvis Presley. E se Bocelli emocionou os convidados, Lady Gaga — que supostamente encerrará o último dia das festividades no sábado — certamente animará a festa. Espera-se que a megaestrela pop se apresente no antigo estaleiro medieval de Veneza, o Arsenale — que foi modernizado com espaços culturais e sedia a Bienal de Veneza anual."

Lo que debía ser una unión íntima se convirtió rápidamente en el evento social del año, reuniendo a estrellas, empresarios, políticos y figuras de élite mundial. Y como era de esperarse, el lujo y los detalles sorprendentes no faltaron. La historia de amor entre Jeff y Lauren comenzó en 2019 y, tras un compromiso privado en 2023 a bordo del megayate Koru, hoy por fin dieron el “sí, acepto”. Desde la discreta propuesta, escondida bajo una almohada en altamar, hasta una boda con locaciones secretas y piezas de alta joyería valuadas en millones, todo en esta unión grita exclusividad. La ceremonia se celebró en el icónico Teatro Verde, ubicado en la isla de San Giorgio Maggiore, un rincón histórico de Venecia. Lauren deslumbró con un vestido de encaje firmado por Dolce & Gabbana, con 180 botones forrados a mano en seda chiffon, una pieza que requirió más de 900 horas de trabajo artesanal. Y si eso no fuera suficiente, la novia lució un collar de diamantes valuado entre 3 y 5 millones de dólares, regalo de bodas de Bezos, acompañado por unos pendientes a juego. Pero eso no fue todo: durante los tres días de celebración, Lauren alternó atuendos de alta costura de Schiaparelli, Dior y Hermès, mientras que Jeff apostó por looks elegantes y minimalistas, dejando que el brillo lo llevara su futura esposa. Se rumora que sus estilistas firmaron acuerdos de confidencialidad para proteger la identidad de las casas de moda involucradas. Uno de los detalles más comentados fue la invitación de boda, decorada con mariposas, aves y estrellas fugaces en tonos blanco y dorado. Pero lo que más llamó la atención fue una petición inesperada: los novios pidieron no recibir regalos, y en su lugar, anunciaron que realizarían donaciones en nombre de sus invitados a tres organizaciones venecianas. Las beneficiadas fueron la oficina de la UNESCO en Venecia, CORILA (para la restauración de los hábitats de la laguna) y la Venice International University. La intención, señalaron, es “asegurar que esta ciudad siga inspirando maravilla por generaciones”. A la boda asistieron más de 250 invitados, entre ellos algunas de las figuras más influyentes del entretenimiento y la política. Desde Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Brady, Sydney Sweeney, Orlando Bloom, hasta la familia Kardashian-Jenner y Ivanka Trump, todos llegaron a bordo de yates, vaporettos o incluso helicópteros. La planificación del evento corrió a cargo de Lanza & Baucina, la misma firma detrás del enlace de George Clooney, expertos en bodas de ultra lujo. El fin de semana incluyó fiestas previas con temáticas excéntricas, como una foam party en el yate de 500 millones de dólares de Bezos, y cenas privadas en palacios venecianos, todo envuelto en el más absoluto hermetismo."

La pareja intercambió anillos en una espectacular ceremonia religiosa celebrada la noche del viernes 27 de junio en la exclusiva isla de San Giorgio, Venecia. Este evento es parte de la lujosa celebración de tres días en la ciudad italiana, que culmina hoy con un baile de máscaras del Settecento en el Arsenale. La boda, a la que asistieron cerca de 200 invitados, incluyendo celebridades como Leonardo DiCaprio y Orlando Bloom, se ha caracterizado por un estricto protocolo de seguridad y una supuesta donación de 1.2 millones de dólares por parte de Bezos a Venecia. La esposa del fundador de Amazon, ahora conocida como Lauren Sánchez Bezos, compartió en Instagram las primeras imágenes de su vestido de novia: un modelo de sirena de Dolce & Gabbana con 180 botones, que requirió 900 horas de costura inspirado en el atuendo de Sophia Loren en la película «Houseboat» de 1958. Jeff Bezos optó por un lujoso esmoquin de Armani, aunque aun no compartió imágenes en sus redes sociales. La lujosa boda de Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sánchez: curiosidades y protocolo de seguridad La boda de Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sánchez estuvo cargada de lujos y entre las curiosidades del evento trascendió que la noche previa a la boda, la pareja durmió en suites separadas en el lujoso Hotel Aman de Venecia, respetando la tradición, a pesar del elevado costo de las habitaciones. Lauren Sánchez se dirigió sola a la isla de San Giorgio a las cuatro de la tarde, vestida inicialmente con un traje blanco de Dior que luego se cambió en la isla. Se rumorea que tuvo hasta 27 modelos a su disposición, además de un impresionante anillo de diamante de 40 quilates. Jeff Bezos por su parte llegó alrededor de las seis y media de la tarde, y los 200 invitados, que incluyeron a personalidades de Hollywood, Wall Street y parte de la Casa Blanca, fueron transportados en una flota de 38 lanchas-taxi reservadas. Los paparazzi, que cubrieron incansablemente el evento, incluso recibieron helados de cortesía por parte de Bezos. En la velada del viernes la elegante isla de San Giorgio fue «blindada» con un extenso dispositivo de seguridad. La boda contó con seguridad privada, guardaespaldas personales e incluso las fuerzas del orden italianas implementaron un operativo de alto riesgo debido a la presencia de Ivanka y Donald Trump Jr. La boda de Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sánchez llega a su fin con un baile de máscaras Se rumorea que esta última jornada cuente con la actuación de Lady Gaga y Elton John. Aun con algunos enigmas, la lujosa boda no pasó desapercibida y hoy llegará a su fin. Sir Elton John, que se encontraba en Capri para otra boda de lujo, podría haberse unido a las festividades venecianas en su jet privado. Las celebraciones de la lujosa boda de Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sánchez en Venecia culminan la noche de este sábado con un baile de máscaras al estilo del Settecento en el Arsenale, una antigua base naval de la ciudad italiana."

Un mariage ultra VIP avec des stars à la pelle, et même quelques personnalités françaises qui se sont glissées dans la fête. On vous raconte tout ! Ce vendredi 27 juin 2025, Jeff Bezos et Lauren Sánchez ont officiellement scellé leur amour lors d'une somptueuse cérémonie organisée à Venise. Pour l'occasion, les jet-setteurs les plus en vue de la planète avaient fait le déplacement. Dans les canaux de la Sérénissime, on a pu apercevoir Oprah Winfrey, Karlie Kloss enceinte jusqu'aux yeux, Ivanka Trump accompagnée de Jared Kushner en total look glamour, ou encore la reine Rania de Jordanie, sublimée par une robe Armani Privé dégradée de bleu. Le clan Kardashian était aussi de la partie, avec Kris, Khloe, Kylie et Kendall, tout comme les ex-époux Bill et Melinda Gates. En bref, tout le gratin ! Et ce n'est pas tout car entre deux têtes hollywoodiennes, quelques têtes bien françaises ont aussi été repérées : Xavier Niel et Delphine Arnault ont fait une apparition remarquée, tout comme François-Henri Pinault, sans sa compagne Salma Hayek cette fois. Les trois as du business s'étaient rendus quelques heures plus tôt au show Dior avant de sauter dans un bateau pour rejoindre la cérémonie. Quels artistes se sont invités à la fête ? Côté ambiance, Jeff Bezos et Lauren Sánchez ont sorti l'arsenal. Si le ""oui"" officiel a été prononcé le 27 juin, les vraies festivités étaient programmées pour le samedi 28 juin dans le mythique quartier de l'Arsenale. Et pour assurer le show ? DJ Cassidy, le DJ préféré des stars, celui-là même qui a fait danser Barack Obama, Jay-Z, et Beyonce. Mais ce n'est pas tout : selon plusieurs sources, Lady Gaga et Sir Elton John étaient pressentis pour offrir des performances exclusives, rien que ça ! Le ténor Matteo Bocelli, fils d'Andrea Bocelli, était aussi annoncé pour pousser la chansonnette. Une programmation à la hauteur du portefeuille du marié. Comment l'histoire d'amour entre Jeff Bezos et Lauren Sánchez a-t-elle commencé ? Si aujourd'hui les amoureux vivent un conte de fées, leur début était bien plus compliqué. Jeff Bezos rencontre Lauren Sánchez en 2018, alors qu'il est encore marié à MacKenzie Scott. En janvier 2019, leur liaison est révélée, créant une onde de choc médiatique. Le milliardaire divorce dans la foulée et s'affiche dès lors au bras de la journaliste américaine, passionnée d'aviation. Depuis, les deux tourtereaux voyagent à travers le monde, main dans la main, souvent à bord du superyacht du boss d'Amazon. En 2023, les fiançailles sont officiellement annoncées. Deux ans plus tard, la bague au doigt est bien en place. Et toute la Jet Set était là pour applaudir."

mov_ADAC8E7468D82A4AC078E37D4FE9FFBF,2025-06-28 14:36:00,pt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]Foi o casamento mais público e mais secreto do ano. Na sexta-feira, o evento principal da extravagância veneziana de três dias de Jeff Bezos e Lauren Sánchez culminou numa cerimónia privada realizada na ilha histórica e isolada de San Giorgio Maggiore, no sestiere [bairro] de San Marco. À tarde, os cerca de 200 membros da lista de convidados famosos, incluindo a família Kardashian-Jenner, Bill Gates, Karlie Kloss, Oprah Winfrey e Usher, foram fotografados a entrar nos táxis aquáticos que os transportariam para as festividades, mas a sua visibilidade terminou aí, com os convidados a aderirem a um aparente blackout das redes sociais, uma vez dentro de cada um dos eventos do fim de semana. A cerimónia terminou de forma discreta, exceto por um sinal do mundo da moda - uma capa digital da Vogue que oferecia um primeiro olhar sobre o vestido de Sánchez. Depois de muita especulação (e de avistamentos não tão subtis do estilista Domenico Dolce em Veneza), foi revelado que o seu vestido era um design personalizado da Dolce & Gabbana e que tinha sido feito durante um ano e meio. O vestido com espartilho de renda de gola alta tinha 180 botões de padre cobertos de musselina de seda na frente. Ao longo da noite, de acordo com a Vogue, a noiva trocou de roupa mais duas vezes: um vestido de gola alta - outra referência, desta vez ao filme de 1946 “Gilda” - para o jantar de casamento, e um intrincado vestido de cocktail com 175.000 cristais de Oscar de la Renta. San Giorgio Maggiore é conhecida pelas suas basílicas renascentistas em mármore reluzente, desenhadas pelo arquiteto italiano Andrea Palladio. Mas pode ter havido outra razão, mais pragmática, para o casal ter optado pela ilha: a privacidade. Depois dos contínuos protestos na cidade - incluindo a ameaça de bloqueios de canais, faixas de guerrilha e estranhos manequins de Bezos - que alegadamente forçaram Sánchez e Bezos a mudar um dos locais do fim de semana à última hora, a segurança e a inacessibilidade da ilha terão sido um fator-chave na sua decisão. O Ministério do Turismo de Veneza estimou que as celebrações irão gerar quase 68% do volume de negócios anual do turismo da cidade num só fim de semana - mas os manifestantes têm protestado contra o que consideram ser uma tomada de controlo da idílica cidade do arquipélago italiano por algumas das pessoas mais ricas do mundo. Durante a cerimónia, o bilionário fundador da Amazon e a ex-jornalista terão trocado simbolicamente as alianças. Ainda não se sabe quando é que o casal se casa legalmente (ou se já o tinha feito, antes desta semana, nos EUA). Um porta-voz do gabinete do presidente da Câmara de Veneza disse à CNN na quinta-feira que a cidade não recebeu um pedido oficial do casal, o que significa que os eventos desta semana são cerimoniais e não serão juridicamente vinculativos. Pouco depois de as fotografias da Vogue terem sido publicadas, Sanchez mudou o nome da sua conta de Instagram para Lauren Sánchez Bezos. Festa repleta de estrelas Antes da celebração, a própria Sánchez dirigiu-se a San Giorgio Maggiore vestida com um fato de saia branca da Dior, inspirado nos anos 60, com um lenço de seda estampado enrolado ao estilo Hepburn à volta da cabeça, saltos Jimmy Choo e uma mala Hermès Kelly. A apresentadora mandou beijos aos fotógrafos ao entrar num táxi aquático. Os convidados misturaram-se durante todo o fim de semana vestindo uma variedade de designers de luxo, incluindo Roberto Cavalli vintage, Dolce & Gabbana, Oscar de la Renta e Versace. A caminho de San Giorgio Maggiore, Kylie Jenner usou um vestido longo azul com espartilho e renda, Kim Kardashian escolheu um vestido escuro cor de caramelo e Oprah optou por uma silhueta de sereia cor-de-rosa drapeada.   Embora os pormenores sobre os artistas do casamento, tal como muitas outras coisas, tenham sido mantidos em segredo, os meios de comunicação italianos noticiaram que Matteo Bocelli - filho de Andrea Bocelli, o venerado tenor italiano que atuou nos casamentos de Kim e Kourtney Kardashian em 2014 e 2022, respetivamente - começou a noite cantando “Can't Help Falling in Love” de Elvis Presley. E se Bocelli deixou os convidados com os olhos marejados, esta noite estarão sem dúvida prontos para a festa. O evento de encerramento terá lugar no antigo estaleiro medieval de Veneza, o Arsenale - que foi modernizado com espaços culturais e acolhe anualmente a Bienal de Veneza. *Sharon Braithwaite contribuiu para este artigo"
mov_C5F45A2A240E912F8FB6D02146134B0A,2025-06-28 15:01:01,en,WEB,"  A Lavish Venetian Party: Decoding the Bezos-Sánchez wedding The recent nuptials of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez have captivated global attention, evolving into a modern-day fairytale dissected across social media platforms. the event, steeped in extravagance and security, wasn't merely a wedding; it was a spectacle. At the heart of the captivation lies the bride's custom-made gown – a breathtaking creation boasting 180 meticulously crafted buttons, requiring over 900 hours of skilled artistry. The design pays homage to a memorable piece of cinematic history: the dress Sophia Loren wore in the 1958 film Houseboat, where her character found love with Cary Grant (known as Cintia in Spain). A Fortress of Romance: Security and Seclusion The wedding unfolded on the exclusive island of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, Italy, directly facing the iconic St. Mark's Square. the choice of location wasn't simply aesthetic; it necessitated a extensive security operation. With high-profile guests including children of former President Donald Trump – Ivanka and Donald Jr. – and Queen rania of Jordan, alongside Bezos's prominent support for the current US governance, the event was deemed a high-risk undertaking. Beyond the presence of Italian law enforcement,a private security detail comprised of ex-military personnel and individual bodyguards for each celebrity attendee was deployed. The perimeter was secured by watercraft,including specialized submarines,and canine units – Diesel,a Belgian Shepherd,and Aron,a Labrador – trained in explosive detection. This level of security reflects the current climate of heightened concern for high-profile individuals; according to a 2023 report by the Global Security Exchange, personal security spending among ultra-high-net-worth individuals increased by 15% year-over-year. The Guest List: A Convergence of Power and influence The guest list, numbering around 250, read like a who's who of global elites. Representatives from Hollywood,Wall Street,and Washington D.C. converged on Venice. The Kardashian family, Leonardo DiCaprio, Orlando Bloom, Oprah Winfrey, and Sydney Sweeney were among the attendees, many of whom spent the morning indulging in retail therapy – a pastime that, according to a recent study by Deloitte, now accounts for over 30% of leisure time for affluent individuals. Guests arrived via a fleet of 38 speedboats,a logistical feat designed to maintain privacy and control access. Bezos himself demonstrated a thoughtful gesture by providing ice cream to the paparazzi stationed for hours under the intense Italian sun, a small concession to the relentless media presence. Tradition and Modern Luxury: Details of the Celebration The couple adhered to certain traditions, despite the opulent setting. They spent the night before the ceremony in separate suites at the Aman Venice, a five-star hotel, even though combining accommodations would have been more cost-effective (rooms reportedly cost around $11,000 per night). This practise, rooted in superstition, mirrors the tradition of avoiding contact between the bride and groom on the eve of the wedding, believed to bring good luck. Sánchez made her initial appearance in a white Dior pantsuit, paired with a silk scarf and Jimmy Choo sandals, before changing into one of 27 different gowns available for the ceremony. Her jewelry included a 40-carat diamond ring, a brilliant necklace, and a pearl bracelet. bezos, in contrast, opted for a classic Armani tuxedo with a bow tie. The attention to detail extended to every aspect of the event, solidifying its status as a landmark celebration of wealth, power, and romance. The Widening Wealth Gap: A Glimpse into Extreme Disparity The sheer scale of wealth concentration in the hands of a few is a stark reality of the modern economic landscape. It's a phenomenon so pronounced that, even as you finish reading these words, individuals like Jeff bezos are likely accumulating earnings that dwarf the monthly income of the average worker. This isn't merely a matter of individual success; it's a symptom of a system increasingly characterized by extreme economic disparity. The Bezos Effect: A Symbol of Concentrated Wealth The opening statement – that bezos earns more during the time it takes to read this than many earn in a month – isn't hyperbole. As of late 2023, Bezos's net worth hovers around $160 billion. Even a conservative estimate of his daily earnings, factoring in investment returns and company valuations, easily surpasses the annual salary of a typical full-time employee. This dramatic contrast is further highlighted by recent reports from Oxfam, which indicate that the richest 1% now own nearly two-thirds of all new wealth created as 2020. This wealth isn't simply accumulated through innovation or hard work, although those factors certainly play a role. It's also fueled by systemic advantages, including favorable tax policies, stock market gains disproportionately benefiting the wealthy, and a decline in unionization which historically provided a counterbalance to corporate power. Beyond Bezos: The Broader trend of Inequality The concentration of wealth isn't limited to a single individual. The world's ten richest people control roughly the same amount of wealth as the bottom 50% of the global population, according to a 2023 report by the World Inequality Lab. this isn't a new trend, but it's accelerating. In 1980, the top 1% in the US held around 10% of the nation's wealth; today, that figure has surged to over 30%. This disparity manifests in numerous ways. Access to quality education, healthcare, and even basic necessities like affordable housing are increasingly determined by socioeconomic status. The ability to build generational wealth – a cornerstone of the American dream – is becoming increasingly out of reach for those not born into privilege. A Social scene Reflecting Economic Divides Recent events, like the high-profile gathering in Venice attended by celebrities like Kim and Khloe Kardashian, Kylie and Kendall Jenner, alongside Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez, serve as a visual depiction of this divide. These events aren't just about social connections; they're a demonstration of the lifestyles afforded by immense wealth, a world largely inaccessible to the vast majority. It's akin to observing the opulent court of Louis XIV while the peasantry struggled to survive – a visible chasm between the haves and have-nots. The Consequences of Extreme Inequality..."

Meanwhile, Khloe, also covering her eyes with a pair of shades, cut a trendy figure in an all-black ensemble along with a jacket. Their sisters Kendall, 29, and Kylie, 27, were nowhere in sight as the duo headed out of Venice, as they appeared to be staying in the city for longer. The celebrations are far from over, with the festivities slated to continue at the Arsenale di Venezia on Saturday night. Kris and Corey's departure comes after the mum-of-six wowed in a black dress with cream balloon tulle sleeves for the main event on Friday. Accessorising with dazzling silver earrings, the beauty looked incredible as she made her way to the wedding venue in a boat. Kim and Khloe made an early exit from the wedding afterparty on Friday night, with their supermodel sister Kendall, 29, following shortly after. They were spotted departing the star-studded rave by boat, captured in stylish photos set against the breath-taking backdrop of Italian architecture. Fans had been eagerly waiting to see what the Kardashian sisters would wear to the festivities, and they certainly pulled out all the stops on the night. Kylie displayed her enviable curves in a figure-hugging silver corset dress and a pair of stylish sunglasses. However, she came under fire from some fans who pointed out that her dress looked very close to white in certain lighting. Kylie risked Lauren's wrath with the bold choice since traditionally, white is the color reserved for the bride - and guests are usually urged to steer clear of any colour that may even appear close in order to avoid confusion or steal the spotlight. She was pictured boarding a boat taxi with her sister Kendall, who looked elegant in a black ensemble, on their way to the wedding. Meanwhile, Kim's outfit was however blasted as 'basic and boring' by fans, as the reality star slipped into a shiny black gown with laser-cut trimmings on its sides. The wedding, held two years after Jeff proposed to Lauren aboard his $500million superyacht, was described as 'extremely intimate' with a strict no-phone policy - with around 70 of the 200 guests being family members. The only images that emerged of the nuptials came via Lauren's official Instagram account - and photos of guests leaving the night-time celebrations were scarce. Jeff and Lauren are thought to have splashed out a staggering $20million on their multiple-day extravagant wedding bash. As guests arrived at the reception on Friday, they were welcomed by the stirring sounds of trumpets, violins, and a soulful Gospel choir. That same choir returned to belt out Whitney Houston's Higher Love right after the couple exchanged their vows, with guests cheering and singing along during the heartfelt moment. Opera singer Matteo Bocelli kicked off the wedding reception with a touching tribute, opening his set with the timeless Elvis Presley classic I Can't Help Falling in Love With You. The son of renowned tenor Andrea Bocelli stepped in since his father was tied up with concerts in southern Italy over the weekend. Earlier in the day, award-winning journalist Sanchez made a chic first appearance, stepping out of the five-star Aman Hotel in a sophisticated white Dior puff-sleeve suit, perfectly accessorized with a headscarf and oversized sunglasses. In the photographs, she flashed a dazzling new giant diamond ring that caught plenty of attention. It was revealed ahead of the nuptials that Jeff and Lauren had already legally tied the knot before today's official ceremony on San Giorgio Maggiore island. The star-studded celebrations kicked off Thursday evening with a lavish welcome dinner at the Campo Della Madonna dell'Orto. However, the billionaire couple and their A-list entourage had to seek shelter when a sudden thunderstorm rolled in during the pre-wedding party. Lauren wowed in a shimmering $100,000 gown by Daniel Roseberry, featuring intricate embroidery of swirling vines and florals in rich blue, green, and gold tones over a champagne-colored base. To mark the grand occasion, the couple reportedly rented out multiple locations around the city. An insider told DailyMail.com last week that San Giorgio Maggiore island is essentially 'off-limits to visitors' from June 24 through June 29. Originally, a massive party was scheduled for Saturday night at the Scuola Grande della Misericordia, but local media report it has since been relocated to another venue in the Arsenale district."

mov_ED175E5AF7C856CAF3647C402B5EBDD1,2025-06-28 16:25:44,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]El dueño de Amazon y tercera persona más rica del mundo, Jeff Bezos, y la periodista Lauren Sánchez ya son marido y mujer, después de intercambiarse carísimos y fabulosos anillos en la isla de San Giorgio de Venecia. Los tres días de fiesta terminan hoy con un baile de máscaras del Settecento en el Arsenale, y también con una manifestación de protesta a las cinco de la tarde de quienes piensan que la boda es la horterada del siglo y no se puede permitir que Venecia se venda como decorado para fiestas de millonarios. La esposa se llama ahora Lauren Sánchez Bezos, según ha anunciado ella misma en Instagram, junto a las primeras fotos vestida de novia, un modelo de sirena de Dolce & Gabanna, resolución del acuciante enigma que estos días atormentaba a miles de seguidores en redes sociales. Tiene hasta 180 botoncitos, ha llevado 900 horas de costura y está inspirado en el que llevaba Sophia Loren en 1958 en la película Houseboat, donde su personaje se casaba con Cary Grant (en España se llamó Cintia). El novio, por su parte, recurrió a un esmoquin de Armani, con pajarita. Pero hay una interminable cantidad de relevantes banalidades más que se han filtrado y se pueden reseñar. Por ejemplo, que la noche antes de la boda durmieron en suites separadas en uno de los cinco hoteles de siete estrellas que han alquilado, el Aman, aunque eso supusiera el doble de gasto (son 11.000 la habitación), pero la tradición es la tradición. No se vieron durante el día y la esposa salió ya para San Giorgio a las cuatro de la tarde, sola, con un tailleur blanco Dior, un foulard de seda y sandalias de Jimmy Choo. Luego en la isla ya se cambió, se ha fabulado con 27 modelos distintos a su disposición. Más un anillazo con un diamante de 40 quilates, collar de brillantes y brazalete de perlas. Bezos llegó hacia las seis y media. En una flota reservada de 38 lanchas-taxi fueron llegando todos los invitados, . Los paparazzi no daban abasto, apostados durante horas bajo un sol que carbonizaba las pestañas, siguiendo en lanchas a cada celebridad por los canales. Bezos tuvo el detalle de mandar unos helados a los que hacían guardia frente a su hotel. La elegante isla de San Giorgio, con su estilizado campanario y la cúpula de Palladio, se halla frente a la plaza de San Marco y estaba blindada con seguridad pública y privada. Además de exmarines y las legiones de guardaespaldas personales de cada famoso, fuerzas del orden italianas, pues se trataba en realidad de un acto de alto riesgo, por la presencia de dos hijos de Donald Trump (Ivanka y Donald junior), y jefes de Estado como la reina Rania de Jordania. Además, Bezos es uno de los más destacados magnates que apoya al presidente de Estados Unidos. Había agentes en motos de agua, submarinistas y dos perros especializados en olisquear explosivos. Según ha trascendido, responden a los nombres de Diesel (un pastor belga) y Aron (un labrador). Se desconoce si son nombres en clave o son los reales. El resto de son mucho más conocidos y no necesitan presentación. El clan Kardashian al completo, Leonardo di Caprio, Orlando Bloom, Oprah Winfrey, Sidney Sweeney, François-Henri Pinault… La mayoría pasó la mañana dando una vuelta y haciendo shopping, o de compras como se decía antes de que pareciera una actividad deportiva. El único bicho raro, que se sepa, a quien se le ocurrió visitar algo de interés artístico en Venecia fue a Bill Gates. Apasionado de Leonardo da Vinci, que quiso ver con sus propios ojos el celebérrimo dibujo (hablamos de otro concepto de fama) Hombre de Vitruvio, que se expone de forma excepcional en la Academia estos días. Normalmente está guardado en el depósito del museo. Por la tarde, cuando empezaba a aplacarse el calor tropical de Venecia, en plena ola de calor africano en Italia, ya estaban todos los invitados en San Giorgio. La prensa especializada ha concluido que el rosa era el color dominante entre las invitadas, con mayor o menor acierto, dadas las notas asignadas en la mordaz y sesuda crítica de modelos, con algún cinquillo. Todo este despliegue de lujo desbordante chocaba con las octavillas que volaban por Venecia, lanzadas por quienes se oponen al deslumbrante evento, con un mensaje que invitaba a la reflexión sobre cómo está el mundo: “Durante el tiempo que tardas en leer esto Bezos ha ganado más que tu salario de un mes”. En cuanto a , al final no ha habido sorpresas. Se habló de que los activistas iban a impedir el acceso a la boda con barcas y botes hinchables, y hasta lanzándose al agua en persona si era preciso, pero no pasó nada. El acto central será en la tarde de este sábado, una manifestación que partirá a las cinco de la estación ferroviaria y recorrerá el centro de la ciudad hasta Rialto con el lema “No Bezos No War” (No a Bezos, no a la guerra). Según sus promotores, protestan contra “un sistema capitalista subcontratado a la tecnología y exento de impuestos, proyectado para aumentar la desigualdad social y legitimar los nuevos autoritarismos, promovidos por el presidente de los Estados Unidos, Donald Trump”. Por su parte, la ministra de Turismo, Daniela Santanché, aseguró que el evento tendrá en Venecia un impacto positivo de 957 millones de euros. Los hoteles, no obstante, según ha lamentado el sector, han estado al 85% de ocupación, lo normal en estas fechas. La puesta de escena del enlace ―pues el matrimonio legal ya ha sido firmado en Estados Unidos, según diversos medios― tuvo lugar en el Teatro Verde, un hermoso anfiteatro de mármol blanco rodeado de pinos marítimos. Matteo Bocelli, hijo del famoso tenor Andrea, entonó una canción de Elvis Presley, Can't help falling in love (No puedo evitar enamorarme). Cena selecta de chefs italianos y franceses. El menú principal fue de Fabrizio Mellino, del restaurante Quattro passi de Nerano, un tres estrellas Michelin de la Costa Amalfitana. Plato estrella, spaghetti alla Nerano, con calabacín frito y queso provolone. De postre, encargó en la famosa pastelería Sal De Riso, de Minori, en la misma comarca, mil porciones mignon de delicias de limón con ricotta y pera. También había pizza con masa enviada por Ciro Oliva, del barrio Sanità de Nápoles. Como colofón, tarta-escultura nupcial del pastelero parisino Cédric Grolet. Pista de baile flotante sobre la laguna y bajo las estrellas. A todo esto, hay una abadía en la misma isla, donde retumbó el chunda-chunda del jolgorio hasta el amanecer. El abad de San Giorgio Maggiore, Stefano Visintin, se ha permitido criticar discretamente la “excesiva mundanidad” del evento y el uso de lugar “como postal para ricos”: “No está prohibido, aquí hay muchos eventos, pero hecho así, de esta manera, puede ser un poco impactante, porque es una frivolidad ostentada que chirría con la naturaleza de la isla, más cultural y espiritual”, ha declarado al Corriere della Sera. Pero ya queda menos. El fin de fiesta será esta noche del sábado, con un baile de máscaras estilo Settecento en el Arsenale, los viejos astilleros de la república veneciana. Todavía por la mañana no estaba del todo claro si, como se viene anunciando, tocarán Lady Gaga y Elton John, aunque sí se han descargado dos pianos en el lugar del acto. Hasta se comentaba que se puede unir Beyoncé, pero salvo que tenga el don de la ubicuidad se supone que este sábado tiene un concierto en Houston. Sir Elton John estaba este viernes en Italia, desde luego, pero en Capri, donde había sido contratado para otra boda de lujo, pero puede llegar en un momento a Venecia en su jet privado...."

8a5add83a88cdc2a432c40c7817c68ac,2025-06-28 18:25:00,ru,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[ru]Учёные научили бактерии превращать пластик в обезболивающее Немецкие биоинженеры модифицировали микробов для утилизации отходов и синтеза полезного препарата Команда микробиологов и биоинженеров из Германии представила уникальный способ повторного использования пластиковых отходов. Суть метода заключается в том, что гены бактерий Pseudomonas putida были перепрограммированы таким образом, чтобы не только разлагать определённые виды пластика, но и трансформировать продукты разложения в салицин — вещество, схожее по действию с аспирином. Салицин в природе содержится в коре ивы и применяется как противовоспалительное и анальгезирующее средство. Успешная синтетическая выработка этого вещества из отходов — серьёзный шаг в направлении устойчивой фармацевтики. Исследователи уверены, что данная технология сможет быть масштабирована в будущем. Исходный пластик, который используется в эксперименте — полиэтилентерефталат (ПЭТ), широко применяемый в бутылках и упаковках. Модифицированные бактерии расщепляют его на мономеры, которые затем метаболизируются в молекулы салцина. Ключевую роль здесь играют гены, заимствованные у растений и интегрированные в микробный геном. Профессор Йенс Кноблау, один из авторов исследования, отмечает, что технология уже демонстрирует высокую эффективность в лабораторных условиях: «Нам удалось не просто расщепить пластик, но и перенаправить метаболизм бактерии на синтез ценных веществ». Несмотря на успехи, метод требует доработки, прежде чем сможет использоваться на практике в промышленных масштабах. Необходимо достичь устойчивости процессов, увеличить выход вещества и обеспечить безопасность новых штаммов. Однако потенциал очевиден — и это шаг к новой экономике, где отходы становятся ресурсом. Изнанка: Технология объединяет две ключевые проблемы современности — загрязнение окружающей среды и рост потребности в лекарствах. Если бактерии смогут эффективно перерабатывать ПЭТ во вторичное сырьё и одновременно поставлять обезболивающие средства, это станет революцией как в экологической, так и в медицинской сферах. Особенно важно то, что речь идёт не о синтетике на нефтехимической основе, а о биотрансформации с минимальным экологическим следом.

bc7a4d8720e4cbb76def95b651297bec,2025-06-28 18:25:00,ru,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[ru]Дети по‑прежнему учат язык быстрее, чем искусственный интеллект Новые исследования объясняют, почему ребёнок обходит машины — и чего ждать от AI Учёные объясняют, что дети учат язык не пассивно, а через мультисенсорное взаимодействие, движение и эмоциональную вовлечённость. Они одновременно видят, слышат, трогают, наблюдают за мимикой и жестами родителей. И главное — получают немедленную обратную связь. Дети не просто запоминают слова, они буквально проживают язык: чувствуют интонацию, подражают звукам, играют с выражениями, исследуют мир через речь. Машины же пока работают с текстами и шаблонами без полноценного погружения в контекст. Примерный расчёт, который подчёркивает разрыв: чтобы человек учился языку на уровне GPT‑3, понадобилось бы 92 тысячи лет. Этот контраст показывает, что количество данных не равно качеству усвоения и глубине понимания. Учёные предлагают «конструктивистский» подход к изучению языка — через телесность, социальное взаимодействие и эмоциональный контекст. Эта модель помогает понять, почему ребёнок настолько опережает AI в освоении родного языка. В будущем такие принципы могут лечь в основу новых систем искусственного интеллекта. Возможно, машины начнут учиться языкам, опираясь не только на текст, но и на эмоции, телесные ощущения, связь с окружающим миром. Пока же дети остаются несравненными мастерами языкового освоения. Совет от Светланы: Говорите с детьми как можно больше, искренне и с радостью. Язык — это не набор слов, а живая ткань отношений и совместного опыта. Только так можно воспитать любовь к общению и миру. Фото: ИЗНАНКА Читайте, ставьте лайки, следите за обновлениями в наших социальных сетях и присылайте свои материалы в редакцию.

Austria (enviado especial).- Flavio Briatore había afirmado que el GP de Austria no iba a ser un “examen” para Franco Colapinto, aunque los influyentes periodistas británicos de Fórmula 1 insisten en que la quinta carrera  del argentino con Alpine, que se disputará este domingo, será crucial. Con examen o no, el fin de semana comenzó con tintes muy sombríos no solo para él, sino también para el equipo en general. Hubo momentos de dudas y desconcierto el viernes. Colapinto había acabado el primer día de entrenamientos para el Gran Premio de Austria en la última posición, a poco más de medio segundo de su compañero, Pierre Gasly. El final del sábado, cuando terminó la tanda clasificatoria, de pronto mostraba al argentino en una posición expectante: largará desde la posición 14, con el mérito incuestionable de haber traspasado la barrera de la Q1. Aunque tuvo que sortear todo tipo di dificultades para conseguirlo, algo que no puede desviarse del análisis global: que nadie espere un domingo de rosas en el velocísimo Red Bull Ring austríaco. Es que en el arranque del día, en la tercera sesión de entrenamientos, la tendencia del viernes negro continuaba. Hubo otro aparente golpe de efecto: Colapinto se situaba 19º, a 1,22s del más rápido, Lando Norris (McLaren). Resultaba poco consuelo situarse a tan solo 1,8 décima de Gasly, que era 17º. Los resultados hasta ese momento mostraban a los dos A525 tan hundidos como en las pruebas de clasificación del pasado GP de Mónaco. Solo quedaba una incógnita: los dos coches, inmanejables con media carga de nafta y neumáticos medios (banda amarilla) con los que se hizo una simulación de carrera, ¿iban a reaccionar al ponerse los blandos (banda roja) en las sesiones de clasificación para determinar la grilla de largada? Demasiadas veces este año, por puestas a punto equivocadas o por características inherentes al chasis, la velocidad a una vuelta era muy irregular. De repente el Alpine podía situarse entre los mejores ocho o quedar por detrás de la decimosegunda posición. La mirada de Colapinto, en el momento de la llegada al autódromo, cuando todo el trabajo estaba por hacerse - Créditos: @Agencia AFP Sin embargo, el sábado por la tarde llegó la hora de la verdad: los neumáticos blandos corrigieron, parcialmente, las deficiencias del chasis de los A525 y hubo mejoras. Llegado el momento, Franco se la jugaba. Dando rápidos y cortos movimientos contra-volante para domar un eje trasero muy rebelde, casi de rally, Colapinto lograba pasar de la Q1 a la Q2 en la posición de corte, la 15ª, con un tiempo de 1m05s288/1000, a solo 0,227s de Gasly, que pasaba a la Q3 en la 10ª posición, que iba a ser la suya definitiva. Colapinto, que había corrido de atrás durante toda la sesión, logró hacer su vuelta buena justo cuando terminaba la Q1, como un boxeador que está contra las cuerdas y mete una mano salvadora justo cuando suena la campana. Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Y en su buen hacer sabatino, el argentino, que el viernes había quedado a 1,596s del más rápido ese día, Norris (McLaren), se iba más temprano al área de prensa, pero a 1,057s del inglés. Una mejora nada espectacular, pero una mejora al fin, considerando la oscuridad de la que lograba emerger. “Fue un día complicado. Salí último, me pasaron todos y me afectó mucho el 'rebufo' (la turbulencia de los coches que iban por delante). El viento en las curvas rápidas me complicó mucho. No tengo mucha confianza acá en Austria en las curvas rápidas. Cuando creí haber dado un pasito (adelante) en esas curvas rápidas, me costó mucho (en la Q2). En la FP3 dimos muchas vueltas preparando la carrera de mañana”, detallaba el argentino, con un gesto que por momentos traslucía mayor confianza que la que había mostrado el día anterior. Pero no por eso conformidad. El circuito de Spielberg, colmado para ver el Gran Premio de Austria - Créditos: @Agencia AFP Podría aprobarse o no la configuración elegida por los técnicos de Alpine para comenzar el fin de semana: como el motor Renault es el menos potente de todos los usados en F1, ambos pilotos iban a salir a la FP1 con poca carga alar trasera para tener más velocidad en recta. Esto iba a ser un problema y se iba a acentuar el sábado porque hizo más calor, 28°C (47°C en pista para la clasificación) y la menor densidad del aire daba más velocidad en la recta pero menos apoyo en las curvas. Franco no había pretendido forzar al auto el viernes, pero apretó con todo en la FP3 del sábado. Alpine mandó a él y a Gasly a girar hasta 17 vueltas con los neumáticos medios para preparar la carrera. Y cargados de nafta, se veía claramente en la cámara embarcada la tendencia del eje trasero a entrar en trompo al acelerar y el comienzo de un “latigazo” peligroso que ambos pilotos debían corregir con repetidos y rápidos golpes de contra-volante. Cuando faltaban pocos minutos para el final de la tanda en la que ambos McLaren se “paseaban” en los dos primeros puestos, el argentino puso calzado blando (banda roja) y clavó el reloj en 1m05s546/1000. Casi en el mismo momento, Gasly cronometraba 1m05s366/1000, aunque se quejaba de que un Red Bull lo había obstaculizado. Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Publicidad Y la 14ª posición de Gasly del viernes, con problemas parecidos a los de Franco, se transformaba en una 17ª posición en ese ejercicio previo a la qualy. A solo 0,180s de su compañero francés, en la 19ª posición, por detrás del Haas de Esteban Ocon, quedaba el argentino. Cuando realmente importaba cumplía bien, aunque a último momento hacía un trompo sin consecuencias. Más en Deportes En la Q1 los Alpine recuperaron energía: Franco iba a superar a tipos experimentados como Lance Stroll, Esteban Ocon, Yuki Tsunoda, Carlos Sainz y Nico Hulkenberg. Ya en la Q2, la adherencia de la pista comenzaba a disminuir y a levantarse viento...."

Это втрое больше, чем исчезло за последние пять веков. Учёные отмечают, что даже если все угрозы будут устранены, около 250 видов всё равно окажутся на грани исчезновения. Особенно уязвимы крупные хищные и морские птицы: буревестники, бакланы, фрегаты. Кэрри Стюарт, автор исследования, подчёркивает: «Мы сталкиваемся с кризисом исчезновения птиц, не имеющим аналогов в современной истории». Несмотря на мрачные прогнозы, есть истории успеха: возвращение калифорнийского кондора и болотного лётчика в Британии подтверждает, что активная защита может работать. Скрытая сторона: Когда птицы исчезают, замолкает не только лес, но и невидимая связь между мирами. Это не просто утрата пения — это потеря хрупкого баланса, который удерживает нас на земле.

Para la ceremonia de bodas, Lauren Sánchez escogió como compañía a su familia más cercana. Su hija Ella, de 17 años, fue designada como dama de honor. La joven acompañó a su madre en el altar y leyó un pasaje durante la ceremonia, según confirmó la revista Vogue. “Ella es original; sigue su propio ritmo. Nunca había asistido a una prueba de vestuario y le encantó. Va a lucir increíble. Ha sido muy divertido vestir a todos los niños”, comentó Lauren Sánchez a Vogue en una entrevista previa al evento. Para la ocasión, Ella lució un traje de Dolce & Gabbana, la misma casa de moda encargada de diseñar el vestido de novia de su madre. Asímismo, la periodista y expresentadora de televisión caminó hacia el altar flanqueada por sus dos hijos: Nikko, de 24 años, y Evan, de 19. Nikko es hijo de Lauren con el exjugador de la NFL Tony González, mientras que Evan es fruto de su anterior matrimonio con el empresario Patrick Whitesell.

Un vestido de alta costura con historia El vestido de novia fue, como era de esperarse, uno de los grandes protagonistas de la jornada. Después de meses de especulación y algunas pistas no tan sutiles, Vogue reveló en su portada digital que Lauren Sánchez lució un vestido de encaje con corsé de cuello alto, confeccionado por Dolce & Gabbana. La prenda fue diseñada exclusivamente para ella y tardó un año y medio en realizarse. Una de las características principales del vestido fue la inclusión de 180 botones cubiertos de seda de chiffon que adornaban su parte frontal. La novia completó su look con unos pendientes de Dolce & Gabbana, un toque de brillo sutil para accesorizar el atuendo. Según reportó CNN, Sánchez hizo su llegada a la isla para la ceremonia vestida previamente con un conjunto blanco de falda y saco estilo años 60 de Dior, combinado con una pañoleta de seda estampada al estilo Audrey Hepburn, tacones de Jimmy Choo y un bolso Hermès Kelly.} El lugar elegido para el enlace fue la exclusiva isla de San Giorgio Maggiore, famosa por su arquitectura renacentista y sus basílicas de mármol diseñadas por Andrea Palladio. Además de su belleza, la ubicación ofrecía la privacidad que los novios buscaban, especialmente luego de reportes sobre protestas en Venecia que se oponían al ostentoso festejo. Más de 200 invitados fueron trasladados en taxi acuático hacia la isla para presenciar el evento. La lista fue un desfile de celebridades como Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Orlando Bloom, Kim Kardashian, Khloé Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Karlie Kloss, Leonardo DiCaprio, Usher y Tom Brady. También estuvieron presentes figuras como la reina Rania de Jordania, Bill Gates y su pareja Paula Hurd, el empresario François-Henri Pinault, y los diseñadores Domenico Dolce, Tommy Hilfiger y Diane von Fürstenberg. Para garantizar la privacidad, los asistentes siguieron un estricto protocolo de confidencialidad. No se compartieron imágenes desde el interior de la ceremonia, y las redes sociales permanecieron en silencio durante todo el evento. La única imagen pública llegó después, cuando Sánchez difundió en Instagram una foto de ella y Bezos después del intercambio de votos frente a sus invitados. La ex presentadora además modificó su nombre de usuario en dicha red social a Lauren Sánchez Bezos. El evento principal tuvo lugar el viernes 27 de junio, pero los festejos culminan este sábado con una fiesta nupcial donde se rumorea la presencia de Lady Gaga y Elton John."

mov_413A5C0C3EDF3FAE8F8D9218C5E74C90,2025-06-28 22:00:46,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]Cosa ci sarà di così imperscrutabile in quella manciata di metri quadri dove la luce è poca, la privacy ancor meno, e tutto è piccolo? Sta di fatto che al fascino della leggenda non potevano certo rinunciare Jeff Besoz e Lauren Sanchez. Ed ecco che d'improvviso calle Vallaresso si popola di bodyguard dal piglio ben poco amichevole. Porte e finestre sprangate, un laconico biglietto («chiuso per evento privato»). Fare due più due non era poi così difficile. Per chi sarà interamente riservato l'Harry's Bar? A premiare l'attesa di una manciata di fotografi, molti curiosi e alcuni paparazzi ben orientati ecco, ieri alle 13,30, la coppia dell'estate. INNAMORATI I signori Bezos non sono certo dei turisti qualunque: sembrano però degli innamorati veri, felici nella prima sortita pubblica da marito e moglie. T-shirt e pantalone in tinta grigioverde per Mr. Amazon, lei invece con miniabito nero a spalle scoperte, cappello di paglia, sandali vertiginosi e clutch Christian Dior. Sorridono increduli per la gioia che stanno vivendo. Alzano la mano, salutano (in italiano), non rispondono alle domande sulle proteste e scivolano all'interno dalla porta secondaria. Sono i primi ad arrivare (in taxi passando per l'hotel Monaco). Di lì a poco si vedono le sorelle Jenner (dopo un po' di shopping e qualche spritz), Tom Brady, Sydney Sweeney (a proposito: sguardi furtivi tra i due per tutta la serata precedente) e Orlando Bloom. E poi quasi tutti gli altri tranne Leonardo Di Caprio. Una cinquantina di vip e parenti. A fare gli onori di casa l'immarcescibile Arrigo, che nei giorni precedenti aveva preso chiaramente posizione sul matrimonio del multimilionario hi-tech: «Le nozze di Bezoz - ha ripetuto - sono un grande omaggio che lui ha fatto all'Italia e a Venezia. Bisogna solo dire grazie». IL GRAN FINALE Il gran finale ieri sera all'Arsenale è stato un omaggio ai fasti della Serenissima e alla tradizione del Carnevale: dopo la cena a base di specialità venete, una festa da ballo in maschera nello stile veneziano del Settecento, che ha consegnato alla notte (e al divieto di cellulari) il giallo sull'esibizione di Lady Gaga ed Elton John. Insomma, molto più dei cinque minuti di fuochi d'artificio visti l'altra sera nel cielo sopra Venezia, peraltro «non legati alle nozze» officiate sull'isola di San Giorgio, ha precisato la Questura dopo la diffusione di un video. Non foss'altro che per il sontuoso gruppo di 30 ballerine e performer fornito da NuArt Events, arrivato alle Tese dal quartier generale di Castelnuovo del Garda con tutta l'opulenza di costumi, parrucche, movenze e acrobazie, nella serata in cui sono stati serviti baccalà alla vicentina e monoporzioni di tiramisù. Un'atmosfera di sospensione della realtà, soprattutto rispetto alla manifestazione del pomeriggio, col corteo di 700 attivisti «No Bezos» dalla stazione di Santa Lucia al ponte di Rialto fra striscioni e fumogeni. Ripartiti i reali di Giordania, sono rimasti i regali per gli sposi e le bomboniere per gli invitati. «Una coppia di forcole, come per una gondola nuziale», ha spiegato Diane von Fürstenberg, descrivendo la creazione del maestro remer Saverio Pastor, scolpita a mano, con i nomi della coppia incisi in foglia d'oro. Gli ospiti hanno invece ricevuto in ricordo delle speciali calzature. Per gli uomini, friulane in velluto blu di Vibi Venezia delle sorelle Arrivabene. Per le donne, morbide ciabatte nere di Amazon, aperte sulla punta. © RIPRODUZIONE RISERVATA"

mov_4CA22657CEA06367AB8C768DC0F0730D,2025-06-29 04:04:22,en,WEB,"  It's been both the most public and secretive wedding of the year. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez concluded their three-day-long Venetian extravaganza on Saturday evening with a celebration at the Arsenale, a former medieval shipyard. The pair was seen traveling via boat to the venue, which hosts the annual Venice Biennale, with reporters and paparazzi in tow. CNN's Melissa Bell reported from a boat speeding alongside the couple's, as they waved on. Sanchez was seen in a pink gown, later revealed by Vogue magazine to be designed by Atelier Versace, while Bezos was in a suit and matching black shirt. Earlier in the day, the bride and groom were spotted heading into Harry's Bar, a fabled institution that once counted Ernest Hemingway among its customers. Meanwhile protestors gathered at the city's train station for a march. A secretive ceremony On Friday, the Amazon billionaire and former journalist wed in a private ceremony held on the secluded, historic San Giorgio Maggiore island in the San Marco sestiere. The celebrity guest list included the Kardashian-Jenner family, Bill Gates, Karlie Kloss, Oprah Winfrey and Usher. The approximately 200 guests have seemingly honored a social media blackout once inside each of the weekend's events. The ceremony ended discreetly, except for a signal from the fashion world — a Vogue digital cover offering a first look at Sanchez's gown. After much speculation (and not-so-subtle sightings of designer Domenico Dolce in Venice), it revealed her dress was a custom design by Dolce & Gabbana and was a year and a half in the making. The high-necked lace corseted gown had 180 silk chiffon-covered priest buttons dotting the front. Over the course of the night, per Vogue, she had two more outfit changes: a sweetheart-neck dress — another reference, this time to the 1946 film “Gilda” — for the wedding dinner, and an intricate cocktail dress featuring 175,000 crystals by Oscar de la Renta. unknown content item San Giorgio Maggiore is known for its gleaming marble Renaissance-era basilicas, designed by the Italian architect Andrea Palladio. But there may have been another, more pragmatic reason the couple opted for the island: privacy. After ongoing protests in the city — including the threat of canal blockades, guerilla-style banners and uncanny Bezos mannequins — allegedly forced Sanchez and Bezos to , the security and inaccessibility of the island was reportedly a key factor in their decision. Venice's Ministry of Tourism has estimated the celebrations will generate almost 68% of the city's annual tourism turnover in just one weekend — but demonstrators have rallied against what they perceive to be a takeover of the idyllic Italian archipelago city by some of the world's wealthiest people. During the ceremony, the pair likely exchanged rings symbolically. It remains unclear when the couple legally wed (or if they already have, prior to this week, in the US). A spokesperson for the mayor's office in Venice had told CNN on Thursday that the city did not receive an official request from the couple, meaning the events this week are ceremonial and will not be legally binding. Shortly after the Vogue photos were released, Sanchez changed her Instagram account handle to Lauren Sanchez Bezos. Star-studded bash Before Friday's celebration, Sanchez herself made her way to San Giorgio Maggiore dressed in a '60s-inspired tailored white skirt suit from Dior with a printed silk scarf wrapped Hepburn-style around her head, Jimmy Choo heels and an Hermès Kelly handbag. She blew kisses to photographers as she stepped into a water taxi. Guests have mingled all weekend wearing an array of luxury designers, including vintage Roberto Cavalli, Dolce & Gabbana, Oscar de la Renta and Versace. On the way to the island, Kylie Jenner wore a powder blue long lace-up corset gown, Kim Kardashian chose a slick dark toffee-colored dress and Oprah opted for a draped pink mermaid silhouette. Though details of the wedding performers, like much else, were largely kept under wraps, Italian media reported that Matteo Bocelli — son of Andrea Bocelli, the revered Italian tenor who performed at both Kim and Kourtney Kardashian's weddings in 2014 and 2022, respectively — began Friday evening singing “Can't Help Falling in Love” by Elvis Presley. This story has been updated with new details."

Die Gästeliste liest sich wie das Who's who der Weltelite: Bill Gates war da, ebenso wie Oprah Winfrey, Kim Kardashian, Leonardo DiCaprio, Tom Brady, Usher, Orlando Bloom und Ivanka Trump samt Ehemann Jared Kushner. Rund 200 geladene Gäste wurden in Venedig per Privatjet, Helikopter oder Megayacht eingeflogen, bevor sie in klassischen Wassertaxis weiter zur Zeremonie chauffiert wurden. Allein das geschätzte Gesamtvermögen der anwesenden Gäste? Über 435 Milliarden Dollar. Bezos selbst bringt laut Bloomberg gut 244 Milliarden Dollar mit, gefolgt von Bill Gates mit 178 Milliarden. Elon Musk und Mark Zuckerberg blieben der Hochzeit allerdings fern. Der Veranstaltungsort, die prestigeträchtige Cini-Stiftung auf der Insel San Giorgio Maggiore, war Schauplatz für ein Wochenende voller Opulenz: Dior, Balenciaga, Versace und Schiaparelli glitzerten auf Booten und Balkonen. Sanchez trug unter anderem eine Couture-Robe von Dior und eine maßgeschneiderte Korsage von Schiaparelli. Selbst der Protest ließ nicht auf sich warten: Greenpeace projizierte in Venedig ein riesiges Banner mit der Aufschrift: „If you can rent Venice for your wedding, you can pay more tax“ – ein klarer Seitenhieb auf die enorme Inszenierung. Übrigens: Die Junggesellinnenparty von Lauren Sanchez hatte bereits im Mai in Paris stattgefunden – mit dabei waren Kim Kardashian, Katy Perry und Eva Longoria. Ganz in Bezos' Stil war es nicht einfach eine Party – sondern eine private Kreuzfahrt auf der Seine. Fazit: Eine Hochzeit wie aus einem Billionärsmärchen – oder ein Realitätsverlust auf dem Wasser? In jedem Fall ein spektakulärer Höhepunkt der Jetset-Gesellschaft, inszeniert mit maximaler Diskretion und öffentlichem Interesse."

For her appearance at the wedding, Natasha reached into the deepest corners of fashion history and emerged golden. Her choice for the ceremony: a vintage gold Dior dress from the 1960s, all shimmer and sophistication. The gleaming skirt caught the light just right, while flirty tie-up shoulder straps added a youthful lift. She styled it with a vintage Hermès Kelly and a headpiece featuring what appeared to be a Blackamoor figurine. Blackamoor figures originate in European decorative art and typically depict African subjects in ornate dress. While some regard them as symbols of status or craftsmanship, they remain deeply controversial due to their colonial undertones and racialised imagery. Though still crafted in Venice as part of a long-standing tradition, where they're known as Moretto Veneziano, their appearance in modern fashion continues to raise eyebrows and spark debate. Earlier at the Met Gala, Natasha made headlines (again) in a Manish Malhotra moment – embroidered, exaggerated, and entirely unforgettable.

Jeff Bezos, unul dintre cei mai bogaţi oameni de pe planetă, şi iubita sa, jurnalista Lauren Sanchez, s-au căsătorit pe insula San Giorgio Maggiore. A fost o ceremonie discretă, la care au participat staruri precum Leonardo DiCaprio, Oprah Winfrey sau Ivanka Trump. Meniul a fost pregătit de un bucătar cu trei stele Michelin iar coloana sonoră a fost asigurată de Matteo Bocelli, fiul celebrului tenor italian, scrie observatornews.ro. Miliardarul Jeff Bezos a plecat cu o şalupă de la hotelul Aman spre cel mai important eveniment din viaţa sa. Îmbrăcat într-un frac negru, croit la comandă de casa de modă Dolce and Gabbana, mirele şi-a aşteptat aleasa pe insula San Giorgio Maggiore. Ea a venit spre sfârşitul după-amiezii, într-un costum alb realizat de Dior, asortat cu o pereche de ochelari de soare Tom Ford. La mână, avea inelul de logodnă cu diamant tăiat care valorează 4 milioane de dolari. Şeful Amazon a fost cel care i-a primit pe cei 200 de invitaţi - influenceri, actori, antreprenori, dar Lauren Sanchez a fost în centrul atenţiei. În faţa altarului, jurnalista a radiat de fericire în timp ce purta o rochie de mireasă parcă desprinsă din basme, realizată de casa de modă Dolce and Gabbana. Este o rochie de tip sirenă, cu mâneci din dantelă, cu trenă foarte lungă, decorată cu 180 de nasturi acoperiţi cu şifon de mătase, inspirată din moda italiană a anilor '60. Designerii au lucrat peste 900 de ore la ea. Atmosfera de bal a fost întreţinută de Matteo Bocelli.

Ceremonie fastuoasă în Veneția, cu invitați celebri și meniuri de lux Dacă la prima petrecere invitaţii s-au delectat cu pizza, aseară au avut parte de un meniu special. Tortul de nuntă a fost făcut de celebrul cofetar Cédric Grolet, iar felul principalul a fost pregătit de bucătarul cu 3 stele Michelin Fabrizio Mellino - spaghette alla Nerano, o reţetă clasică, din flori de dovlecel. ""Folosim floarea de dovlecel pentru a valorifica la maximum ingredientele, deoarece oferă o notă cromatică preparatului, scoţându-i astfel în evidenţă eleganţa"", a explicat Fabrizio Mellino, bucătar-şef. Momentul culminant al nunţii ca-n poveşti va fi sâmbătă seara, la Arsenalul din Veneţia, un fost şantier naval medieval, unde va fi organizată o petrecere unde ar urma să cânte Lady Gaga şi Elton John.  Mirii ar fi încheiat deja un contract prenupțial, menit să protejeze averea estimată la peste 230 de miliarde de dolari a lui Bezos."

Proaspat căsătoriţi, Jeff Bezos şi Lauren au fost surprinşi la ieşirea din hotelul Aman. Cei doi au fost preluaţi de o şalupă spre Arsenalul din Veneţia.  ""Cele trei zile de sărbătoare se apropie de sfârşit. Tinerii căsătoriţi tocmai au intrat în fostul şantier naval medieval Arsenale, o locaţie bine ferită de protestatari, unde invitaţii vor lua cina"", a relatat Paolo Santalucia, Associated Press. Concert Usher la nunta lui Jeff Bezos cu Lauren Sanchez Vezi și Atmosfera de la petrecere, scrie presa italiană, a fost întreţinută cu un concert susţinut de cântăreţul Usher, bun prieten cu Bezos. Înainte, miliardarul şi jurnalista i-au salutat pe admiratori şi s-au sărutat în faţa camerelor de filmat. La toate petrecerile, invitaţilor le-a fost interzis să folosească telefoanele mobile.  Pe acelaşi subiect Între timp, pe străzile din Veneţia, mai bine de 600 de persoane, localnici şi activişti, au protestat. Mulţi văd în petrecerile fastuoase exemplul clar al diferenţei tot mai mari dintre persoanele ultra-bogate şi oamenii de rând. ""Vreau să îmi apăr oraşul de acest turism de masă care continuă să îl copleşească în fiecare zi, iar Bezos este simbolul acestui turism"", strigă un veneţian.  ""Ne dorim un oraş liber, dedicat cetăţenilor. Suma oferită autorităţilor locale ni se pare ridicolă: un milion de euro, doar ca Bezos să-şi spele conştiinţa în faţa unor instituţii care, în ultimii ani, nu au făcut nimic pentru locuitorii Veneţiei"", zice un alt protestatar. La ceremonia religioasă, miliardarul Jeff Bezos a fost îmbrăcat într-un frac negru, croit la comandă de casa de modă Dolce and Gabbana, iar mirele şi-a aşteptat aleasa pe insula San Giorgio Maggiore. Ea a venit spre sfârşitul după-amiezii, într-un costum alb realizat de Dior, asortat cu o pereche de ochelari de soare Tom Ford.  La mână, avea inelul de logodnă cu diamant tăiat care valorează 4 milioane de dolari.  Şeful Amazon a fost cel care i-a primit pe cei 200 de invitaţi - influenceri, actori, antreprenori - dar Lauren Sanchez a fost în centrul atenţiei. În faţa altarului, jurnalista a radiat de fericire în timp ce purta o rochie de mireasă parcă desprinsă din basme, realizată de casa de modă Dolce and Gabbana. Este o rochie de tip sirenă, cu mâneci din dantelă, cu tren foarte lung, decorată cu 180 de nasturi acoperiţi cu şifon de mătase, inspirată din moda italiană a anilor 60. Designerii au lucrat peste 900 de ore la ea.  Atmosfera de bal a fost întreţinută de Matteo Bocelli. Tortul de nuntă a fost făcut de celebrul cofetar Cédric Grolet, iar felul principalul a fost pregătit de bucătarul cu 3 stele Michelin Fabrizio Mellino - spaghette alla Nerano, o reţetă clasică, din flori de dovlecel.  ""Folosim floarea de dovlecel pentru a valorifica la maximum ingredientele, deoarece oferă o notă cromatică preparatului, scoţându-i astfel în evidenţă eleganţa"", arată Fabrizio Mellino, bucătar-şef. Mirii ar fi încheiat deja un contract prenupțial, menit să protejeze averea estimată la peste 230 de miliarde de dolari a lui Bezos.

Los invitados de Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sánchez se despiden de la ciudad italiana la mañana después de la última fiesta de la extravagancia nupcial de 72 horas​ Kris, de 69 años, y Oprah, de 71, caminaron del brazo por el muelle, junto a Gayle King y el novio de Kris, Corey Gamble Bill Gates Mientras Oprah se veía elegante en blanco, mientras envolvía un brazo alrededor de los hombros de Kris y escuchaba atentamente a su amigo. BFF Gayle, quien memorablemente realizó el vuelo espacial Blue Origin de Bezos junto a Sánchez, llamó la atención con un vestido a rayas multicolor que mostraba su delgado marco. Bill Gates también fue visto saliendo de la ciudad italiana, todavía luciendo alegre después de las extravagantes nupcias de 72 horas. El fundador y multimillonario de Microsoft se mantuvo cómodo con un simple cuello y pantalones de polo negro con una gorra de béisbol a juego. La hija de Donald Trump Ivanka y su marido Jared Kushner también fueron vistos haciendo su salida, después de llegar a la ciudad italiana el martes. La pareja voló con sus tres hijos, Arabella Rose, de 13 años, Joseph Frederick, de 10, y Theodore James, de ocho, mientras que su cuñada Karlie Kloss, que está casada con el hermano de Jared, Joshua, también fue invitada. Entre los invitados repletos de estrellas a las nupcias se encontraban las hijas de Kris, Kim Kardashian, Khloe Kardashian, Kendall Jenner y Kylie Jenner, así como las estrellas de Hollywood Leonardo DiCaprio y Orlando Bloom y la estrella de la NFL Tom Brady . Pero Kim, de 44 años, y Khloe, de 41, abandonaron las festividades temprano, haciendo una rápida salida en barco el sábado, a pesar de que las festividades de 20 millones de dólares estaban lejos de terminar. Las hermanas fueron vistas vistiendo conjuntos casuales mientras salían discretamente de la ciudad italiana, presumiblemente para abordar un vuelo privado de regreso a Los Angeles . Bezos, con un patrimonio de £177 mil millones, se ha hecho cargo de la ciudad italiana para una boda cuyo coste se estima en £40 millones, una pequeña variación para el tercer hombre más rico del mundo. La hija de Donald Trump, Ivanka, y su esposo Jared Kushner también fueron vistos saliendo, después de llegar a una ciudad italiana el martes La fuente añadió: 'Cuando estaban planeando la boda, tenían claro que ya estaban casados en secreto. No existe solicitud de licencia de matrimonio por parte de la pareja porque no era obligatoria. 'Pase lo que pase en la boda del viernes, no será una boda. Según la legislación italiana, no será una celebración de bodas, cualquier voto dicho o anillo intercambiado no tendrá ningún significado legal La fuente agregó que Bezos había confirmado personalmente que él y Sánchez –quienes se conocieron cuando ambos estaban casados con otras personas– ya están legalmente casados, y que también habían firmado un acuerdo prenupcial para proteger su fortuna de 244 mil millones de dólares. La boda, celebrada dos años después de que Bezos le propusiera matrimonio a Sánchez a bordo de su superyate de 500 millones de dólares, fue descrita como ""extremadamente íntima"" con una estricta política de no usar teléfono: alrededor de 70 de los 200 invitados eran familiares. Las únicas imágenes que surgieron de las nupcias llegaron a través de la cuenta oficial de Instagram de Sánchez, y las fotos de los invitados saliendo de las celebraciones nocturnas eran escasas. Le reveló a Vogue que su vestido de novia estaba inspirado en el vestido de novia de encaje de cuello alto que usó Sophia Loren para casarse con Cary Grant en la película Houseboat de 1958. También reveló que Bezos le había rogado verla con el vestido, pero como es tradición para la mayoría de las novias, explicó que no iba a dejar que él lo viera hasta el gran día. «Casi cedí», admitió. -Pero quiero que sea una sorpresa. A medida que envejeces un poco, no te sorprenden muchas cosas. No puedo esperar a ver su cara.' Esta no fue la única tradición que mantuvo la pareja: Sánchez también se puso ""algo prestado"" para la ceremonia: un par de aretes Dolce. Y ella le explicó Vogue que su 'algo azul' era de su vuelo de Blue Origin, revelando que llevaba un recuerdo secreto en el cohete para poder traerlo de vuelta para Bezos 'porque fue una de las experiencias más profundas que he tenido en mi vida' Sánchez continuó: 'Viendo la Tierra desde el espacio, bajé y no pude describirla. ' Fue la mejor experiencia que he tenido jamás'. Se cree que la pareja Bezos gastó la asombrosa suma de 20 millones de dólares en su extravagante fiesta de bodas de varios días. Cuando los invitados llegaron a la recepción el viernes, fueron recibidos por los conmovedores sonidos de trompetas, violines y un conmovedor coro gospel. Ese mismo coro regresó para cantar Higher Love de Whitney Houston justo después de que la pareja intercambiara sus votos, con los invitados aplaudiendo y cantando durante el emotivo momento. El cantante de ópera Matteo Bocelli inició la recepción de la boda con un conmovedor homenaje, abriendo su set con el clásico atemporal de Elvis Presley I Can't Help Falling in Love With You. El hijo del reconocido tenor Andrea Bocelli intervino ya que su padre estaba ocupado con conciertos en el sur de Italia durante el fin de semana. Temprano en el día, el galardonado periodista Sánchez hizo una primera aparición elegante, saliendo del Aman Hotel de cinco estrellas con un sofisticado traje blanco de manga hinchada Dior, perfectamente equipado con un pañuelo en la cabeza y gafas de sol de gran tamaño. En las fotografías, mostró un nuevo y deslumbrante anillo de diamantes gigantes que llamó mucho la atención.

mov_30FBFC6356C93711D1DF87A75ED9EA6C,2025-06-29 14:09:16,en,WEB,"  Paris Fashion S/S 26 Louis Vuitton Beyonce, center, attends the men's Louis Vuitton Spring-Summer 2026 collection, that was presented in Paris, Tuesday, June 24, 2025. (AP Photo/Michel Euler)ASSOCIATED PRESS PARIS (AP) — If any force swept through the fashion industry this season — and sent shockwaves around the globe — it wasn't a new silhouette or a daring color. It was the spectacle of celebrity. Star power eclipsed fabric and form, transforming the runways of into arenas where A-list icons, K-pop idols, and digital megastars didn't just attend — they became the main event. As the week wraps up Sunday, it's clear: the world is watching not for what's worn, but for who's wearing it. and didn't just attend — they became the story. As they swept into the Pompidou Center, the entire mood shifted. Cameras flashed. Phones shot skyward. Even before the first look hit the runway, images of the couple rocketed around the globe. The scene encapsulated a truth that every major brand — from Louis Vuitton to Dior, Hermès to Saint Laurent — now understands: The real front row isn't in Paris, but on Instagram, TikTok and Weibo. And nothing sells quite like a star. Beyoncé's head-to-toe denim look — a custom Louis Vuitton creation by — sparked headlines worldwide and instantly set the tone for the season. Her ensemble, complete with a cowboy hat and Western belt, became one of the most shared images of fashion week, underlining just how quickly a star's wardrobe can ignite trends far beyond the runway. Her Cowboy Carter tour, however, hasn't been without controversy — referencing Buffalo Soldiers drew criticism online this week from some Indigenous and Mexican communities. And when Williams presented her with a Speedy bag straight from the runway, the moment went viral — striking a powerful note that Beyoncé isn't just an attendee, but the face of Louis Vuitton's creative vision. This is the new dynamic of luxury: The most coveted runway seat is now in your hand, and what matters most isn't just what you see, but who you see wearing it. It's a story that's been told before — celebrity eclipsing fashion — but in a year of global uncertainty, the urge for escapism and the power of star-driven fantasy have reached a new intensity. Show, not just tell: Fashion as spectacle What once was a private preview for buyers and editors is now a worldwide entertainment event. Designers don't just stage shows — they produce spectacles. Williams, Louis Vuitton's showman-in-chief, turned his runway into a snakes-and-ladders fantasy with a guest list to match: Beyoncé, Jay-Z, K-pop royalty J-Hope and Jackson Wang, reggaeton star Karol G, and Hollywood names like Bradley Cooper and Mason Thames. Each arrival triggered waves of posts and stories — making the crowd as newsworthy as the collection itself. The modern runway has become a stage for celebrity, where the applause is measured in views and viral moments, and the line between performer and spectator disappears. No other force is shifting menswear trends faster than K-pop. This season, stars like J-Hope, Jackson Wang, GOT7's Bambam, and NCT's Yuta were everywhere, livestreaming shows and igniting fashion frenzies from Seoul to Sao Paulo. These idols are both tastemakers and trend translators, instantly transmitting what they see in Paris to millions of fans. Their attendance has become a commercial event in itself, driving the adoption of new styles on a global scale. Beyoncé effect Even the clothes themselves now chase celebrity. Beyoncé's “Cowboy Carter” moment and Louis Vuitton's nod to Western style sent cowboy hats, flared denim, and rhinestone shirts trending worldwide. Brands scramble to turn these viral moments into wearable trends — knowing that what Queen Bey wears in Paris will be copied in malls and on apps within weeks. “We make fashion, but we're a house of travel,” Williams told reporters. In truth, it's the celebrity's journey through fashion that matters most. The old fashion cycle is gone. It's been said before. Where trends once took months to trickle down, now a celebrity-worn look can reach the high street soon after the show lights dim. TikTok and fast fashion brands move at the speed of the repost. At Hermès, even the discreet luxury of woven leather tees and wide trousers took on new meaning as athletes and music stars documented their attendance.

mov_F4799B21809A287CC815E1CCBA87ABDD,2025-06-29 14:09:16,en,WEB,"  PARIS (AP) — If any force swept through the fashion industry this season — and sent shockwaves around the globe — it wasn't a new silhouette or a daring color. It was the spectacle of celebrity. Star power eclipsed fabric and form, transforming the runways of Paris Fashion Week into arenas where A-list icons, K-pop idols, and digital megastars didn't just attend — they became the main event. As the week wraps up Sunday, it's clear: the world is watching not for what's worn, but for who's wearing it. Beyoncé and Jay-Z didn't just attend Louis Vuitton's blockbuster show — they became the story. As they swept into the Pompidou Center, the entire mood shifted. Cameras flashed. Phones shot skyward. Even before the first look hit the runway, images of the couple rocketed around the globe. The scene encapsulated a truth that every major brand — from Louis Vuitton to Dior, Hermès to Saint Laurent — now understands: The real front row isn't in Paris, but on Instagram, TikTok and Weibo. And nothing sells quite like a star. Beyoncé's head-to-toe denim look — a custom Louis Vuitton creation by Pharrell Williams — sparked headlines worldwide and instantly set the tone for the season. Her ensemble, complete with a cowboy hat and Western belt, became one of the most shared images of fashion week, underlining just how quickly a star's wardrobe can ignite trends far beyond the runway. Her Cowboy Carter tour, however, hasn't been without controversy — a T-shirt worn in Paris referencing Buffalo Soldiers drew criticism online this week from some Indigenous and Mexican communities. And when Williams presented her with a Speedy bag straight from the runway, the moment went viral — striking a powerful note that Beyoncé isn't just an attendee, but the face of Louis Vuitton's creative vision. This is the new dynamic of luxury: The most coveted runway seat is now in your hand, and what matters most isn't just what you see, but who you see wearing it. It's a story that's been told before — celebrity eclipsing fashion — but in a year of global uncertainty, the urge for escapism and the power of star-driven fantasy have reached a new intensity. Show, not just tell: Fashion as spectacle What once was a private preview for buyers and editors is now a worldwide entertainment event. More in Style Designers don't just stage shows — they produce spectacles. Williams, Louis Vuitton's showman-in-chief, turned his runway into a snakes-and-ladders fantasy with a guest list to match: Beyoncé, Jay-Z, K-pop royalty J-Hope and Jackson Wang, reggaeton star Karol G, and Hollywood names like Bradley Cooper and Mason Thames. Each arrival triggered waves of posts and stories — making the crowd as newsworthy as the collection itself. The modern runway has become a stage for celebrity, where the applause is measured in views and viral moments, and the line between performer and spectator disappears. No other force is shifting menswear trends faster than K-pop. This season, stars like J-Hope, Jackson Wang, GOT7's Bambam, and NCT's Yuta were everywhere, livestreaming shows and igniting fashion frenzies from Seoul to Sao Paulo. These idols are both tastemakers and trend translators, instantly transmitting what they see in Paris to millions of fans. Their attendance has become a commercial event in itself, driving the adoption of new styles on a global scale. Beyoncé effect Even the clothes themselves now chase celebrity. Beyoncé's “Cowboy Carter” moment and Louis Vuitton's nod to Western style sent cowboy hats, flared denim, and rhinestone shirts trending worldwide. Brands scramble to turn these viral moments into wearable trends — knowing that what Queen Bey wears in Paris will be copied in malls and on apps within weeks. “We make fashion, but we're a house of travel,” Williams told reporters. In truth, it's the celebrity's journey through fashion that matters most. The old fashion cycle is gone. It's been said before. Where trends once took months to trickle down, now a celebrity-worn look can reach the high street soon after the show lights dim. TikTok and fast fashion brands move at the speed of the repost. At Hermès, even the discreet luxury of woven leather tees and wide trousers took on new meaning as athletes and music stars documented their attendance.

wall338908668_73715,2025-06-29 14:37:35,ru,VK,"  SPR_COMBO[ru]41-летний американский режиссёр Роберт Эггерс, снявший Паттинсона и Уиллема Дефо в фильме ужасов 2019 года «Маяк» о паре смотрителей маяка XIX века, которые впадают в безумие, говорит, что «Роб любит делать неожиданные выбор, чтобы удивить своих партнёров по съёмочной площадке, и он не хочет использовать это без камеры. У Роба есть репетиционный процесс, но он проходит в его трейлере». Во время 35-дневных съёмок в Новой Шотландии Паттинсон, чей персонаж мастурбирует, думая о русалке, и которого съедает стая чаек, редко с кем-либо разговаривал на съёмочной площадке и большую часть времени проводил в одиночестве в тёмной палатке, отрабатывая гротескные мимические выражения. «Главное — постоянно помнить, в чём заключается твоя работа, — говорит он. — Это дисциплина — не тратить энергию ни на что другое». На обратном пути к дому друга Паттинсона сгущаются тучи, и он снимает солнцезащитные очки. Несмотря на то, что два его последних фильма, «Довод» и «Бэтмен», в совокупности собрали 1 миллиард долларов, а с 2013 года он является моделью Dior Homme, появляясь на рекламных щитах и автобусных остановках, он проходит мимо ряда оживлённых пабов незамеченным. Теперь, когда он стал старше, истерия утихла. «В том, чтобы быть свежим мясом, есть что-то особенное, — говорит он. — Они думали: «Ты даже не человек». Брюс Уэйн, промышленник из Готэм-сити, который мстит за убийство своих родителей, борясь с преступностью, — один из самых знаковых персонажей в кино. У Паттинсона до сих пор сохранился костюм, который он носил в детстве, но в новой версии, по крайней мере пока, он почти никогда не появляется без маски. «Это была моя единственная идея для Брюса», — говорит Паттинсон. «До сих пор его изображали плейбоем. Но что, если он совершенно не умеет общаться и страдает агорафобией?» Изображение Роберт Паттинсон стоит на фоне розового задника, заложив руки за голову. Поло Fendi за 1190 долларов и брюки за 890 долларов, fendi.com; а также винтажный свитер от стилиста.Кредит...Фотография Коллиера Шорра. Стил Джей Массакрет В «Бэтмене» есть сцена, в которой Брюс рассказывает Альфреду, своему дворецкому и наставнику, о бремени, которое несёт в себе его альтер-эго. «Если я не могу ничего изменить здесь, если я не могу повлиять на ситуацию, — говорит он, — мне всё равно, что со мной будет». Эта фраза запала в душу Паттинсону; он тоже явно задаётся вопросом, что бы произошло, если бы он перестал пытаться соответствовать созданному им образу или разрушил его. В какой-то момент он понял, что был всего лишь проекцией фантазий других людей. «Я прекрасно осознавал, — говорит он, — что на самом деле никто не думал обо мне.» Когда я спрашиваю Паттинсона, каким он был в детстве, он останавливается. «Я… не знаю», — отвечает он. В другой раз в нашем разговоре он сравнивает себя в молодости с прекрасной, но ничем не примечательной чашей, которую он вылепил: «Просто где-то там». Паттинсон вырос в Барнсе, красивом пригороде на юго-западе Лондона. Его мать, Клэр, была скаутом по поиску моделей. Его отец, Ричард, продавал винтажные автомобили. Он был средним учеником и плохо играл в спортивные игры, но ему нравилось слушать музыку и играть на музыкальных инструментах. «Больше всего я любил воровать», — говорит он, имея в виду порнографические журналы и шоколадные батончики. (Опять же, его истории бывает трудно подтвердить.) В 15 лет Паттинсон, у которого есть две старшие сестры, присоединился к местной театральной труппе. Вскоре после этого он успешно прошёл прослушивание на роль сына Риз Уизерспун в фильме Миры Наир «Ярмарка тщеславия» — экранизации романа Уильяма Мейкписа Теккерея о высшем английском обществе середины XIX века, вышедшей в 2004 году. Только после просмотра фильма на премьере он узнал, что его сцены были вырезаны из финальной версии. В следующем году кастинг-директор этого фильма, которому было жаль его, предложил ему роль волшебника в «Гарри Поттере и Кубке огня» Майка Ньюэлла. Примерно в то же время он и его друг детства Том Старридж, тоже актёр, сняли квартиру на Олд-Комптон-стрит в самом сердце Сохо. «Это была самая отвратительная квартира, которую я когда-либо видел», — с нежностью вспоминает Паттинсон. Он почти уверен, что они были пьяны, когда подписывали договор аренды. Каждый январь Паттинсон, у которого не было профессионального образования, ездил со Старриджем в Лос-Анджелес на съёмки пилотных эпизодов, но из этого ничего не вышло. Дома он почти каждую ночь играл на гитаре на открытых микрофонах по всему городу. Днём он проходил прослушивание для таких проектов, как «Троя» (2004) и «Форсаж: Токийский дрифт» (2006). Он опоздал и пришёл с разбитой губой — от поцелуя, а не от драки — на прослушивание на главную роль в фантастическом фильме «Эрагон» (2006). «Есть сцена, в которой он находит яйцо дракона, и это должен быть героический момент», — говорит актёр, который решил подойти к этому как к трагедии. «Я помню, как мой менеджер сказал, что они думали, что я под кайфом». Хотя в средней школе он позволял людям думать, что он наркоторговец, — ходили слухи, что он прятал свои запасы в дискетах, — он никогда не был таким диким, как некоторые его сверстники. «Раньше в Лос-Анджелесе было много вечеринок, — говорит он. — Мысль о том, чтобы сесть в машину на 15 минут, чтобы вообще куда-то добраться, заставляла меня оставаться дома. А потом ты совсем сходишь с ума». Изображение Роберт Паттинсон высовывается из окна машины. Dries Van Noten sweater, $560.Credit...Photograph by Collier Schorr...."

Und Innen Pure Eleganz, bisschen Dior Bitch Vibe, ihr kennt mich 🤣🫶🏼 Obwohl es eher Dolce ist 🙋🏻‍♀️😅 Haben uns für einen Stadtteil entschieden in der Nähe da, wo alles für mich mal begonnen hat. Nach 20 Jahren zurück in die Nähe meiner Wurzeln… und plötzlich ist alles neu. Heute erste kleine Tour gemacht, süße Cafés & Restaurants entdeckt und direkt ein bisschen verliebt. Patrick kennt das ja ja noch gar nicht und ich muss nach über 20 Jahren es neu kennenlernen 🤓 Wie würde Kim Virginia jetzt sagen? „Oh mein Gott, ob ich das alles schaffe? ! “ 😅 (Wartet ab, morgen erzähl ich euch, was heute schon wieder passiert ist… 🙃) und bald folgen erste Fotos und Videos.

Jonathan Anderson's debut was nothing short of revolutionary, blending abstract references with eclectic motifs like 18th-century art, Charles Baudelaire, and Basquiat. His exploration of personal style and the concept of the 'aristocrat' left a lasting impression, honoring Dior's rich heritage while infusing it with his unique vision. The venue, inspired by Berlin's Gemäldegalerie, set the stage for an unforgettable fusion of ancient and modern. Anderson's attention to detail, from the couture replicas of 18th-century men's wear to the intimate showcase of Jean Siméon Chardin's still lifes, underscored a debut that will echo through fashion history.

Svensk Parfym - Prakt • Smells like gooseberries, fresh air and childhood. Juicy, fresh and brilliant in the spring and summer. Dolce & Gabana - L'imperatrice • A unique fruity scent in that kiwi/rhubarb freshness. Doesn't last particularly long but smells awesome. Giorgio Armani - Ocean di Gioia • Smells like sweet pear and salty air. Really good refreshing scent. Valentino - Donna Born in Roma Gold • Smells like a pretty girl on a tropical vacation. It's primarily gardenia and the citrus and coconut just round it out. Le Labo - Another 13 • Smells like the sweat of a sexy person to me, which may not sound appealing but it really is. It's sexy but in a light and airy way. Andrea Mack - Ceramic • Smells like fabric softener. Slightly sweet, clean and very pleasant. DS & Durga - Debaser • Bright, juicy fig and notes of green notes come across the most. It feels sophisticated to me. Stephane Humbert Lucas - Pink Boa • This is a sweltering hot weather scent. It's really cooling and refreshing, like a pink G&T or shower gel. Vilhelm Parfumerie - Dear Polly • Smells like green apple and black tea. Really fresh but not super long lasting. Narcotica - Narco Oasis • This is a ""I'm a gourmand girl but it's too hot to smell like vanilla cake right now"" scent. It's sweet, juicy, delicious but because it's passionfruity it comes across lighter and not cloying By Kilian - Flower of Immortality • Subtle, juicy peach and delicate floral. . Honourable mention here to PDM - Valaya and Meliora which feel similar to me, also JHAG - Magnolia Bliss. All clean, juicy fruity florals. J-Scent - Yawahada • The only milky scent I've found that works in heat without being too thick. The pear is delicate and juicy and the milk note is quiet but adds a lovely creaminess. Jeroboam - Floro • Fruity, musky. Similar to Valaya but pineapple and apple instead of peach. Phlur - Father Figure. Light fresh dewy fig. Masculine leaning. Vilhelm Parfumerie - Opus Kore • Acai berry note, really juicy and kind of reminds me of shampoo. Atelier des Ors - Pink Me Up • Date night rose for warmer months. Dark and jammy but not too heavy. Maison Crivelli - Rose Saltifolia • Salty sweet fresh rose. Beautiful daytime at the beach restaurant scent. Bjork and Berries - Never Spring • Reminds me of lemonade in the opening. Sweet and citrusy. Dior - Dioriviera • Light, dewy airy fig and rose. Malin&Goetz - Strawberry • Woody fresh, like a field of strawberries or taking a big sniff of an unripe strawberry.

Story i posted in previous thread: He was running an invis M40 flash platoon to take out some DIOR colossus. Mission failed and he got really mad. Our platoon punishment was to venture out to the middle of the Indar desert and do target practice at a big rock (that resembled a collosus) for 20 minutes with our M40 flashes. Then he logged off to go get BBQ ribs or something. On Cobalt NC he was always calling me a CRII cheater when I killed him. On another VS alt of mine that was in CBMC he was pretty chill most of the time."

18050848610392067,2025-06-29 18:14:15,en,INSTAGRAM,"  I just created two completely different Dior campaigns in under 30 minutes. Same product. Completely different audiences. One feels like your best friend showing you their favorite find. The other? High-end magazine spread. Here's what most people miss about AI product photography: It's not about replacing one expensive shoot. It's about replacing hundreds of them. Every e-commerce brand drowns in content demands: Daily posts. Email campaigns. Seasonal refreshes. Different demographics. Different platforms. Different moods. Traditional approach? $5K per shoot. Maybe 30 images. Brands need 300+ monthly to feed their content machine. Plus they're stuck with whatever they shot. Same lighting. Same mood. Same concept. AI lets you create unlimited unique variations. Different worlds. Different aesthetics. Different impossible scenarios. The math doesn't work with traditional shoots. They're either hemorrhaging money on constant shoots or recycling stale images. That's why this skill is pure gold. Problem is as most of you know, AI tools suck at product photography. ChatGPT warps products. Midjourney gets details wrong. But I've developed a method that works consistently. Brands can't tell what's real anymore. Whether you're freelancing or training teams - this skill pays premium. My complete system launches module one on July 6th. Images, video, consistency, client acquisition - everything. Pre-sale available now. Massive discount. Payment plans included.

951445608dda4147241db8cd8e16384f,2025-06-29 18:32:00,en,WEB,"  With his new full length album CYCLES , multi-platinum artist Iann Dior is entering a new era, one defined by emotional honesty, musical freedom, and a deliberate turn away from perfection. Released June 13th via Big Noise, the album sees the Puerto Rico born, LA based artist blending his signature cocktail of alternative, hip-hop, rock, and pop into something raw, self reflective, and more unfiltered than ever before. “ I just wanted it to feel more authentic,” Iann tells Noctis Magazine, reflecting on the creative process behind CYCLES. “ When it's too polished, it loses that honesty. I've grown a lot, and this time around I wasn't afraid to let people hear the imperfections. That's where the real emotion lives. ” That vulnerability runs through the heart of the project, from the synth heavy summer-ready standout 'SIX FEET' (produced by Travis Barker), to the smooth, R&B tinged 'TALK ABOUT IT,' featuring rising artist Blaxian. Lead single 'TATTOOS & U' is perhaps the biggest burst of energy, a swaggering track with an equally kinetic video shot guerrilla-style on the streets of NYC while on tour. “ We rented a cab and drove all across New York the night of my show, ” he recalls. “ We captured the energy of the city. That song came from a chaotic but meaningful place, and filming it like that made it feel even more real .” This theme of movement, both literal and emotional, is embedded in the DNA of CYCLES. Dior describes the album as both an ending and a beginning. “ To me, I just dropped an Iann album. That's really it, ” he says. “ It's a moment in time, closing one chapter and stepping into whatever's next, without overthinking it. I'm just showing up as myself. ” I've grown a lot, and this time around I wasn't afraid to let people hear the imperfections. That's where the real emotion lives That sense of presence is something he's bringing to the stage as well. Currently in the midst of a North American headline tour, Iann is set to hit major festivals this summer including Warped Tour in Long Beach on July 26 – 27th. With CYCLES being his most personal project to date, there's a different kind of anticipation around performing the songs live. “ We'll have to see ,” he says of the upcoming festival shows. “ I've put a lot of myself into this new material, so I'm excited to feel how that energy hits when it's live. There's a different kind of connection when a crowd hears something real .” Over the years, Iann has consistently sidestepped expectations, shape shifting between emo rap, pop-punk, trap-pop, and more. His collaborative resume includes the likes of Machine Gun Kelly, Lil Baby, Gunna, and of course, 24kGoldn, their 7x Platinum hit 'Mood' still sits comfortably in the cultural canon, recently earning a spot on Billboard's Top 100 Songs of the Century. Still, Iann shrugs off genre labels entirely these days. “ Genres are irrelevant. I just make what I feel, whatever sounds like me in the moment. That freedom is where the best stuff comes from .” That creative fluidity extends far beyond music. A staple in fashion circles and a former face of MCM's Spring/Summer 2022 campaign, Iann was also named to Forbes' prestigious “30 Under 30” list in 2021. He sees the connection between sound and style as seamless. “ I think the diversity in what I like to wear reflects the diversity in the music I make ,” he says. “ They're both expressions of who I am, always changing, always pushing boundaries, but still me .” At the core of CYCLES is a quiet but powerful shift: a decision to stop chasing outside validation and start chasing truth. “ There wasn't one big moment ,” Iann reflects. “ It's more like a slow shift. I just stopped caring about the noise and started caring more about how I feel when I make something. That's the only thing that matters now. ” And maybe that's what makes this chapter in Iann Dior's story feel different. CYCLES doesn't strive to be perfect, it just wants to be real. As CYCLES marks a new chapter for Iann Dior, it also solidifies his place as an artist unafraid to evolve in public. Stripped of the need to please or conform, he's leaning into something deeper: honesty without the filter. Whether it's through a genre blurring track, a midnight video shoot in NYC, or a live set fuelled by raw emotion, Iann is showing up as his most authentic self, and inviting listeners to do the same.

Pada hari Sabtu (28/6/2025), mantan jurnalis berusia 55 tahun itu mengenakan gaun georgette tanpa tali dari Atelier Versace yang dilengkapi sulaman jala kristal untuk pesta “Dolce Notte,” yang berarti “Malam yang Manis.” Gaun rias yang serasi terbuat dari sifon sutra dan korset yang disulam tangan dengan kristal Swarovski emas mawar, perunggu, dan emas. Rambut cokelat Lauren Sanchez ditata terurai dengan gelombang longgar dan ia memadukan penampilannya dengan anting-anting berlian. Sementara itu, pendiri Amazon mengenakan setelan serba hitam yang ramping dan kacamata hitam yang serasi.

Mereka dilaporkan diminta mengenakan pakaian tidur versi mereka sendiri berupa lingerie dan piyama. Kylie Jenner dan Kendall Jenner sudah terlihat dalam perjalanan menuju pesta luar biasa Sabtu malam. Mereka masing-masing memiliki interpretasi berbeda tentang aturan berpakaian. Pendiri Kylie Cosmetics (27) memilih atasan ketat berwarna perak dan rok putih, sementara saudara perempuannya yang seorang supermodel (29) memilih gaun yang lebih sopan yang dirancang oleh Thierry Mugler dalam nuansa ungu yang mencolok. Ibu mereka, Kris Jenner, mengenakan setelan bercorak lingkaran warna abu-abu dan putih yang nyaman serta boa bulu hitam yang lembut untuk pesta setelahnya. Wanita berusia 69 tahun itu memadukan penampilannya dengan tatanan rambut yang rapi dan kacamata hitam.

Pada hari Kamis, pilot helikopter berusia 55 tahun itu memeriahkan acara, menghadiri pesta penyambutan dengan mengenakan gaun Schiaparelli Haute Couture yang menampilkan pinggang berkorset dan sulaman bunga pada bagian rok. Dan, pada hari besarnya, sang pengantin pertama kali keluar dari hotelnya dengan mengenakan setelan rok Dior dan melilitkan rambutnya dengan syal sutra sebelum ia berjalan menuju lorong dengan gaun lengan panjang Dolce & Gabbana yang dibuat khusus, terinspirasi oleh Sophia Loren dalam “Houseboat.” (*) KEYWORD :"

mov_2F623CEE86B331C8EC22E9E1E2CF70CA,2025-06-29 18:51:52,en,WEB,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Reese Witherspoon's nepo baby Ava Phillippe and her live-in love Dakota Brubaker made their official red carpet debut as a couple while attending Charlize Theron's Africa Outreach Project (CTAOP) 5th Annual Block Party in Universal City, CA on Saturday. The 25-year-old LBI Entertainment model and the Vindigo frontman (who's around 26) previously went Instagram official on December 3, and they just celebrated their one-year anniversary of dating on June 20. Ava - who's named after Ava Gardner - repped her own $298 yellow AQUA x Ava Phillippe 'Embellished V Neck Cami' gown and gave her 5ft2in frame a big boost with silver peep-toe platform heels. Phillippe never removed her new favorite Miu Miu sunglasses, she styled her brunette mane in waves, and she showcased her tattooed sleeves. Dakota looked preppy in a beige linen suit over a white crewneck top, along with a black belt and Oxfords. The benefit featured a Hot Ones 'Truth or Dab' recreation onstage with the 49-year-old Oscar winner and Sean Evans as well as a special performance from Mean Girls star Reneé Rapp. Attendees also enjoyed a putting green, cornhole, foosball tables, and several sponsored booths held on the Universal Studios Backlot. At one point, the inseparable couple chatted up Yellowjackets actress Nuha Jes Izman. On June 19, Brubaker uploaded a TikTok video of himself and Ava playing Rock Paper Scissors in order to decide who got to choose what they watched together that night. The Future People singer won and chose Seth Gordon's 2008 holiday rom-com Four Christmases starring Reese and Vince Vaughn, and Phillippe scoffed: 'Babe, it's June.' The UC Berkeley sweethearts are already co-parenting two adopted dogs - Birdie and Benji - and on June 7, Dakota revealed they had officially moved in together in a TikTok captioned: 'You'll be married in a year in the suburbs or something like that.' Despite Ava studying social sciences at college, she is now following in the footsteps of her famous folks and scored two guest-starring acting gigs that aired last April. Phillippe portrayed Veronica, who lusts after Dr. Max Bankman (Joshua Jackson), in the April 3rd episode - titled 'Spring Break' - of ABC's Doctor Odyssey alongside fellow nepo babies Charlotte Lawrence and Paris Jackson. 'It was such a learning experience, and, also the whole time, I was kind of distracted by Ryan Murphy's world building — it's insane,' the ICE out of LA activist gushed to New Beauty at the time. 'He's the king of television, and it was such a privilege to be on the set and to learn from other actors who I really admire and to get to work with Josh and Kathyrn [Newton, who played Witherspoon's daughter on Big Little Lies] was super cool and a full circle moment because they worked with my parents.' Ava also portrayed the teenage version of Josh Duhamel's late onscreen wife Amalah for a flashback in the April 17th episode - titled 'By the Grace of God' - of Netflix's Ransom Canyon. 'I was in college studying social sciences, and I really started to realize how big of a toll it was taking on me to neglect my creativity,' Phillippe explained. 'I was ready to explore new mediums and psychology and sociology are such a huge part of my interests, and acting is a really great way to tie that into my creativity, which I wasn't expecting, and I didn't think I would like it as much as I do. To be honest, I didn't pick my parents' brains as much as I should have, and now I'm learning a lot and finding my own way with it, which is really rewarding.' The Kamala Harris supporter's 21-year-old brother Deacon Phillippe portrayed Christian Maddox alongside their father Ryan Phillippe in the coming-of-age drama Motorheads, which is currently ranked No. 10 on Amazon Prime Video's top 10 TV shows as of Sunday - according to Flix Patrol. The Cruel Intentions couple divorced in 2007 after seven years of marriage. Ava began her modeling career at age 19 in 2018 for Rodarte's Fall lookbook. Phillippe went on to star in campaigns for Ivy Park, Pat McGrath Labs, and Vince Camuto as well as the 49-year-old Oscar winner's clothing company, Draper James. The Planned Parenthood campaigner is also every bit the influencer with paid partnerships for brands like Vince Camuto, Michael Kors, Dior Beauty, Fendi, Clarins, and Golden Goose. Meanwhile, Dakota - who earned a BA in cognitive science and a minor in journalism - has been hard at work taking acting classes and recording his first-ever full-length studio album."
tw_sl_998114423fc58b33a89952b3b8554302,2025-06-29 19:14:49,en,WEB,"  PARIS — If any force dominated the global fashion industry this season — eclipsing fabric, form and even the wildest silhouettes — it was the spectacle of celebrity. In a year marked by global anxiety and a hunger for fantasy, star power flooded Paris Fashion Week, turning runways into gladiator arenas where A-list icons, K-pop idols and digital megastars became the main event. Beyoncé and Jay-Z didn't just attend Louis Vuitton's blockbuster show — they became the show. As they swept into the Pompidou Center, cameras flashed and phones shot skyward. Before the first look even hit the runway, images of the couple ricocheted across the globe. K-pop idols like J-Hope and Jackson Wang livestreamed their arrival to millions, while crowds outside flooded social feeds with every glimpse of a star. As the industry's spring season wraps up Sunday, it's clear: Fashion's global audience is focused less on what's worn and more on who's wearing it. Explore More This interplay between celebrity and fashion is hardly new, but in 2025, the desire for escapism and star-driven spectacle is peaking like never before. “It's about celebrity clickbait, and it's at a tipping point now. Celebrities have replaced the designers and stylists as the tastemakers,” said Anna Barr, a fashion magazine editor who attended shows. Beyoncé's appearance this week encapsulated a truth that every major brand — from Louis Vuitton to Dior, Hermès to Saint Laurent — now understands: The real front row isn't in Paris, but on Instagram, TikTok and Weibo. And nothing sells quite like a star. Beyoncé's denim look goes viral The pop star's head-to-toe denim — custom Louis Vuitton by Pharrell Williams — wasn't just viral. Within 24 hours, clips of her arrival amassed millions of views on TikTok, outpacing even Louis Vuitton's own campaign content. When Williams presented her with a Speedy bag straight from the runway in the Paris dusk, the moment went viral — underlining that Beyoncé isn't just an attendee, but a face of Louis Vuitton's creative vision. But even as Beyoncé's look became the week's most shared image, her presence in Paris also sparked debate: a Buffalo Soldiers T-shirt she wore during her “Cowboy Carter” tour ignited criticism from some Indigenous and Mexican communities, reminding the industry that every viral moment can be a flash point. This is the new dynamic of luxury: The most coveted runway seat is now in your hand, and what matters most isn't just what you see, but who you see wearing it. Show, not just tell: Fashion as spectacle What once was a private preview for buyers and editors is now a worldwide entertainment event. Designers don't just stage shows — they produce spectacles. Williams, Louis Vuitton's showman-in-chief, turned his runway into a snakes-and-ladders fantasy with a guest list to match: Beyoncé, Jay-Z, K-pop royalty J-Hope and Jackson Wang, reggaeton star Karol G, and Hollywood names like Bradley Cooper and Mason Thames. Each arrival triggered waves of posts and stories — making the crowd as newsworthy as the collection itself. The modern runway has become a stage for celebrity, where the applause is measured in views and viral moments, and the line between performer and spectator disappears. No other force is shifting menswear trends faster than K-pop. This season, stars like J-Hope, Jackson Wang, GOT7's Bambam, and NCT's Yuta were everywhere, livestreaming shows and igniting fashion frenzies from Seoul to Sao Paulo. These idols are both tastemakers and trend translators, instantly transmitting what they see in Paris to millions of fans. Their attendance has become a commercial event in itself, driving the adoption of new styles on a global scale. 'Queen Bey' effect Even the clothes themselves now chase celebrity. Beyoncé's “Cowboy Carter” moment and Louis Vuitton's nod to Western style sent cowboy hats, flared denim, and rhinestone shirts trending worldwide. Brands scramble to turn these viral moments into wearable trends — knowing that what Queen Bey wears in Paris will be copied in malls and on apps within weeks. “We make fashion, but we're a house of travel,” Williams told reporters. In truth, it's the celebrity's journey through fashion that matters most. The old fashion cycle is gone. It's been said before. Where trends once took months to trickle down, now a celebrity-worn look can reach the high street soon after the show lights dim. TikTok and fast fashion brands move at the speed of the repost. At Hermès, even the discreet luxury of woven leather tees and wide trousers took on new meaning as athletes and music stars documented their attendance. Their posts quickly turn exclusive details into mass-market “must-haves.” Shein and Temu, the global fast-fashion juggernauts, have weaponized the viral moment — turning celebrity sightings into shoppable trends worldwide, sometimes in a matter of hours. The result: What debuts on the Paris catwalk can show up in online shopping carts from Atlanta to Addis Ababa almost instantly. Beneath the celebrity glow, classic trends endure. Streetwear is still king, with oversized silhouettes, soft tailoring and activewear influences everywhere from Dior to Dolce & Gabbana. The Hermès “cool city guy” and Dolce's pajama dressing — rumpled but rich — are direct answers to how men want to live and move now. But even these trends go mainstream through star power, not just design. The models might debut the look, but it's the front-row faces who make it stick. The celebrity ascendancy isn't just a front-row phenomenon — it's woven into the industry itself. When LVMH 's Bernard Arnault tapped Williams, a global pop icon, to lead Louis Vuitton menswear in 2023, it wasn't just a creative risk...."
1lnnejv,2025-06-29 19:34:12,en,REDDIT,"  Hi! So, I'm kind of a Baby Bat—I only discovered the Gothic aesthetic/fashion about a month or two ago, and I've been obsessed ever since. I'm gonna start researching more about it this summer as school is out for me. The thing is, I'm not sure if I'm fully Goth. I absolutely love the outfits, but I'm also really drawn to other aesthetics like Dark Academia, Gloomy Coquette, Old Money, and more. I'm not sure if those styles really fall under the Gothic umbrella, though. I've always loved dark, creepy, and mysterious things, and I adore clothing in general—especially luxurious items like Dior, Chanel, and Lululemon (even though I don't own any, I've always had a love for expensive stuff). I've seen a lot about thrifting in the Goth community, but I'm a bit nervous about it. I care a lot about my skin and worry about things like skin diseases or rashes from used clothes. Plus, I honestly don't know how to thrift properly. I'm also not sure how or if my favorite aesthetics can blend with the Gothic style. I like some mainstream brands too, like Brandy Melville and things on Amazon—but I've heard people say it's unethical to shop at certain places, and now I'm confused about what's ""allowed"" in the Goth scene. Most of the Gothic styles I see are Trad Goth, Romantic, Cyber, etc., so I don't know if I really ""fit in."" I do enjoy Gothic music—some songs, not all—and overall, I just don't know what to label myself. Am I really Goth? Or something else? I'm still figuring it all out. I would really like some advice on what's wrong and what's right as a lot of goth brands are not really acceptable in the community and there's seems to be a lot of rules that come with it as well. Thank you in advance"
n0gk2jf,2025-06-29 19:50:45,en,REDDIT,"  A majority of the book is being told the story. The second book features a major twist in how the story is delivered and you do get to see more plot in the 'present day'. But we're talking like a 90/10 split between past/present. I had a theory we'd be dealing with one major vampire family per book, but the blurb for book 3 sounds very final. We haven't seen much of Ilon at all and only Chastain in 'present day' and the book implies a final bout with the forever king (Voss). I'll be sad if a lot of lore is left on the table. Either way I'm strapped in for the ride. Book 3 blurb: >! Unbeknownst to the Last Silversaint, the Grail still lives—speeding towards the besieged capital of Augustin in the frail hope of ending Daysdeath. But deadly treachery awaits within the halls of power, and the Forever King's legions march ever closer. Gabriel and Dior will be drawn into a final battle that will shape the very fate of the Empire, but as the sun sets for what may the last time, there will be no one left for them to trust. ! < >! Not even each other. ! <"

Après trois jours de célébrations hors de prix, les invités du mariage de Jeff Bezos et Lauren Sanchez ont quitté la Cité des Doges ce dimanche. Acteurs, chanteurs sportifs, grands patrons, stars de téléréalité…. Ils étaient 200 à avoir ""le privilège"" d'assister à l'union entre le fondateur d'Amazon et l'ancienne journaliste télé. Controversée en raison de sa démesure et de son empreinte carbone, la noce a donné lieu à plusieurs manifestations. Et une poignée d'images fortes que TF1Info a sélectionnées pour vous. Un marié aux anges Les critiques ? Il s'en moque comme de sa dernière Rolex ! Six ans après avoir divorcé de la romancière MacKenzie Scott, la mère de ses quatre enfants, Jeff Bezos a convolé pour la deuxième fois avec Lauren Sanchez à Venise. Depuis leur rencontre, le fondateur d'Amazon et l'ex-journaliste télé forment un ""power couple"" comme on en voit d'ordinaire à Hollywood. Et pour accueillir leurs prestigieux invités, ils avaient mis les petits plats dans les grands. Coût estimé de la noce ? 40 millions d'euros. Une mariée très inspirée C'est à la maison italienne Dolce & Gabbana que Lauren Sanchez avait commandé sa robe de mariée. Col montant et manches longues en dentelles, c'est la réplique que celle que portait Sofia Loren dans La Péniche du Bonheur, un film de 1957 qui voyait la star italienne épouser le séducteur américain Cary Grant. Un sosie presque parfait Il s'appelle Cagdas Halicilar, il est Allemand. Et depuis bientôt un an, il a quitté son job d'électricien pour devenir sosie officiel de Jeff Bezos ! Profitant de la noce du siècle, il s'est invité à Venise où il a multiplié les apparitions. ""Je ne parle pas beaucoup, je prends des photos avec tout le monde, je les remercie et je m'en vais"", a-t-il raconté au DailyMail. Aux dernières nouvelles, il a vient de décrocher un rôle dans une série comique sur Netflix.   La casquette de Leonardo Habitué des sorties mondaines, de Los Angeles à la Croisette, Leonardo DiCaprio se doutait bien qu'il allait être traqué par les paparazzis. Son obstination à dissimuler son visage sous une casquette de baseball, même en tenue de soirée, a suscité les moqueries des internautes. On espère juste qu'elle ne l'a pas empêché de voir sa girfriend, le mannequin italien Victoria Cerretti. La best life des Kardashian C'est la famille Kardashian au grand complet qui a débarqué à Venise pour assister à la noce du siècle. Kim et Khloé Kardashian, leur demi-sœur Kendall Jenner et leur mère Kris ont multiplié les apparitions tout le week-end. Sous le charme unique de  la cité des Doges, elles ont enchaîné les selfies comme des touristes ordinaires, ou presque. Ivanka Trump en émissaire Entre Jeff Bezos et Donald Trump, les relations n'ont pas toujours été au beau fixe. Pas plus tard qu'en avril dernier, Amazon avait menacé d'afficher la part des droits de douane imposés par le président américain sur ses produits importés de Chine, avant de faire machine arrière après un coup de fil salé de la Maison-Blanche. Preuve du réchauffement entre les deux camps : la présence à Venise de Ivanka Trump, la fille du président, et de son mari l'homme d'affaires Jared Kushner. Sydney Sweeney affole les paparazzis C'est l'une des actrices les plus demandées du moment à Hollywood. Révélée par la série Euphoria, la comédienne américaine de 27 ans faisait partie de la jeune génération des invités du mariage de Jeff Bezos et Lauren Sanchez. Fraichement séparée de son fiancé de longue date, l'homme d'affaires Jonathan Davino, elle a été aperçue en train de faire la fête jusqu'au bout de la nuit avec le footballeur américain Tom Brady, de vingt ans son aîné. Orlando Bloom célibataire C'est l'info people de la semaine. Après neuf ans de fiançailles, Katy Perry et Orlando Bloom ont annoncé officiellement leur séparation, quelques heures avant leur mariage de leurs amis Lauren Sanchez et Jeff Bezos. Alors que la chanteuse avait accompagné la journaliste lors de son bref voyage dans l'espace en mars dernier, elle ne s'est pas rendue à la noce, officiellement retenue sur sa tournée mondiale. L'acteur en revanche, avait fait le déplacement. On l'a notamment aperçu faire la fête en compagnie de Jamie Mizrahi… la styliste de son ex.  Des patrons français invités Parmi les 200 convives ne figuraient que trois personnalités françaises. Et pas n'importe lesquels. Jeff Bezos avait en effet convié François-Henri Pinault, le big boss du groupe Kering, venu dans la cité des Doges sans son épouse, la comédienne américano-mexicaine Salma Hayek. Delphine Arnault, présidente de Christian Dior Couture et membre du conseil d'administration du groupe LVHM, mais aussi Xavier Niel, le PDG de Free, avaient également fait le déplacement pour assister à la noce du siècle...."

Your argument would be the same as all Dior and Hermes bags are fakes or homages since LV did it before.

mov_F21EF00C8D165025D765E65C30403708,2025-06-29 22:02:31,en,WEB,"  Newlyweds Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos leave their luxury wedding to embark on a multi-million dollar honeymoon at a famous hotel featured on The White Lotus season two Lauren Sanchez and Jeff Bezos are rumoured to set sail on a luxury trip for their honeymoon after they tied the knot last week in a three-day multi-million dollar wedding celebration in Venice. The billionaire couple haven't publicly confirmed where they are going for their honeymoon, but a source has claimed they will stay in the area of Torcello before heading to Nicelli airport. The newlyweds are said to fly in a helicopter back to Bezos' $500 million superyacht, 'Koru,' where they will move on to Taormina in Sicily. The Daily Mail have reported that the couple fell in love with the town last year when they sailed along Sicily's coast and the Aeolian Islands. It is reported that Jeff and Lauren will anchor in Taormina and spend some time together at Four Seasons San Domenico Palace. The magnificent hotel is famous for being the primary location of The White Lotus season 2 and a suite can cost upwards of €7,000 a night. The hotel website states: “Perched on a rocky promontory high above the Ionian Sea, San Domenico Palace, an exclusive five-star luxury hotel in Taormina, invites you to experience the charm of a reimagined 14th-century Sicilian convent.” Before setting off, the newlyweds were snapped beaming and waving goodbye as they left the Aman Venice hotel by boat on Sunday. Lauren cut a smart figure in a white dress with an elegant drape. She finished the look with a black hat and some stylish oversized sunglasses. Hubby Jeff looked just as smart in a navy t-shirt and sunglasses. Article continues below On 27 June, the couple exchanged vows at the stunning San Giorgio Maggiore island, set against Venice's iconic lagoon. The ceremony unfolded in a black‑tie garden event—Lauren arrived in a cream Dior suit before switching into a custom Dolce & Gabbana lace gown, inspired by Sophia Loren and crafted over 900 hours. Around 200 high‑profile guests arrived by water taxi to witness the nuptials, including Oprah Winfrey, Kim & Kylie Jenner, Leonardo DiCaprio, Bill Gates, Tom Brady, Usher and Orlando Bloom. Shortly after the wedding, Lauren changed her Instagram handle to @laurensanchezbezos, confirming the newlyweds' joy to the world. The couple took three days out of their busy schedule to celebrate their wedding, which is believed to have cost close to £40million. And while the happy couple and their guests enjoyed the celebrations which went without a hitch, it seems not everybody was pleased that the retail giant had booked out the entire Italian city. An estimated 700 demonstrators gathered together at Santa Lucia train station armed with banners that read ""If you can rent Venice for your wedding, you can pay more tax."" Article continues below The demonstration is believed to have been organised by the No Space For Bezos group. A few members of the group were seen laden with Amazon boxes that had the words ""ordered, shipped, delivered, rejected"" written on them."

1lnuzz2,2025-06-30 01:18:04,en,REDDIT,"  **Introduction to Designer Merk Tassen** Designer **Merk Tassen**—branded designer bags—have long been regarded as the pinnacle of fashion and elegance. These high-end accessories are more than just functional items; they are icons of luxury, craftsmanship, and personal style. Whether it's a timeless Chanel flap bag, a chic Louis Vuitton Speedy, or a minimalist tote from a Scandinavian label, designer bags hold a unique status in the fashion world. In an age where visual identity and self-expression matter more than ever, a designer Merk Tas represents not only aesthetic value but also social status, attention to detail, and appreciation for artistry. **Craftsmanship and Premium Materials** One of the defining features of [**designer Merk Tassen**](https://www.merk-tassen.nl/) is the exceptional **craftsmanship** and use of **premium materials**. These bags are often handmade or produced in limited quantities to maintain quality. From soft calfskin leather and Italian suede to vegan leather and ethically sourced fabrics, each material is carefully selected to match the brand's values and design philosophy. Details such as precision stitching, custom metal hardware, and embossed logos showcase the level of effort and expertise involved. This superior construction ensures that designer bags are not only stylish but also highly durable, often becoming cherished heirlooms passed down through generations. ! [img](8i9q9rd8uy9f1) **Popular Designer Brands and Their Signature Styles** Designer Merk Tassen come in countless styles, each with its own distinct personality and story. **Luxury fashion houses** like **Hermès, Chanel, Prada, Gucci, Dior, and Louis Vuitton** have crafted signature designs that are instantly recognizable worldwide. The Hermès Birkin, for example, is a symbol of ultimate exclusivity and craftsmanship, while the Chanel Classic Flap Bag blends femininity with timeless appeal. Meanwhile, emerging designer brands like **BY FAR, Staud, and JW Pei** are reshaping the industry with modern, accessible luxury options. Dutch and European designers, such as **O My Bag** and **MYOMY**, bring sustainable innovation into the spotlight, combining ethics with high fashion. **Why Designer Merk Tassen Are Worth the Investment** Though often priced at a premium, designer Merk Tassen are considered **valuable investments**. Many luxury bags not only retain their value over time but can actually **increase in worth**, especially limited-edition or vintage pieces. Beyond resale potential, the daily joy of owning and using a high-quality bag is incomparable. These bags elevate any outfit and give a sense of confidence and sophistication. Furthermore, buyers today are more discerning—they look for **brands that align with their values**, be it sustainability, craftsmanship, or social responsibility. Designer Merk Tassen offer a combination of prestige and purpose, making them highly desirable in a fashion-savvy market. **The Future of Designer Merk Tassen** As the fashion industry evolves, so too does the world of designer Merk Tassen. The future points toward **innovation, personalization, and sustainability**. Brands are embracing eco-friendly production methods, offering customizable elements like monogramming, and incorporating tech features like built-in phone chargers or anti-theft trackers. Additionally, the rise of **secondhand luxury platforms** has made designer bags more accessible, allowing a broader audience to participate in the world of high-end fashion. Whether purchased new or pre-owned, a designer Merk Tas will remain a powerful accessory—a timeless fusion of beauty, quality, and identity in an ever-changing world of style."

E.l.f.'s Hydrating Core Lip Shine (specifically, the ""Ecstatic"" shade), a must-buy for fans of Clinique's ""Black Honey,"" lippie. It's nearly $20 cheaper (wowza!) and while it doesn't shift colors *quite* as magically, the shade is fantastic, has a nonsticky formula, and is a great option to keep in your bag when you want to craft a similar look on the go. BuzzFeed writer Emma Lord keeps this version stocked and on-hand, ""I personally will live, breathe, and die by the magic of $25 ""universal"" Black Honey version — it lasts FOREVER and also functions as the perfect blush — but it sells out so often that I am also deeply relieved to know it has a cheap alternative in case of a lip emergency!"" Promising review: ""I absolutely love this product. The dark color is perfectly sheer. It also adds the most beautiful color to your lips. I am a Clinique Black Honey lip fan, and this gives me the same look for a fraction of the cost. I love it and have several that I keep in various spots. Not sticky either, which is my biggest gripe about lip glosses. My hair doesn't get stuck in this like some glosses, but I get the shine."" —Hamps5 Get it from Amazon for $7 (also available in eight other shades). 2. Catrice ""Instant Awake"" Under Eye Brightener — toss your old concealer aside! This one has become the internet's holy grail for concealing and brightening dark circles under your eyes so fast that everyone's old concealers are doing double takes. This lightweight color-adapting formula is designed for truly ~invisible~ coverage that makes a drastic difference. The color-adaptive formula is designed so one of two shades will work on any skin tone. I've personally tested this out and it has become an essential part of my daily routine. As a mom of two I gotta just say I am TIRED. So tired that I'm not sure what my face even looks like without bags under my eyes — that is, unless I've got the Catrice ""Instant Awake"" on. A little really goes a long way and has great coverage. I wore it throughout my sister's wedding weekend in Aruba and, despite the heat, it stayed perfectly in place. An incredible product for an even more incredible price... 10/10 from me. Promising review: ""Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it."" —Monica T. Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades). 3. A bouquet of Lego roses you'll likely enjoy assembling and appreciate much more than a vase filled with living florals that will, sadly, die in a few days. The set comes with 12 roses and 4 sprigs of baby's breath. Promising review: ""I've fallen in love with every LEGO Botanical Collection and this is no exception. Beautifully created."" —Kelly S. Get it from Amazon for $50.15. 4. Or a bunch of faux tulips (with nearly 17,000 5-star ratings!!!) that'll ensure your home has a touch of florals ALL the time — *and* if you go on vacation, they'll still be standing beautifully when you return. Promising review: ""They look so real, and I get a ton of compliments on them. Everyone always thinks my husband surprised me with tulips (my favorite flower) and are shocked to learn these are not real. I have several of them throughout my house, and plan to buy more because they are great!"" —Abbey S. Get them from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in many colors and in sets of 20, 28, or 60). 5...."

Голливудская актриса Шарлиз Терон выступила с неожиданным комментарием в адрес свадьбы Джеффа Безоса и Лорен Санчес, которая на днях прошла в Венеции и стала одним из самых обсуждаемых светских событий этого лета. Выступая на благотворительном вечере Block Party, организованном в поддержку собственного фонда, Терон раскритиковала торжество, на которое были приглашены Ким Кардашьян, Орландо Блум, Иванка Трамп, Леонардо Ди Каприо и другие звезды. Обращаясь к зрителям, она пошутила, что присутствующие в зале – единственные, кого не пригласили на свадьбу. Эта фраза вызвала бурную реакцию зала, но Шарлиз на этом не остановилась. С иронией в голосе она добавила, что не расстроена по этому поводу. ""Ну и ладно. Потому что они отстой, а мы классные. Спасибо вам за то, что вы здесь. Особенно сейчас, когда мир буквально горит"", – отметила актриса. Свадьба Безоса и Санчес, по информации западных СМИ, обошлась основателю Amazon в сумму около 50 миллионов долларов (почти 4 миллиарда рублей. – Прим. ред.). Роскошное торжество с яхтами, ужинами под звездами и легендарными гостями стало главным инфоповодом недели. Однако заявление Терон дало этой истории новый поворот – с долей критики и явного недовольства по поводу чрезмерной пышности мероприятия на фоне мировых кризисов. Комментаторы уже разделились на два лагеря: одни поддерживают звезду, отмечая ее честность и смелость, другие считают высказывание слишком резким. Ранее сообщалось, что Dior представил первую коллекцию высокого ювелирного искусства совместно с Шарлиз Терон."

Credit: DANIEL DAL ZENNARO/EPA Sydney Sweeney and Orlando Bloom were spotted enjoying a sunlit stroll through Venice on Saturday, fresh off the back of Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez's lavish multimillion-dollar wedding celebration. The star-studded duo were part of a who's who guest list at the Friday night ceremony on San Giorgio Maggiore island, which featured performances by Ellie Goulding and Matteo Bocelli and reportedly cost upwards of $20 million, according to News.com.au. Following the late-night celebrations — which news outlets report continued until 3am at the opulent Gritti Palace — Sweeney, Bloom, and NFL star Tom Brady were seen exploring the scenic streets of Venice.

By continuing you agree to our Terms and Privacy Policy. Sweeney, clad in a floral dress and red heels, looked polished yet relaxed, while Bloom wore a casual black ensemble. Brady kept it sporty in a grey training top and shorts. The sighting comes after Sweeney and Brady sparked light romance rumours earlier in the week when they were seen chatting at a bar. Sweeney stunned at the wedding in a dazzling pink gown, while her casual morning look on Saturday showed she can pull off both glamour and off-duty charm with ease. Meanwhile, Bloom made headlines earlier in the week when he was photographed in a water taxi with stylist Jamie Mizrahi — a former fashion consultant to both Meghan Markle and Katy Perry, just days after reports surfaced that Bloom and Perry had called off their engagement. He was later seen sipping cocktails poolside during a 'boys' day' with Brady and Leonardo DiCaprio, while Perry continued touring Australia. Elsewhere, Kardashian sisters Kim and Khloe made a swift post-wedding exit, spotted departing Venice in laid-back outfits while Kendall and Kylie reportedly stayed behind for Saturday night's continuation of festivities at the historic Arsenale di Venezia. The opulent Friday wedding — two years after Bezos proposed aboard his US$500 million yacht — featured a strict no-phone policy and around 200 guests, including 70 family members. The only glimpse inside came via Sánchez's official Instagram account. Opera singer Matteo Bocelli opened the reception with a rendition of Elvis Presley's I Can't Help Falling in Love With You, while a gospel choir moved guests to tears during the vows with a cover of Whitney Houston's Higher Love. Earlier that day, Sánchez made a stylish entrance in a white Dior puff-sleeve suit with oversized sunglasses and a show-stopping new diamond ring. Though Friday marked the official ceremony, Bezos and Sánchez had already legally tied the knot in the United States. The newlyweds were seen on Saturday morning flashing their wedding bands over breakfast at the iconic Harry's Bar. With Venice still buzzing from the celebrations, and A-listers lingering in the city, the wedding of the year isn't over just yet. FacebookLinkedInEmail UsCopy the Link Copy Link Copied"

I'd like to thank everyone who challenged, supported and inspired me throughout this journey - mentors, professors, teammates, and friends. This academic year was transformative. From the quality of teaching to the exposure to industry leaders, I've greatly learnt from this journey - and above all, gained the strategic clarity and cross-disciplinary grounding that helped me carve out a clearer intellectual and professional roadmap. Highlights include: • Learning directly from guest speakers such as the CFOs of Kering and Shiseido and a McKinsey & Company partner who taught one of our core modules. • Collaborating with leading firms including Amazon, Capgemini, Parfums Christian Dior, McKinsey & Company and L'Oréal - a rare opportunity to apply theory to real-world challenges alongside mentors from the industry. • Leading a 5-month Business Project with five HEC teammates, helping a consulting firm develop an AI-powered market sizing tool. • Writing my thesis on price transparency in airline revenue management and exploring its impact on consumer trust and competitiveness in the age of AI. I had the chance to interview senior executives across major European carriers, which made the experience all the more rewarding. Each course, project, and conversation shaped my direction to help me define the next steps - pointing me toward the intersection of data, technology, and strategy. I'm now excited to take this focus further by joining Accenture as a Data Engineering Consulting Intern in the AI & Tech department for the next six months. Looking forward to this new chapter."

Гаджет может решить проблемы стагнации часов Apple и привлечь новых пользователей Журналист Bloomberg Марк Гурман в рассылке «Power On» отметил, что Apple Watch теряет актуальность и уже не демонстрирует заметных технологических рывков. В качестве ответа на эту стагнацию Apple может выпустить умное кольцо — Apple Ring. Такой форм-фактор, по словам Гурмана, выгодно отличается удобством постоянного ношения и не требует ежедневной зарядки. Компактное кольцо подходит к любому стилю одежды, включая деловые костюмы и вечерние наряды, и способно заинтересовать тех, кто не хочет отказываться от традиционных механических часов. Ожидается, что гаджет будет предлагать базовое отслеживание здоровья и активности, оставаясь при этом почти незаметным. Несмотря на потенциальный интерес рынка, официальных подтверждений о старте производства нет. Apple опасается, что кольцо может конкурировать с Apple Watch и снижать его продажи. При этом ряд патентов и утечек подтверждают, что компания держит проект в своей стратегической дорожной карте. Изнанка Идея умного кольца отражает тренд на минимализм и стремление к интеграции технологий в повседневную жизнь без заметного визуального присутствия. При этом Apple продолжает укреплять имидж компании, способной предугадывать желания аудитории.

Η Λόρεν Σάντσεζ και ο Τζεφ Μπέζος παντρεύτηκαν στην Ιταλία αυτό το Σαββατοκύριακο, με καλεσμένους κορυφαία ονόματα, όπως η οικογένεια Καρντάσιαν-Τζένερ, η Ιβάνκα Τραμπ και ο Τζάρεντ Κούσνερ, η Όπρα Γουίνφρεϊ, ο Τομ Μπρέιντι, ο Λεονάρντο Ντι Κάπριο και πολλοί άλλοι. Και από τη στιγμή που η νύφη έφτασε στην Ιταλία μαζί με τον ιδρυτή της Amazon, μας χάρισε ένα εντυπωσιακό ντεφιλέ υψηλής ραπτικής. Από την Τετάρτη που έφτασαν, η Σάντσεζ έχει παρουσιάσει μια σειρά από ανατρεπτικά νυφικά σύνολα, από ένα πολύχρωμο φόρεμα Schiaparelli μέχρι το ειδικά φτιαγμένο Dolce & Gabbana νυφικό της. Ας δούμε όλα όσα έχει φορέσει η Σάντσεζ για τον γάμο της μέχρι στιγμής: Alaïa Το ζευγάρι έφτασε με ελικόπτερο την Τετάρτη, με τον Μπέζος να φορά μπλε πόλο και λευκό παντελόνι. Η Σάντσεζ, από την άλλη, εμφανίστηκε με στυλ παλιάς χολιγουντιανής αίγλης, φορώντας μαύρο φόρεμα Alaïa με ψηλό λαιμό, στραπ πέδιλα, τεράστια διαμαντένια σκουλαρίκια και υπερμεγέθη γυαλιά ηλίου. Vintage Alexander McQueen, Το βράδυ απόλαυσαν ένα ρομαντικό δείπνο, με τη μέλλουσα νύφη να επιλέγει vintage δημιουργία του Alexander McQueen, από μετάξι με λοξή ραφή και διακοσμητικά κουμπιά, από τη συλλογή άνοιξη 2003. Ο Μπέζος φορούσε μαύρο κοστούμι, κρεμ T-shirt και γυαλιά ηλίου. Schiaparelli Haute Couture Έτοιμη πλέον να γιορτάσει με τους καλεσμένους της, η Σάντσεζ επέλεξε ένα εκθαμβωτικό κορσέ φόρεμα για να ανοίξει τις γαμήλιες εκδηλώσεις την Πέμπτη. Το Schiaparelli Haute Couture φόρεμα, με περίτεχνα κεντήματα λουλουδιών και γλυπτική, στράπλες σιλουέτα, ήταν αξιοπρεπές για τη νύφη ενός πολυδισεκατομμυριούχου. Dior Το πρωί της Παρασκευής, η Σάντσεζ βγήκε από το ξενοδοχείο με ένα κομψό, θηλυκό σύνολο Dior, που περιλάμβανε σακάκι-πουκάμισο με ζώνη στη μέση και αντίστοιχη φούστα. Συμπλήρωσε το look με μεταξωτό φουλάρι Hermès δεμένο τύπου Sophia Loren γύρω από το λαιμό, και μαύρα γυαλιά ηλίου Tom Ford. Τα αξεσουάρ της νύφης τράβηξαν τα βλέμματα: φορούσε δύο τεράστια διαμαντένια δαχτυλίδια, συμπεριλαμβανομένου του ροζ μονόπετρου αρραβώνα, καθώς και ένα νέο εντυπωσιακό διαμάντι της Lorraine Schwartz. Επιπλέον, ένα βραχιόλι με τα νέα της αρχικά “LB” από διαμάντια κοσμούσε τον καρπό της. Dolce & Gabbana (νυφικό) Όταν ήρθε η ώρα να περπατήσει προς τον Μπέζος στην τελετή, η νέα κυρία Μπέζος εμπνεύστηκε από το νυφικό της Σοφία Λόρεν στην ταινία Houseboat, φορώντας ειδικά ραμμένο Dolce & Gabbana νυφικό με μακριά μανίκια. Όπως δήλωσε στη Vogue, ήθελε να εκπλήξει τον σύζυγό της και τους καλεσμένους με κάτι πιο συντηρητικό, επιλέγοντας τελικά ένα δαντελένιο φόρεμα με ζιβάγκο, ενσωματωμένο κορσέ και γραμμή γοργόνας. Το φόρεμα ολοκληρωνόταν με κουμπιά που κατέβαιναν από τον λαιμό μέχρι το φινίρισμα. Casual chic Η Σάντσες και ο Μπέζος επισκέφθηκαν το εμβληματικό Harry's Bar στη Βενετία το Σάββατο, στην πρώτη τους εμφάνιση ως νεόνυμφοι. Αν και το μαύρο φόρεμα και το καπέλο ηλίου της Σάντσες ήταν πιο ανεπίσημα σε σύγκριση με τις προηγούμενες νυφικές εμφανίσεις της, ανέβασε το σύνολο με επώνυμα γυαλιά ηλίου και ένα τσαντάκι Hermès Kelly. Versace γεμάτο κρύσταλλα Το Σάββατο, η πρώην δημοσιογράφος, 55 ετών, φόρεσε ένα στράπλες φόρεμα από ζορζέτα του Atelier Versace γεμάτο κρύσταλλα για το πάρτι «Dolce Notte», που μεταφράζεται ως «Γλυκιά Νύχτα». Φτιαγμένο από μεταξωτό σιφόν, είχε χειροποίητο κέντημα στον κορσέ με κρυστάλλους Swarovski σε ροζ χρυσό, μπρονζέ και χρυσό. Τα καστανά μαλλιά της Σάντσες ήταν χτενισμένα κάτω σε χαλαρούς κυματισμούς, ενώ συνδύασε την εμφάνιση με διαμαντένια σκουλαρίκια. Διαβάστε ακόμη: Σήμερα γάμος ...έγινε!

The three-part project, ""Landscapes of the Mind,"" includes a book, a 27-minute instrumental vinyl record and custom high fidelity sound system. The multimedia debut at Beck Cultural Exchange Center in Knoxville was featured in Essence and W magazines. Model Binx Walton has been all around the world walking the runways for Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, Prada, Gucci, Tom Ford and countless other high fashion designers. She has appeared on the covers of British Vogue, Italian Vogue, French Elle and Dazed magazine. But it was Knoxville where she had to debut her most personal project to date. Walton, who spent much of her adolescence in Knoxville, premiered her multimedia project “Landscapes of the Mind” at Beck Cultural Exchange Center for a one-night-only affair on June 12. “Landscapes” is an ""immersive, introspective experience that blends sound, written word and sculptural design to explore emotional landscapes, memory and personal transformation,” according to the artist. A real conversation between lovers “Landscapes of the Mind” is a three-part multimedia project featuring a written book, vinyl recording and a custom sound system to create an authentic listening experience. At its core, the story is about the evolution of love and personal growth. Need a break?

She was then inspired to put the words to music while listening to the record “Harvest Time” (1977) by saxophonist Pharoah Sanders. Walton created the project using the name Lee Walton. She shared with Knox News what inspired her to step outside of the world of fashion to experiment with writing and music, and why it was important for her to share it with Knoxville first. She collaborated with a former lover who created the 27-minute instrumental portion “Landscapes of the Mind.” “Everything happened organically. That doesn't mean without a tremendous amount of work, but there was a conscious following of some intangible energy that led one aspect of the project to the next,” Walton said of the creative process. She described the project as “a real conversation between lovers, which I really grew to love - although at times, it feels insufferable to experience.” Knoxville shaped an international model Walton was last in Knoxville several years ago, when her grandfather died. Debuting “Landscapes of the Mind” in her hometown was unexpected, but necessary. “I left (Knoxville) thinking there wasn't much for me here anymore — but through this project, I found I was a long way from the truth. Knoxville is such a big part of who I am. It shaped my perception of a lot of the world, good and bad,” Walton said. “I've always kept the reality of my life in Knoxville separate from New York, but this gave me an opportunity to integrate them,” she continued. She also wanted to share the sound of the high-fidelity stereo system she had custom built for the project with Knoxville. The specific technology used in the system is often only experienced in professional recording studios. “It's a real gate-kept art form,” Walton said. “I wanted to create a moment in Knoxville where the people of this community got a chance to be with equipment they otherwise wouldn't have access to — to just sit and listen, and present intimacy in an important way, in an inner-city community that, from my personal experience, isn't confronted with that kind of space often. “It was an honor, and it set an incredible standard for how I want to release my work going forward."" The event also featured a live discussion and Q&A with Lee and Yusuf Hassan of Black Mass Publishing, which published Lee's book. The sweetest agony of life Walton set out to examine how love, in all its forms, transforms us. Here's what she learned about the universally experienced emotion: “I learned it's one of the sweetest agonies in life. I learned my desire has intangible depths. I learned I can be honest about what I want - but also accept the things I cannot expect out of one human. I learned that a mask is a terrible thing to unknowingly hide behind.” The “Landscapes of the Mind” debut at Beck was featured in Essence and W magazines. Walton told W that the Knoxville showcase gave her the confidence to present the project in other areas, including in her current home state, New York. Walton has written a second book she plans to publish, too, according to W. Devarrick Turner is a trending news reporter. Email devarrick.turner@knoxnews.com.

Specifications: Brand: Hermes Weight: 75 ml Volume: 2.5 Fluid Ounces Scent: Scented 05 How to Make Luxury Perfume Last Longer? To make your luxury perfume last longer, start by applying it to clean, moisturised skin. Hydrated skin acts as a better canvas, holding the scent for extended periods. Next, keep the focus on pulse points like wrists, neck, behind ears, and inner elbows, where body heat helps diffuse the fragrance throughout the day. And the most important, avoid rubbing your wrists together after application, as this can break down the delicate scent molecules. Consider layering your fragrance by using matching scented body products like lotions or shower gels. You can also lightly spritz perfume onto your hairbrush and comb it through your hair, as hair strands can retain scent well. Finally, proper storage is crucial: keep your perfumes in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and humidity, which can degrade the fragrance over time. Choosing an Eau de Parfum (EDP) over an Eau de Toilette (EDT) or Cologne will also provide better longevity due to its higher fragrance oil concentration...."

I was not surprised as since I started to attend fashion week, back in 2019, venues have inverted, blended or blurred gender collections, which broadens the scope of the designs on display. Sportsmax launching party     I was really honoured to attend the event of the high-end Italian brand. I was greeted by a flashy yellow bracelet, some gin tonic and music by a woman DJ. The collections on display were very interesting: showcasing the relationship between fashion and art, sculptural bags particularly got my attention. Black and white neutrals flirted with des vﾃｪtements bijoux, blue tinted Dior sunglasses, 2.0 Louboutin shoes. Watch me try out the star item of the collection:          Splash Trade Show     As some of you read in my previous articles, Splash is a swimming suit and accessories trade show. The items on display are mainly designed for women which is pretty funny since its men's Paris Fashion Week. I spoke with several brands from all over the world: Brazil, Australia, London. It felt I was on my way to a Coachella festival: colourful prints, cowboy hats and last but not least, creative stickers. I met the designer of the brand Barriﾃｨre, Alexa and she explained to me that she fostered aesthetic wellness stickers in order to respond to the needs of our bodies while staying in style. Vitamin D boost? Skin repair? The brand's got you covered. Just pick your favourite pattern among constellations, fruits, hearts filled with love. Patch your favourite sticker and you're good to go."

INDEX SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025 SECTION 2 OTHER NEWS: 2025 SECTION 1 PRESS RELEASES: 2025 June 13: CyCraft Technology Co Ltd: Jony Ive Partners With OpenAI To Redefine AI Hardware A Vision for the Future of Computing The partnership, which builds on two years of quiet collaboration between OpenAI and Ive's firm LoveFrom, seeks to reimagine what computers can be. ""I think we have the opportunity here to completely re-imagine what it means to use a computer,"" Altman said in a video statement. Ive echoed this sentiment, noting the world is on the ""brink of a new generation of technology."" A New Family of Devices The collaboration has already produced a prototype that Altman called ""the coolest piece of technology the world will have ever seen."" Ive added that the first device they've been working on has ""completely captured our imagination."" While specifics remain under wraps, posts on X indicate mass production is slated for 2027, with assembly planned outside China, possibly in Vietnam, to mitigate geopolitical risks. This move comes as competitors like Humane AI and Rabbit have struggled with AI hardware, facing issues like poor battery life and limited functionality. Implications For The Tech Industry Ive's departure from Apple in 2019, after 27 years of shaping its design legacy, marked a turning point for the tech giant. Apple's shares dropped over 2% following the announcement, reflecting market concerns about OpenAI's potential to challenge the iPhone's dominance. OpenAI, which sparked an AI investment wave with ChatGPT in 2022, is now expanding into hardware, a space where tech giants like Meta, Google, and Apple are also innovating with AI-driven headsets and glasses. However, past failures like Humane AI's troubled AI Pin raise questions about whether Ive and Altman can deliver on their ambitious vision.

ВІДЕО ДНЯ Один з кадрів привернув особливу увагу її підписників — на ньому можна добре розглянути обручку журналістки, пише Page Six. Точніше, продемонструвала Лорен на знімку відразу дві каблучки. Заручну, більш круглої форми, 20 каратів і вартістю приблизно 2,5 млн доларів, вона перемістила на праву руку. А ось на ліву одягла нову обручку: овальної форми, створену відомим ювеліром Лоррейном Шварцом. Видання з посиланням на експерта в ювелірному мистецтві пише, що вага цієї каблучки становить приблизно 45 каратів, а вартість може сягати 6 млн доларів. Втім, інші фахівці оцінюють коштовність лише у 4 млн доларів. РЕКЛАМА Також на фотографіях Лорен у вбранні Dior найуважніші помітили браслет з новими ініціалами журналістки, LB (Лорен Безос). РЕКЛАМА Загалом, як пишуть ЗМІ, за три дні весільних урочистостей Лорен одягла прикраси загальною вартістю 20—30 млн доларів. «Цікаво, що до появи такої яскравої жінки Безос жив цілком у дусі всіх найбагатших людей планети: браслети типу Woop або Apple Watch, жодних гучних вечірок і широких жестів. Але Лорен переконала його, що жити треба красиво — носити найдорожчі каблучки світу, скликати на весілля ще й за все весілля, платити мільярди?»  — пише видання. Примітно, що сама Лорен Санчес назвала своє весілля, загальний бюджет якого становить близько 55 млн доларів, «інтимною» урочистістю. Адже серед 200 гостей 70 — це родичі. Про це Лорен заявила у розмові з Vogue, який опублікував її офіційні фото у весільних образах. Раніше Лорен вже демонструвала свою прихильність до розкошів. Нагадаємо, Безос посідає третє місце у світі за величиною своїх статків. Станом на 1 квітня активи засновника Amazon оцінювалися у 215 мільярдів доларів.

Τον Μάιο του 2023, ο ιδρυτής της Amazon έκανε πρόταση γάμου στην πρώην τηλεοπτική παρουσιάστρια με ένα διαμαντένιο δαχτυλίδι κοπής cushion, τοποθετημένο σε πλατινένια βάση. Ο Bezos έκανε την πρόταση μετά από τέσσερα χρόνια σχέσης, κατά τη διάρκεια διακοπών στη Νότια Γαλλία. Ύστερα από δύο χρόνια αρραβώνα, η Sánchez και ο Bezos παντρεύτηκαν με μία μοναδική τελετή. Λίγο μετά την πρόταση, μια πηγή ανέφερε στο PEOPLE πως η Sánchez ήταν ""στον έβδομο ουρανό"" για τον αρραβώνα της με τον Bezos. «Κανείς δεν την έχει δει ποτέ τόσο ευτυχισμένη», δήλωσε η πηγή. «Πετάει στα σύννεφα. Ο Jeff είναι ο πρίγκιπάς της». Μιλώντας στη Vogue τον Νοέμβριο του 2023, η Sánchez αποκάλυψε πως παρότι δεν είχαν καταλήξει ακόμη σε οριστικά σχέδια για τον γάμο, είχε αποφασίσει «κατά 100%» πως θα πάρει το επώνυμο του Bezos. Όσο για το τι σημαίνει να γίνει σύζυγος ενός δισεκατομμυριούχου, δήλωσε πως είναι έτοιμη για την ευθύνη: «Πιστεύω ότι υπάρχουν πολλές ευκαιρίες που συνοδεύουν αυτόν τον ρόλο και τις αντιμετωπίζω με μεγάλη σοβαρότητα», είπε. «Πάντα κοιταζόμαστε και λέμε: “Είμαστε ομάδα”. Οπότε τα πάντα είναι κοινά». Το δαχτυλίδι αρραβώνα της Lauren Sánchez Το δαχτυλίδι αρραβώνα της Sánchez είναι πραγματικά εντυπωσιακό. Το τεράστιο κόσμημα διαθέτει διαμάντι κοπής cushion — υπολογίζεται να είναι περίπου 30 καράτια — στερεωμένο σε πλατινένια βάση με τέσσερα δόντια. Αν και στην αρχή φαινόταν να πρόκειται για λευκό διαμάντι, η ίδια επιβεβαίωσε στη Vogue πως το δικό της διαμάντι έχει ροζ απόχρωση, κάτι σπάνιο και μοναδικό.

Η κοσμηματοπώλης και ειδικός Briony Raymond είπε στο PEOPLE πως, λόγω της υψηλής καθαρότητας και χρώματος του διαμαντιού, η τιμή του υπολογίζεται από 3 έως και 5 εκατομμύρια δολάρια, ανάλογα με τα ακριβή χαρακτηριστικά του λίθου. Ο Bezos έκανε την πρόταση τον Μάιο του 2023, κατά τη διάρκεια διακοπών στη Νότια Γαλλία. Η Sánchez φωτογραφήθηκε να φορά το νέο της δαχτυλίδι ενώ περνούσε χρόνο με τον αρραβωνιαστικό της στο γιωτ αξίας 500 εκατομμυρίων δολαρίων του Bezos, που ονομάζεται Koru. Μιλώντας στη Vogue, η Sánchez αποκάλυψε πως πριν την πρόταση είχαν δειπνήσει υπό τα αστέρια και, όταν ξάπλωσε, ανακάλυψε ότι ο Bezos είχε κρύψει το δαχτυλίδι κάτω από το μαξιλάρι της. «Όταν άνοιξε το κουτί, νομίζω ότι έπαθα ένα μικρό σοκ», ανέφερε χαρακτηριστικά.

The Spring/Summer 2026 menswear show revealed an impressive blend of garments and styles, reflecting a deep understanding of the Dior legacy. Anderson sought not to replicate the 'New Look 'but to adopt a perspective reminiscent of Christian Dior, merging historical influences with contemporary relevance. Acknowledging that the original 'New Look 'drew inspiration from the past, he crafted a collection steeped in rich references, showcasing a love for construction and the opulence of the 18th century. With influences from acclaimed couturiers like Cristobal Balenciaga, Anderson embraced the idea that true innovation is often rooted in history. Saint Laurent Spring/Summer 2026: A Sensory Art Installation for a Sound Bath With Summer Sophistication. Christian Dior's decade of creativity has left an indelible mark on fashion. Anderson's vision, articulated from the Dior studios, emphasizes personal style—a departure from the rigid dictatorial approach of the past, where the 'New Look 'once rendered previous fashions obsolete. Anderson reveals his contemporary take on style by mixing unexpected elements—Regency tailcoats with jeans, military motifs on shirts, and the grandeur of Dior evening gowns reimagined for men. He infused his identity into the collection with Irish tweed Bar jackets and meticulously recreated 18th-century garments, addressing the underrepresentation of menswear history. Louis Vuitton Men's Spring-Summer 2026 – Indian Sartorialism, Positioned Within the Magnified Game Board by Architect Bijoy Jain, Explores Tactile Dandyism. Dior's Debut: Jonathan Anderson Makes History and Redefines It His designs resonate with reality, steering clear from fantastical flights that have characterized past creative directors. Instead, Anderson's character-driven approach connects to the essence of couture, offering a fresh perspective for his forthcoming ventures in that realm. He acknowledges the importance of historical references while adapting them for modern relevance, exemplified by subtle design elements in contemporary pieces. A distinct Frenchness suffused the collection, characterized by models resembling refined 16th arrondissement schoolboys, and embodied by Parisian soccer captain Kylian Mbappé. The presentation intertwined literature and fashion, with bags featuring first edition covers and an engaging pre-show soundtrack. The blend of garments, inspirations, and approaches demonstrated profound sophistication and a deep appreciation for Dior. Anderson posed a thought-provoking question about capturing the essence of it all: “It's curating it. And celebrating it.” His desire to enjoy the creative process shines through, inspiring a new era for Dior. (The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Jun 30, 2025 05:54 PM IST.

mov_7DFDFD8035F6BA8459687DC170FE42CF,2025-06-30 12:28:44,en,WEB,"  Yes, we're still thinking about Jonathan Anderson's first show for Dior Men. With colors and silhouette experimentation, a self-ironic flair and stylistic intellectualism, the designer announced his entrance into the French maison in grand style, earning the approval of the entire industry. But while all eyes were on that collection, the rest of the Paris Fashion Week carried on. Between political shows (thank you, Willy Chevarria) and museum inaugurations (merci, Rick Owens and Demna), the French menswear fashion calendar didn't disappoint the expectations of a demanding audience coming from a creatively lacking Milan. Many brands and designers managed to embody the style of 2025 on the runway this summer, but unfortunately, our column calls for a rather narrow selection. So here are the 5 shows from Paris Fashion Week Men's SS26 you missed and should definitely catch up on. Dries Van Noten Anxiety and fear of failure didn't stop Dries Van Noten's new creative director, Julian Klusner, from delivering a majestic collection. His first solo outing after years of working alongside the maison's founder, and his first menswear collection, a crucial milestone for a brand that began with menswear back in 1986. What stood out in this collection was how Klausner didn't try to mimic the imagination, prints, and masterful color selection of Van Noten. Perhaps because he grew up in the Belgian designer's ateliers, Klausner's touch hinted at - but didn't replicate - his predecessor's designs. Explosive color combinations, color-blocking, and graphic flourishes were still present, but with a less romantic, more sporty feel than Dries Van Noten fans might expect. Hermès When you need the perfect summer capsule, just leave it to Véronique Nichanian. The designer, artistic director of Hermès menswear since 1988, said with a big smile after the show that the collection was designed for «just a nice, cool guy in the city. » With a muted yet clearly luxurious color palette and a carefully studied play on proportions (oversized jacket–tight trousers and vice versa), Nichanian really illustrated what a chic, wealthy, but down-to-earth guy would wear around town. Cream-colored bombers, glossy brown leather jackets, crumpled linen suits, and silk and satin tops made the collection sensual, with the addition of playful fringed scarves around the neck. The bags - which were many - were all oversized and packed with innovative stylistic details, adding practicality to the refined but relaxed looks. After all, he's just a chill guy. KidSuper Right now, fashion is all about practicality, functional garments, and tangible results (money, revenue, recovery). But even in the darkest moments, we need a little escape. In Paris, there's Colm Dillane, who brought a good dose of fantasy and escapism to the runway with KidSuper SS26, along with the soccer stars so beloved by the American designer (hi, Mario Balotelli). For this collection, Dillane wrote and published The Boy Who Jumped the Moon, a children's book telling his own story, childhood dreams, and how he made them come true. But what truly left a mark in this show wasn't the space-themed inspiration of the garments, it was their delightful humor. It's a rich collection in every sense: full of prints, embroidery, textures, and surprising details, like a necktie made of pencils or a belt inspired by The Little Prince. What's even better is that, aside from the primary-colored geometric tops and book-shaped bags, everything looks incredibly wearable, even the yellow astronaut jumpsuit. Craig Green If we talk about gorpcore today, it's thanks in part to Craig Green, who blends sportswear and tailoring, grace and practicality with exceptional skill. A year after his last show (then presented in London), the British designer brought a collection to the runway that was extremely springlike, nostalgic in its inspiration - the Beatles and the 1960s - but not in execution. With LED-lit eyes, handkerchiefs clenched between teeth, and other vague references to the psychedelic effects of LSD, Green presented concept-driven garments that still feel of their time. All conventional items - parkas, knits, t-shirts, polos, and technical jackets - were stripped of their conventionality. Every element in the collection had something odd, ambiguous, just as if seen through someone's altered perception. Floral prints and vibrant colors really evoked the '60s, but the use of technical fabrics, layering, and the reinterpretation of classics like the polo (a staple of menswear and the brand's DNA) made SS26 a snapshot of now, of today, and of our need to romanticize even the most ordinary days. Wales Bonner In 2025, you can't talk about menswear without mentioning Grace Wales Bonner, the British designer who has managed to formalize sneakers without compromising them, all while centering Black culture in contemporary fashion. Wales Bonner's SS26 drew inspiration from garments of the past - those inherited from grandparents and great-grandparents - elevated and reinterpreted through the hands of a skilled tailor. Details of a tuxedo were woven into everyday pieces, from jeans to workwear suits, and each of the more dramatic garments was toned down with sporty pairings, like striped tracksuits, fleece jackets, technical shorts, or baggy jeans (a distinctly British move that calls to mind the golden years of Glastonbury). Special mention goes to the footwear, which once again risked stealing the spotlight from an equally brilliant collection: suede snoafer, leather fringes, shiny ballerina flats, and slim sneakers in collaboration with Y3 added all the color missing from the black-and-white looks, with bold mix-and-match palettes and reflective dark leather that brought charm to even the most solemn outfits."

Set in the Orangerie, once a nurturing home to the palace's fruit trees, this venue symbolizes the beauty of simplicity meeting refinement. Fashion that connects to our human emotions often carries with it stories that touch the heart, and European designers, known for their emotional craftsmanship, excel at this. As Simone Porte Jacquemus unveiled his Spring-Summer 2026 menswear collection, there was an overwhelming warmth intertwined with nostalgia. “Le Paysan” was nothing short of breathtaking, showcasing exquisite tailoring and designs that deeply moved us. Every detail—the craftsmanship, the storytelling, the visual experience—was meticulously curated, encapsulating the essence of who he is. Get Ready for a '20s Hair Revival: Finger Waves & Kiss Curls Are Back! In this collection, Jacquemus elegantly revisits early silhouettes with newfound precision, creating a personal narrative that beautifully illustrates how beauty can originate in humble fields and eventually grace the opulence of Versailles. The voluminous poplin skirts, corseted jackets, linens reminiscent of vintage tablecloths, and sun-faded Provençal menswear all echoed with a sense of comfort and familiarity. The color palette was gentle and nostalgic, featuring soft creams, blacks, and pastels that evoke sweet memories. Dior's Plot Twist Under Jonathan Anderson. Craftsmanship took center stage, highlighted by intricate details such as 700 meters of bobbin tulle, shimmering silk taffeta diamonds, and delicately sculpted leather tassels. Accessories added a playful yet heartfelt touch, with lovingly crafted grosgrain-wrapped espadrilles, charming rosemary bags, and whimsical jewelry shaped like vegetables and sweets. Through this collection, Jacquemus invites us to reflect on our own roots, celebrating the emotional connections that make us who we are. Jacquemus SS26 (Photo Credits: File Image) Another remarkable story comes from the talented Italian designer Alessandra Facchinetti, who poured her heart into a fashion collection inspired by a poignant letter to her father, Andrea Buccellati, during his challenging battle with illness. This touching collection, named ""Romanza,"" was unveiled in 2013, reflecting the deep love and concern she felt for her father. Facchinetti, known for her work with prestigious brands like Gucci and Valentino, used ""Romanza"" as a heartfelt tribute, weaving her emotions into every detail of the designs. The collection served as a powerful medium for Facchinetti to connect with her father, allowing her to express her feelings in a deeply personal way through her artistry. Young designers, like Simon, also embody this spirit of inspiration and emotion in their work. The show resonated profoundly, leaving many in tears and feeling a genuine connection, even from behind a laptop screen. The essence of the brand and its heartfelt message shone through in a way that was simply perfect—flawless in its presentation. These creations allow us to relate to the garments personally by telling childhood stories that linger in the corners of our hearts, creating a tapestry of shared experiences and emotions. What a truly heartwarming way to wrap up the season this week. It's moments like these that remind us of the love and togetherness that bring us joy above all the work, fashion and play… (The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Jun 30, 2025 06:02 PM IST.

Chavarria made a powerful statement during his Paris Fashion Week show, honoring the nearly three hundred men deported to CECOT prison in El Salvador by the American presidency without due process. Recognized as one of the most influential Latino designers in fashion, Chavarria's collection paid tribute to Chicano culture while uplifting marginalized communities. Hailing from the agricultural town of Huron, California, the 58-year-old queer Mexican-American designer draws inspiration from the immigrants he encountered during his youth. His journey, from sketching in Dollar Store notebooks to collaborating with renowned brands like Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein, and Adidas, sets the stage for what's ahead. Through his label, launched in 2015, he strives to elevate Chicano culture and fashion while creating space for authenticity and future Latinx designers. Chavarria's designs included collaborations with artists such as Kendrick Lamar and Becky G. As he prepared to unveil this thought-provoking collection, anticipation grew regarding how he would continue to represent his community through his designs, casting, music, and chosen venues.

It's about taking what's been overlooked or misunderstood and showcasing its beauty.” Dior's Plot Twist Under Jonathan Anderson. Chavarria challenged the status quo with one of the most impactful presentations at Paris Fashion Week. He aims to create space for marginalized communities in high fashion while using this platform to highlight the social injustices they experience daily. The SS2026 Collection in Paris was expected to kick off with a powerful performance aimed at drawing attention to the illegal detention and deportation of immigrants in the U.S. by ICE—U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. With models wearing oversized outfits reminiscent of the CECOT uniform, the show was anticipated to evoke strong imagery, as they formed a line on their knees and sat in a circle with their hands behind their backs. These formations powerfully mirrored the scenes captured in images released from CECOT prison by President Bukele of El Salvador, who controversially used prisoners as props. As the U.S. government continues to endorse the prison system in El Salvador—described by Chavarria as a place where ""no one ever gets out""—the show sparked vital discussions about justice and representation in the fashion industry. His socially conscious designs, blending men's and women's wear, emphasize Latinx heritage and social justice. (The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Jun 30, 2025 06:09 PM IST.

mov_9C621FE1D07A0A42987A80C43B1B33FC,2025-06-30 12:50:34,en,WEB,"  Men's fashion took bold steps forward this season, with Summer 2026 collections in Paris and Milan combining together heritage, innovation, and a fresh sense of fluidity. Designers played with contrasts - between structure and ease, concealment and revelation, past and future - to define a new paradigm of masculine elegance. Yves Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello: Tribute to desire and light Presented at the Bourse de Commerce in Paris, Anthony Vaccarello's Summer 2026 menswear collection for Yves Saint Laurent felt like a poetic moment suspended between worlds - Paris and Fire Island, reality and memory. The show was framed by clinamen, an installation by Céleste Boursier-Mougenot featuring drifting porcelain bowls on water, creating invisible connections and resonances - a perfect metaphor for the collection's themes. Vaccarello's designs paid homage to a lost generation of artists and to Yves Saint Laurent himself, who in 1974 withdrew from the public eye to create anew. The silhouettes floated lightly, shaped with cinched waists and extended shoulders, crafted in silk and nylon that traced the body with ease. The muted palette - sand, salt, pale ochre, dry moss, and pool blue - reflected a daylight clarity, rejecting artificial theatricality for a sensuality that felt intimate and held. Shorts echoed those once worn by a young Yves, a subtle nod without explicit reference. This collection wasn't an homage in the traditional sense, but a continuation - an elegy to desire as style, and elegance as ambiguity. Dior by Jonathan Anderson: Rewriting tradition with joy Jonathan Anderson's first Dior menswear show at the Hôtel National des Invalides in Paris revisited the House's rich sartorial history through a joyful lens. The collection merged formality with playfulness, presenting Bar jackets in tweed adorned with tuxedo details, alongside archival couture shapes reimagined as cargo shorts. The embroidery of 18th and 19th-century French motifs blossomed on sweaters and sneakers, blending high culture with streetwise sensibility. Sharp frockcoats met relaxed denim, creating a compelling tension between structure and ease. Set against velvet-lined walls inspired by Berlin's Gemäldegalerie - adorned with 18th-century still lifes loaned by the Louvre and National Galleries of Scotland - the show embodied a refined spontaneity. Here, empathy redefined elegance, inviting men to dress with both history and heart. Prada: A shift in tone, a new movement Milan hosted Prada's Spring/Summer 2026 menswear show at the Deposito in Fondazione Prada, where elemental inspirations ruled: land, air, sun, and nature formed the collection's beating heart. Prada dismantled traditional meanings and power structures with nonconformist harmonies and an impulse toward freedom. The collection evoked imaginary places - the lover's lake, peak's end, and last swim - crafting a mood both elemental and emotional. The clothes moved with ease, reflecting a liberated spirit ready to embrace new beginnings. Brunello Cucinelli: The shape of light Brunello Cucinelli's vision of summer menswear played on contrasts between fluidity and structure, color and calm. His 'Shape of Light' narrative introduced a man who wears elegance effortlessly - balancing refined tailoring with relaxed silhouettes. The color story featured vibrant oranges, apricots, royal blues, and coral reds alongside whites and soft neutrals. Silhouettes blended soft trousers with slightly lengthened blazers, knitwear with light textures, and outerwear crafted from pure silk and supple leather. Footwear followed suit, with deconstructed loafers and sneakers designed for comfort and sophistication. This collection captured a modern masculinity defined not by rigidity, but by grace, lightness, and a celebration of spontaneity. Hermès by Véronique Nichanian: Craftsmanship and effortless summer At Paris Fashion Week, Hermès' long-serving menswear artistic director Véronique Nichanian presented a collection that balanced lightness and tradition with impeccable craftsmanship. Woven leather trousers paired with airy sleeveless tops and striped overshirts captured a summer spirit defined by ease and sophistication. The warm color palette of browns and beiges was complemented by roomy canvas bags with leather straps, while rope sandals and silk bandanas added subtle finishing touches. The collection spoke quietly yet confidently to the enduring allure of Hermès, a brand that continues to outpace its rivals by staying true to its legacy while embracing modernity. Louis Vuitton by Pharrell Williams: Cultural fusion and playful adventure Louis Vuitton's presentation at the Centre Pompidou was a vibrant exploration of cultural intersections, guided by Pharrell Williams' creative vision. The runway unfolded like a giant Snakes and Ladders game, blending Indian influences with mountain expedition aesthetics. Layered looks combined functional outerwear with bold prints, while accessories reinforced the adventurous spirit. The collection was a celebration of movement and multicultural storytelling, underpinned by an infectious musical score that energized the show from start to finish. Amiri: Los Angeles edge meets Italian craft Over in Milan, Amiri's Summer 2026 collection channeled its signature Los Angeles attitude through meticulously crafted Italian tailoring. The brand balanced streetwear cool with luxury detailing, showcasing distressed denim, leather jackets, and embroidered shirts that spoke to a raw yet refined masculinity. Bold textures and layered silhouettes created dynamic contrasts, while rich tones grounded the collection in warmth and intensity. Amiri's offering was a nod to the globalized nature of modern menswear - where cultural influences merge effortlessly to create something distinctly contemporary. Across these houses, Summer 2026 men's fashion is less about loud declarations and more about subtle dialogues - between eras, moods, and cities. It's an invitation to dress with intention, embracing vulnerability as strength, and tradition as a living, breathing narrative."

""ليل ميكيلا"" ولديها 2.5 مليون متابع, تعتبر الرائدة في مجال الإنفلونسرز الافتراضيين، وتمكنت من الجمع بين مظهر واقعي، محتوى سردي جذاب، وشراكات تجارية وموسيقية ضخمة, هي مثال حي لمحاكاة شخصيات الذكاء الاصطناعي للإنسان والتفوق عليه في بعض جوانب التسويق الرقمي. ابتكرتها شركة ""Brud"" في لوس أنجلوس, مغنية وعارضة ظهرت في حملات Dior، Prada، وغنت مع J Balvin"""", وضعت ضمن قائمة أكثر 25 شخصية تأثيرا. ""ليا لوف"" استطاعت جذب أكثر من546 ألف متابع, هي مناصرة للبيئة من سويسرا, ألفت كتابا عن البيئة وشاركت في قمة الشباب للأمم المتحدة, لذلك تعتبر مثال نادر لمؤثرة رقمية ذات رسالة بيئية قوية. ""أيتانا لوبيز"" وتتمتع ب 338 ألف متابع, هي أول عارضة أزياء افتراضية في إسبانيا, صممت لتكون بديلا أكثر التزاما وانضباطا من العارضات الحقيقيات. كما بدأت المنطقة العربية تلتحق بالركب, فظهر عدد من المؤثرات الافتراضيات منهن, ""جود"" من الإمارات, فتاة افتراضية عمرها 24 عاما، تهتم بالموضة والتصوير. و""مياسين"" أول شخصية خليجية افتراضية تظهر في حملات إعلانية رقمية. ومن النماذج الصاعدة، شخصية ""رهف"" على تيك توك، هي مؤثرة افتراضية مصرية جديدة تقدم محتوى اجتماعي ساخر وتسويقي بذكاء لافت، وصلت متابعتها إلى حوالي 7 آلاف متابع، وبلغ إجمالي الإعجاب نحو 35 ألفا، مما يعني أنها في مراحل النمو المبكر, تنشر مقاطع فيديو تروج فيها لنفسها كخيار مثالي للشركات. وللتعرف أكثر على هذا العالم لابد أولا من معرفة هوية المؤثر الافتراضي, فهو شخصية رقمية بالكامل، لا وجود لها في الواقع بل صنعت باستخدام تقنيات الذكاء الاصطناعي المتقدمة وأدوات التصميم ثلاثي الأبعاد مثل Midjourney وStable Diffusion, ويتم إنشاؤهم بناء على ""أوامر نصية"" وعبر توليد صور واقعية انطلاقا من نصوص يكتبها المصمم ""prompt-based design""، ثم تبرمج لشخصية افتراضية كاملة, هذه الشخصيات قد تكون شبيهة بالبشر إلى حد كبير أو أقرب لشخصيات الأنمي والرموز التعبيرية ""أفاتار"". وتمر صناعة المؤثرين الافتراضيين بسلسلة من الخطوات التقنية والإبداعية التي تعتمد على أحدث تقنيات الذكاء الاصطناعي والتصميم الرقمي, تبدأ بتصميم الشكل والمظهر, ثم تحريك الشخصية، ويتم الاستعانة ببرامج مثل Blender أو Unreal Engine لتحريك الشخصية، مع استخدام الذكاء الاصطناعي لمزامنة حركات الوجه والصوت مع الفيديو. الخطوة التالية هي بناء الهوية والسرد, وفيها يتم تصميم خلفية واقعية ومقنعة للشخصية من حيث العمر، الشخصية، الهوايات، أسلوب الحياة, هذه السمات تستخدم في المحتوى لتقوية الارتباط مع الجمهور. بعد الإطلاق على إنستغرام أو تيك توك، يتم جدولة المحتوى والردود، وأحيانا تدار بالكامل عبر روبوتات مدعومة بالذكاء الاصطناعي. بالنسبة للصوت واللغة, فيستخدم الذكاء الاصطناعي لتوليد صوت بشري مخصص، يمكن برمجته بلهجات مختلفة ولغات متعددة ليتناسب مع الجمهور المستهدف. أما الذكاء العاطفي, فبعض المؤثرين الافتراضيين مزودون بأنظمة تتفاعل عاطفيا، مما يجعلهم يردون بنبرة ودية أو حزينة أو ساخرة حسب السياق. ومع تطور أدوات مثل ChatGPT وSora وMidjourney، أصبح من الممكن لأي شركة، أو حتى شخص واحد، إنشاء شخصية مؤثرة رقمية خلال أيام. يشكل المؤثرين الافتراضيين عامل جذب مهم خاصة للشركات والعلامات التجارية الكبرى, وذلك لعدة أسباب أهمها, التحكم التام بالمحتوى والمظهر والسلوك, غياب الفضائح أو النزاعات القانونية, سهولة تخصيصهم ليتماشى ذلك مع صورة العلامة التجارية, وأيضا تكلفة أقل على المدى الطويل. وقد أظهرت الدراسات أن نحو 48.7% من المسوقين باتوا يدمجون الذكاء الاصطناعي في استراتيجياتهم الترويجية بشكل مباشر. وبالرغم من علم المتابعين أن هؤلاء الإنفلونسرز غير حقيقيين، فإنهم يتابعونهم بشغف لأسباب عديدة أهمها، الجاذبية البصرية لما يتميزون به من تصميم مثالي لا يتأثر بالزمن, كذلك التحكم في السلوك, لا فضائح، لا مواقف سياسية مثيرة للجدل, أيضا الخيال والواقع, فهم يربطون بين الخيال الرقمي والقصص الواقعية بطريقة تسحر المتلقي. وقد نجحوا في تحقيق أرباحا مثل المؤثرين الحقيقيين بل وأحيانا أكثر, على سبيل المثال، ""ليل ميكيلا"" حققت أكثر من 10 ملايين دولار في السنة من الإعلانات والرعاية, وقد بدأت شركات عملاقة في الاستثمار في هذه الشخصيات لتقليل تكاليف الإنتاج والتقليل من مخاطر التعامل مع مؤثرين حقيقيين. وبالرغم من هذا النجاح لا يمكن اعتبارهم بديلا كاملا، لكنهم أصبحوا منافسا قويا, فالمؤثر الافتراضي لا يتعب، لا يمرض ولا يتعرض لفضائح, لكنه يفتقر لتجربة الحياة الحقيقية. فنحن أمام حقبة جديدة يعاد فيها تعريف مفهوم ""المؤثر"", والواقع الرقمي بات مليئا بشخصيات افتراضية تتفوق أحيانا على البشر في التأثير، التنظيم، والانضباط, إنها ثورة صامتة يقودها الذكاء الاصطناعي, وتغير مستقبل الإعلام والإعلان, فالمؤثرون الافتراضيون ليسوا مجرد صور أو رسوم، بل كيانات رقمية متكاملة تمتلك صوتا، شخصية، وجمهورا, وربما السؤال لم يعد ""هل سينجحون؟"", بل ""من سيكون التالي؟"". اقرأ أيضا: باستخدام Veo 3.. الذكاء الاصطناعي يصنع الأفلام بلغة البشر"

Теперь эта эпоха уходит в прошлое так же стремительно, как тренд на широкие брови! Современные технологии ворвались в индустрию красоты, и теперь искусственный интеллект может определить состояние вашей кожи точнее, чем ваша любимая подруга-косметолог. 🤖 Компания Perfect Corp (настоящий технологический гигант в мире красоты) разработала умную систему, которая анализирует вашу кожу по селфи. И нет, это не очередной Instagram-фильтр! Это серьёзная технология, основанная на глубоком обучении, которая оценивает всё: от морщинок до темных кругов под глазами, которые вы так старательно маскируете консилером. Такие бренды, как Dior и Estée Lauder, уже вовсю используют эту технологию. А что самое интересное – наши любимые марки тоже не отстают. Clarins, Caudalie, Avène и другие уже встроили эти умные системы в свои сайты. Представляете, сидите вы дома в пижаме, делаете селфи, а искусственный интеллект составляет вам персональную программу ухода! 📱 И это работает! Например, у швейцарского люксового бренда Maison Valmont после внедрения этой технологии продажи выросли в три раза. Видимо, клиенты оценили, когда им не впаривают очередной «чудо-крем», а действительно подбирают то, что нужно именно их коже. Но технологии не стоят на месте. Perfect Corp недавно представила новую фишку – анализ лица в 3D, с охватом 180 градусов. Теперь искусственный интеллект видит вас в профиль не хуже, чем ваш парикмахер! Это позволяет получить еще более точные рекомендации и отслеживать результаты использования косметики в динамике. А самое забавное – теперь у брендов появились чат-боты, настоящие виртуальные консультанты. Например, у Clarins есть бот по имени Clara (очень мило, правда?). Она анализирует ваше селфи и даёт рекомендации 24/7. Никаких «зайдите попозже» или «я на обеде» – искусственный интеллект всегда на связи! 💬 Вся эта технологическая революция происходит прямо у нас в смартфонах. Не нужно никакого специального оборудования – достаточно обычного телефона или планшета. И обновления происходят постоянно, делая системы всё умнее и точнее. Что же в итоге? Похоже, будущее уже наступило, и оно выглядит довольно заманчиво! Теперь можно получить профессиональную консультацию по уходу за кожей, не выходя из дома. Хотя, признаюсь честно, иногда так не хватает живого общения с консультантом, который может похвалить твой выбор или по секрету рассказать о новинках… Мой совет? Не бойтесь пробовать новые технологии, но и не забывайте о здравом смысле. Artificial Intelligence – это здорово, но никто не отменял Natural Intelligence! Используйте умные системы как помощников, а не как единственный источник истины. И помните: даже самый продвинутый искусственный интеллект не заменит вашей интуиции и знания собственной кожи. 🌟 0"

mov_FB1D7ECEBFF88D659FEA70A13ED68A49,2025-06-30 15:00:56,en,WEB,"  Perfume is meant to be worn year-round. But in heat of summer, it's a good idea to lighten up with everything and that includes fragrance. That might explain why hair and body mists, a lighter alternative to perfume, are exploding right now. “I find hair and body mists to be super versatile, they're fresh, light and easy to use,” says Chriselle Lim, Co-Owner and Creative Director of PHLUR. “They're the perfect way to add fragrance to your day without feeling too heavy or formal, and they're great for layering. There's also something playful and approachable about them. It's a little luxury that feels accessible, and I think that really resonates with people right now and reflects a broader shift towards embracing elevation and self-expression in our beauty routines.” No stranger to the trend, PHLUR has expanded their presence in the category. “Launching body mists felt like a natural next step for PHLUR as we're always thinking about ways to make fragrance more approachable and expanding the ways you can bring fragrance into different parts of your day,” Lim says. “With body mists, we wanted to give people more ways to express themselves through fragrance. Body mists are a lighter, more effortless way to enjoy scent, while still delivering the quality and complexity our customers expect from PHLUR. I personally love layering our body mists with our eau de parfums. I use the eau de parfum as a base on my pulse points and then apply the mist to my hair and clothes for a subtle, fresh layer. My favorite combo right now is PHLUR Beach Skin Hair & Body Mist and Missing Person Eau de Parfum.” So what exactly makes hair and body mists unique from perfumes? “The main difference is in the fragrance concentration,” Lim says. “Body mists are meant to be more subtle and light, and so carry a lower concentration of fragrance oil than eau de parfums. With our PHLUR Body Mists though, we actually formulate with a much higher fragrance load than is typical for body mists—it was important for us that our body mists have a stronger projection and last longer, so customers still get that bold, unexpected PHLUR scent experience.” Start spritzing with these top new hair and body mists. Phlur Peach Skin Hair & Body Fragrance Mist Imagine sipping a fresh, juicy mimosa al fresco while basking in the sun and you have this soft, sweet (but not too sweet), velvety scent. “We hadn't formulated a fruity gourmand in over a year, and I was craving a scent that captured a summer feeling but with a juicy, fruity twist,” Lim says. “I love that Peach Skin isn't a straightforward peach—it is fresh, juicy, velvety, like biting into a ripe peach, but it is layered with beautiful florals and a woody, creamy base that elevates the fragrance. I love to take a twist on nostalgic fragrances, and I feel like it's hard to get a peach scent that doesn't feel too juvenile. We worked tirelessly on Peach Skin and am so proud of what we created. It's sophisticated, yet flirty and entirely addictive.” Notes of peach are rounded out with plum, amber, bergamot, jasmine, vanilla orchid, milky sandalwood and coconut caramel. $38, phlur.com Josie Maran Bohemian Fig Fragrance Mist When clean beauty queen Josie Maran relaunched her brand last year to be more eco-friendly, she did so with new fragrances inspired by growing up in California. Now all four scents are available in fragrance mist format, made with 100% natural ingredients and designed to be super hydrating with argan oil and jojoba. Bohemian Fig feels like a night out in a tropical town with fig, vetiver and vanilla orchid. Layer them with her body products or wear them solo. $26, sephora.com Dior Miss Dior Blooming Bouquet Hair Mist When you really want to give your scent staying power, apply both a perfume and a mist.

But the truth is, when it comes to manicures and pedicures, you can throw the rule book out of the window. Especially in summer, when anything goes! Summer is, after all, a time for adventure, even if it's just having fun with new colours and nail designs. We're talking bright and vibrant shades like mustard yellow, bright reds, neon orange and light-refracting chrome. For minimalists, creamy neutrals and classic pinks will still make your nails pop. Or, simply keep going with your winter favourites if you're particularly attached to the deep and dark shades. Here are the 12 summer nail colours the professionals predict big things for this summer. 1. Tomato red Are we gearing up for another tomato girl summer? According to celebrity nail artist and founder of the eponymous nail polish brand, Jin Soon Choi, we might be. “I adore the hot orange-red shade with a translucent finish,” Choi says. “It's vibrant and lively, capturing the essence of summer like nothing else.” To capture the true essence of tomato, look for a red with an orange tint to it – this is what immediately brings to mind the punchy ripeness of a fresh summer tomato. Chanel Le Vernis Nail Colour Incendiare Hermès Les Mains Hermès Nail Enamel 39 Orange Poppy 2. Lilac jelly Korean jelly nails were big this spring, and manicurist Julie Kandalec is predicting that the appetite will continue all through the summer season. While any colour goes well with the translucent, juicy look of these nails, she suggests something like a pretty pastel lilac (à la Hailey Bieber at Coachella) for your summer nail look. The best way to get jelly nails at home is to use Korean gel polish, like the GAOY Jelly Gel Nail Polish Kit. But you can use a top coat to help get you that translucent effect, like the O.P.I. Gel Plump Effect Volumizing Top Coat – simply mix it with your main base colour. O.P.I. Gel Plump Effect Top Coat Nails Inc. Jel Oh Jel Jelly Effect Nail Polish 3. Coffee club For mani minimalists, neutral nails are your North star. Chanel nail artist Betina Goldstein loves the Chanel Le Vernis Longwear Nail Colour Particulière, a latte brown that, thanks to its rich creamy colour, will go with any look. If you want something a bit deeper with warm undertones, we like Palette London Toasted Taupe Nail Paint. For something deeper and more mocha-coded, try Nails Inc. Caught in The Nude Nail Polish in shade Hawaii Beach. Nails Inc. Caught in The Nude Nail Polish Hawaii Beach Palette Toasted Taupe Nail Paint 4. Off-white You can't go too far wrong with classic white. “[White nails are] perfect to rock from winter to summer, as they go with everything and still feel so minimal, yet fresh,” says celebrity nail artist Queenie Nguyen. She recommends trying an off-white shade for something a bit more unexpected. Essie Nail Polish 8 Limo Scene 5. Pistachio green Bright and cheerful, pistachio green is the perfect colour to get you in the mood for all of your warm weather adventures. “[It's] a really fun shade that's a bit unexpected yet fresh,” Kandalec says.

With the iconic Palace of Versailles as their backdrop, the longtime couple stepped out in sleek, monochromatic ensembles that both featured two key elements: tailored trousers and a structured blazer, albeit rendered in very different silhouettes.

Safe to say girl world is healing. The ""Manchild"" songstress (who famously dated Olivia's ex, Joshua Bassett) wasn't just at the concert. She traveled all the way from Paris to catch the set and was having herself a good ole time bopping to hits like, ahem, ""Drivers License."" IYKYK. She didn't just nail the whole ~girls supporting girls~ thing, either. She also nailed the 'fit. Sabrina swapped her afternoon look (head-to-toe Dior look for Jonathan Anderson's debut Homme Menswear show) for a sheer Guizio babydoll dress, black leather boots, and the Loewe Puzzle Edge bag. Guizio Aviva Dress While the Guizio dress is tragically sold out online (moment of silence, pls), Revolve is already prepping its restock (light! At the end of the tunnel!!) . In fact, you can preorder the style RN in the most Sabrina-coded baby blue shade and it'll ship out in just a few weeks. And let me tell you, it's worth the brief wait. The lightweight poplin fabric is ideal for summer—hello, less material = less sweat. It's simple math—while the breezy babydoll silhouette is similarly cool, literally and figuratively. The style is partially lined for some but not too much coverage, and features the most intricate embroidered lace detailing that gives ""once in a lifetime thrift store treasure."" So, you want to recreate our girl's entire look?? Easy peasy. Snag a pair of short-shorts for underneath (the brand's Maelle style would be my first pick) and a black leather boot (my vote's on these Amazon ones). Finish off the 'fit with Quince's Italian leather patchwork crossbody, which looks soooo much like the $3,850 Loewe version slung across Sabrina's shoulder. Shop the rest of Sabrina's look! Maybe take a cue from our fave pop princesses and befriend your ex's ex while you're at it. The Sabrina-Olivia tale should be a lesson—he was always the problem."

mov_01A3E164C865AA954363048C4E3192CD,2025-06-30 19:11:32,en,WEB,"  It's a tale of one city and two weddings with a decade in between and an even wider gulf in terms of style and dignity. As Venice recovers from the trashy takeover of the $20 million Bezos/Sanchez nuptials, complete with its anti-capitalist protests, freak storms and ubiquitous Kardashian cleavage, I remember when the Floating City hosted an altogether classier A-lister's big day. Back in 2014, George and Amal Clooney set the Dolce Vita blueprint for Italian high society at the chic seven-star Aman Grand Canal Hotel with a masterclass in leading man and lady classic romance befitting of the ancient City of Love. With a comparatively modest $4.6 million budget, the couple, who met in Italy a year earlier, married in front of just 60 guests. Then the crowd, which featured a smattering of VIPs including Anna Wintour and Cindy Crawford, was impeccably, rather than half, dressed – unlike Kim, Khloe, Kylie and Kendall who were among the many 'stars' to let it all hang out at the Bezos' celebrations. George smouldered in a custom-made cashmere Armani suit, while Lebanese British Human Rights lawyer, Amal, was elegance personified in a demure, lace Oscar de la Renta wedding gown. In short, the photogenic Clooneys were ready for their close-up without appearing to be especially desperate for it, which can't be said for rictus grin poseurs, Jeff and Lauren. Yes, the 61-year-old Amazon founder and 55-year-old occasional astronaut may have stayed at the same hotel and even used the same London-based event planners, Lanza & Baucina, as the A-list couple but the results could not have been more different. Because this wedding's overall vibe, across three days of celebration, was more reality TV than old Hollywood. Even in a classic tux and sporting a buff rebuild, Jeff looked more like a conference-bound salesman than a tech titan. Let's face it, the tone was set when the 'lovebirds' (combined age 111) kicked off proceedings with a foam party on the deck of their $500 million yacht. The pair seem to have a gift for making eyewatering expenditure look spectacularly cheap. Why settle for merely taking over a hotel when you can rent an entire island? (San Giorgio Maggiore in this case for the actual ceremony). Why miss the chance to upgrade your $3 million, 30 carat, pink diamond engagement ring to an egg-sized 35 carat, diamond rock? Both of which resemble gauche costume pieces, when set next to Amal's classic and ethically mined $500,000, seven carat, dazzler. And while Amal wowed in three iconic looks - a cream silk, navy trim, Stella McCartney pantsuit for the civil ceremony at Ca' Farsetti Palace, an ivory Oscar de la Renta gown for the wedding and a silver one for the reception – Sanchez opted for an exhaustive whirl of costume changes. 'Highlights' included an eye-wateringly tight – and, at $100,000, expensive - Schiaparelli corset dress which she wore to the welcome dinner Thursday night, looking for all the world like a server at Medieval Times. Then came full blown dress-up, as she donned an Hermes headscarf and cream Dior suit the following day. If this was intended to be an homage to Italian icon Sophia Loren, it fell flat, looking more like parody than a true echo of the star's effortless chic. In fact, Sanchez's actual bridal gown – high-necked and made from hand-appliquéd Italian lace – marked a rare moment of understated restraint. Of course, the real way to ram your 0.0001 per cent credentials down everyone's throats is with heavy-handed security. From eye-sore scaffolding and street closures to monopolising water taxis, it was hard pecorino to the great unwashed trying to go about their business in Venice last week. It's pretty clear why many Venetians were riled, rather than charmed, by this love story. The Clooneys' comparatively modest celebrations caused barely a ripple in the city's waterways. Meanwhile, sick of the roar of all those private jets overhead, climate change protesters picketed Bezos and Sanchez's tone-deaf display of excess. Not that the new Mr and Mrs Bezos are entirely oblivious to their hefty carbon footprint. In place of presents, they informed their guests, donations had been made on their behalf to UNESCO's (United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Office) Venice office in support of sustainability. Well, that covers that then. Well done to wedding planners Lanza & Baucina for managing to keep a straight face when they spoke of their client's wish to minimize any 'disruption to the city.' They also pointed to the sensitivity of the couple's use of local suppliers including Rosa Salva, the oldest pastry shop in Venice, whose efforts were surely wasted on the corset-clad, Ozempic-hungry guests. But, if any did allow a cream puff to pass their inflated lips, let's hope it left a better taste in their mouths than this tawdry matrimonial marathon has left in all of ours."
mov_E9C96AF6F75258FD29EC597DCDFC5730,2025-06-30 19:15:00,en,WEB,"  Labubu dolls are stealing the spotlight in 2025. From blind box secrets to celeb-loved bag charms, these quirky collectibles are must-haves! Key Takeaways Labubu dolls blend fashion, art, and myster, —making them top collectibles in 2025. Blind boxes, rare editions, and celeb trends fuel their rising value and demand. Buy from trusted sellers to avoid fakes and get authentic pieces. A strange little figure has taken over the fashion world. Labubu dolls, with their sharp teeth and playful faces, are now the center of a global craze. These dolls aren't just toys—they are style statements, collectibles, and cultural icons. Created by Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung, Labubu comes from “The Monsters” series. Pop Mart produces these wildly popular figures. Each doll combines quirk, charm, and chaos in a way that speaks to collectors, fashion lovers, and fans of all things unique. Seasoned collectors and newcomers chase seasonal themes, rare secret figures, vinyl charms, and even oversized installations. Prices range from affordable to auction‑level, offering a spectrum of choices for every budget. Why Labubu Dolls Have Become a Global Obsession Labubu stands out in a sea of plush toys. The doll's elfin face, wide eyes, and impish smile mix innocence with mischief. Influenced by Nordic myth, its design feels magical and timeless. Pop Mart uses a blind box model to sell most of these dolls. That means the buyer doesn't know which version comes inside. This mystery has only increased their demand. Some dolls appear in secret editions—so rare, there's just a 1-in-72 chance to find one. Celebrities have fueled the trend. Blackpink's Lisa, Kim Kardashian, Rihanna, and Dua Lipa have all been seen with Labubu dolls dangling from their high-end bags. The dolls now appear as charms on Hermès, Dior, and Louis Vuitton purses. These tiny monsters have become luxury-level accessories. Why Labubu Dolls Reign in 2025 Labubu belongs to Pop Mart's “The Monsters” lineup, inspired by Nordic myth and bizarre charm. Blind boxes fuel both surprise and scarcity. One rare life‑size PVC Labubu fetched $170,000 in Beijing. Pop Mart's blind‑box model fueled $1.8 billion in revenue in 2024, cementing Labubu's global craze. Also Read: Mini Marvels: These Bizarre Gadgets Actually Exist Top Labubu Picks to Buy Online Seasonal & Limited Editions Popular series like Angel in Clouds, Have a Seat, Coca‑Cola, and Exciting Macaron launched late 2024 to early 2025.

Their allure lies in surprise and exclusivity. Vinyl Plush Bag Charms Budget‑friendly and stylish, these hang from handbags or backpacks for ~$20–30. Celebrity use confirms their statement‑piece status. Life‑Size Figurines Oversized PVC models like the four‑foot mint Labubu dominate auction rooms, from $80,000 up to $170,000. They're rare but iconic. Where to Buy Authentic Labubu? Pop Mart's official site and stores offer the freshest blind boxes and announce restocks globally.

AI influencers, also known as virtual influencers, are quickly becoming one of the most talked-about trends in the influencer marketing world. These digital personalities, often powered by AI and CGI, can look and behave like real people. Some are animated or stylized, while others are nearly indistinguishable from humans. While AI influencers won't replace human creators, they are changing the game, offering new opportunities for creative campaigns, brand storytelling, and customer interaction. Understanding how to work with these digital personas is key for marketers who want to stay ahead of the curve. In this article, CreatorDB explores the evolution of AI influencers, why they're gaining popularity, how leading brands are using them, and what this trend means for the future of influencer marketing. What Are AI Influencers? AI influencers are digital personas created using AI tools and CGI. They behave like human influencers, posting content, engaging with followers, and partnering with brands, but they are not real people. Some are managed by agencies, while others are entirely autonomous with AI-generated visuals and personalities. According to The Conversation, there are three main types of AI influencers: – Characters that are clearly fictional (e.g., mascots). – Stylized or cartoon-like personas. – Nearly indistinguishable from real people. Some of the most well-known examples include: LilMiquela – Fashion and music influencer with over 2.7 million followers. Imma – A Japanese virtual model with a highly engaged following. Kuki – An interactive chatbot with a social media presence. A Brief History of Virtual Influencers The concept of AI influencers first came out in the early 2010s. Back then, the early versions of AI influencers were simply virtual characters in the gaming and entertainment industry. As AI and computer graphics developed, these characters started to have more nuances and became more sophisticated, eventually becoming the virtual influencers we see today. In 2016, the world welcomed Lil Miquela, who is considered the first official hyperrealistic AI influencer in history. After her release, there were a ton of debates about whether she was a real person or not. Since then, the virtual influencer industry has exploded: CB from Casa Bahia – A Brazilian virtual mascot with over 10M followers. Milla Sofia – An AI-generated influencer using diffusion models. – From Lu of Magalu to Noonoouri, companies are building and managing their own digital ambassadors. Why Are Brands Turning to AI Influencers? Though still niche, AI influencers appeal to brands for several compelling reasons: Total control over content, messaging, and brand representation No scandals or PR risks, unlike human influencers Always available for campaigns and engagement Cost-effective over time High novelty value, boosting brand buzz and attention Besides those reasons, according to Influencer Marketing Hub data, AI influencers are collecting excellent feedback from the marketers who worked with them and inspiring more collaborations: of marketing professionals have worked with AI influencers plan to collaborate with AI influencers Over of those who once collaborated with virtual influencers are satisfied. Since AI influencers don't exist as people outside of their social media feeds, a team of professionals manages them, making it easier to align them with the specifics of a marketing campaign. Infographic showing attributes of AI influencers vs human influencers. (Stacker/Stacker) CreatorDB Case Studies: How Brands Are Using AI Influencers Although there is still no data about how effective AI influencers are compared to traditional influencers, it is clear that the fit with the product is still the most critical factor for a successful influencer marketing campaign. Audiences might be happy to see the innovation of AI influencers, but they may find human influencers more relatable regarding certain products. Still, AI influencers are great if brands want to showcase an innovative image and position themselves at the forefront of a trend. CreatorDB found three case studies in different industries to help you better understand how to work with AI influencers. 1...."

While AI influencers won't replace human creators, they are changing the game, offering new opportunities for creative campaigns, brand storytelling, and customer interaction. Understanding how to work with these digital personas is key for marketers who want to stay ahead of the curve. In this article, CreatorDB explores the evolution of AI influencers, why they're gaining popularity, how leading brands are using them, and what this trend means for the future of influencer marketing. What Are AI Influencers? AI influencers are digital personas created using AI tools and CGI. They behave like human influencers, posting content, engaging with followers, and partnering with brands, but they are not real people. Some are managed by agencies, while others are entirely autonomous with AI-generated visuals and personalities. According to The Conversation, there are three main types of AI influencers: Non-Humans – Characters that are clearly fictional (e.g., mascots). Animated Humans – Stylized or cartoon-like personas. Hyper-Realistic CGI Humans – Nearly indistinguishable from real people. Some of the most well-known examples include: LilMiquela – Fashion and music influencer with over 2.7 million followers. Imma – A Japanese virtual model with a highly engaged following. Kuki – An interactive chatbot with a social media presence. A Brief History of Virtual Influencers The concept of AI influencers first came out in the early 2010s. Back then, the early versions of AI influencers were simply virtual characters in the gaming and entertainment industry. As AI and computer graphics developed, these characters started to have more nuances and became more sophisticated, eventually becoming the virtual influencers we see today. In 2016, the world welcomed Lil Miquela, who is considered the first official hyperrealistic AI influencer in history. After her release, there were a ton of debates about whether she was a real person or not. Since then, the virtual influencer industry has exploded: CB from Casa Bahia – A Brazilian virtual mascot with over 10M followers. Milla Sofia – An AI-generated influencer using diffusion models. Brand-created influencers – From Lu of Magalu to Noonoouri, companies are building and managing their own digital ambassadors. Why Are Brands Turning to AI Influencers? Though still niche, AI influencers appeal to brands for several compelling reasons: Total control over content, messaging, and brand representation No scandals or PR risks, unlike human influencers Always available for campaigns and engagement Cost-effective over time High novelty value, boosting brand buzz and attention Besides those reasons, according to Influencer Marketing Hub data, AI influencers are collecting excellent feedback from the marketers who worked with them and inspiring more collaborations: 59.8% of marketing professionals have worked with AI influencers 15.5% plan to collaborate with AI influencers Over 60% of those who once collaborated with virtual influencers are satisfied. Since AI influencers don't exist as people outside of their social media feeds, a team of professionals manages them, making it easier to align them with the specifics of a marketing campaign.

ec14a6341917c7618e11acb432b0beaa,2025-06-30 20:24:00,en,WEB,"  Natalie Portman was seen out in New York in an effortless black T-Shirt, cut-off jean shorts and sneakers Cut-off jean shorts are the perfect base for all your laid-back summer outfits and are loved by celebrities like Em Rata and J.Lo . You can shop similar throwback versions of Portman's shorts from brands like Levis , Agolde , and Boden . Walking to and from the subway has become the thing I dread most in the morning. As soon as I roll out of bed, I stare into the void that has become my closet and think to myself, ""What can I wear that won't make me look like a wet rag once I get to my final destination?"" The answer, more times than not, is, of course, shorts . A preppy pleated pair is fine to wear to the office, but sometimes I just want to relish in the laid-back vibes of summer and throw on a pair of good ol' cut-offs. Apparently, Natalie Portman also feels the same about her off-duty attire. Portman in her off duty outfit. Getty Images On June 29, the actor took a break from her usual jaw-dropping red-carpet gowns and was spotted on an afternoon jaunt in NYC wearing the easiest of outfits. While Portman's weekend look consisted of just a black tee and cutoff jean shorts , the accessories she wore with them added a bit of jazz to the outfit. Her black Hokas sneaker lent a sporty, Tomboyish vibe to her look, while pieces from Dior, including a beige shoulder bag with pom-pom adornments, and honey-brown tortoiseshell sunglasses elevated the ensemble. Levi's 501 Original Fit High Rise Shorts Levis $69 at Levi.com Agolde Parker Long Short Agolde $148 at Agolde.com While I sit here at my desk typing this very story in my stuffy slacks, I can't help but yearn for the charming casualness of Portman's denim shorts. There's something incredibly liberating about sauntering out on the sidewalk in nothing but a T-shirt and shorts, and truth be told, Portman has me nearly convinced that I should take a pair of scissors to all my jeans this season. Because let's face it, nothing says laid-back like a pair of cut-offs. Listen, I know what you're thinking: Are cutoff shorts too laid back? Not if you style them like Portman's and keep your accessories high-end. You can swap out a tee for something dressier, like a boho blouse or an oversized button-down. Paired with sneakers, mules, or loafers, this look says to the world, ""I got dressed up without looking like I spent an ungodly amount of time."" If you want to style your denim a bit sultry, then go the Em Rata and J.Lo route and pair them with a fitted scoop-neck tank top. If cutting up your old denim is out of the question, then shop ahead for the cutoff styles that'll do just the trick.

Titled Moncler x Gilga Farm, the collection reinterprets Moncler's alpine heritage through a Californian lens, blending the brand's mountain wear DNA with Glover's focus on functionality, comfort and everyday usefulness. The collection includes quilted jackets, technical linen canvas, wool-cashmere knits, lightweight ripstop windbreakers and a standout burnt orange suede jacket. Other key pieces include oversized workwear-inspired layers, shorts, cotton tees and a convertible duvet jacket that transforms into a sleeping bag — a reference to Moncler's original sleeping bag product. The pieces are designed to be wearable in transitional weather, balancing practicality with relaxed style. Colorways are inspired by the Ojai Valley landscape and Gilga Farm's surroundings, featuring washed pinks, creams, oranges and pale blues. Natural-feel fabrics are used throughout and orange fiber — a nod to Gilga's citrus groves — is woven into select garments. The orange also appears as a recurring motif in logos and design accents. Footwear includes a simplified version of the Moncler Trailgrip Vela sandal, made from cotton ribbon and leather and finished with a pale pink Vibram sole. The collaboration also introduces playful design elements, including patches, comic strip graphics and a reimagined version of Moncler's Monduck mascot, shown as a farmer character across the collection. Animated care labels — voiced by Glover — reference the Monduck tag found in his first Moncler jacket, blending personal storytelling with brand heritage. “Functionality is key — it's something that connects the world of Gilga and Moncler,” Glover said of the collaboration. “We both create for real-world usefulness.” The campaign features a short animated film in which a cartoon version of Glover falls asleep at Gilga Farm and dreams of a Moncler alpine landscape, illustrating the merging of both worlds. Moncler x Gilga Farm is available now at select Moncler locations and online at moncler.com. A new book and exhibit explore Christian Dior's floral inspiration A new book titled “Dior Enchanting Gardens” explores the central role that nature, gardens and flowers have played in the creative universe of Christian Dior and the legacy of the house he founded. Published by Rizzoli, the volume traces Dior's lifelong fascination with the natural world, which began in his childhood home, Villa Les Rhumbs in Granville, and extended to other private residences including the Château de La Colle Noire in Montauroux and the Moulin du Coudret in Milly-la-Forêt. These locations and their gardens are presented chapter by chapter, offering insight into how they influenced both Dior's personal life and creative output. Flowers were a key inspiration for Dior from the start — notably in his 1947 New Look collection, which featured the Corolle line, and in the creation of Miss Dior, his first fragrance. The book connects these early inspirations to the work of Dior's artistic successors, including Maria Grazia Chiuri, showing how floral motifs have remained a defining element of the brand's aesthetic through decades of couture and fragrance design. Alongside text contributions, the book features rare archival documents and photographs by leading fashion photographers such as Henry Clarke, Patrick Demarchelier, Brigitte Niedermair and Paolo Roversi. Garments are shown alongside Dior's most iconic fragrances in a visual and historical survey that spans from the original femme-fleur silhouette to contemporary designs. “Dior Enchanting Gardens” includes a preface by Jean-Paul Claverie, an introduction by Brigitte Richart and essays by contributors including Philippe Deliau, Amy de La Haye, Vincent Leret, Barbara Jeauffroy-Mairet and Coline Zellal. The book is a companion to the exhibition of the same name, running at the Musée Christian Dior in Granville, France through Nov. 2. “Synth II” by Kevin Beasley (Source: Regen Projects) Regen Projects presents Kevin Beasley's “What delineates the edge” Artist Kevin Beasley returns to Regen Projects this summer with “What delineates the edge,” his second solo exhibition at the gallery. Known for his sculptural work that fuses found materials with experimental processes, Beasley continues his exploration of memory, materiality and spatial form through a new series of wall-mounted slabs and freestanding sculptures. The exhibition centers on the idea of thresholds — both literal and metaphorical — bringing together personal and cultural references. Using his signature cast resin technique, Beasley incorporates objects such as bedsheets, military uniforms, hats, carbon fiber, denim and shoes into sculptural screens that function like movable partitions. These works act as armatures for meaning, creating porous, layered boundaries that invite viewers to navigate the space through improvisation. Also on view are Beasley's “Synths” — large resin panels embedded with items like raw cotton, chipped pool cues, PPE components and T-shirts. The compositions reference both Beasley's personal history growing up in Virginia and broader cultural narratives, with the materials sometimes clearly visible and other times obscured. The title, drawn from musical synthesizers, reflects the work's aim to translate memory and emotion into visual form. The show follows Beasley's recent large-scale installation at Storm King Art Center and recent exhibitions at the Walker Art Center and the 15th Gwangju Biennale. His work is held in major public collections including the Museum of Modern Art, the Whitney Museum of American Art, the Tate Modern in London and the Art Institute of Chicago. “What delineates the edge” is on view at Regen Projects, 6750 Santa Monica Blvd., Los Angeles, California 90038, from July 2 to Aug. 16. Reformation x StyledSara debut the Sara Linen Dress Reformation, the cult-favorite Los Angeles label known for its effortlessly feminine silhouettes and commitment to sustainability, has launched a new collaboration with stylist and fashion consultant Sara Walker. The Sara Linen Dress is a ladylike midi crafted from 100% linen, complete with scalloped trim and buckle details that channel Walker's deep archive of fashion references. “I designed a piece that feels effortless and flattering, but still packed with personality,” she said. “The scalloped trim was inspired by a 1960s fashion magazine I've kept for years, and the buckle details are a subtle wink to a '90s runway moment I've never forgotten.” The dress will be available in three distinct colorways: Stampede, a chocolate brown zebra print; Nectarine, a coral-and-orange colorblock; and Parmesan, a soft yellow with crisp white accents. To celebrate the launch, Walker hosted an intimate lunch at the Chateau Marmont earlier this month. Guests including Tezza, Angela Fink, Gab Waller and Liv Perez all wore the new design, styled their own way — a fitting tribute to Reformation's blend of timeless appeal and individual expression. This collaboration follows a string of successful partnerships for the brand, which has previously teamed up with fashion and culture tastemakers like Kacey Musgraves, D.. ."

AI influencers, also known as virtual influencers, are quickly becoming one of the most talked-about trends in the influencer marketing world. These digital personalities, often powered by AI and CGI, can look and behave like real people. Some are animated or stylized, while others are nearly indistinguishable from humans. While AI influencers won't replace human creators, they are changing the game, offering new opportunities for creative campaigns, brand storytelling, and customer interaction. Understanding how to work with these digital personas is key for marketers who want to stay ahead of the curve. In this article, CreatorDB explores the evolution of AI influencers, why they're gaining popularity, how leading brands are using them, and what this trend means for the future of influencer marketing. What Are AI Influencers? AI influencers are digital personas created using AI tools and CGI. They behave like human influencers, posting content, engaging with followers, and partnering with brands, but they are not real people. Some are managed by agencies, while others are entirely autonomous with AI-generated visuals and personalities. According to The Conversation, there are three main types of AI influencers: Non-Humans – Characters that are clearly fictional (e.g., mascots). Animated Humans – Stylized or cartoon-like personas. Hyper-Realistic CGI Humans – Nearly indistinguishable from real people. Some of the most well-known examples include: LilMiquela – Fashion and music influencer with over 2.7 million followers. Imma – A Japanese virtual model with a highly engaged following. Kuki – An interactive chatbot with a social media presence. A Brief History of Virtual Influencers The concept of AI influencers first came out in the early 2010s. Back then, the early versions of AI influencers were simply virtual characters in the gaming and entertainment industry. As AI and computer graphics developed, these characters started to have more nuances and became more sophisticated, eventually becoming the virtual influencers we see today. In 2016, the world welcomed Lil Miquela, who is considered the first official hyperrealistic AI influencer in history. After her release, there were a ton of debates about whether she was a real person or not. Since then, the virtual influencer industry has exploded: CB from Casa Bahia – A Brazilian virtual mascot with over 10M followers. Milla Sofia – An AI-generated influencer using diffusion models. Brand-created influencers – From Lu of Magalu to Noonoouri, companies are building and managing their own digital ambassadors. Why Are Brands Turning to AI Influencers? Though still niche, AI influencers appeal to brands for several compelling reasons: Total control over content, messaging, and brand representation No scandals or PR risks, unlike human influencers Always available for campaigns and engagement Cost-effective over time High novelty value, boosting brand buzz and attention Besides those reasons, according to Influencer Marketing Hub data, AI influencers are collecting excellent feedback from the marketers who worked with them and inspiring more collaborations: 59.8% of marketing professionals have worked with AI influencers 15.5% plan to collaborate with AI influencers Over 60% of those who once collaborated with virtual influencers are satisfied. Since AI influencers don't exist as people outside of their social media feeds, a team of professionals manages them, making it easier to align them with the specifics of a marketing campaign. CreatorDB Case Studies: How Brands Are Using AI Influencers Although there is still no data about how effective AI influencers are compared to traditional influencers, it is clear that the fit with the product is still the most critical factor for a successful influencer marketing campaign. Audiences might be happy to see the innovation of AI influencers, but they may find human influencers more relatable regarding certain products. Still, AI influencers are great if brands want to showcase an innovative image and position themselves at the forefront of a trend.

 記得去年跟姜濤訪談，當時我們聊到他為新作品系列的部署，這次再遇上他時正好就是作品陸續推出的時候。 本年已經推出了兩首，分別是〈白果〉及〈On A SunnyDay〉。 〈On A SunnyDay〉是一首生日主題的歌曲，關於概念他解釋說：「很感謝大家，這幾年來都溫暖的跟我慶祝生日！ 相比以前也沒有甚麼朋友跟我慶祝，也沒有舉行過生日會，一般都是跟家人慶祝的，而現在這麼多人一起跟我慶祝，讓我想起也許世界上有其他人會在生日的時候因為沒有人跟他慶祝而感到孤單，希望可以透過這首歌將生日的喜悅跟大家分享。」 粉絲們跟他慶祝非常有心思，本年就在生日會上放煙火，所有看到的人也必然感受到大家對他的愛的熾熱。 說到今年大概還有三至四首歌推出，在他正一步一步地做好每一首歌時，他說起創作上的想法，「今年的歌會有一個概念連貫整年，曲風上會有些不同，但也不是特別去想要甚麼新的嘗試，單純希望唱好一首歌。 很多時候，為了去嘗試新的東西，很容易會忽略最基本的東西沒有做到好。 這樣的狀況，不止是單純說我唱歌，放諸於任何行業也一樣吧。」 工作上的真實時刻
 說到作品，問姜濤如果要在作品中選出四至五首，他會選哪些？ 他想了一想，說：「〈鏡中鏡〉、〈濤〉、〈Master Class〉、〈蒙著嘴說愛你〉、〈孤獨病〉及〈作品說的話〉。」 他輕輕的解釋起來，「〈濤〉是我演唱會的主題曲，代表了整個演唱會的概念，而且用了自己的名字來做歌名，頗有意義。 〈鏡中鏡〉雖然有點爭議，但我覺得這首歌從製作到歌詞各方面都做得很出色。 〈作品說的話〉是我製作的歌曲中的音樂錄像拍攝費最貴也最大規模的。 這些歌就在描述一個故事，代表我不同時期的想法。」 由作品的論述，說到演出，他說：「我是一個不太喜歡每一次演出都表演同一樣東西的人，會覺得很悶。 不過，如果大家會很喜歡我唱某一首歌，我也會唱給大家聽。 試過是粉絲或者有情緒病的人說因為我的歌而心情舒服一點，也試過一次乘坐的士時司機跟我說起我的歌給了他一些能量，我覺得如果我的歌能夠幫助到大家，能夠讓大家開心一點，我也會因此感到很快樂。」 話題漸漸轉到工作，以及參加跟籃球有關的工作活動時，他微笑說：「工作上突然有活動需要打籃球會覺得很開心，打籃球最享受的是可以感受到大家心裡的那團火，而打波的過程大家好直接，在場與隊友的配合靠直覺，是默契。 我跟朋友有一起訓練，練習後也會討論如何可以打得好一點。 平時，看完NBA重播也會跟朋友討論賽果。」 溫暖的光輝
 姜濤露出燦爛笑容的當下，我們正談到了旅行。 他說起了上次跟家人去了歐洲半個月的歡樂時光。 「旅程真的很棒！ 很多時候，當我在旅途上看到甚麼都很想跟家人分享，而這一次帶著家人及親戚去了英國及法國，看到他們站在巴黎街頭非常滿足的神情，就是我最有滿足感的時候。 那次之後，我們也去了美國及日本旅行。」 問他喜歡放長假還是短短幾天的假期，他大笑起來說：「長假！ 不過，又不能放假放太久，不然放假後回歸工作又會不習慣，放兩三星期的假期是最適中最好的。」 「我覺得，去旅行的目的性不要太強，最好可以轉變一種生活方式去感受當地的生活，不要像遊客般走馬看花，這樣就看不到那個地方的真正面貌。 我很喜歡在街上漫步，感受那個地方的氛圍。 而且，在香港很難可以無拘束地四處漫步，因此旅行確實可以讓人放鬆心情。」 忍不住問他，那他偏好寒冷的還是炎熱的地方，「喜歡偏冷的地方，滑雪也是我其中一樣想找機會學學的技能。 最後問他，生活裡最享受的時刻是怎樣？ 他大笑起來，說：「哈哈哈哈，下班的時候。」 好的，我們就此完成訪談，看著他帶笑的離開，讓他享受最享受的完成工作手工的時候吧。 photo by LEUNGMO

mov_D21CAF17E6D88B4C61502E34F9616CDD,2025-07-01 03:51:00,vi,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Với hơn 219.000 mặt hàng giả được thu giữ và tổng giá trị thị trường nếu bán ra tương đương hàng thật lên tới 1,03 tỷ USD, vụ việc được đánh giá là một trong những vụ án hàng giả lớn nhất lịch sử nước Mỹ. Hai nghi phạm, một đế chế hàng giả trị giá tỷ đô Ẩn mình giữa những dãy nhà cao tầng sầm uất của Manhattan, một mạng lưới buôn bán hàng hiệu giả tinh vi đã tồn tại và vận hành âm thầm trong nhiều năm. Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ. Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính. Nó là biểu tượng của một thách thức toàn cầu: khi hàng giả ngày càng tinh vi, thương mại điện tử ngày càng phát triển, và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng ngày càng dễ bị lợi dụng. Mỗi cú nhấp chuột mua hàng mà không kiểm chứng nguồn gốc có thể tiếp tay cho một đường dây tội phạm khổng lồ đang hoạt động ngay giữa lòng đô thị văn minh. Và mỗi vụ án được bóc trần – như đế chế hàng hiệu giả 1 tỷ đô ở Manhattan – là lời nhắc nhở rằng: cuộc chiến chống hàng giả chưa bao giờ đơn giản. Nguồn: Tổng hợp"

La diva del pop aparece con un estilo que fusiona elegancia, intelectualidad y moda genderless en una producción dirigida por el fotógrafo Alex Córdoba . “Indómita”, su quinto álbum de estudio, se lanzó el 5 de junio a través de Warner Music luego de 12 años sin un LP, y debutó en el #1 en México, #12 en Latin Pop Albums de Billboard y #8 en el Top Global Albums . El disco incluye colaboraciones de alto nivel con Natanael Cano, Kenia Os, Jared Leto (Thirty Seconds to Mars) y Natanael Cano, fusionando géneros como pop, corrido tumbado, urbano y regional . “Mentiras, la serie”, producción musical de Prime Video, se estrenó el 13 de junio y ya es la serie más vista en México . Su banda sonora acumula más de 2.4 millones de reproducciones, y revivió clásicos de los 80: Daniela Romo (+170 %), Amanda Miguel (+94 %), Yuri (+64 %) y Lupita D'Alessio (+90 %) . En entrevistas recientes, Belinda destacó que su enfoque creativo para Indómita surgió directamente del concepto: “indómita”, nombre que definió la fuerza interior que la guía . Respecto a “Mentiras”, comentó que no buscó imitar a las voces originales, sino reinterpretar las canciones desde la autenticidad de cada actriz, un sello que la diferenció . Para Elle, Belinda adopta un look que rompe esquemas:     Camisa de rayas (COS) con corbata negra satinada (Dolce & Gabbana), tacones Dior combinados con calcetines, gafas Tommy Hilfiger y reloj Hublot . También presume un smoking sofisticado y un conjunto total look Miu Miu en tonos tierra, reflejando una estética andrógina que juega con lo masculino y femenino . El resultado es una portada que subraya su poderío estilístico y musical, en medio de una reinvención artística que trasciende géneros. Belinda —quien despegó en los años 2000 con telenovelas como Cómplices al rescate, Patito feo y el disco Catarsis (2013)— se consolidó como un icono de moda y música latina . Tras una etapa de colaboraciones y un breve receso, su regreso con “Indómita” y “Mentiras” marca un renacer que ha sido celebrado por críticos y público por igual. Con su portada en Elle, Belinda refleja en imágenes el momento artístico más audaz de su carrera. Sus acciones recientes: un disco ambicioso, una serie que revive clásicos y un estilo rompedor, consolidan a “Beli” como figura central de la cultura pop latinoamericana."

Il faut dire que Mr et Mme Bezos avaient tout prévu, du milliardaire à la cérémonie sur l'île privée de San Giovanni Evangelista, en passant par un bal au sein de l'ancien chantier naval de l'Arsenal. Mais le spectacle le plus attendu était celui des looks de l'ancienne journaliste âgée de 55 ans. La mère de Nikko Gonzalez et d'Evan et Ella Whitesell a en effet préparé son marathon mode dans les moindres détails. Arrivée dans la cité des Doges à bord du Koru le 25 juin, Lauren Sanchez a été débarquée à l'hôtel Aman dans une robe noire drapée Alaïa. Pour leur premier dîner en amoureux le couple s'est ensuite mis sur son 31 : costume noir sobre pour le fondateur de Blue Origin et robe vintage Alexander McQueen pour elle, confectionnée en satin noir et coupée dans le biais avec des rayures en diagonales ornées de sequins brillants, provenant de la collection printemps 2003 de la maison de couture. Nouvelle apparition couture dans la soirée du 26 juin pour le dîner d'accueil de ses noces en l'église Campo della Madonna dell'Orto Venice : l'ex-présentatrice de télévision s'était cette fois-ci glissée dans une robe Schiaparelli à couper le souffle, avec un corset doré serré, ainsi qu'un bustier et une jupe en brocart. Vient ensuite le jour tant attendu, celui de la cérémonie. Pour se rendre sur l'île de San Giorgio Maggiore, Lauren Sanchez a fait preuve d'une élégance à la française, en tailleur-jupe Dior. Elle portait une veste cintrée façon New Look mais avec des manches courtes, associée à une jupe immaculée tombant sous son genou. La mariée avait couvert ses cheveux d'un foulard en soie Hermès, noué autour de son cou et habillé son regard de lunettes de soleil Tom Ford noires surdimensionnées. Robe de mariée Dolce & Gabbana et robe de bal Atelier Versace Clou du spectacle avec sa robe de mariée : la star de la journée s'est inspirée de la robe de mariée de Sophia Loren dans Houseboat et opté pour une robe-corset sirène à manches longues griffée Dolce & Gabbana. Une pièce qu'elle avait commencé à imaginer un an et demi plus tôt, lors d'un dîner chez Domenico Dolce, selon les informations Vogue. La confection a nécessité pas moins de 900 heures de travail ! Le séjour s'est terminé ce 28 juin avec un bal de noces baptisé Dolce Notte, au Venice Arsenale, ancien chantier naval médiéval dans un quartier est de la ville. La soirée avait pour thème une pyjama party et tous les invités ont joué le jeu, enfilant des pyjamas en soie et des robes de chambre chics. Seule Lauren Sanchez dénotait, en véritable reine de la soirée, dans sa robe bustier rose Atelier Versace. Bustier brodé de cristaux Swarovski, jupe plissée vaporeuse… une création digne de l'univers onirique souhaité par le couple !"

mov_FF4881AB674D2F15DFA9581019DA4BC0,2025-07-01 06:50:32,vi,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Hai nghi phạm, một đế chế hàng giả trị giá tỷ đô Ẩn mình giữa những dãy nhà cao tầng sầm uất của Manhattan, một mạng lưới buôn bán hàng hiệu giả tinh vi đã tồn tại và vận hành âm thầm trong nhiều năm. Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ. Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính. Nó là biểu tượng của một thách thức toàn cầu: khi hàng giả ngày càng tinh vi, thương mại điện tử ngày càng phát triển, và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng ngày càng dễ bị lợi dụng. Mỗi cú nhấp chuột mua hàng mà không kiểm chứng nguồn gốc có thể tiếp tay cho một đường dây tội phạm khổng lồ đang hoạt động ngay giữa lòng đô thị văn minh. Và mỗi vụ án được bóc trần – như đế chế hàng hiệu giả 1 tỷ đô ở Manhattan – là lời nhắc nhở rằng: cuộc chiến chống hàng giả chưa bao giờ đơn giản.

Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính. Nó là biểu tượng của một thách thức toàn cầu: khi hàng giả ngày càng tinh vi, thương mại điện tử ngày càng phát triển, và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng ngày càng dễ bị lợi dụng. Mỗi cú nhấp chuột mua hàng mà không kiểm chứng nguồn gốc có thể tiếp tay cho một đường dây tội phạm khổng lồ đang hoạt động ngay giữa lòng đô thị văn minh. Và mỗi vụ án được bóc trần – như đế chế hàng hiệu giả 1 tỷ đô ở Manhattan – là lời nhắc nhở rằng: cuộc chiến chống hàng giả chưa bao giờ đơn giản. Nguồn: Tổng hợp"

The tense moment unfolded outside the Queens courthouse Tuesday (June 4), where her 23-year-old son, Jayson “Jace” Scott, is facing murder charges tied to a 2021 shooting. In a video posted by the woman, who goes by Jazmin Dior, on Instagram, she is heard calling out Remy Ma for “trying to act like you're tough” before telling her to “go around the corner.” Remy Ma didn't back down. “Come on, beat me up,” she said without hesitation, walking down the courthouse steps as the woman followed. The clip cuts off before anything physical is shown, but Dior later posted a photo of Remy Ma on the same steps, handcuffed. View this post on Instagram A post shared by OTFMZLIVE (@otfmzlive) Another video shows both women filming each other while trading insults. Dior later explained her side of the story in a follow-up clip. View this post on Instagram A post shared by OTFMZLIVE (@otfmzlive) “You would have thought I did something to you,” she said. “Realistically, I can never speak to my father again.” She added, “You can see your son.” Dior also accused Remy Ma of glaring at her “with a whole attitude… as if her son was the victim. Like miss, where's your remorse?” Remy Ma's Son Accused Of Fatal Shooting The courthouse drama came after Scott was arraigned on a seven-count indictment, including first- and second-degree murder, reckless endangerment and four counts of criminal possession of a weapon in June 2024. Prosecutors say he was hired to kill 47-year-old Darius Guillebeaux in Queens on June 7, 2021, shooting him multiple times and firing again after he had already fallen. Scott's alleged co-conspirator, 22-year-old Richard Swygert, is facing similar charges and is already serving time for another murder from 2021. Investigators arrested both men last June after linking them to the scene through surveillance footage and phone records. If convicted, Scott could face life in prison without parole. Remy Ma has stood by her son throughout the legal process."

mov_BC8F25DB0697D1D97460723FD7836060,2025-07-01 09:08:29,en,WEB,"  On July 1, 2025, @ArtOfDialogue_ posted a video showing rapper Remy Ma in a verbal altercation with Jazmin Dior, the daughter of her son Jayson Scott's alleged murder victim, outside a courthouse. As reported by NBC News, Remy's son, Jayson Scott, was arrested on charges of first-degree murder in connection with a fatal shooting that occurred in Queens, New York, on June 7, 2021. He was accused of shooting Darius Guillebeaux in Queens and additionally charged with criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment, and second-degree murder. The last known information concerning the charges against Remy's son was a seven-count indictment scheduled for June 25, 2024, alongside his alleged accomplice, Richard Swygert. Both Jayson and Richard were held without bail. ABC7's June 2024 report further noted that if convicted of the top count, Jayson could face life in prison without the possibility of parole. In the now-viral video, Remy Ma is seen recording the victim's daughter while the two engage in a verbal altercation. Jazmin Dior later shared a clip saying that Remy acted like her son was the victim without any remorse, while she can't see her father anymore. Did Remy Ma go to prison? Details explored as daughter of her son's alleged murder victim lashes out In her video calling out Remy Ma's behavior, Jazmin Dior—the daughter of Jayson Scott's alleged murder victim—criticized the rapper for acting tough outside a courthouse, warning that such behavior could land her in jail. Jazmin added that Remy had already been to jail before, questioning if the rapper was trying to go back in with such an attitude. For the unversed, Remy was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2008 after being convicted of criminal possession of a weapon and assault. As reported by Reuters in May 2008, the rapper shot and wounded an acquaintance after discovering that money was missing from her purse following a night out in Manhattan. During sentencing, Criminal Court Judge Rena Uviller described Remy Ma as ""an extremely angry young woman whose anger is completely out of control."" According to the case details, Remy Ma doubted her friend Makeda of taking $3,000 from her. This led to an altercation during which the gun went off while the pair struggled over a purse. The bullet passed through Makeda's colon and hit her rectum, requiring three weeks of hospitalization. Remy's lawyer, Ivan Fisher, defended the rapper by stating that the shooting, which took place on July 14, 2007, was accidental. He claimed the victim, Makeda Barnes-Joseph, put forth an exaggerated claim to acquire a large sum in a separate civil suit. During her appearance on in September 2024, Nick Cannon asked Remy what one thing she would take back in her life if she got the opportunity. Answering the same without hesitation, Remy Ma said: “Not going to prison, ever. The f*ck? Before that, it used to be the worst thing that ever happened was, I got cut in my face… It used to really bother me a lot, and I used to say, this is the worst thing that's ever happened to me."" Apart from the latest controversy, Remy Ma has also made headlines for discussing her separation from Papoose. The former couple married in 2008 while Remy was incarcerated. Papoose filed for divorce in May 2025, citing irreconcilable differences. Feedback Why did you not like this content? Cancel Submit Was this article helpful?

mov_576D4B5C0CDA9AF301121FD9F6CBA3B4,2025-07-01 09:10:06,en,WEB,"  by 01/07/2025 Paris Fashion Week Spring/Summer 2026 has concluded, leaving a lasting impression with a blend of established luxury and innovative design. From Dior's intriguing new direction to Hermès' focus on sophisticated city living, and the playful energy of KidSuper, the menswear collections showcased a diverse range of aesthetics. This season wasn't just about clothes; it was about storytelling, cultural references, and a subtle shift towards comfort and practicality without sacrificing elegance. The shows signaled a move beyond strict formality, embracing a more relaxed yet refined approach to menswear. Dior's Artistic Evolution and a Nod to Wes Anderson Kim Jones' latest collection for Dior presented a compelling new chapter for the iconic house. The collection drew heavily from the aesthetic of the zoot suit, a bold and historically significant style. This unexpected inspiration was executed with Dior's signature tailoring and attention to detail, resulting in a collection that felt both fresh and respectful of its roots. Notably, the show featured a distinct visual echo of Wes Anderson's cinematic style – symmetrical staging and a carefully curated color palette – adding a layer of playful intellectualism. CNN provides a detailed look at the show's key moments. Hermès: The Modern Gentleman's Urban Wardrobe Hermès continued its tradition of understated luxury with a collection designed for the modern city dweller. The emphasis was on versatile pieces crafted from high-quality materials, offering a sophisticated yet effortless style. Silhouettes were relaxed and comfortable, prioritizing ease of movement and practicality. The color palette was muted and refined, reflecting a sense of quiet confidence. Nation.com.pk highlights the collection's focus on comfort and ease. Beyond the Big Names: KidSuper and Ziggy Chen Offer Fresh Perspectives While Dior and Hermès dominated headlines, other designers brought unique visions to the Paris runways. KidSuper presented a whimsical, fairytale-inspired collection, injecting a dose of playful creativity into the menswear landscape. Ziggy Chen, on the other hand, focused on lightness and breathability, utilizing linen fabrics to create a relaxed and airy aesthetic. These emerging designers demonstrate the evolving nature of menswear and the growing demand for individuality and self-expression. FashionUnited.uk provides a comprehensive overview of these and other standout shows. What does this shift towards more relaxed and versatile menswear signify for the future of fashion? And how will established houses like Dior continue to balance tradition with innovation? The Broader Trends Shaping Menswear in 2026 The Paris menswear shows weren't just about individual collections; they reflected broader trends shaping the industry. A key takeaway is the increasing importance of sustainability and ethical production. Designers are under growing pressure to minimize their environmental impact and prioritize fair labor practices. This is leading to a greater focus on durable materials, timeless designs, and responsible sourcing. Another significant trend is the blurring of lines between formal and informal wear. Men are increasingly seeking clothing that can seamlessly transition from the office to social settings. This has resulted in a demand for versatile pieces that can be dressed up or down. Finally, the rise of personalization and customization is empowering consumers to express their individuality through their clothing choices. Brands are responding by offering bespoke services and allowing customers to create unique, one-of-a-kind garments. Hermès' Summer 2026 collection, with its emphasis on refined simplicity, perfectly encapsulates these trends. DA MAN Magazine details the collection's focus on a modern city wardrobe. Similarly, 10 Magazine offers a concise overview of Hermès' SS26 menswear presentation. Frequently Asked Questions About Paris Fashion Week SS26 Q: What was the key inspiration behind Dior's SS26 menswear collection?

Сегодня книги стали незаменимой частью массовой культуры: селебрити охотно позируют с новинками на камеру,  а бренды включают их в маркетинговые кампании. Некоторые просто начали скупать книги, чтобы казаться умнее и привлекательнее — одни ставят их как фон для видеозвонков, другие берут их с собой на прогулку как красивый аксессуар.   Книжные клубы также становятся новой популярной формой досуга. Все больше знаменитостей запускают свои читательские сообщества, где ежемесячно предлагают новую книгу и обсуждают ее с подписчиками.  Впрочем, сегодня, чтобы стать участником клуба, не нужно быть фанатом конкретной звезды — тематические сообщества легко найти как в офлайне, так и онлайн. Их создают книжные магазины, издательства, культурные пространства и просто любители литературы. Фото: Ugur Akdemir / Unsplash Механика книжных клубов довольно проста: участники заранее договариваются, какую книгу читают, а затем собираются, чтобы обсудить прочитанное. Формат встреч может быть любым — от офлайн-собраний в кафе до регулярных Zoom-сессий. Иногда книги читают вслух прямо на встречах. Обычно разговор ведет модератор — он помогает структурировать обсуждение, предлагает вопросы и следит за ходом беседы. В некоторых клубах к встречам присоединяются гости — авторы, переводчики, редакторы или книжные блогеры. Как зародились книжные клубы Идея собираться вместе, чтобы обсуждать книги, уходит корнями в античность. Еще в школе Сократа ученики рассуждали не только о литературе, но и о философии, политике и природе человека. Более привычный для нас формат появился позже — одним из первых стал клуб «Джунто», основанный Бенджамином Франклином в XVIII веке. Участники встречались по пятницам, чтобы говорить о литературе, а также организовали общественные проекты. Коммерческая модель книжного клуба появилась в 1926 году. Американец Гарри Шерман придумал подписной сервис Little Leather Library — за $2,98 читатели получали 30 небольших книг и шоколад в подарок. Позже проект перерос в клуб «Книга месяца», где редакторы выбирали важные произведения и рассылали их подписчикам.  Современный всплеск популярности начался в 1996 году, когда телеведущая Опра Уинфри запустила собственный книжный клуб. В рамках своей передачи она рекомендовала новинки, обсуждала их со зрителями и авторами. Проект стал настолько успешным, что вскоре за ним последовали другие знаменитости.  Сейчас книжные клубы есть у Сары Джессики Паркер, Дуа Липы и Риз Уизерспун. Последний — Reese's Book Club — стал настоящим феноменом: книги, попадающие в его список, неизменно становятся бестселлерами на годы. Только в 2023 году ее рекомендации разошлись тиражом более 2,3 миллиона экземпляров. Фото: Face to Face / Global Look Press К книжным клубам подключились и модные бренды. В 2024 году Miu Miu провел первую встречу своего литературного клуба в Милане, собрав представителей индустрии, журналистов и медийных персон. Chanel развивает проект Les Rendez-vous littéraires rue Cambon,  где они знакомят читателей с женской литературой. Dior также не остался в стороне — бренд посвящает литературе специальные мероприятия, приуроченные к новым коллекциям. Чем объясняется популярность книжных сообществ сегодня В мире, где цифровые технологии вытесняют живое общение, а ощущение одиночества становится все более распространенным, особенно среди молодежи, людям все чаще требуется так называемое «третье место» — пространство, отличное от дома и работы, где можно регулярно встречаться и общаться.  Книжные клубы как раз стали такой площадкой. Они дают возможность обсуждать прочитанное в кругу единомышленников, высказывать мнение, слушать других и развивать критическое мышление. Это не только способ взглянуть на текст под новым углом, но и повод выработать привычку к регулярному чтению и вдумчивому восприятию информации. Популярность литературных сообществ сегодня усиливается за счет внимания со стороны известных персон. Книги все чаще появляются в руках у селебрити, а книжные рекомендации становятся частью публичного образа.  Кроме того, важную роль сыграли социальные сети. В TikTok активно развивается сообщество BookTok, где пользователи делятся короткими отзывами, подборками, инсайтами и участвуют в литературных челленджах. Это вовлекло в чтение новую аудиторию и сделало обсуждение книг популярным форматом досуга. Что почитать по советам ведущих сообществ книголюбов Рейчел Каск — «Дело жизни» Фото: Faber & Faber Книжный клуб Chanel, существующий как в офлайне, так и в онлайн формате, выпуская видео со знаменитостями на YouTube.

Der er lidt af hvert – lige fra hylende morsomt feministisk hævntogt til en ikonisk western, afdankede pornostjerner, et barskt familiedrama og en hjertevarm hyggeversion af 'The Devil Wears Prada'. 'Promising Young Woman' Carey Mulligan tager sagen i egen hånd i 'Promising Young Woman' Foto: Focus Features Før kvinden bag 'Saltburn' fik os alle til at gå i kollektiv sexpsykose, mens vi kronisk havde 00'er-popsangen 'Murder on the Dancefloor' på hjernen og ikke rigtig kunne slette synet af en nøgen, dansende Barry Keoghan fra nethinden, var der 'Promising Young Woman'. Emerald Fennells fuldstændig forrygende, tankevækkende og ekstremt underholdende spillefilmsdebut, der sikrede hende en Oscar for bedste originale manuskript. Filmen har et guddommeligt soundtrack og handler om kvinden Cassie (Carey Mulligan), der forgæves forsøger at holde sit liv ud, efter at hendes bedste veninde går bort. Cassie får nu sine lange, ensomme nætter til at gå med at lege en form for sexet, kvindelig Batman-selvtægtshelt, der gør gaderne usikre for klamme mænd, der vil udnytte stangstive kvinder. Hun har et kynisk syn på hankøn og tror altid det værste. Cassie er derfor meget skeptisk, da kærligheden rammer hende i skikkelse af den vidunderlige børnelæge Ryan, spillet af klassekomikeren Bo Burnham. 'Red Rocket' 'Red Rocket' Foto: A24 Sean Baker, manden bag årets helt store Oscar-succes, 'Anora', er afgjort en af de mest interessante amerikanske instruktører pt. Han slog filmkarrieren an med 'Tangerine' og 'The Florida Project' og har siden vendt sit følsomme, forstående og imødekommende blik mod pornoindustrien og sexarbejde i 'Red Rocket'. Det er en morsom, men også socialrealistisk komedie, der handler om en falleret pornostjerne, der vender tilbage til sin hjemby i Texas. Hans navn er Mikey ""Saber"" Davies og spilles af 'Scary Movie'-stjernen Simon Rex. Mikey kan ikke finde sig til rette i hjembyen, der synes klaustrofobisk lille for ham. Mens han laver fejl på stribe, forsøger han at genopfinde sig selv og planlægger et storslået, sexet comeback til pornoscenen i Hollywood. 'Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris' En fornem greve (Lambert Wilson) og Mrs. Harris (Lesley Manville) deltager i et Dior-show i 'Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris' Foto: Dávid Lukács / Focus Features Hvis 'The Devil Wears Prada' og 'Phantom Thread' fik et feelgood-filmbarn, ville det være 'Mrs. Harris Goes to Paris'. Den charmerende, historiske komedie handler om en enke, der pludselig kommer til penge. Hun har altid sørget for andre, men på sine ældre dage indser rengøringskonen Ada Harris (Lesley Manville), at hun faktisk også selv fortjener lidt forkælelse. I et vildt forsøg på at finde sin drømmekjole fra Dior rejser hun derfor til Paris. Her kunne man forestille sig, at eventyret endte brat og hurtigt udviklede sig til den ubehøvlede sekvens i 'Pretty Woman', hvor den prostituerede Vivian fornærmes af snobbede butiksassistenter. Men i den her magiske, britiske fortælling er det modsatte tilfældet – og snart kommer Ada Harris på sit livs eventyr. 'Den gode, den onde og den grusomme' Eli Wallach og Clint Eastwood i 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' fra 1966 af Sergio Leone. Foto: United Artists En tør, støvet vind blæser gennem en øde bygd. Her emmer stilheden før stormen af kugleregn i Sergio Leones mest ikoniske spaghettiwestern, der bugner af lange pauser, nærbilleder og intense dueller, der får en til at sidde på kanten af sofaen. I westernfilmen over dem alle tørner tre vidt forskellige mænd sammen: Den gode Blondie spilles af Clint Eastwood, der er en supercool og tilsyneladende hæderlig dusørjæger. Den onde skurk, Angel Eyes (Lee Van Cleef), er derimod en ubarmhjertig og hensynsløs lejemorder, der dræber uden at tøve. Og til sidst er der den grimme Tuco (Eli Wallach), som er en snu forbryder, der på listig vis altid undgår straf og snor sig ud af selv de mest håbløse situationer med skindet i behold. Til fælles har de alle, at de vil have fingre i en stor skat, der efter sigende er begravet på en kirkegård. Hver især har de små brikker af puslespillet, der kan føre dem mod enorm rigdom. Spørgsmålet er bare, hvem der først når frem, og hvad de hver især er villige til at gøre for, at de andre ikke gør.

Filmen har Kathy Bates og Jessica Tandy i rollerne som to kvinder, der gennem fortællingen om en vild livshistorie kommer tættere på hinanden. Det sker, da den undertrykte husmor Evelyn (Bates) møder den ældre kvinde Ninny Threadgoode (Tandy) på et plejehjem...."

As reported by NBC News, Remy's son, Jayson Scott, was arrested on charges of first-degree murder in connection with a fatal shooting that occurred in Queens, New York, on June 7, 2021. He was accused of shooting Darius Guillebeaux in Queens and additionally charged with criminal possession of a weapon, reckless endangerment, and second-degree murder. The last known information concerning the charges against Remy's son was a seven-count indictment scheduled for June 25, 2024, alongside his alleged accomplice, Richard Swygert. Both Jayson and Richard were held without bail. ABC7's June 2024 report further noted that if convicted of the top count, Jayson could face life in prison without the possibility of parole. In the now-viral video, Remy Ma is seen recording the victim's daughter while the two engage in a verbal altercation. Jazmin Dior later shared a clip saying that Remy acted like her son was the victim without any remorse, while she can't see her father anymore. In her video calling out Remy Ma's behavior, Jazmin Dior—the daughter of Jayson Scott's alleged murder victim—criticized the rapper for acting tough outside a courthouse, warning that such behavior could land her in jail. Jazmin added that Remy had already been to jail before, questioning if the rapper was trying to go back in with such an attitude. For the unversed, Remy was sentenced to eight years in prison in 2008 after being convicted of criminal possession of a weapon and assault. As reported by Reuters in May 2008, the rapper shot and wounded an acquaintance after discovering that money was missing from her purse following a night out in Manhattan. During sentencing, Criminal Court Judge Rena Uviller described Remy Ma as ""an extremely angry young woman whose anger is completely out of control."" According to the case details, Remy Ma doubted her friend Makeda of taking $3,000 from her. This led to an altercation during which the gun went off while the pair struggled over a purse. The bullet passed through Makeda's colon and hit her rectum, requiring three weeks of hospitalization. Remy's lawyer, Ivan Fisher, defended the rapper by stating that the shooting, which took place on July 14, 2007, was accidental. He claimed the victim, Makeda Barnes-Joseph, put forth an exaggerated claim to acquire a large sum in a separate civil suit. During her appearance on We Playin' Spades in September 2024, Nick Cannon asked Remy what one thing she would take back in her life if she got the opportunity. Answering the same without hesitation, Remy Ma said: Apart from the latest controversy, Remy Ma has also made headlines for discussing her separation from Papoose. The former couple married in 2008 while Remy was incarcerated. Papoose filed for divorce in May 2025, citing irreconcilable differences."

418372e327970a1faad18720f3f7ac6d,2025-07-01 11:16:00,pt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]PN - Ter dinheiro não significa ter bom gosto! Decididamente foi um circo de horrores. É a história de uma cidade e dois casamentos com uma década de intervalo e um abismo ainda maior em termos de estilo e dignidade. Enquanto Veneza se recupera da tomada de poder cafona das núpcias de US$ 20 milhões de Bezos e Sanchez, com seus protestos anticapitalistas, tempestades estranhas e o onipresente decote Kardashian, lembro-me de quando a Cidade Flutuante sediou o grande dia de uma celebridade de classe mundial. Em 2014, George e Amal Clooney estabeleceram o modelo Dolce Vita para a alta sociedade italiana no elegante Aman Grand Canal Hotel, de sete estrelas, com uma aula magistral sobre protagonistas românticos clássicos, dignos da antiga Cidade do Amor. Com um orçamento relativamente modesto de US$ 4,6 milhões, o casal, que se conheceu na Itália um ano antes, casou-se diante de apenas 60 convidados. A plateia, que incluía alguns VIPs, incluindo Anna Wintour e Cindy Crawford , estava impecavelmente vestida, em vez de pela metade – ao contrário de Kim, Khloé, Kylie e Kendall, que estavam entre as muitas ""estrelas"" que se exibiram nas celebrações dos Bezos. George exibia um terno Armani de cashmere feito sob medida, enquanto a advogada libanesa britânica de direitos humanos, Amal, personificava a elegância em um recatado vestido de noiva Oscar de la Renta, de renda. Resumindo, os fotogênicos Clooneys estavam prontos para o close sem parecerem especialmente desesperados por isso, o que não pode ser dito dos posers com sorriso irônico, Jeff e Lauren. Porque a atmosfera geral desse casamento, ao longo de três dias de celebração, estava mais para reality show do que para a velha Hollywood. Mesmo usando um smoking clássico e exibindo um visual renovado, Jeff parecia mais um vendedor prestes a participar de uma conferência do que um titã da tecnologia. Sejamos realistas, o tom foi dado quando os ""pombinhos"" (com idade combinada de 111 anos) deram início aos eventos com uma festa de espuma no convés de seu iate de US$ 500 milhões. A dupla parece ter o dom de fazer gastos exorbitantes parecerem espetacularmente baratos. Por que se contentar em apenas alugar um hotel quando você pode alugar uma ilha inteira? (San Giorgio Maggiore, neste caso, para a cerimônia em si). Por que perder a chance de trocar seu anel de noivado de diamante rosa de 30 quilates e US$ 3 milhões por um anel de diamante de 35 quilates do tamanho de um ovo? Ambos lembram peças de fantasia desajeitadas, quando comparados ao clássico deslumbrante de Amal, de US$ 500.000 e sete quilates, extraído eticamente. E enquanto Amal impressionou com três looks icônicos - um terninho Stella McCartney de seda creme com detalhes azul-marinho para a cerimônia civil no Palácio Ca' Farsetti, um vestido Oscar de la Renta marfim para o casamento e um prateado para a recepção - Sanchez optou por uma série exaustiva de trocas de figurino. Os 'destaques' incluíram um vestido espartilho Schiaparelli incrivelmente justo — e, por US$ 100.000, caro — que ela usou no jantar de boas-vindas na quinta-feira à noite, parecendo uma garçonete do Medieval Times. Depois, veio a festa completa, com um lenço Hermès e um tailleur creme Dior no dia seguinte. Se a intenção era homenagear o ícone italiano Sophia Loren, o resultado foi frustrante, parecendo mais uma paródia do que um eco fiel do chique despojado da estrela. Na verdade, o vestido de noiva de Sanchez – de gola alta e feito de renda italiana aplicada à mão – marcou um raro momento de contenção discreta. É claro que a verdadeira maneira de impor suas credenciais de 0,0001% goela abaixo de todo mundo é com uma segurança rigorosa. De andaimes horríveis e fechamentos de ruas até o monopólio dos táxis aquáticos, foi difícil para os grandes desavisados ​​tentarem cuidar de seus negócios em Veneza na semana passada. É bastante claro por que muitos venezianos ficaram irritados, em vez de encantados, com essa história de amor. As comemorações relativamente modestas dos Clooneys causaram pouca comoção nos canais da cidade. Com informações Mailonline Contribuição para o blog DOE AQUI. Faça a sua publicidade AQUI .

My skin is sensitive, acne-prone, and combination, so I really need something that: * Doesn't clog pores or break me out * Feels lightweight and comfortable * Lasts all day (I'm usually out from 6:30 AM to 7:30 PM, with gym after work — I can wash my face before the gym to remove makeup, but sometimes it's a hassle. That said, I'd rather have healthy skin, and the weather in my region is extremely hot in the summer and very cold in the winter) * I will be using that one product all over my face thinly for when I have events and such, but I only do that when there is something going on which is maximum 12 times a year and maybe even less. * Is actually worth the money (no fading, caking, or separating) **Budget for makeup:** I'd rather avoid expensive products that break the bank, but I'm willing to spend if it's something I'll truly use and not regret buying. I will be using that single product for a year or two, depending on its shelf life.

UgxHBWDe6zUAR4PAeQ14AaABAg,2025-07-01 12:00:57,en,YOUTUBE,"  Aloha gorgeous, Wow, that Guerlain palette was made for you! So gorgeous, and I think you could wear it year round. For the Guerlain powder, I like the translucent all over, but more so for under the eyes, and any where I need brightening. It has a slight pink tint to it. The Medium powder I like all over, not under my eyes. It's a bit too dark under the eyes for me. I also love the medium shade if my foundation looks a bit too light, and it's gorgeous over a tinted SPF too. The powder is amazing, I agree with the container being a bit too big. I wish they would have included a smaller container to decant for travel. That would be great, especially for the price. I have to try a Guerlain blush, I'm having a hard time picking out a shade.I don't have a store nearby where I can swatch. Our Nordstrom is far, and they seem to not have much selection of Guerlain even on line. I'm not sure what's going on. My new obsession is the Prada eye shadows. I have 3 palettes, and I love them so much. Along with the Dior Cannage LE palettes. Have you tried the Dior Cannage yet? I think you would love Brown Cashmere. It's so gorgeous!! The formula is comparable to the Prada. I want to try the Guerlain shadows, but I haven't found a color story that resonates yet. Lately I've been into the smaller palettes versus large palettes. Just easier to put a look together when you're short on time. Thank you for your video, hope you're all enjoying the Summer! Xoxo PS. I love the Guerlain concealer it's lovely for the summer. I wish it came in a plastic container versus the glass, and the wand was easier to get out. I dropped mine on my tile floor, and it shattered. I order another one. What do you think about the Gucci concealer? I would like to try it, but can't figure out what shade."

Minis and maxis receive abundant fanfare, but the trusty midi is relatively uncelebrated, doing the hard work of clothing us for summer weddings and work events and everything in-between. Well, until now. This season, the midi dress finally found its way out of everyday rotation and onto the SS25 catwalks, where designers celebrated the calf-grazing style in multiple guises. The summer midi dress – be it figure-skimming and polka dotted or oversized and airy – is finally being given the attention it deserves. Consider a summer dress with an interesting neckline, namely something strapless or asymmetric. Specifically, we can't stop thinking about Versace's slinky, floral bandeau dress, which was styled with metallic chartreuse sling-backs and a mini bag (hello again, Y2K) on the runway. Meanwhile, Dior, Bottega Veneta and Jacquemus all made a case for the one-shoulder LBD. Read Next Speaking of LBDs, there were plenty more – but not as you know them. Enter the Loose Black Dress – a billowing, much more comfortable alternative to its comparatively littler counterpart. See Simone Rocha and Tibi's offerings (which have pockets!) or Khaite's cut-out tunic dress, offering a glimpse of body beneath the swathes of fabric. On and off the runway, the polka-dot dress occupies a prize spot (pun intended). Notable mentions go to the 1990s-inspired, tomato-red, halterneck midi Kaia Gerber wore to the Tribeca Film Festival last month, and the wispy spot-print slip from Charles Jeffrey Loverboy's SS25 collection. A satin slip is also a fine idea, as advocated by Alexa Chung, Dries Van Noten, and an abundance of editors at fashion week. When it comes to summer midi dresses, the choices are plenty. Luckily, we've narrowed it down for you with our curated edit. A Polka-Dot Summer Midi Dress French Connection Polka Dot Midi Dress Zara Polka-Dot Midi Dress Abercrombie & Fitch Halter Knee-Length Slip Dress Now 44% Off Depending on whether you opt for a fit-and-flare dress or a bias-cut, halterneck style, polka dots can read Fifties or Nineties – such are their versatility.

AI influencers, also known as virtual influencers, are quickly becoming one of the most talked-about trends in the influencer marketing world. These digital personalities, often powered by AI and CGI, can look and behave like real people. Some are animated or stylized, while others are nearly indistinguishable from humans. While AI influencers won't replace human creators, they are changing the game, offering new opportunities for creative campaigns, brand storytelling, and customer interaction. Understanding how to work with these digital personas is key for marketers who want to stay ahead of the curve. In this article, CreatorDB explores the evolution of AI influencers, why they're gaining popularity, how leading brands are using them, and what this trend means for the future of influencer marketing. What Are AI Influencers? AI influencers are digital personas created using AI tools and CGI. They behave like human influencers, posting content, engaging with followers, and partnering with brands, but they are not real people. Some are managed by agencies, while others are entirely autonomous with AI-generated visuals and personalities. According to The Conversation, there are three main types of AI influencers: Non-Humans – Characters that are clearly fictional (e.g., mascots). Animated Humans – Stylized or cartoon-like personas. Hyper-Realistic CGI Humans – Nearly indistinguishable from real people. Some of the most well-known examples include: LilMiquela – Fashion and music influencer with over 2.7 million followers. Imma – A Japanese virtual model with a highly engaged following. Kuki – An interactive chatbot with a social media presence. A Brief History of Virtual Influencers The concept of AI influencers first came out in the early 2010s. Back then, the early versions of AI influencers were simply virtual characters in the gaming and entertainment industry. As AI and computer graphics developed, these characters started to have more nuances and became more sophisticated, eventually becoming the virtual influencers we see today. In 2016, the world welcomed Lil Miquela, who is considered the first official hyperrealistic AI influencer in history. After her release, there were a ton of debates about whether she was a real person or not. Since then, the virtual influencer industry has exploded: CB from Casa Bahia – A Brazilian virtual mascot with over 10M followers. Milla Sofia – An AI-generated influencer using diffusion models. Brand-created influencers – From Lu of Magalu to Noonoouri, companies are building and managing their own digital ambassadors. Why Are Brands Turning to AI Influencers? Though still niche, AI influencers appeal to brands for several compelling reasons: Total control over content, messaging, and brand representation No scandals or PR risks, unlike human influencers Always available for campaigns and engagement Cost-effective over time High novelty value, boosting brand buzz and attention Besides those reasons, according to Influencer Marketing Hub data, AI influencers are collecting excellent feedback from the marketers who worked with them and inspiring more collaborations: 59.8% of marketing professionals have worked with AI influencers 15.5% plan to collaborate with AI influencers Over 60% of those who once collaborated with virtual influencers are satisfied. Since AI influencers don't exist as people outside of their social media feeds, a team of professionals manages them, making it easier to align them with the specifics of a marketing campaign. CreatorDB Case Studies: How Brands Are Using AI Influencers Although there is still no data about how effective AI influencers are compared to traditional influencers, it is clear that the fit with the product is still the most critical factor for a successful influencer marketing campaign. Audiences might be happy to see the innovation of AI influencers, but they may find human influencers more relatable regarding certain products. Still, AI influencers are great if brands want to showcase an innovative image and position themselves at the forefront of a trend. CreatorDB found three case studies in different industries to help you better understand how to work with AI influencers. 1.

mov_AE68DC4D03200A163F33590A8D76A3BC,2025-07-01 13:11:00,en,WEB,"  The global personal luxury goods market, valued at USD 410 billion in 2024, is projected to reach USD 526 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.24%. The U.S.-China trade war poses challenges, impacting costs and availability. Key trends include circular economy initiatives, online retail strategies, and urban demand in emerging markets. Segment growth varies, with watches and jewelry leading, while beauty and fragrances witness fastest growth. APAC remains the dominant region, driven by urbanization and digital retail transformation. Major players like LVMH and Rolex leverage strategic partnerships and innovation to maintain market positioning. Personal Luxury Goods Market Dublin, July 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Personal Luxury Goods Market Research Report 2025-2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Personal Luxury Goods Market was valued at USD 410 billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 526 billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 4.24%. The global personal luxury goods market is fragmented and characterized by numerous manufacturers that hold modest market share. Key players, including LVH, Prada Group, Rolex, Kering, and Richemont, among others, have established dominance in the market by continuously innovating and expanding their product offerings. Major vendors are strategically implementing innovative technologies to maintain their market positions. For instance, in 2023, Burberry introduced its virtual store by partnering with Blankos Block Party, a gaming platform, and offering interactive product discovery. The companies in the personal luxury goods industry are also focusing on several strategic partnerships with other providers to ensure continuous supply chains and manufacturing capabilities. For instance, in 2023, Kering completed a 30% acquisition of the Italian luxury fashion house Valentino. The partnership is between Valentino's parent company, Mayhoola, and it has also provided an option for Kering to acquire the remaining 70% by 2028. The leaders in the personal luxury goods market are making significant R&D investments to enhance the availability and differentiation of their products. For instance, in 2024, Richemont acquired Vhernier, which is an Italian jewelry brand, to enhance its Jewelry Maisons division. Furthermore, companies are increasingly expanding their product range and strengthening their market positions through acquisitions and partnerships. For instance, in 2024, Lavie Luxe launched its new 18% fragrance concentration perfume line, featuring four Eau de Parfum fragrances named LUSH, LILY, LAGOON, and LOVE. Consumers are increasingly interested in luxury goods that are designed with circular economic principles, such as those that can be easily upcycled. Gucci was the first luxury brand to use ECONYL recycled nylon in ready-wear pieces, which is a 100% recycled nylon derived from fishing nets, textile waste, and a thick pile fabric used for carpets and upholstery. Luxury brands have increasingly adopted online approaches to meet evolving consumer expectations. For instance, in 2023, Dior was the most popular luxury brand online because of its strategic investments in digital marketing, e-commerce, and social media engagement. This approach helped the brand to engage a wider audience, which has boosted its online sales, especially in markets like China and the US. Brands strategically position themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops in places like Bali and Phuket. It has created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. Hence, such factors are supporting the demand for the personal luxury goods market across emerging nations. As the global economies continue to grow, disposable income levels rise, leading to increased spending on luxury items like footwear. Consumers are increasingly inclined towards luxury footwear because of changing lifestyles and fashion trends. Luxury footwear companies are focusing on the growing consumer base in developing countries such as India and other Southeast Asian countries, where wealth and demand for luxury goods are rising. In 2022, Louis Vuitton introduced its exclusive footwear collection for the Indian market, which features new colors like Rani Pink and glittering designs for celebrating India's cultural heritage. Urbanization in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia continues to drive demand for the personal luxury goods market. In India, platforms like Luxepolis have significantly supported the development of the market by offering new and pre-owned luxury items to a growing audience in smaller cities, as the growing urban population increases the demand for high-end items. Brands are strategically positioning themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops to places like Bali and Phuket. Additionally, collaborations between fashion houses and hospitality venues such as Fendi's beach club in Marbella have created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS The disruption in the supply chain has led to increased costs for raw materials, logistics, and transportation, which have raised operational costs and are often passed on to end consumers which leading to higher luxury goods prices. The focus on limited production to maintain exclusivity significantly raises the production costs for luxury brands. Brands often face higher unit costs for manufacturing, sourcing premium materials, and utilizing skilled labor for producing limited edition items. This limits scalability and hampers the personal luxury goods market demand. Furthermore, major brands occasionally face backlash for products or marketing campaigns, such as Louis Vuitton for selling a scarf inspired by the Palestinian keffiyeh and a jacket that seems to present Jamaican culture by using the country's flags but incorrectly represented. These factors hamper the brand value and show the need for careful consideration in global marketing efforts. PERSONAL LUXURY GOODS MARKET GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS The APAC region dominated the global personal luxury goods market, accounting for a share of over 38% in 2024. APAC is experiencing a surge in urbanization and rising disposable income, particularly in countries like China, India, and Southeast Asian countries. A growing middle and upper-middle class is driving demand for luxury goods as markers of status, success, and aspiration. As consumers become more brand-conscious, luxury ownership is increasingly viewed as a symbol of achievement...."

I'm hoping that makes it a bit easier. I'll keep you posted ☺️. I haven't tried the Dior one but I keep thinking I need to order it, everyone loves it. Maybe I'll see if it's still available today maybe even look for a 4th of July sale or something 😁. Oh I LOVE the Gucci concealer. It's so nice.

mov_0F616B39CDCF16B93AE3EDD8AD4F4C1C,2025-07-01 14:10:45,en,WEB,"  An everyday lipstick, like any other part of a makeup or beauty routine, is inherently personal and varies from person to person. I've gone through practically every phase imaginable. At one point, a bright cherry red was my go-to. At another, I wanted a nude lipstick so subtle I could barely tell it apart from my natural lip color—the versatility is part of what makes playing with makeup so fun. Still, there are a few boxes that your go-to formula should easily check. “A great everyday lipstick is all about balance,” says celebrity makeup artist Ash K. Holm. “It should be comfortable, long-wearing, and easy to apply without a mirror.” Holm adds that a formula that hydrates the lips is ideal, but it also needs enough pigment to pull a look together. On top of that, it should fade evenly—no harsh lines as it wears off throughout the day. Sounds like a tall order? It is, but that's where I come in. Next to blush, lipstick is one of my absolute favorite makeup categories to test, and I've come across quite a few that can satisfy even the pickiest beauty lover. Keep reading to find the everyday lipstick that deserves a spot in your collection. The Best Everyday Lipsticks Best Everyday Lipstick Overall MAC Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick in Thanks, It's Mac! MAC's Lustreglass Lipstick, specifically in the shade Thanks It's MAC, is the closest thing to a truly universal lipstick that I have ever found. It's a taupey pink with a silver pearl, but don't let that scare you—the shimmer is virtually nonexistent in this formula once you swipe it onto your lips. One of my favorite things about this shade is that it can be worn with or without a lip liner, and it layers beautifully. Finish: Glossy Key Ingredients: Castor seed oil, shea butter, squalane (moisturizing) What I Love: Looks good on the majority of skin tones; Sleek packaging; Barely-there scent What I Don't: Due to the emollience of the formula, it wears off quickly Review for MC: “This is one of my favorite lipsticks of all time, and for good reason. It's a neutral-toned taupe pink color that doesn't veer too cool or warm, making it perfectly suitable for a variety of skin tones. It also layers beautifully with other lipstick formulas in my collection, acting almost like a traditional gloss by depositing color without taking over the entire look.” — Ariel Baker, Beauty Writer Ariel Baker testing MAC Lustreglass Sheer-Shine Lipstick in Thanks, Its Mac! (Image credit: Ariel Baker) Best Everyday Neutral Lipstick NYX Smushy Matte Lip Balm in Soft Smile This is a newer formula to my makeup routine, but I'm so glad I came across it. The Smush Matte Lip Balms sound a little confusing (mainly because I've never used a lip balm that's actually matte before), but once I applied it, I saw the magic in the formula. I'd consider this more of a blurring lipstick, similar to soft-focus formulas popular in the K-Beauty space. The shade Soft Smile, a brown nude, is the closest I've gotten to a true skin-toned match on myself in a long time, but it also works nicely as a neutral across a majority of skin tones. And as the brand claims, it really does blur the lines in my lips, creating a gorgeous, soft-matte canvas. Finish: Matte Key Ingredients: Dimethicone (silicone base that smooths lines); Ceramide np (improves skin barrier function); Shea butter (moisturizes) What I Love: 12 shades; Most affordable lipstick on this list What I Don't: Strong caramel scent that lingers for a bit before fading, which is a personal preference Review for MC: “This is such a fun lipstick to keep in my purse. Not only is it super compact, but the formula feels almost like a traditional silicone primer on my lips, and just like those formulas, it blurs the lines and imperfections on the area while depositing color—a win-win if you ask me. While it has a strong scent, I'm completely willing to overlook it not only for the unique formula but also the gorgeous nude shade that is Soft Smile, which complements my skin tone perfectly.” — Ariel Baker, Beauty Writer Ariel Baker testing NYX Smushy Matte Lip Balm in Soft Smile.

Half of the systems including Click and Collect are still down despite online orders being restarted in June, the retailer's boss said. Stuart Machin told the retailer's annual general meeting that after the brand goes 'fully on' the focus will then be on getting its Castle Donington distribution centre in the East Midlands 'back and running'. He said that 'we will have the vast majority of this behind us' by August. Hackers disrupted contactless payments and Click and Collect during the cyber attack in April. The retailer then confirmed that customer data had been stolen, although it said no passwords or card details were accessed. The attack will wipe around £300 million from this year's profits, the chain has estimated, with the losses only being partly covered by insurance. Online orders have resumed in England, Scotland and Wales, but customers in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland are still waiting for the service. Mr Machin said: 'Currently, half of online is open but not areas like Click and Collect. Within the next four weeks we are hoping for the whole of online to be fully on. 'Then our focus will be getting the Donington site back and running.' The high street giant has previously said that the disruption to services will continue into June and July. Last week, it sent out e-gift cards to customers who had online orders cancelled or had click and collect orders delayed. A message on the M&S website today reads: 'We will resume Click & Collect, Next Day Delivery and UK Nominated Day Delivery for fashion and international ordering in the coming weeks.' The retailer is just one of many household names that have been hacked recently including Co-op, Harrods and Dior. In April,  Co-op had to shut down its IT systems to stop hackers from snatching personal and financial information like shopper passwords or bank details. As with the  M&S cyber attack, Co-op shoppers were left contending with empty shelves and deliveries being paused. Do you have a story you would like to share? Contact josh.layton@metro.co.uk"

mov_FDD16DCD57A31E091D8DD457A8FE5E34,2025-07-01 17:49:44,en,WEB,"  If you are working in influencer marketing, you must have heard of the new buzzword: AI influencers. AI influencers, also known as virtual influencers, are quickly becoming one of the most talked-about trends in the influencer marketing world. These digital personalities, often powered by AI and CGI, can look and behave like real people. Some are animated or stylized, while others are nearly indistinguishable from humans. While AI influencers won't replace human creators, they are changing the game, offering new opportunities for creative campaigns, brand storytelling, and customer interaction. Understanding how to work with these digital personas is key for marketers who want to stay ahead of the curve. In this article, CreatorDB explores the evolution of AI influencers, why they're gaining popularity, how leading brands are using them, and what this trend means for the future of influencer marketing. What Are AI Influencers? AI influencers are digital personas created using AI tools and CGI. They behave like human influencers, posting content, engaging with followers, and partnering with brands, but they are not real people. Some are managed by agencies, while others are entirely autonomous with AI-generated visuals and personalities. According to The Conversation, there are three main types of AI influencers: Non-Humans – Characters that are clearly fictional (e.g., mascots). Animated Humans – Stylized or cartoon-like personas. Hyper-Realistic CGI Humans – Nearly indistinguishable from real people. Some of the most well-known examples include: LilMiquela – Fashion and music influencer with over 2.7 million followers. Imma – A Japanese virtual model with a highly engaged following. Kuki – An interactive chatbot with a social media presence. A Brief History of Virtual Influencers The concept of AI influencers first came out in the early 2010s. Back then, the early versions of AI influencers were simply virtual characters in the gaming and entertainment industry. As AI and computer graphics developed, these characters started to have more nuances and became more sophisticated, eventually becoming the virtual influencers we see today. In 2016, the world welcomed Lil Miquela, who is considered the first official hyperrealistic AI influencer in history. After her release, there were a ton of debates about whether she was a real person or not. Since then, the virtual influencer industry has exploded: CB from Casa Bahia – A Brazilian virtual mascot with over 10M followers. Milla Sofia – An AI-generated influencer using diffusion models. Brand-created influencers – From Lu of Magalu to Noonoouri, companies are building and managing their own digital ambassadors. Why Are Brands Turning to AI Influencers? Though still niche, AI influencers appeal to brands for several compelling reasons: Total control over content, messaging, and brand representation No scandals or PR risks, unlike human influencers Always available for campaigns and engagement Cost-effective over time High novelty value, boosting brand buzz and attention Besides those reasons, according to Influencer Marketing Hub data, AI influencers are collecting excellent feedback from the marketers who worked with them and inspiring more collaborations: 59.8% of marketing professionals have worked with AI influencers 15.5% plan to collaborate with AI influencers Over 60% of those who once collaborated with virtual influencers are satisfied. Since AI influencers don't exist as people outside of their social media feeds, a team of professionals manages them, making it easier to align them with the specifics of a marketing campaign. Case Studies: How Brands Are Using AI Influencers Although there is still no data about how effective AI influencers are compared to traditional influencers, it is clear that the fit with the product is still the most critical factor for a successful influencer marketing campaign. Audiences might be happy to see the innovation of AI influencers, but they may find human influencers more relatable regarding certain products. Still, AI influencers are great if brands want to showcase an innovative image and position themselves at the forefront of a trend. CreatorDB found three case studies in different industries to help you better understand how to work with AI influencers. 1. Hugo Boss Rebranding: Rebranding With Imma and Nobody Sausage In the spring of 2022, the German fashion brand Hugo Boss underwent a major rebranding effort to reach the younger generations. First of all, it was the campaign, which included many traditional fashion influencers such as Kendall Jenner and Hailey Bieber...."

A longtime collaborator of Dior's, the Mumbai-based studio is renowned for its work in preserving and teaching an array of craft techniques, as well as creating immersive installations based on artworks. Nearly three decades ago, Chanakya's artistic director, Karishma Swali, first connected with designer Maria Grazia Chiuri and has since worked with her artisans to create immersive textiles for the brand's fashion shows, replicating and accompanying art by Judy Chicago, Faith Ringgold, Isabella Ducrot, and more. Earlier this year for Dior's Spring/Summer 2025 haute couture collection, Chanakya and graduates from its nonprofit, Chanakya School of Craft, created a backdrop of large-scale textile panels titled “The Flowers We Grew,” imagined by artist Rithika Merchant. The show's interior atmosphere was enlivened by nine large-scale panels that hung from the walls, each representing Indian heritage and values special to Merchant. Mimicking the brushstrokes and chemical composition of the watercolor paintings, the hand-embroidered collaboration took 306 artisans 144,000 hours to execute.

a63034f9084bfe42fe33157e2bd79a69,2025-07-01 22:41:00,lv,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[lv]Ievads: Mūžīgās elegances triumfs Losandželosā Losandželosas koši sarkanā paklāja spožums reti kad atklāj patiesu modes revolūciju, tomēr aktrisei Umai Tūrmanei (Uma Thurman) tas izdevās ar pārsteidzošu vienkāršību un dziļu nozīmi. Filmas “The Old Guard 2” pirmizrādē, kas notika nesen, 2025. gada 25. jūnijā, Tūrmane neizvēlējās jaunu, tikko no podiuma nākušu tērpu, bet gan uzvilka teju trīs desmitgades vecu Prada kleitu no zīmola 1997. gada pavasara kolekcijas. Šī izvēle nebija tikai modes paziņojums; tā bija klusa, tomēr spēcīga manifestācija par mūžīgu stilu, ilgtspējību un personīgo identitāti, kas nepakļaujas ātrās modes mainīgajām vīzijām. Vēstījums sarkanajam paklājam: 28 gadus veca kleita ar jaunu elpu Kamēr citi vadošie aktieri, piemēram, Šarlīze Terona (Charlize Theron) un Kiki Leina (Kiki Layne), “The Old Guard 2” pirmizrādē demonstrēja mūsdienīgus dizaineru tērpus, Uma Tūrmane izcēlās ar savu pārdomāto un nostalģisko izvēli. Viņas tērps, kas sastāvēja no mandarīnu apkaklītes augšdaļas un zīda A veida svārkiem ar izsmalcinātu chinoiserie lapu žakarda motīvu, ne tikai piesaistīja uzmanību, bet arī iedarbināja plašāku diskusiju par modes vērtībām un patiesu eleganci. Lai gan daži interneta komentētāji sākumā apšaubīja tērpa piegulšanu vai krāsu, lielākā daļa vienojās, ka tas izstaro klasisku Umas Tūrmanes šarmu – līdzsvaru starp izsmalcinātību un relaksāciju, kas raksturīgs viņas stilam. Šī Prada kleita, precīzāk, tās iedvesma no 1997. gada pavasara kolekcijas, ir vairāk nekā tikai auduma gabals; tā ir gabals no modes vēstures, kas atdzīvināts jaunā kontekstā. Tā runā par apģērbu kā investīciju, nevis īslaicīgu kaprīzi, un apstiprina, ka patiesais stils ir nepakļāvīgs laika zobs. Aktrises izvēle vēl jo vairāk izceļas pašreizējā strauji mainīgajā modes ainā, kur katra jauna sezona atnes tūkstošiem jaunu tendenču un tērpu, radot milzīgu vides slogu. Tūrmanes rīcība ir kā svaiga gaisa malks, kas aicina apstāties un novērtēt to, kas jau pastāv un ir izturējis laika pārbaudi. Prada 1997. gada pavasara kolekcija: Miučijas Pradas sapnis un vīzija Lai pilnībā novērtētu Umas Tūrmanes izvēles nozīmi, ir jāiedziļinās Miučijas Pradas (Miuccia Prada) daiļrades kontekstā 1997. gadā. Toreizējā Prada pavasara/vasaras kolekcija bija iezīmēta ar izteiktu romantismu un sapņainību, atšķiroties no zīmola agrākajām, bieži vien stingrākajām neilona siluetēm. Šī kolekcija piedāvāja plandošas, caurspīdīgas kleitas ar delikātiem augu motīviem, kas apvienoja smalkumu un minimālismu ar smalku estētiku. Miučija Prada meklēja jaunu sievišķības izpausmi, attālinoties no tolaik valdošās ""modei neglītais"" tendences un pievēršoties kaut kam ēteriskākam un trauslākam. Kolekcijas raksturīgās iezīmes bija tieši šie chinoiserie motīvi – smalki zīda audumi, uz kuriem vijās izšuvumi vai apdrukas ar Āzijas iedvesmotiem lapu vai ziedu rakstiem. Šī estētika toreiz bija drosmīgs solis, jo Pradas reputācija balstījās uz intelektuālu, bieži vien askētisku pieeju, kas neizcēlās ar acīmredzamu glamūru. Taču tieši šajā kontrastā slēpās tās ģenialitāte: Miučija Prada spēja apvienot tradicionālo ar moderno, radot tērpus, kas bija vienlaikus gan eleganti, gan nedaudz neparasti. Umas Tūrmanes izvēlētā kleita, kas atspoguļo šīs kolekcijas dvēseli, bija un joprojām ir apliecinājums Pradas spējai radīt apģērbu, kas pārsniedz sezonālas tendences un kļūst par daļu no modes kanona. Umas Tūrmanes stils: Nepakļaušanās un pāri laika robežām Uma Tūrmane jau gadu desmitiem ir pazīstama ar savu izsmalcināto un bieži vien neparasto stila izjūtu. Viņa nekad nav bijusi akli sekojoša tendencēm, drīzāk radot savu, atpazīstamu elegances zīmolu. Viņas ilgstošās attiecības ar Prada modes namu sākās jau 90. gados, kad 1995. gada Oskara balvu ceremonijā viņa parādījās purpura Prada kleitā, nostiprinot savu statusu kā stila ikona. Tajā laikā Prada vēl nebija tik plaši atpazīstama kā šodien, un Tūrmanes izvēle bija drosmīga un negaidīta, iezīmējot zīmola ceļu uz starptautisku slavu un apliecinot aktrises izpratni par jaunām vīzijām modē. Gadu gaitā Tūrmane ir pierādījusi savu stilistisko daudzveidību, bez piepūles pārejot no romantiskām balles kleitām uz šikiem, piegrieztiem kostīmiem. Viņa izvēlas Eiropas dizainerus, piemēram, Versace un Dior, taču vienmēr saglabā savu unikālo identitāti. Viņas jaunākā izvēle – Prada kleita no 1997. gada – nav nejauša. Tā ir dziļi apzināta vēlme apliecināt vērtību laikam, meistarībai un stila ilgmūžībai. Tūrmane, kas pati ir kino ikona, ar savu tērpu it kā saka, ka patiesā vērtība slēpjas nevis jaunos apģērbos, bet gan spējā atdzīvināt un novērtēt to, kas jau ir sevi pierādījis kā izcilu. Vintage modes pieaugums: Aicinājums uz apzinātu patēriņu Umas Tūrmanes izvēle atspoguļo plašāku un arvien pieaugošu tendenci modes pasaulē: vintage apģērbu popularitāti uz sarkanā paklāja. Šī tendence, ko veicina tādi stilisti kā Lau Ročs (Law Roach) un tādas zvaigznes kā Zendaja (Zendaya) un Kendala Dženere (Kendall Jenner), ir kļuvusi par veidu, kā izcelties un paust nostāju. Tas nav tikai jauns modes kliedziens; tas ir daudzslāņains fenomens, ko virza vairāki būtiski faktori. Pirmkārt, tā ir alkas pēc individualitātes un unikalitātes. Ātrās modes laikmetā, kurā tūkstošiem cilvēku valkā līdzīgus apģērbus no masveida ražošanas, vintage piedāvā iespēju atrast patiesi oriģinālus, bieži vien ar rokām darinātus vai ierobežotās tirāžās radītus gabalus. Tie stāsta savu stāstu, nes sevī pagātnes atbalsis un ļauj to valkātājam justies īpašam. Otrkārt, tas ir spēcīgs solis ilgtspējības virzienā. Modes industrija ir viena no lielākajām piesārņotājām pasaulē, kas patērē milzīgus ūdens un enerģijas resursus, kā arī rada milzīgu atkritumu daudzumu. Izvēloties vintage, slavenības sūta skaidru vēstījumu par apzinātu patēriņu un resursu saglabāšanu. Tā ir atbilde uz augošo vides apziņu un vēlmi samazināt modes ekoloģisko pēdu. Atkārtoti izmantojot un novērtējot jau radīto, mēs veicinām aprites ekonomiku un samazinām pieprasījumu pēc jauniem, bieži vien neētiskos apstākļos ražotiem apģērbiem. Treškārt, vintage ir saistīts ar nostalģiju un vēstures novērtējumu. Šīs drēbes nav vienkārši “vecas”; tās ir archīva pērles, kas atspoguļo konkrētus periodus modes dizainā, kultūrā un sabiedrībā. Valkājot tās, slavenības ne tikai godina pagātnes dizainerus un meistarību, bet arī veido tiltu starp dažādiem modes laikmetiem, pierādot, ka patiesais skaistums ir pārejošs. Modes ietekme un zvaigžņu atbildība Zvaigžņu izvēlēm uz sarkanā paklāja ir milzīga ietekme uz globālajām modes tendencēm un patērētāju uzvedību. Kad tāda ikona kā Uma Tūrmane izvēlas vintage, tas nav tikai individuāls lēmums; tas ir publisks paziņojums, kas iedvesmo miljoniem cilvēku. Tas liek aizdomāties par ātrās modes ēnas pusēm – par tās ietekmi uz vidi, par strādnieku tiesībām, par pārmērīgu patēriņu...."

Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ. Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính. Nó là biểu tượng của một thách thức toàn cầu: khi hàng giả ngày càng tinh vi, thương mại điện tử ngày càng phát triển, và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng ngày càng dễ bị lợi dụng. Mỗi cú nhấp chuột mua hàng mà không kiểm chứng nguồn gốc có thể tiếp tay cho một đường dây tội phạm khổng lồ đang hoạt động ngay giữa lòng đô thị văn minh. Và mỗi vụ án được bóc trần – như đế chế hàng hiệu giả 1 tỷ đô ở Manhattan – là lời nhắc nhở rằng: cuộc chiến chống hàng giả chưa bao giờ đơn giản. Nguồn: Tổng hợp"

mov_526F65482D2F49C174109FD36A8CF269,2025-07-02 00:24:17,en,WEB,"  Remy Ma was involved in an intense verbal exchange on June 24 at a courthouse in Queens, New York, with the daughter of the man her son, Jayson “Jace” Scott, is accused of murdering. Vibe reported that the heated confrontation occurred on the steps of the courthouse, where 23-year-old Scott faces charges stemming from the 2021 death of 47-year-old Darius Guillebeaux. According to People magazine, Scott was arraigned in June 2024 on a seven-count indictment, including first and second-degree murder, reckless endangerment, and four counts of criminal possession of a weapon. What happened between Jazmin Dior and Remy Ma? The Shade Room posted a video Jazmin Dior shared of the dispute after she approached the Bronx rapper. In the clip, she accused Remy Ma of “trying to act tough” and told her to “go around the corner,” implying that she wanted to confront the 45-year-old physically without involving law enforcement. After Dior called her out, the “Conceited” artist appeared unfazed by her comments and responded, “Come on, beat me up,” as she walked down the steps and set her belongings down before the video ended. While there is no confirmation that the pair fought physically, a separate clip showed Remy Ma being handcuffed and escorted by police officers. As of now, the reason for her detention remains unknown. In a follow-up post, Dior candidly shared her side of the story, saying, “You would have thought I did something to you,” she said in the clip to Remy Ma, stating that the rapper did not appear to be remorseful over Scott's actions. “Realistically, I can never speak to my father again. You can see your son.” Dior also accused the MC of staring at her “with a whole attitude… as if her son was the victim. Like miss, where's your remorse?” she asked. Scott's alleged role in the 2021 murder case, explained Prosecutors allege that Scott was hired to kill Guillebeaux in Queens on June 7, 2021, and shot him multiple times, including after he had already fallen, AllHipHop and Blavity reported. Richard Swygert, 22, who is accused of conspiring with Scott, faces similar charges and is already imprisoned for a separate 2021 killing. After a probe into the incident, investigators arrested both Scott and Swygert on June 18, 2024, as they determined that they were both involved in the shooting based on surveillance and phone records. Remy Ma has supported her son through his legal issues Since then, Remy Ma has supported her son through his legal proceedings. At the time, a spokesperson for the rapper released a statement regarding the charges against Scott. “As many have heard, Remy Ma's son, Jayson Scott was recently arrested and very serious unfounded allegations have been made,” the statement read, per People. “Remy Ma wished to address this situation personally, but has been strongly advised by our office not to say anything publicly — as most people in this situation are, as the case is still active. To be clear, Jayson Scott is innocent and Remy Ma is committed to proving his innocence and fully supporting her child during this time.” If convicted, Scott faces life in prison without the possibility of parole."

Hundreds of people are gathering outside the Palladium every night to watch Rachel Zegler belt 'Don't Cry for me Argentina' from the theatre balcony for free, a fun PR stunt that is getting so popular it risks being shut down by the police, while the ticketholders, some paying upwards of £245 per seat, have to settle for watching the performance via video link. And on opening night, Keanu Reeves, Jessica Alba and Pedro Pascal were some of the A-Listers sat metres from me who gave multiple standing ovations in the first act – not at the end, but half an hour into the show. It's common to see British acting titans at West End opening nights, but this random collection of A-Listers who aren't particularly known for theatre showed how far beyond the West End landscape this production has travelled. How come? It's from Jamie Lloyd, the zeitgeisty producer behind 2023's Sunset Boulevard, the man who is basically reinventing what West End shows can look like, so anything he does generates buzz. It also stars Rachel Zegler, who was most famously racially abused for playing Snow White. Lloyd uses live video effects and radical aesthetics (think the lighting and set design from a Wembley Arena pop show) to make the point that theatre can be bigger, louder and more ambitious. But where Sunset Boulevard was more of a gentle character study, Evita is primarily a series of phenomenal ensemble numbers. Ultimately it feels more like a music concert than conventional piece of theatrical storytelling. As for Zegler, with the straying of an eye or the tilt of her head, she finds depth in the Argentinian leader's story, finding warmth, confidence and vulnerability in the tragic figure. Evita is inspired by the real-life story of Eva Peron, a working class Argentinian who married leader Juan Peron and died of cervical cancer aged 33. She is viewed as a contradictory figure because she helped establish workers' rights and paid leave, and got women the vote, but also became an early Champagne socialist; for some, her love for Christian Dior dresses and the finer things in life felt at odds with her stance about equality. The show runs at three hours but feels half that because it is stuffed with utterly incredible choreography and the litany of musical numbers, composed by Andrew Lloyd Webber. It's difficult to imagine that anything this stimulating has ever played in the West End before. And yet, I wasn't alone in finding Evita hard work. The outdated script introduces a range of historical characters without really putting them into context, or explaining their roles properly. The cast needs more space to tell the story with visual cues, but with barely any spoken lines – everything is delivered in verse as a rock opera – and a breakneck pace, the show is hard to follow for people who don't know the story well. I was relieved when, by the interval, multiple other journalists admitted to me they were finding the show hard to follow. It doesn't help that the production is also too loud, and when she sings Rachel Zegler's diction means she becomes difficult to understand. It's the same for the ensemble numbers: too often it's really difficult to catch what they're saying. It raises whole questions about accessibility, and the amount of knowledge audiences should come into shows with. Some critics will say cult musicals are designed for die-hard fans, but I tend to veer towards thinking shows should be able to be understood by newcomers. While this new production of Evita offers plenty of fresh thinking on the scope of the type of production values that are possible in these cranky, hundred-year-old theatres, I can't help but feel disappointed that so much of it went over my head. Evita plays at the London Palladium until September"

As more visitors bypass hotels for private villas, and government austerity drives kill meetings, there are better deals to be had for MICE, families, weddings and spa seekers.

You put your faith in the Gods as airport officials are hard to find and head through the scrum. The S-queues are neither clearly signposted nor explained, and the ""NO TIPPING"" video screens above immigration booths are the only indication of general direction. That is the light towards which the teeming masses shuffle. The green-lit automated immigration counters are for machine-readable passports only Others must queue. First fill out a health form using the QR code posted on a board as you approach immigration. Make sure your smartphone is charged and with mobile access and your passport/ticket details are at hand. You may have filled out and paid for an e-visa application for a VOA in advance and this saves time. You can also fill out a customs form in advance and keep the printout with QR code. This is to be presented after immigration. Your bags may or may not be x-rayed. Gusti Ngurah Rai International Airport is tropical modern and friendly, but maddeningly casual. Still, it's part of the teleporting fun. And you will miraculously get through. Just believe. Arriving passengers face monster traffic jams — especially in the Kuta-Seminyak-Canggu belt, central Ubud, North Uluwatu and at times, while passing Sanur — but a 12km toll road to Benoa and Nusa Dua and the underpass at the notorious Kuta circle offer some relief. The slobbering Alsatians who sniffed me in parts unseen since my mother demanded my underwear for the laundry, are less in evidence at hotel security. Brusque guards with mirrors attached to poles continue with their bored routine. More fun stuff for families and romantics from golf and dining to island hopping and black sand in our Bali Guide. Departure is wonderfully efficient. Lines move steadily through immigration and the ultra-modern security check. You may get through in record time to sample some colourful but expensive brand shopping from TUMI to Quicksilver, Longchamp and Marc Jacobs. Grab a burger and fries or sample a last taste of Indonesia at the rightly popular Made's Warung. If you care for a spot of duty free shopping at Bali Airport, a one litre bottle of 12-year-old Chivas mid-2025 was roughly US$45, a one litre Johnnie Walker Black US$56 (compared with $33 in Bangkok) and a 50ml EDP of Miss Dior's Blooming Bouquet US$122.

Check our Bali Map and dive in. On then with our Bali resorts review, spas and wellness escapes, and a look at new designer hotels that are pushing the envelope. Best of Nusa Dua hotels and conferences Nusa Dua in the far south is a safe and sanitised custom-built tourism enclave. The oldest resident here with mature gardens, statues, big pools, and a good spread of beach is the Nusa Dua Beach Hotel & Spa (www.nusaduahotel.com/) in the niorth of this enclave. At the friendly Palace Club, rooms start at 42sq m with gleaming herringbone wood parquet flooring, large flat-screen TV, a work desk and balcony. In 2016 the addition of the large and airy beachfront all-bamboo Tamarind Mediterranean Restaurant designed by late Indonesian icon Made Wijaya brightened things a tad. The hotel has two ballrooms for meetings and Bali conferences as well as open air event space packed with traditional artefacts and statues. Many pose for pre-wedding shots in white bridal finery at the stunning Candi Bentar that fronts the hotel. This is a traditional, slow paced, child-friendly hotel. It is close to the Bali Nusa Dua Convention Center. Close by, Kayumanis Nusa Dua (www.kayumanisnusadua.com, also in Ubud, Sanur and Jimbaran) offers a contemporary Bali luxury villa option. The villas are plush and smartly set out and have become more child-friendly though Ubud may not accommodate children below 12 years. Expect a rustic chic ambience, a soothing spa, and brisk service. Also in the vicinity are the villas and suites from Awarta (awartaresorts.com/), that took over in 2015 from the short-lived Centara Grand Villas Nusa Dua. Just to the north, Club Med Bali Resort (www.clubmed.com) is for people with French accents who like to use coloured beads for money...."

Mange flere vil følge efter i denne og næste uge, hvor den helt store charterferie uge indledes. De fleste tager den obligatoriske tur gennem lufthavnens taxfree butikker, for her er det jo billigt at købe en masse rare ting, som man kan forkæle sig selv eller andre med på ferien, eller nå.r man vender solbrændt hjem igen. Alene ordet ”taxfree” giver indtryk af, at varerne er billige at købe i lufthavnen – og danskerne har ” altid godt kunnet lide at spare penge. Københavns Lufthavn har lynende travlt her ved optakten til sommerferien. (Foto: Mads Aarmgaard / Københavns Lufthavn) De vil dog blive slemt skuffede, viser en ny analyse, som pris-sammenlignings-siden Pricerunner har foretaget i Københavns Lufthavn. Pricerunner har kigget på 20 populære varer og sammenlignet deres priser i lufthavnens taxfree med, hvad man kan købe dem for ude i det ”almindelige” Danmark. Analysen afslører, at 18 af de 20 varer er dyrere i lufthavnen. Køber man dem alle sammen, er prisen 1.488 kroner højere i lufthavnens taxfree. Ifølge Pricerunner kostede de 20 produkter i gennemsnit næsten 20 procent mindre uden for lufthavnen end inde i dens toldfri område. Solcreme er uundværlig for de fleste, når de tager på sommerferie nu. Tjek dog lige prisen i og uden for lufthavnen. (Foto: Natalia Blauth / Unsplash+) ”Mange af os griber automatisk ud efter taxfree varer i lufthavnen, fordi vi tænker, at de da er billigere. Det er helt forkert,” siger Brian Kjer Sommer. Han er forbruger analytiker hos Pricerunner. Sandheden er en helt anden, og hvis man kigger sig om efter de samme varer ude i butikkerne i Danmark kan man få dem langt billigere,” fortsætter han. En af de helt klassiske varer i rejsetasken er chokolade, og her er en 100 grams Toblerone næsten dobbelt så dyr i lufthavnens taxfree som hos den billigste forhandler uden for. De trendy LEGO blomster butikker som f.eks. LEGO Botanicals Mini-orkidé 10343 koster tilsvarende 34 procent mere i taxfree. Her er prisen 229 kroner, mens buketten kan fås for 170 kroner hos en forhandler ude i Danmark. Denne slags butikker ser man mange af i lufthavne. (Foto: Pexels / Pixabay) Make-up og parfume er traditionelt også meget populære som taxfree. Det kan man tydeligt se, fordi de er placeret længst fremme og ved indgangen i lufthavnens store supermarkeder. Tager vi f.eks. den velkendte herreduft Emporio Armani Stronger with You EdP 50 ml, skal man betale 649 kroner for den lille flaske i Københavns Lufthavns taxfree. Uden for lufthavnen kan den købes 172 kroner billigere. Her i sommer er solcreme naturligvis uundværlig, men køb den hellere, inden I tager i lufthavnen. Her er bl.a. Biotherm Lait Solaire Hydratsant SPF50 i 400 ml beholder 20,7 procent dyrere. ”Det er velkendt, at priser kan være højere på de mest besøgte ferie-destinationer. Færre er nok klar over, at taxfree på vej til rejsemålet også er meget dyrere,” forklarer Brian Kjer Sommer Toblerone chokolade hører til storsællerterne i lufthavnes taxfree, selvom det sjældent kan betale sig at købe dem dér. (Foto: Hans / Pixabay) ”Hvis man i forvejen ved, hvad man gerne vil købe på sin ferie, er det klogt at sammenligne priserne med de danske, inden man tager afsted,” fortsætter han. Kun to af de 20 varer, som Pricerunner tjekkede priserne på, var billigere i taxfree shoppen i Københavns Lufthavn. Det var en bøtte med 295 gram Lakrids by Bülw A The Original, som man kan spare en enkelt krone på. Bedre var det med Diors Addict Lip Tint No. 542 Natural Sienna lipgloss. Her var prisen 40 kroner lavere i Danmarks største lufthavn…. (Indledningsfoto til artiklen:  / Unsplash+) Her er den komplette liste over de pristjekkede varer.

Take yourself from bedtime ready to professional chic by layering a faux collar under a crewneck to look as if you've put on your official CEO uniform. Promising review: ""Love this collar, I wear crewnecks a lot and I wanted something to dress them up with. This def fits the bill!"" —Georgia W Get it from Amazon for $8.39+ (available in our colors and a two-pack). 2. Leave aerosol sprays and greasy roots in the past with I Dew Care dry shampoo. Just *tap, tap, tap* the little powderpuff where you need some oil control, and your 'do will look freshly-washed with the added perk of mega volume. Pro tip: Apply just a bit of product, brush it out, and repeat. Putting too much product at once may lead to a sheen of white residue. Promising review: ""I was looking for a dry shampoo that would be easy to use on the go for a trip I was taking. I had no issues taking this through TSA, and it was so easy to use on the go. You literally just pat the poof on your scalp and then rub the powder in. I do have black hair, so dry shampoo is usually very visible in my hair, but I didn't have any harder time than usual rubbing this powder in. It did a really good job of soaking up all the oil and giving my hair volume. I'm not a fan of the price for the amount that you get, but it is lasting longer than I thought it would. I would definitely recommend and will purchase again."" —Teresa Get it from Amazon for $9.99+ (available in seven shades). 3. Upgrade your casual-just-getting-a-coffee wardrobe with an elevated cropped tank, one that has been blessed by a stylish fairy godmother. Why? This takes your basic cami and goes *poof. * Promising review: ""Don't hesitate, just buy it. I bought it in one color and as soon as I tried it on I purchased three more. The material is like butter. It doesn't have a built-in bra, but it's lined. You could put on a bra with this if you'd like but there's no need. It's cropped but still long enough that it doesn't roll up weirdly at the bottom. Can dress this up or down! I'll probably end up buying every color by the end of the year, it's just that incredible."" —Danijtate Get it from Amazon for $14.99+ (available in women's sizes S–XXL and 31 colors). 4. Trade your pajamas for an equally comfy (and errand-appropriate) lounge set. This one is made with a cozy waffle-knit material, ironic considering you'll adore this two-piece just as much as the doughy, syrup-drenched breakfast dessert. Promising review: ""I really like the fabric of this one and it's perfect for fall and winter in Texas. I love being comfy and still looking somewhat put together in this."" —Lily McAninch Get it from Amazon for $45.99+ (available in women's sizes S–XL and in 17 colors). 5. Pair a plain tee with high-waisted palazzo trousers, pants guaranteed to make you feel ~trendier than thou~ while you strut to your corner deli. These are available in neutral and vibrant hues alike, making it look as if you didn't snooze through your alarm this morning. Promising review: ""These pants as so comfortable and flowy! I stepped outside of my usual skinny jean outfit to try this style and I never want to take them off! They are great casual pants for work, and can be dressed up for the evening with a fancy shirt and heels. They are as comfortable as pajamas, without looking like it :)"" —Nash..."

Wir verraten dir, welche sechs Sommerdüfte aktuell beliebt sind und sich auf jeder Wunschliste wiederfinden sollten. #1 „Nivea Creme“ von Nivea Mit dem Duft „Nivea Creme“ gibt es die klassische und beliebte Nivea Creme auch als Eau de Toilette.

Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #3 „Boss The Scent“ von Hugo Boss „Boss The Scent“ von Hugo Boss ist ein Parfum für die facettenreiche Frau. Der im Jahr 2016 lancierte Duft ist das Gegenstück zum gleichnamigen Herrenparfum und seither für seine sinnliche und verführerische Wirkung beliebt. Raffiniert und feminin in seiner Komposition, ist er eine Hommage an die selbstsichere und elegante Frau und vereint geschickt saftigen Pfirsich mit blumiger Osmanthusblüte. Abschließend bildet sinnlicher, weißer Moschus eine subtile, aber hinreißende Duftnuance, welche das Eau de Parfum zu einem Must-have der Saison macht. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon.

Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. #6 „Light Blue“ von Dolce & Gabbana Unser last but not the least: „Light Blue“ von Dolce & Gabbana ist eine moderne Interpretation des klassischen Zitronenduftes. Das Eau de Toilette entführt dich an das belebende Mittelmeer und entfaltet ein leichtes und entspanntes Lebensgefühl. Dabei vereint es einen spannenden Cocktail aus fruchtigen, zitrischen und holzig-pudrigen Duftakkorden, welche den Duft der mediterranen Amalfiküste einfangen. Der elegante Flakon rundet das Erlebnis ab. Hier bekommst du den Duft bei Amazon. Lust auf sinnlich florale Düfte bekommen?

Peach Slices Redness Relief Color Correcting Cream for those days when your skin seems to be pitching a fit about something or another. This not only provides soothing, moisturizing ingredients like aloe and green algae, but it also has a subtle color-correcting tint that tones down redness. Think of it as a little tube of damage control for when your skin needs extra TLC. Promising review: ""I'm not one to normally leave reviews, but this is worth it. I've literally had this product for two days. I have severe rosacea on my nose. It's so bad I usually have to wear foundation to hide it because it's so noticeable. I've tried numerous products and serums with no luck, and honestly, I didn't expect this one to be any different. However, after only two days (probably applying it 4–5 times), almost all of the redness is gone! I'm in disbelief at the wonders it has done. I will without a doubt be stocking up on this product!"" —Tiffany Price: $19.88 2. Neutrogena Collagen Bank Facial Moisturizer that's basically an investment in your future face. Collagen helps keep things pinchably plump, bouncy, and glowy, which is great. But the real power player in this cream is the bakuchiol — an active ingredient which can boost cell turnover and smooth skin texture — which is basically retinol's less dramatic cousin. No joke, this study suggests that bakuchiol is just as effective as retinol while being way less likely to cause irritation. So basically, you get all the glow with none of the drama. It's a win-win. Promising review: ""The Neutrogena Collagen Bank moisturizer is making my skin feel smoother. It does not irritate my skin, and I really like the dispenser. I plan to keep using it."" —Serendipity Price: $19.97 (originally $22.97) 3. Sol de Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream because your skincare routine doesn't stop at your neck. It smells like summer vacation in a tub — think vanilla, salted caramel, and pistachio — and the fast-absorbing formula is infused with caffeine-rich guarana extract to visibly smooth and tighten. Your group chat will be demanding a scent rundown. Promising review: ""My skin is usually sensitive to anything with fragrances, this on the other hand, is perfect. It leaves my skin soft, and the fragrance ISN'T overpowering like other products. I would say over the span of a week or so I noticed a drastic improvement in my skin!"" —anonymous Price: $19.99+ (available in two sizes) 4. Aquaphor Lip Repair Ointment to rescue your lips when they feel like they've survived a beating. With a powerhouse blend of shea butter, beeswax, vitamin E, and chamomile, this ultra-soothing balm helps restore moisture, calms irritation, and keeps flakes at bay. Stop peeling and start slathering. Promising review: ""This product is highly recommended for maintaining moisture or replenishing moisture to chapped lips. I have sold lip conditioners that were 20 bucks. No need to pay that much money. Use this!"" —Tina Price: $8.36 for two 5. Or NYX Professional Makeup Fat Oil for a hydration boost that also gives your lips a juicy shine. With lots of moisturizing and antioxidant-rich ingredients, this lip oil is protective, long-lasting, and nonsticky. The gorg hint of color and lovely scent are just icing on the cake...."

Email tips@dailymail.com Rihanna proudly displayed her bare baby bump on Wednesday, as she arrived at the Royal Monceau Hotel in Paris with her youngest son Riot by her side. The music superstar, 37, is currently pregnant with her third child with rapper boyfriend A$AP Rocky, with the couple already parents to sons RZA, three, and Riot, 23 months. She announced her exciting baby news in typically dramatic form, revealing her blossoming bump at May's Met Gala, where A$AP served one of the co-chairs. This week saw Rihanna enjoying a rare public outing with little Riot in the French capital, before the mother-and-son duo returned to their hotel. The hitmaker bared her growing bump in a cropped polo shirt teamed with a pair of very oversized cargo pants, and ballerina flats. While she toted the newly redesigned Book Tote from Dior, based on the first edition cover of Dracula by Bram Stoker. Doting on her youngest child, Rihanna beamed as she held tightly onto Riot's hand, while the adorable tot didn't hide his annoyance at the surrounding cameras. Her latest outing comes just days after boyfriend A$AP appeared to accidentally let slip the gender of their unborn child. The rapper was asked if the couple were set to have daughter after previously welcoming two boys, while attending the world premiere of Rihanna's new film, Smurfs, in Brussels on Sunday. On the blue carpet, Entertainment Tonight asked: 'Is that the girl you've been waiting for', A$AP immediately confirming: 'It is, man, it is.' The Everyday chart-topper - whose real name is Rakim Athelaston Mayers - then held up a plush Smurfette doll and added: 'Right here, you know what I'm saying? Right here.' But in response to the same question, Rihanna merely smiled coyly and replied: 'Let's see if it's a Smurfette...It could be a Papa Smurf. Who knows?' However, the singer did confirm that the couple would give their next child a name that begins with R, like their first two, adding: 'That's the one thing me and Rocky don't fight over.' When asked how many more children they planned on having, A$AP joked: 'We [are] going to be like the Wayans' family, you know? Yeah, I mean, love is beautiful and it's just [about] spreading it.' The power couple - who share matching 1988 tattoos to mark their birth year - originally met in 2011 when Rihanna first enlisted A$AP to rap on her song Cockiness (Love It). While they were romantically linked in 2013, after he after opened up for her Diamonds World Tour, they first confirmed their relationship in May 2021, when A$AP told GQ Rihanna was 'the love of my life'. Rihanna both produced and starred in Paramount Animation's Smurfs, playing the voice role of Smurfette - along with writing and recording original songs like Friend Of Mine. Smurfette was previously voiced by the billionaire's rival pop stars Katy Perry and Demi Lovato. Chris Miller's animated film will also feature Nick Offerman, Natasha Lyonne, JP Karliak, Dan Levy, Amy Sedaris, Nick Kroll, James Corden, Octavia Spencer, Hannah Waddingham, Sandra Oh, Alex Winter, Billie Lourd, Xolo Maridueña, Kurt Russell, and John Goodman. A$AP also took on an acting role as Yung Felony in Spike Lee's critically-acclaimed neo-noir crime thriller Highest 2 Lowest, which hits US theaters August 22 before streaming on Apple TV+ starting September 5. But there is still no release date for the New York native's long-delayed fourth studio album, Don't Be Dumb."

788194AC4F6EE38BAA09391FD01E85A6,2025-07-02 08:15:45,en,PRINT,"  In a 49-page lawsuit filed in California, Lululemon accused the retail wholesaler of selling knockoff versions of its Scuba clothing and popular ABC men's pants. For nearly as long as mankind has worn fancy things, someone out there has been trying to copy those things. Ancient artisans cribbed from each other's designs. Victorian hustlers duped diamond jewelry with shimmery paste. Christian Dior, the godfather of high fashion himself, was believed to sell his own designs to lesser known producers, who could make cheaper versions. For the modern athleisure giant Lululemon, however, the duping has gone too far. In a lawsuit filed in California on June 25, the company accused the wholesale retailer Costco of selling knockoff sweatshirts, jackets and other activewear at a fraction of what Lululemon charges. Successfully suing over knockoffs is notoriously difficult for fashion brands and designers, in part because copyright laws are often vague, experts say. Lululemon's case seeks restitution and payment from Costco, which it said profited off Lululemon's ''sweat equity'' and damaged the Lululemon brand. Costco did not immediately respond to a request for comment. What is Lululemon accusing Costco of doing? Lululemon said Costco is selling knockoffs of its Scuba hoodies and sweatshirts, Define jackets and popular ABC pants for men. Using design images and side-by-side comparisons, Lululemon, in a 49-page court filing, argued that Costco sold jackets and hoodies -- made by clothing manufacturers such as Danskin, Spyder and Jockey -- using terms in its marketing similar to what Lululemon uses. In one instance cited in the lawsuit, Costco sold a turquoise Danskin-made pullover -- which at a glance looks remarkably similar to Lululemon's Scuba sweatshirt -- with the color ''Tidewater Teal.'' It's the same way Lululemon describes the color of its own teal sweatshirts. Lululemon also accuses Costco of manufacturing a knockoff of its ABC pants -- which retail for about $130 -- under Costco's own brand, Kirkland, and selling them for $20. Contracts between vendors like Danskin and Jockey and retailers like Costco often include provisions like indemnification clauses, which can specify that vendors bear financial responsibility for legal issues that could arise from their products. It's unclear whether such clauses exist in this case. How has Lululemon dealt with dupes? Lululemon, with its unadorned styles and high prices, is famously a target for knockoffs. Hashtags on TikTok direct shoppers to cheap, duped versions of the brand's leggings and athletic wear. Since Lululemon's inception in Canada in 1998, fashion law experts in America say that the brand has been on the forefront of design trademark law, which is famously lax in the United States as compared to other markets, like Europe. ''They absolutely have been on the forefront of trying to find ways to protect their intellectual property,'' said Susan Scafidi, the founder and director of the Fashion Law Institute at the Fordham School of Law. Protecting trademarks, logos and labels is one thing. Protecting the design of a garment is another.'' ''In Europe that's easy. Design rights, done,'' said Ms. Scafidi. '' In the U.S., well in Lululemon terms, they have to warm up and stretch.'' Still, dupes are enough of a concern that Lululemon held several ''dupe'' exchanges in 2023, offering holders of confirmed ''dupe'' leggings to bring their clothes to designated sites and trade them for the real thing. At the time, Nikki Neuburger, Lululemon's chief branding officer, said it was an effort to acknowledge ''dupes'' as part of fashion while protecting the original producer. ''We saw it as a really fun way to play into something that is a real part of our culture, but in a way that really puts the focus back on the original,'' Ms. Neuburger told CNN. What is 'dupe' culture? Many millennials probably recall a school or family trip to New York City in the 2000s, when a coveted status symbol of adolescence was a pair of sunglasses or a candy-colored knockoff designer purse, bought after haggling with a vendor on Canal Street. But today's dupe market has gone digital, and TikTok has become a prime platform. Videos with the ''dupe'' hashtag have billions of views on the platform. For many in Gen Z, good dupes have become almost as coveted as originals. Many influencers promote knockoffs of Stanley mugs, Lululemon pants, sneakers and designer jewelry. ''Dupes are not only out there in the open, they are a point of pride. These are the modern versions of being an extreme coupon clipper or a bargain hunter, and it has lost a lot of its shame,'' Ms. Scafidi said. But designers are increasingly trying to stamp out knockoffs, and take back brands' power. In November 2024, Sol de Janeiro sued over dupes of its popular scented mist sprays. The year before that, Deckers, which owns the Ugg boot brand, sued over dupes of its ankle shearling boot. This May, Deckers sued Costco over the same thing, claiming the retailer's far cheaper Shearling slippers were a direct copy of the UGG equivalent. If the Lululemon suit succeeds, Ms. Scafidi said, it could rewind some of that clock, making original designer versions once again palatable. ''Lulu is trying to buy back some of that territory,'' Ms. Scafidi said. If they win, ''that will be a huge social victory.''"

18141980230401578,2025-07-02 10:33:36,en,INSTAGRAM,"  I just created two completely different Dior campaigns in under 30 minutes. Same product. Completely different audiences. One feels like your best friend showing you their favorite find. The other? High-end magazine spread. Here's what most people miss about AI product photography: It's not about replacing one expensive shoot. It's about replacing hundreds of them. Every e-commerce brand drowns in content demands: Daily posts. Email campaigns. Seasonal refreshes. Different demographics. Different platforms. Different moods. Traditional approach? $5K per shoot. Maybe 30 images. Brands need 300+ monthly to feed their content machine. Plus they're stuck with whatever they shot. Same lighting. Same mood. Same concept. AI lets you create unlimited unique variations. Different worlds. Different aesthetics. Different impossible scenarios. The math doesn't work with traditional shoots. They're either hemorrhaging money on constant shoots or recycling stale images. That's why this skill is pure gold. Problem is as most of you know, AI tools suck at product photography. ChatGPT warps products. Midjourney gets details wrong. But I've developed a method that works consistently. Brands can't tell what's real anymore. Whether you're freelancing or training teams - this skill pays premium. My complete system launches module one on July 6th. Images, video, consistency, client acquisition - everything. Pre-sale available now. Massive discount. Payment plans included.

The dismembered remains of 19-year-old Venezuelan TikTok influencer Fabiola Alejandra Caicedo Pina, popularly known online as""China Baby,"" were found clogging the filtration grid of a water treatment plant in the city, according to the New York Post report. Also Read | American influencer gets impressed by India's jugaad culture The body parts were first discovered on June 9, just days after Pina posted her last video on TikTok to her 5,000 followers. Forensic teams identified her remains through several distinctive tattoos, including one on her back that read""Paula Sophia"" along with a date. Some of her body parts remain missing, according to reports by Panamericana and Infobae. ""She never told us she was leaving. She just left, and that was it,"" a relative told La Republica , highlighting the family's shock and grief over her disappearance and tragic end. Also Read | Vegetarian influencer rants about not having enough options; social media reacts According to Infobae, Pina had left her home country of Venezuela as a minor to live in Peru with her then-boyfriend, Meiner Jimenez Castillo. In 2022, Castillo died by suicide in Lima. However, his family had allegedly harassed Pina online, accusing her of being connected to his death - claims that were never substantiated. The Peruvian National Police have described the brutality of Pina's murder as being consistent with methods used by human trafficking networks, and they are exploring that angle as part of their investigation. So far, no suspects have been formally named or arrested in connection with the case.

mov_0E38685FDFA51F6B7EF2BBA08A8C5A74,2025-07-02 12:25:47,en,WEB,"  Paris Men's Fashion Week 2025 arrived with a quiet confidence. This summer season is defined less by spectacle and more by nuance. From Pharrell's global diplomacy at Louis Vuitton to Jonathan Anderson's subtle reimagining of Dior heritage, the collections echoed a world in motion yet craving calm. Craftsmanship met technology, tradition bowed to innovation, and desire found expression in restraint. This was a moment of elegance and thoughtful reinvention — the kind of fashion that invites reflection and adventure. Here's KHAMSA's roundup of the names that shaped the week. ١. LOUIS VUITTON – Le Monde est à Vous [embedded content] For his third collection at Louis Vuitton, Pharrell Williams staged a show on the rooftop of UNESCO in Paris, where diplomacy met design. A Damier-printed runway designed in collaboration with Bijoy Jain of Studio Mumbai. The collaboration set the tone for a cross-cultural vision that paid tribute to India's dress codes and craftsmanship. Dubbed “Le Monde est à Vous” (The World is Yours), the collection fused tailored safari silhouettes, cricket jerseys, and a new “damoflage” print in a palette of earthy saffron, khaki, and ivory. Embellished trunks, turbans, and luxe monogrammed cargos signaled a shift toward ornate utility. With live music by AR Rahman and Native Voices of Resistance, the show underscored Vuitton's message: global elegance grounded in heritage, movement, and meaning. ٢. DIOR – Jonathan Anderson's Debut Courtesy of Dior Courtesy of Dior Courtesy of Dior At the Hôtel des Invalides, Dior marked a new chapter as Jonathan Anderson unveiled his first menswear collection for the house. The designer, known for his sculptural work at JW Anderson and Loewe, brought a fresh irreverence to Dior's legacy, stripping back the theatricality of past seasons. Silhouettes nodded to the maison's archives — most notably the Bar jacket, here oversized and re-gendered — while loose cargo pants echoed couture gowns from the 1940s. The collection's quiet provocation lay in its restraint: historical references warped into modern utility, florals stitched as whispers, and tailoring that blurred between dressing up and dressing down. Set within a space modeled on Berlin's Gemäldegalerie, Anderson's debut redefined heritage as a structure to twist, not preserve. ٣. HERMÈS – Summer in the City Courtesy of Hermès Courtesy of Hermès At Hermès, Véronique Nichanian offered a study in air, light, and ease. The collection unfolded like a deep breath — technical yet sensual, refined yet grounded. Openwork leather traced clean lines across blousons and trousers, while a muted palette of putty, caramel, and mint gave way to richer tones like burgundy and vanilla. Shapes were fluid but never loose: shirt-jackets, cropped trousers, and soft parkas constructed with the precision of saddlery, but made to move. There was no spectacle here — only the subtle poetry of craftsmanship. This was summer not as a season, but as a texture: breathable, tactile, and wholly at peace with itself. Courtesy of Hermès ٤. SAINT LAURENT – Clinamen Courtesy of Saint Laurent Courtesy of Saint Laurent Courtesy of Saint Laurent Anthony Vaccarello's latest menswear show unfolded under dry afternoon light at the Bourse de Commerce, where stillness replaced spectacle. Inspired by a generation of artists who turned desire into form — and by Yves Saint Laurent's own 1974 retreat — the collection explored elegance through restraint. Waists were cinched, shoulders extended, and fabrics like silk and nylon floated close to the body without clinging. The palette, hushed and coastal, echoed sand, salt, and pale ochre. At the center of the space, porcelain bowls drifted in a circular basin — the Clinamen installation by Céleste Boursier-Mougenot — producing quiet collisions that mirrored the show's mood. There were no grand gestures, only presence, held with intent. Courtesy of Saint Laurent ٥. KENZO – Club Kenzo..."

The documentary premiered on 27th June at Mandarin Oriental, Hong Kong and is available on Prime Video, Canal+ and Tencent worldwide, offering viewers an exclusive glimpse into the meticulous orchestration behind three extraordinary events hosted across Europe and Asia. Inside The Dream captures the essence of Mandarin Oriental's guest-centric philosophy, where service excellence is crafted not only in moments of splendour but also in the countless hours of preparation behind the scenes. Across three destinations and through the eyes of passionate colleagues, the film reveals the challenges, creativity and collaborative spirit that shape special experiences. At Mandarin Oriental, we are masters of our craft. Inside The Dream honours the dedication of our colleagues, who consistently deliver extraordinary moments with grace, precision and a deep sense of purpose. This film is a tribute to their expertise and to the immersive experiences that define our brand. Laurent Kleitman, Group Chief Executive of Mandarin Oriental The title pays homage to a concept first explored by iconic brands including Bvlgari, Mugler and Dior, reimagined here through the lens of luxury hospitality to reflect Mandarin Oriental's own journey of craftsmanship, storytelling and service excellence. Produced with a cinematic lens that mirrors the sophistication and narrative depth of luxury filmmaking, Inside The Dream reflects Mandarin Oriental's commitment to storytelling as a means of connecting with today's modern traveller. Each episode of Inside The Dream is an invitation to step behind the scenes of a legendary house to reveal the passion, talent and quiet excellence that make the world dream. Dedicating an episode to hospitality was always a natural choice. This universe shares the same sense of precision, beauty and emotion as haute couture or fine watchmaking. It's been a true honour to collaborate with Mandarin Oriental and celebrate the people who make its soul, joining our series with the same dedication to excellence. Claude Lacaze, CEO of Terminal 9 Studios As Mandarin Oriental continues to shape the future of hospitality through innovation, heritage and considerate expansion, Inside The Dream invites global audiences to witness the beauty of collective excellence, a celebration of hospitality, talent and legendary service.

I thought it was beautiful, and also super wearable/marketable, but I was surprised to see so much negativity in the comments. The main critiques were that it was too expensive (FAIR), that it looked too much like Loewe, or people were just being annoying and saying things like “I wish John Galliano was at Dior again.” Second: I this analysis by scraping around 2,100 comments using an APIFY Instagram comment scraper, imported everything into R, and filtered it down to around 800 comments that were longer than 30 characters (so there was actually some substance, not just emojis). Then I ran a basic sentiment analysis to label each comment as positive, negative, or neutral and get a breakdown of the percentages. After that, I used a simple word-counting function to identify the most common words and bigrams, and looked at how often they showed up in positive vs. negative comments to understand the main topics in each. #fashiondata #fashiontrends #dior #jwanderson"

Prada 2026春夏男裝大秀於Prada藝術基金會之 Deposito內舉行，會場用花花地毯布置成簡單而夢幻的空間，本季聚焦「A CHANGE OF TONE態度的轉變」，兩位創意總監 Miuccia Prada 與 Raf Simons 希望轉換現實社會權力至上的風氣，嘗試用真誠、美好的事物回歸純粹。 當天與會嘉賓中的男士們一一以敞開的西裝造型亮相，博得粉絲們大大歡心，而最新2026春夏系列大量的小短褲Looks，更讓人期待下回會由哪位明星來駕馭呢？ Prada 2026春夏男裝系列從繽紛色彩，到單品的選擇如編織帽、拖鞋、短褲，都是非常夏日的畫面，同時也強調穿衣是從容自在的態度，在有些你可能不解為何這樣搭配的Looks裡，正是用「非典型和諧」來象徵自由。 Dolce&Gabbana
Dolce&Gabbana 2026春夏男裝系列主題定為「PAJAMAS BOY睡衣男孩」，經典的條紋睡衣成為設計主軸，輕盈棉料、皺皺質感、鬆緊抽繩⋯⋯都是回家後讓人想立刻換上的居家服特質！ 其中當然也少不了品牌的豹紋元素點綴，工藝則體現在閃閃發亮的寶石和水晶刺繡上。 Dolce&Gabbana本季的主題其實是想傳遞一個概念，那便是模糊居家與外出的界線，保持輕鬆自在的態度，睡衣也可以是很時髦的日常造型！ 在秀後，模特兒們更是直接穿著這些睡衣Looks走上街頭，呼應本季的訴求，這個精彩的環節馬上就形成話題！ Vivienne Westwood
這是繼2017年Vivienne Westwood首度在米蘭發表獨立男裝系列後，睽違8年的回歸舞台。 由Andreas Kronthaler主導的最新2026春夏男裝系列，我們看到男人們穿起高跟鞋（而且有些超級高！） 、連衣裙⋯⋯性別邊界已被模糊。 VivienneWestwood 2026春夏帶領觀眾回到文藝復興時期，當時英國貴族公子們嚮往到地中海「壯遊」，因此他們的風格受到了義式渲染。 而Andreas Kronthaler強調服裝不分性別，他便把花花公子的Dandy Style夏日風格，與老奶奶衣櫥中會有元素混合在一起，例如復古印花、軟軟材質的裙子、便鞋……每一套都令人眼睛發亮！ 「當一位男士擁有風格，這便足夠了。 風格與時尚無關，真正重要的是態度與品味的展現。」 PDF
來自米蘭的新銳品牌 PDF自創立以來就以顛覆傳統的風格備受矚目，2026春夏系列秀場佈置成一個監獄空間，鐵鍊、欄杆、反光鏡面裝置……瞬間拉開逃脫計畫的序幕，則猶如一場「越獄風雲」！ dunhill
創意總監Simon Holloway為dunhill 2026春夏系列提供了破格的上流社會著裝靈感，以玩世不恭的姿態演繹正裝風格，讓優雅紳士不再呆板，頂級英倫式剪裁輪廓中，運用大膽的色彩組合、加入運動氣息、瀟灑的著衣方式，來演繹這種衝突感美學，參與走秀的漂亮狗狗們也是一個可愛亮點，同時代表著一種貴族氣息的象徵。 延伸閱讀：

mov_40D9ED93ACFBB2479F426AE4E07D0E73,2025-07-02 17:18:55,en,WEB,"  It's rare for a West End theatre production to garner so much attention and excitement before opening night, yet that is exactly what Rachel Zegler has managed to do as she steps into the shoes of Eva Perón in director Jamie Lloyd's daring take on the beloved musical, Evita. Over the last two weeks of preview shows, Zegler has stepped out on to the balcony of The London Palladium, the musical's new home, mid-performance to perform a powerful rendition of 'Don't Cry For Me, Argentina'. ' I don't think any of us expected it to garner as much attention as it did,' the 24-year-old actor reflects to ELLE UK, the morning after Evita's opening night. 'People have been camping out for hours before I go on and it's humbling, beautiful and fits in the story very well.' Starring as Perón, Zegler has received rave reviews for her passionate, high-voltage performance which follows the life of the Argentine political leader Juan Perón, and his second wife. The dynamic show, set to Andrew Lloyd Webber's soaring score, dominated social media during its preview period and has now officially opened its doors to London audiences. Pedro Pascal, Sarah Paulson and Keanu Reeves were among the high-profile guests at the Palladium on opening night to see Zegler belt out beloved ballads like 'Rainbow High' and 'A New Argentina'. 'Sarah texted me last week asking for the link to get tickets. I had no idea she meant last night,' Zegler exclaims. ' Then, our ensemble member Harrison Wilde asked me backstage, ""Rachel, is Pedro here? "" and I said he probably would have told me. Then, during 'Rainbow High', I saw Pedro stand up. I was like, ""Dad, you're embarrassing me! ""' she jokes. ' No, he was so sweet. Keanu Reeves was there, too. I was freaking out!' For the occasion, Zegler wore a SS25 beige tulle Haute Couture Dior ballgown adorned with bejewelled bows, designed by the house's recently departed creative director, Maria Grazia Chiuri. On her look, Zegler worked closely with her long-time stylist Sarah Tooley to pay a visual tribute to her character's legacy. ' It was so evident to Sarah and I that Dior had to be a part of the night because of the lyrics of 'Rainbow High' being ""Christian Dior me from my head to my toes "",' she shares. 'Christian Dior was such an influence on Eva's fashion in real life, so we wanted to pay homage and have classic elements as well as the modern, diva and Madonna-esque version of Eva. That's why this design was so perfect.' Having worked with her since the start of Zegler's acting career, Tooley is a stylist she truly trusts. ' She knows my taste, but she also knows my body and what I'll feel comfortable in. That's a testament to the friendship and trust [we've] built,' Zegler reflects. Her look was finished with fine jewellery from London-based brands Ananya and David Morris, a fresh, glossy make-up look and her signature soft waves on the hair, styled by Valeria Ferreira and Dayaruci respectively. ' I want to look like myself as much as possible, so I can be myself in a professional sphere where a lot of pressure is on,' Zegler says of her glam approach. The opening night of Evita followed two weeks of preview shows, in which the production is tweaked nightly before it officially opens. ' That is both exhilarating and exhausting for an ensemble group of people, so it was such a wonderful experience to lock it and get the response we've had so far,' Zegler reflects. Still, one thing has remained consistent – the unprecedented reaction to the electric moment she leaves the stage and heads to the the theatre's balcony for the musical's most beloved number. 'It's brilliant,' Zegler says of the scene. ' The second Jamie said that's what he was trying to get permission from Westminster Council to do, I said ""We need to do anything to make that possibility real. "" But, as simple as it may seem, it's a huge production as there are a lot of technology and hard work involved to show the theatre inside the Palladium.' Zegler shares that audiences inside applaud nightly when they see the amount of people waiting outside as it's 'such a ridiculously impressive thing to pull off.' 'When we first performed it, it was just me in a robe and my wig to figure out the lighting and sound for the show. The odd person would stop and take a picture, but the next day, it was 100 people, then 20o and it would double in size. It's overwhelming but really moving.' As for the critics, Zegler states there's deeper meaning behind the spectacle. ' It's a testament to the fact that this show is based on history,' Zegler continues. ' Eva was a real person and there is no world in which she would want to impress people who could afford to see a show at a theatre. She wanted to bring her message to the streets and to the people. Jamie integrates the modern ingenuity of theatre by respecting the source material in such a way that serves such a beautiful purpose.' It's clear playing this role means a lot to Zegler. ' It's a dream come true. I haven't been on stage in a musical since high school [for Shrek The Musical, famously] and I missed it so much... When you get to live your dream, you don't take any second for granted and I'm not, I'm soaking in every second...."

mov_3E7B54EBFBCE404FE724C963D393B0EC,2025-07-02 17:38:00,en,WEB,"  The Starboard Group is seizing the moment. With the cruise industry experiencing a sustained rebound post-COVID-19, the Starboard Group, operator of boutiques aboard cruise liners and super yachts, has been rolling out new product initiatives and services ranging from personalizing jewelry and ear piercings, to tequila developed with the Invicta Watch Group. More from WWD Starboard also plans to launch a natural diamond program this fall, details of which will be revealed later this summer. “Cruising has never been more popular,” said Caryl Capeci, Starboard's senior vice president of fine jewelry and Swiss watches. “There was a stoppage of the cruise ships during COVID-19, and then it all came back. We've seen not only the number of passengers but also retail sales on cruise ships grow and grow and grow. And in June, we had record high sales volume.” During an interview Tuesday, Capeci cited statistics indicating the cruise industry is forecast to carry 37 million passengers in 2025, up from approximately 34.6 million last year, with expectations to reach 42 million by 2028. So an opportunity to capture greater wallet share from more passengers on board cruise ships exists. Last year, Starboard cruise line shops generated an estimated $800 million to under $1 billion, according to sources. Capeci declined to confirm the figure though she characterized Starboard's 2024 volume as in the hundreds of millions of dollars. Starboard works with 14 cruise lines, including Royal Caribbean, Virgin Voyages and Carnival Cruise Line, and more than 95 different cruise ships selling everything from beauty, fragrance and liquor to apparel, Swiss watches and fine and fashion jewelry. Through its cruise and luxury division, Starboard operates single-brand shops, as well as multibrand shops on ships. Among the brand shops are Omega, Brietling, Tag Heuer, Bulgari, Hublot, Cartier, IWC, Panerai, Piaget, Messika, Swarovski and Pandora. Also sold are beauty brands such as Dior, Chanel, Lancome, Clinique, Estée Lauder, Clarins and La Mer. Shops range from 100 to 750 square feet. The merchandise in the Starboard shops is duty free and tax free. Among the initiatives Capeci cited: Boutiques for Cartier, IWC Schaffhausen and Piaget aboard Luminara, the newest super yacht in The Ritz-Carlton Yacht Collection, which was launched this week. The boutiques offer Swiss timepieces, fine jewelry and accessories, as well as private viewings, in-suite appointments and sessions with brand ambassadors to explore the craftsmanship and heritage of the brands. Also on offer are designer jewelry, luxury accessories and resortwear — from vintage Hermès bags and Stella McCartney handbags to fine jewelry by Ileana Makri, Lauren Rubinski and Sydney Evan. Ear piercing in partnership with Inverness, the ear piercing system, has been set up on 33 ships across multiple cruise lines in the past couple of months. Starboard says “expertly trained retail team members” administer the piercings. The debut of Invicta Tequila is for sale exclusively aboard 26 cruise ships worldwide, produced for the Invicta Watch Group by Mexico's Casa Maestri Distillery. Onboard tastings and personalized activations are offered. Engraving stations for personalizing jewelry are being set up. Mail-order services for most of the jewelry and watch brands sold at Starboard shops began rolling out in mid-May. Passengers can view digital catalogues on iPads to select styles, ring sizes or colors that not on the ship and have them shipped home. Rolling out financing through FlexPay with interest free, interest bearing and buy now, pay later options. The rollout began four months ago on Carnival and is being extended to all Starboard cruise line partners. “Most guests on cruises are celebrating something with their loved ones, whether it's a birthday, an anniversary or a family milestone so they come with a desire to splurge, to discover new brands and items connected to the destination they're traveling to,” Capeci said. “But most importantly, they want to mark the time with something meaningful, and we all know that jewelry and timepieces are among the most special ways to mark an event or a vacation, and remember time spent together with loved ones. For those reasons, most voyages we sell on do quite a nice business in fine jewelry. Fine jewelry and watches are probably 40 percent or more of our total sales. It's very significant.” Sales at Starboard's cruise line boutiques are selling at much higher rate than pre-COVID-19, globally, with the exception of China, Capeci said. “Pre-COVID, we did a significant business on ships sailing out of Shanghai and mainland China. That market has not returned. “The largest region in terms of retail value and sales is the Caribbean by far because of the sheer number of passengers that sail in the Caribbean and the size of the ships,” Capeci said. Cruises in Alaska and the Mediterranean, particularly summertime, also generate “very significant” business. Asked what's selling best, Capeci said: “Diamonds are huge. Yellow gold is huge. Materials that are connected to the destinations they travel to are very important. So if they're going to Australia, they want opals. If they're going to South America, they want green emeralds. The destination they're traveling to and the jewelry that we're offering are always connected. You could buy emeralds at home, but it's not as meaningful as it is when you just visited that location of their origin.” The Invicta brand, founded in La Chaux-de-Fonds, Switzerland, in 1837, “is one of our most successful and longest running partners for watches,” Capeci said. “They're moving into more lifestyle-driven programs...."

mov_B5A76778D7F7E2CCF221E860E09FF3AB,2025-07-02 19:17:26,en,WEB,"  ABSTRACT The designer showed his first men's collection. Was it any good? FULL TEXT A photo of Christian Dior's original salon stretched the width of the Invalides, the gold-domed palace where Napoleon is buried, offering a fish-eye view of the past to the throngs shrieking outside - and a sign of just where Dior believes it belongs in the pantheon of French power. Inside, dove-gray velvet lined the walls of a temporary event space and displayed two rare 18th-century oils by Jean Siméon Chardin on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland and the Louvre. Robert Pattinson gossiped with Josh O'Connor. Donatella Versace schmoozed with Roger Federer. A pregnant Rihanna arrived with ASAP Rocky a mere 45 minutes after the official start time. That's how much anticipation there was for the Dior men's show. The filmmaker Luca Guadagnino was even trailing around to document the moment. It was Jonathan Anderson's debut as the creative director/savior of the house, the first designer to be put in charge of both men's and women's wear. And under all the buzz, a giant question mark hovered: Could the former Loewe wunderkind reignite excitement not just in the brand but in fashion? Mr. Anderson made it look easy. Literally. Beginning with his take on the Bar jacket, the most famous Dior women's wear shape - the one that prompted the Harper's Bazaar editor Carmel Snow to jump out of her seat shrieking, ""It's a New Look!"" in 1947. It was reimagined in a Donegal tweed with a flat back and a whiff of the hourglass at the front, as if it retained a vague memory of what it once was. With it, he paired not a shirt but a stiff white stock collar and a pair of oversize white cotton cargo shorts, each side sporting elaborate folds to create the plumped out silhouette of a goose, or a 1948 couture dress called the Delft. Go on, shake your tail feathers. If little Lord Fauntleroy had spent a year at U.S.C. and then returned for a pickup game of basketball at Versailles, this is how he might dress. It was not a capital N New Look. It wasn't that radical, or shocking. But it was an awfully charming newish one. And it was situated smack in the middle of the tension between formality and informality, men's wear and women's wear, commerce and creativity (Mr. Anderson's own work at Loewe and Uniqlo and what he inherited at Dior), which seems to define this particular moment. No one is all one thing or another. Neither are their clothes. Neither are the totems of wealth. What Mr. Anderson proposed was a clear and convincing argument that contradictions can gracefully coexist. Most of all, he put forward the belief that fashion and wearability are not irreconcilable ideas - that you either have to look bizarro or look boring. For every highfalutin garment there was an equal and opposite this-old-thing, usually worn together. Velvet frock coats were paired with faded jeans in Japanese denim. Olive green puffer coats and down vests were cut with trapeze backs. The exact pattern of another classic Dior dress, the Caprice, with its elaborately swathed peplum skirt, was applied to a pair of loose khakis, giving one leg the fillip of a drape. An 18th-century frock coat was exactingly reproduced - in moleskin. There were shamrocks on tennis shoes and high-tops with driving shoe soles; cable knits under elaborate waist coats. There was a lot of neck action. Book totes borrowed, again, from the women's line, with actual book titles on them from Baudelaire and Françoise Sagan. Mr. Anderson had clearly done his homework. Easter eggs to early Dior were everywhere. Even the labels inside the clothes were in the designer's preferred silk faille. He was never going to toss everything out the window and start again. He couldn't. Dior is a multibillion-dollar business, after all, and some of his predecessors (Raf Simons, Hedi Slimane, John Galliano) were his idols. Once upon a time, a designer might have had the arrogance to wipe the slate clean, but this is a new age. The industry is in crisis, and the creative tectonic plates are shifting. It is why Mr. Anderson invited seemingly every other designer in Paris to join him at the show. It is also why he picked the Chardin oils and why he seeded his Instagram with Warhol Polaroids of Lee Radziwill and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Chardin, he said in a preview, ""kind of loosened up the still life""; Warhol made pop culture high art. Both crystallized an inflection point in culture...."

El diseño exclusivo, valorado en 300 mil dólares, causó revuelo en redes sociales y medios internacionales por su confección, simbolismo y la razón emocional detrás de su elección. El diseño fue obra de la casa de moda Dior Haute Couture, conocido por vestir a celebridades en eventos de alto perfil. El vestido, confeccionado a mano en Francia, tardó más de 600 horas de trabajo artesanal y estaba elaborado con seda blanca italiana, bordados personalizados y detalles en pedrería fina. Según fuentes cercanas a la pareja citadas por medios estadounidenses como People y Vogue, Lauren eligió ese vestido no solo por estética, sino por su significado: “Quería algo que representara poder, elegancia y su nueva etapa como mujer y esposa de uno de los empresarios más influyentes del mundo”. Lauren Sánchez eligió estilo con propósito El vestido contaba con una cola de más de tres metros, un corsé entallado y una capa transparente que recordaba a los estilos clásicos hollywoodenses. Para completar el look, Sánchez utilizó joyas de diamantes diseñadas exclusivamente para ella por Lorraine Schwartz, valoradas en más de 2 millones de dólares. En redes sociales, los fans comentaron: “Una reina moderna” o “¡Ese vestido sí que es de otro planeta!” . Incluso celebridades como Kris Jenner y Naomi Campbell reaccionaron con emojis de asombro y corazones. Una boda digna de la lista Forbes La ceremonia privada se llevó a cabo en una villa costera en la Riviera Amalfitana, Italia, con solo 150 invitados seleccionados, incluyendo a figuras como Bill Gates, Oprah Winfrey, Leonardo DiCaprio y Salma Hayek. La fiesta incluyó fuegos artificiales, cenas gourmet y una orquesta sinfónica que interpretó una versión exclusiva de “Can't Help Falling in Love”. Más allá del glamour, el vestido también fue visto como un mensaje de empoderamiento. Lauren Sánchez, quien ha consolidado su carrera en medios y filantropía, “quiso representar independencia, fortaleza y compromiso en una sola pieza de alta costura”, reveló una fuente a Harper's Bazaar. El impacto de la elección de Lauren El vestido no solo marcó un momento icónico en la moda nupcial de celebridades, sino que también generó tendencia. En menos de 24 horas, búsquedas como “vestido Lauren Sánchez boda” y “vestido de novia Dior 2025” se dispararon en plataformas como Google y Pinterest. Mientras algunos celebran la elegancia de la elección, otros debaten el costo y el mensaje detrás del lujo. Pero lo cierto es que la boda Bezos-Sánchez ya se ha inscrito entre las más comentadas del año."

mov_2CCEF76AD199EDB8C9E6E24FF8B7DBCB,2025-07-02 19:47:28,en,WEB,"  1. Rise in Fashion Industry Enforcement as Green Claims Directive Stalls In recent years, legislative initiatives have increasingly reflected the green agenda and sustainability objectives of the European Commission (the Commission). Authorities have been paying closer attention to unfair commercial practices, including the dissemination of inaccurate corporate responsibility disclosures and false or exaggerated environmental claims. The fashion industry has emerged as a key focus area, with national agencies across Europe intensifying efforts to investigate greenwashing, deceptive labeling, and misleading ethical assertions, especially concerning labour practices. In the past month or so, two pivotal developments unfolded: The first one took place on 25 May 2025, when the Commission formally joined forces with several national competition authorities in urging the online fashion giant SHEIN to comply with EU consumer protection laws. The request followed a coordinated investigation that uncovered suspected fake discounts, manipulation of reviews and ratings, deceptive product labels, and misleading sustainability claims. This joint enforcement action complements a separate, ongoing Commission investigation under the Digital Services Act (DSA). The DSA imposes heightened due diligence obligations aimed at ensuring transparency and consumer trust in digital markets on very large online platforms (VLOPs), and SHEIN was designated a VLOP in April 2024. The second development occurred just last week, when the Commission announced - and later clarified - its intention to withdraw support for the Green Claims Directive (GCD) unless the Council's proposed amendment to include 30 million micro-enterprises within its scope was removed. Micro-enterprises are defined as companies with fewer than 10 employees and less than €2 million in revenue. Originally unveiled in March 2023, the GCD aimed to protect consumers from misleading environmental marketing by requiring companies to have their green claims independently verified. The final text of the Directive had been expected imminently. The Commission's reversal is formally grounded in concerns that the Directive, as amended, would impose a disproportionate administrative burden on small businesses. At the same time, there is growing concern that the GCD's stringent requirements could inadvertently discourage companies from communicating their environmental efforts—a phenomenon known as 'greenhushing'—or worse, deter them from pursuing sustainability initiatives altogether. The uncertainty surrounding the future of the GCD should not be interpreted, without more, as a rollback of the EU's broader sustainability agenda. Rather than signaling a retreat from environmental regulation, the Commission's recent move reflects a recalibration of scope and priorities. It is now up to the co-legislators to consider the Commission's position and renegotiate the Directive's scope. Importantly, the rest of the EU's green regulatory framework—including measures targeting greenwashing—remains intact and continues to advance. We recall that just last year, the Commission adopted two key green directives that embed sustainability into the EU's regulatory fabric. The first is designed to empower consumers during the green transition, strengthening safeguards against unfair commercial practices and ensuring access to reliable, verifiable product information. The second introduces more robust requirements around corporate sustainability reporting, reinforcing transparency and accountability. Member states have until next year to transpose both directives into national law, after which enforcement — particularly around deceptive green claims — is expected to intensify. 2. Reform Milestones As consumer scrutiny of ethical and environmental claims intensifies, the EU has rolled out a series of landmark policies targeting greenwashing, unethical labour practices, and digital consumer risks — particularly in high-impact sectors like fashion. Here is how the regulatory landscape has evolved in recent years: 3. Overview of Investigations Targeting Greenwashing and Unfair Practices Across Europe and the UK EU Investigates SHEIN and Temu Over Online Practices and Consumer Risks The Commission's recent enforcement action against SHEIN underscores the importance and gravity the EU attaches to greenwashing, false ethical claims, and other unfair practices. In this particular case, the Commission is investigating a variety of other SHEIN practices, which range from the presence of illegal goods and content on its platform to the opacity of its recommender system that influences the range of products recommended to users first, through a parallel, complementary DSA inquiry. The Commission has also asked the retailer to provide information on the measures adopted to mitigate risks relating to consumer protection, public health, users' well-being, and the processing of data. Another Chinese e-commerce giant, Temu, received a similar request for information, at the same time as SHEIN, after receipt of a consumer complaint alleging that the exponential increase in Temu's user base is the result of aggressive marketing that may violate EU consumer protection laws, notably articles 7, 34, 35, 38, and 40 of the DSA. The company is under investigation for failure to ensure traceability of those trading on the platform; lack of transparency; and insufficient measures to protect minors and mitigate the risks stemming from the service's allegedly addictive design and illegal product listings. The Dutch Authorities Rigorously Pursue Greenwashing In 2023, the Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (ACM) updated its guidelines on sustainability claims, introducing stricter requirements around clarity, accuracy, and specificity. This followed a wave of enforcement activity that began in 2022, when the ACM launched investigations into corporate green claims across the fashion sector. It concluded that Decathlon and H&M had made vague or misleading sustainability statements. Both companies committed to revising their labeling and online messaging practices and agreed to donate to sustainability causes as partial remediation for their lack of transparency. The ACM also took part in a broader European enforcement initiative examining SHEIN's environmental and ethical claims. Separately, in 2023, the Dutch Advertising Code Committee investigated a greenwashing complaint against Primark, further highlighting regulators' growing focus on sustainability messaging in the fashion industry. From Armani to SHEIN: Italy Scrutinizes Green and Ethical Fashion Claims In July 2024, the Italian Competition Authority (AGCM) initiated proceedings and carried out inspections at the premises of Giorgio Armani and Christian Dior for alleged breaches of the Italian Consumer Code in their advertising of clothing and accessories. The Dior probe was closed just last month without finding an infringement after the company gave a set of legally binding commitments designed to address any possible false statements in ethics and social responsibility statements. In September 2024, AGCM also launched an investigation against Infinite Styles for possible generic, vague, confusing, and/or misleading environmental claims made in relation to SHEIN's Italian website. The authority focused on the misleading use of unclear claims such as “'circularity'” and “'green' fibres,” lack of information on additional recyclability of the garment, and contradictions between the company's sustainability reports in previous years and its commitment to decarbonise. The CMA Tightens Scrutiny on Green Cla..."

I've focused on paraphrasing, restructuring, and adding relevant details. Because the original text is fragmented, I've assumed it's a blog post or article about a pop-up store event.

Magenta & Anoblier's successful Seongsu-dong Pop-Up: A Blend of Fashion and Community A New Retail Experience Gains Momentum The fashion landscape is constantly evolving, with brands increasingly turning to experiential retail to connect with consumers. A recent example of this trend is the collaborative pop-up store hosted by Magenta and the clothing company Anoblier in the trendy Seongsu-dong district of Seoul. while the store quietly opened its doors a few days prior, the event reached a peak on Friday, June 27th, with a special visit from Magenta herself. this event highlights a growing strategy in the South Korean market, where pop-up stores are becoming a crucial component of brand building and direct consumer engagement. Seongsu-dong: The Epicenter of Cool Seongsu-dong has rapidly transformed from a largely industrial area into a vibrant hub for fashion, art, and cafes. Once known for its workshops and factories, the district now attracts a young, design-conscious demographic. According to a recent report by the Seoul Metropolitan Government, foot traffic in Seongsu-dong has increased by over 40% in the last two years, making it a prime location for brands seeking to create buzz and reach a new audience. The area's unique aesthetic – a blend of raw industrial spaces and modern design – provides the perfect backdrop for innovative retail concepts. Think of it as the South Korean equivalent of Brooklyn's DUMBO or London's Shoreditch, areas known for their creative energy and autonomous spirit. The Collaboration: Magenta & Anoblier the partnership between Magenta and Anoblier represents a strategic alignment of brands. Magenta, known for [ Insert information about Magenta's brand identity – e.g., its focus on sustainable practices, unique design aesthetic, or target audience], brought its distinctive style to the collaboration.Anoblier, a clothing company specializing in [ Insert information about Anoblier's clothing style – e.g., minimalist designs, high-quality materials, or specific clothing categories], provided the apparel component.

The collaboration is similar to the successful partnerships seen between high-end fashion houses and streetwear brands, like Dior and Stüssy, which generate significant media attention and appeal to a wider customer base. Beyond the Sale: Building Community The pop-up wasn't just about selling clothes; it was about creating an experience. The event featured [ insert details about the event – e.g., interactive displays, workshops, music, or special promotions].

Consumers are increasingly looking for experiences that go beyond simply purchasing products. They wont to feel connected to the brands they support and to other like-minded individuals. A recent study by Deloitte found that 73% of consumers say that experience is a key factor in their purchasing decisions.Looking Ahead: The Future of Pop-Up Retail The success of the Magenta & Anoblier pop-up store demonstrates the continued relevance of this retail format.Pop-up stores offer brands a flexible and cost-effective way to test new markets, launch new products, and build brand awareness.As the retail landscape continues to evolve, we can expect to see even more innovative and experiential pop-up concepts emerge. the key will be to create events that are not only visually appealing but also offer genuine value and foster a sense of community. Addressing the JSON-like Structure: The original text included snippets of what appears to be JSON data embedded within HTML. This suggests the content was likely generated or managed by a content management system (CMS) or a platform that uses structured data. The JSON elements define the type of content (e.g., “text”), style attributes (e.g., background color, font color), and the actual data being displayed.This structure is common in modern web development, allowing for dynamic content rendering and easier content management. Though, for a standard article format, this underlying structure is not necessary and has been removed in the rewritten version. The information contained within the JSON data (e.g., styling) has been incorporated directly into the HTML and text formatting of the article.

This artist resonates deeply with a dedicated and unconventional fanbase, fostering a connection built on shared experiences – both celebratory and poignant. Recent trends demonstrate a growing demand for immersive fan interactions,and while physical events frequently enough face capacity limitations,innovative solutions are emerging to bridge the gap between artists and their supporters. The recent pop-up event, though constrained by physical space, successfully leveraged digital platforms to extend its reach. A prime example of this adaptability was the inclusion of the QWER broadcast, made accessible to a wider audience thanks to a blessed lottery winner and the platform's online streaming capabilities. This mirrors a broader shift in the entertainment industry, where virtual experiences are becoming increasingly prevalent...."

Recorded from Channel 4+1 on Monday 22nd December 2008 21:58  The last recording today is the first episode in a three part series of ghost stories for Christmas, Crooked House - The Wainscoting. A man brings an old door knocker to an antiques expert, and hears some ghost stories about the house it came from. Lee Ingleby plays the man, Ben. Mark Gatiss, who also wrote this, plays the ""Curator"". The first story concerns a Mr Joseph Bloxham, a man who has recently bought the house in question, Geap Manor and is having it modernised. He's also recently been involved in a financial ""bubble"", making money himself, but having seen many people lose everything when the scheme collapsed. He's played by Philip Jackson. Julian Rhind-Tutt plays his friend, Noakes, who takes him to task for his part of a scheme that led to at least one man going to debtor's prison. Andy Nyman plays his other friend Duncalfe. Bloxham is slightly annoyed that his workman who are modernising the house aren't going to be finished when they said they would. Mr Coil tells him ""I can only apologise, Mr Bloxham. But real craftsmanship cannot be rushed, sir. You wouldn't want that, would you?"" ""No, no, of course not."" ""I mean, you could get in any nickninnie to take on a job like this, but you'd regret it."" ""Yes, yes."" ""Well, you have my absolute assurance that my men and me will have quit the place by the end of October."" ""You swear it?"" ""Give or take."" Coil shows him the new wainscoting he's put in, with the very finest timber, as requested. Bloxham asks about some staining on the wood. ""And of course, the wainscoting will soon be painted, will it not? A nice sage green. Look lovely in here, Mr Bloxham. I like a green."" Some time later, Bloxham is accosted by Mrs Glanville, wife of a man who was thrown in prison for debts after the collapse of Bloxham's scheme. ""My husband, sir, blew his brains out last evening."" ""What?"" ""He procured a pistol. How I know not. Then he wrote me a short farewell. And then he took his own life."" ""My deepest sympathies, madam."" ""My own dear Harry. A fine man, Joseph Bloxham. A kind man...."

mov_78143AB206C79744674BEC7A8B71B510,2025-07-03 04:58:24,en,WEB,"  Luxury fashion houses are increasingly bypassing traditional media outlets and forging direct relationships with fashion creators through social media, offering exclusive previews and behind-the-scenes access. This shift, observed during the recent menswear season, signals a strategic realignment in how brands build hype and control their narrative. On June 24, Pharrell Williams, the creative director of Louis Vuitton Men's, personally messaged Albert Ayal, a talent scout for the fashion Instagram account @UpNextDesigner, with early details of the collection. “Hey — wanted you to be the first to see details of the collection from tonight's LV Men's show. Sending some pics soon,” the message read, originating from the @Skateboard Instagram account, Louis Vuitton's platform for behind-the-scenes content. Ayal promptly shared a screenshot of the direct message to his Instagram story. The Rise of the DM Reveal Ayal's experience wasn't isolated. Bally extended a similar courtesy to Scott Staniland, a sustainable fashion creator and consultant, sending him a photograph from the brand's Milan presentation, which Staniland then shared with his followers. Maison Margiela took a slightly different approach, directly inviting fashion critic Ashantéa Austin to its couture show via direct message, a moment Austin documented and shared as a reel. Perhaps the most proactive strategy came from Dior. In anticipation of Jonathan Anderson's menswear debut, the brand added content creator and fashion critic Hanan Besovic (@IDeserveCouture) to its Instagram “Close Friends” list. This granted Besovic exclusive access to sneak peeks of Anderson's mood boards and handbag designs, content she subsequently shared on both TikTok and Instagram. A New Era of Brand-Influencer Dynamics This trend represents a significant departure from traditional public relations practices. By directly engaging with key influencers, luxury brands are attempting to cultivate a more authentic and immediate connection with their target audiences. The practice also allows for greater control over messaging, as brands can share information directly, unfiltered by journalistic interpretation. The willingness of creators to publicly share these direct messages – screenshots and reels – further amplifies the brand's reach, effectively turning the initial outreach into additional marketing content. This symbiotic relationship highlights the growing power of social media marketing within the luxury sector and the increasing value placed on the curated perspectives of online tastemakers. The move towards direct engagement suggests a broader industry recognition that traditional media cycles are no longer sufficient to generate the desired level of buzz and consumer excitement. Instead, brands are prioritizing speed, exclusivity, and the perceived authenticity of influencer endorsements. This strategy is likely to continue evolving as the digital landscape shifts and new platforms emerge. Related"

Socialite and philanthropist Natasha Poonawalla's look from Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding in Dolce and Gabbana is a stunning example of high fashion. Natasha, who graced the wedding festivities in Venice, Italy, alongside celebs like Oprah Winfrey, Kylie Jenner, Kim Kardashian, and Orlando Bloom, took to Instagram on July 3 to share photos of herself in a theatrical white gown. Natasha Poonawalla shines in golden vintage Dior dress at Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's 'spectacular' wedding in Italy Natasha's look was all about grandeur, opulence When it comes to dressing to impress, few celebs match up to Natasha, and her high-fashion looks never fail to impress. Natasha's floor-length dress with intricate details and embellishments from Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding has now caught everyone's attention. Even her friend, actor Priyanka Chopra, gushed over it as Natasha shared photos on Instagram and wrote in her caption, “Living out my Venetian morning fantasy.” Priyanka commented, “Yas show us how it's done queen.” Natasha is the executive director of the Serum Institute of India and is married to CEO of the Serum Institute of India, Adar Poonawalla. What did Natasha Poonawalla wear? Dolce and Gabbana's designs often draw inspiration from Italian heritage, art, and culture. Their aesthetic combines classic elegance with modern twists, and Natasha's white gown was all about mixing grace with drama. It featured a fitted sleeveless top and a voluminous skirt. A pannier made her gown stand out as it created a wide, bell-shaped silhouette for her skirt. A romantic hairstyle featuring soft curls and an oversized white bow with a half-down style made her look even more dreamy. A layered choker necklace with pearls added a touch of sophistication to the overall whimsical look. Earlier, Natasha also shared photos of her look from Jeff and Lauren's wedding festivities in Venice. The Amazon founder and former journalist married on June 27 in a lavish ceremony on the island of San Giorgio Maggiore in Venice, Italy. The ceremony was attended by around 200 guests, with the wedding festivities kicking off earlier in the week and costing around $50 million in total.

mov_0C31A16BA2532CF9CF37DA75CA81F56B,2025-07-03 06:23:15,en,WEB,"  Change is afoot as fashion's musical chairs comes to a halt. When it comes to shifts in creative direction, menswear collections and the vision they represent have always served as the tip of the iceberg in signalling where the brand is headed. Often, they reflect a calculated risk or a tamer approach that holds more tightly to the brand's core values, in consideration of their male consumers and a smaller vernacular of silhouettes to play with. As Men's Fashion Week comes to an end, Men's Folio dissects the Top 5 trends for Spring/Summer 2026. FIT FLOP Where we come from, there has always been a slightly negative connotation when it comes to pairing open-toed footwear with trousers — anything but shorts, really. Can Spring/Summer 2026 usher in a shift in the perception commonly associated with a lack of sartorial care when one dons their slides or sandals with denim or chinos? As demonstrated by Hermes, Yohji Yamamoto and Dolce & Gabbana, what makes their trouser and chancla pairing feel like the epitome of casual summer dressing comes down to the fluidity of the trousers. A rigid dress pant may feel out of place, but lightweight materials that flow create a congruent impression when worn with sandals. This explains why the Dolce's “business on top, slumber party at the bottom” ensemble looks harmonious. DRAMATIC SUITING Suits in the summer should be anything but stuffy — across their construction, materials and finishes. The Power Suit takes on a slightly different connotation at Louis Gabriel Nouchi's Spring/Summer 26 collection, as he explores the notion of power through the lens of sexuality. Eroticism does not mean being unclothed, as Nouchi presents relaxed double-breasted suits styled with latex ties. Silhouettes portraying dramatic shoulders and a nipped-in waist take place, inspired by the Zoot Suit, are seen across EgonLab and Wooyoungmi, perhaps as a trickle-down effect from the last Met Gala that showcased facets of black dandyism. The most direct nod comes from Willy Chavarria during his PFW showcase, where the suit has been used to symbolise the identity and influence of immigrants, referencing his cultural upbringing. PRECARIOUS PASTELS Can pastels still be groundbreaking for Spring/Summer? Sure, answers Zegna, Prada and and Jonathan Anderson's debut collection for Dior. Rather than just desaturated colours for a demure impression, Zegna portrays a palette bleached by the sun from constant exposure, while Prada juxtaposed its simple silhouettes with sickly, off-kilter pastels that still commanded attention. Although Dior's use of pastels comes across as a display of affluence in ways an affinity for light-coloured clothing may convey a nonchalance towards wear, Willy Chavarria's take carries a form of rebellion worn on the backs of the working class. GO TO SLEEP, GIRL Amazing what rest and relaxation does to tired minds. Loungewear takes on a more literal interpretation — beyond just relaxed shirtings and short shorts for Spring/Summer 26. Dolce & Gabbana materialises the concept of rolling out your bed and starting your day immediately through a collection of pyjamas, worn together or as separates in all their wrinkled glory. AMIRI envisions winding down at their fictional Chateau through luxurious smoking jackets and matching lounge pants, complete with leather slippers. WHEN I GROW UP Through the lens of a child, the adult world may forge an impression of limitless opportunities and freedom. Before the concept of a business analyst or an SEO writer comes into their worldview as more conventional career pathways, there is an optimism tied to how work and adulthood are presented — as a pursuit of joy and self-driven purpose, rather than stakeholder value. Painters are seen on the runways, where childhood ambition is interpreted through paint-stained workwear at KidSuper and vests to hold paintbrushes at Homme Plisse Issey Miyake. Kenzo also proposes a joyful wardrobe that envisions adult dressing with a juvenile flair, through playful Lisa Frank-style illustrations, band jackets (also seen on the runways of Dior) and stickerbombed flat-brim caps.

2589BEB9B14AC7175588ED5AAA109DC6,2025-07-03 07:18:43,en,PRINT,"  A photo of Christian Dior's original salon stretched the width of the Invalides, the gold-domed palace where Napoleon is buried, offering a fish-eye view of the past to the throngs shrieking outside -- and a sign of just where Dior believes it belongs in the pantheon of French power. Inside, dove-gray velvet lined the walls of a temporary event space and displayed two rare 18th-century oils by Jean Siméon Chardin on loan from the National Galleries of Scotland and the Louvre. Robert Pattinson gossiped with Josh O'Connor. Donatella Versace schmoozed with Roger Federer. A pregnant Rihanna arrived with ASAP Rocky a mere 45 minutes after the official start time. That's how much anticipation there was for the Dior men's show. The filmmaker Luca Guadagnino was even trailing around to document the moment. It was Jonathan Anderson's debut as the creative director/savior of the house, the first designer to be put in charge of both men's and women's wear. And under all the buzz, a giant question mark hovered: Could the former Loewe wunderkind reignite excitement not just in the brand but in fashion? Mr. Anderson made it look easy. Literally. Beginning with his take on the Bar jacket, the most famous Dior women's wear shape -- the one that prompted the Harper's Bazaar editor Carmel Snow to jump out of her seat shrieking, ''It's a New Look!'' in 1947. It was reimagined in a Donegal tweed with a flat back and a whiff of the hourglass at the front, as if it retained a vague memory of what it once was. With it, he paired not a shirt but a stiff white stock collar and a pair of oversize white cotton cargo shorts, each side sporting elaborate folds to create the plumped out silhouette of a goose, or a 1948 couture dress called the Delft. Go on, shake your tail feathers. If little Lord Fauntleroy had spent a year at U.S.C. and then returned for a pickup game of basketball at Versailles, this is how he might dress. It was not a capital N New Look. It wasn't that radical, or shocking. But it was an awfully charming newish one. And it was situated smack in the middle of the tension between formality and informality, men's wear and women's wear, commerce and creativity (Mr. Anderson's own work at Loewe and Uniqlo and what he inherited at Dior), which seems to define this particular moment. No one is all one thing or another. Neither are their clothes. Neither are the totems of wealth. What Mr. Anderson proposed was a clear and convincing argument that contradictions can gracefully coexist. Most of all, he put forward the belief that fashion and wearability are not irreconcilable ideas -- that you either have to look bizarro or look boring. For every highfalutin garment there was an equal and opposite this-old-thing, usually worn together. Velvet frock coats were paired with faded jeans in Japanese denim. Olive green puffer coats and down vests were cut with trapeze backs. The exact pattern of another classic Dior dress, the Caprice, with its elaborately swathed peplum skirt, was applied to a pair of loose khakis, giving one leg the fillip of a drape. An 18th-century frock coat was exactingly reproduced -- in moleskin. There were shamrocks on tennis shoes and high-tops with driving shoe soles; cable knits under elaborate waist coats. There was a lot of neck action. Book totes borrowed, again, from the women's line, with actual book titles on them from Baudelaire and Françoise Sagan. Mr. Anderson had clearly done his homework. Easter eggs to early Dior were everywhere. Even the labels inside the clothes were in the designer's preferred silk faille. He was never going to toss everything out the window and start again. He couldn't. Dior is a multibillion-dollar business, after all, and some of his predecessors (Raf Simons, Hedi Slimane, John Galliano) were his idols. Once upon a time, a designer might have had the arrogance to wipe the slate clean, but this is a new age. The industry is in crisis, and the creative tectonic plates are shifting. It is why Mr. Anderson invited seemingly every other designer in Paris to join him at the show. It is also why he picked the Chardin oils and why he seeded his Instagram with Warhol Polaroids of Lee Radziwill and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Chardin, he said in a preview, ''kind of loosened up the still life''; Warhol made pop culture high art. Both crystallized an inflection point in culture. Mr. Anderson clearly wants his Dior to do the same. His show invitation came borne on a china plate with three china eggs on top, as if a reminder that the men's wear was just the beginning (and maybe to acknowledge that some shells may get broken along the way). Fair enough. The result may not knock you sideways, but it's likely to make you sit up and buy...."

As the industry's model for working with public figures shifts, the power dynamics are becoming increasingly unclear. On Friday in Paris, the Northern Irish designer Jonathan Anderson will show his first collection as the creative director of the French fashion house Dior. During his previous, 11-year tenure as the creative director of the Spanish brand Loewe, Anderson became known for his avant-garde sensibility and dedication to craft -- but also for his unique ability to turn the internet's so-called boyfriends (those young actors and musicians who are lusted over online with possessive familiarity) into bona fide celebrities. In the front row of Anderson's fall 2024 Loewe men's wear show in Paris were the established actors Jamie Dornan, Andrew Garfield and Nicholas Hoult, but also, seated with equal prominence, emerging ones, including Drew Starkey, who was set to star in ''Queer'' (the 2024 Luca Guadagnino movie for which Anderson oversaw the costumes), and Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist, who would soon appear as romantic leads in Guadagnino's film ''Challengers,'' a film that helped them reach mainstream heartthrob status, and with which Anderson was also involved as a costume designer. The following June, at Anderson's final Loewe men's runway show, the rising actors Kit Connor, Evan Peters and Enzo Vogrincic sat front row -- suggesting, based on the strength of the designer's track record, that they too would also soon become leading men. For Loewe, it was a display of cultural currency; for the actors, it was free publicity. It used to be that an association with a brand was, if not a career-killer, then certainly not chic for an actor. It was hard to be taken seriously as both an artist and a de facto fashion model. But in recent decades, the rise of social media and the expansion of the fashion industry have blurred the lines between model, actor and influencer. Back in the 1980s, the Italian fashion house Armani began dressing Hollywood celebrities, including, most notably, Richard Gere for his role in the 1980 movie ''American Gigolo.'' But gone are the days when one megastar served as a company's global face. Today brands adopt a multitiered system of ambassadors that includes international stars, yes, but also up-and-comers and influencers. While these cliques are often described by their members and parent brands as ''family,'' and frequently represent a genuine affinity, they are also carefully constructed to maximize a company's exposure on red carpets and billboards -- but also very specific corners of TikTok. Now, as this business decision solidifies into standard practice, the question is, Who ultimately wields the power, the celebrities or the brands? Until 2010, ''a few brands had ambassadors, but it was mainly for fragrance,'' says Ben Cercio, the founder of a consulting agency specializing in brand strategy and communications with clients including the French fashion house Givenchy. But with the launch of Instagram that year, a shift occurred: companies began to engage not just with major actors but also with ''microinfluencers'' -- online personalities with less than 100,000 followers -- to reach their audiences early on. And because social media has accelerated the rise to fame, whenever a new talent in any field emerges from the crowd, ''every brand wants to get its hands on them,'' says Cercio. Now an ingénue like the actress Mikey Madison, who starred in last year's ''Anora,'' might have a dozen offers from brands immediately after making a buzzy debut at a festival like Cannes, suggesting that it's often the young actors, rather than the brands, who are in control. When Madison accepted her Oscar for best lead actress in March, she wore a custom look from Dior. Cercio adds that while relationships once developed organically -- a talent would come to a fashion show, be given some pieces and maybe wear something from the latest collection on the red carpet -- increasingly, ''money is very quickly involved.'' Indeed, an ambassadorship is now a coveted deal among celebrities of all tiers. '' There's enough proof in the market of just how great a partnership can look,'' says George Georgopoulos, the director of brand partnerships at Huxley, an agency that represents artists including Charli XCX. After releasing her globally successful album ''Brat,'' last summer, the pop star partnered with companies from H&M to Acne Studios and performed with a seemingly empty Gucci bag on ''Saturday Night Live'' in what appeared to be a wink-wink placement. (She'd headlined the brand's annual LACMA Gala a few weeks before.) Getting a check for simply holding an object, she seemed to imply, was not selling out but making the system work for her. For many celebrities, ''there's more money in the ambassadorship than in a lot of the payments they receive for their work onscreen,'' says the writer and pop culture podcaster Evan Ross Katz. Those funds can free up major actors to pursue less commercial projects, like indie films and plays; they are also increasingly essential for younger performers who aren't yet earning large sums for their creative work. Depending on their level of fame, a celebrity can make anywhere from $50,000 to many millions of dollars with endorsement deals, according to several people who work on confidential contracts. On the lower end are social media posts: An artist with a significant following could be paid $100,000 to $150,000 for a single main-grid post holding a product and tagging a brand. If their following is in the multiple millions, however, these numbers can reach seven figures, one stylist said. Slightly more lucrative are red-carpet appearances. And on the higher end are elaborate contracts that require more than just showing up at Fashion Week twice a year. A deal worth around $3 million, for example, could involve appearing in advertising campaigns, attending events like store openings, being dressed for the red carpet, wearing the brand out more casually for paparazzi shots and creating several social media posts. The prestige of an endorsement deal can also boost the cachet of a relatively unknown artist or internet personality immeasurably. Katz cites the YouTuber Emma Chamberlain and the pop star Addison Rae as two recent examples of social media stars whose fame has grown well beyond their original audience, partly because of their fashion partnerships. Since 2019, Chamberlain has been an ambassador for Louis Vuitton; last year, Rae appeared in a campaign film for Saint Laurent. Likewise, while celebrity ambassadors might not necessarily move units for brands in the short term -- unless they have the influence of a Kardashian or a Hadid -- they give companies exposure to niche but devoted audiences. By putting the actor Jeremy Allen White on a billboard, for example, Calvin Klein helped transform a nascent sex symbol into the kind of established idol the brand more typically casts -- and it got to be a part of the cultural conversation following the success of White's show ''The Bear.'' And when, last summer, Marc Jacobs recruited the viral TikTok chef Nara Smith to ''make'' one of the brand's tote bags from baking ingredients in a tongue-in-cheek video, Smith gained fashion credibility, while the brand got to create a social media moment of its own. Both parties signaled that they were in on the joke. But not all relationships are the right match. '' I remember this desire for fashion to lead the conversation and not follow it,'' says Katz. '' Part of me worries that that's beginning to shift.'' Still, brands are continuing to experiment with new models..."

mov_F4B5B8543CB34C8AB29B72ECA9E19296,2025-07-03 07:39:13,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]La tendencia de “maquillaje sin maquillaje” sigue fuerte, pero con un giro: ahora no solo queremos lucir frescas, también estructuradas. Y para lograrlo sin 17 productos ni gastar una fortuna, entra en escena Rimmel London Sculpting Palette, una joya low cost con tres tonos que trabajan en sinergia: bronceador, iluminador y colorete, todo en un compacto que cabe en cualquier bolso y cuesta apenas 6 euros. ¿Lo mejor? No es una paleta cualquiera. Fue desarrollada junto a Kate Moss, quien aporta ese toque cool británico a una fórmula práctica y efectiva. La promesa de la paleta es clara: esculpir, iluminar y dar color al rostro con naturalidad. Pero en la práctica, también ofrece versatilidad total: El bronceador es de tono neutro, sin subtono naranja, ideal para contorno sutil o efecto sunkissed. El iluminador tiene destello fino, nada glitter, que aporta ese glow elegante estilo Hailey Bieber. El rubor es rosa-melocotón universal, favorecedor en todo tipo de pieles, que da ese toque de vitalidad instantánea. Además, su textura sedosa y modulable permite trabajar las capas sin dejar manchones ni exceso de polvo. Se difumina fácil con brocha, esponja o incluso con los dedos si estás fuera de casa. Rimmel no es nuevo en el juego, pero esta paleta lleva meses en los primeros puestos de ventas de Amazon y es protagonista de muchos tutoriales en TikTok y YouTube. ¿La razón? Hace el trabajo de tres productos de lujo en un solo gesto. Muchas influencers la comparan con: La Filmstar Bronze & Glow de Charlotte Tilbury (pero 40 euros más barata). El Dior Backstage Glow Face Palette, por su efecto de segunda piel. O incluso con Fenty Beauty, en cuanto a practicidad y pigmentación. Además, en un contexto donde buscamos optimizar rutinas y espacio (bye neceser gigante), una paleta todo en uno tiene un valor emocional: es eficiente, compacta y libre de complicaciones. Por 6 euros, la Rimmel Sculpting Palette ofrece calidad, practicidad y versatilidad. Perfecta para principiantes, minimalistas, chicas que viajan o quienes buscan un glow con poco esfuerzo. No sustituye a productos de gama alta en textura extrema o larga duración tipo red carpet, pero para el día a día y looks de oficina o citas, es más que suficiente. Además, es un recordatorio de que el buen maquillaje no tiene por qué costar una fortuna. Porque al final, el estilo es lo que haces con lo que tienes, no lo que cuesta. @mundistyle"

Olivia Palamountain reports Venice's Hotel Cipriani has launched an exclusive Dior bar as part of its 2025 season reopening, marking a new collaboration between the legendary hospitality brand and the French luxury fashion house. Il Bacaro Dior (open Tuesday to Sunday from 6.30pm to 11.30pm) takes in glorious views over St. Mark's basin and features rattan furniture offset by cushions upholstered in green toile de Jouy - a heritage printed cloth produced by Christophe-Philippe Oberkampf in the 18th century. To amplify the branded experience, guests can take archipelago excursions on boats bearing the Dior signature. Located moments from St Mark's Square via the hotel's private boat service, Hotel Cipriani sits on the tip of the island with panoramic views across the Venetian lagoon. The property, which became Belmond's first acquisition in 1976, features Venice's largest private swimming pool, the over-water Cip's Club restaurant and the Casanova wellness centre. Alongside the bar, the luxury fashion house has installed a Dioriviera boutique, selling a collection of branded resortwear. The boutique features art installations including a large bamboo mural by Korakot and a glass sculpture by Simone Crestani, alongside hand-made furniture by Italian manufacturer Bonacina. Also new for 2025 are a series of renovations by architect and interior designer Peter Marino, who has overseen the refined redesign of 13 rooms including two master suites designed as Venetian apartments. Marino's multi-phase renovation includes two master suites featuring dining rooms, libraries and salons with lagoon views, plus 11 suites and junior suites with private balconies overlooking the Casanova Gardens. The architect has maintained the beloved lobby whilst creating an adjacent double-height arrival experience. New lagoon experiences for the summer season include sunset tours and enhanced dining at the Michelin-starred Oro restaurant, led by Chef Yana Ghedini in collaboration with world-renowned chef Massimo Bottura. The Il Bacaro Dior bar and Dioriviera boutique represent the latest luxury brand partnership for the Belmond property, which has operated on Giudecca Island since 1958. Elsewhere this year, Dior has also been busy. In March 2025, The Royal Scotsman, A Belmond Train, collaborated with Dior to create its first wellness retreat on wheels, featuring 'mindful movement' classes and naturopathic menus.

Laut der Nachrichtenagentur AP stand die Durchsuchung im Zusammenhang mit dem Vorwurf des Sexhandels gegen Combs. Die Razzia sei im Rahmen von Strafverfolgungsmaßnahmen nötig gewesen, teilte das zuständigen Heimatschutzministerium mit. Die Mutter von Justin Dior Combs, Modedesignerin und Stylistin Misa Hylton, warf den Polizisten hinterher vor, ihren Sohn und dessen Halbbruder terrorisiert zu haben.

In nur zwei von fünf Anklagepunkten sprachen die Geschworenen den früheren Rap-Superstar vor Gericht in New York schuldig – und das waren die schwächsten Anschuldigungen in Zusammenhang mit Prostitution. Die Vorwürfe der Verschwörung zur organisierten Kriminalität und des Menschenhandels wies die Jury zurück. Das Strafmaß soll wie üblich zu einem späteren Zeitpunkt bekannt gegeben werden. Offenbar ist der 3. Oktober dafür anvisiert. Lesen Sie auch: US-Rapper Sean „P. Diddy“ Combs teilweise schuldig gesprochen „I'm coming home, baby! “ (dt. „Ich komme nach Hause, Baby! “) – mit diesen Worten wandte sich der 55-Jährige laut US-Medien nach der Urteilsverkündung an seine Angehörigen im Gerichtssaal. Die Familie zeigte sich erleichtert und feierte die Entscheidung der Jury. Sowohl Diddys Mutter als auch seine Kinder verließen das Gericht mit lächelnden Gesichtern. „Wir sind so glücklich, mein Pops kommt nach Hause – Gott sei Dank! “, wird einer seiner Söhne zitiert. Combs hat sechs leibliche Kinder und ein Stiefkind mit vier verschiedenen Müttern. Auf Instagram stellen sie sich immer wieder hinter ihren berühmten Vater. Und das, obwohl ihre Familiengeschichte keine leichte ist. Die jüngsten Ereignisse hätten ihre Familie am Boden zerstört zurückgelassen, schrieben sechs von Combs' Kindern nach seiner Verhaftung im September 2024 auf Instagram: Ihr Vater werde „auf der Grundlage von Anschuldigungen, Verschwörungstheorien und falschen Narrativen“ verurteilt, hieß es in dem gemeinsamen Post von Quincy Brown (33), Justin (30), Christian (26), Chance (18) und den Zwillingen Jessie und D'Lila Combs (17). „Wir halten an der Wahrheit fest, weil wir wissen, dass sie siegen wird und nichts die Stärke unserer Familie brechen wird“, so die Kinder weiter. Ihr Statement beendeten sie mit den Worten: „Wir vermissen und lieben dich, Dad. “ In einem weiteren Post gratulierten sie ihm außerdem zum Geburtstag (4. November), den Combs letztes Jahr im Gefängnis verbringen musste. Es ist nicht das erste Mal, dass die Geschwister eine schwere Zeit durchmachen müssen. Die Familiengeschichte ist durchaus dramatisch: Drei seiner sieben Kinder bekam Combs mit dem amerikanischen Model Kim Porter (1970–2018). Wie unter anderem CNN berichtet, soll das Paar von 1994 bis 2007 eine On-off-Beziehung geführt haben. In dieser Zeit wurden Christian und die Zwillinge Jessie und D'Lila geboren. Auch Porters ältesten Sohn, Quincy Brown, hat Combs mit aufgezogen. Er stammt aus ihrer früheren Verbindung mit dem US-Sänger Al B. Sure! . Doch die Kinder der beiden müssen heute ohne ihre Mutter ihren Weg finden: Porter starb im November 2018 mit 47 Jahren plötzlich an den Folgen einer Lungenentzündung. Porters Sohn Quincy konnte mit der Hilfe seines berühmten Stiefvaters seinen großen Leidenschaften, der Schauspielerei und der Musik, nachgehen, wie er 2021 im Interview mit „People“ berichtete. Er sei zwischen Georgia und New York aufgewachsen – schon in ihrer Kindheit hätten er und seine Geschwister Combs auf Tour begleitet. Brown ist laut „People“ auch der Manager seiner beiden kleinen Schwestern Jessie und D'Lila. Die Zwillinge besuchen die Privatschule „Sierra Canyon“ in Los Angeles, doch auch sie stehen schon in jungen Jahren in der Öffentlichkeit: Auf ihrem gemeinsamen Instagram–Account „the_combs_twins“ folgen ihnen knapp 750.000 Menschen. Dort zeigen sie sich unter anderem als begeisterte Cheerleader. Mit ihrer Schule gewannen sie in diesem Jahr einen nationalen Wettbewerb. Über mehr als dreimal so viele Follower freut sich ihr Bruder Christian. Der 26–Jährige ist als Model und Rapper aktiv und betitelt sich selbst auf Instagram als „kingcombs“. Nicht nur die Musikrichtung hat er mit seinem berühmten Vater gemein: Wie unter anderem die „FAZ“ berichtet, wurden auch gegen ihn Missbrauchsvorwürfe laut. Ende 2022 soll er auf einer Yacht, die sein Vater gechartert hatte, unter anderem versucht haben, eine Kellnerin zum Oralsex zu zwingen und ihr mit Betäubungsmitteln versetzten Tequila einzuflößen. Der Vorwurf war rund eine Woche nach einer Razzia in Sean Combs' Villa in Los Angeles aufgekommen, bei der auch Combs' Söhne Christian und Justin Dior in Handschellen gelegt worden waren. Laut der Nachrichtenagentur AP stand die Durchsuchung im Zusammenhang mit dem Vorwurf des Sexhandels gegen Combs. Die Razzia sei im Rahmen von Strafverfolgungsmaßnahmen nötig gewesen, teilte das zuständigen Heimatschutzministerium mit. Die Mutter von Justin Dior Combs, Modedesignerin und Stylistin Misa Hylton, warf den Polizisten hinterher vor, ihren Sohn und dessen Halbbruder terrorisiert zu haben. Dies war nicht das erste Mal, dass auch Justin Dior mit dem Gesetz in Konflikt geriet. Amerikanischen Medienberichten zufolge wurde er im Juni 2023 wegen Trunkenheit am Steuer angeklagt und im Herbst desselben Jahres zu drei Jahren auf Bewährung verurteilt. Der 30-Jährige hatte Soziologie an der University of California in Los Angeles studiert, bevor er sich als Schauspieler versuchte. Seit seiner Verhaftung wurde es jedoch in den sozialen Netzwerken eher still um ihn. Über Combs' jüngste Tochter Chance ist zwar noch nichts dergleichen zu lesen, aber ihr Geburtsdatum ist brisant: Die heute 18-Jährige wurde nur fünf Monate vor seinen Zwillingen geboren – allerdings nicht von Kim Porter, sondern von Sarah Chapman. Die Unternehmerin soll laut Medienberichten auch der Grund sein, warum Combs' On-off-Beziehung mit Porter endgültig in die Brüche ging. Combs und Chapman sollen laut „People“ jahrelang befreundet gewesen sein...."

La influencer ha compartido una imagen desde el coche que resume a la perfección su filosofía de estilo: mezcla de romanticismo, sofisticación y, por supuesto, mucho lujo. Una estampa que podría formar parte de cualquier campaña editorial, y que en su caso, es simplemente un Story de su cuenta de Instagram de su día a día. El estilo de Georgina Rodríguez se caracteriza por una mezcla de elegancia, sensualidad y tendencias actuales, a menudo con un toque de lujo. Su imagen se asocia con marcas de alta gama como Dior y Chanel, pero también se atreve con looks más atrevidos y juveniles, como los inspirados en la estética ""motomami"" o la combinación de prendas deportivas con piezas de vestir. El look de lujo de Georgina Rodríguez En la imagen, Georgina Rodríguez aparece con un vestido blanco de tirantes anchos con bordado inglés, un diseño femenino, de aire veraniego y silueta entallada que resalta su figura y aporta frescura sin perder el glamour. Un básico elevado que, en su caso, se transforma en look de alto impacto gracias a la forma en que lo combina. ¿Los accesorios? Una auténtica declaración de intenciones: bolso Birkin de Hermès en tono beige, gafas XL de Chanel con logo dorado visible en las patillas, reloj de alta gama, un espectacular anillo de diamantes talla esmeralda, manicura en rojo pasión y un collar brillante en forma de Y que completa el conjunto con el brillo que la caracteriza. Georgina no necesita palabras: basta una imagen para confirmar que sigue siendo un referente absoluto del lujo aspiracional. Y aunque el vestido podría ser una pieza romántica en clave boho para cualquier otra, ella lo convierte en una oda a la ostentación chic, con ese estilo propio que mezcla la alta costura con el day-to-day de una estrella internacional."

Certes, le bateau était élégant, en bois d'acajou, une sorte de limousine des canaux... Mais rien à voir avec son clinquant yacht, le Koru,immense, doté d'une plateforme pour hélicoptère, long de 125 mètres avec un mât de près de 70 mètres, qui patientait plus au sud, amarré en Croatie. Initialement, l'ogre d'Amazon, qui rêve d'atteindre la Lune avec son programme Blue Origin, devait faire son entrée dans la cité des Doges à bord de son yacht, pour épouser l'ancienne journaliste et productrice Lauren Sanchez le 27 juin. Mais voilà. Jeff Bezos étant Jeff Bezos, avec son entourage prestigieux, a dû revoir ses plans à la demande de la préfecture de Venise. Selon nos informations, la situation en Iran après l'attaque israélienne a fait grimper le niveau de sécurité à son maximum autour de cette union. N'est-il pas l'un des hommes les plus riches du monde, symbole de l'Amérique triomphante ? N'a-t-il pas convié à ses noces Ivanka Trump, la fille de Donald, et son époux, Jared Kushner, ancien conseiller spécial du président républicain pour le Moyen-Orient ? N'a-t-il pas invité la reine Rania de Jordanie, ainsi que son fils héritier du trône ? Sans compter quelques convives israéliens, comme Aviv Nevo, actionnaire de Time Warner, eBay... ou Yuri Milner, capital-risqueur milliardaire. Noces du pouvoir et du glamour Alors oui, il y en avait des gardes du corps, muscles tendus sous les costumes noirs, sortant d'hôtels 4 étoiles pour retrouver leur protégé(e) dans les palaces vénitiens privatisés - le Gritti, le St. Régis, l'Aman... ; des agents des services secrets américains dans le sillage d'Ivanka Trump, arpentant les ruelles ; des policiers-plongeurs sillonnant le Grand Canal. Un niveau de sécurité digne du G20 accueilli par la ville en 2021, ou de la venue du pape François en 2024. Jeff Bezos, sa famille et ses 200 bons camarades, venus de toute la planète, aussi exposés que protégés pour les trois jours de festivités inscrits à leur programme. Plus qu'un mariage, c'est un événement où chaque détail révèle la nouvelle géographie du pouvoir et du glamour ; c'était un convoi de destins qui se croisent et se recroisent dans le sillage du succès. Une caravane de l'élite, où chaque invité est une étoile de l'entrepreneuriat ou de Hollywood. La rencontre explosive de la tech et du glamour. Les noms qui résonnent sur la liste des 200 invités de Jeff Bezos ? Les paparazzis se sont régalés avec la famille Kardashian, l'acteur Orlando Bloom, la comédienne Sydney Sweeney, l'animatrice Oprah Winfrey, mais ils ne sont pas arrivés à coincer le chanteur Mick Jagger, pourtant présent, ou encore Leonardo DiCaprio sans son éternelle casquette... Mais il y avait tellement plus lourd sur la balance de la réussite, là incognito : le cofondateur de Microsoft Bill Gates, le génie de ChatGPT Sam Altman, le patron de JPMorgan Jamie Dimon, le président de News Corp (Wall Street Journal, The Times...)Lachlan Murdoch, le co-PDG de Netflix Ted Sarandos, le producteur de cinéma et de musique David Geffen, le roi Midas de la Silicon Valley Marc Andreessen, un cofondateur d'AirBnb... Inutile de préciser qu'il s'agit tous de multimilliardaires, des hyper-riches ; leur nom figure en bonne place dans le classement Forbesdes plus grandes fortunes du monde. "" Ces personnes sont capables de dépenser 100 000 euros en un jour. ""Daniele Minotto, vice-président de l'association des hôteliers de VeniseLes Européens, eux, se comptaient sur les doigts d'une main : le couturier Domenico Dolce, Xavier Niel (fondateur d'Iliad), Delphine Arnault (directrice générale de Dior), John Elkann, chef de la famille Agnelli (première actionnaire de Stellantis, de Ferrari, de The Economist...) et François-Henri Pinault (PDG de Kering et gérant d'Artémis, propriétaire du Point)étaient les seuls entrepreneurs de notre bon Vieux Continent à avoir leur rond de serviette. "" Dis-leur de venir à Venise "" Tous se connaissent, habitués à se fréquenter dans des événements business moins romantiques, comme à la conférence Sun Valley, dans l'Idaho, tous fermés aux journalistes et au public, sauf aux vedettes américaines du show-business. Comme s'il s'était produit, depuis une petite décennie, une OPA des starlettes sur cette sphère de la tech ou plutôt une fusion-acquisition entre ces deux univers. Ah, que Leonardo DiCaprio plaît à ces rois des affaires, lorsqu'il prend la parole lors de conférences sur les nouvelles technologies, comme il l'a fait pour JPMorgan en début d'année. Mais comment Jeff Bezos avec son épouse, Lauren, a-t-il bien pu préférer Venise pour ses noces, lui qui a au moins sept pied-à-terre aux États-Unis, dont trois sur l'île très privée d'Indian Creek, au large de Miami ? Ou même à Paris, où il a visité plusieurs maisons, sans jamais passer à l'acte d'achat... Chut, c'est le créateur de mode Domenico Dolce qui a joué les intermédiaires. "" Quand il m'a dit qu'ils cherchaient une ville, je lui ai répondu : ""Dis-leur de venir à Venise"" "",reconnaît le maire, Luigi Brugnaro, interrogé parLe Point. Et voilà, au bout d'un an et demi de préparatifs, après surtout la signature du contrat de mariage entre Bezos et sa seconde épouse - un document si épais qu'il est appelé "" constitution "", listant biens et règles en cas de séparation -, la cité des Doges, ses artisans, ses hôteliers... empochaient la modique somme de 22 millions d'euros. Peu, face aux 217 milliards de fortune professionnelle de Jeff Bezos ? Luigi Brugnaro en convient, mais il se félicite des 3 millions versés par l'Américain à trois associations locales - 1 million pour chacune - et précise, sans rire : "" Bezos est une personnalité qui, grâce à ses compétences, avec son entourage, suscite un intérêt économique tout à fait exceptionnel. Lorsqu'il reviendra à Venise, nous lui présenterons différentes opportunités d'investissement et des partenariats possibles. ""Invitation par SMSIl est tôt, ce jeudi 26 juin, quand nous poussons la grande porte en bois du majestueux palais Giustinian-Brandolini, appartenant à une famille patricienne (les Brandolini d'Adda), dont la propriétaire, que l'on croise, est née Agnelli (Cristiana, soeur de Gianni, et grand-tante de John Elkann). Diane de Furstenberg et Barry Diller louent un des étages : l'icône de la mode rentre chez elle... La veille, le couple s'était régalé d'un dîner à domicile, avec les Bezos, leurs enfants et le père de Jeff. Le tour du pâté de maisons se poursuit. Un coucou, cette fois, au benjamin de cette copropriété de luxe : Marcantonio Brandolini apparaît pieds nus dans la cour. Il est à la tête d'une entreprise spécialisée dans les verres de Murano, Laguna B, qui concocte une surprise pour les invités du mariage des Bezos, mais il ne peut rien nous dévoiler, NDA (accord de non-divulgation) oblige. Les invités, eux, n'avaient signé aucun contrat de confidentialité, mais après avoir reçu leur invitation par SMS, il leur a été gentiment demandé de laisser leur portable de côté lors des trois soirées au programme, afin d'éviter les clichés "" hors de contrôle "" et de placer, un peu plus encore, les festivités sous cloche. L'"" Homme de Vitruve "" à l'Académie N'empêche, certains n'ont pas résisté à se mettre en scène.

Looking back, it's been one of the best decisions of my life. This year in the MSc Marketing program at HEC Paris was everything I hoped for from the #1 program in the world: a wild ride full of once-in-a-lifetime experiences, top-notch learning, and the most inspiring people. Working with leading global companies like Amazon, Parfums Christian Dior, L'Oréal (La Roche-Posay Laboratoire Dermatologique), McKinsey & Company, Sanofi, DDB, Westfield, and Veepee gave me the chance to tackle real business challenges and drive meaningful impact. These experiences reshaped the way I think about marketing. Beyond theory, it's about creating strategies that deliver tangible results and connect with people on a deeper level. Thank you Gachoucha Kretz, PhD and Marion BOUYOU for making this program such a transformational learning expedition. I'm truly grateful for everything I've gained from this experience. And of course, grateful beyond words to HEC Imagine, Adrien Nussenbaum, Agnes Tourneix and Alexandre Commergnat for this life-changing opportunity. Can't wait for a new journey to begin soon 💼✨"

En este contexto, se registraron importantes movimientos entre los multimillonarios más poderosos del planeta. El gran ganador del mes fue Larry Ellison, quien escaló al segundo lugar del ranking tras un salto del 32% en las acciones de Oracle. En el otro extremo, Elon Musk sufrió la mayor pérdida patrimonial del mes, aunque logró mantener el liderazgo. 10.

Bajo su liderazgo, Nvidia se consolidó como una pieza clave en el desarrollo de inteligencia artificial, con sus chips siendo utilizados en centros de datos, modelos generativos y plataformas en la nube. 9. Bernard Arnault Fortuna: USD 138.400 millones Fuente: LVMH (lujo y moda) El magnate francés continúa siendo el europeo más rico del mundo, aunque perdió USD 5.000 millones en junio debido a la desaceleración de las ventas en Asia y EE.

Once again, at this year's Wimbledon tournament, the only thing distracting from the tennis is the court-side style. “Wimbledon has turned the stands into a catwalk, and I am here for it,” says model and presenter Leomie Anderson, who is covering Wimbledon as Clearpay's fashion expert this season. If recent years saw guests erring on the side of safe – quiet luxury defined by demure dresses, boxy blazers and the occasional fascinator – 2025 has shifted gear. “There's a real shift happening,” Anderson explains, “people used to play it safe with blazers, midi dresses, the usual suspects. But this year, the crowd is serving. It's like everyone got the memo that Wimbledon is just as much a style moment as it is a sport.” And the stats back her up. Broderie anglaise is booming – with maxi dresses up 147%, skirts up 33% – hats are having a high-fashion renaissance with floppy styles up 99%, and butter-yellow is surging according to Clearpay. The best celebrity looks managed to balance their personality with a playful nod to the tournament's stereotypes – from Wimbledon whites to strawberries and cream. “There's something powerful about its simplicity, the traditions – the setting, the subtlety,” says Anderson. “People know they have to bring their A-game.” Here are some of the best-dressed celebrities at the tournament so far and how they aced Wimbledon style. Olivia Rodrigo A masterstroke in edging up tradition, singer Olivia Rodrigo, 22, wore a red gingham shirt dress by Ralph Lauren from the spring/summer 2000 archive – a playful nod to Wimbledon's iconic strawberries and cream. Her boyfriend, Louis Partridge, 22, coordinated in a red striped tie and navy blazer. Following her headlining performance at Glastonbury Festival on Sunday, Rodrigo managed to nail the elusive balance of British heritage and Gen Z irreverence. Anna and Michael Murray Also sticking to Wimble classics was retail tycoon and CEO of Frasers Group, Michael Murray, who went traditional in a linen white suit, a cream Panama and brown suede loafers. His wife Anna wore the print of the season in a tulle black and white polka dot midi dress, with black suede pumps and black leather Birkin. Cate Blanchett Actress Cate Blanchett, 56, stood out on Centre Court in a pearlescent Prince of Wales check suit by Giorgio Armani. Sharply tailored but soft in palette, it was a classic Blanchett power move, turning heads without the noise. “Cate's baby blue tartan suit was effortless and elegant,” Anderson puts it, “that classic tailoring is signature Cate cool.” Leslie Mann Wimbledon whites are a fail-safe style to sport year after year. While they run the risk of becoming repetitive and – dare I say – boring; when styled right with interesting cuts, whites can be as elegant as ever. Actress Leslie Mann, 53, appeared on day three in an ivory Dior bar jacket and delicate lace skirt. The look was reminiscent of the Princess of Wales recent Self Portrait ensemble at the Order of the Garter in June. David Beckham One thing more certain than spotting a cream Panama hat in the Wimbledon stands is spotting David Beckham. The 50-year-old former footballer once again brought off-court elegance in a cream silk-linen suit from his own Boss collaboration, finished with a chocolate brown tie. The only fashion blunder was plaster cast on his right arm – though even that couldn't detract from his summer suiting credentials. Dominic Cooper Unlike Beckham, 47 year-old actor Dominic Cooper opted out of the classic Wimbledon look and sported a bright powder blue suit with matching trainers. “I'm seeing bold colour choices […] and people leaning into what makes their style unique,” says Anderson of the look. Cooper reminded us that co-ordination doesn't have to mean stiff – and tonal can be a statement when done right. Tom Daley Dusky teal was Olympic diver Tom Daley's shade of choice – cool and contemporary and a refreshing break from Wimbledon white. Daley, 31, paired the Paul Smith suit with a Christian Louboutin clutch and a Chopard watch. Judy Murray Mother to former Wimbledon champion Sir Andy Murray, Judy Murray chose a sunshine-yellow Me+Em dress with white platform trainers. The cheerful dress was bang on trend, with butter yellow emerging as the summer's sleeper hit...."

From the very first day, we were immersed in a culture of excellence. We were encouraged by industry leaders and inspiring speakers to think boldly, communicate with purpose, and push the boundaries of what we believed possible. Throughout the program, I had the opportunity to work on real-world projects with some of the most influential names in the industry. We developed a 360° strategy for L'Oréal  La Roche-Posay Laboratoire Dermatologique, created a new fragrance concept for Parfums Christian Dior, reimagined Veepee's approach to Gen Z, crafted a sustainability narrative for Amazon  in collaboration with DDB  and tackled a strategic consulting case with McKinsey & Company, among others. We also attended thought-provoking conferences, including a particularly memorable session with Marc Chaya, CEO and Co-founder of Maison Francis Kurkdjian, which left a lasting impression on me. Beyond the projects and events, I explored new fields, refined critical skills, and experienced meaningful personal and professional growth. This was made possible thanks to the dedication of our professors and the collaboration of brilliant classmates who made the experience truly exceptional. I am especially grateful to our Program Director, Gachoucha Kretz, PhD, and Program Manager, Marion BOUYOU, whose leadership and support shaped the quality of this journey. Their clear vision, thoughtful mentorship, and ongoing encouragement provided the structure and motivation that will continue to guide me well beyond HEC. The year concluded with a study trip to London, where we visited the HEC in the UK office and engaged with inspiring teams at Puig  EssilorLuxottica  and Netflix This milestone marks the end of an extraordinary journey and the beginning of an exciting new chapter✨ #HECParis #Graduation #Marketing #Master #HECAlumni #LearnToDare"

Email tips@dailymail.com Abbey Clancy's daughter Sophia showed she has taken after her model mother as she joined her famous family and footballer father Peter Crouch at the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club for day four of Wimbledon on Thursday. The daughter to the famous couple, 14, showed off her resemblance to her mother as she was seen topping up her lip gloss in the crowd. She joined Abbey, 39, and Peter, 44, who looked happier than ever and packed on the PDA with a kiss while sat in Centre Court, as she stepped out in an all white ensemble. For the outing, Sophie put on a very glamorous display as she toted her belongings around in a black leather Miu Miu bag. It appears that she also has her mother's eye for designer accessories, as she accessorised with four Christian Dior cloth bracelets, each worth a whopping £250. To finish her sporting day outfit, Sophia was seen wearing false eyelashes as she applied a layer of Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip gloss. Meanwhile Abbey - who is also a mother to Liberty, nine, Johnny, seven, and Jack, five - looked incredible for the outing as she wore a yellow striped suit. Liverpool football legend Peter, looked handsome as he attended the event in a casual blue shirt. Abbey has had a highly successful modelling career, while she's also branched out into presenting, novel writing and even won Strictly Come Dancing back in 2013. And Sophia has taken nepotism in her stride as she made her modelling debut aged eight when she joined Abbey for a Lipsy shoot. Sophia has reportedly had 'loads of offers' already from agencies as she is being dubbed the 'next Lila Moss' A source told Heat World: 'Sophia is getting lots of offers from modelling agencies. They see her as the next big thing, thanks to her looking like Abbey and having Pete's height. 'She has already done campaigns with her mum, but now big-name agencies are desperate to sign her and turn her into the next Lila Moss.' Centre Court spectators will be watching Jack Draper compete against 2017 Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic and Dan Evans takes on Novak Djokovic. Draper, the current world No4, takes on 2017 Wimbledon finalist Marin Cilic this afternoon as he looks to progress past the second round for the first time at SW19. World number one Jannik Sinner is also back in the spotlight, up against Aleksandar Vukic, whilst Iga Swiatek plays Caty McNally in the other Centre Court match. Judy Murray has opened up on the secrets of the Royal Box at Wimbledon as celebrity guests continue to flood into Wimbledon. While there are 18 Championship grass courts at SW19, all eyes are often on the historic Centre Court, which plays host to the best stars the sport has to offer as they compete for glory. Centre Court boasts nearly 15,000 seats, meaning lucky punters can be seen cheering on their favourites, and are joined by guests in the Royal Box at around lunchtime each day. So far this week, the likes of John Cena, Thomas Tuchel and Olivia Rodrigo have all been present, with all three part of a star-studded line-up in the Box on Wednesday. On Tuesday Judy, renown for her coaching work in the sport and her support for tennis-playing sons Andy and Jamie, made an appearance. Before her trip, she opened up on what it is like in the Royal Box on The Chris Evans Breakfast Show with The National Lottery on Virgin Radio UK. 'Royal Boxing should be a verb, shouldn't it?' she said.' It should be a summer verb.' She added: 'Well, you arrive usually around 11.30, so you go upstairs, they have a champagne reception, then you go in for lunch and you could be sitting beside absolutely anybody at lunch. There's no seating plan, it's just as you go into the room. 'It's in the clubhouse of the All England Club, and the first year that I went I took my mum, of course, and we sat with Jack Nicklaus. I sat with a few years ago a lady who was the first female Spitfire pilot. I mean it's just you could be with absolutely anybody and the stories are fascinating. 'It's really tough when the sun comes round because there's no escape. 'It's actually I think worse for the guys because they have to wear a jacket and tie and they're not allowed to take the jacket off unless the royalty in the box takes their jacket off first. That's the protocol.'"

The 30-second video, photographed and directed by Stevie Dance and styled by Anna Trevelyan, follows the storyline of an underground collector tracking down the coveted accessory. The original Spy Bag was launched by Silvia Venturini Fendi in 2005 and quickly became a defining accessory of the 2000s. The signature design now returns, 20 years after its original release. Spy Bags, both original and new, feature a plush silhouette, twisted handles, and secret compartments that offer privacy in style. The new iteration boasts a few contemporary updates that brings the feeling of Y2K to 2025. Donatella Versace, who announced she would be stepping down from her position as Chief Creative Officer early this spring, launched her final ad campaign this week, starring veteran muses Kate Moss, Kristen McMenamy, Amber Valletta, Natasha Poly, and Claudia Schiffer, as well as newer faces like Anok Yai and Mica Argañaraz. The images and retro video clip feature Donatella's final Fall 2025 collection, and was shot by long-time collaborators Mert & Marcus. Former Miu Miu creative director Dario Vitale will succeed Donatella and stage his debut Versace show in September. The campaign symbolized a passing of the torch to Vitale, honoring the Versace of the past while also celebrating what's to come. “It was all about friendship, loyalty, and love. Every collection is a story, and this campaign is the story of Versace. Inspiring the present and anticipating the future,” Donatella said in a statement.

As a womenswear editor, I rarely ventured into menswear, but Jonathan Anderson's debut collection for Dior at Men's Fashion Week in Paris has sparked my curiosity. In his first runway show for the house, where he now serves as creative director of both menswear and womenswear, Anderson offered a fresh take on formality laced with a casual ease. Suddenly, I'm considering candy-colored chinos and cable-knit sweaters, cargo pants in innovative new proportions, and even the possibility of a floral or silk moiré vest. Anderson layered the most impeccable crisp blue cotton poplins under knit capes. And his version of pajama dressing was polished enough to wear far beyond the bedroom. The men's shows were full of inspiration. At Prada, striped knits made a graphic statement—bold, unexpected, full of energy and intent. Meanwhile, at Saint Laurent, Anthony Vaccarello offered a color story I can't stop thinking about, with cherry, mustard, rust, and aubergine nonchalantly mixed. It's an unexpected combination that somehow feels exactly right. Julian Klausner's sarong at Dries Van Noten emerged as a new proposition—not just for the beach, but as a stylish, unexpected piece in everyday dressing. So yes, I want that perfect blue poplin striped shirt, neatly tucked into a belted paper-bag pant. I want a piped pajama shirt that's elevated enough for the office—and the perfect pink chinos too. Menswear this season isn't about old, gendered notions of dressing. It's about dressing with purpose and polish, while celebrating a fresh, unexpected mix of possibilities. The blue striped poplin shirt steps out of the basics pile and into the spotlight. Classic cargo pants return, reshaped with new volume, structure, and runway precision. Colors collide in this season's most surprising palette. Classic tailoring gets refreshed with sharply defined collars in contrasting colors and textures. The contrast-piped pajama shirt goes from sleepwear to boardroom with effortless elegance. Knits get graphic with unapologetically oversized stripes and playful palettes. The sarong gets recast as a wrapped, everyday essential—not just for the beach. Soft shades meet strong silhouettes—pastels never looked this confident."

「下班趕著去健身房運動，但是帶妝運動對皮膚不好⋯」大家都知道，運動後的汗水跟高體溫，會讓肌膚毛細孔張開，這個時候如果帶妝運動，毛孔就會被顆粒阻塞。 因此有些人會在運動前卸妝，避免傷害皮膚，但是這其中有什麼迷思呢？ ELLE在這訪問到皮膚科醫生，究竟帶妝運動會對肌膚造成什麼影響？ 又該如何選擇卸妝產品？ 一起來看看！ 「睡覺」也能消耗熱量？ 專家提3關鍵決定睡眠時燃燒多少卡路里，想躺著瘦要從睡好開始
帶妝運動為何可能傷肌膚？ COPYRIGHT: 
皮膚科顧問和英國皮膚基金會發言人Anjali Mahto醫生說： 「理想情況下，最好避免化妝到健身房運動。」 運動帶來的汗水和體溫升高會導致毛孔張開，而毛孔就會被化妝品顆粒堵塞。 這很容易導致爆痘，也會讓皮膚紋理不均勻。 另外，一般平均來說，人在一小時內會摸到自己的臉大概3.6次，而流汗時就會增加次數。 在運動時手腳在接觸瑜珈墊、自行車把手和重訓器材後又摸到臉，更會導致皮膚痤瘡。 化妝去運動究竟會不會使肌膚加速老化？ COPYRIGHT: 
所以，我們砸大錢買精華液、保濕來保養自己的皮膚，只要帶妝上健身房，就全都功虧一簣了嗎？ Mahto醫生表示：「這不一定。 身體對運動產生的自然生理反應，是產生汗水和熱量，即使帶妝運動會引起痘痘問題，但也沒有證據表明這樣會導致加速或過早老化。」 運動時忽略「防曬」才是大忌！ COPYRIGHT: 
以長遠來看，雖然帶妝運動可能不會對皮膚造成傷害，但如果在室外運動就要特別注意了。 Mahto醫生提醒大家，選擇防曬乳的防曬係數SPF非常重要。 這可以防止受到陽光帶來的肌膚傷害、皮膚癌和皮膚過早老化。 而比起化學防曬劑，礦物防曬霜可能對皮膚更好，尤其是如果你很容易痤瘡或有其他皮膚上的問題。 但是，如果是那些喜歡使用化學防曬劑的人來說，那麼凝膠狀配方可能比乳霜更好。 卸妝品怎麼挑？ 醫生提醒「這類型」卸妝少用
COPYRIGHT: 
市面上不少品牌推出油性卸妝產品，但Mahto醫生說，最好是再去健身房前，避免使用這些產品。 「除非你的皮膚非常乾燥、敏感，否則我不建議使用油性的卸妝產品。 很多油性產品是導致許多粉刺，甚至黑頭形成的原因。」 清潔肌膚的方式會對皮膚健康產生重大影響。 雖然在去健身房卸妝是一個好主意，但需要明確的掌握清潔方式。 過度洗淨只會導致乾燥、敏感和刺激。 不需要雙重清潔。 選對潔顏品也是養成好膚質關鍵！ COPYRIGHT: 
護膚專家Rosula Chapman也表示同意：「我建議溫和清潔。 含有乙醇酸的溫和泡沫或凝膠卸妝產品能更有效地去除化妝品和皮脂，同時還能使皮膚更光滑柔嫩，不會造成乾燥。」 面部護理師Sophie Ace則說：「去角質也有助於卸妝。 如果你的毛孔容易被堵塞，這些輕質的酸性產品會分解皮脂並阻止肌膚發炎。」 早上喝咖啡還是下午喝咖啡才健康？ 科學家揭露喝咖啡的最佳時機，喝對可以降低中風率並增進長壽

Muchas personas usan el término “perfume” para referirse a cualquier fragancia, pero no todas tienen la misma concentración ni duración. Las diferencias entre un perfume, un eau de parfum y un eau de toilette no solo radican en su nombre, sino también en su composición, intensidad y uso recomendado. Conocer estas variaciones es clave para elegir la opción más adecuada según el estilo de vida, el clima y el presupuesto. En el mercado mexicano, existe una amplia oferta que incluye desde marcas internacionales de alta gama hasta opciones accesibles y funcionales. Cada formato tiene sus ventajas dependiendo del contexto: si se busca una fragancia duradera para un evento especial, o algo más fresco y liviano para el día a día. Comprender estas diferencias ayuda a evitar errores comunes, cómo comprar una fragancia demasiado intensa para el uso diario. Este artículo detalla las particularidades de cada tipo de producto, presenta ejemplos representativos y ofrece recomendaciones prácticas para encontrar la fragancia ideal, ya sea de firmas de lujo o de marcas populares como los perfumes Aeropostale, Calvin Klein, Zara o Tous. Diferencias fundamentales entre las concentraciones Cada tipo de fragancia tiene una formulación distinta que influye directamente en su duración y proyección. ¿Qué es un perfume? El perfume o extrait de parfum es el formato más concentrado. Su contenido de aceites esenciales suele estar entre el 20 % y el 30 %, lo que le confiere una duración prolongada, a veces superior a 12 horas en la piel. Este tipo de fragancia es más costosa, pero también más persistente y sofisticada. Ejemplos comunes de perfumes concentrados incluyen Chanel No. 5 Extrait, Dior J'adore L'Absolu o Amouage Interlude Woman. Por su intensidad, se recomienda aplicarlos con moderación y reservarlos para eventos especiales o climas fríos, donde pueden desplegar todo su potencial sin resultar abrumadores. ¿Qué es un eau de parfum? El eau de parfum (EDP) es uno de los formatos más populares por su equilibrio entre duración y precio. Su concentración oscila entre el 15 % y el 20 %, lo que permite una fijación duradera de 6 a 8 horas, dependiendo del tipo de piel y las condiciones ambientales. Marcas como Yves Saint Laurent Libre, Carolina Herrera Good Girl, Montblanc Signature o los perfumes Aeropostale en su versión EDP son buenos ejemplos de esta categoría. Estas fragancias son ideales para el uso diario en ambientes cerrados o para quienes desean un aroma que permanezca durante toda la jornada. ¿Qué es un eau de toilette? El eau de toilette (EDT) contiene entre un 5 % y un 15 % de aceites aromáticos. Esto la convierte en una opción más ligera, con una duración que va de 3 a 5 horas. Es perfecta para climas cálidos, momentos casuales o como fragancia de reaplicación a lo largo del día. Algunos EDT populares son CK One, Versace Pour Femme Dylan Blue, Tous Touch o Light Blue de Dolce & Gabbana en su versión ligera. Son recomendables para quienes prefieren aromas sutiles y frescos que no invadan el espacio personal. Aplicaciones prácticas según el estilo de vida Cada formato responde a un tipo de uso diferente, según la ocasión y la rutina personal. Fragancias para el trabajo y el día a día Para entornos laborales o actividades cotidianas, el eau de toilette suele ser la mejor elección. Su ligereza evita que el aroma resulte molesto para los demás, y su frescura aporta una sensación de limpieza. También es común reaplicar este tipo de fragancia a lo largo del día sin saturar. Marcas como Zara, Burberry Weekend, Benetton Colors, o los perfumes Aeropostale presentan opciones adecuadas para este perfil de uso, especialmente en oficinas o ambientes escolares. Fragancias para eventos especiales Cuando se necesita una fragancia más notoria y duradera, como en bodas, cenas o reuniones nocturnas, lo ideal es optar por un perfume o un buen eau de parfum. Estas versiones logran mayor permanencia y proyección, creando una estela más distintiva. Algunas recomendaciones incluyen Lancome La Vie Est Belle, Tom Ford Black Orchid, Mugler Alien o Elie Saab Le Parfum. Estos productos se comportan bien en pieles secas o en climas templados. Cómo identificar el tipo de concentración Es clave revisar la etiqueta y los detalles del envase antes de comprar una fragancia. Qué buscar en la botella o caja Los productos suelen indicar claramente si se trata de un perfume, eau de parfum o eau de toilette. Estas leyendas aparecen junto al nombre de la fragancia, por lo general en francés. En caso de duda, también se puede consultar el porcentaje de concentración en la lista de ingredientes. Además, algunas marcas ofrecen el mismo aroma en diferentes concentraciones. Por ejemplo, Chanel Coco Mademoiselle tiene versiones tanto EDP cómo EDT, cada una con una estructura olfativa ligeramente distinta, pero fiel al ADN del perfume. Consideraciones al comprar en línea Cuando se adquiere una fragancia por internet, especialmente en tiendas mexicanas como Liverpool, Sears, Sanborns o Amazon México, es fundamental verificar la descripción del producto...."

L'incident, révélé après que Vogue a profilé la somptueuse garde-robe de la mariée, a été confirmée par la suite par le -, qui a rapporté que Sánchez a décrit la robe comme «celle qui s'est échappée» et ne sait toujours pas où elle s'est terminée. Une garde-robe faite pour un mariage d'une semaine L'ancien ancre de télévision et pilote d'hélicoptère a commandé 27 robes pour les célébrations de mariage, qui se sont déroulées sur plusieurs jours fin juin sur l'île de Majorque. Bien que le couple s'est officiellement marié lors d'une cérémonie privée à bord de 394 millions de livres sterling de Bezos (500 millions de dollars) Yacht Koru, les festivités ont duré plusieurs emplacements et thèmes. Sánchez aurait travaillé avec des maisons de mode de renommée mondiale, notamment Dolce & Gabbana, Dior, Valentino et Schiaparelli. Chaque look a été conçu pour correspondre à une partie spécifique de la célébration, des dîners avant le mariage aux rassemblements de yachts post-cérémonie. Mais malgré une planification méticuleuse, l'une des robes n'est jamais arrivée. La robe manquante a disparu en transit. Bien que Sánchez n'ait pas identifié le designer, elle l'a appelé «un mystère» et a dit: «Peut-être que ce n'était pas censé être». L'absence n'a pas fait dérailler les célébrations mais a ajouté une tournure inattendue à ce qui était autrement une affaire étroitement chorégraphiée. Une liste d'invités et un budget pour correspondre Le mariage, qui a eu lieu le week-end du 22 juin 2025, était tout sauf petit. Le coût global aurait dépassé 15,7 millions de livres sterling (20 millions de dollars), couvrant tout, de la restauration de luxe au transport et à la sécurité des jets privés. Les invités comprenaient un who's who de la célébrité et de la royauté du monde technologique. Barbra Streisand, Oprah Winfrey, Kris Jenner et Bill Gates auraient tous été présents. Les participants ont été transportés entre les événements via l'hélicoptère, les convois de SUV privés et la flotte personnelle de Bezos. Le couple a loué un domaine du XVIe siècle dans les montagnes de Deià et a accueilli plusieurs rassemblements en plus de la cérémonie elle-même. Les installations florales, les menus sur mesure et la vaisselle des concepteurs auraient fait partie de l'expérience. Malgré sa taille, Sánchez a décrit le mariage dans son interview Vogue comme «intime et sacrée», une phrase qui a attiré des réactions mitigées en ligne. Une robe de mariée devient un sujet de discussion La nouvelle de la robe manquante, bien que mineure dans le contexte d'un événement aussi massif, est rapidement devenue symbolique de l'échelle et de l'excès entourant la célébration. La garde-robe de 27-durée de Sánchez, combinée à la liste des invités somptueuses et à un cadre exotique, a été considéré par certains comme emblématique de l'extravagance milliardaire. Les commentaires en ligne allaient de l'envie légère aux critiques plus nettes. Certains utilisateurs de médias sociaux ont décrit la situation comme un «problème milliardaire à laquelle personne d'autre ne pouvait se rapporter», tandis que d'autres se sont concentrés sur la logistique du stockage et du transport d'un nombre aussi élevé de robes de couture pour un week-end. Sánchez, cependant, semblait imperturbable. Sa citation, «Peut-être que ce n'était pas censé être», livrée en riant, semblait résumer son attitude: élégante mais non botrée. Un mariage fait pour se souvenir Qu'il s'agisse du cadre de superyacht, de la garde-robe rotative ou de la robe de designer manquante, le mariage Bezos – Sánchez a déjà cimenté sa place dans les titres culturels de 2025. Le couple, fiancé depuis 2023, est au centre de la fascination publique depuis des années, non seulement pour leur richesse mais aussi pour leur style de vie très visible et leurs efforts philanthropiques. Et tandis que la plupart des mariages ont un hoquet ou deux, dans celui-ci, une robe manquante pourrait être le détail le plus sur la marque de tous."

1lr893b,2025-07-04 03:04:24,en,REDDIT,"  Hey everyone! Just wanted to take a moment to thank this amazing community, you've all helped me so much over the past few months. The passion, knowledge, and honest feedback here really guided me through my fragrance journey. In the last 4 months, I went all in tried over 150+ decants, visited a few local perfumeries, and explored and owned tons of perfume oils beyond what I'm sharing in this post. After a lot of research (and a bit of obsession), I ended up collecting these fragrances, and let's just say… it became quite the addiction! That said, I've decided to hit pause and not buy any more fragrances for the rest of the year (with one exception that might arrive in the next couple of days). I'll still be around and happy to help anyone here however I can. Thanks again for being such a great part of this journey! **Note**: I am not an expert , I trust my nose more than reviews, please do research or test fragrances before you buy, I am from Middle east / Asia English is not my native language, I apologize in advance for any mistakes i try to explain this in my words without using any AI or correction tool. I am reviewing all fragrances after giving them time to mature. From Top Left to Right: 1. **Icon by Dunhill**: Really Good citrusy, Aromatic and floral scent. A good alternative for those who don't like sweet or overly citrusy scents for summer. 2. **1 Million Prive:** The most complimented one on my list, absolutely amazing winter scent with sweet and tobacco notes; I failed to find anything that can beat that fragrance. 3. **1 Million Elixir:** Very sweet and creamy vanilla with colorful floral tones, especially on the dry down. Lasts a long time and projection is strong. **4. **   **Jasoor:** Clone of VUBIR Coral Fantasy Long Lasting with Good projection, Very Versatile for year-round wear except very hot evenings. **5. **   **Asad Bourbon:** Clone that covers VUBIR Intense, Most Wanted and Stronger with you. Smells cozy and rich. Feels confident and warm. **6. **   **Khamrah :** Amazing Scent, Sweet,  Warm , Cozy with Vanilla and amber. 7. **Khamrah Dukhan:** I tried Liquid Burn, and to my nose, it smells quite similar that same warm, spicy DNA. But Khamrah Dukhan was much cheaper, so I went for it. It's incredibly long-lasting and feels like a spicier, less sweet version of Khamrah. If the sweetness in the original Khamrah isn't your thing, this might be a better fit. Honestly, it's underrated and didn't get the recognition it deserves from early buyers or reviewers. This one needs more attention, it's a hidden gem. 8. **Alpine Homme Sport**: Clone of Allure Homme Sport, as a Sporty scent both last 4-5 hours, and it's enough for a sports session, very good gym scent. 9. **CDN Precieux:** Clone of Aventus Absolu with Twist, Great performance and quality scent better and smoother when compared with Supremacy CE but costs more and feel more expensive **10. ** **Mont Blanc Starwalker:** absolute masterpiece a good night time / bedtime scent. Calming and relaxing, Hyped for a reason very unique scent. **11. ** **Dunhill Desire for a man:** Apple, Citrus and Rose based scent, classic cheap summer scent suitable for any age. 12. **L'Homme by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of L'Homme Lacoste, long lasting, sweet, citrusy fresh scent. FD is a small local perfumery in my area. 13. **L'Homme Intense by Fragrance Deluxe**: Clone of Dior Homme Intense, Dior Homme intense clones were mostly sold out and its hard to get them in my country so i visited a local perfumery where they had this clone its using same french oils used by other clone houses. I tried it it was very long lasting so i bought the bottle, during testing it last 12+ hours on my skin. 14...."

Or when you're obsessed with the quirky monster doll, Labubu, that everyone on social media seems to own? For some, the answer is simple: don't buy it. But for others - especially those stubborn, brand-loving souls - Indian markets have found a workaround. If you can't get the first copy, just buy the fifth one. And no, these aren't dupes with witty name changes or altered packaging. These are full-blown counterfeits: same branding, identical packaging, but at a mere fraction of the price. We took a deep dive into these murky online markets to find out what's being sold, how they are being sold, and more importantly, why so many people are buying them. But before we unpack all that, let's rewind a bit. The Rise Of India's Counterfeit Culture Counterfeit goods aren't new in India. They've existed in various forms for decades. When globalisation opened the floodgates to international brands, a majority of Indians found themselves unable to afford the real thing. The demand was high, but supply (at least the genuine kind) was out of reach. Naturally, the market responded in its own cheeky way. Think of places like D'manoj Pizza knocking off Domino's. Even when Domino's caught wind of the viral video of their doppelganger, their response was just as cheeky: ""Yahan ka address milega? (Can we get the address?)"" (Not a copyright claim) Today, that spirit has spilled across industries, from fast food to fashion to beauty. Markets like Sarojini Nagar in Delhi, Esplanade in Kolkata and Linking Road in Mumbai are prime examples, brimming with off-brand versions of luxury items. These IRL knock-offs often tweak a letter here, a logo there, or at least get the shade of lipstick slightly off. For beauty products though, the compromises run deeper - especially when it comes to ingredients and safety. But the game has changed online. Unlike the local bazaar, where, you know you're buying a knock-off, e-commerce marketplaces and social media are now peddling products that look identical to the original. Meesho, Facebook Marketplace, Amazon, Instagram... everyone is on it, and everyone is in on it. How These Fake Markets Operate Meesho Meesho is notorious (and simultaneously beloved) for offering bargain-basement prices. The brand claims this is possible because it eliminates middlemen, connects resellers directly to manufacturers, and focuses on lesser-known brands. But this has created the perfect breeding ground for fake products - especially viral beauty items. Take Hailey Bieber's Rhode lip treatment, for instance. Not officially available in India, but somehow being sold on Meesho for less than Rs 500. We even found fake Dior and Gisou lip oils, sold in nearly identical packaging but with slightly altered names. Facebook Marketplace It might not be trending in urban Gen Z circles, but Facebook Marketplace (FMP) is still massive. With over a billion global users shopping every month, it's a hotspot for everything from houseplants to handbags - and now, counterfeit beauty products in India. It's not just about fake luxury either. Some sellers offer bizarrely cheap prices for products that shouldn't even be in India, let alone available at that price. The sheer scale of the platform makes it easy for scamsters to thrive with little scrutiny. Instagram Instagram, Meta's glamorous baby, has become a thriving hub for small business sellers, even in India. Unfortunately, many of them are hawking knock-off makeup and skincare products via Reels. Some don't even bother to change the names-they rely on flashy visuals and discounted prices to hook unsuspecting users. The perfume industry is especially saturated with counterfeit sellers offering half-price on these bottles that may look legit but aren't even close. Insta pages selling perfumes like Dior Sauvage at extremely low price - Beware byu/Pennywise0704 inDesiFragranceAddicts Flipkart And Amazon Even the giants aren't immune to this ailment...."

En un mundo donde la economía está en constante movimiento y con mercados que experimentan una volatilidad sin precedentes, la lista de las personas más ricas del planeta se ha convertido en un reflejo del poder e influencia de ciertos individuos. Según la iconográfica revista Forbes, estos multimillonarios no solo destacan por su exorbitante riqueza, sino también por los imperios que han construido. 1) Elon Musk Patrimonio neto: 406.500 millones de dólares Fuente: Tesla, SpaceX, xAI, X Edad: 53 Residencia: Austin, Texas Ciudadanía: Estados Unidos Aunque perdió 16.000 millones de dólares en junio por la caída del 8% en las acciones de Tesla, Musk se mantiene como la persona más rica del mundo. Es el director ejecutivo de Tesla y la empresa de cohetes SpaceX, presidente y director de tecnología de la red social X - anteriormente conocida como Twitter -, y fundador del startup de inteligencia artificial xAI, valorada en 80.000 millones de dólares según estimaciones privadas. 2) Larry Ellison Patrimonio neto: 262.2 mil millones de dólares Fuente: Oracle Edad: 80 Residencia: Woodside, California Ciudadanía: Estados Unidos Ellison es uno de los impulsores del Proyecto Stargate, anunciado por Donald Trump.

Su boda, valorada en 50 millones de euros, demuestra que ni siquiera uno de los hombres más ricos del mundo puede comprarlo todo. La coyuntura de esta boda de Lauren Sánchez y Jeff Bezos no puede ser más cósmica: quién podía imaginar que los dos emperadores de Estados Unidos, el presidente Donald Trump y el propietario de Amazon, Jeff Bezos, pisarían el mismo suelo europeo en la misma semana. El primero acudió a La Haya para poner patas arriba la Cumbre de la OTAN en la que, según cuentan los análisis, casi todos le dieron a razón para que no cogiera una rabieta. El segundo ha querido casarse en la bella Venecia, parapetado en hoteles de siete estrellas y rodeado por marines disfrazados de guardaespaldas. Y una lista VIP estratosférica de invitadas con Rania de Jordania a la cabeza. Contemplar a estos dos hombres en acción es fascinante: tanto a Trump, creyendo que doblega con sus manotazos a los arteros diplomáticos europeos, como a Bezos, tirando besos y saludando como si fuera Beyoncé o Bad Bunny. Como si alguien le aclamara, vamos. Efectivamente, el emperador está desnudo y todas, al menos todas las que no hemos sido invitadas ni a la Cumbre de la OTAN ni a la boda en Venecia, podemos ver su ridiculez, más allá del maquillaje naranja de uno y la teatralidad extemporánea del otro. Pongamos algunas cifras encima de la mesa que suscriben la mejor teoría leída hasta la fecha acerca de esta gran ceremonia imperial de Bezos: «Esta boda 'chonea'», dictaminó el diseñador Juan Avellaneda, desde hace tiempo árbitro de la elegancia desde su perfil de Instagram. Avellaneda encuadró a muchas de las invitadas en el estilo 'choni', aunque quizá sin conocer demasiado bien la gracia plebeya y desparpajo popular de una verdadera choni de barrio. Lo que estamos viendo en Venecia no son chonis (ya quisieran). Son, sencillamente, millonarias desesperadas. Desesperadas por parecerse a Sofía Loren. Vamos con las cifras. Ya lo sabemos: Jeff Bezos se ha gastado alrededor de 50 millones de euros para regalarle a su novia, la presentadora de televisión Lauren Sánchez (ganadora de un Emmy en 1999), una boda para recordar. Y Venecia la recordará, de hecho, como la ceremonia más sucia que jamás vio la ciudad de los canales: nueve enormes yates fondearon en el abarrotado puerto y 90 aviones privados esperan en el aeropuerto Marco Polo para devolver a sus propietarios allá donde deseen. Jeff Bezos quiso cerrar para él el centro de Venecia     La ONG Consejo Internacional de Transporte Limpio ha calculado que generarán 5.000 toneladas de gases de efecto invernadero. Los novios pidieron a sus invitados que, en vez de regalos, hicieran donaciones a grupos ecologistas. Y, de hecho, muchos activistas han protestado de todas las maneras posibles por la irrupción de Bezos y Sánchez en Venecia y su intención de hacerse propietarios del lugar, cortando el tráfico aquí y allá, impidiendo el paso a los peatones, a golpe de talonario. Bezos ha logrado 'alquilar' Venecia solo en parte, pues se frustró su intención de casarse en un edificio histórico del centro de la ciudad. Tampoco tuvo suerte durante la esperada fiesta de la preboda del jueves: una tormenta bíblica hizo huir despavoridas y despeluchadas a las estrellas invitadas, que corrieron a sus lanchas para llegar a su hotel. Una venganza en toda regla de la Naturaleza que se celebró casi en cada hogar de la ciudad. Kim y Khloe Kardashian. GTRES     Pese a las protestas, los memes en las redes y el lema «No Kings No Bezos» ('No a los reyes, no a Bezos', una adaptación del grito anti Trump) proyectado con láser en la plaza de San Marcos, los novios no han dado muestras de captar el rechazo popular. Parece que la novia declaró lo siguiente en la noche del diluvio: «Estoy viviendo un cuento de hadas, estoy en el séptimo cielo en una ciudad maravillosa, con el hombre que amo. No podría ser más feliz». El alcalde sí que ha de estar feliz: calculó que el enlace entre Lauren Sánchez y Jeff Bezos podría generar un impacto económico total de unos 957 millones de euros, incluida una gigante campaña de publicidad. Algunos artesanos locales (porque los novios regalaron a sus invitados una pieza de cristalería de Murano y dulces de la confiteria Rosa Salva), empresas de taxis y las grandes cadenas de hoteles se llevarán su parte, pero muy poco de todo ese dinero irá a parar a los bolsillos de los vecinos que han soportado el evento. Lauren Sánchez lucirá una veintea de looks de lujo     Más números: se rumorea que Lauren Sánchez lucirá durante su estancia en Venecia 27 looks de alta costura, de los que de momento hemos visto un Schiaparelli apabullante. Al menos de frente, pues al ponerse de perfil el busto artificial de la novia deshace gran parte de su magia (Avellaneda dixit). ' The New York Times' publica que su estilista ha podido ser Anna Wintour, se supone que en su última comisión de servicio antes de abandonar la dirección de Vogue América, 37 años después. Suya pudo haber sido la idea de disfrazar a la novia de Jackie Kennedy con un look sesentero de Dior, horas antes de ponerse el traje de novia de Dolce & Gabbana. Pocos minutos después de que la novia dejara ver su vestido, Vogue lanzó en su website el reportaje del 'fitting' de Lauren Sánchez en el atelier de Dolce & Gabbana en Milán. «Me siento una princesa», exclamó al verse. Y desveló su inspiración, para sorpresa de nadie: el vestido de novia que lució Sofía Loren en 1958 para casarse con Cary Grant en la película Cintia (Houseboat). En la cena posterior, relata Vogue, la novia se puso un vestido inspirado en el que llevó Rita Hayworth en Gilda (1946). Y en la fiesta posterior, el protagonista fue un Oscar de la Renta con 175.000 cristales bordados. Ivanka Trump. GTRES     Si la preboda se celebró en los jardines de la iglesia del siglo XIV Madonna dell'Orto, con el clan Kardashian al completo imitando a Loren, Vitti o Bellucci sin ser nada de eso; la ceremonia tuvo lugar en el anfiteatro de mármol de la isla San Giorgio Maggiore, frente a la Plaza de San Marcos. Para esta cita, las invitadas VIP dieron el do de pecho del mal gusto. Aunque Jeff y Lauren pretendieron discreción para su enlace, las celebrities lucharon denodadamente por protagonizar la foto más viral gracias al look más desaforado. Las propuestas rosa de Ivanka Trump, Khloe Kardashian y Oprah Winfrey parecían salidas de los descartes de Barbie. Alicatadas con plumas, encajes y lentejuelas, debieron soportar más de 40 grados de calor los escasos minutos que pisaban las lanchas taxi. También sufrió la inclemencia veraniega Rania de Jordania, pero ella iba vestida con un Armani Privé de ensueño. Tras la ceremonia y cena, la gran fiesta final se celebrará hoy en el Arsenale, un enorme recinto fortificado que desde el siglo XII hasta la II Guerra Mundial se dedicó a la industria naval y militar con armerías y astilleros. El dress code exige máscaras del Settecento (el XVIII veneciano) y se rumorea, aunque nada puede confirmarse hasta que se produzca, que Lady Gaga y Elton John ofrecerán un concierto.

According to the fashion house, more than a million people followed the livestream of the fashion show, staged in a giant structure in front of the Hôtel des Invalides, home to Napoleon's tomb. In total, Dior achieved more than a billion views on social media, thanks to a communication campaign across 21 platforms in the run-up and aftermath of the June 27 display during men's fashion week in Paris. “The livestream of the show alone attracted over 200 million views, as did the two teaser videos featuring world football champion Kylian Mbappé,” according to Dior, sharing preliminary data with WWD. The full-court press around the show commenced with Andy Warhol's Polaroid of artist Jean-Michel Basquiat. Dior revealed the campaign first via an Instagram Story Close Friends activation, leaking the images to select editors and talents — whom Dior added to the Close Friends feature on Instagram. Before the show, whose opening look was a take on the Bar jacket paired with voluminously pleated cargo shorts, Dior broadcast a film depicting “The White Lotus” actor Sam Nivola in Versailles and guests — including Robert Pattinson — getting ready in their hotel rooms before arriving at the venue. As additional content, Dior released a podcast with Karen Binns and an audiobook based on the founding couturier's autobiography “Christian Dior et Moi,” read in French by Louis Garrel, who also attended the show. This was the soundtrack as guests filed into the show venue, modeled after Berlin's Gemäldegalerie museum. Other celebrities in attendance included Rihanna, A$AP Rocky, Roger Federer, Sabrina Carpenter, Daniel Craig and Drew Starkey."

VOGUE verrät, wie sie jetzt kombiniert werden. Diese 5 Schuhe aus den 80ern liegen jetzt wieder im Trend! Die Mode der 80er-Jahre ist schwer zu vergessen – die Schulterpolster zum Beispiel oder die knalligen Farben. Aber auch die ausgefallenen Schuhe aus dem vergangenen Jahrzehnt sind legendär und werden im Sommer 2025 wieder rauf und runter getragen – darunter Ballerinas, Slingbacks oder zweifarbige Pumps. VOGUE verrät, welche Modelle zurück auf dem Laufsteg – und der Straße – sind und wie sie heute kombiniert werden. 5 Modelle aus den 80ern, die im Sommer 2025 wieder angesagt sind #1 Ballerinas In den 30er-Jahren lancierten Designer:innen wie Christian Dior, Elsa Schiaparelli und Yves Saint Laurent die ersten Ballerinas, die nicht nur für ihre Eleganz, sondern auch für ihren Komfort gefeiert wurden. Später dann, in den 80er-Jahren, war auch Prinzessin Diana ein großer Fan der Silhouette; während Kate Moss und Alexa Chung in den späten 2000er- und frühen 2010er-Jahren zu den Anhängerinnen gehörten. Perry Ellis stellte 1987 ein schlichtes weißes Modell vor, das sie gepaart mit einem weißen, geradlinigen Look über den Laufsteg schickte. Nachdem die Modelle dann einige Jahre von der Bildfläche verschwunden waren, bahnten sie sich in den letzten Saisons ihren Weg zurück an die Spitze. Während in den 80er-Jahren aber vorrangig klassische Designs im Vordergrund standen, zeigen sich die Ballerinas heute verspielter – zum Beispiel aus Mesh oder PVC, mit Leoparden- oder Reptilmuster. Bei Chloé präsentierte Chemena Kamali beispielsweise eine geschnürte Boho-Version der Schuhe, die sie zu einem fließenden roséfarbenen Set kombinierte. #2 Slingbacks Apropos elegante Schuhe: Slingback-Modelle, also jene mit Riemchen um die Ferse, gehörten in den 80er-Jahren zur Arbeitsuniform der Frauen. 1987, als das sogenannte Power-Dressing in vollem Gange war, brauchte man ein Design, das bequem, aber dennoch formell war. So wählte Giorgio Armani für seine Kollektion im besagten Jahr Slingbacks, die er zu einer Bundfaltenhose, einer Bluse und einem Blazer mit breiten Schulterpolstern kombinierte. In 2025 kommen Slingbacks besonders gerne mit Kitten Heels daher – wie Marken wie Jacquemus, Contessa Mills und Tamara Ralph bestätigen. Letztere setzte auf eine schwarze Variante der Slingbacks und kombinierte sie mit einer samtigen Off-Shoulder-Bluse und einem Midirock mit Perlenverzierung. #3 T-Steg-Sandalen Sich von vergangenen Jahrzehnten inspirieren zu lassen, ist kein neues Konzept. Und während die Mode der 80er-Jahre der Welt eine Mischung aus Opulenz, Sinnlichkeit und Dramatik bescherte, brachte sie auch viele Elemente der 20er-Jahre zurück – wie lange Halsketten und T-Steg-Sandalen. Givenchy stellte in 1988 beispielsweise ein mit Polka Dots verziertes Modell vor – in Kombination mit einem trägerlosen Kleid im gleichen Muster. Es gab eine Zeit, in der Schuhe mit T-Steg als altmodisch galten. Jetzt, im Sommer 2025, finden die geschichtsträchtigen und mühelos eleganten Schuhe wieder Anklang. Christopher Esber, eine Marke mit australischen Wurzeln, verlieh ihnen mit einer Mesh-Variante und gestylt zum minimalistischen Ensemble aus einem weißen Neckholdertop und einer schwarzen Stoffhose einen modernen Dreh. #4 Oxford-Schuhe In den späten 80er-Jahren begann sich langsam der Minimalismus, der die nächsten Jahre prägen sollte, zu etablieren. Ein Stil, der sich durch androgyne Accessoires – wie zum Beispiel die Oxford-Schuhe – bemerkbar machte. Ralph Lauren hatte sie 1985 bereits mit Absatz vorgestellt; Helmut Lang und Yohji Yamamoto verwischten die Geschlechtergrenzen dann mit Versionen, die fast identisch zu den Herrenschuhen waren. Lang kombinierte sie mit einem langärmeligen Rollkragenkleid, Yamamoto mit einer weißen Oversize-Weste und einem blauen Satinrock. Oxford-Schuhe zogen sich wie ein roter Faden durch die Frühjahr/Sommer-Kollektion 2025 von Loewe. Anstatt sie wie damals zu ebenso androgynen Looks zu stylen, sorgte Jonathan Anderson für einen Stilbruch und kombinierte sie zu romantisch-verspielten Blumen- und Babydoll-Kleidern. #5 Zweifarbige Pumps Das Chanel der 80er-Jahre verkörperte einen Luxus, der sich durch Tweed-Sets, Perlenschmuck – und zweifarbige Pumps auszeichnete. Gründerin Coco Chanel trug oft selbst ein Paar mit niedrigem Absatz. 1982 (ein Jahr bevor Karl Lagerfeld zum französischen Modehaus stieß) sah man zweifarbige Pumps in Kombination mit einem weißen Kleid, einem schwarzen Blazer, Handschuhen, Gürteln und langen Perlenketten auf dem Laufsteg. Während diese klassischen schwarz-cremefarbenen Pumps weiterhin bei Chanel zu sehen sind, gibt es Häuser wie Nina Ricci oder Balmain, die die zweifarbigen Modelle ausgefallener – aber immer noch im gleichen Stil – interpretieren. Balmain setzte für den Sommer 2025 beispielsweise auf eine rot-goldene Version, gepaart mit einem Tweed-Minirock und einer passenden Jacke."

mov_71C1640AA80D318C86760DDFE00697B1,2025-07-04 09:00:00,en,WEB,"  Share this article The last of our four-part cover story series for Her World's July issue, Emerald Hill's rising stars find common ground in their personal ambitions – where self-belief, authenticity and due diligence are their secrets to success. Read more about Tasha Low, Zhang Ze Tong and the trio together. As a child, Tyler Ten could not be further in demeanour from the quiet and well-mannered man that he comes across as today. He describes himself as a rebellious youth, growing up in neighbourhood schools and mixing with a lot of “delinquent kids”. But he is grateful for that time in his life and it is “very precious” to him, as it has shaped who he is as a person. It was also in his growing up years that he picked up Muay Thai after being inspired by martial arts movie Ong-Bak, and to build confidence and protect himself. He was 12 years old at the time, and was immersed in an environment where weaker figures would get picked on. “I was tall and skinny – I was already 1.78m in Primary 6 – and I was bullied all the time. It affected my confidence,” the 1.9m actor recalls matter-of-factly. “I was growing too fast [according to the school medical check-ups], and so I needed to get checked. I had already started lifting weights at that point, in hopes of stunting my growth. Things changed though, when he entered Singapore Polytechnic to study interior design. “I started to mix with different groups of friends who are more positive,” he says. “It was there that I focused more on my studies.” Sitting across from Tyler, buff and broody as he is, it is hard to imagine him as anything less than the strongest link. The 29-year-old is introverted in a group setting, often preferring to tap out on his phone, but finds his own unique spark once someone strikes him up in conversation. His humble sincerity is something that I pick up on throughout the course of our chat. Being in front of the camera or a crowd is the same, he shrugs. “I feel that I have this special power as a celebrity. I have no idea how it works, but I switch on the extroverted me when I need to.” But once he walks through the doors of his home, it's full decompression time. “I love my bed and I love to watch shows,” he reveals.

He didn't think his personality suited the industry, and believes it all happened “by chance”. He was scouted on the streets for Star Search in 2019 while doing a part-time marketing course in university. “I was still a kid and wanted to just go into it for fun,” he claims. One thing led to another, and he eventually made it into Star Search's Top 12 finalists that year, which kick-started his career. He made his acting debut in All Around You, before landing key roles as an SCDF emergency medical technician Jayden Chee in In Safe Hands, and as army officer Chan Oon King in When Duty Calls 2. “I learnt not to chase things so blatantly. I used to think if you do a lot of videos on Tiktok, you'll go viral. But then I realised that things will come naturally to you if you have work that backs you.” - Tyler Ten What has kept Tyler going in this line of work is his family, whom he wants to give a “better life”. “I grew up in a simple and humble family. We didn't have a lot, but we had everything we needed,” he says. “They are the main motivation why I work hard in this industry.” Amassing almost 93,000 followers on Tiktok is no easy feat, but Tyler does not consider himself a Tiktok personality, explaining that he prefers to focus on live vlogs and the occasional trend-led video. “I learnt not to chase things so blatantly,” he ruminates. “I used to think if you do a lot of videos on Tiktok, you'll go viral. But then I realised that things will come naturally to you if you have work that backs you.” Tyler believes that has been the case for Emerald Hill, which he credits for propelling him to the next rung on the popularity ladder. Getting the role of Bai Ah Li was “very important” to him, and he recalls being “beyond excited” when he received the news, as a lot of effort had gone into auditioning for a character that is his polar opposite.

Според италианското издание Corriere della Sera, тоалет от впечатляващата сватбена колекция на Санчес липсва. Макар сред местните да се шушука, че роклята може да е открадната, до момента няма подаден сигнал или започнато разследване по случая. Все още не е ясно коя точно от зашеметяващите рокли на Санчес се е „изпарила“, но според Daily Mail най-ценната ѝ рокля – уникалната дантелена Dolce & Gabbana, с която тя мина под венчило, е в безопасност. Този впечатляващ модел е вдъхновен от визията на София Лорен в култовия филм ""Houseboat"" от 1958 г., където тя се омъжва за Кари Грант. Роклята на Санчес впечатли с дълги ръкави, корсетен силует, висока яка и типична „русалка“ пола. Отпред бяха зашити 180 копчета – стилно подчертаване на уникалния дизайн. As a devoted fan of both Sophia Loren and Dolce & Gabbana, I'm absolutely thrilled with this beautiful nod to la Dolce Vita It added a refined touch to the Bezos-Sanchez wedding, recalling that iconic image from the 1958 film Houseboat with Cary Grant and Sophia Loren Bravo! pic.twitter.com/53LauslVnF — Mambo Italiano (@mamboitaliano__) June 27, 2025 „Първоначално исках нещо модерно, изчистено и секси, а накрая се спрях на тоалет, който носи духа на момента и показва къде съм днес. Аз съм различна жена от тази преди пет години“, сподели новата госпожа Безос пред Vogue. „Това е голяма промяна спрямо очакванията – обикновено нося рокли с открити рамене или с дълбоки деколтета“, допълва 55-годишната бивша телевизионна водеща. Седмицата на сватбата премина с истински моден маратон: Лорън Санчес впечатли гостите на двете празнични вечери с винтидж рокля Alexander McQueen, декорирана с копчета, както и с флорална haute couture рокля на Schiaparelli. На самия сватбен ден тя се появи първо с бял костюм Dior и копринен шал Hermès, преди да облече булчинската рокля за церемонията.

Vogue разкрива, че стилният ѝ уикенд е включвал още няколко специални визии: корсетна рокля, вдъхновена от Рита Хейуърт във филма „Gilda“, коктейлна рокля на Oscar de la Renta, украсена с верижки и кристали, бардови кадифен модел на Dolce & Gabbana и пищна коприна с принт по картина на Каналето.

A proposito proprio di vestiti: la sposa non si è certo limitata. Ha anzi portato con sé ben 27 abiti, da sfoggiare nell'arco dei tre giorni di sfarzosissimi e lussuosi festeggiamenti. Si è rivolta a diverse importanti Maison e come lei anche gli invitati. Tutto questo ha creato un certo movimento nel mondo della moda. Gli abiti del matrimonio di Lauren Sanchez e Jeff Bezos La sposa nel fatidico giorno del sì ha scelto una creazione firmata Dolce&Gabbana: un abito a sirena ispirato a Sofia Loren, in omaggio proprio all'Italia, che ha ospitato le nozze (e anche la luna di miele visto che ora i neo sposi sono in Sicilia). Tra gli altri brand a cui si è affidata: Alexander McQueen (il monospalla del primo giorno), Schiaparelli (un capo d'Alta Moda da circa 100mila euro), Alaia, Dior, Versace. Non sono mancati gli imprevisti: pare infatti che un vestito sia scomparso, forse rubato. E che dire dei look degli invitati. La guest list, top secret fino all'ultimo, includeva ospiti provenienti da ogni parte del mondo. C'erano Vittoria Ceretti con Leonardo Di Caprio, la regina Rania di Giordania, Kylie e Kendall Jenner, Kim Kardashian, Sydney Sweeney. Proprio l'attrice ha riscosso particolare successo coi suoi outfit. Lauren Sànchez in Schiaparelli Haute Couture Quali brand hanno guadagnato di più dalle nozze Secondo un report di Launchmetrics riportato da WWD, il matrimonio dell'imprenditore (fondatore e proprietario di Amazon) e della giornalista avrebbe prodotto ben 222 milioni di dollari di Media Impact Value (MIV). Sul fronte moda, pare ne abbia beneficiato soprattutto Dolce&Gabbana (avendo firmato l'abito bianco): si parla di una visibilità mediatica del valore di 14,5 milioni di dollari e di un incremento del 28% in quanto a esposizione mediatica nei giorni dell'evento. Il brand, tra l'altro, non ha vestito solo la sposa ma anche alcuni invitati: Vittoria Ceretti, Kylie Jenner, Sydney Sweeney. Il look Versace di Lauren Sanchez per il party Dolce Notte Bene anche per Schiaparelli, che ha realizzato il look del party pre nozze: ha generato 4 milioni di dollari, seguito da Versace che ha pensato al look post matrimonio con 2,8 milioni. Nella classifica stilata da Launchmetrics compaiono anche Alexander McQueen, Dilara Findikoglu (che ha vestito le sorelle Kardashian), Roberto Cavalli, la designer di gioielli Lorraine Schwartz e Tom Ford. Sydney Sweeney in Galia Lahav E che dire di Galia Lahav. Il brand ha firmato il look personalizzato di Sydney Sweeney per l'evento finale del sabato sera: l'abito da 25.000 dollari realizzato in 150 ore di lavoro ha avuto un impatto molto positivo per il brand. Come riporta WWD, il marchio avrebbe registrato un aumento addirittura del 200% nelle vendite e-commerce in sole 24 ore, ricevendo più di 80 richieste specifiche per l'abito dell'attrice. Sydney Sweeney in Galia Lahav Il responsabile globale delle PR, Yael Friedman, ha dichiarato: ""L'esposizione ha generato un netto aumento di appuntamenti con le clienti e un fortissimo engagement sui social media. È stato un esempio perfetto di come un look audace e di grande visibilità possa aumentare la desiderabilità e la brand awareness, oltre a portare risultati commerciali tangibili"". 0 CONDIVISIONI"

The coat, which was part of Jonathan Anderson's debut collection as the creative director for both menswear and womenswear at Dior, featured traditional Indian Mukaish embroidery. Despite its heritage and craftsmanship, Anderson has reportedly failed to acknowledge these artisans' contributions. Craftsmanship details Coat made by 12 artisans over 34 days Fashion commentator Hanan Besnovic aka ideservecouture on Instagram highlighted why the coat was so expensive. The coat, unveiled at Paris Fashion Week on June 27, was made by 12 artisans over a period of 34 days. The embroidery technique used is called Mukaish or Badla work, which originated in the Awadh region of Lucknow. This traditional Indian embroidery involves using thin metal wires (badla) to create intricate designs on fabric without any thread or glue. Similar past incident Similar controversy involved Prada This controversy comes right after another fashion debacle involving Prada. The Italian luxury brand faced criticism for presenting sandals at Milan Fashion Week that closely resembled India's Kolhapuri chappals. Although Prada described the footwear as ""leather footwear,"" it did not acknowledge their Indian roots, leading to accusations of cultural appropriation by Indians."

Everything Poison is not supposed to be. Matronly vanilla powder-puff Avon stuff. At the same time, it was sickeningly, overwhelmingly dry. I think now it was the sandalwood in it. It had about the same affect as an Axe body spray. I've kept trying the stuff though. I bought the EDP next, which I do find to be a big improvement over the far more popular EDT. It's nice, but not something I need to smell like. Next, I got a bottle of the 1998 formula, which is supposed to be a brilliant masterpiece that changed the game of which is new version is only a shadow of. It smells exactly like my 2022 bottle, only much weaker. Then I go through the trouble of getting Dua's version. This is supposed to be an extrait version of the brilliant 1998 game-changing formula. The notes are more distinguishable in this one than in Dior's, at least. However, the sandalwood that comes in at the very end is far too dry and headache inducing. I don't hate it anymore. I became accustomed to the things that I couldn't tolerate about it at first. Its been something I felt I had to 'figure out' due to it's immense popularity, and it's overshadowing the first 'love of my life', Poison 1985."

Exploring the World Through ""The"" - Language Immersion Language immersion is a concept that intensely submerges you in a new speech. Through participatory engagement, you absorb the nuances of a new language by enveloping yourself in its environment. This can involve living in a country where the desired language is used, attending conversation schools, or even joining online communities. - Submergence provides a exceptional opportunity to master a language at a more profound level than traditional textbook settings allow. - With dialoguing with native speakers, you hone your oral skills and attain a real understanding of the culture associated with the terms. As you envelop yourself in a new language, you discover a abundance of thoughts and narratives. Unlocking the Power of ""Comme"": Everyday French Conversations Made Easy Embark on a journey into the fascinating world of everyday French conversation by mastering the versatile word ""comme""|express like.

Comme des Garçons: Deconstructing Haute Couture Comme des Garçons, established by Rei Kawakubo, stands as a paradoxical force within the realm of fashion. The label consistently challenges expected notions of beauty and design, juxtaposing elegance with experimentalism. Kawakubo's signature aesthetic often involves deconstructing iconic garments, reimagining them into fragmented and unconventional silhouettes. Her collections frequently feature a dramatic palette of black, white, and gray, punctuated by occasional bursts of vibrant shades. This deliberate use of minimalism serves to highlight the architectural more info and physical qualities of her creations. Through a series of carefully curated presentations, Kawakubo expresses complex themes that often explore identity. Her runway shows are not merely fashion displays; they are thought-provoking performances that challenge viewers to question their own perceptions of beauty, normality, and the role of fashion in society. Embracing Imperfection in Life and Design In a world that often prizes perfection, it's easy to get caught up in the pursuit of something unattainable. But what if we shifted our perspective? What if we welcomed the inherent variations that make life and design so intriguing? - Here - mindset recognizes that charm can be found in the subtle. Imagine about a hand-painted ceramic mug with a slightly wonky handle or a vintage dress with a few details. These flaws don't detract from their beauty; instead, they tell a story of time. In essence, ""comme ça"" is about celebrating the diversity of life and design. It's about recognizing grace in the ordinary. 6. The Cultural Relevance of ""Comme"" in Francophone Society Within the diverse tapestry of Francophone culture, the seemingly simple word ""comme"" assumes a surprisingly complex role. Far exceeding its literal meaning of ""like"" or ""as,"" it serves as a linguistic chameleon, effortlessly adapting to convey nuances of similarity and even shaping social interactions. From its subtle presence in casual conversations to its more pronounced impact on formal discourse, ""comme"" reveals itself as a fundamental building block of Francophone communication. Ultimately, understanding the multifaceted significance of this word unlocks a deeper appreciation for the richness and complexity of the Francophone world."

Според италианското издание ""Кориере дела Сера"", тоалет от впечатляващата сватбена колекция на Санчес липсва. Макар сред местните да се шушука, че роклята може да е открадната, до момента няма подаден сигнал или започнато разследване по случая. Все още не е ясно коя точно от зашеметяващите рокли на Санчес се е „изпарила“, но според ""Дейли Мейл"" най-ценната ѝ рокля – уникалната дантелена Dolce & Gabbana, с която тя мина под венчило, е в безопасност. Този впечатляващ модел е вдъхновен от визията на София Лорен в култовия филм ""Houseboat"" от 1958 г., където тя се омъжва за Кари Грант. Роклята на Санчес впечатли с дълги ръкави, корсетен силует, висока яка и типична „русалка“ пола. Отпред бяха зашити 180 копчета – стилно подчертаване на уникалния дизайн. ""Първоначално исках нещо модерно, изчистено и секси, а накрая се спрях на тоалет, който носи духа на момента и показва къде съм днес. Аз съм различна жена от тази преди пет години“, сподели новата госпожа Безос пред Vogue. ""Това е голяма промяна спрямо очакванията – обикновено нося рокли с открити рамене или с дълбоки деколтета“, допълва 55-годишната бивша телевизионна водеща. Седмицата на сватбата премина с истински моден маратон: Лорън Санчес впечатли гостите на двете празнични вечери с винтидж рокля Alexander McQueen, декорирана с копчета, както и с флорална haute couture рокля на Schiaparelli.  На самия сватбен ден тя се появи първо с бял костюм Dior и копринен шал Hermès, преди да облече булчинската рокля за церемонията. Пижаменото афтърпарти „Dolce Notte“, организирано след сватбата, също не мина без блясък – Санчес се появи в ефектна Atelier Versace рокля без презрамки, богато бродирана с кристали, която със сигурност надхвърля типичните стандарти за парти в пижами. Vogue разкрива, че стилният ѝ уикенд е включвал още няколко специални визии: корсетна рокля, вдъхновена от Рита Хейуърт във филма „Джилда“, коктейлна рокля на Oscar de la Renta, украсена с верижки и кристали, бардови кадифен модел на Dolce & Gabbana и пищна коприна с принт по картина на Каналето."

Alongside Naomi, Linda, Christy, and Cindy, Helena helped redefine what it meant to be a model: not just a face, but a force. She walked for Chanel, Versace, Valentino, and fronted campaigns that shaped fashion history. But beyond the glitter and glamour, Helena's journey has always been guided by intuition, instinct, and an insatiable curiosity about the world. “I didn't plan far ahead,” she tells @itsmeanitab. “I kind of just floated along, but was deeply connected to how I felt deep down in my stomach.” Now, decades into an inimitable career, she opens up about quiet reinvention, the grace and freedom of mid-life, and why this era might just be her most meaningful yet.

Also, I don't think the whole collection was super commercial, but I did notice it had more logos than his other work. I also don't think it was a bad collection, some of the clothes and styling are beautiful, but it did leave me wanting more… especially since it's jonathan.anderson that we are talking about. There are also many other references besides Warhol, of course, but his polaroid of Basquiat was one of the main ones. I also feel that the average Dior customer might not catch the deeper references. I also enjoyed the analysis of the collection from thatadult on YouTube, so go check that out.

Making each class very diverse, I've never had a particular problem until now. I have a classmate who, for the sake of this story, is on the lesser side. While the rest of my class -- Including me are on the higher up side, Making the difference in small things such as bags, accessories, gadgets, and even skin products quite obvious. None of us weren't exactly the type to be greedy, We'd even share if he asked us. It all started when one of my friends, M, in that same class, lost all the cash in her wallet consisting of 8k, Which she brought to pay for a portion of her tuition fee. The entire classroom was turned upside down but we still had no luck finding it, resulting in her having to save up her pocket money which was 1k, Everyday to save up and pay for her tuition fee. The next Monday after my friend's tuition fee money was stolen, One of our classmates, P, had a new camera which coincidentally cost the same amount that had went missing. But brushed it off and thought it was a coincidence. Soon, A patter emerged, Items like camera's and designer makeup which was mostly Dior and Guerlain went missing and he always coincidentally had the same exact product the next day. After gathering witnesses who have seen him pacing around where we keep our bags, our class submitted a formal report which was quickly denied by our school, saying we needed video proof of him stealing in our classroom without any cameras. Moving up eventually came and he announced that he'd be going to a new school, A majority of my classmates and friends breathed out a sigh of relief behind his back. When I found out he was going to a school where I had connections to the student body, I couldn't help myself and texted him. Telling him about how P stole from everyone, and to warn other students. This eventually came out without my name being dragged into it. It's now been a month since that happened, I heard he's still unsuccessful in making friends. I feel guilty, but at the same time I don't."

Cultural appropriation is an incendiary topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow, or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets it as a gown, be happy. One would be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires, but it has only two global consumer brands. Having a large home market - by volume, not value - our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts - a net $90 bn deficit. It doesn't help that India's GI regulation is the weakest form of 'sui-generis protection mechanism', as Akriti and Pinaki Ghosh wrote in 2024 in 'Challenges in the Utilization of GI Registration for Capitalizing GI Products', in Journal of Intellectual Property Rights. Lack of enforceability dilutes 'transparency, fairness, effectiveness, and accountability - pillars of good governance', they argue. Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous statutory drafting, sloppy marketing and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations to spur the ages- old artisanship and economically uplift kolhapuri makers. None of the large Indian business groups - those even in fashion or retail - have come forward yet to safeguard their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled sarees as part of a sustainability project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration of iconic monuments and archaeological sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship. From sarees to shoes, music to movies, we hardly prize our handlooms or history, artisans or antiquities. We do not appreciate our own, till the world appreciates it. Oddly enough, while we seek outside validation, we also get easily enraged. Satyajit Ray was 'extremely discouraged' by the initial reception of Pather Panchali in India, Kolkata included. International acclaim, starting with Best Human Document Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, turned the tide. It took America-born Sally Holkar to revive Maheshwari weaves, or John Bissell to create a brand for our fabrics in Fabindia. Delhi-based Scot William Dalrymple has taken India's primordial gift for myth and narrative to make scholarship in history accessible. While the renaissance of modern Indian art owes much to Japanese businessman Masanori Fukuoka. Unless we own, defend and develop our own value chains, we shall continue to let our misplaced chauvinism get the better of us. The devil doesn't just wear Prada."

The late Carolyn Bessette is surging to the top of the pop culture zeitgeist again and her classic style is a part of the conversation. Ryan Murphy's upcoming series, American Love Story, featuring her love story with John F. Kennedy Jr., might have been the catalyst for the resurgence. Still, it's Bessette's fashion icon status that is making everyone take a deeper dive into her life again. TikTok is pushing the Bessette style narrative again as beauty and style mavens flock to the West Village in Manhattan to scoop up Charles J. Wahba tortoise-shell headbands sold at C.O. Bigelow pharmacy. It may seem like a simple accessory to some, but it's Bessette's relatable style that makes sense in a very expensive 2025 world. ""Carolyn represents this chic, quiet luxury style, I think many women want to emulate but feel they can't afford. So, the headbands provide an affordable and accessible way to participate, "" influencer Beverly Hart explained to The New York Post. Still, Bessette's fashion voice developed as a reaction to life in the public eye instead of a carefully curated image in the press. The 2024 biography, Once Upon a Time: The Captivating Life of Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy by Elizabeth Beller, spoke to friends who dismissed the idea that Bessette was obsessed with her wardrobe. Pal Michelle Kessler thought Bessette would laugh at her ""fashion icon "" description. ""She was trying to be nothing of the sort. Carolyn was trying to have an interesting life and go about her day without interruption, "" Kessler said. The 2023 book, CBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: A Life in Fashion by Sunita Kumar Nair, shared a similar philosophy about JFK Jr.'s wife. ""She didn't seek fame but was carved in a certain light, a light she sometimes enjoyed but mostly eschewed, rarely speaking to the press. Instead, she used fashion as a vehicle for communication - at times to thwart the insatiable camera lens but mostly thriving in her chosen ensemble, "" Nair wrote in the book. Instead of Chanel and Christian Dior, Bessette chose ""the understated, tailored, and soft-yet-structured Calvin Klein, Prada, and Yohji Yamamoto garments, "" as noted by The Cut ""I think if she was alive today, she would still want to be a mystery, but fashion is where she showed herself, "" Bessette's former Calvin Klein coworker Stormy Stokes said in Nair's book. ""It was the part she was happy to display."" Before you go, click here to see all the best pictures of JFK Jr. and Carolyn Bessette.

Louis Vuitton Korea, the South Korean unit of the global luxury brand, has been hit by a cyberattack. The company confirmed that a systems hacking in June led to the exposure of some customer contact information. The company assured customers that no financial data was compromised in the incident. “We regret to inform that an unauthorized third party temporarily accessed our system resulting in the leak of some customer information,” the unit stated in a press release.The luxury brand became aware of the breach on Wednesday (July 2) and promptly notified government authorities. Louis Vuitton Korea stated it has already implemented measures to contain the breach and significantly enhance its system security protocols.This incident marks the latest in a series of high-profile data leaks affecting the luxury sector in South Korea this year. The country's Personal Information Protection Commission (PIPC) has been investigating the South Korean units of two other labels under the world's largest luxury group, Christian Dior Couture and Tiffany, since May, following data leaks they reported earlier in the year.In May, Dior issued an apology after discovering a data breach that occurred in January. Tiffany also disclosed in May that it had experienced a breach in April. Separately, Cartier notified its customers last month about a distinct incident involving leaked personal information.Beyond major luxury brands, ""Must It,"" a popular luxury goods e-commerce platform in South Korea, also reported two hacking attempts in May and June. The platform warned users that personal data, including names, gender, and dates of birth, may have been stolen in those attempts."

As stated by davidsinclairphd - Scientist/Geneticist/Professor at Harvard University… “Your clock is ticking faster by always being fed.” I've been getting a lot of questions about what my secret is to maintaining youth/fitness, and I'd love to share some info and hope it inspires you. I've been fasting with a time restricted window of eating for many years, long before it was popular. Initially, it started by intuition/ listening to my body. Today, I can humbly say that people tend to presume I'm in my 30's. The reason why this is interesting is because, I'm 52. All I can say is, there is definitely something to this. My lifestyle includes: Never thinking about/using words like “age/old”; I eat 1 meal a day, every 24 hours around 6:30pm and have fruits/veggies/salads/fish/chicken; no carbs-occasionally popcorn; do not eat/drink anything with sugar, gmo's, etc.; no alcohol; never use drugs/no smoking; get 7-8 hours of sleep a night; start the day with water, coffee, stretching/cardio work out/light weights; take vitamins/supplements; This is a commitment. It takes consistency, discipline, self control/holding yourself accountable. If you're starting on this journey, please know it should be gradual and not something to jump into overnight. It has been proven by scientific studies and research to have many health benefits in reprogramming genes/DNA, age reversal, preventing diseases and ultimate fitness. It has worked for me and has been the key in helping maintain health/wellness, youth and fitness! ❤️tamara.gee.music #fasting #health #fitlife #fit #youth #wellness #healthyliving #discipline  BEAUTY LOOK: White luminous Highlighter: diorbeauty in Opal Sequin sephora White eyeshadow: Let it snow sephora Bronzer: diorbeauty Tan #5 Lipstick: Rouge Dior diorbeauty nude 300 Lashes: Bombshell amazon Mascara: Black SizeUp sephora Lip plumper: Outrageous plump intense sephora"

In the case of the famous, there's an existential dry run with bio﻿pics﻿ – though they m﻿ay not always look like your life. Ringo Starr says he asked for script changes for the Sam Mendes film project. Four films are planned – one for each Beatle – with Starr played by Barry Keoghan. While pleased now, Starr felt the initial script didn't reflect him or Maureen (his first wife, who died of leukaemia in 1994): “'That's not how we were,' I'd say. ' We would never do that.'” This reminds me of a niggle watching Peter Jackson's Get Back, the 2021 restoration of Michael Lindsay-Hogg's 1970 ﻿documentary, Let It Be. It only clicked on the second viewing: the Beatles' wives have undergone a modicum of deep﻿fakery/airbrushing. The men have, too: in some scenes﻿ Paul McCartney has the shine of a freshly glazed doughnut. But ﻿Linda McCartney and Maureen especially are blandly smoothed﻿ – unnecessarily prettified﻿, veritable Chat GPT versions of themselves. It's perhaps a side-effect of the restoration techniques﻿ but it's still an outrageous liberty, especially when considering the superior reality of Maureen's working-class fizz, and Linda's proto-vintage individualism. It's so nice to learn that Starr wants to see his real﻿ Maureen. We all do. From the band that gave us Paperback Writer to the news that literature is the new arm candy. Dior's incoming creative director, Jonathan Anderson, has launched a series of litera﻿ture-themed tote bags, including: Charles Baudelaire's Les Fleurs de Mal; Pierre Choderlos de Laclos's Les Liaisons Dangereuses; and Bram Stoker's Dracula, for those with an inner goth. Rihanna has been spotted ﻿with the Dracula: a triumph of, erm, structured cotton, and﻿ (double﻿ erm)﻿ a steal at £2,500. The literary bag has been done before – from 1984 cross-body clutches to Wuthering Heights satchels – but this is next level. Though﻿ if the humble bookworm just got a glow up, it may provoke one of those ﻿waves of moral panic ﻿like those when people are shown to prefer film and television adaptations to original works. Now you don't even have to turn on a screen for your literature﻿ fix, just sling on the designer bag. Speaking of the moral vapours, everyone to their stations; it upsets Kirstie Allsopp when she can't see us working. On Tuesday morning, the TV property doyenne posted a photo of an empty ﻿tube carriage ﻿with the words: “Don't know quite what it says but it can't be a good thing.” I can't be the only one who hears the Location, Location, Location theme tune and feels an urge to drop into a curtsey Some on social media suggested that Allsopp m﻿ay be out of touch: at 9.20am, many would already be at work. It was also the hottest day of the year – a vaporising 33 degrees in some parts of London – people may have opted to work from home. Obviously﻿ Allsopp, the daughter of a baron, is extremely posh: I can't be the only one who hears the Location, Location, Location theme tune and feels an urge to drop into a curtsey. Allsopp also has form for criticising ﻿working from home﻿, in 2020﻿ tweeting that, post-lockdown, people should return to offices to “prove their worth” to employers. Concern over WFH is reasonable – from the socioeconomic impact to the effect on the national psyche – but you do wonder if it goes deeper with Kirstie. If lodged somewhere in the ancestral hippocampus, there's a psychological need to see the peasants ba﻿ling hay, scrubbing hearths, succumbing to smallpox﻿ and the like. Or, these days, obediently steaming like human bao buns on public transport﻿. People like Allsopp may just be wired to expect the rest of us to be conspicuously toiling. Is it really too much to ask?

FA0724F511A32E4DC29B070B1282CCB9,2025-07-05 05:02:17,en,PRINT,"  Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride. While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb — without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries,   working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch   and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand — one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary   topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western   couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow,   or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri   has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets   it as a gown, be happy. One would   be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires,   but it has only two global consumer   brands. Having a large home market — by volume, not value — our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts   — a net $90 bn deficit. It doesn't help that India's GI regulation   is the weakest form of 'sui-generis   protection mechanism', as Akriti and Pinaki Ghosh wrote in 2024 in 'Challenges in the Utilization of GI Registration for Capitalizing GI Products',   in Journal of Intellectual Property   Rights. Lack of enforceability dilutes 'transparency, fairness, effectiveness,   and accountability — pillars of good governance', they argue. Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single   malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous   statutory drafting, sloppy marketing   and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative   zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism   of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace   and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations   to spur the ages old   artisanship and economically   uplift kolhapuri   makers. None of the large Indian business groups — those even in fashion or retail — have come forward yet to safeguard   their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative   process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled   sarees as part of a sustainability   project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration   of iconic monuments and archaeological   sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve   or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship. From sarees to shoes, music to movies, we hardly prize our handlooms or history, artisans or antiquities. We do not appreciate our own, till the world appreciates it. Oddly enough, while we seek outside validation, we also get easily enraged. Satyajit Ray was 'extremely discouraged'   by the initial reception of Pather Panchali in India, Kolkata included. International acclaim, starting with Best Human Document Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, turned the tide. It took America-born Sally Holkar   to revive Maheshwari weaves, or John Bissell to create a brand for our fabrics in Fabindia. Delhi-based Scot William Dalrymple has taken India's primordial gift for myth and narrative to make scholarship   in history accessible. While the renaissance of modern Indian art owes much to Japanese businessman Masanori Fukuoka. Unless we own, defend and develop our own value chains, we shall continue   to let our misplaced chauvinism get the better of us. The devil doesn't just wear Prada. arijit.barman@timesofindia.com"

بین‌المللی، دارای ظرفیت‌های فراوان و مزیت‌های نسبی منحصر به فردی است که کمتر به آن توجه شده است. این ظرفیت‌ها که از منابع طبیعی، نیروی انسانی خلاق و بازار مصرف داخلی نشأت می‌گیرد، همراه با توانمندی‌های فناورانه و ابتکارات نوآورانه، زمینه‌ساز رشد و توسعه پایدار در این صنعت می‌باشد. نگاه به بیرون و انتظار رفع تحریم‌ها یا مذاکرات بین‌المللی هرگز نباید نقطه اتکا و راه‌حل اصلی توسعه صنعت نساجی ایران باشد. بلکه باید با اتکا به دارایی‌های خود و استفاده هوشمندانه از فرصت‌های بومی و جهانی، مسیری مستقل و مقتدرانه برای پیشرفت این صنعت طراحی کنیم.  در این مقاله با مرور 40 ظرفیت کلیدی ایران و 27 ابتکار عمل در صنعت نساجی در سطح جهانی، چارچوبی عملیاتی و مبتنی بر واقعیت‌های کشور ارائه شده که می‌تواند ایران را از بند محدودیت‌ها رها ساخته و به جایگاه واقعی خود در بازارهای جهانی برساند. در همین زمینه بیشتر بخوانید الف) 28 تجربه جهانی در صنعت پوشاک و نساجی 1. انگلستان – آغاز صنعتی‌سازی با صنعت نساجی در انقلاب صنعتی قرن 18 انگلستان نخستین کشوری بود که در اواخر قرن 18 با بهره‌گیری از ماشین بخار و سازماندهی کارخانه‌ای، صنعت نساجی را به نقطه آغاز انقلاب صنعتی تبدیل کرد. توسعه ماشین‌های بافندگی، پیدایش کارخانه‌های متمرکز در منچستر و لیدز، و بهره‌برداری از استعمار هند به‌عنوان منبع پنبه خام، این کشور را در قرن 19 به قطب بی‌بدیل تولید پارچه بدل کرد. دولت بریتانیا با حفاظت از نوآوری‌های تکنولوژیک (مانند ماشین اسپینینگ جنی) و ممنوعیت صادرات ابزار تولید تا مدت‌ها از سلطه خود دفاع کرد. تجربه بریتانیا نشان می‌دهد که نساجی می‌تواند پیشران توسعه صنعتی و آغازگر زنجیره‌های بزرگ اشتغال باشد. 2. هند – احیای صنعت نساجی در قرن بیست و یکم با تمرکز بر پنبه و صادرات هند در سال‌های اخیر با صادرات بیش از 40 میلیارد دلار پوشاک و پارچه، به یکی از غول‌های جهانی در صنعت نساجی تبدیل شده است. این کشور با بهره‌گیری از پنبه داخلی، نیروی کار ارزان، و سیاست‌های حمایتی از زنجیره تولید، به‌ویژه در ایالت‌هایی مانند تامیل‌نادو، گجرات و ماهاراشترا، توانسته است مزیت مقیاس را تثبیت کند. نهادهایی مانند وزارت نساجی هند با ارائه یارانه صادرات، تسهیل‌گری در تأسیس پارک‌های صنعتی و ایجاد زنجیره‌های خوشه‌ای، این صنعت را به یکی از پایه‌های توسعه منطقه‌ای تبدیل کرده‌اند. هند همچنین با توسعه برندهای داخلی مانند FabIndia، در پی ارتقاء ارزش افزوده و طراحی بومی است. 3. ترکیه – توسعه صنعت پوشاک با تمرکز بر صادرات و برندهای بومی ترکیه در دو دهه گذشته با تمرکز بر صادرات به اروپا، برندهای موفقی مانند LC Waikiki، Koton و Mavi را در بازارهای بین‌المللی تثبیت کرده است. سیاست‌های ترکیه در دهه 1990 شامل آزادسازی کنترل دولتی، خصوصی‌سازی صنایع نساجی و تأسیس مناطق آزاد بود. استان‌هایی مانند دنیزلی، بورسا، و قاضی‌انتپ به مراکز تخصصی تولید پارچه و پوشاک بدل شدند. ترکیه همچنین زنجیره کامل از نخ‌ریسی تا طراحی مد و بازاریابی بین‌المللی را توسعه داد. تجربیات این کشور نشان می‌دهد که پیوند میان صنعت، صادرات، طراحی و برندینگ می‌تواند صنعت پوشاک را از خام‌فروشی به قدرت‌آفرینی اقتصادی برساند. 4. بنگلادش – ظهور به‌عنوان دومین صادرکننده پوشاک جهان با نیروی کار ارزان و سیاست تشویقی بنگلادش با صادرات بیش از 38 میلیارد دلار پوشاک در سال 2022، پس از چین دومین صادرکننده پوشاک دنیاست. نقطه قوت این کشور، نیروی کار بسیار ارزان و نظام مالیاتی و تجاری خاص مناطق ویژه صادراتی است. سیاست‌هایی چون معافیت مالیاتی، عدم وجود تعرفه بر واردات مواد اولیه، و حمایت از تأسیس کارخانه‌های کوچک و متوسط، باعث شده بیش از 4000 کارخانه پوشاک در بنگلادش فعال باشند. دولت بنگلادش با حمایت از آموزش زنان در مناطق روستایی و ایجاد زنجیره‌های خانوادگی تولید، از صنعت پوشاک به‌عنوان اهرمی برای توسعه فراگیر استفاده کرده است. 5. چین – ساخت زنجیره‌ کامل نساجی از پنبه‌کاری تا برندینگ جهانی چین از دهه 1980 با سیاست درهای باز، صنعت نساجی را به یکی از پیشران‌های صنعتی خود بدل ساخت. زنجیره تولید در چین، از کشت پنبه در ایالت‌های غربی، تا تولید ماشین‌آلات نساجی، دوخت، طراحی و فروش بین‌المللی گسترده است. مناطق ویژه اقتصادی مانند شنژن و شانگهای میزبان برندهای جهانی و کارخانه‌های بزرگ پوشاک شدند. علاوه بر تولید انبوه، چین با شرکت‌هایی مانند Bosideng یا Peacebird وارد حوزه طراحی و برندینگ جهانی نیز شد. دولت چین همچنین با انعقاد توافق‌های تجارت آزاد در جنوب شرق آسیا، صادرات نساجی را تسهیل کرده است. 6. ایتالیا – تقویت برندهای لوکس با تمرکز بر طراحی، کیفیت و مد پایدار ایتالیا به‌واسطه برندهایی چون Gucci، Prada، Armani و Dolce & Gabbana نماد طراحی فاخر در صنعت پوشاک است. این کشور زنجیره‌ای از کارگاه‌های خانوادگی، طراحان مستقل، دانشگاه‌های مد، و شرکت‌های بافندگی باکیفیت را در شمال ایتالیا – به‌ویژه در منطقه لمباردی – توسعه داده است. دولت با حمایت از صادرات برندهای لوکس، شرکت در نمایشگاه‌های جهانی، و استفاده از ابزار دیپلماسی فرهنگی، صنعت مد را به یک قدرت نرم بدل کرده است. تجربه ایتالیا نشان می‌دهد که تمرکز بر ارزش افزوده، طراحی و تولید محدود، برخلاف تولید انبوه، می‌تواند منجر به موقعیت ممتاز در بازار جهانی شود. 7. ویتنام – استفاده از توافقات تجارت آزاد برای توسعه صنعت پوشاک صادراتی ویتنام با بهره‌گیری از توافقنامه‌های تجارت آزاد با اتحادیه اروپا (EVFTA)، کره‌جنوبی، ژاپن و کشورهای ASEAN، تعرفه‌های صادراتی را کاهش داده و سرمایه‌گذاران خارجی را جذب کرده است. شهرهایی مانند هوشی‌مین و هانوی به مراکز تولید پوشاک برای برندهای بین‌المللی مانند H&M و Zara تبدیل شده‌اند. دولت با تأسیس پارک‌های صنعتی، حمایت از آموزش فنی در مدارس و معافیت مالیاتی برای سرمایه‌گذاری خارجی، رشد سریعی را در صنعت پوشاک رقم زده است....

The article wasn't about the event it was how rude Meghan was having her legs crossed even though they were still on the traditional slant. There are plenty of photos of the Royals crossing their legs including the late Queen. The photo of Meghan pregnant wearing nail polish at a formal event. It was portraited as another breach of protocol by the paparazzi sites even though there are pictures of Diana and Sophie with coloured nails. It isn't a Royal rule just something the late Queen didn't wear herself. Another big story was the fact that Meghan closed her own car door. Shock horror. The big scandal on the tabloids as Meghan didn't wear stockings after the Royal engagement was announced. The same big stink still going on as the flower girls didn't wear tights at their wedding. The massive scandal because Meghan wore Dior at Archie's christening. They also didn't open the christening to the media and kept it on the low. They released some official photos after the event. Each one of these stories contained photos so pap shots and pap stories.

Louis Vuitton、Chanel、Dior、Cartier、Hermès、YSL、Givenchy……
有没有发现，它们几乎都来自——法国‼️
这些品牌，构成了魅力法兰西🇫🇷的标志。 👑 一切从“太阳王”路易十四开始…
法国的奢侈品文化并非偶然，而是从王权时代就被“刻进DNA”。 17世纪，路易十四一边打造凡尔赛宫🌟，一边成立了皇家制造厂，让镜子这种奢侈品开始国产化。 奢侈品从王公贵族的宫廷生活延伸至工艺品、香水、家具🪑与时装👗，奠定了法国“时尚与奢华”的国家品牌。 为什么法国能称霸奢侈品界？ 🧐
这不是偶然，是一场“国家级的精心策划”：
1⃣ 历史文化传承：早在路易十四时代，奢华就已渗透进法国文化
2⃣ 政府全力扶持：法国政府长期为奢侈时尚行业提供资金、打击假货、保护品牌
3⃣ 手工艺精神：传承工坊文化，注重细节与品质
4⃣本地化营销：如在中国市场，会推出中式节日限定款
5⃣ 营造稀缺性：通过限量发售、候补名单营造“买不到”的高端感
6⃣银幕上的加持与文化影响：从赫本到梦露，明星效应强化法国品牌影响力✨
7⃣高端生活方式打造：不只是衣服包包，更是一种“精致的生活方式”
🫅强大的奢侈品集团
就像美国有科技四巨头 GAFA（Google、Amazon、Facebook、Apple）
法国也有自己的奢侈品四巨头——KHOL：
▪️Kering开云集团：旗下有Gucci、YSL、Balenciaga、BV等。 ▪️Hermès爱马仕：独立但实力强劲，球最难买的品牌之一，以手工工艺闻名。 ▪️L'Oréal欧莱雅：美妆界的王者，旗下包含Lancôme、YSL Beauty、Kiehl's等
▪️LVMH路威酩轩：涵盖Louis Vuitton、Dior、Celine、Fendi等80+品品牌。 这些集团凭借并购➕品牌矩阵➕高端战略，牢牢掌控全球市场话语权。 法国奢侈品，是艺术、工艺、身份与文化的集合。 不是一只包，而是一个故事📖
不是一瓶香水，而是一段传承💫
所以当你买下那件“Made in France”的奢侈品时，
其实你也成了这段浪漫历史的见证者之一。 💬 你最爱的法国🇫🇷奢侈品牌是哪个？ 怎么看待法国在奢侈品界的地位？ 欢迎留言聊聊💬#法国留学diy #法国 #法国留学申请"

Louis Vuitton emerged as the latest victim after unauthorized third-party infiltrators temporarily penetrated its systems on June 8, exposing sensitive customer information in yet another luxury brand attack. The fashion house acknowledged the digital intrusion Wednesday, confirming the cybersecurity breach had compromised customer data including names, contact details, and additional personal information provided by clients. The company stressed that critical financial data such as passwords and credit card numbers remained secure. This incident continues a devastating pattern targeting premium brands. Dior issued public apologies in May after discovering a breach dating back to January, while Tiffany & Co. reported its own data leak in April. The luxury sector attacks follow South Korea's most catastrophic cyber incident in April, when SK Telecom—the nation's dominant telecommunications provider—disclosed the breach of personal data belonging to over 20 million users, marking one of the country's largest cyberattacks in history. Friday brought additional consequences for the telecom giant as the South Korean government announced punitive measures against SK Telecom for failing to adequately protect user data and neglecting to report malware infections to relevant authorities within required timeframes. The Ministry of Science and ICT confirmed plans to impose fines reaching 30 million won (US$21,600) while referring the company for expanded investigation over alleged violations of data preservation orders, according to media. The escalating cyber crisis exposes critical vulnerabilities across South Korea's digital infrastructure, spanning luxury retail and essential telecommunications services.

I needed to exfoliate, hydrate, etc. That helped tremendously with my makeup routine- especially caking. I don't like a very heavy look, so I use Dior concealer on areas where I need it and blend it out well with a few dabs to keep things even. I do some brows to frame and mascara to open up my eyes. I finish with a quick neutral lip to wrap things up. Skincare was the real game changer. I went to a few stores, but what helped the most was telling Chat GPT my skin concerns. Then I used the suggested regimen and voila! Things are much better."

1b20339c8acf4fd886f9ce999a473e1b,2025-07-05 13:06:00,en,WEB,"  Bonjour! Stepping into the realm of Parisian chic is a journey. French fashion, known for its sophisticated simplicity, enchants the world with its versatility. From the iconic trench coat to check here the flamboyant handbag, French style celebrates a certain je ne sais quoi that is both sophisticated and casual. - To appreciate French fashion, one must consider its history. - The fashion capital serves as the playground for this cultural phenomenon. - Iconic brands like Chanel, Dior, and Yves Saint Laurent have defined the global landscape of fashion. Should you desire to emulate this celebrated aesthetic, this journey will unveil the secrets behind French style. Exploring the World Through ""This"" - Language Immersion Language immersion is a experience that intensely submerges you in a new language. Through active engagement, you learn the nuances of a foreign language by enveloping yourself in its society. This can include living in a country where the desired language is used, attending immersion schools, or even engaging in online communities. - Entrapment gifts a exceptional opportunity to acquire a language at a more profound level than traditional academic settings allow. - With communicating with native speakers, you develop your speaking skills and attain a genuine understanding of the traditions associated with the vocabulary. As you envelop yourself in a new dialect, you discover a wealth of thoughts and narratives. The Art of Conversation: Mastering ""Comme"" in Everyday French Embark on a journey through the fascinating world of everyday French conversation by mastering the versatile word ""comme""|as. This seemingly simple preposition holds powerful potential, allowing you to express comparisons, similarities, and even fine points with ease. From painting a picture of your favorite meal to conveying your feelings about the weather, ""comme""|such as becomes an essential tool in your conversational repertoire. - Alright then explore a few useful ways to incorporate ""comme""|as into your daily French interactions. 4. Comme des Garçons: Deconstructing Haute Couture Comme des Garçons, established by Rei Kawakubo, stands as a paradoxical force within the realm of fashion. The label consistently challenges traditional notions of beauty and design, juxtaposing elegance with unpredictability. Kawakubo's distinctive aesthetic often involves deconstructing iconic garments, reimagining them into fragmented and unconventional silhouettes. Her collections frequently feature a bold palette of black, white, and gray, punctuated by occasional bursts of vibrant hues. This deliberate use of minimalism serves to emphasize the architectural and tactile qualities of her creations. Through a series of carefully curated presentations, Kawakubo communicates complex themes that often explore humanity. Her runway shows are not merely fashion displays; they are stirring performances that challenge viewers to question their own perceptions of beauty, normality, and the role of fashion in society. Celebrating Imperfection in Life and Design In a world that often prizes flawlessness, it's easy to get caught up in the pursuit of something unattainable. But what if we shifted our perspective? What if we embraced the inherent variations that make life and design so unique? - That - mindset recognizes that beauty can be found in the unconventional. Think about a hand-painted ceramic mug with a slightly wonky handle or a vintage dress with a few patches. These characteristics don't detract from their beauty; instead, they whisper a story of time. At its core, ""comme ça"" is about celebrating the messiness of life and design. It's about finding joy in the ordinary. 6. The Cultural Significance of ""Comme"" in Francophone Society Within the diverse tapestry of Francophone culture, the seemingly simple word ""comme"" assumes a surprisingly complex role. Far exceeding its literal meaning of ""like"" or ""as,"" it serves as a linguistic chameleon, effortlessly adapting to convey nuances of comparison and even shaping social interactions. From its subtle presence in casual conversations to its more pronounced impact on formal discourse, ""comme"" reveals itself as a fundamental building block of Francophone communication. Consequently, understanding the multifaceted significance of this word unlocks a deeper appreciation for the richness and complexity of the Francophone world."

From stores F1 themed who were highly focused on racing and identifying themselves as a racing team, they became merely a fashion luxury brand to make you feel important."

Una noche en las fronteras del verano, el palazzo Labia lo habitaron pelucas rizadas, gargantillas de zafiros, chifones bordados, crinolinas bamboleantes y máscaras de seda. En 1951, Carlos de Beistegui, millonario francés de origen hispanomexicano, cuajó el centro de Venecia de artistas dispuestos a homenajear al Rey Sol con sus atuendos. Cardin, Dior y Dalí vistieron a los invitados, entre los que también se encontraban el diseñador Jacques Fath o la editora Daisy Fellowes, heredera de la fábrica de máquinas de coser Singer. A 32 minutos en barca, la islita de San Giorgio Maggiore ha repetido el desfile carnavalesco. Pedro Mansilla, autor de Sociologías de la moda, fantasea con que alguna voz cercana a Jeff Bezos y Lauren Sánchez sugiriera la posibilidad de emular la fiesta que celebró el aristócrata en Venecia hace ya casi 74 años. ""Es curioso que hayan organizado su boda allí porque aquello es un coto cerrado. Una celebración en Nueva York o en París se disuelve en la inmensidad de la ciudad. Venecia permite una fiesta en un espacio sitiado por su morfología particular. Se transforma en un club. Limita la ostentación al marco de la ciudad y obliga a observar a los invitados y a ser partícipe del acontecimiento: combina lo impagable de apropiarse de una ciudad que cuenta con la iglesia y la plaza perfectas con el hecho de que, por su presencia, todo subirá de precio. Todo será una fiesta. La diferencia con Le bal Oriental es internet: los 15 minutos de fama de los que hablaba Warhol ahora son 60. Es una cuestión de captar la atención, o sea, de poder"". Temor a la guillotina Si hay ojos que miran, hay un dedo que señala. Esa, señala Marc Giró, autor de Pijos, guía práctica: qué son, qué hacen y dónde encontrarlos, es la condición para la existencia del hortera. Para que surja, se requiere del otro. ""El privilegiado es quien define qué es el mal gusto. El hortera es una buena noticia para el pijo, el dandy, la editora de moda o quienquiera que regule la elegancia: lo afianza en su convicción de que va por el buen camino"". Para Jennifer Smith Maguire, profesora de estudios socioculturales del consumo en la Universidad de Sheffield Hallam, posicionan a la clase media como reguladores de lo que se estima civilizado. A quienes se desmarcan del gusto generalizado y despuntan como horteras, razona Mansilla, el espejo no les activa una alarma antes de salir de casa. No son conscientes de que su aspecto recolecta miradas y cuchicheos entre quienes, a través del dispendio, aspiran a que se delimiten como inferiores o, por el contrario, los asuman como pares. Si la búsqueda estética de la desmesura fuera consciente, apunta Raquel Peláez, autora de Quiero y no puedo: una historia de los pijos de España, ""nos encontraríamos ante un ejercicio kitsch o camp"". ""Desde la crisis de los años 30, en el público ha quedado la sensación de que el hortera moderno había perdido el temor de Dios y a las consecuencias de la Revolución Francesa. Al contrario de lo que exigen las reglas del dinero heredado, no disfrutan de él de manera discreta. En el nuevo rico aparece un instinto de supervivencia que invita a gastar. El ascenso social implicaba antes un derroche tan insultante que los asesores podían frenarlos, les recomendaba discreción, pero ahora, como ocurría en El gran Gatsby, se jactan de hacerlo"". En Granujas de medio pelo, de Woody Allen, unos ladronzuelos adquieren un pequeño local contiguo a un banco con el objetivo de hacer un butrón y vaciar las cajas fuertes. Como tapadera mientras estudian los planos y horarios de los empleados, abren una tienda de galletas que acaba teniendo tanto éxito que se hacen millonarios. La casa de los protagonistas se cuaja de esculturas de animales metalizados y columnas estriadas. Tracey Ullman, envuelta en gasas y enfundada en vestidos de lentejuelas, carda su melena en moños en los que podría anidar una cigüeña despistada. El mal gusto, advierte Marta D. Riezu, autora de Agua y jabón, es ""mucho más divertido, libre y lúcido a veces. No hay que aspirar en absoluto al bueno"". Giró, no obstante, detecta en la hiperfeminización de las invitadas al enlace matrimonial del fundador de Amazon un cambio de significados. ""En las fotos hemos visto a mujeres de melena larga y tacón alto, con mucho labio, recauchutadas, muy travestis, muy bronceadas, muy apretadas, que no pueden respirar. En resumen, hemos visto, y aquí viene la palabrita, mujeres ""empoderadas"" que toman el patrimonio de Mary Quant y lo rehacen, pero todas asistidas por mozos que las ayudan a montarse en la barca porque ellas solas no pueden. A un muelle hay que ir práctica, con alpargatas, como sabía Peggy Guggenheim. Lo hortera aparece cuando se desconecta lo que vistes con lo que haces"". Inmaculada de la Puente-Herrera, doctora en Filosofía y autora de El imperio de la moda, encuentra la disonancia en el escote. ""En las pasarelas de alta costura se exhibe el cuerpo, pero es una desnudez que tiene como base la armonía. Recuerdo el escote de la cantante Sabrina. La elegancia no tiene nada que ver con lucir uno de vértigo. No se trata de la dimensión de la apertura, sino del juego de pensamiento: ¿se le saldrá un pecho o no? Es la esfera lúdica del vestido para llamar la atención de manera constante, no solo cuando lo ves. Esta ostentación es una forma de mostrar poder y diferenciarse del resto sin pretender la aprobación o integración. Lo que manifiestan es que el dinero lo puede todo""...."

n1k5oym,2025-07-06 00:42:40,en,REDDIT,"  Emmy is on my permanent shit list because of this incident. Sorry if it's a bit long… Back in 2010/2011 I was still in college and interning part time at a fashion PR agency. Basically in our office we also had a showroom with designer gowns, shoes, jewelry, etc of all the fashion brands that we represented. We represented anything from high end brands like Alexander McQueen, Balenciaga, and Jimmy Choo, all the way down to smaller brands like Nicole Miller. The way it worked is that these gowns, etc would be rented out to celebrities to wear at red carpet events (or any big event where they'd be photographed). 90% of the time the stylists of these people would come in on their own, grab a bunch of items, and then return them after the event was done. However, every so often a celebrity would come in with them to pick out the pieces. One thing I should mention that's important to the story is that for the super luxury brands, we would only rent them out to super A list people (people like Angelina Jolie, Halle Berry, etc). For anyone B list or below we would only allow them to rent mid-size or smaller brands. This particular day, Emmy had come in with her stylist. Her stylist called us a head of time and demanded that we close off the show room to them only…. we don't usually do this, but we did it any ways. I was also told by my boss that Emmy was one of those people who didn't allow people to look at her or speak to her directly. The day Emmy and her stylist came in was a busy day for the actual publicists so I was instructed to help them pick out clothing. They also told me which designer dresses to not allow her to borrow. So Emmy and her stylist come in and while they're selecting items, I'm taking the inventory down. Emmy then gets to the Christian Dior rack and sees a dress she loves. Unfortunately that's one of the designers I'm not supposed to allow her to rent from. I let her stylist know this who then told Emmy. Emmy then starts throwing a full blown temper tantrum and starts yelling at me to the point where both my manager and the owner of the agency come out to calm her down. We then have to lie to her and say that this particular dress is already on hold for someone else. They ended up leaving with the other rented items, but after this the owner of an agency made it a rule that no celebrities are allowed to come in with their stylists. Usually stylists know which designers their clients can and can't wear, and banning clients from the office prevents a lot of drama."

If you dream to emulate this celebrated aesthetic, this exploration will illuminate the secrets behind French style. Delving into the World Through ""Comme"" - Language Immersion Language immersion is a phenomenon that completely submerges you in a new speech. Through participatory engagement, you internalize the nuances of a different language by surrounding yourself in its society. This can involve living in a country where the desired language is spoken, attending conversation schools, or even participating online communities. - Immersion offers a exceptional opportunity to acquire a language at a more profound level than traditional textbook settings allow. - Through dialoguing with native speakers, you refine your aural skills and acquire a authentic understanding of the norms associated with the terms. Upon you submerge yourself in a new dialect, you unlock a wealth of thoughts and stories. Unlocking the Power of ""Comme"": Everyday French Conversations Made Easy Embark on a journey across the fascinating world of everyday French conversation by mastering the versatile word ""comme""|express like. This seemingly simple preposition holds great potential, allowing you to express comparisons, similarities, and even fine points with ease. From describing your favorite meal to showing your feelings about the weather, ""comme""|such as becomes an essential tool in your conversational repertoire. - Alright then explore a few handy ways to incorporate ""comme""|like into your daily French interactions. 4. Comme des Garçons: Deconstructing Haute Couture Comme des Garçons, founded by Rei Kawakubo, stands as a paradoxical force within the realm of fashion. The label consistently challenges traditional notions of beauty and design, juxtaposing elegance with unpredictability. Kawakubo's signature aesthetic often involves deconstructing classic garments, transforming them into fragmented and unconventional silhouettes. Her collections frequently feature a stark palette of black, white, and gray, punctuated by occasional bursts of vibrant shades. This deliberate use of minimalism serves to highlight the architectural and tactile qualities of her creations. Through a series of carefully curated presentations, Kawakubo communicates complex themes that often explore humanity. Her runway shows are not merely fashion displays; they are provocative performances that challenge viewers to reconsider their own perceptions of beauty, normality, and the role of fashion in society. Cultivating Imperfection in Life and Design In a world that often prizes perfection, it's easy to get caught up in the pursuit of something unattainable. But what if we altered our perspective? What if we welcomed the inherent imperfections that make life and design so intriguing? - That - approach recognizes that charm can be found in the unconventional. Consider about a hand-painted ceramic mug with a slightly wonky handle or a vintage dress with a few details. These flaws don't detract from their beauty; instead, they tell a story of experience. In essence, ""comme ça"" is about accepting the complexity of Comme life and design. It's about apprehending grace in the unexpected. 6. The Cultural Significance of ""Comme"" in Francophone Society Within the diverse tapestry of Francophone culture, the seemingly simple word ""comme"" assumes a surprisingly complex role. Far exceeding its literal meaning of ""like"" or ""as,"" it serves as a linguistic chameleon, effortlessly adapting to convey nuances of comparison and even shaping social interactions. From its subtle presence in casual conversations to its more pronounced impact on formal discourse, ""comme"" reveals itself as a fundamental building block of Francophone communication. Consequently, understanding the multifaceted significance of this word unlocks a deeper appreciation for the richness and complexity of the Francophone world."

地址是 1 Rue Bayard, 8th arr., 75008 Paris, France
🇫🇷
酒店在巴黎8区，购物超级超级超级方便！ 蒙田大道就在后面，下楼就到。 位置真的绝佳， 蒙田很好逛，LV，Chanel，BV，Dior都有很大的boutique，货也蛮全的。 如果购物住几天等调货去拿或者送到酒店都OK。 走到香街大概也就10分多钟吧，离乔治五世的Hermes也很近，巴黎一共就3家Hermes，方便拿包。 🍊
离橘园美术馆很近（巴黎我最喜欢的美术馆之一），不到1.5公里，杜乐丽花园也在附近。 走到铁塔大概15分钟。 大部分购物的地方都在附近可以解决，完全不用担心交通，走路都能到。 远一点的出行基本靠Uber，很便捷。 需要早点预定哦。 🗼
最重要的就是选房型啦。 我定的是“Deluxe Double Room with Eiffel Tower View”。 阳台就能很清楚的看到铁塔，合影真是绝了，哈哈。 我后来还换了酒店，很复古很巴黎的一家，之后和大家分享~坦白讲还是这家房间大了很多，而且各方面都很不错，购物实在是很方便。 所以我觉得性价比还是蛮高的。 🤵🏻
服务很好~~很贴心，reception的小哥又帅又热情。 有一万下雨了，我们买了超多东西，帮我们提下车的，后来换酒店好几个大箱子也都帮我们搬上车，特别好。 另一家酒店就毫无服务可言😓

备品用的是法国贵妇小众护肤品牌CODAGE，味道很好闻~设备都很齐全，早餐也很不错。 ❤️

Tears in the booth while he talkin' 'bout pain, But the only real one hurtin' is the mic, not the game. Every album, it's “They hurt me,” “They changed,” “They fake,” Nah bro, it's YOU—still soft-servin' beef on a silver plate. At 38, still throwin' tantrums like a toddler in Dior, Actin' like a “man,” but your soul screamin' encore. And now he's droppin' ICEMAN, think we scared of the freeze? Boy, we heat-seekin' truth, and your ego's diseased. You think you throwin' subs? We caught 'em in slow-mo, Your whole persona meltin', ❄️ you the real snowglobe. Yeah, we know you gon' sneak diss half the game again, In a tone so passive, it sounds like soft rain. You know that we know, and you know it too— A SNOWFLAKE playin' GOD, but we see straight through. Stop throwin' shade at Bron like you got the reach, He'll drop 60 on you, then go chill on the beach. You wanna talk tough? Then lace up, show face, Let the scoreboard decide who really owns space. You wanna beef? Say it direct, like grown men do, Or you gon' cry in your mansion, sippin' tears in the stu? You diss like a ghost, but expect crowns and cheers? Actin' like the king, when you fueled by fears. So here's your mirror, take a long look inside, A man-child in a castle that you built just to hide. No one to blame but your own hollow pride, We done lettin' your drama ride, time to bury the lie. Drake, stop sneakin', stop whinin', stop playin' the clown— We know your whole playbook, now sit tf down."

E-commerce hasn't just disrupted luxury it has filled a Hermes-shaped hole in the retail map. is where Le Corbusier meets Le Couturier. Here, high incomes and even higher social media metrics have turned Madhya Marg and the geri route into an open-air catwalk. Locals track their morning steps on Cartier Santos watches strictly “aesthetic cardio”, mind you. When CLiQ's servers crash at midnight on a sneaker drop, half the IP addresses read “1600xx”. In , it's millionaires, mango pickle and Mercs. With a per-capita income 44 per cent above the national average, boutique gyms offer towel embroidery to match your Dior Book Tote protein shake not included. The Mercedes showroom stays open well into gol-gappa hour; half the test drives are booked online, sight unseen. Karnal goes one better. Once a highway dhaba stop, it now houses a four-storey Luxury Ride depot with 150-plus pre-owned Bentleys and buddies under one roof. Farmers roll in on Range Rovers, trade up to fresher Range Rovers, and still make it back for lassi by dusk. Karnal has gone from Highway Halwa to Highway Dior. , the land of knitwear kings, now boasts 2,500 luxury cars and counting. That's more Mercedes than certain European micro-states. With per-capita income brushing Rs 2 lakh, hosiery wholesalers are swapping yarn counts for carat counts. And Amritsar? Think blessings, Birkins and border-run buyers. Mall Road jewellers never sleep, thanks to well-heeled NRIs. There's a 4,000-sq-ft Malabar Gold flagship store, and fashion chains are muscling in faster than the municipal corporation can widen the pavement. What ties these cities together is a potent cocktail of diaspora dollars, fibre-broadband and Insta-fuelled aspiration. Scroll beats stroll, as high-definition AR try-ons and 48-hour returns simulate the mall experience minus parking. Buy Now Pay Later is the new BFF, melting sticker shock faster than Amritsar's famed jalebi syrup. Micro-influencers from Mohali, say insiders, move more handbags than Bollywood stars. And as rupee wobbles inflate a €2,500 price tag into a Kaun Banega Crorepati question, affordability tools make luxury look less like a splurge and more like smart shopping. With Chandigarh's GDP per capita already nudging Portugal's, and HENRYs  High-Earning-Not-Rich-Yet  popping up every appraisal season, the click-to-chic curve is less rollercoaster and more runway. Karnal's tractor-funded prosperity puts it 15 per cent above the national income average. So what does this mean for legacy brands still hogging space at Emporio Mall? First, polish your Punjabi and Haryanvi. “Size wadda aa?” will outsell any Parisian accent. Authenticity is the new exclusivity. Second, think pop-up over palace. Studio vans orbiting Chandigarh's golf courses during the wedding season move more inventory than a store with a 20-year lease. Small-town India's luxury surge isn't a fad. It's a market correction. Deprive a well-heeled town of physical boutiques, and don't be surprised when its residents overcompensate online. So the next time someone in a metro sneers, “Real fashion happens in ,” remind them: luxury, like good humour and high-speed data, now rolls where tractors once did.

mov_875F6DF48F9D79680C77223E6C1DDA4C,2025-07-06 10:01:50,en,WEB,"  FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) — America's largest trade partner, the European Union, is among the entities awaiting word Monday on whether U.S. President Donald Trump will impose punishing tariffs on their goods, a move economists have warned would have repercussions for companies and consumers on both sides of the Atlantic. Trump imposed a 20% import tax on all EU-made products in early April as part of a set of tariffs targeting countries with which the United States has a trade imbalance. Hours after the nation-specific duties took effect, he put them on hold until July 9 at a standard rate of 10% to quiet financial markets and allow time for negotiations. Expressing displeasure the EU's stance in trade talks, however, the president said he would jack up the tariff rate for European exports to 50%. A rate that high could make everything from French cheese and Italian leather goods to German electronics and Spanish pharmaceuticals much more expensive in the U.S. The EU, whose 27 member nations operate as a single economic bloc, said its leaders hoped to strike a deal with the Trump administration. Without one, the EU said it was prepared to retaliate with tariffs on hundreds of American products, ranging from beef and auto parts to beer and Boeing airplanes. Here are important things to know about trade between the United States and the European Union. US-EU trade is enormous A lot of money is at stake in the trade talks. The EU's executive commission describes the trade between the U.S. and the EU as ""the most important commercial relationship in the world.” The value of EU-U.S. trade in goods and services amounted to 1.7 trillion euros ($2 trillion) in 2024, or an average of 4.6 billion euros a day, according to EU statistics agency Eurostat. The biggest U.S. export to Europe is crude oil, followed by pharmaceuticals, aircraft, automobiles, and medical and diagnostic equipment. Europe's biggest exports to the U.S. are pharmaceuticals, cars, aircraft, chemicals, medical instruments, and wine and spirits. EU sells more to the US than vice versa Trump has complained about the EU's 198 billion-euro ($233 billion) trade surplus in goods, which shows Americans buy more stuff from European businesses than the other way around. However, American companies fill some of the gap by outselling the EU when it comes to services such as cloud computing, travel bookings, and legal and financial services. The U.S. services surplus took the nation's trade deficit with the EU down to 50 billion euros ($59 billion), which represents less than 3% of overall U.S.-EU trade. What are the issues dividing the two sides? Before Trump returned to office, the U.S. and the EU maintained a generally cooperative trade relationship and low tariff levels on both sides. The U.S. rate averaged 1.47% for European goods, while the EU's averaged 1.35% for American products. But the White House has taken a much less friendly posture toward the longstanding U.S. ally since February. Along with the fluctuating tariff rate on European goods Trump has floated, the EU has been subject to his administration's 50% tariff on steel and aluminum and a 25% tax on imported automobiles and parts. Trump administration officials have raised a slew of issues they want to see addressed, including agricultural barriers such as EU health regulations that include bans on chlorine-washed chicken and hormone-treated beef. Trump has also criticized Europe's value-added taxes, which EU countries levy at the point of sale this year at rates of 17% to 27%. But many economists see VAT as trade-neutral since they apply to domestic goods and services as well as imported ones. Because national governments set the taxes through legislation, the EU has said they aren't on the table during trade negotiations. “On the thorny issues of regulations, consumer standards and taxes, the EU and its member states cannot give much ground,” Holger Schmieding, chief economist at Germany's Berenberg bank, said. “They cannot change the way they run the EU's vast internal market according to U.S. demands, which are often rooted in a faulty understanding of how the EU works.” What are potential impacts of higher tariffs? Economists and companies say higher tariffs will mean higher prices for U.S. consumers on imported goods. Importers must decide how much of the extra tax costs to absorb through lower profits and how much to pass on to customers. Mercedes-Benz dealers in the US. have said they are holding the line on 2025 model year prices “until further notice.” The German automaker has a partial tariff shield because it makes 35% of the Mercedes-Benz vehicles sold in the U.S. in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, but the company said it expects prices to undergo “significant increases” in coming years. Simon Hunt, CEO of Italian wine and spirits producer Campari Group, told investment analysts that prices could increase for some products or stay the same depending what rival companies do. If competitors raise prices, the company might decide to hold its prices on Skyy vodka or Aperol aperitif to gain market share, Hunt said. Trump has argued that making it more difficult for foreign companies to sell in the U.S. is a way to stimulate a revival of American manufacturing. Many companies have dismissed the idea or said it would take years to yield positive economic benefits. However, some corporations have proved willing to shift some production stateside. France-based luxury group LVMH, whose brands include Tiffany & Co., Luis Vuitton, Christian Dior and Moet & Chandon, could move some production to the United States, billionaire CEO Bernaud Arnault said at the company's annual meeting in April. Arnault, who attended Trump's inauguration, has urged Europe to reach a deal based on reciprocal concessions. “If we end up with high tariffs, ... we will be forced to increase our U.S.-based production to avoid tariffs,” Arnault said. “And if Europe fails to negotiate intelligently, that will be the consequence for many companies. ... It will be the fault of Brussels, if it comes to that.” Many expect Trump to drop his most drastic demands Some forecasts indicate the U.S. economy would be more at risk if the negotiations fail. Without a deal, the EU would lose 0.3% of its gross domestic product and U.S. GDP would fall 0.7%, if Trump slaps imported goods from Europe with tariffs of 10% to 25%, according to a research review by Bruegel, a think tank in Brussels. Given the complexity of some of the issues, the two sides may arrive only at a framework deal before Wednesday's deadline. That would likely leave a 10% base tariff, as well as the auto, steel and aluminum tariffs in place until details of a formal trade agreement are ironed out...."

Given the complexity of some of the issues, the two sides may arrive only at a framework deal before Wednesday's deadline. That would likely leave a 10% base tariff, as well as the auto, steel and aluminum tariffs in place until details of a formal trade agreement are ironed out...."

mov_664DF439037CF0C2B99E1E9F0965240F,2025-07-06 11:25:18,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]Si scrive Tedx e non ha nulla a vedere con Tex, il fumetto pubblicato dal 1958. È un evento. La «x» finale indica che viene organizzato localmente in modo indipendente, ma su licenza ufficiale concessa da Ted (acronimo di technology, entertainment, design, tecnologia, intrattenimento, design), organismo no profit con sede a New York, fondato nel 1984 da Richard Saul Wurman, architetto e designer, e Harry Marks, esperto di televisione e media. Nella nostra città esiste dal 2014 per iniziativa di Francesco Magagnino: «Alla prima conferenza vennero 150 persone nella sala più piccola della Gran Guardia», ricorda. Oggi in due giorni raduna più di 2.000 partecipanti, mobilita dai 60 agli 80 relatori, organizza oltre 20 laboratori, trova 72 sponsor, impegna 100 volontari. Il tutto all'insegna della gratuità: «Nessuno guadagna nulla». Il team di Tedx Verona, composto da circa 35 professionisti delle più svariate discipline che lavorano pro bono al progetto, è oggi uno dei primi fra i 220 esistenti in Italia. È divenuto talmente importante che il presidente Magagnino nei giorni scorsi è stato nominato dai dirigenti newyorchesi ambassador ufficiale della fondazione per l'Italia, al pari di Emilia Garito di Tedx Roma, ingegnera informatica. Però l'ambasciatore veronese, 43 anni, laureato in ingegneria e in economia all'Università di Trento, sposato con Claudia di Stefano, che lavora in Ibm, padre di Matilde (2 anni) e Olivia (nata a marzo), abituato da 15 anni a dividersi fra Milano e Verona, all'hobby culturale di Tedx ha affiancato un prestigioso incarico professionale: è responsabile per l'Italia, la Grecia e i Paesi dell'Est dell'area Ai (Artificial intelligence) di Accenture Song commerce, la divisione creativa e tecnologica focalizzata su marketing, design, esperienza cliente e trasformazione digitale. In pratica accompagna le aziende nell'uso dell'Intelligenza artificiale, o Ia che dir si voglia, per migliorare la relazione con i loro clienti. Lo fa in questa multinazionale nata dalla fusione delle parole accent e future, sede legale a Dublino, oltre 740.000 dipendenti nel mondo, fatturato annuo intorno ai 65 miliardi di dollari, presente in più di 120 Paesi. Accenture è uno dei colossi della consulenza insieme a Deloitte, Pwc, Kpmg, Ey e McKinsey. Magagnino deve la sua intelligenza naturale al padre Mario, docente nella facoltà di scienze della comunicazione dell'Università di Verona, e alla madre Marilina Sperandio, già insegnante di diritto ed economia all'istituto Pindemonte. Partiamo da Tedx. «C'entra la passione per il mondo digitale. Da bambino misi le mani sul primo computer, un 286 di fabbricazione russa, credo, di quelli con il monitor monocromatico e i caratteri a fosfori verdi su sfondo nero. Lo usavo nell'ufficio di papà per giocare a Tetris su un floppy disk gigante. Al primo anno di superiori mi fu regalato un pc tutto mio». C'è relazione con Tedx? «Sì, perché Tedx è un momento di incontro tra persone che sono appassionate di innovazione digitale. La mia tesi di laurea verteva sui sistemi adattivi, le tecnologie che hanno preceduto quelle di oggi. Partivamo dai modelli usati nella psicoanalisi per studiare la relazione uomo-uomo e li applicavamo alla relazione uomo-macchina». Roba da emicrania. «Due anni e mezzo fa è arrivata l'Intelligenza artificiale generativa, che ha cambiato le regole del gioco. Prima era una faccenda per super esperti, oggi aiuta le imprese a ottimizzare organizzazione e processi produttivi, a creare nuovi servizi. Tre lustri fa avevo vissuto la rivoluzione digitale nelle aziende. Ricorda quando Time nel 1982 mise in copertina il pc e lo proclamò ""Man of the year"", l'uomo dell'anno? Beh, qui siamo a una velocità mai vista prima. Da un cambiamento intergenerazionale siamo passati a uno stagionale». E Tedx lo racconta. «Presenta storie di lavoro, di sacrificio, di persone, di idee. Ha senso condividerle. Ho scoperto realtà aziendali veronesi straordinarie, come Clx, che ogni anno crea 250.000 immagini per Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Gucci, Fendi, Versace, Bulgari, Ferragamo e altre griffe, e per riviste come Vogue, che le usano per pubblicità, app, web e stampa. Ricordo ancora l'avvincente relazione di Massimo Delledonne, professore ordinario di genetica all'Università di Verona, che fu il primo a scrivere la sua tesi di laurea con il pc, mentre i suoi colleghi ancora usavano la Olivetti Lettera 22. Nel 2014 ci preconizzò: ""Un giorno in farmacia ci daranno medicine compatibili con il nostro patrimonio cromosomico"". Aveva sequenziato per anni il Dna di tutti gli esseri viventi, a cominciare dal suo». Perché Ted ha nominato ambassador proprio lei? «L'evento annuale di Verona, del quale sono licenziatario, è uno dei più qualificati in Italia. Nel 2023 vennero qui 300 organizzatori di Tedx nel mondo, persino dall'Argentina, dal Giappone, dai Paesi arabi». Ha ospitato relatori famosi. «Molti. Fra loro, Simon Lancaster, l'ex ghost-writer del premier britannico Tony Blair. La sua relazione sul linguaggio segreto che assicura la leadership a chi raggiunge i vertici della politica e degli affari, tenuta a Tedx Verona nel 2016, finora è stata vista su Youtube da 4,7 milioni di persone». Sfruttate i social. «Parecchio. Abbiamo un pubblico giovane. Impressiona il fatto che a ogni nuovo evento almeno 180 candidati, in prevalenza donne, aderiscano all'appello per venire come volontari ad aiutare in Tedx». Come si chiamano coloro che partecipano a questi incontri? «Qualcuno li definisce tedxers, in italiano tedxari». Ho notato che hanno tutti la barba, tranne lei...."

mov_EBD8FEDEDFB99B5276FD9ED28971D7D0,2025-07-06 11:40:29,pt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[pt]A moda nunca é apenas sobre o que se veste — mas sobre quem veste, onde veste, por que veste. E talvez não exista ocasião melhor para observar essa dinâmica em ação do que durante os grandes eventos culturais do Cariri, como a Festa do Pau da Bandeira, o Juaforró e, claro, a aguardada Expocrato. A cada edição, o que vemos é uma verdadeira passarela a céu aberto, onde a movimentação do público revela mais do que tendências: mostra como identidade, memória e desejo se cruzam na construção do vestir. Em 2025, o que se destaca é a pluralidade. Se antes havia uma separação nítida entre o que era “moda da cidade” e o “estilo do sertão”, hoje esses limites estão cada vez mais borrados — e é aí que mora a riqueza. O streetwear dialoga com o forró raiz, o boho abraça o country, o artesanal invade o urbano. A moda no Cariri não copia: ela reinventa. E o resultado são looks autorais, criativos, e muitas vezes mais relevantes do que os que vemos nas grandes passarelas. Neste momento da temporada fashion, as lojas varejistas do Cariri já começam a lançar suas Coleções Expocrato . Enquanto influenciadores digitais promovem marcas e produtos que, muitas vezes, não refletem a realidade ou o estilo do público que frequenta o evento, os consumidores saem em busca de visuais que combinem com o clima da festa — sem abrir mão do custo-benefício. Conforto ou beleza? Eis a questão que pauta as escolhas do guarda-roupa.   Edição da Expocrato 2025 acontece do dia 11 a 20 de junho. Foto: Divulgação.   Country repaginado: o sertanejo que fala com o pop Não é coincidência que o estilo western esteja em alta. A cultura pop tem jogado luz sobre o country com narrativas que atualizam seus códigos visuais — como fez Beyoncé em Cowboy Carter , misturando herança negra, orgulho texano e estética maximalista. E ela não está sozinha: artistas como Lil Nas X, Dua Lipa e Post Malone também embarcaram nessa vibe western , misturando tradição e modernidade nos palcos e videoclipes. A tendência ultrapassou o universo musical e chegou às telas. Séries como Yellowstone (2018–2024) e Godless (2017), ambientadas no Oeste americano do século XIX, ajudaram a reacender o fascínio por esse visual rústico. Já nas passarelas, o xadrez — presença obrigatória no guarda-roupa sertanejo — apareceu com força na coleção Cruise 2025 , da marca francesa Dior, mostrando que até o luxo de grife se rende ao charme do country.   Coleção Cruise 2025, da marca Dior. Foto: Divulgação.   O sertanejo remixado  No Cariri, a moda western ganha uma releitura moderna e funcional, adaptada ao calor, ao ritmo dos eventos e ao estilo de quem frequenta festas como a Expocrato. Coturnos e botas de cano alto são os queridinhos da vez, assim como saias de couro, jaquetas de camurça, calças jeans de cintura alta e cintos com fivelas marcantes. A combinação certa entre esses elementos garante um visual estiloso, sem abrir mão do conforto necessário para dançar e curtir. O varejo local oferece conjuntos completos inspirados no western por preços que cabem no bolso — a partir de R$ 250. Já plataformas online, como a Shein, disponibilizam calças de couro ecológico por cerca de R$ 150. A dica é investir em peças-chave que podem ser reaproveitadas em outras ocasiões, como uma boa bota ou um cinto com design diferenciado. Para completar as composições, vale apostar em acessórios com pegada boho ou rústica : brincos de argola, colares com pedras naturais, lenços no pescoço e até bolsas com franjas. O importante é montar um visual que una identidade, conforto e ousadia — com o carimbo do Cariri.   Inspirações de visuais que fazem referência ao country repaginado. Foto: Reprodução/Pinterest.   Boho chic: o charme vintage que conquista o sertão Cores terrosas, estampas orgânicas, tecidos leves e um toque de suavidade definem o estilo boho — uma moda que une liberdade e sofisticação. Com elementos em comum com a estética country, como botas, acessórios marcantes e jeans, o boho pode facilmente se misturar a ela. Mas suas origens são distintas: ele nasce da influência dos artistas folk, indie e hippies dos anos 1970, incorporando referências românticas, vintage e boêmias. Um dos maiores ícones recentes dessa estética é a personagem Daisy Jones, da série Daisy Jones & The Six , da Amazon Prime Video. Ambientada na Los Angeles dos anos 70, a série retrata o visual boho de forma fiel e encantadora: vestidos fluidos, calças flare, batas leves e tops camponeses compõem um estilo despojado, mas cheio de atitude e glamour nostálgico. Nas passarelas, a marca francesa Chloé é uma das principais representantes do boho chic contemporâneo. Seus desfiles de 2025 reafirmam a tendência com peças como vestidos esvoaçantes, batas com babados, sandálias gladiadoras e franjas delicadas — tudo isso em tons naturais que remetem ao deserto, à terra e à natureza.    ..."

And what engaging scuffles among the living! In all of these, however, we learn useful lessons – especially for the discerning. More will come because the stream of rejoinders is unceasing, unending, unrelenting! Everyone who has something useful to say is welcome! Enjoy this first part! “Having just read your write-up on the issue of demolition of the cenotaph at Owo, I cannot but salute you once again and greatly appreciate your sense of goodwill and marvelous manner of journalism! Now, the crux of the matter, as rightly stated, is that “the decision to site the structure in that particular location was resisted by the Olowo-in-Council and frowned upon by the people of the community when it was being conceived by the government of the late governor, Arakunrin Akeredolu” (See also Festus Adedayo's FLICKERS column in the same Sunday Tribune edition of 29 June, 2025 at page 3). That being so, the whole faux pax can be attributed to the usual arrogance and “what can they do?” mentality of state governors! Lo, the governors usually forget that they would not be in that position forever! How could the governor refuse to respect the sensitivity of the traditional ruler on an issue like this; while at the same time mouthing it that traditional rulers are the custodians of tradition, who are also closer to the people? – Elder Makanjuola Olaitan. You took me through a journey! Destination arrived safely! I often wonder why we allow emotions to rule over the greater good! – Bamidele Ajiboye. This is to let you know that I follow and appreciate your column avidly. Besides, this intervention is to set the records straight as quotes and data from your writings become veritable sources of history tomorrow. In your piece on “Revisiting Akeredolu's cenotaph of controversy”, you dwelt extensively on the first cement block house in Owo. To be precise and correct, the first cement block house in Owo was built by Chief S. B. Aruwajoye in 1947 at No 9, Owaluwa Square, Owo. It was not necessarily the first two-storey building in the town but was popular because of the novel fancy block of its external walls. Chief Alabi's house at Igboroko Street, definitely an architectural masterpiece of its time, came later in the early 1950s. I did not point this fact out earlier because it would have been distracting to the issues being discussed at the time. – Akin Aruwajoye. Why not just remove the Memorial symbol where the names of the victims and the epitaph are placed to another agreeable location and remodel the place to a relaxation public park, instead of demolition and obvious waste of public funds? Anyway, it is not their money! Tunji Alapini (Police AIG rtd.) . Nothing settles this dangerous matter better than this your article! – Durotimi Adeboye. Black is a colour that nobody wears in Buckingham Palace. Princess Diana's first sin was that when she went on her first official shopping, after her engagement to then Prince Charles, she bought a very beautiful black Christian Dior dress! l think that's the culture all over the world. Royalty and or royal eyes do not behold death. If not, “bawo ni irukere fi maa gbo”? Our late “Great lfe” friend, Arakurin Oluwarotimi Odunayo Akeredolu, and his wife were too haughty for their own eternal good. – Chris Abugo. Thanks for your submission! – Damola Oshodi. The big question is: Why not dismantle the building? The answer is: Not much can be salvaged when you try to dismantle a house. If you chisel the wall, the pressure will break the glasses. Not much could have been salvaged. Regardless, our former governor made a terrible mistake in the first instance by building the cenotaph on Omasan street. His intention was to demolish virtually all the buildings on that stretch, including my father's house (Chief Aruwaji). Ogwa had to let him know that the building on that stretch includes the building owned by Olagbegi and Aruwaji families. Ologho as per tradition dances around Ogho during Igogo festival and he stops by to pay homage to the memories of the two respective families...."

富豪榜正在洗牌中，權力新局早已悄悄上演。 2025 年 7 月《Forbes》全球富豪榜正式揭曉，Bernard Arnault 帶著精品帝國穩穩壓陣、Google 雙帥悄悄回歸，94 歲的巴菲特依舊穩坐榜中長青。 這份榜單不是數字遊戲，是時代氣味的風向球。 點進來，看誰穩坐金色王座，誰又悄悄超車成為今年最大贏家，還有誰正在悄悄改寫世界的走向。 2025年全球最富有的10位富豪1. Elon Musk- 約 $4065 億美元
誰是地表最強有錢人？ 非伊隆·馬斯克莫屬！ 這位科技狂人一手打造特斯拉電動車和 SpaceX 太空夢工廠。 雖然 Tesla 股價下滑讓他損失 160 億，但以 4065 億美元身價，依然高坐全球首富寶座。 2025年全球最富有的10位富豪2. Larry Ellison –約 $2622 億美元
得力於雲端與 AI 基礎設施需求攀升，以及與 OpenAI-Stargate 等重大合約推動，使得 Oracle 財報亮眼帶動股價飆升，這位甲骨文軟體教父 Larry Ellison 淨資產短短幾天增逾 400 億美元，達約 250–2600 億美元，更直接超車 Zuckerberg 以及 Jeff Bezos ，奪下全球第二富豪寶座。 2025年全球最富有的10位富豪3. Mark Zuckerberg –約 $2,546 億美元
近期這位 Meta 創辦人 Mark Zuckerberg 斥資約 149–150 億美元取得 Scale AI 49% 股權，並延攬 Scale AI 創辦人 AI 專家，進一步推動 Meta 股價和 Zuckerberg 個人身價上升，在今年 6月就大賺 310 億美元， 以$2,546 億美元身家躍居全球富豪榜第三，與此還一手掌控著 Facebook、Instagram 和 WhatsApp 等平台。 2025年全球最富有的10位富豪4. Jeff Bezos –約 $2,334億美元
Amazon 創辦人 Jeff Bezos 現以約2330億美元財富位居全球富豪第四。 儘管卸任多年，依舊靠著 Amazon 股價在今年 6 月幫他加持 130 億美元。 如今他轉型當太空旅人，還創立了太空探索公司藍色起源（Blue Origin），並收購了《華盛頓郵報》。 2025年全球最富有的10位富豪5. Warren Buffett –約 $1516億美元
94 歲的巴菲特是富豪榜上最長青的傳奇，他掌管的 Berkshire Hathaway公司涵蓋從可樂、電池Duracell、保險公司Geico 到冰淇淋，累積約1516億美元財富。 先前他也宣布將於 2025 年底要退休 CEO 職務，並承諾捐出99%的財富做慈善，與 Bill Gates 比爾‧蓋茨發起「捐贈誓言」，號召億萬富翁們把錢回饋社會。 2025年全球最富有的10位富豪6. Larry Page –約 $1459億美元
Google 共同創辦人 Larry Page 低調挺進富豪榜前列。 52歲的他雖辭去 Alphabet 執行長，仍是 Google 幕後大股東，坐擁1440億美元家產。 近期則是熱衷未來科技：投資小行星採礦、飛行車等。 2025年全球最富有的10位富豪7. Steve Ballmer –約 $1,412億美元
微軟前 CEO Steve Ballmer 現在是 NBA 球場上最富有的球迷！ 69歲的他身家1180億美元，當年在微軟賺得盆滿缽滿，如今豪擲鉅資以20億美元買下洛杉磯快艇隊，創下了當時NBA球隊的最高紀錄，如今球隊價值翻倍，《富比士》 目前對該隊的估值為55億美元，也讓他成功轉化為另一種文化影響力。 2025年全球最富有的10位富豪8. Sergey Brin –約 $1,395億美元
Google 另一位創辦人 Sergey Brin 財富同樣驚人，身家達1,395億美元。 51歲的他雖淡出公司管理，目前擔任Google母公司 Alphabet 的董事會成員，受惠於 Alphabet 股價因 AI 發展表現強勁，使他身家在短期內增加約 90～95 億美元。 先前他結束半退休狀態，投入 Gemini AI 聊天機器人開發中，被列為模型的核心貢獻者之一，持續在為 Google 的未來航向提供著無可取代的羅盤。 2025年全球最富有的10位富豪9. Bernard Arnault –約 $1,384 億美元
法國LVMH集團掌門人 Bernard Arnault 以約1384億美元身價位列第9。 其所擁有的 LVMH 集團把 Louis Vuitton、Dior等無數大牌收入麾下，打造出奢侈品王國，也是榜單上唯一的非美籍富豪。 他的五個子女全部活躍於 LVMH 帝國，時尚圈上演現代版「豪門繼承者們」。 今年 5 月，LVMH 股價一日暴漲 6.4%，為他帶來約 94 億美元 的即時財富增值，身家一度飆升至約 1,560 億美元。 不過，隨著 6 月傳出中國消費放緩與潛在關稅問題，LVMH 營利下滑，股價回調使 Arnault 洪峰後稍退，淨值目前穩定在約1380億美元上下。 2025年全球最富有的10位富豪10. 黃仁勳（Jensen Huang）–約 $1,376 億美元
身穿經典黑皮衣的 NVIDIA 執行長黃仁勳，靠 AI 晶片狂潮成為本榜最大黑馬！ 隨著 NVIDIA 股價飆到新高，市值逼近 3.9 兆美元，今年 6月他的財富暴增 200 億美元，身價升至約1370億美元，衝上第10名 。"

In celebration of its 10th anniversary, Apple Music unveiled its official list of the most-streamed songs of all time, spotlighting tracks that have garnered the highest plays on the platform since its inception. Among the global chart-toppers, Wizkid and Tems stood tall as the top-performing African artists, cementing their legacy in the international music space. Wizkid, through his 2016 global smash hit “One Dance” with Drake and Kyla, emerged as the highest-ranked African act on the all-time chart. The collaboration not only took over global charts upon release but has continued to enjoy immense streaming success almost a decade later, highlighting Wizkid's enduring influence. Tems, on the other hand, made history as the highest-ranked and only female African artist on the all-time list. Her Grammy-winning appearance on “Wait For U,” a collaboration with Future and Drake, catapulted her to new heights. The song, released in 2022, received widespread acclaim and reinforced her global appeal. Beyond the streaming milestones, Tems has also been in the spotlight for her impactful contributions to women in music. Her recently launched initiative aims to empower and support female creatives across Africa's music industry—adding a layer of purpose to her already impressive artistic journey. With this achievement, Wizkid and Tems have once again elevated Afrobeats and African music to the global stage, reinforcing the continent's growing dominance in mainstream music conversations.

mov_D6B600AF96DE06538F9D2CEED5828653,2025-07-06 15:55:00,en,WEB,"  Rihanna is glowing — and no, it's not just the baby bump. As she prepares to welcome her third child with A$AP Rocky, the Fenty founder and Smurfs star is getting a whole lot of love, support, and late-night snack deliveries from her partner of five years. According to People, the couple is “thrilled” to be growing their family again, and sources close to the pair say this pregnancy feels different — softer, slower, and somehow even more full of love. “He's completely tuned into her needs,” the insider shared of Rocky, who's been “incredibly attentive and nurturing” as Rihanna rests and gets ready for baby no. 3. Related story Rihanna's Baby Bump Is on Full Display at the Met Gala After Revealing Her 3rd Pregnancy While some dads might think diaper duty earns them a gold star, Rocky's in full-service mode. He's reportedly handling bedtime routines, entertaining sons RZA, 3, and Riot Rose, almost 2, and running baths for Rihanna at the end of the day. Yes, baths. With foot rubs. And snacks. “He always makes her laugh,” the source added. “He keeps things light and full of love.” ASAP Rocky, Rihanna at the Dior Homme show as part of Paris Men's Fashion Week on June 27, 2025 in Paris. Swan Gallet/WWD The couple revealed the pregnancy just ahead of the 2025 Met Gala — in true Rihanna fashion, by casually stepping out of The Carlyle in a powder-blue two-piece with her bump on full display. It marked her third major pregnancy reveal in as many years, following her viral 2023 Super Bowl moment and her first pregnancy announcement in 2022, when she wore a $29K outfit in a paparazzi photo, per Us Weekly. Still, this time seems more intimate. Back in December, Rihanna joked that the only thing she hadn't achieved yet was having a daughter. “I'm batting at 75 percent for a boy next time,” she told E! News. “So, we'll just keep our fingers crossed.” And in April, she doubled down: “I would try for my girl,” she told Interview. “But of course, if it's another boy, it's another boy.” Either way, Rocky's right there next to her. Even if he doesn't help dress the kids — “That's their mother by herself,” he admitted last year — he still plays muse. “Sometimes she dresses them like me… kilts and all of that,” he said. Now, with a third baby on the way and a nightly foot rub seemingly locked in, it's safe to say this might be Rihanna's coziest pregnancy yet.

The 41-year-old revealed earlier this year that she had underwent surgery for endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, which can potentially lead to infertility and other complications. Alexa was diagnosed with the condition in July 2020, calling her experience in getting treatment ""frustrating"" while services were ""under-funded"". In April 2025, the Popworld presenter confirmed her first Vinted sale drop, in which she flogged items from her own wardrobe in order to raise money for Endometriosis UK, prompting millennial hysteria. She has since taken part in other drops, with the latest confirmed in the video she shared to TikTok on Wednesday (July 2). ""I'll be selling things such as these glorious boots,"" Alexa told viewers in front of a backdrop featuring the piar of black, leather Prada boots. ""I literally love them, they've served me very well but they've gotta go. Because, the proceeds go to Endometriosis UK, which is, of course, very close to my womb, I guess. ""There's load of other amazing things in there [the drop], they've got a Dior bag - a really nice, 90s red sequence dress. And I want to say thank you so much if you bought things last time."" More than 1.5million people in the UK live with the condition, roughly one in 10 women. Since her diagnosis, Alexa has continued to campaign and raise awareness for Endometriosis UK. Speaking earlier this year, Alexa told The Telegraph how she had underwent a laparoscopy, where the pelvis is accessed through small incisions, to cut out the affected tissue to try and aid her symptoms. For more stories like this subscribe to our weekly newsletter, The Weekly Gulp, for a curated roundup of trending stories, poignant interviews, and viral lifestyle picks from The Mirror's Audience U35 team delivered straight to your inbox. ""A number of years ago, I had a laparoscopy to help cure it,"" She explained. ""They don't really know how to cure endometriosis but they do like cutting it out of people quite a lot, just on the off chance that it might work. ""I do come up against this wall, where no matter how helpful or amazing the doctors I've seen have been, you reach a point in the cul-de-sac of information where you realise there's a definitive end to the amount of treatment they can give you. I find it super frustrating. It's part of a canon of women's health issues that are desperately under-researched,"" she added. Help us improve our content by completing the survey below.

mov_27BE02CBCEF34829295F83084B026868,2025-07-06 16:29:20,en,WEB,"  After a year of musical chairs in fashion, September is gearing up to be one of its biggest show months ever: with debut collections slated from new creative directors at brands including Matthieu Blazy at Chanel and ex-Balenciaga designer Demna at Gucci. On Sunday in Paris, Michael Rider, who recently succeeded Hedi Slimane at Celine, decided to get a head start. Acting as a sort of amuse bouche for how he plans to shape the brand's future, Rider showed a mixture of men's and womenswear. The show took place at the brand's sprawling atelier, a short hop from the Tuileries Garden. Guests included the actor Naomi Watts and, fresh from 18 months of South Korean military service, Kim Taehyung, from the K-pop band BTS, who attempted to shelter from the rain under a giant silk foulard that had been erected above a courtyard. It was a full-circle moment for Rider, an American designer who previously worked under Phoebe Philo during her tenure at the brand from 2008 to 2017. While fans of her work, known as “Philophiles”, had hoped Rider would reinstate that era of louche tailoring and minimalism, his opening looks quickly curtailed such expectations. Instead of oversized silhouettes, there was a series of skinny jeans and even skinner trousers, hugging calves so tightly, they should have come with a circulation warning. These lean silhouettes were a nod to his predecessor, Slimane, who honed his signature sharp-edged style during his stints at Saint Laurent and Dior Homme before introducing it to Celine. Despite initial criticism, Slimane proved lucrative for Celine's parent company LVMH. According to analysts, he was estimated to have doubled Celine's annual sales to €2.5bn (£2.1bn), transforming it into LVMH's third-largest brand, sitting behind Louis Vuitton and Dior. However, in October, he resigned with rumours of failed contract negotiations to blame. It's now up to Rider to pick up that moneyed baton. Rider's appointment comes at a difficult time in the fashion industry, with a significant slowdown across luxury markets (for the first quarter of 2025, LVMH reported a 4% sales drop across fashion and leather goods). At the annual general meeting in April 2024, LVMH's chief executive, Bernard Arnault, said: “Celine is chic, hip, sexy fashion for young people even if the prices are what they are, and it works.” Rather than wiping the slate clean, during this period of uncertainty, it appears that Rider is set on evolving on the brand's existing tried and tested formula. Speaking backstage after the show, Rider said he “did not want there to be a sense of erasure”, adding that “there was a foundation to build on. That to me felt modern, it felt ethical, it felt strong.” Rider balanced this homage to the past by intertwining it with his own fashion story. There were nods to his American roots and recent stint as design director of Polo Ralph Lauren, with punchy, coloured knitted V-neck jumpers, neat Oxford shirts and striped ties. Simple evening looks in black including an off-the-shoulder dress and satin lapelled blazers seemed to subtly recall his previous time at Celine. Accessories, which are easier for luxury brands to shift than a £5k coat, were a focus. Models' fingers came covered in multiple gold and primary coloured rings. Chunky bangles were stacked on forearms. Giant chain link necklaces were mishmashed. Keyrings jingled with everything from dices to miniature Eiffel Towers. Rider said he wanted to inject an element of fun. “I would never want to be perceived as cynical. Having a sense of humour in the luxury space is a beautiful thing,” he said. Bags ranging from colossal woven baskets and enormous leather totes to dainty pouches were emblazoned with logos ranging from a simple C to a “Triomphe” monogram, first created by the house's founder Céline Vipiana in 1971. Rider said he was drawn to a logo's fluid nature. “They can move from something really tasteful to quickly something that is very different from that. They can be many things.”"

For the artist, every appearance is an excuse to adorn herself with beautiful pieces. But a fashion show? That's when she takes her jewelry to a whole other level. Rihanna has worn a lot of extraordinary pieces over the years, but we couldn't take our eyes off the pearl and cameo necklace that served as a centerpiece for her look at Dior.

I love the prequel skincare line (have it at target, on their website, and on Amazon), and it's safe for most skin types. The cleanser is fantastic (called the glenser), and they also have a makeup removing oil (haven't tried it yet). They also have a great milkey toner, and a hydrating serum called the quench. Good luck!"

I've been to events before, but this one felt... different. Intimate. Magical. Deeply cultural. Have you ever walked into a room and felt like you were stepping into someone's fairytale? Phones Down, Glam On Before entering the venue, we were asked to seal our phones in small plastic pouches — no cameras, no social media, no distractions. At first, I felt the reflex to reach for my phone, to capture something, anything... but then I realized: maybe this night isn't meant to be captured. Maybe it's meant to be lived. Would you be okay giving up your phone for the night if it meant being fully present? An Entrance Fit for a Queen To the right: a mini salon for touch-ups. To the left: a coffee bar with Arabic blends and Turkish tea. And everywhere in between: fresh flowers, oversized mirrors, and perfume stations filled with Chanel, Dior, and elegant oud blends that lingered in the air like poetry. Before stepping into the event hall, we were in abayas. But just before entering, we gracefully took them off, revealing our evening gowns — each one more stunning than the next. Mine was a sparkly silver piece, but honestly? Every woman in that room looked like art. A Celebration of Femininity and Tradition We greeted one another cheek to cheek, guided to our table by the bride's sister. Even the servers wore pressed uniforms, gracefully pouring endless cups of karak and herbal tea. Everything was intentional — from the Narumi bone china plates to the floral centerpieces that stood tall like sculptures. And the food? Think creamy hummus, beef stew, chicken biryani, sambusa, and more. But more than taste, it was the energy of being surrounded by women in full bloom — confident, graceful, glowing — that truly fed my soul. Have you ever felt beauty in a room so strongly, it didn't need to be said out loud? Then She Walked In... The bride entered like a vision — her dress glittering like stardust, her pace soft and steady. Romantic music filled the room. Big screens framed her walk to the stage. She looked like she belonged in a fairytale, but one grounded in heritage and pride. There was a collective pause, a silent awe — the kind you don't interrupt. A Shift in Energy Later, we were asked to wear our abayas again — the groom and his family were about to arrive. The vibe shifted: a little more formal, a little more sacred. I watched as he gazed at the bride, visibly in love. And though no photos were allowed, that moment will live in my memory far longer than anything I could've posted. What This Night Taught Me It reminded me that sometimes, the most beautiful moments are the ones we don't capture. That elegance isn't about extravagance — it's about intention. And that when women come together in celebration, something powerful happens. Would you say yes to attending a wedding like this if invited? Would you leave your phone behind and trust the moment to hold itself? Let's Talk: Have you ever experienced a wedding that made you feel something this deeply? Or have you ever been to a cultural celebration that opened your eyes to a new kind of beauty? I'd love to hear your story — leave a comment or DM me on Instagram."

But I wrote this a while back Monica Geller-Bing Career – After adopting Jack and Erica with Chandler, Monica worked part-time as a catering chef to spend more time at home. – As the kids grew older, she opened Monica's Kitchen, a catering company specialising in family dinners and events. – She has won New York's Best Home Chef twice and teaches cooking classes on weekends. Family – Jack and Erica are now teenagers. Jack loves basketball and plays for his school team, while Erica loves photography and dreams of working for National Geographic. – Monica is the ultimate organised mom – planning healthy meals, colour-coding calendars, and volunteering at their school. Marriage – She and Chandler are still strong. Monica knows he doesn't always understand her need for perfection, but he loves her for it. – Every autumn, they go away for a weekend in Vermont to reconnect and drink wine by the fireplace. Home – They still live in Westchester in the house they moved to after adopting the twins. Monica has remodelled the kitchen three times to get it “just right.” Chandler Bing Career – Chandler stayed in advertising but transitioned to a more creative writing role after feeling burnt out.

mov_73128F4F605401BDB64B9B418DCB4B50,2025-07-06 20:29:43,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Nach einem Jahr voller Musikstühle in der Mode ist der September eine seiner größten Showmonate aller Zeiten aller Zeiten vorbereitet: mit Debütsammlungen, die von neuen kreativen Direktoren bei Marken wie Matthieu Blazy bei Chanel und Ex-Balenciaga-Designer Demna bei Gucci abgefeuert wurden. Am Sonntag in Paris beschloss Michael Rider, der kürzlich Hedi Slimane bei Celine nachfolgt, einen Vorsprung. In einer Amuse-Bouche für die Art und Weise, wie er die Zukunft der Marke gestalten will, zeigte Rider eine Mischung aus Männern und Damenbekleidung. Die Show fand im weitläufigen Atelier der Marke statt, einem kurzen Sprung vom Tuileries Garden. Zu den Gästen gehörten der Schauspieler Naomi Watts und frisch aus 18 Monaten südkoreanischer Militärdienst, Kim Taehyung, von der K-Pop-Band BTS, die versuchte, unter einer riesigen Seide vor dem Regen zu schützen Das war über einem Innenhof errichtet worden. Für Rider, eine amerikanische Designerin, die zuvor während ihrer Amtszeit bei der Marke von 2008 bis 2017 unter Phoebe Philo arbeitete, war es ein Vollkreismoment. Während Fans ihrer Arbeit, bekannt als „Philophile“, gehofft hatten, dass Rider diese Ära der Louche -Schneiderei und des Minimalismus wieder einstellen würde, hat seine Eröffnungsaussehen solche Erwartungen schnell eingeschränkt. Anstelle von übergroßen Silhouetten gab es eine Reihe von Skinny -Jeans und sogar Skinner -Hosen, die Kälber so fest umarmten, dass sie mit einer Aufzirkulationswarnung einhergehen sollen. Diese mageren Silhouetten waren eine Anspielung auf seinen Vorgänger Slimane, der seinen charakteristischen, scharfkantigen Stil während seiner Stationen in Saint Laurent und Dior Homme verbesserte, bevor er ihn Celine vorstellte. Trotz anfänglicher Kritik erwies sich Slimane für die Muttergesellschaft LVMH von Celine lukrativ. Laut Analysten wurde er schätzungsweise den Jahresumsatz von Celine auf 2,5 Mrd. EUR (2,1 Mrd. GBP) verdoppelt und ihn hinter Louis Vuitton und Dior in die drittgrößte Marke von LVMH verwandelt. Im Oktober trat er jedoch unter Gerüchten über gescheiterte Vertragsverhandlungen zurück. Es liegt jetzt an Rider, diesen Geldstab zu holen. Die Ernennung von Rider erfolgt zu einer schwierigen Zeit in der Modebranche, wobei die Luxusmärkte erheblich verlangsamt haben (im ersten Quartal von 2025 meldete LVMH einen Umsatzrückgang von 4% gegenüber Mode- und Lederwaren). Auf der Jahreshauptversammlung im April 2024 sagte der Geschäftsführer von LVMH, Bernard Arnault,: „Celine ist schick, hip, sexy Mode für junge Menschen, auch wenn die Preise so sind, wie sie sind, und es funktioniert. “ Anstatt den Schiefer in dieser Zeit der Unsicherheit sauber zu löschen, scheint es, dass sich der Fahrer an der vorhandenen bewährten Formel der Marke weiterentwickelt. Nach der Show hinter der Bühne sagte Rider und sagte, er wollte nicht, dass es ein Gefühl der Löschung gibt “und fügte hinzu, dass” es eine Grundlage gibt, auf der ich mich aufbauen kann. Das fühlte sich modern, es fühlte sich ethisch an, es fühlte sich stark an. “ Rider balancierte diese Hommage an die Vergangenheit, indem er sie mit seiner eigenen modischen Geschichte verflechtete. Es gab Anspielungen auf seine amerikanischen Wurzeln und seine jüngste Zeit als Designdirektor von Polo Ralph Lauren, mit druckvollen, gefärbten Strick-Jumpern mit V-Ausschnitt, ordentlichen Oxford-Hemden und gestreiften Krawatten. Einfacher Abend sieht schwarz aus, einschließlich eines schulterfreien Kleides und der satinrafschen Blazer schienen sich an seine frühere Zeit bei Celine auf subtile Weise zu erinnern. Zubehör, die für Luxusmarken einfacher sind als ein Mantel von 5.000 Pfund, waren ein Fokus. Die Finger der Modelle wurden mit mehreren goldenen und primären farbigen Ringen bedeckt. Klobige Armreifen wurden auf Unterarmen gestapelt. Riesenkettenverbindungsketten wurden misshandelt. Keyrings schlängten mit allem, von Würfel bis zu Miniatur -Eiffeltürmen. Rider sagte, er wolle ein Element des Spaßes einbringen. “Ich würde niemals als zynisch empfunden werden. Ein Sinn für Humor im Luxusraum ist eine schöne Sache”, sagte er. Taschen, die von kolossalen gewebten Körben und riesigen Lederbeuteln bis hin zu zierlichen Beuteln reichen, wurden mit Logos, die von einem einfachen C bis zu einem „Triomphe“ -Monogramm reichen, das 1971 vom Gründer Céline Vipiana des Hauses erstellt wurde. Rider sagte, er sei von der fließenden Natur eines Logos angezogen. “Sie können sich von etwas, das wirklich Geschmackvolles zu etwas, das sich sehr davon unterscheidet, übergehen. Sie können viele Dinge sein.” Tags: PrevPreviousElder: Andere Präsidenten beschwerten"

Demna, known for his daring work as well as controversies during his decade-long stint at Kering-owned Balenciaga, will unveil his final collection on Wednesday in what is expected to be one of the highlights of the week. Not to be confused with Paris Fashion Week, Haute Couture Week takes place exclusively in Paris — in January for spring-summer collections and July for autumn-winter. It is a uniquely French event dedicated to handcrafted, one-of-a-kind creations made to wear at red carpets, galas, and other high-profile events. The 44-year-old Demna, acclaimed by millennials and Gen-Z stars from Kim Kardashian to British pop sensation Charli XCX, has been tasked with reviving the flagging fortunes of Gucci by Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault. After multiplying sales at Balenciaga, where he made headlines with a $2,000 ""Ikea"" bag and a $1,800 so-called ""trash pouch"", he is currently being honoured with an exhibition titled ""Balenciaga by Demna"" at Kering's Paris headquarters. He will be succeeded by Italian designer Pierpaolo Piccioli, who is set to present his first collection in October during Paris Women's Fashion Week. As usual, Schiaparelli will open Couture Week, followed later in the day by shows from Iris Van Herpen —- returning after a year-long break -— as well as Georges Hobeika, Imane Ayissi, Rahul Mishra, Julie de Libran, and Giambattista Valli. After Demna's farewell on Wednesday, Belgian designer Glenn Martens will find himself in the spotlight as he unveils a first collection for Maison Margiela following his appointment in January to succeed British designer John Galliano. American designer Michael Rider, who succeeded Hedi Slimane as chief designer at Celine, unveiled his first collection for the luxury French brand on Sunday, outside the official calendar. – Absences – On Tuesday, Chanel will present the final collection created by its in-house design studio, the fifth since Virginie Viard's sudden departure in June 2024. More in Style Her successor, the discreet and highly respected Franco-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy, was appointed in December and will showcase his first collection for Chanel in October. Up to Thursday, 27 houses will unveil their creations, including Elie Saab, Armani Prive, Aelis, Viktor&Rolf, Adeline Andre, and Dubai-based Rami Al Ali who is set to become the first Syrian to join the official calendar. Following a spate of major changes at fashion houses, some absences will stand out, particularly Dior's. After a highly anticipated debut during the men's Fashion Week on June 27, newly appointed artistic director Jonathan Anderson is holding back his first haute couture collection for January 2026. Named in early June to lead Dior's women's and couture lines as well, the 40-year-old Northern Irishman has become the first person since founder Christian Dior himself to oversee all three branches of the house. Jean Paul Gaultier is also missing. Dutch designer Duran Lantink, appointed as the brand's permanent artistic director in April, will make his debut during Women's Fashion Week in October. Since stepping back in 2020, Jean Paul Gaultier has handed over the reins of his couture collections to a series of guest designers, including Olivier Rousteing, Ludovic de Saint Sernin, Haider Ackermann, and Simone Rocha. The week will wrap up with a show by Swiss designer Kevin Germanier. mdv-adp/gv/tc"

A disputa pelo topo do ranking dos bilionários do planeta segue intensa e com reviravoltas de tirar o fôlego. Em julho de 2025, Bernard Arnault, o magnata francês do luxo por trás do império LVMH, desbancou Elon Musk e reassumiu a liderança como o homem mais rico do mundo. Com uma fortuna de impressionantes US$ 227,6 bilhões, Arnault vê seu patrimônio impulsionado pelas ações de grifes como Louis Vuitton e Dior. ++ Enquanto isso, Elon Musk, que por muito tempo dominou o primeiro lugar graças à Tesla e à SpaceX, agora ocupa a segunda posição com US$ 212,6 bilhões. Já Jeff Bezos, fundador da Amazon, continua na terceira colocação, com US$ 204,7 bilhões, consolidando seu posto com a força da gigante do varejo digital. Mas uma nova surpresa chama atenção no ranking: Mark Zuckerberg, criador do Facebook, teve o maior salto de riqueza no ano, somando mais de US$ 114 bilhões desde janeiro e ocupando agora a quarta posição, com US$ 176,3 bilhões. O top 10 ainda traz nomes de peso como Larry Ellison (Oracle), Warren Buffett (Berkshire Hathaway), Bill Gates (Microsoft) e Steve Ballmer, que também fez fortuna com a gigante da tecnologia. Destaque também para os irmãos indianos Mukesh Ambani, do setor petroquímico, e Gautam Adani, que retorna ao ranking após enfrentar duras perdas em 2023.

(Image: Barbour ) English model and TV presenter, Alexa Chung has confirmed she will be selling her clothes on Vinted, telling fans on TikTok proceeds will be going to a cause ""very close to my womb"". The 41-year-old revealed earlier this year that she had underwent surgery for endometriosis, a condition where tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus, which can potentially lead to infertility and other complications. Alexa was diagnosed with the condition in July 2020, calling her experience in getting treatment ""frustrating"" while services were ""under-funded"". In April 2025, the Popworld presenter confirmed her first Vinted sale drop, in which she flogged items from her own wardrobe in order to raise money for Endometriosis UK, prompting millennial hysteria.
