mov_336FCC67B1C0B2E38F359A3781E781E2,2025-06-16 11:31:44,en,WEB,"  An Irish couple has unmasked the man behind Tattle Life after suing website The anonymous blogger who made money running a gossip site dubbed a 'trolls' paradise' has been revealed to be a male vegan food influencer - after a two-year legal battle saw an Irish couple successfully get £300,000 in damages after suing the publisher. A 41-year-old English man called Sebastian Bond is now confirmed to be behind Tattle Life, a forum which became synonymous with venomous posts about influencers, A-listers and anyone in the public eye; spurred on by countless of accounts sporting vague, untraceable usernames. Users dissect and annihilate, every minute detail of their targets' posts, from cleaning guru Mrs Hinch's perceived struggle to fasten the poppers on her son's outfit (sample quote: 'like she'd never even seen a baby let alone dressed one before') to presenter Stacey Solomon's toenails ('they could snatch salmon out of the river they are that long'). But now, a court has promised that a 'day of reckoning' it coming both for the cogs running the platform as well as those who used it to spit vitriol. For nearly a decade, since the site was set up in 2017, no one knew who ran Tattle Life. But many may be surprised to hear that he is a businessman 'going under a number of aliases' - and is reportedly known online as the author and foodie behind plant-based recipe Instagram page Nest and Glow (boasting 135,000 followers), according to the plaintiffs' legal team. Sebastian's identity can be revealed after the High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland last week granted an application to lift reporting restrictions, The Journal reports. Couple Neil and Donna Sands pursued legal action after facing 'defamation and harassment' on Tattle Life 'threads'. Donna, who runs Sylkie along with other brands, and Neil, an AI founder, said they found a 45-page thread of which they were subject to. This was deleted in May of this year. As per the outlet, Neil first reached out to the site operators in 2021 and asked them to take down the commentary about himself and Donna 'or face legal action'. In 2023, they initiated the process. Neil and Donna got £150,000 each in damages, and the Court granted an injunctive relief to prevent Tattle Life from posting about the couple again. It was also ordered that the Sands' legal costs be paid, with 'further costs and third-party compliance expenses' amounting to £1.8 million. The defendants' cessation figure - the amount which is payable to lift freezing orders against them - is currently at £1,077,173.00. The judge hit out at Tattle Life, stating there was 'clearly a case of peddling untruths for profit'. 'It is the exercise of extreme cynicism - the calculated exercise of extreme cynicism,' they continued. 'Which in reality constitutes behaviour solely aimed at making profit out of people's misery. 'People facilitating this are making money out of it… protecting their income streams by protecting the identity of the individual posters.' It is also understood that Sebastian uses different names online - one of them being Bastian Durward - and owns a number of businesses across the world. Two of them, Mr Justice Colton confirmed, include UK-registered Yuzu Zest Limited and Hong Kong-registered Kumquat Tree Limited. According to Companies House information, the former is currently in liquidation but alleged to offer 'media representation services'. At a hearing last Thursday, the court saw a letter from Sebastian's legal team, sent to one of the plaintiffs, claiming he was the Tattle Life founder but was 'unaware of any legal proceedings against him'. The Sands legal representatives disputed that he was unaware. An initial glimpse at Nest and Glow doesn't won't rouse suspicions that its founder is running a social media platform that has become known for its 'cruel' remarks. Aesthetic photos of mango chia seed pots and sweet potato snacks dominate the feed, along with instructions for recipes. An Amazon author page for his cookbook - being flogged for £20 online - claims that 'Bastian' has a 'passion for sharing healthy recipes to inspire everyone to eat natural food full of nutrients and vitamins' 'I've been vegan for over 30 years and on a nutrient-dense plant-based healthy diet for 15 of those,' he added. 'In 2015 I decided to leave my office job in order to follow my passions. This resulted in setting up the site Nest and Glow where I share healthy recipes and other natural lifestyle content.' However, the Irish couple who unmasked him as Tattle Life, have shared the names of his alises on their social media - stating that he was masking under the false name as a site moderator, Helen McDougal. 'Dear Friends,' Neil and Donna shared in an Instagram statement this weekend. ' As a couple we never wanted or expected to undertake this work, however when we discovered the hate site Tattle.Life we were forced to take action. 'We are very grateful for your support, and hope that this serves as a reminder to those who want to attack others from behind a screen - that the internet is not an anonymous place. 'We will share more soon, but for today, we hope that this news will provide some peace to those affected by online hate and harassment, and that the internet can be a safer space for us all. Onward.' Tattle Life states on its site that it has a 'zero-tolerance policy to any content that is abusive, hateful, harmful and a team of moderators online 24/7 to remove any content that breaks our strict rules - often in minutes'. However, it adds that 'influencer marketing is insidious' and 'revolves around people that occupy the space between celebrity and friend to stealthy sell when in reality it's a parasocial relationship. 'It's an important part of a healthy, free and fair society for members of the public to have an opinion on those in a position of power and influence; that is why tattle exists. 'We allow people to express their views on businesses away from an influencers feed on a site where they would have to go out of their way to read, this is not trolling.' As reported per The Journal, Neil Sands also said: 'We undertook this case not just for ourselves but for the many people who have suffered serious personal and professional harm through anonymous online attacks on this and other websites. 'We believe in free speech, but not consequence-free speech – particularly where it is intended to, and succeeds in, causing real-world damage to people's lives, livelihoods and mental health. We were in the fortunate position to be able to take the fight to these faceless operators, and it took a lot of time, effort and expense.' Countless celebrities have been subject to vitriol at the hands of vicious comment threads - as well as those with smaller online presences. One tribe seems to draw particular malice: so-called mumfluencers, Instagram influencers who make their trade in sharing the exploits of themselves and their children online. In 2023, former mummy blogger Clemmie Hooper was handed a caution order for a period of one-year following a midwifery misconduct hearing - four years after she engaged in trolling other influencers on a gossip forum. The mother-of-four from Kent, once boasted 700,000 followers on Instagram and had partnered with brands such as Mothercare and Boden on sponsored posts. But in 2019, Clemmie - who worked part-time as a midwife - came off social media after her account on Tattle Life, a website devoted to discussing influencers, was exposed. Among the posts made under the Alice in Wanderlust psuedonym, was one accusing Black mummy blogger Candice Brathwaite of social climbing, being 'aggressive' and using her..."

'Gossip' website Tattle Life first appeared on the internet in 2018 as a website for people to 'fairly' criticise celebrities. But seven years and 48,000 threads later, the site has become notorious for people to mock, degrade and dox family members of content creators. Now the man behind Tattle Life has been exposed as plant-based recipe influencer Sebastian Bond, known as Bastian Durward of Nest & Glow. Irish couple Neil and Donna Sands discovered Bond's identity after suing the website for hosting defamatory commentary about them. They argued that the website has 'profited as a space where users could defame, harass, stalk and attack others online'. Donna, who runs the clothing brand Syklie, and tech businessman Neil were awarded £300,000 by the Northern Ireland High Court last week. What is Tattle Life? Tattle Life says it is a commentary website for 'public' social media accounts. Its landing page says: 'We allow commentary and critiques of people that choose to monetise their personal life as a business and release it into the public domain.' Categories for 'public figure gossip' include families, gurus, Instagrammers, bloggers and so-called traditional celebs. SimilarWeb, a web analytics service, says that Tattle Life has received more than 15.5million views in the last month. Who is Sebastian Bond? With reporting restrictions lifted, Bond has been unmasked as the man secrely running Tattle Life. He is 'a former office worker that quit long days in London to move to the countryside and share natural recipes and lifestyle tips', according to his profile on Nest & Glow. Bond is linked to two businesses: Yuzu Zest Limited (a UK-registered company) and Kumquat Tree Limited (registered in Hong Kong). Tattle Life's website says it is run by 'Helen McDougal' of 'Lime Goss'. Awarding damages to the couple in December, Justice McAlinden said Tattle Life was 'clearly a case of peddling untruths for profit'. He said: 'It is the exercise of extreme cynicism – the calculated exercise of extreme cynicism. 'Which in reality constitutes behaviour solely aimed at making profit out of people's misery.

Described as the 'the most hate-filled corner of the web', the site has hit the headlines after its founder was unmasked as plant-based recipe influencer Sebastian Bond, known as Bastian Durward of Nest & Glow. His identity came to light after Neil and Donna Sands, who runs the clothing brand Syklie, sued the website for hosting defamatory commentary about them. They argued that the website has 'profited as a space where users could defame, harass, stalk and attack others online' and were awarded £300,000 by the Northern Ireland High Court last week. Despite many petitions to shut Tattle life down, the site is so popular there is even a waitlist to join. A delve into its pages quickly unearths thousands of vicious threads posted by an army of devoted users. 'What a rough-looking, ugly, greasy bleep. Look at that manky tan line near her greasy hairline,' one commenter, called officially2020, said in a post about a reality star. Another, who goes under the name of teshhco-tart, described a famous cleaning influencer as 'the most low energy, uncreative, ungrateful, lazy, ugly and unhygienic hating witch there is!' . There's also a thread all about how ugly the children of one TV presenter are. Tattle Life rules state a zero-tolerance policy to any content that is abusive, hateful or harmful – but it's clear many users say whatever they want about anyone they want without any fear of accountability. Under the cloak of anonymity that the site offers, some commentators must have felt untouchable. That was, until recently. Lawsuits aside, there's a wave of Instagram accounts seeking to expose the trolls that stalk the site's pages in the same manner over the last few years. One is called Tattlers_Unmasked, a private account with over 38,000 followers, which sporadically reveals the people they say are behind the hurtful comments on Tattle Life. Those being exposed come from all walks of life, from charity workers to retail assistants, and not only are their names and pictures posted, but workplaces are tagged and LinkedIn profiles are screengrabbed. After 'outing' one troll, the account declared: 'I hope now she knows what it feels like to be scrutinised.' Speaking exclusively to Metro, the woman behind Tattle Unmasked says that she decided to reveal the identity of the 'trolls' posting on the site because 'no one else is standing up for the people who have threads'. 'They just have to take it,' explains Michelle, who has asked to go under a pseudonym to protect her own identity. 'Tattlers take it upon themselves to contact brands, contact the press, report influencers to the RSPCA, Social Services and anyone else they can report people to. What gives them the right to do that? Unmasking them is my way of clapping back for the influencers. 'Having spoken to many people who have threads, it is not knowing what their tattlers look like that is the most frightening. They could be anyone. Tattlers_Unmasked gives my followers the chance to see for themselves that tattlers are just normal people, like you and me.' How it all began Initially called Tattle.life, the site first appeared online in 2017 with Helen McDougall named as its originator. ' Helen' is quoted on the forum as saying that the motivation to set up Tattle was due to some influencers 'brazenly breaking the guidelines for adverts' in posts where they were paid to promote brands or products. Yet it's not just a breach of advertising standards that influencers and celebrities are being attacked for. While the site claims to have a team of moderators online 24/7 to remove any content that breaks its strict rules, a search exposes thousands of forums tearing women apart for everything from their looks to their mental health or even their children.

Anyone can be a target… or a troll Vicky Saynor runs the Bethnal & Bec holiday rental company with her husband Chris and found herself facing 10 days of terrifying trolling back in 2020 when they opened up their properties for survivors of domestic abuse to use as safe housing. 'The abuse felt constant,' she tells Metro. ' We worked with local authorities and social services to ensure everything was above board and posted about our decision on Instagram.' Although the couple never identified the women who sought shelter, someone decided to set up a Tattle thread accusing them of offering her refuge to make themselves look good. 'They said we weren't qualified and were putting the women's lives at risk,' remembers Vicky. ' Someone encouraged others to troll our social accounts, and we started to get 20-30 messages a day on Instagram.' Although she was too scared to view the actual thread on Tattle, Vicky asked a friend to keep an eye on it in case things took a nasty turn. 'They knew our address as we lived near our rental properties and people were threatening to turn up,' she remembers. ' There was so much anger, I was terrified. The abuse lasted for about 10 days before it died down, but it felt like forever.

mov_16FDA4F6AB4BD05EDCDBB170FF095306,2025-06-17 10:11:00,en,WEB,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Katie Price has led the celebrities supporting the take down of Tattle Life after the anonymous blogger was unmasked on Monday. British 'business owner' Sebastian Bond, 41, who goes by the alias Bastian Durward, has been confirmed as the secret mastermind behind the online forum with thousands of threads where people comment on influencers, celebrities and anyone with even the smallest public profile. After losing a £300,000 defamation case after he was successfully sued by Donna and Neil Sands, celebrities have rushed to share their support for the couple against the gossip site. Replying to Donna's Instagram announcement post, Katie shared an array of applause emojis before also taking to her Story to raise awareness. Meanwhile psychologist Dr Jessica Taylor took to Instagram on Monday to share that she and Neil Sands were beginning government action against Sebastian and the website itself. And Katie reshared the announcement to her story, which asked the government to begin criminal action against Tattle users. It read: 'Individually, we were victims, but together with the ruling pursued by @neilsands_ and @donnasands_ - we are now unstoppable.' A host of other celebrities also commented on Donna's post as they shared their support after falling victim to the site themselves. Stacey Solomon wrote: 'Thank you. ❤️ for all you've done'. Meanwhile actress Alice Evans commented: 'Hopefully this will encourage more lawyers to take our cases on. 'Maybe we can make up some of the income we lost through their lies.' Influencer Sophie Hinchliffe, who is best known by her online brand Mrs Hinch, penned: 'Oh my gosh I pray this is true. 'The website that has damaged my mental health and harassed me and my family beyond words for over 6 years. 'They've stalked me, lied about me, mocked me and my beautiful children. Accused me of the unthinkable, brainwashed my supporters. Sickening behaviour that I've silently had to put up with every single day. 'My thread (as I'm sure you've seen) is one of the largest on there , with hourly abuse. I hope to god this site gets taken down. Thank you for all you've done'. Big Brother star Henry Southan added: 'Great news' while Love Island's Tasha Ghouri posted applause emojis. Fellow Love Island stars Kady McDermott and Siannise Fudge wrote: 'Thank you so much'. Ashley James added: 'Amazing!!!' and Sharon Gafka penned: 'Thank you'. Lauryn Goodman commented: 'Well done guys! Amazing work now time for the data … who's been behind those accounts! Thank you so much for taking this on . . it was huge!' After Donna and Neil appeared on Good Morning Britain on Tuesday, Lauryn also reposted the video as she commented: 'Can still see the pain @donnasands_ has had to endure, Well done guys @neilsands_'. Responding to Sebastian's comment that he 'strongly denies ruining anyone's life', Lauryn penned: 'I'm sorry the audacity.... SEBASTIAN you have denied it???? DENIED it? 'You had SO much time to respond you ignored and still do. You're actually in contempt of court. Honestly if you don't laugh you'll cry... just call him shaggy from now on ""it wasn't me."" Even with the piles of evidence.' Thanking Donna and Neil for their work she added: 'We can't thank you both enough and the fight continues. . you kept going even though it took a lot of resources! Warriors'. Tattle's site attracts 12 million visitors a month, and is supposedly aimed at exposing disingenuous influencers who make money from social media. But it rapidly descended into a paradise for trolls to aim abuse at everyone including Mrs Hinch and Stacey Solomon to mummy bloggers with small followings. Last week restrictions on identifying Sebastian were lifted after Neil and Donna were awarded £300,000 at the High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland in 2023 after successfully suing Bond for 'defamation and harassment' in posts aimed at them on the site. For nearly a decade, since the site was set up in 2017, no one knew who ran Tattle Life, with the site's operator going under the fake name Helen McDougal. Many will be now surprised to learn the creator is in fact a man, who is the author and foodie behind plant-based recipe Instagram page Nest and Glow, which boasts 135,000 followers. For the past eight years, the vegan cookbook author he has secretly presided over the site, which makes an estimated £276,770 in Google Ad revenue every six months, according to figures from 2021. Meanwhile, influencers, their partners and even their children, have been on the receiving end of abuse and mockery over their weight and disabilities - while private details such as their home addresses have been shared on the forum."
20e38e4d5b8dab6f77f091e4e3da15c5,2025-06-17 13:45:00,en,WEB,"  Not every great night needs reservations or a fancy dress-code. Sometimes, the most memorable evenings happen right at home, where the vibe is relaxed and the company is just right. Whether you're gathering with a few close friends or planning a more elaborate evening, combining good food, great laughs, and something to keep everyone entertained can turn an ordinary night into something special. Here's how to create the perfect mix of comfort, connection, and a touch of excitement, all without stepping outside your door. Start with a Simple, Shareable Menu The heart of any gathering is the food. Skip complicated dishes and go for shareable comfort food that encourages people to gather around the table. Think flatbreads, charcuterie boards, or a taco bar where everyone can build their own plate. Add a few crowd-pleasers like oven-baked nachos or sliders to keep things casual and fun. If your group enjoys cooking together, you could even make it a joint activity by preparing homemade pizzas or dumplings. When the kitchen becomes part of the fun, it adds a cozy, hands-on layer to the evening. Add a Twist with Live Entertainment Once the plates are cleared, keep the energy going with something more engaging than the usual movie night. Live entertainment doesn't mean hiring performers. There are plenty of creative ways to bring it home. Consider hosting a live music stream, a comedy special, or an interactive quiz night. You might even take things up a notch with something unexpected. For example, some groups enjoy trying out real-time gaming platforms like Live Casino in Ontario at JackpotCity , which adds a splash of excitement and unpredictability to the night without anyone needing to leave the couch. Just remember to keep it light and social. Create the Right Atmosphere The tone of the night is often set by the environment, so put a little thought into the setup. Dim the lights, light a few candles , or string up fairy lights for a soft, warm glow. Music can help ease people into a relaxed mindset. Build a playlist that evolves with the evening, from mellow background tunes during dinner to more upbeat tracks as the night unfolds. Set out extra pillows, blankets, or even floor cushions to make the space feel relaxed and inviting. A comfortable setting encourages people to stay longer and settle in fully. Keep the Conversation Flowing Even the best snacks and entertainment fall flat if conversation stalls. Games like Would You Rather? or card games with a twist can prompt laughs and stories. If you have a mix of personalities in the room, it helps to guide things without being too formal. Ask everyone to bring a story, song, or photo to share, something that sparks connection or nostalgia. With friends, there's usually no shortage of things to talk about, but a few intentional moments of reflection or humor can deepen the experience. The goal is connection, not just chatter. Don't Overplan…Leave Room for Spontaneity One of the best things about a night in is that there's no timeline or pressure to keep things rigid. Give your evening a gentle structure, but leave space for spontaneous fun. Maybe someone wants to try a new cocktail recipe, or a late-night singalong breaks out unexpectedly. Be open to letting the evening unfold naturally. Sometimes the unplanned bits end up being the highlight. And when your guests leave feeling full, relaxed, and genuinely happy, you'll know you've found the right mix of food, friends, and a little bit of fun."

Everyone's talking about the “holy grails,” viral faves, and the latest-and-greatest… but what about the quiet achievers in your routine? You know - the ones your skin loves and actually get the job done? ✅ glowrecipe is known for fun, fruity, and effective skincare — but some of their gems deserve way more love. Today, I'm spotlighting a few underrated faves that seriously shine, especially for summer! WATERMELON GLOW ULTRA-FINE MIST I fight for this product day and night, mainly because I'm lowkey afraid it'll get discontinued. I pack it for every trip because it works triple-duty as an essence, hydrator, and setting spray. Honestly, if they ever brought the price point down to under $25, I really believe it would fly off the shelves—and stay in the lineup where it belongs! GUAVA VITAMIN C DARK SPOT SERUM One of the first products I added to my boyfriend's skincare routine when I was building it. He struggled with dark spots, discoloration, and uneven tone. After just 30 days of consistent use? His skin was clear as day. WATERMELON GLOW AHA NIGHT TREATMENT BUT… it's literally glass skin in a bottle. If you want that smooth, radiant glow and don't mind a little extra cleanup, this could be your new fave night magic. WATERMELON GLOW HYALURONIC CLAY PORE-TIGHT FACIAL RIP to this gem—now officially discontinued. I loved double masking with this, especially in summer: starting with this gentle clay mask that's surprisingly non-drying (even for my dry skin!) and packed with hydration and nutrients. The perfect way to refresh and tighten pores—without that tight, flaky feeling. #officialglowgangambassador #GlowRecipe #crueltyfree *PR/GIFTED but all opinions are mine ♀️ “What's your most underrated skincare product that deserves its moment?” Let me know in the comment! #beautybanchanwithchristykim #summerskincare #glowrecipewatermelon #glowrecipeskincare #summerskin #summerskintips #summerskinhacks #sephoraskincare Glow recipe skincare, glow recipe watermelon, Sephora skincare, clean skincare"

mov_D10B5A1A159495FD43CF2EAAB61254F7,2025-06-18 10:05:05,en,WEB,"  A victim of vile abuse on gossip site Tattle Life has opened up on a bullying experience which left her 'sick to the core' after trolls went after her daughter, her husband and even found out where she lived. Online health influencer Dani Kumrou first ventured onto the online forum in 2022 despite her best friend's very firm warning: 'Don't look at it.' By logging on, she joined 12 million monthly visitors on a site initially created to expose disingenuous social media stars, but which rapidly descended into a sea of hatred aimed at everyone from Stacey Solomon to 'mummy bloggers' with small followings. She instantly regretted it, as she was bombarded by thousands of pre-existing nasty messages, before the 'personal attack' accelerated when her abusers realised she was reading their words. After a miserable ordeal spanning three years, the social media personality is finally ready to spill Tattle's secrets, following the unmasking of the page's British 'business owner' Sebastian Bond, who goes by the alias Bastian Durward, this week. Ms Kumrou told MailOnline: 'All I did was Google ""Tattle Life"" and my name and then I saw all this stuff come up. 'It made me feel sick to the core. I'd never read anything like it in my life. I couldn't believe it. It really shook me up. 'Most of the stuff was about my appearance. They would say I was fat and ugly, and talk about the way I speak, the way I dress, it really was a personal attack.' A self-described 'confident person', the influencer weathered this initial spate of nastiness. But when trolls brought her family into their campaign of hatred, Ms Kumrou was left reeling. 'I then read stuff about my daughter, who is now 14. My husband was also ridiculed on there. 'It's almost like obsession. I would look at it every day, and it did really affect me. I'm a very confident person. I don't really get knocked by things like that, but when it's that personal and it's about you every day you start to question, ""is what I'm doing right? Do I even want to work online anymore?"" 'I was determined not to let these people take me off of the internet. When it was about me, a lot of it was nonsense, but when they start talking about your family and your children, it gets a little bit more personal.' Amid this nightmare period of online abuse and vitriole, Ms Kumrou was occupied with one question: 'Why her?' An influencer working for a health company with a healthy, but fairly modest, follower count in the tens of thousands, she wasn't exactly a traditional target for a pitchfork-wielding mob. 'I do share bits of my life online but I'm not a celebrity,' she said. ' So I couldn't understand why they were so fascinated with me. 'I didn't understand at first, the concept of anonymous posting and the fake profile. 'A lot of the people writing about me actually had me as their profile picture. But they would screenshot a picture, if I was on a live stream or something that looked really unattractive, that made me look like I had 10 chins. 'Then they would have these made up names, so I couldn't work out who they were, why they had my profile picture, and then I looked into it and realised, these were anonymous people posting about people and tearing them apart.' With wave after wave of nasty remarks being plastered across the site for all to see, Ms Kumrou took comfort from the fact that she still maintained a modicum of privacy. But the mob soon took a torch to this too, finding out where she lived and where she was moving to. 'They put up my address. Even though I share my life online, I've always been quite careful with not tagging myself in exact locations. When I'm at home, I tag myself in a different city because I'm aware that I work online and you have to be careful. 'And they've always been obsessed with where I live. Then, when we put our house for sale, they found it on Rightmove, and publicly posted the Rightmove with my address on there. 'That's when I thought, ""You know what? Enough is enough."" That's when it really upset me, because it is scary. Why do they want to know where I live? 'Then I did a public post on my social media saying I wouldn't be sharing my moving journey. 'We found a property that we thought that we were going to move into, and all I did online was send a picture from the balcony. 'There was no picture of the house online but somehow they found it and this is how your brain starts thinking, ""Oh, it must be someone I know. It must be someone that I've told about this house that I'm looking at."" 'You start to suspect everyone so it really does affect your relationships and your friendships, because you don't know who you can and can't trust. 'I've blocked so many people off my social media who are probably innocent. It really does damage your mental health.' Last week, restrictions on identifying Bond were lifted, two years after Neil and Donna Sands were awarded £300,000 at the High Court of Justice in Northern Ireland after successfully suing him for 'defamation and harassment' in posts on the site...."

The site describes itself as a platform for “commentary and critiques of people that choose to monetise their personal life as a business and release it into the public domain” Like many social media platforms, Tattle Life allows users to post discussion threads, but these often took a nasty turn, resulting in toxic and hurtful conversations which targeted a selection of celebrities and influencers, from TikTok star GK Barry to TV host Stacey Solomon. Despite its nature, the site accumulated 12 million readers per month. 'I thought someone was going to kill me and my unborn baby' Since the site opened in 2018, Tattle Life has had a notorious reputation for going a step too far. Victims of the site have reported that their partners and children were all 'fair game' to Tattle Life's trolling, which often targeted people's weight and disabilities. Tattle Life trolls even went as far as exposing the GDPR details such as the addresses of their family homes, reports MailOnline. A female creator feared for her life and her pregnancy after her home address was shared on the website. The anonymous mother told Cosmopolitan: ""I had such paranoia that someone was going to break in and kill me, and my unborn baby, that I was signed off work for a week"". A site 'making profit out of people's misery' Now, after years of celebrity complaints against the site, a couple has finally won their libel case against Tattle Life. Neil Sands, 43, and his wife Donna, 34, sued over posts made in February 2021. They claimed they were subject to a campaign of harassment, invasion of privacy, defamation and breach of data rights. Article continues below The legal battle lasted two years and was undertaken at the cost of Mr and Mrs Sands. The plaintiffs were originally awarded £300,000 in damages against the then unknown operators of Tattle Life in late 2023. On June 13, the defendant companies and suspected operator of the site, Sebastian Bond, was revealed after reporting restrictions were lifted at Belfast's High Court. Ruling in their favour, Belfast's High Court judge said the website was “solely aimed at making profit out of people's misery”, according to The Guardian. The court case was funded by the Sands and included a list of freezing orders made that were worth more than £1 million as a global forensic investigation operated to identify both the defendants and their assets. The cessation figure the defendant has to pay was revealed to be a huge sum of £1,077,173 to have the frozen assets order lifted. Help us improve our content by completing the survey below. We'd love to hear from you! Who is Sebastian Bond? At Belfast's High Court in 2023, it was revealed that Sebastian Bond, a 41-year-old Brit, was the man behind the gossip forum. He also goes under the alias of Bastian Durwud. Bond was unveiled as a vegan influencer and the author behind the plant-based recipe Instagram account Nest and Glow, which has 135,000 followers. MailOnline reports that Tattle Life's six-month revenue is estimated at £276,770 in Google Ads, according to figures from 2021. 'The internet is not an anonymous place' Mr Sands has said that the case had been done for all those who had suffered severe professional and personal distress from the anonymous virtual attacks. Though the thread about Neil and Donna was successfully removed in May 2025, thousands of others persist online. The couple posted a statement on Instagram, writing: ""'We are very grateful for your support, and hope that this serves as a reminder to those who want to attack others from behind a screen - that the internet is not an anonymous place. We will share more soon, but for today, we hope that this news will provide some peace to those affected by online hate and harassment, and that the internet can be a safer space for us all. Onward"". Article continues below Tattle Life remains live and running, with the next case review scheduled for June 26 at Belfast's High Court."

myxwj58,2025-06-21 05:26:10,en,REDDIT,"  I found that frustrating, myself. I was always tweaking it and never just reading because I kept wanting to refresh the screen and then would get confused by the various settings and it didn't simply ”just work” the way the Kindle does for me. I'm not saying that's the perfect solution however 90% of the books I read I get from the library and the integration is super easy on the Kindle in my book, so to speak. Ouch. Bad pun. I do why a handful of self-help, Buddhist, and reference types of books. Probably because I started downloading apps and what not on it so I can make it easier to share from the Kindle app, wound up finding me too distracted with the device. So I'm back to the Kindle basic and gave my paperwhite to a friend as a gift. I like the size of the Kindle basic and the improved contrast in the latest model it actually looks sharper than the paperwhite because the screen is jammed down, though some prefer the paperwhite's larger screen. I wish the basic Kindle had a flush display, and the nice nighttime golden glow feature. Because for me the size is perfect for slipping in my pocket. Even a front pocket. I love the idea of the Paula too so much I bought it twice and kept trying to make it work for me and I have a tech background and I'm not shy with messing around with settings and what not, still, it just wouldn't go from page to page and consistently look nice and I found myself compulsively Refreshing the screen over and over. I loved that I could change pages with buttons the way you can with the Kindle app on certain devices like Kindle fires and android devices but not with the iPhone which sucks. If anyone has a magic recipe/solution on how to make the polar to just work without having to think about fiddling with the E ink screen so much, and the refresh, I would be so grateful. PS pardon all the typos I used dictation because I have painful neuropathy at night. Oh yeah: I do like how the paperwhite has that feature of double tapping the back of the device and it flips the page to the left. That's very cool I wish the basic had that same feature as well. I can do that with my iPhone too and that's really cool"

mov_78BE614165090D3B780FE56AA7DA9E84,2025-06-22 05:43:02,en,WEB,"  Kitchenware Le Creuset celebrates 100 years In a sun-dappled kitchen in Provence, a vibrant orange cooking pot bubbles gently on the stove, exuding the comforting aroma of a boeuf bourguignon. It is a familiar scene in countless homes around the world – a testament to the enduring legacy of Le Creuset, the iconic cookware brand that, this year, quietly turns 100. While its cocotte is almost universally embraced as the epitome of French culinary flair, few realise that Le Creuset's roots trace back to Belgium – a humble origin story that, like a family recipe, has long simmered just beneath the surface. And, as we'll see, it has a very Belgian coda wrapped in a spectacular Art Nouveau design. Its story begins with the 1924 meeting of two Belgian businessmen: Armand Desaegher, a specialist in casting from Oudenaarde, and Octave Aubecq, an industrialist from Gosselies. Desaegher brought his foundry expertise, while Aubecq brought knowledge of enamel glazing, as the head of the Émailleries et Tôleries Réunies company. Their encounter at the Brussels Trade Fair that year is not as storied as, say, when Charles Rolls and Sir Henry Royce met at the Midland Hotel in Manchester, but it led to a much more egalitarian industrial icon. Together, they combined their know-how to revolutionise cookware by casting iron pots and coating them in colourful enamel — a novel idea at the time. Desaegher and Aubecq's venture would, however, be founded across the border, in Fresnoy le Grand a small town in northern France: Picardy was seen as the crossroads of transportation routes for iron, coke and sand. They set up shop in 1925 in a disused foundry near the railway line – ideal for transporting the raw materials and finished goods. They were far from the first to make pots in cast iron – it had been used since Roman times and prized for spreading the heat so food is cooked evenly. But traditional cast iron is high maintenance: its inner surface needs regular seasoning so that food doesn't stick. Their innovation was the vitreous enamel coating that gave it a smooth cooking surface which was easy to clean and maintain. Desaegher's precision in casting iron gave Le Creuset its technical backbone, while Aubecq's enamelling mastery ensured every piece gleamed with a jewelled finish. The resulting cocotte was more than cookware – it was a promise of durability, beauty and gastronomic excellence. The enamel also offered opportunities for pigmentation. Their first cocotte was coloured after the intense orange glow of molten cast iron inside a cauldron – a creuset in French means crucible or melting pot. Hence Le Creuset's signature fiery colour, Volcanique – or Flame, for English-speaking markets. Heirlooms and Instagram It was launched at an auspicious moment. After the First World War, Europe was rebuilding, and kitchens were largely utilitarian. But Le Creuset's cocotte was not just a pot. It was a symbol of culinary possibility. Over the decades, Le Creuset became synonymous with timeless design and French savoir-faire. Its colourful palette – now boasting over a hundred hues globally – elevated it to cult status. Celebrity chefs adored it. Julia Child cooked with Le Creuset on her trailblazing American TV show in the 1960s, effectively launching the brand into the hearts and homes of millions. Marilyn Monroe owned a 12-piece set in Elysée yellow, while Queen Elizabeth was said to be a fan. Today, Le Creuset is still manufactured in Fresnoy-le-Grand, where molten iron is poured into individual sand moulds, then hand-finished and inspected at least 15 times before leaving the factory. This meticulous process – a century old and still going strong – underscores a rare commitment to craftsmanship in an era of mass production. Yet Le Creuset's staying power is about more than nostalgia. It has evolved with the times, expanding its offerings to include stainless steel, non-stick pans and silicone tools. It has 60 colours in its range: this year's palette includes berry and teal. The cocotte, still the flagship piece, remains relevant not only in professional kitchens but also on the Instagram feeds of a new generation of home cooks. In Belgium, generations of cooks have reached for their trusted cocottes to coax depth and flavour for dishes like carbonade flamande and waterzooi. Le Creuset pieces handed down from one generation to the next can sometimes outlast the stoves they were first cooked on. “Our best ambassadors are our customers, who might remember it from, say, their grandmas,” says Marie Gigot Managing Director Le Creuset France and Benelux. “They have family histories, family memories, with our products, and they share that a lot. There's the emotional link that you have: if you're offering that to your granddaughter, it is something she will probably keep for a lifetime. We are something you can trust, something that will last for a lifetime. We are a lifestyle brand. We have a lot more to tell than only cast iron.” Lost Art Nouveau masterpiece As for Aubecq, he briefly left his mark on Brussels. He was 60 when he first met Desaegher and had already made a fortune decades earlier with his enamel company. He was rich enough by the turn of the century to commission a house in Brussels, custom-built by the most celebrated architect of the era, Art Nouveau pioneer Victor Horta. The result was the spectacular Hôtel Aubecq, built between 1899 and 1902, at 520 Ave Louise, next to the Bois de la Cambre. The mansion was notable for its three-sided façades and octagonal rooms, with several arches and balconies made of imaginative ironwork and stones from Modave — an example of Horta's Gesamtkunstwerk approach, where architecture, interior design, and furniture are seamlessly integrated. Aubecq died in 1943, aged 79...."

Me."" </strong> </blockquote> <hr /> <h1>💌 <em>“Dear Me… From Me”</em></h1> <h3>🪷 <em>A Heartfelt Letter to the Soul I Often Forget</em></h3> <em>(A Soul-Spoken Blog by Sanghavi Jayesh – Beyond Horizon)</em> <hr /> <h2>🌟 <strong>Introduction – When 'You' Is Also 'Me'</strong></h2> Have you ever paused in the middle of chaos and heard… your own heart whisper? A tiny voice, beneath the rush of responsibilities, saying: <em>""Are you listening to me? I miss you."" </em> Today's blog is <em>not written to the world. </em> It's written <em>to the self within</em>. Because sometimes, the person we most ignore… is <strong>ourselves</strong>. And so, in the quiet of a morning, a letter arrived — not by post, but by <strong>pause</strong>. And the sender… was <em>Me</em>. <hr /> <h2>💎 <strong>Main Content – 9 Reflections From 'Me to Me'</strong></h2> <hr /> <h3>💠 1. <strong>“Dear Me, When Did You Last Hug Yourself?” </strong></h3> You keep hugging others — friends, kids, society — But <strong>when did your arms circle around your own shoulders? </strong> When was the last time you said — ""I'm proud of you""? <em>Example:</em> Just yesterday, you encouraged a friend in pain. But when you cried in silence… no one saw — not even <strong>you</strong>. <hr /> <h3>💠 2. <strong>“Why Do You Keep Apologizing For Feeling?” </strong></h3> You felt overwhelmed… then said sorry. You cried… then hid your tears. But emotions are <em>not mistakes</em> — they're <em>messages</em>. <em>Example:</em> You stopped yourself from breaking down at a temple… But God never said, “Please cry outside.” <em>He said: cry here, where I stay. </em> <hr /> <h3>💠 3. <strong>“Please Stop Believing That You're Behind”⏳</strong></h3> You always think someone else is ahead — In career, family, parenting, purpose...."

DD4F2E7E29FF534A59360F96DDA76A6A,2025-06-24 07:20:06,en,PRINT,"  A couple of weeks ago, when Hamzah Nasser learned that the Israeli military had bombed the Yemeni port of Hudaydah, he knew he had a problem. His monthly coffee shipments already involved an arduous journey from the country's mountainous interior to his cafe in Dearborn, Mich. -- facing warring factions on land and rebel fire by sea. Now their usual path was blocked. ''It's getting a little bit stressful,'' Nasser said. A Yemeni cafe requires Yemeni coffee. And Nasser, who plans to open many more Yemeni cafes, needs a lot more beans. Nasser, a former truck driver, opened his first Haraz Coffee House in Dearborn four years ago. Since then, he has gone from hauling parts for the likes of Ford to buying a 70,000-square-foot building in Dearborn that housed the company's vehicle prototypes. His headquarters now holds two industrial roasters and a bakery, where a pastry chef recently arrived from France to train his staff. In an office upstairs, his franchising team crunches the numbers on where Haraz should open next. Increasingly, the answer is: everywhere. Nasser, who intends to double his locations to 60 in the next six months, originally sought to open cafes in Arab neighborhoods or near mosques. But his search has expanded to anywhere that's young and diverse, or where families will linger late into the night and buy multiple rounds of $7.95 pistachio lattes. Chances are, the coffeehouses will wind up just a short distance from another Yemeni cafe. Coffee shops owned by Yemeni Americans are a mainstay in immigrant communities like Dearborn, the Arab American-majority suburb of Detroit where Nasser moved from Yemen in the early 1990s at age 6. The country is one of the original homes of coffee culture, with centuries-old recipes and brewing methods, and its earthy beans are prized. For Nasser, entering immigrant-run cafes where card-playing old men would linger for hours, shouting orders through plumes of smoke, was like visiting home. But he and other entrepreneurs have discovered a much broader appeal, riding a wave of demand nationwide for ''third spaces'' -- gathering places outside of the home and work -- that are open late and don't involve alcohol. Yemeni cafes are helping bring back an evening cafe culture not seen much in the United States since the ''Friends'' era. The look has been updated. At Haraz, the glossy aesthetics of a V.I.P. airport lounge meet the energy of a student union during finals week -- a place where you can work, gossip or flirt under Instagram-friendly light, late into the night. ''There's a clear gap in the market,'' said Bahaa Kaddoura, a franchising consultant who has helped Nasser strategize his rapid expansion. '' People just need a nice place to hang out.'' Along with other chains like Qamaria Coffee and Qahwah House, Haraz is seizing the moment through franchising. All three were founded within miles of one another in suburban Michigan. And along with late hours -- generally 11 p.m. or later -- they share menu staples, like cardamom-spiced chais and pistachio lattes. (The brands are propelled by TikTok reviewers happy to parse subtle differences in flavors and vibes.) The reviewers also share complaints, about pricey lattes and long waits for chai during the Friday evening rush. Nasser has had little trouble courting franchisees willing to spend up to $500,000 to open new locations (including a $50,000 franchise fee), whether single proprietors or larger-scale investors who would normally open a Chick-fil-A or a Buffalo Wild Wings. Fellow Yemenis make up a small percentage of the new owners. '' I'm working with a guy named Cody in Colorado,'' Nasser said. '' Can you believe that?'' Dan Tepman, a commercial real estate investor, recently signed his first lease with a Yemeni cafe in Northern California and is in discussions for several more. He first heard about Yemeni coffee through reports of packed strip mall parking lots that were once evening dead zones. '' I've never seen such a sudden burst of interest in a retail concept in my career,'' he said. If there's a ceiling to the trend, he added, he isn't seeing it yet. But only a handful of brands will ultimately survive. Nasser said he doesn't mind the competition (though he regrets not patenting his pistachio latte recipe). His dreams include adding hundreds more in the next few years. To expand abroad. To put Haraz on a stock exchange, just like Starbucks. He previously had other dreams. He started trucking after growing weary of running a gas station in East Detroit in his 20s. The money was good -- enough so that he bought three more semis and hired drivers -- and he started a side hustle importing Yemeni coffee through family connections. When Nasser and his wife decided it was time for him to stop driving, opening a cafe was logical. On the road, he would often stop at Starbucks and other chains, mostly to escape the isolation of the cab. But he observed that they emphasized in-and-out efficiency over coziness. His own cafe would be a place to relax and socialize, he decided, like the old cafes he grew up with, but updated with a modern look he'd seen visiting family in Dubai. '' We wanted to bring that clean atmosphere,'' Nasser said. '' It says, 'You're safe here.'''..."

Get ahead of the curve and shop some of our favorite picks on Amazon before they're gone for good. SHEGLAM Color Bloom Liquid Blush in Shade On Point $6.99  $7.99  13% off    Buy Now On Amazon A bright pink liquid blush with a sponge applicator. Blendable and oh-so-pigmented, SHEGLAM's Color Bloom liquid blush is popular for a reason. Retailing for $6.99, the liquid flush comes in a matte finish with a medium but buildable coverage. It all happens thanks to the liquid blush's applicator, a wide doe foot saturated with product that you can dot onto your skin. Once applied, you can tap the blush out with your fingers or buff in with a fluffy brush for an airbrushed look. Color Bloom comes in a multitude of shades that work for all skin tones, but On Point is our fave. The muted rose petal-esque pink has neutral undertones that universally work to bring a wash of color to your cheeks. For a sunkissed look, we recommend dotting this blush on the cheekbones, chin and the bride of the nose. Kosas Revealer Concealer in Tone 10.5 N $6.50  $7.95  18% off    Buy Now On Amazon A fluid concealer with a doe foot applicator. If you're like me, your under eyes could use some help. Dark shadows under the eyes are a major concern for a lot of sleep-deprived folks. Unfortunately, they can also be a product of genetics. Whatever the case may be, you have nothing to fear — Kosas Revealer Concealer is here to save the day. Retailing for $6.50, this concealer is buildable and hydrating, brightening the under eyes seamlessly while leaving a skin-like finish. No caking here.

Kitsch Stainless Steel Gua Sha Facial Tool $9.58  $11.99  20% off    Buy Now On Amazon A stainless steel facial tool to de-puff. It's time to embrace the natural face you were given, enhancing your looks with natural tips and tricks. A good way to help reduce puffiness is with a gua sha tool. You know it works because gua sha — a healing therapy — has been used in beauty routines in China going back thousands of years. The scraping tool — which can be made of various hard materials such as stone and jade — has since been adapted to provide different benefits. Kitsch's gua sha tool is made of stainless steel, a material that works to cool and help depuff the skin. Stainless steel is also non-porous, meaning it won't harbor bacteria or moisture like would. This also means your products will absorb better. In general, gua sha tools are used to massage the body in tandem with an oil or moisturizer, promoting blood circulation and lymphatic drainage. Lymphatic drainage is just a fancy way of saying you're moving extra fluid from a swollen area into an area where the lymph nodes will work to drain said fluid. Tocobo Cotton Airy Sun Stick SPF 50 $17  $20  15% off    Buy Now On Amazon A stick sunscreen with SPF 50. It's heatwave season, which means protecting your skin, especially while on the go, can be a challenge. Tocobo Cotton Airy Sun Stick makes sunscreen application simple. No messy cream or spray, just swipe on and go. The SPF 50 formula is contained in a roll-up stick that glides on, leaving the skin with a matte finish sans the nasty white cast. A sunblock that reads “Broad-spectrum” simply means it protects the skin from both UVA and UVB rays. These pesky rays can cause skin cancer and premature aging if the skin is left unprotected...."

1lmh3n2,2025-06-28 07:38:51,en,REDDIT,"  Chapter 9: Studying one's skill After his kill, Roland waited for Health to do its miracle. Broken bones snapped back into place with audible *cracks*, torn flesh sprang to life, wriggling, connecting, mending. The itching, gods the itching, was too damned much when healing bones. Single sun still hung in the sky, unmoving, making it impossible to tell how much time had passed since he got here. Once he was back in top shape, with resources topped off, Roland roamed the forest in search of more prey. With spear in hand, it was simplicity itself to kill lonesome goblins. Roland couldn't pierce through their skull or ribs before. But two more points in Strength and an ambush from above did the trick wonderfully. Jumped from a tree branch above with Evanescence activated. Skewered brains like festival meat. Simple and effective. Four more fell before he netted himself this makeshift camp. Rudimentary, this camp taken from a Goblin Scout was. Only a ring of soot-stained rocks for a campfire and a hovel of a hut made from thin branches and green leaves. From what he had seen, killing only Goblin Scouts didn't seem to do much for him in terms of gaining experience points. Only one-tenth of his first kill. His bonus experience suffered the same way. Lacking in level for himself as it was, the level of his skills made up for it. Mapping to level sixteen, Predator's Intuition to level fifteen, and some weapons too. Spears and a bow. Coins too, fourteen, making his wealth a total of seventeen. Just from five kills. Not bad at all. Putting his gains aside, Roland spent most of his time in camp, training. ***Ding! Weapon Mastery has reached Level 14. ** Beads of sweat rolled down his bare torso as Roland thrust toward an imagined assassin. In his mind, the assassin's head burst open as if Roland had a thousand points in Strength while his enemy only had a mere ten points in Endurance. Wiping his drenched face, he checked his skill. **Weapon Mastery – Level 14** **Passive** **War. Death. Destruction. The art of killing has been passed down from generation to generation. From sinners to saints, the art of combat remains the same. Without mastery over one's weapons, no enemy can be slain, and no comrade can be protected. To enforce your will, a weapon master you must be. ** **Enhances the user's mastery over all forms of weaponry. ** **Each level moderately increases the user's proficiency with weapons. Scales with Focus. ** **Each level slightly increases the user's power, speed, and control over weapons.

1loh98l,2025-06-30 19:47:28,en,REDDIT,"  Hi everyone! Feeling at my wits end with my skin and needing some help. Ever since starting birth control ~9 years ago, I've felt like my skin has always had…a problem. Long story short, it's never been perfect but BC pill > cystic acne/horrible breakouts > IUD > bit better but consistently 1-2 bad blemishes at all times. I've tried lots of different products and routines over the year. Highly involved, extremely simple, OTC, RX, cheap, expensive. Estheticians and derms can't seem to figure it out. Detail of issue I feel like I have both clogged pores and sensitive skin. Throughout the day so many whiteheads will come up or I'll feel tiny blemishes forming, usually around my chin and cheeks. If a blemish does come up, it sticks around forever/leaves a mark, even if I don't touch it. It does seem to be worse around my period. But I also feel like my cheeks are just “ruddy.” I'm 33 and vegetarian, not vegan, but not a lot of dairy in my diet. My current routine AM Splash water Jojoba oil Elta MD SPF PM Gentle face wash (either cerave or youth to the people super food) Jojoba oil Glow Recipe Avocado Sleeping Mask Occasionally The Ordinary Azalec Acid 2% Chemical exfoliating mask Things I've tried Tret Paula's choice BHA toner Good genes P50 I had a series of laser treatments to try and break up the cheek scarring and it didn't seem to do much My derm recommended Spiro but I was too nervous to try I'm just so frustrated and tired of seeing myself in the mirror or pictures and always feeling like my skin is just a textured, red, uneven mess. Any help is greatly appreciated <3"
mov_29A31AFE95AB124736A26311512EFAF6,2025-06-30 21:15:00,en,WEB,"  There's something magical about the glow of a rotisserie chicken rotating slowly in a grocery store deli case. That golden crispy skin, the glistening juices, the savory aroma wafting through the air—it's enough to make anyone abandon their dinner plans and grab a pre-cooked bird instead. And in the world of grocery shortcuts, rotisserie chicken is a true MVP. It makes meal-planning a snap: shred it for salads or tacos, stir it into a casserole, tuck it into a pita, or, my personal favorite, eat it straight from the container over the sink (or, uh, in the driver's seat of the car). It's a weeknight staple with serious potential and it has countless devoted fans. But let's be honest—not all grocery store birds are the same. Some are juicy and flavorful, while others are sad and dry and taste like they've been spinning since last week. To help you on your next grocery run, I tried six different birds to find the best store-bought rotisserie chicken. And when I tell you the winner was a complete and total shock, I'm not kidding.

What to Look for When Shopping for Rotisserie Chicken The rotisserie chicken contenders When choosing a rotisserie chicken, don't be fooled by golden skin alone. Look for birds that feel heavy for their size (a good sign they're juicy), and check the label for ingredients—fewer usually means less processed. Avoid chickens sitting in pools of liquid or with overly shriveled skin, which can signal dryness. If you're planning to eat it as-is, seasoning matters, but if it's destined for enchiladas or soup, a milder bird might be a better base. Related: Ina Garten Delivers the Roast Chicken of Your Dreams in This Super Simple Recipe Parade How I Tasted These Rotisserie Chickens Rotisserie chickens ready for testing To find out which rotisserie chicken is actually worth bringing home, I picked up six chickens from major grocery chains around Chicago: Walmart, Jewel, Mariano's, Whole Foods, The Fresh Market and Costco. I gathered my team of trusty taste testers—fellow food lovers, rotisserie chicken eaters and all-around excellent people—and brought them together for an evening of complete chicken carnage to find the best of the bunch. Each chicken was bought the day of testing, refrigerated and gently reheated for about 30 minutes at 325° to simulate what you'd do if you brought one home and popped it into the oven. I then labeled each bird with a number to keep the brand identities hidden and sliced them up to expose the white meat, dark meat and skin. Testers were invited to try whatever part they preferred and encouraged to sample across the board for a full picture of each chicken's flavor and texture. Comments and rankings were gathered using a Google Form before I revealed which bird was which and compiled the results. Related: 28 Easy One-Pan Dinners You'll Make Again & Again (& Again) 6 Store-Bought Rotisserie Chickens, Ranked Worst to Best 6. Jewel Signature Select Roasted Chicken With the longest ingredient list of all six birds, Jewel's was a cautionary tale that more doesn't exactly mean better. This chicken ingredient list was a mile long—brown sugar, smoke flavor, soybean oil, garlic powder, xanthan gum and, of course, chicken. None of these ingredients seemed to help it avoid being dubbed the driest, most flavorless of the bunch. Maddie said it was “oddly dry but moist when you eat it,” and needed much more seasoning. Jennifer initially liked the crispy skin but said the meat dried out quickly. Dara found it “slightly salty,” but the texture fell apart in an unappealing way. Samantha said the white meat was “dry and flavorless.” And me? I found it completely lacking in personality and thought it was the worst tasting of the bunch. For all its additives, this one delivered the least. Weight: 30 ounces Price: $7 5. Mariano's Deli Fresh Rotisserie Chicken Mariano's chicken also had a fairly lengthy list of additives—canola oil, carrageenan, yeast extract, spices and garlic powder—but didn't taste like it. We decided that the texture was chewy and the flavor fell flat. Maddie said it had more moisture than the first chicken, but still wasn't good. Dara thought it browned nicely and had slightly more flavor, but not enough to justify the price. Jennifer called it “very dry and stringy” and said it seemed more suited to a sandwich than a dinner plate (which, if that's your dinner journey, then this is a decent buy)...."

mov_D23E3712A15B4021B7A3F4739138284B,2025-07-01 06:00:00,en,WEB,"  The how, why and when of collagen banking The beauty world is ever evolving and no where is that more evident than in our skincare routines. From the emergence of new ingredients to breakthrough formulations, the skincare world is constantly innovating which is great news for anyone who strives to keep their skin looking its best. In truth, however, while there are a whole host of ingredients out there which promise to improve skin texture, fight fine lines or boost radiance, all these skin concerns all come down to one thing, a building block that's naturally found in our skin itself and which sadly decreases as we get older — collagen. “Collagen is a protein that provides structure and support to our muscles, skin, connective tissues and bones. It is vital for skin firmness, plumpness and elasticity,” says Dr Derrick Phillips. “The body naturally produces collagen to keep the skin healthy, but collagen production slows down with age and can also become depleted prematurely as a result of lifestyle factors such as UV exposure, smoking, and poor diet.” It's in light of this decrease in collagen that many skincare experts have come to hail “collagen banking” as the best way to keep our skin looking its best both now and in the future. So, what exactly does collagen banking mean? I turned to an army of skincare experts to get their expert advice on the how, why and when of collagen banking. You may like Firstly, what is collagen banking? “Collagen banking refers to the idea of early stimulation and preservation of collagen in the skin to prevent or delay signs of aging down the line,” says Dr Sina Ghadiri, Consultant Dermatologist and founder of Sinaesthetics, “the idea being that by 'banking' collagen in your 20s or 30s, you're setting yourself up for smoother, firmer skin later in your 50s, 60s and 70s.” What this means is, “by proactively supporting your skin's collagen production now [through skincare, diet and professional treatments], you [can] help maintain stronger, more resilient skin in the years to come,” says Dr Dev Patel, Aesthetic Physician, Skin Doctor and founder of CellDerma. It's worth noting however, “It's not literally “storing” collagen in reserve,” Dr Ghadiri continued, “but by boosting your skin's natural collagen production capabilities before visible signs of aging occur, the aim would be to maintain a more youthful baseline for longer.” What are the benefits of collagen banking? We've already touched on many of the benefits of collagen banking especially when it comes to our skin but do the experts agree with these claims? Marie Claire Newsletter Celebrity news, beauty, fashion advice, and fascinating features, delivered straight to your inbox! By submitting your information you agree to the Terms & Conditions and Privacy Policy and are aged 16 or over. “​​Collagen banking can improve skin quality, keeping the skin supple, plump and healthy, and reducing the appearance of fine lines, and wrinkles which are the hallmark of premature skin ageing,” says Dr Phillips. Dr Ghadiri agrees, adding that by delaying the onset of fine lines and wrinkles, collagen banking can also “reduce the need for potentially more invasive or aggressive procedures longer term.” And, it's not only your skin that can reap the benefits, “Collagen banking also goes beyond the skin,” says Dr Patel, “Collagen contains amino acids - especially proline - that the body uses to build keratin, the key structural protein in hair. [This means that collagen banking] also supports the health of the scalp and surrounding blood vessels, helping to create an optimal environment for hair growth and strength. Additionally, collagen plays a crucial role in maintaining joint and bone health, offering benefits that go well beyond cosmetics.” When should I start collagen banking? As collagen banking is best used as a preventative method, the earlier you start the better, “Generally, it will be better suited for people from their mid-20s, as from around age 25, collagen production starts declining,” says Dr Ghadiri, “However, those seeing early signs of ageing (e.g. dullness, hollowing, fine lines) or with lifestyle risk factors (UV exposure, stress, smoking, poor sleep) may need to act sooner, and there isn't a one-size-fits-all all policy.” For those who are older, it's never too late to start. “Starting later is better than not starting at all,” explained Dr Phillips, “as you will still see improvements in the look and feel of your skin.” So, exactly how do you start collagen banking? Once again, my experts were on hand with all the best advice… 1. Introduce retinoids “A strong topical skincare regime is paramount,” says Dr Ghadiri. Firstly, retinoids, as “they are strong players in increasing collagen synthesis.” Retinoids work by increasing your skin cell turnover which in turn increases collagen production. Start with a low dosage and build up your tolerance to see the best results. Crystal Retinal 6 Resurfacing Retinol Serum 2. Add Vitamin C Next, introduce Vitamin C into your skincare routine. This works to “stabilise and protect collagen,” Dr Ghadiri continued, and also has “strong photoprotective properties against UV damage."" SkinCeuticals 10% Waterless Vitamin C Serum 3. Peptides + Growth Factors “Bio- and neuro-peptides have been shown to effect positive changes in the architecture of the skin,” says Dr Patel, “so including these ingredients in your skincare routine is going to stimulate collagen production and target the facial expression muscles to soften existing wrinkles” And Dr Ghadiri agreed, “Peptides and growth factors support essential regulatory roles in many processes [including] cell signalling to stimulate collagen production.” Allies of Skin Multi Peptides & Growth Factors Advanced Lifting Serum..."

This list goes on, an American canon built by overlapping culinary influences in what was once a hub for Indigenous tribes and later the trans-Atlantic slave trade, shaped and reshaped by hundreds of years of colonial rule and immigrant flux. Every city has its greatest hits from another century, its repertoire of untouchable classics, but New Orleans is so loaded with them, it can seem a little unfair. It can also give a visitor the wrong impression -- as if, somewhere back there, the city got stuck in time. No, the juice is always running here, and those influences keep bopping together deliciously. Call the Gulf whatever you want. At Acamaya, the chef Ana Castro insists on the connection between Louisiana and Mexico. Ms. Castro nixtamalizes heirloom corn to make chochoyotes, and lately she has immersed the pudgy, dimpled masa dumplings in a slippery green sauce, lush with sweet crab meat, prickling with the warmth of poblano chiles and peppery nasturtium leaves. To collect that crab, Ms. Castro drives 30 miles south from her restaurant in the Bywater neighborhood, past cypress trees slung with Spanish moss, to a centuries-old fishing village called Lafitte. That's where Dottie and Dennis Higgins run Higgins Seafood. Higgins is a tenuous family business, so small it's sometimes just the two of them cooking and picking and packing. To do their work, they rely on Gulf Coast fishermen up against forces beyond their control: a dwindling labor pool, shameless restaurants passing off imported seafood as local, and ferocious storms that batter a disappearing coast. Does the vulnerability of a taste sharpen its pleasure? If Ms. Castro can't get crab from Higgins, you won't find it on the menu at all. But you might find something else -- a surprising guest appearance from some less marketable fish, like strawberry grouper or barracuda, triggerfish or hogfish. Adapting to what purveyors can or can't get is as much a creative choice as a survival skill for some kitchens now -- a way to build interdependence and sustain a community against disasters, big and small. (''The idea that everything must be available at all times is a capitalistic construct,'' Ms. Castro told me over the phone.) Ms. Castro, who was born in Texas and grew up both there and in Mexico City, built her reputation with the Mexican tasting menus she devised at Lengua Madre in New Orleans, where she partnered with the chef and restaurateur Michael Stoltzfus. It was open only a few weeks in 2021 when Hurricane Ida blew the roof off. When the restaurant reopened months later, press and accolades followed -- Ms. Castro was in the national spotlight. She opened Acamaya last year with her sister Lydia Castro, who manages the place. The restaurant is light on its feet, constantly revising and adjusting. Though it doesn't specialize in crowd pleasers for the jazz dads, it knows how to satisfy them with carne asada and a sturdy costra -- here a tunnel of lightly browned cheese that might hold crawfish or shrimp -- on a flour tortilla. The blackened flounder is as Cajun as it is Veracruzana, with a paprika-heavy seasoning seared against the fish, and a briny stew of canned tomatoes and olives, lit with lemon zest. It's elegant grandma cooking (truly, the recipe is borrowed from Ms. Castro's grandma). Some of the riskier dishes play with unflinching bitterness. Results are expansive, as in the inky, crunchy arroz negro, the rice embellished with squid and shrimp, deeper and darker still with a blot of ripe huitlacoche. They can also be extreme, as in the sticky octopus smeared with cacao nib salsa macha and a slightly menacing coffee aioli. The kitchen cooks seafood with expertise, but can seem unnerved by vegetables, which tend to sound more exciting than they taste. A roasted beet dish that promised the flavors of hibiscus, sour cherry and rhubarb landed unexpectedly wet and muffled. There is a spikiness to Acamaya -- don't be fooled by the soft pink glow it emits on Dauphine Street. The restaurant takes some visual and spiritual inspiration from a young, progressive generation of restaurants in Mexico City. The kitchen is open, and the dining room is small but somehow capacious-feeling -- big tables set far apart. There's no tasting menu, but there is an ounce of golden Kaluga caviar on the menu for $90. The caviar course can be predictable, but this one comes with an unlikely extravagance: half a dozen popcorn-scented gorditas, their bubbled exteriors still hot and crackling and salty, ideal for splitting and filling with bean purée and crema -- as well as the requisite cured egg yolk and chives. It might be jarring to spot gorditas and caviar on a menu if you're scanning for chips and salsa, but Acamaya isn't a chips-and-salsa kind of restaurant. It isn't dead-serious, committed to regional specialties, either. It's more idiosyncratic and puckish than that, more brainy and rewarding. Servers are composed, but approachable, and don't tend to explain the dishes much, though you might overhear them consoling diners who were expecting free guac, not crab chochoyotes. There's no easy way to say it: The guac isn't free. Also, there isn't any. Follow New York Times Cooking on Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, TikTok and Pinterest.

An exquisite tinted lip balm shockingly similar to Clinique's ""Black Honey"" but it doesn't cost nearly as much. This weightless, non-sticky formula glides onto your pout to give 'em a subtle polished tint of your choosing. Soon you'll be smackin' your lips all over the place, and no one can blame you when they look this good. ♀ My colleague Emma Lord can vouch for this: ""I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference!"" Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a pink honey version, individually, and as a two-pack that includes both!) . 2. Catrice ""Instant Awake"" Under Eye Brightener — it'll help liven up your tired eyes with a lightweight formula that delivers superb coverage in just a few swipes. This tinted concealer contains hyaluronic acid and shea butter that may also help reduce dark circles over time. It's just like the $33 Becca version but for MUCH less. Promising reviews: ""Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it."" —Placeholder ""I ran across this when looking to replace my $33 Becca under-eye brightening cream, and since money is tight, I took a chance. Very surprised to find this product to be comparable in coverage and staying power, and superior in moisture. Highly recommend!"" —Nancy Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades). 3. A TikTok-beloved ""Soft"" perfume rollerball reviewers can't stop raving about, with some even comparing it to lemon pound cake. YUM! This is gonna be a real treat for your senses *and* it rolls on nice and easy. It's basically a budget-friendly version of Pink Sugar, which goes for $65. Promising review: ""It's definitely a [swap] for Pink Sugar, only better. To me, Pink Sugar has changed and now dries down to a too-forward pepper smell that overpowers the sugar. This doesn't do that, it's exactly like Pink Sugar when it first goes on with sweet and powdery scent profiles, and remains that way after dry down...on me, this is what I'm getting anyway. It lasts and lasts too like a quality oil perfume should."" —Criss Get it from Amazon for $4.50. 4. A lash-extending E.l.f. Cosmetics tubing mascara because your lashes deserve the best and you don't wanna waste your time with dry, clumpy (pricey) formulas. This one is perfect for thin, delicate lashes and is similar to Thrive. The lightweight tubing technology wraps around your eyelashes for a smudge-proof lift that looks natural. Plus, it's super easy to take off at the end of the day without tons of harsh scrubbing. Check out a TikTok of the E.l.f. mascara in action...."

mov_1C64AEDF98FB238873A21483590FA1CF,2025-07-04 07:08:04,en,WEB,"  Monsoon may be romantic, but your skin, hands, and feet often tell a different story. The combination of muddy streets, humidity, wet shoes, and pollution creates a perfect recipe for skin irritation, dullness, and unwanted infections, especially in urban chaos like Mumbai. That's where a seasonal visit to a trusted salon becomes more than a luxury, it's a necessity. Your feet face the brunt of the season, literally. They're stuck in wet shoes, exposed to puddles, and forgotten once home. Monsoon causes the skin on your feet to soften, increasing the risk of infections and cracked heels. A proper pedicure at a salon doesn't just clean, it rejuvenates. From anti-bacterial soaks and exfoliation to hydration masks and massages, it helps restore hygiene and softness. Salons offers monsoon-special pedicures with added exfoliating scrubs and foot masks to prevent infections and boost circulation. If there's one reason to make a salon visit this season, let your feet be it. Constant washing and exposure to rain can leave your hands feeling dry, cracked, and aged. Monsoon hand care isn't just about manicures and pretty nails, it's about restoring softness, removing dead skin, and treating your nails and cuticles with nourishing oils. Look for a salon that includes paraffin dips or deep hydration masks in their monsoon hand rituals. These treatments not only feel luxurious, but they also work to prevent your hands from developing that rough, weather-worn look. Your Face Deserves a Monsoon Detox Too The humidity and pollution of Mumbai during the rains clog pores and leave your skin looking dull. That's where a facial tailored to this season comes in. Treatments like Mary Cohr's CatioVital Facial are designed to deeply cleanse, oxygenate, and hydrate the skin in one go. This facial includes a deep cleanse using steam and ionization, which opens up pores and infuses the skin with active ingredients. It not only clears out pollution and impurities but also revives tired skin that's been dulled by weather and stress. There's something about stepping into a quiet salon on a rainy day that feels instantly calming. The sound of rain outside, the warmth of a facial bed, the feeling of your hair being massaged, all of it combines to give you not just beauty benefits, but mental peace. Mary Cohr offers professional services that combine facial, foot care, and head massage, and many more into a single session, making it the perfect rainy-day ritual. Mumbai, Don't Let the Weather Dim Your Glow Monsoon is a time of chaos, but it can also be a time of pause. Let the rain slow you down just enough to take care of yourself. Whether it's fixing those post-rain feet, reviving your glow with a facial, or softening your hands from all the handwashing, we owe our bodies that little reset. A salon visit this season is no longer an indulgence; it's just smart skincare. Your feet, hands, and face will thank you."

n1hgl22,2025-07-05 15:37:27,en,REDDIT,"  I somewhat disagree. Depending on how bad the acne is, a lot can be achieved in 3.5 weeks. Mighty Patch - get some and use them on pimples. Invest in a skincare routine from The Ordinary. ""IT"" Cosmetics' ""Bye Bye Breakout"" serum is great (salicylic acid, lactic acid, and a postbiotic ferment). From The Ordinary (to get the products as quickly as possible, go to Ulta or Sephora), get a granactive retinoid emulsion (my preference) or a retinol (start with a low %), niacinamide, and a good face wash. If you don't get the Bye Bye Breakout, get salicylic acid from The Ordinary. Get Hyaluronic Acid from The Ordinary. You may need their ""Soothing & Barrier Support Serum,"" too. Wash your face at least every night - every morning, too, if your face is oily. Use the serums and patches after you wash your face - use them in the order I've listed them here. CeraVe & Cetaphil both make great facial moisturizers and body lotions - get some. Use the facial moisturizer at the end of your skincare routine. Use the lotion on your hands EVERY time you wash them. Use the lotion on your body *at least once a day* - be generous with it, take your time to coat every part of your body, and rub/massage it in. Use lotion after every shower/bath. If your skin is really *that* dry,  invest in Kosas Good Body Skin AHA + Enzyme Exfoliating Body Wash AND Glow Recipe's AHA body cream (you can pick whichever scent you'd like). Use the Kosas exfoliating body wash before each shower/bath - apply it to your body, let it sit as directed, then get in the shower/bath and wash it off. After the shower, apply the Glow Recipe AHA body cream. Heritage Store's roll-on castor oil - you can get this and apply this after each shower/before bed BEFORE lotion/body cream to the driest areas of your skin (knuckles, wrists, elbows, etc - wherever is driest). I also really like Everyone's Nourishing Lotion (coconut + lemon) and Ginger Lily Farms' Butter Lotion (available on Amazon in giant gallon bottles, super cheap - be sure to get a pump from Ginger Lily Farms). I have baby soft skin, and these are the products I use. I'm constantly complimented on how soft my skin is. Don't worry, OP! You can do *a lot* about dry skin and acne in 3 weeks. And, if she likes you and isn't a piece of crap, some acne or dry skin isn't going to change that."

It only flares up occasionally so I don't think it's product related. For context: 1. I do not wear make up often. Maybe once or twice a month. 2. I thought it was the mascara I was using so I stopped using it but apparently it's not the mascara. 3. I wash my face with La Roche Posay and have been using it for a couple years now. 4. I alternate between moisturizers (glow recipe, La Roche Posay, & a Korean moisturizer for Amazon meant for sensitive skin) 5. I wash my face with a washcloth, I don't think it's detergent related because again it only flares up occasionally. 6. It's only on my lower eyelids I think I included all important information. Has anyone else suffered from something like this? Any ideas? It makes me so self conscious because it emphasizes lines under my eyes and the darkness around my eyes. Thank you in advance!"

Especially kitchen tiles, which are quickly filled with dirty and fungal (mildew) by constant exposure to moisture. It not only looks bad, but can also be dangerous for health. But don't worry! With the help of some easy home remedies, you can keep your kitchen clean, shiny and smellless even in the rain. 1. Baking soda + white vinegar = superformula of cleaning tiles With this magical mixture it becomes very easy to remove fungal. How to use: Make a paste by mixing equal amounts of baking soda and white vinegar. Apply it on fungal tiles. After 15 minutes rub with a brush and wipe it with a clean cloth. This recipe removes fungal as well as stubborn stains. 2. 2. Get natural glow and fragrance with lemon and salt Lemon's antifungal properties clean the tiles and also give them glow. Cut a lemon, sprinkle salt in it and rub it directly on the tiles. Leave some time and wipe it with a cloth. The fungal will be clean and the kitchen will arise! 3. 3. Hydrogen Peroxide: Firm Treatment of Stubborn Mildew This remedy is the most effective for removing the old fungal layer. Make a spray of a part hydrogen peroxide + by mixing one part of water. Sprinkle on the tiles, leave it for a while, then scrub with a brush. Very effective in eliminating both smell and mildew. The fungal increases with moisture, so it is necessary to come and go. Keep the windows open, run the exhaust fan. If you want, keep camphor or small dehumidifier in the kitchen. After cooking every night, do wipe tiles with dry cloth. The sooner the wet surface is dry, the less the chances of becoming a fungal. Now Chatgpt can also be cheated! Shocking revelations in the report"

Just in time for National Mac & Cheese Day, Panera and trend-forward beauty brand Holler and Glow are cooking up something unexpected: S'Mac and Cheese Lip Balm, a limited-edition balm duo that is equally indulgent and playful, available starting today on The Panera Shop and Amazon. Inspired by Panera's fan-favorite Mac & Cheese and iconic Bread Bowl, this crave-worthy collab brings cozy, carb-inspired comfort to your beauty routine. Each balm is infused with the unmistakable scents of this go-to Panera meal and crafted with Holler and Glow's signature glossy, non-sticky formula, infused with nourishing vitamin E and featuring a spoon-shaped applicator. The duo includes: S'Mac My Day – A golden, mac & cheese-scented balm that's as rich and satisfying as your favorite spoonful. Get That Bread – A toasty bread-scented balm with a soft brown hue, invoking the scent of baked bread with every swipe. “For our first foray into the beauty world, it only made sense to start with a Panera classic – mac & cheese and bread bowl – reimagining it as a playful, scent-sational lip balm duo,” said Mark Shambura, Chief Marketing Officer at Panera Bread. “Could we have gone with the strawberry on our beloved summer seasonal salad? Of course. Ultimately, we decided to offer an unexpected, yet iconic, pairing that is a perfect way for the Panera obsessed to bring a taste of an all-time favorite menu item into their everyday routine.” With the launch of S'Mac and Cheese, Panera takes its first-ever bold step into the beauty world, transforming a fan-favorite comfort food into a crave-worthy cosmetic. Hot on the heels of sell-out moments with its Croissant Clutch and BAGuette Bag, the brand continues to move at the pace of culture - serving up unexpected, deliciously fun ways for fans to show their Panera love. “At Holler and Glow, we live for bold, playful beauty that doesn't take itself too seriously—so when Panera came to us with the idea of turning Mac & Cheese into a lip balm, we said 'yes, please (and make it extra cheesy)!' This collab is the perfect mix of comfort food, nostalgia and beauty-meets-banter. It's unexpected, joyful, and totally irresistible—just like a bread bowl full of mac & cheese,” said Thea Green, Founder of Holler and Glow.

There are more deals than you could ever begin to look through on your own...so that's where we come in. We waded through the mountains of bargains for you and found some of the best deals in every category. FYI — deals move *fast*. We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change! Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. The TikTok-viral Tirtir cushion foundation — for 60% off, a new lowest-ever price! — that offers 72 hours of flawless wear, blending seamlessly to hide redness, blemishes, and under-eye bags. It has buildable coverage, perfect for a natural look or full glam. Plus, it's packed with hibiscus and red propolis extracts for a boost in skin elasticity. And to top it all off, its oval-shaped puff can reach every little corner of your face. Check out this TikTok of Mikayla Nogueira's review of this foundation. Promising review: ""I struggle with finding a foundation that's not orange. Someone recommended I try a Korean product, and this started going viral around the same time. I lucked into a perfect color match on the first try, but I've learned there are sample packs if you aren't sure about the color. The coverage is incredible. It was very lightweight, not heavy at all. It did settle into my under-eye wrinkles without primer, so if you're older, that's something to keep in mind. Overall, beautiful and long-lasting. This will be my go-to foundation from now on."" —AJ Bond Price: $10 (originally $25; available in 40 shades and a mini size) 2. A ""Gracula"" garlic crusher for 57% off, because you know what? If a 108-year-old vampire lurking moodily in the trees in the Pacific Northwest isn't going to fall in love with you and grant you immortality, one might as well make your life in the kitchen a little easier. Promising review: ""I love this little guy. I found him on a BuzzFeed list and had to have it as soon as I saw it! I've minced as many as five cloves in it in seconds. It's a little tricky getting all of the garlic out once minced (I use a silicone basting brush to get most of it, but I always use more than the recipe calls for anyway, so it's not a deal breaker). Cleanup is a breeze because he goes right in the dishwasher!"" —Barbie Price: $9.95 (typically $18.99) 3. Mixsoon Bean Essence for 55% off (the lowest price it's ever been!!) — this TikTok-beloved K-beauty staple for exfoliating and hydrating is a secret weapon that anyone chasing the ~glass skin~ look will want to know about immediately. You can use this as a low-maintenance, high results exfoliant by massaging it into your skin two to three times a week for a smoother, brighter, more even complexion. Promising reviews: ""I saw this all over TikTok/Instagram and decided to buy it because I have a lot of sebaceous filaments on my chin and nose. It's a little expensive but I took a gamble: it works! You can physically see the sebaceous filaments come out of your pores; it is not the product bunching up. My problem areas were so much smoother after using and were left with a moisturized glow. I then proceeded to have my boyfriend use this product to see if it worked this well on everyone on the first try, and it worked on his nose as well. Amazing stuff. "" —Losa ""I have hyperpigmentation and oily skin. I feel this product regulates my oil production and it helps my makeup look so flawless. 10/10."" —MissKayMae..."

From the Battle of Gettysburg to the well-preserved Victorian landmarks in Ridgway, every corner in the state is immaculate. Travel back in time when visiting Wellsboro, a pristine town with gaslit posts and a town square taken from a classic novel. Wander through the Story Book Forest in Ligonier to see childhood tales in three dimensions. While the autumn months light up the entire state, Jim Thorpe is a must-see when paired with a legendary train ride through the diverse landscape. Each town represents a chapter in Pennsylvania's compelling fairytale story. Jim Thorpe Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania, in fall colors. Commonly known as the Little Switzerland of America, Jim Thorpe is a fairytale town in Pennsylvania surrounded by the lush forests of the Pocono Mountains. With a European-style downtown and streets lined with Victorian buildings, Jim Thorpe is a living postcard. Many residents count down the days until the annual Jim Thorpe Fall Festival, when the area comes alive with warm hues. Held on the first three weekends in October, the Fall Festival is jam-packed with local storytellers, live music, craft vendors, and local eateries offering foods and drinks bursting with autumn flavors. One of the best ways to go leaf peeping in Jim Thorpe is by hopping on the Lehigh Gorge Scenic Railway. Although the ride is memorable in any season, it is a phenomenal way to relax and be in awe of Pennsylvania's natural wonder. The town center in Jim Thorpe, Pennsylvania. Image credit zimmytws via Shutterstock The town changed its name to honor Olympic athlete, and one of America's Best, Jim Thorpe. Visitors wishing to pay their respects can head to the Jim Thorpe Memorial. From a statue to various plaques highlighting his accomplishments, along with his final resting place, the area is thoughtfully designed to commemorate the legacy of the legend himself. Lewisburg Bucknell University Science Center and Colonial Style Buildings in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. Beginning its origin in 1785, Lewisburg is a historic Pennsylvania gem that looks like it belongs in a classic film. The downtown area exudes an unbeatable antique charm. Complete with picture-perfect three-globe lamp posts, Lewisburg's ambiance can not be found elsewhere. Book a stay at the Lewisberg Hotel, welcoming guests since 1834. Restored in 1997, the accommodations are an effortless blend of Victorian charm with modern touches. Located just a quick five-minute drive from the hotel, walk the grounds of the iconic Bucknell University. Take a tour of the campus, visit one of the classrooms, or embark on a solo adventure at this reputable liberal arts college. Main Street in Lewisburg, Pennsylvania. Image credit George Sheldon via Shutterstock Relish in that gentle warmth and endless comfort that flourish in small Pennsylvania towns like Lewisburg. Support the economy and take home local delicacies on Wednesdays at the Lewisburg Farmer's Market. Stroll along countless year-round vendors, including some Amish and Mennonite sellers. Bring home fresh Lewisburg produce, cheese, cotton candy, meat, flowers, soaps, donuts, and other goodies. Make a toast and mingle with friends at Fero Vineyards & Winery. Savor a sweet wine, like Dragon Breath, or a specialty wine like Beachy Breeze. With a draft beer menu, dog-friendly winery, and the freedom to bring in outside food, Fero offers something for everyone. Lititz Main Street in Lititz, Pennsylvania. Image credit Amy Lutz via Shutterstock Lititz is an enchanting town with a dreamlike atmosphere, where waves of old-world charm echo throughout. The streets are inviting with a seamless blend of red brick buildings, adorable eateries, quaint shops, flags hanging proudly, and stereotypical American homes. Cafe Arabella perfectly captures the overall vibe in Lititz. Pair a handcrafted coffee with some coffee cake, French toast, or an omelette. Feel all of life's stress melt away while soaking in the homey spirit. Being in the heart of Pennsylvania Dutch Country, having a treat at Julius Sturgis Pretzel Bakery is essential. Sink your teeth into a soft pretzel or appreciate a crunchy chocolate-covered creation.

Chef David Thompson talks flavour, chaos, chocolate, and why Thai food still thrills him, 40 years on Chef David Thompson took Sunday mid day (and our 11-year-old plus one) straight into the kitchen for a hands-on masterclass in green Thai curry. Pic/Raj Patil We'd been warned — Chef David Thompson's humour is, well, esoteric. Bold, even. And more often than not, it kicks off with the F-word. But when we met him at EHV International's Fireback Mumbai, he was calmer, more affable — still razor-sharp, and wickedly funny. His wit doesn't keep you out — you feel like an insider in his jokes. What followed was a fun, heartwarming conversation, after which he whisked us, along with our 11-year-old companion, straight into the kitchen to teach him how to make a proper green Thai curry. Thompson is patient in the kitchen, generous with his time, and peppers his teaching with his signature dry humour. What emerges is far from the watered-down versions we've come to expect — it's raw, robust, and unapologetically bold. Widely regarded as one of the world's leading authorities on Thai cuisine, Thompson brings far more than recipes to Fireback (named after Thailand's national bird, the Siamese Fireback). First introduced in Goa last year, the concept builds on Thai cooking's primal rhythm, where spice and texture aren't mere accents, but integral to the structure. There's no overthinking, no heavy-handed reinterpretation — just confident, flavour-forward food. Opening July 14 in Mumbai, the space is designed by Russell Sage Studio. and balances raw, tactile materials with clean lines and subtle nods to Thai design. A sculptural light feature undulates across the ceiling, casting a soft glow over the textured surfaces. Below, a long, sculpted bar anchors the room — easygoing by day, electric by night, much like the rhythm of Thai street life. At the helm is Brand Chef Kaustubh Haldipur, leading a crew that has been trained under Thompson in Bangkok. He says, “We are thrilled to bring Fireback to Mumbai. The food has proven to be bold, unique, and unlike most Thai offerings in the city. In a place like Mumbai, where diners are curious and open, this style will truly thrive. Working closely with Chef David, I've learned that Thai cuisine is about more than spice—it's about rhythm, restraint, and deep respect for ingredients. We're not reinventing the cuisine, just presenting it with honesty.” Kaustubh Haldipur The drinks programme follows suit. Crafted by Varun Sharma, Head of Bars at EHV International, the cocktails lean into Thai ingredients with inventive flair with drinks like The Thai Spiced Diablo that mixes tequila with tomato water and wasabi foam; the Tom Yum Highball pairs gin with guava and lemongrass cordial; while the Mango Rice takes cues from the iconic dessert, blending rum with mango and rice cordial. To complement the complexity of the food, Kevin Rodrigues has curated a thoughtful wine list, available by the glass. It is fruit-forward, aromatic, and perfectly lifts the spice. The menu plays out like a quiet conversation between the familiar and the unexpected. We began with Miang Kham (Rs 595) — a textural betel leaf bundle layered with pomelo, toasted coconut, and roasted peanuts. The Spring Roll (Rs 595) with shiitake mushroom, garlic chives and glass noodles was comforting, while the Mushroom Larb (Rs 795), a northern-style herb salad with toasted rice powder and chilli, brought a gentler heat. The Pineapple Som Tam (Rs 595), a sweet-sour twist on the classic papaya salad, balanced tamarind, palm sugar and crushed peanuts with a punch of freshness. Mango & Sticky rice From the Josper grill, the Prawns Nahm Jim  (Rs 1195) arrived smoky and succulent, with a lively mix of garlic, chillies, coriander root, lime, fish sauce, and palm sugar. And there was the Chicken Gorlae (Rs 675), marinated, double-basted, and triple-grilled. The Mango sticky rice (Rs 750)was beautifully done — fragrant, not too sweet, and comforting. The Grilled banana (Rs 595) with Thai crispy roti and condensed milk ice cream was indulgent, unexpected, and the kind of dessert you don't share — the perfect finish. Spring roll; (right) Coconut and Galangal Soup Fireback Mumbai WHERE: Nilaya Anthology, Peninsula Corporate Park, Lower Parel TO BOOK: 022 35387627 'I want to go to Kerala and eventually work with farmers' One word to describe the Fireback Mumbai launch? Vivacious. Because it's full of flavour, fun, new tastes — and maybe even a few dishes you haven't tried before. What's one ingredient that never leaves your kitchen? Thai or otherwise. If you ever want to bribe me — and I'm very open to it — bring chocolate...."

The science behind ""red sky at morning, sailor's warning "" reveals a fascinating intersection of atmospheric physics, light behavior, and meteorological patterns that continues to amaze modern scientists. The ""red sky at morning "" warning traces its roots back thousands of years to ancient civilizations who depended entirely on natural signs for weather prediction. Mediterranean sailors were among the first to document this phenomenon, passing down the knowledge through generations of maritime families. Ancient Greek and Roman texts reference the crimson dawn as a harbinger of rough seas and dangerous sailing conditions. Archaeological evidence suggests that even Bronze Age cultures recognized the connection between morning sky colors and incoming weather systems. These early observers lacked scientific instruments but possessed something equally valuable: generations of careful observation and pattern recognition. Their survival often depended on reading nature's subtle signals correctly.

These early observers lacked scientific instruments but possessed something equally valuable: generations of careful observation and pattern recognition. Their survival often depended on reading nature's subtle signals correctly. When sunlight enters Earth's atmosphere, it encounters countless particles that scatter different wavelengths of light in various directions. Blue light, with its shorter wavelength, scatters more readily than red light, which has a longer wavelength. This principle, known as Rayleigh scattering, explains why we see blue skies on clear days and red skies under certain atmospheric conditions. During sunrise, sunlight must travel through more atmosphere to reach our eyes, filtering out most blue light along the way. The remaining red and orange wavelengths create the dramatic colors we associate with dawn. However, the intensity and distribution of these colors depend heavily on atmospheric conditions, particularly the presence of water vapor and dust particles.

Weather systems moving from west to east across most temperate regions create predictable patterns that ancient observers learned to read. When high pressure systems dominate an area, they typically bring clear, stable conditions with minimal cloud cover. These systems allow morning sunlight to penetrate the atmosphere with less obstruction, often producing beautiful but relatively pale sunrise colors. High pressure areas also tend to suppress the formation of new cloud systems, leading to several days of fair weather. Experienced weather watchers know that pale or golden morning skies often indicate continued pleasant conditions. The absence of dramatic red coloring suggests that the atmosphere contains fewer particles and moisture that would signal approaching storms.
