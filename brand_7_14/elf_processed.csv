Soot sprite dryer balls that'll look sooo cute bouncing around in your dryer. Besides being adorable, they prevent you from having to buy dryer sheets over and over again. They might even reduce drying time, prevent wrinkles, and soften clothes, all without coating your stuff in a waxy residue like the sheets do. Dryer balls are eco-friendly *and* budget friendly because you can use them over and over. Friendsheep is a small business that sells dryer balls handmade by women in Kathmandu, Nepal. Promising review: ""These are so incredibly cute! I love that they look like soot sprites! I used them today and noticed a significant decrease in drying time. No static, and able to be scented with essential oils. A great alternative to polyester, single-use dryer sheets."" —Daria Get a pack of three from Amazon for $18 (also available in nine other designs). 2. An airtight Deli ProKeeper people on FridgeTok (yes, real thing) are raving about. It offers a sleek-looking place for your cold cuts and cheese, keeping it fresh for longer so you can actually eat all of it. If you've ever lamented seeing condensation-soaked ham in your deli drawer, this one is for you. Promising review: ""I bought this because I have the outlandish idea that my refrigerator will look just like those on TikTok, but I am pleasantly surprised to find that it keeps my cold cuts fresher for much longer than expected. It's large enough to hold a pound or more of cold cuts or cheese, which is a bonus. The sealing technology is superb and strong. At one point, I almost could not open the container due to the seal being so airtight. Not only does this product look good in my fridge, but it is saving me money, so definitely a win-win for me."" —IrishEyes Get it from Amazon for $18.04 (also available in another style). 3. And a Bluapple that extends the life of your produce without any extra work from you. Just toss it into your fridge or fruit bowl, and the packet inside will absorb ethylene gas (the main culprit behind mushy apples and overripe bananas). Produce could last two or three times longer, and you'll finally get to eat everything you buy. BluApple is a small business founded in 2009 to help combat food waste. Each packet lasts three months — when it's done, you can open the packet and sprinkle the contents on your houseplant as fertilizer. Snag some refills here. Promising review: ""These do seem to work, extending the life of my fruits and vegetables up to a week longer. Change the packet inside on schedule. I shake them occasionally and make sure that no produce is covering the top holes. I bought more for family/friends when I told them about it. No food is more expensive than that which you throw away (thanks, Mom)."" —ttmadison Get a two-pack from Amazon for $16.99. 4. L'Oréal Paris BB Cream, a green-tinted formula that combats redness through the power of color theory. It doesn't stop there — it also works to even complexion, hydrate with vitamin E, and set the perfect stage for you to apply your makeup on. Turns out you don't have to drop $50+ on Dr Jart+'s Cicapair Color Correcting Cream! This starts green and blends into a ""universal shade,"" which may not be a perfect match for fair or dark skin. Promising review: ""I swear by this. Been using it for about a year now, it goes on every day and gets all the redness off my face, when I'm in a hurry I just top it off with a little powder and I'm done but it's a perfect base layer for any makeup routine if you had a lot of redness like I do."" –Andrea Get it from Amazon for $9.08+ (available in two sizes and also other styles). 5. An ultra-affordable E.l.f. color corrector that comes in a ton of shades to help counteract different types of discoloration, like redness and dark spots...."

mxtaicd,2025-06-14 22:15:02,en,REDDIT,"  First of all, your nails look great, so keep up the great work! In terms of learning to paint your nails better, it all comes down to practice! [Here's an article with some tips & tricks from bloggers](https://www.nailcarehq.com/how-to-paint-nails) on how to paint your nails like a pro! You could also look up more videos on YouTube, as there are a ton of tutorials there as well! The main thing is learning polish control, making sure that there isn't too much polish on the brush but there's still enough that you can coat the entire nail without having to dip back into the bottle. This will come with practice & will change depending on the length of your nails. What I like to do is kinda wiggle the wand (what the brush is attached to) against the inside of the neck of the bottle to make sure there isn't a bunch of polish that's gonna drip down & then swipe most of the polish off one side of the brush. [Here's a little video to better explain!] (https://www.reddit.com/user/juleznailedithelps/comments/ka06vu/polish_control/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) When painting your nails, you're bound to end up with polish somewhere you don't want it to be. You can use a toothpick, a cuticle pusher, or anything small and pointed to kinda scrape the flooded polish out of your cuticles. After removing that excess polish, you can take a small brush (angled eyeliner brushes or small concealer brushes work great for this!) dipped in acetone to gently clean up any remaining polish on your cuticles. The $1 E.L.F. concealer/eyeliner brushes are a super popular option for clean up brushes! I also like to use a [dappen dish](https://www.sallybeauty.com/nails/acrylic-nails/glass-dappen-dish/SBS-154855.html) (you can also buy them on Amazon!) to pour my acetone into so I'm not having to dip into the big container of acetone (a few people have accidentally dropped their brushes in the bottle lol)."
mov_4BA1074EF5062AE34EA2E493B4E8E59B,2025-06-14 22:18:32,en,WEB,"  “[NASCAR is] not easy. It's one of the hardest championships to chase in the world because of the strength and depth,” said Legge. Katherine Legge's motorsport resume reads like a world tour of high-speed excellence. From setting the fastest qualifying lap ever by a woman at the Indy 500 in 2023, to claiming North America's first major open-wheel victory at Long Beach in 2005. She has competed in IndyCar, Formula E, the Pikes Peak Hill Climb, sports car endurance races like Sebring and Daytona, and even dirt racing and touring cars. A seasoned road-course specialist, her international recognition and adaptability made her a standout in the racing world, earning respect well beyond her native England. Although she first sampled NASCAR's Xfinity Series in 2018, earning a notable 14th-place run at Road America, Legge's full commitment to stock cars has come into sharper focus this year. With backing from brands like e.l.f. Cosmetics, DropLight, and Desnuda Tequila, she has secured entries in five Cup Series and multiple Xfinity races. The high point came in March with her Cup debut for Live Fast Motosports at Phoenix Raceway, becoming the first woman in NASCAR's top series since Danica Patrick in 2018. Now, Katherine Legge arrives in Mexico City, a city known for its intense racing culture, as NASCAR debuts its first-ever Cup Series road race outside the U.S. With her established pedigree around the world, she is all set to find that groove, inspiring a new generation of drivers along the way. Katherine Legge embraces the NASCAR grind in Mexico Legge has reasons to be optimistic this weekend as she is one of the few drivers who have notched up a win at the Autódromo Hermanos Rodríguez circuit. Back in 2019, she won the Jaguar I-PACE eTROPHY event, and that experience will be crucial when she takes on the field on Sunday. In a recent interview with Sports on Prime, she mentioned how she is in the era of finding her passion once again. “I'm in my NASCAR era at the moment and I love it. I'm having so much fun,” Legge remarked. “So it's quite an experience coming into Mexico City for the first time in NASCAR because everybody is learning together and everybody's been super kind and amenable and it's great to be back here.” With her debut in the NASCAR Cup Series at Phoenix Raceway, driving the #78 Live Fast Motorsports, Legge focused on keeping the car clean and gaining experience rather than contending for position, ultimately finishing 31st after starting 35th. She found herself centered in a controversy after she caught Daniel Saurez in a wreck, but that hasn't stopped her from learning and adding more races to her schedule. And so far, Mexico has been treating the British driver well. As for the Mexico City track, Legge has had enough experience for the challenge. “I've raced here twice in the past,” continued Legge. “We won the last time I was here so different track configuration. I don't remember it at all. I've hit the wall too many times in between then and now. I have a lot of road course experience and a vast array of different things you know.” These are vivid memories that Legge recounted of her previous Mexico outing. Expand Post But even with immense experience in stock car racing, it is difficult to acclimate oneself to the Next Gen cars that NASCAR has very recently introduced to the racing scenario. “I've driven everything apart from Aussie V8s now I think at this point in time,” said Legge. “I'm hoping that it serves me well. I think people think that driving a race car is like driving a road car and in reality it's not the same at all. Like these things are big and heavy and brutal and they beat you up and it's hard.” Reflecting on her crash-heavy Cup debut at Phoenix Raceway, where contact with Josh Berry led to a spin and collision with Daniel Suarez and her Xfinity accident at Rockingham, Legge has been tested both physically and mentally. Yet, she leans on her diverse experience to cope with it. “It's the toughest thing that she's ever come across,” said the Live Fast team owner, BJ McLeod of Legge, adapting to the Cup Series. “I don't know that she would tell you that, but I can tell you that the group of drivers that get to do [Cup] every week are truly some of the best drivers in the world… They truly are that good, and it makes it extremely difficult for her because even if she's equally as talented, she doesn't get to race every week. She is the only part-timer that's trying to get out there, get up to speed and she has very limited stock car experience.” Nonetheless, Legge remains passionate about her return to the Mexico City track as fans fuel up her energy and enthusiasm over the weekend. But will Legge finally have a breakthrough? Or will she need a little more time to adapt to NASCAR's changing conditions? Starting lineup for Viva Mexico 250 Just like Katherine Legge, another road course ringer who is the top contender this weekend is Kiwi driver Shane van Gisbergen. With limited road course racing so far in 15 races, he wasn't able to make a case for himself. But as NASCAR switched lanes to twists and turns in Mexico, SVG finally came through as he has won the pole for the Cup Series race. SVG went to the top in the qualifying rounds with a lap time of 1:32.776s in the #88 Chevrolet, and no one could match his strides. Sitting 33rd in the playoff standings, a start from the pole could see him bag a huge win and mark a comeback. Ryan Preece from RFK Racing will join him on the front row as he denied Trackhouse Racing lockout on the front row, with Ross Chastain starting the race third. “We had a lot more front grip, which is what I needed. But my laps were average...."

Lip Stains sind die Geheimwaffe für alle, die sich einen natürlichen, langanhaltenden Farbkick auf den Lippen wünschen.

Wir verraten dir alles über die revolutionären Lippentönungen und stellen die sechs besten Lip Stains vor, die dein Make-up-Game ab sofort für immer verändern werden. Wie funktioniert ein Lip Stain? Lip Stains (oder auch Lip Tints genannt) sind flüssige Lippentönungen, die deine Lippen von innen heraus färben, anstatt nur oberflächlich zu wirken. Anders als herkömmliche Lippenstifte oder Glosse ziehen sie in die oberen Hautschichten ein und hinterlassen eine natürlich wirkende Farbe, die stunden- oder sogar tagelang hält. Je nach Produkt bleibt die Farbe auf den Lippen oder du musst sie abwischen bzw. abziehen. Das Beste daran? Sie überstehen problemlos Mahlzeiten, Getränke und sogar intensive Knutscherei, hehe. #1 Wonderskin – Wonder Blading Lip Stain Peel Off Masque Die Mutter aller Lip Tints kommt definitiv von der Brand Wonderskin. Der innovative Lip Stain ist zunächst tatsächlich knallblau, doch keine Sorge, bei dieser Farbe bleibt's nicht. Du trägst den Lip Tint auf, lässt es kurz einwirken und ziehst dann die blaue Peeling-Schicht ab. Zurück bleibt eine perfekte, natürliche Tönung, die bis zu 10 Stunden hält. Die Formel mit natürlichen Fruchtextrakten und pflegenden Ölen ist vegan, tierversuchsfrei und in ganzen 36 (!) verschiedenen Nuancen erhältlich. Die revolutionäre Peel-off-Technologie sorgt zudem dafür, dass sich die Farbe an dein natürliches Lippenrot anpasst und einen individuellen Look kreiert, der auf dich zugeschnitten ist.

Buttery soft high-waisted leggings giving Lululemon and other pricey brands a run for their money, according to some reviewers. They're squat-proof, stretchy, and actually stay up without rolling down! Promising reviews: ""I can't say enough great things about these leggings! They don't roll down, and they feel amazing on. I have all kinds of brands Lululemon, Vuori, Athleta, etc. and these are my favorites and the ones I feel the best and most confident in!! And you can't beat the price — it's a win-win. I will be back to purchase even more colors!"" —Lauren ""The stitching and logo placement is similar to Lulu; however, these feel more compressive and thicker than Aligns, which I prefer. Lulu stretches over time and for a fraction of the price, this entire line feels way better."" —Fiona Get them from Amazon for $29+ (available in women's sizes XXS–XXL, two inseams, and 22 colors). 2.

It has five different head attachments for targeting different muscle groups, plus five speeds to customize the intensity. Your sore muscles, tense neck, and deep knots are ready for some much-needed relief. Promising reviews: ""Helps with pain relief and massage in pressure spots I wasn't able to get before. I had access to use a TheraGun before and haven't noticed any difference between items, and it's at a much lower price point. Whatever extra TheraGun features there might be, I haven't needed and the heads are interchangeable between TheraGun and this. Very happy with my purchase."" —tauntaun ""I used a TheraGun for about a month and although it was great, this unit is better suited for my needs. I found the TheraGun to be too powerful on the lowest setting and bulky to handle. Some people prefer a lower setting than the 'professional' brand offers. This unit is also easier to handle when massaging my partner than the TheraGun. This gun goes from comfortable low setting to very powerful on the highest setting. Much better fit for me and my partner, plus it's got a solid battery life."" —Pierremoe Get it from Amazon for $74.99 (available in seven colors). 3. E.l.f.

This clear gel sunscreen offers SPF 35 and goes on so smooth and lightweight, you'll immediately forget you're wearing it — no white cast here, folks. It doubles as a blurring primer, so it's great for wearing under makeup too! If you love Supergoop but the price is becoming hard to swallow...may I suggest trying this, because it's *very* similar. The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop's cult-fave product end. I've tried both, and I honestly prefer this E.l.f. version. Supergoop's had a slight graininess to it that I didn't love, while this E.l.f. sunscreen is exactly what I'd hoped Supergoop's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top! Promising review: ""This sunscreen is a gem. I was not expecting to love it as much as I do. I absolutely love E.l.f. products, but I rarely try their skincare. Something told me to try this...."

Halo Glow Skin Tint is a tinted, light coverage foundation serum that contains SPF. • Shades: 18 available; priced at $18 — one of the highest priced products for e.l.f. • Formula: Tinted sunscreen serum foundation featuring mineral SPF 50. • Packaging: Squeeze tube that dispenses drops. • Availability: Sold at most major retailers in stores and online, but is still being rolled out. I have the elf Halo Glow Skin Tint in the shade 1 Fair Neutral. I am doing swatches, a review, and three wear tests on acne prone, combo, oily skin. Details & Claims The elf Halo Glow Skin Tint is a lightweight, buildable coverage serum foundation. It contains mineral SPF 50 in the form of zinc oxide, which provides UVA and UVB protection. Since this product is tinted, that counteracts the white cast. It claims to sink into the skin with a serum feeling. elf markets it as a do-it-all product for serum/skincare, SPF 50, and skin tint. It comes in 18 shades for $18 each, and it contains 1 fl oz of product. That is standard foundation size. The shade range is organized into six families with three undertones. This product is non-comedogenic and water resistant up to 80 minutes. This product will be rolled out to major retailers both in stores and online over the couse of the year. The full list of retailers is elf Cosmetics, Amazon, Ulta, Walgreens, CVS, Walmart, and Target. When it comes to how to use the Halo Glow Skin Tint SPF 50, start by shaking it well. Then, apply five drops to your face by using your fingers, a brush, or a sponge. You may apply more as needed to acheive your desired level of coverage. Swatches & Shades Below you can see swatches of 1 Fair Neutral. Ingredients The key ingredients in the elf Halo Glow Skin Tint are zinc oxide (the mineral SPF 50), niacinamide to brighten the skin, and bisabolol to soothe the skin. Allantonin also gets a mention. The actual ingredient list varies from shade to shade. Below are the ingriedient lists provided by elf Cosmetics: 1 Fair Neutral – Ingredients: Water, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Isododecane, Lauryl PEG-8 Dimethicone, Tridecyl Salicylate, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Propanediol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Caprylyl Methicone, Dimethicone, Niacinamide, C13-15 Alkane, Silica, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Sodium Chloride, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Phenoxyethanol, Bisabolol, Lecithin, Caprylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Aluminum Hydroxide, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene Glycol, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Sodium Hydroxide May Contain: Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499) 2 Fair Warm – Ingredients: Water, C12-15 Alkyl Benzoate, Lauryl PEG-8 Dimethicone, Tridecyl Salicylate, Isododecane, Propanediol, Butyloctyl Salicylate, Calcium Sodium Borosilicate, Dimethicone, Niacinamide, C13-15 Alkane, Caprylyl Methicone, Silica, Polyglyceryl-2 Dipolyhydroxystearate, Polyglyceryl-3 Polyricinoleate, Sodium Chloride, Octyldodecyl Neopentanoate, Disteardimonium Hectorite, Phenoxyethanol, Bisabolol, Lecithin, Caprylyl Glycol, Allantoin, Aluminum Hydroxide, Polyglyceryl-4 Diisostearate/Polyhydroxystearate/Sebacate, Hydrogenated Lecithin, Ethylhexylglycerin, Hexylene Glycol, Tetrasodium Glutamate Diacetate, Sodium Hydroxide May Contain: Titanium Dioxide (CI 77891), Iron Oxides (CI 77491, CI 77492, CI 77499) Review To set you up for the three rigourous wear tests that I performed, I want to re-iterare my skin type. I have fair skin that is acne prone and I get oily in my t-zone, specifically on the forehead and nose. I also have combination skin. Mix all of this with my decade of experience reviewing this brand and makeup in general. For all of these tests I applied my normal four step skincare routine of Vitamin C serum, collagen peptide serum, moisturizer, and sunscreen. I trust these products to layer well with makeup and not make my oily. I also did not use primer, and I used a basic setting spray that does nothing for wear time. I allow each layer of my skincare routine to sit on my skin and absorb for a time before moving to the next product. You might stop here questioning why I used sunscreen when elf markets this product as a sunscreen. In order to get adequate sun protection you need to apply 1/2 tsp of susncreen to your face. You will never apply that much of a skin tint, no matter show sheer it is. You would look crazy if you did, similar to slathering your face with peanut butter. SPF skin tints are not a replacement for sunscreen. Please wear them with sunscreen. Also, always shake this product well before applying...."

With a steady 10% annual return, that could stack up to around $2.19 million in 30 years. But here's the truth—getting that return consistently in the real world is no joke. It takes strategy, patience, and the right mindset. The S&P 500 averages about 10.3% annually, but real wealth-builders often go beyond “average”—by tapping into growth stocks. Take NVIDIA (NVDA), racing toward 2025 with explosive growth from AI innovation. Amazon (AMZN) is still a global force, while even emerging brands like e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) are making major portfolio moves. The question is—are these your golden tickets or ticking time bombs?

Cosmetics is diving into personalized beauty with its new “color e.l.f.nalysis” tool, hosted on Pinterest, aiming to simplify the color analysis trend for consumers seeking the perfect makeup and clothing shades. The tool leverages AI to analyze user selfies and provide tailored product recommendations. E.l.f. Cosmetics' New Color analysis Tool explained The beauty brand's microsite, developed in collaboration with Pinterest, allows users to either upload a selfie or take one using their webcam. The “color e.l.f.nalysis” tool then assesses the image, determining the user's hue (warm or cool), value (light or deep contrast), and chroma (bright or muted). Based on thes factors, the tool assigns the user a “color season,” which is a category of colors designed to complement their features. users receive a customized Pinterest board featuring E.l.f. products that align with their assigned color season. Did You Know? Seasonal color analysis gained significant traction in 1980 with the release of Carole Jackson's “Color Me Beautiful,” which categorized individuals into winter, spring, summer, and fall based on their coloring. For instance, someone identified as a “soft autumn” might receive recommendations for E.l.f.'s Camo Liquid Blush in Peach Perfect and Smoky Kohl Eyeliner in Vintage Denim. Users can then seamlessly purchase these recommended products directly from E.l.f.'s website thru the Pinterest pins. The Rise of Color Analysis and Pinterest's Role This initiative taps into the growing popularity of seasonal color analysis, a method for determining the most flattering makeup and clothing colors. The trend initially went viral on TikTok in 2023 and has as evolved with social media and digital tools. Pinterest reported a staggering 1.6 billion makeup-related searches and a 22-fold increase in “color season analysis” searches within the past year, according to Katie Dombrowski, VP of CPG at Pinterest. Pro Tip: Understanding your color season can help you make more informed purchasing decisions, saving you time and money on makeup and clothing that doesn't suit you. “it's clear consumers are craving personalized beauty experiences,” Dombrowski stated. Pinterest's Push into Commerce This partnership aligns with Pinterest's broader strategy to expand its advertising business and become a more prominent player in the e-commerce landscape.This year, pinterest has recruited former executives from Meta and Amazon to bolster its advertising capabilities and transform the platform into a performance marketing channel for brands. Shoppable Social Media: E.l.f. and Pinterest Patrick O'Keefe, E.l.f.'s chief integrated marketing officer,emphasized that the combination of the color analysis trend and Pinterest's strong influence on purchasing decisions made the platform an ideal launchpad for the campaign. “We know Pinners aren't just pinning-they're shopping; 85% of weekly Pinners say they've made a purchase from a Pin,” O'Keefe said. By launching its own tool, E.l.f. can directly recommend its products, bypassing third-party recommendations frequently enough found in other color analysis resources. The company also collaborated with Pinterest creators Autumn Rain, Kirra Dickinson, and Karla Cervantes to develop and promote Pinterest-first content centered around the tool. Other Brands Embracing Color Analysis E.l.f. Beauty is not the first to capitalize on the color analysis trend. In 2023, NYX Professional Makeup partnered with Snapchat to launch “Beauty Bestie,” an augmented reality filter that suggested NYX products based on users' coloring. This initiative also aligns with E.l.f.'s history of leveraging trends in its marketing efforts. Last year, the brand released “Get ready with Music, The Album,” a 16-song collection designed for makeup application.E.l.f. has also collaborated with celebrities like Joey King, Megan Stalter, and Meghan Trainor.

Award: Best nail tips | Overall score: 4.17/5 | Kit includes: 30 tips, buffer and file, cuticle stick, glue | Good for: All nail types ""I love the design of these!"" says associate editor Kamari Stewart. ""They're a fun summery take on the classic French style. This kit was really easy to use. Since this design is a short almond shape, you need to make sure your nails are fully cut/filed down so they don't poke out the sides."" Stewart also says the included glue helps these nail tips stay on for the two-week period that the brand claims, so she was able to work, clean and do other everyday activities without one chipping or falling off. This lightweight serum from E.l.f. is said to make skin appear more radiant while remaining non-greasy. Award: Best antioxidant serum | Overall score: 5/5 | Size: 1 oz. | Key ingredients: Vitamin C, vitamin E, ferulic acid | Skin type: Dry, oily and combo skin When it comes to incorporating vitamin C into your routine, experts recommend starting with a small dose, to see how your skin reacts before plunging in completely. This product contains 15% vitamin C, which is the ""sweet spot,"" per experts. Anything more or less will either be too harsh on the skin, or not as effective, they say. Editor's Pick Whether you're dealing with flyaways or simply want to pull off the classic slick-back bun, this hair wand can help make it happen. One editor found it helped to reduce frizz and even smooth bumps in her ponytail. Award: Best overall styling cream | Overall Score: 5/5 | Size : 20 ml | Key ingredients: Dragon fruit, prickly pear seed oil and cactus flower extract | Hair types: Medium, fine or thick hair ""This product offers a lovely fragrance, a weightless feel that won't burden your hair and versatile styling — ideal for both air drying and blowouts,"" said Sarah Hoeger, member of our Mom Squad and mother of associate editor, Sierra Hoeger. This Versed multi-serum is super lightweight, blends easily and is editor-approved Award: Best 2-in-1 tinted moisturizer | Overall score: 4.5/5 | Size: 1.0 oz. | Shades: 14 | Key ingredients: Zinc oxide, hyaluronic acid If you're anything like our editors, you dislike the feeling of heavy foundations or makeup products sitting on your face — which is why one of them gave this tint a perfect 5/5 score. ""I was impressed!"" says editorial operations manager, Jill Ortiz. ""I liked the way it felt on my skin and it was easy to find my shade online."" Other editors appreciated the inclusion of hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, to give their skin a much-needed moisturizing boost. This lip liner is fool-proof and effortlessly enhances your natural lip shape. Award: Best overall lip liner | Overall score: 4.66/5 | Shades: 5 | Key ingredients: Shea butter, jojoba oil, meadowfoam oil, mango seed oil This lip liner not only glides on with ease, but it stays on for long periods of time — lasting our editors nearly an entire day. Its ingredient list helps to achieve smoother, softer lips that still have a pop of color. This blush can blur and set, making it a great blush to add to your collection. Award: Best 2-in-1 blush | Overall score: 4.17/5 | Colors: 7 | Talc-free? : Yes | Safe for sensitive skin? : Yes | Sweat-proof? : Yes For lighter, brighter skin, Mom Squad member, Jude Bender (mother of senior SEO editor, Jess Bender), recommends this 2-in-1 product from buzzy brand, Tower 28...."

A pair of waterproof wireless earbuds that look just like AirPods Pro — *but* these have an LED display to show you the battery percentage on the case. These don't have noise cancellation like the Pros do, but if that's not something you're looking for, this swap will help you save a LOT of pretty pennies. The earbuds last up to 6 hours on a single charge and are sweatproof, meaning they can transition seamlessly from your phone call to a running session around your neighborhood. Promising review: ""I use these every day at work! Love these — easy to learn and to use. Best thing about them? Well, everything, lol. Good sound, they hold a charge for long periods, and I don't have to worry about them losing power. I can answer my phone easily and then go back to music without a problem.

It has 10 hours of battery life, too! iJoy is a small business that specializes in headphones and tech accessories. Check out why BuzzFeed Shopping writer Emma Lord loves these: I own a pair of these, and because I'm vain as heck and need to own all things pink, but I was decently surprised by how well they muffle noise! I feel like these are ideal for people who still want to hear some of the world around them (read: parents, people working in open offices), but still want to listen to their tunes comfortably. The charge on these goes for at least four hours (I haven't tried it beyond that yet), and the Bluetooth connects to my devices super easily. Excellent pair of headphones for the price point. Promising review: ""To be honest, I wanted the Apple ones because I felt it would be better for me, but my financial situation wouldn't allow me to get them. I made the decision to get these. These are very cute and comfortable. I have really enjoyed them...The sound is good and the calls are clear. Great for the price. I haven't been disappointed. So if you're in a bind and need headphones, you will definitely love these. They are not 100% soundproof, but they do have some noise reduction, and your caller can still hear you clearly outside."" —Carolinee J. Cowart Get it from Amazon for $19.99+ (available in five colors). 3. A cubic zirconia ring that looks so much like a Cartier Love Ring, people will think you dropped BANDS for it. People will undoubtedly compliment your bling, so in the words of Mel Robbins — let them. ☺ Promising review: ""The perfect non-name-brand ring you can find honestly. I wasn't looking for a Cartier knock-off when I found this ring, but I have had people ask me if it's the real deal. I honestly love this ring though, the sizing was accurate, it is weighted well, none of the 'diamonds' have fallen off, and it hasn't tarnished! I've worn it daily for almost a year now and it has held up well. It has some very small scratches on it, but that's typical of most rings. For the price, I am super happy with this ring, and I honestly can't believe how well it has handled everything I've put it through."" —Eva Richterkessing Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in sizes 5–12, three finishes, and two styles). 4.

Cosmetics。 同为美妆品牌的Hero Cosmetics在2022年以6.3亿美元出售。 虽然都是美妆品牌，都是身价近10亿，但这两个品牌的增长路径是完全不同的。 依靠Amazon单SKU优化起家的Hero，代表的是传统电商的可预测模式：发现市场空白→ 开发产品→优化流量→ 通过平台效率实现规模化。 遵循同样路径的还有大家都熟悉的Anker。 Rhode等品牌，则把Amazon等平台视为分销渠道，而非品牌发现的起点。 Rhode的Hailey有55M粉丝，SKIMS的Kim有365M粉丝，Kylie Cosmetics的Kylie Jenner有395M粉丝，Prime Hydration的Logan Paul & KSI共有40M粉丝。 ——这些品牌先拥有粉丝，以及他们的注意力，而产品在发布前就已经被“预售”了。 这其实是两类品牌： ❶电商品牌(Marketplace Seller)——在广告费用日益增长的平台生态中争夺注意力。 更优越的产品创新或供应链效率是它们的主要竞争优势。 ❷创作者品牌(Creator-led Brand)——通过Instagram/TikTok/YouTube上的自有媒体内容先建立受众关系，再借助零售渠道进行分销。 注意力优先，内容优先，无需依赖平台也能主导市场。 中国的出海品牌，为什么基本上都是电商品牌的模式？ 不依赖平台的“内容优先”模式不香吗？ 冷静下来想想，跨文化背景获取注意力容易，还是精通平台规则容易？ 李子柒能文化输出，但是大多数中国人还是更擅长钻研规则。 所以，我并不认为Anker和Hero的模式落伍了。 相反，我觉得，发现市场空白→ 开发产品→优化流量→ 通过平台效率实现规模化的传统电商模式，才是更适合绝大多数中国出海品牌的稳健打法。

Rodriguez—Shine Global Inc/; Dia Dipasupil—; Tony Ding—Icon Sportswire/; Dia Dipasupil—WireImage/; Eugene Gologursky—Variety/; Courtesy For most people across the globe, social media is a daily part of life. Billions of people interact with brands, stories, influencers, and other content across various platforms everyday. With the impact that this content carries for consumers, discussing positivity, inclusivity, and the role that brands play is essential. At the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity on Tuesday, TIME CEO Jessica Sibley hosted a roundtable talk with industry leaders to discuss what they are up to in a rapidly changing online environment. The discussions began when CEO Bill Ready of Pinterest—which presented the event—brought up the challenges young people face today, and the importance of cultivating a healthy online platform. He recalls one decision he made to limit access to harmful content for those under 16. “As a parent, I truly believed I didn't want young people engaging with strangers online,” he said. Ready said that younger users have taken notice of Pinterest's overall approach as a platform where you can “get away from the toxicity elsewhere.” Others business leaders echoed similar concerns. Jim Steyer, founder and CEO of Common Sense Media, which reviews the safety of social media platforms, said that his biggest worry is that “we have waited a long time to deal with” the issue and that it's important to young people everywhere. “The same concerns we have in the U.S. are global,” he adds. Brieane Olson, CEO of retail company PacSun, says that businesses need to learn about the needs and wants of Gen Z users. “What has surprised me the most is how misunderstood Gen Z has become through the digital lens,” she said. “As adults in the room,” added Sadé Mohammed, the Chief Impact and Marketing Officer at TIME, “there's a feeling of not being included in real life. I think about what we can do to facilitate that community in person instead.” Some executives also highlighted the needs of specific younger audiences. Laurie Lam, Chief Brand Officer at e.l.f. Beauty, a cosmetics firm in California, said more companies need to focus on making young women feel seen and heard. “As a mom to two girls, our ethos is so rooted in lifting [up] others,” she said. For her part, Ndidi Oteh, incoming CEO of Accenture Song, a creative agency, raised the question of brand accountability. “It's a reoccurring theme, how do you hold your influencers accountable, how do you make sure that you act with responsibility … to make sure that we're actually moving towards a more positive world.” Industry leaders at the roundtable in Cannes also shed light on their own personal challenges. Erin Andrews, a sports broadcaster and co-founder of women's apparel company WEAR, revealed her experiences in the spotlight. Over time, she said, she found herself more open about her private life, including her treatment for cervical cancer. ""It was really difficult,"" she said. Andrews continues to stay motivated about getting female fans to attend games. “It brings tears to my eyes when dad's come up to me and say 'I want my daughter to do what you do',” she said.

明星美妆品牌，怎么就开始席卷欧美市场了？ 今年五月底，海莉·比伯（Hailey Bieber）的彩妆及护肤品牌Rhode以10亿美元的价格出售给了e.l.f. beauty，成为近年来规模最大的名人美妆收购案。 这也让这位28岁的美国模特进入了华尔街的视野。 Rhode成立仅三周年，却数次成为欧美社交媒体上的时尚风向标，这不仅是因为创始人Hailey的明星身份，更是说明了欧美年轻一代消费者的审美和价值追求。 事实上，当下欧美彩妆市场正经历着深刻变革。 从行业数据来看，2025 年第一季度，美国大众美妆销售额同比增长 3%，大众渠道增速首次赶超高端线——消费者偏好正悄然转变。 与此同时，像Rhode这类由顶流明星打造的品牌遍地开花，蕾哈娜（Rihanna）的Fenty Beauty、赛琳娜・戈麦斯（Selena Gomez）的Rare Beauty等，都成功打造了风靡欧美的爆款产品。 但繁华背后亦有隐忧，不少明星美妆品牌在短暂辉煌后迅速“塌房”。 在这波明星品牌崛起与陨落交织的浪潮里，隐藏着怎样的商业逻辑？ 它们是营销噱头的昙花一现，还是真有契合市场的独到之处？ 本期节目，《硅谷101》有幸邀请到某国货彩妆品牌出海负责人宫一柳和前券商可选消费首席分析师、“远行者与碎冰匠”频道主理人Neko（江东猫草）。 《硅谷101》特约研究员Yiwen将与她们一同深度剖析欧美明星品牌背后的商业逻辑。 欢迎关注《硅谷101视频号》的音频栏目直接收听本期播客 。 如 果你喜欢我们的 节目，更推荐大家使用音频客户端来收听，《硅谷101 》已覆盖各大主流音频平台（渠道见文末），欢迎订阅！ 以下是这次对话内容的精选: 
01 
不同于护肤，彩妆复杂的SKU管理 
Yiwen：大家觉得彩妆品牌的SKU管理，为什么这么难？ Neko：从分析师角度看，彩妆行业非常反直觉。 尽管它天然与价值观、包容度相关，但SKU管理难度极大，二级市场普遍认为其难以预测。 我们原本认为底妆因色号与质地相对单一（如3-4个色号✖️2种质地），SKU管理应较简单，但Fenty基于人种与肤色包容度推出海量色号，将底妆复杂度提升至接近普通彩妆的水平。 国内市场似乎缺乏与之完全对应的品牌。 若从明星品牌角度勉强类比，或许只有范冰冰自创品牌Fan Beauty，但它主攻面膜与护肤，非以彩妆为主。 国内以个人IP创业的彩妆品牌，较常被提及的有已上市的毛戈平，以及珀莱雅投资并控股的唐毅品牌彩棠。 来源：pixabay 
国内市场的风险偏好整体低于美国分析师或从业者。 品牌倾向于控制色彩、色号数量及SKU总量，使得库存周转长期维持在相对稳健的位置上。 彩妆品类长期盈利困难，包括资生堂在内的许多品牌均承认色彩类产品不赚钱。 因此，二级市场在评估彩妆品类时，对一级市场品牌兴衰的红利期心存疑虑，更期待品牌上市后能长期保持稳健与可预期性。 尤其在国内，二级市场机构投资者倾向于“先学挨打再学打人”，希望品牌控制风险，做到SKU可控：哪怕有50个色号，也至少需要明确告知重点生产的是哪些色号，其余则视为品牌建设的成本。 Yiwen：Rare Beauty曾在疫情期间推出过48色粉底，甚至为此找了48位不同肤色的素人进行测试，说明对于欧美彩妆品牌而言，色彩丰富度可能是一个相当重要的目标。 宫一柳：一个常见误区是将彩妆（Cosmetics）与护肤（Skincare）混为一谈，统称“美妆”。 但它们的底层逻辑截然不同：彩妆极度偏向时尚，以多SKU、多上新、多进度变化为特点，对库存管理和时尚敏感度的要求极高；对消费者而言，属于低客单价、低决策门槛、低复购率的品类，消费驱动力多为冲动购物与时尚跟风。 而底妆类产品（如粉底液）则更接近护肤，具有高复购、长周期的特点，部分护肤品的单一SKU甚至能维持十年的生命周期。 因此，彩妆行业极度关注当下流行元素、色系，并常有季节性设计。 既然底妆的色号管理本就麻烦，为什么现在的欧美彩妆品牌普遍强调多色号？ 部分因为Fenty Beauty开创了肤色包容度的新认知，契合了欧美社会对包容度（Inclusivity，或称DEI）的高度强调，Z世代消费者将包容度视为品牌文化认同的标尺。 以卡戴珊的SKIMS为例，它是极具研究价值的明星服饰品牌。 除了创始人卡戴珊塑造的“曲线”（Curvy）审美外，其能火的关键还在于尺码的极致包容。 同一件衣服能提供从XXS到XXL的广泛尺码，让几乎所有体型的人都能找到合适的、甚至让身材变得像卡戴珊一样好看的尺码。 这是一种强烈的包容度表达，也正是欧美泛年轻群体非常需要的价值主张。 02 
Z世代买单的不只产品，更是价值观
Yiwen：赛琳娜的Rare Beauty具体如何讲述价值观故事？ 因为彩妆最终卖的还是产品，但它在营销上花了很多心思，去打造“重视身心健康”的理念。 宫一柳：我认为Rare Beauty是从多方面持续传递和表达这一理念。 “品牌”的核心不在于一次线上活动或明星代言，而在于持之以恒地、用高质量内容重复表达同一主题。 这种“重复”和“高质量”至关重要，同时“一致性”也很关键。 Rare Beauty官网写道，它致力于用社会影响力改变世界 
来源：Rare Beauty 
比如，赛琳娜是一个很早就进入好莱坞，并且从十几岁到三十多岁一直在好莱坞工作的童星。 对于一个影响力如此大的名人来说，她从自有品牌创立的第一天起，就以非常坦诚的态度，和所有观众分享她在最脆弱的时刻和严重疾病斗争的经验——她曾患有红斑狼疮、肾病，也多次与双向情感障碍抗争。 这些故事对美国乃至全球流行文化受众都具有代表性和感染力。 而且我们要关注到，这一品牌推出时间基本上是在疫情期间——当时大家的心理状态更加脆弱，更加希望能够在线上有各种情感上的互相支持。 这也是欧美近年来的一个主流趋势，明星们愿意揭开脆弱面——不是随时随地都光鲜亮丽，而是有很多挣扎时刻，并希望通过分享这些经历来激励他人。 Rare Beauty从一开始传递的就不是“用彩妆变美”，而是关爱自身健康、分享爱、拥有更多能量，从而身心更加健康、由内而外散发光芒。 这种理念从第一天起就植入品牌表达，比如它体现在产品色号命名上，如Hope（希望）、Joy（快乐）——这种积极正向、一听就让人开心的名字，而不是根据颜色的传统命名方式。 赛琳娜本人对品牌非常投入，花了大量时间精力真正与用户沟通交流，这些活动更多是社区链接而非单纯卖货。..."

This press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250618288156/en/ In a culture of always-on content and constant pressure to perform, Sunnie offers space to slow down, reflect, and connect. Online and offline, Sunnie is building a community rooted in joy, curiosity, and real self-expression. This isn't just a brand. It's a movement for showing up fully—and living on your own terms. From Reese's Book Club and Shine Away to its wide range of film, TV, and audio projects, Hello Sunshine has a proven track record of creating women-centered content and experiences that resonate deeply with audiences. With Sunnie, Hello Sunshine expands its mission to change the narrative for women by investing in the next generation. The platform will feature social content, experiential events, book clubs, digital zines, custom curriculums, and more – all designed specifically with and for Gen Z girls. “It's been a dream of mine to build a space where young women can be the truest version of themselves,” said Reese Witherspoon, Founder of Hello Sunshine. “We've discovered that young women are not defined by doom and gloom as they're often portrayed in media – they're complex, creative individuals with incredible agency. Sunnie will be a celebration of that spirit, giving them the tools and community to navigate life's challenges while embracing their authentic selves.” Sunnie will feature collaborations with beloved Gen Z creators and celebrities, including Lana Condor and Hello Sunshine Collective talent like Molly Carlson and Raegan Revord to offer unexpected takes on all of life's big questions – from confidence and creative outlets to culture-driving trends, like fashion, entertainment, sports, STEM, and mental health. Sunnie has formed strategic alliances with mission-aligned organizations, including AnitaB.org, Child Mind Institute, Être, Lyda Hill Philanthropies' IF/THEN Initiative, Step Up, the Women's Sports Foundation, and Purdue University as the official University Partner. To ground the platform in real insights, Hello Sunshine also partnered with Être and YPulse to commission a national research report — The Gen Z Rewrite — surveying 1,000 girls ages 13–18 while establishing the Sunnie Gen Z Advisory Board. “Young women – despite the many pressures they face – are intentionally creating space for joy,” said Maureen Polo, Head of Direct to Consumer at Hello Sunshine. “They're writing their own stories, setting boundaries, finding community, and embracing both digital and real-world connections on their terms. And yet, 75% say advertising rarely reflects how they actually talk, dress, or act — a clear signal that the industry still isn't truly seeing them. Sunnie will support and amplify these efforts, providing content, curriculum, and experiences that resonate with how they actually live their lives, not how adults assume they do.” More than just a content platform, Sunnie represents Hello Sunshine's commitment to supporting both Gen Z girls and their caregivers. While Sunnie provides a community for young women, Hello Sunshine will simultaneously offer resources for parents to navigate the complexities of raising young people in today's world. Sunnie is proud to launch with e.l.f. Beauty as its foundational partner – bringing two brands together to create impact for the next generation through groundbreaking storytelling and experiences. Sunnie will come to life on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Pinterest. For more information about Sunnie and Hello Sunshine's mission to empower the next generation, visit www.wearesunnie.com. About Hello Sunshine Founded by Reese Witherspoon, Hello Sunshine puts women at the center of every story it creates, celebrates and discovers. Hello Sunshine tells stories across all platforms – from scripted and unscripted television, feature films, animated series, podcasts, audio storytelling, and digital series – all shining a light on where women are now and helping them chart a new path forward. Hello Sunshine is also home to Reese's Book Club. Fast growing in reach and influence, this community is propelled by meaningful connections with stories, authors, and fellow members.

mov_30731CE786C48E318308BD67A86F30CA,2025-06-18 10:19:57,en,WEB,"  LOS ANGELES--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hello Sunshine, a part of Candle Media, announced today the launch of Sunnie, a bold Gen Z-focused media, experiential and lifestyle brand, designed to inspire the next generation of young women to reclaim their time, follow their curiosity and step into their power— without the pressure of having it all figured out. In a culture of always-on content and constant pressure to perform, Sunnie offers space to slow down, reflect, and connect. Online and offline, Sunnie is building a community rooted in joy, curiosity, and real self-expression. This isn't just a brand. It's a movement for showing up fully—and living on your own terms. From Reese's Book Club and Shine Away to its wide range of film, TV, and audio projects, Hello Sunshine has a proven track record of creating women-centered content and experiences that resonate deeply with audiences. With Sunnie, Hello Sunshine expands its mission to change the narrative for women by investing in the next generation. The platform will feature social content, experiential events, book clubs, digital zines, custom curriculums, and more – all designed specifically with and for Gen Z girls. “It's been a dream of mine to build a space where young women can be the truest version of themselves,” said Reese Witherspoon, Founder of Hello Sunshine. “We've discovered that young women are not defined by doom and gloom as they're often portrayed in media – they're complex, creative individuals with incredible agency. Sunnie will be a celebration of that spirit, giving them the tools and community to navigate life's challenges while embracing their authentic selves.” Sunnie will feature collaborations with beloved Gen Z creators and celebrities, including Lana Condor and Hello Sunshine Collective talent like Molly Carlson and Raegan Revord to offer unexpected takes on all of life's big questions – from confidence and creative outlets to culture-driving trends, like fashion, entertainment, sports, STEM, and mental health. Sunnie has formed strategic alliances with mission-aligned organizations, including AnitaB.org, Child Mind Institute, Être, Lyda Hill Philanthropies' IF/THEN Initiative, Step Up, the Women's Sports Foundation, and Purdue University as the official University Partner. To ground the platform in real insights, Hello Sunshine also partnered with Être and YPulse to commission a national research report — The Gen Z Rewrite— surveying 1,000 girls ages 13–18 while establishing the Sunnie Gen Z Advisory Board. “Young women – despite the many pressures they face – are intentionally creating space for joy,” said Maureen Polo, Head of Direct to Consumer at Hello Sunshine. “They're writing their own stories, setting boundaries, finding community, and embracing both digital and real-world connections on their terms. And yet, 75% say advertising rarely reflects how they actually talk, dress, or act — a clear signal that the industry still isn't truly seeing them. Sunnie will support and amplify these efforts, providing content, curriculum, and experiences that resonate with how they actually live their lives, not how adults assume they do.” More than just a content platform, Sunnie represents Hello Sunshine's commitment to supporting both Gen Z girls and their caregivers. While Sunnie provides a community for young women, Hello Sunshine will simultaneously offer resources for parents to navigate the complexities of raising young people in today's world. Sunnie is proud to launch with e.l.f. Beauty as its foundational partner – bringing two brands together to create impact for the next generation through groundbreaking storytelling and experiences. Sunnie will come to life on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Pinterest. For more information about Sunnie and Hello Sunshine's mission to empower the next generation, visit www.wearesunnie.com.

80549c27cf5e35221ed05419b3df6ef4,2025-06-18 13:32:00,en,WEB,"  Reese Witherspoon, actor, and founder, Hello Sunshine, announced the launch of Sunnie, a brand to reach out to Gen Z on day three of the Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity. Witherspoon was in discussion with Kory Marchisotto, chief marketing officer, e.l.f. Beauty. Before she revealed the launch of Sunnie, she spoke about why she launched Hello Sunshine seven years ago. “Back in 2011, I was reading a script that came in for me. I was an actor for 20 years and had done a lot of comedies and dramas. But I was reading scripts that were demoralising and borderline misogynist. In one script a guy was joking about the girl's breasts. I didn't want to be part of it and certainly didn't want my daughter to see it. My manager told me how every female lead wanted this role. That's when I figured that when women aren't part of the creation process, such scripts come about,” she said. “I complained about it. But my mother taught me complaining is no good, and one must look to find solutions. And that's what I did. I was looking to auction books and turn them into movies. The first two were Wild and Gone Girl. We went on to shoot more films. I saw the power of partnership when we worked with Nicole Kidman and then with Jennifer Aniston,” she said before stating that partnerships are imperative for her as '1+1 can sum up to 5 and not 2' when they work. She also stated that Hello Sunshine puts women at the centre and doesn't create, big premium movies, but connects to audiences through every possible touch point. After the films, the next step of Hello Sunshine was to partner with brands. She explained, “We help create premium content to connect with audiences to create through real, authentic content. That's been fun and rewarding parts of Hello Sunshine.” She also spoke about how some portray social media to be negative, but she thinks of it as the contrary. “You would be hard-pressed to find that an actor who started in the 90s not feeling ignored or objectified. The media told people what to think of us. So, when social platforms came – they allowed us to write our own lives. Hello Sunshine has given women the chance to tell their stories in their worlds. There's so much negative around social media, but it's helped us create an online community into the real world offline,” she added. The duo then spoke about e.l.f's 'Too Many Dicks' campaign. “It's a similar story to Reese, where I was solving an issue for my younger self. I was too belittled in corporate America. I was treated as a second-class citizen. I wanted to do this for other women. Of the 4,100 publicly traded companies – only one company stood out in terms of representation which had 78% women and 44% diverse, and that was e.l.f,” explained Marchisotto. She added, “Women and diverse voices needed to be in the highest seat of power. We found out that there were more people named Dick and Richards than women on the board of directors of these companies and that became our campaign.” Witherspoon then revealed the launch of Sunnie. “Hello Sunshine has been around for seven years now. Now, I want to take the ideology and research to the younger generations and reach them. Sunnie has an advisory board of teenage girls. They are athletes, from STEM, from fashion, and AI,” she stated. The talk ended with Witherspoon sharing a piece of advice for creatives and marketers to reach the next generation. “Listen and watch people around you like family members. Watch their behaviour and where it's going,” she said."

The more I use it, the more I realize I don't like matte setting spray, so I'll repurchase it once it's done.) ✅ 32. ~~An eyeshadow - Glamshop Laser - 5/3.

I'll get a darker shade once I finish it. ~~ ✅ 16. ~~Something cool-toned - SEPHORA COLLECTION's About That Shine Sheer Shine Lipstick in Blinding Pink - 5/5 - I still find it too bright for an everyday look but it's easy to layer other products on top to tone down the color. ~~ ✅ 78. ~~A limited edition or discontinued product - Blend Bunny Forget Me Not palette - 10/10 - I fell in love again off this palette. I know it's one of the unpopular releases but I'm so glad I got my hands on it. I can use it for a wash of color on the eyes with the shimmer, for mapping the outline and fill in my brows, add warmth or cool to my face. ~~ **Ongoing:** ☑️ 34. A bronzer - e.l.f.

A jar of E.l.f. poreless primer putty so you can kiss your pores buh-bye! This primer will help you get a super smooth canvas to put your foundation on and will have you looking like your makeup was professionally airbrushed while helping to keep your beat in place. Say sayonara to your oily makeup looks and say heyyyy to a matte look. Promising reviews: ""Highly recommend. I learned about it because several influencers use it on TikTok. Tried it and it's my favorite, better than all the expensive brands I've tried before. Smooth application and does an excellent job! Excellent."" —Binnyx1 ""WOW!!!! I've been looking for a pore-filling primer for some time now — I am very, very picky and usually try to use super lightweight primers because my skin is sensitive, so I was a tad bit skeptical of this because it looks so thick in the package photos. However, I'm a BELIEVER now, y'all. It's much less thick than it looks and spreads super easy and evenly. My pores are getting smaller thanks to a new skincare routine, but I've been SO frustrated trying to find a primer that will actually conceal my pores so they don't completely suck up the foundation and make me look awful. This. Is. IT! I wear the primer with Missha BB cream cushion foundation, usually I don't go for super heavy coverage because of said pores but I was able to build to a fuller coverage than what I normally would, and my skin looks smooth and moisturized. Of course if you get super up close pores are still visible but MUCH less so than they are with other primers. You can't beat this for the price. I've even tried the Maybelline Baby Skin pore filler primer and this blows it out of the water. Can't beat it, especially for the price!!!!"" —Jody Ferguson Get it from Amazon for $10. 2.

Promising reviews: ""My hair had so much breakage from coloring it so much over the years and I was on the verge of completely shaving it. I saw one of God's favorites on TikTok with the hair of a goddess suggest this stuff. All I can say is wow! This cream must have been dropped from Heaven because it has saved my fried hair. Worth every penny, with this stuff, you too can be one of God's favorites."" —Kirstin ""I have used this product three times so far and have noticed a significant difference in my hair. I had my hair colored and experienced dryness and breakage. This product was recommended by a YouTuber so I gave it a try and am pleased. Initially, I used it every three to four days and will now use every seven days. I feel this product has made a huge difference with shedding, tangles, dryness, and breakage.

urn:li:ugcPost:7341567506249105409,2025-06-19 20:48:13,en,LINKEDIN,"  Each day at #CannesLions seems to outdo the last — and Day 3 delivered a masterclass in how #brands #creators and cultural leaders are shaping the future while staying deeply connected to their roots. ✨ During ""Evolving Your Brand Through the Ages"" at #AmazonPort #AndersonPaak, 9× #GRAMMY Award-winning artist, producer, director, and philanthropist, lit up the stage with his unique perspective on #culture and creativity: a storied past doesn't guarantee future relevance. To grow and stay meaningful, brands must build authentic, cross-generational connections. The real magic happens when heritage meets innovation — and the best brands prove that age really is just a number. #SarahIooss, Head of US Agency Development at Amazon Ads Agency, and #KathleenDunlop, Chief Marketing Officer for Beauty and Wellbeing at Unilever North America, shared sharp insights from the frontlines of global brand building. #ChrisGraves, Chief Creative Officer of Team One — Publicis Groupe's premium branding agency — brought a visionary take on storytelling at the highest level. #ReeseWitherspoon took the stage to introduce Hello Sunshine 's latest initiative — a platform built by and for the next generation of creators. Alongside #KoryMarchisotto (CMO, E.L.F. BEAUTY), they explored how #GenZ, despite the pressures they face, is reclaiming joy as a powerful, rebellious act. A moving reminder that storytelling is how culture evolves — and Gen Z is holding the pen. ""The #LateNight Hustle"" was all charm, power, and brilliance. #JimmyFallon, NBC's The Tonight Show host, Bozoma Saint John, a #marketing titan, and #SavannahGuthrie, Co-Anchor of #TODAY and NBC News Chief Legal Correspondent, unpacked the magic of turning entertainment into empire. From late-night laughs to full-scale brand #partnerships, their session was a dynamic look at how storytelling drives business, builds influence, and creates global resonance. I was blown away by Bozoma, a marketing powerhouse, #author, and #entrepreneur whose brilliant career has represented some of America's biggest brands, including Netflix, Endeavor, Uber, PepsiCo., and Apple music & iTunes. #Forbes named her the World's Most Influential #CMO and she even has a #Harvard Business School case study written about her illustrious career — a true force in every sense. As the sun started to dip, the evening rolled into two happy hours — one hosted by Amazon and another for all Cannes Lions delegates at the Palais des Festivals et des Congrès de Cannes. A perfect opportunity to (re)connect, decompress, and keep conversations flowing. The night ended on a high note at the Ad Age Cannes #LawnParty at Mondrian Cannes, a vibrant showcase of global #creativetalent. This year's #YoungCreatives Contest (in partnership with Zappi) spotlighted the rising stars who are already shaping what's next in the industry. Can't wait to see what comes next!"
mov_41ACAA9F7ECBC0B878CADA8B7CE3181C,2025-06-19 22:01:03,en,WEB,"  If Lululemon leggings, Olaplex hair products, and designer bags are on your wish list this year, these cheaper alternatives are about to make alllllll those wishes come true. 1. E.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter that looked at the iconic (and expensive) Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Filter and said, ""Game on, pal."" Not only does this give that dewy, soft, ""barely there"" finish, but it's designed to hydrate your skin with hyaluronic acid, helping improve your moisture barrier for longterm glowiness, too. Promising reviews: ""This stuff is so legit I've gone through three bottles. Adds the perfect glow to your skin! Sometimes I use it under foundation and sometimes I use it solo with a bit of concealer. I will never not repurchase it for the price and how beautifully it sits on the skin. This stuff is viral for a reason!!"" —mapagill ""If you like Charlotte Tilbury, flawless filter this is leaps and bounds better! Just buy it. The coverage is better, [it] makes my skin have the most amazing natural glow! The colors run with a more warm/yellow undertone which worked great for me! Spend a fraction of the price and just get it, you will be happy you did!"" —Amazonreview Get it from Amazon for $8.75+ (available in 15 shades). 2. Catrice ""Instant Awake"" Under Eye Brightener, which will be your holy grail for concealing and brightening dark circles under your eyes when your schedule is throwing you for a loop. This lightweight, color-adapting formula is designed for truly ~invisible~ coverage that makes a drastic difference — one that a lot of reviewers compare to the $33 Becca version. The color-adaptive formula is designed so one of two shades will work on any skin tone. Promising review: ""Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it."" —Monica T. Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades). 3. E.l.f.'s Hydrating Core Lip Shine in the ""Ecstatic"" shade, which reviewers say captures the some magic as ""Black Honey,"" the $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique that's blowing up on TikTok at a fraction of the price. It doesn't shift colors as magically as the other version, but it's a perfect, nonsticky ""go-to"" lip to keep in all your favorite bags. I personally will live, breathe, and die by the magic of $25 ""universal"" Black Honey version — it lasts FOREVER and also functions as the perfect blush — but it sells out so often that I am also deeply relieved to know it has a cheap alternative in case of lip emergency! Promising review: ""I absolutely love this product. The dark color is perfectly sheer. It also adds the most beautiful color to your lips. I am a Clinique Black Honey lip fan, and this gives me the same look for a fraction of the cost. I love it and have several that I keep in various spots. Not sticky either, which is my biggest gripe about lip glosses. My hair doesn't get stuck in this like some glosses, but I get the shine."" —Hamps5 Get it from Amazon for $6.95+ (also available in six other shades). 4. And Moodmatcher color-changing lipstick, an affordable WinkyLux alternative that not only adapts to the pH of your skin to create a personalized, perfect shade for your skin tone, but lasts for HOURS. Reviewers marvel at its all-day staying power even after meals and breaking a sweat. Look at that lil' green lipstick go!! Moodmatcher is a small business that specializes in color-changing lipstick. Promising review: ""This color is beautiful, and shows up differently on everyone. This thing that I like most about this product, is that it stays on all day even through eating several meals. I have to use a microfiber cloth to remove it at night!""..."

mov_9FC4EEBEF59D382311B1634CD78C5E81,2025-06-20 06:23:32,en,WEB,"  Bride Hard wants to be a Paul Feig movie so bad. Known for his female-led comedies in the late 2000s and 2010s, Feig is known for his acute ability to combine humor, pathos, and action to move the story along in memorable and hilarious ways. The essence of his best, such as The Heat, Spy, and of course Bridesmaids, make up the DNA of Bride Hard without any of the tact and care that those films are known for. Instead of a smart and funny commentary on female friendship, it's a cliché, harshly written money grab that gives female-led casts a bad name. Rebel Wilson and Anna Camp, known for their work on Pitch Perfect together, reunite as two lifelong friends who face a crossroads in their relationship. Camp plays Betsy, a thirty-something bride who is very excited to get married to the wealthy Ryan (Sam Huntington). She harbours resentment and frustration towards her best friend Sam (Wilson), who is married to her job. Sam also happens to be a government asset. This is sort of where the story goes off the rails. After ditching Betsy and the rest of the bridal party in Paris for a mission and subsequently getting demoted from Maid-of-Honor, Sam attends the wedding on Ryan's family's island. Not only is her relationship with Betsy icy, but she is getting left out by the rest of the bridal party, including Ryan's controlling sister, Virginia (Anna Chlumsky), and Betsy's college roommates, Lydia (Da'Vine Joy Randolph) and Zoe (Gigi Zumbado). When the ceremony is crashed by a dangerous cartel member (Stephen Doff), Sam and Betsy must put everything aside to save the day. To say this script is a hodge-podge of cliches and plot devices would be an understatement. Nothing is really developed; every line feels flimsy. There are no emotional stakes. The stars director Simon West brings together give wooden and goofy performances. Rebel Wilson lacks the comedic precision and believability to be a secret agent. She is no Melissa McCarthy, who gives an underrated performance in Spy. Anna Camp plays the damsel in distress best friend as obnoxiously over-the-top as possible. Every reaction is overdrawn. At one point, she comes bounding into the room as if she is on Lassie, screaming about how her friend is really alive. The tone, the cadence, everything— very Lassie-like. The characters may be written as caricatures, but Camp's one-note performance doesn't do the film any favors. There are so many elements of this film that are just off. From the blatant product placement for Lay's, Sun Chips, and E.L.F. cosmetics to the awkward pacing, there's so much that doesn't work in Bride Hard. The action scenes were long and boring. I felt myself falling asleep during one at the end. It is also worth mentioning that Sam's family owns a centuries-old distillery in Savannah that is not not a plantation. Like, they have cannons on the property but don't mention its history at all. The whole thing is weird. The best part of Bride Hard is Da'Vine Joy Randolph. She is witty and beautiful and not in the film enough. When she is, she's in a completely different movie, a better movie I can stand watching. She deserves better. Women in general deserve better. Bride Hard is in theaters today. Watch the trailer below. [embedded content]"

But behind the glamour and headlines lies a story you haven't heard: that of Indian-American dermatologist Dr. Dhaval Bhanusali. A founding team member, formulator, and early believer in Rhode, Dr. Bhanusali played a pivotal role in turning a skincare startup into a billion-dollar brand. In this episode of ET Conversation, Nisha Poddar speaks with Dr. Bhanusali about building Rhode from scratch, the science behind its products, the rising influence of Indian beauty traditions like turmeric and hair oiling, and his personal journey as an immigrant son balancing medicine, entrepreneurship, and global ambition.

Let's look at 10 monster growth stocks to buy for the long haul. Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocksto buy right now. Continue 1. Nvidia Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has been one of the market's biggest winners, as its  graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the backbone of artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure. That should continue as its CUDA software program has created a wide moat, helping it attain a 92% market share in the GPU space in the first quarter. With AI infrastructure demand continuing to rise, Nvidia is well-positioned for years of continued growth. Biggest risk: A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending. Image source: Getty Images. 2. Broadcom While Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is seeing strong growth from its networking portfolio, its biggest opportunity lies in helping customers develop custom AI chips. It projects that its three furthest along customers in this area will be a $60 billion to $90 billion market opportunity in fiscal 2027 alone. Meanwhile, it has added other big customers since then, including Apple. Biggest risk: A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending. 3. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) is the world's leading contract semiconductor manufacturer, producing chips for companies like Nvidia and Broadcom. Its technological expertise and scale have made it an invaluable part of the semiconductor value chain, allowing it to increase prices and expand margins. As AI infrastructure spending and other chip consumption grows, TSMC is set to be one of the biggest winners in the years ahead. Biggest risks: A slowdown in AI infrastructure spending and/or Intel being a more viable competitor. 4. Palantir Technologies Originally a data-gathering and analytics company serving the U.S government, Palantir Technologies' (NASDAQ: PLTR) AI platform (AIP) has been gaining strong momentum in the U.S. commercial sector. The platform helps organizations gather data from a variety of sources and organize it into an ""ontology"" that connects the data to real-world assets and processes. This allows its customers to then use AI to solve complex, real-world problems. AIP is being used in a wide array of industries, which gives Palantir a huge growth runway ahead. Biggest risks: A high valuation and budget cuts at the U.S. government. 5. Alphabet Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) is not only a leader in search, but it's seeing strong growth in its  cloud computing and robotaxi businesses as well. Meanwhile, as the world moves toward AI-powered search, the company has huge distribution and ad network advantages. Alphabet's AI capabilities and ability to monetize content also should not be underestimated. While some see AI as a risk, more likely than not, it will be a growth driver for the company in the coming years. Biggest risks: AI disrupts its search business and harsh penalties from its antitrust trial. 6. Amazon Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is the market leader in both e-commerce and cloud computing. AWS continues to be its biggest growth driver, and the company is investing heavily in the business to capture the AI opportunity in front of it. At the same time, it's using AI to drive efficiencies and lower costs in its e-commerce operations, helping boost profitability. Biggest risks: A slowdown in consumer spending and overbuilding its data center infrastructure. 7. Pinterest Under the leadership of CEO Bill Ready, Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) has spent the last few years investing heavily to help transform its platform into one that is both more engaging and shoppable. Some of the newest features that have been rolled out to help support this vision are visual search and personalized recommendations. This has helped Pinterest not only grow its users, but more importantly, to start better monetizing them. Meanwhile, its new Performance+ solution, which integrates AI tools and automation to help advertisers run better campaigns, is expected to be a growth driver moving forward...."

Our beauty team has curated a list of the top viral beauty trends that are not only buzzworthy but also totally wearable. Whether you're on the hunt for your new beauty staple or seeking some inspo for your next trip to the hair or nail salon, here's what's hot right now... READ MORE: Skincare guru Caroline Hirons on the two products every teen should use – and what to avoid READ MORE: 'I've tried dozens of foundations but this one always gets me compliments' 10 biggest beauty trends for summer 2025 Mocha bronde The Princess of Wales, Rita Ora and Lisa have all been sporting a mocha bronde hair colour recently (Image: Getty, Instagram @ritaora) Pantone's Colour of the Year, Mocha Mousse, is making waves in the hair world too, and mocha bronde is the it-shade for summer, according to hair stylist and trend guru Tom Smith. He describes it as ""monochromatic and muted"", reports the Mirror. At the salon, don't just ask for any brown – specify mushroom and coffee tones with no caramel highlights, says Tom. To maintain the colour, treat your locks bi-weekly with a blue or purple shampoo, like John Frieda Blue Crush Blue Conditioner, curerntly £6.89. Tubing mascara Tubing mascara might be the answer if you find your regular formula always smudges (Image: Too Faced, Revolution) Struggling with panda eyes in the summer heat, or while you swim? Make a switch to tubing mascara. Forget the messy smudges of old-school mascaras – these use polymers to wrap each lash in a smudge-free 'tube', offering length and a firm hold. The best part? They're a dream to remove. Just a bit of warm water and a gentle rub, and they'll slip right off, particularly great for those with sensitive eyes. Too Faced Ribbon Wrapped Lash Mascara , £28 – check out my full review of this mascara here Revolution Wrap Lash Tubing Mascara , currently priced at £7.99 (usual price £10.99) Popular Korean beauty brand Belif has just launched into the UK (Image: Marie Francesca Photography) Korean beauty isn't a new trend, but with the recent UK launch of popular K-beauty brands like Beauty of Joseon at Boots and Belif on Beauty Bay and Amazon, it's now easier than ever to give them a go. Korean formulas are renowned for their hydrating properties and dewy finish, yet they're incredibly lightweight, making them perfect for summer when slathering on heavy cream in hot weather might not be so appealing. SPF superstars Three of our favourite facial SPFs this summer (Image: Merit, Ultra Violette, Olay) Sunscreen is often viewed more as a necessity than a luxury, but facial SPF formulations have significantly improved – so there's really no reason not to wear it daily. Merit's The Uniform Tinted Mineral SPF 50, £34, launched with a waitlist of over 20,000, while beauty editors have been raving about Ultra Violette Future Fluid SPF 50+ Superlight Mineral Skinscreen, £38. Designed to be make-up-friendly, Olay Brighten and Glow Vitamin C Moisturising Fluid SPF 50+, £26, looks set to be the high street's top choice – and you can often find it on sale, too. Fruity fragrances Three gorgeous fruity fragrances to try this summer (Image: PHLUR, Ariana Grande, Jo Loves) Perfumes take their inspiration from fruits, with juicy concoctions creating dreamy scents. Try PHLUR Peach Skin Body Mist, from £25, Ariana Grande R.E. M. Cherry Eclipse Eau de Parfum, currently £36 (usual price £45), or Jo Loves With Love From Como, £135, with zesty notes of grapefruit and clementine. And look out for a lip-smacking new launch from Jo Malone London next month. Sunscreen oils Bali Body's new Watermelon Sunscreen Oil SPF 50 (Image: Bali Body) They're back – but with a big difference. Unlike the sometimes dangerously low (or even no) protection tanning oils of the past, Bali Body's new Watermelon Sunscreen Oil SPF 50, £22.95, comes with super-high broad spectrum sun protection for that gleaming-limb look without risking your skin. It smells incredible, too – like summer in a bottle. Neck care Two neck creams worth checking out (Image: Boost Lab, PRAI) In summer there's little chance to hide under high-neck jumpers, so if you're not already paying attention to the skin under your chin, you really should be, say the experts and – judging by all the new neck creams being launched and the interest we get from readers whenever we write about them – it's clearly an area worth paying attention to. Boost Lab's Edelweiss Neck Firming Serum, £24.99, is good value with impressive shopper results, while Prai Ageless Throat and Decolletage Creme, £31.99, continues to be the best-selling neck cream at M&S...."

mov_BB1DF183DDA37AC70BE04E5FA5294FAA,2025-06-22 17:31:01,en,WEB,"  This ""holy grail"" seamless underwear doesn't show, doesn't ride up, and is so affordable you'll stock up on a whole drawer full. 1. A set of DEET-free handy mosquito-repelling bracelets for the ultimate in genius summer investments — these use essential oils, including citronella, to help stop those teensy vampires in their tracks. Cliganic is a small business that specializes in all-natural personal care products. Check out a TikTok of the mosquito-repelling bracelets in action. Promising review: ""I moved last year from Southern California to North Carolina. Bugs of all types have always been attracted to me but the amount of bites I got last summer was WILD. Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and un-touched. Delivery was very quick so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hyper sensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive."" —Tracey Agopian Get a ten-pack from Amazon for $9.98 (also available in larger packs). 2. Gold Bond's firming neck and chest cream that your skin will be SO happy to soak up — this is formulated with aloe, salicylic acid, and jojoba oil to help hydrate, tighten, and gently exfoliate your skin so effectively that you should be able to see early results in two weeks. (For some reviewers, it only took a few days!) Check out a TikTok of Gold Bond in action. Promising review: ""This cream has tightened the skin around my neck beyond my expectations. I've been using daily (morning and evening) for over two months and still have product left. I've even tried it on my face and it gives me a bit of a 'face lift.' I'm officially a Bond girl. A bit sticky to the touch after a few hours of wear, but that doesn't bother me. Will order again."" —AP Wang Get it from Amazon for $11.97. 3. E.l.f's Lash XTNDR Tubing Mascara, a GODSEND for anyone with thin or fragile lashes. This uses lightweight ~tubing~ technology to wrap around lashes and give them a natural-looking, smudge-proof extension so good it almost looks fake. The real boon, though, is how easily the ""tubes"" slide off in clean, easy swipes at the end of the day when you're washing your face — absolutely no smudging, over-scrubbing, or special eye makeup removal products required. Check out a TikTok of the E.l.f. tubing mascara in action. I am not a new human to the tubing mascara game, and in fact readily spent $26 on the famous OG blend from Blinc every time it needed replacing. I didn't even love it for the length half as much as the fact that tubing mascara like this genuinely never smudges, but can I just say — regardless of price, the E.l.f. tubing mascara formula blows all the others I've tried out of the water. It gives me way more length and volume than other brands, slides on so much more easily, stays put ALL day, and never, ever smudges. My favorite part, though, is how gently and easily it comes off with soap and water. In the past, other mascara removals have felt rough on my lashes, but this comes off so fast that I'm like ??? was I even wearing mascara a minute ago?? Anyway, I hesitate even writing this review because I want to gatekeep the hell out of this before it sells out, but the world needed to know. I'm a big fan of the brown shade (which is what I'm wearing above!) , but it also comes in black and soft black. Get it from Amazon for $7 (available in three shades). 4. A set of Victoria's Secret–inspired seamless ""invisible"" underwear so soft and stretchy your butt will want to *sing* when you slide them on. This is a true holy grail underwear that doesn't show, doesn't ride up, and somehow manages to look cute all at the same time. Check out a TikTok of the seamless underwear in action. Promising review: ""These are my new favorite. They are comfortable and do not show under all my clothes. They are super soft too and hold up all day without gapping. I have been buying Victoria's Secret underwear for many years spending unnecessary money. I'll repurchase these over and over again.""..."

3d75f3b4fc3ab5f5bb22e10d8ecb5f06,2025-06-23 17:07:00,en,WEB,"  Sunnie, the new brand from Reese Witherspoon's Hello Sunshine, was born out of a desire to empower Gen Z girls. Sunnie is a multi-platform, Gen Z-focused brand that exists on social media, in real life, and through community-driven content. It plans to post on Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and Pinterest. The brand will also host events, release digital zines, and provide custom curriculum for teen girls and their caretakers covering topics from financial literacy to certificate programs. It's an extension of Hello Sunshine's original mission to put women at the center of every story. “It's designed to feel like a movement—joyful, collaborative, and intentionally different from the always-on, hyper-curated norms of traditional media,” Jennifer Wiener, the EVP of Solar, Hello Sunshine's in-house agency, told ADWEEK. Hello Sunshine saw a need and a white space for building a space for Gen Z girls. In addition to a lack of media aimed at Gen Z, Sunnie also hopes to help young women who don't feel represented by brands or the media. “Over the last few years, one of the fastest growing audience opportunities has been this youth audience,” said Wiener. Sunnie in part responds to a void of media and brands directed at teen girls in recent years. In the 1990s and aughts there were dozens of teen magazines addressing every aspect of teen life, but that era ended in 2018 when the final two, Seventeen and Rookie Mag, went out of print. Today, teen girls engage with culture and advertisers on social media, which can be a dangerous place for them. Sunnie is partly a response to an ask from Hello Sunshine's community of mothers looking for support and a better environment to raise their daughters in. “We are intentionally creating experiences that bring girls outside of the digital ecosystem and into environments that create slow spaces for them to explore, lean in, and deepen their engagement,” said Wiener. Sunnie wants to work with brands E.l.f. Cosmetics is Hello Sunshine's anchor partner for Sunnie. Last year, the beauty brand worked with Hello Sunshine to host Reese's Book Club within E.l.f.'s Roblox environment with Witherspoon's nieces, Abby James and Draper. The Hello Sunshine experience was E.l.f.'s best performing brand campaign on Roblox, said Kory Marchisotto, CMO of E.l.f. Cosmetics. The beauty brand also extended the campaign with Abby James and Draper to Twitch with more than 175,000 people tuning in. “Those signals are telling us that connecting these two worlds is incredibly powerful, and people are very interested in this intersection of beauty, culture, and entertainment,” said Marchisotto. Marchisotto told ADWEEK that a study Hello Sunshine ran shaped the brand's involvement with Sunnie. Seventy-six percent of Gen Z girls between the ages of 13 and 18 years old don't feel seen in today's media, Marchisotto said. In addition to E.l.f. Cosmetics, Sunnie has partnered with organizations like Être, Step Up, AnitaB.org, Women's Sports Foundation and the Child Mind Institute, as well as Purdue University. With women clothing brand Être, Sunnie has formed the Sunnie Gen Z Advisory Board. The board consists of 20 diverse teenage girls from across the country that range in age from 13 to 21. The board doubles as a mentorship program and girls were chosen based on their realness, curiosity, and willingness to speak honestly about what it means to grow up right now. Sunnie asks the board open questions and tests ideas, co-creates content, programming, and messaging with them. Sunnie wants to bring women into STEM Purdue is partnering with Sunnie to develop curriculum to inspire girls to pursue careers in STEM. While the programming is still in development, Kelly Hiller, Purdue's CMO told ADWEEK that Purdue is interested in launching a STEM workbook that makes different career paths accessible to teen girls by showing how their interests might match up with STEM careers. Purdue will also provide career development offerings to Sunnie's target audience's of caregivers. Eventually, Sunnie will include a landing page of certificate programs and STEM development aimed at caregivers. These certificates might include anything from Google Career certificates in topics like project management and data analytics to pharmacy technician certificates. The partnership between Sunnie and Purdue aligns with Purdue's objective of bridging the gender gap in STEM, and it allows the university to reach its core-intended audience of prospective applicants, 13 to 17-year-olds. In partnership with Sunnie, Purdue will host more hands-on events to encourage interest in STEM careers. Sunnie reached out to Purdue after the university partnered with E.l.f. for an activation last year to spark girls' interest in STEM tied to Taylor Swift's Eras Tour shows in Indianapolis. The “STEM Era” event was open to the public and featured activities like making friendship bracelets using binary code and designing social media backgrounds using computer graphics technology. It drew 10,000 attendees. “We're going to work with Sunnie to help develop their STEM curriculum for young women, as well as making courses and professional development opportunities available to their caregivers,” Kelly Hiller, Purdue's CMO told ADWEEK."

mov_678D557B9B18A105B589B04DEF1B1194,2025-06-23 18:30:00,en,WEB,"  Personalizing a divisive political issue at the same time the U.S. Supreme Court upheld aggressive state-level legislation that bans gender-affirming care for minors, “Just Kids” invites audiences to get two know three teenagers trying to live in harmony while feeling like they do not belong in their own bodies. The documentary's format may be conventional — featuring camera-facing talking heads and interviews with the central trio and their families — but it still makes a powerful, humanizing case for those impacted by the decision. The film is credited to the Toboni sisters, Gianna (who directed) and Jacqueline (one of its producers). Their script, co-written with Samantha Wender, identifies the 2015 Supreme Court decision to legalize same sex marriage as the spark that brought together the Christian right-wing political machine to deny trans people the medical care they seek. As experts, civil rights activists and medical professionals explain, gender-affirming care became the target of an ideological legislation war after that major milestone. 'Miss Congeniality' Actress Heather Burns 'Would Jump' at Making a Third Film and Working With 'Lifelong Friends' Like Sandra Bullock: 'That Was One of the Best Experiences of My Life' Ellen Pompeo Supports 'No Kings' Protests and Mocks Trump's 'Low Emotional Intelligence and Ego': 'How Long Is the Hard-on Going to Last?' Beauty Brand E.l.f Sets Roast-Style Comedy Special 'Sunhinged,' Featuring Meghan Trainor and 'RuPaul's Drag Race' Star Heidi N' Closet (EXCLUSIVE) The film's teenage protagonists represent a range of backgrounds and experiences. In South Carolina, the audience meets 15-year-old Joplin, who idolizes their gun-wielding veteran father. In Waco, Texas, there's 17-year-old Alazaiah, a bubbly and positive TikToker with sparkles in her hair. Elsewhere in Texas, the film showcases 14-year-Tristan, whose single mother desperately tries to make enough to take care of her two children. All three are shown to have full and thriving lives at school and at home. The film follows its subjects and their families as the teens take the preliminary steps in their transition journey. It's refreshing to see that each comes from a supportive home — a surprising but welcome contrast with so many queer narratives in which young people try to find acceptance from their kin and community. “Just Kids” makes a strong counterargument for those who seek to limit such teens' rights by privileging their perspectives, emphasizing how all they want is to live on their own terms. The historical, social and medical context sometimes comes in rather dry facts, but the protagonists' reactions make these details visceral. For example, the film shares that there are some 200,000 internal refugees within the United States, comprising the largest internal migration since the Dust Bowl era of the 1930s. These families had to leave their homes and move to states that accept their children. However, the film shows the toll of laws changing, medical care refused, bills piling up, threats from neighbors, abusive phone calls and hateful treatment from schoolmates. All of it becomes emotionally potent when seen through the subjects' eyes. A heartbreaking scene in which a doctor informs one of the kids via Zoom about how the new laws impact their treatment plays almost like a breakup and leaves a lasting impression. The doctor was prohibited from continuing to provide gender-affirming care, which meant they had to leave the patient's home state and can no longer provide medical assistance across state lines. As the kid's tear-filled face fills the frame, the tragic effect of these laws becomes palpably clear. Elsewhere, “Just Kids” shows evidence of injustice with the threat of Child Protective Services investigations hovering over these three loving families. Escape is the solution for some; fighting in court is the choice another family makes. After reaching that emotional apex about three quarters in, “Just Kids” can't offer anything on the same strong level in its last section. The film seems long, as if it's stuck in one spot, repetitively cycling through the same issues. Perhaps that's because the story is still unfolding and these young people are only now starting their lives. “Just Kids” covers just one year of time, after all. Still, it finds catharsis in showing them move forward, receiving and giving back love as they go. The film's tone remains hopeful, despite the adversity faced by its protagonists. “Just Kids” shows with clarity the effects of laws on the lives of young trans people. It questions, through the protagonists' testimony, what lawmakers mean when they say they seek to “protect the children.” In fact, as the film demonstrates by showing the disruption and chaos brought to these families, such efforts feel more like political posturing. The film might be modest in its cinematic ambitions, but its message aims to change minds and eventually lives. Best of Variety The Best Albums of the Decade Sign up for Variety's Newsletter.

一、核心财务表现：收入增长稳健，亏损持续收窄
2025年第一季度，Roblox营收同比增长29%至10.35亿美元，虽略低于市场预期的11.4亿美元，但连续四个季度保持28%以上的增速，显示平台增长动能稳固。 分业务来看，用户生成内容（UGC）生态仍是核心驱动力，创作者分成支出同比增长27%至2.816亿美元，印证平台对内容创作者的强吸引力。 净利润方面，公司净亏损同比收窄20.53%至2.16亿美元，主要得益于基础设施成本优化（同比下降50%）和运营效率提升。 现金流表现亮眼：运营现金流达2.07亿元人民币（约合2870万美元），自由现金流同比增长54%至1.206亿美元，反映业务规模扩张与资金回笼能力的增强。 二、用户增长与活跃度：DAU突破8500万，国际市场贡献显著
1. 用户规模持续扩张：
季度日均活跃用户（DAU）达8530万，同比增长19%，其中日本、印度等新兴市场DAU增速超50%，成为增长引擎。 月活跃用户（MAU）未单独披露，但结合历史数据及付费用户增长（平均每月付费用户2020万，同比+29%），平台整体用户粘性保持高位。 2. 用户付费意愿提升：
每DAU平均预订收入（ABPDAU）为12.34美元，同比增长4%，反映游戏内虚拟商品（如Avatar装扮、道具）和订阅服务（Roblox Premium）的变现能力增强。 此外，付费用户占比从去年同期的22%提升至23%，显示平台商业化策略成效。 三、战略布局与生态建设：AI赋能创作，创作者经济深化
1. AI驱动内容生产与发现：
公司推出Roblox助手等AI工具，支持开发者通过自然语言生成场景、优化代码。 例如，创作者可通过语音指令快速生成森林、路灯等3D元素，显著降低开发门槛。 同时，AI推荐算法优化用户内容发现效率，带动季度用户总时长增长15%至16.7亿小时。 2. 创作者生态持续繁荣：
2025年Q1，平台创作者收入达2.816亿美元，过去12个月超100名开发者收入超100万美元。 公司通过21%的流水分成比例（基于Bookings计算）和开发者基金支持创作者，并举办RNA大赛吸引280万创作者参与，进一步巩固UGC生态壁垒。 3. 国际化与商业化创新：
国际市场收入占比提升至36%，其中亚太地区贡献显著。 同时，与Google合作推出奖励视频广告，用户可通过观看30秒广告获取游戏内奖励，广告完成率超80%，为平台开辟新收入来源的同时，也为开发者提供额外分成。 四、风险与挑战：盈利压力与竞争加剧
1. 盈利能力待提升：
尽管亏损收窄，但非GAAP运营利润率仍为负（-21%），主要受AI研发、服务器成本及创作者分成支出拖累。 管理层预计2025年全年调整后EBITDA为2.275亿美元，较市场预期低78%，显示短期盈利压力较大。 2. 竞争环境加剧：
沙盒游戏市场中，《我的世界》以3亿销量稳居第一，而Roblox移动端收入从单月近亿降至3500万美元。 此外，Epic Games凭借《堡垒之夜》和虚幻引擎持续扩张，其2023年收入达56亿美元，DAU超2500万，对Roblox构成直接威胁。 3. 宏观经济与监管风险：
全球电子烟监管趋严（如雾芯科技面临非法产品冲击）可能间接影响用户消费意愿。 此外，苹果税（iOS内购抽成30%）仍占Roblox移动端收入的较大比例，尽管公司通过官网充值激励减少依赖，但短期内难以完全规避。 五、未来展望：元宇宙与成本优化双轮驱动
1. 元宇宙战略深化：
公司计划通过AI工具和3D内容生成技术，推动平台向元宇宙演进。 例如，AI生成头像工具已进入测试阶段，用户可通过上传照片快速生成个性化虚拟形象。 同时，与e.l.f. Beauty、亚马逊等品牌合作探索虚拟广告和电商场景，拓展商业化边界。 2. 成本控制与效率提升：
管理层表示将继续优化基础设施成本，目标2025年服务器和信任安全支出同比下降50%。 此外，通过引导用户绕过苹果税（如官网充值），预计毛利率可提升2-3个百分点。 3. 长期目标与估值：
Roblox计划在2030年前占据全球游戏市场10%份额（目前为2.4%）。 尽管当前估值较高（43倍EV/EBITDA），但其现金储备达162亿元人民币，且用户增长潜力（尤其是新兴市场）为长期投资提供支撑。 结论
2025年Q1，Roblox在用户增长、创作者生态和国际化布局上表现亮眼，AI工具的应用进一步巩固了其UGC平台的领先地位。 然而，盈利压力和竞争加剧仍是短期挑战。 若公司能有效控制成本、提升ARPU，并在元宇宙场景中实现突破，有望在中长期兑现增长潜力。 投资者需密切关注DAU增速、创作者分成效率及国际市场拓展进展。"

74EC39F1D1BD069992D168E8C7155F02,2025-06-24 21:57:51,en,PRINT,"  MUMBAI: When US-based model and entrepreneur Hailey Bieber reached an agreement in May to sell her skincare brand Rhode to e.l.f. Beauty for $1 billion, within just three years of founding, it added to the bulging roster of celebrity beauty brands hitting the big league. It also brightened the star of Dhaval Bhanusali, the Indian-American dermatologist behind the brand's formulations, who Martha Stewart, another celebrity he has partnered with, memorably called the 'Willy Wonka of derm"". Bhanusali, well known and celebrated in dermatology circles and a sought-after practitioner, says there's an ""Indian boom"" unfolding in the global beauty market. Commonly used Indian ingredients are finding their way into skincare potions lining department store shelves everywhere."" Amla and haldi may be ordinary kitchen essentials on Indian shelves that often double up for skin care routine, but that's exactly what is separating the country from western world when it comes to the global beauty market and its 'discovery' of natural ingredients,"" said Bhanusali.A mix of amla (Indian gooseberry), haldi (turmeric) have been ingredients in many Indian beauty products for generations.But he is referring not just to the use of traditional Indian beauty secrets by cosmetics companies, but also to the increasing muscle of India in the global cosmetic industry, both as a market and also because of the Indian or Indian-origin leaders in their corner offices.Tarang Amin, the CEO of e.l.f., is also an Indian-origin executive.Indians have also taken top jobs at global personal care companies. Leena Nair is the global CEO at luxury and beauty brand Chanel, while Priya Nair is the president of Unilever's beauty and wellbeing business.L'Oreal S.A. and Shiseido, two of the world's largest cosmetics companies, as well as consumer goods giants Unilever and Beiersdorf, the maker of Nivea, have all identified India as a key growth driver, citing the country's burgeoning population and growing affinity for beauty products. ""I hope it inspires the next generation of entrepreneurs and becomes something that is more and more prevalent,"" added Bhanusali, an Indian American born to Baroda-based Gujarati parents who migrated to the US five decades ago, referring to the deal.With influencers-turned-beauty gurus popularising products from cleansers and moisturisers to serums and lotions-with many claimed to be either made with natural ingredients or backed by dermatologists-Bhanusali, the New York-based founder of Hudson Dermatology and Laser, expects rise of Indians in positions of influence in the beauty world. ""My dream is to see an Indian company, go out to the world, as opposed to just coming into India. So maybe one day, but I think it is coming soon,"" added Bhanusali. ""India shifted so much in the last decade or so. It's really come a long way. I am hopeful that it's continuing to become a global powerhouse."" According to Redseer, India's beauty and personal care market is expected to reach $34 billion by 2028, driven by rising disposable incomes, deeper e-commerce penetration and growing consumer openness to new products.Globally as well as in India, celebrities and influencers have increasingly shifted from brand endorsements to part-financing consumer products firms or start their own brands and help influence sales.Bieber's reach of 54 million followers on Instagram helped propel Rhode to sales in excess of $200 million in less than three years after she founded it.In India, there are a host of global and digital-first beauty brands and labels, including those launched by celebrities such as Deepika Padukone, Katrina Kaif and Kriti Sanon.

In this article, we will summarize the bull's thesis on ELF. e.l.f. Beauty, Inc.'s share was trading at $121.87 as of June 24th. ELF's trailing and forward P/E ratios were 63.47 and 32.36, respectively, according to Yahoo Finance. A smiling woman applying a product from the company's skin care line. e.l.f. Beauty (ELF) has delivered impressive growth metrics over the past three years, with a 15.1% sales CAGR and a striking 33.9% GAAP EPS CAGR, suggesting accelerating operating leverage. With a market cap of $6.6 billion, the stock is being evaluated against EPS-based end multiples ranging from 15x to 35x. However, the market appears to be pricing in record-level EPS levels the company has yet to reach, implying investor expectations around improved scalability and operational efficiency. Intriguingly, while EPS projections drive most valuation models, the company's free cash flow per share significantly exceeds reported GAAP earnings, suggesting GAAP numbers may understate true economic performance. This discrepancy likely arises from the accounting treatment of intangibles-heavy investments, which depress near-term EPS but may fuel long-term value. Historical context shows that ELF shares may have bottomed recently, offering a potentially compelling entry point, especially given the relatively low sentiment and expectations already embedded in the stock price. This stands in contrast to other high-growth names that often trade at premium valuations. The core argument here is that while traditional EPS-based valuation may suggest ELF is priced for perfection, its robust free cash flow profile paints a different, more bullish picture. Over time, EPS is likely to converge upward with free cash flow as the benefits of past intangible investments materialize. This dynamic makes ELF a possible hidden gem for forward-looking investors who prioritize cash-based valuation metrics over conventional earnings, especially in an economy increasingly driven by intangible capital and innovation. Previously, we covered a bullish thesis on e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. by Fierce__beast in November 2024, which highlighted the company's strong fundamentals, strategic acquisitions, and expanding e-commerce and international presence. The company's stock price has depreciated by approximately 0.64% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as long-term drivers remain intact. Francesco Ferrari shares a similar view but emphasizes free cash flow over GAAP EPS."

This stands in contrast to other high-growth names that often trade at premium valuations. The core argument here is that while traditional EPS-based valuation may suggest ELF is priced for perfection, its robust free cash flow profile paints a different, more bullish picture. Over time, EPS is likely to converge upward with free cash flow as the benefits of past intangible investments materialize. This dynamic makes ELF a possible hidden gem for forward-looking investors who prioritize cash-based valuation metrics over conventional earnings, especially in an economy increasingly driven by intangible capital and innovation. Previously, we covered a on e.l.f. Beauty, Inc. by Fierce__beast in November 2024, which highlighted the company's strong fundamentals, strategic acquisitions, and expanding e-commerce and international presence. The company's stock price has depreciated by approximately 0.64% since our coverage. The thesis still stands as long-term drivers remain intact. Francesco Ferrari shares a similar view but emphasizes free cash flow over GAAP EPS. E.l.f. Beauty, Inc. is not on our list of the . As per our database, 29 hedge fund portfolios held ELF at the end of the first quarter, which was 35 in the previous quarter. While we acknowledge the risk and potential of ELF as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and have limited downside risk.

urn:li:share:7344027991577923584,2025-06-26 15:45:18,en,LINKEDIN,"  First time at Cannes ✅ In a few words: an extravagant and synchronicitous incubator for creativity and innovation that is not for the faint of heart. The event is quite literally a sensory marathon of talking and walking set to the stunning (and hot!) backdrop of the French Riviera that just doesn't compute until you've experienced it firsthand. My sincerest thanks to all those who encouraged comfortable shoes, constant water intake, and the reminder to eat food whenever available. Now that I've had a few days to digest the experience and reacclimate to normal life (meetings on Zoom, not on yachts and in chic cafés), I'm eager to share some of my personal highlights: Views of the Croisette and inspiring chats with industry leaders at the The Female Quotient lounge. Restorative afternoon with new friends from Azerion at the OpenAP villa. Steamy morning 5Ks with MAKERS AI and Ultimate Asset. Snowflake Data Clean Rooms brunch with Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Yahoo. Compelling content at the ADWEEK House featuring discussions with brands like Albertsons Media Collective, Canva, Hinge, LinkedIn, and E.L.F. BEAUTY. The Captify® pool party, just as epic as advertised, featuring more new friends from Relo Metrics. Celebratory gatherings with partners at Causal, NextRoll, and Adelaide, and first time meetings with Apple and Effie Worldwide. Some sound bites that resonated 🔈: “Build with, not for” -on collaborating with neurodivergent users to inform product design “Your employees have to be the happiest people before you can expect that of your customers” -on brand being the responsibility of all stakeholders in an organization “Don't wait your turn” -on the importance of female, specifically queer, representation in the workplace “Take confusion and pass along clarity” -on being a manager In closing, thank you Cint for this incredible opportunity, and I look forward to reconnecting with contacts both old and new in the weeks ahead!"

Terez & Honor eyelash serum to help grow those lashes to new heights! Just apply this along the lash line every night to help give you the natural falsies look. Plus, this works on your eyebrows as well! No lash serum will work overnight, but with consistent use, you'll be able to see longer and fuller looking lashes! Promising review: ""I've always been skeptical of lash serums like this, but the reviews were great, so I decided to try it. After using for a few weeks, I noticed that my eyelashes had grown to the point that they touched my eyebrows! I honestly didn't think this was going to work, but was pleasantly surprised when it did. It works great to grow out your eyebrows as well!"" —Erin Get it from Amazon for $22.49. 2. L'Oréal Paris Elvive 8 Second Wonder Water for those of you who don't have the time *or* the money to be sitting in a salon chair all day but still want some luscious-looking locks. Leave this lamellar water treatment in for 8 seconds, yes... 8 seconds only, and rinse out for silkier, shinier, healthier-looking hair. Promising review: ""I don't usually do reviews on products, but for this one I absolutely have to. I have 3c type hair and struggle with a lot a breakage, unmanageability, and moisture. When my mom mentioned this product to me, I didn't take her seriously because of the simple fact that we have two completely different hair textures. I never would have thought this brand would work on my hair ... I have never in my 22 years felt my hair like this. I feel like I have a completely different head of hair. This product is so amazing and I will FOREVER be using this product in my hair regimen."" —Theressa Hailey Get it from Amazon for $10.97. 3. An Anua pore-clearing cleansing oil that'll visibly remove any makeup, sunscreen, or excess sebum from your long day. This K-beauty product (formulated with soothing heartleaf extract) is perfect for anyone looking to double cleanse, and it'll glide on your face so smoothly. Promising review: ""My skin is *super* sensitive, but as I've aged (44 years), I feel like my pores have become more visible. I hadn't used an oil cleanser before and wasn't 100% sure how it should all work. The Anua oil cleanser works how we all once hoped Biore pore strips would work back in the day but without any pain or irritation. My skin is combination skin, so I have to be really careful about not drying out the dry spots (and getting eczema) and not over-hydrating the oily spots (and getting a breakout). I rub the oil on my face as the first part of my cleansing routine; I massage it in for ~60 seconds and then put a small amount of water on my fingers and begin rubbing that on my face. The water starts the emulsification process and helps to clean out everything the oil has bonded to/mixed with. Then, I just rinse it clean and use a gentle cleanser afterward. I haven't had any irritation, redness, or fallout from adding this product to my skincare routine. I love it. I am almost through my first bottle and if I go a few days without using the cleanser, my pores become more visible/dirty again. I will definitely keep purchasing the Anua oil cleanser."" —Tassa Get it from Amazon for $17.69. 4. A waterproof eyeliner stamp if you know all too well the struggle of making the left eyeliner match the right eyeliner only to find that you went overboard and turned yourself into a raccoon. Thanks to this, all you need to do is stamp the wing on the outer corner of your eye and flip it over to the fine tip to finish off the job! Promising review: ""This eyeliner is worth the buy, do it now!!! It is very easy to apply and once it is on, it stays in place unless you wipe it off. I love, love, love this eyeliner. —Catrinna F. The Flick Stick comes from New Zealand-based brand and small biz Lovoir Beauty. Get it from Amazon for $14.98 (available in three sizes and a combo pack). 5.

We officially have the intel on Amazon Prime Day 2025 – and it's bigger than ever. Actually. Back for its 10th year (it first launched in 2025 to celebrate Amazon's 20th birthday), this year's Prime Day will last for four whole days for the first time in the UK (double the two-day norm). Limber up and mark your calendars: the best Prime Day deals will launch in the early hours of July 8, and remain live until midnight on July 11. So, we thought we'd bring you a round-up everything you need to know to prep for the great deals in store. Oh, and before we get properly into it, it's worth flagging that the Prime Day event isn't just a chance to shop for Ninja air fryers, robot vacuum cleaners, noise-cancelling headphones and top Amazon devices (y'know: Kindles, Echo Dots, Ring video doorbells and Amazon fire TV sticks). You will get the lowest price on those, too, but the limited-time discounts don't stop there. Over the past two decades, we've seen no shortage of exclusive deals on bits for the GLAMOUR girls, too. Derm-approved face serums, celeb-adored hair tools and makeup buys of TikTok fame. From Elemis to Garnier (always a Prime Day hit – thanks to their micellar water and vitamin C serum price drops); The Inkey List to Hailey Bieber's beloved Medicube, there are plenty of premium beauty brands for you to save on. In fact, beauty lightning deals often compete with what's on offer during Black Friday. Whether you'll be browsing for a product that has been on your wishlist for a while, or you're stocking up on Amazon gifts, becoming acquainted with the best deals is well worth your time. Your Amazon Prime Day FAQs, answered: When is Amazon Prime Day 2025? What's new for 2025? How long will Amazon Prime Day last? Where will Prime Day 2025 take place? When was Amazon Prime Day 2024? What were the dates of Amazon Prime Days in previous years? Do I have to be a Prime member to shop on Amazon Prime Day? What types of deals can we expect on Amazon Prime Day 2025? What are our Shopping Editors' top tips for shopping on Prime Day? When is Amazon Prime Day 2025? Amazon confirmed in a June press release that its annual extravaganza – the retailer's most popular, global sale event – will take place between 8th July and 11th July. The shopping event will kick off at midnight and end and midnight, making it double the length of previous UK Prime Days. What's new in 2025? Well, the obvious: Amazon Prime Day 2025 is a four-day-event instead of the two-day-event that we're used to, which means shoppers have a full 96 (!) hours to save big on smart watches, security cameras and sparkling highlighters. Aside from that, there are some other changes which were mentioned in Amazon's press release. Namely, the new “Today's Big Deals” daily drops section (Amazon says that will be home to some of the most exciting deals in the event), and the return of Prime for Young Adults (essentially, a discounted Prime membership rate as well as other perks). How long will Amazon Prime Day last? As mentioned above, Prime Day will last the four days in 2025.

It's playing sports. Research backs her up: 94% of women in the C-suite were once athletes. That's because when it comes to the few women who actually make it to the top, there's one striking pattern they all share. “The only correlation they can find of women in the C suite, the CEO spot, it that they all played sport—or the majority played sport,” Melinda French Gates recently explained at the Power of Women's Sports Summit presented by e.l.f. Beauty. “And the thesis is (we don't know why that is) they didn't mind failing,” the 60-year-old billionaire philanthropist and ex-wife of Bill Gates added. “You step out of bounds playing soccer, you go right back to it. You lose the tennis match sometimes. You learn to fail and that failing is okay.” Tennis legend Billie Jean King, who was also on the panel, echoed that girls who play sports growing up go on to have more self-confidence, more resilience and do better in math and science—even if they're just playing to participate, not win. “That's why I want girls in sports,” she added. “They don't have to be best.” “In fact, have you heard of Sally Ride, the first American woman astronaut? I grew up with her in the Los Angeles area,” the 81-year-old champion said, adding that Ride similarly played tennis competitively until her early 20s. Just a few years after walking away from her dream of going pro in tennis, she came across a groundbreaking 1977 NASA ad: the first ever to call for female astronauts. “She was a physicist, she was brilliant, she was always number one in class,” King recalled. “So she signed up to be a woman astronaut, and of course, she got picked to be the first American woman.” “But she told me the reason she got picked was because she'd been a jock. She said, 'I got along better, I understood the male society better, because I've been in sports and I knew their language. I know that's the reason I got chosen first, because I had sports in my life,' and so I just that's one example of what sports can do for you as a person.” College jocks—not nerds—turn out to have more successful careers Gates, King, and Ride aren't imagining it. Jocks really do turn out to be more successful. An extensive study of U.S. Ivy League alumni has shown that those who were consumed with sports—not books—in their youth go on to land more senior positions and high salaries than their “nerdy” peers Despite the age-old cliche that jocks peak in high school, meanwhile the nerds get the last laugh—perhaps, by going on to become a Fortune 500 CEO—athletic students are ironically more likely to land an MBA and then a corporate gig. And that's especially true for women. Echoing Gates, research from EY shows that nearly all women in the C-suite (a staggering 94%) are former athletes. It isn't a coincidence: The leadership qualities cultivated on the playing field, are precisely the ones needed in the boardroom. CEOs previously told Fortune that playing sports growing up taught them confidence, teamwork, discipline, and more. Meanwhile, according to McKinsey, the need for time management, resilience, and a learning mindset are desirable skills both in the C-suite and in sports. “The best leaders today have made a generational change in their thinking, one that closely parallels how elite athletes prepare, train, and compete,” wrote McKinsey partners Bob Sternfels and Daniel Pacthod. “In several ways, the two jobs—CEO and athlete—are highly correlated.” CEOs and sports: From Andy Jassy to Satya Nadella Just look at some of America's top chief executives and you'll soon take stock of how many played some form of sports growing up. In 2011, Fortune even rounded up the Fortune 500 CEOs who were most successful on the playing field, with Samuel J. Palmisano, IBM's former CEO; Walter E. Robb, Whole Foods former CEO; and Boeing's ex-chief James McNerney all making the impressive list. Stephanie Linnartz, the former CEO of Under Armour, told Fortune that as a runner, she learned the importance of treating the pathway to success as a marathon, not a sprint. Most recently, NFL's CFO Christine Dorfler shared not just one, but three ways playing lacrosse at university helped her land the top job. And then there's Amazon CEO Andy Jassy, who before entering the world of work, was an aspiring athlete. The multimillionaire previously reveaeled that he spent “a lot” of his school time on the field playing “all the sports,” instead of keeping his head down and studying. Meanwhile, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has also revealed that playing cricket growing up shaped how he leads today. “Team sports have a huge bearing on who we become as citizens and leaders,” he has previously said. “Cricket is a symphony, and every player is a note in that composition. Leadership in cricket is about being a guiding light and source of inspiration.”"

urn:li:share:7344378814195539968,2025-06-27 14:59:21,en,LINKEDIN,"  Disrupt. Every day. And never stop disrupting. The advice and renegade spirit of e.l.f. founder Joseph Shamah is alive and well in every e.l.f. 21 years after Joey and his father started the company with the crazy idea of selling premium cosmetics for $1 over the internet. But what does disruption actually mean? I define disruption as the path of most resistance. It's a rebuke of the status quo. It's daring to ask 'what if?' and 'why the e.l.f. not?' and translate the answers into bold imperatives with impatience. The high degree of difficulty necessary to turn disruptive ideas into disruption in action at speed is not for the faint of heart. It's for the fearless and heartful. So why all of this talk about bold disruption you ask? Because 21 years into this thing called e.l.f., we've made TIME's list of 'The 100 Most Influential Companies of 2025' - a veritable eyes.lips.first. The banner they are flying our flag under - you guessed it - disrupter. We have stacked the decks with bold change agents who run toward the horizon at e.l.f. speed without getting tripped up looking to the left or to the right. We are a different kind of company. Some people may think we're in the business of beauty - and those that do only see what's on the surface. Those that know us deeply, see far beyond beauty. Like Dr. Marcus Collins who eloquently preaches the gospel of e.l.f. to his congregation: “In a word, e.l.f. is a case study. e.l.f. has a very clear point of view about the world—democratize access—and it informs EVERYTHING the brand does. It's not marketing, per se; it's conviction. It's not strategy as much as it is belief. It's not a gimmick; it's a given. They know who they are and how they see the world, and it permeates the manner in which they show up in the world. In a word, e.l.f. is a case study. And I mean that quite literally. They're a case study on management, leadership, brand, marketing, and all things.” And that is the power of e.l.f.luence. Thank you TIME for this recognition and congrats to all 99 companies who made the list including our friends at ByteDance, Duolingo, DoorDash, Amazon, Walmart, Netflix. Consider us influenced and inspired"

mov_D728DD024072FC44041619817F05858A,2025-06-28 15:20:56,en,WEB,"  Higher prices for a lot of popular products seem inevitable on our current trajectory. James Martin/CNET In a lot of ways and for a lot of products in the US, the biggest impacts of President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff plans are still a ways off in the near future. Still, numerous companies have already hiked prices or said that they will be increased in the near future — including, most recently, a popular and CNET-approved brand of smart lights. The fact of the matter is that tariffs — a tax placed on the importing of certain products into a country — will ultimately cause prices to go up, with Walmart characterizing these eventual price hikes as “inevitable” during its earnings call last month. Given Trump's push to place historically high tariffs on goods from almost every country in the world, you can also expect these price hikes to hit a huge variety of products. This truth has begun to sink in for a lot of Americans, if a recent survey conducted by CNET is anything to go by. According to the results, about 38% of consumers feel pressured to make certain purchases before tariffs cause them to go up in price. About 10% said that they had already made certain purchases out of the hope that they'll avoid a future price hike, and 27% said they had delayed purchases for products that cost more than $500. Overall, these concerns about prices were felt the most around popular tech pieces like smartphones, laptops and home appliances. To help you keep score, I've put together a list of all the companies that have either confirmed or warned of price hikes due to Trump's tariffs. As other companies make such announcements, you can expect new names to be added here. Continue on for all those details, and for more, find out why it's best if you wait on buying a new iPhone. Best Buy Without getting into specifics, Best Buy CEO Corie Barry told the Wall Street Journal late last month that it has already raised prices on certain products as part of its response to the tariffs. e.l.f. Known as an affordable option in the beauty world, e.l.f. announced in late May that it would be implementing a $1 price hike across its product line in response to the tariffs. CEO Tarang Amin claimed that the reaction from customers was positive, on account of the company's transparency. “We're not trying to pull anything over on anyone,” Amin told Fortune. “This is exactly what we're facing, and they understand.” Macy's Speaking to CNBC in late May, Macy's CEO Tony Spring said that price hikes will be implemented on some products due to tariffs, while also emphasizing that other tactics — like discontinuing certain products altogether — will also be a response to rising costs. Mattel Known for brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels, Mattel sounded the alarm over likely price increases during an early May earnings call. While it's unclear how much the toymaker's prices have increased since then, the company told investors that it would be, “where necessary, taking pricing action in its US business,” or to put it plainly, raising prices for consumers to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Nikon Camera-maker Nikon will introduce price hikes in response to Trump's tariffs, effective June 23. This move will only target lenses and accessories the company makes and sells, so the cameras themselves are safe for now. “We will be carefully monitoring any tariff developments and may adjust pricing as necessary to reflect the evolving market conditions,” a statement from Nikon explained. “We wish to thank our customers for their understanding and know that we are taking every possible step to minimize the impact on our community.” Philips Hue Parent company Signify announced that prices for its popular and highly regarded Philips Hue brand of smart lights will see price hikes effective July 1. The company also confirmed that this decision was made “as a direct result of tariffs.” “Signify reserves the right to modify prices based on new or additional tariffs becoming effective in the future,” the company's official statement explained. Ralph Lauren Sales at the luxury goods retailer Ralph Lauren have apparently remained steady amid recent uncertainty, but the company is still forging ahead with a plan to combat tariff impacts by raising prices more than it had already intended to, according to the Wall Street Journal. Shein and Temu Trump's tariffs have made a notable target of China, hitting the country with a 30% rate only after initially hiking it all the way to 145%. Online retailers like Shein and Temu rely on direct shipments from markets like China in order to offer the rock-bottom prices that made them famous, so it's little surprise now that they've had to raise prices. The Trump administration has furthered the issues faced by these companies by doing away with a rule known as the “de minimus” exception, which used to exclude smaller purchases under $800 from import taxes. With that rule gone, Trump's China tariffs will now apply to both bulk orders of industrial building materials and those shoes you've been looking to buy from Shein. Subaru Subaru has hiked prices across almost its entire line. The increase ranged from $750 to $2,055, depending on the model, with only the EV Solterra avoiding any change. As has become a trend with some companies, Subaru avoided attributing the price hikes to Trump's tariffs, citing only the common refrain of “market conditions.” Trump has notably disparaged companies that explicitly lay the blame for price hikes on his policies. “The changes were made to offset increased costs while maintaining a solid value proposition for the customer. Subaru pricing is not based on the country of origin of its products,” a Subaru spokesperson said in a statement to Car & Driver. Stanley Black & Decker In an earnings report published April 30, toolmaker Stanley Black & Decker addressed “Price Actions in Response to US Tariffs,” stating that it had “implemented an initial price increase in April and notified our customers that further price action is required,” and was also looking into ways to shift its supply lines to minimize the impact of tariffs...."

They are the perfect thickness, and even in hot temperatures, they are perfect! I love the high waist and how they stay in place. I have purchased four pairs so far and plan to purchase more in the future. They are true to size."" —Stephanie S Price: $17.99+ (available in sizes XS–4XL and 14 colors) 2. A six-pack of low-cut ankle socks with cushioning that reviewers say are comparable to Bombas but at a fraction of the cost. Promising review: ""So far I have had these for a few weeks and I wear them way more than my Bombas. To be honest, I think the quality of these has been pretty comparable! My husband is picky with socks, so I encouraged him to give them a shot during his workout, and he loved them! I got both white and gray. Highly recommend both."" —Morgs Price: $14.99 (available in sizes S–XL and eight color packs) 3. A Simplehuman pet food storage container you can use for dog food, cat food, or even bird food if you're looking for a convenient yet sleek container that still gives an airtight seal to keep food fresh. Promising review: ""Keeps kibbles fresh as advertised. I buy my husky's kibbles from Costco...so huge! I used to put it in a plastic container (the ones everyone has), and the rest was left in the bag with a chip clip. My husky would eat kibbles alone the first day, but then hardly would touch (unless I added a lot of meat and rice) otherwise. Now she eats her kibbles as if I opened a new bag. Also happy that the whole bag from Costco fits, so no more chip clip! It's pricey but worth it in the long run."" —HH Price: $119+ (available in three sizes and three colors) 4.

Promising review: ""Saved my plants while I was on a week-long trip. I have most of my plants hooked up to drip irrigation but there were a few I hadn't gotten around to yet before I was out of town for a week. Of course we were due to get our first blast of 100+ heat that week so I ordered these to see if it could keep everything alive long enough for me to get back. Worked like an absolute charm both in the landscape and in pots. Will be buying more just because I like the aesthetic around the garden."" —yomamashouse Price: $20.99 for a set of six 5.

Qualsiasi sia la destinazione – mare, montagna o città, o un mix delle tre – prendersi cura della pelle rimane infatti una priorità, a maggior ragione dopo un viaggio lungo che scombina gli equilibri, inclusi quelli cutanei. Quel che si può fare, certamente, è puntare sull'essenziale e, senza la pretesa di infilare in valigia tutto quel che si usa abitualmente a casa, cercare una soluzione compatta con cui rispettare gli spazi ristretti e le limitazioni imposte dalle compagnie aree, per viaggiare leggeri con tutto l'indispensabile per una cute che si mantiene idratata e luminosa ovunque si vada. Basta un kit skincare da viaggio come quello di e.l.f., che racchiude in un pratico beauty case trasparente a prova di controlli tutto quel che serve, dalla detersione fino all'idratazione. Economico, compatto e con prodotti in travel size, è il compagno ideale per le fughe fuori porta dell'estate. Confermano, oltre a me, le quasi 9mila recensioni lasciare sullo shop di Amazon da chi lo ha comprato e testato in prima persona. Skincare da viaggio: il migliore kit per una pelle idratata Quando si hanno in programma dei giorni via o si viaggia in economy, basta davvero poco per assicurarsi ciò di cui la pelle ha bisogno per tutta la durata del viaggio. Ed è per questo che il Jet Set Hydration Kit di e.l.f. è perfetto per queste occasioni. Tutti sotto i 100ml, e quindi idonei anche per il bagaglio a mano, i prodotti inclusi nel kit skincare accompagnano nella routine giorno e notte supportando l'idratazione – condizione essenziale per una cute in salute, luminosa e protetta, su qualsiasi skin type (anche grassa e a tendenza acneica). Jet Set Hydration Kit Il Daily Cleanser a base di ceramidi e acido ialuronico deterge la pelle rimuovendo gli eccessi di sebo, sporco ed SPF, lasciandola fresca, idratata e protetta da quel fastidioso senso di pelle che tira che alcuni detergenti possono causare. Le creme viso sono due, una giorno con acido ialuronico, olio di jojoba e vitamina E – che favorisce l'equilibrio lipidico mentre aumenta le difese naturali della pelle grazie alla presenza di antiossidanti –, e una notte nutriente, che tratta più fondo l'epidermide per rigenerarla durante il sonno. A completare il kit di 5 prodotti ci pensano poi una crema per il contorno occhi che distende lo sguardo e lo rimpolpa, contrastando la disidratazione e la conseguente formazione di linee sottili, ottima sia per il giorno che per la notte, e un balsamo stick pensato come primer idratante con cui preparare la pelle al make-up, per fissarlo al meglio anche nei giorni più caldi. Basta passarlo con movimenti circolari e, se desiderato, stenderlo ulteriormente con le mani per una base trucco fresca e duratura. Perché scegliere il kit skincare di e.l.f. per i viaggi dell'estate (e non solo) Con una media di 4.5 stelle e una circa 400 kit al mese, il Jet Set Hydration Kit si propone come una delle opzioni migliori in termini di qualità-prezzo per una skincare essenziale quando si va in viaggio. Nonostante le piccole dimensioni, infatti, i prodotti hanno dimostrato di poter durare anche più di una settimana, come si legge in alcune recensioni: «Prodotti più che sufficienti per una settimana, utilizzati mattina e sera per la skincare quotidiana. Una bella scoperta anche il “burrocacao per il viso” pre make up! Non serve nemmeno spalmarlo che è già assorbito e lascia la pelle morbida!» «Presi per un viaggio di una settimana ma mi sono durati ben oltre. Qualità ottima tra l'altro. Li consiglio!» «Ottimo set, contiene tutto il necessario per la skincare quando siamo lontani da casa. Prezzo conveniente». Con soli 19€, poi, ci si assicura di avere con sé tutto l'indispensabile per una skincare completa, aggiungendo al bisogno l'uno o l'altro prodotto in caso di esigenze particolari. La versatilità dei prodotti, leggeri e altamente idratanti, offre inoltre un trattamento sicuro su qualsiasi tipo di pelle."

A L'Oreal Paris satin lipstick in the shade ""Worth It"" since you're head over heels for anything in Charlotte Tilbury's Pillow Talk shade, but you'd love it even more if it had a single-digit price tag. Thankfully, you found this baby that's infused with argan oil and vitamin E and still gives you that gorgeous nude-pink tint! Promising review: ""This lipstick has become one of my favorites! It's a staple in my makeup routine, and it's the perfect [swap] for 'Pillow Talk' (IYKYK). It's rich and creamy, lasts a pretty long time, and is a really great value for the price!"" —Tiffiny Rich Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (available in a variety of shades). 2. A classy shoulder bag that could make you think, ""Wait, am I being punk'd?"" since this is a super affordable version of the almost $400 Coach Swing Bag. Plus, it even comes with the iconic Coach Cherry Charm that is $95 alone! Promising review: ""This is THE [alternative] for the Coach Swing bag for a fraction of the price! It even came with a red glittery cherry charm. This bag is so stylish and yes it's on the smaller side but it holds my necessities and I'm the type that carries everything! Highly recommend."" —Anna Get it from Amazon for $35.98+ (available in six colors). 3. A pair of squoval polarized sunglasses, because you know that it doesn't take a pair of designer shades to make it look like you're cooler than everyone else. You're cooler because you just saved yourself from spending a Benjamin Franklin plus some on Ray-Ban sunnies. Promising review: ""Why spend money on Ray-Bans or any other high-end brand when you can have the same quality of sunglasses for [$15]?! These are by far the highest-quality sunglasses I have ever owned. They are durable and look sleek while also effectively blocking rays. I now own three pairs of Sojos, and I will continue to purchase this brand. It's a bonus that these sunglasses also come with a protective pouch AND cleaning cloth."" —Amazon Customer Get them from Amazon for $14.99 (available in 14 styles). 4. E.l.f's Glow Reviver Lip Balm, which many people are comparing to the oh-so-popular Summer Fridays Lip Butter Balm. You'll get that same iconic soft silicone applicator, and it'll leave your lips feeling hydrated and glossy. Promising review: ""Honestly, I figured this was going to be really good considering E.l.f. does great [alternatives] for the actual products. This was amazing. Literally just like Summer Fridays but way cheaper and more pigmented, has the squishy applicator, and the smell is great. Def recommend."" —Jj Get it from Amazon for $9 (available in six shades). 5. A double-pouch wristlet wallet that looks like it could be sold at Lululemon because of how similar it is to their version (which is $48). Save your hard-earned money and get this affordable alternative instead to conveniently hold your cash, car keys, and whatever else you need to bring on the go. Promising review: ""Love this. It's like a Lulu wallet and I love it. Super durable and perfect size for carrying around. Super easy to carry, and very functional."" —leighanne Anderson Get it from Amazon for $7.98+ (available in 11 colors). 6. Slip-on Cushionaire cork sandals for those of you who have been putting off buying Birkenstocks and  will continue to do so  because these are sooo similar. You get the same cushiony feel and great support...."

Cosmetics affordable cleansing balm that starts out solid, melts into an oil, and then turns into a milky texture to rinse off clean. It'll be so satisfying to watch your makeup practically wash away. Plus, it contains hyaluronic acid, ceramides, and peptides to leave your skin feeling smooth and hydrated. Pro tip: Pair this with e.l.f.'s Holy Hydration! Daily Cleanser ($6) for an inexpensive double-cleansing routine. Promising review: ""E.l.f. has really stepped up their game lately! I was using Farmacy Makeup Meltaway, and I loved it, but it was very expensive. I decided to try the E.l.f brand because of the price, and it's the exact same thing! For $11, you can't go wrong with this product. I wear waterproof mascara, and this makes removing it super easy! My face feels super clean and hydrated after using this product. The product lasts for a good amount of time, too."" —Haley McCaulley Get it from Amazon for $10.97. 2. Or, a beloved K-beauty cleansing oil designed to clean makeup residue, potentially clear up blackheads and sebum, and help minimize the appearance of pores and acne. Its hypoallergenic and gentle formula plays well with sensitive and acne-prone skin, and many reviewers actually use it as a step in their double cleansing routine. Double cleansing = using an oil-based cleanser (like this one) and then a water-based cleanser afterward! If you're looking for a water-based cleanser to go with this one, reviewers love this pore-deep cleansing foam from the same brand for their double-cleansing routine! Promising review: ""This is my first time ordering an oil-based cleanser and I'm so glad I purchased this one. I originally saw this product on TikTok and wanted to see what the hype was all about. After using the cleanser on my dry face for 2–3 minutes, I could visibly see the white- and blackheads on my fingers. I was a little hesitant to try oil cleansing because I have acne-prone skin. However, my face has never looked better. After each use, my face is as soft as a baby's bottom, and my scarring doesn't look as deep! The cleanser has a light, clean scent. Not super strong! I am currently pairing this cleanser with the Anua heartleaf soothing toner to achieve glass skin. #glassskinera"" —Myshel Jensen Get it from Amazon for $17.69. 3. An E.l.f. Cosmetics melting lip balm in the shade ""Ecstatic,"" which reviewers say gives the same effortless, your-lips-but-better look as Clinique's ""Black Honey"" — but for a fraction of the price. This balm-lipstick hybrid glides right on, so you can add a sheer wash of color while keeping your lips hydrated. It's the kind of low-maintenance, throw-it-in-every-bag essential that makes getting ready way easier. Promising review: ""I absolutely love this product. The dark color is perfectly sheer. It also adds the most beautiful color to your lips. I am a Clinique Black Honey lip fan, and this gives me the same look for a fraction of the cost. I love it and have multiple that I keep in various spots. Not sticky either, which is my biggest gripe about lip glosses.

n0h5765,2025-06-29 21:43:35,en,REDDIT,"  In terms of learning to paint your nails better, it all comes down to practice! [Here's an article with some tips & tricks from bloggers](https://www.nailcarehq.com/how-to-paint-nails) on how to paint your nails like a pro! You could also look up more videos on YouTube, as there are a ton of tutorials there as well! The main thing is learning polish control, making sure that there isn't too much polish on the brush but there's still enough that you can coat the entire nail without having to dip back into the bottle. This will come with practice & will change depending on the length of your nails. What I like to do is kinda wiggle the wand (what the brush is attached to) against the inside of the neck of the bottle to make sure there isn't a bunch of polish that's gonna drip down & then swipe most of the polish off one side of the brush. [Here's a little video to better explain!] (https://www.reddit.com/user/juleznailedithelps/comments/ka06vu/polish_control/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share) When painting your nails, you're bound to end up with polish somewhere you don't want it to be. You can use a toothpick, a cuticle pusher, or anything small and pointed to kinda scrape the flooded polish out of your cuticles. After removing that excess polish, you can take a small brush (angled eyeliner brushes or small concealer brushes work great for this!) dipped in acetone to gently clean up any remaining polish on your cuticles. The $1 E.L.F. concealer/eyeliner brushes are a super popular option for clean up brushes! I also like to use a [dappen dish](https://www.sallybeauty.com/nails/acrylic-nails/glass-dappen-dish/SBS-154855.html) (you can also buy them on Amazon!) to pour my acetone into so I'm not having to dip into the big container of acetone (a few people have accidentally dropped their brushes in the bottle lol)."

However, based on overall product range affordability and perceived quality, ColourPop consistently emerges as the most accessible entry point into the realm of luxury cosmetics. Understanding the High-End Makeup Spectrum Before pinpointing the most affordable option, it's crucial to establish what constitutes “high-end” makeup and the factors influencing its pricing. We're not solely looking at drugstore brands with elevated claims; we're focusing on brands typically found in department stores, specialty beauty retailers (like Sephora and Ulta), or directly from the brand itself, known for using premium ingredients, advanced formulations, and sophisticated packaging. Defining “High-End” High-end makeup isn't just about a higher price tag. It often signifies: - Superior Ingredient Quality: High-end brands often invest in ethically sourced, skin-friendly, and long-lasting ingredients. - Advanced Formulation Technology: They prioritize innovative formulas for improved pigmentation, blendability, and wear time. - Luxurious Packaging: The aesthetic appeal of the packaging is a key component of the high-end experience. - Brand Prestige: The brand's reputation, image, and marketing contribute to its perceived value. - Extensive Research & Development: Significant investment in product development and testing. Factors Influencing Price Several elements contribute to the higher cost of high-end makeup: - Raw Material Costs: Sourcing high-quality, ethically produced ingredients is expensive. - Research & Development Expenses: Formulating innovative and effective products requires significant investment. - Packaging Design and Production: Luxurious and durable packaging adds to the overall cost. - Marketing and Advertising: Extensive marketing campaigns and celebrity endorsements drive up prices. - Distribution Channels: Selling through department stores and specialty retailers involves higher distribution costs. Why ColourPop Stands Out: Affordable Luxury While numerous brands offer quality makeup, ColourPop has successfully bridged the gap between affordability and luxury. They manage to provide products that perform comparably to higher-priced alternatives while maintaining a significantly lower price point. The Direct-to-Consumer Advantage ColourPop's primary strategy for keeping prices low is its direct-to-consumer business model. By cutting out the middleman (department stores and retailers), they avoid markups and pass the savings on to the customer. This allows them to offer high-pigment eyeshadow palettes, long-wearing lipsticks, and innovative complexion products at a fraction of the cost of competing brands. Production Efficiencies ColourPop is also known for its efficient production processes. They often release products quickly, responding to trends and customer demand. This rapid development cycle, combined with their in-house manufacturing, enables them to control costs and maintain affordability. Targeted Marketing While they invest in marketing, ColourPop primarily focuses on social media and influencer collaborations. This approach is less expensive than traditional advertising methods and allows them to connect directly with their target audience. Other Contenders: Brands Worth Considering While ColourPop takes the crown, several other brands offer relatively affordable options within the high-end makeup category. Makeup Revolution: This brand consistently offers impressive dupes for high-end products at incredibly competitive prices. They are particularly known for their eyeshadow palettes and complexion products. E.L.F. Cosmetics: While often categorized as a drugstore brand, E.L.F. has significantly elevated its quality and product offerings, particularly its “Halo Glow” line. Some of their newer releases rival high-end formulations, making them a strong contender in the “affordable luxury” space. BH Cosmetics: BH Cosmetics is another brand renowned for its affordable eyeshadow palettes and brush sets. While ingredient quality might not be on par with the very top-tier brands, the overall value and performance are impressive. FAQs: Deep Diving into Affordable High-End Makeup Here are some frequently asked questions to further explore the world of affordable high-end makeup: 1. What specific ColourPop products offer the best value for money? ColourPop's eyeshadow palettes, particularly their 9-pan and 12-pan palettes, are consistently praised for their pigmentation, blendability, and diverse color selections. Their Super Shock Shadows are also a cult favorite for their unique texture and vibrant colors. Additionally, their Lux Lipsticks offer a comfortable and long-wearing formula at an accessible price point...."

Olay Super Serum Body Wash has niacinamide, shea butter, and collagen peptides in a formula made to provide 24-hour hydration so you don't have to slather on tons of lotion post-shower just to avoid feeling like a dehydrated dinosaur. Check out a TikTok of the Olay Super Serum Body Wash in action. Promising review: ""I recently tried the Olay Super Serum Body Wash, and I am absolutely in love with it! The formula is incredibly hydrating, leaving my skin feeling soft and smooth after every use. It lathers beautifully and has a lovely, light fragrance that isn't overpowering. After just a few uses, I noticed my skin looked more radiant and felt deeply moisturized. The addition of serums in the body wash is a game changer. My skin feels nourished, and I no longer need to apply lotion right after showering. Highly recommend this to anyone looking for a luxurious, skin-loving body wash!"" —Darina Get it from Amazon for $12.97. 2. Plus, Olay Super Cream with Sunscreen SPF 30 so you're covered in more ways than one when you leave the house. Yes yes, it will help protect your skin from the sun but its formula also has collagen and niacinamide to target fine lines and dark spots. BUT it's lightweight enough to wear under a full face of makeup. Have you met a harder worker? Note that the AAD recommends using at least SPF 30 and reapplying as needed for skin protection. You can read about sunscreen myths and facts from dermatologists for more information! Reviewers say they don't get a white cast with this, like some other SPFs can give ya.

This is great for people who 1) always want a little lip color, 2) hate a sticky feel, and 3) love a bargain. My colleague Emma Lord (who's a fan of the original) has and loves this: ""I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference!"" Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (also available in the pink honey version, and in a two-pack that mixes both!) . 4. E.l.f.

While a personal trip, new places and culture always recharge and inspire me when I get back to work🌍. 2. February - Back to my Alma Mateur Hofstra University📚 to visit the SHE-EOS Women's Business Club💪🏼. It's always a highlight to share my journey and what I learned since being in the classroom. I'm still learning… 3. March - My first Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios Premiere🎬 events in NYC. It's amazing to see the behind-the-scenes of these launches. We even got to meet the parents of a debut actor in the film, who beamed with pride🥹. My client personally introduced herself to Kevin 🥓, so that was incredible. 4. April - Are we still celebrating in-person client events👏🏼? I sure am. The energy of brainstorming🧠 and celebrating🎉 in-person is like no other. Good ideas, and great company. 5. May - Mixing my personal joys with career firsts, I traveled to Hamburg, Germany for the 2025 OMR Festival 👩‍💻. Highlights were, of course, cheering on Kory Marchisotto & Rina Yashayeva for their keynote presentations. E.L.F. BEAUTY 💄continues to be a company I admire, for its creativity, but ultimately its accessibility to the beauty masses. Second - the sheer intelligence 🤯and evolution before my eyes.

This expansion is significantly propelled by the growth of e-commerce and technological advancements that have revolutionized the industry.

1lozl9k,2025-07-01 11:49:54,en,REDDIT,"  Hello! I would really appreciate your help! I'm trying to build a simple, long-lasting base routine for both daily wear and small glam events. My skin is sensitive, acne-prone, and combination, so I really need something that: * Doesn't clog pores or break me out * Feels lightweight and comfortable * Lasts all day (I'm usually out from 6:30 AM to 7:30 PM, with gym after work — I can wash my face before the gym to remove makeup, but sometimes it's a hassle.

mov_9D08993078E11A85C9A929168894607B,2025-07-01 12:00:00,en,WEB,"  Startups are declaring victory everywhere. Pepsi spent a monumental $2 billion for Poppi. E.l.f. cosmetics wired $1 billion to Hailey Bieber for Rhode. Most recently, Unilever swooped up Dr.Squatch for $1.5 billion. Most recently, start-up politician Zohran Mamdani upset Andrew Cuomo in the New York City mayoral primary. Back in February, Mamdani was polling at a negligible one percent. He trounced Cuomo by 43.1 percent to 34.5 percent. These four startup successes show a great deal, individually and collectively, about not just the state of voters and consumers, but also about the zeitgeist and the changing ions in the air. Here's what Mamdani's upset of the mature brand Cuomo proves about legacy entities and institutions. What you see is not all that's there Much has been made of Mamdani's effective use of social media. I don't need to relitigate that. What hasn't been widely discussed, though, is that the hyper-targeted nature of Instagram and TikTok—and how their algorithms work—means that if you weren't in the potential voting audience, you likely weren't exposed to the full firehouse of his social media posts. As a result, the palpable sense of a movement being formed and gaining momentum, of a political phenomenon in the works, was totally lost on voters outside the Mamdani demographic, or even reporters. It's the availability heuristic at work, which describes the psychological process by which your worldview is shaped by that which you grok from your zone of perception. Featured Video An Inc.com Featured Presentation The message to legacy brands is that they, too—despite all their consumer research and the marketing tools available—are locked in their own narrow world of observation. The blinders they have on—that block a wide-angle view of the world—are hardwired into the human brain by evolutionary biology. Younger hunger The conventional wisdom is that young voters don't vote. According to researchers at the University of California, they are “fatalistic about critical problems such as economic inequality, climate change, and the future of democracy.” The election in America's largest city proved these experts, and so many others, wrong. Young people turned out because they have a hunger for change and a belief in new possibilities, no matter what you might think of their choice. The startup brand successes were all driven by the same muscular rejection of traditional options. This puts legacy brands in a double-bind. Their systems are both unable to innovate and connect with consumers on the emotional level that start-ups can. At the same time, those very systems crush the soul of these startup brands once they acquire them. As soon as the earn-out is paid, founders flee. A perfect example of an innovation-crusher, ironically, is Unilever, the buyer of Dr. Squatch. They acquired the hot Dollar Shave Club, turned it ice cold, and sold it to private equity. If legacy brands don't allow acquired brands to continue unaltered, they will destroy value. Inspiration before explanation Mamdani has been criticized for making promises without explaining how he will pay for them. For example, free buses and child-care, freezing the rent, and launching city-owned grocery stores. It has been said you campaign in poetry and govern in prose, and in this case, the candidate was Milton-esque. This is also true for marketing, especially in the exploding wellness and self-care category. David Beckham's IM8 promises “Daily Ultimate Longevity” through its “Cell Rejuvenation Technology.” Neuro's campaign—and how interesting that politicians and brands both run campaigns claims “neuroprotection, mitochondrial stabilization, and longevity in one capsule.” That's a lot of poetry. Too many legacy brands—in consumer goods, technology, and virtually every category—get the sequence wrong. They start with explanations and lose the audience before the conversation starts. Better to start with inspiration, which frames the brain, activates dopamine, and makes the consumer—or voter—ready and predisposed to believe. No laurels for legacy Andrew Cuomo, as both a multi-term governor and a son of a former governor, was the ultimate legacy candidate. Not many candidates have their last name emblazoned on a bridge. He behaved with that entitlement. The New York Times said it was widely acknowledged that his campaign was “joyless and lackluster.” The new reality is that legacy brands actually have to work harder than the newbies. They have to out-hustle their start-up competitors because creation in a vacuum can be much easier than shifting within a zone...."

mov_7F13C1D100441F95585B55B3DE4496D4,2025-07-01 16:03:00,en,WEB,"  Scooter Braun is transitioning his role at HYBE, the South Korean entertainment giant, moving from CEO of HYBE America to an advisory position which will have him joining the HYBE Board of Directors as a director and a senior advisor to chairman and CEO Bang Si-Hyuk. The move marks the end of a five-year run at HYBE, which is home to such K-pop acts as BTS and Katseye. The news was announced to HYBE staffers on Monday when Braun, dialing in from David Geffen's yacht where he is vacationing, notified employees that the move was “in the works for quite some time,” according to a source who adds that the five-year plan was initiated with the sale of Braun's Ithaca Holdings to HYBE in 2021. Braun will remain active in current HYBE projects, like the just-launched girl group Katseye. Braun intimated that he “isn't going anywhere” and will “still help guide” the artists on the HYBE roster. During the call, Braun shared with the staff that, when he set out for a career in music 25 years ago, it was after reading the Geffen biography The Operator. Today, as he closes this chapter of his career, he reminded his colleagues of what he's learned from Geffen: “Follow your dreams and anything can happen.” Braun built his business managing music artists like Justin Bieber, Ariana Grande, J Balvin, Demi Lovato and The Kid LAROI under the SB Projects banner. In 2024, he stepped away from the management business, announcing his decision on social media, where he noted, “I have been blessed to have had a 'Forrest Gump'-like life while witnessing and taking part in the journeys of some of the most extraordinarily talented people the world has ever seen. I'm constantly pinching myself and asking 'how did I get here?'” The exit from management coincided with a split from Bieber which turned contemptuous, as THR reported in April, due to financial consequences triggered by the cancelation of Bieber's Justice tour in 2022. In not fulfilling his contractual obligation to AEG (the tour's promoter) and completing the concert dates, for which he received a $40 million advance, Bieber was left owing more than $20 million to AEG. Then-manager Braun, through his company, covered what was owed in the form of a loan at a highly favorable (to Bieber) rate. In addition, the two were partnered in a number of other businesses including a record label and film projects. Braun also helped secure a $200 million catalog deal for Bieber's songwriting interests, possibly the largest nest egg in music history for an artist under 30. (Worth noting: Hailey Bieber, who married Justin in 2018, recently sold her Rhode Beauty skincare brand to e.l.f. Beauty for $1 billion; Braun was a seed investor.) THR has learned that a settlement between Braun and Bieber is now completed. “Scooter and Justin squashed their issues and are in a good place,” says a source who adds that Braun's last act at HYBE was to close the book on the squabble and “leave the company, and Justin, in a good position.” Reps for Bieber declined to comment on the settlement. Stepping into the CEO position in Braun's place and leading all day-to-day duties is Isaac Lee, who has been chairman of HYBE Latin America since November of 2023. Lee's new title is chairman and CEO of HYBE Americas. In addition to running HYBE's operations in Mexico, Miami, and Medellin, Lee will also have oversight of Nashville-based Big Machine Label Group (BMLG) and Quality Control Media Holdings, headquartered in Atlanta. While Braun's next move is unclear, HYBE chief Bang Si-Hyuk commented, “Scooter has been an extraordinary partner, a visionary executive, and a true catalyst for cultural exchange. His contributions have been vital in establishing our ambitious presence in the U.S. market. I am deeply grateful for his leadership, his astute instincts and his unwavering passion for artists. We wish him immense success in his exciting next chapter and look forward to continuing our partnership in executing HYBE's global vision.” More in Business Braun also remains one of HYBE's largest individual shareholders. In announcing his new role, Braun said: “Being a part of HYBE and witnessing its remarkable growth has been one of the most inspiring chapters of my professional journey. Chairman Bang is a true visionary and a musical genius. What he has built with HYBE is unparalleled. I am incredibly proud of our collective accomplishments and look forward to supporting Chairman Bang and CEO Jason Jaesang Lee in their continued success as I step into what's next.”"

They're also drawing some businesses into legal battles. In the latest example, Lululemon slapped a lawsuit against Costco on Friday, accusing the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure apparel. Across the retail industry, it's far from a new phenomenon. But social media is pushing the culture of online dupe shopping to new heights as influencers direct their followers to where they can buy the knockoffs. Want a taste of Hermès' $1,000 fuzzy slippers? Target has a version for $15. Looking for a $2,800 price Bottega Veneta hobo bag? There's a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas. It's not even the first time Lululemon has encountered what it says are knockoffs of its clothing, which often carry steep price tags of over $100 each for leggings and sporty zip-ups. Without specifying additional sellers beyond Costco in Friday's complaint, Lululemon noted that a handful companies have “replicated or copied” its apparel to sell cheaper offerings — including those popularized online through hashtags like “LululemonDupes” on TikTok and other social media platforms. Dupes aren't new For years, marketers have rolled out less expensive fashion and beauty alternatives for consumers to buy instead of pricey designer brands. Unlike more traditional counterfeits, which are illegal copies of the product that feature an unauthorized trademark or logo of a patented brand, “pure” dupes that resemble certain features of more expensive products are generally legitimate. They can even spark awareness of the original items. But the rising frenzy for dupes signals that many shoppers want a taste of luxury, but no longer want to pay for (or care about) getting the real thing. Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Hermès' coveted Birkin bag. The $78 item — sold by Kamugo, which doesn't appear to have its own website — was a fraction of the price of the original, which goes from $9,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars on resale and auction sites. Influencers labeled the leather bag a “wirkin.” Other suppliers including BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy were listed on Walmart's site selling similar totes. When dupes venture into uncertain legal territory Experts say some dupes move into shaky legal territory, including copyright and trademark infringement, particularly when a dupe marketer makes false claims about the duplicate or the original. Look-alikes can also frustrate the targeted companies. Following the viral fame of the “wirkin,” for example, Hermès Executive Chairman Axel Dumas said he was “irritated” and “annoyed” by the cheaper look-alikes. “Making a copy like this is quite detestable,” Dumas said in a corporate earnings call in February. Still, he acknowledged that it was “quite touching” to see so many consumers want a bag with the Birkin style — and that “difference in quality” was still evident, noting that nobody bought the dupe thinking it was from Hermès. Meanwhile, Benefit sued E.l.f. for trademark infringement over its $6 Lash 'N Roll mascara, which is similar to Benefit's $29 Roller Lash mascara. But in December, a California judge found that E.l.f.'s mascara didn't deceive shoppers and didn't infringe the trademarks and trade dress of Benefit's item. That was the first lawsuit of its kind in E.l.f.'s 20-year-history, and the judge's decision was “a resounding win for us,” CEO Tarang Amin previously told The Associated Press. Amin doesn't like to call his version dupes, referring to them as “holy grails"" instead. “The basic reality is we always put our E.l.f. twist on it,” he said. “It's an E.l.f. product that's a much better value.” Lululemon sues Costco In its lawsuit, Lululemon argued that Costco had “unlawfully traded” on Lululemon's reputation and that it was suing as part of wider intellectual property enforcement “directed to retailers who have chosen to copy rather than compete.” A message was left Tuesday seeking comment from Costco on the lawsuit. The litigation could be more complicated because Lululemon also alleges that customers know Costco uses manufacturers of popular branded products for its private label Kirkland brand, although the companies involved don't reveal that information. Due to this, Lululemon claims at least some shoppers may believe that Kirkland-branded products are made by the authentic supplier of the “original” products. Lululemon accuses Costco of making duplicates of several producings, including its popular Scuba hoodies, Define jackets and ABC pants. Lululemon says one of the duplicates that Costco sells is the Hi-Tec Men's Scuba Full Zip, with the lawsuit showing a screenshot image of Costco's website showing the item priced at $19.97. Lululemon found itself in a similar dispute with Peloton back in 2021, when it sued the exercise bike company over alleged “copycat products” in its then-new clothing lines. Two years later, the companies announced a five-year partnership that included Lululemon becoming the primary athletic apparel partner to Peloton. —- AP Business Writer Michelle Chapman contributed to this report."

mov_3E08F639B785B717385F1598636A4322,2025-07-01 20:29:09,en,WEB,"  NEW YORK (AP) — Fashion “dupes,” or less expensive versions of high-end clothing and other accessories, are just about everywhere these days. They're also drawing some businesses into legal battles. In the latest example, Lululemon slapped a lawsuit against Costco on Friday, accusing the wholesale club operator of selling lower-priced duplicates of some of its popular athleisure apparel. Across the retail industry, it's far from a new phenomenon. But social media is pushing the culture of online dupe shopping to new heights as influencers direct their followers to where they can buy the knockoffs. Want a taste of Hermès' $1,000 fuzzy slippers? Target has a version for $15. Looking for a $2,800 price Bottega Veneta hobo bag? There's a version for $99 on online clothing and accessories upstart Quince, which has become a go-to for fashionistas. It's not even the first time Lululemon has encountered what it says are knockoffs of its clothing, which often carry steep price tags of over $100 each for leggings and sporty zip-ups. Without specifying additional sellers beyond Costco in Friday's complaint, Lululemon noted that a handful companies have “replicated or copied” its apparel to sell cheaper offerings — including those popularized online through hashtags like “LululemonDupes” on TikTok and other social media platforms. Dupes aren't new For years, marketers have rolled out less expensive fashion and beauty alternatives for consumers to buy instead of pricey designer brands. Unlike more traditional counterfeits, which are illegal copies of the product that feature an unauthorized trademark or logo of a patented brand, “pure” dupes that resemble certain features of more expensive products are generally legitimate. They can even spark awareness of the original items. But the rising frenzy for dupes signals that many shoppers want a taste of luxury, but no longer want to pay for (or care about) getting the real thing. Late last year, for example, discount chain Walmart created a buzz when it started selling a leather bag online that resembled Hermès' coveted Birkin bag. The $78 item — sold by Kamugo, which doesn't appear to have its own website — was a fraction of the price of the original, which goes from $9,000 to hundreds of thousands of dollars on resale and auction sites. Influencers labeled the leather bag a “wirkin.” Other suppliers including BESTSPR, YMTQ and Judy were listed on Walmart's site selling similar totes. When dupes venture into uncertain legal territory Experts say some dupes move into shaky legal territory, including copyright and trademark infringement, particularly when a dupe marketer makes false claims about the duplicate or the original. Look-alikes can also frustrate the targeted companies. Following the viral fame of the “wirkin,” for example, Hermès Executive Chairman Axel Dumas said he was “irritated” and “annoyed” by the cheaper look-alikes. More in Business “Making a copy like this is quite detestable,” Dumas said in a corporate earnings call in February.

BeautyのCMOであるコリー・マルキゾット氏は、「いまZ世代に刺さるのは、“完璧な映像”ではなく“リアルな共感”だ」と語りました。 完璧に編集されたビジュアルや脚本された言葉ではなく、むしろ未完成さや素直な表現の中に、ユーザーが自己を投影できる“余白”がある、そうした感性が支持を集めているという指摘でした。 e.l.f.は、TikTok上で自社の楽曲『Eyes. Lips. Face.』※2をバイラルヒットさせ、ユーザー生成コンテンツ戦略で注目を集めた後も、“共創型マーケティング”を軸にしたキャンペーン展開を続けています。 2024年から実施している、ジェンダーバイアスにユーモアで切り込んだ『So Many Dicks』キャンペーンが話題となり、Cannes Lions 2025ではCreative Data Lions部門（Use of Humor）でSilver Lionを受賞。 さらにTitanium Lionsのショートリストにも選出され、実績としても高く評価されました。 マルキゾット氏は「共創には、私たちが信じる“声”が必要だ」と強調し、「単なるエンタメではなく、“信念をもって語るストーリー”が、ロイヤリティと購買に直結する」と語っていました。 この「共感を起点としたストーリーテリング」は、単にSNSでの拡散を狙うものではなく、ブランドそのものの“人格”を表すものだとする視点は、非常に実践的です。 同様のテーマは、Hello Sunshineの創設者であり俳優・プロデューサーのリース・ウィザースプーン氏も共有していました。..."

An exquisite tinted lip balm shockingly similar to Clinique's ""Black Honey"" but doesn't cost nearly as much. It comes in a weightless, non-sticky formula that glides onto your pout to give 'em a subtle polished tint of your choosing. Soon you'll be smackin' your lips all over the place, and no one can really blame you when they look this good. ♀ My colleague Emma Lord can vouch for this: ""I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference!"" Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a pink honey version, individually, and as a two-pack that includes both!) . 2.

It never hurts to have ✨options✨ and you won't find a better bang for your buck. Promising review: ""I've been buying these for years. They replaced my Ray-Bans that look identical! Fit great and with the price point I don't have to worry too much with my kids and being on the go!"" —Jessica M Get a pack of three from Amazon for $18.99+ (available in 13 sets, as well as packs of two and individual pairs). 3. E.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen if you, like me, are wondering when sunscreen became one of the most expensive skincare items ever? Enter this affordable find, which offers SPF 35 *and* goes on smooth and clear without any white cast. It works well as a blurring primer to create the perf setup before applying makeup too! TL:DR; it's the more affordable version of Supergoop! My colleague Jenae Sitzes uses it: ""The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop! 's cult-fave product end. I've tried both, and I honestly prefer this E.l.f. version. Supergoop! 's had a slight graininess to it that I didn't love, while this E.l.f. sunscreen is exactly what I'd hoped Supergoop! 's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop! 's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop! 's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop! 's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top!"" Promising review: ""This sunscreen is a gem. I was not expecting to love it as much as I do. I absolutely love E.l.f. products, but I rarely try their skincare...."

353ffb64eee683bc3c4823c67a422e48,2025-07-03 12:34:00,en,WEB,"  The Black Beauty market is exhibiting robust expansion driven by increasing consumer demand for inclusive and culturally resonant cosmetic and personal care products. Industry leaders are capitalizing on the growing preference for products tailored to diverse skin tones and hair textures, which is reshaping market dynamics significantly. Market Size and Overview The Global Black Beauty Market size is estimated to be valued at USD 8.96 billion in 2025 and is expected to reach USD 23.11 billion by 2032, exhibiting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.5% from 2025 to 2032. Black Beauty Market Forecast indicates strong market opportunities fueled by rising awareness, product innovation, and expanded retail penetration. The market report highlights an escalating market revenue trajectory driven by the increasing demand for specialty skincare, cosmetics, and hair care products that address unique needs within the Black community. Impact of Geopolitical Situation on Supply Chain A notable real-world example is the US-China trade tariffs implemented in late 2024, which disrupted the supply of essential botanical extracts and synthetic ingredients vital to Black beauty formulations. This led to increased procurement costs for key players, compelling shifts toward nearshoring and strengthened supplier diversification in North America and Africa. Consequently, market growth strategies shifted to mitigate supply risks, ensuring steady market size expansion despite geopolitical turbulence. SWOT Analysis - Strengths: - Growing consumer demand for culturally attuned products is bolstering market revenue and industry size. - Enhanced R&D and personalization technologies increase market share and business growth potential. - Strong brand loyalty among core consumers fuels stable revenue streams. - Weaknesses: - Dependency on international raw materials exposes supply chains to geopolitical and economic uncertainties. - Regulatory compliance costs, especially in major markets like the EU, present ongoing market restraints. - Fragmented market segments in emerging regions limit rapid scalability. - Opportunities: - Rising e-commerce adoption in developing markets is expanding market scope and revenue streams. - Sustainability trends open markets for innovative natural and eco-friendly Black beauty products. - Strategic collaborations between market players and local manufacturers to optimize supply chains. - Threats: - Intensifying competition from niche and indie brands could dilute market share among established players. - Economic downturns and inflationary pressures might restrain consumer discretionary spending. - Political instability in key sourcing regions continues to threaten uninterrupted raw material flow.

5173a9a9a8de2f69f518598a9b580a5a,2025-07-03 15:28:00,en,WEB,"  AARP Hearing Center Summer is not always smooth sailing … at least not beauty-wise. After 50, the challenges amp up as the weather and sun-and-fun lifestyle mess with our looks and confidence. Women say, “My makeup feels slimy and disappears in a pool of sweat” and “Help! I wear one-piece swimsuits but need some extra grooming,” or “I love breezy midi skirts, but how do I stop the chafing between my thighs?” So relatable! As a beauty and fashion editor, stylist and personal shopper for women over 50, I hear complaints like these daily. Here's how to avoid and solve some of the most talked-about disasters. 1. Melty, greasy, cakey makeup Some women insist that matte formulas and powder are the way to go when it comes to summer makeup. Big mistake! Combine that strategy with heat, sweat and a hot flash or two, and all you'll have is a cakey, dull mask on your face. Other women blithely ignore the weather and continue to layer serums, moisturizer, sunscreen and makeup like it's dry, icy February, not steamy July. Of course, this bunch ends up with a runny, soggy mess that's gooey, not glowy. Looking fresh-faced during a heat wave depends on your willingness to pare down your makeup routine in favor of multitasking products that prevent buildup and reduce slide. To keep skin plumped, protected and polished during the day, all you need is one thing: a tinted moisturizer with built-in sun protection, like Merit Uniform Tinted Mineral Sunscreen SPF 45 ($38, kohls.com) or Tower 28 Beauty SunnyDays SPF30 Tinted Sunscreen Foundation ($32, sephora.com); or, for extra coverage, a CC cream like IT Cosmetics Your Skin But Better CC+ Nude Glow SPF 40 ($47, target.com). The effect is subtly radiant and not greasy, sticky or shiny. If your skin feels wet or clammy as the day goes on, dampen a makeup sponge with cool water, squeeze out the excess and press it on spots where you have perspiration breakthrough. Then reapply the tinted moisturizer. If you're a heavy sweater, try a waterproof, sweatproof setting mist like Milani Make It Last Original- Natural Finish Setting Spray ($13, walgreens.com) or e.l.f. Stay All Night Micro-Fine Setting Mist ($10, cvs.com) — not powder. Simply spray it onto a makeup sponge and gently press it onto oil-prone areas like the sides of the nose and forehead, and in deep expression lines like those that extend from the nose to the mouth. 2. Bust, thigh and body chafing Can't stand the term “chub rub”? Me neither. However, it does describe the situation when one sweaty inner thigh meets its mate. This kind of irritation is not limited to the thighs. It also happens to bare, damp skin under sweaty bra bands and straps, sandal straps, waistbands on skirts and pants, even under the neckline border and leg-line openings of some swimsuits. One supereffective solution to chafing is wearing a light and stretchy control panty, like Red Hot by Spanx Women's Light Control Shapewear Primers Midthigh 10162R in Champagne Nude or Black ($26, kohls.com), under skirts and dresses, even breezy midis and maxis. Choose those with a cotton gusset that can be worn in place of underwear, long enough to cover the sensitive area. Anti-chafe sticks, a current and growing beauty trend, are another way to go. Designed like stick deodorant, they have a silky, almost powderlike finish that glides over the skin and creates a stay-put barrier to friction while soothing irritation with ingredients like aloe, coconut oil, grapeseed oil and shea butter. Some, like Megababe Thigh Rescue Anti-Friction Stick ($14, target.com), are designed for a specific spot. Others, like Dove Anti-Chafe Whole Body Deo in Raspberry & Rose ($13, cvs.com), which is gynecologist- and dermatologist-approved, and First Aid Beauty Anti-Chafe Stick ($20, nordstrom.com), work head to toe. 3. Frizzy, out-of-control hair Summer is frizz season. Just ask women who struggle to keep their smooth, sleek blowouts and polished curls from going haywire. Sure, genes are partly to blame, but sizzling, humid temperatures also cause styled hair to revert to its prestyled texture. Here's why: Once hair escapes the cool indoor environment of air-conditioning, it absorbs moisture from the air, and the hair shaft swells and produces a fluffy, unruly look. Your best fast fix is a chic hair band, claw clip or scrunchie, so throw these in your bag on humid days. Many women ask me about salon keratin treatments. They do delete frizz for the summer, but the intense chemicals, including formaldehyde, and reactions, including headache, stinging eyes, throat issues, and rashes, are a turnoff. So is the $350 to $800 cost and the possible harm to weak, fragile, thin or damaged hair. My advice? Try one of the new frizz banishers that activate with the heat from a blow-dryer. Color Wow Dream Coat Supernatural Spray for Frizzy Hair ($12, kohls.com), Tresemmé Keratin Smooth Blowout Heat Protectant Spray ($9, target.com) and John Frieda Frizz Ease Smooth Operator Blowout Spray ($12, cvs.com) keep hair smooth through three or more shampoos. Unlike frizz serums and creams, there's no heavy residue to weigh hair down, and results last for a steamy, sticky week or two. It's worth the extra time and effort to do the initial precise, section-by-section blow-dry with a round brush."

An exquisite tinted lip balm shockingly similar to Clinique's ""Black Honey"" but it doesn't cost nearly as much. This weightless, non-sticky formula glides onto your pout to give 'em a subtle polished tint of your choosing. Soon you'll be smackin' your lips all over the place, and no one can blame you when they look this good. ♀ My colleague Emma Lord can vouch for this: ""I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference!"" Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a pink honey version, individually, and as a two-pack that includes both!) . 2. Catrice ""Instant Awake"" Under Eye Brightener — it'll help liven up your tired eyes with a lightweight formula that delivers superb coverage in just a few swipes. This tinted concealer contains hyaluronic acid and shea butter that may also help reduce dark circles over time. It's just like the $33 Becca version but for MUCH less. Promising reviews: ""Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it."" —Placeholder ""I ran across this when looking to replace my $33 Becca under-eye brightening cream, and since money is tight, I took a chance. Very surprised to find this product to be comparable in coverage and staying power, and superior in moisture. Highly recommend!"" —Nancy Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades). 3. A TikTok-beloved ""Soft"" perfume rollerball reviewers can't stop raving about, with some even comparing it to lemon pound cake. YUM! This is gonna be a real treat for your senses *and* it rolls on nice and easy. It's basically a budget-friendly version of Pink Sugar, which goes for $65. Promising review: ""It's definitely a [swap] for Pink Sugar, only better. To me, Pink Sugar has changed and now dries down to a too-forward pepper smell that overpowers the sugar. This doesn't do that, it's exactly like Pink Sugar when it first goes on with sweet and powdery scent profiles, and remains that way after dry down...on me, this is what I'm getting anyway. It lasts and lasts too like a quality oil perfume should."" —Criss Get it from Amazon for $4.50. 4. A lash-extending E.l.f. Cosmetics tubing mascara because your lashes deserve the best and you don't wanna waste your time with dry, clumpy (pricey) formulas. This one is perfect for thin, delicate lashes and is similar to Thrive. The lightweight tubing technology wraps around your eyelashes for a smudge-proof lift that looks natural. Plus, it's super easy to take off at the end of the day without tons of harsh scrubbing. Check out a TikTok of the E.l.f. mascara in action...."
n18dkf3,2025-07-04 01:34:50,en,REDDIT,"  I recommend Saturday Skin Glacier Water Cream and some hyaluronic acid serum from the following brands: COSRX, The Ordinary or e.l.f Triple Bounce serum. Always apply hyaluronic acid after washing your skin especially while your skin is still damp for maximum absorbtion. Ps. Make sure to use a gentle face wash so it's not stripping your skin of moisture. For face wash I use Anua Hyaluronic Acid 8+ Panthenol face wash. All of this can be found on Amazon. I hope this helps. One more thing make sure you're using an SPF. Another brand I recommend for SPF is the Beauty of Joseon Daily Relief Sunscreen or The Nyx Sunscreen/primer for a good sticky base that has sun protection and if you're on the go and not wearing any sunscreen the e.l.f sun stick is a good option."

Sofa Club CEO Louis Rose passes away after fighting cancer with 'grit, determination and bravery' Sofa Club co-founder Louis Rose has passed away at the age of 35, after a battle with cancer. He is survived by his wife and three children. Earlier this year, Rose revealed that he was undergoing treatment for Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia (APL). This came after a fight against cancer that began in November 2023, when he was diagnosed with tonsil cancer. Following months of chemotherapy and radiotherapy, he was initially told this had gone. However, in October 2024, he received the news that it had returned. Rose then underwent a 13-hour operation with Professor Paleri and his team at the Royal Marsden in London. The surgery was declared a success, but then came the APL diagnosis.

This is the result of an update to its fair use policy. Somewhat unsurprisingly, disgruntled customers have taken to social media to vent spleen. For instance, Rhea Sangha, Senior Marketing Manager at John Lewis Partnership, said in a LinkedIn post: ""This morning I received an email from Asos to inform me they were closing my account. I was pretty gobsmacked as I am die hard, loyal fan and have been a regular customer for years. It's my go to for holidays, weddings, parties and I bloody love Topshop!!"" ""Yes, I'm a big shopper so yes as a result I probably do send a fair amount of returns (which I pay for!) but isn't that the nature of online shopping? Isn't that what happens when you can't feel the material/see the quality/check the sizing/try on the clothes to see how a style suits your figure. And as a curvy girl - NOT easy! Clothes unfortunately do not fit me like a glove…"" She added: “I spend hundreds of pounds year with Asos, in the last month alone I've purchased 12 items and spent £350+. I know quite a few other friends this has happened to who have complained for several months to Asos with no real clarity or solution. Is this really how retailers should be treating their best customers? Is this what loyalty should feel like?"" ""Very disappointing.

But the cool part was she actually had an offer to do something pretty big and cool in the cosmetics a couple years ago and didn't. ""The reason it's succeeding is people are responding to it.

He said: ""The sweet part of my kids, too, is, in the wake of whatever their success is, their dad remains the same. I've always been the same way. You know you're going to tell your daughter the truth."" Hailey - who is married to pop star Justin Bieber and has 11-month-old son Jack Blues with him - sold her company to e.l.f. Beauty in a deal estimated to be worth up to $1 billion, but she'll stay on as chief creative officer and head of innovation as well as acting as a consultant to e.l.f. Beauty - and Hailey is adamant the arrangement will help her take the products to a whole new level and expand across the world. She told Glamour magazine: ""When you're launching a brand, you're just so focused on what's right in front of you at the time. ""And of course, you always have really big dreams and really big goals for it. This is definitely one of those things being realised. I could have never anticipated that it would happen at this exact time ... ""I'm super excited ... I'll be the chief creative officer and head of innovation at Rhode and advisor to Elf Beauty.

Email tips@dailymail.com Stephen Baldwin is proud of his daughter Hailey Bieber, 28, for selling Rhode to e.l.f. Beauty for $1 billion. 'It took her three years,' the actor told Adam Carolla during a recent episode of The Adam Carolla Show. 'What, did you think that was just some rotten tomatoes journey? The cool part of it is she's super smart, smart in business,' he continued of the 28-year-old. His kind words came in the wake of a family rift after he publicly urged fans to pray for her and her husband Justin Bieber, which she considered to be him meddling in their affairs, a source told DailyMail.com. 'Succeeded as a model prior to everything she's doing now. But the cool part was she actually had an offer to do something pretty big and cool in the cosmetics a couple years ago and didn't.' Stephen, 58, went on to explain that Hailey didn't just endorse a brand someone else came up with, she made products that she would use herself. 'The reason its succeeding is people are responding to it,' he noted. ' It actually works as hydration and all of that.' Stephen is also dad to 32-year-old daughter Alaia Baldwin Aronow and he revealed he takes a hands-off approach to his kids' careers. 'I let my kids do what they're doing,' he shared. ' And if they want to throw a boomerang at me, I'll call them back.' Plus, both of his girls are married to successful men and he gushed over Justin Bieber and Alaia's husband Andrew Aronow. As Stephen added, 'I'm blessed that my two daughters married two great guys.' He also insisted that family comes first. 'The sweet part of my kids, too, is, in the wake of whatever their success is, their dad remains the same,' he gushed. 'I've always been the same way. You know you're going to tell your daughter the truth.' And he's crediting Hailey with helping Justin through the hard time he's having lately. The Usual Suspects actor said: 'I am just glad he connected with a great gal to help him survive.' Stephen added: 'Their happiness and their wellbeing and their health is more obviously now better than ever.' In August 2024, Hailey and Justin welcomed their first child, son Jack Blues, and his grandad Stephen gushed with pride about the newborn describing him as 'incredibly cute'. Asked about the new parents, who got married in 2018 after a whirlwind romance, Stephen said that new parenthood has been 'very relaxed' for the couple. He added: 'They're just spending really sweet, private quality time with Jack and we're just getting ready to watch him come out on the world here, come out on the scene.' He also offered his babysitting services: 'Sometimes grandpa can clean up. You know what I'm saying?' Hailey is allegedly choosing to keep her parents away from her baby son Jack amid her ongoing tensions with the pair, according to sources who say she has long clashed with Stephen and Kennya Baldwin over religious and political beliefs. Though her father celebrated the birth of his grandson with a post on Instagram, which Hailey did not like from her own account, the model's mother raised eyebrows after choosing not to mark the moment on her own social media feed. It highlights Hailey's strained relationship with her parents, which reportedly started to 'break down' further when the beauty mogul fell pregnant. 'Hailey's relationship with her family has been eroding for some time now,' a source told DailyMail.com exclusively. 'She was closer with her mom, but that started to break down when she fell pregnant because she didn't want to tell her family for months.' The insider explained that the situation that ultimately pushed Hailey over the edge was when her father shared a post asking fans to pray for Hailey and Justin, something which sparked concern for the couple."

CeraVe's Retinol Serum, which lives up to the CeraVe name and uses *encapsulated* retinol to reduce the appearance of scars and pores without flaking or redness. If you haven't gotten into retinoids yet or are worried about irritating your skin, this gentle but effective serum is a great option — and reviewers say they like it better than other more expensive options (like Murad's Retinol Serum, which retails for $92). And remember, like with any retinol (that actually works) *just do not use it every day. * Start slow and work yourself up if needed, paying attention to your skin. Promising review: ""I absolutely love this stuff! I saw a dermatologist on TikTok who raved about this product and tried it out, and it's been the most amazing stuff! It's helped my face to clear up very quickly removing all of the blemish spots and dark spots around my face. It's been one of the best products I've added to my face routine. This would be great for all ages/stages and for any weather types. It doesn't moisturize much, but that's not it's intention, and there is no scent, so I'd imagine it's great for all skin types and hypoallergenic."" —Successful Solo Promising review: ""I bought this for my teenager to use for his acne scars, but he ended up not using it. I ran out of my Murad retinol serum, so I gave this a try. I actually like it better than the Murad! It absorbs quickly, with zero smell or irritation. As with any retinol product, be sure to wear sunscreen when you're going to be outside."" —C. Munsterman Get it from Amazon for $18.68. 2. E.l.f. Halo Glow Liquid Filter that reviewers say is comparable to (or even better than) Charlotte Tilbury's famous Flawless Filter. Apply this as a luminous, blurring base, mix it with your moisturizer or foundation, or dot it over makeup as a natural-looking highlight. It's formulated with hyaluronic acid and squalene for a boost of hydration too! Promising review: ""This stuff is so legit I've gone through three bottles. Adds the perfect glow to your skin! Sometimes I use it under foundation, and sometimes, I use it solo with a bit of concealer. I will never not repurchase it for the price and how beautifully it sits on the skin. This stuff is viral for a reason!!"" —mapagill Promising review: ""If you like Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Filter, this is leaps and bounds better! Just buy it. The coverage is better and makes my skin have the most amazing natural glow! The colors run with a more warm/yellow undertone, which worked great for me! Spend a fraction of the price and just get it; you will be happy you did!"" —Amazonreview Get it from Amazon for $14 (available in 12 shades). 3. And their Halo Glow Beauty Wand, a buildable liquid highlighter formula that delivers a majorly radiant, lit-from-within finish to your skin without lots of glitter (like Charlotte Tilbury's highlighter blush wands). The cushion-tip applicator is super easy to apply, too! One reviewer says it's an alternative to the Charlotte Tilbury highlighters! Promising review: ""We saw this highlighter in a makeup tutorial video online and thought we would try it. It was an easy decision to purchase it because the price was relatively low compared to other highlighters. It is worth every penny and more! I've seen this shade applied on different skin tones and it looks beautiful on everyone! Just the right shimmer, not glitter. It's gorgeous!"" —Joyinmyheart Get it from Amazon for $9 (available in three shades). E.l.f. also has reviewer-loved glowy blush and contour shades in the same wand design!..."

"" if it had a human form. If you dread summer because you love wearing makeup but the heat and humidity leave it looking patchy, this'll lock it in with a smooth, semi-matte finish. Your oily T-zone doesn't know what's coming for it. One reviewer compares this to a $59 Givenchy powder! Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""This is the secret for makeup in hot and humid climates! I am a sweaty person, but I also love wearing makeup regardless of the weather. While holidaying in Southeast Asia at the start of wet season, I faced temperatures between 35 and 40 degrees Celsius (95–104 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity. After finishing my base makeup, I applied this powder all over. I did not use a setting spray because most break me out. Luckily, no setting spray was necessary while using this setting powder! It kept my foundation and cream blush from separating or becoming patchy, and also kept me from being too shiny. I reapplied a couple of times per day. This is magical and I will definitely be using regularly during the summers in North America too!"" —Sara Lima Get it from Amazon for $25. 2. A smocked midi dress because Hill House's Nap Dress is truly ~dreamy~ but your bank account is like, ""Um, we still need to buy groceries."" This cutie's a fraction of the cost and just as gorgeous, not to mention breathable as heck thanks to its 100% organic cotton poplin fabric. Prepare to fall head over heels for this dress — I definitely did. I recently wore this dress (in shade Lipstick Pink) to an outdoor wedding and I. AM. OBSESSED. It hugs my frame beautifully with the stretchy smocked waist — I can even get away with not wearing a bra, though for context I'm a B cup — and the flowy bottom of the dress sits just right. I personally haven't tried Hill House's Nap Dress (I drool over the designs, but $178 is a little too steep for me), but I'm perfectly happy to stock up on this dress in a few colors for around the same price. My colleague Heather Braga, on the other hand, is a Hill House devotee — but even she was impressed by this cheaper option: ""Listen, I am the proud owner of NINE Hill House Nap Dresses. I condone splurging on them (truly, by all means) and will be the first to tell you they are worth every penny. That being said, I tried out one of these from Quince and LOVE it. I have the Tribeca Stripe pattern and cannot believe how similar it feels to the other brand. It's my current go-to style for my frame (two kids in two years, send prayers) and is one of the few things I know I can throw on and KNOW I look great. Will definitely add another to an upcoming order and have been shouting from the rooftops how wonderful this brand fits."" Get it from Quince for $69.90 (available in sizes XS–XL and nine styles). 3. E.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen if you're still trying to find a daily sunscreen you don't despise. This clear gel sunscreen offers SPF 35 and goes on so smooth and lightweight, you'll immediately forget you're wearing it — no white cast here, folks. It doubles as a blurring primer, so it's great for wearing under makeup too! If you love Supergoop but the price is becoming hard to swallow...may I suggest trying this, because it's *very* similar. The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop's cult-fave product end. I've tried both, and I honestly prefer this E.l.f. version. Supergoop's had a slight graininess to it that I didn't love, while this E.l.f. sunscreen is exactly what I'd hoped Supergoop's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top!..."

I read the reviews, and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice, but both times I was outside and untouched. Delivery was very quick, so that was a plus.

I have horrific allergic reactions to mosquito bites. We're talking bumps swelling to the width of softballs within minutes of the bite. This tool doesn't make those bumps go away, but it stops the itch IMMEDIATELY. I was a huge skeptic; how could a little suction cure this agonizingly itchy allergic reaction? I'll be honest. I still really don't know how it does, but it provides instant relief that no pill, cream, or injection ever has ever achieved for me.

mov_26219C52B930810F9A84AA21D33B1DEB,2025-07-08 01:22:53,en,WEB,"  For Austin-based drag king , the hardest part of participating in was having to keep it secret for so long. ” It was a literal life-changing experience, and then I had to come back home to Austin, Texas, and pretend like nothing happened,” he tells PRIDE with a laugh. “Just be like, 'oh, my drag didn't change. Let me just keep doing the stuff I've been doing.'” Now he's a king unleashed, and Bat City better get ready for the new Alexander. “My drag has already gone on such a journey of gender expansiveness and helping people understand that masculinity can be soft, flamboyant, effeminate, whatever, and still be masculine,” he explains, adding he has his new drag brothers to thank for his growth. “Seeing my cast mates, like my mind was just blown open… every single person just expanded the possibilities for me for drag. I feel like I learned something from every single person.” As always, some of the most moving and eye-opening moments on the show itself were in the interactions between the kings. This week saw the E.L.F. Cosmetics weenie challenge take a surprisingly emotional turn. It highlighted the ways in which makeup can be particularly fraught for kings. “Everyone on the cast definitely has a different relationship [with makeup], and mine has certainly evolved with time,” says Alexander. “In the early days...I would do my little eyeliner beard and fill in my brows. But I didn't want to play too much more with that, because I was trying to emulate masculinity.” Jesse Grant/ for Revry Alexander the Great attends the ""King of Drag"" S1 Premiere hosted by LGBTQ+ Streaming Network Revry at Beaches Tropicana on June 22, 2025 in West Hollywood, California. But that changed for the king during the pandemic, when, like so many who found themselves isolated at home, he found themselves on a journey of self-discovery. “I was able to just be at home and play with a lot of different versions of my mug and elevate. I experienced this kind of, like leveling up, this expansion, where I was like, wait a minute, even when I was...socialized as a female growing up, I never used makeup inway. I never used makeup to this extreme. I never contoured, I never highlighted. So once I realized that I would never have used makeup in this way, it became empowering again.” It was another moment that really illuminated the close bonds the cast formed, both on and off set, that allow for the kinds of raw and real conversations we see in the Man Cave. Off set, the vibes are a bit sillier, whether that was late night bonding seshes's with his hotel roommate Dick Von Dyke, who Alexander joked really impressed him with his ability to fall asleep mid conversation. “We would be talking, and then [he] would kind of go silent, and I would look over, and he'd be passed out, unconscious. And that was like, well, was enjoying our conversation,” laughs Alexander. But it was the Tuna Can Van, that really brought the eliminated kings (EKs as they called themselves) together. What is the Tuna Can Van? Well, it's the van that rented to cheer each of his fellow eliminated kings up after they left the competition. “Tuna is literally a saint,” Alexander gushes. “Let me tell you, I prepared my package backwards. I thought I was going to the finale. I spent a long time working on my stuff for the finale. So, when I got eliminated, I was like ! But Tuna was waiting for us back at the hotel, with snacks and goodies. And the next day took us to, like, Santa Monica. We drove around listening to 'Pink Pony Club,'” he recalls. “Tuna made it just like so special, and I love him forever for that.” Jesse Grant/ for Revry Tuna Melt, Charles Galin King, King Molasses, Dick Von Dyke, Pressure K, Buck Wylde, King Perka $exxx, Big D, Alexander the Great and Henlo Bullfrog attend the ""King of Drag"" S1 Premiere. Sadly, this week saw Alexander, along with Pressure K, leaving the competition in a shocking double elimination after the horror challenge. For it, the kings were tasked with bringing their worst fear to the stage, and for environmental activist Alexander, nothing is more terrifying than ecocide. “I'm sorry, I won the horror challenge. There is nothing more horrifying than all of us dying on the planet because of ecocide,” he says with a laugh. He went against the grain aesthetically for a horror challenge, with a brightly colored cape and bodysuit, but every detail was intentional. “That costume was all recycled materials, fabric, a bodysuit I already had, and everything else was, yeah, a labor of love,” says Alexander. The episode, and his choice of horror, hit a little harder this week, following the passage of the Trump administration's “Big Beautiful Bill,” which the Sierra Club has called “.” But Alexander still has hope for the future of the planet. “I feel like anyone could get lost in the abyss forever, you know? And that just goes with the state of the world in general right now,” he admits...."

Credit: The Nightly/Will Pearce Kim Kardashian launched Skims, her shapewear brand, in 2019 after spending years dabbing other undergarments with teabags to “nail the perfect nude shade”. “It's deeply personal to me,” says the reality-television star. It has also been tremendously lucrative. Skims now makes some $US1 billion ($1.5b) in sales a year. From fizzy drinks and footwear to fragrances, over the years celebrities have peddled them all. In the past, most stars were happy simply lending their faces to ad campaigns in return for a bit of extra pocket money. Sign up to The Nightly's newsletters.

A few more entrepreneurial ones went a step further, involving themselves in the design of the products they endorsed. In the 1980s a chance encounter on an aeroplane between Jane Birkin, a British actress, and a senior executive at Hermès, a luxury brand, led to the creation of the Birkin bag. Around the same time Michael Jordan, a basketball star, teamed up with Nike, a sports brand, to launch the Air Jordan line of trainers. More recently, however, a growing number of celebrities have opted to build consumer enterprises of their own. Over the past decade or so, A-listers from Beyoncé and Rihanna to George Clooney and Harry Styles have launched beauty ranges, booze brands, fashion labels and more. A study in 2023 by JLL, a property firm, found that around three-fifths of celebrity retail brands in America had been founded in the preceding six years. Hailey Bieber launches skincare lipbalm for her brand Rhode Credit: Hailey Bieber/Instagram Since then the trend has continued apace, with stars from Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (men's skincare) and Emma Watson (gin) to Sir David Beckham (supplements) and Wiz Khalifa (mushroom-growing kits) all taking part. In May Hailey Bieber, wife of Justin Bieber, a pop star, sold her make-up brand Rhode to e.l.f. Beauty, a cosmetics firm, for as much as $1b. As the boundary between retail and social media blurs, celebrities are reshaping the world of consumer goods. The proliferation of celebrity brands is partly a reflection of changes in the media industry. In decades past, the business of communicating with consumers was largely intermediated by a handful of television channels, radio stations and print publications. No more. These days, says Douglas Holt, a marketing guru, every social-media account is a channel of its own. That has allowed celebrities to engage directly with their fans. Ms Kardashian has over 350m followers on Instagram. She frequently wears and talks about Skims online. “Kim is a phenomenal creative director,” says Jens Grede, her co-founder, “but she's also a one-woman media powerhouse.” According to Launchmetrics, an analytics firm, Skims last year generated more than $US600m in “media impact value”, a gauge of the monetary benefit of online posts, press coverage and other media exposure. That was eight times as much as for Spanx, a rival shapewear brand. Not only are celebrities now able to communicate directly with their fans. They can sell directly to them, too. Fledgling brands no longer need to sell via big retailers, who take a cut of profits, or to open physical stores, which involves enormous upfront investment. To sell online, they do not even need to go through e-commerce platforms like Amazon. Tools such as those offered by Shopify, a Canadian software firm, have made it easier than ever to build an e-commerce site or mobile app. Social-media platforms such as TikTok now allow brands to sell directly to users, too. Direct-to-consumer sales have risen to account for around one-seventh of e-commerce globally, according to NIQ, a data provider. Anita Balchandani of McKinsey, a consultancy, reckons they make up as much as 100 per cent of revenue in the early days of a typical celebrity brand, dropping to 30-60 per cent as firms expand and add third-party distribution. Of course, not every celebrity brand takes off. The Honest Company, a maker of baby and beauty products co-founded by Jessica Alba, an actress, has lost three-quarters of its market value since listing its shares in 2021. Alex Griffin, marketing chief for On, a sportswear brand worn by tennis player Roger Federer and actress Zendaya, says there is a reason many stars still opt for endorsements instead of starting their own brands: “It's not that easy.” Picking the right type of product matters. Clothes and booze are things people often buy for what they symbolise, rather than their functionality, says Sandra Cariglio of ReD Associates, an advisory firm. That makes them safer bets for celebrities. Attractive stars may naturally find it easy to sell beauty products, too. It helps that the production of cosmetics is easy to outsource to white-label manufacturers, as it is for fragrances. Jill Avery of Harvard Business School adds that products need to “fit” the celebrity's own brand. Fans buy make-up from Ms Bieber because she has long shared beauty tips online, and shapewear from Ms Kardashian because she is known for her curves. Asked why he is launching a running app, Mo Farah, an athlete with four Olympic gold medals to his name, says simply: “That's all I know.”..."

Between filming fun movies like Jurassic World Rebirth and making history on the set of Saturday Night Live, she's juggling behind the scenes work on The Outset, her very own skincare line, and, spoiler, doing some Amazon shopping along the way. “I'm definitely a Prime member,” Johansson tells PEOPLE. “It's my go-to for everything from batteries to kids' snacks to random home essentials.” Ahead of Amazon Prime Day, we caught up with the actress to get details on all of the best The Outset products, as well as learn a little more about the things she buys when no one's watching. The Outset Deals to Shop During Amazon Prime Day The Outset Firming Vegan Collagen Prep Serum Amazon “I always say if I were stranded on a desert island, I'd need our Firming Prep Serum with me. It's really the backbone of my routine,” she tells PEOPLE. “[It's] super lightweight, absorbs instantly, and makes my skin feel balanced and hydrated. I use it morning and night without fail.” The under-$50 product contains Hyaluroset, the brand's better-than-hyaluronic acid hydrating ingredient and, contrary to its name, does more than just firm the skin. The fragrance-free product will also save you money on additional brightening and plumping products, since it does that, too. The Outset Botanical Barrier Rescue Balm Amazon The actress is not, in fact, on a stranded island, so she can have all the products with her whenever, wherever. The Botanical Barrier Rescue Balm is the one she never leaves home without. “It does everything — I use it to tame flyaways, moisturize cuticles, hydrate my lips… it's a true multitasker, and I reapply it multiple times a day,” she tells PEOPLE. The Outset Gentle Micellar Antioxidant Cleanser Amazon So you don't have time to do a skincare routine? “I get it,” says Johansson. “I have two kids, a production schedule, and a skincare line to run, so time is precious.” But those who relate should try the brand's Daily Essentials 3-Step Regimen. It includes this cleanser and her stranded-on-an-island-serum above. Plus, it's fast! “I've timed it,” she adds. “It takes me about 2 minutes and 36 seconds on the dot.” The Outset Squalane Daily Moisturizer Amazon The Squalane Daily Moisturizer is the third and final step of the beginner-friendly routine, which her friends and family are all fond of, and one that “really sets up your skin for success,” she adds. The Outset Lip Oasis Glossy Treatment Amazon The Lip Oasis Glossy Treatment is another popular pick among her loved ones and shoppers alike. The shiny lip treatment has sold out at least five times and racked up a 1,000+ person waitlist. It's said to give you “glass lips,” per the brand — which I can confirm. I was sent the product to try, and my lips quickly got the Cinderella-like effect. E.l.f. Cosmetics Wow Brow Gel Amazon As for her beauty buys outside of The Outset, the actress is a fan of brow gel since “it's such a quick way to feel polished, even with no makeup on.” She also calls blotting papers and setting spray “lifesavers for long days or events.” We didn't get the intel on which brands she uses, but thankfully, Amazon has so many to choose from. Apple AirPods Max Wireless Over-Ear Headphones Amazon It doesn't stop there: “I've found so many great organizing tools for the house on Amazon — everything from drawer dividers to silicone snack bags. I also swear by portable chargers and noise-canceling headphones for travel days. Anything that helps streamline the chaos is a win.” Another win?..."
1ludsxs,2025-07-08 02:56:49,en,REDDIT,"  I turn red in the face and I'm struggling to cover it up properly and effectively. So, for some context as to how this began: I started a medication last Christmas and with every medication comes their side effects as most would know. I didn't know that my medication would stop me from sweating as it was always cold in the house because it was winter, but once it started getting warmer, my face would turn red often even from the littlest bit of warmth. And I know some might say that's normal and unavoidable, but I've never had it happen as often and as severe as this. In previous years, including last year, my cheeks were the only part on my face that would frequently turn red from warmth. Nowadays, my medication causes my face to turn red when I'm even just a little bit too warm. The only way to help battle the redness without makeup (and also because I'm literally too overheated to function) is to cool myself down with air conditioning because nothing else helps. The reason I'm making this post is because I have been struggling with makeup lately to help cover up my redness (oftentimes before it happens), especially when I'm leaving the house. I've never turned this red before, and even if I did, it was usually only on my cheeks, not my entire face like it is nowadays thanks to the medication… I have dry and sensitive skin, and not a lot of products have worked for me, but for a couple months now, I have been using Jason Wu's Tinted Moisturizer Meets CC Cream and it's been the best base makeup product I've used in years! I've also switched from putting the green shade from the NYX Color Corrector palette all over my face (exhausting because it takes forever to work into the skin) to recently using Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Color Correcting Concealer (because I use their normal Age Rewind Concealer and I've loved it since forever). I have also purchased the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer since someone I know recommended it for my situation, but I haven't tried it yet since I don't understand how it helps… And no, this post isn't just me rambling about my struggles with makeup. I'm here asking for help from those who may have experience with these products, this situation, or those who have professional makeup advice for me. There's a few issues I've been having with my makeup lately: 1. I've found that sometimes touching my face will take my tinted moisturizer right off, or if my nail presses ever so slightly onto my skin, that it'll remove the makeup in that exact area. I've tried to combat this by setting my face with the only setting powder I own, which is one from E.L.F. I just don't remember the name. I've only done this method once and it seemed to have helped but I'm unsure about how much it helped. 2. If I don't apply enough of my chosen colour corrector (remember, I still haven't tried the E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer yet) underneath my tinted moisturizer, then my redness will shine through later on and it makes me feel horrible about myself (I know many people have rosacea and other skin conditions that can cause mass redness, but I'm just remaining honest on how my type of redness makes me feel, so please don't take any offence as I don't mean any…). 3. To conclude this, I'm also heavily struggling with how to make this whole process simpler and less stress-inducing because I'm oftentimes trying to cover my redness before it actually appears, so I cannot tell how much green will help combat the red. Sometimes I've used too little and later my redness peeked through my makeup, or I've used too much and I've had to put on a lot of tinted moisturizer to cover it. It was also my first time using setting powder because I was scared it would cause me to dry out because of my skin type. I just need some advice… If anyone has any questions regarding what I mentioned, then please ask. I'd like to get some feedback and suggestions from anyone who is familiar with this or knows, professionally, how to help. I'm also on a tight budget as I barely make any money nowadays, so purchasing luxury beauty products or pricy items is something I'd very much like to avoid unless there's no other way. Sorry for this jumble of stuff. I've just been so frustrated lately and I've gotten very tired of spending a lot of time looking up how to help with these things and coming up with nothing, either because the advice found didn't help or wasn't the right solution to my problem. Thank you. ***TL;DR: I've been turning red in the face from a medication I take that stops me from sweating (meaning I cannot cool myself down). I'm struggling to both cover this up and maintain my makeup without it smudging off or rubbing off by a small tap to the face. Products mentioned: - Jason Wu's Tinted Moisturizer Meets CC Cream (my base product) - NYX Color Corrector Palette (used to use their green shade to cover my whole face) - Maybelline's Instant Age Rewind Color Correcting Concealer (currently use to cover the red underneath my tinted moisturizer) - E.L.F. Tone Adjusting Face Primer (bought as a suggestion from a friend but I haven't used it due to confusion on how it works)"

mov_79A661DC8BA2EC26E49A2ABA92F9599E,2025-07-08 16:12:59,en,WEB,"  Higher prices for a lot of popular products seem inevitable on our current trajectory. James Martin/CNET In many cases and for many products in the US, the biggest impacts of President Donald Trump's aggressive tariff plans haven't hit yet — but that could be about to change as the 90-day pause on the “reciprocal” tariffs is set to end this week. However things shake out, numerous companies have already hiked prices or said that they'll increase in the near-future — including, most recently, a popular and CNET-approved brand of smart lights. The fact of the matter is that tariffs — a tax placed on the importing of certain products into a country — will ultimately cause prices to go up, with Walmart characterizing these eventual price hikes as “inevitable” during its earnings call last month. Given Trump's push to place historically high tariffs on goods from almost every country in the world, you can also expect these price hikes to hit a huge variety of products. This truth has begun to sink in for a lot of Americans. About 64% of American adults are making tech purchases soon to avoid potential price hikes, according to CNET's most recent tariff sentiment survey. Around 51% of Americans adults also said that they already bought or plan to buy a personal tech device — such as a smartphone, laptop or tablet — soon. To help you keep score, I've put together a list of all the companies that have either confirmed or warned of price hikes due to Trump's tariffs. As other companies make such announcements, you can expect new names to be added here. Continue on for all those details, and for more, find out why it's best if you wait on buying a new iPhone. One item you won't find on this list yet? The original Nintendo Switch, which will see a currently unspecified price hike on Aug. 1, but only in Canada for the time being. If that increase makes its way south of the border, we'll let you know. Best Buy Without getting into specifics, Best Buy CEO Corie Barry told the Wall Street Journal late last month that it has already raised prices on certain products as part of its response to the tariffs. e.l.f. Known as an affordable option in the beauty world, e.l.f. announced in late May that it would be implementing a $1 price hike across its product line in response to the tariffs. CEO Tarang Amin claimed that the reaction from customers was positive, on account of the company's transparency. “We're not trying to pull anything over on anyone,” Amin told Fortune. “This is exactly what we're facing, and they understand.” Macy's Speaking to CNBC in late May, Macy's CEO Tony Spring said that price hikes will be implemented on some products due to tariffs, while also emphasizing that other tactics — like discontinuing certain products altogether — will also be a response to rising costs. Mattel Known for brands like Barbie and Hot Wheels, Mattel sounded the alarm over likely price increases during an early May earnings call. While it's unclear how much the toymaker's prices have increased since then, the company told investors that it would be, “where necessary, taking pricing action in its US business,” or to put it plainly, raising prices for consumers to mitigate the impact of tariffs. Nikon Camera-maker Nikon will introduce price hikes in response to Trump's tariffs, effective June 23. This move will only target lenses and accessories the company makes and sells, so the cameras themselves are safe for now. “We will be carefully monitoring any tariff developments and may adjust pricing as necessary to reflect the evolving market conditions,” a statement from Nikon explained. “We wish to thank our customers for their understanding and know that we are taking every possible step to minimize the impact on our community.” Philips Hue Parent company Signify announced that prices for its popular and highly regarded Philips Hue brand of smart lights will see price hikes effective July 1. The company also confirmed that this decision was made “as a direct result of tariffs.” “Signify reserves the right to modify prices based on new or additional tariffs becoming effective in the future,” the company's official statement explained. Ralph Lauren Sales at the luxury goods retailer Ralph Lauren have apparently remained steady amid recent uncertainty, but the company is still forging ahead with a plan to combat tariff impacts by raising prices more than it had already intended to, according to the Wall Street Journal. Shein and Temu Trump's tariffs have made a notable target of China, hitting the country with a 30% rate only after initially hiking it all the way to 145%. Online retailers like Shein and Temu rely on direct shipments from markets like China in order to offer the rock-bottom prices that made them famous, so it's little surprise now that they've had to raise prices. The Trump administration has furthered the issues faced by these companies by doing away with a rule known as the “de minimus” exception, which used to exclude smaller purchases under $800 from import taxes. With that rule gone, Trump's China tariffs will now apply to both bulk orders of industrial building materials and those shoes you've been looking to buy from Shein. Subaru Subaru has hiked prices across almost its entire line. The increase ranged from $750 to $2,055, depending on the model, with only the EV Solterra avoiding any change. As has become a trend with some companies, Subaru avoided attributing the price hikes to Trump's tariffs, citing only the common refrain of “market conditions.” Trump has notably disparaged companies that explicitly lay the blame for price hikes on his policies. “The changes were made to offset increased costs while maintaining a solid value proposition for the customer. Subaru pricing is not based on the country of origin of its products,” a Subaru spokesperson said in a statement to Car & Driver...."

mov_2772BA8226CF395470239914A63E9D8D,2025-07-09 01:00:52,en,WEB,"  Last week's episode of saw Pressure K leaving alongside Alexander the Great in a heartbreaking double elimination. While every episode thus far in this inaugural season of the groundbreaking series has delivered on both laughs and heartfelt moments (truly, this show is of drag), this week's hit even harder. This time, the challenge was all about tapping into and embodying the competitors' deepest fears, and what that meant for many of the kings was unpacking their trauma and opening up some of their most vulnerable sides to the world. Leading the charge in that regard was . The comic and pride of the Atlanta king community opened up in ways that neither the kings, the audience, the judges, but most of all ever expected (Pressure K uses he/him pronouns in drag, and she/her off stage). It began with the weenie challenge, in which the kings were tasked with creating a dual makeup look, one side of their face being beautiful and the other monstrous, using e.l.f. Cosmetics. It proved to be an emotional challenge for Pressure K, who revealed a traumatic experience and relationship with makeup. “I came home to makeup,” he shared with his fellow kings. A loaded statement that only becomes more harrowing when you hear the story behind it. Courtesy of Pressure K “My mother felt like she needed to teach me how to be a woman,” Pressure recalls to PRIDE. “So I was, like, legit taking classes. ' This is what a woman does.' Or like, if I do something, 'what you did is wrong, this is what you're supposed to do.' [It] got to a point where I felt like feminine activities became a punishment.” As a result of some perceived deviation from prescribed womanhood, one day in her teens, Pressure came home one day to find someone waiting for her. “I'm not exactly sure what I did. I might have, like, wore a hat, or they might have caught me in baggy clothes. I might have made an aggressive move, and I came home to the Mary Kay party,” she recalls. While Pressure put on a happy face, one she says her mother had trained her to adopt growing up, “I knew how to like...” Pressure says while demonstrating a happy expression. “People think I'm built for the camera. Really it's my trauma of my mother turning me on, and turning me off.” As the makeup demonstration went on, Pressure became increasingly convinced it was evidence that she was unacceptable and unlovable. “They made me feel like I needed to cover up, like what I had was wrong, like my complexion was wrong,” she recalls. “The more makeup I put on, the more I didn't look like myself. And I took it as my mother thinks I'm ugly, like I have to cover this up.” From then on, Pressure's relationship with makeup was fraught, to say the least. That was until a chance encounter with one of her castmates, Perka $exx, changed everything for her — by watching the drag king perform in a full face of makeup and expressing a kind of freedom that Pressure craved. Matt Shaw “Back in the day, we had drag kings, but we didn't call it drag. We just, like, sing a song so you can get the girl at the club, like it wasn't a thing,” says Pressure. But then Perka took to the stage. “The way Perka moved and the art [of] his makeup... it wasn't that he was trying to be like, 'I'm ugly, I need to cover up.' It was like he was pushing the art out,” explains Pressure. “I was like, that's it. I don't know exactly what it is, but I need to know what that is, because it was just an aura of freedom that was coming off of him.” It would be a while before Pressure fully realized that “aura of freedom” for herself, but it happened one night when heartbreak over splitting from her mentor led her to perform her rawest number yet. “I was just so heartbroken. And I was listening to gospel at the time, and it was just like every time I heard it, I would just cry, like every time I just it,” so at an event called Mug Check, Pressure brought that energy to the stage. “[I put on] the most regular outfit: black button down, black pants with a robe, like the choir robe,” she recounts. “Everything started at the stairs and came down and had a whole choir behind me, and I just remember, like I looked up... and I felt that freedom that Perka had.” “It felt bigger than me. Felt bigger than the pain. It was my freedom,” she says. “It was the first time I felt like I was able to breathe since me and my wife got married.” When asked if drag is how they bypass some of the trauma when those old patterns of emotional repression arise, Pressure K is adamant, “Yes, it's the cheat code,” she says. Pressure had a similar revelation this week during the horror challenge that saw the king donning a robe again, this time with words emblazoned on it that represented all the dark influences that surround him. “This challenge was triggering,” Pressure says with a laugh. “I thought it was one thing, but it really was deeper.” Scott Youngblood..."

mov_9925F8250E1287A5C521B9A0A91FFA07,2025-07-09 06:06:05,zh-tw,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[zh-tw]韓流帝王SUPER JUNIOR帶著第十二張正規專輯《Super Junior25》回歸，與台灣粉絲共創許多美好回憶的他們，這次也不忘向台灣E.L.F.問候，九位成員特別各自傳達真心，先由東海、銀赫、始源、圭賢、利特的「我很想你」、「老婆」、「謝謝大家」、「一直支持SUPER JUNIOR」、「我愛你們」一人一句中文接力打頭陣，希澈道出「十年了啊」的感嘆，藝聲突如其來的「救命啊」逗笑大家，最後厲旭和神童向粉絲致上感謝之意。 此次是繼2022年12月發行的第十一張正規專輯Vol.2《The Road Celebration》後，時隔約2年8個月的專輯，同時也是為了紀念團體出道20周年而發行，以此回顧歷程、展望未來。 專輯名稱延續出道作《Super Junior05》的命名脈絡，還是由成員發想而訂定，更增添特別意義。 專輯一發行便登上17個地區iTunes專輯排行榜冠軍。 成員表示這張並不是單純的專輯而已，更想把一起走過的二十年的時間，和其中發生過的故事傳給下一個世代，希望這段旅程能成為某些人在起點上的小小勇氣或希望，也想帶給後輩們「這樣堅持著、真心去做的話，是可能的」這樣的好先例。 而出道二十年來對SUPER JUNIOR來說變化最大和依然不變的部分，希澈表示變化最大的是自己的外貌，為了此次專輯很努力的減肥與控制飲食，不變的則是利特和銀赫的童顏與體重，看著兩人能獲得很大的激勵；藝聲覺得不變的是精神年齡，成員們至今仍像二十多歲的人；東海則感性表示變化最大的部分是成員對守護SUPER JUNIOR這個組合的心意更深了，不變的是對粉絲E.L.F.的心意和愛意。 主打歌〈Express Mode〉是一首節奏明快、充滿能量的俱樂部風格的舞曲，結合極具動感的節奏與令人上癮的副歌旋律。 歌詞中傳遞出不滿足於當下，持續朝下個目標邁進的熱血態度。 神童介紹道「我們一直都在嘗試新事物嘛，這次真的苦惱很久，但一聽到〈Express Mode〉，大家馬上就覺得是這個了，這首歌曲有如SUPER JUNIOR般的活力與風趣，還有最近的感性，一聽就有主打歌的感覺」。 銀赫補充表示「既有不安於現狀、未來也會持續向前的意義，音樂和表演部分也能很好地將我們展現出來」。 為紀念專輯發行，回歸當天SUPER JUNIOR進行了倒數直播和線上Showcase與粉絲同樂。 尤其在Showcase中首次公開主打歌〈Express Mode〉和收錄曲〈Haircut〉、〈我們的花語 (Stuck With You)〉的舞台，還表演了經典歌曲〈U〉、〈SORRY, SORRY〉與〈So I〉，勁歌熱舞的帥氣模樣使人目不轉睛，其中〈SORRY, SORRY〉的舞台，希澈的solo爵士鼓秀時隔多年再度重現，令粉絲們大呼感動。 《Super Junior25》已在台數位發行。 看更多 CTWANT 文章"

18067002974472787,2025-07-09 08:57:21,de,INSTAGRAM,"  Prämieneinnahme 63 $ (abzgl. 0,81 $ Handelskosten) Keine Anlageberatung! Servus miteinander, zur Zeit nehme ich gerne den Basiswert e.l.f. Beauty💄 für meine Optionstrades zur Hand. Erst kürzlich wurde mitgeteilt, das sich das Kosmetikunternehmen mit der Marke „Rhode“ von Hailey Bieber verstärken will. Dies sehe ich als hervorragenden strategischen Schritt an, da die Marke „Rhode“ in kürzester Zeit ziemlich erfolgreich wurde. 👉Nun Infos zum Trade: Mit diesem Trade würde ich 100 Aktien von e.l.f. Beauty abnehmen, sofern sich der Kurs nach Ende der Laufzeit am 15.08. unter 75 $ befinden sollte. Sollte der Kurs bspw. bei 65 $ nach Laufzeitende notieren, müsste ich für die 100 Aktien, die mir dann eingebucht werden, 75 $ je Aktie bezahlen. Diese Vorgehensweise nennt man auch „Handel eines Cash Secured Puts (CSP), da das Geld (7.500 $) auch vorhanden ist und die Abnahme der Aktien deckt. Ich versuche allerdings, den Trade noch vor Laufzeitende im Gewinn 🥇 zu schließen. Je näher das Laufzeitende kommt, desto günstiger wird i. d. R. der Rückkauf und somit das Schließen/Glattstellen der Option! Aber falls die Volatilität während der Laufzeit massiv ansteigen sollte, kann es auch sein, dass ein vorzeitiger Rückkauf der Option im Verlust endet. Schauen wir mal, ich halte dich auf dem Laufenden, falls ich hier Änderungen vornehme. Auf jeden Fall habe ich zum Strikepreis von 75 $ ca. 35 % Luft 👍🏽(aktueller Kurs ca. 117 $). Wenn du mehr hierüber erfahren möchtest folge mir gerne oder stelle mir deine Fragen in den Kommentaren oder per DM. 🙏🏽 Mach´s gut und viele renditestarke Grüße von Aktien & MEHR(wert) 🎯Disclaimer: KEINE Anlageberatung!

mov_A2D8CC736AC52E156E7FA42BBFC11DC4,2025-07-09 10:03:00,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Las estrellas usan su fama para crear prósperos negocios, según el semanario británico. Desde bebidas gaseosas y calzado hasta fragancias, a lo largo de los años los famosos han vendido de todo. En el pasado, la mayoría de las estrellas se conformaban con prestar sus rostros a campañas publicitarias a cambio de un poco de dinero extra. Algunos más emprendedores fueron un paso más allá y participaban en el diseño de los productos que promocionaban. En los años 80, un encuentro casual en un avión entre Jane Birkin, actriz británica, y un alto ejecutivo de Hermès, una marca de lujo, dio lugar a la creación del bolso Birkin. Por la misma época, Michael Jordan, la estrella del basquetbol, se asoció con Nike, una marca deportiva, para lanzar la línea de zapatillas deportivas Air Jordan. Sin embargo, más recientemente un número creciente de famosos ha optado por crear empresas de consumo propias. En la última década, los famosos, desde Beyoncé y Rihanna hasta George Clooney y Harry Styles, han lanzado líneas de belleza, marcas de bebidas alcohólicas, de ropa y mucho más. Un estudio realizado en 2023 por la empresa inmobiliaria JLL reveló que alrededor de tres quintas partes de las marcas minoristas de famosos en Estados Unidos se habían fundado en los seis años anteriores. Desde entonces, la tendencia ha continuado a buen ritmo, con la participación de estrellas como Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson (cuidado de la piel masculina) y Emma Watson (ginebra), sir David Beckham (suplementos) y Wiz Khalifa (kits para cultivar setas). En mayo, Hailey Bieber, esposa de Justin Bieber, estrella del pop, vendió su marca de maquillaje Rhode a la firma de cosméticos e.l.f. Beauty por nada menos que US$ 1,000 millones. A medida que se difumina la frontera entre el comercio minorista y las redes sociales, los famosos están remodelando el mundo de los bienes de consumo. La proliferación de marcas de famosos es en parte un reflejo de los cambios en la industria de los medios de comunicación. En décadas pasadas, comunicarse con los consumidores estaba intermediado en gran medida por un puñado de canales de televisión, emisoras de radio y publicaciones impresas. Ya no. Hoy en día, dice Douglas Holt, un gurú de la mercadotecnia, cada cuenta de las redes sociales es un canal propio. Esto ha permitido a los famosos relacionarse directamente con sus fans. Kim Kardashian tiene más de 350 millones de seguidores en Instagram. A menudo usa Skims y habla de ellos en línea. “Kim es una directora creativa fenomenal”, dice Jens Grede, su cofundador, “pero también es una potencia mediática en solitario”. Según Launchmetrics, una empresa de análisis, el año pasado Skims generó más de US$ 600 millones en “valor de impacto mediático”, un indicador del beneficio monetario de las publicaciones online, la cobertura de prensa y otros tipos de exposición mediática. Esta cifra es ocho veces superior a la de Spanx, una marca rival de ropa moldeadora. Ahora los famosos no solo pueden comunicarse directamente con sus admiradores. También pueden venderles directamente. Las marcas emergentes ya no necesitan vender a través de grandes minoristas, que se llevan una parte de los beneficios, ni abrir tiendas físicas, lo que supone una enorme inversión inicial. Para vender en línea, ni siquiera necesitan pasar por plataformas de comercio electrónico como Amazon. Las herramientas como las que ofrece Shopify, una empresa de software canadiense, han facilitado más que nunca la creación de un sitio de comercio electrónico o una aplicación móvil. Las plataformas de redes sociales como TikTok también permiten ahora a las marcas vender directamente a los usuarios. Las ventas directas al consumidor han aumentado hasta representar alrededor de una séptima parte del comercio electrónico mundial, según NIQ, un proveedor de datos. Anita Balchandani, de la consultora McKinsey, calcula que representan hasta el 100% de los ingresos en los primeros días de una marca típica de famosos, y que descienden al 30%-60% a medida que las empresas se expanden y añaden la distribución por terceros. Por supuesto, no todas las marcas de famosos despegan. The Honest Company, fabricante de productos de belleza y para bebés cofundada por la actriz Jessica Alba, ha perdido tres cuartas partes de su valor de mercado desde que cotizó en bolsa en 2021. Alex Griffin, jefe de mercadotecnia de On, una marca de ropa deportiva que visten el tenista Roger Federer y la actriz Zendaya, dice que hay una razón por la que muchas estrellas siguen optando por los patrocinios en lugar de crear sus propias marcas: “No es tan fácil”. Elegir el tipo de producto adecuado es importante. La ropa y la bebida son cosas que la gente suele comprar por lo que simbolizan, más que por su funcionalidad, dice Sandra Cariglio, de ReD Associates, una empresa de asesoría. Eso los convierte en apuestas más seguras para los famosos. Naturalmente, a las estrellas atractivas también les resulta fácil vender productos de belleza. Ayuda que la producción de cosméticos sea fácil de subcontratar a fabricantes de marca blanca, como ocurre con las fragancias. Jill Avery, de la Harvard Business School, añade que los productos tienen que “encajar” con la propia marca del famoso. Las fans compran maquillaje a Hailey Bieber porque lleva mucho tiempo compartiendo consejos de belleza en Internet, y ropa moldeadora a Kim Kardashian porque es conocida por sus curvas. Cuando se le pregunta por qué lanza una aplicación para correr, Mo Farah, atleta con cuatro medallas de oro olímpicas a sus espaldas, dice sencillamente a The Economist: “Es lo único que sé”. Aun así, algunos famosos parecen capaces de vender cualquier cosa. Ryan Reynolds, estrella de comedias románticas convertido en superhéroe malhablado, se convirtió en 2019 en el rostro de Mint Mobile, una empresa de telecomunicaciones, tras adquirir alrededor del 25% del negocio. El año pasado, T-Mobile, un rival mayor, compró la empresa matriz de Mint por unos US$ 1,300 millones. En 2021, Reynolds se hizo con el Wrexham A.F.C., un equipo de fútbol galés en apuros, por 2 millones de libras (US$ 2.7 millones) junto con otro actor. La mejora en los resultados del equipo —y un documental ganador de un premio Emmy coproducido por Reynolds— han aumentado considerablemente su fama. Ahora se dice que el club está recaudando dinero con una valoración de hasta 350 millones de libras. Para los famosos que se dedican a los bienes de consumo, tener un producto decente es esencial. La atención en línea de la que gozan las marcas de famosos viene acompañada de un escrutinio añadido. Goop, una marca de estilo de vida fundada por Gwyneth Paltrow, actriz ganadora de un Oscar, ha sido atacada por hacer afirmaciones sin base científica sobre sus productos...."

「韓流帝王」SUPER JUNIOR帶著第十二張正規專輯《Super Junior25》回歸，此次是繼2022年12月發行的第十一張正規專輯Vol.2《The Road  Celebration》後，時隔約2年8個月的專輯，同時也是為了紀念團體出道20周年而發行，以此回顧歷程、展望未來。 專輯名稱延續出道作《Super Junior05》的命名脈絡，還是由成員發想而訂定，更增添特別意義。 成員表示這張並不是單純的專輯而已，更想把一起走過的二十年的時間，和其中發生過的故事傳給下一個世代，希望這段旅程能成為某些人在起點上的小小勇氣或希望，也想帶給後輩們“這樣堅持著、真心去做的話，是可能的”這樣的好先例。 而出道二十年來對SUPER JUNIOR來說變化最大和依然不變的部分，希澈表示變化最大的是自己的外貌，為了此次專輯很努力的減肥與控制飲食，不變的則是利特和銀赫的童顏與體重，看著兩人能獲得很大的激勵；藝聲覺得不變的是精神年齡，成員們至今仍像二十多歲的人；東海則感性表示變化最大的部分是成員對守護SUPER JUNIOR這個組合的心意更深了，不變的是對粉絲E.L.F.的心意和愛意。 ▲SUPER JUNIOR出道20周年。 （圖／SM Entertainment提供）
主打歌〈Express Mode〉是一首節奏明快、充滿能量的俱樂部風格的舞曲，結合極具動感的節奏與令人上癮的副歌旋律。 歌詞中傳遞出不滿足於當下，持續朝下個目標邁進的熱血態度。 神童介紹道「我們一直都在嘗試新事物嘛，這次真的苦惱很久，但一聽到〈Express Mode〉，大家馬上就覺得是這個了，這首歌曲有如SUPER JUNIOR般的活力與風趣，還有最近的感性，一聽就有主打歌的感覺」。 銀赫補充表示「既有不安於現狀、未來也會持續向前的意義，音樂和表演部分也能很好地將我們展現出來」。 為紀念專輯發行，回歸當天SUPER JUNIOR進行了倒數直播和線上Showcase與粉絲同樂。 尤其在Showcase中首次公開主打歌〈Express Mode〉和收錄曲〈Haircut〉、〈我們的花語 (Stuck With You)〉的舞台，還表演了經典歌曲〈U〉、〈SORRY, SORRY〉與〈So I〉，勁歌熱舞的帥氣模樣使人目不轉睛，其中〈SORRY, SORRY〉的舞台，希澈的solo爵士鼓秀時隔多年再度重現，令粉絲們大呼感動。 更多三立新聞網報導

The global eyelash serum market is projected to experience steady growth through 2032, fueled by rising consumer awareness around personal grooming, growing demand for cosmetic enhancements, and the strong influence of beauty trends on social media. Continued innovation in serum formulations featuring ingredients such as amino acids, peptides, and natural oils is also driving consumer interest and expanding product offerings.

One of the most prominent is the rising beauty consciousness among consumers. There is increasing awareness of aesthetics and personal grooming, especially among women.

Celebrities, influencers, and social media trends are also playing a key role in fueling interest in long, thick eyelashes. This directly influences the eyelash serum market growth, and the trend will likely persist in the coming years. Immediate Delivery Available | Buy This Premium Research Report: https://www.coherentmarketinsights.com/insight/buy-now/6881 Alternatives and Counterfeit Products Limiting Market Growth The future eyelash serum market outlook appears optimistic, owing to rising popularity of personal grooming trends. However, availability of alternatives and penetration of counterfeit products are significant barriers to widespread market expansion. Many consumers opt for alternative like eyelash extensions, mascaras, and false eyelashes for instant results. Adoption of these options may reduce eyelash serum market demand during the forecast period. Similarly, there is an increase in counterfeit products on e-commerce platforms. This can damage brand reputation as well as erode consumer trust, thereby negatively impacting eyelash serum market growth. Growing Preference for Non-Invasive Beauty Solutions Creating Growth Opportunities Modern consumers are increasingly seeking alternatives to eyelash extensions or surgeries. This puts eyelash serums into the limelight, offering a non-invasive, easy-to-apply, and cost-effective solution for enhancing lash growth. Thus, rising preference for non-invasive beauty solutions is expected to open new revenue-generation streams for eyelash serum manufacturers. Expansion of online shopping platforms and direct-to-consumer brands is making eyelash serums more accessible globally. Rising sales of eyelash serums through these online platforms will further boost market growth during the assessment period. Impact of AI on the Eyelash Serum Market Artificial Intelligence (AI) is making a notable impact on the eyelash serum market. It helps eyelash serum companies in product development, personalization, and marketing. AI-powered data analytics enable brands to analyze consumer feedback, usage patterns, and market trends. Similarly, AI tools like Ulta's GLAMlab let users preview beauty products, such as eyelash serums, boosting confidence and conversions. Emerging Eyelash Serum Market Trends Rising personalization trend is expected to trigger growth of the eyelash serum market during the assessment period. Top eyelash serum manufacturers are testing personalized serums to match individual needs as well as preferences. Increasing social media influence and celebrity endorsements is acting as a catalyst for market growth. Platforms like TikTok and Instagram play a crucial role in promoting eyelash serums through viral content, influencer reviews, and beauty tutorials. Ongoing product innovations are also contributing to expansion of the eyelash serum market. Leading brands are increasing using natural, vegan, and chemical-free ingredients to woo health-conscious and eco-aware consumers. Manufacturers of eyelash serums are also focusing on developing advanced serums enriched with biotin, peptides, and plant-based compounds for improved effectiveness. Similarly, they are shifting their preference towards using sustainable packaging and eco-friendly practices. Such innovations will positively impact eyelash serum sales growth in the coming years. Growing eyelash serum demand from the male grooming segment is expected to boost market growth. An increasing number of men are exploring eyelash and eyebrow products as part of their grooming routines...."

I'm still not a fan of the formula, but that color grew on me. I found the right brush and the right combination to make this color work for me (I mix it with a softer warm blush)~~ ✅ 80. ~~A product from a previous project pan - Kilo Milano Create Your Balance Soft Touch Lip&Cheek in Velvet Bliss - 10/10. ~~ (It's not my favorite product, but layering it with other lip products that have the same color range helped me to use it more) ✅ 61. ~~Something bright - NYX Buttermelt Blush in Butta Than Before - 5/5. ~~ (I tried as much as I could to make this shade work by using it in new ways and with different brushes -I didn't count those ""test"" usages - but I'd instead declutter it because it's too pigmented and the shade doesn't work for me) ✅ 55. ~~A spray - Nyx Dewy Finish Setting Spray  - 7/7. ~~ (I like it. The more I use it, the more I realize I don't like matte setting spray, so I'll repurchase it once it's done.) ✅ 32. ~~An eyeshadow - Glamshop Laser - 5/3.

I'll get a darker shade once I finish it. ~~ ✅ 16. ~~Something cool-toned - SEPHORA COLLECTION's About That Shine Sheer Shine Lipstick in Blinding Pink - 5/5 - I still find it too bright for an everyday look but it's easy to layer other products on top to tone down the color. ~~ ✅ 78. ~~A limited edition or discontinued product - Blend Bunny Forget Me Not palette - 10/10 - I fell in love again off this palette. I know it's one of the unpopular releases but I'm so glad I got my hands on it. I can use it for a wash of color on the eyes with the shimmer, for mapping the outline and fill in my brows, add warmth or cool to my face. ~~ ✅ ~~40. Something fun - By BEAUTY BAY Mini Charms Colour Palette - 10/10 - I'm still amazed by the fact that a palette of this quality is sold for just 12 euros. Although all the shimmers don't have the same wow effect, they exceeded my expectations because the swatches didn't do them justice, as far as I'm concerned. If it's still available, I really recommend getting one. ~~ **Ongoing:** ☑️ 34. A bronzer - e.l.f. Luminous Putty Bronzer in Sun Chaser - 5/10 ☑️ 66.

E.l.f.'s Hydrating Core Lip Shine in the ""Ecstatic"" shade, which reviewers say captures the some magic as ""Black Honey,"" the $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique that's blowing up on TikTok at a fraction of the price. It doesn't shift colors as magically as the other version, but it's a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lip. I personally will live, breathe, and die by the magic of $25 ""universal"" Black Honey version — it lasts FOREVER and also functions as the perfect blush — but it sells out so often that I am also deeply relieved to know it has a cheap alternative in case of lip emergency! Promising review: ""I absolutely love this product. The dark color is perfectly sheer. It also adds the most beautiful color to your lips. I am a Clinique Black Honey lip fan, and this gives me the same look for a fraction of the cost. I love it and have multiple that I keep in various spots. Not sticky either, which is my biggest gripe about lip glosses. My hair doesn't get stuck in this like some glosses, but I get the shine."" —Hamps5 Get it from Amazon for $6 (also available in four other shades). 2. A set of square stemmed wineglasses inspired by the iconic Crate & Barrel version, except these are durable as heck (good for particularly rowdy wine-and-cheese nights). Reviewers especially love these chic, understated glasses because they work well for red and white wines. Promising review: ""We've had four of these glasses for over six months now and finally just added four more to our collection. These glasses are SO CHIC and are very similar to ones sold at Crate & Barrel but are MUCH more durable. Unlike the C&B glasses, you can cheers without feeling like the glasses will break. In fact, they've tipped over in the sink a few times and are still intact. They dry beautifully, sparkle after the dishwasher and we get so many compliments on them. I love them!"" —Katie B Get a set of two from Amazon for $27.99. 3. L'Oréal Paris Makeup True Match Lumi Glotion designed to enhance your skin's natural ✨ glow✨ just like the pricy Drunk Elephant drops — perfect for anyone who wants a lightweight alternative to foundation or just a lil' extra low-effort, ethereal shimmer in their lives. Promising review: ""Love love love this stuff. This is such a stellar product that is so versatile. Can be worn alone to put some glowy life to skin. Add to foundation or layer it. Beautiful. Use it as a base where you put highlighter on top. Mix some with moisturizer. This, in my opinion, is better than so many high-luxury brands that make similar products. And I am pretty sure it can be used by all skin types. It's not an oily feeling at all, and it doesn't dry out the skin either. Just a total package. Can't beat the price either."" —Figgy08 Get it from Amazon for $13.98 (available in five shades). 4. Glossmetics' Lychee Overnight Lip Mask, a Laneige or Tatcha alternatve that's already a cult-fave in the making — you can wear this non-stick, ultra glossy lip shine during the day or overnight as a lip treatment to help hydrate, soften, and condition your lips. Not to mention you will taste *delectable* all day and night (just ask the many lychee martinis I have downed on this here earth!) . Promising review: ""I'm obsessed with lip products. I have tried everything you can imagine, inexpensive and expensive. This is my favorite lip product I've purchased. This gloss is incredible, perfectly moisturizing, and the color is so perfect, a very light natural glowy pink. I just came on Amazon to order a couple more to have one in the car, my purse, nightstand.""..."

Lawless's ""Forget The Filler"" in a variety of delectable flavors (birthday cake!!!) — it'll hydrate your lips overnight (similar to Laneige's repairing sleep mask) and make your pout fuller. It's made of shea butter, hyaluronic acid, and a stimulating peptide complex that work so magically together you won't ever want to run out. Promising review: ""Really makes a difference. First overnight treatment I've used where my lips genuinely feel hydrated and plumper in the morning. I'm pleasantly surprised — I bought this on a whim after a rec from The Strategist and almost canceled the order. Now I use it every night!"" —Hilary Get it from Amazon $22 (available in five flavors). 2. Clinique Almost Lipstick Tinted Lip Balm in Black Honey that has been *all the rage* on TikTok (which is how you know it's good). It's lightweight, has a touch of gloss to it, and the shade will have you saying ""mhmmmm, honey!"" from the second you apply it. BuzzFeed writer Emma Lord has personally tested this baby out. She said: ""I was very adamant about not buying this for the longest time because I am stubborn about ""expensive"" beauty products, but this is worth every penny and then some. It's so lightweight and layerable, it's foolproof to apply, and I have yet to wear a single outfit it doesn't complement??? I love watching it instantly elevate a casual look or add simple elegance to dressy ones. I wear it every day now, and after weeks of use, I've barely made a dent. Also, and maybe this is just me, but I tend to get pigment on my teeth with a lot of lip products, and I've simply never had an issue with this magic stick. Anyway, watch this TikTok of someone using it on their lips AND cheeks, because I did and oops, this lipstick FELL into my cart."" Get it from Amazon for $25 (available in two shades). 3. Sol De Janeiro Brazilian Bum Bum Cream featuring scent notes of vanilla, pistachio, and salted caramel you'll enjoy applying to your skin just as much as you'd like it as an ice cream sundae. It's also filled with vitamin E, caffeine, coconut oil, and guarana extract to help smooth, firm, and hydrate your skin. BuzzFeed editor Elizabeth Lilly says, ""I've used this stuff before and can confirm that 1) the scent is indeed intoxicating and 2) everything from this brand has scents that really STICK to you. I'm currently using the Beija Flor body wash and I can smell it on my skin hours later — which is pretty rare for a body wash."" Promising review: ""I am 60 and I could not get rid of the cellulite on my legs. I started using this product six weeks ago and can noticeably see a difference. I apply morning and evening, before bed for optimal results. It goes on smooth and has a creamy, nonsticky feel. The smell is dreamy, and even my husband has commented on the improvement. Make sure you apply in a circular motion for optimal coverage, absorption and circulation."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $24 (available in three sizes and in packs). 4. A motivating daily planner that literally says ""You've got this!"" at the top — it'll also look oh-so-cute on your desk or fridge and has sections to keep track of appointments, how much water you're drinking, a to-do list, what you ate (meal prep, perhaps?!) and a general notes/doodling area. Each pad comes with 50 sheets. Promising review: ""I use this first thing when I get in the office in the mornings as a 'personal to-do' before our morning meetings. It reminds me to stay productive when I might not have work to do in the office at that moment, but it also reminds me throughout the day of the intention I set early on. It's been a great visual reminder of my personal goals while I'm achieving professional goals."" —Chelsea Ashton Get it from Amazon for $5.99+ (available in five sizes and 17 styles). 5. Gradient tempered glass for your iPhone — it'll act as a privacy screen (sorry to the Nosy Nancy sitting next to you on the subway, they won't be able to see your texts to your mom), will help filter blue light, prevent your screen from scratching, and add a little bit of *~flair~* to your phone in the process. Psst: Read more about the effects of blue light and eye strain at UC Davis Health and the American Academy of Ophthalmology...."
mov_DC94EA846D6FCA5D7C6F8B6307A2776E,2025-07-10 11:15:00,en,WEB,"  Ulta Beauty's new chief executive officer Kecia Steelman continues to make significant moves, this time snapping up Space NK from investment firm Manzanita Capital. Terms of the deal were not disclosed apart from that the purchase was funded with cash on hand and capacity under Ulta's existing credit facility. More from WWD Press reports from last year suggested Manzanita was searching for a deal valued between 300 million pounds and 400 million pounds. Space NK, which has 83 stores in the U.K. and Ireland, will operate as a stand-alone subsidiary of Ulta Beauty and will continue to be led by its existing management team, including CEO Andy Lightfoot. “Today's announcement marks an exciting step forward for Ulta Beauty's global expansion efforts, adding the U.K. market to our existing planned openings in Mexico and the Middle East later this year,” said Steelman. “Space NK is a beloved brand with a strong operating model and customer loyalty, and we couldn't be more thrilled to welcome the brand into the Ulta Beauty family.” Space NK was founded in Covent Garden in 1993 by Nicky Kinnaird as a glossy destination for niche, international brands — many of them skin care — that were difficult to find in the U.K. It had been part of Manzanita Capital for 23 years. Reports that the firm was trying to sell Space NK emerged in April 2024. It previously tried to off-load it in 2018, before deciding to pull the retailer off the market. Bill Fisher, CEO and founder of Manzanita Capital, said: “I have every confidence that Ulta Beauty and this terrific management team will take Space NK to new heights.” Lightfoot added that he was excited by the opportunity to join Ulta Beauty and “benefit from its scale, brand relationships and resources.” “This acquisition sets both companies on a path to further success and importantly, enables us to reach more beauty enthusiasts throughout the world at scale. As a collective force of talented, passionate teams, I'm confident we will take Space NK to new heights,” he continued. The U.S. wholesale division of Space NK, which entails roughly 600 points of distribution across Bloomingdale's, Nordstrom, Nordstrom Rack, Hudson's Bay and the company's shop-in-shop collaboration with Walmart and Beauty SpaceNK, was acquired by PCA Companies in June 2024. Since taking the reins as CEO of Ulta at the beginning of this year, Steelman has been executing its international expansion. Later this year Ulta will debut in Mexico through a joint venture with Axo, before arriving in the Middle East via a licensing agreement with Alshaya Group. In the Middle East, the first locations will be in Dubai and Kuwait City, with one store in each location to begin with, although the strategy is to expand quickly. It's the same story in Mexico. “We're getting ready to launch in the back half of 2025 for Mexico, and it will probably be in the later half of the year for the Middle East. For Mexico, it's a joint venture with Axo. We're very excited about our partnership. The teams are working very well together. We believe we can get 10 stores open in a pretty short period of time,” Steelman said during an April interview with WWD. “In regards to the Middle East, that's actually a licensed agreement that we're doing with Alshaya Group. We've talked to Alshaya Group for quite some time, and feel like they're a fantastic partner for us to bring our brand to life in the Middle East.” Thursday's announcement that Ulta is acquiring Spake NK is yet another sign that beauty M&A is picking up after a lengthy slowdown. Other recent deals include L'Oréal snapping up Medik8 and Color Wow, E.l.f. Beauty buying Hailey Bieber's Rhode and Unilever's purchase of Dr. Squatch. Other beauty brands that have been in the market for some time will no doubt be hoping that this thawing means they will soon have some success. Best of WWD Sign up for WWD's Newsletter.

mov_938934D3DC646AFCBCD354E2E246EC91,2025-07-11 06:00:00,en,WEB,"  Healthy, glowing skin straight from your bathroom Last year, we renovated our house. It cost a fortune. So holidays abroad were well and truly put on hold. As a result, I have become a dab hand at faking that gorgeous glow that you really only get after a week or two on holiday. I'm talking unrivalled radiance, sun-kissed cheeks and golden limbs that make every outfit look better. As a beauty editor, I've made it my mission over the past year to find the products that warm up the skin to make me look (and feel) healthier quickly. From tinted SPFs and bronzers, to instant tans and illuminating primers, trust me when I say I have done the legwork to find out which products apply well, look most natural and crucially, make me look radiant and tanned. Because, call me fickle, that's all I really ever want. Here I break down the different steps of my ultimate instant glow routine, which I swear by... My love of self-tan started with tanning drops. As a naturally fair 'English rose', I had always been incredibly nervous of fake tan and the inevitable mishaps that come with it. However, when I was introduced to the Isle Of Paradise Self Tanning Drops, I liked that they gave me the sense of control. It wasn't long before these little drops of sunshine became a firm fixture in my everyday skincare routine. I believe the recommendation is to use them every other day, but a few drops in my moisturiser every morning means that my skin always has a lovely, glowy canvas to apply the rest of my products. The Caudalie Self-Tan Sun Drops have become another favourite. To avoid any obvious tell-tale signs around my hairline, I use a big kabuki brush to buff my moisturiser and tanning drops in, which allows for a more natural finish. Isle of Paradise elf Tanning Face Drops in Medium Self-Tan Sun Drops Once I've applied my moisturiser, laced with tanning drops, I go in with my SPF. I've always loved a product that does more, and a base product with added sun protection is right up my street. Heliocare's 360 Colour Water Gel Bronze SPF50+ gives my skin just the right amount of coverage, evens out any irregular tone in an instant and blends in beautifully. The texture is similar to a lightweight foundation, so once I've applied it with my hands, I often buff it in with a foundation brush in areas that need thinning out slightly, like around my nose. Despite its name, it warms, rather than bronzes, the skin. And it does so beautifully. The viral Beauty of Joseon Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen is another knockout product, with 12 shades to choose from. 360 Colour Water Gel Bronze SPF50+ Beauty of Joseon Daily Tinted Fluid Sunscreen SPF30 PA+++ Every time I wear the L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion, I receive a compliment. Not only does it add a touch of colour to the skin, but it's the pearlescent sheen that it leaves behind that really makes a difference. You can use it as a primer, as I like to, tapped in as a highlighter or mixed in with your foundation for a more subtle finish. Vieve's iconic Skin Nova Instant Radiance Primer works similarly, but without the bronzing effect. Both transform tired skin in an instant. L'Oréal Paris Lumi Glotion Skin Nova Instant Radiance Primer Bronzer is arguably the must-have product in any glowing skin routine. Everybody has a preferred texture; mine will always be cream. I have dry and often dehydrated skin, so I prefer cream and liquid textures that won't settle in dry patches or fine lines. I couldn't write about tanned-looking skin without including Chanel's mega (in size and results) Les Beiges Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream. Not only does it give a natural-looking effect (which is down to its velvet matte finish), but it lasts and lasts, so is worth the investment. Earlier this year, the shade range grew, meaning it finally works for all skin tones. I can't ignore the fact that this giant bronzer does not travel well, so when I'm away from home or on the go, I use the Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Truffle. This twist-up cream bronzer has a slightly dewier finish compared to Chanel's, but the pigment payoff is great, and stick formulations make for easy application. Les Beiges Healthy Glow Bronzing Cream Westman Atelier Face Trace Contour Stick in Truffle In the middle of last summer, blonzing (a technique that blends bronzer and blusher together) became a viral make-up trend...."

While technology stocks get a lot of attention, and deservedly so, the consumer space is also full of solid companies with long growth trajectories. Here's a look at five consumer-focused stocks built for growth to buy and hold for the the long haul. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue » Amazon There is a reason why Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) The company is using AI to predict the best routes and even to make it easier for drivers to navigate complex drop-offs at places like large apartment buildings. It's also using AI to predict the best warehouses to store items in order to reduce shipping mileage and times. On top of that, it has invested heavily in robots, that with advancements in AI are now able to take on increasingly complex tasks. Its robots aren't just moving boxes and lifting heavy items, some have a sense of touch and can grab items in tough-to-reach places and others can spot damaged items, helping the company save money on costly returns. At the same time, Amazon continues to be a cloud computing leader with Amazon Web Services (AWS). It has created software tools that make it easy for developers to build and deploy AI models and tools, while the company has also developed its own proprietary chips for AI training and inference that give it a cost advantage over off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs). Put it all together, and Amazon is building one of the most powerful and defensible platforms on the planet. e.l.f. Beauty e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) Rhode brings with it higher price points and a strong skincare portfolio. That complements e.l.f.'s mass-market cosmetic lines and opens up cross-sell opportunities, as it's common in the beauty industry for consumers to use both prestige and mass products. Meanwhile, Hailey Bieber will stay on as chief creative officer, and e.l.f. will surely want to ramp up Rhode's product offerings. E.l.f. has already shown it knows how to gain share in a crowded market. It continues to expand internationally, and it should have opportunities in other adjacent markets down the road, like fragrance. With its brand-building track record and influencer marketing, e.l.f. has plenty of growth ahead. Dutch Bros One of the best themes to invest in in the consumer space is expansion, and Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) The company just rolled out mobile ordering, which should boost throughput, and it is finally looking to roll out more food options, an area where it's been notably absent. Breakfast is a massive category, and Dutch Bros has acknowledged that not offering food items during this important daypart has likely cost it sales. If its food pilot proves successful, it could be a significant driver of same-store growth. Between new food offerings and expansion, this is a stock to own for the long haul. Cava Group Another great restaurant expansion story in progress right now is Cava Group (NYSE: CAVA) The introduction of grilled steak to its menu last year was a game changer, and its menu continues to evolve and improve. Its added higher-margin items like fresh juices, and add-ons are already boosting average tickets. Cava is also experimenting with new dishes and a loyalty program to keep customers coming back. The big story, though, is still geographic expansion. With under 400 locations at the end of last quarter and a target of 1,000 by 2032, Cava's growth runway is wide open. Its ""coastal smile "" expansion strategy has worked well, and now it's starting to enter major Midwest markets like Chicago and Detroit. Cava has plenty of growth in front of it. Philip Morris International Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) Zyn has become the breakout nicotine pouch brand in the U.S., with volumes up over 50% last quarter. The company acquired the brand when it bought Swedish Match in 2022, in what has to be one of the best deals in the consumer space over the past several years. Meanwhile, Iqos continues to take share overseas, especially in Europe and Japan, and is making inroads in newer markets like Mexico City and Jakarta. The company also bought back the U.S. rights to Iqos, giving it another potential growth driver in one of the world's biggest markets. At the same time, Philip Morris still runs a profitable legacy cigarette business overseas, where pricing remains strong and volumes are more stable. Importantly, the company typically uses local manufacturing, including with Zyn, meaning it faces little tariff risk. All in all, Philip Morris is a great growth stock in a defensive industry.

Learn More Amazon There is a reason why Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has grown to become one of the world's largest companies: It isn't afraid to innovate and it invests to win. Years of heavy investment in logistics and automation continue to pay off, and  artificial intelligence (AI) is only making the company more efficient. The company has built out a regionalized fulfillment network designed to cut shipping distances and reduce costs, and now it is using AI to enhance this even more. The company is using AI to predict the best routes and even to make it easier for drivers to navigate complex drop-offs at places like large apartment buildings. It's also using AI to predict the best warehouses to store items in order to reduce shipping mileage and times.

Put it all together, and Amazon is building one of the most powerful and defensible platforms on the planet. e.l.f. Beauty e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) already rewrote the playbook on mass-market cosmetics, taking massive share over the past few years. Now, the company is going the premium route with its acquisition of Rhode, and the upside is substantial. Rhode has grown to $212 million in sales over the past year with minimal distribution and almost no paid marketing. Plug that into e.l.f.'s distribution network, which includes strong relationships with retailers like Ulta Beauty and Target, and it should be able to take the brand to new heights. Rhode brings with it higher price points and a strong skincare portfolio. That complements e.l.f.'s mass-market cosmetic lines and opens up cross-sell opportunities, as it's common in the beauty industry for consumers to use both prestige and mass products. Meanwhile, Hailey Bieber will stay on as chief creative officer, and e.l.f. will surely want to ramp up Rhode's product offerings.

Dutch Bros One of the best themes to invest in in the consumer space is expansion, and Dutch Bros (NYSE: BROS) has a big opportunity in front of it. The company now has over 1,000 locations and a clear roadmap to grow that to 7,000 over time. But this isn't just an expansion story, as Dutch Bros is also seeing strong traction with same-store sales, which climbed 4.7% last quarter. The company just rolled out mobile ordering, which should boost throughput, and it is finally looking to roll out more food options, an area where it's been notably absent. Breakfast is a massive category, and Dutch Bros has acknowledged that not offering food items during this important daypart has likely cost it sales.

The company is replicating what Chipotle Mexican Grill did a decade ago with Tex-Mex, but with Mediterranean food. Its Mediterranean-focused menu is fresh, healthy, and customizable, and consumers are responding. The company has posted four straight quarters of double-digit same-store sales growth, including a 10.8% gain last quarter, powered largely by a 7.5% jump in traffic. The introduction of grilled steak to its menu last year was a game changer, and its menu continues to evolve and improve.

Here are five monster stocks to buy right now and hold for the next five years or more. Where to invest $1,000 right now? Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocks to buy right now. Continue » 1. Amazon While Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Another behind-the-scenes area where Amazon is a market leader is robotics. The company is the world's largest operator of mobile robots, having just deployed its millionth robot, which is working at one of its fulfillment centers. These robots aren't just moving boxes, they are detecting damaged goods, navigating tight aisles, and even fixing themselves. Meanwhile, the company recently introduced its DeepFleet AI model to coordinate the movement of its entire fleet of robots in order to save time and boost throughput. The company is also using AI to create better delivery routes and make it easier for drivers to find difficult drop-off locations within large apartment or office complexes. All of this is making Amazon more efficient and should lead to strong earnings growth in the years ahead. 2. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) However, the company's bigger opportunity lies in custom AI chips. Broadcom helped Alphabet design its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and now it has multiple customers developing their own custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These chips can offer better efficiency and performance than off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs), and Broadcom has become the primary partner for several top tech companies that are creating their own custom AI ASICs. Broadcom estimates that its three customers furthest along in their development could each deploy 1 million AI chip clusters by fiscal 2027, representing a $60 billion to $90 billion total serviceable addressable market. That's a big potential growth opportunity for the company in the years ahead. 3. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) At the same time, Meta's new AI tools are improving both ad creativity and targeting, leading to better ad performance. Last quarter, ad impressions rose 5% while average price per ad jumped 10%, demonstrating that its platform is becoming more effective for marketers. In addition, Meta has two new monetization opportunities emerging. The company just started serving ads on its popular messaging platform, WhatsApp, which boasts more than 3 billion users. At the same time, it's also begun to gradually serve ads to its new social media platform Threads, which had more than 350 million monthly users as of last quarter and is growing quickly. Between the better monetization of its core platforms and new opportunities with WhatsApp and Threads, Meta has a solid growth outlook over the next several years. 4. Philip Morris International Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) Internationally, Iqos is gaining strong traction. The company sold more than 37 billion heated tobacco units last quarter, with strong growth in Japan and Europe. Philip Morris recently regained U.S. rights to Iqos and is piloting it in Austin, Texas. Once the FDA clears its latest device, a broader U.S. rollout could begin. Best of all, this would not cannibalize existing sales, since Philip Morris doesn't sell cigarettes in the U.S. What really sets these products apart, though, are their unit economics. Zyn is 6 times more profitable than traditional cigarettes, while Iqos is more than twice as profitable. In addition, Philip Morris tends to use local manufacturing, which shields it from any tariffs. With global cigarette sales still holding up outside the U.S., Philip Morris is a rare growth stock in a defensive industry. 5. E.l.f. Beauty E.l.f. Beauty (NYSE: ELF) Rhode was already set to expand into Sephora stores this year, and e.l.f. has strong relationships with retailers Ulta Beauty and Target. Increased distribution is one of the surest ways to increase growth, and e.l.f. will have a long runway of getting Rhode products onto retail shelfs. The deal also diversifies e.l.f. into prestige skincare and cosmetics, complementing its mass-market cosmetics base. That should boost margins and expand its reach to a slightly more affluent demographic. While the company will face tariff headwinds, the Rhode deal should help power strong growth in the years ahead. Should you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?..."

Where to invest $1,000 right now?Our analyst team just revealed what they believe are the 10 best stocksto buy right now. Continue Image source: Getty Images. 1. Amazon While Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is a leader in e-commerce and  cloud computing, what it is doing behind the scenes is the best reason to own the stock. At its cloud computing division, the company is helping customers customize, build, and deploy their own artificial intelligence (AI) models and tools through its Bedrock and SageMaker platforms and then run them on its infrastructure. But it goes beyond that, with Amazon having developed its own custom chips for AI training and inference, giving it a cost advantage. Another behind-the-scenes area where Amazon is a market leader is robotics. The company is the world's largest operator of mobile robots, having just deployed its millionth robot, which is working at one of its fulfillment centers. These robots aren't just moving boxes, they are detecting damaged goods, navigating tight aisles, and even fixing themselves. Meanwhile, the company recently introduced its DeepFleet AI model to coordinate the movement of its entire fleet of robots in order to save time and boost throughput. The company is also using AI to create better delivery routes and make it easier for drivers to find difficult drop-off locations within large apartment or office complexes. All of this is making Amazon more efficient and should lead to strong earnings growth in the years ahead. 2. Broadcom Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) is one of the winners of the AI infrastructure buildout. Its portfolio of networking components -- which consists of Ethernet switches, digital signal processing, network interface cards,and optical receivers -- is needed for moving data across massive AI clusters. Last quarter, the company saw a 70% jump in AI networking revenue. However, the company's bigger opportunity lies in custom AI chips. Broadcom helped Alphabet design its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs), and now it has multiple customers developing their own custom AI application-specific integrated circuits (ASICs). These chips can offer better efficiency and performance than off-the-shelf  graphics processing units (GPUs), and Broadcom has become the primary partner for several top tech companies that are creating their own custom AI ASICs. Broadcom estimates that its three customers furthest along in their development could each deploy 1 million AI chip clusters by fiscal 2027, representing a $60 billion to $90 billion total serviceable addressable market. That's a big potential growth opportunity for the company in the years ahead. 3. Meta Platforms Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) owns one of the largest digital advertising platforms in the world, and AI is making it even more powerful. The company is using its Llama AI model to drive higher engagement across Facebook and Instagram by displaying more relevant content, increasing personalization, and adding interactive features. Meanwhile, the more time users spend on its platform, the more ad inventory it has to sell. At the same time, Meta's new AI tools are improving both ad creativity and targeting, leading to better ad performance. Last quarter, ad impressions rose 5% while average price per ad jumped 10%, demonstrating that its platform is becoming more effective for marketers. In addition, Meta has two new monetization opportunities emerging. The company just started serving ads on its popular messaging platform, WhatsApp, which boasts more than 3 billion users.

Between the better monetization of its core platforms and new opportunities with WhatsApp and Threads, Meta has a solid growth outlook over the next several years. 4. Philip Morris International Philip Morris International (NYSE: PM) has become one of the best growth stories in the consumer staples space. While most tobacco companies are facing volume declines due to their U.S. exposure, Philip Morris is thriving thanks to Zyn and Iqos. Zyn nicotine pouches are exploding in popularity in the U.S., with shipments up 53% last quarter. Philip Morris raised its full-year guidance to 800 million to 840 million cans, and that still might be conservative. Internationally, Iqos is gaining strong traction. The company sold more than 37 billion heated tobacco units last quarter, with strong growth in Japan and Europe...."

NEED TO KNOW Meghan Trainor said she's on day three of dealing with a sickness that impacted her husband, Daryl Sabara, and sons Riley, 4, and Barry, 2 On her podcast, Workin' On, Trainor shared that the “tip of my tongue is burning” Her dentist said it was “burning tongue syndrome” and gave her a mouthwash that so far, hasn't helped Meghan Trainor shared she's struggling with “Burning Tongue Syndrome,” which is impacting the tip of her tongue. The “All About That Bass” singer, 31, shared on the July 10th episode of her podcast, Workin' On, that she caught a bug that went through her family — that's puzzlingly enough making her tongue burn. “I'm sick,” she said. “Yet again, but I'm not on antibiotics. I'm gonna fight it.” She then shared son Riley, 4, was the first to get sick, before the illness spread to husband Daryl Sabara, and then youngest son Barry, 2. “I have it because I just got sick, and then, I should get sick again,” she explained, her voice raspy. ” And my tongue is still burning. If anyone knows why my tip of my tongue is burning with no white patches or anything — you can barely see anything.” Meghan Trainor/Instagram Meghan Trainor with sons Barry (left) and Riley.

It's a symptom of the mysterious burning mouth syndrome, which the Mayo Clinic explains is a painful sensation inside the mouth that doesn't have an obvious cause, but symptoms are similar to the burn felt after drinking a hot beverage. Trainor, who recently launched a “Cloud Skin” makeup collab with e.l.f. Cosmetics, shared that she's been treating it with mouthwash more than four times a day, but so far, the symptoms haven't abated, much to her doctor's surprise. “She goes, 'My last patient said after two swishes, she was fine. So, you'll heal right up.' And I'm like, 'I'm on day three. So, when's the healing right up going to happen?' Little concerned, a little worried,” she said. Oral rinses and mouthwashes can help numb the symptoms, the Mayo Clinic says, along with nerve blockers and other types of medications to relieve pain. Overall, Trainor said she's “not feeling good,” adding she “hawked lugies” that morning. “I'm like, I'm having a great time in life other than this. And my body is just mad at me and I don't know why. I'm so tired. I'm trying everything,” she said, explaining, “I'm gluten-free. I'm dairy- free. I'm egg yolk-free.” The singer added, “I feel incredible and then my immune system [is] just not feeling incredible.” Read the original article on People"

The 31-year-old singer surprise-released a new album, ""Swag,"" Friday after teasing fans the previous morning with a series of billboards and social media posts. Bieber's first album since 2021's ""Justice,"" the new music prompted an online frenzy and revived a devoted community of Beliebers. From his marriage to his paparazzi encounters, Bieber has faced incredible scrutiny over the last few months, which he addresses head-on in ""Swag."" After listening to all 21 tracks, here are our biggest takeaways. Bieber has incorporated R&B elements in his music since early in his career and embraced the genre fully on the 2013 compilation album ""Journals."" But even after coining R&Bieber in 2019, he's struggled to be taken seriously. When 2020's ""Changes"" received a Grammy nomination for pop vocal album, Bieber expressed his confusion at not being nominated in the R&B category. ""To the Grammys I am flattered to be acknowledged and appreciated for my artistry. I am very meticulous and intentional about my music. With that being said I set out to make an R&B album. ' Changes' was and is an R&B album,"" he wrote on Instagram. ""It is not being acknowledged as an R&B album which is very strange to me. I grew up admiring R&B music and wished to make a project that would embody that sound."" ""To be clear I absolutely love Pop music,"" he added. ""It just wasn't what I set out to make this time around. My gratitude for feeling respected for my work remains and I am honored to be nominated either way."" On ""Swag,"" Bieber shows off his R&B chops. From opening track ""All I Can Take"" and the seemingly SZA-inspired ""Yukon"" to ""Daisies"" (which reportedly features Mk.gee on the guitar), he takes a more intimate approach than on previous albums. But still, longtime fans will hear hints of ""Journals"" and ""Changes"" throughout the project. In one of the album's unconventional moments, comedian Druski comments on Bieber's more ""soulful,"" R&B-infused sound. ""I said this album kinda sound, you got some soul on this album too, bro,"" he says on the interlude track ""Soulful."" ""Your skin white but your soul Black, Justin. I promise you, man."" Since Justin and Hailey Bieber wed in 2018, their marriage has been under a microscope. Divorce rumors circulated within months of them tying the knot, and it didn't help that many fans were still rooting for the singer to get back with ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. Bieber's love for his wife is evident throughout his catalog - from 2020's ""All Around Me"" to 2021's ""Hailey."" But in case anyone is still skeptical (they are), Bieber sets the record straight on ""Swag."" On album standout ""Walking Away,"" Bieber gets candid about his relationship troubles but also reaffirms that he's committed to his marriage. ""You were my diamond / Gave you a ring / I made you a promise / I told you I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away,"" he sings. Elsewhere on the album, he cheers on his wife. On ""Go Baby"" (which lyrically echoes 2021's ""There She Go""), he sings, ""That's my baby, she's iconic, iPhone case, lip gloss on it"" - a reference to the Rhode founder's famous lip gloss-holder phone case. Recently, Hailey sold her skin-care company, which she launched in 2022, to e.l.f Beauty for $1 billion. There she goes indeed. The Biebers' pregnancy announcement in May 2024 was accompanied by an unknown instrumental track. Now, fans have identified it as ""Devotion"" featuring Dijon. On the heartwarming track, Bieber sings, ""When your lips and fingernails are all mine / I promise to take my time givin' you devotion."" The singer also celebrates being a father to Jack Blues Bieber, born Aug. 23, 2024, on ""Dadz Love."" As rapper Lil B declares we need ""less hatin'"" and ""more love,"" Bieber repeats the track title (which sounds like ""that's love"") over and over. Soon after the singer announced the surprise album, fans flocked to social media to express their excitement. ""New album - bieber fever hitting like it's 2010,"" TikTok user @jennyboba posted to the will.i.am collab ""#thatPOWER."" ""Justin Bieber is back… I used to pray for times like this,"" singer d4vd posted on X. Others reactivated their old X fan accounts and created group chats to celebrate the release. ""We're creating a SWAG group chat to keep up with all the updates! Like or reply so I can add you,"" @statsonbieber announced in a post that's since received almost 6,000 likes and more than 600 comments. Bieber fever may have been latent for years, but it's making the rounds once again. Bieber's had his fair share of viral paparazzi moments over the past year. Most notable was his encounter with photographers while leaving Malibu's SoHo House, when he declared, ""It's not clocking to you that I'm standing on business."" The singer's misuse of African American Vernacular English has turned into an internet meme, but Bieber's in on the joke...."

From his marriage to his paparazzi encounters, Bieber has faced incredible scrutiny over the last few months, which he addresses head-on in “Swag.” After listening to all 21 tracks, here are our biggest takeaways. R&Bieber is back Table of Contents Bieber has incorporated R&B elements in his music since early in his career and embraced the genre fully on the 2013 compilation album “Journals.” But even after coining R&Bieber in 2019, he's struggled to be taken seriously. When 2020's “Changes” received a Grammy nomination for pop vocal album, Bieber expressed his confusion at not being nominated in the R&B category. “To the Grammys I am flattered to be acknowledged and appreciated for my artistry. I am very meticulous and intentional about my music. With that being said I set out to make an R&B album. ' Changes' was and is an R&B album,” he wrote on Instagram. “It is not being acknowledged as an R&B album which is very strange to me. I grew up admiring R&B music and wished to make a project that would embody that sound.” “To be clear I absolutely love Pop music,” he added. “It just wasn't what I set out to make this time around. My gratitude for feeling respected for my work remains and I am honored to be nominated either way.” On “Swag,” Bieber shows off his R&B chops. From opening track “All I Can Take” and the seemingly SZA-inspired “Yukon” to “Daisies” (which reportedly features Mk.gee on the guitar), he takes a more intimate approach than on previous albums. But still, longtime fans will hear hints of “Journals” and “Changes” throughout the project. In one of the album's unconventional moments, comedian Druski comments on Bieber's more “soulful,” R&B-infused sound. “I said this album kinda sound, you got some soul on this album too, bro,” he says on the interlude track “Soulful.” “Your skin white but your soul Black, Justin. I promise you, man.” He's not 'Walking Away' from his marriage Since Justin and Hailey Bieber wed in 2018, their marriage has been under a microscope. Divorce rumors circulated within months of them tying the knot, and it didn't help that many fans were still rooting for the singer to get back with ex-girlfriend Selena Gomez. Bieber's love for his wife is evident throughout his catalog — from 2020's “All Around Me” to 2021's “Hailey.” But in case anyone is still skeptical (they are), Bieber sets the record straight on “Swag.” On album standout “Walking Away,” Bieber gets candid about his relationship troubles but also reaffirms that he's committed to his marriage. “You were my diamond / Gave you a ring / I made you a promise / I told you I'd change / It's just human nature / These growing pains / And baby, I ain't walking away,” he sings. Elsewhere on the album, he cheers on his wife. On “Go Baby” (which lyrically echoes 2021's “There She Go”), he sings, “That's my baby, she's iconic, iPhone case, lip gloss on it” — a reference to the Rhode founder's famous lip gloss-holder phone case. Recently, Hailey sold her skin-care company, which she launched in 2022, to e.l.f Beauty for $1 billion. There she goes indeed.

Now, fans have identified it as “Devotion” featuring Dijon. On the heartwarming track, Bieber sings, “When your lips and fingernails are all mine / I promise to take my time givin' you devotion.” The singer also celebrates being a father to Jack Blues Bieber, born Aug. 23, 2024, on “Dadz Love.” As rapper Lil B declares we need “less hatin'” and “more love,” Bieber repeats the track title (which sounds like “that's love”) over and over. There's no cure for Bieber fever Soon after the singer announced the surprise album, fans flocked to social media to express their excitement. “New album – bieber fever hitting like it's 2010,” TikTok user @jennyboba posted to the will.i.am collab “#thatPOWER.” “Justin Bieber is back… I used to pray for times like this,” singer d4vd posted on X...."

mov_CBF88DB5433CA59566B26443100647CD,2025-07-12 08:32:59,en,WEB,"  Justin Bieber has reportedly settled with Scooter Braun, his former manager, for $31.5 million over their financial dispute regarding the pop star's canceled ""Justice Tour"" and alleged unpaid commissions. This news came amid the release of the pop singer's seventh studio album, , on July 11, 2025. On July 10, 2025, TMZ reported that Bieber and Braun reached a $31.5 million settlement regarding their financial dispute. News of Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun reportedly settling their financial dispute was met with mixed reactions from netizens on X, with one user accusing the former manager of robbing Bieber. ""So scooter robbed justin, disgusting, karma is coming."" liv @grandesnasaso scooter robbed justin, disgusting, karma is coming Several netizens agreed with this sentiment, claiming Braun was a ""fake friend"" to Bieber. ""That person should change their name to scooter robber,"" one person tweeted. ""All my homies hate scooter braun,"" another person added. ""That's when you know there are no friends in the music business…Braun always acted like he was Justin's friend and cared for him…but once it affected his pockets all that fake friendship went out the window… and we all saw the medical issues that made Justin cancel the tour,"" someone else commented. ""Scooter deserves no more money after this,"" another user said. Others speculated whether the pop star's wife, Hailey Bieber, was instrumental in settling the debt. For context, Hailey sold her beauty brand, Rhode, to e.l.f Beauty for $1 billion in late May 2025. ""Hailey helped him pay the debt by selling her company,"" one person speculated. ""I bet that was Hailey's Rhode money,"" another person added. ""That rhode money is gonna last nothing at this point,"" someone else commented. ""Hence the lovely posts with wifey! Women always save the day smh,"" another user wrote. Exploring Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun's financial dispute The financial dispute between Justin Bieber and Scooter Braun began in 2022, while the singer was on his ""Justice Tour"" to promote his sixth studio album. For the uninitiated, Bieber reportedly received a $40 million advance from Anschutz Entertainment Group (AEG), which is Live Nation's parent company, for his ""Justice Tour"" in 2022. However, the singer canceled most of the tour in 2023 due to a health condition (he was diagnosed with Ramsay Hunt syndrome) and was asked to pay back $26 million of the advance to AEG. According to TMZ, Scooter Braun, who was Bieber's manager at the time, shouldered the payment through his company Hybe, with the pop star promising to pay Hybe and Braun back in installments over the next 10 years. Justin Bieber reportedly paid just one installment and stopped. However, recent reports indicate that Bieber and Braun have settled the payment, which also included an additional clause requiring Bieber to pay half of the $11 million that he allegedly owed Braun in unpaid commissions, bringing the total to $31.5 million. As per the TMZ report, this does not include the additional $8.6 million that Bieber allegedly owed Braun in further unpaid commissions, which the former manager waived. There have been multiple reports of Justin Bieber's alleged financial struggles, which many believe contributed to the singer selling his 291-song catalogue to Hipgnosis Songs Capital in December 2022 for $200 million. A TMZ documentary released in May 2025, titled alleged that the singer “had to sell his music catalog because he was broke.” “I was on a call with multiple people — Justin's side acknowledges that in 2022, he was on the verge of… the words were 'financial collapse.' And that's why he had to sell his catalog,” TMZ executive producer Levin says in the documentary. However, Justin Bieber has denied all rumors of his alleged financial troubles, with his representative telling The Hollywood Reporter in April 2025: “Any source that is trying to sell you a story about alleged financial distress … either doesn't understand the entertainment industry or, more likely, is trying to paint an unflattering portrait of Justin, which bears no resemblance to reality.” As per Celebrity Net Worth, Justin Bieber's net worth is reportedly $200 million as of July 2025. In other news, Justin Bieber surprised fans after he released his new album, , on July 11 with minimal promotion. The 21-track album reportedly features artists like Cash Cobain, Gunna, and Druski.

It was actually pretty decent and if he wasn't who he is, I'd possibly splurge on something like it when I felt like doing more than drug store, Target store stuff. But for as little as I wear make up and the person he is, I'd never spend money on it. Honestly it feels like almost all the big makeup ""stars"" (no pun intended) from that era ended up being awful and makes me glad I was never embarrassed to just but e.l.f, Maybelline and stuff like that.

Instead of relying on centralized distribution and profit-driven retail platforms like Amazon and Whole Foods Market, the campaign leverages blockchain infrastructure to bypass gatekeepers and return control to the people—farmers, co-ops, and independent buyers—through smart contracts and peer-to-peer exchanges built on Ethereum and Bitcoin. It's not just rebellion—it's recalibration. Tarian's movement at plantbased.cloud  is revolutionizing the food and wellness industry by dismantling the dominance of centralized giants like Amazon and Whole Foods—now with even broader reach. Using Ethereum smart contracts and Bitcoin's decentralized architecture, the platform transcends borders and empowers individuals to reclaim control over supply chains, commerce, and consumption. But this isn't just about distribution—it's about creation, connection, and choice. More than a campaign, plantbased.cloud  is a full-scale ecosystem for plant-based living. It proudly hosts brands like E.L.F. BEAUTY allowing cruelty-free, botanical-forward products to thrive without retail gatekeeping. At the same time, its global network of cloud kitchens serves up vibrant, plant-based, vegetarian, and vegan dishes designed for joy and nourishment—not just sustenance. From skincare to soul food, this platform embodies ethical consumption in every bite and bottle. As it expands worldwide, Tarian's decentralized blueprint is replacing extractive models with regenerative ones. The infrastructure isn't anchored to warehouse monopolies—it's coded into blockchain, activated by community participation, and fueled by values that honor the planet and its people. It's not just an alternative to Amazon and Whole Foods—it's the successor. Stand under Tarian's umbrella because the future is plantbased.cloud."

A screen-cleaning brush for anyone who struggles to see out of their windows because of grime-covered mesh screens. Is that a twig or a crack in the glass? Maybe there's a dead bug clinging to the outside of the screen, and he's been there for so long that you've named him. (Everyone say hello to Carl!) Promising review: ""Our screens are on a second-floor balcony. There really isn't any good way to clean the outside of the screens. Luckily, the fibers on this screen cleaner are small enough that they seem to fit through the screen and clean both sides. I'm sure it doesn't clean the outside as well as it does the inside, but any help is always appreciated. I was actually shocked at how much dirt came off of the screens with this very simple tool. I used it wet with a small amount of dish soap, and it worked really well. I also appreciated that after I was finished I was just easily able to rinse and dry the screen cleaner for future use. A simple tool at an excellent price."" —BonjourBeautyByAmy Get it from Amazon for $17.09. 2. A slicker brush if your fave fleece blanket or rug started out so cozy and plush, but now the once-fluffy fabric is clumpy, matted, and not so soft. This genius brush is designed to restore cashmere, faux fur, sheepskin, wool, and more so it feels (and looks!) new again. Promising review: ""Where have these been all my life? We purchased a couple of beautiful charcoal-gray (dyed) sheepskin rugs for both sides of our bed. It used to feel really nice to get out of bed and set your feet on them. But after many years and a couple of dogs, my reaction to putting my feet down is, 'Ew. What the heck did I just step on?' Because of the dye, we can't just wash them or get them too wet. And I'm kind of lazy and forgetful. (Meaning, I've been thinking of taking them to a dry cleaner for years — but how much will that cost?) After our puppy had an accident (the worst kind of accident) on one, I knew I had to do something. These rugs weren't cheap, so tossing them wasn't an option. I cleaned up the 'accident' as best I could, but that left the spot feeling kind of dry and crunchy. So, after reading and googling, I decided to try one of these wire wool brushes. HALLELUJAH! It took some muscle to thoroughly brush each rug, but wow, not only did it re-fluff and revive the wool, but it also pulled up a lot of loose dirt and anything that was stuck to the fibers. I really wish I had gotten this brush sooner!"" —Renee Get it from Amazon for $17.99. 3. A collagen-coating hair treatment so you can give your dry, damaged, and overprocessed strands the TLC they need. This reparative five-minute hair mask will revive your mane and leave it soft, silky, and smooth. Promising review: ""My hair used to be really soft, and then I discovered hot tools and hair dye. While my hair looks good, I really missed the soft texture. This works so well. There are no instructions on the box, but I washed my hair with my usual shampoo, towel dried it, worked about two quarter-sized dollops through my hair, let it sit for 20 minutes, and then rinsed out. I went to bed with wet hair, which usually results in my hair being kind of tangled and rough-looking, but I woke up and my hair was as soft and silky as it was before I started coloring it. I'm totally in love with this product. I have long, fine hair, but this doesn't leave it greasy or weigh it down. I'll definitely buy again."" —Ellie Get it from Amazon for $7.50...."

In all my years of existence, I was never able to tame my naturally curly hair into a sleek, silky, frizz-free look, until now. I l don't know what kind of magical sorcery went into making this product, but this stuff is amazing. —Lillee45 Get it from Amazon for $12+ (available in two sizes). 2. Or a deep-conditioning hair mask promising smoother, shinier, and stronger hair, even if you're fighting against bleached, dry, or damaged locks. It can even handle Florida levels of humidity! Soak your hair in this elixir for 30ish minutes up to three times a week. It works for all hair types. Promising review: ""I just can't believe the difference in my hair!!! I'm in my '60s, and my hair was dry and dull because of my medications. I just hated my hair. I bought this not expecting too much, but was I wrong!!!! I left it on for 30 minutes because I wanted the best result possible. Wow!! My hair feels wonderful, it's fuller and thicker looking, body galore, and I just can't quit looking at my hair. I will NEVER quit using this!!!"" —lucymae Get it from Amazon for $27.99. 3. A pair of charcoal shoe deodorizers to help you reclaim your sneakers from the dreaded Stink. Just slip them into your shoes and let them get to work. To ""recharge,"" leave them in the sun. Promising review: ""I have a pair of black leather flats that stank so badly my husband would yell at me if I took them off anywhere near him. But I love the shoes! So I had to find something to make the stench go away without leaving me with an allergic reaction. Mini Moso was the answer. I honestly couldn't believe it. A few days after placing them in my prized off shoes, I took a whiff from about a foot away. Nothing. I got closer. Nothing. I stuck my nose practically in the shoe. OK, maybe that's pushing things, but I've got to tell you that 95% of the broken-in leather grossness was gone. So happy!"" —Erin Get a pair from Amazon for $9.95. 4. Hawaiian Tropic's SPF 30 Mineral Powder Sunscreen Brush offering some light coverage (and extra sun protection on top of your normal sunscreen) that won't weigh you down on hot days. Most intriguing: Reviewers are using this on their scalp and hairline because YES scalp burns can happen and NO we're not putting goopy sunscreen in our hair. It's also wayyy cheaper than the $69 Colorescience version. Promising review: ""Wish I would have found this sooner! Works great and so far the cheapest option I have found for powder sunscreen. Love that my face isn't greasy anymore from normal sunscreen!"" —Michelle..."

A couple of days ago, I tried laminating my eyebrows at home with a kit from Amazon. They aren't waxed or trimmed yet, so they're still a work in progress. I'm also currently figuring out my skincare routine. I'd love some makeup recommendations for natural, everyday looks. Something quick and easy that doesn't require a lot of products or time. Any suggestions for simple routines would be appreciated."
