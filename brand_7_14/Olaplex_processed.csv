Who's washing their hair today? In my last reel I shared my wash n go routine  using a new gel and here are my final results! After doing a wash n go, I always wait until my curls are fully dry before stretching them. This helps me maintain definition at the roots while adding that extra volume and shape I love‚Äîwithout causing unnecessary frizz or disrupting my curl pattern. Stretching also helps me get more wear out of my style throughout the week. It keeps my hair from shrinking too much and helps with minimizing tangles. I shared my complete Wash N Go routine on YouTube channel, including the products and techniques I use to get this definition.

18147160147389495,2025-06-16 03:31:20,en,INSTAGRAM,"‚Äâ 6 things I've changed in my haircare routine these last few months: 1. Only washing my hair every other day. I used to wash my hair every day, which was fine for my oily scalp and hair, but sadly, I noticed it made my hair color strips faster I now wash it every other day, and I use dry shampoo only on my fringe in the meantime. I also experiment with updos 2. Re-introducing drugstore haircare in my hair routine, with sulfates and silicones in their formulas. (My wallet is very happy üòÅ) Sulfates are indeed great cleansing ingredients, and not as harsh as you'd think. And silicones are amazing to help to detangle and protect the hair. We totally want their coating abilities for frizz reduction, enhanced shine, and improved hair manageability, especially if it's long! 3. Using bond repair products more frequently in my hair care routine. Bond repair products really help to improve hair strength, reduce breakage, increase shine, enhance manageability, and improved overall hair health. And now, you can find bond repair products at almost every price range! I still love my k18hair and olaplex, but I also use some bond repair ranges from the drugstore (dove, lorealparis, ogx_beauty...). 4. Systematically adding a protective leave-in product before drying and styling my hair. Leave in products provide extra moisture, help to detangle the hair, and to protect hair from heat styling and environmental damage. It's a great way to reduce frizz, and improve hair manageability. Loving the lorealparis 21 in 1 at the moment, but I also want to try the one from pantene next 5. Doing a hair protecting hair style at night. Something like loose braids, pineapple bun, or a twisted top bun. These styles help to minimize friction and breakage while I sleep. I also begun to use a silk bonnet to further reduce friction and maintain moisture. It's only been a week but I can already feel that my hair is softer in the morning I bought mine on Amazon.

Wenn du langes, gesundes Haar willst, f√ºhrt da kein Weg dran vorbei. ‚úÇÔ∏è üëâüèº Hitzestyling? Nur, wenn's sein muss. Hitze entzieht Feuchtigkeit und zwar ziemlich stark. Je √∂fter du stylst, desto trockener wird es. üî• üëâüèº Feuchtigkeitsmaske = Pflichtprogramm. Pflege muss rein, wenn st√§ndig was rausgeht. Mit einer hochwertigen Maske bleibt dein Blond geschmeidig & gl√§nzend, nicht nur an Tag 1. ‚ú® üëâüèº F√∂hnen, ja, aber richtig! Vom Ansatz bis in die Spitzen, immer in Richtung der Schuppenschicht. So bleibt sie sch√∂n geschlossen und sch√ºtzt dein Haar.

The tool is the 'Bed Head Waver' and you can get it on Amazon for like 20 bucks! Yes it can steam sometimes but it's just bc of the product I put on my hair it's not burning my hair Here are a couple steps to make sure your hair stays healthy and looks good after: 1. Always use a heat protectant- my favorite is the Olaplex #6 2. I use it on medium heat or lower 3. After I finish I like to coat my hair in a serum- my fave is the Amika serum. 4. Start about 4 fingers from the scalp 5. If it feels too big I promise the next day it's my favorite- so sometimes I like to do it at night and then sleep in it.

It's an annual mega-sale event exclusively for Amazon Prime members, where for 48 hours ‚Äî this year, four full days, but more on that later ‚Äî the retailer's site turns into a digital carnival of deals. Think of it as Black Friday's hyper cousin who shows up with fireworks, coupon codes and a credit card ready to party. From tech gadgets and beauty steals to quirky home stuff you didn't know you needed, everything is up for grabs at jaw-droppingly low prices. But, don't blink! Lightning Deals (yes, that's a real thing) vanish in minutes, and savvy shoppers set alarms, prep wishlists and limber up their fingers for some serious clicking action. And hey, it's not just about shopping; Amazon uses Prime Day to spotlight its own gadgets like Alexa devices, Fire tablets and Kindle e-readers, usually at their lowest prices of the year. Bottom line: if you've got a Prime membership and a love for snagging deals, Prime Day is your playground. What's new for Prime Day 2025 This year, Prime Day is four days long, spanning from July 8 to July 11, as announced by Amazon. This allows for more shopping, more deals and more time to get your Amazon cart in order. Not to worry, though. Post Wanted is working around the clock to litter your shopping feed with the best of the best. After all, we do this for a living. Our trend predictions amid tariffs and what will be the most popular thing to shop for There is plenty of talk about tariffs, and we predict that they will be shaking up Amazon Prime Day for 2025. With U.S.-China trade tensions still casting a shadow, many third-party sellers are pulling back from participating in Prime Day. Why? Because hefty import tariffs and rising fulfillment costs are squeezing their margins, making it harder to offer the deep discounts shoppers have come to expect. This may mean fewer flash deals on popular tech gadgets, home goods and accessories, and a greater emphasis on Amazon's own brands like Echo, Ring, and Fire devices. So, while Prime Day will still be packed with deals, the variety might be a bit more limited, and some prices could be higher than in previous years. This may explain Amazon's call for a four-day shopping event: to allow users more time to make the best of their purchasing decisions. As for shopping trends this summer, Amazon is buzzing with fashion finds that are both stylish and budget-friendly. From breezy dresses and trendy sandals to chic accessories like straw bags and stylish sunglasses, we anticipate that fashion will be largely popular and on sale. It will also be a great time to purchase big-ticket items on Amazon, like outdoor patio furniture and sleeper sofas for your guest room makeover. When is Amazon Prime Day 2025? Amazon confirmed its return for July, and the retailer officially announced that Prime Day will return on July 8 at 12:01 a.m. PT and last until July 11. This is the first year that Prime Day will go from its usual two-day time period to a four-day deals soiree. That's 96 straight hours of deals! Do I need to be a Prime member to shop Prime Day? Yes, you do need to be an Amazon Prime member to access the full range of Prime Day deals. While a few select discounts might be visible to non-members, the real treasure chest of flash sales, deep discounts and exclusive offers is locked behind the Prime membership. The good news? If you're not already a member, you can usually sign up for a free 30-day trial just before Prime Day and still score all the perks. Just remember to cancel if you don't want to keep it afterward. What stores offer competing Prime Day sales? Oh, you better believe Amazon's not the only one throwing a shopping party during Prime Day...."

mov_11CBEE04293044E11B84629F1FA22D5E,2025-06-17 15:46:05,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Amazon Prime Day is back from 8 to 11 July, bringing four days of offers on everything from mattresses and air fryers to electric toothbrushes, laptops and Apple tech. Exclusive to Amazon Prime subscribers, prices will be slashed across third-party brands like Shark, CeraVe, Elemis and Dyson. There will also be offers on Amazon's own devices ‚Äì think Kindles, Echo Dot smart speakers and Fire tablets. In previous years, we've seen plenty of big-ticket products fall to their lowest ever price during the sale, such as the AirPods Pro 2 earbuds, which were reduced to just ¬£179 last year. While the sale hasn't kicked off yet, there are still countless deals at Amazon right now. Keep scrolling for all the latest details on the next Prime Day sale and our team's hand-picked selection of the very best Amazon deals available today. When is Amazon Prime Day 2025? Amazon has confirmed that the next Prime Day sale will take place from Tuesday 8 to Friday 11 July. This is the first time the sales event has run for four days, so you'll have even more time to shop the best deals. What is Amazon Prime Day? Amazon Prime Day is a four-day sale event for Prime members. It's usually held twice a year ‚Äì once in the summer and again in October to kick-start Christmas shopping. The event features deals across top brands, from Apple to Dyson, as well as offers on its bestselling own tech, including Kindle and Echo dot smart speakers. Do you need to be a Prime member? If you want to take advantage of Prime Day discounts, you must be a Prime member. A Prime membership costs ¬£8.99 a month, or ¬£95 if you pay annually. If you're between 18 to 22-years-old, this is half the standard price and you get a 6-month trial to see if it's for you. Perks include unlimited one-day delivery, access to Prime Video and the chance to shop Prime-exclusive deals. However, if you're unsure about adding another monthly cost to your bills, you can sign up for a free 30-day trial. This will give you full access to all the Prime member benefits, and you can cancel at any time during your trial to avoid being charged when it expires. Just bear in mind that this only works if you haven't signed for the free trial before. How to get the best deal on Amazon Prime Day Before you shop the Amazon Prime Day sale, make a wish list to avoid buying products that you don't really need. Once the sale starts, use price history tools, such as CamelCamelCamel, to see if you're truly getting a good deal or if you should hold off buying until the price goes down even further. It's also worth doing a quick Google search to see if you can get a better price at other retailers. Competing retailers often reduce the prices of popular products to match, or even provide a better offer, than Amazon. They may also throw in a longer warranty or free delivery.

There's built-in access to all the main streaming services, including Netflix, Disney+ and Prime Video. Right now, you can pick up the set with a 28 per cent discount, so this inexpensive TV is now even cheaper.

1lehvpq,2025-06-18 14:01:27,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Hi, I have about chin length, medium thickness, lower density 3A-3B hair. My hair was fine until recently and then after this one wash, no matter how many times I clarify, what products I use, how I dry, extra steps I take (like plopping, clipping while diffusing, etc), etc, I just can't get my hair to not ‚Äúdie‚Äù within a day or so. I feel like every waking moment I have to check and make sure my hair isn't clinging to my skull, because it inevitably does and it's so frustrating. I've been sleeping on a satin pillowcase for ages and I've been using these products for about 7 months now. The main shampoo, conditioner, and leave in are the L'or√©al Elvive Dream Lengths Curls line. I used to use I Create Hold, I Create Lift, and I Create Volume by Innersense but now I'm too scared to. I tried to Olaplex detox shampoo and used my normal conditioners and the rest of my routine and the same problem happened. I tried the Olaplex detox shampoo and then tried an Innersense shampoo and the same problem happened. I tried the Olaxplex shampoo and then tried the Innersense shampoo and didn't follow up with any styling products but gel and it still happened. I tried my normal routine again but in less amounts, the same issue happened again. No matter all of this, the issue persists. Lately, before going to bed, I just wet my hair, scrunch, and go to bed with my hair wet because it's the only way I've been able to get somewhat okay hair, even if it last like 24 hours, because diffusing has just become so weird. I don't know what's happening, I don't even know what other info to give. This is so frustrating. I can't tell if my hair is just too heavy now, if I have moisture or protein overload or something, if even after this much clarification i need to do more, if this is a sign or a hair or health condition or just what is going on."

So here's the truth: Getting this color is a process. If your natural hair is darker, you won't get here in one session and you shouldn't try. Rushing can seriously damage your hair. ‚ú® My biggest advice: Find a professional hairdresser you really trust. Bleaching can be harsh, and the right hands make all the difference. We did this step-by-step over time, and my hair stayed strong throughout. I swear by olaplex this saved my hair, plus natural, vegan hair care like masks, leave-ins, and conditioners. Twice a week, I do an avocado mask to keep it soft and hydrated. And don't forget: trim your ends every few months it helps more than you think. Everyone's hair is different. Some can handle more, others are more fragile. Always ask a pro if this color is even possible with your hair type and never try to bleach to white blonde on your own. Take it slow, do it right, and your hair will thank you ü§ç#haircare #whiteblonde #platinumblonde #healthyhair #veganhairproducts #olaplex #hairgoals #hairproducts #ugc #ugccontentcreator #ugccreator #contentcreator #hairmodel"

A jar of¬†E.l.f. poreless primer putty¬†so you can kiss your pores buh-bye! This primer will help you get a super smooth canvas to put your foundation on and will have you looking like your makeup was professionally airbrushed while helping to keep your beat in place. Say sayonara to your oily makeup looks and say heyyyy to a matte look. Promising reviews: ""Highly recommend. I learned about it because several influencers use it on¬†TikTok. Tried it and it's my favorite, better than all the expensive brands I've tried before. Smooth application and does an excellent job! Excellent."" ‚ÄîBinnyx1 ""WOW!!!! I've been looking for a pore-filling primer for some time now ‚Äî I am very, very picky and usually try to use super lightweight primers because my skin is sensitive, so I was a tad bit skeptical of this because it looks so thick in the package photos. However, I'm a BELIEVER now, y'all. It's much less thick than it looks and spreads super easy and evenly. My pores are getting smaller thanks to a new skincare routine, but I've been SO frustrated trying to find a primer that will actually conceal my pores so they don't completely suck up the foundation and make me look awful. This. Is. IT! I wear the primer with Missha BB cream cushion foundation, usually I don't go for super heavy coverage because of said pores but I was able to build to a fuller coverage than what I normally would, and my skin looks smooth and moisturized. Of course if you get super up close pores are still visible but MUCH less so than they are with other primers. You can't beat this for the price. I've even tried the Maybelline Baby Skin pore filler primer and this blows it out of the water. Can't beat it, especially for the price!!!!"" ‚ÄîJody Ferguson Get it from Amazon for¬†$10. 2.

Promising reviews: ""My hair had so much breakage from coloring it so much over the years and I was on the verge of completely shaving it. I saw one of God's favorites on TikTok with the hair of a goddess suggest this stuff. All I can say is wow! This cream must have been dropped from Heaven because it has saved my fried hair. Worth every penny, with this stuff, you too can be one of God's favorites."" ‚ÄîKirstin ""I have used this product three times so far and have noticed a significant difference in my hair. I had my hair colored and experienced dryness and breakage. This product was recommended by a YouTuber so I gave it a try and am pleased.

Promising reviews: ""This stuff is so legit I've gone through three bottles. Adds the perfect glow to your skin!

Growing concerns about hair fall, thinning, and scalp health are boosting the demand for specialized hair serums. Shoppers are gravitating toward clean, natural, and multifunctional products, which drive growth in this segment. Influencer promotions and social media conversations play a key role in raising product awareness and strengthening brand connections within the hair care market. In the U.S., androgenetic alopecia, commonly known as male or female pattern baldness, affects up to 70% of men and 40% of women. The emotional impact of hair thinning, including decreased confidence and self-esteem, has led many to seek effective treatment options. While clinical solutions like minoxidil and finasteride are available, their potential side effects and the necessity for prescriptions have prompted an increasing number of consumers to pursue non-invasive, user-friendly alternatives. Consequently, topical hair serums have become popular for their ease of use, natural or clinically supported ingredients, and suitability for daily application. U.S. consumers are increasingly favoring hair care products made with plant-based, organic, and environmentally friendly ingredients such as argan oil, green tea, and rosemary. They also expect brands to embody these values through sustainable and clean packaging. Supporting this trend, a CleanHub survey revealed that 81% of beauty shoppers want brands to reduce plastic use, 47% prefer recyclable packaging, and 40% favor refillable options. Request a free sample copy or view report summary:¬†U.S. Hair Serum Market Report U.S. Hair Serum Market Report Highlights Consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the damage caused by frequent use of heat-styling tools like blow dryers, flat irons, and curling wands, which can lead to dryness, frizz, and breakage. In response, many styling serums now incorporate heat-protectant properties to shield hair during styling. A popular example in the U.S. is the TRESemm√© Keratin Smooth Heat Protect Spray, which guards against temperatures up to 450¬∞F. Enriched with keratin and marula oil, it helps reduce frizz, enhance shine, and prevent heat-related damage, making it a reliable choice for everyday styling. ‚Ä¢ Synthetic hair serums enjoy popularity among U.S. consumers due to their cost-effectiveness, dependable performance, and user-friendly nature. Typically crafted with silicones like dimethicone, these serums provide immediate benefits such as increased shine, frizz control, and a smooth texture that suits the fast-paced American lifestyle. For instance, Garnier Fructis Sleek & Shine Anti-Frizz Serum combines dimethicone with nourishing argan oil to deliver long-lasting smoothness, shine, and effective frizz protection, even in humid weather. . ‚Ä¢ Many U.S. consumers prefer to buy hair serums from pharmacies and drugstores because of their trusted product quality, expert pharmacist advice, convenient locations, and competitive prices. A Harris Poll found that 91% of consumers favor shopping for hair products in-store, appreciating the ability to see, touch, and sample items before purchasing, an experience more readily available at physical retail outlets.

The important thing is is to have your hair lifted as much as possible and then get some neutral toner, a clear and then I use a shades EQ that my hairdresser gets for me -it's yellow. I don't remember the name, but I use the tiniest tiniest dot of yellow into my toner bowl with 10 volume and it will give me that butter yellow, not as pretty as I want it because it's more like a flat yellow color. I've also used one of the yellow vivids"",  if you will using it the same way. I got it Sally's, but it too can also look a little flat but I do get that butter yellow blonde that I love. Yellow blonde is much different than gold and I don't look good in gold blonde, but those warmer blonde  looks way better on you.

Veet's sensitive hair removal gel¬†that's formulated with aloe, so it's perfect for anyone who typically deals with redness and irritation after hair removal. It's also meant to provide longer-lasting results when compared to traditional shaving and reduce the chance of ingrowns. Be prepared to pat yourself on your smooth, hairless back! It comes with a spatula for removing the cream! Just be sure to test a small area of your skin and make sure there are no adverse reactions for 24 hours. Promising review:¬†""I have been looking for a good hair removal for my sensitive skin and this one is perfect. It has a great odor and leaves my skin feeling smooth and silky. It does not burn my skin at all, even when I leave it on for 15 minutes or more. This is definitely my new hair removal cream. I will recommend this one to everyone."" ‚ÄîCrystal Get it from Amazon for $9.99¬†(also available in a two-pack). 2. A pack of carborundum sponges¬†‚Äî these things are tough, so prepare to send all your other kitchen sponges across the street to Weenie Hut Jr's. The super scrubby material makes it easy to get rid of those stubborn stains on the bottom of all your most-used pots and pans, so give these a shot before splurging for a new set. The high-density sponges are squishy on the inside with an emery layer on the outside. They can be cut into smaller chunks for cleaning nooks and crannies. Promising review: ""Nice and thin. You'll find so many more uses for these around the house than just getting stuff off the underside of cookware! I had hard, scaly water deposits on the glass surrounding our powder room faucet (one of those fancy, highfalutin modern-looking things). I've tried everything for four years to get this stuff off. One day I thought, maybe I'll try my sponges. Took it all off super easily!!!! The faucet looks new. My only rec is to spot-test your item first before using it because it will scratch¬†certain surfaces if you scrub too aggressively (for example, it gets the burned-on, weird stuff off of the bottom of my fave Our Place pan, but I rubbed too hard in one spot and it took the color right off lol)."" ‚ÄîHoarder Get an eight-pack from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in two sponge thicknesses). 3. A¬†deep-conditioning hair mask¬†that not only leaves your hair feeling buttery smooth but also helps repair bonds that may be broken due to coloring or styling treatments. Think Olaplex, but in a conditioning, frizz-fighting formula that includes Brazil nut seed and argan oils for extra moisture. Let it sit for 30 minutes or up to two hours if your hair is feeling especially damaged. Promising review: ""I just can't believe the difference in my hair!!! I'm in my 60s, and my hair was dry and dull because of my medications. I just hated my hair. I bought this not expecting too much, but was I wrong!!!! I left it on for 30 minutes because I wanted the best¬†result¬†possible. Wow!! My hair feels wonderful, it's fuller and thicker looking, body galore, and I just can't quit looking at my hair. I will NEVER quit using this!!!"" ‚Äîlucymae Get it from Amazon for $27.99. 4. Some beloved¬†Hard as Hoof nourishing cream¬†made with beeswax and jojoba oil to condition brittle nails and cuticles (on your fingers AND toes!) and have them looking as shiny and fresh as they did before that gel manicure did its damage. It's designed to sink in quickly (a rare feat in the world of cuticle oils), and it also smells like coconuts. I probably should have led with the coconut part.

Luxury goods. President Donald Trump's tariffs have spurred some Amazon sellers who source products from China and other heavily tariffed countries to bow out of the company's Prime Day, one of its biggest sales events of the year, to protect their margins. Amazon Prime Day is now a four-day shopping event exclusively for Amazon Prime members, taking place this year from July 8 to July 11. The Seattle-based e-commerce company is hoping that recent sales growth in high-margin cosmetics in its Amazon Premium Beauty category will cushion the impact of tariffs on Prime Day sales revenue and consumer sentiment. ""Beauty has become, in the past few years, more of an essential item in consumers' minds,"" even in hard financial times, said Anna Mayo, vice president of NielsenIQ's Beauty Vertical unit. Amazon Premium Beauty was initially shunned by luxury cosmetic players who feared the platform would harm their image when it was launched in 2013. But those days are gone. Now, the online retailer is promoting products from top beauty and haircare brands including Estee Lauder's EL Clinique, Olaplex OLPX and L'Oreal's Urban Decay. During last year's Prime Day event, U.S. shoppers spent $14.2 billion, up 11% year-over-year, according to Adobe Analytics. Top cosmetics brands can charge high prices and often do not offer steep discounts on Prime Day compared with electronics, apparel and home goods. This year, Adobe Analytics expects beauty product discounts to have ""milder"" discounts of 10% to 17%, whereas electronics deals are expected to range from 14% to 22% off, said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. That, coupled with the ease of shipping small packages of most products, means that Amazon Premium Beauty merchandise has higher margins than other products sold on Prime Day. Amazon ‚Äúdoesn't make a huge margin in most of the categories of stuff that it sells online,‚Äù said Renee Parker, co-founder of consultancy firm Invinci and a former Amazon executive. ""They are making a lot of money on premium beauty products because ... (they're) small and expensive, and you can ship a ton of them.‚Äù Vitamins and supplements are successful for similar reasons. Amazon Premium Beauty sales gathered steam after the e-commerce giant began clamping down on counterfeits and top beauty companies needed new ways to reach customers, said Alfonso Emanuele de Leon, a beauty industry veteran and partner at FA Hong Kong Consultancy. Amazon was previously viewed as a pariah by luxury beauty brands because of the cheap merchandise on the website, but is no longer perceived that way, said Emanuele de Leon. 'HUGE ACCELERATION' Sales at Amazon Premium Beauty rose by nearly 20% to $15 billion between April 2024 and April 2025, outpacing the 14% growth for beauty products outside the specialized e-commerce store, according to NielsenIQ. It also outpaced the year-over-year growth of 5% for online store sales in the first quarter, NielsenIQ said. L'Oreal Chief Executive Nicolas Hieronimus said during the company's annual meeting in April that having products on Amazon led to a ""huge acceleration"" in expanding its U.S. market share. Estee Lauder has launched 11 brands on Amazon's U.S. site since March 2024. More than 75% of Estee's finished goods sold in the U.S. originate from the U.S. or Canada and are therefore protected by existing trade agreements, Roberto Canevari, Estee Lauder's global supply chain executive vice president, said at a conference in June. Lauren Gordon, vice president of Amazon at Estee Lauder, said that Prime Day and Amazon's other ""high-traffic shopping moments"" give the company a chance to ""attract both new and existing customers."" Melis del Rey, general manager for health and beauty for Amazon U.S. stores, said her team has been ""very proactive"" in working with premium brands to determine tariff impacts. ""At a high level, most of the premium brands' sourcing strategies are local, and therefore, the (tariff) impact is less imminent,"" del Rey said. Amazon Premium Beauty is an invite-only program for brands shipped and sold by Amazon and third-party sellers. The department has grown to more than 10,000 products, and brands' eligibility is determined on a case-by-case basis. Brands like Dyson and Estee Lauder's Aveda pay an extra 15% commission to Amazon for every website sale, and the third-party seller approach allows major brands to control pricing and inventory. Adding prestige brands including Unilever's ULVR Dermalogica has helped the company compete with beauty retailers Ulta Beauty ULTA and Sephora, which is owned by LVMH MC, and also attract older, higher-income shoppers at a time when TikTok Shop is scooping up younger customers."

""Beauty has become, in the past few years, more of an essential item in consumers' minds,"" even in hard financial times, said Anna Mayo, vice president of NielsenIQ's Beauty Vertical unit. Amazon Premium Beauty was initially shunned by luxury cosmetic players who feared the platform would harm their image when it was launched in 2013. But those days are gone. Now, the online retailer is promoting products from top beauty and haircare brands including Estee Lauder's Clinique, Olaplex and L¬¥Oreal¬¥s Urban Decay. During last year's Prime Day event, U.S. shoppers spent $14.2 billion, up 11% year-over-year, according to Adobe Analytics. Top cosmetics brands can charge high prices and often do not offer steep discounts on Prime Day compared with electronics, apparel and home goods. This year, Adobe Analytics expects beauty product discounts to have ""milder"" discounts of 10% to 17%, whereas electronics deals are expected to range from 14% to 22% off, said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. That, coupled with the ease of shipping small packages of most products, means that Amazon Premium Beauty merchandise has higher margins than other products sold on Prime Day. Amazon ""doesn't make a huge margin in most of the categories of stuff that it sells online,"" said Renee Parker, co-founder of consultancy firm Invinci and a former Amazon executive. ""They are making a lot of money on premium beauty products because ... (they¬¥re) small and expensive, and you can ship a ton of them."" Vitamins and supplements are successful for similar reasons. Amazon Premium Beauty sales gathered steam after the e-commerce giant began clamping down on counterfeits and top beauty companies needed new ways to reach customers, said Alfonso Emanuele de Leon, a beauty industry veteran and partner at FA Hong Kong Consultancy. Amazon was previously viewed as a pariah by luxury beauty brands because of the cheap merchandise on the website, but is no longer perceived that way, said Emanuele de Leon. 'HUGE ACCELERATION' Sales at Amazon Premium Beauty rose by nearly 20% to $15 billion between April 2024 and April 2025, outpacing the 14% growth for beauty products outside the specialized e-commerce store, according to NielsenIQ. It also outpaced the year-over-year growth of 5% for online store sales in the first quarter, NielsenIQ said. L'Oreal Chief Executive Nicolas Hieronimus said during the company's annual meeting in April that having products on Amazon led to a ""huge acceleration"" in expanding its U.S. market share. Estee Lauder has launched 11 brands on Amazon¬¥s U.S. site since March 2024. More than 75% of Estee's finished goods sold in the U.S. originate from the U.S. or Canada and are therefore protected by existing trade agreements, Roberto Canevari, Estee Lauder's global supply chain executive vice president, said at a conference in June. Lauren Gordon, vice president of Amazon at Estee Lauder, said that Prime Day and Amazon's other ""high-traffic shopping moments"" give the company a chance to ""attract both new and existing customers."" Melis del Rey, general manager for health and beauty for Amazon U.S. stores, said her team has been ""very proactive"" in working with premium brands to determine tariff impacts. ""At a high level, most of the premium brands' sourcing strategies are local, and therefore, the (tariff) impact is less imminent,"" del Rey said. Amazon Premium Beauty is an invite-only program for brands shipped and sold by Amazon and third-party sellers. The department has grown to more than 10,000 products, and brands' eligibility is determined on a case-by-case basis. Brands like Dyson and Estee Lauder's Aveda pay an extra 15% commission to Amazon for every website sale, and the third-party seller approach allows major brands to control pricing and inventory. Adding prestige brands including Unilever¬¥s Dermalogica has helped the company compete with beauty retailers Ulta Beauty and Sephora, which is owned by LVMH , and also attract older, higher-income shoppers at a time when TikTok Shop is scooping up younger customers.

President Donald Trump's tariffs have spurred some Amazon sellers who source products from China and other heavily tariffed countries to bow out of the company's Prime Day, one of its biggest sales events of the year, to protect their margins. Amazon Prime Day is now a four-day shopping event exclusively for Amazon Prime members, taking place this year from July 8 to July 11. The Seattle-based e-commerce company is hoping that recent sales growth in high-margin cosmetics in its Amazon Premium Beauty category will cushion the impact of tariffs on Prime Day sales revenue and consumer sentiment. ""Beauty has become, in the past few years, more of an essential item in consumers' minds, "" even in hard financial times, said Anna Mayo, vice president of NielsenIQ's Beauty Vertical unit. Amazon Premium Beauty was initially shunned by luxury cosmetic players who feared the platform would harm their image when it was launched in 2013. But those days are gone. Now, the online retailer is promoting products from top beauty and haircare brands including Estee Lauder's Clinique, Olaplex and L'Oreal's Urban Decay. During last year's Prime Day event, U.S. shoppers spent $14.2 billion, up 11% year-over-year, according to Adobe Analytics. Top cosmetics brands can charge high prices and often do not offer steep discounts on Prime Day compared with electronics, apparel and home goods. This year, Adobe Analytics expects beauty product discounts to have ""milder "" discounts of 10% to 17%, whereas electronics deals are expected to range from 14% to 22% off, said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. That, coupled with the ease of shipping small packages of most products, means that Amazon Premium Beauty merchandise has higher margins than other products sold on Prime Day. Amazon ‚Äúdoesn't make a huge margin in most of the categories of stuff that it sells online,‚Äù said Renee Parker, co-founder of consultancy firm Invinci and a former Amazon executive. ""They are making a lot of money on premium beauty products because ... (they're) small and expensive, and you can ship a ton of them.‚Äù Vitamins and supplements are successful for similar reasons. Amazon Premium Beauty sales gathered steam after the e-commerce giant began clamping down on counterfeits and top beauty companies needed new ways to reach customers, said Alfonso Emanuele de Leon, a beauty industry veteran and partner at FA Hong Kong Consultancy. Amazon was previously viewed as a pariah by luxury beauty brands because of the cheap merchandise on the website, but is no longer perceived that way, said Emanuele de Leon. 'HUGE ACCELERATION' Sales at Amazon Premium Beauty rose by nearly 20% to $15 billion between April 2024 and April 2025, outpacing the 14% growth for beauty products outside the specialized e-commerce store, according to NielsenIQ. It also outpaced the year-over-year growth of 5% for online store sales in the first quarter, NielsenIQ said. L'Oreal Chief Executive Nicolas Hieronimus said during the company's annual meeting in April that having products on Amazon led to a ""huge acceleration "" in expanding its U.S. market share. Estee Lauder has launched 11 brands on Amazon's U.S. site since March 2024. More than 75% of Estee's finished goods sold in the U.S. originate from the U.S. or Canada and are therefore protected by existing trade agreements, Roberto Canevari, Estee Lauder's global supply chain executive vice president, said at a conference in June. Lauren Gordon, vice president of Amazon at Estee Lauder, said that Prime Day and Amazon's other ""high-traffic shopping moments "" give the company a chance to ""attract both new and existing customers."" Melis del Rey, general manager for health and beauty for Amazon U.S. stores, said her team has been ""very proactive "" in working with premium brands to determine tariff impacts. ""At a high level, most of the premium brands' sourcing strategies are local, and therefore, the (tariff) impact is less imminent, "" del Rey said. Amazon Premium Beauty is an invite-only program for brands shipped and sold by Amazon and third-party sellers. The department has grown to more than 10,000 products, and brands' eligibility is determined on a case-by-case basis. Brands like Dyson and Estee Lauder's Aveda pay an extra 15% commission to Amazon for every website sale, and the third-party seller approach allows major brands to control pricing and inventory. Adding prestige brands including Unilever's Dermalogica has helped the company compete with beauty retailers Ulta Beauty and Sephora, which is owned by LVMH, and also attract older, higher-income shoppers at a time when TikTok Shop is scooping up younger customers.

Luxury goods. US President Donald Trump's tariffs have spurred some Amazon sellers who source products from China and other heavily tariffed countries to bow out of the company's Prime Day, one of its biggest sales events of the year, to protect their margins. Amazon Prime Day is now a four-day shopping event exclusively for Amazon Prime members, taking place this year from July 8 to July 11. The Seattle-based e-commerce company is hoping that recent sales growth in high-margin cosmetics in its Amazon Premium Beauty category will cushion the impact of tariffs on Prime Day sales revenue and consumer sentiment. Recommended For You ""Beauty has become, in the past few years, more of an essential item in consumers' minds,"" even in hard financial times, said Anna Mayo, vice president of NielsenIQ's Beauty Vertical unit. Amazon Premium Beauty was initially shunned by luxury cosmetic players who feared the platform would harm their image when it was launched in 2013. But those days are gone. Now, the online retailer is promoting products from top beauty and haircare brands including Estee Lauder's Clinique, Olaplex and L'Oreal's Urban Decay. During last year's Prime Day event, US shoppers spent $14.2 billion, up 11% year-over-year, according to Adobe Analytics. Top cosmetics brands can charge high prices and often do not offer steep discounts on Prime Day compared with electronics, apparel and home goods. This year, Adobe Analytics expects beauty product discounts to have ""milder"" discounts of 10% to 17%, whereas electronics deals are expected to range from 14% to 22% off, said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. That, coupled with the ease of shipping small packages of most products, means that Amazon Premium Beauty merchandise has higher margins than other products sold on Prime Day.

Now, the online retailer is promoting products from top beauty and haircare brands including Estee Lauder's Clinique, Olaplex and L'Oreal's Urban Decay. During last year's Prime Day event, U.S. shoppers spent $14.2 billion, up 11% year-over-year, according to Adobe Analytics. Top cosmetics brands can charge high prices and often do not offer steep discounts on Prime Day compared with electronics, apparel and home goods. This year, Adobe Analytics expects beauty product discounts to have ‚Äúmilder‚Äù discounts of 10% to 17%, whereas electronics deals are expected to range from 14% to 22% off, said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights.

""La belleza se convirti√≥, en los √∫ltimos a√±os, en un elemento m√°s esencial en la mente de los consumidores"", incluso en tiempos financieros dif√≠ciles, sostuvo Anna Mayo, vicepresidenta de la unidad vertical de belleza de NielsenIQ. Cuando Amazon Premium Beauty se lanz√≥ en 2013, fue rechazada por varias marcas de cosm√©ticos de lujo, preocupadas por el posible da√±o a su imagen. Sin embargo, actualmente, la tienda en l√≠nea exhibe productos de reconocidas marcas de belleza y cuidado capilar como Clinique, de Est√©e Lauder, Olaplex y Urban Decay, de L'Or√©al. Por este motivo, los productos pueden tener precios elevados y publicarse sin grandes descuentos durante el Prime Day. Adem√°s, son f√°ciles de enviar a los domicilios de los consumidores. ""Amazon est√°¬†ganando mucho dinero con productos de belleza premium porque... son peque√±os y caros, y se pueden enviar toneladas"", coment√≥ Renee Parker, cofundadora de la consultora Invinci y exejecutiva de Amazon. En detalle, las ventas de Amazon Premium Beauty crecieron cerca de un 20% entre abril de 2024 y abril de 2025, alcanzando los USD 15.000 millones, seg√∫n NielsenIQ. Este incremento super√≥ tanto el crecimiento del 14% registrado por los productos de belleza fuera de la tienda online especializada, como el aumento interanual del 5% en las ventas generales de comercio electr√≥nico durante el primer trimestre. Invertir en Amazon desde Argentina Para¬†invertir en¬†Amazon¬†de manera r√°pida y sencilla, solo basta con abrir una cuenta comitente en una sociedad de bolsa regulada por la Comisi√≥n Nacional de Valores como lo es¬†Bull Market Brokers, proceso gratuito que no llevar√° m√°s de cinco minutos, y, tras depositar los fondos deseados, adquirir¬†Cedears. Los¬†Cedears o Certificados de Dep√≥sito Argentinos¬†son instrumentos que equivalen a comprar la acci√≥n subyacente que cotiza en el exterior (NASDAQ: AMZN), pero se pueden operar en pesos (BCBA: AMZN) y siguen la evoluci√≥n del d√≥lar CCL, por lo que permiten evadir el riesgo argentino y, a la vez, cubrirse de un eventual salto cambiario."

urn:li:share:7342947938442117120,2025-06-23 16:13:34,en,LINKEDIN,"‚Äâ If you haven't heard of Amazon Premium Beauty, that's okay. You've probably heard of many of the brands like Aveda or The Ordinary that are listed in the department, which is set to compete with SEPHORA and Ulta Beauty. Amazon Premium Beauty could be the e-commerce giant's buffer against tariff impacts this #PrimeDay, which is slated for July 8 through July 11. Melis del Rey, general manager for health and beauty for Amazon U.S. stores, said her team has been ""very proactive"" in working with premium brands to determine #tariff impacts. ""At a high level, most of the premium brands' sourcing strategies are local, and therefore, the (tariff) impact is less imminent,"" del Rey said. The Seattle-based e-commerce company is hoping that recent sales growth in high-margin cosmetics in its Amazon Premium Beauty category will cushion the impact of tariffs on Prime Day sales revenue and consumer sentiment. ""Beauty has become, in the past few years, more of an essential item in consumers' minds,"" even in hard financial times, said Anna Mayo, vice president of NielsenIQ's Beauty Vertical unit. Amazon Premium Beauty was initially shunned by luxury cosmetic players who feared the platform would harm their image when it was launched in 2013. But those days are gone. Now, the online retailer is promoting products from top beauty and haircare brands including¬†The Est√©e Lauder Companies Inc.'s¬†Clinique, OLAPLEX¬†¬†and¬†L'Or√©al's Urban Decay. Amazon was previously viewed as a pariah by luxury beauty brands because of the cheap merchandise on the website, but is no longer perceived that way, said Alfonso Emanuele (de Leon). During last year's Prime Day event, U.S.¬†shoppers spent $14.2 billion, up 11% year-over-year, according to Adobe Analytics. Top cosmetics brands can charge high prices and often do not offer steep discounts on Prime Day compared with electronics, apparel and home goods. This year, Adobe Analytics expects beauty product discounts to have ""milder"" discounts of 10% to 17%, whereas electronics deals are expected to range from 14% to 22% off, said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights. Amazon ‚Äúdoesn't make a huge margin in most of the categories of stuff that it sells online,‚Äù said Renee Parker, co-founder of consultancy firm Invinci and a former Amazon executive. ""They are making a lot of money on premium beauty products because ... (they're) small and expensive, and you can ship a ton of them.‚Äù Read more from me at Reuters: https://lnkd.in/ezfF3mJa"
mov_7169B16183272769C9C3B02DBE8636BF,2025-06-23 18:42:05,es,WEB,"‚Äâ SPR_COMBO[es]Los aranceles del presidente Donald Trump han impulsado a algunos vendedores de Amazon que se abastecen de productos de China y otros pa√≠ses fuertemente arancelarios a retirarse del Prime Day de la compa√±√≠a, uno de sus mayores eventos de ventas del a√±o, para proteger sus m√°rgenes. Amazon Prime Day es ahora un evento de compras de cuatro d√≠as exclusivo para miembros de Amazon Prime, que este a√±o tendr√° lugar del 8 al 11 de julio. La compa√±√≠a de comercio electr√≥nico con sede en Seattle espera que el reciente crecimiento de las ventas de cosm√©ticos de alto margen en su categor√≠a Amazon Premium Beauty amortig√ºe el impacto de los aranceles en los ingresos por ventas del Prime Day y la confianza de los consumidores. ‚ÄúLa belleza se ha convertido, en los √∫ltimos a√±os, en un elemento esencial en la mente de los consumidores‚Äù, incluso en tiempos financieros dif√≠ciles, dijo Anna Mayo, vicepresidenta de la unidad Beauty Vertical de NielsenIQ. Amazon Premium Beauty fue inicialmente rechazada por los actores de cosm√©ticos de lujo que tem√≠an que la plataforma da√±ara su imagen cuando se lanz√≥ en 2013. Pero esos d√≠as ya pasaron. Ahora, el minorista en l√≠nea est√° promocionando productos de las principales marcas de belleza y cuidado del cabello, incluida Est√©e Lauder's, Clinique, Olaplex y Urban Decay de L'Oreal. Durante el evento Prime Day del a√±o pasado, los compradores estadounidenses gastaron 14,200 millones de d√≥lares, un 11% m√°s que el a√±o anterior, seg√∫n Adobe Analytics. Las principales marcas de cosm√©ticos pueden cobrar precios altos y, a menudo, no ofrecen grandes descuentos en Prime Day en comparaci√≥n con la electr√≥nica, la ropa y los art√≠culos para el hogar. Este a√±o, Adobe Analytics espera que los descuentos en productos de belleza tengan descuentos ‚Äúm√°s suaves‚Äù del 10% al 17%, mientras que se espera que las ofertas de electr√≥nica oscilen entre el 14% y el 22%, dijo Vivek Pandya, analista principal de Adobe Digital Insights. Eso, junto con la facilidad de enviar paquetes peque√±os de la mayor√≠a de los productos, significa que la mercanc√≠a de Amazon Premium Beauty tiene m√°rgenes m√°s altos que otros productos vendidos en Prime Day. Amazon ‚Äúno tiene un gran margen en la mayor√≠a de las categor√≠as de cosas que vende en l√≠nea‚Äù, dijo Renee Parker, cofundadora de la consultora Invinci y ex ejecutiva de Amazon. ‚ÄúEst√°n ganando mucho dinero con productos de belleza premium porque‚Ä¶ (Son) peque√±os y caros, y puedes enviar una tonelada de ellos‚Äù. Las vitaminas y los suplementos tienen √©xito por razones similares. Te puede interesar: Las ventas de Amazon Premium Beauty cobraron fuerza despu√©s de que el gigante del comercio electr√≥nico comenz√≥ a tomar medidas dr√°sticas contra las falsificaciones y las principales empresas de belleza necesitaban nuevas formas de llegar a los clientes, dijo Alfonso Emanuele de Le√≥n, un veterano de la industria de la belleza y socio de FA Hong Kong Consultancy. Anteriormente, Amazon era visto como un paria por las marcas de belleza de lujo debido a la mercanc√≠a barata en el sitio web, pero ya no se percibe de esa manera, dijo Emanuele de Leon. Las ventas de Amazon Premium Beauty aumentaron casi un 20% hasta los 15,000 millones de d√≥lares entre abril de 2024 y abril de 2025, superando el crecimiento del 14% de los productos de belleza fuera de la tienda especializada en comercio electr√≥nico, seg√∫n NielsenIQ. Tambi√©n super√≥ el crecimiento interanual del 5% de las ventas de las tiendas online en el primer trimestre, seg√∫n NielsenIQ. El presidente ejecutivo de L'Oreal, Nicolas Hieronimus, dijo durante la reuni√≥n anual de la compa√±√≠a en abril que tener productos en Amazon llev√≥ a una ‚Äúenorme aceleraci√≥n‚Äù en la expansi√≥n de su participaci√≥n en el mercado estadounidense. Est√©e Lauder ha lanzado 11 marcas en el sitio de Amazon en Estados Unidos desde marzo de 2024. M√°s del 75% de los productos terminados de Estee vendidos en los EU se originan en los EU o Canad√° y, por lo tanto, est√°n protegidos por los acuerdos comerciales existentes, dijo Roberto Canevari, vicepresidente ejecutivo de la cadena de suministro global de Estee Lauder, en una conferencia en junio. Lauren Gordon, vicepresidenta de Amazon en Est√©e Lauder, dijo que Prime Day y los otros ‚Äúmomentos de compras de alto tr√°fico‚Äù de Amazon le dan a la compa√±√≠a la oportunidad de ‚Äúatraer tanto a clientes nuevos como a los existentes‚Äù. Melis del Rey, gerente general de salud y belleza de las tiendas de Amazon en Estados Unidos, dijo que su equipo ha sido ‚Äúmuy proactivo‚Äù al trabajar con marcas premium para determinar los impactos arancelarios. ‚ÄúA un alto nivel, la mayor√≠a de las estrategias de abastecimiento de las marcas premium son locales y, por lo tanto, el impacto (arancelario) es menos inminente‚Äù, dijo del Rey. Amazon Premium Beauty es un programa solo por invitaci√≥n para marcas enviadas y vendidas por Amazon y vendedores externos. El departamento ha crecido a m√°s de 10,000 productos, y la elegibilidad de las marcas se determina caso por caso. Marcas como Dyson y Aveda de Estee Lauder pagan una comisi√≥n adicional del 15% a Amazon por cada venta en el sitio web, y el enfoque de vendedor externo permite a las principales marcas controlar los precios y el inventario. Marcas de prestigio como Unilever han ayudado a la compa√±√≠a a competir con los minoristas de belleza Ulta Beauty y Sephora, que es propiedad de LVMH. Con informaci√≥n de Reuters."

mzehroq,2025-06-23 21:24:11,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ 1. Everything breaks hydrogen bonds, water, heat, movement, entropy. Telling people that citric acid has some noticeable bond building effect is marketing hocus pocus. It's put in systems to lower the pH so the cationic surfactants will stick better to hair. Citric acid is washed down the drain. 2. In the context of a hair conditioner, glycolic acid is doing nothing except providing a marketing story & way to talk about old products in a new way. This LOREAL product has cationic surfactant's & Amodimethicone (silicone). Those are the ingredients that smooth hair. The glycolic acid is just a story not having any effect. https://www.lorealparis.ca/en-ca/hair-expertise/glycolic-gloss/lamination-rinse-off#:~:text=This%20lamination%20treatment%2C%20also%20known,to%2010%20washes.%20%22%2C%20%22. Honestly, you can call anything a ‚Äúbond builder‚Äù. Water builds bonds! No, it's not dangerous to mix glycolic & citric acid in a cosmetic products. 3. Since bond building can mean lots of different things, sure you could call glycerin or any humectant a bond builder. Van der Waals forces, hydrogen bonds‚Ä¶glycerin would do that. For a consumer, knowing about all the different bond builders is really not helpful. It's ‚Äúsciencewashing‚Äù designed to make consumers see innovation & differences where there are none. At least none that would make a noticeable difference to a consumer. Olaplex, K18 and all the rest play up their bond building technologies, but then include traditional cationic surfactants, polymers & silicones in their products to get the real effects. Citric acid has been used in hair products since the 1950's. This is not new technology. The reality is there hasn't been any significant, consumer perceptible advancements in hair care products (shampoos, conditioners or treatments) in the last 30 years. Almost all the innovation is in the marketing stories that are told."

AMZN is turning to luxury beauty products as a way to offset the impact of tariffs during its upcoming Prime Day sale. What To Know: Under pressure from the new tariffs introduced by President Donald Trump, some sellers who source their goods from China and other countries facing high tariffs are choosing not to participate in Prime Day in order to protect their profit margins. AST SpaceMobile Stock Downgraded, Rocket Lab Prepares Electron Launch: Space Stock Countdown As a result, Amazon is placing greater emphasis on its Premium Beauty category, which features high-margin cosmetics and luxury brands, to help make up for potential revenue shortfalls and maintain positive consumer sentiment. Melis del Rey, general manager for health and beauty for Amazon U.S. stores, told Reuters that the company has been ‚Äúvery proactive‚Äù in determining the impact of tariffs on the premium brands. ‚ÄúAt a high level, most of the premium brands' sourcing strategies are local, and therefore, the (tariff) impact is less imminent,‚Äù del Rey said. Why It Matters: Prime Day, one of Amazon's largest annual sales events, will be stretched to four days from July 8 to July 11, 2025. The company is betting that the strong growth in its Premium Beauty segment ‚Äî where brands from Estee Lauder Companies, Inc. EL such as Clinique; Olaplex Holdings, Inc. OLPX and L'Oreal's LRLCF Urban Decay are now prominent ‚Äî will help buffer the financial effects of the tariffs. Luxury beauty products tend to have higher profit margins, are less likely to be heavily discounted compared to electronics or apparel and are often still considered essential purchases by consumers, even during tough economic times.

mov_479DBC523E15151657369A0D1D029B5C,2025-06-24 10:01:36,en,WEB,"‚Äâ As tariffs imposed under former U.S. President Donald Trump continue to impact goods sourced from China and other countries, Amazon is leaning on high-margin luxury beauty products to bolster sales during its upcoming Prime Day event, set for July 8‚Äì11. ALSO READ With some Amazon sellers choosing to sit out this year's Prime Day due to margin pressures from tariffs, the company is focusing on its growing Amazon Premium Beauty category to cushion the revenue impact. This segment, which includes cosmetics and personal care items, has become a strong performer due to its high margins and consumer resilience, even during economic uncertainty. ‚ÄúBeauty has become, in the past few years, more of an essential item in consumers' minds,‚Äù said Anna Mayo, Vice President of NielsenIQ's Beauty Vertical. Initially avoided by luxury brands concerned about image dilution, Amazon's Premium Beauty program has gained credibility and now features well-known names such as Est√©e Lauder's Clinique, Olaplex, and L'Or√©al's Urban Decay. Amazon has made efforts to reduce counterfeiting and build trust with both consumers and high-end brands. Sales in the Premium Beauty category rose nearly 20% to $15 billion between April 2024 and April 2025, outpacing the 14% growth in the broader beauty sector and significantly exceeding the 5% year-over-year growth of online store sales overall, according to NielsenIQ. Amazon's strategy hinges on the fact that luxury beauty products are small, high-value, and easy to ship, which helps maintain strong margins. ‚ÄúThey are making a lot of money on premium beauty products because they're small and expensive, and you can ship a ton of them,‚Äù said Renee Parker, co-founder of consultancy firm Invinci and a former Amazon executive. ALSO READ Discounts in the beauty segment are expected to be milder than in other categories this Prime Day. According to Adobe Analytics, beauty items may see discounts of 10% to 17%, while electronics are expected to offer 14% to 22% off. The shift toward premium cosmetics has been helped by brands localising their supply chains. Est√©e Lauder, for instance, sources over 75% of its U.S. goods from the U.S. or Canada, shielding it from tariffs. The company has launched 11 brands on Amazon's U.S. platform since March 2024. Lauren Gordon, Vice President of Amazon at Est√©e Lauder, noted that Prime Day and other major Amazon sales events provide a valuable opportunity to connect with both new and existing customers. Amazon's Premium Beauty is an invite-only program that includes both first-party and third-party sellers, featuring more than 10,000 products. Brands such as Dyson and Aveda also participate, though terms with these companies are not publicly disclosed. The move strengthens Amazon's position against competitors like Ulta Beauty and Sephora, owned by LVMH, while helping the retailer attract older and higher-income demographics. At the same time, platforms like TikTok Shop are drawing in younger consumers. Melis del Rey, General Manager for Health and Beauty at Amazon U.S. stores, said the team has worked closely with premium brands to manage the effects of tariffs. ‚ÄúAt a high level, most of the premium brands' sourcing strategies are local, and therefore, the (tariff) impact is less imminent,‚Äù she said. Last year, U.S. shoppers spent $14.2 billion during Prime Day, up 11% year-over-year, according to Adobe Analytics. With Premium Beauty sales accelerating and tariffs reshaping sourcing strategies, Amazon is betting that luxury products will help sustain momentum during one of its most important shopping events of the year."
mzinxel,2025-06-24 14:27:37,en,REDDIT,‚Äâ One of my favorite shampoo and conditioner sets for low porosity hair is the Joico moisturizer rescue line. They sell it at Marshalls and TJ maxx for less than they do in salons. Texture ID also has a low porosity line that has an amazing shampoo. I'm not a fan of the conditioner. The shampoo has great slip and aloe for moisture. If you are going to keep your hair in protective styles make sure to moisturize about two to 3 times a week. Our hair loves water so spray some first before applying the moisturizer. I would say for damage go with a pre shampoo treatment. Now I just learned something about these treatments. They are actually supposed to be applied after shampooing and before conditioner for best results. Olaplex originally marketed the product this way but the general public kept using it wrong. They were using it as a conditioner and giving it bad reviews. Instead they told people just do it before shampooing. It really should be applied on clean hair though. I use the one by Garnier and it is a great dupe for the Olaplex. There are a lot of dupes for that product so you will be able to find one easily. One thing you can do since you are in a cold area is invest in a hair steamer. They have them on Amazon. This will help infuse moisture into your hair even on days that aren't wash day. I don't have any style recommendations unfortunately.

mov_5B854FDECE3B6729DCE4BBD8EB6BF888,2025-06-25 20:33:21,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Amazon Prime Day isn't just another sale. It's a full-blown internet event. It's the one time a year when shoppers actually look forward to filling their carts. Calendars get marked. Wishlists get built. Everyone from budget-savvy moms to TikTok creators goes on high alert. But this year, Prime Day might feel a little off. Behind the scenes, some sellers are bailing. Not because they want to...but because they can't afford to show up. Because of President Donald Trump's proposed tariffs on goods from China and other import-heavy regions, Amazon sellers who rely on overseas manufacturing are in a bind. Related: Amazon's latest products go after a new type of customer For them, participating in Prime Day means slashing prices and taking a hit on costs. That's a margin killer. And when key sellers back out, Amazon feels the pressure, too. Prime Day is one of its biggest moneymakers of the year. It can't risk losing steam. So what does the e-commerce giant do? Well, it may not need to do much at all. Because one surprising category is already stepping up. It's small. It's shippable. It's high-margin. And it just might be the beast behind Prime Day 2025. With tariffs looming, one Amazon category gains ground Tariffs are already changing how Prime Day looks this year, and sellers are responding by stepping back. Some who typically offer big discounts are skipping the event altogether. Others are pulling back on promotions to protect what little margin they have left. That's not great news for Amazon. Prime Day thrives on flashy, big-ticket deals. But there's a silver lining, and it's not electronics or home goods. It's beauty. Amazon's Premium Beauty category has grown nearly 20% year-over-year, hitting $15 billion between April 2024 and April 2025, according to NielsenIQ. Related: This new AI tool could change how you shop for makeup That growth outpaces the broader beauty market and Amazon's own online store sales, which only rose 5% in Q1. This isn't a fluke. Prestige brands that once avoided Amazon are now embracing the platform. According to Business of Fashion , Est√©e Lauder has launched 11 brands since March 2024. Olaplex , Urban Decay , and even Dyson are now part of the mix. And while most categories will see deeper discounts, Adobe Analytics predicts beauty will hold steady, with only 10 to 17% markdowns. That means better margins for Amazon, and fewer reasons to panic as other categories start to wobble. Why beauty may (or may not) be Amazon's Prime Day secret weapon What makes beauty such a strong category right now? For Amazon, it's the perfect mix. Small, expensive, and easy to ship. Beauty doesn't need deep discounts to move, and buyers are used to paying a premium. Many of these products are also made domestically. That matters a lot, since it helps them avoid the extra cost of tariffs and delays. Traditional Prime Day staples like TVs and kitchen gear may struggle. Beauty, on the other hand, is holding steady. High margins, steady demand, and growing consumer trust are giving it a real edge...."

National Canoe Day (Canada) ‚û°Ô∏è How to Build and Furnish a Log Cabin National Log Cabin Day -- A day to remember that quieter and simpler era when life was more rugged. Historically, most Log cabins were simple one or 1¬Ω-story structures, somewhat impermanent, and less finished or less architecturally sophisticated. A log cabin was usually constructed with round rather than hewn, or hand-worked, logs, and often it was the first generation home building erected quickly for frontier shelter. Read: How to Build and Furnish a Log Cabin , by W. Ben Hunt -- W. Ben Hunt's classic has earned a reputation as the authentic handbook since it was first published in 1939. Updated in 1974, it remains the only step-by-step guide to building log cabins and log furniture -- pioneer style. There are other manuals on building cabins, but W. Ben Hunt is the only one to show you how to build and furnish an authentic pioneer cabin - the easy, natural way, using only hand tools and the woods around you. Our ancestors used logs and hand tools to build durable, dry, windproof, and protective dwellings, and they fashioned chairs, tables, branches, and bushes. In this day of power saws, lumberyards, and high prices, it's good to know that you can build in the same way. Log Cabin Kings Log Cabin Kings -- The finest log homes on earth are custom-built by the men and women of Pioneer Log Homes. These master log-smiths and artisans handcraft each home on their log yard, take them apart, and then ship the homes all around the world to be reconstructed wherever their clients want. No one has ever built homes quite like the Log Cabin Kings. Lincoln Logs Lincoln Logs -- Inspired by the Meeting House , a build from one of the first LINCOLN LOGS sets, the 100th Anniversary Tin highlights the nostalgia of LINCOLN LOGS in a set just like you remember! Parts and pieces come in a collectible tin which doubles as storage. A great set to give your favorite LINCOLN LOGS builder!

My stylist, of course, suggested I come back more often and pay the exorbitant price of the salon every other week. I don't think it was all that horrible but it was dry.

n03oguc,2025-06-27 17:38:38,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Well the oil i use is deeply hydrating for the hair shaft. That's what I meant as far as moisturize as well as locking in the pervious products moisturizing benefits so I wouldn't exactly say that it's not moisturizing on its own. As far as the protein, I barely use any products with protein, the olaplex and k18 both have very small trace amounts of protein but that's pretty much it in my routine with Protein. I really try to avoid protein unless it's right after I bleach my hair or I need a little treatment. I think my issue is really lying in the gel/curl products I'm using and also letting myself get used to having so volume which I don't love right now but need to adjust. And yes, I love the Kerastase oil. Especially on dry hair. But the capsules from Amazon with avacado oil, Moroccan oil, macadamia oil and a bunch of other beneficial ingredients is extremely hydrating and also really good. I like to use that more on wet hair."

Avoid over styling your hair with heat tools, but plan to at least blow dry your hair on warm as air drying can cause further damage/breakage.

There are usually really good deals for lightener and developer on shop pay or google shopping for Schwarzkopf Blondme I recommend the large 9+ lift lightener and 20vol, it should definitely get you to the level you want, and if you are worried about damage, you could throw some Olaplex in the mix, but their product is so good you really do not need it. But if you do add a bond builder or protector, add extra time for it to develop, and check your hair throughout the processes, and use your bleach right away once you mix it. If it starts to swell in the bowl, toss it and mix a new batch to keep it fresh. To get good results it's best to be as quick as possible so the bleach doesn't lose power, but that is easier said than done for DIY. Good luck! (I have to do my roots myself today or tomorrow, not looking forward to it.) (I have level 4-5 brown roots and level 10 platinum on the rest of my head.)"

mov_A883CB9A5F6F0D881DB6D501017D5590,2025-07-01 17:35:42,en,WEB,"‚Äâ July 1st, 2025 ( National Law Review  - Delivered by  Newstex ) Article By Kimberly A. Berger Anita C. Marinelli Miller CanfieldMiller Canfield Resources The Made in the USA label carries significant marketing weight, especially in today's political landscape, but it also comes with legal risks. Federal regulators and class action attorneys are scrutinizing origin claims, leading major brands to face substantial penalties. The primary enforcement avenue for the Federal Trade Commission ('FTC') is its Made in USA Labeling Rule, issued in 2021, which states that a product cannot be labeled as Made in the USA unless 'all or virtually all' of its components are made in the U.S. A corporation must have and rely on a 'reasonable basis' to back up a claim that its product was made in the U.S. There are generally two types of Made in the USA claims-qualified and unqualified. Unqualified claims,i.e.,those that do not explain or limit the extent to which a product has been made in the U.S., present the most risk for businesses. To make an unqualified Made in the USA claim, the product must be 'all or virtually all' made in the U.S. This means: (1) the final assembly or processing occurs in the U.S.; (2) all significant processing that goes into the product occurs in the U.S.; or (3) all or virtually all ingredients/components are made and sourced in the U.S. The FTC considers other factors as well, including how much of the total manufacturing costs can be assigned to the U.S., how far-removed foreign content is from the final product, and the importance of foreign content to the final product. Additionally, a product may claim to be 'Assembled in the USA' if its last 'substantial transformation' occurred in the U.S. Critically, when foreign components are assembled into a final product in the U.S., it is not a 'substantial transformation.' Qualified claimsdescribe the extent, amount or type of a product's domestic content or processing. For example, an advertisement claiming that a product includes '60% U.S. content' or was 'Made in the USA of U.S. and imported parts.' Qualified claims may be appropriate if a product 'include[s] U.S. content or processing' but otherwise fails to meet the criteria for an unqualified Made in the USA claim. Many corporations-both big and small-have faced class action lawsuits and FTC investigations regarding their claims that products are Made in the USA. As a result, companies are paying multi-million-dollar settlements: In April, a California jury hit R.C. Bigelow with a $2.36 million judgment in a class action lawsuit over its Made in the USA claims. While the company admitted to sourcing its tea from overseas, it argued that the label referred to the tea bags and assembly process. [1] In February, haircare brand Olaplex settled a lawsuit that alleged certain produces were falsely advertised as Made in the USA. Without admitting wrongdoing, Olaplex agreed to send $5 vouchers to class members in addition to paying $1.35 million in fees and costs. [2] In 2024, Williams-Sonoma paid the biggest civil penalty in a Made in the USA enforcement case by the FTC totaling $3.17 million. [3] And there are several class action lawsuits currently pending against many other companies. [4] What To Do Corporations should remember that they have an ongoing obligation to ensure that their products are correctly labeled, which also means communicating with suppliers and manufacturers. Additionally, corporations should consider their use of U.S. imagery on their products to avoid making an implied Made in the USA claim without substantiation. [1]Banks v. R.C.

n0t29qm,2025-07-01 18:46:14,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ lots of other folks have mentioned that the example picture is dimensional vs all over color. like others have said, it would be better to use a 20 vol developer with the lightener powder for a longer period of time, instead of using 30 volume for a shorter period of time. if you got to the strand test color in 30 mins with 30 volume, you can definitely achieve it with a longer processing time using 20 volume and you'd be less likely to cause major damage. you can process for up to an hour, so just keep checking the color while the lightener processes. my recommendation would be to lighten your entire head in sections like you said you plan to, to get to a base color similar to what your strand test looks like. if you can wait a couple days and do some deep conditioning treatments after you have your base color, that would be best. i'd then go back in with a technique like this to achieve something similar to the highlights shown in your goal picture ‚Äî she's obviously using a different tone of color here, but the takeaway of the video should be the lightener application techniques: https://youtu.be/gegncnXXxi0 pay attention to the volumes she is using ‚Äî DO NOT go back in to highlight your base with 30 volume developer, your highlights will fry. you must use a 10 volume developer and give it time to process. she also has a lot of other great videos about doing highlights if you wanna browse her channel ‚Äî again, don't focus on the color/toner shades she's using, just the bleach application techniques to help achieve the dimensional look in your example. imo, if you are okay with your base color matching your swatch, you'd be better off leaving it at that and then adding the highlights with a volume 10 developer, versus trying to lighten your whole head again. your hair would be much better off that way, versus trying to push it with another whole head application of lightener! you'd be very close to the example photo anyway after toning. sally's ion line has an olaplex dupe that you should definitely pick up. it's under $15 and one set would probably get you through 2-3 processes, so you might wanna pick up 2 boxes if your hair is thick, because it would be better to to have a little extra for next time vs. running out. here's the link, they have it in stores too: https://www.sallybeauty.com/hair-color/other-products-and-applications/fillers-and-additives/absolute-perfection-dual-kit/SBS-405019.html i'd also buy some k18 and apply it before/after processes: cheapest option here that i have been able to squeeze 2-3 applications out of in the past, but you'd be better off investing in the $30 pump bottle that's available on amazon: https://www.target.com/p/k18-leave-in-molecular-repair-hair-mask-0-17-oz/-/A-85972091 and then use a bond repairing shampoo and conditioner to help rebuild your hair integrity after all these processes. redken's bond repair line is pretty good and relatively affordable! pick up a nice serum too to keep the mids/ends healthy. if you can't invest in these products, i promise your hair would look better at whatever color it is now than lighter and unhealthy! but i think if you invest in the bond builder from sally's, k18, and a bond repairing shampoo and conditioner, your goal example is within reach. also not sure what your current base color is like or if you've done a whole head lightening process before, but make sure you understand how to apply the lightener for a whole head application so you don't end up with an uneven base color before you go back in to highlight. if you don't apply the lightener correctly you will end up with really uneven color ‚Äî lighter roots from the heat of your head accelerating the bleach, etc. here is a good video that explains how to approach whole head lightening ‚Äî as with the other example video, don't focus on the end result color, just pay attention to the techniques used to achieve an even color. adjust the processing times according to your goal base color: https://youtu.be/tYg3ZmbX5iw?si=mXSeHVLH6rBVWubP saw that you don't have sally's in your country. there are other products similar to olaplex; see if you can find ALL hd PLEX or LIW ph plex! i think you'd need to order them online. they are both similar products you will mix into the bleach and color during the color/lightening processes. this step is definitely the most important"

Ive been planning on trying the whole range so initially I brought this leave in today to test the waters. I actually did wash my hair earlier today so I couldn't use this on damp hair as it suggested. But I did use very tiny amount of it after coming home from work on dry hair at the ends. Initially the smell is divine. It smells exactly like BBW luminous. It kind of smoothened the ends. I can only imagine how smooth my hair would get if applied on damp hair. Purpose of buying this is coz chatgpt said it can perform as a dupe to k18, Olaplex focused on bond repair. If this did work really well then it's surely a very well made product at a budget price.

En ese escenario nace el Olaplex N¬∫. 10 Bond Shaper¬Æ, un producto que no solo moldea tus rizos, sino que trabaja desde adentro para reconstruir los enlaces rotos del cabello. Si has o√≠do hablar del ‚Äúsistema de reparaci√≥n molecular‚Äù de Olaplex, sabr√°s que no es una marca m√°s: es una revoluci√≥n en la industria capilar, con f√≥rmulas patentadas que han cambiado la forma de tratar el cabello da√±ado. Y su N¬∫. 10 no se queda atr√°s: es el primer gel definidor de rizos con tecnolog√≠a reparadora Bond Building. Lo que hace especial a este gel no es solo su acabado brillante, ni su capacidad de definir ondas sin apelmazarlas. Es su ingrediente estrella: el Bis-Aminopropyl Diglycol Dimaleate, el complejo molecular exclusivo de Olaplex, que reconecta los enlaces de disulfuro da√±ados por coloraci√≥n, calor o maltrato f√≠sico. Pero no solo eso: aporta fijaci√≥n flexible sin rigidez, elimina el frizz incluso con humedad alta, aumenta la elasticidad del rizo y mejora su memoria y proporciona brillo sin residuos ni acartonamiento. La textura es ligera, se funde con el cabello h√∫medo o seco, y no deja residuos pegajosos. Es ideal tanto para rizos tipo 2B como para 4C. En pruebas realizadas por usuarios: El 87 % not√≥ rizos m√°s definidos y suaves despu√©s de una sola aplicaci√≥n. El 94 % dijo tener menos frizz tras 48 horas. El 91 % sinti√≥ el cabello m√°s saludable con el uso constante durante dos semanas. Centella asi√°tica: el secreto coreano que te deja piel de porcelana, ahora en Amazon     El corrector de NYX en Amazon: skincare, maquillaje y revoluci√≥n suave por 8 euros     Ultimate Shadow Palette de Amazon: 16 razones para cancelar las sombras aburridas Adem√°s, su fragancia sutil y limpia lo convierte en una experiencia sensorial que acompa√±a el ritual de cuidado, no lo invade. Frente a gels convencionales de 10 o 15 euros que ofrecen solo fijaci√≥n temporal (y muchas veces resecan), el Olaplex N¬∫. 10 es un h√≠brido que trata, embellece y protege. En otras palabras: es skincare para tu cabello rizado. @mundistyle"

Esa es exactamente la sensaci√≥n que reproduce el Silky Glow Baked Bronzer 01 de KIKO Milano, una joya low cost que ha ganado espacio entre los imprescindibles del maquillaje diario. Y no, no necesitas vacaciones ni un filtro de Instagram para lograrlo. Por solo 11 euros en Amazon, este bronzer horneado re√∫ne todo lo que buscamos: pigmento modulable, textura suave como terciopelo y un acabado natural que simula ese glow saludable y veraniego. Este producto se ha colado en tutoriales de TikTok, rese√±as en YouTube y listas de favoritos en blogs de belleza por una raz√≥n clara: es bueno, bonito y barato. Pero adem√°s, tiene algo que los expertos valoran m√°s que nunca: versatilidad y efecto realista. Tono universal: el tono 01 aporta ese dorado sutil, sin subtonos naranjas ni efecto ‚Äúpolvo sobre polvo‚Äù. Perfecto para pieles claras a medias, y modulable en pieles m√°s profundas. Textura baked: no reseca, no marca poros ni genera parches. Se funde con la piel como un velo ligero. Acabado glow sin shimmer excesivo: es un glow ‚Äúcaro‚Äù. Ese que parece natural, que imita el rebote de la luz en tu piel. M√°s all√° del color, lo que enamora es su f√≥rmula horneada enriquecida con aceites emolientes, que hacen que aplicar este bronzer sea casi terap√©utico. Se desliza f√°cil, se difumina sin esfuerzo y no acartona. ¬øTu piel necesita reset? Esta crema sueca es el bot√≥n de reinicio, ahora en Amazon     El acondicionador bif√°sico de 5‚ÄØeuros que te desenreda el pelo y la vida, est√° en Amazon     Seis euros, un milagro capilar y cero grasa: as√≠ act√∫a el No. 6 de Olaplex en Amazon No es casualidad que muchas comparen este producto con opciones mucho m√°s caras, pero lo cierto es que el de KIKO Milano no intenta imitar a nadie: simplemente entiende lo que la piel necesita hoy. Mientras las f√≥rmulas mates y pesadas del pasado han quedado atr√°s, ahora buscamos ese acabado tipo ‚Äúclean girl makeup‚Äù o ‚Äúeffortless glow‚Äù, inspirado en modelos como Kaia Gerber o Lily Aldridge. Menos es m√°s, pero tiene que verse bien. Este bronzer es parte de ese nuevo paradigma: lujo silencioso, con resultados visibles y un precio amable. ¬øVale la pena? Por 11 euros, absolutamente. Sobre todo si consideramos que se trata de un producto multitarea, que transforma la piel opaca en un rostro vibrante sin esfuerzo ni necesidad de t√©cnica profesional. Adem√°s, al ser baked y pigmentado, te durar√° meses, incluso con uso frecuente. @mundistyle"

n15d1if,2025-07-03 16:07:27,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ It depends how much risk you're willing to take. Your hair looks thick so that's a good start. This is what I would do, but I'm sure some won't agree - really, it all depends on your hair's overall health. So I'd start with color oops from the mids to the ends and follow with a deep conditioning mask for like 10-15 minutes after rinsing. I also always do a quick lamellar water rinse, too, after rinsing out bleach / dye. Let it air dry with some kind of leave-in conditioner / something moisturizing in it overnight. Next day: bleach mids to ends with 30 vol. and mix Olaplex 3 into your bleach solution. Saturate your hair. Mix bleach in small batches as you go so it doesn't lose its potency and move as fast as possible. Then watch and wait‚Ä¶. Rinse out all the bleach in lukewarm water - your hair is going to feel rough at this point: don't panic - and then mix purple conditioner (I use matrix) with a deep conditioning mask (I use Paul Mitchell or the Wella tub) and let it sit on there for like 10-15 mins. Rinse with cool water, lamellar water, rinse well. Hair should start looking more yellow than orange at this point, but don't be surprised (or worry) if you have to do some spot correcting following the same process. I've found doing it this way somehow makes my hair feel BETTER after each bleach session than it did before‚Ä¶. i also don't wash my hair frequently - not prone to greasy hair so I guess that helps - but I think this makes it inherently stronger. I'd see where you land after doing all of the above. From there I think you could try a Pulp Riot Semi-permanent dye (they have the best colors, IMO) to even out the yellow tone, if that's what you're looking to do. I get their dyes on Amazon; think I saw a color similar to your roots. Have fun with it! Once you get to where you want to be devote a few months at least to realllllly taking care of it; splurge a little on hair/scalp health products and ‚Äúbaby‚Äù it. Good luck!"

But Let's Get Back to Prime Day  Before you start shopping, make a plan. Our philosophy when it comes to major shopping events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon Prime Day is to first consider what you need and make a list. If you don't have a plan, you could end up buying things you really don't need. Think about what you regularly shop for: snacks for the kids, batteries, cleaning supplies, etc. Then look around your house and see if you need bigger items like kitchen appliances or a new vacuum cleaner. Do the kids need anything? Outdoor toys, sports equipment, crafting kits, clothes, and back-to-school supplies come to mind. Maybe you have a wedding shower or birthday party that you need gifts for‚Äîthis is a good time to score what they want at a savings. Load up your online shopping cart now for faster checkout on the big day. While the deals are too numerous to list, we've done some of the legwork for you and rounded up what you can expect this Prime Day, broken down by category, and what you can buy right now!

n16lyqu,2025-07-03 19:42:10,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ I (23M) have had purely white platinum blonde before. Before I continue, OP I'm so glad you decided to go with getting a wig, and I'm so sorry about all the hate with these other people. From my experience, a wig is the best option, as when I finally achieved the white platinum hair, it was basically fried, and I had to refrain from doing anything to it for a while, and there was lots of broken pieces falling out when I'd wash my hair. Long story short, after I used lots of Olaplex on my hair, I decided to do black dye and have never looked back. Blonde, and especially white platinum is such a lovely color, but like others have said, it is so high maintenance and damaging. I may try again someday, but it's so important to keep the hair healthy."

n1872a7,2025-07-04 00:54:12,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Hi, pro here. The ingredients are not the same. If you put a bit of store bought shampoo in your palm can you turn it upside down? It boils down to the ph balance on what makes hair products professional or not truly. I am not personally a fan of sulfate free products. I like the active cleaning agents/bubbles. However; I will say Pantene is the worst for your hair. It has wax in it. You can literally wax your floors with it. Long term use causes a waxy build up that I've personally cut off of peoples hair shaft. It's awful and can cause much bigger issues. I can wash someone's hair and tell if they use it (often). K18 and Olaplex can be good. However, too much protein can cause breakage and frizz, you don't need it that often unless it's very damaged. Using professional products correctly is the key. Some people aren't educated in the type of hair they have and actual products or frequency of use. I should also mention, there's a lot of fakes and expired products sold with really good packaging. Unless it's sold in a professional salon (not Amazon or a grocery store) there isn't a guarantee you're actually getting the correct product. Just a food for thought from someone who's been in the industry over 20 years. Best wishes."

Un perfume que parec√≠a dise√±ado por una princesa adolescente con delirio de diva, y que termin√≥ convirti√©ndose en un icono cultural de la hiperglamourizaci√≥n. Su frasco rosa con cristales verdes parec√≠a una p√≥cima de Sailor Moon. Y su olor, una mezcla de cupcake en una noche de verano, resultaba tan escandalosamente dulce que ofend√≠a a las narices ‚Äúserias‚Äù. Pero eso era justo lo interesante. Fantasy no se disculpaba por su dulzura. La celebraba. Era un perfume que gritaba ‚Äúsoy femenina, soy pop, y no me interesa agradarte‚Äù. En un mundo que ahora finge preferir los perfumes unisex y neutros, Fantasy sobrevive como una reliquia arom√°tica que se ha convertido, ir√≥nicamente, en una pieza de culto. El blush rosad de 3 euros que deja efecto Rare Beauty perfecto y sin gastar de m√°s     El fijador de maquillaje viral de Amazon que revive delineadores y ahorra maquillaje     Rizos sin frizz, sin rigidez y con brillo: s√≠, existe, se llama Olaplex en Amazon Y no solo por el aroma, sino por lo que representa: la era Britney, la de los brillos, los excesos, el drama p√∫blico y la constante presi√≥n medi√°tica. Comprar Fantasy hoy no es solo adquirir un perfume barato, es hacer un gui√±o a una √©poca en la que las popstars eran diosas vulnerables y los fans coreaban sus nombres como himnos generacionales. Su precio es otra iron√≠a deliciosa: 18 euros por una botella que encapsula toda una est√©tica, toda una actitud. Porque en un mercado donde los perfumes de autor cuestan m√°s que un vuelo internacional, Fantasy sigue firme en su estante digital como diciendo: ‚Äúno todo lo bueno tiene que ser caro, elitista o dif√≠cil de pronunciar‚Äù. Fantasy de Britney Spears es el perfume que nadie se atreve a decir en voz alta que sigue usando. Pero ah√≠ est√°. Vibrante, dulce, ultra pop. Y en un mundo que exige madurez arom√°tica como sin√≥nimo de aburrimiento, llevar Fantasy es casi un acto de rebeld√≠a est√©tica. As√≠ que s√≠, ll√©valo. Roc√≠alo. Que tu olor diga: ‚Äúesta es mi pel√≠cula, y yo soy la protagonista pop‚Äù. @mundistyle"

CeraVe's Retinol Serum,¬†which lives up to the CeraVe name and uses *encapsulated* retinol to reduce the appearance of scars and pores without flaking or redness. If you haven't gotten into retinoids yet or are worried about irritating your skin, this gentle but effective serum is a great option ‚Äî and reviewers say they like it better than other more expensive options (like Murad's Retinol Serum, which retails for $92). And remember, like with any retinol (that actually works) *just do not use it every day. * Start slow and work yourself up if needed, paying attention to your skin. Promising review: ""I absolutely love this stuff! I saw a dermatologist on¬†TikTok¬†who raved about this product and tried it out, and it's been the most amazing stuff! It's helped my face to clear up very quickly removing all of the blemish spots and dark spots around my face. It's been one of the best products I've added to my face routine. This would be great for all ages/stages and for any weather types. It doesn't moisturize much, but that's not it's intention, and there is no scent, so I'd imagine it's great for all skin types and hypoallergenic."" ‚ÄîSuccessful Solo Promising review: ""I bought this for my teenager to use for his acne scars, but he ended up not using it. I ran out of my Murad retinol serum, so I gave this a try. I actually like it¬†better¬†than¬†the Murad! It absorbs quickly, with zero smell or irritation.

It's formulated with hyaluronic acid and squalene for a boost of hydration too! Promising review: ""This stuff is so legit I've gone through three bottles. Adds the perfect glow to your skin! Sometimes I use it under foundation, and sometimes, I use it solo with a bit of concealer. I will never not repurchase it for the price and how beautifully it sits on the skin. This stuff is viral for a reason!!"" ‚Äîmapagill Promising review: ""If you like Charlotte Tilbury Flawless Filter, this is leaps and bounds¬†better! Just buy it.

I despise how necklaces get tangled and I have to rummage through to find what I need. This stand changes everything. I love that it has a section for your rings, too. Shop Lolalet, $37.59 (usually $46.99)    Image: Amazon    Vtopmart 3 Tier Rolling Cart with Wheels    These are a gamechanger for organisation if you're tight on space. I have one in my bathroom that I use to categorise my makeup, skincare and haircare, and it's the only way I've been able to keep it all tidy. Shop Vtopmart, $31.75 (was 33.65)    Image: Amazon    Gabeeriso Corner Shower Caddy    Corner shower shelves changed my life. They don't take up as much room as traditional shower caddies, yet somehow fit more? Some could say it's math or science, I say it's magic. Shop Gabeeriso, $29.99 (usually $39.99)    Image: Amazon    Joseph Joseph EasyStore Toothbrush Caddy Large ‚Äì Grey/White    Everyone knows how precious bathroom counter space is, especially if your bathroom is tiny. So, this storage caddy from Joseph Joseph is a great way to sort all the bits and bobs that you need access to on a regular basis without turning your basin into storage. Shop Joseph Joseph, $1 9 (usually $42.95)    Image: Amazon    Jabykare 2-Tier Dish Drying Rack    Mate, would you look at this thing of beauty? Fuck wiping up when you have something as efficient and satisfying as this drying rack . It features an automatic drainboard, cutting board rack, cup rack and cutlery holder. It can hold a dozen dishes, four cups, up to 15 bowls, and heaps of spoons, forks and other smaller kitchen items. Shop Jabykare, $39.99 (usually $44.99)    Image: Amazon    Wuciray Kitchen Storage & Organisation    I swear, under every kitchen sink is just a black hole of stuff. It's all shoved in there, never to see the light of day unless you get down on your hands and knees to rummage through it. Well, rummage no more. This handy organiser has two shelves. One pulls out like a drawer to reach the stuff you need right at the back of the cupboard, and the other is a standard top shelf. It also comes with two cups and four hanging hooks to store your washcloths and brushes. Shop Wuciray, $21.75 (usually $23.11)    Image: Amazon    Toplife Expandable Pans Organiser Rack    The only thing more cluttered than the cupboard underneath your kitchen sink is the one that holds all your pots, pans and lids.

Shop Toplife, $23.12 (usually $35.90)    Image: Amazon    Quienkitch Fridge Organiser    The Diet Coke girlies on TikTok love this fridge organiser (Coke No Sugar is far better in my opinion, but that's besides the point). It has a rolling design, so the angled shelves keep the cans rolled forward for quick and easy dispensing. Shop Quienkitch, $23.99 (usually $26.29)    Image: Amazon    Vtopmart 4 Pack 2 Tier Bathroom Under Sink Organisers and Storage    The bathroom cupboard is another one of those 'let's shut the door and not talk about it' kinda cupboards. So this two-tier organiser is a great option to keep things clean, with slide-out drawers for easy access. Shop Vtopmart, $47.99 (usually $59.99)    Image: Amazon    Joseph Joseph Pocket Folding Space-Saving Table-top Ironing Board    I don't know who still irons regularly aside from our parents, but there are still those (annoying) times when you need an iron. So, this tabletop ironing board from Joseph Joseph is a really great pick. It has a compact folding design with a compartment for your iron, so it's easily stored.

Blame it on the huge selection, speedy shipping, and simple return process, but let's just say I put my Prime account to good use‚Äîespecially when it comes to beauty products. Whether it's a TikTok-viral lip stain or a cult-classic Korean essence, I've placed more orders in the last year than I'd like to admit. At the time, it was bad news for my bank account, but now, it's good news for you because I know which Amazon beauty products are actually worth ordering, and right in time for Prime Day, too. This year, Prime Day deals are happening from July 8 to 11. During the sale, Prime members can score big discounts on thousands of products, including the best of the beauty category. Excited? Me too. Keep scrolling to see my official, beauty editor‚Äìapproved shopping guide. Wonderskin Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain - Adore I have to start with a product I use almost every single day‚ÄîWonderskin's Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain. It went viral on TikTok a few months ago, and once I tested it, I could see why. Apply the dark-blue liquid to the lips (don't worry‚Äîit doesn't stay that way), wait a few minutes to let it dry, and peel it off. You'll be left with the most stunning, long-lasting lip color. You can stop there, or you can apply lip gloss over the top. I prefer the latter. It's become my go-to lip combo. Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water I can't tell you how many makeup artists and skincare experts have recommended Bioderma's Sensibio H2O Micellar Water to me. The classic French pharmacy product quickly and easily dissolves makeup, cleansing the skin without leaving behind even a hint of redness or irritation. Bondi Sands Self Tanning Foam Behold! The only self-tanner I've used consistently for over five years‚ÄîBondi Sands' Self Tanning Foam in Dark. It doesn't streak. It doesn't smell. It also features a bronze guide color, allowing you to see exactly where you're placing it and where you need to blend. I wear it overnight, and by the next morning, I have natural-looking, sun-kissed limbs. COLOR WOW Dream Coat Supernatural Spray I've always wondered how celebrities like Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian get such glossy hair on the red carpet. Well, as it turns out, the answer is Color Wow's Dream Coat Supernatural Spray. Read my full review to learn why it's such an underrated gem. COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence Snail mucin is the ultimate glass-skin ingredient. It's moisturizing, antioxidant-rich, and anti-inflammatory, so no wonder this iconic snail mucin essence blew up on the internet. It's the key to firm, bouncy, dewy skin. Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey Clinique's Almost Lipstick in Black Honey is so good. It was *the* lipstick for '90s starlets and supermodels. Everyone from Drew Barrymore to Courteney Cox and Julia Roberts wore it in the decade of slip dresses, grunge music, and mood rings. Cut to modern day, and it's still as beloved as ever. It recently had a resurgence on¬†TikTokafter¬†Gen Z¬†became aware of its sheer formula and unique and universally flattering raisin-esque color. divi Scalp Serum..."

I found dozens that I'd personally add to my cart as a shopping writer and Prime member myself. Amazon Prime Day, aka the biggest sale of the year so far, is officially here. Prime members have four days (yes, four) to shop exclusive discounts across categories, including tech, beauty, home and kitchen, plus take advantage of limited-time promotions like Lightning Deals. And while hundreds of deals are available to shop right now, they're not all worthwhile ‚Äî in fact, most aren't. As shopping editors, we get an advanced preview of the deals, so I spent the past few weeks combing through discounts to find the ones I think are actually worth adding to your cart. I've covered Prime Day for the past six years and in that time, I've perfected the deal hunting process. I look for items that are: 20% off or more, highly rated from hundreds of reviews and at its lowest price in at least three months. Every single deal I recommend below meets those qualifications, and I'll update this list live throughout Prime Day as more drop. Selected.Our top picks Out of all the teeth whitening strips we've tested, these are our favorite because they're easy to use and highly effective. Strips are coated in a layer of hydrogen peroxide to remove stains, and they're flexible, so they mold to the shape of your mouth. There's 44 strips in the box, which is enough for 22 treatments ‚Äî 20 are 45-minute standard treatments, and two are 60-minute express treatments. Lowest Price Ever Track workouts, daily activity, sleep, health metrics like heart rate and more with this smartwatch. It's water-resistant, so you can swim with it, and it connects to your phone, letting you answer calls and texts. The watch's battery lasts for about 18 hours when it's fully charged, and 30 minutes in the included charger gives you about 80% battery, according to Apple. It's always a good idea to have extra batteries at home, especially to put in your emergency kit and power kids toys, remotes and flashlights. This pack comes with 32 AA alkaline batteries, which last up to 10 years if they're unused, according to the brand. This corded vacuum can clean dirt, pet hair and other messes on all floors in your home. It has a detachable pod and long nozzle, letting you clean hard-to-reach areas like above door frames, on stairs and under furniture. The vacuum is built with a HEPA filter to trap allergens like dust and pollen, and it comes with crevice and upholstery tools. LifeStraw's personal filter can remove over 99% of bacteria, parasites and microplastics from water, making it ideal to bring with you while camping or hiking, or pack in an emergency kit. The tool can filter up to 1,000 gallons of water before you need to replace it. It has a cap to protect the part you sip from, and a layard so you can put it around your neck.

Amazon Prime Day is back, as usual offering a wealth of discounts across all major shopping areas. For the next four days, bargains can be nabbed on major brands, including Ninja. The name is not only known for its popular air fryers, but also kitchen accessories like pots and pans, blenders, ice cream makers and even water bottles, the latter now on sale. READ MORE: Our top Prime Day beauty picks including big brands like COSRX and Olaplex READ MORE: Our top Amazon Prime Day tech deals to help kickstart your shopping spree The Ninja Thirsti water bottle and flask boasts the ability to keep beverages hot, cold or even fizzy for extended periods due to its ""triple-vacuum insulation"". Available in six different colours, you can now snag the largest 709ml option for just ¬£21.99, a discount of 37 percent. Shoppers may want to act fast though, as the drinks holder was a quick sell out in Amazon's last sale. Alternatively, the slightly smaller 530ml version is available for ¬£19.99, a saving of 33 percent. It comes in different sizes(Image: Amazon/Ninja) This 'innovative' gadget, part of the ever-popular Ninja range, claims it can keep ice cubes intact for two days, maintain cold drinks for 24 hours and hot beverages for eight hours. Customers have been overwhelmingly impressed with the Ninja Thirsti, awarding it an average score of 4.6 out of 5, reports the Daily Star. Free Amazon Prime membership ¬£8.99 Free Amazon Get Prime here Try Amazon Prime for free One satisfied customer labelled it 'brilliant', writing: ""I use mine for all day walks and playing golf on a hot day. Highly recommended, far superior to any other drinks bottle I have used in the past. ""The other good thing is that the complete top part of the bottle unscrews making it easy to fill and clean."" Another dubbed it a 'must-have for summer', adding: ""Let's keep this short and sweet. You need this! It keeps cold drinks cold and warm drinks warm. It's light and easy to clean. Tech deal of the week It's that time of year where we are looking for ways to keep cool amidst the balmy, summer days. One item shoppers are raving over is this DDKJ Neck Fan that can be used to keep cool when commuting, at work or in the home. Even better, it costs just ¬£26.98 on Amazon. With certain parts of the UK set to reach sweltering 35C, it's handy that this neck fan comes with a rose gold cooling plate around the neck curve that is said to ""feel like an ice cube"", dropping temperatures to just 15C in as little as one second. The gadget comes with a cooling plate along the neck curve that ""feels like an ice cube""(Image: DDKJ) Boasting an ergonomic, wearable design, it features two bladeless fans that are safe to wear, with five different speed settings that provide a cooling effect on the head, neck and sides. It's also quite smart thanks to a LED digital display that makes the operation easy and convenient, while the built-in 5500mAh large capacity rechargeable battery features a fast charging chip that ensures a full charge within just 2.5-3hrs. Numerous shoppers who have bagged the neck fan say it is a ""godsend"" and a ""lifesaver"" for the heatwave, with one writing: ""This is easy to wear when sitting or walking generally. Works fast and never needed it on anything but the lowest setting! At my time of life it is a lifesaver, especially through the heatwave we experienced."" Keep cool amidst the rising temperatures with the DDKJ Neck Fan with Cooling Plate on Amazon for ¬£26.98 ""No leaks, no scratches, no weird taste. The only downside is the twist cap, which unlocks the bottle which makes it rather confusing at first but you can get used to it."" However, not all customers were swept away by the product. A dissatisfied customer left a 2-star review, stating: ""I regret buying the Ninja Thirsti Flask. For the price, I expected much better performance, but it falls short in two key areas: it doesn't keep water fizzy long enough, and it doesn't stay cold for nearly as long as my cheaper flask did. I have had a much more affordable flask that did a far better job at insulation and carbonation retention. ""At this point, I'll only be using the Ninja flask for emergencies, and I'm already looking to replace it with a better, more budget-friendly option...."

It has ceramides and niacinamide to hydrate skin, and layers well underneath makeup. A little also goes a long way with this moisturizer ‚Äî NBC Select reporter Zoe Malin says that since she doesn't need to use a lot at a time, the tube tends to last a while. Malin uses the curly-hair version of this anti-frizz spray daily, and says it smooths out her curls while locking in definition.

Now, as someone who was every shade of blonde at one stage, including platinum, I tended to rely on the iconic Olaplex brand to help keep my hair looking healthy, shiny and less frizzy at the ends. However, last year I decided to branch out with the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment that had attracted numerous TikTok videos and glowing reviews from shoppers who billed it as a ""miracle worker.""

To sweeten the deal even further, not only did I find this conditioner to be a ""lifesaver"" for damaged hair, but it's currently on offer for 32 percent less in the Amazon Prime Day sale, reduced from ¬£26.40 to just ¬£17.99 - and I am tempted to stock up for that price. For the beauty fans who are keen to take advantage of the Amazon deal, but aren't sure if the Bonding Treatment is right for them, I have provided below my full thoughts on when I first trialled it last year. ""Despite what you might think, I didn't run into this review with high expectations. I have used Olaplex in the past, which has helped the condition of my hair, but other products on the market don't tend to work well. Trust me, I have tried a lot. ""So, when I brought the Redken Leave-In Treatment on Amazon Prime Day, alongside the Pre-Shampoo Treatment, I decided to try and keep a level head. There's nothing worse than being disappointed, am I right? ""That being said, when I first popped this treatment on my damp ends, my first thought was that it seemed quite heavy, and I worried it would make my hair greasy. I couldn't have been more wrong, because like many reviews mentioned, a little goes a long way. ""I only needed just larger than a pea size amount to coat my lengths and ends evenly, and it melted in without weighing my fine hair down, unlike many other leave-in conditioners."" ""Considering many reviews and videos on TikTok say this treatment left their hair ""visibly healthier"" immediately, I was genuinely surprised to find myself agreeing with them. ""The first time I used the leave-in treatment, I used it alongside the pre-shampoo treatment and my hair felt smoother, with less tangles for my comb to snarl through. As soon as I blow dried my hair with the treatment in, I could notice that the broken, damaged ends of my hair were visibly smoother and a little shinier as well. ""Long gone were the gnarled looking straggly ends, and in their place was smooth, shiny hair that looked as though it had never been touched by any damage. Honestly, as someone who struggles with her fine hair, I was immediately surprised at the magic. ""After using the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment during my hair wash days in the week, I noticed that my hair doesn't look as damaged. ""Even though I've used it a few times now, the bottle still feels full, which is insane value for money. Considering my thin hair can go through products like crazy due to its weaker nature, I think that this treatment will be a staple that will save me cash in the long run. ""It's not just saving me money, as my hair genuinely feels softer and less fragile since I began using it. While it's no replacement for a good salon visit to cut off the dead ends, it's certainly a miracle worker in between appointments that has helped save my over processed hair to look, leaving it in much better condition."" Purchase my new go-to hair hero the Redken Acidic Bonding Concentrate Leave-In Treatment for 32 percent less in the Amazon Prime Day event now. For a few alternatives worth trying out, I would still personally recommend the Olaplex No.6 Bond Smoother that is also on offer on Amazon for ¬£19.80, down from ¬£28. Over at Boots, one shoppers also say is a good option is the L'Or√©al Paris Elvive Bond Repair Leave-In Serum that costs ¬£16.99."

So, when it comes to spotting a good deal, I like to think I have an eye for picking out the best options. This year's event kicked off at 00.01 today and will run until 23.59 on Friday 11 July. This sale is a little different to previous iterations of the popular shopping event, as it's the first time that the sale has run for more than 48 hours. This time around Amazon Prime Day will run for four days, with new deals (and price changes) popping up throughout the period. The sale is great for picking up all of your favourite brands at heavily discounted prices, but it's important to remember that deals don't always last for long, so acting quickly will help to avoid missing out on the best prices. Below, I've rounded up all my tried and tested shopping advice for landing the best deals and ensuring you're actually getting a good discount, as well as curating a list of all my top picks to buy during this year's sale event.

It's easy to assume that all deals shared during discounted shopping events offer good value, but as I've learnt from years of working as a shopping writer, that isn't always the case. To make sure you're getting a good deal, I'd recommend checking the price of sale items - you can do this using the free online price tracker CamelCamelCamel . To use the site, all you need to do is paste the link of the product you're interested in buying into the search bar and you'll be able to see its price history, including when it was last discounted - this will tell you whether a deal is actually offering a worthwhile saving. It's also important to check the prices that other retailers are offering for an item before buying it. Here's how to make sure you don't miss out on the best discounts If you've got your eye on a specific product or number of products, it's a good idea to make an Amazon wish list, so that you can shop directly from the list during the sale. Or, if you're worried about missing out on a deal, I'd recommend using the Amazon deals alert feature. This allows shoppers to get notifications for any items that have recently been searched or viewed on the website and in the app - to create a deal alert, all you need to do is head to the Amazon Prime Day event page to create deal alerts and set up push notifications for during the event. Other places to shop It's not just Amazon that's running a sale this week, a number of other UK retailers have also heavily discounted their products. If you're looking for a place to shop outside of Amazon Prime, these are all the other places offering reduced prices: Boots - Up to 50% off New Look - Up to 70% off Dunelm - Clearance sale Boden - Up to 60% off Very - Up to 30% off"

That's where we come in. We decided to have a little fun and showcase what our carts would look like if we had a budget of $500 to work with during Prime Day. As you can see below, the possibilities are endless. Spoiler alert: bulk candy is on the list. Check out what happened below when our team went window shopping during Prime Day. Francisco Here's what I'm adding to cart during Prime Day TheraGun Mini (3rd-Generation) - $187 Why: I'm training to run a marathon this year, and so having a massage gun has become paramount for pain relief and recovery. Not only that, but the TheraGun Mini is ultra-portable and TSA compliant, meaning I can bring it with me when I do some travel later this summer and run on the road. A note: The Therabody massage guns are HSA/FSA approved, so if you have an HSA account, you can use those funds towards this. Apple AirPods Pro 2 wireless earbuds - $160 Why: It's time for an upgrade from my current pair of AirPods, and these are currently seeing their lowest price of the year. While it's still not at its lowest price ever (that was back on Black Friday 2024), the deal is good enough and fits in my budget. Plus, my original AirPods are an older model, so I'm excited for a newer model. A note: If you add AppleCare+, it will be an extra $29 to your order. Bissell Crosswave Turbo wet dry vacuum - $130 Why: A cordless stick vacuum is pretty pricey, and I do still need a mop to pick up any messes and spills on my floors. This wet dry vacuum covers everything I need in one device, for a fraction of the cost of a Dyson cordless vacuum. Arm & Hammer Power Sheets box - $10 Why: Tackle up to 100 loads for $10? Need I say more? I'll say one more thing. Much easier to store away than a large bottle of liquid detergent, and takes away the worry of detergent spills too. Affresh washing machine cleaner - $10 Why: A six-month supply of tablets to clean my washing machine and keep it running properly. Parting with an Alexander Hamilton is a good trade, I think. Related video above: Top July Sales at Target, Walmart, and Amazon: Save Big This Summer Xin Xin Here's what I'm buying on Amazon Prime Day: Shark AI Ultra Voice Control Robot Vacuum - $297.99 Why: Who would have thought a miniature pinscher and a basset hound could shed this much? It seems like a never-ending, daily task to clean up dog hair everywhere on the floor. So this year, I've decided to cave in and get a robot vacuum. I am especially excited that the robot vacuum will get to hard-to-reach places, such as under the bed. Olaplex No. 7 Bonding Oil - $21 Why: I've been using Olaplex's No. 3 pre-wash hair conditioner for years, ever since I started bleaching my hair. It's done a great job at keeping it healthy even after the harsh bleaching treatments. So I've always wanted to try the No. 7 bonding oil as well. This is a great time to try a new product as I can save 30% as part of Amazon's Prime Day deals. COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence - $15.99 Why: With over 88,000 reviews and a 4.5-star rating, this internet viral skincare product promises to reduce dullness and soothe dehydrated skin. You can't beat the price of $15.99 either to try a star product. LANEIGE Lip Sleeping Mask - $16.80 Why: This is a product I swear by - I've been using it nightly for years. It truly helps lock in moisture on your lips overnight and keeps your lips from being dry and chapped during the day. PETLIBRO Dog Water Fountain - $42.49 Why: It's time to spoil my pups. Right now, Daisy the basset hound and Gaga the miniature pinscher drink water from a water bowl, but I often find dirt and fur in the water...."

That's where we come in. We decided to have a little fun and showcase what our carts would look like if we had a budget of $500 to work with during Prime Day. As you can see below, the possibilities are endless. Spoiler alert: bulk candy is on the list. Check out what happened below when our team went window shopping during Prime Day. Francisco Here's what I'm adding to cart during Prime Day TheraGun Mini (3rd-Generation) - $187Why: I'm training to run a marathon this year, and so having a massage gun has become paramount for pain relief and recovery. Not only that, but the TheraGun Mini is ultra-portable and TSA compliant, meaning I can bring it with me when I do some travel later this summer and run on the road. A note: The Therabody massage guns are HSA/FSA approved, so if you have an HSA account, you can use those funds towards this. - $160Why: It's time for an upgrade from my current pair of AirPods, and these are currently seeing their lowest price of the year. While it's still not at its lowest price ever (that was back on Black Friday 2024), the deal is good enough and fits in my budget. Plus, my original AirPods are an older model, so I'm excited for a newer model. A note: If you add AppleCare+, it will be an extra $29 to your order. - $130Why: A cordless stick vacuum is pretty pricey, and I do still need a mop to pick up any messes and spills on my floors. This wet dry vacuum covers everything I need in one device, for a fraction of the cost of a Dyson cordless vacuum. - $10Why: Tackle up to 100 loads for $10? Need I say more? I'll say one more thing. Much easier to store away than a large bottle of liquid detergent, and takes away the worry of detergent spills too. - $10 Why: A six-month supply of tablets to clean my washing machine and keep it running properly. Parting with an Alexander Hamilton is a good trade, I think. Top July Sales at Target, Walmart, and Amazon: Save Big This Summer Xin Xin Here's what I'm buying on Amazon Prime Day: - $297.99Why: Who would have thought a miniature pinscher and a basset hound could shed this much? It seems like a never-ending, daily task to clean up dog hair everywhere on the floor. So this year, I've decided to cave in and get a robot vacuum. I am especially excited that the robot vacuum will get to hard-to-reach places, such as under the bed.

Right now, Daisy the basset hound and Gaga the miniature pinscher drink water from a water bowl, but I often find dirt and fur in the water. This dog water fountain, now 46% off its original price, helps pull fur and crumbs into its filtration system.Its anti-splash design prevents your pups from spilling the water. It's suitable for medium to large dogs. - $23.79Why: I'd argue that a one-piece tennis dress is one of the most popular outfits this summer. It's so convenient and comfortable, and no, you do not just wear it to tennis! I came across so many of these while attending various events such as the night markets here in Oklahoma City - definitely a statement piece for the summer. And it pairs well with sneakers or sandals. So versatile! This unique open-back design comes in 18 different colors...."

Whether I need to restock my combination skincare routine or am looking to test a buzzy new beauty device, a great deal is always around the corner. Looks like it's true that good things come to those who wait‚ÄîAmazon Prime Day is here just in time to refresh my summer beauty routine. From now through July 11, you can spot hundreds (if not thousands) of deals on Amazon in every major category, including summer shoes and vacation essentials. However, it's the sale of the year for beauty fans as top brands like Supergoop, Sol de Janeiro, Shark Beauty, Laneige, and so many more are at a major discount. To put it simply, Amazon Prime Day is not a sale you want to skip. To ensure you don't miss out on any of the incredible discounts, I'm bringing you the ultimate edit of Amazon Prime Day's best beauty deals.

The Best Overall Beauty Deals at Amazon Prime Day Amazon Prime Day at a Glance Best Skincare Deals at Amazon Prime Day Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Spf 50 (Was $38) While technically this is a facial sunscreen, it doubles as a makeup primer that can be used anytime, anywhere. Katherine J. Igoe, an MC contributing editor, says, ""It goes on smoothly and feels incredibly lightweight without any of the annoyances of most sunscreens."" Katherine J. Igoe tests Supergoop! Unseen Sunscren SPF 50. (Image credit: MC Editors) Bioderma Bioderma Sensibio H2o Micellar Water (Was $14) Waterproof mascara, SPF, makeup, and dirt don't stand a chance with this French pharmacy favorite in your routine. A couple of drops on a cotton pad will remove your makeup, all while balancing pH, hydrating, and soothing skin. CeraVe Cerave Hydrating Cream to Foam Cleanser (Was $20) This cleanser is just what your skincare routine needs as a first step‚Äîit gently removes makeup and grime without drying out your skin.

Embryolisse Embryolisse Lait-Cr√®me Concentr√© (Was $29) Another French beauty staple, this moisturizer will have your skin feeling baby soft and smooth in no time. It's a rich cream that deeply nourishes the skin, without feeling too heavy or leaving behind any greasiness. Kiehl's Avocado Eye Treatment (Was $38) This is one of the best eye creams for dryness, so it's not a bad idea to stock up before the fall. It uses avocado oil and caffeine to help smooth puffy eyes and fine lines and to boost radiance.

mov_EB49A73F402A85E592FEE96F896962DE,2025-07-08 14:38:45,en,WEB,"‚Äâ If you regularly dye, blow dry, straighten, or curl your hair, chances are that your locks are slightly (or maybe more than slightly) damaged. These common hair practices can all lead to weak strands, breakage, frizz, split ends, and more, and once the damage is done, it can be hard to fix. However, all hope isn't lost quite yet: It possible to repair damaged hair, making it look vibrant and healthy again, if you have the right products. One of the top-recommended hair repair treatments is Olaplex No. 3 Hair Perfector, a pre-wash treatment that you leave in for several minutes before showering. This hair product has legions of fans, and it's currently available at its lowest price of the year. If you're struggling with dried, fried, or otherwise damaged hair, this is one Amazon Prime Day deal you won't want to miss. The cult-favorite Olaplex No. 3 is currently 30% off, bringing its price down to just $21. Thousands of reviewers ‚Äî myself included ‚Äî swear that this formula is the key to reviving damaged hair, and if you've been wanting to try it out for yourself, there's no better time to grab a bottle (or two!) . Olaplex No. 3 is clinically proven to help reverse hair damage after just a single use, helping to improve your hair's strength, texture, and appearance. $21 at Amazon Why is this a good deal? Olaplex products work phenomenally, but they are definitely a splurge. The No. 3 formula typically retails for $30 for a 3.3-ounce bottle, and it rarely goes on sale. For Prime Day, this beloved hair repair treatment is marked down 30%, bringing its price to just $21 ‚Äî the lowest we've seen all year. Why do I need this? If your hair is looking dull or frizzy due to damage, Olaplex No. 3 is arguably the best way to restore it. The product is designed to be put in damp hair, and you let it soak in for up to 10 minutes before rinsing it out. (Many people choose to apply it before their shower, then wash their hair as usual.) In just a few minutes, the formula is able to strengthen your hair ‚Äî the brand explains that it repairs damage on a molecular level by rebuilding the disulfide bonds that give hair its strength. This will make your hair look smoother and less textured, and it should also be easier to detangle after washing. The product also helps to prevent future breakage, and you'll start seeing results after the very first use. No. 3 can be used on all types of hair, and it only needs to be applied once a week. What reviewers say Olaplex No. 3 has been clinically tested, but it also has thousands of avid fans who swear by the formula. In fact, Amazon says that more than 100,000 shoppers have purchased the hair treatment multiple times ‚Äî so you know it works! ‚úÖ Pros If you're skeptical about how well Olaplex No. 3 works, the glowing reviews will definitely put your worries to rest: ‚ÄúMy hair? Fried. Frizzed. Emotionally unstable. It had seen things ‚Äî bleach, box dye, questionable heat styling decisions ‚Äî and it was holding a grudge,‚Äù writes one ecstatic reviewer. ‚ÄúEnter this little miracle worker. Olaplex No. 3 is worth the hype! It's a bond-builder, which sounds like something from a superhero movie, and honestly, that's the energy it brings. This is the closest thing to an apology your strands will ever get from you.‚Äù Older reviewers also love the formula, saying it makes their hair look much younger and healthier: ‚ÄúIt is the fountain of youth for your hair,‚Äù explains a self-described skeptic. ‚ÄúMine now looks and feels as good as it did over 20 years ago. Thick. Shiny. Soft. Bouncy. Gorgeous.‚Äù Many reviewers also say this product comes recommended by their hairdressers: ‚ÄúMy hair is overly dry, brittle, and unable to manage because of the damage from highlighting,‚Äù says another repeat buyer. ‚ÄúI was absolutely hating my hair, to tears. My hairdresser suggested that I try this. It has made all the difference. My hair is shiny, feels healthier, and I have confidence again.‚Äù ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons One of the biggest downsides of this product is that it comes in a small 3.3-ounce bottle, and you may go through it quickly if you have long or thick hair: ‚ÄúThis worked well when using it with Olaplex No. 4 and 5, but the bottle is so small, I only got four uses out of it,‚Äù says another reviewer...."

mov_2848D6BD334EC3C7FD64AE1E8F895C6D,2025-07-08 16:13:40,en,WEB,"‚Äâ As a middle-aged lady who tests beauty products for a living, I get especially excited by ‚Äî it's a time when I can scoop up essential makeup, hair and skin care for a fraction of what I'd normally pay, often at the lowest prices I'll see all year. My Prime Day strategy is simple: Stock up on reliably good devices, lotions and potions that keep my 52-year-old face looking as youthful as possible, my hair full and bouncy, and my skin soft and smooth. As you scroll through Amazon's giant sale event, you'll find thousands of deeply discounted name-brand (and very much NOT name-brand) beauty products. The deals are overwhelming, so here's how I've narrowed things down: I'm looking for well-reviewed devices and formulations I trust and have tested myself. The only beauty items I'll place in my Prime Day cart will be steeply discounted, made with high-quality ingredients I recognize and come with a proven track record of results. The Prime Day beauty deals below represent some of my all-time favorite products. They're the kind of beauty-insider scores I recommend often and hope others love too. The best Prime Day beauty deals Amazon Our pick for , Neutrogena's sheer, high-coverage chemical SPF is dermatologist-recommended, affordable, reliable and beloved by not only normies like us, but celebs like Nicole Kidman. She told in 2019: ""I'm shooting outdoors a lot, so the most important thing is the sunscreen ‚Äî I use Neutrogena. ... I reapply every 90 minutes, every single day."" This nongreasy formula is ideal for anyone who detests the oily, sticky feel of many sunscreens. It also dries quickly, making it a good choice for layering under makeup. $6 at Amazon Amazon If you're new to the retinol game or have dry skin, CeraVe's formula is an excellent place to start ‚Äî in fact, it's our . It contains just a .3% concentration, which means it will be gentler and less drying than higher-potency products. It's also filled with skin-calming agents like niacinamide and moisturizing hyaluronic acid. Best of all, right now it's a full 30% off, making it inexpensive enough to try without the guilt of a major skin-care investment. $17 at Amazon Amazon Martha Stewart loves facials. In fact, according to her website, she's been getting the same one at the same place ‚Äî the ‚Äî for 40 years. So it should come as little surprise that almost all of her favorite skin care products are from the high-quality Mario Badescu line. Martha's top picks include this mega-popular collagen mask, which is specially formulated to work for both mature and sensitive skin. The award-winning product is made from collagen and kaolin clay and is meant to tighten, firm and bring moisture to parched faces, necks and even decollet√©. Save $7 Lowest price ever $13 at Amazon Amazon If you're feeling self-conscious about stubble (or just hate to wax and shave) this at-home laser-hair-removal device just might be for you and now's the time to pick it up: For Prime Day, it's marked down a whopping 70%: from $200 to just $60. ""This gadget brought my confidence back,"" shared one. ""I've been using this product for five weeks now, and I cannot believe the amazing results. After having my five children, I experienced hair growth on my chin, and when I pluck them, they will leave dark spots and marks ... I started using this product and within a month, the hair growth stopped. I wish I'd found this product years ago. It is easy to use and it is very convenient."" $54 at Amazon Amazon Crest Whitestrips rarely drop in price unless there's a big sales event, so even a slight savings is worth it ‚Äî and 35% off is certainly something to smile at. Pearly whites, here you come. ""They actually work, y'all!"" exclaimed . ""I can hardly believe my own eyes! I'm sold! I just saved $250 for professional teeth bleaching."" $30 at Amazon Amazon After testing dozens of mascaras earlier this year, I named Maybelline's Lash Sensational , and it's nearly 40% off for Prime Day. The no-smudge, zero-flake formula lengthens and thickens lashes without being a hassle to apply (I did not have to remove globs from the applicator brush once in the last month ‚Äî a first)...."

1luwwbq,2025-07-08 18:51:38,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ I've posted on this sub before. Basically my ex bf used my car for a few weeks and I found an olaplex hair oil in the backseat. He said he had no idea where it came from and even suggested my mom or sister may have left it there, knowing fully they hadn't been in the car in weeks. Anyway, long story short, I broke up with him and that was a huge reason why. Weeks have passed and i had a hunch to make a fake dating profile and found him on it. He actually matched with me and even reached out. (I didn't use my own pics and he doesn't know it was me. But it makes me feel so disgusted to know he would've talked to the girl and possibly seen and such) I'm really confused and not sure how to digest that info. The past five weeks have been a nightmare for me and no matter how much I try, it feels like I will never be able to move on. Not to mention that at this point i'm bargaining with myself to not go back to him. I feel shocked that he's on a dating app - how could he do that if he said he truly loved me and he had an engagement ring? He didn't get to propose but even his mom told me she was confused about our breakup because he had a ring and was ready to propose. How can someone have a ring and be ready to propose and yet sign up for a dating app five measly weeks later? We dated for YEARS. 2 years consistently, then 2 years on and off, then another 2 years SERIOUSLY committed. Spent every single day together for the past 2 years. Imm so confused and it doesn't make sense to me. Im well aware some of these takes wouldn't come from a mature person, so please be kind lol. I'm sorry for venting, I just don't want to tell anybody from my family because I don't want to be judged. Also - this may be dumb - but could I assume that since he went on dating apps so quickly, then he definitely cheated and the hair oil is proof of it? I just don't know what else to think of it, and to be frank, i'm not sure why i obsess over it so much. I know it's done anyway but it's like my heart doesn't want to accept it. I don't want him back but I don't want to accept the idea that we'll never be together again."

I usually use 6 which is a thick heavy cream, but this one seems like a light hair milk kind of texture, probably good for fine hair. I wish amazon UK had those brands, but BK, Milk and Sigma are not on ours. There do seem to be a few UD and IT cosmetics stuff but just old stuff, not the new releases"

Whether it's investigating the financials of Elon Musk's pro-Trump PAC or producing our latest documentary, 'The A Word', which shines a light on the American women fighting for reproductive rights, we know how important it is to parse out the facts from the messaging. At such a critical moment in US history, we need reporters on the ground. Your donation allows us to keep sending journalists to speak to both sides of the story. The Independent is trusted by Americans across the entire political spectrum. And unlike many other quality news outlets, we choose not to lock Americans out of our reporting and analysis with paywalls. We believe quality journalism should be available to everyone, paid for by those who can afford it. Amazon Prime Day is underway. And, as a shopping editor who has covered the retailer's sales for more than five years, it's safe to say I know how to spot a good deal from a dud. I'd always recommend using price comparison tools to make sure you're getting the best possible price, but I can confidently say some of the best deals see big-ticket products plummet to their lowest-ever price. Apple's AirPods Pro 2, for example, have been reduced by $100 to just $149, making them cheaper than their Black Friday price. And both Dyson's top-rated air purifier and Yeti's tumbler are now cheaper than ever. There are also impressive savings on Ninja air fryers, robot vacuums, CeraVe beauty products, and gaming devices. For the first ever year, the summer sale is running for four full days, but when will it end? Keep scrolling for answers to all of your burning questions, as well as a handpicked selection of the best deals across tech, appliances, beauty, and more. When did Amazon Prime Day 2024 start in the US? Amazon kicked off its Prime Day sale on July 8 at midnight. For the first year, the Amazon Prime Day sale will run for four days. Amazon Prime Day ends on July 11. From experience, the deals tend to stay the same for the duration of the event. But big-ticket items such as AirPods or games consoles do have a tendency to sell out before the end of the sales event. Is Prime Day only for Prime members? Yes, Prime Day is a celebration of Amazon's Prime members, so you'll actually need to be a Prime member to secure all the deals. Amazon Prime costs $14.99 per month or $139 per year. But there is a way around paying for the subscription. If you're not already a Prime member, you might be eligible for a free 30-day trial of Prime. It's only available to Amazon customers who have never been a Prime member before or haven't been a Prime member in the last 12 months. If you're between the ages of 18 and 22, you can also get an even longer six-month free trial, as well as half-price memberships, meaning you'll pay just $7.49 instead of $14.99 per month.

I have long hair and use one to cut down on breakage and my hair is so much less tangled in the morning,. It's actually pretty surprising. Most of the ones on Amazon are xl, but I managed to find one that was smaller. Also, my hairdresser told me to be sure not to use heavy duty bond repair products, like Olaplex 3, more than every 7 shampoos because it can really mess up your hair."

mov_EED50947EA0D980ED01CFC7CEFFB2501,2025-07-09 06:00:00,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Your foolproof guide to Amazon beauty Beauty is big business for Amazon. For many shoppers, it's one of the first places they look when they want to score a bargain or speedy delivery, and there's almost no product you can't find on the site. However, there are an increasing number of fake beauty products up for grabs, and they're easily mistaken for the real thing if you don't know which signs to look out for. A 2023 study by the UK government found that 8% of those sampled who purchased beauty and hygiene products in the last year purchased counterfeit goods, whilst a 2018 study in the US discovered that over 42% of items bought from third-party sellers on websites such as Amazon were fake. With products like SPF moisturisers and retinol serums in particular, using something that differs from what it says on the label can be extremely risky, especially for those with sensitive or problematic skin. Moreover, no one wants to be spending money on something that has been falsely advertised. However, once you know how to differentiate the real deal from the fakes, it's very easy to ensure each and every Amazon purchase you make is authentic. As a Shopping Editor who spends a lot of time browsing beauty online, I've become very familiar with what the listings for legitimate products look like. And with Prime Day now in full swing, there's no time like the present to ensure anything you buy is exactly what you're hoping for. How to spot a legitimate Amazon retailer Since Amazon is a marketplace open to third-party sellers, it can be tricky to regulate. This means that there are countless illegitimate listings, ranging from convincing dupes to false product pages. Although many brands try their best to prevent this from happening, there are always some items that slip through the cracks. If you do a lot of shopping on Amazon, particularly for beauty, you can't assume that every branded product is the real thing. This is my foolproof guide to shopping legitimate beauty products on Amazon, and the things you should avoid. 1. Check the storefront My first tip is by far the most important‚Äîfollow this step and you're almost certainly going to be purchasing a legitimate product. Every brand with genuine items on Amazon will have a storefront, which is a landing page dedicated to the brand where you can shop all of its products. When on a product page, you will see a link right underneath the product name that says 'Visit the [brand name] store', or the brand's logo above the product name which is hyperlinked. Click on one of those, and it should take you through to the brand hub. If there is no link or dedicated brand page, it's most likely that the product you're viewing is from a reseller and is not legitimate. Any established brand will have a storefront, so if you can't find it, it's best to avoid the product and shop through a different site. 2. Check the brand's verified sellers Another way to ensure you're not getting duped is by verifying that the brand you're shopping does sell products on Amazon. The best way is to go directly to the brand's website and find its 'where to buy' section. Every brand that sells on other websites should have one, and if you see Amazon listed there, you're good to go. If there is no mention of products on Amazon anywhere on the website, again, it's worth shopping elsewhere. 3. Shop via the Amazon navigation bar Rather than searching by product and clicking on the first one that comes up, you can use the Amazon navigation bar to get you to the right place. Select 'Health & Beauty' from the sidebar and go from there, or go via the Amazon beauty hub which will take you directly to the big brand storefronts. These are all brands that are verified by Amazon and have gone through the necessary checks to ensure they're authentic. 4. Assess the imagery, description and packaging If the imagery on the product page is very blurry, there's only one picture, or something about the item looks slightly off, that's another telltale sign that it's been listed by a third party reseller. All genuine product pages from authorised brands will have plenty of high quality images, lots of detail in the description, and additional details listed below it. Take a close look at the photos and be sure that it looks exactly how it should and nothing is out of place. If you're purchasing a product you've previously owned, you're probably familiar with what the item should look like. Otherwise, it's worth looking at pictures from other sites to compare. 5. Make sure it isn't too good to be true You can find some brilliant deals on Amazon, particularly when Prime Day rolls around, but it's worth being wary of offers that seem too good to be true. This is especially important with high end or luxury products. If it's outrageously reduced, far beyond any offer you've seen before elsewhere, it probably isn't the real thing. 6. Check reviews It's an obvious one, but you should always check reviews to see what other customers are saying...."

n25lmq3,2025-07-09 11:17:01,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ ‚ÄúLike steel wool‚Äù? Say goodbye to that Nexxus and transition into something like Redken's All Soft line. And I know it's unfair and I hate it too but don't even bother with the conditioner that matches the shampoo. Buy the tube(s) of All Soft Heavy Cream and use as your conditioner. Wash hair first in the shower then comb your conditioner through and clip it up. Leave it on until you're ready to get out then rinse. And it doesn't need to be squeaky clean rinsed out. Apply a leave in (like It's a 10, or Redken or if you're looking to save check out Marc Anthony products on Amazon) to wet hair and comb it through. You can do it flipped upside down in the shower if you want to start scrunching and see if you can get some curls going. Get a hair oil. Plenty of good ones around nearly every price point. Olaplex is nearly weightless, I prefer something heavier. Trader Joe's has a coconut oil serum that's @6 bucks. Also, L'Or√©al (who is owned by the same company as their luxury cousin, Kerastase) is at your local store and makes some nice products. I'm sorry, I'm in a hurry- not trying to be rude short or bossy! Please let me know if any of this sounds good or if you'd rather go with a different goal like Paul Mitchell's The Skinny Serum? I'm happy to help! And want to, just needed to get this here so hopefully I'll be back. Hope  you have a wonderful day! (If you're off and staying in, warm up whatever- within reason- oil you have and run it through from mid shaft to ends. Or just put your deep conditioner on and top it with a shower cap. If you want to, of course. Again, so sorry for the rushed delivery!)"

Note: To get these deals you have to be a Prime member, so if you aren't already, sign up for a free 30 day trial here. 1. 40% off (that's $100 off, an all-new lowest price ever!) the 2nd Gen AirPods Pro. With active noise cancellation, spatial audio, three silicone tips for customized fit, and over 24 hours of listening time with the included case, the AirPods Pro 2 give you a *ton* of bang for your buck. Promising review:¬†""Nothing compares. The noise canceling is superior. I fly a lot on the airlines and I don't have to hear screaming babies anymore. I hit the noise canceling and watch my movie or listen to my music. These are the best earphones I've ever had."" ‚ÄîPatrice Price:¬†$149¬†(originally $249 (and currently $249 at Apple); typically $189.99 at Amazon) ‚Äî and shop all the Apple deals here AirPods 4 are also a new lowest price ever ‚Äî 34% off with noise cancellation (down to $119), 31% off without (down to $89). 2. 60% off (the lowest price ever!) the TikTok-viral TirTir cushion foundation that offers 72 hours of flawless wear, blending seamlessly to hide redness, blemishes, and under-eye bags. It has buildable coverage, perfect for a natural look or full glam. Plus, it's packed with hibiscus and red propolis extracts for a boost in skin elasticity. And to top it all off, its oval-shaped puff can reach every little corner of your face. Check out this TikTok of Mikayla Nogueira's review of this foundation. Promising review: ""OMG! I cannot believe how amazing this foundation is! Please do not listen to the bad comments, run and buy it and test it yourself! I honestly did not order this sooner because of the bad reviews, but decided to give it a try. I have tried from the most expensive foundations and nothing compares to this one! I had people stop me and ask me what I was wearing. I love the fact that it's all in one simple compact and easy to travel with. I no longer need a brush nor a Beautyblender. Also, this foundation does not need primer or setting spray! All you need is to apply powder to set the foundation. My skin looks flawless, like I have no makeup, full coverage but not cakey, it's super thin like water and covers every little spot. I feel I have a filter. My face looks amazing and I will forever wear this, I hope they never discontinue this."" ‚ÄîAnonymous Price: $10 (originally $25, typically $19.99-$25 on Amazon; available in 40 shades and a mini size) ‚Äî and shop all the TirTir deals here 3. 30% off Olaplex's No. 7 hair-bonding oil that'll provide heat protection (up to 450 degrees) and softness, help reduce frizz, and impart maaaajor shine ‚Äî without your hair feeling weighed down or greasy. And all with just 2-3 drops! That means you save today *and* this bottle'll last you a long time. Promising review: ""This hair oil is a total game-changer! My hair feels softer, shinier, and healthier after just a few uses. It smells amazing and doesn't feel greasy at all. I've tried so many oils, but this one is by far the best I've ever had...."

Cream of nature argan oil shampoo. Red bottle. Works SO good Olive oil creamy aloe shampoo. Very good one and low priced. This is a clarifying shampoo that cleans build up on your scalp. Use once a month, but it works very well Olaplex #3. Runs about 30$ but a little goes a long way. That is your bond builder. Restores ANY damage done by chemicals to your hair. Mix about a quarter size in with your conditioner during wash days and you will see the difference. Conditioners Olive oil replenishing conditioner with sweet orange oil is great. Good price also. A good hair mayonnaise is perfect, too. ORS brand is good. Good price also."
mov_3F002AECF3E70C76C9A4DF0AAAABDDD8,2025-07-09 17:16:13,en,WEB,"‚Äâ Amazon Prime Day is a four-day extravaganza this year, and it kicked off with a bang yesterday. Amazon slashed prices across all its departments, and we found all-time low prices on many popular products, ranging from bestselling tech to luxury haircare. We weren't the only ones impressed by this year's deals, either ‚Äî AOL readers did some savvy shopping yesterday, snatching up the best sales as soon as they dropped. Curious about what fellow shoppers are adding to their carts? Perhaps unsurprisingly, people purchased Apple AirPods by the dozen ‚Äî these top-rated earbuds only go on sale a few times a year, and for Prime Day, they're at their lowest price ! So, it's really a deal you won't want to miss. Other items that flew off the shelves include my personal favorite handheld vacuum, for less than $60 for Prime Day, as well as a reader-favorite electric spin scrubber, $8 bath mat, and these budget-friendly solar lights for your backyard. Quick OverviewSee 20 more Here's the good news: All of these top-selling items are still marked down for Day 2 of Amazon's summer savings event, and we're guessing that they'll be available all week long, assuming they don't sell out. Most of these deals are Prime exclusives, which means you do need an Amazon Prime account to access the sale price. However, you can easily sign up for a 30-day free Prime trial, which will allow you to shop all the best discounts. If you're ready to start shopping, the following are the most popular items that AOL readers bought on Prime Day yesterday. We always recommend waiting until Prime Day if you're in the market for AirPods, and we expected them to be marked down to around $160 for the sale. So imagine our surprise when Apple dropped the price of these popular earbuds to just $140! At 40% off, this is the lowest price we've ever seen for these fan-favorite noise-cancelling headphones, and many of our readers are taking advantage of the steep discount. Save $100¬†$149 at Amazon BLACK+DECKER I'm a huge fan of this handheld vacuum ‚Äî I've tested many in my career, and this one is tops in terms of both performance and value. At just $59, it's an absolute steal, and I'm happy to see that AOL readers agree with my assessment. $59 at Amazon Once again, Apple is offering higher-than-normal discounts for Prime Day. If you spot AirTags under $80, you've found a great deal, and for Prime Day, this four-pack of the little trackers is actually under $70. AirTags are ideal for attaching to your keys, wallet, suitcase, or even pet, as they allow you to quickly track down lost items from your phone, and this is an unbeatable price for a set of the handy gadgets. $65 at Amazon Our readers buy these electric scrubbers in droves every time they're on sale, so we're not surprised that their Prime Day price has attracted lots of shoppers. The tool's battery-powered brushhead makes cleaning the shower and tub a breeze, and it will save your knees and back. It also comes with several attachments so you can clean virtually any surface in your home. $32 at Amazon No one wants to spend too much on a bath mat, but for just $8, this chenille mat is a great Prime Day buy for your bathroom. It's plush and absorbent underfoot, and its rubber backing helps prevent slipping. Our readers have been loving it, and we think you will, too. Save $7¬†with coupon$8 at Amazon We knew Crest Whitestrips would be on sale for Prime Day, but we didn't expect such a steep discount! These strips are one of the easiest and most effective options for whitening your teeth at home ‚Äî they use hydrogen peroxide to help remove mild to moderate stains, and they're gentle on your enamel while still delivering visible results. Save $22¬†with coupon$28 at Amazon This two-pack of solar lights was a sleeper hit among AOL readers, and they're the perfect inexpensive option for jazzing up your outdoor living space in time for summer. They have a 270-degree wide lighting angle and dozens of LED diodes for maximum brightness, and you can grab a two-pack for just $10 right now. $10 at Amazon While not the most exciting purchase, I'd argue that a good meat thermometer is an essential for every kitchen ‚Äî after all, you don't want to be serving your family over- or under-cooked meat! This instant-read thermometer is a popular pick among AOL shoppers this Prime Day, and you're sure to get plenty of use out of it for grilling season. $12 at Amazon Rubbermaid Here's another kitchen essential that our readers have been snatching up. The Rubbermaid Brilliance line of food storage containers is one of the best options out there, and virtually all the different sizes and styles are on sale for Prime Day. So if your cabinet is a mess of mismatched, stained, or cracked containers, now's the time to upgrade. $18 at Amazon If you have damaged hair or split ends, Olaplex No. 3 is a game-changer ‚Äî I've personally used it and promise that it works wonders. This beloved product actually helps to reverse hair damage, and it will leave your locks softer and stronger after just one use. Plus, at just $21, there's no better time to grab a bottle to try for yourself. $21 at Amazon..."

The actress, 46, who stars in Prime Video's new police procedural series Ballard, a spin-off of the hit show Bosch, and which premieres July 9, lives part time in her native Hawaii with her partner of five years and her three dogs. She shares her how she starts her day for PEOPLE's My Good Morning series. The number one thing that makes for a good morning is eight to nine hours of sleep. Anything less is a dip to the system. When I'm here in Hawaii. I wake up with the sun. I'm up at six. I like to make sure that my mornings are very Zen. There's nothing better in the morning than a cuddle to show how much you love your person. The first thing I think when I open my eyes is, 'Is my partner lonely?' Sometimes my partner [Curtis, 56, a retired hedge fund manager] snores. I don't want to sleep separately, but sometimes you can't handle the noise. In the morning, I go back to him and give him a hug and make him feel loved. Maggie Q and her partner, Curtis. Maggie Q I'm a barefoot person. I was born and raised in Hawaii. We're a shoeless culture. I read all these books on healing, all this woo-woo stuff. And one of the major themes is grounding and feeling the floor with your feet. Walking in the grass. Walking on the wood. After our cuddle, I liquid load. I'm heavy on the liquids in the morning so that my body has enough time, space, and peace to have the liquids go in, break up anything that needs to come out for the day, because it's very important. Your body has to eliminate! First I¬†do room temperature lemon water, then my juice. I'm a big nerd when it comes to nutrition and juicing. I used to do a basic green recipe with cucumbers and celery and kale and all the usual suspects. Now I'm starting to juice things like endive and escarole and cabbage. It's exciting to learn new stuff. I have these dorky pajamas that are pinstriped, they are by Eberjey and have my initials on the pocket, like I'm British royalty. Mine say MQ, and it just makes me feel like I'm important. Eberjey PJs. Eberjey I'm not addicted to coffee but I love the taste of it. I usually have coffee later after I exercise as an, ""I earned this."" I don't need it to wake me up. I make my partner whatever he needs when I do my juice. He likes two-minute eggs. And I get his vitamins ready and his Voli energy drink. [Maggie Q is an investor with Voli.] It's green tea and completely natural. We set up our day with quiet. Voli energy drink.

n2aiqey,2025-07-10 02:12:16,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ how long did you leave the bleach on? did you use 30vol developer with the powder? it will be really really difficult, probably impossible, to go back in with another round of bleach and not cause breakage from overlap between the roots and the lengths that were already lightened. this is too dark to fix with toner though. **your options are (in order of riskiest to least risky):** 1 - another round of lightening with a volume 10 developer. i would section the hair into quarters, then very precisely apply the bleach as carefully as possible to only the darker section, on only one quarter of your hair. process that quarter, watching super carefully (wiping off a bit of the lightener to check every 5-10mins) and washing out as soon as its light enough. start with a section in the back first so if you get breakage, it's only to one quarter of the hair in the back. do the whole head by completely lightening one quarter of the hair at a time, this would give you the most control and reduce the risk of damage. if something goes wrong with the first section and you end up with a lot of breakage, you could do the rest of the hair with one of these other options. if this is successful, you'd tone with a vol 5 or 10 developer and a light blonde toner. 2 - using a high lift blonde color on the dark band of the hair. look up videos/tutorials about this to see how it works. 3 - coloring the dark band with a darker blonde color (something like a level 7 or 8) and then doing a root tap (right at the root, like an inch) with a shade or two darker (level 7 or 6) than the color you use on the whole dark band. this is the safest bet and would cause the least amount of damage. you could also consider doing some lowlights throughout the lengths with the darker color you use on the band to help add dimension and make things look more blended. regardless of which you choose, i'd still recommend a level 7-8 root tap! it just looks nicer and more professional, esp. when you have darker hair naturally. and with all of these options, you should definitely pick up an olaplex dupe. the type you mix into both bleach and/or toner, not the hair oil or shampoo/conditioner. this will make a huge difference in whether your hair incurs a lot of damage or only a little. sally's has one in their ion line, and there are also other brands on amazon. look up how to use them first, just search on youtube for ‚Äúolaplex bleach dupe‚Äù. i would also pick up k18 to use before / after any more coloring. it would help a lot too. you can buy tiny bottles for $12 that give you 1-2 applications or a decent size bottle for $29 on amazon. the bigger bottle would be better and help preserve your hair longer term since you're processing it so much. and also buy a bond repair shampoo/conditioner to help reduce breakage, redken's is decent and affordable."

En un mundo saturado de est√≠mulos, el verdadero lujo es discreto, √≠ntimo, casi secreto. El perfume s√≥lido de Lalique lo sabe bien: una joya encapsulada en un formato inesperado, sofisticado, y hoy, por solo 39 euros en Amazon por Prime Day, se convierte en el arma silenciosa de quienes prefieren seducir sin estruendo. Los perfumes s√≥lidos no son nuevos, pero Lalique convierte esta categor√≠a en arte. Inspirado en la tradici√≥n de la perfumer√≠a francesa y en el legado de su fundador, el artista Ren√© Lalique, este perfume es una pieza de colecci√≥n que desaf√≠a la idea convencional de lo olfativo. No hay frasco de vidrio ni vaporizador; hay un estuche elegante, compacto, que se desliza como un secreto en la palma de la mano o dentro de un clutch de noche. ¬øEl aroma? √çntimo, envolvente, con esa firma floral-amaderada que no busca complacer a todos, sino acompa√±arte de cerca. Porque el perfume s√≥lido no se lleva para que los dem√°s lo noten, se lleva para que t√∫ lo sientas. Es piel, es memoria, es ritual. Su textura cremosa permite aplicar justo donde debe: en los puntos de pulso, donde el calor del cuerpo lo activa y lo vuelve parte de ti. En mu√±ecas, cuello, clav√≠culas‚Ä¶ lugares que no se eligen al azar, sino por deseo. Y al ser s√≥lido, es perfecto para viajar, para llevar en la bolsa, para reaplicar sin llamar la atenci√≥n. Sin derrames, sin riesgos. Solo elegancia pura. El fijador de maquillaje viral de Amazon que revive delineadores y ahorra maquillaje     Rizos sin frizz, sin rigidez y con brillo: s√≠, existe, se llama Olaplex en Amazon     Glow overnight: el secreto de las influencers de belleza para piel radiante est√° en Amazon Lalique no hace concesiones. Cada detalle del packaging, del acabado, del dise√±o, remite a la herencia de una maison que entiende el lujo como algo que se hereda, se siente y se respeta. En ese contexto, 39 euros por este perfume s√≥lido no es un gasto: es una inversi√≥n en una experiencia sensorial que puedes tocar y que nadie m√°s tiene que ver. Adem√°s, estamos hablando de Prime Day. Un evento donde abunda lo pr√°ctico y lo masivo, pero rara vez aparecen objetos que, como este, invitan a la contemplaci√≥n y al hedonismo personal. Si hay un momento para darte ese lujo, es este. Por eso, si quieres llevar contigo algo m√°s que una fragancia‚Äîun s√≠mbolo de estilo, de discreci√≥n y de belleza contenida‚Äîeste perfume s√≥lido de Lalique est√° esperando. Y durante el Prime Day, por 39 euros, se vuelve alcanzable sin perder ni una gota de su m√≠stica. @mundistyle"

Uno de ellos es ver tus manos impecables, con un esmalte que no se quiebra al segundo caf√© ni desaparece al lavar platos. El OPI Gel con color, esmalte en gel para u√±as, una de las f√≥rmulas m√°s profesionales del mercado, ahora est√° en oferta por solo 20 euros en Amazon gracias al Prime Day. Un precio m√°s que justo por una manicura que dura semanas, brilla como reci√©n hecha y te ahorra citas innecesarias en el sal√≥n. OPI no es cualquier marca. Es un nombre que suena en pasarelas, sets de cine y manos de celebridades. Pero m√°s all√° de lo aspiracional, ha construido su reputaci√≥n en una f√≥rmula real: larga duraci√≥n, pigmentaci√≥n intensa y un acabado gel que compite con el de los mejores salones profesionales. Su l√≠nea GelColor, en particular, es la joya del portafolio, dise√±ada para brindar ese efecto ‚Äúreci√©n pintado‚Äù por hasta tres semanas. Y ahora, por solo 20 euros, puedes tener ese resultado sin salir de casa. En un mundo donde el tiempo escasea y las prioridades cambian, la manicura en gel casera es un nuevo acto de autonom√≠a. Ya no es solo est√©tica: es una declaraci√≥n. Te cuidas, te ves bien y lo haces a tu manera. El secreto de este esmalte est√° en su tecnolog√≠a de gel semipermanente, que cura bajo l√°mpara LED y sella el color con un brillo que no se opaca con los d√≠as. No hay retoque constante, ni esquinas despostilladas. El color permanece intacto, como si el tiempo no pasara. Y eso, en t√©rminos beauty, es casi un superpoder. Seis euros, un milagro capilar y cero grasa: as√≠ act√∫a el No. 6 de Olaplex en Amazon     Cuidado minimalista y efectivo: la crema que los dermat√≥logos no dejan de recomendar     Protecci√≥n 360¬∫ y cero dramas: as√≠ es cuidar la piel at√≥pica bajo el sol, gracias Amazon Adem√°s, su paleta de tonos no se queda en lo b√°sico. Desde los nudes sofisticados tipo ‚Äúyour nails but better‚Äù hasta rojos ic√≥nicos y tonos modernos con car√°cter, cada color parece tener historia y actitud. Porque en OPI, elegir un tono es tambi√©n elegir un estado de √°nimo. Si eres de las que valora el acabado de sal√≥n pero tambi√©n quiere libertad y practicidad, este esmalte es para ti. Solo necesitas una base, una l√°mpara LED (que hoy puedes encontrar por menos de lo que cuesta una visita al nail bar) y un poco de paciencia para aplicar en capas finas. El resultado: u√±as dignas de portada de revista, hechas por ti. Este Prime Day no es solo una oportunidad para renovar gadgets. Es una invitaci√≥n a apostar por ti y por esos peque√±os gestos de poder personal que elevan tu d√≠a a d√≠a. El OPI GelColor no es solo un esmalte: es una herramienta de belleza y empoderamiento en clave contempor√°nea. Por 20 euros, te llevas semanas de brillo profesional, sin prisas, sin citas, sin salir de casa. Y eso, honestamente, vale m√°s de lo que cuesta. @mundistyle"

n2cngus,2025-07-10 12:20:04,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ If you're not using leave in conditioner, you're skipping a very important step in the hair process. In addition it's very possible that your hair just doesn't like the specific shampoo and conditioner that you are using. Here's my full routine: > ü´ß Shampoo & Conditioner: Invest in a high-quality shampoo and conditioner, preferably those enriched with natural oils. These oils can penetrate the scalp and nourish the hair follicles, promoting healthy growth from the roots. However, avoid products containing coconut oil, as it can clog pores and potentially hinder hair growth > üß¥Deep Conditioner: any type will work. Start by dampening your hair, then apply the deep conditioner and cover your hair with a plastic cap. Follow this with a heated cap, which you can easily find on Amazon. These caps are microwaveable and help open up the hair cuticle and pores, allowing the nutrients to penetrate more effectively. This process also softens the hair and adds much-needed moisture, making it more manageable and less prone to tangling. Deep conditioning is a must. > ü™ºProtein Treatment:  once a week or every two weeks can help keep your hair strong and resilient. However, be careful not to overdo it, as too much protein can lead to buildup and brittleness. An affordable and effective option is the Elizavecca brand. > üß¥Leave-In Conditioner: This is a must-have in any hair care routine, as it helps protect your hair from heat damage. Despite common misconceptions, leave-in conditioner isn't just for curly hair‚Äîany hair type can benefit from it. It helps retain moisture and is typically applied from the mid-lengths to the ends of your hair. This is typically applied when hair is wet and brushed after the shower. > üõ¢Ô∏è Oil Your Hair ‚Äì Using the right oils can make a big difference in your hair health. There are oils specifically for the scalp and others meant for the mid-lengths to ends. For the scalp, opt for nourishing oils like rosemary oil, pumpkin seed oil, peppermint oil, or Jamaican black castor oil‚Äîthese can help stimulate growth and improve scalp health. For the mid-lengths to ends, Olaplex oil is an excellent choice. It's lightweight, effective, and won't leave behind any greasy residue. > üíÜüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Scalp Massage: Each night, take a small amount of one of the oils mentioned earlier, dab it onto your fingertips, and gently massage it into your scalp. This helps stimulate the hair follicles, which can promote healthy hair growth. Also, I want you to be aware that clarifying does remove buildup however if you are not using silicone then there's no reason for you to use a clarifying shampoo. I would get shampoos and conditioner that are based on moisture that are more natural!"

1lwncjl,2025-07-10 20:30:21,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ Hey guys, if you missed it, Olaplex finally agreed to settle with investors over failing to disclose risks tied to a now-banned ingredient in its top product. The final terms are still in progress, but since they're already accepting claims, I decided to share them with you with a little FAQ. Long story short, in 2021, Olaplex announced the reformulation of its flagship No. 3 Hair Perfector to remove lilial‚Äîa chemical banned in the EU due to infertility concerns. However, it continued to sell older stock containing the ingredient without informing investors. When the issue exploded in 2022, $OLPX stock collapsed, and investors filed a lawsuit. The good news is that $OLPX finally settled with investors, and they're accepting claims. **So here is a little FAQ for this settlement:** *Q. Who can claim this settlement? * A. All persons and entities who purchased or otherwise acquired Olaplex's publicly traded common stock pursuant and/or traceable to the Offering Documents for Olaplex's IPO, and who were damaged thereby. *Q. Do I need to sell/lose my shares to get this settlement? * A. No, if you have purchased the shares during the class period, you are eligible to participate. *Q. How much will my payment be? * A. The final payout amount depends on your specific trades and the number of investors participating in the settlement. *Q. How long does the payout process take? * A. It typically takes 4 to 9 months after the claim deadline for payouts to be processed, depending on the court and settlement administration. You can check if you are eligible and file a claim here: [https://11th.com/cases/olaplex-investor-suit](https://11th.com/cases/olaplex-investor-suit)"

It will raise your colour maybe to something more caramel or lighter but do not use bleach!!! They will say oh we will use Olaplex or whatever story but it will destroy your hair. High lift tint only works on virgin hair and is super gentle! Ask them to balayage with high lift tint no bleach period. They won't like it they all like to use bleach but too bad it's your hair if the colour is a shade you don't like you can use toning shampoos and treatment after that can add pigment but my biggest regret is ever dealing with bleach my hair continually breaks off at the ends even though I haven't used it for almost 2 years, once I discovered high lift tint I never went back. The shade works out great for me too. Google a bit about it!"

Kenra platinum blow-dry spray is almost always everyone's favorite at the salon. It smells DELICIOUS, use it to reduce blow dry time and get beautiful results! Styling for longevity? Use the platinum heat block spray for high gold before using hot tools! Wanna protect those strands? Igk good behavior smells like cookies and supports smooth flat iron styles. Antisocial is my personal favorite igk product, it's an aerosol overnight hair mask that you don't need to rinse out, it's like your silk bonnet in a bottle. Verb ghost, we know I love some verb, ghost oil and ghost dry oil can nourish those ends for any hair type. K18 detox shampoo is your clarifying bestie, and it's color safe! Follow up with the lightweight oil and let it sit for 4 minutes to get some repair and protection at home. And last but not least, for soft and manageable volume I am a fan of the olaplex volume blow dry mist. Pair with no. 6 leave in bond smoother to strengthen and fight frizz!

n2kdnp8,2025-07-11 15:31:29,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ I had virgin hair, waist length, it's been growing out the blonde since 2022. My hair started shedding last fall, I got scared, then I did my own moneypiece around NYE. It was great, my hair was still thinning but was soft and long. I thought it was sebderm or something making me shed the hair. I got a Bioderma Node DS shampoo to try and fix it, and it burned off my highlights and fried my hair. Now my ends are breaking off (I did trim it by 5cm! after the burn, but it is still breaking off, the virgin length...) I tried giving myself another moneypiece to feel better about my hair, but they fell out after a wash or two... I tried Olaplex, K18, still breaking off and bow up to boob-length. And it withstood manic bleaching my whole life, I don't know what they put in the shampoo, but I lost the curls, too. I like to think it protected me from a curse or something, my hair :,)"
n2kgbog,2025-07-11 15:43:46,en,REDDIT,"‚Äâ My recommendation: maybe it's the products that you used like a specific ingredient that made your hair break off / damage it :(  i strongly recommend you try olaplex #8 before bed if you are willing to try something ( I use it after my shower before blowdry ) but also sometimes before bed too . If you like something light definitely try on Amazon ‚ÄúChristophe Robin ‚Äú leave in spray the aloe Vera one, and spray that in the morning! It will help calm down the hairs that are sticking out Both these products have helped my hair the most compared to everythinggggggg I've ever tried On the bright side , your hair from a certain point looks great no damage so you should be seeing it grow out nice but keep an eye on it because if the line where the damage starts like remains the same , then it's definitely something happening to the hair that is causing the damage ! Enjoy your hair journey xoxo"

mov_F25A274A34C8973C75C9E46D06E48C91,2025-07-12 06:51:00,es,WEB,"‚Äâ SPR_COMBO[es]Durante a√±os se nos ense√±√≥ que limpiar la piel era un tr√°mite: algo que se hac√≠a r√°pido, con lo que fuera, solo para pasar al ‚Äúskincare real‚Äù. Pero basta de subestimar el primer paso. Porque si lo que usas para limpiar tu rostro lo irrita, lo reseca o lo intoxica, el resto de tu rutina ya est√° trabajando en desventaja. Y ah√≠ es donde esta leche limpiadora 99% natural, por solo 16 euros en Amazon durante el Prime Day, entra como un acto de reconciliaci√≥n con tu piel y con tu l√≥gica. El concepto de ‚Äúleche limpiadora‚Äù puede sonar a ritual vintage, de esos que usaban nuestras madres o abuelas, pero eso no la hace menos vigente. Al contrario: el formato ha evolucionado, pero la l√≥gica sigue siendo impecable. Una buena leche limpiadora ‚Äîcomo esta‚Äî limpia, desmaquilla, nutre y respeta la barrera cut√°nea. Todo al mismo tiempo. ¬øY qu√© hace distinta a esta en particular? Primero, su origen natural: 99% de sus ingredientes vienen de la naturaleza. No hay siliconas disfrazadas, ni perfumes agresivos, ni alcohol que reseca. Solo lo necesario: aceites vegetales, extractos bot√°nicos, emolientes suaves. Y eso, en pieles sensibles, no es un capricho: es supervivencia. El blush rosad de 3 euros que deja efecto Rare Beauty perfecto y sin gastar de m√°s     El fijador de maquillaje viral de Amazon que revive delineadores y ahorra maquillaje     Rizos sin frizz, sin rigidez y con brillo: s√≠, existe, se llama Olaplex en Amazon Adem√°s, su textura es cremosa pero no pesada, lo que permite masajearla con calma, incluso sobre maquillaje cargado. ¬øR√≠mel waterproof? ¬øBase full cover? Esta leche los derrite sin restregar, y sin dejar la piel como cart√≥n mojado. El efecto post-limpieza es clave: no tira, no pica, no enrojece. Al contrario, se siente como un primer gesto de autocuidado real, no como un tr√°mite apurado antes de aplicar el siguiente suero. En t√©rminos culturales, esta leche representa algo que va m√°s all√° de la f√≥rmula. Representa el retorno al skincare sensato, a esa limpieza que no busca dejar la piel ‚Äúchillando de limpia‚Äù, sino c√≥moda, balanceada, real. En un mercado saturado de activos potentes, exfoliantes qu√≠micos y promesas antiage extremas, volver a lo b√°sico es casi radical. Esta leche limpiadora no grita ""tendencia"", pero s√≠ susurra ‚Äúpiel feliz‚Äù al o√≠do. Y en una √©poca donde el skincare puede volverse performance, a veces lo m√°s transformador es elegir la opci√≥n que no duele, no reseca y no abruma. A 16 euros por Prime Day, no es una ganga. Es un regreso al sentido com√∫n, bien formulado. @mundistyle"

B31196853518497590978B9CEF70CBB6,2025-07-14 06:31:21,en,PRINT,"‚Äâ MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage (I charge from ¬£1,150 for mine). Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 (¬£19.55, www.amazon.co.uk), Olaplex No.8 (¬£22.40, www.sephora.co.uk) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer (¬£21, www.boots.com). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner (¬£27, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner (¬£26, www.harrods.com). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now ¬£17.99, sha op.toni www.ndguy.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now ¬£12, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo (¬£24.50, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment (¬£25). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist...."

I have natural 3c hair. After washing, I deep condition it and use a heat protectant. Currently using Fino Hair mask by Shiseido and Refill My Hair by ICE to style it and protect it from the heat but recently I feel like my hair is in need of something more. I can't find Olaplex anywhere (I usually check Boots, TK Max and Superdrugs) and I would rather not get it from Amazon. So I'm thinking about some alternatives. Also, I'm open to new suggestions of hair masks that would help with veeeery dry hair!! Thanks!!"

Whether your hair is naturally dry or parched from excessive color treatments and heat styling, brittle strands are a stubborn bummer. And as you know by now, dryness doesn't discriminate‚Äîeven oily scalps can lead to straw-like strands. Cherin Choi, a bicoastal hairstylist, emphasizes the importance of selecting a formula with ingredients that cater to the specific needs of dry hair, setting you up for long-term success. ‚ÄúOpt for shampoos containing nourishing oils, aloe vera, or hyaluronic acid to hydrate without weighing hair down,‚Äù she advises. That's why we combed through the backs of beloved bottles, checked in with experts to learn why they work, and made sure our editors gave them a good suds to see what the hype is all about. Our top pick was the HairStory New Wash, a lather-less shampoo (yes, that's right) that offers a milky cleanse hydrating enough to skip the conditioner if you please. Other options on this list will work overtime to repair your split ends, fight dandruff, and more. Best shampoos for dry hair, at a glance How we tested shampoo for dry hair AccordionItemContainerButtonLargeChevron We tested shampoo for dry hair based on ingredients, texture, how well they lathered (and washed out), and how our hair felt post-wash and beyond. The best shampoos had ingredients like hyaluronic acid and ceramides to deeply nourish, hydrate and detangle strands, and all gave us a nice thick and creamy lather. Finally, the ones that made this list kept our hair velvety smooth, flyaway and static free. Post two to three washes, our strands were soft, smooth and moisturized for days. Best Overall: New Wash by HairStory Courtesy of brand HairStory New Wash $46 Amazon Ingredient highlights: aloe vera leaf juice, evening primrose oil, sunflower seed oil Smells like: lightly floral Safe for color-treated hair: yes Size: 8 oz Hair Type: all While the idea of a non-foaming shampoo might raise an eyebrow (who doesn't love a rich lather?) , Hairstory's New Wash makes a compelling case. Too much foam can actually dry out your hair, which is why this formula transforms into a milky wash instead‚Äîcleansing, conditioning, supporting scalp health, and enhancing texture, all without harsh detergents. It's a favorite of Choi for good reason: it works on all hair types, plays nice with color-treated strands, and can even replace your conditioner if you're a one-and-done kind of washer. You're welcome to follow up with a conditioner, but we love the built-in convenience. Best for Dry Hair and an Oily Scalp: K18 Peptide Prep Detox Shampoo Courtesy of brand Original photo from Alanna Martine Kilkeary testing K18 Peptide Prep Detox Shampoo Original photo from Alanna Martine Kilkeary testing K18 Peptide Prep Detox Shampoo ChevronChevron K18 Peptide Prep Detox Shampoo $38 Amazon $38 Sephora Ingredient highlights: activated charcoal, salicylic acid, peptides Smells like: citrus Safe for color-treated hair: yes Size: 8.5 oz Hair Type: all textures, dry but oily If you're among the, erm, lucky few with dry hair and an oily scalp, you probably have a few choice words for your genetics. But take a deep breath‚ÄîK18's Clarifying Shampoo might just be your hair's saving grace. It's a favorite of Choi and Ebony Knight, stylist and owner of Textured Press. ‚ÄúIt's actually also a chelating shampoo, which means that it penetrates the outer layer of the hair shaft into the middle and removes metals and toxins‚Äîgreat for anyone who uses hard water to shampoo and condition hair,‚Äù Knight explains. ‚ÄúWhile this shampoo is suitable for all hair types, I found it to be extra useful for my fine hair, which tends to get oily at the root...."

Getting your locks to look their best can often be a struggle, especially if you have textured, coloured or damaged hair, as so many of us do. Often, it's the products we think are helping our hair that are actually harming it, so, it's time to reach for the best sulphate-free shampoos. Sulphates are the chemicals and ingredients added to shampoos that give you that clean-hair feeling. They remove dirt, grease and other impurities, and create that bubbly lather we all know and love. However, they can also strip hair of its natural oil and moisture, leaving it more brittle, lifeless and likely to shed or snap. So, what do we do? Well, the good news is sulphate-free shampoos are gradually becoming the norm, providing nourishing alternatives that can cleanse your hair and scalp without being too harsh. I spoke to Emma Vickery, art director at Percy and Reed, who's spent most of her career obsessing over how we should look after our hair. ‚ÄúProducts are far more gentle and kind to the hair and skin without sulphates ‚Äì any other good ingredients in the formulations are now no longer compromised by being intermixed with them,‚Äù says Vickery. As for finding the right product for your particular locks, I've put a whole range of formulas through their paces. No matter what you're looking for ‚Äì from frizz-fighting to colour protection ‚Äì you're sure to find the best sulphate-free shampoo for you in this round-up. How I tested the best sulphate-free shampoos Trying out a wide range of sulphate-free shampoos ‚Äì from luxury salon-style buys to budget-friendly brands ‚Äì I have never looked at my hair so closely before, making sure to take note of even the slightest changes. This started by making sure I kept the rest of my haircare routine the same, so any changes could be attributed to the new shampoo. When testing, I considered key factors such as: Ease of use: I looked at how effortlessly each product lathered (despite the absence of sulphates), how simple it was to rinse out, and whether the packaging was practical and user-friendly. Shampoos that required excessive effort to distribute evenly or left behind residue were marked down, while those that provided a smooth, intuitive washing experience stood out. Scent: While personal preference varies, I prioritised shampoos with pleasant fragrances that didn't overpower or linger too long after rinsing. Since sulphate-free formulas often rely on more natural ingredients, I also noted whether the scent felt clean and fresh or overly artificial. Results: The final look and feel of the hair were central to testing. I assessed how each product left the hair after washing ‚Äì looking for softness, shine, manageability, and overall health. Shampoos that made hair feel clean but not stripped, smooth but not weighed down, ranked highest. I also noted improvements in frizz control, curl definition, or volume where relevant.

I can not recommend enough the defining, frizz-fighting and softening benefits of Umberto Giannini's curl jelly wash to anyone with a slight texture or curl to their mane ‚Äì thank me later, is all I have to say. Meanwhile, the Olaplex no.4 bond maintenance shampoo gave me soft, shiny, defined curls and lots of compliments. Close behind is Living Proof's frizz shampoo, as it did exactly as it said on the tin, defeating any frizz in sight and leaving me with a gorgeous scent I'll keep coming back for. I was also blown away by the capabilities and natural ingredients of Sukin's natural balance shampoo, especially as the size is so generous for the price. What are sulphates? Essentially, sulphates are chemicals used as a cleaning agent in products such as shampoo, shaving gel and shower wash. It's what causes the foam when washing your hair, which, for most people, tells them it's doing its job of removing dirt. But, for certain types of hair ‚Äì such as curly hair ‚Äì using sulphates can be damaging, and it can even cause skin irritation for some. What does a sulphate-free shampoo actually do? This type of shampoo works much like any other regular formula but the ingredient list is where you'll find the most differences, due to the lack of sulphates. While they might sound harmless, sulphate ingredients can cause the scalp's natural oils, which help to keep strands healthy, to be stripped away, and they can even cause some skin irritation. Is sulphate-free shampoo good for hair? Some people prefer their shampoo to be foamy, in which case sulphate-free shampoo might not be for you. However, there are a lot of benefits to be had from staying clear of this chemical, such as reducing frizz and scalp irritation, as well as leaving hair softer and better conditioned, while it can also help curly hair stay intact...."

Y lo hace con fuerza. El Amla en Polvo Org√°nico, usado durante siglos en la medicina ayurv√©dica, ha regresado con el poder de una tendencia pero con la solidez de una tradici√≥n. Este polvo vegetal, derivado del fruto indio Phyllanthus emblica, est√° conquistando rituales de cuidado natural por su capacidad real de transformar tanto el cabello como la piel. Y ahora est√° por solo 14 euros en Amazon durante Prime Day, sin marketing excesivo, sin f√≥rmulas vac√≠as. Solo naturaleza en su forma m√°s pura. La versatilidad del Amla es parte de su atractivo. Como mascarilla capilar, fortalece la ra√≠z, frena la ca√≠da, estimula el crecimiento y da ese efecto de volumen sano que no depende de siliconas ni ceras sint√©ticas. Es ideal para cabellos debilitados, te√±idos o simplemente cansados de procesos qu√≠micos. En una √©poca donde muchas f√≥rmulas capilares prometen pero no cumplen, el Amla act√∫a con constancia, no con promesas m√°gicas. Basta con mezclarlo con agua tibia hasta formar una pasta y aplicarlo en cuero cabelludo y largos. El resultado no es inmediato como con un s√©rum con siliconas, pero s√≠ profundo. El cabello se siente m√°s fuerte, m√°s denso y con una textura que recuerda al pelo virgen: grueso, brillante y con vida propia. El blush rosad de 3 euros que deja efecto Rare Beauty perfecto y sin gastar de m√°s     El fijador de maquillaje viral de Amazon que revive delineadores y ahorra maquillaje     Rizos sin frizz, sin rigidez y con brillo: s√≠, existe, se llama Olaplex en Amazon ¬øY en la piel? Tambi√©n hay magia. Aplicado como mascarilla facial (mezclado con yogur natural o miel), el Amla ilumina, desinflama y ayuda a igualar el tono. Su alta concentraci√≥n de vitamina C, antioxidantes y taninos ayuda a reducir manchas, cerrar poros y aportar esa luminosidad natural que no se logra con iluminadores. No pica, no arde, no irrita, y es perfecto para pieles mixtas o grasas que necesitan limpieza profunda sin agresi√≥n. Otro punto a favor es su pureza: sin conservantes, sin perfumes, sin ingredientes extra√±os. Este es uno de esos productos que entiendes con solo leer el empaque. Viene en formato de 200 gramos, lo que alcanza para m√∫ltiples aplicaciones tanto capilares como faciales. ¬øPor qu√© importa tanto el regreso de ingredientes como el Amla? Porque, en medio de una industria obsesionada con lo nuevo, lo ancestral regresa con la fuerza de lo que ha sido probado durante siglos. Porque hay algo profundamente honesto en usar un fruto molido como mascarilla. Porque no todo necesita oler a mango artificial ni prometer ‚Äúpiel de filtro‚Äù para ser efectivo. El Amla en Polvo Org√°nico no es tendencia, es permanencia. Su valor no est√° solo en sus propiedades, sino en c√≥mo nos conecta con una belleza m√°s consciente, m√°s lenta y m√°s real. Por 14 euros en Amazon por Prime Day, es una inversi√≥n natural y poderosa en ti. Porque a veces, menos ciencia cosm√©tica y m√°s sabidur√≠a vegetal es justo lo que tu rutina estaba esperando. @mundistyle"

397059B84031EE2F45D751CA8833E1A2,2025-07-16 08:01:56,en,PRINT,"‚Äâ by Tom Smith MY clients are international tastemakers, royalty and millionaires who live as if it's summer all year round. Their hair has to look fresh, expensive and effortless - whether they're at a board meeting in Dubai or barefoot on the Amalfi Coast. What many don't realise is the way we treat our hair in the summer has the power to age it, rapidly. Dullness, dehydration, brittleness, colour-fade and breakage all adds up - and affects what I call your 'hair age'. By using a few simple tricks you can avoid damage and keep your hair in its peak condition right through to September and beyond. These are the eight rules I tell my clients to follow to help anti-age their hair... 1. A MESSY BUN FOR A FREE BALAYAGE OF COURSE, the best way to protect your hair from the sun would be to cover it with a hat or a silk scarf, but when you can't, don't rely on those UV protection hair mists - they aren't as effective as sunscreen. The smartest thing might be to wear your hair up. A messy bun keeps your scalp and parting shaded (preventing sunburn and root fade), while letting the sun naturally lighten your hairline and ends - the exact places we target in a professional balayage. Just don't forget to apply a facial sunscreen right up into your hairline. It'll protect both your skin and those delicate front hairs from becoming damaged. I like La Roche-Posay Anthelios Invisible Anti-Shine Mist, which won't overload your hairline, while Supergoop! SPF Mineral Powder is great to brush into finer hairlines or partings and doesn't leave an oily residue. 2. A BUN IS BETTER THAN A BLOW-DRY AT NIGHT NOBODY wants to blow-dry their hair on a balmy summer's night, so use this multi-tasking hack instead: apply your favourite mask or conditioner through clean damp hair, comb in a middle or side parting, and twist into a sleek bun. You need the parting for a nighttime look - you want to look polished, after all. Secure it with a statement scrunchie or subtle pins and pair with a bold earring and/or lip colour. This look is chic enough for dinner, but secretly treats your hair at the same time. Think of it as repair disguised as a hairstyle - it's comfortable, practical and the ultimate habit stack! I recommend Olaplex No.3 ((EURO)29.50, www.brownthomas.com), Olaplex No.8 ((EURO)29.50, www.arnotts.ie) or Philip Kingsley Elasticizer ((EURO)24.45, www.lookfantastic.ie). 3. YOUR HAIR NEEDS AFTER-SUN, TOO JUST like your skin, your hair dries out fast in the sun. UV rays, saltwater and chlorine strip away essential moisture and lipids, leaving your strands brittle, dull and extra prone to snapping. Adding extra moisture to your ends regularly can be the difference between saving your sunkissed lengths and being forced into a bob come autumn. A good leave-in conditioner might just be your simplest answer - keep one in your beach bag and mist it over damp hair after swimming (even if you can't rinse). It'll rehydrate your lengths and actually help your natural waves form better as they dry. Back at your hotel, upgrade your conditioner to a deep moisture mask, and get into the habit of daily leave-in hydration, morning and night! Think of it as after-sun, but for your hair. Try Amika Leave-In Hydro Rush Conditioner ((EURO)31, www.spacenk.com) or Ouai Leave In Conditioner ((EURO)30, www.boots.ie). 4. THREE STEPS FOR POOL-PROOFING CHLORINE can be brutal on hair, but here's a three-step strategy to outsmart it. At an absolute minimum follow step one: always soak your hair in clean water before diving in. Like a sponge, wet hair absorbs less of the pool water than dry hair. For extra points, add step two: slather on your thickest, oiliest mask (a budget one such as Cantu Deep Treatment Masque will do). It acts as a barrier and treats your hair while you swim: just be sure to shampoo it out properly after. For maximum protection, continue to step three: avoid dunking your head underwater if you can, especially if you've recently had colour, if your hair is porous or prone to damage - prevention is better than cure! You won't go wrong using Redken Frizz Dismiss Mask (now (EURO)22.49, www.cloud10beauty.com) or Bondiboost Anti Frizz Mask (now (EURO)14, www.sephora.co.uk). 5. PROTECT YOUR GREYS GREY hair can look bright and beautiful but it's especially vulnerable in the summertime. Naturally more porous, it absorbs everything - from sunscreen and fake tan to seawater and chlorine. Glossy grey strands can quickly turn yellow, dull and stained with pollutants that may be tricky to get rid of. Avoid letting your fake tan touch your hair - this will very quickly give grey or blonde strands an unsightly bronze tone that can be hard to remove. And never run skincare-covered hands through greyer sections. Pack a purple shampoo just in case (it can help to cancel out brassiness before it sets in). I like Evo Fabuloso Platinum Shampoo ((EURO)28.20, www.sephora.co.uk) and Evo Fabuloso Platinum Colour Boosting Treatment ((EURO)28). 6. DITCH THE LIGHTENING SPRAY ADMITTEDLY, those nostalgic sprays that promise golden, beachy highlights can work - but unless you're already blonde and don't plan to colour your hair, they're risky! These lightening sprays often turn darker hair more orange than blonde, and can be wildly incompatible with professional salon colour, sometimes causing chemical reactions that lead to breakage or unpredictable results. If you've used one, always tell your colourist...."

Some afforable¬†Eos Shea Butter Vanilla Cashmere body lotion¬†that TikTokers are tripping over themselves to get as they swear it moisturizes and smells as good as much more expensive options from brands like Philosophy and Bath & Body Works. Promising reviews: ""I first saw this lotion on¬†TikTok; an influencer was bragging about it! Let me tell you, she did not lie. This lotion is the BEST. It smells fantastic. A cross between cotton candy and vanilla, it's just so fresh. It makes my skin smooth all day. This large bottle will last me a couple of months. Thank you, Eos, for such a fantastic lotion.¬† "" ‚ÄîErin ""Very similar to my Burberry fragrance, and they layer beautifully. I always get tons of compliments on the scent. I also purchase the jasmine and berry¬† for a more fruity option but to me it just smells like regular lotion. Cost per use is well worth it considering how thick the lotion is. It also actually moisturizes while leaving a fragrance behind instead of drying my skin out due to the perfume. I have sensitive skin and have had no adverse reactions."" ‚ÄîViolet Frahm Get it from Amazon for¬†$9.97¬†(available in various scents and packs). 2. A tube of¬†Essence's Lash Princess Mascara¬†to give you a falsies-level look for less than five bucks. It seems questionable, I know, but for confirmation, you need only look at the 262,000+ 5-star reviews!! Promising review: ""After using Lights, Camera, Lashes by Tarte for the past year, I got tired of breaking the bank over mascara. My sister suggested Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect and I IMMEDIATELY fell in love. It provides dramatic length and great volume. I can honestly say I can't stop looking at my eyelashes in the mirror every single day because of how awesome they look. Also, it is very long-wearing. I go from an eight-hour workday right to the gym and sweat [a lot]. . and this stuff doesn't budge! I love it!!"" ‚ÄîCarrie E Weikert Get it from Amazon for $4.99¬†(available in black or brown and as a three-pack). 3. A long-sleeve bodysuit in a deliciously soft fabric ‚Äî known as Smoke Cloud ‚Äî that¬†reviewers compare to Skims. They say it washes well, too, so you can count on it being high quality despite the deceivingly low price! And BTW, reviewers say the double lining in the torso is supportive, so they don't need to wear a bra. Promising review: ""Are you kidding me? This is the softest, most comfortable body suit I've ever owned. I got so many compliments lol; everyone did think they were Skims lol, but it's definitely worth every penny. I love and will be getting more colors!!! You need it."" ‚ÄîWendy L. Get it from Amazon for $28.99¬†(available in women's sizes XS‚Äì3X and 13 colors).
