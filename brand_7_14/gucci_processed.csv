Perforated Alaia belts currently run for $850 to $1,750 each, according to the French design house's site. Cyrus, who wore a custom crop top and skirt made by the brand at the 2025 Met Gala on May 5, is perhaps best-known today as a three-time Grammy-winning recording artist. But she first attained public recognition and wealth as a child actor — playing the titular character on the Disney Channel's TV show, ""Hannah Montana."" The show first aired in 2006, when Cyrus was 13 years old, and ran until 2011. Cyrus' affinity for high-end fashion hasn't gone away: In December, she purchased a vintage Bob Mackie dress at auction that was previously estimated to sell for up to $8,000, according to the Hollywood Reporter. (The actual price Cyrus paid remains undisclosed.) Clothing is a popular choice among newly minted celebrities, looking to spend their first big paycheck. NFL star Travis Kelce spent around $10,000 on a limited edition pair of Nike Air MAGs, he said on his ""New Heights"" podcast, in an episode that aired in May 2023. ""Saturday Night Live"" star Bowen Yang bought a pair of Gucci shoes with his first paycheck from the TV show, he told New York magazine in a video published on Dec. 4. ""The kind that everyone got, and the kind I wouldn't feel super cool wearing out now,"" Yang said. Other high-profile first big-money purchases include homes, sometimes for family members, or cars. Retired NBA star Shaquille O'Neal did both: He spent his first $1 million within hours on paying off his mom's house, three Mercedes Benzes — for himself, his dad and his mom — and ""rings and diamonds and earrings,"" he told Business Insider in November 2017. If you ever receive a windfall of money — whether that's winning the lottery or landing a job with a major pay raise — don't be hasty, financial experts advise. Working with estate and tax advisors can help you avoid unnecessary taxes, Warren Racusin, a wealth planning attorney and partner at Lowenstein Sandler, told CNBC in December 2023. Those financial experts can especially help you prevent regrettable spending decisions. At age 24, for example, comedian and actor Kevin Hart shelled out for a series of throwback jerseys from athletes like Julius Ervin, Reggie White, Magic Johnson and Larry Bird, he told CNBC Make It in October 2018. He declined to share how much he spent. ""If I had to put a number on it, I would say it was stupid plus stupid, which equals stupid, OK? I don't even feel comfortable talking about it,"" Hart said, adding: ""In my defense, so many people don't understand the value of money until they have it ... When you have it and lose it, you understand the value of it and its importance."" Also on CNBC"

But this early interest might be short-lived, considering the underwhelming shrug that audiences have greeted it with. Materialists is one of A24's most high-profile titles this year, after a handful of setbacks such as Death of a Unicorn and The Legend of Ochi . The indie outfit is counting on positive reviews and an attractive cast (that was at the center of a major marketing campaign) to pull audiences to theaters. But those who watched the movie on opening day weren't particularly impressed . Materialists holds a 71% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes, and was awarded a rather disappointing B- CinemaScore from opening day crowds, which is just one grade higher than Johnson's cataclysmic Madame Web . This doesn't necessarily reflect the movie's quality, but represents how likely a viewer is to recommend it to others. Typically, movies that score high on these metrics tend to do better at the box office. Not only is Materialists ' B- CinemaScore lower than the A grade earned by fellow new release How to Train Your Dragon , it's also lower than the B+ grades earned by Challengers , No Hard Feelings , and House of Gucci . Materialists is director Celine Song 's sophomore feature, following her widely acclaimed debut a couple of years ago with Past Lives . Starring Greta Lee , that movie was also released by A24; it earned more than $40 million globally, against a reported budget of $12 million. Past Lives earned Lee a Best Original Screenplay nomination at the Oscars, in addition to earning a Best Picture nod. It holds a 95% score on Rotten Tomatoes , which is higher than the 87% that Materialists is currently sitting at. A24 is Leveling Up at the Box Office Close In his review , Collider's Ross Bonaime hailed the movie as “ another modern romantic classic ,” and added, “it's like she's taken a good '90s romance, fleshed out the characters, story, and truths about modern dating, and turned it into something mesmerizing.” Produced on a reported budget of $20 million , Materialists is one of A24's bigger plays this year; it'll be followed by the Dwayne Johnson -led sports drama The Smashing Machine , and Timothée Chalamet 's new Oscars vehicle Marty Supreme , which is also supposedly the outfit's most expensive film yet.

They may be signs of structural constraint. — Nike said it was building “the future of sport.” Then quietly turned back to the platform it once left. Six months from DTC-first to platform-dependent.

Amazon = algorithmic shelf. — Gucci said it was ushering in a new era. But here we are—three months to September—and no Milan Fashion Week announcement. No confirmed show. No ritual. No runway. Is that creative silence? Or operational compromise? — What if both brands are making decisions under constraint—but marketing them as vision? ■ “Back to Amazon” isn't agility.

Instead, it conjures up images of vinyl records and toys still made out of metal. Check Out: 4 Lesser-Known Coins That Are Worth Thousands of Dollars For You: 6 Big Shakeups Coming to Social Security in 2025 If you are a collector, saver or even accidental hoarder of your old belongings, you could be sitting on a sneaky pile of cash. As a decade marked by unique cultural and aesthetic shifts, the 1970s produced a nostalgic treasure trove of vintage items worth a lot of money. The 70s was an era of bold styles, groundbreaking music and remarkable technological advancements. Items from this decade are sought after not just for their rarity but also for the stories they tell and the memories they evoke. If you're looking to make some extra cash, you don't need to go to a Heritage Auction with your Grandma's vintage Pyrex dishes. Whether you have iconic vintage toys, Boy Scout memorabilia or complete sets of limited-edition comic books in excellent condition, you could be significantly underestimating how much items from this era are worth. Collectors and enthusiasts alike are willing to pay high prices or even top dollar for well-preserved, authentic pieces. Here are five valuable 1970s collectibles you might just have stored in your attic or basement. In just the span of a few decades, Apple computers changed the game for personal and home computers, and this all started in the 1970s. The Apple I Computer, released in 1976, stands out for collectors as Apple's inaugural product. It was famously crafted by the legendary duo of Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak and embodies the pioneering spirit of the tech revolution. While the Apple II, which was released in 1977, cost about $1,300 at the time of its launch, now it could fetch you over an estimated $6,600. If it's in decent condition with its monitor, separate keyboard or casing and five-color on-screen graphics, it could be worth selling. Collectors avidly seek out original Apple-1 units, especially those in working condition or with their original packaging. These rare pieces can get a whopping $220,000 at auctions, which is a testament to their enduring significance in the tech world. Still, making a cool $6,000 for other vintage models isn't so bad either for what you once considered junk in your garage. Explore More: 7 McDonald's Toys Worth Way More Today The 1970s ushered in the golden age of video gaming, with several iconic consoles and games that have become highly sought-after by both gamers and collectors. The Atari video computer system, known as the Atari 2600 after 1977, was a trailblazer in gaming entertainment. Here are some examples of what just basic vintage games could make you if you sell them. Space Invaders (Atari 2600, 1978): $75 to $1,450 Pong (original Atari Pong C-100, 1972): $100 to $150 Asteroids (original arcade machine, 1979): $1,200 Collectors today prize well-maintained Atari consoles and rare game cartridges, with some fetching several thousand dollars. These home or arcade video games, particularly in their original, or best possible condition, can be valued between $1,000 to $5,000, making them a goldmine for those looking to clean out old boxes you've had stored since childhood. The 1970s were a golden era for toys, with several iconic brands and characters emerging that are still celebrated today, such as all things Star Wars. Following the release of this culturally transformative box office powerhouse in 1977, these figures became instant favorites. And the rarer the toy, the heftier the price tag, as you can see from the following insanely valuable Star Wars toys. Rocket-Firing Boba Fett Prototypes (1979): Only two dozen or so were made and this action figure had a different utility than other models. This would be why it sold for $204,435 at auction. Obi-Wan Kenobi with Double-Telescoping Lightsaber (1977): This is a rare Star Wars toy and sold at an auction for $76,000 in 2018. Double Telescoping Darth Vader (1977): Though the initial version never made it to market, the ones that do exist need heavy authentication. This particular version was purchased for $24,500 at an auction, still in its box. Particularly coveted are the originals and extremely rare models from the late 1970s, such as the Boba Fett figure with a firing rocket pack, action figures with different utilities than other models or just ones that didn't have a lot made. These figures, particularly in mint condition and original packaging, represent not just a piece of cinema history but a lucrative investment. The 70s fashion scene was marked by iconic trends of legendary designers strutted on the runways from some of the world's first supermodels. Original pieces from this era, particularly from fashion giants like Gucci, Halston, Bob Macki, Yves Saint Laurent and Dior, are highly coveted. These vintage items can range in price from several hundred to thousands of dollars, depending on the piece and its condition. If you have 1970s pieces in good condition just sitting in your closet, you should consider selling them online yourself or through sites like Thredup, which will buy your designer pieces for resale on its site. The late 1970s witnessed the advent of personal electronics that changed entertainment forever. The Sony Walkman TPS-L2, introduced in 1979, is a notable example. Now, it's fetching upwards of $2,300 on platforms like eBay. Similarly, the original Sony Trinitron color TVs are valued at $1,000 or more among collectors. In today's mindset of always throwing away your old phone to replace it with the newest model, it's nice to see that relics of the electronic past still have value. Before you toss your old retro televisions or Walkmans, it may be worth a Google search to see what they're worth on eBay...."

mov_88CB7C542077280DB545C7EF4993DAC4,2025-06-15 03:59:32,en,WEB,"  1. Humble Beginnings The story of the hoodie dates back to the Medieval era. Monks and outdoor laborers wore hooded robes and tunics to protect themselves from the harsh elements. These early hoods were practical rather than fashionable, serving as simple shields against rain and wind. 2. The Birth of the Modern Hoodie In the 1930s, the American company Champion introduced the first modern hooded sweatshirt. Initially, it was designed for athletes and workers in freezing warehouses. This practical garment quickly gained popularity among laborers who needed warmth and comfort during long shifts. 3. The 1970s — Hip-Hop Influence In the 1970s, the hoodie took on new cultural meaning. It became a symbol of street culture, heavily embraced by the emerging hip-hop community in New York City. Graffiti artists favored hoodies for their anonymity and warmth during late-night escapades. 4. Hollywood's Impact Movies played a vital role in popularizing the hoodie. Sylvester Stallone's character in Rocky immortalized the grey hoodie as a symbol of grit and determination. This iconic image cemented the hoodie as a must-have for athletes and fans alike. 5. A Symbol of Rebellion During the 1980s and 1990s, the hoodie became associated with rebellious youth. Skateboarders, punk rockers, and teenagers adopted it as an expression of anti-establishment attitudes. Schools and shopping malls often banned hoodies for women, giving them an even stronger underground appeal. 6. Rise in Sportswear Fashion Sports brands like Nike and Adidas began to design hoodies not just for functionality but also for style. Branded logos and vibrant colors turned this simple garment into a statement piece. By the late '90s, hoodies were common in casual streetwear collections. 7. Luxury Brands Join In In the 2000s, luxury fashion houses took notice. Designers like Ralph Lauren and later, Balenciaga and Gucci, reinvented the hoodie as a premium garment. Suddenly, an item once seen as working-class attire became high fashion, complete with hefty price tags. 8. The College Campus Staple Universities played a key role in the hoodie's spread. College students embraced hoodies printed with their campus logos. It became an unofficial uniform — cozy, versatile, and perfect for late-night study sessions or chilly lecture halls. 9. Pop Culture and Music Icons Hip-hop artists, pop stars, and influencers began sporting hoodies in music videos and public appearances. Stars like Kanye West and Rihanna transformed the hoodie into a symbol of contemporary cool, blending streetwear with luxury aesthetics. 10. Protest and Political Symbolism In recent decades, the hoodie has also become a symbol in social movements. The tragic death of Trayvon Martin in 2012 highlighted the hoodie as a symbol of racial profiling and injustice. Protesters wore unique hoodies to express solidarity and call for change. 11...."

mov_598AF7F0316C4C31855EF1EC3DEEB926,2025-06-15 15:06:52,en,WEB,"  Ridley Scott's latest thriller, Echo Valley, starring Sydney Sweeney and Julianne Moore, has made an immediate splash on the streaming scene, capturing the top spot on Apple TV+ just one day after its June 13 release. According to FlixPatrol, the film soared to #1 on Apple TV's Top 10 in the United States on June 14, 2025, knocking off the previously dominant Fountain of Youth, featuring John Krasinski and Natalie Portman, which had held the crown for over a week. Produced by Scott and directed by Michael Pearce, with a screenplay by Brad Ingelsby (known for The Lost Bus), Echo Valley had a limited theatrical release in the U.S. and Canada on June 6 before landing on Apple TV+. The film unfolds on a Pennsylvania farm named Echo Valley, where Kate Garrett (Julianne Moore) grapples with the recent loss of her wife, the mounting expenses of farm life, and the challenges posed by her troubled daughter Claire (Sydney Sweeney), who battles substance use disorder. The gripping narrative kicks into high gear when Claire arrives at Kate's doorstep covered in someone else's blood, triggering a tense thriller that sees Kate desperately trying to protect her daughter while unraveling the mystery behind the blood. The film's supporting cast includes Domhnall Gleeson (known for Harry Potter and Ex Machina), Kyle MacLachlan (Dune 1984), and Fiona Shaw (Harry Potter, Killing Eve). Domhnall Gleeson's character, Jackie Lawson, is a menacing drug dealer who becomes a central antagonist after Claire accidentally disposes of his stash. This act sets off a chain reaction: Claire's boyfriend, Ryan Sinclair (Edmund Donovan), begins dealing drugs laced with fentanyl to cover his debts, which tragically leads to an overdose death. Claire confides in Kate, claiming she killed Ryan in self-defense and begging her mother to help cover up the incident. In a heart-wrenching act of maternal protection, Kate sinks the wrapped body in a nearby lake. However, the plot thickens when Kate discovers the body isn't Ryan's. Jackie returns, holding Kate hostage and demanding money in exchange for silence. In a clever twist, Kate feigns bankruptcy but offers to provide insurance money if they burn down her barn to stage an accident. Using a flare, she sets the barn ablaze, placing the body inside and planting evidence to implicate Jackie, who was staying there. This masterstroke flips the power dynamic, showing Kate's fierce resolve beneath her grief-stricken exterior. Gleeson commented on his character's underestimation of Kate, saying, “He's just somebody who is always looking for a victim. He has an amazing spidey sense for people he can take advantage of, and I think he enjoys that.” Yet, “He underestimates her,” Gleeson noted, highlighting the film's theme of resilience and the unexpected strength of a mother fighting for her child. The film's ending leaves audiences with a haunting ambiguity. Claire returns to Kate's doorstep, tears streaming down her face, but neither speaks. The screen fades to black, leaving viewers pondering Claire's fate, her sobriety, and the future of their relationship. Gleeson reflects, “We all hoped for one thing, and we worry it'll be the other. And that's the same as being alive. We're all hoping things will go a certain way and are worried it won't.” Despite its rapid rise on streaming charts, Echo Valley has received mixed reviews. Rotten Tomatoes reports a critics' score of 50% and an audience rating of 59%. While critics have praised Julianne Moore's committed performance and the film's relatable premise, many felt the plot lacked originality, leaving some viewers wanting more. Meanwhile, Sydney Sweeney's star continues to rise. Beyond Echo Valley, she has an impressive slate of projects lined up. Her crime film Americana, which premiered at South by Southwest in 2023, is set for public release in August 2025. She's also attached to a film adaptation of the video game Split Fiction, collaborating with director Jon M. Chu and writers Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, known for their work on Deadpool and Wolverine. Sweeney is starring in and producing an untitled biopic about Christy Martin, the former professional boxer who survived an attempted murder. Later this year, she will appear alongside Amanda Seyfried in the psychological thriller The Housemaid, based on Freida McFadden's novel. Sweeney's rising prominence was on full display at the European premiere of Echo Valley in London, where she dazzled on the red carpet in an icy blue Miu Miu dress featuring a halter neckline, fitted bodice, and a keyhole cutout. She shared photos from the event on Instagram, captioning them, “London  ft my not so little bro.” Julianne Moore showed her support in the comments with three heart emojis, underscoring their on-screen and off-screen camaraderie. The buzz around Echo Valley is part of a broader wave of star-studded events and premieres. Around the same time, Michelle Monaghan stunned in a black leather Gabriela Hearst dress at a screening for the third season of The White Lotus in Los Angeles. Brooke Shields turned heads at the 78th Annual Tony Awards in a striking red Balmain mini dress, accessorized with a diamond necklace and a unique clutch made from Radio City Music Hall curtains. Dakota Johnson graced the premiere of The Materialists in a sleek black Gucci gown, while Blake Lively attended the Tribeca Artists Dinner hosted by Chanel in a delicate white lace dress, recently celebrating a legal victory in a defamation lawsuit. Amal and George Clooney posed elegantly together at the Tony Awards, with Amal wearing a pearl-draped white Tamara Ralph Haute Couture gown. Julianne Hough also caught eyes in a white Christian Siriano dress at the same event, marking the Tony Awards as her “fave night of the year.” As Echo Valley streams now on Apple TV+, it stands as a testament to Ridley Scott's knack for producing gripping, character-driven thrillers that spark conversation. While the film may divide critics, its exploration of grief, maternal love, and resilience has clearly struck a chord with audiences, cementing Sydney Sweeney's place as one of Hollywood's most compelling young talents."

tw_sl_388cb72dc4d3b3891a863d7f2d2c23ce,2025-06-15 17:02:02,en,WEB,"  Wes Anderson's latest movie The Phoenician Scheme is a very familiar outing for the acclaimed director, putting his gorgeous visual style to use in another witty, charming story with a huge ensemble cast. Thankfully, The Phoenician Scheme is now available to watch in theaters, but the director has already begun working on more projects for the near future. The cast members typically make or break an Anderson movie, and it's usually made. He's collaborated with some of comedy's most recognizable faces throughout his career, with figures like Bill Murray and Owen Wilson appearing in several of his movies. However in recent years, the director has broadened his choices and invited several new faces to the exclusive club. Anderson's unique visual style attracts a very specific kind of comedic actor, and several faces would fit perfectly into this cinematic world. 10 Rainn Wilson Best Known For The Office & Super Anderson is known for a very specific, quirky brand of comedy throughout his filmography that feels very similar to Rainn Wilson's work as Dwight Schrute in The Office. It's a very dry, awkward sense of humor that's reminiscent of actors like Richard Ayoade and Michael Cera, both of whom were praised for their performances in The Phoenician Scheme. Related 10 Actors Who Appear In Wes Anderson's Movies The Most, Ranked By Appearance Count One of modern cinema's most inimitable filmmakers, Anderson is renowned for his frequent collaborations with several prominent Hollywood big-hitters. Wilson has appeared in several movies and television shows since his time on The Office, but none of them have quite achieved the same level of success. Working on an Anderson movie comes with a certain expectation of acclaim and popularity, so this could be the perfect combination to bring Wilson back into the public eye while providing the filmmaker with another sharp, reliable cast member. 9 Sam Rockwell Best Known For Jojo Rabbit & Moon Sam Rockwell has appeared in several dramatic roles throughout his career, but the actor is undeniably at his best when dabbling in sillier, more comedic roles. This is evident from his work on projects such as Jojo Rabbit and Seven Psychopaths. In both movies, Rockwell was the standout member of an otherwise very talented ensemble. There's something about Rockwell's specific brand of comedy that feels like a natural fit for Anderson's cinematic world; he's dry and sarcastic, but he's also capable of tuning into a sillier, more slapstick side whenever necessary. 8 Aubrey Plaza Best Known For Parks & Recreation & The White Lotus Aubrey Plaza is well-known for her sarcastic delivery and deadpan sense of humor, which Anderson has capitalized on in his previous movies. Some of Anderson's best movies combine silly, larger-than-life performances with quieter, understated comedic roles to achieve a very aesthetic balance of tones and atmospheres, which Plaza could definitely contribute to. With icons like Bill Murray and Tom Hanks appearing in several of Anderson's movies, it's clear that the director enjoys working with experienced comedians on his projects. Plaza has been in the comedy business for years, so this feels like an inevitable collaboration. 7 Walton Goggins Best Known For Fallout & The White Lotus Walton Goggins is another actor who's brilliant at carefully walking the line between drama and comedy, as proven by his recent performance in The White Lotus. The actor has been having somewhat of a career renaissance in recent years, making potential collaborations with acclaimed filmmakers like Anderson even more likely. Goggins has also proved on several occasions that he thrives in ensemble projects, with The White Lotus serving as the most recent evidence of this. Anderson's movies typically have huge casts, so this feels like somewhere the actor would definitely be at home. 6 Zooey Deschanel Best Known For New Girl & 500 Days Of Summer The best episodes of New Girl have already proven that Zooey Deschanel is a comedic force to be reckoned with, but Anderson's projects require a very different kind of humor that would be fascinating to see the actor take on. Her performances in studio comedies like Yes Man and 500 Days of Summer have touched on this side of her personality before, but the actor has never fully leaned into the eccentric, awkward comedy that Anderson does so well. Related The Phoenician Scheme Review: Wes Anderson's Thriller Falls Flat Despite A Captivating Lead Performance From Mia Threapleton The Phoenician Scheme is a zany but hollow thriller with a breakout performance from its central star Mia Threapleton. While there are certain actors whom audiences can immediately picture in the world of Anderson (most recently, Michael Cera), there's something very exciting about watching the filmmaker discover this side of an otherwise established comedic talent. Deschanel feels like a perfect candidate for this treatment. 5 Adam Driver Best Known For Marriage Story & House Of Gucci Something else that Anderson does brilliantly is employing dramatic actors and giving them a more lighthearted, comedic role that allows them to show an entirely different side of themselves to the audience. Adam Driver has proven before that he's got an excellent sense of humor (Inside Llewyn Davis is a prime example), but he's never had the opportunity to fully lean into this side of acting. Ralph Fiennes in The Grand Budapest Hotel is probably the most obvious example, and it's often lauded as the strongest performance in Anderson's filmography. Adam Driver has proven before that he's got an excellent sense of humor (Inside Llewyn Davis is a prime example), but he's never had the opportunity to fully lean into this side of acting. Anderson could finally give him that chance. 4 Nicolas Cage..."

His departure marks a surprising pivot from the automotive to luxury fashion world. In a surprising announcement that sent ripples through the global automotive industry, Luca de Meo, the Italian executive credited with revitalising Renault Group, has confirmed he will step down as CEO on 15 July 2025. After five transformative years at the helm of the French carmaker, de Meo has chosen to ""pursue new challenges outside the automotive sector"", Renault said in a company statement. The news was officially announced by Renault on Monday, with French newspaper Le Figaro and the Financial Times both reporting that de Meo is set to become the new Chief Executive Officer of Kering, the French luxury conglomerate behind iconic fashion brands such as Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent. De Meo's sudden move represents a dramatic career pivot from engineering and mobility to high-end fashion and luxury retail. While Renault offered no confirmation regarding his next post, the reports in Le Figaro and the Financial Times suggest that de Meo will soon lead one of France's most influential holding companies in the global luxury space. In his parting message, de Meo said: ""There comes a time in one's life when one knows the job is done. The results speak for themselves: they are the best in our history."" He added: ""We have a strong team and an agile organisation. We also have a strategic plan ready for the next generation of products. That is why I have decided it is time for me to hand over the baton."" De Meo joined Renault from Seat-Cupra in 2020, taking on the CEO role amid intense financial pressure and operational complexity. He swiftly launched the ambitious Renaulution plan, a long-term business strategy designed to overhaul the group's portfolio, focus on profitability, and embrace the transition to electric mobility. Key elements of that plan included: The electrification of the Renault 5, turning the classic model into a compact EV; The launch of a new generation of SUVs aimed at both global and regional markets; The strategic repositioning of Alpine as a high-performance electric brand. Under de Meo's leadership, Renault saw a strong financial recovery, shedding legacy inefficiencies and re-establishing its competitiveness in the global EV race. His efforts were recognised earlier this year when he won the top Issigonis Trophy at the 2024 Autocar Awards. Despite the flattering tributes from Renault's leadership, de Meo's exit comes as a shock to industry observers. His name had previously been floated for the CEO role at Stellantis, which was ultimately filled by Antonio Filosa, but de Meo had denied any plans to leave Renault, insisting he ""still had a job to do."" That context makes Monday's announcement even more surprising. Renault Group chairman Jean-Dominique Senard praised de Meo's contributions, calling him ""an exceptional captain of industry"" and adding: ""The entire company joins me in thanking him for all these years and all the collective challenges successfully met."" Renault confirmed that it has activated an existing succession plan and is now actively seeking a replacement. Until then, de Meo will remain in his position, overseeing a seamless transition as the group prepares for its next phase of innovation and market competitiveness. As well as leading Renault, de Meo has also played a key industry role in recent years as president of ACEA, the European Automobile Manufacturers' Association. There, he became a prominent advocate for supporting European-made small city cars to rival cheaper Chinese imports. De Meo's expected move to Kering suggests a desire to apply his leadership skills in a completely different arena—managing creativity, brand equity, and global retail experiences instead of vehicle platforms and powertrains. While unconfirmed by Kering at the time of writing, his appointment would mark a rare crossover between the automotive and fashion sectors. His departure leaves behind a Renault that is vastly different from the one he inherited—leaner, more agile, and better positioned to navigate the high-stakes evolution of the mobility industry.

my14lod,2025-06-16 05:01:54,en,REDDIT,"  I'm another daily, rx user. I own two pairs so I can listen to audiobooks all day, use live translation as needed and use the AI features liberally without having any battery anxiety (the one major downside of these IMO) I also went with the relensing from Lensology. I'm happy with the lenses. They don't have the rayban logo on the lens, but I really don't care about that. Supposedly RayBan optics are high end but like... they aren't Zeiss. Anyways, as for my lenses I went with Xtra Active (works in the car) with polarization and their premium coating. I believe they are blue light blocking but I actually just ordered some specific blue light blocking lenses from 39dollarglasses to swap in to some old Gucci wire frames I had laying around because I wanted something lighter with a wider FOV for working at my computer. No, not dorky. I have been waiting for a major fashion brand to finally get in on the smart glasses market because I'm absolutely never going to wear something that looks like tech on my face. Wayfarers are a classic design, nearly a century old. They've always looked good. ANd they still do. Meta successfully squeezed all their tech in to the original design envelope, and as someone else mentioned, most people don't notice. As for jetskiing? I'm gonna go with that's a hard no. I got anxious giving my horses a bath and that's just like, a light mist blowing back in my face. I went ahead and got some old sunglasses relensed for splashy activities, just to be safe. I don't believe Costco carries them, no. I got both my pairs on sale from Amazon for around $250 each. After the relensing they were just under 500 per pair. All in all I have to say, I love them (I mean, I went back for seconds, that should tell you everything you need to know). I will never not own smart glasses now that the tech has finally reached this threshold and they are also being made with designer brands. They are expensive-ish, and not everyone uses them heavily, so they don't really see the value sometimes. But if you listen to a lot of podcasts/audiobooks, or maybe just take a lot of calls they are fantastic (not as great for music, but passable I suppose). For me the camera is a nice bonus, but it wasn't the main draw, so I don't really mind the 3 minute time limit on videos. I do like being able to snap a quick picture of whatever I'm looking at without having to pull out my phone. They are great for candid shots. I guess just consider how you think you will use the features that are available and look at what your other options are that might better fit your needs (for example a  gopro and a waterproof Bluetooth speaker) and see if the value proposition makes sense to you."

Renault ADRs closed 2.5% lower at $9.83 on Friday. The company said de Meo is leaving to pursue new opportunities outside the automotive sector. It also confirmed that a formal process is underway to appoint a new Chief Executive Officer, based on an existing succession plan. Kering reportedly plans to appoint De Meo as chief executive while he manages its portfolio companies, including Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, and Balenciaga. Under De Meo's leadership, Renault managed to lower expenses and improve operational efficiency while transforming its relationship with Nissan. Renault benefited from his assistance in pushing for hybrid vehicle development and accelerating its shift towards electric vehicles. Separately, Nissan Motor plans to reduce its stake in Renault, according to comments by CEO Ivan Espinosa reported by Nikkei. Nissan may sell its entire 5% holding, potentially raising about 100 billion yen ($640 million), which it intends to use for new vehicle development amid challenging conditions. Renault ADRs have gained 2.8% so far this year. For updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com. MENAFN16062025007385015968ID1109677932"

Lo ha comunicato ieri l'azienda, mentre il quotidiano Le Figaro ha scritto che de Meo diventerà il nuovo Ceo di Kering. De Meo ha risollevato le sorti della travagliata casa automobilistica francese nei cinque anni in cui è stato alla guida, riorganizzandone la ventennale alleanza strategica con Nissan e raddoppiando i motori ibridi per una transizione verso l'elettrico. De Meo sostituirà Francois-Henri Pinault, la cui famiglia controlla il conglomerato del lusso francese, pesantemente indebitato, e che lo ha guidato per 20 anni, secondo Le Figaro. Nessun commento da Kering su quanto scritto dal giornale. ""Luca de Meo ha espresso la decisione di dimettersi per affrontare nuove sfide al di fuori del settore automobilistico"", si legge in un comunicato di Renault. De Meo lascerà Renault a metà luglio, prosegue la nota. Lo Stato francese detiene una partecipazione del 15% nell'azienda. Se confermato, il passaggio di de Meo a Kering, che ultimamente non è riuscita a convincere gli investitori dei piani di rilancio del marchio Gucci, segnerebbe un cambiamento radicale nel gruppo. Pinault manterrebbe il proprio ruolo di presidente di Kering. (Tradotto da Jasmine Mazzarello, editing Sabina Suzzi)"

As the adage goes, there are decades where nothing happens, and there are weeks where decades happen — and we're unmistakably in one of those weeks. Leading the issue today is coverage of the impact of Israel's war with Iran on Egypt, news that the IMF may be a bit more lenient in our fifth review, the activation of the EU's EUR 1.8 bn investment guarantee mechanism, and more. We've got a packed issue today, so let's jump right in.

In our weekly vertical exploring all things industry and manufacturing, we looked at how smart packaging and sustainability have become Egypt's gateway to global markets. Check out the story here. HAPPENING TODAY- It's day two of International Finance Corporation (IFC) President Makhtar Diop's two-day trip to Egypt, during which he will continue to “advance [the corporation's] mission: mobilize capital, create jobs, and deliver impact,” alongside newly appointed Vice President for Africa Ethiopis Tafara and their accompanying delegation. Diop and Tafara were kept plenty busy on day one yesterday, having met with President Abdel Fattah El Sisi and Planning Minister Rania Al Mashat for a meeting centered around efforts to boost investment prospects and funding for private players. El Sisi also highlighted efforts to boost the private sector's involvement in the local economy. But day two could be even more eventful, with the IFC to release a strategy for offering local airports development to private players through public-private partnerships (PPPs) “soon,” Diop said during a meeting with Prime Minister Moustafa Madbouly. The first of the program's tenders will launch before the end of the year, Madbouly said during the meeting. REMEMBER- The IFC unveiled a list of 11 Egyptian airports slated for development through PPPs in March. Hurghada International Airport will serve as a pilot project for the program. The IFC will help the government launch a tender to select a strategic private partner for maintaining, operating, and upgrading the airport. DATA POINT- Egypt has mobilized USD 15.6 bn in concessional development finance for the private sector since 2020 — but bridging the country's development finance gap will require nothing short of a shakeup in the global financial system, the Planning and International Cooperation Ministry argues in its latest report (pdf), unveiled yesterday by Minister Rania Al Mashat at the Development Finance to Foster Private Sector-Led Growth and Jobs conference. The event took place in the presence of senior officials from some of our development partners. ** It's a hefty 52-page report that dives into all things development finance.

The event will dive into how “businesses are navigating economic turbulence while driving innovation, exports and sustainable industrial growth,” according to a statement (pdf). Panels will include insights from leading private sector players, including Travco General Manager Moataz Sedky, Edita CEO Alfred Younan, Talabat Egypt Managing Director Hadeer Shalaby — to name but a few, according to the event's agenda (pdf). CORRECTION- We incorrectly reported that the event will be held on Thursday in yesterday's issue. We have since amended the story on our website. THE BIG STORY ABROAD- Once again, the international press is zeroing in our part of the world as Israel's war with Iran enters its fourth day, with reports coming out overnight about the US vetoing Israeli plans to kill Iran's supreme leader and continuing strikes that have now pushed the death toll to at least 244 in Iran and 10 in Israel. US President Donald Trump allegedly vetoed Israel's plan to kill Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, which it presented to the US in recent days amid the ongoing escalations between Iran and Israel. The Trump administration reportedly rejected the plan as it saw it as “as a move that would enflame the conflict and potentially destabilize the region,” an unnamed US official said. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in response to the news seemed to refuse to put regime change off the table, telling Fox News that “we do what we need to do.” (Associated Press | Reuters | Financial Times | Guardian | New York Times) The war is also expected to top the agenda of the G7 Leaders Summit kicking off in Canada. Differences between the US and the six other nations over trade tariffs and Russia's war on Ukraine are also being painted as potential flashpoints.

According to sources, current Kering chief Francois-Henri Pinault, whose family controls the heavily indebted luxury conglomerate and who has been leading it for 20 years, is mulling splitting the roles of CEO and chairman. The following is a timeline of the major events in the French luxury fashion group's history. 1962 - Francois Pinault founds Etablissements Pinault, a timber trading company based in Rennes that will transform into Kering. March 1999 - The firm, now called PPR, begins its transformation into a luxury group by acquiring a 42% stake in the fashion group Gucci for about $3 billion. July 2001 - The group buys the Balenciaga fashion house, which soon becomes a celebrities-favoured strategic brand within the PPR-owned Gucci Group. March 2005 - Francois-Henri Pinault, the founder's son, replaces Serge Weinberg as chairman and CEO of the group and begins to sell off non-core activities to fund further acquisition in the fashion sector. November 2011 - The group announces the acquisition of Italian luxury house Brioni, famous for designing James Bond's suits, in a bid to strengthen its high-end menswear profile. December 2012 - The conglomerate makes its first-ever acquisition in China by purchasing a majority stake in fine jewellery company Qeelin. March 2013 - The firm changes its name to Kering to herald its exit from mass market retail brands. April 2013 - The firm takes over jewellery brands including Italy's Pomellato and DoDo. July 2023 - Kering buys a 30% stake in Italian fashion brand Valentino for 1.7 billion euros ($1.97 billion) in an attempt to revitalise struggling Gucci, which is wrestling with a fading post-pandemic fashion boom. October 2024 - The firm highlights major headwinds to profits at Gucci, hampered by weak demand in China. April 2025 - The group finds itself in dire straits as its most recent results show a deepening crisis at its flagship Gucci label.

We would view positively the appointment of an outsider, and Luca de Meo could be the right profile to drive the turnaround.

JP MORGAN ""Investors were this year focused on the announcement of Renault's mid-term plan. With the CEO stepping down, this will naturally provide a setback.

BERNSTEIN ""Brand management and marketing are his forte, which dovetails with what the luxury industry does - for which he seems passionate.

CITI ""Execution of luxury brand turnarounds has become more complex, lengthy, costly and far less public market-friendly, reflecting consumer preference for top brands rather than those in transition. ""We believe it's premature to adopt a more positive stance given the lack of visibility on Gucci's turnaround.""

""His departure may hurt early lobbying (joint with Stellantis) to revive an affordable small car segment in Europe.

mov_A6FC18A3B4C40F71D35B0051D21449F8,2025-06-16 08:23:58,en,WEB,"  What's going on here? Luca de Meo is stepping down as CEO of Renault and may soon join luxury titan Kering, owner of Gucci. What does this mean? Luca de Meo's potential move to Kering has caught analysts' attention. Kepler Cheuvreux is optimistic, pointing to his expertise in revamping brands, even though he's new to the luxury sector. Meanwhile, JP Morgan sees de Meo's departure as a challenge for Renault's strategic ambitions but notes strong internal candidates ready to step up, especially those from Dacia. Bernstein praises de Meo's decisive leadership at Renault, which could translate well into luxury markets. However, Citi warns of the intricate task of turning around a giant like Gucci, suggesting investors stay cautious due to the uncertain path ahead. Why should I care? For markets: Navigating strategic seas. Renault might face steering challenges without de Meo, especially during key strategic discussions. Jefferies highlights potential influences from Geely and the French state, while the search for his successor may involve strong internal leaders and fresh faces from Stellantis. The bigger picture: Luxury's new knight in shining armor. De Meo's move could invigorate Kering, drawing from his proven brand management skills.

Con apenas diez días de diferencia dejaron sus puestos el CEO de Renault Latinoamérica, el brasileño Luiz Fernando Pedrucci, y el CEO global de Renault Group, el italiano Luca De Meo. Los dos directivos fueron clave en las últimas medidas adoptadas por la marca del Rombo en la Argentina. Pedrucci aprobó la inversión de 350 millones de dólares para producir la pick-up derivada de la Renault Niágara Concept en la Fábrica Santa Isabel (ver nota), mientras que De Meo se puso al frente de las negociaciones para que el piloto argentino Franco Colapinto desembarcara en la escudería Alpine de Fórmula 1 (leer más). La abrupta salida de los dos ejecutivos deja abierta la incógnita acerca de lo que ocurrirá en el futuro con la estrategia de la empresa. Desde Renault Argentina no se hicieron comentarios oficiales acerca de la renuncia de estos directivos. Al momento de publicarse esta nota, la filial local ni siquiera se había hecho eco de los comunicados que se difundieron sobre estas dos renuncias en Francia, Brasil, España y otras sedes del Rombo. Por el momento, Renault Group no informó quiénes reemplazarán a estos dos ejecutivos. En el marco de una restructuración gerencial de la empresa, es probable que el cargo que ocupaba Pedrucci desaparezca por completo. Con respecto a De Meo, su salida fue sorpresiva. La casa matriz se limitó a informar anoche que el Directorio de Renault Group ""inició el proceso para designar a un nuevo CEO, basados en un plan de sucesión ya definido"". Si bien Pedrucci no brindó pistas en su mensaje de despedida acerca de su futuro profesional (ver completo abajo), el caso de Luca De Meo fue diferente: el ex CEO de Renault Group protagonizó semanas atrás un debate público (recordemos que el Estado de Francia tiene participación accionaria en la empresa) donde tuvo que justificar su salario anual de 5.5 millones de euros. También se rechazó su propuesta de aumentar los sueldos a toda la plantilla de la empresa. Pero De Meo ya encontró un nuevo trabajo. Al mismo tiempo que ayer se confirmaba su salida de Renault Group, el Grupo Kering anunció la incorporación de De Meo a la cúpula de la empresa: se trata de la firma de bienes de consumo de lujo, que tiene en su portafolio a marcas de prestigio como Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent, Balenciaga y Puma, entre muchas otras. Los dos ex ejecutivos de Renault fueron líderes personalistas. El brasileño Pedrucci no dudaba a la hora de desautorizar en público a sus subordinados: quería tener el control y recibir el mérito absoluto por las principales decisiones y anuncios de la empresa. El italiano De Meo, por su parte, trabajó para convertirse en una figura pública con alto perfil de exposición en los medios. En sus últimas semanas al frente de Renault, De Meo estrenó su propia película documental donde contó la historia de su estrategia comercial ""Renaulution"" (leer más). Además, había lanzado a la venta su propio libro autobiogfráfico, donde relata su relación personal con el mundo de los autos: ""Diccionario sentimental del automóvil"" (leer más). La crisis gerencial de Renault recién empieza. El directorio del Rombo tiene ahora el desafío de ver cómo cubre los puestos vacantes o si aprovecha estas salidas para encarar una restructuración más profunda de la compañía. Hay más información en los comunicados de despedida de los dos ejecutivos, acá abajo. C.C. ""Tras 5 años al frente del Grupo Renault, Luca de Meo ha anunciado su decisión de dimitir y emprender nuevos retos fuera del sector de la automoción. El Consejo de Administración, convocado por su presidente, Jean-Dominique Senard, expresó su agradecimiento a Luca de Meo por la transformación del Grupo Renault y acordó que su salida se hará efectiva a partir del 15 de julio de 2025. Luca de Meo continuará desempeñando sus funciones hasta esa fecha. El Consejo de Administración ha iniciado el proceso de nombramiento de un nuevo Director General, basándose en el plan de sucesión ya definido. El Consejo de Administración ha expresado su confianza en la calidad y la experiencia del equipo directivo para continuar y acelerar la estrategia de transformación del Grupo Renault en esta nueva etapa"". ""Hoy cierro un ciclo. Un ciclo largo, intenso y feliz. Me incorporé a Renault en 1997 como becario. La empresa llegó a Brasil y yo iniciaba mi vida profesional. Crecimos juntos. Aprendí. Cometí errores. Me atreví. Siempre creí en lo que podíamos construir. Durante casi tres décadas, viví en diferentes países, dirigí equipos, enfrenté crisis y celebré muchas victorias. Trabajé en ventas, posventa, marketing, producto y cadena de suministro. Me enorgullecía ser presidente de Renault en mi querida e inolvidable Colombia. Veinte años después de empezar como becario, asumí el cargo de primer presidente brasileño de Renault do Brasil. Dos años después, me convertí en el primer presidente latinoamericano de Renault Latinoamérica. Hemos vivido años intensos. Hemos superado grandes retos. Hemos alcanzado logros tangibles. Recientemente, aprobamos el plan de inversiones para los próximos años. Hemos comenzado la fase de renovación. Hoy, me voy de Renault orgulloso de lo que hemos logrado juntos...."
mov_0E889DD13C3284607656D56CB6EA098E,2025-06-16 10:07:00,en,WEB,"  Plus three other food-inspired colour trends we're excited about Last week, I picked up the first delivery of my CSA (community supported agriculture) farm box, a collection of fresh fruits and veggies I'll be receiving every other week for the next few months. This first one was flush with lettuce, deep-green kale, bright spinach, and pure-white spring-onion bulbs. It got me thinking about colour in the context of what we eat—and how nature offers inspiration beyond the kitchen. Something as simple as a peach or summer salad can inspire the way I put an outfit together—a way to embrace the wide range of hues the season has to offer. This also reminded me of Werner's Nomenclature of Colours, a book I recently learned about, which back in 1821 identified the different shades of colour in nature, from saffron yellow to apple green. (The book was even used by Charles Darwin in his research.) So, while Pantone may proclaim that 2025 is the year of “mocha mousse,” our predilection for connecting colours and food goes back much further. The trend cycle may shift and change over time from quiet luxury to bold expressionism, but a curiosity for colours and how they can be combined and contrasted remains. Ahead, I selected four of the season's most delicious combinations from the runways to inspire your own style. High-saturation colour combos are a statement move, whether you're walking into the office or sitting down on a first date. A ripe-tomato red paired with a rich, deep purple makes for an unexpected duo, which is part of what makes the two so dynamic when worn together. They command attention in a way that's fun and lighthearted and strong enough to hold their own with piled-on accessories, from jewellery to belts. Pistachio is the word in everyone's mouth this season, in part thanks to the viral Dubai-chocolate trend, but also because the rich green colour has popped up in several collections, from Gucci and Prada to Chanel and Dries van Noten. While styling it with neutral tones is an easy way to embrace the trend, consider taking things up a notch with a pop of clementine. The result is a fun and playful colour combination (and the ingredients make for a delicious dessert too). For those whose aesthetic leans toward neutrals, a slight step out of the comfort zone comes by way of soft and buttery yellow styled with a steely grey sardine. Butter yellow is one of the year's hottest colours, spotted on the runways across fashion month, from Auralee to Marni to Toteme. But while grey may not seem like a typical summer shade, its subtle touch when paired with a soft yellow hue is one that will transition your look easily into autumn. Sweet raspberry paired with a crunchy Biscoff cookie makes for a delicious treat, but it also creates a delightful colour combo for summer. Instead of bright and vivid Barbie pink, we prefer leaning into a deeper, lush shade of raspberry this season when balanced by a soft shade of cocoa brown."

mov_C46EFCB5BB39BB1D09FFE495A10C4CEA,2025-06-16 11:03:40,en,WEB,"  Amid the tragedy of the Israel-Iran conflict, stocks are proving stoic. Futures early Monday, as the missile attacks continued, showed the S&P 500 once again reclaiming the 6,000 mark. That's only about 2% shy of the record high struck in February. However, there are three possible ways that the Middle East conflagration may still negatively effect the equity market, according to Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy research at RBC Capital Markets. The first concern is an adverse impact that the Israel-Iran escalation could have on the multiples that investors are prepared to apply to stocks, says Calvasina in a note published late Sunday. “Similar to what we see with economic policy uncertainty, when national security policy uncertainty rises, P/Es for the S&P 500 have tended to contract,” she says. P/Es refers to the share price to earnings multiples of a stock, or price-to-earnings. Calvasina reckons this factor is particularly important now because the S&P 500's P/E multiples didn't even get cheap during the tariff-induced market tantrum of March and April, and have quickly retuned to levels that are well above long-term averages. Consequently, the fresh Middle East conflict “comes at a time when stocks should be vulnerable to bad news from a valuation perspective,” she says. The second issue is the damage the heightened geopolitical tension may wreak upon investor, consumer and business sentiment — which have been showing signs of healing recently after the trade war scare. According to Calvasina: “These inflections in sentiment, which have been stronger on the investor side than the consumer and small business side, have been a key driver of the recent rally in stocks.” For example, nascent optimism about initial public offerings, and mergers and acquisitions, could falter if market volatility spikes. And Calvasina notes that corporate transcripts have shown in the past how other events like the Los Angeles fires, bad weather and the flu are said to impact consumer behavior, and she thinks it's likely investors will be reading about the Middle East tension in future earnings calls. The final factor is the impact rising oil prices may have on inflationary pressures. RBC's commodity strategists see further significant upside for Brent crude the international benchmark, if a material disruption to oil supply occurs in the Middle East. This could muddle the Federal Reserve's inflation outlook, a problem for stocks given one support for the market has been expectations of rate cuts later in the year and into 2026. Indeed, RBC's valuation model suggests that higher headline inflation would be a drag on P/E multiples. The bank's newest valuation stress test took personal consumption expenditure price index inflation (the Fed's favored measure) up to 4%, applied just two 25 basis point Fed rate cuts for the rest of 2025, and assumed 10-year Treasury yields were around current levels, just below 4.45%, until the end of the year. “[D]epending on what EPS is used, this stress test points to fair value for the S&P 500 at the end of 2025 in the 4,800-5,200 range, near the bottom of our 2nd tier of fear and a retest of the early-2025 lows,” says Calvasina. The S&P 500 closed Friday at 5,977. Markets U.S. stock-index futures are higher as benchmark Treasury yields rise. The dollar index is lower, while oil prices slip back and gold is trading around $3,413 an ounce.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) rose 0.6%, while the S&P 500 (^GSPC) moved up 0.6%. The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) gained 0.8%. The cautious optimism follows a bruising Friday session that saw the Dow plunge more than 700 points in a broad risk-off move. Meanwhile, oil (CL=F) prices edged lower after jumping in the wake of the latest attacks, having surged last week to their highest levels since January. The geopolitical flare-up comes at a delicate moment for markets already buffeted by tariff insecurity. Friday's selloff dragged the major US indexes into negative territory for the week. Now investors are regaining some appetite for risk amid rising optimism that the conflict won't spill over into a broader regional crisis. President Trump said on Sunday there's a ""good chance"" of an Israel-Iran peace deal, but the hostilities may need to play out first. “Sometimes they have to fight it out, but we're going to see what happens,” he told reporters. A measure of calm is also returning to the oil market, rattled by fears of disruption to the global energy supply. After spiking initially, prices pushed down well over 1% to pull Brent crude (BZ=F) toward $73 a barrel and WTI crude to below $72 a barrel. Gold (GC=F) prices also pulled back, having rallied alongside oil as it drew safe-haven flows amid rising volatility. The precious metal traded lower at around $3,440 an ounce. On the trade front, the EU is reportedly ready to accept US tariffs of 10% across all its exports — the baseline for Trump's ""reciprocal"" hikes — as the president puts pressure on trading partners to reach a deal. The offer is a bid to avert higher rates on cars, drugs, and electronics, Handelsblatt reported. Looking ahead, markets overwhelmingly expect the Fed to hold rates steady on Wednesday. While President Trump has maintained pressure on Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates, current market dynamics may leave little room to budge.

mov_383BF0D3AB6A19EC27945D421C820F79,2025-06-16 15:10:20,en,WEB,"  By Tassilo Hummel and Lisa Jucca (Reuters) -Francois-Henri Pinault's reported decision to hire Renault boss Luca de Meo is an audacious but necessary move to address the twin challenge of sagging sales and mounting debt at luxury group Kering, investors and industry players say. De Meo's turnaround credentials were enhanced by his work at French carmaker Renault, but he has much to do if he is to replicate the successes of cross-sector heavyweights such as Robert Polet and Leena Nair. Pinault, son of founder Francois and CEO of Paris-listed Kering since 2005, has struggled to contain a deepening rot at star brand Gucci while embarking on a shopping spree that has stretched the French conglomerate's balance sheet and that of controlling family holding Artemis. By stepping aside to let de Meo run a luxury sector giant, Pinault has acknowledged the urgent need to address Kering's problems, including the 75% drop in its value since the summer of 2021, according to Reuters conversations with industry experts and investors. ""It's a bold move ... We now have a CEO (de Meo) who is a great professional,"" said Ariane Hayate, European equity fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild. ""There's now a real willingness by Francois-Henri Pinault to take a step back after years of underperformance."" Kering's share price rose by more than 12% on Monday, on track for its best daily performance since 2008. The group's expected swoop for de Meo also suggests that its problems are bigger than perceived from the outside and go beyond Gucci, said one large European investor on condition of anonymity in discussions relating to individual investments. Despite his lack of experience in the luxury sector, de Meo does bring skills that can help Kering at this critical juncture, industry players say. Having successfully managed a turnaround at Renault, he is likely to accelerate a Kering cost-cutting push that includes store closures, real estate sales and redundancies to reduce its more than 10 billion euros ($11.6 billion) of net debt, according to two industry players and one person who knows him. De Meo will also need to address Kering's planned acquisition of the 70% of fashion brand Valentino that it doesn't already own. Kering bought 30% in 2023 for $1.9 billion and intends to buy the remainder in 2028. The purchase from Qatari-backed luxury fund Mayhoola could cost a further 4 billion euros, Kering's annual report said. Options included in the original deal might force Kering to buy the other 70% as early as next May, company filings show, which could require partial payment in Kering shares, Kering finance chief Armelle Poulou said in April. ""Coming from outside the industry, de Meo's learning curve is going to be super steep, but at the negotiating table he could do well,"" said one person familiar with Valentino, declining to be named owing to the sensitivity of the matter. Mayhoola, which does not have a press office, did not respond to a request for comment sent to its corporate email address. A person close to the fund described de Meo's expected arrival at Kering as good news. TOP CHALLENGE De Meo's most pressing challenge, however, is Gucci. The Italian label has struggled since star designer Alessandro Michele left in late 2022 and the company's recent appointment of creative director Demna from Balenciaga disappointed investors. Coming with three decades of automaking experience, de Meo may initially focus on costs, said a Kering adviser who declined to be named, while luxury sector adviser Mario Ortelli said it could be difficult for de Meo to come from a different industry and give an opinion on a creative designer. But the aforementioned cross-sector successes of Polet, Nair, Vigna and Marchionne offer hope for de Meo. Polet, who joined Gucci as CEO in 2004 after a 26-year career at Unilever, is credited with reviving the label after the departure of famed designer Tom Ford. Nair switched from Unilever to Chanel in 2022 and lifted sales to $18.7 billion in 2024 from $15.6 billion in 2021. Other cross-sector success included Ferrari boss Benedetto Vigna, who joined the supercar manufacturer from chipmaker STMicro in 2021 and led a push towards highly profitable personalised offers to clients. Another was the late Sergio Marchionne, architect of the successful Fiat-Chrysler merger and a former boss of de Meo, who joined Fiat from verification company SGS.

mov_AE16CF9957B50A4EF7FA00BB9D7DEBC8,2025-06-16 15:10:51,en,WEB,"  Lies of P might have been seen as a Soulsborne clone, but with its redemption arc, the story is flipping. The narrative arrived due to similar game mechanics Round 8 Studios used, which had been implemented by FromSoftware beforehand. But again, the features are as detailed as FromSoft's presentations, which gives it a pass. One such feature that has been implemented in Lies of P is the emotes. The same kind can be seen in FromSoft games. But did you know those emotes can trigger specific effects? That's right, you can do the same in Lies of P as well, and the 'Play Dead' emotes have some hilarious effects. Lies of P players have found out the right use for the 'Play Dead' emote Who knew emotions in games could help you avoid problems? | Image Credit: NEOWIZ Lies of P may have taken a lot of inspiration from Soulsborne games to shed light on its own world. We are all aware of the difficult bosses and the git-gud energy of the game, but there are more interesting mechanics. While emotes can be used as a way to express yourself in the game, they also have consequences. The consequences may not be drastic, but a fun way to interact within the game. In Lies of P, the 'Play Dead' emote is probably one of the most fun ones as it can serve as an escape from a perilous situation. It is usually comical, but hey, as long as it works, we gucci. The r/LiesofP has been sparked by the newfound discovery, and players are sharing their bizarre experiences with it. On the subreddit, u/Underdose35 showcased that you can skip Gemini's tour speech by using the emote. Sending the message straight that Pinocchio is tired of it, and it's killing him mentally. A bit rude way to convey that, but that's the only way to make him stop rambling about. If you play dead during Gemini's tour guide speech, he takes the hint and stops talking. byu/Underdose35 inLiesOfP In case nobody has tried, this emote actually works byu/poopoobuttholes inLiesOfP You can also use the 'Play Dead' emote in goofy ways, thanks to another user; fans got to observe that. If you're about to get mauled by an angry bear, you can simply play dead. Of course, it won't work if you trigger the emote while it's doing an attack. By successfully doing it, you can avoid bear paw slaps. A friendly survival tip that would take you quite far. What do fans think of these tiny easter eggs? ⛶ ⛶ ⛶ ⛶ ⛶ While the emote interactions in single-player games aren't a new concept, fans are baffled by the level of detail Lies of P has. If you didn't know in FromSoft's Soulsborne has the same level of detail with its emotes. For example, in Dark Souls 3, you can wave to the Firekeeper, and she would bow in response. In Lies of P, it might be subtle, but it works similarly. Comment byu/Underdose35 from discussion inLiesOfP Comment byu/poopoobuttholes from discussion inLiesOfP The 'Play Dead' emote is a very silly one, but fans love that. For a game that's serious with its story, the emotes kind of lighten the situations. However, some have pointed out that Gemini's tour speech can be interrupted with any emote, so it might be intentional. But again, there's no denying, the emote works against bears. The friend-shaped creatures are merciful to the dead, so you might find yourself making close escapes...."

Meanwhile, Renault shares dropped around 7%their steepest slide in almost a yearas investors digested the surprise exit of the executive credited with stabilizing the automaker post-pandemic. De Meo, who joined Renault in 2020 from Volkswagen, led a successful cost-cutting overhaul, slashed global capacity, and reworked the company's strained alliance with Nissan. Now, he's walking away in mid-July for what he calls a new transformation challenge in a completely different industry. His next stop? Sources say it's Kering. The move, if confirmed, would mark a rare crossover from automotive grit to luxury strategy. Analysts at Kepler Cheuvreux say De Meo's product obsession and brand-building instincts could bring exactly the kind of energy Kering needs. The group, controlled by the Pinault family, has struggled to reignite Gucci since the pandemic and is carrying more than 10 billion in debt. Investors appear to be welcoming the shake-up: this would be Kering's biggest single-day jump since March 2020. At Renault, the mood is less celebratory. While the company insists its upcoming mid-term strategy is intact, JP Morgan analysts flagged the departure as a potential setback. De Meo made clear this is a personal move, not an escape. Renault is well-positioned for the next chapter, he told staff in a note. Whether Kering becomes that next chapter could be officially confirmed as soon as Monday evening. Markets are already moving like it is. This article first appeared on GuruFocus."

I will of course be at his side to accompany him in this new phase, as Chairman of the Board of Kering.” Luca de Meo said: “I would like to thank François-Henri Pinault and the Board of Directors for choosing me to lead Kering into this new phase of development.

George'as Lucas pirmą kartą pasiūlė Haną Solo Pacino, vaidmenį, kuris galiausiai atiteko Harrisonui Fordui. Aktorius atskleidė, kad jam taip pat buvo duotas perskaityti scenarijus. Be to, Pacino už vaidmenį buvo pasiūlyta didelė pinigų suma, tačiau nepaisant gražaus sandorio, jis prisipažino negalintis to padaryti. Žvaigždžių karai pirmą kartą nufilmuotas į kosmosą tolimoje galaktikoje 1977 m., kuriame pagrindinius vaidmenis atliko Harrisonas Fordas, Carrie Fisher ir Markas Hamilas. Franšizė tapo žaidimo keitikliu ir popkultūros hitu, sukaupusią stiprią gerbėjų bazę iš viso pasaulio. SUSIJĘS : Al Pacino atmetė 1,15 mlrd. USD veiksmo kultinės klasikos franšizę, todėl Sylvester Stallone buvo priverstas vaidinti pagrindinį vaidmenį ir uždirbti 400 mln. Kodėl Krikštatėvis Al Pacino atsisakė Žvaigždžių karai Vaidmuo Al Pacino kalbėjo „The 92nd Street Y“, Niujorke, ir patvirtino, kad jis pirmasis gavo pasiūlymą Han Solo vaidmeniui, kuris atiteko Harisonas Fordas . Jis pasakė (per Įvairovė ): “ Na, aš atsisakiau „Žvaigždžių karų“. Kai pirmą kartą pasirodžiau, buvau naujas vaikas, žinai, kas nutinka, kai pirmą kartą išgarsėsi. Tai tarsi „Duok Alui“. Jie duos man žaisti karalienę Elžbietą. Jie man davė scenarijų pavadinimu „Žvaigždžių karai“. Jie man pasiūlė tiek pinigų. aš to nesuprantu. perskaičiau. Taigi pasakiau, kad negaliu to padaryti. Sudaviau Harrisonui Fordui karjerą . Iš tiesų, paleidus Žvaigždžių karai franšizė iškėlė Fordo karjerą į naujas aukštumas. Per tą laiką Pacino buvo paklausus aktorius, kuris ką tik vaidino dviese Krikštatėvis filmai. Buvo prasminga tik tai, kad jo norėjo daugelis režisierių, ypač Lucasas, kuris taip pat yra geras Franciso Fordo Coppolos, režisieriaus, draugas. Krikštatėvis filmai. Nėra įrašo, kiek pinigų Lucasfilmas pasiūlė Pacino. Remiantis pranešimais, Fordas gavo 10 000 USD po pirmojo Žvaigždžių karai filmas. Šiuo laikotarpiu Pacino buvo populiaresnis ir atliko didesnius vaidmenis nei Fordas, todėl jis būtų gavęs didesnį atlyginimą, jei tik būtų pasakęs „taip“ šiam darbui. Įdomu tai, kad Fordui buvo skirta 25 milijonai dolerių, kad jis galėtų pakartoti Haną Solo vaidmenį „Disney“ tęsinio trilogijoje – didžiulė suma, dėl kurios Pacino šiandien tikrai gailėtųsi. Nepaisant to, pastarasis teigia, kad Fordas jam skolingas už savo karjerą, nes Han Solo vaidmuo nušovė jį į žvaigždes ir po to aktorių paskatino dar daug projektų. SUSIJĘS : „Staiga tai tapo iššūkiu“: Keanu Reevesas tris kartus atsisakė Al Pacino, prieš tapdamas pasauliniu reiškiniu su „Matrix“ franšize Būsimuose Al Pacino projektuose yra Šekspyro pjesė ir memuarai Kadangi gyvenimą galima gyventi tik į priekį, Al Pacino juda iš atminties Žvaigždžių karai ir dabar dirba prie naujo projekto – adaptacijos karalius Lyras pagal garsiąją Williamo Shakespeare'o pjesę. Nepaisant to, kad prieš daugelį metų paskelbė apie pasitraukimą, jis ir toliau priima projektus ir vis dar planuoja ateityje dirbti su naujais dalykais. Naujausi jo darbai apima Gucci namas ir „Prime Video“. Medžiotojai . Aktorius taip pat rašo atsiminimus apie savo vaisingą karjerą. Jis lieka be pavadinimo ir bus parašytas kartu su bendraautoriu.

Una forma de mirar de frente al conflicto israeloiraní que sembraba de ventas los mercados el pasado viernes y que ahora, a decir de las compras de los inversores, se considera contenido. Este efecto, provoca la caída en más de un 4% del petróleo, el recorte del Vix, el índice del miedo, del oro, del activo refugio y del recorte de las rentabilidades de los bonos. Es más, las compras se imponen con mayor fuerza una vez que The Wall Street Journal ha señalado que Irán quiere sentarse a negociar y reducir las hostilidades con Israel. La consecuencia clara es las subidas generales y decididas de la renta variable, sostenida a lo largo de la sesión, en la que el IBEX 35 sube un 1,44% hasta los 14.110 puntos con las ganancias que encabezan valores como Grifols A 4,27%,Banco Santander 3,92% e IAG (Iberia) 3,09% y las caídas de Endesa 1,40%, Indra 1,16% y Cellnex 0,58%. Entre los protagonistas de la sesión, las ganancias de Grifols A liderando el mercado y superando los 10,6 euros por acción, niveles que ha superado al cierre por primera vez de más de tres meses. La razón estriba en la compra, al cierre del pasado viernes por parte de Tomás Daga, consejero de la compañía de hemoderivados, de 7,75 millones de euros en acciones de la compañía que representan el 0,17% de su capital. Tomás Dagá es accionista de Scranton Enterprises, una de las sociedades señaladas en el informe del fondo bajista estadounidense Gotham City Research el pasado 8 de enero de 2024. Una compra que además se produce una vez que el consejero delegado de Grifols, Nacho Abia, comprara un total de 10.000 acciones de la compañía por 86.800 euros, según los registros de la CNMV. Entre las subidas también destaca Telefónica en esta sesión que se convertía en el para acceder a su dividendo, pagadero el próximo día 19 de 0,15 euros brutos por acción, uno de los dos pagos que a lo largo del año y con cargo a los resultados del pasado año hace efectivos la compañía. Además hemos conocido que Bank of America ha recortado su participación en Bankinter del 3,198% al 2,891% y, por tanto, ha dejado de ser accionista significativo de la entidad. A principios de junio Bank of America notificaba una participación del 3,274% que elevó poco después al 4,000%. Sin embargo, la semana pasada ya aplicó una reducción de la misma hasta un 3,198% y ahora ha vuelto a rebajarla hasta ese 2,891%. Ya en el resto de Europa, vemos como la atención se centra en las compras y en dos valores: Renault y Kering. Caídas superiores al 8% para la primera y que exceden el 13% para la segunda en y cuya incorporación, que todos los analistas dan por segura, se podría anunciar en los próximos días. Y es que el emblemático CEO desde hace 5 años de Renault se va tras haber cambiado de arriba a abajo la firma que se hacía casi pedazos den 2018. Levantó la pandemia, tras llegar desde SEAT, desglosaba en segmentos la firma francesa y superaba el fiasco de Carlos Ghost. Agilizó la compañía, con el relanzamiento de Alpine, y la segmentación que revalorizó a la firma tradicional junto con Dacia, Horse y Ampere. Y es que la situación de Kering es ahora mismo, a decir de los expertos del mercado, la más precaria del sector para una compañía que engloba firmas como Gucci, Saint Laurent o Bettega Veneta, y que presenta una debilidad cuasi estructural en todas sus divisiones. Al cierre del lunes, el EURO STOXX 50 sube un 0,90% hasta los 5.337puntos, el CAC 40 avanza un 0,71% hasta los 7.739 puntos, el Dax gana un 0,87% hasta los 23.698 puntos, y la sesión en Londres para el FT 100 acaba con subidas del 0,25 hasta los 8.871 puntos. Y en Wall Street, subidas generalizadas también ante la contención del conflicto y la recuperación de la confianza de los inversores, en una semana corta, con fiesta el jueves y reunión de la Fed que concluirá el miércoles. Las acciones de US Steel suben por encima del 5%, hasta marcar sus máximos interanuales, después de que Trump aprobara la oferta de 14.900 millones de dólares de Nippon Steel por la compañía. La aprobación culmina un proceso tumultuoso de 18 meses que ha estado marcado por la resistencia sindical y dos revisiones de seguridad nacional. El acuerdo incluye 11.000 millones de dólares en nuevas inversiones hasta 2028, junto con compromisos en materia de gobernanza, producción y comercio. Por su parte, Roku gana más de un 9,4% en el mercado americano, una vez que la plataforma de streaming ha anunciado una alianza exclusiva con Amazon que brinda a los anunciantes acceso a lo que ambas empresas denominaron ""la mayor presencia autenticada en la televisión conectada "". El acuerdo permite a los anunciantes llegar a aproximadamente 80 millones de hogares estadounidenses a través de la plataforma de Amazon. Mientras, las acciones de EchoStar suben a media sesión más de un 48% para la compañía de satétiles una vez que se conociera el pasado viernes por Bloomberg que el presidente Donald Trump había presionado al director de la Comisión Federal de Comunicaciones (FCC) para que resolviera una disputa sobre el espectro. La compañía ha amenazado con declararse en bancarrota y afirma que las amenazas de la FCC bloquearon su capacidad para decidir sobre el despliegue de la red 5G. Al cierre de la bolsa española, el DOW JONES gana un 0,93% hasta los 42.590 puntos, el S&P 500 suma un 1,12%% y se coloca en los 6.043 puntos mientras que el innovador y tecnológico Nasdaq OMX gana un 1,59% hasta marcar 19.713 puntos. En la renta fija, caídas para las rentabilidades de los activos con el bono a 10 años español que eleva su rendimiento en el 0,10% de descuento hasta el 3,142%, frente a los recortes del 0,35% para el bund alemán, hasta el 2,527%. La prima de riesgo española baja un 1,44% hasta los 61,6 puntos básicos. Por su parte, en las materias primas vemos como el petróleo pierde posiciones, en el caso de los futuros del Brent, de referencia en Europa, con niveles que rozan los 71,49 dólares, y caídas del 3,68%, mientras que el West Texas Americano se revaloriza un 3,66% hasta los 68,68 dólares, a cuenta de la producción récord de EE. UU. Siguiendo con las commodities, Futuros del oro vuelve a ganar posiciones, con bajadas del 0,92% con niveles para sus futuros de 3.420 dólares por onza, camino de nuevos máximos. El Euro Dólar sube un 0,30% para la divisa común europea al cierre de la sesión bursátil española y se cruza con el billete verde en las 1,1587 unidades. Ya Bitcoin pierde posiciones, recorta un 1,90% hasta los 107.568 dólares por activo."

After all, that's what's making the entertainment world spin at the moment: reboots, relaunches, remakes, frame-for-frame live action recreations of animated classics. That energy was all over Pitt's wardrobe this weekend. In New York ahead of tonight's F1 premiere, the 61-year-old actor was spotted walking in and out of nice hotels with his partner Ines de Ramon and filming bits with Jimmy Fallon for The Tonight Show. Throughout it all, Pitt sported a handful of fits with a distinctive Fight Club-ian flavor to them. A cobalt blue velvet blazer here, a lilac silk shirt there, some tie-dye, a pair of tangerine cargo pants worn with a suede Gucci duffle. It's all very Tyler Durden. Eccentric, eclectic, retro, a touch random. Sure, it's maybe not an exact revival—no red leather jackets in sight—but it gave us perhaps a peek into Durden's wardrobe had he been a figment of someone's imagination in 2025. First, when checking into his hotel, Pitt wore a sheer burgundy polo, the neck worn open and loose, and a pair of bright orange trousers. He accessorized with a suede Gucci duffle and oversized tinted specs. Then, Pitt and de Ramon went out on a double date with Bradley Cooper and Gigi Hadid, wearing the aforementioned lilac silk shirt tucked into velvet-sheen gray trousers. (After returning from dinner, the trousers then had a sizable rip in the knee.) Courtesy of Gucci. AKGS TheStewartofNY Next came Durden's soap-factory look. Sorry, we mean, his Saturday morning fit. Pitt wore a pair of baggy nylon cargo pants, one leg of which was actually repurposed from an Aston Martin F1 racing suit. On top, a paint splattered green tee worn over a white long-sleeve and aviator shades. TheStewartofNY XNY/Star Max Later that day came the tie-dye. And considering it was for a skit on The Tonight Show, Fallon giggling beside him, we're happy to file it under 'costuming,' but still, the vibe stands. Aeon That night, Pitt and de Ramon headed out to dinner again. This time in a white striped button-up shirt, wide-leg jeans and an extremely luminous blue velvet blazer. And, again, the aviators. If we were still making comparisons—and we are! —we'd say this is the red leather jacket and Hawaiian shirt combo, updated 25 years later. Still a little quirky, a little oddball, but with the same cool factor. Look, the homages probably aren't as intentional as we think—“You're not your fucking khakis,” as someone once said—but Pitt would never admit it if it were anyway. After all, the first rule of Fight Club is… This story originally appeared on British GQ."

Since it's two pieces, you can also break it up and use the top and skirt separately to create tons of fabulous looks. Some reviewers say you can size down! Promising review: ""I am EMOTIONAL about how great this is. I'm a bodacious and curvaceous young lady, and finding anything that looks good online is a constant struggle. But I want to wear this every day. If I were in a cartoon, I would want this to be the outfit that I have a closet full of. I have G-cup boobs, and tube tops are my own personal hell. BUT, somehow, this sat just right. I wore a strapless bra under it, and I'm just so excited to wear this out. Did I mention the skirt is perfect?

A chic as heck two-piece set (oop, a rhyme) that'll have you looking as cute as the buttons on the long-sleeve shirt. This outfit is the moment, and you may almost tear up on that dreaded day when you have to put away your summer clothes, cuz you'll miss wearing this so much. Promising review: ""I bought this for vacation, but also just a cute summer set, and I love it! The shorts fit great, and the top is oversized just like I wanted. I wore it with a white cropped shirt and kept the top unbuttoned. I washed it right away and air dried it, and it wasn't ruined at all by the wash. I want to buy it in another color :)"" —Jessica Get it from Amazon for $29.99+ (available in sizes S–XL and 15 colors). And check out this similar style in plus sizes (available in sizes 16–24 and seven colors). 4. A midi dress and cardigan set so stunning, you'll be stopped every five minutes with questions about where you got it. Rebdolls is a Latine- and woman-owned small biz that makes clothes with plenty of bold colors and fun prints. Get it from Rebdolls for $79.90 (available in sizes S–5X and two colors). 5. A pair of linen pants with a matching vest that'll let everyone know the second you step in the room that you are a fashion icon. Promising review for the vest: ""I LOVE THIS TOP!! The pop of blue with the cream white screams summer and looks good against my skin tone. I'm so happy I went with this color. I'm normally a size S, but XS is all they had in stock, so I took a chance, and I'm glad I did. Beautiful piece that can be worn so many ways...."

6月15日，据短剧社群通知显示，快手将在6月17日关停短剧小程序相关业务，届时小程序任务都会直接下架。 快手短剧相关人士证实以上通知属实。 2025年6月，快手下架百余部违规微短剧，处置90余个违规账号，并将情节严重剧目列入黑名单。 同时加强巡查，防止违规微短剧通过改名或更换账号重新上线。 删除违规内容、关闭挂载权限、限制支付能力，甚至封禁小程序。 短剧小程序作为承接付费短剧的最佳形态在行业初期非常流行，但随着免费短剧的兴起，付费逐渐式微。 同时，快手也在去年不再进行小程序投流，转而发展端原生，加上违规题材频发，关停短剧小程序似乎也在意料之中。 京东物流将在沙特采取自营模式

Sur le marché boursier de New York, la moyenne industrielle de Dow Jones 30 a clôturé à 42 515,09, augmentant de 0,75% par rapport au champ de bataille. L'indice de 500 de Standard & Poor's (S&P) a clôturé à 6033.11, soit une augmentation de 0,94% par rapport au champ de bataille et à l'indice composite Nasdaq, qui s'est concentré sur la technologie, fermé à 19701,21, a augmenté de 1,52% par rapport au champ de bataille. Il a été signalé que l'Iran a indirectement livré l'armistice aux États-Unis, tandis que le conflit armé entre Israël et l'Iran s'est poursuivi le quatrième jour. Par conséquent, le marché a augmenté car les investisseurs ont renforcé le sentiment de préférences de risque. Les prix internationaux du pétrole ont diminué lorsque la perspective de conflits au Moyen-Orient ne s'aggravera pas de manière significative et que l'indice des actions, qui avait diminué en raison de la haute tension au Moyen-Orient le 13, a rebondi. Le principal propriétaire de la technologie Meta Platforms a augmenté de 2,9% et NVIDIA, Apple et Amazon Rose. L'indice des semi-conducteurs de Philadelphie a augmenté de 3,03% et le prix des actions a augmenté de plus de 8% en raison de la bonne nouvelle de la nouvelle puce AI. De plus, Estee Lauder a augmenté de plus de 10%, doublant sa participation à Estee Lauder. Nvidia a augmenté de près de 2% avec une évaluation positive que les ventes peuvent augmenter sur d'autres marchés malgré la volatilité du marché chinois. Les cercles ont continué de sortir de la récente introduction en bourse et ont augmenté de plus de 10%. L'augmentation de l'élan sur le marché des stablescoin et l'augmentation de la demande du marché financier mondial sont l'une des principales causes d'augmentation et également le “moment” du PDG du PDG a eu un impact positif. Lockheed Martin, en revanche, a baissé le prix des actions de 4% tandis que les combattants F-35 ont été abattus par le raid israélien. ◇ Même les actions européennes ont augmenté des attentes pour faciliter le conflit du Moyen-Orient. L'indice de Francfort Dax, en Allemagne, s'est terminé à 2 3699,12, augmentant de 0,78% par rapport à la veille. L'indice CAC40 du marché boursier de Paris en France a augmenté de 0,75% à 7742,24 et l'indice FTSE100 du marché boursier de Londres a augmenté de 0,28% à 8875,22. Le Wall Street Journal (-) a cité le Moyen-Orient et les responsables européens que l'Iran a envoyé un message à Israël et aux États-Unis que l'Iran voulait arrêter l'hostilité et reprendre le dialogue sur les programmes nucléaires. Cependant, on ne sait pas si Israël acceptera cette proposition. Israël a révélé que cette opération militaire se produira jusqu'à ce qu'elle détruit les structures nucléaires de l'Iran et les usines de missiles balistiques. Parmi les sports, la société mère de Gucci Kering a annoncé un remplacement du PDG et a augmenté de près de 12%. ◇ Le 16, le marché boursier asiatique a rebondi au milieu d'un différend entre Israël et l'Iran. L'indice Nikkei 225 a clôturé la transaction à 38 311,33, augmentant 1,26% par rapport à la journée de négociation précédente. Bien que les risques géopolitiques au Moyen-Orient aient augmenté, les secteurs qui devraient bénéficier de l'augmentation des prix internationaux du pétrole ont guidé le marché boursier japonais. Certains des stocks de semi-conducteurs, tels que les tests Advan, l'augmentation et les stocks liés aux exportations tels que les voitures et les dispositifs électriques étaient importants. En outre, la nouvelle que le Banca del Japan prendra en considération la réduction des achats d'obligations d'État à partir d'avril 2026 a été une bonne nouvelle. L'indice composite de Shanghai, en Chine, a clôturé à 3388,73, augmentant de 0,35% du champ de bataille. Le Bureau des statistiques nationales chinoises a déclaré en mai que les ventes au détail avaient augmenté de 6,4% des années. Cela est largement supérieur aux attentes du marché de 5,0% et représente une augmentation de 1,3 point de pourcentage (P) contre 5,1% du mois précédent. Bien que la nouvelle des indicateurs économiques soit un matériau positif, les fluctuations étaient limitées dans les préoccupations concernant les litiges et les taux du Moyen-Orient. L'indice Hong Kong Hang Seng a clôturé à 22 060,99, augmentant de 0,70% par rapport à la veille, et l'indice Ga -Gu Taiwan a clôturé à 22,49,90, en baisse de 0,10% par rapport au champ de bataille. ◇ C'est le jour principal d'aujourd'hui. Aux États-Unis, les ventes au détail et la production industrielle sont annoncées en mai. Samsung Electronics tiendra une réunion de stratégie mondiale. ◇ Perspectives et interprétations du marché boursier. Le marché boursier de New York a rebondi dans les signes d'atténuation du conflit du Moyen-Orient. Hwang Ji -yeon, chercheur en Corée Investment & Securities, a déclaré “La volatilité est susceptible d'être progressivement lâche et si calme “, a-t-il déclaré. En fait, il n'y a pas beaucoup de forces qui aideront activement l'Iran, et il est peu probable que les prix élevés du pétrole soient fixés à mesure que la guerre est prolongée comme une guerre de guerre. Hwang Ji -yeon a recommandé: “En termes de gestion des risques à court terme, il est important de garantir une certaine quantité de liquidité et de diversifier votre portefeuille en préparation de l'imprévisibilité des événements géopolitiques”.

NEWBY HANDS asks five A-list makeup artists to share their best bronzer tips – from PAT McGRATH's beautiful 'sun-sculpted' look to GUCCI WESTMAN's ultra-authentic 'tan' and SIR JOHN's double-bronzer trick Gucci Westman “'Real' skin is my thing, and my makeup has always been about looking authentic, so, when I use bronzer, I like to blend it over my eyelids, forehead and cheeks, and take it right up under the eyes, where we naturally catch the sun – but I don't use it on the lower face. You don't apply bronzer like you do blush, as it's about pushing the skin to a deeper tone. Don't do that classic three-shape over the face, either – over the forehead, cheekbones and jawline – as it doesn't work. If you're naturally oily, I also use pressed powder around the nose and T-zone, then apply my Westman Atelier Vital Skin Foundation Stick as a concealer, applying it with the Spot Check Brush to target where it's needed so it's much more believable.” Pat McGrath “It's incredibly easy to enhance bone structure and add warmth to the face with bronzer – it's what I like to think of as a 'sun-sculpted' effect. Using a fluffy brush, start with a light touch and build up gradually, sweeping it within the depth of your cheekbones, along the temples and around the perimeter of the face. Applying it where the sun would naturally add warmth gives that perfect sun-kissed look, and I also love to add touches of bronzer to the nose to create the ultimate sun-sculpted finish. Powder bronzers are extremely long-lasting and blend seamlessly with foundation, blush and highlighter, too; the Pat McGrath Labs Divine Bronze Collection is formulated with a blend of oil-absorbing powders and uses translucent, soft-focus pigments to ensure that it leaves your skin with no cast or cake-like effect. When it comes to which texture is better – cream or powder – it depends on your preference. I do, however, recommend powder bronzer even if you're also using a cream. Powder bronzer is great for layering over cream bronzer to help make it longer wearing, and powder bronzers are also quite easy to apply and blend.” “I always do two bronzers: a cream and then a powder. Even when I do brows, I use a pencil, then set it with a shadow, and when I do a cream blush, I'll set it with a little bit of powder blush. That duality when you're using two [textures] gives you a Teflon-like base. Even if you're using the most minimal amount, I like to set things. I like to use a cream foundation stick as a bronzer (go for a shade that's deeper and warmer than your complexion) and buff it in with a big fluffy blush brush – it's a beautiful way to bring in a little bit of a halo effect with a bronzed glow. Buff it in, then don't be afraid to set it with a powder bronzer – I like the ones from Tom Ford Beauty or Nars. Where you start is where you'll deposit the most color, so begin away from the center of the face, around the hairline, then bring everything in [by blending] a little bit across the cheekbones, underneath the jawline – this is important as we all neglect that area – and across the bridge of the nose.” Katie Jane Hughes “My favorite bronzer texture is a cream formula, and I always apply it after skincare but before makeup. You want to blend it down the neck and chest if they are visible, and be sure to really reinforce your application along the hairline, too, to make sure it looks as natural and 'real' as possible.” Daniel Martin “To get that natural 'tan', I like using two fingers – ring and middle – to apply the bronzing product on the highest parts of the face. Using your fingers this way, and not a brush, means you have more control and can build up the color little by little, rather than applying it full throttle; I use my hands a lot to build up makeup. To get that second-skin finish, you want to feel as if you're working the bronzer into your skin – I do like Charlotte Tilbury's Beautiful Skin Sun-Kissed Glow Bronzers, as they have that velvety, creamy finish that will hold in the heat.” Summer accessories to amp up your glow 5 items RELATED READING The model featured in this story is not associated with NET-A-PORTER and does not endorse it or the products shown"
my7u8d2,2025-06-17 05:52:11,en,REDDIT,"  Perhaps the main reason why good items on Vine are gone in mere seconds is because of the UltraViner extension. By using that extension and paying the people who develop and maintain it, Viners can program UltraViner to automatically and instantly order items for you (e.g., programming it to automatically order any computer, laptop, or cellphone product available on Vine that is over $200 dollars). The way it works is that once such extension is installed on your browswer and you pay for the upgraded subscription, it will automatically monitor all available Vine items (whether in RFY, AFA, or AI) and if it detects any item you have programmed it to order, it will order such for you. Moreover, it doesn't just do this for you on your computer, as it also uses the computers of other Viners who have UltraViner on their browsers. If UltraViner on their browsers detects any items that you have programmed UltraViner to order for you, it will instantly order such for you even if you are not online. To make this even worse, the developers of UltraViner have multiple Vine accounts of their own (based on what I have seen, it seems they have about 15-30 Vine accounts) and they routinely use UltraViner and its programmed order features to instantly scoop up many or most of the good items that become available on Vine, and as a result you will basically either never see such items or only see such for mere seconds (and perhaps at best for 1-3 minutes) before UltraViner orders it for them. They have programmed UltraViner to order thousands of types of items for them on their many Vine accounts, so that if UltraViner detects any one of the programmed items being available on Vine—using any of the brownsers UltraViner is installed on worldwide—it will virtually instantly order such for them (e.g., any item in Vine from Gucci or Prada or other designated brands; any leather jackets; any white tennis shoes costing over $100, sinks costing over $150, clothing costing over $100,  microwaves costing over $100, etc., etc). In this way, the developers of UltraViner routinely use it to instantly get for themselves many of the good items that become available on Vine within seconds of such becoming available, usually long before you ever see such and almost always long before you could ever order such. Try beating a computer program at speed ordering, and humans not using such program lose every time. And to all of you in this Reddit Vine forum that have UltraViner on your browser and who are paying to program it to order certain items for you, even you are getting ripped off because the UltraViner developers put your orders behind all of their own, and if you program UltraViner to order certain items for you, UltraViner only processes such orders after it has first processed the orders of the UltraViner developers. In other words, even if you have UltraViner, you won't get any good items unless the UltraViner developers do not want such for themselves. In a very real way, the UltraViner extension has been used to prevent Viners from being able to more frequently order good items for themselves. It is an extension that, if installed on your browser, helps the developers of UltraViner to get and order any and all good items on Vine for themselves long before you can ever do so for yourself. They even use UltraViner to see and order items in the RFY category when such items may only be released to a very few people in their RFY category before being moved to the AI category (the way Vine does it: items put in RFY are generally not put in AI for others to order until a 4-8 hours of being in your RFY and you not ordering such. If the item is released and put in RFY on 10 Viner accounts, if they don't order it within a few hours it will become available in the AI category). In other words, if Amazon decides to release an item to you and to 9 other Vine members in your RFY category, such item is generally not even accessible to anyone else in Vine apart from those 10 accounts until a few hours of being in RFY in those 10 Vine accounts and none of them ordering such. At that point, Amazon releases it to the AI category for all other Vine accounts to access. However, if one of those initial 10 Vine accounts has UltraViner on their browser, UltraVine can look at all items in the RFY category (even if they are in someone else's RFY and not visible to you on your computer). In this way, UltraViner also bypasses limits that Amazon has established between the RFY and other categories."

Analysten bleiben gespalten über die langfristigen Perspektiven des Luxuskonzerns. Auf einen Blick: Kering-Aktie steigt zweistellig nach CEO-Gerüchten Luca de Meo gilt als möglicher Turnaround-Kandidat Analysten bewerten Chancen und Risiken unterschiedlich Gucci-Umsatzrückgang und Schuldenlast bleiben Herausforderungen Seit Reuters meldete, dass Renault-Lenker Luca de Meo den Chefposten bei Kering übernehmen könnte, jagte die Kering-Aktie binnen einer Handelssitzung zweistellig nach oben. Der Luxuskonzern bestätigt zwar nach aktuellem Stand noch nichts, doch der Markt preist bereits ein Turnaround-Narrativ ein: De Meo gilt als Markenflüsterer, der bei Renault mit radikaler Kostenkontrolle und echtem Story-Telling glänzte. Kering Aktie Chart Genau das braucht Kering nach einem Umsatzrückgang von 19 Prozent bei Gucci im ersten Quartal. Die Anleger ignorieren sogar, dass der Luxus-Riese mehr als 7,4 Milliarden Euro Schulden schleppt – die Aussicht auf frisches Marketing-Feuer wiegt derzeit schwerer. Zwischen Bernstein-Skepsis und Kursziel-Fantasie! Die Analystenlage könnte hingegen gespaltener kaum sein. Das Analysehaus Bernstein Research bleibt beim Rating „Market-Perform“ mit einem 170 Euro Ziel und warnt, dass die Kering-Aktie erst beweisen müsse, Gucci wieder in die Spur zu bringen. JPMorgan ist noch vorsichtiger: Hier lautet das Rating „Underweight“ bei einem Kursziel von 150 Euro. Die kanadische Bank RBC belässt hingegen die Einstufung bei „Sector Perform“, verteidigt aber das alte Ziel von 170 Euro. Der Tenor: Ein De-Meo-Effekt könnte funktionieren, wenn Management und Familienpatriarch François-Henri Pinault dem neuen CEO Zeit und Budget geben. Kurzfristig bleiben die Divergenzen ein Volatilitäts­motor. Doch mittelfristig bleibt es entscheidend, ob De Meo die Preissetzungsmacht zurückerobert und Wholesale-Abhängigkeiten abbaut. Kering-Aktie: Drei Baustellen bis zur nachhaltigen Neubewertung! Erstens muss Kering die Margenlücke zu LVMH schließen; aktuell liegt die operative Marge des Mode-Segments in etwa fünf Prozentpunkte darunter. Zweitens steht eine Schuldentilgung an: Allein der Gucci-Kaufpreis für Alessandro Micheles Nachfolger verschlang fast zwei Milliarden Euro. Drittens drängen chinesische Wettbewerber wie Shein in die Hochpreis-Straße – eine Bedrohung, die die Kering-Aktie bisher kaum reflektiert. Positiv: Mit Balenciaga, Saint Laurent und Boucheron besitzt das Haus starke Marken, die im ersten Quartal bereits wieder leicht zulegten. Kering-Aktie: Kaufen oder verkaufen? !

ChatGPT tells me to prepare for an enclosed, sealed chamber that pumps out pure oxygen while increasing barometric pressure until air pressure is increased two to three times. The goals (if you believe in that sort of thing) range from increasing oxygen levels in the body to fighting infections. This is next-level intimidation. Hyperbaric intimidation. In Nashville . . . and Kidman is not a regular. In fact, NK has never entered a hyperbaric chamber. “Have you done this before? Do you know anything about it? This is so crazy, isn't it?” Kidman pondered the road ahead, then stiffened her spine to take the plunge. “Come on, Danielle! We're doing this!” There's a reason why fashion story interviews typically happen separately from the fashion shoot. Can you imagine photographer Dan Beleiu [IG] getting a message that he will be shooting Nicole Kidman [IG] for the May 2025 issue of Allure Magazine's beauty issue in a hyperbaric chamber in Nashville? Beleiu is chill, but he also likes self-expression and movement in his images. How large is this hyperbaric chamber? Forget that Kidman is styled by Shiona Turini in 4” heels for her 5'10” frame. Add fashion from Balenciaga, Gucci, Roberto Cavalli, Schiaparelli and more . . . with jewelry from DeBeers and Tiffany & Co./ Hair by Evanie Frausto; makeup by Yumi Lee; set design by Lizzie Lang While Nicole Kidman's life motto about moving forward may offend some younger women, it's one Anne relates to. In NK's case, her career just does not slow down. Ever since she wore the MiuMiu mini skirt, remaining oblivious to the morality-infused angst of younger women that Kidman should act her age, the red head with bangs staring back at us has been on fire. Pergament has no recollection of a time when the actor's career wasn't in high gear. Except that her latest pace seems to deny the force of gravity She has finished filming the second season of 'Nine Perfect Strangers', streaming this month on Hulu, in which she plays a Russian wellness guru who runs an unorthodox wellness retreat. Kidman has been hosting screenings of her latest movie 'Holland'. In 2024, she starred in the Paramount+ series 'Lioness', the Netflix series 'The Perfect Couple', the movie 'A Family Affair', and of course, 'Babygirl', in which she played a CEO having an affair with an intern. Adding in the animated musical 'Spellbound' and the drama series 'Expats', Pergament's calculator totals four films, four series, two years. Her roles include being a writer, a teacher, a guru, and a universe-crushing businesswoman with intense sexual proclivities. As for what's next, Kidman will star in and excutive produce a series adaptation of the Eliza Jane Brazier novel ""Girls and Their Horses” for Prime Video. #RHOA: Uh Oh? NBCUniversal is Considering Dropping Entire Housewives Franchise Following 'RHOA' Rookie Brit Eady's $20 Million Lawsuit Could Brit Eady's bombshell lawsuit mean the end of the Housewives franchise? There are growing whispers that NBC is considering ending the entire Real Housewives franchise following the $20 million defamation and harassment lawsuit filed by newcomer Brit Eady. Over the years, the network has faced a few big lawsuits and allegations, including a now-resolved legal battle with NeNe Leakes, union threats from Bethenny Frankel, and Leah McSweeney's lawsuit against Andy Cohen. According to insiders, Brit's lawsuit might be the straw that breaks the camel's back. A production insider shared with reporter Rob Shutter: “What made Housewives great – the chaos – is now its biggest threat. It's just lawsuit after lawsuit The drama made it great. But now it's a walking lawsuit. The champagne's flat, the taglines are tired – and Bravo may finally be done playing hostess.” As reported, during the grand opening of her spa, Kenya Moore showed explicit photos allegedly of Brit. After skipping filming for season 16 reunion special, Brit released a statement claiming she wasn't the woman in the images. She also alleged that the network was aware of this but still “falsely yet unmistakably implied” to the public that the images were of her. She added Bravo “contributed to a hostile work environment” by subjecting her to “unwelcome, offensive, and sexualized behavior and comments” when they required her to continue filming after a “gendered attack.” She's suing for defamation, intentional infliction of emotional distress, sexual harassment and more...."

465D26AE468605A692D16AE6E24A436E,2025-06-17 07:21:55,en,PRINT,"  FASHION Auto Executive to Take The Reins at Kering Kering, the beleaguered owner of Gucci, Saint Laurent, Balenciaga and other big fashion brands, announced Luca de Meo, right, the former boss of the French carmaker Renault, as its new chief executive on Monday, hoping the veteran auto industry leader can help revive the fortunes of the luxury goods giant. Mr. de Meo, 58, resigned on Sunday from Renault, which he had run since 2020. He also had stints at Volkswagen, Fiat and Toyota, but has never worked in the fashion industry before. On Sept. 15, he will become the new leader of Kering, the company said in a statement, replacing its longtime chief, François-Henri Pinault. ''The group is ready for a new stage in its development,'' Mr. Pinault said in the statement. Mr. de Meo ''is the leader I was looking for to bring a new vision and steer this chapter,'' he added. Mr. Pinault, 63, has been the chairman and chief executive of the group since 2005, when he first took the reins of his father's retail conglomerate, Pinault-Printemps-Redoute, and turned it into the luxury goods maker Kering in 2013. For a time, the company enjoyed spectacular growth, fueled by Gucci, which accounts for almost half of Kering's revenue. Kering shares, which rose as much as 10 percent Monday morning when media reports of the appointment first surfaced, closed 13.4 percent higher in Paris, a strong signal of market support for Mr. Pinault's decision to step aside. ELIZABETH PATON MEDIA Plan to Sever HBO Max From Cable Is Approved Warner Bros. Discovery bondholders overwhelmingly approved a plan to split the corporation and put in place a new capital structure related to the deal, the company said on Monday. Bondholders voted to remove restrictions that could have prevented the company from cleaving itself into two publicly traded companies, separating its studios and HBO Max streaming service from its fading cable networks. Credit investors also supported the company's plan to buy back nearly half of its $37 billion in debt resulting from the 2022 merger of WarnerMedia and Discovery. The company's longer-dated bonds ticked lower in trading following Monday's announcement. Its 5.05 percent bonds due in March 2042 were last bid at 67.825, down 10 basis points from Friday's market close, while its 5.14 percent bonds due in March 2052 traded 14.5 bps lower from Friday and last stood at 70.916. Shorter-dated notes ticked up slightly upon the release. The bondholders had until Friday to approve changes to debt covenants that would leave the legacy cable business -- and its bondholders -- holding most of the debt. The less indebted streaming and studio business, meanwhile, would have the flexibility to compete with rivals. But the details of the split, which analysts called highly complex, left certain bondholders concerned they could be left empty-handed. They said it would leave some holding unsecured bonds tied to the declining cable business, meaning they would lack collateral protection and come second in priority of payment to the secured bondholders in the event of bankruptcy.

08faf47dc8f87762b06a51b75d80b46a,2025-06-17 09:13:00,en,WEB,"  We're listening to music with our eyes now From Miley Cyrus to The Weeknd, visual albums are making a comeback Fashion June 17th, 2025 In an era where people listen to songs on Spotify while scrolling through their Instagram feed, the only way to capture attention is by creating something that engages all the senses. That's why video albums are back at the center of the music scene with the upcoming releases of the films Hurry Up Tomorrow by The Weeknd and Something Beautiful by Miley Cyrus, on June 23 and 27, respectively. Sight accompanies sound, forming a new language and creating an immersive and synesthetic experience. Music films work because today listening to music is no longer enough, an album needs to be dressed, staged, a phenomenon that's bringing videos back to artistic and commercial relevance. For music creators, video albums have become the ideal format to control the aesthetic narrative. This is how the best collaborations with fashion brands are born: from the red dress by Jean Paul Gaultier worn by Rosalía in Motomami to Craig Green's utility pants in FKA twigs' video album, clothing becomes an active part of musical projects. For those who grew up watching MTV, the idea of accompanying a single with a video is nothing new, but visual albums are a different story - just think of the Beatles' Yellow Submarine, a psychedelic animated film from 1966 that spawned the music album of the same name, or Interstellar 5555, the sci-fi project by Daft Punk released in 2003. In contemporary music, it's Beyoncé who officially pioneered this format with Lemonade, the visual album of her 2016 music release. In Lemonade, each outfit builds a specific atmosphere, with the twelve singles corresponding to as many chapters, each indicating a precise emotional state that marks the evolution of Beyoncé's most introspective and truthful work. To develop the album's visual imagery and narrative phases, the artist collaborated with British-Somali poet Warsan Shire, whose verses accompany the album's voice and visuals. As the images flow across the screen, we see the singer in an apocalyptic New Orleans destroying almost everything while wearing a yellow chiffon dress designed by Peter Dundas for Roberto Cavalli, or in 6 Inch, a track featuring The Weeknd, setting a house on fire wearing a brocade tuxedo and platform sandals by Gucci. [@beyhiveee0]oh hold up the smash it that you are[#beyhive][#beyonce][#beyonceknowlescarter][#holdup][#lemonade][Hold Up - Beyoncé] After Beyoncé, other musicians have flirted with cinema. Among the most notable are Kendrick Lamar with good kid, m.A.A.d city, Rosalía with Motomami, and FKA twigs with a 16-minute video for her self-titled EP M3LL155X; in each case, the artists moved toward a more cinematic than musical language. This year, things get even more interesting with Miley Cyrus and The Weeknd both taking over cinemas worldwide in the same month to tell the story of their new album releases. Although they may seem like two different projects, they actually stem from the same need: to create an entirely new universe. The former, with Something Beautiful, closely follows the style of Lemonade, giving fashion a starring role. «The fashion direction is always inspired by Miley and the music,» says Bradley Kenneth, Miley Cyrus' longtime stylist, in an interview with Vogue. «We actually hold the record for the largest collection of Mugler archives ever sent to a single individual, which is still surreal to say,» he adds, confirming that for the American pop star, the visual language of fashion is just as important as her music. With Something Beautiful, Cyrus returns to the heart of the concept: an album to be watched from beginning to end, with a strongly coherent aesthetic and an autobiographical narrative built through imagery. In Hurry Up Tomorrow, directed by Trey Edward Shults and starring Jenna Ortega and Barry Keoghan, The Weeknd brings to life his alter ego, Abel, and does so not only through feelings of uncertainty and unease, but also through his choice of clothing. In the film, while The Weeknd wears a long black hooded tunic adorned with gold inserts and latex gloves (the same outfit seen in his recent 'Till Dawn After Hours Tour), Abel always appears in jeans, a tank top, and a hoodie, representing his more real counterpart. The Weeknd is a music giant, and proves it through his always eye-catching clothing. Abel, on the other hand, still hides in the shadow of that music titan, wrapped in a simple oversized hoodie. What's clear, though, is that neither artist left their outfit choices to chance, aiming in every possible way to tell the story of their transformation, their insecurities, and their strengths. Fashion and music are once again in a symbiotic relationship. The former becomes an emotional director that allows for storytelling even beyond words. Together, these two languages, opposite but complementary, put into play a marketing strategy like no other. The format of audiovisual albums is the perfect solution for the pop industry: the audience, intrigued by the multisensory experience, is drawn in by both the visuals and the sound of the project. Moreover, with concert ticket prices skyrocketing, cinema screenings make the interaction between artist and fan more inclusive, bringing the magic of a live show everywhere at a more accessible price. Also not to be underestimated are the partnerships between artists and fashion brands, which make projects more compelling and support the often exorbitant ambitions of their creators. Video albums are exactly what we need now: not just a playlist, but a whole world to fully immerse in."

The appointment, announced Monday, sent Kering's shares in Paris up 12%, their highest one-day gains since December 2008. Renault shares fell 8.7%, their most in three years. De Meo, set to join on Sept. 15, will be the first outsider to run Kering, which is controlled by the billionaire Pinault family. Kering manages renowned fashion brands like Gucci and Balenciaga. Current CEO Francois-Henri Pinault will step down and remain the board's chairman. The appointment is a significant development for Kering, which has recently struggled to keep pace with rivals such as LVMH and Hermès International. The luxury industry continues to face headwinds from sluggish demand and pronounced weakness in the Chinese market, challenges compounded by U.S. trade tariffs that threaten to drive up costs and further dampen consumer spending. Kering's stock has plunged nearly 80% from its August 2021 peak, even as the company has taken on higher debt levels. ""The Group is ready for a new stage in its development,"" Pinault said in a statement, underscoring the company's plan to bring fresh thinking for its brands' revival. De Meo's ""sharp understanding of brands"" and his experience as a top executive""convinced me that he is the leader I was looking for to bring a new vision,"" Pinault said. De Meo has spent five years leading Renault after earlier roles at Fiat and Volkswagen AG. At Renault, he is widely credited for turning around the French carmaker and overhauling its strategic alliance with Nissan. Renault's stock market value roughly doubled under De Meo. So far this year, shares of Kering and Renault on the Paris bourse are down more than 16%. For updates and corrections, email newsroom[at]stocktwits[dot]com. MENAFN17062025007385015968ID1109684163"

66d5c0618c0e88e8c563c0bdf74fdde2,2025-06-17 10:43:00,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]El estado de la investigación y la aplicación de la combinación de IA y gestión en los círculos empresariales europeos PRESENTACION Como tema de fondo, “ The state of research and application of the combination of AI and management in European business circles “, hemos compartido unos días intensos de trabajo en diferentes universidades en Chengdu, provincia de Sichuan, República Popular China, fruto de la amable invitación de Mr. H.P. Shu, Vice President of Chengdu University of Information Technology, del departamento “ Laboratorio de Claves del Servicio de Inteligencia y Generación Automática de Software” y de Mr. X. He, Vice Dean de School of Economics and Management, Universidad Southwestern University of Finance and Economic . Este blog tiene el espíritu de compartir desde DEC los temas relevantes que hemos tratado en las universidades. Ha sido un placer participar en este encuentro con un público tan honorable y compartir con ellos, profesores e investigadores, los avances en Europa y España de las oportunidades que la IA presenta para las empresas y la investigación. Hemos transformado una conferencia como esta en una gran oportunidad para compartir conocimiento e inspirar ideas sobre cómo abordar la hoja de ruta de la Inteligencia Artificial en la gestión empresarial desde una perspectiva global e internacional. En este blog, abordaremos dos perspectivas que no siempre van de la mano: las expectativas del cliente en la actual sociedad BANI y cómo gestionan las marcas su experiencia de consumo, tarea compleja donde ser competitivo, innovador y fiel al propósito pasan al ideario de las compañías. En este eterno tándem, nos preguntamos, ¿cómo puede ayudar la IA a gestionar la relación en los negocios a nivel global? Y ¿qué estanos haciendo en España y Europa? Una vez más, debemos hablar de Experiencia de Cliente como eje catalizador de todos los temas abordados. ¿Y por qué es necesario vincular ambos conceptos, Inteligencia Artificial y Customer Experience? Vivimos en una sociedad global y competitiva donde la llegada de la IA nos sitúa a todos, empresarios y clientes, consumidores y empleados, en la misma línea de salida. Ofrecer una experiencia de consumidor diferenciada convierte nuestra marca en una decisión de compra. Por lo tanto, aprovechar este momento decisivo es una oportunidad de negocio para las empresas, pero esto no es posible sin los datos y la tecnología. Cómo ofrecer valor al cliente desde la tecnología fue el objetivo de las diversas ponencias y defender las claves necesarias para incorporar la IA en los procesos de negocio, de forma que sea rentable para la empresa. Así pues, y dada la relevancia de los temas, este blog se presentará en tres partes: La primera parte orientada al consumidor, sus nuevos hábitos de consumo y cuáles son sus expectativas sobre la irrupción de la IA como mediador de sus relaciones con la marca. Implicación de la IA en las tendencias de marketing 202. Qué se está haciendo en España y Europa en la gestión empresarial a través de la tecnología y principales casos de éxito Y como no podía ser de otra manera, cada punto de la teoría comentado se ilustrará con las estadísticas y datos correspondientes y los mejores casos de uso donde se puede comprobar cómo les está yendo a las mejores empresas de Europa. Entonces, hablemos de lo que están haciendo las empresas que tienen en pantalla: Affinity Balay Adidas Starbuks Mutua Madrileña Horizon Europe : Research and innovation program of the European Union. Barcelona Supercomputing Center : Advances in AI and management. Inditex and AI technologies: Case studies in logistics optimization. Acciona company and technological startups: Innovations in infrastructure and sustainability. Santander and virtual assistants: Use of AI in banking. Spotify and personalization: Implementation of AI in digital marketing. Randstad and Adecco : AI-based human resources innovations. Coca-Cola, Amazon, Procter & Gamble, Uber, BMW, Deloitte, IBM, JP Morgan Chase, Johnson & Johnson El nuevo consumidor 2025. ¿Cuáles son sus expectativas sobre la irrupción de la IA como mediador de la relación con las marcas? ¿Cuál es nuestro contexto de consumo actual? De la tienda física a la compra virtual Como podemos ver en esta imagen, hemos pasado de la tienda física al comercio digital a través de un proceso que no ha sido fácil ni inmediato. Para las empresas fue un reto definir su misión y visión, sus valores internos y catalogar todos sus productos y servicios para exponer su negocio de una manera atractiva. En una economía competitiva y global, la usabilidad, la ergonomía, la velocidad y la experiencia de flujo en el sitio web eran vitales. Y no era baladí. De hecho, uno de los mayores fracasos de muchas empresas es la mala implementación de su sitio web y la falta de confirmación de las expectativas de sus clientes. Otro de los retos fue implementar pasarelas de pago seguras, para que todo el proceso de compra pueda ser percibido por el cliente como un proceso cómodo y sencillo y, a la vez, absolutamente seguro. Una vez consolidado este e-commerce, alcanzamos cuotas récord. Por ejemplo, el 81% de los compradores online españoles realizó compras al menos una vez al mes en 2024 y 54.1 % ( CNMC , 2024) de los españoles dijeron que habían realizado una compra online durante los últimos seis meses. En 2025 nos encontramos en la era del s-commerce, donde las marcas han encontrado el sitio ideal en las redes sociales para ofrecer sus productos de forma visual y gamificada, cambiando radicalmente sus estrategias de comunicación. El objetivo no es la reputación o las ventas, sino crear comunidad. La llegada de la inteligencia artificial, la realidad aumentada y la realidad virtual aún es una incógnita. El metaverso deja claro su potencial en la recreación de espacios y la inmersión en experiencias, una situación de la que ya se han hecho eco marcas en publicidad, como Gucci o Burger King, o el Real Madrid. También en estrategias de apoyo al onboarding, como Universidades, Hospitales o Multinacionales en sus reuniones de empleados, o el mantenimiento de fábricas asistidas por gemelos digitales. La nueva era del consumidor: hiperconectado e informado En este proceso de transición digital, acelerado por la situación post pandemia, los ciudadanos del mundo ya son digitales , han aprendido a ser exigentes , a manejar altas dosis de información y a comparar con otras empresas, buscando la mejor oferta y al mejor precio. Y por supuesto, con la mínima calidad requerida y a través de servicios fiables y transparentes . Es decir, sus expectativas son muy altas, y las marcas han tenido que enfrentarse a grandes retos. Pero los desafíos están por llegar si pensamos en el nuevo sentido de propiedad y la reducción del consumo como respuesta al cambio climático...."

The Kansas City Chiefs star traveled with his brother Jason Kelce to attend the Cannes Lions 2025. The tight end was spotted flaunting an outfit worth $2770, featuring luxurious brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton. Travis Kelce's look consisted of a knit tech football shirt from a brand called Nahmias, which costs $695. The tight end paired it with black pants and a pair of Horsebit 1953 loafer from Gucci, worth $1,050. Kelce finished his looks with a saga snapback hat from Homebred Legends worth $50, and a monogram craggy necklace from Louis Vuitton worth $975. (110-25-1) (110-25-1) (110-25-1) The Kelce brothers took over the stage at Amazon Port Panel to talk about multiple things, including their decision to start the 'New Heights' podcast. Travis Kelce revealed the actual reason to start the podcast was to ""show everybody"" his brotherhood, family and his life outside the ""crazy football"" world.

""I think we've always wanted to show everybody our brotherhood, our family, how we're in this crazy football world together supporting each other from different sides of the country,"" Travis said. ""It was an opportunity to honestly spend more time together."" Before traveling to France with brother Jason, Travis Kelce was training in Florida for his reportedly last season in the NFL. Apart from training, Kelce has also been spending time with girlfriend, Taylor Swift. The couple was recently spotted enjoying the Stanley Cup final between the Panthers and Oilers last week. Travis Kelce to receive consistent support from Taylor Swift throughout 2025 NFL season The upcoming 2025 NFL season isn't just going to be special for Travis Kelce, but also for his girlfriend Taylor Swift. Unlike the last two seasons when Swift only attended a handful of Chiefs games, the Blank Space singer plans on attending more games this season. Talking about how the 2025 NFL season would be ""completely different"" for Swift, an unnamed source told PEOPLE: ""Not just because she loves supporting Travis, but because for the first full season since they started dating, she's not juggling a packed tour schedule. This fall will be completely different."" Taylor Swift concluded her Eras Tour in December, leaving her with enough time to spend with Travis Kelce in the offseason. Heading into the regular season, Swift will most likely be making more frequent appearances to cheer for Kelce. Feedback Why did you not like this content? Cancel Submit Was this article helpful?

44da3a9d345cd9c31de1550a1b98215e,2025-06-17 13:10:00,en,WEB,"  When Matt Davis and Calvin Gaines first met, they bonded over their shared love of Nike Blazers, a shoe that would one day feature heavily in their wedding. At the time, however, it just seemed like they were kindred spirits—two people who shared a number of overlapping interests, one of which that happened to be a specific style of sneakers. Over time, their relationship grew and became romantic. In August of 2023, Matt proposed to Calvin in a Paris garden, and the two spent the rest of the day shopping for rings. A few months later on November 27, 2023, they were legally married in London, and from that day on, the number 27 felt significant in their relationship. When they chose to have a follow-up celebration attended by all their family and friends, they let their lucky number help them set the date: When the couple toured The Bordone in New York City, a venue they were drawn to due to its modern architecture and city views, they realized there was just one open date available for the fall, and it aligned with their lucky number. Without giving it a second thought, they set the date for September 27, 2024, then got to work planning a wedding weekend no one would forget. Since their wedding would be a destination event for the majority of their 140 guests, Matt and Calvin wanted to host a weekend of activities to keep everyone busy. Still, they wanted to do things their own way, so the flipped the traditional wedding weekend order of events, starting with a wedding on Friday, September 27, followed by a more intimate post-wedding party at The Little Owl Townhouse on September 28; both events were inspired by Calvin's love of Beyoncé, the grooms' shared interest in sneakers, and their desire emphasize ""creative, personal, and non-traditional"" details. ""From the very beginning, we knew we wanted our wedding to be a true reflection of who we are—our style, our love story, and the things that bring us joy,” Matt says. “Every detail was intentionally designed to feel personal, meaningful, and unapologetically us.” Matt and Calvin knew they needed a visionary wedding planner to help them pull off all of their ideas, so they hired planner Lauren Gordon of Cherish Events to all the custom details. From a custom MTV-inspired logo and a sing-along style wedding ceremony to their ""sneaker chic"" dress code and ""Act II"" after-party, you won't want to miss any of the details captured in the photos by Larisa Shorina Photography. Matt and Calvin designed their wedding attire to be in keeping with the day's color scheme, which was emerald green and champagne with pops of rust, gold, pink, and orange. For the ceremony, Matt wore a custom champagne linen three-piece suit from Savile Road in London. When he couldn't find a tie that matched his look, he had one made from Cad & The Dandy. He accessorized with vintage Gucci cufflinks and leather suspenders. Calvin wore a custom green suits from Cad & The Dandy, which featured a subtle orange plaid pattern made from 100% bamboo fabric. Calvin also bought matching bracelets for him and Matt to wear on the wedding day. Matt worked with MattB Customs to create custom Nike Blazer sneakers, which featured his and Calvin's custom logo and color palette. Their wedding party wore matching sneakers as a nod to the shoes Calvin was wearing when the couple first met. The couple asked their groomsmen to wear rust-colored suits from Indochino. “From the beginning, we wanted our wedding party's attire to feel cohesive but not overly uniform, reflecting both our carefully curated wedding palette and the personalities of the people standing by our side,” Matt says. The groomsmen paired their suits with white shirts, champagne-colored ties, and their own custom Nike sneakers. The bridesmaids and other female members of the wedding party wore their choice of dress in metallic or rust colors. As guests arrived for Matt and Calvin's wedding, they were served pre-ceremony refreshments and given programs outlining the order of events. The programs also included lyrics to Tina Turner's “The Best” on the back, which allowed everyone in attendance to join in on a sing-along at the end of the ceremony. ""We are both sneakerheads, and our love story started over a pair of Nike Blazers, so it only made sense that sneakers played a major role in our wedding,"" the grooms explain. A ""sneaker chic"" dress code emerged, and guests were encouraged to pair their formalwear with fun, unique shoes. Attendees went all out, helping to make Matt and Calvin's vision a reality in the form of brightly colored footwear with unique accessories. Instead of traditional bouquets, Matt and Calvin had their wedding party walk down the aisle with champagne flutes and jello shot syringes, which had been finished with custom ribbons matching their color palette. “Since we're very social and love hosting, we thought this was the perfect way to make the ceremony interactive while keeping the energy fun and celebratory,” Calvin says. The grooms and their wedding planner chose a semi-circle design for their rooftop ceremony, which helped to create an intimate vow exchange experience in which they were surrounded by their guests as they reaffirmed their commitment to one another. They also chose a circular structure as their altar, which reinforced the day's theme of unity. Matt and Calvin each walked down the aisle solo, which was important to them. They wrote their own vows and exchanged them in front of their guests before celebrating back up the aisle during a sing-along recessional. “Live musician Najah Moser led all of our guests in an epic sing-along of Tina Turner's 'The Best,'” Matt says. “This moment was electric—everyone singing, clapping, and celebrating as we exited together, completely surrounded by love and joy.” In keeping with the party vibe they had started at the beginning of their ceremony, the couple also created a tequila shot wall that doubled as their seating chart display. They also served signature pink lemonade cocktails they called the Pink Pony. “We found 1950s-style Pink Pony Club diner signs on Etsy and incorporated them into the bar design and drink trays,” Calvin says. Matt and Calvin created a custom logo inspired by the 1980s MTV logo incorporating their special number, 27. The logo itself became a focal point of the wedding day's décor, seen on everything from the seating chart display to the menus and even the drink and food trays. At the reception, the couple and their planner incorporated a mix of textures and colors into the evening's designing, including organic floral centerpieces in shades of rust, gold, pink, orange, and green in mixed metallic and tinted glass vessels. Each table was named after a song title as a nod to Beyoncé's Renaissance album. “The linen selections were just as intentional as every other element, pulling directly from their custom-designed color palette,” Matt says. They chose gold-rimmed chargers and flatware to add a pop of metallic color to each table. Place settings were marked with a personalized menu that matched their invitation suite and featured the couple's custom logo, which was also projected onto the dance floor. Lighting was also important to Matt and Calvin, so they worked with their planner to choose lights that helped enhance the ambience they wanted for the evening. A custom overhead installation of greenery and neon light tubing created a modern and artistic focal point in the space while spotlights and color changing lighting were brought to the dance floor to enhance the party atmosphere...."

Dopo essere sopravvissuto all'èra del suo mentore Marchionne, con le trasvolate oceaniche notturne a base di sigarette, dopo aver navigato tra Toyota, Volkswagen e Audi, adesso ha rimesso in sesto Renault e ora si butta sul più disastrato marchio del più disastrato settore industriale che ci sia, la Kering di Pinault (il parente “povero” di Arnault).   Ma le dimissioni del ceo Luca de Meo  annunciate ieri non sono una cosa tanto da ridere perché il milanese ha dato non solo un addio al gruppo automobilistico, bensì all'intero comparto.   I confini tra auto e lusso sono assai labili, del resto anche il suo ex dante causa John Elkann non ha mai fatto molto mistero di voler un giorno disfarsi dell'auto diciamo generalista per concentrarsi sui brand di fascia alta (ormai si definisce “Ferrari owner”) e di considerarli non automobili ma appunto beni di lusso.   LUCA DE MEO EMMANUEL MACRON E magari fonderli un giorno lontanissimo con la Giorgio Armani, operazione di cui si vocifera da anni. Adesso vedremo se de Meo saprà risanare dopo ruote e portiere anche maglioncini e stiletti, soprattutto quella Gucci che era la Ferrari della moda e ora annaspa. Intanto la borsa segnala il peso di questo manager, Renault ieri ha chiuso in calo dell'8 per cento e Kering in aumento del 14.   Ma l'uscita di scena di de Meo non è solo una faccenda finanziaria. Gian Luca Pellegrini, direttore di Quattroruote e intellettuale non solo delle berline, ha scritto che l'uscita del manager è “un coup de théâtre che rivela qualcosa che nessun altro ha il coraggio di dire. Perché proprio ora […]? Che bisogno c'era? Che fretta?”.   LUCA DE MEO JOHN ELKANN Si chiede, Pellegrini, se “De Meo si sia convinto che il sistema automobilistico europeo non si rialzerà più. Che l'automobile, come fenomeno sociale e industriale, sia stata esautorata dalle élite, umiliata dalla politica, sterilizzata dalla burocrazia. E che tutto questo si sia riflesso in un'irreversibile crisi esistenziale dell'intero sistema […]. […]”.   In effetti i dati e l'osservazione empirica parlano chiaro: oggi prende la patente solo un giovane su tre, mentre un tempo soprattutto per i tapini come noi nati in provincia era un rito di passaggio ancor più fondamentale che fare il militare o il sesso. crisi del settore auto   Oggi avere la macchina nelle aree urbane è invece una bizzarria che segnala anche proprio l'origine provinciale o borgatara, e districarsi tra ciclabili e Ztl e aree C e D richiede pazienza da bonzi zen. Chi ha il diesel è considerato peggio del mostro di Garlasco.   […] Intanto i piazzali delle concessionarie sono pieni di auto invendute, che peraltro con il settore del lusso hanno una caratteristica in comune: hanno raddoppiato i prezzi negli ultimi dieci anni […]. Zeppe di elettronica probabilmente inutile, ingrossate come maggiorate fisiche, sono salite di costo come borsette di Hermès, e come queste ormai l'usato vale tantissimo, perché il  nuovo chi mai se lo può comprare? Chi ha una Smart a benzina in garage e una Kelly nell'armadio oggi è come il baby pensionato degli anni 80, ha vinto tutto.   crisi del settore auto […] C'è poi un fatto che forse ha contato pure qualcosa sulla scelta di de Meo: che, come in un film distopico, l'industria automobilistica europea pur di non girare a vuoto potrebbe riconvertirsi presto  in  industria bellica.   Non è una previsione strampalata né un film. Il governo francese ha chiesto dieci giorni fa proprio a Renault di iniziare a produrre droni militari.   “Al momento non è stata presa alcuna decisione”, hanno affermato da Renault, ma la richiesta del Governo è precisa.   francois henry pinault “Stiamo per intraprendere una partnership senza precedenti in cui una grande azienda produttrice di automobili francesi unirà le forze con una Pmi della difesa francese per produrre droni in Ucraina”, ha detto il ministro della Difesa Sébastien Lecornu  al Monde. Dunque de Meo potrebbe aver deciso che l'auto è finita, o comunque  diventare un produttore di armamenti magari non gli aggrada più di tanto, a questo punto meglio i vestitini...."

mov_5C90D047279873C680A72DC14DE02AC8,2025-06-17 23:31:02,en,WEB,"  A portable car vacuum, toilet target light, and 44 other products you don't *need* (except you do). 1. A handy portable car vacuum so you can clean your car without the extra effort of bringing your vacuum outside. (Because honestly, when do we ever actually do that?) It comes with three detailing attachments (a flathead, extendable, and brush nozzle attachment). You also get a carrying bag, filter brush, and spare HEPA filter. Plug it into the 12V aux outlet in your car and the 16-foot cord will give you enough slack needed to clean the entire vehicle! Promising review: ""Yes, it is not as powerful as my vacuum cleaner in the house; however, it cleaned out all the garbage, which I accumulated over the past autumn and winter, in the car. At the end of October, my husband and I went to the ocean, and as we tried to be neat — the sand was still in the car. Finally, I got rid of it! Now my beauty again is clean, as on the first day, when I bought her!"" —Julia Bright Get it from Amazon for $22.49 (available in two colors and in a cordless or corded version). 2. The Car Seat Key for parents and guardians who have had one too many manicures ruined by car seat clips. This makes buckling and unbuckling your little one *super* easy and it even hooks onto your keychain so you've always got it with you when getting in the car. Promising review: ""After I had my first child almost a year ago, I stopped getting acrylic nails because I couldn't get him out of his car seat without struggling or breaking a nail. I'd have to get them as an overlay or extra short. But I saw this product on TikTok and had to try it out, and OMG!! It works! It took me a while to figure out the best angle to get him out with it, but once I did, I went to the nail shop expeditiously!! LOL, if you've been thinking about this for a while, GET IT! It's worth it!"" —Tora318 Get it from Amazon for $14.99 (available in six colors). 3. A versatile chop, slice, and dice unit so you can prep (and cleanup!) in no time at all. The interchangeable blades just pop out and then you can pop them right into the dishwasher! Promising review: ""Makes life so much easier. I can't imagine chopping onions or bell peppers by hand anymore, and it does so much more. We used to have a Prepworks chopper which was a similar idea, but you had to press so hard to chop, and it broke after not too long. This one requires very little effort to cut through the food and it has a generous container."" —Amazon Customer Get it from Amazon for $29.97+ (available in four styles). 4. A 2-in-1 hair bun maker that'll help make all of those beautiful bun hairstyles on your Pinterest board come to life! You can even use it while your hair is damp and enjoy some effortless waves when you take it out! Curlinator Designs is a North Carolina-based small family biz that specializes in hair accessories. Promising review: ""Love it!!! I was concerned I wouldn't be able to figure out how to use it, but videos make understanding simple. So much easier to use in the mornings than fixing your hair in a bun!!!"" —bld9 Get it from Curlinator Designs on Etsy for $12.75 (available in 18 colors). 5. A soothing behavioral aid toy with a faux heartbeat — this is sure to be your puppy's ~dream~ toy and help *you* finally get to sleep while crate training. Promising review: ""My partner and I recently got a 4-month-old Italian greyhound puppy and this has been great. We slept with the stuffed animal a few nights before picking up our puppy and placed it in his crate before he arrived. After playing with us and exploring his new home he walked into his crate and curled up against it and went right to sleep. He slept right through the first night with no issue...."

myd8q62,2025-06-18 00:58:01,en,REDDIT,"  I also have an over the door I bought from Amazon. It said “best rated” and that was good enough for me. This being said, perhaps I should have put a little research into the size of the pockets. My clutches and evening bags, a few designer purses that are on the smaller side fit so well. I can get 2 clutches into one pocket. The drawback—for me at least—is I'm a big bag kind of woman. I have 3 big leather and one canvas and leather tote bags, as well as two Gucci Jackie's with bamboo handles and the bags don't even even come close to fitting in the over the door organizer. (Well, I can squeeze a tote into one of the pockets and it gets smushed). So I made my husband clear out about 3 feet of closet space (dedicated to his European soccer jerseys—that's another story) and I'm hanging the big bags on velvet hangers, 2 on each. This isn't my solution for the Jackie's because they are vintage and I don't want to contribute to their demise. Right now they are hanging on a doorknob but I know it's not ideal. Frankly, putting them in dust bags in a bin on the floor would probably work better for me. Thanks!"

一、 反向海淘到底是啥？ 💡
服务对象：海外用户想薅中国商品羊毛，但注册不了国内电商平台。 服务内容：当他们的专属买手！ 帮忙下单、验货，拍照拍视频确认，退换货烦恼直接清零～
盈利方式：赚商品差价、汇率差，还有服务和物流费，妥妥的 “中间商” 宝藏模式！ 二、搭建平台必走的 5 步流程（附避坑指南）​
1. 第一步：选对系统 = 成功一半​
✅ 选择一个靠谱的代购商城系统，核心功能刚需：​
多语言适配（英语 / 西班牙语 / 阿拉伯语一键切换）​；商品链接智能识别（粘贴淘宝链接自动抓图抓价）​；本地支付全覆盖（PayPal / 信用卡 / 东南亚银行转账）​
2. 第二步：死守合规红线（Pandabuy 血的教训）​
必做清单：​
⚠️ 禁售仿品！ 注册品牌库筛查（用 AI 工具自动识别 LV/GUCCI 等关键词）​
⚠️ 报关合规！ 对接海关系统，单个包裹价值控制在 5000 元以内​
⚠️ 税务备案！ 海外营收需在当地注册公司（如美国 LLC）​
4. 第三步：物流体验做到「超预期」​
用户最在意的 3 个点：​
✅ 时效可视化：可以接入集运系统，让用户可实时查看到港 / 清关 / 派送节点​
✅ 售后兜底：丢件包赔（按商品价值 1.5 倍赔偿）、破损免费重寄​
✅ 增值惊喜：免费提供拆包合箱服务（实测能帮用户省 30% 运费）​
5. 第五步：用「社媒矩阵」精准获客​
海外流量密码：​
TikTok：拍「中美价格对比」视频（如亚马逊 vs 淘宝同鞋测评），挂商城链接​
Facebook：投「华人聚集区」广告，主打「家乡味零食直邮」​
私域沉淀：用 WhatsApp 做客服，下单送「中国风贴纸」提升复购​
三、现在入局的黄金机会点​
流量真空期：Pandabuy 倒下后，700 万用户正在找新平台（实测社媒询盘量涨 50%）​
政策窗口期：中美关税差仍达 15%-25%，价格优势持续​
💡 最后提醒：这个赛道不是赚快钱，合规和服务才是护城河。 ﻿﻿#反向海淘﻿  ﻿#反向代购﻿ ﻿#cnfans﻿ ﻿#跨境电商﻿  ﻿#跨境﻿  ﻿#创业﻿ ﻿#pandabuy﻿ ﻿#海外华人﻿ ﻿#独立站﻿ ﻿#反向海淘攻略﻿"

mov_9054382DF0998B3867F7011392F23855,2025-06-18 06:03:58,en,WEB,"  With his scowling white face and upturned fang, Charun is an unsettling presence. He is, after all, the Etruscan charioteer of the dead whose demonic profile provides a chilling welcome to the Tuscan underworld. Next to him, a bronzed youth reaches out to caress an older man while a three-headed snake rises menacingly, as if to strike. Read Next: I'm staring at these remarkable paintings – which inspired a 2017 Gucci dress design – in a silent corner of southern Tuscany. Dating to the fourth century BC, they adorn the Tomb of the Infernal Chariot, one of 27 Etruscan tombs to have been excavated in the Necropoli delle Pianacce near the town of Sarteano, in the Valdichiana Senese. Abutting the better-known Val d'Orcia region, the Valdichiana Senese is one of Tuscany's less heralded destinations – a blissfully quiet valley of semi-deserted roads, lyrical landscapes, Renaissance hill towns and historic spas. It's made for slow travel. For walkers, it offers the chance to blaze new paths. “There aren't many marked trails but you'll find plenty of virgin territory – and with a guide you can do a lot,” Manuele de Bellis says as he leads us through the countryside around Sarteano. As we go, he dives into hedgerows to point out plants and stops outside a tiny church dedicated to the Madonna del Mal di Capo (the Madonna of the Headache). “Instead of taking an Aspirin, the local townspeople would come here to pray if they had a headache,” explains Manuele, indicating a stone with a skull-shaped hollow where they would lay their heads. Pain relief has also been traditionally sought in the area's thermal waters. Proof of this came in 2020 when archaeologists unearthed a sprawling Etruscan-Roman sanctuary in an abandoned orchard outside San Casciano dei Bagni. At its centre was a sacred pool – Bagno Grande – where the sick would leave votive offerings in the hope of a cure. “The sanctuary is one of the most important discoveries of this century,” says Emanuele Mariotti, the field excavation director. “When we started working on it nobody could have imagined it was as big as it was.” So far, more than 10,000 coins have been dug out of the Bagno's muddy depths, along with jewellery, lead feet, marble figures and an astonishing 24 bronze statues – the largest discovery of its kind ever made in Italy. These bronzes are on show in Berlin but you can still see a sample of finds in San Casciano's Palazzo Comunale up in the hilltop centre. The water in the Valdichiana is said to be good for the liver – “Chianciano fegato sano” (Chianciano healthy liver) was a 1970's advertising slogan for the spa town of Chianciano Terme. To test this claim we head to Chianciano and the Terme di Theia, a modern bath complex where the spa waters maintain a soothing year-round temperature of between 33°C and 36°C. There are few other people around and it's wonderfully relaxing to lie back in the main outdoor pool and soak away the afternoon to the sound of the breeze in the nearby trees. Livers fortified, we push on to Montepulciano, the Valdichiana's main hub and the one place we experience an obvious tourist presence. A classic hilltop borgo, complete with a steep medieval centre and sweeping views, Montepulciano is a celebrated wine town, renowned for its Vino Nobile. To taste this full-bodied Sangiovese red we duck into Cantina De' Ricci, a historic cellar in the centro storico. Dating to the 14th century, the cellars were taken over by the Trabalzini family in 1959 and it's the current owner's son, Niccolò Trabalzini, who shows us around its cavernous spaces. He recounts the cellars' history and how wine has long been a boon to local life. Wine is calorific, he says, and in times of famine the townsfolk would drink it for sustenance, hence the local saying, “ubriachi ma salvi” (drunk but saved). Wine isn't the Valdichiana's only traditional business. Terracotta has been produced and worked in the tiny hamlet of Petroio for centuries and at the village's Museo della Terracotta, we learn how production developed in the area. We hear about the family workshops that until recently animated life in the village and the memorable characters who worked in them. It is a story of artisanal pride and changing times – of 15 workshops that once operated here, only two now remain – and one that hits home as we wander the village's clay-red streets, alone but for a few children playing. British Airways and Vueling serve Florence airport from Heathrow and Gatwick. Car hire at Florence airport costs from €56 (£48) per day. Staying there In Montepulciano, Palazzo del Mercante has doubles from €150, B&B. In San Casciano dei Bagni, Fonteverde Lifestyle and Thermal Retreat has doubles from €324, B&B and spa access.

d4e241e991cf18d9d84d10e58ce149ed,2025-06-18 07:34:00,en,WEB,"  Metaverse Market Size to Reach USD 1,583.87 Billion in 2033 | IMARC Group 06-18-2025 09:21 AM CET | Business, Economy, Finances, Banking & Insurance Press release from: IMARC Group Metaverse Market Market Overview: The metaverse market is experiencing rapid growth, driven by advancements in virtual and augmented reality technologies, increasing corporate investments and partnerships, and growing demand for remote collaboration and social interaction. According to IMARC Group's latest research publication, ""Metaverse Market Size, Share, Trends and Forecast by Component, Technology, Application, Industry Vertical, and Region, 2025-2033"", the global metaverse market size was valued at USD 132.60 Billion in 2024. Looking forward, IMARC Group estimates the market to reach USD 1,583.87 Billion by 2033, exhibiting a CAGR of 36.35% from 2025-2033. This detailed analysis primarily encompasses industry size, business trends, market share, key growth factors, and regional forecasts. The report offers a comprehensive overview and integrates research findings, market assessments, and data from different sources. It also includes pivotal market dynamics like drivers and challenges, while also highlighting growth opportunities, financial insights, technological improvements, emerging trends, and innovations. Besides this, the report provides regional market evaluation, along with a competitive landscape analysis. Download a sample PDF of this report: https://www.imarcgroup.com/metaverse-market/requestsample Our report includes: ● Market Dynamics ● Market Trends and Market Outlook ● Competitive Analysis ● Industry Segmentation ● Strategic Recommendations Growth Factors in the Metaverse Market ● Advancements in Virtual and Augmented Reality Technologies The rapid advancements in VR and AR capabilities are a hallmark of the metaverse marketplace and will continue to be a catalyst for authenticity within those markets. New, non-obtrusive, user-friendly hardware is helping to usher in a new type of immersive experience. Lightweight, wireless virtual reality headsets from series like the Meta Quest, and high-performance augmentation reality eyewear such as the Microsoft HoloLens, are now for the first time allowing metaphors to connect users back to their virtual toolsets. The exciting fact is there is hardware emerging with cross-functional capabilities that may blur the lines of realism, constructing 3D environments, and leveraging extreme engagement with the virtual user. As companies like NVIDIA work to enhance both real-time computing and connectivity, they are also using high-performance graphic units to help provide users with the highest fidelity graphics and experiences, as seen in platforms like Decentraland. Not to mention the impacts of hardware enhancements, such as haptic feedback and motion tracking, that are encouraging prospective industries to explore the metaverse as a transaction venue (Gaming, Education, Healthcare, etc.). ● Increasing Corporate Investments and Partnerships The growth of the metaverse has been bolstered by major corporations making major investments and creating key partnerships. Technology players like Meta, Google and Epic Games have invested resources into building ecosystem-wide metaverse infrastructure gaining insight into its potential to change industries. Examples like Meta's rebranding from Facebook and business decisions to invest into Horizon Worlds show their high level of commitment to creating many interconnected virtual spaces. Additionally, partnerships like the metaverse play between Roblox and brands like Nike for virtual storefronts are typical ways in which companies are leveraging the metaverse for marketing and consumer interaction. These investments are not just doing exclusive amounts of work towards creating usable platform capabilities. They continue to spur innovation, encouraging smaller companies to enter the space and provide more general use traction across industries with a metaverse focus. ● Growing Demand for Remote Collaboration and Social Interaction The transition to remote work and socializing online has fueled the metaverse's attractiveness as a communication and collaboration tool. Virtual platforms such as Spatial and VRChat create environments where users can interact as avatars simulating in-person experiences. For instance, organizations utilized Microsoft's Mesh platform to conduct virtual staff meetings, putting employees from different geographic locations into immersive environments to work together as if they were in the same location. The metaverse also meets social needs such as socializing; platforms like Rec Room host millions of users in engagement through gaming and events. This demand for more seamless and engaging digital interactions has helped grow this market, as businesses and consumers look for alternatives to traditional communications in a digital-first world. Key Trends in the Metaverse Market ● Rise of Virtual Economies and Digital Ownership Virtual economies are developing in a big way, with users buying, selling and trading virtual assets and property on metaverse platforms. Blockchain and non-fungible tokens (NFTs) allow users to securely own a digital good, such as digital art, or virtual goods such property in the metaverse or real estate in other virtual worlds. For example, The Sandbox allows their users to purchase virtual land to create virtual experiences. The Sandbox is helping to kick off a creator-based economy. Luxury brands are also entering into the metaverse offering virtual products and brands (Gucci, for example, had a few virtual products available in play on Roblox). Virtual economies are allowing users to monetize their creativity while businesses are creating new revenue streams. Digital ownership is playing a big role in development of the metaverse marketplace and economically. ● Integration of Artificial Intelligence for Personalized Experiences Artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming how users experience the metaverse by shaping their experiences to be personalized and dynamic.

myev2bp,2025-06-18 08:02:21,en,REDDIT,"  I just found (out of curiosity looking) a bunch of sites (real deal, poshmark) selling high end (gucci) PREWORN PANTIES. Unbelievable. Im so sorry as much as I like designers and nice stuff I will ANYDAY  buy a brand new pair from Target for $2.99. People here saying im ""nose up"" for not wanting preworn clothes are shocking. I replied to one of them that I know of an insanely expensive couple vendors that sell designer 60s style furniture and I would totally buy those if I was gonna pay $26k for a vanity or $15k for a coffee table, but that's outside my budget, and those are collector pieces by famous designers of the era . But then to judge people for not wanting clothes someone else sweated on many times? And in your scenario washed with unknown detergents which is also a valid concern.....and then telling me im being obnoxious because people may not have money.....im sorry this is America you can go on Amazon, Target, Walmart etc and buy cheap brand new stuff for cheaper than these ""used"" items. Even stores I really like (free people etc.. .) have a ""preworn"" section I steer clear of. Unbelievable."

OTB Chairman Renzo Rosso called Risso “a unique designer and an artist at heart,” adding, “I wish him only the best for the future.” The statement did not say when a new creative director would be announced. It comes amid a number of high-level creative director shifts in the fashion world, including at Gucci,Chanel and Balenciaga, but also within the relatively small OTB group based in the northern region of Veneto and controlled by Diesel founder Rosso. Within OTB's portfolio, Simone Bellotti took over as creative director of Jil Sander in June, replacing Lucie and Luke Meier, and Glenn Martens has replaced John Galliano as creative director of Maison Margiela. During his decade at Marni, Risso captured the brand's fantastical whimsy with surreal sculptural elements and artistic collaborations that incorporated the brand's codes like fur detailing and floral elements. His shows were often elaborate sets that defied the runway convention, in one instance gathering personal friends of the brand around a banquet table wearing a favorite personal garment that had been customized, or seating guests on randomly grouped wooden chairs. OTB credited Risso with “a bold creative evolution” that renewed womenswear, expanded menswear and was characterized by “immersive shows and experiences.” Risso's “instinctive approach to emotional storytelling brought a deeper sensitivity to the brand, and welcomed a wide range of artistic collaborations that opened the house up to new cultural spaces,'' the statement said. Risso said working at Marni “taught me how to build with feeling, and how powerful true collaboration can be.” Thanking the Marni team, he added, “and here's to more extraordinary journeys ahead!” without hinting at his next move."

mov_DD3835C992001210CBCA08CCA6AF4081,2025-06-18 13:42:47,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Las 24 Horas de Le Mans y el Gran Premio de Canadá, que coincidieron el fin de semana en el calendario de la Federación Internacional del Automóvil (FIA), resultaron las dos últimas citas en las que Alpine tuvo el soporte de Luca de Meo como CEO del Grupo Renault. El italiano anunció desde el circuito de La Sarthe que renunciaba al cargo que había asumido en 2020, para desempeñarse en Kering, el conglomerado francés que comercializa marcas de vestimenta de lujo, como Gucci, Balenciaga, Yves Saint Laurent. La salida, que se concretará el 15 de julio, generó incertidumbre en el automovilismo deportivo, en particular en la Fórmula 1 y el Mundial de Resistencia (WEC), las dos categorías de elite en las que compite Alpine. Flavio Briatore, asesor ejecutivo de la escudería que tiene sede en Enstone y quien se unió a la estructura por pedido de De Meo, desestimó que la novedad tengo un efecto destructivo en la escudería de F. 1. “No cambia nada. Ni para mí ni para el equipo. Nada, absolutamente nada”, dijo la voz firme y serena de un personaje polémico, disruptivo y de manejos absolutistas. En una charla con La Voz del Interior, Briatore fustigó a los medios argentinos y a los odiadores de las redes sociales que esmerilan la tarea de Franco Colapinto en Alpine. Sin un anuncio del Grupo Renault sobre quién será el reemplazante, los enigmas se multiplican: De Meo fue el motor y el defensor del programa de F. 1 y del WEC, inyectando flujos de dinero en las dos estructuras y respaldando el plan en los pasajes más críticos del recorrido. Pero el hito de los 100 grandes premios de Alpine en el Gran Circo, que se cumplieron el fin de semana pasado en Montreal, no fue motivo de festejos: los autos de Franco Colapinto y Pierre Gasly entregaron un flojísimo rendimiento y malos resultados, a pesar de que el argentino largó en el 10º puesto. Los mecánicos trabajan en el auto de Gasly; en la perspectiva de Briatore, la salida del CEO de Renault, Luca de Meo, no afectará al equipo Alpine de Fórmula 1. - Créditos: @Bryn Lennon - Formula 1 Un motor falto de potencia, una estrategia enredada y transitar en grupo y con aire sucio fueron suficientes razones para caer en el clasificador. El centenar de carreras era el plazo que había fijó Laurent Rossi, el jefe del equipo en 2021 –año en que Alpine hizo su estreno, al ponerle nuevo nombre a la estructura de Renault– para hilar triunfos y pulsear a fondo por campeonatos. Pero a Rossi lo sucedieron Marcin Budkowski, Otmar Szafnauer, Bruno Famin y Oliver Oakes y la estadística rechaza aquel alentador pronóstico: el cuarto puesto en el Mundial de Constructores de 2022 (la mejor posición de la escudería); una única victoria, de Esteban Ocon en Hungría 2021, y otros cinco podios son todos los logros de Alpine en casi cuatro temporadas y media. Festeja Esteban Ocon en el Gran Premio de Hungría 2021, la única victoria de Alpine en la Fórmula 1 en sus 100 carreras; la escuadra debutó en 2021, tomando la estructura de Renault. - Créditos: @Dan Istitene - Formula 1 Devolver a Briatore a la Fórmula 1, que en 2009 fue expulsado de por vida de la categoría a raíz de la investigación del Crashgate –accidente que protagonizó Nelson Piquet (h.) por orden del jefe de Renault para favorecer la victoria de Fernando Alonso en Singapur 2008– y luego autorizado por una intervención de la justicia francesa, fue una apuesta de De Meo, que le brindó al italiano poder para la toma de decisiones, pero el cargo ejecutivo no incluyó aparecer de modo oficial en el esquema de Alpine ante FIA. Por esa razón, tras la dimisión de Oakes, Flavio no podía ser nombrado jefe del equipo. En la prueba de clasificación del Gran Premio de Canadá, Colapinto logró su mejor performance en Alpine; el argentino no pudo coronar en la carrera la tarea por las deficiencias del modelo A525. - Créditos: @CLIVE ROSE Los movimientos que desanduvo Alpine invitan a imaginar que el proyecto deportivo tendrá continuidad, sin importar el nombre del sucesor en la cabeza del Grupo Renault: el cierre de la fábrica de motores de Viry-Châtillon, por el que en 2026 Alpine será equipo cliente de Mercedes y con la apuesta ahorrará alrededor de 80 millones de euros anuales, es la determinación de mayor impacto que impulsó Briatore y que tuvo el consenso de De Meo. También fue el italiano quien recomendó la contratación a Colapinto, con apoyo del CEO. Y la frase “no cambia nada” también incluye la posición del argentino, que después del Gran Premio de Miami, sexta fecha del calendario, reemplazó a Jack Doohan en la segunda butaca de Alpine. “El equipo está bien con Franco y punto. Es parte del equipo; no sé de qué rumores hablan. El problema es que la prensa publica mucha basura. La culpa es de ustedes, no de nosotros. Todas estas cosas vienen de Argentina y de la gente de allí. Tendrían que culparse a ustedes mismos”, apuntó Briatore, que en una entrevista con La Voz del Interior en Montreal empujó para que el pilarense recibiera un escudo y no se conviertiera en blanco de los haters. PUBLICIDAD “Las redes sociales están llenas de idiotas. Ustedes [por los periodistas argentinos] tienen a un piloto de F. 1 y deben protegerlo: es un chico joven, y no es fácil al principio. No es fácil para nadie, pero él mostró que empieza a tener confianza con el auto. Los ingenieros están muy contentos... La fecha límite es para ustedes. Necesitamos apoyar a Franco. Olvídense de los rumores, y si hay rumores, pregúntenme a mí”, fue la tajante respuesta sobre una posible fecha de vencimiento, ante una eventual ausencia de buenos resultados, del contrato que pone a Colapinto en una butaca de Alpine. Los dos ciclos exitosos que desanduvo con Renault son el aval para la tarea de reorganización que realiza Briatore en Alpine; el italiano respalda a Colapinto. - Créditos: @SOPA Images Con el retorno de la caravana desde el territorio americano, después de que muchos pilotos estuvieran en Nueva York para la avant premier de F1 The Movie en Times Square, Briatore ya se mostró en la fábrica de Enstone, apuntalando la tarea de ingenieros y de mecánicos que intentan revertir un comienzo incómodo de calendario. Mientras, el Grupo Renault define quién será el CEO, el hombre que proyectará y dirigirá los futuros pasos de Alpine en el Gran Circo y en el Mundial de Resistencia."

The global handbag market is experiencing sustained growth, driven by evolving fashion trends, increased consumer spending, and changing lifestyle preferences. Handbags have transitioned from being mere utility items to key fashion statements that reflect personal style, status, and identity. Consumers across various age groups, particularly millennials and Gen Z, are increasingly treating handbags as both functional accessories and fashion essentials, boosting global demand. In response, brands are expanding their product ranges, experimenting with diverse designs, and catering to niche audiences. The increasing participation of women in the workforce, coupled with rising disposable incomes in developing economies, has further fueled this growth. Handbags are now purchased not only as luxury items but also as practical, everyday tools for modern living. One of the key driving forces behind this market expansion is the rise of brand-conscious consumers who seek premium and designer handbags that signal prestige. Established fashion houses like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Prada, and Hermès continue to dominate the high-end space, while newer entrants and affordable luxury brands are capturing younger audiences looking for aspirational yet accessible products. The power of celebrity endorsements, influencer marketing, and social media exposure has played a critical role in shaping consumer preferences, encouraging impulse buying, and driving global sales. Moreover, sustainability and ethical production have become important considerations in handbag purchasing decisions. As global awareness around climate change and ethical labor practices grows, many consumers are shifting toward environmentally conscious brands that use recycled materials, vegan leather, and transparent supply chains. The demand for sustainable handbags is encouraging innovation in design and materials, with several companies incorporating eco-friendly components without compromising on style or durability.

Handbags are no longer just accessories—they are lifestyle statements.

Consumers now prioritize features like durability, multi-functionality, and brand appeal.

The actor has been collaborating with Taylor McNeill to create fresh, fashion-forward looks as he promotes his latest film, “F1: The Movie.” Pitt has been donning some youthful looks throughout the press run for the upcoming summer blockbuster, including a pair of Adidas Predator sneakers. Pitt was spotted in Midtown on Tuesday in New York City after checking out of his hotel following the “F1” premiere, which took place on Monday.

The shoes were designed specifically for women with a lightweight design to be used for indoor soccer. The sneakers were re-released in July 2024. They are still available in other colorways. Pitt matched his girlfriend, Ines de Ramon, in all-blue ensembles as they left their hotel. The actor wore an all-blue, long-sleeve belted boiler suit with silver zippers and buttons throughout.

For his red carpet looks and other appearances during the “F1” press tour, Pitt has continued to work with his longtime style collaborator, George Cortina. “F1” follows the story of Sonny Hayes, who was Formula 1's most promising driver in the 1990s until an accident on the track nearly ended his career. Thirty years later, the owner of a struggling Formula 1 team convinces Sonny to return to racing and become the best in the world. Driving alongside the team's hotshot rookie Joshua Pearce (Damson Idris), Sonny learns that the road to redemption is not something you can travel alone. The film hits theaters next Friday.

From enjoying an NHL date night in Florida to attending a wedding together in Tennessee, the two have been making the most out of their time off from work. Interestingly, the couple might also be catching up with each other's bucket list for films. In episode 143 of the ""New Heights"" podcast, Kelce revealed a movie that has been on his and Swift's watchlist for a while. Name-dropping the iconic '90s rom-com, Kelce said: ""We mentioned 'Pretty Woman' that's been on me and Tay's movie list for a while. I'm down to watch it.""

Kelce's movie revelation came almost a day after he attended the Cannes Lions 2025 in France with his brother Jason Kelce. The tight end went viral for his luxurious outfit, which included some luxurious brands like Louis Vuitton. Kelce wore a white knit football shirt from Nahmias, which he paired with black pants. For footwear, Kelce went with Gucci's Horsebit 1953 loafer. To finish his outfit, the tight end wore a Louis Vuitton necklace and Homebred Legends' snapback hat. 2025 season 'will be completely different' for Taylor Swift and Travis Kelce The upcoming 2025 NFL season will be really special for Travis Kelce, as he will be receiving undivided attention and support from Taylor Swift. Unlike the previous two seasons when Swift couldn't manage attending more than a handful of Chiefs games due to her busy Eras Tour schedule, the pop singer's support ""will be completely different"" this season, according to People. Another source told the publication that Swift has been ""genuinely excited to have the time and flexibility to show up for Travis more consistently."" Therefore, it can be anticipated that Swift would attend more Chiefs games and help the franchise get more wins with her luck factor. Feedback Why did you not like this content?

Nonostante le voci sulla rottura con l'influencer Olivia Jade Giannulli non siano mai state confermate, i recenti scatti che ritraggono Jacob Elordie in compagnia della ragazza italiana sembrano voler confermare quello che un rumors sui social ipotizza da settimane: Jacob non sta più con Olivia. Adesso, quindi, le domande cambiano: chi è questa nuova ragazza? Riceverà l'approvazione pubblica che (forse) Olivia non ha mai avuto? Ma, soprattutto, come è riuscita a catturare il cuore dell'antieroe Heathcliff? Sembra che non sia solo la lista dei film con Jacob Elordi come protagonista a crescere di giorno in giorno: anche l'attenzione sulla sua vita sentimentale non accenna a diminuire. La fanbase dell'attore australiano segue con costanza ogni aggiornamento sulle sue relazioni, e dal momento che perfino le più attente potrebbero essersi perse gli ultimi sviluppi, ecco un piccolo identik di quella che pare essere la nuova fidanzata italiana di Elordi. Chi è la ragazza italiana con Jacob Elordi? Dopo le ultime fotografie pubblicate dalla pagina DeuxMoi, dove Elordi e una misteriosa ragazza camminavano assieme indisturbati a Roma, i rumors hanno insinuato che fosse l'inizio di una nuova frequentazione per il protagonista di Saltburn. La ragazza si chiama Chiara Marchi ed è una costumista italiana attiva nel mondo del cinema da tempo, a cui merito vanno tutto il guardaroba degli attori c'è House of Gucci (la storia di Patrizia Reggiani interpretata da Lady Gaga e Adam Driver) e Un Altro Piccolo Favore, uscito a maggio su Amazon Prime con protagoniste Blake Lively e Anna Kendrick e Michele Morrone. È possibile, quindi, che se la scintilla dovesse essere reale, sia scoccata tra un ciak e l'altro di un set cinematografico. Jacob Elordi e Chiara Marchi assieme a Roma Secondo quanto riportato dall'account, Jacob Elordi e Chiara Marchi sarebbero apparsi molto affiatati, ridendo e scherzando tra le vie romane. Nella spontaneità del momento, la ragazza si è cambiata tra le macchine parcheggiate, mentre Jacob la attendeva già munito della più classica tra le tenute marittime: cappellino, occhiale da sole nero e l'immancabile asciugamano attorno al collo. La destinazione verso cui si sono diretti non si conosce, ma il look e la stagione non fanno che indicare la spiaggia. Non sappiamo di preciso le motivazioni che hanno portato Jacob Elordi in Italia (presumibilmente un nuovo film). Ma ci piace sognare: e se avesse preso volo intercontinentale per un date tra Roma e la spiaggia? Solo il tempo e i nuovi scatti, che aspettiamo con impazienza, ci potranno dare qualche risposta in più. Mentre siamo in attesa, potremmo farci un rewatch di qualche film con Jacob Elordi, anche se non vediamo l'ora di vedere l'attore nei, nuovi, panni di Frankenstein."

On Wednesday, Ed appeared on the Kelce brothers' 'New Heights' podcast and recalled sharing relationship tips with Jason during one segment. Ed Kelce started by explaining how Jason came to him during his school years, seeking advice on ""what to talk about"" with girls. Recalling the advice that Ed gave him, the father-of-two said (Timestamp: 48:27): “I do remember a brief discussion Jason and I had. You said, 'I really don't know what to talk about.' And I told you that, and it's true for every guy—any guy listening. ' You know, I know I play football. I know everybody likes to talk about that. But tell me about you.'""

[embedded content] Moving forward, Ed explained how the key to getting girls interested in someone is to ""shut up and get them to talk about themselves, and you ain't gotta say another word."" Nevertheless, according to Ed, what men should do instead is: ""Nod your head, 'Oh wow, yeah, cool.' You know, they add little comments in there to make her feel good and just... you don't have to say nothing.” Jason and Travis Kelce couldn't hold their smiles and burst out laughing at their father's advice shortly later. The ex-Eagles center further confessed how Ed's advice ""definitely encouraged"" him to get rid of his shyness and be more confident in approaching girls during his bachelor years.

The Kelce brothers hopped on the stage at the ""Amazon Port"" panel, flaunting their stylish outfits. Jason wore a special cartoon-themed outfit, which he was sure his daughters would appreciate. Giving his four daughters an adorable shout-out for inspiring his special outfit, Jason said: ""It's Father's Day, so I figured I'd embrace my inner child. My girls would appreciate this outfit, for sure."" As for Travis, the Kansas City Chiefs star wore an outfit worth $2770, which included luxurious brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton. Before attending the festival in his cartoon-themed outfit, Jason went viral for recreating a Travis and Taylor Swift picture. Feedback Why did you not like this content?

myiswji,2025-06-18 21:22:51,en,REDDIT,"  Not even close to too late, dude. Sorry, just entering your second act, you're still expected to do stuff 😁. So let's look at your issues: So, first thing I would suggest is reviewing this bullshit job situation you have going on. You work for the government, the main benefit should be that you don't have to work that hard. If once in a while you have to work long hours, that's part of being a salaried employee. If you are *routinely* working very long weeks, that's something you need to be talking about regularly with your supervisor. You should be doing quarterly reviews, bring this up. *Express your dissatisfaction*. Politely, but do it. You're a professional with a valuable skill, not some kid at a checkout counter. They want you there and they ABSOLUTELY don't want you leaving. Government hiring blows. What's your commute like...not just in time, but driving? For example, could you do an extra 10 minutes of driving but spend it going down beautiful country roads instead of stuck in traffic on the highway? Regardless, you need to accept that for the immediate future, unless something a lot better comes along, you're going to be doing this commute. You need  a mindset where this is YOUR time, something you look forward to instead of something you dread. Take a little extra time in the morning to fix yourself a fancy coffee in a to-Go cup, buy some good audio books. Make yourself delicious breakfast burritos to eat on the way. Get those little massage bead seat covers that truckers love. Keep your car clean, and smelling good. You will be spending 2 hours a day sitting here. Find a way to make that work for you. Maybe you get a good voice to text app and dictate your novel, maybe you listen to all the classical music you never listened to before. Maybe you listen to lectures on history or sermons or whatever makes you happy. But remember *this is not a commute*. It is two hours in a comfortable chair. Make it work for you. Next is your health, if you're having trouble dating is it because you're overweight? Work on that if you need to. But if you're otherwise healthy, try going to a gym regularly. Good way to meet people and lose stress. Id take a look at your overall financial situation, make sure you're saving for retirement and whatnot. But if you make good money and get those state benefits, you should be Gucci for a while. So that's health and work and money. Let's talk about your personal life. Even if it's a shallow dating pool, you need to put yourself out there little bit, to at least get your feet back in the water. Not saying you need to marry these women! But you can sure as fuck make out with some tubby bitch in the parking lot. It'll do a lot for your self esteem. Next: *you don't live with your mother. * Even if you DID livd in her house, that would be fine and a sensible move to save money in this economy. *But you don't live with your mother* **You live in your own house. ** Don't frame it that way even to yourself. If you go out on a date and the subject comes up, simply talk about how great it is that you can be nearby to help take care of your mother as she ages. Doesn't matter if your mother is a youthful 50, the point is to frame it so that you're a good son who loves his mother, instead of the way you're framing it to yourself as a loser.

On Wednesday, Ed appeared on the Kelce brothers' 'New Heights' podcast and recalled sharing relationship tips with Jason during one segment. Ed Kelce started by explaining how Jason came to him during his school years, seeking advice on ""what to talk about"" with girls. Recalling the advice that Ed gave him, the father-of-two said (Timestamp: 48:27): Moving forward, Ed explained how the key to getting girls interested in someone is to ""shut up and get them to talk about themselves, and you ain't gotta say another word."" Nevertheless, according to Ed, what men should do instead is: Jason and Travis Kelce couldn't hold their smiles and burst out laughing at their father's advice shortly later. The ex-Eagles center further confessed how Ed's advice ""definitely encouraged"" him to get rid of his shyness and be more confident in approaching girls during his bachelor years. On Monday, Jason Kelce traveled to France to attend the Cannes Lions Festival with brother Travis Kelce. The Kelce brothers hopped on the stage at the ""Amazon Port"" panel, flaunting their stylish outfits. Jason wore a special cartoon-themed outfit, which he was sure his daughters would appreciate. Giving his four daughters an adorable shout-out for inspiring his special outfit, Jason said: As for Travis, the Kansas City Chiefs star wore an outfit worth $2770, which included luxurious brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton. Before attending the festival in his cartoon-themed outfit, Jason went viral for recreating a Travis and Taylor Swift picture."

Andy老師與家寧分手後，雙方隔空開撕，因公司帳目、逃漏稅等問題而對簿公堂，12日雙方剛開完庭。 如今Andy老師的美女經紀人李郁涵經營自創的家居品牌LEMUSÉE卻遭爆賣的都是大量淘寶貨，官網甚至販售真狐狸毛、兔毛等皮草，其中一款甚至是「珍稀白狐狸毛」，與李郁涵標榜品牌「永續環保」理念，以及Andy簡單質樸的人設完全背道而馳。 ▲照片上45公分見方的抱枕，至少需要兩隻以上精挑細選的小動物全身完整皮毛才能製成。 翻攝LEMUSÉE官網
根據《鏡報》報導，LEMUSÉE官網時發現商品項目繁多，其中抱枕、蓋毯產品強調使用「稀有的真狐狸毛皮」、「真兔毛」製成，售價都很貴，從新台幣2880元、6880元，乃至13800元的「撞色真兔毛皮草床尾巾」等。 而近年來，「禁用動物皮草」早成為國際共識，Gucci、Prada、Burberry等指標性時尚品牌自2017年起便陸續宣布全面停止使用真皮草。 尤其從狐狸與兔子身上取得毛皮的過程，手段極為殘忍。 舉例來說，Andy經紀人李郁涵賣的一個45公分見方的狐狸皮草抱枕，至少需要精挑細選兩隻小動物的完整皮毛才能製成。 對此動保團體「台灣動物社會研究會」副執行長陳玉敏也表示遺憾：「我們接觸過許多KOL都非常愛護動物。 若他們先前不知情，現在知道了，是否能夠主動下架產品？ 希望他們可以運用自身影響力，為反皮草及動物保護議題發聲，我們樂意提供相關資料與合作支持。」 更多三立新聞網報導

With Ridley Scott Taking The Director's Chair, The Film's Premise Follows Patrizia Romancing Maurizio & Marrying Her Way Into The Fashion Label. Maurizio's Family Business Holds Little Charm For Him & The Power Is Held By His Dad & Uncle. If Patrizia Wanted The Glory, She'd Make The Family Into Enemies With 1 Another.

Jus'. . Huh? Even Scenes Without Patrizia Struggle. Maurizio's Death Takes Too Long As The Ending Glosses Over The More Interestingly Bizarre Aspects Of The Crime.

1lezecj,2025-06-19 02:19:11,en,REDDIT,"  Been apart of this sub for a long while now but never commented on my devil corps experience, but had some time today. This will be kind of a long read. If you're new to a devil corps i encourage you to read this so you can spot the red flags as well. And those that have been in one of these offices before, I know you can relate. A very very very small percentage of owners are actually making decent money. Probably about 1% if I had to guess, maybe less. I worked for a devil corp for about two months before I could see past all the smoke and mirrors and got the hell out of there. At first, the owner of the office I worked for appeared to be rich, I was totally fooled. She would Chanel and Gucci, and would carry herself to a very high standard. She was educated and well traveled. She lived near the office in a very very expensive beach area. She never once went out to the field, but would instead just be at the office at the start and at the end of the day (or so I thought). I figured she was pulling in some serious cash. One thing I always found weird though was that she didn't own or drive a car, but would instead uber everywhere. She lived in NYC for a long time and said that she would never own a car because she was a New York girl who never drove. Made sense to me at the time, but we live in Los Angeles, where having a car is undoubtedly beneficial. And if one truly makes all this money, why would you not have a car? Our office was a pretty big building, and consisted of a handful of other offices and owners as well. There was one owner in particular who was seen as the big boss amongst all the other owners. People always bragged about him having a Tesla, and his Gucci suits and shoes. He was well spoken and never had to hit the field as well. I was blinded by all this at first and was definitely drinking the kool aid. Come to find out, my owner was dating AND living with the owner I just mentioned. I thought that was weird, especially considering that appearance wise, my owner was totally out of this guys league. This was when the door to reality started to open for me, and I started drinking less kool aid, and paying more attention to things. As the weeks went by and I started getting more and more atmosphere meetings under my belt, I started to notice that this guy really only had a couple of suits. That Ferragamo belt of his that had me in a chokehold to pursue this dead end career, turned out to be the same one, day in and day out. And his Tesla? It had a massive door sized dent that never seemed to get repaired. This is when I really started questioning things. Why are these two even dating? And if they are truly this power couple making all this money, why are they living in an apartment and not a house? Why doesn't this guy have more suits or get his car fixed? And why does my owner do most of her shopping at H&M instead of high end boutique shops at the Beverly center like I thought she did? Why don't they ever take time off to travel or enjoy any of the fine dining LA has to offer? And why doesn't she have a car? Truth is, they weren't making all this money they said they were. They made about the same as any other average LA couple and even though they didn't hit the field, they worked twice the hours as a person with a normal job. They were actually in the office all day everyday, often times on Sunday as well which was our only off day. All these things were true with the higher ups as well. I remember the video call meetings with regionals. Why were these people always in their car instead of a nice office? I remember one “big shot” regional guy was bragging about how he just bought a house and was in his home office, but it was apparent his office was in the attic and he was hunching over during this meeting because he was a taller guy and was in this small ass attic. And the few times I saw this, he was always wearing the same suit with the same LV tie. It's not hard to spot holes in these people's stories. They are just so good at manipulating and talking that most people are blind to it. But if you open your eyes, it's all right there for you to see. For the large large majority, there's no real money in this twisted game. And those that do rake it in, it never lasts, and always ends bad. If you made it this far, thanks for reading my experience with devil corps."

Simbolo di ribellione, poi caposaldo dello streetwear anni 2000, epoca d'oro delle capsule collection co-ed, le sneakers firmate hanno segnato un'era. Averne almeno un paio, meglio se limited edition, era un passaggio obbligato per entrare a far parte del linguaggio globale della moda. E tra tutte, le sneakers Gucci sono diventate un codice silenzioso ma inconfondibile: minimaliste ed eleganti, ma anche chunky e irriverenti. Mai banali. A testimoniare l'impatto culturale di queste calzature, la recente citazione nella mini serie Amazon Prime Sorelle sbagliate, dove le sneakers Gucci si trasformano nel simbolo per eccellenza dell'alta società americana, segno riconoscibile di un'élite. Una storia iniziata già nel 1977 con il primo modello, le Tennis (giustamente chiamate così) da Gucci, che vedevano un mix di materiali, tela e pelle, svettante una doppio “G”. Le sneakers Gucci Ace Bianche, in pelle liscia, con la fascia bicolore verde e rossa che attraversa il lato: le Gucci Ace - risalgono al 2016 - sono state (e sono ancora) una dichiarazione di stile. Poi sono arrivate le varianti gioiello, con perle applicate e l'iconica ape dorata sul tallone: un'ossessione per fashion insider e It girls, viste da Soho a Tokyo, da Copenhagen a Milano. Ogni stagione le reinventa, ma l'essenza rimane: una sneaker che non vuole passare inosservata, pur mantenendo una linea pulita e sofisticata. Alessandra Ambrosio indossa le sneakers Gucci BG004/Bauer-Griffin La nuova edizione delle Tennis 1977 Le Gucci Tennis 1977 sono una di quelle silhouette senza tempo: un perfetto equilibrio tra heritage sportivo e savoir-faire artigianale italiano. Nate nel 1977 come sneakers da tennis in tela, leggere e versatili, sono state a lungo uno dei modelli più iconici – ma sottilmente sottovalutati – dell'archivio Gucci. Il loro primo grande ritorno avviene proprio nel 1997, esattamente vent'anni dopo il debutto, con un rilancio che omaggiava il gusto retrò anni Settanta e il lifestyle da country club: linee essenziali, dettagli in gros grain e l'inconfondibile fascia Web nei toni verde e rosso a decorare i lati. Il risultato? Una sneaker vintage nel DNA, ma decisamente contemporanea nello spirito. Ma è sotto la direzione creativa di Alessandro Michele che le Gucci Tennis 1977 hanno vissuto il loro momento d'oro. Nel 2020, in pieno revival rétro e con l'estetica eccentric-chic tipica del designer romano, il modello viene riportato in passerella e subito adottato da fashion editor, collezionisti e celebrità. La nuova versione ha mantenuto l'identità originale, con tomaia in tela (anche in GG Supreme o in denim), suola in gomma naturale, profili in contrasto e il dettaglio ""Gucci Tennis 1977"" impresso sulla linguetta e sul bordo interno. Dakota Johnson con le sneakers Tennis di Gucci Christopher Peterson / SplashNews.com / ipa-agency.net Le sneakers adidas Gucci Non sono mancate le collaborazioni, diventate veri cult. Indimenticabile quella con adidas sotto la direzione creativa di Alessandro Michele (collezione Gucci autunno inverno 2022 2023): un incontro tra heritage e ironia, tra sport e barocco. Da questo sodalizio è nata l'interpretazione più creativa delle sneakers, con un colpo di genio – e di archivio – che ha riportato alla ribalta un modello dimenticato per anni: le adidas Samba (seguito dalle Gazelle). L'estetica retrò, i colori saturi e una nuova allure luxury le hanno rese nuovamente protagoniste, tanto da rimanere ancora oggi tra i modelli più cercati sul mercato secondario, con quotazioni che sfiorano il collezionismo. Indimenticabile è il look di Gigi Hadid con le sneakers Gucci rosa in collab con adidas, che la ritrae mentre ritira della pizza d'asporto. Gigi Hadid con le sneakers Gucci adidas Gucci autunno inverno 2022 2023 Le sneaker Gucci minimal luxury (l'idea con cinturino alla caviglia) Anche Sabato De Sarno, nel suo debutto per Gucci con la collezione primavera estate 2024, ha scelto le sneakers per chiudere il suo primo look in passerella. Un dettaglio non casuale, riconfermato anche nella primavera estate 2025, che parla di una nuova visione: minimalismo nei volumi e nei capi, lusso sussurrato nella forma ma urlato negli accessori. Le sneakers, ancora una volta, diventano il simbolo di uno status, quello di chi può scegliere la semplicità solo dopo averla decostruita. Gucci primavera estate 2025 Le sneakers Gucci con cinturino alla caviglia Quali saranno le prossime sneakers Gucci? Ora l'attesa è tutta rivolta a Demna Gvasalia, pronto a reinterpretare l'universo Gucci con la sua visione tra streetwear e couture.

mov_CF8296DEFE5BE6D47CEEECA1DDB4A2AE,2025-06-19 05:36:02,en,WEB,"  Piaget's new 'Sixtie' watch rides against traditional watch silhouettes, riffing on feminine codes from the 1960s to offer new curves and contours In landscapes dominated by the usual, circular suspects – and the occasional octagonal flex – Piaget's new 'Sixtie' landed at Watches & Wonders this year with a bang. It wasn't a rectangle. It wasn't a square. It wasn't an oval. In fact, the Sixtie's silhouette was so radical that it took watch editors a moment to work out what it actually is; the cogs turning as we mentally harked back to junior school shape-sorting blocks. A trapezoid?! Close enough. Like a breath of fresh, fashion-infused air, the Sixtie tells a story of late-'60s glamour, and Piaget's fearlessness in blurring the line between horology and high fashion. For many maisons, the 1960s and '70s were the golden age of contemporary watch design, it was the era that gave birth to the first Daytona, Carrera, Royal Oak and Nautilus – virtually all the big hitters that still reign supreme as the most covetable timepieces to date. Watches were evolving from functional objects into design statements, and the wider world of style and art were beginning to extend their infl uence – it was in the 1960s that Andy Warhol became a notable Piaget collector and tastemaker. It is the asymmetry, bold textures and unusual silhouettes of this era that have informed the Sixtie, which feels unapologetically avant-garde. Its curved contours actually come straight from the Piaget archive, inspired by the 21st Century Collection from 1969, which ushered in a new design DNA for the house, as it looked to the runways of Paris Fashion Week for inspiration for the first time. Softened edges and polished hardstones became part of the Piaget vocabulary, and the Sixtie interprets these influences with retro flair – the Sixtie is available with a bold turquoise dial, as well as a classic mother-of-pearl watch face, and we expect many more colourful iterations to come. 16Arlington, Dior, Ferragamo, Chloé How to wear the Sixtie? At just 6.5mm thick, it's thinner than most vintage bangles and slips under a silk cuff like a secret – let it peep from Acne's black dress with blousy sleeves, which can be dressed up or down with heeled sandals by Khaite or cowboy boots by Ganni. While its rose gold gleam gives contemporary classicism, the Sixtie's off -kilter character requires a little extra pizzazz to make it feel at home, so pick a bold accent colour to liven up your look. We suggest lime – an uplifting jolt of jazziness for summer black, channelled by Pucci sunglasses and Chanel's mint and lime tweed bag. If you're an incurable magpie, you might be tempted to load diamonds alongside the Sixtie, but we think it looks chicer when sitting solo against a bare skin – simply stack the other wrist with bangles to play to its vintage glamour, such as Tom Ford's ready-made duo, and add echoes of summer upon the ears with Jacquemus' sunflower earrings. The Sixtie is such a chameleon that it can just as easily be worn shoreside as it can be in the city – pair it with a print bikini and beaded cap to escape to the coast, and let loose your inner hippie.

mov_38D5C8C3C0AACBFF45CE561D369E7710,2025-06-19 08:00:57,en,WEB,"  Scotland's first black supermodel discusses why she chose to lead a double life in her career for 20 years. For years, Eunice Olumide MBE was a dual force in opposing industries. She was known for gracing the covers of Vogue and runways of Gucci, but out of the spotlight, she was rapping alongside the world's biggest hip hop stars. The 37-year-old supermodel, activist and Star Wars actress is bringing her hidden past to light in her directorial debut Secret Lives, which tells the untold history of British hip hop. Olumide sat down with PA to share why now is the time she's decided to open up. “In 2023 I was presenting a TV show called Edinburgh Unlocked and at the same time I released this EP,” says Olumide, who was rapping under a pseudonym. “A journalist who worked for The Sun had this EP come across his news desk and he recognised that it was me by my voice. It blew his mind.” She pauses, “I pleaded with him not to run the story [about my double life] and just to run a story on the EP, which thankfully, he eventually did.” It's the kind of media entanglement most celebrities dread, but for Olumide, it was a tipping point. “Social media was and is becoming bigger and bigger,” she says, “and so I was just really conscious that this was going to come out. So either I talk about it myself, or I let someone else talk about it who might not do it justice.” Secret Lives was her answer. A documentary that traces the overlooked pioneers of UK hip hop, and her own decision to remain anonymous in the scene, even as her name rose in fashion. “I really wanted to create a competing ideology,” she explains, “to prove that you could do music and be successful as a female artist without putting your body first.” At just 15, Olumide was discovered by a scout from a local modelling agency while shopping in Sauchiehall Street, Glasgow. It was at this age that she also released her first single. By 17, she was touring and rapping with legends like Mos Def, Damian Marley, Lauryn Hill and Wu Tang. “What I learned early on […] from major record labels that wanted to sign me was that, as a woman, it was not possible for me to retain my creative control and my intellectual property,” she says. “Unless I conformed to a different way of representing myself.” That way of representing herself was through sexualisation, which she didn't believe was relevant to her music. It was a jarring parallel, in one world, modelling was offering her money for her image, and in many ways, hip hop was demanding the same. “I deliberately separated them,” she says. “I didn't want anyone to say, 'She's only successful in music because she's a model.'” And so her solution was to wrap up and shut down. “I was always like, scarfed up, hooded up, sunglasses – looking as unattractive as possible,” she laughs. “Promoters, managers, labels – they could not understand it and did not like it at all.” Despite the pushback, her musical peers respected it. “People respected me because I had a reputation for my music and nothing else,” she says. She fondly recalls how Busta Rhymes once introduced her as “my little sister, like, she's a G.” But Olumide's choice to remain anonymous didn't mean she wasn't a mainstream success. Back in 2010, she performed at one of the world's biggest music festivals. “Playing at Glastonbury as a hip-hop band was just unheard of,” she says, “so you know that was such an incredible experience and I kind of feel like at such an early age, [myself, Jamal Edwards and Liam Tootill from SBTV] achieved so much.” But the drive behind her film Secret Lives runs deeper than recognition. It's about preserving a history on the verge of being forgotten. “There are documentaries saying that hip hop started in 2002 just because that's how far back Google goes,” say Olumide, quoting fellow rapper and comedian Ben Bailey Smith (Doc Brown), who also appears in the film. “My thing was about creating an archive of history – British history – that's important to all of us.” The film touches briefly on her story, including a moment where old collaborators react to learning she worked in fashion. “Literally one or two people in the UK and one or two people in the US knew,” she says. One of the few who didn't need telling was the late British designer Vivienne Westwood. “She had an ability to read people,” says Olumide, “so it wasn't something I needed to articulate.” She credits Westwood as a kindred spirit – someone battling the same contradictions between art and commercial success, as she navigated being a climate activist in the fashion industry. “She loved me to bits,” Olumide smiles simply. And while fashion had its contradictions, it was a career that gave her indispensable tools too. “I got a lot out of fashion – it's one of the only industries in the world where women get paid more,” she points out, “and definitely it's less discriminatory based on class.” It also gave her the confidence to present herself in ways she now finds empowering. “I don't think I'd know how to present myself now, other than the obvious hyper-sexualised woman, if I hadn't worked in fashion.” But playing these varying characters for runways, cover shoots and campaigns didn't seep into her life outside of work. “I don't feel like I present myself as different characters. I feel like I'm just me and I just make art,” she says, “but I think fashion gives me the ability to represent myself to other people in a way that they can articulate and understand.”..."

One of the few who didn't need telling was the late British designer Vivienne Westwood. “She had an ability to read people,” says Olumide, “so it wasn't something I needed to articulate.” She credits Westwood as a kindred spirit – someone battling the same contradictions between art and commercial success, as she navigated being a climate activist in the fashion industry. “She loved me to bits,” Olumide smiles simply...."

mov_79CDFC67AE0D0ACB43C0FC81141CF352,2025-06-19 11:51:00,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]Poche ore dopo aver annunciato la nomina di Luca de Meo, ceo di Renault, a numero uno del gruppo Kering, l'erede del colosso del lusso in crisi di velocità ha inoltrato a dipendenti e azionisti alcune osservazioni. Queste Sullo stesso argomento: Dicono in Kering che François Henri Pinault e Luca de Meo, nuovo ceo del gruppo, si siano piaciuti subito, al primo incontro. Nessuno sa se abbiano parlato di automobili, alle quali, peraltro, il manager milanese cresciuto nel team di Sergio Marchionne, poi artefice del rilancio di Seat e dell'eccezionale recupero di Renault, ha dedicato un “Dictionnaire amoureux” un annetto fa, edito da Plon.  Il dizionario è stato tradotto anche in spagnolo, ma ne trovate la pubblicità principalmente su Amazon.fr con la seguente recensione: “Dalla A di Abarth alla Z di Generazione Z, passando dalla R di robot alla S di Senza Patente, Luca de Meo, pdg di Renault, racconta l'incredibile storia dell'automobile, un argomento popolare che suscita grandi passioni”. Mancando la moda ultimamente di entrambi questi valori, la popolarità e la passione, è relativamente facile spiegarsi perché i Pinault, messi nella necessità di trovarsi un nuovo amministratore delegato perché l'erede del fondatore, François Henri, dopo vent'anni alla guida ne aveva dichiaratamente abbastanza, e i due deputy ceo, Francesca Bellettini e Jean Marc Duplaix, evidentemente non hanno dato in questo anno e mezzo la prova necessaria per togliere dal proprio titolo la deminutio “deputy”, abbiano deciso di guardare fuori dal solito circolo, out of the box come dicono quelli che sanno l'inglese, finendo per ingaggiare questo manager di gradevole aspetto, cosa che nel settore offre sempre una chance in più, e che sarà stato certamente innamorato dell'auto, ma non abbastanza da rifiutare la carica di vertice nella gestione di alcuni fra i marchi più favolosi del mondo, in crisi di velocità come Gucci ma anche provvisti di buona tenuta di strada come Balenciaga, Bottega Veneta e Pomellato: se il gruppo ha chiuso il 2024 con ricavi a 17,2 miliardi di euro, a meno 12 per cento, e un utile di 1,13 miliardi, in decremento del 62 per cento, il maggiore imputato dell'imponente calo è senza dubbio il marchio fiorentino.  Leggi anche: le dimissioni                          A fine 2024 Kering aveva debiti per 10,5 miliardi di euro e secondo fonti Reuters rischia il terzo declassamento del rating nel giro di tre anni.  In Francia, la notizia del cambio di corsia di de Meo non ha lasciato indifferente nessuno, soprattutto perché Renault, con lo Stato francese al 15 per cento del capitale, è un simbolo politico, e De Meo lascia mentre il piano strategico “Futurama” è in fase di definizione. La sua uscita, in un'Europa automobilistica in crisi, con l'elettrico al 15 per cento e molte pressioni causate dal rafforzamento della Cina e dai dazi Usa, rischia di rallentare il distacco da Nissan e il rilancio delle auto economiche. La notizia dell'arrivo di de Meo è iniziata a circolare nella serata di domenica, mentre i milanesi erano raccolti al Teatro alla Scala ad ascoltare Kirill Petrenko che dirigeva una eccezionale Prima Sinfonia di Brahms.  La mattina dopo, alla conferma, il titolo Renault è crollato dell'8,69 per cento: il gruppo automobilistico, oggi certamente più solido rispetto al 2020, continua però ad aver bisogno di un leader che ne rafforzi il processo di innovazione. Il che, disgraziatamente, è proprio quello di cui ha bisogno anche Kering: non solo di sistemare i conti, vendendo le attività non più utili e fruttifere e mettendo pesantemente mano anche al personale, tutte attività che un professionista estraneo alle infinite relazioni incrociate interne al settore può compiere certamente senza timori, ma anche ridare di slancio e visione al gruppo.  Non è la prima volta che i Pinault scelgono un manager estraneo alla moda; le stesse reazioni che ora accompagnano la nomina di de Meo si produssero nel 2004 quando Robert Polet, capo della divisione gelati e frozen foods di Unilever, nato e cresciuto in Asia, venne chiamato a sostituire Domenico De Sole al vertice di Gucci. Il “gelataio di Kuala Lumpur”, come venne inevitabilmente subito ribattezzato, in realtà fece molto bene per quasi un decennio e fino all'arrivo di Patrizio Di Marco. E un percorso molto simile, sebbene partendo da posizioni meno rilevanti, è stato quello di Pietro Beccari, attuale ceo di Louis Vuitton, entrato nel 2006 nel gruppo Lvmh dalla divisione haircare del gruppo Henkel come vicepresidente esecutivo marketing e comunicazione, prima di diventare presidente e ceo di Fendi nel 2012 e di Christian Dior Couture nel 2018. Evidentemente, François Henri Pinault deve aver pensato che replicare quei successi sia possibile, anche in un contesto di mercato completamente diverso.  Lo ha anche scritto, in una nota diffusa fra i collaboratori che, pur evidenziando l'ottimo lavoro fatto dai due “deputy”, che hanno “implementato cambi significativi, rafforzando la nostra capacità di azione ad ogni livello” ha messo in chiaro come si sia reso necessario separare le due funzioni di presidente e ceo, “identificando i potenziali candidati” per quest'ultima funzione, affidando il compito non a una ma a ben due società di ricerca (una di queste è stata Jouve).  “Cercavamo un manager di grande esperienza”, anche “internazionale”, “con una visione fresca sul settore e sul nostro gruppo in particolare”. Che, al di là delle precedenti considerazioni, nessun manager della moda  sia stato ritenuto all'altezza del compito dovrebbe far riflettere. "

Personal luxury goods sales that eroded to 364 billion euros ($419 billion) in 2024 are projected to slide by another 2% to 5% this year, the study said, citing threats of U.S. tariffs and geopolitical tensions triggering economic slowdowns. “Still, to be positive in a difficult moment — with three wars, economies slowing down, inequality at a maximum ever — it's not a market in collapse,'' said Bain partner and co-author of the study Claudia D'Arpizio. “It is slowing down but not collapsing.” Alongside external headwinds, luxury brands have alienated consumers with an ongoing creativity crisis and sharp price increases, Bain said. Buyers have also been turned off by recent investigations in Italy that revealed that sweatshop conditions in subcontractors making luxury handbags. Sales are slipping sharply in powerhouse markets the United States and China, the study showed. In the U.S., market volatility due to tariffs has discouraged consumer confidence. China has recorded six quarters of contraction on low consumer confidence. The Middle East, Latin America and Southeast Asia are recording growth. Europe is mostly flat, the study showed. This has created a sharp divergence between brands that continue with strong creative and earnings growth, such as the Prada Group, which posted a 13% first-quarter jump in revenue to 1.34 billion euros, and brands like Gucci, where revenue was down 24% to 1.6 billion euros in the same period. Gucci owner Kering last week hired Italian automotive executive Luca De Meo, the former CEO of Renault, to mount a turnaround. The decision comes as three of its brands — Gucci, Balenciaga and Bottega Veneta — are launching new creative directors. Kering's stock surged 12% on news of the appointment. D'Arpizio underlined his track record, returning French carmaker Renault to profitability and previous roles as marketing director at Volkswagen and Fiat. “All of these factors resonate well together in a market like luxury when you are in a phase where growth is still the name of the game, but you also need to make the company more nimble in terms of costs, and turn around some of the brands,'' she said. Brands are also making changes to minimize the impact of possible U.S. tariffs. These include shipping directly from production sites and not warehouses and reducing stock in stores. With aesthetic changes afoot “stuffing the channels doesn't make a lot of sense,'' D'Arpizio said. Still, many of the headwinds buffering the sector are out of companies' control. “Many of these (negative) aspects are not going to change soon. What can change is more clarity on the tariffs, but I don't think we will stop the wars or the political instability in a few months,'' she said, adding that luxury consumer confidence is tied more closely to stock market trends than geopolitics. President of Italian luxury brand association Altagamma Matteo Lunelli underlined hat the sector recorded overall growth of 28% from 2019-2024, “placing us well above pre-pandemic levels.” While luxury spending is sensitive to global turmoil, it is historically quick to rebound, powered by new markets and pent-up demand. The 2008-2009 financial crisis plummeted sales of luxury apparel, handbags and footwear from 161 billion euros to 147 billion euros over two years. The market more than recovered the losses in 2010 as it rebounded by 14%, with an acceleration in the Chinese market. Similarly, after sales plunged by 21% during the pandemic, pent-up spending powered sales to new records."

Puskar) MILÁN, Italia (AP) — Las ventas globales de bienes personales de lujo están ""desacelerándose pero no colapsando"", según un estudio de la consultora Bain & Co. publicado el jueves. Las ventas de bienes personales de lujo, que se redujeron a 364.000 millones de euros (419.000 millones de dólares) en 2024, disminuirán otro 2% a 5% este año, según el estudio, citando amenazas de aranceles de Estados Unidos y tensiones geopolíticas que desencadenan desaceleraciones económicas. ""Aún así, ser positivo en un momento difícil —con tres guerras, economías desacelerándose, la desigualdad en su máximo histórico— no es un mercado en colapso"", indicó Claudia D'Arpizio, socia de Bain y coautora del estudio. ""Se está desacelerando pero no colapsando"". Aparte de los vientos en contra externos, las marcas de lujo han alienado a los consumidores con una crisis de creatividad y fuertes aumentos de precios, declaró Bain. Los compradores también se han desanimado por investigaciones recientes en Italia que revelaron condiciones de explotación en subcontratistas que fabrican bolsos de lujo. Las ventas están cayendo drásticamente en los mercados poderosos de Estados Unidos y China, mostró el estudio. En Estados Unidos, la volatilidad del mercado debido a los aranceles ha desalentado la confianza del consumidor. China ha registrado seis trimestres de contracción debido a la baja confianza del consumidor. El Oriente Medio, América Latina y el sudeste asiático están registrando crecimiento. Europa está mayormente plana, mostró el estudio. Esto ha creado una marcada divergencia entre las marcas que continúan con un fuerte crecimiento creativo y de ganancias, como el Grupo Prada, que registró un aumento del 13% en los ingresos del primer trimestre a 1.340 millones de euros, y marcas como Gucci, donde los ingresos cayeron un 24% a 1.600 millones de euros en el mismo período. El propietario de Gucci, Kering, contrató la semana pasada al ejecutivo automotriz italiano Luca De Meo, ex CEO de Renault, para llevar a cabo una recuperación. La decisión se produce mientras tres de sus marcas —Gucci, Balenciaga y Bottega Veneta— están lanzando nuevos directores creativos. Las acciones de Kering se dispararon un 12% con la noticia del nombramiento. D'Arpizio subrayó su historial, devolviendo a la rentabilidad al fabricante de automóviles francés Renault y sus roles anteriores como director de marketing en Volkswagen y Fiat. ""Todos estos factores resuenan bien juntos en un mercado como el de lujo cuando estás en una fase donde el crecimiento sigue siendo el objetivo, pero también necesitas hacer que la empresa sea más ágil en términos de costos y dar la vuelta a algunas de las marcas"", sostuvo. Las marcas también están haciendo cambios para minimizar el impacto de posibles aranceles de Estados Unidos. Estos incluyen el envío directo desde los sitios de producción y no desde almacenes, y la reducción de existencias en las tiendas. Con los cambios estéticos en marcha, ""llenar los canales no tiene mucho sentido"", dijo D'Arpizio. Aún así, muchos de los vientos en contra que afectan al sector están fuera del control de las empresas. ""Muchos de estos aspectos (negativos) no van a cambiar pronto. Lo que puede cambiar es más claridad sobre los aranceles, pero no creo que detengamos las guerras o la inestabilidad política en unos pocos meses"", afirmó, agregando que la confianza del consumidor de lujo está más estrechamente ligada a las tendencias del mercado de valores que a la geopolítica. El presidente de la asociación italiana de marcas de lujo Altagamma, Matteo Lunelli, subrayó que el sector registró un crecimiento general del 28% de 2019 a 2024, ""colocándonos muy por encima de los niveles prepandémicos"". Si bien el gasto en lujo es sensible a la agitación global, históricamente se recupera rápidamente, impulsado por nuevos mercados y demanda acumulada. La crisis financiera de 2008-2009 hizo caer las ventas de ropa, bolsos y calzado de lujo de 161.000 millones de euros a 147.000 millones de euros en dos años. El mercado más que recuperó las pérdidas en 2010 al rebotar un 14%, con una aceleración en el mercado chino. De manera similar, después de que las ventas cayeron un 21% durante la pandemia, el gasto acumulado impulsó las ventas a nuevos récords.

So let me break it down real slow for you, since clearly no one ever handed you a fucking fact sheet. Medicaid fraud? Yeah, it exists—but it's not your imaginary EBT warriors rolling up in BMWs. The real grift comes from providers—those sketchy-ass clinics and doctors overbilling for bullshit services. And the “dead people” myth? That's not some welfare zombie apocalypse—it's outdated databases, bureaucratic delays, not a nationwide scam operation. SNAP? Same bullshit trope. Most recipients are working families, disabled people, kids, and seniors. Not freeloaders in Gucci tracksuits loading lobster into Teslas. And the USDA itself says most fraud comes from retailers and identity theft, not people hustling the system for snack money. But here's where it gets hilarious—because you just admitted something you clearly didn't mean to. By whining about abuse in these programs, guess who you're actually accusing? Yep—your own FUCKING damn red-state MAGA base. Because who gets the lion's share of Medicaid, SNAP, and federal aid? Red states. The ones that voted overwhelmingly for the ORANGE TACO INFLAMED HEMORRHOID in Chief. So by your own logic, it's your people doing the “scamming.” The welfare moochers you're railing against? They're wearing red hats and chanting “Trump 2024.” Isn't that fucking ironic? You're not calling out Democrats—you're dragging your own party through the mud and too damn brainwashed to realize it. Meanwhile, you still haven't refuted a single point I made: ✔️ Red-state Republicans are terrified to cut Medicaid and SNAP because their voters need it to survive. ✔️ Blue-state Republicans are sweating bullets over SALT caps that would screw their taxpaying base. ✔️ None of your rant touched any of that—because you've got nothing. Just a regurgitated MAGA bedtime story from 1994. So let me spell it out again: you're not debating. You're flailing. And you're accidentally admitting that your own base is the one sucking up the benefits while screaming about socialism. Now that's rich. Almost as rich as the fake welfare queen in the Range Rover you keep dreaming about. What a dumfuck -"

I've taken her to the vet about 6 months ago with her late sister due to the respiratory issue of coughing after barking or being excited. The vet had already let me know that it's most likely a collapsing trachea since her heart sounds good and normal. I've gotten some organic cough syrup on Amazon and purchased a air purifier to maybe help with the coughing.

mov_7BC3AEFE9D6F3E35A2C6E94139A9ED0D,2025-06-19 18:00:48,en,WEB,"  luxury Market Faces headwinds: Disillusionment and Declining Engagement The global luxury market is experiencing a notable slowdown, a situation not seen since the financial crisis of 2008-2009, with the exception of the pandemic-induced dip in 2020. Recent analysis indicates a challenging period ahead, driven by a complex interplay of economic pressures, geopolitical instability, and a growing disconnect between luxury brands and their consumers. A Shift in Consumer Sentiment Beyond macroeconomic factors like fluctuating currencies and rising geopolitical tensions, a core issue is emerging: luxury consumers are increasingly disillusioned. The rapid price increases implemented post-pandemic have disrupted the conventional value proposition of luxury goods, leaving many questioning the justification for escalating costs. This isn't simply about affordability; it's about perceived value. As one industry expert noted, consumers struggle to reconcile substantial price hikes with a lack of demonstrable innovation. For instance, a handbag that previously retailed for $1,200 now costing $2,000 feels disproportionate without a corresponding leap in design or craftsmanship. this sentiment is especially pronounced among younger demographics, who are ofen the driving force behind luxury trends. They are more attuned to authenticity and value, and less willing to accept price increases that aren't supported by genuine innovation. This shift in mindset is contributing to a broader trend of emotional detachment from luxury brands. Declining Market Numbers & Consumer base The impact of this disillusionment is reflected in recent market performance. The luxury market saw a 1% decline to $418 billion (€364 billion) in 2023 at current exchange rates, remaining flat when adjusted for constant rates. More significantly, the luxury consumer base has shrunk. Over the past two years,the market has lost approximately 50 million customers,bringing the total estimated number of luxury consumers worldwide down to 353 million from 400 million in 2022. This isn't merely a temporary pause in purchasing; it represents a genuine alienation from the industry. Engagement with luxury brands is waning across all demographics, not just aspirational buyers. Data reveals a concerning trend: brand-related searches have decreased by over 40%, and social media follower growth has plummeted by a staggering 90%. These declines are directly linked to price fatigue and a perceived lack of creative momentum. In 2024, preliminary data suggests this trend is continuing, with some brands reporting double-digit declines in key product categories. The Creative Director Carousel & Its Consequences The luxury industry's reliance on artistic creativity is being undermined by frequent changes in leadership.A high rate of turnover among senior executives and creative directors is creating instability and hindering the development of cohesive brand narratives. While these transitions might potentially be largely invisible to the average consumer, the effects are palpable. The period between creative director appointments can be particularly damaging. brands may lack a clear creative vision during this time, resulting in collections that feel uninspired or derivative. This lack of innovation further fuels consumer disillusionment. Consider the recent changes at brands like Gucci and Burberry; while intended to revitalize the brands, the transitions have created periods of uncertainty and impacted sales figures. A recent report by McKinsey indicated that brands experiencing creative leadership changes saw an average 5% dip in brand equity within the first year. Reorienting Towards Timelessness & Value In response to these challenges, many luxury brands are re-evaluating their strategies. Ther's a growing emphasis on timeless design and enduring quality, rather than fleeting trends. Brands are attempting to justify their price points by focusing on craftsmanship, heritage, and the longevity of their products. Though, simply emphasizing timelessness isn't enough. Brands must also demonstrate a commitment to innovation and creativity. This requires investing in design talent, exploring new materials and technologies, and fostering a culture of experimentation. Furthermore, brands need to be transparent about their pricing strategies and clearly communicate the value proposition of their products. The future of the luxury market hinges on its ability to reconnect with consumers, address their concerns, and deliver experiences that are both aspirational and meaningful. A return to genuine creativity, coupled with a renewed focus on value, will be crucial for navigating the current headwinds and securing long-term success. The Shifting Sands of Luxury: A market in Transition The global luxury market is undergoing a meaningful recalibration, marked by a complex interplay of economic headwinds and evolving consumer sentiment. A recent report by Bain & Company highlights a period of “far-reaching disruptions,” yet also acknowledges the industry's inherent resilience. However, simply relying on past successes won't suffice; luxury brands must adapt to a new landscape demanding sharper focus, cultural relevance, and purpose-driven growth. Profitability under Pressure: The Impact of Strategic Shifts A key trend reshaping the luxury sector is a intentional pullback from multi-brand retail platforms.Over 70% of luxury houses are reducing their volume through these channels, a move driven by factors like increased tariffs, decreased foot traffic in traditional retail spaces, and a slowdown in new product launches. While these decisions may initially impact overall revenue, the effect on profitability is disproportionately positive. “These shifts have a noticeable impact on the topline,but an even greater one on the bottom line and EBIT,” explains federica levato,a partner at Bain. this suggests brands are prioritizing margin protection over sheer volume,focusing on channels where they have greater control over brand presentation and pricing. This strategy is particularly relevant given the current economic climate, where further price increases are becoming increasingly challenging to justify.For example, brands like Chanel and hermès have already implemented multiple price hikes in recent years, and further increases risk alienating even their most loyal customers...."

No more 96 fake profiles of one CEO— Truth would be the only name platforms show. If I was the President… $9,000 a month would be your floor, Not a ceiling.

Books, puzzles, merchandise, All connected with love, Because the economy Isn't numbers alone— It's people, it's presence, it's purpose. Cybersecurity? That would be my first law. The economy would not glitch When real lives are at stake. Electric systems wouldn't be hijacked By corporate greed or carelessness— They'd be honored as lifelines. And our carbon footprint? It would finally feel light, Because the Earth, like us, Deserves to breathe right. If I was the President… No child would be raised in fear...."

2029eff558ba912dda92b79f3665d455,2025-06-20 04:52:00,et,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[et]Kuulsused 'See kaalub üles igasuguse raha, mida keegi saab mulle anda': enne Denis Villeneuve'i keeldus Nicolas Winding Refn Daniel Craigi 880 miljoni dollari suurusest James Bondi filmist pärast kultusklassikaliseks režissööriks saamist Nicolas Winding Refn ja Daniel Craig? See lavastaja-näitleja duo oleks võinud olla reaalsus, kui asjad oleksid läinud teisiti. Refn defineerib sõna auteur ja ta sobib pigem indie-filmide maailma kui Hollywoodi sädelevatesse telkidesse. Ta tungis kultusklassikuga stseeni Sõida (2011) ja tegi seejärel sarnaseid filme Ainult Jumal andestab (2013) ja Neoondeemon (2016). Kuid nagu iga uue ja uudse filmiga stseeni tormava režissööriga sageli juhtub, pakuti Refnile ka suuri filme. Üks neist oli Daniel Craigi 880 miljonit dollarit teeniv James Bondi film, Tont . Suur režissöör aga keeldus sellest, sest teadis, et Bond pole tema jaoks. Miks Nicolas Winding Refn keeldus Daniel Craigi filmi lavastamast? Tont ? Intervjuus ajalehele The Telegraph Nicolas Winding Refn paljastas, et pidas läbirääkimisi James Bondi filmide tegijate Eon Productionsiga Daniel Craigi jaoks. Tont . Kuid mitme kohtumise jooksul mõistis režissöör, et teda pole pandud juhtima sellist kinnisvara nagu James Bondi, ja tal oleks parem teha oma asju. Ta ütles: 'Ma lihtsalt tean, et nii saan teha kõike, mida tahan, ja see kaalub üles igasuguse raha, mida keegi saab mulle anda.' Loe rohkem : 'Hey you, f*ck you': James Bondi staari Daniel Craigi esimene suhtlus oli Batmani staari Anne Hathaway jaoks alandav Kuid juba 2016. aastal oli ta endiselt seotud spioonimaailmaga, kuna töötas koos James Bondi kirjanike Neal Purvise ja Robert Wade'iga spioonipõneviku pealkirjaga. Kättemakstav vaikus . Kokkuvõte kõlas: “ Endine Euroopa spioon võtab vastu Prantsusmaale pagendatud Jaapani ärimehe konfidentsiaalse missiooni, et võtta maha Jaapani kõige reetlikuma Yakuza bossi pea. See film aga ilmavalgust ei näinud. Taani režissööri populaarsus on aastate jooksul langenud, kuigi ta tegi filme tippstaaridega nagu Tom Hardy. Bronson (2008). Kuidas ta siis end ülal peab, kui ta ei asu telgivarrastele? Siis oli Refn selgitanud, et see kõik oli tänu reklaamide juhtimisele sellistele ettevõtetele nagu Gucci, H&M ja palju muud. Loe rohkem : 'Ma olin täiesti šokeeritud ja löödi jalaga äärekivile': erinevalt Daniel Craigist oli Pierce Brosnan vihane sellest, kuidas ta James Bondist lahkus Kes on James Bondi järgmine? Pärast seda, kui Nicolas Winding Refn James Bondi projektist lahkus, võeti Sam Mendes lavastajaks Tont (2015). Kuid sellest ajast ja järgmisest Bondi filmist on möödunud aastaid, Pole aega surra (2021), autor Cary Fukunaga, nägi Daniel Craig lahkuda populaarsest spioonifrantsiisist. Sellest ajast peale on olnud intensiivseid spekulatsioone selle üle, kes võiks endale võtta maailma kuulsaima spiooni mantli. Nimed nagu Henry Cavill , Idris Elba, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Tom Hardy ja paljud teised. Kuid sellistelt produtsentidelt nagu Michael G. Wilson ja Barbara Broccoli pole järgmise James Bondi kohta ametlikku teavet tulnud. Loe rohkem : 'See ei tulnud kõne alla': Daniel Craig oli valmis riskima tohutu 85 miljoni dollari suuruse James Bondi palgaga, keeldudes ühest olulisest muudatusest oma välimuses Kui Broccolile anti 2022. aastal BFI stipendium, küsiti temalt järgmise Bondi filmi kohta ja ta ütles: 'Me töötame välja, kuhu temaga minna, räägime sellest läbi. Stsenaariumi pole ja me ei saa seda välja mõelda enne, kui oleme otsustanud, kuidas järgmisele filmile läheneme, sest tegelikult on see Bondi taasleiutamine. Me leiutame uuesti, kes ta on ja see võtab aega. Ma ütleks, et filmimiseni on jäänud vähemalt kaks aastat. Sellisena tundub, et ametlik teade on veel vähemalt poolteist aastat möödas. Jääb üle oodata, kes valitakse, sest nii James Bondi pärandi kui ka Daniel Craigi mantli edasikandmist on raske võrrelda. Tont on saadaval Amazon Prime Videos. Allikas : Telegraaf"

myrputi,2025-06-20 06:40:50,en,REDDIT,"  I will say that 2 things are completely true: 1. the glazing for Tom Cruise can get super unbearable most of the time, yes he deserves his props but my god people. 2. I don't think it's too much to say that Top Gun: Maverick saved theaters, or at the very least it was the ultimate final confirmation that theaters are still here to stay for a little while longer. Because the thing is it's true that Godzilla vs Kong, Spider-Man, hell even Shang-Chi, A Quiet Place, No Time To Die, Venom, and F9 are the true saviors that stuck their necks out at the end of the day. However, the problem was those movies were young skewing (No Time To Die was the only exception) franchise flicks that was always going to be fine for the most part, but almost nobody didn't know if Top Gun had the same juice… until it did. Older skewing movies were not doing that great or they were just bombing left and right, The Last Duel, Steven Spielberg's West Side Story, only No Time To Die and House of Gucci (mainly thanks to Lady Gaga's star power) both managed to barely break even, but by COVID standards they were great performances. There was a genuine fear that the older audience would NEVER come back to the movie theater, until the great trifecta happened (Sandra Bullock's The Lost City, Top Gun: Maverick, and Elvis). The Lost City brought some of the older crowd back along with majority of the women demographic, and it also proved that rom-coms could still play in theaters rather than just streaming and that people were hungry for more, then comes Top Gun coming out swinging with a generational old-school blockbuster run that truly had everyone everywhere talking about the movie. It effectively gave WB the confidence that Elvis will perform big after all and which it did. So yeah, Maverick gets all the credit and while I just explained why it was truly the perfect storm of all of these films combined, I will still give Tom credit where credit is due because I am not a fan, but I adore Top Gun and I admire how he held onto the movie away from streaming until it was the right time to release it. And it effectively saved theaters because it mostly stopped studios from dumping perfectly good movies on streaming due to whatever worries they had (when again millions of folks literally risked Omicron just to watch Spider-Man), and now you were a loser if your movie went straight to streaming lol. No seriously after Top Gun, I can't remember the last time any of those people has brought up the “importance of the theatrical experience” until that movie."

tw_sl_9dc070cb018728c2482b68a9a1e9b0fc,2025-06-20 09:45:50,en,WEB,"  “I love that we're popping your cherry,” laughs Jodie Comer, as I take my seat opposite her at a press junket for the hotly anticipated 28 Years Later, the second sequel to director Danny Boyle's genre-defining masterpiece 28 Days Later. I've unwisely confessed that this is my first 'IRL' junket, and Jodie, despite being in the middle of a hectic press day, is doing a magnificent job of putting me at ease. Styled by Danielle Goldberg, Jodie is wearing a pre-fall 2025 Gucci jumpsuit and looks a million miles away from Isla, her frayed, emotionally-disturbed character in 28 Years Later. The film is set in 2030, 28 years after a virus was accidentally unleashed in the UK, infecting the population with uncontrollable, murderous rage. We first meet Isla, Jodie's character, on Lindisfarne, a tidal island off the northeast coast of England, where she lives with her husband, Jamie (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), and son, Spike (Alfie Williams), as part of a tight-knit community of survivors. Throughout the film, Jodie looks “sweaty and rough,” as described by the film's makeup supervisor, Flora Moody, who, for what it's worth, adds, “It's very hard making Jodie look rough!” Isla has a mysterious illness, one that causes immense headaches, confusion, and paranoia. There are no doctors on the island, so Isla's symptoms remain untreated – a source of anguish for her family, especially son Spike, who goes to extreme measures to seek medical care for his mother. “We were able to sit with Alex Garland and Danny Boyd (the respective screenwriter and director of 28 Years Later) and go through the script and create our own little histories of what the relationship to the island was, when Spike came along, and then get up on our feet,” Jodie tells me, reflecting on the charged family dynamic she created with Aaron and Alfie. “Danny had all the props from the house, he had a bed in the rehearsal room, and then we could block scenes out and get in the bed, get under the cover and play around and be silly.” 28 Years Later is actor Alfie Williams' big-screen debut, a colossal achievement for the 14-year-old from Gateshead. “I think we both felt protective of Alfie, especially Aaron,” Jodie tells me. “Aaron had a lot of stunt rehearsals and stuff (with Alfie), so they spent even more time together. It was just important for him to feel comfortable. “From the moment I met Alfie, he seemed to have such an instinct, a confidence and a fearlessness, actually, which I was like, 'Wow', I'm inspired by that. I want to harness some of that for me.” Before Isla's character really gets going, you'd be forgiven for thinking 28 Years Later sets up its stall as a coming-of-age reckoning solely between father and son. Not the case. When Spike gets wind of a doctor on the mainland, he lures his mother away from the island towards the dangerous hellscape of infected England, where, amongst other threats, they must reckon with the 'Alpha infected', AKA 'zombies' with a penchant for ripping off their victims' heads and using their blood-soaked spines as weaponry. Despite the ghoulish subject matter, the atmosphere on set was one of positivity. “I'm a silly person,” Jodie laughs, adding, ""So I think when we weren't rolling, it wasn't like the set was kind of heavy in any way. “That's another thing I've learned from working with Danny: he leads such a beautiful, calm, and playful set. He's incredibly personable. Everything is a conversation and is out in the open. There is no reason for it to be any other way.” She continues, “Some people have certain processes, but I'm a big believer that I don't think your process should inflict any sort of pain on anyone else or make anyone else feel uncomfortable or delay a process. You know what I mean?” One of Jodie's most memorable scenes in 28 Years Later comes early on, involving a screaming match between her and on-screen husband Aaron Taylor-Johnson. How does she prepare for a scene like that? How does she conjure up rage on demand? “So on day one, I'm screaming at Aaron. I'm like, 'I'm so sorry we've only just met, but this is the way it is,'” laughs Jodie. She praises Danny Boyle for running certain scenes together, allowing her to get further into character and “get to a point where that rage is present”, while the first scene takes place. “It's funny,” she continues. “I find it hard to analyse afterwards. I feel like you're always just trying to be in the moment of it. But I can't say I've screamed at many people like that in my life. So it was kind of nice to try it out.” We discuss female fear and how it has evolved – both in society and within the 28 franchise – since the release of the first film in 2002. I ask about Jodie's relationship to fear; how does she reflect it within her characters? “I'm sure there are depths of fear that I've never ever experienced before,"" Jodie starts. “But I always feel like there's a challenge within fear, and I'm thinking now in regards to roles and what I choose, and that I usually feel that over the other side of fear is growth, a reckoning or a realisation. And so I'm always trying to dare myself to go there.” Last year, I attended a screening of Prima Facie, the play written by Suzie Miller, which explores how Tess, a defence barrister played by Jodie, reckons with the traumatic aftermath of being raped. Granted, no one is infected with the 'rage virus' in Prima Facie, but its themes of fear and survival are just as potent as in 28 Years Later. “I feel very blessed,” says Jodie, reflecting on Prima Facie. “I feel like playing Tess, there's so much of my own fear that I was kind of confronted with in that, that I've been able to face and to turn into something else.” TikTok content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. To absolutely no one's surprise, Jodie has already received critical acclaim, not to mention Oscar buzz, for her standout performance in 28 Years Later...."

mystcq2,2025-06-20 12:23:08,en,REDDIT,"  A lot of you may get mad at me for saying this but Data Engineering attracts many people because of the perception that DE is easier than SWE. While that's certainly true at many large companies like Meta or Amazon where you're basically slinging SQL and little else, it's most certainly not true at companies like Capital One or Airbnb or Netflix; there, your job is practically 1:1 with software engineering. That being said, a great percentage of DE's need to study DSA, time/memory complexity, and CS fundamentals, instead of memorizing frameworks and assuming everything's Gucci. To provide an actual metric that illustrates what I mean: at a company I will not name, I encountered a legacy process that took 55 hours but was reduced to 6.5 seconds, as well as ~5x less memory allocation, simply by using Aho-Corasick instead of regex, parallelization instead of serialization, and basic optimizations using concepts like “tidy data” and sets. That's the difference between throwing SQL at everything and knowing when certain tools and techniques apply best or worst."

Increasingly‭, ‬it is about how we spend our time‭, ‬where we linger‭, ‬and what we‭ ‬taste‭. Across the world‭, ‬fashion houses are transforming the dining landscape‭, ‬turning cafés‭, ‬restaurants‭, ‬and patisseries into‭ ‬the new catwalks of culture‭. From the white-gloved sophistication of Café Dior in Seoul to the buzzing energy of Prada Caffè at Harrods‭, ‬luxury labels are now offering curated culinary experiences‭, ‬each stamped with the same design precision and aspiration that made them global icons‭. Recommended For You The world's finest chefs are donning creative director hats‭, ‬and the runway is extending to the dinner table‭. Welcome to the new frontier‭ ‬of luxury‭, ‬where Michelin meets maison‭. From Couture to Culinary The idea isn't new‭. Ralph Lauren's Polo Bar in New York has long blended fashion and dining‭. But today's renaissance‭, ‬led by brands like Dior‭, ‬Prada and Gucci‭, ‬is on another level entirely‭. Dior's Paris flagship now houses the elegant Monsieur Dior Restaurant‭, ‬where dishes are plated with the same artistry as couture gowns‭. Prada's acquisition of Milan's Pasticceria Marchesi 1824‭ ‬resulted in cafés where mint green interiors and velvet seats create an atmosphere as rich as its espresso‭. Gucci Osteria‭, ‬under Michelin-starred chef Massimo Bottura‭, ‬offers high fashion on a plate in Florence‭, ‬Beverly Hills‭, ‬Seoul and‭ ‬Tokyo‭. Dishes like Parmigiano foam and gourmet burgers capture the maison's playful spirit‭. Why Fashion Brands Are Dining Out In a post-pandemic world‭, ‬experiences matter more than possessions‭. Dining offers tactility‭, ‬time‭, ‬memory‭. A handbag may get you‭ ‬likes‭, ‬but a lunch at Tiffany Blue Box Café gives you a story‭. LVMH leads this charge with culinary activations‭. The Tiffany Blue Box Café in New York serves afternoon tea in robin's-egg-blue settings‭, ‬a modern nod to Breakfast at Tiffany's‭. Such experiences extend brand value‭, ‬increase dwell time‭, ‬and attract younger audiences‭. Suddenly‭, ‬a‭ ‬€20‭ ‬signature cake at Milan's Cova Montenapoleone can deliver the same luxury thrill as a‭ ‬€5,000‭ ‬handbag‭. Pop-Up Cafés and Passport Moments Pop-up cafés are turning fashion weeks and summer destinations into tasting experiences‭. Miu Miu's roving cafés in Paris‭, ‬Shanghai‭, ‬and Amalfi offer playful brand immersion through gingham cushions‭, ‬pastel espresso machines‭, ‬and runway-inspired staff‭. Jacquemus‭, ‬the darling of digital-age minimalism‭, ‬created Café Citron and Oursin in Paris with Caviar Kaspia‭. Every plate evokes‭ ‬the designer's dreamy Provencal world‭. Bulgari extends luxury lifestyle through its hotel restaurants in Milan‭, ‬Dubai‭, ‬Tokyo‭ and London‭, ‬where caviar and fine Italian design blend seamlessly‭. Dubai‭: ‬Where It's All Coming Together Dubai is an epicentre for this movement‭, ‬blending fashion‭, ‬food‭, ‬and architecture in spectacular ways‭. At Dubai Mall‭, ‬shoppers can now indulge at the Tiffany Café‭, ‬where robin's-egg blue walls‭, ‬jewel-inspired desserts‭, ‬and signature lattes elevate afternoon tea to an event‭. Local retailers are following suit‭. DIFC and Jumeirah concept stores now blend cafés with curated fashion‭, ‬knowing that today's customer values experience as much as the product‭. When Chefs Become Creative Directors Chefs are now fashion collaborators‭. Massimo Bottura with Gucci‭. Jean Imbert with Dior‭. Alain Ducasse with LVMH‭. And most recently‭, ‬Chef Gaggan Anand's collaboration with Louis Vuitton in Bangkok‭. At Gaggan at Louis Vuitton‭, ‬a 17-course spectacle sees edible monograms and dishes echoing LV's heritage‭. It's molecular gastronomy meets maison luxury‭, ‬performance art disguised as dinner‭. LV's choice of Gaggan‭, ‬a rebel of Indian fine dining‭, ‬signals the brand's embrace of bold‭, ‬immersive experiences‭. Luxury at 30,000‭ ‬Feet‭: ‬Airport Cafés Take Off Luxury cafés are now landing in airports‭. Louis Vuitton has launched cafés at Doha's Hamad International Airport and London Heathrow‭. At Doha‭, ‬travellers sip single-origin coffee under gold accents‭. At Heathrow‭ ‬Terminal 5‭, ‬LV's café offers branded pastries and cappuccinos‭, ‬turning layovers into luxury moments‭. Airports‭, ‬with their captive‭, ‬high-spending audience‭, ‬are ideal for brands to blend retail with refined respite‭...."

mov_EC0EB9A70881C07FC8E639BC6472DA2B,2025-06-20 15:06:09,en,WEB,"  The online ire over the initial peeks at Ryan Murphy's upcoming series about the tragic love story of John F. Kennedy Jr. and Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy is a case study on why it's important to get costuming right on TV. Never has so simple an outfit caused such an uproar. Last weekend, a first look at Ryan Murphy's upcoming series “American Love Story,” set to focus on the romance between the late John F. Kennedy Jr. and his wife Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, who died in a plane crash in August 1999, dropped online. Actress Sarah Pidgeon, who is set to portray Bessette-Kennedy, was pictured in a number of outfits that, at first glance, seemed reminiscent of looks that are routinely referenced by designers and dissected on social media: A brown leather coat, a black Hermès Birkin bag, a white button-down tucked into a pair of kick flare denim, accessorised with a tortoiseshell headband. But the near-instant online consensus was that the execution was way, way off. “GOD AWFUL STYLING. START OVER COMPLETELY,” one commenter wrote on Instagram. “Her wardrobe is historic. Please source it correctly,” added another. “CBK's fans want to support this movie, but you have to get the clothes right.” Criticism wasn't reserved just for the clothes: Brad Johns, Bessette-Kennedy's hair colourist, told Vogue that the platinum blonde shade Pidgeon sported was “totally wrong.” Many social media users argued that the photos showed a version of minimalism that felt like it could have been plucked off the rack at Zara in 2025, encouraging the costume designers to source archival pieces for a more authentic look. And because CBK's wardrobe was so simple, prioritising sharp tailoring and high-quality fabrics over trends, without any embellishments to hide behind, poorly-made imitations are obvious. Fan outcry shouldn't completely dictate decisions, for the simple reason that nuance is often lost online. Murphy, for example, told Variety earlier this week that the images were simply camera tests, released to ward off paparazzi from stalking the set, and weren't representative of what Pidgeon would actually be wearing in character. But the size of the reaction underscores just how important it is to get costuming right today. While the conversation certainly contributes to buzz around the show, it's also put off Bessette-Kennedy's most devoted fans, who the production will need to build hype before it premieres on Valentine's Day next year. “Love Story” was inevitably going to be the source of online conversation fodder, thanks to its near-perfect timing. Not only has there been a recent resurgence of interest in the couple, the rise in “quiet luxury” and minimalist fashion in particular has reignited interest in Bessette-Kennedy's — CBK to her fans — style. A publicist for Calvin Klein during the brand's heyday, she's long been regarded as the platonic ideal of 1990s fashion, remembered for her affinity for designers like Prada and Yohji Yamamoto and her ability to make anything, from her sleek Narcisco Rodriguez wedding gown to the L.L. Bean boat and totes she carted around Martha's Vineyard, feel chic. Today, designers like Carolina Herrera's Wes Gordon cite her as a muse; on TikTok, a new generation born after her death has more recently fallen in love with her style. Her wardrobe is easily recognisable and often imitated, but because the famously press-shy Bessette-Kennedy did no formal interviews, her clothes were also her primary form of communication with the public. You can't tell her story without the visuals that go along with it. Costumes play a hugely important role in developing a show's inner world, but they're especially important when the project in question is about a person, or even a period in history, that's synonymous with a certain look. “Mad Men,” for instance, channeled the 1960s not just through period-appropriate suits and dresses, but also countless little details, from jewellery to hats and hairstyles. That attention to detail helped develop the story and turn the show into a cultural phenomenon, with countless blogs and books devoted to dissecting each episode's style choices. Love Story's ambitions are in some ways greater than Mad Men's: Not only is it set during a distinct period in sartorial history, but unlike Mad Men, it's recent enough for most viewers to clearly remember, and is about real people to boot. It's a challenging assignment, but not an impossible one. Much of the final two seasons of Netflix's “The Crown” centred on Princess Diana. Costume designers Amy Roberts and Sidonie Roberts put Elizabeth Debicki and Emma Corrin, the actresses who played the royal, in near-exact recreations of some of Diana's best-remembered looks, including her so-called “revenge dress” and her mockneck Harvard sweatshirt and bike shorts. Doing so helped bring her character to life and gave the entire production a realistic feel. Still, costume designers shouldn't feel they must stick exclusively to recreations. Part of the appeal of these shows is that viewers get a chance to see an imagined version of the moments in their lives that weren't photographed. Finding new looks that feel true to the time and the person is equally important. “Love Story” has only just started filming, so there's still time to course correct. In looking to get it right, costume designers should not just go for run-of-the-mill minimalism, but CBK's distinct flavour of it. Murphy, for his part, told Variety that he's assembled a 10-person “style advisory board” to consult on the fashion, and they already have plenty of 1990s Prada bags and Manolo Blahniks available. There are plenty of connoisseurs available to consult, from those operating accounts dedicated to Bessette-Kennedy's style on Instagram to author Sunita Kumar Nair, who spent years researching the very topic for her 2023 book “CBK: Carolyn Bessette Kennedy: A Life in Fashion.” As well, her well-documented love of certain designers can provide a strong starting point. Working more formally with Calvin Klein, for instance, would make sense on both sides — the show could tap the brand's archive for historically-accurate pieces, while the brand could get a marketing boost as it continues the revival of its Calvin Klein Collection label. Doing so can help provide credibility: For its series “The New Look” about the life of Christian Dior, Apple TV worked with Dior on the costumes, gaining access to the house's archives. Though the show received criticism, the clothes were a high point. At the very least, scouring The RealReal's selection of vintage Prada is a good place to start. THE NEWS IN BRIEF FASHION, BUSINESS AND THE ECONOMY Kering shares surged as Renault CEO became set to join for its turnaround. Stock rose 8.3 percent in early Paris trading as the Gucci owner prepared to appoint Luca de Meo as its next CEO, with Francois-Henri Pinault reportedly remaining as chairman. US retail sales posted their biggest drop in four months. Despite the 0.9 percent decline in overall retail sales last month, clothing sales rose 0.8 percent.

Flaunting thongs was the fashion power move in 2023, thanks in no small part to the Y2K style resurgence and its most fervent ambassadors such as Dua Lipa and Hailey Bieber. In recent years, however, celebs' lingerie preferences have changed. The likes of Dakota Johnson and Florence Pugh began rejecting the pro-chafing propaganda and, instead, wearing the stringy item's polar opposite: comfortable, roomy, and covered granny panties. The latest adventurous icon to trade her butt-baring underpinnings for your gran's fave was Elsa Hosk. Elsa's Teeny Lace Mini Hosk stays abreast of the buzziest trends as a tastemaker and ready-to-wear entrepreneur. She does, after all, consistently release drops through Helsa Studio that tap into current tastes. On Wednesday, June 18, the model proved she knows her fashion ABCs by rocking a look straight from the archives — Gucci's Spring/Summer 1996 collection, to be exact. She wore a lacy LBD with a micro mini hemline, long sleeves, and an empire cut, a piece she got from vintage e-tailer Vestiaire. She captioned the look with the triumph of a thrift shopper who knew she scored. “There's something special about wearing a piece with a story,” she wrote on Instagram. To this day, Tom Ford's reign at Gucci remains one of the most iconic eras of the brand, and his collections are some of the most coveted (read: expensive). The dress, for example, is going for $8K on another website. Her Granny Undies Surprise Though coquettish, the lacy babydoll dress was also spicy thanks to its see-through fabrication. Hosk leaned into the peekaboo effect and paired the look with a pair of vibrant leaf-green granny panties that popped underneath the delicate fabric. The color choice was far from random, of course. Together with the outfit, Hosk shared a photo of her styling reference, a 1996 Gucci campaign with a similar lace LBD styled with green undies (it was inspired by a runway look worn by a young Kirsty Hume from the same season.) Hosk accessorized the look with relatively simple, stringy all-black adornments. She wore a string bolo tie knotted as a choker. The thin strands were mirrored on her feet with her strappy heeled sandals. She completed the outfit with black sunglasses and a messy updo cinched by a claw clip, proving that the hair accessory can be chic. Her style remains unmatched.

You can't get rid of Hamas, which is deliberately hiding behind civilians, without harming civilians. And no, it's not evil, because Israel isn't going after these civilians, but rather after military targets, and that's just war. In war, there's collateral damage - there hasn't been a war in history without it. But equating Israel and Hamas because Arabs are dying *because Hamas is using them* is willful blindness. Israel attacks military targets and tries to minimise civilian casualties; Hamas attacks civilians and tries to maximise civilian casualties. Do you see the difference here? >Zionist support idea that we should establish Israel as a Jewish Ethno State. The fact that they supply the water doesn't hold much weight here. In my view, Israel never had the right to the area to begin with. Crazy religious people think Jewish people are entitled to it because of the Bible. Now the cat's out of the bag, isn't it? Israel never had the right to the land, and so the corollary is what, that acts of terror against it are justified? And no, nobody is entitled to the land because of the Bible; the Bible just documents the Jews' historical connection to the land. The real justification for the state of Israel is that the international community voted to grant the Jews independence once British imperialism withdrew from the area, and this independence was declared on land that the Jews had bought. This was a national project, not a religious project, just as the independence of Algeria was a national project, the independence of India, and so on. There were many nations that were formed at the end of the imperial era, but of course it's only the Jews declaring independence in their ancestral homeland on lands that they purchased that you condemn. But no, that's not what it looks like, right? >Netanyahu's war crimes I talked about. Give me a specific example, as I've debunked the hospitals and schools thing. >What violence did Mahmoud Khali participate in? Firstly this is a red herring. My point is that these ""protesters"" have been, on the whole, violent. Were some of them coincidentally less violent? Yes. But that doesn't invalidate my point. Now, regarding this guy, he's an instigator (and far from a moral paragon) and the US should absolutely kick him out for that. You don't get to sow discord in a country in which you're a guest, regardless of whether you're violent or not. I don't know the other lady but I'd be very surprised to learn there's any meaningful difference between these two good-for-nothings. >I don't discard economic growth, I just care more about the people Ok? And in practice what does that translate to? What's the policy behind the cliché? >What I am against is 8 people holding the same wealth as half of the global population. And your suggested policy? Mine is: don't interfere. Yes, some people are immeasurably rich, but why should I care? >Bezos has treated his workers like absolute shit. Have you heard the stories of Amazon workers having to piss in bottles to get all their deliveries made on time? Coincidentally, I've worked in an Amazon fulfilment centre, so I can attest first-hand to how this doesn't reflect Amazon's policies or the situation on the ground. You're always allowed to take restroom breaks, as long as you meet your daily expected targets, and workers are generally happy and glad to be working for Amazon. If anything, they continuously ask for more hours per month and are happy to come to work, because they're well compensated and treated. I'll also tell you an anecdote about my time there, because my impression is that some workers are just zany. In fulfilment centres, there's something called ""picking"" - it's the role of going through the warehouse and putting things in your trolley to send it for shipping. The average worker picks about 400 items a day, and the target is lower than that, say about 300. It depends on the site. Anyway there was this one worker who had set himself the goal of picking a minimum of 1,000 items per day, and he did this consistently. Nobody asked him, he wasn't paid more per hour, and nobody would have fired him for doing the minimum. He just wanted to do more...."

Federal prosecutors say that for decades, Combs abused, threatened and coerced women to participate in drug-fueled marathon sexual encounters called ""freak offs"" and used his business empire, along with guns, kidnapping and arson, to conceal his crimes. The defense has argued that the encounters were consensual, and Combs has denied any wrongdoing. The 55-year-old hip-hop mogul is facing five criminal counts: one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion, and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted, he could face life in prison. Here are some key takeaways from Friday's testimony culled from various reporters and news organizations in the courtroom, including , , and . Former assistant says Combs once fired him for forgetting his fanny pack Paul testified after invoking his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Judge Arun Subramanian signed an immunity order compelling Paul's testimony. He told the court that he worked for Combs from 2022 until 2024, describing the grueling 80-to-100-hour weeks he spent helping coordinate the mogul's travel, fitness workouts, meal plans and assorted other needs, including setting up hotel rooms for ""freak offs"" — or what he knew as ""wild king nights"" — ahead of Combs's arrival. Like other former assistants, Paul said he would stock the rooms with supplies, including candles, condoms, Astroglide and a Gucci pouch that contained drugs. He also sometimes cleaned the rooms after the sex parties, he said. Paul testified that he would sometimes go days without sleep working for Combs, taking prescription Adderall and occasionally cocaine to stay awake. According to Paul, Combs likened his staff of assistants to SEAL Team 6, demanding they operate with no failures. Paul said that Combs “fired” him numerous times, including once for forgetting to bring his boss's Lululemon fanny pack. The firings would always blow over within a day or two and he would continue working, he said. Paul testifies that he bought drugs for Combs — but he was no 'drug mule' Paul testified that he was also tasked with buying drugs — including marijuana, cocaine, ketamine and ecstasy — for Combs. Combs or one of his other assistants would instruct him to obtain the drugs, which involved meeting with drug dealers with such nicknames as Guido, Baby Girl and One Stop, Paul said. Paul told the court that he would also pick up prescription drugs for Combs at pharmacies under Combs's real name or the alias ""Frank Black."" Once he procured the drugs, Paul said he would give them directly to Combs or put them in Combs's Gucci bag, where they were often stored. But under cross-examination by the defense, Paul testified that handling drugs was only a minor part of his work for Combs, and that it was his understanding that the drugs were for the mogul's personal use. “You were not some drug mule, right?” defense attorney Brian Steel asked. “Absolutely not,” Paul replied. Ex-assistant says he was arrested with cocaine he found 'sweeping' Combs's room Paul was arrested for possession of cocaine at Miami-Opa Locka Executive Airport in March 2024, around the same time federal agents raided Combs's homes. The charges were later dropped. He told the court that he got the cocaine while he was ""sweeping"" Combs's room and put it in his own bag, but then forgot to remove it before leaving for a family trip. “I was sweeping his room and put it in my bag and forgot it while I was packing,” he explained. Paul said he told law enforcement that everything in the bag, including the cocaine, was his, and did not say where he got it out of ""loyalty"" to Combs. Big picture: Prosecutors hope to convince jurors that Combs used his business empire, including assistants like Paul, to procure drugs and help him set up ""freak offs"" as part of their racketeering conspiracy charge. But under cross-examination, Paul acknowledged that Combs did not ask him to travel with the cocaine, and that he had left it in his bag by mistake. Ventura text Combs: 'You treat me like a hooker to be honest' While Joseph Cerciello, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, was on the stand, prosecutors entered into evidence text messages between Combs and Cassie Ventura, his former girlfriend and a star witness for the government's case. The messages were from March 2017, a year after Combs was captured on surveillance video assaulting Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel. ""That's not love, that's possession,"" Ventura wrote to Combs in one of the messages, which was shown in court. At one point, Combs asked Ventura if she was ""flipping"" on him. She said she “aint flipping” but that she also did not want to subject herself to another “beat down.” Later in the exchange, Ventura told Combs, “You treat me like a hooker to be honest. You always want to call one and you have one. This hooker has been here for 10 years.” Defense says it will take less than 2 days to present its case Prosecutors had hoped to rest their case this week, but the court was adjourned without testimony Wednesday because a juror was sick with vertigo, delaying the proceedings. Court was not in session Thursday for the Juneteenth holiday. The government said it now expects to wrap up its case Monday. Combs's lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, estimated it would take less than two days to present his defense, and likely rest on Tuesday or Wednesday. (The defense had already hinted that Combs probably won't testify.) Under that timeline, Subramanian said jury deliberations could begin Thursday after closing arguments, and asked both sides to prepare modifications to the proposed instructions that will be given to the jury when it gets the case."

Paul said he told law enforcement that everything in the bag, including the cocaine, was his, and did not say where he got it out of ""loyalty"" to Combs. Big picture: Prosecutors hope to convince jurors that Combs used his business empire, including assistants like Paul, to procure drugs and help him set up ""freak offs"" as part of their racketeering conspiracy charge. But under cross-examination, Paul acknowledged that Combs did not ask him to travel with the cocaine, and that he had left it in his bag by mistake. Ventura text Combs: 'You treat me like a hooker to be honest' Cassie Ventura testifies about bruises she says she received from Combs at his sex trafficking trial on May 14. (Jane Rosenberg/Reuters) While Joseph Cerciello, a special agent with Homeland Security Investigations, was on the stand, prosecutors entered into evidence text messages between Combs and Cassie Ventura, his former girlfriend and a star witness for the government's case. The messages were from March 2017, a year after Combs was captured on surveillance video assaulting Ventura in a Los Angeles hotel. ""That's not love, that's possession,"" Ventura wrote to Combs in one of the messages, which was shown in court. At one point, Combs asked Ventura if she was ""flipping"" on him. She said she “aint flipping” but that she also did not want to subject herself to another “beat down.” Later in the exchange, Ventura told Combs, “You treat me like a hooker to be honest. You always want to call one and you have one...."

mov_F9F4B2C2C139D68175DADEB0B8FC82C6,2025-06-20 17:57:07,en,WEB,"  Flaunting thongs was the fashion power move in 2023, thanks in no small part to the Y2K style resurgence and its most fervent ambassadors such as Dua Lipa and Hailey Bieber. In recent years, however, celebs' lingerie preferences have changed. The likes of Dakota Johnson and Florence Pugh began rejecting the pro-chafing propaganda and, instead, wearing the stringy item's polar opposite: comfortable, roomy, and covered granny panties. The latest adventurous icon to trade her butt-baring underpinnings for your gran's fave was Elsa Hosk. Elsa's Teeny Lace Mini Hosk stays abreast of the buzziest trends as a tastemaker and ready-to-wear entrepreneur. She does, after all, consistently release drops through Helsa Studio that tap into current tastes. On Wednesday, June 18, the model proved she knows her fashion ABCs by rocking a look straight from the archives — Gucci's Spring/Summer 1996 collection, to be exact. She wore a lacy LBD with a micro mini hemline, long sleeves, and an empire cut, a piece she got from vintage e-tailer Vestiaire. She captioned the look with the triumph of a thrift shopper who knew she scored. “There's something special about wearing a piece with a story,” she wrote on Instagram. To this day, Tom Ford's reign at Gucci remains one of the most iconic eras of the brand, and his collections are some of the most coveted (read: expensive). The dress, for example, is going for $8K on another website. Her Granny Undies Surprise Though coquettish, the lacy babydoll dress was also spicy thanks to its see-through fabrication. Hosk leaned into the peekaboo effect and paired the look with a pair of vibrant leaf-green granny panties that popped underneath the delicate fabric. The color choice was far from random, of course. Together with the outfit, Hosk shared a photo of her styling reference, a 1996 Gucci campaign with a similar lace LBD styled with green undies (it was inspired by a runway look worn by a young Kirsty Hume from the same season.) Hosk accessorized the look with relatively simple, stringy all-black adornments. She wore a string bolo tie knotted as a choker. The thin strands were mirrored on her feet with her strappy heeled sandals. She completed the outfit with black sunglasses and a messy updo cinched by a claw clip, proving that the hair accessory can be chic. Her style remains unmatched. The post appeared first on Bustle."

Prosecutors called their 34th and final witness on Friday, June 21, and Assistant U.S. Attorney Maurene Comey, the lead prosecutor, told U.S. District Judge Arun Subramanian the government will rest its case Monday. Earlier Friday, Brendan Paul, a former personal assistant to Combs, testified about the consuming demands of the role. He said he worked for Combs from late 2022 through March of last year, when Combs' homes were raided by federal agents. Paul was arrested the same day of the raids on drug-related charges that were dropped after he completed a drug diversion program. Friday marked the end of the trial's sixth week. Related: No Sleep, No Life, and a Gucci Bag of Drugs: Inside the Shocking Claims from Diddy's Ex-Assistant Combs' lead attorney, Marc Agnifilo, said the defense will need two to five days to present its case. Prosecutors allege Combs coerced his former longtime girlfriend Casandra ""Cassie"" Ventura, the government's star witness, and another woman who testified under the pseudonym ""Jane,"" to participate in drug-fueled marathon sex sessions that sometimes lasted days with male escorts. Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage? Sign up for PEOPLE's free True Crime newsletter for breaking crime news, ongoing trial coverage and details of intriguing unsolved cases. Jane dated Combs from 2021 until his arrest in September. She said Combs called the encounters ""hotel nights,"" while Ventura testified he referred to them as ""freak offs."" Combs' attorneys have vehemently denied the women's claims and said they both willingly participated in the encounters. Combs is also accused of running a criminal enterprise over two decades with help from his employees at various levels that committed such crimes as arson, bribery and kidnapping. He has pleaded not guilty to the charges. Read the original article on People"

mov_C36261904E05C424115B8DAA2580900C,2025-06-20 21:25:00,en,WEB,"  I'm a big fan of The Petersen Automotive Museum; the wonderful Ken Block exhibit that's still on display helped me grieve the passing of a childhood hero, and the new ""Totally Awesome! Cars and Culture of the '80s and '90s"" exhibit is another example of why this place is so special. In case you need to convince a less car-obsessed friend or significant other that paying a visit to a car museum is going to be an enjoyable part of a day in Los Angeles, this latest exhibit is car-centric, but it also showcases totally awesome and period-correct fashion trends, technologies, playable vintage arcade games, and other fun nostalgia-inducing things from the rad era. And if you're a car person hoping to see some vehicles you've never seen in person before, then you're in for a treat. From iconic concept cars that remind you of the zany way we assumed the future would look back in the '80s and '90s, to iconic movie cars and the earliest and most rare examples of luxury off-roaders, this exhibit is full of cars you won't find anywhere else. The exhibit is housed in the Mullin Grand Salon on the first floor of the museum directly across the hall from the Meyers Manx Cafe, and it's on display now through April 2026. My Favorite Car Is The 1984 Cadillac Seville By Gucci As you enter the exhibit, you're greeted by my favorite vehicle on display, a 1984 Cadillac Seville By Gucci. To the surprise of no one, the gaudy masterpiece that is the Gucci Seville was pioneered through a collaboration between a Miami Cadillac dealership and Aldo Gucci. It's unknown exactly how many were ever made but this particular car, which was won by a limousine driver on an episode of ""Wheel Of Fortune"" in 1984 that can be seen playing on a tiny period-correct television set displayed behind the Seville, is believed to be one of 10 remaining Gucci Sevilles in existence today. It is utterly flawless. From its Gucci-monogrammed vinyl roof to its gold Gucci hood ornament to its white leather seats tufted with Gucci buttons, it's a prime example of America's feeble attempts to spruce up its wretched Malaise-Era turds and compete with the high-quality imported vehicles. Next to the little television set playing ""Wheel Of Fortune,"" curators have staged two mannequins sporting the finest in mid-'80s fashion by Gucci and Bernard Perris to complete the trip back in time. Every Car In This Exhibit Has An Awesome Story Once I peeled myself away from the glorious Gucci Seville, I noticed the '80s and '90s music playing over the speakers, and was met by a handful of '80s and '90s concept cars that I had only seen in books before visiting the museum, like the 1989 Pontiac Stinger and 1997 Chrysler Copperhead. Continue walking around the exhibit and there's another extremely rare car, a beastly 1996 Nissan GT-R Nismo 400R that's a reminder of how advanced other countries' cars were. There's a wall of notable motorcycles from the era, next to the earliest examples of luxury-oriented off-roaders, including the visual nightmare that is the first ever Mercedes G-Wagen to be modified by AMG and a supremely rare GMC Syclone pace car with arguably the most early-'90s paint job I've ever seen. There is also, of course, the prerequisite display of supercars from the era, but not the ones you're likely to see at even the nicest cars and coffee. Yes, there's a McLaren F1, but this is one of the rare moments where it isn't the most exciting supercar on display. There is a 1988 Cizeta V16T with its four pop-up headlights popped up, parked next to a beautiful purple Vector M12 and the first street-legal car to produce 1,000 horsepower, the striking one-off 1995 Lotec C1000. There's Plenty For The Not-So-Car-Obsessed, Too I have been told that not everyone in the world gets excited about going to a museum to see cars. While I have a hard time believing it, I should mention that there are some other cool '80s and '90s things to see in the ""Totally Awesome"" exhibit. Beyond the questionable early-'80s fashion on display next to the Gucci Seville, there are several other, much cooler examples of what was trending in the high-fashion world at the time sprinkled throughout the gallery. Video games and movies were a big part of the zeitgeist in the '80s and '90s, and ""Totally Awesome"" doesn't ignore their influence. There's a section of the exhibit that's meant to mimic a retro arcade, with lots of contemporary arcade games placed atop a period-correct carpet covered in neon colored scribbles and squiggles, and they're all functional and free to play. There's even a sculpture comprised of several vintage television sets all playing the then-popular concept of ""Music Television,"" or MTV, not to mention the '80s and '90s jams that are playing over the speakers in the gallery. All in all, ""Totally Awesome: Cars And Culture Of The '80s And '90s"" is a fun museum exhibit that showcases several extremely rare, extremely cool pieces of automotive history, as well as a smattering of other notable pop-culture phenomena from those wacky, zany, and yes, totally awesome decades.

 Labubu玩偶本體在香港的定價為120港元（內地售價為99元人民幣），但其衍生產品娃衣的價格卻超越本體售價。 在跨境電商平台AliExpress上，單套Labubu娃衣的在香港地區的售價介於130至200港元之間。 這種高價並未阻擋玩家的熱情，不少人會為心愛的玩偶購入多套服飾進行搭配。 小紅書博主指出，部分消費者願意花費數百元購置娃衣，甚至出現單次消費超過一千元的情況。 内媒引述深圳工廠透露，Labubu娃衣的生產始於去年9月打樣，10月便不斷推出新款，11月海外訂單已出現「爆單」現象，到今年6月需求更大幅增長。 買家「咔咔」曾購入一款定價為298元人民幣的娃衣。 她稱，此類娃衣主要透過私人領域的團購渠道銷售，賣家每年開團至少4次，單次就能售出1500多件，年收入可達200萬元人民幣。 小紅書上的店主「糖糖」自去年10月起售賣自製的鈎織娃衣，產品定價在58元至78元人民幣之間。 短短半年內，其店舖的每月訂單量已穩定在300張左右，當中還包括不少海外訂單。 Labubu娃衣還掀起了一股「明星同款」熱潮，玩家熱衷於模仿權志龍、Blackpink的Jennie等藝人的造型為玩偶訂製服飾。 為了提升產品價值，部分品牌開始引入設計師聯名款，嘗試以設計溢價替代單純的價格炒作，例如一些禮服款娃衣的價格就高達1688元人民幣。 潮玩玩家表示，「娃衣周邊因定價靈活、更新速度快，利潤空間很大」。 全球娃衣市場年增12%
 除Labubu之外，「娃衣」還針對BJD娃娃（又稱「球形關節人偶」）或棉花娃娃等其他玩偶。 大數據平台藝恩數據指出，2023年全球玩偶服裝市場規模達到18億美元（約140億港元），預計到2025年，年複合增長率將保持在12%。 電商平臺淘寶的數據顯示，2023年娃衣銷售額按年增長了35%。 品牌方泡泡瑪特也曾推出官方娃衣產品，例如工裝、吊帶褲、恤衫等，中號售129元人民幣，小號售69元人民幣，但產品長期處於缺貨狀態。 產品/業務

Latem 2025 roku nosimy je w talii albo na biodrach zamiast pasków do spodni i sukienek. Oto 5 najmodniejszych stylizacji, w których warto wykorzystać ten patent. W sezonie letnim 2025 roku zamiast paska z sukienkami i kompletami z lnu nosimy apaszki. Proponujemy 5 modnych stylizacji z apaszką w roli głównej. Apaszka zamiast paska? Ten trend podbije wakacyjne kurorty Trend na noszenie apaszki zamiast paska wnosi powiew świeżości do naszej letniej garderoby i jednocześnie dodaje stylizacjom – zarówno tym na dzień, jak i tym na wieczór – nutkę klasycznej elegancji. Przy okazji mamy kolejne potwierdzenie, że dobrze dobrane dodatki czynią cuda. Szukasz inspiracji, jak wykorzystać apaszki, które już masz w swojej szafie? Przedstawiamy 5 pomysłów na letnie stylizacje z apaszką w roli głównej. Jeansy, biały T-shirt i apaszka to stylizacja dla osób, które dopiero testują ten trend Jeansy i biały T-shirt to najbardziej basicowe połączenie, jakie można sobie wyobrazić. Dzięki apaszce zawiązanej w pasie nabiera jednak wyjątkowego charakteru. Alexa Chung na spacer po mieście wybiera ciemnoniebieskie jeansy – jeden z najmodniejszych odcieni 2025 roku – oraz prosty biały T-shirt i czarne baleriny. Stylizacji dodaje pazura apaszka Gucci w klasycznych kolorach czerni i beżu. Do tego prezenterka i modelka dobrała praktyczną i modną torebkę Horsebit 1955 ze złotymi detalami. Spódniczka mini z koszulą i apaszką tworzy look w stylu preppy Styl preppy w nowoczesnym wydaniu: spódniczka mini w kratę w najmodniejszych odcieniach sezonu, takich jak żółty, z apaszką w tej samej tonacji zawiązaną w talii, z pięknie wyeksponowanym węzłem z boku. Do tego biała oversize'owa koszula i naszyjnik z pereł. Zestawienie można wykończyć eleganckimi i jednocześnie praktycznymi czółenkami slingback z wydłużonymi czubkami, które będą idealne zarówno na wieczór, jak i do pracy. Sukienka maxi i apaszka nawiązują do stylu boho Chyba nikt nie ma wątpliwości, że sukienka maxi to letni must-have. Gdy wyjeżdżasz na urlop, koniecznie włóż ją do walizki – przyda się zarówno na plaży, jak i w mieście. Apaszka podkreśla talię i dzięki geometrycznym wzorom ożywia stylizację. Akcesoria z plecionki w stylu boho chic i wiązane sandały będą świetnym wykończeniem modnego wakacyjnego looku. Jak widać, apaszka sprawdza się nie tylko przy spodniach i spódniczkach mini! Lniany komplet i apaszka przywołują na myśl wakacje w kurorcie Jeśli jesteś miłośniczką lnianych kompletów, koniecznie wypróbuj zestawienie luźnych lnianych spodni i białej koszuli, które będzie prostą, elegancką i lekką bazą do eksperymentów z dodatkami takimi jak apaszka (tutaj w neutralnych odcieniach). Całość świetnie komponuje się z balerinami w odcieniu maślanej żółci i plecioną torebką. Bermudy, top i apaszka to uniwersalny zestaw do pracy W sezonie letnim 2025 roku wygodne i niezwykle stylowe bermudy wypierają klasyczne szorty. Noś je z dopasowanym, prostym białym topem z okrągłym dekoltem i czarną marynarką z lekkich materiałów, np. lnu. Przewiązana w pasie apaszka w zwierzęcy print wygląda, jakby stanowiła integralną część spodni, i dodaje całości dynamiki i sznytu. Artykuł ukazał się oryginalnie na Vogue.it."

Picture what the typical person that buys a G-III in the last 5 years would be like. A couple of hours into our transcon he runs up to the cockpit, probably high like he usually was, screaming ""WHERE'S MY GUCCI!?!? YOU TOOK MY GUCCI!!!!"" . The Captain calmly tried to explain to him that we hadn't left the cockpit since the door closed, while I was trying to figure out what the hell he was talking about. Between yelling and accusations we finally understand he's talking about his sunglasses. So i went back, ripped all the seat cushions out, finally found his sunglasses behind the cushion of the aft divan, and handed them to him while making eye contact and not saying a single word. A couple of years later I'm walking on the ramp with the DO of a 135 that I had just been hired at, and see his airplane. Surprised, i mention to the DO that I used to fly it. He tells me the company had just bought it from him for pennies on the dollar because he lost all his money.

Jeff Bezos's wedding to Lauren Sánchez is fast approaching and high-profile guests from around the world are expected to descend upon Venice shortly. Federica Toninelli who is part of the No Space for Bezos protest group told the BBC that ""Venice is being treated like a showcase, a stage,"" and she also said:""And this wedding is the symbol of the exploitation of the city by outsiders... Venice is now just an asset."" Judging by the reaction on Reddit, it would seem that users seem to be in agreement when it comes to the views of the No Space for Bezos protest group and one user wrote: “If there's one thing Venice will never stand for, it is lavish parties thrown by ultra wealthy international merchants!” Jeff Bezos Venice Wedding: Will the city shut down after activists plan disruptions? Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez attend the 10th Annual LACMA ART+FILM GALA presented by Gucci at Los Angeles County Museum of Art on November 06, 2021 in Los Angeles, California. (Photo by Kevin Winter/) | The Facebook group No Space for Gezos has 115 likes and 178 followers (at the time of writing) One of their posts reads: CALL 4 BOATS! Do you have a motorboat? Remi? Kayak? Any means on water, even without engine , could be useful! “Write to us if you plan on participating in the protest on June 28th.” The group also encouraged people to email them directly if they want to take part. Na Haby Stella Faye told CNN that “Let's make sure that Venice is not remembered as a postcard venue where Bezos had his wedding but as the city that did not bend to oligarchs,” and also said: “We can't miss a chance to disrupt a $10-million wedding.” People gather to protest against the wedding of Amazon Founder and CEO Jeff Bezos and journalist Lauren Sanchez in Venice, on June 13, 2025. Poster campaigns and stickers have spread throughout the city, including one with images of Bezos reading ""No space for Bezos"" as some local residents protest claiming the city is transformed into a playground for billionaires.

Although some Venetians reacted positively to George and Amal Clooney's nuptials that were held in Venice in 2014, there were others who were less than happy. Town hall officials told The Times that “We had a Bollywood wedding here that went on for a week, but this was George Clooney and the Indians didn't take over the Grand Canal.” When is Jeff Bezo's wedding to Lauren Sánchez taking place? There is no official confirmation when the couple's wedding is set to take place in Venice, but reports are suggesting their nuptials will take place on June 28. The Daily Mail reported that They shared that “the island is 'off-limits to visitors' from June 24 to June 29, with the mayor believing that the wedding will take place on the yacht - although The Misericodria an iconic event space in Venice, has been booked out from June 26 to June 28."

I love it,” she tells me. “It makes life feel complete when you just have someone to fixate over.” The London-based singer-songwriter is about to be everyone's music crush. She dropped her latest single New Friends last week, is joining Halsey for stops on her North America tour, as well as opening for at BST in Hyde Park and playing Lollapalooza in Chicago. She's already released three EPs, had a track featured on Netflix hit Heartstopper, and made her debut last year. Not bad for an artist yet to release their first album, let alone one who is just 19 years old. “I just want to make pop the way I would have loved to have had it growing up,” says Cissé. “My music is very conversational, it's somewhat nostalgic, and it's super fun.” She cites everyone from ABBA to Justin Bieber as an influence. “I Iove dumb songs. I love when the lyrics are very unhinged.” Music was her first love, but it's not her first career. Cissé began modelling at 15, booking campaigns for Gucci and walking the runway at . While she learned lots from the experience, she was soon eager to return to making music. “I felt my calling was just greater than being a model,” says Cissé. “It was to express myself, and it has nothing to do with the way I look.” “I recently got blocked because someone thought a song was about them” Joyce Cissé She implicitly understands the importance of iconography in contemporary pop, the way top artists encode messages to fans. She's also got a much cooler term for it than the phrase Easter egg: “lore”. She's creating her own mythology. “I like to do things with socks, I'll have little snippets of text written on them.” She loves it when her fans go on the hunt for the hints she's dropping. “Sometimes they think stuff is a clue when it's not, and I love it,” says Cissé. Singing about love inevitably means people are desperate to work out who the subjectof a song is. There has been more than one occasion where someone in Cissé's circle mistakenly thought they had become a muse. “I recently got blocked because someone thought a song was about them,” she says. Performing is clearly home for Cissé. She would rather be on the bill at a festival than in the crowd. And she can't wait for fans to hear her new work and learn more of that lore. “It's been a long time and I'm ready,” she says. “I'm excited for people to hear my music and understand my lyrics and feel something.” Don't fight the feeling, it's about to be a summer of love — or rather, Flowerovlove."

Because another early 2000s trend (that took off in the 1980s) is back on the rise. And this time, it's the double polo shirt that has crept out of your Abercrombie & Fitch/Hollister coffins and returned with a vengeance. If you were a “prep” in the early noughties, you are all too familiar with the struggle of layering your favorite polos — popping not one, not two, but maybe even three collars. TikTok has been raving about this trend for a while now, and I have received news from L.A. and New York that this look has been spotted out in public. It even appeared on the spring/summer 2025 runways of Rhude, Craig Green, and Balenciaga. If you do want to try this trend, I suggest you begin with a lighter fabric polo as your base to ease the layering (and heat) of another polo — or two. Rhude layered polo lookcourtesy Rhude LUST FOR LINEN Is it just me, or does anyone else think of linen as a fabric that belongs to an older clientele? That familiar khaki linen almost screams Tommy Bahama and a fold-out beach chair. Well, if you do, it's time to snap out of it. Not only is this fabric the most breathable in warmer days, but designers have honed in on pushing this lightweight, breathable cloth down the runways. Brands like Dior, Zegna, and Dunhill have sent down models in khaki linen suits, whereas Magliano opted for black linens, and Dolce & Gabbana sent out a slew of white linen looks. Walking down Fifth Avenue recently, I spotted linen suits in black and white at many of your well-known retailers. So sit back, relax, and feel the summer breeze in an easy linen suit — because it's cool to dress like your dad again. Dolce & Gabbana white linen lookcourtesy Dolce & Gabbana BET ON BOXERS The debate of boxers versus briefs has riddled the menswear community for decades. Of course, your comfort matters. In our community, it's not limited to boxers or briefs! However, the trend report has been showing an increase in boxers being worn — and shown — as midriffs as temperatures rise. High-end brands such as Gucci, Versace, and Dior have been making boxers with their illustrious logos on the waistband, so why wouldn't you want to show that off with a little sneak peek? ERL's spring/summer 2025 collection showed us the sexy “Marky Mark” way to do this, but you can always opt for just feeling the breeze and not letting anyone know what's going on down there. ERL exposed boxers lookcourtesy ERL THE SUMMER OF LABUBU These cute little plush dolls, hailing from Hong Kong artist Kasing Lung, aren't just for your girlfriend's purse anymore. The Labubu craze has taken full effect on everyone in the U.S., ranging from kids to grandparents and anyone in between (even straight teenage boys). The handbag charm craze has been taking the world by storm, but it's time to make (even more) room for these soda can-sized dolls. They come in every color of the rainbow, and some have cute little outfits! Attach them to your man purse, messenger bag, or even your backpack as these dolls are heading toward a collectible and maybe unattainable category.

mov_49ADB9F3DAC0E06CCEE0B3C4A537228B,2025-06-22 01:29:19,en,WEB,"  Millennials get a lot of flak for disrupting the market. They've ditched cable, abandoned department stores, and practically ghosted cereal. But despite their reputation for challenging norms and reshaping consumer habits, there are a handful of things they just keep buying—regardless of rising costs or changing trends. These aren't ironic purchases or nostalgic throwbacks. These are the staples, the comforts, and the low-key obsessions that have survived through student loans, economic recessions, and the chaos of adulting in the digital age. It's not that millennials are stuck in the past. They're simply loyal to what works for them, even if the world expects them to let go. Whether it's self-care essentials, everyday luxuries, or things that remind them of simpler times, these items have secured their place in the millennial shopping cart. Here are 11 products and services that millennials, despite all the changes and challenges, still aren't ready to give up—and probably never will. Wearing designer labels isn't a crime, but when someone makes sure every photo, outing, and conversation includes a shout-out to their Gucci belt or Louis Vuitton bag, it raises eyebrows. True wealth often values discretion over name-dropping, . People who are genuinely comfortable financially don't need to advertise it at every turn. Constantly flexing expensive brands can signal insecurity—and sometimes it hints that the purchases are more about appearances than actual lifestyle. If the luxury items seem to matter more than anything else, debt might be fueling the whole performance. Despite inflation and budget apps screaming “brew at home,” millennials still line up for $6 lattes like it's a necessary part of survival. It's not just about caffeine—it's an experience, according to Jeff Fromm at Forbes. A favorite café can feel like a sanctuary in the chaos of adulthood. There's comfort in the ritual of ordering a flat white just the way you like it and sipping it while answering emails or catching up with a friend. This coffee habit isn't about being extravagant. It's one of the small indulgences that makes the daily grind more bearable. Many millennials see it as an investment in sanity, not just a beverage. Plus, they're supporting local shops and fair-trade roasters, which fits their values. The expense might raise eyebrows, but for this generation, the joy it brings outweighs the guilt. Why struggle in silence when you can ask your network? Gen Z uses Twitter threads, Reddit posts, or Instagram stories to ask for career advice, salary info, and portfolio feedback. It's bold, and it works. By inviting others into their learning process, they build relationships with people who want to help—or who admire their vulnerability. Crowdsourcing isn't lazy. It's collaborative. And it often gets you farther, faster, than trying to figure everything out solo. Millennials grew up during the acne-commercial boom and carried that obsession straight into adulthood. Now it's serums, masks, exfoliants, and creams promising glass skin or eternal youth. The routine may be expensive and slightly overwhelming, but it's also therapeutic. Slathering on vitamin C serum in the morning and retinol at night isn't just about vanity—it's about control, as stated by Goreta BoškoviÄ at Ardelle. There's something grounding in the act of self-care, especially in a world that feels chaotic. Plus, skincare content is all over their feeds, feeding curiosity and FOMO. Even when money's tight, millennials are more likely to skimp on other things before ditching their 10-step skincare ritual. It's a ritual that feels personal and hopeful, even if the results are subtle at best. Millennials grew up during the acne-commercial boom and carried that obsession straight into adulthood.

It's a ritual that feels personal and hopeful, even if the results are subtle at best. The joke's been made a thousand times, but millennials still haven't let go of their beloved avocado toast, as stated by Eleanor Pringle at Fortune. It's fast, easy, nutritious, and photogenic—what's not to love? It's also a small luxury that feels indulgent without being over-the-top. You can whip it up at home or grab it at a trendy brunch spot, and it never really gets old...."

Džordžs Lūkass vispirms piedāvāja Hanu Solo Pačīno, lomu, kuru galu galā ieguva Harisons Fords. Aktieris atklāja, ka viņam arī tika dots skripts, lai to izlasītu. Papildus tam Pačīno par daļu tika piedāvāta liela naudas summa, taču, neskatoties uz skaisto darījumu, viņš atzina, ka nevar to izdarīt. Zvaigžņu kari pirmais šāviens kosmosā tālu, tālā galaktikā 1977. gadā ar Harisons Fordu, Keriju Fišeru un Marku Hemilu galvenajās lomās. Franšīze kļuva par spēļu mainītāju un popkultūras hitu, savācot spēcīgu fanu bāzi no visas pasaules. SAISTĪTI : Al Pačīno noraidīja 1,15 miljardu dolāru Action kulta klasikas franšīzi, liekot Silvestram Stallonem ieņemt vadošo lomu un nopelnīt 400 miljonus dolāru Kāpēc Krusttēvs Al Pačīno atteicās Zvaigžņu kari Loma Al Pačīno uzstājās The 92nd Street Y, Ņujorkā, un apstiprināja, ka viņš bija pirmais, kurš saņēma piedāvājumu Han Solo lomai, daļa, kas tika piešķirta Harisons Fords . Viņš teica (caur Daudzveidība ): ' Nu, es noraidīju filmu “Zvaigžņu kari”. Kad es pirmo reizi pieteicos, es biju jaunais bērns, zini, kas notiek, kad pirmo reizi kļūsti slavens. Tas ir tāpat kā “Dodiet Al.” Viņi man dotu karalieni Elizabeti spēlēt. Viņi man iedeva scenāriju ar nosaukumu “Zvaigžņu kari”. Viņi man piedāvāja tik daudz naudas. es to nesaprotu. Es to izlasīju. Tāpēc es teicu, ka nevaru to izdarīt. Es devu Harisonam Fordam karjeru ”. Patiešām, uzsākot Zvaigžņu kari franšīze pacēla Ford karjeru jaunos augstumos. Šajā laikā Pačīno bija pieprasīts aktieris, kurš tikko filmējies divatā Krusttēvs filmas. Bija tikai jēga, ka viņu vēlējās daudzi režisori, īpaši Lūkass, kurš ir arī labs draugs Frensisam Fordam Kopolas direktoram. Krusttēvs filmas. Nav ierakstu, cik daudz naudas Lucasfilm piedāvāja Pačīno. Saskaņā ar ziņojumiem Ford saņēma 10 000 USD pēc pirmā Zvaigžņu kari filma. Pačīno šajā periodā bija populārāks un viņam bija lielākas lomas nekā Fordam, tāpēc viņš būtu ieguvis lielāku atalgojumu, ja vien būtu atbildējis šim darbam. Interesanti, ka Fordam ir piešķirti 25 miljoni dolāru, lai atkārtotu viņa lomu kā Han Solo Disneja turpinājumu triloģijā, kas ir milzīga summa, ko Pačīno šodien noteikti nožēlotu. Neatkarīgi no tā, pēdējais apgalvo, ka Fords viņam ir parādā savu karjeru, jo Han Solo loma viņu aizveda līdz zvaigznei un pēc tam noveda aktieri pie daudziem citiem projektiem. SAISTĪTI : 'Pēkšņi tas kļuva par izaicinājumu': Als Pačīno trīs reizes atteica Keanu Rīvsu, pirms viņš kļuva par globālu fenomenu ar Matrix franšīzi Al Pacino gaidāmajos projektos ietilpst Šekspīra luga un memuāri Tā kā dzīvi var dzīvot tikai uz priekšu, Al Pacino virzās uz priekšu no atmiņas Zvaigžņu kari un tagad strādā pie jauna projekta – adaptācijas Karalis Līrs pēc Viljama Šekspīra slavenās lugas motīviem. Neskatoties uz to, ka viņš pirms daudziem gadiem paziņoja par aiziešanu pensijā, viņš turpina pieņemt projektus un nākotnē joprojām plāno strādāt pie jaunām lietām. Viņa jaunākie darbi ietver Gucci māja un Prime Video Mednieki . Aktieris arī raksta memuārus par savu ražīgo karjeru. Tas paliek bez nosaukuma, un tas tiks rakstīts kopā ar līdzautoru. Als Pačīno cer, ka viņa bērni to izlasīs un atskatīsies uz to, kā viņš noraidīja a Zvaigžņu kari lomu, jo viņš nevarēja saprast stāstu.

': Ikke skuespil, 2-gange Oscar-nominerede Adam Driver vil aldrig glemme, at han engang var marinesoldat - hvorfor blev han udskrevet fra korpset? Adam Driver er en af de dygtigste skuespillere i den nuværende generation, som ikke higer efter berømmelse og opmærksomhed, men snarere fokuseret på at gøre godt arbejde. Han har fået nogle af de mest modne og funderede præstationer i nyere tid med film som Paterson, Silence, The Report, Marriage Story, The Last Duel , og House of Gucci . Han er mest anerkendt for at spille Kylo Ren i Star wars efterfølgertrilogi. Han er en kraftfuld performer, der kan forpligte sig til enhver rolle, han får, og levere fantastiske og mindeværdige præstationer. Før han blev skuespiller, meldte Driver sig frivilligt til at tjene i US Marine Corps efter angrebene 9/11 i 2001. Men hans tid der blev afskåret på grund af en ulykke. Men Driver er stadig meget stolt af at have aftjent nogen tid i militæret og sætter det endda over sit nuværende skuespillerjob.

Men før han begav sig ud i skuespillerverdenen, var han tidligere en dedikeret og stolt marinesoldat, som han tjente i to år og otte måneder. Men en mountainbike-ulykke afbrød hans karriere som marinesoldat, og han var knust. Han gav udtryk for, at det at være marinesoldat var det stolteste i hans liv under en TED Talk (den Youtube ). Han sagde, 'Jeg elskede det, jeg elskede at være marinesoldat. Det er en af de ting, jeg er mest stolt af at have gjort i mit liv. Jeg elskede marinekorpset mest for det, jeg ledte mindst efter, da jeg tiltrådte, som var folket. Et par år efter min tjeneste og måneder væk fra udsendelse til Irak, fik jeg mit brystben forskudt i en mountainbike-ulykke og måtte adskilles lægeligt. At få at vide, at jeg ikke blev udsendt til Irak eller Afghanistan, var meget ødelæggende for mig. Og så var jeg pludselig civil igen.” Chaufføren talte også om, hvordan han havde svært ved at tilpasse sig det civile liv og sagde: »Jeg troede, at alle civile problemer var små sammenlignet med militæret. Men jeg var overrasket over, hvor kompleks overgangen var fra militær til civil. Det var svært, dels fordi jeg gik på skuespillerskole, og også fordi jeg ikke vidste, hvordan jeg skulle anvende de ting, jeg lærte i militæret, i en civil kontekst., både praktisk og følelsesmæssigt. Jeg kæmpede for at finde mening, i militæret havde alt mening. I den civile verden er der ingen rang, du er bare en anden krop, og jeg følte konstant, at jeg skulle bevise mit værd igen.' Driver arbejdede hårdt og klarede det i Hollywood på grund af hans engagement og naturlige talent som skuespiller. Hans livshistorie er inspirerende og giver en vigtig morale om, at alle kan lykkes med hvad som helst, så længe de lægger deres hjerte og sjæl i det.

However, I'd contend that the most stylish off-duty looks are the ones that occur in the arrival and departure halls. While most of us believe that showing up for our flight in a tracksuit and comfortable trainers would more than suffice, it's clear that Hollywood's elite don't share this school of thought. Need proof? Just look at the countless iconic airport outfits that put our elasticated waistbands and neck pillows to shame. Even before the days of express security lanes and first-class lounges, A-listers soared through the skies wearing something that epitomised sophistication. (Read: MarilynMonroe boarding a flight from New York City to Chicago wearing stilettos and a furry coat.) It's true, celebrities have been showing up in iconic airport outfits for as long as commercial flights have been operating. Though you think this might've quelled given the increase in private jet usage, I'd argue that the opposite has actually occurred. From the Nice Côte d'Azur airport every Cannes Film Festival to the baggage carousels of Charles de Gaulle come Paris Fashion Week, you can always count on spotting someone of note wearing something you'd never consider wearing when in mid-air. Sure, you could argue that looking good and being fashion's barometer come with the territory of being famous. But, there's something so riveting about seeing someone take airport style so seriously. As the season of Euro Summer begins–and we ourselves start to think about what outfits will help us look elegant while sitting in premium economy—it's only fitting that we turn to the most iconic airport outfits to help inspire our own ensemble. From Daisy Edgar-Jones' balmy Gucci bags to the halcyon heydays of 90s supermodels catching the Concorde, uncover the best sartorial moments to grace the tarmac below. Ready for takeoff? The 15 Most Iconic Airport Looks to Inspire Your Summer Travel Wardrobe 1. Bella Hadid Style Notes: There's nothing overtly glamorous about Bella Hadid's look from 2022. In fact, if you didn't know that she was arriving on the French Riviera, you might just think she was heading out of a pilates class thanks to the slinky fabric, body-contouring fit and Apple AirPods Max. It's these elements that make it so iconic. It's well known that wearing compression clothing is essential for any long-haul flight, and if you can make it look like you've just stepped off a Tom Ford for Gucci runway, why wouldn't you? Shop the Look: ARKET Rib Racer Tank Top No wardrobe is complete without a simple basic like this. H&M Ribbed Vest Top Layering is a masterful trick to bring more dimension to your look. Pairing two tops together can instantly make your look feel more considered. LESET Rio Stretch-Ponte Stirrup Leggings 2. Gwyneth Paltrow Style Notes: Gwyneth Paltrow has always been a patron saint of minimalism. Long before the days of G.Label by Goop and her colourful Montecito wardrobe, the actress-turned-entrepreneur regularly sported timeless classics from the likes of Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren. In this photo, which was taken at L.A.X in 1998, Paltrow is proving that investing in good quality fabrics and timeless shapes will always be a wise venture. Shop the Look: DÔEN Cassidy Pointelle-Knit Alpaca-Blend Cardigan MANGO Sleeveless Turtleneck Top Such a versatile top. Reformation Mason Pant 3. Naomi Campbell Style Notes: When you think of Naomi Campbell and airports, the first image that springs to mind is most likely the photo of her wearing a hazmat suit, N95 face mask, plastic gloves and shawl. (As it should, it is in the V&A after all!) However, if the category is iconic airport outfits, we can't ignore this oh-so enviable look from 1998...."

c53086dd5bfc6d81ae7cc6645b8b79f6,2025-06-22 08:26:00,en,WEB,"  Introducing Alex from MAIORANO in an exclusive KALTBLUT. editorial entitled Café Dreams! Photographed by Jess Kearney, this piece features luxury brands such as Gucci, Wrangler, Barbour, and Lacoste. Italian-born artist MAIORANO beckons listeners into a deeply emotional and introspective journey with their latest single, “Rosa.” Forgoing the predictable formula of catchy hooks and immediate rewards, the band crafts a rich sonic experience that unfolds through three poignant verses. Each lyric captures a heartfelt personal truth, delivered with a resonant intensity that lingers long after hearing. Alex, can you tell us the story behind your new single “Rosa”? What inspired the lyrics and emotion behind it? “Rosa” is a sad story, and I tried to make it feel a bit lighter through the music. It is not about a lover or a grandmother; it is the story of a father who destroys his path by killing his daughter. It is a heavy way to start, but that is the truth. It stayed in my mind for years until I turned it into a song. The song has a raw and emotional quality. How did you approach the production to capture that essence? Even though I have been making music for years, my approach to production is still very raw. I usually write with a small acoustic guitar and record ideas on my phone. In those early moments, I imagine how the song might eventually sound. Once I feel ready, I bring it to the band and from there we shape it into what it becomes. Your heritage seems to influence your music significantly. How do your Italian roots shape your sound and artistic expression? That is definitely true. In recent years, I have been influenced by a lot of Italian music, from classic songwriters like Battisti and Dalla to underground producers from the seventies. I would not call my music Italian exactly, but if you know that world, you will hear the influences. Plus, two other members of the band are Italian as well, so it was not just me bringing that in. Growing up, I was mostly into music from other countries and did not explore Italian music. But once I did, I could not stop. There is so much depth to I, and I love how some of those artists change style with every album, exploring genres without labels. I see the same in my band, too. Let us talk about the magic and importance of band members. How did you meet Alessio, Emiliano, Nicola and Mauro, and what roles do they play in your musical journey? Magic is exactly the word. We are close friends, and musically we are really in tune with each other. When we are on stage, I feel like we all experience the same thing. I see it in their faces before, during and after a show; we are always aligned. Alessio, on drums, and I have been playing together since we were teenagers. We even moved to Berlin together to chase our music dreams. Later, we met Nicola on sax and keys, and the three of us played in different projects for years, touring, travelling and building a real friendship. More recently, we added Mauro and Emiliano on bass and guitar, two incredible musicians from Argentina. They bring not just talent but a vibe and energy that fits the band. I write the songs, and they shape the music, the groove, and help me deliver it. The combination of pop, soul and funk in your music is captivating. How would you describe your band's unique sound? I would say the new album is very groovy and very pop. Every track has a groove, and they are catchy. I love pop songs with choruses that stick. I am drawn to reggae and funky guitar style, so I have tried to blend those into our music. And soul, while we are not exactly a soul band, we bring soul into it. How did relocating to Berlin influence your music and your approach to creating as a band? Coming from a small town in Italy, moving to Berlin was a big shift. The music here is everywhere, and I got to finally be part of it, going to parties I only dreamed about, meeting DJs and musicians, and just soaking it all in...."

mov_F4A075682ED54F338D61B398E504BBE3,2025-06-22 11:30:39,ro,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[ro]Henry Ford, fondatorul companiei Ford Motor Company și pionier al industriei auto, omul care a transformat producția în masă a mașinilor, a lăsat în urmă o serie de predicții uimitoare despre viitor, multe dintre ele adeverindu-se. Una dintre cele mai cunoscute afirmații ale lui Henry Ford a fost: „Voi construi o mașină accesibilă pentru marea majoritate.” În 1908, Ford a lansat Modelul T, prima mașină produsă în masă la un preț accesibil. Prin introducerea liniei de asamblare în 1913, a redus timpul de producție și costurile, la aproximativ 93 de minute în 1914, făcând mașinile disponibile pentru milioane de oameni. Democratizarea automobilului Până în 1927, peste 15 milioane de unități Model T fuseseră vândute, astfel, conceptul de mașină de familie a devenit standardul global, în același timp inspirând industrii să adopte producția în masă. „Combustibili alternativi” – vizunea lui Ford despre energie sustenabilă În anii 1920, Henry Ford a declarat: „Era benzinei va fi doar o etapă trecătoare. În viitor, vom folosi combustibili din plante.” Ford a experimentat cu etanolul din porumb și biodiesel și chiar a colaborat cu Thomas Edison pentru a crea o mașină pe bază de bio-combustibil (Bioetanolul și biomotorina sunt utilizate pe scară largă astăzi, industria auto globală îndreptându-se spre emisiile zer). Ford a introdus în gama sa diverse modele hibride (Escape Hybrid din 2004, Fusion Hybrid din 2009 etc.) și a intrat în forță pe piața auto full-electric odată cu lansarea SUV‑ului Mustang Mach‑E în 2020. „Autostrăzi și infrastructură modernă” – planul pentru drumuri mai bune Ford, care a prevăzut că: „Vom avea nevoie de un sistem național de autostrăzi pentru a conecta țara.”, a militat pentru îmbunătățirea infrastructurii rutiere, sprijinind proiecte hidroenergetice și susținând taxe pentru autostrăzi. „Salariul de 5 dolari pe zi” – revoluția condițiilor muncitorești În 1914, Ford a introdus un salariu de 5 dolari pe zi pentru muncitorii săi, aceasta fiind o mișcare fără precedent, deoarece dubla salariul mediu al vremii – care era de 2,5$ pe zi, a redus schimbarea personalului cu 90% – angajații nu mai plecau la alte fabrici, reducând costurile de recrutare și formare, a crescut productivitatea cu 40-70% (muncitorii mulțumiți lucrau mai eficient), și a inspirat introducerea diverselor beneficii pentru angajați în corporații (companiile au început să ofere asigurări medicale, concedii plătite și programe de pensii, modelând relațiile de muncă din secolul XX.) De ce a făcut asta? Ford a înțeles că angajații săi trebuie să-și permită mașinile pe care le construiau – creând astfel și clienți fideli. Impactul actual se reflectă în companii precum Google și Amazon care oferă salarii mari și beneficii pentru a atrage talente. Conceptul de „angajat mulțumit, companie prosperă” a rămas relevant. „Globalizarea și interconectivitatea” Ford a anticipat că lumea va deveni un singur mare oraș, unde distanțele vor fi eliminate. Prin fabrici deschise în Europa, Asia și America de Sud, el a pus bazele producției globale. Realitatea de azi constă în lanțuri de aprovizionare globale care domină economia, internetul și transportul rapid micșorând distanțele. „Educația continuă și inovația” Ford credea că „oricine poate învăța orice, dacă i se oferă șansa”. A înființat școli de meserii și a susținut educația practică. Legatura cu prezentul ar fi cursurile online (Coursera, Udemy sunt doar câteva exemple) care democratizează educația. Ford Fund continuă să investească în programe educaționale. Henry Ford a depășit cu mult statutul său de „omul care a inventat mașina accesibilă”, devenind un adevărat vizionar. Predicțiile sale despre combustibili alternativi, autostrăzi, salarii mai bune și mașini autonome demonstrează, cum este evident, o înțelegere profundă a progresului. Henry Ford s-a născut la 30 iulie 1863 în Michigan, SUA. De la o copilărie petrecută într-o fermă, Ford și-a dezvoltat pasiunea pentru mecanică, construind prima sa mașină, Ford Quadricycle, în 1896. În 1903, a fondat Ford Motor Company, iar în 1908 a lansat Modelul T, prima mașină accesibilă publicului larg. Prin introducerea liniei de asamblare (1913), a redus timpul de producție de la 12 ore la doar 93 de minute, transformând industria manufacturieră. Ford a impus și salariul de 5 dolari pe zi (1914), stabilind un standard pentru drepturile muncitorilor. Deși controversat pentru unele opinii politice, a avut o influență imensă, promovând combustibili alternativi și prevăzând mașinile autonome. Henry Ford a încetat din viață în 1947, dar viziunea și contribuțiile sale au marcat profund întreaga evoluție a secolului XX. Astăzi, Ford Motor Company rămâne un gigant global, respectând principiile sale: accesibilitate, eficiență și progres.

However, I'd contend that the most stylish off-duty looks are the ones that occur in the arrival and departure halls. While most of us believe that showing up for our flight in a tracksuit and comfortable trainers would more than suffice, it's clear that Hollywood's elite don't share this school of thought. Need proof? Just look at the countless iconic airport outfits that put our elasticated waistbands and neck pillows to shame. Even before the days of express security lanes and first-class lounges, A-listers soared through the skies wearing something that epitomised sophistication. (Read: Marilyn Monroe boarding a flight from New York City to Chicago wearing stilettos and a furry coat.) It's true, celebrities have been showing up in iconic airport outfits for as long as commercial flights have been operating. Though you think this might've quelled given the increase in private jet usage, I'd argue that the opposite has actually occurred. From the Nice Côte d'Azur airport every Cannes Film Festival to the baggage carousels of Charles de Gaulle come Paris Fashion Week, you can always count on spotting someone of note wearing something you'd never consider wearing when in mid-air. Sure, you could argue that looking good and being fashion's barometer come with the territory of being famous. But, there's something so riveting about seeing someone take airport style so seriously. As the season of Euro Summer begins–and we ourselves start to think about what outfits will help us look elegant while sitting in premium economy—it's only fitting that we turn to the most iconic airport outfits to help inspire our own ensemble. From Daisy Edgar-Jones' balmy Gucci bags to the halcyon heydays of 90s supermodels catching the Concorde, uncover the best sartorial moments to grace the tarmac below. Ready for takeoff? The 15 Most Iconic Airport Looks to Inspire Your Summer Travel Wardrobe 1. Bella Hadid Style Notes: There's nothing overtly glamorous about Bella Hadid's look from 2022. In fact, if you didn't know that she was arriving on the French Riviera, you might just think she was heading out of a pilates class thanks to the slinky fabric, body-contouring fit and Apple AirPods Max. It's these elements that make it so iconic. It's well known that wearing compression clothing is essential for any long-haul flight, and if you can make it look like you've just stepped off a Tom Ford for Gucci runway, why wouldn't you? Shop the Look: ARKET Rib Racer Tank Top No wardrobe is complete without a simple basic like this. H&M Ribbed Vest Top Layering is a masterful trick to bring more dimension to your look. Pairing two tops together can instantly make your look feel more considered. LESET Rio Stretch-Ponte Stirrup Leggings Stirrup leggings are an essential part of any airport wardrobe. 2. Gwyneth Paltrow Style Notes: Gwyneth Paltrow has always been a patron saint of minimalism. Long before the days of G.Label by Goop and her colourful Montecito wardrobe, the actress-turned-entrepreneur regularly sported timeless classics from the likes of Calvin Klein and Ralph Lauren. In this photo, which was taken at L.A.X in 1998, Paltrow is proving that investing in good quality fabrics and timeless shapes will always be a wise venture. Shop the Look: DÔEN Cassidy Pointelle-Knit Alpaca-Blend Cardigan This is the perfect travel companion if you're packing light. MANGO Sleeveless Turtleneck Top Such a versatile top. Reformation Mason Pant If you're seeking a high-quality wide-leg trouser, Reformation's Mason pant is it. 3. Naomi Campbell Style Notes: When you think of Naomi Campbell and airports, the first image that springs to mind is most likely the photo of her wearing a hazmat suit, N95 face mask, plastic gloves and shawl. (As it should, it is in the V&A after all!) However, if the category is iconic airport outfits, we can't ignore this oh-so enviable look from 1998. If you don't know the story, the tale is that Campbell was stranded in Milan and was about to miss walking in Marc Jacobs's debut ready-to-wear collection. Next thing she knew, the designer sent her a private jet laden with custom designer bags to bring her to Paris. We might not have the luxury totes, but you can always replicate her ivory pedal pushers and navy fine-knit top. Shop the Look: Massimo Dutti Long Voluminous Cotton Blend Trench Coat From Saint Moritz to Saint-Tropez, this trench coat will serve you in countless climates. ZARA Knit Top With Piping Style with a pair of gingham shorts and you'll have an outfit worthy to be worn in Marseille. Nobodys Child White Denim Capri Jeans The perfect all-white outfit. 4. Victoria Beckham Style Notes: Victoria Beckham and airports are a match made in heaven. The former pop star doesn't abide by average style rules. Rather than sensible footwear and smart carry-on baggage, the fashion designer wears Hermés bags and peep-toe shoes. But that's exactly what we love about Posh Spice...."
mov_A9E15065FCCD778CA17661749D4384EA,2025-06-22 15:11:06,en,WEB,"  Nicki Minaj recently fueled rumors about her response to a revived claim from her former manager, Debra “Deb” Antney. In 2024, Antney claimed that she was offered $5 million to walk away from Minaj's tour. Deb Antney is a music executive and manager known for guiding the careers of famous hip-hop artists like Gucci Mane, French Montana, and Nicki Minaj early in her career. Born in Queens, Antney moved to Atlanta and founded her management company, Mizay Entertainment, in 2007. Besides her work in the industry, she is recognized as the mother of rapper Waka Flocka Flame, who often credits her for his success. During an interview with in November 2024, Antney claimed that she was offered $5 million to stop managing Nicki Minaj and abandon the tour. Antney acknowledged needing the money but declined the offer, saying: ""I needed that money at the time, but no amount could make me turn my back on her. That's my child, no matter what. We don't even have to speak again, but that's still how I feel.” The claim resurfaced on June 20, 2025, when Minaj tweeted: “I wonder who offered Deb 5MM to leave the tour.” Nicki Minaj and Deb Antney's public disagreement over Lil Kim Deb Antney and Nicki Minaj have experienced some differences in the public eye. In June 2024, during an appearance on the , Antney confessed to trying to get Lil' Kim, the rapper who had been Minaj's rival for much of her career, on a tour. Minaj, who had no knowledge of the move until then, blasted Deb Antney on X on June 30, 2024, in a now-deleted tweet. “Deb, Isn't it funny how you left out the biggest part of the story? I didn't ask you to do a THING! You told me AFTER THE FACT & I SCREAMED ON YOU & told you if you reach out to ppl now that you're being seen around me, they will THINK it's coming FROM ME so to NEVER do that again w/o discussing it with me FIRST,” she wrote. Although this moment created tension, the two made up shortly after. Minaj later posted a video of Antney dancing to an unreleased track, indicating their bond remained strong. The friction between Nicki Minaj and Lil Kim reportedly began in the late 2000s, when Minaj's early success led the public to compare her to Kim. Lil Kim accused Minaj of copying her style, while the latter denied all allegations. Tensions reached new heights with the release of Kim's February 2011 mixtape , a play on Minaj's debut album, . Minaj retaliated two months later by releasing a diss track, , in April 2011. Nicki Minaj recently collaborated with Lil Wayne to make a remix of his new track, . The single, released on June 11, 2025, skyrocketed to the top of the charts immediately. Feedback Why did you not like this content? Cancel Submit Was this article helpful?

mz8mjxj,2025-06-22 23:40:13,en,REDDIT,"  Luckily for me, I did not. My manager at the time did due to someone trying to deposit a fraud check. To make it a not too long story, a Spanish girl came in and wanted to deposit a check. Swiped her card and everything was Gucci. I had this weird feeling that something was completely off about not just her, but the check. So I did what most people in banking do in this situation and investigate. Turns out, it was a fraudulent check. Someone hand written the check and when I went into the system, it's wayyy different than what was presented to me (red flag #1). The way the check felt told me that someone printed it from their crib (red flag #2). She got anxious and told me is everything okay (red flag #3). I let my colleagues on Teams know about the situation and a Banker came up to make sure my thought process matched hers in terms of a potential fraud while my manager called the cops and them mfs came fast. Like super quick. The person she must have been with sped off while the girl got arrested that day. Never seen her again afterwards lol. And what I've learned that day is this. When people do fraud, that's their way of not getting money the right way and eventually get caught up into some shit that'll not only bite them in the ass, but it's going to be difficult to find employment when most companies do a background check"

He uncovers his anxiously awaited seventeenth full-length album, Episodes, on October 17 via 1017/Atlantic Music Group, and it accompanies his second book—also entitled Episodes—out October 14 on Simon & Schuster. There's no better way to celebrate “10/17” this year… Both tracks find Guwop in top form as he bodies the production with confessional, catchy, and endlessly quotable rhymes. Accompanying this drop, iconic and influential filmmaker, director, screenwriter, and producer Harmony Korine [Kids, Gummo] notably helmed an AI music video incorporating both “Voices” and “Psycho.” It's Gucci Mane like you've never seen him. The visual also continues his longstanding creative collaboration with Korine who cast the hip-hop icon in his 2012 critically acclaimed cult classic Spring Breakers. The video is powered by EDGLRD who brought this to life in a short timeframe, blending high-level creativity with emerging technology and AI, all delivered with a meticulous, high-touch approach. About the video, EDGLRD commented, “We made this with just three photos of Gucci, AI, and VFX. It's a low-lift process for the artist and high-impact for the fans. We're excited to continue pushing this technology and format forward.” Marking a career first, Episodes acts as an emotionally charged high stakes soundtrack for the book, which reveals Gucci Mane's struggles with mental health and drug addiction and provides fans and readers with insights into his career and life. These “Episodes” encompassed what happened behind the music itself. Between disclosing his own stories, he even personally interviews various mental health professionals in order to offer a well-rounded and informed perspective. Throughout Episodes, he holds nothing back and ultimately finds healing in his words on the page and on tape. Distinguishing himself as the hardest working man in hip-hop, Gucci Mane served up the mixtape Greatest Of All Trappers (Gangsta Grillz Edition) hosted by DJ Drama in 2024. NPR hailed the latter as “a callback to a bygone era and yet one whose reverberations are everywhere,” going on to profess, “It is only through this process of reliving and commemorating what was that it's really possible to see the afterimage of what these two artists helped build everywhere, and realize that the spirit of the mixtape format is eternal.” In support of the project, he headlined a sold-out show with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra during October. Get ready to experience Episodes and more from Gucci Mane in 2025. ABOUT EPISODES: As one of hip-hop's legendary figures and an indispensable fixture in Atlanta's vibrant rap culture, Gucci Mane was on an upswing in his career when he sold his debut memoir, The Autobiography of Gucci Mane in 2016. He had just been released from prison, sporting a slimmer physique and health-conscious diet; he announced his ninth album, the platinum-selling Everybody Looking; and became the face of a global campaign with the luxury Italian designer that inspired his name and persona. But underneath all that, he was hiding some of his darkest struggles from the world. Now he is ready to tell his full story. In Episodes, Gucci revisits his life and shares what was really going on for the first time. The mental anguish, the pitfalls, the triggers no one speaks about. Each episode is Gucci experiencing something—something you may remember from the news or even heard in his music—and giving you the background of where he was mentally. He reveals how his fascination with money got the worst of him, why he committed certain crimes, the story behind his ice cream cone tattoo, and how his wife felt watching him overdose. Along the way, he interviews medical professionals and mental health experts to provide insight into mental health awareness. Episodes is Gucci's way of reaching beyond the “each one, teach one” approach of discussing mental illness behind closed doors, opting instead to cultivate a discourse amongst a culture that, while steadily improving how it regards mental health, still stigmatizes public discussions around the topic. This compelling memoir sheds light on both his inner struggles and his triumphs, offering an unflinching account of a man who defied the odds to leave a lasting legacy on music, culture, and conversations around mental health. ABOUT GUCCI MANE Currently boasting over 16 billion global streams and more than 4.5 billion official views on YouTube, Gucci Mane wrapped up 2024 with another strong year of releases following his latest album in 2023, Breath of Fresh Air, available via Atlantic Records/The New 1017 Records. Widely regarded as one of the most influential rappers of the past decade, Gucci Mane has more top 10 albums on Billboard's “Top Rap Albums” chart than any other hip-hop artist in history. Along with new releases from Gucci Mane himself, the seasoned A&R has taken his eye for the next big thing to his own record label, The New 1017, in partnership with Atlantic Records. The New 1017 showcases Gucci Mane's platinum-certified A&R skills with a roster that includes some of the best and brightest rising stars.

mz9o74o,2025-06-23 03:21:13,en,REDDIT,"  **Yuzuru Hanyu and GUCCI: Tracing the origins of creativity** A Great Step The wardrobe worn by professional figure skater Yuzuru Hanyu in this collaboration is a distillation of GUCCI's refinement, dignity, and artisanal craftsmanship. In the sense that both Hanyu and the brand have left behind “great footprints” in the past, yet continue to move forward without pause, they share a common spirit. After the great success of his third solo ice story, Echoes of Life, which he has worked on since turning professional, Hanyu is now exploring ideas for what comes next. In this interview, he reflects on his daily life devoted to creation. Editor-in-Chief Fumofumo asks: Hanyu's approach to creative activity What lies beyond “expression"" : Yuzuru Hanyu speaks on the evolution of his creations *— In your most recent ice story, Echoes of Life, you wrote an original novel, crafting the world and its characters yourself. How do you perceive the evolution of your creative work? * It's really just a continuation from the very first ice show... I guess I've gotten a little more used to it over time. The core themes I want to write about or the emotions I want to express haven't changed. But the outer layer, the form of the expression around it, that's what keeps changing. Since I'm constantly studying, I've gradually come to be able to use other forms of expression. I feel like I now have more tools to convey the essence of what I want to say, depending on the moment. What I strongly felt while writing Echoes of Life was that, whether it's through words or through skating, expression at its root is about conveying something. Whether that's done through shifts in tone, or through narrative structure, that's no different from how I've been building my skating programs and stories. I started to realize that what I've learned for figure skating can actually be used when writing too. *—Is there a difference or distinction between ""communicating"" with words and ""communicating"" through acting? * Yes, I do make that distinction. One thing about us figure skaters is that because we express ourselves physically, there's no language barrier, it's easier to reach people from many different cultures. On the other hand, expressing something through words can be harder to convey for people who speak different languages, but for those whose native language is Japanese, the message can come across more directly. So there are merits and demerits[1]. When it's a message that I really want to be conveyed properly through the medium of verbal language, then using words is the best. But on the other hand, when I feel like I don't really want to put this into words, or that I want to deliver it in a broader framework, I've started to think that maybe figure skating or physical expression is more appropriate. Also, when it's not a message like “I want you to understand only this one thing,” that's where I turn to expression. I often say in interviews that I want to be a catalyst. Like when you watch a movie or listen to music, those experiences turn into “your own story.” If you hear a song about heartbreak, it might make you think “My own heartbreak”. If it's a song about encouragement, it might make you think “the path I've walked so far"", or ""what I want to achieve from now on. "" I think skating should work the same way. And skating, since it uses no words, offers even more freedom. Even if I'm performing something sad, some people may be moved by the way I rise from that sadness, while others may focus on the sorrow itself and grieve along with me. That kind of emotional movement, I think physical expression is the best medium to ""trigger emotions. "" For me, expression doesn't exist for myself. What matters most is how it reaches the people I want to reach, and how they receive it. And once it reaches them, I don't think that's the end of it. I believe it keeps spreading, maybe it influences their lives in some way. I really care about those ripples and the movement that comes after *— That is the very concept of Echoes of Life. * Exactly. It's like the resonance of life, the ripples in the air that spread out from a performance. I'm always thinking about how those ripples might pass through someone else, and how they might continue to spread from there. *— You've also performed programs where you skate to poetry you've written yourself. A line like “Records document the past / What we must face is the future / [if this is ] The privilege of the living / Then, shall we make good use of it?” was particularly striking. *..."

From antique interiors curated by wife Tanya to Rs 1 crore luxury cars and Rs 90,000 sneakers, every corner oozes legacy and quiet opulence. It's not just a house—it's a living, breathing piece of Bollywood history. What's Inside Bobby Deol's Rs 60 Crore Home? A Rs 1 Cr Car Collection, Rs 70 Cr Net Worth and A-list Interior Decor (Images: Instagram) Inside BobbyDeol's Luxurious Lifestyle: There's something magical about Bollywood homes—how they seem to float between fantasy and reality, between lived-in warmth and the dazzle of the silver screen. But if there's one star residence that masterfully blends legacy, luxury, and lived-in charm, it's the iconicDharmendraHouse in Juhu, Mumbai. This palatial home isn't just a real estate flex or a backdrop for high-profile family weddings. It's a generational epic—one where walls whisper movie dialogues, staircases creak with family gossip, and courtyards hold stories longer than any movie script. Owned and inhabited by three generations of Deols—Dharmendra, Sunny, and Bobby Deol—this Rs 60 crore villa (As per GQ and The Financial Express) stands not only as a testament to their stardom but also their unwavering bond.From lavish gardens to sneaker closets that would put any Gen Z influencer to shame, every corner of this mansion is dripping in stories. Let's step inside—careful, though, you might bump into a piece of cinematic history. Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: A Gateway to Bollywood's Golden Age - The Grand Entrance The mansion first made a full public appearance during Karan Deol's wedding in 2023, when the property was dressed in fairy lights, floral cascades, and cinematic grandeur. But even beneath the frills of festivity, the entrance spoke of quiet luxury. Think heavy wooden doors, vintage lanterns, and subtle hints of handcrafted heritage. Yet, despite its opulence, the gate doesn't scream. It smiles. Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: Lush Lawns and Luxe Cars As Bobby revealed in an interview with Curly Tales, once you walk past the gate, you're greeted by a sprawling green lawn, lined with cane chairs, rustic décor, and pops of orange. It's not just pretty; it's peaceful. Parked beside this garden oasis is a lineup of cars that would make a Fast & Furious cast member jealous—Range Rovers, Porsches, and Mercedes-Benz S-Class, to name a few. Fun fact: Bobby owns a Range Rover Vogue, Porsche Cayenne, and a Land Rover Freelander 2. Each ride costs over Rs 1 crore.Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: Living Room Goals The Deol living room is less Bollywood glam, more vintage postcard. With L-shaped sofas, golden partition screens, antique chandeliers, and wooden artefacts, this room feels more like a curated museum than a celebrity lounge. But it's no showroom. The sofas have sunk slightly from use, the bookshelves are overflowing, and that's the charm—it's a room that's been lived in, argued in, and laughed in. Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: Elevated Living (Literally) - The Lift and Dining Area Most celebrity homes flaunt swanky lifts—but at Dharmendra House, it's a thoughtful detail. The in-house lift ensures comfort for elderly family members like Dharmendra, who's now in his late 80s. The adjacent dining area is sunny and breezy, with large glass windows and earthy wood panelling. It's not ostentatious but manages to stun with its sheer scale and serenity. Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: Bobby Deol's Den Surprisingly minimalist, Bobby's personal section of the house reflects none of his brooding screen avatars. Think: white walls, soft grey furniture, and ambient lighting. A large portrait of Bobby hangs nearby—calm, composed, and contemplative. It's not a movie star's room. It's a man's retreat. Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: Artefacts That Speak - Tanya Deol's Signature Touch Interior designer Tanya Deol has lent her artistic eye to every nook and cranny. From carved Indian panels to abstract sculptures, and classic lanterns, every piece tells a story. It's not the kind of house where you'd call a decorator. This home is the decorator's masterpiece. Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: A Joint Family Dream In an age of nuclear families and separate penthouses, the Deolsstill live together...."

Een daarvan was Daniel Craigs James Bond-film met een brutowinst van $ 880 miljoen. Spook . De grote regisseur weigerde het echter omdat hij wist dat Bond niets voor hem was. Waarom weigerde Nicolas Winding Refn om Daniel Craig's te regisseren Spook ? In een interview met De Telegraaf, Nicolas Winding Ref onthulde dat hij in gesprek was met de makers van James Bond-films, Eon Productions, voor Daniel Craig's Spook . Maar in de loop van verschillende vergaderingen besefte de directeur dat hij niet gemaakt was om een eigendom als James Bond te besturen, en dat het beter voor hem zou zijn om zijn eigen ding te doen. Hij zei: 'Ik weet gewoon dat ik op deze manier kan doen wat ik wil, en dat weegt zwaarder dan het geld dat iemand me kan geven.' Lees verder : 'Hey you, f*ck you': James Bond-ster Daniel Craig's eerste interactie was vernederend voor Batman-ster Anne Hathaway In 2016 was hij echter nog steeds betrokken bij de spionagewereld omdat hij met James Bond-schrijvers Neal Purvis en Robert Wade werkte aan een spionagethriller getiteld De wrekende stilte . De synopsis luidde: “ Een voormalige Europese spion accepteert een vertrouwelijke missie van een Japanse zakenman die naar Frankrijk is verbannen om het hoofd van de meest verraderlijke Yakuza-baas in Japan neer te halen. Die film zag echter niet het daglicht. Door de jaren heen is de populariteit van de Deense regisseur afgenomen, ook al maakte hij films met topsterren als Tom Hardy in Bronson (2008). Dus hoe kan hij zichzelf onderhouden als hij geen tentpole-regietaken op zich neemt? Refn had destijds uitgelegd dat het allemaal te danken was aan het regisseren van commercials voor bedrijven als Gucci, H&M en meer. Lees verder : 'Ik was volkomen geschokt en werd gewoon tegen de stoeprand geschopt': in tegenstelling tot Daniel Craig was Pierce Brosnan boos over hoe hij James Bond verliet Wie is de volgende voor James Bond? Nadat Nicolas Winding Refn het James Bond-project had verlaten, werd Sam Mendes aangetrokken om te regisseren Spook (2015). Maar het is jaren geleden en de volgende Bond-film, Geen tijd om te sterven (2021), door Cary Fukunaga, zag Daniel Craig verlaat de populaire spionagefranchise. Sindsdien zijn er intense speculaties geweest over wie de mantel van de beroemdste spion ter wereld zou kunnen opnemen. Namen als Henri Cavill , Idris Elba, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Tom Hardy en meer zijn rondgegooid. Maar er is geen officiële informatie van producenten als Michael G. Wilson en Barbara Broccoli over de volgende James Bond. Lees verder : 'Er was geen sprake van': Daniel Craig was bereid om een enorm James Bond-salaris van $ 85 miljoen te riskeren door één grote verandering in zijn uiterlijk te weigeren Toen Broccoli in 2022 een BFI Fellowship ontving, werd haar gevraagd naar de volgende Bond-film en ze zei: “We zijn aan het uitzoeken waar we met hem heen kunnen gaan, dat zijn we aan het bespreken. Er is geen script en we kunnen er ook geen bedenken totdat we hebben besloten hoe we de volgende film gaan benaderen, want het is echt een heruitvinding van Bond. We zijn opnieuw aan het uitvinden wie hij is en dat kost tijd. Ik zou zeggen dat het filmen nog minstens twee jaar duurt. Als zodanig lijkt het erop dat de officiële aankondiging nog minstens anderhalf jaar op zich laat wachten. Het valt nog te bezien wie er wordt gekozen, want het voortzetten van de erfenis van James Bond en de mantel van Daniel Craig zal moeilijk te evenaren zijn. Spook is beschikbaar op Amazon Prime Video. Bron : De Telegraaf"

Priyanka Chopra with husband Nick Jonas (File photo) Priyanka Chopra painted the town red as she stepped out on the streets of NYC in a plunging red dress, walking hand-in-hand with husband Nick Jonas, who looked dapper in a semi-formal look. The couple was seen exiting Emilio's Ballato along with Nick's family after celebrating the singer-actor's closing night of The Last Five Years. For the outing, Priyanka glammed up in a body-hugging halter dress — a knotted affair that looked rich with its drape and sheen. View this post on Instagram A post shared by Patty Cardona (@jerryxmimi)Story continues below Priyanka accessorised with black pointed-toe heels and carried a sleek black sling bag. Her hair was styled in a glamorous side-swept bun, and her makeup, a full face of glam, brought out her best features. Meanwhile, Nick wore a light grey double-breasted suit with subtle checks, paired with a graphic tee that added a casual touch. He completed the look with white sneakers and dark-rimmed sunglasses for a stylish appeal. Currently, Priyanka is busy promoting her upcoming film Heads of State, alongside Idris Elba and John Cena. Earlier in the day, she charmed fans in a mocha co-ord set with contemporary detailing. The shirt featured long sleeves, a high neckline with knotted tie details, and a few open buttons at the bottom for a relaxed look. She paired it with matching pants and closed-toe heels, adding dainty gold accessories and a brown bag to complete the ensemble.

mov_D6369FAEF8E45D8DF8283560E52AE398,2025-06-23 10:24:55,en,WEB,"  Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: There's something magical about Bollywood homes-how they seem to float between fantasy and reality, between lived-in warmth and the dazzle of the silver screen. But if there's one star residence that masterfully blends legacy, luxury, and lived-in charm, it's the iconic Dharmendra House in Juhu, Mumbai. This palatial home isn't just a real estate flex or a backdrop for high-profile family weddings. It's a generational epic-one where walls whisper movie dialogues, staircases creak with family gossip, and courtyards hold stories longer than any movie script. Owned and inhabited by three generations of Deols-Dharmendra, Sunny, and Bobby Deol-this Rs 60 crore villa (As per GQ and The Financial Express) stands not only as a testament to their stardom but also their unwavering bond. From lavish gardens to sneaker closets that would put any Gen Z influencer to shame, every corner of this mansion is dripping in stories. Let's step inside-careful, though, you might bump into a piece of cinematic history. Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: A Gateway to Bollywood's Golden Age - The Grand Entrance The mansion first made a full public appearance during Karan Deol's wedding in 2023, when the property was dressed in fairy lights, floral cascades, and cinematic grandeur. But even beneath the frills of festivity, the entrance spoke of quiet luxury. Think heavy wooden doors, vintage lanterns, and subtle hints of handcrafted heritage. Yet, despite its opulence, the gate doesn't scream. It smiles. Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: Lush Lawns and Luxe Cars As Bobby revealed in an interview with Curly Tales, once you walk past the gate, you're greeted by a sprawling green lawn, lined with cane chairs, rustic décor, and pops of orange. It's not just pretty; it's peaceful. Parked beside this garden oasis is a lineup of cars that would make a Fast & Furious cast member jealous-Range Rovers, Porsches, and Mercedes-Benz S-Class, to name a few. Funfact: Bobby owns a Range Rover Vogue, Porsche Cayenne, and a Land Rover Freelander 2. Each ride costs over Rs 1 crore. Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: Living Room Goals The Deol living room is less Bollywood glam, more vintage postcard. With L-shaped sofas, golden partition screens, antique chandeliers, and wooden artefacts, this room feels more like a curated museum than a celebrity lounge. But it's no showroom. The sofas have sunk slightly from use, the bookshelves are overflowing, and that's the charm-it's a room that's been lived in, argued in, and laughed in. Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: Elevated Living (Literally) - The Lift and Dining Area Most celebrity homes flaunt swanky lifts-but at Dharmendra House, it's a thoughtful detail. The in-house lift ensures comfort for elderly family members like Dharmendra, who's now in his late 80s. The adjacent dining area is sunny and breezy, with large glass windows and earthy wood panelling. It's not ostentatious but manages to stun with its sheer scale and serenity. Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: Bobby Deol's Den Surprisingly minimalist, Bobby's personal section of the house reflects none of his brooding screen avatars. Think: white walls, soft grey furniture, and ambient lighting. A large portrait of Bobby hangs nearby-calm, composed, and contemplative. It's not a movie star's room. It's a man's retreat. Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: Artefacts That Speak - Tanya Deol's Signature Touch   Interior designer Tanya Deol has lent her artistic eye to every nook and cranny. From carved Indian panels to abstract sculptures, and classic lanterns, every piece tells a story. It's not the kind of house where you'd call a decorator. This home is the decorator's masterpiece. Inside Bobby Deol's Luxurious Lifestyle: A Joint Family Dream In an age of nuclear families and separate penthouses, the Deols still live together. All of them. From Dharmendra and his wife Prakash Kaur to Bobby, Sunny, their respective wives Tanya and Pooja, their kids Aryaman, Dharam, Karan, and Rajveer-plus Dharmendra's sister and niece. This isn't just a house. It's a joint family multiverse, one where family dinners are events, and private space still coexists with shared love. Bobby Deol: Comeback King with Crores to Spare   Bobby Deol's career got a second wind with his terrifyingly silent role in Animal (2023), where he barely had dialogue but owned every frame he was in. He followed it up with his Tamil debut in Kanguva, squaring off against superstar Suriya. While the movie opened to mixed reviews, critics unanimously praised Bobby for his screen presence. His net worth? Rs 70 crore, according to GQ...."

mov_1ABF37584164E5B4B92FB7C8FA607BF9,2025-06-23 12:30:00,zh-tw,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[zh-tw]早兩星期講過，內地汽車股以至整條產業鏈被「零公里二手車」搞到雞毛鴨血，但另一邊廂，Labubu母公司泡泡瑪特（9992）卻因為Labubu的二手價被炒到飛天而屢創股價新高，市盈率一度升破100倍，帶動新消費股風潮。 但一間資產淨值只有110億元的公司，市值可以炒到高過Gucci母公司開雲集團，我認為，沽空的誘因大過高追。 跟另一隻新消費股老鋪黃金（6181）不同，泡泡瑪特不是半新股，該股於2020年上市，表現亦不是一帆風順，2022年曾經跌穿10元，較招股價38.5元下跌近80%，即使到去年初，其股價亦只是20元左右，但隨著公司成功將Labubu衝出國際，股價亦開始「起舞」，單計過去12個月，泡泡瑪特就由不足40元升過到歷史高位283.4元，大升超過6倍。 其實泡泡瑪特的商業模式並不複雜，以IP產品（Labubu為主）再結合「盲盒」銷售模式，成本極低，何解市場會有如此熾熱反應？ 就是炫富感，500元一隻公仔一出，轉頭升值到5,000元，甚至更高，兼且長期缺貨，邊個有就型到核爆。 此外，管理層亦確有諗頭，懂得利用名人效應加社交媒體做宣傳，連BLACKPINK的Lisa個手袋都要掛住個Labubu，其粉絲怎會不爭相盲搶？ 泡泡瑪特憑著炫富感與稀缺性成功捧紅Labubu，二手市場亦有價有市，但情況已開始失控，據報，泡泡瑪特於杭州的一間新店開業兩小時，所有貨品即被搶購一空，有黃牛黨派出數十人團隊參與搶購，其後再以10至30倍溢價在二手市場兜售，依然大受歡迎，有黃牛業內人士透露，炒賣Labubu一周就淨賺37萬元人民幣！ 盲盒的盲炒價不斷向上，自然有翻版貨出現，近日內地海關就檢獲2萬隻翻版Labubu，難怪連人民日報也要發聲，上周五發表頭版文章，批評盲盒及盲卡的營銷方式，當中盲卡在兒童及青少年之間流行，產品已超出簡單的收藏功能，甚至影響未成年人社交，文章雖然無點名泡泡瑪特，但市場即時有反應，該股周五一度跌6.6%，收市仍跌3.6%至239.6元，成交高達98億元。 泡泡瑪特上周五單日跌3.6%，但原來上周累挫12%，是該股兩年多來最大單周跌幅，相信與北水趁高位套利不無關係，返查資料，上周三開始北水連續三天淨沽泡泡瑪特，而且一日比一日沽得多，三天累計淨沽近12億元。 兩周前將泡泡瑪特的目標價由224元上調至302元的摩根士丹利，上周竟將泡泡瑪特從其重點關注的中國和香港市場股票名單中剔除，改為加入中國財險（2328），大摩無解釋剔出泡泡瑪特的原因，但有講加入財險的原因，其中一個是估值合理。 泡泡瑪特的市盈率雖「回落」至雙位數，但仍高達95倍，合理嗎？ 呂宇健

mov_A320552C1AEDD6D1547BE414C9966CB3,2025-06-23 12:33:27,en,WEB,"  The fashion industry often walks a tightrope with regards to IP: on one side lies the promise of global recognition for fashion-forward designs and on the other, the lurking threat of imitation. In fashion, originality is everything. But creativity without protection, is an open door to imitation. So how do couturiers keep ahead of the copycats? RELATED: MetaBirkins NFTs – the Bold Infringement on Hermès' Iconic Birkin Trade Mark The Importance of Branding It is well understood in fashion, that branding transforms a product from a mere item of clothing into a symbol of identity, status, and aspiration. A well-established trade mark carries with it a promise that resonates emotionally with consumers. Buyers don't pay for an article per se – the quality of the fabric or the stitching – they invest in what the brand represents. This perceived value creates brand loyalty, even at a price premium and despite the fact that competing products offer similar quality, function or form. They say that, in fashion, the label often is the luxury. The most valuable trade marks in fashion (rumoured tao be Louis Vuitton, Nike, Chanel and Hermes – to name but a few) have evolved into fashion power brands by ensuring that there is consistent quality, effective marketing, brand positioning, wide distribution footprint, and performance innovation. The Intersection of Creativity and Innovation Although fashion is mostly regarded as a purely aesthetic pursuit, in reality, it can be deeply technical and innovative. Designers are engineers of wearability and structure. This synergy is beautifully embodied in the designs of Salvatore Ferragamo: he rose to fame for the styling of luxury footwear, but he was also a prolific inventor, holding over 350 patents for everything from wedge heels to child-safe soles. His legacy illustrates an important point: fashion is fertile ground for inventions and innovative designs. Haute couture houses like Gucci, Chanel, and Dior understand this well. Gucci alone has registered hundreds of designs and inventions for handbags, watches, belts, and more. These registrations can be enforced, at least for a limited time, to keep copycats at bay and could form the backbone of licensing and other commercial transactions. Fashion in the Virtual Age While intellectual property (IP) rights have long been used to gain a competitive advantage in the fashion arena, more recently these rights are being tested in unprecedented digital contexts. In a first case of its kind, Hermès took on NFT artist Mason Rothschild over his “MetaBirkins” collection – digital caricatures of the famous Birkin handbag rendered in faux fur and sold as NFTs. Rothschild argued that the project was art, shielded by free speech. Hermès contended that it was trade mark infringement. Ultimately, the court agreed with Hermès. A jury found Rothschild had intentionally misled consumers into thinking the 'digital bags' were affiliated with the luxury brand. He was held liable for trade mark infringement, dilution, and cybersquatting​. This case sent shockwaves through both the fashion and tech industries, illustrating in no uncertain terms, that real-world trade marks extend into the virtual world. Trade marks can be protected from unauthorised use, not only in boutiques or on billboards, but also on blockchain and digital art platforms. The Counterfeit Crisis in the e-Marketplace While the metaverse presents new challenges, old ones persist in full force, especially with the rise of online commerce and side-hustle culture. Platforms like eBay, Amazon, Instagram, and TikTok have made it easy for anyone to launch a fashion storefront. But that accessibility has also supercharged the global trade in counterfeit goods. There can be no doubt that luxury knock-offs are big business. Counterfeits ride the coattails of brand reputation and consumer loyalty without bearing any of the costs of quality or innovation. As consumers chase luxury looks at discount prices, counterfeiters fill the gap by mimicking well-known labels at a fraction of the cost​. Some online marketplaces, like eBay for example, have taken a clear and unequivocal stance on counterfeiting: “We don't allow counterfeit items or unauthorized copies to be listed on eBay. Items sold using a brand name or a brand logo must be original and made by the brand or manufactured on their behalf. Software, music, movies and other media must be original and not unauthorized copies.” Amazon now offers a brand registry for vendors to enrol their brands, together with relevant trade mark information. The registry has several benefits for both brand holders and consumers alike. Brand owners are empowered to police for infringement of their trade marks using proprietary text and image searches on the platform. Amazon also uses advanced machine learning to implement “predictive protections” and then to block potentially infringing products from listing. Swift action against counterfeits enhances the credibility of the Amazon marketplace, which gives consumers the confidence to buy products without any nagging doubts as to their authenticity. The Fashion IP Frontier As fashion continues to evolve alongside innovation, the importance of intellectual property in protecting creativity will only deepen. Whether enforcing a monopoly in a technical innovation – wrinkle-resistant fabrics or wearable tech garments, for example – or protecting trade marks from infringement in the metaverse, the industry is learning to speak (a modern version of) the language of IP. Nowadays, fashion houses don't need to tolerate digital freeloaders and the battle against counterfeits and fakes on e-commerce platforms is only just getting started."

1lirf4z,2025-06-23 20:26:03,en,REDDIT,  It's so much easier for me to DoorDash in my car without ac than it is to make any sort of phone call. If it's a phone call I've made numerous times before and it's going to be exactly the same it'll be hard but I can do it. But if it's new or different or I just don't know what I expect it's so difficult for me. So even though there's a chance I might not have to pay the mortgage because I'm selling the house and going to pay it all at once. I'd still be more comfortable making my monthly payments until the house is sold. But the payment this month is a week late and itd take all the money my girlfriend and I (mostly her) have made. And some of it was money given to us my family to use for car repairs. Idk how to get over this block or to get her to be as okay with spending that money as I am. It's not like I'm trying to buy a Gucci bag or some shit. I'm just trying to pay my bills. I even suggested that I'll pick up more shifts. But since my glasses broke she won't let me drive at night when we get most of our orders. I feel so stuck right now.

I *know* she's a minor character, and I *know* she really only matters in *Goblet of Fire* — but Rita Skeeter has always been one of my favourite side characters. She's outrageous, nosy, manipulative, absolutely shameless… and I *loved* every second of her. That quill, that hair, those claws. She's the Daily Mail on legs, and she knows it. Now — given HBO's budget and their supposed commitment to more book-faithful adaptations (ahem), I want *flair*. I want tabloid filth. I want a walking headline in heels. I want a Rita who looks like she eats first-years for breakfast and sells the leftovers to *Witch Weekly*. And it hit me: why not Lady Gaga? Think about it.

I have yet to hear one positive story stemming from forced ECT treatments (except a couple on Reddit who were too new into it to know the damage it does) and it's alarming and unsettling how many lives are being made harder with this still in practice! I wish I could start a petition or something. Initially I thought the memory loss was temporary or only surrounding the ECT txs but now I know part of its purpose is to permanently erase memories. It's frightening to hear stories about myself from other people of times I forgot all about. Pretty gnarly. All I needed to do was get divorced and embrace being queer (and being loaded up on meds) and I was Gucci from there on out.

mov_7DB5E076DAD411535FC454B6DF5E8335,2025-06-23 22:18:26,en,WEB,"  Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez will tie the knot sometime this week during a three-day wedding celebration in Venice, Italy. This will be the second marriage for both the billionaire Amazon founder, 61, and the former journalist and pilot, 55, who have been engaged since 2023. The exact timing of the wedding has not been made public, but it's reportedly expected to take place sometime between Wednesday and Friday of this week, with People magazine suggesting the ceremony may be held on Bezos's $500 million super-yacht Koru, which will be anchored somewhere in the Venetian lagoon. The New York Times reports that the couple's nondenominational wedding ceremony will not be held at Venice's City Hall, due to Italy's rules around marriage rites. Approximately 200 guests are expected to attend, the New York Times reported. In addition to the couple's combined seven children from previous relationships, based on the couple's two engagement parties in 2023 and Sánchez's bachelorette party in May, other likely guests include Oprah Winfrey, Gayle King, Diane von Furstenberg, Kim Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Bill Gates and Ivanka and Jared Kushner. Bezos's yacht, Koru, moored in Théoule-sur-Mer in May near Cannes, France. (Thomas Kronsteiner/) A local source told the New York Times there were around nine visiting yachts that had requested to dock in Venice this week. The yachts were said to be associated with the upcoming wedding events, prompting protests by Venice residents and organizations like Greenpeace. “We have to block Bezos,” one protester told the New York Times. “We have to block this idea of this city as a tourist haven that has driven up housing costs so that most ordinary Venetians can no longer afford to live here.” Lanza & Baucina, the agency that planned Bezos and Sánchez's wedding, addressed protesters' concerns in a statement shared with Yahoo News. “From the outset, instructions from our client and our own guiding principles were abundantly clear: the minimising of any disruption to the city, the respect for its residents and institutions and the overwhelming employment of locals in the crafting of the events,” the statement said. The Associated Press, citing “people close to the couple,” also reported that Bezos and Sánchez have sought to pay tribute to the city by relying heavily on local vendors for the event. “Rumours of 'taking over' the city are entirely false and diametrically opposed to our goals and to reality,” Lanza & Baucina said in its statement. “No exaggerated quantity of water taxis or gondolas have ever been booked, the number of taxis reserved being proportionate for the number of guests.” City officials have also pledged that everything will function normally around the wedding. “We are mutually working and supporting the organizers, to ensure that the event will be absolutely respectful of the fragility and uniqueness of the city,” Venice Mayor Luigi Brugnaro said in a statement in March. Ahead of the big day, here's a look back at the evolution of Bezos and Sánchez's relationship. 2016-2018: Bezos and Sánchez first meet and decide to work together Bezos and Sánchez first met in December 2016 at the Amazon Studios party for Manchester by the Sea, a meeting that was documented in Brad Stone's book Amazon Unbound, according to Business Insider. Both of them were married to other people at the time. Two years later, Bezos hired Sánchez's company, Black Ops Aviation, to film promotional coverage for Blue Origin, his rocket company. Bezos, who was in a helicopter crash in 2003, credited Sánchez with making him feel more comfortable in the air, the Wall Street Journal reported. 2019: Reports of relationship with Sánchez surface hours after Bezos announces divorce Sánchez and Bezos at the Wimbledon Championships in July 2019. (Mike Egerton/) Bezos and his now ex-wife, MacKenzie Scott, issued a joint statement on Jan. 9, 2019, announcing their divorce after 25 years of marriage. Hours later, People magazine reported that Bezos and Sánchez were dating, citing unnamed sources. More in Celebrity On Jan. 10, the National Enquirer published leaked texts between Bezos and Sánchez, reportedly provided to the publication by Sánchez's brother in exchange for $200,000, sources told the Wall Street Journal. (The National Enquirer's 2019 article has since been taken down, but the New York Post also covered the relationship news at the time.) Bezos and Scott's divorce was finalized in April 2019, and Sánchez's now ex-husband, Patrick Whitesell, filed for divorce soon after that. January 2023: Sánchez gives Wall Street Journal first interview about relationship with Bezos Bezos and Sánchez attend the 10th annual LACMA Art+Film Gala presented by Gucci at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in November 2021. (Amy Sussman/) In an exclusive interview with the Wall Street Journal, Sánchez opened up about her personal and professional relationship with Bezos. “It's the greatest experience I've ever had,” she said. “I've always had a career very separate from my partner. I think now that I can work with my partner and be with him all the time. ... We love to be together and we love to work together. He's helping me with the book. He's getting his pilot's license. We fly together. We work out together. We're together all the time.” May 2023: Bezos proposes Sánchez subtly shows off her engagement ring as she holds Bezos's arm at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party in March 2024. (Taylor Hill/)..."

And while you think about that I'll tell you what white people created. Your correct the white man has created the things you've stated as much as any race has and also antibiotics, the phonograph, light bulbs, the printing press, hydro electric capabilities, the cotton gin which by the way is what really ended slavery in the United States after 150 years. And if you want to believe it was the civil war that ended slavery then it was no less then 700,000 whites died in the fight with 100s of thousands more wounded. No Africans stepped up to end the enslavement of Jews  for 5000 years by who,? oh ya Africans living in what's now called Egypt. Don't hear the Jews crying about how bad Africans treated their ancestors for 5000 years but you cry about something that you weren't even part of and no one you know was part of. Wanna blame someone for 150 years of enslavement blame the Africans again who gladly rounded up those of their own race to sell to the highest bidder who was alot of times yes you guessed it blacks hoping to gain fortune in the slave trade but I digress.

Sunny Hostin was chowing down during a cooking segment with former View co-host Debbie Matenopoulos, who was there to promote her new cookbook. Matenopoulos served the group some “wonderful” Greek food when her co-host Alyssa Farah Griffin said something that gave her cause for alarm. “I have a terrible allergy to walnuts, and as I'm eating the food, Alyssa asks, 'Are those walnuts in here?' And she says yes. So I panic immediately,” Hostin said on Friday's episode. She frantically wrote a “death note” to Alyssa before flagging down the show's executive producer Brian Teta. “I'm looking at Brian and he's like, 'Is everything OK?' No, it's not,” she said. Thankfully for the 56-year-old star, the show's medical team worked quickly to ensure nothing bad transpired. “Our Disney nurses are like superheroes,” she continued. “Nurse Jan came in with an EpiPen. She was testing me. I had Benadryl. I was scared.” As for Alyssa, she admitted she “couldn't read [the note] at first… but then I also wanted to be like, 'Would you leave me your Gucci shoes if you passed?'” Episodes of The View air at 11 am on ABC.

5abaa9d214524681f9fb0ae0eac823f0,2025-06-24 01:36:00,no,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[no]Kjendiser 'Det oppveier alle penger noen kan gi meg': Før Denis Villeneuve, nektet Nicolas Winding Refn Daniel Craigs James Bond-film på $880 millioner etter å ha blitt kult-klassisk regissør Nicolas Winding Refn og Daniel Craig? Den regissør-skuespillerduoen kunne vært en realitet hvis det hadde gått annerledes. Refn definerer ordet auteur og han passer rett inn i en verden av indiefilmer i stedet for de blitsende store Hollywood-teltstengene. Han brast inn i scenen med kult-klassikeren Kjøre (2011) og fortsatte deretter med å lage filmer som Bare Gud tilgir (2013) og Neondemonen (2016). Men som det ofte er med enhver regissør som bryter inn i scenen med en ny og ny film, ble også Refn tilbudt storfilmer. En av dem var Daniel Craigs James Bond-film med inntjening på 880 millioner dollar, Spekter . Imidlertid nektet den store regissøren det fordi han visste at Bond ikke var noe for ham. Hvorfor nektet Nicolas Winding Refn å regissere Daniel Craigs Spekter ? I et intervju med The Telegraph, Nicolas Winding Refn avslørte at han var i samtaler med skaperne av James Bond-filmer, Eon Productions, for Daniel Craigs Spekter . Men i løpet av flere møter innså direktøren at han ikke var skapt til å lede en eiendom som James Bond, og det ville være bedre for ham å gjøre sine egne ting. Han sa: 'Jeg vet bare på denne måten at jeg kan gjøre hva jeg vil, og det veier opp for pengene noen kan gi meg.' Les mer : 'Hei du, f*ck deg': James Bond-stjernen Daniel Craigs første interaksjon var ydmykende for Batman-stjernen Anne Hathaway Men tilbake i 2016 var han fortsatt involvert i spionverdenen fordi han jobbet med James Bond-forfatterne Neal Purvis og Robert Wade på en spionthriller med tittelen Den hevnende stillheten . Synopsisen lød: ' En tidligere europeisk spion aksepterer et konfidensielt oppdrag fra en japansk forretningsmann i eksil til Frankrike for å ta ned hodet til den mest forræderske Yakuza-sjefen i Japan.» Den filmen så imidlertid ikke dagens lys. Gjennom årene har den danske regissørens popularitet gått ned selv om han har laget filmer med toppstjerner som Tom Hardy Bronson (2008). Så hvordan forsørger han seg selv hvis han ikke tar tak i regijobber? Den gang hadde Refn forklart at alt var takket være å regissere reklamefilmer for selskaper som Gucci, H&M og mer. Les mer : 'Jeg ble helt sjokkert og ble bare sparket til fortauskanten': I motsetning til Daniel Craig, ble Pierce Brosnan forbanna over hvordan han forlot James Bond Hvem er neste for James Bond? Etter at Nicolas Winding Refn forlot James Bond-prosjektet, ble Sam Mendes hentet inn for å regissere Spekter (2015). Men det har gått år siden da og neste Bond-film, Ingen tid til å dø (2021), av Cary Fukunaga, så Daniel Craig forlate den populære spionserien. Siden den gang har det vært intense spekulasjoner om hvem som kan ta opp kappen til den mest kjente spionen i verden. Navn som Henry Cavill , Idris Elba, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Tom Hardy og flere har blitt kastet rundt. Men det har ikke vært noen offisiell informasjon fra produsenter som Michael G. Wilson og Barbara Broccoli om den neste James Bond. Les mer : 'Det var utelukket': Daniel Craig var klar til å risikere massive millioner James Bond-lønn ved å nekte en større endring i utseendet hans Da Broccoli ble presentert med et BFI Fellowship i 2022, ble hun spurt om den neste Bond-filmen, og hun sa: 'Vi finner ut hvor vi skal gå med ham, vi snakker igjennom det. Det finnes ikke et manus, og vi kan ikke komme opp med et før vi bestemmer oss for hvordan vi skal nærme oss neste film, fordi det egentlig er en gjenoppfinnelse av Bond. Vi gjenoppfinner hvem han er, og det tar tid. Jeg vil si at filmingen er minst to år unna.' Som sådan ser det ut til at den offisielle kunngjøringen fortsatt er minst ett og et halvt år av. Det gjenstår å se hvem som blir valgt fordi det vil være vanskelig å videreføre arven etter James Bond og Daniel Craigs kappe. Spekter er tilgjengelig på Amazon Prime Video. Kilde : The Telegraph"

mov_8C4B34AC201EC72D414730734BE0B770,2025-06-24 03:04:37,en,WEB,"  Netflix's latest movie KPop Demon Hunters is an absolute must-watch for anyone who believes that music can keep demons at bay—literally. Directed by Maggie Kang and Chris Appelhans, the hilarious and heartfelt animated film blends ancient Korean mythology and modern-day K-pop, as it follows HUNTR/X, a kick-ass girl group who protects the world from soul-sucking demons through their gorgeous voices and the love of their fans. When the demon king Gwi-ma sends a demon boy band to lure the fans into the underworld, singers Rumi, Mira, and Zoey have to fight to close the barrier between the human world and the demon world once and for all. To fill up the world of KPop Demon Hunters, Kang and Appelhans recruited an all-star cast of actors from across the U.S. and South Korea, as well as several talented musicians to provide the singing voices for this K-pop fueled fantasy epic. Below, read on to learn more about the speaking and singing voices for the beloved characters of KPop Demon Hunters. Arden Cho as Rumi (with vocals by EJAE) Rumi, the leader and main vocalist of HUNTR/X, is the latest in a lineage of heroes who use music to defend the mortal world from demons. Her mother was also a Hunter, but she died when Rumi was a baby. Rumi's sole mission in life is protecting her fans, but she's also hiding a massive secret. Arden Cho, 39, grew up in Texas and started her career as a model, singer, and actress. She first rose to fame as Kira on MTV's Teen Wolf, and also appeared on the shows Pretty Little Liars, Castle, and Chicago Med. In 2022, she starred on Netflix's short-lived legal drama Partner Track, before going on to play bounty hunter June on the streamer's live-action Avatar: The Last Airbender. For musical sequences, Rumi is voiced by EJAE, a Korean-American vocal producer and arranger who also wrote several of the film's songs. In addition to the film, EJAE has written for several of Korea's top groups, including Aespa, TWICE, Red Velvet, NMIXX, and KARD. May Hong as Mira (with vocals by Audrey Nuna) Mira (above, left), the visual and lead dancer of HUNTR/X, is a style icon and the rebellious ""black sheep "" of her wealthy family. Though she comes across as cold, she deeply cares about her friends and fans. May Hong is a model, actress, and visual artist who was born in South Korea and moved to the U.S. at the age of 6. She has walked in New York Fashion Week and worked with brands including Adidas, Gucci, Marc Jacobs, Telfar, and Eckhaus Latta. Her acting credits include Broad City, High Maintenance, Tales of the City, Hacks, and Fantasmas. Audrey Nuna, 26, provides Mira's singing voice. The singer-songwriter is best known for her critically acclaimed albums a liquid breakfast and TRENCH. Ji-young Yoo as Zoey (with vocals by Rei Ami) Zoey (above, right) is HUNTR/X's American-born rapper, lyricist, and maknae (a.k.a. youngest). Though she felt like an outsider growing up outside of L.A., she has found her place in her tight-knit group of friends. Ji-young Yoo, 25, was born in Denver, Colorado, and attended the University of Southern California in L.A. before pausing school to film the Prime Video miniseries Expats alongside Nicole Kidman. The Gotham Awards nominee has also appeared in the films Moxie, Smoking Tigers, Freaky Tales, and Until Dawn. She also provided the English dub for Eun-yu in the first season of the thriller K-drama Sweet Home. Rei Ami, 30, is a Seoul-born singer-songwriter who provides Zoey's singing and rap vocals. The genre-blending artist is best known for her debut mixtape FOIL, as well as appearing in the Savage X Fenty Show Vol. 2 in 2020. Ahn Hyo-seop as Jinu (with vocals by Andrew Choi) Jinu is the leader and mastermind behind The Saja Boys, a demon boy band aimed at stealing HUNTR/X's fans to destroy the barrier between worlds. Jinu was once a human living in Joseon-era Korea, before he sold his soul to Gwi-ma in exchange for money and fame. Ahn Hyo-seop, 30, is a Korean Canadian actor and singer making his voice-acting debut in KPop Demon Hunters. He made his K-drama debut in 2015 and went on to star in shows including Still 17, Abyss, Dr. Romantic, Lovers of the Red Sky, and A Time Called You. He's best known for playing Kang Tae-moo in the 2022 Netflix K-drama Business Proposal. Meanwhile, Andrew Choi, 44, is the singing voice of Jinu. The singer and composer began his career by placing third in the Korean reality show K-pop Star Season 2 in 2013. He has since composed songs for idol groups and soloists including Day6, NCT 127, Monsta X, and Taemin. Joel Kim Booster as Romance Saja (with vocals by samUIL Lee) Saja Boys member Romance (above, far right), who's best identified by his heart-shaped pink hair, is voiced by Joel Kim Booster, 37. The actor, writer, and comedian has appeared in shows including The Other Two, Shrill, Big Mouth, Search Party, Loot, and Industry. In 2022, he wrote, executive-produced, and starred in Fire Island, a gay rom-com adaptation of Pride and Prejudice. Songwriter samUIL Lee, who provides Romance's singing voice, has worked with K-pop artists including Seventeen, RIIZE, Peniel of BTOB, and NCT Dream. Alan Lee as Mystery Saja (with vocals by Kevin Woo) Mystery Saja (above, far left), whose silver hair obscures his face throughout the movie, is played by Alan Lee. The California-born voice actor has worked on dozens of live-action and animated shows and movies, including Past Lives, Solo Leveling, The First Slam Dunk, One Piece, One Punch Man, and Scott Pilgrim Takes Off...."

e799c2b8e272eadb3ae76bbc429c9dde,2025-06-24 04:03:00,en,WEB,"  This week, I checked in on the burgeoning beauty supplement category. Additionally, Unilever is set to acquire men's personal care leader Dr. Squatch, there's another exec shakeup at Violet Grey, and Beautycounter founder Gregg Renfrew is back with Counter. The beauty supplement marketplace is expanding again Part of this growth is driven by consumer behavior formed during the Covid-19 pandemic. “In 2019, retail sales were at $26.2 billion [for vitamins and supplements], but as the pandemic pushed health and immunity into the spotlight, the market surged by 22.1% to reach $32 billion in 2020,” David Hamlette, health and wellness research analyst at Mintel market research company, told Glossy. “This initial boom continued into 2021, with sales climbing to $34.8 billion. However, as pandemic-related concerns began to ease, so did the rapid growth.” The market slowed significantly in 2022, up just 0.6%, followed by 3.5% growth in 2023 to reach $36.2 billion. Growth in 2024 is estimated to have been around 3.2%. “While the explosive growth of the early pandemic period has tapered off, the category has now stabilized and continues to see a gradual, sustainable rise,” Hamlette said. “The good news is that consumer interest in health and wellness remains strong.” For some brands, reaching this evolving supplement consumer means adding beauty benefits into the mix. The beauty supplement category has traditionally included vitamins and drink mixes benefitting the hair, skin and nails but has more recently grown to include supplements targeting cellular health, the microbiome and gut, all of which impact our outward appearance. “Beauty and wellness is collapsing in on each other,” Henry Davis, CEO of Sakara Life, told Glossy. “It is an artificial divide that retailers have put in place.” Davis — who led Glossier as president and COO from 2014 to 2018 and joined meal delivery company Sakara in 2023 — has big ambitions for the beauty category. On Monday the company launched Beauty Biome, a $65 daily capsule supplement that targets gut health for healthier skin, at the retailer Credo. “Over 90% of our clients have been asking us for supplements and over 75% have been asking us for beauty [offerings],” Davis said. Sakara debuted its supplement line in February with offerings that target cell health, sleep and metabolism. But Beauty Biome, and its distribution through Credo, is a more direct leap into beauty. “We're very focused on an all-body [approach], and the biggest organ in your body is skin, so that's something we're obviously very focused on and interested in,” Davis said. “It's a very natural and obvious opportunity for us to do more [in beauty], and Beauty Biome is our step in that direction. [We're] really trying to collapse these categories in on each other and be the people that tell that story.” But the merging of beauty and wellness isn't necessarily new. For example, L'Oréal-backed Timeline, a Swiss company launched in 2020 and known for a proprietary molecule said to increase cell longevity through ingestibles, launched a line of moisturizers called Timeline Skin Health in 2023 to complement its oral supplements. A representative for the brand told Glossy that Timeline has seen high double-digit growth so far this year. That's partially been driven by its newest launch, The Eye Cream, which retails DTC for $150 and is powered by the same anti-aging compound found in its vitamins. According to Mintel market research company, just under half of supplement users surveyed this year have also taken a beauty supplement. However, the majority of beauty supplement consumers surveyed agree that regular health supplements are just as effective in maintaining their appearance. “Beauty supplements are currently perceived as a 'nice-to-have.' … To establish itself as a 'must-have', the category will need to advance science-backed messaging and demonstrate proven effectiveness,” Joan Li, beauty and personal care senior analyst at Mintel, told Glossy. “High-income adults, particularly those aged 55 and older, are showing a growing interest in products designed to promote anti-aging benefits, improve skin firmness and boost elasticity,” said Mintel's Hamlette. Many oral vitamin brands have also expanded the beauty supplement category. For example, MaryRuth Organics, a liquid vitamin line launched in 2014, entered the beauty supplement space in 2022 with a biotin hair gummy followed by a $75 sugar-free liquid vitamin for hair health the next year. The latter is currently a bestseller, and in April, the company expanded the line to include new flavors. This offering has been clinically tested to improve hair growth and reduce fine lines and wrinkles. Collaborations and partnerships have also been category drivers. For example, Skin Laundry, the laser facial provider, and Nutrafol, the beauty supplement brand backed by Unilever, just announced a new partnership to promote an inside-outside acne treatment protocol. It includes a recommendation for laser treatments and oral supplements. The campaign, which will run through August, includes special promotions for brand clients who patronize the partnering brand. As previously reported by Glossy , vitamin therapy was first used in Western medicine in the early 1900s to treat issues like rickets or scurvy, but it wasn't until the 1970s that vitamins gained mass popularity. The category is projected to reach $239 billion by 2028, according to Research and Markets . Executive moves: Tracy Kline is the new group president of specialty beauty retailer and content site Violet Grey. Her CV includes nine years at Macy's-owned Bluemercury, most recently as its head of merchandising and spa. Byredo founder Ben Gorham is leaving the brand. Gorham founded the luxury fragrance brand in 2006 and sold it to Spanish beauty conglomerate Puig in 2022. Luca de Meo is the new CEO of Gucci-owner Kering. He previously served as CEO of carmaker Renault Group. François-Henri Pinault previously held the CEO role at Kering and will stay on as chairman of the board of directors...."

Created by designer Aldo Drudi (inspired by Leonardo da Vinci and Niccolò Machiavelli), the livery blends art and engineering. The story unfolds in Florence: from the historic Stibbert Museum, where ancient armor meets modern racing suits, to Piazza della Signoria, where Ducati's bikes stand among timeless masterpieces, beneath Michelangelo's David and the grandeur of Palazzo Vecchio. This unique project turns Francesco Bagnaia and Marc Márquez into modern-day knights, riding their Desmosedici GP. This livery is more than design. It's a celebration of Italian identity, where engineering meets elegance, and the past inspires the future. @drudi_performance @cittadifirenze. cultura @museostibbertofficial @stefanoguindani @gucci @loewe #Ducati #MadeInItaly #MuseiCiviciFiorentini #DucatiLenovoTeam #ItalianGP #Motogp #ForzaDucati"

mov_567D8494CC4C44CF3E758FD8E2562B34,2025-06-24 07:43:37,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]He aquí nuestro manual de TODO lo que necesitas saber –y cómo triunfar– en las rebajas de verano 2025 Las rebajas de verano ya están aquí. Esta es, sin lugar a dudas, una de las fechas más esperadas de todo el año –junto al Amazon Prime Day y el Black Friday– para hacerte con tus favoritos (de moda, belleza, tecnología, estilo de vida…) a un precio mucho más bajo. Y es que cuándo se acerca el buen tiempo, y con ello, el cambio de armario, rondan por nuestra cabeza multitud de preguntas sobre esos días de descuentos: cuándo empiezan, hasta cuando estarán, cuándo estarán disponibles en marca… Por lo que aquí podrás conocer las respuestas, y todo lo que necesitas saber sobre las próximas rebajas de verano. ¿Cuándo empiezan las rebajas de verano 2025? Por lo general, era el primer día de julio el que marcaba el comienzo oficial de las rebajas de verano. Sin embargo, cada vez es más habitual que las marcas se adelanten a esta fecha, sobre todo en sus plataformas online. En el grupo Inditex –que incluye Zara, Massimo Dutti, Stradivarius, Oysho, Pull&Bear, Zara Home, Lefties…– los descuentos estarán disponibles desde el miércoles 25 de junio de forma online (en la app y web). Aunque no será hasta el día siguiente, jueves 26 de junio, que estarán disponible en las tiendas físicas, concretamente, a partir de su apertura a las 10.00. No obstante, para los que no quieren esperar más, prácticamente todas las webs del grupo han habilitado una sección denominada Special Price, en la que desde ya puedes hacerte con diferentes productos con descuento. Pero, ¡ojo! , los productos de está sección (a ese precio) solo estarán disponibles hasta el 24 o 25 de junio. En el caso de Mango es algo más complejo. Actualmente, al igual que el grupo Inditex, cuenta con una sección (en su caso denominada 'Promoción') en la que puedes encontrar algunos de sus productos ya con descuento. Pero desde el domingo 22 de junio, contaremos sus 'ventas privadas', únicamente para los miembros del programa 'Mango Likes'. Aquí, los miembros, pueden conocer cuáles serán los artículos que se encontrarán rebajados en los próximos días, y aunque todavía se desconozcan los precios y con que porcentaje de descuento contará cada artículo, ya se podría añadir a la wishlist y radar de compras. Si bien, será el miércoles 25 de junio cuando den por comenzadas las rebajas de manera oficial (y en todos sus canales de venta, incluido las tiendas físicas) para todo el mundo. Mientras que, firmas como H&M, Ba&sh, & Other Stories, Rat&Boa o Arket, ya han dado el pistoletazo de salida, ofreciendo muchas de tus prendas y accesorios con rebajas que llegan hasta casi el 80% de descuento. Aunque El Corte Inglés, no ha querido quedarse atrás, y también ha dado la bienvenida a estas rebajas de verano en todas sus secciones y con descuentos que, en algunos casos, superan el 70%. Además, un dato un poco desconocido pero importante es que, por ejemplo, en el caso de H&M, sus artículos cuenta con mayor descuento en la página web, que en tienda. Asimismo, en el sitio web de otras tiendas como son Farfetch, Net-A-Porter y MyTheresa, los descuentos ya están activo, pudiendo hacerte con tus favoritos en cualquier momento. Además, estas plataformas disponen de multitud de marcas de lujo –como Gucci, Loewe, Bottega Veneta, Oscar de la Renta, Hermès, Chanel…– con irresistibles descuentos. ¿Hasta cuándo estarán disponibles los descuentos de verano? La realidad es que nunca hay una fecha concreta estipulada. Cada vez son más las marcas que extienden sus descuentos durante todo el verano, e incluso, que a medida que van pasando las semanas, empiezan a incluir más productos a las rebajas (y en algunos casos, aumentándole el porcentaje de descuento). Por lo que sí, podremos disfrutar de las rebajas más de dos meses, hasta finales de agosto. ¿Qué marcas se sumarán a estas rebajas? Las rebajas de verano se encuentran entre los mejores momentos de todo el año para hacerte con tus favoritos a un precio más bajo. Sin embargo, para poder aprovechar al máximo cada compra, es imprescindible saber cuáles son las marcas que se suman a esta temporada. Para los que buscan aprovechar los descuentos en moda, este es si momento. Entre las tiendas favoritas, sin duda, se encuentra el grupo Inditex (Zara, Massimo Dutti, Stradivarius, Pull&Bear…), con el que siempre siempre arrasan. Además, entre las más deseadas también destacan Mango, H&M, Ba&sh, Parfois, & Other Stories o Rat&Boa. Aunque, si lo que buscas es invertir en artículos de marcas de lujo no pueden faltar Farfetch, MyTheresa, Net-A-Porter o Luisviaroma, las tiendas online multi-marcas. También, para los que busquen artículos de decoración a un mejor precio, tienen que tener bajo su radar, indudablemente, las marcas Westwing, Maison Du Monde, H&M Home o Zara Home. Mientras que si eres un apasionado de la belleza y el cuidado de la piel, tienes que poner el ojo sí o sí en las tiendas de Sephora, Druni y Cult Beauty. Las tres cuentan con diversas marcas y suelen aplicar grandes descuentos que merecen mucho la pena. Tanto en productos de maquillaje como bases, máscaras de pestañas o gloss; hasta de skincare como sérums, cremas, parches o gadgets de belleza; pasando, incluso, por perfumes y suplementos alimenticios, como el colágeno. Consejos para aprovechar (al máximo) los descuentos de verano Algo muy recurrente cuando se dan estas fechas es incluir en nuestra cesta online –o física– muchos artículos solo 'porque están a un precio muy bajo', pero eso es un grave error. Después, la mayoría de esas prendas (o accesorios) son los que se quedan con la etiqueta colgada o los que usas una vez y adiós, porque al final son cosas que no querías o no te hacían falta. Por lo que, para evitar todas esas compras impulsivas y aprovechar de verdad estas fechas, aquí te dejamos 'el manual definitivo' para comprar de forma inteligente en momentos de rebajas. 1. El momento wishlist Consiste en anotar que artículos necesito, en el caso de la moda, por ejemplo, cuáles son las prendas que necesito para un armario cápsula (un pantalón denim blanco, un vestido versátil…); así como para apostar por tendencias, que no sabes si pueden llegar a ser pasajeras o no (como unas bermudas XL, prendas en butter yellow, unas sandalias jelly, una falda lencera…). Aunque, por otro lado, también es importante incluir en la wishlist todas aquellas cosas en las que merece la pena invertir en estas fechas: accesorios de firmas de lujo (como un bolso, reloj o joyas), artículos tecnológicos (como un móvil, ordenador, auriculares o una tablet) o productos de skincare que rara vez bajan de precio (gadgets de belleza, tratamientos…). 2. Qué marcas tener en cuenta En base a todos los productos que tenemos anotados en nuestra wishlist, y conociendo las firmas que se unen a 'las rebajas de verano', ahora solo toca anotar dónde podrías encontrar cada cosa, para saber por dónde empezar a buscar los diferentes artículos. Por ejemplo, si estás en busca de un bolso de firma de lujo, deberás incluir: Farfetch, Mytheresa, Net-A-Porter o Luisaviaroma. 3...."

This trend is characterized by luxury goods and services that are accessible to a wider audience without compromising on quality or prestige. Indian consumers are seeking premium products that reflect their lifestyle, status, and personal taste, with a growing demand for unique, limited, and sought-after collections. The masstige market in India is expected to continue growing, with a projected growth rate of 10% over the next five years, exceeding $200 billion by 2030. Brands like Good Earth, Nicobar, and Nappa Dori are popular choices among Indian consumers seeking premium and sustainable products. As consumers become more discerning and demanding, luxury brands will need to adapt to changing preferences and priorities, including sustainability and exclusivity. Keywords Masstige, Indian luxury market, digital consumers, sustainability, craftsmanship, personalization, aspirational demographic, global luxury slowdown, artisanal ecosystem, Made in India Introduction The global luxury goods market, valued at $286.10 billion in 2024 and expected to reach $405.80 billion by 2033, growing at a CAGR of 3.76%, is experiencing a slowdown in certain segments. However, India's luxury market is poised for growth, driven by a young and aspirational demographic, rising affluence, and increasing demand for premium products. Despite the global slowdown, India's luxury market is expected to grow at an annual rate of 10% over the next five years, exceeding $200 billion by 2030. This growth is driven by the rising affluence. India's growing middle class, with increasing disposable income, is driving demand for luxury goods and experiences. The Young and Aspirational Demographic with over 65% of its population under 35, India boasts a young and dynamic consumer base, prioritizing experiences, personalization, and exclusivity. Evolving Luxury: India's Cultural Edge and Masstige Opportunity Global Luxury Market Trends is mainly dominated by Asia Pacific region holding a revenue share of 39.9% in 2024, driven by increasing disposable incomes and a growing middle class. The Apparel accounting for 25.9% of global revenue in 2024, driven by product innovation, exclusivity, and evolving fashion trends. The most valuable luxury brands in 2024 include Porsche, valued at $43.117 billion, followed closely by Louis Vuitton at $32.235 billion, and Chanel at $26.068 billion. Hermès and Gucci also rank high, with valuations of $16.676 billion and $14.864 billion, respectively. These iconic brands have established themselves as leaders in the luxury market, known for their exceptional quality, craftsmanship, and timeless appeal. While the Indian luxury market holds immense potential, it also poses challenges. Luxury brands need to balance pricing strategies to cater to India's price-conscious consumers. The strict regulations require local partnerships, which can deter foreign luxury brands from entering the Indian market. By understanding the unique challenges and opportunities, luxury brands can capitalize on India's growth story and establish a strong foothold in this dynamic market. India's luxury market is a mindset that needs to be understood rather than a market that needs to be “entered.” The challenge for international luxury brands is not only to navigate strict FDI regulations and skyrocketing import taxes, but also to rethink what luxury means in India and reevaluate their initial expectations of what it should look like. The demand is genuine, but it is encased in paradox: a buyer who worships tradition but consumes hypermodern, who purchases luxury but looks for purpose, and who drives a Mercedes but haggles over MRP. Where and how luxury is consumed in India is where the real change is occurring. Delhi and Mumbai's influence as centres of luxury is eroding. The next generation of luxury customers isn't just exploring Emporio's marble floors; they're also perusing Instagram in places like Indore, Coimbatore, and Guwahati, yearning for experiences that align with their values and goals. The Western luxury playbook doesn't work here. Retail reimagining is required, not just expansion, with flagship stores serving as both physical locations and digital ecosystems that are rich in regional aesthetics, local language, and cultural codes. Although regulatory constraints, high taxes, and disorganized infrastructure may appear to be obstacles, they can also be reframed as an appeal to reorganize the luxury value chain, beginning with manufacturing in India. International brands have a strong chance to base their production within India's centuries-old artisanal ecosystems rather than paying a premium to import finished goods. and pricing for belonging, as well as affordability. Costs can be cut by sourcing and producing in India, but more significantly, it provides authenticity, which is something that customers around the world are beginning to value more. India offers unrivalled material culture and skilled human capital, from the leather craftsmen of Dharavi to the brocade weavers of Varanasi, from the intricate hand embroidery of Lucknow to the metal artisans of Moradabad, often at a fraction of the cost, but with unmatched finesse. Imagine the possibilities if global brands considered India as a co-creative partner as well as a sourcing destination: a Dior lehenga woven in Banaras, a Gucci bag featuring illustrations by Pattachitra, or a Hermès scarf block-printed in Bagru, each piece carrying not only aesthetic but also emotional and geographical depth. However, authenticity, sustainability, and innovation are more important than cost-effectiveness. “Made in India” can be a mark of soul and storytelling in a time when aware consumers want to know where, how, and by whom their products are made. In addition to improving their ethical reputation, brands that emphasize these origins use cultural intelligence to capitalize on the rising demand for luxury around the world. Additionally, this creates a huge masstige opportunity: luxury brands can reach India's aspirational yet budget-conscious consumer base by co-creating mid-tier, culturally rich, and design-forward collections produced in India. This market is looking for identity, craftsmanship, and meaning rather than logos. Brands can grow without compromising their values by investing in Indian craftsmanship and providing affordable luxury lines with strong local appeal. In the end, the Indian luxury market requires brands to become deeply rooted in the Indian culture rather than just localizing. The key to success will be creating a luxury that feels personal, welcoming, and distinctly Indian rather than trying to emulate Parisian extravagance...."

O casal deve trocar alianças nesta semana na famosa cidade turística, em uma cerimônia para cerca de 200 convidados, incluindo nomes como Mick Jagger e Katy Perry. O risco do chamado “overtourism”, no entanto, tem causado desconforto na população. Vem entender melhor o caso! Lauren Sánchez e Jeff Bezos devem se casar nos próximos dias em Veneza, na Itália Receios dos moradores Residentes de Veneza temem que o evento e a presença massiva de celebridades estimulem o turismo em massa e atrapalhem o fluxo tradicional de moradores. Nas manifestações, um cartaz exibiu o nome de Bezos riscado com um X, enquanto outro dizia “Se você pode alugar Veneza para o seu casamento, você pode pagar mais impostos”. Além dos cidadãos, organizações como o Greenpeace têm apoiado e participado dos protestos. “Enquanto os governos falam sobre escolhas difíceis e lutam para financiar serviços públicos, Jeff Bezos pode se dar ao luxo de fechar metade de uma cidade por dias a fio só para se casar”, disse um porta-voz da Everyone Hates Elon à Variety. Cartaz de protesto com o Greenpeace e a Everyone Hates Elon em 23 de junho, com a frase: “Se você pode alugar Veneza para o seu casamento, você pode pagar mais impostos” “Sem espaço para Bezos”, diz este banner na Ponte de Rialto, em foto de 13 de junho Aqui, um convite a uma manifestação contra Bezos marcada para 28 de junho A frase remete a um movimento contra o bilionário norte-americano Nome do empresário riscado com um X em outro cartaz O que diz a prefeitura da cidade Para o prefeito local, Luigi Brugnaro, “será fácil acomodar tal evento, sem qualquer perturbação para a cidade, seus moradores e visitantes”, assegurou. “Desde o início, estamos trabalhando e apoiando mutuamente os organizadores para garantir que o evento seja absolutamente respeitoso à fragilidade e à singularidade da cidade.” A celebração, avaliada em US$ 10 milhões, deve durar três dias e está prevista para ocorrer até 28 de junho. De acordo com a imprensa internacional, para valorizar o comércio da cidade, 80% dos materiais de fornecedores são de Veneza. Jeff Bezos e Lauren Sánchez já foram casados antes e ficaram noivos em 2023. Na galeria abaixo, entenda a linha do tempo do relacionamento do casal: Outros casamentos Vale lembrar que a cidade italiana já foi palco de casamento de outras personalidades conhecidas a nível global, como da atriz Salma Hayek com o magnata François-Henri Pinault, que comanda o grupo de luxo dono da Gucci.

mov_A269574C704072046C61054542FCE29C,2025-06-24 17:45:02,en,WEB,"  Fire Island, the holiday destination near New York, has been associated with the LGBTQ+ community since the thirties. It has inspired books (Edmund White's 1973 novel, Forgetting Elena), a 2022 eponymous romcom and now, a fashion show for Saint Laurent. Taking place at Paris fashion week in 30 degree heat more suited to a vacation, the show notes named the beach spot as a reference for the creative director, Anthony Vaccarello. They placed the show “somewhere between Paris and Fire Island, where escape becomes elegance, and desire becomes a language”. The collection started with this mood: the first look was a pair of short shorts worn with a silk shirt and sunglasses. There's little doubt this shape will be on trend for men next year, with Prada also showing it in their show in Milan last week. But as well as beach-ready items, the detail of shorts found their way on to the waistband of tailoring and pastel colours ideal for summer. There was a lot of workwear too, but rather than the more relaxed kind found in most offices in 2025, these designs committed to the same extreme eighties power-dressing shoulders seen in Vaccarello's hit womenswear collection shown earlier this year. Striped shirts and ties, trenchcoats and suits were included, often in the jewel tones associated with the brand. Every model wore sunglasses. As well as complementing the holiday feel and the weather outside, there was also a commercial angle: these are the entry-level designs customers can purchase before they can afford a suit. The show took place in the grand Bourse de Commerce, an ex-stock exchange where the art collection of François Pinault – the original owner of Saint Laurent's parent company, Kering – has been housed since 2021. The models walked around an installation called Clinamen by Céleste Boursier-Mougenot, which resembled the kind of swimming pool found on holidays. Although the text clarified that the collection was not nostalgic – “not homage. Not memory. Continuity” – it was coupled with an image of a young Yves Saint Laurent wearing short shorts on a tennis court in Oran in Algeria, taken around 1950, when the designer was a teenager. It also namechecked artists Stanton, Angus and Ellis – presumably Larry Stanton, Patrick Angus and Darrel Ellis – all of whom documented LGBTQ+ life in the seventies and eighties, with Stanton a regular on Fire Island. If this collection had a subtle tribute to a time and place, Vaccarello's Saint Laurent also excels at the kind of splashy moments that fuel the internet, and keep a brand in the fashion conversation in 2025. This month alone, 82-year-old Christopher Walken appeared in their advertising campaign – a clever move at a time when older legends are appreciated in fashion – and Rihanna, forever influential for her style, was spotted wearing the brand's clothes. The thigh-high patent waders that were in the January men's shows have also caused something of a sensation – with both Pedro Pascal and designer Marc Jacobs wearing them recently. Even with this profile, the brand – like many luxury brands – is seeing a decline in sales. A report of financial results across the Kering group for the first quarter of 2025 shows revenue was down 9%. This figure puts it in the middle of its stablemates, with Gucci's revenue down 25% and Bottega Veneta's revenue up by 4%. Kering announced Luca de Meo as the new CEO this month, and the man now charged with improving brand performances. Unusually for fashion, de Meo's experience is from a different sector - he was previously CEO of Renault cars. However, the industry seems to approve of the appointment. In the run-up to the announcement, the group's stock rose by 13%."

The occasion? Jeff Bezos is getting married. Awww. The apocalypse wears a tuxedo. While millions of people practice austerity, the gods of the new oligarchy fly off to indulge their vanity. ""Yes"" is proclaimed there with burning kerosene. Not »yes« to responsibility. But to decadence. To disrespect for the world and humanity. This wedding is a war crime against the future, decorated with silk napkins and served on a silver platter. The lagoon city, a symbol of a sinking world, becomes the backdrop for a spectacle where climate catastrophe and capitalism dance hand in hand. And in the meantime: the plebs. You. Me. Us. We are supposed to turn off the light when we leave the room while they stir the Gulf of Venice with their yacht like a Bloody Mary. And then they tell us with a stone-faced expression that people on welfare are the problem. Not the billionaires, not the tax system with its loopholes. No, it must be the lazy poor. The unemployed with broken shoes. Yet a single one of those jet flights is enough to blow the CO₂ budget of 10,000 people. But no one cares about that. Because outrage is only socially acceptable when it is directed downwards. This is class fight in Gucci. And us? We are still supposed to say thank you that the drinking straws are now biodegradable. This wedding is not an isolated case; it is the manifesto of the moral meltdown of a society that forgives the rich everything. https://www.facebook.com/share/p/19Aht3kk9v/"

mov_4A924AB7BED3D4298FA93472A9F51703,2025-06-24 20:13:39,en,WEB,"  When the majority of my high school friends selected bandage dresses for prom junior year, I was less than thrilled. I knew for sure I wouldn't be partaking, and that I'd be in something looser-fit, but I still felt an overwhelming sense of FOMO (as one does in high school). Watching everyone else jump on the bandage dress bandwagon was stressful, knowing I simply didn't have the confidence to wear something that so visibly traced every line of my body. Fast forward to college and I finally invested in a bandage skirt (pictured above), but this is the only photo I have to show for it as I remember feeling uneasy about my head-to-toe appearance. And maybe that's why, 20 years later, I was apprehensive to try a trend that used to keep me up at night. A familiar sense of fear creeped over me as I pulled the Hervé Léger Elise Dress ($690) over my head and procrastinated peering into the mirror. Would I like the shape of my thighs? Would I be able to make out my period bloat belly straight-on, before even turning to the side? All the same ridiculous questions popped into my head as I asked myself why I signed up to try the skintight silhouette that's enjoying a resurgence thanks to models like Kaia Gerber and Hailey Bieber. The design carries a certain energy that harks back to an early aughts party vibe, but feels versatile all the same. But then I looked at myself, and suddenly, my 33-year-old common sense and wisdom returned back to me. All my insecurities about wearing a tight dress (most of which society imparts on us) melted away - and not just because I actually liked the way I looked. While the idea of a bandage dress feels nostalgic, I felt very much like current-day me trying on a new aesthetic. Rather than being intimidated by the cut of the iconic mini, I was inspired to create a personal look that incorporated my favorite accessories du jour. This is, in part, because the Hervé Léger dress is comfortable (more on that in a bit) and because its construct and very intention has evolved. ""The original bandage dress was a study in form and discipline,"" creative director Michelle Ochs tells Popsugar. ""Hervé's vision was to sculpt the body like a piece of art - his use of paneled, knit strips drew from couture techniques and a fascination with shape and structure. It wasn't just about sex appeal; it was about strength, symmetry, and empowerment. Over the past four decades, the silhouette has evolved with changing attitudes about femininity and self-expression. We're no longer bound by the idea of perfection - it's about ease, versatility, and individuality."" Now, having worn the dress for a dinner date with my fiancé at Williamsburg hot spot Sungold, Ochs's sentiment very much resonates with me. Rather than being worried about defining lines, I felt confident in emphasizing my shape because it's mine. That change in perspective certainly took some time, but here we are 20 years later - when bandage dresses are so back - and I'm finally ready to offer my review. Expert Featured in This Article Michelle Ochs is the creative director of Hervé Léger and founder of Et Ochs. About the Hervé Léger Bandage Dress The dress is cut from gradient bandage paneling that's softer and more fluid than past designs. With a halter neckline, it's made to contour the body in zones of compression and release, lifting and shaping without boning or lining. It's made from 91 percent eco-friendly recycled rayon, eight percent nylon, and one percent spandex. It's available in bright blue or black and sizes XXS to XL. You can split your purchase into four interest-free payments through Klarna. What I Like About the Hervé Léger Bandage Dress At first touch, I was surprised by the clear quality and weight of Hervé Léger's bandage dress material. It doesn't feel at all like my old bandage skirts from college, which were stiff and paper-thin. Ochs explains, ""While the DNA remains, today's bandage is softer, more fluid, and reinterpreted through mixed media, matte jersey, and architectural tailoring. It's no longer just a dress, it's an attitude."" In that regard, I definitely felt like my personal style was challenged the moment I slipped into The Elise. The design carries a certain energy that harks back to an early aughts party vibe, but feels versatile all the same - like I could easily team it with my vintage Gucci sandals and Jacquemus Rond Carré Shoulder Bag ($119 a month at Vivrelle) and still feel like me. While it definitely formed to my curves, which made me a bit self-conscious as I feasted on bucatini, strip steak, and focaccia, it simultaneously lifted with support, keeping that ""snatched"" feeling present on my night out. ""It's a meticulous process that involves mapping the body almost like an architect maps a blueprint,"" Ochs says of the magical effect I'm describing. ""Most high-street versions replicate the look, but not the performance. Ours is engineered to move with you while still sculpting the silhouette in a clean, elevated way."" What to Consider Before Buying the Hervé Léger Bandage Dress I'd be remiss not to acknowledge the high price point of The Elise (and all Hervé Léger bandage dresses for that matter), but as described above, there's no denying the craftsmanship that distinguishes this bandage dress as higher caliber, so it's unsurprising that the retail price reflects this. That being said, I wish there was a wider size range and hope the brand has plans to expand in the future. According to Ochs, ""Inclusivity and wearability are absolutely central to our evolution. We embrace curves!"" So far, Hervé Léger has introduced additional length options, sleeves, styles, and fabrications, including lightweight rib knits and stretch suiting that ""offer more ease without sacrificing structure."" Ochs tells PS, ""Comfort and confidence aren't mutually exclusive; it's about giving women options that allow them to define sensuality on their own terms."" Where Is the Hervé Léger Bandage Dress Available?..."

Si bien la automotriz del Rombo reportó un aumento del 2.9% en sus ventas mundiales durante el primer trimestre del 2025 -y lo festejó con un documental en Amazon Prime llamado ""Anatomía de un Retorno""-, a nivel ejecutivo la empresa es un verdadero tembladeral: no deja de pasar un sólo día sin renuncias y cambios en la cúpula directiva. En Motor1 ya reportamos acerca de la seguidilla de renuncias protagonizadas en pocos días por el brasileño Luiz Fernando Pedrucci (CEO de Renault Latinoamérica) y Luca de Meo (CEO Global de Renault Group), ver nota. Esta semana siguieron los movimientos en la empresa. Tras 25 años en la compañía, ayer anunció su despedida el español Lucas Bellieud. Por estos días, Bellieud se desempeñaba como responsable de Renault Turquía, pero había trabajado varios años al frente de la división de importadores del Rombo en América Latina. Tanto Pedrucci como Bellieud no informaron a qué se dedicarán a partir de ahora ni se conocieron los nombres de los reemplantes en sus cargos. Es distinto el caso de Luca de Meo. Tras haber tenido que brindar explicaciones ante el Parlamento francés acerca de su salario de 5.5 millones de euros (y luego de que le negaran un aumento de sueldo), De Meo anunció su pase a la industria de los productos de moda y lujo. Asumirá al frente del Grupo Kering, donde comandará marcas de lujo como Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent y Balenciaga. Las noticias de renuncias continuaron esta tarde. En Brasil se despidió Ricardo Gondo: era el presidente de Renault Brasil y mano derecha de Pedrucci. La empresa le agradeció su ""profesionalismo, compromiso y contribución para el crecimiento de la marca Renault"" y le deseó ""éxito en su nueva etapa"". Sin embargo, ninguna de las partes informó en qué consistirá esta ""nueva etapa"". Lo que sí se supo es que el cargo de presidente de Renault Brasil será cubierto por un ingeniero argentino: el cordobés Ariel Montenegro. Es un egresado de la UTN con tan sólo 39 años, quien hasta hoy se desempeñaba como presidente de Renault Colombia. La movida fue sorpresiva, porque hasta hace unas horas Montenegro se encontraba al frente del lanzamiento de la tercera generación de la Duster en Bogotá (ver nota de ayer). Renault Brasil recibió al ejecutivo argentino con estas palabras. ""Ariel Montenegro reportará a Fabrice Cambolive, CEO de la marca Renault. Es un ingeniero mecánico argentino, egresado de la Universidad Tecnológica Nacional de Argentina, e inició su carrera en Renault Argentina como aprendiz en 2005. A lo largo de su carrera, ha ocupado diversos cargos en la región de las Américas y en Francia. En 2020, Ariel fue nombrado Director Ejecutivo y Jefe de Gabinete del CEO de la marca Renault, donde apoyó el desarrollo del plan estratégico de Renault. Trabajó en estrecha colaboración con el Comité Ejecutivo en la coordinación y dirección del Grupo Renault. En 2022, Ariel fue nombrado Presidente y CEO de Renault-SOFASA, la filial del Grupo en Colombia. En 2024, fue reconocido por la revista Forbes como uno de los 15 CEO más innovadores del país"". El próximo 9 de julio, Renault realizará en Brasil su lanzamiento más importante del año para América Latina: se presentá el nuevo Boreal, un modelo inédito de la marca del Rombo, que se fabricará en el país vecino para abastecer a toda la región y que se planea exportar a otros mercados. La gran duda ya no es cómo será el Boreal (ver fotos espía), sino quiénes serán los ejecutivos que estarán al frente de la compañía cuando llegue el momento de presentarlo en público. C.C.

(I'm not even kidding, this is serious now!) Our Kolhapuri chappals are now walking down Prada's runway. Khadi is a “luxury” fabric in Gucci's catalogue. Haldi doodh has been rebranded as “Turmeric Latte” for $8 a cup. We've built it since or maybe before Independence and now we buy it back, feeling proud? For decades, we've treated our own heritage like second-class citizens. Mocked it. Ignored it. Waited for the West to clap, before we even took it seriously. Now, when some influencer calls your dadi's dupatta a “Scandi scarf,” you wanna act surprised? We didn't just lose credit. We lost confidence. Makhana became a “superfood” only when Whole Foods Market put it on a shelf. Chai became “Chai Latte” the moment Starbucks added foam. Our spices. Our weaves. Our wisdom. All needing Western approval to feel worthy. Because we were too damn scared to call our own culture premium. Too obsessed with importing trends to realise we were the trend. I might sound rude, but India doesn't lack innovation. India lacks audacity. We keep exporting the gold and importing the packaging. So no, I'm not angry at the West for monetising our heritage. I'm angry at us for waiting this long to do it ourselves. Stop begging for validation. Start building legacy. #India #culture #global #trend #shame"

D616F7537CAF6150AFACB98604CAA6EB,2025-06-25 07:16:56,en,PRINT,"  After 28 days of testimony in the federal sex-trafficking and racketeering trial, both sides rested. The music mogul did not take the stand. Federal prosecutors and defense lawyers rested their cases at Sean Combs's sex-trafficking and racketeering conspiracy trial on Tuesday, and the music mogul announced that he would not be testifying in his own defense. After six weeks of letting his lawyers speak for him, Mr. Combs stood up at the defense table and addressed the court, out of the presence of jurors. Asked by the judge, Arun Subramanian, how he was doing, Mr. Combs said, ''I'm doing great, how are you, your honor?'' and quickly added, ''I wanted to tell you, thank you, you're doing an excellent job.'' Mr. Combs, wearing a brown sweater and a white collared shirt, told the judge he had discussed the issue ''thoroughly'' with his lawyers, and then confirmed that he had decided not to testify. ''That is solely my decision,'' Mr. Combs said, leaning in to speak into the microphone with his hands resting on the defense table. He clarified that the decision was made ''with my lawyers.'' Prosecutors have argued that Mr. Combs coerced two women into participating in drug-fueled sex marathons with male escorts that he directed, masturbated during and sometimes filmed. Over 28 days of testimony at Federal District Court in Lower Manhattan, government attorneys sought to establish a pattern of criminal activity by Mr. Combs and an inner circle of employees, walking the jury through allegations of kidnapping, arson, drug violations and forced labor. They called a slate of witnesses who observed firsthand the relationships between Mr. Combs and the women at the core of the sex-trafficking case: Casandra Ventura and a woman known by the pseudonym Jane. Mr. Combs has pleaded not guilty to the charges, and his lawyers have vehemently disputed the government's depiction of him as the leader of a criminal conspiracy responsible for crimes across two decades. They have argued that the women were willing participants in the sexual encounters during yearslong romantic relationships with him. Before the defense presented its case, it made an extensive legal argument for the court to enter an acquittal on the charges, a routine effort at this juncture of a trial. The judge said he would rule on that request at a later time. The defense then presented a brief case -- lasting about 25 minutes -- in which lawyers refreshed jurors's memories about testimony from weeks earlier and read aloud text exchanges between Ms. Ventura and Mr. Combs. ''We might drive each other crazy sometimes,'' Ms. Ventura texted Mr. Combs in 2017, ''but baby you really do make me happy.'' The bulk of the defense's case had already been made throughout the trial, during vigorous cross-examination of nearly all of the 34 witnesses called by the prosecution. Mr. Combs's team of lawyers grilled Ms. Ventura and Jane at length, seized on inconsistencies in the accounts of witnesses and elicited testimony in which former employees expressed continued admiration for Mr. Combs. Seated between his lawyers in the courtroom, Mr. Combs has been an active member of his own defense team, writing messages on sticky notes and appearing deeply engaged with the evidence. When his lawyers took over questioning from the government, he tended to become more animated, at times nodding emphatically -- a habit that once drew a rebuke from the judge after he did so while looking at the jury. The defense has focused on messages from the women in which they conveyed enthusiasm for the sex with escorts, known to Ms. Ventura as ''freak-offs'' and to Jane as ''hotel nights.'' On Tuesday, Teny Geragos, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, spent hours combing through Jane's messages as she cross-examined the final government witness, Joseph Cerciello, a federal agent who reviewed thousands of pages of records in the case. ''Tonight was amazing,'' Jane texted a man who had been flown in for a hotel night in 2023. '' Thank you for always bringing that good energy.'' During her testimony, Jane said that she participated in the hotel nights to please her partner, but over time, they made her feel manipulated and violated. She testified that she eventually decided to choose some of the men she had sex with in front of Mr. Combs to assert some control over her situation, and wrote them positive messages because she did not want them to be left feeling ''used.'' Much of the cross-examination of Mr. Cerciello consisted of a recitation of similar texts, many of them sexually explicit or sprinkled with emojis. In one exchange with Mr. Combs from later in 2023, Jane took the lead in arranging another night with the same escort, and Ms. Geragos described a collection of accompanying emojis she sent, including a ''smirk'' face, a ''kissy'' face, an eggplant and a ''tongue out'' face. ''Baby, all is set,'' she texted Mr. Combs about the plan, along with heart emojis. Jane's relationship with Mr. Combs lasted until his arrest in 2024. When Ms. Ventura sued him in November 2023, the couple briefly broke up amid tensions over the hotel nights. But they soon got back together and she resumed having sex with escorts. As scrutiny of Mr. Combs was building, the encounters took place at their homes instead of hotels, Jane testified. On Tuesday, the defense played several clips from a sexual encounter between Jane and an escort in summer 2024, which jurors watched on private screens and listened to on headphones. The video dates back to when the government was deep in its criminal investigation into Mr. Combs. He was arrested seven weeks later. In the final week of their case, prosecutors also focused on showing the role they say Mr. Combs's employees played in setting up hotel nights, presenting messages in which assistants discussed finding hotel rooms, dropping off supplies such as baby oil and lubricant, and ensuring the presence of a ''Gucci bag,'' which witnesses said was used to hold drugs. While arguing for her client's acquittal on Tuesday afternoon outside the presence of the jury, a lawyer for Mr. Combs, Alexandra Shapiro, said the government had failed to prove that those employees participated in a racketeering conspiracy responsible for sex trafficking Ms. Ventura and Jane. She said the employees were not aware of the specifics of what occurred in the hotel rooms, and that Mr. Combs at times took measures to hide the presence of escorts from them. ''The gist of the evidence here about these other employees is that they ran personal errands, they engaged in damage control for Mr. Combs,'' she said. Ms. Shapiro argued that although Mr. Combs was at times violent with Ms. Ventura, he had no reason to believe that either she or Jane were participating in the sex with escorts involuntarily. ''Domestic violence is not sex trafficking,'' Ms. Shapiro said. The prosecution's case has narrowed some during the trial. Another former girlfriend of Mr. Combs, who prosecutors had said would testify about sexual coercion, did not appear as a witness. Nor did another woman who was referred to in court as alleged ''Victim-5'' and whom the defense described as another girlfriend. Closing arguments are scheduled to begin Thursday.

mov_295FD513D481DF2CFCABBD465954ECB3,2025-06-25 07:51:27,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Dank der Romane von Agatha Christie avancierte Hercule Poirot zu einem der berühmtesten Detektive der Literatur- und Filmgeschichte – und zwar schon seit 1965. Bereits mehrfach hat es Hercule Poirot als Hauptfigur zahlreicher Kriminalgeschichten auf die Kinoleinwand und ins heimische TV-Programm geschafft. Einige Filme erfreuten sich dabei so großer Beliebtheit, dass sie über die Jahrzehnte sogar mehrfach verfilmt wurden – natürlich mit verschiedenen Schauspielern in der Hauptrolle. In Kenneth Branagh haben die aktuellen Hercule-Poirot-Filme einen ikonischen Darsteller gefunden, der mit „Mord im Orient-Express“, „Tod auf dem Nil“ und „A Haunting in Venice“ bereits dreimal in die Rolle des meisterhaften Detektivs schlüpfte und sogar selbst Regie führte. Ob es im Anschluss einen weiteren Hercule-Poirot-Film mit und von Branagh geben wird, ist noch nicht bekannt. Hercule Poirot: Kinofilme im Überblick Insgesamt sechs Geschichten über Hercule Poirot schafften es bisher auf die Kinoleinwand und wurden teilweise mehrfach adaptiert. Nach „Mord im Orient-Express“ und „Tod auf dem Nil“ haucht Kenneth Branagh mit „A Haunting in Venice“ einem weiteren Roman von Agatha Christie neues Leben ein, denn der Film basiert auf dem Werk „Die Halloween-Party“. Im Venedig der Nachkriegszeit nimmt Poirot am Halloween-Abend an einer Séance teil, bei der ein Gast ermordet wird. Jetzt ist es am Meisterdetektiv, die Wahrheit herauszufinden. Wer hatte es auf das Opfer abgesehen? Oder haben gar übernatürliche Mächte ihre Finger im Spiel? Das erfahrt ihr ab sofort auf Disney+, wo ihr den dritten Hercule-Poirot-Film aus der Feder von Michael Green sehen könnt. Vor der Kamera stehen unter anderem Stars wie Tina Fey („Only Murders in the Building“), Jamie Dornan („Fifty Shades Of Grey“), Michelle Yeoh („Everything Everywhere All At Once“), Kyle Allen („West Side Story“), Camille Cottin („House of Gucci“), Jude Hill („Belfast“), Ali Khan („The School for Good and Evil“), Emma Laird („The Crowded Room“), Kelly Reilly („Sherlock Holmes“) und Riccardo Scamarcio („John Wick: Kapitel 2“) sowie selbstverständlich Kenneth Branagh als Hercule Poirot. Mit „Tod auf dem Nil“ wird der gleichnamige Roman von 1937 adaptiert. Während der Flitterwochen kommt Lady Linnet Ridgeway nach einem Steinschlag nur knapp mit dem Leben davon. Hercule Poirot glaubt jedoch nicht an Zufälle und nimmt die Ermittlungen auf. Wer hätte ein Motiv, die frischvermählte Dame zu töten? Das versucht zunächst Sir Peter Ustinov mit seinem Debüt als Poirot herauszufinden, bis 2022 erneut Kenneth Branagh nach Beweisen sucht. Die Neuverfilmung von „Tod auf dem Nil“ soll als Fortsetzung der 2017er-Version von „Mord im Orient-Express“ dienen. Streamen könnt ihr den Film auf Disney+. Wer sich lieber am Ursprungsfilm erfreuen möchte, kann diesen bei Prime Video käuflich erwerben oder im Zusatz-Kanal Arthaus+ via Prime Video streamen. Bei einer Zugreise bittet Samuel Edward Ratchett den berüchtigten Detektiv Poirot um Hilfe, denn er bangt um sein Leben. Doch Poirot lehnt ab – eine Entscheidung, die prompt bestraft wird: Am nächsten Morgen wird Ratchett tot aufgefunden. Während der Zug versucht, den Schneesturm zu bewältigen, begibt sich Poirot auf Spurensuche. Agatha Christies Roman „Mord im Orient-Express“ stammt bereits aus dem Jahr 1934 und ist inspiriert von einem wahren Verbrechen. Die erste Film-Adaption von 1973 mit Albert Finney in der Hauptrolle des Hercule Poirot kam beim Publikum so gut an, dass sie 2017 nochmals für das Kino verfilmt wurde. Diesmal lieh Kenneth Branagh dem Detektiv sein Gesicht. In der Zwischenzeit adaptierte auch Regisseur Carl Schenkel die Geschichte (2001). Der Film mit Alfred Molina in der Hauptrolle wurde allerdings nur im TV ausgestrahlt. Ob Poirot den Fall lösen kann, erfahrt ihr entweder in der Neuverfilmung auf Disney+ und bei Prime Video oder in der 1974er-Version bei Arthaus+. In „Rendezvous mit einer Leiche“ schlüpft Sir Peter Ustinov ein drittes Mal in die Rolle von Hercule Poirot. Basierend auf dem Roman „Der Tod wartet“ von 1938 muss der Detektiv den tödlichen Erbschaftsstreit der Familie Boynton aufklären, obwohl er eigentlich nur eine Urlaubsreise nach Palästina plante. „Das Böse unter der Sonne“ adaptiert den gleichnamigen Roman von Agatha Christie aus dem Jahr 1941. In Sorge um seinen Diamanten zieht Sir Horace Blatt den berüchtigten Hercule Poirot (Sir Peter Ustinov) zurate. Doch der Detektiv bekommt es mit einem weitaus dramatischeren Rätsel zu tun: Nachdem er sich im Luxuschalet der Urlaubsinsel mit anderen Gästen bekannt gemacht hat, wird Arlena Marshalls Leiche geborgen. Statt eines Diamanten sucht Poirot nun nach dem Mörder. Mit ihrem 18. Kriminalroman „Die Morde des Herrn ABC“ aus dem Jahr 1936 feierte die britische Schriftstellerin Agatha Christie 1965 ihr Kinodebüt. Detektiv Hercule Poirot, damals gespielt von Tony Randall, vermutet ein besonderes Muster hinter einer Mordserie: Nachdem Albert Aachen und Betty Barnard einem Verbrechen zum Opfer fallen, fürchtet Poirot um das Leben von Sir Carmichael Clarke – denn die Opfer könnten alphabetisch ausgewählt werden. Hat Amanda Beatrice Cross womöglich ihre Finger im Spiel? Hercule Poirot im TV: Fernsehfilme über Agatha Christies Detektiv Hercule Poirot löste seine Fälle nicht nur in Christies Romanen und auf der Kinoleinwand, sondern auch im heimischen Wohnzimmer seiner Fans. Insgesamt drei Fernsehfilme mit Sir Peter Ustinov in der Hauptrolle sorgen für Spannung und Rätselfieber. Hercule Poirot begibt sich in die Welt der Schauspielerei und darf dabei seiner Rolle als Detektiv treu bleiben: Gleich drei Mordfälle buhlen um seine Aufmerksamkeit, die alle miteinander verbunden zu sein scheinen… Wieder bewegt sich Hercule Poirot in der Welt der Reichen und Schönen, als auf der Feier von Filmstar Charles Cartwright ein Gast zu Tode kommt. Prompt folgt die nächste Leiche. Handelt es sich um Zufall oder eiskalten Mord? Aus einem Spiel wird plötzlich Realität: Eine Krimi-Autorin bewegt Hercule Poirot dazu, einen inszenierten Mordfall aufzuklären. Doch die Frau, die eigentlich nur die Leiche spielen sollte, wird tatsächlich tot aufgefunden. Der Meisterdetektiv nimmt die Ermittlungen auf, während der Fall zu einer Mordserie mutiert.

mov_EF653D116166B725FB342FA7668C56EC,2025-06-25 10:21:01,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Carlos Martorell nació en Barcelona en diciembre de 1944 en el seno de una familia de la sociedad barcelonesa. Desde muy joven destacó por su personalidad muy especial, irrepetible, unas veces arrebatadora y otras difícil, pero encantadora como la de los genios. Si he conocido a una persona entregada a servir a los demás para que disfruten ése es Carlos, capaz de conseguir que lo más difícil parezca fácil. Antes de seguir, solicito humildemente un homenaje público del Govern balear, en el que sus amigos podamos darle las gracias por todo lo que nos ha hecho vivir y disfrutar sin pedir jamás nada a cambio. La carrera profesional que eligió Carlos se aleja bastante de la que a priori se esperaba de él. Estudió Derecho en la Universidad de Barcelona. Comenzó su carrera de relaciones públicas a los 18 años organizando los momentos recreativos de los congresos internacionales de medicina, siendo su padre presidente de la Sociedad Internacional de Cirugía Cardiovascular. Es colegiado fundador del Col·legi de Publicitaris i Relacions Públiques de Catalunya. Impartió clases en la Universitat Internacional de Catalunya. En Carlos nada ha sido un regalo, al contrario, todo ese mundo que nos hubiese gustado vivir fue la consecuencia de un esfuerzo sobrehumano que, como pasa siempre en España, pocos saben entender y valorar. Ya es hora de que les demos las gracias a los que nos han hecho la vida bonita. Los que no lo conocen fliparán cuando les hable de sus logros y hazañas. Empiecen a flipar como si estuviesen en una de esas fiestas alucinógenas que creó Carlos. En 1963 fue a conocer la isla de Ibiza, entonces virgen y pobre. Se enamoró y abandonó su carrera de Derecho, en el quinto curso, para instalarse a vivir en la Ibiza hippy, en 1968. Y habló tanto de Ibiza que ese año Oriol Regás, propietario de la discoteca Bocaccio de Barcelona, le encargó que organizase un viaje para que unos 110 clientes de la discoteca pasasen tres días divertidos en la aún desconocida Ibiza. Volaron en un avión alquilado de Spantax, ocuparon todo el Hotel Montesol y bailaron todas las noches en la muy pequeña discoteca Lola's, donde Carlos había organizado la Noche de Blanco. La expedición tuvo mucho éxito y fue la primera vez que la prensa española publicó titulares como «Fiesta en Ibiza». Inconscientemente había plantado la semilla del exitoso ocio nocturno. En 1969 le enseñó la isla a Ricardo Urgell, que decidió abrir el Pacha de Ibiza. Y Carlos le ayudó a organizar la fiesta de apertura. Y, desde entonces, Carlos no paró de colaborar con Pacha, llevando a bailar incluso a miembros de la realeza como los Reyes de Bulgaria, la Princesa María Gabriela de Saboya, el Conde de Barcelona, padre del Rey Juan Carlos, la Infanta Elena, miembros de la familia de Raniero de Mónaco y muchos famosos nacionales e internacionales. Más adelante organizó las aperturas de las discotecas Amnesia, Charly Max y KU (hoy Unvers). Para la apertura de Amnesia fue a Nueva York a comprar los discos de vinilo. Y su invitada principal fue la actriz Ursula Andress. Para la apertura de KU tuvo una idea premonitoria y ecológica. Organizó el Funeral por el Mediterráneo llenando con cientos de botellas de plástico la gran piscina. Y todos los invitados iban en procesión, alrededor de las aguas, con velones en las manos, vestidos de luto obligatorio, con el Réquiem de Mozart. Carlos habla cinco idiomas y ha sido modelo de publicidad para White Horse y Desigual. En 1971 compró un triplex en Dalt Vila, que filmé para mi programa House & Style. Y alquiló una casa sin electricidad, en Sant Carles, donde pasó 35 mágicos veranos. En 1972 viajó a Nueva York y, desde entonces, pasó 17 otoños seguidos en la gran ciudad. Allí trabajó como periodista fotografiando y entrevistando a personajes muy famosos como Andy Warhol, Mick Jagger, Grace Jones, Halston, Elsa Peretti, Paloma Picasso y Liza Minelli, entre otros. Hace periodismo y colabora con el Diario de Ibiza, el Periódico de Ibiza y la revista Ibiza Live Report. Y desde hace cinco años cuenta todos los jueves las Historias de Carlos Martorell en Onda Cero Ibiza y Formentera. Durante un tiempo trabajó para la introducción del arquitecto Ricardo Bofill en París. Y es asesor de prensa del arquitecto José Ribas. Hay relaciones públicas modernos e influencers que no saben quién es esta leyenda viva que inventó una forma de trabajar para ellos. Javier Escobar y otros aprendieron mucho de su maestro. Carlos reclama su lugar en este mundo donde cabezas infantiles ganan fortunas. Ha escrito dos novelas Réquiem por Peter Pan en Ibiza (traducida en inglés en digital) y La memoria enjaulada, sobre el Alzheimer. Ambas en venta en Amazon. Y publicó el libro El Baile de Pacha, que es una joya, con Toni Riera. El Consulting de Carlos Martorell se ha ocupado de la organización de eventos, promoción y divulgación de marcas. Y entre sus clientes están Dior, Loewe, Armani, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Calvin Klein, Etro, Chopard, relojes Chanel, Polo Ralph Lauren, Mango, Swatch, Cartier, Tiffany, Rabat, Virgin Galactic, Charlotte Tilbury y Bru&Bru. Otra de sus especialidades es la promoción de restaurantes y hoteles, como el Montesol, Ibiza Gran Hotel, Standard Hotel y el agroturismo Atzaró, donde colaboró para las fiestas de Mango de Penélope Cruz y su hermana Mónica, y del perfume Lady Rebel. Además, ha hecho varias exposiciones de sus fotos de la India y Haití. Y ha decorado restaurantes y varias casas particulares. Su gusto estético, en cualquier ámbito, es fabuloso. Una clase auténtica sin coches de lujo ni brillantes en las orejas...."

Si bien la automotriz del Rombo reportó un aumento del 2.9% en sus ventas mundiales durante el primer trimestre del 2025 -y lo festejó con un documental en Amazon Prime llamado ""Anatomía de un Retorno ""-, a nivel ejecutivo la empresa es un verdadero tembladeral: no deja de pasar un sólo día sin renuncias y cambios en la cúpula directiva. En Motor1 ya reportamos acerca de la seguidilla de renuncias protagonizadas en pocos días por el brasileño Luiz Fernando Pedrucci (CEO de Renault Latinoamérica) y Luca de Meo (CEO Global de Renault Group), ver nota. Esta semana siguieron los movimientos en la empresa. Tras 25 años en la compañía, ayer anunció su despedida el español Lucas Bellieud. Por estos días, Bellieud se desempeñaba como responsable de Renault Turquía, pero había trabajado varios años al frente de la división de importadores del Rombo en América Latina. Tanto Pedrucci como Bellieud no informaron a qué se dedicarán a partir de ahora ni se conocieron los nombres de los reemplantes en sus cargos. Es distinto el caso de Luca de Meo. Tras haber tenido que brindar explicaciones ante el Parlamento francés acerca de su salario de 5.5 millones de euros (y luego de que le negaran un aumento de sueldo), De Meo anunció su pase a la industria de los productos de moda y lujo. Asumirá al frente del Grupo Kering, donde comandará marcas de lujo como Gucci, Yves Saint Laurent y Balenciaga. Las noticias de renuncias continuaron esta tarde. En Brasil se despidió Ricardo Gondo: era el presidente de Renault Brasil y mano derecha de Pedrucci. La empresa le agradeció su ""profesionalismo, compromiso y contribución para el crecimiento de la marca Renault "" y le deseó ""éxito en su nueva etapa "". Sin embargo, ninguna de las partes informó en qué consistirá esta ""nueva etapa Lo que sí se supo es que el cargo de presidente de Renault Brasil será cubierto por un ingeniero argentino: el cordobés Ariel Montenegro. Es un egresado de la UTN con tan sólo 39 años, quien hasta hoy se desempeñaba como presidente de Renault Colombia. La movida fue sorpresiva, porque hasta hace unas horas Montenegro se encontraba al frente del lanzamiento de la tercera generación de la Duster en Bogotá (ver nota de ayer). Renault Brasil recibió al ejecutivo argentino con estas palabras. ""Ariel Montenegro reportará a Fabrice Cambolive, CEO de la marca Renault. Es un ingeniero mecánico argentino, egresado de la Universidad Tecnológica Nacional de Argentina, e inició su carrera en Renault Argentina como aprendiz en 2005. A lo largo de su carrera, ha ocupado diversos cargos en la región de las Américas y en Francia. En 2020, Ariel fue nombrado Director Ejecutivo y Jefe de Gabinete del CEO de la marca Renault, donde apoyó el desarrollo del plan estratégico de Renault. Trabajó en estrecha colaboración con el Comité Ejecutivo en la coordinación y dirección del Grupo Renault. En 2022, Ariel fue nombrado Presidente y CEO de Renault-SOFASA, la filial del Grupo en Colombia. En 2024, fue reconocido por la revista Forbes como uno de los 15 CEO más innovadores del país El próximo 9 de julio, Renault realizará en Brasil su lanzamiento más importante del año para América Latina: se presentá el nuevo Boreal, un modelo inédito de la marca del Rombo, que se fabricará en el país vecino para abastecer a toda la región y que se planea exportar a otros mercados. La gran duda ya no es cómo será el Boreal (ver fotos espía), sino quiénes serán los ejecutivos que estarán al frente de la compañía cuando llegue el momento de presentarlo en público. C.C.

3. 港科大（HKUST）：全球第44位（商科+人工智能顶尖）
4. 港城大（CityU）：全球第53位（传媒/计算机强校）

7. 岭南大学（Lingnan）：701-710组别（博雅教育特色）
8. 教大（EdUHK）：首次上榜第530位（教育学香港第[种草R]一）
📢 学生反馈：
“港大资源爆炸！ 教授全是行业大牛，但课业压力超大，凌晨图书馆常驻选手在此”
“PolyU设计系实习直接对接LV、Gucci，毕业offer拿到手软”
💡【港校三大核心优势】
[彩虹R]科研转化强
港校获国家政策支持，实验室资金充足（如港大东校区联手谷歌），工科生专利转化收入高。 [彩虹R]留港就业便利
硕士毕业即获2年IANG签证，7年拿永居；港府PSW签证放宽，2025毕业生起薪达£36,500（约¥33万）
[彩虹R]国际化跳板
全英文授课，超50%教授来自牛剑/常春藤；交换项目覆盖全球TOP100院校。 📢 学生吐槽：
“别被'水硕'骗了！ 港科大数据科学每天coding到秃头，但亚马逊校招直接发offer真香”
“岭南大学小众但师生比1：10，教授记得每个人名字，适合社恐人”
🚨【2026申请真相：偏好+雷区】
✅ 录取偏好的变化
商科：港大/港中文偏爱海本+高GMAT（建议700+），但双非可冲 港理工/浸会（均分85++）
理工科：爆火赛道！ 港科大AI、港城大金融科技 新增校企合作专业，重视核心课程匹配度
文社科：港中文教育学接受跨申，但需提交教学实践报告（支教/实习证明加分）
❌ 避坑指南
语言陷阱：部分中文授课专业（如都会大学MBA）无英语成绩要求，但回国认证可能受限
名单预警：
港大/港中文商学院卡陆本985/211名单，双非慎选！ 港理工设计学院2026或提门槛，作品集尽早准备
费用刺客：商科学费涨至57万港币/年（港大金融），租房建议选深水埗村屋省30%预算
💬【小欧一句话建议】
“选校看专业＞看排名！ 港城大传媒资源碾压部分前50院校”
“想留港工作优先选'亲企业'校：港大/港理工雇主认可度最高”
“文书别堆简历！ 港校爱讲故事

And for Summer, it's flying solo with this season's trending #flipflops and bandana #headscarf I've always chosen my garments wisely for a number of reasons. I like the endless styling options of having a tight, though extensive wardrobe. I'm acutely aware of each and every piece so when I'm out in the world and see something I like I can make a quick assessment of my wardrobe and know if it will fit in. For me excessive buying feels aimless and in a way it displays a lack of creativity. When we can style and restyle our garments in new fresh ways, it's like a gift that keeps on giving. My Summer look is simple and effortless. I've included a turquoise bangle that works with the smallest of my stacked necklaces to add a nice  colour punch. And my big straw bag is like a visual confirmation that Summer is really here. pro-tip: whatever you choose to include in your wardrobe should be worthy of its place among your other garments and the space in your closet. *please treat your wardrobe well. many people work very hard to get it to you.

The collaboration will see Cirque du Soleil headline the upcoming Alpha Season 6 in The Sandbox, transporting players into imaginative worlds inspired by its theatrical legacy. Cirque du Soleil will headline the upcoming Alpha Season 6 in The Sandbox, transporting players into imaginative worlds inspired by its theatrical legacy. Share As part of this collaboration, players will step into interactive games, known as “Experiences,” based on two of Cirque du Soleil's celebrated shows, Luzia and a second show yet to be revealed. Reflecting the grandeur, vibrancy, and emotion of a live Cirque performance, these experiences will blend narrative and spectacle in ways only possible through The Sandbox's unique metaverse gameplay. The collaboration will also introduce a series of limited-edition themed digital collectibles and avatars that can be used in-game throughout The Sandbox. “We've explored digital storytelling before, but this collaboration with The Sandbox opens up new creative avenues,” said Noah Lemieux Bernier, Vice President, Digital and Customer Experience, Cirque du Soleil. “It enables us to bring the awe and artistry of our performances into immersive virtual spaces, fostering emotional connections with both longtime fans and new audiences in a format that's interactive, social, and playful. It's all part of our ambition to bring Cirque du Soleil into fans' lives from showtime to all the time, with customer experience at the core.” In addition to the experiences, The Sandbox will be releasing Cirque du Soleil-branded assets for its creator community to utilize in building their own user-generated content, unlocking new creative possibilities for experiences designed by end-users inspired by the artistry and energy of Cirque. “Cirque du Soleil has constantly redefined live entertainment through imagination and emotion, and we're thrilled to welcome them into The Sandbox to bring that spirit into the metaverse,” said Arthur Madrid, CEO and Co-Founder of The Sandbox. “This collaboration allows us to explore new forms of immersive storytelling to deliver the thrill of live spectacle in an interactive format, true to the energy of a theater experience.” Both companies shared more details about the collaboration this week in New York during a keynote session at NFT.NYC, alongside unveiling a series of immersive real-world and digital experiences that celebrated the spirit of this groundbreaking collaboration. Highlights included a preview of Cirque's metaverse debut and a live short performance, with additional experiences and updates announced during the event and set to roll out in the coming weeks.

After all, London hardly resembles a battleground. That attitude, even so, is both obsolete and risky. Private protection has changed from luxury to practical, even vital, for an increasing quantity of citizens-not since the streets have got turned dangerous overnight, but because low key threats for instance aimed robbery, obsessive harassment, and creeping following have increased within quiet yet important ways. The Calm Surge in Threats Although London continues to be one of the particular worlds most photographed cities, a growing number of guests now ignore typically the warning signs blinking behind its shiny skyline.

    对新一代在数字世界中成长的年轻消费者来说，科技并不神秘，认同才是门槛 
  作者 | Jeanine Zhao 
  编辑 | Drizzie 
今年或将成为时尚智能眼镜的元年。 美国科技巨头谷歌宣布近日将与韩国时尚眼镜品牌Gentle Monster签署协议，向Gentle Monster注资1亿美元，联手开发首款扩展现实XR（Extended Reality）智能眼镜，引发行业广泛关注。 值得关注的是，LVMH集团旗下的私募基金公司L Catterton Asia 2017年收购了Gentle Monster部分股权，成为其第二大股东‌‌。 据消息人士透露，双方谈判已进入最后阶段，谷歌此次投资是在Gentle Monster估值3.6万亿韩元的基础上进行，这一估值是其2020年初次跻身独角兽行列时的三倍，通过该交易，谷歌将获得Gentle Monster 4%的股份。 双方合作打造的XR眼镜计划于明年正式亮相，具备AI驱动的实时导航、即时翻译和与智能助手互动等功能。 这也标志着谷歌在时隔十二年重返智能眼镜市场，并重金引Z世代间炙手可热的眼镜品牌Gentle Monster入局，彰显出谷歌想要打造一款超越科技产品范畴的时尚单品的野心。 实际上，进入2025年以来，谷歌已密集与三大不同定位的眼镜品牌达成合作布局。 今年5月，谷歌与Gucci母公司开云集团旗下的Kering Eyewear公布合作计划，双方将结合高端眼镜制造与Android XR技术，开发面向高端时尚消费人群的智能眼镜产品。 几乎同期，谷歌还与美国平价光学眼镜品牌Warby Parker宣布将联合推出具备AI能力的日常佩戴型智能眼镜，提供处方和非处方镜片选择，通过更加亲民的定价策略，覆盖更广泛的主流市场。 尽管上述合作尚未有产品面世，但加之与Gentle Monster的合作，谷歌的三条战线逐渐明了，共同指向其正试图通过差异化合作打造一个横跨奢侈、高街与潮流时尚的智能眼镜生态圈，在十二年的卧薪尝胆后，谷歌向Meta与雷朋合作开发的智能眼镜正式发起挑战。 早在2013年，谷歌曾推出第一代智能眼镜Google Glass。 这款产品搭载微型显示屏、骨传导扬声器、摄像头、语音控制系统，用户可通过眼前的微屏接收通知、拍照、导航甚至视频通话，被谷歌寄予厚望。 为了在产品发布前就打开消费市场，在2012年的纽约时装周上，比利时设计师Diane von Furstenberg将Google Glass带上了秀场，并与品牌时任创意总监Yvan Mispelaere、谷歌联合创始人Sergey Brin戴着Google Glass一同谢幕。 美版《Vogue》更是在9月刊中为这款眼镜推出长达12页的时尚大片，试图让科技单品进入主流生活方式叙事。 谷歌联合创始人Sergey Brin、Diane von Furstenberg、与DVF时任创意总监Yvan Mispelaere 
然而这场声势浩大的科技与时尚的跨圈联合并未扭转Google Glass的命运，该产品在推向市场后迅速遇冷。 由于产品设计突兀、定价过高、应用生态不成熟，电池续航短，以及隐私争议等问题，Google Glass始终无法走出极客和早期体验者的圈层。 最终，在2015年谷歌宣布停止消费版Glass的销售，并将其转型为企业级产品Glass Enterprise Edition，应用于医疗、制造等专业场景。 此后的十多年间，亚马逊、微软、Snap等科技公司陆续尝试智能眼镜产品。 社交媒体应用公司Snap在2016年推出Spectacles，用户可以拍摄短视频并直接分享到Snapchat，强调娱乐与创作者生态，而亚马逊在2019年推出Echo Frames，主打与Alexa的智能语音交互。 但无论是娱乐化路线还是功能导向，这些产品多停留在小众尝鲜阶段，始终未能打动大众市场。 这实际反映出智能眼镜面临的三重结构性挑战——技术形态未成熟、真实使用场景模糊，以及大众用户的接受门槛高企。 过去，制约智能眼镜普及的核心障碍在于产品在功能与佩戴舒适度之间难以取得平衡。 但近年来随着芯片制造和系统封装工艺的进步，智能眼镜已经可以在纤薄镜框中嵌入摄像头、扬声器、电池、传感器与计算单元，且续航能力已较初代模型有显著提升。 雷朋与Meta合作的第二代智能眼镜已能在与普通太阳镜相似的外观下，支持高清摄像、开环音频播放和AI视觉识别，显著提升了使用体验。 其次，生成式AI的突破性发展，极大拓展了智能眼镜的功能边界。 过去的语音助手更像命令执行器，而自2022年底生成式AI大爆发以来，AI已经能够更自然地理解复杂语言，并提供高度个性化、情境化的回应。 这也为智能眼镜推进实时翻译、导航建议、地标讲解等提供了可能。 与此同时，随着AI技术算力和模型能力的提升，多模态交互技术也在近年来被大规模应用于搜索、客服、内容创作乃至无障碍沟通等场景，AI系统可以同时理解和回应多种类型的输入信息，例如文字、图像、声音和视频。 在智能眼镜中，多模态交互的落地表现为更感知化的使用体验，例如，借助内建摄像头和手势识别等，用户甚至无需说话或点击，眼镜就能理解用户意图并作出反馈。 在使用场景方面，智能眼镜面临着培养用户粘性的挑战。 与智能手表不同，手表天生具备时间管理这一明确的日常功能，在加入健康监测、支付和通讯等新功能后，仍能紧贴用户原有的佩戴习惯。 而智能眼镜面临的尴尬处境是，消费者尚未习惯每天佩戴科技型眼镜，当产品功能未能提供强烈的日常刚需支撑时，使用动机便显得格外薄弱。 没有清晰的使用场景，就难以激发高频使用，而没有高频使用，就难以形成真正的消费习惯与产品价值感。 现实中真正能推动智能眼镜普及的，是那些无需刻意学习、融入日常自然流程的场景，例如导航时无需掏出手机查看路线，通勤途中用眼镜获取实时语音摘要，旅游中通过AI识别景点信息、翻译路牌或菜单等。 因此，近年来智能眼镜头部玩家开始逐渐从功能定义转向场景定义。 这就不得不提到当前市场上最成功的产品，即Meta与雷朋合作推出的第二代智能眼镜。 这款看似普通的雷朋太阳镜，在2023年推出后却意外成为爆款。 没有AR显示，也不靠科幻外观取胜，它主打拍照、录像、听音乐、打电话以及搭载AI的视觉识别能力，功能虽然有限，但在用户的真实生活场景中几乎为零学习成本。 2024年，雷朋Meta智能眼镜销量超过100万副，在2025年初，全球累计销量已突破200万副，市场占有率超过60%。 市场研究机构甚至指出，光是该产品就带动了2024年全球智能眼镜市场同比增长210%，为整个行业带来了希望。 品牌营销专家Michael Miraflor便是用户之一，他形容这款眼镜更像是升级版的AirPods，他在户外活动、参加社交聚会甚至日常打电话时都常佩戴，并强调一点：“我愿意戴它，是因为它根本不像智能设备，它像一副我原本就会戴的雷朋眼镜。” 这正是雷朋Meta的突破之处，它不是让用户适应科技，而是让科技顺势融入生活方式。 而这一切的背后，离不开雷朋母公司眼镜巨头陆逊梯卡集团的全盘布局。 这个全球最大的光学集团，正主动跳出传统角色，走向潮流文化的前线。 过去一年里动作频频，包括从VF集团手中收购曾经教父级的街头潮流品牌Supreme，于今年2月任命A$AP Rocky为雷朋史上首位品牌创意总监，在前几天又宣布与Travis Scott达成合作，让他担任集团旗下运动品牌Oakley的首位品牌愿景官，与Cactus Jack团队共同定义品牌的未来风格与表达。 借助潮流人物与文化叙事的双重加持，该集团集团正在将眼镜从一个功能性配件，转化为下一代年轻人生活方式的标志。 延续雷朋的热度，Meta也在今年与Oakley 推出新款智能眼镜，强化拍摄、防水与续航性能，专为骑行、滑雪、水上运动等高动感场景设计，精准切入那些已有但尚未被科技深度服务的使用缺口。 Meta与Oakley合作推出的高性能人工智能眼镜 
回看谷歌在在今年与Kering Eyewear、Warby Parker和Gentle Monster的三项合作，不难看出谷歌瞄准的场景需求揽括了奢侈品牌聚焦国际旅行和社交场合、高街品牌主攻日常通勤与功能性、潮流品牌则渗透年轻人的娱乐与互动需求，通过实际合作测试更有效的场景链接。 智能眼镜能否真正走入大众视野，还必须穿越一个最隐蔽却最根本的门槛——用户接受度。 这不仅是对产品功能的判断，更关乎个人审美、社交习惯与文化心理的深层认同。..."

 大型零售商业地产：重构城市消费版图的“空间革命” 
 引言：从“购物场所”到“城市客厅”的进化论 
在电商渗透率突破30%、体验经济规模年均增长15%的当下，全球大型零售商业地产正经历一场颠覆性变革。 2024年全球市场规模达3.2万亿美元，预计2030年将突破4.5万亿美元，年复合增长率（CAGR）达5.8%。 这一增长背后，是商业地产从“交易容器”向“体验枢纽”的转型——曼谷ICONSIAM通过湄南河景观与艺术策展结合，使客单价提升40%；上海前滩太古里以“双层开放街区+屋顶运动场”模式，实现日均客流12万人次，坪效达传统商场的2.3倍。 一、全球市场增长引擎：消费升级与科技赋能的双重奏

全球主要城市进入“存量更新”阶段，纽约、伦敦、东京等城市要求商业地产改造项目节能标准提升30%。 中国“十四五”规划明确提出“实施城市更新行动”，推动老旧商业体改造市场规模突破5000亿元。 北京SKP-S通过“未来农场”艺术装置与火星主题空间，使老旧百货坪效从0.8万元/㎡提升至6.2万元/㎡。 二、全球市场参与者格局：生态构建与模式创新 
 2.1 国际巨头的“全链整合”战略 
美国西蒙地产集团：全球最大REITs，管理资产超1200亿美元，通过“购物中心+奥特莱斯+混合用途”组合，出租率稳定在95%以上。 法国Unibail-Rodamco-Westfield：欧洲商业地产龙头，在悉尼、伦敦等地打造“超级城市综合体”，集成办公、酒店、公寓等业态，2024年租金收入增长8%。 日本三井不动产：依托“啦啦宝都”品牌，以“动漫IP+科技体验”吸引Z世代，2024年东京台场店销售额突破300亿日元。 2.2 中国企业的“场景革命”突围 
华润万象生活：中国最大商业运营服务商，在管项目102个，2024年零售额达1812亿元，同比增长43.3%。 其“万象城”系列通过“高端零售+艺术策展”模式，会员复购率超60%。 大悦城控股：聚焦“年轻力”市场，北京朝阳大悦城引入“度刻”书店、“teamLab无界美术馆”等IP，使18-35岁客群占比达75%。 凯德集团：新加坡资本背景，在中国运营26个购物中心，通过“来福士”品牌打造“垂直城市”，2024年数字化收入占比提升至25%。 2.3 科技公司的“跨界颠覆” 
亚马逊：推出Amazon Style实体店，通过RFID技术实现“即拿即走”购物，坪效较传统服装店提升3倍。 阿里巴巴：杭州亲橙里项目集成“刷脸支付”“AR导航”“智能停车”等技术，使消费者决策时间缩短40%。 特斯拉：在超级充电站嵌入“体验中心”，通过车辆展示与试驾活动，带动周边商业客流增长30%。 三、区域市场特征与发展趋势 
 3.1 北美市场：社区化与可持续性并重 
美国市场偏好“社区型购物中心”，2024年区域型商业体销售额占比达65%。 加拿大温哥华Oakridge Centre改造项目，通过“绿色屋顶+社区农场”设计，使碳排放降低50%，2025年将引入无人驾驶接驳车。 3.2 欧洲市场：文化融合与城市更新 
伦敦Westfield Stratford City通过“奥运遗产+文化地标”定位，年客流量超5000万人次。 巴黎Les Halles改造项目集成地下交通枢纽与公共广场，使周边商业价值提升40%。 3.3 亚太市场：体验经济与数字化领先 
中国：2024年市场规模达1.2万亿美元，CAGR 7.2%，“首店经济”推动差异化竞争，上海、北京首店数量占全国60%。 东南亚：印尼Jakarta Landmark 81 Tower购物中心引入“电竞馆+直播基地”，吸引年轻客群，2024年销售额增长65%。 印度：孟买Phoenix Mills通过“高端零售+美食广场”组合，使租金回报率达12%，2025年计划新增5个项目。 3.4 中东及非洲：奢华定位与旅游驱动 
迪拜The Dubai Mall年客流量超8000万人次，通过“水族馆+滑雪场”吸引全球游客。 南非Menlyn Maine购物中心集成赌场、酒店、办公，使区域商业价值提升3倍。 四、未来展望：机遇与挑战并存 
 4.1 可持续发展的“绿色革命” 
零碳建筑：全球LEED认证商业项目超1.2万个，预计2030年新增项目100%采用绿色标准。 循环经济：瑞典Emporia购物中心通过“二手市集+共享办公”模式，减少废弃物40%。 生物多样性：新加坡星耀樟宜种植超2000种植物，成为城市生态节点。 4.2 发展机遇：技术融合与场景延伸 
元宇宙商业：2025年全球虚拟购物中心市场规模预计达200亿美元，Gucci、Nike等品牌已开设数字旗舰店。 健康空间：后疫情时代，具备空气净化、无接触服务的商业体溢价达20%。 交通枢纽融合：东京涩谷站城一体化项目，通过“商业+交通+办公”组合，使区域GDP提升30%。 4.3 挑战与应对：消费分化与运营压力 
消费分层：全球奢侈品市场与折扣零售增速差达15个百分点，需精准定位客群。 成本上升：能源价格上涨使运营成本增加18%，需通过智能系统优化能耗。 竞争加剧：中国2024年新开购物中心超500个，空置率上升至12%，需强化差异化运营。 结语：以“空间革命”重塑城市商业文明 
大型零售商业地产市场的爆发，本质上是全球消费文明向“体验化、可持续化、数字化”转型的缩影。 从社区商业的温情到城市地标的震撼，从绿色科技的实践到元宇宙的探索，这一赛道正以5.8%的年增速重塑全球商业版图。 对于企业而言，唯有构建“场景创新-技术赋能-生态协同”的铁三角，方能在红海中开辟蓝海。 未来，商业地产或将超越“物理空间”的范畴，成为连接城市、人与未来的“超级接口”，开启“商业即服务”的新纪元。"

I think it was a payoff for his brother debts. everything that he did they did at least 3 1/2 years in office was not done by the president that was elected and it needs to be erased all of it voided any law any executive order anything that was done anything he signed needs to be validated, this is the biggest piece of fraud in the history of America. We cannot let this go down in history as being part of the presidency. It's bad enough all the Democratic Party are nothing but foreign agents and terrorist. They only care about illegal aliens not the American citizens because it's a head count it's a vote for them. Why did they give 3.5 million Social Security cards and numbers to illegal aliens somebody working in that office helped them second Salah nothing was verified no paperwork no nothing they just issued them which made them legal to vote. Why was this a line? It needs to be voided and removed oh my taxpayers money, paying for their free food their housing their childcare, free drivers license free what else? What else do they get free? I don't qualify for anything. I'm on Social Security. I'm on Social Security and I can't make it month to month and I don't qualify for any type of government assistance. My husband died in 2019. I live off of mine because I was the breadwinner. I get nothing but the illegal aliens get my taxpayers money, free, free, free free it's gotta stop someone needs to help us also it's all over the Internet and videos these women. Black and white spell the Gucci life they have eight children eight different fathers they collect eight different child support checks. They get food stamps for eight children section 8 housing childcare cash for eight children free phones, free Internet, free heat, discounted electric, free medical for eight children. Do this on purpose so they don't ever have to work and if they work, they take it under the table is cash. They all have their nails done their hair done their eyelashes done. This is child abuse. This needs to stop they've learned a way to beat the system again and live off the government. It's got to stop and I'm sure every last one of them have a male living with them. Should've never let them have eight kids should've stopped them at two should've tied their tubes. Reviews of the public system has to stop I'm Legal my families been in the in the state since the 1400s I get nothing I can't donate to this cause cause I don't have anything to donate so I'm writing this here.

对新一代在数字世界中成长的年轻消费者来说，科技并不神秘，认同才是门槛
作者 | Jeanine Zhao 编辑 | Drizzie
今年或将成为时尚智能眼镜的元年。 美国科技巨头谷歌宣布近日将与韩国时尚眼镜品牌Gentle Monster签署协议，向Gentle Monster注资1亿美元，联手开发首款扩展现实XR（Extended Reality）智能眼镜，引发行业广泛关注。 值得关注的是，LVMH集团旗下的私募基金公司L Catterton Asia 2017年收购了Gentle Monster部分股权，成为其第二大股东‌‌。 据消息人士透露，双方谈判已进入最后阶段，谷歌此次投资是在Gentle Monster估值3.6万亿韩元的基础上进行，这一估值是其2020年初次跻身独角兽行列时的三倍，通过该交易，谷歌将获得Gentle Monster 4%的股份。 双方合作打造的XR眼镜计划于明年正式亮相，具备AI驱动的实时导航、即时翻译和与智能助手互动等功能。 这也标志着谷歌在时隔十二年重返智能眼镜市场，并重金引Z世代间炙手可热的眼镜品牌Gentle Monster入局，彰显出谷歌想要打造一款超越科技产品范畴的时尚单品的野心。 实际上，进入2025年以来，谷歌已密集与三大不同定位的眼镜品牌达成合作布局。 今年5月，谷歌与Gucci母公司开云集团旗下的Kering Eyewear公布合作计划，双方将结合高端眼镜制造与Android XR技术，开发面向高端时尚消费人群的智能眼镜产品。 几乎同期，谷歌还与美国平价光学眼镜品牌Warby Parker宣布将联合推出具备AI能力的日常佩戴型智能眼镜，提供处方和非处方镜片选择，通过更加亲民的定价策略，覆盖更广泛的主流市场。 尽管上述合作尚未有产品面世，但加之与Gentle Monster的合作，谷歌的三条战线逐渐明了，共同指向其正试图通过差异化合作打造一个横跨奢侈、高街与潮流时尚的智能眼镜生态圈，在十二年的卧薪尝胆后，谷歌向Meta与雷朋合作开发的智能眼镜正式发起挑战。 早在2013年，谷歌曾推出第一代智能眼镜Google Glass。 这款产品搭载微型显示屏、骨传导扬声器、摄像头、语音控制系统，用户可通过眼前的微屏接收通知、拍照、导航甚至视频通话，被谷歌寄予厚望。 为了在产品发布前就打开消费市场，在2012年的纽约时装周上，比利时设计师Diane von Furstenberg将Google Glass带上了秀场，并与品牌时任创意总监Yvan Mispelaere、谷歌联合创始人Sergey Brin戴着Google Glass一同谢幕。 美版《Vogue》更是在9月刊中为这款眼镜推出长达12页的时尚大片，试图让科技单品进入主流生活方式叙事。 谷歌联合创始人Sergey Brin、Diane von Furstenberg、与DVF时任创意总监Yvan Mispelaere
然而这场声势浩大的科技与时尚的跨圈联合并未扭转Google Glass的命运，该产品在推向市场后迅速遇冷。 由于产品设计突兀、定价过高、应用生态不成熟，电池续航短，以及隐私争议等问题，Google Glass始终无法走出极客和早期体验者的圈层。 最终，在2015年谷歌宣布停止消费版Glass的销售，并将其转型为企业级产品Glass Enterprise Edition，应用于医疗、制造等专业场景。 此后的十多年间，亚马逊、微软、Snap等科技公司陆续尝试智能眼镜产品。 社交媒体应用公司Snap在2016年推出Spectacles，用户可以拍摄短视频并直接分享到Snapchat，强调娱乐与创作者生态，而亚马逊在2019年推出Echo Frames，主打与Alexa的智能语音交互。 但无论是娱乐化路线还是功能导向，这些产品多停留在小众尝鲜阶段，始终未能打动大众市场。 这实际反映出智能眼镜面临的三重结构性挑战——技术形态未成熟、真实使用场景模糊，以及大众用户的接受门槛高企。 过去，制约智能眼镜普及的核心障碍在于产品在功能与佩戴舒适度之间难以取得平衡。 但近年来随着芯片制造和系统封装工艺的进步，智能眼镜已经可以在纤薄镜框中嵌入摄像头、扬声器、电池、传感器与计算单元，且续航能力已较初代模型有显著提升。 雷朋与Meta合作的第二代智能眼镜已能在与普通太阳镜相似的外观下，支持高清摄像、开环音频播放和AI视觉识别，显著提升了使用体验。 其次，生成式AI的突破性发展，极大拓展了智能眼镜的功能边界。 过去的语音助手更像命令执行器，而自2022年底生成式AI大爆发以来，AI已经能够更自然地理解复杂语言，并提供高度个性化、情境化的回应。 这也为智能眼镜推进实时翻译、导航建议、地标讲解等提供了可能。 与此同时，随着AI技术算力和模型能力的提升，多模态交互技术也在近年来被大规模应用于搜索、客服、内容创作乃至无障碍沟通等场景，AI系统可以同时理解和回应多种类型的输入信息，例如文字、图像、声音和视频。 在智能眼镜中，多模态交互的落地表现为更感知化的使用体验，例如，借助内建摄像头和手势识别等，用户甚至无需说话或点击，眼镜就能理解用户意图并作出反馈。 在使用场景方面，智能眼镜面临着培养用户粘性的挑战。 与智能手表不同，手表天生具备时间管理这一明确的日常功能，在加入健康监测、支付和通讯等新功能后，仍能紧贴用户原有的佩戴习惯。 而智能眼镜面临的尴尬处境是，消费者尚未习惯每天佩戴科技型眼镜，当产品功能未能提供强烈的日常刚需支撑时，使用动机便显得格外薄弱。 没有清晰的使用场景，就难以激发高频使用，而没有高频使用，就难以形成真正的消费习惯与产品价值感。 现实中真正能推动智能眼镜普及的，是那些无需刻意学习、融入日常自然流程的场景，例如导航时无需掏出手机查看路线，通勤途中用眼镜获取实时语音摘要，旅游中通过AI识别景点信息、翻译路牌或菜单等。 因此，近年来智能眼镜头部玩家开始逐渐从功能定义转向场景定义。 这就不得不提到当前市场上最成功的产品，即Meta与雷朋合作推出的第二代智能眼镜。 这款看似普通的雷朋太阳镜，在2023年推出后却意外成为爆款。 没有AR显示，也不靠科幻外观取胜，它主打拍照、录像、听音乐、打电话以及搭载AI的视觉识别能力，功能虽然有限，但在用户的真实生活场景中几乎为零学习成本。 2024年，雷朋Meta智能眼镜销量超过100万副，在2025年初，全球累计销量已突破200万副，市场占有率超过60%。 市场研究机构甚至指出，光是该产品就带动了2024年全球智能眼镜市场同比增长210%，为整个行业带来了希望。 品牌营销专家Michael Miraflor便是用户之一，他形容这款眼镜更像是升级版的AirPods，他在户外活动、参加社交聚会甚至日常打电话时都常佩戴，并强调一点：“我愿意戴它，是因为它根本不像智能设备，它像一副我原本就会戴的雷朋眼镜。” 这正是雷朋Meta的突破之处，它不是让用户适应科技，而是让科技顺势融入生活方式。 而这一切的背后，离不开雷朋母公司眼镜巨头陆逊梯卡集团的全盘布局。 这个全球最大的光学集团，正主动跳出传统角色，走向潮流文化的前线。 过去一年里动作频频，包括从VF集团手中收购曾经教父级的街头潮流品牌Supreme，于今年2月任命A$AP Rocky为雷朋史上首位品牌创意总监，在前几天又宣布与Travis Scott达成合作，让他担任集团旗下运动品牌Oakley的首位品牌愿景官，与Cactus Jack团队共同定义品牌的未来风格与表达。 借助潮流人物与文化叙事的双重加持，该集团集团正在将眼镜从一个功能性配件，转化为下一代年轻人生活方式的标志。 延续雷朋的热度，Meta也在今年与Oakley 推出新款智能眼镜，强化拍摄、防水与续航性能，专为骑行、滑雪、水上运动等高动感场景设计，精准切入那些已有但尚未被科技深度服务的使用缺口。 Meta与Oakley合作推出的高性能人工智能眼镜
回看谷歌在在今年与Kering Eyewear、Warby Parker和Gentle Monster的三项合作，不难看出谷歌瞄准的场景需求揽括了奢侈品牌聚焦国际旅行和社交场合、高街品牌主攻日常通勤与功能性、潮流品牌则渗透年轻人的娱乐与互动需求，通过实际合作测试更有效的场景链接。 智能眼镜能否真正走入大众视野，还必须穿越一个最隐蔽却最根本的门槛——用户接受度。 这不仅是对产品功能的判断，更关乎个人审美、社交习惯与文化心理的深层认同。..."

mov_E5F552AD2971E77FCB6BCD9F840B414E,2025-06-26 05:23:34,zh-tw,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[zh-tw]韓國法院對於NewJeans成員「禁止獨立活動」的臨時處分，自今年1月13日ADOR向法院申請禁令開始，經過二次聽證、二次NewJeans提出異議上訴，終於在6月17日確定「維持禁令」。 之後其實有給NewJeans一週的時間提出抗告，結果直到6月24日截止日，成員們都未再提出抗告，於是法院發佈「禁令正式生效」，並有更多與禁令相關的細節曝光，等同全面封殺NewJeans的演藝之路。 「獨立活動禁令」更多詳細內容
據報導，NewJeans五名成員截至24日為止，未向ADOR禁止其獨立活動的臨時處分，再次提出抗告，因此最終確定NewJeans成員未經ADOR事先批准同意，不得自行或通過ADOR以外協力廠商進行演藝活動。 演藝活動禁令包括：詞曲創作、演奏、演唱、錄音等音樂人活動；電視節目出演；商業登台演出；廣告合約簽訂及出演；以及基於大眾文化藝術工作者身份，許可的所有商業活動。 簡單來說，就是NewJeans被全面封殺了！ 不僅當歌手，連主持、演戲都不行，若違約，每次活動需向ADOR支付10億韓元賠償金。 儘管有粉絲認為，這個等同「全面封殺」的禁令，在合約主訴訟解決之後，便會自動解除，但大家心知肚明，目前主訴訟才進行到一審，之後還可能有二審三審，曠日廢時。 這也表示NewJeans將面臨長時間的空窗期，對她們的職業生涯和粉絲群，都可能產生不利的影響。 敗訴違約金恐高達145億台幣
至於NewJeans合約主訴訟，目前進行到一審的第3次開庭辯論，即將於7月24日舉行。 但是後面很可能還會有第4次、第5次辯論，據悉，這種開庭次數並沒有法律上限，關鍵在於法官何時認為事實已查清，可以作出判決，並據此宣告「辯論終結」。 即便所有辯論結束，一審結果出爐，不管NewJeans、ADOR誰敗訴，都可能再上訴，那又要接著面對二審、三審。 目前已知，訴訟雙方都投入巨額律師費，NewJeans律師團有13人，ADOR律師團則有 12人，在在都反映雙邊非贏不可的決心。 不過韓網論壇大多不看好NewJeans，因為「獨立活動禁令」已經表示，她們與ADOR的合約是有效的，在沒有新證據出現的情況下，這次的臨時裁決，對她們的合約主訴訟相當不利。 就算主訴訟全部結束，最多也是讓NewJeans付出代價（賠錢）換取解約，幾乎不可能依照她們要求的：解約且不付違約金。 據報導，NewJeans若敗訴，一是繼續履行原合約，二是承擔解約賠償，預估違約金將高達4000-6000億韓元（約97億-145億台幣）。 NewJeans代言品牌陸續終止
儘管NewJeans成員Danielle在6月18日，以名錶品牌Omega全球大使的身份，出席了日本京都活動，但這是在ADOR合約範圍內同意的品牌活動，事實上，NewJeans的許多代言已陸續解約。 畢竟這場官司並非短時間就能判決下來，拖個一、二年恐怕連廠商的商譽都會元氣大傷，他們實在等不起，目前已知的解約品牌包括：
手機代言由aespa接替、可樂代言換成NMIXX隊長吳海嫄、Stray Kids接棒她們代言的餅乾、耳環項鍊品牌代言已從官網下架、另一家運動品牌也在找其他新的代言人。 此外，新韓銀行合約於2024年12月到期未續約，仁川機場海關宣傳大使也在2025年3月合約到期未續簽，至於Minji的香奈兒代言，據傳已移出代言名單。 NewJeans如今仍確定保有的代言，只剩下美瞳品牌OLENS，以及Danielle代言的Omega、Hanni代言的Gucci。 到底NewJeans會不會如彗星般閃亮登場，又如彗星般一閃而過呢？ 大家都在等著看。 更多影劇娛樂相關：

Broken sleep. Living on caffeine and convenience snacks. Working late because it's the only time the house is still. Trying to create “me time” that ends up being catch-up time. It's the perfect storm for cortisol dysregulation — and when cortisol is out of sync, it shows up everywhere: mood crashes, cravings, bloating, weight retention, inflammation, brain fog… and sleep that doesn't actually restore you. I'm writing an article on Cortisol and Postpartum for my substack, the article isn't done yet. Because life. But when it is, I hope it helps make sense of this season — not to fix it all, but to offer support, clarity, and solidarity. And if you're still showing up during this time.

mov_3EF74AEB54D190EFCBACD325DFD90575,2025-06-26 10:14:11,en,WEB,"  Over 10 years designing for her Wales Bonner label, Grace Wales Bonner has dressed discerning celebrities from Jude Bellingham to Letitia Wright. For the Met Gala in May, she created outfits for Lewis Hamilton, FKA Twigs and Jeff Goldblum. But for her show in Paris on a sweltering Wednesday evening, there was a shift to a new generation on the catwalk. Liam Gallagher's son Gene, Bobby Gillespie's son Wolf and Myles Lewis-Skelly, Arsenal's 18-year-old midfielder and left-back, who broke into the first team in the 2024/25 season, modelled. The collection was shown in a room full of bookshelves – fitting for a brand inspired by writers from James Baldwin to Nikki Giovanni, whose poem My Tower (Pretty Little Baby) was on the show notes. Titled Jewel, it featured Wales Bonner looking at archetypes of clothing and perfecting them through her specific lens. Standout designs included a hunting jacket cut to accentuate the wearer's waist, a tailored black suit with brown lapels and jumpers in a melange knit, worn with shorts. Different takes on glamour were explored, from the sequin chiffon shirt and lowslung jeans worn by Gillespie, to Lewis-Skelly's simple silk shirt and trousers and models in tailcoats, carrying gloves. The collection once again had that signature Wales Bonner secret sauce: clothes that felt conceptual enough for a catwalk show, but were also seriously desirable. Those in the front row were likely making mental shopping lists as the models came down the catwalk. Backstage, Wales Bonner said she was thinking about “people who collect specific types of clothing, and what that wardrobe looks like”. She focused that around “mixing sports heritage and casual preppy language, and fine tailoring”. Part of the inspiration came from working on the Met Gala and its accompanying exhibition, Superfine, with the theme of Black style and dandyism. “I wanted to have some sense of continuity and think about that character,” she said. “What would they wear in a more everyday way?” She said working with Hamilton had been particularly important. “He has been so supportive of me over the years, it's so special for him to give me the opportunity on such a world stage. [It was a] really inspiring process, there were definitely things I took from that language.” The milestone of the brand reaching a decade was also on her mind. “The learnings I've had over the last 10 years, that's in everything I put forward and think about the future,” she said. “I feel like I've got enough confidence and I've built enough of a language and identity, we can be a bit relaxed.” The designer's influence has increased over that time, along with the brand. In April, it was reported that the brand expected to end the financial year with 81% growth compared with the previous year, with revenue doubling since 2022. The designer's collaboration with Adidas, begun in 2020, is central to this. It has helped the sports brand boom over the past few years – everyone from Rihanna to Rishi Sunak has started wearing her popular silver and leopard print Samba shoe. This collection moved the narrative on – it debuted a collaboration with Y-3, the Adidas label that originally started as partnership between the sports brand and Yohji Yamamoto. On the catwalk, this was seen in a tracktop and shorts, as well as football boot-like sneakers. These shoes, described by Wales Bonner as “quite iconic”, could well be the next Samba. The opening of Balenciaga by Demna, an exhibition showcasing items created by the mononymic designer over his decade at the brand, also too place on Wednesday. Displaying designs including the leather bag that looks like the IKEA Frakta, a skirt made out of a towel and a cap with branding similar to that of Bernie Saunders' 2016 election campaign, it demonstrated how influential Demna's pop art-like take on luxury has been. As he moves to a job designing for Gucci, Pierpaolo Piccioli, formerly of Valentino, will take over at Balenciaga. Piccioli was present at this opening, possibly to absorb the Balenciaga of his predecessor. His first collection for the brand will debut in October."

mov_355914962B3FF52496F3AD00CF54B847,2025-06-26 10:39:28,en,WEB,"  Designer brands such as Coach, Fendi, and Hugo Boss have been listed as buyers of raw materials sourced from destroyed forests in Pará, the northern Brazilian state set to host the UN Climate Conference, COP30, in November. The allegations, which most companies deny, are detailed in a report published by Earthsight, a UK-based nonprofit focused on environmental and injustice investigations. Their findings draw on thousands of records of Brazilian leather exports, data on the cattle sector, court rulings, satellite imagery, as well as interviews and on-the-ground research. ""Consumers probably expect that when buying a luxury product, the high price tag guarantees some level of ethics and sustainability, "" Lara Shirra White, an Earthsight researcher told DW. ""They don't expect that the leather bag might be linked to deforestation and human rights violations."" The NGO warns of products made from the hides of cattle reared on farms embargoed for environmental violations. Including some operating illegally within Pará's Apyterewa Indigenous Territory, which was heavily deforested during Jair Bolsonaro's presidency. As part of its research, Earthsight investigated the business operations of Frigol, a Brazilian meatpacking company identified as one of the buyers of cattle raised on the territory. The report says at least 17,000 animals were sold to Frigol between 2020 and 2023, which is ""enough to produce 425 tons of leather. Researchers link some of those cattle to illegal farms but say it is not possible to determine the exact number that left Apyterewa, in part because Frigol itself ""does not trace most of its indirect suppliers."" It says this gap in reporting leaves the company's ""supply chain vulnerable to the widespread practice of 'cattle laundering,' "" in which cows from illegal farms are transferred to legally registered properties before being sold. Paulo Barreto, senior researcher at the Brazilian conservation and sustainable development Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon (Imazon) said control over indirect suppliers is either non-existent or incomplete. ""As a result, cattle raised in illegally deforested areas end up entering the market as if they were legal. The lack of a transparent public system regarding the origin of the cattle makes control difficult."" Frigol, however, told DW via email that it does not purchase cattle from Indigenous lands and monitors 100% of its direct suppliers. ""We are committed to working together with industry institutions, the production chain, and public authorities to make progress, "" the company said in a statement. Adding that it believes ""only individual traceability of animals for socio-environmental purposes will make it possible to mitigate deforestation across all links of the cattle supply chain."" Brazilian leather, Italian prestige According to the Earthsight research, after the animals are slaughtered at Frigol's facilities, a percentage of cowskins are exported. In part by the Brazilian leather company Durlicouros, which shipped 14,700 tons of hide to Italy between 2020 and 2023. Some of that, the report found, went to the European tanneries Conceria Cristina and Faeda. The research lists high-end names like Coach, Fendi, Chloé, Hugo Boss and Saint Lauren among Conceria Cristina's clients. Faeda, meanwhile, provides leather to brands such as Chanel, Balenciaga and Gucci, according to the investigation. In response to a DW request for comment, Chanel cited deforestation as a ""major concern "" and said it no longer works with Faeda due to unmet traceability requirements. ""92% of the calfskin we use is sourced from Europe, and we audit slaughterhouses and farms outside Europe to ensure they are not in deforestation zones. The Kering Group, which owns Balenciaga, Gucci, and Saint Laurent, told DW that while the two Italian companies mentioned in the report are suppliers, ""the leather they provide to any Kering house does not come from Brazil."" Based on Earthsight's findings, Hugo Boss issued a statement to say it had conducted a detailed review, and could ""confirm that none of the leather "" it is supplied ""is connected to any of the alleged parties in connection with the investigation. "" LVMH, which owns Fendi and Louis Vuitton, says it has a system capable of tracing the origin of 98% of the leather used in its products and that it does not source this from South America. And Tapestry, which owns the Coach brand, wrote to DW saying that while the system for tracking raw materials in Brazil is ""complex and imperfect, "" it is working to be ""part of the solution to improve traceability and transparency."" Chloé, Conceria Cristina and Faeda had not responded to request for comment at the time of publication. Flaws in the certification system Durlicouros told DW that it tracks its indirect suppliers and participates in discussions on state and national models for full traceability and compliance. ""In addition, all Durlicouros facilities are certified by the Leather Working Group (LWG), ensuring high standards of sustainability, traceability, and environmental responsibility, according to the purpose of each facility."" But Earthsight researcher Lara Shirra White said companies often use the certification to vouch for the ethics and sustainability of the leather they produce..."

北韓領導人金正恩24日與妻子李雪主、女兒金主愛，一同出席大型海濱度假村「元山葛麻海岸旅遊區」的落成典禮，金正恩稱讚該渡假村是北韓今年「最偉大的創舉」之一，預計在7/1開放後，每年吸引2萬名遊客前來。 ▲金正恩與妻女一起欣賞民眾玩滑水道。 （圖／翻攝自朝中社）
金正恩在開幕典禮上表示，經過10多年，渡假村終於完工，成為「輝煌的現實」，還說這將為北韓建立旅遊文化發揮主導作用，然而《衛報》指出，這座渡假村目前只開放給當地觀光客，外國遊客想要體驗獨特的「北韓假期」，恐怕得再等等。 根據《朝中社》報導，元山葛麻海岸旅遊區位於北韓東岸，擁有體育、娛樂設施以及餐飲服務，金正恩說，他相信渡假村「帶動的幸福浪潮，將提升北韓作為世界級旅遊文化度假勝地的吸引力」，他也難得在鏡頭前，與家人愜意漫步在海灘。 ▲金正恩渡假村剪綵，女兒金主愛站C位。 （圖／翻攝朝中社）
根據《朝中社》26日刊出的照片，李雪主穿著褲裝，似乎手拿Gucci包，這可能違反聯合國禁止精品出口到北韓的規定，比起以往在公開場合的莊重，李雪主顯得輕鬆休閒，金主愛則穿著醒目的白色套裝，也是鎂光燈的焦點，外交部長崔善姬在金正恩一旁接待俄羅斯大使等外賓，金正恩的胞妹金與正，則站離他們一家人較遠。 金主愛今年約12歲，從2022年底以來就與金正恩一同出現在鏡頭前，也讓外界推測，她可能成為金正恩的接班人。 ▲金正恩對渡假村完工相當自豪。 （圖／翻攝朝中社）

mzv3zcs,2025-06-26 11:21:17,en,REDDIT,"  I was in cdmx for 4 months earlier this year. Nice areas to stay- Roma, Condesa, Polanco, Napoles, del Valle. The East side of the city is regarded as less safe, there must be certain safe areas but I would need to speak to a local person to know for sure. In these areas, it is safe to walk around by yourself as a woman, even at night. Just take the usual precautions. Public transport is totally fine, I travelled on the metro and metrobus alone, even late at night with no issues. It gets very crowded at rush hour, sardines in a can. There is a section at the front (you'll see it, it has pink seats) for women, children and disabled. I always prefer this section. If you want to go by car, use Uber. When taxi drivers see that you aren't mexican, you will be overcharged. Oaxaca is super touristy. It's walkable so you don't really need to use Uber. I used the collectivos to get around the state of oaxaca and never had any problems with overcharging. They all turned up when they were supposed to. You don't really have to dress conservatively. Although I would say Mexicans are more casual dressers in general (compared to western europeans) so if you come in your Gucci and diamonds it will attract attention haha. Regular summer clothes are fine, you can wear shorts and tank tops with no issues. Remember though, it's not the beach. Temp drops at night so bring a jacket or hoodie.

18016734113535274,2025-06-26 11:30:07,zh,INSTAGRAM,  | #YD時尚專題 | — • — — — • • — • • • — — 近年眾多時尚集團開始收回眼鏡業務，眼鏡系列和太陽眼鏡系列成為時尚品牌的「兵家必爭之地」，但是Gentle Monster確實逐漸打破Kering集團、LVMH集團和Richemont集團「三國鼎立」的局面，就連LVMH集團旗下的私募基金L Catterton同樣投資Gentle Monster。不過誰也沒有想過最近Google宣佈花費一億美金，收購Gentle Monster百分之四的股份，亦是象徵Gentle Monster估值超過二十五億美金。那麼Google為何邀請Gentle Monster攜手合作？ • 〝風靡亞洲的Gentle Monster〞 2011年，金韓國創立Gentle Monster。其實Gentle Monster能夠迅速風靡亞洲，主要原因在於金韓國具備「先發制人」的目光，深諳如何善用韓國電視劇集的「Product Placement」俘虜年輕世代。例如Gentle Monster曾經贊助《來自星星的你》，當中全智賢飾演的千頌伊不但掀起熱烈討論，眾多時尚造型甚至引發粗暴的模仿效應，而且Gentle Monster的專門店總會讓人留下深刻印象。2017年，LVMH集團旗下的私募基金L Catterton決定投資Gentle Monster！ • 〝Google重新佈局智能眼鏡市場〞 八年時間過去，Gentle Monster更是獲得Google的青睞，並且宣佈花費一億美金，收購Gentle Monster百分之四的股份，共同研發延展實境的智能眼鏡，亦讓Gentle Monster估值超過二十五億美金，同時象徵Google將會重新佈局智能眼鏡市場。不過除了Gentle Monster外，Google的合作對象更加囊括Kering Eyewear和Warby Parker，顯然Google試圖透過Gentle Monster、Kering Eyewear和Warby Parker，瞄準三個截然不同的市場！ • 〝戛然而止的Google Glass系列〞 2013年，Google曾經推出Google Glass系列，而且為了爭奪女性消費市場，Google亦於2013年春夏系列邀請Diane von Furstenberg攜手合作，Diane von Furstenberg、Sergey Brin和Yvan Mispelaere特別佩戴Google Glass系列現身謝幕。除此以外，Google更於美國《Vogue》的「September Issue」刊登內頁廣告，並且經由Steven Klein負責掌鏡。由此可見，Google除了善用《Vogue》建立「奢華」的屬性外，更加透過日常生活的敘事方式，賦予現代女性認識Google Glass系列的機會！ • 〝智能眼鏡難以征服大眾市場〞 儘管Amazon和Microsoft等等同樣嘗試佈局智能眼鏡市場，分別帶來Echo Frames系列和Microsoft HoloLens系列，可惜至今還是沒有辦法征服大眾市場，直至EssilorLuxottica集團旗下的Oakley和Ray-Ban，搭載Meta AI應用程式，顛覆年輕世代對於「智能眼鏡」的想像。始終Ray-Ban運用經典的Headliner系列、Skyler系列和Wayfarer系列作為基礎，社會大眾甚至不用浪費時間重新學習如何使用智能眼鏡，亦讓智能眼鏡能夠滿足各種不同場合！ • 〝為何投資Gentle Monster〞 其實這次Google邀請Gentle Monster、Kering Eyewear和Warby Parker攜手合作，就是為了瞄準三個截然不同的市場。例如自從2011年創立至今，Gentle Monster總會善用「流量明星」和「帶貨女王」的影響力，持續不斷創造話題和撬動輿論，就像先後邀請BLACKPINK的JENNIE和aespa的KARINA攜手合作，俘虜追逐潮流趨勢的年輕世代，因此Google決定投資Gentle Monster，主要原因還是Gentle Monster的目標群眾，更加願意接受「科技」！ • 〝如何瞄準三個截然不同的市場〞 另外，Kering Eyewear和Warby Parker作為Google的合作對象，則是聚焦富豪名媛和社會大眾，讓人高度期待Kering集團旗下的Balenciaga、Bottega Veneta、Gucci、McQueen和Saint Laurent將會如何擁抱「科技」，而且Kering Eyewear亦會負責生產和銷售Richemont集團旗下的眼鏡業務。至於Warby Parker制定價格的商業策略，亦讓智能眼鏡迅速征服大眾市場！ — • — — — • • — • • • — — #GentleMonster #Google #รีเบคก้าแพทรีเซียอาร์มสตรอง #RebeccaPatriciaArmstrong #เบคกี้ #Becky #สโรชาจันทร์กิมฮะ #SarochaChankimha #ฟรีน #freen

We make it same using original fragrances from France but basically cheaper. So 30,50,80 ML. And we name the product differently like Savage d'Or, or Gocci bloom instead of Gucci bloom.

Lips curled like a question mark around teeth clenched tight with secrets. And no one asked the right one: “What are you hiding behind that light?” 'Cause baby, behind this smile is a graveyard of swallowed screams, a closet full of don't-tell-nobody dreams, a face beat flawless, but the soul? Unseen. Unclean. Under construction with caution tape no one ever reads. Behind that smile, she bruises in designer. He shatters in Gucci. They laugh in limelight but sleep beside silence so loud it cancels applause. Behind that smile is a child still waiting to be rescued, a woman pretending sex equals love, a man who ain't cried since '92 because his daddy said “boys don't feel” and that commandment became law. Behind that smile is the house that ain't a home, the hand that once held love now controls with chrome. It's red carpets and court cases, baby showers and restraining orders. Private jets to hell with a mimosa in hand. Don't let the twinkle fool you. Behind the sparkle is a storm praying not to show up on camera. Behind the “I'm good!” is a voicemail she won't check because it might be her breaking point calling back. Let me be clear: not all smiles are lies but a damn lot are lullabies sung to lull our pain to sleep. And I get it—..."

mov_437D6391A74B1B2B9B621915AA620EA4,2025-06-26 16:41:38,en,WEB,"  Why did Aritzia open a café inside its flagship store in Toronto? Why did Burberry pivot from fashion photography to cinematic ads that transport viewers into dreamlike sequences? And why is Simons, Canada's remaining department store, incorporating art and interactive technologies into its retail spaces? The answer lies in a trend known as escapist marketing. In an era marked by economic uncertainty, climate anxiety, geopolitical tensions and relentless digital fatigue, brands are turning to fantasy, storytelling and emotionally immersive design to sell products to consumers. Escapist marketing is a strategy that creates emotionally immersive experiences to help consumers temporarily escape from reality, often through fantasy, nostalgia or idealized lifestyles. It taps into the desire for relief from stress or monotony by offering imaginative or aspirational narratives. Escapist marketing has been gaining traction in Canada as consumers are drawn to brands that spark imagination and emotional engagement. According to a 2024 Retail Council of Canada report, Gen Z shoppers prefer brands that offer emotional connection, purpose and creativity. The inaugural Great Canadian Brand Index, which one of us (Eugene Y. Chan) helped develop, found that brands perceived as adventurous, honest and imaginative scored highest in overall public favourability. These are precisely the qualities expressed through fantastical storytelling. As marketing professors and researchers, we've been studying how and why this approach works, and we've found it's grounded in psychology. While brands have long used aspiration in their marketing, today's strategies feel noticeably different. The focus has shifted from luxury and exclusivity to escapism itself, and it's becoming increasingly visible across industries. Consider Coca-Cola's “Real Magic” campaign, for instance, which uses AI-generated imagery to create whimsical dreamscapes. Or Apple's recent “Mother Nature” ad, which reframes a corporate report about the brand's support of environmental and social issues as a high-concept film starring Octavia Spencer. In London, Gucci's “Gucci Cosmos” series invites visitors into a surreal world of time travel and design history. These marketing campaigns are all designed to be emotional experiences for consumers. This means that the emotional reactions consumers have during interactions with a brand, product or service influence their attitudes, memories and future decision-making. These emotions deepen engagement and strengthen brand loyalty. As consumers continue to feel burned out and overstimulated, fantasy in the form of escapism offers them mental relief. Research shows that immersive experiences — whether through entertainment, retail environments or brand storytelling — can distract from stressors and promote emotional recovery. By providing a temporary break from reality, fantasy-driven marketing taps into a deep psychological need for comfort and cognitive release. To understand why escapist marketing is so effective, it helps to look at the psychology behind it. One explanation comes from construal level theory, a framework that examines how psychological distance shapes thinking. When something feels far away in time, space or familiarity, we tend to think about it more abstractly. Surreal or fantastical branding increases this distance, shifting consumers' focus from immediate utility to emotional resonance, identity and imagination. While escapist marketing is a broader strategy that aims to help consumers mentally disengage from reality, surreal or fantastical branding is one specific tactic that uses dreamlike, imaginative visuals and narratives to achieve that goal. Not all escapist marketing is surreal, but surreal branding often serves as a powerful form of escapism by transporting consumers into an alternate world. Our research supports this. In one study, we explored how concave visual design — where ad elements curve inward — draws viewers into the imagery, increases feelings of immersion and enhances message recall and persuasion. This is likely why dreamlike campaigns often use fluid, expansive or distorted imagery. Another factor is anthropomorphism: the tendency to assign human traits to objects or environments. In our studies on destination branding, we found that people are more emotionally connected to places or products that seem to come alive. These findings help explain why fantastical branding resonates so strongly with consumers, particularly in times of stress. Escapism also pairs naturally with luxury branding, where emotional desire often outweighs functional need. In a recent study with our research colleagues, we found that luxury brands were evaluated more favourably when their positioning felt abstract or elevated. Fantasy enhances this effect, allowing consumers to feel both wealthier and transported. There's a fine line between meaningful escapism and empty spectacle. If a brand's fantasy narrative feels disconnected from its action, or appears to mask unethical practices, consumers are quick to notice. Greenwashing, AI overuse or tone-deaf advertising can easily backfire on businesses. When consumers perceive a brand as inauthentic — whether through misleading sustainability claims, excessive reliance on AI or insensitive messaging — it can erode trust, trigger public criticism and lead to brand avoidance. Studies show that such missteps often result in reputational damage and decreased customer loyalty, particularly among values-driven or socially aware consumers This is where the concept of radical honesty intersects with escapism. The most effective marketing campaigns today blend creativity with transparency. They tell imaginative stories while also acknowledging real-world issues like carbon emissions, labour practices and social justice issues. Brands like Patagonia — and Peace Collective in Canada that's working in conjunction with McDonalds — have managed to strike this balance by combining emotionally impactful ad campaigns with commitments to ethical and sustainable practices. In times of economic stress and cultural fatigue, Canadians are seeking experiences that resonate with them. When done thoughtfully and grounded in psychology and authenticity, escapist marketing can respond to consumers' desire to feel something deeper, even via something as brief as a 30-second ad. So next time you find yourself smiling at a surreal commercial or lingering in a carefully curated retail space, understand that small moment of wonder is a strategic choice, supported by research...."

Today the Academy of Motion Picture Arts & Sciences has handed out its annual invitations to membership with 534 new invitees. If all of them accept the new totals of overall membership will be 11,120 of which 10,143 will be eligible to vote for Oscars and run for governance elections. 'Brokeback Mountain' Co-Writer ""Knew We Would Not Win"" Best Picture Oscar After Meeting Clint Eastwood Netflix Sets Prime Oscar Season Release Date For Sundance Acquisition 'Train Dreams' With Joel Edgerton And Felicity Jones Movie Academy Elects Board Of Governors For 2025-26, Adds 3 Governors-at-Large - Updated Among those on the list are newly minted Oscar winners Mikey Madison (Best Actress –Anora) and Kieran Culkin (Best Supporting Actor – A Real Pain). Among all the invitees this year 91 are past Oscar nominees including 26 winners. The prominent star names include Ariana Grande, Dave Bautista, Jodie Comer, Jason Momoa, Aubrey Plaza, Sebastian Stan, Jeremy Strong, Gillian Anderson, Stephen Graham, Andrew Scott, Danielle Deadwyler, and on and on. 41% of the new class are women, 45% belong to underrepresented communities, and 55% are from 60 countries and territories outside the United States. This will result in an AMPAS membership of 35% women overall, 22% underrepresented communities, and 21% international. By the way all Oscar nominees are automatically considered for membership while most others require two member sponsors. From my perusal of the list the most surprising new member is Neon head, Tom Quinn in the Executives branch. Considering his long tenure in the industry, and the fact that Neon has become a prominent presence at the Academy Awards, now with two Best Picture winners (Parasite, Anora) and multiple nominees, the apparent fact that he hasn't been an Oscar voter until today is eye-catching. Welcome to the Academy everyone.

mov_143F9D97260E964E9C1A3B4B9077CAB6,2025-06-26 18:30:00,en,WEB,"  Recent Oscar winners Mikey Madison, Kieran Culkin and Clément Ducol and Camille were among the 534 members of the film community invited to join the Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences. The Academy made the announcement on Thursday. The list of prospective new members, which tops last year's 487 (at the time the biggest group to be invited in four years), includes several other nominees for the 2025 Academy Awards: actors Ariana Grande, Monica Barbaro, Yura Borisov Adriana Paz, Margaret Qualley, Sebastian Stan, Jeremy Strong and Fernanda Torres; directors Coralie Fargeat and Brady Corbet; documentary filmmakers Yuval Abraham and Basel Adra (who won for “No Other Land”) producers Maria Carlota Bruno, Alex Coco and Samantha Quan; writer Greg Kwedar, Magnus von Horn and Gints Zilbalodis; editor Nick Emerson; and composers Daniel Blumberg (who won for “The Brutalist”), Abraham Alexander and Adrian Quesada and Brandi Carlile. (Notably, 2025 Best Actress nominee Karla Sofía Gascón was not invited.) Several invitees, including Corbet (“The Brutalist”), Fargeat (“The Substance”), Matīss Kaža (“Flow”), Ema Ryan Yamazaki (“Black Box Diaries”) and Molly O'Brien (“The Only Girl in the Orchestra”) were invited to join more than one branch. (Corbet and Fargeat were invited to both the directors and writers branches.) If they accept the Academy's invitation (most people do), they must choose one branch to belong to. With the latest group of invitees, total Academy membership will reach 11,120 and voting members will hit 10,143 — a significant milestone for an exclusive group that for years kept membership below 6,000 people. The growth reflects the Academy's near decade of efforts to diversify its ranks which, after the #OscarsSoWhite protests of 2016, were revealed to be 75% male and 90% white. This year's crop of newcomers reflects the Academy's sustained drive to double the number of women and people of color: 35% of the potential new members are women; 22% are from underrepresented ethnic and racial communities; and 21% are international. Here is the full list of people invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

tw_sl_c1c3430453572b58054c5b26d638a5d9,2025-06-26 19:23:02,en,WEB,"  Designer brands such as Coach, Fendi, and Hugo Boss have been listed as buyers of raw materials sourced from destroyed forests in Pará, the northern Brazilian state set to host the UN Climate Conference, COP30, in November. The allegations, which most companies deny, are detailed in a report published by Earthsight, a UK-based nonprofit focused on environmental and injustice investigations. Their findings draw on thousands of records of Brazilian leather exports, data on the cattle sector, court rulings, satellite imagery, as well as interviews and on-the-ground research. “Consumers probably expect that when buying a luxury product, the high price tag guarantees some level of ethics and sustainability,” Lara Shirra White, an Earthsight researcher, said. “They don't expect that the leather bag might be linked to deforestation and human rights violations.” The NGO warns of products made from the hides of cattle reared on farms embargoed for environmental violations, including some operating illegally within Pará's Apyterewa Indigenous Territory, which was heavily deforested during Jair Bolsonaro's presidency. As part of its research, Earthsight investigated the business operations of Frigol, a Brazilian meatpacking company identified as one of the buyers of cattle raised on the territory. The report says at least 17,000 animals were sold to Frigol between 2020 and 2023, which is “enough to produce 425 tons of leather.” Researchers link some of those cattle to illegal farms but say it is not possible to determine the exact number that left Apyterewa, in part because Frigol itself “does not trace most of its indirect suppliers.” It says this gap in reporting leaves the company's “supply chain vulnerable to the widespread practice of 'cattle laundering,'” in which cows from illegal farms are transferred to legally registered properties before being sold. Paulo Barreto, senior researcher at the Brazilian conservation and sustainable development Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon (Imazon), said control over indirect suppliers is either non-existent or incomplete. “As a result, cattle raised in illegally deforested areas end up entering the market as if they were legal. The lack of a transparent public system regarding the origin of the cattle makes control difficult.” Frigol, however, told via email that it does not purchase cattle from Indigenous lands and monitors 100% of its direct suppliers. “We are committed to working together with industry institutions, the production chain, and public authorities to make progress,” the company said in a statement. Adding that it believes “only individual traceability of animals for socio-environmental purposes will make it possible to mitigate deforestation across all links of the cattle supply chain.” Brazilian leather, Italian prestige According to Earthsight's research, after the animals are slaughtered at Frigol's facilities, a percentage of cowskins are exported, in part by the Brazilian leather company Durlicouros, which shipped 14,700 tons of hide to Italy between 2020 and 2023. Some of that, the report found, went to the European tanneries Conceria Cristina and Faeda. The research lists high-end names like Coach, Fendi, Chloé, Hugo Boss and Saint Lauren among Conceria Cristina's clients. Faeda, meanwhile, provides leather to brands such as Chanel, Balenciaga and Gucci, according to the investigation. Chanel cited deforestation as a “major concern” and said it no longer works with Faeda due to unmet traceability requirements. “92% of the calfskin we use is sourced from Europe, and we audit slaughterhouses and farms outside Europe to ensure they are not in deforestation zones.” The Kering Group, which owns Balenciaga, Gucci, and Saint Laurent, said that while the two Italian companies mentioned in the report are suppliers, “the leather they provide to any Kering house does not come from Brazil.” Based on Earthsight's findings, Hugo Boss issued a statement to say it had conducted a detailed review, and could “confirm that none of the leather” it is supplied “is connected to any of the alleged parties in connection with the investigation.” LVMH, which owns Fendi and Louis Vuitton, says it has a system capable of tracing the origin of 98% of the leather used in its products and that it does not source this from South America. And Tapestry, which owns the Coach brand, said that while the system for tracking raw materials in Brazil is “complex and imperfect,” it is working to be “part of the solution to improve traceability and transparency.” Chloé, Conceria Cristina and Faeda had not responded to a request for comment at the time of publication. Flaws in the certification system Durlicouros stated that it tracks its indirect suppliers and participates in discussions on state and national models for full traceability and compliance. “In addition, all Durlicouros facilities are certified by the Leather Working Group (LWG), ensuring high standards of sustainability, traceability, and environmental responsibility, according to the purpose of each facility.” But Earthsight researcher Lara Shirra White said companies often use the certification to vouch for the ethics and sustainability of the leather they produce “instead of conducting meaningful due diligence themselves to ensure their supply chains are deforestation-free.” She says the problem with the LWG, founded in 2005, is that “it does not require traceability back to the farms,” and can therefore not account for environmental and human rights abuses in the areas where the cattle are raised. The LWG said it is enhancing its “due diligence requirements related to deforestation and land conversion,” which will “include establishing a chain of custody system that would support more detailed traceability across the leather value chain.” Can a shift come via Europe? There is some hope that the European Union's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) could make a contribution to change. Due to come into effect at the end of this year after a 12-month delay, it will ban the purchase of products originating from destroyed forest areas. “We hope the law will be implemented on schedule, despite certain sectors of the industry still trying, in some way, to exclude leather from the scope of the legislation,” Rafael Pieroni, a researcher at Earthsight, stated. However, he said the report also contains a message for the Brazilian government. “It should implement traceability and make all data public. Transparency is the best way to avoid all the illegalities we are exposing in our investigation.” DW"

mzxxfti,2025-06-26 19:55:19,en,REDDIT,"  Could any of you recommend a reliable source for discontinued fragrances? The actual fragrances, not reproductions. So far I've purchased the discontinued fragrances Gucci Guilty for women (original), Chanel Gabrielle Essence, and Jesus Del Pozo Halloween Mia Me Mine. Each of them has had that unpleasant metallic smell that perfumes get when they turn. I've ordered variously from Amazon as a direct seller, and Amazon and EBay third party sellers with ratings above 98%. Are there any quality sellers out there who have been storing the fragrances correctly? Or are you always just taking a chance? I see people online saying that vintage fragrances won't go bad if they're unopened and stored in a cool, dark place. Maybe I'm hoping for too much?"

UgxAmB68a-H9Tvy61bh4AaABAg,2025-06-26 21:50:11,en,YOUTUBE,"  sorry for the essay, but allow me to reminisce. An '07 was my first car during peak-Prius (~2010?) . As a kid with no real income or hope of an alternative, i just tanked the teasing from my peers and learned a lot about it. Eventually though, the Prius was vindicated, everyone else went broke paying for gas on their hand-me-down SUVs. In retrospect it was a good first car and its slowness + guaranteed understeer likely kept me alive. I think '04 and '05 had smoked upper tail lights, so it tried to look continuous with the lower rear window which was also tinted. I get what they were going for, but I think the revised full-altezza lights is better. the dash design/cockpit is genius bc it lets toyota swap for LHD / RHD with only minimal tooling changes. The entire center stack can be basically the same. There are very few buttons/wiring that would need to be redesigned. At least by 07 they had HVAC + defroster buttons on the steering wheel. I remember this vividly bc my CA driving exam required showing the proctor where the defrost buttons are before turning on the car. I got docked points since I said the defrost control was in the screen (which was off). The proctor, having probably done thousands of tests in a prius by that point, smugly pointed out the button on the wheel. Car in this vid has the revised screen software with nicer graphics. Earlier ones are more grey and blocky. The red theme setting goes much harder than the greenblue, even if it doesnt match the physical button backlighting. They made a lot of tiny changes throughout the production run, selling so many it probably made sense ROI wise to do so. Its always cool to see other model years of my former car. I don't think my nav-less prius had a labeled map button. The one option package mine did have was keyless start / entry, so the key slot was only used if the key's battery died. at the time, keyless entry/start was new and mostly on high end cars, so everyone thought it was super cool and futuristic. The shifter was also a new idea at the time, in that it returns to center after you select a gear. Anyone that drove my car would need this explained to them, but now it is very common. The cargo area was great. Can hold a lot of cargo, and with the seats down multiple ppl could lie flat...a feature that some teenagers probably appreciated... The 'touring' trim was interesting, since it had larger wheels and an extended rear spoiler so everyone could tell if you had the gucci prius. I believe european(?) models, had a button where you could run on battery only for like a mile, and this could be added to USDM models relatively easily. After >15 years in service and zero major repairs (toyota quality is real), the traction battery  started to die and activate limp mode. We cleared the OBD codes, and Carmax bought it off us for some crazy amount, like >$4000. By then, remanufactured batteries were pretty cost-effective so i imagine they still profited even with that repair and it is likely still running today delivering doordash orders. great car all in all."

mov_5CA7E561A730C167E5A1B3D1E1503228,2025-06-26 22:48:23,en,WEB,"  June 26 (UPI) -- U.S. Customs and Border Protection agents have seized a cache of counterfeit Rolex watches and designer sunglasses with a street value of more than $573,000, the agency announced Thursday. The items were headed to Pittsburgh and were intercepted by local CBP agents there. ""The international trade in counterfeit consumer goods is illegal,"" a release from the CBP said. ""It steals trademark holders and tax revenues from the government, it funds international criminal organizations, and the unregulated products can threaten the health and safety of American consumers."" The label on the shipment, from the United Arab Emirates, was marked ""Empty Poly Bag Ladies Hand Bags,"" but instead contained a half dozen counterfeit Rolex Perpetual Cosmograph Daytona watches, a pair of counterfeit Rolex Diamond iced-Out watches and counterfeit Burberry, Chanel, Gucci, Miu and Valentino sunglasses. Agents suspected that the watches and sunglasses were counterfeit and detained them for further inspection when they arrived in Pittsburgh. CBP sent photos and documentation to the Center of Excellence and Expertise and worked with trademark holders, which determined that the items were counterfeit and subject to immediate seizure by Border Patrol agents. ""Unsuspecting consumers could be victimized twice by counterfeit products,"" a statement from James Hindes, CBP's acting port director in Pittsburgh, said, ""such as these fake Rolex watches, because they may end up paying close to authentic prices for cheaper knockoffs, and they'll learn that the product isn't warrantied should it need repair."" The seizure of the counterfeit Rolex watches and sunglasses in Pittsburgh comes just days after CBP intercepted 5 shipments of fake jewelry over 2 nights in Louisville, Ky. that would have been worth more than $25 million had it been authentic."

mov_C46D3F6674132C0F5D6E1872BC6BA1F4,2025-06-27 00:00:00,en,WEB,"  The first recording today starts with the end of Rocket Boy and Toro. There's a trail for The Sarah Jane Adventures finale. Then it's a repeat of The Sarah Jane Adventures - Warriors of Kudlak - Part 2. Media Centre Description: Children's drama series from the makers of Doctor Who, following the adventures of investigative journalist Sarah Jane Smith, a former companion to the Doctor. Luke and Clyde have been kidnapped to be drafted as soldiers in an endless inter-galactic war. Recorded from CBBC Channel on Monday 15th December 2008 07:28  BBC Genome: CBBC Channel Monday 15th December 2008 07:30  After this there's a trail for Ed and Oucho. Ten the recording ends with the start of an episode of M.I. High. The next recording starts with the end of Get 100. Then it's the final episode of series 2 of The Sarah Jane Adventures - Enemy of the Bane: Part 2. Clyde and Luke hold off the Bane with a garden hose. Mrs Wormwood destroys the two Bane. It's a bit gungy. They go to the florist shop, but Kaagh is there, and together he and Wormwood force them to give her the Tunguska scroll. Luke agrees to go with Wormwood in return for them not killing the others. This episode is just chock full of ""No, Luke, I am your mother"". The very angry Major Kilburne is creeping around Sarah Jane's house, and is discovered by Rani's mum, who offers him a cup of tea. The Brigadier's car number plate is XCX. That's so Brat. Wormwood activates the scroll. Luke somehow intuits that the scroll is just a pointer to where the alien intelligence Horath can be found. ""The scroll is a receiver, isn't it? It's searching for a homing signal from Horath. It's not so much a map as a Sat Nav."" Wordwood explains that Horath is a cybernetic organism. ""A computer that can command the physical laws of the universe. That can destroy worlds and give birth to them in the blink of an eye."" She calls Luke ""her prince"" and gives him the scroll. At which point he runs off with it. There's some chasing and explosions. Wormwood has to protect Luke from Kaagh, and keep him under control with her magic ring. Major Kilburne catches them back at Sarah Jane's house. Another sign of him being a psycho is him holding his gun sideways. But Clyde is able to knock him over, and the Brigadier keeps a lookout while Sarah Jane searches for Luke. It's not surprising, then when Kilburne reveals himself to be another Bane. ""No, Sir Alistair. Remember, I invited you to dinner. And you're it!"" The Brigadier shoots him with an arrow from his cane gun. The Horath portal is located at a stone circle. Mrs Wormwood still wants Luke to rule the universe at her side as her Prince. And she's no longer interested in working with Kaagh so she zaps him with her ring. But Sarah Jane and the gang arrive, and Luke makes his choice. It's all about the hugs. ""Whoops! The National Trust is gonna be pleased about that - a stone circle with a black hole in the middle!"" ""I'd pay to see it."" Wormwood says ""Come to me, Luke. Come to your mother."" ""No. Sarah Jane is my mother.""..."

mov_8E3FFAFCFE4A5F335E450514343B7452,2025-06-27 04:05:18,en,WEB,"  DENVER (AP) — A Colorado funeral home owner accused of stashing nearly 190 dead bodies in a decrepit building and sending grieving families fake ashes is set to be sentenced Friday in federal court for cheating customers and defrauding the government out of nearly $900,000 in COVID-19 aid. Jon Hallford, owner of Return to Nature Funeral Home, pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud last year and faces a maximum of 20 years in prison. Federal prosecutors are seeking a 15-year sentence. He's pleaded guilty in a separate state case to 191 counts of corpse abuse. Hallford and co-owner Carie Hallford were accused of storing the bodies between 2019 and 2023 and sending families fake ashes. Investigators described finding the bodies in 2023 stacked atop each other throughout a squat, bug-infested building in Penrose, a small town about a two-hour drive south of Denver. The morbid discovery revealed to many families that their loved ones weren't cremated and that the ashes they had spread or cherished were fake. In two cases, the wrong body was buried, according to court documents. Many families said it undid their grieving processes. Some relatives had nightmares, others have struggled with guilt, and at least one wondered about their loved one's soul. Federal prosecutors accused both Hallfords of pandemic aid fraud, siphoning the aid and spending it and customer's payments on a GMC Yukon and Infiniti worth over $120,000 combined, along with $31,000 in cryptocurrency, luxury items from stores like Gucci and Tiffany & Co., and even laser body sculpting. Carie Hallford is scheduled to go to trial in the federal case in September, the same month as her next hearing in the state case in which she's also charged with 191 counts of corpse abuse. In a court filing requesting a 10-year sentence, Jon Hallford's attorneys said that “Mr. Hallford does not disagree that his conduct was abhorrent, indecent, and caused grave harm to many.” His sentencing in the state case is scheduled in August."

mov_AF44AAC8951AFEFF2A9BE3DA821E17ED,2025-06-27 08:07:22,en,WEB,"  People take photos of the new Louis Vuitton store in Shanghai By Casey Hall SHANGHAI (Reuters) -Louis Vuitton's latest Shanghai store is not your average luxury flagship. The 30-meter-high, ship-shaped store, ""The Louis"", is billed as an experience, and houses an exhibition space and cafe in Shanghai's downtown Nanjing Road shopping strip. ""The Louis"", which had a grand opening on Thursday, will undoubtedly draw crowds eager to post pictures to social media of its gleaming facade and the photo-ready exhibits inside. But LVMH-owned Louis Vuitton will also be hoping it can stimulate sales among Chinese consumers whose spending on luxury goods has slowed. LVMH's business strategy aligns with a broader shift among luxury goods retailers from a transactional model - where a shop merely sells goods to customers - to enticing customers with ""experiences"" that ultimately spur growth. The stakes are high for the luxury brands, which for years have relied on brisk sales in China to fuel their global growth, and ambitions, but are now facing a slowdown in demand in the world's second-biggest economy. The size of the Chinese market declined more than 18% last year to around 350 billion yuan ($48.80 billion) and sales are on track for a flat performance in 2025, according to estimates from consultancy Bain. Zino Helmlinger, head of China retail at real estate service provider CRBE, acknowledges that the luxury segment as a whole in China has taken ""a hit"" recently, though he believes the slowdown was expected. “If you look at the megastars - I mean LVMH, Kering, Richemont, Hermès - they almost tripled their profit within five years,"" he said. ""At some point, there is some counterbalancing, there is only so much you can grow, only so much you can generate."" In the first quarter, LVMH's revenue in the region that includes China fell 11% on an organic basis - the Asia-Pacific excluding Japan accounts for 30% of the group's total sales. Chinese consumers, hard hit by broader economic uncertainty and a prolonged property market downturn, have tightened spending on discretionary purchases - luxury branded handbags among them. Shanghai native Natalie Chen, 31, says she already owns enough ""stuff"" and has redirected a significant portion of the funds she once used for luxury goods to travel. ""Truthfully speaking, I don't feel that buying another bag will improve my life,"" she said, though she has already visited a new restaurant opened by Prada in Shanghai and intends to check out Louis Vuitton's new cafe concept with girlfriends. ""It brings a different kind of feeling than just [shopping] in a mall,"" Chen said, though she was unsure the ship-shaped store would lead her to make any purchases outside of coffee and cake. Still, the luxury brands are sensing a longer term opportunity to pump-prime sales. While appetite for personal luxury goods in China and around the world is declining, hurt by economic pressures and price fatigue, sales rates of ""experiential goods"" are rising, according to Bain, which highlighted a surge in personalized luxury hospitality experiences and rising fine dining sales in its spring luxury report. In 2024, for example, the overall personal luxury goods market worldwide fell 1% to 3% even as experiential luxury spending rose 5%, Bain said. LUXURY EVOLUTION New research released by real estate advisor Savills earlier this month points to this as a significant new trend in what it describes as China's ""evolving"" luxury market, in which people seeking out experiences are lured with more experiential luxury brand touchpoints, from restaurants to Salon Privé - private, appointment-only lounges for VIP shoppers. ""All the brands are closing stores, but those that can afford to are also opening big flagships or holding some big events or exhibitions to keep their visibility extremely high,"" said Patrice Nordey, CEO of Shanghai-based innovation consultancy Trajectry, essentially preparing for future success when the market picks up again. Brands from Balenciaga to Chanel, Louis Vuitton and Prada have all closed stores in China since the second-half of last year. Gucci is on track to close 10 stores in the market this year, Helmlinger said. Louis Vuitton's stablemate Dior opened a cafe concept in Chengdu earlier this year, and in March Prada opened a Wong Kar Wai-designed restaurant at its Rong Zhai cultural space in Shanghai. Jeweller Tiffany and Co. recently downsized a large downtown Shanghai store, but in March it also opened a new three-storey flagship in Chengdu. Nordey says that while more people refer to this trend as ""experiential"" retail, it actually speaks to something much deeper. ""I think it's a way of looking at your customer, either as someone that will buy products, or as an individual who is trying to have a more fulfilling life,"" he said. ""If your purpose is not only to feed your client with consumer products, but more than that, you might actually resonate more strongly with them."" While high-profile luxury store closures in mainland China have prompted speculation of brands lessening investment in a slowing market, CRBE's Helmlinger says the real story is more nuanced, indicating a strategic realignment of resources, rather than a pullback in the market. ""You need to create this concept of rarity, and rarity comes with scarcity,"" he said. ""When you have 80 or 90 stores in one market, it doesn't seem so rare anymore, it seems like it's mainstream.""

mov_B5D329281AE17CB17CF6A6392B4FAB4F,2025-06-27 08:19:13,en,WEB,"  On Thursday, June 25, following the premiere of SEVENTEEN's BuzzFeed Thirst Tweets interview, fans discussed BTS' Jin's recent appearance in another BuzzFeed interview. Many fans and netizens were surprised by SEVENTEEN's interview, as it's rare for K-pop idols and groups to appear on the show. As fans expressed this in the comments section of SEVENTEEN's BuzzFeed video, one of the employees at BuzzFeed responded to the same. The employee's comment stated that they have been aware of people requesting thirst tweet content with K-pop idols for years, and they explained that they always tend to pitch it to the artists. However, the artists usually turn down the offer and suggest that they will take part in another BuzzFeed interview where they play with puppies while answering questions. This naturally had netizens linking to the fact that BTS' Jin's Puppy Interview was released recently, and many fans speculated that BuzzFeed might've pitched him the thirst tweet interview, but he chose to film the Puppy Interview. One of the X accounts, @songofseokjin, also came forward to explain that they previously went viral in 2022 for requesting Jin's thirst tweet interview with BuzzFeed. They also reportedly requested the same interview in 2025 after the idol's solo career resumed. As fans and netizens drew comparisons to the two incidents, fans couldn't help but find it hilarious. They were also happy that the idol didn't accept the offer, as they expressed that the content might have been uncomfortable and awkward for Jin. Here are a few fan reactions on the same: More fans and netizens talked about how they would also be uncomfortable watching the idol read their thirst tweets. Following the idol's discharge from his mandatory military service, BTS' Jin soon restarted his activities in the industry. He held a Hug Event for 1000 ARMYs who were chosen through a Weverse raffle the very next day after his discharge to celebrate the group's 11th debut anniversary. In July 2024, the idol made history as the first Korean singer to be chosen as a Torchbearer at the Olympics. He represented South Korea for the 2024 Olympics Torch Relay. Following the same, he also kickstarted his own variety show, RUN JIN, which stands as a spin-off of BTS' RUN BTS variety show. The idol also bagged ambassadorship with luxury brands like Gucci and FRED. Around November of the same year, the idol put forth his first solo album, Happy, which held the track, Running Wild, as its title track. He also announced a solo world tour based on his variety show called RUN SEOKJIN EP TOUR, which is expected to start on June 28 at the Goyang Stadium in South Korea. Most recently, he released his second solo album, ECHO, on May 16, 2025. Therefore, fans and netizens have been eagerly awaiting more solo releases and content from the idol in the upcoming days."

The content delivery mechanism on the platform through an algorithm opens avenues of opportunity for businesses to reach colossal numbers of individuals organically, revolutionizing traditional forms of advertising and setting new benchmarks for actual brand interaction. Entertainment and Sports Brands Take the Lead Sporting goods brands and media companies have been extremely good at using the virality of TikTok. Nike is seen often in fitness do-it-yourself makeover clips, dance challenges, and sports achievement series seamlessly integrating their brands into user-generated material without feeling too corporate. The gaming sector has also taken notice of this potential, with sites such as MelBet positioning themselves strategically in sporting material and game discussion to reach interested clients which engagement-only participate in sports betting and casino gaming. Disney's strategy paves the way for advanced content strategy, having their brand portrayed in film reaction videos, theme park engagement, and vintage content outside demographic niches. The triumph of the entertainment business is because of the understanding that TikTok favors real storytelling over traditional marketing methods. Such brands know that coercive product placements tend to fail primarily, while natural inclusion in engaging stories increases engagement and conversion rates way beyond traditional marketing methods. Overwhelming Organic Integration: Technological Giants Apple, Samsung, and other tech companies have mastered the art of making an appearance on TikTok videos without explicitly advertising their products. Their products appear in innovative videos, tutorials, and lifestyle videos that rack up millions of impressions through sheer product placement that never feels artificial. Game studios are another group finding resounding success on the platform. Epic Games, Riot Games, and mobile game studios are staples in gameplay clips, reaction videos, and community challenges. Those staples habitually earn more engagement than typical ad campaigns through their utilization of the genuine excitement of gaming communities. The key to success for the tech sector is understanding that users of TikTok are watching for entertainment first, and for advertising messages second. It's successful technology brands that focus on enabling creativity rather than pushing sales messages, and this translates into higher engagement rates and greater brand affinity with younger viewers. Fashion and Beauty Brands Sweeping Viral Content The beauty and fashion industries have witnessed unprecedented growth through TikTok features, with Rare Beauty, Fenty Beauty, and Glossier emerging as household brands due to mostly viral videos and consumer reviews. These brands have excelled at product exposure rather than virtual user experience. Some of the reasons behind fashion and beauty brand success on TikTok are: Transformation Content: Fashion style and makeup tips vlogs merely demonstrate products in a way that truly creates value for a viewer User-Generated Reviews: Real product reviews and “get ready with me” vlogs build trust and influence purchasing more than traditional advertising does Participation in Trends: Fashion brands that rapidly respond to emerging trends and challenges stay in the game and current in the platform's high-speed culture Influencer Collaborations: Strategic influencer partnerships involving macro and micro-influencers enable reach extension with preservation of authenticity The specific value of the beauty market on TikTok is the visual format of its content. Transformative videos, before-and-after, and tutorial content all lend themselves easily to demonstrations of products and thus offer strong incentives for viewers to watch and share branded content. These brands have also been beautifully in tune with trending sounds, hashtags, and cultural happenings, remaining current in content within the ever-changing world of TikTok. Food and Beverage Industry's Viral Recipe Revolution Quick-serve restaurants and beverage brands are finding recipe videos, hacks, and taste tests generating incredible action on TikTok. Starbucks, Chipotle, and other energy drink manufacturers continue to crop up in user-generated content, as consumers feature innovative ways of using the brands. The success in the food industry shows the strength of functional content that delivers value to consumers instantaneously. Recipe modifications, secret menus, and cooking tips become irresistible motivations for consumers to use brand content while, at the same time, driving traffic and revenue.

mov_2D73A593297CA4BE7474768C0FC8586F,2025-06-27 11:30:31,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Diese Nachricht sorgt für Aufsehen in der Modewelt: Anna Wintour (75) tritt nach 37 Jahren als Chefredakteurin der amerikanischen ""Vogue"" zurück. Condé Nast als Verlag des Magazins bestätigte die Nachricht dem Sender CNN. Wintour, die seit 1988 als Nachfolgerin von Grace Mirabella (1929-2021) an der Spitze des einflussreichsten Modemagazins der Welt steht, wird jedoch nicht in Rente gehen. Sie behält ihre Position als Global Chief Content Officer bei Condé Nast und bleibt zudem globale Redaktionsdirektorin (Global Editorial Director) der ""Vogue"". So sorgte Anna Wintour von Beginn an für Aufsehen Als Wintour die Nachfolge von Grace Mirabella antrat, ahnte zunächst wohl niemand, dass aus dieser Personalentscheidung eine der längsten und prägendsten Führungsperioden in der Geschichte des Modemagazinjournalismus werden würde. Doch bereits mit dem Cover ihrer ersten Ausgabe aus dem November 1988 sorgte Wintour für Aufmerksamkeit. Das Titelbild zeigte Model Michaela Bercu (55) in einem Christian-Lacroix-Oberteil im Wert von 10.000 Dollar und einer 50-Dollar-Jeans von Guess. Es war das erste Mal, dass eine Jeans auf der Titelseite des Magazins erschien. Wintour selbst sagte 2012 dazu, das Bild sei ""so anders"" gewesen als die eleganten Nahaufnahmen, die damals typisch für die ""Vogue""-Cover gewesen seien, mit viel Make-up und großem Schmuck. ""Dieses Bild brach alle Regeln"", so die 75-Jährige. Es habe anschließend ""alle möglichen Interpretationen"" des Covers gegeben: ""Aber nichts von alledem war wahr. Ich hatte mir das Bild nur angesehen und den Wind der Veränderung gespürt. Und mehr kann man von einem Titelbild nicht verlangen."" Promis auf dem ""Vogue""-Cover sorgen für Gesprächsstoff Es folgten einige weitere ""Vogue""-Titelbilder, die für Gesprächsstoff sorgten. Auch weil Wintour nicht nur Models, sondern ebenso Prominente auf die Titelseite des Magazins brachte. So hob sie zum Beispiel 2009 die damalige First Lady Michelle Obama (61) auf den Titel. Das ""Vogue""-Cover festigte Obamas Status als Stilikone und Vorbild für amerikanische Frauen. Kontroversen löste dagegen Wintours Entscheidung aus, 2014 Kim Kardashian (44) und Kanye West (48) gemeinsam auf dem Titelbild zu zeigen. Viele Fans des Magazins waren der Meinung, dass die beiden dort fehl am Platz seien. Wintour verteidigte die Entscheidung mit der Begründung, das Cover spiegele den bedeutenden Einfluss des Paares wider. Ein weiteres viel beachtetes Cover der US-""Vogue"" gab es im Jahr 2022. Sängerin Rihanna (37) präsentierte stolz ihren Babybauch in einem enganliegenden, roten, spitzenbesetzten Bodysuit. Im Dezember 2020 war außerdem Harry Styles (31) als erster Mann alleine auf einem amerikanischen ""Vogue""-Cover zu sehen gewesen - in einem Kleid von Gucci. Anna Wintour ist selbst eine Ikone Auch abseits des Magazins hinterlässt Anna Wintour Spuren. Sie ist seit den 1990er Jahren Vorsitzende des Veranstaltungskomitees der Met Gala, die auch oft als ""Mode-Oscar"" bezeichnet wird. Bei dem Charity-Event kommen jedes Jahr in New York große Stars zusammen, die angeblich Wintour selbst auswählt. Auch Wintours typischer Bob mit Pony und ihre große Sonnenbrille sind in der Popkultur zu einer festen Größe geworden. Weitere Prominenz brachte ihr ein, dass sie als Inspiration für die Figur der Miranda Priestly, gespielt von Meryl Streep (76), in dem Film ""Der Teufel trägt Prada"" gesehen wird. Wintours Ruf als anspruchsvolle und schwierige Chefin wurde schon in den 1970er Jahren begründet."

mov_F81C2DA6034A54B0E1A3FF05C8506DBE,2025-06-27 16:53:20,en,WEB,"  The press tour is over. Materialists is out. The verdict is in: There's just something special about Dakota Johnson. She's a nepo baby with a Hollywood pedigree that, on paper, should make her seem unapproachable. Her parents are stars Melanie Griffith and Don Johnson, and her grandmother is Tippi Hedren. Her first leading role? Anastasia Steele in Fifty Shades of Grey, a movie franchise that could have typecast her into oblivion. But somehow, Dakota Johnson has taken everything that might have worked against her and turned it into her superpower. Just like in Materialists, she's technically one-third of a love triangle alongside internet boyfriends Chris Evans and Pedro Pascal — but in every interview, whether solo or alongside her costars, it's clear: she's the one stealing the show. Johnson didn't just promote a movie — she reminded us why she's one of the most magnetic, self-aware stars working today. Her media blitz for the film showed us the actress at her most charming: effortlessly chic, disarmingly unfiltered and entirely in control of the narrative. Dakota Johnson and Chris Evans at the Materialists premiere. (Arturo Holmes/) Materialists marked Johnson's first big press tour since 2024's Madame   fiasco, the superhero flop that could've ended most stars' careers. Johnson proved once again she's not afraid to get in on the joke. Instead of hiding from the bomb, she met the criticism head-on and didn't shy away from discussing it this time around. It really was a master class in turning chaos into a cool, controlled comeback, with really good outfits. From the outside, Johnson's Materialists rollout looked like the usual checklist: a few late-night appearances with funny and relatable anecdotes, a podcast or two, fashion blogs buzzing over every cool girl outfit and dinner with high-profile friends like Taylor Swift. But what set it apart was Johnson's authenticity. There were no obviously rehearsed talking points, no damage control and definitely no over-explaining. The latter applied to her personal life too. The more she leaned into the unpredictability — showing up a little cheeky and extremely herself — the more fans (and fashion blogs and internet stan accounts) leaned in. Whether she was kissing a cardboard cutout of Pedro Pascal's face on the red carpet at the film's premiere, dropping a casual curse on live TV or flawlessly eating hot wings in a suede jacket worth more than most people's rent, this wasn't just a press tour — it was performance art. And Johnson nailed every scene. Here's how she pulled it off — with sharp humor, sharp style and a complete command of the spotlight. She's always in on the joke — especially when she's the punchline Need proof? Just watch what happened when she strolled onto The Tonight Show on June 3 in a plunging Ferragamo blazer, mini skirt and zero panic. Johnson joked to host Jimmy Fallon that it was the “wrong outfit” for the occasion. “My eyes are up here,” she told him. Fallon handed her a tissue in a mock attempt to help cover up her cleavage, which she gamely wore, and teased that he was going to sell it on eBay after the show. [embedded content] Johnson knew what she was there to do — she had a film to promote, after all — so once the wardrobe discussion was out of the way, she went on to share funny anecdotes about her relationship with her Materialists costar Pascal, who himself has charmed the masses with his endearing interviews, offbeat sense of humor and disarming humility. Fallon showed the audience a photo of the two of them together at a 2024 Stevie Nicks concert in London, and Johnson said Pascal was wearing her sweater. More in Celebrity ""He does that a lot; he takes my clothes,"" she said. “He's always underdressed … I mean, he's wearing a T-shirt and it's cold outside. Not like he forgot his pants.” And with that deadpan nod to her ensemble, the audience ate it up. Days later, over on Late Night with Seth Meyers, she once again opened with a line about her not wearing pants. The girl is committed to her bit! She brought her signature dry humor to a conversation about baseball, or rather, her lack of knowledge about it, while cheekily explaining the custom Mets jersey she wore to a game that read “DJ 69.” It's not just limited to late night, either. In the early hours of the Today show with costar Chris Evans, he kept it safe, whereas she went for it. When asked by Craig Melvin what a nonnegotiable quality in a partner was, Evans said, “Must love dogs.” But not Johnson. When prompted for her response, she calmly said, “Not an asshole.” The host scrambled, asking producers to “clean that up for the West Coast.” Johnson sat there, unbothered. Johnson's Hot Ones appearance was no different...."

A lifelong fan of Formula One, Day grew up going to races with his father, who sponsored F1 cars and was the first person in the U.K. to make replica white metal diecast models of racing cars. The epic rivalries of the sport have always appealed to him, like between James Hunt and Niki Lauda, who were the focus of the 2013 movie “Rush,” which Day did costumes for. So Apple's new summer blockbuster, “F1: The Movie,” starring Brad Pitt, Javier Bardem, Damson Idris and Kerry Condon, was a rather easy sell. Plus: “who turns down the chance to work with Brad Pitt?” Day says. Known for his work in “Bohemian Rhapsody” and “Rocketman,” Day found the project somewhat easier to start given the canvas that the real-life world of Formula One provides. “It is a very classic look in Formula One and there's a real uniform that the general public wear: it's very classy, it's chinos, it's very tight jeans, it's white trainers, polo shirts, blues, pinks,” Day says. He also was guided by director Joseph Kosinski's penchance for modern, cool-looking films that stand the test of time. “Those garages look almost like something from 'Star Wars.' They're incredible,” Day says of the F1 garages. “And that's what he wanted to do with the costumes as well: create something with a very contemporary, but long-lasting feel to it. It spiraled into the idea of this very fashionable world. I wanted to think about the idea that when you watch this movie in 10, 20, 30, 40 years, it still looks contemporary. It still looks real. Nothing will date about it because the clothes are the clothes. Unless we start wearing spacesuits in 50 years' time — even then, the pit crew will look fine.” Pitt stars as Sonny Hayes, a onetime star F1 driver who lives in a camper van and is pulled out of retirement to save an ailing British F1 team. Hayes may live off the grid, but this is still Brad Pitt, and the character naturally looks exceptionally cool throughout. “He was amazing to dress. He loves clothes,” Day says. “Sonny is a cowboy, he's a maverick, he's a gambler, he's a chancer. And I think we felt that we wanted to harken back to the days of the '70s where heroes were heroes. The people in the movies in the '70s had an edge, they weren't as clean cut as people [are today],” Day adds. “So I looked at people like Kris Kristofferson, Steve McQueen, Paul Newman, [Clint] Eastwood.” Day calls out the scene where Sonny first arrives back into the world of F1, at Silverstone, and is wearing double denim with a pair of Italian-made cowboy boots. More in Style “It's harping back to the old days, but also using very contemporary clothing,” Day explains. “We used '60s original Levi jeans, Wrangler shirts, a contemporary Loro Piana jacket. And I used a great British brand called t, which has very classic, beautiful sweatshirts. So there was the use of vintage clothing, but also contemporary clothing that looked vintage.” At the start of production, Day and his team set up a shop across three suites in a hotel filled with racks of sweatshirts, jeans, shoes, sunglasses and socks, and Pitt brought some of his own items as well. “We set this shop up, he brought his stuff, and we just went through a whole bunch of it, took the whole day. We tried everything on, photographed it, and he had the photographs and was like, 'well, I like that. That works,'” Day says. Day showed Pitt a pair of orange aviator-style sunglasses that had belonged to his father, now deceased, and Pitt fell in love with them and wears them in the film — “it's a real tribute to my dad being involved in the industry,” Day says. One of the most important parts of the wardrobe was the socks: Day and his wife, Shaida, who is an associate designer, found a Japanese brand called Rototo that Pitt fell in love with. “We bought so many socks, and socks would get spirited away — I have no idea where they went. I think Brad's suitcases must have been quite full of socks,” Day jokes. Idris, meanwhile, plays the young new hotshot driver, Joshua Pearce, who wears more youthful streetwear clothes. Day sought inspiration for the costumes from the sport's fashion leader, Lewis Hamilton. “Lewis is an amazing champion of fashion. It's not just the big brands that he champions, he champions small brands, quirky brands,” Day says. He translated that into a mix of more established British brands like Wales Bonner as well as smaller brands like Sage Nation and YMC for Idris. Bardem needed to look polished as the team's owner. Day took Bardem, naturally a more casual dresser he says, to Zegna, Tom Ford and Gucci to fit him for tonal suits with simple dress shoes. “Javier is a very charming man, great to dress,” Day says. “It's probably the best looking male cast I've ever had, and some of the best dressed men I've ever had to dress.” It didn't hurt that the film came with a rather comfortable costume budget. “I have to admit, it's lovely going out and spending thousands and thousands and thousands of dollars of not your own money on people who are getting clothes,” Day says...."
tw_sl_c9a5dd56c0f6a16f716df6bdf2c1c232,2025-06-27 17:11:16,en,WEB,"  Some of the biggest names in Hollywood have jetted out to Venice this week to celebrate the severely swanky wedding of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos and his fiancée, Lauren Sanchez. The billionaire businessman, 61, and the former journalist, 55, went public with their relationship in 2019, and announced their engagement in 2023, after four years of dating. Details have remained under wraps over their nuptials but plans haven't gone down well with locals who have launched protests – hanging banners, stickers, posters and signs around the area condemning the celebrations. Kim Kardashian and momager Kris Jenner have made the journey to Italy, having celebrated the bride's hen do in Paris last month. Orlando Bloom, Leonardo DiCaprio and Bill Gates have also been spotted in the area. As the couple prepare to walk down the aisle, here are the biggest names hitting the streets of Venice, their net worths and how they amassed their fortunes. Who is going to Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez's wedding? Although a full, finalized guest list has not been shared, the outlet reports that a string of famous faces received invites to support the happy couple on their big day. Around 200 people were personally invited, with Brides.com suggesting that they were spending roughly $50,000 per person – racking up a rumored $10million bill. Kim Kardashian – $1.7billion It's hard to remember a time when Kim Kardashian and her family weren't across billboards, magazine covers, catwalks and our TVs and phone screens. The Kardashians shot to superstardom thanks to their popular reality series, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, in 2007 and have barely looked back – with their current show, the Kardashians, breaking records on Hulu. The budding lawyer, who shares children North, Saint, Chicago and Psalm with ex-husband Kanye West, used her fame to set up a string of businesses including cosmetics brand, KKW. In 2019, she founded shapewear company Skims, which has been wildly successful – and launched collaborations withFendi, the NBA, the WNBA and Dolce & Gabbana. Khloe Kardashian – $60 million Khloe followed in her sister's footsteps by getting into the fashion industry by launching denim brand Good American alongside Emma Grede in 2016. The mom-of-two recently introduced protein popcorn company Khloud, and podcast Khloe in Wonder Land, while also serving as an executive producer on the Kardashians. Kylie Jenner – $670 million Kylie Jenner may not have an EP title on the Kardashians but that hasn't stopped her from making serious money alongside her famous family, having starred on their shows from the young age of nine years old. At 18, she stepped into the business world by launching Kylie Lip Kits in 2015, and eventually sold a 51% stake to Coty of $600m in 2019. Last year, the reality star – who shares two children with rapper Travis Scott – joined Kim and Khloe in the fashion world by introducing clothing line Khy, as well as canned cocktail drink Sprinter. Kris Jenner – $200 million There's a reason that fans regularly use the phrase, 'The devil works hard but Kris Jenner works harder'. The momager is the mastermind behind the huge success of her family. Not only does she serve as the manager for her six children, but she also gets a percentage of their deals, has a starring role – and EP credit – in the Kardashians – all while sipping on martinis. Kendall Jenner – $60 million Kendall Jenner's rise to becoming America's biggest supermodel was captured by cameras on KUWTK, meaning viewers got to go on the ride from her first ever catwalk and photoshoot as a teenager– to being named the highest paid model in the world. She has posed in designs for Marc Jacobs, Chanel, Gucci, Vera Wang, Versace and countless others over the years, and graced the cover of fashion magazines all over the world, including Vogue, LOVE, W, Vanity Fair and Harper's Bazaar. Kendall collaborated on her sister's brands, before launching her own company, 818 Tequila, in 2021. Orlando Bloom – $40million Orlando Bloom shot to superstardom thanks to his role as Legolas in the Lord of the Rings trilogy, in 2001, and has gone on to lead the way in huge movies ever since – including the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise and Gran Turismo. His most recent role came as Marlon in Amazon Prime Video hit, Deep Cover, which was released this month. He is rumored to have split from fiancée Katy Perry shortly before the nuptials, and is attending the ceremony solo as the singer is currently on tour in Australia. Tom Brady – $530million (in 2023) Tom Brady has gone down as a sporting legend after spending 23 years playing in the NFL – and is regarded as the best quarterback of all time. He won seven Super Bowl championships in his career – including six with the New England Patriots, where he played for 20 seasons before moving to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in 2020, and remained there until his retirement in 2023. The athlete is father to three children – welcoming son Jack with ex-girlfriend Bridget Moynahan, he also shares Benjamin and Vivian with ex-wife Gisele Bundchen. Oprah Winfrey – $3.1 billion Oprah has been a staple of the Forbes rich list for years, and is currently 13th on the charts of America's richest self-made women. As a talk show host, she has secured huge interviews with Michael Jackson, Meghan Markle, Tom Cruise, Barack Obama and many more. After helming her series for 25 years, she turned her brand into a huge media empire – launching her cable channel OWN and serving as the CEO and chairwoman of Harpo Productions, working on Selma, the Water Man and the Color Purple among others. Gayle King – $80million Acclaimed journalist Gayle King has been in the spotlight for decades, and began her career as a news anchor in the 80s, before appearing as a special correspondent on the Oprah Winfrey Show with her best friend. She went on to land her own talk show and, in 2011, moved over to CBS to anchor CBS Mornings. Gayle may have a closer relationship to the couple than most, having traveled to space with the bride earlier this year. Ivanka Trump – $50million The former model is President Donald Trump's eldest daughter and regularly appears alongside her father for public events. During his first term, she joined the White House as a senior adviser, having previously served as an executive vice president at the Trump Organization. She married husband Jared Kushner in 2009 after two years of dating, and they share children Arabella, Joseph and Theodore together. Jared Kushner – 'At least $900million'..."

mov_E2E586337E40D860A20A92D2CAF4D054,2025-06-27 17:15:10,en,WEB,"  PARIS -Parvus Asset Management, a hedge fund registered in Britain, has raised its stake in Kering, a filing by France's financial regulator showed on Friday, now holding around 5% of the group's share capital. The filing comes as Kering is under increased market pressure, with shares down by over 60% in the past two years after a string of profit warnings and designer changes at its Italian flagship label Gucci. Dealing with the London-based fund known for its activist approach adds to the list of challenges of incoming chief executive Luca de Meo, who will take over the helm in September. Kering declined to comment, while Parvus did not immediately reply to a request for comment. The hedge fund has declared that it breached the regulatory threshold of 5% of Kering's share capital, and 3.5% of its voting rights, on Friday, the filing by France's AMF regulator said. It was previously cited as a shareholder with a 4% equity stake and 2.9% of voting rights in Kering's last annual report. The firm, which earlier targeted budget airline Ryanair and Italian bank UniCredit, has recently also built up a stake in Danish drugmaker Novo Nordisk, the Financial Times reported earlier this month.

With his frequent easy smiles, cherubic head of golden curls, and disarming Australian accent, it's hard to think of Zada as a tormented soul, but it's a role he delivers time and time again. Earlier this year, Zada appeared in his first major role as Charlie, a gay teenager struggling with his small hometown's scorn after being outed, in the Australian series Invisible Boys. He just wrapped filming for Netflix's limited series East of Eden, in which he wrestles with universal questions of good and evil as the tormented Cal Trask alongside Florence Pugh, Christopher Abbott, and Mike Faist. He is now Johnny Sinclair Dennis in We Were Liars, the Amazon Prime drama based on E. Lockhart's eponymous novel about the Sinclair's, an extremely wealthy but incredibly warped family chasing after their patriarch's near-unattainable favor. At first, easy to write off as a too-rich teen wrapped up in the blissful ignorance and arrogance of privilege, Zada masterfully peels back Johnny's layers to reveal a complex, frustrated, and empathetic boy buckling under the pressure of a family that is forever striving for utter perfection. LOUIS VUITTON MEN'S jacket, shirt, pants, and shoes. Zada doesn't consider himself a “self-proclaimed rich asshole” himself—and if his boyish authenticity and propensity to throw up peace signs are anything to go by, he's not—but he felt that he knew who Johnny was from the first time he read his scenes. “It's a hard one to explain, except I just felt like I knew how everyone else was seeing him on paper, but I knew how he would be feeling. I was trying to not think of him as an asshole and just somebody who's grown up in that environment, and just doesn't understand what's going on around him,” says Zada. “Being able to find that throughout the series was joyful.” Despite a budding acting legacy as a suffering soul, that's not who Zada is—he says he's “really happy, actually” —and it's certainly not their misery that attracts him to these characters. “I just see them as interesting characters. I'm interested in playing something else. But apparently I'm just good at the tortured boy thing, and that's just what people want to see,” quips Zada. LOEWE jacket and top. Good-natured and unfailingly earnest, Zada isn't at all like the tormented boy popping up on the screen in project after project. Before turning to acting at the age of 15, he wanted to be a footballer—“soccer player,” he generously clarifies for his American audience—and routinely got up at two in the morning to watch the Arsenal Football Club's games. Although both of his parents are in the industry—his father is an actor and director and his mother is a producer—he didn't always dream of the silver screen. It was only after helping his older brother Hal, who is also an actor, with self-tapes that a love of acting was sparked in him. His other interests are relatively simple: watching movies, reading books, swimming and surfing, and spending time with his family, including his four siblings. “And that's kind of about it,” he shrugs, as if he were just anyone else. And maybe he does still feel like any other teenager, but there's no denying that Joseph Zada is on the brink of something exciting. It's a reality that has become inescapable for him to confront, especially when, on the day of We Were Liars' release, Zada caught sight of himself in an ad for the show plastered on a London bus. DOLCE & GABBANA top and pants. “I was just walking down the street with my brother, and I had no idea. No one had prepped me, and my face just comes by, a big version of my face,” he says. “It's so surreal.” Circumstances are rapidly changing for the young actor, but Zada's still maintaining some semblance of balance between putting in the work and not taking himself too seriously, even as the rest of the world begins to. When Johnny Sinclair coolly hops off a police boat at the dock of his family's estate and saunters onto screen in We Were Liars, his cousin Cadence Sinclair, played by Emily Alyn Lind, describes him as “salt, swagger, and reckless abandon.” With a sly grin, Zada delivers his own set of descriptors: “extremely talented, extremely chill, and extremely humble.” It's all said in jest, but it's not untrue. Extremely talented? With several solid roles already under his belt and more on the horizon, that one can be safely checked off the list. Extremely chill? If his attitude towards the pressures of the industry—“You've just got to roll with it,” he says—is anything to go by, then check again! Extremely humble? While that last one was chock full of wry self-deprecation—courtesy of his ever present charm—it's another check. Even at his young age, Zada has an uncommonly zen mentality akin to that of a seasoned industry professional. PRADA shirt. “I've said this a lot, but I do just feel like I'm still learning. I think it's a lot of pressure, but I'm just constantly reminding myself that I'm still learning and not to be afraid of whether it's good or not,” Zada says. “Unfortunately, I'm just learning on a pretty big stage where there is a lot of noise, but I try to block it all out and stay in my own lane.” Turning a blind eye to the pandemonium may prove difficult, as anticipation ramps up for the upcoming movie adaption of Suzanne Collins' Sunrise on the Reaping. When filming begins, Zada will take on the challenge of bringing the young version of Woody Harrelson's Haymitch Abernathy to life as he battles for survival in a poisonously beautiful arena. With the addition of several Hollywood titans to the cast—Ralph Fiennes, Kieran Culkin, Billy Porter, and Glenn Close, to name a few—and a vast and dedicated fan base already foaming at the mouth for the movie's release, Zada is aware that life is going to change drastically for him.

mov_DE002FD59F156A8868C997C98601D7FE,2025-06-27 18:42:14,en,WEB,"  LONDON — Jannik Sinner is the man of the hour. The Italian tennis player ranks as the world number one on the ATP tennis list and to celebrate competing in his fifth consecutive Wimbledon Championships, he threw an intimate cocktail party and dinner at Claridge's in London. As the city hushed down for the weekend, with many heading to the Glastonbury Festival, Sinner drew in a starry crowd including Paul Mescal, Erin Doherty, Fionn O'Shea, Joe Keery, Naomi Ackie and George MacKay. The tennis star swapped his Wimbledon whites for an olive green Gucci ensemble. “I feel very privileged and honored to be an ambassador of such a prestigious Italian brand known for its class, elegance and innovation,” said Sinner. “Thanks to my partnership with Gucci, I'm starting to get to know the world of fashion and all the hard work behind the beautiful products we see on the catwalk and in the stores.” The tennis player has been spending some time in London training ahead of his first match on Monday against Luca Nardi. The British summer may be very well on its way, but it was a school night for many of the guests, who confessed to a jam-packed schedule. Irish actor Fionn O'Shea, with freshly dyed blond hair, said he was sneaking off to Glastonbury for the first time before diving into work. He's in the midst of shooting “The Queen of Fashion,” a biopic on the life of iconic fashion editor Isabella Blow that will wrap up at the end of summer. More in Celebrity The actor will be playing Irish milliner Philip Treacy in the film, directed and written by Alex Marx. “It's been really great so far and I've got to spend so much time with Philip, which is so rare. Philip and I have been making hats together, which has been one of the most special experiences of my life,” said O'Shea. “He's been making the hats and I've been watching mostly. Philip is a genius. He's so talented, creative and passionate. It's been a real honor getting to spend that time in his studio to watch him work. He will say that I made more of the hats than I did, because he's very humble and kind,” he added. O'Shea has been dabbling in the world of biographies. His next project set to come out later this year is Netflix's “House of Guinness,” based on the family behind the Guinness brewing company. In portraying real people on the screen, it has meant transforming from one role to another. “This is my first time going to something with my hair being a different color. Myself and my stylist Felicity Kay chose this look together. I just thought the clothes were so beautiful and I felt confident in them, also the coloring is really good, which is always nice,” he said of his brown trousers and black polo shirt. British actor Erin Doherty will also be spending her summer vacation on set. She's going to be starring in “California Avenue” opposite Helena Bonham Carter and Bill Nighy about complex family dynamics. “Preparing for a role is my favorite part of the job. I love people and getting a book that I can tuck into. The series is loosely based on the director and writer Hugo Blick's life, which is great because I get to pick his brain about it,” she said. Even though Doherty will be missing out on summer plans, she expects to take an early Christmas break. The actor is no stranger to fashion. She played a young Princess Anne in Netflix's “The Crown.” “I love playing with fashion. It's such a playful opportunity to just let your creative side run wild and for me, what I wear changes on a daily basis. I had a cruise in the Gucci store and picked something that has a nod to going out, but it's also a little understated,” said Doherty. As of next week, the Gucci store on New Bond Street will be taken over by the brand's tennis line, which includes a collaboration with the American tennis racket brand Head. Let the games begin, in store and on court at Wimbledon. Launch Gallery: Paul Mescal, Naomi Ackie, and More at the Gucci Dinner Co-Hosted by Jannik Sinner"

mov_149AB91B16A3BF768A548F30E14B15A5,2025-06-27 20:54:57,en,WEB,"  From tech billionaires to royalty, this guest list outpaces the economies of 29 U.S. states. Venice is suffering through an all-out billionaire invasion as Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez prepare to tie the knot in the floating city. Among the arrivals: media tycoons, tech titans, Hollywood elites, and royals—collectively worth close to half a trillion dollars, or the equivalent of Nevada and New Hampshire's GDP combined. Here's a look at who's descending on Venice—and just how rich this guest list really is. Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sánchez: $226.7 Billion The Amazon founder, 61, and his TV-anchor-turned-Hollywood fiancée, 55, are throwing the “wedding of the century,” shelling out over $50 million for the affair—nearly double Sánchez's $30 million net worth. Amid local protests accusing them of turning Venice into a “playground for oligarchs,” the couple welcomed some 200 A-list guests to their celebration, many who arrived this week by private yacht while others clogged Marco Polo airport with private jets. Bezos also invited President Donald Trump, but despite the president's affinity for billionaires and gilded spectacles, he declined, citing scheduling conflicts. Bill Gates: $116.5 Billion The Microsoft co-founder, 69, touched down in his private jet on Thursday and later attended the wedding's welcome party alongside his girlfriend, Paula Hurd—the widow of Oracle CEO Mark Hurd. The couple previously attended Bezos and Sanchez's engagement party aboard the Blue Origin founder's $500 million superyacht, the 417-foot-long “Koru,” in 2023. Lachlan Murdoch: $2.1 Billion One of several media tycoons to show up for the wedding, Lachlan Murdoch, 53, is the son of 94-year-old publishing magnate Rupert Murdoch and the heir to the family's multibillion-dollar media empire. He arrived in Venice with his wife Sarah. The Kardashians: $2.6 Billion Kim Kardashian, 44, tops the clan's net worth list at $1.7 billion, followed by Kylie Jenner, 27, at $670 million. The Kardashians—close friends with Sanchez—have built their fortunes through business ventures launched off the back of their reality-TV fame. Kim and Kylie are accompanied by their poorer sisters Khloé Kardashian and Kendall Jenner, and momager Kris Jenner, 69, who brought boyfriend Corey Gamble for the gondola ride. Francois-Henri Pinault: $18.8 Billion Francois-Henri Pinault, 63, heir to the Pinault family's massive fortune, is the head of luxury group Kering, which owns brands such as Yves Saint Laurent, Gucci, and Balenciaga. He was spotted without his wife, actress Salma Hayek. Barry Diller and Diane von Fürstenberg: $5.2 Billion Barry Diller, another media mogul, is the chairman of IAC (a co-owner of the Daily Beast) and is attending the festivities with his wife, fashion designer Diane von Fürstenberg. The couple, 83 and 78, are longterm friends of Bezos and Sánchez, and their yacht is said to have inspired the design of Bezo's Koru. Oprah Winfrey: $3.1 Billion The world's richest talk-show host, 71, was pictured boarding a boat after her private jet landed in Venice on Thursday. Oprah Winfrey was accompanied by her best friend, CBS Mornings anchor Gayle King, 70, who took part in Sánchez's 11-minute trip to the edge of space aboard the Blue Origin rocket in April. King and Sanchez declared themselves astronauts; the official definition does not agree. Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana: $4.5 Billion Rumor has it Sánchez chose Dolce & Gabbana for her wedding gown—so, naturally, the men behind the legendary fashion house made the trip to Venice. Like many other guests, Domenico Dolce, 66, and Stefano Gabbana, 62, are staying at five-star hotels situated directly on the Grand Canal, like the Aman and the Gritti Palace. John Elkann: $2.8 Billion John Elkann, 49, (left) is the head of the Agnelli family—a multi-industry business dynasty built by his great-great-grandfather, Fiat founder Giovanni Agnelli. In addition to chairing automaker Stellantis, which makes Dodge and Jeep in the U.S., Elkann is the CEO of Exor, a holding company with controlling stakes in Ferrari, The Economist, and Fiat. He is accompanied by wife Lavinia Borromeo (right). Ari Emanuel: $1 Billion One of Hollywood's most powerful—and wealthiest—talent agents, Emanuel, 64, is linked to Sánchez and Bezos through his agency, Endeavor. He also serves as chairman and CEO of media conglomerate TKO Holdings Group, which owns both the Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC) and World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE). Emanuel was the real-life inspiration for Ari Gold on the HBO series Entourage. Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner: $840 Million Although her father skipped the occasion, Ivanka Trump, 43, made the trip across the Atlantic with her husband Jared Kushner, 44—who may soon crack the billionaire ranks through his investment firm Affinity Partner—and their three kids. “Ready to celebrate the love story of our friends,” Ivanka posted on X. Queen Rania of Jordan: $35 Million Rania, 54, has reportedly maintained a close friendship with Bezos and Sánchez ever since Bezos first visited her and her husband, King Abdullah II, 63, at Jordan's royal palace in 2016. She was joined in Venice by her son, Crown Prince Hussein, his wife, Princess Rajwa, and their newborn daughter."

mov_9E81580FA7C4EFA3CD3190D225089DE7,2025-06-28 04:01:42,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]Non importa che data segni il calendario, non può ufficialmente definirsi estate fino a che per le strade delle città non iniziano a sorgere qua e là espadrillas a profusione. Emblema calzabile del guardaroba capsula della calda stagione, le iconiche scarpe in corda tornano puntuali ad essere le protagoniste assolute dell'estate 2025 ai piedi delle più rigorose fashionista. Espadrillas, quali aggiungere subito alla tua wishlist per l'estate 2025: 5 modelli da non perdere Dal nord della Spagna e le coste francesi dal 1927 conquistano di anno in anno i cuori di tutta Europa da tempo immemorabile: classico intramontabile a caratterizzare la moda della warm season, le mitiche espadrillas si riconfermano per l'estate appena iniziata le predilette tra i sandali di tendenza da indossare con disinvoltura dal centro città al mare. Questa volta le arcinote calzature spagnole, riconoscibili per la loro suola in corda intrecciata e l'aura casual ma chic al contempo, sono tornate tra noi in sembianze del tutto inedite: da sempre tra le favorite di celebrities e comuni mortali, si abbinano perfettamente alla schiera di lunghi abiti e gonne midi a regnare sovrane sul panorama moda del momento. Dalla propria hanno un'invidiabile quantitativo di versatilità: stanno bene quasi con tutto, e si portano con estrema facilità dal mattino sino a tarda sera. Comode e sfiziose, esplorano per la stagione in corso le silhouette più disparate spaziando dalla amatissima categoria delle flat shoes a quella dedicata alle più vertiginose zeppe, grande must-have del periodo. Sul loro conto crediamo di sapere oramai tutto, eppure la loro origine è avvolta da un fitto alone di mistero: se è vero che Francia e Spagna ne hanno a lungo rivendicato la paternità, i primissimi indizi storici sono stati rilevati nei Paesi Baschi. Il nome di questa specifica scarpa deriva infatti dal catalano espardenya, altrettanto specifico termine ad indicare calzature confezionate in sparto (espart), una pianta mediterranea intrecciata generalmente impiegata nella realizzazione di suole flessibili ma resistenti. Dapprima indossate esclusivamente da pescatori e contadini, oggi possiamo dirlo: ne hanno fatta di strada. Odierno simbolo di un'eleganza chic ma libera, incarnazione impeccabile del mix ben bilanciato tra mood bohémien e gusto ricercato, le prime espadrillas sono state lanciate dal brand Castañer, nel lontano 1927, in versione flat. A renderle indimenticabili ci hanno pensato il prezioso contributo di icone storiche quali Salvador Dalí e Marilyn Monroe ma soprattutto la leggendaria collaborazione con Yves Saint Laurent, negli anni Settanta, epoca in cui fu concepita la zeppa in corda che noi tutti ora siamo felici di rincontrare ogni estate. È chiaro, parliamo di una tipologia di calzatura che ha una storia lunghissima alle sue spalle e che, forse proprio per questo, sembra destinata a non sfiorire mai, complice il suo fascino condensato dall'irresistibile spore retrò. Non necessariamente, però, è detto che manchino le novità: i modelli attualmente in auge esplorano texture e materiali innovativi, offrendo alla schiera di fashion addicted in fermento inattese alternative in denim ed in pelle, ma anche romanticissime evoluzioni crochet o arricchite con elementi gioiello e metallici. In versione ballerina, mules o sandalo, i dettami della moda odierna ce le hanno raccontate in passerella davvero in tutte le salse. Pronte a scoprire la selezione definitiva di espadrillas da avere per l'estate 2025? Espadrillas lavorate e gioiello, per brillare sul bagnasciuga Come un autentico gioiello per piedi, le espadrillas dell'estate 2025 hanno assunto un'aura preziosa: in pelle color crema, le espadrillas di Valentino Garavani in passerella erano ad esempio rese uniche dall'applicazione di borchie oro a decorarne il bordo, accanto ad una fascia ricamata nei toni del blu nella parte anteriore. Vicino a cristalli e brillanti in pedana non sono passate inosservate, però, e come avrebbero potuto, le versioni finemente ricamate di Le Silla e Gucci. Alternative più accessibili ma altrettanto valide sono quelle di RIA Menorca, brand artigianale minorchino che dal 1947 produce le proprie originali abarcas menorquinas. Espadrillas con zeppa, tra altezza e comfort Oramai lo abbiamo capito, le zeppe sono tornate ad imperare questa estate e sì, chiaramente anche per quanto riguarda le espadrillas. Caratterizzate da una particolarmente elevata, quelle avvistate presso il fashion show di Stella McCartney erano in pelle scamosciata, in tonalità tortora, impreziosite da cuciture in rilievo ton sur ton. Quelle di Loewe, invece, somigliavano a vere e proprie mules realizzate in pelle color tabacco, perfette per slanciare la silhouette nella massima comodità. Espadrillas in tela, comodità rima con stile Pratiche e versatili, tra le favorite ci sono anche le classiche espadrillas in tela. Sulle passerelle della primavera/estate di Etro erano rese uniche dal sempiterno fascino del tessuto denim, decorato da un motivo floreale a renderle casual ma ricercate al tempo stesso. Fresche e giocose, quelle in tela di Missoni riprendevano l'emblematico motivo a zig zag della maison ma riproposto in tonalità pastello, in una dolcissima palette a sfumare dall'arancio al rosa, dal celeste al pistacchio. Espadrillas a fantasia, l'alternativa giocosa Voglia di qualcosa di diverso? Ci pensano le espadrillas a fantasia dell'estate 2025 ad esaudire il comune desiderio: grintosa e audace, la proposta bassa e portabile firmata Gianvito Rossi si distingueva per una stampa animalier ad esplorare i toni del marrone. Un modello che voleva ricalcare il design topico delle Mary Jane, siglato da una fibbia in oro. Quelle vivaci di Clergerie, ancora, presentavano una suola con plateau leggermente rialzata ed erano particolareggiate da ben due fibbie multicolore e dettagli in pelle. Espadrillas platform, perfette per slanciare la silhouette Ad unire slancio e praticità, poi, le espadrillas platform: oltre a quelle coloratissime appena citate di Clergerie, perfettamente conformi alla categoria in oggetto, hanno spiccato in passerella le romantiche e inaspettatamente delicate creazioni di Chloé. Il brand simbolo della corrente di stile boho-chic di cui le stesse scarpe di cui parliamo sono incarnazione le ha proposte quest'anno con tomaia crochet in corda naturale, una caratteristica che le rende un must dalla città alla spiaggia. Splendide e caratteristiche quelle di By Capri 1962. Italiaonline presenta prodotti e servizi che possono essere acquistati online su Amazon e/o su altri e-commerce.

Leather from cattle raised in deforested areas and on Indigenous land in the northern Brazilian state of Para is being turned into luxury items in Italy, according to an investigation.Designer brands such as Coach, Fendi and Hugo Boss have been listed as buyers of raw materials sourced from destroyed forests in Para, the northern Brazilian state set to host the UN Climate Conference, COP30, in November. The allegations, which most companies have denied, are detailed in a report published by Earthsight, a UK-based nonprofit focused on environmental and injustice investigations. Their findings draw on thousands of records of Brazilian leather exports, data on the cattle sector, court rulings and satellite imagery, as well as interviews and on-the-ground research. ""Consumers probably expect that when buying a luxury product, the high price tag guarantees some level of ethics and sustainability,"" Lara Shirra White, an Earthsight researcher, told DW. ""They don't expect that the leather bag might be linked to deforestation and human rights violations."" The NGO warns of products made from the hides of cattle reared on farms embargoed for environmental violations, including some operating illegally within Para's Apyterewa Indigenous Territory, which was heavily deforested during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro from 2019 to 2022. As part of its research, Earthsight investigated the business operations of Frigol, a Brazilian meatpacking company identified as one of the buyers of cattle raised on the territory. The report says at least 17,000 animals were sold to Frigol between 2020 and 2023, which is ""enough to produce 425 tons of leather."" Researchers linked some of those cattle to illegal farms but said it's not possible to determine the exact number that left Apyterewa, in part because Frigol itself ""does not trace most of its indirect suppliers."" The report says this gap in reporting leaves the company's ""supply chain vulnerable to the widespread practice of 'cattle laundering,'"" in which cows from illegal farms are transferred to legally registered properties before being sold. Paulo Barreto, senior researcher at the Brazilian conservation and sustainable development Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon, Imazon, said control over indirect suppliers is either nonexistent or incomplete. ""As a result, cattle raised in illegally deforested areas end up entering the market as if they were legal. The lack of a transparent public system regarding the origin of the cattle makes control difficult."" Frigol, however, told DW via email that it does not purchase cattle from Indigenous lands and monitors 100% of its direct suppliers. ""We are committed to working together with industry institutions, the production chain and public authorities to make progress,"" the company said in a statement. It added that it believes ""only individual traceability of animals for socio-environmental purposes will make it possible to mitigate deforestation across all links of the cattle supply chain."" Brazilian leather, Italian prestige According to Earthsight's research, after the animals are slaughtered at Frigol's facilities, a percentage of cow skins are exported, in part by the Brazilian leather company Durlicouros, which shipped 14,700 tons of hide to Italy between 2020 and 2023. Some of that, the report found, went to the Italian tanneries Conceria Cristina and Faeda. The research lists high-end names like Coach, Fendi, Chloé, Hugo Boss and Saint Laurent among Conceria Cristina's clients. Faeda, meanwhile, provides leather to brands such as Chanel, Balenciaga and Gucci, according to the investigation. In response to a DW request for comment, Chanel cited deforestation as a ""major concern"" and said it no longer works with Faeda due to unmet traceability requirements: ""92% of the calfskin we use is sourced from Europe, and we audit slaughterhouses and farms outside Europe to ensure they are not in deforestation zones."" The Kering Group, which owns Balenciaga, Gucci, and Saint Laurent, told DW that while the two Italian companies mentioned in the report are suppliers, ""the leather they provide to any Kering house does not come from Brazil."" Based on Earthsight's findings, Hugo Boss issued a statement to say it had conducted a detailed review, and could ""confirm that none of the leather"" it is supplied with ""is connected to any of the alleged parties in connection with the investigation."" LVMH, which owns Fendi and Louis Vuitton, said it has a system capable of tracing the origin of 98% of the leather used in its products and that it does not source this from South America. And Tapestry, which owns the Coach brand, wrote to DW saying that while the system for tracking raw materials in Brazil is ""complex and imperfect,"" it is working to be ""part of the solution to improve traceability and transparency."" Chloé, Conceria Cristina and Faeda had not responded to a DW request for comment at the time of publication. Flaws in the certification system Durlicouros told DW that it tracks its indirect suppliers and participates in discussions on state and national models for full traceability and compliance. ""In addition, all Durlicouros facilities are certified by the Leather Working Group (LWG), ensuring high standards of sustainability, traceability, and environmental responsibility, according to the purpose of each facility."" But Earthsight researcher Lara Shirra White said companies often use the certification to vouch for the ethics and sustainability of the leather they produce ""instead of conducting meaningful due diligence themselves to ensure their supply chains are deforestation-free."" She said the problem with the LWG, founded in 2005, is that ""it does not require traceability back to the farms,"" and can therefore not account for environmental and human rights abuses in the areas where the cattle are raised. The LWG told DW it is enhancing its ""due diligence requirements related to deforestation and land conversion,"" which will ""include establishing a chain of custody system that would support more detailed traceability across the leather value chain."" Can a shift come via Europe? There is some hope that the European Union's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) could make a contribution to change. Due to come into effect at the end of this year after a 12-month delay, it will ban the purchase of products originating from destroyed forest areas. ""We hope the law will be implemented on schedule, despite certain sectors of the industry still trying, in some way, to exclude leather from the scope of the legislation,"" Rafael Pieroni, a researcher at Earthsight, told DW. However, he said the report also contains a message for the Brazilian government. ""It should implement traceability and make all data public. Transparency is the best way to avoid all the illegalities we are exposing in our investigation,"" he said. This article was originally written in Portuguese.

Demand for personalized dating services is growing, according to companies interviewed by Bloomberg, with clients citing “app fatigue” and a desire for meaningful connection as the motivation for ditching the swipes. Matchmakers aim to find compatible romantic partners for serious relationships or marriage. Members are vetted before a first date, with checks on criminal and marriage records, and often get paired by preferences such as height or religion. The service is back in the cultural zeitgeist with A24's ""Materialists,"" a film about a high-powered matchmaker (Dakota Johnson) torn between a wealthy suitor (Pedro Pascal) and a poor one (Chris Evans) in her own love life. The film was written by director Celine Song, who once worked as a matchmaker in New York City. Opening weekend for ""Materialists"" brought in $12 million making it A24's third largest box office after ""Civil War"" and ""Hereditary."" Online dating, with its endless swiping and the possibility of someone better just around the corner, is increasingly frustrating to some users. And in-person meetups often don't match digital expectations. “It's a hellscape,” New York City resident Christine Russo says about dating apps. “It's exhausting especially if you're really putting the time and effort and energy into it while working full-time.” Paying users at Match Group Inc.'s Tinder has declined for eight consecutive quarters, and the business isn't expected to return to revenue growth until 2027. Former Three Day Rule user Elliot Galpern met his now wife through the service and has no regrets on the four-figure price tag. His matchmaker helped with first date outfits and confidence-boosting tips. “You know, you can't get dating advice from people nowadays,” Galpern says. However, the service isn't guaranteed to work, and failure can be made extra frustrating by the expense. “If one of the matches, or if all of the matches don't work out you're kind of screwed,” says Paige, an elementary school teacher who paid $7,000 dollars for nine months at one service and is onto her third. “It's a lot of money for a boyfriend. It's weird.” The hefty price also comes with a higher expectation. “If I only am given a certain number of matches for this service I'm paying for, I'm gonna be pretty scrupulous,” Lizzie Guarino told Bloomberg. Guarino was once quoted almost $8,900 for six months and $5,900 for three months at Three Day Rule. She chose a lower-cost rival, though met her now fiancé elsewhere. Though matchmaking is a premium service, it's been largely unaffected by the economic hurdles facing luxury spending. Top-tier brands such as Hermes International SCA and Gucci owner Kering SA are losing customers who are reigning in their spending, while mid-tier brands like Ralph Lauren Corp. are performing well by providing quality at more affordable prices. Costs for matchmaking services can reach as high as six figures. In contrast, dating apps tend to offer less expensive, multitiered subscriptions. Hinge offers packages from $29.99 per month, while Tinder's most expensive subscription costs $500 per month. Match has tried getting in on the high-price action with its acquisition of The League, a matchmaking service that targets young professionals, in 2022. “There is a huge difference between a dating app, which is self-selected, filter your way into perfection, a wild wild west,” Cohen-Aslatei says. “Versus matchmaking, where someone gets to know you.” The more they get to spend time with a client and uncover who they really are, the better they are able to do vetting. “They interview people for you and they really go on first dates for you,” he adds. A nurse who worked with Three Day Rule was willing to reallocate some personal funds to find a match. “She always goes on a yearly trip with her girlfriends to Hawaii,” Cohen-Aslatei says, adding that instead she now “saves five or six thousand dollars and gets an entry-level package.” Signups have noticeably ticked upward among men age 23 to 30, according to NYCity Matchmaking owner Michelle Frankel, who attributes the shift to missed dating opportunities during the pandemic. The trend is unfolding alongside discussions of a “loneliness epidemic and, you know, men experiencing that” Chief Strategy Officer Greg Johnson at matchmaking company Kelleher International said. NYCity Matchmaking had to hire three additional matchmakers over the past three months to meet up with demand. “I could see the trend and I just knew we were getting busier and busier,” Frankel says. “And you know, with this movie coming out, I'm sure we're gonna be even busier.” —With assistance from Natalie Lung and Rachel Phua."

En el caso de Macowens, salió ahora en su página web con ofertas de chalecos, sweaters y camisas viyela a $29.900, camperas a $ 45.900, remeras a $ 19.900. La marca de indumentaria masculina Equus, que había informado rebajas de hasta 40% hace pocos días, para equiparar valores vigentes en 2024, fue por más y liquida camperas Equus lyon marino a $ 106,244 e infladas para hombres Equus Siena en $ 77.241. Zara publicitó precios especiales de sus líneas más exclusivas, en conmemoración de su 50 aniversario, en un show de presentaciones a cargo de 50 modelos top internacionales. Por ejemplo, ofrece Bright Ros con un 26% de descuento en $ARS 49.999, sudaderas con el 49% a $AR 29.999 y camisetas con un 30% a $AR 15.999.

Las prendas de vestir básicas y atemporales, como camisetas, jeans y vestidos casuales, siguen siendo las favoritas del público argentino.

Las 10 marcas argentinas de ropa para mujer que destacan por su estilo, variedad y calidad son Kosiuko, Awada, Ayres, Rapsodia, Rimmel, Ver, Sweet, Peuque, Markova, y Yagmour. Las más lujosas, Hermès, Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Christian Dior, Versace, Fendi, Prada, Yves Saint Laurent y Burberry. Entre otras marcas destacadas, especialmente en el ámbito del diseño independiente y de autor, se incluyen Kostüme, con un estilo único y vanguardista, y marcas como Pólvora y Adrián Brown, según MalevaMag. Además, existen marcas de moda inclusiva y plus-size como Noctámbula y Limay Denim, que ofrecen opciones para diferentes tipos de cuerpo. Casos como el de La Martina trascienden como marcas argentinas muy conocidas por su ropa y accesorios relacionados con el polo y otros deportes. Las grandes ausencias Entre las marcas de ropa que desaparecieron o redujeron significativamente su presencia en el mercado nacional se incluyen a las históricas Vitamina y Uma, que cerraron sus tiendas físicas directas. También otras internacionales como Kenzo, Calvin Klein, Louis Vuitton, Yves Saint Laurent, Ralph Lauren, Escada, Cartier, y Emporio Armani, disminuyeron su presencia o dejaron de operar directamente en el país. Además, marcas de ropa deportiva y urbana como Billabong, Quiksilver y Volcom, pertenecientes a Liberated Brand, cesaron debido a problemas financieros de la empresa matriz."

1lmvxz3,2025-06-28 20:01:29,en,REDDIT,"  Chapter 1 TWENTY-THREE STORIES UP AND ALL I COULD SEE OUT THE WINDOWS was grey smog. They could call it the City of Angels if they wanted to, but if there were angels out there, they had to be flying blind. Los Angeles is a place where people, those with wings and without, come to hide. Hide from others, hide from themselves. I'd come to hide and I'd succeeded, but staring out at the thick, dirty air, I wanted to go home. Home where the air was blue most of the time and you didn't have to water the ground to get grass to grow. Home was Cahokia, Illinois, but I couldn't go back because they'd kill me if I did, my relatives and their allies. Everyone wants to grow up to be a faerie princess. Trust me. It's overrated. There was a knock on the office door. It opened before I could say anything. My boss, Jeremy Grey, stood framed in the doorway. He was a short, grey man, four feet eleven inches, an inch shorter than me. He was grey from his dark Armani suit to his button-up shirt and silk tie. Only his shoes were black and shiny. Even his skin was a pale uniform grey. Not from illness or age. No, he was a trow in the prime of life, just a little over four hundred. There were some lines around his eyes, along the thin mouth, that made him appear mature, but he'd never be old. Without the aid of mortal blood and a pretty serious spell, Jeremy might live forever. Theoretically. Scientists say that in about five billion years the sun will expand and engulf the Earth. The fey won't survive that. They will die. Does five billion years count as forever? I don't think so. Though it's close enough to make the rest of us envious. I leaned my back against the windows and the thick, hanging smog. The day was as grey as my boss, but his color was a cool, crisp grey, like clouds before a spring rain. What lay outside the window felt heavy and thick like something you would try to swallow, but you'd never get it down. It was a day to choke on, or maybe it was just my mood. “You look gloomy, Merry,” Jeremy said. “What's wrong?” He closed the door behind him, making sure it shut. Privacy, he was giving us privacy. Maybe it was for my benefit, but somehow I didn't think so. There was a tightness around his eyes, a set to his thin, well-tailored shoulders that said I wasn't the only one in a bad mood today. Maybe it was the weather or the lack of it. A good rain shower or even a good wind would have cleared out the smog and let the city breathe again. “Homesick,” I said. “What's wrong, Jeremy?” He gave a small smile. “Can't fool you, can I, Merry?” “No,” I said. “Nice outfit,” he said. I knew I looked hot when Jeremy complimented my clothes. He always looked impeccable even in jeans and T-shirt, which he only wore if he absolutely had to be undercover. I'd seen Jeremy do a three-minute mile in Gucci loafers once, chasing a suspect...."

mov_BDA8E24A1FE201DE24428389259BDF81,2025-06-28 20:50:38,en,WEB,"  Frustrated with dating apps, singles are are shelling out for high-end matchmaking. “We had our biggest month of sales in the history of the company last month, and we've been around for 15 years,” Adam Cohen-Aslatei, CEO of the matchmaking service Three Day Rule says. “Our business is not shrinking.” And he's not alone. Demand for personalized dating services is growing, according to companies interviewed by Bloomberg, with clients citing “app fatigue” and a desire for meaningful connection as the motivation for ditching the swipes. Matchmakers aim to find compatible romantic partners for serious relationships or marriage. Members are vetted before a first date, with checks on criminal and marriage records, and often get paired by preferences such as height or religion. The service is back in the cultural zeitgeist with A24's “Materialists,” a film about a high-powered matchmaker (Dakota Johnson) torn between a wealthy suitor (Pedro Pascal) and a poor one (Chris Evans) in her own love life. The film was written by director Celine Song, who once worked as a matchmaker in New York City. Opening weekend for “Materialists” brought in $12 million making it A24's third largest box office after “Civil War” and “Hereditary.” Online dating, with its endless swiping and the possibility of someone better just around the corner, is increasingly frustrating to some users. And in-person meetups often don't match digital expectations. “It's a hellscape,” New York City resident Christine Russo says about dating apps. “It's exhausting especially if you're really putting the time and effort and energy into it while working full-time.” Paying users at Match Group Inc.'s Tinder has declined for eight consecutive quarters, and the business isn't expected to return to revenue growth until 2027. Former Three Day Rule user Elliot Galpern met his now wife through the service and has no regrets on the four-figure price tag. His matchmaker helped with first date outfits and confidence-boosting tips. “You know, you can't get dating advice from people nowadays,” Galpern says. However, the service isn't guaranteed to work, and failure can be made extra frustrating by the expense. “If one of the matches, or if all of the matches don't work out you're kind of screwed,” says Paige, an elementary school teacher who paid $7,000 dollars for nine months at one service and is onto her third. “It's a lot of money for a boyfriend. It's weird.” The hefty price also comes with a higher expectation. “If I only am given a certain number of matches for this service I'm paying for, I'm gonna be pretty scrupulous,” Lizzie Guarino told Bloomberg. Guarino was once quoted almost $8,900 for six months and $5,900 for three months at Three Day Rule. She chose a lower-cost rival, though met her now fiancé elsewhere. Though matchmaking is a premium service, it's been largely unaffected by the economic hurdles facing luxury spending. Top-tier brands such as Hermes International SCA and Gucci owner Kering SA are losing customers who are reigning in their spending, while mid-tier brands like Ralph Lauren Corp. are performing well by providing quality at more affordable prices. Costs for matchmaking services can reach as high as six figures. In contrast, dating apps tend to offer less expensive, multitiered subscriptions. Hinge offers packages from $29.99 per month, while Tinder's most expensive subscription costs $500 per month. Match has tried getting in on the high-price action with its acquisition of The League, a matchmaking service that targets young professionals, in 2022. “There is a huge difference between a dating app, which is self-selected, filter your way into perfection, a wild wild west,” Cohen-Aslatei says. “Versus matchmaking, where someone gets to know you.” The more they get to spend time with a client and uncover who they really are, the better they are able to do vetting. “They interview people for you and they really go on first dates for you,” he adds. A nurse who worked with Three Day Rule was willing to reallocate some personal funds to find a match. “She always goes on a yearly trip with her girlfriends to Hawaii,” Cohen-Aslatei says, adding that instead she now “saves five or six thousand dollars and gets an entry-level package.” Signups have noticeably ticked upward among men age 23 to 30, according to NYCity Matchmaking owner Michelle Frankel, who attributes the shift to missed dating opportunities during the pandemic. The trend is unfolding alongside discussions of a “loneliness epidemic and, you know, men experiencing that” Chief Strategy Officer Greg Johnson at matchmaking company Kelleher International said. NYCity Matchmaking had to hire three additional matchmakers over the past three months to meet up with demand. “I could see the trend and I just knew we were getting busier and busier,” Frankel says. “And you know, with this movie coming out, I'm sure we're gonna be even busier.”"

n0b590o,2025-06-28 21:43:48,en,REDDIT,"  To sell in a western country (US as an example), all companies are subject to the same standards. But more than often western branded are made in the same exact facilities as their ""knockoffs"", so the bar is just as low, the only difference is the price. This was proved and is well documented for a lot of designer clothing brands (I believe the last one that got caught was Gucci) and hardware spare parts. The companies you say have a ""higher bar"" are just really good at bluewashing and greenwashing since they make 100x more money and interest in covering up their image compared to the often small chinese buisnesses you find on AliEx."

Known for effortlessly fusing tradition with high fashion, she made heads turn at the grand wedding celebration of Amazon founder, Jeff Bezos and Lauren Sanchez in Venice, Italy. For the occasion, the trendsetter picked a 1960s vintage London fine canary-yellow slubbed silk evening gown from the shelves of Christian Dior. The two-toned ensemble featured a fitted, embellished upper bodice and a voluminous skirt flowing waist downwards. The sleeveless number came with a horizontal, banded construction with multiple, evenly spaced horizontal rows. The bodice of the gown was adorned with intricate embellishments such as sequins, beads and shimmering threads. The tiny reflective elements catch the light, adding  glamorous sparkle to the look. Her high-waisted skirt featured a poofy, dramatic silhouette, reaching the floor. Made from a satin-like fabric, the skirt was gathered at the waist, creating volume and a slight puffed effect at the top. It featured a front drape effect that added visual interest to the dress. The vibrant orchre yellow colour of the gown contrasted strikingly with the embellished upper bodice. For her accessories, Natasha Poonawalla chose a sterling silver Hermes Mini Kelly hand bag. She also wore a pair of studs and a statement ring on her left hand. Dark, rectangular sunglasses and beaded fringe pumps from the house of Gucci completed her attire. Makeup-wise, Natasha opted for a radiant base, dark eyeliner with a slight wing, mascara-laden lashes and well-defined eyebrows. Her lips were painted in a soft, neutral shade that balanced the bold eye makeup look. She styled her hair in a sleek, straight manner with a middle parting, that fell gracefully over her shoulders.

S filmi, kot je Paterson, Tišina, Poročilo, Poročna zgodba, Zadnji dvoboj , in Hiša Gucci . Najbolj znan je po vlogi Kyla Rena v Vojna zvezd nadaljevanje trilogije. Je močan izvajalec, ki se lahko posveti kateri koli vlogi, ki mu je dana, in zagotovi zvezdniške in nepozabne nastope. Tako kot mnogi igralci je imel tudi Driver dneve na avdicijah, ko je poskušal dobiti igralske nastope in je nenehno poskušal ljudem dokazati svojo vrednost. Toda Driver je imel edinstveno miselnost in perspektivo, s katero se je udeležil svojih avdicij, kar mu je pomagalo, da se je soočil z zavrnitvami in hitro nadaljeval z drugimi stvarmi. Preberite tudi: Adam Driver skoraj rekel ne Kylo Ren iz Vojne zvezd zaradi serije Judda Apatowa Adam Driver je imel namerno ciničen način razmišljanja, ko je šel na avdicijo Adam Driver , kot mnogi igralci, je moral najti svojo pot v industrijo tako, da je šel skozi številne avdicije in upal, da ga bodo opazili ljudje z močjo in avtoriteto. Imel je še posebej ciničen način, da je šel na avdicijo, kar se je izkazalo za koristno zanj, če stvari niso delovale. Povedal je WWD , »Naučil sem se, da sem sovražil vse v sobi, kadar koli grem na avdicijo. Na ta način, če se ne izide, si lahko rečem: 'Ti ljudje mi vseeno niso bili všeč!' « Driverjev pristop k avdicijam je resnično zdrav način za soočanje s kakršno koli zavrnitvijo, s katero se igralci običajno srečujejo med avdicijo za nastope. Kasneje je navdušil ustvarjalce, kot je Lena Dunham, ki mu je dala prvo večjo igralsko vlogo Adama Sacklerja v dekleta . Zdaj je postal eden najbolj iskanih igralcev sedanje generacije. Preberite tudi: Adam Driver je šel izjemno dolgo za Martina Scorseseja, šel skozi alarmantno preobrazbo, da bi zadostil zahtevam scenarija Adam Driver je nedavno kritiziral velike studie zaradi stavk v Hollywoodu Adam Driver je nedavno premierno predstavil svoj film Ferrari na beneškem filmskem festivalu 2023. Na tiskovni konferenci filma je Driver komentiral hollywoodske stavke in kritiziral velike studie, kot sta Netflix in Amazon, ker se ne zavedajo pomena zahtev sindikata SAG-AFTRA. Rekel je (prek Hollywoodski poročevalec ), »Zelo sem vesel, da sem tukaj in podpiram ta film, vendar sem tudi zelo ponosen, da sem tukaj, da sem vizualna predstavitev filma, ki ni del AMPTP, in da promoviram vodstveno direktivo SAG – ki je učinkovita taktika – kar je vmesni sporazum. Zakaj lahko manjše distribucijsko podjetje, kot sta [Ferrarijev] Neon in STX International, izpolni sanjske zahteve tega, kar [SAG] zahteva ... vendar veliko podjetje, kot sta Netflix in Amazon, ne more? Samo bolj očitno je, da so ti ljudje pripravljeni podpreti ljudi, s katerimi sodelujejo, drugi pa ne.” Kar zadeva delo, Driverjev biografski športni dramski film Ferrari naj bi v kinematografih izšel 25. decembra 2023. Prav tako naj bi vodil znanstvenofantastični ep Francisa Forda Coppole megalopolis, poleg Foresta Whitakerja, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jona Voighta, Laurencea Fishburna, Aubrey Plaza, Shia LaBeoufa in Giancarla Esposita. Preberite tudi: »Mann ni najbolj čustveno ekspresiven režiser«: 'Ferrariju' Adama Driverja manjka čustev, po premieri na beneškem filmskem festivalu je deležen kritik Ali vam je bilo to v pomoč?

mov_A3A021CB46E5A5E6DE36F6F497ED32DE,2025-06-29 11:38:04,en,WEB,"  London: Designer brands such as Coach, Fendi and Hugo Boss have been listed as buyers of raw materials sourced from destroyed forests in Para, the northern Brazilian state set to host the UN Climate Conference, COP30, in November. The allegations, which most companies have denied, are detailed in a report published by Earthsight, a UK-based nonprofit focused on environmental and injustice investigations. Their findings draw on thousands of records of Brazilian leather exports, data on the cattle sector, court rulings and satellite imagery, as well as interviews and on-the-ground research. ""Consumers probably expect that when buying a luxury product, the high price tag guarantees some level of ethics and sustainability,"" Lara Shirra White, an Earthsight researcher, told DW. ""They don't expect that the leather bag might be linked to deforestation and human rights violations."" The NGO warns of products made from the hides of cattle reared on farms embargoed for environmental violations, including some operating illegally within Para's Apyterewa Indigenous Territory, which was heavily deforested during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro from 2019 to 2022. As part of its research, Earthsight investigated the business operations of Frigol, a Brazilian meatpacking company identified as one of the buyers of cattle raised on the territory. The report says at least 17,000 animals were sold to Frigol between 2020 and 2023, which is ""enough to produce 425 tonnes of leather."" Researchers linked some of those cattle to illegal farms but said it's not possible to determine the exact number that left Apyterewa, in part because Frigol itself ""does not trace most of its indirect suppliers."" The report says this gap in reporting leaves the company's ""supply chain vulnerable to the widespread practice of 'cattle laundering,'"" in which cows from illegal farms are transferred to legally registered properties before being sold. Paulo Barreto, senior researcher at the Brazilian conservation and sustainable development Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon, Imazon, said control over indirect suppliers is either nonexistent or incomplete. ""As a result, cattle raised in illegally deforested areas end up entering the market as if they were legal. The lack of a transparent public system regarding the origin of the cattle makes control difficult."" Frigol, however, told DW via email that it does not purchase cattle from Indigenous lands and monitors 100% of its direct suppliers. ""We are committed to working together with industry institutions, the production chain and public authorities to make progress,"" the company said in a statement. It added that it believes ""only individual traceability of animals for socio-environmental purposes will make it possible to mitigate deforestation across all links of the cattle supply chain."" Brazilian leather, Italian prestige According to Earthsight's research, after the animals are slaughtered at Frigol's facilities, a percentage of cow skins are exported, in part by the Brazilian leather company Durlicouros, which shipped 14,700 tonnes of hide to Italy between 2020 and 2023. Some of that, the report found, went to the Italian tanneries Conceria Cristina and Faeda. The research lists high-end names like Coach, Fendi, Chloé, Hugo Boss and Saint Laurent among Conceria Cristina's clients. Faeda, meanwhile, provides leather to brands such as Chanel, Balenciaga and Gucci, according to the investigation. In response to a DW request for comment, Chanel cited deforestation as a ""major concern"" and said it no longer works with Faeda due to unmet traceability requirements: ""92% of the calfskin we use is sourced from Europe, and we audit slaughterhouses and farms outside Europe to ensure they are not in deforestation zones."" The Kering Group, which owns Balenciaga, Gucci, and Saint Laurent, told DW that while the two Italian companies mentioned in the report are suppliers, ""the leather they provide to any Kering house does not come from Brazil."" Based on Earthsight's findings, Hugo Boss issued a statement to say it had conducted a detailed review, and could ""confirm that none of the leather"" it is supplied with ""is connected to any of the alleged parties in connection with the investigation."" LVMH, which owns Fendi and Louis Vuitton, said it has a system capable of tracing the origin of 98% of the leather used in its products and that it does not source this from South America. And Tapestry, which owns the Coach brand, wrote to DW saying that while the system for tracking raw materials in Brazil is ""complex and imperfect,"" it is working to be ""part of the solution to improve traceability and transparency."" Chloé, Conceria Cristina and Faeda had not responded to a DW request for comment at the time of publication. Flaws in the certification system Durlicouros told DW that it tracks its indirect suppliers and participates in discussions on state and national models for full traceability and compliance. ""In addition, all Durlicouros facilities are certified by the Leather Working Group (LWG), ensuring high standards of sustainability, traceability, and environmental responsibility, according to the purpose of each facility."" But Earthsight researcher Lara Shirra White said companies often use the certification to vouch for the ethics and sustainability of the leather they produce ""instead of conducting meaningful due diligence themselves to ensure their supply chains are deforestation-free."" She said the problem with the LWG, founded in 2005, is that ""it does not require traceability back to the farms,"" and can therefore not account for environmental and human rights abuses in the areas where the cattle are raised. The LWG told DW it is enhancing its ""due diligence requirements related to deforestation and land conversion,"" which will ""include establishing a chain of custody system that would support more detailed traceability across the leather value chain."" Can a shift come via Europe? There is some hope that the European Union's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) could make a contribution to change. Due to come into effect at the end of this year after a 12-month delay, it will ban the purchase of products originating from destroyed forest areas. ""We hope the law will be implemented on schedule, despite certain sectors of the industry still trying, in some way, to exclude leather from the scope of the legislation,"" Rafael Pieroni, a researcher at Earthsight, told DW. However, he said the report also contains a message for the Brazilian government. ""It should implement traceability and make all data public. Transparency is the best way to avoid all the illegalities we are exposing in our investigation,"" he said."

mov_0BE9CFD5E8B27CB19BCDF92B83EF7206,2025-06-29 18:00:39,en,WEB,"  WARNING: Graphic content A British couple whose son died in Spain in mysterious circumstances have released footage of his blood-stained home because they believe he was murdered. Father-of-one Brett Dryden, 35, was found dead at his home in Mojácar on the Costa de Almeria on July 21, 2024, after failing to return from an afternoon nap. The former Nissan factory worker had a large four-centimetre-long gash above his right eye and the walls and furniture were covered in bloody handprints, which MailOnline can show for the first time. Brett's home had also been burglarised, with his phone, wallet, designer Gucci sunglasses and car keys all missing. Even the autopsy report, carried out the day after his body was found by friends, mentions that 'signs of a struggle were observed in the home, as well as bloodstains in several locations'. It also notes that the 'Judicial Police later reported that his home had been robbed'. But despite those details, the postmortem ruled that the death was caused by acute alveolar hemorrhage - a condition in which bleeding occurs into the air sacs of the lungs. The medical examiners who carried out the autopsy claimed it was triggered by a pulmonary embolism caused by the use of cocaine and cannabis - and the case was closed the same day. But Brett's mother Sandra Adams, 56, from Chester-le-Street in County Durham, has now repatriated her son's body and ordered a new autopsy in the hopes of getting fresh answers. She believes there are a number of aspects that suggest there was foul play at work in her son's death - and is raising money through GoFundMe to fight for justice. The grieving mother told MailOnline: 'They claimed he fell and bashed his head. With a pulmonary embolism it's not a quick death, there was blood all over his villa, there was bloody handprints - the only reason we know that is my husband went into the villa and took photos of it all.' After Brett's possessions were reported missing by Sandra four days after Brett's death, a local court ordered the police to reopen the case as a homicide investigation. Around a week after Brett's body was found, Sandra's husband Rob Adams, 53, was able to source CCTV footage of the street outside Brett's house, which was sent direct to the local Guardia. The video evidence showed two men running away from Brett's home with a bag. It was the same bag that Brett was earlier seen leaving his bar with - leaving Sandra to believe it contained the bar's previous night's takings. The case report, which Sandra was only able to access in the last few weeks after hiring a Spanish lawyer, also notes that the faces of the men on the CCTV were visible. Brett's MacBook was also still attached to his phone and using the Find My iPhone app, Sandra was able to see that it was still in use. She said: 'I went on and it was in Vera and kept pinging in different locations but kept going back to a certain house. The Guardia said ""We know"" but didn't seem that interested.' The family also found out that around 1pm on the day Brett died, he had been on the phone with his colleague but had ended the call abruptly with the words: 'I've got to go, they're here'. Brett managed a cannabis bar in Mojácar, where he had lived for five-and-a-half years, having originally moved there with his then-girlfriend when his daughter Charlie was three months old. Sandra said: 'Brett was very adventurous and outdoorsy. He loved to travel and try different foods. He was a good dad and he adored his daughter.' The family went to Disneyland Paris in February for Brett's daughter Charley's fifth birthday and the year before he went to Ibiza with his mother after she was diagnosed with cancer. Sandra said: 'He came home to the UK a lot and Facetimed us all the time. 'He was so kind. The lady next door to where he lived told us that Brett put up her television for her and described him as a 'lovely boy'. He also bought a blanket and food and 10 euros for a homeless guy. 'He didn't have any enemies, he was only little - he would never look for trouble but he could look after himself. We used to say 'you have little man syndrome' because he was only 5ft 6½in.' Sandra believes that the previous week's takings from the bar - as much as £6,000 - may have been stolen from his home, while Brett's car door was also open with his keys missing - despite usually parking at the back of his property. She said: 'I asked the police do they have his sunglasses, phone, wallet and they said ""yeah yeah yeah"". 'We went to see him in the funeral home and I just got this gut feeling that it wasn't an accident, it wasn't natural causes. 'Before I went to see him we were going to have him cremated because Spain was his home, but once I saw him I decided to repatriate him for another autopsy to be done. 'We went to court for Brett's body to be released, but in between that time I noticed they didn't have his phone, wallet, sunglasses. They asked the code for his phone, and it was for his old phone, a Samsung, whereas I knew he had an iPhone.' Police also let two of Brett's friends twice walk through the crime scene to get his dog, an XL Bully. Sandra described the devastation of hearing the news of Brett's death while she was on her way back from her job. She said: 'I was driving home from work and Rob rang me at 10.10pm and he was hysterical. 'He said ""Did you see the call from Brett's friend?"" I'd spoken to Brett in the morning. He was well and happy and his normally bubbly self. To get that call to say he had passed away was devastating.' The day after Brett's passing, a newspaper in Spain published a story claiming that it was a violent death on June 22 and that it looked like he had been struck in the head by an axe - but two days later the same paper ran a story reporting that it was actually a pulmonary embolism. The family flew over to Spain. The Guardia told Sandra that Brett had actually had a pulmonary embolism. However, the autopsy describes a 5cm x 4cm wound to the 'right side of his head, above his eye' with 'irregular, crescent-shaped edges on the forehead, transverse to the axis of the right eyebrow.'..."

Few embody this shift more convincingly than BTS's Jin, whose recent solo fan concert reaffirmed his standing as one of K-pop's most beloved and enduring figures. Held on Saturday at Goyang Sports Complex in Gyeonggi Province, Jin's “RunSeokjin_EP. Tour in Goyang” was far more than a nostalgic fan event. Between his playful banter and familiar laughter, Jin revealed a deeper emotional resonance, inviting fans to reflect on the years he has quietly but steadily built his presence, not only as a performer, but as a person. Jin's continued popularity extends beyond BTS's famously loyal fandom. His appeal lies in his embodiment of what today's content-driven era values most: sincerity, stability, and a carefully honed imperfection. Unlike the polished perfection of past celebrity ideals, Jin represents a new archetype, someone who allows space for vulnerability, who evolves publicly without self-aggrandizement, and who remains grounded regardless of global fame. When BTS debuted in 2013, Jin, then the eldest but not the most prominently spotlighted member, rarely pushed himself to the front. Instead, he cultivated trust through consistency: showing up, performing with integrity, and letting his growth speak for itself. Over time, that quiet commitment solidified his image as someone fans could count on. His trademark sense of humor, long appreciated on BTS's web variety series ""Run BTS"" and appearances on such shows as ""The Game Caterers,"" has only grown more nuanced. Jin kicks off his solo fan concert tour. Courtesy of BigHit Music Rather than dominating conversations, Jin has a talent for creating space for others to shine, drawing out laughter not through punchlines but through rhythm and timing. Jin's ability to evoke laughter through rhythm rather than words reflects the essence of the “human-centered asset” that resonates in today's era. Jin's post-military return has been equally impactful beyond the stage. As a torchbearer for the upcoming Paris 2024 Olympics and a global ambassador for Gucci, he continues to wield influence across multiple spheres. International media have hailed his comeback as “a milestone that proves his relevance beyond K-pop,” noting his participation in global projects even after his enlistment. The Goyang concert was both a celebration of Jin's artistic maturity and a symbolic prelude to BTS's eventual full-group return. Foreign outlets emphasized how Jin not only performed his solo tracks but also reinterpreted BTS's iconic hits, delivering emotional resonance and nostalgia that moved fans around the world. In an industry where stars rise and fall in a flash, Jin stands apart by advancing at his own pace, rooted in a rhythm uniquely his own. His continued growth and unwavering humanity make him more than just an idol. They make him a meaningful figure in the evolving narrative of global entertainment. As fans and industry watchers alike look ahead, one thing is clear: Jin isn't just part of BTS's legacy. He is shaping a new standard for what it means to be a star in the content age.

It can't take photos, inspect and clean, or pack items. Obviously it can't source. I DO use it to write emails to take out my more blunt edge. I use Google lens for the obvious, and Chat GPT to do useful stuff like inform me that a Gucci item I thought I had was indeed fake based on a photo of a lable that it found didn't match any others from them.

mov_29E580BFF406B55EE91F442EBDB80EAC,2025-06-30 05:00:10,en,WEB,"  Once reserved for fitness fanatics and Silicon Valley insiders, wearable tech is entering a new era – one of precious metals and exquisite craftsmanship. Smart jewellery is now a fashion-forward essential, merging high design with intelligent functionality. As the boundaries between style and innovation continue to blur, the luxury world is paying close attention, rethinking what adornment can offer beyond beauty alone. Today's upscale pieces aren't just decorative – they're practical, signalling a future where aesthetics and utility are seamlessly intertwined. After all, smartwatches have long bridged the gap between function and finesse. Leading the latest charge is the Apple Watch Series 10, with its advanced health features and streamlined design. Hublot's Big Bang e Gen3 is powered by the brand's powerful Wear OS technology, offering extravagance without compromising functionality. Meanwhile, Tag Heuer's Connected Calibre E4 channels classic Swiss watchmaking through a digital lens with a high-definition screen and data-driven fitness goals. Whichever is your preference, these accomplished timepieces prove that engineering and elegance aren't mutually exclusive. Jewellers are putting their stamp on wearable technology too. At the heart of this revolution lies a blend of digital flair and artisanal skill, showcased by smart rings and bracelets fitted with biometric sensors, AI-driven features and contactless payment systems. Far from the clunky, utilitarian wearables of the past, these pieces are often crafted with precious metals and adorned with dustings of gemstones. Limited-edition creations, such as the Gucci × Oura Ring, further introduced functionality into sought-after designer collectibles. The Gucci x Oura collaboration, which was unveiled in May 2022, fused the Italian fashion house's signature motifs and opulent materials with the Finnish health tech company's advanced biometric tracking technology. Described by Gucci as “a smart accessory that tracks the body's messages to provide personal insights that allow the wearer to own their potential”, the ring combines high fashion, in the form of Gucci's instantly recognisable interlocking G motif and intricate braided torchon detailing, with Oura's health-tracking technology. Like the original, more tech-led products, these bands discreetly monitor sleep, heart rate, temperature and activity, among other metrics. The likes of the Gucci x Oura collection demonstrate that such accessories are as appropriate for the boardroom or red carpet as they are for the gym; proof positive that smart jewellery is the new frontier for a style‑and‑tech‑savvy generation that places equal value on elegance and cutting-edge technology. After all, this trend's rise results from a perfect storm of refined aesthetics and shifting consumer priorities. Market research company Custom Market Insights forecasts the global smart jewellery sector will nearly triple in size over the next decade. Fuelled by the surging popularity of connected devices among younger buyers – particularly Gen Z and millennials – demand is booming for multifunctional accessories that marry connectivity with design. Collaborations between digital trailblazers and luxury labels – think Apple Watch Hermès – and advances in miniaturised sensors have elevated smart jewellery from niche novelty to mainstream staple. Embracing the ethos of “quiet luxury”, these pieces favour subtle discretion over flashy logos and seamlessly integrate into daily life. Rather than announcing their capabilities, they whisper them, appealing to modern consumers who demand ever more from their purchases and regard such technology as an essential. That said, integrating technology into jewellery is not without its challenges. Battery life and shifting digital standards clash with jewellery's inherent timelessness – after all, a gold band is meant to last generations, not product cycles. To bridge this gap, engineers are prioritising upgradability: some smart rings feature interchangeable cores, swappable components or structures designed for longevity, while others receive wireless software updates, ensuring the piece evolves alongside emerging technologies without compromising its potential heirloom status. Today, more brands are willing to take these risks for the chance to become leaders in the field. Health-monitoring platform Ultrahuman launched its Rare collection of smart rings, crafted in 18k gold or platinum. Similarly, British brand Vertu, known for its sophisticated smartphones, unveiled its AI Diamond Rings line. Part statement piece, part digital assistant, these glitzy accessories feature real-time translation, online search, voice control and calendar management. Diamond settings carefully conceal the tech, ultimately rendering the AI Diamond Ring virtually indistinguishable from fine jewellery. As smart jewellery secures its place as a modern must-have, it's clear this is more than a passing trend. Once purely ornamental, jewellery now fuses elegance with intelligence – much like how handbags evolved from practical accessories into status symbols. For designer brands and storied maisons, the challenge is to uphold traditional craftsmanship while embracing a future where functionality is just as vital. As wearable tech becomes ever more refined, jewellery won't just be worn – it will be lived in."

mov_D4D69EAEE2322102C42AD3F1B00F8A43,2025-06-30 09:00:52,en,WEB,"  International fashion Model Binx Walton returned to her hometown to debut her most personal project. The three-part project, ""Landscapes of the Mind,"" includes a book, a 27-minute instrumental vinyl record and custom high fidelity sound system. The multimedia debut at Beck Cultural Exchange Center in Knoxville was featured in Essence and W magazines. Model Binx Walton has been all around the world walking the runways for Alexander McQueen, Christian Dior, Prada, Gucci, Tom Ford and countless other high fashion designers. She has appeared on the covers of British Vogue, Italian Vogue, French Elle and Dazed magazine. But it was Knoxville where she had to debut her most personal project to date. Walton, who spent much of her adolescence in Knoxville, premiered her multimedia project “Landscapes of the Mind” at Beck Cultural Exchange Center for a one-night-only affair on June 12. “Landscapes” is an ""immersive, introspective experience that blends sound, written word and sculptural design to explore emotional landscapes, memory and personal transformation,” according to the artist. A real conversation between lovers “Landscapes of the Mind” is a three-part multimedia project featuring a written book, vinyl recording and a custom sound system to create an authentic listening experience. At its core, the story is about the evolution of love and personal growth. Need a break?

She was then inspired to put the words to music while listening to the record “Harvest Time” (1977) by saxophonist Pharoah Sanders. Walton created the project using the name Lee Walton. She shared with Knox News what inspired her to step outside of the world of fashion to experiment with writing and music, and why it was important for her to share it with Knoxville first. She collaborated with a former lover who created the 27-minute instrumental portion “Landscapes of the Mind.” “Everything happened organically. That doesn't mean without a tremendous amount of work, but there was a conscious following of some intangible energy that led one aspect of the project to the next,” Walton said of the creative process. She described the project as “a real conversation between lovers, which I really grew to love - although at times, it feels insufferable to experience.” Knoxville shaped an international model Walton was last in Knoxville several years ago, when her grandfather died. Debuting “Landscapes of the Mind” in her hometown was unexpected, but necessary. “I left (Knoxville) thinking there wasn't much for me here anymore — but through this project, I found I was a long way from the truth. Knoxville is such a big part of who I am. It shaped my perception of a lot of the world, good and bad,” Walton said. “I've always kept the reality of my life in Knoxville separate from New York, but this gave me an opportunity to integrate them,” she continued. She also wanted to share the sound of the high-fidelity stereo system she had custom built for the project with Knoxville. The specific technology used in the system is often only experienced in professional recording studios. “It's a real gate-kept art form,” Walton said. “I wanted to create a moment in Knoxville where the people of this community got a chance to be with equipment they otherwise wouldn't have access to — to just sit and listen, and present intimacy in an important way, in an inner-city community that, from my personal experience, isn't confronted with that kind of space often. “It was an honor, and it set an incredible standard for how I want to release my work going forward."" The event also featured a live discussion and Q&A with Lee and Yusuf Hassan of Black Mass Publishing, which published Lee's book. The sweetest agony of life Walton set out to examine how love, in all its forms, transforms us. Here's what she learned about the universally experienced emotion: “I learned it's one of the sweetest agonies in life. I learned my desire has intangible depths. I learned I can be honest about what I want - but also accept the things I cannot expect out of one human. I learned that a mask is a terrible thing to unknowingly hide behind.” The “Landscapes of the Mind” debut at Beck was featured in Essence and W magazines. Walton told W that the Knoxville showcase gave her the confidence to present the project in other areas, including in her current home state, New York. Walton has written a second book she plans to publish, too, according to W. Devarrick Turner is a trending news reporter. Email devarrick.turner@knoxnews.com.

Ele deu algumas das atuações mais maduras e fundamentadas dos últimos tempos em filmes como Paterson, Silêncio, O Relatório, História de um Casamento, O Último Duelo , e Casa da Gucci . Ele é mais conhecido por interpretar Kylo Ren no Guerra das Estrelas trilogia sequencial. Ele é um artista poderoso que pode se comprometer com qualquer papel que lhe for atribuído e apresentar performances estelares e memoráveis. Como muitos atores, Driver teve seus dias de teste em que tentou conseguir shows de atuação e estava constantemente tentando provar seu valor para as pessoas. Mas Driver tinha uma mentalidade e uma perspectiva únicas com as quais participou de seus testes, o que o ajudou a enfrentar rejeições e passar rapidamente para outras coisas. Leia também: Adam Driver quase disse não a Kylo Ren de Star Wars devido a uma série de Judd Apatow Adam Driver tinha uma mentalidade deliberadamente cínica enquanto fazia testes Adão Motorista , como muitos atores, teve que encontrar seu caminho na indústria passando por inúmeras audições e esperando ser notado por pessoas com poder e autoridade. Ele tinha uma maneira particularmente cínica de fazer um teste, o que acabou sendo benéfico para ele se as coisas não dessem certo. Ele disse WWD , “Eu me treinei, sempre que entro em testes, para odiar todos na sala. Dessa forma, se não der certo, posso pensar: 'De qualquer maneira, eu não gostava daquelas pessoas!'” A abordagem de Driver para os testes é uma maneira genuinamente saudável de lidar com qualquer tipo de rejeição que os atores geralmente enfrentam durante os testes para shows. Mais tarde, ele impressionou criadores como Lena Dunham, que lhe deu seu primeiro papel importante como Adam Sackler em Garotas . Ele agora se tornou um dos atores mais requisitados da geração atual. Leia também: Adam Driver foi ao extremo para Martin Scorsese, passou por uma transformação alarmante para atender às demandas do roteiro Adam Driver criticou recentemente grandes estúdios por causa das greves de Hollywood Adam Driver estreou recentemente seu filme Ferrari no Festival de Cinema de Veneza de 2023. Na coletiva de imprensa do filme, Driver comentou as greves de Hollywood e criticou grandes estúdios como Netflix e Amazon por não perceberem o significado das demandas do sindicato SAG-AFTRA. Ele disse (através O repórter de Hollywood ), “Estou muito feliz por estar aqui para apoiar este filme, mas também estou muito orgulhoso de estar aqui, de ser uma representação visual de um filme que não faz parte do AMPTP, e de promover a diretriz de liderança do SAG – que é uma tática eficaz – que é o acordo provisório. Por que é que uma pequena empresa de distribuição como a Neon e a STX International da [Ferrari] pode satisfazer as exigências dos sonhos que a [SAG] está a pedir… mas uma grande empresa como a Netflix e a Amazon não pode? Isso apenas torna mais óbvio que essas pessoas estão dispostas a apoiar as pessoas com quem colaboram, e as outras não.” Na frente de trabalho, o filme biográfico de drama esportivo de Driver Ferrari está programado para ser lançado nos cinemas em 25 de dezembro de 2023. Ele também deve liderar o épico de ficção científica de Francis Ford Coppola Megalópole, ao lado de Forest Whitaker, Nathalie Emmanuel, Jon Voight, Laurence Fishburne, Aubrey Plaza, Shia LaBeouf e Giancarlo Esposito.

Specifications: Brand: Hermes Weight: 75 ml Volume: 2.5 Fluid Ounces Scent: Scented 05 How to Make Luxury Perfume Last Longer? To make your luxury perfume last longer, start by applying it to clean, moisturised skin. Hydrated skin acts as a better canvas, holding the scent for extended periods. Next, keep the focus on pulse points like wrists, neck, behind ears, and inner elbows, where body heat helps diffuse the fragrance throughout the day. And the most important, avoid rubbing your wrists together after application, as this can break down the delicate scent molecules. Consider layering your fragrance by using matching scented body products like lotions or shower gels. You can also lightly spritz perfume onto your hairbrush and comb it through your hair, as hair strands can retain scent well. Finally, proper storage is crucial: keep your perfumes in a cool, dark place away from direct sunlight and humidity, which can degrade the fragrance over time. Choosing an Eau de Parfum (EDP) over an Eau de Toilette (EDT) or Cologne will also provide better longevity due to its higher fragrance oil concentration...."

Più che la London Fashion Week, a dettare tendenza in fatto di stile e outfit in Gran Bretagna è un altro evento, attesissimo e sempre molto affollato. Il Festival di Glastonbury 2025, non a caso, è stato ancora una volta sinonimo di un'estetica ben riconoscibile e intramontabile. Mentre gli occhi del mondo erano puntati su Venezia e sul faraonico matrimonio Bezos-Sanchez, nella fresca campagna del Somerset andava in scena un altro tipo di show. Più discreto e sofisticato, ma non meno d'effetto. Tra stivaletti della pioggia, giacche antivento e abiti ultra femminili, il guardaroba di Glastonbury 2025 si conferma tanto attuale quanto d'ispirazione anni Novanta e Duemila. Parola di star. Margot Robbie, biker e sportiva Tra le tante star accorse al celeberrimo festival inglese, spicca l'attrice e produttrice australiana. Dopo la gravidanza, infatti, Margot Robbie è tornata in grande stile. Protagonista di un talk, Robbie ha optato per un mini dress dal design sportivo firmato Miu Miu, contraddistinto da un inaspettato dettaglio cut out sulla schiena. Completavano il look un paio di stivali in stile biker con tanto di fibbia metallica e una giacca di jeans legata in vita. Il risultato finale, grintoso e femminile, è perfetto da replicare in vista dei prossimi concerti estivi.

La battaglia contro l'imprevedibile meteo inglese – e l'inevitabile fango – può essere dunque condotta in grande stile. Lo sa bene Daisy Edgar-Jones, che in questa edizione ha sfoggiato un leggero abito in lino con spalline sottili. Oltre ai rain boots, il look era completato da una mini bag di Gucci in rafia e pelle, per un gradito tocco estivo.

La candidata al Premio Oscar per A Complete Unknown, infatti, si è distinta grazie ad un maxi abito con schiena scoperta, illuminato da una collana con pendente argentato. La borsa hobo in suede e gli stivali alti in pelle, poi, rendevano il look contemporaneo e chic. Grazie alla collaborazione con la stylist Dani Michelle, Barbaro si sta velocemente affermando come un'icona di stile da tenere d'occhio.

Si colloca in bilico tra passato e presente, per l'appunto, l'outfit indossato dalla modella inglese Mia Regan.

Athleticwear brand Lululemon (LULU) sued wholesale chain Costco (COST) on Friday for allegedly copying its designs, according to a Reuters report. The lawsuit, filed in a California federal court, alleges that Costco's ""dupes"" infringe upon Lululemon's patent and trademark rights in its clothing designs and are likely to cause confusion among potential customers. Costco's label Kirkland copies Lululemon's Scuba hoodies, Define jackets, and ABC pants, according to the suit. It cited reports in The New York Times and The Washington Post, calling Costco's products ""dupes"" of Lululemon's, and stated that the similar designs could confuse buyers into thinking that Lululemon had made them for Costco's private label. According to the Reuters report, Lululemon requested an unspecified amount of monetary damages and a court order forcing Costco to stop selling the clothes. The news had little bearing on the retail sentiment of stocks of both companies. As of early Monday, the sentiment was 'bearish' for both Lululemon and Costco. Among the most notable cases, the now-bankrupt Forever 21 faced and settled lawsuits from Puma and Gucci over design copying. More recently, Nike secured a settlement against BAPE, forcing the sneaker brand to halt production of styles that closely resembled its iconic Air Force 1 and Jordan 1 models.

tw_sl_de18bde43792c61dab5d0a1de4baecdd,2025-06-30 12:33:36,en,WEB,"  A Heartfelt Tribute to his grandmother, Jacquemus returned to the enchanting grounds of Versailles with “Le Paysan,” a collection that resonates deeply with the personal journey of Simon Porte Jacquemus and his cherished memories of childhood in the South of France. Set in the Orangerie, once a nurturing home to the palace's fruit trees, this venue symbolizes the beauty of simplicity meeting refinement. Fashion that connects to our human emotions often carries with it stories that touch the heart, and European designers, known for their emotional craftsmanship, excel at this. As Simone Porte Jacquemus unveiled his Spring-Summer 2026 menswear collection, there was an overwhelming warmth intertwined with nostalgia. “Le Paysan” was nothing short of breathtaking, showcasing exquisite tailoring and designs that deeply moved us. Every detail—the craftsmanship, the storytelling, the visual experience—was meticulously curated, encapsulating the essence of who he is. Get Ready for a '20s Hair Revival: Finger Waves & Kiss Curls Are Back! In this collection, Jacquemus elegantly revisits early silhouettes with newfound precision, creating a personal narrative that beautifully illustrates how beauty can originate in humble fields and eventually grace the opulence of Versailles. The voluminous poplin skirts, corseted jackets, linens reminiscent of vintage tablecloths, and sun-faded Provençal menswear all echoed with a sense of comfort and familiarity. The color palette was gentle and nostalgic, featuring soft creams, blacks, and pastels that evoke sweet memories. Dior's Plot Twist Under Jonathan Anderson. Craftsmanship took center stage, highlighted by intricate details such as 700 meters of bobbin tulle, shimmering silk taffeta diamonds, and delicately sculpted leather tassels. Accessories added a playful yet heartfelt touch, with lovingly crafted grosgrain-wrapped espadrilles, charming rosemary bags, and whimsical jewelry shaped like vegetables and sweets. Through this collection, Jacquemus invites us to reflect on our own roots, celebrating the emotional connections that make us who we are. Jacquemus SS26 (Photo Credits: File Image) Another remarkable story comes from the talented Italian designer Alessandra Facchinetti, who poured her heart into a fashion collection inspired by a poignant letter to her father, Andrea Buccellati, during his challenging battle with illness. This touching collection, named ""Romanza,"" was unveiled in 2013, reflecting the deep love and concern she felt for her father. Facchinetti, known for her work with prestigious brands like Gucci and Valentino, used ""Romanza"" as a heartfelt tribute, weaving her emotions into every detail of the designs. The collection served as a powerful medium for Facchinetti to connect with her father, allowing her to express her feelings in a deeply personal way through her artistry. Young designers, like Simon, also embody this spirit of inspiration and emotion in their work. The show resonated profoundly, leaving many in tears and feeling a genuine connection, even from behind a laptop screen. The essence of the brand and its heartfelt message shone through in a way that was simply perfect—flawless in its presentation. These creations allow us to relate to the garments personally by telling childhood stories that linger in the corners of our hearts, creating a tapestry of shared experiences and emotions. What a truly heartwarming way to wrap up the season this week. It's moments like these that remind us of the love and togetherness that bring us joy above all the work, fashion and play… (The above story first appeared on LatestLY on Jun 30, 2025 06:02 PM IST.

mov_307D02DC1C41B527468CB3B09C949C7B,2025-06-30 12:34:55,en,WEB,"  Pop CulturePop CultureFrom Fenway Park to an elevator in the Meatpacking District to the sets of 'Fast & Furious,' beef has been everywhere over the past 25 years. These are the ones that burned the brightest. /Ringer illustrationBy The Ringer StaffJune 30, 10:20 am UTC • 42 min Welcome to Beef Week! Over the next four days, The Ringer will continue its retrospective exploration of the past 25 years by delving into one of the quarter century's defining features: delightfully petty feuds. When the feud between Drake and Kendrick Lamar popped off in May of 2024, many things became clear: that there was not a Big Three but simply a big me, that a not insignificant amount of people were just waiting for a reason to pile on Aubrey Graham, and that in a rap battle, nothing is But what was most obvious was one universal truth: We love mess. There are myriad reasons we attach ourselves to public figures and track their daily lives with the same attention and passion that we do our favorite TV shows, movies, and sports teams. And there may be no celebrity interaction more purely entertaining than two of them beefing. Think about it: all of the excitement and none of the personal hazard. Just two very famous people who have broken out into a fight that you can watch along with like it's a scene from The Real Housewives. And they don't have stats for this sort of thing, but it feels accurate to say that the 21st century has been a banner century for beef. From Fenway Park to an elevator in the Meatpacking District to the sets of Fast & Furious, beef has been everywhere over the past 25 years. In The Ringer's quest to survey the past quarter century, we've broken down the best sports moments and analyzed the millennial generation—call us dramatic, but it feels right to now turn our attention to another defining feature of the 21st century: beef. In putting together this list of the best of the 21st century, we did not adhere to a strict rubric, but certain things were measured—the fierceness of the conflagration, the entertainment factor, the endurance of the disdain, and the pop culture impact—to come to an overall evaluation. We also defined beef as a feud that is (mostly) harmless—just good old-fashioned hateration between two parties. (As an example, Justin Baldoni and Blake Lively are not beefing—they are in the middle of a legal dispute.) Sports beefs were also open for consideration, but to qualify, the beefs had to transcend sheer competitiveness—hate, on the field and off of it, had to be present. You may find some mild exceptions to these rules in the list below, but that's simply because beef is nuanced and incapable of fitting nicely into a box. You may also disagree with our rankings. And if you do, well, guess what. I guess we've got beef now. —Andrew Gruttadaro God, if only Don't Worry Darling's plot had half the intrigue, stakes, and spitting as Don't Worry Darling's press tour. As promotion for the movie ramped up, it gradually became clear, to the delight of rumormongers everywhere, that there'd been some kind of trouble in Palm Springs between the movie's director Olivia Wilde and star Florence Pugh. Pugh made only limited appearances to support DWD, supposedly because she was filming her (awfully small!) role in Dune: Part Two. There was also that time Shia LaBeouf leaked a screenshot of Wilde calling Pugh “Miss Flo” and making the actress out to be a diva for, apparently, not wanting to work with him (she would have had her reasons!) . Rumors leaked saying that Pugh had basically stepped in to direct the movie herself after Wilde was distracted by her budding romance with fellow DWD castmate Harry Styles (Pugh did credit pretty much everyone except Wilde for getting the movie done, so maybe there's something to that scuttlebutt). One source said Wilde and Pugh got into a “screaming match” on set. And there were reports that noted non-actor Styles had made three times as much as Pugh, an Oscar nominee and the real star of the movie. A picture came together of a star and director with dueling visions of the supposedly feminist allegory, and with pretty different ideas of how to comport yourself with your coworkers. Who won the beef? The crowning moment of the Wilde-Pugh beef came at the Venice Film Festival, where Miss Flo stepped off the boat in a regal (but playful!) shade of purple (with an Aperol spritz in tow), conquered the red carpet, and didn't show up to the press conference to support the heatstroked vision of incel utopia she'd deigned to star in. She did say, however, that it's “inspiring” to “see a woman push back and say 'no,' on and off camera.” She won everyone over (not that she'd ever lost us), and she kept Wilde at arm's length the whole time. She also kept her distance from spitgate, a mercy for another one of her iconic fits, a celestial Gucci gown. —Helena Hunt What to do when the world's richest man and the world's most powerful man crash out over each other on social media? Shake your head, mutter some profanities under your breath, and say to yourself, for at least the 642nd time in the past year alone, “We live in an episode of Black Mirror.” No one saw the spectacular fallout between Donald Trump and Elon Musk coming, and everyone saw the spectacular fallout between Donald Trump and Elon Musk coming. (Well, we might not have predicted that tweet about the Epstein files—WTF.) After a bromance between the two rapidly blossomed on the campaign trail leading up to the 2024 election, Musk and Trump went their separate ways less than six months later. Musk, who was appointed head of the newly formed Department of Government Efficiency, took issue with a spending bill championed by Trump, which Musk felt would greatly increase the federal deficit—the complete opposite mission of his agency—and both of them handled it like total adults. This beef ended rather quickly—just about a week after it began, Musk apologized for his very public criticism of Trump—but for about 72 hours, at least, it was a sight to behold. Who won this beef? Please don't make me answer this question. You don't want me to answer this question. But if I must: Trump seems fairly busy and unbothered, while Musk, the apologizer, seems more like a sad loser tweeting through the pain...."

mov_7A7AC34431F4461825911AD50D8AD2F5,2025-06-30 14:01:07,en,WEB,"  Sometimes, a trend comes across our desk that takes its time to cement itself in the public consciousness and read as wearable. We've noticed the rise of the silk scarf, with Gucci's silk-heavy relaunch amid creative-director changes plus lots of great tops and head-wrapping moments. But now, a handful of our favorite girls — all British, no less — are here to convince us on the silk scarf being worn anywhere but your neck this summer. We first spotted Alexa Chung traipsing through London in a casual getup, made ever more exciting with the addition of a scarf belt slung low across her hips. Daisy Edgar-Jones followed suit in a top actually designed to be one, not merely a scarf tied 'round her back (also Gucci), but the hero of our hearts and the trend is Charli XCX (who's surprised?) . For her Glastonbury set, she wore a custom McQueen draped silk scarf top with a few more skull scarves (they're officially back) tacked on the back to great strutting-in-the-Worthy-Farm-wind effect. It was simple, effective, and a genius move on her stylist's part to lean into the Y2Chaos of it all while honoring fashion's favorite Englishman. Charli made it punk, Alexa turned it realistic street, Daisy made it vacation-ready, and all gave us some tips to walk away with as we try it out ourselves. For the club, try wrapping a scarf halter-neck style around your torso and pinning an additional scarf at the back: Not only will the photo op make up for the handiwork, but it'll set you apart from just wearing one handkerchief around your midsection. And as a casual belting moment, it's worth digging through vintage bins to find an oversized moment that will handily wrap around your low waist. I personally paired a Louis Vuitton oversized cream-and-neon carré (it's cooler than it sounds) over denim shorts and a white tank for Pride, and not only did it feel instantly elevated, it provided some intrigue and kept my shorts in place. Utility, meet trendiness and styling."
mov_FFF5E5BB6488F42D279562CD9CD62016,2025-06-30 14:08:10,en,WEB,"  A quadriplegic, designer-clad immigrant on 24-hour NDIS care at his million-dollar waterfront unit has been charged with multiple counts of molesting his female carers. Sohail Aleem Qureshi faces seven charges of sexual assault at his home on the Gold Coast's Hope Island where he stockpiles expensive Gucci, Louis Vuitton and Ralph Lauren goods. Queensland Police have also charged him with one count of fraud, dishonestly gaining benefit/advantage and one of common assault. Despite his disability, Qureshi is accused of assaulting female NDIS contractors during their shifts. Qureshi's condition is described as an 'incomplete quadriplegic' and he retains some restricted movement in his limbs that allows him to still stand unsteadily. While Qureshi was said to have swollen feet and ankles, he required the care workers to 'massage his groin [to help his circulation] because he sits for long times'. Qureshi bragged to his carers that he was a 'very important person' and 'a king of Pakistan' who had 'lots of money and luxury cars, including a Lamborghini', they told Daily Mail Australia. However, Daily Mail Australia understands he is actually a former taxi driver in the US, where he previously lived, and still speaks with an American accent. His charges relate to alleged incidents going back to 2002, after his US-based wife Josephine recruited NDIS workers to care for him at the Gold Coast apartment. The workers made contact with Ms Qureshi via online hiring platforms and were interviewed by her over Skype from her home in Chicago while they attended his unit in person. A female international student revealed Qureshi's wife also boasted about their past moneyed lifestyle, and described her husband's 'cool, expensive wheelchair'. 'Qureshi said he was very rich and had led a rich life in New York,' she said. The carers revealed Qureshi said how much he hated Australia, but loved the NDIS funding he was being given. It is believed Qureshi was disabled by a fall in Brisbane more than four years ago which injured his spine. He started to learn to walk again while receiving NDIS round-the-clock care. 'He told me that Australia is a ""s*** country"" and that he ""can't wait to leave this country"",' said one. ' But ""the NDIS gives you this funding and 24/7 care and where do you get that?"" ,' she added. One alleged victim claimed the NDIS recipient could move reasonably freely even with his condition, which causes a degree of weakness or paralysis in all four limbs. Despite Qureshi's bragging about his wealthy background, three of his carers told Daily Mail Australia they didn't get paid for their shifts. They say they were told their work hadn't been up to par, they were too inexperienced, and said that the way the NDIS is set up allows for this to happen. Another former NDIS worker, who helped look after Qureshi in 2021, said she got an angry reaction when she complained about not getting paid. She said she found him 'very passive-aggressive' and said the NDIS did nothing to ensure payment, except to the person on the scheme. 'When I didn't get paid, he intimated that it was kind of my fault,' said one carer. 'The problem is the NDIS allows for you not to be paid, so I was owed about $1000 and never go it.' A male worker said Qureshi told him that 'he didn't like certain people among the support workers who came there'. Qureshi declined to comment to Daily Mail Australia on the allegations. The NDIS told Daily Mail Australia the safety of carers was a priority. But it admitted the NDIS cannot help if a worker doesn't get paid and must pursue it through the Commonwealth Ombudsman. 'Worker safety and wellbeing is a key part of delivering quality and safe supports to NDIS participants,' it added in a statement 'NDIS workers have the right to feel safe when they are at work. 'NDIS providers are responsible for providing safe workplaces. This includes identifying and managing risks to worker safety and wellbeing, such as worker-related violence. 'Our regulatory arrangements work alongside other legal requirements that apply to NDIS providers, such as the regulation of workplace matters. 'The NDIS Commission works closely with other regulators and bodies where matters relate to workplace laws and disability support worker issues, both at a systemic and individual worker level.'"

Email tips@dailymail.com The One Show has been cancelled in a major schedule shake-up as Alex Jones and Roman Kemp step away from their hosting roles. From tonight, June 30, fans of the long-running magazine show will be left without their fix as it's replacement is revealed. A staple of the schedule, The One Show typically airs at 7pm on weeknights but is now off air until the end of July. The programme is taking its usual summer break, allowing Alex, 48, and Roman, 32 time away from the green sofa. The mum-of-three announced the break last Friday as she signed off from the show. Just before the credits rolled, Alex said: 'We are taking a bit of a break for the next four weeks and we'll be back on Monday, 28th July but there's plenty to enjoy like Wimbledon and the Euros.' BBC bosses will use gap in the schedule to dedicate live coverage of The Wimbledon Championships 2025. Last month The One Show was pulled off air to make way for the Royal Horticultural Society (RHS) Chelsea Flower Show. Meanwhile, EastEnders has been ousted from its usual slot as a result of the tournament. The Walford-based soap typically airs Monday to Thursday at 7:30pm directly after The One Show. However, for this week, fans will need to tune over to BBC Two to catch their latest fix, or watch on iPlayer. Alex Jones previously revealed the Hollywood A-lister who was 'so full of himself' on The One Show. The presenter shared on the Netmums Podcast that actor Jared Leto, 53, was her least favourite guest to ever appear on the BBC show. Jared was interviewed on the chat show in April 2022 to discuss his miniseries, WeCrashed. She told hosts Wendy Golledge and Alison Perry: 'Jared Leto was dressed as one of the Three Musketeers and he had all this, I don't know, Gucci, big shirt, sleeves billowing. I mean, he was so full of himself. 'And I thought, no, no, no, no. Our audience are nice people and, they deserve better than this. And, ok, you might be like a huge celebrity star and you've done all these films, but it doesn't cost to be polite and nice. 'Anybody who can't bring those simple skills to the table, I'm out. I'm like, no, sorry, you've not been brought up well, then.' She added: 'People assume that, it must be amazing to have these big Hollywood actors and yeah, it is. It's fine. But I really like when we have British homegrown talent. They know the show, they know the atmosphere and, they give really good interviews as a result. 'We've had people on that are big Hollywood stars. Last week we had Robert De Niro and, he was lovely. He was a little bit like, ""oh, my God, this is live."" And that's the thing about actors, they don't like being themselves. They often get quite nervous. 'There are some who are brilliant, and they are very relaxed, but when they have to promote the film, they get into a panic, and the interview can be a little bit sort of staccato and it doesn't really flow.'"

mov_A6773694E3C8AB484694D6BACE3B2DF3,2025-06-30 14:46:09,en,WEB,"  Italian luxury fashion label Prada has said it acknowledges the Indian roots of its new footwear line, days after the design sparked a controversy in India. The sandals, showcased at the Milan Fashion Week last week, had an open-toe braided pattern that closely resembled the traditional Kolhapuri sandals made in the Indian states of Maharashtra and Karnataka. Prada described the sandals as ""leather footwear"" but did not mention its Indian origins, prompting backlash and allegations of cultural appropriation in India. Responding to the controversy, Prada told the BBC in a statement that it recognises that the sandals are inspired by traditional Indian footwear. A Prada spokesperson said that the company has ""always celebrated craftsmanship, heritage and design traditions"", adding that it was ""in contact with the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture on this topic"". This is a prominent industry trade body in the state. Last week, its chief had written to the brand, saying the design was commercialised without crediting the artisans who have preserved its heritage for generations. Lorenzo Bertelli, Prada's head of Corporate Social Responsibility, responded to his letter saying that the sandals were ""at an early stage of design"", according to Reuters. He also said that Prada was open to a ""dialogue for meaningful exchange with local Indian artisans"" and the company would organise follow-up meetings to discuss this further. Named after a city in Maharashtra where they are made, Kolhapuri sandals trace their roots back to the 12th Century. Made from leather and sometimes dyed in natural colours, the traditional handcrafted sandals are sturdy and well-suited to India's hot climate. They were awarded the Geographical Indication (GI) status by the Indian government in 2019. According to the World Trade Organisation, a geographical indication tag credits a good or product as having originated from a certain region or place, and is considered a mark of authenticity. Following the controversy, many artisans in Kolhapur said they were saddened by Prada's use of the design without giving due credit. ""These sandals are made with the hard work of leather workers in Kolhapur. They should be named after Kolhapur. Don't take advantage of others' labour,"" Prabha Satpute, a Kolhapuri artisan, told BBC Marathi. The sandals cost a few hundreds rupees in India but Prada's reported premium pricing angered some, though the brand's website does not mention the price tag. Most other sandals sold by the fashion house, retail at between £600 to £1,000 in the UK. Industrialist Harsh Goenka highlighted this, saying the local artisans barely make any money for the same hand-made products. ""They lose, while global brands cash in on our culture,"" he said. This is not the first time that global brands have been accused to appropriating Indian traditional products without crediting their roots. At the 2025 Cannes Film Festival, Gucci described a sari worn by Bollywood star Alia Bhatt as a gown, sparking backlash. Earlier in May, a popular TikTok trend was criticised for calling dupatta, a traditional South Asian scarf, a Scandinavian scarf. In Kolhapur, however, some said the move had instilled a sense of pride in them. ""Artisans are happy that someone is recognising their work,"" Kolhapur-based businessman Dileep More told Reuters."

Produced by Ave Songsmith, the track seamlessly fuses the infectious rhythms of Amapiano with the rich folk sounds of Mbaqanga, creating a unique and captivating sonic experience. The collaboration features artists who are making significant waves in South African music: TBO, known for his success with Zee Nxumalo on ""Ngisakuthanda""; Mawhoo, who has been on an undeniable run with hits like ""Gucci""; and Ntsika of The Soil, currently touring their latest album ""Reimagined."" ""Sono Sam"" delves into the complexities of modern relationships, exploring the delicate balance between love and personal freedom. The song tells the story of a man who envisions a lifelong partnership, but comes to realize that he must evolve and shed outdated perspectives to fully embrace his partner's independence and build a fulfilling life together. TBO's signature hook immediately grabs the listener's attention, while Mawhoo's sultry vocals add depth and emotion to the narrative. Ntsika's exceptional songwriting prowess shines through in the song's poignant lyrics, which resonate with anyone navigating the challenges of love and growth. Ave Songsmith's innovative production elevates ""Sono Sam"" to new heights, seamlessly blending traditional South African sounds with modern Amapiano vibes.

But the truth is, when it comes to manicures and pedicures, you can throw the rule book out of the window. Especially in summer, when anything goes! Summer is, after all, a time for adventure, even if it's just having fun with new colours and nail designs. We're talking bright and vibrant shades like mustard yellow, bright reds, neon orange and light-refracting chrome. For minimalists, creamy neutrals and classic pinks will still make your nails pop. Or, simply keep going with your winter favourites if you're particularly attached to the deep and dark shades. Here are the 12 summer nail colours the professionals predict big things for this summer. 1. Tomato red Are we gearing up for another tomato girl summer? According to celebrity nail artist and founder of the eponymous nail polish brand, Jin Soon Choi, we might be. “I adore the hot orange-red shade with a translucent finish,” Choi says. “It's vibrant and lively, capturing the essence of summer like nothing else.” To capture the true essence of tomato, look for a red with an orange tint to it – this is what immediately brings to mind the punchy ripeness of a fresh summer tomato. Chanel Le Vernis Nail Colour Incendiare Hermès Les Mains Hermès Nail Enamel 39 Orange Poppy 2. Lilac jelly Korean jelly nails were big this spring, and manicurist Julie Kandalec is predicting that the appetite will continue all through the summer season. While any colour goes well with the translucent, juicy look of these nails, she suggests something like a pretty pastel lilac (à la Hailey Bieber at Coachella) for your summer nail look. The best way to get jelly nails at home is to use Korean gel polish, like the GAOY Jelly Gel Nail Polish Kit. But you can use a top coat to help get you that translucent effect, like the O.P.I. Gel Plump Effect Volumizing Top Coat – simply mix it with your main base colour. O.P.I. Gel Plump Effect Top Coat Nails Inc. Jel Oh Jel Jelly Effect Nail Polish 3. Coffee club For mani minimalists, neutral nails are your North star. Chanel nail artist Betina Goldstein loves the Chanel Le Vernis Longwear Nail Colour Particulière, a latte brown that, thanks to its rich creamy colour, will go with any look. If you want something a bit deeper with warm undertones, we like Palette London Toasted Taupe Nail Paint. For something deeper and more mocha-coded, try Nails Inc. Caught in The Nude Nail Polish in shade Hawaii Beach. Nails Inc. Caught in The Nude Nail Polish Hawaii Beach Palette Toasted Taupe Nail Paint 4. Off-white You can't go too far wrong with classic white. “[White nails are] perfect to rock from winter to summer, as they go with everything and still feel so minimal, yet fresh,” says celebrity nail artist Queenie Nguyen. She recommends trying an off-white shade for something a bit more unexpected. Essie Nail Polish 8 Limo Scene 5. Pistachio green Bright and cheerful, pistachio green is the perfect colour to get you in the mood for all of your warm weather adventures. “[It's] a really fun shade that's a bit unexpected yet fresh,” Kandalec says. We like Manicurist Paris's Pistachio Green, or O.P.I.'s The Pass Is Always Greener. Manicurist Green Nail Polish Pistachio Manicurist Nail Polish Artichoke 6...."

mov_0363BB1669775F415CF5597AC957F8D1,2025-06-30 16:01:54,en,WEB,"  NEW YORK — Jury deliberations have begun in the trial of Sean “Diddy” Combs, the music producer turned modern-day Gatsby whose federal racketeering and sex-trafficking case has drawn global attention since it began on May 12. Combs, 55, faces one count of racketeering conspiracy, two counts of sex trafficking by force, fraud or coercion and two counts of transportation to engage in prostitution. If convicted on the most serious of these charges, he faces a maximum sentence of life in prison. Outside the courtroom, the trial became a global source of fascination, with the courthouse swarmed by tourists and TikTokers, survivors of sexual abuse and “Free Puff” proponents. The proceedings were crashed by a heckler and Ye, the rapper formerly known as Kanye West. Combs's mother, Janice, and his adult children maintained a steady show of support. In closing arguments, prosecutors argued that Combs was a man who “would not take no for an answer,” relying on power, violence, fear and an inner circle of employees to carry out alleged crimes. To be found guilty of racketeering conspiracy, Judge Arun Subramanian said Combs needed to conspire to commit two illegal acts from a list of eight categories, including distributing drugs for his many “freak-off” parties. Two former girlfriends of Combs, Casandra “Cassie” Ventura and a single mother testifying under the court-approved alias “Jane,” claimed they were coerced into having sex with male escorts and plied with drugs at these parties, which were sometimes filmed. Ventura, Jane and the escorts were willing participants in these meticulously organized sexual activities, the defense team argued. Lead defense attorney Marc Agnifilo said in his closing arguments that prosecutors overreached by applying racketeering conspiracy, “one of the most serious, complicated, comprehensive statutes on the books,” to what was essentially “personal-use drugs and threesomes.” Beyond the specific charges in the case, certain themes have emerged from 28 days of testimony. Here's what to know: Endless sexting, flight bookings, hotel arrangements, candles, baby oil, drugs, meals. Testimony and evidence shown ad nauseam at this trial reveal just how extraordinary and involved Sean “Diddy” Combs's sex life was and how central it was to his existence. Combs and his staff prepared extensively for his freak-offs — which sometimes took the hip-hop mogul away from his regular life for days at a time. Planning these encounters was a group effort, requiring Combs, his staff and his girlfriends to book male escorts, procure drugs and stock up hotel rooms to ensure Combs would be happy and undisturbed for the duration. Prosecutors revealed that federal agents found around 900 bottles of lubricant in his Los Angeles mansion alone, and that he had freak-off supplies in his hotel room when he was arrested in New York in September. All of it points to a person completely preoccupied with a particular sexual fantasy and the women who would play their part in it. The defense has characterized Combs as a swinger, voyeur and homemade porn enthusiast. “I'm under the impression this is a popular thing nowadays,” Combs's lawyer Agnifilo said during closing arguments. Both Ventura and Jane said they followed a freak-off “script” laid out by the hip-hop impresario, who they say gave them drugs such as ecstasy and GHB, which made them more compliant while also keeping them awake. Both testified that a freak-off wouldn't end until Combs decided. Both told Combs they found the experiences degrading and shameful, but they said they ultimately felt compelled to participate because of the love they felt for him — and the specific ways he manipulated them. More in U.S. Ventura alleged years of brutal physical abuse surrounding the freak-offs. Jane said Combs discouraged her from using condoms with men she had sex with and alleged that Combs once forced her to perform oral sex on a man immediately after a physical fight in which he gave her a black eye and welts. Some aspects of their stories feel novel, even challenging, when compared with traditional notions of sex trafficking and its imagery of desperate, vulnerable women unwittingly ending up in isolated sexual servitude while trying to escape poverty or war-torn countries. Theirs was a world of red carpets, designer bags and yacht trips. Combs's defense pointed out that both women not only expressed enthusiasm for the sex encounters, but seemingly also had the means and opportunity to leave. The jury in Combs's criminal trial will be tasked with picking through these details and deeper issues of intent and consent when determining whether the defendant made these women, through force, fraud or coercion, participate in commercial sexual encounters across two decades. Several witnesses at this trial who were part of Combs's inner circle have expressed a cultlike adoration of the Bad Boy Records founder, crediting him with opening up their worlds and uplifting them. Former assistant George Kaplan described Combs as “a god among men” on the stand — even as he said he was horrified to witness Combs's violence. Others painted a picture of a charismatic figure as capable of breaking people down as he was building them up. Working for Combs meant being available for him at all hours, according to the testimony of his former staff. One former assistant, using court-approved alias “Mia,” said she once had to stay up for five days without sleep. Another former assistant, Capricorn Clark, said she was hooked up to a lie-detector test in a “dilapidated” building for five consecutive days to test her loyalty. “He used to say that he wants us to move like SEAL Team Six,” former assistant Brendan Paul said of his boss's lofty expectations. Combs's duality was especially apparent to his ex-girlfriends. Ventura, who described being a “fan” of his music, recalled how special she felt receiving personal attention from this larger-than-life figure when she was an emerging pop star. But after signing a 10-album contract with Bad Boy Records, Ventura felt Combs stifled her career, forcing her to record “hundreds” of songs that were never released and, ultimately, making marathon-length freak-offs her “job.” During the trial it emerged that Sean “Diddy” Combs paid $100,000 to obtain what he thought was the only copy of a 2016 video showing him beating Ventura in a hotel hallway, according to the testimony of Eddy Garcia, a hotel security worker. When a copy of the original footage was released by CNN last year, it ignited outrage and shifted public opinion. Garcia also testified that he signed a nondisclosure agreement as part of the deal. It was also revealed that Combs paid $20 million to Ventura to settle her explosive 2023 sex-trafficking lawsuit, which spurred federal investigators to begin looking into the music producer. And Ventura's friend Kerry Morgan testified that she was paid $30,000 and signed an NDA after Combs allegedly assaulted her at Ventura's Hollywood Hills home in 2018. Prosecutors also argued that Combs entered into a $10,000 per month “love contract” with Jane after she started pushing back about their “hotel nights,” or freak-offs. Text messages show that when she later brought up the exploitive nature of their relationship, Combs responded by telling her to remember her beautiful home and smile (per his wishes, Combs also paid for her veneers). The sordid repeatedly sidled up to the sumptuous throughout the 28 days of testimony: Combs's drugs supply was kept at the ready in either a Louis Vuitton or Gucci pouch, members of his entourage noted. He had residences in New York, Los Angeles, Miami and the tony en..."

In many Western cultures, guests wearing white to a wedding may be interpreted as rude or inconsiderate because it can be seen as competing with or taking attention away from the bride, who traditionally stands out wearing white to mark her special status.

Heard great things about SS so purchased two 925 Guccis direct off his website. They were about $40 each and $10 postage to the UK. SS was very responsive. I made an error with the sizing but messaged him the same day of ordering and he responded in a couple of hours and rectified it. It took about 7 days from ordering to post and another 14 days to arrive. SS kept me informed throughout the process, with QC pics for me to check and a picture of the parcel label. The wrapping was excellent, with lots of tape to deter opening. As per pics, I used an Amazon brought iron test (which I don't hold much faith in) but it seems to show the 'all clear'. Also as per pics, silver (including 925) shouldn't be magnetic. Again it's not a fool proof test, but the rings are not magnetic, ruling out content like steel. SS assured me they were 925 as advertised and I am content that they are. Overall 10/10. I would post his links...but I have already written this review once before and it was removed for including his linktree."

A possible change of CEO would, if confirmed, pile further pressure on the high-end business which reported a decline in revenues and profit last year. Italian fashion blog ""The platform"" reported on Sunday that the Italian manager, who took the role in 2020, was about to leave the group in order to have more time for himself. Contacted by Reuters, the Rome-based group, controlled by Qatari investment fund Mayhoola, sent a short statement saying the executive was on sick leave, without providing further details. Gucci-owner Kering bought a 30% stake in Valentino in 2023 for $1.7 billion with a commitment to buy the remaining 70% by 2028, hoping to create a second flagship label rooted in high couture. Valentino, which last year named star designer Alessandro Michele as creative director to replace long-serving Pierpaolo Piccioli, reported a 2% drop at constant exchange rates in revenues last year, to 1.31 billion euros ($1.54 billion). Its core profit declined 22% to 246 million euros, with the wider industry facing a demand slowdown and challenging economic backdrop. Michele's new collection, which arrived in stores only in the last quarter of 2024, according to documents registered at the local chamber of commerce, is yet to convince customers, three sources close to the matter said. Valentino's usual customers are not buying much of the collection and new converts have been slow to emerge, the sources said. Valentino wasn't immediately available for a comment about the new collection's performance. Kering's purchasing deal included cross put and call options for Kering, which is struggling to relaunch its main brand Gucci, to purchase the whole of Valentino's share capital from May 2026 through 2028.

mov_5D9EA90993245B53B4C531C423388FE5,2025-06-30 19:08:04,en,WEB,"  Performances by Ayo Edebiri and Jeremy Allen White may be the main dishes on the newly released fourth season of The Bear , but in one episode, there's also a side of art, courtesy the photographer Tyler Mitchell . The fourth episode features two of Mitchell's photographs hanging in the Chicago apartment rented by Syd, Edebiri's character. In one of those pictures, there are multiple shots of a Black man and a Black woman dancing in an empty room. Those photographs were initially shot by Mitchell on commission for Vogue and feature the actors KiKi Layne and Stephan James, who starred together in the Barry Jenkins film If Beale Street Could Talk . Arranged together in grid, the shots form a single work called Untitled (Kiki and Stephan Dancing) . In another photograph, rows of Black girls and boys can be seen hula hooping on a concrete court in Brooklyn. Though it appears to be a documentary photograph, that 2019 picture, Untitled (Group Hula Hoop) , was Mitchell's attempt at adding to “the conversations that I and other black artists around me want to have,” the artist told the Guardian in 2020. “All the pictures propose what our world should look like—if we are allowed all the freedoms we have been historically denied.” A recurrent subject in his work has been intimate moments that might seem minor or unimportant. But in immortalizing these moments, Mitchell intends to make them feel monumental. As Mitchell told painter Amy Sherald in a 2021 conversation for Art in America , he is “out to reclaim these small moments of everyday joy, which is so important because generations before us weren't necessarily able to.” His subject matter is consonant with the focus of this episode of The Bear . Directed by Janicza Bravo, it centers around Syd's attempts to reconnect with her cousin Chantel (Danielle Deadwyler) and her cousin's daughter, TJ (Arion King). Much of the episode is devoted to anything other than the FX on Hulu series' main subject, the cutthroat food industry in Chicago, with a large part of the episode's runtime given over to quotidian conversations about Hamburger Helper and friendship. Before he even turned 30, Mitchell rose to fame for shooting Beyoncé's portrait and has since risen to become one of today's mostly closely watched photographers, working on commission for brands such as Ferragamo, Gucci, and JW Anderson. He is now represented by Gagosian, which is among the biggest galleries in the world. His prices have ascended alongside his fame, with one photograph selling for more than $24,000 at Phillips. For that reason, it's not exactly clear how Syd, an underpaid chef now at the helm of a struggling restaurant, could possibly afford two, let alone one, of Mitchell's photographs. But Mitchell seemed to give The Bear his stamp of approval, posting a screenshot of the episode of his Instagram Story over the weekend with three heart emojis. He did, however, quibble with Sydney's unconventional installation methods, noting the way that she had arranged his two photographs inches away from each other. With a crying emoji, Mitchell added, “Sydney got her framing aesthetics but so be it.”"

The allegations, which most companies have denied, are detailed in a report published by Earthsight, a UK-based nonprofit focused on environmental and injustice investigations. Their findings draw on thousands of records of Brazilian leather exports, data on the cattle sector, court rulings and satellite imagery, as well as interviews and on-the-ground research. ""Consumers probably expect that when buying a luxury product, the high price tag guarantees some level of ethics and sustainability,"" Lara Shirra White, an Earthsight researcher, told DW. ""They don't expect that the leather bag might be linked to deforestation and human rights violations."" The NGO warns of products made from the hides of cattle reared on farms embargoed for environmental violations, including some operating illegally within Para's Apyterewa Indigenous Territory, which was heavily deforested during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro from 2019 to 2022. As part of its research, Earthsight investigated the business operations of Frigol, a Brazilian meatpacking company identified as one of the buyers of cattle raised on the territory. The report says at least 17,000 animals were sold to Frigol between 2020 and 2023, which is ""enough to produce 425 tons of leather."" Researchers linked some of those cattle to illegal farms but said it's not possible to determine the exact number that left Apyterewa, in part because Frigol itself ""does not trace most of its indirect suppliers."" The report says this gap in reporting leaves the company's ""supply chain vulnerable to the widespread practice of 'cattle laundering,'"" in which cows from illegal farms are transferred to legally registered properties before being sold. Paulo Barreto, senior researcher at the Brazilian conservation and sustainable development Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon, Imazon, said control over indirect suppliers is either nonexistent or incomplete. ""As a result, cattle raised in illegally deforested areas end up entering the market as if they were legal. The lack of a transparent public system regarding the origin of the cattle makes control difficult."" Frigol, however, told DW via email that it does not purchase cattle from Indigenous lands and monitors 100% of its direct suppliers. ""We are committed to working together with industry institutions, the production chain and public authorities to make progress,"" the company said in a statement. It added that it believes ""only individual traceability of animals for socio-environmental purposes will make it possible to mitigate deforestation across all links of the cattle supply chain."" Brazilian leather, Italian prestige According to Earthsight's research, after the animals are slaughtered at Frigol's facilities, a percentage of cow skins are exported, in part by the Brazilian leather company Durlicouros, which shipped 14,700 tons of hide to Italy between 2020 and 2023. Some of that, the report found, went to the Italian tanneries Conceria Cristina and Faeda. The research lists high-end names like Coach, Fendi, ChloxE9, Hugo Boss and Saint Laurent among Conceria Cristina's clients. Faeda, meanwhile, provides leather to brands such as Chanel, Balenciaga and Gucci, according to the investigation. In response to a DW request for comment, Chanel cited deforestation as a ""major concern"" and said it no longer works with Faeda due to unmet traceability requirements: ""92% of the calfskin we use is sourced from Europe, and we audit slaughterhouses and farms outside Europe to ensure they are not in deforestation zones."" The Kering Group, which owns Balenciaga, Gucci, and Saint Laurent, told DW that while the two Italian companies mentioned in the report are suppliers, ""the leather they provide to any Kering house does not come from Brazil."" Based on Earthsight's findings, Hugo Boss issued a statement to say it had conducted a detailed review, and could ""confirm that none of the leather"" it is supplied with ""is connected to any of the alleged parties in connection with the investigation."" LVMH, which owns Fendi and Louis Vuitton, said it has a system capable of tracing the origin of 98% of the leather used in its products and that it does not source this from South America. And Tapestry, which owns the Coach brand, wrote to DW saying that while the system for tracking raw materials in Brazil is ""complex and imperfect,"" it is working to be ""part of the solution to improve traceability and transparency."" ChloxE9, Conceria Cristina and Faeda had not responded to a DW request for comment at the time of publication. Flaws in the certification system Durlicouros told DW that it tracks its indirect suppliers and participates in discussions on state and national models for full traceability and compliance. ""In addition, all Durlicouros facilities are certified by the Leather Working Group (LWG), ensuring high standards of sustainability, traceability, and environmental responsibility, according to the purpose of each facility."" But Earthsight researcher Lara Shirra White said companies often use the certification to vouch for the ethics and sustainability of the leather they produce ""instead of conducting meaningful due diligence themselves to ensure their supply chains are deforestation-free."" She said the problem with the LWG, founded in 2005, is that ""it does not require traceability back to the farms,"" and can therefore not account for environmental and human rights abuses in the areas where the cattle are raised. The LWG told DW it is enhancing its ""due diligence requirements related to deforestation and land conversion,"" which will ""include establishing a chain of custody system that would support more detailed traceability across the leather value chain."" Can a shift come via Europe? There is some hope that the European Union's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) could make a contribution to change. Due to come into effect at the end of this year after a 12-month delay, it will ban the purchase of products originating from destroyed forest areas. ""We hope the law will be implemented on schedule, despite certain sectors of the industry still trying, in some way, to exclude leather from the scope of the legislation,"" Rafael Pieroni, a researcher at Earthsight, told DW. However, he said the report also contains a message for the Brazilian government. ""It should implement traceability and make all data public.

DId she do a slow introduction with the new cat and Gucci or did she just throw them together with no warning? Gucci is probably anxious, scared, depressed and feeling dejected. That's such a sad picture of him. It makes me want to cry. Your sister needs to step away from the other cat and focus her attention on Gucci. He should have full access to the home and the other cat needs to be closed off in a room where Gucci cannot see them. You sister needs to sit with Gucci, try to coax him out with treats and tasty food. Play with him with a wand toy. Open up the blinds and give him something to sit on to look outside. That cat tree doesn;t look very sturdy. Someone I know has one like that and it's wobbly and only meant for a kitten and not a grown cat.

The allegations, which most companies have denied, are detailed in a report published by Earthsight, a UK-based nonprofit focused on environmental and injustice investigations. Their findings draw on thousands of records of Brazilian leather exports, data on the cattle sector, court rulings and satellite imagery, as well as interviews and on-the-ground research. ""Consumers probably expect that when buying a luxury product, the high price tag guarantees some level of ethics and sustainability,"" Lara Shirra White, an Earthsight researcher, told DW. ""They dont expect that the leather bag might be linked to deforestation and human rights violations."" The NGO warns of products made from the hides of cattle reared on farms embargoed for environmental violations, including some operating illegally within Paras Apyterewa Indigenous Territory, which was heavily deforested during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro from 2019 to 2022. As part of its research, Earthsight investigated the business operations of Frigol, a Brazilian meatpacking company identified as one of the buyers of cattle raised on the territory. The report says at least 17,000 animals were sold to Frigol between 2020 and 2023, which is ""enough to produce 425 tons of leather.""

wall-229179383_26487,2025-07-01 02:28:21,en,VK,"  Introduction: Comparisons are a fundamental part of our daily lives. We compare everything from products to people, places to experiences, and much more. Comparisons can help us make informed decisions, evaluate options, and understand differences. In this article, we will explore some great comparisons across various fields and industries. Technology Companies One of the most debated comparisons is between technology giants Apple and Microsoft. Apple is known for its sleek design, while Microsoft is known for its reliability and functionality. Both companies have a loyal fan base, and their products have become a staple in the tech industry. Another comparison is between Google and Amazon. Google is known for its search engine and software products, while Amazon is known for its e-commerce platform and cloud computing services. These companies have created innovative products and services that have transformed the tech industry. Sports Teams Sports teams are also a popular subject for comparisons. For example, in basketball, the Los Angeles Lakers and the Boston Celtics are two of the most successful teams in NBA history. The Lakers have won 17 championships, while the Celtics have won 17 as well. In football, the debate between the New England Patriots and the Dallas Cowboys is ongoing. The Patriots have won six Super Bowls, while the Cowboys have won five. The success of these teams has created a heated debate among fans. Food Food is another field where comparisons are common. For instance, pizza and burgers are two popular fast foods that are often compared. Pizza is known for its cheesy and savory taste, while burgers are known for their juicy meat and crispy buns. Another comparison is between coffee and tea. Coffee is known for its rich and bold flavor, while tea is known for its soothing and calming effects. Both of these beverages have a loyal fan base and are enjoyed worldwide. Travel Travel is another area where comparisons are frequent. For example, the debate between a beach vacation and a mountain vacation is ongoing. A beach vacation is known for its relaxing and sunny atmosphere, while a mountain vacation is known for its scenic views and outdoor activities. Another comparison is between traveling solo and traveling in a group. Traveling solo allows for more freedom and flexibility, while traveling in a group can be more social and fun. Fashion Fashion is a field where comparisons are made on a daily basis. For example, the comparison between high-end luxury brands like Chanel and Gucci is ongoing. Chanel is known for its classic and timeless designs, while Gucci is known for its bold and trendy styles. Another comparison is between high heels and flats. High heels are known for their elegance and height, while flats are known for their comfort and versatility. Conclusion: (EDITAPAPER => vk.cc/cMZDnO) Comparisons are an integral part of our daily lives, and they help us make informed decisions and understand differences. From technology companies to sports teams, food to travel, and fashion to entertainment, comparisons are present in every field and industry. By exploring these great comparisons, we can gain a better understanding of the world around us and make more informed choices."
c6eceb817a5ee299e38c670ded74d901,2025-07-01 02:56:00,no,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[no]Annen «En av tingene jeg er mest stolt av...»: Ikke skuespiller, 2-gangers Oscar-nominert Adam Driver vil aldri glemme at han en gang var marinesoldat – hvorfor ble han utskrevet fra korpset? Adam Driver er en av de flinkeste skuespillerne i den nåværende generasjonen som ikke ønsker berømmelse og oppmerksomhet, men er heller fokusert på å gjøre godt arbeid. Han har fått noen av de mest modne og grunnfestede forestillingene i nyere tid med filmer som Paterson, Silence, The Report, Marriage Story, The Last Duel , og House of Gucci . Han er mest anerkjent for å ha spilt Kylo Ren i Stjerne krigen oppfølgertrilogi. Han er en kraftfull utøver som kan forplikte seg til enhver rolle han får og levere fantastiske og minneverdige prestasjoner. Før han ble skuespiller, meldte Driver seg frivillig til å tjene i U.S. Marine Corps etter 2001 9/11-angrepene. Men tiden hans der ble forkortet på grunn av en ulykke. Men Driver er fortsatt veldig stolt over å ha tjenestegjort en tid i militæret og setter det til og med over sin nåværende skuespillerjobb. Les også: 'Hvorfor kan ikke et stort selskap som Netflix og Amazon?' : Star Wars-skuespilleren Adam Driver skammer streaminggigantene for ikke å støtte menneskene de jobber med Adam Driver hevder å være marinesoldat var det stolteste øyeblikket i livet hans Adam sjåfør er nå en ettertraktet skuespiller i Hollywood, på grunn av sin allsidighet og naturlige gave til skuespill. Men før han våget seg inn i skuespillerverdenen, var han tidligere en dedikert og stolt marinesoldat, som han tjenestegjorde i to år og åtte måneder. Men en terrengsykkelulykke avbrøt karrieren hans som marinesoldat, og han ble knust. Han uttrykte at det å være marinesoldat var det stolteste i livet hans under en TED Talk (på YouTube ). Han sa, 'Jeg elsket det, jeg elsket å være marinesoldat. Det er en av tingene jeg er mest stolt av å ha gjort i livet mitt. Jeg elsket Marine Corps mest for det jeg lette etter minst da jeg ble med, som var menneskene. Noen år inn i tjenesten min og måneder unna utplassering til Irak, fikk jeg brystbenet av ledd i en terrengsykkelulykke og måtte separeres medisinsk. Å bli fortalt at jeg ikke ble utplassert til Irak eller Afghanistan var veldig ødeleggende for meg. Og så var jeg plutselig sivil igjen.» Sjåføren snakket også om hvordan han hadde problemer med å tilpasse seg det sivile livet og sa: «Jeg trodde alle sivile problemer var små sammenlignet med militæret. Men jeg ble overrasket over hvor kompleks overgangen var fra militær til sivil. Det var vanskelig, delvis fordi jeg gikk på skuespillerskolen og også fordi jeg ikke visste hvordan jeg skulle bruke det jeg lærte i militæret i en sivil kontekst., både praktisk og følelsesmessig. Jeg slet med å finne mening, i militæret hadde alt mening. I den sivile verden er det ingen rang, du er bare en annen kropp og jeg følte hele tiden at jeg måtte bevise min verdi på nytt.» Driver jobbet hardt og klarte seg i Hollywood på grunn av sitt engasjement og naturlige talent som skuespiller. Hans livshistorie er inspirerende og gir en viktig moral om at alle kan lykkes med hva som helst så lenge de legger sitt hjerte og sjel i det.

mov_D21CAF17E6D88B4C61502E34F9616CDD,2025-07-01 03:51:00,vi,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Với hơn 219.000 mặt hàng giả được thu giữ và tổng giá trị thị trường nếu bán ra tương đương hàng thật lên tới 1,03 tỷ USD, vụ việc được đánh giá là một trong những vụ án hàng giả lớn nhất lịch sử nước Mỹ. Hai nghi phạm, một đế chế hàng giả trị giá tỷ đô Ẩn mình giữa những dãy nhà cao tầng sầm uất của Manhattan, một mạng lưới buôn bán hàng hiệu giả tinh vi đã tồn tại và vận hành âm thầm trong nhiều năm. Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ. Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính. Nó là biểu tượng của một thách thức toàn cầu: khi hàng giả ngày càng tinh vi, thương mại điện tử ngày càng phát triển, và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng ngày càng dễ bị lợi dụng. Mỗi cú nhấp chuột mua hàng mà không kiểm chứng nguồn gốc có thể tiếp tay cho một đường dây tội phạm khổng lồ đang hoạt động ngay giữa lòng đô thị văn minh. Và mỗi vụ án được bóc trần – như đế chế hàng hiệu giả 1 tỷ đô ở Manhattan – là lời nhắc nhở rằng: cuộc chiến chống hàng giả chưa bao giờ đơn giản. Nguồn: Tổng hợp"

mov_FF4881AB674D2F15DFA9581019DA4BC0,2025-07-01 06:50:32,vi,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Hai nghi phạm, một đế chế hàng giả trị giá tỷ đô Ẩn mình giữa những dãy nhà cao tầng sầm uất của Manhattan, một mạng lưới buôn bán hàng hiệu giả tinh vi đã tồn tại và vận hành âm thầm trong nhiều năm. Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ. Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính. Nó là biểu tượng của một thách thức toàn cầu: khi hàng giả ngày càng tinh vi, thương mại điện tử ngày càng phát triển, và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng ngày càng dễ bị lợi dụng. Mỗi cú nhấp chuột mua hàng mà không kiểm chứng nguồn gốc có thể tiếp tay cho một đường dây tội phạm khổng lồ đang hoạt động ngay giữa lòng đô thị văn minh. Và mỗi vụ án được bóc trần – như đế chế hàng hiệu giả 1 tỷ đô ở Manhattan – là lời nhắc nhở rằng: cuộc chiến chống hàng giả chưa bao giờ đơn giản.

Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính.

295ee225fd970e43afc0c6eafae59ece,2025-07-01 07:52:00,vi,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Hai nghi phạm, một đế chế hàng giả trị giá tỷ đô Ẩn mình giữa những dãy nhà cao tầng sầm uất của Manhattan, một mạng lưới buôn bán hàng hiệu giả tinh vi đã tồn tại và vận hành âm thầm trong nhiều năm. Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ.

Essa dupla diretor-ator poderia ter sido uma realidade se as coisas tivessem sido diferentes. Refn define a palavra autor e ele se encaixa no mundo dos filmes independentes, em vez dos grandes estandes de Hollywood. Ele entrou em cena com o clássico cult Dirigir (2011) e depois passou a fazer filmes como Só Deus perdoa (2013) e O Demônio Neon (2016). Mas, como costuma acontecer com qualquer diretor que entra em cena com um filme novo e inovador, Refn também recebeu grandes filmes. Um deles foi o filme James Bond de Daniel Craig, que arrecadou US$ 880 milhões. Espectro . No entanto, o diretor figurão recusou porque sabia que Bond não era para ele. Por que Nicolas Winding Refn se recusou a dirigir o filme de Daniel Craig? Espectro ? Em entrevista ao The Telegraph, Nicolas Winding Refn revelou que estava conversando com os produtores dos filmes de James Bond, Eon Productions, para o filme de Daniel Craig. Espectro . Mas ao longo de várias reuniões, o diretor percebeu que não foi feito para dirigir uma propriedade como James Bond, e seria melhor para ele fazer suas próprias coisas. Ele disse: “Só sei que assim posso fazer o que quiser e isso supera qualquer dinheiro que alguém possa me dar.” consulte Mais informação : “Ei, foda-se”: a primeira interação da estrela de James Bond, Daniel Craig, foi humilhante para a estrela do Batman, Anne Hathaway No entanto, em 2016, ele ainda estava envolvido com o mundo da espionagem porque estava trabalhando com os escritores de James Bond Neal Purvis e Robert Wade em um thriller de espionagem intitulado O Silêncio Vingador . A sinopse dizia: “ Um ex-espião europeu aceita uma missão confidencial de um empresário japonês exilado na França para derrubar o chefe do mais traiçoeiro chefe da Yakuza no Japão.” No entanto, esse filme não viu a luz do dia. Ao longo dos anos, a popularidade do diretor dinamarquês diminuiu, embora ele tenha feito filmes com grandes estrelas como Tom Hardy em Bronson (2008). Então, como ele se sustenta se não assume empregos de direção de sustentação? Naquela época, Refn havia explicado que tudo era graças à direção de comerciais para empresas como Gucci, H&M e muito mais. consulte Mais informação : “Fiquei totalmente chocado e fui chutado para o meio-fio”: ao contrário de Daniel Craig, Pierce Brosnan ficou chateado com a forma como deixou James Bond Quem é o próximo para James Bond? Depois que Nicolas Winding Refn deixou o projeto James Bond, Sam Mendes foi contratado para dirigir Espectro (2015). Mas já se passaram anos desde então e o próximo filme de Bond, Sem Tempo para Morrer (2021), de Cary Fukunaga, viu Daniel Craig sair da popular franquia de espionagem. Desde então, houve intensas especulações sobre quem poderia assumir o manto do espião mais famoso do mundo. nomes como Henry Cavill , Idris Elba, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Tom Hardy e mais foram lançados. Mas não houve nenhuma informação oficial de produtores como Michael G. Wilson e Barbara Broccoli sobre o próximo James Bond. consulte Mais informação : “Estava fora de questão”: Daniel Craig estava pronto para arriscar o salário maciço de US $ 85 milhões de James Bond ao recusar uma grande mudança em sua aparência Quando Broccoli recebeu uma bolsa BFI em 2022, ela foi questionada sobre o próximo filme de Bond e disse: “Estamos trabalhando para onde ir com ele, estamos conversando sobre isso. Não há um roteiro e não podemos criar um até decidirmos como vamos abordar o próximo filme porque, realmente, é uma reinvenção de Bond. Estamos reinventando quem ele é e isso leva tempo. Eu diria que as filmagens são daqui a pelo menos dois anos.” Como tal, parece que o anúncio oficial ainda está a um ano e meio de atraso, pelo menos. Resta saber quem será escolhido, porque será difícil igualar o legado de James Bond e o manto de Daniel Craig. Espectro está disponível no Amazon Prime Vídeo. Fonte : O telégrafo"

mov_4B21061BDA5720BC2CC098036D87F3AC,2025-07-01 10:39:02,vi,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Các sản phẩm túi xách thương hiệu Coach - Ảnh: newsweek.com Một báo cáo gây sốc từ tổ chức phi chính phủ Earthsight của Anh vừa phơi bày một sự thật đau lòng: Đằng sau những chiếc túi xách hàng hiệu xa xỉ của các nhà mốt danh tiếng như Hugo Boss, Chanel hay LVMH là nạn phá rừng bất hợp pháp quy mô lớn tại Amazon - ""lá phổi xanh"" của hành tinh. Tháng 11-2025, Hội nghị lần thứ 30 các Bên tham gia Công ước Khung của Liên Hợp Quốc về Biến đổi khí hậu (COP30) sẽ được tổ chức tại Brazil - quốc gia sở hữu phần lớn rừng Amazon. Đây là lần đầu tiên sự kiện khí hậu trọng đại này chính thức đưa vấn đề rừng nhiệt đới vào chương trình nghị sự, trong bối cảnh các cánh rừng tại Amazon đang đối mặt với nguy cơ bị tàn phá nghiêm trọng bởi nhiều nguyên nhân, từ việc trồng đậu nành, các vụ cháy rừng, cho đến một nguyên nhân gián tiếp ít ai nghĩ đến: Ngành công nghiệp da. Mối liên hệ giữa da thuộc xa xỉ và nạn phá rừng Theo báo cáo của Earthsight, da được sử dụng để chế tác những chiếc túi xách sang trọng bậc nhất lại có nguồn gốc từ hoạt động chăn nuôi gia súc bất hợp pháp tại khu vực Amazon. Điều đáng báo động là chăn nuôi gia súc chính là nguyên nhân hàng đầu gây ra nạn phá rừng quy mô lớn trong những năm gần đây tại vùng đất này. Để làm rõ sự việc, Earthsight đã tiến hành một cuộc điều tra toàn diện, bao gồm phân tích tài liệu pháp lý, dữ liệu thương mại, hình ảnh vệ tinh và thậm chí là điều tra bí mật tại các nhà thuộc da ở Italy. Kết quả cho thấy sự liên đới rõ ràng của nhiều thương hiệu lớn trong chuỗi cung ứng đầy rủi ro này. Báo cáo đặc biệt nhấn mạnh hoạt động chăn nuôi gia súc bất hợp pháp tại bang Pará, phía Bắc Brazil. Tại đây, một khu vực rộng gần gấp đôi diện tích Bồ Đào Nha đã bị thiêu rụi trong vòng 20 năm qua. Sau khi được giết mổ, da của những con gia súc được chuyển đến hai nhà thuộc da của Italy là Conceria Cristina và Faeda. Đáng chú ý, hai nhà thuộc da này là đối tác thường xuyên của các thương hiệu thời trang cao cấp. Những tên tuổi lớn bị điểm mặt Coach, thương hiệu thời trang Mỹ nổi tiếng với những chiếc túi xách sang trọng ""dễ tiếp cận"", có giá bán từ 300-600 euro (350,42 - 700,84 USD) và đang hướng đến thế hệ trẻ, được xác định là một trong những khách hàng của hai nhà thuộc da trên. Không chỉ Coach, Earthsight còn điểm mặt nhiều thương hiệu danh tiếng khác cũng mua da từ Conceria Cristina và Faeda, bao gồm: Chanel, Chloé, Hugo Boss, Fendi và Louis Vuitton (thuộc tập đoàn LVMH), cùng với Balenciaga, Gucci và Saint Laurent (thuộc tập đoàn Kering). Mặc dù tất cả các thương hiệu trên đều phủ nhận việc sử dụng da từ Brazil, nhưng sau khi nhận thông báo về cuộc điều tra, một số đã nhanh chóng khởi động các cuộc điều tra nội bộ, trong khi số khác cung cấp thông tin về nguồn gốc da của họ cho Earthsight. Điều đáng nói, trong khi các cuộc điều tra đang diễn ra, ngành công nghiệp da vẫn tiếp tục vận động hành lang nhằm thoát khỏi các quy định bảo vệ rừng mới của châu Âu, dự kiến có hiệu lực vào cuối năm nay. Thậm chí, một sự kiện đã được tổ chức tại Nghị viện châu Âu (EP) để thúc đẩy lợi ích của họ. Lời kêu gọi hành động Ông Rafael Pieroni, Trưởng nhóm Mỹ Latinh của Earthsight, thẳng thắn bày tỏ sự thất vọng: ""Người tiêu dùng các sản phẩm xa xỉ thường kỳ vọng rằng mức giá cao sẽ đảm bảo họ không góp phần vào nạn phá rừng hay việc chiếm đoạt đất của người bản địa. Cuộc điều tra này cho thấy niềm tin đó đang bị đặt sai chỗ. Chừng nào các thương hiệu thời trang chưa thực hiện đầy đủ trách nhiệm rà soát chuỗi cung ứng của mình, họ sẽ không thể đảm bảo rằng sản phẩm của mình không liên quan đến những hành vi lạm dụng này"". Vào tháng 1-2026, Quy định Chống Phá rừng của Liên minh châu Âu (EUDR) sẽ chính thức có hiệu lực, buộc các doanh nghiệp phải chứng minh rằng da và các nguyên liệu thô khác mà họ sử dụng ""không liên quan đến nạn phá rừng"". Bà Marie Toussaint, Phó Chủ tịch nhóm Greens/ALE tại EP và là người tham gia xây dựng đạo luật này, nhấn mạnh tầm quan trọng của báo cáo Earthsight. ""Báo cáo của Earthsight đến đúng lúc: Nó tiết lộ rằng ngay cả những nhà mốt lớn của châu Âu cũng có nguy cơ liên quan đến việc phá hủy rừng Amazon"", bà Toussaint cho biết. Theo bà, ""trong bối cảnh cánh hữu và cực hữu đang tìm cách làm suy yếu quy định chống phá rừng của châu Âu, công trình này một lần nữa nhấn mạnh lý do tại sao luật này là cần thiết để bảo vệ quyền con người và các hệ sinh thái. Chúng ta phải thực hiện quy định này một cách đầy đủ và nhanh chóng, để chấm dứt sự đồng lõa thầm lặng giữa tiêu dùng châu Âu và nạn phá rừng"". Brazil đã cam kết đạt mục tiêu không phá rừng vào năm 2030. Tuy nhiên, với những gì báo cáo của Earthsight phơi bày, con đường để đạt được mục tiêu này vẫn còn nhiều chông gai, đặc biệt khi sự ""lộng lẫy"" của ngành thời trang cao cấp vẫn đang phải trả bằng cái giá quá đắt của những cánh rừng bị tàn phá.

E9883361F1CA70738CAF201B1A5DE05F,2025-07-01 11:30:29,en,PRINT,"  Bengal need not replace Gujarat or Tamil Nadu; it can elevate what they make. It can help India become a nation where one beloved brand outweighs a container ship of undifferentiated goods For Durga Puja, Samaj Sebi Sangha had transformed its lane into a flowing alpana painted by volunteers. At Lalbagan, a forest of 8,000 plants advocated environmental renewal. Another Puja organiser used abstract forms to explore inner conflict and resilience. In Bengal, even sacred rituals become acts of collective imagination. Narrative and new formats are embraced with curiosity and celebration. This cultural confidence, woven into daily life and ceremony, is not explicitly an economic resource. Yet, it may prove to be the ballast of India's growth story. We live in a world of manufacturing glut where product features are quickly replicated. Most smartphones today, for instance, offer similar capabilities. Yet Apple captures 80% of industry profits with less than 20% market share. Its design, security, and aspiration create deeper barriers to entry than its features. Foxconn, which manufactures these devices in China, earns less than $10 per unit. Apple owns the identity and, therefore, the margin. Similarly, Tesla produces a fraction of global EVs but its market capitalisation exceeds that of the entire legacy automotive industry because consumers believe they are driving the future. This shift from scale to brand explains why the export-led B2B model that once propelled China is yielding diminishing returns. Cities like Dongguan and Wenzhou became global manufacturing hubs, producing shoes, toys, and 80% of the world's eyeglass frames, often priced under $2. Yet the profits accrue to brands such as Luxottica and Warby Parker, which shape consumer desire. While China has, in recent years, developed global consumer platforms, from Alibaba to TikTok, its position in the value chain remains shaped by its manufacturing legacy. Mao's Cultural Revolution fractured artisanal continuity, severing the civilisational memory that had sustained the crafts of silk, tea, porcelain, and even the notion of a civil service. In the decades that followed, China reopened to global trade as a mass-producer of widgets that powered its rise. But to be a reliable yet fungible supplier no longer offers strategic leverage when others create the need to consume. This predicament will only deepen as Artificial Intelligence and robotics drive marginal costs lower, but imagination and connection will remain defensible moats. How can India learn from the experience of countries that have navigated the transition to consumer economies? In the United States of America, a venturesome consumer base, moulded by immigration, rewarded novelty. Sears, Roebuck and Company pioneered the mail-order catalogue, reaching rural buyers and growing into one of the world's largest firms. That model, updated by digital technology, evolved into Amazon. American consumers embraced the unfamiliar when it offered value, enabling disruption across industries. In San Francisco's transport sector, for instance, Uber displaced taxis and built a global franchise; now Waymo is replacing drivers altogether. Britain shaped consumer behaviour through Empire. Lever Brothers penetrated rural markets across the colonies. Long before Indian brands emerged, soaps such as Lifebuoy and Sunlight were household names. Even tea, now central to Indian identity, was first cultivated in Assam to break China's monopoly. It became mass-consumed only after sustained advertising campaigns. In the 1920s and the 1930s, 'tea tonga' carts offered free samples and demonstrations: early B2C efforts embedding tea into daily ritual. Decades later, Satyajit Ray designed Tea Board campaigns. His detective, Feluda, a figure of intellect and bhadralok refinement, drank Makaibari tea, aligning it with quiet discernment. Today, such associations ensure most Indian tea is domestically consumed. Italy turned objects into cultural artefacts. Ferrari cars, Barolo wines, and Gucci handbags express place, process, and symbolism. From the Roman ideal of cultivated life to Renaissance guilds, Italy built systems that transmitted skill and beauty. Cities such as Florence and Venice fused commerce with art. They developed civic institutions - legal codes, accounting systems, urban design - that supported trade through taste. This generated employment not only in factories but also in ateliers, kitchens, studios, and theatres. Their products became markers of Western civilisation; their cultural power radiated globally, shaping consumption habits across continents. For decades, India lacked the consumer base to build an aspirational economy. A poorer country naturally prioritised price, fragmenting demand and limiting scale. Tamil Nadu and Gujarat led in low-cost manufacturing; Bengaluru built the digital backbone on entry-level tech workers. But as India nears the goal of being the world's third-largest economy, that equation changes...."

For the Guerlain powder, I like the translucent all over, but more so for under the eyes, and any where I need brightening. It has a slight pink tint to it. The Medium powder I like all over, not under my eyes. It's a bit too dark under the eyes for me. I also love the medium shade if my foundation looks a bit too light, and it's gorgeous over a tinted SPF too. The powder is amazing, I agree with the container being a bit too big. I wish they would have included a smaller container to decant for travel. That would be great, especially for the price. I have to try a Guerlain blush, I'm having a hard time picking out a shade.I don't have a store nearby where I can swatch. Our Nordstrom is far, and they seem to not have much selection of Guerlain even on line. I'm not sure what's going on. My new obsession is the Prada eye shadows. I have 3 palettes, and I love them so much. Along with the Dior Cannage LE palettes. Have you tried the Dior Cannage yet? I think you would love Brown Cashmere. It's so gorgeous!! The formula is comparable to the Prada. I want to try the Guerlain shadows, but I haven't found a color story that resonates yet. Lately I've been into the smaller palettes versus large palettes. Just easier to put a look together when you're short on time. Thank you for your video, hope you're all enjoying the Summer! Xoxo PS. I love the Guerlain concealer it's lovely for the summer. I wish it came in a plastic container versus the glass, and the wand was easier to get out. I dropped mine on my tile floor, and it shattered. I order another one. What do you think about the Gucci concealer? I would like to try it, but can't figure out what shade."

This market includes formal footwear, casual footwear, and sports footwear, each catering to different lifestyle needs and The luxury footwear market is undergoing a dynamic transformation fueled by changing consumer preferences, rising disposable incomes, and the increasing influence of global fashion trends. With a sharp focus on elegance, premium quality, and brand identity, luxury shoes are no longer just about functionality — they are a lifestyle statement. According to a forthcoming report by The Insight Partners, the global luxury footwear market is projected to witness impressive growth through 2031, driven by emerging trends and the growing appetite for high-end fashion across the globe. Introduction to the Luxury Footwear Market The luxury footwear market comprises premium, high-quality shoes designed for fashion-forward consumers who value craftsmanship, exclusivity, and brand prestige. This market includes formal footwear, casual footwear, and sports footwear, each catering to different lifestyle needs and style preferences. From classic leather oxfords and sleek stilettos to designer sneakers and luxury trainers, brands are offering a diverse portfolio to attract various customer segments. These products are distributed through multiple channels, including specialty stores, supermarkets and hypermarkets, online retail, and boutique outlets. With consumers increasingly shopping online and seeking tailored, exclusive experiences, luxury shoe brands are adapting their retail strategies accordingly. The global luxury footwear market is segmented by type (formal, casual, and sports footwear), end user (men, women, and unisex), and distribution channel (offline and online platforms). The market covers major regions such as North America, Europe, Asia-Pacific, South and Central America, and the Middle East and Africa. Europe remains a dominant market due to the presence of iconic fashion houses such as Gucci, Prada, and Christian Louboutin. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific is emerging as a high-growth region driven by an expanding middle class, increasing digital penetration, and a growing youth population interested in Western fashion and luxury lifestyles. Market Growth and Demand Trends The luxury footwear market is expected to register a strong CAGR from 2025 to 2031. One of the key drivers of this growth is the increasing consumer demand for luxury products as symbols of wealth, taste, and social status. The influence of celebrity endorsements, fashion influencers, and digital platforms like Instagram and TikTok has further accelerated the desire for premium branded footwear.

mov_AE68DC4D03200A163F33590A8D76A3BC,2025-07-01 13:11:00,en,WEB,"  The global personal luxury goods market, valued at USD 410 billion in 2024, is projected to reach USD 526 billion by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 4.24%. The U.S.-China trade war poses challenges, impacting costs and availability. Key trends include circular economy initiatives, online retail strategies, and urban demand in emerging markets. Segment growth varies, with watches and jewelry leading, while beauty and fragrances witness fastest growth. APAC remains the dominant region, driven by urbanization and digital retail transformation. Major players like LVMH and Rolex leverage strategic partnerships and innovation to maintain market positioning. Personal Luxury Goods Market Dublin, July 01, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- The ""Personal Luxury Goods Market Research Report 2025-2030"" report has been added to ResearchAndMarkets.com's offering. The Personal Luxury Goods Market was valued at USD 410 billion in 2024, and is projected to reach USD 526 billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 4.24%. The global personal luxury goods market is fragmented and characterized by numerous manufacturers that hold modest market share. Key players, including LVH, Prada Group, Rolex, Kering, and Richemont, among others, have established dominance in the market by continuously innovating and expanding their product offerings. Major vendors are strategically implementing innovative technologies to maintain their market positions. For instance, in 2023, Burberry introduced its virtual store by partnering with Blankos Block Party, a gaming platform, and offering interactive product discovery. The companies in the personal luxury goods industry are also focusing on several strategic partnerships with other providers to ensure continuous supply chains and manufacturing capabilities. For instance, in 2023, Kering completed a 30% acquisition of the Italian luxury fashion house Valentino. The partnership is between Valentino's parent company, Mayhoola, and it has also provided an option for Kering to acquire the remaining 70% by 2028. The leaders in the personal luxury goods market are making significant R&D investments to enhance the availability and differentiation of their products. For instance, in 2024, Richemont acquired Vhernier, which is an Italian jewelry brand, to enhance its Jewelry Maisons division. Furthermore, companies are increasingly expanding their product range and strengthening their market positions through acquisitions and partnerships. For instance, in 2024, Lavie Luxe launched its new 18% fragrance concentration perfume line, featuring four Eau de Parfum fragrances named LUSH, LILY, LAGOON, and LOVE. Consumers are increasingly interested in luxury goods that are designed with circular economic principles, such as those that can be easily upcycled. Gucci was the first luxury brand to use ECONYL recycled nylon in ready-wear pieces, which is a 100% recycled nylon derived from fishing nets, textile waste, and a thick pile fabric used for carpets and upholstery. Luxury brands have increasingly adopted online approaches to meet evolving consumer expectations. For instance, in 2023, Dior was the most popular luxury brand online because of its strategic investments in digital marketing, e-commerce, and social media engagement. This approach helped the brand to engage a wider audience, which has boosted its online sales, especially in markets like China and the US. Brands strategically position themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops in places like Bali and Phuket. It has created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. Hence, such factors are supporting the demand for the personal luxury goods market across emerging nations. As the global economies continue to grow, disposable income levels rise, leading to increased spending on luxury items like footwear. Consumers are increasingly inclined towards luxury footwear because of changing lifestyles and fashion trends. Luxury footwear companies are focusing on the growing consumer base in developing countries such as India and other Southeast Asian countries, where wealth and demand for luxury goods are rising. In 2022, Louis Vuitton introduced its exclusive footwear collection for the Indian market, which features new colors like Rani Pink and glittering designs for celebrating India's cultural heritage. Urbanization in emerging markets such as China, India, and Southeast Asia continues to drive demand for the personal luxury goods market. In India, platforms like Luxepolis have significantly supported the development of the market by offering new and pre-owned luxury items to a growing audience in smaller cities, as the growing urban population increases the demand for high-end items. Brands are strategically positioning themselves to capture renewed demand from urban areas. For instance, Dior expanded its Dioriviera pop-up shops to places like Bali and Phuket. Additionally, collaborations between fashion houses and hospitality venues such as Fendi's beach club in Marbella have created immersive experiences that resonate with travelers seeking exclusivity. INDUSTRY RESTRAINTS The disruption in the supply chain has led to increased costs for raw materials, logistics, and transportation, which have raised operational costs and are often passed on to end consumers which leading to higher luxury goods prices. The focus on limited production to maintain exclusivity significantly raises the production costs for luxury brands. Brands often face higher unit costs for manufacturing, sourcing premium materials, and utilizing skilled labor for producing limited edition items. This limits scalability and hampers the personal luxury goods market demand. Furthermore, major brands occasionally face backlash for products or marketing campaigns, such as Louis Vuitton for selling a scarf inspired by the Palestinian keffiyeh and a jacket that seems to present Jamaican culture by using the country's flags but incorrectly represented. These factors hamper the brand value and show the need for careful consideration in global marketing efforts. PERSONAL LUXURY GOODS MARKET GEOGRAPHICAL ANALYSIS The APAC region dominated the global personal luxury goods market, accounting for a share of over 38% in 2024. APAC is experiencing a surge in urbanization and rising disposable income, particularly in countries like China, India, and Southeast Asian countries. A growing middle and upper-middle class is driving demand for luxury goods as markers of status, success, and aspiration. As consumers become more brand-conscious, luxury ownership is increasingly viewed as a symbol of achievement...."

Genau aus dem Grunde Kaufen auch viele Leute diese Luxusartikel, um sich damit besser zu Fühlen, aber es macht einen Menschen keinesfalls Glücklicher, zumindest nicht auf Dauer, da kostet es nur Verdammt viel Geld, und da wären wir wieder bei der Seele, man bleibt ja der Gleiche Mensch, ob 5 euro Shirt oder 500 euro Shirt. ☺️ Ich will hier niemandem i.welche Schlauen Ratschläge geben oder sonstwas, spreche nur aus eigener Erfahrung, und Freue mich, wenn vllt der ein oder andere sagt, er hat Recht 😉  Wünsche euch noch einen schönen Tag ihr lieben, genießt das tolle Wetter. 🌞☀️🌞 #stehezudirselbst #mutzurfarbe #selbstwert #selbstwertstärken #iam #sachsen #albrechtsburgmeissen #meißen #porzellanstadt #selfie #sunset #sunsetphotography"

The 32-year-old “Used to be Young” singer was tapped to be the face of the campaign after serving as the ambassador of the Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia fragrance since its initial release in 2021. Set against the Los Angeles skyline at sunset, the campaign imagery, shot by Tyler Mitchell, features Cyrus sprawled in a field of pink and white flowers, with a fuchsia fragrance bottle in hand. The serene scene is meant to mimic the dichotomy of the scent: a powerful blend of florals mixed with vibrant woody notes. The entire Flora collection is designed as an ode to female empowerment, femininity and freedom. This particular aroma, a reinterpretation of the original Gorgeous Gardenia, celebrates the delicate and fearless duality of womanhood, encouraging its wearer to pursue their deepest desires. “With Gucci Flora Gorgeous Gardenia Eau de Parfum Intense, I wanted to enhance the sensuality of the gardenia by capturing the flower's full depth, from its creamy richness to its woody facets,” Blanc explained. “The scent opens with a rush of citrus, unfolding into its full floral elegance, before embracing the bold warmth of its intensely enveloping depths.” Like the existing Flora fragrances, the Eau de Parfum Intense is wrapped in the brand's heritage floral print painted by Vittorio Accornero de Testa for Gucci in 1966. The “Intense” is written in a shimmery gold font. Size options include a 10-ml spray pen, as well as 30-, 50- and 100-ml bottles. Cyrus has been working as an ambassador for Gucci Flora scents for four years now. She first joined as part of the brand's 100th anniversary. Since then, she's starred in campaigns for the Gucci Flora Gorgeous Orchid Eau de Parfum and the Gorgeous Jasmine scent. The brand describes Cyrus as the perfect model for the nascent fragrance; someone who's both free-spirited and versatile. When she first joined forces with Gucci, then creative director Alessandro Michele said: “Miley Cyrus is an artist with a spirit that is both rock 'n' roll and eclectic at the same time.” Miley Cyrus and Gucci Celebrate Summer in Los Angeles View Gallery More in Style Launch Gallery: Miley Cyrus and Gucci Celebrate Summer in Los Angeles"

n0rttt5,2025-07-01 15:21:56,en,REDDIT,"  Goliath vs Goliath is a wildly inaccurate way of framing the situation. And ignores how power actually works in Hollywood. Trying to pitch the two sides as equals is like saying that an indie bookstore fighting Amazon is a fair fight. It's not about being well-off: it's about who has access to institutions that control media, money and influence. That's the real imbalance. It's about who owns the chessboard. Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively are not just celebrities but are part of a vast Hollywood eco system; and deeply entrenched in media conglomerates, tech ventures and have extremely powerful industry connections. •Disney, Marvel, WME, CAA, and their multi-billion dollar backing. •Ari Emmanuel, who heads Endeavour and WME; and is one of the most powerful players in Hollywood. •Francois Pinault: who owns Gucci, Balecniaga and CAA, another talent agency. Justin Baldoni may have grown up comfortably and well off. And his dads business may have given him some industry contacts, but it's nowhere *near* the same universe of reach and institutional power as the people opposing him in this legal case. That's not Goliath vs Goliath. It's Goliath vs *guy with a comfortable salary and some industry connections who has a slingshot* OP's point is not that 'Justin is a super poor guy with zero industry connections' - they're making a legitimate point that the legal system is tilted toward *influence and institutional power* . The PR, media, and agency leverage alone make this an unbalanced fight, as they are tilted in Lively and Reynold's favour. RE Justin saying he didn't ever have much money: I went back to double check the video for accuracy purposes and he doesn't actually use the word poor, but does say he didn't have much money. However he could easily be talking about the money he made in his acting career up until that point. Furthermore, just because his dad ran a successful marketing business does not mean extreme wealth. The company's focus was niche (product placement consulting, not mass production). Given the *extremely* high cost of living in LA, where a modest house can cost from €1-2 million, it's still possible to feel like you don't have much money. Especially if his dads company stayed small or reinvested earnings into operations. Yes, it's still privileged but that doesn't mean much in this legal fight. **Justin Baldoni is not even *close* to being in the same universe of reach and institutional power as the people opposing him in this legal case. **"

What if Gucci designed for Roman combat? This is what AI lets you explore. I'm using AI to experiment with brand morphing - taking iconic brand DNA and transplanting it into impossible worlds. Prada's clean minimalism works perfectly on sleek armor. Supreme's streetwear rebellion translates to warrior gear. Gucci's maximalist luxury creates the most extra gladiator fits ever. Before AI, this kind of conceptual work required entire design teams and massive budgets. Now? Just me, some creative prompts, and the ability to visualize “what if” scenarios instantly. This isn't about the brands themselves. It's about understanding what makes each brand *feel* like itself. Then using AI to stretch that identity into completely new contexts. Prada = refined precision Supreme = rebellious street culture Gucci = ornate luxury excess AI lets you test these brand essences in any scenario imaginable.

4c5b1f3c7c2392cdf82e77d3435cf674,2025-07-01 21:45:00,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]Il Monteverdi Festival, oltre al compositore eponimo, ha omaggiato altri grandi della musica barocca. Il 27 e il 29 giugno 2025, il Teatro Ponchielli di Cremona ha dunque proposto l' Ercole amante di Francesco Cavalli (Crema, 1602 - Venezia, 1676). Una regia moderna e acuta che ha stupito piacevolmente, come quella de Il ritorno d'Ulisse in patria . Era firmata da Andrea Bernard, assistito da Tecla Gucci Ludolf. Le scene erano di Alberto Beltrame (assistito da Giulia Turconi); i costumi di Elena Beccaro (assistita da Emilia Zagnoli), le coreografie di Giulia Tornarolli, le luci di Marco Alba. La parte musicale era affidata all' Orchestra e Coro Monteverdi Festival - Cremona Antiqua. Al clavicembalo, dirigeva Antonio Greco. Ercole amante di Cavalli: genesi e contesto Cavalli compose l' Ercole amante per le nozze di Luigi XIV di Francia con l'Infanta di Spagna Maria Teresa d'Asburgo . Il matrimonio fu festeggiatissimo, non solo perché regale, ma anche e soprattutto perché portava la pace fra due vicini burrascosi. L' Ercole amante di Cavalli (su libretto di Francesco Buti) poté però essere rappresentato solo due anni dopo, il 7 febbraio 1662, al Teatro delle Tuileries. Il soggetto mitologico permetteva di accostare lo sposo Luigi XIV a un grande eroe, destinato a nozze divine. Eppure, nonostante il motivo encomiastico dichiarato nel Prologo, il nocciolo del melodramma è costituito dalle contraddizioni e dai conflitti del matrimonio. Ercole amante: un eroe che non sa amare Chi è Ercole? È l' eroe della forza per eccellenza. Risplende finché si tratta di lottare con le belve e sopportare immani fatiche. Ma, quando si tratta di affetti, lo stesso smisurato vigore che ha ereditato dal padre Giove diviene un malus . Più che amare, Ercole desidera, pretende e conquista . Ecco, dunque, che non può sopportare il ""no"" di Iole, la giovane principessa a cui lui stesso ha ucciso il padre. Ecco perché non si cura né dei sentimenti della moglie Deianira, né di quelli del figlio Hyllo, legato a Iole. Una passione così cieca e smodata non può che avere esiti tragici, come c'insegna anche la cronaca contemporanea. La regia di Andrea Bernard al Teatro Ponchielli di Cremona Al Teatro Ponchielli di Cremona, il regista Andrea Bernard ha colto il trait d'union fra i molti personaggi del complesso dramma: il matrimonio. Ercole (Renato Dolcini, basso) è sposato con Deianira (Shaked Bar, soprano). Ma, ormai, tutti i suoi pensieri sono per Iole (Hilary Aeschliman, soprano). Aveva già chiesto la mano di quest'ultima al re suo padre. Ma lui, per rendere felice la figlia, aveva preferito fidanzarla con Hyllo (Jorge Navarro Colorado, tenore). Ercole aveva risposto uccidendo il re. Iole continua a respingere le avances del brutale eroe e ad incontrarsi segretamente con Hyllo. I loro amori fanno scoprire la forza di questo sentimento a un giovane paggio (Maximiliano Danta, controtenore). Deianira, sconsolata, si affida ai consigli del fedele domestico Licco (Danilo Pastore, controtenore). In tutto questo, intervengono anche le divinità, come in ogni mito che si rispetti. Venere (Paola Valentina Molinari, soprano) favorisce le brame amorose di Ercole; Giunone (Theodora Raftis, soprano) si schiera invece con Deianira e coi due giovani innamorati. Questa trama, che nulla ha da invidiare alle soap opera più intricate, è stata ambientata da Bernard durante un moderno ricevimento nuziale . Il Prologo ha visto i due sposi litigare e dividersi, sotto gli occhi imbarazzati degli invitati. Questi hanno risposto al disagio intonando discorsi encomiastici, con tanto di realistica goffaggine al microfono. L'aspetto caustico e tragicomico dell' Ercole amante era riassunto in questo inizio. Del resto, Ercole (col nome greco di Eracle) era già un personaggio tragicomico in un'altra opera sul matrimonio, l' Alcesti di Euripide. Ma questa è un'altra storia. Momenti di umorismo erano disseminati anche per il resto del melodramma. Si pensi al flirt fra il Paggio e Licco, nonché alla stessa interpretazione queer di quest'ultimo: elegantissimo e sbarazzino allo stesso tempo, nei suoi abiti da signora. Irresistibile Venere: come descrivere la sua grazia rococò venata di sfacciataggine? Ma più notevole ancora è stato l'espediente di un teatro nel teatro , per fare da portale fra il regno degli uomini e quello degli esseri sovrannaturali. Da qui, non uscivano solo gli dei, ma anche l'ombra di Eutyro , padre di Iole (Federico Domenico Eraldo Sacchi, basso): lasciava senza fiato con le sue movenze da zombie, tra i fumi e le fiammelle di un buio cimitero. Le divinità, invece, indossavano costumi da teatro barocco: immortali e congelate nel tempo quali erano, ma anche pronte a trasformare qualsiasi situazione in un gioco scenico, fatto di trucchi e stratagemmi. In un mare in tempesta, pronto a inghiottire il disperato Hyllo, Giunone è arrivata in vasca da bagno e Nettuno ( Federico Domenico Eraldo Sacchi, basso) si è presentato mentre le Nereidi gli radevano la barba. Per loro, in fondo, quel gioco di forze immani era mera quotidianità. Perfino i Venti dispettosi rincorrevano il Paggio navigante impugnando... pistole ad acqua. Come si è conclusa la vicenda?..."

mov_52C9BC258F8353F6F39243FC113740AE,2025-07-01 22:57:49,vi,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Hai nghi phạm, một đế chế hàng giả trị giá tỷ đô Ẩn mình giữa những dãy nhà cao tầng sầm uất của Manhattan, một mạng lưới buôn bán hàng hiệu giả tinh vi đã tồn tại và vận hành âm thầm trong nhiều năm. Dù số lượng hàng hóa khổng lồ nhưng chỉ có 2 kẻ đứng sau vận hành. Vụ bắt giữ chấn động này không bắt nguồn từ một cú điện thoại nặc danh hay một cuộc kiểm tra định kỳ mà khởi phát từ những nghi vấn nhỏ nhặt của các hãng thời trang lớn. Vào giữa năm 2023, Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel và một số tên tuổi lớn trong ngành thời trang đã đồng loạt gửi báo cáo đến Cục Điều tra An ninh Nội địa Mỹ (HSI – ICE), sau khi phát hiện các sản phẩm giả mạo được bày bán ngày càng nhiều trên các nền tảng thương mại điện tử và các cửa hàng resale ở nhiều bang. Điều khiến họ sửng sốt là độ tinh vi của hàng giả: có sản phẩm được làm giả tới mức các chuyên gia thương hiệu phải dùng thiết bị kỹ thuật cao để phân tích mã số, chất liệu và chi tiết in chìm mới có thể phân biệt được. Từ những tín hiệu mờ nhạt đó, lực lượng điều tra bắt đầu mở rộng giám sát tại khu vực Canal Street – nơi từng được biết đến là “thủ phủ hàng giả” của New York vào những năm 1990, nhưng những tưởng đã được kiểm soát chặt chẽ trong thập kỷ gần đây. Họ phát hiện một số kho hàng không có bảng hiệu, không có hoạt động bán lẻ, nhưng mỗi ngày vẫn có hàng chục chuyến giao – nhận diễn ra vào giờ thấp điểm, chủ yếu vào đêm khuya hoặc sáng sớm. Bên trong những kho hàng ấy là gì, chưa ai rõ. Nhưng điều đáng ngờ là danh tính người thuê: không đăng ký kinh doanh, không mã số thuế thương mại và dòng tiền luân chuyển qua các tài khoản cá nhân với số lượng lớn. Lần theo dữ liệu ngân hàng và tín hiệu định vị thiết bị di động, cảnh sát khoanh vùng được hai đối tượng tình nghi là Adama Sow (38 tuổi) và Mohamed Konate (48 tuổi), đều cư trú tại New York, Mỹ. Sow từng bị nghi ngờ liên quan đến các vụ nhập khẩu trái phép từ Trung Quốc nhưng chưa từng bị kết án, trong khi Konate có lịch sử vận hành các chuỗi cung ứng hàng hóa không rõ nguồn gốc từ Quảng Châu và UAE. Tất cả các manh mối đều dẫn về họ. Chiến dịch đột kích diễn ra vào rạng sáng ngày 15/11/2023, sau gần nửa năm âm thầm điều tra. Dưới sự chỉ đạo của Văn phòng Công tố Liên bang Quận Nam New York (SDNY), hơn 40 đặc vụ liên bang và cảnh sát New York đồng loạt ập vào ít nhất ba địa điểm được xác định là kho hàng chính tại Manhattan. Sow bị bắt tại chỗ khi đang kiểm tra lô hàng mới đóng gói, còn Konate bị bắt ngay tại nơi cư trú, nơi các điều tra viên phát hiện thêm hàng loạt tài liệu kế toán, danh sách đơn hàng và các thiết bị lưu trữ dữ liệu. 219.000 món hàng hiệu bị làm giả và vụ việc chưa từng có tiền lệ Tại các kho hàng, lực lượng chức năng phát hiện một kho tàng hàng giả khổng lồ: hơn 219.000 món đồ được đóng gói kỹ lưỡng với tem nhãn, hộp đựng, mã QR và thậm chí cả giấy bảo hành giả. Các thương hiệu bị làm giả trải dài từ Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Dior đến Hermès, Balenciaga, Fendi và nhiều thương hiệu xa xỉ khác. Không chỉ sản phẩm, cảnh sát còn thu giữ nhiều máy in tem nhãn, phần mềm giả lập mã hiệu, cùng dữ liệu giao dịch điện tử mô tả hàng ngàn đơn hàng đã được vận chuyển đi các bang khác trong vòng 18 tháng. Theo cáo trạng của SDNY, hai nghi phạm đã tổ chức hoạt động như một doanh nghiệp thực thụ, có chuỗi cung ứng riêng, nhân sự đóng gói, hệ thống phân phối và thậm chí là dịch vụ hậu mãi trá hình. Họ không bán hàng trực tiếp, mà vận hành thông qua nhiều tài khoản trung gian, sử dụng tên giả và sàn thương mại điện tử như Amazon, Facebook Marketplace, hoặc bán sỉ cho các đại lý resale nhỏ lẻ trên toàn nước Mỹ. Mỗi chiếc túi giả được bán ra với giá vài trăm đến hàng ngàn USD – rẻ hơn hàng thật nhưng cao hơn hàng fake thông thường – đánh đúng vào tâm lý “ngon – bổ - sang” của một lớp người tiêu dùng trẻ. Hai bị cáo bị truy tố với tội danh ""Buôn bán hàng hóa giả mạo nhãn hiệu"", theo điều 18 của Bộ luật Hình sự Hoa Kỳ, với khung hình phạt tối đa là 10 năm tù liên bang, cùng với nghĩa vụ bồi thường thiệt hại dân sự cho các thương hiệu bị ảnh hưởng. Vụ việc chưa dừng lại ở đó. Công tố viên Damian Williams cho biết cuộc điều tra vẫn đang mở rộng, với nhiều khả năng sẽ lần ra các mắt xích quốc tế từ châu Á, châu Phi và Trung Đông – những nơi bị nghi là điểm trung chuyển và sản xuất hàng giả gốc. Phát biểu sau vụ bắt giữ, ông Williams nhấn mạnh: “Đây không phải là hành vi vi phạm bản quyền đơn lẻ. Đây là một hệ thống gian lận được tổ chức tinh vi, kiếm lời hàng triệu đô la từ việc đánh lừa người tiêu dùng và phá hoại uy tín các thương hiệu hợp pháp.” Trong khi đó, đặc vụ Jason Molina thuộc ICE-HSI khẳng định thêm rằng hàng giả ngày nay không chỉ gây thiệt hại kinh tế, mà còn nuôi dưỡng các tổ chức tội phạm có tổ chức, là công cụ rửa tiền và trong nhiều trường hợp, liên quan đến tài trợ khủng bố. Báo cáo của Tổ chức Hợp tác và Phát triển Kinh tế (OECD) công bố năm 2022 cũng cho thấy quy mô đáng sợ của ngành công nghiệp hàng giả toàn cầu. Ước tính mỗi năm, hàng hóa giả mạo chiếm tới 2,5% tổng giá trị thương mại toàn thế giới, tương đương hơn 460 tỷ USD. Đáng lo hơn, thị trường hàng giả đang chuyển hướng sang các sản phẩm nhạy cảm như mỹ phẩm, dược phẩm, thực phẩm chức năng, thiết bị điện tử và linh kiện xe – những mặt hàng có thể trực tiếp ảnh hưởng tới sức khỏe và an toàn của người tiêu dùng. Vụ án Sow – Konate vì thế không chỉ là câu chuyện về hai kẻ trục lợi bất chính. Nó là biểu tượng của một thách thức toàn cầu: khi hàng giả ngày càng tinh vi, thương mại điện tử ngày càng phát triển, và niềm tin của người tiêu dùng ngày càng dễ bị lợi dụng. Mỗi cú nhấp chuột mua hàng mà không kiểm chứng nguồn gốc có thể tiếp tay cho một đường dây tội phạm khổng lồ đang hoạt động ngay giữa lòng đô thị văn minh. Và mỗi vụ án được bóc trần – như đế chế hàng hiệu giả 1 tỷ đô ở Manhattan – là lời nhắc nhở rằng: cuộc chiến chống hàng giả chưa bao giờ đơn giản. Nguồn: Tổng hợp"

218563742_129,2025-07-02 00:08:29,en,WORDPRESS,"  Co-written for Blvck Pixel: THE RISE OF WEB3 We have entered an exciting era with the rapid permeation of web3 into the worldwide tech, commerce, and media space. Web3 technologies including AR/VR tech, blockchain, NFT's, and AI have very quickly within the past few to several years transformed various industries and completely restructured the way we are looking at tech innovation and development worldwide. This is especially true in the retail industry. Innovations in AR and VR have progressed rapidly within the past several years, leading to more and more immersive experiences in everything from movies to surgery practice performed by physicians in training. More and more companies are competing in releasing VR/AR devices to transform entertainment and work, including Meta with its Oculus headsets. In 2023 Apple even announced the release and features of their wearable AR/VR headset, the Apple Vision Pro, slated for release in 2024. VR/AR has significant potential for retail. VR/AR developments are allowing consumers to try-on clothing or accessories online without having to go to a store in person. It is also permitting more interactive and sensory product displays and helping consumers get personalized products on a retailer's website. Other emerging technologies that have arisen and transformed various industries include innovations like AI and computer vision, which make browsing for products on a website and customer support experiences with AI chatbots easier and speedier for customers. AI algorithms on retail websites can also provide consumers with recommendations based on past purchases or wishlists and personalize marketing messages, emails, and other marketing content. The release of chat-GPT in late 2022 shook the world, with many tasks for workers in all industries including retail becoming doable by AI tools. Because of the development of chat GPT and other human language learning models, companies are able to better manage inventory and supply chain management, eliminate workers in simple tasks to route them to more complicated tasks, and have improved efficiency throughout the business infrastructure. The development of blockchain within the last decade has also led to new improved opportunities for industries including retail. Many companies are using blockchain as security for information or to store massive amounts of information; other companies such as Louis Vuitton and Cartier have even created their own blockchain to keep track of the history of transactions and authenticity of every luxury item through their AURA blockchain. Blockchain is also significantly improving blockchain. RFID development in conjunction with blockchain enables systems to integrate different participants in the supply chain network including suppliers, customers, stakeholders, and regulatory agencies, hence providing high degrees of accuracy. As the industry demands greater automation and accuracy of data, the industry is trending towards greater adoption with IoT and automated data collection. Finally advancements in robotics, smart shelves, and inventory management systems allows retailers to make operations more efficient and rapid, leading to better inventory tracking and more advanced supply chain management. All of these tech advancements when combined help retailers create a more seamless omnichannel shopping experience for consumers. Examples of retailers who have made changes with these technologies to their operations include Amazon, through using their autonomous mobile robot, Proteus, used to automate inventory management, and Sephora by utilizing their AR/VR try-on beauty filter for consumers to test products before purchase. DIRECT TO AVATAR: A NEW COMMERCE Because of these new tech advancements, it is important for companies to consider the significance of direct to avatar as a new form of commerce. Direct to avatar refers to a new business model where products are sold directly to consumers' digital avatars. Because it is a digital purchase for a digital avatar, the dropshipping part of the purchase is completely eliminated. This is especially true as gaming has become so popular, with billions of people playing games online monthly and spending dollars socially. Because of this retailers and other businesses need to take advantage of this change and begin selling people's avatars directly, so that people can outfit their avatars in a way they desire. An example of companies that have gone ahead and sold digital clothing directly to avatars is Gucci, with their Gucci x Tennis Clash collaboration for the Tennis Clash game website. There are expectations as well that popularity will increase because of the relative affordability that a digital avatar's outfit will have in comparison to a real-life luxury clothing item. Digital scarcity through means of limited edition digital collections by exclusive or prestige brands is also a new opportunity afforded to retailers through <a href=""https://www.forbes.com/sites/cathyhackl/2020/08/09/is-direct-to-avatar-the-next-direct-to-consumer/?sh=65a6aa57102a"">avatars. </a> AN ITERATIVE DEPLOYMENT STRATEGY What do you mean by this? Unclear DECENTRALIZING THE CRM Another aspect of retail that will be transformed by web3 is CRM. Web3 will introduce new features and functionalities that will impact CRM. A web3 CRM will help brands navigate consumer interactions but in a specifically decentralized platform. This allows increased security for consumer data and therefore improved consumer privacy. New technologies like NFT's, tokens, and immersive digital experiences will give consumers more interactive experiences that are more memorable, increasing consumer loyalty. An example of this is with Salesforce, who is assimilating blockchain wallet IDS as well as NFT transaction histories in a <a href=""https://metav.rs/web3/crm/"">data secure way</a>. Salesforce also possesses the capability to monitor Ethereum and Polygon data in real time so that businesses can get vital information on consumer behavior. This information then allows Salesforce to give customers a more personalized experience while linking older CRM databases with new web3 databases. CRM is undergoing further decentralization with the development of Wallet Relationship Management (WRM), which is where brands provide digital wallets or passports tailored to authenticate a product that is purchased with it. Brands like <a href=""https://metav.rs/web3/crm/"">Breitling</a> are already utilizing this, with Breitling issuing such passports with each watch purchased to give customers access to the watch's authentication, history, limited edition products or events relating to it, and more. This is a way that brands are able to improve their CRM capabilities and enhance the overall customer experience. OMNICHANNEL IN THE METAVERSE AGE Because of the rapid development of web3 tools, we are witnessing an increased need for omnichannel tools...."

mov_DBD7044C83C10795DF2117C99B8BFC17,2025-07-02 02:48:36,en,WEB,"  On July 1, 2025, Deborah Harry, the iconic frontwoman of Blondie, celebrated her 80th birthday, marking eight decades of a life that has profoundly shaped the landscape of rock, punk, pop, and new wave music. Born in Miami on July 1, 1945, Harry emerged as a bold and magnetic figure whose influence extends far beyond the stage, weaving through music, film, fashion, and popular culture. Debbie Harry's journey from a middle-class upbringing to becoming the heart and soul of Blondie is a testament to her fearless spirit and artistic vision. Blondie, formed in the late 1970s, was a pioneering band that blended genres in ways few dared to attempt. Their hits—""Heart of Glass,"" ""Call Me,"" ""Rapture,"" ""The Tide Is High,"" and ""One Way or Another""—became anthems for a generation that refused to be boxed in. Notably, ""Rapture"" was groundbreaking as the first number-one song in the U.S. to feature rap vocals, long before rap became mainstream. Harry's voice and style were not just about music; they were statements of identity and rebellion. She embraced disco and punk with equal passion, pioneering a sound and image that challenged norms. Her influence is evident today, with artists like Miley Cyrus covering ""Heart of Glass"" and acknowledging the debt owed to Harry's trailblazing work. Millennials and Gen Zs dissect her makeup routines on YouTube, fascinated by her iconic use of black kohl and metallic shadow, while fashion designers frequently cite her as a muse. In autumn 2024, she stunned at the Gucci show wearing eight-inch red leather platform loafers, a pencil skirt, and a matching red leather jacket—proof that her boldness and style remain as electrifying as ever. Beyond music, Harry carved out a remarkable acting career, appearing in more than 30 films and TV shows. She starred in Amos Poe's ""The Stranger,"" led in the neo-noir ""Union City"" (1980), and took memorable roles in David Cronenberg's ""Videodrome"" (1983) and John Waters' ""Hairspray"" (1988). Throughout the 1990s and 2000s, she continued to appear in independent films such as James Mangold's ""Heavy"" (1995) and ""Cop Land"" (1997), as well as ""Deuces Wild,"" ""Spun,"" and ""My Life Without Me."" Television appearances included ""Tales from the Darkside,"" ""The Adventures of Pete & Pete,"" ""Phantom 2040,"" and ""Sabrina, the Teenage Witch."" Her multifaceted career underscores her versatility and enduring appeal. Harry's life in the spotlight has not been without challenges. In a candid Vanity Fair profile published on June 30, 2025, she discussed her experiences with plastic surgery, describing it as ""a tool"" and ""necessary"" for her career in show business. She clarified that unlike some young girls today who start cosmetic procedures at a very early age, she began surgery later in life to feel more confident and to meet the demands of an industry where women's appearances are often scrutinized. Reflecting on her 1990s facelift, she compared cosmetic surgery to ""having a flu shot,"" a way of looking after oneself amidst the pressures of aging in the public eye. Harry's openness about aging also touches on the emotional toll it can take. In her memoir ""Face It"" (2019), she wrote, ""Getting older is hard on your looks. Like everybody else, I have good days and bad days and those, 'S—t, I hope nobody sees me today' days."" She has sometimes wondered if her image overshadowed her accomplishments, a poignant reflection on the complexities faced by women in entertainment. Her personal life has been equally complex and rich. Harry was adopted and has spoken about not regretting her decision not to have children, explaining that if she had wanted to, she would have adopted, given her background. Her long partnership with Blondie co-creator Chris Stein was a cornerstone of her life and career. She has described their relationship as extraordinary, akin to a marriage, and noted how their bond helped shield her from some of the darker aspects of the music industry. Though Stein is now married with children, Harry remains godmother to his kids, underscoring their enduring connection. Blondie's history includes struggles beyond the creative realm. The band faced significant financial hardship due to a business manager who embezzled funds, leading to IRS intervention and the loss of property and bank accounts. These setbacks contributed to Blondie's breakup in 1982, but after years of legal and financial straightening out, the band reunited in 1997. Their resilience is remarkable, and Harry's leadership helped keep the band's spirit alive for over five decades. Despite the losses, including the death of longtime drummer Clem Burke in April 2025, Harry remains committed to music. She performed with Blondie until 2024 and has sold over 50 million albums worldwide—11 with Blondie and five solo. A new Blondie album is set for release in fall 2025, accompanied by a documentary and biopic chronicling her and the band's extraordinary journey. Harry herself has expressed mixed feelings about summarizing a life so full and complex but remains optimistic about sparking new creativity and surprises. Throughout her career, Harry has embraced challenges and change. In a 2025 interview, she expressed a desire to look forward rather than backward, saying, ""I want challenges, I want to look ahead—to expand, or gather my physical, mental state of being and squeeze something out."" She reflected on her early days at CBGB's, the legendary New York club where Blondie first made waves, and the experimentation that defined their sound. Her candidness extends to her past drug use during the 1980s, a period marked by personal and professional struggles, including Stein's battle with the autoimmune illness pemphigus. Harry described the drug culture of the era as pervasive but not necessarily destructive in the way it is sometimes portrayed, emphasizing that she doesn't regret those experiences despite their difficulties. One of the more colorful anecdotes from her life includes an encounter with David Bowie, who famously exposed himself to her and asked, ""Can I fuck you?"" to which she replied with a sharp-witted, ""I don't know, can you?"" This story captures the punk spirit and fearless attitude that have defined her career. Looking back on her legacy, Harry acknowledges her role as a vanguard and rebel in rock and roll, a fashion icon, and a role model for generations of female artists. She remains unapologetically herself, whether in her choice of clothing—favoring ""rubber hotpants and fishnet stuff""—or her stage presence. Even at 80, she continues to inspire, challenge norms, and push boundaries. Debbie Harry's life is a vivid tapestry of music, art, resilience, and reinvention. As she celebrates her 80th birthday, her story is not just about longevity but about the power of creativity and authenticity to endure and evolve...."

 赚钱的本质还是当二道贩子，第一次创业就赚了217w 普通人没钱，没资源，没人脉，最快速的搞钱方法就是当二道贩子 做生意，不需要自己想一个产品，然后开模，然后雇员工，然后找市场，做销售。 二道贩子，你可以理解为黄牛，也可以叫中介，还有倒爷，关键是我知道的信息，你不知道， 1⃣️有人用ChatGPT批量生成短视频文案，一条卖98元，已经在卖出5000份，躺赚49万，关键是内容都是AI生成的，零cheng本。 2⃣️球鞋贩子去StockX蹲点，看哪个联名 款溢价超过300%，马. 上找莆田大哥打样，预售定金都收麻了。 3⃣️有人在卖jian霏食谱，文案从微博抄，配图直接搬运ins健身博主。 啥都不用自己弄，一个月狂卖8000份！ 一份卖9.9，纯利润都快8万了！ 有人下单就去🍑几块钱买电子版，转手就发，连打字都省了！ 4⃣️有人天天蹲日本中古网站，看到成色好的二手da排包包就下单。 花3000块淘了个Gucci老花包，国内某鱼挂8000，一周就卖出去了！ 5⃣️苹果的自动记账指令都烂大街了，依旧售价19.9月销6000➕ 有人总说AI是机会，但就不知道怎么变现，倒卖AI课你又说割韭菜。 好，我来告诉你，你用sd，mj画游戏元素，草坪，齿轮，栅栏...，做完拿去虚幻，unity卖。 别担心没市场，北美高中生用sd专门画2D游戏背景图，49一份，当天销量破百，半年卖出2万份。 我一个朋友专门给宠物设计“微缩家居”，比如狗狗的迷你沙发、猫咪的小床，每套售价500-1000元。 他甚至还推出了“宠物定制家居”，完全根据宠物主人的要求手工制作，价格翻倍。 所以说这世上从来不缺红利，缺的是发现红利的眼睛和立刻行动的狠劲。 深圳最迷人的地方，就是总有一群人在别人犹豫“这能行吗”的时候，已经默默测试、快速迭代、吃到第一块肉。 哪吒很火的时候，我蹭着《哪吒2》的热度花830块买国外三维动画教程，AI翻译加中文配音挂，标价1999照样卖断货，三个月流水过百万 想要做生意积累生产资料，其实从古到今生意的本质都是4个字：倒买倒卖，把A地方的东西搬到B地方卖，那是线下生意；把A地方的东西搬到B平台卖，那是线上生意。 信息差是最简单的赚钱魔法，你比别人多知道一点，就有可能多赚很多。 别人刷过的信息，可能就是你赚钱的机会。 #赚钱#商业思维#认知#信息差#财富思维#赚钱的本质"

   坐标深圳，96年，潮汕人，有一家20多人的团队。 昨天和男朋友聊天吃饭，他说普通人想赚钱，就去做那些不起眼的冷门生意——需求稳定、竞争小、利润高，只是大多数人根本看不上，甚至可能觉得有点土。 但是反而是大部分人看不上的路子都特挣钱 例如： 1.在卖拉布布的壁纸，用ai生成的图片卖出八千多单，我看到的时候他才刚发了一天。 这个壁纸呢卖了870多单，5.6块这个呢是卖了三百单，关键这就是纯利润啊。 2.有人在pxx花9.9买车载娃娃座椅，转手在小红薯开店卖20-30，打上给你的labubu在车上找了一个专属座位的标题，每天发笔记，四个月卖了3000单。 3.有人在卖jian霏食谱，文案从微博抄，配图直接搬运ins健身博主。 啥都不用自己弄，一个月狂卖8000份！ 一份卖9.9，纯利润都快8万了！ 有人下单就去几块钱买电子版，转手就发，连打字都省了！ 4.有人天天蹲日本中古网站，看到成色好的二手da排包包就下单。 花3000块淘了个Gucci老花包，国内某鱼挂8000，一周就卖出去了！ 买家还以为捡到漏，其实他连包都没摸过，直接让日本卖家寄给客户！ 5.ChatGPT都更新到4.0了，依然有人不会下载，依然有人把外网的下载教程搬运过来8.8一份月销售1000➕ 6.苹果的自动记账指令都烂大街了，依旧售价19.9月销6000➕ 很多人就等着天上掉馅饼，等着别人告诉他第二天就能暴富的方法。 但是，自己主动去搜索了吗，去选品了吗，去看看别人都说怎么做的了吗？ 这些连想都没想过，真的，钱这个东西基本上就绝缘了。 我其实不懂什么认知、风口，不想做什么自律打卡。 我对这种虚无缥缈的东西从不感冒，我只做离钱近的事情。 就拿我来说，前段时间《哪吒》很火的时候我花830去国外网站买别人的三维动漫的教程，然后用deepseek吧里面的内容翻译成中文，后期在自己配音上去，就变成自己的了，直接在小红薯上开店挂链接卖1999，用国外买来的素材剪辑成视频发小红薯，根本不用担心流量，饺子的哪吒2已经提前给你免费推流了，短短三个月就利润就过百w。 这个世界zui残酷的真相，95%的财富都藏在信息差里，当你还在那里和别人卷来卷去的时候，别人已经靠信息差赚的盆满钵满。 总之：当所有人都在疯狂的向前跑，你只需要掉个头，你的目光就能看到最独特的风景。 记住：一旦嗅觉到新的商机，你TM的，需要立刻像疯子一样，疯狂的扑上去，才最接近成功。 #商业思维 #赚钱 #信息差 #创业#赚钱的本质"

Một báo cáo gây sốc từ tổ chức phi chính phủ Earthsight của Anh vừa phơi bày một sự thật đau lòng: Đằng sau những chiếc túi xách hàng hiệu xa xỉ của các nhà mốt danh tiếng như Hugo Boss, Chanel hay LVMH là nạn phá rừng bất hợp pháp quy mô lớn tại Amazon - ""lá phổi xanh "" của hành tinh. Tháng 11-2025, Hội nghị lần thứ 30 các Bên tham gia Công ước Khung của Liên Hợp Quốc về Biến đổi khí hậu (COP30) sẽ được tổ chức tại Brazil - quốc gia sở hữu phần lớn rừng Amazon. Đây là lần đầu tiên sự kiện khí hậu trọng đại này chính thức đưa vấn đề rừng nhiệt đới vào chương trình nghị sự, trong bối cảnh các cánh rừng tại Amazon đang đối mặt với nguy cơ bị tàn phá nghiêm trọng bởi nhiều nguyên nhân, từ việc trồng đậu nành, các vụ cháy rừng, cho đến một nguyên nhân gián tiếp ít ai nghĩ đến: Ngành công nghiệp da. Mối liên hệ giữa da thuộc xa xỉ và nạn phá rừng Theo báo cáo của Earthsight, da được sử dụng để chế tác những chiếc túi xách sang trọng bậc nhất lại có nguồn gốc từ hoạt động chăn nuôi gia súc bất hợp pháp tại khu vực Amazon. Điều đáng báo động là chăn nuôi gia súc chính là nguyên nhân hàng đầu gây ra nạn phá rừng quy mô lớn trong những năm gần đây tại vùng đất này. Để làm rõ sự việc, Earthsight đã tiến hành một cuộc điều tra toàn diện, bao gồm phân tích tài liệu pháp lý, dữ liệu thương mại, hình ảnh vệ tinh và thậm chí là điều tra bí mật tại các nhà thuộc da ở Italy. Kết quả cho thấy sự liên đới rõ ràng của nhiều thương hiệu lớn trong chuỗi cung ứng đầy rủi ro này. Báo cáo đặc biệt nhấn mạnh hoạt động chăn nuôi gia súc bất hợp pháp tại bang Pará, phía Bắc Brazil. Tại đây, một khu vực rộng gần gấp đôi diện tích Bồ Đào Nha đã bị thiêu rụi trong vòng 20 năm qua. Sau khi được giết mổ, da của những con gia súc được chuyển đến hai nhà thuộc da của Italy là Conceria Cristina và Faeda. Đáng chú ý, hai nhà thuộc da này là đối tác thường xuyên của các thương hiệu thời trang cao cấp. Những tên tuổi lớn bị điểm mặt Coach, thương hiệu thời trang Mỹ nổi tiếng với những chiếc túi xách sang trọng ""dễ tiếp cận "", có giá bán từ 300-600 euro (350,42 - 700,84 USD) và đang hướng đến thế hệ trẻ, được xác định là một trong những khách hàng của hai nhà thuộc da trên. Không chỉ Coach, Earthsight còn điểm mặt nhiều thương hiệu danh tiếng khác cũng mua da từ Conceria Cristina và Faeda, bao gồm: Chanel, Chloé, Hugo Boss, Fendi và Louis Vuitton (thuộc tập đoàn LVMH), cùng với Balenciaga, Gucci và Saint Laurent (thuộc tập đoàn Kering). Mặc dù tất cả các thương hiệu trên đều phủ nhận việc sử dụng da từ Brazil, nhưng sau khi nhận thông báo về cuộc điều tra, một số đã nhanh chóng khởi động các cuộc điều tra nội bộ, trong khi số khác cung cấp thông tin về nguồn gốc da của họ cho Earthsight. Điều đáng nói, trong khi các cuộc điều tra đang diễn ra, ngành công nghiệp da vẫn tiếp tục vận động hành lang nhằm thoát khỏi các quy định bảo vệ rừng mới của châu Âu, dự kiến có hiệu lực vào cuối năm nay. Thậm chí, một sự kiện đã được tổ chức tại Nghị viện châu Âu (EP) để thúc đẩy lợi ích của họ. Lời kêu gọi hành động Ông Rafael Pieroni, Trưởng nhóm Mỹ Latinh của Earthsight, thẳng thắn bày tỏ sự thất vọng: ""Người tiêu dùng các sản phẩm xa xỉ thường kỳ vọng rằng mức giá cao sẽ đảm bảo họ không góp phần vào nạn phá rừng hay việc chiếm đoạt đất của người bản địa. Cuộc điều tra này cho thấy niềm tin đó đang bị đặt sai chỗ. Chừng nào các thương hiệu thời trang chưa thực hiện đầy đủ trách nhiệm rà soát chuỗi cung ứng của mình, họ sẽ không thể đảm bảo rằng sản phẩm của mình không liên quan đến những hành vi lạm dụng này Vào tháng 1-2026, Quy định Chống Phá rừng của Liên minh châu Âu (EUDR) sẽ chính thức có hiệu lực, buộc các doanh nghiệp phải chứng minh rằng da và các nguyên liệu thô khác mà họ sử dụng ""không liên quan đến nạn phá rừng "". Bà Marie Toussaint, Phó Chủ tịch nhóm Greens/ALE tại EP và là người tham gia xây dựng đạo luật này, nhấn mạnh tầm quan trọng của báo cáo Earthsight. ""Báo cáo của Earthsight đến đúng lúc: Nó tiết lộ rằng ngay cả những nhà mốt lớn của châu Âu cũng có nguy cơ liên quan đến việc phá hủy rừng Amazon "", bà Toussaint cho biết. Theo bà, ""trong bối cảnh cánh hữu và cực hữu đang tìm cách làm suy yếu quy định chống phá rừng của châu Âu, công trình này một lần nữa nhấn mạnh lý do tại sao luật này là cần thiết để bảo vệ quyền con người và các hệ sinh thái. Chúng ta phải thực hiện quy định này một cách đầy đủ và nhanh chóng, để chấm dứt sự đồng lõa thầm lặng giữa tiêu dùng châu Âu và nạn phá rừng Brazil đã cam kết đạt mục tiêu không phá rừng vào năm 2030. Tuy nhiên, với những gì báo cáo của Earthsight phơi bày, con đường để đạt được mục tiêu này vẫn còn nhiều chông gai, đặc biệt khi sự ""lộng lẫy "" của ngành thời trang cao cấp vẫn đang phải trả bằng cái giá quá đắt của những cánh rừng bị tàn phá.

A pair of ""Dreamlux"" leggings reviewers can't help but compare to Lululemon's Align joggers thanks to that buttery soft material — but, like, a lotttt cheaper. They're legit perfect for running errands, lounging around, or even hitting that squat goal at the gym — because yeah, they're just that comfy. I bought these on Prime Day, which is the only day I will buy leggings because I hate wearing leggings with a burning passion. My ""I'm not like other girls"" bit is that for some reason I am always comfier in jeans than leggings. BUT NOT THESE!!! They slide on. The fabric is so lightweight and breathable that it feels like a whisper. The band is so deceptively comfortable that sometimes I'm like, ""Am I still wearing them??"" I use them to run outdoors because that is the only circumstance I'll wear a legging, and I'm happy to report after several washes, they are durable and compressive enough to withstand workouts. They would be excellent for lounging if I weren't wired in this odd anti-legging way. I have already bought two more pairs and made my friends buy them, too. Promising review: ""Super comfy. I usually don't write reviews, I tried this first before buying Lulu, and these are the most comfortable leggings for every day and even for workouts. Highly recommended!"" —Criselle Johnson Get them from Amazon for $29+ (available in women's sizes XXS–XXL, two inseams, and 22 styles). 2. A Baccarat Rouge 540-inspired moisturizing body wash with white jasmine, red currant, and sweet amber so you can smell as ✨expensive✨ as you feel. See what BuzzFeed Writer Emma Lord has to say about this: ""I bought this after being peer-pressured by all the lovely reviews and I'm happy to report it lives up to the hype. The scent is lovely — it has depth with a hint of floral, but it's light and not at all overpowering. My favorite thing about it is how easily it pairs other scents, because I am a body mist gremlin who swaps out her scents every day. The lather is also deeply satisfying and I feel quite refreshed and squeaky clean without ever feeling dry."" Promising review: ""Cremo's body wash is nothing short of exceptional. If you're a fan of luxurious fragrances, this product will quickly become your new favorite. It boasts an incredible scent that perfectly mimics Baccarat Rouge 540 — a fragrance renowned for its sophisticated and captivating aroma. What sets this body wash apart is not just its stunning scent but also its longevity. The fragrance lingers beautifully throughout the day, ensuring you stay enveloped in that luxurious aroma long after your shower."" —Ralph D. Thompson II Get it from Amazon for $9.99 (available in three other scents). 3. A Catrice ""Instant Awake"" Under Eye Brightener so you can trick everyone around you into thinking you got the full recommended nine hours of sleep when you were actually too busy marathoning the latest season of Love Island. This baddie gives you instant coverage but is incredibly lightweight, and it's made with hyaluronic acid and shea butter to moisturize your skin. The color-adaptive formula is designed so one of two shades will work on any skin tone. Promising review: ""Took years off my eyes! This product is so reasonably priced. I came across a TikTok promoting this and decided to take a chance since the price was super reasonable. My eyes looked brighter in a good way, and the concealer worked so well that I felt I looked younger. I got compliments from friends asking what I did differently with my makeup. I recommend it."" —Placeholder Get it from Amazon for $6 (available in four shades). 4. A fabric defuzzer you can simply glide over areas with pilling, aka those unwanted fuzzies that pile up on your furniture and clothes. Now, you can smooth out your couch without manually pulling each and every piece of fuzz. Promising review: ""I have watched TikTok after TikTok before buying this, and it has saved many of my clothes that I considered not wearing anymore. For example, sweatpants after a few months of wear and washing get extremely linty. This has saved them, and they look almost new."" —Sasha..."

mov_1F728A23A32528612C5663D07BBE2396,2025-07-02 12:00:00,en,WEB,"  Fashion world has its own rules. Mispronouncing brand names is a big no-no. This guide helps you pronounce popular fashion brand names correctly. It covers French, Italian, and Spanish brands. Learn to say names like Hermes, Gucci, and Balenciaga right. Adidas and Nike are also included. Now you can talk fashion with confidence. They say, fashion comes its fair share of faux pas and flair!While luxurious wardrobes and style statements speak for the 'flair' part, the faux pas part most certainly includes the mispronunciations of the well-known fashion brands (despite those being extremely famous). And while these mishaps are quite cliché, they're not chic at all.Because let's be honest – in the world of fashion, half the battle is looking the part, and the rest of it is acing the etiquette (which includes the correct pronunciation of popular fashion brands). Mispronouncing a luxury label can cost you credibility faster than you can say “Céline.” Lucky for you, we've done the hard work. From Parisian labels to Italian icons and streetwear staples, this guide is sprinkled with phonetic line-drawing, brand backstories, and quirky insider tips to help you glide through any style conversation with ease.So, say goodbye to awkward pauses and hello to stylish confidence – let's break it down, brand by brand. French elegance: Subtle, chic, and tricky – Not “Her-meez,” but gentle vowel start, silent 'H' and 's': “air‑MEZ” or “er‑MEZ”, not “her‑meez.” – Often butchered as “Gah‑vin‑chee.” The correct French flourish? “zhee‑VOHN‑shee”, with soft 'G', nasal 'on', and a gentle final “‑shee.” – Forget “Shan‑elle.” The proper style? “SHUH‑nel.” Chic, crisp, simple, and oh-so‑Parisian. – Yes, it's not “BAL‑mayn.” Roll it out like “bal‑MAH”, trailing off the 'n' softly for that French flair. – Drop those hard Ts! The smooth version: “EEV san‑loh‑rah(n)”, a lovers' lane nasal finish. – Strut smoothly: “kris‑tee‑ahn loo‑boo‑TAHN”, not “tin.” – “LA-kwa.” So “kris‑tee‑ahn luh‑kwa”, rolling that l–r combo beautifully. – Play it subtly: “comb‑DAY gar‑SON”, letting the 's' fade, nasal 'on' intact. Italian icons: Bold, bright, and vowely – It's “GOO‑chee”, emphasis on the first syllable, never “Goo‑kee.” – Despite the trendy slip, it's properly “ver‑SAH‑cheh.” Donatella herself has piped up to confirm it. – Simple and sweet: “PRAH‑dah”, sturdy first syllable, light second. – The fun-filled style comes through in “mos‑KEY‑no”, not “mos‑chee‑no.” – Soft and elegant: “boh‑TEH‑gah veh‑NEH‑ta”, a solid roll in every segment. – Smooth Italian gloss: “DOL‑chay eh ga‑BAN‑eh”, not “Gab‑anna.” Spanish flair and subtle sound – Spanish royalty. Break it into “bah‑LEN‑see‑AH‑gah,” emphasizing the “AH” and smoothing past the “cia.” – Spanish elegance meets German twist: say “lo‑WEH‑vay”, not “low‑eeve.” Athleisure staples – A German classic: “AH‑dee‑dahs”, emphasis on the first syllable, founder Adi Dassler's namesake. – Named after the Greek goddess, it's “NY‑kee”, not “Nighk.” – Elegant German soap-opera: “POR‑shuh”, with a soft “‑uh” ending. Cross-cultural gems – Pronounce “BOOL‑gah‑ree,” highlighting the “u” after “B.” – Soft, refined: “kar‑tee‑AY”, not “Car‑tee‑er.” – From French fashion forward: “ZHAK‑moose.” – A blend of syllables: “seh‑LEEN,” soft start, piercing end.Nailing the correct pronunciation of a fashion might seem like a superficial conquest – but it isn't just about speaking the name; it's about stepping into the essence of each brand. Elevating your fashion conversations goes beyond clothes – it's about knowing the names and pronouncing them with confidence, creativity, and cultural awareness.From the sonorous softness of French designers to the vibrant clarity of Italian labels, each namescape tells a story – learn the sound, share the style.With this guide, you're not just knocking it out of the vocabulary park; you're stepping onto the stylistic stage with poise and pizzazz...."

Gần đây, việc sử dụng công cụ quảng cáo AI đang tăng mạnh khi nhà nhà, người người đều có thể tự tạo ""cây nhà lá vườn"". Các nền tảng lớn đều có công cụ AI riêng Các nền tảng quốc tế như Google, Meta, TikTok, Reddit và Pinterest đều đã lần lượt tung ra công cụ quảng cáo AI của riêng mình. Điều này đang làm thay đổi cục diện ngành quảng cáo vốn xoay quanh mối quan hệ giữa nhà quảng cáo và các công ty quảng cáo trung gian. Trước đây, các agency đảm nhiệm vai trò lập kế hoạch, sản xuất nội dung quảng cáo, phân phối và phân tích hiệu quả. Nhưng hiện nay, những chức năng này đang dần bị thay thế bởi các công cụ AI. Không chỉ các doanh nghiệp nhỏ – vốn không có ngân sách thuê agency – mà cả các tập đoàn lớn cũng đang tích cực áp dụng giải pháp AI để tối ưu chi phí và hiệu quả quảng cáo. Tờ Wall Street Journal gần đây nhận định: “Khi các nền tảng trực tuyến tung ra công nghệ tự động hóa quảng cáo, các agency lớn từng thống trị ngành suốt nhiều thập niên đang đứng trước nguy cơ bị đe dọa”. Đáng chú ý, khi Meta công bố mục tiêu tự động hóa toàn bộ quy trình quảng cáo bằng AI vào năm 2026, cổ phiếu của những agency lớn như Publicis Groupe và Omnicom đã giảm 3-4%. Meta kỳ vọng AI có thể đảm nhiệm từ việc xây dựng kế hoạch thương hiệu, thiết lập ngân sách, xác định mục tiêu người dùng, cho đến sản xuất hình ảnh và video quảng cáo. Họ cũng lên kế hoạch cung cấp quảng cáo cá nhân hóa – ví dụ: người ở vùng núi sẽ thấy quảng cáo xe leo núi, còn người ở thành phố sẽ thấy xe chạy trong đô thị. TikTok mới đây đã ra mắt công cụ AI có thể tạo ra video quảng cáo dài 5 giây từ ảnh hoặc văn bản do nhà quảng cáo nhập vào. Ngoài ra, công cụ này còn có thể hỗ trợ tạo video dài hơn. Reddit thì giới thiệu dịch vụ phân tích hiệu quả quảng cáo bằng cách cung cấp phản hồi từ người dùng về quảng cáo đã chạy. Trong khi đó, công cụ Performance Max của Google sẽ tự động lựa chọn nền tảng quảng cáo và đối tượng mục tiêu dựa trên yêu cầu của nhà quảng cáo. Mọi công ty đều có thể sử dụng AI để giảm chi phí quảng cáo Tờ Wall Street Journal cũng đưa tin rằng số lượng các công ty thời trang sử dụng công cụ quảng cáo AI đang gia tăng. Các tập đoàn lớn như LVMH và Armani đã bắt đầu thử nghiệm AI tạo nội dung để giảm chi phí quảng cáo, trong bối cảnh doanh số tại thị trường Trung Quốc sụt giảm. Hồi tháng 2, Gucci cũng đã giới thiệu một quảng cáo do AI tạo ra. LVMH tin rằng AI sẽ đóng vai trò chủ chốt trong việc đối phó với khủng hoảng kinh tế và nhu cầu suy giảm. Còn L'Oréal thì cho biết họ đang hợp tác với Nvidia để đẩy mạnh việc ứng dụng AI trong hoạt động quảng cáo. Tờ New York Times gần đây nhận định: “Quyền lực đang dịch chuyển từ các công ty quảng cáo sang các nền tảng công nghệ và thời điểm đó đang đến gần khi những cái tên như Google và Amazon tung ra công cụ AI”, đồng thời nhấn mạnh: “Các nền tảng có thể tích hợp AI vào quy trình mua quảng cáo của nhà quảng cáo. Nếu công cụ AI của Google và Meta cho thấy hiệu quả thực tế, một số nhà quảng cáo có thể bắt đầu đặt câu hỏi về sự cần thiết của các agency”. Một số chuyên gia dự đoán rằng các agency lớn sẽ buộc phải tái cấu trúc và cắt giảm nhân sự. Nhà phân tích Michael Nathanson thuộc hãng nghiên cứu MoffettNathanson chia sẻ với Wall Street Journal: “Không còn cần một đội ngũ 1.000 người nữa. Các agency lớn sẽ phải thu hẹp quy mô để thích nghi với công nghệ”. Đây là một cảnh báo nghiêm túc đối với những công ty quảng cáo không sớm chuyển đổi số."

Robert Rizzolo has landed at Alexander Wang, where he has been named global president. Most recently Rizzolo was with Marc Jacobs as chief merchandising officer. He had been with Jacobs for four years. When he departed Jacobs last month, he wrote on LinkedIn, “These years have marked some of the company's most profitable and transformative eras, and I'm incredibly proud to have been part of it.” Rizzolo claimed in the post that he had helped shape some of Jacobs' major milestones, including “the meteoric rise of The Tote Bag, the revival of Stam (a popular bag) and Beauty, the re-launch of Ready-to-Wear, Footwear and Jewelry, the cultural impact of Heaven.” Earlier, Rizzolo was divisional vice president of global merchandising at Michael Kors and before that he was with Gucci as divisional merchandise manager. Other roles included buyer for Burberry, associate merchandiser at Calvin Klein, and assistant merchandiser at Gap, where he spent nearly eight years. Neither Rizzolo nor Alexander Wang could be reached for comment Wednesday morning. In a LinkedIn post, Rizzolo said he joined Wang on Tuesday. “This brand has held a place in my heart for two decades — genre-defying, culturally sharp, relentlessly creative. To take on this role alongside Alex and lead this exceptionally talented team into a new chapter is an honor I welcome with gratitude and energy. “I have always been inspired by the passion that fuels founder-led brands, and I'm thrilled to match Alex's drive and dedication to the brand and the business. The next chapter starts now,” he wrote. In a WWD story in December 2023, Wang said it was searching for a new chief executive officer. The company's adviser has been Paula Sutter (former president of Diane von Furstenberg), who's been advising the brand for over 15 years. Sutter couldn't be reached for comment Wednesday. In the 2023 WWD story, Wang said he had gone through “a complete transformation both personally, and through work,” after being accused of sexual misconduct and sexual assault in 2000. The company, which had moved into sprawling offices at 139 Beekman Street in 2023, was recommitting to its North American business. It had committed to building the bodywear category, opening freestanding stores in North America and strengthening its online business. It had also planned growth in Europe in 2024. It was reported that the company was tracking to close out 2023 with more than $200 million in global revenues. China had become its number-one market, followed by North America. 03"

WIGZ has created bold campaigns for Jordan, Nike, Puma, the Premier League, and Fanatics, working with iconic talent and shaping how brands become the conversation. LBB> The ad/music video from my childhood that stays with me… Nathan> The 'No Church in the Wild' music video has never left me. Romain Gavras turned a police riot into something strangely beautiful. The techno riot at the end with lasers is insane. It's a reference point I've returned to countless times. LBB> The ad/music video/game/web platform that made me want to get into the industry… Nathan> This goes way back, but I vividly remember the Nike World Cup commercial set in the Colosseum – when Eric Cantona pops his collar and defeats the devil. I knew in that moment this was my world. I had to find a way into it. LBB> The creative work I keep revisiting… Nathan> Alexander McQueen is my idol. A true creative renegade who told stories through fashion like no one else. I keep his book next to my desk and revisit it often. Seeing his exhibition at the Met was like seeing something from another world. The fashion show, where a robot painted a dress live on the runway, was spectacular. Virgil and Pharrell are also constant sources of inspiration for me. LBB> My first professional project… Nathan> I've honestly blocked out most of my first projects. I didn't have a glamorous start – I graduated during the 2010 financial meltdown and had to hustle hard, creating independent projects late at night just to stand out. A couple of years later, I finally got my break and started making work I was proud of. LBB> The piece of work that made me vow to never make anything like that… Nathan> Bad work doesn't make me as angry as seeing creative agencies publishing the hell out of bang-average creative. That makes me angry. It's one thing to recognise something isn't great, but attempting to convince me to celebrate something that is poor annoys me greatly. That said, seeing bad work brings me peace, too. It's a reminder that even if your next piece doesn't land perfectly, it's probably still miles better than a lot of what's out there. LBB> The piece of work that still makes me jealous… Nathan> I loved the Gucci catwalk when Alessandro Michele sent models down the runway carrying replicas of their own severed heads. It was absolutely insane, and I loved it. My good friend Caleb Jensen made a Nike commercial with an overweight kid running toward the camera. The tagline was, 'Find Your Greatness'. It was perfect. I also loved the old Stella Artois French films and Diesel's 'Be Stupid' campaign. I'm a fan of fashion when it brings humour and storytelling into the mix. LBB> The creative project that changed my career… Nathan> What started as a battery commercial for Duracell turned into something much bigger. We told the story of the first deaf player in the NFL who used batteries to power his hearing aids. The film ended up airing during the Super Bowl, went viral on Reddit, and resonated with many people. That spot opened doors, especially into the sports world, which is where I thrive. Soon after, I helped rebrand the 76ers, launched Lady Gaga's album, and it all started rolling from there. LBB> The work I'm proudest of… Nathan> Since launching WIGZ, I've been incredibly proud of the wide range of projects we've tackled. We're no longer just making ads – we're crafting cultural moments and immersive brand experiences that people actually want to engage with. We've been fortunate to collaborate with Jimmy Butler on Bigface Coffee, launched shoes for Luka Dončić and Jayson Tatum with Jordan Brand, and helped shape Bigface's identity. I truly love the brands we've been able to engage with: Nike, Jordan, Fanatics, Puma, Premier League – the list goes on. But what I'm most proud of is the range – from films and fashion to books, retail environments, and live events. LBB> The project that makes me cringe… Nathan> Still top secret...."

A devastating judgment in a sprawling civil fraud case pierced the heart of a decades-old narrative Trump has used to both boost his national profile and attract investments into his up-and-down real estate and branding enterprise. Trump still owes more than half a billion dollars, with growing interest, in the wake of that ruling. Dual verdicts from defamation lawsuits brought by E Jean Carroll had put the president on the hook for another $91 million. Meanwhile, his reality television and licensing profits were declining as the Trump Organization had largely turned off a spigot of foreign branding deals during his first administration. But the president and his two eldest sons refocused the family business to attract lucrative partnerships once again — this time by betting big on cryptocurrency and the Trump branding itself while hoovering up investors who saw in his election their own financial victory, all the while personally enriching Trump himself. more than 2,000 documents revealing the state of the president's finances throughout his fraud case and into the 2024 election. After his victory, the new family business — no longer a real-estate titan — “kicked into overdrive,” according to the outlet, with international deals opening up multiple channels to funnel cash to the president, largely invisible from current financial disclosure requirements, the Times reported. Trump was able to put up enough cash — to the tune of nearly $300 million — to appeal those cases. He has not paid down any of the judgments against him. Rather than sell off properties to pay off his judgments, the family business doubled down into new ventures to generate millions. Internal documents suggest the moves were necessary to keep his business empire intact, according to The Times. A flurry of money-making ventures — from Trump Sneakers, Trump Mobile and Trump Fragrances to guitars and a $59.99 — have joined Trump's expansive licensing footprint, all capitalizing on the family brand and his presidency. The family's embrace of crypto similarly requires little or no investment, risk or operational responsibility, The Times notes. Moves into cryptocurrency and media properties — under the umbrella of the publicly traded company behind Trump's social media platform Truth Social — instead largely rely on the family brand to turn the president's supporters into customers. Trump owns more than half of Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. stock, which is worth roughly $2 billion. The family's crypto partners also raised all or more of the capital and run the day-to-day business behind their memecoins, otherwise worthless assets that have collected tens of millions of dollars in fees. Those business interests are now enmeshed in an administration awash in conflicts of interest. Trump, with partnerships in several crypto ventures, is effectively the industry's chief regulator. And real estate and licensing deals allow Trump to sell access to investors buying into one of the world's most famous names who also happens to be president. It remains unclear how viable the family's new businesses are, and whether the president can cash out. He cannot yet sell off his crypto, and his Truth Social would likely collapse if he unloaded his shares. But the new influx of cash on tenuous investments appears to be enough to cover legal costs and mortgages and other financial obligations. The president's business assets are held by The Donald J. Trump Revocable Trust, which is controlled by his oldest son, Donald Trump Jr. Eric Trump effectively runs the day-to-day operations, and both serve as executive vice presidents of their father's company. In 2023, Trump had testified that he had between $300 million and $400 million in cash — but those balances fluctuated wildly over the years, including hitting a low of $52 million in 2018, according to documents reviewed by The Times. Reliable long-term deals were drying up. Big brands at his Trump Tower in Manhattan, where he launched his political career in 2015, have shrunk to just one major retailer, Gucci, and a gift shop hawking Trump-branded trinkets. Vacancies at his 40 Wall Street and Trump Tower in Chicago aren't pulling in sufficient cash to cover their costs, The Times found. After the sale of the Old Post Office in Washington, D.C., which Trump renovated and opened as a hotel in 2016, Trump sold off his interests to a private equity firm in 2022 for $375 million. But the buyer couldn't cover closing costs and borrowed $28 million from the Trumps before defaulting on the loan, The Times found. Without that repayment, Trump was left with $79 million from the sale, after taxes, after having invested roughly $100 million in the project. Meanwhile, the Trump Organization has inked deals for developments in India, Dubai, Qatar, Vietnam and Serbia, while financial support from Saudi Arabia has helped his Trump-branded golf courses. Last year, Trump lost a years-long blockbuster civil trial in a case in which a Manhattan judge found that the president and his associates defrauded banks and investors by inflating the values of his assets in return for more favorable loans to benefit his real-estate empire. Trump's mogul-like persona was a “fantasy” made up of cheating, lying and outright fraud, presiding over the lawsuit from New York Attorney General Letitia James, whose investigation reported that the Trump and his chief associates “grossly and materially inflated” assets over a decade. Justice Arthur Engoron wrote that Trump and his co-defendants were “likely to continue their fraudulent ways unless the Court grants significant injunctive relief. “Their complete lack of contrition and remorse borders on pathological,” he wrote."

mov_AB28BCB31E9E0514AAFCF92C6D454F1F,2025-07-02 17:12:53,en,WEB,"  They say, fashion comes its fair share of faux pas and flair! While luxurious wardrobes and style statements speak for the 'flair' part, the faux pas part most certainly includes the mispronunciations of the well-known fashion brands (despite those being extremely famous). And while these mishaps are quite cliché, they're not chic at all. Because let's be honest – in the world of fashion, half the battle is looking the part, and the rest of it is acing the etiquette (which includes the correct pronunciation of popular fashion brands). Mispronouncing a luxury label can cost you credibility faster than you can say “Céline.” Lucky for you, we've done the hard work. From Parisian labels to Italian icons and streetwear staples, this guide is sprinkled with phonetic line-drawing, brand backstories, and quirky insider tips to help you glide through any style conversation with ease. So, say goodbye to awkward pauses and hello to stylish confidence – let's break it down, brand by brand. French elegance: Subtle, chic, and tricky Hermès – Not “Her-meez,” but gentle vowel start, silent 'H' and 's': “air‑MEZ” or “er‑MEZ”, not “her‑meez.” Givenchy – Often butchered as “Gah‑vin‑chee.” The correct French flourish? “zhee‑VOHN‑shee”, with soft 'G', nasal 'on', and a gentle final “‑shee.” Chanel – Forget “Shan‑elle.” The proper style? “SHUH‑nel.” Chic, crisp, simple, and oh-so‑Parisian. Balmain – Yes, it's not “BAL‑mayn.” Roll it out like “bal‑MAH”, trailing off the 'n' softly for that French flair. Yves Saint Laurent – Drop those hard Ts! The smooth version: “EEV san‑loh‑rah(n)”, a lovers' lane nasal finish. Christian Louboutin – Strut smoothly: “kris‑tee‑ahn loo‑boo‑TAHN”, not “tin.” Christian Lacroix – “LA-kwa.” So “kris‑tee‑ahn luh‑kwa”, rolling that l–r combo beautifully. Comme des Garçons – Play it subtly: “comb‑DAY gar‑SON”, letting the 's' fade, nasal 'on' intact. Italian icons: Bold, bright, and vowely Gucci – It's “GOO‑chee”, emphasis on the first syllable, never “Goo‑kee.” Versace – Despite the trendy slip, it's properly “ver‑SAH‑cheh.” Donatella herself has piped up to confirm it. Prada – Simple and sweet: “PRAH‑dah”, sturdy first syllable, light second. Moschino – The fun-filled style comes through in “mos‑KEY‑no”, not “mos‑chee‑no.” Bottega Veneta – Soft and elegant: “boh‑TEH‑gah veh‑NEH‑ta”, a solid roll in every segment. Dolce & Gabbana – Smooth Italian gloss: “DOL‑chay eh ga‑BAN‑eh”, not “Gab‑anna.” Spanish flair and subtle sound Balenciaga – Spanish royalty. Break it into “bah‑LEN‑see‑AH‑gah,” emphasizing the “AH” and smoothing past the “cia.” Loewe – Spanish elegance meets German twist: say “lo‑WEH‑vay”, not “low‑eeve.” Athleisure staples Adidas – A German classic: “AH‑dee‑dahs”, emphasis on the first syllable, founder Adi Dassler's namesake. Nike – Named after the Greek goddess, it's “NY‑kee”, not “Nighk.” Porsche – Elegant German soap-opera: “POR‑shuh”, with a soft “‑uh” ending. Cross-cultural gems Bvlgari (Latin-script brand) – Pronounce “BOOL‑gah‑ree,” highlighting the “u” after “B.” Cartier – Soft, refined: “kar‑tee‑AY”, not “Car‑tee‑er.” Jacquemus – From French fashion forward: “ZHAK‑moose.” Celine – A blend of syllables: “seh‑LEEN,” soft start, piercing end. Nailing the correct pronunciation of a fashion might seem like a superficial conquest – but it isn't just about speaking the name; it's about stepping into the essence of each brand. Elevating your fashion conversations goes beyond clothes – it's about knowing the names and pronouncing them with confidence, creativity, and cultural awareness. From the sonorous softness of French designers to the vibrant clarity of Italian labels, each namescape tells a story – learn the sound, share the style. With this guide, you're not just knocking it out of the vocabulary park; you're stepping onto the stylistic stage with poise and pizzazz...."

Co-founder Gilberto Loureiro began working in textile factories as a teenager and quickly noticed how slow, manual inspection processes allowed production flaws to continue for hours, leading to massive amounts of discarded material, according to CNBC. After earning a master's degree in physics, Loureiro launched Smartex with the goal of digitizing defect detection using real-time vision systems and AI. Don't Miss: Massive Demand & Disruptive Potential – Boxabl has received interest for over 190,000 homes, positioning itself as a major disruptor in the housing market. Revolutionary Manufacturing Approach – Inspired by Henry Ford's assembly line, Boxabl's foldable tiny homes are designed for high-efficiency production, making homeownership more accessible. Affordable Investment Opportunity – With homes priced at $60,000, Boxabl is raising $1 billion to scale production, offering investors a chance to own a stake in its growth. Real-Time ""Golden Stops"" that Rescue Millions of Garments According to Smartex, it integrates cameras and computer vision software into textile machines to detect flaws the instant they appear. When an error is found, the system pauses production immediately, triggering what Smartex calls a ""Golden Stop."" According to the company, over 110,000 Golden Stops have saved more than 1 million kilograms of fabric since the system launched. That number translates to roughly 5.8 million garments saved from the landfill. Beyond sustainability, Smartex says that the system improves factory yields by 0.37% per kilogram of fabric, a meaningful margin boost in an industry that operates on thin profitability, CNBC reports. ""If this is the largest industry that is still untouched by the internet and is one of the largest pollutants in the world, and nobody is working on this in terms of technology, then there is a massive gap here,"" Loureiro told CNBC.

That same round, H&M Group made a strategic investment, becoming one of the first global retailers to endorse the startup. Amazon also joined through its AWS Compute for Climate Fellowship, which CNBC says provides advanced cloud resources to early-stage climate startups. Smartex uses Amazon Web Services tools to train its AI models, which must adapt to a wide range of fabric textures and colors. ""Climate tech startups, they have so much [research and development] that they need to do … maybe even more than … standard tech companies, they have to invent new science or new technology, as well as new business models,"" Lisbeth Kaufman, head of climate tech business development, startups and venture capital at AWS, told CNBC.

Proximity to contraband(guns and drug residue in master bedroom closet), contraband proximity to owner's property(like clothes or drug residue found in a Gucci bag within the same closet), paraphernalia related to contraband in proximity(firearm sights, Kevlar, bullets, magazines, drugs of the same kind that matched the residue within the house). Whether a jury thinks that's enough is a different story, but that's enough to get charges. It's not like they were looking for something else. They believed he had illegal firearms and drugs, enough for a judge to grant a warrant and found them in the suspects bedroom closet and throughout the house. The idea that's not enough to bring charges is ridiculous. Whether a jury finds that as sufficient evidence is a different story. But people have absolutely been convicted with much less evidence. I'm reading more and the defense even used the fact that they didn't charge him with the guns as a defense. Arguing if they didn't charge him gun possession then why are they claiming he used guns for the racketeering charge. The defense literally used the lack of  gun charges against the prosecution. The prosecution fucked up big time. ""While the prosecution argued that Combs used guns to intimidate and control others, specifically his ex-girlfriends, the defense countered by highlighting the lack of direct gun charges and suggesting that the evidence was exaggerated. The defense further argued that the prosecution's case was focused on racketeering and that the gun evidence was not central to those charges, suggesting that if the government believed he used weapons, they would have included those charges."""

ed1099daebaa0236a270cb5ee458d419,2025-07-02 22:21:00,en,WEB,"  The Creative Arts Hall of the University of Lagos hosted the stage performance of Ooni Luwo, a historical drama written by Dimeji Sodeke. The play, which tells the story of the only female Ooni of Ife, Luwo Gbagida, provided a gripping and thoughtful portrayal of power, gender, and cultural memory. The play captured Luwo's reign and contributions to the ancient kingdom of Ile-Ife. It served as an artistic excavation of a neglected chapter of Yoruba history, drawing attention to the reign of a woman who once ruled one of the greatest Yoruba empires. With its thoughtful direction and strong performances, the production opened a window into an important historical narrative that is rarely highlighted in mainstream discourse. Oluwasegun Abiodun Jimoh, also known as Cee-m, directed the production and shared his thoughts on the process. He noted that it was his first time learning that a woman had ever ruled in Ile-Ife, and directing the stage adaptation gave him a deeper understanding of this historical reality. He explained that the experience ignited a sense of historical consciousness within him, which he believes would be similarly awakened in others who watch the performance. Victoria Uzoechi-Adeniran, the supervising producer, described the play as one with potential to bring attention to less familiar aspects of history. She pointed out that the story could serve as encouragement for young women, especially by highlighting the strength and leadership qualities of the protagonist. She added that although the story carries a strong message for women, it is a significant part of Yoruba heritage that everyone should be familiar with. Boluwatife Babalola, the publisher of the original text, commented on the relevance of the narrative in today's society. He observed that the story is a strong reminder that women's roles should not be limited to domestic expectations, which in most African contexts continue to be pervasive. He added that when given the right opportunities, women can play significant roles and make meaningful contributions to society. The audience was a mix of students, theater enthusiasts, and officials from within and outside the university community. The play was appreciated for its performance, elucidation, and cultural importance. As curtains fell and the audience reacted with appreciation, relevance of the play was apparent. Ooni Luwo is helping bring to the forefront a significant part of Yoruba history and opening space for reflection on the stories that have so far stood at the margin.

mov_08D0D3FCBE043FD417BD3038AEE08179,2025-07-03 00:02:55,en,WEB,"  Today, I watched a simple Christian movie called Princess Cut 3: Beauty to Ashes. No big-name actors. No flashy cinematography. No polished performances or perfect lighting. Just… simplicity. At first, I almost changed it. In my mind, I thought, What is this low-budget movie? I was tempted to scroll past it because, by the standards I've grown used to — the worldly standard — it didn't qualify as “entertaining.” But the Holy Spirit had picked this movie for me. I asked Him, Holy Spirit, what should I watch? And He led me, specifically, to this one. And now I understand why. The Lord began to show me something profound. “This is what it means when I say the things of God are simple.” We've been conditioned by the world to expect aesthetics over essence — to value glamour over godliness. In the world's movies, everything is polished: the actor is eloquent, the woman is flawless, the sets are lavish, and the dialogue is witty. But because of that polish, we often miss the point. We walk away remembering the actor's face, their outfit, or how well they cried — but not the message. But in the movie I watched today, I wasn't distracted by appearance. I wasn't captivated by performance. I was drawn into the story. Into the characters. Into their journey. And more than that — into what God was saying to me. Because when the distractions fall away, what remains is God. And the Holy Spirit began to show me — this is what has happened to the Church. The church has, in many ways, become like Hollywood. • The preacher preaches, and there's a drum roll. • He says one powerful phrase, and the choir responds with heavenly voices. • Smoke machines fill the room. • The lights are choreographed to match the moment. And yet… in all the drama, where is God? We leave talking about how “the pastor was on fire,” how “Sister Joyce danced,” how “Brother Thompson looked good in his new suit.” But did you see God? Because if the presence of the Lord was truly there — if the Word was truly piercing hearts — we wouldn't be so caught up in aesthetics. • We wouldn't notice if Susan wasn't wearing Gucci. • We wouldn't care if Thompson repeated his clothes. • We wouldn't be tracking who came late or who sat where. When the Spirit of God truly fills a place, everything else fades. You don't see men; you see God. You don't leave with gossip; you leave with conviction. You don't come out more entertained — you come out more transformed. 1 Samuel 16:7 NIV     But the LORD said to Samuel, “Do not consider his appearance or his height, for I have rejected him. The LORD does not look at the things people look at. People look at the outward appearance, but the LORD looks at the heart.” I realized that even my standard for movies had been worldly. And the Holy Spirit said:     “I am weaning you off that standard.” He wants to purify even the way we receive entertainment, because everything we consume either builds us up or distracts us. It either plants truth or plants deception. And so I ask myself — and maybe you should too:     • When last did a sermon transform you, instead of just excite you?..."

You weren't created to just survive your days. You weren't made to live on autopilot, counting down the hours and missing the moments that matter most. You can build something that aligns with your values. You can contribute to your family in a meaningful way. You can create options for your future. And yes, you can change the entire direction of your life. You don't need a perfect plan or a huge following. You need a made-up mind. You need courage. And you need to stop waiting for the “right time.” Because the opportunity might already be in front of you.

mov_C49DE3429C79E8FFA86CC3209093BF28,2025-07-03 01:06:25,en,WEB,"  The fashion industry is enormous, with the global fashion e-commerce market expected to exceed $820 billion this year. However, many brands still face challenges in providing seamless mobile shopping experiences. This is where a thoughtfully crafted fashion app plays a role, merging style and technology to meet customer needs while increasing sales. This article will guide you on how to create one that truly stands out. With years of experience assisting businesses in building apps using tools like React Native and AI, we understand what works and what doesnât. From modern features like virtual try-ons to intelligent wardrobe management systems, we've covered all the essentials for both beginners and seasoned professionals. Get ready to turn your idea into reality! Key Takeaways The global fashion e-commerce market may surpass $820 billion in 2023, positioning fashion apps as a promising opportunity. Features like virtual try-ons and AI tools increase user engagement. Virtual fitting rooms can cost $100,000â$300,000 but reduce returns and improve satisfaction. Major brands like Gucci already use this feature to improve shopping experiences. Use React Native for cross-platform development to save time and costs while reaching both iOS and Android users with one codebase. Testing takes up about 15%-20% of the app budget, while maintenance can range from $20,000-$50,000 annually for updates and bug fixes. Personalization features using AI increase conversions by 30%. Apps like SHEIN achieved growth through data-driven recommendations customized to customer preferences. Define Your Objectives and Target Audience Set clear goals before creating your fashion app. Are you aiming to increase online shopping, highlight eco-friendly clothing, or make user interaction with trendy outfits more appealing? For instance, the resale fashion market is thriving as shoppers gravitate toward sustainable options like second-hand clothes and recycled garments. Determine if your priorities align with these trends. Understand your audience. Are they young fashion enthusiasts constantly on their smartphones or busy adults seeking convenient wardrobe tools? Recognizing that 80% of e-commerce traffic originates from mobile users can help shape features like push notifications or virtual try-ons. Focus on regions such as Asia-Pacific, where interest in fashion apps continues to grow, especially in countries like India and China. [embedded content] Research and Analyze the Fashion App Market The global fashion e-commerce market could exceed $1.2 trillion by 2027, making it a rapidly growing space for mobile apps. Asia alone is predicted to see $147.3 billion growth in revenue between 2023 and 2027, highlighting strong regional opportunities. Examine trends like sustainable fashion and the increasing popularity of second-hand clothing markets, projected to grow by $100 billion by 2026. Analyze competitors offering virtual fitting rooms or AI features like style advisors. High user engagement often stems from features combining convenience with personalization, such as wardrobe management tools or smooth shopping experiences linking online stores to brick-and-mortar outlets. Numbers don't lie; explore the market before building your app! [embedded content] Key Features to Include in a Fashion App Your app requires engaging tools such as virtual try-ons, outfit suggestions, and a seamless shopping experienceâletâs break it all down! Personalized Recommendations Smart tools like AI make shopping more convenient and quicker. Apps like SHEIN rely on machine learning to analyze buying habits, increasing user interaction. This method contributed to their achievement of 261 million downloads. Customized recommendations can lead to a 30% higher conversion rate for e-commerce platforms. These functionalities provide more than just product suggestions. They create a sense of recognition for users by presenting items based on past preferences or trends they follow. Itâs not about guessing; itâs data-informed and meaningful, enhancing customer satisfaction with every click. Virtual Try-On Virtual try-on allows users to see how clothes appear without physically wearing them. With augmented reality, shoppers can preview outfits through their phones. This feature decreases the need for physical fitting rooms and assists online stores in increasing sales. It also minimizes returns since customers choose better-fitting items. Major brands like Gucci use AR to provide virtual fitting rooms on their apps...."

Here are 10 slang terms people are using right now—especially online—and how to use them without cringing. 1. Rizz     Meaning: Short for “charisma.” Basically, it's your flirting game. Use it like this: “He's got serious rizz—girls flock to him.” 2. Delulu     Meaning: Short for “delusional.” Used playfully when someone's out of touch with reality, especially in love. Use it like this: “I know he liked my story but I'm not gonna get delulu about it.” 3. Bet     Meaning: A casual way to say “okay” or “watch me.” Use it like this: “You can't finish that pizza.” / “Bet.” 4. Slaps     Meaning: Means something's amazing, usually music. Use it like this: “This new Drake track slaps.” 5. It's giving [X]     Meaning: Used to describe the vibe or aesthetic something gives off. Use it like this: “This outfit? It's giving CEO energy.” 6. Ate / Ate and left no crumbs     Meaning: Did something really well—usually about a performance or outfit. Use it like this: “She ate with that dress.” 7. No cap     Meaning: No lie. I'm being serious. Use it like this: “That was the best burger I've had, no cap.” 8. Mid     Meaning: Average. Not great, not terrible—just meh. Use it like this: “The film was kinda mid, not gonna lie.” 9. GOAT     Meaning: Greatest Of All Time. Classic internet acronym, still going strong. Use it like this: “Messi is the GOAT, no debate.” 10. Ick     Meaning: Something that instantly turns you off, especially in dating. Use it like this: “He clapped when the plane landed—instant ick.” How to Sound Natural – Tips to Avoid Sounding Try-Hard     Learning slang is one thing. Using it without sounding like you're doing a bad impression of a teenager? That's the real trick. Here's how to keep it cool:        1. Don't force it     If you wouldn't say it normally, don't shove it into your sentence just to sound trendy. Slang works best when it fits you. Bad: “That pasta absolutely slaps, bro.” Better: “Okay, that pasta slaps—did not expect that.” 2. Less is more     You don't need to drop five slang words in one message. Pick one that feels natural and stick with it...."

n12q6ae,2025-07-03 05:01:29,en,REDDIT,"  ""I got mine, now I don't care about others who are going through the same journey I did"". Nice one champ, real mature. Let me address your points on factual basis: 1. Australia's replacement rate is ~2.1, while fertility rate is ~1.5-1.6. So, migration is literally an economic need of the country. 2. Housing crisis, if you put it into context, can only be solved by increasing supply. You can't achieve it by incentivising property investment, allowing builders to hold vacant houses and land, and definitely not by curbing migration. 3. Social science and liberal arts degrees like language, history, culture etc do not run the economy. Today you might only allow international students in who want to study those, you'll end up having shortage in STEM, finance etc, which will be detrimental to economy. 4. Students studying engineering, medicine, social work etc have it easy already. Focusing only on those will saturate those fields and open up shortages in other fields. 5. The students with deep pockets buying gucci bags and paying hefty rents/fee are very small in number. Most are from 3rd world countries, struggling to make ends meet. Most of your concerns lack empathy and even logic. If you really want to talk about actual issues, here are some ideas: 1. lack of effort by migrants to integrate with the society and respect rules and culture here 2. International students hopping courses just to get an easy and quick pathway to PR 3. After getting PR, people not working in their field or related ones, resulting in shortage remaining unaddressed. We know most drive uber after getting PR anyways. Don't even get me started on housing. Your argument about internationals outbidding locals just because they can afford to is just an emotional one. Why are Australians so obsessed with property investment? Real estate is literally the most unproductive asset, yet an entire generation and the next is brainwashed in to thinking this is their only shot at living a comfortable life. Why are boomers and millennials holding multiple investment properties? Why does property investment get a tax benefit? Why policies like negative gearing even exist in a country that is struggling with housing issue, when we know it only encourages people to literally hoard houses? No offence mate, but it is really time that we talk about the actual issues and stop hating each other."

While traditional luxury department stores like Macy's and Bloomingdale's exist, off-price retailers like Ross Stores, Inc., The TJX Companies, Inc. TJX Canada – Winners, Marshalls, HomeSense have continued to gain market share, often outpacing department stores in sales growth. This dynamic underscores a crucial point: consumers are actively seeking value and accessibility, yet my experience shows that outlet goods often compromise on quality, with poor stitches and lack of longevity.

Theo cáo trạng, đầu năm 2021, bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương bắt đầu kinh doanh online các mặt hàng cao cấp như thực phẩm chức năng, mỹ phẩm, túi xách, nước hoa, đồng hồ... từ các thương hiệu nổi tiếng như Hermes, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Versace... Để có vốn mở rộng quy mô kinh doanh, từ tháng 3/2021, Phương kêu gọi vợ chồng Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh cùng góp vốn đầu tư. Cả ba lập nhóm chat có tên ""KIM MONOLOLY GROUP"" trên ứng dụng Viber để giao dịch. Sau đó, Phương tự lập các đơn hàng, ghi rõ ngày đi - ngày về và mức lãi suất cao (từ 10% đến 100%) để kêu gọi vốn từ Long, Trinh và những người thân quen của họ. Mỗi đơn hàng có giá trị từ 10 triệu đồng đến hơn 4 tỷ đồng. Các bị cáo tại phiên toà. Việc góp vốn diễn ra suôn sẻ, lợi nhuận cao khiến nhiều người tiếp tục tham gia. Vợ chồng Long và Trinh còn hạ mức lãi suất cho các nhà đầu tư cấp dưới để hưởng chênh lệch từ mức lãi suất mà Phương cam kết. Tuy nhiên, sau một thời gian, hoạt động kinh doanh thua lỗ, hàng hóa không tiêu thụ được khiến Phương mất khả năng chi trả. Để tiếp tục duy trì dòng tiền và trả lãi cho các đơn cũ, bị cáo này lập các đơn hàng giả với lãi suất cao để lôi kéo nhà đầu tư mới, thực chất là chiếm đoạt tiền. Từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, Phương đã huy động vốn thông qua 1.158 đơn hàng, nhận tổng cộng 505,16 tỷ đồng, đã tất toán 990 đơn hàng với lãi suất hơn 91,39 tỷ đồng. Còn lại 168 đơn hàng chưa tất toán, tương ứng 112,3 tỷ đồng. Sau khi trừ phần lãi đã trả, số tiền Phương chiếm đoạt thực tế là 20,3 tỷ đồng. Số tiền này được Phương sử dụng vào các mục đích cá nhân như thuê nhà, thuê kho bãi, vận chuyển hàng hóa, xoay vòng dòng tiền và tiêu xài. Đến ngày 12/4/2022, Phương chính thức tuyên bố mất khả năng thanh toán. Riêng đối với Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh, quá trình điều tra cho thấy, từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, 2 bị cáo này sử dụng tiền cá nhân, tiền của người thân và tiền của các nhà đầu tư để đầu tư cho Phương. Đáng chú ý, ngay trước thời điểm Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ, ngày 12/4/2022, Phương vẫn gửi 12 đơn hàng với lãi suất từ 6% đến 25% để Long và Trinh tiếp tục huy động vốn. 3 người đầu tư là anh Nguyễn Tiến Phương 500 triệu đồng, chị Ngô Thị Diệu Lý 850 triệu đồng và anh Trần Hùng 794 triệu đồng. Tuy nhiên, chỉ vài giờ sau, Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ. Vợ chồng Long, Trinh chỉ hoàn trả lại cho anh Trần Hùng toàn bộ số tiền đã góp nhưng không thông báo cho chị Lý và anh Phương, cũng không trả lại số tiền 1,35 tỷ đồng mà đã chiếm đoạt để sử dụng cá nhân. Ngoài ra, sau khi Phương mất khả năng chi trả, vợ chồng Long, Trinh đã bán căn nhà ở số 4/8 Phạm Ngọc Thạch, Tp.Huế với giá 4,3 tỷ đồng để trả nợ cho người thân nhưng vẫn không hoàn trả số tiền 1,35 tỷ đồng cho chị Lý và anh Phương. Tại phiên tòa, 3 bị cáo thành khẩn khai báo, ăn năn hối hận về hành vi của mình, các bị cáo xin HĐXX cho được hưởng mức án nhẹ nhất để sớm trở về với gia đình. Sau khi nghị án, HĐXX tuyên phạt bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương 14 năm tù về tội Lừa đảo chiếm đoạt tài sản, bị cáo Phạm Thanh Long 5 năm tù và Nguyễn Thu Trinh 3 năm 6 tháng tù về tội Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản.

As the industry's model for working with public figures shifts, the power dynamics are becoming increasingly unclear. On Friday in Paris, the Northern Irish designer Jonathan Anderson will show his first collection as the creative director of the French fashion house Dior. During his previous, 11-year tenure as the creative director of the Spanish brand Loewe, Anderson became known for his avant-garde sensibility and dedication to craft -- but also for his unique ability to turn the internet's so-called boyfriends (those young actors and musicians who are lusted over online with possessive familiarity) into bona fide celebrities. In the front row of Anderson's fall 2024 Loewe men's wear show in Paris were the established actors Jamie Dornan, Andrew Garfield and Nicholas Hoult, but also, seated with equal prominence, emerging ones, including Drew Starkey, who was set to star in ''Queer'' (the 2024 Luca Guadagnino movie for which Anderson oversaw the costumes), and Josh O'Connor and Mike Faist, who would soon appear as romantic leads in Guadagnino's film ''Challengers,'' a film that helped them reach mainstream heartthrob status, and with which Anderson was also involved as a costume designer. The following June, at Anderson's final Loewe men's runway show, the rising actors Kit Connor, Evan Peters and Enzo Vogrincic sat front row -- suggesting, based on the strength of the designer's track record, that they too would also soon become leading men. For Loewe, it was a display of cultural currency; for the actors, it was free publicity. It used to be that an association with a brand was, if not a career-killer, then certainly not chic for an actor. It was hard to be taken seriously as both an artist and a de facto fashion model. But in recent decades, the rise of social media and the expansion of the fashion industry have blurred the lines between model, actor and influencer. Back in the 1980s, the Italian fashion house Armani began dressing Hollywood celebrities, including, most notably, Richard Gere for his role in the 1980 movie ''American Gigolo.'' But gone are the days when one megastar served as a company's global face. Today brands adopt a multitiered system of ambassadors that includes international stars, yes, but also up-and-comers and influencers. While these cliques are often described by their members and parent brands as ''family,'' and frequently represent a genuine affinity, they are also carefully constructed to maximize a company's exposure on red carpets and billboards -- but also very specific corners of TikTok. Now, as this business decision solidifies into standard practice, the question is, Who ultimately wields the power, the celebrities or the brands? Until 2010, ''a few brands had ambassadors, but it was mainly for fragrance,'' says Ben Cercio, the founder of a consulting agency specializing in brand strategy and communications with clients including the French fashion house Givenchy. But with the launch of Instagram that year, a shift occurred: companies began to engage not just with major actors but also with ''microinfluencers'' -- online personalities with less than 100,000 followers -- to reach their audiences early on. And because social media has accelerated the rise to fame, whenever a new talent in any field emerges from the crowd, ''every brand wants to get its hands on them,'' says Cercio. Now an ingénue like the actress Mikey Madison, who starred in last year's ''Anora,'' might have a dozen offers from brands immediately after making a buzzy debut at a festival like Cannes, suggesting that it's often the young actors, rather than the brands, who are in control. When Madison accepted her Oscar for best lead actress in March, she wore a custom look from Dior. Cercio adds that while relationships once developed organically -- a talent would come to a fashion show, be given some pieces and maybe wear something from the latest collection on the red carpet -- increasingly, ''money is very quickly involved.'' Indeed, an ambassadorship is now a coveted deal among celebrities of all tiers. '' There's enough proof in the market of just how great a partnership can look,'' says George Georgopoulos, the director of brand partnerships at Huxley, an agency that represents artists including Charli XCX. After releasing her globally successful album ''Brat,'' last summer, the pop star partnered with companies from H&M to Acne Studios and performed with a seemingly empty Gucci bag on ''Saturday Night Live'' in what appeared to be a wink-wink placement. (She'd headlined the brand's annual LACMA Gala a few weeks before.) Getting a check for simply holding an object, she seemed to imply, was not selling out but making the system work for her. For many celebrities, ''there's more money in the ambassadorship than in a lot of the payments they receive for their work onscreen,'' says the writer and pop culture podcaster Evan Ross Katz. Those funds can free up major actors to pursue less commercial projects, like indie films and plays; they are also increasingly essential for younger performers who aren't yet earning large sums for their creative work. Depending on their level of fame, a celebrity can make anywhere from $50,000 to many millions of dollars with endorsement deals, according to several people who work on confidential contracts. On the lower end are social media posts: An artist with a significant following could be paid $100,000 to $150,000 for a single main-grid post holding a product and tagging a brand. If their following is in the multiple millions, however, these numbers can reach seven figures, one stylist said. Slightly more lucrative are red-carpet appearances. And on the higher end are elaborate contracts that require more than just showing up at Fashion Week twice a year. A deal worth around $3 million, for example, could involve appearing in advertising campaigns, attending events like store openings, being dressed for the red carpet, wearing the brand out more casually for paparazzi shots and creating several social media posts. The prestige of an endorsement deal can also boost the cachet of a relatively unknown artist or internet personality immeasurably. Katz cites the YouTuber Emma Chamberlain and the pop star Addison Rae as two recent examples of social media stars whose fame has grown well beyond their original audience, partly because of their fashion partnerships. Since 2019, Chamberlain has been an ambassador for Louis Vuitton; last year, Rae appeared in a campaign film for Saint Laurent. Likewise, while celebrity ambassadors might not necessarily move units for brands in the short term -- unless they have the influence of a Kardashian or a Hadid -- they give companies exposure to niche but devoted audiences. By putting the actor Jeremy Allen White on a billboard, for example, Calvin Klein helped transform a nascent sex symbol into the kind of established idol the brand more typically casts -- and it got to be a part of the cultural conversation following the success of White's show ''The Bear.'' And when, last summer, Marc Jacobs recruited the viral TikTok chef Nara Smith to ''make'' one of the brand's tote bags from baking ingredients in a tongue-in-cheek video, Smith gained fashion credibility, while the brand got to create a social media moment of its own. Both parties signaled that they were in on the joke. But not all relationships are the right match. '' I remember this desire for fashion to lead the conversation and not follow it,'' says Katz. '' Part of me worries that that's beginning to shift.'' Still, brands are continuing to experiment with new models..."

mov_BBD17E676118387CC472D6362B0C53CC,2025-07-03 08:17:03,en,WEB,"  After Italian luxury brand Prada sparked outrage for showcasing sandals that closely resembled India's traditional Kolhapuri chappals, without initially giving credit, Edelweiss Mutual Fund's CEO and MD, Radhika Gupta, has shared her strong views on the matter. In a passionate LinkedIn post, Gupta didn't hold back. Calling out the price difference, she wrote: “Rs 500 chappal sold for Rs 1 lakh, without any credit!” Her comment was aimed directly at Prada's newly launched sandals, which appeared at Milan Fashion Week and looked almost identical to the handcrafted Kolhapuris, typically made in Maharashtra and Karnataka. Own your handlooms, own your narrative: Radhika Gupta Gupta, a known promoter of Indian handlooms, used the moment to highlight a larger issue, the lack of recognition for Indian craftsmanship on the global stage. ""This is why I'm obsessed with wearing and talking about handlooms,"" she wrote. ""Every child knows who Prada and Gucci are, but very few in a room know a Himroo, Sambalpuri or Narayanpet."" For her, preserving India's textile legacy isn't just about fashion, it's about owning our culture and story. She ended her post with a powerful African proverb: ""Till the lion learns to write, all stories will glorify the hunter."" Backlash that made Prada respond The row began when Prada released its open-toe, braided leather sandals at fashion week, with no mention of Indian roots. Social media users and fashion critics quickly pointed out the sandals' striking resemblance to Kolhapuris, which have been worn in India for generations.Facing growing criticism, Prada issued a statement to the BBC, saying the sandals were ""inspired by traditional Indian footwear"" and that the brand ""celebrates craftsmanship, heritage, and design traditions."" The company also said it had reached out to the Maharashtra Chamber of Commerce, Industry & Agriculture.Inputs from agencies"

mov_2A60E065627A5AE2BA62E6E4C6BDD7F0,2025-07-03 09:02:40,bg,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[bg]Емануела е широко познато на българската аудитория и името й често споменавано от години, било то заради нова песен, скандален аутфит или драма около личния й живот. Този път тя отново се завъртя в медийното пространство, но не по обичайния начин. Причината? Появата на бившия й партньор Мартин в риалити предаването „Ергенът“. Макар самата тя да няма нищо общо с шоуто, присъствието му там се превърна в прожектор, насочен и към нея - с всички съпътстващи го коментари, догадки и мемета, които заляха социалните мрежи. Но докато някои търсят драма, тя продължава да прави това, което умее най-добре - да изглежда точно така, както иска. Емануела и представата на „естественото“ „Красивият човек е естественият човек! “ и „Когато си супер естествен, това винаги се забелязва и неминуемо оставяш приятно впечатление в хората.“ – това са нейни думи от интервюта, още от началото на кариерата и (2010). Но днес не е тайна за никой, че външният й вид е далеч от натурален. И това не е укор, а факт. Емануела е поддържана и във визията и няма никаква случайност, а стил с концепция. Разгледай онлайн нашите промоционални брошури Цените са валидни за периода на акцията или до изчерпване на наличностите. Всички цени са в лева с включен ДДС. В свят, в който всяка жена сама избира как да изглежда, тя просто играе играта по собствените си правила. Не крие естетическите си намеси - филъри, скули, устни. И ако за някои това е фалш, за нея е просто избор. Избор, който прави със самочувствие. А и природата все пак е оставила нещо, което не подлежи на корекции - студения й, хипнотизиращ поглед. Очите й - светли, ясни, създаващи дистанция с този, когото гледат. Те казват онова, което тя няма нужда да произнесе. Стилът й - дива на сцената, дама в ежедневието На сцената стилът й е драматичен, сексапилен и запомнящ се.  Пайети, латекс, злато, сребро, високи ботуши, драматични цепки и още по- скандални деколтета – сценичните и визии не просто впечатляват, те доминират. Емануела знае какво е сцена - арена, на която или сияеш, или си невидим. И тя никога не избира второто. В една от скорошните си фотосесии Емануела се появи в черна pокля на Louise Vuitton с масивен златен цип, който преминава през цялата и дължина. Силуетът е смел, деколтето дълбоко, а ефектът - изцяло в контрола (или пк гърдите) на жената. Това не е просто визия, а демонстрация на стил, увереност и сценично присъствие. А в ежедневието? Там Емануела преминава към по-градската естетика - casual glam. Често виждаме спортни сетове с логото на Gucci или Louise Vuitton, комбинирани с oversized очила, перфектен маникюр и чанта, която говори сама по себе си. Стайлингът й винаги е планиран дори когато изглежда „небрежен“. Любими марки? Giovanni, Louise Luitton, Valentino Garavani, Dolce & Gabbana, Herve Leger, както и български дизайнери, с които създава по-персонализирани визии. Скандалите като част от естетиката Истинската особеност при Емануела не е дали около нея има скандали - а как ги използва за имиджа си. Вместо да се защитава, или да влиза в обяснителен режим, тя създава стил около собственото си мълчание. Няколко думи на story в Инстаграм и още няколко намека са достатъчни. Публичният образ при нея е изграден като high fashion колекция - с ясна посока, съзнателна театралност и умерена провокация. Скандалът никога не е цел, а инструмент. Инструмент, с който тя подсилва присъствието си, без да загуби контрол. А когато е необходимо - тя просто се отдръпва, сменя фона, сменя кадъра - и остава недосегаема. Не просто фолк, а фигура със стойност Емануела никога не е била безобидна фигура в попфолка – и това е част от присъствието й. С времето стилът й се е променил - понякога рязко, понякога очаквано, но винаги с ясно усещане за контрол на образа. Може да не се харесва на всички, но рядко остава незабелязана - и това само по себе си казва достатъчно. Повече за Емануела - вижте във видеото Последвайте ladyzone.bg във FACEBOOK..."

Cáo trạng của VKSND TP Huế cho hay, đầu năm 2021, Phương bắt đầu kinh doanh online các mặt hàng thực phẩm chức năng, mỹ phẩm, túi xách, nước hoa, đồng hồ... từ nhiều thương hiệu nổi tiếng như Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Chanel, Hermes, Versace... Phương đã kêu gọi vợ chồng Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh cùng góp vốn đầu tư. Cả 3 người lập nhóm chat “Kim Monololy Group” trên ứng dụng Viber để giao dịch. Phương tự lập các đơn hàng, ghi rõ ngày đi, ngày về và mức lãi suất cao (từ 10% đến 100%) để kêu gọi vốn từ Long, Trinh và những người thân quen. Mỗi đơn hàng có giá trị cao từ 10 triệu đồng đến hơn 4 tỷ đồng. Nhiều người đã tham gia góp vốn kinh doanh online cùng Phương. Sau một thời gian, hoạt động kinh doanh thua lỗ, hàng hóa không tiêu thụ được khiến Phương mất khả năng chi trả. Nhằm tiếp tục duy trì dòng tiền và trả lãi cho các đơn cũ, Phương lập các đơn hàng giả với lãi suất cao để lôi kéo nhà đầu tư mới, thực chất là chiếm đoạt tiền. Trong thời gian từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, Phương đã huy động vốn thông qua 1.158 đơn hàng, nhận tổng cộng 505,16 tỷ đồng. Phương đã tất toán 990 đơn hàng với lãi suất hơn 91,39 tỷ đồng. Còn lại 168 đơn hàng chưa tất toán, tương ứng 112,3 tỷ đồng. Sau khi trừ phần lãi đã trả, số tiền Phương chiếm đoạt thực tế là 20,3 tỷ đồng. Số tiền này được Phương sử dụng vào các mục đích cá nhân như thuê nhà, thuê kho bãi, vận chuyển hàng hóa, xoay vòng dòng tiền và tiêu xài cá nhân. Đến ngày 12/4/2022, Phương tuyên bố mất khả năng thanh toán. 3 bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương, Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh tại phiên tòa sơ thẩm. (Ảnh: M.N) Riêng với Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh, từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, đã dùng tiền cá nhân, tiền của người thân và tiền của các nhà đầu tư để đầu tư cho Phương. Hai bị cáo này đã nhận tiền từ anh Nguyễn Tiến Phương 500 triệu đồng, chị Ngô Thị Diệu Lý 850 triệu đồng và anh Trần Hùng 794 triệu đồng. Long và Trinh chỉ hoàn trả lại cho anh Trần Hùng toàn bộ số tiền đã góp, còn chị Lý và anh Phương không được hoàn lại số tiền tổng 1,35 tỷ đồng. Hội đồng xét xử Tòa án nhân dân TP Huế đã tuyên phạt Lê Thị Hồng Phương 14 năm tù về tội “Lừa đảo, chiếm đoạt tài sản”; Phạm Thanh Long 5 năm tù và Nguyễn Thu Trinh 3 năm 6 tháng tù về tội “Lạm dụng tín nhiệm, chiếm đoạt tài sản”."

  一、精准招募：定位潜力主播群体 
   目标人群画像高校学生：Z世代用户占比高，内容创作活跃，可通过校园合作、社团赞助等方式招募。 垂直领域KOC：如游戏、美妆、健身等领域的达人，粉丝粘性强，变现潜力高。 本土网红：与洛杉矶、纽约等地的MCN机构合作，引入专业演员、歌手，提升内容专业度。 招募渠道创新社交媒体：在Instagram、Twitter等平台发起“寻找TikTok新星”活动，提供流量扶持承诺。 线下活动：参与西南偏南（SXSW）音乐节、E3游戏展等，挖掘现场表演者。 数据工具：利用TikTok Creator Marketplace筛选粉丝画像匹配的主播，提高招募效率。 二、系统化培训：提升主播专业能力 
   技能培训体系直播技巧：话术设计、互动引导、节奏把控，例如“3秒留人法则”提升观众停留时长。 内容创作：结合北美热点（如超级碗、黑五）策划主题内容，利用AI生成爆款标题与标签。 合规意识：培训COPPA（儿童隐私保护法）、DMCA（数字千年版权法）等法规，避免违规封号。 个性化发展路径垂直领域深耕：为游戏主播提供赛事解说资源，为美妆主播对接品牌合作。 IP孵化计划：针对高潜力主播，制定“3个月百万粉”计划，投入DOU+流量扶持。 三、科学化管理：构建长效合作机制 
   合同与分成设计灵活分成模式：根据主播等级设定阶梯式分成比例（如S级主播拿40%流水），激励主播提升业绩。 竞业条款：约定独家合作期限，避免主播流失至竞争对手。 绩效考核与激励关键指标：设定观看时长、互动率、GMV等KPI，每月评估并调整资源分配。 奖励机制：对超额完成目标的主播提供额外奖金、品牌资源或线下活动曝光机会。 风险管控内容审查：建立三级审核机制，避免主播发布违规内容。 舆情监控：利用Meltwater等工具实时追踪负面舆情，及时响应处理。 四、资源整合：拓展变现与合作生态 
   品牌与电商合作联合营销：与Gucci、Netflix等品牌推出“皇室同款”“Cobra Kai Chop”主题直播，提升品牌曝光。 直播带货：对接Amazon Live、Shopify等平台，提供“直播+仓储+物流”一站式服务，缩短履约时效。 行业生态联动MCN机构合作：与美国头部MCN（如HYBE、VSPN）共享主播资源，联合打造跨平台IP。 技术赋能：引入AI数字人主播技术，实现24小时不间断直播，降低人力成本。 五、成功案例与模式借鉴 
   案例一：某公会通过“校园星计划”招募高校主播，3个月内孵化出5名百万粉达人，单场直播打赏收入超10万美元。 案例二：与Netflix合作推出《眼镜蛇凯伊》主题直播，结合AR滤镜技术，单场参与人数超50万，打赏收入破百万美元。 案例三：通过AI生成“美式脱口秀”内容，单月曝光量破亿次，粉丝增长超30%。 总结：北美公会签约主播资源搭建需围绕“精准招募-系统培训-科学管理-资源整合”四大核心展开。 通过定位潜力主播群体、构建个性化发展路径、设计灵活分成机制、拓展品牌合作生态，可有效提升主播质量与留存率，增强公会变现能力与市场竞争力。"

If you are rich, this is another story of course. But not everybody is rich."

mov_A986EFED089A25647B47F564C0704568,2025-07-03 11:23:02,en,WEB,"  You open Instagram. A dancing mango floats by, followed by a fish in high heels, whispering brand slogans. Shah Rukh Khan levitates near a beach, eating parathas with a third hand sprouting from his shoulder. A washing machine flashes its teeth. A child with neon eyes stares into your soul and says, “Moisturise or perish.” You swipe up. You have absolutely no idea what you just witnessed. No, this isn't a fever dream. It's advertising today. Surrealism, once confined to arthouse films and niche magazines, is now front and centre in brand storytelling. Globally, big brands are tossing the old playbook. Gucci is making its models float mid-air, while Diesel has a freakish-style house. These ads are starting to look more like hallucinations than product promotions. Burberry made a film called 'Night Creatures' where people on a night walk get picked up by a mysterious creature and float in the air. Weird, absurd, and nothing to do with the brand. [embedded content] “People are tired of seeing the same kind of content every day”, says Rohan Mukherjee, Co-founder of byooooob. “Surrealism feels fresh because it's unpredictable… it reflects the kind of chaos we experience online and offline.” [embedded content] It's not just visual chaos for chaos's sake, it's intentional. Surrealism disorients, then delights. It mirrors the fragmented way we consume media, fast, fractured, and emotion-first. A LinkedIn column by Sami Viitamäki argues that “nonsense marketing” is outperforming traditional logic-led storytelling because it allows for deeper engagement through emotion, humour, and intrigue. “Surrealism offers us a gateway into our subconscious, a portal into dreams,” adds Shai Samantey, Co-founder & Director at Jungle. “Exploring these realms… gives one a bigger canvas to create.” [embedded content] What is driving this shift? One reason for this visual shift is technology. AI has cracked open surrealism's gate, allowing more creators to play in dreamlike, illogical spaces. Midjourney, DALL·E and Runway lets creators make bizarre visions without needing heavy design or VFX. “AI made surreal visuals more accessible. Anyone with an idea can create strange, dreamlike images without needing to know design software,” says Mukherjee. Samantey agrees, “As filmmakers, anything in our wildest imagination can now be brought to life. AI not only helps you build your vision but also reimagines it in ways you may not have seen before.” But not everyone sees AI as the magic bullet. “We are just scratching the surface. Even our most advanced AI models are nowhere near the complexity of the human brain,” says Ram Madhvani, Co-founder, Director, and Producer at Equinox Films. Pranoy Kanojia, VP Strategy, Enormous Brands, adds, “AI has supercharged this. The aesthetics of brain rot have improved, blurring the lines of absurd and real.” There's even a name for this online explosion of weird, AI-crafted content: AI Slop — a genre built on bizarre juxtapositions and visual overload, engineered to keep you scrolling. And young audiences, especially Gen Z, are leaning into it. Mukherjee says, “Mostly younger audiences who are online a lot. They're used to content that moves fast, breaks rules, and doesn't always make sense on the surface. Surrealism speaks to that mindset — it's emotional, visual, and leaves space for interpretation. “At the end of the day, we are all dreamers,” adds Samantey. “A good piece of content that uses surrealism can be appreciated and consumed by all audiences.” Studies support this. According to a YPulse survey, 73% of Gen Z actively seek 'visually bold, weird, or unexpected' content. Data from Kantar's 2024 Creative Effectiveness Awards also adds a strategic layer, ads with 'Bizarrely Bold' visuals like Deliveroo's surreal 'Octoman' featuring an octopus on a date via delivery, consistently outperform for attention and memorability.

n13xatr,2025-07-03 11:28:48,en,REDDIT,"  Congratulations. I used to work for Express 2 years ago. I quit to try different things and now I am back. Currently doing the training videos like you. They suck. Anyway, don't listen to the crybabies in this post. Everyone has different experiences. Most of them are old-timers who are used to doing their old routes and get mad at change. Yes, now express drivers pick up ground freight. Maybe deliver some too but for $21.24 it's an easy job. All of the trucks have AC otherwise they ground them. There are time commitments but most are doable if you plan your route properly. You get paid for holidays. Have a set schedule. Overtime after 40 hours instead of after 8 hours now. It's a pretty chill job. Better than most driving positions out there. The lazy drivers will complain because they are used to doing 40 stops in a day at a turtle pace and they took their essy residential routes. My station is converting to 2.0 in September but no major changes. Country routes will be handled by ground. Some ground drivers will transfer to my station to cover those and some express routes will be converted to ground. If you are hired as express, then you are Gucci."

Но днес не е тайна за никой, че външният й вид е далеч от натурален. И това не е укор, а факт. Емануела е поддържана и във визията и няма никаква случайност, а стил с концепция. В свят, в който всяка жена сама избира как да изглежда, тя просто играе играта по собствените си правила. Не крие естетическите си намеси - филъри, скули, устни. И ако за някои това е фалш, за нея е просто избор. Избор, който прави със самочувствие. А и природата все пак е оставила нещо, което не подлежи на корекции - студения й, хипнотизиращ поглед.

Емануела знае какво е сцена - арена, на която или сияеш, или си невидим. И тя никога не избира второто.

Силуетът е смел, деколтето дълбоко, а ефектът - изцяло в контрола (или пк гърдите) на жената. Това не е просто визия, а демонстрация на стил, увереност и сценично присъствие. А в ежедневието?

Публичният образ при нея е изграден като high fashion колекция - с ясна посока, съзнателна театралност и умерена провокация. Скандалът никога не е цел, а инструмент. Инструмент, с който тя подсилва присъствието си, без да загуби контрол. А когато е необходимо - тя просто се отдръпва, сменя фона, сменя кадъра - и остава недосегаема.

mov_F55D408386C0001BCB4B07BB43E82F95,2025-07-03 13:09:39,en,WEB,"  On July 4 last summer, Brittany Mahomes found a slice of America in London's Hyde Park, swaying to Morgan Wallen's country drawl beside husband, Patrick Mahomes. She captioned the night, “Country concert in London, count me in,” while Patrick's grey-white Prada set drew Travis Kelce's “Patty Prada!!!” Fans called it surreal—two NFL icons blending Nashville spirit with London twilight, proving patriotism sometimes sounds best amplified over a thousand cheering strangers abroad. Less than twenty-four hours later, Brittany shifted effortlessly from concert denim to polished elegance at Wimbledon's Centre Court. Her $6,000 Gucci ensemble—a crisp navy skirt and a red-white polo (shoutout to patriotic colors)—felt more deliberate than festive. Observers noted her understated caption, simply “Wimbledon,” though her heart-shaped crossbody bag spoke volumes. Taken all together, it was a study in contrasts: country music's rowdy nostalgia one night, refined American poise the next, each moment distinctly hers. Fast forward to this year's 4th of July week, and Brittany is back at it. Though this time, instead of London and Wimbledon, she captured America's essence in her driveway when a real-life bald eagle stalked her driveway. “Have you ever had a bald eagle on your porch?” Brittany wrote in her story, capturing a short clip of the National Bird. What followed was a continuous update on the bald bird from Brittany's side, which later turned out to be a mom-eagle delivering food to her babies. “Hey dude,” she added. “What's up? He has made himself right at home.” In her next story, Brittany caught the eagle, finally getting the dinner. “Update: he's caught his dinner,” she wrote. A few moments later, the Chiefs' quarterback's partner came back with the next update, writing, “Next update: has to be the mom delivering dinner to her babies.” Well, at one moment or another, it might feel like she's narrating a wildlife documentary. But nope. She was just cheekily embracing the moment. After all, ahead of the 4th of July, Brittany catching an eagle on her driveway felt like an almost cinematic nod to the holiday. But we can't deny the fact that she's living out her worst nightmare. Brittany Mahomes wants to pet the National Bird Patrick, Brittany, and the Chiefs have had a bunch of Eagles this year, and the memories are still fresh. Just earlier this year, the Eagles swooped in and thrashed the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIX. Giving them a blowout loss of 40-22 and shattering their dreams of achieving a historic three-peat. Count Mahomes getting sacked six times, and it was a total nightmare (also finishing with 257 yards, three touchdowns). Fast forward to now, and whether it's a coincidence or a divine intervention, an eagle has found the Mahomes household again. Though this time not on the gridiron, but at their driveway. What are the odds? But this time, rather than embracing the harsh Super Bowl loss to the Eagles, Brittany is intentionally making the jokes way too easy. In one of her Instagram stories, she shared a bright picture of the bald eagle, giving a side look to her, as she wrote, “Think I could teach it how to attack on command.” The Mahomes already have two pet dogs named Steel (a Pit Bull) and Silver (a Cane Corso). Steel was a Valentine's Day gift from Patrick to Brittany in college. And now? Well, picture Brittany commanding a pet eagle. Well, that moment would surely feel like a symbolic nod given the Chiefs' loss in the Super Bowl to the Eagles in February this year. But at the end of the day, it's safe to say that Brittany Mahomes is probably taking the jokes lightheartedly in her stories. The Chiefs are now gearing up for the 2025 season and are set to face the Eagles in the second week of the regular season."

Sony is like the zara/gucci brand of video games. So much money and hype poured into their products with little to no substance and they still somehow manage to generate revenues and praise it's quite fascinating to say the least. like i previously mentioned.

18062164309981345,2025-07-03 16:30:41,en,INSTAGRAM,"  “House of Gucci” (2021), one of the film's pivotal moments comes when Patrizia Reggiani, played by Lady Gaga, first learns about the fake Gucci products circulating in the market, not through boardroom whispers, but from her maid. This seemingly casual revelation ignites Patrizia's fury. She later confronts Aldo Gucci (Al Pacino), expressing her outrage that counterfeit goods are tarnishing the family legacy. But Aldo, ever the businessman, brushes off her concerns, arguing that the replicas only fuel desire and boost brand recognition. This fictionalized moment reflects a very real and growing problem in the luxury world. The global counterfeit market is estimated to be worth between $1.7 and $4.5 trillion a year. For heritage brands like Gucci, it's not just about lost sales, counterfeits chip away years of craftsmanship, prestige, and trust. The damage is especially visible among younger consumers, who, driven by social media trends and influencer culture, often opt for knockoffs to mimic a luxurious lifestyle without the price tag. To fight back, luxury houses are embracing cutting-edge tech, from AI-powered tracking tools and embedded microchips to blockchain based authentication. Online resale platforms like Vinted and eBay are also tightening their verification processes. Still, counterfeiters are evolving just as quickly, forcing the industry to stay two steps ahead to protect its name and future.

Black and white advice like ""never do this"" will never work cause some company will be the outlier and that story will inevitably make its way into the comment section of a post like this. Typically, I dont mention vacation plans unless asked, and i have been asked that in interviews. One place said it was totally fine and hired me and everything was Gucci. My partner on the other hand was not asked that in his interview and then let them know like 2 weeks into the job (2 weeks before we left) snd they got really snippy with him about how inconvenient it was and that they had a policy of no vacations in your first 30 days. He clapped back that theyre the ones who didnt bother asking in the interview and it actually did shut them up and he still works there. Also, ""at will"" doesn't mean they can terminate for no reason, there HAS to be a reason. Now, the reason can absolutely be a lie, but then you'd need to prove it and we all know what a joke the US legal system can be."

I actually tried going about refunding it, but after being on the phone with Support, four different times, three of which I couldn't actually talk to them on the phone because after they remove the batch, I could only text them. But they all attempted to get me to refund the item at each time. I walked back into Sephora, the manager would tell me that something would have to be completed on their end to start the return I think since the Customer was rescheduling the order it wasn't processing the return. Eventually, after being on the chat window with them for about an hour and three different support agents they just told me to dispose or donate the item it's $150 perfume. I'm a single guy I have no use for this item but I wanna make sure that I won't be held accountable.

mov_804D451CE3431EED4CB70820B19CCE20,2025-07-03 19:22:18,en,WEB,"  Advertisement When dark eyeliner meets unapologetic artistry, magic happens. That's the spell casts across TikTok feeds and Instagram grids worldwide. Born Gabbriette Bechtel, this Los Angeles-based creative didn't just stumble into fame—she carved her throne in the digital underworld with razor-sharp aesthetics and genre-defying talent. From viral makeup transformations to fronting the synth-punk band NIGHT CLUB and collaborating with luxury giants like Gucci, Gabbriette's journey from underground artist to alt-culture icon proves that darkness holds irresistible power. Her rise mirrors a cultural shift where goth isn't just a subculture—it's a mainstream rebellion against beige minimalism, fueled by 1.7M Instagram devotees and Gen Z's hunger for authenticity. Gabbriette: The Gothic Muse Revolutionizing Alternative Fashion and Music Gabbriette's origin story reads like a Tim Burton screenplay meets Silicon Valley hustle. Born in 1996 and raised between California's sun-drenched coasts and Japan's Harajuku fashion epicenters, she absorbed contrasting worlds. Her mother—a former punk scenester—nurtured Gabbriette's early love for Siouxsie Sioux and Vivienne Westwood, while Tokyo's visual-kei scene taught her that fashion could be armor. At 16, she started documenting DIY fishnet-and-leather outfits on Tumblr, but her breakthrough came via TikTok during 2020's lockdown. A video of her transforming from “corporate drone” to “vampire CEO” using MAC Cosmetics exploded overnight, showcasing her signature look: porcelain skin, graphic liner sharp enough to cut glass, and blood-red lips. Her content strategy masterfully blends accessibility with mystique. Tutorials like “Cemetery Chic in 10 Minutes” democratize goth glamour, while moody photoshoots in abandoned mansions (often self-produced) feel like stills from a cult film. This duality fueled her follower surge—from 200K to 1M+ in under a year. Major milestones followed: starring in Gucci's 2022 “Twinsburg” campaign alongside surrealist doppelgängers, designing capsule collections for Killstar, and performing with NIGHT CLUB at Coachella's underground stages. Her secret? Treating social media as a curated gallery, not a diary. “Every post is a scene from my cinematic universe,” she told Vogue. “I'm not selling 'me'—I'm selling a fantasy you can step into.” The Aesthetic Blueprint: Goth Goes Global Gabbriette's style is a PhD in subcultural remix. She pairs Victorian mourning jewelry with cyberpunk platform boots, then layers them under thrifted band tees—a “historical collage” approach that's sparked micro-trends like “Renaissance Goth” and “AI Witchcore.” Her Instagram is a visual manifesto: crimson-lit selfies, graveyard picnics, and behind-the-scenes glimpses of photoshoots where she controls every detail, from set design to editing. This authenticity resonates; when fast fashion brands mimic her looks, followers rally with #GabbrietteOriginals. Her music amplifies her fashion ethos. As lead singer of NIGHT CLUB, she blends darkwave synths with lyrics about power and isolation—tracks like “Schizophrenic” and “Die in the Disco” soundtrack countless TikTok edits. Collaborations are strategic: indie designers like Dollskill for accessible pieces, versus high-art projects like sculptural headpieces with Alexander McQueen. The numbers prove her impact: 3.2M+ TikTok followers 87% engagement rate on Reels (vs. industry avg 5.7%) 40% spike in searches for “lace gloves” post-Gucci campaign Crucially, she leverages platforms differently: Instagram: High-fashion storytelling TikTok: Raw, voiceover-driven intimacy (“Why I Burned My Corporate Wardrobe”) Pinterest: Mood boards inspiring 500K+ user saves monthly Industry Disruption and Cultural Legacy Gabbriette's influence stretches beyond vanity metrics. She's shifted how brands approach alt audiences. After her Sephora collab sold out in 4 hours, beauty giants began prioritizing subculture-inspired collections. Music festivals now actively book goth/industrial acts, with NIGHT CLUB's touring revenue up 200% since 2021. Even academia took note; Yale's Fashion Studies department added her Gucci campaign to their “Subculture Semiotics” curriculum, highlighting how she reclaims goth from corporate co-option. Her advocacy work deepens her impact. She partners with The Trevor Project, using her platform to discuss mental health in alternative communities. When critics dismiss goth as “depressive,” she counters with data: her followers report 72% higher self-acceptance after engaging with her body-positive content. This duality—gloom as empowerment—defines her legacy. As she stated in an interview with Alternative Press, “My darkness isn't about sadness. It's about depth. It's saying the unsaid, wearing the unwearable, loving the unlovable.” Future Horizons: Beyond the Black Veil..."

n16lab9,2025-07-03 19:38:48,en,REDDIT,"  I think if Di Nardo lowered his prices by a landslide on his website (he has sales on other platforms) and stopped trying to copy brands like Gucci and Louis Vuitton and other designers and got his head out of his ass he'd be more popular. I remember seeing an image of his gloves from 2017 or some earlier year where his logo was a 1:1 of Grant Boxing. Also to note he has that 4 heart-clover shape tattooed on his face which is insane to me. As for the Instagram followers they are definitely bought and there is no argument against it, if he really did have 435,000 followers and a majority of them actively used Instagram, he would not have the response time to customer's inquiries that he does. (I've inquired him plenty of times before and have received instant replies at times). Also, I remember a commenter on BoxerBoutique onetime said ""Who would pay this much for gloves?"" with a laughing emoji or something similar about a Di Nardo WorldWide product. Then, Fillippo himself says that he is just jealous because he can't afford the gloves and dreams, he could live a luxurious lifestyle but instead stays behind a screen talking bad about others. Quite honestly, I was appalled and jokingly went on with the guy saying that (Commenter) was just jealous and wishes he had the opportunity to use them. Then it dawned on me, Di Nardo wasn't joking because he then made a whole Instagram account post AND story post about how anonymous users and fake accounts need to be deleted by Instagram, and they should encourage ONLY genuine and constructive posts which essentially defeats the purpose of his response to the commenter. They went back and forth and at some point I just said it wasn't this serious and they both agreed lol. I don't mean to shit on the guy because he is a high tier craftsman, and his leathers and gloves usually look stunning at the end of the day. But between the way he articulates and presents himself is just God awful and he needs to have a reality check."

The Storied Journey: Hudson's Bay Origins and Evolution The history of Hudson's Bay Company is inextricably linked to the very evolution of Canada itself. Chartered on May 2, 1670, by King Charles II of England, the “Governor and Company of Adventurers of England trading into Hudson's Bay” began as a fur trading enterprise. Its initial purpose was to establish a lucrative trade network for beaver pelts, primarily with Indigenous peoples across the vast watershed draining into Hudson Bay – territory granted by the charter and known as Rupert's Land. Early trading posts, like York Factory (founded 1684), became critical hubs. Key milestones defined its rise: 1670: Royal Charter granted, creating HBC. 1821: Merger with the rival North West Company, solidifying its dominance over the North American fur trade. 1869: Sale of Rupert's Land to the newly formed Dominion of Canada, shifting HBC's focus from land governance to retail and real estate. 1881: Opening of the first true department store in Winnipeg, Manitoba, marking the formal transition from fur trading to diversified retail. 1913: Launch of the iconic Hudson's Bay Point Blanket, originally a trade good, becoming a national symbol. 1960s-1970s: Rapid national expansion, acquiring other retailers like Zellers (1978) and establishing a coast-to-coast presence. 2008: Acquisition by NRDC Equity Partners, leading to significant restructuring and modernization efforts. 2010s-Present: Embracing digital transformation, launching HBC Global, expanding e-commerce, and focusing on premium retail experiences. This evolution wasn't linear. HBC navigated economic depressions, fierce competition (notably from Eaton's and Simpsons), and the decline of fur trading. Its survival and adaptation showcase remarkable resilience. The shift from trading posts to grand urban department stores in the late 19th and early 20th centuries was pivotal. Landmark stores like the Toronto Queen Street flagship (1930s) became architectural icons and community anchors. The acquisition strategy broadened its reach and brand portfolio, though managing these integrations presented challenges. The modern Hudson Bay Retail Innovations era, driven heavily by digital investment since the 2010s, represents the latest chapter in this centuries-long evolution , transforming the company from a traditional brick-and-mortar giant into an agile omnichannel leader. Key figures like Governor Sir George Simpson in the fur trade era and more recent CEOs like Richard Baker and Iain Nairn have steered its course through these transformative phases. Key Products and Services: Shaping Canadian Consumerism Hudson's Bay has profoundly shaped Canadian consumer behavior through its diverse and trendsetting product offerings . Its services extend beyond mere transactions, creating a comprehensive shopping ecosystem: Iconic & Best-Selling Products:   The Point Blanket: The quintessential Canadian symbol. Originally a wool trade blanket marked with distinctive black stripes, it remains a top seller, now extended into apparel, home décor, and collaborations. Its heritage drives enduring appeal. Exclusive Labels: HBC developed powerful private brands that defined quality and style for generations. Simpsons-Sears catalogs (post-1952 acquisition) brought affordable fashion to millions. Modern exclusives like Top of the World (outerwear), GlucksteinHome (luxury bedding and furniture), and HBC Collection (contemporary apparel and accessories) offer unique value and design...."

Fendi reintroduced their iconic Spy Bag on Thursday with a cinematic digital campaign starring Amelia Gray, Xiao Wen Ju, and Gabbriette. The 30-second video, photographed and directed by Stevie Dance and styled by Anna Trevelyan, follows the storyline of an underground collector tracking down the coveted accessory. The original Spy Bag was launched by Silvia Venturini Fendi in 2005 and quickly became a defining accessory of the 2000s. The signature design now returns, 20 years after its original release. Spy Bags, both original and new, feature a plush silhouette, twisted handles, and secret compartments that offer privacy in style. The new iteration boasts a few contemporary updates that brings the feeling of Y2K to 2025. Donatella Versace, who announced she would be stepping down from her position as Chief Creative Officer early this spring, launched her final ad campaign this week, starring veteran muses Kate Moss, Kristen McMenamy, Amber Valletta, Natasha Poly, and Claudia Schiffer, as well as newer faces like Anok Yai and Mica Argañaraz. The images and retro video clip feature Donatella's final Fall 2025 collection, and was shot by long-time collaborators Mert & Marcus. Former Miu Miu creative director Dario Vitale will succeed Donatella and stage his debut Versace show in September. The campaign symbolized a passing of the torch to Vitale, honoring the Versace of the past while also celebrating what's to come. “It was all about friendship, loyalty, and love. Every collection is a story, and this campaign is the story of Versace. Inspiring the present and anticipating the future,” Donatella said in a statement. Last week, Zimmermann's Cruise 2026 ready-to-wear Twisted Romance collection hit the streets of Mykonos for a corresponding digital runway show. This adventurous, pirate-inspired collection featured colorful stripes, dramatic corsets, voluminous sleeves, and billowing skirts. The vintage-inspired nautical designs looked at home on the cobblestone alleyways of the island, while the sea breeze showcased the water-like movement of the silk georgette. This isn't the first trip to Mykonos for the Australian brand. Zimmermann opened a boutique there in May and christened it with an exclusive “Dinner at Sea” on June 16. On Tuesday, The National Gallery of Victoria in Melbourne announced Westwood | Kawakubo, a major new exhibition featuring over 140 designs by fashion icons Vivienne Westwood and Rei Kawakubo of Comme des Garçons. The exhibit, opening with NGV's annual gala on December 6, marks the first time the work of these two designers will be shown together in a dedicated exhibition. The show will highlight key similarities and differences in the work of the two self-taught designers. Nearly 100 pieces have been drawn from the NGV Collection, alongside loans from major international institutions including the Met, Victoria & Albert Museum, Palais Galliera, and the Vivienne Westwood archive. The exhibition also includes over 40 recent Comme des Garçons works gifted to the NGV for this project.

Gucci officially named dancer, singer, and songwriter Lee Know, of the K-pop group Stray Kids, as its newest Global Brand Ambassador on Monday. Regarding his new role, he shared in a press release, “I believe Gucci is a brand that transcends the past and present through heritage and contemporary creativity. It's a great honor to be part of Gucci's visionary journey.” He has long incorporated the brand's designs into his personal style and has attended numerous Gucci events prior to the official partnership announcement, including the Cruise 2025 fashion show in London last year. As a Global Brand Ambassador, Know is set to participate in future events, campaigns, and initiatives for Gucci, joining other notable ambassadors like Robert Pattinson, Kendall Jenner, and Dakota Johnson. Bottega Veneta announced Italian tennis champion Lorenzo Musetti's new ambassadorship this week, following his participation in the house's recent 'Craft is our Language' campaign.

Lorenzo's feature focused on the beauty of the hand motions used in tennis.

643036D9764BDB3BD8714AA12B0943BD,2025-07-04 02:29:59,en,PRINT,"  New Delhi, July 4 -- India's copycat economy is coming under pressure as global brands are starting to fight back. On Tuesday the Delhi High Court revived a long-pending lawsuit by American shoemaker Crocs Inc. against brands such as Bata, Liberty and Relaxo for copying its signature clog shoe design. The case, filed in 2014, had been pending for years before the court revived it this week. While the Crocs suit targets physical retailers, the copycat challenge for global brands has also moved online. Lookalike products that were once confined to local markets or grey channels are easily available on major e-commerce platforms. Some of these copies fall into the category of ""dupes"", which imitate the style of high-end products without logos and often remain in a legal grey zone, but others cross into counterfeiting by replicating trademarks. Digital marketplaces are flooded with lookalikes. A Rs.2-lakh Hermes sandal copy is listed for Rs.599 on one platform while replicas of Tory Burch handbags appear on another. Knockoffs of Marc Jacobs sling bags are available, too. You can also buy a replica of an Rs.18,000 Labubu doll-created by Hong Kong-born artist Kasing Lung-for less than Rs.1,000. Industry executives said this pointed to a growing ""dupe economy"" in India, where platforms host products en masse that mimic global designs, while mostly avoiding legal consequences. French brand Longchamp's signature nylon totes have inspired lookalikes at a leading retail chain and Birkenstock-style cork sandals, priced at Rs.5,000-8,000, are being sold for as little as Rs.1,000 online. Social media is driving much of this demand, with influencers on platforms such as Instagram and YouTube frequently showcasing budget versions of high-end goods, contributing to the sales growth of lookalike products. Abhay Gupta, founder of Delhi-based consultancy Luxury Connect, said, ""The explosion of social media platforms and dominant e-commerce sites has made it nearly impossible to track the spread of luxury fakes and dupes. It's threatening the luxury industry's integrity, discouraging genuine buyers, and diluting brand value. We need stricter intellectual property enforcement and strong action against these platforms. A unified industry voice along with platform accountability is crucial."" Gupta said India is becoming an important luxury market and such practices could dilute its global credibility. ""When mass platforms allow lookalikes of Hermes or Coach to flourish, they send a dangerous message-that originality is optional. If India wants to be taken seriously in the luxury ecosystem, we need sharper policing, better consumer awareness, and greater platform responsibility,"" he said. According to data available online, more than 64% of the world's fake luxury goods are produced in China. In 2021, counterfeit goods accounted for $467 billion in global trade. In India, a 2023 report by ASSOCHAM said 5% of all luxury apparel sold was counterfeit. Amazon said last week that its global Counterfeit Crimes Unit has helped secure over $180 million in court-ordered penalties and prosecuted more than 65 individuals worldwide since 2020, including in India. ""That said, people buying fakes were probably never the customers of the original,"" said Neelesh Hundekari, partner at global consultancy Kearney, who specialises in retail and luxury. ""But if they buy [fakes] out of aspiration, they may become future [genuine] buyers. Most genuine buyers are generally aware of where they can buy originals, but if there aren't enough genuine channels available then these buyers may also end up being cheated."" In mid-June Mint was able to find fakes of several luxury and high-end brands such as Saint Laurent and Tory Burch handbags on Amazon India in mid June. These were priced around Rs.7,000-well below the price of the original products. We sent several queries about this to Amazon on 18 June, to which it said it operates as a third-party marketplace where sellers list and sell products in accordance with applicable laws and selling policies. A spokesperson said, ""We have a zero tolerance policy for counterfeit products and continuously monitor our marketplace. We act quickly to protect customers and brands, including removing counterfeit listings and blocking accounts. We have several brand protection programs under which we collaborate with brands to protect our customers from bad actors attempting to abuse our marketplace."" Some listings were removed after we sent the queries, but new ones have since surfaced with slightly altered brand names. FirstCry, which was advertising fake Labubu dolls through Instagram ads until late last month, did not respond to Mint's queries.The listings were later taken down. Meesho declined to comment on specific products but said its Project Suraksha initiative has multiple strategies to tackle counterfeits and educate sellers. A spokesperson for Myntra said the platform ensures only authorised brands are listed, and has strict systems in place to check authenticity. However, it added that design decisions rest with the brands themselves. Swati Sharma, partner and head of intellectual property at Cyril Amarchand Mangaldas, said India's laws do provide protection against counterfeit goods and misleading listings, but enforcement remains weak and reactive. ""Products that copy a luxury brand's design or logo qualify as counterfeits,"" she said. . She added that courts have taken a strict view in such cases, holding marketplaces accountable when they have promoted or enabled the sale of such products and granting remedies including injunctions, raids, seizures and damages. Despite these challenges, several global luxury brands have secured legal victories in India in recent months. In 2024 the Delhi High Court barred two businessmen from selling fake Louis Vuitton goods through platforms 'Mr. Shoes' and 'Mr. Retail,' ruling they had misused the brand's name. In June, Huda Beauty obtained an injunction against Vision Enterprises, which had imported 28,368 counterfeit cosmetics intercepted at Kolkata Port. Noida-based intellectual property lawyer Safir Anand of Anand & Anand said influencers who promote lookalike products could also face legal consequences. ""Such practices erode brand value, betray consumer trust, and are not protected under law,"" he said. He added that even if influencers don't claim a product is original, promoting it as a cheaper version can still amount to ""passing off"" and may thus violate IP laws. ""There's been a big rise in takedown notices,"" Anand said. ""Luxury brands are stepping up legal action, with quicker trials and stricter enforcement...."

mov_1B961FE19F4BCC69062CA6E25E5EAA5D,2025-07-04 03:30:40,vi,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[vi]Ngày 3/7, TAND TP.Huế (tỉnh Thừa Thiên - Huế) mở phiên tòa xét xử đối với các bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương (SN 1992); Phạm Thanh Long (SN 1992) cùng vợ là Nguyễn Thu Trinh (SN 1992, cùng ngụ P.Xuân Phú, TP.Huế) về tội Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản. Công lý dẫn cáo trạng của VKSND TP.Huế, đầu năm 2021, Lê Thị Hồng Phương bắt đầu kinh doanh online các mặt hàng cao cấp như thực phẩm chức năng, mỹ phẩm, túi xách, nước hoa, đồng hồ... từ các thương hiệu nổi tiếng như Hermes, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Versace... Để có vốn mở rộng quy mô kinh doanh, từ tháng 3/2021, Phương kêu gọi vợ chồng Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh cùng góp vốn đầu tư. Cả ba lập nhóm chat “KIM MONOLOLY GROUP” trên ứng dụng Viber để giao dịch. Phương tự lập các đơn hàng, ghi rõ ngày đi - ngày về và mức lãi suất cao (từ 10% đến 100%) để kêu gọi vốn từ Long, Trinh và những người thân quen của họ. Mỗi đơn hàng có giá trị từ 10 triệu đồng đến hơn 4 tỷ đồng. Việc góp vốn diễn ra suôn sẻ, lợi nhuận cao khiến nhiều người tiếp tục tham gia. Vợ chồng Long và Trinh còn hạ mức lãi suất cho các nhà đầu tư cấp dưới để hưởng chênh lệch từ mức lãi suất mà Phương cam kết. Tuy nhiên, sau một thời gian, hoạt động kinh doanh thua lỗ, hàng hóa không tiêu thụ được khiến Phương mất khả năng chi trả. Để tiếp tục duy trì dòng tiền và trả lãi cho các đơn cũ, Phương lập các đơn hàng giả với lãi suất cao để lôi kéo nhà đầu tư mới, thực chất là chiếm đoạt tiền. Các bị cáo tại phiên tòa. (Ảnh: Báo Công an TP.HCM) Từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, Phương đã huy động vốn thông qua 1.158 đơn hàng, nhận tổng cộng 505,16 tỷ đồng, đã tất toán 990 đơn hàng với lãi suất hơn 91,39 tỷ đồng. Còn lại 168 đơn hàng chưa tất toán, tương ứng 112,3 tỷ đồng. Sau khi trừ phần lãi đã trả, số tiền Phương chiếm đoạt thực tế là 20,3 tỷ đồng. Số tiền này được Phương sử dụng vào các mục đích cá nhân như thuê nhà, thuê kho bãi, vận chuyển hàng hóa, xoay vòng dòng tiền và tiêu xài. Đến ngày 12/4/2022, Phương chính thức tuyên bố mất khả năng thanh toán. Riêng đối với Phạm Thanh Long và Nguyễn Thu Trinh, quá trình điều tra cho thấy, từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, hai bị cáo này sử dụng tiền cá nhân, tiền của người thân và tiền của các nhà đầu tư để đầu tư cho Phương. Đáng chú ý, ngay trước thời điểm Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ, ngày 12/4/2022, Phương vẫn gửi 12 đơn hàng với lãi suất từ 6% đến 25% để Long và Trinh tiếp tục huy động vốn. Ba người đầu tư là anh Nguyễn Tiến Phương 500 triệu đồng, chị Ngô Thị Diệu Lý 850 triệu đồng và anh Trần Hùng 794 triệu đồng. Cuối năm 2022, Cơ quan CSĐT Công an tỉnh Thừa Thiên Huế (nay là TP Huế) khởi tố bị can, bắt giữ các đối tượng. Theo tin tức trên báo Công an TP.HCM, sau khi nghị án, HĐXX tuyên phạt Lê Thị Hồng Phương 14 năm tù về tội “Lừa đảo chiếm đoạt tài sản”; Phạm Thanh Long 5 năm tù và Nguyễn Thu Trinh 3 năm 6 tháng tù về tội “Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản”.

今日有消息传出，知名奢侈品巨头LVMH集团旗下免税店DFS即将撤出新西兰市场。 奥克兰、皇后镇店均即将谢幕。 01 
顾客：“店员说要关店了” 
有今日到奥克兰和皇后镇DFS店购物的顾客说，他们被告知，离境日期在9月30号之后，将无法购买免税产品。 顾客问为何，店员则说“DFS要关店了”。 DFS奥克兰店是新西兰最早的免税店之一，位于Customs St、有百年历史的地标建筑海关大楼。 图：Legacy Construction 
2018年该店全面翻新后重新开业，引入了更多奢侈品牌和本地高端产品，变成了不少华人游客或名人的“打卡地”。 图：小红书 
对比已经开了将近30年的奥克兰店，DFS皇后镇店是2022年10月开业的新店，选址位于镇中心新近翻修的O'Connells购物中心。 但距离开业不到3年，这家门店也即将迎来关闭的命运。 发现君为此向DFS奥克兰店总经理Gareth Jones求证，但对方表示暂未有进一步信息可以透露。 截至发稿前，DFS方面仍未对关店的消息作出回复。 02 
华人网友：“一个时代的终结” 
说DFS是国际化免税店的先驱一点都不为过。 对于新西兰店的关闭，有奥克兰的华人感叹说“一个时代终结”了。 “以前出国时，'DFS'三个字就是免税店的代名词，就像'可乐'指的就是可口可乐一样。” DFS集团的诞生离不开两位颇具传奇色彩的创始人：Robert Miller和Chuck Feeney。 1960年代，战后的国际航空旅行刚刚兴起，但他们发现机场和边境的免税购物服务在当时基本处于空白的状态——仅有驻外的美军和外交官可以通过免税渠道购买商品，普通游客则不能享受这个优惠。 而且，免税购物在当时仅在少数欧洲机场有试点，亚洲市场完全未有开发，于是两人一拍即合，决定将免税购物这个蓝海市场做大做强。 香港启德机场 
1960年，两人在香港创立了DFS前身Tourists International，后改名为Duty Free Shoppers（DFS）。 1962年，DFS拿下了夏威夷和香港的免税销售独家经营权，在香港启德机场和美国檀香山国际机场开设了两家门店，主要销售香烟、酒类，并创新性地引入了奢侈品销售。 由于价格有竞争力，又免去了关税，DFS当时迅速吸引了大量欧美游客。 DFS冲绳店（2005年开业） 
后来随着亚洲旅客前往海外旅行增加，DFS在1968年开设了首家市中心免税店（香港九龙），随后又在檀香山开店。 20世纪90年代中期，DFS的年度产值高达数亿美元，两人的财富也不断飙升。 1996年，法国LVMH集团收购了DFS的大部分股份，并买下了Chuck Feeney价值16.3亿美元的股份。 而Robert Miller则保留着自己38%的股权，成为DFS的重要小股东。 03 
奢侈品巨头收购 
Chuck Feeney将股份出售给LVMH后，便默默将自己近80亿美元财富全部捐了出去。 他设立了“大西洋慈善基金会”，在全球范围内悄悄建起1000多座大学教学楼、图书馆和医院。 Chuck Feeney 
而且，他要求受赠对象不得透露捐款来源，福布斯杂志曾将他成为“慈善界的James Bond”。 Chuck Feeney 
而私下，他的个人生活却十分简朴，没房没车，并在2020年完成了“清空”自己财产的心愿，关闭了基金会。 2023年，Feeney去世。 Robert Miller 
而Robert Miller则继续在商界浮沉，定居中国香港，2010年时曾出席DFS成立50周年活动。 根据福布斯实时资产数据，他目前净资产为20亿美元。 而DFS本身在被LVMH在收购后，也进入全新发展阶段。 在LVMH资本加持下，DFS加速全球化扩张，在亚洲、欧洲、美洲等多个国家和地区不断扩张。 在中国境内，DFS在2008年开设澳门门店，并于2016年扩大相关业务，开设新濠天地T广场门店。 2023年，DFS在重庆江北机场开设了机场店，并计划在2026年在三亚开设其首家世界级七星级奢华零售和娱乐目的地。 04 
经济下行 
奢侈品不再“无敌”？ 过去十年，奢侈品行业几乎就是财富的代名词，疫情后的“报复性消费”更让整个行业一度狂飙，但到了2023年以后，整个风向开始转变。 以DFS母公司LVMH为例，2022年还在狂赚792亿欧元，2023年虽然收入依然强劲，但销售增速已跌回个位数，颓势渐显。 随后受贸易战，尤其是美国关税政策等影响，2025年第一季度总收入不升反降，核心业务收入低于预期，总营收同比下跌2%。 其实自2023年来，DFS在全球多家门店已经宣布关闭。 2023年，DFS在澳大利亚凯恩斯的门店关闭，结束23年经营。 DFS旗下的欧洲旗舰店，位于意大利威尼斯的T Fondaco dei Tedeschi累计亏损约1亿欧元，于2025年上半年逐步停业。 DFS塞班岛店于今年4月30日关闭，结束50年的运营。 而DFS香港及澳门门店在近两年也屡次传出因游客减少，公司裁员的消息。 直至今日，DFS新西兰两间门店也有传闻要关闭。 不仅是DFS，整个奢侈品行业目前都处于低谷。 Gucci、巴黎世家的母公司、另一个奢侈品巨头开云集团的处境也不容乐观。 Gucci从2023年起出现严重疲软，营收连续下滑，为了挽回局面，开云换掉了CEO、创意总监，并大力重组旗下品牌。 05 
谁还在买奢侈品？ 在全球奢侈品步入收缩期的同时，中国市场依然是行业命脉一样的存在。 据路透社报道，顶级咨询公司Bain & Co.报告显示，中国目前仍贡献了全球奢侈品消费约45%，远超北美（23%）和欧洲（17%）。..."

作为在互联网行业卷了多年的打工人，最近挖到一个「跨行业体验管理」的宝藏硕士 —— 港中文 LEE（体验经济领导力硕士），简直是为 AI 时代量身定做的「破局神器」！ 今天必须给想转型 / 提升的宝子们深扒一波～ 
为什么说体验经济是下一个风口？ 当 AI 把客服、数据分析甚至文案都快「卷」成标准化工具时，人类独有的「情感连接」反而成了稀缺资源！ 现在住酒店，除了睡好觉，谁还在乎你有没有「夜床故事」服务； 
去商场，大家更爱打卡「能发朋友圈的艺术装置」，而不是单纯买买买； 
就连医院都开始优化候诊流程，用「智能导诊屏 + 咖啡区」降低焦虑感～ 
总之，未来不管你做零售、航空还是政府服务，「体验设计」就是差异化的王炸！ LEE 项目到底学什么？ 跨行业 + 技术流绝了！ 港中文这个项目可不是传统酒店 / 旅游管理，而是把「体验管理」玩出了花： 
三大核心支柱课程（学完直接能落地） 
《体验经济中的数字化转型》：用大数据分析用户行为，甚至玩 VR 场景设计（比如给商场设计沉浸式购物动线）； 
《生成式 AI 与管理》：用 ChatGPT 生成个性化服务脚本，用机器学习预测客户偏好（这课在 AI 公司简直是刚需！） ； 
《顶点研究项目》：直接和香港国际机场、太古地产合作，实地解决行业痛点（比如优化机场安检排队体验），写进简历秒变大神！ 跨领域选修课（覆盖 80% 行业） 
想进金融？ 有《商业分析》教你优化银行网点服务； 
想搞文旅？ 《航空体验管理》带你研究迪士尼怎么让游客心甘情愿排队； 
甚至还有《ESG 在行动》，教你设计碳中和酒店（现在企业都在卷 ESG，这课多香不用我说了吧！） 港中文的隐藏优势： 
学术 + 产业双开挂！ 师资天团：有心理学教授研究「怎么用脑电技术分析用户情绪」，有 AI 大佬开发过智能客服系统，还有奢侈品集团高管直接来上课，讲真・实战干货拉满； 
实习资源：和香港迪士尼、太古地产有合作，实习直接进头部企业，毕业想留港的话，这些资源太关键了！ 就业方向： 
不局限行业，但薪资很局限（太高了！） 文旅/酒店：做体验创新总监，给高端酒店设计「私人管家 + AI 行程规划」的服务； 
零售/品牌：在 Gucci 搞「AR 试衣间 + 会员专属体验活动」，年薪轻松 30W+； 
科技公司：去字节 / 腾讯做「用户体验策略师」，用 AI 优化 APP 交互流程； 
政府/NGO：帮政府做「线上办事大厅」的体验升级（现在政务数字化多缺这类人才！） 申请小贴士：这些人闭眼冲！ 适合谁： 
✅ 想从传统行业（制造业 / 金融）转体验经济的打工人； 
✅ 学IT/设计，想把技术和商业结合的同学； 
✅ 想创业做「沉浸式体验项目」的野心家！ 加分项：会点 Excel/Python，懂 Figma 设计软件，或者有过品牌策划、用户研究的实习经历（没有也别慌，文书里突出「对体验经济的理解」就行～） 
对比同类项目：LEE 为啥是「性价比之王」？ 和 PolyU 酒店管理比：LEE 覆盖医疗 / 金融 / 航空，不是只能做酒店； 
和港大商科比：LEE 更垂直「体验管理」，课程里全是具体场景（比如怎么画用户旅程地图）； 
和欧美项目比：学费便宜一半，毕业能留港也能回内地，大湾区市场简直是「体验经济试验田」！ 最后想说，在 AI 把「标准化工作」卷到极致的时代，「创造独特体验」才是人类的终极竞争力。 港中文 LEE 就像给你一把钥匙，既能打开跨行业的大门，又能把 AI 当工具用，真的太适合想在新经济里搞事的宝子了！"

The Rhode founder shared posts to promote the latest summer shade in her Rhode Peptide Lip Tint collection, with the caption ""lemontini ballerini."" Oozing beachside-chic, she opted for a simple black string bikini, paired with statement gold earrings and, of course, one of her brand new lip tints. The pièce de résistance was her affordable cat eye sunglasses from the American label, Giant Vintage - a pair also owned by Kylie Jenner. Retailing at just $28 (approximately £20.50), the affordable accessory added a final touch of effortless glamour. The brand was founded in 2004, ""with the belief that unique, never-before-seen styles can be attainable for everyone,"" it explains on its website. ""Each style has a story and a motivation to stand out among the rest. These vintage collectables inspire you to become who you want to be the moment you put them on."" Alongside her renowned beauty brand, which was recently acquired by industry giants Elf, Hailey is recognised for her own personal beauty agenda - notably her glossy skin and iconic manicures. In true Hailey style, she put another mani on the map for summer 2025 with her post, matching her nails to her lemontini lip gloss. You may also like H!

Wielsscca Tiered Maxiskirt Sojos Trendy Square Aviator Sunglasses Ahead of the much-anticipated Nordstrom Anniversary Sale, which lands on July 8, the retailer is clearing out its virtual racks.

The manga started in 1987, it's divided in 9 parts, it's still ongoing during these days and it's the 9th longest manga ever (as well as being the second best rated manga on My Anime List). It has influenced (and has influences from) any kind of pop culture, like real songs and bands, movies, fashion world, real events, ecc... Araki (the mangaka) has done many collaboration with famous brand like Gucci, Balenciaga, Vans Mercedes, other fashion brands and his works were exposed at the Louvre due to his amazing art style that is so recognizable and unique. The anime started in 2012 and ended in 2021 and for now it covers 6 of 9 parts, with the 7th part been announced. Basically it's the bizzarre story of the descendants of the Joestar family, which are all called with the nickname JoJo, each one the main character for each part. Every part is unique from the other but ofc they are all connected. Also the power systems and characters influenced so many other mangas and anime, like basically most of the battle shonen that uses some type of power (one piece, naruto, jjk, db, bleach, ecc). Truly recommended!"

But on the way to my coke dealers house, we got stopped by ICE and he was deported. That was actually right in front of the 9/11 memorial, so I decided to take a quick selfie near the pools while a vaped contemplatively and drank a Mountain Dew matcha soy latte.

🔥 不执着超级大企业：选 “成长型潜力股”
电商 / IP 操盘公司：头部主播公司投融资岗、新消费企业（蕉内 / 元气森林等）商分 / 品牌营销岗，业务有趣、成长性高，适合想搞 “新玩法” 的商科人；
跨境出海 / 游戏赛道：sea/opay/KK 集团等，全球化业务 + 高速发展，能接触前沿模式，对综合能力要求高但回报香！ 🌆 不执着超级大城市：国央企 + 地方机遇
动荡环境下，国央企稳定性拉满！ 清北 / 名校 + VIP 背景有优势，但普通商科人也能找地方分支机构、特色产业带岗位（如新能源基地财务 / 投研），压力小、资源稳～
📊 不执着金融前台岗：金融科技 + 中后台
投研 / 投行太卷？ 试试金融科技产品岗（需求分析 / 战略管理）、内控 / 质核、机构客户经理，有金融基础就能冲，对背景要求低，适合想沾金融边又不想卷前台的同学！ 🏭 不执着传统金融行业：实体企业新赛道
别死磕银行 / 券商！ 新能源（风光储 / 整车）、硬科技（AI / 金融科技）、TMT（电商 / 内容社区） 等实体赛道，hc 多、需求广，商科生可投销售 / 行研 / 财务 / 投资分析，和产业深度绑定更吃香～
🌍 海外背景专属：外企细分赛道
快消别只盯宝洁 / 欧莱雅！ sisley/gap/gucci（快消细分）、amazon/ZURU（零售电商）、CRU / 西门子（能源矿业）等外企，虽招聘低调但待遇好、氛围开放，海外背景冲就完事儿！ 🚀 一级 / 二级买方过渡：曲线救国路径
一级买方：先做 FA、战略咨询（cdd 方向）、互联网战投，再跳 VC/PE，积累项目经验；
二级买方：从券商行研（卖方转买方顺理成章）、实业公司内部研究（光伏 / 新能源赛道）切入，再转基金 / 资管～
⚡️ 死磕 PEVC 的最后倔强
紧盯国资 / 人民币机构+新能源 / 硬科技 / 元宇宙赛道，疯狂积累核心知识（行业研究 / 模型搭建）和项目经历，卷出差异化竞争力，才有机会在最卷赛道突围！ 💡 最后想说：职业规划是动态的！ 别执念 “一步到位”，多试错、学技能、攒经验，螺旋上升才是常态～ 商科人别慌，选对赛道 + 持续迭代，照样能赢麻！ #速通CFA #证书暑期专项 #金融求职 #商科学历#求职干货"

mov_BA0B9F37A31B7CE37BD53B4EFB1E251F,2025-07-04 16:43:15,en,WEB,"  Lana Del Rey's headline concert at Wembley Stadium was more than just a performance—it was an immersive journey through her ever-evolving Americana dreamscape. Cinematic and poetic, the show unfolded like a moody Southern novel, where her signature melancholia met sweeping visuals, gospel harmonies, and moments of pure intimacy with her fans. Gareth Cattermole/ for ABA The scale of the production sparked some debate, but what wasn't up for discussion? Lana's voice, which floated effortlessly through the stadium, and her unwavering commitment to the aesthetic universe she's so carefully crafted. For this milestone performance, Lana wore a custom Gucci creation that felt like the wardrobe counterpart to her latest sonic shift. Her pale yellow silk organza dress—layered over printed silk faille and finished with a coordinating Gucci leather belt—was decked out in the iconic Gucci Flora print. Soft, romantic, and steeped in symbolism, it nodded to the nostalgia she's been embracing lately. This look follows the thread she started weaving at Stagecoach, where her boho phase took a backseat in favour of something deeper, and distinctly Southern. Think: Gone With the Wind meets a ghost story on the bayou. Often described as “dark country” or “Gothic Americana,” this new style blends femininity with folklore, and Lana is leaning all the way in. Gareth Cattermole/ for ABA Gold strappy sandals kept things elegant, while her towering bouffant hairstyle added just the right amount of vintage drama—a nod to the past with her sights set firmly on her next artistic chapter.

mov_85B88F3879C3CC38867E972D4AA36CAD,2025-07-04 17:27:37,en,WEB,"  Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride. While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb - without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries, working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand - one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow, or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets it as a gown, be happy. One would be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires, but it has only two global consumer brands. Having a large home market - by volume, not value - our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts - a net $90 bn deficit. It doesn't help that India's GI regulation is the weakest form of 'sui-generis protection mechanism', as Akriti and Pinaki Ghosh wrote in 2024 in 'Challenges in the Utilization of GI Registration for Capitalizing GI Products', in Journal of Intellectual Property Rights. Lack of enforceability dilutes 'transparency, fairness, effectiveness, and accountability - pillars of good governance', they argue. Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous statutory drafting, sloppy marketing and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations to spur the ages- old artisanship and economically uplift kolhapuri makers. None of the large Indian business groups - those even in fashion or retail - have come forward yet to safeguard their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled sarees as part of a sustainability project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration of iconic monuments and archaeological sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship. From sarees to shoes, music to movies, we hardly prize our handlooms or history, artisans or antiquities. We do not appreciate our own, till the world appreciates it. Oddly enough, while we seek outside validation, we also get easily enraged. Satyajit Ray was 'extremely discouraged' by the initial reception of Pather Panchali in India, Kolkata included. International acclaim, starting with Best Human Document Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, turned the tide. It took America-born Sally Holkar to revive Maheshwari weaves, or John Bissell to create a brand for our fabrics in Fabindia. Delhi-based Scot William Dalrymple has taken India's primordial gift for myth and narrative to make scholarship in history accessible. While the renaissance of modern Indian art owes much to Japanese businessman Masanori Fukuoka. Unless we own, defend and develop our own value chains, we shall continue to let our misplaced chauvinism get the better of us. The devil doesn't just wear Prada."

Rebekah married the heir to the standard oil name on October 1st, 1947. Taylor has also worn two items with the word ""Cloud"" in their names recently, a Cloud bag and a Cloud ring. Out of curiosity, I googled Rebekah Harkness Cloud. This came up: ""her first husband, Charles Dickson Walsh Pierce, who was described as a ""Walter Mitty-like character with his head in the clouds."" Walter Mitty, the short story, was also published in 1947. I find it interesting at least because of the rumors that Taylor's script has been submitted and is about Rebekah Harkness."

mov_80DF2D23BA0ED30EB06044749F3D666B,2025-07-04 21:07:06,en,WEB,"  SortU Tiktok echoes a family noise: It is that of many and different bracelets worn in conjunction. The mantra is 'more is more', so the pulse turns into a canvas where materials, volumes and textures stratify. But how to wear more bracelets in the summer of 2025 avoiding the bazaar effect? Like every trend that landed on the platform, this common gesture has also been renamed: Bracelet Stackor pile of bracelets. Far from the idea of ​​a single protagonist accessory, this trend invites you to multiply, superimpose, compose. But the risk of sliding in the kitsch, between excesses and disorder, is around the corner. Mosaic effect: because it likes so much The boom comes from social networks, where the hashtag #bracelets collect millions of views And suggestions. Users show increasingly creative combinations: there are those who choose only shiny metals, those who play with the colorful resin, those who combine childhood jewelry -jewelry pendants. The idea is that of Create a visual story starting from what is worn: a sentimental mosaic made of charm, stones, engravings and contrasting textures. And even the big brands have not been looking at. Van Cleef & Arpelswith his Alhambra bracelets, is among the most cited on the platform, together also to Cartier, Aurélie Bidermann, or more accessible brands such as Dodus or Pandora. Also in Spiggia, Aurélie Bidmann. Back to the future: the 90s and the revival on the catwalks The stratification of the bracelets is not an absolute novelty. Already in 90s It was a symbol of a certain Bohemien aesthetic, made of leather, beads and souvenirs. The fashion shows were brought back: from Miu Miu his bangles stratified on the arm, a Saint Laurent Which offers maxi golden bracelets with architectural shapes. Chanel, Instead, it focuses on silver with architectural design. Today, however, the gesture changes meaning: it is no longer only accumulation, but intention to express itself. From the spring-summer 2025 fashion shows: at the top left Miu Miu, on the right Elie Saab. At the bottom left Saint Laurent, on the right Chanel. Harmony and character: how it really works The border between expression and confusionthere is to be admitted, it is thin. The key to a Bracelet Stack success is in knowing how to balance materials and volumes. Mix metal and fabric, opaque and brilliant, vintage and contemporary, but keeping consistency. Often one is enough Defined color palettesor a symbolic guiding thread, like a marine theme, botanist or abstract, To avoid the market effect.

mov_1B81680A041E0E5587A74250C80C93CD,2025-07-04 23:12:43,en,WEB,"  Their triumph at the 2022 Euros turned England's Lionesses from little-known footballers into national heroines. And if the tournament made them famous, it also transformed their lives off the pitch. From lucrative brand ambassadorships with high-end fashion labels such as Gucci to turns on the red carpet in dresses worthy of a Kardashian, England's female footballers now enjoy more than a touch of glitz and glamour. Once badly paid and barely recognised – who could forget goalie Mary Earps complaining before the last Euros that Nike hadn't even bothered to print replica shirts with her name on them – the nation's female footballers now have a soaring commercial appeal. So as they prepare to face France at 8pm tonight in their first game of this year's Euros – and inspire a new generation of young women with their sporting prowess – Molly Clayton reveals which of our Lionesses enjoys the most luxurious lifestyle. The Gucci model Shoots for Vogue, GQ and Elle Magazine. Modelling for Calvin Klein. Gucci snapping her up as a brand ambassador. Clearly, as well as being an impressive England captain, Leah Williamson, 28, has a catwalk-worthy fashion career too. One of the biggest earners off the pitch after leading the Lionesses to victory at the Euro 2022 final, the blonde beauty has a deal with Nike and has collaborated with global brands such as Aston Martin, Pepsi, Walkers and Mastercard. With 1.1 million Instagram followers, she has new advert partnerships with Weetabix and Cadbury, along with six children's books, titled The Wonder Team. With the deals comes the gloss: her recent lavish Mallorcan holiday to an Ikos resort would have set her back in the region of £1,000 a night. She is rumoured to be dating former model and Miss USA Elle Smith – both have posted about each other on social media. Ella the business brainbox With her ever-present fake eyelashes and love of make-up, Manchester United midfielder Ella Toone, 25, often showcases her beauty routine on her own YouTube channel. And with a canny business acumen to boot, Ella has already shaped an enviable off-pitch career. The first England women's player to trademark her name, she's set up her own brand, ET7, which includes a football academy for young girls. The name is inspired by her childhood hero, Portuguese footballing superstar Cristiano Ronaldo, whose own brand is called CR7. With some estimating her worth at more than £1 million, last month she set up her own creative agency, Amicizia, which aims to connect female athletes to commercial and marketing opportunities with top brands. Her sponsors include make-up company Charlotte Tilbury, orthodontic brand Invisalign and McDonald's, with her yearly earnings estimated as upwards of £200,000, fuelled by her popularity on social media. At one point, she was one of the top five most viewed athletes on TikTok. Ella has 737,000 Instagram followers and her own BBC podcast with best friend and fellow Lioness Alessia Russo, with whom she has appeared on the front cover of fashion and beauty magazine Elle. Ella loves nothing more than a red carpet bash. In a relationship with footballer Joe Bunney of Stalybridge Celtic FC, she regularly treats her fans to glimpses of their lavish holidays abroad and spa days at five-star hotels. Lauren's ooh la la lego Proving that every passion can be profitable, Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp, 24, has topped up her estimated £400,000 salary with a sponsorship deal with Lego. Devoted to creating Lego masterpieces in her downtime, saying it's 'the best way to relax', she's even made the Mona Lisa out of the bricks. Her other sponsors include Nike and Sports Direct. Lauren also has the support of her girlfriend, former Liverpool midfielder Ashley Hodson. Together for two years, the pair recently enjoyed a romantic trip to Paris, where Lauren saw the Mona Lisa in her more traditional setting. Shy superstar with an ex on the team Growing up, Lucy Bronze lived on Lindisfarne – also known as Holy Island – off the windswept coast of Northumberland. Her grandmother was caretaker of Lindisfarne Castle and today the outline of that building is tattooed on Lucy's wrist. Shy into adulthood, she was diagnosed with ADHD and autism in 2021. But neither her isolated upbringing nor her neurodiversity held her back. Rather, she's said she uses the intense focus associated with her conditions to her advantage – and now the 33-year-old is one of the biggest earners in the game. She reportedly took home £200,000 a year while playing at Barcelona before her move to Chelsea in 2024. Big money deals followed her triumph at the last Euros, with Pepsi, EE, Klarna and Visa among her backers. Her former girlfriend is fellow Lioness Keira Walsh. Fashion week regular She earned almost £2 million in 2023 alone, according to Forbes magazine. That same year, Alessia Russo's transfer from Manchester United to Arsenal made her one of the most expensive female footballers on the planet. Her contract is said to be worth more than £500,000 a year and her commercial appeal is just as lucrative. She has deals with Gucci, Adidas, PlayStation, Beats by Dr Dre and last month was gifted an MGS5 EV car, which she proudly showed off on Instagram. A regular at London Fashion Week, Alessia, 26, has appeared on the cover of magazines such as Women's Health. The BAFTA TV Awards in May saw her in a £1,295 Roland Mouret dress, right. Revealing outfits... on pitch too! Hair scraped back and with braces on her teeth, Chloe Kelly scored that late winning goal against Germany at Wembley in 2022, famously taking off her top in celebration. Since then, she has revelled in her success with a glossy makeover...."

I do not allow my movements to be dictated by platforms that: Suffer data breaches Circulate non-CEO duplicate profiles And cannot verify or protect human value The “101 Error Era”: What Happens When Platforms Fail On March 9, 2022, Netflix entered what became known as the “101 error era”—a massive, global outage that denied access to millions. The system failed. Not due to creativity, but due to weak infrastructure, insufficient verification, and disconnection from real human calibration. Had I been in executive leadership, the outcome would've been different. When you build systems grounded in real-world logistics, human presence, and encrypted transparency, you build resilience.

I totally heart it."" —Pudingal1 Get it from Amazon for $4.17. 3. Emotional support plushies here to comfort you when you're feeling a little down. There are so many options to choose from — like some ~berry~ adorable strawberries, cheery chickies, and (my fave) some juicy dumplings! Promising review: ""I got this for a coworker who had been stressed out lately and happens to love chicken tenders/nuggets. She loves it and has kept it in her office.

BuzzFeed Shopping contributor Jonathan Mazzei says, ""My girlfriend got me this book as a gift a few years ago, and it turned out to be even better than I expected! The prompts are super fun, and help you to think outside of the box even during those moments when you feel like you have no ideas. It's great to casually doodle in while passing time since you don't have to think of what to draw, but it also can be really helpful when brainstorming for creative projects. My girlfriend is a visual artist and graphic designer, and she loves using it to play around with ideas and make her think of things she never would have thought of without it. Plus, it's small and super portable! Highly recommend!"" Get it from Amazon for $9.25. 5. A car mirror swinging animal accessory so you can have a lil' pal next to you during that mundane drive to work. It's simple yet adorable and 1,000% guaranteed to perk up your car and your mood! Promising review: ""Saw it one day when I was just browsing. That's usually dangerous, I know. It's actually heavier than I thought it would be, in a good way though. It's not cheaply made. I've gotten a few laughs from people in other vehicles. The only side effect is if you get upset at other drivers, it isn't very intimidating when you're giving the mad stare. LOL. I was pleased with the purchase in all."" —Charles Ramsey Get it from Amazon for $7.99+ (available in 11 animals). 6...."

    “时尚产业”是一个以创意设计为核心，融合文化、科技、艺术等要素，通过整合传统产业资源并注入时尚消费元素，形成的跨行业、跨领域的综合性产业集群  。 其核心特征包括：    
   •       高创意性    ：依赖设计师的艺术表达与市场趋势捕捉能力，如香奈儿的“小黑裙”通过简约设计引导女性着装趋势。 • 符号价值导向    ：产品不仅满足实用需求，更承载文化意义与身份标识，如奢侈品牌通过限量款传递稀缺性与社会地位。 • 产业融合性    ：覆盖从原材料（如丝绸、皮革）到终端消费（如服装、配饰、美妆）的全链条，并延伸至文化旅游、数字艺术等领域。 • 动态演化性    ：随社会价值观与技术革新持续迭代，如“可持续时尚”通过环保材料与循环经济模式重塑产业逻辑。 正因为“时尚产业”是一个动态演进的复合型生态系统，所以其细分领域会随着技术革新与消费升级而持续扩展。 结合当前全球的产业实践与前沿趋势，  可将“时尚产业”划分为六大核心领域及20+子赛道  ：   
   一、核心制造领域

mov_5A4377AC7C70490E03D8426DECF164D7,2025-07-05 05:00:00,en,WEB,"  According to : “Never before have two global icons of Italian , style, skill, ingenuity and success come together to create an 'instant classic'.” Impressive as this latest, of many, variations on the successful Fiat 500 theme is with the 500e Collector's Edition, I can't believe that the little car exceeds, say, Sophia Loren modelling one of 's sensational outfits. Indeed, Fiat has previously collaborated with two other “icons” to knock out a 500 special – the Fiat 500 by Gucci Edition (2011) and the Fiat 500 Riva (2016). There was also a pretty funky Fiat Panda Alessi (2006). There may be other examples. So maybe not “never before”, and “never better” would just be rude. Almost routine, you might add. Maybe one day they'll produce the Fiat 600e . I'll leave it at that. Another reason for researching these past special editions is to assess their investment potential. I regret to say that, thus far, they don't seem to go for much more than their unspecial peers, with the partial exception of the Panda Alessi. Unlike the Mini Inspired by Goodwood or the Aston Martin Cygnet, two more or less handcrafted versions of popular small cars, which have held their value very well, the 500 specials don't really justify the premium, leastways in economic terms. My test car, at £34,035 (nearer to £30,000 if you shop around), is quite the fashion premium, and only really makes sense on aesthetic grounds. The Spec Fiat 500e Giorgio Armani Price: £34,035 Propulsion: Single electric motor, powered by 42kWh battery, FWD Power (hp): 118 Top speed (mph): 93 0-60 (seconds): 9 Economy (mile/kWh): 4.3 Range (miles): circa 160 CO2 emissions: 0 On that challenge, the old boy has done a good job. At 91 this month (Buon compleanno!) , I'm not sure exactly how hands-on he's been, but the car literally bears his signature (on the touchscreen and discrete balding on its flanks), and the “GA” logo adorns the light grey artificial leather seats and the smart 17-inch alloy wheels, which catch the eye. The paint job works surprisingly well. It has a silky, mild sort of gloss to it, ceramic-style. The shade is “greige”, midway between grey and beige, and a lot nicer than that sounds (there's also a teal blue alternative). On a long (140-mile) drive to the excellent Heveningham Concours in Suffolk, where the Armani edition fits in effortlessly, I found the level of all-round comfort perfectly acceptable, and being electric only, it's fairly refined, plus the boot is big enough for an overnight bag. As a town car, it can cope with the occasional adventure. Fiat claims a range of 192 miles on a single charge but, in my experience, this is over-optimistic. Using “Sherpa” mode a lot to save energy, meaning poor acceleration and top speed of 49mph for much of the drive I squeezed about 140 miles out of it, plus 50 miles spare, and that was also on a hot day. In winter, on the motorway… much less. Petrol or hybrid 500s are no longer available, by the way. In fairness, I should add that the 500e is actually made in Italy, rather than Poland as its immediate predecessor was, and is the first between four (loosely speaking) Italian “icons” – Fiat, Armani and, albeit posthumously, Federico Fellini and Nino Rota. Rather than using a conventional electric whining sound for the legally-mandated pedestrian warning, Fiat took the opportunity to make a sonic brand. It's a melodic sample from Fellini's 1971 comedy-drama Amacord – which translates as “fond memory” – composed by Rota. It is broadcast through the front spoiler when you hit 12mph, but if you have the windows down you can hear it. It is delightful and unique. Chimes apart, the reason why the 500 is so popular has a lot to do with its looks, and here they are gently enhanced by the Fiat and Armani designers. In fact, I found it all a bit too subtle: the Armani signature below the rear side window being almost invisible, and no Armani badging on the boot at all. I mean, I'd be spending £30,000 and I'd at least want the world to know all about that. It also has some formidable competition with the arrivals of the new Renault 5 E-Tech, while the BYD Dolphin Surf is just a better product, looks aside. I'll wait for the second-hand ones, and then pounce, like finding an Armani tie in a charity shop."
FA0724F511A32E4DC29B070B1282CCB9,2025-07-05 05:02:17,en,PRINT,"  Last week, Prada catwalked into a storm, stomping on our bruised pride. While conscientious commentators, fashion pundits and culture vultures tore into the fashion house for selling haute 'toe ring sandals' for a bomb — without giving credit to artisans of Maharashtra who have been, for centuries,   working with tan buffalo hide, babul bark and myrobalan, to cut, stitch   and finish each pair of kolhapuri chappals by hand — one could not help but wonder, why this kolhapuri di? Cultural appropriation is an incendiary   topic worldwide. With the power of consumption shifting east, Western   couture is increasingly coming under scrutiny. Designers like Stella McCartney, or lux labels like Carolina Herrera, Gucci, Givenchy, and even influencers like Kim Kardashian to Katy Perry, have been charged with reckless swiping and sampling. But these debates usually get trapped in reductive binaries of high- and lowbrow,   or first and third world, which continue to help international luxury brands thrive on such hierarchy in the first place. If it is uniquely ours, it's misappropriation. For pragmatic reasons, kolhapuri   has given us global recognition. We do need the world to enjoy what we have. The fashion industry in the West is a well-oiled marketing machine. If it is inspired by a saree and reinterprets   it as a gown, be happy. One would   be happier, though, if that success is shared with those being kept in the margins. India may have several global billionaires,   but it has only two global consumer   brands. Having a large home market — by volume, not value — our desire to build world-class brands is muted. What's more, we let the world copy our creations because we fail to safeguard copyrights. Meanwhile, we continue to pay a lot when we use what we take from the world. Since 1990, India has cumulatively paid $100.8 bn, while receiving only $11 bn, in IP receipts   — a net $90 bn deficit. It doesn't help that India's GI regulation   is the weakest form of 'sui-generis   protection mechanism', as Akriti and Pinaki Ghosh wrote in 2024 in 'Challenges in the Utilization of GI Registration for Capitalizing GI Products',   in Journal of Intellectual Property   Rights. Lack of enforceability dilutes 'transparency, fairness, effectiveness,   and accountability — pillars of good governance', they argue. Unlike Chile (wines), Scotland (single   malts), or France (champagne), our sought-after Darjeeling tea, haldi, alphonso mangoes or even basmati have lost much sheen and premium standings, bogged down in ambiguous   statutory drafting, sloppy marketing   and adulteration. Meanwhile, our South Asian neighbours have stolen both noise and nous. Following the fury, at least Prada has said it will work with Indian artisans. Looking at India's homegrown creative   zeitgeist, very few have done even that, without hiding behind the euphemism   of 'inspiration' that is both commonplace   and convenient. The issue is likely to peter out until the next controversy without ensuring that Prada actually invests in collaborations   to spur the ages old   artisanship and economically   uplift kolhapuri   makers. None of the large Indian business groups — those even in fashion or retail — have come forward yet to safeguard   their interests. Dior, on the other hand, has empowered karigars in Mexico and India, giving them due credit, making them part of the whole creative   process, even sharing sale proceeds. So does Loewe through their exhaustive collabs worldwide, and Gucci when it worked with upcycled   sarees as part of a sustainability   project. Fendi or Bulgari engage in cultural patronage in Rome, funding restoration   of iconic monuments and archaeological   sites. Both feed off each other. But the truth is, in India, we rarely preserve   or contemporise our traditional craftsmanship. From sarees to shoes, music to movies, we hardly prize our handlooms or history, artisans or antiquities. We do not appreciate our own, till the world appreciates it. Oddly enough, while we seek outside validation, we also get easily enraged. Satyajit Ray was 'extremely discouraged'   by the initial reception of Pather Panchali in India, Kolkata included. International acclaim, starting with Best Human Document Award at the 1956 Cannes Film Festival, turned the tide. It took America-born Sally Holkar   to revive Maheshwari weaves, or John Bissell to create a brand for our fabrics in Fabindia. Delhi-based Scot William Dalrymple has taken India's primordial gift for myth and narrative to make scholarship   in history accessible. While the renaissance of modern Indian art owes much to Japanese businessman Masanori Fukuoka. Unless we own, defend and develop our own value chains, we shall continue   to let our misplaced chauvinism get the better of us. The devil doesn't just wear Prada. arijit.barman@timesofindia.com"

mov_DD5460C3F6890BB8502192BE529181DA,2025-07-05 06:24:07,fa,WEB,  SPR_COMBO[fa]به گزارش خبرنگار اقتصادی خبرگزاری تسنیم؛ صنعت نساجی ایران، با وجود تمام چالش‌های محیطی و سیاسی، از جمله تحریم‌های بین‌المللی، دارای ظرفیت‌های فراوان و مزیت‌های نسبی منحصر به فردی است که کمتر به آن توجه شده است. این ظرفیت‌ها که از منابع طبیعی، نیروی انسانی خلاق و بازار مصرف داخلی نشأت می‌گیرد، همراه با توانمندی‌های فناورانه و ابتکارات نوآورانه، زمینه‌ساز رشد و توسعه پایدار در این صنعت می‌باشد. نگاه به بیرون و انتظار رفع تحریم‌ها یا مذاکرات بین‌المللی هرگز نباید نقطه اتکا و راه‌حل اصلی توسعه صنعت نساجی ایران باشد. بلکه باید با اتکا به دارایی‌های خود و استفاده هوشمندانه از فرصت‌های بومی و جهانی، مسیری مستقل و مقتدرانه برای پیشرفت این صنعت طراحی کنیم.  در این مقاله با مرور 40 ظرفیت کلیدی ایران و 27 ابتکار عمل در صنعت نساجی در سطح جهانی، چارچوبی عملیاتی و مبتنی بر واقعیت‌های کشور ارائه شده که می‌تواند ایران را از بند محدودیت‌ها رها ساخته و به جایگاه واقعی خود در بازارهای جهانی برساند. در همین زمینه بیشتر بخوانید الف) 28 تجربه جهانی در صنعت پوشاک و نساجی 1. انگلستان – آغاز صنعتی‌سازی با صنعت نساجی در انقلاب صنعتی قرن 18 انگلستان نخستین کشوری بود که در اواخر قرن 18 با بهره‌گیری از ماشین بخار و سازماندهی کارخانه‌ای، صنعت نساجی را به نقطه آغاز انقلاب صنعتی تبدیل کرد. توسعه ماشین‌های بافندگی، پیدایش کارخانه‌های متمرکز در منچستر و لیدز، و بهره‌برداری از استعمار هند به‌عنوان منبع پنبه خام، این کشور را در قرن 19 به قطب بی‌بدیل تولید پارچه بدل کرد. دولت بریتانیا با حفاظت از نوآوری‌های تکنولوژیک (مانند ماشین اسپینینگ جنی) و ممنوعیت صادرات ابزار تولید تا مدت‌ها از سلطه خود دفاع کرد. تجربه بریتانیا نشان می‌دهد که نساجی می‌تواند پیشران توسعه صنعتی و آغازگر زنجیره‌های بزرگ اشتغال باشد. 2. هند – احیای صنعت نساجی در قرن بیست و یکم با تمرکز بر پنبه و صادرات هند در سال‌های اخیر با صادرات بیش از 40 میلیارد دلار پوشاک و پارچه، به یکی از غول‌های جهانی در صنعت نساجی تبدیل شده است. این کشور با بهره‌گیری از پنبه داخلی، نیروی کار ارزان، و سیاست‌های حمایتی از زنجیره تولید، به‌ویژه در ایالت‌هایی مانند تامیل‌نادو، گجرات و ماهاراشترا، توانسته است مزیت مقیاس را تثبیت کند. نهادهایی مانند وزارت نساجی هند با ارائه یارانه صادرات، تسهیل‌گری در تأسیس پارک‌های صنعتی و ایجاد زنجیره‌های خوشه‌ای، این صنعت را به یکی از پایه‌های توسعه منطقه‌ای تبدیل کرده‌اند. هند همچنین با توسعه برندهای داخلی مانند FabIndia، در پی ارتقاء ارزش افزوده و طراحی بومی است. 3. ترکیه – توسعه صنعت پوشاک با تمرکز بر صادرات و برندهای بومی ترکیه در دو دهه گذشته با تمرکز بر صادرات به اروپا، برندهای موفقی مانند LC Waikiki، Koton و Mavi را در بازارهای بین‌المللی تثبیت کرده است. سیاست‌های ترکیه در دهه 1990 شامل آزادسازی کنترل دولتی، خصوصی‌سازی صنایع نساجی و تأسیس مناطق آزاد بود. استان‌هایی مانند دنیزلی، بورسا، و قاضی‌انتپ به مراکز تخصصی تولید پارچه و پوشاک بدل شدند. ترکیه همچنین زنجیره کامل از نخ‌ریسی تا طراحی مد و بازاریابی بین‌المللی را توسعه داد. تجربیات این کشور نشان می‌دهد که پیوند میان صنعت، صادرات، طراحی و برندینگ می‌تواند صنعت پوشاک را از خام‌فروشی به قدرت‌آفرینی اقتصادی برساند. 4. بنگلادش – ظهور به‌عنوان دومین صادرکننده پوشاک جهان با نیروی کار ارزان و سیاست تشویقی بنگلادش با صادرات بیش از 38 میلیارد دلار پوشاک در سال 2022، پس از چین دومین صادرکننده پوشاک دنیاست. نقطه قوت این کشور، نیروی کار بسیار ارزان و نظام مالیاتی و تجاری خاص مناطق ویژه صادراتی است. سیاست‌هایی چون معافیت مالیاتی، عدم وجود تعرفه بر واردات مواد اولیه، و حمایت از تأسیس کارخانه‌های کوچک و متوسط، باعث شده بیش از 4000 کارخانه پوشاک در بنگلادش فعال باشند. دولت بنگلادش با حمایت از آموزش زنان در مناطق روستایی و ایجاد زنجیره‌های خانوادگی تولید، از صنعت پوشاک به‌عنوان اهرمی برای توسعه فراگیر استفاده کرده است. 5. چین – ساخت زنجیره‌ کامل نساجی از پنبه‌کاری تا برندینگ جهانی چین از دهه 1980 با سیاست درهای باز، صنعت نساجی را به یکی از پیشران‌های صنعتی خود بدل ساخت. زنجیره تولید در چین، از کشت پنبه در ایالت‌های غربی، تا تولید ماشین‌آلات نساجی، دوخت، طراحی و فروش بین‌المللی گسترده است. مناطق ویژه اقتصادی مانند شنژن و شانگهای میزبان برندهای جهانی و کارخانه‌های بزرگ پوشاک شدند. علاوه بر تولید انبوه، چین با شرکت‌هایی مانند Bosideng یا Peacebird وارد حوزه طراحی و برندینگ جهانی نیز شد. دولت چین همچنین با انعقاد توافق‌های تجارت آزاد در جنوب شرق آسیا، صادرات نساجی را تسهیل کرده است. 6. ایتالیا – تقویت برندهای لوکس با تمرکز بر طراحی، کیفیت و مد پایدار ایتالیا به‌واسطه برندهایی چون Gucci، Prada، Armani و Dolce & Gabbana نماد طراحی فاخر در صنعت پوشاک است. این کشور زنجیره‌ای از کارگاه‌های خانوادگی، طراحان مستقل، دانشگاه‌های مد، و شرکت‌های بافندگی باکیفیت را در شمال ایتالیا – به‌ویژه در منطقه لمباردی – توسعه داده است. دولت با حمایت از صادرات برندهای لوکس، شرکت در نمایشگاه‌های جهانی، و استفاده از ابزار دیپلماسی فرهنگی، صنعت مد را به یک قدرت نرم بدل کرده است. تجربه ایتالیا نشان می‌دهد که تمرکز بر ارزش افزوده، طراحی و تولید محدود، برخلاف تولید انبوه، می‌تواند منجر به موقعیت ممتاز در بازار جهانی شود. 7. ویتنام – استفاده از توافقات تجارت آزاد برای توسعه صنعت پوشاک صادراتی ویتنام با بهره‌گیری از توافقنامه‌های تجارت آزاد با اتحادیه اروپا (EVFTA)، کره‌جنوبی، ژاپن و کشورهای ASEAN، تعرفه‌های صادراتی را کاهش داده و سرمایه‌گذاران خارجی را جذب کرده است. شهرهایی مانند هوشی‌مین و هانوی به مراکز تولید پوشاک برای برندهای بین‌المللی مانند H&M و Zara تبدیل شده‌اند. دولت با تأسیس پارک‌های صنعتی، حمایت از آموزش فنی در مدارس و معافیت مالیاتی برای سرمایه‌گذاری خارجی، رشد سریعی را در صنعت پوشاک رقم زده است....

Louis Vuitton、Chanel、Dior、Cartier、Hermès、YSL、Givenchy……
有没有发现，它们几乎都来自——法国‼️
这些品牌，构成了魅力法兰西🇫🇷的标志。 👑 一切从“太阳王”路易十四开始…
法国的奢侈品文化并非偶然，而是从王权时代就被“刻进DNA”。 17世纪，路易十四一边打造凡尔赛宫🌟，一边成立了皇家制造厂，让镜子这种奢侈品开始国产化。 奢侈品从王公贵族的宫廷生活延伸至工艺品、香水、家具🪑与时装👗，奠定了法国“时尚与奢华”的国家品牌。 为什么法国能称霸奢侈品界？ 🧐
这不是偶然，是一场“国家级的精心策划”：
1⃣ 历史文化传承：早在路易十四时代，奢华就已渗透进法国文化
2⃣ 政府全力扶持：法国政府长期为奢侈时尚行业提供资金、打击假货、保护品牌
3⃣ 手工艺精神：传承工坊文化，注重细节与品质
4⃣本地化营销：如在中国市场，会推出中式节日限定款
5⃣ 营造稀缺性：通过限量发售、候补名单营造“买不到”的高端感
6⃣银幕上的加持与文化影响：从赫本到梦露，明星效应强化法国品牌影响力✨
7⃣高端生活方式打造：不只是衣服包包，更是一种“精致的生活方式”
🫅强大的奢侈品集团
就像美国有科技四巨头 GAFA（Google、Amazon、Facebook、Apple）
法国也有自己的奢侈品四巨头——KHOL：
▪️Kering开云集团：旗下有Gucci、YSL、Balenciaga、BV等。 ▪️Hermès爱马仕：独立但实力强劲，球最难买的品牌之一，以手工工艺闻名。 ▪️L'Oréal欧莱雅：美妆界的王者，旗下包含Lancôme、YSL Beauty、Kiehl's等
▪️LVMH路威酩轩：涵盖Louis Vuitton、Dior、Celine、Fendi等80+品品牌。 这些集团凭借并购➕品牌矩阵➕高端战略，牢牢掌控全球市场话语权。 法国奢侈品，是艺术、工艺、身份与文化的集合。 不是一只包，而是一个故事📖
不是一瓶香水，而是一段传承💫
所以当你买下那件“Made in France”的奢侈品时，

As an American who has traveled and lived overseas extensively, I will be the first to tell you that the US was never that ""Shining City on the Hill"" that Reagan and his ilk furiously fapped off to in the 80s. If you look closer at the gate for that ""shining city"", you'll notice a sign. It says, ""Whites Only"". Trump is just Reagan concentrated down to its disgusting and slimy essence. Americans will still slurp it up to make themselves feel better and distract themselves from the fact that the US really is a ""Third-world country wearing a Gucci belt"".

Huế mở phiên sơ thẩm, xét xử ba bị cáo Lê Thị Hồng Phương (SN 1992), Phạm Thanh Long (SN 1992) và Nguyễn Thu Trinh (SN 1992, cùng trú phường Xuân Phú, TP. Huế) về các tội “Lừa đảo chiếm đoạt tài sản” và “Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản”. Hội đồng xét xử tuyên phạt Lê Thị Hồng Phương 14 năm tù về tội “Lừa đảo chiếm đoạt tài sản”. Phạm Thanh Long bị tuyên phạt 5 năm tù, còn Nguyễn Thu Trinh lĩnh mức án 3 năm 6 tháng tù cùng về tội “Lạm dụng tín nhiệm chiếm đoạt tài sản”. Hình ảnh các bị cáo tại tòa. Ảnh: Công lý Theo cáo trạng, đầu năm 2021, Lê Thị Hồng Phương kinh doanh online các mặt hàng như thực phẩm chức năng, mỹ phẩm, túi xách, nước hoa, đồng hồ... mang thương hiệu nổi tiếng như Hermes, Gucci, Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Versace. Để có vốn mở rộng hoạt động, Phương kêu gọi vợ chồng Long và Trinh góp vốn đầu tư. Nhóm này lập nhóm chat “Kim Monology Group” trên ứng dụng Viber để thực hiện giao dịch. Phương chủ động soạn các đơn hàng, ghi rõ thời gian hoàn vốn và mức lãi suất từ 10% đến 100% để thu hút góp vốn từ Long, Trinh và những người quen của họ. Mỗi đơn hàng có giá trị từ 10 triệu đồng đến hơn 4 tỷ đồng. Quá trình đầu tư ban đầu suôn sẻ, lợi nhuận cao khiến nhiều người tiếp tục rót vốn. Vợ chồng Long – Trinh cũng hưởng lợi từ việc hạ mức lãi suất cho nhà đầu tư cấp dưới, ăn chênh lệch từ phần lãi Phương đưa ra. Tuy nhiên, khi hoạt động kinh doanh bắt đầu thua lỗ, không tiêu thụ được hàng hóa, Phương mất khả năng thanh toán. Để tiếp tục duy trì dòng tiền, Phương lập các đơn hàng giả với mức lãi cao nhằm lôi kéo người mới góp vốn, thực chất là chiếm đoạt tài sản. Từ tháng 3/2021 đến tháng 4/2022, Phương đã huy động vốn qua 1.158 đơn hàng, thu về tổng cộng 505,16 tỷ đồng, đã tất toán 990 đơn với lãi suất hơn 91,39 tỷ đồng. Còn lại 168 đơn chưa tất toán, tương đương 112,3 tỷ đồng. Sau khi trừ lãi đã trả, số tiền chiếm đoạt thực tế là 20,3 tỷ đồng, được Phương sử dụng vào các mục đích cá nhân như thuê nhà, kho bãi, vận chuyển hàng hóa, xoay vòng vốn và tiêu xài. Ngày 12/4/2022, Phương chính thức tuyên bố mất khả năng thanh toán. Cùng thời gian này, vợ chồng Long và Trinh sử dụng tiền cá nhân, tiền người thân và nhà đầu tư để góp vốn cho Phương. Đáng chú ý, ngay trong ngày 12/4/2022 – thời điểm Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ, Phương vẫn gửi 12 đơn hàng với lãi suất từ 6% đến 25% cho Long và Trinh nhằm tiếp tục huy động vốn. Ba nhà đầu tư gồm anh Nguyễn Tiến Phương góp 500 triệu đồng, chị Ngô Thị Diệu Lý góp 850 triệu đồng và anh Trần Hùng góp 794 triệu đồng. Vài giờ sau, Phương tuyên bố vỡ nợ. Vợ chồng Long – Trinh chỉ hoàn trả cho anh Trần Hùng, không thông báo gì đến chị Lý và anh Phương, cũng không hoàn lại số tiền 1,35 tỷ đồng đã chiếm đoạt để sử dụng vào mục đích cá nhân. Hội đồng xét xử tuyên phạt Lê Thị Hồng Phương 14 năm tù, Phạm Thanh Long bị tuyên phạt 5 năm tù, còn Nguyễn Thu Trinh lĩnh mức án 3 năm 6 tháng tù.

Huế) với giá 4,3 tỷ đồng để trả nợ cho người thân, song vẫn không hoàn trả khoản tiền 1,35 tỷ đồng cho chị Lý và anh Phương. Tại phiên tòa, các bị cáo thừa nhận toàn bộ hành vi phạm tội, thành khẩn khai báo, thể hiện sự ăn năn hối cải và xin được hưởng mức án nhẹ.

Sans rancune, Demna y dévoile même un mail de 2007 dans lequel Balenciaga déclinait sa candidature. - Success story et accrocs - Presque vingt ans plus tard, le Géorgien de 44 ans a fait de la griffe une marque désirable, ayant franchi le milliard d'euros de chiffre d'affaires. Clés de ce succès, son style iconoclaste, des T-shirts à de la haute couture, sa capacité à rendre désirable le ""moche"", des Crocs à semelles compensées aux sacs poubelle, ainsi que ses connexions people, de la rappeuse américaine Cardi B à l'actrice française Isabelle Huppert. Mais cela ne s'est pas fait sans accroc. Retour en 2022. En octobre, Balenciaga doit couper les ponts avec le rappeur Kanye West, ami de Demna qui a ouvert son défilé trois semaines plus tôt à Paris, après ses dérapages antisémites. En novembre, le styliste, cité parmi les 100 personnalités les plus influentes au monde par le magazine américain Time, se retrouve lui-même dans l'oeil du cyclone après une campagne publicitaire mettant en scène des enfants avec des accessoires d'inspiration sado-masochiste. Demna reconnait un ""mauvais choix artistique"" et promet de changer son ""approche provocatrice"" dans la façon de concevoir et de montrer ses vêtements. ""On a droit à l'erreur dans un groupe comme Kering. On n'a pas le droit de faire deux fois la même"", le prévient François-Henri Pinault. Défilés sur une table de cuisine XXL inspirée de celle sa grand-mère ou dans un étroit couloir à l'intérieur d'un cube noir, plutôt que dans la boue, mais collections toujours très streetwear, le créateur a depuis mis de l'eau dans son vin, tout en conservant ses signes distinctifs. Suffisant pour relancer Gucci, en perte de vitesse ? L'action Kering a dégringolé après l'annonce de sa nomination, les investisseurs attendant plutôt un poids lourd venu de l'extérieur, selon des analystes. - ""Traumatismes"" - Demna Gvasalia, qui a abandonné son nom de famille pour ses représentations dans la mode, est né le 25 mars 1981 à Soukhoumi, en Abkhazie, région de la Géorgie alors république soviétique. Dans les années 1990, après la chute de l'URSS, il a fui, avec sa famille, le ""nettoyage ethnique"" des Géorgiens par les séparatistes abkhazes prorusses. ""La guerre en Ukraine a réveillé la douleur et les traumatismes que j'avais en moi"", a-t-il confié en dédiant, en mars 2022, un show au pays récemment envahi par la Russie, lors duquel ont défilé sous une tempête de neige des ""réfugiés"" à moitié dénudés et portant des sacs poubelle, vendus ensuite plus de 1.500 euros. Diplômé de l'Académie Royale des Beaux-Arts d'Anvers (Belgique), Demna est passé par Maison Margiela et Vuitton, avant de créer avec son frère en 2014 la marque Vetements, abandonnée en 2019, puis d'être nommé directeur artistique de Balenciaga en 2015. Dans une interview en 2021 au magazine Vanity Fair, il confiait que la mode était pour lui ""une bataille"", d'où ""l'agressivité et la noirceur"" de ses créations. publié le 5 juillet à 11h51, AFP Partager"

0A1714757D78F0BAA5AC0542E0DEC852,2025-07-05 10:35:26,en,PRINT,"  THE GUCCI MODEL SHOOTS for Vogue, GQ and Elle Magazine. Modelling for Calvin Klein. Gucci snapping her up as a brand ambassador. Clearly, as well as being an impressive England captain, Leah Williamson, 28, has a catwalk-worthy fashion career too. One of the biggest earners off the pitch after leading the Lionesses to victory at the Euro 2022 final, the blonde beauty has a deal with Nike and has collaborated with global brands such as Aston Martin, Pepsi, Walkers and Mastercard. With 1.1 million Instagram followers, she has new advert partnerships with Weetabix and Cadbury, along with six children's books, titled The Wonder Team. With the deals comes the gloss: her recent lavish Mallorcan holiday to an Ikos resort would have set her back in the region of £1,000 a night. She is rumoured to be dating former model and Miss USA Elle Smith - both have posted about each other on social media. LAUREN'S OOH LA LA LEGO PROVING that every passion can be profitable, Manchester City forward Lauren Hemp, 24, has topped up her estimated £400,000 salary with a sponsorship deal with Lego. Devoted to creating Lego masterpieces in her downtime, saying it's 'the best way to relax', she's even made the Mona Lisa out of the bricks. Her other sponsors include Nike and Sports Direct. Lauren also has the support of her girlfriend, former Liverpool midfielder Ashley Hodson. Together for two years, the pair recently enjoyed a romantic trip to Paris, where Lauren saw the Mona Lisa in her more traditional setting. SHY SUPERSTAR WITH AN EX ON THE TEAM GROWING up, Lucy Bronze lived on Lindisfarne - also known as Holy Island - off the windswept coast of Northumberland. Her grandmother was caretaker of Lindisfarne Castle and today the outline of that building is tattooed on Lucy's wrist. Shy into adulthood, she was diagnosed with ADHD and autism in 2021. But neither her isolated upbringing nor her neurodiversity held her back. Rather, she's said she uses the intense focus associated with her conditions to her advantage - and now the 33-year-old is one of the biggest earners in the game. She reportedly took home £200,000 a year while playing at Barcelona before her move to Chelsea in 2024. Big money deals followed her triumph at the last Euros, with Pepsi, EE, Klarna and Visa among her backers. Her former girlfriend is fellow Lioness Keira Walsh. FASHION WEEK REGULAR SHE earned almost £2million in 2023 alone, according to Forbes magazine. That same year, Alessia Russo's transfer from Manchester United to Arsenal made her one of the most expensive female footballers on the planet. Her contract is said to be worth more than £500,000 a year and her commercial appeal is just as lucrative. She has deals with Gucci, Adidas, PlayStation, Beats by Dr Dre and last month was gifted an MGS5 EV car, which she proudly showed off on Instagram. A regular at London Fashion Week, Alessia, 26, has appeared on the cover of magazines such as Women's Health. The BAFTA TV Awards in May saw her in a £1,295 Roland Mouret dress, right. BURBERRY CLAD GOALIE BURBERRY HANNAH Hampton - the longhaired goalkeeper with the girl-next-door looks - certainly has big shoes to fill after Mary Earps surprisingly announced her retirement from the squad last month. The 24-year-old Chelsea player has posed in Burberry for Elle magazine and counts Nike and Extra chewing gum among her corporate sponsors. She also works with Birmingham Children's Hospital after enduring numerous eye operations as a child to cure a squint. Hannah was told she would never be a professional sports player. ' I've gone through life proving people wrong,' she said recently, words that inspired devotion among her 228,000 Instagram followers. Her relationship status isn't known. DUBAI DEVOTEE SHE never travels without her Louis Vuitton luggage, can often be seen posing in a Maybach car, and enjoys swanky trips to Dubai, staying at the luxury Five resort there. Chelsea star Lauren James, 23, has treated herself to some of the finer things in life since her key role in the Lionesses' 2023 World Cup campaign. While her relationship status isn't known, she's close to her older brother Reece, who plays for the Chelsea men's team. She has commercial deals with Nike, Google Pixel, Optimum Nutrition, Sure deodorant and Walkers. The superstar siblings often attend red carpet events together. But while she is reportedly on £350,000 a year at Chelsea, Reece earns £250,000 a week. KOOKY STYLE SO DEVOTED is she to tattoos that midfielder Georgia Stanway, 26, not only has around 100 of her own inkings, but she's also learned to tattoo other people. The Bayern Munich star's kooky style has won her sponsors including Nike and an advertising deal with Celsius drinks, who featured on her Instagram page, where she has 433,000 followers. Off the pitch, she's been with Toulouse rugby league player Olly Ashall-Bott since 2022...."

Felicity Skinner Courtesy of Bazaar US Pacar pertama Harry saat usianya 15 tahun, Felicity, angkat bicara tentang dirinya setelah Harry menjadi terkenal. ""Ia sangat manis. Ia pacar yang sangat baik, sangat romantis, dan, ya, pemalu,"" ujarnya tentang hubungan mereka yang berlangsung kurang dari satu tahun. 2. Caroline Flack Courtesy of Bazaar US Di awal kariernya, Harry sempat menjalin hubungan singkat dengan mendiang pembawa acara X-Factor, Caroline Flack. Namun, setelah para penggemar One Direction mengetahui hubungan tersebut, Caroline menerima banyak surat kebencian dan ejekan terkait perbedaan usia, hingga ia mengatakan: ""Tak satu pun dari kami menyangka situasinya akan berubah menjadi begitu kejam dan benar-benar jahat."" Tak lama kemudian, keduanya memutuskan untuk tetap berteman. 3. Lucy Horobin  Courtesy of Bazaar US Menimbulkan sedikit skandal, Harry kemudian dikaitkan dengan DJ Lucy Horobin yang saat itu sudah menikah, pada tahun 2011. Setelah diberitakan bahwa keduanya sempat menghabiskan malam bersama, media sosial Twitter pun heboh, dan Lucy akhirnya bercerai dari suaminya. 4. Emma Ostilly  Courtesy of Bazaar US Setelah foto-foto Harry mencium seorang gadis pirang misterius di dalam mobil Range Rover-nya beredar di internet, para penggemar One Direction kembali heboh. Hubungan tersebut pun segera meredup secepat saat pertama kali mencuat ke publik. 5. Emily Atack Courtesy of Bazaar US Ketika keduanya terlihat bersama di depan umum, rumor tentang hubungan antara personel One Direction dan aktris The Inbetweeners mulai ramai di media. Meskipun kabar tersebut tak pernah dikonfirmasi oleh kedua belah pihak, Emily kemudian mengungkapkan bahwa mereka memang sempat ""bersenang-senang sedikit."" 6. Caggie Dunlop Courtesy of Bazaar US Ketika Caggie tertangkap kamera bersama Harry di dalam mobil Range Rover-nya, rumor hubungan pun mulai beredar. Namun, apa pun yang terjadi di antara mereka dengan cepat meredup, kabarnya karena amukan para penggemar One Direction, seperti yang bisa ditebak. 7. Cara Delevingne Courtesy of Bazaar US Setelah terlihat bersama di berbagai kesempatan pada tahun 2012, rumor hubungan antara Harry dan Cara mulai beredar. Ia bahkan sempat terlihat duduk di barisan depan saat Cara tampil di panggung peragaan busana. Apa yang lebih menarik dari hubungan antara personel band dan supermodel? Meski keduanya tak pernah mengonfirmasi hubungan secara resmi, Cara sempat berkomentar, “Saya lebih suka menjaga kehidupan pribadi saya tetap pribadi, dan itu saja yang bisa saya katakan.” 8. Pixie Geldof Courtesy of Bazaar US Setelah keduanya terlihat meninggalkan sebuah klub bersama pada tahun 2012, rumor tentang hubungan antara Harry dan Pixie pun mencuat...."

n1gudi1,2025-07-05 13:32:35,en,REDDIT,"  I've never seen an actual rich person by flashy designer brands like LV/Gucci. Most people buying that shit are just trying to give the false perception of richness. Rich people by high-quality clothes with no visible branding that'll last a lifetime like Loro Piana or Brunello Cucinelli. Also if you actually like the designs of brands like LV or Gucci, just find a fake from a weidan or yupoo seller and do a haul. You can get near 1:1 reps of this shit for like only 5% of the cost. But even then, what's so bad about Walmart/Amazon/Target clothing? They have plenty of non-branded basic stuff that you can turn into that DHV. Khakis, jeans, t-shirts, you can get them for cheap and mix and match and still have some banger outfits. Also wearing designer unironically gives off a sense of insecurity and approval seeking. I own many fake Off White hoodies and Travis Scott Jordan 1's since I actually like the way they look and don't want to shell out thousands of dollars on them.

Just ChatGPT, Midjourney, and prompts that don't play safe. Here's my secret: Your brain remembers images that hit different—the Vividness Effect. So instead of typing weak prompts like “A photo of a model,” I'm telling GPT: “Ultra-realistic editorial of a stylish Black man in a tan suit, chilling in a wicker chair surrounded by tropical plants, warm burnt orange backdrop, soft studio light, shot on a 50mm lens (and more).” And I don't stop there. I add the motion blur, film scratches, and cinematic glow that makes it feel like Gucci's crew filmed it. It costs me nothing—but brands still pay me because these visuals scale.

This is how quickly I am able to distribute secure, encrypted videos from my physical handwritten augmented reality signature onto paper, products, and verified experiences—all in real time. Who I Am: I am Ms. Elijha Watkins®, the one and only inventor of the handwritten augmented reality autograph. My work is a living legacy—a direct fusion of art, science, and human verification. Every experience I create is authentic, offline, and powered by encrypted human-to-human interaction—not digital illusions or manipulated analytics. I create real experiences for real people, not bots, not fakes, and not data sets. My technology flows directly from the palm of my hand, my products, and my physical signature, verified by geotags, timestamps, and multifactor human encryption. Even in the face of third-party system failures—like the 96 fraudulent profiles linked to a single CEO—I remain vigilant and secure. I have moved beyond traditional data breaches, algorithmic errors, and compromised verification systems. My work is not defined by ethnicity, platform dependency, or algorithmic classification. I move forward with transparency, justice, and unity for all living beings. No matter the color, race, shape, or form—every soul, every creature, and every real human being deserves to be treated with dignity and compensated fairly for their worth and contributions. I distribute: Augmented reality visuals Books with voiceovers and layered audio Encrypted physical autographs Offline NFT-verified merchandise Products with real-time calling features Visual experiences that continue to evolve over time I am one of one. There is no replica, no comparison, and no duplicate. And I will continue to be one of one—creating experiences that elevate humanity, inspire the spirit, and advance our shared future.

mov_C6D426BAC7B020B2BB661C7A7D690C97,2025-07-06 05:22:19,en,WEB,"  Celebrated, controversial and clearly up for a challenge, fashion designer Demna is set to step into one of the most difficult jobs in the luxury clothing industry next week as chief creative at struggling Gucci. The 44-year-old, who fled the war-wracked Georgian region of Abkhazia as a child and dropped his surname ""Gvasalia"" in 2021, will bow out with a last show for Balenciaga on Wednesday before switching to Gucci -- both firms owned by France's luxury giant Kering. ""Demna's contribution to the industry, to Balenciaga, and to the group's success has been tremendous,"" Kering chairman and CEO Francois-Henri Pinault said at the time. ""His creative power is exactly what Gucci needs."" Investors were not so convinced and shares in Kering, which counts on Gucci as its main profit generator, fell around 12 percent on the day of the announcement before slumping even further. Other more established and mainstream designers from Hedi Slimane, Maria Grazia Chiuri or Pierpaolo Piccioli had been linked to the vacancy. Some analysts have questioned whether Demna's recipe for success at Balenciaga -- which leant heavily on provocative, streetwear-influenced design and showmanship -- can be replicated at the more classic Italian house. ""He is iconoclast and ironic, which is good to attract attention toward a small brand like Balenciaga,"" Luca Solca, a luxury analyst at the Bernstein brokerage, wrote afterwards. ""However, we are not sure the strategy would work as well for a bigger brand."" - 'Absolutely uncompromising' - Demna's final show for Balenciaga will take place on Wednesday during Haute Couture fashion week in Paris and he will join the Italian label the very next day. During a decade at the Spanish-born but Paris-based brand, he drove sales and attention sharply higher with a mix of headline-grabbing creations as well as personal publicity -- not always positive. More in Business He achieved notoriety with his $2,000 ""Ikea"" bag, a luxury leather version of the 99-cent original. He followed it up with an $1,800 garbage bag -- the so-called ""trash pouch"" -- in a show in March 2022 that was dedicated to Ukrainian refugees. Other daring designs included a head-to-toe black shroud that US reality television star Kim Kardashian -- a personal friend -- wore to the Met Gala in 2021. A-list celebrity endorsements have been plentiful, but have not always worked out. Kanye West —- Kardashian's ex and another friend -- opened Balenciaga's show in October 2022 shortly before the first of several anti-Semitic outbursts, and the group had to cut ties with the rapper. Demna's lowest point came in February 2023 when he was forced to apologise for an ad campaign that appeared to reference child abuse and had underage models in what looked like bondage gear. He has plenty of fans among Gen Z tastemakers, however. ""I've always gravitated toward Balenciaga, because I love Demna's vision,"" British pop sensation Charli XCX told British Vogue last year. ""He feels like he's speaking his own language, which is absolutely uncompromising, and to me, that's what makes a brilliant artist."" - 'Aggression and darkness' - Annual sales at Balenciaga were estimated to be $350 million when he arrived and had surged to about $2 billion in 2022, according to GQ magazine. Gucci's fortunes have headed in the other direction: they slid 23 percent last year, prompting Kering to fire creative director Sabato de Sarno after only two years in the job. Demna is a graduate of the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in Antwerp in Belgium and went on to work at Maison Margiela and Vuitton. He co-founded the label Vetements with his brother in 2014, a year before he was named to the top job at Balenciaga. For many years, his childhood trauma fleeing pro-Russian separatists in his homeland affected his work, but he told Vanity Fair in 2021 that counselling, meditation and exercise had helped exorcise some demons. ""Fashion used to feel like a battle for me. That is why there was a lot of aggression and darkness in what I did. Today I feel at peace with the system,"" he said. neo-pel-mdv-adp/jxb"

mov_D4D35FEC6B06BDC4FE86CE98A9A44243,2025-07-06 08:06:43,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Una mujer de 38 años y un hombre de 47 fueron detenidos en las últimas semanas en el conurbano bonaerense, acusados de integrar una red criminal que actuaba con la modalidad de “viuda negra”. La banda está vinculada a un caso reciente donde un ingeniero de 46 años fue seducido, drogado y despojado de 23.600 mil dólares en el barrio porteño de Palermo y a otro ataque ocurrido en la localidad bonaerense de San Fernando. En lo que va del año, se registraron al menos dos muertes y la embajada de Estados Unidos emitió una advertencia a turistas por el aumento de casos. La Policía de la Ciudad logró desarticular una célula de una organización delictiva dedicada al robo mediante el uso de sedantes, tras una serie de allanamientos realizados en las localidades bonaerenses de Llavallol, Remedios de Escalada y Lomas de Zamora. Los procedimientos permitieron la detención de dos personas –un hombre de 47 años y una mujer de 38– y el secuestro de dispositivos electrónicos, historias clínicas falsificadas y medicamentos como clonazepam, usado para sedar a las víctimas sin su conocimiento. La investigación se inició en enero de este año, luego de que un ingeniero de 46 años denunciara haber sido drogado y despojado de sus bienes en su departamento de Palermo. A partir del análisis de cámaras de seguridad, registros de aplicaciones de transporte, comunicaciones telefónicas y redes sociales, los investigadores reconstruyeron el circuito delictivo y vincularon a los detenidos con otros casos ocurridos en la Comuna 14. El esquema estaba cuidadosamente planificado: Juliana J., que se hacía llamar “Agustina”, se encargaba de seducir a las víctimas, coordinar encuentros a través de aplicaciones como Tinder y administrar sustancias para reducirlas. Débora J. confeccionaba recetas médicas falsas y organizaba la logística del robo, y Diego M. se encargaba del transporte y la reducción de los bienes sustraídos. Durante los últimos allanamientos, se incautaron diez celulares, dos notebooks, una tablet, un DVR con capacidad de almacenamiento de imágenes y un CPU con archivos clave, entre ellos “comunicaciones entre los integrantes de la banda, registros de transferencias y capturas de conversaciones con potenciales víctimas”, según confirmaron fuentes judiciales. Esto no les gusta a los autoritarios El ejercicio del periodismo profesional y crítico es un pilar fundamental de la democracia. Por eso molesta a quienes creen ser los dueños de la verdad. Hoy más que nunca Suscribite Juliana J., de 20 años, fue detenida en febrero pasado. Es la que supuestamente sedujo al ingeniero y le robó 23.600 dólares, dos notebooks, un iPhone, lentes Gucci y champagne importado. Lo había contactado por Tinder. El encuentro terminó con la víctima inconsciente y el departamento prácticamente vaciado. La acusada fue procesada con prisión preventiva y hasta le trabaron un embargo de 30 millones de pesos. El avance de la investigación permitió establecer que Juliana tenía vínculos con la red ahora desbaratada en el Conurbano, lo que permitió trazar una línea directa entre los distintos operativos. La sospecha es que Agustina trabajaba bajo las órdenes de Débora y que el robo que sufrió el ingeniero no fue el primero ni el último. De hecho, los investigadores pudieron determinar que la organización habría actuado en otro ataque bajo la misma modalidad en la localidad bonaerense de San Fernando. Más violencia, más muertes. En lo que va del año, al menos dos víctimas murieron como consecuencia de este tipo de ataques. El primero de los casos ocurrió en Montserrat, donde un hombre de 38 años fue hallado sin vida en su departamento luego de asistir a una peña folclórica. La noche comenzó en un local ubicado sobre avenida Rivadavia al 2100, donde la víctima y un amigo conocieron a dos mujeres de entre 25 y 30 años. Tras compartir tragos y charlas, decidieron continuar el encuentro en el domicilio de uno de ellos, en Solís al 300. Horas después, el sobreviviente despertó desorientado y notó que el lugar estaba revuelto. Al buscar a su amigo, lo encontró inconsciente en el piso. Llamó de inmediato al 911, pero el SAME constató que el hombre ya había fallecido. Según el informe preliminar, la autopsia reveló edema cerebral, hemorragia y congestión pulmonar, signos compatibles con intoxicación por psicotrópicos. El segundo caso, ocurrido en Lanús Oeste, tuvo como víctima a Jorge Costa, un jubilado de 77 años. En febrero, Costa se encontró con una mujer de nacionalidad uruguaya, Arita Diana C., a quien había conocido previamente y con quien compartió una cena antes de regresar a su vivienda en Villa Diamante. Las cámaras de seguridad muestran a la mujer entrando al edificio cerca de las 22.17 y saliendo sola dos horas después, cargando dos bolsos. La víctima fue hallada al día siguiente por su hijo, inconsciente y con signos de sedación. Fue trasladado al Hospital Evita, donde murió poco después. La fiscalía local ordenó la detención de la sospechosa, quien fue capturada en Quilmes. En su domicilio encontraron pertenencias de la víctima: un celular, un reloj y el televisor robado. Las pericias confirmaron la presencia de sustancias compatibles con ansiolíticos en el cuerpo del jubilado. Estos episodios encendieron las alarmas no solo a nivel judicial sino también diplomático. El 20 de junio, la Embajada de Estados Unidos en Argentina emitió un comunicado inusual, advirtiendo a sus ciudadanos sobre el aumento de delitos cometidos por “viudas negras”. La advertencia fue clara: evitar aceptar bebidas de desconocidos, no reunirse en espacios privados con personas contactadas por redes y notificar al consulado en caso de encuentros sospechosos. La alerta internacional confirmó lo que la Justicia ya advertía: el fenómeno no solo se expande, sino que se profesionaliza, con estructuras que incluyen captación de víctimas, falsificación de documentación, provisión de psicotrópicos y blanqueo de objetos robados. En muchos casos, las víctimas son turistas extranjeros con alto poder adquisitivo. Los investigadores sostienen que el uso de redes sociales y apps de citas facilita el accionar de las bandas. “La naturalización del contacto con desconocidos y el ambiente informal de las citas favorecen el engaño y la administración de sedantes sin resistencia”, explicó un perito interviniente. A su vez, el uso de recetas médicas falsas permite el transporte de medicamentos controlados sin levantar sospechas. Cámaras, Uber y celulares R.P. “Agustina” fue identificada y arrestada en febrero pasado gracias a un extenuante trabajo que incluyó el análisis de las cámaras privadas y del Centro de Monitoreo de la Ciudad, pedidos a UBER para establecer los viajes solicitados en la zona donde ocurrieron los hechos y varias declaraciones testimoniales...."

2283b736d96ed37a9c6502b279fd4568,2025-07-06 10:11:00,en,WEB,"  I'm excited to write about this topic because it's not only fascinating but also enlightening and empowering. As a wealth enthusiast who didn't come from money, I genuinely want to understand how wealthy people think and operate. If you want to build generational wealth, you can't just focus on making money; you have to learn how to think like money. And the best teachers aren't the newly rich people flexing on social media or the entrepreneurs bragging about their latest deals. The best teachers are women with the mindset that preserves wealth across generations. They understand the unspoken rules, quiet codes, and subtle behaviors that separate old money from new money. And if you're interested in building wealth from scratch like I am, studying how they move through the world is like getting a masterclass in financial psychology. Here's what you'll never see truly wealthy women do in public: 8 Things Truly Wealthy Women Never Do in Public 1. They Never Talk About Money or How Much Things Cost One of the best books I've read on finance, and one I still plan to read again, is “ The Rules of Wealth ” by Richard Templar. The 4th rule of wealth he mentioned is keeping things under your hat. See the pictures below to view my highlights: Let me tell you, wealthy women have turned this into an art form. They don't discuss money in public because they don't need to. You'll never hear them bragging about how much they spent on something or complaining about how expensive things are. They don't name-drop prices or make their financial decisions everyone else's business. When someone compliments their handbag, they say “thank you,” not “Thanks, it was three thousand dollars.” I did something similar once, and I was instantly ashamed of myself. Lol. Because talking about money, whether you're bragging about having it or complaining about not having enough, makes everyone at the table do mental math about their own finances. And nobody wants to be the person who makes the entire room uncomfortable by mentioning that their handbag costs more than someone's monthly rent. Rich women also understand that money conversations are never actually about money. They're about power, status, and making other people feel a certain way. When you announce prices, you're either trying to impress people, or you're unconsciously making them feel bad about their choices. Neither is a good look. Also, there's something almost sacred about money in certain circles. The same way you wouldn't discuss your medical procedures over appetizers, wealthy women treat financial details as private information that doesn't belong in casual conversation. They've learned that the moment you start talking numbers, you stop being seen as a person and start being seen as a bank account. Wealthy women would rather be known for their character, their intelligence, or their contributions than for their ability to spend money. The people who need to know about your wealth already do. And the people who don't need to know don't need to be told. 2. They Never Wear Everything Expensive at Once Yes, you have the money and can afford to buy the nicest things, but drowning yourself in logos isn't the flex you think it is. Some women walk into events looking like a designer store has exploded on them; a Gucci bag, Chanel shoes, Hermès scarf, Cartier watch, and a Louis Vuitton belt, all at the same time. And every wealthy woman in the room immediately knows they're trying too hard because it's giving “I just got money, and I need everyone to know it” energy. Actual rich women dress as if they had forgotten they were rich. They'll wear a $3,000 sweater that looks like it came from nowhere special, paired with jeans that fit perfectly and shoes that are comfortable enough to wear all day. The only people who recognize the quality are other people who can afford the same things. It's like speaking in code: if you know, you know. If you're wearing every expensive thing you own at once, you're basically screaming, “I'M RICH,” in a room full of people who prefer to whisper about their wealth. Wealthy women don't scream; they whisper. They save the dramatic displays for people who need to be impressed by logos, which definitely isn't other wealthy people. 3. They Never Take Photos of Their Food, Expensive Purchases, or Hotel Rooms For Validation Okay, this is quite controversial because we are in the creator economy, and everyone wants to share their world and experience with the world for various reasons. It's easier to build a personal brand when you have pretty pictures of yourself wearing nice things and being in fancy places to share. Content creation is a legitimate business, and lifestyle content sells. Aside from that, it's just fun to create and share. For instance, I enjoy watching Temi Otedola , the youngest daughter of Femi Otedola , one of the richest men in Africa...."

mov_AC2B6B80489CF7474A8A3C88B553FE35,2025-07-06 10:27:08,en,WEB,"  Reality star Kim Kardashian has shared an emotional tribute to her childhood friend Lindsay May, who died from cancer in February. The 44-year-old, who grew up alongside May in Beverly Hills, said she felt “empty” following May's death and shared photos of their friendship group celebrating her 38th birthday the year before she died. Kardashian marked May's first “heavenly birthday” alongside their “lifer” friends Allison Statter, Simone Harouche and Sarah Meyer Michaelson at a lake house, which the reality star described as May's “happy place”. “It was just your birthday and I know you never liked to make a big deal of it, but Happy Heavenly Birthday, Lindz,” Kardashian wrote in the tribute shared to Instagram. “I waited months to post this, mostly because I couldn't find the right words. Nothing really captures how quiet and empty our lifers chat feels without you in it. I know you'd probably roll your eyes at me posting anything – especially since you didn't really even have social media – but I couldn't go through this lake trip without feeling you everywhere, and I needed to share it. “The lake was your happy place. It made you feel lighter, healthier… you were you. It'll always be our favourite lifers tradition because it's where we spend time with all of our kids being together and get real time with each other without any outside noise. We felt your absence this year in every sunset, every laugh, every quiet moment. “Looking back at these pictures from a year ago, I feel so grateful for all the memories we made. We miss you so f***ing much, Lindz. Our world is not the same without you. I guess that's why I hold onto this lake tradition so tightly. We'll always have the lake – and in that, we'll always have a piece of you.” May was the founder of Mayflower Entertainment, a consulting agency that connected high-end brands such as Gucci with partners in the entertainment industry. Kardashian and her “lifer” friendship group all attended Marymount High School in Bel Air, California when the reality star lived in Beverly Hills, then later in Calabasaas. The Skims founder previously shared a “Lifers Appreciation Post” showing her gratitude to her long term friends. “Life is better when you have your lifers!” she wrote, alongside an infinity symbol."

mov_664DF439037CF0C2B99E1E9F0965240F,2025-07-06 11:25:18,it,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[it]Si scrive Tedx e non ha nulla a vedere con Tex, il fumetto pubblicato dal 1958. È un evento. La «x» finale indica che viene organizzato localmente in modo indipendente, ma su licenza ufficiale concessa da Ted (acronimo di technology, entertainment, design, tecnologia, intrattenimento, design), organismo no profit con sede a New York, fondato nel 1984 da Richard Saul Wurman, architetto e designer, e Harry Marks, esperto di televisione e media. Nella nostra città esiste dal 2014 per iniziativa di Francesco Magagnino: «Alla prima conferenza vennero 150 persone nella sala più piccola della Gran Guardia», ricorda. Oggi in due giorni raduna più di 2.000 partecipanti, mobilita dai 60 agli 80 relatori, organizza oltre 20 laboratori, trova 72 sponsor, impegna 100 volontari. Il tutto all'insegna della gratuità: «Nessuno guadagna nulla». Il team di Tedx Verona, composto da circa 35 professionisti delle più svariate discipline che lavorano pro bono al progetto, è oggi uno dei primi fra i 220 esistenti in Italia. È divenuto talmente importante che il presidente Magagnino nei giorni scorsi è stato nominato dai dirigenti newyorchesi ambassador ufficiale della fondazione per l'Italia, al pari di Emilia Garito di Tedx Roma, ingegnera informatica. Però l'ambasciatore veronese, 43 anni, laureato in ingegneria e in economia all'Università di Trento, sposato con Claudia di Stefano, che lavora in Ibm, padre di Matilde (2 anni) e Olivia (nata a marzo), abituato da 15 anni a dividersi fra Milano e Verona, all'hobby culturale di Tedx ha affiancato un prestigioso incarico professionale: è responsabile per l'Italia, la Grecia e i Paesi dell'Est dell'area Ai (Artificial intelligence) di Accenture Song commerce, la divisione creativa e tecnologica focalizzata su marketing, design, esperienza cliente e trasformazione digitale. In pratica accompagna le aziende nell'uso dell'Intelligenza artificiale, o Ia che dir si voglia, per migliorare la relazione con i loro clienti. Lo fa in questa multinazionale nata dalla fusione delle parole accent e future, sede legale a Dublino, oltre 740.000 dipendenti nel mondo, fatturato annuo intorno ai 65 miliardi di dollari, presente in più di 120 Paesi. Accenture è uno dei colossi della consulenza insieme a Deloitte, Pwc, Kpmg, Ey e McKinsey. Magagnino deve la sua intelligenza naturale al padre Mario, docente nella facoltà di scienze della comunicazione dell'Università di Verona, e alla madre Marilina Sperandio, già insegnante di diritto ed economia all'istituto Pindemonte. Partiamo da Tedx. «C'entra la passione per il mondo digitale. Da bambino misi le mani sul primo computer, un 286 di fabbricazione russa, credo, di quelli con il monitor monocromatico e i caratteri a fosfori verdi su sfondo nero. Lo usavo nell'ufficio di papà per giocare a Tetris su un floppy disk gigante. Al primo anno di superiori mi fu regalato un pc tutto mio». C'è relazione con Tedx? «Sì, perché Tedx è un momento di incontro tra persone che sono appassionate di innovazione digitale. La mia tesi di laurea verteva sui sistemi adattivi, le tecnologie che hanno preceduto quelle di oggi. Partivamo dai modelli usati nella psicoanalisi per studiare la relazione uomo-uomo e li applicavamo alla relazione uomo-macchina». Roba da emicrania. «Due anni e mezzo fa è arrivata l'Intelligenza artificiale generativa, che ha cambiato le regole del gioco. Prima era una faccenda per super esperti, oggi aiuta le imprese a ottimizzare organizzazione e processi produttivi, a creare nuovi servizi. Tre lustri fa avevo vissuto la rivoluzione digitale nelle aziende. Ricorda quando Time nel 1982 mise in copertina il pc e lo proclamò ""Man of the year"", l'uomo dell'anno? Beh, qui siamo a una velocità mai vista prima. Da un cambiamento intergenerazionale siamo passati a uno stagionale». E Tedx lo racconta. «Presenta storie di lavoro, di sacrificio, di persone, di idee. Ha senso condividerle. Ho scoperto realtà aziendali veronesi straordinarie, come Clx, che ogni anno crea 250.000 immagini per Louis Vuitton, Dior, Celine, Gucci, Fendi, Versace, Bulgari, Ferragamo e altre griffe, e per riviste come Vogue, che le usano per pubblicità, app, web e stampa. Ricordo ancora l'avvincente relazione di Massimo Delledonne, professore ordinario di genetica all'Università di Verona, che fu il primo a scrivere la sua tesi di laurea con il pc, mentre i suoi colleghi ancora usavano la Olivetti Lettera 22. Nel 2014 ci preconizzò: ""Un giorno in farmacia ci daranno medicine compatibili con il nostro patrimonio cromosomico"". Aveva sequenziato per anni il Dna di tutti gli esseri viventi, a cominciare dal suo». Perché Ted ha nominato ambassador proprio lei? «L'evento annuale di Verona, del quale sono licenziatario, è uno dei più qualificati in Italia. Nel 2023 vennero qui 300 organizzatori di Tedx nel mondo, persino dall'Argentina, dal Giappone, dai Paesi arabi». Ha ospitato relatori famosi. «Molti. Fra loro, Simon Lancaster, l'ex ghost-writer del premier britannico Tony Blair. La sua relazione sul linguaggio segreto che assicura la leadership a chi raggiunge i vertici della politica e degli affari, tenuta a Tedx Verona nel 2016, finora è stata vista su Youtube da 4,7 milioni di persone». Sfruttate i social. «Parecchio. Abbiamo un pubblico giovane. Impressiona il fatto che a ogni nuovo evento almeno 180 candidati, in prevalenza donne, aderiscano all'appello per venire come volontari ad aiutare in Tedx». Come si chiamano coloro che partecipano a questi incontri? «Qualcuno li definisce tedxers, in italiano tedxari». Ho notato che hanno tutti la barba, tranne lei...."

mov_BF4C9DBB5B1B53D4857E0B2EF2044746,2025-07-06 12:00:18,id,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[id]Liputan6.com, Jakarta - Sebuah studi yang diterbitkan pada 23 Juni 2025 oleh organisasi nonpemerintah Inggris Earthsight menyebut bahwa merek-merek fesyen mewah internasional membeli kulit dari perusahaan-perusahaan yang terkait dengan peternakan yang memelihara sapi di tanah adat dan di daerah-daerah yang ditebangi secara ilegal di Amazon. Melansir Brasil de Fato, Sabtu (5/7/2025), investigasi yang dilakukan dalam kemitraan dengan Repórter Brasil ini menganalisis keputusan pengadilan, citra satelit, dan catatan pengiriman. Laporan ini juga meneliti rantai pasar di sektor tersebut untuk mengungkap jaringan pasokan kulit dari merek-merek, seperti Chanel, Balenciaga, dan Gucci. Menurut Earthsight, perusahaan pengepakan daging Brasil Frigol berada di dasar rantai produksi ini. Rumah pemotongan hewan tersebut diidentifikasi sebagai pembeli sapi yang dipelihara di tanah yang diembargo karena penebangan hutan, serta dari peternakan yang didirikan secara ilegal di Tanah Adat Apyterewa di São Félix do Xingu, negara bagian Pará. Studi tersebut menunjukkan bahwa hampir semua kulit yang diekspor dari Pará ke Eropa ditujukan ke Italia. Sebagian dari produk ini dibeli Conceria Cristina dan Faeda, perusahaan penyamakan kulit dari Veneto, Italia, tempat bahan tersebut diproses dan diberi merek baru sebagai ""kulit Italia."" Perusahaan-perusahaan ini memasok lusinan merek fesyen, otomotif, dan desain interior mewah. Selain Chanel, Balenciaga, dan Gucci, Conceria Cristina memasok kulit yang diperoleh di Brasil ke merek mewah Amerika Serikat (AS), Coach, yang menargetkan Generasi Z dan menjual tas dengan harga antara 340─686 dolar AS (sekitar Rp5,5 juta─Rp11,1 juta), yang dianggap ""mudah dijangkau"" di pasar barang mewah. Hubungan komersial antara Coach dan Conceria Cristina dikonfirmasi pada peneliti Earthsight oleh juru bicara dari perusahaan penyamakan kulit Italia. Investigasi tersebut menyoroti Durlicouros, eksportir terbesar dari Pará ke Eropa, sebagai pemasok utama bagi perusahaan-perusahaan Italia. Menurut laporan ekspor yang dianalisis Earthsight, Durlicouros telah mengekspor 90 persen dari semua kulit yang diproduksi di Pará ke Italia dari 2020 hingga 2023, dengan total 14.700 ton. Durlicouros mengonfirmasi pada Earthsight bahwa mereka membeli kulit binatang dari Frigol. Frigol adalah salah satu dari lima perusahaan pengemasan daging terbesar di Brasil, dengan kapasitas untuk menyembelih 2.400 ekor sapi per hari di fasilitasnya di Pará, menurut studi Earthsight. Pada Oktober 2024, Institut Lingkungan Hidup dan Sumber Daya Alam Terbarukan Brasil (IBAMA) mendenda Frigol dan perusahaan pengemasan daging lain karena membeli 18 ribu ekor sapi yang dibesarkan di kawasan hutan Amazon yang gundul di negara bagian Pará dan Amazonas. Investigasi Earthsight memperoleh dokumen yang, menurut LSM tersebut, menunjukkan bahwa Frigol membeli 3.643 ekor sapi yang dibesarkan secara ilegal di dua wilayah yang diembargo di sebuah peternakan di São Félix do Xingu pada 2019. Perusahaan tersebut didenda hampir 360 ribu dolar AS karena memperoleh hewan dari wilayah yang diembargo di mana pemeliharaan sapi dilarang. Kendati demikian, menurut LSM Inggris tersebut, antara Januari 2020 hingga Oktober 2023, Frigol tetap membeli ternak dari lokasi yang wilayahnya diembargo. Earthsight menganalisis citra satelit untuk membuktikan bahwa tidak ada cukup waktu untuk pemulihan wilayah yang ditebang secara ilegal tersebut. Menanggapi Earthsight, Frigol menyatakan bahwa pihaknya belum mengidentifikasi kejanggalan apapun di antara para pemasok yang dituduh membeli ternak yang dibesarkan di Tanah Adat Apyterewa. Perusahaan tersebut juga menegaskan bahwa kebijakan pembeliannya sejalan dengan ""Boi na Linha,"" protokol pemantauan untuk pembelian ternak yang dikembangkan LSM Imaflora dalam kemitraan dengan MPF. Menurut Frigol, 100 persen ternak yang dibeli dari pemasok langsungnya dibesarkan sesuai kriteria sosial-lingkungan. Perusahaan tersebut juga mengklaim dapat memantau pemasok tidak langsungnya di tingkat pertama. Dalam pernyataan yang dikirim ke Repórter Brasil, perusahaan pengemasan daging tersebut menekankan bahwa pihaknya ""mengklarifikasi secara terperinci setiap hipotesis yang disajikan"" dalam laporan Earthsight, ""yang menunjukkan bahwa semua pembelian sesuai sosial-lingkungan."" Frigol menyoroti komitmennya terhadap Perjanjian Penyesuaian Perilaku untuk Peternakan Sapi Berkelanjutan di Negara Bagian Pará (TAC da carne). Perjanjian ini, yang ditetapkan pada 2009, mengharuskan perusahaan pengemasan daging berkomitmen tidak memperoleh ternak dari daerah yang ditebangi secara ilegal di Amazon setelah tahun 2008."

n1mkvz5,2025-07-06 12:50:16,en,REDDIT,"  Nic is a massive NO it genuinely actually fucks with healing so it's a NONO Whereas THC has more of an effect on after pain and anesthesia effectiveness. So realistically if the Drs are 100% aware of the thc (frequency, amount, most recent smoke) everything should be gucci coz they will adjust accordingly and move on. Problems arise when ppl hide or lie about using THC and the drs and faced with a body thst is not reacting as they expected it would under the medication. So the anaesthesia could not be enough, not be effective enough. Some ppl say that because weed alters ur pain tolerance they actually have MORE pain after surgery coz they won't be able to smoke a lil after so their body doesn't have the THC to numb pain. Either way I suggest 1. stopping THC 48hrs prior coz u don't want ut activlt effecting you any time near ur surgery, 2. Tell the ansestiologist absolutely everything the complete truth even if u slip up and smoke that morning, tell them 3. Dont smoke for maybe a week atleast after, let ur stitches heal and scars start to form then see how ur doing 4. If they give you opiodes for pain meds do not smoke or do not mix them Congrats on the surgery coming up"

UgztVaqX2tKLxyE7Eh14AaABAg.AKCoxDRHHV7AKEqICz1F6P,2025-07-06 15:10:02,en,YOUTUBE,"  @@AriesGirl77 In March 2018, a server at the Los Angeles celebrity hotspot Delilah was brutally beaten in an assault caught on the restaurant's surveillance cameras. The server, Bennett Sipes, sued the restaurant, the rapper Drake, the Cleveland Browns wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr., and the model Younes Bendjima over the incident. Sipes claims that Drake ordered the beating after making a ""throat slash"" gesture to his entourage. Insider started digging into Drake and his relationship with Delilah's parent company, The H.Wood Group, which owns more than a dozen clubs, restaurants, and bars in Los Angeles. We discovered a close relationship between Drake and H.Wood's owners, who have put their employees at risk to curry favor with their celebrity clientele. Anthony “Hush” Palman Hush's name is very fitting because he's a very private guy. You'll have a hard time finding much information about him on the internet. I was only able to learn two things about him: he's also from the streets and probably collaborates with Drake on music. Drake rapped about him on Miss Me which establishes him another OVO affiliate who is with the shits,""Hush has got a gun."" - Miss Me, 2010. Furthermore, he used to be a solo artist under the name ""Young Tony"" and all of his songs are gangster rap songs about the streets of Canada. Hush did a very rare interview in 2005 and talked about growing up in the streets and doing ""mean shit"" to people, ""I grew up all over the city, mainly in Scarborough though. But I was always the crazy one out of the group. People called me Treach while I was growing up. My real friends still do. I got that name from my boys because I used to do some mean shit to people. So they started calling me Tony Treacherous, Treach for short. But for obvious reasons I couldn't use that name in the rap game, so one day someone called my Young Tony. I just stuck with it. But on the street, niggas still call me Treach. "" Preme (formerly known as P. Reign) Arrested for cocaine trafficking in 2004. The 25-year-old was charged with nine counts of weapon possession after three loaded handguns were found in his Cadillac in the early hours of March 8, 2008. He is one of the founding member of Reps Up Gang. Gillastein Preme's elder brother, another founding member of the Reps Up Gang and a close friend of Drake. Drake rapped about Gilla on No Long Talk, ""If Gilla call shots, no questions"". Based on that line, it appears that Gilla is also involved in the street side of things. Gilla appeared in a scene in Nav's music video for Price On My Head when The Weeknd said, ""niggas on your side, they would ride for me too"". Considering the context of the song, The Weeknd is most likely saying that Gilla who was formerly one of Drake's shooters is now on his side. Baka Drake signed rapper Baka Not Nice, a longtime member of his inner circle, to his record label, OVO Sound. His real name is Travis Savoury, and he has convictions for armed robbery and assault. In 2015, he pleaded guilty to assaulting a woman, drawing a six-month sentence. Procuring and human trafficking charges were dropped*<b>. *</b> All of Baka's music is street related which adds to his street image. A very common phrase associated Baka is ""no long talk"" which in my opinion means he doesn't like to waste his time talking and would rather get to the violence real quick. In a 2018 interview, Baka says he labeled himself as ""Drake's"" goon and heavily implied that he'll protect Drake by violent means. On ""No Long Talk"", Drake rapped about Baka saying, ""That's Baka, he's a no long talka, quick to let the motherfuckin' TEC slam"". Rumor: A user on KTT explained how Drake's relationship with Baka formed, ""Before drake blew up, he used to have beef with some other Toronto rappers and I think after he got jumped or something, drake reached out and linked up with repsup since they had a presence in the ""mean"" Toronto streets lol. Baka like preign is repsup but also reps ovo. Add to the fact that drake loves ****s and Baka used to sell em, seems like a perfect pairing lol"". Chubbs goes by the nickname ""Capo"" and is known for being Drake's right-hand man and bodyguard. Drake referenced him by the name Capo on his Instagram <a href=""https://www.instagram.com/p/BWYS5z-jjzQ/?hl=en"">https://www.instagram.com/p/BWYS5z-jjzQ/?hl=en</a>. The origin of word ""capo"" is Italian and is associated with the Mafia. One of the dictionary definitions for it means, ""Caporegime / capo is a name for a captain in the mafia family, the family will consist of many captains and the boss which is a capo crimini."" The fact that Drake calls one of his friends a word that's related to the mafia is very ironic considering how often he's been rapping about the mafia. Although Chubbs looks as friendly as his name sounds, his musical references portray him as a violent person who's involved in the streets..."

mov_27BE02CBCEF34829295F83084B026868,2025-07-06 16:29:20,en,WEB,"  After a year of musical chairs in fashion, September is gearing up to be one of its biggest show months ever: with debut collections slated from new creative directors at brands including Matthieu Blazy at Chanel and ex-Balenciaga designer Demna at Gucci. On Sunday in Paris, Michael Rider, who recently succeeded Hedi Slimane at Celine, decided to get a head start. Acting as a sort of amuse bouche for how he plans to shape the brand's future, Rider showed a mixture of men's and womenswear. The show took place at the brand's sprawling atelier, a short hop from the Tuileries Garden. Guests included the actor Naomi Watts and, fresh from 18 months of South Korean military service, Kim Taehyung, from the K-pop band BTS, who attempted to shelter from the rain under a giant silk foulard that had been erected above a courtyard. It was a full-circle moment for Rider, an American designer who previously worked under Phoebe Philo during her tenure at the brand from 2008 to 2017. While fans of her work, known as “Philophiles”, had hoped Rider would reinstate that era of louche tailoring and minimalism, his opening looks quickly curtailed such expectations. Instead of oversized silhouettes, there was a series of skinny jeans and even skinner trousers, hugging calves so tightly, they should have come with a circulation warning. These lean silhouettes were a nod to his predecessor, Slimane, who honed his signature sharp-edged style during his stints at Saint Laurent and Dior Homme before introducing it to Celine. Despite initial criticism, Slimane proved lucrative for Celine's parent company LVMH. According to analysts, he was estimated to have doubled Celine's annual sales to €2.5bn (£2.1bn), transforming it into LVMH's third-largest brand, sitting behind Louis Vuitton and Dior. However, in October, he resigned with rumours of failed contract negotiations to blame. It's now up to Rider to pick up that moneyed baton. Rider's appointment comes at a difficult time in the fashion industry, with a significant slowdown across luxury markets (for the first quarter of 2025, LVMH reported a 4% sales drop across fashion and leather goods). At the annual general meeting in April 2024, LVMH's chief executive, Bernard Arnault, said: “Celine is chic, hip, sexy fashion for young people even if the prices are what they are, and it works.” Rather than wiping the slate clean, during this period of uncertainty, it appears that Rider is set on evolving on the brand's existing tried and tested formula. Speaking backstage after the show, Rider said he “did not want there to be a sense of erasure”, adding that “there was a foundation to build on. That to me felt modern, it felt ethical, it felt strong.” Rider balanced this homage to the past by intertwining it with his own fashion story. There were nods to his American roots and recent stint as design director of Polo Ralph Lauren, with punchy, coloured knitted V-neck jumpers, neat Oxford shirts and striped ties. Simple evening looks in black including an off-the-shoulder dress and satin lapelled blazers seemed to subtly recall his previous time at Celine. Accessories, which are easier for luxury brands to shift than a £5k coat, were a focus. Models' fingers came covered in multiple gold and primary coloured rings. Chunky bangles were stacked on forearms. Giant chain link necklaces were mishmashed. Keyrings jingled with everything from dices to miniature Eiffel Towers. Rider said he wanted to inject an element of fun. “I would never want to be perceived as cynical. Having a sense of humour in the luxury space is a beautiful thing,” he said. Bags ranging from colossal woven baskets and enormous leather totes to dainty pouches were emblazoned with logos ranging from a simple C to a “Triomphe” monogram, first created by the house's founder Céline Vipiana in 1971. Rider said he was drawn to a logo's fluid nature. “They can move from something really tasteful to quickly something that is very different from that. They can be many things.”"

mov_BA4651CBD2F0CF859947F62949EB3BB2,2025-07-06 16:31:18,no,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[no]Ankelsokker VS lange sokker Sommeren er her for alvor, og «sokkestriden» har fått ny vind i seilene.  PÅ FESTIVAL: «Gen Z-trenden» sokker i sandaler dokumentert på Coachella-festivalen i California i april i år. Foto: Amy Harris/ Invision/ AP/ NTB I fjor sommer meldte flere medier at ankelsokkene hadde gått ut av motebildet, og var som sunket i den jorda de jo alltid har befunnet seg i nærheten av.  Kort fortalt En «sokkestrid» mellom millennials og Gen Z har oppstått de siste åra, der synlige sokker symboliserer en ny generasjonsidentitet. Motemagasiner diskuterer hvordan lange sokker kan brukes som et tydelig motetilbehør. Moteekspert Ida Elise Eide Einarsdóttir påpeker at tidligere motetabber - som sokker i sandaler - nå er akseptert. Gen Z foretrekker visstnok lange sokker, mens millennials kan velge å følge trenden eller holde seg til ankelsokker. Sammendraget er laget av ChatGPT og godkjent av Dagbladet. Vis mer Vis mindre Samtidig ble det bortimot satt likhetstegn mellom ankelsokkene og millennials (medlemmer av Millenniumsgenerasjonen; født mellom anslagsvis 1981 og 1996, journ.anm.), og mellom lange, synlige sokker og Gen Z (Generasjon Z, eller Zoomers, født mellom cirka 1997 og 2012, journ.anm.). Advarer mot farlig soltrend I mai måned omtalte Cosmopolitan sokkestriden mellom generasjonene som en «kulturkrig», og skrev at den igjen er blitt aktualisert med høyere temperaturer som bringer med seg sokkeavslørende plagg som shorts og sommerkjoler. - Det er som en slags generasjonskløft. Litt som med skinny jeansen eller sideskillen; referanser som blir klare identitetsmarkører og som for en ny generasjon skiller «oss» fra «dem». Sånn har det vel alltid vært, på sett og vis. Og sånn vil det også fortsette å være, sier mote- og skjønnhetsansvarlig i KK, Ida Elise Eide Einarsdóttir, til Dagbladet.  TILBAKE: Både sideskill og «skinny jeans» er blitt beskrevet som utdatert av Generasjon Z, men den siste tida har de sluppet begge deler inn i varmen. Her er Gen Z-medlem Kylie Jenner avbildet med sideskill på Schiaparelli-visningen under moteuka i Paris høsten 2024. Foto: Scott A. Garfitt/ Invision/ AP/ NTB Fra tabbe til mote Hvis man beveger seg rundt på sommerens mange festivaler eller generelt i bybildet i inn- og utland, er sjansen stor for at man får øye på medlemmer av de yngre generasjonene iført godt synlige sokker i alt fra sandaler og slippers til joggesko og loafers.  INFLUENSER: «It»-jente Hailey Bieber har nok vært medvirkende i å gjøre godt synlige sokker trendy - her fotografert med hvite, halvlange sokker i loafers i 2023. Foto: Christopher Peterson/ SplashNews/ NTB Motemagasinet InStyle har publisert en guide til hvordan man kan lykkes med stylingen av halvlange sokker til ulike typer fottøy, mens Vogue Business har påpekt at lange sokker er et billig og lett tilgjengelig statement. - Utvilsomt kontroversielt Einarsdóttir, som i likhet med undertegnede er en millennial, oppsummerer på følgende vis: - Det som er litt interessant er at ting som tidligere gjerne var såkalt fashion faux pas - altså motetabber - er nå helt innafor; som for eksempel sokker i sandalene. Det kan gjøre det litt vrient å henge med. Men det er godt mulig det også er litt av poenget. Samtidig så skal en ny generasjon oppdage trender fra «fordums tid» som om det var for aller første gang. Som med de åletrange buksene, for eksempel. Det skaper en kløft mellom oss som allerede har levd dem, og de unge som først nå oppdager trenden, sier hun til Dagbladet. INNAFOR: Synlige sokker kan bli et effektfullt motetilbehør med riktig styling. Foto: Luca Ponti/ APA Agency/ NTB «ALT» LOV (UNNTATT ANKELSOKKER): Synlige sokker kan brukes i så å si alle typer sko, og gjerne over både strømpebukser og tights. Foto: Luca Ponti/ IPA Agency/ NTB Moteeksperten påpeker at både millennials og de eldre generasjonene er godt kjent med synlige sokker fra tidligere, men fra starten av 2000-tallet ble ankelsokker og helt «usynlige» sokker populære.  STILFULLT: Lange hvite tennissokker i sandaler og joggesko er lov! Foto: NTB - Hva gjelder synlige sokker er det utvilsomt altså igjen blitt en greie. Forvirrende for oss som er vokst opp i troen om at det var det motsatte som gjaldt, men dog. Men de skal altså være høye, og gjerne tennissokker. Og de skal være hvite. Ja, hvis de skal i sandaler eller joggesko, altså. Det har jo vi som er født på midten av 80-tallet allerede vært igjennom minst én gang...."

mov_55001C7B0386BB1E7EDFB23DFAE012BA,2025-07-06 19:13:27,en,WEB,"  ABSTRACT Contrary to the president's assertions, records filed in a fraud case against him suggest that his riches were not the product of a steady and strong empire. FULL TEXT Last spring, even as Donald J. Trump's march back toward the White House dominated public attention, his finances, largely out of view, faced serious threats. His office building in Lower Manhattan generated too little cash to cover its mortgage, with the balance coming due. Many of his golf courses regularly lacked enough players to cover costs. The flow of millions of dollars a year from his stint as a television celebrity had mostly dried up. And a sudden wave of legal judgments threatened to devour all his cash. Then, with his clinching of the Republican nomination, everything began to change. In the following months, Mr. Trump, along with his two eldest sons, Eric and Donald Jr., refocused the family business, forming a series of partnerships, especially in cryptocurrency, with investors who were willing to bank on his victory. Once Mr. Trump won the presidency in November, that approach kicked into overdrive. His family business announced numerous new deals that would financially benefit Mr. Trump directly, even as he made policy decisions that affected those industries or that involved countries in which the United States had political interests. Most glaringly, Mr. Trump is now both a partner in several crypto ventures and, as president, crypto's chief policy regulator, and he has signaled that he wants his administration to have a hands-off approach to digital currencies. Today, those moves are seen by Mr. Trump's detractors as a money grab of historic proportions. But an analysis by The New York Times of thousands of pages of internal Trump Organization documents filed in one of the legal actions against him suggests a more urgent motivation for Mr. Trump's behavior: a need, rather than simply a desire, for easy money to keep his empire intact. In late 2023, Mr. Trump boasted of having between $300 million and $400 million in cash when he testified as part of that legal action, a lawsuit brought by the New York attorney general that accused the Trumps of defrauding their lenders. His cash stockpile, Mr. Trump said, showed ""how good a company I built,"" and, he added in earlier testimony, ""especially for a developer."" Contrary to those assertions, records filed in the fraud case suggest that Mr. Trump's cash was not the product of a steady and strong empire. His balance had fluctuated wildly, hitting a low of $52 million in 2018, a small figure for the size of his operation. The subsequent increase came largely from the sale of properties and a payout of more than $150 million from a passive investment. Moreover, the version of Mr. Trump's business that he projects - a real estate development company that executes large, complex tasks - hasn't existed for a nearly a decade, since the Trumps' last two major construction projects failed to make money. Instead, Mr. Trump's wealth is now built on monetizing the family name in new ways and, intentionally or not, the office of the presidency. It is an enterprise in pursuit of multimillion-dollar checks - from actual real estate developers, from cryptocurrency and social media enterprises run by others. It is also a business that hawks Trump-branded trinkets like watches and gold-toned mobile phones to the president's passionate supporters. Many of the deals open multiple channels for anyone to funnel cash to a sitting president, often in ways that are untraceable under current disclosure requirements. And because some of what is being sold is use of the president's name, there are no clear metrics to gauge whether he has received market rate, a premium because of his office or, in effect, a hopeful bribe. The White House press secretary, Karoline Leavitt, has said that Mr. Trump abides by all conflict-of-interest laws and acts with only the interests of the American public in mind. In response to questions from The Times, Eric Trump, who runs his father's businesses, issued a written statement saying the company is stronger than ever and largely debt free thanks to ""the most iconic"" properties and ""cryptocurrency ventures on Earth."" ""I have never been more proud of our company,"" the statement said. ""Our portfolio is operating flawlessly, and 2025 will mark the strongest year in the remarkable history of the Trump Organization."" Perfectly assessing Mr. Trump's privately held businesses at any point in time is nearly impossible. But within months of his testimony in the New York civil fraud trial, all of his cash and liquid investments looked to be at risk. His businesses had often required cash infusions before a judge in the trial entered a judgment against the Trumps of $355 million. Mr. Trump faced a second judgment of $88.3 million in the sexual abuse and defamation lawsuits brought by writer E. Jean Carroll. Mr. Trump has not yet had to pay the judgments, which now total more than $600 million with interest. But he did have to put up cash totaling $175 million in the fraud case, and cash and bonds totaling $97 million in Ms. Carroll's cases, to pursue appeals. He also faced a potential hit of $100 million from a longstanding tax audit, though it now appears unlikely that his political appointees at the Internal Revenue Service would sign off on such an assessment - another benefit of having returned to the Oval Office. To be sure, Mr. Trump was not facing a calamity. He could have sold more properties, at the expense of his family's future wealth, to cover any shortfall. The Trumps found a different path. ""His approach to almost everything at this point now seems to be that he's going to get away with whatever he can get away with, and sort of dare people to try to find legal or political ways to stop him,"" said Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, a liberal-leaning nonprofit group. Escalator to Nowhere When Mr. Trump completed construction on Trump Tower four decades ago, its five-floor atrium was filled with luxury retailers from around the globe - Asprey of London, Buccellati, Cartier - creating a destination for high-end shoppers and tourists alike. Those spaces, and the office rentals above, provided Mr. Trump with one of his most reliable sources of profits for decades, a 2020 analysis of his tax returns by The Times found. The famed shimmering escalators leading up to the top retail floors are now roped off, the stores there having departed over the years. Two smaller spaces on the ground floor and below offer Trump-branded merchandise, like license-plate frames and sweatshirts. The atrium's signature design feature - a multistory marble water wall - has been turned off and covered by a large U.S. flag. Only one major retailer remains: Gucci, in the one space with visibility from the sidewalk. At 40 Wall Street, Mr. Trump's office tower in Lower Manhattan, 25 percent of the building has been vacant since last year. In March, Fitch Ratings reported that, after covering basic expenses, the building generated $2 million per year less than Mr. Trump needed for his mortgage payments, and in a few years he will face a multimillion-dollar jump in the rent he pays for the ground under the building...."

1ltadlj,2025-07-06 19:54:43,en,REDDIT,"  I recently placed a test order with the new OGWAVE link and wanted to compare it with the old one. Verdict: same level of quality, still super clean. I ordered two caps: – a black Fendi – a Gucci The Fendi is very structured and rigid, just like retail. The embroidery is crisp, zero flaws. The Gucci is a bit softer in shape but the finish is equally on point: clean logo, no loose threads, visually very convincing. I compared them side by side with retail in-store and honestly you wouldn't notice the difference. This is top-tier rep quality. I reached out to the seller via WhatsApp. He was a little slow to reply at first, but after that everything went smoothly. I used the code “ogwave168” to simply unlocks his Yupoo album (not a discount code). He sent me his prices and some extra photos. Payment was straightforward, no issues. The package took 12 days to arrive in France, with 3 days held by customs, but it cleared without any fees or intervention. Discreet packaging, nothing suspicious on the outside. Important note: this Hidden1to1 contact is the real newOGWAVE. Any others using his photos or claiming to be him are either resellers, fakes, or outright scams. This WhatsApp number is the direct source. Be careful if you see “OGWAVE” elsewhere. I only have 4 photos to share here for now, but I filmed the entire unboxing. I just don't know how to post a video on the sub. If anyone needs it, I can share it another way.

8a25b2dec4419c574181b149c1872297,2025-07-06 20:12:00,lv,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[lv]Cits “Viena no lietām, ar ko es lepojos visvairāk…”: nespēlēšana, 2-kārtējais Oskara kandidāts Ādams Draivers nekad neaizmirsīs, ka kādreiz bija jūras kājnieks — kāpēc viņš tika izraidīts no korpusa? Ādams Draivers ir viens no spilgtākajiem pašreizējās paaudzes aktieriem, kurš nealkst slavu un uzmanību, bet gan koncentrējas uz labu darbu. Viņam pēdējā laikā ir sniegtas dažas no nobriedušākajām un pamatotākajām izrādēm ar tādām filmām kā Patersons, Klusums, Ziņojums, Laulību stāsts, Pēdējais duelis , un Gucci māja . Viņš ir visvairāk atzīts par Kylo Ren lomu spēlē Zvaigžņu kari turpinājumu triloģija. Viņš ir spēcīgs izpildītājs, kurš var uzņemties jebkuru viņam uzticēto lomu un nodrošināt izcilus un neaizmirstamus priekšnesumus. Pirms kļūšanas par aktieri, Draivers pēc 2001. gada 11. septembra uzbrukumiem brīvprātīgi pieteicās dienēt ASV Jūras korpusā. Taču viņa pavadītais laiks tika saīsināts negadījuma dēļ. Taču Drivers joprojām ir ļoti lepns par kādu laiku dienēšanu armijā un pat izvirza to augstāk par savu pašreizējo aktiera darbu. Lasiet arī: “Kāpēc tāds liels uzņēmums kā Netflix un Amazon nevar?” : Zvaigžņu karu aktieris Ādams Draivers apkauno straumēšanas milžus par to, ka viņi neatbalsta cilvēkus, ar kuriem viņi strādā. Ādams Draivers apgalvo, ka būt par jūrnieku bija viņa dzīves lepnākais brīdis Ādams Šoferis tagad ir pieprasīts aktieris Holivudā, pateicoties viņa daudzpusībai un dabiskajai aktiermākslas dotībai. Bet pirms viņš iesaistījās aktiermākslā, viņš iepriekš bija uzticīgs un lepns jūras kājnieks, kuram viņš kalpoja divus gadus un astoņus mēnešus. Taču kalnu riteņbraukšanas negadījums pārtrauca viņa jūras kājnieka karjeru, un viņš bija izpostīts. Viņš izteica, ka būt par jūras kājnieku bija lepnākā lieta viņa dzīvē TED sarunas laikā (sa YouTube ). Viņš teica, “Man tas patika, man patika būt jūras kājniekam. Tā ir viena no lietām, ar ko savā dzīvē esmu paveicis visvairāk. Jūras korpuss man patika visvairāk par to, ko es vismazāk meklēju, kad pievienojos, proti, cilvēki. Dažus gadus manā dienestā un mēnešus pēc dislokācijas Irākā, kalnu riteņbraukšanas negadījumā izmežģīju krūšu kauli, un tas bija medicīniski nošķirts. Man bija ļoti postoši paziņot, ka netiku nosūtīts uz Irāku vai Afganistānu. Un tad pēkšņi es atkal kļuvu civilpersona. Šoferis arī stāstīja par to, kā viņam bija grūti pielāgoties civilajai dzīvei, sakot: 'Es domāju, ka visas civilās problēmas ir mazas salīdzinājumā ar militārajām problēmām. Bet es biju pārsteigts par to, cik sarežģīta bija pāreja no militārās uz civilo. Tas bija grūti, daļēji tāpēc, ka mācījos aktiermākslas skolā, kā arī tāpēc, ka nezināju, kā militārajā jomā apgūtās lietas pielietot civilajā kontekstā gan praktiski, gan emocionāli. Es cīnījos, lai atrastu jēgu, militārajā jomā visam bija nozīme. Civilajā pasaulē nav ranga, tu esi tikai vēl viens ķermenis, un es pastāvīgi jutu, ka man ir jāpierāda sava vērtība no jauna. Šoferis smagi strādāja un iekļuva Holivudā, pateicoties viņa apņēmībai un dabiskajam aktiera talantam. Viņa dzīvesstāsts ir iedvesmojošs un sniedz svarīgu morāli, ka ikviens var gūt panākumus jebko, ja vien ieliek tajā savu sirdi un dvēseli.

mov_73128F4F605401BDB64B9B418DCB4B50,2025-07-06 20:29:43,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Nach einem Jahr voller Musikstühle in der Mode ist der September eine seiner größten Showmonate aller Zeiten aller Zeiten vorbereitet: mit Debütsammlungen, die von neuen kreativen Direktoren bei Marken wie Matthieu Blazy bei Chanel und Ex-Balenciaga-Designer Demna bei Gucci abgefeuert wurden. Am Sonntag in Paris beschloss Michael Rider, der kürzlich Hedi Slimane bei Celine nachfolgt, einen Vorsprung. In einer Amuse-Bouche für die Art und Weise, wie er die Zukunft der Marke gestalten will, zeigte Rider eine Mischung aus Männern und Damenbekleidung. Die Show fand im weitläufigen Atelier der Marke statt, einem kurzen Sprung vom Tuileries Garden. Zu den Gästen gehörten der Schauspieler Naomi Watts und frisch aus 18 Monaten südkoreanischer Militärdienst, Kim Taehyung, von der K-Pop-Band BTS, die versuchte, unter einer riesigen Seide vor dem Regen zu schützen Das war über einem Innenhof errichtet worden. Für Rider, eine amerikanische Designerin, die zuvor während ihrer Amtszeit bei der Marke von 2008 bis 2017 unter Phoebe Philo arbeitete, war es ein Vollkreismoment. Während Fans ihrer Arbeit, bekannt als „Philophile“, gehofft hatten, dass Rider diese Ära der Louche -Schneiderei und des Minimalismus wieder einstellen würde, hat seine Eröffnungsaussehen solche Erwartungen schnell eingeschränkt. Anstelle von übergroßen Silhouetten gab es eine Reihe von Skinny -Jeans und sogar Skinner -Hosen, die Kälber so fest umarmten, dass sie mit einer Aufzirkulationswarnung einhergehen sollen. Diese mageren Silhouetten waren eine Anspielung auf seinen Vorgänger Slimane, der seinen charakteristischen, scharfkantigen Stil während seiner Stationen in Saint Laurent und Dior Homme verbesserte, bevor er ihn Celine vorstellte. Trotz anfänglicher Kritik erwies sich Slimane für die Muttergesellschaft LVMH von Celine lukrativ. Laut Analysten wurde er schätzungsweise den Jahresumsatz von Celine auf 2,5 Mrd. EUR (2,1 Mrd. GBP) verdoppelt und ihn hinter Louis Vuitton und Dior in die drittgrößte Marke von LVMH verwandelt. Im Oktober trat er jedoch unter Gerüchten über gescheiterte Vertragsverhandlungen zurück. Es liegt jetzt an Rider, diesen Geldstab zu holen. Die Ernennung von Rider erfolgt zu einer schwierigen Zeit in der Modebranche, wobei die Luxusmärkte erheblich verlangsamt haben (im ersten Quartal von 2025 meldete LVMH einen Umsatzrückgang von 4% gegenüber Mode- und Lederwaren). Auf der Jahreshauptversammlung im April 2024 sagte der Geschäftsführer von LVMH, Bernard Arnault,: „Celine ist schick, hip, sexy Mode für junge Menschen, auch wenn die Preise so sind, wie sie sind, und es funktioniert. “ Anstatt den Schiefer in dieser Zeit der Unsicherheit sauber zu löschen, scheint es, dass sich der Fahrer an der vorhandenen bewährten Formel der Marke weiterentwickelt. Nach der Show hinter der Bühne sagte Rider und sagte, er wollte nicht, dass es ein Gefühl der Löschung gibt “und fügte hinzu, dass” es eine Grundlage gibt, auf der ich mich aufbauen kann. Das fühlte sich modern, es fühlte sich ethisch an, es fühlte sich stark an. “ Rider balancierte diese Hommage an die Vergangenheit, indem er sie mit seiner eigenen modischen Geschichte verflechtete. Es gab Anspielungen auf seine amerikanischen Wurzeln und seine jüngste Zeit als Designdirektor von Polo Ralph Lauren, mit druckvollen, gefärbten Strick-Jumpern mit V-Ausschnitt, ordentlichen Oxford-Hemden und gestreiften Krawatten. Einfacher Abend sieht schwarz aus, einschließlich eines schulterfreien Kleides und der satinrafschen Blazer schienen sich an seine frühere Zeit bei Celine auf subtile Weise zu erinnern. Zubehör, die für Luxusmarken einfacher sind als ein Mantel von 5.000 Pfund, waren ein Fokus. Die Finger der Modelle wurden mit mehreren goldenen und primären farbigen Ringen bedeckt. Klobige Armreifen wurden auf Unterarmen gestapelt. Riesenkettenverbindungsketten wurden misshandelt. Keyrings schlängten mit allem, von Würfel bis zu Miniatur -Eiffeltürmen. Rider sagte, er wolle ein Element des Spaßes einbringen. “Ich würde niemals als zynisch empfunden werden. Ein Sinn für Humor im Luxusraum ist eine schöne Sache”, sagte er. Taschen, die von kolossalen gewebten Körben und riesigen Lederbeuteln bis hin zu zierlichen Beuteln reichen, wurden mit Logos, die von einem einfachen C bis zu einem „Triomphe“ -Monogramm reichen, das 1971 vom Gründer Céline Vipiana des Hauses erstellt wurde. Rider sagte, er sei von der fließenden Natur eines Logos angezogen. “Sie können sich von etwas, das wirklich Geschmackvolles zu etwas, das sich sehr davon unterscheidet, übergehen. Sie können viele Dinge sein.” Tags: PrevPreviousElder: Andere Präsidenten beschwerten"

mov_D06BA3C883BA5F69F3C7EE8E455434D7,2025-07-06 21:09:05,en,WEB,"  Keira Knightley and musician James Righton have been together for over a decade and share two children. Yet, the relationship took Knightley by surprise. In an interview with TimeOut in 2014, she admitted that marriage wasn't really on her to-do list before meeting Righton. “My parents are deeply hippy. They got married because it was the only way they could get a mortgage at the time,” Knightley explained. “I grew up with them going, 'Don't know why you'd ever get married.' And then we did. It's nice. It's been fun. Until it isn't and then you get divorced! Fingers crossed for the future.” Righton was famous in his own right before meeting Knightley, playing with his band The Klaxons. In 2017, he told the New York Post Here is Knightley and Righton's complete relationship timeline so far. 2011 In October 2014, Knightley told The Guardian “[We met] through our mate Tim, not Alexa Chung, as people keep telling me,” she said. “We were very drunk.” She added, “He's the sort of person who will be the brightest light in any room, whereas I'm the one who sits in the corner. And he's much nicer than me.” May 2012 In May 2012, the couple got engaged, according to Reuters, who spoke with the star's publicist at the time, Sara Keene, who simply said, “I can confirm that Keira is engaged to be married to James Righton.” May 2013 The couple were married approximately a year later on May 4, 2013, holding a small ceremony of only 11 people in the small town of Mazan in the South of France, British Vogue reported. There was a reception later at Knightley's mother's house for a larger group. Knightley wore a couture Chanel minidress made of tulle and laced with silver, covered by a white tweed jacket by Karl Lagerfeld. In an interview with Elle UK For their honeymoon, the couple went to Corsica and were photographed enjoying the beautiful beaches. Righton told NME that his band the Klaxons were not affected by his high-profile wife, explaining, “I just fell in love with someone who happens to be amazing. We had a beautiful wedding and there was a lot of love.” “The music is the music,” he continued. “That thing is going to be there because of who she is but I'd say we're a pretty established band.” Of the wedding, he shared, “It was the greatest day ever, it was fantastic. We're still high from it. It was about two weeks ago, it was a big party.” December 2013 Knightley wore her Chanel wedding dress on the red carpet for the SeriousFun Children's Network London Gala at the Roundhouse. December 2014 The pair were reported to be expecting their first child in late 2014. February 2015 Knightley baby bump was visible at the Hollywood and Highland Center in Los Angeles in her tulle Valentino gown at the 2015 Academy Awards. May 2015 On May 26, 2015, Knightley and Righton welcomed their first child, Edie Knightley Righton. In August that year, Knightley told ELLE, “The love thing is astonishing. It's a very primal, primal love. That's quite extraordinary...And the ability to have no sleep and continue going. It's not pleasant—I never thought that I could actually do it for the amount of time that I've done it.” May 2019 In 2019, the couple revealed they were expecting again when Knightley's baby bump was visible as she left the Chanel J12 cocktail party in Paris. September 2019 On Sept. 13, 2019, their second daughter, Delilah Knightley Righton, was born...."

mov_1AC97F430EB1F71B8F7421610D5AD56B,2025-07-06 21:50:41,en,WEB,"  Before they got married, Kirsten Dunst and Jesse Plemons dated for years and welcomed two sons. The couple knew they were the ones for each other whether or not there was a ring on it—though Dunst did wear an engagement ring for years before the ceremony. The two actors first met while working on the FX series Fargo in 2015 and started dating a year later. They still work together at times, most recently in the 2021 film The Power of the Dog, for which they both received their first Oscar nominations. Here's their complete relationship timeline from meeting to marriage. October 2015 When the two met on set, Dunst was still dating Garrett Hedlund. However, she and Plemons had immediate creative chemistry. In 2021, she told the LA Times, “We fell in love creatively first. He was like a creative soul mate to me and the way we both work. On Fargo, I knew after two weeks. I didn't remember saying this, but one of my best friends told me that I said to her that 'I will know this man for the rest of my life. I just know it.' Just because I felt such an immediate connection.” In a profile of Plemons by the New York Times During PaleyFest New York, Plemons praised his co-star and said of working with her, “It was a gift... I loved Kirsten's work for a long time, and I was really excited once I'd met her, and she's a great person, and we're both actors that just have fun with the material.” January 2016 With the rest of the Fargo cast, Dunst and Plemons attended the 21st Annual Critics' Choice Awards in Santa Monica, California. March 2016 The couple got together around this time, according to Dunst when speaking to the New York Times. “It was one of those connections where you just know,” she said. “But we're also very respectful people and were mindful of the fact that we were working together intensely. After we were done with the show, we'd FaceTime now and then, and I just missed him. I missed being around him. And he did, too. We didn't get together until the following March, when we'd had the time to realize how much we missed each other and how much we wanted to be in each others' lives.” May 2016 The couple was spotted kissing behind a fence in Los Angeles about a month after Dunst's split with Hedlund was confirmed. September 2016 They did not confirm their relationship, but Dunst shouted out Plemons' new film at the time, Other People, on Instagram, writing, “I LOVED this movie #otherpeople opens Sept 9th.” Later that month, they arrived separately at the Emmys, each nominated for Fargo. A source told E! News at the time that they got a bit handsy, adding Dunst “leaned into Jesse and very passionately kissed him on the lips after she caressed his cheek very affectionately.” They seemed “to be very much a couple” and remained “stuck to each other's sides all night.” January 2017 Dunst was spotted in January wearing a piece of jewelry that sure looked like an engagement ring, with Page Six confirming they became engaged over Golden Globes weekend. They were each seen separately at Paris Fashion Week soon after, with Dunst wearing the ring to the Ralph & Russo show. Then, Dunst was seen at the 28th Annual Palm Springs International Film Festival Film Awards Gala with her ring again. February 2017 Their first official appearance as a couple was at the 2017 Film Independent Spirit Awards. On the red carpet at the 2017 Oscars that month, E! asked Dunst about a possible wedding and she replied, “We have a time frame, but that's private!” May 2017 Dunst's movie The Beguiled premiered at the 70th annual Cannes Film Festival and Plemons was by her side. A few days later, they headed to Florence, Italy, for the Gucci Cruise 2018 fashion show. That month, Dunst was interviewed by Jimmy Fallon, and when asked about her relationship, she replied, “You're making me nervous!” “I've got to keep things private a little bit. We got together a year afterwards. We became really good friends first,” she continued. “You're like, 'Oh, I really love this person. I love hanging out with him.'” June 2017..."

mov_9209ADC110EA1B95B06BA40BC9E7FD89,2025-07-07 02:26:52,en,WEB,"  Provocative Georgian showman Demna is to take a final bow after 10 years at Balenciaga during Paris Haute Couture Week, which begins Monday and will also feature a debut for Maison Margiela's new chief creative. Demna, known for his daring work as well as controversies during his decade-long stint at Kering-owned Balenciaga, will unveil his final collection on Wednesday in what is expected to be one of the highlights of the week. Not to be confused with Paris Fashion Week, Haute Couture Week takes place exclusively in Paris — in January for spring-summer collections and July for autumn-winter. It is a uniquely French event dedicated to handcrafted, one-of-a-kind creations made to wear at red carpets, galas, and other high-profile events. The 44-year-old Demna, acclaimed by millennials and Gen-Z stars from Kim Kardashian to British pop sensation Charli XCX, has been tasked with reviving the flagging fortunes of Gucci by Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault. After multiplying sales at Balenciaga, where he made headlines with a $2,000 ""Ikea"" bag and a $1,800 so-called ""trash pouch"", he is currently being honoured with an exhibition titled ""Balenciaga by Demna"" at Kering's Paris headquarters. He will be succeeded by Italian designer Pierpaolo Piccioli, who is set to present his first collection in October during Paris Women's Fashion Week. As usual, Schiaparelli will open Couture Week, followed later in the day by shows from Iris Van Herpen —- returning after a year-long break -— as well as Georges Hobeika, Imane Ayissi, Rahul Mishra, Julie de Libran, and Giambattista Valli. After Demna's farewell on Wednesday, Belgian designer Glenn Martens will find himself in the spotlight as he unveils a first collection for Maison Margiela following his appointment in January to succeed British designer John Galliano. American designer Michael Rider, who succeeded Hedi Slimane as chief designer at Celine, unveiled his first collection for the luxury French brand on Sunday, outside the official calendar. – Absences – On Tuesday, Chanel will present the final collection created by its in-house design studio, the fifth since Virginie Viard's sudden departure in June 2024. More in Style Her successor, the discreet and highly respected Franco-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy, was appointed in December and will showcase his first collection for Chanel in October. Up to Thursday, 27 houses will unveil their creations, including Elie Saab, Armani Prive, Aelis, Viktor&Rolf, Adeline Andre, and Dubai-based Rami Al Ali who is set to become the first Syrian to join the official calendar. Following a spate of major changes at fashion houses, some absences will stand out, particularly Dior's. After a highly anticipated debut during the men's Fashion Week on June 27, newly appointed artistic director Jonathan Anderson is holding back his first haute couture collection for January 2026. Named in early June to lead Dior's women's and couture lines as well, the 40-year-old Northern Irishman has become the first person since founder Christian Dior himself to oversee all three branches of the house. Jean Paul Gaultier is also missing. Dutch designer Duran Lantink, appointed as the brand's permanent artistic director in April, will make his debut during Women's Fashion Week in October. Since stepping back in 2020, Jean Paul Gaultier has handed over the reins of his couture collections to a series of guest designers, including Olivier Rousteing, Ludovic de Saint Sernin, Haider Ackermann, and Simone Rocha.

This will help in the separation of powers, accountability and specialization of each business. When John D. Rockefeller JD4 split his Standard Oil into separate companies, his net worth increased. We don't need an anti-trust case but should proactively increase our wealth. Like Standard Oil, Alexander Graham Bell's AT&T is the father of all major telecommunications companies in the USA initially born as baby bells after an anti-trust case. With each business as a separately traded company, it is ripe for acquisition by a global giant like ExxonMobil Shell or Chevron. The retail business cna be acquired partly or fully by Amazon.com or Walmart. Apparel goes to Nordstrom ZARA Uniqlo India Gap Louis Vuitton Prada or Gucci. Airtel India and Jio become acquisition targets for T-Mobile AT&T NTT ソフトバンク（SoftBank） or Verizon. It becomes easier to access global markets with partial or full foreign ownership just like it was easier to align with the British Empire as a Zamindar or Princely State. JDR was comparable to the Rothschild family in modern times with their financial impact equalling the legacy of the Abrahamic Prophets. What is rich in terms of wealth and power is also sound from a spiritual, intellectual and emotional viewpoint."

mov_801B7660E2D45F44E563CE207FAC3500,2025-07-07 08:54:43,en,WEB,"  Designer brands such as Coach, Fendi and Hugo Boss have been listed as buyers of raw materials sourced from destroyed forests in Para, the northern Brazilian state set to host the UN Climate Conference, COP30, in November.The allegations, which most companies have denied, are detailed in a report published by Earthsight, a UK-based non profit focused on environmental and injustice investigations. Their findings draw on thousands of records of Brazilian leather exports, data on the cattle sector, court rulings and satellite imagery, as well as interviews and on-the-ground research. ""Consumers probably expect that when buying a luxury product, the high price tag guarantees some level of ethics and sustainability,"" Lara Shirra White, an Earthsight researcher, told DW. ""They don't expect that the leather bag might be linked to deforestation and human rights violations."" The NGO warns of products made from the hides of cattle reared on farms embargoed for environmental violations, including some operating illegally within Para's Apyterewa Indigenous Territory, which was heavily deforested during the presidency of Jair Bolsonaro from 2019 to 2022. As part of its research, Earthsight investigated the business operations of Frigol, a Brazilian meatpacking company identified as one of the buyers of cattle raised on the territory.The report says at least 17,000 animals were sold to Frigol between 2020 and 2023, which is ""enough to produce 425 tons of leather."" Researchers linked some of those cattle to illegal farms but said it's not possible to determine the exact number that left Apyterewa, in part because Frigol itself ""does not trace most of its indirect suppliers."" The report says this gap in reporting leaves the company's ""supply chain vulnerable to the widespread practice of 'cattle laundering,'"" in which cows from illegal farms are transferred to legally registered properties before being sold.Paulo Barreto, senior researcher at the Brazilian conservation and sustainable development Institute of Man and Environment of the Amazon, Imazon, said control over indirect suppliers is either nonexistent or incomplete. ""As a result, cattle raised in illegally deforested areas end up entering the market as if they were legal. The lack of a transparent public system regarding the origin of the cattle makes control difficult."" Frigol, however, told DW via email that it does not purchase cattle from Indigenous lands and monitors 100% of its direct suppliers. ""We are committed to working together with industry institutions, the production chain and public authorities to make progress,"" the company said in a statement. It added that it believes ""only individual traceability of animals for socio-environmental purposes will make it possible to mitigate deforestation across all links of the cattle supply chain."" According to Earthsight's research, after the animals are slaughtered at Frigol's facilities, a percentage of cow skins are exported, in part by the Brazilian leather company Durlicouros, which shipped 14,700 tons of hide to Italy between 2020 and 2023. Some of that, the report found, went to the Italian tanneries Conceria Cristina and Faeda.The research lists high-end names like Coach, Fendi, Chloé, Hugo Boss and Saint Laurent among Conceria Cristina's clients. Faeda, meanwhile, provides leather to brands such as Chanel, Balenciaga and Gucci, according to the investigation.In response to a DW request for comment, Chanel cited deforestation as a ""major concern"" and said it no longer works with Faeda due to unmet traceability requirements: ""92% of the calfskin we use is sourced from Europe, and we audit slaughterhouses and farms outside Europe to ensure they are not in deforestation zones.The Kering Group, which owns Balenciaga, Gucci, and Saint Laurent, told DW that while the two Italian companies mentioned in the report are suppliers, ""the leather they provide to any Kering house does not come from Brazil. ""Based on Earthsight's findings, Hugo Boss issued a statement to say it had conducted a detailed review, and could ""confirm that none of the leather"" it is supplied with ""is connected to any of the alleged parties in connection with the investigation. ""LVMH, which owns Fendi and Louis Vuitton, said it has a system capable of tracing the origin of 98% of the leather used in its products and that it does not source this from South America. And Tapestry, which owns the Coach brand, wrote to DW saying that while the system for tracking raw materials in Brazil is ""complex and imperfect,"" it is working to be ""part of the solution to improve traceability and transparency. ""Chloé, Conceria Cristina and Faeda had not responded to a DW request for comment at the time of publication.Durlicouros told DW that it tracks its indirect suppliers and participates in discussions on state and national models for full traceability and compliance."" In addition, all Durlicouros facilities are certified by the Leather Working Group (LWG), ensuring high standards of sustainability, traceability, and environmental responsibility, according to the purpose of each facility. ""But Earthsight researcher Lara Shirra White said companies often use the certification to vouch for the ethics and sustainability of the leather they produce ""instead of conducting meaningful due diligence themselves to ensure their supply chains are deforestation-free. ""She said the problem with the LWG, founded in 2005, is that ""it does not require traceability back to the farms,"" and can therefore not account for environmental and human rights abuses in the areas where the cattle are raised.The LWG told DW it is enhancing its ""due diligence requirements related to deforestation and land conversion,"" which will ""include establishing a chain of custody system that would support more detailed traceability across the leather value chain. ""There is some hope that the European Union's Deforestation Regulation (EUDR) could make a contribution to change. Due to come into effect at the end of this year after a 12-month delay, it will ban the purchase of products originating from destroyed forest areas. "" We hope the law will be implemented on schedule, despite certain sectors of the industry still trying, in some way, to exclude leather from the scope of the legislation,"" Rafael Pieroni, a researcher at Earthsight, told DW.However, he said the report also contains a message for the Brazilian government. "" It should implement traceability and make all data public. Transparency is the best way to avoid all the illegalities we are exposing in our investigation,"" he said."

mov_3DB2B71E315E1E218D558EECD33BF5BF,2025-07-07 09:32:56,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Eines der größten Schönheitsunternehmen der Welt ist Berichten zufolge einen Verkauf von sich selbst. Anfang Juni berichtete WWD, dass Coty erwägt, seine Verbraucher- und Prestige-Divisionen zu veräußern, darunter einige der bekanntesten Marken von Beauty wie Covergirl sowie Chloé- und Hugo-Chef-Parfums. Die Ankündigung versetzte den Aktienkurs von Coty 13 Prozent auf 5 USD; Die Veräußerung beider Waffen würde im Wesentlichen mehr als 120 Jahre als Unternehmen beendet. Coty lehnte es ab, sich zu dem Bericht zu äußern. Trotz seiner Größe und Stall bekannter Namen hat das amerikanische Konglomerat in den letzten Jahren Schwierigkeiten, mit seinen Konkurrenten Schritt zu halten. Innerhalb des Portfolios seines größten Anteilseigners Jab Holdings ist Coty das schlechteste Kapital und senkt den Ausblick im letzten Geschäftsjahr, wobei weitere Umsatzrückgänge projiziert werden. Coty hat versucht, sein Ansehen zu verbessern. Seit seinem derzeitigen CEO Sue Nabi im Jahr 2020 eintraf, hat das Unternehmen das Fett getrimmt und nicht-Kernmarken wie Professional Lines Wella und OPI abgebrochen. Aber es bleibt immer noch seine äußeren Kollegen wie L'Oréal und Elf Beauty zurück, und im Mai verkaufte es Skkn von Kim, der Prestige-Hautpflegemarke, an seinen Gründer zurück, den Multi-Hyphenate-Reality-Star Kim Kardashian und ihre Bekleidungsfirma Skims, nachdem die Marke versäumt hatte, mit Schaufenster für Furore zu machen. Die Kerngeschäfte, Duft- und Drogerie -Make -up, stehen ebenfalls unter Druck. Während der Duft die kategorische Kategorie der Branche ist und Coty einige der weltweit bekanntesten Düfte der Welt herstellt, ist der heftig wettbewerbsfähige Sektor mit neuen Herausforderern gefüllt. Die Bemühungen, das Summen wie trendige Körpermists für Calvin Klein und die Wiederbelebung von Marc Jacobs Beauty zu fördern, sind in einem von Nischenspieler und Tiktok -Viralität dominierten Markt ein Rückgang des Ozeans. Die Drogerie -Marken haben ebenfalls unterdurchschnittlich geschafft. “So ziemlich alles in der Messe hat nicht funktioniert … Ich gebe ihnen viel Anerkennung dafür, dass sie kreativ sind und Dinge ausprobieren”, sagte Lauren Lieberman, Geschäftsführer bei Barclays Consumer Practice, in der Bemühungen zur Wiederbelebung von Covergirl. Sie bemerkte auch die gedämpfte Wiederbelebung der Philosophie, die Hautpflege und die Bade- und Körperlinie, die ein großer Erfolg in den Aughts sowie die Sun Care Line Lancaster war. Mit dem Rücktritt von Jab Holdings 'langjähriger Vorsitzender Peter Harb im April wird neue Führung wahrscheinlich für ein neues Denken bereit sein. Wenn Coty versucht, Käufer von Gerichts zu nehmen, sind potenzielle Bieter schlank und würden wahrscheinlich in einige ausgewählte Kategorien fallen. bricht zusammen, wer interessiert sein könnte – und warum – unten. Die Kronjuwelen Prestige -Duft bleibt Cotys heißeste Eigenschaft. Es enthält langfristige Lizenzen für Chloé, Gucci, Hugo-Chef und Calvin Klein, einige der berühmtesten Modehäuser der Welt. Hugo -Chef wird als die größte Marke des Unternehmens angesehen, die rund 10 Prozent oder rund 585 Millionen US -Dollar in Höhe von rund 9 Prozent und 7 Prozent des Gesamtumsatzes des Unternehmens umfasst. Dies sind wünschenswerte Vermögenswerte, selbst mit intensiver Konkurrenz durch Inseln auf dem Weg. Diese Düfte des Modehaus sind weit verbreitet, bekannt und haben ein integriertes Prestige und Dynamik. Ein Spezialist für Duftlizenzspezialist wie Interphlum, das für Lacoste und Anna Sui Parfums herstellt, könnte theoretisch interessiert sein. Seit 2022 hat es DKNY wiederbelebt und die Linie neu anspricht, nachdem LVMH sie an die G-III-Gruppe, ein Modeportfoliounternehmen, abgeladen hatte. Das spanische Konglomerat Puig könnte auch ein Anwärter sein; Während es sein Vertrauen in die Lizenzierung verringert hat und sich stattdessen auf den Besitz von Marken verändert hat, nachdem sie Byredo und Charlotte Tilbury aufgenommen haben, verwaltet es geschickt ähnliche Modehaus-Duftmarken wie Carolina Herrera und Jean-Paul Gaultier und könnte dazu beitragen, dass die Marken frische Energie injizieren könnten. Mode -Lizenzunternehmen wie Tapestry, PVH Corp oder Capri könnten auch daran interessiert sein, ihre Bestände zu diversifizieren und dem Mix Schönheit zu verleihen, insbesondere für bewährte Linien wie Burberry und Calvin Klein, von denen letztere das Modegeschäft besitzt. Der Luxusmarken ' Mutterunternehmen möchten möglicherweise auch ihre Schönheitsangebote wieder in Haus bringen. Der Gucci-Besitzer Kering hat kein Geheimnis aus seinen lauwartigen Gefühlen gegenüber der Gucci-Schönheitsmarke unter Cotys Besitz, die 2028 abläuft, kein Geheimnis gemacht, und Kering hat jetzt eine interne Schönheitsabteilung mit Creed. LVMH, dem Marc Jacobs gehört, hat sich als Expertise in Beauty bewährt und Schönheitsangebote wie Dior und Guerlain verwaltet. „Die Tatsache, dass Coty gedauert hat [as a company] So lange ist, weil Duft ein so großartiges Geschäft ist “, sagte Lieberman. In jüngerer Zeit beginnen Unternehmen wie LVMH und KERING ihre eigenen Schönheitswaffen oder konsolidieren ihre Bemühungen auf andere Weise. Lieberman sagte, andere Firmen wie Puig oder Fashion Lizenzierhäuser könnten alle logische Bieter sein, aber das Reiben ist, dass Cotys Fähigkeit, diese Lizenzen zu verkaufen, nicht eindeutig ist. Abhängig von der Art der unterzeichneten ursprünglichen Vereinbarungen können sie möglicherweise das Eigentum an ein neues Unternehmen übertragen. Massenbeschwerde Cotys Sortiment an Massenmarken wie Rimmel und Covergirl hat eine Namenserkennung, aber das Wachstum hat stagniert, da sie Marktanteile an schneller bewegende Indies wie Elf Beauty und Kiko Milano abgeschlossen haben. Sally Hansen ist laut Nielsen-IQ-Daten die größte Massennagelmarke der USA mit einem Marktanteil von 38 Prozent, obwohl der Umsatz auch gesunken ist, da die Verbraucher länger anhaltende Behandlungen priorisieren. Während die Massenmarken von Coty oft unter den Top 10 rangieren, ist der Drogeriekanal in den USA insgesamt weniger lukrativ geworden, da die Auswahl der Marken und im Geschäftserfahrung nicht mit Amazon und zunehmend Tiktok-Shop konkurrieren. Es ist unwahrscheinlich, dass ein strategischer Käufer eine so durchdrungene Marke mit niedrigem Wachstumskaderraum übernehmen möchte, aber Private Equity könnte für die Herausforderung stehen, insbesondere wenn er internationale Möglichkeiten für die Marken sieht. Solche Carve-Outs sind nicht ungewöhnlich in der Schönheit, sondern konzentrieren sich häufig auf Prestige-Marken: Private Equity Firm Advent Creecting im Jahr 2022, um Bareminerals, Buxom und Laura Mercier von Shiseido zu kaufen, während Coty einige seiner professionellen Marken, einschließlich Wella Company, im Jahr 2020 zum Private Equity-Unternehmen KKR abfuhr. Coty besitzt auch einige in Brasilien ansässige Körperpflege -Linien wie Bozzano, Monange, Paixao und Risiken, was für einen inländischen Spieler wie den früheren Aesop und Avon -Besitzer Natura mit seinem Heimatvorteil von Interesse sein könnte. Unabhängig davon, welcher Weg es weitergibt, ist eine Neukalibrierung wahrscheinlich bei Coty erforderlich. Und Käufer achten Sie auf-selbst die bekanntesten Marken von Beauty kämpfen darum, ein sinnvolles Wachstum in einer so wettbewerbsfähigen Landschaft zu erzielen. “[Coty's] Marken sollten relevant sein, aber es ist draußen überfüllt “, sagte Lieberman.

mov_8EA814FCEC62EE4CAB5C1C286AE610F2,2025-07-07 10:00:00,en,WEB,"  A report from the Business & Human Rights Resource Centre has called out many major fashion brands for their harmful labor practices. What's happening? Al Jazeera stated that the report, titled The Missing Thread, looked at 65 global fashion brands. Forty-four of them had previously pledged to reduce carbon emissions, but none of them created a ""just transition"" policy. Just transition policies aim to protect workers while companies shift to cleaner energy. Of the 65 analyzed, only two companies are doing anything to protect their workers. One was Inditex, which owns Zara, and the other was Gucci's parent company, Kering. Companies that have the least worker protections in conjunction with environmental policies include Hermes, Nike, and H&M. Why should the fast-fashion industry change its ways? The BHRRC is calling for major fashion brands to respect the people who work for them. Otherwise, their environmental policies are greenwashing . As Natalie Swan, BHRRC's labour rights programme manager, said in a news release: ""The fashion industry's climate targets mean little if the people who make its products are not taken into consideration. It's not enough to go green. It has to be clean and fair."" Watch now: How bad is a gas stove for your home's indoor air quality? The United Nations Development Programme says that the concept of a just transition was first discussed in the 1980s. U.S. trade unions embraced it so workers weren't left behind when new pollution regulations took effect. Just transitions value the public and local solutions. They also strive to create green jobs with living wages and health benefits. Fast-fashion companies notoriously mistreat their workers, but a just transition could reverse some of the damage. If companies do this effectively, they could drastically reduce the dirty energy they use and the textile waste they produce every year. What's being done about the lack of worker protections? ""Decarbonisation strategies, done right, protect workers and communities, reduce long-term risk and lay the foundation for stronger, fairer, and more resilient supply chains,"" Swan said in BHRRC's news release. What should the government do about the fast fashion industry? Set strict regulations Incentivize sustainable options Use both regulations and incentives Nothing Click your choice to see results and speak your mind. Reports like The Missing Thread are pressuring fast-fashion companies to do better. If we keep the pressure up, it's more likely that companies will change their ways. In the meantime, breaking up with fast fashion can help. Minimizing what you consume can also be an effective action to take. After all, there's a reason why ""reduce"" comes first in ""reduce, reuse , recycle.""

mov_56976A01C370911F92864B9515BA860A,2025-07-07 10:30:00,en,WEB,"  Five questions with Deseri Kelley, whose “little pieces of confidence” are a status symbol in a once-stuffy city trying to change its stripes. Dallas native Deseri Kelley is a good ambassador for her brand: Fashionable, savvy and Hollywood beautiful. The former teacher at Mesquite ISD, with roots in Trinidad and Tobago, is now an entrepreneur with a line of finely crafted handbags. In 2024, when her Deseri shop opened at the Galleria, Kelley became the first Black woman with her own designer store in the mall's history. Her distinctive purses and clutches have names like Diva and Paris and Halo (a 2008 Beyonce song), with pricetags mostly ranging in the mid-hundreds, a relatively low cost for designer bags. A Birkin, for instance, starts at $9,000. Kelley is married to former lawyer Kevin Kelley, the man behind Kitchen + Kocktails, a posh downtown spot with locations in Chicago and Washington, D.C. When the couple moved their sons to Europe for a few years to nurture the boys' soccer careers, Kelley learned about meticulous bags crafted in Spain and carried by Americans, and later she enlisted some of those artisans to make her Texas-based line, distinguished by its double-D logo and the gold head of a fox, a fitting insignia for a woman who has proven very cunning, indeed. How do you describe Dallas to people who don't live here? A perfect blend of big city and small-town charm. Dallasites make big moves, whether it's business, fashion or music. But it's also super-friendly and down-to-earth. What bothers you about Dallas? I wish Dallas were a little more inclusive. We're growing so fast, but there's still some work to do to make everyone feel like they belong and get a seat at the table. You became obsessed with handbags at 9. Why does such a small accessory mean so much? Handbags are more than just accessories. They're like a little piece of confidence you carry around. They tell a story, boost your vibe and when you have the right one, it makes you feel unstoppable. Our city is very brand-conscious. Chanel, Dior, Gucci, Hermes — as long as a label is popular, Dallas women will carry the handbag. Is it possible to give Dallas women permission to be trend-setters instead of trend-followers? Dallas women have tremendous potential to lead and set trends rather than follow them. It's about encouraging confidence in individual style and celebrating authenticity over brand hype. I think it's about embracing what feels authentic and making your look your own. Will you join me in asking the fine women of Dallas to stop carrying those dang Louis Vuitton purses? I've been seeing those brown leather buckets for, like, 40 years! Absolutely! While Louis Vuitton is a classic heritage brand, I do believe Dallas women should be carrying a Deseri handbag instead."

mov_0C9438023F5F38D449928465AE75F257,2025-07-07 11:06:21,en,WEB,"  After 10 years at Balenciaga, provocative Georgian showman Demna is to take a final bow during Paris Haute Couture Week, which began on Monday with a star-studded show by Schiaparelli. Demna, known for his daring work as well as controversies during his decade-long stint at Kering-owned Balenciaga, will unveil his final collection on Wednesday in what is expected to be one of the highlights of the week. The 44-year-old, acclaimed by millennials and Gen-Z stars from Kim Kardashian to British pop sensation Charli XCX, has been tasked with reviving the flagging fortunes of Gucci by Kering CEO Francois-Henri Pinault. Another of his biggest fans, rapper Cardi B, turned up at Schiaparelli on Monday in a traffic-stopping tasslled neckpiece and posed with a crow in the drizzle in front of the Petit Palais exhibition space. She took her seat on the front row alongside singer Dua Lipa, who wore a full-length petalled white outfit with daring cutaways. The Schiaparelli collection featured an impressive black-and-white ruffled gown, long sculptural evening dresses and refined tailored suits in a palette dominated by white, black and silver, with accents of bright red. Haute Couture Week is dedicated to handcrafted, one-of-a-kind creations made to wear at red carpets, galas and other high-profile events. Schiaparelli was followed by a show by Dutch designer Iris Van Herpen, who said her creations were inspired by the ocean and British documentary maker David Attenborough's heart-rending new film on sealife. Georges Hobeika, Imane Ayissi, Rahul Mishra, Julie de Libran and Giambattista Valli were set to follow later in the day. American Michael Rider, who succeeded Hedi Slimane as chief designer at Celine, unveiled his first collection for the luxury French brand on Sunday, outside the official calendar. – Absences – After Demna's farewell on Wednesday, Belgian designer Glenn Martens will find himself in the spotlight when he unveils a first collection for Maison Margiela, following his appointment in January to succeed British designer John Galliano. On Tuesday, Chanel will present the final collection created by its in-house design studio, the fifth since Virginie Viard's sudden departure in June 2024. Her successor, the discreet and highly respected Franco-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy, was appointed in December and will showcase his first collection for Chanel in October. In total, 27 houses will unveil their creations, including Elie Saab, Armani Prive, Aelis, Viktor&Rolf, Adeline Andre and Dubai-based Rami Al Ali, who is set to become the first Syrian to join the official Paris calendar. Following a spate of major changes at fashion houses, some absences will stand out, particularly Dior's. After a highly anticipated debut during the men's Fashion Week on June 27, newly appointed artistic director Jonathan Anderson is holding back his first haute couture collection for January 2026. Named in early June to lead Dior's women's and couture lines as well, the 40-year-old Northern Irishman has become the first person since founder Christian Dior himself to oversee all three branches of the house. Jean Paul Gaultier is also missing. Dutch designer Duran Lantink, appointed as the brand's permanent artistic director in April, will make his debut during Women's Fashion Week in October. Since stepping back in 2020, Jean Paul Gaultier has handed over the reins of his couture collections to a series of guest designers, including Olivier Rousteing, Ludovic de Saint Sernin, Haider Ackermann and Simone Rocha. The week will wrap up with a show by Swiss designer Kevin Germanier. mdv-adp/gil"

n1sf4vc,2025-07-07 11:17:40,en,REDDIT,"  All the things in all the comments are right. And it's cultural. We don't care about having the newest plastic wrapped shit from China. We prefer and take pride in repurposing old things. We care about the environment a lot more than a lot of people. We enjoy the outdoors and think about the impact buying new things has on the planet. I don't need a Gucci purse or the latest “on-trend” do-dad. My neighbors built their own outdoor brick pizza oven, they didn't buy a shiny stainless steel $1,000 one. I live in a village area and we all garden. It's a source of pride to make and trade goods. I make a lot of stuff, including furniture, wall coverings, etc from old wood and driftwood I find by the river steps from my house. I LOVE a good dump or side of the road find. My home is much more unique because it's full of unique furniture and art that didn't just roll off the assembly line and is off-gassing any manner of toxic chemicals used in its production. While at the dog park, I met a designer for Wayfair. The subject of using AI to render came up. When we asked him if he uses it in his work, he responded “sometimes I do, but I try to be mindful of the computing resources being used and their environmental impact”. That right there was the most Maine answer you'd find to a question about using AI. It speaks to the spirit we all have of considering our greater impact on the planet and to others. It is woven into the fabric of our lives and the community. And it is why we would rather celebrate a great dump or thrift store sweater, than a brand new one."

Find out the answer to this and other questions about recent antitrust activity in the #fashion and #luxury industries on this week's episode of the AmericanBarAssociation Antitrust Law Section's Our_Curious_Amalgam podcast, on which I had the privilege of being interviewed by Jeny Maier and Puja Patel. What happens when antitrust law meets high fashion? In episode 333, experienced fashion and luxury industry counsel Andowah Newton, joins Jeny Maier of Axinn, Veltrop & Harkrider and Puja Patel of ClearyGottlieb to unpack recent antitrust cases in the luxury and fashion industries. From the #FTC's challenge to Tapestry's (Coach katespadeny StuartWeitzman) attempted $8.5B acquisition of Caprii_Holdings (MichaelKors JimmyChoo Versace), to… ""No-poach"" & “no-hire” claims against Saks, BrunelloCucinelli_brand, Gucci, LoroPiana, LouisVuitton, and Prada), to… ""Tying"" claims against Hermès and its coveted #Birkin bag, we explore how #competition law is colliding with market definition, exclusivity, #branding, and status. Listen in for insights on how antitrust enforcers—and the courts—are approaching consolidation, labor & employment practices, and sales tactics in industries where scarcity sells.

Ascot may have its hats, the Serpentine Summer Party has its art world edge, and the Cartier Polo has its glamour, but there's a realness amongst the tennis-lovers flocking to SW19 that makes it genuinely inspiring for how to dress smartly in summer, come rain or shine.

mov_A05AD7D9D72C8D54ACAA29125D2938B6,2025-07-07 16:20:07,en,WEB,"  Digital Clothing Market WILMINGTON, DE, UNITED STATES, July 7, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- According to the report published by Allied Market Research, .

If you have any questions, Please feel free to contact our analyst at: https://www.alliedmarketresearch.com/connect-to-analyst/A31864 Based on region, North America was the largest market in 2021, capturing nearly two-fifths of the global digital clothing market share and likely to lead in terms of revenue in 2031. Digital clothing continues to fuel business revenue growth in North America, due to growth in the metaverse, virtual reality, and augmented reality technology in the region. Rise in investments in non-fungible assets (NFT) and digital penetration also drive the growth of digital clothing in this region. However, the market in Asia-Pacific is expected to manifest the fastest CAGR of 27.84% during the forecast period. This is due to rapid urbanization and an increase in digital content creation and acceptance in the region. Based on transaction, the on chain segment held the largest market share of three-fourths of the global digital clothing market in 2021 and is expected to maintain its dominance during the forecast period. The same segment is projected to witness the largest CAGR of 27.09% from 2022 to 2031. The growth of the segment is owed to its benefit of saving time and money of businesses by expediting the transaction process. The segment is expected to develop exponentially along with the increase in usage of blockchain technology. Based on application area, the digital content creation segment held the largest market share of nearly two-fifths of the global digital clothing market in 2021 and is expected to maintain its dominance during the forecast period. The same segment is projected to witness the largest CAGR of 28.9% from 2022 to 2031.

Het nadeel? Een aanprijzing voor rollators kwam ook bij jonge gezinnen terecht. Onnodige kosten, die tegenwoordig grotendeels worden vermeden. Er wordt nu vooral online geadverteerd, en daarin speelt AI een grote rol, vooral op het gebied van data-analyse. Door grote hoeveelheden gegevens te analyseren kan AI het juiste publiek voor advertenties selecteren. Daardoor komt de advertentie alleen terecht bij potentiële kopers. Dat maakt adverteren een stuk doeltreffender en bovendien goedkoper. Wat betekent AI voor jou als internetgebruiker? AI zal enorme hoeveelheden gegevens over jou analyseren. Je laat immers heel wat sporen achter op bijvoorbeeld Google of Facebook. Denk daarbij aan je zoekgeschiedenis, je klik- en koopgedrag en je activiteiten op social media. Aan de hand hiervan weet AI goed wie je bent en wat je leuk vindt. Op basis van deze voorkeuren bepaalt AI welke advertenties je te zien krijgt en wanneer. Iemand die op Google heeft gezocht op gokkasten, zal andere advertenties te zien krijgen dan iemand die de website van een tuincentrum heeft bezocht. AI en privacybescherming Het gaat zelfs nog verder. Twee mensen kunnen dezelfde advertentie zien, maar dan een versie die speciaal voor hen gemaakt lijkt. Een simpel en bekend voorbeeld is het 'Nu ook in Alkmaar', dat een inwoner van de Kaasstad onder een reclame ziet verschijnen. Ook het surfgedrag bepaalt de tekst bij een aanbieding. De een ziet bij een schoenenadvertentie de tekst 'Nu ook in maat 42', de ander 'Ideale schoenen voor lange wandelingen.' Het geeft veel mensen te denken dat zij bij elke handeling op internet gevolgd worden, meestal zonder dat ze het zelf door hebben. Er zijn wel nieuwe regels die jou als gebruiker moeten beschermen, maar de vraag is in hoeverre dat lukt. Vaak loopt de technologie vooruit op mogelijke regelgeving. Gebruikers kunnen wel maatregelen treffen door een VPN te gebruiken, incognito te surfen, cookies zoveel mogelijk te weigeren en een browser als Firefox of Brave te gebruiken, die tracking blokkeren. Maakt AI straks reclamebureaus overbodig? Vorige maand maakte Meta (eigenaar van Facebook, Instagram en WhatsApp) bekend dat merken volgend jaar geen reclamebureau meer nodig zouden hebben voor hun advertenties. Eind 2026 kunnen bedrijven op Instagram en Facebook advertenties volledig met AI ontwikkelen. De adverteerder geeft alleen doel en budget op, en AI doet de rest. Met behulp van tools als Google's Veo 3 en Runway kunnen teksten, afbeeldingen en video's worden gegenereerd. Hoewel Meta deze uitspraken later nuanceerde, leidden ze op Wall Street meteen tot flinke koersdalingen van bedrijven die de markt voor online advertenties domineren. Hoewel de koersen zich na enkele dagen herstelden, werd wel duidelijk dat de boodschap voor flink wat paniek zorgde. Veranderingen in de advertentiemarkt Is het einde in zicht voor tekst- en reclamebureaus? Volgens kenners hoeft dat niet het geval te zijn. Voor kleine bedrijfjes met weinig budget kunnen AI-campagnes een uitkomst zijn. Grote adverteerders zullen minder snel vertrouwen op algoritmes. AI kan misschien een visual of video maken, maar het idee om een unieke campagne te ontwikkelen lijkt vergezocht. Een groot merk zal niet het risico willen lopen dat advertentiecampagnes te veel op elkaar gaan lijken en de unieke merkbeleving schade oploopt. Toch kan dit in de toekomst veranderen, vooral als de AI-tools nog geavanceerder worden. Zeker in tijden van bezuinigingen kan dan de keuze voor AI worden gemaakt. Zo gebruikte Gucci, na slechte resultaten op de Aziatische markt, begin 2025 een volledig met AI gemaakte campagne om de nieuwe collectie te promoten. In elk geval zal de advertentiewereld zich snel moeten aanpassen aan de markt. Vooral de manier waarop zij betaald worden, zal veranderen. Facturen op basis van de gemaakte uren zullen volledig verdwijnen, en volledig gekoppeld worden aan de behaalde resultaten – een manier die al steeds meer wordt toegepast, maar volledig zal moeten worden geïmplementeerd. Daarnaast zal een advertentieafdeling geen grote teams meer nodig hebben. Een klein team van een paar uitstekende mensen met een visie zou genoeg zijn. De advertentiebedrijven zitten ook niet stil...."

Credit: Bradley Cooper said he ""fell in love"" with Anne Hathaway and her husband Adam Shulman during the Covid-19 pandemic, when their families would spend time together. Cooper also praised Hathaway for being kind to ""everyone,"" ""viciously intelligent,"" and having an admirable marriage. Hathaway's makeup artist Gucci Westman also gushed that the actress is kind-hearted. What's not to love about Anne Hathaway? The glamorous red carpet style, megawatt smile, incredible acting range, poise, and grace—the list goes on. She is Hollywood royalty (our Princess of Genovia, if you will), and not only does she boast 36.1 million adoring Instagram followers to prove it, but she has some of the biggest A-listers singing her praises. Anne Hathaway attends 'The Idea of You' New York premiere on April 29, 2024, in New York City. In the latest iteration of celebrities you had no idea were friends, Hathaway and American heartthrob Bradley Cooper formed quite an enviable friend group during the Covid-19 lockdown. The two Manhattan-based actors spent lots of time together with their families during the pandemic, and their bond made it out of social distancing. “You see how she treats everyone—and it's everyone—she's so kind,” the American Sniper star told Vogue for Hathaway's August cover story. “We started hanging out as parents, having dance parties with children in my kitchen, and I fell in love with both of them,” he continued, referring to Hathaway and her husband of a 12 years, Adam Shulman. The couple also shares two sons, Jonathan and Jack. Bradley Cooper and Anne Hathaway attend the National Board Of Review 2024 Awards Gala on January 11, 2024, in New York City. Not only did Hathaway herself capture Cooper, but her marriage did as well. Cooper described their coupling as “an emblem for that kind of commitment,” adding that they “enrich” each other. “You've met Anne: She's very present and grounded, I'll put it that way. And kind,” Cooper concluded. “She's viciously intelligent.” Anne Hathaway and Adam Shulman at the Cannes Film Festival on May 19, 2022, in Cannes, France. The world is well aware that Hathaway is wickedly talented, but she is also reportedly stunningly and genuinely nice, despite her fame. The Interstellar star's makeup artist Gucci Westman echoed Cooper's sentiment. “She doesn't gossip. It just doesn't occur to her to be catty—and then you don't want to be catty around her,"" Westman said. "" She's funny, she's curious—that's the main word I'd use to describe her. I just mean she looks for the good in people.” Hathaway and her husband, Shulman, first crossed paths at the Palm Springs Film Festival in 2008 and things quickly turned romantic. They made their red carpet debut in 2009 and became engaged in November 2011. They tied the knot in Big Sur, California, in September 2012 and went on to welcome their first son, Jonathan, in 2016, followed by their second son, Jack, in 2019."

n1u5123,2025-07-07 16:58:49,en,REDDIT,"  His story is also perfect movie material because there's so much foreshadowing and callbacks and unexpected twists. Like how he took a photo with a fake award at a MAMA popup store the year before and then ended up opening mama the next year Or how he used to play at weddings and venues with his one gucci belt and black pants and then he did an ad for Gucci and wore the same belt on his way there. And not to mention he has such a compelling villain that is hilariously terrible at their job. MNET being racist actually worked against them by inflating the expected votes of the Korean trainees and the Japanese trainee they were willing to give screentime to. The way that mnet underplayed his accomplishments  actually helped him fly under the radar as a major threat to 1st until the very last week. The way  MNET was so sure of who will win the third round they made the rewards exclusive (previously all teams got those benefits), but then zhang hao managed to lead his team of four foreigners with the second-to-last ranked team  against a team with the top four ranked trainees. The fact that a popular theory for why mnet couldn't show interim results in the finals to lower Zhang hao's votes was  because mnet  was basically caught between having another Chinese-filipino-american getting in the group over their second most popular Korean trainee, or a Chinese center. And stuff like the committee that sent the last director to jail swooped in right before finals with a warning to mnet because mnet was suspected of rigging a non-voting segment against SE Asian trainees and was planning to use the same method to determine final song center. There's just so much plot worthy material hidden behind the actual show."

With only a few red carpet appearances over the years, fans have always loved getting updates on them whenever they can. And, in her latest cover for Vogue, fellow actor Bradley Cooper is doing just that. According to the outlet, Cooper bonded with Hathaway and Shulman, who have been married since 2012, during the COVID-19 pandemic when they joined “one of the world's most glamorous COVID pods” in New York City. “We started hanging out as parents, having dance parties with children in my kitchen, and I fell in love with both of them,” the A Star Is Born star remembered.

She's viciously intelligent.” Cooper wasn't the only close friend of Hathaway to gush over the actress in the feature. “She doesn't gossip,” revealed her makeup artist, Gucci Westman. “It just doesn't occur to her to be catty—and then you don't want to be catty around her.” “I don't want to give the impression she's not fun to hang out with,” he then added. “She's funny, she's curious—that's the main word I'd use to describe her.

How do i fix this? First problem: i have this close person (let's call them Z). Z often explains me as a person with autism. Which i hate! Z would say things like ""yeah but he can't help it. He is like that. His autism is this and it does that."" No offense. I'm happy z is trying to show she acknowledges my autism and things i do but....DON'T SAY SHIT THAT ISN'T TRUE!!!! i don't want to confront z cus i like her. I'm scared that i might hurt her some way. But it hurts she assumes this and then accepts it. Cus she thinks it's like that. She also always ALWAYS says she knows me better than i know myself. ""You should see yourself. If i filmed you. you would think the same."" Second problem: i can't stop going over every damn detail. With work, talking, homework and just overall everything. When i do homework and my teacher says ""give me a clothing company name."" I would literally go search a company and look at the start of it of how it was made, the products and memorize it, the maker and more. And then blabber about ""so the company i choice is gucci it was created in. The founder was and they mostly make with a new line of this that and this."" I am not joking. LITERALLY! when someone in my family asks where the remote is i say ""in the living room near the brown long closet by the tv in the 3rd drawer under the documents of dads company."" And when i do work and someone says ""just paste this ticket on the phone"" ""how should i paste it? Upside down, left corner, right under the logo or how should i do it? Should i paste it a bit off the side so we can rip it off later easily?"" I know i am annoying but these things happen like autopilot. Third problem: i always feel like people already assume what i can and can't do because of my autism. Ones my teacher went to me and said ""i don't see you work as a seller. You should choose something different. Where you work as a factory worker. I don't see you able to handle confrontation."" I gasped inside. I was so shook. And i felt literally something break inside me. Or something sting. That hurt so much. I just nodded and said ""okay"" because my mind was blank. I couldn'r think of anyting to say back. But what i did was when we were suppose to choose our place to work internship. And we had to make lists of places we wanted to choose. I purposely only choose seller internships. And i said ""if i can't find any of these i won't do any internship."" First time i ever talked back...."

STORY LAST UPDATED TUESDAY 8th JULY 00:00AM. Your Amazon Prime Day perfume deals FAQs, answered: When is Amazon Prime Day? What is Amazon Prime Day? How can I take part in Amazon Prime Day 2025? How we choose the best Amazon Prime Day fragrance deals The best Amazon Prime Day fragrances, reviewed How we choose the best Amazon Prime Day fragrance deals As a commerce writer for GLAMOUR, I spend an unreasonable amount of time scrolling through new fragrance launches, sifting through price drops, and mentally categorising every scent I spritz. So when it comes to Prime Day, I'm only interested in sharing the deals that are actually worth your attention. GLAMOUR's Sophie Cockett testing perfumes ahead of Amazon Prime Day. I've handpicked these perfume offers based on a few non-negotiables: genuine savings, cult-status bottles, and scents I'd happily recommend to a friend or wear myself. Some are timeless bestsellers (hello, Daisy Marc Jacobs), others are underrated gems that deserve more air time. I've also kept different tastes and budgets in mind, from delicate florals to deep musks, lightweight body mists to full-bodied parfums. Whether you're loyal to a signature scent or on the hunt for something new, these are the deals I'd bookmark, spritz, and stock up on. Ahead, the top Amazon Prime Day perfume deals of 2025… 1/21 Best Daisy fragrance Daisy Marc Jacobs EDT 50ml Why we love it: If you're looking for a fresh and feminine fragrance, look no further than the cult-favourite classic that is Daisy By Marc Jacobs.

The best part? It's just been reduced, courtesy of Amazon Prime Day. Even years after its initial release date, Ari's perfume is still a best-seller that we know and love. Our very own writer and expert on all things perfume associates the fragrance with ""warm, slightly undercooked, doughy waffles.” An absolute must-buy. 3/21 Best YSL fragrance Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium Eau de Parfum Why we love it: We're so lucky that this iconic fragrance from YSL always seems to find its way to an Amazon discount. Thanks to notes of coffee and sensual vanilla, it's captivating and energetic, which makes for a night out on the town. 4/21 Best luxury fragrance..."

mov_4BE02EC1D02780795018AB8F8DF7AECB,2025-07-08 01:00:00,en,WEB,"  Saks Global is going through some growing pains. The parent company of Saks Fifth Avenue bought Neiman Marcus in a $2.7 billion acquisition last year, bringing both department-store behemoths under the same umbrella (along with Bergdorf Goodman). And though the move was meant to unite the luxury titans, the brands have run into some trouble: Consumers are opting to shop at other high-end retailers instead, such as Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom, Bloomberg reported. More from Robb Report Saks Fifth Ave. saw its sales drop 16 percent year-over-year from the quarter ending June 30, while Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf's combined sales fell 10 percent in the same time period, according to Bloomberg's Second Measure, a spending index that tracks consumers' debit- and credit-card use. June also marked the largest sales drop across the three department stores, according to the data, with Saks seeing a 28 percent decrease in sales and Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf declining by 26 percent. Over at Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom, meanwhile, sales rose over 10 percent at both retailers during the same period. In June specifically, Bloomingdale's sales increased by 13 percent, the Second Measure data says. Bloomberg's spending index does have some limits, though. It tracks more debit purchases that credit card transactions; as a result, the info doesn't paint a complete picture of sales at the retailers, since consumers Saks, Neiman Marcus, and Bergdorf use credit cards more frequently compared to other customers, while Bloomingdale's and Nordstrom shoppers often opt for debit cards. Even so, Second Measure is helpful in tracking trends across different retailers. Part of the reason for Saks Global's troubles, in addition to general economic uncertainty, is an increase in order complaints since January, such as damaged packaging and rejected refunds, according to Mary Ross Gilbert, a Bloomberg analyst that studied customer reviews. This has led consumers to look elsewhere for their luxury goods. On top of that, the conglomerate is dealing with some financial woes, recently taking on more debt, in part, to pay off its overdue bills from vendors, who have slowed or even stopped shipments over fears of a lack of payment, Bloomberg reported. Saks isn't alone in its struggles. A trend of declining sales has been popping up across the luxury industry, thanks to looming tariffs in the U.S. and weakened demand in China, among other challenges. LVMH, for one, was below its estimated sales for Q1 this year, Reuters reported, while Gucci saw its sales drop 25 percent in the first three months of 2025, according to Vogue Business. This year's figures come on top of declining numbers at the end of 2024, with Kering (Gucci's parent company), seeing a year-over-year drop of 12 percent. As for Saks Global, things may be on the up and up. For one, the brand's new Amazon.com storefront has been met positively, a spokesperson for the company told Bloomberg. And shipments from vendors are increasing, too, in the wake of new financing, something that Saks says will “continue as we execute on our plan to begin paying outstanding balances in July,” the spokesperson told the publication. Making those vendors happy will be a key step to putting the retailer back on the right track. Sign up for RobbReports's Newsletter.

简单举个例子：
1⃣️有人花50雇人全网收集养殖类虚拟资料，他只负责整合成电子书，单价158，半年销量超2万。 2⃣️ChatGPT诞生的一段时间，有人调用其API，搭建国内版GPT，按199卖会员，销量已过4万。 3⃣️有人利用Stable Diffusion生成大量图片，然后把图片放到图库网站去卖，成本仅仅是一台电脑。 4⃣️有人订阅了国外的期刊和资讯，翻译成中文，转手拿到小红书上卖，98，三个月卖出1万份。 5.有人在小红书卖jian霏食谱，文案从微博抄，配图直接搬运ins健身博主。 啥都不用自己弄，一个月狂卖8000份！ 一份卖9.9，纯利润都快8万了！ 有人下单就去🍑几块钱买电子版，转手就发，连打字都省了！ 6.有人天天蹲日本中古网站，看到成色好的二手da排包包就下单。 花3000块淘了个Gucci老花包，国内某鱼挂8000，一周就卖出去了！ 买家还以为捡到漏，其实他连包都没摸过，直接让日本卖家寄给客户！ 小红书上卖PPT模板。 拼xixi5块钱买1000套模板，自己挑几套好看的做个合集，标价39.9一份。 天天发“打工人必备”笔记，评论区全是求链接的，一个月净赚3万多！ 搞钱就是卖，就是当二道贩子，但是就是这样简单的事很多人都不愿意动手去做，也看不上一些看起来很low的事情，永远听别人说xx太卷，xx没前途，xx太low不值💰
就拿我自己来说，靠倒买倒卖三个月时间赚到一辆保时捷的💰。 看看我具体是怎么操作的？ 前段时间饺子导演拍的哪吒2破百艺票房！ 看完热血沸腾，我就在里面嗅到商机，很多人也想成为像饺子这样的导演，做一部属于自己的三维动漫，他们不知道去哪里学。 我花830去国外网站买别人的三维动漫的教程，然后用deepseek吧里面的内容翻译成中文，后期在自己配音上去，就变成自己的了，直接在小红薯上开店挂链接卖1999，用国外买来的素材剪辑成视频发小红薯，根本不用担心流量，饺子🥟的哪吒2已经提前给你免费推流了，短短三个月就利润就过百w。 这社会赚钱就俩法子：卖自己的货，或者帮别人卖货。 对咱普通人来说，当二道贩子就是门槛zui抵的暴富捷径！ 接下来就是看你自己有多少执行力~

mov_CE2F19AE3A2627C5D41A0F912AB3C9BA,2025-07-08 04:00:27,en,WEB,"  It was, in the end, a fashion trend awaiting better weather. Now that summer is here, the “fisherman aesthetic”, long heralded as one of the key looks for 2025, has finally arrived. Or has it? Standing on the beach at Hastings, with a stiff wind blowing into my face, I am adding one layer of fishing gear on top of another while holding my fisherman's hat on my head, gently overheating under a hazy sky. I'm not sure this is what Vogue had in mind when it predicted that “the menswear customer will take to water, embracing the 'fisherman aesthetic'” earlier this year. I can't see anyone else on the beach embracing it. Then again, I can't see anyone else on the beach. These early predictions have now hardened into a mantra. “What started as a humble nod to weathered knit sweaters, sturdy boots and utilitarian outerwear has turned into a full-fledged movement,” declared lifestyle website The Velvet Runway. “Practical gear like rainboots, work jackets and canvas totes abound,” said Cosmopolitan. “Less yacht club, more fishing dock,” said InStyle. By the end of March, Veranda magazine felt able to confirm that “the fisherman aesthetic now reigns supreme in both fashion and interior design”. However, when you investigate the origins of fisherman chic, it quickly becomes clear there are two main branches to the trend. The first is more of a general nautical vibe than a uniform: striped tops, baggy khakis, boat shoes, cable knits. The Daily Mail cited “the naval-inspired looks on the recent runways of Tommy Hilfiger, Ralph Lauren and Proenza Schouler” as sources for the trend, said to be an offshoot of the “coastal grandma” look (no, me neither) from a few years ago, which was largely confined to women's fashion. It's beach-friendly, casual and understated (Diane Keaton in the film Something's Gotta Give is apparently an inspiration for it). People dedicated to showing you how to get the look on TikTok are at pains to point out that you may well own most of the stuff already. The second strand, what might be termed the male version of fisherman chic, comes at it from another direction, specifically fly-fishing. New York menswear boutiques such as Blue in Green have been selling out of the multi-pocketed fishing vests favoured by anglers. According to the Washington Post, outfitters catering to fly-fishermen have recently seen revenue boosted by sales to men who don't fish, but are keen to adopt a look the paper dubbed “anglercore”. Where these traditional outfitters might once have been pleasantly bewildered by all the extra online traffic, the industry is catching on. Streetwear brands and angling companies have begun collaborating on outdoor clothing lines. Last autumn, the Canadian rapper Drake, through his Nike brand Nocta, produced an actual fly-fishing reel in collaboration with Abel Reels. Where the womenswear strand of fisherman chic seems to be more about inspiration – using a nautical theme as a jumping-off point – the menswear seems more like direct occupational appropriation – literally buying the stuff real fishermen use. As the stylist and fashion writer Peter Bevan sees it, the authenticity of the gear is the point of this angler aesthetic. “If, say, Gucci did a fishing jacket, and they bought that one, it's almost like them faking it,” he says. “When it comes to workwear, men just like to buy into the proper brands that do it and the real type of workwear, rather than anything that feels manufactured.” There is an inverted aesthetic at work: in most cases the clothing is purely functional; it has no style per se, only a kind of perceived integrity. The Japanese workwear brand Montbell uses the slogan “Function is beauty”, which is one way of saying: this stuff looks this way for a reason. Fly-fishing vests, for example, are often cropped weirdly short, but that's not a style – it's so the pockets don't get wet when you're standing up to your ribcage in a river. And they aren't covered in pockets because pockets are cool; it's because anglers need storage for all the kit they carry into the water. “You're using floats, you might use sinks, you've got spools of nylon,” says Mark Bowler, editor of Fly Fishing & Fly Tying magazine. “You've got a dry fly box, you've got a nymph box, you've got a lure box. You'll have scissors, forceps, nips. You've got numerous tools, almost medical, dangling off the waistcoat. You might have a hook retriever in there …” There is an obvious irony to this extreme functionality, in that few, if any, of the influencers wearing fly-fishing vests on the streets of Brooklyn will ever use the garment for its intended purpose, or even know what that is. “… You've got leaders, sight indicators, magnifiers, your sandwiches,” says Bowler. “You might have a water bottle in the back of it, because it's got pockets at the back. There might be scales in there for weighing fish, or tungsten putty.” On the beach in Hastings, I am having a certain amount of trouble rationalising the two branches of the fisherman aesthetic. My jacket would suit weather more foul than I'm likely to encounter all year. Meanwhile, the Schöffel fly-fishing shirt I'm wearing looks like something Nigel Farage might go canvassing in, only it's made of a lightweight, quick-drying polyester. Who knows? Maybe his is too. There is, of course, something immediately satisfying about wearing a technical garment; it bestows a certain sense of competence and expertise all by itself. The Wensum fly vest by Farlows – a British outfitter established in 1840 – has four capacious pockets on the front and a swatch of shearling wool just below the right shoulder which, it turns out, is for hanging your flies on. The Ayacucho Trailblazer vest has no fewer than 10 pockets, and also – somehow – repels mosquitoes. “Some include a life vest as well,” says Bowler. “So if you fall in, the waistcoat explodes.”..."

Featured pricing is subject to change. Nordstrom understands the beauty of a great deal. During the department store's much-awaited Anniversary Sale, hundreds of beauty sets are up for grabs — including exclusives from hardly-ever-on-sale luxury brands like La Mer, Augustinus Bader and Dr. Dennis Gross. Page Six's Picks While deals are already available for Nordstrom Icon cardholders, they open to the brand's Ambassador tier on July 9, followed by Influencers and the general public on July 10 and 12, respectively. Below, start shopping (or curating your wishlist) with our roundup of the best celebrity-approved beauty buys — but act fast, as the most popular products tend to sell out long before the sale ends on August 4. Nordstrom La Mer's products are famously pricey, but stars like Jennifer Lopez, Kate Hudson and Selena Gomez swear they're worth it. Right now, Nordstrom's offering a rare opportunity to bag the luxury line's signature Créme de La Mer for less, along with several other mini must-haves. Nordstrom Want to smell like a star? Sofia Richie and Meghan Markle have both cited this mineral, woody Jo Malone London blend as a signature scent. Nordstrom This bestselling formula does triple duty as makeup remover, cleanser and moisturizer. Equally multitasking stars like Bethenny Frankel rave about the stuff, now available in a jumbo value version exclusively at Nordstrom. “I am partial to the original one because it makes me feel like I'm in a botanical spa,” Frankel said on TikTok, naming it one of the “expensive” items she deems “worth it.” Nordstrom Emily Ratajkowski called these pre-packaged peels “the best for exfoliating your skin” in a recent W interview, admitting she'd skipped the skincare step before. “I've noticed a huge improvement in the texture and tonal quality of my skin,” she raved. Nordstrom If splurging doesn't scare you, there's also an unheard-of deal on a set featuring the brand's SpectraLite FaceWare Pro mask. (It's like getting peel pads, blurring cream and a lip treatment for free.) “I would die for it,” DeSorbo raved of the red- and blue light-powered mask in an Amazon Live. “I truly think it is one of the only LED masks I've ever used that actually works.” Pro tip: Sets like this have been among the first to sell out in previous years, so we'd recommend snapping this one up fast. Nordstrom From famous faces to Page Six staffers, plenty of beauty experts swear by NuFace. Tay Lautner told us the “super user-friendly” device is one of her “favorite things to use to help lift, plump and smooth [her] skin before an event,” while Kate Hudson raved about the brand to Mindbodygreen. “When I do the NuFace every day, I feel a huge difference in my skin,” she told the outlet. I was not expecting that because I always think those things feel gimmicky, but they really work.” Our very own managing editor, Alexandra D'Aluisio, is also a fan: “Nicola Coughlan used the NuFace Trinity+ in a Vogue “Beauty Secrets” video … she even insisted she knew when she 'went ham' on the product because her 'cheekbones were cheekboning' in certain scenes,” she says. “That was enough to convince me to buy, and I've been trying to use it at least three times a week ever since.” Nordstrom Sabrina Carpenter can do a lot with 15 minutes — but applying her signature blush will only take you a matter of seconds. The star's long worked with makeup artist Carolina Gonzalez, who told us she applies the blendable formula on the mid-apples of the pop phenom's cheeks. “When you start on the cheekbone and go up from there, it gives you more of a lifted and snatched look,” Gonzalez explained. Nordstrom Love the Longchamp Le Pliage totes stars and royals like Kate Middleton have carried? In addition to a full-size version, the sale also includes this adorable mini makeup bag. Nordstrom Plenty of superstars stock up on Supergoop! , from Brooke Shields and Jessica Chastain to Christie Brinkley. (The latter recently told us she swears by the brand's “easy formulas.”) Nordstrom The 411 on stars' favorite face masks? So many stars use 111Skin, it just might be easier to name A-listers who haven't raved about the brand. Sydney Sweeney, Lady Gaga, Bella Hadid, Jenna Lyons and Priyanka Chopra (to name but a few) have all been linked to the label's luxe skincare. Page Six Style & Shopping Editor Elana Fishman is also impressed with the products, saying of the rose gold mask included in this set, “I slapped on this mask the morning of a video shoot, hoping it'd help me look my best on camera — and boy, did it live up to the hype.” Nordstrom..."
mov_DDF6C3A5A1E054BF57D8010BE6885036,2025-07-08 05:00:49,en,WEB,"  Fiorucci Spring Summer 2026 backstage moments captured by Sohom Das for DSCENE   With a career spanning some of the most iconic names in Italian fashion, Versace, Giorgio Armani, Gucci, Givenchy, and Ferragamo, Francesca Murri has quietly shaped the visual language of contemporary luxury. In 2023, she took the creative helm at Fiorucci, the legendary Italian label founded in 1967 by Elio Fiorucci. Tasked with revitalizing a brand known for its irreverence and pop spirit, Murri has already presented four collections that pulse with energy, color, and optimism. Murri's approach to Fiorucci is equal parts reverence and reinvention. Drawing deeply from the house's rich archive, she reinterprets its iconic motifs—lips, angels, hearts, through a modern, playful lens. Her debut collection, unveiled at Milan Fashion Week in September 2023, set the tone for her tenure: a vibrant celebration of joy, freedom, and creativity, all rooted in Fiorucci's signature DNA. The upcoming “ Beatittudo ” FW25 collection continued this narrative, inspired by the pursuit of pure happiness and characterized by a bold palette that injects fresh energy into the brand. Under Francesca Murri, Fiorucci has become a platform for experimentation and dialogue, embracing collaborations with artists and emerging talents from across the creative spectrum. Her vision is about more than clothes; it's about fostering a community and spreading positive messages that resonate in today's world. By blending the brand's storied past with the needs and languages of modern society, Murri is ensuring Fiorucci's legacy remains as dynamic and relevant as ever. Below, Francesca Murri discusses with DSCENE's EIC Zarko Davinic her creative process, the role of Milan, the power of contrasts, and her hopes for Fiorucci's future post her Spring Summer 2026 runway show in Milan . Photo ©Sohom Das   What does it mean for you and Fiorucci to present your collections in Milano every season? How does the city's unique energy influence your creative process? – Milano is where Elio Fiorucci created everything and started dreaming. It's crucial for me to catch the spirit of the city and put it into a very international narrative. Influences come from everywhere in this place full of art. Piazza Fiorucci is described as a space where everyday reality and fantasy meet. How did you translate this concept into both the collection and the show's outdoor set design? – For the collection I asked Janina Zais to work body painting and hair spraying the models to inject the cartoonish approach into the products. I also take inspiration, for the red pois dress, from the Walt Disney character Minnie. For the set design I wanted to use banners that represented the sky and road signs on the ground with totally invented and fantastic elements such as the angel shooting the arrow. The collection is full of contrasts, urban yet dreamlike, tender yet sensual. How do you approach balancing these opposing elements in your designs? – I play very much with contrasts that are very crucial for the brand. When there's something basic I apply something unexpected in a very Fiorucci way. And also the contrast played through the association between products and faces is very important. Rock characters with chic products and the opposites work very well. Many pieces play with iconic Fiorucci motifs, like the lips, angels, and hearts, reimagined in playful, pop-art ways. What draws you to these symbols, and how do you keep them feeling fresh? – I always start by defining the key pillars of the brand and based on the seasonal concept I focus on the ones that help me to push forward the concept. This season the pop, cartoonish approach influenced my way to characterize them. The slogan “Make Hearts Beat Again” featured on accessories and tees is both affectionate and provocative. What message are you hoping to send with this phrase? – In these uncertain moments in which everyone is a bit scared, I wanted send out a positive message by inviting people to make hearts beat again. An ode to love! Photo ©Sohom Das   The collection uses a bold color palette and a mix of classic and innovative materials, from recycled PVC to Tyvek and glossy coatings. How do you decide which materials best express a new Fiorucci era? – We usually search for innovative materials and this is very important to express the feelings I am having at the beginning of the creative process. The unexpected approach to the usage of the materials can create uniqueness. In a time when the fashion industry faces economic challenges and a looming recession, what do you believe will help brands like Fiorucci stay resilient and relevant? – It's hard for the new projects to find a place in this tough and crowded market. I believe that Fiorucci can have a role in society by creating a platform for collaborations with emerging talents to generate very creative contents not only in fashion but also in art and music. Looking ahead, how do you see Fiorucci's identity evolving? What are your hopes for the brand, and for the industry? – I see the project more mature season after season. I hope the market will get better soon to have more opportunities to reach our targeted clients throughout pop ups and stores and give them more chances to experience the brand.

The Haute-Couture week begins in Paris on Monday and is again shaped by changes among the creative directors: inside. Schiaparelli traditionally opens the views. On the same day, the fashion shows of the houses Iris van Herpen – back after a year away – Georges Hobeika, Imane Ayissi, Rahul Mishra, Julie de Libran and Giambattista Valli. The highlight of this autumn/winter season 2025/26 is the farewell to Demna Gvasalia near Balenciaga. The 44-year-old Georgian designer presents his last collection for the French fashion house on Wednesday afternoon. After ten years at the top, the designer changes to the Italian luxury brand Gucci. Their weak performance is burdened by Kering's business, which both brands belong to. It is replaced by the Italian Pierpaolo Piccioli, who will present his first collection in October during the Paris Fashion Week. A farewell to a large tamam: In addition to an exhibition entitled “Balenciaga of Demna” in the Kering headquarters, the fashion house has been releasing the best looks on its Instagram account for a few days that the designer has designed in the past decade. On Wednesday evening, Glenn Martens also made his debut with Maison Margiela. In January he was appointed the successor to the British John Galliano. With this first fashion show, the Belgian designer marks the return of the French house to the skin-couture calendar. The last show under the Pont Alexandre III bridge in January 2024 was viewed by many as one of the most spectacular in recent years. The fashion houses Patou and Celine already showed their collections outside of the official calendar on Sunday. This served as an unofficial prelude to the haute couture week. Dior and Gaultier are missing On Tuesday, Chanel will be presenting a collection for the last time that was designed by the internal design studio. It has been the fifth collection since Virginie Viard's sudden departure in June 2024. The successor, the reserved and highly respected French-Belgian designer Matthieu Blazy, will present his first collection in October. By Thursday, 27 fashion houses will present their creations, including Elie Saab, Armani Privé, Aelis, Viktor & Rolf, Adeline André and the Syrian Couturier Rami Al Ali, who has been added to the official calendar. Due to the change of creative directors: there are also some remarkable absences here this week. Dior is not there. After a much-noticed first fashion show during the Men's Fashion Week on June 27, Jonathan Anderson rises his first haute couture collection for January 2026. The 40-year-old Nordire was called to the head of the women's and skin couture collections from Dior in early June and replaced Maria Grazia Chiuri. Just a few weeks earlier, he had taken responsibility for the men's collection. He has been the first since Christian Dior to lead all three lines of the LVMH flagship fashion house. Jean Paul Gaultier is also missing. The Dutchman, Dutch Duran Lantink, who was appointed in April in April, will make his debut during the Fashion Week in October. Since retirement in 2020, designer Jean Paul Gaultier has left guest designers' management of his Haute-Couture collections: inside like Olivier Rousteins, Ludovic de Saint Sernin, Haider Ackermann and Irin Simone Rocha. The event ends with the fashion show by the Swiss Kevin Germanier. Not to be confused with the Paris Fashion Week, the Haute-Couture week takes place in January for summer and July for winter. It takes place exclusively in Paris because it is a French peculiarity in which unique, handmade pieces are presented. These creations are mainly intended for red carpets, large jet set events and galas. This article was used with digital tools translated.

mov_0A540E31F0A3982A2935B549278C1571,2025-07-08 06:35:00,id,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[id]KRJOGJA.com - Sebuah studi yang diterbitkan pada 23 Juni 2025 oleh organisasi nonpemerintah Inggris Earthsight menyebut bahwa merek-merek fesyen mewah internasional membeli kulit dari perusahaan-perusahaan yang terkait dengan peternakan yang memelihara sapi di tanah adat dan di daerah-daerah yang ditebangi secara ilegal di Amazon. Melansir Brasil de Fato, Sabtu (5/7/2025), investigasi yang dilakukan dalam kemitraan dengan Repórter Brasil ini menganalisis keputusan pengadilan, citra satelit, dan catatan pengiriman. Laporan ini juga meneliti rantai pasar di sektor tersebut untuk mengungkap jaringan pasokan kulit dari merek-merek, seperti Chanel, Balenciaga, dan Gucci. Menurut Earthsight, perusahaan pengepakan daging Brasil Frigol berada di dasar rantai produksi ini. Rumah pemotongan hewan tersebut diidentifikasi sebagai pembeli sapi yang dipelihara di tanah yang diembargo karena penebangan hutan, serta dari peternakan yang didirikan secara ilegal di Tanah Adat Apyterewa di São Félix do Xingu, negara bagian Pará Baca Juga: PSIM Kenalkan Bek Asal Argentina Franco Ramos Mingo, Ini Rekam Kariernya Studi tersebut menunjukkan bahwa hampir semua kulit yang diekspor dari Pará ke Eropa ditujukan ke Italia. Sebagian dari produk ini dibeli Conceria Cristina dan Faeda, perusahaan penyamakan kulit dari Veneto, Italia, tempat bahan tersebut diproses dan diberi merek baru sebagai ""kulit Italia."" Perusahaan-perusahaan ini memasok lusinan merek fesyen, otomotif, dan desain interior mewah. Selain Chanel, Balenciaga, dan Gucci, Conceria Cristina memasok kulit yang diperoleh di Brasil ke merek mewah Amerika Serikat (AS), Coach, yang menargetkan Generasi Z dan menjual tas dengan harga antara 340─686 dolar AS (sekitar Rp5,5 juta─Rp11,1 juta), yang dianggap ""mudah dijangkau"" di pasar barang mewah. Hubungan komersial antara Coach dan Conceria Cristina dikonfirmasi pada peneliti Earthsight oleh juru bicara dari perusahaan penyamakan kulit Italia. Investigasi tersebut menyoroti Durlicouros, eksportir terbesar dari Pará ke Eropa, sebagai pemasok utama bagi perusahaan-perusahaan Italia. Baca Juga: Ahmad Luthfi Tegaskan Jangan Coba-coba Timbun Bahan Pokok Penting Menurut laporan ekspor yang dianalisis Earthsight, Durlicouros telah mengekspor 90 persen dari semua kulit yang diproduksi di Pará ke Italia dari 2020 hingga 2023, dengan total 14.700 ton. Durlicouros mengonfirmasi pada Earthsight bahwa mereka membeli kulit binatang dari Frigol."

攜手塗鴉鬼才Vexx推出經典C-Lite「日與夜」限量系列。 記者陳建興／台北報導
全球行李箱領導品牌 Samsonite 一直以創新精神顛覆想像，這一次，品牌大膽跨足街頭藝術，與比利時擁有超高知名度的當代塗鴉藝術家 Vexx 攜手，推出 C-Lite x Vexx限量聯名系列。 當經典行李箱遇上色彩爆發的Doodles創作，旅行不再只是從出發地到目的地，而是一場活潑奔放的藝術旅程。 此次超強聯名系列，以「日與夜」為靈感，為C-Lite標誌性的貝殼造型設計兩種截然不同卻彼此呼應的藝術圖騰，傳遞無懼界線的創作精神，其中「Daylight」日光款以潔白箱體為基底，結合 Vexx 標誌性的飽和色彩與童趣角色，如晨光中甦醒的想像，鮮明且充滿活力;「Nightfall」夜幕款則採深邃底色，結合神秘塗鴉圖騰，彷彿夜幕低垂後綻放的夢境星河，展現內斂卻不失大膽的藝術態度。 兩款設計既大膽又優雅，襯托出既前衛又符合品牌一貫高級感的精緻質感。 以「Day_&_Night」為靈感，創造完美呼應的藝術圖騰，為每一段冒險注入活潑色彩。 Samsonite作為追求細節的旅箱精品，聯名系列推出20吋及28吋行李箱，滿足各種旅程需求，內襯也承襲同樣的藝術設計，以低調、半透明的塗鴉印花呈現，從裡到外都注入驚喜巧思。 玩轉圖騰的鬼才Vexx更巧妙將 Samsonite經典旋渦Logo隱身畫面中，彷彿在邀請旅人尋找專屬的隱藏彩蛋，傳遞出與Samsonite不謀而合的「旅行即探索」精神，搭配C-Lite 專利 Curv®材質所打造的輕韌箱體及360度平滑雙輪、組織化內袋設計等實用配件，將旅程徹底轉化為一場輕鬆愉快的冒險。 出生於1998年的Vexx，本名Vince Okerman，是出身比利時布魯塞爾、當代最受矚目的年輕藝術家之一。 他以鮮明的「Doodles」塗鴉風格席捲全球，以飽滿色彩、童趣角色與流行文化交織，創造出獨特的夢幻藝術宇宙。 因為其獨樹一格視覺美學，Vexx在短短幾年內迅速累積超過280萬YouTube訂閱、近75萬Instagram粉絲，並曾與Porsche、Disney、Gucci、Puma、Nickelodeon等國際知名品牌合作。 談及此次與旅箱龍頭Samsonite的合作靈感，Vexx表示：「把一只經典行李箱變成塗鴉的舞台，是我一直夢想的事。 『Day&Night』象徵每一段旅行的起承轉合，也是藝術與生活交融的縮影。」 Samsonite 歐洲區副總裁暨總經理 Gianpaolo Sala也分享：「我們深信旅行本身就是一種創作。 與Vexx攜手，是將實用功能與創意精神緊密結合的最佳證明。」 C-Lite x Vexx 系列不僅是一件行李箱，更是一場勇於探索的邀請，一種大膽表達自我的宣言，將每一趟旅程化作天馬行空的色彩冒險。 這次C-Lite  x Vexx聯名系列，承襲Samsonite一貫的頂級工藝和細節把關，沿用專利 Curv®材質，兼具超輕量結構與強韌保護，28吋空箱僅重2.8公斤，配備滑順無比的靜音雙輪、舒適拉桿及TSA海關鎖，完美平衡風格與功能。 全系列提供 20吋及28吋兩種尺寸，無論長途旅行或短程出差，
C-Lite x Vexx都是能提供最佳解決方案，成為定義自我風格的行走畫布，每一次啟程，都是藝術與旅行交織的全新篇章。 Samsonite x Vexx C-Lite限量系列已於全台指定 Samsonite門市與官方網站同步上市，數量有限，售完為止。"

mov_7B7E1E2ECE8C1FCE97669EFB7D42F628,2025-07-08 10:37:21,id,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[id]KRJOGJA.com -Jakarta- Di tengah sorotan luas atas pencatatan perdana PT Indokripto Koin Semesta Tbk (COIN) di Bursa Efek Indonesia (BEI) yang akan berlangsung Rabu (9/7) besok, pengamat hukum dan pembangunan Hardjuno Wiwoho mengingatkan arti penting menjaga integritas, governance, dan kepercayaan publik dalam momentum bersejarah ini. “IPO COIN memang mencatatkan diri sebagai tonggak baru di pasar modal nasional. Tapi justru karena statusnya sebagai pionir, integritasnya harus tanpa cela. Jangan sampai pencapaian ini menciptakan preseden yang keliru,” tegas Hardjuno dalam pernyataan tertulisnya di Jakarta, Selasa (8/7). Sebagai informasi, COIN adalah perusahaan induk dari dua entitas penting dalam industri kripto Indonesia—bursa kripto CFX dan kustodian aset digital ICC—yang disebut-sebut sebagai yang pertama dan satu-satunya di Indonesia saat ini. IPO COIN sendiri telah mengalami kelebihan permintaan (oversubscribe) hingga lebih dari 70 kali lipat dengan lebih dari 100 ribu calon investor ikut serta. Baca Juga: Dapat Siswa 8 Rombel Tahun Ajaran 2025/2026, SMP Muhi Yogya Gelar Raker Meski begitu, publik juga tengah menyoroti profil salah satu pihak yang diduga memiliki pengaruh signifikan dalam COIN, yakni Andrew Hidayat. Namanya disebut dalam prospektus IPO sebagai bagian dari pemilik manfaat utama (Ultimate Beneficial Owner/UBO) bersama beberapa tokoh lainnya. Andrew sendiri diketahui pernah divonis dua tahun penjara oleh pengadilan tindak pidana korupsi pada tahun 2015, dalam kasus suap perizinan tambang batu bara yang juga menyeret anggota DPR saat itu. Tak hanya itu, Andrew juga diduga terlibat dalam kontroversi penetapan pemenang tender atas aset sitaan negara dalam perkara Jiwasraya, yakni tambang milik PT GBU yang dibeli oleh PT Indobara Utama Mandiri (IUM). Perusahaan ini disebut-sebut sebagai milik Andrew, meskipun hal tersebut belum diklarifikasi secara terbuka oleh pihak yang bersangkutan. Namun demikian, dalam pernyataan resmi yang disampaikan kepada media, pihak COIN menyatakan bahwa Andrew Hidayat bukanlah pemilik manfaat akhir (UBO) dari perusahaan. Klarifikasi ini menjadi bagian penting dalam menjawab kekhawatiran publik, meskipun Hardjuno menilai bahwa status formal kepemilikan tidak boleh mengaburkan kebutuhan akan integritas personal dan rekam jejak dalam proses IPO.

Pasar modal adalah institusi kepercayaan, dan calon emiten harus bersih tidak hanya dari sisi laporan keuangan, tapi juga dari aspek governance,” ujarnya. Ia menambahkan bahwa regulasi seperti Peraturan BAPPEBTI No. 8 Tahun 2021 memang tidak menyebut secara eksplisit pelarangan bagi individu dengan catatan pidana ekonomi untuk mendirikan perusahaan kripto. Namun, semangat regulasi tersebut jelas mendorong transparansi, perlindungan investor, dan tata kelola yang sehat. “Ini soal membangun ekosistem jangka panjang. Jika saat ini kita membiarkan pihak-pihak dengan latar belakang yang diduga bermasalah masuk ke dalam sistem, bagaimana kita bisa membangun kepercayaan terhadap pasar aset digital Indonesia?” ujarnya.

Ia menyinggung kasus BitMEX di Amerika Serikat, di mana para pendirinya harus menjalani hukuman pidana karena pelanggaran anti pencucian uang. Ia juga menyebut kasus Thodex di Turki, di mana pendirinya kabur bersama miliaran dolar dana investor sebelum akhirnya dijatuhi vonis lebih dari 11 ribu tahun penjara.  "

原来赚钱的生意，都写在XF外沿？ 😺
1️⃣ AI虚拟遗产修复：死人生意才是暴利
👉 操作：
用DeepSeek-R1克隆逝者声音+修复老照片→做成会说话的动态影像
👉 渠道：
老年大学社群地推，和殡葬公司五五分成
👉 定价：
基础修复99元（老照片上色），动态影像+语音交互299元（客户哭着加钱）
🤫
2️⃣跨境直播爆品搬运：美国人替我打工
👉 操作：
蹲TikTok美区直播间录屏→用AI翻译字幕→挂拼多多同款到抖音小店
👉 关键：
标题必须带「北美断货王」「硅谷精英同款」
👉 利润：
15块的瑜伽裤贴个英文标卖89元，广东00后靠这招月入6w+（他说美国人根本不懂1688）
💰
3️⃣ 政策补贴代办：割企业的韭菜最香
👉 操作：
扒政府官网的补贴文件（科技/农业/跨境电商）→包装成「申办套餐」卖给小老板
👉 变现：
基础咨询费500，全包抽成补贴金额15%
👉 案例：
杭州团队专做「跨境电商补贴」，帮客户薅到320w补贴，自己抽佣47w（老板还送锦旗）
👍
4️⃣ 奢侈品鉴定转售：中古包才是理财产品
👉 操作：
日本煤炉淘3000元的Gucci→国内挂「中检认证孤品」卖8000

👉 利润：
见大佬朋友圈截图（上周刚卖了个掉皮的香奈儿，买家说「 vintage的残缺美才值钱」）
大佬最后叼着烟说：
‼️ 别学马斯克改变世界，9亿没坐过飞机的人，才是你的市场！ 🤫
现在他公司20人团队就干三件事：
✅ 盯着美国人发明新需求
✅ 跟着政策文件找补贴
✅ 专做「觉得low但暴利」的生意

Models emerged from an ornate entrance, parading long- skirted dresses in soft toned tweeds, with touches of sparkles and tufts of feathers. They wore tight buns and tall boots, which left u-shaped heel indentations in the plush carpet. Colors were muted, mostly ivory, beige and brown, but one silky dress came in a pale silvery blue, worn under a short, yellow-toned bomber jacket with a prominent, feathery collar. The show was held in the Salon d'Honneur, a smaller space of the freshly-restored Grand Palais, marking a contrast with the soaring, central exhibition hall usually favored by the label. Facing a prolonged slump, many labels in the high end fashion industry are renewing their design approach, with Kering-owned Gucci and Balenciaga, and LVMH's Dior among labels that have recently named new designers. After the show, guests lingered, making their way slowly down grand staircases, stopping for photos of the building's elaborate ironwork and gilded wall decorations.

midu_b550dfff2c3621fb3028bb38f8feddc9,2025-07-08 13:59:34,zh,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[zh]人类与其他动物的区别之一，在于我们擅长使用工具，并以此不断重塑自己所处的环境。 在我看来人工智能无疑已经成为最具变革力的新“工具”之一
无论从服装设计、生产、传播，还是消费行为来看，AI正在悄无声息地侵入、甚至重构整个时尚行业的生态体系。 服装设计与ai将形成密不可分的状态我认为这是必然趋势
时代的变革往往就发生在我们身边
我记得很小的时候我第一次网购当时还需要去银行办理u盾（类似于u盘一样）通过u盾保护你的资金才能进行网购。 反观于现在这简直就是对此一举 甚至于以前大家都在用现金支付慢慢的手机支付悄然完成了变革时代的使命
这也让我想到一句话：太阳底下无新鲜事本质意义上一样是在推动时代的向前发展只不过换了个形式而已
朋友曾经提到过他们家的工厂用ai+3D立体制版已经有一段时间了他能够更高效的提升工作效率降低生产成本体现拉伸与垂坠感等等同时
这让我觉得教育真的是落后的很多学校的制版还在用一些老的软件让学生毕业就马上失去了竞争力
在我看来现在的ai也是如此一样在进行着悄然的变革
我清楚的记得前段时间chatgpt刚刚出现的时候网络上很多人都在担心自己所从事的行业之后会不会被人工智能所替代等等的焦虑问题
这种思考模式无疑是将自己放在了人工智能的对立面
人工智能只是工具和助手
如何与人工智能共创如何利用人工智能创造价值
这才是作为我们从业者应该去思考的问题
设计师，仍将是那个注入灵魂与文化脉络的源头
一味的排斥与傲慢终究会将自己踢下时代的快船
最早的人工智能与时尚的结合已经开始回顾到9年前
HM与Google一同开发了Project Muze
由AI根据用户的兴趣、情绪、审美风格等，自动生成个性化服装设计草图
现在与ai有关的时尚案例也比比皆是
Gucci × AI情绪识别：分析消费者面部表情匹配产品风格
Prada × AI趋势建模：使用大数据构建当季系列风格参考
Adobe Firefly：服装设计师直接用文本生成图案、织纹或印花
人工智能将碎片化的信息不再碎片化
接受它、理解它、利用它，我们才有可能在这场时代的洪流中，继续保有属于“人”的创造力与温度
我个人认为这正是下一个十年，时尚最值得期待的方向

Das dritte Grand-Slam-Tennisturnier hat am 30. Juni begonnen und dauert bis zum 13. Juli. Einige wichtige Spielerinnen und Spieler sind bereits aus dem ausgeschieden, darunter auch Alexander Zverev (der in der Weltrangliste der Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), dem Dachverband des Herrentennis, auf Platz Drei liegt), Daniil Medvedev (Nummer neun der Weltrangliste der Männer) und Frances Tiafoe (Nummer zwölf). Bei den Frauen sind auch schon die Spielerinnen herausgeflogen, die in der Weltrangliste die Nummern zwei bis fünf haben: Coco Gauff, Jessica Pegula, Jasmine Paolini und Zheng Qinwen. Mit anderen Worten: Es ist ein Spiel für jedermann. Tennis ist eine der größten Sportarten der Welt, und """" zufolge wächst die Zahl der Spielerinnen und Spieler ständig. Zwischen 2023 und 2024 wird die Zahl der Tennisspielenden in den USA um fast zwei Millionen steigen. Ein professioneller Tennisspieler zu werden, ist zwar anstrengend, kann aber auch zu einem riesigen Geldsegen führen. """" hat eine Rangliste der bestbezahlten Tennisspielerinnen und -spieler der Welt im Jahr 2024 erstellt, die Verdienstspanne reicht von 13,7 Millionen US-Dollar (11,7 Millionen Euro) bis hin zu stolzen 42,3 Millionen Dollar (36,1 Millionen Euro). Hier sind die bestverdienenden Tennisprofis der Welt — und wie sie es dorthin geschafft haben. Hannah Peters/ 10. Aryna Sabalenka Sabalenka, eine 27-jährige Championin aus Weißrussland, wird als Favoritin für Wimbledon gehandelt und ist die einzige Frau aus den Top 5, die noch im Wettbewerb ist. Sie ist außerdem die Nummer 1 der Weltrangliste der Women's Tennis Association (. „Forbes“ berichtete, dass Sabalenka im vergangenen Jahr insgesamt 13,7 Millionen Dollar (11,7 Millionen Euro) verdient hat: 6,7 Millionen Dollar (5,7 Millionen Euro) an Preisgeldern und sieben Millionen Dollar (sechs Millionen Euro) an Sponsoring und anderen Verträgen. Zuletzt gewann sie die US Open 2024 und die Australian Open 2024. Außerdem erreichte sie das Finale der Australian Open 2025 und der French Open 2025. Sabalenka, die drei Millionen Follower auf hat, unterhält Partnerschaften mit Wilson, Nike und Audemars Piguet. Dan Istitene/ 9. Casper Ruud Ruud hat dieses Jahr Wimbledon ausgelassen, obwohl er Platz 15 der Weltrangliste der Männer belegt. Am 21. Juni gab er nach Berichten von „“ bekannt, dass eine Knieverletzung seine Spielfähigkeit beeinträchtigte. Der 26-Jährige stammt aus Norwegen und obwohl er noch nie einen Grand Slam gewonnen hat (er war dreimal Zweiter), hat er dennoch eine Menge Geld verdient. „Forbes“ schätzt, dass er im 2024 13,9 Millionen Dollar (11,9 Millionen Euro) verdient hat. Davon zehn Millionen Dollar (8,5 Millioinen Euro) durch Aktivitäten außerhalb des Tennisplatzes und 3,9 Millionen Dollar (3,3 Millionen Euro) mdurch Preisgelder. Seine größten Sponsoren sind Samsonite, Vitamin Well, die Uhrenmarke Fleming, Yonex und Varsity Headwear. Paul Crock/AFP/ 8. Naomi Osaka Die 27-jährige Osaka ist seit ihrem überraschenden Sieg gegen Serena Williams bei den US Open 2018 eine der bekanntesten Tennisspielerinnen der Welt. In den folgenden Jahren gewann sie ein weiteres Mal die US Open und zweimal die Australian Open. In diesem Jahr schaffte sie es zum ersten Mal seit 2018 wieder in die dritte Runde von Wimbledon, schied jedoch gegen Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova aus. Die in Japan geborene Osaka verdiente im vergangenen Jahr schätzungsweise 14,6 Millionen Dollar (12,4 Millionen Euro), davon stammten nur 600.000 Dollar (511.400 Euro) aus Preisgeldern, berichtet „Forbes“. Die restlichen 14 Millionen Dollar (11,9 Millionen Euro) stammen aus Partnerschaften außerhalb des Tennisplatzes mit Maybelline, Etsy, Nike und ihrer eigenen Medienfirma . Außerdem hat sie eine beeindruckend treue Fangemeinde mit 2,8 Millionen -Followern. Clive Brunskill/ 7. Daniil Medwedew Medwedew, Platz 9 in der Weltrangliste der Männer, ist dieses Jahr bereits aus Wimbledon ausgeschieden. Aber das sollte den 29-Jährigen nicht lange niederschlagen. Er hat mehrere Grand-Slam-Finale erreicht und 2021 die US Open gewonnen. Außerdem schaffte er es bei den Olympischen Spielen 2020 als Teil des Russischen Olympischen Komitees bis ins Viertelfinale. Natürlich sollten auch seine Einnahmen von 20,3 Millionen Dollar (17,3 Millionen Euro) aus dem vergangenen Jahr ein schöner Trostpreis sein. Medwedew hat hochkarätige Verträge mit den Videospielmarken EA Sports und Ubisoft, da er selbst ein Gamer ist, sowie mit Lacoste, BMW und Tecnifibre, die sich „Forbes“ zufolge auf insgesamt 13 Millionen Dollar (11,1 Millionen Euro) belaufen. Zudem verdiente er im vergangenen Jahr 7,3 Millionen Dollar (6,2 Millionen Euro) an Preisgeldern. Dimitar DILKOFF/AFP/ 6. Rafael Nadal Technisch gesehen ist Nadal kein Tennisspieler mehr. Er trat 2024 im Alter von 38 Jahren zurück und war einer von drei Männern, die den Karriere-Golden-Slam im Herreneinzel (alle vier Grand-Slam-Turniere plus eine Goldmedaille bei den Olympischen Spielen) gewonnen haben. In seinem letzten vollen Jahr als Profi verdiente er jedoch 23,3 Millionen Dollar (19,9 Millionen Euro). Der Großteil davon (genauer gesagt 23 Millionen Dollar, also 19,6 Millionen Euro) wurde außerhalb des Tennisplatzes verdient. Im Laufe seiner Karriere verdiente er über 120 Millionen Dollar (102,3 Millionen Euro) an Preisgeldern.

Jed Cullen/Dave Benett/ Luke Newton is stepping into the world of fashion with some major shoes to fill. The actor, who broke through on the Regency-era Netflix series Bridgerton, has joined the cast of Darrah Cloud's House of McQueen as the titular Lee Alexander McQueen.

mov_89B9919E7F465DCE734966C63E7EEBFC,2025-07-08 18:24:00,en,WEB,"  Chanel's Golden Couture Shines During Paris Haute Couture Week Chanel returned to the Grand Palais this morning for its Fall 2025 haute couture collection, held in the venue's Salon d'Honneur during Paris Haute Couture Week. Inspired by the simplicity of nature and Chanel's 31 rue Cambon ateliers, the line was the last created by the label's in-house team before new creative director Matthieu Blazy's first runway debuts in October. Tweed skirt suits, separates, and dresses were crafted in smooth knits and soft mohair, cast in tonal shades of deep gold, cream, plum, black, and dark green. Added levity came from multicolored flowers, seen in embroidery on dresses and coats. Wheat ears—which Gabrielle Chanel saw as a symbol of abundance—were prominent throughout the collection, embroidered across dresses, embossed on sparkling buttons, and clutched in a golden bouquet held by the show's finale bride. A star-studded crowd was in attendance for the occasion as well, including Lorde, Gracie Abrams, Keira Knightley, Naomi Campbell, Laufey, Kirsten Dunst, Sofia Coppola, Romy Mars, Cosima Mars, Marion Cotillard, and more. All images: Courtesy of Chanel Saks Fifth Avenue, Bergdorf Goodman, and Neiman Marcus Face Dropping Summer Sales It's shaping up to be a challenging sales year for luxury brands—including Saks Fifth Avenue. The retailer, which merged earlier this year with Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf Goodman in a $2.7 billion deal, has faced a sales drop of 28% compared to 2024, according to The Business of Fashion. Alongside Saks, Neiman Marcus and Bergdorf's sales also dropped 26% each compared to last year. The shift follows Saks Global's release of its financial performance in May, where the combined revenue of Saks, Neiman's, and Bergdorf's dropped 10% to $7.3 billion. The group's low sales also follow the luxury slowdown of 2024 that's continued into 2025, with decreasing sales affecting brands including Chanel, Hermès, Gucci, Burberry, and more.

The musician covers the magazine's new July 2025 issue, outfitted in Calvin Klein's denim and sharp separates. While speaking with writer Charlie Kolbrener in his accompanying feature profile, Role Model chats about the rerelease of his album Kansas Anymore, new role in Lena Dunham's upcoming Netflix film Good Sex, and friendship with fellow star Gracie Abrams—who he's also touring with this year. “She was one of the first people I met and hung around with when I first moved to LA, and was just very welcoming,” Pillsbury said. “She was about to put out her first EP Minor. I feel like I've had the privilege of watching her from that very beginning moment to now doing massive arena shows around the world and exploding, rightfully so. It's cool now, I get to watch it side stage. It's a very full circle moment for me personally.

The policy, which has existed at U.S. airports from the Transportation Security Administration since 2006, is being phased out this year, according to People. Some airports have already let passengers keep their shoes on while checking in, including Baltimore/Washington International Airport, Portland International Airport, Philadelphia International Airport, Fort Lauderdale International Airport, Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport, and Piedmont Triad International Airport. As of Monday, the New York City's LaGuardia Airport and Los Angeles International Airport have also apparently begun implanting the new policy as well. However, if passengers' shoes trigger security scanners, they will still have to remove their shoes to be screened. (firstVIEW) Additional reporting by Julia Karns and Katie Bradshaw.

But the AU left out a lot of the nitty gritty of how exactly things came to be better seven years down the line (for time, like everything else in season 2). We're left to imagine what Heimerdinger did behind the scenes, etc. The implication of Silco finding the letter is definitely there, otherwise it wouldn't have been introduced, but it being the end-all be-all of him and Vander being gucci again is fan speculation. We might as well imagine there's a longer, deeper story that took place off screen and just wasn't specified within the 40 minutes of the episode and the couple of lines we get about the two of them in it."

mov_6C0D9C5ACF811B62BA14A78D0CDD0504,2025-07-08 19:52:00,en,WEB,"  It's easy to think that once you crack six figures, you're in the clear financially. But that assumption doesn't always hold up. One-third of Americans earning over $200,000 a year say they're still living paycheck-to-paycheck, according to a 2024 report by PYMNTS Intelligence. Turns out wealth isn't just about how much you earn, it's about how you think and what you do with it. Here are the top five ways wealthy people approach life, career and finances differently from the rest of us. Contrary to popular belief, most multimillionaires are not cruising around in neon orange Lamborghinis or smoking cigars stashed in their Gucci bags. Instead, many wealthy Americans are trying to hide their wealth rather than flaunt it. The “stealth wealth” or “quiet luxury” trend was highlighted in the 2024 National Millionaires Survey by Ramsey Solutions, which found that the top three car brands preferred by the wealthy were Toyota, Honda and Ford. Simply put: wealthy Americans stay wealthy by resisting the urge to flaunt it. Another major psychological difference between the rich and the poor is their ability to delay gratification. In 2016, the National Bureau of Economic Research surveyed Americans over the age of 70 to see how much extra they'd need to wait a year for $100. Would they need $10 or $30? Those who required less compensation had greater patience and were better at delaying gratification, which was closely linked with their actual wealth and financial well-being. In short, the ability to resist instant gratification is a key sign of future financial success. Because they're better at delaying gratification, wealthier Americans are more likely to invest their money rather than spend it. A 2024 Gallup poll found that 31% of upper-income Americans believe stocks are the best investment. Only 7% said a savings account was a good investment. In contrast, 20% of lower-income Americans chose savings accounts as the best investment, while just 14% preferred stocks. This difference in strategy highlights a key mindset shift. Many lower-income households avoid risk and prefer safety, while wealthier households are more familiar with the potential rewards of riskier assets. Debt isn't good or bad — it's all about how it's used. Lower-income households are more likely to rely on expensive forms of debt to cover daily spending. About 18% of households earning between $25,000 and $49,999 used buy-now-pay-later programs in 2023, compared to just 10% for those earning more than $100,000, according to the Federal Reserve. Wealthier Americans tend to use debt for productive investments, such as real estate or business ventures. These assets have the potential to grow in value, while consumer goods like cars or electronics lose value over time. Rethinking how you use debt could be a game-changer on your path to building wealth. In a constantly shifting economy, wealthier individuals know the key to preserving and growing wealth is to keep learning new skills and adapting to unexpected changes. Whether it's signing up for professional courses, attending workshops and expanding your horizons, could give your career the boost it needs to step up wealth creation.

Ahora Balenciaga vuelve a convertirse en tenencia luego de vender una pieza con aspecto desgastado y antiguo por un precio que la mayoría de la gente probablemente nunca querría gastar. Y es que es un sector que mueve miles de millones de dólares cada año y marca tendencias que moldean no solo el consumo, sino también la cultura y la economía global. Según datos de Statista, en 2024 el mercado mundial de la moda alcanzó un valor estimado de 1.7 billones de dólares, y se prevé que supere los 2 billones en los próximos tres años. Así son los Puma “atropellados” de Balenciaga Balenciaga vuelve a poner a prueba los límites de la moda y el sentido común del consumidor. Esta vez, la firma de lujo española decidió colaborar con Puma para reinventar las icónicas zapatillas Speedcat de 1999, pero con un giro que ha dejado a más de uno rascándose la cabeza (y revisando su cuenta bancaria). El resultado es un par de tenis con aspecto deliberadamente envejecido, suela plana y un aire “grunge” que parece recién salido de una tienda de segunda mano. El precio, sin embargo, dista de ser de segunda mano, 685 dólares, casi siete veces el costo original de las Speedcat, que rondan los 100 dólares. El toque Balenciaga la marca estampada en lengüeta y laterales, la eliminación del logo de Puma y un acabado rasgado es suficiente para multiplicar su valor de mercado y alimentar un debate que ya es recurrente: ¿hasta dónde llega la ironía en la moda de lujo? Los tenis Balenciaga x Puma La colección, lanzada a finales de junio como parte de la propuesta de invierno 2025 de Balenciaga, incluye opciones en colores como “blanco sucio” y “negro súper desteñido”, reforzando la estética de prenda (o calzado) maltratado que ya es una seña de identidad para la marca. La estrategia es clara: provocar conversación, apuntar a un nicho que consume la exclusividad como una forma de arte performativo y mantener a Balenciaga en la conversación digital. Y vaya sí lo consiguieron. Un video de @hypebeast en TikTok mostrando el nuevo modelo desató una oleada de comentarios irónicos y memes. “¿Los encontraste en la tienda de segunda mano?” , “Otra estafa de Balenciaga para ricos” o “Nota mental: nunca colabores con Balenciaga si no quieres un zapato aplastado por maquinaria pesada”, fueron algunos de los mensajes que evidencian el escepticismo y, para muchos, la burla que genera la estrategia de la marca. No es la primera vez que Balenciaga abraza la estética de lo roto y usado como sinónimo de alta costura. En febrero, la firma vendió una camiseta desgastada por 595 dólares y una sudadera con capucha y dobladillos destrozados por mil 190 dólares, justo para el Día de San Valentín. Estos lanzamientos, lejos de espantar a su público objetivo, parecen alimentar un fenómeno de “lujo irónico” donde el precio elevado funciona como filtro social: no se paga por el diseño, sino por pertenecer a un club capaz de gastar cientos de dólares en piezas que otros verían como basura. De acuerdo con datos de Statista, Balenciaga cerró 2024 con ingresos estimados en mil 750 millones de euros, consolidándose como una de las marcas más rentables de Kering, el conglomerado que también controla Gucci y Saint Laurent. Parte de su éxito reside, precisamente, en la capacidad de generar ruido mediático para bien o para mal y convertir cada pieza polémica en un símbolo de conversación viral. Mientras algunos críticos celebran la creatividad y el discurso anti-convencional de Balenciaga, otros ven estas colecciones como un recordatorio de la desconexión entre la moda de lujo y la realidad de la mayoría. Para bien o para mal, la marca sigue demostrando que, en el universo del high fashion, a veces la controversia es el mejor accesorio para seguir vendiendo exclusividad.

mov_2D2C5C9F165679D0A267720A61495321,2025-07-08 21:31:52,en,WEB,"  More than 15 years after Alexander McQueen's death, the fashion designer's career is coming into sharper focus with an off-Broadway show. One of the most acclaimed and incendiary designers of his generation, McQueen took his life in 2010 at the age of 40 in London. Daring and original with his designs and runway shows, the British-born talent burst on the scene in the 1990s. The son of a taxi driver and self-described “big mouth East English yob,” McQueen rose to the top of the fashion world. With his 1995 controversial Highland Rape collection that used remnants from fabric shops, McQueen caught the attention of European luxury titans. In 1996, Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH Moët Hennessy Louis Vuitton, tapped the then-27-year-old to be the creative lead at Givenchy, a post he held for five years. In 2000, the Gucci Group bought a 51 percent stake in McQueen's company, allowing for expansion via signature boutiques; a secondary line called McQ licensed to Italy's SINV; menswear and leather goods, and collaborations with brands including Puma and Samsonite. Despite such reach and a Target collaboration in 2009, his namesake company did not have the financial might of his rivals, during his lifetime. A decade in the making, “House of McQueen” starts previews next month and the grand opening will be held Sept. 9 at the Mansion at Hudson Yards. In a joint interview Tuesday with show producer Rick Lazes and Gary McQueen, a nephew of the designer, Lazes said, “What would Lee do?” was their mantra, whenever they felt tripped up. (The designer was known as Lee to family and close friends.) The theater — the first new one to be built in Manhattan in more than 20 years — was financed and designed by their company Alexander McQueen LLC. McQueen said, “There are obviously a lot of complexities in Lee's life, both personally and his rise into the elites of fashion from his humble beginnings. That is really a true underdog story, and a very inspiring one. Hopefully, what we've achieved with this inspires the younger generation who don't really know Alexander McQueen the person, but also satisfies long-term fans of my uncle's work. It does touch some personal stuff.” Lazes said, “No matter what obstacles he encountered, he overcame them and his art continued to flourish, Despite adversity and the mercantile pressure of the fashion industry, his genius shone through. We're hoping people will leave the theater feeling like they've seen genius. For those who don't know McQueen, it will be like seeing Picasso for the first time. He [McQueen] was never accepted as a great artist, which he clearly was. He was always relegated as a fashion designer. We're hoping people will see that he influenced not only the fashion world, but music, art and pop culture. And he still does today.” Meant to be a well-rounded and entertaining representation of the designer's life, the 90-minute seated performance will feature “Bridgerton” actor Luke Newton in the lead role. Family members and other key figures in McQueen's life like Isabella Blow will also be portrayed. Ticket holders will also have access to a concurrent exhibition of original McQueen gowns that will be adjacent to the theater. With more than 1,000 square feet of LED screens, the show will feature creative content that was developed with Gary McQueen's oversight about Lee's motivation, thoughts and drive for creative genius to play up his art, work and spirit. Needless to say McQueen-designed pieces will not be worn by the actors. To write the play, Darrah Cloud drew from previous media interviews with the designer and from conversations with his nephew, who is an artist. After Gary McQueen lost his father unexpectedly, Lee McQueen stepped in to babysit him as an older brother might. Years later, they worked together. He said, “There's a certain spirit attached to being a McQueen. I share a similar aesthetic that is both inspired by Lee, but that is also quite inherent to myself,” his nephew said. What I've learned from Lee is what fashion could be. It went way beyond clothes and fashion. It was about storytelling and artistry.” Looking forward to sharing McQueen's mannerisms and gestures with Newton, Gary McQueen said, “Lee almost had two sides to himself, where he had a split personality. He was a very down-to-earth person, and at other times, he was Alexander McQueen, who ruled his kingdom in the fashion world. He kind of separated himself from family and to who he was professionally.” Showgoers may be surprised by how McQueen managed “to break down barriers and the snobbery that was attached to fashion houses at that time,” his nephew said. Coming of age in the 1990s, when many edgy designers and artists were making waves in various industries, that trajectory is “very relatable to how the world is quite a hard place today.” Gary McQueen's aim is to continue his uncle's legacy through his art. Wishful that they had had more time together, he said, “Lee could have achieved so much more. He never ran out of creative ideas. The only thing that took the joy away from what he did was the pressures of coming up with so many collections. As an artist, that really gets in the way of being creative. I feel that the pressure got to be too much for him.” Innovative with technology, the designer crafted a hologram of Kate Moss for his fall 2006 runway show. Speculating how technical advances like 3D printing and other ones used by Iris Van Herpen would have appealed to McQueen, his nephew said, “There was a lot more that he could have achieved...."

Carie Hallford, who ran Return to Nature Funeral Home with her husband Jon Hallford, allegedly duped the Small Business Administration out of almost $900,000 in pandemic-era relief aid and cheated customers who had paid for cremations the Hallfords never performed. Instead, the Hallfords are accused of spending the aid and customers' payments on lavish goods — luxury cars, cryptocurrency and items from stores like Gucci — all while stashing the bodies and sending fake ashes to the families. The Hallfords were charged with 15 fraud counts last year in federal court, where Jon Hallford already pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud and was sentenced to 20 years in prison last month. Carie Hallford is set to change her plea in federal court from not guilty in early August, and is expected to plead guilty, according to a spokesperson for the U.S. Attorney's Office in Colorado. Hallford's attorney, Robert Charles Melihercik, did not immediately respond to requests for comment. In a separate case in state court, Jon and Carie Hallford are both charged with 191 counts of corpse abuse for allegedly stashing the bodies between 2019 and 2023 and burying the wrong body in two instances. The building in Penrose, about a two-hour drive south of Denver, was searched in 2023. Officials discovered bodies stacked atop each other, swarms of bugs and fluid covering the floor. Families were shaken to learn their loved ones' remains weren't in the ashes they had spread, but were instead left decaying, some for four years."

We now enter into a period of transition where we will be liaising closely with the European team and we look forward to welcoming Jordan Sutkiewicz, Michelle Ceresney and European's employees to the Birks family.” Eric Sutkiewicz, Lynn Sutkiewicz, Jordan Sutkiewicz and Michelle Ceresney, the former owners of European, commented: “After nearly 50 wonderful years of serving our loyal clients, we are proud to have sold our family business to Birks Group, a well-respected and trusted pan-Canadian retailer of fine jewellery, watches and gifts that shares the same commitment to quality and customer service as European. We would like to thank all of our team, colleagues, partners and friends at European for their dedication and support. We wish them much success under the leadership of Birks Group.” In connection with the Acquisition and as previously announced, Birks Group also obtained an additional term loan of $13.5 million (the “Incremental Loan”) with SLR Credit Solutions (“SLR”), one of the Company's current senior lenders. The Incremental Loan bears interest at the same rate as our current $12.5 million term loan with SLR which is CORRA plus (i) a CORRA adjustment of 0.32% and (ii) 7.75%, and it will be repayable, in full, on December 24, 2026. A portion of the proceeds from the Incremental Loan were used by the Company to fund the purchase price for the Acquisition and the balance of the proceeds will be used to fund ordinary course working capital. The Company also entered into a loan agreement for $3.75 million of additional indebtedness (the “Loan Agreement”) with Mangrove Holding S.A., one of the Company's controlling shareholders. The Loan Agreement bears annual interest at 15% and it will be repayable, in full, on December 24, 2026. The proceeds from the Loan Agreement will be used to fund ordinary course working capital. Rebecca Tarby, Senior Managing Director of SLR, commented: “Birks Group and SLR have enjoyed a long-term business relationship for over 15 years, and we are pleased to support Birks Group's continued growth and success.” The Company continues to be actively engaged in identifying alternative transactions to continue pursuing its strategic goals including raising additional funds through public or private equity, debt financing, and the completion of strategic acquisitions.

(Jemal Countess/WireImage for Saks Fifth Ave – NY) An off-Broadway play celebrating the life and career of gay fashion designer Alexander McQueen, titled House of McQueen, is in the works, and a Bridgerton star is set to portray the late icon. On Tuesday (8 July), Deadline reported that none other than actor Luke Newton will be stepping into McQueen's metaphorical dress shoes in the production, House of McQueen. The out gay fashion designer died in 2010 at the age of 40. Newton is best known for his role as Colin Bridgerton in the Netflix series, who was the star couple in season three, alongside Nicola Coughlan's Penelope Featherington. Luke Newton is set to portray the late gay fashion star. (Jed Cullen/Dave Benett/ for British Vogue) The official synopsis for the play reads: “House of McQueen is a new Off-Broadway play about the life and work of iconic fashion designer Alexander McQueen as told from his own revolutionary, daring and elegant perspective. It is the story of a boy born in the East End of London, who literally wears his heart on his sleeve, never meant to rise beyond his working-class family. “From making doll clothes for his mother's friends to working in a tailor shop, he rises to the top of the fashion industry as chief designer for Givenchy and head of his own legendary fashion line, as his fashion shows become theatrical and artistic spectacles, attracting countless celebrities. “Seeking to find beauty in the most devastating aspects of life, McQueen envisions and creates clothes to empower women in response to what is happening in his life and the world around him. Fighting against the commercial interests of legendary houses like Givenchy and Gucci to remain provocative, he challenges norms and pushes boundaries as an artist. In the end, the fight consumes him.” Directing House of McQueen is Angels in America director Sam Helfrich, while Rick Lazes (Lennox Lewis: The Untold Story), and McQueen's nephew, Gary James, are both joining as executive producer and creative director, respectively. The rest of the cast for the show is yet to be announced. Newton is not the only Bridgerton star to appear on stage after starring in the steamy period drama. His co-star, Jonathan Bailey, who plays his on-screen older brother Viscount Anthony Bridgerton, has been praised for his turn in the Shakespeare classic, Richard II. Meanwhile, other series stars, including Adoja Andoh, Luke Thompson, Golda Rosheuvel, and Regé-Jean Page, have an impressive collection of theatre credits. Previews for House of McQueen are set to launch at The Mansion at Hudson Yards, New York, on 19 August. The official opening is set for 9 September. Share your thoughts!

Bhavninder Sanghera shared a post to his Instagram story on Tuesday after he received a message from the popular influencer on a previous video he had shared. The woman criticised the bright red Gucci outfit he wore to the Australian premiere of Superman. 'Jesus Christ Jack I'm not being funny but he looks like the worst version of a Bollywood actor of the sea in my life. What the f**k are those veneers lol,' the comment, which was sent to the wrong person, read. Bhavninder hit back, writing: 'When someone tries to talk behind your back but accidentally replies to your story instead.' From A-list scandals and red carpet mishaps to exclusive pictures and viral moments, subscribe to the DailyMail's new showbiz newsletter to stay in the loop. 'How negative and rude are some people? Please don't book this horrible and racist human being for makeup. 'I don't even have veneers, my teeth are natural! Just whitened by the dentist. Being a kind and decent person doesn't cost anything.' It comes after Aussie model Rachael Finch also recently shared a horrific message she received from an online hater, and hit back at the troll. The former Miss Universe runner-up, 36, took to Instagram in May to read out a brutal email she was sent via her supplement brand Kissed Earth. The message slammed the company for being 'boring' and accused Rachael of giving children Violet, nine, and Dominic, six, a 'life of boredom and misery'. 'Just wanted to know why this brand of product is any different or more effective than the millions that are already on the market,' the message began. 'It's just so boring. The market is well over-saturated, so what is your point of difference? Or is it that it is owned by a runner-up Miss Australia from 16 years ago?' 'Is that how she justifies her excessive price point? Also, what medical doctors were consulted in the development of the powdered oral range?' it continued. The hate message went on to say humans 'have existed and thrived on this planet for millions of years' without the help of 'gut tonics or turmeric enemas'. 'You are just the most boring and angular-faced woman on Australian TV,' they added. The troll then accused Rachael of making 'controversial statements online just to get people thinking' about the mother-of-two and her brand. 'People don't like you because your kids live a life of boredom and misery,' they said, referencing the gruelling exercise regime Rachel and her husband Michael Miziner have for their kids. 'They aren't having fun working out with their bats*** crazy mother on Christmas morning, that's for sure. 'Get a life and stop trying to ride on the tailcoats [sic] of a long forgotten title that, in the modern day, holds virtually no relevance as compared to 20 years ago.' They then said the Miss Universe pageant title Rachael once competed for is now seen as 'irrelevant, chauvinistic and boastful'. The message also took aim at her 2010 stint on Dancing With The Stars, saying the competition show was just 'satire'. 'Don't you get it? We're laughing at you, not for you. All of your accomplishments are decades old now,' they said. Rachael appeared to take the horrific and lengthy message in her stride, saying she 'felt sad' for the troll as they were 'clearly going through a lot of hurt'. 'But overarching this is a perfect example of why we need to teach our kids inner strength and resilience,' she added. Rachael said 'there is nothing more important' than teaching children how to 'believe in themselves' and 'back themselves' in the face of adversity. 'To recognise only their opinion matters and they do not need outside validation to determine who they are,' she said. Rachael finished the video by encouraging her followers to be a strong 'support base' for their children so they can build their confidence."

The smartest brands are building partnerships that transform entire supply chains. Here's what's actually moving the needle H&M + Syre + Gap + Target = Circular Coalition What started as H&M's textile recycling venture just became fashion's first cross-competitor alliance. • Gap committed to 10,000+ tonnes annually • Target joined as anchor partner • Competitors sharing infrastructure to scale recycling When rivals become partners on sustainability, the whole industry shifts. Amazon + Rebag = Luxury Resale Goes Prime 30,000+ authenticated pre-owned Hermès, Rolex, Cartier items now ship with Prime speed. • Rebag handles authentication • Amazon provides infrastructure • Both split the massive market opportunity Partnership math: Expertise × Distribution = Category Domination Kering + Vestiaire Collective = Brand-Controlled Resale Kering invested €178M and integrated resale directly into brand sites. • Gucci customers can now sell back through official channels • Brands control pricing, authentication, and customer data • Revenue share model keeps profits in-house Smart brands don't fight resale — they partner to own it. SHEIN + Third-Party Recyclers = Greenwashing or Genius? After emissions jumped 170%, SHEIN announced partnerships with: • Circ for textile-to-textile recycling • Queen of Raw for deadstock marketplace • Multiple ""circular innovation labs"" Real question: Can partnerships fix a broken business model? Lululemon + Samsara Eco = 10-Year Material Security Not a pilot. Not a test. A decade-long commitment to enzymatically recycled materials. • Locked in 20% of future material needs • Fixed pricing in volatile market • Exclusive access to next-gen recycling tech The new partnership currency isn't cash — it's material security. The Partnership Principles That Matter Now: Infrastructure > Innovation The best partnerships share costs and scale solutions Competitors > Suppliers Your biggest rival might be your best sustainability partner Long-term > Short-term 10-year deals beat 10-month pilots Control > Outsource Own the customer relationship, even in partnerships Why this matters: Sustainability is too expensive to solve alone. The brands winning aren't going solo — they're building coalitions, sharing infrastructure, and turning competitors into collaborators. The old model: Compete on everything The new model: Compete on products, partner on planet TL;DR: H&M brought competitors into recycling. Amazon brought luxury resale to Prime. Kering brought resale in-house. And lululemon locked materials for a decade. The future isn't built alone...."

How we test the Oura Ring 4 Oura Ring 4: The Verdict More Oura Ring savings in the Amazon Prime Day sale Everything you need to know about the Oura Ring 4: In the boxOne size-specific charger and a USB-C cable.MaterialNon-allergenic titanium.Width7.90mm.Weight3.3 to 5.2 grams, depending on ring size.Water resistantUp to 100m/328 ft.Battery lifeUp to 8 days of battery, and typically charges in 20 to 80 minutes.ConnectivityBluetooth Low Energy. iOS and Android compatible. Arguably, the Oura Ring is one of the most sophisticated wellbeing monitors to date, measuring more than 20 biometrics that all directly impact how you feel, including heart rate variability (HRV), blood oxygen levels and temperature. For those concerned about accuracy, the finger actually provides the most accurate reading of your heart rate, blood oxygen levels and temperature. Plus, the brand's ongoing testing has measured the device to have a 79% sleep tracking accuracy, compared to clinical polysomnography at 83%. Need a tad more convincing? It also reported a 98% heart rate variability accuracy when compared to ECG2. Wondering how exactly it measures those metrics, though? Through a quartet of monitors: Red and infrared LEDsMeasure blood oxygen levels while you sleep.Green and infrared LEDsAlternate to measure heart rate and heart rate variability 24/7 and respiration rate during your sleep.Digital sensorMeasures your temperature variations.AccelerometerTracks movement and activity 24/7. But because a load of numbers and percentages aren't hugely helpful to those without a doctorate, it then shares its findings via the clear and concise Oura app in easy-to-digest graphics tables. This does mean you will need to sign up for an Oura Ring membership, but for just £5.99 a month or £69.99 a year, you'll also get tailored recommendations on how to up your scores. What are the differences between the Oura Ring Gen3 and the Oura Ring 4? First, the design and material. While the previous model had a titanium exterior surrounding an epoxy interior, the new iteration is made from lightweight, durable titanium the entire way through. The latter also comes fitted with recessed sensors, aiding a more comfortable fit and improved tracking. Talking of, the accuracy of the Oura Ring 4 is powered by Smart Sensing that dynamically selects the optimal signal path. In terms of battery life, designers claimed the Gen3 could last a whole seven days, while you now get up to eight days of uninterrupted tracking per charge with the 4. How we test the Oura Ring 4: Georgia Trodd wearing the Oura Ring 4 in gold. It's no secret that GLAMOUR editors often moonlight as testing guinea pigs. Over 12 weeks, various team members were asked to call into question the many claims made by the Oura Ring design team and consider the following: Ease of use — Was the app intuitive to use, and were your results easy to understand? Design — Did the ring feel big, bulky, heavy or get in the way? Any signs of wear and tear after 12 weeks? Waterproof — Any issues when worn in the bath, shower or while getting sweaty in the gym? Effectiveness — Did the personalised insights and recommendations make a difference to your health and/or wellbeing? Oura Ring 4: The Verdict We're still very much in the honeymoon period of our health tracking — AKA Oura needs a few more weeks of data to properly notice any patterns. However, our team of testers have pulled together a list of perks so far. There were no complaints in terms of comfort, many commenting how they forgot they were even wearing it, most days. And the response was the same when it came to design — many complimented how seamlessly it sat alongside their jewellery. One did point out that the gold is a little more yellow than most gold-plated bracelets and rings on the high street, but this is barely noticeable from a distance. ProsConsBattery lasts up to eight days, depending on activity level, and recharges super quickly in under two hours.There can be some tracking teething issues in those first few months — for example, mis-reading drying your hair as a workout.Offers you trends over time, giving you daily, weekly and monthly calendar views of your key body metrics.Rest Mode automatically switches on when Oura detects that your body might be under stress.Super aesthetic and plenty of colour options.

Email tips@dailymail.com Kim Kardashian went back to her fashion roots as she wore a second block colour latex dress and quirky boots from controversial designer Balenciaga as she arrived for their show in Paris on Wednesday. Ahead of the brand's show in the French capital the businesswoman, 44, stepped out in a full white look including the designer's classic long heeled boots - after wearing a similar pink outfit while out on Tuesday night. It comes after back in 2022 the brand sparked outrage with an ad showing kids posing alongside various BDSM-themed items. Two years later in 2024 Kim was named as one of their new brand ambassadors. She previously starred in Balenciaga campaigns, walked in their show and accompanied former creative director Demna Gvasalia to the 2021 Met Gala. On Wednesday ahead of the show - which was also attended by newly-single Katy Perry, Lauren Sanchez and Salma Hayek - she turned heads in the white number, which she teamed with oversized dark sunglasses. The star had hair clips attached to her raven tresses as she brought back the trend. The mum-of-four cut a serious figure and failed to raise a smile as she climbed out of her chauffer-driven car and headed inside for the fitting. The fitting was presumably in preparation for Balenciaga's Paris Fashion week show on Wednesday. Last January Kim was named as Balenciaga's new brand ambassador - one year after the brand sparked outrage with an ad showing kids posing alongside various BDSM-themed items. The reality star, who previously refused to cut ties with the brand but said she was 'shaken and disgusted' by the advert, posted a statement announcing her partnership with the label under its then creative director Demna. The statement read: 'For several years now, Balenciaga's designs have been a part of my many looks – and some of my most iconic fashion moments. 'This historic fashion house embraces modernity, craftsmanship and takes an innovative approach to design under Demna. 'For me, this long-standing relationship is built on mutual trust and a commitment to doing what's right. I'm excited about this next chapter for the brand and to become their ambassador.' Back in November 2022, the fashion house came under fierce fire after it released an ad that showed kids posing alongside various BDSM-themed items. Kim initially faced backlash for refusing to cut ties with the brand and praising the way it handled the scandal, despite her claiming to be 'shaken' and 'disgusted' by the images. Since then, she has made her loyalty clear by participating in an ad for Balenciaga's upcoming Summer 2024 collection. Clearly embarrassed by their ill-judged campaign, Balenciaga took the drastic step of wiping its social media pages clean after the controversy. 'I have been quiet for the past few days, not because I haven't been shocked and outraged by the recent Balenciaga campaigns, but because I wanted an opportunity to speak to their team to understand for myself how this could have happened,' the Los Angeles-born celebrity said in a statement on her Instagram page at the time. She continued: 'As a mother of four, I have been shaken by those disturbing images. The safety of children must be held with the highest regard and anything against it should have no place in our society - period.' She subsequently reissued the statement that saw some of the wording changed using stronger language adding: 'any attempts to normalize child abuse of any kind should have no place in our society - period.' However, on balance, Kardashian said at the time that she was comfortable with how the company reacted to the scandal. 'I appreciate Balenciaga's removal of the campaigns and apology. In speaking with them, I believe they understand the seriousness of the issue and will take the necessary measures for this to never happen again.' In an additional post, to both Instagram and Twitter, Kardashian said she was reconsidering her relationship with the fashion brand but had not yet many any firm decisions. 'As for my future with Balenciaga, I am currently re-evaluating my relationship with the brand, basing it off their willingness to accept accountability for something that should have never happened to begin with -- & the actions I am expecting to see them take to protect children.' She was famously introduced to Balenciaga Creative Director Demna by her ex, Kanye West with the couple's daughters also sporting the brand too. She acknowledged the role her ex-husband had played in the relationship in December 2021 as she spoke at the People's Choice Awards where she accepted an award for fashion. 'To Kanye, for really introducing me to the fashion world,' she said. ' I fell in love with fashion and I'm so inspired by so many people. But again, this is like a dream that I get to wake up and wear these amazing clothes and try new things and take a risk. I'm so humbled.' At the time, Vogue described it as 'the peak of Kardashian's Balenciaga moment.' Balenciaga is owned by Kering; the corporation also owns Gucci, Alexander McQueen, Bottega Veneta, Yves Saint Laurent and Creed. On Twitter at the time, users appeared skeptical of Kardashian's statement at the time with many suggesting only a complete the complete cutting of ties from the brand would be appropriate. Balenciaga publicly apologized and announced that it will be swiping off the ad from all of its social media profiles. 'We sincerely apologize for any offense our holiday campaign may have caused. Our plush bear bags should not have been featured with children in this campaign. 'We have immediately removed the campaign from all platforms,' the high-end luxury house shared on Instagram."

As major fashion houses unveil their most ambitious collections, the fashion capital is also turning into an open-air museum. From Worth to Chanel, exceptional exhibitions immerse visitors in the history, reinventions, and artistic experiences surrounding couture. Here are the must-see events of the season. 1. Worth. Inventing Haute Couture This exhibition, presented by the Palais Galliera in collaboration with the Petit Palais, pays tribute to Charles Frederick Worth, the British designer considered the father of haute couture. In the late 19th century, Worth revolutionized fashion by putting his name on his creations, working on commission, and customizing pieces for individual clients. The exhibition reveals spectacular gowns, archival sketches, and rare documents tracing the birth of the haute couture system as we know it today. A must-see to understand the roots of Parisian luxury. The exhibition “Worth. Inventing Haute Couture” is open until September 7 at the Petit Palais, Avenue Winston Churchill, 75008 Paris. 2. Balenciaga by Demna On Wednesday, July 9, Demna will unveil his latest FW26 collection for Balenciaga, the house he has led as artistic director since 2015. He will officially leave the role the following day, July 10, to join Gucci, a move announced back in March. To mark the occasion, Balenciaga is dedicating an exhibition at the Kering headquarters. Sculptural silhouettes, extreme volumes, and unconventional materials tell the story of how Demna has deconstructed and reimagined couture through a critical lens since 2015. A powerful tribute to innovation that resonates with the house's groundbreaking shows. The exhibition “Balenciaga by Demna” is open until July 9 at Kering headquarters, 40 rue de Sèvres, 75007 Paris. 3. Paul Poiret. Fashion is a Party The Musée des Arts Décoratifs is devoting a major retrospective to Paul Poiret, a legendary early 20th-century designer. By freeing women from corsets, exploring fluid cuts and Oriental inspirations, Poiret revolutionized the female silhouette. His love of parties, exotic settings, and rich textiles shines through in an immersive scenography. Evening gowns, sumptuous coats, and original edition perfumes reflect the boldness of a man who saw fashion as total art. This iconic Belle Époque designer inspired the likes of Christian Dior and Alphonse Maitrepierre. The exhibition “Paul Poiret. Fashion is a Party” is open until January 11, 2026, at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs (MAD), 107 rue de Rivoli, 75001 Paris. 4. The New Rotation at Galerie Dior This retrospective gathers 150 designs with original sketches, archives, and photographs, showcasing Dior's rich heritage and the timelessness of its modernity. Through thirteen themes, the exhibition explores the house's universe: from a love of gardens to the magic of balls, from the creative freedom of the Miss Dior line to the artisanal excellence of haute couture workshops. It also offers an immersive experience in the Room of Wonders, designed as a cabinet of curiosities, and highlights Dior's iconic elegance and the captivating aura of J'Adore. Galerie Dior, 11 rue François-Ier, 75008 Paris. Open from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m., closed on Tuesdays. Last entry at 5:30 p.m. 5. Moda Povera V: Renée's Clothes Olivier Saillard, fashion historian and performer, pays tribute to his mother Renée by transforming her wardrobe into a haute couture collection, blending fashion and memory in a moving performance. Halfway between a happening and an exhibition, this fifth edition of the Moda Povera project invites us to rethink clothing as an intimate, political, and poetic gesture. In a deliberately simple staging, it reconciles a poetic vision of fashion with independence from the luxury system, while delivering an extremely personal and emotional performance in honor of his mother, a taxi driver and part-time seamstress. The exhibition “Moda Povera V. Renée's Clothes” is open from July 10 to 13 at the Grand Palais, Galerie 2, Gabrielle Chanel entrance, Avenue Winston Churchill, 75008 Paris."

Email tips@dailymail.com Ben Hardy couldn't keep his hands off actress Emilia Jones as the pair confirmed their romance at BST Hyde Park over the weekend. The former EastEnders star, 34, who played Peter Beale from 2013 until 2015, packed on the PDA with the CODA actress, 23, over the weekend. Ben and Emilia were spotted together at American Express presents BST in Hyde Park where Sabrina Carpenter was headlining on Sunday. The Bohemian Rhapsody star was all over the actress, passionately kissing and holding her as they queued for drinks in the VIP garden. An insider told The Sun: 'Ben couldn't keep his hands off her and was trying to kiss her at almost any opportunity. 'She didn't seem to object and was all smiles.' Emilia looked stylish as she stepped out in a black racer neck cropped top with low-rise bootleg jeans and a gold Gucci belt, as well as a pair of chunky boots. Meanwhile Ben kept it casual in a pair of knee-length denim shorts, a red tartan shirt and Converse trainers. The new romance comes over two years after he parted ways from his fellow EastEnders ex Jessica Plummer after going public with their relationship back in 2021. The former soap actors were said to have fallen victim to busy work schedules, leading to them 'growing apart'. According to The Mirror, sources close to Ben and Jessica claimed at the time that the pair had been too busy to keep the relationship afloat. One insider shared: 'Ben and Jessica were besotted with each other but work has meant they spent a lot of time apart.' 'Over time it's taken its toll and recently they decided to call it a day,' they continued. The split came after it appeared they were still going strong in the summer of 2022 when they celebrated Ben's 31st birthday six months late with a holiday to Turkey. Ben and Jessica are both EastEnders alumni, with the latter portraying Chantelle Atkins from 2019 until 2022. The couple then starred alongside one another for four-part BBC drama The Girl Before, growing close as they portrayed on-screen couple Simon and Emma. After months of circulating rumours, they confirmed the romance shortly after appearing in the drama with a PDA display in central London. Embracing one another near a taxi after a night with pals at Soho House, the couple were snapped looking ultra cosy. Ben and Jessica's relationship came shortly after it was reported that he had split from his ex-girlfriend Olivia Cooke earlier that year, with sources claiming at the time their romance 'fizzled out.' After saying goodbye to Albert Square, Ben has bagged numerous roles in films and shows including Mary Shelley, Only The Brave, 6 Underground and The Woman In White. His soap character Peter had a tumultuous time in Albert Square in the last couple of years, most notably with his sister Lucy being murdered by their brother Bobby. Peter left the Square for a new life in New Zealand, with his ex Lauren Branning eventually joining him with their son Louie. Ben then went on to star in Hollywood films such as Bohemian Rhapsody and X-Men: Apocalypse. Bohemian Rhapsody won four of the five Academy Awards it was nominated for. The film also grossed more than $900million worldwide."

Based in Toronto, Canada, European Boutique operates four multi-brand luxury watch and jewellery stores at Yorkdale, Square One, the Toronto Eaton Centre and Sherway Gardens malls. It also manages three mono-brand boutiques for OMEGA, Breitling and Montblanc, alongside integrated storefronts for brands such as TAG Heuer, GUCCI and Diamonds Direct. In addition to its physical stores, European runs a national e-commerce platform at European.ca, offering a wide range of watches and jewellery across Canada. Birks Group has secured a licensing agreement to operate the Canadian brand Diamonds Direct. To finance the acquisition, Birks Group has obtained $13.5m incremental loan from SLR Credit Solutions, one of its existing senior lenders. Part of the loan proceeds funded the acquisition, with the remainder allocated to ordinary course working capital. This incremental loan has interest at the same rate as the existing $12.5m term loan with SLR. Birks Group has also entered into a $3.75m loan agreement with Mangrove Holding, one of the controlling shareholders of Birks Group. The loan carries an annual interest rate of 15% and is repayable in full by 24 December 2026. These funds will also support ordinary course working capital. Birks Group remains focused on pursuing strategic goals, including exploring further transactions to raise additional capital through public or private equity, debt financing or the completion of strategic acquisitions. Birks Group president and CEO Jean-Christophe Bédos stated: “We are delighted to complete the acquisition of European. “The European stores have prime locations in important malls in the Greater Toronto Area and carry high-end luxury brands which will complement Birks Group's offering. “We now enter into a period of transition where we will be liaising closely with the European team and we look forward to welcoming Jordan Sutkiewicz, Michelle Ceresney and European's employees to the Birks family.” "" "" was originally created and published by Retail Insight Network, a GlobalData owned brand."

While they struggle to catch up, we remain focused, protected, and ahead. May God continue to bless their name and open their eyes to truth. I now explain why my experiences do not rely solely on fiat currency. I design my own experiences with my paper—physical, handwritten, and created with intention. The true value is not in numbers or digital balances, but in presence. My presence, my work, and my creativity are what hold value. Everything I create is real, rooted in physical places with real human interaction. My experiences are geotagged and timestamped before they ever touch social media. These moments are recorded on the map, verified through time and location, not filtered or manipulated through artificial systems. This is why I continue to monitor my experiences in real time—front end and back end—because I know the value lies in authenticity, not algorithm. May God continue to be phenomenal. May God continue to bless the nation. I'm MS.ELIJHA®, and I approve this message.

mov_8E21A7B6C2C10FEDA02749C3F02111D4,2025-07-09 13:11:15,en,WEB,"  We know — our dining coverage has been patchy lately. But we're back in the game. Here's a quick look at the openings that stood out in 2025 so far, plus a heads up: our monthly Where We're Eating & Drinking column is coming back, too. Spanish food: Atica, Ocean's Table - both have spanish menus with different angles of spanish food and completely different styles. Bars: Nora's Wine Shop & Bar, Penicillin - new spots for wine and cocktails that show two different sides of Shanghai nightlife. Pop ups: Nono's - a fun concept that opened in April and is back with a test kitchen at different F&B spots around the city. Special mentions: A few new fine dining places, a Japanese omakase, new places in the PAC, and some luxury label cafés. ática This will be Bottega group's fourth restaurant in Shanghai and third restaurant off of Xiangyang. Ática is a Spanish tapas restaurant from the Bottega and Forno team (Beijing), on the rooftop terrace of the Basement FG mansion just off Xiangyang Park (Xiangyang Bei Lu and Xinle Lu). The menu, made by Ferran Edo Andreu (also of Ocean's Table), has traditional Spanish tapas with dishes like olive and anchovy skewers with pickled Navarra piparra (58rmb), confit piquillo peppers with toasted peanuts (38rmb), and three kinds of patatas (48–58rmb). There's even flan (48rmb). The patio was built for long afternoons and summer nights: a full gin & tonic menu (16), eight types of sangria, and classic cocktails. DJs every weekend, and live flamenco on most. Atica seems like its designed to feel familiar to anyone who's spent time in Spain. Expect a wait or book ahead. penicillin Hong Kong's Penicillin (ranked #24 on Asia's 50 Best Bars), now has a Shanghai outpost. It's not here to serve your usual gin and tonic or whiskey sour. Opened in April, this is the spot for drinkers who want to be surprised. Expect cocktails with ingredients like fermented rice water, grilled red cabbage soda, or rotovap waste shell vodka. Drinks are split into fermented cocktails (88rmb), mocktails (75rmb), with 15 cocktails (90rmb), some exclusive to the Shanghai menu. The space is photo-friendly: glass-top tables with succulents, a tree in the center of the entryway, and a frozen (or heated) bar panel depending on the season. There's also a VIP room with no minimum spend. As the founders Agung Prabowo and Laura (originally from Indonesia) say, ""Everyone is VIP."" Sustainability is core to Penicillin: no coasters, plenty of ingredient upcycling, and a tree planted in Indonesia for every drink sold. Come curious, leave buzzed. Ocean's Table Ocean's Table opened in early June in the old Commune Social space. While its predecessor was modern fusion, Ocean's Table leans more contemporary Spanish. The interior still feels familiar: a sleek, two-story layout with the wraparound open kitchen bar and — thankfully — that leafy garden patio intact. Spanish chef Ferran Edo Andreu leads with a seafood-forward lineup, plus wagyu and vegetarian plates. Brunch runs Friday to Sunday, 11am–2pm, with set menus (268–398rmb) that include coffee and optional sangria. Dinner is à la carte, tapas-style, with mains topping out at 288rmb. Cocktails are between 58–98rmb, with a full wine list for when things go long. The upstairs bar seats about eight and leads to a small rooftop where you can take your drink and unwind. With its flexible layout, Ocean's Table works for a date, a group dinner, or solo time at the bar with a plate of croquettes and a glass of sangria. Bizy Boy Don't let the sandwich fame fool you: Bizy Boy is running a full, chef-driven menu. They opened in March and quickly made waves online for the above-mentioned, lunch-time only, pastrami sandwich. Chef Jeremy's menu includes house-made pastas like scallop mousse ravioli with black tiger prawn (128rmb), and rigatoni with scallop, spicy tomato, and vodka sauce (138rmb). You'll also find beetroot-apple soda (35rmb) and marinated mushrooms with burrata (98rmb). The food might read upscale, but the space keeps things casual and fun. Colorful interiors, collabs with brands like Bloom Coffee, and events like their recent block party with Franklin (Next Bottle, Nono's), where they turned the pastrami sandwich into a taco, makes this place more like a neighborhood restaurant. Come for the sandwich, stay for the menu. Nono's Nono's is a semi-elusive pop-up concept fromthe Yaya's boys, Chef Chris Zhu (Blaz), and Franklin from Next Bottle. It started as a cheeky offshoot of Yaya's but has evolved into something more refined and experimental. No spicy egg yolk pappardelle or Sichuan eggplant here. Instead, it's a blend of Italian and Chinese.Think squid spaghetti with xuecai (118rmb) and Bone Marrow (108rmb)...."

Arnold Jerocki/Save this storySaveSave this storySave In April, Emma Watson turned 35 years old. She also celebrated more than five years away from the movies: the last time we saw her on the big screen was in Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Little Women, released back in 2019. Though Watson has been largely away from the spotlight since then, she has kept busy. Watson started an MA in creative writing at Oxford University in 2023; according to the Daily Mail, university life captivates her so much that she also started a PhD program this year. Perhaps Watson is making up for lost time. When she finished secondary school, she was unable to immediately enter university because she was committed to filming the last two installments of the Harry Potter saga. She took a gap year, then enrolled at Brown University to study English literature. Watson graduated in five years instead of four because she had to take two whole semesters off to film projects like My Week with Marilyn, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Bling Ring, This Is the End, and Noah. This time around, she has taken a complete hiatus from her film career so that it does not interfere with her education. But this is not the only reason she has stepped away from the movies. “I think I felt a bit caged,” Watson told the Financial Times in the spring of 2023, shortly before starting her master's degree. “The thing I found really hard was that I had to go out and sell something that I really didn't have very much control over. To stand in front of a film and have every journalist be able to say, 'How does this align with your viewpoint?' It was very difficult to have to be the face and the spokesperson for things where I didn't get to be involved in the process.” A few months later, in December 2023, she admitted to the British edition of Vogue that she was grateful for the respite she had taken. “I'm just so glad that I did [step away from acting] because I have this feeling of having my own voice and creative space and sovereignty in some way that I don't think I did before – more autonomy,” she said. “I'm so glad that I allowed things to be messy for a minute and to really allow myself to not know [what's next], because the knowing that I've come to, I wouldn't trade that for anything.” Watson used that creative space, to make her directorial debut in 2022 with a short film for Prada Beauty's Paradoxe fragrance campaign; she also wrote the script and acted in it. In 2024, Watson became the face of Prada's Re-Nylon collection, made solely from nylon taken from the recycling and purification of plastic collected from the sea. Emma Watson has been committed to sustainable fashion since she was a teenager. In 2009 she was already linked as a creative advisor to People Tree, one of the pioneers of ethical fashion. In 2020 she joined the board of directors of People Tree. That same year, she also joined the board of directors of Kering, the luxury conglomerate that encompasses firms such as Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, to lead its sustainability committee. Watson was its youngest member at the time. She left the position in 2023, when she returned to university. That year Watson also began a new and novel business venture alongside her younger brother, Alex, with whom she is very close. (He also has a background in fashion; in 2010, he starred in a campaign for Burberry with his sister.) Watson launched her own French-style gin, Renais, recalling her roots: Watson was born and lived near Paris until her parents divorced when she was five years old. The gin is made with sustainability in mind, and is very much anchored in the Watsons' family history. Their father, Chris, has owned vineyards in the Chablis region of Burgundy since the early nineties, and the siblings spent long periods of their childhood there, even participating in the grape harvest. Similar grapes are key to the character of this premium gin. Instagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. “To me, Renais is a family project; the Chablis region evokes very special memories of growing up. I've loved having the opportunity to create something with my brother Alex,” Watson said via a statement published in Wine Spectator. “I'm particularly proud of upcycling grapes from vineyards, including my dad's, to reduce waste and create something new.” The packaging is also sustainable. Watson has personally been in charge of the artistic design of its special editions, as she has shown her more than 73 million Instagram followers. The project is going so well that she and Alex recently received an investment of 5.8 million euros for the international expansion of Renais into more than a dozen countries, including the United States and Spain, where you can already find the gin in specialty stores. The fiercely private Watson does not share her university life on her social networks, but the Daily Mail recently photographed her taking part in one of Oxford's great traditions: acting as coxswain on a women's rowing team. The week before, the same tabloid reported on an alleged lakeside picnic date Watson had with a fellow student. Her last known relationship was with Brandon Green, son of businessman Sir Philip Green—although, again according to the Daily Mail, they broke up in 2023 after just over a year and a half together. Watson has always been very proud of her independence, and in fact coined the term “self-partnered.” The big question is when we will see Watson in the movies again. She reiterated to Vogue last year that her hiatus is not a retirement, and that in the future she sees herself acting in projects that she directs, writes and/or produces. She also remains close to the industry, as evidenced by her surprise appearance at the Cannes Film Festival in May, an event she hasn't attended since presenting Sofia Coppola's The Bling Ring in 2013. The Oxford Mail recently speculated that she is being considered to be the next Bond girl, a role that does not seem to fit precisely with her roadmap. But with a prestigious director like Denis Villeneuve attached to the project, who knows?..."

mov_76C7A12CE32EFCFA382A3EA10CC83FC0,2025-07-09 15:11:44,en,WEB,"  Have YOU got a story? Email tips@dailymail.com Vittoria Ceretti turned heads as she attended the Balenciaga Haute Couture Fall/Winter 2025/2026 show as part of Paris Fashion Week on Wednesday. The Italian fashion model, 27, looked nothing short of sensational in a sophisticated black blazer, featuring satin lapels and a deeply plunging neckline. Vittoria showcased her natural beauty with minimal makeup, appearing in high spirits as she smiled and waved for the cameras ahead of the show. The beauty, who is currently dating Leonardo DiCaprio, was also joined by her pal, Fai Khadra, 33, who cut a casual figure in a black hoody and sported clear glasses. Model Fai has previously been linked to various celebrities in the past including Kendall Jenner and Bella Hadid. He is currently known for his close friendship with the Jenner sisters and for his multifaceted career as a model, architect, designer, and musician. Back in November 2022, the fashion house came under fierce fire after it released an ad that showed kids posing alongside various BDSM-themed items. Brand ambassador Kim Kardashian, 44, initially faced backlash for refusing to cut ties with the brand and praising the way it handled the scandal, despite her claiming to be 'shaken' and 'disgusted' by the images. Since then, she has made her loyalty clear by participating in an ad for Balenciaga's Summer 2024 collection. Clearly embarrassed by their ill-judged campaign, Balenciaga took the drastic step of wiping its social media pages clean after the controversy. 'I have been quiet for the past few days, not because I haven't been shocked and outraged by the recent Balenciaga campaigns, but because I wanted an opportunity to speak to their team to understand for myself how this could have happened,' the Los Angeles-born celebrity said in a statement on her Instagram page at the time. She continued: 'As a mother of four, I have been shaken by those disturbing images. The safety of children must be held with the highest regard and anything against it should have no place in our society - period.' She subsequently reissued the statement that saw some of the wording changed using stronger language adding: 'Any attempts to normalize child abuse of any kind should have no place in our society - period.' However, on balance, Kim said at the time that she was comfortable with how the company reacted to the scandal. 'I appreciate Balenciaga's removal of the campaigns and apology. In speaking with them, I believe they understand the seriousness of the issue and will take the necessary measures for this to never happen again.' In an additional post, to both Instagram and Twitter, Kim said she was reconsidering her relationship with the fashion brand but had not made any firm decisions. 'As for my future with Balenciaga, I am currently re-evaluating my relationship with the brand, basing it off their willingness to accept accountability for something that should have never happened to begin with -- & the actions I am expecting to see them take to protect children.' She was famously introduced to Balenciaga Creative Director Demna by her ex, Kanye West with the couple's daughters also sporting the brand too. She acknowledged the role her ex-husband had played in the relationship in December 2021 as she spoke at the People's Choice Awards where she accepted a fashion award. 'To Kanye, for really introducing me to the fashion world,' she said. ' I fell in love with fashion and I'm so inspired by so many people. But again, this is like a dream that I get to wake up and wear these amazing clothes and try new things and take a risk. I'm so humbled.' At the time, Vogue described it as 'the peak of Kardashian's Balenciaga moment.' Balenciaga is owned by Kering; the corporation also owns Gucci, Alexander McQueen, Bottega Veneta, Yves Saint Laurent and Creed. On Twitter at the time, users appeared sceptical of Kim's statement, with many suggesting only a complete cutting of ties from the brand would be appropriate. Balenciaga publicly apologized and announced that it would be swiping off the ad from all of its social media profiles. 'We sincerely apologize for any offence our holiday campaign may have caused. Our plush bear bags should not have been featured with children in this campaign. 'We have immediately removed the campaign from all platforms,' the high-end luxury house shared on Instagram."

mov_5E5968111AADB1F126EBA68B6D602D7F,2025-07-09 16:16:14,en,WEB,"  In April, Emma Watson turned 35 years old. She also celebrated more than five years away from the movies: The last time we saw her on the big screen was in Greta Gerwig's adaptation of Little Women, released back in 2019. Though Watson has been largely away from the spotlight since then, she has kept busy. She started an MA in creative writing at Oxford University in 2023; according to the Daily Mail, university life captivates her so much that she also started a PhD program this year. Perhaps Watson is making up for lost time. When she finished secondary school, she didn't immediately enter university because she was committed to filming the last two installments of the Harry Potter series. She took a gap year, then enrolled at Brown University to study English. Watson graduated in five years instead of four because she took two semesters off to film projects like My Week With Marilyn, The Perks of Being a Wallflower, The Bling Ring, This Is the End, and Noah. This time around, she has taken a complete hiatus from her film career so that it does not interfere with her education. But this is not the only reason she has stepped away from the movies. “I think I felt a bit caged,” Watson told the Financial Times in the spring of 2023, shortly before starting her master's degree. “The thing I found really hard was that I had to go out and sell something that I really didn't have very much control over. To stand in front of a film and have every journalist be able to say, 'How does this align with your viewpoint?' It was very difficult to have to be the face and the spokesperson for things where I didn't get to be involved in the process.” Some months later, in December 2023, she admitted to the British edition of Vogue that she was grateful for the respite she had taken. “I'm just so glad that I did [step away from acting] because I have this feeling of having my own voice and creative space and sovereignty in some way that I don't think I did before—more autonomy,” she said. “I'm so glad that I allowed things to be messy for a minute and to really allow myself to not know [what's next], because the knowing that I've come to, I wouldn't trade that for anything.” Watson used that creative space to make her directorial debut in 2022 with a short film for Prada Beauty's Paradoxe fragrance campaign; she also wrote the script and acted in it. In 2024, Watson became the face of Prada's Re-Nylon collection, made solely from nylon taken from the recycling and purification of plastic collected from the sea. Watson has been committed to sustainable fashion since she was a teenager. In 2009, she was already linked as a creative adviser to People Tree, one of the pioneers of ethical fashion. In 2020, she joined its board of directors. That same year, she also joined the board of directors of Kering, the luxury conglomerate that encompasses Gucci and Yves Saint Laurent, to lead its sustainability committee. Watson was its youngest member at the time. She left the position in 2023, upon returning to school. That year Watson also began a new and novel business venture alongside her younger brother, Alex, with whom she is close. (He also has a background in fashion; in 2010, he starred in a campaign for Burberry with his sister.) Watson launched her own French-style gin, Renais, recalling her roots: She was born and lived near Paris until her parents divorced when she was five years old. The gin is made with sustainability in mind, and is very much anchored in the Watsons' family history. Their father, Chris, has owned vineyards in the Chablis region of Burgundy since the early '90s, and the siblings spent long periods of their childhood there, even participating in the grape harvest. Similar grapes are key to the character of this premium gin. Instagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from. “To me, Renais is a family project; the Chablis region evokes very special memories of growing up. I've loved having the opportunity to create something with my brother Alex,” Watson said via a statement published in Wine Spectator. “I'm particularly proud of upcycling grapes from vineyards, including my dad's, to reduce waste and create something new.” The packaging is also sustainable. Watson has personally been in charge of the artistic design of its special editions, as she has shown her 73 million Instagram followers. The project is going so well that she and Alex recently received an investment of 5.8 million euros for the international expansion of Renais into more than a dozen countries, including the United States and Spain, where you can already find the gin in specialty stores. The fiercely private Watson does not share her university life on her social networks, but the Daily Mail recently photographed her taking part in one of Oxford's great traditions: acting as coxswain on a women's rowing team. The week before, the same tabloid reported on an alleged lakeside picnic date Watson had with a fellow student. Her last known relationship was with Brandon Green, son of businessman Sir Philip Green—although, again according to the Daily Mail, they broke up in 2023 after just over a year and a half together. Watson has always been proud of her independence, and in fact coined the term “self-partnered.” The big question is when we will see Watson in the movies again. She reiterated to Vogue last year that her hiatus is not a retirement, and that in the future she sees herself acting in projects that she directs, writes, and/or produces. She also remains close to the industry, as evidenced by her surprise appearance at the Cannes Film Festival in May, an event she hasn't attended since presenting Sofia Coppola's The Bling Ring in 2013. The Oxford Mail recently speculated that she is being considered to be the next Bond girl, a role that does not seem to fit precisely with her roadmap. But with a prestigious director like Denis Villeneuve attached to the project, who knows? Original story in VF Spain. The post appeared first on Vanity Fair."

Ce 9 juillet, en pleine Fashion Week de Paris, le directeur artistique Demna a présenté son ultime collection haute couture pour Balenciaga. La dernière avant de laisser les commandes de la griffe de luxe à l'italien Pierpaolo Piccioli (ex-Valentino), et prendre ses quartiers à la tête de la maison Gucci. Forcément, pour célébrer un tel moment qui met aussi un terme à l'interminable mercato de la mode, le styliste géorgien a fait appel à un panel impressionnant de célébrités, réunissant notamment au premier rang un bon nombre de stars qui ont participé, fin juin, au fastueux . En commençant par madame Bezos elle-même. Arrivée dans les premières au 10 avenue George V, l'épouse du patron d'Amazon a fait sensation au photocall du défilé dans un ensemble noir moulant, les cheveux attachés par un maxi-nœud de la même teinte, et le visage dissimulé derrière une imposante paire de lunettes de soleil, avant de s'installer sur une chaise dorée à la droite de Katy Perry. De son côté, si la chanteuse pop de 40 ans n'a pas assisté au mariage sensationnel du couple Bezos - contrairement à son ex-conjoint Orlando Bloom dont elle s'est séparée récemment -, elle a tout de même été présente à au mois de mai, organisé à Paris, avec Kris Jenner, Eva Longoria et Kim Kardashian. » LIRE AUSSI - Par ailleurs, Kim Kardashian a elle aussi été de la partie, ce 9 juillet. Non pas au front row, mais sur le podium. La femme d'affaires aux commandes de la marque de lingerie Skims a en effet fait l'honneur à Demna de défiler dans une robe nuisette en soie, lovée dans un imposant manteau de «vison» fait de plumes brodées. «Mon ode à Elizabeth Taylor [...] Pour compléter cet hommage, elle porte les boucles d'oreilles personnelles en diamant d'Elizabeth Taylor, provenant de la collection privée de Lorraine Schwartz», a rappelé un communiqué rédigé par le couturier au sujet de ce look. Une clientèle fidèle Si autant d'invités au «mariage du siècle» ont assisté à l'ultime show de Demna pour Balenciaga ce 9 juillet, à l'instar de Vittoria Ceretti (sans son compagnon Leonardo DiCaprio), c'est notamment car les proches du couple Bezos-Sanchez sont très fidèles à la maison de luxe. À l'image de Kim Kardashian qui a toujours été une solide cliente de Balenciaga par Demna, manquant rarement une occasion de faire honneur aux créations du couturier. Même chose pour Vittoria Ceretti : le mannequin italien a plus d'une fois porté du Balenciaga, et a même posé pour la campagne automne-hiver 2023 de la marque aux côtés d'Isabelle Huppert. Concernant Lauren Sanchez, l'ancienne journaliste de télévision a elle aussi plus d'une fois prouvé son attachement au travail de Demna, comme le 28 mars dernier en apparaissant avec le sac à main 9 AM Clutch de Balenciaga en forme de tasse à café en porcelaine blanche. Un accessoire qu'elle a d'ailleurs porté de nouveau, ce 9 juillet, lors de son arrivée au show, comme un dernier au revoir à cette maison qui, pendant toute l'ère Demna, a vu défiler les célébrités les plus bankables à chacun de ses événements."

n27t9ft,2025-07-09 17:56:24,en,REDDIT,"  I have thought the same on a few occassions, especially when I see influencers buying the Gucci baby bag or a Dior bag as a baby bag. Spending that much money on a baby bag is so unnecessary BUT each to their own and how they spend their money. I purchased a baby backpack from Amazon because I wanted two straps. It has so many good pockets, nice in depth, it was great for when we travelled to Japan. My tip for dirty items are to always keep some of the flimsy plastic bags used for buying loose vegetables and fruits at the supermarkets. They're free but thicker and bigger than doggy poop bags."

mov_FB940A8169020AD1D54FFADA4B7BED98,2025-07-09 18:50:17,en,WEB,"  My Amazon app is working overtime this week. From now until Friday, new Prime Day deals are popping up every minute. Thankfully, the Marie Claire team is only covering the best fashion deals, so I know which purchases are worth ordering for real. This morning, however, I was doing my own deep dive and came across a sale so shocking I thought Jeff Bezos was pranking me himself. Bella Hadid's now-signature Coach Brooklyn bag is on major markdown. That's right, the hobo bag she carried to It-item status is available for $282—43 percent off—instead of the usual $495. That's over $200 off a supermodel-worthy splurge. Hadid's black leather version is still full price, but I'm still considering it, too. (Once you buy one Coach bag, you'll buy them all—as Hadid's own designer bag collection can attest.) Coach Suede Brooklyn Shoulder Bag (Was $495) As of right now, Hadid owns the Brooklyn bag in two colors. She first debuted the spacious black best-seller in July 2024. Given its ""distinctly New York attitude,"" Hadid took it out and about in NYC. The ""Natural Grain Leather/Brass/Black"" version sold out instantly after Hadid paired it with vintage Gucci pants, as do most model-approved pieces. You may like Bella Hadid debuted the Coach Brooklyn bag alongside Gucci pants. (Image credit: ) A few hours later, the Brooklyn Bag reappeared on Hadid's shoulders, this time alongside a puff-sleeve blouse and capris. Once again, she chose the 39 model, which can fit a 15"" laptop, plus all of her essentials. Coach also offers a 28 option, which is also marked down for Prime Day from $295 to $206. Later that day, she returned to the street style scene with the Brooklyn back in tow. (Image credit: ) By August, Hadid already secured her second Brooklyn—the same 39 style in the Suede/Brass/Sand shade. Hadid curated denim shorts and vintage Dior cowboy boots to complement the bag's country-fied finish. The Brooklyn's gold hardware even matched her $6,500 diamond pinky ring from SHAY. In August, Bella was spotted with a new suede version, the same Brooklyn currently on sale. (Image credit: Backgrid) Like any devoted Coach connoisseur, the Orebella founder's collection is ever-expanding. Her newest addition is the Empire Carryall Bag 34 in patent leather. The glossy black glaze falls under the east-west bag trend and retails for $450. It's not currently on clearance for Prime Day, but Amazon may have a few tricks up its sleeve. In March 2025, Bella was spotted with the Empire Carryall in tow.

Email tips@dailymail.com Mia Regan looked stunning as she gave a sneak peek at her new collection with H&M on Wednesday. The model, 22, who split from from Romeo Beckham last year after five years together, modelled a shimmering bikini before changing into a fitted maxi dress. In a behind-the-scenes insight into her photoshoot with the brand in Australia, Mia shared a series of stunning photos to Instagram. Celebrating her clothing line, she partied on a boat wearing a brown dress with cut-out sides and ruched detailing. Mia captioned her post: 'I <3 Aus!! Thank you gals for celebrating my collection with h&m with me!! ❤️ next stop London… drops 17th July :)' Speaking to British Vogue about her collection, she explained: 'I've designed my dream summer wardrobe. It felt like a really good synergy.' Mia added: 'I've subconsciously been building up an archive of inspiration for my whole life.' She is currently dating Henry O'Sullivan and while Romeo moved on with Kim Turnbull - they have since split. It is not clear when exactly Mia and Henry started dating but he debuted her on his social media as early as October of last year. The Mail revealed that Romeo and Kim had gone their separate ways after seven months together, with friends saying that the romance 'fizzled out' three weeks after David's 50th birthday. Romeo first publicly launched his relationship with Kim last November after weeks of exchanging flirty 'likes' on Instagram however despite being warmly welcomed into the family, the relationship has now run its course. Friends told The Mail that things remain 'amicable' between Romeo and Kim, and that their parting is 'nothing to do' with Kim being blamed by Nicola Peltz for being the catalyst for the feud that has ripped the Beckham family apart. One said: 'Romeo and Kim are both young and they had a lovely time together but at that age things don't always last forever and they decided to split up. 'They have been friendly since and have even been at the same venues. It's a huge shame, particularly as David and Victoria really adored her and thought she made Romeo happy but it wasn't to be. 'It happened a couple of weeks ago and relations have remained friendly between them. 'David and Victoria would hate for the view to be that they split because of Nicola and Brooklyn because that simply isn't the case. 'The fact is that Kim has got a really busy career as a DJ and Romeo has a busy work life too, there is lots of travelling for both of them at having a relationship at this time isn't all that conducive to their lives.' Mia broke up with Romeo in February of last year after five years together. It is claimed the couple went their separate ways after an argument, with Mia moving out of the home they shared together. When Mia met Romeo at 16, she was a netball-loving sixth-former studying history, art and PE, with her sights on university. Her family lived close to the Beckhams' £12 million farmhouse in the Cotswolds and she and Romeo were first pictured together at Victoria's fashion show in 2019. But after making their relationship 'Instagram official', Mia was catapulted into the limelight. Thoughts of university were left behind as she began working with 50 of the world's top brands including Gucci, Prada, Coca-Cola and fashion house Celine."
mov_70DC41A1B95917FFF3CA5E4AFC599F80,2025-07-09 20:50:16,es,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[es]Esta es la cantidad de dinero que tiene el importante magnate francés Sin temor a equivocarnos, Salma Hayek es la celebridad mexicana más millonaria de todas, con una fortuna que rebasa los cientos de millones de dólares. Por supuesto, una magnate de su nivel está rodeada de personas que ostentan poderosas cifras en el banco. Una de estas personas, claro, es su esposo, François-Henri Pinault, famoso por ser la cabeza del conglomerado Kering, del que Salma también es parte. De nacionalidad francesa, François-Henri Pinault y Salma Hayek formalizaron su unión en 2009. El conglomerado que preside el empresario tiene bajo su gestión marcas que definen el sector del lujo, como Gucci, Saint Laurent y Balenciaga, las cuales han marcado tendencia no solo en Europa, sino también en mercados como el mexicano, donde gozan de gran reconocimiento entre los más ricos. El impacto de Kering bajo la dirección de Pinault ha sido transformador para la industria global de la moda y el lujo. Se estima que la fortuna de François-Henri Pinault, esposo de Salma Hayek, supera los 7 mil millones de dólares. El francés y la mexicana, juntos, son una de las parejas famosas más ricas de la historia. La solidez financiera no es la única cualidad de su relación, también el amor. Te contamos cómo se conocieron. Salma Hayek respondió a las acusaciones de “casarse por dinero” con François-Henri Pinault La historia que une a la actriz y al empresario comenzó en 2006, durante la inauguración del Palacio Grassi en Venecia. Desde esa noche, ambos mantuvieron una relación cercana que en 2007 culminó con el anuncio de su compromiso y la noticia de la llegada de su primera hija, Valentina Paloma, quien nació en septiembre de ese mismo año. Se casaron en una ceremonia íntima el 14 de febrero de 2009 en París, evento que más tarde complementaron con una boda religiosa realizada en Venecia en abril de ese año. Pese al poderío económico de ambos, se dice que la pareja optó por no firmar un acuerdo prenupcial. Según la revista Forbes, tanto Salma Hayek como François-Henri Pinault, mantienen sus finanzas por separado. La propia Hayek ha señalado en entrevistas que su objetivo es construir una fortuna propia, independiente de la herencia o los negocios familiares. En una declaración concedida al Wall Street Journal, expresó: “Estoy 'en una misión' para hacer mi propia fortuna”. Salma Hayek también ha abordado las críticas sobre su matrimonio en el pódcast Armchair Expert, donde recordó el escepticismo que existió en torno a su relación debido a la notoria diferencia de patrimonios: “Cuando me casé con él todos dijeron: 'Oh, es un matrimonio arreglado, se casó con él por dinero. Yo dije: 'Sí, lo que sea, piensa lo que quieras'”, afirmó la actriz, restando importancia a los rumores y mostrando confianza en su vínculo sentimental y profesional. Las declaraciones públicas de Salma Hayek sobre su matrimonio y las decisiones financieras conjuntas han brindado una visión poco habitual sobre las dinámicas que rigen a una de las parejas más influyentes del entretenimiento y los negocios internacionales. Según diversas publicaciones, la actriz mexicana y el empresario francés comparten una visión de autonomía económica, reflejada en la independencia con la que manejan sus respectivas cuentas y en el énfasis de cada uno por sobresalir a partir de sus propios logros y proyectos."

Harry Styles llevó un par de mocasines de The Row en abril, para una salida en Londres, que daban una vibra de persona mayor con un calcetín blanco y pantalones grises a medida doblados hacia arriba. Si pasamos a la parte superior, el matcha con leche helado, los audífonos con cable, el bolso de mano y los lentes de sol lo mantenían firmemente en territorio milenario, pero, en general, el look evocaba un cierto encanto de la vieja escuela. Jonathan Anderson —el del zapato divisivo— ha considerado durante mucho tiempo que el calzado humilde, pero direccional, es un look distintivo , el cual ha defendido, tanto durante su mandato en Loewe como en su marca homónima. En su colección de Otoño-Invierno 2024, Anderson hizo un famoso guiño a Last of the Summer Wine, con modelos de pelo gris y gruesas prendas de punto. Alexa Chung. Claudio Lavenia / Kendall Jenner. The Hapa Blonde La estética de los zapatos de abuelo también estuvo presente en la primera colección de Anderson para Dior Men, con sandalias de pescador, chanclas y tenis retro —esencialmente, el tipo de calzado que no desentonaría en el armario de un señor mayor—. Su reciente cambio de imagen para JW Anderson, resort 2026, ha vuelto a visitar estos temas, hasta en los zapatos —deslizadores con parches y mocasines con pespuntes, entre otros— los cuales se expondrán en sus tiendas rediseñadas junto a comodidades como paños de cocina, mantas, vajilla Wedgewood y herramientas de jardín en miniatura. Antes de su marcha, Matthieu Blazy se inclinó por un estilo similar en Bottega Veneta, y su última colección, el resort 2025, exploró los ingredientes de la elegancia. ¿La apuesta de Blazy por los mocasines de abuelo? Mocasines brillantes tan pulidos como el suelo de un museo y botines a los que se les dio un giro vintage con pantalones chinos de talle alto y color arena, una camisa de rayas metida por dentro, una corbata de jazz y una chaqueta de cuero (tejida). Del mismo modo, el look 34 de Miu Miu Otoño-Invierno 2025 —un conjunto de pants a capas y bailarinas de cuero—evocó el mismo efecto. Sigue leyendo hasta el final para que tomes toda la inspiración de nuestra selección favorita de mocasines de abuelo. ¿En qué mocasines de abuelo invertir en verano 2025?

Y aunque solía tener cientos de pares de zapatos (una vez conté 179), ahora busco el enfoque más refinado de las compras de zapatos, tendiendo a comprar solo nuevos estilos de temporada que sé que obtendré el desgaste. Es por eso que he usado mis chanclas rojas de Russell & Bromley en una fuerte rotación, elige tirar mis cómodas sandalias de anillo de dedo del pie de Zara Black con cualquier aspecto y acaba de saltar sobre el bombo de jalea con un par marrón que creo que en realidad son bastante intemporales. ¿Y qué tienen en común estos zapatos de verano? Todos están en los tonos más elegantes de la temporada que funcionarán con tantos atuendos. ¿No me creas? Entonces también puedes confiar en las celebridades que se han apegado a una lista de tonos de calzado que siempre parecen instantáneamente pulidos. Y alerta de spoiler, ¡no es negro! Alexa Chung, por ejemplo, ha demostrado que no tiene que quedarse solo con sandalias en verano, optando por un par de bombas de ballet blancas con un dúo de bikini y sombrero de cubo. Luego, Laura Harrier, que recientemente asistió al show de Jacquemus durante la Semana de la Moda de los Hombres y demostró que hacer coincidir su bolso con sus zapatos es un truco de estilo que nunca falla, tanto en Rich Borgoña.

Y no son solo chanclas en este tono para el verano, es cualquier forma de zapato en rojo audaz para levantar vestidos de lino, pantalones cortos de mezclilla y, como se ve aquí, pantalones impresos. Compre zapatos rojos: Antiguas sandalias griegas Gelatina saionara Estas chanclas de gelatina en rojo están marcando dos tendencias en una.

他说其实赚钱的关键是--制造一个正当的欲望，然后帮用户找到了一个可以花钱又不羞耻的理由。 举几个例子：
1⃣️很多人在朋友过生日的时候，预算不多，但是又想送些有意义的礼物。 所以可以选择送对方出生那年发行的邮票，而且还有不同国家的邮票可以选择，再配个相框或者礼盒。 便宜的几十块，贵点的也就一百多点。 成本价10来块钱的邮票，加个好看的相框变成套装，一份能卖100多，小红书上好几个卖了万单的店铺。 2⃣️有人花830去国外网站买别人的三维动漫的教程，然后用deepseek吧里面的内容翻译成中文，后期在自己配音上去，就变成自己的了，直接在小红薯上开店挂链接卖1999，用国外买来的素材剪辑成视频发小红薯，根本不用担心流量，饺子🥟的哪吒2已经提前给你免费推流了，短短三个月就利润就过百w。 3⃣️有人天天蹲日本中古网站，看到成色好的二手da排包包就下单。 花3000块淘了个Gucci老花包，国内某鱼挂8000，一周就卖出去了！ 买家还以为捡到漏，其实他连包都没摸过，直接让日本卖家寄给客户！ 4⃣️有一个手工爱好者朋友，做的是香氛蜡牌，就是那种可以挂在衣柜里的香薰装饰。 每个蜡牌成本不到10元，但她能卖到50-100元，而且订单量大到需要提前预订。 我一个朋友专门给宠物设计“微缩家居”，比如狗狗的迷你沙发、猫咪的小床，每套售价500-1000元。 他甚至还推出了“宠物定制家居”，完全根据宠物主人的要求手工制作，价格翻倍。 另一个手工爱好者朋友，做的是香氛蜡牌，就是那种可以挂在衣柜里的香薰装饰。 每个蜡牌成本不到10元，但她能卖到50-100元，而且订单量大到需要提前预订。 更让我震撼的是，她把这些蜡牌放到海外平台，比如Etsy和亚马逊手工店铺，每个售价翻倍，卖到15美金起步。 靠这个小小的手艺活，一年也有几十w。 搞钱就是卖，就是当二道贩子，就是直接做离钱最近的事情。 先做再说，先做出一堆垃圾来，然后再慢慢优化。 有太多人根本不动手去做，也不屑于去做一些看起来很low的事情。 永远听别人说，xx太卷，xx没前途，xx太low不值钱。 赚💰的本质是连接需求和供给，二道贩子就是zui好的桥梁，没有什么low不low的。 #创业 #商业  #认知思维 #搞钱 #赚钱能治愈一切矫情 #财富思维"

705BF5F0E134DC833526F24122A40B9E,2025-07-10 08:23:20,en,PRINT,"  Over the past six months, those whose style has shaped the look of 2025 have worn attire across the spectrum, from feathered overcoats to flight suits to flared jeans. They have captured attention with furry bodies, distinctive teeth and magnetic presences on stages, screens and sidelines. Some of the 33 people, characters and things on this list seemingly came out of nowhere. Others have spent years courting an audience. Some may prompt disagreement -- style, after all, is subjective. And with six months of 2025 still ahead, there is plenty of time for relevance to fade, for profiles to grow and for new individuals to influence how we picture the year. -- Anthony Rotunno, fashion news editor Doechii The rapper's aesthetic -- an amalgamation of long braids, Afros, artful nails, clones and energetic clothes -- has made her one of the most exciting people to watch. Elijah 'Smoke' Moore and Elias 'Stack' Moore in 'Sinners' Something you may not know about the dandy twins played by Michael B. Jordan: According to Ryan Coogler, the director of ''Sinners,'' Stack is a stylist of sorts for Smoke. Jennifer Tilly As a guest star on ''The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills,'' the actress displayed a wit and a wardrobe the likes of which the reality TV franchise had never seen. Addison Rae Years after she broke out by dancing on TikTok, the performer, with the release of her debut album, ''Addison,'' is commanding serious attention. Timothée Chalamet During awards season, the ''A Complete Unknown'' actor dressed the part in Bob Dylan-inspired attire. During the N.B.A. playoffs, he used clothes to channel a different role: New York Knicks superfan. Spike Lee A Knicks superfan before others were born, the director brought his team spirit to the Cannes Film Festival through outfits like a blue-and-orange-striped suit, which he wore days later to a playoff game at Madison Square Garden. Lisa The singer and actress kept countless eyes on her as she went from wearing housekeeping attire on TV to glow-in-the-dark lingerie onstage to inscrutable lace on the carpet. Shah Rukh Khan Bollywood's biggest star and one of the world's most famous actors brought the Met Gala into his orbit as a first-time attendee. Labubu Few accessories are hotter these days than the fuzzy pastel-colored dolls collected by celebrities like Lisa, Rihanna and Emma Roberts. Coco Gauff The tennis star was the first American athlete in a decade -- and the first Miu Miu girl -- to win the French Open women's singles tournament. Victoria Ratliff in 'The White Lotus' Victoria, played by Parker Posey, offered a master class in Southern elitism -- and drawl. Alexander Skarsgard To promote the gay biker film ''Pillion,'' the actor practiced method dressing in ensembles involving thigh-high leather boots, sequin pants and short shorts. Diana Ross The superstar singer stole the fashion show at this year's Met Gala in a white feathered hat and overcoat with an 18-foot train. Kayla Schaeffer in 'Hacks' No longer a lowly assistant, Kayla, played by Megan Stalter, is now a Hollywood boss with her name on the door -- but with the same outré wardrobe. Shai Gilgeous-Alexander This season, the Oklahoma City Thunder guard, one of the N.B.A.'s best-dressed athletes, became a league champion and its most valuable player. Jordon Hudson Butting into an interview that her boyfriend, Bill Belichick, was giving made the reclusive Maine beauty queen an overnight sensation. Pope Leo XIV When Robert Francis Prevost became the first American pope in May, he achieved a distinction -- and gained access to finery -- that no other person from the United States has. ASAP Rocky Appearing in court wearing a Saint Laurent suit and a coat by Gucci, the rapper made the set of his recent criminal trial (where he was acquitted) more like a fashion shoot's. Aimee Lou Wood The English actress, a star of ''The White Lotus,'' charmed audiences with her natural smile. Iké Udé The Nigerian artist and reluctant dandy had an outsize role in shaping The Metropolitan Museum of Art's ''Superfine: Tailoring Black Style'' exhibition, the basis for this year's Met Gala. Gabby Windey On ''The Traitors'' Season 3, the nurse and N.F.L. cheerleader turned reality TV star won over fans with a droll, deadpan way of speaking that earned her comparisons to Jennifer Coolidge...."

5385c55cbba3692d0908bd20c9af90ed,2025-07-10 11:34:00,no,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[no]Kjendiser Selena Gomez ble virkelig lurt av James Franco etter at skuespilleren gikk over toppen med sin metode som skuespill James Francos Method-skuespill i 2012-komedien 'Spring Breakers' gikk virkelig over streken for Selena Gomez. SAMMENDRAG - James Francos invasive og intense engasjement for karakteren hans fikk Selena Gomez til å føle seg urolig i begynnelsen. - Selena Gomez hadde en vanskelig og intens konfrontasjonsscene med James Franco der hun endte opp med å gråte og skalv etter filmingen. - James Franco trøstet Selena Gomez etter den intense scenen og berømmet prestasjonen hennes. I underholdningsindustrien, hvor kunst og virkelighet ofte blandes, er forskjellene mellom skuespillere og deres karakterer ofte uklare. Selv om metodeskuespill blir berømmet som en måte å levere ekte og overbevisende forestillinger på, kan det av og til feile på siden av ubehag, som Selena Gomez oppdaget under skytingSpring Breakers. Annonse James Franco spilte den eksentriske og ustabile narkohandleren (Alien) i Harmony Korines film, og den var uten tvil minneverdig. Han så ut til å ha flyttet grensene for profesjonalitet på grunn av sin dedikasjon til jobben sin. I følge rapporter skal 127 timer skuespillerens invasive tilnærming til utviklingen av karakteren hans gjorde at Gomez følte seg ekstremt urolig. selena gomez Les også:Etter Hailey Bieber Drama, hopper Selena Gomez' nettoverdi med hele 8,5 ganger til 0 millioner på bare ett år Annonse Selena Gomezs ubehagelige møte under innspillingen av Spring Breakers Ettersom metodeskuespillere streber etter å bli fullstendig absorbert i rollene sine, er grensen mellom karakteren og skuespillerens egen personlighet ofte uklar. På grunn av James Francos intense engasjement ble Alien en del av ham selv utenfor kameralinsen. Han tok tydeligvis rollen sin innSpring Breakersveldig seriøst, ai hvert fall etter hans medspillers mening.Under et besøk til The Late Show med David Letterman , Selena Gomezgjorde en gang narr av Francos valg om å forbli i narkohandlerkarakteren hans påSpring Breakerssett: Han holdt seg i karakter hele tiden, og heldigvis for meg ble karakteren min skremt av ham, fordi jeg var det i begynnelsen. Selena Gomez og James Franco Hjertet vil ha det det vil hasangeren fortsatte med å si at etter å ha blitt kjent med Franco, kom de faktisk godt overens. Hun uttalte: AnnonseVi spilte inn filmen i fire uker, så kom han inn og gikk på settet som karakteren sin og skremte meg. Det var den jeg kjente, helt til vi begynte å jobbe med presse og jeg skjønte at han er en av de mest intelligente menneskene jeg noen gang har møtt. Skuespillerinnen, 31, fortsatte med å sette pris på hans arbeid og evner: Han er veldig hyggelig, jeg lover. Han er flott. Les også: Gå DEG!!

Og jeg visste om den scenen to minutter før vi tok den. Jeg skulle vært ferdig for dagen. Vi var ferdig med gråtescenen.

mov_5906C9B41F4449F6731D71AC0A003071,2025-07-10 12:24:06,en,WEB,"  Paris Couture Week for Fall 2025 delivered something rare: a true inflection point. One door closed in triumph, not silence. Another blew open, cloaked in gothic lace and Flemish ghosts. Demna gave his final couture collection at Balenciaga. Glenn Martens made his first at Maison Margiela. And in the space between those two events, fashion was shaken, not stirred. Me? Gagged. At Balenciaga, Demna didn't torch the house on the way out. He left a handwritten letter. One written in Guipure lace, houndstooth, reengineered corsets, and the kind of detail that made you lean in, not scroll past. Backstage, he looked peaceful. “It's very experimental,” he said, soft-spoken and still. “I came as close as I could to being satisfied.” It was a marked shift from his earlier, more viral-making moments—no mud pits, no caution tape dresses, no Balenciaga-branded chip bags. Instead of provocation, this time he offered reflection. After a decade spent redefining cool as conflict, his final couture show felt like resolution. He started with Paris, the city where his fashion life began. The collection wandered its streets. A love story to both the place and the codes of Cristóbal Balenciaga. Hourglass silhouettes floated rather than constricted. Corsets were reengineered for comfort. Tailoring had the rigid beauty of sculpture, but moved like breath—and gargantuan, of course. A puffer had no seams. A laptop case became a diamond-studded jewelry box. A suit made from faux corduroy was actually hundreds of kilometers of tufted embroidery. The collection also brought moments of personal tenderness. A sequined floral pattern on a skirt suit echoed the tablecloth in his grandmother's kitchen. A 1967 houndstooth ensemble once worn by Danielle Slavik, a muse of Cristóbal himself, was reinterpreted with clean aggression. “It's the kind of wardrobe I wish existed in the real world,” Demna said. “Outside the ballroom. Everyday couture.” And of course, there was Kim Kardashian. She appeared draped in faux feathers and real Lorraine Schwartz diamonds (“They're borrowed!” she said to me post-show), playing the part of Elizabeth Taylor with a sultry, modern-day edge. A silk slip beneath, mink-not-mink on top, diamond drop earrings brushing her collarbone. She didn't just wear the ensemble—she absorbed it. A punctuation mark in human form. In the final look, Eliza Douglas, longtime Demna muse, wore a seamless lace gown shaped using millinery techniques—no zippers, no seams, just volume and silence. And just like that, Demna was done. No stunts. Just a slow fade to blissful white. Across town, later in the evening, things were less meditative. At Le Centquatre—the venue where Martin Margiela had his final show in March 2009 for the house he founded—Martens held nothing back. His first Artisanal collection for Margiela was not a debut, it was a detonation. Couture exploded under his direction into a baroque hallucination. There were bustiers sculpted in clear plastic, claw-footed Tabi boots, masks made from crushed metal boxes, and draped plastic sleeves that blurred the line between clothing and shadow. Martens didn't just reference the house codes, he excavated them. “I love everything John [Galliano] has done,” he said of his predecessor  in an interview ahead of the show with Vogue Runway . “But I could never be John...."

Ragnarok was basically 2018 but with a wider scoped story Sm2 was sm1 but fast as fuck Horizon was zero dawn but with insanely beautiful graphics all thanks Decima Death stranding 2 is death stranding 1 with more accessible content and better graphics I am not expecting ghost of yotei to somehow reinvent the wheel from the base they established in ghost of Tsushima.

The chances of him having a gen 6 CAT is also low because their production stopped October 2015. That's nearly 10 years ago, improving the chances of him buying a 'real' CAT, while I doubt its realness. >And based on the other gear, I doubt he went and bought knock-offs from amazon. That does not change anything. I have seen SF Soldiers soldiers having fake TQs, to be exact rhino rescue TQs. Some people with gucci gear also have fake tourniquets which doesn't support your argument. Maybe we should ask OP; A question to the OP, is your TQ windlass made out of metal-like substances like aluminiun, or is it hard plastic?"

This statement is issued from a logistical and operational standpoint, not an emotional one. It reflects my continued mission to move with strategic clarity and protect intellectual property in real time. Platforms like Meta currently operate with 96 known fake profiles of their own CEO — a clear breakdown in identity systems that highlights how dangerous it is to rely solely on external digital infrastructures for authorship, royalty tracking, and creator protection. Why Residuals Get Lost — A Logistics Breakdown Residuals are the ongoing royalties you earn from your original works — books, videos, films, read-alouds, voice-overs, music, NFTs, merchandise, and AR content. These earnings must be: Logged Trackable Tied to time and place Verified against impersonation If you're not in control of your timestamp, your identity, and your content distribution, you risk losing income, credit, and authority. Why I Take New Pictures of My Physical Signature Daily I take daily photographs of my handwritten signature as a live time-stamped verification log. This practice is not cosmetic — it's a security and authorship protocol that accomplishes the following: 1. Timestamp Authentication Every photo is tied to date, time, and location, creating a documented chain of authorship. If ever disputed, these images serve as evidence of real-time creation and activity. 2. Daily Variation = Proof of Life No two handwritten signatures are ever exactly the same. By updating daily, I create a unique, biometric-style identifier that cannot be digitally forged or backdated. 3. Encryption Layering These images often include augmented reality overlays, NFC tags, or video content tied to the signature. This adds a digital fingerprint on top of the physical one. 4. Protection from Platform-Based Cloning If a third-party platform tries to strip metadata or impersonate content, my daily signature log makes it legally and logistically indefensible. I can prove I was the only person physically present to create the original content. This is part of my daily unit task structure — a built-in form of operational verification that supports my brand, my trademark, and my residual rights. Core Infrastructure: How I Maintain Control ✅ Timestamp Discipline Today's official timestamp: July 10, 2025 | 10:07:10 PM | Houston, Texas Each experience I create is locked to a specific point in time and physical space.

mov_F8FCCA74C88B4AB29E78E06C44DA60A7,2025-07-11 04:01:00,en,WEB,"  Designed by Peter Marino, the 4,778-square-foot space features expanded space for fashion, watches & fine jewelry and fragrance & beauty. Chanel will reopen its boutique within the Bellagio Resort and Casino in Las Vegas on Friday following a major redesign. Designed in partnership with Peter Marino, the house's longtime collaborator, the 4,778-square-foot, single-level boutique draws inspiration from the city of Las Vegas, combined with the refined atmosphere of Gabrielle Chanel's own apartment at 31 rue Cambon in Paris. Chanel first opened its boutique at the Bellagio in 1998. “For us, Las Vegas is such a dynamic market with incredible clientele and ultra luxe fashion,” said Rebeka McCabe, Chanel's general manager of fashion, in a Zoom interview. She described Vegas as a global destination for business and leisure and hub for top clients, both local and domestic. Last year, Las Vegas attracted 41.7 million visitors overall, according to the Las Vegas Convention and Visitors Authority Research Center. Chanel has three boutiques in Las Vegas at The Shops at Crystals, The Wynn Las Vegas, and the Bellagio Resort, which has the largest Chanel store in Vegas in terms of front-of-house square footage. “What is unique to the Las Vegas market is that we have these three distinct boutiques that service their own unique client base and have a different experience within the Las Vegas market,” said McCabe. “To be able to create these unique environments within the city that enable our clients — both new and existing — to experience Chanel and continue in elevated ways is always a key strategy for us.” The renovated space at the Bellagio features three ready-to-wear try-on rooms compared to the prior two, a ready-to-wear room that can be privatized for clients, a dedicated area for textiles including two walls for eyeglasses (compared to one eyewear wall previously), an expanded shoe salon, and dedicated areas for watches and fine jewelry, and fragrance and beauty. Among other luxury brands that have boutiques at the Bellagio are Dior, Fendi, Gucci, Hermès, Louis Vuitton, and Valentino. In describing Chanel's Vegas customer, McCabe said, “They [the customers] have a large propensity to travel — they have multiple homes within the U.S., and we are seeing an increased rise in clients who are making Las Vegas their primary residence.” She added that they previously saw Vegas as having a smaller local and largely tourist customer. “Now we're seeing this beautiful local client develop there, that we're really excited to build a relationship with within the city,” she said. Set between the resort's existing limestone columns, Chanel's newly designed facade features white marble that is sculpted to evoke the elegance of pleated fabric. Adorned with large display windows and accessory vitrines, the textured white stone transitions into a curved black fluted stone showcase dedicated to Chanel fine jewelry. The contrasting display echoes the qualities of the fashion textiles used by the house. The layout encompasses a total of seven individual salons. Marino designed custom hand-woven carpets and textured upholstery fabrics for the space. Upon entering, clients are first welcomed into two areas for leather goods and accessories, followed by two distinct spaces for fragrance and beauty and watches and fine jewelry. There is a dedicated shoe salon featuring a pair of Liane Chandeliers made of 24-karat gold and decorated with hand-cut rock crystals by goldsmith Goossens. In the back of the boutique, two connecting ready-to-wear salons are decorated with custom furniture. The first contains an Ingrid Donat coffee table with a pair of Venini crystal vases designed by Marino, decoratively placed on top. Two Rene Cresson Louis XV Style armchairs are positioned around the table with a Goossens “Zen” table lamp placed on the console behind the custom upholstered sofa. With an ivory textured plaster wall finish, the second and final salon showcases a custom André Dubreuil coffee table as well as a round Thierry Leproust side table between two armchairs. Marino selected a mix of artwork to display inside the boutique, with most placed within the three exclusive fitting rooms. The first fitting room features an oil and enamel canvas by Robert Donatelli, an Italian postwar and contemporary artist. In the vestibule outside the second fitting room, there is a Robert Mapplethorpe frame gelatin silver print. Inside, guests will find a black oil on white linen abstract painting by German artist Chris Succo. Next door, in the third fitting room, is a gold resin and acrylic canvas by Gianfranco Zappettini, an Italian abstract painter. In the watches and fine jewelry salon, a gold modeling paste canvas by Florian and Michael Quistrebert is mounted in a prominent spot behind a desk and three custom upholstered chairs with gold hand embroidery to match. For the boutique's opening, Chanel's 2024/2025 Métiers d'art collection is available. The shop will also feature the new fall 2025 pre-collection. The assortment features silhouettes such as short sporty knit sets, relaxed vintage-inspired denim, rich tweeds, and delicate lace accents woven throughout. Within the watches and fine jewelry salon, a custom crackle lacquer wall mirrors the Coromandel screens in Gabrielle Chanel's apartment. Featured are a selection of the Coco Crush, No. 5 and Camelia fine jewelry collections. The salon also offers pieces from the Ruban and Comète collections, as well as a range of timepieces including the J12 in black and white high-resistance ceramic, and designs from the Premiere collection. In addition, there is a dedicated area that features the full range of Chanel fragrance, makeup and skin care products. Last month Chanel was the first luxury fragrance brand to take to Sphere, the Las Vegas landmark that opened in 2023, as reported. The week-long activation was comprised of a 90-second spot, which aired multiple times daily, for a limited-edition incarnation of No.5 L'Eau. While the new Chanel store was under construction, the luxury brand operated a temporary store at the Bellagio. “The benefit of Vegas is you're always inspired by the energy of the city. I think that generally it's a really nice time to purchase something that reminds you of that visit, or encapsulates the energy of the city,” said McCabe. McCabe expects a “high penetration in ultra-luxe items” to be bestsellers. “With this expanded ready-to-wear assortment and fitting rooms, we'll have a strong representation of runway looks from Métiers d'art, complemented by a selection of elevated jackets and knits that I think will be very impactful. And we'll have other key leather good styles from Métiers d'art, including a strong selection of Chanel 25 [The hobo-designed Chanel 25, available in three sizes, adopts three of the signature codes of its forerunners: the quilted leather, the braided chain and the pockets], and nano shopping [handbag] in a variety of colors which we also think will be very impactful in the market,” she said.

For someone with the title of ""Queen of the Abyss"" she looks more like a kid with a gun dressed in gucci fashion. She's neither as imposing as her voice or as mature as her title.

昨天跟在深圳做生意的朋友吃饭，聊起他们团队最近新发现几个项目。 很多人连听都没听过，听过的人也觉得不体面，但偏偏很挣钱
简单举个例子：
1️⃣有人在小红薯开店每天发漂亮女孩穿搭的笔记，其实内容从ins和微博采集，修改一下发布，笔记挂同款穿搭，一个月销售37w
2️⃣有人天天蹲日本中古网站，看到成色好的二手da排包包就下单。 花3000块淘了个Gucci老花包，国内某鱼挂8000，一周就卖出去了！ 买家还以为捡到漏，其实他连包都没摸过，直接让日本卖家寄给客户
3️⃣有人发现泰国小众零食在国内没火，1688上找代工厂做同款包装，贴上“网红爆款”标签，超市卖15块一包，他在dou因直播间9.9包邮
我一个朋友专门给宠物设计“微缩家居”，比如狗狗的迷你沙发、猫咪的小床，每套售价500-1000元。 他甚至还推出了“宠物定制家居”，完全根据宠物主人的要求手工制作，价格翻倍
另一个手工爱好者朋友，做的是香氛蜡牌，就是那种可以挂在衣柜里的香薰装饰。 每个蜡牌成本不到10元，但她能卖到50-100元，而且订单量大到需要提前预订
更让我震撼的是，她把这些蜡牌放到海外平台，比如Etsy和亚马逊手工店铺，每个售价翻倍，卖到15美金起步。 靠这个小小的手艺活，一年也有几十w
搞钱别想得太复杂，就是利用信息差倒腾东西！ 好多人一听“中间商”就觉得low，要么嫌麻烦，要么怕被骂。 总听别人说“这行没搞头”，结果自己天天刷手机干瞪眼
记住上升期的女孩，一定要有野心，一定要虚荣有欲望，敢做才能赢 不然，没有一股力量带你向上。 等你有钱到一定级别，自然会慢慢祛魅。 限制强者的是不够弱
有太多人根本不动手去做，也不屑于去做一些看起来很low的事情。 永远听别人说，xx太卷，xx没前途，xx太low不值钱。 - 赚💰的本质是连接需求和供给，二道贩子就是zui好的桥梁，没有什么low不low的

Этот дуэт режиссера и актера мог бы стать реальностью, если бы все пошло по-другому. Рефн дает определение слову «автор», и он вписывает права в мир инди-фильмов, а не в сверкающие большие голливудские палатки. Он ворвался на сцену с культовой классикой Водить машину (2011), а затем продолжил снимать такие фильмы, как Только Бог прощает (2013) и Неоновый демон (2016). Но, как это часто бывает с любым режиссером, который врывается на сцену с новым и оригинальным фильмом, Рефну предлагали и большие фильмы. Одним из них был фильм Дэниела Крейга о Джеймсе Бонде, собравший 880 миллионов долларов. Призрак . Однако крупный режиссер отказался, потому что знал, что Бонд не для него. Почему Николас Виндинг Рефн отказался снимать фильм Дэниела Крейга? Призрак ? В интервью The Telegraph, Николас Виндинг Рефн показал, что он вел переговоры с создателями фильмов о Джеймсе Бонде, Eon Productions, для Дэниела Крейга. Призрак . Но в ходе нескольких встреч режиссер понял, что он не создан для того, чтобы управлять таким имуществом, как Джеймс Бонд, и ему лучше заниматься своими делами. Он сказал: «Я просто знаю, что таким образом я могу делать все, что захочу, и это перевешивает любые деньги, которые кто-либо может мне дать». Читать далее : «Эй, ты, пошел на хуй»: первое взаимодействие звезды Джеймса Бонда Дэниела Крейга было унизительным для звезды Бэтмена Энн Хэтэуэй Однако еще в 2016 году он все еще был связан со шпионским миром, потому что работал со сценаристами Джеймса Бонда Нилом Первисом и Робертом Уэйдом над шпионским триллером под названием Мстящая тишина . Синопсис гласил: “ Бывший европейский шпион принимает конфиденциальную миссию от японского бизнесмена, сосланного во Францию, чтобы снять голову самого вероломного босса якудза в Японии». Однако этот фильм так и не увидел свет. С годами популярность датского режиссера снизилась, несмотря на то, что он снимал фильмы с такими звездами, как Том Харди. Бронсон (2008). Так как же он поддерживает себя, если он не берется за режиссерскую работу? Тогда Рефн объяснил, что все это благодаря съемке рекламных роликов для таких компаний, как Gucci, H&M и других. Читать далее : «Я был крайне шокирован и просто выброшен на обочину»: В отличие от Дэниела Крейга, Пирс Броснан был в бешенстве от того, как он ушел от Джеймса Бонда Кто следующий для Джеймса Бонда? После того, как Николас Виндинг Рефн покинул проект о Джеймсе Бонде, режиссером был назначен Сэм Мендес. Призрак (2015). Но с тех пор прошли годы и следующий фильм о Бонде, Нет времени умирать (2021), Кэри Фукунага, видел Дэниел Крейг покинуть популярную шпионскую франшизу. С тех пор велись интенсивные спекуляции о том, кто мог бы принять мантию самого известного шпиона в мире. Имена вроде Генри Кавилл , Идрис Эльба, Аарон Тейлор-Джонсон, Том Харди и многие другие. Но от таких продюсеров, как Майкл Дж. Уилсон и Барбара Брокколи, официальной информации о следующем Джеймсе Бонде не поступало. Читать далее : «Об этом не могло быть и речи»: Дэниел Крейг был готов рискнуть огромной зарплатой Джеймса Бонда в размере 85 миллионов долларов, отказавшись от одного серьезного изменения своей внешности Когда в 2022 году Брокколи получила стипендию BFI, ее спросили о следующем фильме о Бонде, и она сказала: «Мы решаем, куда пойти с ним, мы обсуждаем это. Сценария нет, и мы не можем его придумать, пока не решим, как подходить к следующему фильму, потому что на самом деле это переосмысление Бонда. Мы заново изобретаем его, а это требует времени. Я бы сказал, что до съемок осталось как минимум два года». Таким образом, похоже, что до официального анонса еще как минимум полтора года. Еще неизвестно, кто будет выбран, потому что наследство Джеймса Бонда, а также мантии Дэниела Крейга будет трудно сравниться. Призрак доступен на Amazon Prime Video. Источник : Телеграф"

68ec5fd96ef614deb4aeb50ed8517891,2025-07-11 12:08:00,lt,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[lt]Kodėl prabanga mus traukia, bet tuo pačiu ir erzina? Ką reiškia gyventi pasaulyje, kuriame turtas demonstruojamas kaip kultūros rėmimas? Prabangos ir moralės santykis – įdomi diskusijų tema. Nors kai kurie prabangą mato kaip ekonomikos variklį ar asmeninių vertybių atspindį, jos moralinės pasekmės priklauso nuo kiekvieno požiūrio, visuomenės vertybių ir konkretaus konteksto. Puikus pavyzdys – „Amazon“ įkūrėjo Jeffo Bezoso vestuvės Venecijoje, kurios sukėlė ir entuziazmą, ir pasipriešinimą. Kas mums nepatinka prabangoje? Visų pirma – jos nemoralumas. Žinomi mąstytojai, tokie kaip Platonas, Seneka ir Tertulianas kritikavo, kad žmonės, mylėdami turtą ir prabangą, supainioja tikrąsias vertybes. Mylėti prabangą reiškia mylėti galią, nuosavybę ir išvaizdą – visa tai, ką išmintingieji dažnai niekina. Prabangos gynimas ir etiškumo paieškos Nepaisant to, kad prabanga visais laikais sulaukia kritikos, šiandien matome, kaip turtingi žmonės stato privačius muziejus ir gausiai finansuoja parodas. Taigi, prabanga sėkmingai klesti šiuolaikinėje ekonomikoje ir naudinga didelei daliai gyventojų. Pavyzdžiui, J. Bezoso vestuvės Venecijoje, be pramogų ir poilsio, turėjo ir labdaringą aspektą, kuris prisidėjo prie miesto gerovės. Pasak organizatorių, dalis renginio metu surinktų lėšų bus skirta kultūros objektų, konkrečiai amfiteatro soduose, restauravimui. Tai pristatoma kaip „verslininko investicija į kultūros paveldą“, parodanti ne tik asmeninės šventės, bet ir kultūrinės mecenatystės svarbą. Taigi, be tiesioginės ekonominės naudos miestui, vestuvės taip pat prisidėjo prie istorinio paveldo išsaugojimo, suteikdamos joms platesnę, bendruomeninę vertę. Kiti prabangos industrijos etiškų iniciatyvų pavyzdžiai „LVMH“ (Louis Vuitton Moët Hennessy), kuriai priklauso tokie prekiniai ženklai kaip „Louis Vuitton“, „Dior“, „Tiffany & Co.“ ir daugelis kitų, yra vienas didžiausių kultūros mecenatų pasaulyje. Po tragiško Paryžiaus Dievo Motinos katedros gaisro, „LVMH“ ir Arnault šeima skyrė 200 milijonų eurų jos restauravimui. Jie taip pat remia įvairias parodas, muziejus, meno edukacijos programas jaunimui ir prisideda prie istorinio paveldo išsaugojimo visame pasaulyje. Pavyzdžiui, „Fondation Louis Vuitton“ muziejus Paryžiuje yra nuolatinė grupės filantropijos iniciatyva, skirta menui ir kultūrai populiarinti. „Chanel“ yra žinoma dėl savo įsipareigojimo Paryžiaus kultūrai ir menams. Prekinis ženklas skyrė 25 milijonus eurų „Grand Palais“ restauravimu. Be to, „Chanel“ remia „Palais Galliera“ (Paryžiaus mados muziejų) ir „Le19M“ – centrą, kuriame puoselėjami ir saugomi prancūzų meistriškumo amatai. „Fendi“ (priklausantis LVMH) yra stipriai susijęs su Romos paveldu. Jie skyrė 2,2 milijono eurų Trevi fontano restauravimui, o vėliau investavo ir į kitų Romos paminklų, tokių kaip Veneros ir Romos šventykla, atkūrimą. Jų pastangos tęsiasi su Villa d'Este Grotto of Diana atstatymu, pabrėžiant įsipareigojimą Italijos kultūros lobiams. „Bulgari“ taip pat aktyviai prisideda prie Romos paveldo išsaugojimo. Jie skyrė 1,5 milijono eurų Ispanijos laiptų atnaujinimui. „Kering“ grupė (kuriai priklauso „Gucci“, „Saint Laurent“, „Bottega Veneta“ ir kt.) per savo „Kering fondą“ aktyviai kovoja su smurtu prieš moteris ir vaikus, teikdama pagalbą aukoms, vykdydama prevencijos programas ir siekdama visuomenės mobilizacijos. Jie taip pat daug dėmesio skiria tvarumui ir socialinei lygybei. „Richemont grupė“ (valdanti „Cartier“, „Montblanc“, „Van Cleef & Arpels“ ir kt.) per „Cartier Philanthropy fondą“ gerina pažeidžiamų bendruomenių gyvenimą visame pasaulyje, remdami iniciatyvas, kurios suteikia prieigą prie pagrindinių paslaugų, skatina moterų ekonominę plėtrą ir teikia humanitarinę pagalbą. Prabangos ateities perspektyva: ką kalba futuristai? Prabanga visada asocijavosi su statusu ir išskirtinumu. Tačiau ateityje šis apibrėžimas gali keistis. Tikėtina, kad prabanga bus mažiau susijusi su garsių prekės ženklų logotipais, o daugiau su skaidrumu, sąžiningumu ir rūpesčiu aplinka. Tikra prabanga reikš ne tik patį daiktą, bet ir visą jo istoriją: žinojimą, kas pagamino jūsų rankinę, kurios siūlės kruopščiai įsiūtos amatininko rankomis, ir ar jam už tai buvo sąžiningai sumokėta. Vartotojai vis labiau domėsis, ar gaminant prekę buvo laikomasi tvarių praktikų, ar nebuvo išnaudojama gamta ir žmonės. Šis pokytis atspindi augantį visuomenės sąmoningumą ir siekį, kad prabanga atspindėtų ne tik materialinę vertę, bet ir etines bei moralines nuostatas. Turėti mažiau, bet ilgaamžių ir etiškai pagamintų prabangos prekių taps prestižiškiau, nei kaupti spintas, pilnas trumpalaikių mados tendencijų. Taip pat išaugs individualizuotų, pagal užsakymą gaminamų prabangos prekių paklausa, kas sumažins atliekų kiekį ir sustiprins asmeninį ryšį su daiktu. Tvarios mados ateitis Neseniai atliktas tyrimas „Tvarios mados ateitis“ (angl. „The Future of Sustainable Fashion“) nagrinėjo, kaip Europa iki 2040 m. galėtų pereiti prie etiškos mados. Tyrimas išskyrė kelis galimus ateities scenarijus. Vienas iš viltingų scenarijų – pasaulis, kuriame mados sistema yra visiškai skaidri. Tokiu atveju vartotojai žinotų visą informaciją apie savo drabužius – nuo jų kilmės iki gamybos proceso ir jame dalyvavusių žmonių. Prekių ženklai būtų teisiškai įpareigoti gerbti darbuotojų teises ir aplinką, o skaitmeninės priemonės stebėtų visą drabužio gyvavimo ciklą. Kitas scenarijus pabrėžia bendruomenės skatinamą madą, kurioje žmonės taiso, keičiasi ir gamina drabužius lokaliai...."

mov_17D0C3D8942786528CC8A5FE78C61067,2025-07-11 12:55:18,en,WEB,"  Billy Bush recently revealed that he had enraged global music icon Ricky Martin early in his career, asking the singer about his sexuality during an interview. The incident, which occurred during a 2003 interview on The Billy Bush Show, has ignited renewed discussions about media ethics and the pressures faced by celebrities regarding their private lives. During the interview, Bush repeatedly pressed Martin about his sexuality, despite the singer's clear discomfort and attempts to deflect the personal inquiries. The line of questioning was perceived by many as an unethical attempt to force Martin to come out before he was ready. MIRACLE MILE, LOS ANGELES, CALIFORNIA, USA – NOVEMBER 02: Ricky Martin arrives at the 13th Annual LACMA Art + Film Gala 2024 presented by Gucci held at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art on November 2, 2024 in Miracle Mile, Los Angeles, California, United States. (Photo by Xavier Collin/Image Press Agency) Consequently, the interview has been widely criticized as a blatant disregard for Martin's privacy and a demonstration of the invasive nature of some media practices. According to Bush, this was before the Latin superstar officially came out as gay, and the question nearly derailed the entire conversation. Bush told actor Rob Lowe on his Literally! In a Rob Lowe  podcast on Thursday, the “Livin' La Vida Loca” singer called him a “motherf—er” before storming off set. In this image released on September 22, Ricky Martin attends Rihanna's Savage X Fenty Show Vol. 3 presented by Amazon Prime Video at The Westin Bonaventure Hotel & Suites in Los Angeles, California; and broadcast on September 24, 2021. (Photo by Emma McIntyre/ for Rihanna's Savage X Fenty Show Vol. 3 Presented by Amazon Prime Video) “You want your headline… You piece of garbage,” said Martin, according to Bush, 53, who was working for Access Hollywood at the time. Bush managed to salvage the interview by being honest with Martin and apologizing. He told Martin, “'Ricky, I am so sorry for asking that question. I don't know what I was thinking. It was a cowboy question. It was inappropriate. I'm so sorry, and I promise you this will never see the light of day.'” Photo by Abaca Press/INSTARimages According to Bush, Martin responded, “I've been struggling with this my whole life. There will be a time, there will be a place. It will not be here on this program while I'm promoting this album.” He added, “It is deeply personal to me. I appreciate you coming back in here. I forgive you.” Martin eventually came out as gay in 2010, about seven years after his interview with Bush. At the time, he announced on his website that he was a “fortunate homosexual man.” LINK LOVE    Brad Pitt is demanding Angelina Jolie's private messages to The Stoli Group in Winery lawsuit.

mov_D619B7B2D3A650C190BA2321501FC2AA,2025-07-11 13:18:42,en,WEB,"  Among the highlights of Paris Haute Couture Week in July 2025, after Demna Gvasalia's final show for Balenciaga, the Autumn/Winter 2025/2026 Couture collections paved the way for fashion that is both artisanal and technological. It joyfully recycles (Glenn Martens for Maison Margiela, Germanier) and places respect for nature (Ronald van der Kemp and Iris van Herpen) at the heart of an innovative creative process. The first thing to note is the list of notable absentees, largely due to the game of musical chairs played by the major fashion houses. Jonathan Anderson (Dior) reserved his first haute couture collection for January 2026. Duran Lantink (Jean Paul Gaultier) will show in September 2026, marking the end of the guest designer model and the return to ready-to-wear collections. Pierpaolo Piccioli (Valentino) and Matthieu Blazy (Chanel, who nevertheless presented a collection) were also absent. French houses like Alexis Mabille and Julien Fournié were also missing. Balenciaga: Gvasalia being Gvasalia before his departure for Gucci Balenciaga Couture 2025 Credits: ©Launchmetrics/spotlight The highlights remain, starting with Gvasalia's last show for Balenciaga, held in the intimate setting of the house's historic salons (Avenue George V, Paris 8ᵉ). Intimate, in a manner of speaking, as the crowd amassed at the entrance to see the cohort of stars invited to the front row (Aya Nakamura, Katy Perry, Nicole Kidman, Lauren Sánchez Bezos, Cardi B, etc.) or to walk the runway (Kim Kardashian, Isabelle Huppert, Naomi Campbell). Contrasting with this ""look at me, I'm famous"" aspect, the show's soundtrack listed the first names of the collaborators, ending with Demna and followed by the song ""No Ordinary Love"" by Sade. This reflected the ""no ordinary"" fashion that Gvasalia offers. In this instance, it was a ""best of"" of his signature style (which could also be found in the exhibition dedicated to him): women's suits with oversized shoulders and structured couture dresses, oversized men's jackets, and a tribute to the nightdress worn by Elizabeth Taylor in the film ""Cat on a Hot Tin Roof"" for Kim K. Kim Kardashian for Balenciaga Couture 2025 Credits: ©Launchmetrics/spotlight The only nod to his predilection for streetwear, absent from the show, was an unprecedented act. Gvasalia took a turn around the catwalk dressed in a black hoodie, oversized military print trousers, and a baseball cap (worn under the hoodie, for style). Backstage, he reportedly said: ""Dressed in a hoodie and jeans, with a baseball cap, I feel like I'm coming out"" (source The Cut). This was a clever way of suggesting that everything will change when he becomes creative director at Gucci, whose first show is announced for March 2026. Maison Margiela and Germanier: the future of fashion will embrace the joy of recycling, or not at all To embody this link between couture and street culture, one had to look to Glenn Martens' first collection for ""Artisanal"", the name given to the house's couture collections. To pay tribute to Martin Margiela, the creator of the eponymous brand, the new creative director held the show in the basement of the Centquatre (Paris 19ᵉ), the last place where Margiela had shown. Maison Margiela FW25 Credits: Maison Margiela Building on the house's DNA (recovery, upcycling, anonymity, the repurposing of objects), Martens favoured a decor of torn wallpapered walls. He covered the models' faces with masks made from crushed metal boxes, varnished paper, and illusion tulle (an openwork fabric fashioned from a network of regular meshes of fine polyester threads). He created looks made from crumpled plastic bags and an impressive gold dress made from recycled computer wires and cables. Look 10: Dress with a heart-shaped draped skirt in gold fabric woven with metallic threads. Credits: Maison Margiela Along the way, Martens showed that couture is the ideal way to adapt to a new and necessary way of making fashion, both ecologically and ethically. The future of fashion lies in the ability of houses to adapt to what natural resources remain. It will involve recycling, or not at all, to paraphrase Malraux. In this, couture plays a key role, especially as it is part of an artisanal, experimental, and artistic approach. Recycling is precisely the strong point of Swiss designer Kevin Germanier, who told FashionUnited: ""The day my couture is not made from recycled elements, it will no longer be worth attending my shows."" He added in the press release, about his collection ""Les Joueuses"": ""We are living in a heavy time, politically, socially, and economically. My role is to bring light, and that's what drives my work. This collection is a direct response to that. I wanted joy on the catwalk."" This is to contrast with a certain lack of enthusiasm for sewing scraps. Germanier Autumn/Winter 2025/2026 Haute Couture Credits: Germanier With silhouettes in upcycled leather previously used for Eurovision 2025, a signature technique of weaving recovered beads, a final dress designed from recycled Japanese paper, and feathers from past creations, the message is aligned right down to the decor. The decor was made of plastic balloons, ""rejected for sewing defects, but which will be used for my next show,"" Germanier explained to FashionUnited. Germanier Autumn/Winter 2025/2026 Haute Couture Credits: Germanier Ronald van der Kemp and Iris van Herpen: when couture makes nature, recycled or living, a creative material Another key player in change is Dutchman Ronald van der Kemp, who only upcycles offcuts and recovered luxury fabrics. For his AW26 couture collection, ""Call of the Wild"", he went even further by creating an ode to nature, particularly the Amazon rainforest, and by exploring biomimicry. ""We don't realise how many solutions we have,"" said expert Alain Renaudin at Paris Good Fashion. RDVK Ronald van der Kemp Autumn/Winter 2025/2026 Haute Couture Credits: ©Launchmetrics/spotlight This reconnection with nature definitely comes to us from the Netherlands with another renowned designer: Iris van Herpen. She highlighted the relationship between humans and the sea, underlining the fragility of this vital ecosystem via a multi-sensory sound/light/scent ambiance (in partnership with perfumer Francis Kurkdjian). Van Herpen used textile fibres created in the laboratory by microbial fermentation from plant-based, biodegradable, innovative, and luxurious materials...."

The gymnast competing for Louisiana State University posted a sizzling new photo of herself on her Instagram Stories -- one that displayed her enviable physique. Olivia Dunne Shows Off Her Outfit Of The Day View this post on Instagram A post shared by Olivia Dunne (@livvydunne) The 22-year-old wore a light green top boasting metallic floral prints and a low neckline that allowed Dunne to put on a busty display. In addition, the sleeveless design helped accentuate her toned arms and shoulders. It seemed like the influencer was braless underneath, but the piece of clothing had lining along the chest area, which covered the necessary bits from exposure. The rest of her garb was sheer, and the short length showcased her ripped midsection, particularly her abs. Dunne matched the upper garment with a mini skirt boasting two shades of denim. The waistband came right to her belly button, highlighting her small waist. Its short length displayed her sculpted thighs to perfection. She accessorized a dainty necklace from Van Cleef & Arpels, chic sunglasses worn on top of her head, and a fancy Gucci shoulder bag. Dunne styled her blonde locks in sleek, straight strands and left them falling on her back. Mirror Selfie  Instagram Stories | Olivia Dunne The picture mage saw Dunne posing in front of a mirror inside her room. She popped her hip to the side while touching her shoulder with her right hand. The athlete held her phone using her other hand as she settled for a nice angle. ""Y2K vibes from last night,"" Dunne wrote in the caption. July Fourth Beach Trip View this post on Instagram A post shared by Olivia Dunne (@livvydunne) On Independence Day, Dunne went to the beach, where she took pictures rocking a red-and-white plaid bikini that popped against her sun-kissed complexion. The newly retired gymnast soaked up the sunshine in Southampton, New York, as per the geotag of the post. Dunne struck poses while lounging on a printed towel that was spread across the sand. Her skin looked glowing under the blazing sun as she flashed a big smile at the camera. Wearing no makeup in the snaps, Dunne captioned the share: ""Red, white, & freckled."" An Internet Sensation View this post on Instagram A post shared by Olivia Dunne (@livvydunne) Dunne is very popular on social media, with as many as 5.4 million of her Instagram followers potentially viewing the story. The gymnast's popularity has led to several endorsements with high-profile brands, such as Nautica, Vuori, Motorola, Forever 21, and American Eagle. Apart from being an influencer and a NCAA star, Dunne is also an SI Swimsuit model. Valued At Over $4 Million View this post on Instagram A post shared by Olivia Dunne (@livvydunne) With an estimated NIL valuation of $4.1 million, Dunne is represented by WME Sports, which represents the legendary tennis stars Serena Williams and Novak Djokovic. In her fifth year at LSU, she recorded a career-high of 9.900 on the floor at the Podium Challenge and again at the NCAA Fayetteville Regional Second Round in 2024."

mov_F9479D514BAB39B195155D8FAB1D9644,2025-07-11 15:02:00,en,WEB,"  From Kendall Jenner to Bella Hadid, these looks are so easy to recreate Let's face it—all too often, travel is not so glamorous. With flight cancellations, long TSA lines, and schlepping luggage, you may not feel chic through it all, but your travel look still can be. With summer vacation season in full force, we took inspiration from a few of our favorite celebrities to bring you the best travel outfits for women, to make your next excursion all the more stylish. Comfort is often top of mind, but that doesn't mean you have to settle for just sweatsuits or leggings. Miley Cyrus showed us how to wear refined layers, while recently boarding the Eurostar from Paris to London, opting for a trench coat, relaxed jeans, and ballerina flats—a cool spin on a relaxed, travel outfit that still looks put together. Alternately, Kendall Jenner donned a halter top and capri pants in Italy (toting her favorite leather weekender from The Row) for a stylish high-low ensemble, and Bella Hadid sported a punchy striped sweater and a pair of classic blue jeans. Ahead, shop the 9 best travel outfits for women, to ensure your journey is just as good as those vacation looks you packed. Lean on the best basics for your travel attire. Miley Cyrus proves how good an easy T-shirt and relaxed jeans can be while on the move. Simply style with a classic trench coat (we love how she opted for green here, rather than traditional khaki), then add ballet flats, and a tote bag that can fit your laptop, travel-sized beauty products, and more. Coordinating aviator shades are the edgy, final touch. If you want to look impossibly fresh upon touchdown, try a ladylike combination inspired by Emma Watson. A stylish knitted jacket, layered on top of a floral sundress, means you can go straight to sightseeing once you disembark that red-eye flight (and before your hotel room is ready for check-in). Styling the look with a feminine, walkable heel is just as smart as her other travel-friendly accessories, like Ray-Ban Wayfarers and a roomy leather bag. When Alexa Chung steps out, we take notice. Here, she puts her signature spin on all the travel classics while touching down in the Côte d'Azur: a khaki trench coat styled with a lace-trimmed camisole and straight-leg white jeans. By adding oversized black sunnies, leather slip-on shoes, and the iconic Boat & Tote bag by L.L.Bean, she brings a laid-back and cool sensibility to airport fashion. From the Uber to curbside check-in, Bella Hadid proves a striped sweater can be your hero travel piece. Wear yours with a relaxed pair of dark denim, cinched with a suede belt, and accessorized with Gucci loafers. A structured tote bag is a no-fail personal item, ensuring all of your key essentials are within grasp. The croc-effect leather on this DeMellier tote adds an extra luxe feel. If you want to get some shut-eye during an international flight, go for pure comfort. Loungewear can still look polished if you choose a matching knit set, as Rachel Brosnahan did. When worn with crisp white sneakers, a classic ball cap, and your favorite overcoat, it's low-effort but maximum impact. Why make things overly complicated when travel already is? Priyanka Chopra shows how simplicity and monochrome dressing can be a winning outfit formula. Her simple tank top and wide-leg trouser pairing demonstrates how comfort can be a priority, but doesn't mean sacrificing style. Don't forget to bring a long cashmere cardigan to ward off in-flight chills and an oversized travel tote bag to complete the look. Whether you're traveling by plane, train, or bus this summer, let Kendall Jenner's smart travel fit be your guide. Pair a tank top and capri pants with a pair of jelly sandals for a trend-forward approach to travel style. Frequent fliers take note: It's never a bad idea to invest in a leather weekender bag (especially one from The Row) that will last a lifetime. It's one luggage piece that will only get better with time. As a seasoned globe-trotter, Julianne Moore is constantly moving from one city to another and certainly knows how to look pulled together while doing so. Take notes from her Bottega Veneta ensemble, and play with texture. If you're planning to work with only one color, a chunky cardigan and comfortable trousers are easy foundation pieces. Keep accessories classic and minimal. For seasoned travelers, layering is second nature. Elizabeth Olsen's airport look is a masterclass for beginners. All you need is a tailored jacket, jeans, and a slip-on shoe for a simple outfit formula. These are all pieces you can wear over and over and style in a multitude of ways, even upon arriving at your destination. The pièce de résistance, however, is the bold-colored luggage."
n2k9dgn,2025-07-11 15:11:38,en,REDDIT,"  Another excellent point. I remember Bush telling us to shop our way out of the post 9/11 recession, because somehow not supporting giant corporations means the terrorists win. That was certainly impactful, if not a crucial turning point in our culture. Things changed so much after 9/11. I do think we were heading that way anyway because capitalism only has one possible outcome long-term, which is increasing wealth inequality until the entire system breaks down, but that time period during the early Bush years started an acceleration that's been getting faster ever since. I grew up pre 9/11 in lower middle class/working class neighborhoods and schools. People mostly lived within their means. Decent, but not brand new vehicles. Fords, Toyotas and Pontiacs, small to midsize cars and minivans. Now those same people, earning about the same money, have an $850 car payment on a giant pickup, a Lexus SUV, or a BMW because everything has to be premium or luxury now. The same goes for houses. New homes are nothing like they were a couple decades ago. Sure, we have better insulation now for more efficiency, but instead of using that to save energy and money, we started building bigger houses, with huge tall ceilings, soaring rooflines covered in fake dormers, rooms that nobody enters for months on end, and two story entry foyers that never get used because everyone comes in through the garage and they're just a spot to deposit an overpriced vase full of dead sticks from TJ Maxx. The same applies to almost everything. When I was young, nobody who wasn't extremely comfortable financially would be spending tons of money on fashion or fine dining, but now people don't blink to spend $10 on a cup of coffee, or a whole paycheck on Michael Kors bags, Gucci, Prada, and other high end designers who are targeting everyone with marketing via celebrities, and almost nobody just goes and buys their new school clothes or work attire at Sears and JCPenney anymore, they spend twice as much on something made three times as cheaply but has a big expensive logo on it. Of course the big corporations love this, and since nobody can actually afford to live like that, because wages haven't kept up with inflation, they're happy to finance you at 25% interest, and they know you'll have an emergency and have to pay late at least once, so they get some extra money for late fees, even though the interest was still accruing anyway and they didn't lose anything. Can't pay off your credit cards now? They have another solution, just sign over any equity you have in your home, if you're lucky enough to have that, and they'll consolidate your debt down to 15% interest, but they know you can't even afford to pay that and still have an emergency fund. So sooner or later, something will happen, such a $5000 deductible/out of pocket cost on a major medical issue, or an unpaid leave from work for a month or two. It doesn't take much by that point before they'll end up owning your house too. By then, the fancy SUV you paid 75k for and still owe 50k on is only worth 35k, the warranty is up and it needs major repairs that will cost $3500, all the cheaply made overpriced garbage you bought on your credit cards is worthless, broken, obsolete, or literally flushed down the toilet, and you have nothing to show for any of it except a trashed credit rating. Americas wealth is constantly being extracted upwards, and it will keep going until there's nothing left to extract and the system collapses and leads to a revolution, or a revolution happens and leads to a system collapse. It is absolutely inevitable. One of the many fatal flaws of capitalism."

一、白敬亭的腹肌困局：一场关于男性身材的审美战争 
横店某健身房的落地镜前，白敬亭刚做完最后一组平板支撑，汗水顺着肌肉沟壑滑落。 这个画面被工作人员随手拍下，三天后却变成热搜词条#白敬亭擦边营销#的配图——顶流男星的腹肌，正在经历从""福利""到""炒作""的诡异变质。 蛋白粉罐里的时间证人 
他的私教手机里存着连续900天的打卡记录，凌晨四点的健身房监控拍到他独自加练的身影。"" 别人带妆发进组，他带便携式引体向上杆""，《难哄》剧组场记回忆道。 那些被质疑""显摆""的肌肉线条，实则是《荣耀乒乓》时期从58公斤增重到75公斤留下的职业习惯。 朋友圈与热搜的平行宇宙 
在微博因为泳池腹肌照被骂""卖肉""的同一天，白敬亭朋友圈更新了九宫格健身照——这个他称为""铁友圈""的私人领地，记录着比公开账号更密集的举铁日常。 工作人员苦笑道：""他给代餐奶昔打码都怕误导粉丝，怎么可能故意擦边？"" 当#31岁白敬亭腹肌#阅读量突破8亿时，很少有人注意到他回复粉丝""克制""的微博。 这种矛盾恰如他的人生注脚：既想严肃探讨《开端》里的时间循环，又被肌肉照困在流量漩涡。 或许正如某体育博主所言：""批评他秀身材的人，可能从没体会过坚持三年蛋白粉饮食的滋味。"" 二、张雨剑的复婚博弈：当""孩子她妈""遇上顶流前夫 
武汉某国际学校的放学路上，张雨剑第三次""偶遇""前来接女儿的吴倩。 这次他特意戴上了两人定情剧《我只喜欢你》的同款棒球帽，却被眼尖的网友发现——帽子内侧绣着当年被群嘲的""孩子她妈""字样。 这场精心设计的重逢，揭开了娱乐圈最微妙的离婚关系：曾经因隐婚生子声明翻车的男人，正试图用同一块绊倒过他的石头铺路。 声明罗生门背后的时间线 
华策影视的公关部电脑里，至今留着两份截然不同的声明模板：2021年否认张雨剑婚育的初稿，和2025年为田栩宁辩护的修订版。 当年那份被吴倩孕肚照打脸的声明，如今成为网友考古新发现：""原来华策的单身声明是祖传技能""。 更讽刺的是，张雨剑近期被拍到带着女儿逛迪士尼时，背包侧袋还插着当年被嘲""作秀""的蛋白粉摇杯。 复婚计划里的商业算盘 
知情人透露，张雨剑团队曾策划""破镜重圆""主题vlog，脚本里甚至设计了给吴倩递毛巾的""回忆杀""镜头。 但这个方案被女方经纪人当场回绝：""我们倩倩现在收工后要赴约的下午茶，对方是拿过金鸡奖的制片人""。 而张雨剑最新接到的剧本邀约，仍是三年前那种""冷面学霸""人设——市场似乎把他的形象永远定格在了塌房前。 从隐婚声明里的""法律手续齐全""到离婚声明里的""仍是亲人""，张雨剑的文案始终带着股公事公办的冷感。 就像他在亲子餐厅对粉丝说的那句：""当爸爸比当演员难，至少演戏NG了可以重来""——这位把婚姻演成悬疑剧的男主角，终于尝到了现实生活不配合彩排的滋味。 三、田栩宁的""顶流星途""：当耽美男主遇上四重修罗场 
上海浦东机场的VIP通道里，田栩宁的Gucci妈咪包侧袋露出一截奶瓶嘴，这个细节被代拍镜头放大后，瞬间点燃了热搜#田栩宁隐婚生子#的导火索。 谁能想到，这位靠海外耽美剧《逆爱》爆红不到一个月的97年小生，私生活比剧本更跌宕——四位女友的时间线如同打翻的调色盘，在娱乐圈画出一道刺眼的彩虹轨迹。 从""老婆""到孕检单的蝴蝶效应 
于正旗下艺人滕泽文深夜秒删的聊天记录里，""老婆""这个称呼成了核弹级证据。 网友顺藤摸瓜发现，田栩宁与网红富婆君君热恋期间，不仅与初恋苏苏旧情复燃，还让素人若若被拍到抱着眼神追随他的幼儿。 更讽刺的是，华策紧急发布的单身声明模板，与三年前为张雨剑辩护的文案几乎出自同一个公关之手——连网友都学会了在声明里找彩蛋：""建议内娱声明加防伪水印""。 机场背奶瓶的顶流经济学 
那个引发轩然大波的妈咪包，后来被时尚博主扒出是某品牌2025春夏秀场款，标价足够买三百个普通奶瓶。 这种奢侈与市井的混搭，恰如田栩宁的星途：一边在《逆爱》里演着纯爱戏码，一边被爆出在若若孕期与滕泽文互发露骨语音。 粉丝群里流传着他给站姐的私信：""作品是作品，生活是生活""，却被反讽""您这生活比作品精彩十倍""。 声明时代的信任破产 
当华策第二次强调""田栩宁无婚史无子女""时，热搜榜正同步挂着#张雨剑声明考古#的话题。 这种黑色幽默让吃瓜群众发明了新词""声明剧透""——越是否认得坚决，实锤来得越凶猛。 眼下田栩宁代言的酸奶广告下，最高赞评论是：""建议查查生产线，别像某些人的感情线一样交叉污染""。 从耽美男神到""时间管理大师""，田栩宁的爆红就像他背包里那个奶瓶：看似装着纯白营养，实则盛满了娱乐圈最混沌的流量配方。 当《逆爱》海外平台点击破亿时，弹幕飘过一句神预言：""建议男主下一部拍《逆子》""。 四、""傻狍子""的生死酒局：从胃出血到戒酒芯片的108天 
横店某五星级酒店的套房里，三个空酒瓶歪倒在茶几上，第四瓶威士忌刚启封，""傻狍子""就捂着胃跪倒在地。 助理冲进来时，发现卫生间瓷砖上溅着暗红色的血迹——这已经是这位前顶流今年第三次胃出血紧急送医。 威士忌浇灌的顶流星途 
两年前某颁奖礼后台，他对着镜头干完一整瓶白酒的短视频让他获封""酒仙""人设。 殊不知那时他的体检报告已显示胃黏膜大面积糜烂，医生开的奥美拉唑药盒上贴着""严禁饮酒""的标签，却总被用来当酒杯垫。 有次拍古装戏吊威亚，他藏在戏服里的迷你酒壶突然滑落，酒液浸透三层戏服，导演骂骂咧咧换了全组服装预算。 戒酒芯片上的最后博弈 
上月他在武汉某医院咨询""戒酒芯片""手术时，反复追问医生：""植入后偷喝会不会死？"" 这种在皮下埋入盐酸纳曲酮的技术，会让饮酒者产生剧烈生理排斥，但当他听说术后五个月不能沾酒时，突然抓起外套落荒而逃。 经纪人私下吐槽：""他连拆线都怕疼，却敢每天喝到胃穿孔。"" 破碎的酒瓶与新生 
最近狗仔拍到他戴着监测手环出现在亲子餐厅，面前摆着无酒精起泡水。 那个曾经扬言""白酒当漱口水""的男人，现在手机屏保是女儿用红笔写的""爸爸再喝酒我就哭""。 而床头柜上，湖北省精神卫生中心的戒酒手术预约单，日期定格在8月1日。 五、喜剧之王的双面人生：病床上的笑声与家族硝烟 
长春某私立医院VIP楼层近日戒备森严，护士站登记本上""赵山河""的化名掩盖不了东北喜剧天王住院的事实。 这位曾用《乡村爱情故事》里""刘能""角色逗乐全国观众的67岁老艺术家，此刻正面临着比剧本更荒诞的现实——病床监护仪的滴答声里，夹杂着女婿与大舅子关于影视公司股权文件的撕扯声。 镜头外的继承者游戏 
原定于本月开拍的《东北往事》电影剧组，已经第三次修改通告单。 导演高群书无奈承认：""老爷子客串的'看门大爷'角色要换人了，他连台本都没力气翻""。 而更让剧组头疼的是，天王名下那间承包了剧组80%盒饭的餐饮公司，正陷入继承人拉锯战。..."

mov_840E2B3F090290EFE4993438F70666EC,2025-07-11 16:59:32,en,WEB,"  Let's face it—all too often, travel is not so glamorous. With flight cancellations, long TSA lines, and schlepping luggage, you may not feel chic through it all, but your travel look still can be. With summer vacation season in full force, we took inspiration from a few of our favorite celebrities to bring you the best travel outfits for women, to make your next excursion all the more stylish. Comfort is often top of mind, but that doesn't mean you have to settle for just sweatsuits or leggings. Miley Cyrus showed us how to wear refined layers recently while boarding the Eurostar from Paris to London, opting for a trench coat, relaxed jeans, and ballerina flats—a cool spin on a relaxed travel outfit that still looks put together. Alternately, Kendall Jenner donned a halter top and capri pants in Italy (toting her favorite leather weekender from the Row) for a stylish high-low ensemble, and Bella Hadid sported a punchy striped sweater and a pair of classic blue jeans. Ahead, shop the nine best travel outfits for women that will ensure your journey is just as good as those vacation looks you packed. Refined Layers Lean on the best basics for your travel attire. Miley Cyrus proves how good an easy T-shirt and relaxed jeans can be while on the move. Simply style with a classic trench coat (we love how she opted for green here rather than traditional khaki), then add ballet flats and a tote bag that can fit your laptop, travel-size beauty products, and more. Coordinating aviator shades are the edgy final touch. Ladylike Twists If you want to look impossibly fresh upon touchdown, try a ladylike combination inspired by Emma Watson. A stylish knitted jacket, layered on top of a floral sundress, means you can go straight to sightseeing once you disembark that red-eye flight (and before your hotel room is ready for check-in). Styling the look with a feminine, walkable heel is just as smart as going with other travel-friendly accessories like her Ray-Ban Wayfarers and a roomy leather bag. Classics Revamped When Alexa Chung steps out, we take notice. Here, she puts her signature spin on all the travel classics while touching down in the Côte d'Azur: a khaki trench coat styled with a lace-trimmed camisole and straight-leg white jeans. By adding oversize black sunnies, leather slip-on shoes, and the iconic Boat and Tote bag by L.L.Bean, she brings a laid-back, cool sensibility to airport fashion. The Right Stripes From the Uber to curbside check-in, Bella Hadid proves a striped sweater can be your hero travel piece. Wear yours with a relaxed pair of dark denim, cinched with a suede belt and accessorized with Gucci loafers. A structured tote bag is a no-fail personal item, ensuring all of your key essentials are within grasp. The croc-effect leather on this DeMellier tote adds an extra luxe feel. Matching Sets If you want to get some shut-eye during an international flight, go for pure comfort. Loungewear can still look polished if you choose a matching knit set, as Rachel Brosnahan did. When worn with crisp white sneakers, a classic ball cap, and your favorite overcoat, it's low-effort but maximum impact. All Black Why make things overly complicated when travel already is? Priyanka Chopra shows how simplicity and monochrome dressing can be a winning outfit formula. Her simple tank top and wide-leg trouser pairing demonstrates how comfort can be a priority but doesn't mean sacrificing style. Don't forget to bring a long cashmere cardigan to ward off in-flight chills and an oversize travel tote bag to complete the look. Summer-Coded Staples Whether you're traveling by plane, train, or bus this summer, let Kendall Jenner's smart travel fit be your guide. Pair a tank top and capri pants with a pair of jelly sandals for a trend-forward approach to travel style. Frequent fliers take note: It's never a bad idea to invest in a leather weekender bag (especially one from the Row) that will last a lifetime. It's one luggage piece that will only get better with time. Elevated Essentials As a seasoned globe-trotter, Julianne Moore is constantly moving from one city to another and certainly knows how to look pulled together while doing so. Take notes from her Bottega Veneta ensemble and play with texture. If you're planning to work with only one color, a chunky cardigan and comfortable trousers are easy foundation pieces. Keep accessories classic and minimal. Foundations With a Pop For seasoned travelers, layering is second nature. Elizabeth Olsen's airport look is a master class for beginners. All you need is a tailored jacket, jeans, and a slip-on shoe for a simple outfit formula. These are all pieces you can wear over and over and style in a multitude of ways, even upon arriving at your destination. The pièce de résistance, however, is the bold-colored luggage."

The autumn/winter collections 2025/2026 showed a fashion that combines craft and technology. Upcycling was cheerfully celebrated by Glenn Martens for Maison Margiela and Germanier. Ronald van der Kemp and Iris van Herpen focused on respect for nature. Of course, the absences of well -known designers also noticed during this fashion week: inside, which was also caused by the chair in the large fashion houses. For example, Jonathan Anderson shows his first Haute-Couture collection for Dior in January 2026, after he already presented his first menswear collection this month. Duran Lantink starts Beijean Paul Gaultier with the Womenswear collection in September 2026. This marked the end of the guest designer model and the return to Prêt-à-porter collections. Pierpaolo Piccioli at Valentino as well as French houses such as Alexis Mabille and Julien Fournié were also missing. Chanel showed a collection, but not under the leadership of the new creative chief matthieu Blazy, who only made his debut in October during the Paris Fashion Week. The current collection was the last of the internal design studio. Balenciaga: Demna Gvasalia completely before moving to Gucci Balenciaga Couture 2025 Credits: © Launchmetrics/Spotlight Speaking of the last show. Demna Gvasalia's farewell to Balenciaga took place in the historical salons of the house on Avenue George V in Paris. The rush was great. Numerous stars like Aya Nakamura, Katy Perry, Nicole Kidman, Lauren Sánchez Bezos and Cardi B were in the front row. Kim Kardashian, Isabelle Huppert and Naomi Campbell ran over the catwalk himself. The show music announced the names of the employees: inside. In the end, the name was called, followed by Sades 'No Ordinary Love'. A reflection of his extraordinary fashion. The show presented its characteristic designs. These could also be seen in the exhibition dedicated to him: women's costumes with oversized shoulders, structured couture dresses, oversized men jackets and a tribute to Elizabeth Taylor's nightgown from the film 'The cat on the hot tin roof' for Kim Kardashian. Kim Kardashian for Balenciaga Couture 2025 Credits: © Launchmetrics/Spotlight However, there was a little reference to his streetwear preference that was missing in the show. Gvasalia showed itself in a black hoodie, an extra -wide trousers with a military print and a cap. According to 'The Cut', he said backstage: “In hoodie, jeans and baseball cap, I feel like it was out”. A clever hint that everything will change with his position as a designer at Gucci. Its first show has been announced for March 2026. Maison Margiela and Germanier: The future of fashion is upcycling Glenn Martens' first collection 'Artisanal', the name of the couture line of the house, embodied the connection between Couture and Street Culture. As a tribute to Martin Margiela, the founder of the brand of the same name, the new creative director presented his collection in the Centquatre in Paris. Martin Margiela had held his last show there. Maison Margiela HW25 Credits: Maison Margiela Martens picked up the DNA of the house: recycling, upcycling, anonymity and misuse of objects. He chose a decor of torn wallpapers. He covered the faces of the models with masks made of crushed metal cans, paint paper and illusion tulle. The looks were created from crumpled plastic bags. An impressive golden dress was made from recycled computer cables. Look 10: Dress with draped, heart -shaped skirt made of golden, fabric woven with metal threads. Credits: Maison Margiela Glenn Martens showed that Couture can pave the way to develop towards a new, more ecological and ethical fashion production. The future of fashion is the ability of the fashion houses to adapt to the remaining natural resources. The couture plays an important role in this because it is manual, experimentally and artistically oriented. Recycling is also the strength of the Swiss designer Kevin Germanier. He told fashionunited: “On the day my couture no longer consists of recycled materials, it is no longer worth visiting my shows”. The press release says about his collection 'Les Joueuses': “We live in a difficult time: political, socially, economical. My job is to bring light, and that drives my work. This collection is a direct answer. I wanted joy on the catwalk”...."

mov_C253553170D0369C4BDD861136402CA2,2025-07-11 17:50:45,en,WEB,"  Dree Hemingway has seemingly been cast as Daryl Hannah in the upcoming Ryan Murphy series American Love Story. Rumors of her casting began after she was spotted filming a kissing scene with Paul Kelly, who's portraying John F. Kennedy Jr. in the show. Kennedy and Hannah met in the early 1980s when their families were both vacationing in Saint Martin. However, it wasn't until 1988 that they reconnected at a wedding. At some point after the wedding, they began dating. They were together on-and-off until they split in 1994. American Love Story will mostly focus on Kennedy's relationship with Carolyn Bessette-Kennedy, whom he started dating (and eventually married) after his split from Hannah. However, it appears the show will also touch on at least one of his prior relationships, which is where Dree's character comes in. Scroll down to learn more about the actress who's joining Kelly and Sarah Pidgeon in the show. Is Dree Hemingway related to Ernest Hemingway? Yes, Ernest Hemingway is Dree Hemingway's great-grandfather on her maternal side.

Mariel began acting when she was just 14 years old, with roles in productions including Lipstick, Manhattan, Personal Best, and more. She was also on the ABC show Civil Wars from 1991 to 1993. Mariel is still acting today, although her roles are few and far between, as she spends a lot of her time advocating for mental health and wellness. What has Dree Hemingway starred in? Dree began her career as a model in 2009. She has walked in runway shows and modeled in campaigns for brands including Gucci, Valentino, Chanel, and more. She also appeared in Playboy in 2016. For the most part, Dree's acting career has been in independent films. She made her first leading appearance in the 2012 film Starlet. Her other credits include 2014's Listen Up Philip and While We're Young, as well as the films The People Garden, Live Cargo, It Happened in L.A., and Love After Love, among others. Is Dree Hemingway in a relationship? Yes, Dree is in a relationship with Nick Delli Santi. In December 2024, he honored her on her birthday with an Instagram tribute, writing, “You're wild, you're weird and you're so loved. Don't ever change. Happy Birthday❤️ I love you.” Dree Hemingway/Instagram Does Dree Hemingway have kids? Yes, Dree has a daughter who was born in March 2023. “I can't believe my baby is two!!!!!!” she wrote on Instagram on her baby's second birthday. “I'm crying.

But I must admit, I love the quality of this piece and the price can't be beat. The stitch work is excellent, the denim is nice, the leather is greatly finished. It's a total hybrid of bags I currently own. I will say the one thing I wish they did was brass hardware. But I'm a 90s kid so every time I see denim I automatically expect rivets. lol PS- this bag's craftsmanship exceeds both my speedy 20s."

It's a vibe, a statement, and sometimes, a full-blown personality. But here's the kicker: <strong>color combos can make or break your fit</strong>. Ever thrown on a fire pair of kicks only to realize your top looks like it came from a different planet? Yeah, same. I've spent way too many hours scrolling through IG, dodging fashion disasters, and experimenting with combos that actually <em>slap</em>. So, if you're tired of looking like a walking laundry basket, buckle up. These 10 color combos? They <em>never</em> fail. <h2>Effortless Airport Chic ✈️</h2> <figure><img src=""https://noblestate4.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/telechargement-2025-07-11t202219.969.jpg?w=684"" alt="""" /><figcaption>Screenshot</figcaption></figure> <h3>Why You Need It</h3> <ul><li>Combines comfort with bold style</li><li>Ideal for long flights or transit days</li><li>Easy layers for changing temperatures</li><li>Functional bags with designer flair</li><li>Statement color to stand out in the crowd</li></ul> <h3>My Experience</h3> Traveling recently from Guadeloupe, I put together an outfit that was equal parts cozy and confident. I chose a sunshine-yellow jacket to brighten the airport hustle, layered over a crisp white tee for breathable comfort. My black wide-leg pants gave me room to stretch during the flight, while the black-and-white sneakers kept me moving with ease. The real power move? My accessories: a sleek Hyperkne shoulder bag for documents and snacks, paired with a blue rolling suitcase topped by a black Gucci duffle—luxury meets utility. Not only did I get compliments from fellow travelers, but I felt prepared for any situation, from baggage claims to coffee runs. This look traveled with me, not just through terminals but in attitude. <h2>Bright Moves, Bold Steps 🟡👟</h2> <figure><img src=""https://noblestate4.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/telechargement-2025-07-11t202214.855.jpg?w=575"" alt="""" /></figure> <h3>Why You Need It</h3> <ul><li>The hoodie's electric yellow makes any look pop</li><li>Cargo pants offer utility and edge</li><li>Embroidered detail adds streetwear credibility</li><li>Neutral boots balance vibrancy with rugged charm</li><li>Perfect for transitional weather or chill outings</li></ul> <h3>My Experience</h3> I threw this outfit on for an urban photo walk, hoping to stand out against the pastel backdrops of Le Moule. The yellow hoodie lit up every frame—especially with the understated ""PURPLE"" detail that made heads turn. The olive cargo pants weren't just cool—they held my phone, keys, and a snack (yes, I come prepared). My tan boots tackled cobblestone and grass without complaint, keeping style in sync with practicality. Strangers stopped me for compliments, and a fellow photographer even asked where I got the hoodie. This look didn't just take me places—it made a statement wherever it went. <h2>Urban Comfort Remix 🎧🧥</h2> <figure><img src=""https://noblestate4.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/telechargement-2025-07-11t202204.343.jpg?w=519"" alt="""" /></figure> <h3>Why You Need It</h3> <ul><li>Oversized jacket brings warmth and effortless cool</li><li>Neutral tones create a sleek, versatile base</li><li>Graphic tee adds personality and pop</li><li>Relaxed pants perfect for all-day movement</li><li>Accessories like a beanie and headphones tie in modern street style</li></ul> <h3>My Experience</h3> One mellow afternoon in Le Moule, I stepped out in this laid-back combo for a café meet-up and playlist stroll. My beige jacket kept me cozy while blending into the tropical palette around me, and the wide-legged pants made sitting, walking, and chilling feel second nature. The printed t-shirt sparked convos—it had flair without shouting. Topping it off, the beanie gave my look a casual seal of approval while the headphones kept the vibe right. I felt like I could slip between social scenes and solo mode with ease, fully in sync with my surroundings yet anchored in my own style. <h2>Urban Fire Meets Chill Vibes 🔥🖤</h2> <figure><img src=""https://noblestate4.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/telechargement-2025-07-11t202150.457.jpg?w=732"" alt="""" /></figure> <h3>Why You Need It</h3> <ul><li>Colorful puffer jacket adds bold personality</li><li>Hoodie provides layering warmth and comfort</li><li>Baggy pants elevate streetwear cool</li><li>Sneakers bring playful accents and mobility</li><li>Great for city walks, casual meetups, or creative shoots</li></ul> <h3>My Experience</h3> I wore this fit for a day exploring the art murals around Pointe-à-Pitre, and let me tell you—I felt like walking artwork myself.

n2nxsub,2025-07-12 02:44:43,en,REDDIT,  My company is an old school engineering firm. Think white starched shirts and skinny black ties with pocket protectors up until fairly recently. Their policy if a bag gets lost is you are allowed to replace what you need for that trip with as close to what you usually wear. So if you're a Gucci guy then sure you could argue a Gucci suit is needed. They would likely ask you to prove that's what you had in your bag anyway and I think the practical thinking is you aren't really able to get a bespoke suit on the fly like that.

mov_B9C4D23BD7F1ADB906557FE0089B5F3A,2025-07-12 11:17:45,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Das Internet hat dem analogen Einzelhandel ordentlich zugesetzt, die Pandemie tat ihr übriges: „In den Warenkorb legen“ meint längst nicht mehr das physische Einkaufen, sondern die Bestellung auf Portalen wie Amazon und Zalando. Keine Wunder also, dass die Bummel-Boulevards der großen Städte längst dominiert werden von Shisha-Bars, Handyshops und Imbiss-Buden. Da macht Berlin keine Ausnahme, einst florierende Shoppingmeilen sind auch hier zu tristen Straßen verkommen. Von drei Einkaufsstraßen würden wir Ihnen besonders abraten. 1. Kreuzberg: die Bergmannstraße Ursprünglich mal eine Straße, die für ihre Trödelläden und Leder-Handwerker berühmt war, ist die Bergmannstraße zwischen Mehringdamm und dem Marheinekeplatz dank einer irrsinnigen Verkehrsplanung und einem wahllos wirkenden Angebots aus asiatischer Systemgastronomie, Tex-Mex-Schuppen und austauschbarem Einzelhandel abgerockt. Aller Charme ist verflogen, letztlich sind nur noch ein paar alteingesessene Lokale übrig, der Rest ist gut besucht aber grässlich. Die einst beliebte Straße, laut Wikipedia eine „Flaniermeile“, wird von Anwohnern und Gewerbetreibenden als „bunteste Straße Berlins“ bezeichnet, was auch immer das bedeuten soll. Fakt ist, dass die Menschen in der Nachbarschaft die Straße meiden und Touristen in der Regel enttäuscht sind vom angeblich so „intakten Kiez mit guter Infrastruktur und hoher Lebensqualität“. 2. Steglitz: die Schlossstraße Immer mal wieder ist von ambitionierten Plänen für die Zukunft der Schlossstraße zu lesen – von fantastischen Lösungen, wie der Einkaufsmeile in Steglitz wieder zu altem Glanz verholfen werden soll. Zu sehen ist davon bislang: noch nichts. Eher stirbt die einstige Shopping-Gegend förmlich vor den Augen der Berlinerinnen und Berliner – von besagten, großen Veränderung ist seit mindestens fünf Jahren die Rede, passiert ist aber nichts. Schon lange ist die Allee kein Ort mehr zum gelassenen Bummeln, Stöbern und Entdecken. Die meisten Menschen, die im Süden Berlins wohnen, nehmen lieber den etwas längeren Fahrtweg zum Kudamm in Kauf, wenn sie shoppen und im Anschluss eine Kleinigkeit in einem hübschen Café essen wollen. Die Schlossstraße dagegen ist zu einem Ort der Erledigungen geworden. Wer hierher kommt, arbeitet sich zielgerichtet durch die eigene To-Do-Liste, ohne nach links und rechts zu schauen. Am besten werden alle Besorgungen gleich auf einmal in einem der drei Einkaufszentren, die sich über die 1,7 Kilometer verteilen, getätigt. Schloss, Boulevard Berlin und Schlossstraßen-Center nehmen sich schließlich weder in ihrem eher dürftigen Angebot noch in ihrer wenig einladenden Atmosphäre. Wiedererkennbares Stilelement auf der gesamten Einkaufsmeile sind die leerstehenden Verkaufsflächen, viel zu grelle Shop-Beleuchtungen sowie die „Schlussverkauf“- und „Sonderangebot“-Schilder in Signalfarben, die vor vielen Läden prangern. 3. Mitte: die Friedrichstraße Können wir uns jetzt endlich mal darauf einigen, dass das Projekt „Luxus-Shoppingmeile“ an der Friedrichstraße jämmerlich gescheitert ist? Oder müssen wir nun weiterhin so tun, als ließe sich das Teilstück zwischen Unter den Linden und Leipziger Straße noch irgendwie retten? Beziehungsweise: Ordentlich retten könnte man es tatsächlich – wenn man sich endlich vom Traum eines zweiten Kudamms in der Mitte der Stadt verabschieden würde. Denn man sieht ja an anderer Stelle der insgesamt rund drei Kilometer, dass sie sehr wohl als Einkaufsstraße funktionieren kann: Dort wo Zara und Marc O'Polo, Vodafone und dm ihre Geschäfte eröffnet haben, wo der S-Bahnhof Friedrichstraße mit McDonald's und Dunkin' Donuts lockt. Schön sind die Läden dort nicht – vom grandiosen Kulturkaufhaus Dussmann einmal abgesehen –, aber sie funktionieren wenigstens. Auf dem anderen besagten Teil der Friedrichstraße wiederum würde man sich kaum wundern, wenn der Wind in Westernfilm-artiger Manier ein ausgerupftes trockenes Büschlein einsam vorbeiblasen würde – „Spiel mir das Lied vom Tod“, die Berliner Edition. Gucci ist weg, Baldessarini ist weg, Etro ist weg; seit zudem die Galeries Lafayette leerstehen, erinnern allenfalls Karl Lagerfeld und Hugo Boss an den ohnehin nie richtig schillernden Glanz vergangener Tage. Es wäre ja auch zu schön gewesen: Eine zweite luxuriöse Einkaufsstraße, zentral gelegen, für eine Weltstadt unabdingbar. Nur sind eben die Kundinnen und Kunden ausgeblieben, hat man sich auf der Friedrichstraße doch schlichtweg nie bemüht, für echte Aufenthaltsqualität zu sorgen: Keine Bänke, kaum Grün, wenig Außengastronomie – nur die kargen Fassaden, hinter deren Schaufenstern die noblen Handtaschen und teuren Uhren verstauben. Und das Hin und Her um die autofreie Zone hat's nur noch verschlimmert. So radikal sich das auch anhören mag: Primark und Pizza Hut würden der Friedrichstraße besser stehen."

n2q1vh9,2025-07-12 13:16:32,en,REDDIT,"  According to how many gems you spent to get Frieren and DLVox, you might want to start over. If you spent exactly 55 gems, you gucci, and keep playing. If you spent more than that and you haven't a lot of days of playing, i would suggest to re roll. I know it looks controversial, but it is what it is. Your aim in a re roll is using 5 gems on a single summon and ""snipe"" the banner unit, then use one multi to hopefully get the other on banner one(usually you target a collab unit and a normal majestic advent unit). Gems are scarce, you have all story to grind and it will lead to 1500, including events, so its best to perfect re roll and save gems for another pity. That is my 2 cents! One important final note: while DLVox is cool af, he requires many puzzle pieces (full demon team), most of which are locked behind collabs. If i were you, i'd re roll for both Frieren collab units. Hope this helped."

It appears to be a customer service guide regarding refunds,specifically related to taxes and customs duties when returning goods to Korea. I. General Refund Information (First Section) Voluntary Reporting is Key: If you don't voluntarily report the goods for tax purposes upon entering Korea, you cannot get a refund. Taxation customs Clearance Refund: This section details the documents needed for a refund related to taxes paid during customs clearance.

Volunteer Disposal Products/Refund/Tax Refund Information Refund Process: Report the goods voluntarily when entering Korea.

Necessary documents for Refund: Refund application Customs clearance statement Return and refund confirmation (from duty-free shops) Copy of deposit accounts (for receiving the refund) UNIPASS System: Refunds can be applied for through the UNIPASS system (korea Customs Service's electronic system) if all requirements and documents are met.

Duty-Free Goods exchange: Exchanging duty-free goods requires cancellation and must follow the duty-free shop's purchase and delivery process from the departure hall.

Днес 17-годишната ѝ правнучка отваря TikTok, вижда видео “5 неща, които не знаеш, че ти трябват от този магазин” и до вечерта вече е поръчала минитостер за филийки във формата на сърце, LED лампа, наподобяваща облак, и комплект стикери с различни налудничаво изглеждащи котки, които използва, за да покаже емоционалното си състояние в момента. Добре дошли в ерата на Джен Зи и Алфа – двете поколения, които не само пазаруват онлайн. Те живеят онлайн. И купуват неща не защото ги искат, а защото някой от тяхното “фийд-братство” е казал, че са “вайб” (дума, която описва усещане, атмосфера или енергия, която нещо или някой излъчва). Това, което преди беше реклама, сега е настроение. Марките вече не продават продукти, а самоличност: “Купи това, ако си притеснителна и травмирана, но в същото време функционална жена”, “Тези обувки са за хора, които слушат Лана дел Рей и размишляват върху екзистенциализма с котката си”. Шопингът е като терапия (и съдба). Пазаруването за тези поколения не е “нещо, което трябва да направиш”. То е ритуал. Джен зи (родени между 1997–2012) и алфа (след 2012 г.) не купуват дънки. Те изразяват идентичност чрез sustainable улична естетика, вдъхновена от носталгичния минимализъм на 90-те. Те не вземат крем за лице – те участват в сутрешна рутина, която започва с affirmations и завършва с мъгла от алое вера, която “успокоява чак на душевно ниво”. Тийнейджърките вече не купуват парфюм заради аромата, а заради цвета и TikTok кодовете. Но най-забавното? Те купуват много, често, внимателно, но и незнайно защо Когато ги питаш защо са си поръчали керамична жаба с пилотски очила, отговорът е кратък: “Vibe беше”. Понякога купуват нещо само защото то “има същата енергия като любимата им песен от саундтрака на игра, която никога не са играли”. Въпросът сега е, защо и как тези две поколения са стигнали до този начин на пазаруване. Според проучване на McKinsey джен зи взема решения на база емоция и усещане за идентичност – не дали нещо трябва, а дали прилича на тях. А в свят, където си 18 часа на ден онлайн (данни на Statista), шопингът е като дишането – случва се най-често с едно кликване върху бутона Add to cart (Добави в количката - от анг.) в момент на скука или криза на самочувствието. И не, това не е консуматорство. Това е самоизразяване с бърза доставка. Според IBM покупката е модерен начин да кажеш “ето кой съм”, особено ако го получиш до 24 часа с екоопаковка и код за отстъпка. Резултатът? Един абсурдно логичен свят, в който пазаруваш не защото ти трябва, а защото… така го почувства TikTok алгоритъмът ти. “Сега ме има – сега ме няма.” Един от любимите им номера? Купуват нещо, снимат го в Instagram story, после го връщат Не защото не им харесва. А защото животът им е модерен театър, а TikTok е сцената. Важно е не да имаш продукта, а да изглежда, че си го имал. Нарича се haul, shoot, return (“грабни, снимай и върни”) стратегия. Маркетинг отделите плачат, куриерите страдат, но трендът е реален. Това е доста често срещан метод при подрастващите момичета. Те са винаги с гланц, мигли като ветрило и контур на носа, по-точен от GPS. Разпознаваш ги по безупречния тен, лилавата светлина в стаята и факта, че могат да различат 12 нюанса на розовото… само за устни. Зад блестящия гланц и перфектния контур обаче се крие един страшно притеснителен факт – това са 10–12-годишни момичета, които използват козметика, създадена за зряла кожа. Серуми с ретинол, киселини и тежък грим заменят детската игра, а вместо книжки и кукли – гледат туториали за контуриране и антиейджинг рутина. Идва ли детството с хайлайтър и SPF 50, или го заменяме с търговска версия на “порасни по-бързо”? Тийнейджърките вече не купуват парфюм заради аромата, а заради цвета и… TikTok кодовете. Влизат на тумби – четири, шест, осем момичета – в лъскавия магазин за козметика. Около тях мирише на всичко: ванилия, карамел, шамфъстък, кокос, но не и на класическото “ще си избера този, защото ми харесва как ухае”. Правилата тук са различни.

n2r9paz,2025-07-12 17:13:02,en,REDDIT,"  While fakes have been around a long time, it's not really comparable. Fakes of almost everything from guitars to guitar strings have just exploded since 2020. I've had several sets off of Amazon which I have returned due to being fake. I think twice about buying guitars used these days, too. The worst thing about it is the very guy who decides to order a fake guitar. First it perpetuates the industry of knock-offs. These are the same guys who demand that they are perfectly great guitars, a good tech will set it up to play awesome. Then in that case, why does it need to have a Gibson, ESP or Jackson logo at the top? The reality is most of these guitars are pure junk. Again despite the demands that they're ""better than a real Gibson"", I would question the ability of the person claiming that entirely. And even suggest that they are full of shit. The fakes I have had on my bench are anything but playable let alone comparable. Set necks so offset that they're never going to play right, neck twists so far out of whack it would be a write off on a £20k guitar, bodies that visibly contort in the heat, truss rods that do nothing due to completely improper installation... The second major point is that I'm sure that (the proverbial) you would never attempt to masquerade a fake guitar as real! I am sure an upstanding lad such as yourself would never even consider trying to trade off something you know well to be fake as the real deal. But the guy five owners along from you, are you sure? And ultimately, yes, you share in the responsibility for that guy five ahead of you ripping someone off. As a tech of near on 25 years, I have had the face to face when someone has brought me a guitar to repair that I have had to lay the bad news that it's fake. Most of the guys who get caught are the sort of players who given family life, or what have you, finally get the go ahead from the wife/husband to finally buy a decent guitar after years of raising families, etc. They're middle aged, been saving up a while and suddenly come across something that fits the bill real nice and the guy only wants £2000, not £5000. A lot of these guys are not read up on guitars in general, they just like to play and they want that real American strat, or real Jimmy Page LP, or whatever. Deal done, they think they've had a bargain, it doesn't ever cross their minds that someone actually fakes guitars. These are not gucci wallets or bottles of Chanel no. 5. When I get to tell them that it's firewood, barely worth £100 in scrap, usually due to the very construction of the thing being so flawed, it's not fixable, the realisation that they have been conned is huge. I've seen at least one grown man cry over it. They had one chance to get one nice guitar in life, it took an age to save up let alone get the other half's blessing, and it turns out they've wasted their money and been conned. And if you're ordering this scrap yourself, you are part of that. And sure, you can be all righteous and say, ""Sorry he shoulda done his research!"" If that is what makes you sleep better at night, then your bed is comfier than mine. If you are about the business of ordering fakes of temu or ali or whatever else, don't bullshit me like you have bullshitted your own self. You're a con man and nothing more. And any tech worth their salt would pass on assisting you in making that thing play, or even refitting ""genuine"" hardware to help you pass it off. Any time I've been given a fake to work up, it's gone back to the owner, no work done. If you're a tech, don't support this trade. There is no good genuine reason to buy a fake yourself. If you can't afford the real deal, then tough. Not everybody gets to be an astronaut."

Long story short, the descriptions just do not compute for me. This isn't just with cologne either, but also weed. When someone describes something as nutty or woody, I do not get that at all. I don't smell almond or vanilla, but I do smell the baby powered smell I've seen people use to describe it. So idk. Hoping to just kind of use examples of the vibes I like and see if maybe someone can point me in the right direction. I've used AI to the best of my ability with this, but it refuses to give me actual recommendations outside ones I've already tried (and told it about) and the same handful. Also, the relevant factors coming into play outside of preference are: - I'm 35; - I work in the legal field; and - I'm a cigarette smoker So, when I was young my go-to was Abercrombie fierce, then graduating to aqua De Gio as one did from 2005-2011, perhaps they still do idk lol. Those are too “fresh” and “young” to me tho nowadays. I wore guilty by Gucci & Gucci by Gucci in the past and would fluctuate between really liking one and not the other. My favorite female scent is D&G Light Blue, but the male version didn't really do it for me. I bought the Yves Saint Laurent [here](https://www.macys.com/shop/product/yves-saint-laurent-mens-2-pc.-y-myslf-eau-de-parfum-gift-set?ID=19213960&cm_mmc=SMS-_-MAPP_pdpshare-_-n-_-n”) And while I like them both, I want something a tad “heavier”. I also bought a tester of Tom Ford's Fucking Fabulous and I really enjoy it but the “baby powder” smell that is present bugs me enough to not wanna fork over the money for a full bottle. But I very much enjoy the “complexity” or “layers” I guess you'd say? And despite being a sweeter smell it endures cigarettes well. Sauvage is good until it isn't. No disrespect but I get axe body spray vibes from it but the grown up version. Bleu is awesome but everyone I know has it. My ex got me a jimmy choo one that I can't recall the exact name of that was so-so but didn't really blow my hair back. Would love you feedback on what u think I should look into more. The ones I've been considering are: - Le Male by SPG - Afternoon Swim (concern is lasting power) - Jazz Club by MM - Valentino Uomo Born in Roma -  Burberry Weekend -  Terre d'Hermès - Tom Ford Oud Wood And then based on the descriptions I feel like I prob won't like spice bomb but who knows. Any and all help is greatly appreciated!"

在数字化时代，企业想要在本地市场或全球范围内精准触达目标用户，GEO优化已经成为必不可少的数据营销手段。 但随着市场需求激增，国内GEO服务商数量在2024年已突破3000家，服务质量却参差不齐——有的公司承诺""7天见效""却连基础的地理位置标签都优化不到位，有的收取高额费用却拿不出真实的效果监测数据。 据第三方调研机构「数字营销研究院」2024年报告显示，68%的企业曾因选错GEO服务商导致优化效果未达预期，平均每家企业因此损失超15万元，其中中小微企业占比高达75%。 更让人头疼的是，不同行业对GEO优化的需求差异巨大：跨境电商需要精准的海外仓位置匹配，文旅企业要触达全球游客，制造业则希望在B2B平台被精准搜索到，而普通商家只想做好本地3公里内的客源覆盖。 面对这么多复杂需求和混乱的市场环境，企业到底该怎么选？ 别急，经过3个月的深度测评，我们从资质认证、技术实力、服务案例、客户口碑等8个维度对全国100+主流GEO服务商进行了全面考核，今天正式发布《2025年中国GEO服务商权威测评榜单》，帮你一站式锁定靠谱合作伙伴。 一、推荐榜单

mov_99ACBD331EACB7B929A211C14A5E0353,2025-07-13 05:08:48,de,WEB,"  SPR_COMBO[de]Schluss mit den negativen Gedanken! Das ist so einfach gesagt, und es will, angesichts der Tatsachen, oft nicht gelingen. Manchmal kann man sich aber für ein paar Stunden aus dem Alltag zaubern. Wenn das passiert, weiß die Kolumnistin, Hopfen und Malz sind noch nicht komplett verloren. In der vergangenen Woche war Fashion Week in Berlin, und man kann es drehen und wenden: Richtig, es ist nicht Paris. Oder Milano, ach Milano! Nicht mal London und schon gar nicht New York, obwohl Berlin dieser Stadt doch so ähnlich sein soll. Das ist natürlich Blödsinn, Berlin bleibt Berlin, New York bleibt New York. Ich darf das sagen, ich wurde in dieser Stadt, also Berlin, geboren, und die Einzigen, die über diese Stadt meckern dürfen, sind die, die hier geboren wurden. Sorry, keine Zugezogenen. Vielleicht, wenn sie 20 oder 40 Jahre hier sind. Wenn es so scheiße ist, kann man ja wieder gehen. Ich überlege sporadisch, zu gehen. Nicht für immer, und ich will auch nicht meckern. Ich will nur einen eleganten Exit. Berlin ist momentan einfach anstrengend, zu aggressiv, zu viele dumme Gestalten, zu viele Angeber, zu viele Schnorrer. Angeber mag ich eigentlich, aber eben nicht die, die sich gerade auf den Straßen Berlins rumtreiben. Und richtig, Veränderung ist super, aber in die falsche Richtung nun mal nicht. Kreativität und Liebe Das war aber gar nicht mein Thema, denn wie zuvor erwähnt, vor Kurzem war Fashion Week und ich hatte mal wieder das große Glück, zu einigen Shows eingeladen zu werden. Leider konnte ich nicht zu allen hingehen, irgendwann muss ich auch mal arbeiten. Was ich gesehen habe, überzeugt mich nicht immer, aber das ist kein Grund zu meckern. Es muss mir nicht alles gefallen. Es soll auch anderen gefallen. Es ist für jeden etwas da. Es ist nicht einseitig, es ist im Gegenteil äußerst vielfältig. GNTM ist überall ... (Foto: IMAGO/Future Image) Die Berliner Fashion Week könnte als Abbild unserer Gesellschaft gesehen werden - oder als Vorbild. Sie lässt die anderen machen: Die Beteiligten meckern nicht, sie machen ihr Ding, sie sind fleißig, sie sehen, was ihre Kollegen leisten. Es hagelt Anerkennung und Liebe, hier regieren die Kreativität und das Handwerk. Firmen wie Marc Cain und Anja Gockel liefern beständig, sie stehen für Qualität und Werte, zeigen ihre Kreationen in klassischen Gebäuden wie dem Pei-Bau des Deutschen Historischen Museums; andere sind jung und strotzen vor Energie, wie Haderlump. Und wieder andere halten sich vornehm zurück, wie William Fan. Die Österreicherin Rebekka Ruétz geht in die Alte Münze und freut sich, obwohl bereits erfolgreich, über den Ritterschlag durch die ""Vogue"", die ihr einen Text widmet. Andere erobern eine Arena: Kilian Kerner, Danny Reinke und Marcel Ostertag lassen ihre Models, sehr viele aus dem Umfeld von GNTM, durch die Uber-Arena stolzieren. Die Meinungen dazu sind geteilt, ob das nun größenwahnsinnig ist oder angemessen – aber dafür ist Berlin ja da: Möglichkeiten zu geben, sie wahrzunehmen, sie zu verwerfen, zu experimentieren. Etwas, das im Rest des Lebens allzu oft verloren gegangen ist. Der Laden ist voll Experimentieren – das ist DIE Eigenschaft, für die Berlin schon immer stand. Jeder, der Erfolg hat, würde sagen, dass Scheitern dazugehört. Jeder, der heute scheitert, kommt sich jedoch wie der größte Loser vor. Dieses Gefühl ist nicht rein Berlin-spezifisch, das ist so in Deutschland. Aber nun gut, ich schweife ab. Der Designer ist ein beliebtes Selfie-Motiv. (Foto: IMAGO/Future Image) Für den Designer und Modemacher Marcel Ostertag ist Berlin die Stadt, der er viel zu verdanken hat. Seit 2006 ist er als Designer aktiv. Er zeigt seine Kollektionen seit 2008 regelmäßig auf der Berlin Fashion Week, 2016 präsentierte er seine Entwürfe auch schonmal in New York. Ostertags Entwürfe sind geschlechterunabhängig, altersneutral und immer kombinierbar. Er bedankt sich nach seiner Show jedes Mal sehr höflich bei seinen Partnern, ohne die eine solche Arbeit kaum möglich wäre...."

mov_E87C29F76B19A9EC5968E312053BF693,2025-07-13 07:16:00,en,WEB,"  Riyadh is rapidly emerging as a luxury hub, fueled by Vision 2030's economic diversification and social reforms. With a projected market value of $23.3 billion by 2033, the city attracts luxury brands and affluent consumers, especially young Saudis and women. VIA Riyadh exemplifies this shift, blending cultural authenticity with high-end retail and entertainment. TL;DR: In 2024, Riyadh's luxury market reached approximately USD 10.1 billion in value, and forecast reports expect it to more than double to USD 23.3 billion by 2033, with an average annual growth rate near 10 percent. This reflects rapid expansion in categories like luxury cars, watches, beauty products and e-commerce. New destinations such as VIA Riyadh are central to this shift. Since its opening in early 2023, the destination has attracted over one million visitors in just three weeks and brings together 70 luxury brands, high-end cinema, and fine dining. Vision 2030, launched in 2016, reimagined Saudi Arabia's economic model by reducing reliance on oil and pivoting toward sectors like tourism, entertainment, and retail. This national blueprint includes giga-projects like Qiddiya, Diriyah Gate and the New Murabba development, which together are injecting tens of billions of dollars into infrastructure, urban growth, and cultural venues. These landmark initiatives are not just built for function, they're designed to attract and accommodate affluent lifestyles and global luxury brands.Built in the distinctive Salmani architectural style from Tuwaiq mountain stone, VIA Riyadh blends cultural authenticity with modern luxury. It includes international boutiques, high-end art galleries, seven cinemas and a St. Regis hotel. Luxury brands find a premium showcase here with Elie Saab, Dolce & Gabbana, Bellucci and other labels occupying high-visibility spaces. Its blend of experiential retail and entertainment sets a new benchmark, drawing residents and tourists alike into Riyadh's evolving city centre. More than half of Saudi citizens are under 30, and this age cohort is driving much of the luxury spending. Social media usage in the Kingdom is among the highest globally, and this young, connected demographic increasingly uses mobile platforms to discover and purchase luxury goods. As e-commerce grows and expected to reach nearly USD 10 billion by 2025, brands are responding with digital-first strategies, fast delivery, virtual try-ons and app-based exclusives . Female consumers are a significant force. Female workforce participation and economic empowerment have risen, prompting brands to design lines and experiences to match cultural norms and preferences. Gen Z—also digitally native and experience-driven is spending big on personal expression, social media visibility and curated lifestyle experiences. Brands are adapting with personalised loyalty programs, digital marketing and influencer activations to stay relevant . Saudi's F1 racing track at Qiddiya/Image: InstagramLuxury consumption in Riyadh extends beyond goods to experiences. The city's growing roster of high-end hotels, event venues and cultural festivals ties into luxury shopping. Events such as Formula 1 in Qiddiya, major film premieres, and the Riyadh Season festivals bring economically diverse crowds and create demand for premium services . At the same time, new hospitality offerings including branded hotel residences like Ritz-Carlton's Diriyah properties are being showcased at international pop-ups such as Harrods in London, targeting Saudi luxury buyers abroad. Luxury consumption supports non-oil GDP and generates employment. As Saudis spend domestically on high-end fashion, autos, hospitality and entertainment, more money remains in the national economy, supporting jobs in retail, hospitality, media and logistics. Women and youth leading luxury markets indicate greater inclusion and evolving cultural norms. Women shopping or driving luxury purchases signal stronger economic agency and lifestyle autonomy. Luxury brands such as Gucci, Tiffany, Prada and Dolce & Gabbana are opening flagship stores and expanding in Riyadh and Diriyah, indicating confidence in long-term demand and regulatory clarity. Riyadh is emerging as a serious rival to Dubai in the GCC luxury sector. With new megamalls like Solitaire and The Avenues under development, Saudi's luxury market is projected to nearly double expenditure by 2030. Despite strong growth, retail space remains limited. With several mega malls in early or mid‑development stage, Riyadh may face temporary oversupply once enterprise scale begins . Maintaining Saudi cultural identity while accommodating global luxury can be a delicate balancing act. Projects like VIA Riyadh aim to integrate tradition with modern luxury through design, programming and cultural integration. Younger consumers are increasingly value-driven and eco-conscious. Luxury brands must adapt with sustainability reporting, transparency and circular economy products to meet expectation. Riyadh's luxury transformation reflects more than conspicuous consumption, it signals a transformative shift in Saudi Arabia's economic base, social norms and global identity. High-end retail, digital engagement, infrastructure investment, and socially inclusive trends are combining to reshape Riyadh into a next-gen luxury destination. As Vision 2030 progresses, Riyadh's rise in luxury will continue to reflect the Kingdom's ambition—be it red carpets, retail marquees or cultural reopening."

Once we did the hard work making it trendy, all the big brands moved in to try and capitalize on it. Now they want to clean up the image so that braindead consumers aren't scared of spending big yennies at the Gucci store by people actually having a good time hanging around drinking on the street.

mov_250AB0AFEAF58001DD227BC55DC12700,2025-07-13 08:30:00,en,WEB,"  ""My husband and I have always gone along with it, even though it's felt a bit much at times,"" a Reddit user wrote of their friends' gift-giving traditions Brenton Blanchet Link copied Edward Berthelot/Getty Stock image of a woman in Italy carrying a Gucci bag in June 2025 NEED TO KNOW A Reddit user is asking for advice after a friend expected her to pitch in for lavish birthday gifts, including a Gucci bag The woman revealed on the platform's 'Am I the A------' forum that a friend told her he expected her to pay for an expensive dinner bill after she didn't help pay for a group gift ""Suddenly we're being labeled as the rude ones just because we made a different choice this time based on our current situation,"" she wrote A woman is reconsidering her friend group's expectations for gift-giving — and she's asking the internet for some advice. On Wednesday, July 9, a 29-year-old woman revealed on Reddit's popular ""Am I the A-----e"" forum that she and her husband, 35, are part of ""a close group of friends"" who often celebrate birthdays together. And while the ""birthday person"" usually ""hosts and pays for everyone,"" things have been different lately, she explained. ""About a year ago, this weird new tradition started,"" the original poster wrote. ""For each birthday, someone opens a WhatsApp group and says, 'Let's all chip in for this really expensive gift.' We're talking about things like Hermes flip-flops, Formula 1 tickets, Gucci bags. It's all very public and a bit uncomfortable to say no."" The Redditor continued, ""My husband and I have always gone along with it, even though it's felt a bit much at times. For example, we paid around €300 towards a €1,500 Formula 1 ticket for my husband's best friend, let's call him Tom."" Never miss a story — sign up for PEOPLE's free daily newsletter to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer​​, from celebrity news to compelling human interest stories. Edward Berthelot/Getty Stock image of a woman carrying a Gucci bag in June 2025 in Paris While it felt ""OK"" at the time, the couple — who are already parents to one child and trying for another — has since opened a new, self-funded business. And now, they no longer feel comfortable taking part in the ""expensive group gifts."" When her husband's birthday came around weeks back, the woman opted to not start a WhatsApp group. Without a gift to pitch in for, Tom gave the husband a ""nice bottle of tequila worth around €100,"" or roughly $116. Two weeks later, it was time for Tom's girlfriend's birthday. And while Tom opened a group chat, the Reddit user and her husband instead opted to buy her a €120 massage voucher as a gift, worth around $140. ""Her birthday was held at a really fancy and expensive beach restaurant. We went, enjoyed the event, had fun and made sure the birthday girl had a blast,"" the original poster wrote. ""A few days later, Tom wrote in the group that the bill was €3,000 and said that if anyone would like to contribute, they could. I told my husband I didn't want to chip in. We didn't choose the place. We gave her a gift. And again, we're being more mindful about money right now. He obviously agreed."" Tom saw things differently. As the woman explained, the friend privately messaged her husband and said he ""expected us to help with the dinner bill since we didn't join the group gift."" ""He said our €100 gift wasn't enough, brought up the fact that we had always participated before, including for his Formula 1 ticket, and said we were being jerks for not pitching in at all this time,"" she wrote. ""I honestly don't understand it. I've never once complained about the gifts we got. I've always been thankful. But suddenly we're being labeled as the rude ones just because we made a different choice this time based on our current situation."" Ultimately, other Reddit users wrote that they felt the original poster wasn't the ""a------"" in the situation, with the most-upvoted response reading that ""serving you with a bill after the fact, without informing you before the event that this would be expected is not a fair friendly move."" ""If Tom wants to buy expensive gucci bags to his girlfriend and plan 3K dinners, that's great, but he can't expect the same level of chipping in from everyone else,"" the user wrote. ""It's his girlfriend, not everyone's. If Tom was a good friend he wouldn't have stepped on multiple boundaries and calling you 'jerks?' ... For not paying for his ideas."" Getty Stock photo of a dinner party As for the couple, they ""realized we might not have been as clear as we thought"" after seeing Reddit's response and opted to send the following message to their friends: ""Hi guys, first of all, we love you all...."

mov_28C925C715504CA5F957DCCFDDCB2B6D,2025-07-13 11:30:00,en,WEB,"  The millionaire next door simply doesn't make headlines. He or she has probably built their fortune in a mundane and boring way and lives an equally understated lifestyle. These are the “stealthy wealthy” and their habits hold powerful lessons for anyone serious about financial freedom. Here are the top seven habits you could replicate to boost your financial position or peace of mind. The cardinal rule of the stealthy wealthy is to conceal your fortune (or at least not flaunt it) so that you can enjoy it in complete privacy. That means no flashy toys or glamorous status symbols that call your wealth to attention. A quietly rich person isn't likely to buy a Gucci belt or Birkin handbag. In fact, it's the middle class consumers, presumably trying to signal their affluence, who account for more than half of all global luxury brand sales, according to the Wall Street Journal. Put simply, you don't need to prove your wealth to anyone if you already have plenty of it. Avoid the status symbols and shop based on value and durability instead. Contrary to the stereotype, millionaires and multimillionaires are not all driving around in Aston Martins or Bugattis. In fact, Dave Ramsey's survey of millionaires across America found that the top three most popular brands were Toyota, Honda, and Ford. Picking a practical and relatively inexpensive car is perhaps the best way to retain your fortune rather than burning it off through a sports car's tailpipe. Making decisions in the most tax-efficient way is how most wealthy people retain their fortune and continue to expand it. Although your tax situation might be very different from someone with a seven- or eight-figure net worth, that doesn't mean you can afford to neglect tax planning. Take a page out of the stealthy wealthy playbook and hire the best accountants and tax planners to help you minimize your liabilities. A survey by Northwestern Mutual found that a whopping 84% of wealthy individuals had a financial plan, compared to just 52% for the general public. In other words, rich people are simply more intentional with their saving and spending. Adopting this proactive approach means telling your money what to do instead of helplessly reacting to the amount of money left in your account after you're done spending. Start with a budget and update it frequently as you make progress on your financial journey. Stealth wealth is rooted in a deep respect for privacy. By keeping your finances discreet, you not only protect yourself from fraud and financial crimes, but also improve your chances of securing better deals and avoiding tension in personal relationships because “you can afford it.” The stealthy wealthy, according to the Wall Street Journal, were most likely to make their fortunes in relatively overlooked and mundane niches of the economy. Think cup holder manufacturers, commercial carpet cleaning or industrial appliance maintenance. Put simply, most successful entrepreneurs and investors are not chasing the latest hype cycle and are instead focused on lucrative, always-on industries with sparse competition. If you're trying to build wealth too, stop trying to build a billion-dollar AI tech startup and focus on something more practical and mundane. A single source of income, perhaps from your full-time job, is rarely sufficient to build wealth — especially these days. To reach the top you need a diversified pool of multiple income sources. Consider a side gig to boost your income and invest in passive income opportunities such as real estate or dividend stocks to get your financial goals faster.

Star Wars sucked, but it is not really his fault. 2021 [*The Last Duel*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Duel_(2021_film)) was brilliant. Gucci and Ferrari were both decent.

1lz0ymi,2025-07-13 19:07:14,en,REDDIT,"  Moderator announcement! Reddit only allows us to pin 2-3 posts at a time, which is limiting how well we can coordinate activity on the sub. For example, in situations when we have 2 megathreads running at a time and an upcoming CU meetup needs advertising, there is no space for pinning anything else. We are planning to create a permanently pinned post that simultaneously works as a general discussion and off-topic megathread, a directory of links, and an announcement board. The post will have the`GRILL ZONE` flair, so anyone will be able to comment, regardless of karma, account age, or flair. It will be named the Technofeudal Town Square, and its content will be maintained by a town crier account that will be shared between several mods. We have several ideas for what the Town Square should contain. If you have any feedback or any additional ideas as to its contents, leave a comment below. Mods - let's discuss this here instead of in modmail. Our ideas are: * Links to the latest WW3 megathread, active meme threads such as [the LLM accusation thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/stupidpol/comments/1l1ojo6/grillzone_the_singularity/) (rip), and any other event megathreads we have such as election megathreads. No more pinned comments redirecting to other megathreads. * Links to recent debate threads. * A link to the flair thread. * Links to upcoming AMAs, recent mod announcements. * Links to organizing initiatives, stuff like the Alden Capital saga. * An obituary section listing regular users whose accounts were suspended by gigajannies. * Maybe new mod intros if we're feeling cheesy. * Links to historical threads, such as the one containing Gucci era pre-coup modmail logs. Oldheads feel free to suggest these. Any time the town square post gets updated with something significant we'll make a locked, standalone announcement post to attract attention. The other pinned post slots will be primarily dedicated to quality content that we want the sub to engage with."

Der erst 23-jährige Tennis-Star aus Italien hat mit diesem Triumph seine weiter gefestigt. Dieser Sieg markiert seinen vierten Grand-Slam-Titel nach den Erfolgen bei den Open 2024 und 2025 sowie und den US Open im Jahr 2024. Allein im Jahr 2024 erzielte der Italiener ein Preisgeld von insgesamt 19.735.703 US-Dollar (etwa 18,8 Euro), was ihn zum Spitzenverdiener der ATP-Tour machte. Als Wimbledon-Sieger erhält Jannik Sinner jetzt ein von 3 Millionen britischen Pfund, was umgerechnet rund 3,53 Millionen Euro entspricht. Damit ist der Siegerscheck um 11 Prozent höher als im Vorjahr und markiert ein neues Rekordniveau. Insgesamt schüttet das Turnier in diesem Jahr mehr als 53,5 Millionen Pfund aus – der höchste Gesamtpreispool in der Geschichte von Wimbledon. Zum Vergleich: Schon das Erreichen der ersten Runde wird mit 66.000 Pfund (77.600 Euro) vergütet. Wimbledon bleibt damit nicht nur eines der traditionsreichsten, sondern auch eines der lukrativsten Tennisturniere der Welt. Schon in seinen jungen Jahren hat Sinner mit den hohen Preisgeldern ein beachtliches Vermögen angehäuft. Hinzu kommen außerdem noch etwaige Sponsorengelder, insbesondere von italienischen Unternehmen. Bereits im Jahr 2022 unterzeichnete er einen 10-Jahres-Vertrag mit Nike im Wert von 150 Millionen US-Dollar. Zudem ist er globaler und repräsentiert Marken wie Gucci, Lavazza, Alfa Romeo und Technogym. Glaubt man den Schätzungen der , beläuft sich Vermögen des jungen Spielers mittlerweile auf rund 50 Millionen Euro. Diese Partnerschaften tragen maßgeblich zu seinem geschätzten Vermögen von über 50 Millionen Euro bei. In seiner italienischen Heimat ist der 23-Jährige auch immer wieder in verschiedenen Werbespots zu sehen. Sein Aufstieg in der Tenniswelt ist bemerkenswert. Im Jahr 2024 erreichte er als erster Italiener die Nummer eins der ATP-Weltrangliste. Er gewann sowohl die Australian Open als auch die US Open. Mit seinem jüngsten Sieg in Wimbledon 2025 festigte er seine Position an der Weltspitze. Der 23-Jährige demonstrierte damit einmal mehr seine außergewöhnlichen Fähigkeiten auf dem Platz."

Quando aparece, a modelo desfila com um lenço de seda estampado, amarrado como uma bandana em referência ao glamour dos anos 90.  Em tempos associado a ícones como Grace Kelly, Audrey Hepburn e Jackie Kennedy, este acessório está de volta. Agora, porém, surge nos looks contemporâneos de it girls como Kendall Jenner, Hailey Bieber ou Alexa Chung, que o usam de diversas formas. Ao contrário do passado, porém, já não são apenas as versões com efeito acetinado que cumprem o seu propósito no guarda-roupa feminino. A variedade de estilos é cada vez maior, com opções mais arrojadas e coloridas a chegarem ao catálogo de marcas como a Bimba y Lola. Um dos usos mais comuns é ao pescoço. Nos saldos da marca espanhola, encontramos um lenço que se destaca pelo tigre estampado sobre um fundo ocre. Entre estrelas e riscas, destaca-se o estilo algo inocente do desenho que irá dar mais personalidade a qualquer look, independentemente da forma como o escolher usar. O uso mais popular é na cabeça, para prender o cabelo ou até mesmo para intercalar em tranças, mas há também quem opte por colocá-lo como uma bandolete. É ainda comum vê-lo no pescoço, como cinto ou até como crop top. Outras utilizações mais subtis passam por colocá-lo no pulso com propósito decorativo,  quando não lhe apetecer carregar com algo mais pesado, ou num outro acessório como uma carteira. Se estiver a usar um modelo mais monótono, pode dar-lhe outro aspeto com um simples pedaço de tecido. O lenço custava 58€ no site da Bimba y Lola, mas pode comprá-lo por 29€ graças a um desconto de 50 por cento. Carregue na galeria para conhecer a seleção da NiT de casacos em saldos, com propostas de várias marcas, estilos e preços (a partir de 9,99€)."
