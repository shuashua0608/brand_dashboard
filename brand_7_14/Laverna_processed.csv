Despite his football fame, Wilson has always made time for family and celebrated every little milestone with them. Don Vito Corleone once said that a man who doesn't spend time with his family can never be a real man. And that's not just an iconic movie quote. For Wilson and his new Giants crew, that seems to be code to live by. Following his QB's routes off the field, the man who came to New York to take the reins from Saquon Barkley is carving out a similar story for himself. For Giants' RB Tyrone Tracy Jr., his family has been the driving force behind his rise to NFL glory. From his mom, Laverna's rallying war cry of ‚ÄúGo Tracy! Go Tracy!‚Äù to showing up with a tee that sported a Rise up 'Tracy Boys' print, she's done it all. Even his dad, Tyrone Tracy Sr., would take the whole fam to different national tournaments as vacations. Even Tracy Jr.'s brother, Javon, had once noted, ‚Äúwe've probably been to about 35 states that were just straight sports.‚Äù And that driving force is helping him run routes on the gridiron now. As per the latest post on the NYGiants IG page, ‚ÄúFamily is everything for Tyrone Tracy Jr. ‚Äù In a heartfelt clip featuring Tracy, he talked about the bond with his family, and how they've been with him every step of the way. ‚ÄúAll of my memories is really surrounded by family. Anytime we got together, we always was laughing and creating memories. I was raised by both parents in my house. I have three brothers. My parents didn't miss a game. Like, we all play sports. They didn't miss a thing. They was always there.‚Äù Tracy also talked about how his mom kept the whole family grounded in faith. Expand Post Tracy Sr. worked two jobs, one as a FedEx Driver and the other as the owner of Tyrone's Lawn Service. He still managed to be there for every single game for his boys, with Laverna cheering them on by his side. And for his fam, Tracy Jr. has a singular mission that he's carving out in his career. As he put it, ‚ÄúEvery time I go on this football field, like, I see my family in the stands or watching it on TV or whatever. Like, I'll make sure that they hear my name or come across that screen. ‚Äì I want them to reap each and every benefit that I have. Like, that's my why. ‚Äì I want to prove the people that believed in me since day one. I want to prove every single one of them right every time I step on the football field.‚Äù After Barkley left for Philly last year, the Big Blue had David Singletary and Tracy Jr. to fill the gap. In his rookie year, Tyrone posted clean numbers with 192 carries for 839 yards. Add to that 5 TDs and even a tackle, and the man looks promising. With his family driving him to greatness, will he be able to make the Giants forget the ghosts of the past? While Tyrone works to make that a reality, his QB already has a designated weapon to deliver blows with this season. Russell Wilson's weapon of choice for the season Coming away from Steel City, Russell Wilson had quite a few reasons to land with the Giants. Getting to work with the mind of HC Brian Daboll certainly has its perks. There's also the added incentive of a chance to bring the fifth Lombardi Trophy to New York. But the biggest reason for Wilson being in New York was a single name. WR Malik Nabers. As Wilson had noted at the Fanatics Fest recently, ‚ÄúYou know, I came here because of him. Big reason of it. You know, I really wanted to play with a guy special like him.‚Äù..."

The Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy found that undocumented immigrants paid $96.7 BILLION in federal, state, and local taxes in 2022‚Äî that's over $8,800 PER person‚Äîincluding payroll taxes for Social Security and Medicare. A 2007 Congressional Budget Office review stated that, over the long term, immigrants (BOTH legal and unauthorized) pay more in taxes than they consume in public services at the national level."

I don't want to see people in our community loose jobs. Our taxes are paying for congress salaries and benefits,  they never seem to do anything about them except give themselves raises. I  don't know one person, who pays taxes on social security,  must be some that makes big bucks besides it. I appreciate you asking me out of all the comments,  which was on some one else's post, not yours. And love how you liked your own post üòÜ Have a great day. p.s. I am an American,  I've worked my whole life,  until I retired, without any assistance from the government. But some people really need a helping hand sometimes,  I hope you never have to find out first hand."

No taxes on tips unless they're cash tips they will still be taxed. No taxes on social Security the only person that helps is people who made a whole lot of money because they were the only people taxed to begin with. And Medicaid trust me you must not know anybody that has children or middle or lower class middle class that uses Medicaid because those are the people being cut the illegals are all being thrown out of country by masked men. So before you go Spouting about how great this is you really need to think it through

There is still tax on social security, just a higher threshold. There is still tax on tips, it just can't knock you into a higher tax bracket. It sure will take away a bunch of Healthcare and the major tax breaks are mainly for the top 20% of earners...but yes.... the rest of us will get some tax breaks....and 2-5 trillion more debt..."

Since I am celebrating my 70th birthday later this month, this focus was a natural for me. Most people recognize collagen for it's role in skin and hair care - especially as we age. But college affects far more that our skin and hair - as noted in this quotation taken from an online article posted by The Cleveland Clinic. https://share.google/YSN7onJmkUuvxPbQc     ""Collagen is the most abundant protein in your body. It accounts for about 30% of your body's total protein. Collagen is the primary building block of your body's skin, muscles, bones, tendons and ligaments, and other connective tissues. It's also found in your organs, blood vessels and intestinal lining."" Collagen production tends to decrease as we age so this is naturally when most people start to notice it (or the lack thereof). Genetic conditions, such as  Ehlers Danlos syndrome (some forms of which are life threatening),  create collagen challenges from birth. When collagen levels are inadequate to function as they should, all kinds of fun things can happen to make life interesting. There are the obvious wrinkles, thinning hair, and fragile nails. There are the  unstable joints and weakened muscles which create mobility and dexterity issues. There are circulation and breathing issues as  blood vessels and airways lose elasticity and stability. There is even  vertigo caused by the weakness of the connective tissues that are supposed to be supporting the small bones in our inner ears. There is pain, often excruciating pain, from muscle cramps to migraines to intestinal issues and more. (Fortunately pain is something that seldom  affects me, personally). There is no magic pill or medical intervention available to 'fix' collagen synthesis deficiencies. For now, the only treatments available deal with  managing the symptoms and  the health issues caused by the collagen failure. But, there is good news! A lifestyle focussed on exercise, diet, and stress management can do a lot to increase collagen production and efficiency in our bodies - especially if aging or benign collagen disorders is the root cause. Since this blog is my Daily Food Diary, I will be highlighting foods that are rich in collagen and foods that support collagen synthesis within our bodies. Because much of my Health and Wellness Journey, that I started three and a third  years ago, involves fitness and stress management, I will be touching on them regularly as well - especially as they relate to collagen production and dealing with collagen deficiency issues. Me and our dog Molly, who is a BIG part of my fit & healthy lifestyle.

How many people do you know that go long form and itemizes their deductions? Or do they go short form and take the standardized deductions? If you don't go long form, then you cannot take advantage of that no tax on tips...it is just useless verbiage to make you believe he was trying to help the working person. Also the only tax break on Social security is if you make over $75,000 single income or $150,000 for couples. Thank  President Trump for taking away from those who need help and giving to those that don't?"
