mov_92BD267FC0AA8B7E5BDAC6B6A1B3E34F,2025-06-14 15:01:02,en,WEB,"  Fun in the sun, coming right up 1. Baby Bum SPF 50 Sunscreen, a must-have for parents and their littles — it's unscented, moisturizing, 100% mineral based, vegan, cruelty free, and dye free. It'll certainly get the job done! I use this on my kids all the time! In a pinch, I've used it on myself as well. It rubs in easily (thankfully because putting sunscreen on kids is a TASK and a half) and smells nicely of coconut. I also use Sun Bum's Sunscreen Stick on my son's face, which is equally fantastic, because it's easier to apply in a pinch than a cream. Note: Based on the AAD Guidelines all sunscreens should have an SPF of at least 30 and protect against UVA and UVB rays. Additionally, sunscreen is only made for children over the age of 6 months. Promising review: ""This is the only mineral sunscreen I will use or put on my children. It's the only brand I've tried that goes on smooth and not super thick, and doesn't leave a white residue. Works great and no harmful ingredients, what's not to love!"" —Natalie Anderson Get it from Amazon for $16.49. 2. And a sunscreen applicator that'll make covering your mini-me from head to toe a whole lot easier — especially if they're squirmy! Pour the lotion inside this travel size container, flip it upside down, shake it, and apply. No mess and no stress. Check out how easy it is to apply sunscreen with this clever gadget in this TikTok. Solar Buddies is a small business based in the UK, founded by two moms, who set out to develop a product that would make applying sunscreen on kiddos easier. As a parent myself, I can confirm this gadget is fantastic. During the summer I'd keep one in my diaper bag to ensure my son was protected from the sun at any given moment. He loved being ""painted"" and I loved knowing applying sunscreen wasn't going to be a fight. Promising review: ""I hesitated, but I originally saw this item on TikTok and knew it would make life SO MUCH easier when it comes to putting sunscreen on myself and my kids, and I have to say, I am NOT disappointed!! The sunscreen goes on so smoothly and evenly, and I feel like I will be saving so much sunscreen now that I'm not just squirting a huge glob in my hands and spending so much time trying to rub in a ridiculous amount into mine and my children's skin. My only regret with buying these is that I wish I would have bought a couple more so that I could have different ones for each of the sunscreens we use! But I will be recommending these to everyone!"" —Carmen Get a pack of two from Amazon for $27.98+ (available in four colors and in three-packs). 3. Plus Supergoop Glowscreen for *your* exposed skin — it actually protects skin (hellooooo SPF 40) while making it shimmer just like Edward freakin' Cullen in the sunlight. I adore this sunscreen! I'm very fair skinned and prone to getting sunburnt, so I have to stay very on top of applying SPF at all times. This one isn't greasy at all, blends in immediately, and LITERALLY adds shimmery sparkles wherever its applied. I truly don't even mind putting it on — it's a welcome addition to my skincare routine. Promising review: ""I absolutely love this sunscreen. I'm always wary of 'for everyone' tinted products because they aren't usually made with us in mind. But this one hits the mark. It looks amazing on my brown skin. Non-streaky, no white cast. It gives my skin a subtle shimmer. The video and pics are in direct sunlight so you can see it in full effect. For reference, I have combination, thirty-something-year-old skin. Glowscreen is officially in my skincare rotation."" —Lovely91 Get it from Amazon for $38. 4. Playful clips that are as practical as they are pretty — they'll hold your towel in place on your chair so you won't have to chase it across the pool deck and can focus on more important things like sipping on a Diet Coke and making sure your tyke isn't peeing in the kiddie pool. Promising review: ""This set comes with four clips...."
mov_C06B823198EF22EDC201310C149D906F,2025-06-15 14:31:03,en,WEB,"  Instead of the usual tears you shed when stocking up on Supergoop sunscreen, Too Faced mascara, and Lululemon workout gear. 1. Buttery soft high-waisted leggings giving Lululemon and other pricey brands a run for their money, according to some reviewers. They're squat-proof, stretchy, and actually stay up without rolling down! Promising reviews: ""I can't say enough great things about these leggings! They don't roll down, and they feel amazing on. I have all kinds of brands Lululemon, Vuori, Athleta, etc. and these are my favorites and the ones I feel the best and most confident in!! And you can't beat the price — it's a win-win. I will be back to purchase even more colors!"" —Lauren ""The stitching and logo placement is similar to Lulu; however, these feel more compressive and thicker than Aligns, which I prefer. Lulu stretches over time and for a fraction of the price, this entire line feels way better."" —Fiona Get them from Amazon for $29+ (available in women's sizes XXS–XXL, two inseams, and 22 colors). 2. A Renpho percussion massager here to save the day because that $300 TheraGun just isn't in the budget rn. It has five different head attachments for targeting different muscle groups, plus five speeds to customize the intensity. Your sore muscles, tense neck, and deep knots are ready for some much-needed relief. Promising reviews: ""Helps with pain relief and massage in pressure spots I wasn't able to get before. I had access to use a TheraGun before and haven't noticed any difference between items, and it's at a much lower price point. Whatever extra TheraGun features there might be, I haven't needed and the heads are interchangeable between TheraGun and this. Very happy with my purchase."" —tauntaun ""I used a TheraGun for about a month and although it was great, this unit is better suited for my needs. I found the TheraGun to be too powerful on the lowest setting and bulky to handle. Some people prefer a lower setting than the 'professional' brand offers. This unit is also easier to handle when massaging my partner than the TheraGun. This gun goes from comfortable low setting to very powerful on the highest setting. Much better fit for me and my partner, plus it's got a solid battery life."" —Pierremoe Get it from Amazon for $74.99 (available in seven colors). 3. E.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen if you're still trying to find a daily sunscreen you don't hate. This clear gel sunscreen offers SPF 35 and goes on so smooth and lightweight, you'll immediately forget you're wearing it — no white cast here, folks. It doubles as a blurring primer, so it's great for wearing under makeup too! If you love Supergoop but the price is becoming hard to swallow...may I suggest trying this, because it's *very* similar. The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop's cult-fave product end. I've tried both, and I honestly prefer this E.l.f. version. Supergoop's had a slight graininess to it that I didn't love, while this E.l.f. sunscreen is exactly what I'd hoped Supergoop's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top! Promising review: ""This sunscreen is a gem. I was not expecting to love it as much as I do. I absolutely love E.l.f. products, but I rarely try their skincare. Something told me to try this...."
mov_CB62F90E2DD16CF6C8948AE885344FE2,2025-06-15 15:31:02,en,WEB,"  If the word ""SPF"" lights your fire, you're about to get reeeeeally excited about this cult-fave SPF 50 lip gloss and hydrating SPF 50 moisturizer. 1. Solarcaine Aloe Sunburn Relief Spray for when those sunburns aren't just an ""ouch"" but a full on ""YIKES!"" This is designed for fast-acting, long-lasting relief from burning, pain, *and* itching, so it will be your secret weapon for summer sunburns, scrapes, and bug bites. Read more about lidocaine and pain relief at Cleveland Clinic. Promising review: ""I brought this with me on a cruise, and I'm so glad I did! After a little too much sun on the deck, this spray was a total lifesaver. It provided instant cooling relief and took the sting out of my sunburn right away. The spray made it easy to apply without having to rub it in — perfect for those sensitive areas. The aloe was super soothing, and the lidocaine helped calm the burn fast. It absorbed quickly and didn't leave any sticky feeling behind. Definitely a must-have for any sunny vacation or cruise — I'll never travel without it again!"" —Barbara Get it from Amazon for $7.99. 2. Black Girl Sunscreen's Make It Pop Sungloss with SPF 50 (!!) that reviewers *adore* both as a glossy shine on bare lips, or to make their signature lippies pop. Who knew sun protection could look so chic? Black Girl Sunscreen is a Black-owned small business that specializes in sun-protective products that don't leave a white cast. Promising review: ""Best SPF lip gloss I've tried at a price you can't beat. It keeps your lips moisturized long after it's applied and has no white cast. I also have fairly sensitive skin and this has yet to cause any irritation on my lips which is a huge plus. It's generally impossible to find SPF 50 in any lip product, let alone in a gloss — I will purchase again for sure."" —Ashlee Meckler Get it from Amazon for $9.99. 3. A delightfully affordable instant foot peeling spray for anyone whose feet are ready for a lil' bit of love after all their summer hikes and sandal-wearing. This not only helps gently remove dead skin, but moisturizes dry and cracked heels, so you'll really get some refreshing bang for your buck. Promising review: ""This product delivers exactly as promised and is incredibly easy to use. I suffer from dry skin and often apply various products to soften my feet. With this, I simply spray it on and immediately massage it in with my hands. The dead skin comes off effortlessly. There's no waiting time, and it's gentle on the skin. It leaves my feet feeling exceptionally soft. This has quickly become my new favorite thing."" —KimT Get it from Amazon for $5.48. 4. A set of limited edition Band-Aids with retro flower patterns so the next time you get a little ouch, you can be like, ""wound care, but make it summer-y."" Promising review: ""Cute, retro, and good quality. Perfect for summertime cuts and scrapes. Comes with three sizes in the box, each in a different pattern."" —R&M Get a pack of 30 from Amazon for $3.77. 5. A two-in-one nausea relief inhaler designed to work FAST on spontaneous nausea, motion sickness, morning sickness, and general queasiness (having a human body is hard). Summer road trips and cruises just got a HECK of a lot more bearable. You can either use it as a scent inhaler or rub it directly on the tip of your nose for relief. Promising review: ""Took this on my first cruise. Anytime that I started to feel woozy I'd reach for it...."

Glowscreen SPF 40 Sunscreen with Hyaluronic Acid + Niacinamide Chevron Chevron 8/12 Supergoop! Glowscreen SPF 40 Sunscreen with Hyaluronic Acid + Niacinamide $38 Amazon $38 Sephora $38 Blue Mercury Pro makeup artist Judi Gabbay tells Glamour that Supergoop's Glowscreen is the “easiest way to get glowing, natural, and protected skin.” The SPF 40 formula counts brightening antioxidants and nourishing ingredients like hyaluronic acid, vitamin B5, and niacinamide among its star ingredients for “a natural, glowy radiance,” says Gabbay. “Despite editing beauty content for the past 15 or so years, I'm not a makeup girlie, which is why I adore this sunscreen so much,” says Brie Schwartz, Glamour's director of commerce. “It functions like a lightweight foundation, blurring pores and giving me a literal freshly tanned glow as if I put highlighter in all the right places. And it requires no technique to apply (unlike makeup). I even wear it to the office on days I want to look more finished.” One word of caution: “If your face is going to be exposed to the sun for an extended period of time (wear a hat, folks!) , this chemical sunscreen is not quite as powerful as mineral sunscreen,” says Schwartz. Type: Chemical / Active ingredients: Avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene / Other key ingredients: Hyaluronic acid, vitamin B5, niacinamide, sea lavender, cocoa peptides / SPF: 40What we love: Comes in multiple shades; a little goes a long wayWhat could improve: Some users say they don't think the SPF protection is as strong as some others."

ca064a774462cd32aecb5cf64f0e6e15,2025-06-19 13:34:00,en,WEB,"  Hand Cream Market Size is Expected to Reach USD 784.5 Million By 2033 | CAGR: 4.81% 06-19-2025 02:09 PM CET | Advertising, Media Consulting, Marketing Research Press release from: IMARC Group Hand Cream Market Market Overview: The hand cream market is experiencing rapid growth, driven by rising awareness of skincare and hygiene, demand for natural and organic products, and innovation in product formulations and packaging. According to IMARC Group's latest research publication, ""Hand Cream Market: Global Industry Trends, Share, Size, Growth, Opportunity and Forecast 2025-2033"", The global hand cream market size reached USD 490.4 Million in 2024. Looking forward, IMARC Group expects the market to reach USD 784.5 Million by 2033, exhibiting a growth rate (CAGR) of 4.81% during 2025-2033. This detailed analysis primarily encompasses industry size, business trends, market share, key growth factors, and regional forecasts. The report offers a comprehensive overview and integrates research findings, market assessments, and data from different sources. It also includes pivotal market dynamics like drivers and challenges, while also highlighting growth opportunities, financial insights, technological improvements, emerging trends, and innovations. Besides this, the report provides regional market evaluation, along with a competitive landscape analysis. Grab a sample PDF of this report: https://www.imarcgroup.com/hand-cream-market/requestsample Our report includes: ● Market Dynamics ● Market Trends And Market Outlook ● Competitive Analysis ● Industry Segmentation ● Strategic Recommendations Growth Factors in the Hand Cream Market ● Rising Awareness of Skincare and Hygiene: Increasing consumer awareness of skincare and hygiene is a significant growth factor in the hand cream market. People are becoming more educated about the importance of maintaining healthy skin, especially on their hands, which are exposed to environmental stressors like UV rays, pollution, and frequent washing. This awareness has been amplified by global health campaigns emphasizing hand hygiene, particularly during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. For example, brands like L'Occitane have capitalized on this trend by promoting their shea butter hand creams as both moisturizing and protective, appealing to consumers seeking products that align with their heightened focus on self-care and skin health. Social media platforms, such as Instagram and TikTok, further drive this trend by showcasing skincare routines, encouraging consumers to invest in premium hand creams. ● Demand for Natural and Organic Products: The growing preference for natural and organic products is fueling the hand cream market's expansion. Consumers are increasingly wary of synthetic chemicals like parabens and sulfates, opting instead for formulations with plant-based ingredients, such as aloe vera, coconut oil, or essential oils. This shift is driven by a broader movement toward sustainability and eco-conscious purchasing decisions. For instance, Burt's Bees has gained popularity with its beeswax-based hand creams, marketed as environmentally friendly and free from harmful additives. Retailers like Whole Foods and Sephora have also expanded their natural skincare sections, making these products more accessible. This trend reflects a cultural shift toward holistic wellness, boosting demand for clean-label hand creams. ● Innovation in Product Formulations and Packaging: Continuous innovation in product formulations and packaging is a key driver of the hand cream market. Brands are developing specialized creams targeting specific concerns, such as anti-aging, hyperpigmentation, or extra-dry skin, to cater to diverse consumer needs. Additionally, convenient and aesthetically pleasing packaging, like travel-sized tubes or sleek dispensers, enhances product appeal. For example, Neutrogena's Norwegian Formula Hand Cream offers concentrated hydration in compact packaging, ideal for on-the-go use. Companies are also experimenting with eco-friendly packaging, such as biodegradable tubes, to attract environmentally conscious buyers. These innovations not only improve user experience but also differentiate brands in a competitive market, driving consumer loyalty and sales. Key Trends in the Hand Cream Market ● Premiumization and Luxury Branding: The trend toward premiumization is reshaping the hand cream market, with consumers willing to invest in high-end products that offer a luxurious experience. Premium hand creams often feature exotic ingredients, sophisticated fragrances, and elegant packaging, positioning them as status symbols. For instance, Dior's Miss Dior Hand Cream combines skincare with its iconic floral scent, appealing to luxury beauty enthusiasts. Department stores like Nordstrom and high-end retailers like Net-a-Porter have seen increased sales of such products, as consumers treat hand creams as indulgent self-care items. This trend is particularly strong among millennials and Gen Z, who value experiential purchases and share their luxury finds on social media. ● Growth of Gender-Neutral and Inclusive Products: The rise of gender-neutral and inclusive products is a prominent trend in the hand cream market. Traditional marketing often targeted women, but brands are now creating unisex formulations to appeal to all genders, focusing on functionality over stereotyped aesthetics. For example, Aesop's Reverence Aromatique Hand Balm, with its minimalist packaging and universal appeal, has become a favorite among diverse demographics. This shift aligns with broader societal moves toward inclusivity, encouraging brands to use neutral scents and avoid gendered language in marketing...."

BEST VALUE TINTED MOISTURIZER WITH SPF Sun Bum Daily Glow Tinted Sunscreen Moisturizer SPF 30 Read moreBEST TINTED MOISTURIZER WITH SPF FOR DARK SKIN TONES La Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral Tinted Sunscreen SPF 50 Read more Wearing sunscreen is non-negotiable; protecting your complexion from the sun's harmful rays is paramount for skin health and to combat the signs of aging. Thankfully, there are so many multitasking, sun-protective formulas on the market, like tinted moisturizers with SPF. These skincare innovators provide coverage in two ways: evening out discoloration and protecting skin from UV damage. The latter is crucial for all skin types and skin tones. Not only is sun exposure the leading cause of premature skin aging (like fine lines, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, dark spots, and loss of elasticity), but it can also cause skin cancer, which can be deadly, says Corey L. Hartman, M.D., F.A.A.D., board-certified dermatologist and founder of Skin Wellness Dermatology in Birmingham, AL Meet the experts: Sonia Batra, M.D., board-certified dermatologist and co-host of The Doctors; and Corey L. Hartman, M.D., F.A.A.D., board-certified dermatologist and founder of Skin Wellness Dermatology in Birmingham, AL “A tinted moisturizer with SPF is a great multitasker—it hydrates, provides sun protection, and can even out skin tone in one step. The tint helps blur imperfections, while the SPF (ideally 30 or higher) protects against UV damage and visible light,” explains Sonia Batra, M.D., board-certified dermatologist and co-host of The Doctors. “This is especially helpful for those with hyperpigmentation. It's an easy way to simplify your routine without sacrificing skin health.” Below, find the best tinted moisturizers with SPF for every skin type and concern, recommended by experts and tested by editors. Supergoop! Protec(tint) Daily Skin Tint SPF 50 Pros - Blendable formula - Flexible shades - Made with skincare ingredients Cons - Some say its not suitable for acne-prone skin This SPF tint is a “popular option that offers broad spectrum protection that is easy to incorporate into your daily skincare routine,” says Dr. Hartman. “The formula is lightweight, so you can use it all over the face, which is important when you are applying an SPF product—you want to go everywhere.” What a reviewer thinks: “This is my favorite product from Supergoop! It looks flawless and has protected me from burning, even in extreme heat and sunlight. It looks better than some expensive foundations, and it reduces the number of layers I need to put on my face when getting ready,” wrote one Sephora reviewer. “It lasts for hours despite sweating, and I like to touch it up with Supergoop's translucent powder.” Key ingredients | Hyaluronic aicd-infused clay, ectoin, SPF 50 | Shades | 14 | Finish | Natural | Size | 1.18 fl. oz. | Sun Bum Daily Glow Tinted Sunscreen Moisturizer SPF 30 Pros - Hydrating formula - Glowy, dewy finish - Fragrance-free Cons - May not be suitable for oily skin This tinted moisturizer comes in one universal shade that works on most skin tones due to its sheer finish.

mzoacms,2025-06-25 10:40:16,en,REDDIT,"  Do not fall for any marketing gimmicks, nothing's gonna stop your skin from aging in this era. We've messed up the Ozone so bad that all the sun aging that happens over 50 years is exponentially faster now. So there will come a time where all these products will stop working and you will look old, simply because you will be old. All you can do is make sure you age less drastically. For that, brands and specific products don't really matter. Its all about sun protection and hydration. Get a high spf sunscreen (50+ at least), the Supergoop stick is good. Drop it into your purse so you keep reapplying throughout the day and it doesn't leave a white cast. For hydration, you need all the usual suspects- hyaluronic acid, niacinamide etc. Ideally, find a serum that has all of these so you just have one thing to apply here. There's not much of a need to drop a fortune on this though, just go searching on Amazon. [This Tonkina one](https://onlinehairguide.com/dp-B0DRP148L4) is a good place to start, it's got the usuals plus a bit of retinol and ginseng (ginseng works a little like collagen so helps your body produce more skin cells). The concentration isn't too taxing so it shouldn't sting honestly. All this hydration is basically gonna help the skin cells retain more water and stay plump and turgid so your skin looks tighter from the outside. Go over it with the lightest layer of aquaphor possible, especially in the summer, so you lock in all that hydration too. And please, for the love of God, don't forget to apply all of these to your neck too. It's as delicate as your face and gets the same amount of sun exposure. Keep expectations reasonable and start looking at labels more closely, hope this helped!"

From gels and creams to sprays and roll-on sticks, I've put plenty through their paces, but very few have impressed me like . Not only do they provide high levels of UV protection, they tend to have the most sophisticated and fast-absorbing textures that don't leave skin feeling sticky or greasy. Better yet, there's many reasonably priced options to shop, too. My favourite is the . It's the first Korean SPF I tried over a year ago, and I've not stopped using it since. I have a combination skin type, with oiliness on my forehead, nose and chin, but dryness on my cheeks. Therefore I want a sun cream that hydrates and balances my complexion, and also doesn't disrupt my make-up on top, nor is too much faff to re-apply when I'm on holiday. For me, the ticks every box. Here's why I love it. Product reviewed: ⏰ Tested for: One year ⭐ Rating: 5/5 Reasons to buy: It's fast-absorbing and has a beautifully radiant finish and leaves my complexion feeling silky smooth ✋ Reasons to avoid: Very oily skin types may prefer a more mattifying finish Best deal we've found: Amazon 90100Expert Score Sun protection factor: 50 Key ingredients: Rice and grain fermented extracts This creamy SPF is hydrating and particularly good for dry skin. Pros Super lightweight Feels moisturising and smoothing Fast-absorbing and easy to layer when reapplying Cons Might be a too glowy finish for very oily skin types £12.38 (Was £16.91) at Amazon Reasons to buy This was the that I tried and immediately fell in love with. It has a creamy texture that's rich enough to, without leaving me so glowy it looks borderline greasy. Within seconds it's fully absorbed, with no laborious massaging needed and none of the dreaded white cast left behind. It's never irritated my sensitive skin which is prone to redness, no matter how much I use and simply leaves me looking luminous. My favourite aspect is how seamlessly it can be reapplied throughout the day without leaving layers of stickiness on my skin. It also has a beautifully radiant finish and leaves my complexion feeling silky smooth. While its retail price may seem like a big cost upfront, it's much better than luxurious competitors such as Shiseido and Supergoop! which charge upwards of £35 for their formulas. Plus, it's currently on sale at and , making now the perfect time to snap it up. ✋ Reasons to avoid I'm a huge fan and have recommended this sun cream to multiple friends and family members. However if you have very oily skin, you may prefer an SPF with a mattifying finish for more effective oil control throughout the day. If that's you, my favourite matte suncare option is the . I've been using this pick for over half a decade and love its fluid and lightweight texture as it isn't sticky and doesn't lead to breakouts, controls shine throughout the day and sits nicely under make-up. Best deal we've found While the typically retails for between £15.50 and £17 – pretty reasonable compared to pricier SPFs from luxury brands – you can currently shop it at for just £12.38.

SELF's lifestyle writer, Jenna Ryu, says it's perfect for days when you don't want to wear a heavy face of makeup: “A little truly goes a long way, especially since it has very good coverage for hyperpigmentation and discoloration.” SELF's commerce director, Shanna Shipin, agrees. “It wears almost like a foundation, with a decent amount of coverage and a far more elegant feel than your typical sunscreen,” she says. “It gives me a nice dewy glow when I first apply it, but it does dry down to a more natural finish.” It's also easy to find your color match, according to Ryu. “As someone with yellowish AND pinkish undertones, oftentimes, tinted sunscreens look orange on me when they oxidize,” she says. “But not this one!” Pros & ConsAccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron ProsConsFeels lightweight on skinCan settle into fine lines, according to our testerProvides great coverageA little goes a long wayComes in more shades than most other tinted sunscreensFragrance-free Product specsAccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron SPF type: Mineral | Size: 1.7 fl oz | Shades: 15 | Other notable ingredients: Hydrating glycerin, protective antioxidant vitamin E Best for Light Coverage: Saie Slip Tint SPF 35 Saie Slip Tint SPF 35 $38 Saie $38 Sephora Just looking for a sheer wash of color? Saie's Slip Tint acts as a moisturizing base that helps even out your skin tone while giving your blush and bronzer something to stick to. “It has a blurring effect and I feel like I don't need foundation—just a little bit of concealer here and there and I'm good to go,” one SELF tester says. “It feels hydrating, but doesn't make my skin look too greasy or shiny.” Pros & ConsAccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron ProsConsHas a blurring effectSome Sephora reviewers say it feels oily, so we recommend it for people with dry to normal skinSynthetic fragrance- and cruelty-freeFeels hydrating Product specsAccordionItemContainerButton LargeChevron SPF type: Mineral | Size: 1.35 fl oz | Shades: 14 | Other notable ingredients: Moisturizing grapeseed and argan oils, vitamin E, hydrating hyaluronic acid, soothing bisabolol, anti-inflammatory licorice root extract, aloe vera Best for Medium Coverage: Ciele Tint & Protect SPF 50+ Ciele Tint & Protect SPF 50+ $44 Sephora Ciele's Healthy Beauty Award—winning Tint & Protect expertly smooths over dry skin to deliver a dewy, medium-coverage finish. “Even for a perennially dry person with frequent eczema flaking, Ciele's formula gives me glorious coverage, with a natural glow that makes me look and feel like I actually get enough water and sleep each day,” Shipin says. She uses Ciele's dual-ended makeup brush to blend the product out, which helps build coverage. “So it's not as travel-friendly or handy on-the-go as some other formulas, but for my daily foundation with SPF protection?

mzrzvz3,2025-06-25 22:03:09,en,REDDIT,"  Here's what I use and it's worked for me! A cera ve cleanser (I used to use the hydrating one that foams) and the Cetaphil gentle cleanser to just get back the hydration because cerave is kind of stripping. After I shower I very gently pat my face dry and use the Thayer's milky toner with snow mushroom, it's sticky and really hydrating. I use lotion before sunscreen (cerave, neutrogena and aveeno work best since they aren't oil based like Cetaphil). tinted sunscreen is best, I used to use cerave but my medication made my skin super sensitive, so I use a Eucerin sunscreen. All of the products are available on amazon, superdrug or iHerb. (Side note: If you are brown neutrogena's sunscreen works the best, or supergoop since they don't leave a white cast)"

A pair of popular quick-dry water shoes to keep your feet from burning or getting beaten up all summer — reviewers love these for everything from walking on rockier beaches to kayaking to washing their cars. They're flexible and comfy like a sock, but protective against nefarious objects like sharp rocks and stray Legos. Promising review: ""I bought these shoes a couple of years ago before a river hike. UM THESE ARE AWESOME. These shoes feel like socks but with enough of a sole that you can walk on gravel with no problem. It really is like walking barefoot. Also, these are the only water shoes that I have worn that do NOT let a bunch of debris into the shoe, making you constantly have to take it off to empty it or just deal with the irritant. You can play on the beach with minimal sand stuck between your toes. Thoroughly impressed by that. So with that, I do recommend if you are a half size to size down so they are snug, otherwise the sock-like ability to keep stuff out might not work so well."" —Samantha Lindsay Get it from Amazon for $8.99+ (available in seven sizes and 44 colors). 2. A two-in-one nausea relief inhaler designed to work FAST on spontaneous nausea, motion sickness, morning sickness, and general queasiness (having a human body is hard). Summer road trips and cruises just got a HECK of a lot more bearable. You can either use it as a scent inhaler or rub it directly on the tip of your nose for relief! Promising review: ""Took this on my first cruise. Anytime that I started to feel woozy I'd reach for it. I'm sure the required act of deep breathing helped a lot - and breathing in the fragrance of the essential oil is very calming and effective. Worked for me! Wonderful!"" —Willy&Lilly Get a pack of two from Amazon for $12.99 (also available in a pack of four). 3. A set of delightfully wacky, DEET-free mosquito-repelling bracelets for the ultimate in genius summer investments — these use essential oils, including citronella, to help stop those teensy vampires in their tracks. Cliganic is a small business that specializes in all-natural personal care products. Check out a TikTok of the mosquito-repelling bracelets in action. Promising review: ""I moved last year from Southern California to North Carolina. Bugs of all types have always been attracted to me but the amount of bites I got last summer was WILD. Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and un-touched. Delivery was very quick so that was a plus. I'm not fond of the smell, I'm hyper sensitive to smells, but I'd rather have the odor than being chewed alive."" —Tracey Agopian Get a ten-pack from Amazon for $9.99. 4. And if it's too late for that, a set of kid-friendly hydrocolloid mosquito itch relief patches you can wear at the beach, pool, bath, or shower without worrying about them sliding off. Reviewers swear by these not just for helping prevent itching, but to reduce the redness and swelling faster. Quitch is a small business that specializes in family-friendly bug repellent and bug bite relief products. Promising review: ""I don't know how this works but it helped my itching SO MUCH! It sticks quite well and even stays on after a shower. I got them because I was traveling to an area that had lots of mosquitos. I would be itching so bad, but once I placed one on the bite, it reduced the itching to almost nonexistent. The pack comes with different sizes. It's helped with not scarring my legs from the bites. I'll definitely rebuy this for summer. It's so easy and great to just throw in your bag.""..."

La estrella de Euphoria es conocida por su rostro impecable, y aunque su piel luzca de pasarela, su rutina de cuidado es mucho más sencilla (y realista) de lo que podrías pensar. En entrevistas recientes, la actriz ha compartido los pasos esenciales con los que cuida su cutis, revelando que menos es más... cuando se trata de constancia y buenos productos. Que sí, que “con solo 25 años raro es que no tenga la piel bien” pensarás, pero lo cierto es que en estas edades es crucial el skincare, pues el exceso de sebo puede crear espinillas y granitos nuevos poco estéticos con los que un maquillaje de alfombra roja puede irse al traste. Artículo relacionado La rutina de cuidado facial de Zendaya: limpieza ante todo Por este motivo y debido a todos los maquillajes pesados que le ponen en el rostro durante sus múltiples rodajes… Zendaya no consiente irse a dormir sin limpiarse la piel. El cansancio no justifica algo que para ella no es una opción. Su rutina nocturna siempre comienza con la eliminación del maquillaje, incluso después de los días más agotadores. 1. Utiliza un limpiador suave para eliminar las impurezas: ella emplea el SheaMoisture African Black Soap Cleansing Bar, un jabón sólido con ingredientes naturales, apto para pieles sensibles y con tendencia a brotes de acné. SheaMoisture African Black Soap Cleansing Bar/ IHERB 2. Después de la limpieza, aplica una crema hidratante de noche, que ayuda a suavizar y equilibrar la textura de la piel mientras duerme. ¿Su apuesta segura? La Tatcha Water Cream, una crema algo cara, pero eficaz cuya textura ligera, basada en agua, hidrata sin dejar sensación grasa (ideal para evitar levantarse con imperfecciones). Tatcha Water Cream/ AMAZON 3. Y como toque final, un contorno de ojos que combate las ojeras y la hinchazón, dejando la mirada fresca para el día siguiente. Su preferido es el Clarins Total Eye Lift Firming Eye Cream. Clarins Total Eye Lift Firming Eye Cream/ DRUNI Su secreto antes del maquillaje: piel bien preparada Antes de comenzar con cualquier look de maquillaje, Zendaya tiene un truco que no falla: preparar su piel con un suero revitalizante. Uno de sus favoritos es el Advanced Génifique Microbiome, un producto que no solo mejora la apariencia de la piel, sino que trabaja desde dentro para mantenerla saludable. Este paso no solo aporta luminosidad, sino que también hace que el maquillaje se funda mejor con la piel. Advanced Génifique Microbiome/ DOUGLAS El secreto de belleza de Zendaya para una piel de película Aunque Zendaya no se considera una fanática de las rutinas largas, sí confiesa que le gusta probar distintos productos y que no siempre usa lo mismo. Cree que alternar el cuidado de la piel ayuda a que los productos funcionen mejor. “Siento que los cosméticos vuelven a tener efecto cuando los dejo un tiempo y los retomo más adelante”, ha comentado en entrevistas. Uno de los últimos productos que ha confesado haber empezado a probar es el protector solar viral Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen SPF+30, completamente atraída por las opiniones de TikTok. Supergoop Unseen Sunscreen SPF+3/ SEPHORA Lo que sí es inamovible en su rutina es la hidratación previa al maquillaje. “Si no me hidrato, mi piel se cuartea. La piel es el órgano más grande del cuerpo. Si la cuidas, todo lo demás va bien”, asegura. Artículo relacionado Cejas cuidadas y cabello natural: los esenciales de su look diario Zendaya también le da mucha importancia a sus cejas, a las que considera claves en cualquier look. “Cambiar su forma o volumen, transforma toda tu expresión”, ha dicho. Prefiere dejarlas crecer y moldearlas con geles o lápices para definirlas según el estilo del día. En cuanto a su cabello, ha aprendido a abrazar su textura natural. Después de dejar atrás los peinados con calor, se ha reconciliado con sus rizos. “Me gusta que mi melena se vea como es, y estoy aprendiendo qué necesita para estar sana”, afirma. Para ella, el cabello rizado no debe asociarse al desorden, sino a belleza auténtica y bien cuidada. Estilo camaleónico para la alfombra roja Cuando se trata de eventos y apariciones públicas, Zendaya se transforma. De la mano de su estilista de confianza, Law Roach, le gusta crear personajes con cada look. “Para la Gala Met, por ejemplo, nos inspiramos en Juana de Arco y exageramos el rubor para darle un aire pictórico”, recuerda. Sin embargo, no teme ajustar su look en el último minuto si algo no encaja del todo...."

博瓦尔德（Bovaird）上周推出了与H&M的《白莲花度假村》合作系列。 这个系列充满丰富的质感、图案和色彩。 这款钩针上衣就在该系列之中，它会让人想起我们在屏幕上看到的，由艾米·卢·伍德（Aimee Lou Wood）饰演的切尔西（Chelsea）所穿的第一套服装。 博瓦尔德的灵感来自'60年代和70年代的度假着装'。 在合作系列中的'复古夏威夷和古巴衬衫'、'钩针和网眼上衣'、褶边连衣裙和超大廓形中都能看到这种灵感的体现。 她说这些单品反映了各种各样的元素，还带有一种'波西米亚浪漫'的氛围。 幻影牌亚麻夏季阔腿裤

考虑到该剧的拍摄地，博瓦尔德从泰国的颜色（葱郁的绿色、热带番石榴色、土陶色、橙色和皇家紫色）中汲取服装灵感。 这些阔腿裤与第三季中随处可见的“飘逸宽松亚麻布”相呼应。 这种抽绳裤由人造丝和亚麻混纺而成，透气性好，有着轻松的海滩风格版型。 Lulus充满海滩感觉的挂脖O型环连体泳衣

据博瓦尔德所说，《白莲花度假村》时尚的另一个元素是'吸睛泳衣'。 她着眼于黄色等鲜艳色彩和波尔卡圆点等图案。 度假风的精髓在于'按照自己的感觉着装'，这是一种'无规则'的理念，也是度假模式下的理想准则。 这件霓虹绿的泳衣是所有这些元素的缩影，它在躯干部分有一个俏皮的挖空设计，高腰剪裁可以露出一些肌肤。 尼龙/氨纶混纺面料有很好的弹性，也很容易抖落沙子和其他海滩残留物。 八月天空花卉长袖中长连衣裙

Someone gave me one of these types of bracelets to use one day and it seemed to work SOOOOOO I decided to buy myself an arsenal to prepare for this summer. I read the reviews and about 99% of them had great results. I've only used this bracelet twice but both times I was outside and un-touched. Delivery was very quick so that was a plus.

mov_5703B752798FB1105AC62873B1117EC7,2025-07-02 12:00:00,en,WEB,"  Ask any dermatologist: Sunscreen isn't just for beach days and backyard barbecues. Summer or winter, rain or shine, it's a must, they say. And yet, SPF is often too greasy to use every day, not to mention it can be shiny on skin, unruly under makeup, and stain clothes. What are the sunscreens doctors themselves use, we wondered, with clean-feeling formulations light enough for everyday wear? We reached out to skincare experts, specifically dermatologists and plastic surgeons for their recommendations, and their picks are simple to use, easy to find, and seriously effective. The best sunscreen is the one you'll actually wear, so here are nine doctor-recommended sunscreens you can blend easily into your daily routine. Best Dermatologist-Recommended Sunscreens Skinceuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF 50 Credit: Skinceuticals The most effective sunscreen for you is one you'll reach for time and again. For Dr. Don Yoo, a board-certified facial plastic surgeon in Beverly Hills, Calif., it's the Skinceuticals Physical Fusion UV Defense SPF 50. “For daily use, what I look for in a sunscreen is broad-spectrum protection in a non-comedogenic mineral base. Since I tend to have sensitive skin, I prefer sunscreens with a mineral base, but with a finish that feels clean on the skin with no white cast or heaviness.” He loves this Skinceuticals pick as it's “100 percent mineral” but blends in “smoothly without leaving a residue,” he said. La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-in Milk Sunscreen SPF 60 Credit: Amazon The sunscreen format you choose each day may vary with the activities your day holds. While his preference for daily-wear sunscreen is mineral, Dr. Yoo—an avid golfer—prefers a chemical sunscreen when he hits the links. “My current go-to is La Roche-Posay Anthelios Melt-in Milk Sunscreen SPF 60, as it provides long-lasting broad-spectrum coverage with 80 minutes of water resistance in a light, non-greasy finish that leaves no white cast and does not sting even when it gets into my eyes.” Eucerin Sun Sensitive Mineral Sunscreen Lotion SPF 50 Credit: Amazon Though mineral sunscreens are the gold standard, the zinc oxide and titanium dioxide they contain can leave behind a chalky, white residue, especially on melanated skin. For mineral-based coverage that's also sheer, Dr. Ha Linh Vu, a board-certified dermatologist with Dermatology Partners in Philadelphia, Pa., swears by the affordable drugstore brand Eucerin. “My personal favorite daily SPF is the Eucerin Sun Sensitive Mineral Sunscreen,” Dr. Vu said. “I like that it is not too liquidy, so it does not run too much when you apply it. It also rubs in nicely without leaving a white cast, working well even on darker skin tones.” TiZO2 Non-Tinted Facial Mineral Sunscreen and Primer SPF 40 Credit: Amazon Another favorite of Dr. Vu's is TiZO2 Non-Tinted Facial Mineral Sunscreen and Primer. “I like this for all of the same reasons as the Eucerin sunscreen. In addition, it has a nice matte finish, so [it's] great for hotter days and for use as a primer,” she said. “The smaller size also makes it perfect for travel use. It comes in a tinted version that is great if you want protection from visible light, or to use it as a light foundation.” Isdin Eryfotona Actinica Zinc Oxide Broad Spectrum SPF 50+ Credit: Amazon Dr. Maya Thosani, a board-certified dermatologist with Modern Dermatology in Scottsdale, Ariz., is a noted fan of dual-action sunscreens, which not only protect from UVA and UVB rays, but also pamper skin with nourishing goodies to help reverse existing UV damage. For head-to-toe protection each day, she trusts Isdin's Eryfotona Actinica Zinc Oxide Broad Spectrum SPF 50+. “I absolutely love this for how lightweight it goes on being a purely mineral sunscreen,” Dr. Thosani said. “This is a double-action sunscreen, is cosmetically elegant, and appreciated by women in its tinted version—and they have an untinted one that men love.” Making it an even better value, Dr. Thosani points out, the bottle design allows for all the product to be used, down to the very last UV-filtering drop. Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen SPF 40 Credit: Amazon Thicker formulas can clog pores more easily, according to Dr. Anna Chacon, a board-certified dermatologist based in Miami, Fla., who recommends lightweight sunscreens if you have acne-prone skin...."

The Bangas, among Nykaa's earliest investors, are offloading about 60 million shares at an offer price of ₹200 per share, a 5.5% discount to the latest closing price, the term sheet showed. Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan are managing the transaction. Banga, Nykaa, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs did not immediately respond to Mint's requests for comment. Banga, a commodities billionaire and chairman of Hong Kong-based Caravel Group, held an 8.7% stake in Nykaa before it listed in 2021. The Nayar family, who founded the company, still owns 52% and has not sold any shares since the IPO. This latest sale comes nearly a year after Banga divested over four crore shares—amounting to a 1.43% stake—at ₹208.30 apiece in August 2024, netting ₹851.5 crore. Following that transaction, his holding fell from 6.40% to 4.97%. For the quarter ended 31 March, Nykaa reported a near three-fold jump in consolidated net profit to ₹20.28 crore from ₹6.93 crore a year earlier. Revenue from operations rose 23.61% to ₹2,061.76 crore from ₹1,667.98 crore in FY24. Over the past year, the company has launched a record number of global beauty brands, forging partnerships with Yves Saint Laurent, NARS, Kerastase, Eucerin, GHD, Armani Beauty, Supergoop, and Nexxus, among others. Nykaa is now shifting toward a more profitable growth trajectory, aiming for mid-20% annual growth in its beauty and personal care (BPC) business over the next five years. The strategy includes deeper market penetration, premiumization, and enhanced convenience. The company plans to scale its physical footprint across tier 2 and 3 cities, increasing store count from 237 to over 500 by FY30. It is also investing heavily in regional influencer marketing, working with over 28,000 influencers to drive discovery. To improve delivery speeds, Nykaa is ramping up its logistics infrastructure. Its two-hour fulfilment model, 'Nykaa Now', is live in seven metros. This is supported by a network of 44 warehouses and 40+ rapid hubs, enabling same- or next-day delivery in key cities."

mov_EC120B8032FF048583515FCE9A78EB99,2025-07-02 22:31:05,en,WEB,"  The brush Cierra from Love Island USA uses to perfect her curls is in here! 1. A box of *limited edition* fabric Band-Aids that'll feel like a major upgrade from the boring, plastic-y ""flesh"" toned ones that never actually match and don't stay put. These are way more flexible, come in gorgeous summery patterns, and will actually stay on longer than it takes you to pick up coffee at Dunkin'. Promising review: ""These are SO cute and stay on for a long time! I've never really been a fan of plastic bandages, so these are my go-to when I'm looking for cloth Band-Aids."" —Jess Get a box of 30 from Amazon for $7.20. 2. A duo of Aquaphor Lip Repair tubes because I'm sure I'm not the only one suffering from extremely chapped lips. It's fragrance-and-paraben-free and filled with soothing shea butter and chamomile essence that'll help heal your lips in time for your next date night. Promising review: ""One of the best lip balms I've ever used. I love to sleep with it and wake up with my lips completely renewed. Highly recommended."" —Cintia Gomes Get a pack of two from Amazon for $8.36. 3. A low-profile under-the-cabinet banana hanger you'll, for lack of a better term, go *bananas* over when you see 1. how easy it is to install (it literally just sticks on with a strong adhesive) and 2. how much room you suddenly have on your counter without your go-to breakfast taking up residence. Check out a TikTok of the banana hanger in action. Promising review: ""I recently purchased this folding banana hook hanger, and it has been a great addition to my kitchen! The design is clever and space-saving, allowing me to easily fold it away when not in use. It keeps my bananas fresh and prevents them from bruising, which is a big plus. The hanger is sturdy and well-made, ensuring it can hold a bunch of bananas without any issues. Highly recommend for anyone looking to organize their kitchen and keep their fruit in great condition!"" —Challas Gordman Get it from Amazon for $6.79 (available in five colors and in packs of two). 4. A Dreo oscillating tower fan with six (!!!) speeds you can aim directly at yourself to ensure your always-too-hot body is kept at the epitome of comfort at all times. Since it's bladeless, it won't make a racket while you're trying to get some shut-eye or watch Real Housewives. BuzzFeed editor Jenae Sitzes swears by this fan, she said, ""I have this exact tower fan, and as someone who doesn't have an AC in her bedroom (because it's a fire escape window), LET ME TELL YOU: It comes in clutch. And not only in the summer, but year-round — in the winter, this thing keeps us from burning up once our ~overzealous~ radiator kicks on (New Yorkers know). So yeah, our Dreo fan works pretty much 365 days a year and has been going strong since summer 2023. It has six speeds, though I only need to kick it up to full blast occasionally. It keeps me cool at night, it's quiet, and the night mode is super handy because it turns off the LED display quickly if you need to adjust the speed during the night. You can mute the little beeping sounds with the remote too if needed."" Promising review: ""This fan saved my life. I like the noise, but it's not too loud. It's perfect for the slight white noise. The power is great! I usually keep it on settings 1–3 because I like the lower blo,w but level 5 is powerful and will keep you cool. It's so cool when connected to Alexa. She can control it all, and I never have to get up! It was easy to set u,p too!"" —HayHay Get it from Amazon for $89.97+ (available in two styles and three colors). 5. A set of DEET-free mosquito-repelling bracelets that'll use the magic of essential oils (think: geranium and lemongrass) to keep those nasty little buggers away from your too-sweet skin...."
mov_FD9B2F395DE41C2F878CE90EF1C3FA00,2025-07-02 23:31:02,en,WEB,"  I'm here to inform you that you can live your best bougie life *without* going broke in the process. See proof below ⬇ 1. An exquisite tinted lip balm shockingly similar to Clinique's ""Black Honey"" but doesn't cost nearly as much. It comes in a weightless, non-sticky formula that glides onto your pout to give 'em a subtle polished tint of your choosing. Soon you'll be smackin' your lips all over the place, and no one can really blame you when they look this good. ♀ My colleague Emma Lord can vouch for this: ""I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference!"" Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get a two-pack from Amazon for $9.99 (also available in a pink honey version, individually, and as a two-pack that includes both!) . 2. A three-pack of retro-inspired polarized sunglasses that'll diversify your accessory portfolio with some vintage flair without overspending a single pair of Ray-Bans. It never hurts to have ✨options✨ and you won't find a better bang for your buck. Promising review: ""I've been buying these for years. They replaced my Ray-Bans that look identical! Fit great and with the price point I don't have to worry too much with my kids and being on the go!"" —Jessica M Get a pack of three from Amazon for $18.99+ (available in 13 sets, as well as packs of two and individual pairs). 3. E.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen if you, like me, are wondering when sunscreen became one of the most expensive skincare items ever? Enter this affordable find, which offers SPF 35 *and* goes on smooth and clear without any white cast. It works well as a blurring primer to create the perf setup before applying makeup too! TL:DR; it's the more affordable version of Supergoop! My colleague Jenae Sitzes uses it: ""The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop! 's cult-fave product end. I've tried both, and I honestly prefer this E.l.f. version. Supergoop! 's had a slight graininess to it that I didn't love, while this E.l.f. sunscreen is exactly what I'd hoped Supergoop! 's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop! 's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop! 's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop! 's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top!"" Promising review: ""This sunscreen is a gem. I was not expecting to love it as much as I do. I absolutely love E.l.f. products, but I rarely try their skincare...."

mov_408C8841FD20D09DE4E9C70A8AD0C192,2025-07-03 07:39:26,en,WEB,"  Updated 3 July 2025 at 13:09 IST The total value of the transaction is estimated to be in the range of Rs 1,200 crore, as per multiple media reports. Investment banks Goldman Sachs (India) Securities and JP Morgan India were reportedly appointed as placement agents for the deal. Shares of FSN E-Commerce Ventures Ltd, the parent company of beauty and fashion retailer Nykaa, slipped sharply on Thursday, weighed down by a large block deal involving one of its early investors. The stock fell nearly 5 percent in early trade, touching an intraday low of around Rs 201 on the NSE, amid heightened selling pressure on the bourses. As per media reports, Harindarpal Singh Banga along with Indra Banga, offloaded approximately six crore shares in the company through bulk transactions. The deal was executed at a floor price of Rs 200 per share, which is around around 5 percent below Wednesday's closing price of Rs 211.59—triggering a swift reaction from investors. The total value of the transaction is estimated to be in the range of Rs 1,200 crore, as per multiple media reports. Investment banks Goldman Sachs (India) Securities and JP Morgan India were reportedly appointed as placement agents for the deal. Harindarpal Singh Banga, the founder of the Hong Kong-based Caravel Group, held an 8.7 per cent stake in Nykaa prior to the company's stock market debut in 2021. The Nayar family, who established the brand, continues to hold a controlling stake of 52 per cent and has not divested any shares since the IPO. This recent sale follows a similar move nearly a year ago, when Banga sold four crore shares—equivalent to a 1.43 per cent stake—at a price of Rs 208.30 per share in August. That transaction reduced his ownership from 6.40% to 4.97%. Robust financial results Despite Thursday's share price drop, Nykaa has posted solid financial performance in recent quarters. The company reported a three-fold jump in net profit for the March quarter, which rose to Rs 20 crore. For the full financial year, net profit more than doubled to Rs 66 crore, underpinned by continued strength in its beauty and personal care verticals. Expansion plans on track Over the last one year, Nykaa has introduced an unprecedented number of international beauty labels to the Indian market through new partnerships with globally renowned names such as Yves Saint Laurent, NARS, Kerastase, Eucerin, GHD, Armani Beauty, Supergoop, and Nexxus, among others. As it enters its next phase of expansion, the company is focused on driving sustainable profitability. It is targeting a mid-20 percent compound annual growth rate in its beauty and personal care (BPC) segment over the next five years. In parallel, Nykaa is looking to strengthen its offline footprint by scaling up its presence in tier 2 and tier 3 cities. The retailer plans to grow its physical store network from the current 237 locations to over 500 by FY30. This site is part of Republic World and Republic Media Network"

But Let's Get Back to Prime Day  Before you start shopping, make a plan. Our philosophy when it comes to major shopping events like Black Friday, Cyber Monday, and Amazon Prime Day is to first consider what you need and make a list. If you don't have a plan, you could end up buying things you really don't need. Think about what you regularly shop for: snacks for the kids, batteries, cleaning supplies, etc. Then look around your house and see if you need bigger items like kitchen appliances or a new vacuum cleaner. Do the kids need anything? Outdoor toys, sports equipment, crafting kits, clothes, and back-to-school supplies come to mind. Maybe you have a wedding shower or birthday party that you need gifts for—this is a good time to score what they want at a savings. Load up your online shopping cart now for faster checkout on the big day. While the deals are too numerous to list, we've done some of the legwork for you and rounded up what you can expect this Prime Day, broken down by category, and what you can buy right now!

mov_650858BD98F0280FBFFC4D033651C378,2025-07-04 13:01:03,en,WEB,"  This $10 version of Glossier's beloved $78 scent will have you smelling like a fairytale. 1. A tinted lip balm that's eerily close to the same magic as ""Black Honey,"" TikTok's beloved $25 ~universal shade~ from Clinique, that it will genuinely startle you — especially when you see the price. This is a perfect, non-sticky ""go-to"" lippie that's just a step above the ""no makeup makeup"" look, giving the perfect subtly polished effect. I bought this because I crave that Black Honey and will buy it until the day I die, but I am always paranoid of losing it, so I almost never let it leave my bag. I have tried probably five or six ""almost"" versions of Black Honey that came close, but this one genuinely spooked me. It has the same easy glide, same buildability, and the same refreshingly hydrating effect. It was a two-pack so I gave one to my BFF, another Black Honey fan, who also could not detect the difference! Promising review: ""Better than Clinique! I bought this one on a whim but never liked the real Black Honey Almost Lipstick by Clinique, since it tends to run red on me. This shade, in my opinion, is exactly what Black Honey SHOULD be, as it looks more like Black Honey in pictures. For the price, it can't be beat, so I'm buying more."" —HAC Get it from Amazon for $6.99 (also available in the pink honey version, and in a two-pack that mixes both!) . 2. Gold Bond's firming neck and chest cream your skin will be SO happy to soak up — this is formulated with aloe, salicylic acid, and jojoba oil to help hydrate, tighten, and gently exfoliate your skin so effectively that you should be able to see early results in two weeks. (For some reviewers, it only took a few days!) Promising review: ""I am a lotion user every single day. I use face moisturizers that I love. I am over the moon how good this is. I mainly use it on my neck, hands and forearms. The difference is amazing. My skin actually feels so good. I wish I could but larger containers of it."" —Kimberly P. Get it from Amazon for $11.19. 3. A travel-friendly SPF 50 Airy Sunstick Smoothing Bar, a K-beauty staple with a curved balm stick style that makes it super easy to apply, and a nonsticky, white cast–free formula that plays ABSURDLY well with makeup. If you're looking for a lightweight ""soft matte"" sunscreen to protect your skin, this is your new BFF. Check out a TikTok of the Airy Sunstick Smoothing Bar in action. Note that the AAD recommends using at least SPF 30 and reapplying as needed for skin protection. You can read about sunscreen myths and facts from dermatologists for more information! Promising review: ""NO WHITE CAST! I've been looking for a stick sunscreen and this was just exactly what was needed!! I'm a medium-toned Black woman and looking for something without a white cast is always a challenge. I have applied it on my bare skin and there isn't a white cast at all! It's a 'soft matte' finish, for sure, and looks like natural skin. Like you're not wearing anything at all."" —Martina Get it from Amazon for $17.02. 4. Plus Hawaiian Tropic's SPF 30 Mineral Powder Sunscreen Brush, aka your scalp's BFF this summer — reviewers don't just swear by this for face coverage and a protective setting powder, but for protecting their hairline without their hair getting goopy from sunscreen scalp sprays or regular sunscreen lotion. Bonus — this is a heck of a lot cheaper than its competitors, like the $35 Supergoop  and $36 Brush On Block! Note that the AAD recommends using at least SPF 30 and reapplying as needed for skin protection. You can read about sunscreen myths and facts from dermatologists for more information! Promising review: ""Wish I would have found this sooner! Works great and so far the cheapest option I have found for powder sunscreen. Love that my face isn't greasy anymore from normal sunscreen!"" —Michelle..."

mov_B58F2493E0835F8513A519F3C794AE3D,2025-07-07 11:01:04,en,WEB,"  This blurring powder is basically pure witchcraft and your *best* weapon against heat and humidity. And no, it's not the $59 Givenchy version. 1. Laneige's Neo Blurring Powder, which is SO GOOD at eliminating shine and blurring pores that I feel like it'd smirk at you and go, ""How 'bout that, huh? "" if it had a human form. If you dread summer because you love wearing makeup but the heat and humidity leave it looking patchy, this'll lock it in with a smooth, semi-matte finish. Your oily T-zone doesn't know what's coming for it. One reviewer compares this to a $59 Givenchy powder! Check out a TikTok of the Laneige Neo Blurring Powder in action. Promising review: ""This is the secret for makeup in hot and humid climates! I am a sweaty person, but I also love wearing makeup regardless of the weather. While holidaying in Southeast Asia at the start of wet season, I faced temperatures between 35 and 40 degrees Celsius (95–104 degrees Fahrenheit) with high humidity. After finishing my base makeup, I applied this powder all over. I did not use a setting spray because most break me out. Luckily, no setting spray was necessary while using this setting powder! It kept my foundation and cream blush from separating or becoming patchy, and also kept me from being too shiny. I reapplied a couple of times per day. This is magical and I will definitely be using regularly during the summers in North America too!"" —Sara Lima Get it from Amazon for $25. 2. A smocked midi dress because Hill House's Nap Dress is truly ~dreamy~ but your bank account is like, ""Um, we still need to buy groceries."" This cutie's a fraction of the cost and just as gorgeous, not to mention breathable as heck thanks to its 100% organic cotton poplin fabric. Prepare to fall head over heels for this dress — I definitely did. I recently wore this dress (in shade Lipstick Pink) to an outdoor wedding and I. AM. OBSESSED. It hugs my frame beautifully with the stretchy smocked waist — I can even get away with not wearing a bra, though for context I'm a B cup — and the flowy bottom of the dress sits just right. I personally haven't tried Hill House's Nap Dress (I drool over the designs, but $178 is a little too steep for me), but I'm perfectly happy to stock up on this dress in a few colors for around the same price. My colleague Heather Braga, on the other hand, is a Hill House devotee — but even she was impressed by this cheaper option: ""Listen, I am the proud owner of NINE Hill House Nap Dresses. I condone splurging on them (truly, by all means) and will be the first to tell you they are worth every penny. That being said, I tried out one of these from Quince and LOVE it. I have the Tribeca Stripe pattern and cannot believe how similar it feels to the other brand. It's my current go-to style for my frame (two kids in two years, send prayers) and is one of the few things I know I can throw on and KNOW I look great. Will definitely add another to an upcoming order and have been shouting from the rooftops how wonderful this brand fits."" Get it from Quince for $69.90 (available in sizes XS–XL and nine styles). 3. E.l.f. Suntouchable Invisible Sunscreen if you're still trying to find a daily sunscreen you don't despise. This clear gel sunscreen offers SPF 35 and goes on so smooth and lightweight, you'll immediately forget you're wearing it — no white cast here, folks. It doubles as a blurring primer, so it's great for wearing under makeup too! If you love Supergoop but the price is becoming hard to swallow...may I suggest trying this, because it's *very* similar. The packaging similarities are impossible to ignore, but that's not where the comparisons between this E.l.f. sunscreen and Supergoop's cult-fave product end. I've tried both, and I honestly prefer this E.l.f. version. Supergoop's had a slight graininess to it that I didn't love, while this E.l.f. sunscreen is exactly what I'd hoped Supergoop's would feel like: totally smooth and velvety. Like Supergoop's, it goes on totally clear and doesn't feel like you're wearing a mask; it sinks in immediately. And of course, a major selling point: A 1.7-ounce bottle of E.l.f. Suntouchable will cost you $14, while Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen in the same size will put you back $38. Now, it's worth noting that Supergoop's Unseen Sunscreen has SPF 50, while E.l.f.'s product offers SPF 35. Both of these meet the American Academy of Dermatology's recommendation of using a sunscreen with SPF 30 or more, which blocks 97% of the sun's UVB rays. Anything over SPF 30 offers only slightly more protection (and nothing can block 100% of the sun's rays), yet the higher number, the more brands tend to charge. So do with that info what you will! This isn't the only SPF I use, but I love having it in my arsenal, especially when I do want to layer makeup on top!..."

17881980063223155,2025-07-07 16:01:27,en,INSTAGRAM,"  June marketing wrap up! Brands are pushing the boundaries with campaigns that keep us glued to the screen and the inspiration just keeps coming! Marketers – these are the ones to watch! F1 as a Fashion Movement: f1 has been gaining major lifestyle and fashion momentum globally. Lately F1 drivers were spotted in fashion week front rows, and brands like Puma and Ferrari released apparel collections. The crossover into fashion is a real cultural shift. SPF Aesthetic Campaigns: Brands like supergoop , Skin Proud, and garnier launched influencer-led and user-generated content campaigns focused on SPF, shifting the narrative from “safety” to “aesthetic skincare.” June, being summer in the northern hemisphere, is prime SPF marketing time. Malibu Rum's Lo-Fi Campaign: malibu_rum has consistently built summer campaigns around music and dreamy visuals. In 2025, they collaborated with indie artists to seed “sounds of summer” content on TikTok and Instagram, tying their drink to a laid-back, beachy lifestyle vibe. Amazon ASMR Unboxing Content: While not a major headline-grabbing campaign, amazon and related creators have leaned into ASMR-style unboxing content, especially in Prime-related campaigns and influencer partnerships. The sensory elevation of mundane moments is a real content trend in 2025 overall. This month proved that emotion, mood, and cultural relevance are the new creative benchmarks. Create experiences people want to feel part of."

Glow SuperGoop Sunscreen- 40spf with a glowy tint— it's all you need. 3. Coconut Skin— I picked this up when we were in Franklin, TN at their Anthropologie . It is such a light, refreshing barely-there  scent. 4. Organic castor oil – use for anything that needs to be moisturized or hydrated. Face, neck, chest. Use on your eyebrows for thickness.

mov_3D37899CF39CC8962B176D885888A397,2025-07-08 04:30:00,en,WEB,"  This year, Amazon Prime Day becomes Amazon Prime Days—you can score deals for four days (instead of two) to be exact, from now to July 11. It's the longest sale the mega-retailer has ever done, and the discounts are, as always, a doozy. For the last few weeks, I have been combing through thousands of beauty deals, and have come out the other side with the 59 best skin care, makeup, body care, and hair care must-haves you should shop before the sale ends. The lowest prices begin with a $4 body exfoliating brush that I consider necessary for smooth summer skin, and on the most expensive side, Shark's rarely-on-sale hair styler (which I've never seen this cheap before). You'll also find under-the-radar picks (Dearcloud's serum blush), top-rated products (L'Oreal's Lumi Glotion skin enhancer), celebrity-used favorites (Laura Geller's baked foundation), my go-tos (Medicube's exosome serum), and much more. Best Deals Overall It was hard enough to pare this list down to 59 products, and even more difficult to single out the nine best, but here they are. There are things like Laneige's lip mask and Cosrx's snail mucin serum that you should always stock up on during sales, plus celebrity favorites like NuFace's microcurrent device, Naturium's body butter, and Supergoop's tinted primer. Naturium Skin-Renewing Retinol Body Lotion Amazon Naturium's body care is next-level, which has made fans of Hailey Bieber, Demi Moore and me. I'm going to pass on my usual order to try out this retinol body lotion. Besides the titular ingredient, there's allatonin and shea butter; it's an anti-aging, anti-inflammatory, cell-renewing, radiance-enhancing, moisturizing (whew) combination. Best Anti-Aging Skin Care Deals I know that everyone has different skin care concerns, but to paint with a broad brush, it's safe to say a lot of people are concerned with reducing and/or preventing signs of aging. As such, I have meticulously picked the 10 best on-sale anti-aging products for everything wrinkle, fine lines, and firmness-related. On the cheapest end of the spectrum, there's a $12 Medicube serum, and the most expensive—yet still incredibly affordable—is a $35 Eight Saints Eye Cream. L'Oreal Paris Revitalift Triple Power Anti-Aging Face Moisturizer, $21 (Originally $30) Womaness Let's Neck Firming Serum, $26 (Originally $35) CeraVe Skin Renewing Anti-Aging Retinol Serum, $23 (Originally $25) Nakery Lift-Tox Night Repair and Firm Cream, $20 (Originally $35) Body Firm Crepe Erase Ultra-Reparative Hand Cream, $20 (Originally $26) Gold Bond Age Renew Retinol Overnight Body and Face Lotion, $14 (Originally $17) Medicube Salmon DNA PDRN Pink Peptide Serum, $15 (Originally $22) Medicube One Day Exosome Shot 2,000 Serum, $12 (Originally $39) Eight Saints Wonder-fill Plumping Eye Cream, $35 (Originally $44) CeraVe Skin Renewing Anti-Aging Retinol Serum Amazon If you have a singular anti-aging skin care product in your routine, it should be formulated with retinol. CeraVe's Skin Renewing Anti-Aging Retinol Serum is a great choice because when it comes time for a restock, at $23, it's still a steal. The titular retinol is a wrinkle-reducing, dark spot-fading, and skin-firming powerhouse. It's complemented by a trio of plumping ceramides and ultra-hydrating hyaluronic acid. One shopper said that their “forehead had deep lines” that were visible even when they weren't  “creasing [their] brow.” After a month of using this they noted they “can't see them” anymore. Medicube Salmon DNA PDRN Pink Peptide Serum Amazon This feels like a line from Saturday Night Live, but it's true: salmon sperm skin care is everywhere. This Medicube serum uses bits of DNA derived from the stuff and for more than just shock value. It improves firmness, texture, and hydration, and fast. This formula also includes niacinamide and vitamin C-rich holy basil, a duo that has wrinkle-filling and skin-brightening properties. A shopper in their late 60s “loves the way this has made [their] face look” by making wrinkles look “less noticeable.” Best Hair Growth Deals If you want perpetually long, thick, and healthy hair, it means (unless you are genetically gifted) that you must always be searching for and buying hair growth products. To ease the financial strain this may cause, I recommend stocking up during mega-sales like Prime Day. You can go with an obvious choice like the fervently loved Mielle Organics' oil, try a celebrity go-to treatment, or upgrade your shampoo and conditioner routine. Virtue Healing Hair Oil Amazon There is a high probability that this is the most popular hair care product in Hollywood. Off the top of my head, I can tell you its celebrity fans include Nicole Kidman, Jennifer Garner, and Anne Hathaway. This oil helps promote hair growth through a variety of healing (hence its name) ingredients, the most important of which is the brand's proprietary Alpha Keratin 60ku; think of it as a honing system that targets the strands and areas that need it the most...."

Featured pricing is subject to change. Nordstrom understands the beauty of a great deal. During the department store's much-awaited Anniversary Sale, hundreds of beauty sets are up for grabs — including exclusives from hardly-ever-on-sale luxury brands like La Mer, Augustinus Bader and Dr. Dennis Gross. Page Six's Picks While deals are already available for Nordstrom Icon cardholders, they open to the brand's Ambassador tier on July 9, followed by Influencers and the general public on July 10 and 12, respectively. Below, start shopping (or curating your wishlist) with our roundup of the best celebrity-approved beauty buys — but act fast, as the most popular products tend to sell out long before the sale ends on August 4. Nordstrom La Mer's products are famously pricey, but stars like Jennifer Lopez, Kate Hudson and Selena Gomez swear they're worth it. Right now, Nordstrom's offering a rare opportunity to bag the luxury line's signature Créme de La Mer for less, along with several other mini must-haves. Nordstrom Want to smell like a star? Sofia Richie and Meghan Markle have both cited this mineral, woody Jo Malone London blend as a signature scent. Nordstrom This bestselling formula does triple duty as makeup remover, cleanser and moisturizer. Equally multitasking stars like Bethenny Frankel rave about the stuff, now available in a jumbo value version exclusively at Nordstrom. “I am partial to the original one because it makes me feel like I'm in a botanical spa,” Frankel said on TikTok, naming it one of the “expensive” items she deems “worth it.” Nordstrom Emily Ratajkowski called these pre-packaged peels “the best for exfoliating your skin” in a recent W interview, admitting she'd skipped the skincare step before. “I've noticed a huge improvement in the texture and tonal quality of my skin,” she raved. Nordstrom If splurging doesn't scare you, there's also an unheard-of deal on a set featuring the brand's SpectraLite FaceWare Pro mask. (It's like getting peel pads, blurring cream and a lip treatment for free.) “I would die for it,” DeSorbo raved of the red- and blue light-powered mask in an Amazon Live. “I truly think it is one of the only LED masks I've ever used that actually works.” Pro tip: Sets like this have been among the first to sell out in previous years, so we'd recommend snapping this one up fast. Nordstrom From famous faces to Page Six staffers, plenty of beauty experts swear by NuFace. Tay Lautner told us the “super user-friendly” device is one of her “favorite things to use to help lift, plump and smooth [her] skin before an event,” while Kate Hudson raved about the brand to Mindbodygreen. “When I do the NuFace every day, I feel a huge difference in my skin,” she told the outlet. I was not expecting that because I always think those things feel gimmicky, but they really work.” Our very own managing editor, Alexandra D'Aluisio, is also a fan: “Nicola Coughlan used the NuFace Trinity+ in a Vogue “Beauty Secrets” video … she even insisted she knew when she 'went ham' on the product because her 'cheekbones were cheekboning' in certain scenes,” she says. “That was enough to convince me to buy, and I've been trying to use it at least three times a week ever since.” Nordstrom Sabrina Carpenter can do a lot with 15 minutes — but applying her signature blush will only take you a matter of seconds. The star's long worked with makeup artist Carolina Gonzalez, who told us she applies the blendable formula on the mid-apples of the pop phenom's cheeks. “When you start on the cheekbone and go up from there, it gives you more of a lifted and snatched look,” Gonzalez explained. Nordstrom Love the Longchamp Le Pliage totes stars and royals like Kate Middleton have carried? In addition to a full-size version, the sale also includes this adorable mini makeup bag. Nordstrom Plenty of superstars stock up on Supergoop! , from Brooke Shields and Jessica Chastain to Christie Brinkley. (The latter recently told us she swears by the brand's “easy formulas.”) Nordstrom The 411 on stars' favorite face masks? So many stars use 111Skin, it just might be easier to name A-listers who haven't raved about the brand. Sydney Sweeney, Lady Gaga, Bella Hadid, Jenna Lyons and Priyanka Chopra (to name but a few) have all been linked to the label's luxe skincare. Page Six Style & Shopping Editor Elana Fishman is also impressed with the products, saying of the rose gold mask included in this set, “I slapped on this mask the morning of a video shoot, hoping it'd help me look my best on camera — and boy, did it live up to the hype.” Nordstrom..."
mov_91795B7876F9B5E21709A90BF6E8D425,2025-07-08 07:00:00,en,WEB,"  Kaitlyn McLintock wearing Wonderskin's Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain I love shopping on Amazon. Blame it on the huge selection, speedy shipping, and simple return process, but let's just say I put my Prime account to good use—especially when it comes to beauty products. Whether it's a TikTok-viral lip stain or a cult-classic Korean essence, I've placed more orders in the last year than I'd like to admit. At the time, it was bad news for my bank account, but now, it's good news for you because I know which Amazon beauty products are actually worth ordering, and right in time for Prime Day, too. This year, Prime Day deals are happening from July 8 to 11. During the sale, Prime members can score big discounts on thousands of products, including the best of the beauty category. Excited? Me too. Keep scrolling to see my official, beauty editor–approved shopping guide. Wonderskin Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain - Adore I have to start with a product I use almost every single day—Wonderskin's Wonder Blading Peel-Off Lip Stain. It went viral on TikTok a few months ago, and once I tested it, I could see why. Apply the dark-blue liquid to the lips (don't worry—it doesn't stay that way), wait a few minutes to let it dry, and peel it off. You'll be left with the most stunning, long-lasting lip color. You can stop there, or you can apply lip gloss over the top. I prefer the latter. It's become my go-to lip combo. Bioderma Sensibio H2O Micellar Water I can't tell you how many makeup artists and skincare experts have recommended Bioderma's Sensibio H2O Micellar Water to me. The classic French pharmacy product quickly and easily dissolves makeup, cleansing the skin without leaving behind even a hint of redness or irritation. Bondi Sands Self Tanning Foam Behold! The only self-tanner I've used consistently for over five years—Bondi Sands' Self Tanning Foam in Dark. It doesn't streak. It doesn't smell. It also features a bronze guide color, allowing you to see exactly where you're placing it and where you need to blend. I wear it overnight, and by the next morning, I have natural-looking, sun-kissed limbs. COLOR WOW Dream Coat Supernatural Spray I've always wondered how celebrities like Jennifer Lopez and Kim Kardashian get such glossy hair on the red carpet. Well, as it turns out, the answer is Color Wow's Dream Coat Supernatural Spray. Read my full review to learn why it's such an underrated gem. COSRX Snail Mucin 96% Power Repairing Essence Snail mucin is the ultimate glass-skin ingredient. It's moisturizing, antioxidant-rich, and anti-inflammatory, so no wonder this iconic snail mucin essence blew up on the internet. It's the key to firm, bouncy, dewy skin. Clinique Almost Lipstick in Black Honey Clinique's Almost Lipstick in Black Honey is so good. It was *the* lipstick for '90s starlets and supermodels. Everyone from Drew Barrymore to Courteney Cox and Julia Roberts wore it in the decade of slip dresses, grunge music, and mood rings. Cut to modern day, and it's still as beloved as ever. It recently had a resurgence on TikTokafter Gen Z became aware of its sheer formula and unique and universally flattering raisin-esque color. divi Scalp Serum..."

The Saie best-seller also combines skincare with the additions of licorice root for brightening, elderberry for combating free radicals, and evening primrose for hydration. Laneige Peach Iced Tea Lip Sleeping Mask Amazon Used by Meghan Markle and Sydney Sweeney, the intensive lip mask is clinically proven to soften your lips overnight and provide eight hours of hydration with the help of ingredients such as berry fruit complex, murumuru seed, and shea butter, according to the brand. This particular flavor pulls inspiration from peach iced tea for a fruity, sweet scent. Shark FlexFusion Hair Dryer Amazon This multi-use styler dries, curls, volumizes, and smooths all without damaging levels of heat thanks to a combination of powerful air and a heat-controlled ceramic fuse. The device comes with five included head attachments, including a wet or dry hair brush, two curlers, and a frizz-fighting tool that provides high shine. Bissell TurboClean Upright Carpet Cleaner Amazon Feel like your vacuum can't tackle the most high-traffic areas of your home? Integrate this powerful carpet cleaner into your housekeeping routine. “I'm shocked at the amount of dirt it's pulled up,” one five-star reviewer wrote. “It also doesn't oversaturate the carpets. I used it five hours ago, and they're already completely dry.” Our Place Titanium Always Pan Pro Amazon This sleek, reimagined take on Our Place's popular kitchenware ups the durability ante via its stainless steel exterior and titanium interior. The new design allows the pan to withstand temperatures up to 750 degrees, and it isn't affected by intense cleaning solutions. The non-stick surface is also achieved naturally, without the use of any chemicals to coat the pan. Away Bigger Carry-On Luggage Amazon As one of our favorite carry-on luggage options on the market right now, we can testify that this bag is worth the purchase. Some of the reasons we gave it top marks include its three charging ports, its ability to roll easily indoors and outdoors, and its durable, hard exterior. It also comes with handy organizational additions, like a water-repellent shoe bag, an interior pouch compression pad, and an enclosed compartment. Skechers Slip-Ins Go Walk Flex - Relish..."

Make sure to sign up for an Amazon Prime account to get the best deals. Dawn Platinum Plus Powerwash dish spray (30% off list price) Dawn foaming dish spray works superbly and most professional cleaners will tell you that you can use it to clean more than dishes. Grab this household staple plus refills in this sale, and you probably won't buy dish soap again for the rest of 2025. A Simple Modern EVA beach tote (30% off list price) You may have coveted the Bogg Bag, a roomy and boxy tote made from rubber, so it's perfect for nearly every excursion and purpose. Simple Modern (maker of the beloved tumblers) has created a much more affordable and highly-rated version constructed that has a similar Croc-like design and easy-clean fabrication. Available in three sizes and tons of colors, the Simple Modern tote has fold-flat handles and comes with a detachable and water-resistant zipper pocket for holding smaller devices like phones and keys. Clinique Almost Lipstick tinted lip balm (30% off list price) Beauty lovers know that this perfectly hued beauty product is the end-all be-all of lip balms. It's available in Black Honey and Pink Honey shades, though Black Honey is a cult-favorite lip color that is considered universally flattering and has been popular since the early aughts. This semi-glossy balm is perfect for everyday wear and rarely goes on sale. Aquaphor itch relief ointment two-pack (30% off list price) Aquaphor's itch relief ointment for kids can be used on children ages two and up to soothe itchy patches of eczema, rashes, psoriasis and more. It's made with 1% hydrocortisone, and an absolute must as we approach the summer months, when insect bites abound and contact with poison ivy is a possibility. This is the first time this two-pack has been available for under $10 and featured during Prime Day. Away Bigger carry-on luggage (20% off list price) The Bigger carry-on is what put Away on the map. It fits an astonishing amount of clothing while still complying with carry-on regulations for most major airlines. It's a game-changer for people who never want to check a bag. Like all of Away's suitcases, it's made with durable, water-repellent and lightweight materials and 360-degree wheels that glide with ease. The adjustable trolley handle has two height settings, while the interior compression pad system and organizer makes it easy to load up on clothing. It also comes with a water-repellent laundry bag. It's available in seven colors. Scrub Daddy and Scrub Mommy 8-pack (20% off list price) Scrub Daddys and Scrub Mommys are beloved by cleaning enthusiasts, plus they come in fun colors. They stay firm in colder water for heavy-duty scrubbing and soften when exposed to warm water. You can even use them on stainless steel and cast iron, as they are scratch-free. Clean up after yourself without having to break a sweat thanks to these effective little dudes. This is the first time this pack is on sale during Prime Day and the lowest price of the year. Bag Balm moisturizer (41% off list price) This cult-favorite occlusive moisturizer is a permanent mainstay on my nightstand for how well it protects and nourishes the cracked, dry skin on my hands, face, lids and lips. New York-based dermatologist Dr. Marisa Garshick previously recommended using an occlusive product such as Bag Balm. ""For any areas of dry, cracked skin, it can help to use a thicker cream or petrolatum-containing ointment to provide an occlusive barrier to lock moisture in and protect the skin from external irritants,"" she said. This is the first time Bag Balm has been on sale during Prime Day. L'Oreal Lumi Le Glass highlighter stick (33% off list price) L'Oreal's newest highlighter stick debuted earlier this year, and it hasn't been drastically discounted until right now. Anyone who loves the cult-fave Lumi Glotion needs to try out this skin brightening product. It gives skin a glassy, shimmering look that is multi-dimensional and radiant. It is buildable and has a light texture that melts into the skin without feeling sticky or greasy. Tineco iFloor One cordless wet and dry vacuum mop (40% off list price) This wildly convenient vacuum-mop floor cleaner by Tineco has the suction power to deliver an immediate and streak-free clean with its mop head roller. It's self-propelled and cordless and offers a self-cleaning system, so it's designed to stay at peak performance and completely odor-free...."

mov_5A4DEBA3C3502A1809F4B7D2F8F2EDF7,2025-07-08 12:36:55,en,WEB,"  It's not every day that I'm willingly spend money on beauty products. That is, until Amazon Prime Day rolls around. As a beauty editor, my desk is consistently stacked high with boxes of products vying for a chance to be tried and praised, but few things beat the tubes and jars I've trusted for years. Because I'm a bit spoiled by free products, I find it hard to splash out on my favorites when I'm running low—but when they're slashed by as much as 50% during Prime Day, which runs from July 8 to 11, I'll never hesitate to hit purchase. To access these steep discounts while they last, you'll need to sign up for an Amazon Prime membership, which is free for 30 days before charging a monthly fee. From there, you can reap the benefits of on-sale luxury and drugstore beauty, along with the fashion must-haves, home décor findings, and more that Who What Wear editors have meticulously selected. Below, the Amazon beauty products that I buy on repeat (starting at just $4!) from brands such as Kiehl's, Laneige, Supergoop! , and more—plus a few big-ticket items I'd recommend snagging now that they're on sale. Editor-Approved Beauty Deals Under $30 Dr.Althea 345 Relief Cream Daily Face Moisturizer Of all the facial moisturizers I own, I never travel anywhere without the Dr.Althea 345 Relief Cream. I love this soothing cream for its niacinamide-forward formula, which helps quell my rosacea-induced redness, while hyaluronic acid and ceramides help hydrate the skin and lock in moisture. Plus, its squeeze-tube bottle makes it easily portable, which is why I never hesitate to hit buy when I spot it on sale. Wonderskin Wonder Blading Lip Stain Peel Off Masque I, along with the rest of the Who What Wear beauty team, fell in love with this best-selling viral lip stain from Amazon this year: the Wonderskin Wonder Blading Lip Stain that sent TikTok into a tizzy. All you do is let the dark formula sit for 10 to 30 seconds like a mask (I like to apply it like lip liner) before wiping it off with a damp towel for a tint that lasts for hours. Hero Cosmetics Mighty Patch Speaking of peeling things off, there's never been a better time to stock up on Hero's original pimple patches than while they're on sale for just $10. These hydrocolloid stickers work overnight to zap zits and whiteheads after just one use—no picking or popping necessary. I keep these patches in my medicine cabinet and pack a sheet in every carry-on for the inevitable travel-induced breakouts. Nécessaire The Body Wash Crowned one of our very favorite bodywashes this year, the Nécessaire The Body Wash is a necessity (get it?) for several reasons. It's made with a vitamin-rich formula that supports hydration, even skin tones, and smoother texture, and its gentle scent doesn't bother any of our beauty editors—even those of us with sensitive skin. Now, you can nab any scent for just $21. Briogeo Style + Treat Yuzu + Plum Oil Sleek Stick I, along with everyone else who favors a bad-hair-day updo, have a lot of love for the sleek, slicked-back bun. However, there were always stray hairs and breakage poking up at my hairline—that is until the Briogeo Sleek Stick came into my life. While other wax sticks at Amazon would take multiple washes to actually get out of my hair, this non-greasy, never-damaging wax offers a smooth, glossy finish that makes my strands feel soft and washes like a breeze, no scrubbing required. Oh, and did I mention it's a Who What Wear Beauty Award winner? Supergoop! Glowscreen SPF 40 I likely need not introduce you to the Supergoop! Glowscreen, but I do need to inform you that it's on sale and ripe for the taking. This radiant, tone-evening sunscreen offers a lit-from-within glow while smoothing your skin into a filter-like veil; its formula is pumped full of SPF 40 and hyaluronic acid for an extra dose of protection. It's not only a favorite tinted sunscreen, but it's a top-notch makeup primer, too. Essence Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara The Lash Princess False Lash Effect Mascara from Essence was already a steal at just $5 full-price, but at its Prime Day rate, buying a tube almost feels illegal. My fellow beauty editors have waxed poetic about this inexpensive formula for its impressive lengthening and curl-preserving powers, and I've personally bought this tube twice in the past year. No really, you need it. Shop More Editor Recommendations L'Oréal Paris True Match Lumi Glotion..."

Whether I need to restock my combination skincare routine or am looking to test a buzzy new beauty device, a great deal is always around the corner. Looks like it's true that good things come to those who wait—Amazon Prime Day is here just in time to refresh my summer beauty routine. From now through July 11, you can spot hundreds (if not thousands) of deals on Amazon in every major category, including summer shoes and vacation essentials. However, it's the sale of the year for beauty fans as top brands like Supergoop, Sol de Janeiro, Shark Beauty, Laneige, and so many more are at a major discount. To put it simply, Amazon Prime Day is not a sale you want to skip. To ensure you don't miss out on any of the incredible discounts, I'm bringing you the ultimate edit of Amazon Prime Day's best beauty deals. Ahead, uncover some of our editors' holy grail nail finds, skincare, fragrance, devices, makeup, and hair care currently on sale. Be sure to keep this page bookmarked, as the beauty deals will continue to arrive as I discover them in real-time. The Best Overall Beauty Deals at Amazon Prime Day Amazon Prime Day at a Glance Best Skincare Deals at Amazon Prime Day Supergoop! Unseen Sunscreen Spf 50 (Was $38) While technically this is a facial sunscreen, it doubles as a makeup primer that can be used anytime, anywhere. Katherine J. Igoe, an MC contributing editor, says, ""It goes on smoothly and feels incredibly lightweight without any of the annoyances of most sunscreens."" Katherine J. Igoe tests Supergoop! Unseen Sunscren SPF 50. (Image credit: MC Editors) Bioderma Bioderma Sensibio H2o Micellar Water (Was $14) Waterproof mascara, SPF, makeup, and dirt don't stand a chance with this French pharmacy favorite in your routine. A couple of drops on a cotton pad will remove your makeup, all while balancing pH, hydrating, and soothing skin. CeraVe Cerave Hydrating Cream to Foam Cleanser (Was $20) This cleanser is just what your skincare routine needs as a first step—it gently removes makeup and grime without drying out your skin. The cream lathers quickly into a foam, so a little bit goes a long way. Embryolisse Embryolisse Lait-Crème Concentré (Was $29) Another French beauty staple, this moisturizer will have your skin feeling baby soft and smooth in no time. It's a rich cream that deeply nourishes the skin, without feeling too heavy or leaving behind any greasiness. Kiehl's Avocado Eye Treatment (Was $38) This is one of the best eye creams for dryness, so it's not a bad idea to stock up before the fall. It uses avocado oil and caffeine to help smooth puffy eyes and fine lines and to boost radiance. Best Beauty Device Deals at Amazon Prime Day Shark Shark Hd430 Flexstyle Air Styling & Drying System (Was $350) As someone with minimal hair styling skills, the Shark FlexStyle is the only way I know how to do my hair. It's easy as can be to use, and I can create a variety of styles from big, bouncy curls to sleek blowouts. Brooke Knappenberger tests the auto-wrap curler attachments of the Shark FlexStyle. (Image credit: Brooke Knappenberger.) Braun Ipl Silk·expert Pro (Was $380) Marie Claire's fashion commerce editor, Julia Marzovilla, tested this laser hair device and raved about her results.

mov_FF01CBB2B88BCD4A1ED6B768510483A4,2025-07-08 17:46:14,en,WEB,"  Current Issue — Most Popular — Good sun habits. Sunscreen is a product people are constantly reminded to wear every single day. And for good reason: protecting your skin from the sun's ultraviolet rays—UVA, which causes premature aging, and UVB, which leads to sunburn and can contribute to skin cancer. But that doesn't mean it has to feel like a chore—especially when the right formula doubles as a makeup primer or hydrating lotion. Here are the best sunscreens to slot into your routine and keep you sun-safe (and glowing) all summer long. No matter which one you choose, don't forget to apply it properly: use a nickel-sized dollop or follow the two-finger rule to ensure your face and neck get the coverage they need. Apply 15 minutes before heading outside, and reapply every two hours—especially if you're swimming or sweating. Cle de Peau Beauté UV Protective Cream SPF 50+ This chemical sunscreen offers up to 10 hours of hydration. It features standout ingredients like Moroccan thyme extract, which helps combat signs of photoaging, along with plant extracts such as mangosteen and ginseng, as well as a complex with Japanese pearl shell extract to help leave the skin looking refreshed. Shiseido Ultra Sun Protector Lotion SPF 50+ This non-comedogenic formula offers coverage against both types of ultraviolet rays and is powered by innovative technology that actually strengthens protection when exposed to heat and water. Infused with plant extracts and amino acids that help defend against blue light and signs of aging, it's an ideal choice for those who are active in the sun. Naked Sundays SPF50+ Collagen Glow 100% Mineral Perfecting Priming Lotion This non-comedogenic mineral sunscreen features ingredients effective for sun protection without oxybenzone, linked to coral reef damage. Gentle enough for sensitive skin, it's also infused with watermelon extract and leaves a translucent finish (no white cast in sight). EltaMD UV Clear Tinted Broad-Spectrum SPF 46 EltaMD's tinted sunscreen offers protection against both UVA and UVB rays with a hybrid, non-comedogenic formula that combines both chemical and physical filters. The subtle tint provides a natural-looking glow with no white cast. Infused with niacinamide, hyaluronic acid, and vitamin E, it also has a lightweight texture that layers well under makeup and helps even out skin tone. La Roche-Posay Anthelios Mineral Tinted Ultra Fluid SPF 50 Facial Sunscreen Another standout physical sunscreen, this formula uses mineral-based titanium dioxide to deliver broad-spectrum protection. It's a good option for sensitive skin as it is non-comedogenic, gentle, and tinted for a natural glow. Infused with thermal spring water for antioxidant benefits, it absorbs quickly, making it an ideal base under makeup. Supergoop! Protec(tint) Daily SPF Tint SPF 50 Sunscreen Skin Tint Supergoop's Protec(tint) SPF offers both chemical and physical sun protection—plus clay infused with hyaluronic acid and additional defence against stress on skin from radiation, blue light, and pollution. Available in 14 shades, it's a sunscreen that doubles as complexion coverage. Paula's Choice Resist Youth-Extending Daily Hydrating Fluid SPF 50 This sunscreen offers chemical protection against UVA and UVB rays, and features ingredients such as oat bran, green tea, and grape seed extract for a soothing effect. It's a water-based formula aiming to calm and even the skin tone, leaving a smooth finish—ideal for someone who wears sunscreen on its own or layered under makeup.

The list represents the absolute best of the best in each category we cover, featuring insights from our staff and industry experts. With Amazon Prime Day well underway, we've catalogued every winner on sale right now below, including 45% off our favorite water flosser, 25% off our top self-tanner, and 24% off this excellent personal blender. We stand by the quality and value of every item on this list even at full price, so when they're on sale you can be certain you're picking a winner. In addition to the extensive testing we've done on the products below, the deals featured here have been price-checked across multiple retailers and vetted by our deals staff.

It's an easy way to help maintain your dental hygiene, especially those harder to reach spaces in your mouth. Waterpik is like the Kleenex of the water flosser world and the Aquarius is our favorite model overall. It's powerful, versatile and carries an ADA seal of approval—which is not universal to all water flossers. This Prime Day deal is the best price we've seen for this model in 2025. Solo Stove Bonfire 2.0 Smokeless Fire Pit With Stand Fire pits are a year-round staple, whether you're camping, posted up at the beach or hanging out in your backyard. Solo Stove's portable smokeless design is our favorite fire pit overall for its efficiency and versatility. Just be warned: I let my dad borrow mine for a road trip and he never gave it back. A 20% discount on the solo stove is not atypical, but it's still a nice opportunity to grab one on sale if you're in the market. Field Company No.8 Cast-Iron Skillet This upgraded cast-iron is ideal for home cooks ready to invest in an heirloom-quality piece. The Field's skillet is lightweight—roughly a pound lighter than other designs we tested—and has a smooth cooking surface that helps create a nonstick barrier for delicate foods like eggs. Better yet: This discount is the best price we've seen for this skillet on Amazon. Supergoop PLAY Everyday Lotion SPF 50 Our favorite sunscreen hydrates, calms and protects your skin from the sun without leaving you feeling greasy. Its formula helps block UVA, UVB and infrared radiation, and it can hold up against sweat and water for over an hour. You can also use the lotion head-to-toe for quick, full-body coverage. Supergoop hosts semi-regular sales online, but this is still a great time to stock up for summer. Away The Bigger Carry-On Luggage You've likely heard of Away by now. The trendy suitcase brand is a favorite among our editors and the maker of our pick for the best carry-on luggage overall. The Bigger Carry-On is spacious, durable and thoughtfully designed with an internal compression system that makes it easier to fit everything you need in your bag. This 20% discount is limited to select colorways, including the pictured Cloud Gray above. Other colors are available for 15% off. St.Tropez Self Tan Express Mousse We love a sun-kissed tan; a good self-tanner can help give you that beachy look without the potential sun damage. Our favorite formula is an easy-to-apply mousse that absorbs quickly...."

mov_8FA0902E303B553C6016F99206C985DE,2025-07-09 14:43:34,en,WEB,"  When it comes to skincare, I favour low-maintenance, hybrid formulas that can shave minutes off my routine. Eliminating the need for multiple steps, tinted SPFs protect my skin from sun damage and give me glowy, pigmented coverage. Tick, tick, tick. But with some of the best formulas on the market costing upwards of £30 for a small tube (we're looking at you, Ultra Violette and Supergoop!) , I'm always looking for budget buys that can do the job just as well. Enter: Garnier's vitamin C daily UV brightening fluid glow (a mouthful, I know). My go-to affordable tinted SPF, the lightweight formula has a creamy consistency that's easy to blend across your face, while SPF50 has all bases covered when it comes to sun protection. Designed to be one-shade-fits-all, the cream gives your skin a glowy and lightweight coverage. The slimline tube is perfect for packing in your beach bag on holiday and topping up when you want a little more coverage after a dip in the sea. The best part is that it costs a little more than £10 – but it's now even cheaper thanks to Amazon Prime Day. Whether you're jetting off on holiday, enjoying the first sunny days of spring or looking for a new everyday skincare staple, here's why Garnier's tinted SPF should be in your next beauty haul. How we tested Testing the vitamin C-infused formula alongside more premium products, I've worn it for beach days and office days. Considering the ease of application (whether with a brush, sponge or fingers), coverage claims, staying power, the look and feel on my skin, as well as its SPF credentials, here's my verdict on Garnier's tinted SPF. The verdict: Garnier vitamin C daily UV brightening fluid glow Easily rivalling more premium tinted SPF formulas, Garnier's vitamin C face cream not only provides SPF50 protection but also gives skin a glowy, lightweight coverage. The finish is long-lasting and dewy, while the value for money is stellar at £5. Looking for more tinted SPF recommendations? We've rounded up our favourite formulas"

This 40-ounce mother of mugs carries as much fluid as a 7-Eleven Super Big Gulp while stylishly keeping hot drinks hot and cold drinks cold, and it still fits in most car cup holders.

You work hard, so you deserve nice things. And if you don't work hard, well, who am I to judge? Everyone's earned a lil' treat, in my humble opinion. Whether it's a completely unnecessary bottle of hand sanitizer you impulse-buy at checkout (despite having a personal stockpile rattling around in your bag) or a quick online shopping break during work hours just to feel something, I fully support it. A “lil' treat” can be anything, really. It's how we cope in the modern world (have you seen the news?) . And right now, thanks to Amazon's Prime Day Sale, you can snag some delightfully unnecessary-but-deeply-satisfying goodies for $50 or less.

There's also the Sol de Janeiro hair mist and body spray, which smells like a beach vacation, and a silky Kitsch satin pillowcase that promises to help protect your hair — all discounted and mostly priced between $10 and $30. LANEIGE Lip Sleeping Mask $16.80 $24.00 30% off Buy Now On Amazon But let's be clear: a lil' treat (noun) is not limited to what's on this list. It just needs to be something that makes you feel happy.

So go ahead. Shop our must-buy lil' treats during Amazon Prime Day (running through July 11, 2025).

The Best Prime Day Beauty Deals, By Category Sometimes you want to peruse the deals, other times, you know exactly what you're looking for. To help you quickly find a specific item, we've broken our guide into categories below. Prime Day Makeup Deals—Up to 40% Off Summer beauty routines call for lightweight formulas like skin tints enriched with SPF—and a good brow, via Anastasia Beverly Hills's beloved pencil. Of course, some products stand the test of time no matter the season, like lengthening mascaras such as L'Oréal Paris's formula, which gives you the illusion of eyelash extensions. You'll also need a waterproof mascara and eyeliner that holds up against dips in the pool.

They used a trending format their audience actually watches, dropped in little cues that feel familiar (hello, Aperol Spritz + monogrammed tote), and still made a solid, problem-solution style ad. What's smart? The “problem” isn't bad sunscreen — it's no sunscreen. So buying feels urgent, and the ""solution"" is right there: Amazon.

We'll do our best to keep this post and imagery as up-to-date as possible, but we can't catch everything immediately. Check back throughout the day to see our latest updates as the deals change!

Oh, and once you realize how much easier (and better for our planet) this is than liquid detergent/pods, you'll never want to go back, so prepare wisely now. Promising review: ""I absolutely love these laundry tablets. I have always felt guilty about throwing such a large plastic jug away, and now I don't have to! I love how compact these tablets are; it makes them perfect even for traveling, and they leave my clothes smelling great. They work well with both hot and cold water, so I have no complaints!"" —Eme N. Price: $20.99 (originally $29.99) 2. Supergoop best-sellers for 20% off, including the wildly popular Glowscreen SPF 40 for anyone who wants a super glowy, lit-from-within complexion at all times. Better yet, it doubles as a makeup-gripping primer, so your glow will shine through your foundation while keeping you protected. Promising review: ""I've tried a lot of sunscreen and primers over the last year. I mean A LOT. My skin is super sensitive, acne-prone, and prone to dryness and redness. (Complicated, I know) This stuff doesn't feel heavy and moisturizes really well while not feeling like I'll break out later. It protected my skin from sunburn during six hours at Six Flags. I don't wear a ton of makeup, but the foundation and bronzer I wore didn't budge or crease. It makes your skin glow like [wild], which alone is a bit much for me, but under some foundation, it looks amazing! Def worth the buy and will buy again."" —H.E. Price: $17.60+ (originally $22+; available in three sizes and four shades; see more Supergoop deals here) 3. An Amazon Fire TV Stick 4K for 50% off — if you've been putting off upgrading your old one or getting another one for your guest room, then now is the time to do it! Use this to stream over a million movies and shows, plus it even has an AI-powered TV search to help you find exactly what you need without struggling to type it in. Promising review: ""The Alexa Fire Stick might be the greatest invention since drive-thru coffee. I plugged it in, blinked twice, and boom — it was up and running. I didn't need a tech degree or a YouTube tutorial narrated by someone whispering in a British accent. Setup? Ridiculously simple. Navigation? Smooth like jazz. Lag? Nonexistent. This thing moves faster than I do when someone says, “Free snacks in the break room.” I press the mic button and say, “Find mystery shows,” and Alexa serves them up like a psychic with a popcorn addiction. No scrolling, no back-and-forth, no spelling out titles like I'm on Wheel of Fortune. The layout is clean and makes actual sense. Everything I want is right there. It's like it knows I'm too tired to think after 8 p.m. and hands me exactly what I didn't know I needed. Bonus: It's tiny. I've lost it in the couch cushions twice, but it always comes back...."

n2igwby,2025-07-11 07:59:01,en,REDDIT,"  I'm not saying this to be argumentative, but I can't find a way to word it otherwise. I'd like you to try and explain why a non-Australian sunscreen wouldn't be ok to use for extended periods in the sun here if they have the same ratings. I think you misunderstand what ""Australian standards"" actually are. Though obviously not the entirety of it, they largely boil down to picking what filters are known factors and okay to use. Korea is faster to approve new filters due to how their own regulations work; which means they end up with more cosmetically elegant products and avoid the use of the typical ingredients that give the ""greasy"" feel sunscreen is known for. Australia is fast compared to the US, but is still a bit ""behind the times"" in this regard. But conversely, it's not like the filters Korea is using are new and not yet tested/proven. Again, I want to emphasise - plenty of these products have widely available, peer-reviewed and cross-tested results. Because they're mostly white-label, it shouldn't scare you that they're using newer filters than those in Australian formulas at the moment. They're proven formulas. Australia is just slower to approve them, and that may not even be due to Australia doing more rigorous testing. They're just classified differently here, so the approval process takes longer. The story Lab Muffin/Michelle brings up about the SuperGOOP sunscreen wasn't mentioned to downplay that sunscreen's efficacy (I know nothing about it). If that was her intent, she wouldn't have spent the rest of the video recommending imported sunscreens. Her language is English-speaking; by this logic, she would have no reason to bring up Asian market sunscreens. Look at what she says prior to that; Australian restrictions are preventing the discussion of Australian sunscreen products online, but she believes more discussion should be encouraged because it lessens the reputation of sunscreen as cosmetically inelegant and just overall ""undesirable."" When influencers talk more about the sunscreens that have worked for them and feel good to use, it turns sunscreen into a product people actually WANT to use - which is the main issue affecting how many people adequately protect themselves from the sun. I want to emphasise too that nowhere in her video does she say Australian sunscreens will be more effective than others in the Australian sun. There is another video she talks about this more, it may be one of her more recent ""Correcting Misinformation"" videos. Forgive me, I'm at work so I can't get the link. Could have been a short debunking another woman on YouTube who was spreading misinformation? Unsure. One example: Biore UV (one of the first Asian sunscreens to get huge overseas) has four filters that are approved in Australia, and all it's formulations have been tested incredibly rigorously under ISO methods that Australia accepts. However, the company hasn't brought it over here because they'd have to get it listed on the ARTG, get their factories certified in GMP (not particularly related to sunscreen testing; just general manufacturing practice), manufacture with new labeling that meets our regulations, among a multitude of other costs to keep their product on Australian shelves. Plus, being a water-resistant sunscreen (and arguably one of the best), there are even more things they'd need to pay for certification on. It's just not worth it for many overseas companies. That does not mean that the overseas testing it has had done on it is less valid than Australian testing. It meets Australian standards in terms of testing procedure and formulation, but that doesn't suddenly mean the company has the go ahead to sell it here. (3/4, Reddit wouldn't let me post the whole thing in one)"
mov_E9341563588A2F77AF5CA430D6A324C5,2025-07-11 08:00:00,en,WEB,"  Depending on how similar the items are, and the rights a company holds, dupes may or may not cross legal lines To customers, a lookalike to Ugg's Tasman slippers or a knock-off of Lululemon's ultra-popular Define jacket can be a fantastic bargain. But to the companies that make the original products, similar-but-cheaper items can be bad for business. While knock-offs are nothing new, dupes — short for ""duplicate"" — have exploded in popularity in recent years. And for many younger buyers, buying an imitation is no longer something to hide. ""A lot of the consumers that we're seeing on social media, on TikTok, are so proudly displaying the dupes that they found, kind of as a badge of honour. That stigma really isn't there anymore,"" said Julie Zerbo, editor-in-chief of fashion publication The Fashion Law. The rise of dupes has also brought a corresponding wave of lawsuits from companies, saying copies of their products shouldn't be allowed to exist. American Eagle, Sol de Janeiro, Benefit Cosmetics, Deckers Brands (Ugg's parent company) and Supergoop are just a few of the fashion and beauty companies on that list. Vancouver-based Lululemon became a recent entrant when it sued Costco late last month over three products it said were knock-offs of its clothing. But are they actually illegal? Intellectual property experts say it really depends on the rights a company has over a product, and whether customers can tell the difference between the original and its copycat. When do dupes cross the line? The term ""dupe"" itself has been appearing more in legal filings, says Alexandra Roberts, law and media professor at Northeastern University — including in Lululemon's against Costco. That could partially be because their appeal has grown among online shoppers. ""Where in previous years, a company might have just said, 'Oh, this looks to us like trademark infringement,' here, [brands] are kind of building a case around the idea of [a] dupe,"" Roberts said. ""The fact that something is perceived as a dupe ... that all works its way into the allegations."" WATCH | Trying to beat online fashion copies: Trying to beat online fashion copies 8 months agoDuration 2:25 Loren Mallett, an intellectual property lawyer in Vancouver, says any case where a company says it's been copied largely depends on the rights it has over its product. Patents, industrial designs and trademarks can all protect certain parts of an item — but a company has to formally register elements like its logo or packaging design. If it hasn't, it's probably out of luck, Mallett says. And even if it has, it still might be OK to sell something really similar. The legality of a dupe depends on whether customers could be confused by the two items and think they are the exact same, Roberts says. In Lululemon's case, for example, the question might be whether buyers of the Costco sweatshirt thought they were purchasing Lululemon's Scuba hoodie, Roberts says. She says people tend to like dupes specifically because they aren't the real deal, but a cheaper alternative. And for that reason, she says, many may not be successfully litigated against. LISTEN | Dupe culture: Why Gen Z is embracing fakes: While we don't necessarily think of them as dupes, generic brands — think Life brand products sold at Shoppers Drug Mart, or Walmart's Great Value — have occupied this space for a long time, Roberts says. And historically, courts have allowed them because customers understand that one is meant to be a cheaper alternative to the other. Mallett adds that the conversation around dupes could impact companies like Lululemon in court, as many customers have said online that some of Costco's products look just like Lululemon's. The athleisure company will likely argue this as evidence that Costco wanted to pass off its product as a Lululemon item — whereas Costco will likely say it is proof the customer knew for a fact they were buying a similar-looking alternative at a lower price, according to Mallett. A case study Zerbo says many dupe-related cases are still making their way through courts. But there are some resolved ones where the lookalike has come out on top. She points to a recent conflict in the U.S. between Steve Madden and Ganni as a good example. Danish footwear brand Ganni sent cease-and-desist letters to some companies that sold certain Steve Madden shoes, saying they looked too similar to its own buckle ballerina flats and two-strap sandals. But Steve Madden turned around and sued Ganni, saying it had no right to tell those retailers they couldn't sell the similar Steve Madden shoes, because there was ""nothing new or original"" about a shoe made of leather and that has straps, eyelets and buckles — common elements in lots of footwear. Ganni ultimately walked back its original legal threats, Zerbo said, and even agreed not to sue in the future over the shoe designs. (Ganni was more successful in its home country of Denmark, however.) Zerbo says these cases show how courts generally don't want monopolies, and try to prevent giving a brand that kind of power. ""That would be bad for competition, that would be bad for consumers, prices would go through the roof."" What does that mean for my dupes? Zerbo says duping is unlikely to slow down anytime soon, as many shoppers love a good deal. She says history is full of copycat designs, which have largely been allowed to exist. Take fast fashion, for example. Companies like H&M and Forever 21 became giants mainly by replicating runway elements for a cheaper price. ""It's such a big market. There's so much consumer demand for dupes that companies would be hard pressed to stop trying to make them.""..."

News I don't mean to alarm you, but there are fewer than 24 hours before Amazon Prime Day 2025 officially ends on July 11. Have you refreshed your minimalist wardrobe with the best fashion basics deals yet? Or have you picked up your favorite discounted summer beauty products? If not, don't fret—navigating the thousands of Prime Day clothing, shoes, and beauty deals can be overwhelming. That's why I'm sharing my curated selection of the best last-chance deals worth adding to your cart before Prime Day is over. Ahead, I've rounded up the can't-miss deals of Amazon Prime Day across every major category. There are summer travel essentials like linen pants, matching sets, and my favorite-ever headphones for airplanes. I also included it-girl-approved summery shoes to hold you over for the rest of the season. On the beauty front, expect to find deals on nail polishes and beauty devices, as well as my holy-grail sunscreen and laser hair removal device. Without further ado, see below for all of the Amazon Prime Day deals you don't want to miss. If you haven't filled up your cart just yet, I can practically guarantee you'll want to after seeing these picks. Marie Claire's Favorite Amazon Prime Day Last Chance Deals - Best Top Deal: SUUKSESS Women Cotton Ribbed Tank Tops (Was $40), Now $15 - Best Denim Deal: Levi's Women's Classic Bootcut Jeans (Were $60), Now $29 - Best Sandals Deal: Cushionaire Voyage Cutout Strap Slides (Were $65), Now $38 - Best Accessory Deal: Julunar Silk Like Head Scarf for Women (Was $14), Now $10 - Best Travel Essential Deal: Beats Studio Pro - Wireless Bluetooth Noise Cancelling Headphones (Were $350), Now $170 - Best Makeup Deal: Laneige Lip Sleeping Mask (Was $24), Now $17 - Best Skincare Deal: Supergoop!

These headphones were a personal Amazon Prime Day purchase that may be the best deal I've spotted of the entire sale event. Not only is the sound quality incredible, but I'm obsessed with being able to easily switch between the two listening modes, Noise Canceling and Transparency. These are the exact white tank tops Kendall Jenner loves. With how many ways you can style this button-down shirt, it's well worth adding to your cart. This summer dress would be so easy to throw on with sandals. These cute wedges fit summer's boho fashion trend to a T. You can never have too many staple tank tops. Wear this loungewear set to the airport to stay comfortable and stylish. How cool are these fisherman sandals? If this bag is good enough for Bella Hadid, it's good enough for me. Last Chance Amazon Prime Day Beauty Deals If your skills in hair styling are lacking, you need the Shark Flexstyle in your life. It makes doing a variety of styles, from voluminous curls to sleek blowouts, as easy as can be. One of the best upgrades you can make to your beauty routine is by investing in this laser hair device. Our tester used this device for 10 weeks and says, ""Hair growth overall starts to slow down and return more gradually, and by week 10, it has essentially stopped growing in my underarm area, returning very slowly on my bikini line and legs."" Two neutral nail polish colors for the price of one is a steal in my book. The coolest girls I know are wearing French hairpins instead of claw clips this summer. In 2025, we're only tanning the safe way. Use this fan-favorite gradual self-tanner for a natural, hydrated glow. It gets bonus points for its firming formula, too. When you're in need of a little more coverage, this tinted sunscreen will do the trick. It covers dark spots and pigmentation, all while offering SPF 50 sun protection...."

Avant de s'exposer au soleil, on veille à protéger notre corps et notre visage. On choisit alors la bonne crème solaire, on l'applique méticuleusement sur les épaules, le dos, les bras, le visage, le cou... Pourtant, une zone manque souvent à l'appel. Si on met de la crème SPF sur le visage, on ne pense pas toujours aux lèvres. Les lèvres aussi ont besoin d'être protégées du soleil et de rester hydratées. La peau y est particulièrement fine et délicate, donc susceptible de prendre un coup de soleil. Comment reconnaître un coup de soleil sur les lèvres? Si vos lèvres ont trop pris le soleil et n'ont pas été protégées, en cas de coup de soleil léger, elles seront sèches et irritées. Si celui-ci est intense, des cloques blanches peuvent survenir, ainsi que des saignements. La lèvre inférieure sera très certainement la plus touchée, puisque c'est celle qui capte le plus la lumière. Comment traiter le coup de soleil sur les lèvres? Si le coup de soleil est léger, hydratez vos lèvres régulièrement. Vous pouvez utiliser de l'aloe vera que vous aurez au préalable laissé refroidir au réfrigérateur. L'irritation peut aussi être soulagée par un gant de toilette humide qui va rafraîchir la zone. N'arrachez pas la peau sèche, elle se détachera toute seule lorsque la nouvelle sera prête. Si le coup de soleil est intense, n'essayez pas de faire éclater les cloques. Laissez-les disparaître d'elles-mêmes. Elles peuvent rester de 5 à 15 jours, alors faites preuve de patience. Prenez le temps de laisser vos lèvres se remettre du coup de soleil, notamment en évitant de vous exposer aux rayons UV. De plus, n'utilisez pas de produits potentiellement irritants, contenant des acides alpha, bêta-hydroxy, des rétinoïdes ou des ingrédients qui font gonfler les lèvres. Pour favoriser la cicatrisation, appliquez une hydratation régulièrement sur vos lèvres qui renforcera la barrière cutanée. Comment prévenir les coups de soleil sur les lèvres? Certains baumes à lèvres sont conçus spécialement pour nous accompagner tout au long de l'été. Les soins pour les lèvres avec un SPF peuvent être appliqués quotidiennement, tout comme votre crème de jour et votre crème solaire. Pour prendre soin de votre bouche, ne les oubliez pas.

F9FF1ED945484C3B3A037914D4F5E44A,2025-07-12 07:24:56,en,PRINT,"  With the unforgiving ultraviolet rays beating down on them, lifeguards have to take extra care to protect their skin while keeping everyone else safe, too. We spoke with three certified lifeguards about their go-to sun protection strategies. ELISSA SANCI Lean into wearable sun protection. The best way to prevent sunburn is to keep your skin hidden from the sun. '' I try to stay as covered as possible even when it's pretty hot out,'' said Tess King, a Los Angeles County lifeguard. She wears a long-sleeve county-issued cotton sweatshirt when on duty. Other lifeguards opt for UV-protective clothing. Tommi Dubinski, a New York City--based lifeguard and emergency medical technician, is always decked out in protective sun clothing. One of her preferred items is the Outdoor Research Echo Hoodie, and she's a fan of Buff's UV neck gaiters. Wyatt Werneth, who has over 30 years of open-water lifeguarding experience in Cocoa Beach, Fla., said he keeps himself covered with a combination of sun shirts, sun hats and gaiters. Slather on the sunscreen, and reapply often. Wearing sunscreen is an extremely important part of sun safety. If you plan to spend long stretches of time outside, reapplying it multiple times is critical. At the beginning of her shift, Ms. King slathers herself in the sunscreen she's been using for 10 years: Blue Lizard Sensitive Mineral SPF 50 Sunscreen Lotion. She'll reapply Blue Lizard three to four times during her typical eight to 10 hours in the sun. Ms. King also swears by the tinted Vertra Sunscreen Face Stick SPF 38, which she uses as her primary face coverage. Ms. Dubinski's go-to body sunscreen is Supergoop Play Everyday Lotion SPF 50, a longtime Wirecutter pick. She likes that it doesn't feel tacky or greasy. Mr. Werneth keeps spray sunscreen on hand to use in a pinch. But if you do burn, this can help. Even the pros suffer from sunburn occasionally. The key is knowing how to treat the sting of your sunburn. '' Basic sunburn is considered a first-degree burn,'' Ms. Dubinski said, ''and the first thing we're taught in E.M.S. training is to stop the burn process. That could mean covering up, getting out of the sun, taking a cool shower.'' Once your skin is clean and cooled, reach for soothing topical creams. Ms. King treats her sunburns with Vanicream Moisturizing Cream.Elissa Sanci is a senior staff writer at Wirecutter, a product recommendation site owned by The New York Times Company.

It's safe for babies, children, and adults, so it helps reduce the number of products on your bathroom vanity! It's non-greasy and formulated with shea butter and niacinamide to restore the skin's protective barrier. Promising review: ""Most people have already said it perfectly — this is extraordinary. I use it on my face at night and feel the moisturizing effects last through the next morning and beyond. I've tried dozens of products all across price ranges, and this is just super special. I love that it is a bit thick, and it feels really pure. I don't know what the magic is here, but whatever they did could easily cost 5x the price. It evens tone, helps with wrinkles, refines pores, skin glows, and does not irritate. It is great to see others also recognize that this cream is uniquely awesome!"" —Trever Fadrhonc Get it from Amazon for $15.99+ (available in two sizes). 3. Hawaiian Tropic's SPF 30 Mineral Powder Sunscreen Brush finally solves your dilemma over whether to spray/rub sunscreen onto your exposed scalp. Simply brush this translucent powder along your exposed part/hairline (after applying it all over your face, of course) to add some much-needed protection from the sun. Note that the AAD recommends using at least SPF 30 and reapplying as needed for skin protection. You can read about sunscreen myths and facts from dermatologists for more information! Promising review: ""Wish I would have found this sooner! Works great and so far the cheapest option I have found for powder sunscreen. Love that my face isn't greasy anymore from normal sunscreen!"" —Michelle ""I have fine hair so anytime I'm in the sun I get burnt on my scalp. Regular sunscreen make my hair super oily and gross and I cannot stand wearing hats. I'm so glad I found this. You do have to apply it more often, and also it doesn't work if it gets wet. Love this stuff, it's such a lifesaver."" —james Get it from Amazon for $16.99. Psst: if you're looking to add a bit more *pizzazz* to your skin protection, try out Supergoop! (Glow) setting Mineral Powder. I've been using it the same way I'd use this product, but loving that it leaves a subtle shimmer all over my skin! 4. A skin-firming neck and chest Gold Bond cream because chances are you've been neglecting these specific skin areas for years — well, now it's their time to shine! This cream is packed with hydrating hyaluronic acid and has been crafted to improve skin's elasticity and texture. TL;DR: you're welcome for introducing you to this magical stuff. Promising review: ""This product is the real deal. The first time I used it, I noticed a definite softening of the lines on my neck. I have been using it for about a week and it has made a noticeable difference. No, the wrinkles are not completely gone but there is a real difference...."

n2z87a8,2025-07-13 22:40:09,en,REDDIT,"  1. I've been using Sally Hansen Cuticle Massage Cream for decades. I keep a pot of it in my nightstand, a decanted one in a cute little pot next to the couch, and another decanted fliptop make-up sample container in the sunglasses compartment of my car. (I use a fliptop, because when I used a screwtop, I was always dropping the top. 😜) I slather some on any ole time I think of it. 1A. Oh, and I keep a contact lens case in my purse and my toiletry kit for when I travel… L side has Working Hands (lotion 😉) R side has the Sally Hansen cuticle cream. 2. Sunscreen on back of my my hands - face, neck, décolleté, back of hands, and forearms… DAILY 365 / rain or shine for the last 40 years. 3. Solbari driving gloves or sleeves Australian company / Amazon. I have a short version that I use when I'm wearing long sleeves, and the full sleeve version for when I'm wearing short sleeves. I put them in a lingerie bag to wash them every couple of weeks. Hang to dry. My wrist measurement is ~ 6.25” / 16cm and the medium size works well for me. 4. I keep a 1 oz  tube of Supergoop Hand Screen in the front pocket of my purse and apply it often when I'm out and about. Doesn't have to be Supergoop.) 5. Sally Hansen Instant Cuticle Remover… be sure to leave it on only 15 to 30 seconds. I use an wooden orange stick to push my cuticles back after it's been on for a bit, and then scrub it off gently with a nail brush. I use it once a week when I remember. 6. It is NOT a good idea to cut your cuticles back. You can probably Google that info. And “That's all Folks!”"
